<OPENER><SALUTE>GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>PROPRIETY and affection alike incline me to inscribe to you the
follow∣ing undertaking. We are mutual and peculiar sufferers by the event of
the campaign in 1777. You were witnesses and judges of my actions; but I
owed you an account of the principles which directed them.</P>
<P>Another motive for this Address is to avail myself of a proper
public op∣portunity to repeat to you, what I have omitted no occasion of
expressing in Parliament, in correspondence, and in
conversation—the fullest approbation of your services. My errors
may have been numberless; your conduct has been uniform—faithful,
gallant and indefatigable. Debarred of the power of doing you justice before
the King, these testimonies are the only means to which my esteem and
gratitude can resort.</P>
<P>After vindicating myself as a commanding officer from any
inattention to your interest or fame, I next throw myself upon your
judgment for my con∣duct as a friend.</P>
<P>You will find by this publication, and some others, which though
not addressed to you will probably engage your curiosity, that I have
been accused of shrinking from the common captivity.</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="4"/> I have been supported under that
aspersion by the consciousness I did not deserve it, and the
confidence that you (to whom chiefly upon that charge I was responsible)
would not adopt it. After the fortunes we have run to∣gether, it is not
surely unworthy of belief, that I should rather have desired, than
avoided to partake the closing scene: uniting with a due sense of
per∣sonal attachments, the preservation of my military fortune, and a
retreat from the distractions of my country. The defence of your honour and
my own, at one time, and resistance to an affront<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The part of my treatment which I call an affront upon this and
other occasions, is the re∣fusal of my service in this country, even at
the head of my own regiment, or as a volunteer, in the time of exigency, and
when other officers <HI>precisely in my own situation</HI> were employed.
My complaint of this partiality has never been officially answered; it has
only been evaded by anonymous writers, who have laid it down as a position,
that I meant to allude to the example of Lord Harrington (with which it
certainly has nothing to do) and then have taken a merit in refuting me. The
particular example to which I appeal is that of Lieutenant Colonel King∣ston,
of the 86th regiment, appointed to that regiment, employed in it for the
defence of Ply∣mouth, and actually now embarking with it for foreign service,
under the same terms of the convention, and the same terms of parole to the
Congress verbatim with myself. Other objec∣tions, and of a nature that
could not be afterwards supported, were tried against the Duke of Rutland's
recommendation of this excellent officer: but the objection of parole, though
fully known to be precisely the same with that which was so peremptorily
urged against my preten∣sions, was never mentioned.</NOTE> which my nature
could not bear, at another, alone detained me here.</P>
<P>In regard to my political transactions, I have stated them,
and I wish them to be considered by my friends, apart from my miltary
conduct. I bear very high respect to some eminent and ill-treated
characters in our pro∣fession, who in deference to the tranquility of
government, have silently re∣signed the stations which they could no
longer hold with security to their honour, or benefit to the state. But the
option is not left to those, who ha∣ving a voice in Parliament are obliged to
act as citizens as well as soldiers. The number of officers altogether of the
army and navy, who with known love to their country and professional
spirit equally conspicuous, have vo∣luntarily withdrawn themselves from
employment within these two years, exceeds all precedent. I do not place my
name in the list with the same pretensions; but it is not arrogant to
emulate where we cannot compare; and I am desirous of following the high
examples before me in no point more than in that of avoiding to disturb the
zeal of those who are now em∣ployed. The officers who have held it their duty
to take part in opposition, have acted openly and directly in their place in
Parliament; but they may <PB N="v" REF="5"/> defy malice to shew an instance
wherein they have not encouraged ardour in their profession. They
contemplate with one and the same sentiment the great supply of
honourable men to occupy their places.</P>
<P>You, Gentlemen, stand high in that description; your trials
have made you of sterling value; and perhaps it will be better discerned by
men in power, when no longer viewed through the unfavourable medium of my
friendship. If my exhortations retain their former weight, let me be
permit∣ted earnestly to apply them upon this occasion. The examples of
generals or admirals who decline employment, respect only similar cases;
your honour is secure: look not at professional disappointments; but
point all your views to the true glory of your King and country, and trust
for the reward.</P>

<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN it becomes necessary for men who have acted critical
parts in public stations to make an appeal to the world in their own
justification, there are many prudential considerations which might lead
them to commit the care of it to friends, or, which is in many respects the
same thing, to defend themselves under an assumed character. The charge
of vanity usually made on egotism is thus eluded: a fuller scope may be
given to self-love and parti∣cular resentment: even the lower vexations
which attend an author are to a great degree avoided: the ill-nature of
criticism is seldom awakened by anonymous writings, and the venal pens of
party lose half their gall when the object of it is not personally and
directly in question.</P>
<P>But there are situations, in which, not only general assent
seems to justify a man in speaking of himself, but in which also no
little consideration ought to be admitted to the mind. Such will be the
case, if I am not deceived, when the interests of the public are blended
with those of the individual; and when his very errors may serve as
instruction to others. Misfortunes which awaken sensibility will be a
further, and a persuasive call, upon the <HI>attention</HI> of the public;
and it will amount to a claim upon their <HI>justice,</HI> if he can shew
that he has been injuriously treated.</P>
<P>Upon maturely weighing these and several other
circumstances, after I had been denied a professional examination of my
conduct, and disappointed of a parliamentary one, I determined to lay before
the public a state of the expe∣dition from Canada, in 1777, in my own name.
And my first design was to do it under the title, and with the latitude of
Memoirs; as a mode by which I could best open the principles of my actions,
and introduce, with most propriety, collateral characters, incidents, and
discussions, as they might occasionally tend to illustrate the main
subject.</P>
<P>However, in the last session of Parliament, the enquiry
which had not been agreed to the year before, took place. I had pressed it,
and I entered into it under all the disadvantages which attend a struggle
with power, and <PB N="viii" REF="7"/> the prejudice that power can raise
against the persons it means to destroy. The utmost that power could do
was done; the Paliament was prorogued pending the proceedings. But though by
this contrivance, a final and for∣mal adjudication by that august
assembly was avoided, their minutes stand a sacred record of truth and
justice, and the most satisfactory reliance to which my wishes could
aspire, in offering my actions to the judgment of my country at large.</P>
<P>From that time, therefore, I resolved to publish, instead of
Memoirs, the Proceedings precisely as they passed in Parliament, and to
continue my de∣fence by such Observations and Comments upon the Evidence,
as I should have had a right, and was prepared to make, had the proceedings
in the house continued.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The order in which the
committee in the House of Commons proceeded was, to hear Sir William Howe's
Narrative, respecting his conduct whilst in command in America, and such
evidence as he thought proper to bring in support of it. They next heard my
Narrative and Evidence, respecting the conduct of the expedition from Canada.
Lord George Germain then opened a defence on his part, and summoned
witnesses to support it. According to the arrange∣ment made by the
committee, Sir William Howe and myself were afterwards to be heard in reply;
but the proceedings were ended by the prorogation of Parliament before the
examina∣tion of Lord George's second witness, Mr. Galloway, was closed,
and there were sixteen or eigh∣teen more upon his list. The order in which
the following papers are placed is—1st. The Pre∣fatory Speech. 2d. The
Narrative. 3d. Minutes of the verbal evidence. 4th. Review of the evidence,
with Remarks and Explanations, &amp;c. 5th. An Appendix, containing the written
evi∣dence.</NOTE></P>
<P>Possibly in this latter part some colour of my original
design may remain. The scenes I have been engaged in are uncommon, and it
is a natural desire to place them in a full light. The interests concerned
make that desire more urgent; and I dare believe they will be best guarded
by being most ex∣plained.</P>

<HEAD>The SPEECH of Lieutenant General BURGOYNE, prefatory to his
NARRATIVE.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MR. MONTAGU,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>BEFORE I enter upon the narrative, which the precedent of your
late proceedings authorises me to lay before you, I think it a duty to the
committee, to promise that I shall trouble them with little other matter
than such as may be necessary to elucidate the transactions of the
campaign 1777, in that quarter where I commanded.</P>
<P>I shall keep in mind, that to explain the causes of the
disaster at Saratoga is the principal point to which all my evidence ought
to lead: but at the same time, I shall take confidence in the justice and
benevolence of my hearers, that where arguments in exculpation of the commander
can aptly be combined with a faithful representa∣tion of facts, they will not
be deemed foreign to the main object under their consi∣deration.</P>
<P>Upon these ideas, though some introductory explanations are
requisite, I shall suppress the inclination I at first conceived, of
stating my conduct from the time, when, conjointly with my honourable friend
who took the lead in this enquiry,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sir William
Howe.</NOTE> I was called to the unsolicited and unwelcome service in
America: nor will I enume∣rate the complicated circumstances of private
misfortune and ill health under which I pursued it. Prudence, as well as
other propriety, is, I confess, consulted in this suppression; for
were it seen, that an officer had blended with the respect due to
authority, warm, though disinterested personal attachments; that under a
persuasion of the honour and integrity of the king's servants, he had
united to his zeal for the public cause an interest in their private credit
and ambition; would it not be con∣ceived, that his guilt must have been
atrocious, beyond all excuse or palliation, to induce the very men to whom
his endeavours, and his faculties, such as they were, had been thus devoted,
not only completely to desert him, but to preclude him, as far as in them
lay, from every means of defence, and if possible, to ruin him in the
opinion of the king, the army, and the country?</P>
<P>An earnest desire to save, as much as possible, the time
of the committee, would also dissuade me from recurring to any points
previous to my instructions which have been discussed upon former
occasions; but I find that great stress is still laid to my prejudice
upon a paper which found its way to the house during my absence: I mean the
private letter to the noble lord, secretary for the American department,
dated 1st January, 1777.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">See Appendix No.
I.</NOTE></P>
<P>The noble Lord has frequently stated that letter to have
slipped inadvertently into the parcel destined for the house, and I give
credit in that particular to his assertion; <PB N="2" REF="9"/> because,
whatever other impressions he might have found it his interest to make
re∣specting me, he certainly would not have thought that the imputation on me
which that letter tended to fix, a proper one for <HI>him</HI> to put forward:
it is a notorious fact, or I would not mention it, that it has been held a
reflection upon my character (by the part of the public with whom the noble
lord is unpopular) that I addressed him as a patron and friend.</P>
<P>This is an imputation to which I must plead guilty; for at the
time I wrote that letter, I certainly did hold that noble lord as my friend,
and I had acted to deserve he should be so. The next ill tendency of that
paper was, as the noble lord well knows, to impress the public with an
opinion, that I was endeavouring to supplant Sir Guy Carleton in the command
of the northern army—an action abhorrent to the honour of an officer and
the liberality of a gentleman; and of which, thank God, I can prove the
falsehood, by irrefragable evidence upon your table, and in a very small
compass. I need only refer to the dispatches to Sir Guy Carleton by his aid
de-camp, dated 22d August, 1776,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">See Appendix No.
II.</NOTE> four months before I came home, to shew that it was at that time
determined, that Sir Guy Carleton should remain in Canada; and that
determination was made, as I have been informed, not only upon the political
reasoning which appears in that dispatch, but also, upon great law
opinions, that he could not, under the commission he then held under the
great seal, pass the frontiers of his province. Sir, this confutation was
urged by me last year; and were collateral proof necessary to my
justification upon this sub∣ject, I could bring to your bar a tribe of
gentlemen, who had imbibed impressions not very favourable to the military
proceedings of Sir Guy Carleton in the campaign of 1776: I could shew that I
seized numberless, indeed I seized every possible oc∣casion to
vindicate the judgment, the assiduity, the activity of that highly
respectable officer, careless how ill I paid my court, earnest to meet
every attack against his fame.</P>
<P>I beg leave also to call the attention of the committee very
particularly to one other paper, the date of which is previous to my departure
from England: it is en∣titled, "Thoughts for conducting the War from the Side
of Canada, by Lieutenant General Burgoyne."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">No.
III.</NOTE> Sir, it will be in the recollection of the committee, whe∣ther,
when the conduct of the war was under consideration last year in my
absence, it was not understood, that the plan of the northern expedition
was formed upon that paper as produced upon your table? If so, I must ask
the noble lord, why he suffer∣ed that error to prevail? The noble lord knew,
(and it was peculiarly his duty to declare it) that the two proposals, the
first of turning the expedition eventually to∣wards Connecticut; and the
second, of embarking the army in the river St. Law∣rence, in order to effect
a junction with Sir William Howe by sea, in case the attempt by land
appeared 
<Q REND="inline">"impracticable, or too hazardous,"</Q> were
erased while the paper was in his lordship's hands.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="10"/> From that paper, as it appeared without
erasures, naturally arose the conclusion, that the plan I had to execute
was completely my own; upon that paper were founded, as naturally, the doubts
which have been entertained upon the peremptory tenor of my instructions. I
must again ask the noble lord, upon what principle of justice he
suf∣fered those impressions to exist in this house? Why, in a
debate in which he took a part, did he conceal, that the circumstances in
reality were totally different from those upon which gentlemen reasoned;
that the discretion reserved in the paper be∣fore the house was taken
away, and consequently, that my orders were rendered ab∣solute in the
strictest sense by his own alterations?</P>
<P>Let any gentleman who has supposed I had an implied latitude
for my conduct, now compare this circumstance with the wording of the letter
to Sir Guy Carleton, dated March 26, 1777, with a copy of which I was
furnished, and extracts from which were afterwards the only orders I had to
act upon.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">See Appendix No. IV.</NOTE></P>
<P>I shall take no particular notice of what is called the saving
clause, in the latter part of the orders, except to give the flattest
contradiction to the supposition that I dictated it—a supposition
that I know is not yet abandoned by the men who first sug∣gested it. I
have spoke to it very fully upon a former occasion;<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The debate upon Mr. Vyner's motion, May 28, 1778; the
speech was published.</NOTE> and I do not wish, when it can be avoided,
to enforce or reiterate the charges of duplicity and treachery which must
ensue, if that clause could be supposed to have reference to any
conduct previous to my arrival at Albany. The circumstance of forbidding me
the latitude in the two particulars I had proposed in my plan, and many other
circumstances, clearly indicating the decided intentions and expectations of
the ministers, rendered the sense of the whole order taken together clear
and distinct, and shewed that the clause which is pretended to have left
me a discretion as to my main object, had no sort of relation to that
object. That clause evidently related not to my forcing my way, or not
forcing it, to Albany, the place of my destination, but to such collateral
and eventual operations as might be adviseable in the course of my march.
It related to the making impression upon the rebels, and bringing them to
obedience, in such manner as exigencies might require, and in my judgment
might seem most proper, previous to receiving orders from Sir William Howe,

<Q REND="inline">"of my junction with whom I was never to lose
view."</Q></P>
<P>Notwithstanding there has been so much discussion in
debate and print upon the interpretation of absolute orders, the committee, I
am confident, will absolve me, though, at the expence of a few moments more,
I should continue a subject upon which the merit or blame of the future
proceedings in great measure rests.</P>
<P>I do not admit the position, that there can be no case in
which an officer acting at a distance is bound at every hazard to pursue
orders, that appear absolute <HI>and decisive.</HI> <PB N="4" REF="11"/> It
is easy to conceive circumstances, which might justify a state in
hazarding an army, for the sake of facilitating great and decisive objects.
Gentlemen, conversant in military history, will recollect many examples of
this principle: upon a former occasion, I stated a supposed
case;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The case alluded to was put in a former
debate, as follows: suppose the British army that invaded Britany in
1758, had gained a complete victory over the Duke D'Aiguillon; to have marched
rapidly towards Paris, abandoning the communication with the fleet, exposing
the army possibly to great want of provision, and to the impracticability
of retreat, would certainly have been a measure consummately des∣perate
and unjustifiable, if tried upon military system; yet, will any man
say, that if that measure must evidently have produced such alarm and
confusion in the heart of France, as to have compelled the recall of her
whole force from Germany, or such part of it, as would have given
uncontrouled scope to the armies under the King of Prussia and Prince
Ferdinand, that the minister of England would not have been judicious, though
at the palpable risk of the army, as far as capture was concerned, in
ordering the ge∣neral to proceed by the most <HI>vigorous exertions,</HI> and
to force his way to Paris?</NOTE> and I now entreat leave to add a real example
of peremptory orders, which happened in the course of my own service. I
have ever re∣tained the impression, that the circumstance I am going to
relate, made upon my mind at the time; and to those few who may still
think, that in any part of my conduct, I rashly risked my peace, my
interest or my fame, to forward the wishes of others, this
prepossession may in some measure account for, and excuse my
imprudence.</P>
<P>In the campaign of 1762, in Portugal, the Count La Lippe, a name,
which, if it finds a due historian, will stand among the first in
military fame, was placed at the head of about 6000 British troops, and a
Portuguese army, the greater part of which was little better than nominal, to
defend an extensive frontier against the whole force of Spain, and a large
body of the veteran troops of France. The salvation of Por∣tugal depended
solely on the capacity of that great man, which united the deepest
political reasoning with exquisite military address.</P>
<P>I had the honour to be entrusted with the defence of the most
important pass upon the Tagus, and my orders were peremptory to maintain it
against any numbers, and to the last man.</P>
<P>A select corps of the enemy, greatly superior to mine, were
encamped within sight on the other side the river, and our advanced posts
were within half musquet shot.</P>
<P>In this situation, I received intelligence from Count La Lippe,
of a design of the enemy to pass the Tagus in force, about six miles
above me, and to take possession of the open country in my rear, with a
large corps of cavalry, by which means all com∣munication, supply, or safe
retreat, would be cut off.</P>
<P>Together with this intelligence, the Count's letter expressed,

<Q REND="inline">"That every delay to the enemy in getting
possession of the pass I guarded, was so material to his other
plans and operations, that it justified a deviation from systematic
rules; that, therefore, after taking timely precautions to secure the retreat
of my cavalry, I must abide the consequence with the infantry; that at the
last extremity, I must abandon my cannon, camp, &amp;c. and with such
provision as the men could carry <PB N="5" REF="12"/> upon their backs, throw
myself into the mountains upon my left, and endea∣vour, by small and
dispersed parties, to gain a rendezvous at the northern part of the
province."</Q> I must observe, that when these peremptory orders were
given, the commander was at a distance that made all timely communication of
cir∣cumstances as impossible, as if the Atlantic had been between us; and
I cannot close the example without mentioning the concluding part of Count La
Lippe's letter. 
<Q REND="inline">"He participated," he said, "in the feelings
with which an officer would be struck for his reputation, in suffering
himself to be cut, and reduced to sacrifice his camp, his baggage, and
twenty pieces of cannon. But <HI>be at ease,</HI>" continued that great and
generous man, "<HI>I will take the measure entirely upon myself,
persevere as I have directed, and be confident of my defence and
protection.</HI>"</Q> This was a saving clause of a nature very different
from those it is the practice in the present day to pen; and if any man
doubts the quotation, I can bring positive evidence to the truth of it
ver∣batim.</P>
<P>Thus much, Sir, I thought it incumbent upon me to state in
argument against the position that has been insisted upon, that no
orders can be worded so perempto∣rily at a distance, as not to admit of an
implied latitude, in case of unforeseen and insurmountable difficulties:
but to prevent all future cavil, upon this subject, I re∣quest the
committee to recollect, what I have again and again repeated; that I by no
means put my defence, in passing the Hudson's River, solely upon this
reasoning. On the contrary, supposing for the argument's sake, I
should concede (which I never have done, nor mean to do) to the noble Lord,
and to every other gentleman, all they can desire to assume upon implied
latitude in given cases, I should equally prove that no such case did
exist, as would have justified me upon their own principle, in de∣parting
from the letter of the orders under which I acted.</P>
<P>Having thus cleared my way to the time of my leaving England, to
take upon me the command of the Northern expedition; I shall now lay before
the committee a narrative of its progress, in as concise and simple
terms, as the nature of the subject will allow, endeavouring to imitate the
perspicuity of the honourable gentle∣man who took the lead in this
business, and not without hope of my endeavours pro∣ducing the same
effect; and that, in the opinion of the house, my language, as has been
expressed of his, will be deemed the language of truth.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 TYPE="narrative">
<PB N="6" REF="13"/>
<HEAD>NARRATIVE.</HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">NARRA∣TIVE.</NOTE>IT is my intention, for the
more ready comprehension of the whole subject, to divide it into three
periods. The first, from my appointment to the command, to the end of my
pursuit of the enemy from Ticonderoga; the second, from that time to the
passage of the Hudson's River; and the third to the signing the
convention.</P>
<P>I left London on the 27th of March, and upon my departure from
Plymouth, finding the Albion man of war ready to sail for New-York, I wrote
to Sir W. Howe by that conveyance, upon the subject of my expedition, and the
nature of my orders. I arrived at Quebec the 6th of May. Sir Guy Carleton
immediately put under my command the troops destined for the expedition, and
committed to my management the preparatory arrangements. From thence I wrote a
second letter to Sir William Howe, wherein I repeated that I was entrusted
with the command of the army destined to march from Canada, and that my
orders were to force a junction with his excellency.</P>
<P>I expressed also my wishes, 
<Q REND="inline">"that a latitude had been left me for a
diversion to∣wards Connecticut, but that such an idea being out of
question, by my orders being precise to force the junction, it was only
mentioned to introduce the idea still resting upon my mind; viz. to give
the change to the enemy if I could, and by every feint in my power to
establish a suspicion, that I still pointed towards
Connecticut."</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">"But," I repeated, "that under the present
precision of my orders, I should really have no view but that of joining
him, nor think myself justified by any temp∣tation to delay the most
expeditious means I could find to effect that purpose."</Q></P>
<P>I proceeded to Montreal on the 12th, and as my letters, lately
laid before the house from that place,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">See Appendix
No. V.</NOTE> and from Quebec, will shew the state of things, I should
not rest a moment upon this period, were it not to add one more public
testimony, to those I am not conscious of having omitted upon any
occasion, of the assiduous and cordial manner in which the different
services were forwarded by Sir Guy Carleton. I should think it as
dishonourable to seek, as I know it would be impossible to find
excuse for any fault of mine in any failure on the part of Sir Guy Carleton,
or of any per∣sons who acted under him, in any matter respecting the
expedition. Had that officer been acting for himself, or for his brother, he
could not have shewn more indefatigable zeal than he did, to comply with and
expedite my requisitions and desires.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="14"/> Certain parts of the expected force,
nevertheless, fell short. The Canadian troops, stated in the plan at
2000, consisted only of three companies, intended to be of 100 men each,
but in reality not amounting to more than 150 upon the whole; nor could they be
augmented. The corvées, which are detachments of provincials without
arms, to repair roads, convey provisions, or any other temporary employ∣ments
for the king's service, could not be obtained in sufficient number, nor
kept to their employments, although Sir Guy Carleton used every possible
exertion and en∣couragement for the purpose. Drivers for the provision
carts, and other carriages, could not be fully supplied by the contractor,
though no expence was spared; a circumstance which occasioned much
inconvenience afterwards.</P>
<P>To these unavoidable disappointments were added the
difficulties occasioned by bad weather, which rendered the roads almost
impracticable at the carrying places, and consequently the passage of the
batteaux, artillery, and baggage exceedingly dilatory: we had besides a great
deal of contrary wind. Notwithstanding all impediments the army assembled
between the 17th and 20th of June, at Cumberland Point, upon Lake
Champlain.</P>
<P>On the 21st I held a conference with the Iroquois, Algonchins,
Abenekies, and Outawas, Indians, in all about four hundred.</P>
<P>This conference appears in your papers<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">See
Appendix No. VI.</NOTE>. I thought at the time that the cordiality of the
Indians over the whole continent might be depended upon, and their first
operations tended to persuade me into a belief of their utility. The priest
to whom they seemed devoted, and the British officers employed to conduct
them, and to whose controul they engaged to submit, gained advantages, and
spread terror without bar∣barity. The first party sent out made several
of the enemy prisoners in the heat of action, and treated them with European
humanity.</P>
<P>During the movement of the different corps to this general
rendezvous, I wrote a third letter to Sir William Howe. The chief purport of it
was to give him 
<Q REND="inline">"intelli∣gence of my situation at the time, and
of my expectation of being before Ticonderoga between the 20th and 25th
instant; that I did not apprehend the effective strength of the army would
amount to above 6500 men; that I meant to apply to Sir Guy Carleton to send a
garrison to Ticonderoga when it should be reduced, but that I was
apprehensive he would not think himself authorised by the King's orders
to comply; that whenever, therefore, I might be able to effect the junction,
Sir William would not expect me to bring near the original number. I repeated
my perseverance in the idea of giving jealousy on the side of
Connecticut, and at the same time my assurances, that I should make no
manoeuvre that could procrastinate the great object of a junction."</Q></P>
<P>I state these different letters to Sir William Howe merely to
shew that my concep∣tion of the precision of my orders was not upon
after-thought, and taken up as an <PB N="8" REF="15"/> excuse when I found the
expedition had failed; but a fixed decided sentiment coeval with my knowledge
of my command.</P>
<P>For a further proof of the same fact, I beg leave to state an
extract from my orders to the army at Crown Point, June 30th. The words were
these.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">"The army embarks to-morrow to approach the enemy.
The services required of this particular expedition are critical and
conspicuous. During our progress oc∣casions may occur, in which, nor
difficulty, nor labour, nor life are to be regarded. This army must not
retreat."</Q> Were it necessary, I could bring abundant collateral proof to
the same effect, and shew that the idea of forcing a way to Albany by
vi∣gorous exertions against any opposition we might meet, was general and
fixt through the whole army.</P>
<P>My proceedings from the time of assembling the army as before
described, to the date of my public dispatch from Skenesborough,
comprehending the manoeuvres which forced the enemy from Ticondenoga, and the
actions at Skenesborough, Hu∣berton, and Fort Anne, are related at full in
that dispatch.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">See Appendix No. VII.</NOTE></P>
<P>It is the less necessary to give the Committee further
trouble upon this subject, be∣cause I believe no enemy can be found to
arraign my conduct in those days of suc∣cess; or if there were one, he
could not deprive me of the consolation, that I had his Majesty's full
approbation and applause, of which it is known to many, I had a very
honourable and distinguished proof.</P>
<P>All therefore that is necessary before I quit this first
period of the campaign, is to give a precise state of the effective
strength of the army, at the time it assembled.</P>
<P>On the 1st July, the day we encamped before Ticonderoga, the
troops consisted of 
<TABLE>

</TABLE></P>
<P>In regard to the artillery, I think this the proper place to
rectify the misrepresenta∣tions that have prevailed respecting the
quantity employed. It has been stated as far beyond the necessary
proportion for the number of troops, an incumbrance to their movements, and one
cause of what has been called the slow progress of the expedition.</P>
<P>In order to justify this charge, a view of the whole mass has
been presented to the public without any explanation of its distinct
allotments; and many have been led to believe, that the whole was attached to
the army throughout the campaign, and <PB N="9" REF="16"/> fell into the enemy's
hands at last—The intention of this representation is obvious: the
allegation is false.</P>
<P>The facts, as I shall prove them to the committee, are as
follow. The whole origi∣nal train furnished by Sir Guy Carleton consisted
of sixteen heavy twenty-four poun∣ders; ten heavy twelve-pounders; eight
medium twelve-pounders; two light twenty-four pounders; one light
twelve-pounder; twenty-six light six pounders; seventeen light
three-pounders; six eight-inch howitzers; six five and a half inch
howitzers; two thirteen-inch mortars; two ten-inch mortars; six eight-inch
mortars; twelve five and a half-inch mortars; and twenty-four four and two
fifth-inch mortars. Of these two heavy twenty-four pounders were sent on
board a ship for the defence of Lake Champlain, and the other fourteen were
sent back to St. John's. Of the heavy twelve-pounders, six were left at
Ticonderoga, four ditto in the Royal George; four medium twelve-pounders at
Fort George; one light twelve-pounder at Ticonderoga; two light six-pounders
at Fort George; four light six-pounders at St. John's; four light
three-pounders at Ticonderoga; five light three-pounders at St. John's; two
eight-inch howitzers at Fort George; two ditto at St. John's; two five and a
half inch ho∣witzers at Fort George; two thirteen-inch mortars in the Royal
George; two ten-inch mortars in ditto; four eight-inch mortars in ditto; four
five and a half inch mortars at Ticonderoga; four royal mortars in the Royal
George; twelve cohorns at Ticon∣deroga; and eight cohorns in the Royal
George.</P>
<P>The field-train therefore that proceeded with the army
consisted of four medium twelve-pounders; two light twenty-four pounders;
eighteen light six-pounders; six light three-pounders; two eight-inch
howitzers; four five and a half-inch howitzers; two eight-inch mortars, and
four royals.</P>
<P>The carrying the twenty-four pounders (though they were but two)
has been spoken of as an error, and it is necessary therefore to inform
the committee that they were of a construction lighter by 800 weight than
medium twelves, and to all intents and purposes field artillery.</P>
<P>This artillery was distributed as follows. 
<LIST>
<ITEM>Fraser's corps, estimated at three battalions. Ten
pieces, viz. 
<LIST>
<ITEM>Four light six-pounders.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Four light three-pounders, constructed for being
occasionally carried on horseback.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Two royal howitzers.</ITEM>
</LIST></ITEM>
<ITEM>German reserve, under Colonel Breyman, estimated at two
battalions. 
<LIST>
<ITEM>Two light six-pounders.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Two light three-pounders, and served by the Hesse
Hanau artillery men.</ITEM>
</LIST></ITEM>
<ITEM>The line of British, four battalions</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="10" REF="17"/>Germans, five battalions.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Total, nine battalions.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>Three brigades of artillery, of four six-pounders each; viz. one
brigade for each wing, and one for the center.</P>
<P>From hence it appears that to fourteen battalions there were
allotted twenty-six pieces of light artillery. The customary allotment is
two pieces per battalion, con∣sequently the proportion of artillery was
less than upon common services.</P>
<P>The forming artillery into brigades, in preference to detaching
two guns to each bat∣talion, has been constantly practised in most
services during last war under the ablest men, and it is productive of
many advantages, as the brigades by that means, either singly or united, fall
under the command of a proportionable number of officers. The service is
carried on with greater regularity, and the effect of the fire becomes much
more formidable than when scattered along the front of the line.</P>
<P>This mode of service was recommended by Major-general Phillips,
and adopted without hesitation by me, my own judgment being confirmed by an
officer of his great skill and experience.</P>
<P>The park artillery consisted of ten pieces, viz. 
<LIST>
<ITEM>2 light twenty-four pounders.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4 medium twelve-pounders.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2 eight-inch howitzers.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2 royal howitzers.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>I understood this proportion of field artillery to be the same
as that proposed by Sir Guy Carleton had he commanded; it was the proportion
recommended by General Phillips, and I formed my opinion conformably to the
sentiments of those respectable officers upon the following reasons,
viz. that artillery was extremely for∣midable to raw troops; that in a country
of posts it was essentially necessary against the best troops;
that it was yet more applicable to the enemy we were to combat, because the
mode of defence they invariably adopted, and at which they were be∣yond all
other nations expert, was that of entrenchment covered with strong abbatis,
against which the cannon, of the nature of the heaviest above described,
and howit∣zers might often be effectual, when to dislodge them by any other
means might be attended with continued and important losses.</P>
<P>In these general ideas of the use of artillery against the
rebel forces, I have the happiness to observe, from the papers before you,
the concurrence of Sir William Howe, who states similar ideas very fully in
one of his requisitions to the secretary of state: but further reasons
for not diminishing the proportion of guns of superior calibre to
six-pounders in this train, were, first, their use against
block-houses (a species of fortification peculiar to America); secondly,
a probability that gun-boats might be requisite for the security of the
water transport, on some parts of the <PB N="11" REF="18"/> Hudson's
River; but principally the intention of fortifying a camp at Albany, in case
I should reach that place, should meet with a sufficiency of provision
there, (as I was led to expect) and should find it expedient to pass the
winter there, without communication with New-York.</P>
<P>With respect to the quantity of ammunition attached to this
artillery, it is to be observed, that the number of rounds accompanying the
light pieces, and which were carried in small carts, were not more than
sufficient for a day's action. 
<TABLE>

<P>The different reserves of ammunition were chiefly conveyed by
water in scows and batteaux; it certainly would not have been advisable,
after a communica∣tion with Canada was at an end, to depend upon precarious
supplies from the south∣ward, and therefore it became necessary (as far
as the service would allow) to carry forward such stores, as there was
every appearance of an absolute want of, during the course of an active
campaign.</P>
<P>Had the enemy established themselves in force upon the
islands at the mouth of the Mohawk river, or on other ground equally
advantageous, to have disputed the passage of that, or of the Hudson's
River, or had they even waited an assault in their works at Still-Water, it
is probable, that recourse must have been had to artillery of the heavier
nature; in the latter case especially they must have been used in order
to derive any advantage from our seizing a post upon their left flank: I
have since known, that they had iron twelve and nine-pounders mounted upon
those works, which were in other respects very formidable.

<P>Add these numbers to the former state of the army, and it will
be found, that the regular strength when at the greatest consisted of
7213.</P>
<P>I come now to the second period of the campaign, comprehending
the transactions from the time the pursuit of the enemy from Ticonderoga
ceased, and the corps of Brigadier-general Fraser, and the 9th regiment,
rejoined the army, after the respec∣tive actions of Huberton and Fort Anne,
to the time when the army passed the Hud∣son's river to attack the enemy
near Still-Water.</P>
<P>It had proved impossible immediately to follow the quick
retreat of the enemy farther, from the nature of the country, and the
necessity of waiting a fresh supply <PB N="12" REF="19"/> of
provisions. But it appeared evident to me, that could a rapid progress
towards Albany be effected, during their dispersion and panic, it would be
decisive on the success of the expedition.</P>
<P>Question has been made by those who began at this period to
arraign my military conduct, whether it would not have been more expedient for
the purpose of rapidity, to have fallen back to Ticonderoga, in order to take
the convenient route by Lake George, than to have persevered in the laborious
and difficult course by land to Fort Edward? My motives for preferring the
latter were these: I considered not only the general impressions which
a retrograde motion is apt to make upon the minds both of enemies and friends,
but also, that the natural conduct of the enemy in that case would be to
remain at Fort George, as their retreat could not then be cut off, in order to
oblige me to open trenches, and consequently to delay me, and in the mean
time they would have destroyed the road from Fort George to Fort Ed∣ward. On
the other hand, by persisting to penetrate by the short cut from Fort
Anne, of which I was then master, to Fort Edward, though it was attended with
great labour, and many alert situations, the troops were improved in the very
essen∣tial point of wood service; I effectually dislodged the enemy
from Fort George without a blow; and seeing me master of one communication,
they did not think it worth while to destroy the other.</P>
<P>The great number of boats also, which must necessarily
have been employed for the transport of the troops over Lake George, were by
this course spared for the transport of the provision, artillery, and
ammunition.</P>
<P>The success answered this reasoning in every point; for by
the vigilance of Gene∣neral Phillips, to whom I had committed the important
part of forwarding all the ne∣cessaries from Ticonderoga, a great
embarkation arrived at Fort George on July 29th. I took possession of
the country near Fort Edward on the same day, and independently of other
advantages, I found myself much more forward in point of time than I could
possibly have been by the other route.</P>
<P>Another material motive, which could not be known by strangers
who have rea∣soned upon this movement, was, that during the time that my army
was employed in clearing Wood-Creek and cutting roads, and the corps under
Major-general Phillips working to pass the transports over Lake George, I
was enabled to detach a large corps to my left, under Major-general Reidesel,
and thereby assist my pur∣pose of giving jealousy to Connecticut, and
keeping in check the whole country called the Hampshire Grants.</P>
<P>It was at this time Major-general Reidesel conceived the
purpose of mounting his regiment of dragoons. In the country he traversed
during his detached command, he found the people frightened and
submissive. He was industrious and expert in <PB N="13" REF="20"/>
procuring intelligence in parts of the country more remote than Bennington, and
entertained no doubt of success, were an expedition formed under the
command of Lieutenant-colonel Baum.</P>
<P>On the arrival of the army at Fort Edward, the great object of
attention was the transports from Fort George. The distance was about
sixteen miles, the roads wanting great repair, the weather unfavourable, the
cattle and carriages scarce; part of the latter inconvenience was
occasioned by the number of both that were necessarily detained at
Ticonderoga, for the purpose of dragging the boats and the provisions over
the carrying places, between Lake Champlain and Lake George; another part of
the inconvenience was caused by the unavoidable delays, in bringing the
different divisions of horses as they were collected in Canada through the
desart, for such most of the country is between St. John's and
Ticonderoga.</P>
<P>It was soon found, that in the situation of the transport
service at that time, the army could barely be victualled from day to day,
and that there was no prospect of establishing a magazine in due time for
pursuing present advantages. The idea of the expedition to Bennington
originated upon this difficulty, combined with the in∣telligence reported by
General Reidesel, and with all I had otherwise received.</P>
<P>I knew that Bennington was the great deposit of corn, flour, and
store cattle; that it was guarded only by militia; and every day's account
tended to confirm the persuasion of the loyalty of one description of the
inhabitants and the panic of the other. Those who knew the country best
were the most sanguine in this per∣suasion.</P>
<P>Had my intelligence been worse founded, I should not have
hesitated to try this ex∣pedition with such troops, and under such
instructions as I gave to the commanding officer, for so great a purpose
as that of a supply sufficient to enable the army to follow at the heels of
a broken and disconcerted enemy. The German troops employed were of the
best I had of that nation. The number of British was small; but it was
the select light corps of the army, composed of chosen men from all the
regiments, and commanded by Captain Fraser, one of the most
distinguished officers in his line of ser∣vice that ever I met with. The
instructions recommended the utmost caution respect∣ing posts and
security of retreat, attention against exposing the solid part of the
detach∣ment to affront, or committing it in any instance, without a moral
certainty of success. I touch with tenderness and with great reluctance
points that relate to the dead. My defence compels me to say, my cautions
were not observed, nor the reinforcement ad∣vanced with the alacrity I had a
right to expect. The men who commanded in both instances were brave and
experienced officers. I have ever imputed their failure partly to delusion in
respect to the enemy, and partly to surprise and consequent confusion
in the troops.</P>
<P>For further explanation of my motives, and the circumstances
attending the con∣duct <PB N="14" REF="21"/> of the expedition, I beg leave to
refer the committee to the letter laid before the house last year, and more
particularly to the private letter laid before the house lately.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">See Appendix No. VIII.</NOTE></P>
<P>The same letter will shew the only resource that remained
for proceeding towards Albany, after the disappointment of this expedition,
viz. to press forward a necessary supply of provision, and other
indispensible articles, from Fort George. I shall bring proof to your bar
to this point, and I trust I shall shew beyond a doubt, that no
pos∣sible exertion was omitted. It is not uncommon for gentlemen,
unacquainted with the peculiarities of the country to which I am alluding, to
calculate the transport of magazines, by measuring the distance upon a
map, and then applying the resources of carriage, as practised in other
countries. I request permission to shew their mistake. The first
stage from Fort George to Fort Edward is by land. The distance and the
roads were described before. At Fort Edward the Hudson's River becomes
navigable for a certain extent, and it is the constant practice in all
transports to resume the water carriage. Were it not, new impediments would
arise from hills, worse roads, and such an increased distance, as
would prevent the cattle returning to Fort George the same day. About six
miles below Fort Edward lie the falls of Fort Miller, where there is another
carrying-place, which, though of no considerable length, makes it
necessary to unload the boats, to place the contents in carts, and to
replace them in fresh boats, at the place the river again admits of
navigation. The boats unloaded, return to Fort Edward against a rapid
stream.</P>
<P>Upon this short state of facts, gentlemen will judge of our
embarrassments. In the first place, it was necessary to bring forward
to Fort Edward fourscore or a hun∣dred boats, as mere carriage-vessels
for the provisions, each boat made a hard day's work for six or more
horses, including the return of the horses. At the next carry∣ing-place, as
above described, it was necessary to place a considerable relay of
horses to draw over, first, a portion of carriage boats, and afterwards the
provision, as it arrived. I have not mentioned the great number of other
boats necessary to be brought forward, to form bridges, to carry baggage
and ammunition, and the num∣ber of carriages framed to transport the boats
themselves at the ensuing carrying-places, as we should proceed to
Albany. This will be shewn in detail at the bar, if the committee chuse to
hear it; and I pledge myself, it will appear, that the dili∣gence in this
service was extreme; that it was performed in the most expeditious manner
possible, regard being had to our resources, and that no delay was
occasioned by the artillery, because the horses appropriated to it were
supernumerary to those for which we had carts, and the artillery, not
already with the army, at last was all brought up by its own horses in two
days.</P>
<P>On the 13th of September, the store of provision, amounting to
about thirty day's consumption, was completed. I have stated, in my letter
to the secretary of state, my reasons against proceeding with less
quantity. And it is now time to enter upon <PB N="15" REF="22"/> the
consideration of that object, which is held by some to be conclusive upon
the executive part of the campaign, the passage of the Hudson's
River.</P>
<P>Two errors, respecting this passage, though of opposite
and incompatible natures, are supposed to have contributed to the ill
success that ensued; the one, the error of delay, the other, that of
precipitation. In defence against the first, I refer to my effort at
Bennington to procure supplies, and to the impediments, I have just now
stated, after that effort failed. Against the latter, I refer to the
reasons laid down in my private letter to the secretary of state, dated
20th of August. 
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">See Appendix No. IX.</NOTE>The state of
things at this important crisis, and my reasoning upon it, are
expressed still more at large in my dispatch from Albany; I will now
only touch them shortly. On the one hand, my communications were at an end;
my retreat was insecure; the enemy was collected in force; they were
strongly posted; Colonel St. Leger was retiring from Fort Stanwix. These
were difficulties, but none of them insurmountable. On the other hand, I had
dislodged the enemy repeatedly, when before in force, and more strongly
posted; my army was conscious of having the superiority, and eager to
advance; I expected co-operation; no letters from Sir William Howe removed that
expectation; that to Sir Guy Carleton had never weighed upon my mind, because
it was dated early in April, and consequently long before the secretary of
state's instructions, which I must have supposed to relate to
co-ope∣ration, could be received. The letter of 17th July,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">No. X.</NOTE> mentioned that General's re∣turn to my
assistance, should Washington turn his force towards me; indicated,
as I thought, an expectation of my arrival at Albany; and informed me, that Sir
Henry Clinton was left at New-York, and would act as occurrences might direct.
I did <HI>not</HI> know Sir Henry Clinton's force. I <HI>did</HI> know, that
considerable reinforcement might be then expected at New-York from England.
After all, should co-opera∣tion from below fail, the whole force of Colonel
St. Leger, and Sir William John∣son, was to be expected from above, in time
to facilitate a retreat, though not in time to assist my advance. Under
these different suggestions, and those that are more copiously
stated in the dispatch, to which I have referred, I read again my orders (I
believe for an hundredth time) and I was decided.</P>
<P>And I am still convinced, that no proof that could have been
brought from ap∣pearances, intelligence or reasoning, could have justified
me to my country, have saved me from the condemnation of my profession,
or produced pardon within my own breast, had I not advanced, and tried a
battle with the enemy.</P>
<P>I will conclude this subject, with again asserting upon my
honour, what I hope to support by evidence, though it is impossible to
bring positive proof to a nega∣tive, that neither General Fraser, nor
General Phillips, ever offered, as has been re∣ported, nor can be supposed
to have conceived any objection against the passage of the Hudson's
River.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="23"/> This resolution being taken, I trust, the
manner of approaching the enemy, when explained by witnesses, will not be
disgraceful to me as a soldier. The action, which ensued on the 19th of
September, verified my opinion of the valour of my army; and I must, in
truth, acknowledge, a very respectable share of that quality in the army of
the enemy. To the general description given in my dispatch, it will be fit
to add, by evidence, the peculiar merits of the troops in that action. The
ho∣nour of three British regiments, in continual and close fire for four
hours, all of them suffering considerable loss, and one remaining with
less than sixty men, and four or five officers, ought not to lose its due
applause, because it is said, their opponents were irregulars and
militia.</P>
<P>A victory was at last obtained, but the close of day
unavoidably prevented any immediate advantages. On the day following, it was
known from prisoners and de∣serters, that the enemy were in a post
strongly fortified; but from the thickness of the wood, it was
impossible to catch a view of any part of their position. All that could
be done, therefore, was to take up ground as near them, as the nature of the
country would admit with regard to military arrangement. It appears from the
dis∣patch already alluded to, that the army remained in this position till
the 9th of Octo∣ber, when the second action ensued, employed in fortifying
their camp, and watch∣ing the enemy, whose numbers it was now known, had been
greatly superior to ours in the action.</P>
<P>It may here be asked, why, as soon as it became palpable that
no use could be made of the victory, I did not retreat?</P>
<P>It will be shewn, that on the second day after the action, I
received intelligence from Sir Henry Clinton, of his intention to attack the
highlands about that time, and I was hourly in expectation, I thought a
justly founded one, of that measure operating to dislodge Mr. Gates
entirely, or to oblige him to detach a large portion of his force. Either of
these cases would probably have opened my way to Albany. In these
circumstances, could the preference upon these alternatives admit of a
mo∣ment's reflection? To wait so fair a prospect of effecting at last the
great purpose of the campaign, or to put a victorious army, under all the
disadvantages of a beat∣en one, by a difficult and disgraceful retreat;
relinquishing the long expected co-operation, in the very hour of its
promise, and leaving Sir Henry Clinton's army, and probably Sir William
Howe's, exposed, with so much of the season of the cam∣paign to run, to
the whole force of Mr. Gates, after he should have seen me on the other
side of Hudson's River.</P>
<P>Some of the same considerations, and other concomitant
circumstances, will, in part, serve to account for my not attacking the
enemy during this interval; for in this situation, as in former ones, my
conduct has been arraigned upon opposite principles.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="24"/> The committee will observe, that after
receiving intelligence of Sir Henry Clinton's design, different
messengers were dispatched by different routes, to inform that officer of
my situation, and of the time I thought I could continue in it. To have
hazarded a repulse, under so reasonable an expectation of a powerful
diversion, would, in my opinion, have been very unjustifiable; but when I
add, that from the backwardness, or defection, of the few Indians that
remained, the numbers of rifle-men, and other irregulars employed on the
enemy's out-posts, and the strength and darkness of the surrounding
woods, it had not yet been practicable to gain any competent knowledge of their
position, I trust every man will go with me in the sentiment, that all
these circumstances considered, an attack would have been consummate
rashness.</P>
<P>Another very powerful reason, that operated on the side of
delay, was the state of my sick and wounded. Numbers of the latter were
recovering fast; many excellent officers in particular; and the more I
delayed the stronger I grew. The time also en∣titled me to expect
Lieutenant Colonel St. Leger's corps would be arrived at Ticon∣deroga, and
secret means had been long concerted to enable him to make an effort to join
me, with probability of success.</P>
<P>Upon mature consideration of these and other circumstances
attending this period, come to my knowledge since, I am clearly of opinion,
that had the reinforcements from England arrived in time, to have enabled Sir
Henry Clinton to have effected the stroke he afterwards so gallantly made
in the highlands, any time between the two actions, I should have made my
way.</P>
<P>The dispatch alluded to, proceeds to state the reason that
induced me to make the movement on the 7th October. I shall only add, to
obviate a supposed error, in not advancing my whole line, that the part
remaining in my camp, operated as effectually to keep the enemy's right wing in
check, from supporting their left, as if it had moved, with this additional
advantage, that it prevented the danger of their ad∣vancing by the plain, near
the river, and falling upon my rear.</P>
<P>I have reason to believe my disappointment on that day
proceeded from an uncom∣mon circumstance in the conduct of the enemy. Mr.
Gates, as I have been informed, had determined to receive the attack in his
lines; Mr. Arnold, who commanded on the left, forseeing the danger of being
turned, advanced without consultation with his ge∣neral, and gave, instead
of receiving battle. The stroke might have been fatal on his part had he
failed. But confident I am, upon minute examination of the ground since, that
had the other idea been pursued, I should in a few hours have gained a
po∣sition, that in spite of the enemy's numbers, would have put them in my
power.</P>
<P>Disagreeable as is the necessity, I must here again, in
justice to my own army, recur to the vigour and obstinacy with which they
were fought by the enemy. A more deter∣mined perseverance than they shewed
in the attack upon the lines, though they were <PB N="18" REF="25"/> finally
repulsed by the corps under Lord Balcarras, I believe, is not in any
officer's experience. It will be the business of evidence to prove, that in
the part, where Co∣lonel Breyman was killed, and the enemy penetrated, the
mischief could not be re∣paired, nor under it the camp be longer tenable.</P>
<P>The transactions of the ensuing night, the day of the eighth,
and the whole progress of the retreat to Saratoga, will be laid before the
committee minutely in the course of my evidence, as well as every
circumstance, from the time the army arrived there to the signing the
convention. I have only to premise, that, I trust, I shall be able to
prove, to the satisfaction of the committee, that even in this situation, I
had the chance of a favourable event. The enemy had intended to attack by the
plain of Saratoga. On the morning of the 11th, a considerable column had
actually passed the Fish Kill for that purpose during the fog, which at
that season was regular till sometime after sun rise. The intention
was prevented taking place, by intelligence one of their generals received from
a deserter, that I had a line formed behind the brush-wood, to support
the post of artillery, which was their immediate object of attack. The
general in∣stantly retreated his column, and prevented a general action,
which my position, com∣pared with the proposed one of the enemy, gave me
reason to hope would have been to my advantage.</P>
<P>I have likewise a satisfactory confidence, that I shall
demonstrate that the intelligence I stated to the councils of war,
respecting the strength of the enemy, did not fall short in any part, and
in some parts much exceeded my own belief, particularly on the only
possible routes of my retreat; and that those posts were not taken up
during my stay at Saratoga, as has been reported, but some of them previous
to the action of the 7th, and the rest immediately after it.</P>
<P>I shall close the whole of this by delivering at your table,
from the hands of my secre∣tary, an authenticated return of the force of
General Gates, signed by himself, and the truth of it will be supported
from ocular testimony, by every officer of the British army. Many of them
are now in England, and after what has been insinuated, not to say charged
in this House, it becomes the duty of the accusers, not only to examine
closely the officers I have called, but to produce any other witnesses,
that in their thoughts may be qualified to speak to the good or bad order of
the rebel troops, when they marched by in their presence, and to their
behaviour, when opposed to our troops in action.</P>
<P>I cannot close this long trespass upon the patience of the
committee, without ex∣pressing one humble hope, that in forming a judgment
upon the whole, or any distinct part of these transactions, they will be
considered as they must have appeared at the time; for, I believe, where
war is concerned, few men in command would stand ac∣quitted, 
<PB N="19" REF="26"/> if any after-knowledge of facts and circumstances were
brought in argument against decisions of the moment, and apparent
exigencies of the occasion.</P>
<P>I submit all I have said, some of it, I fear, not
sufficiently prepared or arranged, with true respect to the committee. I
shall not mention <HI>all</HI> the disadvantages, under which I have
pressed this business upon their attention. I have cause to regret
the ab∣sence of a most confidential friend in Major General Phillips;
zealous advocates, I trust, in Major General Reidesel and Brigadier
Hamilton. Much of my vindication is in the grave with General Fraser; much
with Colonel Ackland your late member. I trust my zeal, in promoting this
enquiry, as I have done, will be one mark of the sense I bear of the
general character of this house; that however men may be biassed by
political attachments upon common occasions, when the honour of an individual
is committed to their hands, they will alone be guided by truth and justice.
And the next inference I should wish to be drawn, from my earnestness
for a public appeal, is this; that however others may impute errors to my
conduct, I am myself conscious of the rectitude of my intentions.</P>

<HEAD>Committee to consider of the several Papers which were
presented to the House by Mr. De Grey, upon the 19th Day of March last,
pursuant to their Address to his Majesty.</HEAD>
<P>Mr. F. Montagu in the Chair.</P>
<P>SIR GUY CARLETON was called in and examined by General Burgoyne
as follows: 
<Q> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">1.</NOTE>Q. DO you recollect having received
a letter from the secretary of state, mention∣ing the reasons that made
it expedient for you to remain in the province of Quebec?</P> 
<P>A. Yes, very well.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">2.</NOTE>Q. What was the date of it?</P> 
<P>A. I think the 12th of August, 1776—I am sure it was
in August.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">3.</NOTE>Q. Was not the date of that letter
long before the return of General Burgoyne from Canada to Great Britain?</P> 
<P>A. Yes.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">4.</NOTE>Q. During the winter, preceding the
campaign of 1777, was not the artillery pre∣pared at Montreal for field
service, upon the supposition that you was to command the army beyond the
frontiers of the province?</P> 
<P>A. It was.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">5.</NOTE>Q. Was the proportion allotted to
General Burgoyne for field service more than was intended, had you so
commanded?</P> 
<P>A. I don't precisely recollect that—It does not strike
me there was any great dif∣ference.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">6.</NOTE>Q. Was the quantity of artillery
decided on in concert with Major-General Phillips, and on his
recommendation?</P> 
<P>A. The artillery I had prepared for the campaign, on a
supposition I was to go my∣self, was in concert with General Phillips.
That department, as well as others, was put under the command of General
Burgoyne on his arrival; and, I suppose, he fol∣lowed the same method
so far as regarded the artillery.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">7.</NOTE>Q. Did General Burgoyne apply to you
for troops from Canada to garrison Ticon∣deroga when he advanced?</P> 
<P>A. He did.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">8.</NOTE>Q. What was the purport of your
answer?</P> 
<P>A. That I did not think myself justified to grant it by my
orders—My answer will appear more precisely by a copy of my answer
to General Burgoyne.</P> 
<P><PB N="21" REF="28"/><NOTE PLACE="marg">9.</NOTE>Q. Do you
recollect that General Burgoyne informed you of the motives on which he
proceeded from Skenesborough to Fort Edward by land in preference to the
route by Ticonderoga and Lake George?</P> 
<P>A. I do.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">10.</NOTE>Q. Did you concur in his
sentiments? </P> 
<P>A. I remember my answer was an answer of approbation.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">11.</NOTE>Q. Do you know of any
circumstance of General Burgoyne's military conduct, while under your
command, that you disapproved?</P> 
<P>A. I had no reason to disapprove of any part of his conduct
while under my com∣mand.</P></Q><STAGE>[Withdrew.</STAGE></P>
<P><HI>Again called in, and examined by other Members of the
Committee.</HI> 
<Q> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">12.</NOTE>Q. Whether, when you proposed to
take that train of artillery with you that you have mentioned, it was with a
view to the reduction of the forts at Ticonderoga; or whether you proposed to
have taken with you the same train of artillery in case you had marched
forward in the country toward Albany?</P> 
<P>A. It was with an intention to reduce the forts and lines at
Ticonderoga; the train of artillery was calculated for that service.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">13. By Gen. Burgoyne.</NOTE>Q. Whether you
know what proportion of artillery was carried forward by the ar∣my under
General Burgoyne's command after the reduction of Ticonderoga?</P> 
<P>A. I don't recollect.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">14.</NOTE>Q. Would you not, in case you had
reduced Ticonderoga and marched forwards towards Albany, have carried with you
a train of field artillery?</P> 
<P>A. I probably should have taken artillery with me.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">15.</NOTE>Q. Had you foreseen a
necessity of fortifying a camp at Albany, would you not have carried some
guns of the calibre of twelve pounders and light twenty-fours?</P> 
<P>A. It is really a very difficult matter off hand to run into all
the minute operations of a campaign; every measure of that sort must have
been a matter of consideration and deliberation, and there are a thousand
circumstances that might have determined me upon the spot—I don't
wish to conceal from this House any thing that I would have done—but
I hope they will consider, that every gentleman may have different ideas of
the state and situation of the army, as expressed by the question
asked, and the least inaccuracy of expression on my part may convey
ideas very different from what I could wish—In general, so
considerable a corps as that was, very seldom moves without artillery, but
the precise number must depend on a variety of circumstances, which the
discretion and judgment of the officer who commands must determine.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">16.</NOTE>Q. Were not the orders you received
from government positive, for General Bur∣goyne to march to Albany?</P> 
<P>A. The orders have been published I understand—Every
gentleman in this House must be a judge of those orders whether they were
positive or not.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">17.</NOTE>Q. Did you not receive a letter,
dated the 5th of April, from Sir William Howe, informing you that he could not
send any force to assist the operations of General Burgoyne's army?</P>

<P>A. I received a letter from Sir William Howe relative to his
operations, a copy of which was sent to General Burgoyne—I think it was
not just in those terms, but a copy of the letter is on the table.</P> 
<P><PB N="22" REF="29"/><NOTE PLACE="marg">18.</NOTE>Q. Whether on
that information, you considered that you had any discretionary power to
detain General Burgoyne after that information?</P> 
<P>A. Certainly not.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">19.</NOTE>Q. Whether in case of any
difficulty that General Burgoyne might meet with on his march, there was any
latitude given to him (General Burgoyne) to retreat?</P> 
<P>A. I said before, that the orders were before the House, who
are competent to judge on that point.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">20.</NOTE>Q. Did you yourself understand
those orders to General Burgoyne to be positive?</P> 
<P>A. That is giving an opinion upon what perhaps may be a
question in the House; whereas I have already said, the House are as
competent to judge as I am.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">21.</NOTE>Q. Is the Committee to understand
from that answer, that you have any objection of giving your opinion on that
question?</P> 
<P>A. I have an objection to give an opinion on almost all
points.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">22.</NOTE>Q. Did you give it in orders to
General Burgoyne, in case he met with any diffi∣culties during his march in
Canada, under your command, not to proceed?</P> 
<P>A. I should have taken care that General Burgoyne met with no
difficulties in his march in Canada; nor do I well see how he could.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">23.</NOTE>Q. Where do the boundaries of the
province of Canada end?</P> 
<P>A. Between the Illinois and Point an Fer.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">24.</NOTE>Q. Is the fortress of Ticonderoga
in Canada?</P> 
<P>A. No.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">25.</NOTE>Q. Did your commission, as
commander in chief of the troops in the northern division, extend beyond the
boundaries of Canada to Ticonderoga?</P> 
<P>A. That commission as commander in chief, I understood,
did extend so far; but by the orders already alluded to, or by those which
General Burgoyne brought out in the spring 1777, I understood that my
command was restrained to the limits of the province, and that General
Burgoyne was entirely from under my command, as soon as he passed the
limits of the province.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">26.</NOTE>Q. Did you apply to the secretary
of state for a reinforcement of 4000 men, as necessary for the campaign
of 1777?</P> 
<P>A. I recollect when General Burgoyne was coming home in the fall
of 1776, as I was perfectly satisfied with his conduct in the preceding
campaign, I talked over with him, in confidence, what I thought necessary
for the following campaign; among other things I desired him to make a
memorandum to demand 4000 men, as a reinforcement for the ensuing campaign,
or at least for four battalions. I think I have seen those memorandums
were accurately stated and laid before the House.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">27.</NOTE>Q. What part of that 4000 men which
you thought necessary for the campaign of 1777, was actually sent out to
Canada in that year?</P> 
<P>A. I do not accurately remember how many—I think a very
small part—You may have a very precise account from the returns.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">28.</NOTE>Q. Of that small part sent in
1777, did not a certain proportion arrive very late in the year?</P> 
<P>A. Yes, a part arrived late.</P> 
<P><PB N="23" REF="30"/><NOTE PLACE="marg">29.</NOTE>Q. After you
had received your orders from the secretary of state, did you appre∣hend
that General Burgoyne, as long as he was within the province of Canada, was
positively under your command?</P> 
<P>A. Yes, I did: as long as he was in the province of Canada, I
looked on him to be positively under my command; but the load of the
expedition being on his shoul∣ders, I thought it proper that he, in all
things should direct; and therefore I gave out immediate orders, that not
only the troops he was to command out of the pro∣vince, but all the departments
necessary for the assisting his expedition, should comply
immediately, and without delay, with every requisition and order he should
give. The reason of my doing so was, that no time might be lost. I only
required that they should report to me what orders they had received from
General Burgoyne. I believe those orders are also on the table.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">30.</NOTE>Q. Will you explain to the
Committee what you mean by the words, <HI>load of the expedition lying on
General Burgoyne's shoulders?</HI></P> 
<P>A. I had no particular meaning; they are words I should have
used on any expedi∣tion of importance.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">31.</NOTE>Q. If General Burgoyne had met with
very considerable difficulties to impede his progress within the province
of Canada, would you have thought yourself justifi∣able in giving any
orders to General Burgoyne, different from those transmitted to General
Burgoyne, through you, from the secretary of state?</P> 
<P>A. Had there been any difficulties in Canada, I would not have
given him up the command.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">32.</NOTE>Q. Having given up the command to
General Burgoyne, and having ordered all the troops to obey him, only reporting
their proceedings to you, would you after that, have thought yourself
justifiable to change the order to General Burgoyne, upon his meeting with
great difficulties on the frontiers of the neighbouring pro∣vinces?</P> 
<P>A. I really did not mean to evade the question in the least.
It did not appear to me possible that there could be any difficulties. I
don't mean to say there could not, from the nature of the country, be
difficulties in the march that might occasion delay, but by the nature of the
question I understood difficulties from the enemy. In that case I
should not have thought myself justifiable in giving up the command.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">33.</NOTE>Q. If you had heard, that on the
frontiers, and within the province of Canada, there was the greatest reason
to think, that the resistance of General Burgoyne's army was so great as
to make it, in your opinion, exceedingly difficult for that General to force
his way to Albany, would you think yourself justifiable in giving different
or∣ders to General Burgoyne, from those given by the secretary of state;
or would you have thought the secretary of state's orders for General
Burgoyne's army so peremp∣tory that it would not be proper for you to
interfere?</P> 
<P>A. If I understood the question as it now stands, it is
what I would have done, had the province been invaded, or close on the point
of being invaded, and the enemy entering the province.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">34.</NOTE>Q. The question does not mean an
invading army, but a resistance from the enemy to the progress of General
Burgoyne's army, in the case stated in the last ques∣tion?</P> 
<P><PB N="24" REF="31"/>A. In that case, that an enemy should be
found (within the limits of my com∣mand) I should have ordered all the troops
destined for the defence of the province, to have immediately joined those
destined for General Burgoyne, and have reassum∣ed the command of all,
until those obstructions had been removed, within the limits of my
authority.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">35.</NOTE>Q. Suppose no enemy within the
province of Canada, but posted in such a manner upon the line of
communication with Albany, as to make it exceeding difficult for General
Burgoyne to obey the orders given to him, would you think yourself
justi∣fiable in giving different orders to General Burgoyne, from those
given by the se∣cretary of state; or would you have thought the secretary
of state's orders for General Burgoyne's army so peremptory that it would
not be proper for you to interfere?</P> 
<P>A. I could not change General Burgoyne's orders one tittle, that
was my opinion; he received his orders from the same power that gave me my
authority; when once he passed the limits of my command, I neither could
give him orders, nor would he be justified in obeying them.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">36.</NOTE>Q. Do you mean the latter part of
that answer as an answer to a question which supposes General
Burgoyne within the limits of the province of Canada?</P> 
<P>A. No: while he was within the limits of the province of Canada,
I would have given General Burgoyne orders in all cases of difficulty and
danger. There being no such case when General Burgoyne arrived in Canada,
in 1777, nor a pos∣sibility of an event of that sort, I put the troops
and all things under his com∣mand, which concerned his expedition, that he
might arrange and combine their motions according to his own plan of operation
for the campaign, that no time might be lost by any unnecessary
applications to me, which the strict forms of my command might otherwise
require.</P></Q><STAGE>[Withdrew.</STAGE></P>
<P><HI>Again called in.</HI> 
<Q> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">37.</NOTE>Q. Should you, if you had been in
General Burgoyne's situation, and acting un∣der the orders which you know he
received, have thought yourself bound to pursue them implicitly, or at
liberty to deviate from them?</P> 
<P>A. I should certainly have thought myself bound to have
obeyed them to the ut∣most of my power; but, to say as a military man, that
in all cases possible, I must have gone on, is a very nice thing to
say indeed; it must have thrown me, and I suppose every officer, into a
most unpleasant and anxious situation, to have de∣bated within himself,
whether he was or was not to go on. Every man must decide for himself. What
I would have done, I really don't know; the particular situation, and a man's
own particular feelings, must determine the point. If I might be indul∣ged, I
would beg leave to say, that I did not mean to evade any question; I meant
to answer directly; yet questions may be put to me, of so delicate a
nature, and perhaps no man in the world is in a more delicate situation, with
respect to the present case in question, and the business of this
Committee, than I am; when such questions are put to me, I shall pray the
indulgence of the Committee, to be excused answering <PB N="25" REF="32"/>
them, but I will not evade them. As I now understand the meaning of the right
honourable member in the former questions to be, Whether I should have
taken upon me to supersede the King's orders, supposing I knew of any
unsurmountable difficulties in the way, as that I had information of 20,000
men at Ticonderoga, before General Burgoyne left the province of Canada, I
should have told General Burgoyne my information? But it was General Burgoyne
who was to carry the orders into execution, and not me, and therefore it was
upon his own judgment he was to determine; I should have given him my
opinion, but I think I had no right to give him orders under those
circumstances.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">38.</NOTE>Q. Who was it that made the
arrangement and distribution of the troops that were to be left for the
defence of Canada, independent of those under the command of General
Burgoyne?</P> 
<P>A. The orders that are before the House are very full, and I
thought very clear. The Committee will see in those orders the troops that
were destined for General Burgoyne's expedition, and the troops that were to
remain for the defence of the province.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">39.</NOTE>Q. Who made that distribution?</P> 
<P>A. It came to me from the secretary of state.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">40.</NOTE>Q. Did not the orders from the
secretary of state go to the detail of the smallest posts within the
province?</P> 
<P>A. The letter is before the Committee.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">41.</NOTE>Question repeated.</P> 
<P>A. I should beg for the letter to be read; I don't wish to
avoid any question, but I wish to be accurate.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">42.</NOTE>Q. Was the distribution of the
troops prescribed to you by the secretary of state, or left to your
discretion?</P> 
<P>A. In mentioning the number of troops which were to remain in
that province, it was there said that those troops would be sufficient
for garrisoning such and such places, particularizing them.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">43.</NOTE>Q. Did you ever know an instance,
in your military life, of a minister making a distribution of troops for
the defence of a province, without taking the opinion or leaving a great deal
to the discretion of the governor of that province, that governor being an
acting military officer of very high rank?</P> 
<P>A. I never had the honour to correspond with a secretary of
state till I was ap∣pointed to the command of that province.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">44.</NOTE>Q. Whether you was consulted upon
the practicability of penetrating from the frontiers of Canada to Albany by
force, with the strength allotted to General Bur∣goyne for that
purpose?</P> 
<P>A. No; I was not.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">45.</NOTE>Q. Are you acquainted with the
passage from New York to Canada by the Hud∣son's River.</P> 
<P>A. I have gone that way.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">46.</NOTE>Q. Have you observed it with a
view to military operations? </P> 
<P>A. No; I never made the tour having any military operations in
view.</P> 
<P><PB N="26" REF="33"/><NOTE PLACE="marg">47.</NOTE>Q. Are you
acquainted with the forces which Sir William Howe had under his immediate
command at and about New York, on the 17th of July, 1777?</P> 
<P>A. I am not.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">48.</NOTE>Q. Supposing Sir William Howe had
12,000 effective men, besides a sufficient force lodged in New York, Staten
Island, and Long Island, to defend them against General Washington's
army, supposing General Washington's army in the Jersies, near Quibble
Town, and that Sir William Howe had received accounts of General Burgoyne's
success at Ticonderoga, and was acquainted with the orders under which
General Burgoyne acted; is it your opinion that the best movement Sir William
Howe could have made for the purposes of forwarding the execution of the
orders, under which General Burgoyne acted, would have been to have sailed
with his army from New York to Chesapeak Bay?</P> 
<P>A. Had I had the honour to have commanded on that side, I do
not know what I should have done myself.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">49.</NOTE>Q. After you received the letter
from Sir William Howe, informing you of his intended expedition to the
southward, whether you did expect that Sir William Howe's army could
co-operate on the Hudson's River with the northern army that season?</P> 
<P>A. I don't know.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">50.</NOTE>Q. Whether you thought, after the
receipt of that letter, that it was probable there would be a co-operation from
the southern army?</P> 
<P>A. I took it for granted, that Sir William Howe knew what he was
about, and would do what he thought best for the public service. I really
was so little in∣formed of all the particular circumstances of his
situation and of the provinces under his command, that I could form no
judgment of the propriety or impropriety of his conduct, or of the effects of
his measures.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">51.</NOTE>Q. Did your information lead you to
believe, that the inhabitants between Sara∣toga and Albany, were so well
affected to his Majesty and Great Britain, as that there would be much
advantage derived from their assistance to the King's army in the
prosecution of General Burgoyne's expedition?</P> 
<P>A. I had frequent accounts from that part of the country, that
there were numbers ready to take arms and join the King's troops if they
should penetrate so far.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">52.</NOTE>Q. Do you mean, by <HI>penetrating
so far,</HI> to Albany, or to the length the army got?</P> 
<P>A. The whole extent of the inhabited country, according to the
information brought to me.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">53.</NOTE>Q. Had you no information that a
formidable militia might be raised in that country to oppose his
Majesty's arms?</P> 
<P>A. Yes; I had such information.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">54.</NOTE>Q. Did you think that the force
which General Burgoyne carried with him from Ticonderoga towards Albany was
sufficient to oppose such force?</P> 
<P>A. I really must beg leave to be excused answering that
question.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">55.</NOTE>Q. If you had been consulted
respecting General Burgoyne's expedition, knowing the nature of that country,
and the force General Burgoyne had, would you or not have advised such an
enterprize?</P> 
<P><PB N="27" REF="34"/>A. If I had had the honour to command in
that campaign as I had in the former, I don't precisely know what I should
have done myself.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">56.</NOTE>Q. Did you give any advice for
employing the savages? </P> 
<P>A. I don't recollect that I said any thing about them.</P></Q><STAGE>[Withdrew.</STAGE></P>

confidence?</P> 
<P>A. Yes, I had.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">4.</NOTE>Q. Had you reason to believe
that General Fraser was consulted by Genaral Bur∣goyne in all material
operations?</P> 
<P>A. I had reason to believe that General Fraser was
consulted in many material operations.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">5.</NOTE>Q. Does your Lordship know or
believe that the proportion of artillery, at∣tached to General Fraser's corps
through the whole campaign, was according to his requisitions and
desires?</P> 
<P>A. I understood from General Fraser, that the proportion
of artillery allotted to him was agreeable to his own requisitions.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">6.</NOTE>Q. Do you recollect the number of
killed and wounded in General Fraser's corps, at the affair of Huberton?</P> 
<P>A. I don't recollect exactly; I think it was about 150.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">7.</NOTE>Q. What was your opinion of the
behaviour of the enemy on that day? </P> 
<P>A. Circumstanced as the enemy was, as an army very hard
pressed in their retreat, they certainly behaved with great gallantry.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">8.</NOTE>Q. Was it practicable, the nature
of the country, the fatigue of the King's troops, the care of the wounded, and
other circumstances considered, to have pursued the enemy farther after
that action?</P> 
<P>A. It was not</P> 
<P><PB N="30" REF="35"/><NOTE PLACE="marg">9.</NOTE>Q. Do you
recollect on what day General Fraser's corps rejoined the army at
Skenesborough?</P> 
<P>A. On the 9th of July; I think that it was on that day.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">10.</NOTE>Q. On what day was the action at
Huberton?</P> 
<P>A. On the 7th of July.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">11.</NOTE>Q. Do you recollect the
difficulties of removing the wounded from Huberton to the hospital at
Ticonderoga?</P> 
<P>A. From the distance and badness of the roads, the
difficulties attending the re∣moving of the hospital must have been very
great.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">12.</NOTE>Q. Was it practicable, unless
the wounded had been left exposed to the enemy, to have rejoined the army
sooner?</P> 
<P>A. It was not.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">13.</NOTE>Q. Does your Lordship recollect
how the army was employed between that time and the march to Fort Edward?</P> 
<P>A. The British were employed in opening the country and
making roads to Fort Anne; the Germans under General Reidesel were detached
about fourteen miles to the left.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">14.</NOTE>Q. Do you recollect the post
the enemy abandoned upon the ascent from the Low Country to the Pitch Pine
Plains, in the march from Fort Anne to Fort Ed∣ward?</P> 
<P>A. I do recollect such a place.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">15.</NOTE>Q. Had the enemy maintained their
ground on that post, do you apprehend that a considerable portion of
artillery would have been necessary to dislodge them?</P> 
<P>A. Artillery would certainly have been of great use to
dislodge the enemy.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">16.</NOTE>Q. Did you ever see an
instance, during your service in America, that the rebels continued
twenty-four hours on the same place without entrenching; and was it not
also their general practice to add abbaties to their entrenchments?</P> 
<P>A. The rebels were always indefatigable in securing
themselves by entrench∣ments, and in general they added an abbatis to those
entrenchments.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">17.</NOTE>Q. Do you remember the position
the enemy abandoned at Schuyler's Island?</P> 
<P>A. I do remember to have passed such an post once.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">18.</NOTE>Q. Does you Lordship think that
position could have been forced without a numerous artillery or heavy
loss?</P> 
<P>A. I do not think it could.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">19.</NOTE>Q. From the nature of that
country, do you think that post could have been turned?</P> 
<P>A. Not without greatly risquing the boats and portable
magazines.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">20.</NOTE>Q. Is it possible at any time
in that country, and with a small army, to quit the navigable rivers, without
leaving the boats and portable magazines exposed?</P> 
<P>A. I imagine it is not.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">21.</NOTE>Q. Did you live in habits of
intimacy and communication with General Fraser?</P> 
<P>A. I did.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">22.</NOTE>Q. Was General Fraser of a
warmth and openness of temper that generally made him communicative of his
sentiments, when they differed from the sentiments of those with whom he
acted?</P> 
<P><PB N="29" REF="36"/>A. General Fraser's temper was warm,
open, and communicative, but reserved in matters of confidence.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">23.</NOTE>Q. Did you ever hear General
Fraser express disapprobation of the measure of pas∣sing Hudson's
River?</P> 
<P>A. I never did.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">24.</NOTE>Q. Was not a bridge constructed
of rafts, and some boats thrown over that river, a little before the time of
the attack on Bennington?</P> 
<P>A. There was.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">25.</NOTE>Q. Did not General Fraser's
corps pass the river by that bridge, and take post on the heights of
Saratoga?</P> 
<P>A. It did.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">26.</NOTE>Q. Do you remember that bridge
being carried away by the torrents and bad weather, whereby the communication
was cut off between that corps and the main body of the army?</P> 
<P>A. I do.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">27.</NOTE>Q. Was General Fraser's corps
recalled after that action, and obliged to repass the river in boats and
scowls?</P> 
<P>A. It was.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">28.</NOTE>Q. Do you remember General
Fraser expressing his sorrow for being obliged to re∣turn back over the
Hudson's River?</P> 
<P>A. I remember General Fraser mentioning it with regret.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">29.</NOTE>Q. Had the rear guard of General
Fraser's corps been attacked during that pas∣sage over the river, would
not a powerful fire of artillery from the opposite shore have been of great
use, if not the only means of protecting them?</P> 
<P>A. If the enemy had attacked General Fraser, they would have
found him in a very bad posture; it was impossible to take a better, and,
as they could not be sup∣ported by the line, the only means of safety
must have been to get under cover of the fire of our artillery.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">30.</NOTE>Q. Was there not an expectation
and impatience of the troops in general to pass Hudson's River, and advance
on the enemy?</P> 
<P>A. There was.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">31.</NOTE>Q. Was there not a general
confidence and alacrity on the occasion? </P> 
<P>A. There was.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">32.</NOTE>Q. From these circumstances,
and your other knowledge of the army, do you not believe that to have made no
further attempt on the enemy would have caused dis∣appointment and
dejection in the troops, and reflections on the general?</P> 
<P>A. The troops were in the highest spirits, and wished to
be led on.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">33.</NOTE>Q. Does your Lordship recollect
the march up to the enemy on the morning of the 19th of September?</P> 
<P>A. I do.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">34.</NOTE>Q. Was the combination of the
march such, as, that notwithstanding the pas∣sage of the ravines and
the thickness of the woods, the column of General Fraser's march, and that
of the British line, led by General Burgoyne, were in a situation to
support each other, and speedily to form in line of battle, at the time the
enemy be∣gan the attack?</P> 
<P><PB N="30" REF="37"/>A. After the columns had passed the
ravines, they arrived at their respective posts with great precision in
point of time, and every fortunate circumstance attend∣ed the forming of the
line.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">35.</NOTE> Q How long did that action
last?</P> 
<P>A. The British were attacked partially about one o'clock.
The action was gene∣ral at three, and ended at seven o'clock.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">36.</NOTE>Q. From the nature of the
country, was it possible to discern the enemy's posi∣tion or movements,
to form any judgment what attacks were in force, and what were feints?</P> 
<P>A. I think not.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">37.</NOTE>Q. Did we remain masters of the
field of battle?</P> 
<P>A. We did.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">38.</NOTE>Q. Had the field of battle been
well disputed by the enemy?</P> 
<P>A. The enemy behaved with great obstinacy and courage.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">39.</NOTE>Q. Was it too dark to pursue
with effect at the time the action ended?</P> 
<P>A. It was.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">40.</NOTE>Q. Did the King's troops take up
ground nearer to the enemy, the morning after the action?</P> 
<P>A. It was rather nearer to the enemy.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">41.</NOTE>Q. How near were the out-posts
of General Fraser's corps to the out-posts of the enemy from that time to
the action of the 7th of October?</P> 
<P>A. I should imagine within half a mile.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">42.</NOTE>Q. From the nature of the
country, and the situation of the enemy's out-posts, was it possible to
reconnoitre their position?</P> 
<P>A. From the nature of the country, the difficulties attending
reconnoitering must have been very great.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">43.</NOTE>Q. Were not the riflemen, and
other irregulars, employed by the enemy at out-posts and on scouts, an
overmatch for the Indian or provincial troops that were with the army at that
time?</P> 
<P>A. They were.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">44.</NOTE>Q. Was not General Fraser's
corps continually at work during the interval above∣mentioned, in securing
their own posts, and opening the front to oppose the enemy?</P> 
<P>A. They were.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">45.</NOTE>Q. After General Fraser
received his wound, on the 7th of October, on whom did the command of his corps
devolve?</P> 
<P>A. On me.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">46.</NOTE>Q. Was you in a situation on
that day, to observe the general disposition of the army, made by General
Burgoyne, previous to the action?</P> 
<P>A. I remember two redoubts having been erected on the left, to
cover the boats and provisions to enable General Burgoyne to make a
detachment from his army.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">47.</NOTE>Q. Was you in a situation to
observe the disposition made immediately before the attack by the
enemy?</P> 
<P>A. I only recollect the situation of the two battalions of
the advanced corps.</P> 
<P><PB N="31" REF="38"/><NOTE PLACE="marg">48.</NOTE>Q. After the
retreat to the lines, were the lines attacked, and with what de∣gree of
vigour?</P> 
<P>A. The lines were attacked, and with as much fury as the fire
of small arms can admit.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">49.</NOTE>Q. Does your Lordship remember
that part of the lines where you commanded, being visited by General Burgoyne
during the attack?</P> 
<P>A. I don't recollect to have seen General Burgoyne.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">50.</NOTE>Q. Was the cannon of great use
in the repulse of the enemy in your post? </P> 
<P>A. Of very great use.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">51.</NOTE>Q. Do you think that post would
have been tenable next morning, the enemy having possession of Colonel
Briemen's post?</P> 
<P>A. I do not think it would.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">52.</NOTE>Q. Would the possession
of the post by the enemy, together with the posses∣sion of Colonel
Briemen's posts, have laid open the flank and rear of the camp of the
line?</P> 
<P>A. It would.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">53.</NOTE>Q. Was the retreat in the night,
and the new disposition of the whole army made in good order and without
loss?</P> 
<P>A. It was.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">54.</NOTE>Q. Did the army remain under
arms, and in momentary expectation of battle, the whole of the day of the
8th?</P> 
<P>A. It did.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">55.</NOTE>Q. Do you remember the
confusion and difficulties attending the line of baggage in the retreat, in
the night of the 8th?</P> 
<P>A. I do.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">56.</NOTE>Q. Was not the retreat
nevertheless made in good order by the troops, and without loss?</P> 
<P>A. It was.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">57.</NOTE>Q. Does your Lordship remember
the weather, the state of the roads, the state of the cattle, and the
difficulty of passing the Fish Kiln, in the retreat to Saratoga, in the
day and night of the 9th?</P> 
<P>A. It rained incessantly, consequently the roads were
bad; the cattle were nearly starved for want of forage, and the bridge over
the Fish Kill had been destroyed by the enemy; the troops were obliged to
ford the river.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">58.</NOTE>Q. Had there been no enemy to
oppose us, or no bridges or roads to repair, would it have been possible,
from the state of the fatigue of the troops, to have continued the march
farther immediately after the arrival at Saratoga?</P> 
<P>A. The troops were greatly fatigued, and the artillery had
been left on the other side of the Fish Kill.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">59.</NOTE>Q. Why were they left on the
other side of the Fish Kill? </P> 
<P>A. The bridge had been destroyed by the enemy; it was
exceeding dark, and I do not know whether the ford was passable for the
artillery without being first exa∣mined.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">60.</NOTE>Q. Do you remember the enemy
opening a battery on the opposite side of Hudson's River, and the
circumstances attending the opening that battery?</P> 
<P><PB N="32" REF="39"/>A. The corps I commanded was at that time
posted, and they fired on us at that time, but I do not know from what
direction.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">61.</NOTE>Q. Does your Lordship remember
the shot from that battery going over the table when you and several
officers were at dinner?</P> 
<P>A. I did not dine with General Burgoyne that day—I
recollect hearing a cannon shot had discomposed the company at the
general's table.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">62.</NOTE>Q. Consequently must not that
battery have commanded the ford over the Hudson's River?</P> 
<P>A. I believe I said, I did not recollect from what direction
the shot came, but they had a battery which commanded that ford.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">63.</NOTE>Q. Do you recollect on what day
you was called, with other commanders of corps, to the first council of
war?</P> 
<P>A. On the 13th of October.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">64.</NOTE>Q. Was there a spot in the
whole position to be found for holding that council, which was not exposed
to cannon or rifle-shot?</P> 
<P>A. We were not so fortunate as to find one.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">65.</NOTE>Q. Do you recollect that General
Burgoyne, after stating to the council the difficul∣ties of the situation,
declare, that nothing should induce him to propose terms to the enemy
without the general concurrence of the generals and field officers of the army,
and that he was ready to take the lead in any measure that they should
think for the honour of the British arms, or words to that effect?</P> 
<P>A. I remember words to that effect.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">66.</NOTE>Q. Was the concurrence unanimous
for treating on honourable terms?</P> 
<P>A. I hope I shall stand justified with the members of
that council, when I have the honour to declare to this House, that our
situation appeared to them so decided as not to admit of one dissenting
voice.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">67.</NOTE>Q. When Colonel Kingston
brought back the first proposition, wherein it was spe∣cified by Major
General Gates, that the army should lay down their arms in their
entrenchments and surrender prisoners of war, does your Lordship
remember, that General Burgoyne, when he read them to the council, declared, he
would not set his hand to those conditions, or words to that effect?</P> 
<P>A. I think the words of the proposal from General Gates
were, That the British army should be ordered, by word of command from
their adjutant general, to lay down their arms in the entrenchments. It was
rejected with disdain by General Bur∣gone, and the council concurred in his
indignation.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">68.</NOTE>Q. Were the counter proposals,
penned by General Burgoyne, unanimously ap∣proved?</P> 
<P>A. They were.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">69.</NOTE>Q. When those proposals had
been agreed to by General Gates, but copies not signed by either party, do
you remember General Burgoyne informing the council of intelligence he had
received from a spy in the night, and submitting to their considera∣tion,
whether it was consistent with public faith, and if so, expedient to
suspend the execution of the treaty and trust to events?</P> 
<P>A. I do remember it.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">70.</NOTE>Q. Does your Lordship recollect
what was the result of that consideration?</P> 
<P><PB N="33" REF="40"/>A. The determination of the council, on
the question being put, was, that the pu∣blic faith was <HI>bona fide</HI>
plighted.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">71.</NOTE>Q. Though that was the opinion of
the majority, was there not a difference of opi∣nion in the council?</P> 
<P>A. There was.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">72.</NOTE>Q. Where the opinions of the
several commanding officers asked respecting the con∣dition of their
respective corps, and what might be expected from them severally in
desperate cases?</P> 
<P>A. It was.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">73.</NOTE>Q. Was there not on that
question also difference of opinion? </P> 
<P>A. There was.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">74.</NOTE>Q. After the Convention took
place, did your Lordship see the army of General Gates pass in review
before General Burgoyne and General Phillips?</P> 
<P>A. I did.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">75.</NOTE>Q. From the manner and silence
of their march, the order observed in keeping their divisions, and an
apparent attention to their officers, did that army appear disciplined?</P> 
<P>A. They marched in good order and were silent, and seemed
to pay attention to their officers. These are essential points of
discipline, but I saw nothing farther of it.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">76.</NOTE>Q. From the general behaviour of
the rebel troops in the different actions in which you was present in the
course of the campaign, did you think them disciplined and respectable
troops?</P> 
<P>A. When I answered the last question, I spoke to the
manoeuvre I saw upon the spot. At all times when I was opposed to the
rebels, they fought with great courage and obstinacy.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">77.</NOTE>Q. Judging by your eye, and the
time the rebel army was marching in review, did you form any judgment of their
number?</P> 
<P>A. It requires great experience to make a computation of
numbers by seeing them pass: as far as I could judge on the occasion,
they seemed to me to amount to thir∣teen or fourteen thousand rank and file
under arms.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">78.</NOTE>Q. Has your Lordship reason
to know or believe, that the troops that passed in re∣view were exclusive
of those corps that had been posted on the other side of the Hud∣son's
River?</P> 
<P>A. They were exclusive of those corps.</P></Q></P>
<P> <HI>Examined by other Members of the Committee and by General
Burgoyne occasionally.</HI> 
<Q> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">79.</NOTE>Q. What was the general opinion
of the army of General Burgoyne's behaviour in action and in difficulty?</P> 
<P>A. It appeared to me, that General Burgoyne always
possessed himself in every situation of danger and difficulty, and,
I may venture to say, it appeared so to the army.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">80.</NOTE>Q. Had General Burgoyne the
confidence of the army? </P> 
<P>A. He had.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">81.</NOTE>Q. After the arrival of the
troops at Cambridge, were the officers and soldiers of <PB N="34" REF="41"/>
the army satisfied with the general's efforts to contribute to their comfort,
and redress their grievances?</P> 
<P>A. They were.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">82.</NOTE>Q. Was the army satisfied with
the general's behaviour at the court martial held on Colonel Henley?</P> 
<P>A. He carried on that prosecution in person, and as such
they were satisfied with him.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">83.</NOTE>Q. Did your Lordship ever hear
any officer or soldier of that army express any dissa∣tisfaction at the
general's returning to England?</P> 
<P>A. I did not.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">84.</NOTE>Q. Does your Lordship think
that the officers of that army wish to have their re∣spective merits
stated to their Sovereign, by the general in person who had the honour of
commanding them?</P> 
<P>A. It was the wish of that army that General Burgoyne
should go to Europe, to justify not only his own conduct, but the conduct
of the army he commanded.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">85.</NOTE>Q. Does your Lordship
apprehend, that the return of General Burgoyne to that army, under personal
disgrace, and without any distribution of preferment among the
distinguished officers of that army, would be any sort of consolation
to the troops under captivity?</P> 
<P>A. General Burgoyne, at all times, shared the dangers and
afflictions of that army in common with every soldier; as such they looked
on him as their friend, and cer∣tainly would have received him in person, or
any accounts of him, with every mark of affection.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">86.</NOTE>Q. Your Lordship having said
that if the rebels had maintained their post, at the ascent from the Low
Countries to the Pitch Pine Plains, in the march from Fort Anne to Fort Edward,
artillery would have been of great use to dislodge them; will your
Lordship say what kind of artillery, of what calibre, would have been
necessary for that purpose?</P> 
<P>A. Any of the artillery officers now under the order of the
House can give a much more satisfactory answer to that question than I
possibly can.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">87.</NOTE> Q Did you see that post?</P>

<P>A. I think I said I did see it.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">88.</NOTE>Q. With what kind of work was
that post fortified?</P> 
<P>A. I spoke of it merely from its situation.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">89.</NOTE>Q. Were there then any works or
none?</P> 
<P>A. I don't recollect there were any works.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">90.</NOTE>Q. If the army, after taking
Ticonderoga, had been embarked, and proceeded directly to South Bay, would
there have been any occasion to have attacked the post at Pitch Pine Plains
at all?</P> 
<P>A. The army did proceed by South Bay, excepting a detachment
of General Fraser's corps, and some Germans to support him; and the army
assembled at Skenesborough on the 9th or 10th of July.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">91.</NOTE>Q. Was it necessary to go to
the post at Pitch Pine Plains, in order to go to South Bay?</P> 
<P>A. They had no sort of connection with each other.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">92.</NOTE>Q. Might not the army have
proceeded to Fort Edward, and omitted the attack of that pass, supposing
it had been meant to be defended?</P> 
<P><PB N="35" REF="42"/>A. There were two routes to Fort Edward.
General Burgoyne might still go the same route without any necessity of
attacking that post, as there might have been many different ways of
dislodging the enemy from that post without attacking it.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">93.</NOTE>Q. In how many instances do you
remember the rebels defending their entrench∣ments after they had made
them?</P> 
<P>A. We never got a view of any of their entrenchments but
such as they had voluntarily abandoned.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">94.</NOTE>Q. Is it then to be understood
that they never defended any entrenchments? </P> 
<P>A. They never did.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">95.</NOTE>Q. Did you ever hear General
Fraser express his approbation of the passing of the Hudson's
River?</P> 
<P>A. I never did.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">96.</NOTE>Q. Did you ever hear General
Fraser express his approbation of the Bennington expedition?</P> 
<P>A. That detachment was made, and the business concluded,
before I ever heard of the project or execution.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">97.</NOTE>Q. Have you occasion to know,
when the first detachment was sent out under Co∣lonel Baume, where they
were ordered to rejoin General Burgoyne, after they had per∣formed the
service they were sent on?</P> 
<P>A. I don't know.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">98.</NOTE>Q. Whether, in your Lordship's
opinion, after the loss the rebels had sustained over night, in the
action of the 19th of September, if they had been attacked briskly at break
of day, the next day, there was a probability that they could have stood
their ground?</P> 
<P>A. I have not hesitated to give an opinion upon supposed
matters, which must have been attended with evident and demonstrable
consequences; but I beg the indulgence of the House in declining to give
any opinion upon any question relative to speculation or judgment. Had any
general officer of that army under General Burgoyne been present in this
country, I should have confined myself merely to the manoeuvres of the
corps I commanded. As there is no general officer here, I wish to give this
House every information consistent with my rank in the army.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">99.</NOTE>Q. Had you any information that
might indicate to you that the rebels were pre∣pared to decamp after the action
of the 19th of September?</P> 
<P>A. I was ignorant of any such intelligence being
received.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">100.</NOTE>Q. Had you any information of
their baggage being packed up? </P> 
<P>A. I have already answered, that I had no information at all
about it.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">101.</NOTE>Q. In the action of the 7th of
October, on which side did the rebels force our lines and make a
lodgement?</P> 
<P>A. The lines to the right were stormed and carried.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">102.</NOTE>Q. Were the lines attacked to
the left? </P> 
<P>A. To the left of that post they were, but not to the left
of the army.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">103.</NOTE>Q. Did not the
possession of Fort Edward, and the country thereabouts, cut off the
retreat of any garrison that might have been in Fort George?</P> 
<P>A. It undoubtedly did.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">104.</NOTE>Q. Had the army proceeded to
Fort George by Ticonderoga and Lake George, might not the enemy have remained
at Fort George till the trenches were opened, and have still had their
retreat secure?</P> 
<P><PB N="36" REF="43"/>A. That is a matter of opinion upon
speculation.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">105.</NOTE>Q. Do you not think that the
British army, being well provided with artillery, was a probable reason for
their not defending entrenchments?</P> 
<P>A. The reason they did not defend their entrenchments was,
that they always marched out of them and attacked us.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">106.</NOTE>Q. Does your Lordship think it
would have been adviseable, in point of prudence, or just to brave troops,
who had suffered severe loss, to attack an enemy the morning after that
loss, posted within entrenchments, which it was impossible to
recon∣noitre?</P> 
<P>A. That attempt was tried on the 7th of October, and did not
succeed.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">107.</NOTE>Q. Were not the enemy reinforced
between the 19th of September and the 7th of October?</P> 
<P>A. I think it is likely they were.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">108.</NOTE>Q. Were they likely to be in
better spirits to repel an attack the day after they had been repulsed with
great loss, or when they had been reinforced, and seen an army lie three
weeks inactive in their camp?</P> 
<P>A. I do not judge of the spirit of the enemy but when I was
opposed to them myself.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">109.</NOTE>Q. On the first day of the
action, when the enemy was repulsed on the 19th of September, had not our
army suffered very considerably?</P> 
<P>A. They suffered very considerable loss.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">110.</NOTE>Q. Was not the army recruited,
and in better order, on the 7th of October, than they were on the 20th of
September?</P> 
<P>A. Numbers of the men who had been wounded and disabled in
the action of the 19th, joined their corps on the 7th of October.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">111.</NOTE>Q. Was the behaviour of the
enemy, opposed to your Lordship, in the actions you have seen, such as
to make them contemptible in the eye of a soldier?</P> 
<P>A. I have already mentioned, that they fought at all times
with courage and ob∣stinacy.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">112.</NOTE>Q. Whether the behaviour of the
enemy was such as to make advantages obtained by them over his Majesty's
troops more humiliating and disgraceful to the British arms than the same
advantages obtained by an equal number of any other troops?</P> 
<P>A. I myself felt more humiliation until I considered that
those advantages proceeded from the nature of the country, and not from the
want of zeal or bravery in the Bri∣tish troops.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">113.</NOTE>Q. Whether the enemy's troops
were such bad troops as to make it more disgraceful to have an advantage
obtained by them over the King's troops than by the like number of any other
enemy over a like number of his Majesty's troops in the same
circum∣stances of country?</P> 
<P>A. The advantages gained by the rebels over the British
troops proceeded from their local situation, and not from the want of courage
in the British troops. We were taught by experience that neither their
attacks nor resistance was to be de∣spised.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">114.</NOTE>Q. Did you ever serve
against any other troops?</P> 
<P>A. I commenced my service in America.</P> 
<P><PB N="37" REF="44"/><NOTE PLACE="marg">115.</NOTE>Q. Whether
the army under General Burgoyne, in general, expected co-operation in their
efforts to go to Albany, from the army under the command of Sir William
Howe?</P> 
<P>A. General Burgoyne gave it out in general orders, that he had
every reason to believe that powerful armies were acting in co-operation with
the army he had the honour to command.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">116.</NOTE>Q. Do you know at what time that
order was given out? </P> 
<P>A. The adjutant general's books will shew it: I think it was
about the 3d of October.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">117.</NOTE>Q. Does your Lordship believe
that if the army under General Howe had co-operated up the North River with the
army under General Burgoyne, that the army under General Burgoyne would have
been obliged to have made the convention it did?</P> 
<P>A. That is a matter of judgment. The army looked forward to
that co-operation, which they were led to understand, by the orders General
Burgoyne had given out, with pleasure.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">118.</NOTE>Q. What was the general opinion
of the officers of the army in which you served, on that subject of
co-operation?</P> 
<P>A. I do not think my rank in the army entitles me to give my
opinion on that sub∣ject; I shall still less presume to give that of
others.</P> </Q><STAGE>[Withdrew.</STAGE></P>
<P>Then he was called in again, and several parts of the
examination, particularly that which immediately follows the place where it is
said that his Lordship was examined by other members of the Committee, were
read, and then the last question which was put to his Lordship
immediately before he withdrew, was repeated, with this addition, 
<Q REND="inline">"To the best of your recollection and
information."</Q> 
<Q> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">119.</NOTE>A. I have already declined
answering that question.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">120.</NOTE>Q. When did you first know
that there was to be no co-operation from General Howe's army, and that Sir
William Howe had carried his army to Chesapeak Bay?</P> 
<P>A. I did not know that we were to expect no co-operation,
until after the con∣vention was signed.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">121.</NOTE>Q. When did you first hear
that Sir William Howe was gone to the south∣ward? </P> 
<P>A. It was reported so in the army about the beginning of the
campaign, before we crossed the river.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">122.</NOTE>Q. When was that report first
confirmed so as to make it a matter of belief? </P> 
<P>A. I never knew it was confirmed at all.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">123.</NOTE>Q. Whether you yourself was
not surprised or disappointed, or both, when you first understood
that there was not to be any co-operation from Sir William Howe, but that Sir
William Howe's army was gone to Chesapeak Bay?</P></Q><STAGE>[Withdrew.</STAGE></P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="45"/> <HI>Again called in.</HI> 
<Q> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">124.</NOTE>Q. Whether you yourself was
surprised or disappointed, or both, when you first heard that Sir
William Howe's army was gone to Chesapeak Bay?</P> 
<P>A. I neither knew the object of the campaign nor its
expectations, and there∣fore cannot speak to any manoeuvre of which I could
not know the tendency.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">125.</NOTE>Q. Did the army in general
express themselves pleased at the news of Sir Wil∣liam Howe's being gone
to Chesapeak Bay?</P> 
<P>A. The answer to the last question, as it relates to
me in particular, relates to them in general.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">126.</NOTE>Q. Whether your Lordship, as
a matter of fact, in the consideration you had in the army, on the news of
Sir William Howe's being gone to Chesapeak Bay, heard those you conversed
with express themselves pleased, or talk of that expedi∣tion to
Chesapeak, as a powerful co-operation with General Burgoyne?</P> 
<P>A. I think that question is fully answered in the two
preceding ones.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">127.</NOTE>Q. Whether you did not think
General Howe's fighting General Washington's grand army, at the battle of
Brandywine, was a very capital co-operation with the army under General
Burgoyne?</P> 
<P>A. I was not at Brandywine.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">128.</NOTE>Q. Whether you was not
surprised when you returned home to this country, to learn that the
secretary of state for the American department, had information from
General Howe, of his intentions of going to the southward, before General
Burgoyne departed from this country, and never communicated that information to
General Burgoyne before his departure for Canada?</P> 
<P>A. I have the honour to stand before this House as a
military man, and not as a politician, and cannot answer any question but
those relative to my own profession.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">129.</NOTE>Q. What was your Lordship's
opinion of the spirit of your own corps?</P> 
<P>A. The opinion I gave in the council of war, relative to the
spirit of the corps I commanded was, that they were willing and zealous to
undertake any enterprise that General Burgoyne would please to employ them
upon.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">130.</NOTE>Q. When advice was received
that Sir Henry Clinton was coming up the North River, did you apprehend the
treaty of convention had gone so far that it could not be broken?</P> 
<P>A. My opinion was, with respect to that question, that
all military negotiations were fair and justifiable, to make delays and to
gain time; I therefore thought and declared my sentiments, that General
Burgoyne was at full liberty to break off that treaty in the stage it then
was; and I could not conceive that the public faith was engaged, until the
treaty was actually signed and exchanged.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">131. By General Burgoyne.</NOTE>Q.
Whether the opinion of General Burgoyne, of General Phillips, of Brigadier
Hamilton, and several other officers, did not coincide with your opinion in
all the matters comprised in the last question?</P> 
<P>A. As General Burgoyne seems desirous that I should
answer that question, I de∣clare his sentiments were the same with
those I have now delivered. I hope that <PB N="39" REF="46"/> the other
members of that council, will soon be in a situation to stand forward and
to declare the opinion they gave on that and every other question.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">132. By General Burgoyne.</NOTE>Q. When
the question relative to the point of public faith was decided, by the
majority of the council, was not the concurrence for signing the convention
una∣nimous?</P> 
<P>A. It was.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">133.</NOTE>Q. What day was it first
known that Sir Henry Clinton had taken the highlands, and was coming up the
North River?</P> 
<P>A. In the night of the 16th of
October.</P></Q><STAGE>[Withdrew.</STAGE></P>

<P>CAPTAIN MONEY called in and examined by General Burgoyne. 
<Q> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">1.</NOTE>Q. WAS not you deputy quarter
master general of the army under General Bur∣goyne, in 1777?</P> 
<P>A. I was.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">2.</NOTE>Q. After Lieutenant Colonel
Carleton returned to Canada, was you the superior officer in that
department?</P> 
<P>A. I was.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">3.</NOTE>Q. As such, did you make it your
business from the beginning of the campaign to get a knowledge of the
country?</P> 
<P>A. Whenever there was any occasion to obtain the knowledge
of any particular part of the country, a party was always sent with me for
that purpose, but the woods were so thick that it was impossible to go
without a party.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">4.</NOTE>Q. Was you well acquainted with
the country between Skenesborough and Fort Edward?</P> 
<P>A. I was.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">5.</NOTE>Q. How long was the army employed
in making the roads practicable between Skenesborough and Fort Edward?</P> 
<P>A. About six or seven days in making the road between
Skenesborough and Fort Anne, and between Fort Anne and Fort Edward. I do not
believe the army was delayed an hour on that account; there was a very good
road made by the rebels the year before, between Fort Anne and Fort Edward, in
which road the rebels had cut down some few trees which took the provincials
in our army some few hours to clear.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">6.</NOTE>Q. Does not the possession
of the country in the neighbourhood of Fort Ed∣ward, necessarily prevent
the retreat of a garrison that might be in Fort George?</P> 
<P><PB N="40" REF="47"/>A. It prevents the getting off any
artillery or stores; but a garrison might get through the woods, in case
we were in the possession of the ground in the neighbourhood of Fort
Edward.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">7.</NOTE>Q. Did not the garrison of Fort
George evacuate the fort upon the approach of the King's troops toward Fort
Edward?</P> 
<P>A. I heard they did; I was not near enough to see.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">8.</NOTE>Q. Had the army taken their route
by South Bay, Ticonderoga, and Lake George, how many bateaux do you imagine it
would have taken to carry the troops solely over Lake George, exclusive of
provisions and stores?</P> 
<P>A. I think between three and four hundred, which bateaux
must have been car∣ried up out of Lake Champlain to Lake George.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">9.</NOTE>Q. What time would it have taken,
as you imagine, to have drawn those ba∣teaux over the land, between Lake
Champlain and Lake George, with the horses then at Ticonderoga?</P> 
<P>A. I suppose a fortnight—Four hundred bateaux.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">10.</NOTE>Q. Though there were no troops
passed over Lake George, how long did it take before the first
transport of provisions arrived at Fort George?</P> 
<P>A. I can't recollect precisely.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">11.</NOTE>Q. Considering the length of
time it took to transport the provisions, without the troops, over Lake
George, was not the army forwarder in their way to Alba∣ny, in point of time,
by the route they took, than they could have been by the route of Ticonderoga
and Lake George?</P> 
<P>A. I have already said, that it would take a fortnight to
transport the 400 ba∣teaux from Lake Champlain to Lake George; it therefore
would have delayed the army a fortnight longer than they were delayed to have
returned from Skenesborough by Ticonderoga, and gone across Lake
George.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">12.</NOTE>Q. Was you commissary of
horse, as well as deputy quarter master general?</P> 
<P>A. It was.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">13.</NOTE>Q. What is the nature of that
department?</P> 
<P>A. It was to take charge of all the horses furnished by
contract for General Burgoyne's army, by any letter of instructions from
General Burgoyne. I am di∣rected to give proper orders and directions to the
drivers, furnished by that con∣tract, for the purpose of transporting
provisions and stores brought to Fort George, for the use of the
army.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">14.</NOTE>Q. Did you report from time to
time to Major General Phillips, and take orders from him, as well as from
General Burgoyne?</P> 
<P>A. Yes.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">15.</NOTE>Q. Were not the orders from both
the generals invariable, precise, and pressing, for using all
possible diligence in forwarding the transport of provisions?</P> 
<P>A. They were. There was one order which I will read, as it
will fullv answer that question: it is dated August the 18th, Duer-Camp,
and is in these words; 
<Q> 
<TEXT LANG="eng">
<BODY>
<DIV1 TYPE="order">
<P>It having been a practice for officers to order to
be taken from the provision train, in the service of the King for this
army, the carts and horses, for the carrying baggage and other purposes, to
avoid for the future the danger and inconve∣niencies to the service, it is in
the most positive manner ordered, that no cart or horse are to be used
but for the public transport of the army; nor is any officer, 
<PB N="41" REF="48"/> accidentally coming to any particular post, to interfere
with the provision train, in any other manner than to give it every aid and
assistance, which he is on all occasions to do.</P>
</DIV1>
</BODY>
</TEXT></Q></P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">16.</NOTE>Q. Was not the transport of
merchandize, and even sutler's stores, as well as of officers' baggage,
positively forbid till the transport of provision should be over?</P> 
<P>A. There was such an order, and a seizure made of two
barrels of Madeira, and two barrels of rum, which were ordered to the
hospital.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">17.</NOTE>Q. Do you recollect General
Burgoyne's expressing, at several times, particular anxiety on the
subject of expediting the transport of provisions?</P> 
<P>A. I do remember once to have heard General Burgoyne express
his concern at our not being able to bring forward a greater quantity of
provision to enable him to proceed with the army.—I do recollect to
have heard him say with very great earnestness to General Phillips and
Colonel Carleton, that one month's provision at that particular time (it was
about the latter end of August) would be worth 100,000l. to Great
Britain.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">18.</NOTE>Q. Do you think that the
commissary of the waggons, and other carriages, was authorised to buy or
hire ox-teams wherever they could be had, and that all draught cattle taken,
were appropriated to the transport?</P> 
<P>A. He received such directions.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">19.</NOTE>Q. How many carts and ox-teams
could be mustered at any one time? </P> 
<P>A. I think only 180 carts could at any one time be mustered;
the number of ox-carts I really forget, but I believe between 20 and 30.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">20.</NOTE>Q. About how many days
provision for the troops, and all other persons fed from the King's
stores, could that number of carriages convey?</P> 
<P>A. There never was any trial made, but if I may presume to
judge from the proportion brought forward, over and above the daily
consumption of the army, should suppose all those carriages would not
carry more than four days provisions at most. I am speaking at random, as
no trial was made.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">21.</NOTE>Q. Did it not sometimes happen,
from accidents of weather, and roads, and the tired state of the cattle, that
not more than one day's provision could be brought forward in a day?</P> 
<P>A. It did.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">22.</NOTE>Q. How many hours did it take,
one hour with another, to draw a bateau from Fort George to Fort Edward?</P> 
<P>A. In general about six.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">23.</NOTE>Q. Was not the unloading the
carts at Fort Edward, and embarking the contents in bateaux, unloading the
bateaux at the upper falls of Fort Miller, and a second time unloading them
at the lower falls, dilatory as it was, a more expeditious method than it would
have been to have carried the provisions the whole way in carts?</P> 
<P>A. I do apprehend it was not possible, in the feeble
state I found the horses fur∣nished by contract, to have brought forward
the daily consumption of provisions for that army down to Fort Miller. In
the month of August, in the latter end of that month, at which time I was
appointed a commissary general of horse, I made, on <PB N="42" REF="49"/>
the first of September, a general muster, and found 30 horses
unserviceable, from fatigue and hard labour.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">24.</NOTE>Q. Was the transport of
provisions at any time impeded by the bringing forward the artillery from
Fort George?</P> 
<P>A. The artillery had a separate contract for horses, with
which they brought for∣ward their own stores. I don't recollect that any part
of the provision train were ever employed in bringing forward artillery or
artillery stores.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">25.</NOTE>Q. Was it possible, with the
means we had, to collect a month's store of provisions sooner than it was
collected?</P> 
<P>A. I believe not, without the utter ruin of the horses
furnished by contract for the purpose of transporting stores.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">26.</NOTE>Q. Was you present in the
action of the 19th of September?</P> 
<P>A. I was.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">27.</NOTE>Q. Did the enemy dispute the
field that day with obstinacy?</P> 
<P>A. They did, and the fire was much heavier than ever I saw
it any where, unless at the affair of Fort Anne.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">28.</NOTE>Q. Do you know how long the
regiments of the British line were under that fire?</P> 
<P>A. The three British regiments (the 20th, 21st, and 62d)
were engaged from three o'clock in the afternoon till seven in the evening;
and whilst I was a prisoner I heard the rebel quarter-master general
say, they had nine different regiments in the field, op∣posed to the three
British I have named.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">29.</NOTE>Q. Do you know the loss the
three British regiments sustained?</P> 
<P>A. I can't say.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">30.</NOTE>Q. Do you remember the strength
of the 62d regiment when they came out of the action?</P> 
<P>A. I can't speak to the particular strength of the
regiment when they came out of action; but I heard that they were not 100 rank
and file.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">31.</NOTE>Q. How many officers were left in
that regiment at the end of the action?</P> 
<P>A. I can't answer that question.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">32.</NOTE>Q. From the general state of
the three British regiments, do you think that they would have been in a
proper condition to have attacked the enemy the next morning?</P> 
<P>A. Certainly not; nor to go on any service whatever.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">33.</NOTE>Q. About what time of the day did
the enemy finally give way?</P> 
<P>A. They gave way very often; finally about seven in the
evening.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">34.</NOTE>Q. Was it practicable, at that
time of the evening, and in that kind of country, to have pursued?</P> 
<P>A. I should think not.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">35.</NOTE>Q. Was you not often employed,
between the day of that action and the action of the 7th of October, to
reconnoitre?</P> 
<P>A. I was.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">36.</NOTE>Q. Was you able to obtain a view
of the enemy's position?</P> 
<P>A. I obtained a view of the position of the right of the
rebel entrenchments.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">37.</NOTE>Q. What was the nature of their
position to the right, with regard to entrench∣ments?</P> 
<P><PB N="43" REF="50"/>A. They were posted on a hill that came
very near the river. On the top of the hill was a strong breast-work, at
the foot an abbatis.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">38.</NOTE>Q. Did it appear to you that that
wing of the enemy was attackable? </P> 
<P>A. It is a question that is scarcely in my line of
service to answer; but as there are no general officers, nor older officers
than myself, who served under General Bur∣goyne, I hope no military man
will think me presuming to give my opinion on that subject. I do think that
we could not have attacked the right wing of the rebel entrenchments without
risking the loss of the whole army, and with little probability of
success.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">39.</NOTE>Q. Could you obtain a view of the
left wing of the enemy? </P> 
<P>A. I never saw the left wing of the enemy's entrenchments
till I was taken prisoner and conducted through their works.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">40.</NOTE>Q. On the 7th of October was you
in a situation to see the enemy advancing to the attack of your left?</P> 
<P>A. Yes.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">41.</NOTE>Q. Did they advance under a well
served fire of grape-shot from our artillery? </P> 
<P>A. I was in a situation that gave me an opportunity of
seeing the directions of the rebels' columns; and I was very much
astonished to hear the shot from the enemy fly so thick, after our
cannonade had lasted a quarter of an hour.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">42.</NOTE>Q. When the British grenadiers
were forced last from their post, what ensued? </P> 
<P>A. I did not see the British grenadiers forced back. I
saw them on their march, as I apprehended, taking a different position; at
that time several of them broke their ranks, but on some aid du camps
calling to them for shame, to continue their rank, they marched away to their
station in good order. A battalion of Brunswickers that were on the left of
the artillery quitted their ground as soon as the firing began, and, to the
best of my recollection, I did not see they left a man behind them on the
ground. I would add, that after some difficulty that battalion was brought to
make a stand in the rear of the artillery, but in no order.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">43.</NOTE>Q. Was not that battalion brought
to that stand by the activity and exhortation of Major General
Reidesel?</P> 
<P>A. I did not see General Reidesel endeavour to stop the
battalion; but I saw an aid du camp of his and a brigade major, with their
drawn swords, keeping them up. I did see General Reidesel immediately
afterwards, on the right of the artillery, with the battalion perfectly formed,
and in good order.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">44.</NOTE>Q. Do you imagine that the giving
way of the battalion you first described was the cause that the artillery
on that spot was taken, and yourself and Major Williams being made
prisoners?</P> 
<P>A. I believe it contributed, in some measure, towards the
loss of the action on that day; but before Sir Francis Clarke died of his
wounds, he told me that he received his wound in bringing orders for the
artillery and the whole of the detach∣ment to return to camp; and to the
circumstance of Sir Francis Clarke's being wounded, I do attribute the loss
of the artillery, if not the loss of the whole army?</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">45.</NOTE>Q. Had you an opportunity, after
you was prisoner, to see the left of the enemy's entrenchments?</P> 
<P>A. I had.</P> 
<P><PB N="44" REF="51"/><NOTE PLACE="marg">46.</NOTE>Q. Was the
ground within cannon shot of the left open and commanding it?</P> 
<P>A. All the ground I saw was cleared and entrenched.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">47.</NOTE>Q. Was there not ground within
cannon shot that would have commanded that entrenchment on the left?</P> 
<P>A. There was.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">48.</NOTE>Q. Had we gained
possession of that ground, and been able to erect batteries of our
heaviest guns, would not the whole line of the enemy have been enfiladed?</P>

<P>A. The ground alluded to was entrenched, and commanded the
whole of the rebel camp and lines. If the army had got possession of
that ground, I do not believe the rebels would have staid one hour in their
camp.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">49.</NOTE>Q. Did you ever hear, in
conversation with the rebel officers, that General Ar∣nold, foreseeing that
inconvenience, had marched out of his lines, and attacked, without orders from
General Gates?</P> 
<P>A. I did hear that General Arnold had marched out on the 7th
of October, without orders from General Gates. I did also hear that he
advised the going out to meet Gene∣ral Burgoyne on his march, and engaging
him before he approached their lines; and the reason he gave was this: If
General Burgoyne should ever come near enough their lines to be able to make
use of his artillery, that he would certainly possess himself of
their camp; that their troops in that case would never stand any where; but
if, on the other hand, the rebels should be defeated in the woods, the troops
would, after that, have confidence in their works, for which reason Arnold
advised risking an action in the woods before General Burgoyne came near
enough to fee their works.</P></Q></P>

been the general opinion of the officers of General Burgoyne's conduct, as well
in action as in the many trying occasions which have been stated by you at
the bar?</P> 
<P>A. They entertained a very high opinion of General Burgoyne's
conduct.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">52.</NOTE>Q. Had General Burgoyne the full
confidence of the army under his command to the last moment?</P> 
<P>A. He certainly had.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">53.</NOTE>Q. What was the army's opinion of
the rebels after their retreat from Ticonde∣roga?</P> 
<P>A. The army in general did not think, after they had evacuated
Ticonderoga, that they would make a stand any where.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">54.</NOTE>Q. What was the reason given in
your army for the expedition to Bennington?</P>

<P>It was endeavoured, among other objects, by the
expedition which marched to the left, to provide such a supply of cattle as
would have enabled the army to proceed without waiting the arrival of the
magazines. That attempt having failed of success, through the chances of
war, the troops must necessarily halt some days for bringing forward
the transports.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">55.</NOTE>Q. Why did the army remain from
the 16th of August to the 13th of September, before they crossed the
Hudson's River to engage the rebels as Stillwater?</P> 
<P>Q. To bring forward a sufficient quantity of provisions
and artillery, to enable the general to give up his communication.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">56.</NOTE>Q. What was the opinion of the
army on their crossing the Hudson's River? </P> 
<P>A. They did think it was their indispensible duty to
proceed forward and fight the rebels, which we heard were then at
Stillwater.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">57.</NOTE>Q. Did you ever forage to the
right of General Fraser's camp before the 7th of August?</P> 
<P>A. We never foraged to the right of the camp at Freeman's
Farm, at any one time; on the 7th of October, while the troops were in the
field, General Fraser ordered all the batmen and drivers, belonging to his
brigade, to come and forage in the rear of the troops.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">58.</NOTE>Q. Do you know what was General
Fraser's opinion on your foraging to the right?</P> 
<P>A. I do know that General Fraser mentioned to me, on the 5th
of October, that there was forage on the right of his camp; but at that time
the ground on which that forage was to be met with was in possession of
the rebels' advanced post.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">59.</NOTE>Q. Do you think your army would
have been lost, if even the expedition from New York had taken place a few
days sooner?</P> 
<P>A. If the troops had arrived at New York soon enough to have
enabled Sir Henry Clinton to have made his expedition up the North River a week
sooner, I do conceive that our army would not have been lost.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">60.</NOTE>Q. What was the opinion of the
rebels on Sir William Howe's going to the southward.</P> 
<P>A. I was not acquainted enough with the rebel leaders, to hear
their opinion on that question. I do not think that the peasants of the
country were judges of the propriety of Sir William Howe's conduct.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">61.</NOTE>Q. What was the opinion of the
officers of General Burgoyne's army, after it was lost, relative to the
crossing Hudson's River.</P> 
<P>A. They did think that the alternative of retreating with
their army to Ca∣nada, or proceeding to Stillwater, under the necessity of
giving up his commu∣nication, to be an unfortunate situation; but I never
heard any officers say that they thought General Burgoyne had done wrong;
many said, that if they had re∣treated without risking an action, at the
time Sir Henry Clinton was coming up the North River, the army would never have
forgiven him, nor would he ever have forgiven himself.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">62.</NOTE>Q. Was you at New York after the
loss of General Burgoyne's army? </P> 
<P><PB N="46" REF="53"/>A. Yes.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">63.</NOTE>Q. What was the opinion or the
language of the military at that place, relative to Sir William Howe's
expedition to Pensylvania?</P> 
<P>A. Whatever opinion was formed of Sir William Howe's
expedition to Pensyl∣vania, or is formed previous to this enquiry, such an
opinion must have been ill∣founded, as Sir William Howe's reasons were not
known, nor his instructions com∣municated to the public.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">64.</NOTE>Q. From your last answer, is
the committee to understand that the opinions that were formed respecting
Sir William Howe's expedition to Philadelphia, before this enquiry, were not in
favour of that expedition?</P> 
<P>Question objected to.</P></Q><STAGE>[Withdrew.</STAGE></P>
<P> <HI>Again called in.</HI> 
<Q> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">65.</NOTE>Q. You have said that the army
thought it their indispensible duty to pass over Hudson's
River—Why did they think that that measure was particularly their
in∣dispensible duty?</P> 
<P>A. If the Hudson's River had not been there, the army would
have thought it their indispensible duty to have gone and risked an
action before they returned to Canada. If I recollect right, I said, that if
the army had returned to Canada, without fighting, that the army would never
have forgiven the general, nor the general have forgiven himself.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">66.</NOTE>Q. Do you know the nature of the
country, between the place where we passed the Hudson's River and Albany,
on the east side of the river?</P> 
<P>A. Yes, I do.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">67.</NOTE>Q. Could the army have taken that
route, in order to pass the river opposite or near to Albany?</P> 
<P>A. The army could not have taken that route, as part of the
way was a swamp, and on the right of the rebel entrenchments was a mountain
very rugged, and not passable nearer than two miles from the river.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">68.</NOTE>Q. Was it not a necessary
consequence then, that the boats must have been aban∣doned, if the army had
taken that route?</P> 
<P>A. I think I have said the army could not take that route;
if the army had marched on the east of the Hudson's River, they could not
have marched near enough to have covered their provision bateaux from the
rebel force, on the west side of the river.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">69.</NOTE>Q. Did the army under General
Burgoyne, on their approach to Albany, ex∣pect a co-operation of the army under
Sir William Howe, upon the North River?</P> 
<P>A. They did; and this is the order of General Burgoyne, given
October the 3d at Freeman's Farm:</P> 
<Q> 
<TEXT LANG="eng">
<BODY>
<DIV1 TYPE="order">
<P>There is reason to be assured, that other
powerful armies are actually in co∣operation with these troops; and although
the present supply of provision is ample, it is highly desirable, to
prepare for any continuance in the field that the King's service may require,
without the delay of bringing forward further stores for <PB N="47" REF="54"/>
those purposes; the ration of bread or flour is, for the present, fixed
at one pound.</P>
</DIV1>
</BODY>
</TEXT></Q> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">70.</NOTE>Q. Are you acquainted with the
North River, from New York to Al∣bany? </P> 
<P>A. I am not.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">71.</NOTE>Q. How many days march from Fort
Edward to Albany, if no interruption from an enemy?</P> 
<P>A. I cannot answer that question, unless I am to
suppose that a bridge was ready formed for the troops to pass over, on
some part of Hudson's River, between Batten Kill and Fort Edward, or that
there were vessels ready to transport the troops over Hudson's
River.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">72.</NOTE>Q. Is the distance so great
between Fort Edward and Albany, that the army could not carry provisions with
them to support them during the march?</P> 
<P>A. Certainly Albany is not at so great a distance from
Fort Edward, but that a corps of troops might certainly carry provisions
sufficient for the march to Albany.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">73.</NOTE>Q. Was it not understood, that
if you had arrived at Albany, that the army would find plenty of provisions
there?</P> 
<P>A. It was generally believed, and I believe it myself
firmly, that if the army had got to Albany, we should have found a number of
loyal subjects, that would have joined and done every thing in their power to
have established the army at that place.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">74.</NOTE>Q. Must not the army, to march
from Fort Edward to Albany, have necessa∣rily carried a number of boats to
form a bridge to pass the river?</P> 
<P>A. There was no passing the river well without a bridge of
boats, and there were not scouls enough on that river, to make a bridge.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">75.</NOTE>Q. Would not the necessary
delay, arising from carrying forward those boats, and throwing a bridge,
fit to pass an army, have consumed more time than it was possible for
that army to subsist with such provision as they could carry with
them?</P> 
<P>A. I should think it would.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">76.</NOTE>Q. You will give the committee
what information you can, respecting a road from Fort Edward to Albany, on
the left side of the river.</P> 
<P>A. I have answered that fully.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">77.</NOTE>Q. Whether by taking a pretty
large circuit, the army would have reached Al∣bany, and avoided the swamps
you mentioned?</P> 
<P>A. Certainly not on the east side of the river, because
the enemy being on the op∣posite shore, would certainly have opposed
General Burgoyne's army crossing the Hudson's River at Albany, the river
being three times the width it is at Sara∣toga.</P> </Q><STAGE>[Withdrew.</STAGE></P>

<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<P>EARL OF HARRINGTON called in and examined by General Burgoyne.

<Q> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">1.</NOTE>Q. IN what capacity did your
Lordship serve in America in the campaign 1777?</P> 
<P>A. I was captain in the 29th regiment of foot, and went on the
expedition with General Burgoyne, with the command of the grenadier company; I
was after∣wards appointed supernumerary aid du camp to the general.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">2.</NOTE>Q. While acting as captain of the
grenadier company, was you at the action of Huberton?</P> 
<P>A. I was.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">3.</NOTE>Q. What was the behaviour of the
enemy on that day?</P> 
<P>A. They behaved in the beginning of the action, with a great
deal of spirit; but on the British troops rushing on them with their
bayonets, they gave way in great confusion.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">4.</NOTE>Q. From the nature of the country,
was it practicable to pursue the enemy fur∣ther than they were pursued on
that occasion?</P> 
<P>A. Certainly not.—I think we ran some risque even in
pursuing them so far.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">5.</NOTE>Q. At what time of the campaign
was it that General Burgoyne requested your Lordship to act as his aid du
camp?</P> 
<P>A. I think about the 12th of July.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">6.</NOTE>Q. Was you present a few days
after that time, at a council held with the Indi∣ans of the remote nations,
then just arrived, under the conduct of Major Camp∣bell and Mr. St. Luc?</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">7.</NOTE>A. Yes.</P> 
<P>Q. Was you present at a former council of the Indians held
at Lake Champlain?</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">8.</NOTE>A. Yes.</P> 
<P>Q. What was the tenor of General Burgoyne's speeches and
injunctions at both those councils respecting the restraint of
barbarities?</P> 
<P>A. He absolutely forbid their scalping, except their dead
prisoners, which they insisted on doing, and he held out rewards to them
for bringing in prisoners, and enjoined them to treat them well.</P> 
<P><PB N="49" REF="56"/><NOTE PLACE="marg">9.</NOTE>Q. Do you
remember being with General Burgoyne, soon after the last council, upon a
visit to an out post near Fort Anne?</P> 
<P>A. I perfectly recollect it.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">10.</NOTE>Q. Had General Burgoyne a
considerable escort of Indians with him? </P> 
<P>A. He had.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">11.</NOTE>Q. Did part of that escort, on
a scout from that post, fall in with and take a part of the enemy, who were
laid in ambush for the purpose of killing or taking the general, and
those who were with him?</P> 
<P>A. They did.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">12.</NOTE>Q. What were the sentiments of
the captain taken on that occasion respecting his treatment from the
Indians?</P> 
<P>A. He said he was treated with much humanity, and I
perfectly remember that prisoners brought in on many other occasions by the
Indians, declared that they had been used with the same degree of
humanity.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">13.</NOTE>Q. Does your Lordship remember
General Burgoyne's receiving at Fort Anne, the news of the murder of Miss
M'Rea?</P> 
<P>A. I do.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">14.</NOTE>Q. Did General Burgoyne repair
immediately to the Indian camp, and call them to council, assisted by
Brigadier General Fraser?</P> 
<P>A. He did.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">15.</NOTE>Q. What passed at that
council? </P> 
<P>A. General Burgoyne threatened the culprit with death,
insisted that he should be delivered up; and there were many gentlemen of
the army, and I own I was one of the number, who feared that he would put that
threat in execution. Mo∣tives of policy, I believe alone, prevented him from
it; and if he had not pardoned the man, which he did, I believe the total
defection of the Indians would have en∣sued, and the consequences, on their
return through Canada, might have been dreadful; not to speak of the weight
they would have thrown into the op∣posite scale, had they gone over to the
enemy, which I rather imagine would have been the case.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">16.</NOTE>Q. Do you remember General
Burgoyne's restraining the Indian parties from going out without a British
officer or proper conductor, who were to be respon∣sible for their
behaviour?</P> 
<P>A. I do.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">17.</NOTE>Q. Do you remember Mr. St. Luc's
reporting discontents amongst the Indians, soon after our arrival at Fort
Edward?</P> 
<P>A. I do.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">18.</NOTE>Q. How long was that after
enforcing the restraints above mentioned? </P> 
<P>A. I can't exactly say; I should imagine about three weeks
or a month.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">19.</NOTE>Q. Does your Lordship recollect
General Burgoyne's telling Mr. St. Luc, that he had rather lose every Indian,
than connive at their enormities, or using lan∣guage to that effect?</P> 
<P>A. I do.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">20.</NOTE>Q. Does your Lordship remember
what passed in council with the Indians at Fort Edward?</P> 
<P><PB N="50" REF="57"/>A. To the best of my recollection, much
the same exhortation to act with huma∣nity, and much the same rewards were
offered for saving their prisoners.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">21.</NOTE>Q. Do you recollect the
circumstance of the Indians desiring to return home at that time?</P> 
<P>A. I do, perfectly well.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">22.</NOTE>Q. Do you remember that many
quitted the army without leave?</P> 
<P>A. I do, immediately after the council, and the next
morning.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">23.</NOTE>Q. Was it not the general opinion
that the defection of the Indians, then and afterwards, was caused by the
restraint upon their cruelties and habits of plun∣der?</P> 
<P>A. It was.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">24.</NOTE>Q. Had you reason to believe
that the expedition to Bennington was much desired by General Reidesel, and
that it was his wish to have it conducted by Lieu∣tenant Colonel Baume?</P> 
<P>A. It was always imagined in the army, that it was his wish,
and that Colonel Baume was appointed to the command of it in compliment to
him.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">25.</NOTE>Q. Did you know the corps of
British, commanded by Captain Fraser, which made part of that
expedition?</P> 
<P>A. They were volunteers from the British regiments, and
also stood very high in the opinion of the army, from their gallant
behaviour on all occasions.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">26.</NOTE>Q. Do you remember General
Burgoyne's visiting the detachment after it was assembled, and conferring
with Colonel Baume?</P> 
<P>A. I do.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">27.</NOTE>Q. Did Colonel Baume appear
satisfied with the strength of his corps?</P> 
<P>A. I conversed with Colonel Baume, and with several
officers under his command, and they appeared perfectly satisfied, at least
I heard no complaint from them; the only anxiety they expressed was, lest
the destination of that corps should become known to the enemy.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">28.</NOTE>Q. Does your Lordship remember
General Burgoyne's receiving, in the night, a letter from Lieutenant Colonel
Baume, expressing he found the enemy in greater force than he expected?</P>

<P>A. I do.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">29.</NOTE>Q. Do you remember Sir Francis
Clarke, General Burgoyne's aid du camp, being sent with orders to Colonel
Breyman to march immediately to support him?</P> 
<P>A. I do.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">30.</NOTE>Q. Did you communicate the same
order to General Reidesel at the same time?</P> 
<P>A. I did.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">31.</NOTE>Q. Was Colonel Breyman the
nearest corps for the purpose of that support?</P> 
<P>A. It was.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">32.</NOTE>Q. Did Brigadier General Fraser
at all times treat your Lordship with great confidence?</P> 
<P><PB N="51" REF="58"/>A. I was often with General Fraser, and
he frequently talked without reserve upon matters which he was not
particularly bound to conceal. There were certain matters of intelligence which
it would have been improper for him to mention to any body. In this case I
cannot boast so much of his confidence, as to suppose that he would
have opened his mind to me on matters which he would have concealed from the
rest of his friends.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">33.</NOTE>Q. Have you not frequently been
present when General Burgoyne and General Fraser discussed the object
of the campaign, and conversed freely on the circumstances of the time?</P>

<P>A. I have.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">34.</NOTE>Q. Did your Lordship ever, in
presence or absence of General Burgoyne, hear Ge∣neral Fraser express a
disapprobation of passing the Hudson's River?</P> 
<P>A. I never did?</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">35.</NOTE>Q. Do you know or believe that
the idea of forcing our way to Albany was pre∣valent throughout the army?</P> 
<P>A. In every conversation I had with different officers of
the army, I never remem∣ber once to have heard it doubted, but that we were to
force our way.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">36.</NOTE>Q. Did the army pass the
Hudson's River with alacrity? </P> 
<P>A. It is impossible for any army to have been in higher
spirits than they were at that time, or more desirous of coming to an
engagement with the enemy.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">37.</NOTE>Q. Do you not conceive, that to
have remained posted behind the Hudson's River, at the time the army
passed it and advanced, would have cast a damp on the spirits of that
army and a reflection on their General?</P> 
<P>A. From the eagerness of the army to advance and the great
uneasiness that was discernible through it on every delay, I apprehended
that it could not have been otherwise; and I think that General Burgoyne's
character would not have stood very high either with the army, this country,
or the enemy, had he halted at Fort Edward.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">38.</NOTE>Q. Do you recollect the march up
to the enemy on the 19th of Septem∣ber? </P> 
<P>A. I do.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">39.</NOTE>Q. Will you please to
describe it? </P> 
<P>A. The army marched in three divisions; the German line
flanking, the artillery and baggage pursued the course of the river through
the meadows, and formed the left hand division; the British line marched
parallel to it at some distance through the woods, and formed the centre
division; General Fraser's corps, with the grena∣diers and light infantry
of the Germans, were obliged to make a large detour through the woods, and
formed the right hand division or column. Beyond this, on the right, there
were, as I understand, flanking parties of light infantry and
Provin∣cials?</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">40.</NOTE>Q. Was the country, over which
the army passed, intersected with a deep ravine?</P> 
<P>A. It was one of the deepest I ever saw.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">41.</NOTE>Q. Which column was first
attacked? </P> 
<P>A. The advanced party, consisting of the picquets of the
centre column, being sent <PB N="52" REF="59"/> forwards, under the command of
Major Forbes, to explore the way by which that column was to pass, fell in
with a considerable body of the rebels, posted in a house and behind
fences, which they attacked, and after a great deal of fire, the detach∣ment
nearly drove in the body of rebels; but on finding that the woods quite round
them were filled with the enemy, they were obliged to retire to the main
body.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">42.</NOTE>Q. Was the march so performed
that when General Burgoyne formed the line of the British infantry, General
Fraser's corps were ready upon their right to support them?</P> 
<P>A. General Fraser, on hearing the fire of Major Forbes's
party, detached two com∣panies to support them, which came up just after
that engagement was over; and on their appearance the enemy finding that our
troops were in strength, quitted the post they had before occupied, and,
immediately after this, the whole line was formed with the utmost regularity.
I would explain, that when I speak of the line, I do not include the left
hand column which was composed of Germans, and which did not come into the
line or into action till late in the day.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">43.</NOTE>Q. How long did the action
last?</P> 
<P>A. From three o'clock, I think, till very near eight.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">44.</NOTE>Q. How long were the 20th,
21st, and 62d regiments engaged?</P> 
<P>A. During the greatest part of that time.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">45.</NOTE>Q. Was the action well disputed
by the enemy?</P> 
<P>A. It was, very obstinately.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">46.</NOTE>Q. Was your Lordship near the
person of General Burgoyne during that action, except when you were employed
to carry orders?</P> 
<P>A. Yes.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">47.</NOTE>Q. Were not different attempts
made by the General's orders to charge the enemy with bayonets, and did not
those attempts fail by the heaviness of the enemy's fire and thickness of
the woods?</P> 
<P>A. There were many attempts made for that purpose, and they
all failed except the last, when the British troops finally drove them out
of the field.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">48.</NOTE>Q. When part of the German troops
did get into action that day under General Reidesel, how did they behave?</P>

<P>A. I heard their behaviour spoke of in the highest terms;
they marched up to the enemy with great coolness and steadiness, and gave
them, as I was told, three vollies by word of command from their officers.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">49.</NOTE>Q. Can your Lordship speak to
the loss sustained by the three British regiments, the 62d in
particular?</P> 
<P>A. The loss was very considerable; but I don't recollect
the numbers.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">50.</NOTE>Q. Were those three British
regiments in a condition to have attacked the enemy the next morning?</P> 
<P>A. Their numbers were so reduced, that I apprehend they were
not.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">51.</NOTE>Q. From the loss of killed and
wounded, particularly of officers, would it have been desirable to have
brought those three regiments into action for the next ten days?</P> 
<P>A. In less than ten days the state of those regiments
certainly would not have <PB N="53" REF="60"/> been much mended; I therefore
apprehend, that if they were not in a condition to be brought into action the
next morning, their inability would have still continued for those ten
days.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">52.</NOTE>Q. Had the army made a movement
to gain the left of the enemy's entrench∣ments before the redoubts were
constructed that commanded the plain near the river, would not all the
bateaux, stores, and hospitals have been exposed to attack?</P> 
<P>A. It certainly would have been so.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">53.</NOTE>Q. Do you recollect the
scarcity of forage on the west-side of the river? </P> 
<P>A. I do perfectly.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">54.</NOTE>Q. Would not the bridge of boats,
constructed for the purpose of foraging to the east side, have also
been exposed before the redoubts, above mentioned, were raised?</P> 
<P>A. They certainly would, had it not been for those redoubts
and a work called the <HI>Tête du pont,</HI> which was raised for the
protection of the bridge.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">55.</NOTE>Q. Do you recollect how long it
took to raise those redoubts, to throw the bridge, and raise the
<HI>Tête du pont?</HI></P> 
<P>A. If I recollect right, the bridge itself was finished in
one night; the making and compleating the other works took some days.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">56.</NOTE>Q. Does your Lordship remember
General Burgoyne mentioning to you in confidence, the receipt of a letter from
Sir Henry Clinton, and his hourly ex∣pectation of his attacking the Highlands,
and his opinion that his success there must dislodge the enemy without
attacking their entrenchments?</P> 
<P>A. I perfectly recollect the General's mentioning all this to
me.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">57.</NOTE>Q. Was you near General Burgoyne
in the action of the 7th of October? </P> 
<P>A. I was.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">58.</NOTE>Q. Do you recollect what orders
you carried? </P> 
<P>A. I do.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">59.</NOTE>Q. What were they? </P> 
<P>A. The first orders I recollect to have carried, were to
post fifty men under the command of a captain of the 20th regiment, to the
left of the detachment of the army, in order, in some measure, to join them
to the advanced works of General Fraser's camp, and, in case of any
accident, to protect the detachment, should they find it necessary, to
retire thither.</P> 
<P>The next orders I carried were to Major General Phillips, at
the end of the action, acquainting him, that as that detachment seemed much
disordered from the enemy having turned both their flanks, that it was
necessary to draw it as soon as possible back to the camp, which
seemed menaced with an attack; the care of this General Burgoyne committed to
General Phillips, while he himself returned to the camp, in order to take
proper measures for its defence. On our return thither the works of the camp
were actually attacked as General Burgoyne had foreseen, and I was then
em∣ployed to collect what troops I should meet, and to order them to those
parts where they were most wanted. Soon after this, the enemy having got
round the right of our camp, we expected an attack upon our rear, and I then
was dispatched with orders from General Burgoyne to Brigadier General
Hamilton, for all the works in <PB N="54" REF="61"/> the rear of the camp, which
had been previously constructed, to be manned with such soldiers as he
could spare from the defence of the front.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">60.</NOTE> Q Does your Lordship know what
orders Sir Francis Clarke was charged with, at the time he received his
wound?</P> 
<P>A. I met Sir Francis Clarke as I was searching for General
Phillips, and ac∣quainted him with my orders, telling him at the same time,
that as the thick∣ness of the wood might prevent my finding General Phillips
directly, I wished he would assist me, in order that no time might be
lost in delivering those orders; that was the last time I saw Sir
Francis Clarke, and I believe that soon afterwards he re∣ceived the wound of
which he died?</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">61.</NOTE>Q. Was it dark before General
Burgoyne had a certainty that Col. Breyman was killed, and his post carried
by the enemy?</P> 
<P>A. It was so dark that the officer, who I believe first
brought the intelligence of it, seeing a number of men round the fires of
that camp, took them for Germans, and was not convinced of his error till he
was fired upon by them, as they proved to be a party of the enemy who had
forced the works.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">62.</NOTE>Q. Did General Burgoyne use any
efforts to rally the Germans who were returning from the action, and to
persuade them to recover Colonel Breyman's post?</P> 
<P>A. He certainly did his utmost endeavours for that
purpose, which however were ineffectual from the darkness of the night, and
the entire confusion in which they were.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">63.</NOTE>Q. Were any other troops at hand
that could have been spared for that pur∣pose?</P> 
<P>A. There certainly were not; every regiment was occupied in
defence of its own lines which were not certainly overmanned.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">64.</NOTE>Q. In the heat of the action do
you recollect seeing General Reidesel about the time that the Germans, on
the left of the British artillery, were giving way?</P> 
<P>A. I do.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">65.</NOTE>Q. Was not General Reidesel
exerting himself to restore order in his troops?</P> 
<P>A. General Reidesel appeared to me to have behaved, on that
occasion, in every way as became a brave and intelligent officer.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">66.</NOTE>Q. Was the retreat of the army in
the night of the 7th made in good order, and a new position taken by the time
it was day-light?</P> 
<P>A. It certainly was.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">67.</NOTE>Q. Was the army under arms the
whole day of the 8th, and in continual expecta∣tion of action?</P> 
<P>A. They were, and indeed were cannonaded during the greatest
part of that day, and the advanced corps in particular, who were posted on a
hill, were under almost a continual fire from the riflemen of the enemy.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">68.</NOTE>Q. Do you recollect the
circumstance of General Fraser's funeral on the afternoon of that day?</P> 
<P>A. I do, perfectly well; the redoubt in which he was buried
was very heavily cannonaded during the ceremony, and even previous to this they
fired at those who <PB N="55" REF="62"/> attended the corpse on its way
thither, which I suppose was accidental, and pro∣ceeded from the enemy's
seeing a number of people together.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">69.</NOTE>Q. Who were the chief persons
who attended that funeral? </P> 
<P>A. All the generals of the army, their aid du camps, and I
believe all those who were not attached to any particular post, which at
that time were very few.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">70.</NOTE>Q. Was the retreat of the army on
the night of the 8th, and on the day and part of the night of the 9th, made in
good order?</P> 
<P>A. It was made in perfect good order.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">71.</NOTE>Q. What was the weather on the
day of the 9th? </P> 
<P>A. Exceeding wet. </P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">72.</NOTE>Q. What was the state of the
troops, in point of fatigue, when they arrived at Saratoga?</P> 
<P>A. They certainly must have been much fatigued, from the
length of time they had been under arms, and more particularly so from the
badness of the roads, occa∣sioned by the rains.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">73.</NOTE>Q. When it was day-light the next
morning, did you see any part of the enemy upon the plain at Saratoga, on the
ground where our artillery was afterwards posted?</P> 
<P>A. I don't recollect.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">74.</NOTE>Q. Does your Lordship recollect
seeing a corps of the enemy on the other side the Hudson's River
opposite to Saratoga?</P> 
<P>A. Perfectly well; and they seemed in force.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">75.</NOTE>Q. Do you remember the
circumstance of a battery opening from that corps? </P> 
<P>A. I do perfectly well. The general, General Phillips, and
several other gentle∣men were at dinner. We were all obliged to remove, from
finding ourselves in the range of that battery.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">76.</NOTE>Q. We being in the range of that
battery, must it not necessarily have com∣manded the ford on the
Hudson's River?</P> 
<P>A. It certainly did command that ford.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">77.</NOTE>Q. Do you recollect Lieut. Col.
Sutherland being sent with a detachment of regulars and provincials from
Saratoga, to cover a party of workmen employed to repair bridges, and render
the road practicable?</P> 
<P>A. I perfectly recollect it.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">78.</NOTE>Q. Do you recollect for what
reason Colonel Sutherland and the regulars were re∣called? </P> 
<P>A. I understood it was on the apprehension of an
action.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">79.</NOTE>Q. Does your Lordship recollect
different scouts bringing reports of the enemy's being in possession
of the country between Saratoga and Fort Edward, on both sides of the
river?</P> 
<P>A. I do.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">80.</NOTE>Q. Do you remember General
Burgoyne's mentioning, in confidence to you, dif∣ferent ideas of forcing the
ford over Hudson's River; of cutting away by the ene∣my's right, and
attempting a rapid march to Albany; or by a night march to gain the fords above
Fort Edward?</P> 
<P>A. I do perfectly remember that he mentioned to me all those
ideas.</P> 
<P><PB N="56" REF="63"/><NOTE PLACE="marg">81.</NOTE>Q. Did you
ever hear of an offer made by General Phillips to make his way to Ticonderoga
with a body of troops?</P> 
<P>A. No.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">82.</NOTE>Q. In the intimacy in which you
lived with Major General Phillips, myself, and the officers in General
Phillips's family, do you not think you should have heard of such an offer
had it been made?</P> 
<P>A. I apprehend that I should have heard of it.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">83.</NOTE>Q. Did your Lordship hear of
General Phillips offering to attempt an escape through the woods, with one or
two guides, for the purpose of putting himself at the head of the troops at
Ticonderoga, for the future defence of that place?</P> 
<P>A. I heard it mentioned since I came to England, in some
common conversa∣tion; but I never heard it hinted at while I was in
America.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">84.</NOTE>Q. The day before the council of
the generals and field officers was called, can your Lordship speak of the
state of things in general at Saratoga?</P> 
<P>A. The state of our army was certainly as bad as
possible. Their numbers were few, their provisions short, and their
position not a good one, owing to the nature of the country, which rose to
the distance of some miles, one hill overtopping that which was next to
it.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">85.</NOTE>Q. Do you know any officer of
that army who, in that situation, thought we had a right to more than
honourable terms?</P> 
<P>A. Our situation, in the apprehension of every one there
with whom I conversed, did not entitle us to more.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">86.</NOTE>Q. Did the army in general look
on the terms obtained, namely, the power of serving their country in other
places, to be advantageous as well as honourable, and more than they had a
right to expect?</P> 
<P>A. I believe they certainly did; and that few persons in the
army expected so good terms as those which were granted.</P></Q></P>
<P> <HI>Examined by other Members of the Committee, and by
General Burgoyne occasionally.</HI> 
<Q> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">87.</NOTE>Q. Did the Indians leave the army
till after the battle of Bennington?</P> 
<P>A. Great numbers did, and at many different times.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">88.</NOTE>Q. Were not some Indians on the
expedition to Bennington?</P> 
<P>A. There were.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">89.</NOTE>Q. Was the expedition originally
sent out to Bennington?</P> 
<P>A. My situation in the army not entitling me to be in the
council of war, and not being employed on that expedition, I was of course
not entrusted with the orders that were given to Col. Baume.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">90.</NOTE>Q. Have you reason to
suppose that General Reidesel or Colonel Baume had a par∣ticular
knowledge of that part of the country, so as to make it particularly proper
to give Colonel Baume the command of that expedition?</P> 
<P>A. I believe there was no officer in that army of sufficient
rank to have com∣manded such an expedition, who ever had been in that
particular part of the country.</P> 
<P><PB N="57" REF="64"/><NOTE PLACE="marg">91.</NOTE>Q. The
intention of the expedition being, as appears by the papers on the table, to
sound the disposition of the people of that country, was that part of the
coun∣try peopled with Germans, as many other parts of the country are?</P> 
<P>A. I can't exactly speak to the description of the people
of that country, as I was never there myself; but there were employed on that
expedition numbers of provincials, many of whom were of that very country; and
I apprehend that the common soldiers of a regular army are not the immediate
people who are expected to sound the minds of any country to which they are
sent.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">92.</NOTE>Q. As your Lordship mentioned
the alacrity with which the army passed the Hudson's River, did the army
in general think themselves at that time inadequate to the purpose of
forcing their way to Albany?</P> 
<P>A. The opinions of an army, who cannot be acquainted with the
intelligence that has been received, are often erroneous. The army was in high
spirits, and did not, I believe, doubt of reaching Albany.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">93.</NOTE>Q. Did the General then doubt of
reaching Albany? </P> 
<P>A. I really don't know.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">94.</NOTE>Q. Were the rebels' entrenchments
completed on the 19th of September? </P> 
<P>A. I never saw the entrenchments at all.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">95.</NOTE>Q. How was our army employed
between the 19th of September and the 7th of October?</P> 
<P>A. The army itself was employed in strengthening its
position.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">96.</NOTE>Q. Did it take the army eighteen
days to strengthen its position before it made any movement?</P> 
<P>A. I can't exactly say. They were working all the time.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">97.</NOTE>Q. What works were executed in
that time? </P> 
<P>A. There were numbers of redoubts erected; the
tête-du-pont; lines before the camp; outworks to the lines, in which
guards and picquets were placed; and bat∣teries.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">98.</NOTE>Q. How many redoubts were
erected? </P> 
<P>A. I think in all there must have been five or six.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">99.</NOTE>Q. Was the erecting those works
full employment for eighteen days? </P> 
<P>A. I am not an engineer, or I certainly should endeavour to
answer that question.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">100.</NOTE>Q. Were all those works
necessary, in your opinion, for an army that meant to march forward and
attack the enemy?</P> 
<P>A. They were necessary in our particular situation,
being within half a mile of the enemy, to whom we were opposed, and being
inferior in numbers.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">101.</NOTE>Q. Does your Lordship know
whether the enemy thought it necessary to fortify themselves with
redoubts?</P> 
<P>A. I don't know what the species of their fortification was;
but I have been always told that great labour had been employed on their works;
and what small part I saw of them convinced me of it.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">102.</NOTE>Q. Had you not information from
deserters or friends what the enemy was doing?</P> 
<P>A. My situation in that army did not entitle me to receive
that intelligence. When any person came to me to inform me that he had been
employed in gaining such in∣telligence, my duty was to bring him to the
General.</P> 
<P><PB N="58" REF="65"/><NOTE PLACE="marg">103.</NOTE>Q. Was it
not a matter of notoriety in the army, that the enemy received reinforce∣ment
between the 19th of September and the 7th of October?</P> 
<P>A. The manner of receiving intelligence in an army seldom
transpires; the army might guess, but I believe they knew nothing.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">104.</NOTE>Q. Was it not understood that
the rebels had suffered a much greater loss than the king's troops on the
19th of September?</P> 
<P>A. It was.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">105.</NOTE>Q. Was not the whole, or nearly
the whole, of the rebel army engag ed?</P> 
<P>A. I don't know; I apprehend the whole was not engaged.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">106.</NOTE>Q. Was our army in general, in
your apprehension, in as good a condition on the 20th of September as the
rebel army, who had suffered much more?</P> 
<P>A. The rebel army was so numerous that their loss was not
equally felt with ours.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">107.</NOTE>Q. What number had you reason
to suppose the rebel army consisted of on the 19th of September?</P> 
<P>A. I always understood they were very numerous. I never
heard their numbers exactly.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">108.</NOTE>Q. Was not the scarcity of
forage foreseen by every body?</P> 
<P>A. Those with whom I conversed did not foresee it to the
extent in which we expe∣rienced it.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">109.</NOTE>Q. Was it prudent, in your
Lordship's opinion, to bring, or attempt to bring, up∣wards of fourteen
hundred horses to attend the army, in a country so destitute of
forage?</P> 
<P>A. I never heard that the horses in our army were thought
too numerous. On all occasions a scarcity of them was complained of.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">110.</NOTE>Q. Do you know how many horses
were allowed for the baggage of each regiment?</P> 
<P>A. I don't know.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">111.</NOTE>Q. Does your Lordship know how
many horses were employed about the train of artillery?</P> 
<P>A. I don't recollect; but the returns are on the table.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">112.</NOTE>Q. Was the heavy artillery
brought back from Stillwater, on the retreat of the army to Saratoga?</P> 
<P>A. We had lost some small part of it, and the rest was
brought to Saratoga.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">113.</NOTE>Q. Did the bringing back of that
artillery delay that retreat or not?</P> 
<P>A. An army with cannon certainly cannot march so rapidly as
one without cannon; but cannon always creates a delay which armies have been
content to put up with.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">114.</NOTE>Q. Was it necessary, in your
opinion, in the situation in which the army retreated, to make their retreat
as expeditious as possible?</P> 
<P>A. The army appeared to me that it did make its retreat as
expeditious as pos∣sible.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">115.</NOTE>Q. Would the leaving of heavy
artillery behind, in your opinion, have made a difference of four miles in the
march?</P> 
<P>A. I can't conceive that it would. The enemy were in force
behind us; not having numbers to contend with them, it would have been a very
desperate circum∣stance to have abandoned our cannon, in case of an
attack.</P> 
<P><PB N="59" REF="66"/><NOTE PLACE="marg">116.</NOTE>Q. Were the
heavy artillery, in effect, of any use in that retreat?</P> 
<P>A. I don't recollect as it happened, that they were of any
other use than that of their not being turned against us.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">117.</NOTE>Q. Might not those cannon have
been spiked, and their trunnions have been knocked off, to have rendered them
useless?</P> 
<P>A. I understand that the spikes in cannon are easily
removed, and that it is not an easy matter, I believe almost an
impossibility, with any tools that are carried in an army, to knock off the
trunnions of brass cannon.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">118.</NOTE>Q. Might not the retreat have
been accelerated by leaving behind a great part of the baggage?</P> 
<P>A. I don't think it would. I do not remember that we were
stopt on account of any particular impediment.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">119.</NOTE>Q. Does your Lordship know at
what time intelligence was received in General Burgoyne's army of the failure
of Colonel St. Leger's expedition?</P> 
<P>A. I think it must have been in the month of August.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">120.</NOTE>Q. Was not that before the
passing of Hudson's River? </P> 
<P>A. I don't recollect the exact date of receiving that
intelligence.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">121.</NOTE>Q. Was it in the month of
August? </P> 
<P>A. I cannot tell. I heard of it some time after by
accident.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">122.</NOTE>Q. Was there any heavy artillery
with the army, properly so called? </P> 
<P>A There was none of the heavy sort; we had medium
twelve-pounders, and two twenty-four pounders, which we took from the enemy at
Quebec, which were very much lighter than those twelve-pounders.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">123. By Gen. Bur∣goyne.</NOTE>Q. From the
state of the fatigue of the troops, when they arrived at Saratoga, do you
apprehend they could have continued their march though there had been no
artillery?</P> 
<P>A. The army was certainly very much fatigued. I believe they
could have got but very little further. They certainly were not in a state
for a long march.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">124. By General Burgoyne.</NOTE>Q. If the
battle expected at Saratoga had been on the plain, would not the heaviest
artillery we had have been one of our best dependencies?</P> 
<P>A. It certainly would; it would have given us a manifest
superiority in that particular.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">125. By General Burgoyne.</NOTE>Q. If the
army had not been provided with the number of horses they had, by what means
would their provisions or bateaux have been transported in places where the
river was not navigable?</P> 
<P>A. The transportation of the bateaux and provisions could
not certainly have been carried on.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">126. By General Burgoyne.</NOTE>Q. Were
there not such places on the Hudson's River between Fort Edward and
Albany?</P> 
<P>A. There were.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">127. By other members.</NOTE>Q. Is it not
at any rate a principal object with every army, and of a retreating one in
particular, to preserve their artillery if it be possible, even at the
expence of some labour and delay; and for the use they might be of to them
afterwards, as well as on the retreat?</P> 
<P><PB N="60" REF="67"/>A. I apprehend the cannon are seldom
abandoned, but through absolute ne∣cessity.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">128.</NOTE>Q. Whether in general you can
inform the committee, whether the army had a confidence in the general?</P> 
<P>A. They certainly had a confidence in the general, and I do
not believe that they have altered their opinion.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">129.</NOTE>Q. Did the army then in general,
and the officers in particular, entertain a favourable opinion of the general's
conduct, capacity, and attachment to them in the various scenes in which he
was engaged, and more particularly on very trying occasions?</P> 
<P>A. I don't recollect that any officer, with whom I have had
conversation, has ever expressed himself in different terms, and I
believe there never was an army more deservedly pleased with the conduct of
their general.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">130.</NOTE>Q. Whether the army
expressed any dissatisfaction at the general's return home; that is,
whether they thought he came with any purposes not friendly to them, or
looked on themselves as deserted by him?</P> 
<P>A. I was not with the army when General Burgoyne came away;
but I have conversed with many officers who have come from it, and they
express no dis∣satisfaction on that head, much less looked on or
considered General Burgoyne's intentions as inimical to them.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">131.</NOTE>Q. What was the state of the
American artillery, and how was it served?</P> 
<P>A. Except on a few occasions, I do not remember their having
made much use of their cannon; I thought on those occasions that they
served them slowly, but not ill.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">132.</NOTE>Q. Whether all circumstances
considered at the time of the affair of Saratoga, the retreat of the army was
practicable, either with or without artillery?</P> 
<P>A. I thought it was impracticable.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">133.</NOTE>Q. Whether after the convention
at Saratoga you went to Albany?</P> 
<P>A. Yes.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">134.</NOTE>Q. Whether you had any
opportunity of observing the nature of the country, if it was strong or
woody, clear or open?</P> 
<P>A. Very strong and woody, and a great number of hills.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">135.</NOTE>Q. What was the distance?</P> 
<P>A. I don't exactly recollect; about thirty-two miles.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">136.</NOTE>Q. Was the situation of Albany
a strong situation, or was it commanded by hills round it?</P> 
<P>A. The situation of Albany was in a bottom very much
commanded.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">137.</NOTE>Q. If the army had penetrated to
Albany, from whence might they have drawn their subsistence, if the
country had been against them?</P> 
<P>A. I don't know enough of the country to answer that
question.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">138.</NOTE>Q. Must they not have drawn
their subsistence from New York?</P> 
<P>A. I apprehend so, if they were not masters of the Mohawk
country.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">139.</NOTE>Q. Had you any opportunity of
observing the extent of clear or cultivated coun∣try round Albany?</P> 
<P>A. I can't very justly describe it, not having gone out of
the town of Albany, from the time I came into it, till I embarked for New
York.</P> 
<P><PB N="61" REF="68"/><NOTE PLACE="marg">140.</NOTE>Q. Do you
think that, circumstanced as the army was after the engagement of the 19th of
September, it would have been more advantageous to have returned than to have
stayed and fortified the camp?</P> 
<P>A. As matters have turned out, it certainly might; but I
believe no one thought so at that time.</P></Q><STAGE>[Withdrew.</STAGE></P>

<P>MAJOR FORBES called in and examined by General Burgoyne. 
<Q> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">1.</NOTE>Q. WAS you major of the 9th
regiment, and present with that regiment in the action near Fort Anne?</P> 
<P>A. I was.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">2.</NOTE>Q. What was the behaviour of the
enemy on that occasion? </P> 
<P>A. At half past ten in the morning, they attacked us in
front with a heavy and well-directed fire; a large body of them passed the
creek on the left, fired from a thick wood across the creek on the left flank
of the regiment; they then began to re-cross the creek, and attack us in the
rear: we then found it necessary to change our ground, to prevent the
regiments being surrounded; we took post on the top of a high hill to our
right. As soon as we had taken post, the enemy made a very vigorous attack,
which continued for upwards of two hours; and they cer∣tainly would have forced
us, had it not been for some Indians that arrived and gave the Indian whoop,
which we answered with three cheers; the rebels soon af∣ter that gave
way.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">3.</NOTE>Q. What command had you on the
19th of September? </P> 
<P>A. I commanded the picquets of the British.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">4.</NOTE>Q. Was you attacked on the march,
and with what degree of vigour? </P> 
<P>A. I was attacked with great vigour from behind railed fences,
and a house, by a body of riflemen and light infantry.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">5.</NOTE>Q. Was you wounded in that affair?</P> 
<P>A. Very early in the day.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">6.</NOTE>Q. Do you remember General
Burgoyne bringing up the British line to sup∣port you, and forming at the
first opening of the wood?</P> 
<P>A. I do.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">7.</NOTE>Q. Did General Fraser's corps
arrive precisely in time to occupy the heights on the right of the British
line when the action began?</P> 
<P>A. It did, and two companies of light infantry came to my
support. </P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">8.</NOTE>Q. Where did General Burgoyne
post the 9th regiment?</P> 
<P><PB N="62" REF="69"/>A. As soon as they came out of the wood,
they filed off to the right, and were drawn off at a small distance from
the left of General Fraser's corps, with orders to occupy two houses, one
company in each, and defend them to the last extremity.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">9.</NOTE>Q. Had you an opportunity in that
situation to observe the stress of the action?</P> 
<P>A. I had while we remained in that position.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">10.</NOTE>Q. What was the progress of
it?</P> 
<P>A. The twenty-first and sixty-second regiments were
drawn up on our left, and were attacked about three o'clock on the same
ground where the picquets had been attacked. About that time I heard a great
deal of firing to my right with the advanced corps; an officer came up to
General Burgoyne, and acquainted him that the enemy were endeavouring to turn
the left of the sixty-second regi∣ment, on which he dispatched an
aid-de-camp with orders to the twentieth regi∣ment to form on the left of the
sixty-second; immediately after, some compa∣nies of the light infantry
came to occupy the ground the ninth were drawn up on; the ninth were then
ordered behind a deep ravine, to form a corps-de∣reserve. I saw nothing of
the action after that.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">11.</NOTE>Q. What was the strength of the
ninth regiment on that day before they sustain∣ed any loss?</P> 
<P>A. On the 15th of the month the weekly return was given in,
and, to the best of my recollection, they were two hundred and fifty and odd
rank and file fit for duty.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">12.</NOTE>Q. What was the strength of the
other regiments in the British line?</P> 
<P>A. I cannot speak with any certainty, as I did not see the
returns; but on talking with different commanding officers: the four British
regiments were about one thousand one hundred, and the advanced corps about
one thousand two hun∣dred.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">13.</NOTE>Q. Where was the twenty-fourth
regiment?</P> 
<P>A. With the advanced corps.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">14.</NOTE>Q. Where was the forty-seventh
regiment?</P> 
<P>A. Six companies of the forty-seventh regiment that were
with that army, were employed as a guard to the bateaux and provisions, and
two with the advanced corps.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">15.</NOTE>Q. Where were the other two
companies of that regiment left?</P> 
<P>A. One at Fort George, and another on an island in Lake
George.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">16.</NOTE>Q. Of the eleven hundred which
composed the line on that day, do you know how many were lost and
disabled in the action?</P> 
<P>A. I have heard the surgeon of the hospital say, that
there were more than five hundred of the whole in the hospital, but I can't
speak to how many of the line.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">17.</NOTE>Q. Can you say how many were
killed?</P> 
<P>A. I can't.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">18.</NOTE>Q. Can you say how many
officers were killed and wounded?</P> 
<P>A. I can't immediately.</P> 
<P><PB N="63" REF="70"/><NOTE PLACE="marg">19.</NOTE>Q. Were the
British troops in a condition to have attacked an enemy in in∣trenchments
after the action?</P> 
<P>A. After the action of the 19th, I went to the hospital to
get my wounds dressed, and did not join the regiment till the 8th of
October; I can't there∣fore give an opinion of my own: but I have heard
several officers say, they did not think it would have been prudent or
right from the loss they had sustained the day before.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">20.</NOTE>Q. Did the regiments begin to be
encreased in their strength from the recovered men to any considerable
degree in less than eight or ten days?</P> 
<P>A. Not that I know of. I was at the hospital at the
time.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">21.</NOTE>Q. Being in the hospital, had
you occasion to know that the regiments were stronger from the receipt of
their recovered men on the 7th of October, than they were at any time between
the 19th of September and that day?</P> 
<P>A. I know that several men were discharged from the
hospitals so far recover∣ed as to enable them to do their duty.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">22.</NOTE>Q. At what time did the troops
arrive at Saratoga? </P> 
<P>A. About eight o'clock at night on the 9th.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">23.</NOTE>Q. Do you know how long the
troops had then been under arms, and without repose or regular
refreshment?</P> 
<P>A. From the 7th in the morning.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">24.</NOTE>Q. Had they been in action, or in
continual expectation of action, during that whole time?</P> 
<P>A. I was in the front of the army, and I heard a great deal of
firing in the rear, and we constantly expected and looked for an attack.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">25.</NOTE>Q. Did the battery of the enemy
on the other side of the river at Saratoga com∣mand the fort on that
river?</P> 
<P>A. It did.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">26.</NOTE>Q. Was the ground such on our
side as would have enabled our artillery to have silenced that battery?</P>

<P>A. It did not appear to me that it could.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">27.</NOTE>Q. Had the passage of the
ford been effected, and the army have proceeded to∣wards Fort Edward, on the
east side of the river, must they not necessarily have passed
Batten Hill?</P> 
<P>A. Undoubtedly.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">28.</NOTE>Q. Do you remember the ford at
Batten-Hill? </P> 
<P>A. Yes.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">29.</NOTE>Q. Would it have been
possible for the army to have passed that ford without artillery to
cover them, and the enemy posted on the other side?</P> 
<P>A. Certainly not. I had an opportunity of seeing the
twentieth regiment pass that ford without an enemy to oppose them, and they
took a considerable time, owing to the depth of the water, the rapidity of
the current, and the stones being remarkable slippery, so that several
of them fell into the river.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">30.</NOTE>Q. Was you present at all the
councils of war to which the field officers of the army were called at
Saratoga?</P> 
<P>A. I was.</P> 
<P><PB N="64" REF="71"/><NOTE PLACE="marg">31.</NOTE>Q. Do you
remember whether General Burgoyne stated the difficulties of the time, and
that he mentioned his readiness to undertake any measure they should
think for the honour of the British arms?</P> 
<P>A. I do remember it.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">32.</NOTE>Q. Was the council unanimous to
treat with the enemy on honourable terms?</P> 
<P>A. They were.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">33.</NOTE>Q. When the first terms
proposed by General Gates were read to them, were they unanimous to reject
them?</P> 
<P>A. They were.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">34.</NOTE>Q. After it was decided by a
majority of the council that the treaty could not be suspended without
breach of faith, were not the council then unanimous to sign it on that
day?</P> 
<P>A. As the majority of the council had given it as their
opinion that the public faith was pledged, the council thought that there was
no time to be lost, and that it ought to be signed immediately.</P></Q></P>
<P> <HI>Examined by other Members of the Committee and by General
Burgoyne occasionally.</HI> 
<Q> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">35.</NOTE>Q. Do you know or apprehend that
the rebel camp was completely entrenched on the 19th of September?</P> 
<P>A. I don't know.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">36.</NOTE>Q. Had you any reason to
believe from information that they completed their en∣trenchments
afterwards?</P> 
<P>A. I understood they had—I don't speak from
authority.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">37.</NOTE>Q. Had you reason to think that
the rebels received considerable reinforcements between the 19th of September
and the 7th of October?</P> 
<P>A. I did not hear that they had.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">38.</NOTE>Q. Supposing the rebels to have
received reinforcements, could any accession of strength to our army from
the recovery of any number you can suppose of the 500 that were in the
hospital, be equal to a reinforcement of even 500 men received by the
enemy?</P> 
<P>A. I cannot take upon me to say.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">39.</NOTE>Q. From being in the hospital
yourself, how many of the 500 do you judge joined the army?</P> 
<P>A. I can't pretend to say.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">40.</NOTE>Q. Do you judge in your own
opinion, putting all the circumstances you can toge∣ther, whether the enemy
were more likely to be forced on the 20th of September or a day or two after,
than on the 7th of October?</P> 
<P>A. It is impossible for me to judge—I did not know
their strength on the 19th of September, or what reinforcements they received
before the 7th of October.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">41.</NOTE>Q. Did you apprehend the army
might have made their retreat good to Canada immediately after the action of
the 19th of September?</P> 
<P><PB N="65" REF="72"/>A. That depended entirely on
circumstances.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">42.</NOTE>Q. Judging from the
circumstances you then knew, what is your opinion? </P> 
<P>A. I was not more acquainted with the circumstances of the
19th of September than with those of the 7th of October.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">43.</NOTE>Q. If the army had had three
weeks more provisions when they began their retreat, would not that have been
a material circumstance to them towards making good their retreat?</P> 
<P>A. The army could have defended themselves longer in their
entrenchments at Sa∣ratoga if they had had more provisions.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">44. By General Burgoyne.</NOTE>Q. Had you
known, immediately after the action of the 19th of September, that a letter had
been received from Sir Henry Clinton, mentioning his intention to attack the
highlands about that time, would you have thought either a retreat or an
immediate attack on the enemy adviseable?</P> 
<P>A. Certainly not.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">45. By other Members.</NOTE>Q. Do you know
whether a council of war was called on the 20th of September, or immediately
after the engagement of the 19th of September?</P> 
<P>A. I don't know that there was.</P> 
<P>Q. Did the army in which you served, in its approach to
Albany, expect a co-ope∣ration from Sir William Howe on the North River?</P> 
<P>A. We did.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">47.</NOTE>Q. Do you believe if the army
under Sir William Howe, instead of going by sea up the Chesapeak to
Philadelphia, had operated upon the North River to effect a junction with
General Burgoyne's army, considering also the panic that prevailed after
the taking of Ticonderoga, that the army under General Burgoyne would have been
made prisoners?</P> 
<P>A. I should think not.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">48.</NOTE>Q. Did you expect any great
oppostion from the rebel army after the taking Ticonderoga?</P> 
<P>A. I did not.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">49.</NOTE>Q. Upon what grounds did you so
positively expect a co-operation with Sir Wil∣liam Howe's army?</P> 
<P>A. From General Burgoyne's orders.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">50.</NOTE>Q. Did you ever see General
Burgoyne's orders? </P> 
<P>A. Every day during the campaign.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">51.</NOTE>Q. By what orders of General
Burgoyne did you expect a co-operation? </P> 
<P>A. Early in October General Burgoyne gave it out in orders
that there were po∣werful armies of the King's then co-operating with ours.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">52.</NOTE>Q. Did not those orders give
spirits to General Burgoyne's army? </P> 
<P>A. Situated as our army was, every prospect of reinforcement
must certainly give us spirits.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">53.</NOTE>Q. Did you ever hear of any
co-operation before those orders of General Burgoyne's in October?</P> 
<P>A. It was generally talked of in the army, but not by
authority.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">54.</NOTE>Q. Whether, if the operations of
Sir Henry Clinton on the North River had taken place in time, it would not have
been looked on as a very advantageous co-operation with General Burgoyne's
army?</P> 
<P><PB N="66" REF="73"/>A. It might have been attended with very
good consequences.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">55.</NOTE>Q. What situation in general,
and particularly with regard to provisions, was General Burgoyne's army in,
at the time you mentioned those encouraging hopes of co-operation in his
orders?</P> 
<P>A. The army was put on short allowance at that time.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">56.</NOTE>Q. Whether in military affairs a
powerful diversion, if well executed, is not known often to answer very
effectually the purposes of co-operation?</P> 
<P>A. Certainly very good effects have accrued from powerful
diversions.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">57.</NOTE>Q. If there had been a council of
war on the 20th of September, or immediately after the engagement of the 19th,
should you have known of it?</P> 
<P>A. I think I must have heard of it.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">58.</NOTE>Q. Whether, considering the
circumstances of Sir William Howe's having car∣ried his army to Chesapeak
Bay, you supposed, or ever heard it supposed, that Sir Henry Clinton
would have attempted his operations up the North River sooner than he did, or
previous to the arrival of his reinforcement from Europe?</P> 
<P>A. Not knowing Sir Henry Clinton's strength, or his orders,
nor the force the enemy had to oppose him, it is impossible for me to
answer that ques∣tion.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">59.</NOTE>Q. What effect had it on the
spirits of General Burgoyne's army when they found there was to be no
co-operation between that army and the army of Sir William Howe?</P> 
<P>A. We never knew but that there was to be a co-operation.</P></Q><STAGE>[Withdrew.</STAGE></P>

<P> CAPTAIN BLOOMFIELD, of the Artillery, called in, and examined
by General Burgoyne. 
<Q> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">1.</NOTE>Q. IN what capacity did you
serve in the campaign in America in 1776 and 1777?</P> 
<P>A. I was major of brigade of the royal artillery.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">2.</NOTE>Q. Was you employed by General
Phillips, on your return to England, after the campaign of 1776, to solicit a
further supply of artillery for the service of the ensuing campaign?</P> 
<P>A. On my leaving General Phillips at St. John's, in the month
of November, 1776, I was charged with a letter to Sir Guy Carleton, wherein he
recommended <PB N="67" REF="74"/> it to make a demand of a further supply of
artillery and stores for the com∣plete equipment of an additional number of
gun-boats for the service of Lake Champlain in the ensuing campaign, and
likewise for the boats themselves to be sent out in frame-work. Sir Guy
Carleton, on perusing the letter, disap∣proved of the boats being sent
out, but approved of the demand of the stores and artillery agreeable to
General Phillips's request, and they were accordingly sent out in the
beginning of the year 1777.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">3.</NOTE>Q. At what time did you join the
army in the campaign of 1777? </P> 
<P>A. I joined the army at Ticonderoga on the 23d of July.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">4.</NOTE>Q. Did you live in the family of
General Phillips, and had you occasion to know his sentiments respecting
the artillery department?</P> 
<P>A. I did chiefly live with the general, and had frequent
occasion to know his sentiments on the subject of the artillery in the
course of my duty as brigade∣major.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">5.</NOTE>Q. Did you know, or had you
reason to believe, that the proportion of ar∣tillery employed that campaign
was according to the opinion and recommenda∣tion of General Phillips?</P> 
<P>A. I can have no doubt but that an officer of General
Phillips's rank and extensive experience must have determined that
point.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">6.</NOTE>Q. What was the distribution of
the artillery after the enemy evacuated Ti∣conderoga? </P> 
<P>A. The light brigade of artillery proceeded with the army by
the way of Skenesborough; the park brigade and stores were conveyed
across Lake George in bateaux.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">7.</NOTE>Q. Was not a considerable
portion of artillery of the heaviest kind either left at St. John's, sent
back from Ticonderoga, or disposed of in vessels?</P> 
<P>A. It was: there were left at Ticonderoga six heavy
twelve-pounders, one light twelve-pounder, four light three-pounders, four
royal mortars and twelve co∣horns. Left on board the Royal George, two heavy
twenty-four-pounders, two thirteen-inch mortars, two ten-inch mortars, four
eight-inch mortars, four royal mortars and eight cohorns. Sent back to St.
John's in the Radau, fourteen heavy twenty-four-pounders, two eight-inch
howitzers. Left at Fort George, four medium twelve-pounders, two light
six-pounders, two eight-inch howitzers, two royal howitzers. With Colonel St.
Leger's expedition to Fort Stanwix were sent two light six-pounders, two
light three-pounders, four cohorns. Left at St. John's, four light
six-pounders, five light three-pounders, four cohorn mortars: that was the
distribution of artillery that remained after the army had quitted Fort
George. The quantity of artillery brought forward with the army were four
medium twelve-pounders, two light twenty-four-pounders, eighteen light
six-pounders, six light three-pounders, two eighteen-inch howitzers, four
royal howitzers, two eight-inch mortars, four royal mortars.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">8.</NOTE>Q. Was not that park artillery,
tho' consisting of some twenty-four-pounders and some twelve pounders,
properly field artillery?</P> 
<P>A. They certainly were, and have ever been considered as
such on all field services. Heavy artillery is of a distinct nature, and
considerably heavier than guns of the same calibre which we had in the
army.</P> 
<P><PB N="68" REF="75"/><NOTE PLACE="marg">9.</NOTE>Q. Have you
ever known a less proportion than the brigaded artillery, which was attached
to the line and to the advanced corps, allotted to the same num∣ber of
troops?</P> 
<P>A. The proportion of field artillery certainly should vary
both in quantity and nature according to the variety of circumstances under
which the army is to act; the usual allotment of light field pieces are two
to each battalion; and from a calculation of the number and strength of
General Burgoyne's army, I do not conceive that our light field artillery
exceeded that proportion.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">10.</NOTE>Q. What do you apprehend was the
proposed use of artillery in the country in which we were to act?</P> 
<P>A. To dislodge the enemy from such posts as every where
present themselves in that part of the country, and from which it may be
impossible to dislodge them without artillery of a more considerable
calibre than light six-pounders.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">11.</NOTE>Q. Do you remember the position
which the enemy evacuated at Schuyler's Island?</P> 
<P>A. I do perfectly.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">12.</NOTE>Q. Had that position been
maintained, would not artillery of the heaviest nature we had have been
particularly serviceable?</P> 
<P>A. Provided the post could not have been turned, and the
enemy had made use of every advantage which the ground gave them, I have no
doubt but the park artillery would have been absolutely necessary.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">13.</NOTE>Q. Had the passage of the
Hudson's River, or of Batten Kill been disputed, would artillery of that
nature have been serviceable?</P> 
<P>A. Doubtless it would.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">14.</NOTE>Q. Had the enemy taken a
position at the Forks of the Mohawk River, would artillery of that nature
have been serviceable?</P> 
<P>A. From the imperfect manner in which I saw that ground, it
appeared ca∣pable of being made extremely defensible, and, of course, that
sort of artillery would have been serviceable.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">15.</NOTE>Q. Had the army reached Albany,
and it had been found expedient to for∣tify a camp there for the winter, would
artillery of that nature have been necessary?</P> 
<P>A. There can be no doubt of it.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">16.</NOTE>Q. What do you apprehend to be
the chief use of howitzers and small mortars in the field.</P> 
<P>A. I apprehend they are of infinite service against all
kinds of log work, ab∣baties, and against entrenchments. The small mortars
are particularly useful against redoubts and other works where the enemy
are confined within a small space.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">17.</NOTE>Q. Are not log works a species
of fortification peculiar to that country?</P> 
<P>A. I never saw any elsewhere.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">18.</NOTE>Q. Was the carrying forward the
artillery from Lake George to the place where the army crossed the
Hudson's River any impediment to the transport of pro∣visions?</P> 
<P>A. The transport of our artillery and stores were
constantly made by horses <PB N="69" REF="76"/> attached to our department,
and therefore I do not conceive it did in any man∣ner interfere with the
transport of provisions—I mean to confine myself in this answer
to the transport from Fort George to the Hudson's River; for after
cros∣sing the river we had some oxen and horses attached to the
service of the ar∣tillery, which I believe were before employed in bringing
forward provisions and bateaux.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">19.</NOTE>Q. What time did it take to bring
forward the park artillery from Fort George to the bridge of boats over the
Hudson's River?</P> 
<P>A. The light brigade and the artillery of the park, with their
proper propor∣tion of stores and ammunition, had their horses, carriages,
and drivers constantly attached to them; it therefore required no more time
to carry those stores than was necessary for the carriages themselves
to pass from Fort George to the Hudson's River; but with respect to the
reserve which was afterwards trans∣ported by water in bateaux, I believe
two days with all our carriages would easily have conveyed them to the
Hudson's River.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">20.</NOTE>Q. Do you remember the position
of the King's troops from the time of the attack on the 19th of September to
the attack on the 7th of October?</P> 
<P>A. Yes.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">21.</NOTE>Q. Had the army made a movement
to gain the left of the enemy's en∣trenchments without previously
constructing redoubts on the heights that com∣manded the plain, would not the
bateaux, provisions and hospital have been left open to an attack from the
enemy's right?</P> 
<P>A. They would have been left exposed undoubtedly.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">22.</NOTE>Q. Were not the largest guns we
had the properest pieces of artillery for those redoubts?</P> 
<P>A. I think it was a service that was exactaly adapted to
them.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">23.</NOTE>Q. Do you remember the
disposition made by General Burgoyne on the 7th of October?</P> 
<P>A. I do.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">24.</NOTE>Q. At what time was you wounded
in that attack? </P> 
<P>A. I believe in about twenty minutes after it commenced.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">25.</NOTE>Q. What circumstance of the
action did you observe before you was wound∣ed, particularly respecting the
artillery and the enemy's advancing under the fire of the artillery, and what
happened to the troops posted immediately on the left of the artillery?</P> 
<P>A. The ground on which the artillery was posted was a clear
spot, in a great measure surrounded by woods, the skirts of which on
our left was distant about two hundred yards where the attack first began.
The two medium twelve-pounders were posted on a small eminence, nearly in
the center of this cleared spot between the German picquets and a detachment
of the Hesse Hanau regi∣ment. On the enemy's column approaching, the fire
of the twelve-pounders and the four sixes was immediately directed towards
the enemy's column, notwith∣standing which, they drew up along the skirts
of the wood behind trees, and after driving in the Germans, kept a pretty warm
fire of musketry on the guns and the troops posted about them; soon after
this I heard a firing on the right <PB N="70" REF="77"/> towards a cleared
spot, separated from us by a wood on which the light infan∣try were
posted on very commanding ground. On their retreating, as also the
twenty-fourth regiment who was drawn up in the wood on our right, the enemy
made their appearance on an eminence on our right, and cut off the retreat of
the ar∣tillery—At this moment I received my wound, and therefore can give
no farther account of the circumstances of that day's action.</P></Q></P>
<P> <HI>Examined by other Members of the Committee.</HI> 
<Q> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">26.</NOTE>Q. What was the number of
horses in general employed for the artillery af∣ter the march from
Ticonderoga?</P> 
<P>A. The whole number of horses detached with the British
artillery, previous to the passing the Hudson's River, was about four
hundred.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">27.</NOTE>Q. How many would have been
necessary for the field pieces attached to the battalions only?</P> 
<P>A. Eighteen six-pounders at four horses each; six
three-pounders at three horses each, and two royal howitzers at three
horses each: the remainder were for park artillery, ammunition, and stores
of all kinds to accommodate the army on its march.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">28.</NOTE>Q. Was the forage for these
horses procured in the country on their march, or brought from a
distance?</P> 
<P>A. A quantity of oats was brought forward from Canada, but
with respect to other forage they were under the necessity of collecting
it in the neighbourhood of the encampment.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">29.</NOTE>Q. How many waggons might the
bringing on that quantity of oats employ?</P> 
<P>A. I believe the quantity of oats after passing Fort
Edward was so trifling that I don't believe it loaded one waggon.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">30.</NOTE>Q. After the army arrived at Fort
Edward, did any delay or not arise to its forward progress from bringing on
the park artillery, waiting for horses and dri∣vers for that purpose, or to
provide forage?</P> 
<P>A. The park artillery remained at Fort Edward no longer than
was necessary during the time the army remained in that neighbourhood: I do
not know of any delay whatever from the want of horses and drivers. Had the
park artillery moved forwards sooner, no end could have been answered by
it, before the bridge was thrown over the Hudson's River.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">31.</NOTE>Q. Were there any gun-boats
sent out to Quebec for the campaign 1776?</P> 
<P>A. There were.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">32.</NOTE>Q. Were there a sufficient
number sent out, in your opinion?</P> 
<P>A. It appeared that the naval force was superior to that of
the rebels, from the event of that engagement; and therefore I conclude, that
for the uses of that cam∣paign there were a sufficient number.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">33.</NOTE>Q. Did you apprehend, before the
event of the action on the lakes, that the num∣ber was sufficient, and went
out in time?</P> 
<P><PB N="71" REF="78"/>A. We had received very exaggerated
accounts of the rebel force on the lakes, and therefore uncommon exertions were
used to render our force as formidable as possible; and probably some
time was lost, and the campaign in some degree retarded, from that
circumstance.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">34.</NOTE>Q. Would the campaign have been
retarded so long if a greater number of gun∣boats had been sent out?</P> 
<P>A. Certainly not.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">35.</NOTE>Q. What number of artificers were
sent to Canada for the campaign in 1776? </P> 
<P>A. I don't immediately recollect the exact number; but I think
Colonel Christie engaged about two hundred. I know of no others being sent

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">37.</NOTE>Q. Whether the number of

the purpose of carrying it on?</P>

of St. John's only, most of the bateaux being built by private contract.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">38.</NOTE>Q. Were not the operations of

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">39.</NOTE>Q. Were there not horses
necessary for conveying the stores and ammunition necessary for the

<P>A. The best answer to that question will, I apprehend,
be a state of the number of horses actually attached to the several
brigades of artillery, since the allotment of stores and ammunition were
exactly proportioned to the number of pieces which they

<P> It is observed that the injunction given, before

baggage than they can possibly be supplied with means of conveying, when
they quit the lake and rivers; warning is therefore again given to the
officers, to convey by the bateaux, which will soon return to Ticonderoga,
the baggage that is not indispensibly necessary to them; or upon the
first sudden movement, it must inevitably be left upon the ground. Such
gentlemen as served in America the last war may remember that the officers
took up with soldiers' tents, and often confined their baggage to a

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">17.</NOTE>Q. Was the army ever so high in
numbers, Provincials and Indians excepted, as at that period?</P> 
<P>A. I believe it never was. On the 3d of September additional
companies joined the British, to the amount of about 300 men; but from killed
and wounded, and the garrison left at Ticonderoga, the army was at no time
equal to its first number.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">18.</NOTE>Q. What was the force left at

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">19.</NOTE>Q. Do you remember the difficulties
which attended moving the wounded to Ticonderoga, after the action at
Huberton?</P> 
<P>A. I remember to have heard they were very great. Different
propositions were made for the removing them, such as biers and
hand-barrows, which were so very incommodious, that I remember to have been
told that the wounded would rather be left where they were than move in the

troops to the country in the neighbourhood of Cas∣tleton?</P> 
<P>A. I don't remember to have been present when General
Reidesel received his orders or instructions; but I understood it was to
create an alarm towards the Con∣necticut, to give encouragement to the loyal
inhabitants, if any such there were, and to protect those that were wounded
at Huberton or thereabouts.</P> 
<P><PB N="75" REF="82"/><NOTE PLACE="marg">21.</NOTE>Q. Was the
removal of those wounded effected long before General Reidesel was recalled
from Castleton?</P> 
<P>A. I believe not; for I am not quite certain that the whole were
moved when Ge∣neral Reidesel returned to the army at Skenesborough, a day
or two before the first division of the army moved towards Fort Anne.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">22.</NOTE>Q. Have you any papers written by

was forwarder in its progress towards Albany, in point of time, than it would
have been had it taken the route by Ticonderoga and Lake George?</P> 
<P>A. In answer to that question I have to say, the army, by
taking that route, was a-head of the transport of provisions, which, for

<P>A. He desired me to leave it with him till the afternoon for
his consideration. He came himself to my tent the next morning early; he
expressed himself to me in a manner that conveyed a disapprobation of
the Germans being employed in it. I think I observed to him that since the
honour gained by the advanced corps at Hu∣berton, I believed General Reidesel
was desirous of having the Germans employed. I mentioned to General Fraser
my ideas of provisions being obtained by that expedi∣tion, and the army
thereby enabled to get quicker on to Albany than waiting for the slow
transport from Fort George. General Fraser said something about
Germans, which I don't recollect; which brought this remark from me. I
desired General Fraser, from the friendship he had for General Burgoyne,
if he saw any real objection to this plan, to express himself fully and
freely to General Burgoyne himself; that the scouts of the army and the
guides were attached to his the advanced corps, and he might, through them,
perhaps know more of the nature of the country than I did; and therefore I
pressed him to mention his objections, if he had any, to General Burgoyne.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">65.</NOTE>Q. Do you remember the officer
mentioning that they had not above fifty or sixty men in the regiment?</P> 
<P>A. I can't speak positively to that; but in my own judgment
they did not ex∣ceed that number.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">66.</NOTE>Q. Were not both the field-officers
wounded? </P> 
<P>A. Colonel Anstruther and Major Harnage were both wounded, and
a great many other officers were killed and wounded, and the regiment
suffered greatly.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">67.</NOTE>Q. To what degree did the men of
the artillery suffer in that action? </P> 
<P>A. I think, but am not quite certain, that the number that were
with four guns amounted to forty-eight. I saw Captain Jones, who was a very
gallant man, and commanded those four guns, killed, and some other officers
wounded, and I be∣lieve about thirty six of the men were killed and wounded.
I should in justice to the artillery say, that I think it is not in the
power of men to keep a bet∣ter fire, both of round and grape-shot, than was
successively maintained for several hours that day.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">68.</NOTE>Q. From your experience in the
service, do you conceive it would have oc∣curred to any officer, to engage
troops, if he could possibly avoid it, in the situa∣tion in which the
British line was the day after that action?</P> 
<P>A. The experience of an officer of my inferior rank does not
lead to much; but I should have been sorry to have given orders to those
regiments, after the gallant sufferings of that day, to have attacked an army
reported, both from our spies and our prisoners, to be very near if not
more than four times the num∣ber of our whole force: add to this, the country
was a very thick wood, and <PB N="80" REF="87"/> the situation of the rebel
camp, I believe, could not by any means be recon∣noitred within that space of
time.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">69.</NOTE> Q</P> 
<P>Do you remember General Burgoyne receiving a letter from Sir
Henry Clinton the day but one after that action, informing him, that he
intended about that time an attack on Fort Montgomery?</P> 
<P>A. I do remember his receiving a letter from Sir Henry Clinton
about that time; it was the 22d of September.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">70.</NOTE>Q. Do you imagine that any officer
knowing of that letter would have enter∣tained thoughts of immediately renewing
an attack upon the enemy?</P> 
<P>A. As far as an opinion of an officer of my inferior rank goes,
I should not have thought of it, nor did I hear any officer of any rank
express such an idea at that time.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">71.</NOTE>Q. From what you knew of the
country, did you not believe that a suc∣cessful attack from Sir Henry
Clinton during the time we lay at that camp, would either have dislodged
General Gates entirely, or have obliged him to de∣tach considerably from his
army?</P> 
<P>A. I remember our scouts giving information, that a bridge was
laid over the Hudson's River, very near the enemy's camp; and it was the
opinion of some very confidential men that were employed in that army in that
capacity, and were much under the direction of General Fraser, that on the
approach of Sir Henry Clinton's army, the army of Mr. Gates could not stand
us, but would cross the river, and go towards New England. Whether the idea
was right or wrong, I can't tell.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">72.</NOTE>Q. Did you ever hear such
persons, or any others, express an idea, that the enemy would have taken
the same measure on our advancing to attack them without that
co-operation?</P> 
<P>A. I don't remember to have heard any such thing.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">73.</NOTE>Q. Do you imagine that any officer
knowing of Sir Henry Clinton's letters, would have thought it proper to retreat
after the action of the 19th of Sep∣tember?</P> 
<P>A. I never heard any officer express an idea of that sort. I
don't know what officers might be within the knowledge of such a letter; but
I lived intimate∣ly with General Phillips, General Fraser, and with Mr.
Twiss, the engineer; whether the letter was in their knowledge or not, I
don't know: but I never heard them express such an idea.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">74.</NOTE>Q. Did you ever hear any officer of
that army, though unacquainted with the letter, before or since the time,
express a disapprobation of the measure of remaining in that camp without
either attacking or retreating?</P> 
<P>A. Neither then or at any time while I remained in America, and
of course not since.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">75.</NOTE>Q. From your conversation with
the chief engineer, and from other circum∣stances, have you reason to know,
that every possible means were used after the action of the 19th, to
obtain a knowledge of the ground on the enemy's left?</P> 
<P><PB N="81" REF="88"/>A. I had frequent conversations with the
chief engineer on that subject. I be∣lieve his attention was given to that
point almost every day, and a knowledge of that ground I understood to be
very difficult to be obtained.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">76.</NOTE>Q. Was not the right of the enemy
deemed impracticable. </P> 
<P>A. I had no opportunity myself of seeing the right of the
enemy; but I un∣derstood from others, that the position was too strong to
be attacked with any pro∣spect of success.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">77.</NOTE>Q. Were there not frequent
consultations held between General Burgoyne, Ge∣neral Phillips and General
Fraser, previous to the movement up to the enemy on the 7th of October?</P> 
<P>A. I understood there was scarce a day passed without
such consultation; I be∣lieve no day after the action of the 19th.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">78.</NOTE>Q. Did you conceive that the chief
purpose of that movement was to attain a knowledge of the left of the enemy's
position, and if expedient to attack them there?</P> 
<P>A. I understood it was.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">79.</NOTE>Q. Did it appear to you, that the
force left in camp, under General Hamil∣ton, was more than sufficient to keep
the enemy in check?</P> 
<P>A. I don't think it was.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">80.</NOTE>Q. From the intimacy and confidence
in which you lived with General Bur∣goyne and General Fraser, do you imagine
any disagreement of opinion could have subsisted between them without
your knowledge?</P> 
<P>A. I think I must have heard of it.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">81.</NOTE>Q. Do you know any instance, but
more especially respecting the periods of passing the Hudson's River,
the action of the 19th of September, and that of the 7th of October, wherein
General Fraser expressed a disapprobation of Gene∣ral Burgoyne's
measures?</P> 
<P>A. I do not: but I would beg leave to observe, that upon the
plan to Bennington, General Fraser had expressed a different opinion,
with respect to em∣ploying the Germans. At the time of passing the
Hudson's River, and after it was crossed, I had a great deal of
conversation with General Fraser: he seemed to express satisfaction
in the manner in which the troops had passed.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">82.</NOTE>Q. In the action of the 7th of
October, after the German troops on the left of the artillery had given way,
did you observe General Phillips and General Reidesel in person?</P> 
<P>A. I was with General Phillips at different times, and I saw
General Reide∣sel more than once; they were both very active, and exerted
themselves very much to form the broken troops, and to make the retreat as
regular as the cir∣cumstances would permit.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">83.</NOTE>Q. What was the last time you
saw Sir Francis Clarke in that action, and do you know what orders he was
carrying?</P> 
<P>A. It was after the retreat was become very general. Sir Francis
Clarke asked me, if I had given any orders to the artillery to retreat? I
told him, that as there was a major-general of the artillery in the field, who
was confessed by the army to be a very excellent officer, I would not take
on myself, as ad∣jutant-general, <PB N="82" REF="89"/> to give orders to any
part of the artillery. Sir Francis Clarke told me, that a disposition had
been made for a general retreat, and that he was going with orders from General
Burgoyne to bring off the artillery. About the instant we were parting, a
very heavy fire came upon us from the enemy, and I have since had reason to
believe, that Sir Francis Clarke received his wound at that time.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">84.</NOTE>Q. On the day of the 8th, do you
remember the enemy forming a line in the meadows, and making a demonstration
of attacking us?</P> 
<P>A. I do remember it very well, and that there was a great deal
of cannonading from the enemy.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">85.</NOTE>Q. Do you remember also a
cannonading in the afternoon, about the time of General Fraser's funeral?</P>

<P>A. I think I shall never forget that circumstance. General
Fraser, I under∣stood had desired to be buried privately, in one of the
redoubts that had been raised for the protection of our magazines and
stores; as the corpse was passing by, General Burgoyne, General
Phillips, and I believe General Reidesel, and several other officers, out
of respect to General Fraser's memory, and to do him honour in the eyes of
the army, notwithstanding his request, attended his fune∣ral into the
redoubt. The enemy were in this instance, I thought, very defec∣tive in point
of humanity; they pointed a gun or two at that very redoubt, and kept up a
brisk cannonade during the whole of the funeral service, which was
performed with great solemnity and very deliberately by Mr. Brudenel, the
chaplain. I never saw so affecting a sight.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">86.</NOTE>Q. Do you remember on the march to
Saratoga seeing a corps of the enemy at work on the plain of Saratoga?</P> 
<P>A. I do very well; a working party, and what appeared to be a
battalion or more drawn up as a covering party.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">87.</NOTE>Q. Was that the corps that
afterwards took post on the opposite side of the river?</P> 
<P>A. I believe it was the same corps I saw afterwards
passing the ford.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">88.</NOTE>Q. After the arrival of the army at
Saratoga, was Lieutenant Colonel Suther∣land detached with a command to cover a
party of workmen to repair bridges and roads, in order to continue the retreat
on the west side of the river?</P> 
<P>A. He was ordered with a party to repair bridges and roads on
the west side.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">89.</NOTE>Q. Do you remember on what account
Colonel Sutherland and the party were recalled?</P> 
<P>A. I believe it was on information given by our scouts, that
the enemy were preparing to attack us in great force.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">90.</NOTE>Q. Have you further reason to
know that a geneaal attack on that day was really intended by the enemy?</P> 
<P>A. There was particular caution sent round to all the troops
to be prepared for that attack, as it was expected it would be attempted under
cover of a very thick fog then prevailing. After the convention had taken
place, a gene∣ral officer in the rebel service acquainted me, that such an
attack was intended, <PB N="83" REF="90"/> and from information, I believe from
deserters, or from their own scouts, that our army was exceedingly well
prepared to receive them, that they would be very much exposed when they came
on the plain to our artillery, he not only re∣treated with his command, but
sent word to another general officer to retreat also. The other general
officer was his senior; but he had taken that upon him, from the fear of the
consequences of such an attack, of which he sent word to General Gates,
who approved and confirmed his order.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">91.</NOTE>Q. Previous to the council of war
to which the field officers were called, do you remember it being determined in
the council of the generals, to try a night march, abandoning the carriages and
baggage, and orders being given for the delivery of as much provisions as the
men could carry?</P> 
<P>A. I do remember such a determination very well.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">92.</NOTE>Q. What prevented the execution of
it? </P> 
<P>A. I understood there were such difficulties in getting out
the provisions, that the delivery of the necessary provisions could not
be accomplished.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">93.</NOTE>Q. Had we intelligence the next day
from different scouts, that the enemy was in possession of the
country in force, on both sides the Hudson's River, between us and Fort
Edward?</P> 
<P>A. I understood, from some of the scouts that we had been
accustomed most to depend on, that the enemy were so posted.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">94.</NOTE>Q. Have you reason to know that
the intelligence General Burgoyne stated to the council of war on this
subject was true?</P> 
<P>A. I was assured by one of the general officers who
conducted us towards Boston that troops of theirs were in the position that
our scouts had given us information of.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">95.</NOTE>Q. Did you learn at the same time
at what period those posts were taken up by the enemy, whether before or
after our arrival at Saratoga?</P> 
<P>A. I have extracts of minutes made at that time, from the mouth
of the ge∣neral officer I mentioned.</P> 
<P> <STAGE>[Reads.]</STAGE>— 
<Q> 
<TEXT LANG="eng">
<BODY>
<DIV1 TYPE="minutes">
<P>When the king's army was returning to Saratoga, a

Hudson's River, to dispute the ford, and two thousand men more were
posted between us and Fort Edward, on the same side of the river.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">96.</NOTE>Q. Have you an extract of the

remember to have heard General Phillips make an offer, which I thought a very
spirited one, to risk his life in attempting, with one or two of our best
guides, to find a passage to Ticonderoga, and do his utmost for the
defence of that garrison, as an artillery officer, should the enemy attack
that fortress after the convention should take place.</P>

<P>I believe that the men on command were explained to me by General Gates
to have been detached from his army, in the rear and upon the flanks of the
king's troops, previous to the convention.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">99.</NOTE>Q. Do you apprehend that that return
includes the corps that were on the other side of the Hudson's River,
immediately opposite to Saratoga?</P> 
<P>A. I do recollect the name of one of the general officers who was on the
other side of the Hudson's River, included in Mr. Gates's return, and
therefore I imagine the men under his command are included also. When I say
one, I do not mean to have understood that the other two general officers,
the one who was stationed with a party opposite to Saratoga, and the one
who was stationed on the same side of the water, between us and Fort
Edward, are not also included in General Gates's return.</P> 
<P><PB N="85" REF="92"/><NOTE PLACE="marg">100.</NOTE>Q. Do the returns to
which you referred of our army state the effective strength, at the time of
signing the convention?</P> 
<P>A. They do state the rough number, collected at that time, of men
present and under arms.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">101.</NOTE>State the numbers.

<P>There might be people recovered from their wounds who were discharged
from the hospital, and had joined the corps; or there might have been a
mistake in the return, just before the convention, in the confusion of
the army at that time.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">103.</NOTE>Q. Do you remember what passed
respecting the military chest, while the treaty of Saratoga was
depending?</P> 
<P>A. I do remember that it was strongly recommended to the commanding
officers of corps to take sums of money from the paymaster general, on
account of subsistence then due to their regiments; and I believe a great
deal of money was so distributed, and regularly accounted for to the
paymaster general on the subsequent settlement of the pay of the
army.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">104.</NOTE>Q. What became of the rest of the money
in the military chest? </P> 
<P>A. It was taken by the paymaster general to Albany.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">105.</NOTE>Q. Did any part of it fall into the hands
of the enemy? </P> 
<P>A. Not a shilling that I ever heard of.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">106.</NOTE>Q. Was any proportion of it lost,
embezzled, or secreted? </P> 
<P>A. If any such thing had happened, I think the paymaster general
would have applied to me immediately. Never having heard, then or at any time
after, of any loss having been sustained, I do not believe there was any
loss suffered in the retreat or after it.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">107.</NOTE>Q. Was the secret service account,
during the campaign, kept by you? </P> 
<P>A. It was.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">108.</NOTE>Q. Could you produce the several
articles of that account, if called on for it?</P> 
<P>A. I have either a copy of it at home of my own, or from the paymaster
general.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">109.</NOTE>Q. Did General Burgoyne ever appropriate
any part of that expenditure to the extraordinaries of his own expences, or to
any other purpose for his own use?</P> 
<P>A. Never that I know of.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">110.</NOTE>Q. Must not you have known it if it had
been so? </P> 
<P>A. Certainly.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">111.</NOTE>Q. Were there not occasions where
General Burgoyne paid, from his own purse, expences that, in the opinion of
others, he might have been justified in placing to the public account?</P> 
<P><PB N="86" REF="93"/>A. I remember to have been told by other gentlemen,
that expences of that sort General Burgoyne had been at, ought to have been
charged in that manner.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">112.</NOTE>Q. What was the nature of those
expences?</P> 
<P>A. They were presents to people who had distinguished
themselves, and in acts of charity to women who had lost their husbands,
and other occasions which it was very proper for a general officer to give,
and very proper to put into a public account.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">113.</NOTE>Q. Had not General Burgoyne, from his
situation, all the expences attending a Commander in Chief?</P> 
<P>A. He certainly had, from being obliged to keep a public table for the
entertain∣ment and refreshment of officers and others coming to head
quarters, on duty or business; and I know those expences to have been
very great, from the exceeding high price of all the articles of life in that
part of the world.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">114.</NOTE>Q. Did General Burgoyne ever receive more
than the appointment of a lieutenant general?</P> 
<P>A. Never.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">115.</NOTE>Q. Was there not a board of general
officers appointed at Cambridge, to inspect all the accounts of the campaign;
and did not General Burgoyne regulate the pay∣ment of the battalions by the
report of that board?</P> 
<P>A. There was such a board, and the payments were regulated according
to the report of that board.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">116.</NOTE>Q. Upon the whole of what you know of
General Burgoyne's receipts and expences, do you believe he was, in his own
purse, a gainer or a sufferer in the campaign 1777?</P> 
<P>A. I really believe his appointments were not equal to his expences in
that campaign.</P></Q></P>
<P> <HI>Examined by other Members of the Committee and by General Burgoyne
occasionally.</HI> 
<Q> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">117.</NOTE>Q. What were the numbers of the effective
British, at the opening of the cam∣paign 1777, including officers and
non-commissioned officers?</P> 
<P>A. I have not those returns; but they were sent to the Commander in
Chief, and my extracts are for the rank and file.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">118.</NOTE>Q. Can you answer that question with
respect to the Germans?</P> 
<P>A. My extracts are the same both for the British and the
Germans.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">119.</NOTE>Q. What was the greatest number of
Provincials in the army at any time in the campaign?</P> 
<P>A. I believe the only question that has been asked respecting them
was at the be∣ginning of the campaign; they were then eighty-three. On the
first of September they amounted to about six hundred and eighty, which was
the greatest number they ever amounted to.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">120.</NOTE>Q. What do you mean by Provincials?</P> 
<P><PB N="87" REF="94"/>A. I understand them to be inhabitants of that
country, assembled under officers who were to have had different
commissions, provided they had ever amounted to certain numbers.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">121.</NOTE>Q. Do you include Canadians under the name
of Provincials? </P> 
<P>A. I believe, in the former part of my evidence, the Canadians were
stated to be one hundred and forty-eight, and distinguished from the
Provincials.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">122.</NOTE>Q. Was General Burgoyne's second order
of the twelfth of July, relating to the baggage, strictly complied with?</P> 
<P>A. I conceive it was the duty of the commanding officers of regiments to
enforce an observance and obedience to the general orders.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">123.</NOTE>Q. Was it actually enforced in such a
manner to the degree you thought it should have been?</P> 
<P>A. I am not quite positive whether there was not another order
issued after∣wards.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">124.</NOTE><STAGE>[Question repeated.]</STAGE></P> 
<P>A. I never had any report made to me by a commanding officer of any
corps, of that order not being complied with.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">125.</NOTE>Q. What was your own ocular observation
of the quantity of baggage carried with the army; and did it appear to you that
that order could have been fairly com∣plied with?</P> 
<P>A. I own I don't recollect, not hearing any complaint nor attending to
it. The quarter master general of the army must naturally know more of the
baggage than the adjutant general.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">126.</NOTE>Q. Do you know what allowance of waggons
was made to a regiment? </P> 
<P>A. I don't recollect any waggons that we had to allow.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">127.</NOTE>Q. Was none of the baggage brought down in
wheeled carriages? </P> 
<P>A. Several officers, I believe, bought waggons and carts of the country
people for their own use; but I do not remember any of the king's carts or
waggons being appropriated to the carriage of officers' baggage. It might be,
but I don't recollect it.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">128.</NOTE>Q. Can you say, in a general way, how
many horses might be employed in car∣rying the baggage of the army, including
officers' horses?</P> 
<P>A. I never had any information upon that subject; it did not belong to
my de∣partment, and I had much business on my hands.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">129.</NOTE>Q. How was the regimental baggage
carried?</P> 
<P>A. I believe chiefly in bateaux.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">130.</NOTE>Q. How was it carried when there was no
water-carriage? </P> 
<P>A. I can't speak to that point, having had no information on that
subject; and when I speak of bateaux, I speak generally, having
<HI>had</HI> no information on the subject.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">131.</NOTE>Q. Can you say, in a general way, how
many women attended the army?</P> 
<P>A. I had really so much to do that I had not much leisure to pay
much attention to the ladies; and I know very little of their beauty or their
numbers.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">132.</NOTE>Q. Would not the feeding of two thousand
women be a considerable object with respect to the provisions of the
army?</P> 
<P><PB N="88" REF="95"/>A. I should have been very sorry to have had two
thousand women to have experienced that.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">133.</NOTE>Q. How many women were there, if not two
thousand?</P> 
<P>A. I would wish to give the house every information in my power, whe
n ca n speak with any degree of accuracy or tolerable guess. I have seen
the commis∣sary of provisions return, and I think the number of women
returned, as victualled from the stores, were very very few.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">134.</NOTE>Q. Do you think that a corps of dragoons
mounted would have been of great use to the army?</P> 
<P>A. I own, I very much wished those few dragoons we had could have
been mounted, because, though in that part of America that I saw they might
not have been necessary or useful to have made a charge, I think those
light dragoons might be always applied to very useful services.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">135.</NOTE>Q. How many had you of those
dragoons?</P> 
<P>A. They are included in the strength of the Germans, and I really do
not re∣member their particular number.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">136.</NOTE>Q. If none or less of the park of
artillery had been brought forward, would there not have been horses to have
mounted those dragoons?</P> 
<P>A. I believe there might have been horses enough taken from the
artillery, or from the provision train, to have mounted those dragoons, if
it had been thought more expedient to have employed the horses in that
manner; but they were hired or contracted for, for the special purposes of
carrying provisions, and bringing on the artillery, and never meant by the
persons who furnished the contract for the dra∣goon service.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">137.</NOTE>Q. If a smaller quantity of baggage had
been carried, might not the officers have spared some of their baggage
horses for mounting the dragoons?</P> 
<P>A. I never met with an officer who had horses to spare. I know Sir
Francis Clarke and myself wished to buy horses to carry our own
servants; cared very little what expence we were at, and yet I could not
obtain any.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">138.</NOTE>Q. Do you know of any corps or party
finding their way back to Ca∣nada?</P> 
<P>A. I never heard of any corps finding its way there; and I understood
from the guides who were with us, previous to the convention's taking place,
that if that was attempted, we must break into small parties, and go by
what is called Indian paths.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">139.</NOTE>Q. Supposing there was a small party
that found its way to Canada by In∣dian paths, do you think it would have been
possible for an army to have done the same?</P> 
<P>A. My idea of that must be founded upon the report of those guides
who had served us very faithfully as scouts upon former occasions, and
who inform∣ed me that we must break into very small parties, to have any
chance of mak∣ing our way through the woods to Canada; and I remember that when
General Phillips offered to attempt to find his way to Ticonderoga, it was
talked of and looked on to be as desperate as gallant.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">140.</NOTE>Q. If any party did make its way to
Canada, do you not suppose it must <PB N="89" REF="96"/> be that party of
provincials that ran away while they were employed to repair roads, and that
were never heard of afterwards?</P> 
<P>A. I remember some were reported to have run away who were making
roads, and it is likely to have been that party.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">141.</NOTE>Q. When you mentioned the highest number
of provincials, did you mean that they were all armed?</P> 
<P>A. I know that they were not all armed. We had not arms for them.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">142.</NOTE>Q. Of those that were armed, some
respectable persons excepted, were they much to be depended upon?</P> 
<P>A. A very great part of them were such as I should have placed very
little de∣pendence upon.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">143.</NOTE>Q. Before the army left Canada, was there
not a strict order, that not more than three women a company should be
suffered to embark?</P> 
<P>A. I do know there was such an order issued, and I never heard any
com∣plaint of its having been broke through. I don't recollect the date of that
or∣der, or I would have turned to my book, and stated to the house, upon
the first question relative to the number of women that were employed on
our ex∣pedition.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">144.</NOTE>Q. Is it not the custom in all armies
victualled from the king's stores, to pro∣hibit the delivery of provisions
to any women over and above the number allowed by order?</P> 
<P>A. It was customary in all places where I served in the last war,
and very strong and peremptory orders were given on that subject to the
commissaries in our army.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">145.</NOTE>Q. Do you not then believe, that all women
who followed your army were fed from the ration of the men they followed, or
found their provision in the country?</P> 
<P>A. I remember, upon asking the commissaries how there came to be
so few women in the provincial returns, I was told, it was the custom for
them to be supplied out of the men's rations.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">146.</NOTE>Q. Were the women conveyed on baggage
carts or horses, or did they walk a-foot?</P> 
<P>A. I never heard of the women's being conveyed on baggage carts or the
king's horses.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">147.</NOTE>Q. If the women neither employed the
king's horses, nor consumed his pro∣visions, do you think they were more
of impediment, or of comfort to the king's troops?</P> 
<P>A. I never understood from my conversation with the commanding
officers, or others, that the women were any impediment.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">148.</NOTE>Q. If after the taking of Ticonderoga
there was any doubt in the army in which you served, of their being able to
reach Albany?</P> 
<P>A. I don't remember to have heard any doubts expressed upon that
subject, mean∣ing soon after the taking Ticonderoga.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">149.</NOTE>Q. Was it generally understood in the
army, that it was was well supplied with all the necessaries,
appointments for war, and articles proper for forwarding the expedition to
Albany?</P> 
<P><PB N="90" REF="97"/>A. I always understood that the army had been very
well supplied with every thing.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">150.</NOTE>Q. Do you believe, if the secretary of
state had ordered the army under Ge∣neral Howe to co-operate with the army
under General Burgoyne for the North River, with a view to have formed the
junction of the two armies, that the disaster which befel General
Burgoyne's army could have happened?</P> 
<P>A. If a junction could have been formed, I should apprehend that Mr.
Gates's army might have been dislodged, and that the misfortune at Saratoga
would not have happened. This is only matter of opinion.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">151.</NOTE>Q. Do you apprehend, that if the army
under Sir William Howe had ope∣rated on the North River, with a view to effect
a junction, that such a junc∣tion would have taken place?</P> 
<P>A. I had an opinion while in America, that if the expedition which came
up the Hudson's River under General Vaughan, could have have been there about
the time of our action of the 19th of September, that Mr. Gates would have
found it difficult to have kept his army together, if he had not crossed
over the Hudson's River towards New England. But this is mere matter of
private opinion.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">152.</NOTE>Q. If you are of opinion, that the troops
under General Vaughan would have had so powerful an effect, even so late as
September, what effect do you think Sir William Howe's army, assisted by
all the fleet and craft, would have had as early as the beginning of July,
immediately after the impression which took place among the enemy after the
defeat at Ticonderoga?</P> 
<P>A. I did not know what force there was under the command of General
Vaughan, nor do I even now know; but I should think most certainly, that a
great army upon the Hudson's River near Albany, would have contributed very
much to our making our way to Albany.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">153.</NOTE>Q. Have you ever considered what were
the causes of the failure of the ex∣pedition under General Burgoyne, and to
what do you impute it?</P> 
<P>A. I looked upon our force not to be equal to the forcing our way to
Al∣bany without some co-operation.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">154.</NOTE>Q. Where then did you expect that
co-operation?</P> 
<P>A. I had no where to expect it from, but up the Hudson's River from
New York; and the success of Colonel St. Leger's expedition would have been
of use certainly.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">155.</NOTE>Q. If General Washington's army had not
been diverted, would it not have impeded, or stopped the progress of any
army up the Hudson's River.</P> 
<P>A. I don't know the strength of General Washington's army, nor the
nature of the country between Albany and New York; and therefore I cannot form
any judgment of what would have happened.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">156.</NOTE>Q. Are you not of opinion that there are
very strong passes or posts on that river?</P> 
<P>A. I found them very strong between Ticonderoga and Albany, and from
re∣ports of military men of high reputation in the service, I have
understood there were many very strong posts between New York and
Albany.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">157.</NOTE>Q. From whence is the account of the
strength of Mr. Gates's army taken?</P> 
<P><PB N="91" REF="98"/>A. From a return voluntarily given by General Gates
to me for my own satis∣faction when at Albany, and that return was signed
by General Gartes.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">158.</NOTE>Q. Have you that return? </P> 
<P>A. I gave it to General Burgoyne; I saw it to-day; he has it.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">159.</NOTE>Q. Was it by consent of General Gates
that the soldiers after the convention re∣tained their cartouch-boxes?</P> 
<P>A. They retained their belts, and I really don't recollect whether their
car∣touch boxes were in general retained or not: but talking with Mr. Gates
when the king's troops marched by with the accoutrements on, Mr Gates asked
me (we had been old acquaintance formerly) whether it was not customary on
field days for arms and accoutrements to go together? I told him, there was
nothing said in the convention that I had agreed to with him relating to the
accou∣trements, and that he could have no right to any thing but what was
stipulated in that treaty. He replied, 
<Q REND="inline">"You are perfectly right;"</Q> and turned to some of
the officers in their service by, and said, 
<Q REND="inline">"If we meant to have had them, we ought to have
inserted them in the convention."</Q></P></Q><STAGE>[Withdrew.</STAGE></P>

<PB REF="99"/>
<HEAD>Review of the Evidence; its several Parts compared with the
prefatory Speech and Narrative; and additional Remarks and Explanations.</HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The conduct of Lord G. Germain, during the
enquiry.</NOTE>THE noble Lord who is at issue with me upon this occasion
has, in a great mea∣sure, deprived me of the benefit of a reply, properly
so called, because he has produced no defence. His Lordship certainly has
been accused by me in many instances of a very serious nature. If he is
really willing that his political, and my military conduct should be tried by
facts alone, I certainly have not shewn less incli∣nation than his
Lordship for that test; but, taxed as I avow he has been by me, with
proceedings derogatory to the obligations which ought to subsist between
man and man, I really expected, as I believe did the House of Commons and the
public, to have heard from him some justification in those respects.
Instead of that, the noble Lord, in opening the subjects to which he
proposed to call evidence, touched so slightly upon the branch of the
enquiry in which we are parties, that a stranger would hardly have thought
there subsisted a dispute between us. His Lordship contradicted
nothing that I have alledged respecting his conduct or my own; he stated no
circum∣stance of blame against me, except he meant as such the enterprize
of Bennington, which he qualified with the epithet "fatal," and pronounced to
be the cause of all the subsequent misfortunes. He passed entirely
over the transactions at Saratoga. Of forty officers or more, belonging to
the Convention troops, then in England, one only was proposed to be called on
his Lordship's part, <HI>viz.</HI> Lieutenant Colonel Sutherland, of the 47th
regiment, upon parole from the Congress, and acting with a corps of the
Fencible Men in North Britain; but, upon further reflection, his Lord∣ship
thought proper to dispense with the attendance of this officer; and the
only witness under order of the House was Mr. Skene. No man was better
qualified to give an account of the proceedings at Bennington; and I heartily
lament that the public is deprived of his testimony.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Claim of G. Burgoyne to close the
cause.</NOTE>But although I am thus left in possession of the
evidence, uncontroverted by the noble Lord, I avail myself of my right of
closing the cause, for the fol∣following purposes: 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mode of pro∣ceeding.</NOTE>first, to collect from
the minutes (which, in an enquiry of this nature, are unavoidably prolix and
disarranged) the scattered parts, and apply them to facts, under distinct
and separate heads. Next, to examine whether the facts (which, from the
silence of the noble Lord, I am to assume as admitted by him) are in any
respect invalidated by the cross examination of the witnesses by other
gentlemen. And <PB N="94" REF="100"/> lastly, to explain such
circumstances, and answer such new and collateral objections, as have
been pointed at in the same cross examination, and were omitted, or only
slightly noticed in my opening, because they did not exist, or were not
deemed possible objects of blame or cavil. In pursuing these
purposes, I shall consider the proofs precisely in the order of the
facts to which they are produced.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Insinuation of having acted unfair∣ly by Sir Guy
Carleton, overthrown by his own evidence.</NOTE>Though the first
circumstance I took notice of in my opening, <HI>viz.</HI> my conduct
respecting Sir Guy Carleton, was rather an insinuation than an allegation
against me, I thought it right that it should be the first overthrown by
evidence; for while it remained in any degree of force, it gave a general
tinge, as it was meant to do, to my whole cause. I could not but expect even
the virtuous prejudices of the human heart to be against me, whilst it was
possible to be conceived that in absence of the commander in chief, to
whom I had acted second; whose attention I had constantly experienced;
and with whose confidence I was then honoured; I had practised un∣manly and
adulatory intrigue to supersede him in a favourite object of
command.—There are few worse modes of betraying a superior officer to
be found upon the records of dishonour; and whoever reflects upon the degree
of odium with which the most palliated acts of that species have been
received by mankind, will not wonder at or condemn my impatience, in applying
my first questions to Sir Guy Carleton to that particular object. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">See Sir Guy Carleton's evidence, qu. 1, 2,
3.</NOTE>Clear as my justification stood by the letter formerly referred
to, (No. II.) I shall be forgiven for obtaining, though with some
redundancy, a full and satisfactory confirmation of my innocence, from the
verbal testimony of the party whom I was supposed to have injured.</P>
<P>It may be proper here to observe, that the abovementioned
aspersion, to which I have so often adverted, and at which I have
strove in vain for due terms to express my indignation, was not the only
one cast upon me respecting Sir Guy Carleton. When impartial and candid men
revolted at the insinuation of my treachery, 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aspersion from the pa∣per, No. III.</NOTE>my
presumption and insolence (a lesser but still a calumnious charge)
was pointed out in that part of the paper (No. III.) that treats of the force
to be left in Canada, and the disposition of it. I am pleased with the
questions in the cross examination of Sir Guy Carleton, marking the
prescribed distribution of the troops, &amp;c. (38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43.)
because that enquiry affords me an opportunity of justifying myself in a
point which I have not taken notice of before. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">refuted.</NOTE>The posts, and the troops which I
imagined would be ne∣cessary to occupy them, were specified merely to
shew that the number of 3000 was indispensibly requisite for the
defence of the province. The whole of that detail con∣curred with General
Carleton's requisitions for reinforcement, and with my reasoning upon
those requisitions; and when I assert, as I now do, that I never
presumed to suggest the necessity or propriety of forming a detail of
posts, (thus given for informa∣tion) <PB N="95" REF="101"/> into precise
orders for the general upon the spot, I am sure the secretary of state
will no more contradict that assertion than he has done any other I have
made.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">No. III.</NOTE>When in the same paper I
confidentially communicated my reasons for preferring certain corps to
others, I was actuated by the same principle of offering every opi∣nion that
could conduce to make the intended service effectual. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Apology for specifying corps.</NOTE>I thought it a
just claim in an arduous undertaking, to have my own choice of the troops;
and I am persuaded Sir Guy Carleton never took ill of me, either that claim,
or a subsequent one in the same paper, of being held free from any
imputation of delay, till I should be clear of the province of Quebec. With
an unfeigned confidence in Sir Guy Carle∣ton, I thought it a precaution fully
justifiable, to secure myself against others, in the numerous and
complicated departments under him, who might be found less equi∣table than he
is.</P>
<P>I know I have before complained of the production of these secret
communica∣tions; but after so many precedents as the last Session
furnished, of withholding parts of correspondences from Parliament, upon
the plea that they might affect in∣dividuals, the noble Lord's silence upon
those complaints, gives me a right still to comment upon the sinister
purposes that are to be ascribed to the production of that paper at length,
rather than by extract. Those purposes were various; but it must be
confessed one, and only one, good effect may result from a review of
them, viz. It may serve as a salutary caution to any officer, who shall
for the future be ad∣mitted into consultation with the same minister, how
he commits himself by an opi∣nion of men and things.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Remarkable circumstance respecting the
construction to be put up∣on my orders.</NOTE>The next point that I entered
upon previously to my narrative, was the tenor of my orders, and I believe it
was generally expected that the noble Lord would have taken some notice of
the fact I alledged, <HI>that every discretionary latitude which I had
proposed was erased, while the plan was in his hand.</HI> As his Lordship
had so much com∣mented upon the nature of peremptory orders, as a
<HI>general</HI> question, in my absence, it would have been fair in him to
have reasoned upon them after that important and decisive circumstance
was laid open.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The general opinion of the army upon forcing away
to Albany.</NOTE>The general idea <HI>of forcing a way to Albany,</HI> which
the army at its outset con∣ceived, by reasoning upon the apparent
principles of the campaign, without partici∣pation of the letter of the orders
is clear, from the general tenor of the evidence. I wished, it is true, to
have heard more copiously the sentiments of Sir Guy Carleton, because he
had full participation of the orders. From the temper and judgment that always
direct his conduct, he declined giving an opinion at the bar upon what might
become a question in the House. But I have since (upon request)
received his per∣mission to publish a letter from him to me, dated soon
after the Convention of Sara∣toga, <PB N="96" REF="102"/> which is in the
Appendix No. X. and with this reference I close my re∣view of the prefatory
matter which I laid before the Committee.</P>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="period">
<HEAD>Review of the first Period.</HEAD>
<P>Most of the circumstances stated in my Narrative respecting
the first period of the campaign, were, from their nature, to be
established by written testimony; and the papers, No. VII. and VIII. in
the Appendix, were added to those before produ∣ced for that purpose; 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Strength of the army.</NOTE>but the returns of the
troops, No. XI, are moreover au∣thenticated by the proper official authority,
the adjutant general, and the detail of the artillery, by the Major of brigade
in that department.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Proportion of artillery. Evidence of Capt.
Blom∣field, from quest. 4. to 9.</NOTE>From the evidence of the latter, is
also confirmed all that I advanced respecting the opinion and
recommendation of Major General Philips, for the proportion of artille∣ry
employed; for the moderate quantity of it, comparatively with the principles
and practice of other services, and for the great expected use of artillery
in the country where we were to act.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The uses of it. Captain Blomfield from
question 10 to 17. Evidence of Lord Balcar∣ras, from question 14. to 19.
Lord Balcar∣ras's cross examination, quest. 93, 94.</NOTE>Had these
opinions been merely speculative, the intelligence of the persons from whom
they came would have given them sufficient authority. But fortunately they
are verified by facts; for it appears from a multitude of evidence, that the
enemy made the true use of local advantages: they fortified every pass or
proper post: the nature of the country, and the necessity of keeping the
banks of rivers, made it impossible to turn those posts: had I wanted
therefore artillery, I could not have proceeded any given ten miles, but at a
heavy expence of my best troops. When it was found that I was provided with
that forcible arm, the enemy invariably quit∣ted their entrenchments, either to
retreat, or fight upon ground where they supposed artillery could be
least effectually employed. I am to thank the honourable member, whatever his
intentions might have been, who by his cross examination placed the
expediency of carrying the train I did, in so clear a view.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Lord Balcar∣ras, quest. 8. Lord Har∣rington,
question 4.</NOTE>The only remaining fact of the first period to which
verbal evidence is appli∣cable, viz. The impossibility of following the
enemy further than they were follow∣ed in their precipitate retreat from
Ticonderoga, is established by Lord Balcarras, and by Lord Harrington.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="period">
<HEAD>Review of the second Period.</HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">March from Skenesbo∣rough to Fort
Edward.</NOTE>In entering upon the evidence which respects the first
transaction of the se∣cond period, viz. the march from Skenesborough to
Fort Edward, I cannot help <PB N="97" REF="103"/> observing how much of the
blame imputed to me has been occasioned by misrepre∣sentation from
persons whose business it was to decry my actions; 
<NOTE PLACE="marg"> Mistakes in geography.</NOTE>and by uncom∣mon
mistakes in the geography of the country by those to whom my actions were
misrepresented. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg"> Lord Balcar∣ras, quest. 90.</NOTE>By the
cross examination of Lord Balcarras it must be supposed, that the
persons who suspected I erred in not taking the route by <HI>South
Bay</HI> after the success at Ticonderoga, did not know where <HI>South
Bay</HI> was. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Question 91.</NOTE>They seem equally ig∣norant
of the situation of <HI>Pitch-pine Plains,</HI> by the question immediately
following the former one; and it must have been a surprise to the
enquirers to find that the route which they were inclined to approve, was
precisely that which the main body of the army took under me in person, and
with such effect, as to come up with the rear of the enemy and drive them
from their fortified post at Skenesborough, with the loss on their part
of five armed vessels and all the rest of their water-craft.</P>
<P>But it may be said, this part of the cross-examination, though
incomprehensible in point of geography, still applied to the question
taken notice of in my narrative, viz. 
<Q REND="inline">"Whether it would not have been more expedient to
return to Ticonderago, and take the route by Lake George, than to proceed, as I
did, by the Pitch Pine Plains to Fort Edward?"</Q></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Sir Guy Car∣leton, quest. 9, 10.</NOTE>I
shall not recapitulate the various motives I have before stated in
support of that preference, having publickly in my favour the opinion of an
officer so enlightened in military science, and so well acquainted with
the country as Sir Guy Carleton;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See also the map of
country.</NOTE> and never having heard a difference of opinion in any other
officer of a like description, to rest much more upon a subject so
supported by reasoning and by success, might be construed an attempt
to divert the attention of my examiners from points less de∣fensible. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Considerable time gained by the army taking the
route to Fort Edward by land.</NOTE><NOTE PLACE="marg">Captain Mo∣ney, quest.
4 to quest. 11. Lieut. Col. Kingston, quest. 23.</NOTE>I therefore
shall only add two short remarks; the one, that the fact of gaining
considerable time by allotting the whole service of the water-craft to the
transport of provision and stores over Lake George, instead of
employing great part of it for the transport of the troops is incontestably
proved by the evidence of Cap∣tain Money and Lieutenant Colonel Kingston: the
other, that to have reached Fort Edward with the troops sooner than the 29th
of July (the day that the first em∣barkation of provisions arrived at Fort
George) would not only have been useless, but also highly impolitic;
because the subsistence of the troops at Fort Edward, be∣fore the
arrival of that embarkation, must have been brought by land carriage through
much difficult road all the way from Fort Anne, when, on the contrary, by
remaining in the neighbourhood of Skenesborough till the passage of Lake
George was effected, exclusively of the considerations of covering the
removal of the ho∣spital of Huberton, and alarming the Connecticut by the
position of General Reide∣sel's corps, the army was commodiously
supplied by water-carriage.</P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="104"/> The next circumstance for examination,
according to the order of the Narrative, is the transport of the magazines of
provisions, &amp;c. from Fort George; and it is highly incumbent upon me to
shew the difficulties of that operation, because, if they were avoidable,
it must be acknowledged one of the principal grounds upon which I vindicate
the plan of the expedition to Bennington will fail me.</P>
<P>But I am persuaded, every candid examiner will first indulge me
in a short pause. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The charges brought against the Lt. General's
conduct at this part of the cam∣paign.</NOTE>It will be recollected, that this
is the only part of the campaign upon which the no∣ble Lord has laid his
finger, as judging it productive of the subsequent events. The
cross-examination had already been pressed upon the same ideas. Such
want of know∣ledge of the nature of transport in that country has been
betrayed; so much prepos∣session of unnecessary delays has
appeared; 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Survey of his difficulties and
anxieties</NOTE>such emphasis of question has attended every
circumstance of my conduct at this period, that I shall stand acquitted
of pro∣lixity, if I preface the application of the subsequent evidence by a
more comprehen∣sive and complete survey of the difficulties and anxieties
of my situation than I thought was necessary before.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Feeding the army.</NOTE>The combination of
arrangement for feeding the army might, in fact, be stated to have extended
even to Ireland; for some part of the supply depended upon the vic∣tualling
fleet which was prepared in that country, according to my requisition before
I left London, and had not reached Quebec when the army took the field. The
te∣diousness of the navigation from Quebec to the mouth of the Sorel need
not be again described. The next embarrassment was to manage the
conveyance for that part of the supply which came from Montreal, and which
was much the greatest, without interfering with the transport which with
equal necessity was to be expedited up the Saint Lawrence to Lake Ontario,
for the service of Colonel St. Leger's expedition, and the immense stores
(then necessarily upon the move also) for the winter main∣tenance of the
upper country. To these might be added a list of chances and
incon∣veniences, incident to the carrying places between Chamblée and
Saint John's; the uncertaintainty afterwards of the passage over Lake
Champlain, and Lake George; the laborious and slow operations of drawing the
boats over the isthmus which di∣vides the two Lakes. These together make a
system of embarrassments and disap∣pointments hardly to be conceived
by those who have not experienced them:</P>
<P>But although the whole of this arrangement (the furnishing the
upper country ex∣cepted) was made under my direction, I have been content to
date my difficulties from the lodgement of the supplies at Fort George; and I
have touched the other parts only to shew more perspicuously the
unfairness of judging of an American cam∣paign upon European ideas. How
zealously soever a general, in such an undertak∣ing as mine, may be
served by the chiefs of departments (and much praise is due 
<PB N="99" REF="105"/> from me upon that score) for one hour he can find to
contemplate <HI>how he shall fight his army, he must allot twenty to
contrive how to feed it.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Behaviour of the Indians.</NOTE>The behaviour of
the Indians is a circumstance too material to be passed over in a review
of the anxieties in this part of the campaign. I had discerned the caprice,
the superstition, the self-interestedness of the Indian character
from my first intercourse, even with those nations which are supposed
to have made the greatest progress towards civilization: I mean with
those called the domiciliated nations near Montreal. I had been taught to
look upon the remote tribes who joined me at Skenesboroug, as more warlike;
but a very little time proved that, with equal depravity in general principle,
their only pre-eminence consisted in ferocity. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lord Har∣rington from quest. 6 to 23.</NOTE>The
hopes I had placed in their wild honour, and in the controul of their
conductors, which, as I stated before, at first had been promising, were
soon at an end; and their ill-humour and mutinous disposition were
manifest soon after my arrival at Fort Edward. The apparent causes of
their change of temper were the resentment I had shewn upon the murder of
Miss Macrea, and the restraints I had laid on their disposition to
commit other enormities; but I never doubted that their evil passions were
fomented, and their defection completed by the cabals of the Canadian
interpreters. Rapacity, self-interest, and presumption are the
characteristics of these men, with some few exceptions. The acquisition
of the Indian language has usually been a certain fortune to a man with an
artful head and a convenient conscience.</P>
<P>To check the old practices of peculation in these men, Sir Guy
Carleton, with great judgment, had given the superintendency of the Indian
department to Major Campbell and Captain Frazer, gentlemen of the highest
integrity. The British officers employed solely in the military conduct of
that department, were also selected with equal pro∣priety. The interpreters
had from the first regarded with a jealous eye a system which took out of
their hands the distribution of Indian necessaries and presents; but
when they found the plunder of the country, as well as that of the government,
was controuled, the profligate policy of many was employed to promote
dissention, revolt, and desertion.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">St. Luc.</NOTE>I take this occasion to acquit
Monsieur St. Luc of any suspicion of his being con∣cerned in these
factions; but I believe he discerned them. He certainly knew that the Indians
pined after a renewal of their accustomed horrors; and that they were be∣come
as impatient of his controul as of all other, though the pride and interest
of authority, and the affection he bore to his old associates, induced him
to cover the real causes under various frivolous pretences of discontent,
with which I was daily tor∣mented, but to which I constantly attended: and
though I differed totally with Saint Luc in opinion upon the efficacy of
these allies, I invariably took his advice in the <PB N="100" REF="106"/>
management of them, even to an indulgence of their most capricious fancies,
when they did not involve the dishonour of the King's service and the
disgrace of huma∣nity. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lord Har∣rington's qu. last re∣ferred
to.</NOTE>The council of the 4th of August was held at his pressing
instance; and in that council, to my great astonishment (for he had given
me no intimation of the de∣sign) the tribes with which he was most
particularly connected, and for whom he in∣terpreted, declared their intention
of returning home, and demanded my concurrence and assistance. The
embarrassment of this event was extreme. By acquiescing, I voluntary
relinquished part of my force that had been obtained with immense charge to
government, that had created high expectation at home and abroad, and that
in∣deed my own army was by no means in condition to dispense with;
because, depend∣ing upon the supposed assistance of this much
over-valued race for scouts and out∣posts, and all the lesser, but
necessary services, for giving due repose to the camp, the British
light-infantry had been trained to higher purposes: they were destined to
lead in the general and decisive combats I expected in the woods, and could
not be spared, or risked, or harrassed, without palpable consequences
of the most disagree∣able kind.</P>
<P>On the contrary, I was convinced a cordial reconciliation with the
Indians was only to be effected by a renunciation of all my former prohibitions
and an indulgence in blood and rapine: I had not a friend in the department in
whom I could confide except Major Campbell, Captain Frazer, and the other
British officers: their ignorance of the languages, and the very probity of
their characters, rendered them of no weight in Indian councils. An answer,
nevertheless, was to be made upon the moment; and the part I took was to give
a firm refusal to their proposition, and to adhere to the controuls I had
before established; but, with a temperate representation of the ties of
faith, of generosity, and honour, to join every other argument consistent
with those principles which I could devise, to persuade and encourage
them to continue their services.</P>
<P>This speech appeared to have the desired effect. The tribes
nearest home affected to separate from the others, and only pressed for
permission to return in parties to gather in their harvest, proposing
to relieve each other; which was granted. Some of the remote tribes also
seemed to retract their propositions, and professed a zeal for the
service; but the desertion took place the next day by scores, loaded with
such plunder as they had collected; and it continued from day to day, till
scarce a man that had joined at Skenesborough remained. This whole
transaction, I aver, was before the plan of Bennington was formed. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg"> Lord Har∣rington's qu. last referred to. &amp;

for elucidating different subjects; and the precise date could have been 
<PB N="101" REF="107"/> further supported by a memorandum of Sir Francis

notorious.</P>
<P>That Monsieur St. Luc, anxious for the credit of his favourite
troops, and invited by the propensity he found in the minister to listen
to any whispered intelligence, in contradiction to that he received from the
General himself; that, under these tempta∣tions, that wily partizan
should misplace dates, and confound causes, neither surprises nor
offends me. With this exposition of fact, I leave him in full

present age, and universally abhorred by posterity.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">German troops.</NOTE>But to proceed to the
survey of other difficulties of the time. Great attention was due to the
management of the German troops.</P>
<P>The mode of war in which they were engaged was entirely new to them;
tempta∣tions to desert were in themselves great, and had been enhanced and
circulated among them by emissaries of the enemy with much art and
industry. Jealousy of predilection in the allotment of posts and
separate commands ever subsists among troops of different states; and
a solid preference of judgment in the commander in chief often appears a
narrow national partiality.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Character of M. G. Reide∣sel.</NOTE>I confess
I was much assisted in maintaining cordiality in an army thus composed,
by the frank, spirited, and honourable character I had to deal with in Major
General Reidesel;—a character which was very early impressed upon
my mind, and which no trials of intricacy, danger, and distress, has
since effaced; but address was still requisite to second his zeal,
and to diffuse it through the German ranks; and I studied to throw them
into situations that might give them confidence in them∣selves, credit with
their prince, and alacrity in the pursuit of an enterprise, which, when its
difficulties were considered, in fact required enthusiasm.</P>
<P>Other parts of the alliance, though not liable to suspicion of
treachery, like the Indians, nor of consequence to be so much attended to
as the Germans, neverthe∣less had their perplexities. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Cana∣dian troops.</NOTE>The Canadians, were
officered by gentlemen of great <PB N="102" REF="108"/> condition in their
country, but were not to be depended upon. Instead of the enter∣prising and
daring spirit which distinguished the character of that people under the
French government, was substituted a longing after home, the effect of
disuse of arms and long habits of domestic enjoyments; and this
disease <HI>(mal de payz)</HI> is carried in them to a greater proverbial
extreme than in any other people to whom the term is more commonly applied.</P>
<P>It was neither easy to keep these people together, nor to
support the ideas of re∣spect which the enemy entertained of them from the
remembrance of the former war. The only manner of effecting the latter
purpose was to shew them occasionally at a distance, but rarely to
commit them upon parties where they were likely to fall in with the best
classes of the Rangers opposed to us: perhaps there are few better in the
world than the corps of Virginia Riflemen, which acted under Colonel
Morgan.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Provincial corps.</NOTE>The Provincial Corps, of
which I had two in embryo, and several detached par∣ties, were yet a heavier
tax upon time and patience. They were composed of pro∣fessed Loyalists,
many of whom had taken refuge in Canada the preceding winter, and others had
joined as we advanced. The various interests which influenced their actions
rendered all arrangement of them impracticable. One man's views went to the
profit which he was to enjoy when his corps should be complete; another's, to
the protection of the district in which he resided; a third was wholly
intent upon revenge against his personal enemies; and all of them were
repugnant even to an idea of subordination. Hence the settlement who
should act as a private man, and who as an officer, or in whose corps
either should be, was seldom satisfactorily made among themselves; and
as surely as it failed, succeeded a reference to the Com∣mander in Chief,
which could not be put by, or delegated to another hand, with∣out
dissatisfaction, encrease of confusion, and generally a loss of
such services as they were really fit for, <HI>viz.</HI> searching for
cattle, ascertaining the practicability of routes, clearing roads, and
guiding detachments or columns upon the march.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I would
not be understood to infer, that none of the Provincials with me were
sincere in their loyalty; perhaps many were so. A few were of
distinguished bravery, among which it would be unjust not to
particularize Mr. Fistar, who fell at Bennington, and Capt. Sherwood, who was
forward in every service of danger to the end of the campaign. I only
maintain that the interests and the passions of the revolted Americans
concenter in the cause of the Congress; and those of the Loyalists
break and subdivide into various pursuits, with which the cause of the
King has little or nothing to do.</NOTE></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Other critical embarrass∣ments.</NOTE>Such were
the embarrassments of my mind, added to the many necessary avoca∣tions
of command purely military. It will likewise be remembered that Lieutenant
Colonel St. Leger was, at this time, before Fort Stanwix: every hour was
pregnant with critical events. The candid and unprejudiced, reflecting upon
such a situa∣tion, will check the readiness of their censure: far be it
from me to contend that I did not commit many errors: I only hope to have
proved, that they are not those <PB N="103" REF="109"/> which have yet been
specifically pointed at, and whatever blame may be imputable to me in other
instances, my late examiners are not justly intitled to triumph on any of
their discoveries.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Expedition to Benning∣ton.</NOTE>And now for the
expedition to Bennington as it stands upon evidence.</P>
<P>The questions upon the cross examination are so explanatory of
the hints which fell from the noble Lord afterwards, that one would almost
imagine the hints were originally designed to precede. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Faults sup∣posed.</NOTE>It will be regular for
me, therefore, to consider them in that manner, and, from the whole I am to
collect, that the faults meant to be established are, that I employed
Germans to sound the disposition of a coun∣try in which no Germans
resided: that the mounting dragoons was unnecessary: that the range given
to the expedition was too great: that it was not originally designed for
Bennington: that the force was inadequate.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Fault of em∣ploying Ger∣mans, Lord Harrington,

first of these charges, relative to the employment of Germans, it would be
waste of time to add to the full answer given by Lord Harrington. Co∣lonel
Kingston has answered the question respecting the mounting the
dragoons; and moreover it will be remembered, that the collecting horses was
by no means confined to that service. They were requisite for carrying the
baggage of the army, as expressed in the instructions to Colonel Baume,
to the amount of 1500. This circumstance may have struck some gentlemen,
as confirming the idea that the bag∣gage attending the army was of enormous
bulk. I request a suspence of judgment upon this article, till I come to
the proper place of explanation; and I revert to the part of the charge which
seems of most importance, viz. the extent of the march, as described in
the Instructions, compared with the strength of the detachment,
&amp;c.<NOTE PLACE="marg"> See the In∣structions and all other papers
re∣specting Ben∣nington. No. IV.</NOTE></P>
<P>It can hardly escape observation, what strength to my defence
upon this point may be derived from advocates who were not expected to appear
in my behalf. For I take support from the noble Lord himself, and all who
have believed in his late assertions, or adhered to his favourite
doctrines, by pleading that I undertook the expedition to Bennington upon
report, strengthened by the suggestion of <HI>persons of long
experience and residence in America; who had been present on the spot
when the rebel∣lion broke out;</HI> and whose information had been much
respected by the administration in England; <HI>that the friends to the
British cause were as five to one,</HI> and that they <HI>wanted only the
appearance of a protecting force to shew themselves.</HI> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The ground of the under∣taking to Bennington
supported by the doctrine of Lord G. Germain.</NOTE>Some criticisers upon
the adequacy of the force I employed, may desert the cause of the noble
Lord; but will <HI>He</HI> maintain, that a recruit of force from the enemy's
country was a wild expectation, when the recruiters, provincial colonels,
governors, land pro∣prietors, and popular leaders of the party who glory in the
designation of Tory, were upon the spot, and personally interested in
the levies? <HI>He</HI> must surely stand forth my advocate in this
point, or entirely forget the reasoning he held to Sir Wil∣liam 
<PB N="104" REF="110"/> Howe, when without the advantages of such recruiters;
against the belief of the General himself; unprepared to repair the
disappointment, if disappoint∣ment ensued, in a measure of so much
more magnitude, and so much less real en∣couragement, <HI>He</HI> referred
to that expedient of recruiting from the enemy, what he had not strength to
supply from the national troops.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"> 
<P>In a letter from Lord George Germain to Sir William Howe, dated

<P> 
<Q REND="inline">If we may credit the accounts which arrive from

offensive operations.</Q></P> 
<P>The whole of the letter, from which the above is an extract, is
curious, and may be seen in the Parliamentary Register, No.
68.</P></NOTE></P>
<P>This I must insist is an unanswerable defence, with
respect to the noble Lord, and those who think with him; for it is strict
and positive coincidence with their opi∣nions, past and present—and
if I said it will be so with those to come, my prophecy would be
authorized by the conviction and triumph which Mr. Galway's evidence,
respecting the loyalty of the Americans, seemed to produce in the parties
to whom I allude.</P>
<P>But in due respect to other judges, it is incumbent upon me to
state a more se∣rious defence.</P>
<P>As Lieutenant Colonel Kingston cannot prove juridically that the
rough draft of the design which ended the affair of Bennington was the same
which was deliver∣ed by General Reidesel, and I am unwilling upon memory to
incur a possibility of mistake, even in an immaterial circumstance that
respects an absent friend, I am content it should be considered as an
uncertaintainty, and I drop all use that could be drawn from the original
composition. It will fully answer my purpose to adhere to the bare
assertion which I am sure will never be contradicted, that Major Gene∣ral
Reidesel originally conceived an expedition for the purpose of mounting his
dragoons, and supplying the troops in general with baggage-horses; that I
thought his idea might be extended to much greater use, and that the plan was
considered, amended, and enlarged, in concert with him. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lieut. Col. Kingston's quest.</NOTE>Therefore
upon the abstract ground and reason of the measure, I might urge, that it
was supported by naked military principle, according to the sentiments of a
general of great natural talents, and long service under the first
masters of the age. It is proved, that the same sen∣timents were ratified
by the full approbation of Major General Phillips, an officer of similar
description, to whom the plan was communicated; and if a single part of the
same plan, mentioned to be at first disapproved by Brigadier General
Frazer, continued to be so after explanation, that disapprobation did not
appear. In∣deed the utmost that can be drawn from the evidence of Lieutenant
Colonel <PB N="105" REF="111"/> Kingston, or any other witness, amounts to
no more than an implied wish in the Brigadier to have conducted the
expedition at the head of his distinct corps. It was the fact. Devoted to
glory and prodigal of life; earnest for the general success of the
campaign, and particularly anxious for every plan adopted by the man he loved,
he grudged a danger or care in other hands than his own. It was not envy or
dis∣paragement of the German troops, but zeal and impatience for employment,
that influenced his predilection for the British. I honoured the principle,
while I re∣strained it; and I reserved his ardour and judgment for a
second movement, which required those qualities much more than the
expedition to Bennington did, according to any intelligence or appearance of
things at the time. It will be ob∣served from the evidence, that the whole of
Brigadier Fraser's corps was thrown over the river, and actually posted at
the opening of the plain near Saratoga, when Col. Baume marched; and the
design was, upon the first news of Baume's success, to have pushed
that corps to take possession of the heights near Stillwater, and to
have intrenched there, till the army and the provision could have joined, by
which means the whole country on the west side the river, to the banks of
the Mohawk, would have been our own.</P>
<P>But moreover it is to be observed, that Major General Reidesel
was far from being ignorant, as has been suggested, of the nature of the
country, or the professions of the inhabitants. He was just returned from
commanding a detached corps at a considerable distance from the main army,
in the very heart of the country from which the enemy's force at Bennington was
afterwards supplied. He spoke the English language well; he was
assisted by many natives of the best information.</P>
<P>It is evident, that the brave but deceived officer who commanded the
detach∣ment, was induced to deviate from the cautions prescribed in the
instructions. A plan drawn by an engineer upon the spot is added to the
evidence produced to the committee, to shew more clearly where that deviation
happened. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lord Har∣rington's q. 28 to 31.</NOTE>It appears
also in proof, that the measures taken to relieve Colonel Baume, upon the
news of his difficulty, were the most speedy that could be used, and
would have been time∣ly, had not Colonel Brieman's march been more tardy than
could have been supposed possible. I take the fact as stated in his
own account, without impeaching his cre∣dit with regard to the obstacles he
describes. But as a farther vindication of the intelligence and principle
upon which the original strength of the detachment was framed, and the mere
accident which made even error possible, I request admis∣sion for the
proof of a new fact which I did not know it was in my power to bring, till
after Captain Money had left the bar of the House of Commons; and as I was
precluded from calling him a second time, by the abrupt close of the
proceedings, I had no other way of laying it before the public, than by
stating the question in <PB N="106" REF="112"/> writing, and requiring his
authority to publish the answer, which I obtained, and they are as
follows:</P>
<P>Q. Do you know any circumstance respecting an unexpected
reinforcement re∣ceived by the rebels at Bennington near the time of the
action?</P>
<P>A. 
<Q REND="inline">"A few days after I was prisoner in the rebel
camp, some of their officers told me, that it was a providential
circumstance, that General Starks was coming through Bennington with 1200
militia of the New-Hampshire Grants, to join their main army near Albany, for
the guard on the provision at Bennington did not amount to more than 400 men;
and that on his hearing of a detachment of our army being only four or five
miles from him, he with the guard, and what militia could be collected in the
neighbourhood, attacked and defeated the de∣tachment, as well as the
reinforcement that were on their march to join them. The rebel officers also
informed me, and I have seen accounts that agree with what I then heard, that
during the action General Starks was 'luckily' joined by Colonel Warner with a
considerable body of men. I have frequently heard our officers say that
were in this action, that had Colonel Baume retreated four miles, and
recrossed the river he passed the day before, and taken post there,
when he found by information he could not proceed, and had wrote for a
rein∣forcement, he would have met Colonel Breiman coming to his
assistance, and would not have risqued the loss of his corps, which
by his instructions were so strongly recommended, as not even to risque
a considerable loss. This, Sir, is as nearly as possible the answer I
should have given had the question been asked me in the House of
Commons.—J. Money."</Q></P>
<P>This piece of evidence will serve to shew that it was not the
success of the rebels at Bennington that animated the militia to
assemble, and march in the cause of the Congress; and he must be of
steady faith indeed in American loyalty who can suppose much of it really
existed in the country of the Hampshire Grants (howsoever it had been
affected and professed) when he reflects, not only that General Starks and
Colonel Warner were not opposed in collecting their men, though my army, then
in a tide of success, were near at hand; but also that not a loyalist
was found earnest enough to convey me intelligence.</P>
<P>It will likewise appear, from this piece of evidence, when
compared with the map of the country and the disposition of the troops,
that had not the accidental passage of the detachments under Starks and
Warner been exceedingly critical, it could not have availed.—Forty-eight
hours sooner, they would have joined General Gates; and he would hardly have
detached them, or any other part of his force, back to Benning∣ton, even though
he had heard of a movement to my left; because he must have known that the
whole of Fraser's corps lay ready to march rapidly upon him from my 
<PB N="107" REF="113"/> right.—Forty-eight hours later, the blow would
have been struck; and the stores, consisting of live cattle, and
flower, with abundant carriages to convey it, would have been out of reach.</P>
<P>Another reflection will be apt to arise in speculative minds
upon this subject, viz. on what nice chances depends the reputation of an
officer who acts under sel∣fish and ungenerous employers! Such men not only
with-hold the fair protection that would arise from an explanation of his
motives, but are the first to join the cry of the uninformed multitude, who
always judge by events. Thus every plan receives a colouring in the extreme;
and is denominated (often with equal injustice) a fatal error or a brilliant
enterprize.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cross-exa∣mination of Lord Har∣rington, q.
89.</NOTE>But it still may be said, the expedition was not originally
designed against Ben∣nington. I really do not see to what it could tend
against me, if that supposition were in a great degree admitted. That
some part of the force was designed to act there, will not be disputed by
any who read Colonel Baume's instructions, and con∣sult the map. The blame
or merit of the design altogether, must rest upon the mo∣tives of
expediency; and it is of little consequence whether the first and principal
di∣rection was against Bennington, or Arlington, or any other district, as
my intelligence might have varied respecting the deposits of corn and
cattle of the enemy. At the same time I must observe it is begging the
question, to argue that Bennington was not the real, original object,
because Bennington was not mentioned in the draft of in∣structions. A man
must indeed be void of military and political address, to put upon paper a
critical design, where surprize was in question, and every thing depended
upon secresy. Though it were true, that I meant only Bennington, and
thought of nothing less than the progress of the expedition, in the extent
of the order, I certainly would not now affirm it, because I could not prove
it; and because it would seem, that I searched for remote and obscure
justification, not re∣lying upon that which was manifest; but surely
there is nothing new or improbable in the idea, that a general should
disguise his real intentions at the outset of an expedi∣tion, even from
the officer whom he appointed to execute them, provided a commu∣nication with
that officer was certain and not remote.</P>
<P>This review of the affair of Bennington, tho' long, I trust will
not be deemed mis∣placed; and from the different parts of it, I think, will
clearly be established the few following assertions.</P>
<P>1st. That the design upon Bennington was justified by the
circumstances of the time.</P>
<P>2d. That there was no reason to suppose the force of the enemy
there greater than what the detachment was adequate to defeat.</P>
<P>3d. That when the force was discovered to be greater, the ill
consequences would have been avoided had not Colonel Baume deviated from his
instructions, by commit∣ting <PB N="108" REF="114"/> his regular force in the
woods instead of fortifying a post in the open country, and exploring the
woods only with the Indians, Canadians, and Provincials, supported by Captain
Fraser's corps, who were complete masters of such business.</P>
<P>4th. That after Colonel Baume had committed that error, it would
have been re∣trieved had Colonel Brieman's reinforcement accomplished their
march in the time they ought to have done.</P>
<P>5th. That the strength of the enemy was merely accidental.</P>
<P>And, as a final observation, I will add, that when a minister
states a common acci∣dent of war, independent of any general action,
unattended with any loss that could affect the main strength of the army,
and little more than the miscarriage of a forag∣ing party, to have been fatal
to a whole campaign, of which he had directed the pro∣gress and apportioned
the force, he makes but an ill compliment to his own judgment.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Difficulty of forming a magazine af∣ter the
disap∣pointment at Bennington. Lieut. Col. Kingston, q. 24 to 31.</NOTE>The
next class of proofs in regular progression, applies to the difficulty of
bringing forward a magazine of provision, after the disappointment of
obtaining live stock and flower at Bennington. It has been shewn, by the
evidence of Captain Money, Lieu∣tenant Colonel Kingston, and the authentic
memorandums of Sir Francis Clarke, that early in the month of August it was
no easy task to supply the daily consumption of the army. Our powers
were afterwards, in some degree, encreased by the arrival of more contract
horses, acquisitions of more ox-teams from the country, and the great
vigilance exerted in the departments of the quarter-master-general and
inspector, whose assistants had been augmented.</P>
<P>A minute investigation of this operation I am sensible will be
thought dry, and perhaps unnecessary, by general readers—they will
pass it over—but there are those who have laid much stress upon a
waste of time, and who take delight in tracing the small parts of a

computes, (and his computation tallies nearly with the table formed by the
Commissary-General) that five days provision, viz. four for forming the
magazine and one for daily consump∣tion, was the most that could be
conveyed at once.</P>
<P>To bring this to an average I will assume only two days for
accidents of weather, roads, fatigue of cattle, breaking of carriages, and
other common disappointments: this is much less time than according to the
evidence might be allowed, and upon This computation it would take ten days to
convey the magazine to Fort Edward only. <PB N="109" REF="115"/> The stage
from thence to the encampment and intended depositary must not be computed
by distance but by impediments. The rapids of the river and the different
carrying∣places have been described by the witnesses, and it results
that this stage was much longer in point of time than the former one. It was
not possible to keep the transports going at both stages together for
the ten days mentioned, because there were not boats in the river
sufficient for more than the daily supply; nor could they have been
conveyed there in that time by any possible means, for these reasons;
the boat carriages, which were of a construction similar to timber
carriages used in England, were only twelve in number, and each carriage
employed six horses or four oxen to draw it; and could any other means of
draft for boats over land have been contrived, or cattle have been supplied
from the artillery, or any other department, all would have been useless;
be∣cause the boats themselves, to a greater amount than those above
specified, were wanting till after the whole of the provision transport
between Ticonderoga and Fort George, upon which they were employed, was
finished, and it had barely kept pace so as to supply the land
transport between Fort George and Fort Edward.</P>
<P>I desire only an allowance of fifteen days for the carriage over
the second stage, and it will thus take, in the whole, twenty-five days to
form the magazine alone.</P>
<P>I claim no additional allowance of time for conveying one hundred
boats, at least, through the difficulties of land and water, in the two
stages, but comprise that labour among the rest of the last fifteen
days. It must be nevertheless observed, that even this number was short
of what was wanting, and, to save time, all the artificers were employed in
building scouls (fourteen of which were finished during the trans∣port)
to make water craft, in the whole sufficient to carry the magazine forward,
after the communication should be at an end. The new caulking the boats,
though indispen∣sibly necessary to great part of them, after
passing the lakes loaded, and afterwards being shaken and damaged by land
carriage, is another work which I throw into the last fifteen days of the
transport, or into the subsequent four days, which must at the least
be allotted for loading the magazine, and arranging the order of its proceeding
both in respect to navigation and defence. This was committed to very expert
naval officers, and was matter of no trivial concern, or easy execution.</P>
<P>The whole business, according to the above representation and
calculation, both which are founded upon evidence, would have taken twenty-nine
days: twenty-seven only were employed, viz. from August the 16th to
September the 13th. The exertions in fact, outwent the calculation; and I
challenge the most minute specula∣tists, to try the time and the powers
we possessed, by every possible distribution of carriages and
cattle, different from that which was practised, and I will venture to say
none will be found less dilatory.</P>
<P>It appears clearly in proof, that no impediment to this transport
was occasioned by the interference of the artillery; but it has been implied
by some questions in the cross <PB N="110" REF="116"/> examinations, that
if the artillery did not interfere with the transport, the transport ought
to have interfered with the artillery, and that by appropriating their horses
to the provision train, much time might have been saved.</P>
<P>It might be a sufficient answer, that the artillery, for the
reasons I have before assigned was not to be dispensed with, and
consequently the horses were to be preserved: but I besides have
shewn, that they could not have been of use to the transport of the
boats; and to satisfy every scruple, and to shew how mistaken they are
who suppose an advantage was to be obtained by the employment of artillery
horses to convey pro∣visions, I now offer to their reflection the
additional fact, that they could have been of no avail, because we had
neither carts nor pack-saddles, more than were in use already.</P>

<P>Having thus shewn that the transport of provision and other
stores, for about thirty days, was effected in the shortest time
possible, it now becomes necessary to examine <PB N="111" REF="117"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Question made, whe∣ther the army might not have
proceed∣ed to Albany without stores? Idea of a rapid march.</NOTE>the
question, which has been very much canvassed in print, and by the cross
exami∣nation, appears to have made impression upon some gentlemen;
whether this prepara∣tion might not have been dispensed with, and the army
have reached Albany by a ra∣pid march, the soldiers carrying upon their backs
a sufficiency of provision to support them during the time.</P>
<P>It is very natural for men of all descriptions, to apply the idea
of a rapid march to a distance of fifty miles, for it is not more measuring
in a streight line from Fort Ed∣ward to Albany, and it will be proper to
consider the principle and practibility of such march, with respect to
two distinct periods, the one before, the other after the at∣tempt upon
Bennington.</P>
<P>With respect to the first, it will be remembered, that in the
state the roads then were, and with the resources then to be employed, no
provision before-hand was attainable. Therefore, to have brought the plan of
a rapid advance within the compass of a possibility, the operation must
have begun by marching the whole rapidly backward, in order to load the men
with their packs of provisions. How the troops, zealous as they were, would
have relished a step so uncommon in its nature, and productive of so
much unexpected fatigue, particularly how the Ger∣mans would have been so
persuaded of the necessity as to have undertaken it with good will,
cannot be ascertained.</P>
<P>But these doubts apart, it remains to be considered, how the
troops were to pass two very large rivers, the Hudson and the Mohawk,
without previous provision for a bridge, or water-craft for conveying large
bodies at once. Every concession a sanguine projector can desire
shall be made upon this point also; the contrivance of rafts, bound
together by twigs and strips of bark, as in fact was practised at this very
period for the passage of Fraser's corps over Hudson's River, shall
be admitted equally practicable for the whole army; and in argument be it
trusted to chance to pass the Mohawk in the same way; or should it
fail, let recourse be had to the ford, which is known to be practicable,
<HI>except after heavy rains,</HI> near Schenectady, about fifteen miles from
the mouth of the river.</P>
<P>These concessions granted, we will suppose the army on the
bank of the Hudson's River, where they afterwards passed it.</P>
<P>The idea of a rapid march will of course be exempt from all
thought of personal incumbrances (provision exempted) and the soldier
will stand represented in the imagination, trim and nimble as he is seen
at an exercise in an English encamp∣ment—Indeed <PB N="112" REF="118"/> it is necessary he should be considered in that form; for
nothing can be more repugnant to a project of rapidity, than the soldier's
load, were he to carry all the articles belonging to him in a campaign.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">They consist of a knapsack, containing his bodily
necessaries, a blanket, a haversack with provisions, a carteen, a
hatchet, and a fifth share of the general camp equipage belonging to his
tent. These arti∣cles (reckoning the provision to be for four days) added
to his accountrements, arms, and sixty rounds of ammunition, make a bulk
totally incompatible with combat, and a weight of about sixty
pounds.</NOTE></P>
<P>But it may be said, and with truth, that troops are usually
relieved from a con∣siderable part of this burthen, and many examples of this
relief may be brought from the general custom of service, and from many
movements of General Howe's army in particular—nay more, it was a
frequent practice of the very army in ques∣tion, to march free from
knapsacks and camp equipage. The Wigwam, or hut constructed of boughs, may
be made a very wholesome substitute for a tent; and when victual can be
cooked before-hand, even the camp kettle for an expeditious march may be laid
aside. All these examples are admitted: but they all imply conveniencies
for the several articles to follow, and to be brought up in due time. In our
case they must have been lost irrecoverably.</P>
<P>Will it be argued, that some medium might have been devised? And
although it were impossible, consistently with the idea of rapidity, to
carry forward more provision than for bare sustenance during the march,
yet carts might have been found sufficient to carry the men's knapsacks,
and camp kettles, and other indispen∣sible articles? This supposition
would betray a great ignorance of the country. From Saratoga to Albany there is
only one road practicable for wheel carriage. There are many places where by
destroying the bridges over deep gullies which dis∣charge themselves into
the main river, a passage would be rendered impossible, not only for a
wheel carriage, but a horse. There are others where the road is bounded by
the river on one side, and by almost perpendicular ascents covered with
wood on the other. Here the very short work of felling a few trees would
stop all passage. The expence of time to remove these obstructions,
or to make new roads, would have brought famine. All notion, therefore, of
conveying any articles more than could be carried upon men's shoulders must
cease. The notion of artillery, even the smal∣lest pieces, must also
cease of course, not even a little ammunition-tumbril could have found its
way.—An easy sacrifice to the theorists, who have maintained the
inutility of artillery: but any officer who has seen the ground of this
supposed march, would point out a dozen passes, not to speak of the
passage of the Mohawk, where, strengthened with abattis and such other
works as the rebels are expert in making in a very few hours, five hundred
militia would stop for a time, ten times their number of the best troops in
the world who had not artillery to assist them.</P>
<P><PB N="113" REF="119"/> Having stated these objections to the
principle of a rapid march, let us now, from the knowledge that has been
since obtained of circumstances, consider what would have been the
certain consequences of the attempt.</P>
<P>Those who are acquainted with the capricious workings of the
tempers of men, will not wonder at the difficulty of prevailing upon a common
soldier in any exi∣gency to husband his provisions. In a settled camp,
the young soldier has very short fare on the fourth day after delivery: but
upon a march in bad weather and bad roads, when the weary foot slips back at
every step, and a general curse is provoked at the weight that causes the
retardment, he must be a patient veteran, and of much experience in
scarcity, who is not tempted to throw the whole con∣tents of the haversack
into the mire. He feels the present incumbrance grievous—Want is a day
remote.— 
<Q REND="inline">"Let the General find a supply: it is the King's
cause and the General's interest—he will never let the soldier be
starved."</Q></P>
<P>This is common reasoning in the ranks. I state it for those
who have not seen fatiguing service, and may have a judgment to form upon
it. It need not be ap∣plied to the present consideration; for had the march
taken place at the time it ought to have done, upon the principle of the
defenders of that scheme, the time that Fraser's corps first past the
river upon the bridge of rafts, waste would only have conspired to
accomplish in <HI>three days</HI> a ruin that with the best husbandry
would have been inevitable in <HI>six:</HI> for the same fall of rain which
it has been shewn in evidence actually carried away the bridge a very few
days after it was constructed, necessarily made the ford of the Mohawk
for an advance, and every ford of the Hudson's River for a return,
impassable. It hardly need be noticed, that a flood must have made any
use of rafts, could they have been timely obtained, equally impracticable.
The army, therefore, would have become victims to famine, without a blow, or a
single effort of the enemy. Saratoga must have been the anticipated scene
of surrender, without other conditions than the mercy of sustenance; the
whole force of Mr. Gates would have been loose to co-operate with Mr.
Washington, with the finest season of the campaign before them; and the
General of the northern army, with∣out a shadow of professional defence,
and precluded from the plea usually so per∣suasive, that he fought hard
before he failed, must have met the censure of his So∣vereign and a
justly offended country, with none to support him but the present
advocates of a rapid march. Could his dependence have been sure even upon
them? Would they not rather have adhered to their opposite and original
system (for strange as it is, the same men have supported both) and
have asserted, that it was extreme rashness to cross the Hudson's
River at all?</P>
<P>If what I have said in objection to the principle and
practicability of a rapid march to Albany, previous to the attempt upon
Bennington, has weight, very little need be added on the subject afterwards,
because every objection will multiply up∣on <PB N="114" REF="120"/> the mind
of the most cursory observer. I shall only call the attention to a very
few essential circumstances. The enemy was in force; a proof of his being
so is, that Mr. Gates quitted his position behind the Mohawk, which was his
strongest, and advanced to Stillwater. The force found at Bennington upon
the march from the Hampshire Grants to the main army, proved the vigour and
ala∣crity of the enemy in that country. The circumstances of the action at
Benning∣ton established a yet more melancholy conviction of the fallacy of
any dependence upon supposed friends. The noble Lord has said, that 
<Q REND="inline">"I never despaired of the campaign before the
affair of Bennington; that I had no doubt of gaining Albany in as short a
time as the army (in due condition of supply) could accomplish the
march."</Q> I acknowledge the truth of the assertions in their fullest
extent; all my letters at the time shew it. I will go further, and in one
sense apply with the noble Lord the epithet "fatal" to the affair of
Bennington. The knowledge I acquired of the professors of loyalty was
"fatal," and put an end to every expectation from enterprize unsustained by
dint of force. It would have been excess of fren∣zy to have trusted for
sustenance to the plentiful region of Albany. Had the march thither been
practicable in all respects, and even unopposed, (which nobody will think
would have been the case) the enemy finding the British army unsupplied,
would only have had to compel the Tories to drive the cattle and destroy the
corn or the corn mills, and the convention of Albany instead of Saratoga
must have fol∣lowed. Would the Tories have risen? Why did they not rise
round Albany and below it, at the time they found Mr. Gates's army increasing
by separate and di∣stinct parties from remote distances? They were better
qualified by their situation to catch the favourable moment than I was to
advise it. Why did they not rise in that populous and as supposed well
affected district, the German Flats, at the time St. Leger was before Fort
Stanwix? A critical insurrection from any one point of the compass within
distance to create diversion, would probably have secured the success
of the campaign.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Col. St. Le∣ger's letter. No. V.</NOTE>But to
revert to the encrease of reasons against a rapid march after the affair
of Bennington. It was then also known, that by the false intelligence
respecting the strength of Fort Stanwix, the infamous behaviour of the
Indians, and the want of the promised co-operation of the loyal inhabitants,
Lieut. Col. St. Leger had been obliged to retreat. The first plausible
motive in favour of hazardous haste, the fa∣cilitating his descent of the
Mohawk, was thus at an end. The prospect of finding the enemy dispersed
it has before been shewn was over.</P>
<P>The impossibility of preserving a communication was also
evident. Was the ar∣my to have proceeded to action without hospital stores,
as well as without victual? The general who carries troops into fire without
precautions to alleviate the certain consequences, takes a sure step to
alienate the affections, and destroy the ardour of <PB N="115" REF="121"/> the
soldier—he exacts more than human spirit can furnish. Men need not
be ha∣bituated to fields of battle to be convinced of this truth. Let the mind
rest for a moment on the objects which will rise within it after the
mention of action, and then reflect, there is not a mattrass for broken
bones, nor a cordial for agony and faint∣ness. They who talk of these rapid
marches, suppose no opposition, or no suffering in consequence of
opposition. The hundreds of wounded men to be cruelly aban∣doned (if the
rest could be prevailed upon to abandon those whose case might the next
day be their own) make no part of the consideration of these gentlemen of
precipitate imaginations. But officers who are responsible to God and their
coun∣try for the armies they conduct, cannot so easily overlook such
objects; and must be patient at least till a few hundred beds, and a proper
proportion of medicine and chirurgical materials, can be brought up for troops
that are to fight as well as to march.</P>
<P>The consideration of rapid movement has run into much length: the
stress laid upon it in the cross-examination, was the cause. I beg
leave very shortly to reca∣pitulate the principal points, and shall then
dismiss it to the public judgment, with∣out great apprehension of having
it renewed even in speculation.</P>
<P>Had a proper store of live cattle been obtained by the expedition
to Bennington, (and by the bye it will be remembered, that had the loyalists
of the country been really of the number and description represented, that
acquisition might have been made without an action) all the carriages might
have been appropriated solely to the conveyance of flour, hospital
accommodations, entrenching tools, and other absolute necessaries; and a
rapid march to Albany might have been hazarded.</P>
<P>After the expedition to Bennington had failed of that great
purpose, had a gar∣rison for Ticonderoga been attainable from Canada, and
the force then at Ticon∣deroga been brought forward, to establish a post
of communication, and secure a passage of the river by a fortified
bridge, and redoubts upon the heights which every where command the river, on
one shore or the other, a forced march might still have been justifiable,
because a retreat was secure: but, divested of both these resources,
a rapid movement must inevitably have led to rapid ruin.</P>
<P>Having gone through all the material points previous to the 13th of
September, and shewn, I trust, by distinct evidence, as well as
reasoning, the expediency of the march from Skenesborough to Fort Edward;
the principle of the expedition to Bennington; the cause of its failure; the
efforts used to bring forwards the provi∣sion and necessary stores,
and the impracticability of proceeding without those stores; 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Review of the measure of passing the

review of the measure of passing the Hudson's River on that day.</P>
<P>I entered pretty fully, in my Narrative, into the principles which

Brigadier Fraser's sen∣timents.</NOTE>has been led to doubt whether I was
required by duty, situation, the voice of the army, and the voice of
reason, to advance and fight, to follow the consideration of those
principles, with a revisal of the applicable part of the verbal evidence, and
I will then venture further to appeal to their judgment, whether, instead of
being required, I was not compelled, by the state of things, to act as I did;
even inde∣pendently of the peremptory tenor of my orders, which, confident in
the strength of my case, I have purposely omitted, upon this occasion,
to reconsider.</P>
<P>In regard to the point so much agitated in this country, though
with no founda∣tion whatever from any thing that happened in America, Brigadier
Fraser's senti∣ments upon this measure of passing the Hudson's
River, it would be trifling with the patience of the reader to recapitulate and
point the evidence to a matter which I do not believe there is a man so
prejudiced as now to dispute, viz. that that officer joined in opinion and
impatience with the rest of the army. But though the false∣hoods so
grossly and so long imposed upon the public, respecting this matter,
are no more, it may not be unworthy curiosity to explore their origin and
trace their progress.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Progress of the false∣hoods
propa∣gated.</NOTE>It is not difficult to discern that the suspicion of
difference of opinion in the army, upon the measure of passing the
Hudson's River, arose from the paragraph in my public letter from Albany to
the Secretary of State, wherein I say that I had called no council upon that
subject, but had acted upon my own judgment of the peremp∣tory tenor of my
orders.</P>
<P>That a man, chief in authority, should take entirely upon
himself a measure of doubtful consequence, and upon mere principle
preclude himself from any future means of shifting or dividing the blame
that might ensue, appeared incredible at Whitehall: the greater part of that
political school concluded the profession of such candour must be a
finesse, and that, in fact, the General had not communicated with his
officers, because he knew opinions would have been against him.</P>
<P>When little minds think they have got a clue of littleness it is
wonderful with what zeal and dexterity they pursue and improve it.
Correspondence and intelligence were not wanting; disappointed jobbers,
discarded servants, dissatisfied fugitives of every sort, spies,
tale-bearers, and sycophants, whom it is to the honour of a Gene∣ral to have
his enemies, and a disgrace to Office to encourage, abounded in town; and the
primary idea once given, it was carried forward by very ready assistance,
and even logical deduction.—As thus:</P>
<P>The General declares in his dispatch, he called no man into
council upon the measure of passing the Hudson's River:
<HI>Therefore,</HI> his officers differed in opinion upon the expediency of
advancing.</P>
<P>To differ in opinion upon that expediency, they must construe
his orders not to be peremptory: <HI>Therefore,</HI> he stands single in
the interpretation he put upon his orders.</P>
<P><PB N="117" REF="123"/> If his officers saw that he was
unadvisedly and desparately leading his army to death, they would certainly
remonstrate: <HI>Therefore,</HI> they remonstrated.</P>
<P>The remonstrance would naturally be made to him by superior
officers: <HI>Therefore,</HI> the conclusion follows; Major General Phillips
and Brigadier General Fraser actu∣ally made a remonstrance against
passing the Hudson's River.</P>
<P>General Reidesel, who was next in rank to General Phillips,
seems to have been forgotten. He was probably overlooked in the eagerness
to get at General Fraser, on whose name the important stress was laid,
and for two palpable reasons; the one, that his name stood high in the
public estimation, and greatly as it deserved so to stand, perhaps it
acquired, upon this intended use, more justice from some quarters than it
would otherwise have received.</P>
<P>The second and more prevalent reason was, that Brigadier General
Fraser was dead.</P>
<P>Thus then stood the assertion when I arrived in England: 
<Q REND="inline">"<HI>Major General Phillips and Brigadier General
Fraser remonstrated against passing the Hudson's River, which
movement was the cause of all the subsequent misfortunes.</HI>"</Q> And
having traced this falsehood to its maturity, it now may be equally curious
to follow its decline.</P>
<P>After my arrival in England, the friendship, and general
conformity of sentiment between General Phillips and me became more known. He
was alive, and might possibly soon return. His name was therefore
withdrawn from the remonstrance, and reserved, in case he did not return,
to give colour to a second falsehood,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">That General
Phillips offered to conduct a part of the army from Saratoga to Ticonderoga.
See this falsehood refuted, in the evidence of Lord Balcarras, Col.
Kingston, &amp;c.</NOTE> then kept back, but since produced as one of the
last efforts of malignity in the course of the late enquiry.</P>
<P>The first public occasion that offered was seized by me to
pledge my honour upon the whole story of disagreement of opinion being
false; and I dared any man to produce a letter or a sentence, from
Brigadier Fraser or any other officer, to authorise a suspicion of its
being true. Lieutenant General Fraser, upon the same occasion in the
House of Commons, voluntarily and generously entered into my
justification, upon the authority of his correspondence with his late
relation, and the knowledge of his general sentiments.</P>
<P>The falsehood was immediately so far weakened, that the word
<HI>Remonstrance</HI> was changed into <HI>Opinion.</HI> 
<Q REND="inline">"<HI>Brigadier Fraser's opinion was against
passing the Hudson's River;</HI>"</Q> and thus it remained, now and then
assisted and cherished, when it was very languid, by a whisper, 
<Q REND="inline">"<HI>that there were still letters to be
produced,</HI>"</Q> till the late enquiry took place; and the evidence of Lord
Balcarras, Lord Harrington, <PB N="118" REF="124"/> Colonel Kingston, &amp;c.
gave the death blow to the last struggling efforts of that calumny. The
rashness of passing the Hudson's River was obliterated; every
com∣ment upon that <HI>fatal</HI> step was suddenly dropt, as if the river
had sunk under ground; the charge, with the full accompaniment of General
Fraser's disapprobation, re∣monstrance, &amp;c. &amp;c. was shifted;
the minister was as nimble as his confederates, and exclaimed upon the
<HI>fatality</HI> of the expedition to Bennington.</P>
<P>And here I shall finally rest the support I have been so
anxious to derive from that grave which has been ransacked by my
adversaries for evidence against me. As a soldier I avow a pride in
having possessed Brigadier Fraser's esteem. As a de∣fendant I am
sensible I have dwelt upon it to a fault. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The com∣ments of an inferior offi∣cer no pro∣per

cha∣racter. His approbation gave a grace to my defence, and I was impatient to
confute the calumny that would have robbed me of it; but to admit that it was
necessary for my acquittal would be to countenance and forward the most
pernicious and pre∣posterous doctrine that ever was practised to mislead
the public, and to betray the service.</P>
<P>When a minister or his confederates lean upon private report,
table talk, and half sentences, to depreciate an officer they dare not
themselves accuse, it is a feebleness of vengeance that, in its first
aspect, is contemptible in the extreme; but it calls for our indignation when
we extend our view to its principle and effects. They operate to the very
inversion of due patronage, and the absolute extinction of every idea upon
which command ought to be bestowed, or can efficaciously be exer∣cised;
they tend to encourage officers to be spies and informers; to render camps
and fleets, properly the residence of harmony and honour, the seats of
suspicion, discord, faction, treachery, and mutiny.</P>
<P>The diversity and importance of the matter brought to review in
the period of the campaign I am now closing, has led to greater length than I
was aware of; but I cannot dismiss it without one reference, addressed
to such of the examiners of my conduct as have insisted upon the
tardiness of the northern army.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Comparative view of the campaigns in 1759 and
1777.</NOTE>The reference I would plead is to a campaign in the same country,
memorable for having been conducted by an officer whose example must be
acknowledged, at this juncture, to be of splendid and peculiar authority; I
mean the campaign of Lord Amherst, in the year 1759.</P>
<P>The great points of the war in America that year were to divide the
enemy's force, and at the same time to direct the several operations with
such concurrence, that, though separate and remote, they should
assist each other. The first objects of the <PB N="119" REF="125"/> army
to which I allude were to reduce Ticonderoga and Crown Point, and the ulti∣mate
and most important one was to effect a junction with Mr. Wolfe before
Quebec.</P>
<P>Thus far there is great similarity between the plans of the two
campaigns, except that the points from which the armies marched, and to which
they were destined, were exactly reversed.</P>
<P>In the Spring, 1759, the army, then assembled at Albany, took
the field as early as the season would admit: but such were the natural
impediments of the country, that though supported by the unanimous zeal of
the inhabitants, and furnished with abundant supplies of draft cattle,
carriages, water-craft, and every other necessary; the several
departments well directed, and no enemy to oppose the march, the Ge∣neral
(Lord Amherst) was not able to commence the attack of Ticonderoga till the
7th of July, when the enemy abandoned that post, and retreated to Crown
Point.</P>
<P>The distance from Albany to Fort George is between sixty and
seventy miles, the passage over Lake George to Ticonderoga about forty
miles.</P>
<P>The General had reason to believe that Crown Point would be given
up at his approach as precipitately as Ticonderoga had been. He did not,
however, reach it, a distance of thirteen miles, and water-carriage at will,
till the 14th of August.</P>
<P>Was it at that time asked by the minister or his adherents, what
was the army doing not to pursue a flying enemy?—Not to pursue when
the whole country behind was their own, and magazines, baggage, hospitals,
and every other necessary, might follow at leisure, and in security!
When it was foreseen an encrease of fleet was to be constructed at Crown
Point, to obtain the superiority over the enemy upon Lake Champlain, and
consequently that every day's delay, in becoming master of that post,
risked the campaign!</P>
<P>Although these enquiries were not then suggested to the
public, an answer to them has been given, greatly to the honour of the
General, in a very impartial hi∣story of that time. 
<Q REND="inline">"The army was employed in repairing the
fortifications at Ticonderoga; and the General took his measures with the
same care as if he ex∣pected an obstinate defence, and attempt to
surprise him on his march."</Q></P>
<P>The enemy actually did abandon Crown Point on the approach of the
General, the 14th of August; and, as soon as in possession of that
post, he set about fortify∣ing it as he had done Ticonderoga. The time
consumed in that operation, and in building new vessels, brought it to
the middle of October before the General could embark upon the Lake. A
suspence, undoubtedly, of great anxiety; for the great end of the campaign,
the junction of the two armies, upon which the reduc∣tion of all Canada was
thought to depend, was unattained.</P>
<P>But did the minister or his adherents <HI>then</HI> cavil at the
tardiness of that army?—Enterprising, sanguine, and impetuous, as
was the character of that minister's <PB N="120" REF="126"/> councils, there
was not less energy in his protection. The nation, not a party, were his
adherents; and his word was a <HI>fiat</HI> of fame. He bestowed emphatic
praises on his General; and a failing campaign became part of that basis,
from which he has ascended to the high honours he now deservedly
possesses.</P>
<P>It would be great presumption, and it is far from being intended,
to draw any parallels or inferences from the campaigns of 1759 and 1777, except
such as merely apply to consumption of time under similar
circumstances. In other points the pretensions of the respective Generals
may be as different as their fortunes; or, to make a much clearer
distinction, and a yet stronger contrast, as wide asunder as the
auspices under which they served, those of Mr. Pitt and of Lord George
Germain.</P>

the total defection of the Indians, and the deser∣tion or timidity of the
Canadians and Provincials, some individuals excepted; disappointed in the

reduced, by losses from the best parts, to 3500 fighting men, not 2000 of
which were British; only three days provisions, upon short allowance, in

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Appenix, No. XIV.</NOTE>Such was the summary of
affairs given in my letter from Albany to the secretary of state. At the
time it was written, I little expected to have occasion for any other
testimony of my actions; and it has therefore been supposed, that I gave
them a colouring more specious than exact. This is the stage of my defence
in which I am desirous to bring that matter to judgment; and I have quoted
the above pas∣sage, expressly to lead the attention of every examiner to
the whole of that letter. Let it now be considered, unitedly with my late
narrative, and both be compared in detail with the evidence—I am bold to
stake my cause upon the issue—And rest∣ing upon these
references, my comments upon this period, though it is the most im∣portant,
will be shorter than upon either of the former: the proofs also are more
collected, and the matters controverted or started in cross-examination are
fewer.</P>
<P>The first remark I have to make is, that while the managers of the
minister's cause have never admitted a doubt of the reality of those
movements in the cam∣paign, with the propriety of which their ingenuity
promised them even a coloura∣ble cause of cavil, they have had the
address, when any little skill and conduct were generally acknowledged, to
call the existence of such movements into question. I cannot make this
remark more pertinently than at present, when the march of the 
<PB N="121" REF="127"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">March to the enemy on the 19th of Sept. Plan

place the object of notice— 
<Q REND="inline">"A pretty combination of columns and deployments
composed at Al∣bany, and very fit for a Gazette."</Q> This sort of language
I believe most persons have heard, who have conversed with the dependents
or runners of office, and it will be my excuse for submitting to the
judgment of my profession a plan of the movement. It will shew in some
degree the difficulties that the nature of the coun∣try opposed to a combined
march of columns; and at the same time the disadvan∣tage (I might say the
certain defeat) that must have been sustained, had the army been only in
one column upon the ground where it was attacked, or had the com∣bination of
the other columns, those of General Fraser in particular, been less exact
to the point of time in which it was expedient they should arrive and
form.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Lord Balcar∣ras, quest. 33, 34. Maj. Forbes,
quest. 3 to 7. Lord Har∣rington's quest. 38 to 42 inclusive.</NOTE>To
prove that this march was not <HI>composed</HI> at Albany, I refer to
several witnesses, but particularly to the Earl of Harrington. His
situation, as my aid-de-camp, gave him a general knowledge of a movement,
that an officer employed in the execu∣tion of a single part of it could not
have acquired. It will be considered by all who know the qualities of my
noble friend, as very honourable to the dispositions of that day, that they
are so circumstantially retained in so distinguishing a mind; and for
my own part, I cannot commit them to military judgment under a better trust
than the accuracy of his description.</P>
<P>I shall not therefore detain the reader an instant longer from a
subject so worthy his attention, as the evidence respecting the behaviour
of the troops in the ensuing events of that day.</P>

67.</NOTE>Few actions have been characterized by more obstinacy in attack or
defence. The British bayonet was repeatedly tried ineffectually. Eleven
hundred British soldiers, foiled in these trials, bore incessant fire
from a succession of fresh troops in superior numbers, for above four
hours; and after a loss of above a third of their numbers (and in one of the
regiments above two thirds) forced the enemy at last. Of a de∣tachment of a
captain and forty-eight artillery men, the captain and thirty-six were killed
or wounded. These facts are marked by a concurrence of evidence that no man
will dispute. The tribute of praise due to such troops will not be
want∣ing in this generous nation; and it will as certainly be accompanied with
a just por∣tion of shame to those who have dared to depreciate or fully
valour so conspicuous—who have their ears open only to the prejudice
of American cowardice; and having been always loud upon that courtly topic,
stifle the glory of their countrymen to maintain a base
consistency.</P>
<P>It will be observable from the accounts of the killed and wounded,
that the loss of officers in all the actions of the campaign was
proportionably much greater than that of the private men: and as this
observation applies particularly to the action we are considering, it may
not be improper to account for it in this place.</P>
<P><PB N="122" REF="128"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reason of the dispropor∣tion of killed and
wound∣ed.</NOTE>The enemy had with their army great numbers of marksmen,
armed with rifle∣barrel pieces: these, during an engagement, hovered upon the
flanks in small de∣tachments, and were very expert in securing
themselves, and in shifting their ground. In this action, many placed
themselves in high trees in the rear of their own line, and there was
seldom a minute's interval of smoke in any part of our line without
officers being taken off by single shot.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Capt.
Green, aid de camp to Major General Phillips, was shot through the arm by one
of these marksmen as he was delivering me a message. I learned, after
the convention, from the command∣ing officer of the riflemen, that the shot
was meant for me; and as the captain was seen to fall from his horse, it
was for some hours believed in the enemy's army that I was killed. My
escape was owing to the captain happening to have a laced furniture to his
saddle, which made him mistaken for the general.</NOTE></P>
<P>It will naturally be supposed, that the Indians would be of
great use against this mode of fighting. The example of those that
remained after the great deser∣tion proved the contrary, for not a man of
them was to be brought within the sound of a rifle shot. The Canadians were
formerly very expert in service of this nature; but besides the change in
their military character, which I noticed before, their best officer was
killed early in the action, which event cast a general damp upon the corps. A
few of the Provincials were serviceable: but the best men I had to oppose
as marksmen, were the German chasseurs, though their number was so
small, as not to be one to twenty of the enemy.</P>

cross-examination upon the proceedings of the army after this action will
shew the folly there would be in bringing a military cause to a
parliamentary enqui∣ry, upon the presumption that any parts of it would be
left unexamined. The very want of practical knowledge in the enquirers renders
them more inquisitive, and much more tenacious of doubts and surmises,
than they would otherwise be: for in∣stance; I do not believe that with an
army exhausted by a long and severe action, and deprived of an uncommon
portion of officers, the question of attacking the enemy next morning would
have occurred to any man of professional judgment: that enemy too in a
position of which no further knowledge could be obtained than that it was
covered by an intrenchment and abattis, and the approach to be made through a
thick wood, without any avenue cut, or a single post fortified to secure
a retreat, or to cover the magazine, which afforded the only possible means
of sub∣sistence.</P>
<P>Equally remote would be the thoughts of military men from attacking
a few days after, when it appeared I had received a letter from Sir Henry
Clinton, informing me of a diversion so powerful as an attack upon Fort
Montgomery to be undertaken as at that very time.</P>
<P>The questions relating to the enemy having their baggage packed,
if that circum∣stance was meant as an indication that they meant to retreat,
is another proof how <PB N="123" REF="129"/> little the questioners knew of
service. It does not appear in evidence how the fact was: but no officer will
dispute, that if the enemy had not only packed their bag∣gage, but actually
conveyed it to the other side the river, they would have acted conformably to
the general practice of service when action is expected; and to no
circumstance of service more than to that when it is resolved to
dispute a post to the last extremity.</P>
<P>Upon the whole of my situation at that time, I am so confident
that it was the part of an officer to fortify and wait events, that I am only
further intent to prove that I fortified properly, the nature of the ground and
my several purposes consi∣dered. Upon this principle I submit the plan
annexed.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plan No. V.</NOTE> It will also shew the na¦ture
of the ground between the two armies, and serve to explain the difficulties
the witnesses express of taking a view of the enemy's left: but it will
be considered, that besides these apparent obstacles to a near
approach, the enemy abounded in militia, which supplied out-posts and
scouts, that could by no means be driven in without making the army liable to
a general action.</P>
<P>As for any other intelligence than what could be obtained by
eye-sight it was generally contradictory, always imperfect; the deserters
were often suspicious, the prisoners very few. I never saw any
instance of service where it was so difficult to obtain information.
Among people speaking the same language with ourselves, and many of them
professing the most favourable dispositions, scarcely any could be
pre∣vailed upon, by rewards or principle, to risk his person for the
purpose of intelligence.</P>
<P>In regard to the cross-examination, respecting the time
necessary for the con∣struction of the redoubts and other works, I
neither thought it worth while to con∣test it at the time, nor shall I
contest it now, though nothing would be more easy than to shew that there
was a great deal of necessary labour which the questions did not lead to,
and consequently the witnesses could not with propriety enter into the
explanation of them. But what makes the consumption of time to me imma∣terial
is, that I place my justification upon the expediency of waiting the
co-opera∣tion from Sir Henry Clinton. It is in proof, that I received a letter
from him the day after the action of the 19th,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The
original letter is in my possession, but could not be produced without
discovering a secret mode of conveying intelligence that it might be
improper to make public.</NOTE> informing me that he meditated an attack upon
Fort Montgomery as at that very time. And as I have already said, that I
should have thought it the part of madness to have risked an attack upon
the enemy, in the weak state of my army, for some time after the late
action, and under the expectation of so powerful a diversion; so should
I have deferred it longer, even after being recruit∣ed from the hospital, on
account of the same expectation, and the further chance of the reinforcement
of Colonel St. Leger's corps, and perhaps a convoy of provi∣sions 
<PB N="124" REF="130"/> from Ticonderoga: so far am I from conceiving the
past delay blameable, that I acknowledge the measure of the 7th of October
was precipitated by some days, by the forage being become so scarce, that
a supply could only be obtained by a move∣ment of the army.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Alert situa∣tion of the army from 20th Sept. to
7th Oct.</NOTE>If any persons have supposed, that what has been called
the inactive state of the army at this period was a state of rest, they
are as much mistaken as they would be if they supposed it in any other
circumstance comfortable. From the 20th of September to the 7th of October,
the armies were so near, that not a night passed without firing, and
sometimes concerted attacks upon our advanced picquets; no foraging party
could be made without great detachments to cover it; it was the plan of the
enemy to harrass the army by constant alarms, and their superiority of
numbers enabled them to attempt it without fatigue to themselves.</P>
<P>By being habituated to fire, our soldiers became indifferent to
it, and were capable of eating or sleeping when it was very near them: but I
do not believe either officer or soldier ever slept during that interval
without his cloaths, or that any general officer, or commander of a regiment,
passed a single night without being upon his legs occasionally at
different hours, and constantly an hour before day-light.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Lord Balcar∣ras, 46, &amp;c. Lord Har∣rington,
57, &amp;c. Lieut. Col. Kingston, 77, &amp;c. Capt. Mo∣ney, 35 to
48</NOTE><NOTE PLACE="marg">See also Plan V.</NOTE>The circumstances in
general of the action of the 7th of October stand in that ar∣ragement in the
evidence of the Earl of Balcarras, Earl of Harrington, Lieut. Col. Kingston,
and Captain Money, and have been so little controverted by
cross∣examination, that any length of comment upon them is unnecessary. I
will only observe, that the movement of the enemy under General Arnold,
mentioned in my Narrative, is confirmed as far as circumstantial testimony
can confirm it, by Captain Money. And if there can be any persons, who, after
considering that circumstance, and the positive proof of the
subsequent obstinacy, in the attack upon the post of Lord Balcarras,
and various other actions of that day, continue to doubt, that the Americans
possess the <HI>quality</HI> and <HI>faculty</HI> of fighting (call it by
whatever term they please) they are of a prejudice that it would be very
absurd longer to contend with.</P>
<P>But though comments upon this part of the evidence may be spared,
the remem∣brance of what I personally underwent cannot so easily be
suppressed; and I am sure I shall not outgo the indulgence of the
candid, if in delineating situations so affect∣ing, I add feelings to
justification. The defence of military conduct is an interesting point of
professional honour; but to vindicate the heart, is a duty to God and to
society at large.</P>
<P>Few conjunctures in the campaign I nave been describing, few,
perhaps, upon military record, can be found so distinguished by
exigencies, or productive of such critical and anxious calls upon public
character, and private affection, as that which now took place.</P>
<P><PB N="125" REF="131"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lord Balcar∣ras, 5<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE>In the first place, the position of the army was
untenable, and yet an immediate retreat was impossible; not only from the
fatigue of the troops, but from the necessity of delivering fresh
ammunition and provisions.</P>
<P>The losses in the action were uncommonly severe. Sir Francis
Clarke, my aid-de∣camp, had originally recommended himself to my attention by
his talents and dili∣gence: as service and intimacy opened his character
more, he became endeared to me by every quality that can create esteem. I
lost in him an useful assistant, an amia∣ble companion, an attached
ftiend: the state was deprived by his death, of one of the fairest
promises of an able general.</P>
<P>The fate of Colonel Ackland, taken prisoner, and then supposed
to be mortally wounded, was a second source of anxiety—General
Fraser was expiring.</P>
<P>In the course of the action, a shot had passed through my
hat, and another had torn my waistcoat. I should be sorry to be thought
at any time insensible to the protect∣ing hand of Providence; but I ever
more particularly considered (and I hope not superstitiously) a
soldier's hair-breadth escapes as incentives to duty, <HI>a marked renewal
of the trust of Being,</HI> for the due purposes of a public station; and
under that reflection to lose our fortitude, by giving way to our affections;
to be diverted by any possible self-emotion from meeting a present
exigency with our best faculties, were at once dishonour and impiety.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Lord Balcar∣ras, 53. Lord Har∣rington, 66. Plan,
No. VI. State of things on the 8th.</NOTE>Having therefore put aside for a
time my private sensations, it has been shewn that I effected an entire
change in the position of the army before day-light. The plan will shew the
new ground taken up. Early in the morning of the 8th, General Fraser breathed
his last—and with the kindest expressions of his affection, his
last request was brought me, that he might be carried without parade by the
soldiers of his corps to the great redoubt, and buried there. The whole day
of the 8th of October was cor∣respondent to this inauspicious beginning.
The hours were measured by a succession of immediate cares,
encreasing doubts, and melancholy objects. The enemy were formed in two
lines. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lord Har∣rington, 67, &amp;c.</NOTE>Every part of
their disposition, as well as the repeated attacks upon Lord Balcarras's
corps, and the cannonade from the plain, kept the troops in momentary
expectation of a general action. During this suspense, wounded officers,
some upon crutches, and others even carried upon hand-barrows by their
servants, were occasionally ascending the hill from the hospital tents,
to take their share in the action, or follow the march of the army. The
generals were employed in exhorting the troops.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. Fraser's funeral.</NOTE>About sun-set
the corpse of General Fraser was brought up the hill, attended only by the
officers who had lived in his family. To arrive at the redoubt, it passed
with∣in view of the greatest part of both armies. General Phillips, General
Reidesel, and myself, who were standing together, were struck with the
humility of the procession: <PB N="126" REF="132"/> They who were ignorant
that privacy had been requested, might construe it neglect. We could
neither endure that reflection, nor indeed restrain our natural propensity
to pay our last attention to his remains. The circumstances that ensued
cannot be better described than they have been by different
witnesses.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Particularly Lieutenant Colonel
Kingston, 85.</NOTE> The incessant cannonade during the solemnity; the
steady attitude and unaltered voice with which the chap∣lain officiated,
though frequently covered with dust, which the shot threw up on all sides
of him; the mute but expressive mixture of sensibility and indignation
upon every countenance: these objects will remain to the last of life upon
the minds of every man who was present. The growing duskiness added to
the scenery, and the whole marked a character of that juncture that would
make one of the finest subjects for the pencil of a master that the field
ever exhibited—To the canvas and to the faithful page of a more important
historian, gallant friend! I consign thy memory. There may thy talents, thy
manly virtues, their progress and their period, find due distinction; and
long may they survive;—long after the frail record of my pen shall be
forgotten.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Night march of the 8th.</NOTE>The reflections
arising from these scenes gave place to the perplexities of the night. A
defeated army was to retreat from an enemy flushed with success, much
superior in front, and occupying strong posts in the country behind. We
were equally liable upon that march to be attacked in front, in flank, or rear.
The dis∣position of march had been concerted as much as circumstances
would admit; and it was executed by the officers and the troops in general with
a precision that expe∣rience in critical situations can only teach. The
baggage, which could only move in one column, and in a narrow road, fell into
the confusion which it is impossible for caution to guard against in
the dark, because a single accident of an overturn or a broken wheel, or
even the stupidity or drunkenness of a driver, may stop and often
confuse the motion of the whole line. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lord Har∣rington, 70, and from 112 to
118.</NOTE>Care was taken that no such accident should break the order of
the troops, and orders were sent to Major General Phillips, who commanded the
rear guard, in case he was attacked, to pay attention only to the main object
of covering the troops; or, if occasion were, of taking a position to give
them time to form.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Continuance of the march on the 9th.</NOTE>At
day-break the next morning the army had reached very advantageous ground, and
took a position in which it would have been very desirable to receive the
enemy. A halt was necessary to refresh the troops, and to give time to
the bateaux, loaded with provisions, which had not been able to keep pace
with the troops, to come a-breast. A portion of provisions was delivered
also from the bateaux, not without apprehension that that delivery might be
the last: for there were parts of the river in which the boats might be
attacked from the other side to great advantage, notwith∣standing the
correspondent movement of the army.</P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="133"/> The above purposes being effected, the army
proceeded in very severe weather, and through exceeding bad roads.</P>
<P>Besides the continuation of difficulties and general fatigue, this
day was remark∣able for a circumstance of private distress too peculiar
and affecting to be omitted. The circumstance to which I allude is Lady
Harriet Ackland's passage through the enemy's army, to attend her wounded
husband, then their prisoner.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Extraordi∣nary occur∣rence of pri∣vate
distress.</NOTE>The progress of this lady with the army could hardly be
thought abruptly or su∣perfluously introduced, were it only so for the
purpose of authenticating a wonderful story.—It would exhibit, if
well delineated, an interesting picture of the spirit, the enterprize, and
the distress of romance, realized and regulated upon the chaste and
sober principles of rational love and connubial duty.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Lieut. Col. Kingston, 131 to 133.</NOTE>But I
beg leave to observe besides, that it has direct reference to my subject,
to shew what the luxuries were with which (as the world has been taught to
believe) the army was encumbered; what were the accommodations prepared for the
<HI>two thousand women</HI> that are gravely supposed, in the cross
examination, to have fol∣lowed with the baggage. An idea so preposterous,
as well as false, would have been a fitter subject for derision than
refutation, but that it was maliciously intended; not, I am confident, by the
member who asked the questions, but by the persons who imposed upon
him, to effect by prejudice what they despaired of effecting by
fact.—Not content with cavilling at our pretensions of having
<HI>fought</HI> hard, they would not allow the army even the claim upon the
good-nature of the nation, of having <HI>fared</HI> hard for its service.</P>
<P>I shall however consider part of this story as so far
unconnected with the immediate business I was upon (pursuing the line of
evidence upon the retreat to Saratoga) as to give it in the margin. It may well
stand by itself; and I venture to think that this one example of patience,
suffering, and fortitude, will be permitted to pass without censure or
obloquy.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"> 
<P>Lady Harriet Ackland had accompanied her husband to Canada in
the beginning of the year 1776. In the course of that campaign she had
traversed a vast space of country, in different extremities of
season, and with difficulties that an European traveller will not easily
conceive, to attend, in a poor hut at Chamblée, upon his sick bed.</P>

<P>In the opening of the campaign of 1777 she was restrained
from offering herself to a share of the fatigue and hazard expected before
Ticonderoga, by the positive injunctions of her husband. The day after the
conquest of that place, he was badly wounded, and she crossed the Lake
Champlain to join him.</P> 
<P>As soon as he recovered, Lady Harriet proceeded to follow his
fortunes through the campaign, and at Fort Edward, or at the next camp, she
acquired a two-wheel tumbril, which had been con∣structed by the artificers
of the artillery, something similar to the carriage used for the mail
upon the great roads of England. Major Ackland commanded the British
grenadiers, which were attached to General Fraser's corps; and consequently
were always the most advanced post of the army. Their situations were
often so alert, that no person slept out of their cloaths. In one of
these situations a tent, in which the major and Lady Harriet were asleep,
suddenly took fire. An orderly serjeant of grenadiers, with great hazard of
suffocation, dragged out the first person he caught hold of. It proved to
be the major. It happened, that in the same instant she had, unknowing
what she did, and perhaps not perfectly awake, providentially made her
escape, by creeping under the walls of the back part of the tent. The first
object she saw, upon the recovery of her senses, was the major on the
other side, and in the same instant again in the fire, in search of
her. The serjeant again saved him, but not without the major being very
severely burned in his face and different parts of the body. Every thing they
had with them in the tent was consumed.</P> 
<P>This accident happened a little time before the army passed
the Hudson's River. It neither altered the resolution nor the
chearfulness of Lady Harriet; and she continued her progress, a partaker
of the fatigues of the advanced corps. The next call upon her fortitude was of
a different nature, and more distressful, as of longer suspense. On
the march of the 19th, the grenadiers being liable to action at every step,
she had been directed by the major to follow the route of the artillery and
bag∣gage, which was not exposed. At the time the action began she found
herself near a small uninha∣bited hut, where she alighted. When it was
found the action was becoming general and bloody, the surgeons of the
hospital took possession of the same place, as the most
convenient for the first care of the wounded. Thus was this lady in hearing
of one continued fire of cannon and musketry, for four hours together, with
the presumption, from the post of her husband at the head of the
grena∣diers, that he was in the most exposed part of the action. She had
three female companions, the Baroness of Reidesel and the wives of two
British officers, Major Harnage and Lieutenant Reynell; but in the event
their presence served but little for comfort. Major Harnage was soon
brought to the surgeons, very badly wounded; and a little time after came
intelligence that Lieutenant Reynell was shot dead. Imagination will want no
helps to figure the state of the whole groupe.</P> 
<P>From the date of that action to the 7th of October, Lady
Harriet, with her usual serenity, stood prepared for new trials! and it
was her lot that their severity encreased with their numbers. She was again
exposed to the hearing of the whole action, and at last received the
shock of her individual misfortune, mixed with the intelligence of the
general calamity, the troops were defeated, and Major Ackland, desperately
wounded, was a prisoner.</P> 
<P>The day of the 8th was passed by Lady Harriet and her
companions in common anxiety, not a tent, nor a shed being standing, except
what belonged to the Hospital, their refuge was among the wounded and the
dying.</P></NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="128" REF="134"/> When the army was upon the point of moving
after the halt described, I re∣ceived a message from Lady Harriet,
submitting to my decision a proposal (and expressing an earnest
solicitude to execute it, if not interfering with my designs) of
passing to the camp of the enemy, and requesting General Gates's
permission to attend her husband.</P>
<P>Though I was ready to believe (for I had experienced) that patience
and for∣titude, in a supreme degree, were to be found, as well as every other
virtue, under the most tender forms, I was astonished at this proposal.
After so long an agitation of the spirits, exhausted not only for want of
rest, but absolutely want of food, drenched in rains for twelve hours
together, that a woman should be capable of such an undertaking as
delivering herself to the enemy, probably in the night, and uncertain of what
hands she might first fall into, appeared an effort above human nature. The
assistance I was enabled to give was small indeed; I had not even a cup
of wine to offer her; but I was told she had found, from some kind and
fortunate hand, a little rum and dirty water. All I could furnish to her was
an open boat and a few lines, written upon dirty and wet paper, to General
Gates, recommending her to his protection.</P>
<P><PB N="129" REF="135"/> Mr. Brudenell, the chaplain to the artillery
(the same gentleman who had offi∣ciated so signally at General Fraser's
funeral) readily undertook to accompany her, and with one female servant, and
the major's valet-de-chambre (who had a ball which he had received in the late
action then in his shoulder) she rowed down the river to meet the enemy.
But her distresses were not yet to end. The night was advanced before the
boat reached the enemy's out-posts, and the centinel would not let it pass,
nor even come on shore. In vain Mr. Brudenell offered the flag of truce, and
represented the state of the extraordinary passenger. The guard,
apprehensive of treachery, and punctilious to their orders, threatened to
fire into the boat if it stirred before day light. Her anxiety and
suffering were thus protracted through se∣ven or eight dark and cold hours;
and her reflections upon that first reception could not give her very
encouraging ideas of the treatment she was afterwards to expect. But it is
due to justice at the close of this adventure to say, that she was
received and accommodated by General Gates with all the humanity and respect
that her rank, her merits and her fortunes deserved.</P>
<P>Let such as are affected by these circumstances of alarm,
hardship and danger, recollect, that the subject of them was a woman; of
the most tender and delicate frame; of the gentlest manners; habituated to
all the soft elegancies, and refined enjoyments, that attend high birth and
fortune; and far advanced in a state in which the tender cares, always due to
the sex, become indispensibly necessary. Her mind alone was formed
for such trials.</P>

the Fish-Kill in different columns, and to make their great effort upon the
plain, they must have formed under the fire of all our park artillery, within
reach of grape-shot, a cross fire from the artillery and musketry of the
intrenched corps upon the hill, and the musketry of the 20th regiment, which
was at easy distance to be supported by the Germans, in front; added to
this would have been the advantage, which though always wished for we never
had attained, of a charge upon an open plain. I am persuaded the general
judgment will go with me when I lament the accident that prevented the enemy's
design (when so far advanced in it, as actually to have passed the
river with one column) as one of the most adverse strokes of fortune in
the whole campaign.</P>

For a proof that such was their opinion, I refer to the testimony of Lord
Balcarras.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Reflections upon the convention.</NOTE>A fair
judgment upon recent events is hardly to be expected, especially while many
prejudices are alive. It will be allowed me to assume, what no one has ever
ventured to deny, that there may be a combination of circumstances under
which an army may be justified in treating with an enemy. That the army under
my com∣mand was under such circumstances at Saratoga is also generally
acknowledged: but what is not denied to me from my own situation, is
attempted to be withheld, by some, on account of the quality of the enemy.
They suggest that there should be no treaty with rebels. It is
unnecessary in answer to have recourse to history. I will not take
defence from treaties between Spain, the haughtiest power of the world, and
the arch-rebel the great Prince of Orange; nor between Charles the First and
the arch-rebels the English Parliament (for such in both instances they
were called) I need only refer to the examples existing at that time in
America, <PB N="132" REF="138"/> and since much improved on at home. My
superior officer in America, with the approbation of government, had treated
upon different occasions with General Washington. The British government
in its highest collective authority, the King in Parliament, has since
commissioned five members of that Parliament, the one a peer, the others of
eminent station in military and civil capacities, to <HI>treat with</HI>
rebels, I had almost said to <HI>sue</HI> to rebels for peace, by the
surrender of almost every principle for the maintenance of which they had
prosecuted the war.</P>
<P>Thus highly justified in treating with rebels, I am at a loss to
discover by what possible mode of defence I could have acquitted myself
to God or my country, when the brave and intelligent officers of my army
unanimously resolved, upon military principle, precedent and reason, that
the treaty was expedient, and the terms honourable, if I had delivered them up
to certain destruction, or even to be prisoners at discretion.</P>
<P>If the informed and dispassionate part of mankind should
agree in sentiment with the unanimous voice of the army, upon the convention
of Saratoga, surely to impute to it the final loss of the army is too
palpable an injustice long to remain upon the minds of the most prejudiced.
The convention expressly preserved the army for the service of the
state. According to that convention a truce was made during the war, between
that army and the enemy, in America, and it now might have been acting
against the House of Bourbon in any other part of the world. The army was
lost by the non-compliance with the treaty on the part of the Congress; and
that violation of faith no man will ever be found to justify.</P>
<P>I will not decide how far it was encouraged in America, by the
persuasion that the ministry of Britain had neither power nor spirit to
redress the wrong; and that they had sunk the nation so low, in point of
respect, that the world would over∣look, where she was concerned, an action
that would have excited, in any other case, universal censure and
indignation. But whatever motives the Congress may have had, the tameness
and silence with which the British ministers have borne this outrage, is
astonishing. That men so constant and so prodigal in their anger
against the Congress, as never before to have failed in expressing it,
even in cases where it bordered upon being ridiculous, should on a sudden
become cold and mute, and dead to feeling, in a case where resentment was
justly founded, can hardly be accounted for, except upon the principle that
it was better to suppress the justest censure upon a power they
detested, than that even a particle of unme∣rited odium should be wanting
to load the man whom they were resolved to depress.</P>

<HEAD>CONCLUSION.</HEAD>
<P>I AM not aware that in the preceding Review of Evidence I have
neglected any part essential to my defence. I do not reckon as such, that
part which applies to the management of the public purse. The calumny
designed to wound me upon that head was too gross to succeed: it
perished in its birth, and scorn is the only sentiment excited by the
remembrance of its momentary existence. In regard to the more plausible
objections pointed against my conduct, I have not only endea∣voured to meet
them in the cross-examination, but have searched for them in every place
where I could suppose them to originate or be entertained. If some have
escaped, I shall stand excused, when it is recollected how they have
grown and changed from one shape to another, and that it has never been my
fortune to be confronted with an avowed and regular accuser—I despair
of ever being so: but I desire it to be understood, that although I am
earnest in this mode of defence, I am so far from declining another, that I
shall think it one very happy circumstance of the past enquiry, if any
thing contained in it should have effect hereafter to pro∣duce an enquiry by
court-martial.</P>
<P>It would not be an ungrateful task to follow the defence of the
campaign with a detail of the occurrences which happened between the time of
signing the conven∣tion and my leaving America. Many of them would be found
curious; and the cares and perplexities in which I bore a principal and most
painful part, would create a new interest in the minds of my friends: but I
do not think myself at liberty, upon the plan I laid down at my outset, to
enter into matter where no blame is imputed or implied. If my proceedings
during that interval deserve any credit, I am content with that testimony
of it, which I may assume from the silence of my enemies.</P>
<P>I have not the same reasons for passing over the
transactions in which I have been engaged since my return to England,
because blame, and of a very atrocious na∣ture, <HI>has</HI> been imputed to
me. But as the principal of these transactions are already before the
public, I shall mention them very briefly; and merely to introduce
con∣nectedly such further thoughts upon them as could not with propriety be
stated upon any former occasion.</P>
<P>Immediately after my arrival, a board of general officers was
appointed to en∣quire into the causes of the failure of the expedition from
Canada. This enquiry was made the foundation of an order against my appearing
at court.</P>
<P>The board reported, that they could not take cognizance of me being
under parole—the prohibition from the King's presence nevertheless
still remained in force.</P>
<P><PB N="134" REF="140"/> I had recourse to parliament for enquiry; and
openly, and repeatedly, and strenu∣ously called upon the ministers to
join issue with me before that tribunal. Objec∣tion was taken against
immediate enquiry, because Generals Sir Guy Carleton and Sir William Howe who
might be parties were absent; but it was evidently the dis∣position of
the house, that an enquiry should be instituted the ensuing
session.</P>
<P>I pledged myself zealously to prosecute that measure; I
accused ministers of inju∣rious treatment towards myself; and it became
my duty, upon occasions with which my own affairs had no connection, to
express deeper resentments of their conduct towards the public.</P>
<P>In this state of things parliament was prorogued on the 3<HI>d of
June.</HI> On the 5<HI>th of June,</HI> I received the first order to repair
to Boston as soon as I had tried the Bath waters. The order and my
answer, representing the hardship of being sent back unheard, and the
second conditional order, with entire slight of my representations, are
too well known to require repetition: but there are two circumstances
attending the dates of these orders with which I was not acquainted till long
after, and which have never yet been taken notice of.</P>
<P>The one is, that at the very time I was told that my presence was
<HI>material,</HI> and (as the second letter from the secretary at war
expressed) of <HI>so much importance to the troops detained prisoners
in New England,</HI> that it must not be dispensed with—at that
very time, it was determined to ratify the convention, according to the
requisition of the Congress; and to transmit the ratification through
other hands, and without any participation with me, or employment of me, in
carrying it to a conclusion. It was very possible, the troops might have
been sailed for England before I had reached America, had I even complied as
early as the condition of either order could possibly be construed to
prescribe. But at all events, the circumstance could not but serve to
mark <HI>to me</HI> the true intent and meaning of the order beyond a
possi∣bility of mistake—<HI>that it was an order of vindictive
punishment;</HI> and my presence with the troops, if I reached America in
time, was <HI>material</HI> and <HI>important</HI> to mark to <HI>them</HI> the
degree of disgrace to which I was reduced. The terms are a mockery, and an
insult upon common sense, if applied, in the situation in which I was
placed, to the service of the King, or the consolation of the troops. Such
a display of ven∣geance might indeed be intended to apply to their prudence,
and to act as a cau∣tion and warning how at their return they should
support a General under the extre∣mity of the King's displeasure.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In times when the maintenance of the constitution in its
purity is the ruling principle of an admi∣nistration, the King's name is
introduced by office only to denote an act of the executive part of the
state. In times when an administration mean to rule by the influence of
monarchy, the language of office is to connect the royal person with the act,
and to give him attributes of passion and displeasure, from which in
his political character he is held exempt. I disclaim language and ideas so
unconstitu∣tional and disrespectful, and never mean to allude to my
Sovereign personally, but in acts of justice and mercy.</NOTE></P>
<P>The other circumstance attending these dates is not less
remarkable, viz.</P>
<P><PB N="135" REF="141"/> The determination of changing the nature of the
war, as afterwards declared by the commissioners in America, must have
been taken at this time.</P>
<P>I am very much disinclined to believe, that the consideration of
my person as a proper victim upon that occasion was ever regularly and
formally debated in the cabinet: but I cannot think it uncharitable to the
individual adviser of the Crown, whoever he was, who could project such an
order, to suppose, that if upon the first exercise of <HI>the extremes
of war</HI> on the one side, and in the ardour of retaliation on the other,
it had so happened, that an object so well to be spared as an obnoxious
and disgraced Lieutenant General, had opportunely presented itself to the
enemy's rigour, and had been detained in their prisons, the order for the
voyage would not have been thought, by that individual, quite thrown away.
Detention, with or without the troops, of a troublesome and bold complainant,
could not be immate∣rial or unimportant to such a person, and the order was
of an import 
<Q> 
<LIST>
<ITEM>"—To make assurance double sure—</ITEM>
<ITEM>"And take a bond of fate—</ITEM>
<ITEM>"That he might tell pale-hearted Fear it lied."</ITEM>
</LIST></Q></P>
<P>The living presence of an injured man is, perhaps, more offensive
and insup∣portable to the sight of a mean injurer, that the spectre of
him would be after death.</P>
<P>But to return to the facts I was recapitulating.</P>
<P>I remained under the conditional order in England.</P>
<P>The ensuing session, the parliamentary enquiry now laid before
the public took place. It ended, as has been stated, in July, 1779.</P>
<P>In September, I received a severe reprimand, a denial of a
court-martial, and a prohibition of serving my country in its exigence,
though other officers precisely in my situation were employed—I
resigned.</P>
<P>The blame laid upon me for the part I took in these transactions
is, that intem∣perately and factiously I engaged in opposition; that I was
guilty of disobedience to the King's orders; and it has been added in a late
publication, that even my de∣fence of my conduct is a libel upon the King's
government.</P>
<P>I think I have perceived, that the first part of these charges, a
rash engagement in opposition, is not combated by some who wish me well
so strenuously as other imputations have been. It may possibly have
appeared to friendly and prudential observers, as a palliating plea for a
restitution to favour upon some future occasion, to have to say, that I
had acted upon the sudden impulse of passion; and the sequel might
be, that I had repented, and would offend no more.</P>
<P>Without doubting the kindness which suggests these excuses,
I have been im∣pelled by principles too forcible, and have taken my part too
decidedly, to look for a resource in those or any other subterfuges. It
would be inconsistent and dis∣honourable in me to withhold a public
declaration upon this occasion, in addition <PB N="136" REF="142"/> to those
I have made upon others, that I engaged in resistance to the measures of
the court upon mature reflection; that after collecting in my mind all the
lights upon men and things which my experience and observation could
furnish, I be∣lieved that the constitution of England was betrayed: and
neither blaming or suspecting any men who conceived different opinions, and
acted upon them, I thought it a point of time in which a man believing as I did
was called upon to sacrifice to his country. The test of this motive, it is
true, must rest between God and my conscience: but let it not be
supposed that I acted blindly—the path of interest, a broad and
beaten track, lay clearly before me from the time I arrived in England. Supple
joints, and an attentive eye, always giving way to power, on one side, and
sometimes pushing my friends into the dirt on the other, would have carried
me safely through. I even believe, that the adviser of the letters I lately
alluded to would rather have seen me in that track, than in the other which
he pre∣scribed for me across the Atlantic.</P>
<P>As little would I be supposed to want discernment of the path I
took: for the barefaced preferences, rewards and punishments held forth for
parliamentary conduct, were among the most glaring parts of the system I
had contemplated. And it was impossible to doubt, that as a delinquent
<HI>there,</HI> I should be pressed both by art and vengeance to the end
the enemies I had provoked foresaw—the loss of my profession and
the impoverishment of my fortune. I trust it will be an inno∣cent revenge
on my part, to shew them I can bear my condition firmly; and that I am
incapable of redeeming what I have lost, were it ever in my option, by the
disavowal of a single principle I have professed.</P>
<P>I come now to the second charge, disobedience of orders; and in a
point that so nearly touches the very essence of military character, I
trust I shall not tres∣pass upon the patience of the reader, if I treat
it a little more at large than I have done in my correspondence with the
secretary at war.</P>
<P>I admit that subordination and implicit obedience, as applied to the
operation of arms, are primary principles in the military system. An army
is a mere name without them. The officer who hesitates to meet certain death
upon command, deserves to receive it from the hand of the executioner.</P>
<P>But there are possible exceptions to these general principles,
especially out of the field, in the most absolute services; and in the
British service they are known and marked, and co-existent with the
military establishment itself, in the mutiny act, which confines
obedience to legal commands. An army must again be garbled like the army of
Cromwell (which God avert!) before an order could be executed, like that of
Cromwell, for garbling the parliament.</P>
<P>A high spirit will contract the limits of obedience still more;
with illegal, he will reject dishonourable commands; and he will follow the
reasoning I have al∣ready premised, and state it as a maxim thus: <HI>he
who obeys at the expence of for∣tune,</HI> <PB N="137" REF="143"/> <HI>comfort,
health and life, is a soldier; he who obeys at the expence of honour is a
slave.</HI></P>
<P>But I may be asked by some disciplinarians, who is to be the
judge in these nice definitions of obedience? It is uncommon military
doctrine, I may be told, to rea∣son upon the King's orders—I confess
it is so. Since the reign of James the Second, in the British service it
never has been necessary. We have been used in this age, to see the
King's name give wings and inspiration to duty. Discipline, in this
country, has been raised upon personal honour—a firmer basis than
fear or servility ever furnished: and the minister who first shakes
that happy confidence; who turns military command to political craft; who dares
to use his gracious Sovereign's name as an engine of state, to glut his own
anger, or to remove his own fears, he is amongst the worst enemies to that
Sovereign. But should his purposes go further (a consideration of far
greater magnitude to the public) and should it be seen that the royal name
was brought forth for the <HI>discipline</HI> of parliament, the minister
so using it would be not only an enemy to his Sovereign, but a traitor to
the constitu∣tion of the state.</P>
<P>I will close the defence of my principles respecting military
subordination by re∣ference to an anecdote well authenticated and not very
remote.</P>
<P>An officer in a neighbouring nation, for some error he had committed
in a day of battle, received a blow from his prince who commanded in person.
The officer drew a pistol, and his first movement was to point it at his
master; but the next (and it was instantaneous) was to turn the muzzle, and
discharge the ball into his own heart. Though my case differs both in the
provocation and the consequence, in many circumstances my conduct may
justly be supported upon the same princi∣ple. I receive an affront that a
liberal spirit cannot endure; and in a name, against which no personal
resentment can be pursued, nor indeed entertained: but a suicide of my
professional existence (if I may be allowed the phrase) is preferable
to the state in which the affront placed me. In one instance only I
renounce the parallel—God forbid I should be thought, even in a burst
of passion, to have pointed at my Sovereign! It was not from his hand I
received the blow.</P>
<P>I shall solicit the reader's attention very little further: but I
feel the necessity of repeating my application to the candour of the
public, both as a writer and an appellant. Defence, and imputation of blame to
others, are naturally interwoven in my cause: it required a more distinct
conception, and an abler hand than mine, to keep them always apart, and open to
separate view. In some parts my defence may be weakened by this deficiency
of skill: but I have no right to offer the same excuse for suffering
any blame to rest upon others beyond what I thought myself justified to
support.</P>
<P>Upon this principle, I think it just, at taking leave of the
secretary of state for the American department, briefly to enumerate the
only facts and propositions re∣specting <PB N="138" REF="144"/> the plan of
the expedition from Canada, that I think clearly maintainable against
him.</P>
<P>First fact. It is clear that the plan of a junction of the greater
part of the forces in Canada with the army of Sir William Howe, was formed in
the year 1776, when Sir William Howe was in full success; when his whole
force was in the neighbourhood of New York, or in the Jersies, and Mr.
Washington was beaten, and at the weakest.</P>
<P>Second fact. This plan of a junction was continued (and upon just
reasoning) in the close of the year 1776, when Sir William Howe's first
proposal of operations for the ensuing campaign arrived. Those
proposals were made upon the datum of a number of troops, sufficient to
furnish, besides the main army, an <HI>offensive</HI> army of 10,000 men,
rank and file, to act on the side of Rhode Island, by taking
possession of Providence, and penetrating from thence into the country
towards Boston; and another <HI>offensive</HI> army, not less than
10,000, to move up the North River to Alba∣ny, exclusive of 5000 for the
defence of New York.</P>
<P>In either of the above cases, the plan of junction could hardly have
failed of success.</P>
<P>Third fact. On the 23d of February, Sir William Howe's alteration of
the first plan was received, and he then proposed to act with the greater
part of his force on the side of Philadelphia, at the opening of the
campaign, and to enable him so to do, to defer the <HI>offensive plan from
Rhode Island till the reinforcements should arrive,</HI> and to destine
only 3000 men to act <HI>defensively</HI> upon the lower part of the
Hudson's River.</P>
<P>Fourth fact. On the 3d of March, the secretary of state
signified his Majesty's entire approbation of this deviation from the plan
first suggested.</P>
<P>From these facts arises my first proposition, that at the time
the change of plan for Sir William Howe's operations was adopted, by which no
offensive force was to remain upon the Hudson's River, nor a diversion
probably to take place from Rhode Island, the plan of my operations, the
success of which would probably de∣pend in a great degree upon co-operation
and diversion, ought to have been changed likewise: instead of that, it
was enforced and made positive by the refusal of the latitude I had
proposed of acting upon the Connecticut, or, in case of exigency, embarking
the troops and effecting the junction by sea.</P>
<P>Fifth fact. On the 19th of March, a letter from Sir William Howe, by
the secre∣tary of state, acquainting him, that a brigade of British and
some companies of bri∣gadiers and light infantry had been withdrawn from
Rhode Island, which made the force left there merely defensive. The same
letter mentions the prospects the ene∣my had of bringing 50,000 men into the
field.</P>
<P>Sixth fact. I did not leave England till the beginning of April, by
which time the secretary of state must have known, or ought to have
known, that no depen∣dance could be placed upon reinforcements from England
arriving at New York in time for Sir William Howe to resume the intention he
had deferred, viz. a diversion <PB N="139" REF="145"/> from Rhode Island, or
of making the force upon the Hudson's River adequate to offensive
operation.</P>
<P>Hence arises my second proposition, that the latitude I had
proposed, or other expedients of precaution, ought then at least to have
been adopted: instead of which, I was suffered to sail, ignorant of Sir
William Howe's plans, and ignorant of the defalcation or the delays in the
reinforcements destined for him. The con∣sequence was, that neither his
letter to Sir Guy Carleton, put into my hands after my arrival in Canada, nor
his letter to me of the 17th of June, informing me of his destination for
Pensylvania, removed my expectation of co-operation, because I was to
suppose, that subsequent to the dates of either of those letters, he
would re∣ceive orders from the secretary of state respecting the
junction, and also a timely reinforcement.</P>
<P>Seventh fact. The secretary of state makes no mention of the
northern expedi∣tion in any of his dispatches to Sir William Howe at the end
of March, when my orders were fixed, nor in the month of April. And it is a
further fact, that I am persuaded will not be contested, that he did not
mention any orders or recommenda∣tions relative to co-operation verbally to Sir
William Howe's aid-de-camp, or any other confidential person who sailed
about that time.</P>
<P>The first mention made of the necessity of co-operation was in
the secretary of state's letter of the 18<HI>th of May,</HI> wherein his
Lordship 
<Q REND="inline">"<HI>Trusts that whatever he [Sir William Howe] may
meditate, it will be executed in time to co-operate with the army ordered to
proceed from Canada.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>The proposition clearly justified by these facts is, that if the
secretary of state had thought proper to signify the King's expectation
of a co-operation to be made in my favour in the month of March or beginning of
April, as in consistency he ought to have done, it would have arrived
before Sir William Howe embarked his army, and in time for him to have made a
new disposition: but instead of that, this very material injunction was
not dispatched till it was almost physically impossible it should
have any effect. And so indeed it happened, for Sir William Howe received it
on the 16th of August, at a distance from Hudson's River too great for
any de∣tachment from his own army to be made in time, could it even have been
spared; and the reinforcement from England, upon which Sir William Howe
depended to strengthen Sir Henry Clinton, was much later still—too
late (as it has been shewn) to enable that general with all his activity and
zeal to give any effectual support.</P>
<P>Indeed the conduct of the secretary of state, in inserting this
paragraph, in his letter of the 18th of May, when it could not avail, after
omitting it when certainly it would have been timely, seems so
preposterous, that it can only be explained by one fact. It transpired
about that time, that Sir William Howe's a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>y was destined for Pensylvania, and people who had considered
the force of the enemy to be collect∣ed from the northern provinces began to be
alarmed for my army. It is well known <PB N="140" REF="146"/> (though I cannot
ascertain the date) that an officer of very great ability, and a per∣fect
knowledge in the country through which I was to pass, as soon as he heard
no disposition was made for a support from New York, foretold to the
secretary of state, or his near friends, the fall of my army. Under this
apprehension it might appear to the secretary of state a proper caution,
that an expectation of co-operation should exist under his hand.</P>
<P>If plans so inconsistently formed, and managed by the
secretary of state with so much seeming confidence, as to mislead his
generals, and so much real reserve as to destroy them, should be
defended by that infatuated belief then entertained of the inability of the
enemy to resist, I should beg leave to state, as one proposition
more, that after the experience of their actions at Trenton, and many other
places, and the intelligence of their new levies received from Sir William
Howe, such con∣fidence was an additional fault, and perhaps a more pernicious
one than any I have stated.</P>
<P>Thus much for the noble Lord in his public capacity. What share of
the perse∣cution I have sustained (more than I have directly
expressed in different parts of my defence) are imputable to his private
councils, is not within my knowledge: but if in speaking of my persecutors
in general, I may be thought sometimes to have used strong terms, I have
only to say, that having advanced no fact which I am not able and resolved
to maintain, I have not felt myself called upon, in applying those facts
for any further attention, than to preserve the language of a gentleman,
which is an attention due to myself as well as to the public. It is open and
manly enmity alone that unites respect with resentment.</P>
<P>I wish I could as easily apologise for all the other faults with
which this under∣taking abounds as a composition. At a time when so many
pens are employed, I must not expect to be spared. I shall treat with
silent respect any comments that are fairly founded and delivered with
liberality; and with contempt, equally silent, the common invectives of the
political press. This appeal is not to rest upon li∣terary criticism, or
party disputation, but upon the broad equity of my country. I know that
prejudice and malice will vanish before the man who dares to submit his
actions to that test—If acquitted <HI>there,</HI> I feel I am not
degraded; and I have not a sensation within my breast which does not at
the same time assure me, I can∣not be unhappy.</P>

<LETTER>
<P>THE rapid success of his Majesty's arms, in driving the
rebels out of Canada, does great honour to your conduct, and I hope soon to
hear that you have been able to pursue them across the lakes, and to
possess those posts upon the frontiers which may effectually secure
your province from any future insult.</P>
<P><PB N="ii" REF="148"/> His Majesty, in appointing you commander
in chief of his forces in Canada, was pleased to extend your commission
to the frontiers of his provinces bordering thereupon, wisely foreseeing,
that it might be necessary for the compleating your plan of operations,
that you should march your army beyond the limits of your own government. I
trust, before this letter reaches you, that you will, by your spirit and
activity, have cleared the frontiers of Canada of all the rebel forces, and
will have taken the proper measures for keeping possession of the
lakes. That service being performed, his Majesty commands me to acquaint
you, that there still remains another part of your duty to be undertaken,
which will require all your abilities and the strictest application, the
restoring peace, and the establish∣ing good order and legal government in
Canada. It is an object of the greatest importance to this country, the
difficulties attending it are immense; but his Majesty depends upon your
zeal, and upon your experience, for carrying it into execution. His Majesty,
ever anxious for the happiness of his subjects, com∣mands me to inform you,
that no time should be lost in beginning so important a work, and that
you do therefore return to Quebec, detaching Lieutenant-General Burgoyne, or
such other officer as you shall think most proper, with that part of your
forces which can be spared from the immediate defence of your province, to
carry on such operations as shall be most conducive to the success of
the army acting on the side of New-York; and that you direct the officer so
detached to commu∣nicate with and put himself, as soon as possible,
under the command of General Howe, you will order such artillery as you
shall judge necessary to proceed with this detachment; and as a great
quantity of heavy cannon and military stores were sent, upon the
supposition that Quebec might have been in the hands of the rebels, you
will, upon requisition from General Howe, supply him with such cannon and
stores as may not be wanted for the protection of Canada.</P>

<HEAD><NOTE PLACE="marg">No. III.</NOTE>Thoughts for conducting the
War from the Side of <HI>Canada.</HI></HEAD>
<BYLINE>By Lieutenant-General <HI>Burgoyne.</HI></BYLINE>
<P>WHEN the last ships came from Quebec, a report prevailed in
Canada, said to have been founded upon positive evidence, that the rebels
had laid the keels of several large vessels at Skenesborough and
Ticonderoga, and were resolved to exert their utmost powers, to construct
a new and formidable fleet during the winter.</P>
<P>I will not, however, give credit to their exertions, in such a
degree as to imagine the King's troops will be prevented passing Lake
Champlain early in the summer, but will suppose the operations of the
army to begin from Crown Point.</P>
<P>But as the present means to form effectual plans is to lay down
every possible difficulty, I will suppose the enemy in great force at
Ticonderoga; the different works there are capable of admitting twelve
thousand men.</P>
<P>I will suppose him also to occupy Lake George with a
considerable naval strength, in order to secure his retreat, and
afterwards to retard the campaign; and it is natural to expect that he will
take measures to block up the roads from Ticonderoga to Albany by the way of
Skenesborough, by fortifying the strong ground at different places, and
thereby obliging the King's army to carry a <PB N="iii" REF="149"/> weight of
artillery with it, and by felling trees, breaking bridges, and other obvious
impediments, to delay, though he should not have power or spirit finally to
resist, its progress.</P>
<P>The enemy thus disposed upon the side of Canada, it is to be
considered what troops will be necessary, and what disposition of
them will be most proper to pro∣secute the campaign with vigour and
effect.</P>
<P>I humbly conceive the operating army (I mean exclusively of the
troops left for the security of Canada) ought not to consist of less
than eight thousand regulars, rank and file. The artillery required in the
memorandums of General Carleton, a corps of watermen, two thousand Canadians,
including hatchet-men and other workmen, and one thousand or more
savages.</P>
<P>It is to be hoped that the reinforcement and the victualllng
ships may all be ready to sail from the Channel and from Corke on the
last day of March. I am per∣suaded that to sail with a fleet of
transports earlier, is to subject government to loss and
disappointment. It may reasonably be expected that they will reach Quebec
before the 20th of May, a period in full time for opening the campaign. The
roads, and the rivers and lakes, by the melting and running off of the snows,
are in common years impracticable sooner.</P>
<P>But as the weather long before that time will probably have
admitted of labour in the docks, I will take for granted that the fleet of
last year, as well bateaux as armed vessels, will be found repaired,
augmented, and fit for immediate service. The magazines that remain of
provision, I believe them not to be abundant, will probably be formed at
Montreal, Sorel and Chamblée.</P>
<P>I conceive the first business for those entrusted with
the chief powers, should be to select and post the troops destined to
remain in Canada; to throw up the military stores and provision with all
possible dispatch, in which service the abovementioned troops, if
properly posted, will greatly assist; and to draw the army destined
for ope∣ration to cantonments, within as few days march of St. John's as
conveniently may be. I should prefer cantonments at that season of the
year to encampment, as the ground is very damp, and consequently very
pernicious to the men, and more especially as they will have been for many
months before used to lodgings, heated with stoves, or between decks in
ships; all these operations may be put in motion together, but they
severally require some observation.</P>
<P>I should wish that the troops left in Canada, supposing
the number mentioned in my former memorandum to be approved, might be made as
follows.

</TABLE></P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="150"/> My reason for selecting the 31st
regiment for this duty is, that when I saw it last it was not equally in
order with the other regiments for services of activity.</P>
<P>I propose the 29th regiment as it is not at present
brigaded.</P>
<P>I propose Maclean's corps, because I very much apprehend
desertion from such parts of it as are composed of Americans, should
they come near the enemy.</P>
<P>In Canada, whatsoever may be their disposition, it is not
so easy to effect it.</P>
<P>And I propose making up the residue by detachment, because
by selecting the men least calculated for fatigue or least accustomed
to it, which may be equally good soldiers in more confined movements and
better provided situations, the effective strength for operation is much
greater and the defensive strength not impaired.</P>
<P>I must beg leave to state the expeditious conveyance of
provision and stores from Quebec, and the several other depositaries,
in order to form ample magazines at Crown Point, as one of the most important
operations of the campaign, because it is upon that which most of the
rest will depend. If sailing vessels up the St. Lawrence are alone to
be employed, the accident of contrary winds may delay them two months before
they pass the rapids of Richelieu, and afterwards St. Peter's Lake; delays to
that extent are not uncommon, and they are only to be obviated by having a
quantity of small craft in readiness to work with oars. From the mouth of
the Sorrel to Chamblée, rowing and tacking is a sure conveyance if
sufficient hands are found. From Chamblée to St. Therese (which is
just above the Rapids) land-carriage must be used, and great authority
will be requisite to supply the quantity necessary.</P>
<P>A business thus complicated in arrangement, in some parts
unusual in practice, and in others perhaps difficult, can only be carried to
the desired effect by the peremptory powers, warm zeal, and consonant
opinion of the governor; and though the former are not to be doubted, a failure
in the latter, vindicated, or seeming to be vindicated, by the plausible
obstructions that will not fail to be suggested by others, will be
sufficient to crush such exertions as an officer of a sanguine temper,
entrusted with the future conduct of the campaign, and whose personal
interest and fame therefore consequentially depend upon a timely out-set,
would be led to make.</P>
<P>The assembly of the savages and the Canadians will also
entirely depend upon the governor.</P>
<P>Under these considerations, it is presumed, that the general
officer employed to proceed with the army will be held to be out of the reach
of any possible blame till he is clear of the province of Canada, and
furnished with the proposed supplies.</P>
<P>The navigation of Lake Champlain, secured by the superiority
of our naval force, and the arrangements for forming proper magazines so
established as to make the execution certain, I would not lose a day to
take possession of Crown Point with Brigadier Fraser's corps, a large
body of savages, a body of Canadians, both for scouts and works, and the
best of our engineers and artificers well supplied with intrenching
tools.</P>
<P>The brigade would be sufficient to prevent insult during the
time necessary for collecting the stores, forming magazines, and
fortifying the posts; all which should be done to a certain degree,
previous to proceeding in force to Ticonde∣roga; <PB N="v" REF="151"/> to such
a degree I mean as may be supposed to be effected in time of
trans∣porting artillery, preparing fascines, and other necessaries for
artillery operations; and by keeping the rest of the army back during that
period, the transport of provisions wil be lessened, and the soldiers
made of use in forwarding the convoys.</P>
<P>But though there would be only one brigade at Crown Point at that
time, it does not follow that the enemy should remain in a state of
tranquility. Corps of savages, supported by detachments of light regulars,
should be continually on foot to keep them in alarm, and within their works
to cover the reconnoitering of general officers and engineers, and to obtain
the best intelligence of their strength, position, and design.</P>
<P>If due exertion is made in the preparations stated above, it may
be hoped that Ticonderoga will be reduced early in the summer, and it will
then become a more proper place for arms than Crown Point.</P>
<P>The next measure must depend upon those taken by the enemy,
and upon the general plan of the campaign as concerted at home. If it be
determined that General Howe's whole forces should act upon Hudson's River,
and to the south∣ward of it, and that the only object of the Canada army be
to effect a junction with that force, the immediate possession of Lake
George would be of great con∣sequence, as the most expeditious and most
commodious route to Albany; and should the enemy be in force upon that lake,
which is very probable, every effort should be tried, by throwing savages
and light troops round it, to oblige them to quit it without waiting for naval
preparations. Should those efforts fail, the route by South Bay and
Skenesborough might be attempted, but considerable diffi∣culties may be
expected, as the narrow parts of the river may be easily choaked up and
rendered impassable, and at best there will be necessity for a great
deal of of land carriage for the artillery, provision, &amp;c. which can only
be supplied from Canada. In case of success also by that route, and
the enemy not removed from Lake George, it will be necessary to leave a
chain of posts, as the army proceeds, for the securities of your
communication, which may too much weaken so small an army.</P>
<P>Lest all these attempts should unavoidably fail, and it
become indispensibly necessary to attack the enemy by water upon Lake
George, the army at the outset should be provided with carriages,
implements, and artificers, for conveying armed vessels from Ticonderoga to
the lake.</P>
<P>These ideas are formed upon the supposition, that it be the
sole purpose of the Canada army to effect a junction with General Howe, or
after co-operating so far as to get possession of Albany and open the
communication to New-York, to remain upon the Hudson's River, and thereby
enable that general to act with his whole force to the southward.</P>
<P>But should the strength of the main American army be such as
to admit of the corps of troops now at Rhode Island remaining there during
the winter, and acting separately in the spring, it may be highly worthy
consideration, whether the most important purpose to which the Canada
army could be employed, supposing it in possession of Ticonderoga,
would not be to gain the Connecticut River.</P>
<P>The extent of country from Ticonderoga to the inhabited country
upon that river, opposite to Charles Town, is about sixty miles, and though
to convey artil∣lery and provision so far by land would be attended with
difficulties, perhaps more <PB N="vi" REF="152"/> than those above
suggested, upon a progress to Skenesborough, should the object appear
worthy, it is to be hoped resources might be found; in that case it would
be adviseable to fortify with one or two strong redoubts the heights
opposite to Charles Town, and establish posts of savages upon the
passage from Ticonderoga to those heights, to preserve the
communication, and at the same time prevent any attempt from the country
above Charles Town, which is very populous, from molesting the rear or
interrupting the convoys of supply, while the army proceeded down the
Connecticut. Sould the junction between the Canada and Rhode Island armies be
effected upon the Connecticut, it is not too sanguine an expectation that all
the New England provinces will be reduced by their operations.</P>
<P>To avoid breaking in upon other matter, I omitted in the beginning
of these papers to state the idea of an expedition at the outset of the
campaign by the Lake Ontario and Oswego to the Mohawk River, which, as a
diversion to facilitate every proposed operation, would be highly
desirable, provided the army should be rein∣forced sufficiently to afford
it.</P>
<P>It may at first appear, from a view of the present strength
of the army, that it may bear the sort of detachment proposed by myself
last year for this purpose; but it is to be considered that at that time
the utmost object of the campaign, from the advanced season and
unavoidable delay of preparation for the lakes, being the reduction of Crown
Point and Ticonderoga, unless the success of my expedition had opened the
road to Albany, no greater numbers were necessary than for those first
operations. The case in the present year differs; because the season
of the year affording a prospect of very extensive operation, and
consequently the esta∣blishment of many posts, patroles, &amp;c. will
become necessary. The army ought to be in a state of numbers to bear
those drains, and still remain sufficient to attack any thing that
probably can be opposed to it.</P>
<P>Nor, to argue from probability, is so much force necessary
for this diversion this year, as was required for the last; because we
then knew that General Schuyler with a thousand men, was fortified upon the
Mohawk. When the different situ∣ations of things are considered, viz. the
progress of General Howe, the early invasion from Canada, the threatening
of the Connecticut from Rhode Island, &amp;c. it is not to be imagined that
any detachment of such force as that of Schulyer can be supplied by the
enemy for the Mohawk. I would not therefore propose it of more (and I have
great diffidence whether so much can be prudently afforded) than Sir John
Johnson's corps, an hundred British from the second brigade, and an
hundred more from the 8th regiment, with four pieces of the lightest
artillery, and a body of savages; Sir John Johnson to be with a detachment
in person, and an able field officer to command it. I should wish
Lieutenant Colonel St. Leger for that em∣ployment.</P>
<P>I particularize the second brigade, because the first is
proposed to be diminished by the 31st regiment remaining in Canada, and
the rest of the regiment drafted for the expedition being made also part of
the Canada force, the two brigades will be exactly squared.</P>
<P>Should it appear, upon examination of the really effective numbers
of the Canada army, that the force is not sufficient for proceeding upon the
above ideas with a fair prospect of success, the alternative remains of
embarking the army at Quebec, in order to effect a junction with General Howe
by sea, or to be employed sepa∣rately <PB N="vii" REF="153"/> rately to
co-operate with the main designs, by such means as should be within their
strength upon other parts of the continent. And though the army, upon
examina∣tion of the numbers from the returns here, and the reinforcements
designed, should appear adequate, it is humbly submitted, as a security
against the possibility of its remaining inactive, whether it might not
be expedient to entrust the latitude of embarking the army by sea to the
commander in chief, provided any accidents du∣ring the winter, and unknown
here, should have diminished the numbers consider∣ably, or that the
enemy, from any winter success to the southward, should have been able
to draw such forces towards the frontiers of Canada, and take up their ground
with such precaution, as to render the intended measure impracticable or
too ha∣zardous. But in that case it must be considered that more force
would be required to be left behind for the security of Canada, than is
supposed to be necessary when an army is beyond the lakes; and I do not
conceive any expedition from the sea can be so formidable to the enemy, or
so effectual to close the war, as an invasion from Canada by Ticonderoga.
This last measure ought not to be thought of, but upon positive
conviction of its necessity.</P>

<HEAD><NOTE PLACE="marg">No. IV.</NOTE>Extract of a Letter from Lord
<HI>George Germain</HI> to General <HI>Carleton,</HI> dated <HI>Whitehall,</HI>
26th <HI>March,</HI> 1777.</HEAD>
<LETTER>
<P>MY letter of the 22d August, 1776, was intrusted to the care
of Captain Le Maitre, one of your aid-de-camps; after having been three times
in the Gulph of St. Lawrence he had the mortification to find it impossible
to make his passage to Quebec, and therefore returned to England with my
dispatch; which, though it was prevented by that accident from reaching your
hands in due time, I nevertheless think proper to transmit to you by this
earliest opportunity.</P>
<P>You will be informed, by the contents thereof, that as soon as
you should have driven the rebel forces from the frontiers of Canada, it was
his Majesty's pleasure that you should return to Quebec, and take with
you such part of your army as in your judgment and discretion appeared
sufficient for the defence of the province; that you should detach
Lieutenant General Burgoyne, or such other officer as you should think
most proper, with the remainder of the troops, and direct the officer so
detached to proceed with all possible expedition to join General Howe, and
to put himself under his command.</P>
<P>With a view of quelling the rebellion as soon as possible,
it is become highly ne∣cessary that the most speedy junction of the two
armies should be effected; and therefore, as the security and good
government of Canada absolutely require your presence there, it is the
King's determination to leave about 3000 men under your command, for the
defence and duties of that province, and to employ the remainder of your army
upon two expeditions, the one under the command of Lieutenant Ge∣neral
Burgoyne, who is to force his way to Albany, and the other under the com∣mand
of Lieutenant Colonel St. Leger, who is to make a diversion on the Mohawk
River.</P>
<P>As this plan cannot be advantageously executed without the
assistance of Cana∣dians and Indians, his Majesty strongly recommends
it to your care, to furnish both <PB N="viii" REF="154"/> expeditions with
good and sufficient bodies of those men; and I am happy in know∣ing that
your influence among them is so great, that there can be no room to
ap∣prehend you will find it difficult to fulfil his Majesty's
expectations.</P>
<P>In order that no time may be lost in entering upon these
important undertakings, General Burgoyne has received orders to sail
forthwith for Quebec; and that the in∣tended operations may be maturely
considered, and afterwards carried on in such a manner as is most likely
to be followed by success, he is directed to consult with you upon the
subject, and to form and adjust the plan as you both shall think most
con∣ducive to his Majesty's service.</P>
<P>I am also to acquaint you, that as soon as you shall have
fully regulated every thing relative to these expeditions (and the King
relies upon your zeal, that you will be as expeditious as the nature of the
business will admit) it is his Majesty's plea∣sure that you detain for
the Canada service

<P>You will naturally conclude that this allotment for Canada has
not been made without properly weighing the several duties which are likely
to be required. His Majesty has not only considered the several
garrisons and posts which probably it may be necessary for you to take,
<HI>viz.</HI> Quebec, Chaudiére, the disaffected parishes of Point
Levi, Montreal, and posts between that town and Oswegatche, Trois Rivieres,
St. John's, Sele aux Noix, La Prairie, Vergere, and some other towns upon the
south shore of St. Lawrence, opposite the isle of Montreal, with
posts of communi∣cation to St. John's, but he hath also reflected that the
several operations which will be carrying on in different parts of America
must necessarily confine the attention of the rebels to the respective
scenes of action, and secure Canada from external at∣tacks, and that the
internal quiet which at present prevails is not likely to be in∣terrupted, or
if interrupted, will soon be restored by your influence over the
inha∣bitants; he therefore trusts that 3000 men will be quite sufficient to
answer every possible demand.</P>
<P>It is likewise his Majesty's pleasure that you put under
the command of Lieute∣nant General Burgoyne

to give him orders to pass Lake Champlain, and from thence, by the most
vigorous exertion of the force under his command, to proceed with all
expedition to Albany, and put himself under the command of Sir William

<P>From the King's knowledge of the great preparations made by you
last year to secure the command of the lakes, and your attention to this
part of the service du∣ring the winter, his Majesty is led to expect that
every thing will be ready for Ge∣neral Burgoyne's passing the lakes by the
time you and he shall have adjusted the plan of the expedition.</P>
<P>It is the King's further pleasure that you put under the

you are to give him orders to proceed forthwith to and down the Mo∣hawk River
to Albany, and put himself under the command of Sir William Howe.</P>
<P>I shall write to Sir William Howe from hence by the first
packet; but you will nevertheless endeavour to give him the earliest
intelligence of this measure, and also direct Lieutenant General Burgoyne,
and Lieutenant Colonel St. Leger, to neglect no opportunity of doing the
same, that they may receive instructions from Sir William Howe. You will at
the same time inform them, that, until they shall have received orders from
Sir William Howe, it is his Majesty's pleasure that they act as exigencies
may require, and in such manner as they shall judge most proper for
mak∣ing an impression on the rebels, and bringing them to obedience; but
that in so doing, they must never lose view of their intended junctions
with Sir William Howe as their principal objects.</P>
<P>In case Lieutenant General Burgoyne or Lieutenant Colonel St.
Leger should hap∣pen to die, or be rendered, through illness, incapable of
executing those great trusts, you are to nominate to their respective
commands, such officer or officers as you shall think best qualified to
supply the place of those whom his Majesty has in his wisdom at
present appointed to conduct these expeditions.</P>

<LETTER>
<HEADNOTE>
<P>[Private.]</P>
</HEADNOTE>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I TAKE the opportunity of a vessel dispatched by Sir Guy
Carleton to England, to inform your Lordship of my arrival here the 6th
instant. And though my present situation, as acting under a superior
upon the spot, may make an official correspon∣dence unnecessary, I
cannot persuade myself I shall not appear guilty of impropriety in
assuming the honour of a private and confidential one, relatively to the
objects of my destination.</P>
<P>From my present information, I have reason to expect the
preparations for open∣ing the campaign to be very forward on our part. Due
exertions were used in the course of the winter, and the uncommon
mildness of the weather greatly favoured them, to convey provisions to
Chamblé and St. John's. One large victualler ar∣rived after I left the
St. Lawrence last November; all residues of other victuallers have been
collected; I am in hopes of finding a sufficiency of provision to enable me
to cross the Lake Champlain at least, without the arrival of the Corke
fleet. I hope also to find artillery stores enough to feel the pulse of
the enemy at Ticondero∣ga. Should their situation and resolution be such
as to make great artillery prepa∣rations requisite. I shall certainly be
under the necessity of waiting at Crown Point the arrival of the ordnance
ships from England. A good body of the Indians I am assured are ready to
move upon the first call, and measures are taking for bringing them
forthwith to proper redezvous.</P>
<P>I cannot speak with so much confidence of the military
assistance I am to look for from the Canadians. The only corps yet
instituted, or that I am informed can at present be instituted, are three
independent companies of 100 men each, officered by Seigneurs of the country,
who are well chosen; but they have not been able to engage many volunteers.
The men are chiefly drafted from the militia, according to a late regulation of
the legislative council. Those I have yet seen afford no pro∣mise of
use of arms—aukwark, ignorant, disinclined to the service, and
spiritless. Various reasons are assigned for this change in the
natives since the time of the French government. It may partly be owing to a
disuse of arms, but I believe principally to the unpopularity of their
Seigneurs, and to the poison which the emissaries of the rebels have
thrown into their minds. Should I find the new com∣panies up the country better
composed, or that the well affected parties can be pre∣vailed upon to turn
out volunteers, though but for a short occasion, as they did last year, I
shall move Sir Guy to exert further measures to augment my numbers.</P>
<P>The army will fall short of the strength computed in
England; the want of the camp equipage, cloathing, and many other necessary
articles, will cause inconve∣nience; I am nevertheless determined to put
the troops destined for my command immediately in motion; and, assisted
by the spirit and health in which they abound, I am confident in the
prospect of overcoming difficulties and disappoint∣ments.</P>
<P>Having settled all measures with Sir Guy Carleton, both
for this purpose and for the expeditious transport of the stores as they
may arrive, and having already dis∣patched instructions to Captain
Lutwidge, who commands the fleet upon Lake <PB N="xi" REF="157"/> Champlain, to
secure the navigation, in which I clearly see he will find no trouble, I
shall proceed in person this afternoon for Montreal, and from thence make
my final arrangements for pursuing the King's orders.</P>
<P>I should think myself deficient in justice and in
honour, were I close my letter without mentioning the sense I entertain
of General Carleton's conduct; that he was anxiously desirous of leading
the military operations out of the province, is easi∣ly to be discerned;
but his deference to his Majesty's decision, and his zeal to give effect to
his measures in my hands, are equally manifest, exemplary, and
satisfactory. I shall take every possible means to transmit to your
Lordship an account of my pro∣ceedings from time to time, and have the honour
to be, with perfect respect,</P>
<CLOSER>
<SIGNED>Your Lordship's most obedient and most humble
servant, J. BURGOYNE.</SIGNED> <POSTSCRIPT>
<P>P. S. I have mentioned nothing of intelligence concerning
the enemy, con∣cluding that Sir Guy Carleton will transmit the material part
of it, and in a manner more full than in my power to do. I understand they
have laboured hard to strengthen Ticonderoga, and threaten a vigorous
resistance there, and that they have built some vessels on Lake
George, as your Lordship may remember I had foreseen.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAD the honour to write to your Lordship the day I left
Quebec, having rea∣son to imagine this letter may reach that place in time to
be dispatched with my former one, I cannot omit the occasion to inform your
Lordship, that the hopes I expressed of being able to put the troops in
motion without waiting the arrival of the fleets from England and Ireland, are
confirmed.</P>
<P>The only delay is occasioned by the impracticability of the
roads, owing to late extraordinary heavy rains, and this difficulty will be
speedily removed, by exerting the services of the parishes as soon as
the weather clears. In the mean time, I am employing every means that water
carriage will admit for drawing the troops and stores towards their point. I
trust, I shall have vessels sufficient to move the army and stores
together, and in that case, will take post at once, within sight of
Ticon∣deroga, and only make use of Crown Point for my hospital and
magazine.</P>
<P>A continuation of intelligence from different spies and
deserters, confirms the de∣sign of the enemy to dispute Ticonderoga
vigorously. They are also building bow∣gallies at Fort George, for the
defence of that Lake, &amp;c. fortifying on the road to Skenesborough.</P>
<P>It is consigned to the New England colonies, to furnish
supplies of men and pro∣vision to oppose the progress of my army, and
they have undertaken the task, upon condition of being exempt from
supplying Mr. Washington's main army.</P>
<P>It is my design, while advancing to Ticonderago, and during
the siege of that post, for a siege I apprehend it must be, to give all
possible jealousy on the side of Connecticut. If I can by manoeuvre
lead the enemy to suspect, that after the reduc∣tion of Ticonderago, my
views are pointed that way, the Connecticut forces will be 
<PB N="xii" REF="158"/> very cautious of leaving their own frontier, and I may
gain a start that may much expedite and facilitate my progress to
Albany.</P>
<P>Your Lordship may rest assured, that, whatever
demonstration I may endeavour to impose on the enemy, I shall
<HI>really</HI> make no movement that can procrastinate the great object of
my orders.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>CHIEFS and WARRIORS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE great King, our common father, and the patron of all who
seek and deserve his protection, has considered with satisfaction the
general conduct of the Indian tribes from the beginning of the troubles in
America. Too sagacious and too faithful to be deluded or corrupted, they have
observed the violated rights of the parental power they love, and burned to
vindicate them. A few individuals alone, the refuse of a small tribe, at
the first were led astray, and the misrepresentations, the specious
al∣lurements, the insidious promises and diversified plots, in which the
rebels are exer∣cised, and all of which they employed for that effect, have
served only in the end to enhance the honour of the tribes in general, by
demonstrating to the world, how few and how contemptible are the apostates.
It is a truth known to you all, that these pitiful examples excepted, and
they probably have before this day hid their faces in shame, the collective
voices and hands of the Indian tribes over this vast con∣tinent, are on the
side of justice, of law, and of the King.</P>
<P>The restraint you have put upon your resentment in waiting
the King your father's call to arms, the hardest proof, I am persuaded, to
which your affection could have been put, is another manifest and affected
mark of your adherence to that principle of connection to which you were always
fond to allude, and which it is mutually the joy and the duty of the parent to
cherish.</P>
<P>The clemency of your father has been abused, the offers of
his mercy have been despised, and his farther patience would, in his eyes,
become culpable, in as much as it would withold redress from the most
grievous oppressions in the provinces thatever dis∣graced the history
of mankind. It therefore remains for me, the General of one of his Majesty's
armies, and in this council his representative, to release you from those
bonds which your obedience imposed.—Warriors, you are free—Go
forth in might of your valour and your cause; strike at the common enemies
of Great-Britain and America—disturbers of public order, peace, and
happiness—destroyers of commerce, parricides of the state.</P>
<P>The circle round you, the chiefs of his Majesty's European
forces, and of the Princes his allies, esteem you as brothers in the war;
emulous in glory and in friend∣ship, we will endeavour reciprocally to give
and to receive examples; we know how to value, and we will strive to imitate
your perseverance in enterprize, and your constancy to resist hunger,
weariness, and pain. Be it our task, from the dictates of 
<PB N="xiii" REF="159"/> our religion, the laws of our warefare, and the
principles and interest of our policy, to regulate your passions when
they overbear, to point out were it is nobler to spare than to revenge, to
discriminate degrees of guilt, to suspend the up-listed stroke, to
chastise, and not to destroy.</P>
<P>This war to you, my friends, is new; upon all former
occasions in taking the field you held yourselves authorized to destroy
wherever you came, because every where you found an enemy. The case is now
very different.</P>
<P>The King has many faithful subjects dispersed in the
provinces, consequently you have many brothers there; and these people are
the more to be pitied, that they are persecuted, or imprisoned, wherever
they are discovered, or suspected, and to di∣semble, is, to a generous
mind, a yet more grievous punishment.</P>
<P>Persuaded that your magnanimity of character, joined to your
principles of affec∣tion to the King, will give me fuller controul over your
minds, than the military rank with which I am invested, I enjoin your most
serious attention to the rules which I hereby proclaim for your invariable
observation during the campaign.</P>
<P>I positively forbid bloodshed, when you are not opposed
in arms.</P>
<P>Aged men, women, children, and prisoners, must be held
sacred from the knife or hatchet, even in the time of actual conflict.</P>
<P>You shall receive compensation for the prisoners you
take, but you shall be called to account for scalps.</P>
<P>In conformity and indulgence to your customs, which have
affixed an idea of ho∣nour to such badges of victory, you shall be allowed
to take the scalps of the dead, when killed by your fire, and in fair
opposition; but on no account, or pretence, or subtlety, or prevarication,
are they to be taken from the wounded, or even dying; and still less
pardonable, if possible, will it be held, to kill men in that condition, on
purpose, and upon a supposition, that this protection to the wounded,
would be thereby evaded.</P>
<P>Base lurking assassins, incendiaries, ravagers, and
plunderers of the country, to whatever army they may belong, shall be treated
with less reserve; but the latitude must be given you by order, and I
must be the judge of the occasion.</P>
<P>Should the enemy, on their part, dare to countenance acts of
barbarity towards those who may fall into their hands, it shall be yours
also to retaliate; but till severity shall be thus compelled, bear
immoveable in your hearts this solid maxim, it cannot be too deeply
impressed, that the great essential reward, worthy service of your
alli∣ance, the sincerity of your zeal to the King your father, and
never-failing protector, will be examined, and judged upon the test only of
your steady and uniform adhe∣rence to the orders and counsels of those to
whom his Majesty has intrusted the direc∣tion and the honour of his
arms.</P>

<P>Having remained at Crown-Point three days to bring up
the rear of the army, to establish the magazines and the hospital, and to
obtain intelligence of the enemy, on the</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">30th June.</NOTE>I ordered the
advanced corps, consisting of the British light infantry and grenadiers,
the 24th regiment, some Canadians and Savages, and ten pieces of light
artillery, under the command of Brigadier General Fraser, to move from Putnam
Creek, where they had been encamped some days, up the west shore of the
lake to Four-Mile-Point, so called from being within that distance off the
fort of Ticoderoga. The German reserve, consisting of the Brunswick
chasseurs, light infantry and gre∣nadiers under Lieutenant Colonel Breyman
were moved at the same time to Richard∣son's farm, on the east shore,
opposite to Putnam Creek.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">1st July.</NOTE>The whole army made
a movement forward. Brigadier Fraser's corps occupied the strong post
called Three-Mile-Point, on the west shore; the German reserve the
east-shore opposite: the army encamped in two lines, the right wing at
the Four-Mile-Point, the left wing nearly opposite, on the east
shore.</P>
<P>The Royal George, and Inflexible frigates, with the
gun-boats, were anchored at this time just without the reach of the enemy's
batteries, and covered the lake from the west to the east shores. The
rest of the fleet had been some time without guns, in order to assist
in carrying provisions over Lake Champlain.</P>
<P>The enemy appeared to be posted as follows. A brigade
occupied the old French lines on the height to the north of the fort of
Ticonderoga. These lines were in good repair, and had several intrenchments
behind them, chiefly calculated to guard the north-west flank, and were
further sustained by a block-house. They had, farther to 
<PB N="xv" REF="161"/> their left, a post at the saw-mills, which are at the
foot of the carrying-place to Lake George, and a block-house upon an eminence
above the mills, and a block-house and hospital at the entrance of the
lake.</P>
<P>Upon the right of the lines, and between them and the
old fort, there were two new block-houses and a considerable battery
close to the water edge.</P>
<P>It seemed that the enemy had employed their chief
industry, and were in the grea∣test force upon Mount Independence, which is
high and circular, and upon the sum∣mit, which is Table Land, was a star
fort, made of pickets, and well supplied with artillery, and a large square
of barracks within it. The foot of the hill, on the side which projects into
the lake, was intrenched and had a strong abbattis close to the water. This
intrenchment was lined with heavy artillery, pointed down the lake flanking the
water battery, above described, and sustained by another battery about
half way up the hill. On the west side the hill runs the main river, and in
its passage is joined by the water which comes down from Lake George. The
enemy had here a bridge of communication, which could not at this time be
reconnoitred. On the east side of the hill the water forms a small bay,
into which falls a rivulet after having encirculed in its course part of the
hill to the south east. The side to the south could not be seen, but
was described as inaccessible.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">July 2.</NOTE>About nine in the
morning a smoke was observed towards Lake George, and the Savages brought
in a report that the enemy had set fire to the further block-house and had
abandoned the saw-mills, and that a considerable body were advancing from
the lines towards a bridge upon the road which led from the saw-mills towards
the right of the British camp. A detachment of the advanced corps was
immediately put in march, under the command of Brigadier Fraser, supported
by the second brigade and some light artillery, under the command of Major
General Phillips, with orders to proceed to Mount Hope, which is to the north
of the lines, to reconnoitre the enemy's position, and to take advantage of
any post they might abandon or be driven from. The Indians under Captain
Fraser, supported by his company of marksmen, were directed to make a
circuit to the left of Brigadier Fraser's line of march, and endea∣vour to
cut off the retreat of the enemy to their lines; but this design miscarried
through the impetuosity of the Indians, who attacked too soon, and in
front; and the enemy were thereby able to retire with the loss of one officer
and a few men killed, and one officer wounded. Major General Phillips took
possession of the very advanta∣geous post of Mount Hope this night,
and the enemy were thereby entirely cut off from all communication with Lake
George.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">July 3.</NOTE>Mount Hope was occupied
in force by General Fraser's whole corps. The first British brigade, and
two entire brigades of artillery. The second brigade, British, encamped
upon the left of the first, and the brigade of Gall, having been drawn from
the east shore to occupy the ground where Fraser's corps had originally
been; the line became compleat, extending from Three-Mile-Point to the
westermost part of Mount Hope; on the same day, Major General Reidesel
encamped on the east shore in a parallel line with Three-Mile-Point, having
pushed the reserve forward near the rivulet which encircles Mount
Independence. The enemy cannonaded the camps of Mount Hope and of the German
reserve during most part of this day, but without effect.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">July 4.</NOTE>The army worked hard at
their communications and got up the artillery, tents, baggage and provisions,
the enemy at intervals continued the cannonade upon the camps, which was not in
any instance returned.</P>
<P><PB N="xvi" REF="162"/> The Thunderer Radeau, carrying
the battering train and stores, having been warped up from Crown Point,
arrived this day, and immediately began to land the artillery.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">5th July.</NOTE>Lieutenant Twiss,
the commanding engineer, was ordered to reconnoitre Sugar Hill, on the south
side of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ommunion from Lake
George into Lake Champlain, which had been possessed in the night by a
party of light infantry. It appeared at first to be a very advantageous
post, and it is now known that the enemy had a coun∣cil some time ago upon
the expediency of possessing it; but the idea was rejected, upon the
supposition that it was impossible for a corps to be established
there in force. Lieutenant Twiss reported this hill to have the entire
command of the works and buildings both of Ticonderoga and Mount Independence,
at the d stance of about 1400 yards from the former, and 1500 from the
latter; that the ground might be levelled so as to receive cannon, and that
the road to convey them, though difficult, might be made practicable in
twenty-four hours. This hill also commanded, in reverse, the bridge of
communication; saw the exact situ∣ation of their vessels; nor could the
enemy, during the day, make any material movement or preparation, without being
discovered, and even having their num∣bers counted,</P>
<P>It was determined that a battery should be raised on
Sugar Hill for light twenty∣four pounders, medium twelves, and eight-inch
howitzers. This very arduous work was carried on so rapidly that the battery
would have been ready the next day.</P>
<P>It is a duty in this place to do some justice to the
zeal and activity of Major General Phillips, who had the direction of the
operation, and having mentioned that most valuable officer, I trust it
cannot be thought a digression to add, that it is to his judicious
arrangements and indefatigable pains, during the general super∣intendency of
preparation which Sir Guy Carleton entrusted to him in the winter and
spring, that the service is indebted for its present forwardness. The
preva∣lence of contrary winds and other accidents having rendered it
impossible for any necessaries prepared in England for the opening of
the campaign, yet to reach the camp.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">6th July.</NOTE>Soon after day-light
an officer arrived express, on board the Royal George, where in the night I
took up my quarters, as the most centrical situation, with information from
Brigadier Fraser that the enemy were retiring, and that he was advancing with
his picquets, leaving orders for the brigade to follow as soon as they could
accoutre, with intention to pursue by land. This movement was very
discernible, as were the British colours, which the Brigadier had fixed
upon the fort of Ticonderoga. Knowing how safely I could trust to that
officer's conduct. I turned my chief attention to the pursuit by water, by
which route I understood one column were retiring in two hundred and twenty
bateaux, covered by five armed gallies.</P>
<P>The great bridge of communication, through which a way
was to be opened, was supported by twenty-two sunken piers of large timber,
at nearly equal di∣stances; the space between were made of separate
floats, each about fifty feet long, and twelve feet wide, strongly fastened
together by chains and rivets, and also fastened to the sunken piers.
Before this bridge was a boom, made of very <PB N="xvii" REF="163"/> large
pieces of timber, fastened together by rivetted bolts and double chains, made
of iron an inch and an half square.</P>
<P>The gun-boats were instantly moved forward, and the
boom and one of the intermediate floats were cut with great dexterity and
dispatch, and Commodore Lutwidge, with the officers and seamen in his
department, partaking the general animation, a passage was formed in half
an hour for the frigates also, through im∣pediments which the enemy had been
labouring to construct since last autumn.</P>
<P>During this operation Major General Reidesel had
passed to Mount Indepen∣dence, with the corps, Breyman, and part of the
left wing. He was directed to proceed by land, to sustain Brigadier
Fraser, or to act more to the left, if he saw it expedient so to do.</P>
<P>The 62d regiment British, and the Brunswick regiment
of Prince Frederick, were stationed at Ticonderoga and Mount Independence, in
the place of the parties of Fraser's brigade, which had been left in
possession of the artillery and stores, and the rest of the army
was ordered to follow up the river as they could be col∣lected, without regard
to the place in the line.</P>
<P>About three in the afternoon I arrived with the Royal
George and Inflexible; and the best sailing gun-boats at South Bay, within
three miles of Skenesborough, at which latter place the enemy were posted
in a stockaded fort, and their armed gallies in the falls below.</P>
<P>The foremost regiments, viz. the 9th, 20th, and
21st, were immediately dis∣embarked, and ascended the mountains with the
intention of getting behind the fort, and cutting off the retreat of the enemy;
but their precipitate flight rendered this manoeuvre ineffectual. The gun-boats
and frigates continued their course to Skenesborough Falls, where the armed
vessels were posted. Captain Carter, with part of his brigade of
gun-boats, immediately attacked, and with so much spirit, that two of the
vessels very soon struck; the other three were blown up, and the enemy
having previously prepared combustible materials, set fire to the fort,
mills, storehouses, bateaux, &amp;c. and retired with the detachment left
for that purpose, the main body having gone off when the troops were
ascending the mountain. A great quantity of provisions and some arms were
here consumed, and most of their officers' baggage was burnt, sunk, or
taken. Their loss is not known; about 30 prisoners were made, among which
were two wounded officers.</P>
<P>During these operations upon the right, Brigadier
General Fraser continued his pursuit to Castletown till one o'clock,
having marched in a very hot day from four o'clock in the morning till that
time. Some stragglers of the enemy were picked up, from whom the Brigadier
learned that their rear guard was composed of chosen men, and commanded by
Colonel Francis, one of their best officers. During the time that the men
were refreshing, Major General Reidesel came up, and arrange∣ments for
continuing the pursuit having been concerted, Brigadier Fraser moved
forward again, and during the night lay upon his arms, in an advantageous
situ∣ation, three miles nearer the enemy.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">7th July.</NOTE>At three in the
morning he renewed his march, and about five his advanced scouts discovered
the enemy's centries, who fired their pieces and joined the main body. The
Brigadier observing a commanding ground to the left of his light infantry,
immediately ordered it to be possessed by that corps; and a
considerable body of the enemy attempting the same, they met. The enemy
were driven back <PB N="xviii" REF="164"/> to their original post; the
advanced guard under Major Grant was by this time engaged, and the grenadiers
were advanced to sustain them, and to prevent the right flank from being
turned. The Brigadier remained on the left, where the enemy long defended
themselves by the aid of logs and trees, and after being repulsed, and
prevented getting to the Castletown road by the grenadiers, they rallied, and
renewed the action; and upon a second repulse, attempted their retreat by
Pitsford Mountain. The grenadiers scrambled up a part of that ascent,
appearing almost inaccessible, and gained the summit before them, which
threw them into confusion; they were still greatly superior in numbers,
and consequently in extent, and the brigadier, in momentary expectation of
the Brunswickers, had latterally drawn from his left to support his right.
At this critical moment General Reidesel, who had pressed on, upon
hearing the firing, arrived with the foremost of his columns, viz. the
chasseurs company and eighty grenadiers and light infantry. His judgment
immediately pointed to him the course to take; he extended upon Brigadier
Fraser's left flank. The chasseurs got into action with great gallantry,
under Major Barner. They fled on all sides, leaving dead upon the field
Colonel Francis and many other officers, with upwards of 200 men; above 600
were wounded, most of whom perished in the woods, attempting to get off,
and one colonel, seven captains, ten subalterns, and 210 men were made
prisoners; above 200 stand of arms were also taken.</P>
<P>The number of the enemy before the engagement amounted
to 2000 men. The British detachment under Brigadier General Fraser (the
parties left the day before at Ticonderoga not having been able to join)
consisted only of 850 fighting men.</P>
<P>The bare relation of so signal an action is
sufficient for its praise. Should the attack against such inequality of
numbers, before the German brigade came up, seem to require explanation, it
is to be considered that the enemy might have escaped by delay; that the
advanced guard on a sudden found themselves too near the enemy to avoid
action without retreating; and that Brigadier Fraser had supposed the
German troops to be very near. The difference of time in their arrival was
merely accidental. The Germans pushed for a share in the glory, and they
arrived in time to obtain it. I have only to add, that the exertions of
Briga∣dier Fraser on this day were but a continuance of that uniform
intelligence, activity and bravery, which distinguish his character upon
all occasions, and entitle him to be recommended, in the most particular
manner, to his Majesty's favour.</P>
<P>The officers and soldiers of this brigade have
prevented any distinctions of indi∣viduals by a general and equal display
of spirit.</P>
<P>The country people about Skenesborough having reported
that part of the enemy were still retreating, the 9th regiment was detached,
with orders to take post near Fort Anne, and observe the enemy's motions.
This was effected, but with great difficulty, as the roads were almost
impracticable, and the bridges broken. The other troops were employed all that
day and night in dragging fifty bateaux over the carrying place at Wood Creek,
to facilitate the movement of the rest of the first brigade to Fort Anne,
to dislodge the enemy.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">8th July.</NOTE>A report was received
from Lieutenant Colonel Hill (9th regiment) that the enemy had been reinforced
in the night by a considerable body of fresh men; that he could not retire
with his regiment before them, but he would maintain his ground. The two
remaining regiments of the first brigade were ordered to quicken 
<PB N="xix" REF="165"/> their march, and upon second intelligence of the
enemy, and firing being heard, the 20th regiment was ordered forward with two
pieces of artillery, and Major General Phillips was sent to take the command.
A violent storm of rain, which lasted the whole day, prevented the troops
from getting to Fort Anne so soon as was intended; but the delay gave the
9th regiment an opportunity of distinguish∣ing themselves, by standing
and repulsing an attack of six times their number. The enemy finding the
position not to be forced in front, endeavoured to turn it; and from the
superiority of their numbers that inconvenience was to be appre∣hended; and
Lieutenant Colonel Hill found it necessary to change his position in the
height of action: so critical an order was executed by the regiment with the
utmost steadiness and bravery. The enemy, after an attack of three hours,
were totally repulsed, and fled towards Fort Edward, setting fire to Fort
Anne, but leaving a saw-mill and a block-house in good repair, which were
afterwards pos∣sessed by the king's troops.</P>
<P>The 9th regiment acquired, during their expedition,
about thirty prisoners, some stores and baggage, and colours of the 2d
Hampshire regiment.</P>
<P>One unlucky accident happened, to counterbalance, in
some degree, this suc∣cess. Captain Montgomery, an officer of great
merit, was wounded early in the action, and was in the act of being dressed
by the surgeon when the regiment changed ground; being unable to help
himself, he and the surgeon were taken prisoners. I since hear he has
been well treated, and is in a fair way of recovery at Albany.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">9th and 10th July.</NOTE>The army
very much fatigued (many parts of it having wanted their provisions for two
days, almost the whole their tents and baggage) assembled in their
present position. The right wing occupies the heights of Skenesborough in
two lines; the right flank to the mountains, covered by the regiment of
Reidesel's dragoons, <HI>en potence;</HI> the left to the Wood Creek.</P>
<P>The Brunswick troops under Major General Reidesel
upon Castletown River, with Breyman's corps upon the communication of roads
leading to Putney and Rutland; the regiment of Hesse Hanau are posted at
the head of East Creek, to preserve the communication with the camp at
Castletown River, and secure the bateaux.</P>
<P>Brigadier Fraser's corps is in the centre, ready to
move on either wing of the army.</P>
<P>The scattered remains of the enemy are at Fort Edward,
on the Hudson's River, where they have been joined, as I am informed, by
General Putnam, with a considerable corps of fresh troops.</P>
<P>Roads are opening for the army to march to them by Fort
Anne, and the Wood Creek is clearing of fallen trees, sunken stones, and
other obstacles, to give passage to bateaux for carrying artillery,
stores, provisions and camp equipage. These are laborious works; but the
spirit and zeal of the troops are sufficient to surmount them. Some
little time must also be allowed for the supplies of provisions to
overtake us. In the mean time all possible diligence is using at
Ticonderoga to get the gun-boats, provision vessels, and a proper
quantity of bateaux into Lake George. A corps of the army will be ordered to
penetrate by that route, which will afterwards be the route for the magazines;
and a junction of the whole is in∣tended at Fort Edward.</P>

<LETTER>
<HEADNOTE>
<P>[Private.]</P>
</HEADNOTE>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HAVING given your Lordship a detail, in my public letter of
this date, of the late transactions, I now do myself the honour to state
to your Lordship, such circum∣stances as appear to me more proper for a
private communication.</P>
<P>Mr. Peters and Mr. Jessup, who came over to Canada last
autumn, and proposed to raise battalions, one from the neighbourhood of
Albany, the other from Charlotte county, are confident of success as the
army advances. Their battalions are now in embryo, but very promising; they
have fought, and with spirit. Sir Guy Carleton has given me blank
commissions for the officers, to fill up occasionally, and the agree∣ment
with them is, that the commissions are not to be so effective, till two
thirds of the battalions are raised. Some hundreds of men, a third part of
them with arms, have joined me since I have penerated this place,
professing themselves loyalists, and wishing to serve, some to
the end of the war, some for the campaign. Though I am without instructions
upon this subject, I have not hesitated to receive them, and as fast as
companies can be formed, I shall post the officers till a decision can be
made upon the measure by my superiors. I mean to employ them particularly
upon detach∣ments, for keeping the country in awe, and procuring cattle; their
real use I expect will be great in the preservation of the national troops:
but the impression which will be caused upon public opinion, should
provincials be seen acting vigorously in the cause of the King, will be
yet more advantageous, and, I trust, fully justify the ex∣pence.</P>
<P>The manifesto, of which I enclosed your Lordship a copy
in my last dispatches, and herewith send a duplicate, has great effect
where the country is not in the power of the rebels; where it is, the
committees turn all their efforts to counteract it. They watch or imprison
all suspected persons, compel the people in general to take arms, and to
drive the cattle, and to burn the corn, under penalty of immediate death. Great
numbers have been hanged. Should these wretches succeed to make a desert
of the country, by fire and massacre, it will at least be a pleasing
reflection, that while advantages are reaped from the clement part of the
manifesto, they, and not the King's troops, are the executioners of its
threats.</P>
<P>Your Lordship will have observed, I have made no mention
of the Indians, in the pursuit from Ticonderoga. It is not possible to
draw them in many respects from the plunder of that place, and I
confidentially acknowledge this is not the only instance in which I have
found little more than a name. If, under the management of their conductors,
they are indulged, for interested reasons, in all the caprices and humours
of spoiled children, like them they grow more unreasonable and importunate
upon <PB N="xxi" REF="167"/> every new favour; were they left to themselves,
enormities too horrid to think of would ensue, guilty and innocent, women and
infants, would be a common prey.</P>
<P>This is the character of the lower Canadian Indians, who alone
have been with the army hitherto. I am informed the Outawas, and other remote
nations, who are within two days march of joining me, are more brave and more
tractable; that they profess war, not pillage. They are under the directions
of a M. St. Luc, a Canadian gentleman of honour and parts, and one of the
best partizans the French had last war, and of one Langlade, the very man
who projected and executed with these very na∣tions the defeat of General
Braddock. My first intention was to turn this whole corps to the Connecticut
immediately, to force a supply of provisions, to intercept reinforcements,
and to confirm the jealousy I have in many ways endeavoured to ex∣cite in the
New England provinces; but finding that the enemy are labouring to re∣move
their magazines from Forts George and Edward, and every where destroying the
roads, and preparing to drive and burn the country towards Albany, I have
de∣termined to employ them, to prevent, if possible, by their terror, the
continuance of those operations. And after arriving at Albany, they may be
employed to renew the alarm towards Connecticut and Boston.</P>
<P>Your Lordship will pardon me if I a little lament that my
orders do not give me the latitude I ventured to propose in my original
project for the campaign, to make a real effort instead of a feint upon New
England. As things have turned out, were I at liberty to march in force
immediately by my left, instead of my right, I should have little doubt of
subduing before winter the provinces where the rebellion origi∣ginated.</P>
<P>If my late letters reach Mr. Howe, I still hope this plan
may be adopted from Al∣bany; in the mean while my utmost exertions shall
continue, according to my in∣structions, to force a junction.</P>
<P>I have sent some Indians through the woods, in the hope of
their reaching St. Leger, with the account of my progress; now is the
critical time for his push upon the Mohawk. I have certain intelligence that
all the country round Fort Stanwix is in alarm: but I imagine it proceeds from
the appearance of some Savages detached by Colonel Butler, not apprehending
St. Leger can be got quite so forward.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE> Camp near Saratoga, 
<DATE>August 20, 1777.</DATE></DATELINE> 
<SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN my last dispatch (a duplicate of which will be
inclosed herewith) I had the honour to inform your Lordship of the
proceedings of the army under my command to the 30th of July.</P>
<P>From that period to the 15th of August every possible
measure was employed to bring forward bateaux, provisions, and ammunition
from Fort George to the first navigable part of Hudson's River, a
distance of eighteen miles, the roads in some parts steep, and in others
wanting great repair. Of the horses furnished by contra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t in Canada not more than a third part
was yet arrived. The delay was not imputable <PB N="xxii" REF="168"/> to
neglect, but to the natural accidents attending so long and intricate a
combination of land and water carriage. Fifty team of oxen, which had been
collected in the country through which I had marched, were added to
assist the transport; but these resources together were found far
inadequate to the purposes of feeding the army, and forming a magazine at the
same time. Exceeding heavy rains augmented the impediments. It was often
necessary to employ ten or twelve oxen upon a single bateau; and after
the utmost exertions for the fifteen days above stated, there were not
above four days provision before hand, nor above ten bateaux in the
river.</P>
<P>Intelligence had reached me that Lieutenant Colonel St. Leger
was before Fort Stanwix, which was defended. The main army of the enemy
opposed to me was at Stillwater, a place between Saratoga and the mouth of
the Mohawk.</P>
<P>A rapid movement forward appeared to be of the utmost
consequence at this period. The enemy could not have proceeded up the Mohawk
without putting themselves between two fires, in case Colonel St. Leger
should have succeeded; and at best being cut off by my army from Albany.
They must either therefore have stood an action, have fallen back towards
Albany, or have passed the Hudson's River, in order to secure a retreat
to New England, higher up. Which ever of these measures they had taken,
so that the King's army had been enabled to advance, Colo∣nel St. Leger's
operations would have been assisted, a junction with him probably
secured, and the whole country of the Mohawk opened. To maintain the
commu∣nication with Fort George during such a movement, so as to be
supplied by daily degrees at a distance, continually increasing, was an
obvious impossibility. The army was much too weak to have afforded a chain
of posts. Escorts for every sepa∣rate transport would have been a
still greater drain; nor could any have been made so strong as to force
their way through such positions as the enemy might take in one night's
march from the White Creek, where they had a numerous militia. Had the enemy
remained supine, through fear or want of comprehending so palpable an
ad∣vantage, the physical impossibility of being supplied by degrees
from Fort George was still in force, because a new necessity of land
carriage for nine miles arises at Still∣water; and in the proportion that
carriages had been brought forward to that place, the transport must have
ceased behind.</P>
<P>The alternative therefore was short; either to relinquish
the favourable opportuni∣ty of advancing upon the enemy, or to attempt other
resources of supply.</P>
<P>It was well known that the enemy's supplies in live cattle,
from a large tract of country, passed by the route of Manchester,
Arlington, and other parts of the Hampshire Grants, to Bennington, in order
to be occasionally conveyed from thence to the main army. A large deposit
of corn and of wheel carriages was also formed at the same place, and the
usual guard was militia, though it varied in numbers from day to day. A
scheme was formed to surprise Bennington. The possession of the
cattle and carriages would certainly have enabled the army to leave their
distant ma∣gazines, and to have acted with energy and dispatch: success
would also have answer∣ed many secondary purposes.</P>
<P>Lieut. Col. Baume, an officer well qualified for the
undertaking, was fixed upon to command. He had under him 200 dismounted
dragoons of the regiment of Riede∣sel, Captain Fraser's marksmen, which
were the only British, all the Canadian volun∣teers, a party of the
Provincials who perfectly knew the country, 100 Indians, and two light pieces
of cannon; the whole detachment amounted to abo ut 500 men. The instructions
were positive to keep the regular corps posted while thel ight troops felt 
<PB N="xxiii" REF="169"/> their way, and not to incur the danger of being
surrounded, or having a retreat cut off.</P>
<P>In order to facilitate this operation, and to be ready to take
advantage of its suc∣cess, the army moved up the east shore of
Hudson's River. On the 14th, a bridge was formed of rafts, over which the
advanced corps passed and encamped at Saratoga. Lieutenant Colonel
Breyman's corps were posted near Batten Kill, and upon intelli∣gence from
Colonel Baume, that the enemy were stronger at Bennington than ex∣pected, and
were aware of his attack, that corps, consisting of the Brunswick
gre∣nadiers, light infantry and chasseurs, were sent forward to
sustain him.</P>
<P>It since appears that Lieutenant Colonel Baume, not having
been able to complete his march undiscovered, was joined at a place called
Sancoix Mills, about four miles short of Bennington, by many people
professing themselves to be Loyalists. A pro∣vincial gentleman of
confidence who had been sent with the detachment, as knowing the country and
the character of the inhabitants, was so incautious as to leave at liber∣ty
such as took the oath of allegiance.</P>
<P>His credulity and their profligacy caused the first
misfortune. Colonel Baume was induced to proceed without sufficient knowledge
of the ground. His design was be∣trayed; the men who had taken the oaths were
the first to fire upon him; he was attacked on all sides. He shewed great
personal courage, but was overpowered by numbers.</P>
<P>During this time Lieutenant Colonel Breyman was upon the march
through a hea∣vy rain; and such were the other impediments stated in that
officer's report, of bad roads, tired horses, difficulties in passing
artillery, carriages, &amp;c. that he was from eight in the morning of the 15th
to four in the afternoon of the following day making about twenty-four
miles.</P>
<P>He engaged, fought gallantly, and drove the enemy from three
several heights; but was too late to succour Colonel Baume, who was made
prisoner, and a considera∣ble part of his dragoons were killed or taken.
The failure of ammunition, from the accidental breaking to pieces of a tumbril,
unfortunately obliged Lieutenant Colonel Breyman to retire conquering troops,
and to leave behind two pieces of cannon, be∣sides two which had been lost
by Lieutenant Colonel Baume. The Indians made good their retreat from the
first affair, as did Captain Fraser, with part of his compa∣ny, and many of
the Provincials and Canadians.</P>
<P>The loss, as at present appears, amounts to about 400 men,
killed and taken in both actions, and twenty-six officers, mostly
prisoners; but men who were dispersed in the woods drop in daily. A
correct return shall be transmitted to your Lordship the first
opportunity.</P>
<P>This, my Lord, is a true state of the event. I have not
dwelt upon errors, be∣cause in many instances they were counterbalanced by
spirit. The enemy will of course find matter of parade in the acquisition
of four pieces of cannon: but that apart, they have small cause of
exultation; their loss in killed and wounded being more than double to ours,
by the confession of their prisoners and deserters, and of many
inhabitants who were witnesses to the burial of their dead.</P>
<P>The chief subject of regret on our side, after that which
any loss of gallant men naturally occasions, is the disappointment of not
obtaining live cattle, and the loss of time in bringing forward the
magazines.</P>
<P><PB N="xxiv" REF="170"/> This heavy work is now nearly
completed, and a new bridge of boats is thrown over the Hudson's River,
opposite to Saratoga, the former one of rafts having been carried away by the
swell of water after the late continual rains. When enabled to move, nothing
within my scale of talent shall be left unattempted to fulfil his
Maje∣sty's orders, and I hope circumstances will be such, that my
endeavours may be in some degree assisted by a co-operation of the army
under Sir William Howe.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I NEED not enlarge upon the concern I have in communicating any
sinister events. I am persuaded your Lordship will give me credit for
partaking every sentiment that your Lordship, or any other man warmed with
principle and zeal in this contest, can feel.</P>
<P>In regard to the affair of Saintcoick, I have only to add to the
public account, that if ever there was a situation to justify enterprize
and exertion, out of the beaten track of military service, it was that in
which I found myself. Had I succeeded, I should have effected a junction
with St. Leger, and been now before Albany. And I flatter myself, I need only
mention those views, to shew that in hazarding this expedition I had the
soundest principles of military reasoning on my side, viz. that the
advantages to be expected from success were in a great degree superior to
the evils that could at∣tend miscarriage. The secondary purposes, to
which I alluded in the public letter, were to try the affections of the
country; to complete the Provincial corps, many re∣cruits for which were unable
to escape from their villages without a force to encou∣rage and protect them;
and to distract the councils of the enemy, by continuing their jealousy
towards New England.</P>
<P>Major General Reidesel has pressed upon me repeatedly the
mounting his dragoons, the men were animated with the same desire, and I
conceived it a most favourable oc∣casion to give into their ideas and
solicitations, because in exerting their zeal to fulfil their favourite
purpose, they necessarily would effect the greater purpose of my own.
The rest of the troops were selected from such as would least weaken
the solid strength of the army, in case of ill success; and I thought
it expedient to take a little trial of the Provincials and Canadians before I
might have occasion for them in more impor∣tant actions.</P>
<P>The original detachment could not have been made larger without
opening roads, and other preparations of time, nor should I have thought it
justifiable to expose the best troops to loss upon a collateral action.
Had my instructions been followed, or could Mr. Breyman have marked at the
rate of two miles an hour any given twelve hours out of the two and thirty,
success would probably have ensued, misfortune would certainly have been
avoided. I did not think it prudent, in the present crisis, to mark these
circumstances to the public so strongly as I do in confidence to your 
<PB N="xxv" REF="171"/> Lordship; but I rely, and I will venture to say I
expect, because I think justice will warrant the expectation, that while,
for the sake of public harmony, that necessary prin∣ciple for conducting
nice and laborious service, I colour the faults of the execution, your
Lordship will, in your goodness, be my advocate to the King, and to the
world, in vindication of the plan.</P>
<P>The consequences of this affair, my Lord, have little effect
upon the strength or spirits of the army; but the prospect of the
campaign in other respects, is far less prosperous than when I wrote
last. In spire of St. Leger's victory, Fort Stanwix holds out
obstinately. I am afraid the expectations of Sir J. Johnson greatly fail in
the rising of the country. On this side I find daily reason to doubt the
sincerity of the re∣solution of the professing loyalists. I have
about 400, but not half of them armed, who may be depended upon; the rest are
trimmers, merely actuated by interest. The great bulk of the country is
undoubtedly with the Congress, in principle and in zeal; and their measures
are executed with a secrecy and dispatch that are not to be equalled.
Wherever the King's forces point, militia, to the amount of three or four
thousand assemble in twenty-four hours; they bring with them their
subsistence, &amp;c. and, the alarm over, they return to their farms. The
Hampshire Grants in particular, a country unpeopled and almost unknown in
the last war, now abounds in the most active and most re∣bellious race of
the continent, and hangs like a gathering storm upon my left. In all parts
the industry and managment in driving cattle, and removing corn, are
indefati∣gable and certain; and it becomes impracticable to move without
portable maga∣zines. Another most embarrassing circumstance, is the
want of communication with Sir William Howe; of the messengers I have
sent, I know of two being hanged, and am ignorant whether any of the rest
arrived. The same fate has pro∣bably attended those dispatched by Sir
William Howe; for only one letter is come to hand, informing me that his
intention is for Pensylvania; that Washington has de∣tached Sullivan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> with 2500 men to Albany; that Putnam is
in the Highlands, with 4000 men. That after my arrival at Albany, the movements
of the enemy must guide mine; but that he wished the enemy might be driven
out of the province be∣fore any operation took place against the Connecticut;
that Sir Henry Clinton remain∣ed in the command in the neighbourhood of
New-York, and would act as occurrences might direct.</P>
<P>No operation, my Lord, has yet been undertaken in my favour: the
highlands have not even been threatened. The consequence is, that Putnam has
detached two brigades to Mr. Gates, who is now strongly posted near the
mouth of the Mohawk-River, with an army superior to mine in troops of the
Congress, and as many militia as he pleases. He is likewise far from
being deficient in artillery, having received all the pieces that were landed
from the French ships which got into Boston.</P>
<P>Had I a latitude in my orders, I should think it my duty to
wait in this position, or perhaps as far back as Fort Edward, where my
communication with Lake George would be perfectly secure, till some event
happened to assist my movement forward; but my orders being positive to

<Q REND="inline">"force a junction with Sir William Howe,"</Q> I
appre∣hend I am not at liberty to remain inactive longer than shall be
necessary to collect twenty-five days provision, and to receive the
reinforcement of the additional com∣panies, the German drafts and recruits now
(and unfortunately only now) on Lake Champlain. The waiting the arrival of this
reinforcement is of indispensible necessity, because from the hour I
pass the Hudson's River and proceed towards Albany, all 
<PB N="xxvi" REF="172"/> safety of communication ceases. I must expect a
large body of the enemy from my left will take post behind me. I have put out
of the question the waiting longer than the time necessary for the
foregoing purposes, because the attempt, then critical, de∣pending on
adventure and the fortune that often accompanies it, and hardly justifiable
but by orders from the state, would afterwards be consummately desperate.
I mean my Lord, that by moving soon, though I should meet with
insurmountable difficul∣ties to my progress, I shall at least have the
chance of fighting my way back to Ticon∣deroga, but the season a little
further advanced, the distance encreased, and the march unavoidably tardy,
because surrounded by enemies, a retreat might be shut by im∣penetrable
bars or the elements, and at the same time no possible means of
existence remain in the country.</P>
<P>When I wrote more confidently, I little foresaw that I was to
be left to pursue my way through such a tract of country, and hosts of
foes, without any co-operation from New-York; nor did I then think the
garrison of Ticonderoga would fall to my share alone, a dangerous
experiment would it be to leave that post in weakness, and too heavy a
drain it is upon the life-blood of my force to give it due strength.</P>
<P>I yet do not despond.—Should I succeed in forcing my
way to Albany, and find that country in a state to subsist my army, I
shall think no more of a retreat, but at the worst fortify there and await
Sir W. Howe's operations.</P>
<P>Whatever may be my fate, my Lord, I submit my actions to the
breast of the King, and to the candid judgment of my profession, when all
the motives become public; and I rest in the confidence, that whatever
decision may be passed upon my conduct, my good intent will not be
questioned.</P>
<P>I cannot close so serious a letter without expressing
my fullest satisfaction in the be∣haviour and countenance of the troops,
and my compleat confidence that in all trials they will do whatever can be
expected from men devoted to their King and country.</P>

<P>P. S. Upon re-perusing this letter, I am apprehensive that
the manner in which I have expressed myself, respecting the
reinforcement being only upon Lake Cham∣plain, may seem ambiguous.—I do
not mean to impute the delay to any thing but accidents, nor do I mean to
contest Sir Guy Carleton's reasoning upon not complying with my
requisitions to garrison Ticonderoga, I only lament it.</P>

<P>I have received yours of the second instant on the 15th,

Ticonderoga, <HI>which is a great event, carried without loss.</HI> I have
received your two letters, <HI>viz.</HI> from Plymouth and Quebec, your last
of the 14th May, and shall observe the contents. There is a report of a
messenger of yours to me having been taken, and the letter discovered in
a double wooden canteen, you will know if it was of any consequence; nothing
of it has tran∣spired to us. I will observe the <HI>same rules</HI> in
writing to you, as you propose, in your <PB N="xxvii" REF="173"/> letters to
me. Washington is waiting our motions here, and has detached Sullivan with
about 2500 men, as I learn, to Albany. My intention is for Pensylvania, where
I expect to meet Washington, but if he goes to the northward contrary to my
expectations, and you can keep him at bay, be assured I shall soon be
after him to relieve you.</P>
<P>After your arrival at Albany, the movements of the enemy will
guide yours; but my wishes are, that the enemy be drove out of this province
before any operation takes place in Connecticut. Sir Henry Clinton remains in
the command here, and will act as occurences my direct. Putnam is in the

<P>I received your letter of the 20th of October, with your
public dispatches by Captain Craig, the 5th instant, and heartily condole
with you upon the very disa∣greeable accounts they contain, all which I
sincerely lamented, both on the public account and your own.</P>
<P>This unfortunate event, it is to be hoped, will in future
prevent ministers from pretending to direct operations of war, in a country
at three thousand miles di∣stance, of which they have so little knowledge
as not to be able to distinguish between good, bad, or interested
advices, or to give positive orders in matters, which from their nature, are
ever upon the change; so that the expedience or propriety of a mea∣sure at
one moment, may be totally inexpedient or improper in the next.</P>
<P>Having given over all hopes of being relieved this fall. I
determined upon sending home Captain Foy, to furnish his Majesty's
confidential servants, and my successor, with the best information in
my power, of the state of affairs in this province, that they may form the

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I TAKE the liberty of informing your Excellency, that there has
yet been no arrange∣ment made for marching the field artillery by land,
should the corps of troops upon an expedition under your command in the
course of the campaign quit the lakes Champlain and George, and the
rivers.</P>
<P>I have, upon the strictest information which could be
procured, reason to believe, that neither carriages nor horses will be to
be had nearer than Albany, should the route of your army be that way, and
even in that country, it will necessarily require a con∣siderable time
before any can be got; all which must necessarily delay the operations of
the campaign, after the reduction of Ticonderoga. I therefore submit to your
Excellency's consideration whether horses and such ammunition-carriages
as may be wanted should not be procured for the service of the campaign,
for the field artillery attached to the corps of troops your Excellency is to
command this campaign?</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>Montreal,

<P>I HAVE the honour of your Excellency's letter to me of
yesterday, in answer to one I wrote on the subject of the field-artillery
being supplied with horses, &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>You are pleased, Sir, to order me to give an opinion upon
the mode of procuring horses and carriages from this country, combining the
consideration of dispatch, sufficiency, and oeconomy towards
government.</P>
<P>There are but two modes of procuring horses for the
service, supposing the country is not to furnish them upon
Corvées, the one is by purchasing of horses upon the account of
government, the other by contract.</P>
<P>The first of these modes has always appeared to me
difficult, uncertain, and full of openings for every species of imposition,
and the expence uncertain.—Government must trust various people to
buy horses, and in this country it will not be possible to procure any
persons who will not immediately pursue the views of gaining money to
themselves with a consideration for the King's service. Add to this, that
it will be∣come such a charge, that many commissaries must be
appointed, and various other officers of that sort, &amp;c, which being a
mixture of inspectors into the purchases of horses, and necessarily
also at times the being purchasers, it will be difficult ever to
ascertain the price, and seldom that the goodness of horses can be
depended on.</P>
<P>I have seen in my service this mode attempted, but it has
to my knowledge failed. I must allow, that could it be carried into execution
complete, it would be the cheapest for government: but taking into
consideration the various impositions which will arise, and that the
setting out on a plan of this nature will require a very large sum of
mo∣ney, <PB N="xxx" REF="176"/> perhaps from 20,000l. to 30,000l. to be
intrusted into various hands, I freely give it as my opinion that it is not a
perfect plan. The contracting for a certain num∣ber of horses at a fixed
price for the hire by day reduces the whole to a very simple, and therefore
generally a certain plan. It depends in the setting out, by making as cheap,
as fair, and just a bargain on the part of government as can be. And being
so made, that the military and civil officers do their duty, by attending to
the receiving of horses only as they are fitting for service. The
contractor has his interest so di∣rectly connected with fulfilling his
contract, as upon failure it ceases, that he will exert all means to do it,
and the care of government will be that it be done honestly and
compleatly.</P>
<P>I have thus obeyed your Excellency's orders, and given an
opinion which I submit entirely to your consideration.</P>
</LETTER>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>Extract of a Letter to <HI>Nathaniel Day,</HI> Esq.
Commissary General, &amp;c. dated <HI>Montreal,</HI> June 4th, 1777.</HEAD>
<P>I BEG the favour of you to calculate what number of horses
and carriages (suppo∣sing them such as are in common use in Canada)
will be sufficient for conveying by land thirty days provision for 10,000
men, together with about 1000 gallons of rum, and you will please to make me
your report as soon as possible.</P>

<HEAD>Extract of a Letter to Sir <HI>Guy Carleton.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Montreal, 
<DATE>June 7, 1777.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>HAVING had the honor to represent to your Excellency the
necessity of being provided with a certain number of horses and carriages
for the artillery, victual, and other indispensible purposes of the army,
when it shall be obliged to quit the borders of the lakes and rivers; and
having understood from your Excellency that such pro∣vision could not be
made by the ordinary methods of covée, and that if proposed without
compulsion upon the country the effect would be precarious, dilatory, and
expensive; I have the honour now to lay before your Excellency proposals
for con∣tracts for an expeditious supply of horses for the artillery, and
500 carts, with two horses each, for the other purposes.</P>
<P>I am too ignorant of the prices of the country to offer any
judgment upon the reasonableness of these proposals; nor have I any
long acquaintance with Mr. Jordan, or other motive for wishing him the
preference, if other persons can be found equally capable, responsible,
and expeditious. I have only thus far interfered, upon a con∣viction, after
considering the route the King's orders direct, and taking all possible
methods of information upon the supply to be expected as we proceed, that to
de∣pend upon the country altogether would be to hazard the expedition.</P>
<P>Your Excellency will observe, that in order to save the
public expence as much as possible, I have reduced this requisition much
below what would be adequate to the service, and I mean to trust to the
resources of the expedition for the rest; 500 carts will barely carry
fourteen days provisions at a time, and Major General Phillips means 
<PB N="xxxi" REF="177"/> to demand as few horses as possible, subject to
whatever future augmentations future services may require; the present
number wanted will be about 400; there will then remain unprovided for (for
expeditious movement) the transport of bateaux from Lake George to Hudson's
River, and the carriage of the tents of the army, and many other contingencies
that I need not trouble your Excellency to point out to you.</P>

<LETTER>
<HEAD>Extract of a Letter to <HI>General Harvey.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Montreal, 
<DATE>May 19, 1777.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>YOU have permitted me, as formerly, to write to you
confidentially. I take the first conveyance to renew a correspondence so
pleasing and honourable to myself, and that may, in some cases, become
beneficial to the public service. It shall never be employed but to convey
truths, to do justice to facts and persons, and to secure myself in the
continuance of an esteem so valuable to me as yours against appearances
and misrepresentations.</P>
<P>I have reason to be exceedingly satisfied with all that
has been done, and with most things that are doing: exertions have been made
during the winter, which was remark∣ably favourable, in all the departments,
and preparations are very forward; those that have been committed to the
directions of General Phillips have been executed with a diligence,
precision, and foresight, that entitle him to the fullest praise. The
troops are in a state of health almost unprecedented, and their spirits
and general improvement are equally objects of great pleasure and promise.
To this agreeable representation I have the happiness to add, that Sir Guy
Carleton has received me and the orders I brought in a manner that, in my
opinion, does infinite honour to his public and private character.</P>
<P>That he should have wished for the lead in active and
important military operations, is very natural. That he thinks he has some
cause of resentment for the general tenor of treatment he has received from
some of the ministers is discernible; but neither his disappointment
nor his personal feelings operate against his duty; and I am convinced he
means to forward the King's measures, entrusted to my hands, with all the
zeal he could have employed had they rested in his own.</P>
<P>My intention is, during my advance to Ticonderoga, and siege
of that post, for a siege I apprehend it must be, to give all
possible jealousy on the side of Connecticut. If I can by manoeuvre
make them suspect that after the reduction of Ticonderoga my views are
pointed that way, it may make the Connecticut forces very cautious of leaving
their own frontiers, and much facilitate my progress to Albany. I mention
this intention only to Lord George and yourself, and I do it lest from any
intelligence of my motions that may reach England indirectly, it should be
supposed I have suffer∣ed myself to be diverted from the main object of
my orders. The King and his Majesty's ministers may rest assured that
whatever demonstrations I may endeavour to impose upon the enemy, I shall
really make no movement that can procrastinate my progress to Albany.</P>
<P>One thing more occurs. I had the surprise and
mortification to find a paper handed about at Montreal, publishing the whole
design of the campaign, almost as accurately as if it had been copied from
the Secretary of State's letter. My own cau∣tion <PB N="xxxii" REF="178"/> has
been such that not a man in my own family has been let into the secret. Sir
Guy Carleton's, I am confident, has been equal; I am therefore led to doubt
whether imprudence has not been committed from private letters from England,
and wish you would ask my friend D'Oyley, to whom my very affectionate
compliments, whether there is any person within the line of ministerial
communication that he can suspect to be so unguarded? It is not of great
consequence here, except as far as regards St. Leger's expedition; but such
a trick may be of most prejudicial consequence in other cases, and
should be guarded against.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>Camp on the River Bouquet, near Lake Champlain,

<DATE>June 22, 1777.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE had to contend against wet weather that rendered the
roads almost im∣practicable at the carrying places, and consequently the
passage of the bateaux and exceedingly dilatory, besides a great deal of
contrary wind. Indeed the combination of land and water movement, bad roads,
inactivity and sometimes disobedience in the country, and a thousand
other difficulties and accidents, unknown in other services, disconcert all
arrangements. I do not mention this upon my own account, as I do not hold
myself responsible for delays within the province of Canada; but I
mention it to do justice to others, who, I really think, have infinite merit
in overcoming the obstructions we have met with, and who ought to be
justified against some acquain∣tances of yours and mine, who travel
across a map very fast, and are very free in their comments, when others,
who have ten times their knowledge and resources, do not answer their
predictions and expectations.</P>
<P>I have been exceedingly distressed in regard to the
brigadiers of this army. Sir Guy Carleton, the day I took leave of him, put
into my hands an extract of a letter from the Secretary at War, approving the
appointment of those gentlemen, but observing, that whenever any of them
should <HI>lead their brigades out of the province of Canada, in order to
join the troops under General Howe,</HI> there would be a necessity for
their command ceasing as brigadiers, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Were this to be put in execution, according to the letter of
the order, and the geo∣graphical limits of Canada, and supposing Major
General Phillips at the same time to be employed solely in the artillery, I
should find myself at the head of an army to undertake a siege, and
afterwards pursue objects of importance, and possibly of time, without a
single intermediate British officer between the Lieutenant General,
com∣manding <HI>pro tempore</HI> in chief, and a Lieutenant Colonel. It would
be preposterous and impertinent in me to say one word more to you as an
officer, upon the impossibi∣lity of methodizing or conducting such an
army with such a total deficiency of staff. Had Lord Barrington
condescended to have communicated his intentions to me in London, I think I
could have convinced him of the impropriety. As it is, I must conclude that
the spirit of the order goes only to prevent those gentlemen bearing a
higher rank and pay than senior lieutenant colonels serving in the same
army; and that therefore there can be no fault in keeping it dormant till the
junction takes place. In other words, I look upon mine to be the Canada army
till such time as I am in communication with General Howe, so as to make
part of his force, and consequently <PB N="xxxiii" REF="179"/> without
measuring degrees north and south, that the arrangements made in Canada,
and approved of by the King, remain in force till that time.</P>
<P>I am persuaded, my dear General, you will support me in
this liberty, if such it is to be called, not only as the absolute order
and method of the service depends upon it, but also to avoid to these
gentlemen, who have really great merit, the vexation and the ridicule of being
deprived of their rank and pay in the hour of that very service, with a view
to which their appointment was originally made. I think I can answer, that
the junction made, and the reasons for reverting to their former ranks,
become obvious, they will submit to his Majesty's pleasure without a
murmur.</P>

<HEAD>Extract of a Letter from Lieutenant General
<HI>Burgoyne</HI> to General <HI>Harvey.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Head Quarters, Skenesborough, 
<DATE>July 11, 1777.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>THE mere compliment of service I have given to the troops in
orders, and in the relation designed for the Gazette, is not doing them
sufficient justice. It is a duty in me further, through you, and I know I
shall impose a pleasing task on you, to assure the King that their
behaviour is as uniformly good in the camp as in action.</P>
<P>After what I have publicly mentioned of Fraser I am sure I
need not press you in his favour. I cannot but feel confident in the hope
that his Majesty's grace will find its way through all obstacles to prevent
so discouraging a circumstance as the return of this gallant officer to
the mere duty of lieutenant colonel, at the head of one batta∣lion, after
having given ascendancy to the King's troops, and done honour to his
profession, by the most spirited actions in critical periods of two
successive cam∣paigns.</P>
<P>You will observe, Sir, both in the public letter and in the
order of battle, which Captain Gardner will put into your hands, that Major
General Phillips is occasionally employed separately from the strict line
of his department. This does not proceed from inattention to the explanation of
his Majesty's pleasure two years ago; but from absolute necessity.
The staff being composed without any British major general, Bri∣gadier
Fraser being posted where he is of infinite use, at the head of the
advanced corps, the service would suffer in the most material degree if
the talents of General Phillips were not suffered to extend beyond the limits
of the artillery, and I hold myself fully justified in continuing the great
use of his assistance under this extension, by what I understand to
be the signification of the King's pleasure to Sir Guy Carleton, viz.
<HI>That this measure must not be made a precedent,</HI> but not forbidding
it during the present exigency.</P>
<P>I flatter myself the King will be satisfied with the
diligence used in taking the field, as well as with the subsequent
operations; if not, my disappointment can only proceed from my own deficiency
in stating the embarrassments I found, notwithstanding pre∣vious
preparations and cordial assistances. Remote situations of the troops,
currents, winds, roads, want of materials for caulking the vessels,
inactivity and desertion of the Canadian corvées, were all against
me. A great difficulty lay in providing horses and carriages for the bare
transport of provisions and tents, when we should arrive at Fort George,
or any other place where the army should have no resource of water
carriage. I found an active, and I think a reasonable contractor, who
supplied this necessity at a much cheaper rate than it could have been
done any other way. <PB N="xxxiv" REF="180"/> I inclose a copy of the contract
to the treasury, to which I refer you. You will ob∣serve that I have
limited the number to the mere indispensible purposes of provisions and
tents, trusting to the country for the further assistance of officers
baggage and the other attirail of an army. Experience already shews me that I
judged right in not trusting to the country for more; for had this precaution
been omitted, I should be bound fast to the spot where I am, or obliged
to return by water to Ticonderoga.</P>
<P>I avow also to you my advice to General Carleton to grant
commissions to two pro∣vincial battalions, to be raised from Albany and
Charlotte County, by a Mr. Jessup and a Mr. Peters, upon condition that the
commissions should not take place till two thirds of the corps should
be effective, provincial corps, acting zealously in the King's cause,
must have great impression upon public opinion, and will, besides, in
fact be of singular use to the ease and preservation of the regular
troops.</P>
<P>Upon this principle, therefore, I have not hesitated further
to receive and to pay such loyalists as have come in with their arms
since the success of Ticonderoga, and wish to be employed. Though I
have not power to grant commissions, I post the officers, and form them
into companies till the measure can be decided by those who have more
authority.</P>
<P>I hope all these articles of expence will meet with the
support of your opinion; and have only to add, that as no job shall be done
myself, so will I use all efforts to pre∣vent such being done by
others.</P>
<P>I am indispensibly obliged to wait some time on this
position, to clear roads and make bridges, which is great labour in this
country, and to bring up a stock of provision, and also to give time to
the gun-boats, bateaux, and provision vessels to be put into Lake George
to scour that lake, and secure the future route of the maga∣zines. I
propose to possess Fort Edward at the same time that the force is
ready to move down the lake, by which means, if the enemy do not evacuate Fort
George, the garrison must inevitably be caught. In the mean while I have
ordered Reidesel to make roads, reconnoitre the country, and make all other
possible feints of a march to the Connecticut, and by some other
measures I hope to give alarms that way.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN consequence of your Excellency's orders I moved this
morning at four o'clock, with the corps under my command; and after a march of
sixteen miles arrived at Cambridge at four in the evening. On the road I
received intelligence of forty or fifty of the rebels being left to guard
some cattle. I immediately ordered thirty of the provincials and fifty
savages to quicken their march, in hopes to sur∣prize them. They took five
prisoners in arms, who declared themselves to be in the service of the
Congress; yet the enemy received advice of our approach, and abandoned the
house they were posted in. The provincials and savages continued their
march about a mile, when they fell in with a party of fifteen men, who fired
upon our people, and immediately took to the woods with the greatest
precipita∣tion. The fire was quick on our side, but I cannot learn if the
enemy sustained any loss. A private of Captain Sherwood's company was the
only one who was slightly wounded in the thigh. From the many people who came
from Benning∣ton they agree that the number of the enemy amounted to 1800. I
will be particu∣larly careful, on my approach at that place, to be fully
informed of their strength and situation, and take the precautions
necessary to fulfil both the orders and instructions of your
Excellency.</P>
<P>I cannot ascertain the number of cattle, carts, and waggons
taken here, as they have not been as yet collected. A few horses have been
also brought in, but am sorry to acquaint your Excellency that the
savages either destroy or drive away what is not paid for with ready money.
If your Excellency would allow me to purchase the horses from the
savages, stipulating the price, I think they might be procured cheap,
otherwise they ruin all they meet with, their officers and interpre∣ters not
having it in their power to controul them. Your Excellency may depend

<HEAD>Extract of a Letter from Lieutenant General
<HI>Burgoyne,</HI> to Sir <HI>Guy Carleton,</HI> dated Head-Quarters, at
Skenesborough House, 11th July, 1777.</HEAD>
<P>I REQUEST your Excellency to take into consideration the
expediency of supply∣ing from Canada, a garrison for Ticonderoga.</P>
<P>My communication will widen so much as I proceed, the drain
upon the army for posts will be so considerable, not to speak of
detachments and safe-guards to protect and to awe the country, that if that
first diminution is not replaced, my effective strength may become
inadequate to the services intended. My present intelligence is that Putnam
is collecting an army to oppose me at Saratoga. Fort Edward is also talked
of to sustain a siege.</P>
<P>Your excellency will, I am sure, agree with me that
Ticonderoga, or some other fortified post on the South part of Lake
Champlain, ought to be considered on the frontiers of the province of Canada.
I am aware of the difficulties that arise from the manner in which the
Secretary of State's orders are penned; but I submit to your Excellency,
whether, under the principle laid down in the beginning of the order, and
afterwards repeated, <HI>that</HI> 3000 <HI>men were held sufficient for the
defence of that province,</HI> you would not be justified in sparing for
the purpose of this garrison, the overplus of the 3000 that may remain
after compleating my army.</P>
<P>And notwithstanding the corps for the Canada service are
precisely named by the Secretary of State, I would further submit whether,
upon my pressing requisition, the garrison might not justifiably be
furnished by detachment, even though there was no overplus, under the
following words of the order; <HI>after haviug secured to him,</HI>
(Lieutenant General Burgoyne) <HI>every assistance which it is in your
power to afford and procure.</HI> Your Excellency's zeal for the service and
favour towards me, will be better interpreters for the latitude I propose,
than any thing I can further suggest; my present purpose, Sir, is to
get a sufficient number of gun-boats upon the Lake George to scour that
lake as expeditiously as possible, to support them with a proper force
to attack Fort George on that side, while with the main of the army as soon
as re∣freshed and supplied, I attack Fort Edward from hence, and therebycut
off the com∣munication from Albany to Fort George, and consequently prevent
the succour or retreat of that garrison.</P>

<LETTER>
<HEAD>Extract of a Letter from Lieutenant General
<HI>Burgoyne,</HI> to Sir <HI>Guy Carleton,</HI> Head-Quarters, near Fort Anne,
July 29th 1777.</HEAD>
<P>THE construction your excellency puts upon the orders of the
Secretary of State, is too full and decisive for me to presume to trouble
you further upon the subject of a garrison for Ticonderoga from Canada, I
must do as well as I can, but I am sure your Excellency, as a soldier,
will think my situation a little difficult. A breach into my communication
must either ruin my army entirely, or oblige me to return in force to
restore, which might be the loss of the campaign. To prevent a breach,
Ticonderoga and Fort George must be in very respectable strength, and I
must besides have posts at Fort Edward and other carrying-places. These
drains added to common accidents and losses of service, will
necessarily render me very inferior in <PB N="xliii" REF="189"/> point of
numbers to the enemy, whom I must expect always to find strongly posted.
I ask pardon for dwelling so much upon this subject, and have only to add
my re∣quest to your Excellency to forward the additional companies as
expeditiously as may be.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE accounts you have sent me are very satisfactory, and I
have no doubt of every part of your proceeding continuing to be the same.</P>
<P>I beg the favour of you to report whether the road you have
passed is practicable, and if so, if it is convenient for a
considerable corps with cannon.</P>
<P>Should you find the enemy too strongly posted at
Bennington, and maintaining such a countenance as may make an attack
imprudent, I wish you to take a post where you can maintain yourself till
you receive an answer from me, and I will either support you in force, or
withdraw you.</P>
<P>You will please to send off to my camp, as soon as you
can, waggons, and draft cattle, and likewise such other cattle as are not
necessary for your subsistence.</P>
<P>Let the waggons and carts bring off all the flour and wheat
they can that you do not retain for the same purpose. This transport
must be under the charge of a com∣mission officer.</P>
<P>I will write you at full to-morrow in regard to getting
horses out of the hands of the savages.</P>
<P>In the mean time any you can collect from them, fit to mount
the regiments, at a low price, shall be allowed.</P>

<LETTER>
<HEAD><NOTE PLACE="marg">No. XIII.</NOTE>Colonel St.
<HI>Leger's</HI> Account of Occurrences at <HI>Fort Stanwix.</HI></HEAD>
<P>A MINUTE detail of every operation since my leaving La Chine,
with the de∣tachment entrusted to my care, your Excellency will permit me to
reserve to a time of less hurry and mortification than the present, while
I enter into the interesting scene before Fort Stanwix, which I invested
the 3d of August, having previously pushed forward Lieutenant Bird of the
King's reigment, with thirty of the King's troops and two hundred Indians,
under the direction of Captains Hare and Wilson, and the chiefs Joseph and
Bull, to seize fast hold of the lower landing-place, and there∣by cut off
the enemy's communication with the lower country.—This was done with
great address by the lieutenant, though not attended with the effect I had
promised myself, occasioned by the slackness of the
Messasagoes. The brigade of provision and ammunition boats I had
intelligence of, being arrived and disembarked before this party had taken
post.</P>
<P><PB N="lxiv" REF="190"/> The fourth and fifth were employed in
making arrangements for opening Wood Creek (which the enemy, with the
indefatigable labour of one hundred and fifty men, for fourteen days, had
most effectually choaked up) and the making a tempo∣rary road from Pine
Ridges upon Fish Creek, sixteen miles from the fort, for a present
supply of provision and the transport of our artillery: the first was
effected by the diligence and zeal of Captain Bouville, assisted by
Captain Harkimer of the Indian department, with one hundred and ten men, in
nine days; while Lieutenant Lundy, acting as assistant quarter-master
general, had rendered the road in the worst of weather, sufficiently
practicable to pass the whole artillery and stores, with seven days
provision, in two days.</P>
<P>On the 5th, in the evening, intelligence arrived by my
discovering parties on the Mohawk River, that a reinforcement of eight
hundred militia, conducted by General Herkimer, were on their march to relieve
the garrison, and were actually at that in∣stant at Oriska, an Indian
settlement, twelve miles from the fort. The garrison be∣ing apprised of
their march by four men, who were seen enter the fort in the mor∣ning,
through what was thought an impenetrable swamp, I did not think it pru∣dent
to wait for them, and thereby subject myself to be attacked by a sally
from the garrison in the rear, while the reinforcement employed me in front.
I therefore de∣termined to attack them on the march, either openly or covertly,
as circumstances should offer. At this time, I had not two hundred and
fifty of the King's troops in camp; the various and extensive operations I
was under an absolute necessity of entering into, having employed the
rest; and therefore, could not send above eighty white men, rangers and
troops included, with the whole corps of Indians. Sir John Johnson put
himself at the head of this party, and began his march that evening at five
o'clock, and met the rebel corps at the same hour the next morning. The
im∣petuosity of the Indians is not to be described on the sight of the
enemy (forgetting the judicious disposition formed by Sir John, and agreed
to by themselves, which was, to suffer the attack to begin with the troops
in front, while they should be on both flanks and rear) they rushed in,
hatchet in hand, and thereby gave the enemy's rear an op∣portunity to escape.
In relation to the victory, it was equally complete, as if the whole had
fallen; nay more so, as the two hundred who escaped only served to
spread the panic wider; but it was not so with the Indians; their loss
was great (I must be understood Indian computation, being only about thirty
killed, and the like number wounded, and in that number some of their
favourite chiefs and confidential warriors were slain.) On the enemy's
side, almost all their principal leaders were slain. Ge∣neral Herkimer
has since died of his wounds. It is proper to mention, that the four men
detached with intelligence of the march of the reinforcement, set out the
evening before the action, and consequently the enemy could have no account
of the defeat, and were in possession only, of the time appointed for
their arrival; at which, as I suspected, they made a sally with two
hundred and fifty men towards Lieutenant Bird's post, to facilitate the
entrance of the relieving corps, or bring on a general en∣gagement, with every
advantage they could wish.</P>
<P>Captain Hoyes was immediately detached to cut in upon their
rear, while they engaged the lieutenant. Immediately upon the departure of
Captain Hoyes, having learned that Lieutenant Bird, misled by the information
of a cowardly Indian, that Sir John was pressed, had quitted his post to
march to his assistance, I marched <PB N="lxvii" REF="191"/> the
detachment of the King's regiment, in support of Captain Hoyes, by a road in
sight of the garrison, which, with executive fire from his party,
immediately drove the enemy into the fort, without any further advantage than
frightening some squaws and pilfering the packs of the warriors which they
left behind them. After this affair was over, orders were immediately given to
compleat a two-gun battery, and mortar beds, with three strong redoubts in
their rear, to enable me, in case of another attempt, to relieve the
garrison by their regimented troops, to march out a larger body of the King's
troops.</P>
<P>Captain Lernoult was sent with 110 men to the lower landing
place, where he established himself with great judgment and strength,
having an enclosed battery of a three-pounder opposed to any sally from
the fort, and another to the side of the country, where a relief must
approach; and the body of his camp deeply en∣trenched and abbatised.</P>
<P>When by the unabating labour of officers and men (the
smallness of our num∣bers never admitting of a relief, or above three hours
cessation for sleep or cooking) the batteries and redoubts were
finished, and new cheeks and axle-trees made for the six-pounders, those
that were sent being reported rotten and unserviceable.</P>
<P>It was found that our cannon had not the least effect upon the
sod-work of the fort, and that our royals had only the power of teizing, as a
six-inch plank was a sufficient security for their powder magazine, as we
learnt from the deserters. At this time Lieutenant Glenie of the artillery,
whom I had appointed to act as assistant engineer, proposed a
conversion of the royals (if I may use the expression) into howitzers.
The ingenuity and feasability of this measure striking me very
strongly, the business was set about immediately, and soon executed,
when it was found that nothing prevented their operating with the desired
effect but the distance, their chambers being too small to hold a
sufficiency of powder. There was nothing now to be done but to approach the
town by sap to such a distance that the ram∣part might be brought within
their portice, at the same time all materials were preparing to run a mine
under their most formidable bastion.</P>
<P>In the midst of these operations intelligence was brought in
by our scouts, of a second corps of 1000 men being on their march. The
same zeal no longer animated the Indians; they complained of our thinness
of troops and their former losses. I immediately called a council of the
chiefs; encouraged them as much as I could; promised to lead them on
myself, and bring into the field 300 of the best troops. They listened to
this, and promised to follow me, and agreed that I should recon∣noitre the
ground properest for the field of battle the next morning, accompanied by
some of their chief warriors, to settle the plan of operations. When upon
the ground appointed for the field of battle, scouts came in with the account
of the first number swelled to 2000; immediately after a third, that
General Burgoyne's army was cut to pieces, and that Arnold was advancing, by
rapid and forced marches, with 3000 men. It was at this moment I began to
suspect cowardice in some, and treason in others; however I returned to
camp, not without hopes, with the as∣sistance of my gallant coadjutor,
Sir John Johnson, and the influence of the super∣intending colonels, Claus
and Butler, of inducing them to meet the enemy. A council, according to their
custom, was called, to know their resolutions, before the breaking up of
which I learned that 200 were already decamped. In about an hour 
<PB N="xlvi" REF="192"/> they insisted that I should retreat, or they
would be obliged to abandon me. I had no other party to take, and a hard party
it was to troops who could do nothing without them, to yield to their
resolves; and therefore proposed to retire at night, sending on before my
sick, wounded, artillery, &amp;c. down the Wood Creek, co∣vering them by our
line of march.</P>
<P>This did not fall in with their views, which were no less than
treacherously com∣mitting ravage upon their friends, as they had lost the
opportunity of doing it upon their enemies. To effect this they artfully
caused messengers to come in, one after the other, with accounts of the
nearer approaches of the rebels; one and the last affirmed that they were
within two miles of Captain Lernoult's post. Not giving entire credit to
this, and keeping to my resolution of retiring by night, they grew furious
and abandoned; seized upon the officers' liquor and cloaths, in spite of
the efforts of their servants; and became more formidable than the enemy we
had to expect. I now thought it time to call in Captain Lernoult's post,
retiring with the troops in camp to the ruined fort called William, in the
front of the garrison, not only to wait the enemy, if they thought proper to
sally, but to pro∣tect the boats from the fury of the savages, having
sent forward Captain Hoyes, with his detachment, with one piece of cannon, to
the place where Bull Fort stood, to receive the troops who waited the arrival
of Captain Lernoult. Most of the boats were escorted that night beyond
Canada Creek, where no danger was to be apprehended from the enemy. The creek
at this place bending from the road, has a deep cedar swamp between. Every
attention was now turned to the mouth of the creek, which the enemy might have
possessed themselves of by a rapid march by the Oneyda Castle. At
this place the whole of the little army arrived by twelve o'clock at night, and
took post in such a manner as to have no fears of any thing the enemy could
do. Here we remained till three o'clock next morning, when the boats which
could come up the Creek arrived, or rather that the rascally part of all
nations of the Indians would suffer to come up; and proceeded across Lake
Oneyda to the ruined fort of Brereton, where I learnt that some boats were
still labouring down the creek, after being lightened of the best part of
their freight by the Messasagoes. Captain Lernoult proposed, with a
boat full of armed men, to repass the lake that night, to relieve them from
their labour, and supply them with provision. This transaction does as
much honour to the humanity as to the gallantry of this valuable officer.</P>
<P>On my arrival at the Onondago Falls I received an answer to my
letter from your Excellency, which shewed, in the clearest light, the
scenes of treachery that had been practised upon me. The messenger had
heard indeed on his way that they were collecting the same kind of rabble as
before, but that there was not an enemy within forty miles of Fort Stanwix.</P>
<P>Soon after my arrival here I was joined by Captain Lernoult,
with the men and boats he had been in search of. I mean immediately to send
off, for the use of the upper garrison, all the overplus provision I
shall have, after keeping a sufficiency to carry my detachment down, which
I mean to do with every expedition in my power the moment this business is
effected, for which purpose I have ordered here the snow. The sloop is
already gone from this with her full lading.</P>
<P><PB N="xlvii" REF="193"/> Officers from each corps are sent to
Montreal to procure necessaries for the men, who are in a most deplorable
situation from the plunder of the savages, that no time may be lost to
join your army.</P>

<HI>Albany,</HI> 20th <HI>October,</HI> 1777.</HEAD>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>NO possibility of communication with your Lordship
having existed since the beginning of September, at which time my last
dispatch was sent away, I have to re∣port to your Lordship the
proceedings of the army under my command from that period: a series of hard
toil, incessant effort, stubborn action; till disabled in the
collateral branches of the army by the total defection of the Indians; the
desertion or timidity of the Canadians and Provincials, some individuals
excepted; disappointed in the last hope of any timely co-operation from
other armies; the regular troops re∣duced by losses from the best part to
3500 fighting men, not 2000 of which were British; only three days
provisions upon short allowance in store; invested by an army of 16,000
men, and no apparent means of retreat remaining, I called into council all the
generals, field officers, and captains commanding corps, and by their unanimous
concurrence and advice, I was induced to open a treaty with Major General
Gates.</P>
<P>Your Lordship will see, by the papers transmitted
herewith, the disagreeable pro∣spect which attended the first overtures;
and when the terms concluded are compared, I trust that the spirit of the
councils I have mentioned, which under such circum∣stances dictated
instead of submitting, will not be refused a share of credit.</P>
<P>Before I enter upon the detail of these events, I think it a
duty of justice, my Lord, to take upon myself the measure of having
passed the Hudson's River, in order to force a passage to Albany. I
did not think myself authorised to call any men into council, when the
peremptory tenor of my orders and the season of the year admitted no
alternative.</P>
<P>Provisions for about thirty days having been brought
forward, the other necessary stores prepared, and the bridge of boats
completed, the army passed the Hudson's River on the 13th and 14th of
September, and incamped on the heights, and in the plain of Saratoga, the enemy
being then in the neighbourhood of Stillwater.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">15th.</NOTE>The whole army made a movement
forward, and incamped in a good position in a place called Dovacote.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">16th.</NOTE>It being found that there were
several bridges to repair, that work was begun under cover of strong
detachments, and the same opportunity was taken to reconnoitre the
country.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">17th.</NOTE>The army renewed their march,
repaired other bridges, and encamped upon ad∣vantageous ground about four miles
from the enemy.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">18th.</NOTE>The enemy appeared in
considerable force to obstruct the further repair of bridges, and with a
view, as it was conceived, to draw on an action where artillery could not 
<PB N="xlviii" REF="194"/> be employed. A small loss was sustained in
skirmishing, but the work of the bridges was effected.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Sept. 19.</NOTE>The passages of a great
ravine, and other roads towards the enemy, having been reconnoitred, the army
advanced in the following order.</P>
<P>Brigadier General Fraser's corps, sustained by
Lieutenant Colonel Breyman's corps, made a circuit, in order to pass the
ravine commodiously, without quitting the heights, and afterwards to cover
the march of the line to the right. These corps moved in three columns, and
had the Indians, Canadians, and Provincials upon their fronts and flanks. The
British line led by me in person passed the ravine in a direct line
south, and formed in order of battle as fast as they gained the summit,
where they waited to give time to Fraser's corps to make the circuit, and to
enable the left wing and artillery, which, under the commands of Major General
Phillips, and Major General Reidesel, kept the great road and meadows near
the river in two columns, and had bridges to repair, to be equally ready to
proceed. The 47th regiment guarded the bateaux.</P>
<P>The signal guns, which had been previously settled to
give notice of all the columns being ready to advance, having been fired
between one and two o'clock, the march continued. The scouts and flankers of
the column of the British line were soon fired upon from small parties
but with no effect. After about an hour's march, the picquets, which made the
advanced guard of that column, were attacked in force, and obliged to give
ground, but they soon rallied and were sustained.</P>
<P>On the first opening of the wood I formed the troops. A few
cannon-shot dis∣lodged the enemy at a house from whence the picquets had
been attacked, and Brigadier General Fraser's corps had arrived with such
precision in point of time, as to be found upon a very advantageous height on
the right of the British.</P>
<P>In the mean time the enemy, not acquainted with the
combination of the march, had moved in great force out of their intrenchments,
with a view of turning the line upon the right, and being checked by the
disposition of Brigadier General Fraser, counter∣marched, in order to
direct their great effort to the left of the British.</P>
<P>From the nature of the country, movements of this sort,
however near, may be effected without a possibility of their being
discovered.</P>
<P>About three o'clock the action began by a very vigorous attack
on the British line, and continued with great obstinacy till after
sunset. The enemy being continually supplied with fresh troops, the
stress lay upon the 20th, 21st, and
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>2d regiments, most parts of which
were engaged near four hours without intermission; the 9th had been ordered
early in the day to form in reserve.</P>
<P>The grenadiers and 24th regiment were some part of the time
brought into action, as were part of the light infantry, and all these corps
charged with their usual spirit.</P>
<P>The riflemen, and other parts of Breyman's corps, were also
of service; but it was not thought advisable to evacuate the heights where
Brigadier General Fraser was posted otherwise than partially and
occasionally.</P>
<P>Major General Phillips upon first hearing the firing found
his way through a diffi∣cult part of the wood to the scene of action, and
brought up with him Major Williams and four pieces of artillery, and from that
moment I stood indebted to that gallant and judicious second, for
incessant and most material services, particularly for restoring the
action in a point which was critically pressed by a great superiority of
fire, and to which he led up the 20th regiment at the utmost personal
hazard.</P>
<P><PB N="xlix" REF="195"/> Major-General Riedesel exerted
himself to bring up a part of the left wing, and arrived in time to charge
the enemy with regularity and bravery.</P>
<P>Just as the light closed, the enemy gave ground on all
sides, and left us com∣pletely masters of the field of battle, with the
loss of about five hundred men on their side, and, as supposed, thrice
that number wounded.</P>
<P>The darkness preventing a pursuit, the prisoners were
few.</P>
<P>The behaviour of the officers and men in general was
exemplary. Brigadier-General Fraser took his position in the beginning of
the day with great judgment, and sustained the action with constant
presence of mind and vigour. Brigadier-General Hamilton was the whole time
engaged and acquitted himself with great honour, ac∣tivity and good
conduct.</P>
<P>The artillery in general was distinguished, and the
brigade under Captain Jones, who was killed in the action, was
conspicuously so.</P>
<P>The army lay upon their arms the night of the 19th, and the
next day took a position nearly within cannon shot of the enemy, fortifying
their right, and exten∣ding their left to the brow of the heights, so as to
cover the meadows through which the great river runs, and where their bateaux
and hospitals were placed. The 47th regiment, the regiment of Hesse
Hanau, and a corps of Provincials in∣camped in the meadows as a further
security.</P>
<P>It was soon found that no fruits, honour excepted, were
attained by the preceding victory, the enemy working with redoubled ardor to
strengthen their left: their right was already unattackable.</P>
<P>On our side it became expedient to erect strong redoubts
for the protection of the magazines and hospital, not only against a
sudden attack, but also for their security in case of a march to turn
the enemy's flank.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">September 21.</NOTE>A messenger arrived
from Sir Harry Clinton with a letter in cypher, informing me of his intention
to attack Fort Montgomery in about ten days from the date of his letter, which
was the 12th instant. This was the only messenger of many that I
apprehend were dispatched by Sir William Howe, and him that had reached my
camp since the beginning of August. He was sent back the same night to
in∣form Sir Harry of my situation, and of the necessity of a diversion
to oblige General Gates to detach from his army, and my intention to wait
favourable events in that position, if possible, to the 12th of
October.</P>
<P>In the course of the two following days, two officers in
disguise, and other confi∣dential persons, were dispatched by different
routes with verbal messages to the same effect, and I continued
fortifying my camp and watching the enemy, whose numbers increased every
day.</P>
<P>I thought it advisable on the 3d of October to diminish
the soldiers' ration in order to lengthen out the provisions, to which
measure the army submitted with the utmost chearfulness. The
difficulties of a retreat to Canada were clearly foreseen, as was the
dilemma, should the retreat be effected, of leaving at liberty such an army
as General Gates's to operate against Sir William Howe.</P>
<P>This consideration operated forcibly to determine me to
abide events as long as possible, and I reasoned thus. The expedition I
commanded was evidently meant at first to be <HI>hazarded.</HI>
Circumstances might require it should be <HI>devoted.</HI> A critical
junction of Mr. Gates's force with Mr. Washington might possibly decide
the fate <PB N="l" REF="196"/> of the war; the failure of my junction with Sir
Harry Clinton, or the loss of my retreat to Canada could only be a partial
misfortune.</P>
<P>In this situation things continued till the seventh, when
no intelligence having been received of the expected co-operation, and four or
five days for our limited stay in the camp only remained, it was judged
advisable to make a movement to the enemy's left, not only to discover
whether there were any possible means of forcing a passage should it
be necessary to advance, or of dislodging him for the convenience of a
retreat, but also to cover a forage of the army which was in the greatest
distress on accouut of the scarcity.</P>
<P>A detachment of fifteen hundred regular troops with two twelve
pounders, two howitzers, and six six-pounders, were ordered to move, and
were commanded by myself, having with me Major-General Phillips,
Major-General Reidesel, and Brigadier-General Fraser.</P>
<P>The guard of the camp upon the heights was left to
Brigadier-General Hamilton and Specht, the redoubts and the plain to Brigadier
General Gall; and as the force of the enemy immediately in their front
consisted of more than double their num∣bers, it was not possible to
augment the corps that marched, beyond the numbers above stated.</P>
<P>I formed the troops within three-quarters of a mile of the
enemy's left, and Captain Fraser's rangers, with Indians and Provincials, had
orders to go by secret paths in the woods to gain the enemy's rear, and by
shewing themselves there to keep them in a check.</P>
<P>The further operations intended, were prevented by a very
sudden and rapid attack of the enemy on our left, where the British
grenadiers were posted to support the left wing of the line. Major Acland
at the head of them sustained the attack with great resolution; but the
enemy's great numbers enabling them in a few minutes to extend the attack along
the front of the Germans, which were immediately on the right of the
grenadiers, no part of that body could be removed to make a second line to
the flank, where the stress of the fire lay. The right was at this time
en∣gaged, but it was soon observed that the enemy were marching a large
corps round their flank to endeavour cutting off their retreat. The light
infantry and part of the 24th regiment which were at that post were therefore
ordered to form a second line, and to secure the return of the troops into
camp. While this movement was pro∣ceeding the enemy pushed a fresh and
strong reinforcement to renew the action upon the left, which, overpowered by
a great superiority, gave way, and the light in∣fantry and 24th regiment were
obliged to make a quick movement to save that point from being entirely
carried, in doing which, Brigadier-General Fraser was mortally wounded.</P>
<P>The danger to which the lines were exposed becoming at this
moment of the most serious nature, orders were given to Major-General
Phillips and Reidesel to cover the retreat, while such troops as were
most ready for the purpose, returned for the defence of them. The troops
retreated hard pressed, but in good order; they were obliged to leave six
pieces of cannon, all the horses having been killed, and most of the
artillery-men, who had behaved as usual with the utmost bravery under the
command of Major Williams, being either killed or wounded.</P>
<P>The troops had scarcely entered the camp when it was
stormed with great fury, the enemy rushing to the lines under a severe
fire of grape-shot and small arms. <PB N="li" REF="197"/> The post of the
light infantry under Lord Balcarras assisted by some of the line, which
threw themselves by order into the intrenchments, was defended with great
spirit, and the enemy led on by General Arnold was finally repulsed, and
the General wounded; but unhappily the intrenchments of the German reserve,
commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel Breymann, who was killed, were carried, and
although ordered to be recovered, they never were so, and the enemy by that
misfortune gained an opening on our right and rear. The night put an end to the
action.</P>
<P>Under the disadvantages thus apparent in our situation,
the army was ordered to quit the present position during the night and take
post upon the heights above the hospital.</P>
<P>Thus by an entire change of front, to reduce the enemy to form
a new disposition. This movement was effected in great order and without
loss, though all the artillery and camp were removed at the same time. The
army continued offering battle to the enemy in their new position the whole
day of the 8th.</P>
<P>Intelligence was now received that the enemy were marching to
turn the right, and no means could prevent that measure but retiring towards
Saratoga. The army began to move at nine o'clock at night, Major-General
Reidesel commanding the van-guard, and Major-General Phillips the rear.</P>
<P>This retreat, though within musquet-shot of the enemy, and
encumbered with all the baggage of the army, was made without loss, but a
very heavy rain and the difficulties of guarding the bateaux which contained
all the provisions, occasioned delays which prevented the army reaching
Saratoga till the night of the 9th, and the artillery could not pass the
fords of the Fish-kill till the morning of the 10th.</P>
<P>At our arrival near Saratoga, a corps of the enemy, between
five and six hundred, were discovered throwing up intrenchments on the
heights, but retired over a ford of the Hudson's River at our approach, and
joined a body posted to oppose our passage there.</P>
<P>It was judged proper to send a detachment of artificers
under a strong escort to re∣pair the bridges and open a road to Fort-Edward
on the west side of the river. The 47th regiment, Captain Fraser's
marksmen, and Mackoy's Provincials, were ordered for that service, but the
enemy appearing on the heights of the Fish-kill in great force, and making a
disposition to pass and give us battle: the 47th regiment and Fraser's
marksmen were recalled; the Provincials left to cover the workmen at the
first bridge run away upon a very slight attack of a small party of the
enemy, and left the artificers to escape as they could, without a
possibility of their performing any work.</P>
<P>During these different movements the bateaux with
provisions were frequently fired upon from the opposite side of the
river, and some of them were lost, and several men were killed and
wounded in those which remained.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">October 11.</NOTE>The attacks upon the
bateaux were continued, several were taken and retaken, but their situation
being much nearer to the main force of the enemy than to ours, it was found
impossible to secure the provisions any otherwise than by landing
them and carrying them upon the hill: this was effected under fire, and with
great difficulty.</P>
<P>The possible means of further retreat were now
considered in councils of war, composed of the general officers, minutes of
which will be transmitted to your Lordship.</P>
<P><PB N="lii" REF="198"/> The only one that seemed at all
practicable was, by a night march to gain Fort-Edward with the troops carrying
their provision upon their backs; the impossibility of repairing bridges,
putting a conveyance of artillery and carriages out of the question, it was
proposed to force the ford at Fort-Edward, or the ford above it. Before this
attempt could be made, scouts returned with intelligence that the enemy were
intrenched opposite these fords, and possessed a camp in force on
the high ground between Fort-Edward and Fort-George with cannon. They had
also parties down the whole shore to watch our motions, and posts so
near to us, upon our own side of the water as must prevent the army moving
a single mile undiscovered.</P>
<P>The bulk of the enemy's army was hourly joined by new corps of
militia and vo∣lunteers, and their numbers together amounted to upwards of
16,000 men. Their position, which extended three parts in four of a circle
round us, was from the nature of the ground unattackable in all parts.</P>
<P>In this situation the army took the best position
possible and fortified, waiting till the 13th at night, in the anxious hope
of succours from our friends, or the next desirable expectation, an attack
from our enemy.</P>
<P>During this time the men lay continually upon their arms, and
were cannonaded in every part, even rifle-shot and grape-shot came into all
parts of the line, though with∣out any considerable effect.</P>
<P>At this period an exact account of the provisions was taken,
and the circumstances stated in the opening of this letter became
compleat.</P>
<P>The council of war was extended to all the field officers and
captains commanding corps of the army, and the event ensued which I am sure
was inevitable, and which, I trust, in that situation was honourable, but
which it would be superfluous and melan∣choly to repeat.</P>
<P>After the execution of the treaty, General Gates drew together
the force that had surrounded my position, and I had the consolation to
have as many witnesses as I have men under my command, of its amounting to
the numbers mentioned above.</P>
<P>During the events stated above, an attempt was made
against Ticonderoga by an army assembled under Major General Lincoln, who
found means to march with a con∣siderable corps from Huberton undiscovered,
while another column of his force passed the mountains between
Skenesborough and Lake George, and on the morning of the 18th of September a
sudden and general attack was made upon the carrying place at Lake George,
Sugar Hill, Ticonderoga, and Mount Independence. The sea officers commanding
the armed sloop stationed to defend the carrying place, as also some of
the officers commanding at the posts of Sugar Hill and at the Portage were
surprised, and a considerable part of four companies of the 53d regiment
were made prisoners; a block-house, commanded by Lieutenant Lord of the
53d, was the only post on that side that had time to make use of their
arms, and they made a brave defence till cannon taken from the surprised
vessel was brought against them.</P>
<P>After stating and lamenting so fatal a want of vigilance,
I have to inform your Lordship of the satisfactory events which
followed.</P>
<P>The enemy having twice summoned Brigadier General Powell,
and received such answer as became a gallant officer entrusted with so
important a post, and having tried during the course of four days several
attacks, and being repulsed in all, retreated without having done any
considerable damage.</P>
<P>Brigadier General Powell, from whose report to me I extract
this relation, gives great commendations to the regiment of Prince Frederick,
and the other troops sta∣tioned <PB N="liii" REF="199"/> at Mount
Independence. The Brigadier also mentions with great applause the behaviour
of Captain Taylor of the 21st regiment, who was accidentally there on his
route to the army from the hospital, and Lieutenant Beecroft of the 24th
regiment, who with the artificers in arms defended an important battery.</P>
<P>On the 24th instant, the enemy, enabled by the capture of
the gun-boats and ba∣teaux which they had made after the surprise of the
sloop, to embark upon Lake George, attacked Diamond Island in two
divisions.</P>
<P>Captain Aubrey and two companies of the 47th regiment, had
been posted at that island from the time the army passed the Hudson's
River, as a better situation for the security of the stores at the
south end of Lake George than Fort George, which is on the continent, and not
tenable against artillery and numbers, The enemy were re∣pulsed by Captain
Aubrey with great loss, and pursued by the gun-boats under his command to
the east shore, where two of their principal vessels were retaken,
together with all the cannon. They had just time to set fire to the other
bateaux, and retreated over the mountains.</P>
<P>I beg leave to refer your Lordship for further particulars
to my aid-de-camp, Lord Petersham, and I humbly take occasion to recommend
to his Majesty's notice that no∣bleman, as one endued with qualities to do
important services to his country in every station to which his birth may
lead. In this late campaign in particular, his beha∣viour has been such as to
entitle him to the fullest applause, and I am confident his merit will be
thought a sufficient ground for preferment, though deprived of the
<HI>eclat</HI> and sort of claim which generally attends the delivery of
fortunate dispatches.</P>
<P>I have only to add, my Lord, a general report of the killed
and wounded; I do not give it correct, the hurry of the time and the
separation of the corps having ren∣dered it impossible to make it so.
The British officers have bled profusely and most honourably; those who
remain unwounded have been equally forward, and the gene∣ral officers from the
mode of fighting have been more exposed than in other services. Among the
rest of this station, I have had my escapes. It depends upon the
sentence his Majesty shall pass upon my conduct; upon the judgment of
my profession, and of the impartial and respectable parts of my country,
whether I am to esteem them bles∣sings or misfortunes.</P>

<LETTER>
<HEADNOTE>
<P>[Private, by Lord <HI>Petersham.</HI>]</P>
</HEADNOTE>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE little to add to my public letter respecting the
course of unsuccessful events, therein detailed. I rest my confidence
in the justice of the King and his councils, to support the General they
thought proper to appoint to as arduous an un∣dertaking, and under as
positive a direction, as perhaps a cabinet ever framed. It will, I am sure,
be remembered, my Lord, that a preference of exertions was the only latitude
given me, and that to force a junction with Sir William Howe, or at least a
passage to Albany, was the principle, the letter, and the spirit of my
orders.</P>
<P><PB N="liv" REF="200"/> Indeed the appearances at the time I
passed the Hudson's-River, though subject to doubt in some
instances, as I then wrote your Lordship, were upon a general view, such
as I am persuaded would have rendered inaction censurable, had my orders,
instead of being peremptory, been discretionary. Promises of the
professing loyalists were not then brought to the test; the spirit of
the enemy, in combat against regular British troops, had only been tried at
Ticonderago, at Huberton, at Skenesborough, and Fort Anne; in all which
places it had failed; the total disappointment of effectual co-operation,
could not be foreseen or supposed; and sure I am, had I then made
suppo∣sition that any thing like what has happened, might have happened,
and remained cautiously posted, no exertion attempted, my conduct would
have been held indefen∣sible by every class and distinction of men in
government, in the army, and in the public.</P>
<P>The expediency of advancing being admitted, the consequences
have been honou∣rable misfortunes. The British have persevered in a
strenuous and bloody pro∣gress. Had the force been all British, perhaps
the perseverance had been longer; but as it was, will it be said, my Lord,
that in the exhausted situation described, and in the jaws of famine, and
invested by quadruple numbers, a treaty which saves the army to the
state, for the next campaign, was not more than could have been expected? I I
call it saving the army, because if sent home, the state is thereby
enabled to send forth the troops now destined for her internal defence; if
exchanged, they become a force to Sir William Howe, as effectually, as if any
other junction had been made.</P>
<P>I should now hold myself unjustifiable if I did not
confide to your Lordship, my opinion, upon a near inspection, of the rebel
troops. The standing corps which I have seen, are disciplined. I do not
hazard the term, but apply it to the great funda∣mental points of military
institution, sobriety, subordination, regularity and courage. The militia
are inferior in method and movement, but not a jot less serviceable in
woods. My conjectures were very different after the affair of Ticonderago, but
I am convinced they were delusive; and it is a duty to the state to
confess it.</P>
<P>The panic of the rebel troops is confined, and of short
duration; the enthusiasim is extensive and permanent.</P>
<P>It is a justice to Major General Phillips, to inform your
Lordship, that when the crisis of our situation at Saratoga arrived, he
very handsomely offered to hazard his person by making a circuit through
the woods, and attempt to throw himself into Ticondera∣go, to defend that
place, should it be the object of the enemy to endeavour the re∣taking
it.</P>
<P>In regard to myself, I am sunk in mind and body; but while
I have a faculty of either, it shall be exerted for the King's service. I
shall wait in the neighbourhood of Boston, the orders of Sir William
Howe.</P>

<LIST>
<ITEM>Lieutenant General BURGOYNE,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Major General REIDESEL,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Major General PHILIPS,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Brigadier General HAMILTON.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>THE Lieutenant General states to the council the present
situation of affairs.</P>
<P>The enemy in force, according to the best intelligence he can
obtain, to the amount of upwards of 14,000 men, and a considerable quantity
of artillery, are on this side the Fish-kill, and threaten an attack. On
the other side the Hudson's River, between this army and Fort Edward, is
another army of the enemy, the numbers unknown; but one corps, which there has
been an opportunity of observing, is reported to be about 1500 men. They have
likewise cannon on the other side the Hudson's River, and they have a
bridge below Saratoga church, by which the two armies can communi∣cate.</P>
<P>The bateaux of the army have been destroyed, and no means
appear of making a bridge over the Hudson's River, were it even practicable
from the position of the enemy.</P>
<P>The only means of retreat, therefore, are by the ford at Fort
Edward, or taking the mountains in order to pass the river higher up by
rafts, or by any other ford which is reported to be practicable with
difficulty, or by keeping the mountains, to pass the head of Hudson's
River, and continue to the westward of Lake George all the way to
Ticonderoga; it is true, this last passage was never made but by Indians,
or very small bodies of men.</P>
<P>In order to pass cannon or any wheel carriages from hence to
Fort Edward, some bridges must be repaired under fire of the enemy from the
opposite side of the river, and the principal bridge will be a work of
fourteen or fifteen hours; there is no good position for the army to take to
sustain that work, and if there were, the time stated as necessary,
would give the enemy on the other side the Hudson's River an opportunity to
take post on the strong ground above Fort Edward, or to dispute the ford
while General Gates's army followed in the rear.</P>
<P>The intelligence from the lower part of Hudson's River is
founded upon the con∣current reports of prisoners and deserters, who say
it was the news in the enemy's camp, that Fort Montgomery was taken; and one
man, a friend to government, who ar∣rived yesterday, mentions some
particulars of the manner in which it was taken.</P>
<P>The provisions of the army may hold out to the 20th; there is
neither rum nor spruce beer.</P>
<P>Having committed this state of facts to the consideration of
the council, the Gene∣ral requests their sentiments on the following
propositions.</P>
<P>1st. To wait in the present position an attack from the
enemy, or the chance of fa∣vourable events.</P>
<P>2d. To attack the enemy.</P>
<P>3d. To retreat repairing the bridges as the army moves for the
artillery, in order to force the passage of the ford.</P>
<P>4th. To retreat by night, leaving the artillery and the baggage;
and should it be found impracticable to force the passage with
musquetry, to attempt the upper ford, or the passage round Lake
George.</P>
<P><PB N="lvi" REF="202"/> In case the enemy, by extending to
their left, leave their rear open, to march rapidly for Albany.</P>
<P>Upon the first proposition resolved, that the situation
would grow worse by de∣lay, that the provision now in store not more than
sufficient for the retreat, should impediments intervene, or a circuit of
country become necessary; and as the enemy did not attack when the ground
was unfortified, it is not probable they will do it now, as they have a better
game to play.</P>
<P>The second unadvisable and desperate, there being no
possibility of reconnoi∣tering the enemy's position, and his great
superiority of numbers known.</P>
<P>The third impracticable.</P>
<P>The fifth thought worthy of consideration by the
Lieutenant-General, Major-General Phillips, and Brigadier-General Hamilton; but
the position of the enemy yet gives no opening for it.</P>
<P>Resolved, that the fourth proposition is the only
resource, and that to effect it, the utmost secrecy and silence is to
be observed; and the troops are to be put in motion from the right in the
still part of the night, without any change in the disposition.</P>
<P>N. B. It depended upon the delivery of six days provision in
due time, and upon the return of scouts, who had been sent forward to
examine by what route the army could probably move the first four miles
undiscovered, whether the plan should take place on that day, or on the
morrow.</P>
<P>The scouts on their return reported, that the enemy's
position on the right was such, and they had so many small parties out,
that it would be impossible to move without our march being immediately
discovered.</P>

<HEAD>Minutes and Proceedings of a Council of War, consisting
of all the general Officers and Field Officers, and Captains commanding Corps,
on the Heights of <HI>Saratoga, October</HI> 13.</HEAD>
<DIV4 TYPE="section">
<P>THE Lieutenant-General having explained the situation of
affairs, as in the pre∣ceding council, with the additional intelligence, that
the enemy was intrenched at the fords of Fort Edward, and likewise occupied
the strong position on the Pine∣plains between Fort George and Fort Edward,
expressed his readiness to undertake at their head any enterprise of
difficulty or hazard that should appear to them within the compass of their
strength of spirit. He added, that he had reason to believe a
capitulation had been in the contemplation of some, perhaps of all, who knew
the real situation of things; that upon a circumstance of such
consequence to national and personal honour, he thought it a duty to his
country, and to himself, to extend his council beyond the usual limits;
that the assembly present might justly be esteemed a full
representation of the army; and that he should think himself
unjusti∣fiable in taking any step in so serious a matter, without
such a concurrence of senti∣ments as should make a treaty the act of the
army, as well as that of the general.</P>
<P>The first question therefore he desired them to decide
was, Whether an army of 3500 fighting men, and well provided with artillery,
were justifiable, upon the principles of national dignity and military
honour, in capitulating in any possible situation?</P>
<P><PB N="lvii" REF="203"/> Resolved, nem. con. in the
affirmative.</P>
<P>Question 2. Is the present situation of that nature?</P>
<P>Resolved, nem. con. That the present situation
justifies a capitulation upon ho∣nourable terms.</P>
<P>The Lieutenant-General then drew up the message, marked
No. 2, and laid it before the council. It was unanimously approved, and upon
that foundation the treaty opened.</P>
<P>October 14. Major Kingston having delivered the message
marked No. 2. return∣ed with the proposals marked No. 3, and the council of
war being assembled again, the Lieutenant-General laid the proposals
before them, when it was resolved unani∣mously to reject the 6th article,
and not to admit of it in any extremity whatever.</P>
<P>The Lieutenant-General then laid before the council the
answers to Major-General Gates's proposals, as marked in the same paper,
together with his own preliminary proposals, which were unanimously
approved of.</P>
<P>October 15. The council being assembled again,
Major-General Gates's answers to Lieutenant-General Burgoyne's proposals
were laid before them, whereupon it was resolved, that they were
satisfactory, and a sufficient ground for proceeding to a definitive
treaty.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="2" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>No. 2. Major <HI>Kingston</HI> delivered the following
Message to Major-General <HI>Gates, October</HI> 14.</HEAD>
<P>AFTER having fought you twice, Lieutenant-General Burgoyne has
waited some days, in his present position, determined to try a third
conflict against any force you could bring to attack him.</P>
<P>He is apprised of the superiority of your numbers, and the
disposition of your troops to impede his supplies, and render his retreat
a scene of carnage on both sides. In this situation he is impelled by
humanity, and thinks himself justifiable by established principles and
precedents of state, and of war, to spare the lives of brave men upon
honourable terms. Should Major-General Gates be inclined to treat upon that
idea, General Burgoyne would propose a cessation of arms during the time
necessary to communicate the preliminary terms by which, in any extre∣mity,
he and his army mean to abide.</P>

<DIV1 TYPE="proposals and answers">
<P N="1">I. General Burgoyne's army being exceedingly
reduced by repeated defeats, by desertion, sickness, &amp;c. their
provisions exhausted, their military horses, tents, and baggage, taken or
destroyed, their retreat cut off, and their camp invested, they can only be
allowed to surrender prisoners of war.</P>
<P>Answer. Lieutenant-General Burgoyne's army, however
reduced, will never admit that their retreat is cut off, while they have arms
in their hands.</P>
<P N="2">II. The officers and soldiers may keep the
baggage belonging to them. The generals of the United States never permit
individuals to be pillaged.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="lviii" REF="204"/> III. The troops under
his Excellency General Burgoyne will be conducted by the most convenient
route to New England, marching by easy marches, and suf∣ficiently provided
for by the way.</P>
<P>Answer. This article is answered by General
Burgoyne's first proposal, which is here annexed.</P>
<P N="4">IV. The officers will be admitted on parole; may
wear their side-arms, and will be treated with the liberality customary in
Europe, so long as they, by proper behaviour, continue to deserve it; but
those who are apprehended having broke their parole, as some British
officers have done, must expect to be close confined.</P>
<P>Answer. There being no officer in this army under,
or capable of being under the description of breaking parole, this article
needs no answer.</P>
<P N="5">V. All public stores, artillery, arms,
ammunition, carriages, horses, &amp;c. &amp;c. must be delivered to
commissaries appointed to receive them.</P>
<P>Answer. All public stores may be delivered, arms
excepted.</P>
<P N="6">VI. These terms being agreed to and signed,
the troops under his Excellency General Burgoyne's command may be drawn up in
their encampments, where they will be ordered to ground their arms, and may
thereupon be marched to the river side, to be passed over in their way
towards Bennington.</P>
<P>Answer. This article inadmissible in any
extremity. Sooner than this army will consent to ground their arms in their
encampment, they will rush on the enemy, determined to take no quarter.</P>
<P N="7">VII. A cessation of arms to continue till
sun-set, to receive General Burgoyne's answer.</P>

the treaty ends at once.</P>

<P>QUESTION.</P>
<P>General Gates having, in answer to General Burgoyne's
message, given a solemn affirmation on his honour, that no detachment has
been made from his army during the negociation of the treaty, is the treaty, in
its present situation, binding on this army, or is the general's honour
engaged for the signing it?</P>
<P>[Here follow the names of the officers as they voted.]</P>
<P>The lieutenant general's opinion being clear, that he is not bound
by what has passed, he would not execute the treaty upon the sole
consideration of the point of honour, notwithstanding the respectable
majority against him.</P>
<P>He is likewise far from being convinced that this army, by great
exertions and by great enduring in point of provisions, might not yet be
relieved; but he is com∣pelled to yield on the following considerations.</P>
<P>The treaty was generally thought a most advantageous one before
the intelligence arrived. That intelligence is refuted, and ocular
demonstration of its falsity pledged as far as relates to General Gates's
force; the other parts are only founded on hearsay, and not to be depended
upon.</P>
<P>Should General Clinton be where reported, yet the distance is
such as to render any relief from him improbable during the time our
provisions could be made to last.</P>
<P>—declares his post untenable, and says, if this
convention is not signed, he apprehends there will be considerable
desertion.</P>
<P>—says he thinks the 47th regiment not to be depended
on.</P>
<P>—is of the same opinion.</P>
<P>—thinks the 62d regiment is disheartened by the
situation of their post, and not equal to their former exertions.</P>
<P>Several officers think the men in general seem to have got the
convention in their heads as desirable.</P>
<P>Many of the best officers are absent by sickness and
wounds from all the corps.</P>
<P>Though the other officers at the head of the British corps think
they can answer for the spirit of their men, if attacked on their present
ground, it is evident the most sanguine do not think any part of the army
in that elevation and alacrity of spirit ne∣cessary for undertaking
desperate enterprizes.</P>
<P>To break off the treaty now renders a future renewal of it
hopeless, as our condi∣tion must every hour grow worse.</P>
<P>A defeat is fatal to the army. A victory does not save it, as
they have neither provisions to advance nor retreat against an enemy who by
experience we know are capable of rallying at every advantageous post.</P>
<P>And that the life and property of every provincial and dependant
of this army depends upon the execution of this treaty.</P>

<HEAD>Extract of a Letter from Major General <HI>Phillips,</HI> to
Lieutenant General <HI>Burgoyne,</HI> dated <HI>Cambridge, September</HI> 29,
1778.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Boston news papers, have given extracts from English and
New York papers, wherein you are mentioned; your arrival, your speeches in
parliament; and a variety of other matters concerning you. I do not always give
credit to news papers, and therefore, the publishers at Boston will
excuse me, if in the in∣stance of news I do not give them, in my opinion,
more veracity than I allow the news compilers at London.</P>
<P>I will not plague you about our situation, as you will know
it, by my assuring you it is almost exactly as you left us; so no more
about it. The troops here de∣pend upon you their chief, in whatever may relate
to them; their interest; their honour. It is not doubted but you will exert
yourself, that the officers may gain preferment in common, with other parts
of the army. That you will have the goodness to exert yourself in behalf of
their situation, respecting the very great expence of living, and endeavour
to procure the allowance of forage money. And in short, that you will use
all your powers of persuasion and interest for these troops, which have
served under you with zeal, and with honour; and endeavour, by serving
their situation and promoting their honour, to alleviate misfortunes which
nor fortitude nor valour could prevent, and which they suffer, however, with
resignation and patience. I am most perfectly convinced of your
affectionate, I will say your grateful regard for us all; and I leave
myself and the troops to your friendly care; to your humanity; to your
honour.</P>
<P>You cannot expect a letter of entertainment; I have not even a
power of making it one of intelligence. It shall be however, a letter of
perfect sincerity, and in the fullest sense of it I profess to
be,</P>
<CLOSER>
<SALUTE>My dear Sir,</SALUTE>

<HEAD>Copy of a Letter from Lieutenant General <HI>Burgoyne</HI> to
Lord <HI>Amherst,</HI> inclosing the Memorial referred to in the above,
dated <HI>November</HI> 6, 1778.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE heavy misfortune I sustain in being precluded the King's
presence, touches me in no point more nearly, than in the prevention of doing
justice to the various and extensive merits of the army I had the honour to
command. That the con∣sequences of my supposed, or real errors, should
involve pretensions and interests of so many gallant officers is a
painful reflection; and it can only be alleviated by the truest sense of
the trust to be reposed in your Lordship, for the general protec∣tion of
the service. The inclosed memorial was accompanied with expressions of
reliance, in the name of the whole army, upon my efforts to support it. The
officers in New England little conceive my present situation: I take the
first oppor∣tunity to transmit their cause to your Lordship's happier
auspices, with this solemn declaration, which I have mentioned upon
different public occasions, and which I can omit no occasion to repeat,
that there is not a British officer who served under me during the campaign
of 1777, to whom I can impute blame; that the instances are very numerous
wherein particular distinction is due; and as a body, they have a claim to my
sincerest respect for their zeal in the King's service, and to my
utmost gratitude for their attention to me personally.</P>

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>In Plan IV. the third and fourth positions of the army in the
engagement of 19th of September may appear upon a cursory view to want
precision. The ine∣qualities of the ground could not be distinctly marked
upon so small a scale; and the continual shift of the positions of
separate corps, as they were attacked by corps of the enemy, which
frequently, from the thickness of the wood, they did not see, made it
equally difficult to mark regularly the position of the whole at any one
time.</P>
<P>The position of the armies on the 8th of September in Plate V.
requires also some explanation. From the smallness of the scale, the
position of the enemy could only be shewn upon the plain near the river;
but it is to be observed, it extended over the ground of General Burgoyne's
former encampment, and in front of the redoubts upon the hill.</P>
