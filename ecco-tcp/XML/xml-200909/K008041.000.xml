<HEAD>PROLOGUE.</HEAD>
<SP>
<STAGE>Spoken by Mr. KING.</STAGE>
<LG>
<L>THE Bard, whose Hopes on Comedy depend,</L>
<L>Must strive Instruction with Delight to blend;</L>
<L>While He, who bounds his less aspiring Views</L>
<L>To <HI>Farce,</HI> the <HI>Combrush</HI> of the <HI>comic</HI> Muse,</L>
<L>With Pleasantry alone may fill the Scene—</L>
<L>His Business chiefly this; to cure the Spleen;</L>
<L>To raise the pensive Mind from <HI>Grave</HI> to <HI>Gay,</HI></L>
<L>And help to laugh a thoughtful Hour away.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>If any quibbling Wit dispute my Thesis,</L>
<L>Pd ask the Use of half our <HI>petty Pieces?</HI></L>
<L>Nay, Sirs, My Question still shall higher climb—</L>
<L>Pray what's the Use of <HI>full-pric'd</HI> Pantomime?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>How does the pleasur'd Eye with Rapture glance</L>
<L>When mingling Witches join in <HI>hobbling</HI> Dance!</L>
<L>When wriggling <HI>Harlequin,</HI> the magic Sage,</L>
<L>In horn-pipe Amble traverses the Stage!</L>
<L>When trembling <HI>Pierrot</HI> in his Quivering shines,</L>
<L>An Ostrich enters, or a Serpent twines!</L>
<L>When <HI>headless</HI> Taylors raise the laughing Fit,</L>
<L>Or flour-dredg'd Footmen twirl upon a Spit!—</L>
<L>But oh! How loud the Roar, how dear the Rumble,</L>
<L>When Scaffolds, Mortar-Boards, and Bricklayers tumble!</L>
<L>When <HI>Clodpate</HI> runs, or limps, or quaintly rears</L>
<L>From Laundress-Tub his <HI>anabaptist</HI> Ears!</L>
<L>While all the Wit, these Exhibitions draw,</L>
<L>Is comprehended in a Cry—O <HI>Laa!</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Our Author, in this awful Court of <HI>Drury,</HI></L>
<L>Submits his Cause to an impartial Jury.</L>
<L>No friendly Junto he to-night employs</L>
<L>To catch, by <HI>favouring</HI> Hands, the public Voice:</L>
<L>He founds on <HI>British</HI> Candour all his Trust,</L>
<L>Convinc'd a <HI>British</HI> Audience will be Just.</L>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fran.</SPEAKER>
<P>WELL, this is the most unexpected Visit!— but prithee, <HI>Harwood,</HI> what in the Name of Mystery, hath brought thee to town at this unfashion∣able Time of the Year?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Loss of my fair Housekeeper.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fran.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Loss of <HI>Maria!</HI>—Is she dead?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>Worse, my dear <HI>Frankly</HI>—elop'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fran.</SPEAKER>
<P>Elop'd! Why I thought you had so great a Re∣gard for each other, that you had been as inseparable as old Age and Avarice, or a Coquette and a Looking-Glass.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>I thought so too: but Women are as changeable as their Dresses: there is no answering for the Humours of the Sex —tho' Faith I cannot altogether excuse myself in the Affair of our Parting.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fran.</SPEAKER>
<P>Prithee explain.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>You know, <HI>Charles,</HI> after the Death of my Wise, whom, with Shame I must own, I never thoroughly, lov'd, as she was not mine but my Father's Choice. I prevail'd on <HI>Maria,</HI> who was either beggar'd by an unnatural Fa∣ther or a villainous Uncle, to take upon her the Care of my Family. — Her good Sense, Beauty, and Behaviour, imperceptibly won my Heart; but my Pride forbidding me to marry a Woman without a Fortune, I made use of every Means in my Power to—gain her Affections.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fran.</SPEAKER>
<P>I understand you: to gain them in the old Way.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>
<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>But the fair <HI>Maria</HI> was so much upon her Guard, or so obstinately virtuous, that nothing but downright Matrimony would induce her to listen to my Sollicitations.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fran.</SPEAKER>
<P>An unreasonable Gipsy! And so you dropp'd the Affair?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not quite so hasty in your Conclusions, good Sir.—After a vast Profusion of lying and swearing, which fail'd of the desir'd Success, I determin'd to make my grand Attack.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fran.</SPEAKER>
<P>Resolv'd like a Man of Spirit!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>And accordingly one Night the last Week,
<Q><L>When ev'ry Eye was clos'd, and the pale Moon</L>
<L>And Stars alone shone conscious of the Theft,</L>
<L>Hot with the <HI>Gallic</HI> Grape, and high in Blood,</L></Q>and so forth, I began my Assault.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fran.</SPEAKER>
<P>Bravo!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>It would be needless to tell thee I was repuls'd. —In short, the dear, lovely, affronted, virtuous <HI>Maria,</HI> so highly resented the Familiarity, that she instantly left the House, and from that Hour I have not set Eye on the fair Enslaver.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fran.</SPEAKER>
<P>And so you are come to Town to hire a new Housekeeper?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>No; to marry my old one, if I can be so fortu∣nate as to encounter her.—I must have her!—I cannot be easy without her.—I have some faint Hopes of meet∣ing with her, as she was seen on the <HI>London</HI> Road.— Which do you think the most likely Way of finding her out?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fran.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hum!—this requires some thought—ay—Pray what do you think of a penitential Advertisement?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>No hang it! Should I be discovered for the Au∣thor, it would make me too ridiculous.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fran.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's true I must confess—stay—do you ima∣gine she will be looking after another Place?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>I fancy she will, as her Finances must below.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fran.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then the only Method I can put you into is an. Application to some of our Intelligence-Warehouses.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't understand your cant Phrase: Pray what: do you mean by an Intelligence-Warehouse?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fran.</SPEAKER>
<P>A Register-Office.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="7" REF="6" MS="y"/>
<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! I take you! the Places where Servants may be heard of.—Pray were not these Offices invented by the ingenious Author of <HI>Tom Jones?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fran.</SPEAKER>
<P>They were.—The Project hath been, and still is of great Utility to the Publick; but as there is no general Rule without an Exception, this laudable Institution hath been strangely perverted, thro' the Villainy and Avarice of some of it's Managers.—There is an old Rascal in this Neighbourhood, who hath amass'd a tolerable Fortune by Abuses of this Kind. His Office is frequented by Per∣sons of every Degree; and, among it's other Con∣veniences, the good old Trade of Pimping is carried on with great Success and Decency. I believe as many Proselytes have been made to the Flesh, by the Knavery of this Rascal, as by the most successful Bawd in Town.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>So, I find the old Fellow is a Genius in his Way?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fran.</SPEAKER>
<P>A complete one. — Our old School-fellow, <HI>Jack: Williams,</HI> is his Clerk, from which honourable Employ∣ment he retires in a few Days to a Stewardship, to which I have lately recommended him.—By his Means I have often had an Opportunity of overhearing some Passages, which have afforded great Humour and Entertainment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>If my Heart were not so full for the Loss of this dear Woman, I could like to throw away an Hour in an Amusement of this Kind.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fran.</SPEAKER>
<P>That you may this very Morning if you please— I'll introduce you — It will help to dissipate your Melan∣choly for the Loss of your fair Deserter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>Psha! I am not in a Humour to relish any Plea∣santry —excuse me, <HI>Charles</HI>—some other Time I'll ac∣cept of your Offer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fran.</SPEAKER>
<P>Since you are so serious, I must insist on your going — Why thou art as melancholy as a superseded Placeman—Come; come, <HI>George,</HI> don't despair! — I war∣rant we will find out <HI>it's</HI> Charmer in a few Days—You must go with me, <HI>Harwood.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then I am ready to attend you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fran.</SPEAKER>
<P>Allons donc. <STAGE>Exeunt.</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<STAGE><PB N="8" REF="7"/>Scene, a Register-Office.</STAGE>
<STAGE>Enter WILLIAMS.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Business of the Morning is partly over— What a croud of deluded Females have flock'd to this Office within these three Hours, in Expectation of the imaginary Place we have advertis'd! — A Register-Office, under the Direction of so conscientious a Person as Mr. <HI>Gulwell,</HI> instead of a publick Good, becomes a publick Evil—My upright Master seldom feels any Reflections of this Kind! Avarice is his leading Principle; and so long as he can swell his Bags, by the Folly or Credulity of Mankind, he will not suffer Conscience to hinder him in his Pursuit of Gain—Mr. <HI>Frankly!</HI> —à propos! I must have his Opinion of this Letter—'tis an Affair too serious to be conniv'd at.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Enter HARWOOD and FRANKLY.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fran.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. <HI>Williams,</HI> your Servant.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, your most obedient.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fran.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am come to ask the Favour of your giving this Gentleman an Opportunity of overhearing the Hu∣mours of the <HI>Register-Office.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, you could not impose on me a more welcome Command—Sir—I beg Pardon for my Freedom—if I mistake not I had the Honour of being your Schoolfel∣low —Your Name I think is <HI>Harwood?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is, Sir —I am very glad to see you, Mr. <HI>Wil∣liams.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come, Sir, this is no Time for Compliments: I expect my Master every Minute—there is your Way, Sir—you may see all that come in thro' the Blind—pray slip the Spring-Lock for fear of a Surprize from my mas∣ter—if he offer to unlock the Door, Mr. <HI>Frankly,</HI> you'll step into my Bedchamber —to your Posts, Gentlemen: I think I hear him coming. <STAGE>Exeunt Harwood and Frank∣ly.</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Enter GULWELL.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gul.</SPEAKER>
<P>So this Advertisement has brought in two Pounds thirteen shillings—no very bad Morning's Work—Well, thanks to the Memory of our witty Eounder, say I! Had he not luckily hit on the Scheme of a Register-Of∣fice,
<PB N="9" REF="8"/>I might have dangled on at Quill-driving without ever being worth a Groat.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, Sir, do you think this Calling of ours the most conscientious one in the World?—I begin to ima∣gine my old Employment the Law the more honest Pro∣fession of the two.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gul.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. <HI>Williams,</HI> there is Roguery in all the Em∣ployments under the Sun. Every Day's Experience will convince you, that there is no getting through the World without a necessary Portion of Trick and Chicanery.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, if the Imposture of this very Advertisement were sound out and duly punish'd, one or both of us would stand a fair Chance for the Pillory. How many poor Girls have this Morning been stripped of perhaps their last Shilling, by being amused with the Hopes of the Place we have advertised—In Faith, Sir, some of our Profession are little better than downright Pickpockets— I am glad I shall have the good Fortune to leave it so soon.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gul.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. <HI>Williams,</HI> I am truly sorry for our Separa∣tion, yet rejoice at the Occasion of it—however, if you hope to make a Fortune in your alter'd Condition of Life, you must learn to keep your Conscience in proper Subor∣dination. I can assure you, that Fraud is as necessary a Requisite in a Stewardship, as in an Intelligence-Office. — Is there no Message from Dr. <HI>Skinflint</HI> about the <HI>Welch</HI> Living?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Sir: he says as Curates are so cheap in <HI>Wales,</HI> he will not take less than a thousand Guineas.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gul.</SPEAKER>
<P>A spiritual Curmudgeon! Why it is not quite a hundred a Year—I forgot to ask if you call'd at Cap∣tain <HI>Sparkle</HI>'s last Night?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>I did, Sir, and was surprised to see him so great∣ly recover'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gul.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, I thought he would grow better after the Embarkation! I never supposed him in any very great Danger, because he refus'd eight hundred Guineas for his Commission, when his Life was said to be despair'd of — Have you finish'd the Assignment of the Surgeoncy?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gul.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then get it done, Mr. <HI>Williams</HI> — stay—you must write an Advertisement for the <HI>Daily</HI>—any Time
<PB N="10" REF="9"/>this Afternoon will do—of an Employment to be disposed of in <HI>Ireland</HI> of a thousand Pounds per Annum, which requires little Learning or Attendance, and may be exe∣cuted by a Deputy — Remember to add, that Secrecy is requir'd, and none but Principals need to apply.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>I forgot to tell you, the young Gentleman was here, to know if you had receiv'd an Answer about the Secretary's Place.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gul.</SPEAKER>
<P>Truly I am sorry I cannot succeed—Fifteen hun∣dred Guineas were insisted on—I pleaded the young Gen∣tleman's acknowledged Merit, and the publick Services of his brave Father, who lost his Life in fighting for his Country, which so softened my Principal, that he sunk his Demand from—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Fifteen to five hundred, I hope?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gul.</SPEAKER>
<P>From Guineas to Pounds: I could get no fur∣ther Abatement.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is a Pity that such extraordinary Merit should have no better Success.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gul.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! Mr. <HI>Williams,</HI> if Places were given to Per∣sons of Merit only, the Lord have Mercy upon many a big-looking Family—away! here's Company a coming! <STAGE>Exit Williams.</STAGE> Heyday! Who have we here? By his looks he must be one of the Tribe of the Soup Maigres!</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gul.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, if you be a Proficient in these Sciences, I give Joy with all my Heart, for I don't know a more profitable Calling in <HI>London:</HI> nay, nor a more reputable one; for it's Professors are caress'd by Persons of the first Fashion and Distinction — There's your Countryman Mon∣sieur <HI>Frizzellette de la Corneille,</HI> a Hair and Corn-Cutter in <HI>St. James</HI>'s, that keeps his Chariot, tho' 'tis scarce half a score Years since he would have made a Bow to the Ground for a Bellyfull of Soup-Maigre — Sir, I will cook you up an Advertisement, as long as a Proclamati∣on, that will effectually do your Business: In the mean Time I shall give Orders for one of the Laconic Kind, to hang in golden Letters over your Door, as <Q>Hair and Corns cut after the French Taste by a Person of Quality.</Q></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>French.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay dat vill do ver vel! Par une Personne de Qualité.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gul.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, Sir, as you are a Man of Rank, you may perhaps think it below your Dignity to follow any Pro∣fession, that has the least Appearance of Business?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>French.</SPEAKER>
<P>Non, non, Monsieur: tout au contraire.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gul.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then I dare venture to say, that in less than a dozen Years you will be rich enough to return to your native Country, and marry a Princess of the Blood—How in the Name of Wonder could you think of being a piti∣ful Teacher of <HI>French</HI> for a Livelihood, when you are possessed of Talents, superior to all the Learning in the World?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>French.</SPEAKER>
<P>Me vill tell you, Monsieur—It be not more as dix leven—douze—tirteen —ay tirteen Year, since mon Cousin com'd over to <HI>l' Angleterre</HI> to teash a de <HI>Frens</HI> in de Boarding-Ecole—Vell, he dit engager de Affection of de <HI>Angloise</HI> Lady, sa belle Ecoliere, runn'd avay vid her, and so begar he getted de Vife, vid not less as von hunder tousan Livres—Now, as mon Cousin could mar∣rier de Lady, vid so much of de l'Argent, vy may not me ope to do de same?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gul.</SPEAKER>
<P>True, Sir: but there's an ugly Act of Parlia∣ment since that Time, which hinders you Fortune-hunting
<PB N="12" REF="11" MS="y"/>Gentlemen from gaining such Wives—Well, Sir, you will deposit a small Sum; two or three Guineas or so, and I shall begin the Advertisement.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>French.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hey! vat you say! deposit!—Je ne entens pas deposit.</P>

<PB N="16" REF="15"/>

<P>It is in the Provinsh of <HI>Donegal,</HI> in the County of <HI>Ulster.</HI> It is an Inland Seaport Town, where they catch the best pickled Herrings in all <HI>England</HI>—By my set! he was the best Man of a Maishter between <HI>Derry</HI> and <HI>Youghal</HI> — Arra! I shall never live so well with nobody else, unless I go back to live with him again!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gul.</SPEAKER>
<P>As he was so good a Master, how came you to leave him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Irish.</SPEAKER>
<P>Leave him, Joy! Becase he wanted to make a <HI>Bug</HI> and a Fool of me. When I went to go to Plough and Harrow, he would insist on yoking the dear Creatures the Mulesh by the Necks, instead of the Tailsh.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gul.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Tails! Why, is that the <HI>Irish</HI> Custom in Ploughing?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Irish.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, upon my Conscience, it is, Joy! and the best Cushtom, that ever was born in the World — I'll give you a Reason for it, Honey — You know when the Trashes is sasten'd to the Tail, all the rest of the Body is free; and when all the Carcash but the Tail goes along, the Tail must shertainly follow it—Besides, Honey, all the World knows the Strength of every human Creature lies in the Tail—Arra! He wanted to <HI>bodder</HI> me with his dam <HI>English</HI> Tricks, but the Devil burn me, if honest <HI>Paddy</HI> would not have left twenty Plaishes, if he had been in them all at once, sooner than be put out of the Way of his Country!</P>

<P>Liv'd, Honey! As a great many lives in <HI>London;</HI> no body knows how—by my Shoul! I have only picked up five Thirteens for these four Weeks and a half!</P>

<P>Ay, my dear Honey; any way in <HI>England,</HI> or in <HI>Scotland;</HI> but I would not like, d'ye see, to live out of my native Kingdom.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gul.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! It's only a very short Voyage! A little round the Land's-End—A Gentleman hath taken a very considerable Farm in the West, and if I could prevail
<PB N="17" REF="16"/>on him to hire you, you would have the sole management of it—'Twould be the making of you—You can write, I suppose?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Irish.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, upon my Conscience, that I can very well!—My Mark, Honey; that's all—But that's Nothing, my dear; I could get any Body to write for me, if they did but know how.</P>

<P>And so should poor <HI>Paddy,</HI> by my set—You cannot conceive how my heart dances in the inside of my Bowelsh, to see a Relashon in this Part of the World, where I expected to see no body at all; — do, Honey, put your Head here to feel — fet, Joy, it beats, and beats, and beats, and jumps about in my Belly like a brustled Pea upon a red hot Fire-Shovel — Arra! I knew you to be better half an <HI>Irishman,</HI> by your Shivility to Strangers!</P>

<P>Ay, I wish I were wholly so! but it was my Mis∣fortune to be born in <HI>England.</HI></P>

<P>Upon my Conscience, that was almost poor <HI>Paddy</HI>'s Misfortune too! I was begot in <HI>England,</HI> but as good Luck would have it, I went over to <HI>Ireland</HI> to be born.</P>
</SP>

<P>Your Father! What was he?</P>

<P>A true <HI>Irish</HI> Poet, my dear; he could neither read nor write—By my set, Honey, he wrote many an excellent new Song—I have one of his uppn <HI>Moggy Maclachlan,</HI> a young Virgin in <HI>Sligo,</HI> who he fell in Love with, after she had two Love-Begots at one Time to Squire <HI>Concannen.</HI></P>

<P>The most consummate Rudeness in the World!—As I hope to be sav'd, Mr. <HI>Gulwell,</HI> the Mon∣ster had the Audacity, the immoderate Audacity, to make Love to me—ay, and in an honourable Way, I assure you!</P>

<P>Make Love to your Ladyship, I am astonished at the Rascal's Impudence?</P>

<STAGE>Enter HARWOOD and WILLIAMS.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis lucky that your Master was sent for, or we should have been terribly puzzled in getting <HI>Frankly</HI> out of the House.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Twas fortunate indeed!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>What an infamous Rascal he is! Such a Villain is enough to bring an Odium on the whole Fraternity of Office-Keepers—I hope they are not all like this Master of your's, Mr. <HI>Williams?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, they are not!—There are Persons, in this Way of Life, of as strict Honour and Integrity, as in any Profession whatever.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>A <HI>Register-Office,</HI> under the Managment of an honest Man, must certainly be very serviceable to the Publick?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Undoubtedly, Mr. <HI>Harwood</HI>—but the old Gentle∣man is crossing the Street—To your Post, Sir. <STAGE>Exit Harwood.</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Enter GULWELL.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gul.</SPEAKER>
<P>Her Ladyship hath releas'd me sooner than I ex∣pected—go, get the Instrument finish'd, Mr. <HI>Williams.</HI>— <STAGE>Exit Williams.</STAGE> <HI>[writing]</HI> A Comb-brush for Lady <HI>Vixen!</HI>—this I believe will be the one and twentieth, she hath had from my
<PB N="23" REF="22" MS="y"/>Office within these two Years—a special Customer i'faith!—Heyday! who have we here? A spruce Coxcomb of the Military Cast!</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Enter Captain Le BRUSH.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, your most obedient—Pray an't you Mr. <HI>Geofry Gullwell,</HI> Esquire?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gul.</SPEAKER>
<P>The same, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then I am come to have a little Talk with you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gul.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your Business, good Sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>You must know, Sir, I am an Ensign, in a new-rais'd <HI>Ridgmen,</HI> to which Post I was advance through the Interest of my very Good Friend and Acquaintance, Lord <HI>Pliant,</HI> whom I had the Honour to serve many Years in the Capacity of a Valet de Chambre — But, Sir, tho' formerly a Servant, I am a Gentleman born, and have had the Honour of a University <HI>Iddication.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gul.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, I make no Dispute of it: you have the Ap∣pearance of a Man of Consequence—May I crave your Name and Family?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Name, Sir, is <HI>Le Brush</HI>—I am commonly called <HI>Brush;</HI> but <HI>le Brush</HI> is the Name my Family was <HI>ariginally,</HI> nay even so lately as <HI>Harry</HI> the <HI>Eight,</HI> known by: a Name, Sir, given by Way of Distinction to one of my <HI>Auntsisters,</HI> that was General under <HI>All-afraid</HI> the Great, for so victoriously <HI>sweeping</HI> away <HI>hole</HI> Armies of the Enemy—Our Family had all their Estate <HI>consisti∣cated</HI> in the Broils between the <HI>Yorkshire</HI> and <HI>Lancashire</HI> Line, so that their <HI>Predecessors</HI> have been a little out of Repair to the present Time, and the Name <HI>regenerated</HI> into plain <HI>Brush.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gul.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, as your Family hath been so long reduced, how came you by the Education you talk of?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, I was taught to read and write <HI>free-gratis</HI> for nothing at a Charity School, and attended Lord <HI>Pli∣ant</HI> to the University, where you know there is many Opportunities for a Man of <HI>Talons</HI> to improve himself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gul.</SPEAKER>
<P>Right, Sir, such Opportunities, that I have fre∣quently known a Valet return from thence full as wise as his Master.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Egad, Sir, I see very plainly you're a Gentle∣man, that knows what's what.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="24" REF="23" MS="y"/>
<SPEAKER>Gul.</SPEAKER>
<P>And pray, Captain, what were your favourite Studies at College?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Logic and Poetry, the only two Studies sit for a Gentleman; as the first will teach you to cheat the De∣vil, and the last to charm the Ladies.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gul.</SPEAKER>
<P>I should be glad to have a little Conference with you on the latter, for I am a bit of a Dabler in it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then <HI>serously</HI> as a Friend, I would <HI>dissuade</HI> you to look out damn'd sharp, or upon my Soul you'll catch a Tartar! For I have not met with any Body, that was fit to hold the Candle to me in Poetry, for a long <HI>Serus</HI> of Time—But, Sir, as I am in haste, we had better refer the Dispute at prosent—any other Time I am at your Service for a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>—I shall run thro' my Business with as <HI>brief Prolixity</HI> as possible—At a Country Town, where I was Recruiting, I had the good Fortune to pick up a maiden Lady, pretty well stricken in Years, with a Fortune of three thousand Pounds in the Stocks. Now, Sir, as the Interest of the Money, and my present Pay will scarce be sufficient to maintain me — for you know, Sir, a Soldier and a Gentleman is <HI>anonymous</HI> Characters, and a Man in my Office must live up to his Dignity—I say, Sir, as the Interest of Mo∣ney is damn'd low, I have a Desire to purchase a Cornecy or a Company of Foot, that I may be better able to live like a Gentleman.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gul.</SPEAKER>
<P>Posts of this kind frequently fall under my Dis∣posal. I think it a prudent and honourable Intention in you; as, in case of Mortality, the Provision for your Lady will be larger.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pho! Dam the old Hag! I don't care if the Devil had her: I have been married above two Months, and was as tired of her in the first Fortnight, as a mo∣dern Man of Quality after a Twelve-month's Cohabita∣tion I have, for these five Weeks past, done every thing in my Power to break her Heart; but egad it is made of such tough Stuff, such <HI>penctrable</HI> Stuff, as my Friend <HI>Shakespear</HI> calls it, that I believe I shan't be able to <HI>defect</HI> the Business, damme!—In short, my Disappointment hath thrown me into such a hellish <HI>Deel ha me,</HI> that the Devil fetch me if I know, for the Blood and Soul of me, how
<PB N="25" REF="24" MS="y"/>to <HI>execrate</HI> myself out of it! For I want to be rid of her most cursedly that's certain.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gul.</SPEAKER>
<P>There are Ways—many Ways, Captain, by which such a Business may be brought about.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>True, Sir My Serjeant <HI>Tom Spaterdash,</HI> who is a damn'd <HI>cute</HI> Dog, as any in the <HI>Coppercan</HI> System — You don't know <HI>Tom?</HI> do you, Sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gul.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can't say I have the Honour of his Acquain∣tance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! the most archest, comicalest Son of a Whore in the whole Universe egad! — As I was a saying, <HI>Tom</HI> offered me for ten Pieces to give her a Dose; but no, no; damme thinks I to myself, I'll not poison the old Beldam neither! It will be the more <HI>fashionable</HI> Way to break her Heart.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gul.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, as you are a Gentleman, I would beg leave to ask why you are so desirous of parting with a Woman, who hath been so great a Benefactress to you — I should be afraid your Patron and his Lady would resent such Behaviour—Will you be kind enough to answer my Question with Truth?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Truth, Sir, is to be sure a most <HI>amable</HI> Thing, and what every Gentleman ought to make Use of. As Mr. — what's his Name? — One of the old <HI>Roman</HI> Philosophers there—<HI>Pythogorus,</HI> I believe — Ay Squire <HI>Pythogorus</HI> it was—used to say, <HI>Sockratas</HI> is my Friend, <HI>Pluto</HI> is my Friend, but Truth is more my Friend. So say I, Lord <HI>Pliant</HI> is my Friend, Lady <HI>Pliant</HI> is my Friend, but Truth is more my Friend — And tho' some Persons will affirm that Truth ought not to be spoken at all Times; yet no Philosopher, not no body else, would ever venture to affirm, but that Truth ought to be spoken at sometimes—which being granted—I say, Sir, which being granted, it must follow—necessarily fol∣low. Sir, — that tho' Truth ought not to be spoken at all Times, Occasions, and Seasons; yet seasonable Truths may be occasionally spoken at all Times—But this, Sir, is the very Profundity of Logic, and consequently out of the Reach of <HI>every</HI> Capacity, wherefore I shall descend into the <HI>Spear</HI> of common Sense to be the better under∣stood.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="26" REF="25" MS="y"/>
<SPEAKER>Gul.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, I must acknowledge that your Arguments are very Sublime and Logical; but yet they are no An∣swer to my Question—Perhaps I have been too rude to press you on the Occasion — there may be some <HI>Lady</HI> in the Case, who—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Egad! Sir, you're in the Right! I had not been Married above ten Days; till I fell most <HI>consumedly</HI> in Love with a Niece of my Wise's, a Girl of Fifteen with a damn'd large Fortune—a most exquisite Creature upon my Soul!—In short, She is all the <HI>hole Tote</HI> of my Desires—As that there black <HI>Fellar</HI> in the Play—<HI>Othello Moor</HI> I think they call him — says, <HI>Perdition catch my Soul but I do Love her: and when I Love her not</HI> Chaos <HI>is come again!"</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gul.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray, Captain, who is that <HI>Chaos?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Chaos!</HI> Lard bless you!—You <HI>pertend</HI> you don't know! A Man of your Years and Understanding too! Fie! Fie! Mr. <HI>Gulwell!</HI> None of your Tricks upon Travellers!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gul.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, I seldom ask the Meaning of a Word I un∣derstand.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then you must know <HI>Chaos</HI> is a—my dear, it is a—a—a— zounds I What shall I say?—The Devil <HI>Cha∣os</HI> him—It is a—I can't find Words to express myself properly—It is a—as it were a—as one may say a—<HI>Chaos.</HI> I can't <HI>divine</HI> it otherwise for the Blood and Soul of me!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gul.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have not <HI>divin'd</HI> it at all; at least not to my Satisfaction—I suppose by the Connexion it signifies Dis∣like?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cap.</SPEAKER>
<P>Right Sir, it is a—a—kind of Dislike, but not, as one may say, a—a—an absolute Dislike—But, Sir, to <HI>proceed</HI> in my Story—If I could but break my Wife's Heart, I should assuredly marry my Niece in less than a Month after her Decease — A <HI>seprate Maintainance</HI> won't do, or Mrs <HI>Le Brush</HI> should have it with all my Soul but if we part, you know all Hopes of breaking her Heart are over—She hath offered to <HI>seprate,</HI> if I would give her two hundred Pounds in ready <HI>Rhino,</HI> and al∣low her for Life an annual Provision of fifty Pounds <HI>per Annum</HI> every Year —.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gul.</SPEAKER>
<P>Which you have refused, I suppose?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="27" REF="26"/>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Refused! Most certainly, Sir: I was almost <HI>pu∣trified</HI> with Astonishment at the <HI>agregious</HI> Impudence of her Demand—I shall not consent to allow here a Shilling more as Fifteen a Year—She may live very comfortably; very comfortably on it in the <HI>North.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gul.</SPEAKER>
<P>Truly, Sir, I think fifteen Pounds a Year a very genteel Allowance; especially as she brought you so small a Trifle as Three Thousand.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think so too egad! But these old Devils have no Conscience at all damme! — Well, Sir, you'll give me an Answer as soon as possible—You may hear of me at Mrs. <HI>Dresden</HI>'s, a Milliner under the <HI>Peeaches,</HI> in <HI>Com∣mon-Garden.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gul.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>(writing)</HI> Very well, Sir—I'll talk with a Prin∣cipal about your Affair this Evening.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>There Sir—<HI>[gives him Money]</HI> You'll take Care to beat him down as low as possible?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gul.</SPEAKER>
<P>You may depend on my best Endeavours, most noble Captain. <STAGE>Exit Captain Le Brush.</STAGE> Scoundrel I should have said — Why this Fellow's a greater Rascal than myself—But what can be expected from a Coxcomb of his Stamp?—More Company!— In a Chair too! — I fancy this must be my dear Sister in Wickedness.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Enter Mrs. SNAREWELL in a Chair.</STAGE>
<P>Dear Mrs. <HI>Snarewell,</HI> your most obedient—Let me hand you to a Seat, Madam.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Snare.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! Oh! Oh! Touch me gently, Mr. <HI>Gul∣well.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gul.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am glad to see you Abroad again. <HI>(kisses her)</HI> I hear you have had a very bad Night.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Snare.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! The most shocking one, that can be ima¦gined! The <HI>Chelic,</HI> and my old cursed Distemper the <HI>Rheumatise,</HI> have plagued me to so violent a Degree, that I could not possibly attend your Office in Time—Such Twitchings! Such Tortures!—I never expected to live 'till Morning, I assure you — Poor Mr <HI>Watchlight,</HI> the Tallow Chandler, was called twice out of Bed to com∣fort me—The dear Man was so servent in his Prayers, and so earnest in his Ejaculations, that I received great Comfort and Consolation—I was so Easy, so Composed, so Resigned after I had made my Peace, that I could
<PB N="28" REF="27"/>have parted with Life with as little Uneasiness, as a young Wife of Quality with her <HI>Deary</HI> of Threescore—Oh! he's a most <HI>Heavenly</HI> Creature!—He said such com∣fortable <HI>moving</HI> Things!—But what Success had the Advertisement?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gul.</SPEAKER>
<P>Beyond Expectation! I had above fifty Damsels with me—You might have cull'd half a Dozen at least, that would have answer'd to a T: such fresh blooming Creatures!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Snare.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Devil's in my Luck to be sure!—Ay! Ay! he owes me a Grudge for turning <HI>Methodist</HI> — I have been cursing my Fortune in Bed these three Hours—so violently pain'd, so tortur'd, that I could not rise tho' my Life had depended on it — I am certainly the most un∣fortunate Woman alive! The Reputation of my House will be utterly blasted for want of <HI>fresh</HI> Faces!— O this cursed <HI>Rheumatise!</HI> that it should seize me at such a Juncture!—I could cry my Eyes out to think on't! <STAGE>weeps.</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gul.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear Madam, be comforted, I shall have many of them applying To-morrow to know their Success.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Snare.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>To-morrow!</HI> But that won't answer my Pur∣pose: I have promised a Virgin to Mr. <HI>Zorobabel Habak∣kuk</HI> to Night.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gul.</SPEAKER>
<P>You must palm some of your <HI>freshest Commodi∣ties</HI> on him for one.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Snare.</SPEAKER>
<P>Palm some of your <HI>freshest Commodities,</HI> quotha! Mr. <HI>Gulwell</HI> you are vastly mistaken in your Man!— He is too <HI>knowing</HI> in these Matters to be imposed on in any such Manner — It would be as difficult to deceive my little <HI>Israelite</HI> in that <HI>Point,</HI> as a Jury of Matrons — Be∣sides, he pays the Price of Virginity; and I assure you I am a Person of more Honour and Conscience, than even to <HI>endeavour</HI> to fob him off with a Counterfeit — Con∣science should be used in all our Dealings — I have too strong a Sense of Religion to be guilty of such a <HI>heinous</HI> Imposture—No, no, Mr. <HI>Gulwell!</HI> if we expect to be Happy hereafter, we must endeavour to do as we would be done by—Is there never a likely Girl you expect at the Office to Day?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gul.</SPEAKER>
<P>None that I know of — But pray how stands the Account for the <HI>Irish</HI> Lady, you had the last Week?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="29" REF="28"/>
<SPEAKER>Snare.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Sir, I could not squeeze a Penny more than ten Guineas from the old close listed <HI>Scrivener,</HI> so that I owe you Five — Upon my Soul, Mr. <HI>Gulwell,</HI> you must abate of your Demands for the future! The Expences of a Bagnio run so high, that I cannot afford you an equal Moiety of my Procuration — There's Rent, Taxes, Sesses, Repairs, Fire, Candle, Linen, Washing, Cloaths, <HI>Connivance-Money,</HI> and a thousand other ex∣pensive Articles — I can give you no more than a fourth Part: I can afford you no more, as I hope to be sav'd!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gul.</SPEAKER>
<P>Madam, I can do Business, on my present Terms, with any of the Procuresses in Town.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Snare.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! you're a covetous Curmudgeon! but there is no quarrelling with you Well, I must be go∣ing! I have promised Mr. <HI>Watchlight</HI> to be at the Ta∣bernacle, to return Thanks for my Recovery—He will preach a <HI>Thanksgiving</HI> Sermon, and Sing an <HI>occasional</HI> Hymn of his own composing after the Discourse — Here it is! I have been humming it over in the Chair—O they are sweet Words! divine Words! comfortable Words, Mr. <HI>Gulwell!</HI> — You shall hear two or three Lines.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gul.</SPEAKER>
<P>With all my Heart, Madam.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Snare.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let me see where shall I begin!—Oh here! <STAGE>read!</STAGE>
<Q><L>When as a Sinner groaning sore</L>
<L>In <HI>Cholic Pain</HI> most sad;</L>
<L>And eke in <HI>Rheumatise</HI> did roar</L>
<L>Like one quite <HI>raving</HI> mad:</L>
<L>Then did their come Relief—</L></Q>But you shall have it some other Time: I will get Mr. <HI>Watchlight</HI> to write you out a Copy—Oh! he's a good Creature, Mr. <HI>Gulwell</HI>—I must have been in a State of utter Darkness but for him—I can never be out of his Debt for the great Work of my Reformation—It is true I have left him, in token of my Gratitude, all my worldly Substance, except Rings and Mourning to you and a few Friends — Dear Man! He hath promised to lay it out, even to the uttermost Farthing, in building a new Tabernacle.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="30" REF="29"/>
<SPEAKER>Gul.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope, Madam, you have not disinherited your two Daughters?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Snare.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why I had some Scruples on that Head, but Mr. <HI>Watchlight</HI> remov'd them — He told me, as they were <HI>Illegitimate,</HI> it would be a great Slur and Reproach to my Reputation, if I named them in my Will: and you know one would wish to die with a <HI>good Name</HI>—Besides, he convinced me of the exceeding great Sinfulness of leaving any Thing to Bastards, as it was a <HI>direct</HI> Countenance and Encouragement to the Cause of Lewdness and Debauchery — He assured me that many good Men, in all Ages, had disinherited even their <HI>lawful</HI> Children, for the <HI>charitable</HI> Work of build∣ing Hospitals and Alms Houses—and if there be <HI>such</HI> Me∣rit in building an Hospital, what must there be in erecting a <HI>Tabernacle?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gul.</SPEAKER>
<P>Here's Religion with a Vengeance! <STAGE>aside.</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Snare.</SPEAKER>
<P>Besides, my Daughters are both very <HI>happily</HI> provided for. <HI>Sukey</HI> is in keeping with a rich <HI>Jew,</HI> and <HI>Lucy</HI> with a grave <HI>Merchant</HI> in the City—Poor Girls! They have no Occasion for any Assistance from me— No, no; Mr. <HI>Watchlight</HI> hath perfectly satisfied me of the <HI>Lawfulness</HI> of Disinheriting them—Oh! he's a good Creature, Mr. <HI>Gulwell!</HI>—I should have been Lost! utterly Lost! irrecoverably Lost! if he had not been luckily made the Means and Instrument of my happy Change — Well, I shall be with you in the Morning to take a Survey; in the mean Time if you meet with any delicate <HI>young Thing,</HI> be sure to give me Notice — Oh! Oh! Oh!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gul.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray what's the Matter, Madam?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Snare.</SPEAKER>
<P>A Return of my late Disorder — Have you no <HI>Holland's</HI> Gin in your Scrutore?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gul.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I have always a Bottle for the Service of the Ladies. <STAGE>Takes out a Bottle and Glass.</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Snare.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hold! hold! hold! I would not have above a Thimbleful — Mercy on me! You surely think I have the Brain of a Country Justice, to bear such a Glass in a Morning!</P>

<PB N="31" REF="30"/>
<SPEAKER>Snare.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thank you, dear Sir—But I am persuaded I cannot live long—You had better give me the Bottle: my Hand shakes so violently, that I am afraid of spil∣ling, if I drink out of the Glass—It would be a Pity to waste the <HI>good Creature.</HI> — Come, Sir, Success to all our Undertakings. <STAGE>Drinks out of the Bottle.</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gul.</SPEAKER>
<P>I thank you, Madam—So! the Thimbleful will be half a Pint at least!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Snare.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Mr. <HI>Gulwell,</HI> as I was saying I am per∣suaded I cannot live long—I feel the Decays of Nature in me very sensibly! I am wasting and wasting every Day—I must entirely give over my wicked Life, and wholly apply myself to the Care of my precious and immortal Soul—I am grown so <HI>Feeble</HI> and <HI>Infirm,</HI> that I am almost unfit for this World—Oh! Oh! Oh! — there's another envious Twitch—Pray hand me the Bottle —I must have t'other Thimbleful—Thank you, Mr. <HI>Gulwell</HI>—Chairman! <STAGE>(Enter Chairmen who help her into the Chair.)</STAGE> Carry me to the <HI>Tabernacle</HI>—Dear Sir, your Servant.</P>

This is the Curse of marrying a <HI>Tradesman</HI>'s Daughter for the Sake of her Fortune!

<P>My Lord, I have frequently Bargains of this Kind under my Negotiation: I could help you to one about the Mark, but would not advise you to it, on ac∣count of it's extravagant Price.

</SP>
<SP>

<P>Sir, it is not in <HI>Williams</HI>'s Power to do you any Injury in the Affair: he was not privy to the Fraud of your Brother-in-law's signing a <HI>counterfeit</HI> Will, but on∣ly called hastily in to witness the Signature. The other Evidence is dead, therefore there is no Danger from that Quarter—Don't be afraid, Mr. <HI>Tricket;</HI> I'll answer for the Validity of the Will—I thought you had known the Law better in these Cases, than to be afraid of such a Bug-bear as a Chancery Suit!</P>

<P>First then I must desire you to forgive the Cause of your quitting my House: in the next Place, that you will return with me to <HI>Somersetshire;</HI> not in the Capacity of a Housekeeper, but a Wife—Don't imagine the Re∣covery of your Fortune hath induced me to this Proposal— Mr. <HI>Frankly</HI> can convince you the sole lntent of my Journey to Town was to marry you.</P>

<P>Fortunate for me indeed! And were I not fully convinced of the great Service, arising to the Commu∣nity, from the Institution and proper Management of a <HI>Register-Office,</HI> I should be apt to conclude, from the Trick, Villainy, and Chicanery I have seen practised within this Hour, that none but a <HI>Fool</HI> or a <HI>Knave</HI> would ever set foot within it's Walls. <STAGE>Exeunt.</STAGE></P>

<P>As there is a <HI>palpable Similarity</HI> between the Characters of Mrs. COLE in the <HI>Minor,</HI> and Mrs. SNAREWELL in the foregoing Performance; it may not be unnecessary to declare, that the <HI>Register-Office</HI> was put into Mr. <HI>Foote</HI>'s Hands in <HI>August</HI> 1758, on his Promise of playing it at one of the Patent-Theatres in the ensuing Season.</P>
