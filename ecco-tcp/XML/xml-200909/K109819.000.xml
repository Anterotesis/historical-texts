<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> Am sensible that this Performance will come into the World much more imperfect than I at first thought it would. But I have la∣bour'd under so many Difficulties in the compiling of it, that when but a few of them are mentioned, I hope for a candid and favourable Judgment.</P>
<P>AFTER I had collected in private what Materials I could, I was then obliged to go publickly in Quest of more. Upon this I publish'd an <HI>Advertisement,</HI> desiring the Assistance of such as had ancient Writings, or Deeds, or any other Things that might contribute to the helping of the Work.</P>
<P>THIS immediately, occasioned the following Reflecti∣ons, that it might be of dangerous Consequence to shew ancient Writings, that He was but a Curate that under∣took the Work, that his Abilities therefore of Pocket and
<PB N="vi" REF="8"/>
Mind must be vastly unequal to such a Task; in short, above 12 Months before the Publication of it, some have made it their Business, (so great has been their Ill-nature and Prejudice) as to take all Ways and Methods of decry∣ing it; by Print, by Manuscript, lessening it in all Com∣panies to hinder it's Publication, and speaking as freely of of it, as if they were acquainted with every Line of it's Composition, and by a Prophetick Spirit knew it to be as they talk'd of it.</P>
<P>BY these Means I am certain I have been hindred of many Materials.</P>
<P>BUT there are two grand Disappointments I met with in the Compiling of this Performance, which must not be untaken Notice of. The One is my not being so happy as to see Dr. <HI>Ellison</HI>'s Collection of the Antiquities of this Town. A few indeed were sent me, but having the same Copy from Mr. <HI>Douglas,</HI> they were of no Service; and excepting these I saw no more. 'Tis to be hoped, as the Dr. must have made a large Collection, having been about it, as is said, for many Years; that the present Possessor of them will oblige the Town with the Publication of Them, and cure the Imperfections of the present Performance.</P>
<P>THE other Disappointment is the not Meeting with those large Collections of Sir <HI>Robert Shaftoe,</HI> taken No∣tice of by Bishop <HI>Nicholson</HI> in his <HI>English Historical Library.</HI> I endeavoured after a Sight of them, but they were then either lost, or so mislaid, that there was no coming at them.</P>
<P>AND if I add to all this, an Illness of many Months, and which it pleases God still to continue, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Author did live but few Months after he wrote this Preface, dying <HI>Feb. 16. 1732.</HI></NOTE> which too fre∣quently obliges me to trust the Copies of others, and de∣pend upon them, I hope a few Errours and Failings will fall gently to my Share.</P>
<P><PB N="vii" REF="9"/>HOWEVER in the midst of all this Malice and Ill-nature and these Disappointments, there were some so communicative, and generously assisting, as to give all the Help they could. They are the Gentlemen following.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>MR. JOSUAH DOUGLAS, who assisted me with a great Number of Materials.</ITEM>
<ITEM>JOHN MILBANK, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> who sent me a Manuscript which is frequently mentioned.</ITEM>
<ITEM>CHRSTOPHER HUNTER of <HI>Durham,</HI> M. D. who has obliged me in the kindest Manner, with several curious Manuscripts which are acknowledged in their proper Pla∣ces.</ITEM>
<ITEM>The Rev. Mr. SMITH of <HI>Melsonby,</HI> who sent me a Book of antient Deeds and Charters copy'd from one in <HI>Ʋniver∣sity College</HI> in <HI>Oxford,</HI> relating to some Lands in this Town.</ITEM>
<ITEM>JOHN THORNTON, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> of <HI>Nether-witton,</HI> who o∣bliged me with a Sight of some ancient Writings, parti∣cularly the Will of his famous Ancestor <HI>Roger de Thornton.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>ROBERT SHAFTO, of <HI>Benwall,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> who contribu∣ted some ancient Writings, particularly One relating to the Chanteries of the Churches of this Town.</ITEM>

<HEAD>The following Gentlemen have also been very kind and ready in assisting me with Books, Transactions, Modern Papers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>

<P>IT will neither be necessary nor proper for me at this Time to answer the trifling Objections above-mention'd. I shall therefore only add, that I have spared no Pains; but that as in my Health I laid out all my Endeavours, in the Collecting of Materials from all Quarters I could pos∣sibly come at any, so I have now finish'd it according to the best of my Abilities and Judgment.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. I.</HI> Some Account of the Roman Walls in the Country of the <HI>OTTADINI;</HI> particularly the Walls of <HI>HADRIAN</HI> and <HI>SEVERUS,</HI> which went through this TOWN. The most ancient Name of this TOWN.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>T was about an hundred Years after the Landing of <HI>Julius Caesar</HI> in <HI>this Island,</HI> when the <HI>Brigantes,</HI> a popu∣lous and warlike Nation of the <HI>Britains,</HI> whose Coun∣try extended from the North of <HI>Humber</HI> to the River <HI>Tyne,</HI> containing the present Counties of <HI>Yorkshire, Dur∣ham, Lancashire, Westmoreland,</HI> and <HI>Cumberland,</HI> were first assaulted by the <HI>Romans.</HI> The <HI>Britains</HI> behaved themselves in the War with great Courage and Reso∣lution, 'till at last, in the Reign of <HI>Vespasian,</HI> the great∣est Part of them were conquered. After this in the Reign of <HI>Titus, Julius A∣gricola,</HI> the Lieutenant of <HI>Britain,</HI> who was at least equally Famous for his Conquests over the Customs and Manners of the <HI>Britains,</HI> as for his many Victories over them in Battle, did in the third Year of his Lieutenancy make a Discovery of other Parts of this Island, which were not brought under the <HI>Roman</HI> Yoke. Upon which he marched Northward into the Country of the <HI>Ottadini,</HI> which extends from the North of <HI>Tyne</HI> to the River <HI>Taus,</HI> wa∣sting and destroying all before him, 'till he came to the <HI>Tay</HI> it self. And now according to some was the first Wall made in <HI>Britain:</HI> But it was not pro∣perly
<PB N="2" REF="13"/>
a Wall, it was only a Line of Garrisons placed upon that Slip of Land between <HI>Edinburgh-Frith</HI> and <HI>Dun-Britain-Frith,</HI> for the Security of what they had already gain'd; and if the Valour of <HI>Agricola</HI>'s Army, and the Renown of the <HI>Roman</HI> Name could have suffer'd it, there was no Need of a further Search after the Bounds and Limits of <HI>Britain.</HI> The <HI>Friths</HI> above-mentioned, called then <HI>Glota</HI> and <HI>Bodotria,</HI> might have been very sufficient, being the Arms of two opposite Seas, and only separated by a small Space of Land, which was well fortified with the <HI>Roman</HI> Garrisons; so that the <HI>Romans</HI> were Lords of the whole South, and had cast the Enemy as it were into another Island <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Tacit. in vit. Agricol.</NOTE>. But what could ever bound the Roman Glory, and limit their ne∣ver satisfied Ambition? It was not enough that they had intirely secured them∣selves for any Attempts of the <HI>Caledonians,</HI> but <HI>They</HI> also were to be subdued. This was effected in the 8th Year of <HI>Agricola</HI>'s Lieutenancy in the reign of <HI>Domitian.</HI></P>
<P>HOWEVER after this, <NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Cambd.</NOTE> that further Part of the Island was left to the <NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">The inha∣bitants went naked, had no Houses to live in, nei∣ther did they Till the Ground. As one writeth, <HI>de praeda &amp; venatione, Frondibus{que} Arborum vi∣vant, degent in Tentoriis Nudi &amp; sine calceis.</HI> Grey ex Xiphilin'.</NOTE> <HI>Barbarians,</HI> as neither Pleasant nor Fruitful; but this nether Part was fairly reduc'd to a <HI>Roman</HI> Province; which was not governed by Consular, or Pro∣consular Deputies; but was counted Praesidial, and appropriate to the <HI>Cae∣sars,</HI> as being a Province annex'd to the Empire, after the Division of Pro∣vinces made by <HI>Augustus,</HI> and having <HI>Propraetors</HI> of its own.</P>
<P><HI>HADRIAN,</HI> who was made Emperor about the Year of our Lord 117, made the second Wall. <NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">Cambd.</NOTE> He drew a Wall, says <HI>Spartian,</HI> of eighty Miles in Length, to divide the Barbarians from the <HI>Romans;</HI> which one may gather, from what follows in <HI>Spartian,</HI> to have been in the Fashion of a <HI>Mural Hedge</HI> of large Stakes, fix'd deep in the Ground, and fastned together with Wattles. The same Authority from the Scotch Historian who wrote the <HI>Rota Temporum,</HI> tells us, that <HI>Hadrian</HI> did first of all draw a Wall of a prodigious Bigness, made of Turf (of that Height that it look'd like a Mountain, and with a deep Ditch before it) From the Mouth of the <HI>Tyne</HI> to the River <HI>Eske,</HI> i. e. from the <HI>German</HI> to the <HI>Irish</HI> Ocean. This is supposed to have been done about the Year 123.</P>
<P>THE <NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg">Cambd.</NOTE> Third Wall was built by <HI>Lollius Urbicus,</HI> Lieutenant of Britain, un∣der <HI>Antoninus Pius,</HI> about the Year 144, who by his great Success removed back the Bounds to where <HI>Julius Agricola</HI> had set them, and raised a Wall there.</P>
<P>THE <NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">Cambd.</NOTE> Fourth Wall was that of <NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg">This Empe∣ror died at <HI>York</HI> about the Year <HI>211,</HI> Feb. 4th.</NOTE> <HI>Severus,</HI> which was built about the Year of Christ 210, which extended from Sea to Sea, quite cross the Island. This was a Wall of Stone, built much about the same Place where the Wall of <HI>Hadrian</HI> was. It had it's Beginning at <HI>Bulness</HI> on the <HI>Irish</HI> Sea, and crossing the Island, went as far as <HI>Walls-End,</HI> a Village about 3 Miles East of <HI>Newcastle.</HI></P>
<P>A <NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg">Cambd.</NOTE> Fifth Wall was built between the two Arms or Bosoms of the Seas for many Miles together, that where the Waters did not defend them, the Wall might be a Security against the Incursions of the Enemy. This Wall was made by <HI>Carausius,</HI> Governour of <HI>Britain,</HI> in the Reign of <HI>Dioclesian,</HI> and stood in the same Place where <HI>Lollius Urbicus</HI> had built his.</P>
<P>THIS being finished, the <HI>Romans</HI> left the <HI>Britains</HI> to their own Valour and Conduct, being called away for the Defence of <HI>Gaul;</HI> But no sooner were they gone, than their Enemies returned, and slew all before them: Up∣on this they sent Ambassadors to <HI>Rome</HI> to sollicite the Assistance of the <HI>Ro∣mans,</HI> which was granted them. For <HI>Valentinian</HI> sent three Companies under the Conduct of <HI>Gallio</HI> of <HI>Ravenua,</HI> who routed the Enemy and relieved the Province. After this <NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg">Cambd. p. 86. <HI>ex Gild'.</HI></NOTE> they made a Wall of Stone (not raised at the pub∣lick and private Costs, as the other was) with the Help of the poor Natives, built after the usual Manner, quite cross the Country from one Sea to ano∣ther, by those Cities which were perhaps built there for fear of the Enemy: They exhorted them to be couragious, and left them Patterns to make their Weapons by. Upon the Southren Shore of <HI>Britain</HI> also, where their Ships
<PB N="3" REF="14"/>
lay, (because the barbarous Enemy might enter there) they built <HI>Turrets</HI> at some Distance from one another, that lookt a long Way to the Sea. And so the <HI>Romans</HI> intending never to return more, about the Four Hundred Seventy Sixth Year from the coming of <HI>Julius Caesar,</HI> took their last Farewell.</P>
<P>THIS last Wall, according to <HI>Bede,</HI> was eight Foot broad and twelve Foot high, and stood in the Place where the Walls of <HI>Hadrian</HI> and <HI>Severus</HI> had stood. <NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg">Cambd.</NOTE> It had great Number of Towers or little <HI>Castles,</HI> a Mile one from another, called now <HI>Castlesteeds;</HI> and on the Inside a Sort of <HI>fortified little Towns</HI> call'd <HI>Chesters.</HI> The Inhabitants tell you there was also a <HI>Brazen Trum∣pet</HI> or <HI>Pipe,</HI> (whereof they now and then find Pieces) so artificially laid in the Wall between each <HI>Castle</HI> and Tower, that upon the Apprehension of Dan∣ger at any single Place, by the sounding of it, Notice might be given to the next, then to the Third, and so on.</P>
<P>THESE are all the Walls of the <HI>Romans;</HI> and that three of them went through this Town is something more than probable. For <HI>Severus</HI>'s Wall was in the Place of <HI>Hadrian</HI>'s, and the last Wall mentioned, in the Place of <HI>Severus</HI>'s, and that last Wall went through this Town. Mr. <HI>Camden</HI> is so sure of this, that he declares, <HI>'Tis most certain that the Rampier, and afterward the Wall passed through this Town; and that at</HI> Pandon-Gate <HI>there still remains, as 'tis Thought, one of the little</HI> Turrets <HI>of that very Wall.</HI> There is indeed to this very Day a Part of that <HI>Turret</HI> in being, above <HI>Pandon-Gate,</HI> which, as the same Authority justly observed, is different from the Rest both in Fashon and Masonry, and undoubtedly carrys along with it a very great Age.</P>
<P>NEAR this <HI>Turret</HI> is the <HI>Wall-Knoll,</HI> a very ancient Place, which our Hi∣storian <HI>Grey</HI> says positively, <HI>Was a Part of the Picts-Wall;</HI> and indeed the very Name of it speaks as much. For the Word <HI>Wall</HI> upon the <HI>Knoll,</HI> which signifies an <HI>Hill</HI> or <HI>Eminence,</HI> cannot be understood of any other than the <HI>Ro∣man-Wall;</HI> Because it had this Name from very ancient Times, long before the Building of the <HI>Town-Wall,</HI> to which it almost adjoins.</P>
<P>A little above this Place is a <HI>Tower,</HI> commonly call'd the <NOTE N="l" PLACE="marg"><HI>Vide</HI> Wall-knoll Tower.</NOTE> <HI>Carpenters-Tower.</HI> This was one of the <HI>Roman-Towers,</HI> as was very Visible, before the taking down of the Upper-part of it. <NOTE N="m" PLACE="marg">Lib. de rebus Novo∣cast'.</NOTE> For it was of the same Size, Model, and Stone with the Tower of <NOTE N="n" PLACE="marg">This Village is now in the Possession of <HI>John Ro∣gers,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> of <HI>Newcastle,</HI> who has tur∣ned the inner Part of the Tower into Modern Rooms, but left the Walls of it still intire.</NOTE> <HI>Rutchester</HI> in <HI>Northumberland,</HI> which was undoub∣tedly one of the <HI>Roman Towers,</HI> by the <HI>Picts-Wall.</HI></P>
<P>IT must also not be omitted, that there is an ancient Tradition among the Inhabitants of this Town, that the <HI>Roman-Wall</HI> went through the <HI>West-Gate,</HI> and the <HI>Vicar's Garden,</HI> along that Ground where St. <HI>Nicholas-Church</HI> now stands, along <HI>Nether-Dean-Bridge,</HI> by the <HI>Wall-Knoll, Sally-Port,</HI> and so on to <HI>Walls-End.</HI></P>
<P>NOW to these Reasons and Authorities let us add what <NOTE N="o" PLACE="marg">Hollins. De∣scrip. of <HI>Brit. p. 128.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Hollinshead</HI> says, where he gives an Account of the Course of the <HI>Roman-Wall.</HI> It begins he says at <HI>Bolness upon Burgh,</HI> and so he brings it from Place to Place, 'till he brings it to <HI>Rutchester,</HI> then to <HI>Heddon,</HI> then to <HI>Wallbottle,</HI> then to <NOTE N="p" PLACE="marg">A small Vil∣lage about <HI>3</HI> Miles <HI>West</HI> from <HI>Newca∣stle,</HI> belonging to <HI>John Ro∣gers, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR></HI></NOTE> <HI>Denton,</HI> and to <HI>Newcastle,</HI> where it is thought St. <HI>Nicholas Church standeth</HI> on the same.</P>
<P>TO this I shall add the Authority of a Manuscript, I am obliged to a very worthy <NOTE N="q" PLACE="marg">John-Mil∣bank, <HI><ABBR>Esq</ABBR></HI></NOTE> Gentleman for; <HI>Hadrian</HI> built a Wall of Turff or Sods, from the Sea-Side beyond <HI>Carlisle</HI> unto <HI>Tinmouth.</HI> It was demolished after he was gone, and after him <HI>Severus</HI> built near the same a Wall of Stone, and made Towers and Watching Places at every Miles End, and a Passage all along by the Help of an <HI>Horn,</HI> or such an Instrument, that they might speak through the Wall, and tell where the Enemy was. This ended at the River of <HI>Tyne</HI> near <HI>Walls-End.</HI> This Authority goes on, I my self have seen it at <HI>Thirlwall,</HI> and it cometh by <HI>Portgate,</HI> near <HI>Stanchebank,</HI> by <HI>Halton,</HI> near the <HI>Long-Lane,</HI> where both the <HI>Walls</HI> are Apparent; as also at <HI>Denton,</HI> over <HI>Bonwell-Hill,</HI> down to
<PB N="4" REF="15"/>
the <HI>Westgate.</HI> And he also adds, you may see it down the Hill by Mr. <NOTE N="s" PLACE="marg">This House was in <HI>Pil∣grim-street</HI> on the West-side, a little before you come to <HI>Sil∣ver-street.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Leonard Carr</HI>'s House, and over <HI>Walker-Moor</HI> to <NOTE N="t" PLACE="marg"><P>It has been a Vulgar Er∣ror in many, who from the Name <HI>Walls∣end,</HI> have i∣magined that the Wall did actually end at that Vil∣lage; but it could never have been so, because that Place is half a Mile from the River Side. It is therefore not presuma∣ble that the <HI>Romans</HI> would have begun or end∣ed the Wall but at the Side of the said River, seeing all to the East∣ward of this Place, the Ri∣ver was the Continuation of the <HI>Prae∣tentura</HI> or Fence, from hindring the northerly In∣cursions. The first Track is half a Mile South from <HI>Wallsend,</HI> near <HI>Cou∣sins</HI>'s House, beginning a little to the East of it, at the Side of the River <HI>Tyne;</HI> and here certainly the 1st Station of <HI>Segedunum</HI> was originally placed. For <HI>162</HI> Paces a saint Track of the Wall appears running North twelve Degrees and a half Westerly; then forms an Angle, Pointing south westerly for <HI>135</HI> Paces to the above∣mention'd Mansion of <HI>Cousins</HI>'s House. About <HI>131</HI> Paces West of this, the <HI>Fossa</HI> begins to appear pretty distinct, measuring about <HI>20</HI> Foot in Breadth, and a little beyond it, is the Foundation of the Stone Wall, from hence it passes by a few Houses called the Bee-Houses, next through a small Village called <HI>Walker:</HI> Here the <HI>Fosta</HI> is <HI>40</HI> Foot broad, beyond which the Foundation of the <HI>Stone-Wall</HI> appears plain, then it ascends the <HI>Byker-Hill,</HI> run∣ing betwixt the Village of <HI>Byker</HI> and the Windmill, thence going down the Hill, passes through the <HI>Euesburn,</HI> crossing the Rivulet there; then I found it ascend the high Ground to the Westward of it, passing by the Mansion House and through the Garden to the <HI>Red-Barnes;</HI> from thence it is visible through the Fields, going Streight to the <HI>Sally-Port Gate</HI> of <HI>Newcastle. Gordon. Itiner. Septent. p. 70.</HI> — This Place where the End of the <HI>Wall</HI> is, belongs to Mr. <HI>Henry Waters</HI> of <HI>Newcastle.</HI></P></NOTE> <HI>Walls-End.</HI></P>
<P>THUS I think it very clear that these <HI>Roman-Walls</HI> went through this Town. Let us now see what this Town was in these ancient Times. <NOTE N="u" PLACE="marg">p. 779</NOTE> Mr. <HI>Cambden</HI> gives his Opinion thus: <HI>Gateside</HI> is commonly believed to be of grea∣ter Antiquity than <HI>Newcastle</HI> it self. And if I should say further, that this and <HI>Newcastle</HI> (for they seem formerly to have been only one Town parted by the River) were that Frontier-Garrison, which in the Times of the later Emperors was called <HI>Gabrosentum,</HI> and defended by the <HI>second Cohort of</HI> the <HI>Thraces;</HI> and that it retained it's old Name in a due Sense and Signification, notwithstanding <HI>this Newcastle</HI> has changed it's Name once or twice, I hope it will be no ways inconsistent with Truth. For <HI>Gaffr</HI> is used by the <HI>Britains</HI> for a <HI>Goat,</HI> and <HI>Hen,</HI> in Composition for <HI>Pen,</HI> which signifies an <HI>Head:</HI> And in this very Sense and Meaning it is plainly called <HI>Caprae Caput,</HI> or <HI>Goats-Head</HI> by our old Latin Historians.</P>
<P>THUS far this learned Antiquary. But notwithstanding this his Judgment, and that no tollerable Reason can be brought against the two Places having been but one; yet some will still have it, that <HI>Gateside,</HI> exclusive of <HI>Newcastle,</HI> is the ancient <HI>Gabrosentum,</HI> because of it's Name. For my Part I cannot help being of Mr. <HI>Cambden</HI>'s Opinion, and for this, among other Reasons; that if the Name of <HI>Caprae Caput</HI> discovers the <HI>Gabrosentum,</HI> then it is more probable that the principal Part of it lay on the North-side of the River than on the South: Because <HI>Gabrosentum</HI> was one of these <HI>Frontier Garrisons,</HI> which lay <HI>ad Lineam Valli,</HI> within the very Range of the Wall. For all these Garrisons <HI>ad Lineam Valli,</HI> were placed on the same Side of the River with the Wall it self, consequently <HI>Gateside</HI> could but at most have been a Part of <HI>Gabrosentum,</HI> and the meanest Part of it too; a Sort of Suburbs to it, as it actually was to this Town of <HI>Newcastle,</HI> in the Reign of <HI>Edward the Sixth,</HI> as shall be shown hereafter.</P>
<P>BUT if this is not allowed, (and yet it must be allowed, if <HI>Gateside</HI> has it's Name from the <HI>Gabrosentum</HI>) yet most certainly it was a <NOTE N="w" PLACE="marg"><HI>Vide Chap.</HI> of the upper Parts of the Town.</NOTE> <HI>garrison'd Fort</HI> in these very Times. For still there is the Remains of a <HI>Roman Turret,</HI> and the under Part of one of the <HI>Roman</HI> Towers to be seen, and the Name of <HI>Pandon</HI> is no small Corroboration of the Truth of it, as may be seen in our Account of that Place.</P>
<P>THUS I think whatever is boasted of the Antiquity of <HI>Gateside,</HI> it plainly appears, that if <HI>Caprae Caput,</HI> or <HI>Gateside</HI> Points out the ancient <HI>Gabrosentum, Newcastle</HI> must be her elder Sister; forasmuch as a Town must be earlier than it's Suburbs. And if it does not <NOTE N="x" PLACE="marg"><P><HI>Newcastle</HI> is by Mr. <HI>Cambden</HI> called the old <HI>Gabrocentum</HI> where the 2d Cohort of the <HI>Thracians</HI> lay; but according to the Course of the Forts in the <HI>Notitia Imperii, Gabrocentum</HI> is the seventeenth Station on the Wall; if therefore we follow the <HI>Noticia</HI> strictly, <HI>Newcastle</HI> would rather seem to be the <HI>Pons-Aelii,</HI> the 2d Station on the Wall, where the <HI>Cohort</HI> of the <HI>Cornovii</HI> lay. In this I have the concurring Opinion of the learned and judicious Antiquary Dr. <HI>Hunter</HI> of <HI>Durham. Gord. Itin. Septent. pag.</HI> 71. The ancient <HI>Orrhea,</HI> mentioned by <HI>Ptolomy</HI> has been thought by some to have been the Original of this Town, but for what Reason I know not.</P></NOTE> Point it out, it will then be a certain Con∣clusion, that there is an indisputable Account of <HI>this Town</HI> in these very Times of the <HI>Romans,</HI> which was some Hundreds of Years before <HI>Caprae Ca∣put,</HI> or <HI>Gateside</HI> is mentioned by the most early of our Latin Historians.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>FTER the Departure of the <HI>Romans,</HI> it seems to have chan∣ged it's Name, as I shall shew immediately; and probably by the latter Part of it's after Name <HI>Monkchester,</HI> it was a Place of Defence, or <HI>Garrison'd Fort,</HI> during the Times of the <HI>Saxons</HI> and <HI>Danes.</HI> This Name of <HI>Monkchester</HI> it retain∣ed 'till after the Conquest. Thus we are told from <HI>Simeon Dunelmensis,</HI> a Monk of the Church of <HI>Durham,</HI> that <HI>New∣castle</HI> upon <HI>Tyne</HI> was anciently called <HI>Monkchester, civitas Monachorum,</HI> or the Town of the Monks, not because it belong'd to the Monks, but because the Monks of those Parts dwelt there.<NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Ex Collect.

<P>SOME, are of Opinion, that <HI>Newcastle</HI> got it's Name of <HI>Monkchester,</HI> because the Monks in Time of Danger came for Protection to it, and not from their inhabiting it. This is quite contrary to the Authority above-mentioned, and all others that I have met with. Mr. <HI>Eachard</HI> in his History of <HI>England</HI> says, that <HI>Monkchester</HI> was so called from certain Monks who <HI>lived there</HI> in great

In the Year 1074, there was a certain Man in the Province of the <HI>Mercians,</HI> a Presbyter and Prior of the Monastery of <HI>Winchelescumbe,</HI> who was a Monk, whose Name was <HI>Aldwin:</HI> This Man preferr'd a voluntary Poverty and Con∣tempt of the World to all it's Honours and Riches; and having learned from the History of the <HI>Northumbers,</HI> that that Land was formerly famous for Mul∣titudes of Monks and religious Men, who tho' in the Flesh, lived not accor∣ding to the Flesh, but whilst they were on Earth, had their Conversation in Heaven: He desired greatly to visit the Monasteries of these Places, (tho' He knew they were forsaken and left desolate) and there to lead a poor Life in Imitation of them. Coming therefore as far as the Monastery of <HI>Evesham,</HI> he made known his Purpose to certain of the Brethren; upon which, two of them associated with him; one of them was named <HI>Elfwie,</HI> who was a Dea∣con, and after that a Priest; The other's Name was <HI>Renifrid;</HI> he was igno∣rant of Letters. These the <HI>Abbot</HI> gave leave to accompany him, but not 'till he had set <HI>Aldwin</HI> over them, and committed to him the Care of their Souls. After this, they set forward on their Journey a Foot, having an Ass to carry their Books, Necessaries, and their Sacerdotal Vestments, to celebrate divine Service in. At length they came to <HI>York,</HI> desiring of <HI>Hugh,</HI> the Son of <HI>Bal∣drick,</HI> who was then Sheriff, <NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg"><P>Ut eis du∣cem itineris inveniret us∣que locum qui Monkce∣ster, i. e. Monacho∣rum civitas appellatur, nunc Nov∣um-Castel∣lum nomi∣natur. Quo per ductum venientes, ad tempus ibidem sunt morati, ubi nullum anti∣quum San∣ctorum Chri∣sti reperirunt Vestigium. <HI>Dugd. Mon. Tom.</HI> 1. <HI>p.</HI> 41.</P></NOTE> that he would procure them a Guide to <HI>Monk∣chester,</HI> that is, the City of the Monks, which is now called <HI>Newcastle,</HI> whi∣ther being brought by their Guide, they staid a-while, but found not any Remains of it's former Sanctity, no Footsteps of the Religious People who had formerly <HI>dwelt there. Walcher</HI> Bishop of <HI>Durham</HI> hearing of this, sent for them, and gave them the Monastery of <HI>Jarray,</HI> which at that Time was unroof'd, and had scarce any Thing remaining of it's ancient Grandeur.</P>
<P>AND now how long it had been in this desolate Condition we may gather from <NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">Mag. Brit. Nov. &amp; An∣tiq. ex <HI>Hol∣bius.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Hollingshead.</HI> By the Invasion of the <HI>Danes,</HI> says he, the Churches and Monasteries throughout <HI>Northumberland</HI> were so waisted and ruined, that a Man could scarcely find a Church standing at this Time in all that Country; and as for those that remained, they were all covered with Broom or Thatch: And as for any <HI>Abby</HI> or <HI>Monastery</HI> there was not one left in all the Country; neither did any Man, for the Space of <HI>Two hundred Years,</HI> take Care for the repairing or building up of any Thing in Decay; so that the People of this County knew not what a Monk meant. And if they saw any, they wonder∣ed at the Strangeness of the Sight. One Place there was in this County, fa∣mous for being the Habitation of Monks, from whence it was called <HI>Monk∣chester,</HI> but that also was so ruinated and destroy'd, that when the Monks of <HI>Mercia</HI> (the Monks mentioned before) came to it, they found no Token or Remnant of any Religions Persons who had had an Habitation there; all was defaced and gone.</P>
<P>NOW with respect to <HI>Monkchester</HI> this seems to be punctually true. For as <HI>Hollingshead</HI> observes that it was about 200 Years from the Ruin of the Mo∣nasteries to this Time after the Conquest <NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">Anno 1074</NOTE>; so it must be taken Notice of, that the <HI>Danes,</HI> in the Year <NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg">Hollin.</NOTE> 875, which was the 4th of the Reign of King <HI>Alured,</HI> divided themselves. So that King <HI>Haldon</HI> with one Part there∣of went into <HI>Northumberland,</HI> and lay in the Winter Season near <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="marg">He sat down with his Men at <HI>Tames∣mouth,</HI> which is be∣tween <HI>Gate∣side</HI> and <HI>Whickham. Sim. Dunel'.</HI></NOTE> to the River of <HI>Tyne,</HI> where he divided the Country amongst his Men, and remained there for the Space of two Years, and oftentimes fetched thither Booties and Preys out of the Country of the <HI>Scots</HI> and <HI>Picts.</HI></P>
<P>IT appears then from this, that the Monasteries of <HI>Monkchester</HI> had been in Ruins about 200 Years, that is to say, from the Year 875 to the Year 1074, the Time of the Coming of the <HI>Mercian</HI> Monk.</P>
<P>LET us now see if we can form any probable Conjecture when it was first inhabited by <HI>Monks,</HI> and got the Name of <HI>Monkchester.</HI> And this I imagine happen'd towards the later End of the 7th Century. For in the Year 635, the Monastical Life was brought in among the <HI>Northumbers</HI> by <HI>Aidan,</HI> who was

that Year made Bishop of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> and had his Seat at <NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg"><P><HI>Lindisfern</HI> is a small I∣sland on the Northern Shore of <HI>England,</HI> made only by swelling Tides, for at Ebb it is joined to the main Land of <HI>England,</HI> by a Ridge of sandy Earth. It is, as we are inform'd called the <HI>Holy-Island,</HI> from it's first Bishop living in an Holy Society with his Clergy. He dy'd <HI>Aug. 31</HI>st, <HI>Anno 651</HI> and was buried in the Church of <HI>Lindisfern.</HI> He was succeeded by <HI>Finan</HI> a Monk of the Monastery of <HI>Hy,</HI> who died <HI>Feb. 12,</HI> in the Year <HI>601. Coleman</HI> succeeded him, and was Bishop about <HI>3</HI> Years. But being worsted in the Controversy about the keeping of <HI>Easter,</HI> he gave up his Bishoprick, and left <HI>Lindisfern. Tuda</HI> suc∣ceeded him, and dy'd the same Year he was made. After this the See was vacant fourteen Years, and then fill'd up by <HI>Eata</HI> in the Year <HI>678,</HI> who continued 'till the Year <HI>685,</HI> being then chosen to the See of <HI>Hagustald.</HI> He was succeeded by St. <HI>Cuthbert,</HI> who was consecrated at <HI>York</HI> by <HI>Theodore,</HI> Archbishop of <HI>Canterbury</HI> upon <HI>Easter-Day,</HI> which happened <HI>March 26.</HI> The Archbishop was assisted by seven other Bishops, and King <HI>Egfrid,</HI> and many of his Nobles were present. When he had been Bishop about two Years, he gave up his Charge, and foreseeing his Death approaching he resigned his Bishoprick, and re∣tired to his former Solitude, the Island of <HI>Fern,</HI> where he died in two Months Time, viz. <HI>March</HI> the 20th <HI>687,</HI> and was buried at <HI>Lindisfern. Eadbert</HI> was chosen after him, he governed the See about ten Years, and dy'd in the Year <HI>697. Eadfrith</HI> or <HI>Egfrith</HI> succeeded him, who is said to have wrote a very fine Book with his own Hand, containing the Gospels in Latin, which <HI>Ethelwold,</HI> his Successor, adorned with Gilding and Jewels, <HI>Bilfrid</HI> the Anchorite painted, and <HI>Aldred</HI> the Priest enlarged, with an interlineary Version in the Saxon Tongue: My Authority says further, that this very Book is still preserved in the <HI>Cotton-Library.</HI> — This famous Library had the Misfortune this last Year <HI>1731</HI> to be set on Fire, and part of it, and its Manuscripts were burnt, but we hope this valuable Piece of Antiquity has escape.</P>
<P>This Bishop died <HI>Anno 721,</HI> and was succeeded by <HI>Ethelwold,</HI> after the See had been vacant near three Years. He died in the Year <HI>740. Keneuif,</HI> or <HI>Kenulf</HI> succeeded him the same Year, who died in the Year <HI>783. Henulf</HI> was succeeded by <HI>Higbaldus,</HI> who died <HI>May</HI> the twenty fifth, <HI>803.

Eardulph</HI> succeeded him. This Bishop left <HI>Lindisfern</HI> in the Year <HI>875,</HI> on Account of the Invasion of the <HI>Danes,</HI> and wan∣dered up and down for some Years. At length he and his Company fix'd at <HI>Cunacestre</HI> (now called <HI>Chester in the Street</HI>) which is a Village about seven Miles distant from <HI>Newcastle,</HI> Southward. This was in the Year <HI>883,</HI> and there the See continu'd <HI>113</HI> Years. This Bishop died in the Year <HI>900.</HI> He was the first of the Bishops of <HI>Lindisfern</HI> that exercised Episcopal Authority over the See of <HI>Hex∣am;</HI> which he did in the first Year that he settled at <HI>Chester:</HI> The See of <HI>Hexam</HI> continued 'till the Reign of King <HI>Henry</HI> the first, under the Jurisdiction of the Bishops of <HI>Lindisfern.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Eardulph</HI> was succeeded by <HI>Cutheard,</HI> who died in the Year <HI>915. Tilred</HI> succeeded him, and died in the Year <HI>928. Tilred</HI> was succeeded by <HI>Wigred,</HI> who died in the Year <HI>944.

In their Return, they passed through <HI>Durham,</HI> which at this Time was a Place wild and not habitable, being all a Wood, full of thick Bushes and Trees, saving only a little Plain upon the Top of the Hill, which was wont to be sowed, and is the very Place where now the <HI>Church</HI> standeth,) and were mightily taken with the Situation of it. Here <HI>Aldwinus</HI> first deposited the Body of St. <HI>Cuthbert,</HI> and resolved to make this Place his Episcopal Seat. Having therefore grubb'd up the Wood, he began to build a Church of Stone,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mag. Britt. p. 742. ex Godwin.</NOTE> and Houses about it for his Company. The <HI>Governour</HI> of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> then named <HI>Uthred,</HI> and the People from the River <HI>Coqued</HI> to the <HI>Tees,</HI> came in so rea∣dily to his Assistance, and continued their Help so long, that the Wood was soon grubbed up and the Church and Houses finished, insomuch that <HI>Aldwin</HI> dedicated the Church in the 3d year after he began the Work, upon <HI>Sept.</HI> the 4th. This was the Beginning of the Church and City of <HI>Durham</HI> or <HI>Dunhelm</HI> more properly, which takes it Name from <HI>Dun,</HI> which signifies a Mountain, and <HI>Holm</HI> a River-Island in the <HI>Saxon</HI> Language, because the River <HI>Were,</HI> with it's circling Stream, washes the Hill on which it stands on all Sides, so that it makes it almost an Island. — <HI>Aldwin</HI> died in the year <HI>1017,</HI> and was succeeded by <HI>Eadmund,</HI> who was e∣lected the year <HI>1020,</HI> after the See had been vacant about <HI>3</HI> years, he died <HI>Anno 1040,</HI> and was buried in the Church of <HI>Durham. Eadred</HI> succeeded him, but enjoyed that Honour no great while; for in <HI>10</HI> Months time he died, He was succeeded by <HI>Egelric, Anno 1049,</HI> who built a Church at <HI>Chester</HI> upon the Street, in Me∣mory that the Bishops of <HI>Lindisfern</HI> had rested themselves there, together with the Body of St. <HI>Cuthbert, 118</HI> years, during the Time of the <HI>Danish</HI> Wars: He resign'd in the year <HI>1056,</HI> and was succeeded by <HI>Egelwyn,</HI> who died in the year <HI>1071. Walter</HI> or <HI>Walcher</HI> succeeded him, who was slain at <HI>Gateside</HI> (as a shewn in our Account of that Place) <HI>May</HI> 14th, <HI>1080.</HI> After this the See was void for <HI>6</HI> Months; and then on the 9th of <HI>November</HI> was filled up by <HI>William Kairlipho,</HI> who died <HI>Anno 1095.</HI> This Man, as <HI>Godwin</HI> goes on, pulling down to the Ground the Church of <HI>Durham,</HI> which <HI>Aldwinus</HI> had first built, began to erect ano∣ther far more magnificent, but lived not to finish it himself, <HI>Malcolme,</HI> King of <HI>Scots,</HI> and <HI>Purgot</HI> Prior of <HI>Durham,</HI> laid the <HI>3</HI> first Stones, <HI>July 30,</HI> or (as some deliver <HI>Aug. 11.</HI>) <HI>1093.</HI> This Bishop, after the See, had been vacant <HI>3</HI> years, and <HI>4</HI> Months, was succeeded by <HI>Ranulf Flambard, Anno 1099,</HI> who died <HI>Sept. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, 1128.

<PB N="9" REF="20"/>
flourished in this whole Kingdom. This Account <HI>Hollingshead</HI> gives in the following Words: Great Numbers of Persons daily offered themselves to be baptized, insomuch that within the Space of 7 Days (as is left in Writing) <HI>Aidan</HI> christned 15 Thousand Persons, of the which no small Part forsaking the World, betook themselves to a Solitary kind of Life. Thus by continual Preaching the Gospel in that Country, it came to pass in the End, that the Faith was generally received of all the People; and such Zeal to advance the Christian Religion daily increased amongst them, that no where could be found greater. Hereupon were no small Number of Churches built in all Pla∣ces abroad in those Parts by Procurement of King <HI>Oswold,</HI> all Men liberally consenting (according to the rated Substance) to be Contributors towards the Charges. By this Means the Kingdom of the <HI>Northumbers</HI> flourish'd, as well in Fame of Increase of Religion, as also in civil Policy and prudent Ordinances.</P>
<P>When now it is considered that the Business of Religion went on so Brisk∣ly throughout the whole Kingdom of the <HI>Northumbers;</HI> it is rational to sup∣pose that this Place, as it was not only convenient for the monastical Life as to Retirement, but also a Security to it too, (being at that Time a garrison'd Fort) was certainly as early inhabited by the Monks as the abovementioned Time; and besides if we consider the Veneration it is mention'd with by many Historians for the severe rigid Lives of it's Monks; how it was the most emi∣nent Place in the North, for the monastical Life, so very famous on that ac∣count, as to change it's former Name to that of <HI>Monkchester:</HI> There can scarce be allowed it a later Time to arrive at such a Pitch of Eminency and Glory. Before the Name of <HI>Monkchester,</HI> I imagine, from it's being a Place of For∣tification, that it had the Name of <HI>Chester,</HI> as <HI>Weremuth</HI> was the original Name of that Place, but was afterwards called <HI>Monkweremuth,</HI> from the Monks inha∣biting there. It seems all along to have been a Place of Defence and Fortifi∣cation. It was the Ancient <HI>Gabrosentum,</HI> according to Mr. <HI>Cambden;</HI> or as o∣thers more justly imagine the <HI>Pons Aelii</HI> of the <HI>Romans;</HI> was a garrison'd Fort, 'till inhabited by the Monks; and was such from the Time of the Monks 'till the Conquest.</P>
<P>THE Name of <HI>Monkchester</HI> continued 'till the Building of the Castle, and after that, from the Building of it, it got the Name of <HI>New-castle:</HI> The Oc∣casion of which was this. <HI>Malcolme</HI> King of <HI>Scotland</HI> having entred with his Army into the Confines of <HI>England,</HI> came with it into <HI>Northumberland,</HI> and waisted and plundered the whole Country as far as the River <HI>Tyne;</HI> the Con∣queror being all the while in <HI>Normandy,</HI> and also his Son <HI>Robert Curtois.</HI> But no sooner were the King and his Son come into <HI>England,</HI> than <HI>Robert</HI> was sent with an Army against <HI>Malcolme</HI> to drive him out of the Country. The <HI>Scots</HI> being appriz'd of this, retir'd into their own Country, and <HI>Robert</HI> with his Army encamp'd upon the Banks of the <HI>Tyne,</HI> where he built the <HI>Castle</HI> to de∣fend these Northern Parts from the Incursions of the <HI>Scots,</HI> for the <NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg">Mag. Brit. p. 608. Poly. virg. &amp;c.</NOTE> Future. The Chronicle of <HI>Mailros</HI> says, that the Conqueror sent his Son <HI>Robert</HI> into <HI>Scotland,</HI> against <HI>Malcolme,</HI> in the Year 1080, who, having done nothing, up∣on his return, built the <HI>New-castle.</HI> From hence it is easy to conclude, that the Castle was founded the same Year, towards the latter End of it. For <HI>Dugdale</HI> tells us in his <HI>Monasticon,</HI> that <NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg">Anno Do∣mini MLXXX Rex Williel∣mus Autum∣nali Tempo∣re Rober∣tum Fillium suum contra Malcomum misit; sed cum perve∣nisset ad Eg∣glesbreth, nullo conse∣cto negotio, reversus Ca∣stellum No∣vum super flumen Ty∣nae condidit. <HI>Dug.

<P>THUS the Town lost it's Name of <HI>Monkchester</HI> for that of <HI>Newcastle,</HI> which it retains to this Day. But however by the building of the Castle it lost nothing else; for the Building of the said Castle did not destroy or take away the Right or Interest which the Towns-men had before; but that still remained as before.</P>
<P>AFTER this the Town grew more populous, and increas'd in Trade and Wealth; had great Privileges granted them by the Kings, built Churches, Monasteries, Walls, Bridges, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as shall be seen in the following Treatise.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. III.</HI> Of the <HI>WALLS</HI> of this TOWN.</HEAD>
<P><HI><SEG REND="decorInit">N</SEG>EW CASTLE</HI> is seated on the Northern Bank of the Ri∣ver <HI>Tyne;</HI> and is bounded on the East by the Land of <HI>By∣ker;</HI> on the West by the Lands belonging formerly to the <HI>Prior of Tinemouth;</HI> on the North by the Lands of <HI>Kenton,</HI> and <HI>Coxlodge,</HI> and on the South by the County of <HI>Durham.</HI></P>
<P>IT is surrounded with a <HI>Stone-Wall,</HI> which at the Time it was built, and for many Ages after, was undoubtedly of very great Strength. This has several Gates belonging to it, <HI>Round Towers,</HI> and <HI>Square Turrets,</HI> which shall by and by be considered. On the Out-side of it is a Ditch or Trench, and on the Inside it is ramper'd with Earth.</P>
<P><NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Grey.</NOTE>THE Cause of Building this great Wall was the often Invasion of the <HI>Scots</HI> into this Place and Country; they continually infested it and the rich Monasteries in these Northern Parts; the religious Houses of this Town, and the adiacent Places being above Forty.</P>
<P>SOME are of Opinion, that the Walls were begun in the Reign of <HI>King Henry the Third.</HI> But the Author just now mentioned, imagines Them to have been earlier. King <HI>John,</HI> he says, gave great Priviledges to this Town, and probably the <HI>New-gate,</HI> and Walls thereabout, were built in his Time; the North Part of the Wall being the oldest, and of another Fashion than the other Walls.</P>
<P>IN the Reign of King <HI>Henry</HI> the 3d, the same Author says, the West part of the Wall was built; but I am rather inclined to believe, that that Part of the Wall was not built 'till the Reign of <HI>Edward the 1st.</HI> The Wall from
<PB N="11" REF="22"/>
the Time it was begun, went on but slowly 'till this Reign, when an Acci∣dent hapned, which revived the former Fears of the Towns-Men, and put them in Mind of the neglected Wall, which, 'till that Time had got no far∣ther than <HI>Ever-Tower,</HI> as appears by the old Part of the Wall, ending there∣abouts. The Accident was this, <NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Cambden.</NOTE> in the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the 1st, a very <HI>rich Burgher</HI> being carried off a Prisoner by the <HI>Scots,</HI> out of the Middle of the Town, first paid a round Ransom himself, and afterwards began the 1st For∣tifications of the Place.</P>
<P>IT is true, that this Accident was the Occasion of carrying on the Wall; but Mr. <HI>Cambden</HI> is mistaken in saying it occasioned the Beginning of it. For it was begun some Years before the Reign of <HI>Edward the 1st.</HI> For from <HI>New∣gate</HI> to the <HI>Ever-Tower</HI> as has just now been observed, is a Work older, and vastly different from what the Wall is from <HI>Ever-Tower</HI> towards the <HI>West-gate.</HI> This Wall, leading to the <HI>West-gate,</HI> was it which was begun in the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the 1st, for in this Reign it was, (when Leave was granted to the preaching Friers to break out that <HI>Little Gate</HI> which now leads into the <HI>Wardens-Close,</HI> then their Garden, that this Wall was called the <NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">Vid. Dur∣ham-Tower <HI>and</HI> Black-Friers.</NOTE> <HI>New-Wall;</HI> and surely a New-Wall, will imply that there was an Old one before, was the thing itself not still a Matter of Fact as it really is to any Observer.</P>
<P>HOW long the Walls were a Building, or who they were in particular that contributed towards the Building of them, is a Matter pretty much in the Dark. However, 'tis <NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg"><P><HI>Gardiner, chap. 4.</HI></P>
<P>This Au∣thor, whose Name was <HI>Ralph Gar∣diner,</HI> liv'd at <HI>Chirton,</HI> a Village East of <HI>Newca∣stle,</HI> near the Town of <HI>Shields,</HI> which Village is now in the Possession of <HI>Rob<SUP>t</SUP> Law∣son</HI> and <HI>Ed∣ward Col∣lingwood.</HI> Esqrs. He was a bitter Enemy to this Town, and did all the Mischief to it that lay in his Power, as appears in every Page of his Book. In which are Numbers of Falsities.</P></NOTE> supposed, that King <HI>Edward the 1st,</HI> was a Contri∣butor to them. The Names of some of the Round-Towers also give us some Light, which to this Day do seemingly bear the Names of their ancient Foun∣ders, which may in some Measure occasion a Guess at the Time of their Buil∣ding.</P>
<P>THE Town, after the compleating of the Walls, was divided into 24 <HI>Wards,</HI> according to the Number of the Gates, and round Towers in the Wall, which Towers and Gates were wont be defended in Times of Hostili∣ty with the <HI>Scots,</HI> by the particular Wards appropriated to them.</P>
<P>THE 1st Gate I shall begin with is the <HI>Close-gate,</HI> which is so called, be∣cause it stands in a narrow Street called the Close, it had in Ward, from the <HI>Close-gate</HI> upon the <HI>South-rawe,</HI> so going Eastward unto the <HI>Javil-grippe,</HI> but nothing of <HI>Javil-grippe,</HI> then going Westward upon the North unto the <HI>Close-gate.</HI></P>
<P>FROM the <HI>Close-gate</HI> there are Stairs leading up to a <HI>Round-Tower</HI> called the <HI>White-Fryer-Tower.</HI> This Tower had in Ward, from the East-end of <HI>Bailiff-gate,</HI> opposite to the <HI>Javil-grippe,</HI> with all that dwell upon the <HI>High-Stairs</HI> in the <HI>Close,</HI> unto and with the West-side of these <HI>Stairs</HI> that lead unto the <HI>South-Postern</HI> of the <HI>Castle,</HI> with all <HI>Javil-grippe</HI> Eastward, and from the <HI>Javil-grippe</HI> to the South-rawe of the Close, and with all the <HI>Bridge-End.</HI></P>
<P>THIS Tower, with the Wall leading to the <HI>little Gate,</HI> (commonly called the <HI>Postern-gate,</HI> but originally the Gate of the <HI>White-Fryers,</HI> or <HI>White-Fryer-gate</HI>) were together with the Gate itself, probably built by the <HI>White-Fryers;</HI> for the <HI>White-Fryers</HI> were situated in the South-west-end of the Street of <HI>West-gate,</HI> in the same Grounds were are now the Houses of Mr. <HI>Anderson, George Grey,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> and others. And as it is reasonable to believe, that what∣ever <HI>Religious House,</HI> or <HI>Nobleman,</HI> built a Tower or Piece of the Wall, that it would be built chiefly for their own Security; so the Buildings now mentioned, being so situated as I have just now observed, are a Proof that the <HI>White-Fryers</HI> were the Founders. And if it be considered that the <HI>White-Fryers</HI> were <NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg"><HI>See</HI> White-Fryers.</NOTE> founded by King <HI>Edward</HI> the 1st, in whose Reign the above-mentioned Accident happened, which occasioned a fresh Beginning of Building of the Wall; it will appear still more probable, that these <HI>Fryers</HI> were the Builders. It may indeed be said, that as they were sounded in this
<PB N="12" REF="23"/>
Reign, it can't be imagin'd they had sufficient Riches for such an Un∣dertaking. This is readily granted, but when it is considered, that these <HI>Fry∣ers</HI> were newly founded by King <HI>Edward</HI> the 1st, that they were the first of that Order that had been in this Place, that they were <HI>Carmelites,</HI> or original∣ly coming from Mount <HI>Carmel</HI> in <HI>Syria,</HI> and that the Prayers of all Monaste∣ries were thought more particularly available for the Souls in Purgatory; it will follow I think rationally, that they were more able <HI>then</HI> to do such a Thing by getting the Contributions of others, than they could have been of themselves 200 Years after. The Name given to these Walls is also another Argument; it is more probable, that the <HI>White-Fryer-Tower,</HI> the <HI>Wall</HI> and <HI>Gate</HI> now mentioned, were so called, (as other Towers were) from their Foun∣ders, than from their bare Situation. For the Walls behind the <HI>Black-Fryers</HI> are not called after their Name, because they were not built by them, but by King <HI>Edward</HI> the 1st, as shall be shewn below.</P>
<P>THIS Tower is now the <HI>Meeting-House</HI> or <HI>Hall</HI> of the Company of Ma∣sons.</P>
<P><HI>GREY</HI> in mentioning the Ports or Gates of <HI>Newcastle,</HI> says, there were be∣sides <HI>These, Postern-Gates</HI> belonging to the <HI>Religious Houses;</HI> I have met with no more than three, and this <HI>White-Friers-gate</HI> is undoubtedly one of them. It seems to be much of the same Kind with that which leads into the <HI>Warden's-Close.</HI> It has been an Out-let to the Fryers, that they might walk to the <HI>Forth</HI> and the <HI>neighbouring Fields;</HI> and that it might be of Use and Service to the <HI>Castle,</HI> in Times of Hostility with the <HI>Scots.</HI> I imagine it was out at this Gate, that the <HI>Townsmen</HI> made that famous Sally, mention'd by <HI>Grey,</HI> who says, that in the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the 3d, <NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">See a more perfect Ac∣count in the Year of the Mayors, <HI>1342.</HI></NOTE> Three hundred valiant Men issued out of the Town through a <HI>Postern-gate,</HI> and came suddenly in the Night up∣on a great Army of the <HI>Scots,</HI> which lay in the West Part of the Town, and raised the Army, put them to flight, and took Earl <HI>Murray</HI> Prisoner in his Tent, and others.</P>
<P>THE next Round Tower to <HI>White-Fryer-gate</HI> is <HI>Denton-Tower,</HI> or <HI>Nevil-Tower,</HI> which had in Ward all the <HI>Hairy-Hugh,</HI> on the South Side of the <HI>White-Fryers,</HI> with all the Houses standing there, upon the <HI>Burn-bank,</HI> betwixt the <HI>Fryer-Kirk,</HI> and a Burne, unto the Stone Bridge in <HI>Bailiff-gate,</HI> with all <HI>Bailiff-gate,</HI> upward that same Rawe unto <HI>Denton-Chare,</HI> with <HI>Denton-Chare.</HI></P>
<P>WHY it was called <HI>Denton-Tower,</HI> I can give no Reason, unless it was from it's having in Ward the Lane called <HI>Denton-Chare;</HI> but it has the Name of <HI>Nevil-Tower,</HI> from the <HI>Nevil</HI> Family of <HI>Raby</HI> who built it, which Family was honoured with the Title of <HI>Earl</HI> in the Reign of <HI>Richard</HI> the 2d, <HI>Ralph Nevil</HI> Lord of <HI>Raby,</HI> being created <HI>Earl</HI> of <HI>Westmoreland,</HI> in the 21st of that Reign: His House in <HI>West-gate,</HI> called <HI>Westmoreland-place,</HI> which shall be con∣sidered when we treat of that Street, had this Tower built behind it for it's Security and Defence. The Tower is now the Hall of the <HI>Wallers, Brick-layers</HI> and <HI>Plaisterers,</HI> and was repair'd by them <HI>Anno Dom'</HI> 1711, <HI>Richard Flet∣cher,</HI> and <HI>William Johnson,</HI> Wardens.</P>
<P>THE next Round Tower is <HI>West-spittle-Tower,</HI> which had in Ward the <HI>Side</HI> upon the West Rawe under the Castle Moat, from the <HI>Castle-gate,</HI> so down∣ward on that Rawe, to and with a great Waste belonging to <HI>Laurentius Acton,</HI> opposite to a Corner Shop of a Chauntery in St. <HI>John</HI>'s <HI>Kirk,</HI> next the Pant; also from that Pant upwards upon the East-Rawe in the <HI>Side,</HI> with the <HI>South Kirk-Style</HI> of St. <HI>Nicholas,</HI> by the East-Side of St. <HI>Nicholas.</HI></P>
<P>THIS Tower has it's Name from St. <HI>Mary the Virgin's Hospital,</HI> which was otherwise called <HI>West-spittle,</HI> to which it almost adjoins; it must have been built by the Master and Brethren of that Hospital for the same Reasons that the other two Towers before-mentioned were built by their supposed Founders.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="24"/>THE Tower next to this has the Name of <HI>Stank-Tower.</HI> It had in Ward all <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Now called</HI> Back-rawe.</NOTE> <HI>Gallowgate;</HI> opposite to the <HI>Castle-Yates,</HI> so going Northward, from the East-end of <HI>Gallowgate,</HI> upwards that same Rawe, unto the East-end of <HI>Den∣ton-Chare,</HI> with the <HI>Iron-market,</HI> with all the Houses opposite to the <HI>Iron-market,</HI> down to St. <HI>Nicholas Pant,</HI> as their Doors open towards the <HI>Iron-market,</HI> or towards the Pant, or towards St. <HI>Nicholas Kirk-Yard.</HI></P>
<P><HI>GUNNER-TOWER,</HI> is the next; it had in Ward, from <HI>All-Hallow-Pant,</HI> beside <HI>Cordiner,</HI> so going downward the same Rawe towards <HI>Cale-Cross,</HI> and so going upwards by that <HI>Flesher-Rawe,</HI> unto <HI>Painter-hugh</HI> beside <HI>Swin-burne-place,</HI> unto a Place called <HI>Pencher-place,</HI> beyond <HI>Painter-Heugh,</HI> as it stan∣deth beyond <HI>Lorkburne.</HI></P>
<P>BETWEEN this Tower, and one next to it, is a <HI>Postern</HI> which leads to the Forth. It was made <HI>Anno</HI> 1705, when <HI>Thomas Wass,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> was Mayor, <HI>Matthew Matfin,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> Sheriff. There is also another Passage from it into <HI>Westgate.</HI></P>
<P><HI>PINK-TOWER.</HI> This Tower had in Ward in the <HI>Close,</HI> from the High-Stairs that lead from the <HI>South Postern</HI> of the <HI>Castle</HI> towards the Close, so going Eastward on that same Rawe, by the North-side of <HI>Sandhill,</HI> unto and with St. <HI>Mary-lane,</HI> with the Houses upon the Corner, called St. <HI>Mary-Lands</HI> in <HI>All-hallow-kirk,</HI> and so going upwards all the West-rawe in the Side, to a great Waste upon the <HI>Castle-hugh,</HI> sometimes call'd old <HI>Laurentius Acton</HI>'s Waste, opposite to the Pant at <HI>Lorkburne.</HI></P>
<P><HI>WEST-GATE,</HI> is the next, which is the <HI>High-way West</HI> into the Counties of <HI>Northumberland</HI> and <HI>Cumberland,</HI> and is <NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg">Grey.</NOTE> said to have been built by <HI>Roger de Thornton,</HI> in Memory that he came from the <HI>West-country,</HI> according to the old saying,
<Q><L>At the <HI>West-gate</HI> came <HI>Thornton</HI> in,</L>
<L>With a <HI>Hap,</HI> and a <HI>Half-penny,</HI> and a <HI>Lamb-skin.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>THIS Gate had in Ward from the Vennel that leads into <HI>White-Fryer-Kirk,</HI> so going upon the West Rawe of <HI>Westgate,</HI> unto the <HI>Westyate,</HI> with all that dwell without that Yate. Also from the West-end of <HI>Denton Chare,</HI> so going upward upon the East-Rawe of <HI>Westgate</HI> unto the <HI>Westyate,</HI> with all that dwell in St. <HI>John</HI>'s <HI>Kirk-yard,</HI> and with all that dwell from the said Kirk unto the <HI>West-gate.</HI> It is now the <HI>Hall</HI> of the <HI>House-Carpenters.</HI></P>
<P><HI>DURHAM-TOWER</HI> is the next, and it had in Ward from St. <HI>John</HI>'s <HI>Chare</HI> to going upward by <HI>Urd-place,</HI> upon the West-Rawe of <HI>Beer-market,</HI> unto the <HI>Shod-Frier-Chare,</HI> with all the <HI>Shod-Frier Chare.</HI></P>
<P><HI>HEBER-TOWER</HI> is the next; it had in Ward all the <HI>Meal-market</HI> from <HI>Denton-Chare,</HI> to <HI>Pudding-Chare,</HI> with all <HI>Pudding-Chare</HI> and St. <HI>John</HI>'s <HI>Chare.</HI></P>
<P>THIS Tower is now the <HI>Hall</HI> of the <HI>Armourers, Curriers</HI> and <HI>Felt-makers,</HI> who were made one Fellowship in the 36th of <HI>Henry</HI> the 8th. They were order∣ed to associate themselves in the Feast of <HI>Corpus Christi,</HI> and go together in Procession, as other Mysteries, and sustain the Charges of the <HI>Lights Pageant,</HI> and <HI>Place,</HI> on the same Feast; according to old ancient Custom. And the Ordinance therein was to be devised by Their <HI>Wardens</HI> when the Hour was assigned, upon Pain to lose and forfeit one <HI>Pound of Wax,</HI> to be applied to the Use of the whole Fellowship of the said Occupations. The best Account I have met with of these kind of Plays, is of one that was play'd in the City of <HI>Coventry.</HI> <NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg">Step. 1st V. p. 138.</NOTE> Before the Suppression of Monasteries, the City of <HI>Coventry</HI> was very famous for the Pageants that were played therein upon <HI>Corpus Christi</HI> Day, which occasioning very great Confluence of People to it from far and near, was of no small Benefit thereto; which Pageants being acted with migh∣ty State and Reverence by the <HI>Franciscan-Fryers,</HI> had Theatres for the several Scenes very large and high, placed upon Wheels, and drawn to all the emi∣nent

<P>A little beyond this Tower, opposite to the Monastery of the <HI>Black-Friers</HI> is a <HI>little Gate</HI> in the Wall, which I imagine to be one of those which <HI>Grey</HI> calls <HI>Postern-Gates.</HI> It leads into the <HI>Warden</HI>'s-<HI>Close,</HI> and was made in the Reign of King <HI>Edward</HI> the 1st. The <HI>Black Fryers</HI> petition'd the King, he being then at <HI>Durham,</HI> that they might have a Passage though his <HI>New Wall</HI> into their Garden, which was accordingly granted. The original Grant is still in Being, with the King's Seal at it, in the Hands of Mr. <HI>Joshua Douglas,</HI> who obliged me with the following Copy of it.</P>

<P><HI>MORDEN-TOWER</HI> had in Ward both the East-Raw of <HI>Spurrior-gate, Sadler-gate,</HI> and over <HI>Flesh-shambles,</HI> from the North-West Kirk-Stile of St. <HI>Nicholas</HI> unto <HI>Fish-shambles,</HI> and the said Raws opened either to the <HI>Cloth-market,</HI> or the <HI>Meal-market.</HI> This Tower was granted to it's Companies <HI>Anno</HI> 1619. The <HI>Ordinary</HI> was granted them 1536. In that it is order'd, that they shall go in Procession on <HI>Corpus Christi</HI> Day, and maintain the Play of the <HI>Three Kings of</HI> Colleign. In the Year 1700, this Tower was by the <HI>Plumb∣ers, Glaziers,</HI> &amp;c. made a beautiful Hall.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="26"/><HI>EVER-TOWER,</HI> which is now the <HI>Hall</HI> of <HI>Colliers</HI> and <HI>Carriage-Men,</HI> with <HI>Pavers,</HI> had in Ward the <HI>Shod-Frier-Yate,</HI> so going up that Raw beside <HI>White-cross</HI> unto <HI>Newgate,</HI> with all the <HI>Darnecrook,</HI> and with all the <HI>Gallow-gate</HI> without <HI>Newgate,</HI> unto the <HI>Barriers,</HI> as Men go to the <HI>Gallows.</HI></P>
<P><HI>ANDREW-TOWER,</HI> so called, because it is almost contiguous to St. <HI>Andrew</HI>'s Church, had in Ward from the Great <HI>Nun-gate,</HI> so upwards upon that East-Rawe, unto a Burn, beside <HI>Lam-place</HI> that runs to <HI>Lorkburne,</HI> with all the <HI>Cockstale-Booths,</HI> and with all the West-Rawe of <HI>Sidgate</HI> without <HI>New-gate</HI> from <HI>Gallows-gate</HI> unto the <HI>Water-Mill</HI> beside St. <HI>James</HI>'s Kirk.</P>
<P><HI>NEWGATE</HI> had in Ward all <HI>Ratten-Rawe,</HI> as it opens towards the Pil∣lory in <HI>Cloth-market,</HI> with them that dwell in the North of St. <HI>Nicholas</HI> upon that East-Rawe of the <HI>Cloth-market,</HI> unto the <HI>Over-dean-bridge</HI> end.</P>
<P>THIS Gate of all the others is not only the strongest, but also the most ancient. It is of the same Masonry and way of Building with that Part of the Wall which leads to <HI>Westgate</HI> Westward, as far as <HI>Ever-Tower,</HI> which is visibly the oldest Part of the Wall.

<P><HI>BERTRAM-MUMBOUCHER-TOWER.</HI> From <HI>Newgate</HI> towards the East we pass to the Tower of <HI>Bertram Mumboucher,</HI> which was so called from <HI>Bertram Mumboucher</HI> the Founder of it, <NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg">Ex Fuller Wor.</NOTE> who was <HI>High-Sheriff</HI> of the County of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> in the 49th of <HI>Edward</HI> the 3d, and in the 1st, 2d, and 3d of the Reign of <HI>Richard</HI> the 2d.</P>
<P>This Tower has to Ward all the West-end of <HI>Over-dean-bridge</HI> with the Shops between the <HI>Fish-shambles</HI> and the <HI>Beer-market,</HI> and from the same Bridge-end unto the Great <HI>Nun-gate.</HI></P>
<P><HI>FICKET-TOWER</HI> had in Ward from <HI>Whelpington-barn,</HI> beside the <HI>Great Cross</HI> standing within <HI>Maudlin-Barras</HI> without the <HI>New-yate,</HI> so com∣ing upon the East-Rawe of <HI>Sidgate,</HI> without the <HI>New-yate,</HI> unto the <HI>New-yate,</HI> and also within the <HI>New-yate,</HI> and so going up the East-Rawe Southward unto a Burne beside <HI>Lam-place,</HI> that runneth towards <HI>Lorkburn,</HI> with all <HI>Grey-Frier-Chare</HI> from the <HI>Barras</HI> over against <HI>Ficket-Tower,</HI> and their North Kirk Door of the said <HI>Fryery</HI> West-ward, and no further Eastward in that Lane.</P>
<P><HI>PILGRIM-STREET-GATE</HI> had it's Name from the <HI>Pilgrims</HI> who were wont to lodge in that Street, and go out of that Gate when they came to visit the Shrine of the Virgin <HI>Mary</HI> at <HI>Gesmunde;</HI> to which Place with great Confluence and Devotion they came from all Parts of this Land in these Times of Superstition. It is now the Hall of the Company of <HI>Joy∣ners,</HI> who repair'd it 1716, <HI>Thomas French</HI> and <HI>Paul Cook</HI> being Wardens. This Gate had in Ward without the same Gate beginning at the great waste Barn, call'd <HI>Emeldon-barn,</HI> opposite to the <HI>Maudlins,</HI> coming downward and inward upon that West-Rawe of <HI>Pilgrim-street-yate,</HI> within the <HI>Yate,</HI> and with∣in the <HI>Yate</HI> unto <HI>All-Hallow-Pant,</HI> besides <HI>Cordiner</HI>'s-<HI>place</HI> beside the <HI>South-Kirk</HI> Stile of <HI>All-Hallow</HI>'s <HI>Kirk,</HI> with all <HI>Painter-hugh,</HI> and with all <HI>Neither-dean-bridge,</HI> and with all the North-end of <HI>Upper-dean-bridge,</HI> both Sides thereof from <HI>Lorkburn</HI> Eastward to <HI>Pilgrim-street,</HI> with <HI>Pencher-rent,</HI> and in <HI>Grey-Fryer Lane</HI> from <HI>Ficket-Tower</HI> Eastward.</P>
<P>THE Tower next to this Gate is that in the Corner of the <HI>Carliol Croft,</HI> now the Hall of the <HI>Weavers</HI> who repair'd it <HI>Anno</HI> 1682. It got it's Name very probably from it's Founder: For the <HI>Carlills</HI> or <HI>Carliols</HI> were seve∣ral

of them Magistrates of <HI>Newcastle:</HI> and as this appears probable from the Name, so it is also equally probable that the Founder of this Tower had his House somewhere at the Head of <HI>Pilgrimstreet,</HI> nigh his own Tower, as <HI>Ne∣vel</HI>'s Tower was behind his House; and that the Field called vulgarly <HI>Carling Croft,</HI> had it's Name of <HI>Carliol Croft,</HI> being at that Time of Day the Property of this Founder. The last Mayor of this Town of that Name, before the Completion of the Walls, was <HI>Nicholas de Carliol</HI> in the 2d Year of <HI>Edward</HI> the 3d, so that this Tower could not be much later in Building, to say the least of it's Antiquity imaginable; but it is rather probable it was built a good while earlier. It has to Ward all the East Raw of <HI>Pilgrim-street</HI> within the Yate, and without the Yate, from and with the <HI>Maudlins,</HI> so coming inward upon the East-Raw, unto the <HI>Austin-Chair.</HI></P>

<P><HI>AUSTIN-TOWER;</HI> this Tower was built by the <HI>Fryers</HI> of <HI>St. Augu∣stine,</HI> commonly called <HI>Austine-Fryars,</HI> and has its Name from them.

<P><HI>CORNER-TOWER</HI> had in Ward all the House-side upon the Key, as their Doors open Southward towards the King's Wall upon the Key-side from the Stone Stairs beside the Common; so going East-ward upon the Key-side, to the South-end of <HI>Broad-Chare-Yate,</HI> in the said King's Wall.</P>
<P><HI>PAMPEDEN-YATE</HI> is so called from the <HI>Ancient Town of Pampeden,</HI> where was the <HI>Picts-Wall,</HI> and a <HI>Roman Turret,</HI> part of which is still to be seen.

<P>But with this a late ingenious Author cannot agree, because Mr. <HI>Cambden</HI> brings no Proof from Inscriptions, and also because <HI>Pancirolus,</HI> in the same <HI>Notitia</HI> places <HI>Vindomora</HI> at the ninth Station <HI>per Lineam Valli,</HI> where the fourth Cohort of the <HI>Galli</HI> lay, and which appears by Inscriptions to have been the <HI>Little Chesters upon the Wall;</HI> He con∣cludes therefore, that where the Wall begun, which has already been shown, the first Station of <HI>Segedunum</HI> was cer∣tainly placed. <HI>Gord.

by <HI>Bede, Villa ad Murum,</HI> <NOTE N="m" PLACE="marg"><P>This is cer∣tainly a Mi∣stake.

<P>But the learned Dr. <HI>Smith</HI> upon this Passage of <HI>Bede</HI> is of another Opi∣nion. He says, it is commonly supposed to be <HI>Walton,</HI> but this, he adds, can't be true.

<P>THIS Tower commonly called the <HI>Carpenters</HI> Tower, because the Com∣pany of Carpenters or Ship-wrights meet in it, was one of the Towers of the <HI>Old Romans.</HI> This Company in the Year 1716, built upon the under Part of it a very grand and stately <HI>Square-Tower,</HI> adorn'd at the Top Cor∣ners with 4 <HI>fair Turrets</HI> built in the form of a Lanthorn.</P>
<P><NOTE N="n" PLACE="marg">Lib. de Reb. Novocast'.</NOTE>BUT before the taking down the Top of the old Tower, it was much of the same Size, Model, and Stone with the Tower of <HI>Routchester</HI> in <HI>Northum∣berland,</HI> which was certainly one of the Towers belonging to the <HI>Picts-Wall.</HI></P>
<P>THERE is under it an ancient Postern-gate, which leads into the Field called the <HI>Garth-Heads,</HI> the most part of which was last Year enclosed and turned into Garden-ground, by <HI>Richard Ridley,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> the Owner of it.</P>
<P>FROM <HI>Sandgate,</HI> which is so called because, it was built upon the Sand, or the River-side, is a Wall, having many little Gates in it, extending itself as far as the <HI>Merchant</HI>'s Hall, along the Street called the <HI>Key-side.</HI></P>
<P>IT must not be forgot what is mentioned in the Manuscript of Mr. <HI>John Milbank,</HI> that between every one of these Towers, there were for the most Part 2 <HI>Watch-Towers</HI> made square, with the Effigies of Men cut in Stone up∣on the Tops of them, as tho' they were <HI>watching,</HI> and they were called <HI>Gar∣ret,</HI> which had Square Holes over the Walls to through Sones down.</P>
<P>WHEN these Walls were finished is not exactly found. <HI>Grey</HI> <NOTE N="o" PLACE="marg">Grey 7.</NOTE> seems to think they were finished some little Time before the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the 6th.</P>
<P>BUT this I imagine is a Date too late for the finishing of them; for <HI>Henry</HI> the 4th, in the 4th Year of his Reign, <HI>Aug.</HI> 16, granted at the Castle of <HI>Port-tefract,</HI> that all Fines, Redemptions, Amerciaments, Issues, Forfeitures and Profits, as well of Pleas as that of Justices of the Peace, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> be received by the <HI>Mayor</HI> and <HI>Burgesses</HI> of this <HI>Town</HI> and their <HI>Officers,</HI> for supporting, amending, and repairing the <HI>Walls, Bridges</HI> and <HI>Gates of the Town.</HI> The Walls then in this Reign must have been compleated, forasmuch as they then probably wan∣ted Repairs.</P>
<P>BUT further had <HI>Grey</HI> remembered his own Story above-mention'd, of the 300 <HI>valiant Men,</HI> that issued out at the <HI>White-fryer-gate,</HI> and put the <HI>Scottish Army</HI> to flight, he would surely have concluded that the Walls were finished before that Accident, which hapned in the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the 3d. Certain∣ly the <HI>Scottish</HI> Army, which is said to have been a great one, would not have
<PB N="18" REF="29"/>
lodged without the Town if they could have lodged in it, and what should hinder their lodging in it, but the Walls of the Town well guarded? I con∣clude therefore that the Walls of the Town at the latest were compleated in the Reign of King <HI>Edward</HI> the 3d, before the Year 1342 for it was in this Year that this Transaction hapned.</P>
<P>AFTER they were finished, it <NOTE N="p" PLACE="marg">Grey 27.</NOTE> was famous for being a Bullwark against the <HI>Scots,</HI> all the Power of <HI>Scotland</HI> could never win it, but of late, <HI>viz.</HI> in the Time of the Civil Wars, being assisted by the <HI>English,</HI> it was stormed, and our Churches and Houses defaced, and the Ornaments of both taken away.</P>
<P>IT is now going fast into Ruins, several of the <HI>Turrets</HI> and some of the <HI>round Towers</HI> being fallen; but the Towers which stand, together with some lit∣tle Parts of the Wall adjoining to them, are kept in good Repair by their respective Companies.</P>

<HEAD>Sect. I. <HI>Of the</HI> BLACK-FRYERS.</HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>Dominicans</HI> commonly called <HI>Black-Fryers, Preaching-Fryers,</HI> and <HI>Ja∣cobine Fryers,</HI> came over into <HI>England</HI> in the Year of our Lord <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Fuller C. Hist.</NOTE> 1221, or as others say, 1217, and had their first Residence in <HI>Oxford,</HI> they were a <HI>Prior</HI> and 12 <HI>Brethren;</HI> their Prior's Name was <HI>Gilbert de Fraxineto;</HI> the Name of the Order was taken from St. <HI>Dominick,</HI> born at <HI>Cologona</HI> in <HI>Spain:</HI> Of this Order were no sewer than fourscore famous English Writers.</P>
<P><NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">De reb. Novocast'.</NOTE>This Monastery was founded by Sir <HI>Peter Scott,</HI> who was the first Mayor of <HI>Newcastle, Anno</HI> 1251, and Sir <HI>Nicholas Scott</HI> his Son, who was one of the 4 Bailiffs of the Town, 1254, 1257, and <HI>Capital Bailiff,</HI> 1269; but the Site of it was given by 3 Sisters, whose Names have long since been ingratefully buried in Oblivion.</P>
<P>WHEN was the particular Time of it's Building, I have met with no Ac∣count; but it is not difficult to give a probable Guess; the Order itself of the <HI>Dominicans</HI> or <HI>Black-Fryes</HI> came into <HI>England,</HI> as is mentioned above, in the Year 1221; consequently it must have been founded after that Time: And that it must have been founded some Years before the Year 1280, is plain to a Demonstration. For in that Year, which was the Eight of <HI>Edward</HI> the First, the <HI>Black-Fryers</HI> had Licence from the King to break a Door through this <HI>New Wall,</HI> <NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg"><HI>Vid.</HI> Town Wall.</NOTE> into their Garden; which proves them a regular settled Body at that Time; and therefore that their Priory was built some Years before that Licence.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="31"/><NOTE PLACE="marg">Black-Fryers.</NOTE><NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">Grey 20.</NOTE>WE are told, that this Monastery was in old Time called the <HI>Grey-Fryers;</HI> which in my Opinion is a Thing highly Improbable; for the <HI>Grey-Fryers,</HI> or <HI>Franciscans,</HI> came not into <HI>England</HI> 'till about the Year 1224; and if as I have proved above, the <HI>Black-fryers</HI> were a Settled Body some Years before the Year 1280; how is it possible to have been called of old Time the <HI>Grey-Fryers?</HI> This is therefore a Mistake, and beside, the <HI>Dominicans</HI> came into <HI>England</HI> be∣fore the <HI>Franciscans</HI> or <HI>Grey-Fryers,</HI> and therefore more probably were sooner in this Place.</P>
<P>IT has been a very stately and Beautiful Building, as appears by the present Remains of it. The <HI>Area</HI> or <HI>Grass-plat</HI> is about 87 Foot in Length, and as many in Breadth; on the East Side of it was the <HI>Chapel,</HI> which is now the <HI>Hall</HI> of the Company of <HI>Smiths</HI> in this Town. On the West-side of it is a curious <HI>Old Well,</HI> which served the Monastery with Water, called our <HI>Lady's Well.</HI> On the South may still be seen the Ruins of a curious Front, on which Side is the <HI>Hall</HI> of the <HI>Cordwainers,</HI> in which I saw a Pair of winding Stairs, which they told me (before they were walled up) led by a Vault as far as the Nunnery of St. <HI>Bartholomew.</HI> On the North of it were their <HI>Gardens,</HI> a Part of which was the <HI>Warden</HI>'s <HI>Close,</HI> before the Building of that Part of the <HI>Towns-wall.</HI> This appears by the Charter granted to this Monastery in the Reign of <HI>Edward the first,</HI> about breaking out that <HI>Narrow-Gate</HI> in the Wall between <HI>Westgate</HI> and <HI>Newgate;</HI> in which Grant it is said, that the Wall went through the Middle of their Garden. This Monastery was dependant upon the Priory of <HI>Tinmouth.</HI></P>
<P>IN the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the 2d, the Brethren of this Monastery had Li∣cense granted them for the Building of a <HI>Drawbridge,</HI> beyond the <HI>New Ditch</HI> of the <HI>Castle.</HI></P>
<P>WHO were the <HI>Priors</HI> of this Monastery, what eminent Men belonged to them, or what Things were transacted by them from their Beginning 'till their Dissolution, were Things undoubtedly preserved among themselves whilst they were a Body; but, after their Surrender, were either destroy'd, or have not yet come to Light.</P>
<P>ONE of the Priors of this Monastery was one <HI>Richard Marshall.</HI> I take this Gentleman to have been the last <HI>Prior</HI> of this Monastery, for in the 28th of <HI>Henry</HI> the 8th, a Grant of a Tenement, nigh the White-Cross, (signed by Fryer <HI>Richard Marshal,</HI> Dr. and Prior; and Fryer <HI>David Simpson,</HI> and Fryer <HI>John Sowrby</HI>) was given to <HI>Anthony Godsave,</HI> upon his paying to the said Pri∣ory or Monastery 9 <HI>s.</HI> per Ann. This Grant is now in the Possession of Mr. <HI>Thomas Marshal,</HI> of <HI>Newcastle,</HI> Joyner, who purchased this Tenement, and has lately rebuilt it. He pays the same Rent to the Town of <HI>Newcastle,</HI> which the Tenement pay'd to the Monastery.</P>
<P>ABOUT 2 Years after the Signing of this Deed, in <HI>January</HI> the 30th of this Reign this Monastery surrendered; it consisted of a <HI>Prior,</HI> and <HI>Twelve Fryers.</HI></P>
<P>THE Nature of surrendering was this, according to Bishop <HI>Burnet,</HI> who says, <NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg"><HI>Burnet</HI>'s Records, p. 146.</NOTE> at the surrendring of Monasteries and Abbies, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> there was generally a Confession along with the Surrender.

<PB N="21" REF="32"/>
and other like papistical Ceremonies, wherein we have been most principally practised, and Nose-led in Time past; but the very true Way to please God, and to live a true Chri∣stian Man, without all Hypocrysie and feigned Dissimulation, is sincerely declared to us by our Master Christ, his Evangelists and Apostles; being minded hereafter to follow the same, conforming ourselves to the Will and Pleasure of our Supreame-head, under God, on Earth, the King's Majesty, and are not to follow henceforth the superstitious Traditions of any Forensecal Potentate or Power, with mutual Assent and Consent, do submit ourselves unto our said Sovereign Lord, and with the like Assent and Con∣sent do surrender,</HI> &amp;c.

<P>WHAT became of the Brethren of this our Fryery, after their Surrender, what they had allowed them annually for a Maintenance, or whether they had any Thing allowed at all, I have no where met with. Some Account indeed I meet with afterwards of the <HI>Prior</HI> himself, but none of the <HI>Fryers.</HI> It is this which follows.</P>

Some Doctors of the <HI>University</HI> being disgusted at this Assertion, prevailed with one <HI>Tofts,</HI> a <HI>Grey-Fryer,</HI> to undertake to prove that the <HI>Pater-Noster</HI> might be said to the <HI>Saints;</HI> whose Ignorance in doing the same was so manifest, that he became the common Jest, and quitted the Town.</P>
<P>AFTER the Surrender of the Monastery on <HI>Jan.</HI> the 10th, 30th of <HI>Henry</HI> the 8th, the <HI>Black-Fryers</HI> was granted to the Town of <HI>Newcastle,</HI> in Conside∣ration of 53 <HI>l.</HI> 7 <HI>s.</HI> 6 <HI>d.</HI> The annual Value of it, was 2 <HI>l.</HI> 19 <HI>s.</HI> 6 <HI>d.</HI></P>

And a Close containing 3 Acres, and a House in the same Close without the Walls of the said Town, and a House called the <HI>Gate-house,</HI> situated near the Street.</P>
<P>IT also appears from the Grant, that the King reserved to himself and Suc∣cessors, the <HI>Bells</HI> and <HI>Lead</HI> that was upon the Church belonging to this Fryery, and the other Buildings of it; the Lead in the Gutters, together with the Stones and Iron of the Church, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>THE Nine Crafts of this Town had their <HI>Meeting-houses</HI> or <HI>Halls</HI> in it, and still have, except two of them, the <HI>Taylors</HI> and the <HI>Cordwainers,</HI> who have be∣stowed these upon some poor Widows, and got themselves others in other Places. These Halls are of great Service to this ancient Building, in preserv∣ing it from an entire Ruin. Such is the Hall of the <HI>Smiths,</HI> which was re∣paired by them in the Year 1709, <HI>John Kellet, Thomas Turner, Jonathan Gib∣son, Roger Haddock</HI> being Wardens; The Hall of the <HI>Dyers,</HI> The Hall of the <HI>Bakers</HI> and <HI>Brewers,</HI> which was repair'd <HI>Ann'</HI> 1711, <HI>Christopher Rutter, Lionel Dixon, William Dove, John Make-piece,</HI> being then Wardens: These Halls are on the East-side of the Fryery. Such also are those on the West-side of it, viz. the Hall of the <NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg">This Company has be∣longing to it, an ancient Manuscript, beautifully wrote, in Old English Rhime; it relates to our Saviour's Sufferings. I take it to be the play they were obliged by their Ordinary to maintain on the Feast of <HI>Corpus Christi.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Sadlers,</HI> which was repair'd by them in the Year 1729, <HI>Cuthbert Berkley</HI> and <HI>Matthew Anderson,</HI> Wardens; and the Hall of the <HI>Skinners</HI> and <HI>Glovers,</HI> which was repaired by them in the Year, 1712, <HI>John Emmerson, Robert Barnes, Robert Shutt, Philip Smith</HI> being Wardens. Such are those al∣so on the South-side of it, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Cordwainer</HI>'s Hall, which was turned into Appartments for three Widows, in the Year 1729, <HI>John Wheatley</HI> and <HI>George
<PB N="22" REF="33"/>
Alder</HI> being Wardens; the Hall of the <HI>Butchers,</HI> and the Hall of the <HI>Tanners,</HI> was repair'd in the Year 1717, <HI>Thomas Anderson, William Harrison, Thomas Dixon, William Slaiter</HI> then Wardens.</P>
<P>BY Means of these Halls, there is still some Visage of the Fryery remain∣ing, which had otherwise been intirely in the Dust. 'Tis a Pity that those People who are permitted by the Companies to reside in some of those Rooms are not threatned into more Cleanliness, and that the Companies themselves are not at the Expence of repairing the Area; were these Things done, it would be a Beautiful Piece of Antiquity, and an Entertainment to the Cu∣rious, from whencesoever they came.</P>

<HEAD>Sect. II <HI>The</HI> VICARAGE.</HEAD>
<P>IN coming back by the narrow Lane which led to the <HI>Black-fryers,</HI> we face a little Street called <HI>Fennel Street,</HI> which leads into <HI>Westgate;</HI> a Street more retired than any other in this Town; there being no Artificers or Me∣chanicks in this Street, nor any Market. It is chiefly inhabited by the <HI>Clergy</HI> and <HI>Gentry;</HI> and indeed it seems all along to have been inhabited by such more than by others. In some Writings above 400 Years old, we meet with the Names of some <HI>Clergy-men</HI> who lived in this Street, <HI>viz. Robertus de Gonwerton, Thomas Abelot, &amp;c.</HI> not to mention those who belonged to the Monasteries and Hospitals; and <HI>Grey</HI> tells us, that the Men who lived in this Street in his Time, had Employment for both Town and Country, he says also that in old Time the Earl of <HI>Westmoreland</HI> had his House in this Street.</P>
<P>AT present several of the Houses in it, are large and beautiful; such are the Houses of the Lady <HI>Clavering,</HI> of <HI>Utrick Whitfield,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> <HI>Thomas Ord,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> Mr. <HI>Abraham Dixon,</HI> &amp;c. in the Upper Part of it; and of <HI>George Grey,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> and others adjoining to him in the lower Parts of it.</P>
<P>ON the North Side of this Street, a little above St. <HI>John</HI>'s Church, is the <HI>Vicarage</HI> House, the Dwelling of the <HI>Vicars</HI> of <HI>Newcastle.</HI> It stands, at least e∣qually pleasant with the other Houses in this Place, being situated in the mid∣dle of Fields and Gardens, and more retir'd, being at some Distance from the Street.</P>
<P>WHO it was that built this House, I have not been able to learn; but 'tis not improbable that it was the Town of <HI>Newcastle,</HI> who has been al∣ways famous for it's Generosity to it's Clergy; as the Vicarage itself in par∣ticular must always acknowledge. It is at present more beautiful and conve∣nient than it was wont to be, having been repair'd and enlarged in the Year 1694, by the Rev. and Worthy Dr. <HI>Ellison,</HI> the then <HI>Vicar.</HI></P>
<P>THERE is a <HI>Hall</HI> belonging to this House, built in a very grand and state∣ly Manner, according to the Hospitality of the Times it was built in. In particular, it was the Place where the <HI>Vicars</HI> of <HI>Newcastle</HI> were wont to en∣tertain the inferiour Officers of Churches, the <HI>Clarks, Sextons, &amp;c.</HI> at the Season of <HI>Christmas.</HI> If I am not very much mistaken, there are many still living, who remember this laudable Custom.</P>
<P>The <HI>Garden</HI> belonging to this House, tho' beneath some others in this Street for Art and Curiosity, and Beauty of Flowers; yet in this it glories above all the others, that the <HI>Roman-Wall,</HI> which was undoubtedly one of the great Works of the <HI>Roman Empire,</HI> is said to have passed through the middle of it.</P>

<HEAD>Sect. III. <HI>Of St.</HI> JOHN's CHURCH.</HEAD>
<P>THIS Church is situated almost close to the Vicarage. It is dedicated to St. <HI>John the Baptist;</HI> but who was the Founder I never met with: I am inclinable to believe it was founded by the <HI>Towns-people,</HI> notwithstanding a Conjecture of an <HI>Anonymous Gentleman,</HI> which is, that <HI>Robert Rhodes</HI> was the Builder of this Church. But this I think is impossible; for the earliest he can be supposed to have lived, is about the Year 1430, in the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the 6th, when <HI>John Rhodes,</HI> who was perhaps his Father, was Mayor; whereas it is certain this Church was built at least an Hundred Years before. For the Grant of <HI>Adam</HI> of <HI>Durham,</HI> to the the Priest of St. <HI>Thomas</HI> the Martyr's <HI>Chan∣tery</HI> in this Church, bears Date the 26th of <HI>March,</HI> 1319, in the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the 2d; consequently then the Church must have been in being at this Time, and so could not have been built by <HI>Robert Rhodes.</HI> Nay, in a Charter dated 1287, belonging to the Rev. Mr. <HI>Smith</HI> of <HI>Melsomby,</HI> to whom I have been obliged for a Sight of a great many Writings, I meet with these Words, <HI>Venellum quo itur ad Ecclesiam Sancti Joannis.</HI> So that this Church was still earlier in Being, <HI>viz.</HI> in the 15th of <HI>Edward</HI> the 1st. However, it is supposed that the <HI>Steeple</HI> of this Church was either built, or at least beautified by him, as also the <HI>South-Cross</HI> of the Church; for his <HI>Coat of Arms,</HI> as also these Words, <HI>Orate pro Anima Roberti Rhodes,</HI> are upon both of them; which indeed makes it somewhat probable.</P>
<P>THIS Church, as <HI>Grey</HI> informs us, was commended by an <HI>Arch-Prelate</HI> of this Kingdom, because it resembleth much a <NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg">Churches were usually built in form of the Cross, to represent and comme∣morate the Cross on which our Lord died.</NOTE> <HI>Cross;</HI> which indeed it does more than any other in this Town.</P>
<P>THERE were three <NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg">Chanteries consisted of Salaries al∣lowed to one or more Priests to say daily Masses for the Souls of their deceased Founders, and their Friends. These were Adject∣ives, not able to stand of themselves, and therefore united (for their better Support) to some parochial, Collegiate, or Cathedral Church. <HI>Ful. Ch. Hist. p. 350.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Chanteries</HI> belonging to this Church, one of which was the <HI>Chantery</HI> of <NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg"><HI>Sciant presentes, &amp;c. quod Ego</HI> Adam de Dunelm', Burgensis Villae Novi Castri super Tynam, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> pro sa∣lute Animae meae, &amp; pro animabus <HI>Rogeri</HI> patris mei, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> hac presenti Carta Mea confirmavi <HI>Domino Ro∣gero de Burneto Capellano</HI> — Singulis diebus ad altare Beati <HI>Thomae</HI> Martyris in <HI>Ecclesia Parochiali Sancti Joannis de Novo-Castro</HI> divina Celebraturo; totum illud messuagium, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Et volo quod post decessum meum, <HI>Major &amp; Ballini praedictae villae Novi-Castri,</HI> quicunquae pro tempore suo fuerint, habeans Jus patronatus dictae <HI>Cantariae,</HI> &amp; quod ipsi nun cum quatuor de Prebioribus &amp; Discretioribus hominibus Parochiae praedictae ad hoc E∣loctis possint ad dictam Cantariam, quotrescunque ipsam Vacatam contingat, vtrum capellanum Honestum, Discre∣tum, er Honestum eligere &amp; instituere, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE> St. <HI>Thomas</HI> the Martyr, which was founded about <HI>Anno</HI> 1319, in the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the 2d. For <HI>Adam</HI> of <HI>Durham,</HI> Burgess of this Town, (according to the Opinion of the Times he liv'd in) for the Sake of his <HI>own Soul,</HI> and the Souls of his Father <HI>Roger,</HI> and <HI>Agnes</HI> his Mother, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> gave an annual Salary to <NOTE N="l" PLACE="marg"><P>Such Priests as have the Addition of <HI>Sir</HI> before their Christian Name, were Men not graduated in the Uni∣versity; being in Orders, but not in Degrees; whilst others intitled <HI>Masters,</HI> had commenced in the Arts. Note, that generally Founders of Chanteries preferred Priests not beneficed to those Places, as best at Leisure constantly to attend the same. <HI>Fuller C. Hist. p. 352.</HI></P></NOTE> Sir <HI>Roger de Burneton,</HI> the <HI>Chantry-Priest,</HI> for cele∣brating Divine Service every Day, at the <HI>Altar</HI> of St. <HI>Thomas</HI> the Martyr, in <HI>this Church.</HI> I take this Chantry to have been situated on the North Side of the said Church, extending as far as, and adjoining close to, the <HI>North-Cross</HI> of the Church.</P>
<P>WHEN this Priest of the Chantry dyed, another was to be chosen (after the Decease of the Benefactor <HI>Adam</HI>) by the <HI>Mayor</HI> and <HI>Bailiffs</HI> of this Town for the Time being, together with four of the most discreet, and judicious Men of the Parish of St. <HI>John</HI> elected for that Purpose. The <HI>Mayor, &amp;c.</HI> had
<PB N="24" REF="35"/>
also the Power of turning out the Priest of this Chantry,<NOTE PLACE="marg">St. <HI>JOHN's</HI> Church.</NOTE> and putting another in his stead, if he neglected his Duty upon any Canonical Impediment, be∣yond 40 Days. If he was taken with a Fit of Sickness, he was obliged to provide another at his own Expence to wait upon the Altar. They had a Power also of turning him out, and putting another in his Stead, if any Scan∣dalous Crime was proved upon him.</P>
<P>THIS Writing was sealed by the Seal of the Benefactor, and the <HI>Common Seal of the Town of Newcastle;</HI> and Witnessed, by <HI>Richard de Emelden,</HI> then Mayor, <HI>Thomas de Frismarisco, Richard de Acton, William de Burneton, Gilbert de Hankyn,</HI> Bailiffs of the Town, Sir <HI>Nicholas Scot,</HI> Knight, <HI>Nicholas de Car∣leol, Thomas de Carleol, Peter Graper,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>THE yearly Value of this Chantry was 4 <HI>l.</HI> 3 <HI>s.</HI> which was raised out of certain Tenements in the <HI>Sandhill</HI> and <HI>Westgate.</HI></P>
<P>ANOTHER Chantry belonging to this Church, was that of <HI>our Lady,</HI> founded by <HI>Edward Scott,</HI> in the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the 3d; the yearly Value of which was 4 <HI>l.</HI> 4 <HI>s.</HI> 4 <HI>d.</HI> which arose out of Tenements in the <HI>Sandhill</HI> and <HI>Westgate.</HI></P>
<P>THE 3d Chantry was that of the <HI>Holy Trinity,</HI> founded by <HI>John Dalton, William Atkinshawe,</HI> and <HI>Andrew Accliffe,</HI> Clerks; the yearly Value of which was 5 <HI>l.</HI> 13 <HI>s.</HI> 4 <HI>d.</HI> which arose out of Tenements in <HI>Westgate, Side,</HI> without <HI>Westgate,</HI> and a Close without <HI>Westgate.</HI></P>
<P>I have been told, that the <HI>Painted Glass</HI> on one of the South Windows of the Quire of this Church, had on it the Representation of the <HI>Trinity.</HI> It does indeed still resemble some such Thing, but, if the Knowledge of it was need∣ful, it might be Queried whether it ever was any such Representation.</P>
<P>THERE is another Thing at the Top of this Quire, which tho' little known, is yet of greater Certainty; and that is, the <HI>Funnel,</HI> or <HI>Wood Box,</HI> in the Form of a <HI>Spout,</HI> which hangs from the Top of this Quire. This was a Conveyance for an Artificial <HI>Dove,</HI> on the Day of <HI>Pentecost,</HI> in the Times of Popery, to represent the <HI>Descent of the Holy Ghost.</HI> That there were such Things in Churches, tho' in none that I know of in this Town, but this; is Matter of Fact. For thus we are told, that <NOTE N="m" PLACE="marg"><P>Bee-Hive of the Romish Church.</P>
<P><HI>Geo. Geld∣ing,</HI> p. <HI>207.</HI></P></NOTE> on <HI>Whitsunday</HI> the Papists be∣gin to play a new interlude. For then they sent down <HI>a Dove</HI> out of an <HI>Owl</HI>'s <HI>Nest,</HI> devised in the <HI>Roof</HI> of the Church. But first they cast out <HI>Rosin</HI> and <HI>Gunpowder</HI> with <HI>Wild-fire,</HI> to make the Children afraid; and that must needs be the Holy Ghost, which cometh with Thunder and Lightning.</P>
<P>THERE was formerly an <HI>Organ</HI> in this Church. This appears from the last Will and Testament of Mr. <HI>John Wilkinson,</HI> Merchant of this Town, who was one of the Ancestors of the present Mr. <HI>John Wilkinson</HI> Merchant, to whom I am obliged for a Sight of this Will. It bears Date <HI>Feb.</HI> 1, 1570, and has these Words, <HI>I, Iohn Wylkinson, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> commend my Soule unto Almyghtie God, and my Bodye to be buryed in Saincte Iohn-Church, on the Northe Syde of the same Church, nygh where the Organes doithe stande.</HI> A little below this he thus orders, <HI>I wyll have the dyvyne Service at the Daye of my Buryal, according to the Lawes and Custome of this Realme.

<P><NOTE N="n" PLACE="marg"><HI>M. S.</HI> Mil∣bank.</NOTE>IN the Year 1639, when the <HI>Scots</HI> sought to deface the ancient Monu∣ments, and said they were Papistry, and Supestition, they began with the Spoon of this Church's Font, and broke it all to Pieces. It had been given by one <HI>John Bertram.</HI> For there was written about it; <HI>For the Honour of God and St.</HI> John, John Bertram <HI>gave this Font Stone. Cuthbert Maxwell,</HI> a

<P>THE <HI>Porch</HI> of this Church was rebuilt in the Year 1710, <HI>Thomas Fletcher; Robert Percival, John Quincy, John Fairlam</HI> being then <HI>Church-wardens.</HI> In the Year 1723, the Steeple was new pointed at the Expence of the Corpora∣tion, <HI>Matthew Featherstone,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> being then Mayor; and the same Year was the Body of the Church pointed at the Charge of the Parishioners. There are two <HI>Galleries</HI> in this Church; one on the West-End of the Church, and the other on the North-Side. The <HI>Latter Gallery</HI> was built in the Year 1710, for 33 Persons, by Mr. <HI>Robert Percival,</HI> Pin-maker, of this Parish, who was a great Lover of the Church, and an industrious Promoter of every good De∣sign towards Her. In the Year 1707, when the Parishioners took down the 3 old Bells belonging to this Church, and contributed to the 6 they have at present; Mr. <HI>Percival</HI> contributed three Pounds.

<P>THE <HI>Minister</HI> of the Church is the Curate and <HI>Lecturer</HI> of it.

<P><HI>ROBERT Urguart,</HI> who suffered in the Beginning of the <HI>Civil-Wars.</HI> He afterwards went beyond the Seas, turn'd <HI>Papist,</HI> and dyed in a Convent.</P>
<P><HI>JOHN Shaw.</HI> He was the Son of a <HI>Clergyman,</HI> born at <HI>Bedlington,</HI> was first of <HI>Queen</HI>'s <HI>College;</HI> from whence he removed to that of <HI>Brazen-Nose</HI> in <HI>Oxford.</HI> In the Year 1645, he was both instituted and inducted to the Re∣ctory of <HI>Whalton,</HI> but not permitted to enjoy it. However, with much ado he afterwards got the Church of <HI>Bolton</HI> in <HI>Craven</HI> in <HI>Yorkshire:</HI> Which being but half the Value of <HI>Whalton,</HI> they allowed him to keep it.</P>
<P>IN 1661 he returned to <HI>Whalton;</HI> was made Preacher also of the Parish Church of St. <HI>John</HI>'s in <HI>Newcastle;</HI> twice chosen a Member of the <HI>Convocati∣on</HI> for <HI>Yorkshire;</HI> and if I mistake not, served once for the <HI>Clergy</HI> of the <HI>Arch∣deacoury</HI> of <HI>Northumberland.</HI> He was a Man of good Learning and of an un∣blameable Life, a strict Observer of the Orders of the Church: Somewhat warm in his Temper; equally zealous against <HI>Popery</HI> and <HI>Presbytery,</HI> with it's Brood of Sectaries; as appears by his Writings: The <HI>Gout</HI> confin'd him to his House, and at last to his Bed, some Years before his Death. He bore his Affliction with Christian Fortitude; being patient, resign'd, and chearful un∣der it; more solicitous for God's Church than for himself, and died in a good old Age, in the Year 1689. I had almost omitted to say, that he was impri∣soned no less than <HI>four Years by the Rebels.</HI></P>

<HEAD>The <HI>CHARITY-SCHOOL</HI> of this Parish.</HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>Charity-School</HI> of St. <HI>John</HI>'s consists of <HI>Forty four</HI> poor Boys, but no Girls, and was endowed by the late Mr. <HI>John Ord,</HI> in the Year 1705, which Matter was transacted between him and Dr. <HI>Thomlinson,</HI> whom he con∣sulted and made privy to his Design, but enjoyn'd to Secrecy; and the Foun∣der
<PB N="29" REF="40"/>
of that School was not known 'till after his Death. He gave towards supporting it a <HI>large Close</HI> without <HI>Pilgrim-street-gate,</HI> called <HI>Great Magdalen Close,</HI> alias the <HI>Mill-Close,</HI> which is held by Lease of the <HI>Master</HI> and <HI>Brethren</HI> of St. <HI>Mary Magdalen</HI> Hospital, under the Rent of 4 <HI>l. per Annum.</HI> The Close is Lett at 25 <HI>l.</HI> so that the neat Rent to the School is only 21 <HI>l.</HI></P>
<P>MRS. <HI>Margaret Allgood,</HI> Widow, by Will dated the 15th of <HI>July</HI> 1707, devised to this School 100 <HI>l.</HI> to be put out at Interest, and which is accord∣ingly put out at Interest for the Benefit of this School.</P>
<P>AND there is annually raised by Subscription towards the Maintenance of this School 33 <HI>l.</HI> 14 <HI>s.</HI></P>
<P>THE Master's Salary is 24 <HI>l. per Annum</HI> and 40 <HI>s.</HI> for teaching the Boys to sing, and 16 <HI>s. per Annum</HI> for Pens, Ink, and Paper.</P>
<P>THE Subscriptions were raised to cloath the Boys, and to bind them out Apprentices; but the Endowment being short of paying the Master, part of the Subscriptions are applied that Way.</P>
<P>THE School-house was provided by, and is repaired at, the Expence of the <HI>Corporation.</HI></P>
<P>THE Boys are supplied with Hose, and Shoes twice a-Year, (to wit) <HI>Mid∣summer</HI> and <HI>Christmas,</HI> and with a Coat, Shirts, Bands, and Cap, once a-Year only, at <HI>Midsummer.</HI></P>
<P>THE Anniversary Sermon is preached on the Sunday next after the 24th Day of <HI>June,</HI> being the Feast of St. <HI>John Baptist.</HI></P>
<P>THE School is to be governed by the Heir of Mr. <HI>John Ord,</HI> the <HI>Mayor</HI> of <HI>Newcastle,</HI> the <HI>Vicar,</HI> the Forenoon Lecturers of <HI>All-hallows,</HI> St. <HI>John</HI>'s, and St. <HI>Andrews,</HI> and the Afternoon Lecturers of St. <HI>Nicholas</HI> and <HI>All-hallows,</HI> or any five of them, and they have the chusing of a <HI>Master.</HI></P>
<P>THE Rules and Orders for the better governing of the School, and dire∣cting the Choice of a Master, and his Qualifications, were made by Mr. <HI>Ord</HI> the Founder, and approved by Dr. <HI>Thomlinson,</HI> to whom he communicated his Thoughts from Time to Time by Letter, and those Letters, with the Do∣ctor's Answers, are transcribed in the School-Books.</P>

<HEAD>Sect. IV. St. MARY<HI>'s Hospital.</HI></HEAD>
<P>OPPOSITE to St. <HI>John</HI>'s, on the other Side of the Street, is the Hos∣pital of St. <HI>Mary</HI> the <HI>Virgin,</HI> which contains two Foundations, an Old one,<NOTE N="o" PLACE="marg">Lib. Cart.</NOTE> and a New one; as they were call'd upon the Founding of the latter. The old one must have been founded, not many Years after the <HI>Nunnery</HI> of St. <HI>Bartholomew,</HI> which was founded by King <HI>Henry</HI> the First: For in a Char∣ter granted by King <HI>Henry</HI> the Second, to the <HI>Nuns</HI> of St. <HI>Bartholomew,</HI> there is mention made of St. <HI>Mary</HI>'s in this Town, as may be seen in our Account of <HI>these Nuns.</HI> But this Conjecture will be more confirm'd, if it be consider'd that a Charity was bestow'd on <HI>this Hospital</HI> by the Lord <HI>Walter de Bolbeck,</HI> (as is mention'd below) who,<NOTE N="p" PLACE="marg">Gib. Camb. p. 855.</NOTE> as we are told, in a Charter dated the first Year of King <HI>Stephen,</HI> convey'd some Lands to the Church of <HI>Winchester.</HI> If this was the same <HI>Walter</HI> with him below, and there appears nothing to the con∣trary; then it is a strong Reason, that <HI>this Hospital</HI> was founded in King <HI>Henry</HI> the First's Reign. The latter <HI>Hospital</HI> and <HI>Chapel,</HI> were founded by one <NOTE N="q" PLACE="marg"><P>Ego Ase∣lack de Kil∣lynghowe fundavi Ho∣spitale San∣cta' Mariae Virginis &amp; Capellam super Ter∣ram meam, in <HI>Novo Ca∣stello</HI> super Tynam, &amp; ibi posui duos fratres regulares &amp; unum Capellanum ad serviandum Deo &amp; pauperibus; reddidi meipsum Deo &amp; Beatae Mariae &amp; Fratribus eju<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dem Hospitalis ibidem Deo serventibus, ad Hospitandum Pauperes, &amp; egenos Clericos, &amp; Peregrinos transeuntes pro Salute animae.

<P>WE learn also from the same Charter, that the Founder devoted himself to God and Religion, as he himself says, (according to the Way of that Age) I render my self to God, and the Blessed Virgin <HI>Mary;</HI> and the Brethren of the same Hospital there serving God; to do Works of Hospitality to the Poor,
<PB N="31" REF="42"/>
the <HI>Needy Clergy</HI> and <HI>Pilgrims.</HI> And this, he says, he does for his own Soul,<NOTE PLACE="marg">St. <HI>MARY</HI>'s Hospital.</NOTE> for the Soul of his Father and Mother, and his other Relations; together with the Souls of all the <HI>Benefactors</HI> of the Hospital.</P>
<P>SOME of the Witnesses to this Foundation Charter, were <HI>Gilbert,</HI> Parson of <HI>Eland, Richard,</HI> Parson of <HI>Standfordham, Waldon</HI> Parson of <HI>Newburne, Eusta∣chius,</HI> Parson of <HI>Benton.</HI></P>
<P>THE particular Time when it was founded can't be exactly learned; there being no Date at the Charter. But it is probable from a Charter of King <HI>Richard</HI> the First, that it was founded some little while before he began to Reign; for when he confirms the <NOTE N="r" PLACE="marg">Sciatis me dedisle &amp; concessisse Domino &amp; Sanctae Ma∣riae &amp; San∣ctimoniali∣bus de <HI>Novo Castello,</HI> pro salute Ani∣mae meae &amp; antecesso∣rum meo∣rum, <HI>Aselack Burgeum me∣um de Novo Castello,</HI> &amp;c. Lib. Cart.</NOTE> Foundation of <HI>Aselack,</HI> he speaks of him as then living, otherwise he would not call him <HI>his Burgess</HI> of <HI>Newcastle,</HI> as he does in the Charter.</P>
<P>WE meet also with an Account of a Third Foundation belonging to this <HI>Hospital,</HI> which Account is this. The <HI>Hospital</HI> of our <HI>Lady,</HI> called <HI>Westgate Spittle,</HI> was founded by the Inhabitants of <HI>Newcastle,</HI> for a <HI>Master</HI> and <HI>Chaplain</HI> to say Divine Service for 6 <HI>Bede Folks</HI> in the <HI>Alms-house,</HI> and to lodge <HI>Poor</HI> and <HI>way-faring People,</HI> and to <HI>bury</HI> such as hapned to die there, and to distribute yearly <HI>Nine Chaldron</HI> of <HI>Coals</HI> among poor People. The yearly Value of this was 33 <HI>l.</HI> 15 <HI>s. De Rebus Novocast'.</HI></P>
<P>AFTER the founding of this <HI>Hospital</HI> and <HI>Chapel,</HI> there were several Dona∣tions and Charities bestowed upon it, as had been before upon the old one; some of the <HI>Benefactors</HI> of both which, and Masters among a large Number which might be mentioned, are these following.</P>

<P>IN the 24th of the Reign of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> the Hospital of St. <HI>Mary</HI> in <HI>Westgate,</HI> and St. <HI>Mary Magdalene</HI> without <HI>Pilgrim-street-gate,</HI> were granted to <HI>Theophilus Adams</HI> and <HI>James Woodshaw,</HI> under the yearly Rent of 3 <HI>s.</HI> 4 <HI>d.</HI></P>
<P>IN the 9th of King <HI>James</HI> the First, a Charter was granted for the Hospi∣tal of St. <HI>Mary</HI> the Virgin.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Grammar-School</HI> of this Town, which is now at <HI>West-spittle,</HI> was ori∣ginally founded by <HI>Thomas Horsly,</HI> who was <HI>Mayor</HI> of <HI>Newcastle,</HI> in the Year of our Lord 1525. By his last Will he devised all his Lands in <HI>Newcastle,</HI> af∣ter the Death of him and his Wife, to erect a <HI>Grammar-School,</HI> which was to be free for any one within and without the Town, in the Manner directed by the said Will.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="45"/>BUT in the Year 1559 it was removed from St. <HI>Nicholas</HI>'s Church-yard, (from that House which is on the North Side of the Church, over that Place where the <HI>Privy</HI> now is,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>M. S.</HI> Mil∣bank.</NOTE> where it had been from the Time of it's Institution) to the <HI>West-spittle.</HI> The Reason of which was this, Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> ordain∣ed and granted, that within this Town of <HI>Newcastle,</HI> and the Liberties there∣of, there should be erected, and for ever there be, one <HI>Free Grammar School,</HI> which should be a <HI>Free Grammar-School</HI> of Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> in <HI>Newcastle,</HI> and should consist of one <HI>Master</HI> and <HI>Scholars,</HI> to be instructed in the same, and that they, the <HI>Master</HI> and <HI>Scholars</HI> of the same, should for ever be <HI>one Body Corporate in Law, Fact,</HI> and <HI>Name,</HI> by the <HI>Master</HI> and <HI>Scholars</HI> of the <HI>Free Gram∣mar-School,</HI> of Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> in <HI>Newcastle</HI> upon <HI>Tyne, &amp;c.</HI> and by that Name should have perpetual Succession, and should be in perpetual Times to come able and capable in the Law, of having, purchasing, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Lands, Tenements, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to them and their Successors, in Fee-simple, or for Term of Years, so they exceed not the yearly Value of 40 <HI>l.</HI> and so they were not holden of the <HI>said Queen,</HI> her Heirs and Successors in chief, nor by <HI>Knight-Service.</HI> And that the <HI>Mayor</HI> and <HI>Burgesses</HI> of <HI>Newcastle,</HI> and their Successors, or the greater Part of them, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> should have Power to make an honest, learned and discreet Man to be the First and <HI>Modern Usher</HI> in the said School, there to continue during the good Pleasure of the said <HI>Mayor</HI> and <HI>Burgesses, &amp;c.</HI> and that if the said <HI>Ma∣ster</HI> and <HI>Usher</HI> should die or leave the said School, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> then they might chuse other Men to be <HI>Master</HI> and <HI>Usher, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>IT is very probable that the Town of <HI>Newcastle,</HI> who always presented a <HI>Master</HI> to this <HI>Hospital,</HI> as it did to St. <HI>Mary Magdalen</HI>'s and St. <HI>Thomas</HI> the <HI>Martyr</HI> upon <HI>Tyne-Bridge,</HI> did at this Time make the Master of the <HI>Grammar-School,</HI> Master also of the Hospital. <HI>Grey</HI> tells us, that the <HI>first Master</HI> of the <HI>head School,</HI> was the Rev. Master <HI>Robert Fowberry,</HI> a learned and painfull Man, to indoctrinate Youth in Greek and Latin: To be sure he was the first Ma∣ster after the Removing of the <HI>School</HI> to the <HI>West-spittle.</HI> For undoubtedly there were Masters before that, as the School was so much earlier founded; And accordingly in the Manuscript above-mentioned, 'tis said, that when Mr. <HI>Burras</HI> gave over the the <HI>Free-School</HI> in St. <HI>Nicholas</HI> Church-yard, the Mayor and 24 more sent for Mr. <HI>Fowberry</HI> to <HI>Hull,</HI> and he came and first taught in the <HI>Writing-School,</HI> until the <HI>Chapel</HI> of St. <HI>Mary</HI>'s <HI>Hospital</HI> was made into a <HI>School-house,</HI> and the <HI>Election-house</HI> was at the East-end of it, which had been the <HI>Vestry;</HI> But Sir <HI>George Selby</HI> who was then <HI>Mayor,</HI> set up his Arms on the <HI>East-Window,</HI> made a <HI>Traverse</HI> over it, and sent to <HI>London</HI> for 24 <HI>Chairs</HI> of <HI>Mustinie Leather,</HI> and there is the Election, tho' the Mayor lays down his Staff in the <HI>old School.</HI></P>

<HEAD>Sect. V. EARL <HI>of</HI> WESTMORELAND<HI>'s House.</HI></HEAD>
<P>NEXT to St. <HI>Mary</HI>'s, on the same Side of this Street, is a very old Buil∣ding, which was lately the Dwelling-house of Sir <HI>Robert Shaftoe,</HI> K<SUP>t</SUP>. <HI>Recorder of this Town,</HI> now the Property and Dwelling-house of Mr. <HI>Charles Clark,</HI> Jun<SUP>r</SUP>. It has the Magnificence and Grandure of Antiquity in it's Looks, but what it has been formerly I could never find out. <HI>Grey</HI> tells us, That in this Street the Earl of <HI>Westmoreland</HI> had his House, which indeed is true. It was built by the Baron of <HI>Bywell</HI> and <HI>Bolbeck,</HI> about the 9th of <HI>Edward</HI> the Third. Much about the same Time he built a House within the Bounds of the <HI>Castle,</HI> for the Defence of it, as may be seen in our Account of the <HI>Castle.</HI> This House in <HI>Westgate</HI> was called <HI>Bolbeck-Hall;</HI> but afterwards, upon it's Founder's being created <HI>Earl,</HI> which was in the Reign of <HI>Richard</HI> the Second, in the Year 1398, when <HI>Ralph Nevil,</HI> Lord of <HI>Raby</HI> was created <HI>Earl Mar∣shall,</HI> it got the Name of <HI>Westmoreland-Place</HI> in <HI>Wesgate.</HI> Some have conje∣ctured, that Sir <HI>Robert Shafto</HI>'s House, above-mentioned, was part of it, and
<PB N="36" REF="47"/>
indeed it looks much liker a Part of such a Building,<NOTE PLACE="marg">E. Westmor∣land<HI>'s house.</HI></NOTE> than any other Thing remaining thereabouts. I am sure much more so than the House which is supposed to have been it, which I am told was the House opposite to the West End of <HI>Denton-Chair,</HI> which the Rev. Mr. <HI>Cowling</HI> lately lived in, and which belongs to Mr. <HI>Ord.</HI></P>
<P>HOWEVER, be this as it will, whether it was this House now mention∣ed, or whether <HI>Westmoreland-Place</HI> reached from this House to Sir <HI>Robert Shafto</HI>'s, including it, which some have conjectured; yet this is certain, that it must have been hereabouts: for <HI>Nevil Tower</HI> is directly behind this Piece of Ground we are speaking of, which is a sure Token this must be the very Place, because, whoever in the Town built a Tower at their own Expence, it was generally nigh them for their own Security. Thus the <HI>White-Fryers;</HI> the Brethren of St. <HI>Mary</HI>'s Hospital; the Brethren of St. <HI>Austin,</HI> &amp;c. Built their Towers over against their <HI>Monasteries,</HI> for their own Safe-guard and Se∣curity. But what I think puts it out of Dispute, that Sir <HI>Robert Shafto</HI>'s House was no Part of it, is that in the Eleventh of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> upon the Attainder of <HI>Charles,</HI> Earl of <HI>Westmoreland,</HI> this House where Mr. <HI>Cow∣ling</HI> lived, was in Charge, which the other never was, before the Auditors; and in the Third of <HI>Charles</HI> the First, was sold to the Citizens of <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">Lib. de re∣bus Novo∣cast.</NOTE>IT was afterwards in the Tenure of <HI>James Bertram,</HI> and after that in the Tenure of <HI>Robert Bertram.</HI></P>
<P>OPPOSITE to this House, is a Chair or Lane, called <HI>Denton</HI>-Chair, which leads into the <HI>Groat-Market, Middle-street,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>THIS Street is continued 'till you come to the Street leading Westward to the <HI>Postern,</HI> and Eastward to the <HI>Back-raw:</HI> From thence the Street changes it's Name, and is called <HI>Tuthill,</HI> 'till you come to the <HI>Tuthill Stairs,</HI> which lead into the <HI>Close.</HI></P>

<HEAD>Sect. VI. BAILIFF GATE.</HEAD>
<P>ON the East-Side of this Street, is a Street facing the West-side of the <HI>Castle,</HI> called <HI>Bailiff Gate,</HI> which is said to have got it's Name from the Coming of the <HI>Fellons,</HI> of the County of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> along that Street at∣tended by the County Bailiffs. They came, as is said, to the <HI>Westgate,</HI> then down an old Way, close by the Out-side of the <HI>Town-Wall,</HI> and so in at the <HI>White-Fryer Gate,</HI> from whence they went along <HI>Bailiff Gate,</HI> and so were conveyed in at the <HI>Postern-Gate,</HI> on the West-Side of the <HI>Castle,</HI> opposite to this Street of <HI>Bailiff Gate.</HI> This is only Traditional, and has been therefore deny'd by the Town of <HI>Newcastle. Grey</HI>'s Account is, That at this Gate the Prisoners were brought in, who were taken in Times of Hostility with <HI>Scot∣land,</HI> and carry'd from thence privately into the Castle, where the Goal for the County is now.</P>
<P>THE same Author also tells us, that this Street of <HI>Bailiff Gate,</HI> formerly belonged to the <HI>Castle</HI> and County of <HI>Northumberland.</HI> But I imagine, had this been true, the <HI>King</HI> would long ago have had his Right. The Town of

<HI>Newcastle</HI> indeed has sometimes been made uneasy about that,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bailiff-gate.</NOTE> but still had it surer fixed to her, as her undoubted property.</P>

<P>IT is probable that hereabouts was the ancient <HI>Monkche∣ster,</HI> where the <HI>Monks</HI> and religious Men inhabited. This appears from a Place in this Street, <HI>viz. That Row of Houses</HI> which stands almost in the Middle of the Street, called to this Day the <HI>Huckster</HI>'s <HI>Booths:</HI> For the People who dwelt in these Houses, were <HI>Hucksters,</HI> and supplied the Religious Houses with Provisions.

<P>NOW this, I think, is a sufficient Proof that these Upper Parts of the Town were first inhabited by the <HI>Monks,</HI> the Lower Parts, as far as the <HI>Ca∣stle Yard,</HI> were the Habitations of the <HI>Town's People:</HI> The <HI>Castellum,</HI> or For∣tification having been thereabouts, from the Beginning of <HI>Hadrian</HI>'s Wall, as we are inform'd, by a <NOTE N="x" PLACE="marg"><P>Mr. <HI>Horse∣ly</HI> of <HI>Mor∣peth,</HI> who dy'd a few Months ago, a little before the publishing of his <HI>Roma∣na Britannia,</HI> the Book re∣ferr'd to.</P>

Britt. 132.</HI></P></NOTE> <HI>late ingenious Author.</HI> He says there must have been a <HI>Station in this Town,</HI> for these Reasons: If we consider the Importance of this Place, it's Distance from the first Station at the End of the Wall, and the Turns the Wall makes, (especially at the East Side of the Town) in Or∣der to it's passing through the Heart of it; we can scarce Question but there has been a Station here: And it's old Name of <HI>Monk-Chester</HI> seems to put it out of Doubt. The former Part of the Name is taken from the Settlement of the <HI>Monks</HI> in this Place, and the latter Part from the Word <HI>Castra,</HI> which is a pretty sure Mark of a Station: Besides the Name <HI>Newcastle,</HI> (given first
<PB N="40" REF="51"/>
to the Castle it self, and then to the Town) has been thought to imply (as in other Instances) that there was an old <NOTE N="y" PLACE="marg">Vid. Chap. <HI>of the</HI> Castle.</NOTE> Castle or Fort there before, and near the Place where the <HI>new One</HI> was erected. And as this <HI>Newcastle</HI> was built by <HI>Robert,</HI> Son of <HI>William</HI> the Conqueror, the <HI>old Castle</HI> must have been undoubtedly <HI>Roman.</HI> And some Years ago, a Coin of <HI>Vespasian</HI> was found near the Castle, as I was told by the Person himfelf that found it.</P>
<P>THE same learned Author goes on thus: The next Thing is to determine the Boundaries and Situation of this Station, which I persuade my self may be done. I hinted before that there was a Traditionary Account of the Walls passing through St. <HI>George</HI>'s Porch, near the North West Corner of St. <HI>Ni∣cholas</HI> Church. But it is certain that the Line of the Wall lies a little to the North of this End of the Church, and I think has not touched this Porch, tho' it comes near it. And therefore I conjecture, that the Wall which has passed through this Porch, must have been the East Rampart of the Station; for the Supposition will reconcile these seemingly differing Accounts: And if a Line be erected Perpendicular to that of <HI>Severius</HI>'s Wall, so as to pass thro' that Porch, and be continued along the Brow of the Hill, at the Head of the Side, 'till it meet the Line of <HI>Hadrian</HI>'s <HI>Vallum,</HI> near the East End of <HI>Balygate,</HI> and not far from the Castle. This Line seems to answer so well in Respects, that I cannot much Doubt it's having been the Eastern Limits of the ancient Station: For this brings the Station near to the Castle, which probably has been built a little more to the South East, in order to bring it nearer to the Top of a Steep Hill. And fixing the Eastern Boundary of the Station here, leaves a Plain and Level Area for the Station it self, and with∣out it, a Descent towards the South and the River, for the Town to stand upon, which might extend it self to the Bridge, supposing the ancient Bridge to be near the same Place where the present one stands: From which Bridge the ancient Town and Station might probably take the Name of <HI>Pons-Aelii</HI> This Eastern Boundary of the Station must at that Time have been near∣er the River, than it is now now; since 'tis certain, that the River formerly flowed farther up towards this Part of the Town. The Position of the Ea∣stern Rampart of the Station being thus determined, the other Boundaries may be also defined; for the Distance here between the Lines of the Walls seems to be about six Chains; and it is not much to be questioned, but the two Walls here, (as in other Cases they frequently did) have fallen in with the Northern and Southern Ramparts of the Station; so that these six Chains have been the Breadth of the Station. And if we suppose the Station to have been of a middle Size, we must make it a Square, and allow six Chains for the length of it. If at this Distance another Line be drawn equal and Parallel to the former, and between the Lines of the Wall, it will be the Western Boun∣dary of the Station, as the two respective Parts of the two Walls make the Northern and Southern Limits. And upon this Supposition, a Line drawn from the Foot of the <HI>Flesh-market</HI> to <HI>Baily-gate,</HI> near the east End of it, will be the Eastern Limits of the ancient Station. That Part of the <HI>Vallum</HI> which reaches from <HI>Baily-gate</HI> to Mr. <HI>Ord</HI>'s House, will be the Southern Limit; and a Line drawn from hence, to that Part of the Line of <HI>Severus</HI>'s Wall, which is about thirty Yards East from the End of <HI>Rosemary-lane,</HI> must be the We∣stern Boundary, and the Part of <HI>Severus</HI>'s Wall included between this and the Foot of the <HI>Flesh-market,</HI> remains for the Line of the Northern Rampart.</P>

<P><NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">De Reb. Novocast'.</NOTE>IT is supposed to have been built by one of the Kings of <HI>Scotland. David</HI> King of <HI>Scots</HI> is mention'd in particular as it's Founder; but for what Rea∣son I know not. Indeed, that <HI>David,</HI> who dy'd in the Year 1153, was a great Benefactor to <HI>Churches</HI> and <HI>Religious Houses,</HI> and he is said in particular to have founded in this Town <NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Collier Ec∣cles.</NOTE> two <HI>Religious Houses,</HI> but there is not a Word of his being the Founder of St. <HI>Andrew</HI>'s, which in all Probability would as soon have been taken Notice of, and handed down to Posterity, had it been true; as the Building of two <HI>Religious Houses.</HI> But besides, if St. <HI>Andrew</HI>'s be the oldest Church in this Town, and this I think ought to be allowed for the Reasons already given, as also from the constant Tradition of it's being so, then it is undoubtedly older than St. <HI>Nicholas</HI>'s, and if so, it must have been built before the Time of <HI>Henry</HI> the First; for St. <HI>Nicholas</HI>'s was built in that Reign, at latest; and therefore it will follow, that this Church of St. <HI>Andrew</HI>'s was built before <HI>David</HI> King of <HI>Scots</HI> was born.</P>
<P>I am therefore rather inclinable to believe, that it was founded by the <HI>Town's People,</HI> and the <HI>Religious Houses,</HI> which at that Time of Day were chiefly in those higher Parts of the Town.</P>
<P>THERE were three <HI>Chanteries</HI> belonging to this Church; one of which was dedicated to our <HI>Lady,</HI> which was of the Yearly Value of 6 <HI>l.</HI> 12 <HI>s.</HI> 10 <HI>d.</HI> No Deed of Foundation is shewed, but however it must at least have been founded in the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the First; for in the latter End of that Reign, in a Charter which one <HI>Roger Amyas</HI> granted to one <HI>Stephen</HI>—, it is order∣ed, that he shall have such a particular <HI>Booth</HI> for the Term of 30 Years: Pro∣vided he pay so much to the <HI>Tyne Bridge,</HI> and to the <HI>Altar</HI> of St. <HI>Mary</HI> in the <HI>Church</HI> of St. <HI>Andrew</HI>'s in <HI>Newcastle</HI> upon <HI>Tyne.</HI></P>
<P>IT had a House of <HI>Seven Shillings</HI> per Annum belonging to it; it abutted on the North, next to the <HI>New-gate</HI> and on the East on the <HI>High-street,</HI> on the West on St. <HI>Andrew</HI>'s Church-yard, and on the South on a Tenement, which in the Nineteenth Year of the Reign of Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> belonged to <HI>Robert Hallyman.</HI></P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Had the Curiosity lately to search among the Old Writings in your Vestry, for that famous <HI>Indulgence,</HI> which is said to have been <NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">Vid. Grey. p. 12.</NOTE> granted to your Church by the Pope for <HI>Nine thousand Years to come;</HI> but found no such Thing.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="53"/>THERE is however another Indulgence which discovers a Piece of Anti∣quity, relating to your Church, which I chused to acquaint you with in this Manner, that the ancient Name of a Part of your Church, now worn out of the Memories of our <HI>Towns-men,</HI> and almost intirely lost, might again be brought to light.</P>
<P>THIS Indulgence was granted in the Reign of King <HI>Richard</HI> the Second, in the Year 1392, an Age in which Indulgencies were common, and when they were of Particular Service towards the Building or repairing of Chur∣ches. For at that Time of Day, when the Building, or repairing, or adorn∣ing of a Church was requisite, an Indulgence was granted for such a Term of Years or Days, to all such as would be assisting in the Things aforesaid; by which Means many Churches have been built, repair'd and beautified, and accordingly this Indulgence of yours was granted partly for the same End, that the Church of St. <HI>Andrew</HI>'s might be kept in sufficient Repair: For it promi∣ses an Indulgence or Pardon for <NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">Qui ad re∣parationem, seu orna∣mentum sive emendatio∣nem Eccle∣siae Sancti Andreae vil∣lae Novoca∣stri super Tynam, lin. 5<SUP>0</SUP> Indul. — Quadraginta dies Indul∣gentiae con∣cedimus.</NOTE> 40 Days to every one, who shall con∣tribute towards the repairing or beautifying of the Church of St. <HI>Andrews</HI> in <HI>Newcastle</HI> upon <HI>Tyne;</HI> and then follows the Antiquity design'd.</P>
<P>THAT whoever <NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg">Ac Capellae Sanctae Tri∣nitatis in parte Aqui∣lonari ejus∣dem Eccle∣siae aurum argentum, &amp;c. Lin. 6<SUP>0</SUP> Indulg'.</NOTE> offers or sends, or Causes to be sent to the <HI>Chapel of the Holy Trinity in the Northern Part of the same Church,</HI> either Gold, Silver, Vest∣ments, Books, Chalices, or any other Ornaments, which are wanting to the aforesaid <HI>Chapel,</HI> or <HI>Altar,</HI> or Image of the <HI>Holy Trinity,</HI> which is in the same Chapel. — Or who shall fall down upon their Knees before the <HI>Image</HI> of the <HI>Holy Trinity,</HI> aforesaid, and pray for the Health of Sir <HI>Adam de Athol,</HI> Kn<SUP>t</SUP> as long as he lives, and for his Soul after his Decease, and for the Soul of the Lady <HI>Mary</HI> his Wife, whose Body lies buried in the same <HI>Chapel</HI> of the <HI>Holy Trinity,</HI> shall, as often as they perform those Things, or any of the Things before-mention'd, have the Benefit of a <HI>Forty Days Indulgence.</HI></P>
<P>NOW from this it is observable, that that waste Place in the <HI>Northern Isle,</HI> which opens into the Quire must be the <HI>Chapel</HI> here spoken of. For there lies the Body of Sir <HI>Adam</HI>'s <HI>Wife,</HI> which is said in the Indulgence to be buried in the <NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">Et pro Anima Do∣minae Mariae sponsae suae cu∣jus Corpus in eadem Capel∣la sanctae Tri∣nitatis Qutes∣cit. <HI>Lin. 9. Indulg.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Chapel of the Holy Trinity;</HI> as also the Body of Sir <HI>Adam</HI> himself. The Building itself is after the Manner of Chapels, which were added to parish Chur∣ches; and it is still observable, that at the Top of the North Window in the Chapel there seems to be a Picture of the Holy Trinity, represented according to the Superstition of these Times by the face of <HI>an old Man, our Saviour upon the Cross,</HI> and the Figure of a <HI>Dove;</HI> it having been always Customary in these Times, not only to have the <HI>Image of the Saint</HI> set up to whom the Church was dedicated, but also to adorn the Windows with it.</P>
<P>I am of Opinion, that Sir <HI>Adam de Athol</HI> himself was the Founder of this Chapel, and my Reasons for it are these,</P>
<P N="1">1st, It was customary formerly for People of better Figure, to build a small Chapel, at a convenient Part of their parish Church, that they might have a convenient Place to Worship God in, or that it might be a burial Place for them and their Families. Now it is evident, that this Chapel of the <HI>Holy Trinity</HI> is such a one. For if you suppose the Chapel away, the Church it∣self will appear exactly uniform; which shews the <HI>Chapel</HI> has been added to the Church; and as Sir <HI>Adam</HI> and his <HI>Lady</HI> are buried in it, is pretty clear that They were the Founders. It may also be presumed, that <HI>He</HI> built it, be∣cause it seems to have been built when Sir <HI>Adam</HI> liv'd: For it is said in the Indulgence to want Books, Chalices, Vestments, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which implies it, at that Time, to have been <HI>a new Chapel.</HI> And besides, Indulgences were gran∣ted towards the adorning of Churches or Chapels, immediately after they were built. This Chapel was therefore built a little before the granting of this In∣dulgence, which was when Sir <HI>Adam</HI> was living. And as his Wife was then
<PB N="43" REF="54"/>
dead and buried in this Chapel; so she seems to have been the first that was buried in it, and consequently her Husband must have built it.</P>
<P>BUT my last Reason, I think, makes it amount to a Demonstration. It may be observed in all Indulgences of this Kind, that it was not only requir'd of the People to offer Church Ornaments, but also to put up Prayers for the Founder. Thus for Instance; in an Indulgence granted in the Reign of King <HI>Henry the Eighth</HI> for the Repairing and Maintaining of the Church and Convent at <HI>Kirby Belers</HI> in the County of <HI>Leicester,</HI> it was not only required that Money should be given, but that they should also say a <NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg">Stavely <HI>Ch. Hist.</HI> pa. 100.</NOTE> <HI>Pater Noster</HI> with an <HI>Ave</HI> for the Souls of Sir <HI>Roger Beler</HI> and <HI>Alyce</HI> his Wife, Founder and Foundress.</P>
<P>NOW from hence it is plain, that Sir <HI>Adam</HI> and his <HI>Lady</HI> must have been the Founder and Foundress of this Chapel, because they alone are men∣tioned in this Indulgence, and Prayers were to be put up for them, as they were for Sir <HI>Roger</HI> and his Lady just now mentioned.</P>
<P>THUS I think I have found out the ancient Name of your Chapel, and who was the Founder it. It may perhaps be somewhat Satisfactory to those who are curious in those Things, may retrieve the antient Name of your Cha∣pel, and establish the deserved Remembrance of it's Founder. But be this as it will; as I have only these Things in View in making these Observations; so I hope you'll be so good as to accept of them, and allow them a Place a∣mong the Parchments of your Church.</P>

<P>THE Indulgence on which these Observations are founded are granted by <HI>Oswald,</HI> the Bishop of <HI>Candida casa,</HI> which is in <HI>Gallaway</HI> in <HI>Scotland;</HI> it is dated at <HI>York</HI> 1392, the 12th Year of his Consecration.</P>
<P>THE 3d <HI>Chantery</HI> belonging to this Church was dedicated to St. <HI>Thomas.</HI> This I learn from an Account I have met with of a House in this Street, which is said to have belonged to the <HI>Chantery</HI> of St. <HI>Thomas,</HI> in the Church of St. <HI>Andrew</HI>'s.</P>
<P>IT bounder'd on the West by St. <HI>Andrew</HI>'s Church end, and on the North by a <HI>House,</HI> which in the Reign of Q. <HI>Elizabeth</HI> was in the Possession of <HI>Richard Atkinson,</HI> and on the East by the <HI>High-street,</HI> and on the South against the <HI>Church-Style.</HI> It was valued at ten Shillings per Annum.</P>
<P>THAT there was such a Chantery in St. <HI>Andrew</HI>'s (notwithstanding the two former are supposed to be all belonging to this Church) is further evident, because I meet also with an Account which says, that the Chantery of St. <HI>Thomas</HI> in St. <HI>Andrew</HI>'s, had an Orchard belonging to it, which paid a yearly Rent of Three Shillings and Four Pence to it; but where it stood is not men∣tioned. It was occupied by Sir <HI>Robert Brandlin.</HI></P>
<P>THAT there were Lands belonging to the Chantery of St. <HI>Mary</HI> in this Church, which were situated in this Street, is certain. But where to fix them at this Time of Day is pretty Difficult. But wherever they were situa∣ted,
<PB N="44" REF="55"/>
there was an House situated near them, which paid to the <HI>Priory</HI> of <HI>Hex∣ham</HI> Six Shillings per Annum.</P>
<P>THIS is mention'd when <HI>Rowland</HI> was Prior, in the Year 1490, in the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the 7th.<NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg">De Reb. Novocast'.</NOTE></P>
<P>I meet with no account of the Lands belonging to the Chantery of the <HI>Tri∣nity,</HI> except that of an House, situated in a Place called <HI>le Cow-garth</HI> in this <HI>Newgate-street,</HI> which paid one Shilling per Annum to this Chantery, and a Tenement in <HI>Westgate</HI> which paid 4 <HI>s.</HI> 4 <HI>d.</HI></P>
<P>THE Altar of this Church is very pretty and decent, it was beautified a few Years ago at the Charge of the Parish.</P>
<P>THERE is at the <HI>West-end</HI> of this Church a <HI>Beautiful</HI> Gallery, which was built in the Year 1711, at the Charge of the Parish. In the Year 1726, the <HI>Old Porch</HI> was taken down, and the present one built,

<HEAD>Sect. II.</HEAD>
<P>ON the East-side of this Street, near the <HI>New-gate,</HI> is a Tenement which was given by Mrs. <HI>Alice Belaysys</HI> to <HI>University-College</HI> in <HI>Oxford.</HI> The Site of it is thus describ'd; <HI>Situatum est infra praedictam villam juxta Novam Portam ejusdem villae in quo quidem Tenement'</HI> Thomas Gray Lidster <HI>modo inha∣bitat, (viz.) Inter Tenementum</HI> Roberti Daunt <HI>ex parte Boreali, &amp; vicum Ducen∣tem ad fratres minores ab Ecclesia Sancti</HI> Andreae <HI>ex parte australi;</HI> But the same Writing goes further, <HI>ac Tria Tenementa &amp; duo Tofta, inde in simul situantur in eodem vico ducente a dicta Ecclesia Sancti</HI> Andreae <HI>usque Fratres praedictos, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>OPPOSITE to St. <HI>Andrew</HI>'s Church is a Lane, which leads to <HI>Pilgrim∣street</HI> Gate, called the <HI>High-fryer-chare,</HI> because of a Fryer which was in it, and because it is higher up in the Town than the other Fryer Chare.</P>
<P>IN coming down this Street Southward from the Church of St. <HI>Andrew</HI>'s, on the Right-hand, is an ancient Street called <HI>Darn-crook;</HI> in which Street were some Wastes and House belonging to the Nuns of St. <HI>Bartholomew,</HI> as there were in almost every Street in the Town. Opposite to this Place, on the East-side of this Street of <HI>Newgate</HI> is a little running Water which goes into <HI>Lorkburne.</HI> This little <HI>Bourn</HI> is taken Notice of in the Account of the Ward belonging to <HI>Ficket-Tower,</HI> and is called there, <HI>a Bourn beside Lam-place, that runneth towards Lorkburne.</HI> To this Bourn it is, that the Prisoners belonging to <HI>Newgate,</HI> have Liberty to walk during the Time they are not confin'd to the Goal.</P>
<P>FROM thence, going still Southward, the Street changes it's Name from <HI>Newgate</HI> to <HI>Huxter</HI>'s <HI>-Booths;</HI> for thereabouts it was that the <HI>Huxters</HI> lived, as has been observed above, who supply'd the <HI>Religious-houses,</HI> and the other Peo∣ple of this Part of the Town with Provisions. A Part of these Houses are still to be seen, they stand by themselves almost in the <HI>middle of the Street,</HI> nigh the <HI>White-cross. Grey</HI> says, That this Part of the Town was in his Time called the <HI>Huxters-Booths;</HI> that is, as I understand him, from the <HI>Bourn</HI> above∣mentioned, to those Houses.</P>
<P>OPPOSITE to the <HI>Booths</HI> was a great Gate that led into the <HI>Black-fryers.</HI> It was situated between the House of <HI>William Wilkinson,</HI> Smith, and the House of <HI>Elizabeth Bell,</HI> Widow. The Place now is the Entrance of a Garden be∣longing to Mr. <HI>Nicholas Baily</HI> of <HI>Newcastle.</HI> This I think is evident from a Grant of a Tenement from the <HI>Black-fryers,</HI> now in the Hands of Mr. <HI>Tho. Mar∣shall,</HI>
<PB N="48" REF="59"/>
of this Town; wherein in describing the Situation of the Tenement, are these Words; <HI>Sicut jacet in villa antedicta prope crucem vulgariter vocatam</HI> Whytt∣cross <HI>inter magnam portam praedictorum Fratrum e Regione praedictae crucis ex parte Boreali,</HI> &amp;c. The Tenement described is the House lately rebuilt by Mr. <HI>Mar∣shall</HI> aforesaid. Since this Conjecture from the Writing above-mentioned, I have met with the Manuscript of Mr. <HI>Milbank,</HI> which very much corroborates it. The Words are these; the Gate-way to this House was from the White∣cross, and was called when our Author liv'd, <HI>Wind</HI>'s <HI>-hole.</HI> The way was a narrow Lane to the Fryery, which in his Time was joining to Mr. <HI>Brandling</HI>'s Ground, whereupon there was, (and still is) a Mill.</P>
<P>THE Business and Trade of this upper Part of the Street, is chiefly that of the <HI>Tanners.</HI></P>
<DIV4 TYPE="subsection">
<HEAD>WHITE-CROSS.</HEAD>
<P>FROM the <HI>Huxters Booths</HI> to almost the <HI>Nun-gate,</HI> the Street changes it's Name again, for the Name of the <HI>White-Cross,</HI> because of a <HI>Cross</HI> which stood there; to which, from the <HI>Huxster</HI>'s <HI>Booths,</HI> was the ancient Market of this Town, as there is at this Day at the <HI>Cale-Cross.</HI> This <HI>Cross</HI> was pulled down that very Night after Sir <HI>George Selby</HI> dyed, and King <HI>James,</HI> of Sacred Memory, <HI>March</HI> 24.<NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg">Milbank, <HI>M. S.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>ON the Place where the Cross stood was a Cistern for receiving of that Water, which goes by the Name of the <HI>New-Water.</HI> This was lately pulled down, and there is now in the Place where the Cross was, a Pillar of Stone∣work. The Street hereabouts is wide and spacious, and having in it several good Buildings; such are the Houses of <HI>William Carr,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> <HI>Thomas Clennell,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> <HI>&amp;c.</HI> There are four Fairs kept in this Street in the Year, one at <HI>Lammas</HI> for Horses, and another at St. <HI>Lukesmass</HI> for Horses: The other two are for <HI>Black-Cattle,</HI> the one on <HI>All-Souls Day,</HI> and the other at <HI>Martinmas.</HI></P>
<P>NEAR the Cross is a Lane called the <HI>Low-fryer-chare;</HI> it got the Name of <HI>Fryer-chare</HI> from it's being situated near the <HI>Black-fryers,</HI> and of the <HI>Low-fryer-chare;</HI> because it is not so high up the Town as the other <HI>Fryer-chare.</HI></P>
<P>IT was also called formerly <HI>Shod-fryer-chare,</HI> because the <HI>Black-fryers</HI> were also called <HI>Shod-fryers.</HI></P>

<DIV3 N="3" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Sect. III. NUNN-GATE.</HEAD>
<P>FROM the <HI>White-cross</HI> Southward the Street leads to the <HI>Nun-gate,</HI> which gives Name to a small Part of the Street thereabouts.</P>
<P>THIS Gate was not the <HI>Great-gate</HI> of the <HI>Nunnery,</HI> but a back Passage to it; for <HI>Nunnery</HI> was situated lower down, as may still be seen by the Ruins of some old Walls in their Garden: Probably it was situated about the Place where Mr. <HI>Hebdon,</HI> a few Years ago built a large House, which is built upon the same Ground where the <HI>old stone House</HI> stood, inhabited by Mr. <HI>Green,</HI> which seem'd to have been built out of the Ruins of this <HI>Nunnery.</HI> Here it was that King <NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg">Speed <HI>Hist.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Henry,</HI> the First founded the Hospital of St. <HI>Bartholomew</HI> the <HI>Apostle,</HI> for the <HI>Nuns</HI> of <HI>Newcastle.</HI> In <NOTE N="l" PLACE="marg"><P>H.

after they were founded,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nuns of St. <HI>Bartholo<SUP>w</SUP>.</HI></NOTE> which I take to be a Charter of King <HI>Henry</HI> the Second's, they had all the Things bestowed upon them, confirmed: The 20 <HI>Acres</HI> mentioned in the Charter I have not been able to find out. A Manu∣script of Mr. <HI>Joshua Douglas</HI>'s says, that probably all that Side of the Street, from the <HI>Nuns</HI> to <HI>Newgate,</HI> belonged to these <HI>Nuns,</HI> for their Garden reaches to <HI>High-fryer-chare.</HI> This indeed is highly propable, for the nine Tofts or Crofts confirmed to them in this Charter, seem to be a good Proof of the Truth of it.</P>
<P>IN the Garden which belong'd to them, call'd still the <HI>Nun</HI>'s <HI>-Garden,</HI> is a <HI>low Square Vale,</HI> at the South West Corner of which Tradition says, there is a <HI>Vault,</HI> which leads to the <HI>Black-fryers.</HI> Mr. <HI>Richmond,</HI> the present Stew∣ard of Mr. <HI>Blackett,</HI> told me, he had seen the Entrance into it; but that now it was fill'd up with Earth.</P>

<P>12<SUP>0</SUP> <HI>Die</HI> Septemb. <HI>Anno</HI> 2<SUP>0</SUP> Caroli <HI>Regis Compertum post Mortem</HI> Nicholai Tempest, <HI>de</HI> Stelley, <HI>in Com'</HI> Dunelm' <HI>Milit' &amp; Baronet' Quod fuit Seissatus de &amp; in Manerio de</HI> Stellingley, <HI>al's Vocat'</HI> Stelley, <HI>situat' Stant' &amp; existen' prope aquam de</HI> Tyne <HI>in Parochia de</HI> Ryton, <HI>in Ep'tu</HI> Dunelm' <HI>cum suis Juribus, Membris &amp; Pertinenciis Universis: Ac de omnibus terris arabilibus Pratis, Pas∣cuis, Pasturis, Boscis, Subboscis, Communiis, Piscationibus, Mineris Carbonum, infra solum &amp; Fundum ibidem comoditatibus, Prosicuis, emolumentis, &amp; aliis advantagiis, eidem Manerio de</HI> Stellingley, <HI>al's</HI> Stelley, <HI>pertinentibus Vel Ullo modo Spectanti∣bus Nuper parcello Possessionum Domus five Monasterii S.</HI> Bartholomei <HI>infra Villam</HI> Novi Castri <HI>super</HI> Tinam <HI>Dissoluti.</HI></P>
<P>THERE were, as is observed above, Wastes and Houses, in the <HI>Side,</HI> in <HI>Pilgrim-street,</HI> in the <HI>Flesh-market, Oat-market, Darncrook,</HI> and almost all the Town over, which belonged to the <HI>Nuns.</HI> The Piece of Ground above the <HI>Town-moor,</HI> called from them the <HI>Nun-moor,</HI> belonged to them. Mr. <HI>Riddle</HI>'s House and Chapel in <HI>Gateside,</HI> (commonly called <HI>Gateside-house</HI>) was, according to some, a Sort of Infirmary for the <HI>Nuns</HI> of this Hospital.</P>
<P>DR. <HI>Smith,</HI> in his Ecclesiastical History of <HI>Bede</HI> <NOTE N="m" PLACE="marg"><P>Ubi nulla remanent antiqui mo∣nasterii Ut∣tani: vestigia Resentio∣ris quidem, Pulcherri∣niam vide∣mus Capel∣lum vix ad∣huc Ruinis Succumben∣tem. Tra∣ditio est, cel∣lam fuisse sanctimoni∣alium No∣vocast rentium, licet ejus Historiam apud Autores vix inveneris. Smith in Not' Bed. lib. 3. C. 21.</P></NOTE> says, that in <HI>Gateside</HI> there are no Footsteps remaining of the ancient <HI>Monastery</HI> of <HI>Uttanus;</HI> but of a more Modern one, we see a most beautiful Chapel, which is not as yet in Ruins. There is a Tradition that this was a Cell of the <HI>Nuns</HI> of <HI>Newcastle,</HI> tho' we cannot readily Quote any Authority for it.</P>
<P>THE Tradition mention'd by these Gentlemen appears somewhat probable, for in the Charter before-metioned the <HI>Nuns</HI> of St. <HI>Bartholomew</HI> received two Shillings annually from this Cell.</P>
<P>IT is also not improbable but St. <HI>Mary</HI>'s Hospital in <HI>Westgate,</HI> was also a Cell to this Nunnery: It appearing plainly from the Charter above, that St. <HI>Mary</HI>'s was dependant on it.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="61"/>AND it's said in <HI>Leland,</HI> that the Hospital of St. <HI>Mary</HI> in <HI>Newcastle</HI> upon <HI>Tyne</HI> was given to the Use of <HI>these Nuns.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Lel. Vol. 1. p. 41.</NOTE></P>
<P>IT appears also from the Charter just above-mentioned, that among the other Things confirmed to this <HI>Hospital,</HI> the Church of St. <HI>Bartholomew</HI> was one. I may be ask'd therefore where this Church was Situated. In answer to this I dare venture to say, that there never was any such Church in this Town; I mean a Parish Church: And therefore it must have been the Church or <HI>Chapel</HI> belonging to this Hospital; and consequently must have been seated where the Hospital was. And this appears to be the rather true, because we have no other mention made of their <HI>Chapel,</HI> and because when it is mention'd in the Charter it is said to be given them, that they may serve God in it.</P>
<P>IN the Year 1355, <HI>Thomas Hatfield,</HI> Bishop of <HI>Durham,</HI> confirmed to the Nuns of this House, the Abbess they had elected; her Name was <HI>Alice Davill.</HI> She had been not duly elected, and therefore he made the Election void; but however, as she was a Person the <HI>Convent</HI> very much approv'd of, the Bishop of his special Favour order'd her to preside over them.</P>
<P>THIS was granted at <HI>Aukland, May</HI> the 9th, in the Tenth Year of his Consecration.</P>
<P>DR. <HI>Hunter</HI> of <HI>Durham</HI> obliged me with the following Copy of the Bishop's Grant.</P>

<HEAD>Sect. IV. SCOTCH INN.</HEAD>
<P>OPPOSITE to this <HI>Nunnery,</HI> on the West-side of the Street, is an <HI>an∣cient Building</HI> with a large <HI>Gate,</HI> which has formerly been a Piece of stately Workmanship. <NOTE N="q" PLACE="marg">De rebus Novocast'.</NOTE> This Sir <HI>Robert Shaftoe,</HI> Recorder of this Town, was of Opinion, was the House of the Earls of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> and was cal∣led the <HI>Earls Inn.

<P>THIS Street from the <HI>Scotch Inn,</HI> or thereabouts, takes the Name of the <HI>Bigg</HI> and <HI>Oat-market;</HI> because in the Middle of it is kept a <HI>Market</HI> of <HI>Bigg</HI> and <HI>Oats</HI> every Tuesday and Saturday. Here the Street is broader than almost a∣ny Street in the whole Town, and adorn'd with good Houses: At the End of it Southward, is a very great <HI>Market</HI> for <HI>Poultry,</HI> which gives the Name of the <HI>Pullen-market</HI> to this Part of the Street.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VI.</HI> Of the Division of this Street.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">H</SEG>AVING now got as far as the End of the broad Part of this Street, we have the Breadth of it divided into <HI>Three Streets.</HI> The first <HI>Street,</HI> or that on the Right Hand, is called the <HI>Meal-market,</HI> the <HI>Oatmeal-market,</HI> or <HI>Groat-mar∣ket,</HI> because of the <HI>Oatmeal,</HI> which is sold there every Day of the Week, but more especially on the <HI>Saturday</HI>'s. What Name it had formerly, or whether it ever had any other, I cannot say; but this is certain, that it has re∣tained it's present Name above <HI>two hundred Years.</HI></P>
<P>AT the Upper-end of this Street, or the North-end of it, is the <HI>Post-house</HI> of this Town, which is adorned with a pretty <HI>Area</HI> of a <HI>Quadrangular Figure,</HI> together with a good Garden: It belongs to Mr. <HI>James Bell,</HI> the present Post-Master.</P>
<P>AS you descend from this End of the Street, you turn the Corner of this House upon the Right Hand, into a Lane called the <HI>Pudding-chare,</HI> or as I have seen it in some ancient Writings <HI>Budding-chare,</HI> which leads into <HI>West∣gate.</HI> There were three Houses in this Lane which paid an Annual Rent to the Chantry of the <HI>Holy Trinity</HI> in St. <HI>John</HI>'s Church; one paid 20 <HI>d. per Ann.</HI> another 2 <HI>d.</HI> and the third 4 <HI>d.</HI> The Lane called <HI>Rosemary-lane,</HI> which turns upon the Right Hand as you go down this Chare into <HI>Westgate,</HI> was former∣ly called St. <HI>John</HI>'s <HI>Chare;</HI> because it led from the <HI>Pudding-chare</HI> to St. <HI>John</HI>'s Church.</P>
<P>IN this Lane there is a <HI>Waste,</HI> which belong'd to the Nuns of St. <HI>Bartholo∣mew,</HI> boundering on the West on the Common Gutter, and on the North on the Chantery Lands.</P>
<P>THIS Waste is the Ground where are now the Gardens of Mr. <HI>James Bell,</HI> Post-master, and the old Houses on the North of these Gardens, now the Property of Mr. <HI>Ralph Trotter,</HI> are the <HI>Chantery Lands</HI> here mentioned.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="64"/>OVER against the South-end of this Lane, which so leads to St. <HI>John</HI>'s Church, is an ancient Alms-house, in which live seven poor People, who have a small Allowance at Christmas from the Town.</P>
<P>HAVING past the East-end of the <HI>Pudding-chare,</HI> we go Southward, which leads into the Body of the <HI>Meal-market,</HI> aforesaid.</P>
<P>THERE is little in this Street worth taking Notice of; the Houses ge∣nerally are very ancient and mean, the few good ones are one which was built the last Year by Mr. <HI>Prior</HI> of this Town, Cooper, an ancient Inhabitant in this Street; and another the House below it, which belongs to Mr. <HI>William Harrison,</HI> Dyer, which was formerly the Dwelling-house of <HI>Timothy Robson,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> Alderman of this Town, and sometime Mayor; and some few others.</P>
<P>IN the Reign of Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> a House in this Street belonging to one <HI>William Penrith,</HI> whose Site is now lost, paid an annual Rent to the Chante∣ry of our Lady in the Parish Church of <HI>Long-benton.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Rom. Bri∣tann. p. 132.</NOTE>THE late Mr. <HI>Horsely</HI> tells us of another House in this Street, in the laying of the Foundation of which, about 15 or 16 Years since, the Masons struck upon the Roman Wall at each of the Side Walls, so that the Building stands cross the Roman Wall. But where the Site of it is he does not say.</P>
<P>TOWARDS the lower end of this Street is a large open, where is a <HI>Mar∣ket</HI> every Saturday for <HI>Wool,</HI> below this again a Lane leading into <HI>Westgate,</HI> called <HI>Denton-chare.</HI></P>
<P>PASSING by the East-end of this Chare, we come to the ancient <HI>Iron-Mar∣ket,</HI> which was opposite to St. <HI>Nicholas Church,</HI> in that Piece of Ground lead∣ing to the Side, from the House of Mr. <HI>Charles Clark,</HI> and from below the Shop of the late Mr. <HI>John Kellot,</HI> Smith.</P>
<P>ANOTHER Street which the broad Street of the <HI>Big-market</HI> is divided in∣to is the <HI>Middle-street,</HI> so called because it stands in the Middle of the Streets in this Part of the Town; for it has on the East-side of it the <HI>Flesh-market</HI> and <HI>Pilgrim-street,</HI> and on the West, the <HI>Oatmeal-Market,</HI> and <HI>Westgate.</HI></P>
<P>THIS Street bore anciently three Names, the upper Part of it was called <HI>Skinner-gate,</HI> the lower Part of it <HI>Spurrier-gate</HI> and <HI>Sadler-gate.</HI></P>
<P>IT is a Street as it was in <HI>Grey</HI>'s Time, where all Sorts of Artificers have Shops and Houses.</P>
<P>WE come now to the 3d Street, <HI>(viz.)</HI> the <HI>Flesh-market,</HI> at the upper-end of which is the <HI>Upper-dean-bridge,</HI> so called because of the two Bridges which cross this Dean or Rivulet, which runs into <HI>Lorkburne,</HI> this is that which is the higher or upper one.</P>
<P>HAVING passed by the West-end of this Bridge we go Southward into the <HI>Flesh-market.</HI></P>
<P><HI>GREY</HI> tells us, <Q>that when the Good-men of this Town began to trade and venture beyond the Seas, they built many Ships, and procured a Char∣ter from the Kings of <HI>England</HI> to carry Fells beyond Seas, and to bring in foreign Commodities. The Staple was then at <HI>Antwerp</HI> in <HI>Brabant,</HI> called <HI>Commune totius Europae Emporium.</HI> The <HI>Charter</HI> of the <HI>Merchant Adventurers</HI> was the first Charter that was granted by any King to any Town.</Q></P>
<P><Q>AFTER this Grant this Town flourished in trading, built many fair Houses in the <HI>Flesh-market,</HI> then called <HI>Cloth-market.</HI> The Merchants had
<PB N="54" REF="65"/>
their Shops and Ware-houses there, in the Back-parts of their Houses: The River of <HI>Tyne</HI> flowed and ebbed, where Boats came up with Commodities; which Trade of Merchandizes continued many Years.</Q></P>
<P><Q>IN this Street the Mayors, Aldermen, and richest Men of the Town lived.</Q></P>
<P>PART of the present <HI>Flesh-market</HI> was called the <HI>Cloth-market,</HI> and part of it the <HI>Flesh-market</HI> and <HI>Fish-market.</HI> An Anonymous Authority says, that in <HI>Pil∣grim-street</HI> was the Market for <HI>Fish,</HI> that came up to the <HI>Nether-dean-bridge.</HI> But this in my Opinion is a Mistake. For in the Ward belonging to <HI>Mor∣den-Tower,</HI> part of it is over the <HI>Flesh-shambles</HI> from the North West Church Stile of St. <HI>Nicholas,</HI> unto the <HI>Fish-shambles.</HI> Consequently the <HI>Fish</HI> that came up to the <HI>Nether-dean-bridge</HI> must have been sold in the <HI>Flesh-market,</HI> not in <HI>Pilgrim-street.</HI> The Shops of this Street are at present the Shops of Artificers, and the Houses either chiefly Coffee-houses or Taverns, or Ale-houses.</P>
<P>IN some ancient Writings belonging to that worthy Gentleman <HI>The Rev. Mr.</HI> Smith <HI>of</HI> Melsonby, I find that several Houses in this Street paid an an∣nual Rent to <HI>University College</HI> in <HI>Oxford;</HI> one of them in particular nigh the Church Yard paid 6 <HI>s.</HI> in the Year 1304, and so did many Houses in the o∣ther Streets of this Town to the same <HI>College.</HI> Several of these were the Gift of the Lady <HI>Ann Bellasys</HI> to this College, <HI>An.</HI> 1444.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Flesh-market</HI> in this Street, which is held every Saturday, is a very great Market, not only as it supplies the Town in a great Measure, but as it also furnishes the Country for several Miles round. Besides there are several Thousands of People belonging to the <HI>Coal-Works,</HI> such as <HI>Staith-Men, Wag∣goners, Pit-Men, Wrights, Keel-Men,</HI> &amp;c. all which for the most part have their Provisions from this Market.</P>
<P>THE Provision also for <HI>Ships,</HI> is got from this Market. And this indeed must be very considerable, when there will be sometimes 3 or 4 hundred Sail in at a Time.</P>
<P>THERE are 2 <HI>Fairs</HI> kept in this Market every Year for 8 Days together, the one begins upon <HI>Lammas</HI> Day, or the First of <HI>August,</HI> which <HI>Grey</HI> calls <HI>a remarkable Time of the Year,</HI> but why he calls it so, he gives no Account. This Fair is in some Measure of an ancient standing. For we meet with some Account of it in the Reign of King <HI>John,</HI> mentioned in a Charter of another of our Kings. The Words are these, <HI>Insuper cum Dicti Burgenses per Chartam praefati Joannis Regis habeant in dicto Burgo unam feriam singulis annis per duos dies duraturam,</HI> viz. <HI>in vigilia &amp; in die Sancti Petri ad Vincula, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>NOW from this it appears that King <HI>John</HI> granted to the Town of <HI>New∣castle, Lammas</HI> Fair, which he order'd should be held on the Eve of St. <HI>Peter ad Vincula,</HI> and upon the Day it self. <NOTE N="r" PLACE="marg">Blount in Verb.</NOTE> I suppose <HI>Grey</HI> calls it a remark∣able Time of the Year, as well because it is called <HI>Lammas</HI> Day as because it is called St. <HI>Peter advincula.</HI> As it is <HI>Lammas</HI> Day, it is a remarkable Time of the Year, for it is called <HI>Lambmas</HI> because <HI>Lambs</HI> were not then fit to eat, they were grown too big: <HI>aliter</HI> from the <HI>Sax.</HI> III <HI>asmaesse <HI>q. d. Loaf∣mas,</HI></HI> because on that Day the English made an Offering of Bread made with <HI>new Wheat.</HI> On this Day it was, that Tenants that held Lands of the Cathe∣dral Church of <HI>York</HI> (which is dedicated to St. <HI>Peter ad Vincula</HI>) were bound by their Tenure to bring a <HI>Live Lamb</HI> into the Church at <HI>High-mass</HI> on that Day.</P>
<P>IT is also a remarkable Time, as it is St. <HI>Peter ad vincula,</HI> and as it is called the <HI>Gule</HI> of <HI>August,</HI> from the Latin <HI>Gula,</HI> a Throat. The Reason is set down in <HI>Durand</HI>'s <HI>Rationale</HI> (<HI>Lib.</HI> 7. <HI>c.</HI> 19.) who says, that one <HI>Quirinus,</HI> a <HI>Tribune,</HI> hav∣ing a Daughter that had a Disease in her Throat, went to <HI>Alexander,</HI> then Pope
<PB N="55" REF="66"/>
of <HI>Rome,</HI> the 6th from St. <HI>Peter,</HI> and desired of him to borrow, or to see the <HI>Chains,</HI> that St. <HI>Peter</HI> was chained with under <HI>Nero;</HI> which being obtained, the said Daughter kissing the Chains, was cured of her Desease, and <HI>Quirinus</HI> with his Family baptized. <HI>Tunc dictus</HI> Alexander <HI>Papa hoc Festum in Calendis augusti celebrandum instituit, &amp; in honorem beati</HI> Petri <HI>Ecclesiam in Urbe Fabrica∣vit, ubi vincula ipsa reposuit, &amp; ad Vincula nominavit, &amp; in calendis augusti dedi∣cavit. In qua, Festivitate Populus illic ipsa vincula hodie Osculatur.</HI> So that this Day being before called only the Calends of <HI>August,</HI> was upon this Occasion termed indifferently either St. <HI>Peter</HI>'s Day <HI>ad Vincula,</HI> from the Instrument that wrought the Miracle; or the Gule of <HI>August</HI> from that Part of the Virgin whereon the Miracle was wrought. <HI>Blount in verb.</HI></P>
<P>AFTER this Fair granted by King <HI>John,</HI> it was by a succeeding King, or∣dered to begin at the same Time, and to continue 28 Days. When it was reduced to the Time above-mentioned I have not met with.</P>
<P>THE other Fair held in this Market is at St. <HI>Lukesmas,</HI> it was granted to the Town in the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the 7th. During the Time of these Fairs there is a Court of <HI>Pye-powder.</HI> All the Privileges and Power that a Court Leet can have, is granted to this Court. <HI>Grey</HI> 17.</P>
<P>TOWARDS the South-end of this was a large <HI>Cross,</HI> with a lead Cistern at the Top of it to hold the Water, called the <HI>New-water;</HI> which was pulled down about 3 Years ago. Beyond this, at the End of this Street is the <HI>Cor∣diners Meeting-house.</HI></P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>T the End of the <HI>Flesh-market,</HI> on the South-side of the <HI>Cordiners</HI> Meeting-house, just now mentioned, stands the Church of St. <HI>Nicholas.</HI> It is a very grand and magnifi∣cent Building, being in length 79 Yards, two Foot, three Quarters; in breadth 24 Yards, two Foot, three Quarters; and of an Height equal and proportionable. Who it was founded by I have no where met with, but if a Conjecture may be made, it was perhaps founded by <HI>Henry</HI> the First: But be this as it will, it is certain it is as old as his Days. For <NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg"><P><HI>Henricus</HI> Rex, Angliae Archiepisco∣po <HI>Ebor'</HI> &amp; E∣piscopo <HI>Du∣nelm'</HI> &amp; Vi∣cecomiti de <HI>Northumber∣landa</HI> Salu∣tem.

<P>IN a Book belonging to the Vestry of St. <HI>Nicholas,</HI> it is said to be founded in the Year 1091; but what Authority this Account depends upon, I know not; however it is somewhat probable.</P>
<P>THE ordering of the <HI>Vicarage</HI> was not 'till some Years after. The King indeed in his Charter makes a general Provision of what is necessary for the <HI>Minister</HI> of this Church, but does not say what that is. This was done by <HI>Hugh Pudsey,</HI> Bishop of <HI>Durham,</HI> as <HI>Thomas Hatfield,</HI> one of his Successors gave it under his Episcopal Seal at <HI>Auckland, June</HI> 6th, 1360. For having searched the Register of <HI>Hugh,</HI> his Predecessor, he found, that he with the Con∣sent of the <HI>Prior,</HI> and Convent of <HI>Carlisle,</HI> order'd the <HI>Vicarage</HI> of St. <HI>Nicholas</HI> in <HI>Newcastle</HI> upon <HI>Tyne,</HI> on the Day before the Conversion of St. <HI>Paul,</HI> or <HI>January</HI> 24th, 1194, and gave the <HI>Vicar,</HI> for the Time being, a Portion, or Maintenance, <HI>viz.</HI> all the <HI>Fruits, annual Profits, Oblations, Obventions</HI> whatso∣ever, of what Kind or Thing soever they were, belonging to the Church of St. <HI>Nicholas,</HI> except the great Tythes belonging to the same Church.</P>

<P>THE <HI>Steeple</HI> of this Church is in Height 64 Yards, one Foot, three Quar∣ters. It is supposed, as to it's Model, to be the most curious in the whole Kingdom: It is adorned with 13 <HI>Pinacles,</HI> and a large and beautiful <HI>Lanthorn,</HI> which stands upon two very bold Arches of Stone, and at the Top of the said <HI>Lanthorn</HI> stands the tall <HI>Spire,</HI> by much the largest belonging to the <HI>Stee∣ple.</HI> On the Corners of the old <HI>Tower,</HI> upon which stands the said beautiful Structure, are four <HI>Images,</HI> one at each Corner, cut at length in Stone. 'Tis said that <HI>Ben Johnson,</HI> the Poet, made the following Lines upon it.</P>
<Q><L>My <NOTE N="t" PLACE="marg">Ex Grey.</NOTE> Altitude High, my Body, four Square,</L>

<L>I can direct you where the Wind doth stay,</L>
<L>And I tune God's Precepts twice a-Day.</L>
<L>I am seen where I am not, I am heard where I is not,</L>
<L>Tell me now what I am, and see that you miss not.</L></Q>
<P>IT is said, and indeed confessed, that <HI>Robert Rhodes</HI> was more probably the Builder of this <HI>Steeple</HI> than any other Person: His Name being at the Bottom of the <HI>Belsry.</HI></P>
<Q>Orate pro anima <HI>Roberti Rhodes.</HI></Q>
<P>BUT who this <HI>Robert Rhodes</HI> was, is more uncertain. <HI>Grey</HI> tells us, that <HI>Ro∣bert de Rhodes</HI> was the Lord Prior of <HI>Tinmouth,</HI> in <HI>Henry</HI> the 6th Days. And an <HI>Anoymous Authority</HI> seems to suggest, that this <HI>Robert Rhodes</HI> was one of the Bishop of <HI>Durham</HI>'s Justices; because in a Register at <HI>Durham,</HI> there is mention made of <HI>Robert Rhodes, ab Anno</HI> 1486, <HI>ad An'</HI> 1537, and <HI>Agnes</HI> his Wife.</P>
<P>BUT neither of these seem to me to be the true one. I am rather inclina∣ble to believe, that one <HI>Robert Rhodes,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> who lived in this Town in the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the 6th was the true Person. We meet with this Gentleman's Name in an Inquisition that was taken at the Castle of <HI>Newcastle,</HI> in the 25th of <HI>Henry</HI> the 6th, 1447; for two of the Gentlemen present were <HI>Roger Thorn∣ton,</HI> the Son of the famous Benefactor of that Name, and <HI>Robert Rhodes,</HI> and they were also first mentioned after the Mayor.</P>
<P><NOTE N="u" PLACE="marg">Lib. de Reb. 11.</NOTE>IN the Year 1451, we meet again with the same Person, who together with the said <HI>Roger Thornton,</HI> by an Instrument bearing the same Date, con∣veyed some Houses for the Use of a <HI>Chantery Priest</HI> to pray for the Soul of
<PB N="58" REF="69"/>
<HI>William Johnson.</HI> We have also a further Account of this Gentleman in the Year 1500, for an Instrument bearing that Date informs us, that the <HI>Mayor</HI> and Inhabitants of <HI>Newcastle,</HI> gave a Tenement to a Priest to live in, who was to pray for the Soul of <HI>Robert Rhodes</HI> and <HI>Agnes</HI> his Wife, at the Altar of St. <HI>John</HI> the Baptist, and <HI>John</HI> the Evangelist in St. <HI>Nicholas</HI> Church.</P>
<P>NOW when it is considered that this <HI>Robert Rhodes,</HI> I am speaking of, was so great a Man in this Town, that he lived in the same Reign in which <HI>Grey</HI> acknowledges the <HI>Lanthorne</HI> to have been built, namely in the Reign of <HI>Hen.</HI> the 6th, and that he was so commemorated by the <HI>Mayor</HI> and Inhabitants af∣ter his Decease, I dare say it will appear much more probable that he was the Builder than either of the others.</P>
<P>THERE might indeed be, and probably there was a <HI>Robert Rhodes,</HI> Prior of <HI>Tinmouth,</HI> in the Reign of <HI>Hen.</HI> the 6th, but I never met with any Bene∣factions of the Priors of <HI>Tinmouth</HI> to the Town of <HI>Newcastle.</HI> They were on the contrary mortal Enemies to this Place, and always jealous of it's encreas∣ing Glory. As to the other <HI>Robert Rhodes,</HI> one of the <HI>Bishop</HI>'s <HI>Justices,</HI> he was alive in the Year 1537, which was the 29th of <HI>Henry</HI> the 8th, and so comes too late to build a Steeple in the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the 6th. I have been told by a worthy Gentleman, and one who is curious in these Things, that this <HI>Robert Rhodes,</HI> so taken Notice of by this Town, was <HI>Escheator.</HI></P>
<P>THERE is a traditional Story of this Building I am now treating of, which may not be improper to be here taken Notice of. In the Time of the Civil Wars, when the <HI>Scots</HI> had besieg'd the Town for several Weeks, and were still as far as at first from taking it, the General sent a Messenger to the May∣or or of the Town, and demanded the Keys, and the Delivering up of the Town, or he would immediately demolish the <HI>Steeple</HI> of St. <HI>Nicholas.</HI> The Mayor and Aldermen upon hearing this, immediately ordered a certain Number of the chiefest of the Scottish Prisoners to be carried up to the Top of the old <HI>Tower,</HI> the Place below the <HI>Lanthorne,</HI> and there confined; after this they returned the <HI>General</HI> an Answer to this Purpose, That they would upon no Terms de∣liver up the Town, but would to the last Moment defend it: That the <HI>Steeple</HI> of St. <HI>Nicholas</HI> was indeed a beautiful and magnificent Piece of Architecture, and one of the great Ornaments of their Town; but yet should be blown into Attoms before ransom'd at such a Rate: That however, if it was to fall, it should not fall alone; that the same Moment he destroyed the beautiful Structure, he should Bath his Hands in the Blood of his Countrymen; who were placed there on Purpose either to preserve it from Ruin, or to die along with it. This Message had the desired Effect. The Men were there kept Prisoners during the whole Time of the Siege, and not so much as one Gun fired against it.</P>
<P>THERE were only five Bells originally belonging to this Church, but of late Years the Number is encreas'd to Eight. The great Bell, call'd the com∣mon Bell, was sent to <HI>Colchester</HI> to be new cast in the Year 1615, it weighed 3129 lb. They are very large ones, have a bold and noble Sound, and yet exceedingly sweet and Harmonious. The three latter Bells were given to this Church by the <HI>Corporation.</HI></P>
<P>IN the Year 1723, <HI>William Ellison,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> Mayor, and <HI>Robert Sowersby,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> Sheriff, the <HI>Steeple</HI> was repaired at the Expence of the <HI>Corporation.</HI></P>
<P>AT the North Door of this Church, it is observable, that the <HI>large Flagg</HI> which is the first Step into the Church, is cut all along the Surface with <HI>un∣even Lines,</HI> in Imitation of the Waves of the Sea. This is a silent Remem∣brancer of the <HI>Saint</HI> the Church is dedicated to; for St. <HI>Nicholas,</HI> the Bishop of <HI>Myra,</HI> who lived in the Time of <HI>Constantine</HI> the Great, is so famous among some for his Miracles and Apparitions by Sea, that he has merited the Title of the <HI>Patron of the Sailors.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="70"/>THERE were no fewer than 9 <HI>Chanteries</HI> belonging to this Church, which are valued at 48 <HI>l.</HI> 4 <HI>s.</HI> 6 <HI>d. per Annum.</HI></P>
<P>THE Chantery of St. <HI>John</HI> the Baptist, and St. <HI>John</HI> the Apostle, was on the <NOTE N="w" PLACE="marg">In Eccle∣sia Sancti <HI>Nich.</HI> de di∣cta villa No∣vicastri ad altare Bore∣ale Joannis Baptistae &amp; Joannis A∣post. &amp; E∣vangel. lib. Cart. p. 121.</NOTE> North-side of the Church. It is said to have been founded by <HI>Robert Rhodes</HI> and <HI>Agnes</HI> his Wife, and licensed by King <HI>Henry</HI> the 6th. If there be any Truth in this, it is that he was a third Founder. He allowed a Priest 7 <HI>l.</HI> 7 <HI>s.</HI> 10 <HI>d. per Annum</HI> to pray for his Soul, and the Soul of his Wife; and the Town of <HI>Newcastle,</HI> as it is said above, out of Respect to his Memory, gave the Priest a House to live in; but it's a Mistake that this <HI>Chantery</HI> was not founded before, for <HI>Richard de Emeldon</HI> who had been above 12 Times Mayor of <HI>Newcastle,</HI> was permitted by Letters Patents from King <HI>Edward</HI> the 3d, to build upon a Piece of vacant Ground, over against the Chapel of St. <HI>Thomas</HI> the Martyr, that he might present it to <HI>Three Chaplains,</HI> to procure their Prayers for him whilst he was living, and after he was dead, and also for the Souls of his Wives and his Father and Mother, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> every Day at the Al∣tar in St. <HI>Nicholas,</HI> which was dedicated to <HI>John</HI> the Baptist, and <HI>John</HI> the Apostle and Evangelist. This Gentleman died about the 6th or 7th of the Reign now mentioned, as is clearly gathered from the Authority above; and the Letters in which this Chantery is mentioned bear Date the 6th of this Reign: and therefore it is a Mistake to suppose this Chantery founded in the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the 6th, which was almost an hundred Years after.</P>
<P>THE Priests set a-part to attend this Altar, were every Day to pray for his Soul, and the others above-mentioned; and by an Order from the Then <HI>Ri∣chard,</HI> Lord Bishop of <HI>Durham,</HI> the Chaplains for the Time being, were obli∣ged on the <HI>Anniversary Day</HI> of his Death, every Year for Ever, to celebrate his Memory with a <HI>Solemn tolling of the Bells,</HI> and <HI>devoutly singing by Note</HI> in the <HI>Evening of the Anniversary,</HI> and on the <HI>Anniversary itself,</HI> and solemnly to sing Mass for the Soul of <HI>Richard</HI> himself, and the Souls above-mentioned, and the Souls of all the Faithful departed. And after Mass, one of the Chaplains was to distribute among <HI>an hundred and sixty poor People,</HI> the Sum of Six Shillings and Eight-pence, and this annually for ever. This, together with several o∣ther Things, was ordered by <HI>Richard,</HI> Bishop of <HI>Durham,</HI> in the 3d Year of his Consecration, <HI>Anno</HI> 1335, which was, with all other Things mentioned in the Charter, confirmed by <HI>Edward</HI> the 3d, in the 10th Year of his Reign.</P>
<P>THUS then it appears that this Chantery is of a much older Date than the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the Sixth. But this is not all; <HI>Richard de Emeldon,</HI> was but a second Founder of this Chantery: It boasts still an higher Antiquity, and is said to have been founded by <HI>Laurence</HI> of <HI>Durham,</HI> who was Prior of <HI>Durham</HI> in the Year 1149, which, by the way, is a further Proof of our Conjecture of this Church's being founded by King <HI>Henry</HI> the First, or in that Reign at latest.</P>
<P N="2">2. THE Chantery of St. <HI>Catherine</HI> was founded by <HI>William Johnson</HI> and <HI>I∣sabel</HI> his Wife, in the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the Third; it's yearly Value was 6 <HI>l.</HI> 15 <HI>s. Roger Thornton,</HI> the Son of <HI>Roger</HI> the great Benefactor, in a Deed dated <HI>December</HI> the 20th, 1451, is made, together with some others, a Trustee by a Feoffment of <HI>Roger booth,</HI> the surviving Feoffee of <HI>William Johnson,</HI> who gave the Lands and Tenements therein mentioned, for the better Support of a <HI>Perpetual Chaplain</HI> to attend the Chantery of St. <HI>Catherine,</HI> which is said to be <HI>ab Alano-Durham ab antiquo sundat:</HI></P>
<P>IN the Reign of King <HI>Henry</HI> the 6th, one <HI>Robert Mitford</HI> was the Chap∣lain of this Chantery, who succeeded <HI>Peter Angram,</HI> a former Chaplain.</P>
<P N="3">3. ANOTHER Chantery of St. <HI>Catherine,</HI> was founded by <HI>Nicholas</HI> and <HI>John Elliker.</HI> The Deed of Foundation is said to have been imbezeled by <HI>Richard Wallas,</HI> late Incumbent there: The yearly Value 3 <HI>l.</HI> 14 <HI>s.</HI> 8 <HI>d.</HI> which arose

out of certain Tenements situated in the <HI>Close, Castle-mote,</HI> in the <HI>Side,</HI> and in <HI>Sandgate.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. THE Chantery of St. <HI>Peter</HI> and St. <HI>Paul,</HI> was founded by <HI>Adam Henro∣ther,</HI> and <HI>Allan Hilton,</HI> and licenced by King <HI>Henry</HI> the Fourth; the yearly Value 4 <HI>l.</HI> 13 <HI>s.</HI> 4 <HI>d.</HI> which arose from some Tenements in the <HI>Close, Side,</HI> and <HI>Westgate.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. THE Chantery of St. <HI>Thomas,</HI> was founded by <HI>John Thapecape,</HI> and li∣cenced by <HI>Edward</HI> the Third; the yearly Value of it was 4 <HI>l.</HI> 12 <HI>s.</HI> 6 <HI>d.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. THE Chantery of our Lady, whose Deed of Foundation is said to have been imbezeled by <HI>Thomas Ireland,</HI> late Incumbent there. But however we may give some Guess at the Time of it: For <NOTE N="x" PLACE="marg">Lib. Cart. p. 48.</NOTE> there is mention made of it, and of two Shillings a Year given to it, in a Charter which was signed by <HI>Nicholas de Carleol,</HI> then Capital Bailiff of the Town, in the Year 1328; and in the Year 1305, <HI>Peter Graper,</HI> then Mayor of the Town, gave <NOTE N="y" PLACE="marg">Et cuidam Capellano celebranti divina ad al∣tare Beatae Mariae Virgi∣nis in Eccle∣sia Beatae Nicholai de Novo Ca∣stro duos So∣lidos argenti &amp;c.

That large <HI>Porch</HI> on the South-side of the Church, or the South-Cross of the Church, as it is called, is the Chantery of St. <HI>Mary</HI>'s; the yearly Value of it was 5 <HI>l.</HI> 16 <HI>s.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. <HI>STEPHEN Whitgray,</HI> and <HI>Mary</HI> his Wife, founded the Chantery of St. <HI>Margaret,</HI> in the South-side of the Church of St. <HI>Nicholas,</HI> in the Reign of <HI>Richard</HI> the Second. I take that Square Place, called <HI>Bewick</HI>'s Burial-place, now the Burial-place of <HI>Utrick Whitfield,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> near the Porch-Door of this Church, to have been this Chantery.</P>
<P>THEY constituted <HI>John de Etell,</HI> Chaplain of this Chantery, to pray for their Souls, and the Souls of the faithful departed. The Value of this Chan∣tery was 10 Marks yearly, which was raised out of certain Tenements, <HI>viz.</HI> out of one near the <HI>Cale-cross,</HI> and from a Tenement which paid somewhat to the <HI>Chantery</HI> of St. <HI>Eligie,</HI> in the Church of <HI>All-Hallows</HI> in this Town; and from another Tenement near the <HI>Cale-Cross,</HI> which lay near <HI>Grundon-chare;</HI> and from another Tenement over-against St. <HI>Nicholas</HI> Church; and from ano∣ther Tenement in <HI>Hackergate,</HI> near the Chapel of <HI>All-Saints;</HI> and from a Te∣nement near <HI>Kirk-chare;</HI> from a Tenement in <HI>Pampedon;</HI> from a Tenement in <HI>Broad-chare;</HI> from a Garden near <HI>Pampedon-burne;</HI> from a Tenement in <HI>Cale∣garth</HI> in <HI>Broad-chare,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>THE Chaplain of this Chantery, after the Decease of the Founder, was to be chosen by the <HI>Vicar</HI> of St. <HI>Nicholas,</HI> the <HI>Mayor</HI> and <HI>Bailiffs</HI> of this Town, and Four of the honest Parishioners of St. <HI>Nicholas.</HI> Witnesses of this Char∣ter, were <HI>Laurentius de Acton,</HI> Mayor of this Town, <HI>Henry de Carliol, Thomas de Gryndon, John de Newbiggyng, John de Appreton,</HI> Bailiffs, <HI>Thomas de Hering∣ton, John de Coket.</HI> Given at <HI>Newcastle</HI> the 20th of <HI>April, Anno Dom.</HI> 1394, in the 17th of <HI>Richard</HI> the Second.</P>
<P N="8">8. THE Chantery of St. <HI>Cuthbert,</HI> was founded by <HI>Thomas Harrington</HI> and <HI>William Redmarshall,</HI> in the Reign of <HI>Richard</HI> the Second; yearly Value 7 <HI>l.</HI> 3 <HI>s.</HI> 2 <HI>d.</HI> which was raised out of certain Tenements situated in the <HI>Sandhill, Side,</HI> and <HI>Close.</HI></P>
<P N="9">9. THE Chantery of St. <HI>Loye,</HI> was founded by <HI>Robert Castell,</HI> in the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the Third: Yearly value 4 <HI>l.</HI> 10 <HI>s.</HI> which arose from Tenements in the <HI>Close, Westgate,</HI> and from a Close without the <HI>West-gate,</HI> called <HI>Goose-green-close.</HI></P>
<P>THE Font belonging to this Church has either been built or repair'd by <HI>Robert Rhodes</HI> the Builder of the upper Part of the Steeple; for his Coat of Arms (and probably his Wife's too) is quartered on the Basis of it.</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="72"/>ON the <HI>North-Isle,</HI> answering to the Nave or Body of this Church is a large Gallery, which is chiefly for the Use of the Boys of the Grammar School. At the East-end of which an Addition was made to it by the Rev. Dr. <HI>Tom∣linson,</HI> for the Use of his Successor, the Lecturer of St. <HI>Nicholas,</HI> and his own Family.</P>
<P>IN the <HI>Rood-loft,</HI> or the Gallery which seperates the Chancel from the Nave of the Church, now called the Organ-loft, is a <HI>Double Organ.</HI></P>
<P>ON the North-side of this Organ, is a Porch called <HI>Saint George</HI>'s <HI>Porch,</HI> which was built, as <HI>Grey</HI> informs us, by <HI>one of the Kings of this Land.</HI> It has undoubtedly been one of the ancient Chanteries; for several of them were si∣tuated thereabouts, between the Gallery and this Porch; as some others of them were in <HI>St. Mary</HI>'s <HI>Porch,</HI> or the South Cross of the Church. It hath under it a Vault, and there is on the North Windows the <HI>Head of the King,</HI> the Father of the Lady which <HI>St. George</HI> delivered from the <HI>Dragon.</HI></P>
<P>ON the East Windows is still remaining some of the painted Glass. There is particularly the Picture of <HI>Saint Laurence,</HI> and some <HI>Skin-marks,</HI> and <HI>Coats of Arms.</HI> It has been a beautiful little Place: It is ceiled at the Top, and has been surrounded with carv'd Work in Wood; some of which still remains, to speak the Curious Art and commendable Expence of the Days of old.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Chancel</HI> of this Church is a very noble and stately one. The Altar was in the Year 1712, very sumptuously and yet decently adorn'd. At the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/></NOTE> Top, is the Word <HI>Jehovah,</HI> and under that, in a Glory, a Part of the Name of Lord which he himself proclaimed before <HI>Moses. The Lord God merciful and gracious.</HI> What is below that again, see in the Altar of <HI>All-hallows.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The PLATE for the Altar.</HI></P>
<P>TWO Flaggons; Three Challices and Covers; Three Salvers; A small Spoon Drainer.</P>
<P>ON the <HI>South</HI> Side of the <HI>Chancel</HI> is the <HI>Vestry,</HI> above which is the <HI>Library.</HI> The Keeper of which is the Rev. Mr. <HI>Stoddard,</HI> Assistant Curate of this Church.</P>
<P>IN this are several good Books, and some <HI>Manuscripts:</HI> But it is not at pre∣sent any way comparable to what it will be hereafter, either for Variety or Number of Books of all Kinds of Learning; The worthy and learned Dr. <HI>Tomlinson,</HI> being expected to leave at his Death, to this Library, his whole Study, which is perhaps (considering the vast Number of Books, their be∣ing so well chosen, so neatly and curiously Bound, their great Variety, being of all Manner of Subjects, treating of all Arts and Sciences) a Library out∣done by few private Gentlemen in the Kingdom.</P>
<P><NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Grey 10.</NOTE>IN this Church are many sumptuous Windows, but that in the East sur∣passeth all the Rest in Height, Largeness, and Beauty. This Author says, that there were in this Window the Twelve <HI>Apostles,</HI> and the seven Deeds of <HI>Charity:</HI> I suppose he Means, painted upon the Glass. He tells us also, that this Window was built by the Beneficent <HI>Roger Thornton,</HI> the Elder, and that there was this Inscription on it. <HI>Orate pro anima</HI> Rogeri <HI>de</HI> Thornton, &amp; <HI>pro animabus Filiorum &amp; Filiarum.</HI> At present there is nothing remaining of these Pictures, but two Heads, which, if we may Judge of the Rest by them, will speak them to have been very Tall, and curiously done: The Inscription is intirely gone.</P>
<P>AN Indulgence of 40 Days was granted by twelve Foreign <HI>Bishops,</HI> 1359, and confirmed by <HI>Thomas Hatfield,</HI> Bishop of <HI>Durham,</HI> to all such (having re∣pented and confessed their Sins) as performed the following Things, <HI>viz.</HI> If

<P>ON the North-side of this South-Isle, at the South-end of the <HI>Organ Gal∣lery</HI> is the Monument of the Family of the <HI>Maddisons.</HI> It is very beautifull, sumptuous, and magnificent. The Statues are so devoutly postur'd on bended Knees, with uplifted Hands, that whilst we view them with our outward Eyes, we are inwardly struck with a Religious Awe, and secret Wishes after Piety and Devotion.</P>
<P>AT the Top of it, which is pretty high, are three Statues; that on the West in a sitting Posture, with a <HI>Cross</HI> in the left Hand, and a <HI>Book</HI> in the Right, is the Representation of <HI>Faith;</HI> that on the <HI>East</HI> in a sitting, expect∣ing Posture, with an <HI>Anchor</HI> at her Feet, is the Representation of <HI>Hope,</HI> and that in the <HI>standing Posture,</HI> with a <HI>Flaming Heart</HI> in her <HI>Hand,</HI> (the Emblems of Action, and Fervency and Love) is the Representation of <HI>Charity.</HI> Above the Statue on the East, is <HI>Memorare Novissima,</HI> and above that on the West, <HI>Memoriae sacrum.</HI></P>
<P>BELOW these <HI>three Statues,</HI> is the Body of the Monument, having in it 6 large and beautiful Statues, three Men and three Women, on their bended Knees, with folded Hands in the Posture of Prayer; who these are designed for may be easily learned from the Inscriptions below; the Lady of the <HI>West∣end,</HI> which has on the right Hand of her a Pillar of the <HI>Corinthian Order,</HI> is <HI>E∣lizabeth</HI> the Wife of <HI>Henry Maddisson;</HI> The Gentleman next to her is <HI>Henry</HI> her Husband; for he is cloathed in the <HI>Scarlet-Gown</HI> of the Aldermen of <HI>New∣castle,</HI> because he was sometime <HI>Mayor</HI> of this Town. Next to him is his Fa∣ther <HI>Lionel Maddison,</HI> cloathed in the same Manner (for he was <HI>thrice Mayor</HI> of this Town) kneeling before a <HI>Desk,</HI> with an <HI>open Book</HI> on it; on the o∣ther Side of this <HI>Desk</HI> is his Wife <HI>Jane,</HI> kneeling in the same Manner, with her face to him; next to her, is their Son <HI>John,</HI> who died in the Expediti∣on to <HI>Cadix,</HI> and who is therefore <HI>cloathed in Armour.</HI> Then we have the op∣posite Pillar of the <HI>Corinthian Order,</HI> on the other Side of which is the Effigies of one of <HI>Henry</HI>'s Daughters, probably <HI>Barbara,</HI> who dyed at the Age of 17 Years, as is said on an adjoining Stone.</P>

Here rests in Christian Hope the Bodies of <HI>Lionel Maddison,</HI> Son of <HI>Row∣land Maddison,</HI> of the County of <HI>Durham,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> and of <HI>Jane</HI> his Wife; she died <HI>July</HI> the 9th, 1611, he having been thrice Mayor of this Town, depar∣ted <HI>December</HI> 6th, 1624, aged 94 Years, he lived to see his only Son <HI>Henry</HI> Father to a fair and numerous Issue; here interr'd also are the Bodies of <HI>Hen∣ry Maddison,</HI> and <HI>Elizabeth</HI> his Wife, Daughter of <HI>Robert Barker</HI> of this Town, who lived together most comfortably 40 Years, he was sometime Mayor of this Town, and having lived in good Name and Fame 60 Years, deceased in the true Faith of Christ the 14th of <HI>July</HI> 1634. <HI>Elizabeth</HI> his only Wife, had Issue by him ten Sons, <HI>(viz.)

<P>IN this North Part of the Church of St. <HI>Nicholas</HI> was a Shrine of <HI>Henry</HI> Earl of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> who in the 4th of <HI>Henry</HI> the 7th was Lieutenant of <HI>Yorkshire,</HI> and being commanded by the King to levy those Monies which were then extorted from the Country to carry on the War of <HI>Britany;</HI> the Vulgar conceiving him to be the Cause of that Task, tumultuously murdered him at <HI>Cockledge,</HI> near <HI>Threske,</HI> eighteen Miles north of <HI>York,</HI> upon the Day of St. <HI>Vitalis</HI> the Martyr; whereupon he was buried at <HI>Beverley,</HI> where he hath a stately Monument, but much defaced. This is Shrine at present much more so, being no where to be met with; bul <HI>Grey</HI> tells us, that in this Part of the Church there was such a Monument in his Time, that was made in Memory of him in his own Country; he having a House in this Town and Parish, and that Part of the Inscription upon it was, <HI>Orate pro anima Hemici Percy</HI> 4 <HI>Northumbriae qui per Rebbelium Manus occabuit,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Milbank</HI> Manuscript says it was in the north Corner of the Church: That it was a Monument of Wood; on which was painted an <HI>old Man,</HI> our <HI>Saviour</HI> on his right Hand, and the <HI>Virgin Mary</HI> on his Left. There came a Labil from her Mouth, but what it was this Authority had forgot; but that from our <HI>Saviour</HI>'s was <HI>Quaeso Patri sac, qued rog it mea Mater.</HI></P>
<P>THEN followed some Latin Verses, done in the rhiming Way of the Monks, but they are so dark and obscure, that little can be made of them. the Manuscript goes on; When Mr. <HI>William Selby</HI> was buried, this Monu∣ment was removed out of that Corner, and Sir <HI>George Selby</HI> did set his mag∣nificent Tomb there. Alter that it was placed against the Wall, next to Sir <HI>George</HI>'s Tomb, and so continued 'till Mr. <HI>Lane. Hodshon</HI> got leave of Vicar <HI>Nailor</HI> to remove it and place his Father. Where it is now I know not.</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="84"/><HI>Grey</HI> tells us, that the <HI>Parson</HI> of the Town is the Bishop of <HI>Carlisle,</HI> who hath his <HI>Vicar</HI> or <HI>Substitute.</HI> How this Bishop came to have this Living in his Gift, I have shewed in the Beginning of our Account of this Church.</P>
<P>UPON this Church depend the other Churches; for the <HI>Vicar</HI> has Dues from them all: And yet they are each of them a distinct Parish from St. <HI>Ni∣cholas.</HI></P>
<P>THIS <HI>Vicarage</HI> is reckoned 150 <HI>l. per Ann.</HI> and the Corporation makes an annual Addition of 90 <HI>l. per Ann.</HI> to it, which was granted by this generous and worthy Body, that the Vicar might live in a more plentiful and hospitable Manner than he could otherwise do.

<P>DR. <HI>Jackson,</HI> Vicar, he left the Vicarage, and dyed in the South of <HI>England, Anno</HI> 1640, <HI>Eachard</HI> the Historian gives this Character of him.</P>
<P><Q>DR. <HI>Thomas Jackson,</HI> the Ornament of the University of <HI>Oxford,</HI> was President of <HI>Corpus Christi</HI> College, and Dean of <HI>Peterborough,</HI> he was a Man of great Piety and Worth, Industry and Ability, a great Master of the Fathers, and profoundly read in Theology, as appears from his many learned Treatises.</Q></P>
<P><HI>YEILDARD Alvey,</HI> Vicar, was buried at St. <HI>Nicholas,</HI> 1648, he succeeded in the Vicarage of <HI>Newcastle</HI> in the Year 1630, when the most learned Dr. <HI>Jackson</HI> was elected President of <HI>Corpus Christi</HI> College, in <HI>Oxford,</HI> his Suf∣ferings began very early in the Troubles,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vide Ann. 1645.</NOTE> as I find by a Letter of his, writ∣ten to his Grace the Archbishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> and dated from <HI>York, Oct.</HI> 16, 1640, wherein he sets forth what he then had suffer'd, in the following Manner. <HI>I am for the present outed of all my spiritual Promotions, to the yearly Value of</HI> 300 l. <HI>and have most of my moveable Goods seized upon by the Rebels, be∣ing forc'd (upon some threatning Speeches given out by them, that they would deal more rigourously with me than others) suddenly to desert all, and to provide for the Safety of my self, Wife, and seven Children, by a speedy Flight in the Night-time; how they would have dealt with me they have since made evident, by their harsh dealing with two of my Curates, whom I left to officiate for me in my Absence; who have not only been interrupted in reading Divine Service; but threatn'd to be Pistol'd, if they would not desist from the Execution of their Office: And whereas I had lately purchased</HI> 60 <HI>Pounds</HI> per Annum <HI>in</HI> Northumberland, <HI>and hoped to have been supplied that Way in these calamitous Times, 'till I might with Safety re∣turn; they have, since I presented my Petition to his Majesty, seized upon that also, and commanded my Servant to be accountable to them for it: This is my Case at this Time.</HI> Afterwards, as might be expected, it was far worse, for, as I am otherwise inform'd he was not only pull'd out of this Pulpit by two Holy Sisters, but imprison'd at <HI>Newcastle,</HI> at <HI>Holy-Island,</HI> and at <HI>Norwich;</HI> his Fa∣mily increas'd under his Troubles, if I mistake not, to ten Children, (for so many I find his Wife bore him in all) which were reduced to great Streights, and subsisted in good measure by Charity; I perceive by the Letter above∣mentioned, that he had been active as well as passive in the Service of his Ma∣jesty; by both which Means he had so far recommended himself to the Fa∣vour and Esteem of that Prince, that he had design'd some Reward for him, which in all Probability the Rebellion prevented the King from bestowing. Nor did Mr. <HI>Alvey</HI> live to receive it from his royal Son, on the Restoration, for his Death happened in the Year, 1648, and was hastened, as 'tis thought, by his Sufferings. He was a very Honest Good Man, and a true Son of the Church of <HI>England;</HI> as, I am told, appears by a little Tract which he wrote, and which I have not yet been able to get a Sight of, intitled, <HI>The Humble Confession and Vindication of them who suffer'd much, and still suffer, under the Name of Malignants and Delinquents,</HI> Publish'd in 1647.</P>
<P>DR. <HI>Robert Jenison,</HI> 1645, buried at St. <HI>Nicholas, November</HI> 8, 1652.</P>

The last Sermon he preached was in the Epistle to the <HI>Hebrews,</HI> 2d <HI>Chap. V</HI> 3d. <HI>How shall we escape if we neglect so great Salvation?</HI> He preached it on the Sun∣day Morning, and on the Sunday following was buried.</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="86"/>THIS Sermon, together with eleven more, were published and recommen∣ded to the World by Dr. <HI>Scot,</HI> the Author of the <HI>Christian Life.</HI> There were several other Sermons of his published in his Life-time, (viz.) one intitled <HI>The false Prophet unmask'd,</HI> or, <HI>The Wolf strip'd of his Sheep's Cloathing,</HI> preached on the 30th of <HI>January,</HI> 1683, before the Mayor and Aldermen of this Town, and dedicated to them, another on the 30th <HI>Jan.</HI> 1676/7, dedicated to the May∣or and Magistrates.

<P><HI>NATHANIEL Ellison,</HI> D. D. Vicar, died <HI>May</HI> 4th, 1721, and was buried at. St. <HI>Nicholas</HI>'s. He was born in this Town.

<P>IN the Year 1700, he Publish'd at <HI>London</HI> a Sermon preached before the Mayor and Magistrates of this Town at St. <HI>Nicholas</HI>'s Church, <HI>October</HI> 8th, 1699, being the Sunday after the Election of the Mayor. It was Entituled, <HI>The Magistrates Obligation to punish Vice.</HI></P>
<P>IN the Year 1701, his Sermon of <HI>Confirmation,</HI> preached <HI>June</HI> 23, 1700, before the Lord <HI>Crew,</HI> Bishop of <HI>Durham,</HI> at St. <HI>Nicholas</HI>'s Church in this Town, was printed at <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>IN the Year 1710 he printed his Sermon at <HI>London,</HI> which was preached at <HI>Ali-hallows</HI> Church, on <HI>All-Saints</HI> Day, 1709, at the Opening of a Charity-School in that Parish. It is Entitled, <HI>The Obligations and Opportunities of do∣ing Good to the Poor.</HI></P>

He was succeeded in the Vicarage by</P>
<P><HI>THOMAS Turnor,</HI> A. M. of St. <HI>John</HI>'s <HI>College,</HI> in <HI>Cambridge,</HI> the present Vicar.</P>

<P>HE was a Native of the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland;</HI> and was by the House of Commons (<HI>June</HI> 18th, 1642) resolved unfit to be Lecturer of St. <HI>Nicholas;</HI> and soon after, as I presume, turned out of that Place. He was plunder'd al∣so, and suffer'd a long and tedious Imprisonment, in the nastiest Part of the <HI>Tolbooth</HI> at <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> called the <HI>Thieves-hole.</HI> After his Sequestration, having returned into his own Country, he became Minister of the Church of St. <HI>An∣drew;</HI> at length accompanied the noble Marquiss of <HI>Montross</HI> in his Conquest of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and upon the Declension of that immortal Person, became <HI>Chap∣lain</HI> to the Queen of <HI>Bohemia.</HI> On the Restoration of his Majesty he return∣ed to his Lecture of <HI>Newcastle,</HI> where he continued in great Esteem and Ve∣neration for his unspotted <HI>Loyalty,</HI> until 1662, at which Time he was promo∣ted to the Bishoprick of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> where he dyed about the middle of the Year, 1671.

<P>DIRECTLY opposite to the East Window of St. <HI>Nicholas</HI> Church is the <HI>Nether-dean-bridge,</HI> which you descend into by some Stairs, that lead from the <HI>Church-yard.</HI></P>
<P>IT is called so, because it goes over the <HI>Dean</HI> or <HI>Syke</HI> lower down the Town than the other Bridge; for as the <HI>Higher-bridge</HI> has the Name of the <HI>Upper-dean-bridge,</HI> because it is higher in the Town, so this being lower in the Town, has the Name of the <HI>Nether-dean-bridge.</HI> It is a little narrow Lane which leads into <HI>Pilgrim-street.</HI> Formerly, when the Merchants had their Shops and Ware-houses in the <HI>Flesh-market,</HI> the River ebb'd and flow'd above this Bridge, and the Boats came under it with the Wares and Commodities of the Mer∣chants. But it is chiefly Famous because the <HI>Roman Wall</HI> went along it. It came from the Vicar's Garden, through the Body of St. <HI>Nicholas</HI> Church, then along this Street, and so on into <HI>Pandon.</HI></P>
<P>As you descend the Stairs afore-mention'd into this Lane, there is an <HI>Alms-house</HI> on the left Hand for two or three poor Women, but it has no Allow∣ance.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HIS Street got it's Name from the <HI>Pilgrims,</HI> who came from all parts of this Kingdom to worship at our <HI>Lady</HI>'s <HI>Chapel</HI> at <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg"><P><HI>Gesmond,</HI> or <HI>Jesu∣munde,</HI> or as it is called in some ancient Writings <HI>Je∣sumuth,</HI> is it pleasant Vil∣lage, on the North-East of <HI>Newca∣stle,</HI> Distant from it about <HI>2</HI> Miles; it appertained to the Barony of <HI>Robert de Gaugy,</HI> as appears by a Certificate given in the Third of <HI>Hen.</HI> the 3d. of such Manours, as his Barony did consist of, for which he was obliged to the Service of <HI>Three Knights Fees.</HI> Mag. Brit. Vol. <HI>3. Adamus de Athol,</HI> who lies buried in the Chapel of the <HI>Holy Trinity,</HI> in St.<HI>Andrew</HI>'s Church, lived in this Village, and is called <HI>Dominus de Jesmond:</HI> The <HI>Orde</HI>'s Family was also in Possession of it.</P>
<P>There are still to be seen the Ruins of the <HI>Chapel</HI> and <HI>Hospital</HI> of our <HI>Lady</HI> in this Village. The <HI>Hospital</HI> is now a Dwelling-house; but the Chapel is chang'd into something worse, being turn'd into a Stable.</P>
<P>I am told, and it is very probable, that this <HI>Chapel</HI> and <HI>Hospital</HI> are at present the Property of Mr. <HI>Robert Andrew</HI> of <HI>Gateshead.</HI></P></NOTE> <HI>Gesmond.</HI></P>
<P>THERE was an Inn in this Street, which the <HI>Pilgrims</HI> in their Journey were wont to call at, which occasioned their constant coming up this Street, and so it got it's Name of <HI>Pilgrim-street,</HI> as the <HI>Inn</HI> did that of the <HI>Pilgrims Inn.</HI> As you descend this Street, you have on the left Hand a Passage to the <HI>Carliol-croft,</HI> which is a large Field (formerly the Property of the <HI>Carliols,</HI> now of <HI>John Rogers,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR>) bounded on one Side with the Town's Walls, and on the other by the <HI>Gardens</HI> on this Side of <HI>Pilgrim-street.</HI></P>
<P>ON that Side of it, next the <HI>Town-Wall</HI> is a very agreeable Walk, gene∣rally frequented in a Summer's Evening by the <HI>Gentry</HI> of this Part of the Town; The Prospect of the Gardens, some of which are exceeding Curious, afford∣ing a good deal of Pleasure.</P>
<P>THERE is a Passage from this Field into the <HI>Manour-Chare.</HI></P>

<P><HI>To this Village it was that a great Number of the People of</HI> Newcastle, <HI>headed by some of the</HI> Aldermen, <HI>and principal Men of the Town, came to kill the</HI> Prior <HI>of</HI> Tinmouth, <HI>in the first of the Reign of King</HI> Henry <HI>the Eighth; as may be seen in that Year.</HI></P>
<P><HI>In the 3d of</HI> Edw. <HI>6th, the Town got a Grant of the</HI> Chapel <HI>of the Blessed</HI> Mary <HI>of</HI> Jesmond, <HI>and some Messuages and Lands in</HI> Jesmond; <HI>under an annual Rent of</HI> 3 s. 4 d. <HI>payable out of some Lands in old</HI> Heaton, <HI>and the</HI> Chapel <HI>or</HI> Chantery <HI>of St.</HI> Laurence, <HI>with the Messuages called St.</HI> Laurence <HI>and</HI> Little St. Anne's Close, <HI>and Lands in</HI> Byker, <HI>then in the Possession of</HI> Henry Winklive, <HI>and Lands in</HI> Killingworth, <HI>then in the Possession of</HI> John Humley, <HI>an annual Rent</HI> 4 s. <HI>payable oat of the Lands of the then</HI> Christopher Mitford, <HI>in</HI> Old-Heaton.</P>
<P><HI>These were granted in Consideration of</HI> 144 l. 13 s. 4 d.</P>
<P><HI>In the same Year the Mayor and Burgesses granted the Hospital of the Blessed</HI> Mary <HI>of</HI> Jesmond, <HI>with the Lands and Grounds belonging to it, to Sir</HI> John Brandling, <HI>his Heirs and Assigns for ever.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The Gentleman of this Place at present is</HI> William Coulson, <HI><ABBR>Esq</ABBR> who lately built a very pretty House, and accommodated it with Gardens.</HI></P>
<P><HI>St.</HI> Mary<HI>'s Well in this Village, which is said to have had as many Steps down to it, as there are</HI> Articles <HI>in the</HI> Creed, <HI>was lately inclos'd by Mr.</HI> Coulson <HI>for a Bathing-Place; which was no sooner done than the Water left it. This occasioned strange Whispers in the Village and the adjacent Place. The Well was always esteemed of more Sanctity than common Wells, and therefore the Failing of the Water could be looked upon its nothing less than a just Revenge for so great a Prophanation. But alas! the Miracle's at an End, for the Water returned a-while ago in as great Abundance as ever.</HI></P>

<P>ON the Right-hand, as you descend from this Gate of <HI>Pilgrim-street,</HI> is the <HI>High-Frier-Chare,</HI> which leads into <HI>Newgate-street.</HI> There was in this Lane a <HI>Fryery,</HI> which occasioned it's Name.</P>
<P>IT was situated somewhere about <HI>Ficket-Tower,</HI> which is the next round Tower to <HI>Pilgrim-gate.</HI></P>
<P>THIS appears from the Account of the Ward belonging to this Tower, a Part of which is as follows; <HI>It shall have to Ward,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>with all</HI> Grey-Fryer-Chare, <HI>from the</HI> Barras, <HI>opposite to the</HI> Ficket-Tower, <HI>and the North Kirk Door of the said Fryery, Westward, and no farther Eastward in that Lane.</HI></P>
<P><HI>GREY</HI> in this Part of the Town says, that in the Upper-part of this Street is a Princely House, built out of the Ruins of the Black-Fryers.</P>
<P>THIS is contrary to the Authority above, where it is called the <HI>Grey-Fryer-Chare.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="94"/>AND besides it is contrary to several ancient Writings, which call this Chare <HI>Vicus qui ducit ad Fratres minores,</HI> or the Chare of the <NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg"><HI>Vide</HI> Newgate.</NOTE> <HI>Grey-Fryers,</HI> so that it is as great a Mistake to place the <HI>Black-Fryers</HI> here, as to say the <HI>Grey-Fryers</HI> were placed in <HI>Westgate.</HI> Their Situation, according to the Authority above, must have been in the Garden of <HI>Walter Blacket,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> in that Part of it which is opposite to <HI>Ficket-Tower,</HI> and the rest of that Garden must have been the Garden and other Conveniencies of this Monastery. This House was founded by the Family of the <HI>Carliols,</HI> in the Reign of King <HI>Henry</HI> the 3d, for they were (as appears from ancient Writings) a Regular and well settled Body in the Year 1267.</P>
<P>THEY were originally Merchants of this Town, and afterwards landed Men.</P>
<P>TWO of this Family succeeded <HI>Peter Scott,</HI> (who was the First Mayor of <HI>Newcastle,</HI> and Mayor for three Years) from the Year 1254, to the Year 1269.</P>
<P>THIS Situation is also confirmed by the <HI>Milbank</HI> Manuscript which says, that this Fryery was near to <HI>Pilgrim-street-gate,</HI> and that there is a little Lane be∣tween it and the Walls, wherein there is an <HI>Alms-house;</HI> but now both the Fryery and it are converted to private Uses.</P>
<P>THIS <HI>Alms-house</HI> flourished as late as Queen <HI>Mary</HI>'s Days, for 'tis said in a Writing belonging to Mr. <HI>Richard Wall</HI> of this Town, the Proprietor of these Houses, that in the Year 1555/6, in the Reign of <HI>Philip</HI> and <HI>Mary</HI> it was inha∣bited by poor Religious Women; <HI>Inhabitant nunc</HI> — <HI>Pauperes mulieres Deo servientes.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>Grey-Fryers,</HI> or as they are properly called the <HI>Franciscans,</HI> received their Name from St. <HI>Francis,</HI> born in the Dutchy of <HI>Spoletum</HI> in <HI>Italy,</HI> who was canonized by Pope <HI>Gregory</HI> the <HI>Ninth;</HI> about two Years after whose Death the <HI>Franciscans</HI> came into <HI>England,</HI> and one <HI>Diggs,</HI> (Ancestor of Sir <HI>Dudley Diggs</HI>) bought for them their first Seat in <HI>Canterbury.</HI></P>
<P>THIS Order for School Divinity beat all other Orders, and had a Curious <HI>Library</HI> in <HI>London</HI> (built by <HI>Richard Whittington</HI>) in that Age, costing 550 <HI>l.</HI> They afforded in <HI>England</HI> 110 learned Writers. <HI>Fuller.</HI></P>
<P>WHILST this Order flourish'd in <HI>England,</HI> this <HI>Province</HI> was divided into 7 <HI>Pacts</HI> or <HI>Districts</HI> called <HI>Custodies,</HI> because each of them was governed by the <HI>Provincial,</HI> who had charge of them all, by a particular superior, called <HI>Custos,</HI> or <HI>Keeper,</HI> who had the Power over all the Convents within his <HI>District</HI> or <HI>Custody.</HI> The 7 <HI>Custodies</HI> are as follows, The Custody or Wardenship of <HI>London</HI> had nine <HI>Convents,</HI> That of <HI>York</HI> seven Monasteries, That of <HI>Cambridge</HI> seven Monasteries, That of <HI>Newcastle</HI> nine Monasteries (viz.)

<P><HI>JOHN Scotus</HI> alias <HI>Duns,</HI> or <HI>Duns Scotus;</HI> there was much Controversy whether he was an English-Man, a Scot, or an Irish-Man. He was a Man of a mean Fortune, of a Wit made for Learning, and wonderful Subtle and Sharp. When he had studied some Years with great Advantage at <HI>Oxford,</HI> he returned into <HI>Northumberland,</HI> his native Country, as some will have it, and took upon him the Habit of St. <HI>Francis</HI> at <HI>Newcastle.</HI> Being afterwards sent to <HI>Oxford,</HI> he again fell to his Studies with great Vehemency, 'till he ar∣rived to be Doctor and Professor of Divinity. Thus he 1st expounded the Master of Sentences at <HI>Oxford;</HI> and afterwards, in the Year 1304, being ap∣pointed Professor at <HI>Paris,</HI> by the General of the Order, in the Chapter in <HI>Toulouse,</HI> he there taught a Course of Divinity. Thirdly, he did the same at <HI>Cologne</HI> with wonderful Applause; at which Time there arose at <HI>Cologne</HI> the Controversy about the Conception of the Blessed Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> whether she was conceived in original Sin or not? All the followers of <HI>Albertus Magnus</HI> af∣firm'd, that she was; <HI>Scotus</HI> and his Adherents positively asserted the contrary. Here it was that he gained the Title of Dr. <HI>Subtilis;</HI> he publish'd a Lecture on <HI>Genesis. Commentaries on the Gospels</HI> in 4 Books. Several Books on the Epi∣stles of St. <HI>Paul.</HI> Sermons of Saints, and of Particular Times. Two or three Pieces on the Master of Sentences. Quodlibets.

<P>HE dy'd miserably, 1309, being taken with an Apoplectick Fit, and too hastily buried: For, Nature having too late wrought through the Distemper, he vainly mourn'd for Assistance, 'till, at last, beating his Head against the Tomb-stone, he dash'd out his Brains, and so expir'd.

<P>THE Authority above says also, that it is a Princely House, and indeed it is no less than very stately and magnificent; being supposed the most so of any House in the whole Kingdom, within a walled Town. It is surrounded with a vast Quantity of Ground; that Part of it which Faces the Street, is thrown into Walks and Grass Plats, beautified with Images, and beset with Trees, which afford a very pleasing Shade: The other Part of the Ground on the West Side of it, is all a Garden, exceedingly neat and curious, adorned with many and the most beautiful Statues, and several other Curiosities.</P>
<P>BUT this House is not more remarkable or memorable, upon any Account, than for it's having been the Lodgings of King <HI>Charles</HI> the First, whilst he was Prisoner at this Town.</P>

From hence downwards is the most beautiful Part of the Street, the Houses on each Side of it being most of them very pretty, neat, and regular; such are the Houses of Mr. <HI>Edward Harl,</HI> Mr. <HI>Thomas Biggs, John Rogers,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> <HI>Thomas Clennell,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> <HI>Nicholas Fenwick,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> <HI>Nathaniel Clay∣ton,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> <HI>Edward Collingwood,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> Mr. <HI>Perith,</HI> Mr. <HI>John White, John Ogle,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> Mr. <HI>Thomas Waters, Matthew White,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> &amp;c. But there is one House in particular, which must be distinguished from the others for it's great Anti∣quity, and that is the House above-mentioned, called the <HI>Pilgrim</HI>'s <HI>Inn:</HI> It is on the West Side of the Street, and adjoins to the North Side of the House
<PB N="86" REF="97"/>of Mr. <HI>Edward Callingwood,</HI> just now mentioned, and is exactly 116 Yards one Foot, from the Southmost Corner of <HI>Upper-Dean-Bridge:</HI> It is holden of the Dean and Chapter of <HI>Durham,</HI> and belongs at present to Mr.<HI>James Hargrave.</HI></P>

<P><HI>BELOW this House, on the other Side of the Street, is a Lane called,</HI> Manour Chare, <HI>which leads from</HI> Pilgrim-street <HI>to St.</HI> Austin Fryers.</P>
<P><HI>A little below the East-end of this</HI> Chare, <HI>on the Right Hand, is the</HI> Tay∣lors Meeting-house: <HI>It was formerly at the very End of the</HI> Chare, <HI>in that House which Fronts</HI> Pilgrim-street, <HI>which by the Marks still remaining of a large</HI> Window, <HI>seems to have been a</HI> Chapel, <HI>as well as by the Tradition of the People thereabouts. There is a Writing in the Custody of this ancient Fraternity, which I have copied for the Curiosity of it, and is as follows.</HI></P>
<P><HI>TO THE WORSHIP OF GOD,</HI> and the Sustentation of the Procession of <HI>Corpus Christi</HI> Plays in the Town of <HI>Newcastle</HI> upon <HI>Tyne,</HI> after the laudable and antient Custom of the said Town; and for the avoiding of Disention and Dis∣cord that hath been amongst the Crafts of the said Town, as of Manslaughter and Murder, and other Mischiefs in Time coming, which hath been lately attempted a∣mongst the Fellowship of the said Crafts of the Taylors of the said Town: And to in∣duce Love, Charity, Peace, and right amongst the said Fellowship from henceforth, the Eight Day of <HI>October,</HI> in the Year of our Lord GOD <HI>1536,</HI> it is assented, agreed, and fully concluded, and accorded by all the whole Fellowship of the said Craft of Taylors then being, and that in Time to come, shall abide and dwell in the said Town of <HI>Newcastle, Robert Brandling,</HI> then Mayor, <HI>John Wren,</HI> Sheriff, <HI>Thomas Horsley, James Lawson, Gilbert Middleton, Henry Ainsley, Peter Chater,</HI> and <HI>Andrew Bewick,</HI> Aldermen, and Sir <HI>Thomas Tempest,</HI> Knt. Re∣corder of the said Town; that is to say, First, it is agreed and ordained, that every Man that has been an Apprentice in the said Town, and has fully served his Years of Apprenticohood, by the Purport of the Taylors register and record of his Master, shall be admitted to set up Shop of Taylors Craft and Work, paying at the Begin∣ning, after the old Use and Custom to the Fellowship of the said Craft, a Pot of Oyl to the said Fellowship, and Yearly to the Stewards of the said Fellowship, Thir∣teen Pence to our <HI>Lady Light,</HI> whilst he shall be of Power, and Dwelling in the said Town, or within <HI>12</HI> Miles of the same; <HI>Thirteen Pence to the Play every Year,</HI> when it shall be played; and that every Steward, Apprentice, Journeyman, or Hireman, working by the Week Four Pence a Year; and that every Hireman by the whole Year, or half Year, Three Pence to the Play every Year, when it shall be played.</P>
<P><HI>ALSO,</HI> it is ordained, that every Man of the same Craft, Born and Free with∣in the said Town of <HI>Newcastle,</HI> that was never an Apprentice in the said Town, shall be admitted to set up Shop of Taylors Craft within the same Town, for Forty Pounds, and to pay <HI>one Pound of Wax</HI> to the Fellowship of the said Craft, and a Pot of Oyl at his first Admittance; saying also Thirteen Pence to the <HI>Lady Light,</HI> Eight Pence <HI>to the Play,</HI> as is aforesaid: And if any of the said Fellowship would take excess for their Hand Labour, or if any will not give them a reasonable Rate for their Hand Labour, the said Twelve Sworn Men shall ponder and assess, duly and truly the Hand Labour, at reasonable Prices for their Work; And that none of the said Fellowship Work in their Craft upon the <HI>Saturday after Eight of the Clock at Evening,</HI> and keep Holy the <HI>Sunday, the Vigils, and Festival Days,</HI> upon Pain of <HI>Six Pound of Wax</HI> for every Default.</P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="98"/><HI>ALSO,</HI> it is ordained, that every Man of the said Fellowship, upon <HI>Corpus Christi</HI> Day, shall come to the Procession of the Time assigned, and if he come not to the Fellowship before the Procession past, to pay a Pound of <HI>Wax;</HI> and if he come not before the Procession be ended, to pay two Pound of <HI>Wax.</HI> Also that he come in his Livery, if he be warned so to do, upon Pain of a Pound of Wax: And also that none of the said Craft shall have Livery, nor go in Procession with the said Fellowship, before he hath holden Shop in the said Town by a whole Year; to the intent, that his good Conditions and Demeanours shall be known.</P>
<P><HI>ALSO,</HI> it is ordained, that he that pays not his Yearly Thirteen Pence to our <HI>Lady Light, upon St. John's Day in May,</HI> he shall pay a Pound of <HI>Wax to the same Light,</HI> over and above the said <HI>Thirteen Pence;</HI> and if he pay it not by <HI>Corpus Christi Day,</HI> then we and Fellowship following, if he be of Power so to do; and that amongst the Fellowship well known, he to be discharged of his Livery, or to make reasonable Fine for it.</P>
<P><HI>ALSO,</HI> it is ordained, that all the Taylors now in Being, and that in Time com∣ing, shall be dwelling as Fellows in the said Town, shall every Year, at the Feast of <HI>Corpus Christi Day, go together in a Livery, and play their Play,</HI> at their own Costs, after the Ordinance of their Stewards.</P>
<P><HI>ALSO,</HI> it is ordained that every Brother of the said Fellowship come in his Li∣very, when he shall be warned by their Beadle; that is to say, to the <HI>Procession upon Corpus Christi Day, St. John in May,</HI> the Day that the Plays shall be play'd, and upon the Day of their general Meeting; and that the Fellowship dispose them to have a Mass and a Dirge for the Brethren of the said Fellowship, and other Meetings to be assigned; and that at the Even of the Day of the making of the same, shall a Dirge be done, and a Mass for the Brethren of the said Fellow∣ship; and likewise shall a Dirge be done, and a Mass upon the Morn for all the Brethren and Sisters of the said Fellowship, passed, present: And that he that is of the said Craft, and not admitted to their Fellowship, who for any Cause induceing him, will have the Fellowship assembled, shall pay to their Beadle Two Pence for assembling them.</P>
<P><HI>ALSO,</HI> it is ordained, that when any Man of the Livery of the said Fellowship dyes, their Light shall go a-fore him to the Church at his Burial, and abide in the Church lighted the Mass Time, and whilst he be buried; And if there be a Dirge done, the Light not to be lighted at the Dirge Time: And when a Man's Wife of the said Livery dyes, the half of the Light shall go before her, in the said Form; and if the whole Light go a-fore her, then to pay Forty Pence to the said Fellowship, for the burning of the Light and warning it, and that the Stewards shall be there to govern the Light: And if any of the said Fellowship, reasonably warned to be there, abide not while the Mass be done, he shall pay a Pound of <HI>Wax,</HI> if he has not a reasonable excuse, to be allowed by the Stewards. And when any of the said Li∣veries shall be Wedded, if any of the said Fellowship, reasonably warned to be there, comes and abides not while the Mass is done, he shall pay a Pound of <HI>Wax,</HI> unless that he have a reasonable Excuse to be found, at the Discretion of the Stewards.</P>
<P><HI>MOREOVER,</HI> if it happens that any of the said Fellowship, being in the Li∣very, do Dye, and his good Friends will cause a <HI>Mass and a Dirge</HI> to be done for him, of their proper Cost, every Year of the Day of their Burial: If it please the said Friends of the said Brother, so Dead, to warn the Stewards; then the Beadle shall go to all the Brethren of the said Craft and Livery, and warn them to be at the <HI>Mass</HI> and <HI>Dirge,</HI> if it be done on one Day of their Livery, and them to abide the <HI>Dirge and Mass Time,</HI> upon Pain of <HI>Three Pence,</HI> without a reasonable Ex∣cuse provable; and if the <HI>Dirge</HI> be done the Night a-fore, to be at the <HI>Mass</HI> on the Morrow, and at the <HI>Dirge</HI> at their Pleasure.</P>
<P><HI>IN WITNESS</HI> whereof to the said whole Fellowship and Brethren of the said Craft, severally have set their Seals, and the said Mayor and Sheriff have set their Seals of Office, and likewise the said Alderman to this Ordinance have set their
<PB N="88" REF="99"/>
Seals, and written their own Names with their own Hand, the last Day of <HI>Janu∣ary,</HI> and in the Twenty Eighth Year of the Reign of our Sovereign Lord King <HI>Henry,</HI> after the Conquest of <HI>England,</HI> the Eighth.</P>
<P><HI>A little below this Hall of the Taylors, and the Appurtenances thereof, was probably the House of</HI> Laurentius Acton, <HI>which border'd on the</HI> South, <HI>upon the House of the present Mr.</HI> Thomas Waters. <HI>This</HI> Laurentius <HI>was Mayor of</HI> Newcastle <HI>1433, 1435, 1436, 1437, in the Reign of</HI> Henry <HI>the 6th. Opposite to this House of</HI> Laurentius Action, <HI>is the Market for Wheat and Rye, every</HI> Tuesday <HI>and</HI> Saturday.</P>
<P><HI>BELOW this again are</HI> three narrow Lanes, <HI>two on the West-side of the Street, and one on the East: Those on the West are the</HI> Nether-Dean-Bridge, <HI>leading into St.</HI> Nicholas <HI>Church-yard, which has been spoken of before, and the</HI> Painter-Hugh, <HI>or as it is called in a Writing, as old as</HI> Edward <HI>the Third's Reign,</HI> Payntourhogh, <HI>which leads into the Street called the</HI> Side. <HI>It is from</HI> Pilgrim-street <HI>a very great Descent into the</HI> Side; <HI>but it is made tollerably easy, by having</HI> Stairs <HI>on one Side of it. It seems to have got it's Name from the River flowing by the Bottom of it up to the</HI> Nether-Dean-Bridge, <HI>&amp;c. For</HI> Hugh <HI>signifies a</HI> Steep-Hill, <HI>or</HI> Bank, <HI>and</HI> Painter <HI>is a Term made use of by the</HI> Sailors <HI>for a</HI> Rope, <HI>which they fasten the Boat with. This Street therefore was called the</HI> Painter-Hugh, <HI>because it was the</HI> Hugh <HI>which the</HI> Painters <HI>were made fast to.</HI></P>
<P><HI>ONE</HI> William Porter <HI>had a House at the End of this Street, which he granted to</HI> John de Chambers, <HI>a Burgess of this Town, in the Reign of King</HI> Edward <HI>the Third,</HI> Anno <HI>1361, on Condition that he paid to the</HI> Prioress <HI>and Convent of</HI> Lambly, <HI>eighteen Shillings</HI> per Annum.</P>
<P><HI>THE other Lane or Street, on the East of this Street, is</HI> Silver-street, <HI>close by the North-side of</HI> All-hallows Church-yard; <HI>it leads into</HI> Pandon. <HI>It is said, but very improbably, to have got it's Name of</HI> Silver-street, <HI>because of the</HI> Fish-market, <HI>which was kept a little below it, at the</HI> Stock-Bridge. <HI>It was anciently called</HI> All-Hallowgate, <HI>for</HI> All-Hallowgate <HI>is said to be</HI> Ex parte Boreali Ecclesiae omnium Sanctorum; <HI>it was also called</HI> Temple-gate. <HI>Mr.</HI> Nicholas Lamb, <HI>whose House is in this Street, finds it called</HI> Jewgate, <HI>in his Writings; but when, or for what Reason it bore that Name, I know not.</HI></P>
<P><HI>WE come now to the</HI> Church <HI>of</HI> All-Hallows, <HI>which stands a little below</HI> Silver-street, <HI>and on the same Side of the Street with it,</HI> viz. <HI>at the very Bot∣tom of this</HI> Pilgrim-street.</P>

<HEAD>Sect. IV. <HI>Of</HI> ALL-HALLOWS CHURCH.</HEAD>
<P>WHO this Church was founded by, I have met with no Account, nor any of the Time it was built in; only this is certain, it must have been built before the Year 1286, but how long before, I know not. For in that Year I meet with an Account of <NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">Mr. <HI>Smith,</HI> P. 245.</NOTE> the <HI>Church-yard</HI> of <HI>All-Hallows,</HI> which is a plain Proof that the Church was then in Being.</P>
<P><HI>GREY</HI> is of Opinion that it was dedicated to <HI>All-Hallows,</HI> or <HI>All-Saints,</HI> from the ancient Name of that Part of the <HI>Town Pampedon,</HI> which he says was so called from <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>; imagining, I suppose, that it was so cal∣led
<PB N="89" REF="100"/>
of the <HI>Romans,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">All-Hallows <HI>Church.</HI></NOTE> (who inhabited this Part of the Town) after the <HI>Temple</HI> at <HI>Rome,</HI> the <HI>Pantheon,</HI> which was dedicated to <HI>all the Gods.</HI></P>
<P>THIS Church is seated upon a Hill, which is much about the same Height with the Situation of St. <HI>Mary</HI>'s in <HI>Gateshead,</HI> and upon the same Line with it.</P>
<P>IT is not so long as St. <HI>Nicholas,</HI> being only 55 Yards, one Foot, a Quar∣ter long; but it is broader, as being 25 Yards, two Foot broad. The <HI>Steeple</HI> is but or a mean Height, being a Square Tower, with only one <HI>Spire</HI> arising from it. The Bells belonging to this Church were founded in the Year 1696. They were cast out of the Metal of that famous <HI>Statue</HI> of King <HI>James</HI> the Second, which stood on the <HI>Sand-Hill.</HI> They were founded in the Ground belonging to St. <HI>Austin Fryers,</HI> in that Part of it, which is in the Back-side of the <HI>Hospital</HI> of the <HI>Holy Jesus.</HI> Their Sound is not so Melodious as the o∣thers in this Town, but the Note is exceedingly exact, and more tuneful than the others.</P>
<P>WHATEVER <HI>Robert Rhodes</HI> did to this <HI>Steeple,</HI> his Name is under the Bel∣fry of it, as at St. <HI>Nicholas.</HI> In one of the Registers belonging to this Church of <HI>All-Hallows,</HI> we have the following Account. About the <HI>Round</HI> where the Bells are drawn up into the Bell-house in the <HI>Steeple,</HI> there is written, <HI>Orate pro anima Roberti Rhodes.</HI> His <HI>Arms</HI> are also without, at the East-end of the Church, on the <HI>Breast</HI> of an <HI>Angel;</HI> which, as I take it, is a <HI>Tyger,</HI> or <HI>Grey-hound</HI> on a <HI>Chief,</HI> and <HI>three Annulets</HI> on the <HI>Escutcheon.</HI> The like is in St. <HI>Nicholas</HI> Church, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> In St. <HI>John</HI>'s also, on the Out-side of the <HI>South Porch,</HI> over-against the <HI>Alms-house,</HI> there is on a Square, <HI>Orate pro anima Roberti Rhodes.</HI> I have also seen the same in <HI>Tinmouth Castle</HI> in a <HI>Round,</HI> on the North-side, after you are within the Gate, upon the <HI>Wall;</HI> which be-like was in some Part of that great <HI>Church,</HI> when it was a <HI>Cell</HI> of St. <HI>Alban</HI>'s.</P>
<P>UPON the East-end of the <HI>Chancel,</HI> in the South-east Window, there was the Picture of our Saviour at large, but in the Time of the <HI>Rebellion</HI> it was wholly taken away.</P>
<P>NEXT to it, as you go up the South-side; there was the Picture of a <HI>Boy</HI> standing upon chequer'd Pavement, as it seemed, and on the Glass under him,
<Q><L>Like as the <HI>Jamen</HI> moist and cold,</L>
<L>Is full of Tempest Day by Day,</L>
<L>So is one Child of ten Years old,</L>
<L>Hath no Understanding, but all on Play.</L></Q></P>
<P>THE same Authority adds, I suppose the rest of the Months were also in this Window in former Times, but I have seen it only; and it was taken a∣way also in the Time of the Rebellion.</P>
<P>IN the Window above the South Door, which leads into the Quire, to∣wards the Porch, were the Pictures of <HI>Roger Thornton</HI>'s Children, <HI>Two Men</HI> and <HI>Three Women</HI> Kneeling at Altars. There remain now only <HI>Two</HI> of the Women.</P>
<P>THERE are higher up this Isle, in the Windows towards the Porch some Characters, one is like an (I) with an (S) through it, and other <HI>Three Chara∣cters,</HI> which are the Merchants <HI>Skin-mark,</HI> for they are but a little Different from the <HI>Skin-mark,</HI> which is upon the Stone of <HI>Christopher Elmer.</HI> It is a Token that some Merchant was a Benefactor to the Church, and perhaps some Part of the South Wall of the Church: I take it to be the <HI>Skin-mark</HI> of <HI>Roger Thornton,</HI> for the very same is in the <HI>Chantery</HI> of St. <HI>Peter,</HI> over-against his Tomb.</P>
<P>TRADITION says, that from the West-end of the Vestry to the Porch, the old South Wall was taken away, and rebuilt further into the Church-yard
<PB N="90" REF="101"/>
by <HI>Roger de Thornton.</HI> That the old Wall was farther into the Church than the Wall now is, is plain from the Piece of it now remaining, which is on the East-end of the <HI>Vestry;</HI> and I think the Pictures in the Windows a∣bove-mentioned, is a good Confirmation of the Truth of the Tradition of the Builder. In that Window next the Porch Door, but one, there have been the Pictures of the <HI>Twelve Apostles.</HI> There are now only remaining St. <HI>Matthew,</HI> St. <HI>James</HI> the Less, St. <HI>Andrew,</HI> St. <HI>Philip,</HI> St. <HI>James</HI> Major, and another.</P>
<P>THERE are three Galleries in this Church, one on the West-end, and, another on the East-end of the Nave, and the other in the North-Isle. That on the West-end was built in the Year 1712. The <HI>Organ</HI> which was plac'd in the middle of it was built at the same Time. It is a very long Gallery, and by much the most beautiful in the Church. On the North-end of it are the Seats of the Children belonging to the <HI>Charity-School.</HI> The Gallery on the West-end, is called the <HI>Butchers Gallery.</HI></P>
<P>THE other Gallery on the North-Isle is the <HI>Sailors Gallery.</HI> It is said in a Memorandum made at the Bottom of it, to have been <HI>built and finished by the</HI> Trinity-house <HI>in</HI> Newcastle <HI>upon</HI> Tyne, <HI>in the Year</HI> 1618, John Holbourne <HI>then Master.</HI> It was beautified in the Year 1720, <HI>Robert Bailiff</HI> being then Ma∣ster, with three or four Devices on the South-side of it. One Pannel has the Picture of <HI>St.</HI> Paul<HI>'s Shipwreck;</HI> another, our <HI>Saviour's being asleep in the Storm;</HI> then there is the Arms of the <HI>Trinity-house;</HI> another Draught is that of our Saviour's taking <HI>Peter by the Hand when he was sinking in the Waves;</HI> and the other is that of <HI>Jonah vomited up upon the dry Land.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>Chancel</HI> of this Church stands upon a large <HI>Vault,</HI> which consists of a <HI>pretty long Entrance, arched at the Top,</HI> and of a <HI>pretty large Square Room, with a curious Pillar in it,</HI> which is the grand Support of eight large <HI>Stone Arches.</HI> The Entrance into this <HI>vault</HI> is in the <HI>Church-yard,</HI> on the <HI>North-side</HI> of it.</P>
<P>AS you enter into the <HI>Chancel</HI> from the <HI>Nave</HI> of the Church, you have on the left Hand of you, an <HI>old Pair of Stairs,</HI> to which are adjoining the <HI>Stairs</HI> of the <HI>Butchers Gallery:</HI> These <HI>Stairs</HI> formerly led into the same Place, but then it was into a <HI>Gallery</HI> different from what the <HI>Butchers Gallery</HI> is now. They led into a <HI>Loft</HI> or <HI>Gallery</HI> called the <HI>Rood Loft.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>Rood</HI> was an Image of our Saviour upon the Cross, made generally of <HI>Wood,</HI> and placed on a <HI>Loft</HI> made for that Purpose, just over the Passage out of the <HI>Church</HI> into the <HI>Chancel;</HI> out of this Mystery, they say, that the <HI>Church</HI> represents the <HI>Church Militant,</HI> and the <HI>Chancel</HI> the <HI>Church Triumphant;</HI> and who will pass out of the Former into the Latter, must go under the <HI>Rood Loft,</HI> that is, they must go under the <HI>Cross, and suffer Affliction.</HI> This <HI>Image</HI> was wont to have the <HI>Virgin Mary</HI> on one Side of it, and St. <HI>John</HI> on the o∣ther. <HI>Stavely, C. Hist. P.</HI> 199.</P>
<P>A few Years ago the <HI>Chancel</HI> was beautifyed. It is pannel'd round with Wainscot. The Table is a large curious <HI>Marble Stone,</HI> which was given to the Church for that Use by an unknown Hand. On the large Pannel, im∣mediately above the <HI>Altar,</HI> is this Figure; <Q>I. <SEG REND="decorInit">H</SEG>. S.</Q> or, <HI>Jesus Hominum Salvator:</HI> Above that again is the Picture of a <HI>Dove,</HI> cu∣riously carved in <HI>Wood;</HI> and above that again, in a <HI>Golden Glory,</HI> is the great Name of God <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, which signifies his most absolute self Existence: <HI>He was, and is, and is to come.</HI></P>
<P>THIS is to point out, by way of Emblem, the Persons of the <HI>Trinity.</HI> God the Father, by the Word <HI>JEHOVAH,</HI> he having order'd <HI>Moses,</HI> when
<PB N="91" REF="102"/>
he went to the <HI>Israelites,</HI> to bring them out of <HI>Egypt;</HI> to say, <HI>I</HI> <NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">Exod. iii. 14.</NOTE> <HI>AM hath sent thee,</HI> or the Lord <HI>Jehovah,</HI> who exists eternally, or always is. The <HI>Dove</HI> is the Emblem of the <HI>Holy Ghost;</HI> for he is said to have descended <HI>in a bodily Shape like a</HI> <NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg">Mark iii. 16.</NOTE> <HI>Dove.</HI> And the Letters with the Cross in the Middle of them, Point out the second Person of the <HI>glorious Trinity,</HI> who dyed upon the Cross for the Sins of the World.</P>
<P>ON the Top of the East-end of the Altar, above the Things now menti∣oned, are the Representations of <HI>Three large Candles,</HI> which are an Emblem of the <HI>Light of the</HI> <NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">Vid. Vulg. Antiquit' P. 133. &amp; Wheatley Com. Pray∣er. Pa. 109.</NOTE> <HI>Gospel,</HI> which either is, or shou'd be read at the <HI>Altar.</HI></P>
<P>ON the <HI>South-side</HI> of the <HI>Altar</HI> is a <HI>Prothesis,</HI> or <HI>Side-Altar,</HI> that the Priest, according to the <HI>Rubrick,</HI> may more conveniently Place the Elements upon the <HI>Altar.</HI></P>

<P><PB N="92" REF="103"/>THERE were <HI>Seven Chanteries</HI> belonging to this Church. The Chantery of St. <HI>Thomas;</HI> The Chantery of our <HI>Lady;</HI> The Chantery of St. <HI>John,</HI> the Evangelist; The Chantery of St. <HI>Peter;</HI> The Chantery of St. <HI>Catherine;</HI> The Chantery of St. <HI>Elgie</HI> or St. <HI>Loye,</HI> and the Chantery of St. <HI>John</HI> the Baptist and St. <HI>John</HI> the Evangelist.</P>
<P N="1">1. THE Chantery of St. <HI>Thomas</HI> was founded by <HI>John Puthore,</HI> Clerk, the Yearly Value 4 <HI>l.</HI> 8 <HI>s.</HI> 4 <HI>d.</HI></P>

<P N="3">3. THE Chantery of St. <HI>John</HI> the Evangelist, founded by <HI>Richard Willisby</HI> and <HI>Richard Fishlake;</HI> the Deed of Foundation is lost; which arose out of some Tenements situated in the Sandhill and Side; 4 <HI>l.</HI> 15 <HI>s.</HI> 4 <HI>d.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. THE Chantery of St. <HI>Peter</HI> is that waste Place above the Vestry, oppo∣site to the Tomb of <HI>Roger de Thornton.</HI> This was founded by the said <HI>Roger de Thornton,</HI> as appears from the Licence granted to the said <HI>Roger</HI> <NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg"><P>Vide <HI>Foun∣dation of St.</HI> Catherine<HI>'s Hospital.</HI></P>

It was erected about the Year 1411, that he might be pray'd for whilst he liv'd, and his Soul when he was dead (by a Priest set a-part for that Purpose) together with the Souls of his Father and Mother; and <HI>Angnes</HI> his Wife, and also of his Ancestors and his Children, and the whole Company of the Faithful departed, as is mentioned in the King's Grant to him.</P>
<P>ON the East-end of this Chantery there are still remaining the Pictures of St. <HI>Lewis,</HI> St. <HI>Barbara,</HI> and St. <HI>Elisabeth.</HI></P>
<P>THE yearly Value of this Chantery was 6 <HI>l.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. THE Chantery of St. <HI>Catherine</HI> was founded in the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the Third, by <HI>Robert</HI> of <HI>Chirton,</HI> Burgess of <HI>Newcastle,</HI> and <HI>Marriot</HI> his Wife, who was the Daughter and Heirefs of <HI>Hugh Hankyn</HI> and <HI>Beatrix</HI> his Wife; The yearly Value of it, 5 <HI>l.</HI> 3 <HI>s.</HI> 8 <HI>d. All-Hallows Vest.</HI></P>
<P>IN the Book above-mentioned, belonging to the Church of <HI>All-Hallows,</HI> we are told, that there is at the South-East End of the Church, upon the Out-side, a fair <HI>E</HI> and <HI>F,</HI> and on each of them half a Catherine-Wheel; but what they signify no Man living knoweth. At present there is no such Thing. Whose Name the Letters were placed for, I believe it is indeed impossible for any Man living to tell: But as for the Catherine-Wheels, it is easy to conclude that they are plac'd on the South-East end of the Church to signify that St. <HI>Catherine</HI>'s Chantery or Altar was under the South-East Window.</P>
<P N="6">6. THE Chantery of St. <HI>Loye</HI> or St. <HI>Elgie,</HI> founded by <HI>Richard Pickering</HI> in the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the 3d, the yearly Value 3 <HI>l.</HI> 8 <HI>s.</HI> 4 <HI>d.</HI></P>
<P><HI>JOHN Dent,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> by Deed dated 12th of <HI>Feb.</HI> in the 35th Year of <HI>Hen.</HI> the 6th, granted an annual Rent of 8 <HI>s.</HI> issuing out of his Houses, to <HI>Richard Doxforth</HI> the then Priest of this Chantery.</P>
<P N="7">7. THE Chantery of St. <HI>John</HI> the Baptist, and St. <HI>John</HI> the Evangelist by <HI>John Ward.</HI> 7 <HI>l.</HI> 15 <HI>s.</HI> 8 <HI>d.</HI></P>
<P>AMONGST the Chanteries of this Church we meet with none of the <HI>Holy Trinity;</HI> but in the 16th of the Reign of King <HI>Hen.</HI> the 8th, after the <HI>Mari∣ners</HI> became a Body, and their House was called the <HI>Trinity-house,</HI> we find an Altar in it dedicated to the <HI>Trinity;</HI> for in one of their Writings 'tis said, that <HI>Thomas Hebborne</HI> should be Partaker of all <HI>Masses, Good-Prayers,</HI> and <HI>Suffrage,</HI> which should afterwards be celebrated, said, and done by the <HI>Chaplain</HI> and <HI>Priest</HI>
<PB N="93" REF="104"/>
of the said Fraternity within the <HI>Trinity-house,</HI> and at the <HI>Trinity-Altar</HI> within the Church of <HI>All-Hallows</HI> for evermore.</P>
<P>I know not where to fix the Place of this Altar, any more than I can fix particularly, the Places of some of the ancient Chanteries; except it was, as some will naturally Conjecture, in the <HI>Porch</HI> behind their <HI>Gallery.</HI> And yet there are some Reasons against this Supposition; For this <HI>Porch</HI> was a <HI>Chan∣tery,</HI> they had only an <HI>Altar;</HI> and as a <HI>Chantery,</HI> it must have been filled with a <HI>Priest,</HI> who had an <HI>Altar</HI> to himself and consequently their <HI>Altar</HI> must have been some where else. If it be said that they perhaps built this <HI>Porch,</HI> I an∣swer, that if they had done so, it would have been called a <HI>Chantery</HI> not on∣ly an <HI>Altar.</HI> Besides, the Building is visibly older than their <HI>Chapel,</HI> their <HI>Priest,</HI> or their <HI>Altar.</HI> For they can scarce be supposed to have had any one of the <HI>Three,</HI> before the Beginning of the Reign of King <HI>Henry</HI> the Eighth, and that's a Date too late for so old a Piece of Building.</P>

<P><HI>RALPH Fell,</HI> Merchant Adventurer, 11th <HI>Feb.</HI> 1680.</P>
<P><HI>JOHN Simpson</HI> Hoastman, and <HI>Jane</HI> his Wife their Burial Place. In this Grave of theirs was buried their eldest Son <HI>Anderson,</HI> so called as being a De∣scendant of the worthy and loyal Family of the <HI>Anderson</HI>'s of <HI>Braidley,</HI> who suffer'd so much in the Time of the Civil Wars, in Defence of their King and Country. He dyed <HI>May</HI> the 17th <HI>Anno</HI> 1730, in the 21st Year of his Age. He was a Youth of fine Parts, and good Learning, a great deal of Sweetness of Temper, and strict Religion.</P>
<P>THERE is in this Part of the Church a very large Stone, insculp'd with Brass, of which several Years ago no more could be read than <HI>hic Tumulatus — dono dei datus mitis clero — promotor Ecclesiarum.</HI> My Authority imagines this to be the Burial Place of <HI>Robert Rhodes.</HI> He says, the Picture upon the Stone was very like that of <HI>Roger Thornton;</HI> all the Difference is, that the Gown of this Picture is not so deep as that of <HI>Thornton</HI>'s. He conjectures it to be the burial Place of <HI>Robert Rhodes;</HI> because of the Words <HI>Promotor Ecclesiarum,</HI> lib. <HI>All-Hall'.</HI> The Words <HI>Promotor Ecclesiarum</HI> are not now to be found. How∣ever, had they been there still, I think they are but a weak Argument to prove that <HI>Robert Rhodes</HI> was buried here, when it is considered that he founded a Chantery in St. <HI>Nicholas,</HI> that his own Soul, and his Wife's might be prayed for. For People were generally buried in the same Church, and near the very Place, where they erected a Chantery or an Altar.</P>
<P>BUT whoever it is, this I think may be safely concluded from the Gran∣deur of the <HI>Grave Stone,</HI> that he was some wealthy Person; and from his be∣ing <HI>Promotor Ecclesiarum,</HI> that he was also Religious.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Effigies</HI> is very Tall, and is surrounded with very curious Pictures of the Saints, and some other Things; but the Brass is now tearing off, and going very fast into Ruin. It is a pity it should not have more care taken of it, as it is an Ornament to the Church, and the Monument of it's Benefactor. The <HI>Promoters</HI> of <HI>Churches</HI> should be always remember'd with the most grate∣ful Respect, that they may be shining Lights to the most distant Ages.</P>
<P>I shall close the Monuments of this Church with an Epitaph, said to have been made upon <HI>Robert Wallas,</HI> formerly Clerk of this Church.</P>
<Q><L>Here lies <HI>Robin Wallas,</HI></L>
<L>The King of good Fellows;</L>
<L>Clark of <HI>All-Hallows,</HI></L>

<P>THESE Children have Coats and Caps once a Year, and Shoes, Stock∣ings, Shirts, and Bands twice a Year: And at their leaving the School, they have Forty Shillings each to put them out Apprentice, or equip them for Services, and each of them a Bible, with the Common-Prayer, a Whole Duty of Man, and <HI>Lewis</HI>'s Catechism.</P>
<P>THE Magistrates of <HI>Newcastle</HI> gave a Room, wherein the Girls are taught, and contributed towards Building a Gallery in <HI>All-Saints</HI> Church for the Chil∣dren, and likewise gave Ground, whereon to build a School for the Boys, and a House for the Master: The Charge of which was defrayed out of se∣veral Legacies left to the School.</P>
<P>TWO Hundred Thirty Four Boys and Girls have been in all put out since the School was set up.</P>
<P>IN the Year 1728, some Gentlemen of this Parish founded a Lecture by Subscription, for the Instruction of the People in the <HI>Rubrick</HI> and <HI>Liturgy</HI> of the Church. It was settled upon <HI>Henry Bourne,</HI> the Curate of this Church, and was opened on <HI>Low-Sunday</HI> the said Year.

<P>THE <HI>Curate</HI> of this Church is the Minister of it.

It was formerly the Custom to have two Clerks for this Church. But in the Year 1708, it was thought more convenient for the Parish, and less Burthensome to the <HI>Minister</HI> (who had one of the largest Cures in the Kingdom to manage) to have an Assistant; accordingly <HI>Abraham Wil∣cox,</HI> M. A. was put into the Clerk's Place, which was vacant by the Death of <HI>John Pinkney,</HI> and was allow'd the Fees of the Clerk for Weddings, Bu∣rials and Christnings; which amounts to 50 <HI>l.</HI> per Annum: Mr. <HI>Wilcox</HI> was succeeded by <HI>Ambrose Fenwick,</HI> M.

<P>THERE are Prayers at this Church every Day at 10-o'Clock in the Mor∣ning, and 4 in the Afternoon. The Sacrament is administred at this Church every second Sunday in the Month. It was formerly usual for the Town to present this Church, at the <HI>High Festival of Easter,</HI> with twenty one Gallons of Wine.</P>
<P>OPPOSITE to the <HI>West Stairs</HI> of this Church is an <HI>Alms-House,</HI> which was in good Repair, as we are informed by the <HI>Milbank</HI> Manuscript, about 100 Years ago, at which Time the <HI>Church-Wardens</HI> allowed them 20 <HI>s. per Annum,</HI> for Coals for four Women. It is now in very bad Repair, and go∣ing fast into Ruins. At present the People in it, are allowed eight Chaldron of Coals <HI>per Annum,</HI> and three Shillings <HI>per</HI> Quarter by the Church-wardens.</P>
<P>ON the <HI>South-side</HI> of this Church are two Pair of Stairs; those opposite to the <HI>Quire-Door</HI> lead into a narrow Street called the <HI>Dog-bank;</HI> but former∣ly, as appears by some ancient Writings, <HI>Silver-street:</HI> The other Pair lead into the <HI>Butcher-Bank,</HI> which is a narrow Street, and a great Descent. It is mostly inhabited by <HI>Butchers,</HI> who have their Shops and Houses there. In this are many narrow Lanes called <HI>Chares,</HI> which lead into the <HI>Key-side.</HI> This leads into the Street called the <HI>Side,</HI> and into the <HI>Sand-hill.</HI> It was called formerly <HI>All-Hallows Bank.</HI></P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. IX.</HI> Of the CASTLE-YARD.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>N order now to go regularly down into the lower Parts of the Town, let us set off from the South-side of the Steeple of St. <HI>Nicholas,</HI> which leads dire∣ctly to the Top of the Street called the <HI>Side.</HI> Whilst I am here I can't help observing, that were the Hou∣ses belonging to Mr. <HI>Partis,</HI> &amp;c. which are situated from the Porch Door of St. <HI>Nicholas,</HI> to the said Street, taken away, the Belfry and Steeple would look much more grand and magnificent; and whereas this <HI>Great Ornament</HI> of the Town is now almost hid as a Traveller comes up this Street, it would then be wholly expos'd, and strike the Beholders with Awe and Wonder.</P>
<P>AFTER you have crossed the upper Part of this Street, there is a Passage leading to <HI>Bailiff-Gate,</HI> which has a Turn upon the Left-hand, that goes into the <HI>Castle-yard,</HI> the Place where is situated the <HI>Castle</HI> of this Town.</P>
<P><PB N="110" REF="121"/>BEFORE the Conquest the old <HI>Round Tower</HI> was probably in Being, and was the <HI>old Castle,</HI> or <HI>Fort</HI> of <HI>Monkchester;</HI> and after the Conquest, when the other Castle was built, it was called, (to distinguish it from the <HI>old Castle</HI>) the <HI>New-Castle,</HI> which in a small Time after gave Name to the whole Place. Some∣thing to this Purpose are these two or three Words about it, in the Manu∣script of <HI>John Milbank,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> <HI>That this new Castle may be distinguished from the old one.</HI> The Use of this Tower, as the same Authority informs us, was made to secure the <HI>Pass</HI> to the <HI>Bridge</HI> in former Times.</P>
<P>THIS <HI>new Castle</HI> was built by <HI>Robert Curthois,</HI> the Son of <HI>William</HI> the Con∣queror in the Year 1080 as has been before observed. But notwithstanding this, and that it gives a new Name to the Place, yet whatever Priviledges be∣longed to <HI>Monkchester</HI> (for so the Town was then called) continued with it, nor did the <HI>Castle</HI> impair them in the least.</P>
<P><NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">De reb. Novocast.</NOTE>IT has been a Building of very great Strength, and very fit for what it was design'd, and yet in the Reign of King <HI>John</HI> we have an Account of it's being repair'd by that King, and that he was obliged in the making of a <HI>Ditch</HI> to destroy divers Houses, for which he satisfied the Owners, as may be seen in our Account of that King's Charter to this Town.</P>
<P>THE first Account we meet with of it after it was built, is of it's being be∣sieged by <HI>William Rufus.</HI> For <HI>Robert Mowbray,</HI> Earl of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> having opposed him, he came down and laid Siege to the Castle, and con∣quer'd <HI>Newcastle;</HI> upon which <HI>Robert</HI> fled, and absconded in <HI>Bamburgh-Castle;</HI> but was afterwards taken by the King's Party, and carried Prisoner to <HI>Windsor.</HI></P>
<P>AMONG several Rents and Revenues arising to this Castle, the following were some.</P>
<P>THE Barony of the <NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">William Herron, Hen. I. eum Feost:</NOTE> <HI>Herons,</HI> which contain'd <NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg"><P>One <HI>Wil∣liam</HI> regular∣ly descended from this <HI>William</HI> died in the 25th of <HI>Edward</HI> the 1st, and left no Male Issue; so that <HI>Emelin,</HI> his only Daughter, was the Heir of the Barony. She married into the Family of <HI>John</HI> Lord <HI>D' Arcy,</HI> and transferr'd this Manour of <HI>Haddeston</HI> and divers others into that Family. Lord <HI>D' Arcy</HI> abovementioned, dy'd possess'd of this Manour at <HI>Nor∣ton</HI> in <HI>Lincolnshire,</HI> 30th <HI>Edward</HI> the 3d. In the 1st of <HI>Hen. IV. Thomas</HI> Lord <HI>Lumley</HI> died pos∣sess'd of it, and left it to Sir <HI>John Lumley</HI> his Brother. This Family is so named from <HI>Lomley</HI> a Town situated on the Bank of the River <HI>Were,</HI> where their Seat was. They are descended from <HI>Liulph,</HI> a Person of great Nobility in the Time of King <HI>Edward</HI> the Confessor, who married <HI>Algitha</HI> the Daugh∣ter of <HI>Aldred,</HI> Earl of <HI>Northumberland.</HI> Sir <HI>George Lumley,</HI> Knight, he that married the Grand-daughter of <HI>Roger Thornton</HI> of this Town, was in great repute in the County of <HI>Durham,</HI> in the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the 4th, being High Sheriff in the 2d of that Reign; in the 6th, Knight of the Shire; in the Year <HI>8,</HI> High Sheriff again, in which Office he continued three Years more.</P>
<P>But none of this great and ancient Family was ever higher in the Esteem of his Prince, none in greater Repute in his Country, than is the present noble Successor, <HI>Richard,</HI> Earl of <HI>Scarborough,</HI> who is also Viscount <HI>Lumley</HI> and <HI>Waterford,</HI> Baron <HI>Lumley</HI> of <HI>Lumley,</HI> Master of the Horse to his Majesty, Lord Lieutenant of the Counties of <HI>Durham</HI> and <HI>Northumberland,</HI> Knight of the most Noble Order of the Garter, one of his Majesty's most honourable Privy-Council, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P></NOTE> <HI>Haddeston, Chirton,</HI> <NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg"><P>This Village is about two short Miles distant from the Town of <HI>Newcastle.</HI> How it came out of the Hands of this Family of the <HI>Herons,</HI> is not known. But in the 11th of <HI>Edward</HI> the 2d, it was the Lordship of <HI>Jeffrey de Scrope,</HI> of <HI>Masham</HI> in <HI>Yorkshire.</HI> After him <HI>Ralph,</HI> Lord <HI>Graystake,</HI> was Lord of it. In the Reign of K. <HI>Henry</HI> the 6th, this Manour was in the Possession of <HI>William Fitz Hugh,</HI> who dy'd and left it to his Son <HI>Henry.</HI> It is now in the Possession of Mr. <HI>Tho.

<P><PB N="111" REF="122"/>THE <NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">Hen. I. Simonem de Devilstone, Feof:</NOTE> Barony of <HI>Dilstone,</HI> containing <NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg"><P><HI>Dilston,</HI> a small Vil∣lage, stand∣ing on the South-side of the <HI>Tyne,</HI> call'd in old Books and ancient Records, <HI>Devilstone,</HI> from a small Brook running on the West-side of it whose Name <HI>Bede</HI> says was <HI>Devilsburn,</HI> and emptying itself into <HI>Tyne.</HI> The Barony in which it stands takes it's Name from it, and is at this Day called the Barony of <HI>Devilstone.</HI> We have not yet met with the Origi∣nal Barons of it. We observe a Family in our ancient Histories, bearing the Surname of <HI>Deivill</HI> or <HI>Deiville,</HI> which might probably be Owners of the Manour of <HI>Devilstone,</HI> i. e. the Town of <HI>Devils,</HI> for <HI>John Deiville</HI> was Governour of <HI>Scarborough</HI> Castle in <HI>Yorkshire,</HI> and built a Castle of his own at a certain Place called the <HI>Hode</HI> in that County; but having no ground for this Conjecture in History, we shall leave it to the Reader to accept, or reject it, tho' the Name being a little Unusual, and looking as if its Original were derived from the Evil Spirit that bears that Name, we thought fit to give some Account of it.</P>

He, making a Settlement of his Great Estate in the 7th of <HI>Edw,</HI> the 3d, gave two Parts of this Manour to his Son and Heir <HI>Henry Percy,</HI> which he then was in Possession of, and the third Part after the Death of <HI>Hawise,</HI> the Widow of <HI>John Clavering,</HI> who held it then in Dower; but this <HI>Henry</HI> died seized of the whole Manour, <HI>Feb. 26, 26 Edw. 3.</HI> and left it with other great Estates to his Son and Heir of the same Name, who accordingly soon after the Livery of his Lands, saving to his Mother <HI>Idonea</HI> her reasonable Dower, who had assigned her for it among other Lordships this of <HI>Corbridge,</HI> which was not long come into his Possession; but it was settled upon his Death upon his secured Wife <HI>Joan</HI> for her Dower, How this Manour was alienated in the same Reign we cannot discover; but do find <HI>10 Rich.</HI> 2d. that <HI>Alice</HI> the Widow of <HI>Ralph</HI> Lord <HI>Nevil</HI> of <HI>Raby</HI> had for her Dowry among other Manours and Rents, Twenty Pounds <HI>per ann.</HI> out of his Manour of <HI>Corbrigge.</HI></P>
<P>At this Day there is nothing remarkable in this Town but the <HI>Church</HI> and a little <HI>Tower-house,</HI> fitted up and inhabited by the <HI>Vicars</HI> of the Place; yet there are so many <HI>Ruins of ancient Buildings,</HI> as prove it once to have been a large and spacious Town. King <HI>John</HI> supposing that either an Earthquake or some sudden Invasion might be the Cause of so great Desolations, and the Inhabitants had no Time or Way to remove their Wealth, did not doubt but he might find a great Deal of Treasure upon a diligent Search; but Fortune fauoured his Attempt no more than it did <HI>Nero</HI>'s in his Enquiries after the concealed Riches of <HI>Dido</HI> at <HI>Carthage,</HI> for he found nothing but Stones mark'd with Brass, Iron and Lead.

And this he conjestures, because in the <HI>Saxon, Chestre</HI> is called <HI>Concester,</HI> and because it is but a few Miles from the Wall. But others are of Opinion, that <HI>Benwall,</HI> a Village about two Miles West of <HI>New∣castle,</HI> was the ancient <HI>Condercum,</HI> because of the Antiquity of the Place, and its Nearness to the Wall; the <HI>Notitia</HI> described the <HI>Condercum,</HI> as upon the <HI>Line of the Wall.</HI></P>
<P>This indeed seems rather probable. For if a Place is said to be situated <HI>ad lineam valli,</HI> one would think it should not be far from the Wall, however not in the wrong Side of <HI>Tine.</HI> The Places of the <HI>Roman</HI> Garrisons <HI>ad lineam Valli,</HI> as far as I can iudge, have always been in these Counties which the <HI>Roman</HI> Wall past through; but no Body seen yet found out the least Footsteps of it in the County of <HI>Durham.</HI></P>

Richardum de Gaugye <HI>Feof.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Gaugye,</HI> containing <HI>Ellingham,</HI> <NOTE N="w" PLACE="marg"><P><HI>Cramlington,</HI> the Manour and Estate of <HI>Robert de Gaugi,</HI> a great Man in the Reign of King <HI>John,</HI> and by him entrusted with the Government of divers Castles at Times, to defend them against the rebellious <HI>Barons,</HI> which he did faithfully and to his own Advantage; for 3d <HI>Henry III.</HI> it was certified, that the Barony of this <HI>Robert</HI> (now as we conceive, called the Barony of <HI>Caugif,</HI> for <HI>Gaugi</HI>) in this County, consisted of this and divers other Manours, which he held of the King by the Service of three Knights Fees. This Manour is now the Property of <HI>Robert Lawson,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> of <HI>Chirton.</HI></P></NOTE> <HI>Crawlington,</HI> <NOTE N="x" PLACE="marg"><P><HI>Heaton</HI> is a small Village distant from <HI>Newcastle</HI> about a Mile and a Half Eastward. It has been handed down by Tradition to the present Day, that it was a Place of Retreat for King <HI>John</HI> when he came into this Country, and there are still to be seen the Ruines of an <HI>ancient Building,</HI> now in the possession of <HI>Richard Ridley,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> which carries the Name of <HI>King</HI> John<HI>'s Palace.</HI> Whatever Truth there may be in this Tradition, this is certain, that there is in the said <HI>Gentleman</HI>'s Ground on the <HI>North-side</HI> of this old Building, the Remains of a Fortification, which 'tis natural to conjecture, was built for the Safety and Security of this House, and con∣sequently this House must have been of some great Distinction. And when it is further considered, that this Village of <HI>Heaton</HI> is a Part of the <HI>Barony of</HI> Robert de <HI>Gaugy,</HI> it may not be improbable to conclude, that this ancient Building has in some Measure been what Tradition says it was. For <HI>Robert de Gaugy</HI> was a great Man in the Reign of King <HI>John,</HI> and was entrusted by him (as has just now been observed) with the Government of divers Castles at Times, to defend them against the <HI>rebellious Barons,</HI> which he did faithfully and to his own Advantage; for in the 3d of <HI>Henry III.</HI> it was certified, that the Barony of this <HI>Robert</HI> in this Coun∣ty, consisted of this and the other Manours, which he held of the King by the Service of <HI>Three Knights Fees.</HI></P>
<P>This <HI>Robert</HI> therefore might have had his own House here upon this Part of his Barony; and as he was so faithful a servant to King <HI>John,</HI> and entrusted by him with Matters of such great Concern, it is not impro∣bable but when the King came to these Parts, he lodged at this House; and this perhaps was the Reason of its getting the Name it hears at this Day.</P>
<P>This is its ancient Grandeur; its present is, the House and Family of the worthy Gentleman above mentioned; it was built in the Year <HI>1713,</HI> it is a beautiful House, and so situated, that on the <HI>West</HI> it overlooks the <HI>Town-Moor, Fenham,</HI> and Part of the Lands of the Prior of <HI>Tinmouth;</HI> on the <HI>East</HI> it faces the <HI>Sheilds Road;</HI> on the <HI>North</HI> it has a most agreeable Prospect to the Windings of the <HI>Ouse-Burn,</HI> of its Woods and Banks, and of the Villages situated on it. On the South it faces the River <HI>Tine.</HI> Its Conveniencies and Beauties a∣bout it, are on the West-side a <HI>Fish-Pond, Groves, Wilderness, Gardens, Avenues,</HI> and Numbers of Plan∣tations. On the <HI>East</HI> a very large and beauteous Quadrangle, whose Walls are shaded with the choicest Fruit-Trees, and whose <HI>Area</HI> is adorn'd with Variety of <HI>Knots</HI> and <HI>Flowers.</HI> In this <HI>Area,</HI> at a due Distance, are two <HI>Images</HI> tall as the Life, which declare the Hand of a curious <HI>Statuary.</HI> On the <HI>North</HI> are Gardens and Plantations, and on the <HI>South</HI> an <HI>Area</HI> Adorned with Images and a pleasing Gravel-Walk, beset with Trees and bordered with Flowers.</P>
<P>This Gentleman the Possessor was eldest Son to <HI>Nicholas Ridley,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> who was born at <HI>Hardriding,</HI> in the Parish of <HI>Haltwhistle,</HI> the ancient Mansion-house of the Family of the <HI>Ridleys;</HI> where is still to be seen above one of the old Doors, the Date of the Year of its Building, which was earlier than the Conquest, and the initial Letters of the Name of the Builder, <HI>N. R.</HI></P>
<P>This <HI>Nicholas</HI> was of the younger Branch of the <HI>Ridleys</HI> of <HI>Wilmotes-Wike;</HI> the Seat as Mr. <HI>Cambden</HI> says, of the <HI>worshipful Family of the Ridleys,</HI> which is a pretty large <HI>Castle</HI> on the South-side of <HI>Tine,</HI> and very ancient, as appears from several Things about it.</P>
<P>A little above this, upon the Banks of the <HI>Tine,</HI> is the Estate of Mr. <HI>Nicholas Ridley,</HI> the younger Son of the said Gentleman.</P>
<P>This <HI>Nicholas,</HI> Senior, was <HI>twice Mayor of</HI> Newcastle, in the Year <HI>1688,</HI> and in the Year <HI>1706,</HI> and was esteemed a Man of great Honour and Integrity, and an excellent Magistrare. By his last Will and Testament, dated 7th <HI>December 1710,</HI> he gave and bequeathed to the Poor of the Parish of <HI>Haltwhistle 40</HI> s. <HI>per annum,</HI> out of a little Farm or Tenement called <HI>Waggtail</HI>-Hall. He also gave a Rent-Charge of 4 <HI>l.</HI> and <HI>10 s. per an∣num</HI> to the Poor of <HI>Newcastle</HI> upon <HI>Tine,</HI> and <HI>50 l.</HI> to the Poor of the City of <HI>Carlisle.</HI> Which said Charities he order'd to be distributed every Year to the more aged and infirm, eight Days before <HI>Christmas.</HI> He left also <HI>20 l.</HI> to the Poor of the Township of <HI>Hexham.</HI> He died <HI>January</HI> 22d <HI>1710,</HI> and hes buried in St. <HI>Nicholas</HI> in this Town, at the Entrance into the <HI>Chancel</HI> from the Body of the Church.</P>
<P>Of this younger Branch was <HI>John Ridley</HI> of <HI>Hardriding,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> who was <HI>Major</HI> of a Regiment in the Army of the right Honourable <HI>William</HI> Marquis of <HI>Newcastle,</HI> for the Service of King <HI>Charles I.</HI></P>
<P>Besides the Gentlemen of this Family already mentioned, we shall only take Notice of the two Persons following.</P>
<P><HI>Nicholas Ridley,</HI> first Bishop of <HI>Rochester,</HI> and then Bishop of <HI>London.</HI> He was born here, and being edu∣cated in Grammar at <HI>Newcastle</HI> upon <HI>Tyne,</HI> and in academical Learning in both <HI>Universities,</HI> where he took his Doctor's Degree, was first made Master of <HI>Pembroke-Hall</HI> in <HI>Cambridge,</HI> then Chaplain to King <HI>Edward VI.</HI> and at length Bishop. He was a Person small in Stature but great in Learning, and a profound Divine, of whom Dr. <HI>Caius</HI> says, that <HI>quo viro nihil integrius &amp; egregiis Dotibus ornatius,</HI> being Good as well as excel∣lently endowed. He wrote many Things against the Popish Doctrines, and at length confirmed his Writings with Sufferings, being burnt near <HI>Baliol-College</HI> in <HI>Oxford,</HI> Anno <HI>1555,</HI> 2d &amp; 3d <HI>Phil, &amp; Mar.</HI> He had a Hand in compiting the <HI>Common-Prayer-Book,</HI> now in Use in the Church of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thomas Ridley,</HI> Doctor of the Civil Law in Cambridge; he was the Son of <HI>Lancelot Ridley,</HI> and Grand∣son of <HI>Nicholas Ridley,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> he was educated in Grammar at <HI>Eaton,</HI> and in academical Learning at <HI>King's College, Cambridge,</HI> where he was Fellow. Afterwards he became a School-master at <HI>Eaton,</HI> one of the Ma∣sters in Chancery, when he was Knighted, Chancellor to the Bishop of <HI>Winechester,</HI> and Vicar General to Doctor <HI>George Abbot,</HI> Archbishop of <HI>Canterbury.</HI> He was a general Scholar, and wrote a <HI>View of the Civil and Ec∣clesiastical Law.</HI> He dy'd <HI>Jan. 23, 1628,</HI> and was buried four Days after in the Parish Church of St. <HI>Bennet,</HI> near St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s Wharf, <HI>London,</HI> We meet with one <HI>Mark Ridley,</HI> a Physician, a Person of that Note, as to be one of the eight Pricipals of the College of Physicians, and a Writer; but we do not find that he was of this Family at <HI>Wilmotes-wick.</HI> Mag.

Robert</HI> being thus disappointed, took a Body of Men out of the Garrison of <HI>Rox-borough,</HI> and invading the Borders with Banners display'd, burnt <HI>Prestten,</HI> and this Town, and then joining himself with <HI>William Wallis,</HI> the famous <HI>Scotch</HI> General committed great Spoils upon the <HI>English</HI> in these Nor∣thern Parts. His Estate was for these Rebellions Actions consiscated, but after his Death, restored to his Daugh∣ter and Heir, <HI>Margaret de Ross,</HI> upon an Allegation, that he had, before his Death, come to an Accord, with <HI>John Comin</HI> of <HI>Badenagh,</HI> for himself and all his Arms with him, to be safe as to Life, Liberty, and Estate.

Cuthbert de Boroughdon, Joannes de Fenwick, Joannes de Wodhorne, Joan∣nes de Lilleburne, Willielmus de Tyndale, Roger Manduit,</HI> and <HI>Robertus Darreius</HI> were High Sheriffs of <HI>Northumberland.</HI> During which Time it is affirmed, the <HI>Great tower,</HI> and also the lesser ones of the said <HI>Castle,</HI> the <HI>Great Hall,</HI> with the <HI>King's Chamber</HI> adjoining to it, together with divers other Cham∣bers below in <HI>Queens Mantle,</HI> and the <HI>Buttry-Cellar</HI> and <HI>Pantry;</HI> The <HI>King's Chappel</HI> within the Castle, a certain House beyond the Gate, which is called the <HI>Checker-house,</HI> with the Bridges within and without the Gate, with three <HI>Gates</HI> and one <HI>Postern,</HI> are 300 <HI>l.</HI> worse than they were.

The House of the Baron of <HI>Werk</HI> was built over the <HI>Postern.</HI></P>
<P>THERE were two great strong Walls which surrounded the Castle. The interior Wall was of no great Distance from the Castle itself, as may be still seen in several Places. The exterior Wall surrounds the Verge of the <HI>Castle</HI> Bounders. From this <HI>outer Wall</HI> were four Gates, the <HI>Great Gate</HI> and three Posterns. The North-side of the <HI>Castle</HI> is the <HI>main Gate,</HI> called now the <HI>Black Gate.</HI> It has had two Port-Cullicesses, one without the Gate, as may be still seen, and another within it at a little Distance from it, the Ruins of which were to be seen a few Years ago. There still remains a Piece of the old Wall, which shews its Situation to have been where that House is, which was lately purchased by Mr. <HI>Jasper Harrison;</HI> the Shop belonging to this House was dugg (as I was informed) out of the Wall just now mentioned. On the East-side of the <HI>Castle</HI> there was a <HI>Postern,</HI> which led down to the Street called the <HI>Side,</HI> which is still to be seen; it was once called (but ma∣ny Years after it was in Decay) the <HI>Waist of</HI> Laurentius Acton.

<P>THERE is an House in the Yard, where they say was the <HI>Chapel</HI> of the Garrison, which is called the <HI>Chapel-house</HI> to this Day; it stands <HI>North-east</HI> from the Chapel; its common Name now is the <HI>three Bulls Heads.</HI></P>

of <HI>Newcastle,</HI> in the <HI>Castle-Garth;</HI> as in other Parts of the Town of <HI>Newcastle.</HI></P>
<P>AN Inquisition in the Reign of <HI>James</HI> I. says, that the ancient <HI>Castle,</HI> be∣longing to the King, situated within the Walls of <HI>Newcastle</HI> upon <HI>Tine,</HI> be∣longs to the County of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> and is surrounded with a great Stone-Wall. That below the Castle there is a great <HI>Hall,</HI> where the County of <HI>Northumberland</HI> holds their Assizes. There is also a great <HI>Tower,</HI> full of Chinks, under which are two Vaults, which are the Places where the Pri∣soners of the County of <HI>Northumberland</HI> are kept, which are within the Circuit of the Castle itself.</P>
<P>AND that there is in Being the exterior Wall of the Castle, which begins North of the Castle, about six Yards from the <HI>Great Gate,</HI> which leads into the <HI>Castle-yard;</HI> and so goes on eastward and southward by the Back of some Houses in the <HI>Side.</HI> Then it goes westward by the Back of some Houses in the <HI>Sand-hill;</HI> then it crosses the <HI>Castle-stairs,</HI> which lead to the Street called the <HI>Close,</HI> and from thence behind the Houses, even to the upper <HI>Pinion-Ga∣vel</HI> of the House of <HI>James Clavering</HI> Alderman, which is about nine Yards distant from the long Stairs, where the said ancient Wall, on account of its Decay, does no farther appear; but yet the Bounds and Limits of the Castle go through the middle Part of a House, extending itself even to the Channel in the long Stairs. Then it goes along the Channel upwards on the Outside of the new Wall, which was built to enclose the <NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg">The high and great Heap, <HI>viz.</HI> the Dunghill on the West∣side of the Castle, was taken away by Sir <HI>John Marley</HI> Mayor, and his Adhe∣rents, to ram∣part the Town-Walls against the Parliament and Com∣monwealth,</NOTE> Dunghill. From thence it goes to the Corner of the House of <GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> and thence by the Back-part of the House of <GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> where the ancient outward Wall begins. This ancient outward Wall of the Castle contains by Measure three Acres of Ground and one Rood.</P>
<P>IN the 18th of this King's Reign, another Inquisition was held at <HI>New∣castle</HI> about the Castle, wherein Complaint was made of the <HI>Dunghill</HI> men∣tioned in the Bounds of the Castle, that it had increased to such a Bigness, that it was in Length 98 Yards, the Depth of it was 10 Yards, and the Breadth of it 32 Yards; which being such a prodigious Weight upon the Wall on the West-side of the Castle (which Wall was in Length 40 Yards, in Height 10 Yards, in Breadth 2 Yards) that a great Part of it is intirely thrown down and subverted to the great Detriment of the Strength of the Castle. The Damage was computed at 120 <HI>l.</HI></P>
<P>IT was also by this same Inquisition complained of, that the great square Tower was full of Chinks and Crannies; and that one Third of it was almost taken away: That all the Lead and Covering which it had of old was im∣bezled and carried of, insomuch that the Prisoners of the County of <HI>Northum∣berland</HI> were most miserably lodged, by reason of the Showers of Rain falling upon them. They computed the Charge of repairing it would be 809 <HI>l.</HI> 15 <HI>s.</HI> 0 <HI>d.</HI></P>
<P>IT has been a Building of great Strength, and no little Beauty; the vast Thickness of the Walls speaks the one, and the Ruines of some curious Workmanship speaks the other. The grand Entrance into the Castle was at the Gate facing the South, which leads up a Pair of Stairs (which still shew the Magnificence of the Builder) to a very stately Door of curious Masonry. The Room this leads into, has its Floor broken down close to the Castle-Wall, as indeed all the other Floors are to the Top of the Castle; so that ex∣cepting the Floor above the County-Goal, there is not one left, tho' there have been five Divisions or Stories of the Castle besides this. This floored Room which I was told was lately flagg'd by the Order of <HI>William Ellison,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> Alderman, when he was last Mayor in the Year 1723, seems to me without any Doubt, to have been the <HI>common Hall</HI> of the Castle, because on the North-side of the same Room there is an Entrance by a Descent of some Steps into a Room, where is the largest Fire-place I saw in the Castle, which plainly speaks it to have been the Kitchen. At the End of this there are se∣veral
<PB N="120" REF="131"/>
Stairs, which lead into a Place under the Kitchen, which I think goes down as low as the Bottom of the Castle. This I take to have been a Cel∣lar, as I do also that little <HI>dark Place</HI> on the right Hand coming up again, to have been a Sort of a Pauntry.</P>
<P>THE Door I mentioned just now on the East of the Castle, which leads to the first broken down Floor, is because of it's Grandeur and Beauty, an Argument that this Room has been the most stately one in the whole Castle; another Reason for it's being so, is because of the Windows which gave Light into it. Those of them that face the East are the most beautiful of the whole Castle; besides, on the South of this Room there is an Entrance into a Sort of a Parlour or withdrawing-Room, which has a Fire Place in it; which has been a Piece of curious Workmanship, as is visible to this Day; and this Place has no Communication with any Part of the Castle but this Room. On the North-side of this Room, is a Door leading into an Apartment, where stands a Well of a considerable Depth, it was 18 Yards before we touch'd the Surface of the Water; which seems to have been placed there on purpose for the more immediate Service of <HI>this Room:</HI> There are some little Basons on the Top of the <HI>Well,</HI> with Pipes leading from them, which conveyed Water to different Appartments of the Castle; This is plain from what may be obser∣ved in the <HI>County Goal,</HI> at the Bottom of the Castle; the round stone Pillar in it, having an Hollow in the Middle, of a Foot wide, with a lead Spout in the Side of it.</P>
<P>IN the Inquisition made in the 9th of <HI>Edward</HI> 3d abovementioned, among other Things that were complained of for being neglected, one was <HI>Capella Do∣mini Regis infra Castrum.</HI> This Chapel I have been told, stood on that Part of the Castle Yard, where the Moot-hall is; but upon Searching, I found it in the Castle itself according to the Account of it just now mentioned. The Door of it is at the Bottom of the South Wall of the Castle, adjoining to the Stairs which lead into the State Chamber. It has been a Work of great Beau∣ty and Ornament, and is still in the midst of Dust and Darkness, by far the most beautiful Place in the whole Building; the Inside of it being curiously adorned with Arches and Pillars. It is easy to observe the different Parts of it, the <HI>Entrance,</HI> the <HI>Body of it,</HI> and the <HI>Chancel;</HI> on the left Side of the En∣trance you go into a dark little Room, which undoubtedly was the Vestry. The full Length of it is 15 Yards, the Breadth of it is 6 Yards and half. It had 3 or 4 Windows towards the East, which are now all filled up, nor is there any Light but what comes in at a little Cranny in the Wall.</P>
<P>Nicholas de Byker <HI>Tenet terras suas ut faciat districtiones ad Ward' Novi Ca∣stelli super Tynam faciend' &amp; pro deb' Domini Regis inter Tynam &amp; Cocket, &amp;c.</HI> And then my Authority goes on to say, that the Manour of <HI>Byker</HI> was Sir <HI>Ralph Lawson</HI>'s Knight, deceased, after of <HI>Henry Lawson,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> his Son, and now of his eldest Son, who without all Question is Bailiff by Inheritance of the said Castle, and is to levy these Castle-ward Cornage, and other Rents, Issues, Fines, and Amerciaments, belonging to the said Castle. And as he goes on, the Constable of the Castle, when that Office is settled, may ap∣point the learned Stewards to keep Courts, and then the Officers for the said Castle will be compleat. Besides the Rents above-mentioned, a great Num∣ber of Houses, Yards, and Gardens paid to it.</P>
<P>IN the 17th of <HI>James</HI> I. 1619, a Grant was made of the Scite and De∣mesnes of the Castle to <HI>Alexander Stephenson,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> who was succeeded by one <HI>Patrick Black,</HI> who died, and left it in the Possession of his Wife. After that one <HI>James Langton,</HI> Gent. claimed <HI>Patrick Black</HI>'s Right, but by Virtue of what is not known.</P>
<P>THE Liberties and Privileges of the Castle extends Northwards to the Ri∣ver of <HI>Tweed,</HI> and Southward to the River of <HI>Tees.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="132"/>IT is reported, that underneath that House which was anciently the Coun∣ty Goal, is a <HI>Vault</HI> which leads to the Castle. There is indeed a large Door still to be seen, which perhaps was the Entrance into it; and Mr. <HI>George Grey,</HI> the present Possessor of the House, told me that it was certainly so, be∣cause he had put down thro' his own Floor a Bailiff's Rod to the very End, and could find no Bottom.</P>
<P>A Manuscript I have often had Occasion to mention gives us the following Account of the Castle-Yard.</P>
<P>THE Way thro' the Yard begins at the <HI>Castle-Yate,</HI> and when I was young, there was no Houses in it but the House of one <HI>Thomas Southern,</HI> and the House of one <HI>Green;</HI> these Houses were near the Gate before you came into the Ca∣stle-yard; and there was in the Garth a House, wherein the <HI>Goaler</HI> of the Ca∣stle dwelt, and a House wherein <HI>William Robinson</HI> dwelt, who was Deputy Herrald under <HI>Norroy, King at Arms.</HI> This Man wrote in a Book the Arms of all the Mayors of this Town, from <HI>Laurentius Acton,</HI> until his Time. And when I was Chamberlain of the Town, which was about the Time of Sir <HI>Nicholas Cole</HI>'s being Mayor in the Year 1640, it was then in the Town's Chamber; when <HI>Trollop</HI> built the <HI>Town-Court,</HI> he borrow'd it, but would ne∣ver restore it.</P>
<P>THESE were all the Houses at that Time; but since then Mr. <HI>Bulmer,</HI> he took a Garth behind his House in the <HI>Side,</HI> and built a Stable in it, and had a Garden in it; and also <HI>George Hayroy</HI> took from thence to the <HI>Moat-hall,</HI> and built Houses upon it: He was a Butcher, but not a Freeman, and these took their Lands and Houses of <HI>Alexander Stephenson,</HI> a Scottish Man, who came in with King <HI>James,</HI> for he begg'd the Castle of the King. He was one of his Close-Stool. This Man began to build the Castle-Gate, but it was finished by one <HI>John Pickle,</HI> who made it in the Fashion it is now, and kept a Tavern in it; and then one <HI>Jordan</HI> a Scotsman and <HI>Sword-Kipper,</HI> built the House on the South-side of the Gate, and lived in it; and <HI>Thomas Reed,</HI> a Scotch Pedlar, took a Shop in the North-side of the Gate.</P>
<P>AT present there are a good many Shops and Houses belonging to it, in and about it.</P>

<P>HAVING now considered the <HI>Castle,</HI> and what belongs to it, we return back to the <HI>Side,</HI> the Street from which we entred the <HI>Castle-yard.</HI></P>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Sect. I <HI>The</HI> SIDE.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HIS Street is from the Head of it, to the <HI>Stairs</HI> on the left Hand, a very great descent, and lies narrow, untill you come to the middle of it, from which Place it opens in a spacious Breadth, and so continues to the <HI>Sandhill.</HI> It is from the one end to the other fill'd with Shops of <HI>Merchants, Goldsmiths, Milliners, Uphol∣sters,</HI> &amp;c. The East-side of this Street, from the Upper Part of it to <HI>All-hallow Pant,</HI> was called <HI>Cordiner,</HI> or <HI>Cordwainer Rawe.</HI></P>
<P>ABOVE the middle of the Street are Stairs leading up to the Castle-yard, which was the Eastern-Postern of the Castle, and after called the Waste of <HI>Laurentius Acton,</HI> as appears from the Account of <HI>Gunner Tower;</HI> and our Towns-man, <HI>Grey,</HI> says, that in the Middle of this Street is an antient <HI>Stone-House,</HI> an Appendix to the Castle, which in former Times belonged to the Lord <HI>Lumley,</HI> before the Castle was built, or at least coetany with the Castle.</P>
<P>ON the other Side of this Street, opposite to the Waste now mentioned, is a <HI>Corner Shop,</HI> which formerly belong'd to a Chantery in St. <HI>John</HI>'s Church. On the same Side of this Street, almost opposite to this Eastern-Postern of the Castle, is a short narrow Lane, (which formerly seems to have gone by the Name of <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Vide Gun∣ner-Tower.</NOTE> <HI>Swinburn-place</HI>) which leads by Stairs into a dark narrow Lane which faces the <HI>Painter Heugh</HI> that leads into <HI>Pilgrim-street.</HI> On the North∣end of this Lane there was a Place called <NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Vide Gun∣ner-Tower.</NOTE> <HI>Pencher Place,</HI> perhaps the whole Lane was called so. It goes as far as the <HI>Nether-dean-bridge,</HI> under which is now a Ware-house of Mr. <HI>James Moncaster,</HI> Merchant. Under this I am

told the <HI>Rings</HI> are still to be seen that the <HI>Boats</HI> were fastned to, which brought up the Merchant Goods, when the Merchants had their Shops in the <HI>Flesh-market.</HI> On the South it leads to the Side.</P>
<P>THE Pant standing near the Shop of Mr. <HI>Robert Makepeice,</HI> is undoubted∣ly that which went by the Name of <HI>All-Hallow-Pant;</HI> The other Side of the Street from <HI>All-Hallow-Pant</HI> to the <HI>Cale-Cross,</HI> was formerly divided by the coming up of the River, which was called <HI>Lorkburn,</HI> and the East of it had the Name of <HI>Flesher-Raw:</HI> because I suppose the Butchers had their Shops there, as well as on the <HI>Butcher-Bank:</HI> The West bore the Name of the <HI>Side.</HI> Af∣ter that, <HI>Lorkburn</HI> was cover'd with Flags at the Top, and made one Street, which all goes by the Name of the Side. In the Year 1696 <HI>Lorkburn</HI> was arch'd at the Top, and pav'd over.</P>
<P>WE come now to the <HI>Cale-Cross,</HI> so called because of the <HI>Cale</HI> or <HI>Broth</HI> which was sold there in former Times. This seems to have been it's original Name, for I meet with it in the Reign of King <HI>Richard</HI> the Second, as may be seen in the Account of <HI>St. Margaret</HI>'s Chantery in <HI>St. Nicholas,</HI> and also in a Writing dated <HI>Edward</HI> the Third. What <HI>Grey</HI> says of it is still just, that it is a fair Cross, with Columns of Stone Hewn, covered with Lead: There is at the Top of it a Cistern which holds the <HI>New-Water.</HI> Here is sold Milk, Eggs, Cheese, Butter, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>

These poor People were called the <HI>Brethren</HI> and <HI>Sisters</HI> of St. <HI>Katharine</HI>'s, Hospital; for to this Saint was the Hospital dedicated.</P>
<P>IN the 34th of <HI>Henry</HI> VI. <HI>Roger Thornton</HI> granted to the Mayor and Com∣munity of <HI>Newcastle,</HI> the Use of the <HI>Hall</HI> and <HI>Kitchen</HI> belonging to the Hos∣pital of the blessed <HI>Katharine</HI> the Virgin on the <HI>Sandhill.</HI></P>
<P>IN the Year 1629, Sir <HI>Richard Lumley,</HI> in Consideration of 100 <HI>l.</HI> con∣vey'd to the Mayor and Burgesses of <HI>Newcastle,</HI> and their Successors for ever, all that Building of Stone covered with Lead, standing near to the Water of <HI>Tine,</HI> and to the East-part of the Town's Chamber, being about 16 Yards in Length, and anciently Part of the <HI>Hospital of St.</HI> Katharine <HI>the Virgin.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">Grey.</NOTE>UPON this Building stands the stately Court of the <HI>Merchant-Adventurers</HI> of the <HI>Old Staple,</HI> resident at that flourishing City of <HI>Antwerp</HI> in <HI>Brabant;</HI> since removed to the more northern Provinces under the <HI>States.</HI> Their Char∣ters are ancient, their Privileges and Immunities great; they have no Depen∣dence upon <HI>London,</HI> having a Governor, twelve Assistants, two Wardens and a Secretary. The present Governor is <HI>Richard Ridley,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> Alderman of this Town, who has been Governor of this Company for many Years.</P>
<P>THIS Room in ancient Times, as we are inform'd by the <HI>Milbank Ma∣nuscript,</HI> was given to the Town for a young Couple, when they were mar∣ried, to make their Wedding-dinner in, and receive the Offerings and Gifts of their Friends; for at that Time Houses were not large. 'Tis true indeed, the Houses in the <HI>Flesh-market,</HI> which were built many Years before this up∣on
<PB N="125" REF="136"/>
the <HI>Sandhill,</HI> had most of them Rooms near as stately, if not altogether as stately as this Room is; but then they were the Houses of the <HI>Great Mer∣chants and Aldermen of the Town.</HI> So that the Tradition of this Room may be true enough.</P>
<P>THIS Hall is adorn'd with the Arms of several <HI>generous Benefactors,</HI> and some of the most curious carv'd Work in Wood. Here it is that for some Years by past, the annual Feast of the Sons of the Clergy has been held.</P>
<P>ADJOINING to the West End of this ancient Building, was the <HI>Town-Court,</HI> which was built by that worthy Man <HI>Roger Thornton.</HI> This was pull'd down and the present one erected <HI>Anno</HI> 1658. Alderman <HI>Weimoth</HI> by Will, dated the 11th of <HI>April,</HI> gave 1200 <HI>l.</HI> towards it, and the Town was at the rest of the Charge, which amounted to above 10000 <HI>l.</HI> Mr. <HI>Joshua Douglas</HI> the Town-Clerk accounts for it in this Manner.</P>

<P><HI>TROLLOP</HI> had, as Mr. <HI>Douglas</HI> also acquaints us, 50 <HI>l.</HI> for setting up the <HI>King's Arms</HI> in the <HI>Court</HI> and Bridge, and 50 more for finishing them, and making the <HI>Conduit</HI> on the <HI>Sandhill.</HI></P>
<P>THIS Building, as to its Form and Model, is of great Beauty, and withal very sumptuous. That Part of it, which is the <HI>Court</HI> itself, is a very stately <HI>Hall,</HI> whose lofty Cicling is adorn'd with various Painting, and its Floor laid with checker'd Marble. On the <HI>East end</HI> of it is a Dial, and the Entrance into the <HI>Merchants Court.</HI> On the West are the <HI>Benches,</HI> where the Magi∣strates sit, raised considerably above the Floor of the <HI>Court,</HI> above which are the Pictures of King <HI>Charles</HI> II. and King <HI>James</HI> II. large as the Life. On the North a Gallery for Spectators; and on the South the Windows, which are very pretty, particularly that Window which is a <HI>Katharine-Wheel,</HI> in which is a large Sun-dial of painted Glass, with this Motto, <HI>Eheu Fugaces!</HI> Under this is a large <HI>Balcony,</HI> which overlooks the River. Here it is that the <HI>Mayor</HI> and <HI>Sheriff</HI> keep their Courts, and the Judges at <HI>Lammas</HI> hold the Assize. Here is kept the <HI>Guilds,</HI> the Court of <HI>Admiralty,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>ON the North-side of this <HI>Hall</HI> is a magnificent Entrance into a Passage, which leads into a large Room called the <HI>Town's Chamber.</HI> Here it is that the <HI>Mayor</HI> transacts the common Business of the Town. Here the Common Council is held, where the <HI>Mayor</HI> sits on a Bench distinguishable from the others, the Aldermen on each Side of him, the Common Council below upon Chairs placed on each Side the Room, and separated from the Benches, as the Court itself is separated from the Benches there. And here upon the Days of <HI>Rejoicing,</HI> the <HI>State Holidays,</HI> the Mayor not long ago entertained the <HI>Ma∣gistrates</HI> and <HI>Burgesses</HI> with a Banquet of Wine, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to which they were wont to come from the <HI>Mayor</HI>'s <HI>House</HI> with great Pomp and Solemnity. At the West-end of the Room is a small Apartment, or withdrawing Room, where the Magistrates upon Occasion retire, where the ancient Records of the Town are kept, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Under this Court and Chambers are the <HI>Weigh-house</HI> and <HI>Town-house.</HI> The former is for weighing all Sorts of Commodities; for in the Reign of King <HI>Henry</HI> VI. Brass Weights according to the Stand∣art were sent to this Town. The latter is the Place where the Clerk of the Chamber and the Chamberlain are to receive the Revenues of the Town for <HI>Coal, Salt, Ballast, Grind-Stone,</HI> &amp;c.<NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">Grey.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="126" REF="137"/>BEFORE I leave this Street, I must by no Means omit the Effigies of King <HI>James</HI> II. which stood here, as I have been told, on that Side of the Bull-ring next the Court-stairs. By the Account I have had (for I never saw the Statue itself, nor the Picture of it) it must have been a very curious Work. The King's Picture on Horseback was cast in <HI>Copper</HI> large as the Life; the Horse stood upon his Hind-Feet, raised upon a Pedestal of <HI>white Marble,</HI> which was surrounded with <HI>Iron-Pales.</HI> It cost the Town 1700 <HI>l.</HI> and was confess'd the most beautiful and curious of its Kind that was in the whole Kingdom. Certainly it was a great Ornament to the Town, and 'tis therefore great Pity it is not still in Being, tho' it was the Statue of an un∣fortunate King. But there is no Bounds to the heady Proceedings of a fu∣rious Mob; it drives all before it, without either Reason or Reflection, and bears no Regard to Things either Civil or religious. Such a one I am told was this, that pull'd down the <HI>noble Statue;</HI> a few Soldiers, as drunk with Loyalty as with Liquor, assisted by the busy hot-headed Genius of <HI>Sandgate,</HI> having provided Ropes for that Purpose, pull'd it down, dragg'd it from thence to the <HI>Key,</HI> and threw it into the <HI>River.</HI> This was in the Year 1688; it was afterwards taken up again, and Part of it cast into a Set of Bells, which now belong to <HI>All-Hallows</HI> in this Town.</P>

<HEAD>Sect. III. <HI>The</HI> CLOSE.</HEAD>
<P>ON the East of this Street is the Entrance to the <HI>Key-side,</HI> which shall be spoken hereafter. On the <HI>West</HI> is the <HI>Close,</HI> to which as you go along, you pass by the <HI>North-side of the Chapel of St.</HI> Thomas <HI>the Martyr;</HI> and on the other Side opposite to this <HI>Chapel,</HI> an ancient House which is said to be built by <HI>Richard de Emmeldon,</HI> Mayor of <HI>Newcastle,</HI> for three Priests to pray for his Soul. I take it to be nigh those Stairs which lead up to the <HI>Half-Moon,</HI> the ancient outward Fortification.</P>
<P>FROM hence going on still Westward, you cross over the North-end of the <HI>Tine-bridge,</HI> and so pass into the Street called the <HI>Closs.</HI> It answers its Name exactly well, for it is but narrow and close too. It was formerly that Part of the Town where the principal Inhabitants liv'd, Sir <HI>John Marly,</HI> Sir <HI>William Blacket,</HI> Sir <HI>Mark Milbank;</HI> and the Houses of many other Gentle∣men of Figure are still remembred by the ancient Inhabitants. And indeed however the Street itself may be, however mean the Fronts of the Houses are, within they speak Magnificence and Grandeur, the Rooms being very large and stately, and for the most Part adorn'd with curious <HI>Carving.</HI> The Earl of <HI>Northumberland</HI>'s House was in this Street; it was that House which has at its Entrance a <HI>great Gate,</HI> besides which there is a large round Ball of Stone, the House on this Side Mr. <HI>Thorp Stewart</HI>'s. In the lower Part of this Building, towards the Water, are very manifest Tokens of its Antiquity</P>
<P>OF late Years these Houses have been forsaken, and their wealthier Inha∣bitants have chosen the higher Parts of the Town.</P>
<P>ON the right Hand as you enter the Street from the <HI>Tine-Bridge,</HI> are Stairs which lead into the <HI>Castle-yard,</HI> which were the <HI>Southern Postern</HI> of the Castle, and are called the <HI>Castle-stairs.</HI> On the same Side a little further along, are <HI>other Stairs,</HI> which are called the <HI>Long Stairs,</HI> which lead up to the <HI>Bailiff-Gate, Backraw, Castle-yard, Side,</HI> &amp;c. almost opposite to which is a small
<PB N="127" REF="138"/>
<HI>Key,</HI> called <HI>Javel-Gripp.</HI> Somewhat further along are <HI>other Stairs</HI> on the same Side of the Street, leading to <HI>West-gate,</HI> which are called <HI>Tudhill-Stairs.</HI> Perhaps it is not amiss to tell you what I have been somewhere inform'd of, that the pro∣per Name of it should be <HI>Tout-hill,</HI> from the touting or winding of a Horn upon it, when an Enemy was at Hand. What makes me the more incline∣able to believe this Tradition to be true, is, that Cornage was paid to the Castle, as may be seen in our Account of it. Now <HI>Cornage</HI> comes from the Word <HI>Cornagium,</HI> (from <HI>Cornu</HI> a Horn) and was a Kind of grand Serjeanty: The Service of which Tenure was to blow a Horn, when any Invasion of the <HI>Scots</HI> was perceived; and by this many Men held their Land Northward, a∣bout the <HI>Picts Wall. Cambd. Britan.</HI> 609 Pag. and <HI>Littleton,</HI> Fol. 35.</P>
<P>ALMOST opposite to these Stairs is the House of the Mayors of <HI>New∣castle,</HI> where they reside during the Year of their Mayoralty. It is a Build∣ing grand and stately; and considering the Place it stands in, is very orna∣mental. As the Mayors of <HI>Newcastle</HI> have such continual Business at Court, tho' the Situation is not so pleasing as that of the upper Part of the Town, it is yet more advantageous, as it is nigher the Court.</P>
<P>BEYOND this House a little Way, still going on Westward, is the Gate belonging to this Street, called the <HI>Close-Gate.</HI> The Town-wall descends from the <HI>West-Friar Tower,</HI> down a dangerous Pair of Stairs, upon a very steep Bank, to this Gate, from which it goes Southward to the Water-side, where is an old Tower, now the Hall of the Sail-makers.</P>
<P>WITHOUT this <HI>Close</HI> Gate is a Way to the <HI>Forth,</HI> a Place of Recreation.</P>
<P>IN the <HI>Close</HI> were many Houses, which pay an annual Rent to the Master and Brethren of St. <HI>Mary</HI> the Virgin.</P>
<P>THIS Street is commemorated in many ancient Writings for a Mill, which (in ancient Times, long before these were drawn) was wont to stand upon the <HI>Hoga,</HI> that is, upon the <HI>Bank</HI> without the <HI>Close-Gate.</HI> In a Grant from the Master and Brethren of St. <HI>Mary</HI>'s in <HI>West-gate,</HI> it is permitted to the Parties concern'd, that they have <HI>quandam placeam terrae in Vico quoe voca∣tur</HI> le Closs, <HI>sicut se extendit in longitudine de Hoga, ubi</HI> antiquum molidinum <HI>solebat stare, usque ad aquam</HI> Tinae, &amp; <HI>quantum de</HI> Tina <HI>acquirere poterit.</HI></P>

<HEAD>Sect. IV. TINE-Bridge.</HEAD>
<P>IN coming into the <HI>Close,</HI> we cross'd the End of the <NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg"><P><HI>The Bridge is of great Antiquity, undoubtedly as old as the Times of the</HI> Romans. <HI>There must have been a Communication between this and the other Side of the River; and therefore there was a Necessity for it. The ingenious Mr.</HI> Horsley, <HI>p.</HI> 104, <HI>says,</HI> I think there are some certain and visible Remains of a military Way on <HI>Gateshead</HI>-Fell, pointing directly towards the Part, where I suppose the Station has been at <HI>Newcastle,</HI> and coming, as I apprehend, from <HI>Chester le Street.</HI> Dr. <HI>Hunter</HI> as∣sured me, he had also observ'd visible Remains of such a Way. And it is the common Opinion, that there has been a military Way from <HI>Chester</HI> to <HI>Newcastle;</HI> this Way tends towards the Place where the Bridge now is. There must then have been a Bridge in the <HI>Roman</HI> Times over the River <HI>Tine,</HI> near the Place where the present Bridge stands.</P></NOTE> <HI>Tine</HI>-Bridge, let us now return and consider it a little. It has been a Query, whether the Bridge was originally of Wood or Stone; but I think it is altogether need∣less; all the Bridges in <HI>England</HI> were originally of Wood. In the Reign of
<PB N="128" REF="139"/>
<HI>Richard</HI> I. <HI>Philip</HI> Bishop of <HI>Durham</HI> sent to the Burgesses of <HI>Gate-Side</HI> a Grant of <HI>Forestage,</HI> in which are these Words: <HI>And it shall be lawful for every Bur∣gess to give Wood to whomsoever he will, to be spent about the River of</HI> Tine, <HI>without any Licence.</HI> This I imagine has been for the building of Keys, and especially for the repairing of the <HI>Bishop</HI>'s Part of the Bridge, which is a fur∣ther Proof, that this Bridge, which was the original one, was <HI>Wood.</HI> But what I think puts it beyond Dispute, is, that according to <HI>Matthew Paris,</HI> it was burnt in the Year 1248, together with a great Part of the Town.</P>
<P>AFTER this Misfortune hapned, the Town, who repairs two Thirds of the Bridge, and the <NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg"><HI>Thomas Ruthall,</HI> Bi∣shop of <HI>Dur∣ham,</HI> in the Reign of <HI>Henry VII.</HI> built or re∣pair'd the third Part of the Bridge o∣ver the River <HI>Tine,</HI> to∣ward the South. <HI>Good∣win.</HI></NOTE> Bishop the other, laid out their Endeavours to raise up another Bridge of <HI>Stone.</HI> Accordingly the Bishop of <HI>Durham</HI> sent out Indul∣gences, and the Town procured other Bishops to do the same, to all those that would assist either with Money or Labour in the erecting of it. By which Means they got such a Sum as was sufficient.</P>
<P>THE Archdeacon of <HI>Northumberland</HI> wrote to the Clergy of his Archdea∣conry, and desired them to assist the Work of the <HI>Bridge</HI> as much as they could, telling them, their venerable Father the Lord Bishop of <HI>Durham</HI> by his Letters Patents, had commanded them without any Let or Delay, to go about the Affair of <HI>Indulgences,</HI> and that they were to prefer the Episcopal Indulgences to others. And what arose from them was to be given to the <HI>Master of the Bridge,</HI> who was then <HI>Laurentius,</HI> for the Use of the Bridge. <HI>Lib. Cart.</HI></P>
<P>IN like Manner the Official of <HI>Carlisle</HI> promised an Indulgence of 10 Days to any one, that would assist the repairing of <HI>Tine</HI>-Bridge.</P>
<P><HI>WALTER</HI> Bishop of <HI>Rochester</HI> on the 8th of the Ides of <HI>September,</HI> in the Year of our Lord 1277, granted an <HI>Indulgence of</HI> 20 <HI>Days</HI> to all that bestowed Part of the Substance GOD had given them, to the repairing of the <HI>Tine</HI>-Bridge, or would assist the repairing of it, by working at it with their own Hands.</P>
<P>IT is supposed by some, that <HI>William</HI> St. <HI>Barbara</HI> sent the following Indul∣gence; but that can't be, for he liv'd a great while before the Bridge was built. It was therefore <HI>Walter</HI> Bishop of <HI>Durham,</HI> who in the 8th Year of his Pontificate sent it, dated at <HI>Weremouth.</HI></P>

<P><Q>FORASMUCH as the Apostle says, that <HI>We must all stand before the Judgment-seat of Christ, to receive as we have done in the Body, whether it be good or bad;</HI> we ought to prevent the Day of the last Harvest, by doing Works of Mercy, and looking towards heavenly Things, and to sow on Earth what we shall reap in Heaven, with manifold Fruit, holding a firm Hope and Trust; Because he that sowes in Peace shall reap in Peace, and he that

<P>FOR the Collection of these Alms, and receiving them, there was one con∣stituted the <HI>Custos</HI> or <HI>Guardian</HI> of the Bridge, which was sometimes also the Master of St. <HI>Thomas</HI> the Martyr, as may be observed in the Account of those Charities.</P>
<P>IN the 43d of <HI>Edward</HI> the 3d, an Inquisition was made, whereby it was found, that the Bridge was so decay'd, that 1000 <HI>l.</HI> would not repair it; and that 20 Marks belongs to the said Bridge, and to the <HI>Chapel of St.</HI> Thomas <HI>the Martyr,</HI> built upon the same, 10 whereof was paid to the Master of the said <HI>Chapel,</HI> for himself, and his Clerk, and the remaining ten Marks to the Bridge Master Builder.</P>
<P>THIS Bridge, after it was repaired, stood upon 12 bold Arches, but now there are only 9, the rest being turned into Cellaring, at the Building of the Keys. It is a pretty Street, beset with Houses on each Side for a great Part of it. In the Entrance from the North into it, stands the Chapel of St. <HI>Tho∣mas</HI> the Martyr, sometime Archbishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> so called, because it was dedicated to him. Who the Founder of it was I have never been able to learn, nor the Time of it's Building; but it must have been after the Year 1171, the Year when the <HI>Martyr</HI> suffer'd, and it must have been built before the Year 1248, because then it was in being.</P>
<P>IN this <HI>Chapel</HI> were <HI>Three Chanteries.</HI></P>
<P>THE Chantery of St. <HI>Anne</HI> in the Chapel of St. <HI>Thomas</HI> upon <HI>Tine</HI>-Bridge, was founded by <HI>William Herryng,</HI> valued at 4 <HI>l.</HI> 17 <HI>s.</HI> and arose out of certain Tenements on the <HI>Sandhill.</HI></P>
<P>THE Chantery of our <HI>Lady</HI> in the said Chapel: No Deed of Foundation to be shewed, but the Incumbent now being is Resident upon the same, and he and his Predecessors, some say, always presented by the Mayor of <HI>Newcastle</HI> for the Time being, and <HI>Christopher Threkeld</HI> Patron, valued at 4 <HI>l.</HI> 3 <HI>s.</HI> 6 <HI>d.</HI> which arose out of certain Tenements in the <HI>Close</HI> and <HI>Side.</HI></P>

<P>THE present Master is the Rev. Dr. <HI>Thomlinson.</HI></P>
<P>THIS Chapel was lately beautified and Pewed, and on Sunday the 10th of <HI>September</HI> 1732, (the whole Body of the Magistrates coming to it with the usual Solemnities and Formalities) was set apart by the Corporation for a Chapel of Ease to the Church of St. <HI>Nicholas.</HI> The Sermon in the Morning was preached by the Rev. Mr. Vicar; that in the Afternoon by the Rev. Mr. <HI>Clayton.</HI> The officiating Ministers are the Rev. Mr. <HI>Cowling,</HI> who preaches on the Sunday Morning, and the Rev. Mr. <HI>Cuthberts,</HI> and the Rev. Mr. <HI>Clay∣ton,</HI> on the Sunday Afternoon alternately.</P>
<P>A little beyond this is a large and strong Building, which <HI>Grey</HI> informs us, was built a little before the Writing of his History, upon an Arch of the Bridge, and used for a <HI>Magazine</HI> for the Town. Under this are the Shops of <HI>Francis Rudston,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> Alderman, and Mr. <HI>William Sorsby.</HI> There is very visible above this Gate-way, the Remains of a Port Cullice. After the <HI>Restoration,</HI> the Picture of King <HI>Charles</HI> the 2d, was set up on the South side of this Buil∣ding, with this Motto under it, <HI>Adventus Regis, Solamen Gregis; The coming of the King, is the Comfort of the People.</HI> It was wont to look exceedingly beautiful, and in coming along the Bridge from the South, was a very wor∣thy and conspicuous Ornament to the Town; but of late it is pretty much obscur'd with Dust, if not defac'd with the Weather, through the Want of being put into a little Order and Regularity.</P>
<P>ON the North-side of this Building is an Account of it's being repair'd in the Year 1713. <HI>Henry Reay,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> Mayor; <HI>Joseph Green,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> Sheriff.</P>
<P>AFTER you come from under the Gateway of the <HI>Magazine,</HI> there is an <HI>open</HI> on the Bridge on either Side. Over the one of these it was that surpri∣zing Accident happened to Mr. <HI>Anderson,</HI> a Merchant and Alderman this
<PB N="132" REF="143"/>
Town: As he was looking over the Bridge talking with a Friend, he finger'd a Ring he had on (as People frequently do when they are thoughtful) which before he was aware, fell into the River, and was given entirely over for lost. Sometime after one of his Servants having bought a Salmon in the Market, found the very Ring in the Belly of the Fish, and restored it to his Master. <HI>Herodotus</HI> gives the like Account in the 3d Book of <HI>Polycrates</HI> King of <HI>Samos,</HI> who was at that Time esteem'd one of the Favourites of Fortune, which as my Authority observes, may satisfy us of the Truth of <HI>Solomon</HI>'s saying, <HI>There is no new Thing under the Sun.</HI></P>
<P>THIS Gentleman was Mayor of <HI>Newcastle,</HI> and was Ancestor of the present Mr. <HI>Abraham Anderson</HI> Merchant, on the <HI>Sandhill.</HI> The said <HI>Fran∣cis Anderson</HI> made his Estate to his Son <HI>Henry Anderson,</HI> who was the Father of the said <HI>Abraham</HI>'s Grandfather. The Estate and Ring have been in the Family ever since, and are now in the Possession of the said <HI>Abraham.</HI> I my self saw this <HI>Ring</HI> about 4 Months ago. The Impression the Seal gives is that of <HI>Soloman</HI> and the Queen of <HI>Sheba.</HI> On the Inside of the Ring, just under the Signet, is the Picture of a <HI>Salmon,</HI> in Commemoration of the Fish and the Transaction, on the one Side of which is the Letter <HI>F,</HI> and on the other the Letter <HI>R,</HI> in Commemoration of the <HI>Person.</HI> It is a Curiosity so great, that not only the whole Kingdom can't show the like of it; but the whole World beside, nay the World itself never, that we know of, had the like Transaction but once before, <HI>viz.</HI> that before-mentioned. The Gentleman therefore who has this valuable Jewel in his Possession, ought to have the ut∣most Care of it upon many Accounts, and as none of the least, that it is a Credit to his Family, as well as to the Town.</P>
<P>A little further, about the middle of the Bridge is a large old Tower, which they call the Tower of the Bridge, where leud and disorderly Persons are kept 'till they are examined by the Mayor, and brought to due Punishment, ex∣cept the Crime be of a very gross Nature, and then are removed to <HI>Newgate</HI> and there continue 'till the Assizes. Beyond this a little is the <HI>Blue-Stone,</HI> which gives the Name of the <HI>Blue-Stone</HI> to that Part of the Bridge. Here is the Bounds of <HI>Newcastle</HI> Southwards. Beyond this, the other Part of the Bridge belongs to the County Palatine of <HI>Durham,</HI> and is repaired by the <HI>Bishop.</HI> At the End of the Bridge, which leads into <HI>Gateside,</HI> is another <HI>Tower,</HI> where has been a <HI>Draw-bridge.</HI></P>

<P>ABOVE when I mentioned the <HI>Sandhill,</HI> I took Notice, that on the East it leads to the <HI>Key-side,</HI> which is a long <HI>Wharf</HI> or <HI>Key</HI> for Ships and other Vessels. It is built upon the <HI>Sand,</HI> as indeed all the lower Parts of the Town have been. Through this Street goes the remaining Part of the <HI>Town-wall,</HI> which is continued from the East-end of the <HI>Merchants Court</HI> to <HI>Sand∣gate Gate,</HI> which make in some Manner <HI>two Streets,</HI> the Inside and Outside of the <HI>Key.</HI> On the Top of this <HI>Wall</HI> is a <HI>Walk</HI> along it, as is along the <HI>other Walls</HI> of the <HI>Town;</HI> and at the Bottom of it are a great many <HI>Gates,</HI> which are called <HI>Water-gates.</HI> These in the Reign of King <HI>James</HI> I. <HI>Anno</HI> 1616, were ordered to be locked up every Night, except one or two to stand open, for the Masters and Seamen to go to and fro to their Ships. This was done, to prevent Servants casting Ashes and other Rubbish into the River; and those two Gates were watched all Night long.</P>
<P><PB N="133" REF="144"/>THIS Key extends in Length from East to West 103 Rods.</P>
<P>THIS Street is chiefly inhabited by such as have their Living by Shipping, such as Merchants, <HI>Hostmen, Brewars,</HI> &amp;c. As it is the great Place of Re∣sort for the Business of the <HI>Coal-trade</HI> (the grand Support of this Town and Country, and many other Places also) and likewise for many other Things; it is not much to be wondred at, if in going along it, you see almost, no∣thing but a whole Street of Sign-posts of Taverns, Ale-houses, Coffee-houses, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>AFTER you pass the <HI>Custom-house,</HI> where the King's Customs are received, which is at the <HI>West-end</HI> of this Street, as you go along eastward, you meet with a great many narrow <HI>Chairs</HI> or <HI>Lanes.</HI> These have so many Times changed their Names, and in all Probability will so often do it, that it is to little Purpose at present to mention them. There is however <HI>Grundon-Chair,</HI> which I meet with in a Writing of several hundred Years old; as also the Name of the <HI>Broad Chair,</HI> of a very ancient Standing, and the Name of ano∣ther in a Writing, drawn in the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> VI. which, had it been worth remembring, would in all Probability have been forgot long before now. But which of the others went formerly by the Names of <HI>Brown-Chair,</HI> the Chair of <HI>Nicholas de Salicibus, Tod's Chair, Norham Chair, Philip's Chair, Shipman Chair, Oliver Chair, Galway Chair,</HI> we are altogether in the dark. There is one more ancient Name of a <HI>Chair</HI> in this Street, which is the <HI>Kirk-Chair,</HI> or the Way or Lane they generally went to Church by from the <HI>Key∣side.</HI> This I take to be that Chair, which now goes by the Name of <HI>Fen∣wick</HI>'s Entry, because its Situation answers so exactly to the <HI>Church-yard,</HI> the Top of this Chair being almost upon a Line with the Stairs that lead up to the Church. This Lane is much the neatest of the whole Street, having in it several <HI>good Houses,</HI> which are kept in a different Order from the Generality of the House in those narrow Lanes. In the upper Part of it is the Dwel∣ling-house of <HI>Cuthbert Fenwick,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> Alderman of this Town, who is the Proprietor of the whole Entry.</P>
<P>AT the <HI>Key</HI> itself is a very safe Station for Ships, where they lye free and secure from the greatest Dangers of Wind and Water, where they unload their Wares and Commodities, their <HI>Wood, Deal;</HI> and by a <HI>Crane,</HI> their <HI>Wines, Flax,</HI> and all heavier Commodities.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XI. <HI>Of</HI> Pandon <HI>or</HI> Pampedon.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">H</SEG>AVING done with what was anciently called <HI>Newcastle,</HI> we come now to describe the ancient Town of <HI>Pampedon,</HI> which was a Town of itself distinct from <HI>Newcastle;</HI> but was united to it in the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> I. <HI>Vide anno</HI> 1299. There is some Doubt about the Reason of the Name, some imagining it came from <HI>Pandana,</HI> one of the Gates of <HI>Rome,</HI> which was so called, <HI>quia semper paterit,</HI> because <HI>it stood always open.</HI> But I dare say, this could ne∣ver give Name to the Town of <HI>Pandon,</HI> which being in all Probability a <HI>Roman</HI> Place of Defence, was rather obliged to be always shut. Others imagine it came from <HI>Pandara,</HI> a <HI>Scottish Virgin Saint;</HI> but for what Reason they know best. For my Part I never saw one yet; and perhaps for good Reason. For if I mistake not, this Town had the Name of <HI>Pandon,</HI> before there ever was <HI>a Saint in that Kingdom.</HI> I am therefore in∣clinable to believe, that it got its Name from the <HI>Romans</HI> who lived in it, who, as <HI>Grey</HI> agrees, called it <HI>Pampedon</HI> or <HI>Pantheon,</HI> because perhaps some Building was erected here in this Place, in Imitation of the <HI>Pantheon</HI> at <HI>Rome</HI> (this Wall being the utmost Confines of the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire) which was built in Honour of all the Gods. And as this Wall was the utmost Bounds of the <HI>Roman Empire,</HI> therefore there might be such a <HI>Temple</HI> in this Place, to remind the <HI>Romans</HI> of the necessary Assistance of all the Gods, to preserve the Bounds of the <HI>Roman Empire.</HI> The late <NOTE N="l" PLACE="marg">Rom. Brit. <HI>p.</HI> 131.</NOTE> Mr. <HI>Horsley</HI> will have the latter Syllable of this Word to come from the Word <HI>Deen,</HI> which signifies a <HI>Hollow,</HI> or a <HI>Brook,</HI> because such is the Place. But with this I cannot agree; the <HI>Deen</HI> could not have that Weight with it, as to give Name to the whole Place; or should that be allowed, how is the former Part of the Name accounted for? It retains therefore (as <HI>Grey</HI> justly observes) its Name, without much Alteration, since the <HI>Romans</HI> resided in it. After the Departure of the Ro∣mans, as the same Authority gives out, the Kings of <HI>Northumberland</HI> kept their Residence in it, and had their House now called <HI>Pandon-Hall.</HI> It was a safe Bulwark, having the <HI>Picls Wall</HI> on the North-side, and the River <HI>Time</HI> on the South. This Place of <HI>Pandon</HI> is of such Antiquity, that if a Man would express an ancient Thing, it is a common <HI>Proverb, As old as</HI> Pandon-<HI>Gate.</HI> Thus far this Author.</P>

<HEAD>Sect. I. <HI>Of the</HI> MANOUR-CHARE.</HEAD>
<P>BUT to treat of some Particulars of this ancient Town, we shall begin then at the <HI>Manour-Chare,</HI> which leads from <HI>Pilgrim-street</HI> to St. <HI>Austin Fryers.</HI> This Chare which leads from <HI>Pilgrim-street</HI> to <HI>Jesus Hospital,</HI> and from thence to the Head of the <HI>Broad-Chare,</HI> was in ancient Times called <HI>Cowgate.</HI> This is plain from an ancient Writing in the Possession of Mr. <HI>Tho∣mas Waters,</HI> in <HI>Pilgrim-street,</HI> dated <HI>Feb.</HI> 20, in the 5th Year of <HI>Edward</HI> the 4th, where are these Words, describing the Situation of the House he pos∣sesses at present: <HI>Prout jacet in vico Peregrinorum infra villam Novicastri super Tynam inter Tenementum nuper Laurentii de Acton ex parte Boreali, &amp; Tenementum nuper Thomae Clerk, ex parte Australi, &amp; extendit in Longitudine a via Regia ante, usque vicum quondam vocatum</HI> Cowgate, <HI>modo vocatum</HI> Austyn-Chare, <HI>retro.</HI> In the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the 4th it had the Name of <HI>Austyn-Chare,</HI> as appears al∣so from this Writing: Now it has the Name of <HI>Manour-Chare</HI> which some imagine to be given from the Word Minor or Minorites, or Franciscans; but unless they can prove that the <HI>Fryery</HI> of the <HI>Franciscans</HI> was situated here, they never can prove that the Chare was so called from them; and this is scarce possible to be done. For we have already shewn that the <HI>Minorites</HI> or <HI>Franciscans</HI> had their House in another Part of the Town, <HI>viz.</HI> in the <HI>High-Fryar-Chare;</HI> this is also clearly proved from the several Writings of the Com∣pany of Taylors, that this Place was formerly called <HI>Cowgate,</HI> and afterwards called the <HI>Frear-Chare,</HI> or St. <HI>Austin Frear-Chare.</HI> These Writings of theirs also mention an Alms-house, which went by the Name of <HI>Ward</HI>'s Alms-house, situated in this Chare, I supposed it was situated at the Bottom of Mr. <HI>Wa∣ter</HI>'s Garden, for I have heard some old People say, they remember thereabouts the Ruins of an Alms-house.</P>
<P><HI>Cowgate</HI> the ancient Name of the Street, is still continued in one Part of it, <HI>viz.</HI> from the Foot of <HI>Silver-street,</HI> to the Head of the <HI>Broad-Chare.</HI></P>
<P>HAVING come down this Lane from <HI>Pilgrim-street,</HI> we come to three different Ways; that on the Right leads down into <HI>Pandon;</HI> that on the Front leads into the <HI>Town</HI>'s <HI>Hospital;</HI> and that on the Left, into St. <HI>Austin-Fryers,</HI> and <HI>Carliol-Croft.</HI></P>

<P>THE left-hand Passage has still the Remains of a large Gate, which has been one of the Gates leading to St. <HI>Austin-Fryers,</HI> which, (having past this Gate) is a little above upon the Right Hand. There is still a compleat Quadrangle, to be seen, the South-side of which has undoubtedly been the Chapel. This seems to have been the ancient Building, for <HI>Grey</HI> seems to

speak of some sumptuous Additions that were made to it. In succeeding A∣ges, says he, it was inlarged and beautified with stately Buildings, Cloysters, and a Fair Church. The Kings of <HI>England</HI> since the Conquest, kept House in it, whence they came with an Army Royal against <HI>Scotland;</HI> and since the Suppression of Monasteries, made a Magazine and Store-house for the North Parts. Now of late that Princely Fabrick is demolished, and laid level with the Ground. The Pride, Covetousness, Luxury and Idolatry of these Hou∣ses brought a sudden Ruin upon themselves and Houses.</P>
<P>THE same Authority tells us also, that there was an antient Religious House founded by the Kings of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> and that several of them were bu∣ried here; but it cannot be true that they built any Thing for the St. <HI>Au∣stin</HI> Fryers, for they came not into <HI>England</HI> 'till long after the Conquest, in the Year 1252. Then it was that <HI>Lanfrank</HI> of <HI>Milan,</HI> the first General of the <HI>Eremites</HI> of St. <HI>Austin,</HI> sent some of them into <HI>England</HI> to seek a Dwelling for themselves. The <HI>Augustin</HI> Fryers held their first House given them in <HI>Wales,</HI> at a Place called <HI>Wood-house</HI> which before had belonged to the Family of the noble Family of the <HI>Turburvills.</HI> Afterward <HI>Humphry Bohun,</HI> Earl of <HI>Here∣ford</HI> and <HI>Essex,</HI> in the Year of our Lord 1253, gave them a House and beau∣tiful Church, remarkable for a Spire of wonderful Workmanship, in <HI>Lon∣don;</HI> which is now partly a Meeting-house for the German Protestants who have settled in <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Anno</HI> 1377, the <HI>Augustin</HI> Fryers obtained Leave to eat Flesh, upon Condi∣tion that they should keep the Fast of the Fryers Minors before Christmas. <HI>Stephen. ad. Vol.</HI> 2d. 221.</P>
<P>WHAT Year this House was founded in, or this Order came to this House, I have no where met with, but the <HI>Augustines</HI> are said to have been founded by the Lord <HI>Ross,</HI> <NOTE N="m" PLACE="marg">De rebus Novocast'.</NOTE> the Baron of <HI>Werk,</HI> which I am inclinable to believe very true, for in the 11th of <HI>Edward</HI> the Second, 1317. I find mention made of some Lands in <HI>Cowgate,</HI> belonging to the Brethren of St. <HI>Austin,</HI> which were given them by <HI>William Ross</HI> who was Baron of <HI>Werk.</HI> How much earlier than this King's Reign this Monastery was founded, I have not been able to learn. But it's probable it was sometime in the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the 1st, and this I think is out of Dispute now, for since this Conjecture of my own, I received a Letter from the Rev. Mr. <HI>Wearing,</HI> of <HI>Bampton</HI> in <HI>Westmoreland,</HI> with the following <HI>Account.</HI> King <HI>Edward</HI> the First, in the 19th Year of his Reign, gave Leave to one <HI>John de Capella,</HI> to give and assign a Messuage of his in <HI>Penrith,</HI> to the Prior and Fryers of the Order of St. <HI>Augustine,</HI> in the Town of <HI>Newcastle</HI> upon <HI>Tyne.</HI></P>
<P>THEY surrendred on the 9th of <HI>Jan.</HI> 30 <HI>Hen.</HI> 8.</P>
<P>THE inclosed Ground all round it, where is now the Pasture of <HI>Nathaniel Clayton,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> Alderman, the Surgeons-Hall, the Hospitals, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> did undoubt∣edly belong to them, and were their Gardens.</P>
<P>THIS House is now turned partly into a Work-house, for the Employment of the Poor; Part of it is turned into a House of Correction, a Dunghill, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Here is the Charity-School of the Parish of <HI>All Hallows,</HI> which was built <HI>Anno</HI> 1723, and an House for the Master to live in, which was built the same Year.</P>
<P>THE Bells of <HI>All Hallows</HI> were cast in this Place, which since the Decay of the <HI>Monastery,</HI> was called rhe <HI>Artillery-yard,</HI> from the Townsmens perform∣ing there the Exercise of the <HI>Pike</HI> and <HI>Gun.</HI></P>
<P>BEFORE I have done with this Monastery, it may not be amiss to men∣tion a Passage in <HI>Milbank</HI>'s Manuscript, which came to my Hands since the compiling of this Antiquity. The Author of it says, "When I was young,
<PB N="137" REF="148"/>
(which was, as I take it, about the First of King <HI>James</HI> I. Reign) <Q>there were <HI>Cloysters</HI> in this Monastery, and a <HI>fair Church.</HI> A <HI>Scot</HI> did beg it of King <HI>James;</HI> after that took the <HI>Lead</HI> off it and sold it; but it was cast a∣way before it came to its Market. He sold also some <HI>Stones</HI> to Sir <HI>Peter Riddel,</HI> who with them built the South-End of his fine House; but now it belongs to Captain <HI>Dykes,</HI> and his Posterity hath no right.</Q></P>

<P>HAVING thus done with what relates to the Passage above mentioned on the <HI>left Hand,</HI> let us enter that on the <HI>Front.</HI> And this is what the People call the <HI>Town's Hospital,</HI> but its true Name is <HI>Jesus Hospital,</HI> for it was dedicated to the <HI>Holy Jesus.</HI> You ascend to it by Stairs from the high Street, and then enter into a <HI>pleasing Field,</HI> on the North-side of which is the <HI>said Hospital.</HI> It is three Story high, and the Under-story is adorned with Piazza's, which are about 60 Yards in Length, and make a very agreeable Walk. About the Middle of the Piazza's is the Entrance into the second and third Stories; and over against this Entrance is a Fountain (very much beautified) for the Use of the <HI>Hospital.</HI></P>
<P>THIS <HI>new Hospital,</HI> commonly called the <HI>Town's Hospital</HI> in the Manours, dedicated to the <HI>Holy Jesus,</HI> was founded, erected, and endowed, at the Charge of this <HI>Corporation</HI><NOTE N="n" PLACE="marg">Anno 1681, T.

<P>THE Town allows them quarterly 20 <HI>s.</HI> and the Master 30 <HI>s.</HI></P>
<P>TOWARDS the Bottom of this Field is <HI>another Hospital,</HI> erected for six poor Widows of <HI>Clergymen</HI> and <HI>Merchants,</HI> which was endowed by the Cha∣rity of Mrs. <HI>Anne Davison,</HI> Widow of Mr. <HI>Benjamin Davison,</HI> Merchant, and erected by the Corporation of <HI>Newcastle, Nathaniel Clayton,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> Mayor, <HI>Thomas Wasse,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> Sheriff, <HI>Anno</HI> 1725.</P>
<P>THEY have to subsist on 40 <HI>s. per</HI> Quarter each.</P>

<P>ON the East of this same Field is the Hall of the <HI>Barber-Surgeons,</HI> which was rebuilt by them in the Year 1730.</P>
<P>IT is a very beautiful one, and not a little sumptuous; it stands upon tall <HI>Piazza's,</HI> under which is a very spacious Walk. There is before it a fine Square, divided into four Areas or Grass-Plats, surrounded with Gravel-Walks, each of which is adorned with a Statue. The First of the two next the

Hall is the Figure of <HI>Aesculapius</HI> placed upon a tall Pedestal, upon one Side of which is the Motto <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. In the Area, oppposite to this, is the Figure of <HI>Hippocrates,</HI> who bears an open Book, with these Words in it <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, and on the one Side of the Pedestal <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, These were set up in the Year 1710, <HI>John Shaw</HI> and <HI>Robert Golightly</HI> Stewards.</P>
<P>ON the other two Grass-Platts are the Figures of <HI>Medicus Pergameus</HI> or <HI>Galen,</HI> and <HI>Medicus Spagyricus</HI> or <HI>Paracelsus,</HI> which were erected 1712, <HI>Robert Golightly</HI> and <HI>William Handby</HI> Stewards. I am inform'd by one of this Com∣pany, that in a little Time, the Wall at the Foot of the Garden will be taken away, and instead thereof will be Iron-Rails. It will shew the Hall and Gardens to some Advantage, but be rather too great an Ornament for such a dirty Part of the Town.</P>
<P>THERE are besides this Square two other Gardens for Herbs, which to∣gether with the <HI>Hall</HI> and <HI>Garden</HI> we have been speaking of, are attended by a Gardner, who lives there for that Purpose.</P>

<HEAD><HI>Sect. V.</HI> Of <HI>WARD</HI>'s Alms-house, <HI>ALVEY</HI>'s Island, <HI>PANDON</HI> Hall.</HEAD>
<P>WE now turn to the right Hand, and descend the Chair towards <HI>Pan∣don,</HI> and pass by Mr. <HI>Waters</HI>'s Garden, at the End of which was <HI>Ward</HI>'s Alms-house, above mentioned, of which I have lately met with the following Account from the <HI>Milbank</HI> Manuscript. <Q>The chief <HI>Alms-house</HI> in the Town is the <HI>Ward</HI>'s, near the <HI>Manour;</HI> the <HI>Mills</HI> at <HI>Pandon-gate</HI> should give them, as I remember, 20 <HI>s. per annum,</HI> to buy them <HI>Coals;</HI> but old Mr. <HI>Brandling</HI> pulled off the Lead, on purpose to expel the poor People, which he did. The <HI>Mills</HI> are now fallen into one <HI>Homers</HI>'s Hand, and so is lost for ever. I have seen the Writings, and know it.</Q> Below this is a narrow Passage which leads into the <HI>Carliol Croft.</HI> Below this again is a Place, which was formerly called the <HI>Island,</HI> as says Tradition. It was so called, because in former Times, when the Tide flow'd up to the <HI>Stock-bridge,</HI> there was thereabout a <HI>Hill of Sand,</HI> which at the Tide's leav∣ing of it, appeared like an Island. They call it at present <HI>Alvey</HI>'s Island, be∣cause it belong'd to one of that Name. It is the very Place, on which stands the <HI>House, Cellars,</HI> and <HI>Malting</HI> of Mr. <HI>George Hinkster,</HI> which are bounded on the West, North and South by the King's Street, and on the East by a waste Piece of Ground, of the Lady <HI>Goldsburgh,</HI> which was formerly called <HI>the Stones.</HI></P>
<P>OPPOSITE to the South Front of this House was the ancient Building, <HI>viz. Pandon-hall,</HI> above mentioned, but now rebuilt in some Measure. There are still remaining many ancient Walls and Parts of this Building; it was of con∣siderable Bigness, having been according to Tradition, on its North-front in Length from the <HI>Stockbridge</HI> to <HI>Cowgate;</HI> and on its West-front in Length from its <HI>North-west Corner,</HI> beyond that Lane that leads into <HI>Blyth's Nook.</HI></P>
<P>IT is of great Antiquity, being built in the Times of the <HI>Heptarchy;</HI> for it was the House of the Kings of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> who liv'd in it, for which Reason it was call'd <HI>Pandon-hall.</HI></P>

<HEAD>Sect. VI. <HI>Of</HI> FISHERGATE <HI>and</HI> WALL-KNOWL.</HEAD>
<P>FROM hence we go Eastward unto <HI>Pandon-Bridge,</HI> which is called the <HI>Stock-Bridge.</HI> It was undoubtedly of Wood in ancient Times, tho' we meet with an Account of its being Stone, when <HI>Thomas de Carliol</HI> was Mayor, which was in <HI>Edward</HI> I. Time at latest. To this Place it was that the <HI>Fishermen</HI> brought up their Fish, and sold them here, as <HI>Grey</HI> observes from Tradition. But to confirm this beyond the Force of Tradition; it must cer∣tainly have been true, that the <HI>Fish-market</HI> was here, because the Street you go into when you have past <HI>Pandon-Bridge,</HI> was formerly called <HI>Fisher-gate.</HI> Now this is plain from an ancient Writing, which was drawn when <HI>Henry le Scot</HI> was Mayor of this Town, about the Year 1287. I shall give my Au∣thority at large, because there depends upon it some other Things besides this.</P>
<P>THE Writing is a Conveyance of some Land which is thus described.</P>
<P><HI>QUAE extendit in longitudine à communi via super le Wall-Knoll, in australem. Partem domûs Fratrum de monte Carmel, usque ad communem viam quae solebat du∣cere versus</HI> Fishergate, <HI>i. e.</HI></P>
<P>WHICH Land extends itself from the Street of the <HI>Wall-Knoll,</HI> to the South-side of the Monastery of the <HI>Carmelites,</HI> even to the High-way, which formerly led to <HI>Fishergate.</HI></P>
<P>NOW it is certain, this Monastery was at the Top of the <HI>Wall-Knoll;</HI> the Remains of it are still in Being, and shall be by and by further consider'd. It is also certain from this ancient Writing, that a Way led from the <HI>South-side</HI> of the said <HI>Monastery</HI> to <HI>Fishergate;</HI> therefore this Street must be <HI>Fishergate,</HI> because the common Way here spoken of could lead to no other Place. I take this common Way to have been those <HI>Stairs</HI> beside Mr. <HI>Green</HI>'s House at the <HI>Stockbridge,</HI> which lead up to the <HI>Gardens</HI> there, and which, were it not a <HI>Wall,</HI> would lead directly from this Street to the Remains of this <HI>Mo∣nastery.</HI></P>
<P>AS we go along from the <HI>Stockbridge,</HI> we meet two Streets, one on the left Hand, and the other on the right. That on the left Hand is called the <HI>Wall-Knoll,</HI> which, as it is a very great Ascent and high Hill from <HI>Fishergate,</HI> so it seems to me to have this Name from the <HI>Roman Wall</HI> going along it; for the Word <HI>Knoll</HI> signifies an <HI>Hill</HI> or <HI>Eminence,</HI> as I gather from the Lord Bishop of <HI>London</HI>'s Note in <HI>Cambden</HI> upon <HI>Sevenoke</HI> in <HI>Kent,</HI> who says, On the East-side of it standeth <HI>Knowll,</HI> so called, because it is seated upon a <HI>Hill.</HI> And <HI>Grey</HI> says also positively, that it was Part of the <HI>Picts</HI> Wall.</P>
<P>AT the upper End of the Street above mentioned, towards the <HI>Carpenters</HI> <NOTE N="o" PLACE="marg"><P><HI>The fol∣lowing Play coming too late to my Hands to be inserted in its proper Place, I am obliged to mention it here. It is intituled,</HI></P>

<P>IT is said by <HI>Dugdale</HI> in his Baron. <HI>Lumley,</HI> that the <HI>Roger Thornton</HI> he is there speaking of, was the Founder of the House of the <HI>White Fryars</HI> in <HI>New∣castle.</HI> But this <HI>Roger</HI> can scarce be the Founder of it, for I have proved him to be the younger <HI>Roger;</HI> and it was taken Notice of above, that <HI>Roger</HI> the Elder left Two Fother of Lead to it when he died, so that if either of them be the Founder, it must be the Elder, rather than the Younger that <HI>Dugdale</HI> speaks of.</P>
<P>BUT I believe it will be a difficult Matter, upon Examination, to prove either the Father or the Son the Founder of it, for it boasts a greater Anti∣quity: For this <HI>Domus Fratrum de Monte Carmel,</HI> is mentioned in an ancient Writing which was drawn when <HI>Henry le Scot</HI> was Mayor, about the Year 1287, in the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the 1st, as is said above, and therefore it must at that Time have been in being; but the Elder of them was not Mayor of <HI>Newcastle,</HI> 'till 114 Years after this; so that it is impossible he should be the Founder, and therefore much less his Son. They might, and probably they

both of them were <HI>great Benefactors,</HI> or <HI>second Founders</HI> to it, and so have been esteemed each of them <HI>Founders</HI> themselves.</P>

<HEAD>Sect. VIII. <HI>Of</HI> CROSSWELL-GATE, BYKER-CHARE.</HEAD>
<P>ABOVE when we went from <HI>Fishergate-street,</HI> we met two Streets, that on the Left Hand we have already treated of: The other, I imagine, is that which formerly went by the Name of <HI>Crosswell-gate,</HI> which is often mentioned in ancient Writings. It is reported that the Dwelling-house of <HI>Roger Thornton</HI> was in this Street. Whatever Truth is in this, it is certain, that many Houses in this Street pay an Annual Rent to the Lord <HI>Scarborough</HI> to this Day, into whose Family the Grand-daughter of <HI>Roger Thornton</HI> was mar∣ryed. There are in this Street several <HI>Lanes</HI> or <HI>Allies,</HI> the first we meet with in going along from <HI>Fishergate,</HI> is a Place called, at present, <HI>Blyth</HI>'s <HI>Nook:</HI> It is built over <HI>Pandon Burne.</HI> The next is a narrow Lane leading to the <HI>Burne Bank,</HI> a Place by which <HI>Pandon Burne</HI> runs into the <HI>Tyne.</HI> It lies very low, and before the Heightning of the Ground with Ballast, and the Building of the <HI>Wall</HI> and <HI>Key,</HI> was often of great Hazard to the Inhabitants; once in particular a most melancholy accident happen'd in this Place, in the Year 1320, the 13th of <HI>Edward</HI> the 3d, the <HI>River</HI> of <HI>Tyne</HI> over-flowed so much, that 120 <HI>Laymen,</HI> and several <HI>Priests,</HI> besides Women, were drowned; and as <HI>Grey</HI> says, 140 Houses were destroyed. <HI>Compleat Hist. Eng. Vol. 1st. P. 235.</HI></P>
<P>BEYOND this again is a Chare called <HI>Byker Chare,</HI> which seems by the a∣ged Look of several of the Buildings, those especially at the <HI>North-end</HI> of the Chare, where is the House of Mr. <HI>Henry Atkinson,</HI> Hoastman, to be of great Antiquity: Perhaps it got the Name of <HI>Byker-Chare,</HI> from one <HI>Robert

de Byker</HI> and <HI>Laderine,</HI> his Wife, who had Lands in <HI>Pandon, &amp;c.</HI> See <HI>Anno</HI> 1299.</P>
<P>BEYOND this again is <HI>Cocks Chare, Love-lane,</HI> &amp;c. where are some Houses which deserve a better Situation.</P>

<HEAD>Sect. IX. COWGATE, TRINITY-HOUSE, BROAD-CHARE.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN we came to <HI>Pandon-Hall,</HI> we went Eastward into <HI>Pandon;</HI> it remains now, that we go Southward from the same Place. Leaving then <HI>Silver-street</HI> on the Right Hand, we come into <HI>Cowgate,</HI> which has been a Part of the Town where some eminent Men have lived in; such as <HI>Gilbert de Cowgate, Walter de Cowgate,</HI> &amp;c. who were Men of Fortune and Estate. Going forward, we pass by <HI>Blythe Nook</HI> on the Left Hand, and the <HI>Dog-Bank</HI> on the Right, and then we come to the <HI>Broad Chare;</HI> a little below the En∣trance of which, is the <HI>Trinity House;</HI> which according to some was a <HI>Mo∣nastry,</HI> dedicated to the <HI>Holy Trinity.</HI> This Order of the <HI>Trinity House</HI> was founded by St. <HI>John de Matha</HI> and St. <HI>John de Valois,</HI> in the Year 1198, in the Popedom of <HI>Innocent</HI> III. The End of its Institution was the Redemp∣tion of Captives. In the Year 1224, a Monastry was founded for this Order in <HI>Kent.</HI> What Time this Monastry of the <HI>Trinity</HI> (if there was such a one) was founded in this Town, we are intirely in the Dark: Only it was said by some, that <HI>Laurentius</HI> of <HI>Newcastle,</HI> was its Founder. If this be true, it is not improbable but it was <HI>Laurentius Acton,</HI> who was Mayor of this Town in 1435 and 1436, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>WE are also equally at a loss as to its Situation: For Bishop <HI>Burnet,</HI> in his Collection of Records, <HI>P.</HI> 146, says, It was on the <HI>Wall-knoll,</HI> in <HI>Newcastle;</HI> and that they surrender'd <HI>January</HI> 10th, 30th of <HI>Henry</HI> the 8th. If it was here, I know of no Place to fix it in, but where the <HI>Carmelites</HI> were, and this could never be. I am therefore inclinable to believe, that this Monastry means that of the <HI>Carmelites,</HI> and through a Mistake is called that of the <HI>Trinity.</HI></P>
<P>BUT be that as it will, it is certain that this Place called the <HI>Trinity House,</HI> was no <HI>Religious House:</HI> For it is said in our Account below, to have been called of old Time <HI>Dalton</HI>'s <HI>Place.</HI> And besides, had it been this <HI>Religious House,</HI> the Mariners could not have got Possession of it 'till its Suppression, which was on the 10th of <HI>January,</HI> 30th of <HI>Henry</HI> the 8th; whereas it was conveyed to them the 20th of <HI>Henry</HI> the 7th, as the following Account testi∣fies.</P>
<P>A Writing in the Custody of the Brethren of the <HI>Trinity-House,</HI> dated the 4th Day of <HI>January,</HI> the 20th of the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the 7th, which gives an Account of a Messuage and Garden, which was convey'd by one <HI>Ralph Heb∣borne,</HI> of <HI>Hebborne,</HI> of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> to the Fraternity of the Mariners. It is the Place where is now the <HI>Trinity House,</HI> which was in old Time called <HI>Dalton</HI>'s <HI>Place.</HI></P>
<P>IN the same Writing it is order'd, that the aforesaid Messuage, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> shall be repair'd for Ever by the common Purse of the Brotherhood; that in some convenient Part of it should be an <HI>Hall</HI> for the <HI>Fellowship</HI> to meet in, at all
<PB N="144" REF="155"/>
Times convenient, for the observing of their Rules, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and that in the Re∣sidue of the same, there should be certain Lodgings order'd for such of the said <HI>Fellowship,</HI> as afterwards should fall into Poverty, or be not able to sustain themselves: Those they held during the Term of their Lives, and then were succeeded by others in the like necessitous Circumstances. It was also order∣ed in this Writing, that within the said Messuage, there should be a Chappel and a Priest, to sing and say Mass, and other Divine Service therein, as should be appointed by the Aldermen, and Wardens of the said <HI>Fraternity,</HI> for the Time being. That the Priest and the said poor Persons so admitted, should pray for the good Estate of the said <HI>Ralph Hebborne,</HI> Master <HI>John Hebborne, George Hebborne,</HI> and for the Masters Souls, and for the good Estate of the said <HI>Fellowship,</HI> and for the Souls of such of the same <HI>Fellowship</HI> as be depar∣ted, or hereafter should depart to the Mercy of God; and also for the Souls of <HI>John Dalton,</HI> sometime Owner of the said Messuage, his Ancestors Souls, and all Christian Souls.</P>
<P>ONE Part of this Writing was to be put in a Chest, belonging to the <HI>Fellowship,</HI> and kept by them; the other was to be kept in a Chest for that purpose, in the Vestry of <HI>All-Hallows</HI> in this Town, in the Custody of the Church-Wardens, for the Time being, for Ever.</P>
<P>THIS was further confirm'd to the <HI>Fraternity</HI> of the <HI>Trinity House,</HI> by <HI>Tho∣mas Hebborne,</HI> Son of the said <HI>Ralph Hebborne,</HI> on the 9th of <HI>September,</HI> in the 16th of the Reign of King <HI>Henry</HI> the 8th, upon the Conditions following, <HI>viz.</HI> That the <HI>Fellowship</HI> should pay to the said <HI>Thomas Hebborne,</HI> his Heirs or Assigns, within the Town of <HI>Newcastle,</HI> on the Vigil of the Apostles, <HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>Paul,</HI> in the Month of <HI>June, a Pottle of Wine,</HI> if it be demanded yearly, for Evermore. That the said <HI>Thomas Hebborne</HI> should be made a Brother of the <HI>Fraternity,</HI> and Partaker of all Masses, good Prayers and Suffrage, which should afterwards be celebrated, said and done by the Chaplain and Priest of the <HI>Fraternity,</HI> within the <HI>Trinity House,</HI> and at the <HI>Trinity</HI> Altar within the Church of <HI>All-Hallows,</HI> for Evermore; with such Obsequies and Funeral Ce∣remonies, as usually were done at the Burial of any Brother of the same <HI>Fra∣ternity,</HI> if the said <HI>Thomas</HI> departs within this Town of <HI>Newcastle.</HI> The Priest of the <HI>Trinity House</HI> at this Time, was one Sir <HI>Robert Ellison.</HI></P>
<P>TO this Writing was annex'd the Seal of the Town of <HI>Newcastle,</HI> and the Names of the Mayor, Sheriff, and Aldermen.</P>
<P><NOTE N="r" PLACE="marg">On <HI>Oct.</HI> the 5th, <HI>28 Hen. 8.</HI> Light-houses were permitted to be built by the <HI>Trinity-house,</HI> to found, edify, make and build <HI>two Towers;</HI> that is to say, one on the North Part of <HI>Shields,</HI> in the Entrance of the Har∣bour, and a∣nother upon the Hill.</NOTE>KING <HI>James</HI> the 1st, in the third Year of his Reign, granted to the <HI>Ma∣ster, Pylots,</HI> and <HI>Seamen</HI> of <HI>Newcastle,</HI> a Charter.</P>

<P>IN a Manuscript I have frequently mentioned, it is said that the <HI>Trinity House</HI> in the <HI>Broad Chare,</HI> was held by the <HI>Masters</HI> and <HI>Mariners</HI> of this Town of the <HI>Andersons,</HI> by giving them a red Rose at <HI>Christmas,</HI> which <HI>Bartram Anderson</HI> turned to Wine, and then sold it to Sir <HI>Ralph Jenison,</HI> and it adds, how they agree I know not.

<P>LEAVING this House of the <HI>Marriners,</HI> we go down the <HI>Broad Chare,</HI> without any Thing remarkable, 'till you come to the <HI>Key-side;</HI> about the Middle of it is a <HI>Square,</HI> which goes by the Name of <HI>Stony-hill,</HI> nigh it a Lane, called <HI>Spicer-lane,</HI> which also leads on to the <HI>Key.</HI></P>

<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Sect. I. <HI>Of the</HI> FORTH.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">W</SEG>ITHOUT the <HI>Close-Gate</HI> is a pretty long Street, with Houses on each Side; which goes as far as a <HI>Dike</HI> called <HI>Skinner-Bourne,</HI> where are of late Years a Factory belonging to Mr. <HI>Thomlinson,</HI> a Pot-House to Mr. <HI>Joseph Blenkinsop</HI> and <HI>Ralph Harl,</HI> and a Glass-House to Mr. <HI>Dagney,</HI> and Company; from thence Northward at the Top of the Hill is the Place called the <HI>Forth,</HI> anciently called the <HI>Frith,</HI> which lies without the Walls of the Town, and abutts on the South on a certain little Close called <HI>Goose-green-Close,</HI> then it extends it∣self to a Close called <HI>Dove-cote-Close,</HI> and from thence Westward by the fur∣thest Ditch of the <HI>Close,</HI> which lies contiguous to the Corner of the Hedge, which is next to the Common Way which leads into the <HI>Forth.</HI> Then by and over the Common Way to the little Rivulet or Syke of Water in the Bottom of the Valley, and so passing the Syke, you go upwards to the Close called <HI>Goose-green-Close.</HI> The Forth contains 11 Acres of Ground. It was surveyed by Order of the Parliament, in the Year 1649, and valued at 12 l. per Annum.</P>
<P>IT was valued Tythe-free. The Town pay'd 4 l. per Annum to the King for it.</P>
<P>HOW it comes to be called <HI>Forth</HI> or <HI>Frith,</HI> I can only conjecture. The Word <NOTE N="s" PLACE="marg">Blount Law Dictio∣nary in verb. <HI>Frith.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Forth</HI> or <HI>Frith,</HI> as it is anciently called, comes from the <HI>Saxon</HI> Word <HI>Frith,</HI> which signifies <HI>Peace.</HI> For the English <HI>Saxons</HI> held several Woods to be sacred, and made them <HI>Sanctuaries.</HI> From this Definition of the Word, it may be no improbable Conjecture that the ancient <HI>Saxons</HI> inhabiting about the Parts of the Wall where the Town now is, gave the Name of <HI>Frith</HI> to
<PB N="146" REF="157"/>
this Place, as it was perhaps endowed with gloomier Shades and darker Re∣cesses, the awful Excitors of Heathen Superstition, than other Places about the Town were.</P>
<P>IN the Reign of King <HI>Henry</HI> III. a Licence was granted to the Townsmen of <HI>Newcastle,</HI> bearing Date <HI>Dec.</HI> 23d of his Reign to dig Coals and Stones, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in this Place called the <HI>Forth.</HI> And here it was as some think, or rather as others, in the <HI>Castle Leases</HI> that the first <HI>Newcastle</HI> Coals were wrought.</P>
<P>IT seems to have been all along a Place of Pleasure and Recreation. For it was an ancient Custom for the Mayor, Aldermen, and Sheriff of this Town, accompanied with great Numbers of the Burgesses, to go every Year at the Feasts of <HI>Easter</HI> and <HI>Whitsuntide</HI> to the <HI>Forth,</HI> with the Maces, Sword and Cap of Maintenance carried before them. Undoubtedly the vast Concourse of both young and old at this Place at these Seasons of the Year, rather than at any other about this Town, is the remains of this ancient Custom.</P>
<P>AFTER the building of the <HI>Castle</HI> it is said (but without any just Autho∣rity) that the <HI>Forth</HI> was anciently a <HI>Fort</HI> belonging to the <HI>Castle.</HI></P>
<P>IN the Year <GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> , Part of it was turned into a pretty large Bowling-Green; which was adorn'd with a broad Gravel Walk and a double Row of Trees around it. It is at present a mighty pretty Place, exceeding by much any Common Place of Pleasure about the Town. On the East-side of it, you have a Prospect of Part of the Town's Wall, through which is the Common Passage to and from this Place under a shady Walk of Trees; on the West you View the Grounds of the Village of <HI>Elswick,</HI> which have a gentle ascent to the Village itself; a Place at the proper Season of the Year much frequen∣ted by the Town's People, for its pleasing Walk and rural Entertainment.</P>
<P>FROM this Quarter we view also as we do from the South, the Banks of the River <HI>Tyne,</HI> together with their Villages. On the North is an House of Accommodation.</P>
<P><HI>GREY</HI> says that it was given to the Townsmen for their Services, by <HI>Edward</HI> III. Whereas it seems to have been theirs in the Reign of <HI>Hen.</HI> III. However if the other Conjecture be true, I verily believe it was given to the Town for that memorable Victory obtain'd by the Townsmen, when the Earl of <HI>Murray</HI> was taken Prisoner, which is commemorated in <HI>Anno Christi,</HI> 1342.</P>
</DIV3>

<HEAD>Sect. II. <HI>Of</HI> WARDEN-CLOSE.</HEAD>
<P>FROM hence we proceed to the West-gate, which gives Name to a little Village within the Bounds of the County of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> from whence still going on by the Out-side of the Town's Wall, we come to the <HI>Warden's-close.</HI> It seems to be called the <HI>Warden's-close,</HI> because it belong'd to the Wardens of the Priory of <HI>Tinmouth.</HI> For <HI>Grey</HI> tells us he had his House, Garden, and Fish-Pond, &amp;c. here. This indeed is not improbable, for the Monastery of the <HI>Black-Fryers</HI> was dependant upon the Priory of <HI>Tinmouth:</HI> And we are sure that this <HI>Close</HI> was Part of the Garden belonging to the <HI>Black-Fryers</HI> in former Times. And there are still the seeming Remains of Fish-Ponds, Gar∣dens, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="147" REF="158"/>AT the Top of this Field towards the North, is a Field call'd the <HI>Shoulder of Mutton Close,</HI> because it is in the Shape of a <HI>Shoulder of Mutton,</HI> which must formerly have been Part of the <HI>Warden's-close.</HI> In this is a Cistern of Water, which a curious Friend of mine imagines, supplyed the <HI>Black-Fryers.</HI> This perhaps may be true enough. The Well belonging to this Monastry may pro∣ceed from it. But I take its grand Use to have been to supply with Water the Fish-Ponds and Gardens just now mentioned.</P>

<HEAD>Sect. III. <HI>Of</HI> NEWGATE Suburbs.</HEAD>
<P>THE Suburbs out of Newgate <HI>Grey</HI> informs us, were ruined in the late Civil Wars. However the Street <HI>Gallowgate,</HI> (so called because of the Way that the Malefactors of the Town of <HI>Newcastle</HI> go to the Gallows, which is situated in a very low Place called the <HI>Gallows-hole</HI>) Is become again a very tollerable Street, and a very pleasant Place, having in it some good Houses, which are situated in Gardens and Fields. At the Top of this Street is a Lane which leads to the West-gate, Quarry-house, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> it borders upon a Field called the <HI>Shoulder of Mutton Close.</HI></P>

<P>OPPOSITE to this Lane is the <HI>Castle Leases,</HI> called anciently the <HI>Castle Field,</HI> a large Piece of Ground belonging to the Town, containing 141 Acres 12 Perches: <HI>Grey</HI> informs us, that Tradition said it was the Gift of King <HI>John</HI> to the good Men of <HI>Newcastle.</HI> However this be, it is certain that it had been the Town's immemorially or Time out of Mind, in the Reign of King <HI>Edward</HI> III. For in the 31st of that Reign the Town of <HI>Newcastle</HI> took an Inquisition in the <HI>Castle Field</HI> on a <HI>Palm</HI> Sunday Eve, the 31st Year of King <HI>Edward</HI> III. desiring the Confirmation of the Castle Moor and Field, and the Privileges belonging to them: And the King by his Letters Patents dated at <HI>Westminster,</HI> confirmed to the Burgesses of <HI>Newcastle</HI> the other Charters they had obtain'd, and also confirmed to them the Possession of the Castle Moor, <NOTE N="t" PLACE="marg"><P>Concessi∣mus pro no∣bis &amp; here∣dibus nostris quod predi∣cti Burgenses &amp; eorum he∣redes habe∣ant &amp; te∣neant mo∣ram &amp; ter∣ras predictas</P>

<P>THIS Place was formerly the Inheritance of divers Persons, Owners there∣of, who were accustomed from ancient Time, to take the fore Crop thereof yearly, at or before <HI>Lammas-Day,</HI> and after that, by an ancient Custom, all the Burgesses of this Town used to put in their Kine, and used the same in pa∣sturing of them 'till <HI>Lady-day</HI> in <HI>Lent</HI> yearly, and then to lay the same for Meadow again 'till <HI>Lammas.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="148" REF="159"/>IN the Year 1679, when <HI>George Morton</HI> was Mayor, the Town purchased the Sweepage of the Castle Leases for the Benefit of the Burgesses.</P>
<P>IN the 33d of <HI>Charles</HI> II. a Licence was granted the Mayor and Burgesses to purchase the Sweepage of the <HI>Castle Leases.</HI></P>
<P>THE Grounds of it abut on the said Castle Moor on the East and North Parts, upon the Highway leading to <HI>Kenton</HI> on the West, and on the other Way leading to the said Castle Moor on the South.</P>
<P>WHEN the Parliament took an Inquisition of it, the Forth and Town Moor in the Year 49, were valued at 27 l. per Annum.</P>
<P>THE Mill in the <HI>Castle Leases,</HI> commonly called <HI>Chimley Mill,</HI> upon the Syke or Rivulet called <HI>Bailiff-Burn,</HI> and the other Mill called <HI>Little Mill,</HI> were at the same Time valued at 10 l. per Annum each.</P>
<P>THIS Ground was always valued Tythe-free.</P>
<P>ON the West and North of the <HI>Castle Leases</HI> lies the <HI>Town-Moor.</HI> It is a very spacious Piece of Ground, containing 1037 Acres, one Rood, two Per∣ches. It was originally a Wood, very famous for Oak Trees, out of which have been built many hundred of Ships, and all the Houses of the old Town of <HI>Newcastle.</HI></P>
<P>THIS <HI>Moor,</HI> together with the <HI>Castle Leases,</HI> or <HI>Castle Lizards,</HI> called an∣ciently the <HI>Castle Moor,</HI> and <HI>Castle Field,</HI> were the Right of the Town of <HI>Newcastle,</HI> and had been so Time out of Mind, as has been just now observed in the Reign of King <HI>Edward</HI> III. who in his Charter of the Town, dated the Tenth of <HI>May,</HI> in the 31st Year of his Reign, confirmed the Holding and Possessing of it, and the Working of Coals, Stones, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in it; together with all the Profits arising from it (in the same Manner he had confirmed all the Immunities and Privileges, which had been granted by the Kings, his Predecessors.) to the Burgesses of <HI>Newcastle.</HI></P>
<P>THE ancient Bounds of the <HI>Town-Moor,</HI> which are the same to this Day, and answer still in every Particular, are thus described in the Charter above-mentioned.</P>

had an Immemorial Right to the Town-Moor, in the Days of <HI>Edward</HI> III. and this is proved from his Charter above-mentioned; then it is very impro∣bable that <HI>Adamarus de Athol,</HI> of <HI>Gesmunde,</HI> should be the Donor of it.

Novicast. p. 9.</NOTE> <HI>Adam</HI> was High Sheriff of the County of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> in the Fifth of <HI>Richard</HI> II. and was living in the Year of our Lord 1392, as appears by an Indulgence of 40 Days granted to the Church of St. <HI>Andrew</HI>'s, which was in the Proceedings upon a Dispute, about 30 Years after, relating to the <HI>Town-Moor.</HI> It is declared, that the <HI>Town-Moor</HI> had belonged to the Town of <HI>Newcastle</HI> immemorially, or Time out of Mind: But how can it be said to be in the Possession of the Town for so long a Time, when he himself, who gave it, lived thirty Years after this Declaration? And if he did so; no doubt but several others liv'd so long too. Either then the Town was not at the Time of this Dispute immemorially in the Possession of this Ground, or this <HI>Adamarus de Athol,</HI> was not the Donor of it. Again, had he been the Donor of it, he must have been 120 Years old at his Death; that is to say, he liv'd thirty Years after this Dispute, and Ninety before to make it immemorial; (which is the least Time that can be allow'd to make any Thing so) so that these two put together will make that Number of Years at his Death. It is not indeed in this Age of the World impossible for a Man to live so long, but yet it is highly improbable. There are few come to this Age, and when they do, they are look'd upon as so many great Exceptions to the general Rule of the Ages of Men; and then their Ages stand upon Record to succceed∣ing Generations; and no doubt, had this been true of <HI>Adam de Athol,</HI> it wou'd at least have been mention'd upon his <HI>Tomb-Stone,</HI> but we find no such Thing. Nay, should we allow, for the Sake of making him the Donor, that he really lived 120 Years; yet after all, this grand Absurdity would fol∣low, that if the <HI>Town,</HI> when this Dispute happen'd, had had it immemorially; he must have made a Present of it on the very Day he was born.</P>
<P>FOR these Reasons therefore it's impossible he should be the Donor of it, but some of his <HI>Ancestors</HI> of the same Name might: And this is the rather to be imagin'd, because Tradition says, it was <HI>Adam de Athol,</HI> of <HI>Jesumund,</HI> hand∣ing down the Name to this Day. As then he was of the same Name, and undoubtedly a great Benefactor to this Town, so the good Deeds of some of his Ancestors might have been ascribed to him through Mistake, and so be handed down to this present Day. There was one <HI>Adam de Jesumuthia,</HI> or <HI>Gesmund,</HI> who order'd that one <HI>Good-Plank,</HI> or <HI>Six-Shillings,</HI> should be given annually (as may be seen in the Account of the <HI>Tyne-Bridge</HI>) for the Repara∣tion of the <HI>Bridge.</HI> Perhaps it was him, for the Bridge was burnt in the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> III. in the Year 1248, and immediately they set about the Repair of it, and this <HI>Adam</HI> was one of the Benefactors to it. If then Tra∣dition says true, that <HI>Adam de Jesmund</HI> was the Donor of the <HI>Town-Moor</HI> to the Town, this is probably the very Man, and whether he gave it before the Burning of the <HI>Bridge,</HI> or at the Time of his Benefaction to the <HI>Bridge;</HI> yet in the Thirty first of <HI>Edward</HI> III. it would undoubtedly have been the Town's immemorially, which is a good presumptive Proof of this Conjun∣cture, that this was the very Man. Be this as it will, it is certain that it had been the Town of <HI>Newcastle</HI>'s Time out of Mind in the Thirty first Year of <HI>Edward</HI> III. and was then confirm'd to them, as has been observed above; in our Account of the <HI>Castle Leases.</HI></P>
<P>TWO Fairs are kept upon this Moor, on the First of <HI>August,</HI> and Eigh∣teenth of <HI>October,</HI> of which the <HI>Tolls, Booths, Stallage, Pickage,</HI> and Courts of <HI>Pic-powder,</HI> to each of the Fairs, were reckoned worth <HI>communibus Annis</HI> 12 l. in <HI>Oliver</HI>'s Time.</P>
<P>IN the Survey made of the <HI>Town-Moor,</HI> in the troublesome Times, it was reported that the <HI>Coal Mine,</HI> or <HI>Colliery,</HI> in the <HI>Town-Moor,</HI> extended it self under the Superficies of the <HI>Town-Moor one hundred Acres,</HI> and that the Value of it was to the Town 35 <HI>l. per Annum.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="150" REF="161"/>IT is the <HI>Pasture</HI> for the Cows belonging to the Freemen of <HI>Newcastle.</HI></P>
<P>IT is much frequented by the Gentry of this Town, and others for Exer∣cise and Health; it being (that Part of it especially call'd the <HI>Cow-hill,</HI>) a Place of the most wholesome Air about the Town.</P>

<HEAD>Of the <HI>NUN-MOOR.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>Nun-Moor</HI> is that large Piece of Ground that lies on the West of the <HI>Town-Moor,</HI> between the <HI>Thorn-Bush</HI> and the <HI>Hedge</HI> that separates from it the Grounds of <HI>Kenton.</HI></P>
<P><HI>RICHARD</HI> I. confirm'd to St. <HI>Mary</HI>'s and the <HI>Nuns</HI> of <HI>Newcastle,</HI> what∣soever had been given them by <HI>Asalack,</HI> the Founder of that <HI>Hospital;</HI> (as is observable in his Charter of the Founding of St. <HI>Mary</HI>'s) whatever belonged to him, as well in Land as in Money, or Houses; whatever he had acquired and obtained, both within and without the Town of <HI>Newcastle,</HI> all these he confirmed; and he himself also gave them two <HI>Carucates</HI> of Land of his own, that they might pray for his Soul. This is supposed to be the Charter for the Confirmation of <HI>Nun-field,</HI> or as it seems to have been otherwise called <HI>Nun-house,</HI> in the <HI>Town-Moor.</HI> And if this Conjecture be true, it is clear that this <HI>Asalack</HI> gave the <HI>Nun-Moor</HI> to the <HI>Nuns</HI> of St. <HI>Bartholomew,</HI> and not as is commonly reported <HI>Adam de Athol.</HI> These <HI>Nuns</HI> were the <HI>Occasion</HI> of it's being intituled <HI>Nun-field,</HI> or <HI>Nun-house,</HI> or the <HI>Nun-Moor,</HI> as it is called at this Day.</P>
<P>IN the Fourth of the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> VII. Dame <HI>Joan,</HI> Prioress of the Monastry of St. <HI>Bartholomew</HI> the Apostle, in <HI>Newcastle</HI> upon <HI>Tyne,</HI> and Con∣vent of the same, granted a Lease of the <HI>Nun-Moor</HI> for an hundred Years to the <HI>Mayor, Sheriff, Aldermen,</HI> and <HI>Commonality</HI> of this Town, under the year∣ly Rent of one Pound three Shillings and four Pence. Hence it is plain that this Moor belonged to those <HI>Nuns,</HI> and took it's Name from them.</P>
<P>IN the Eleventh of <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. there was an award between the said <HI>Priory</HI> and <HI>Convent,</HI> and <HI>William Bennet,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> Owner of <HI>Kenton,</HI> about the Bounders of it.</P>
<P>IN the Thirty sixth of the same Reign, it was granted to <HI>John Broxholm,</HI> in Consideration of 1122 <HI>l.</HI> 15 <HI>s.</HI> 6 <HI>d.</HI> and was conveyed by those claiming un∣der him to the <HI>Mayor</HI> and <HI>Burgesses</HI> of <HI>Newcastle</HI> upon <HI>Tyne.</HI></P>

<P>THE other Parts of the Suburbs out of <HI>Newgate</HI> is a Street that reaches as far as the <HI>Barras-bridge,</HI> called <HI>Sidgate,</HI> which consists of Houses very indiffe∣rent, most of which are inhabited by poor People; but very sweetly situated, having the <HI>Leases</HI> or Gardens behind them.</P>

<HEAD>Sect. V. <HI>Of the Suburbs of</HI> PILGRIM-STREET.</HEAD>
<P>WE come now to the Suburbs of <HI>Pilgrim-street</HI> gate; which were also ruinated in the late Civil Wars. But at present it is a very well built Street, having in it some very pretty Houses, such as are the Houses of Mr. <HI>John Stephenson,</HI> Merchant, Mr.<HI>John Morris,</HI> Hoastman, and several be∣longing to Mr. <HI>William Graham,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>THIS Street is the most Pleasant Situation of any within or without the Town.</P>
<P>IT stands as it were in the middle of Gardens and Shady Fields, which make it a delicious Place in the Summer Season.</P>
<P>IN the upper Part of it, nigh the <HI>Barras-bridge,</HI> are to be seen the Remains of the Hospital dedicated to St. <HI>Mary Magdalen,</HI> which was vulgarly called, the <HI>Maidlein</HI>'s. It was seated at the Summit of an Hill, beneath which is the Well called St. <HI>Mary Magdalen</HI>'s Well, so named from the Hospital, as are al∣so several Fields which to this Day are called the <HI>Maidlin</HI> Meadows.</P>
<P>IT was founded by King <HI>Henry</HI> I. for a Master, Brethren and Sisters to re∣ceive <HI>Leprous Folks,</HI> and since that Sickness abated, for the poor of the Town in Time of Pestilence. Fourteen within the House were allowed every one a Room, 8 <HI>s. per</HI> Month, Coals, and Fifteen without, some 8 <HI>s. per</HI> Month, some 5 <HI>s.</HI> some 2 <HI>s.</HI> 6 <HI>d.</HI></P>

It is recorded of him, that he died the Day before the Feast of St. <HI>Michael</HI> the Archangel, or on the 28th of <HI>September,</HI> in the ninth Hour of that Day, in the Year of our Lord 1374. His Body was buried nigh the High-Altar, on the North side of the Chancel, in St. <HI>Mary Magdalen</HI>'s Chapel.</P>
<P>HE was a great Benefactor to this Hospital, as appears from his Charity and Generosity in the first Year of his Mastership. For whereas <HI>Laurentius Acton</HI> had the said Hospital in perpetuum, for himself, his Heirs and Assigns, this worthy Man paid for his own Right 40 Marks to the said <HI>Laurentius,</HI> and the said <HI>Laurentius</HI> had the first Fruits belonging to the said Hospital, which yearly amounted to the Sum of 200 Marks.</P>
<P>ONE <HI>Richard Sperman</HI> had an annual Pension from the said Hospital of 8 Marks, which Pension the abovementioned Gentleman in the 2d Year of his Mastership bought out for the said Hospital.</P>
<P>HE also the same Year freed the said Hospital from an annual Pension, which was payable to <HI>Hugo de Mitford.</HI></P>
<P>THE same Master of this Hospital, in this same Year following, built in the said Hospital a Consistory, a Stable, and a Bier, and made in the Quire two New Windows facing the South of the said Chapel, besides a Number of other good and generous Charities which he bestowed upon this Hospital.</P>
<P><PB N="152" REF="163"/>THE same Gentleman proves judicially in the King's Court, that the Mayor and Commonalty of <HI>Newcastle</HI> upon <HI>Tine,</HI> did assign, present, and in∣duct the Master of the said Hospital. He was Master of the said Hospital about five Years.</P>
<P>IN the Reign of our Lord 1564, in the 6th of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> one <HI>Edmund Wiseman,</HI> Servant to the right Honourable Sir <HI>Nicholas Bacon,</HI> Knight, and Keeper of the Great Seal of <HI>England,</HI> obtained by the Procurement of one <HI>Cuthbert Bewick,</HI> a Burgess and Merchant of this Town of <HI>Newcastle,</HI> a Pre∣sentation from the Queen, of the Hospital of St. <HI>Mary Magdalen,</HI> lying with∣out the Wall of <HI>Newcastle;</HI> of which Hospital the Mayor and Burgesses of this Town were the true and very Patrons, and had till then presented Time out of <NOTE N="y" PLACE="marg">The West-Spittle, the Hospital cal∣led the <HI>Mag∣dalens,</HI> and the Chapel of St. <HI>Thomas</HI> the Martyr, have been given by the Mayor and Burgesses of <HI>Newcastle,</HI> Time out of Mind.</NOTE> Mind. By Virtue of this Presentation from the Queen, <HI>James</HI> Bi∣shop of <HI>Durham</HI> would have inducted the said <HI>Wiseman</HI> (in the Year afore∣said, betwixt <HI>Lammas</HI> and <HI>Martinmas</HI>) into the Possession of the said Hospi∣tal; but the <HI>Mayor</HI> and <HI>Aldermen</HI> of the Town having Respect to the Defence of their Patronage, would in no wise permit the said Bishop to give Induction therein: For the Hospital of St. <HI>Mary Magdalen</HI> was a Donative, and not a Benefice inductible by any Bishop.</P>
<P>IN the Year 1569, 15th <HI>February,</HI> the Mayor and Burgesses of <HI>Newcastle</HI> granted the next Presentation of St. <HI>Mary Magdalen,</HI> commonly called the <HI>Maid<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>enes,</HI> to <HI>Henry Anderson, Robert Mitford,</HI> and <HI>Christopher Mitford.</HI></P>
<P>IN the Account of <HI>Ficket-Tower,</HI> there is Mention made of a <HI>Great Cross,</HI> standing within <HI>Maudlin-Barras;</HI> and in the <HI>Milbank</HI> Manuscript it is said, <HI>At the End of the</HI> Barras<HI>-Bridge before the Chapel stood a stately Cross firm and compleat,</HI> and <NOTE N="z" PLACE="marg">This <HI>Pigg</HI> was a Rebel, a very great <HI>Enthusiast,</HI> a Monument of his whimsi∣cal Head is that <HI>Stone-Pillar,</HI> a lit∣tle North of the three <HI>Mile Bridge,</HI> which every deservedly to this Day, bears the Title of <HI>Pig</HI>'s Folly.</NOTE> <HI>John Pigg</HI> in the Time of the Rebellion took it down, and called it Idolatry, and thought to make his own Use of it; but it was broke by some who hated it should be prophaned. This Hospital at the Suppres∣sion was valued at 9 <HI>l.</HI> 11 <HI>s.</HI> 4 <HI>d.</HI></P>
<P>LEAVING St. <HI>Mary Magdalens,</HI> we go forward to the End of this Street, which together with the End of the Street leading from <HI>Newgate,</HI> meets at the <HI>Barras-Bridge.</HI></P>
<P>HOW it comes by the Name of <HI>Barras-Bridge, Grey</HI> gives us no Account. Others have imagined it to be so called, from a Person of that Name, who was its Builder or Benefactor. This Conjecture in my Opinion is a grand Mistake; for we have just now mentioned the <HI>Maudlin-Barras,</HI> and therefore the Word <HI>Barras</HI> must imply something else. The Manuscript above men∣tioned speaking of the Antiquity of St. <HI>Andrew</HI>'s Church, gives this as a Reason of its being the oldest in Town, because it is next the <HI>Barras,</HI> which hath been the ancient <HI>Barracado</HI> of the Town. So then according to this Ac∣count, it got its Name from the Word <HI>Barracado.</HI> This also in my Opinion is a Mistake. For the Word <HI>Barrows</HI> (for so it should be spell'd) signifies the same as <HI>Tinnuli,</HI> Hillocks, and sometimes <HI>Graves</HI> and <HI>Sepulchres:</HI> And when it is considered, that the Hospital of St. <HI>Mary Magdalen</HI> was founded for the Reception of <HI>Leprous Folks,</HI> it is easy to see, that the <HI>Maudlin-Borrows</HI> are the <HI>Tombs</HI> or <HI>Burial-Places</HI> of those that died of the <HI>Leprosy</HI> in that <HI>Hospi∣tal;</HI> and since the Burial-place it self was nigh to the Bridge, the Bridge got thence the Name of the <HI>Barrows-Bridge.</HI> The <HI>Barras</HI> mentioned in the Ac∣count of <HI>Ficket-Tower</HI> are the same Thing; nothing else but the Burial-place of the <HI>Franciscan Friars.</HI></P>
<P>THE Place of the <HI>Maudlin Barrows</HI> I take to be the sick Man's Close; for as after the abating of the Leprosy, this Hospital was obliged to take the Poor of the Town in during the Time of the Pestilence; so I question not, but those that died were buried in the ancient Burial-place or Barrows of the Hospital. And since we are certain they were buried in the <HI>sick Man</HI>'s <HI>Close,</HI> we may
<PB N="153" REF="164"/>
be therefore almost certain, that the <HI>sick Man</HI>'s <HI>Close</HI> was the <HI>Barrows</HI> of this <HI>Hospital.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>Barrows-Mill</HI> belong'd to the <HI>black Friars;</HI> and in the Year 1558, paid a Rent to the Town of <HI>Newcastle</HI> of 2 <HI>s. per annum. Lib. Cart. p.</HI> 43.</P>
<P>THE Chapel on the other Side the <HI>Barrows-Bridge</HI> was dedicated to St. <HI>James</HI> the Apostle, and was anciently called St. <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg"><HI>See</HI> An∣drew <HI>Tower.</HI></NOTE> <HI>James</HI>'s Kirk. I suppose it was a <HI>Chapel</HI> of Ease to St. <HI>Andrew,</HI> for <HI>Jesmond</HI> and <HI>Sandiford,</HI> and other Out-parts of that Parish.</P>

<HEAD><HI>Sect. VI.</HI> Of the Suburbs of <HI>PANDON.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Suburbs out of <HI>Pandon-Gate</HI> are but very few Houses; but there are <HI>Gardens</HI> all the Way up the Causeway; two of them are those of Mr. <HI>John Simpson</HI> and Mr. <HI>Charles Atkinson.</HI> This Way was within these four Years the pleasantest Entrance into the Town of <HI>Newcastle,</HI> having Gardens on each Side, beset with <HI>Trees</HI> of so large a Size and Shade, that they covered the Street itself in several Places. These were cut down for a little unpossest Money, and the greatest Beauty of the Street lost.</P>
<P>THERE are in this Street two or three Passages, leading to different Places, which it may not be amiss to mention. After you are out of <HI>Pandon-gate,</HI> there is one on the left Hand leading to <HI>Pandon-Dean,</HI> a very <HI>Romantick Place,</HI> full of Hills and Vales, through which runs <HI>Pandon-Burn.</HI> It is a very entertaining Walk in the Summer to <HI>Magdalen</HI>-Well. A little above this is another very narrow Passage on the right Hand, bordering upon Mr. <HI>Harrison</HI>'s Garden, which leads to a Place called the <HI>Garth-Heads,</HI> which was a Place of Pleasure and Recreation; but of late it was taken in, and made a <HI>common Gar∣den</HI> of, by <HI>Richard Ridley,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> the Proprietor of it.</P>
<P>HAVING past this Lane, we proceed till we come to the Top of this great Ascent (for such indeed is this Street) and there we meet with two Ways; the one leads to the <HI>Shield-Field,</HI> the Property of Mr. <HI>Charles Clark</HI> of <HI>New∣castle,</HI> which has been already mentioned; and the other to <HI>Owse-Burn,</HI> which is at present a large Village, occasioned by the Coal-works of <HI>Richard Ridley</HI> and <HI>Matthew White,</HI> <ABBR>Esqs</ABBR> <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>IT takes its Name from the Burn that runs through it. The Banks of this Burn are in many Places terribly high, in all Places beautifully Roman∣tick.</P>
<P>BEFORE we come to the Suburbs of <HI>Sandgate,</HI> we must not omit to men∣tion the <HI>Keelmens Hospital;</HI> it is situated some Distance East of the <HI>Town's Wall,</HI> between the <HI>Carpenters Tower</HI> and <HI>Sandgate.</HI> It is a square Building, done in the Form of <HI>Monasteries</HI> and <HI>Colleges,</HI> having its low Walk round it, in Imitation of <HI>Cloysters.</HI> The Area in the Middle of it, is about 83 Foot broad, and about 97½ Foot long. There are upwards of fifty Chambers in it. Who it was built by, may be learned from the Inscription above the En∣trance of it, which is as follows: <HI>The Keelmens Hospital, built at their own Charge,</HI> Anno Domini 1701, Matthew White, <HI><ABBR>Esq</ABBR> Governour, Mr.</HI> Edward Grey, <HI>Mr.</HI> Edward Carr, <HI>Stewards of the Hoastmens Company for the Time be∣ing,
<PB N="154" REF="165"/>
and Trustees for this Hospital.</HI> I have been told, that Dr. <HI>Moor,</HI> one of the late Bishops of <HI>Ely,</HI> upon going down the River in the Town's Barge with the Magistrates, observed it, and made Enquiry after it. And being told, that it was built by the <HI>Keelmen</HI> themselves (every one allowing towards it a <HI>Penny a Tide</HI>) he said, that he had heard of, and seen many Hospitals, the Works of <HI>rich Men;</HI> but that was the first he ever saw or heard of, which had been built by the Poor. 'Tis a great Pity that the Design of its Building is not throughly answer'd; but there are some Miscreants, who would rather starve in Sickness or old Age, than not guzzle a Penny in their Health and Youth.</P>

<HEAD>Sect. VI. <HI>Of the</HI> Suburbs <HI>of</HI> SANDGATE.</HEAD>
<P>THE Suburbs of <HI>Sandgate</HI> (excepting some Houses nigh the Walls of the Town) we are informed escap'd the Fury of the Civil Wars. This Street has it's Name from it's Situation, which is upon the Sand. For this whole Street as well as the <HI>Sandhill,</HI> and all the lower Parts of the Town in ancient Times was the Common Sand or Shore of the River.</P>
<P>THIS Street has in it a vast Number of narrow Lanes on each Side of it, which are crouded with Houses. It is chiefly inhabited by People that work upon the <HI>Water,</HI> particularly the <HI>Keelmen.</HI> The Number of Souls in this Street and the Lanes belonging to it, is computed to several Thousands.</P>
<P>ABOUT the middle of this Street is an open Place called the <HI>Squirrel,</HI> from a little Brook of that Name, which runs through it into the River <HI>Tyne,</HI> which was the ancient Bounds of the Town of <HI>Newcastle.</HI> From this, as far as the House of Mr. <HI>Jeremiah Cook,</HI> Shipwright, is the Street of <HI>Sandgate,</HI> then we enter St. <HI>Ann</HI>'s Street, (so called from the neighbouring Chapel) which leads us on to the <HI>Ropery,</HI> which is a long and pleasant Walk, giving an agreeable Prospect of the River, and a great Part of the Town and Neighbouring Places. What this Ropery was formerly, <HI>Grey</HI> gives us the best Account. Below East, says he, is the Ballast-Hill, where Women upon their Heads car∣ried Ballast, which was taken forth of the small Ships which came empty for Coals; which Place was the first Ballast Shore out of the Town; since which Time, the Trade increasing, there are many Ballast Shores below the Water, on both Sides of the River; much the same Account is given of this, in the Manuscript so frequently mentioned; the Hoastmen got Leave at first to lead Coals above the <HI>Bourn,</HI> and that occasioned their Delivery of Ballast upon the <HI>Lime-Kiln</HI> Road, and the Women bore the Ballast upon their Heads, and made the Ballast-Hills; for the Town had procured all that Shore of the Lords of <HI>Byker</HI> for that Use, and to build Lime-Kilns upon.</P>
<P>ON the North of this Ropery stands the Chapel of St. <HI>Ann,</HI> which is a a Chapel of East to the Church of <HI>All-hallows,</HI> which tho' pretty large is yet much too little for the Parish, it being perhaps one of the largest Parishes in the whole Kingdom.</P>
<P>WHEN it was originally built I have met with nothing that gives any Ac∣count. after the Reformation it was neglected and came into Decay; but the Town in the Year 1682. repair'd it, and settled a Lecturer there, to preach in the Morning, and to expound the <HI>Catechism</HI> every Sunday Afternoon; which the Town allow'd 30 <HI>l.</HI> per Annum for; at the Opening of it, after it was repaired, the Rev. Mr. <HI>March,</HI> then Vicar of the Town, preached the first
<PB N="155" REF="166"/>
Sermon, in it, which was Printed, and Intitled, <HI>Th'</HI> Encaenia <HI>of St.</HI> Ann<HI>'s Cha∣pel in</HI> Sandgate.</P>
<P>IT has at present two Lecturers, which are paid by the Town, the Rev. Mr. <HI>Clayton,</HI> and the Rev. Mr. <HI>Maddison;</HI> to the former the Town pays 40 <HI>l. per Annum,</HI> and to the latter 50 <HI>l.</HI></P>
<P>BELOW this to the Glass-house-bridge are the Houses of Ship-Wrights, and Master-Builders, such as Mr. <HI>Thomas Wallas,</HI> Mr. <HI>Roger Durham,</HI> Mr. <HI>John Lattany,</HI> Mr. <HI>Cuthbert Preston,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Glass-house-bridge,</HI> so called because of the <HI>Glass-houses</HI> which are al∣most contiguous to it, was originally a Wood-Bridge, as the Bridge higher up the <HI>Bourn</HI> was, 'till within these 6 or 7 Years; but in the Year 1669, when <HI>Ralph Jenison,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> was Mayor, it was made of Stone by <HI>Thomas Wrang∣ham,</HI> Ship-Wright, on Account of Lands which the Town let him; The Passage however over it was very difficult and uneven 'till the Year 1729, When <HI>Stephen Coulson,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> was Mayor, it was made level and commodious both for Horse and Foot.</P>
<P>ON the other Side of the Bridge are the <HI>Glass-houses,</HI> which in <HI>Grey</HI>'s Time served most Part of the Kingdom with Window-Glass.</P>
<P>SOMETIME in the Reign of Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> came over to <HI>England</HI> from <HI>Lorrain,</HI> the <HI>Henzels, Tyzacks</HI> and <HI>Tytorys.</HI> The Reason of their coming hither was the Persecution of the Protestants in their own Country, of whose Per∣suasion they were. They were by Occupation Glass-makers. At their first coming to this Town they wrought in their Trade at the Close-gate, after that they removed into <HI>Staffordshire,</HI> from whence they removed again and settled upon the River Side at the Place called from their abiding in it the <HI>Glass-houses.</HI> Deservedly therefore have so many of these Families been named <HI>Peregrines</HI> from the Latin Word <HI>Peregrinus</HI> which signifies a Pilgrim or a Stranger.</P>
<P>HAVING at last settled here they became very numerous, and generally married into each others Families to preserve the three Names of <HI>Henzel, Ty∣zack</HI> and <HI>Tytory.</HI> But the latter of them within this Few Years became ex∣tinct. There are of the <HI>Tyzacks</HI> several remaining; but the <HI>Henzels</HI> are most numerous.</P>

<P>IT is observable in this Place when the Coal Trade is brisk, that all other Business is so too; and when it is otherwise, through the Contracts of the Coal Owners, or of the Masters, that there is a certain Deadness in all Tra∣fick. It is the Money arising from the Coal Trade, that almost entirely Cir∣culates in this great Town and adjacent Country.</P>
<P>IT has been observed by <NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg">Fleetwood Preciosum Chronicon 118. p.</NOTE> some, that Sea Coal has not been in Use above 150 Years, at least not in <HI>London;</HI> and that when we meet with Coals in old Accounts, it is meant of Charcoal. I can scarce be of this Opinion, if it was but for what the said Authority himself acknowledgeth, <HI>viz.</HI> that <HI>Carbo Ma∣rinus,</HI> or Sea Coal, is mentioned in <HI>Matthew Paris.</HI> And in the 1st of <HI>Edward</HI> III. there is mention made <HI>de Carbonibus marithnis,</HI> of Sea Coals and the Mea∣sure of them.</P>
<P>HOWEVER this be, nigh this Town of <HI>Newcastle</HI> Coals were work'd very early, in a Charter of King <HI>Hen.</HI> III. dated <HI>Dec.</HI> 1, 23d of that King's Reign, Licence was granted to the Town of <HI>Newcastle,</HI> to dig Coals in the <HI>Castle-Field</HI> and the <HI>Frith.</HI></P>
<P>IN the Year 1421, the 9th of <HI>Hen.</HI> V. Two-pence per Chaldron being paid to the King for all Coals sold at the Port of <HI>Newcastle,</HI> to People not enfran∣chised; it was enacted that the Keels should be of the Burthen of 20 Chal∣drons, and no more, according to Custom; some being of the Burthen of 22, and some of 24 Chaldrons built, to defraud the King of his Customs, and that the Keels should be sealed by the King's Officers. <HI>De. reb.</HI> 39.</P>
<P><PB N="159" REF="170"/>QUEEN <HI>Elizabeth</HI> demanding of the Town the Arrear of 2 <HI>d.</HI> per Chaldron, which had been neglected for many Years; the Town begg'd her Majesty that these Arrears might be forgiven, and to grant them a <NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">Gardner <HI>Queen</HI> Eliz, <HI>Charter.</HI></NOTE> Charter to incor∣porate a new Fraternity or Brother-hood, to be called <HI>Free Hoastmen,</HI> for the selling and vending of all Coals to Shipping. And in Consideration thereof they would pay to her Majesty and her Successors, 12 <HI>d.</HI> for every Chaldron exported from thenceforth to the free People of this Nation; this was taken into Consideration and granted.</P>
<P>IN the Year 1644, in the Time of the Civil War, the City of <HI>London</HI> re∣ceived a great Advantage by this Town's being taken; for almost two Years by-past, the poorer Sort of People had been almost starved, Coals hav∣ing risen to the Price of 4 <HI>l.</HI> per Chaldron, a Price never known before that Time.</P>
<P>THIS Place is generally computed to vend upwards of 300,000 Chaldrons a-Year. There are likewise vast Exportations of Lead, Salt, Salmon, and Grindstones, which last Commodity, as <HI>Grey</HI> says, and is still true, are con∣veyed to most Parts of the World; according to the Proverb, <HI>A Scott, a Rat, and a Newcastle Grindstone you may find all the World over.</HI></P>
<P>IT is not in my Power to describe the Number of Arts and curious Ma∣chineries that are used in this Affair of the Coal Business; the sinking of Pits, Winning of Coals, Fire-Engines, Waggon-Ways, the Waggons, their ma∣naging of them, the Staiths, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> deserve a more skilful Pen. Thus much however I may venture to say, that those Waggon-Ways, a small Part of the whole Coal Works, may vie with some of the great Works of the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire.</P>

<P>THE Prior also built 4 Ovens at <HI>Tinmouth,</HI> which were rented at 5 <HI>l.</HI> 6 <HI>s.</HI> 8 <HI>d.</HI> per Ann. and kept a Market on the Lord's Day at <HI>Tinmouth.</HI> It was also ob∣jected to him, that the whole Country and the Mariners applied themselves, and sold their Goods and Merchandizes at <HI>Shields,</HI> to the King's great Detri∣ment, he receiving no Toll nor other Profits for the same.</P>
<P>THE King ought to have the Towage of Ships and Boats, greater and smaller, in the River of <HI>Tyne,</HI> in going up to <HI>Newcastle,</HI> and down to the Sea, freely over any Lord's Land, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The King ought to have in his Port 4 <HI>d.</HI> for every Boat that has an Oar, and 1 <HI>d.</HI> for every lesser one that has none.</P>
<P>In <HI>Answer,</HI></P>
<P>THE Prior said, the Premises did only touch his free Tenement, and he answered, that as for the Wreck of the Sea, the Forestalling of Merchandi∣zes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> He and his Predecessors had them by Charter of King <HI>John,</HI> Grand∣father of King <HI>Edward</HI> I. and so he proceeds to his new Town of <HI>Shields.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="162" REF="173"/>HE said also that he had no Market or Oven at <HI>Shields.</HI> But as to the Fish∣ers and buying of Fish, he saith, that his Predecessors in their Times have al∣ways had their own Fishers fishing in the same Water, for the Maintenance of their House, Toll free, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> because the Port of the Water of <HI>Tyne</HI> doth especially and entirely belong to the King, and that they (meaning the Prior and Convent of <HI>Tinmouth</HI>) have had certain their Tenants of <HI>Shields</HI> with their Boats within their Demesnes.</P>
<P>AND as for the Market at <HI>Tinmouth,</HI> he said he claimed none there; but he had a Tumbrel, and had hired Fishers, Brewers and Bakers, and also Sham∣bles there.</P>
<P>AS to the Charge of Towage he said, that he never hindered those that exercised any such Office in the Water of <HI>Tyne</HI> adjacent to his Land, save only at <HI>Elstwick</HI> or <HI>Astwick.</HI></P>
<P>HE said moreover, that before and at the Time of making King <HI>Richard</HI>'s Charter, which was before any Liberties granted to <HI>Newcastle</HI> by King <HI>John,</HI> the Priors of this House took and had all the Premises freely and quietly, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> by virtue of Custom of Liberties granted to them by their said Charter by Land and Water, whereof he found his Church seized, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>WHEREUPON he demanded Judgment.</P>
<P>THOSE who prosecuted for the King said, that the Charter was worth nothing. As to the Wreck of the Sea, they said, no sooner had the Ships applied themselves out of the great Sea into the said Port, and there had the Misfortune to break, then the said Prior taketh the Goods of such broken Ships, both swimming and therein abiding, and Converts them to his own Use; and that the then Prior was seized of ten Tuns of Wine, out of a cer∣tain Ship of <HI>Peter</HI> of <HI>Appleby</HI> Burgess of <HI>York,</HI> wrecked in the said Water.</P>
<P>AND as to the charging or discharging of Ships and of Merchandizes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> they said, that whereas the said Port of <HI>Tyne</HI> is only the King's, as often as the Prior should do so, the King was manifestly injured, being then, and al∣ways before in Seizin and Possession of the said Port.</P>
<P>AS to the Town of <HI>Shields,</HI> they said, that whatsoever small dwelling Houses there had been there, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> the said Prior (that then was) caused there to be made 26 Houses upon the King's Soil; because they are comprehended within the flowing and Inundation of the Sea, and they demanded the Record of Ju∣stice, that the said then Prior alledged that the King therein hath no soil, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but that it merely belong'd to him, even to the <NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg">This is sup∣posed to be the Low-Water Mark.</NOTE> Fill of the Water.</P>
<P>THEY also said, that in those Houses at <HI>Shields,</HI> there were Fishers and Brewers, and Victuallers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> so rich that they were able to give Loading and Victuals for 100 or 200 Ships, which ought to apply themselves at <HI>New∣castle</HI> upon <HI>Tyne,</HI> and there buy their Victuals for the bettering the said Town. Whereupon they said, that the said Prior is the only Occupier of the King's Soil, and the only Taker away of the said King's Town of <HI>Newcastle;</HI> and that he the said Prior had 16 Fishers or more, with great Boats, fishing in the Sea yearly for Traffick's Sake only, and not for Maintenance of his House; where∣of the King received neither Toll nor Custom.</P>

<P><HI>NEWBURN</HI> is a Village distant fron <HI>Newcastle</HI> about 4 Miles, and situ∣ated on the North side of the <HI>Tyne.</HI> It is of great Antiquity, as appears from the following Relation.</P>
<P><HI>COPSI,</HI> the first Earl of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> after the Conquest, was consti∣tuted such by the Conqueror, for that Part of the Province that lyeth North of the River: Whereupon he drove <HI>Osulph,</HI> whom <HI>Merker,</HI> the younger Son to <HI>Algar,</HI> Earl of <HI>Chester,</HI> the last Earl of <HI>Northumberland</HI> had substituted there.</P>
<P>AT length <HI>Osulph,</HI> whom he had so driven, being necessitated to betake himself to the Woods and Deserts for Refuge, gathered some Strength, and forcing <HI>Copsi,</HI> for Safeguard, to fly to the Church of <HI>Newburne,</HI> set it on Fire, and when <HI>Copsi</HI> (to save himself from the Flames) came out, did cut off his Head at the very Door, on the 4th of the Ides of <HI>March,</HI> in the 5th Week after he had the Administration of these Parts; but the very next Autumn this <HI>Osulph</HI> was himself slain by the Hands of a Robber. <HI>Bar.

<P>DR. <HI>Smith,</HI> late Bishop of <HI>Carlisle,</HI> finding the Vicarage of this Place to be small, and not able to maintain a Minister, made an Augmentation of 25 <HI>l.</HI> a Year to it since the Restoration of King <HI>Charles</HI> II. <HI>Magn. Britan. Vol.</HI> 3. <HI>p.</HI> 673.</P>

<P>THE next Village to it is <HI>Stella,</HI> a little below <HI>Newburn,</HI> on the other Side the Water. Here is a magnificent House and Gardens, which belonged to the Lord <HI>Widdrington,</HI> which became forfeited to the Crown in the Year 1715, for his entring into the <HI>Northumberland</HI> Rebellion. This Place origi∣nally belonged to the Nuns of <HI>Newcastle;</HI> it is now chiefly inhabited by Coal-Workers, and has Staiths in it.</P>
<P>THERE are many other Villages on the Sides of this River, such as <HI>Blaiden, Lemmington, Swalwel, Delaval, Redheugh,</HI> &amp;c. Several of them have Staiths belonging to them, such are the Staiths of the Lady <HI>Clavering,</HI> Sir <HI>Henry Liddel,</HI> Baronet, <HI>Richard Ridley,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> <HI>George Liddel,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> <HI>Edward Wortley Montague,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> <HI>George Bowes,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> <HI>George Pitt,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> <HI>George Malliber,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> Mr. <HI>John Simpson</HI> and Mr. <HI>Joseph Ledger.</HI></P>
<P>THERE is a little Island in the Midst of the River, called, <HI>The King's Meadows,</HI> which is a delicious Place, and a great Ornament to the Ri∣ver.</P>
<P>LET us now come below Bridge, to take Notice of a few Things there. <HI>Gateshead</HI> presents itself first, a Town in the Bishoprick of <HI>Durham;</HI> it stands on the South-side of the <HI>Tyne,</HI> opposite to <HI>Newcastle,</HI> and is a Place of great Antiquity. Mr. <HI>Cambden</HI> thinks it a Place of equal Antiquity with <HI>Newcastle,</HI> because of it's ancient Name <HI>Gabrosentum;</HI> but I have already proved it more rational to believe it to have been only it's Suburbs.</P>
<P>THERE was an ancient Monastry here in the Time of <HI>Bede;</HI> which was the Monastry of <HI>Utanus,</HI> it was where Mr. <HI>Riddle</HI>'s House, or <HI>Gateshead</HI> House is as it now stands.</P>
<P>ON the 14 of <HI>May,</HI> 1080, <HI>Walter</HI> Bishop of <HI>Durham</HI> was murdered at this Place. The Occasion of it was, this <HI>Walter</HI> attending more wordly Affairs than the Charge of his Flock, gave himself altogether to Temporal Business, wherein he wholly occupied himself. He bought of the King the Earldom of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> and then making himself a secular Judge, took upon him to sit in the Court, and to determine all Causes at his Pleasure, dealing withal very corruptly, and taking still the Course that might be most for his own
<PB N="167" REF="178"/>
Gain. Hereupon he greatly enriched his own Coffers, but purchased unto him∣self extreme Hatred amongst the Common People, which was his Destruction in the End. There was a certain Gentleman, of great Account, named <HI>Leul∣fus,</HI> that married <HI>Algitha,</HI> the Daughter of <HI>Aldred,</HI> sometime Earl of <HI>Nor∣thumberland,</HI> from whom the Lord <HI>Lumley</HI> that now liveth is lineally descend∣ed. This <HI>Leulfus,</HI> to the end he might live near the Church in his latter Time, and for very Devotion, came to <HI>Durham</HI> to dwell there, and kept Company very much with the Bishop, who loved him entirely, for many good Parts he saw in him, as namely, his Wisdom in discerning, his Equity in deciding, and his Discretion in ordering and handling such Causes as he committed unto him; in which Respect also he used him very familiarly, employed him often, and gave him what Countenance he could. Now, you shall understand, that unto the same Bishop belonged two Men, unto whom for the most Part he committed the ordering of all his Affairs; <HI>Leofwyn</HI> or <HI>Leobwyn</HI> his Chaplain, whom he trusted with all Houshold-Matters, and <HI>Gil∣bert,</HI> a Kinsman of his own, that dealt in his Causes of Temporal Govern∣ment. In their Offices they behaved themselves so, as the Bishop had Cause to commend their Diligence, but to blame their Rashness and Wilfulness in many Things, which notwithstanding he bore withal, either because their Industry and Care of his Affairs, so blinded his Eyes, as he could not espy their Misbehaviour otherwise, or else being loath to detest them whom he had once advanced. These Men, and especially <HI>Leofwyn,</HI> did greatly envy the Credit that <HI>Leulfus</HI> had gotten with the Bishop, and every where opposed themselves against him, not only in Words, traducing his Actions, but in Deeds also, thwarting and crossing his Endeavours, whereby it came to pass, that many Jars fell out between them. One Day amongst the rest, a Court being held in the Presence of the Bishop, <HI>Leofwyn</HI> or <HI>Leobwyn</HI> (for so also I find him called) according to his wonted Manner, gave <HI>Leulfus</HI> ill Speeches, which he not enduring to bear, as heretofore he had done <HI>(furor fit saepius lae∣sa patientia)</HI> answered this sawcy Chaplain somewhat more roundly than he had been accustomed. Whereupon he rose straight from the Court in great Indignation (<HI>Leofwyn</HI> I mean) and calling <HI>Gilbert</HI> aside, with little ado per∣suaded him to carry a certain Number of armed Men to the House where <HI>Leulfus</HI> lay, and in a Night to kill him; which indeed he performed with great Cruelty, murdering not only the innocent Gentleman himself, but also his Servants and whole Houshold. The News of this horrible and outragi∣ous Cruelty coming unto the Ears of the Bishop, amazed him very much, and suspecting it was done by the Advice of <HI>Leofwyn,</HI> turning about unto him: <HI>O</HI> Leofwyn, saith he, <HI>thou hast already slain me by thy Tongue.</HI> So not doubting it would breed much Danger unto him, he got into his Castle, and presently dispatched Messengers unto the Friends and Kindred of <HI>Leulfus</HI> that was slain, protesting, that the Fact was committed without his Knowledge; that he was marvellous sorry for it; and if any Man suspected him, would be ready to submit himself to any Order of Law, whereby he might clear him∣self. Herewith they seemed to be satisfied; but for Conclusion of a firm Peace amongst them, it was thought fit they should meet and consider of the Matter. They met at a Place called <HI>Goats-Head;</HI> the Bishop for his better Safe-guard betook himself unto the Church with his Company; the People (whereof an infinite Number were gathered together) abode without. Mes∣sages a while past between them; but the more the Matter was debated (be∣ing very odious of itself) the more the People were incensed. At last it was told them, how not only <HI>Leofwyn,</HI> but also <HI>Gilbert</HI> had been harboured in the Bishop's House, and afforded Countenance by him since the Murder; which being once heard (and it was true enough) they all cried out, it was mani∣fest that the Bishop was the Author of this Fact. It is furthermore delivered by <HI>Matthew Paris,</HI> that the Bishop not only before this, amongst many intol∣lerable Exactions laid upon the Country by him, had commanded the Sum of 400 <HI>l.</HI> to be levied at this Time. That being also remembred, while as all the People stood in a murmuring, doubting what Course to take, one of some special Regard amongst them slept up, using these Words, <HI>Short read, Good read, slay ye the Bishop.</HI> Hereupon, without more ado, they ran all unto the
<PB N="168" REF="179"/>
Church, killed so many of the <HI>Bishop</HI>'s Retinue as they found without Doors, and with horrible Noise and Outcries, bid him and his Company to come out unto them. Too late then he repented, that he had committed himself unto the Fury of a discontented Multitude, with whom he knew himself before that Time nothing gracious. But to make the best of a bad Match, and to try all Means of ridding himself from the Danger imminent, he persuaded his Kinsman <HI>Gilbert,</HI> there present, to go forth unto them, if happily his Death (which doubtless he had deserved) might satisfy their Fury, and purchase Safety unto his Lord and Master. <HI>Gilbert</HI> was content, and issuing out, with divers of the Bishop's Company, were all slain, except only two <HI>Englishmen,</HI> Servants unto the <HI>Bishop</HI> (all the rest were <HI>Normans</HI>). They being not yet satisfied, he besought <HI>Leofwyn</HI> (whose Life he knew well was principally sought) to go out also. But he utterly refused so to do. The Bishop there∣fore going unto the Church-door, entreated them not to take his Life from him, protesting himself to be utterly guiltless of the Blood of <HI>Leulfus;</HI> and shewed them at large, how dangerous it would be to them in particular, and what Inconvenience would follow to the whole Country in general, if they should defile their Hands in shedding his Blood, an unarmed Priest, a sacred and consecrated Bishop, their Ruler, their Governor, their Magistrate. Hoping, <HI>Lastly,</HI> That his very Countenance, his Gravity, his Age, and the Sight of his Person might move them to Compassion (for he was indeed a very reve∣rend Man to see to, very tall of Stature, Head and Beard as white as Snow, his Face fresh and well coloured, and every Way very personable, he went out, carrying a green Branch in his Hand, that so he might testify his Desire of Peace. When he saw that all this availed not, and the People ran furiously upon him, he cast his Gown over his own Head, in like Sort as we read <HI>Ju∣lius Caesar</HI> did in the like Case, and permitting himself to their Fury, with in∣numerable Wounds was pitifully massacred, together with all his People and Retinue, to the Number of an hundred; only <HI>Leofwyn</HI> yet remained within the Church, and being often called, would not come forth; so they set the Church on Fire. Not enduring the Fire, he leaped out of a Window, and was immediately hewn into a thousand Pieces. The Monks of <HI>Yarrow</HI> came and fetched away the Bishop's Body (which they found stark naked) and could hardly know it for the Multitude of Wounds; they carried it to their Monastery, from whence it was conveyed to <HI>Durham,</HI> and there buried on the South-side of the Chapter-house, but secretly, for Fear of the Murderers, that roved up and down the Town, and once assaulted the Castle. When they found that they could not prevail there, they dispersed themselves, and for the most Part came to evil and unhappy Ends. The King in the mean Time hearing of this Tumult, sent his Brother <HI>Odo</HI> Bishop of <HI>Bayan,</HI> with many of his Nobles, and a great Army, to take Punishment of this Murder, which while they sought to revenge, they brought the whole Country to Desolation. Those that were guilty prevented the Danger toward them by Flight, so as few of them could be taken; of the rest that stayed at Home, some were unjustly executed, and the rest compelled to ransom themselves to their utter impoverishing and undoing. The chiefest Doer in this Outrage, was one <HI>Eadulsus,</HI> sirnamed <HI>Rus,</HI> descended of the Earls of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> who (as some say) slew the Bishop with his own Hands, and afterwards by the just Judgment of God, was himself slain by a Woman, and his Body, tho' once buried in the Church of <HI>Godworth,</HI> was taken up by the Command∣ment of <HI>Turgost,</HI> Prior of <HI>Durham,</HI> and forbidden Christian Burial. At this Time <HI>Odo</HI> took away from the Church of <HI>Durham</HI> certain Ornaments of great Value, amongst which is especially remembred a certain Crosier of inestimable Price. In this Bishop's Days, and by his Endeavour, secular Clerks were dis∣placed, and the Church of <HI>Durham</HI> replenished with Monks, the Pope, the King, and the Archbishop allowing this Alteration, <HI>Goodwyn, Fol.</HI> 637.</P>
<P>AFTERWARDS this Church was new built, and placed where it now stands: For, according to Tradition, it stood before in the Field below where Brick-Kilns now are.</P>

<P><HI>PHILIP</HI> Bishop of <HI>Durham,</HI> in the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> II. granted to the Burgesses of <HI>Gateshead</HI> several Privileges, as appears by what follows.</P>
<P><HI>PHILIP</HI> by the Grace of God Bishop of <HI>Durham,</HI> to all Men of the whole Bishoprick, and of his Brotherhood in all <HI>England,</HI> he saluteth.</P>
<P>Know ye, that we have granted, and by his present Deed have granted to our Burgesses of <HI>Gatesheved,</HI> full Liberty of Forestage, yielding in every half Year, from <HI>Pentecost</HI> to the Feast of St. <HI>Martin;</HI> for a Wheye or Ox, the which goes to Grass, 2 <HI>d.</HI> and for a Horse 2 <HI>d.</HI> and for every Hog 1 <HI>d.</HI> in re∣spect of all Things that they have to proper and necessary Uses; saving these prohibited. Neither shall it be lawful for any Forester within the Meats that are appointed within our Forest and Burrough to Tax Lands upon any Burgess, or upon any Manner of Thing of the said Borough, or upon any Oxen, or any other their Cattle, or by any Ways to hinder them, either of their Wood, Tim∣ber, or any other Things. And if any Suit or Trouble shall be between the Foresters and Burgesses, it shall be determined in the said Burrough, if it may be; if not, then in our Presence it shall be determined. And the Cattle of any Burgess shall not be carried out of the said Burrough, but there shall be reple∣vied, if the same may be replevied. To the same Burgesses it shall be lawful to have Herbage, and lying Turfs and Bruery to their own proper Uses, where∣soever they are accustomed to have the same, so that they sell us Part thereof. And if any Burgess do dig Turfs for his Chimney, not having Oxen; if for the Leading of Turfs they shall be forced to have Oxen, nevertheless in giving for all or every Ox, which they shall need 2 <HI>d.</HI> of Forestage, they shall be freed. And it shall be lawful for every Burgess to give Wood to whomsoever he will,
<PB N="172" REF="183"/>
to be spent about the River of <HI>Tyne,</HI> without any Licence; but not to sell any without Licence of the Foresters. And no Forester shall disturb any Mer∣chandize that cometh within the said Meat. And every Burgess of <HI>Gatesheved</HI> shall have of his Burgage the same Liberty, which the Burgesses of <HI>Newcastle</HI> have of their Burgages. And whithersoever the Burgesses of <HI>Gatesheved,</HI> or their Cattle, shall come within our Land, in the Peace of God and Blessed St. <HI>Cuthbert,</HI> they shall pass, that no Man to them shall do any Injury, or any De∣mand or Exaction of them shall require. We do grant also to the same Bur∣gesses, that they shall have Common of Pasture and like Parts of Feeding to all their Houses, and all Commodities which they ought to have of <HI>Subtwell Meadows,</HI> as they were wont to have; as in Deeds of good Memory of our Predecessors reasonably is contain'd.</P>
<P>IN the 7th of <HI>Edward</HI> VI. the Mayor and Burgesses of <HI>Newcastle</HI> peti∣tioned the King, that the Town of <HI>Gatesheved</HI> in the County of <HI>Durham,</HI> ad∣joining to their Corporation, only the River of <HI>Tyne</HI> between, being popu∣lous, and without Government, and often committing many Outrages in their Town, and then got over the Water into the Town of <HI>Gatesheved</HI> unpunished; and that often they cast Rubbish into the River; and also that the Bridge went to Decay very much, which belonged to that Town; humbly beseech∣ing, That his Majesty would be graciously pleased, to incorporate that Town with them, under their Government, with all its Members, and Salt-mea∣dows, and Park; and that it might be quite taken from the County of <HI>Dur∣ham,</HI> and all the People therein to become subordinate to their Laws.</P>
<P>WHEREUPON it was enacted, the whole Town of <HI>Gatesheved,</HI> with the Salt-Meadows, the whole Water and Bridge, with all the Liberties there∣unto belonging (except the Common which should remain to the Inhabi∣tants) should be incorporated with <HI>Newcastle,</HI> and disjoined from the County of <HI>Durham,</HI> as <HI>Newcastle</HI> was from <HI>Northumberland</HI> by Charter, <HI>Gardener,</HI> p. 169.</P>
<P>FIRST <HI>Mary,</HI> so soon as Bishop <HI>Tunstal</HI> was created Bishop of <HI>Durham,</HI> he petitioned her Majesty, to restore <HI>Gatesheved</HI> to the County of <HI>Durham</HI> again, and that the said Act 7th <HI>Edward</HI> VI. might be repealed; and it was repealed accordingly, and enacted, that the Town of <HI>Gatesheved</HI> should be free from the Corporation of <HI>Newcastle, &amp;c. Gardener,</HI> p. 175.</P>
<P>ON the same Side of the <HI>Tyne,</HI> a little below, are the Fields called the <HI>Salt-Meadows.</HI></P>
<P>IN going down the Water, we meet with several Staiths, such are the Staith of <HI>Richard Ridley,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> and <HI>Matthew White,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> at the Glass-House Bridge; the Staiths of <HI>Richard Ridley,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> at St. <HI>Lawrence</HI> and St. <HI>Peter</HI>'s Keys, of <HI>Walter Blacket,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> and Mr. <HI>John Wilkinson;</HI> of <HI>Francis Rudston,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> and of <HI>Edward Wortley Montague,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> We meet also with several Keys, such are <HI>Winkemley, Bill-Key, Willington-Key, Hebbourn-Key,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>WE meet also with several Villages, such are <HI>Dents-Hole,</HI> St. <HI>Anthon</HI>'s, <HI>Snowdon</HI>'s <HI>Hole, Howdon Panns, Jarroiv,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>WHEN the Hoastmen renewed their Charter, they had Licence to send Coals above the Bill, and Mr. <HI>Coal</HI> procured a Shore at <HI>Friar-Goose,</HI> Mr. <HI>Hen∣ry Chapman</HI> procured a Shore upon <HI>Hewith</HI>-Grounds; and Mr. <HI>Robert Brand∣ling</HI> with much ado got Leave to build a Shore upon his own Ground at <HI>Fel∣lin.</HI> In the mean time, the Tenants of the Dean and Chapter at <HI>Durham,</HI> took Liberty to throw their Ashes into the River, which did much Damage to the Bar. Upon this Mr. <HI>Leonard Carr,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Cuthbert Bewick</HI> com∣plained, and the Town caused them to lay them upon the Land, of which they have made mighty Heaps.</P>
<P><PB N="173" REF="184"/>WHEN King <HI>James</HI> I. came to the Crown, he was pleased to be bounti∣ful to his Countrymen; amongst the rest, Sir <HI>Henry Gibb</HI> being one of his Officers, he bestowed upon him the Lordship of <HI>Jarrow</HI> and he would have procured a Shore there to cast Ballast; but altho' he had the Favour of the King, yet the Town used such Means, and gave such Reasons to his Majesty and the Council, that they found it detrimental to the Town, and espe∣cially to the River, so that he was utterly hindred and disappointed.</P>
<P>BUT after the Death of King <HI>Charles</HI> I. <HI>Thomas Bonner,</HI> and <HI>Robert Elli∣son</HI> got in to be Magistrates; and these Men having gotten Wealth and Increase by the Rebellion, did purchase <HI>Jarrow;</HI> and what could not be done before in a lawful Time, they did bring to pass at this unlawful Juncture, building a Shore, and casting Ballast, to the great Detriment of the River: And hav∣ing the Town at Command, Mr. <HI>Bonner</HI> bought St. <HI>Anthony</HI>'s, and <HI>Robert Ellison</HI> bought <HI>Hebbourn,</HI> and there they both built Shores, and got the Allowance of the Common Council, when they were beyond Resisting: And since that, Mr. <HI>Carr,</HI> a Man that deserved well of his present Maje∣sty [<HI>CHARLES</HI> II.] and the Town, hath procured, that his Brother <HI>Ellison</HI> (for old <HI>Ellison</HI>'s Son married his Sister) should have Liberty to e∣rect his Shore to a great Length, which in Time will utterly overthrow our Navigation; for they will damn out the In-draught, which maketh Rivers far off the Sea be walled out; it will go by, and not come in: And some ancient and discreet Masters of Ships have said, <HI>They have not left a Birth to save their Ships in, when any Land-stood or Storm happens in the River.</HI> Mil∣bank.</P>
<P>THE next Place <HI>Jarrow,</HI> or <HI>Girwy,</HI> as it was anciently called, which is a small Village on the South Side of <HI>Tyne,</HI> about 4 Miles distant from <HI>Newca∣stle,</HI> famous for a Monastery of learned Men, but more so for the Birth, Life, and Death of <HI>venerable BEDE;</HI> so named for his singular Sanctity, who was born of mean Parents, and at seven Years of Age deliver'd to the holy Abbot St. <HI>Benedict</HI> to be educated in his Rule, and being come to Age he professed a Monastick Life in the Abbies of <HI>Weremouth,</HI> and <HI>Girwy,</HI> where he became by his constant Application to his Studies, so compleat a Scholar, that few in that Age, (which bred many very learned Men) were to compare to him, for he was perfectly knowing in the Greek and Latin Tongues, and no less perfect in Poetry, Rhetorick, Logick, Physicks, Metaphysikcs, Astronomy, Arithmetick, all Ecclesiastical Calculations, Musick, Geometry, Cosmogra∣phy, History, Philosophy, and Divinity. In short, he had an exact Know∣ledge of all commendable Sciences, insomuch that <HI>William of Malmsbury</HI> thus describes him. He was a Man that may more worthily be admired than com∣mended; for he was born in an extream Corner of the World, yet the Light of his Learning spread over all Parts of the Earth, he continued a most dili∣gent Learner 'till he was thirty Years of Age, after which being ordained Priest, he betook himself to Teaching and Writing. All the Hours he had to spare from the Monastical Excerises of Prayer, and Singing in the Choirs by Day and Night (in which he was constant and very devout) he most dili∣gently spent in his Studies, so that his Life was a continual Intercourse be∣tween Devotion and Study, he never repairing to his Study 'till he had been at Prayers, nor ever went to Prayers but from his Studies, by which continual Application he penetrated into all Sciences. In his continual Deportment he was so grave and serious, that the Title of <HI>Venerable</HI> was bestowed on him while he lived, and ever continued to him after his Death. It appears from History that he had at one Time those great Lights of the Church, <HI>Alcuinus,</HI> Preceptor to the Emperor <HI>Charlemaign,</HI> and <HI>Claudius</HI> and <HI>Clemens,</HI> the Foun∣ders of the Universities of <HI>Paris</HI> and <HI>Pavia</HI> for his Scholars.</P>
<P>THIS Character is fully verified by the Books of all Sorts of Learning writ by him. At the End of his Works he gives us a modest account of his own
<PB N="174" REF="185"/>
Life, together with a Catalogue of his Principal Works. <HI>Henry</HI> of <HI>Hunting∣ton</HI> gives us also a large Catalogue of his Writings, too long to be set down here: Yet we cannot omit some of the Principal Works, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>AN incredible Number of Treatises upon all Parts of the Old and New Testament, many of which are still to be found in the <HI>Bodleian</HI> Library at <HI>Oxford.</HI></P>
<P>ABOVE an hundred Homilies, and many Pieces of Divinity and Devotion.</P>
<P>A Small Book of the Holy-Land.</P>
<P>A Chronicle from the Creation.</P>
<P>A Book of the Writers of the Church.</P>
<P>A Martyrology.</P>
<P>AN Epitome of the English History.</P>
<P>OF the Scituation and wonderful Things of <HI>Great Britain.</HI></P>
<P>THE Lives of many holy Men and Abbots, with many others of all Sorts of Learning.</P>
<P>THIS most excellent Person, being grown old in the Study of Learning, and all Christian Virtues, grew weak and decripit for a Time, and at length on the Tuesday before <HI>Ascension,</HI> his Distemper grew so heavy upon him, that Nature yielded to it, and he died on <HI>Ascension</HI> Day, in the seventy second Year of his Age; But others say the Ninetieth, <HI>Anno</HI> 734, and was buried in his Monastery, but afterwards his Body was translated to <HI>Durham. Magn' Brit' vol 3d,</HI> p. 750.</P>
<P>NOR is it to be admired that he should become so learned in his Monastery, for in former Ages the greater Monasteries were like Universities, wherein not only Humanity, but all the Liberal Sciences, Philosophy, and Divinity were taught; in the Year 697, he received Deacons Orders from the Hands of <HI>John</HI> Bishop of <HI>Hexham</HI> afterwards called St. <HI>John</HI> of <HI>Beverley,</HI> and in the Year 706 he was ordained Priest by the same Bishop.</P>
<P>AMONG the several Ways of accounting for his Epithet of <HI>Venerable,</HI> it has always been esteemed the most pleasing, though perhaps not the most true Account, of what is said to have happened after his Death, <HI>viz.</HI> that one of his Scholars designing to make his Epitaph in Hexameter Verse, which began thus, <HI>Hac sunt in Fossa,</HI> and was willing to make it end <HI>Presbiteri ossa;</HI> But it would not do, at last being tired out he fell asleep, and in the Morning to his great Surprize he found it stand thus,
<Q><L><HI>Hac sunt in Fossa,</HI> Bedae <HI>venerabilis Ossa.</HI></L></Q>
<Q><L>Here lies entomb'd within these Stones,</L>
<L>Of Venerable <HI>Bede</HI> the Bones.</L></Q></P>

<P>NOW the great Churches when the saving Light of the Gospel began to Shine abroad in the World (for it is not impertinent to note thus much) were called <HI>Basilicae,</HI> because the <HI>Basilicae</HI> of the Gentiles, namely those state∣ly Buildings where the Magistrates held the Courts of Justice, were converted to Churches by the Christians; whence <HI>Ausonius, Basilica olim negotiis plena, nunc votis,</HI> i. e. the <HI>Basilica</HI> full of Business heretofore, but now of De∣votion or else, because they were built in an oblong Form as the <HI>Basilicae</HI> were.</P>
<P>IN the Inscription the XUI should be XU. for King <HI>Elfrid</HI> reigned no more than 15 Years; and so (indeed) Sir <HI>James Ware</HI> has given it in his Notes upon <HI>Bede</HI>'s History of the <HI>Abbots</HI> of <HI>Weremouth.</HI> But it ought not from this Inscription to be inferred that <HI>Ceolfrid</HI> was the Founder of this Monastry, since it appears from <HI>Bede</HI>'s Account, that he was only constituted first Abbot of the Place by <HI>Benedictus Biscopus</HI> who sent him hither (with a Colony of Se∣venteen Monks) from <HI>Weremouth. Cambden</HI>'s <HI>Britan'</HI> p. 780 and 784.</P>
<P>IN this Church is to be seen a very ancient Chair which (Tradition says) was the Chair of <HI>venerable Bede.</HI></P>

<P>SOME Years ago, upon the Banks of the <HI>Tyne</HI> was discovered a Roman Altar, the Figure and Description whereof take here as it was delivered to the Royal Society, by the ingenious and learned Dr. <HI>Lister.</HI></P>

<P>I have, says he, in his Letter to the Royal Society, with much Trouble, got into my Hands a Piece of <HI>Roman</HI> Antiquity, which was but a very few Years ago discovered upon the South-bank of the River <HI>Tyne,</HI> near <HI>Sheilds,</HI> in the Bishoprick; it is a very large and fair <HI>Roman</HI> Altar, of one intire Stone; but after all my Cost and Pains, I am very sorry to find the Inscription very ill defaced, and much of it is not legible, and I believe it has been also much mishandled by those who have endeavoured to read it; whereas if the Remain∣der of the Letters had been exactly measured, and the Face blacked, and light∣ly washed off again, as in Prints, some Things more might have been spelled.</P>
<P>As to the Nature of the Stone itself, it is of a coarse Rag, the same with that of the Pyramids at <HI>Burrow-Briggs;</HI> it is four Foot high, and was ascended to by Steps, which appeareth in all the Sides; but the Front has two Square-holes near the Bottom, which let in the Irons that joined it to the Steps.</P>
<P>I have carefully designed it on all its Sides, and given the Plan of the Top also, which if you please, we will survey in Order.</P>
<P N="1">1. THE Back-side, opposite to the Inscription, on which is engraven in Bass-Relief, a Flower-Pot, furnished I suppose, with what best pleased the
<PB N="177" REF="188"/>
Stone-Cutter; for these Men needed not be more curious than the Priests themselves, who were wont to make Use of Herbs next Hand, to adorn the Altars, and therefore <HI>Verbenae</HI> is put for any Kind of Herb; yet if we will have it resemble any Thing with us, I think it is most like, if not truly <HI>Nym∣phaea,</HI> a known and common River Plant.</P>
<P N="2">2. ONE of the Sides; which is somewhat narrower than the Front or Back, On this are engraved in Bass-Relief, the cutting Knife <HI>(Cecespita)</HI> and the Ax <HI>(securis);</HI> the Knife is exactly the same with that on the other Altar, formerly by me mentioned in the Philosophical Collections of Mr. <HI>Hook;</HI> but the Ax is different, for here it is headed with a long and crooked Point, and there the Head of the Ax is divided into three Points.</P>
<P N="3">3. The other Side, on which are engraved after the same Manner, an Eure <HI>(Urceolus)</HI> and a Ladle which serves for a <HI>Sympullum.</HI> This I call rather a Laddle than a Mallet, it being perfectly Dish-wife, and hollow in the Middle, altho' <HI>Cambden</HI> is of another Opinion in that elegant Sculpt of the <HI>Cumberland</HI> Altar; and the very same Utensil I have seen and noted on the <HI>Ickley</HI> Altar, which is yet extant at <HI>Middleton-Grange,</HI> near that Town; but the Stone which <HI>Cambden</HI> says supports a Pair of Stairs there (as at this Day it does in the very Road) is but an ill Copy of it, and not the Original.</P>
<P N="4">4. THE Plan of the Top, which is cut in the Figure of a Bason (<HI>Disons</HI> or <HI>Lana</HI>) with <HI>Ansae</HI> on each Side, consisting of a Pair of Links of a Chain, which rest upon, and fall over two Rowles; and this was the Hearth.</P>
<P N="5">5. THE Front, which hath an Inscription in nine Lines in <HI>Roman</HI> Letters, each Letter a little more than two Inches deep of our Measure, now remain∣ing as in the prefixed Sculpture, Fig. 5. which I would read thus: <HI>Dis, De∣abusque Matribus, pro Salute M. Aurelii Antonii Augusti Imperatoris votum sol∣vit lubens merito ob reditum.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Deae Matres</HI> are well interpreted by <HI>Seldon.</HI> It is much his Safety and Return both vowed, should be so separated in the Inscription; but I have not <HI>Gruter</HI> by me, to compare this with the like. <HI>Caracalla</HI> say the Histo∣rians, <NOTE N="l" PLACE="marg">Ziphilinus, Herodianus, &amp;c.</NOTE> after his Father's Death at <HI>York,</HI> took upon him the Command of the Army alone, and the whole Empire; he went alone against the Enemy, who were the <HI>Caledonii,</HI> inhabiting beyond the Wall which his Father had built, he made Peace with them, received their Hostages, slighted their fortified Places, and returned. And this seems to be confirmed by the Inscription; for undoubtedly, upon this last Expedition alone, without his Brother <HI>Gera</HI> and Mother, was this Altar erected to him alone, at a Place about two Sta∣tions on this Side the Wall; so that the Vow might be as well understood of his Return from this Expedition, as for his Sasety and Return to <HI>Rome,</HI> which methinks should be true, or his Mother and Brother <HI>Geta</HI> would scarce have been left out, at least so early, for yet the Army declared for them both, according to their Father's Will.</P>
<P>FURTHER, it seems also to have been erected by those who flattered him, and who were afterwards killed by him; and for this Reason, the Per∣sons who dedicated it, seem to me to be Purposely defaced, the sixth and seventh Lines of the Inscription being designedly cut away by the Hollowness of them, and there not being the least Sign of any Letter remaining. And this I sup∣pose might be Part of their Disgrace, as it was usual to deface and break the Statues and Monuments of Persons executed, of which this Monster made strange Havock; and since worn Inscriptions admit of various Readings, be∣cause some Letters are worn out, and some more legible, whereby unpreju∣diced People may conceive them diversly; I will therefore tell you another reading, Part of these two first Lines, which I do not disallow, but that it will agree well enough with the History of <HI>Severus,</HI> tho' his <HI>Apotheosis,</HI> or so∣lemn
<PB N="178" REF="189"/>
Dedication was not performed till he came to <HI>Rome,</HI> in the Manner of which funeral Pomp <HI>Herodian</HI> is very large; it was of that excellent Antiqua∣ry Dr. <HI>Johnson</HI> of <HI>Pomfret.</HI></P>
<Q>CONSERVATO RI. B. PRO SAL. <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q>
<P>Which shews the Height of Flattery of those Times; so that they paid their Vows to the lately dead Father the Conservator of <HI>Britain,</HI> for the Safety of the Son: And the Story tells us, how gladly he would have had him made a God long before, even with his own Hands. <HI>Cambden Britan.</HI> in the Addi∣tions to <HI>Durham,</HI> p. 784.</P>
<P>BELOW this are the Towns of <HI>Shields,</HI> one on the <HI>North</HI> Side of the Ri∣ver, and the other on the South. That on the <HI>North</HI> Side in the Reign of <HI>Ed∣ward</HI> the 1st, (when the Contest was between the Town of <HI>Newcastle,</HI> and the Prior of <HI>Tinmouth</HI>) was a Place where only 5 or 6 Fisherman had their Cottages, and it's but of late Years that it became a large Town and so popu∣lous. The Church-belonging to this Place was begun to be built in 1659.</P>
<P>SOUTH <HI>Shields</HI> is more famous for making Salt than North <HI>Shields,</HI> there being much the greater Number of Salt Pans; it is also a pretty large Town, and has a Church which going to decay, is about to be rebuilt. It is a Cha∣pelry to <HI>Jarrow,</HI> and dedicated to St. <HI>Hilda.</HI></P>
<P>WE come now to the Mouth of the River <HI>Tyne,</HI> which is a Haven so deep as to carry Vessels of a considerable Burthen, and of that Security, that they are not in Danger either of Storms or Shallows, save that within less than half a Mile of the Bar of <HI>Tinmouth,</HI> (which is a Sand that lies cross the River's Mouth, not above 7 Foot deep at Low-Water) you meet with many Rocks which are called by the Sailors the <HI>Black Middens,</HI> which are very dangerous, but to prevent any Mischiefs which may happen to them in the Night Time, there are two Light-houses, maintained by the <HI>Trinity-house</HI> in <HI>Newcastle,</HI> and near them in the Year 1672, was built a Fort, called <HI>Clifford</HI>'s <HI>-Fort,</HI> which effe∣ctually commands all the Vessels that enter the River.</P>
<P><HI>LELAND</HI> in the 4th Volume of his Collections, gives us the following most valuable Remark of a Roman Station on the South Side of the <HI>Tyne,</HI> the Place of the Birth of King <HI>Oswyn,</HI> for says he.</P>
<P><HI>E Regione Tinemuthae suit Urbs vastata a</HI> Danis <HI>Ursa nomine, Ubi natus erat</HI> Oswinus <HI>Rex.</HI></P>
<P><HI>TINMOUTH</HI> called by the <HI>Britains, Pen Ball Cragg. i. e.</HI> the Head of the Rampire upon the Rock, from whence some maintain, that the Ditch reached as far as this Place, if the Wall did not; Mr. <HI>Cambden</HI> says, that he will not gainsay this Opinion, but adds, that he dares confidently Affirm, that this Place in the Time of the <HI>Romans</HI> was called <HI>Tunacellum,</HI> which signifies as much as the Promontory of <HI>Tuna</HI> or <HI>Tina,</HI> where the first Cohort (called <HI>Aelia Classica,</HI> because it was first raised by <HI>Aelius Hadrianus,</HI> as the Name seems to import) was in pay for Sea Service; for the <HI>Romans</HI> had their <HI>Naves Lusoriae,</HI> or light Frigates in their border Rivers both for the suppressing the Excursions of the neighbouring Enemy, and making Incursions upon him, as may be seen in the <HI>Codex Theodosii,</HI> under the Title <HI>De Lusoriis Danubii, i. e.</HI> Light Vessels on the <HI>Danube.</HI></P>
<P>UNDER the <HI>Saxon</HI> Heptarchy this Place was called <HI>Tunaceltep,</HI> not as <HI>Bede</HI> affirms, from the Abbot <HI>Tunna,</HI> a mere romantick Story, which, if we recommend to the Reader, it must be only for his Diversion, and not for any Truth in it, but from it's Situation on the River <HI>Tyne.</HI> Here was anciently
<PB N="179" REF="190"/>
a little Monastery, which was frequently plundered by the <HI>Danes,</HI> while the <HI>Saxons</HI> ruled. <HI>Magn. Britan. p.</HI> 693.</P>
<P>AFTER the Decease of <HI>Oswyn,</HI> those that had killed him brought his Bo∣dy to the Mouth of the River <HI>Tyne,</HI> and there buried it in the Oratory of St. <HI>Mary</HI>'s, in the Year 631.</P>
<P>IN this Place a Number of illustrious Persons had gathered together, who in a regular Order attended divine Worship; who thereby acquired such Ho∣nour and Esteem, that when any one died of more than ordinary Reputation, whose Funeral was to be solemnized with more than common Honour, he was usually buried here.</P>
<P>THIS Monastery was destroyed by <HI>Hinguar</HI> and <HI>Hubba.</HI> The Monks through Fear of Persecution, fled to a certain little Church of their own, which St. <HI>Cuthbert</HI> had dedicated; but the <HI>Danes</HI> finding them out, burnt it and all that were in it.</P>
<P>AFTER that <HI>William</HI> the Conqueror had given to <HI>Robert Mowbray</HI> the County of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> the Earl shewed a deal of Respect to St. <HI>Oswyn,</HI> and the Church he was buried in (for the Church was founded within the Precincts of his Castle). He gifted it with a Number of Lands, and placed in it Monks which came from St. <HI>Albans,</HI> and yet it is said by some that <HI>Tosti</HI> Earl of <HI>Northumberland</HI> laid the Foundation of this Monastery; but it's much more probable it was the former, because he brought the Monks from St. <HI>Albans;</HI> but it will appear a great deal more likely when we come to the following Grant or Charter of <HI>William Rufus,</HI> for making of it a Cell to <NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg"><P>Willielmus Rex Anglo∣rum T.

<P>KING <HI>Henry</HI> I. confirmed all that had been given to this Monastery, that is, what had been given by <HI>Robert Mowbray,</HI> namely, the Tythes of <HI>Colebridge, Ovington, Wylam, Newburn, Dissington, Calverdon, Elstwye, Bothall, Werk∣worth, Anebell, Roubyr,</HI> and <HI>Wullour.</HI></P>
<P><HI>DAVID</HI> King of <HI>Scots</HI> in a Charter dated in the Year 1138, granted to the Church of St. <HI>Mary</HI> and St. <HI>Oswyn,</HI> the Martyr of <HI>Tynemouth,</HI> and all be∣longing thereto his Peace for ever, the Peace of his Son, and that of all his Ser∣vants, threatning all those who should act otherwise with the Loss of his Fa∣vour for ever; on Condition the Religious of this Monastery prayed for the Souls of his Father and Mother, and of King <HI>Alexander</HI> his Brother, who to this Church had granted a firm Peace, and for the Soul of <HI>Matilda</HI> Queen of <HI>England,</HI> his Sister, and for the Souls of all his Ancestors and Successors.</P>
<P>KING <HI>Henry</HI> II. gave to it <HI>Egleringham, Bewick</HI> and <HI>Lilleburn.</HI></P>
<P>KING <HI>John</HI> confirmed to this Church all their Possessions, being the Town of <HI>Tinmouth, Seaton, Preston, Chirton,</HI> and another <HI>Chirton, Millington, Whitley, Erdeston, Backwell,</HI> and another <HI>Backwell, Seghal, Morton, Bebesete, Disslington,</HI> and another <HI>Disslington, Wulsington, Bewick, Egelingham, Lilleburn, Anibel, Hovekslaw, Estwick, Wylum, Weltedane,</HI> and Half the Town of <HI>Cop∣un, Carleberry,</HI> and <HI>Morton</HI> in <HI>Haliwerkstock,</HI> and the Land of <HI>Royely,</HI> and <HI>De∣muni;</HI> also the Churches of <HI>Tinmouth, Wodeburn, Whalton, Bolum, Bewick, Egelingham, Kertburn,</HI> and <HI>Cunesline;</HI> likewise <HI>Hereford</HI> upon <HI>Blyth,</HI> and the Tithe of <HI>Hyrenes, Middleton</HI> upon <HI>Theyse, Corbigg, Rouber, Werkewuril, Wol∣lour,</HI> and <HI>Newburn,</HI> with all the Mills.</P>

The Charter of King <HI>Edward</HI> III. restores and confirms to this Mo∣nastery all its Privileges, Immunities, and Possessions. <HI>Dugdale</HI> p. 42.</P>
<P>THIS Monastery being afterwards fortified, and turned into a strong Hold, was called <HI>Tinmouth</HI>-Castle; which Name it still bears, and as such, glories both of its Stateliness and Strength; (for as an ancient Author speaks) it is inaccessibly seated upon a very high Rock towards the Ocean on the East and North, and elsewhere, so well mounted, that a slender Garrison may make it good. For this Reason, <HI>Robert Mowbray,</HI> Earl of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> when he practised with certain Noblemen to dethrone <HI>William Rufus</HI> (because he had not rewarded him according to his Expectation, for slaying <HI>Malcom</HI> King of <HI>Scots,</HI> and his Son) but was set upon by the King before Things were ripe for Rebellion, chose this Castle for his chief Hold, and maintained it for some Time against the King and his Forces; but being at length brought into great Straits by the Besiegers (as Rebels seldom meet with Success) he fled, and betook himself to the adjoining Monastery, which was accordingly com∣monly reputed an holy and inviolable Sanctuary; nevertheless he was carried off thence, and afterwards, in a long and noisome Imprisonment, justly suf∣fered Death for his Treason. <HI>Magn. Britan.</HI> Vol. 3. p. 694.</P>
<P>JOHN of <HI>Whethamstede,</HI> thirty third Abbot of St. <HI>Albans,</HI> was so called from the Place of his Birth, a Village near St. <HI>Albans;</HI> but the Name of his Fa∣mily was <HI>Bostock;</HI> he was a Monk of the Priory of <HI>Tinmouth,</HI> and gave, after he came to be Abbot, a Chalice of pure Gold, and of great Weight, to that Priory; his Character can't be better drawn up, than in <HI>Stephen</HI>'s Monasti∣con, from whence we have this Account:
<Q><L>Contegit iste lapis venerabilis ossa <HI>Joannis</HI></L>
<L><HI>Wethamstede,</HI> Abbas hic qui fuit ejus in annis,</L>
<L>Ter doctus, doctos &amp; amans, &amp;c.</L></Q>
That is: <HI>This Stone covers the Bones of the Venerable</HI> John Wethamstede, <HI>who was Abbot here in his Time, most learned, a Lover of learned Men, and kind to them.</HI> He did not connive at any Faults in the Clergy; he was as zealous as <HI>Phineas</HI> against lewd Persons, and as <HI>John</HI> against Adulterers, and even as <HI>Pe∣ter</HI> against Simoniacks. He was so great a Repairer of old tatter'd Houses and Marks, that none past exceeded him in that Particular, or is there any equal to him. He is recorded to have left behind him Ten thousand Marks clear. Do you the Convent of St. <HI>Albans</HI> hourly pray for the Soul of him that loved you.</P>
<P>THIS famous Monastery, which was of the <HI>Benedictines</HI> Order, and con∣sisted of a Prior and fifteen Monks, was suppress'd <HI>Jan.</HI> 12th, in the 30th <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. It was valued at 397 <HI>l.</HI> 10 <HI>s.</HI> 5 <HI>d. per annum.</HI></P>
<P>KING <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. converted the Castle into a Defence and Fortification against foreign Invasions.</P>
<P>THE Ruins of the Monastery are still to be seen in the Castle, near which also was the Parish-Church; but that being gone much to Decay, and the Parishioners in the late Civil Wars being often debarred of the Liberty of a free Resort to it, another was begun to be re-built in the Year 1659; and be∣ing afterwards finished, was consecrated by Bishop <HI>Cosins</HI> in the Year 1668. In the former Church we may suppose it was, where <HI>Malcom</HI> King of <HI>Scots,</HI> slain with his Son <HI>Edward</HI> Prince of <HI>Scotland,</HI> by <HI>Robert Mowbray</HI> Earl of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> was buried. This King <HI>Malcom</HI> had barbarously plundered and ravaged these Northern Parts five Times, once in <HI>Edward</HI> the Confes∣sor's Days, twice in the Conqueror's, and twice in <HI>William Rufus</HI>'s; in the last of which Invasions he met with his Fate, by that just Providence, who often retaliates Wrongs in the Place they are done, as he found; for he was killed in this Country, where he had slain and destroyed many: But King
<PB N="181" REF="192"/>
<HI>William</HI> did not prosecute his Revenge further, as he might have done with Success, but established his Son on his Throne, notwithstanding the Endea∣vours and Design of his Uncle <HI>Donald</HI> to deprive him of it, which he had done, had not King <HI>William</HI> aided him to obtain it.</P>
<P><HI>JOHN</HI> of <HI>Tinmouth</HI> was born in this Town, and is said to have been the Vicar of it, but afterwards became a <HI>Benedictine Monk</HI> in the Abbey of St. <HI>Albans;</HI> he was a most virtuous Person, and excellently learned, entirely ad∣dicted to the Study of the Holy Scriptures, and of sacred History. He ga∣thered the Lives and Actions of the Saints of <HI>England, Wales, Scotland</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> with great Judgment and indefatigable Labour, which Work he en∣tituled, <HI>Sanctilogium servorum Dei,</HI> i. e. <HI>The sacred History of the Servants of GOD.</HI> Nor did he deserve less Commendation for his Expositions of the Holy Scripture, in which he not only explains the literal Sense, but the mo∣ral, allegorical, and tropological; his Commentaries were upon all the Books from <HI>Genesis</HI> to the <HI>Kings</HI> inclusive. He wrote also other Books, as <HI>Church-Lessons, The Golden History,</HI> and a <HI>Supplement</HI> to the same, an <HI>Appendix</HI> to his <HI>Martyrology,</HI> &amp;c. He flourished about the Year 1366.</P>
<P>THE Church has perhaps been a Building of as much Art and Curiosity, as any one in the whole Kingdom; nay, when we behold it at present, in the Midst of Ruins, we are struck with Aw, and the utmost Veneration; whether it is a Reflection on the extensive Charity of ancient Days, the sur∣prizing Fineness of the Masonry, or whether there is something naturally moving in those ancient Remains; but so it is, that it never fails to command a solemn Aw, and a silent Commiseration.</P>
<P><HI>TINMOUTH</HI> at present is a pretty large Village, and is much resorted to in the Summer-Season, it having the Prior's Haven in it, which is a most convenient retired Place for Bathing.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XIV.</HI> Of the Government of the Town.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">W</SEG>HATEVER Government was in this Town in the Times of the <HI>Saxons</HI> and <HI>Danes;</HI> it is certain, after the Conquest it was governed by Bailiffs; for tho' the Ca∣stle had Privileges of its own, yet it left those of the Town as they were, and without any Damage, as shall by and by be shewn. In the mean Time let us consider a few Things relating to this Place.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">1066.</NOTE><HI>TOSTON,</HI> Earl of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> Son of the great Earl <HI>Godwin,</HI> and Brother of <HI>Harold,</HI> having by his great Cruelties and many Acts of Injustice highly exasperated the <HI>Northumbrians,</HI> they took up Arms against him, and expelled him <HI>Northumberland,</HI> in 1063, in the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the Confessor. <HI>Harold</HI> being ordered to go and chastize them, and restore his Brother, and understanding that they had no design of withdrawing their O∣bedience from the King, but only from an unjust and cruel Governour, who exercised over them a Tyrannical Power, he not only interceeded for their Pardon, but procur'd them <HI>Morkard,</HI> Son of <HI>Alfgar,</HI> Duke of <HI>Mercia,</HI> for their Governour. <HI>Toston,</HI> highly incensed at his Brother's Proceedings, and not having it in his Power to vent his Fury on him, he turned it on some of his Domesticks, whom he caused to be cut in Pieces, then to be barrel'd up, and sent to his Brother for a Present. After so barbarous an Action, not da∣ring to stay any longer in <HI>England,</HI> he retired into <HI>Flanders</HI> to Earl <HI>Baldwin</HI> his Father-in-law. Upon <HI>Harold</HI>'s being made King, after the Death of <HI>Ed∣ward, Toston,</HI> in 1066, with some Ships, probably given him by the Earl of <HI>Flanders,</HI> infested the <HI>English</HI> Coasts, and plunder'd the Isle of <HI>Wight.</HI> From whence he went and landed some Troops at <HI>Sandwich;</HI> but being inform'd the King was marching towards him, he set sail for the <HI>North,</HI> and entring the <HI>Humber</HI> with his little Fleet, he made a descent on <HI>Yorkshire,</HI> and committed vast Ravages. But <HI>Morkard</HI> coming upon him unawares, being then got into <HI>Lincolnshire,</HI> put his little Army to Flight, and compelled him to betake him∣self to his Ships: Being drove by contrary Winds on the Coasts of <HI>Norway,</HI> he applied himself to <HI>Harold Harfager</HI> King of that Country, and by many Arguments represented to him how easy it was to conquer <HI>England,</HI> and add that Crown to his own. The King of <HI>Norway,</HI> whose Ambition was easily persuaded by the other's Arguments, accompanied with Earl <HI>Toston,</HI> put to
<PB N="183" REF="194"/>
Sea with a Fleet of 500 Sail, and entered the <HI>Tyne.</HI> After having sack'd the Countries on both Sides the <HI>Tyne,</HI> they put to Sea, and entring the <HI>Humber,</HI> landed their Forces on the North Side, and ravag'd the Country with iriex∣pressible Cruelties. <HI>Harold</HI> march'd against them with all the Expedition pos∣sible, and came up with them at <HI>Stanford-bridge,</HI> on the River <HI>Derwent,</HI> a lit∣tle below <HI>York.</HI> Here a most bloody Battle was sought, which lasted from seven in the Morning 'till three in the Afternoon, wherein <HI>Harfager</HI> and <HI>Toston</HI> were both slain, and <HI>Harold</HI> obtain'd a compleat Victory. This Battle was fought <HI>October</HI> 5th, 1066, but nine Days before the Battle at <HI>Hastings. Vide Malmsbury</HI> and <HI>M. Paris.</HI></P>

Upon which he went out one Night with 30 <HI>Soldiers,</HI> but being betrayed by his own Men, was pursued and taken by the Garrison of <HI>Malvoisin,</HI> i. e. <HI>bad Neighbour,</HI> be∣ing a Fortress built by the King near <HI>Banborrough,</HI> and so called by him, be∣cause it took away all Possibility of throwing any Succours into the Castle.</P>
<P>IN this King's Reign, <HI>Malcolme</HI> III. King of <HI>Scotland,</HI> came to <HI>Gloucester</HI> to the King, to commune with him about sundry Matters, that related to the Peace of both Realms; but not being received and entertained in the pom∣pous Manner he expected; he returned into his own Nation in Displeasure, and immediately getting his Army together, entred <HI>England,</HI> and destroyed the Country as far as <HI>Alnwick</HI> Castle, which he besieged and so straightned, that it was upon the very Point of Surrendering; a Soldier having promi∣sed to deliver up the Keys upon the Top of his Spear, which while he pre∣tended to do, he stabbed the King with it. At the same Time <HI>Robert Mow∣bray,</HI> Earl of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> lay in Ambush for the Return of the <HI>Scots,</HI> who upon the Loss of their King, lest the Siege, and being going home∣ward fell into the Ambush, and were many of them slain, and amongst them <HI>Edward</HI> Prince of <HI>Scotland.</HI> Thus did Providence revenge upon King <HI>Mal∣colme,</HI> the many Ravages and Cruelties he had exercised upon the <HI>English,</HI> in this King's, his Father's, and the Confessor's Reign. He was buried at <HI>Tin∣mouth,</HI> and his Son by the Aid of <HI>William Rufus</HI> obtained his Throne. <HI>Magn' Britan. Vol.</HI> III. <HI>p.</HI> 623.</P>

<P>AFTER these Things, we meet with some Accounts of this Place; for we are told, that King <HI>Henry</HI> II. confirm'd their Estates to them, and ex∣empted them from Tolls and Duties: It is therefore a Mistake in some, who say, the Town had no Privileges till the Reign of King <HI>John.</HI> And besides, in the third of King <HI>John</HI>'s Reign, which was above ten Years before the Town had a Charter from that King, the Town had great Privileges; for the Men of <HI>Newcastle</HI> upon <HI>Tyne</HI> (as is mentioned in that Year in the great Roll of <HI>Northumberland</HI>) paid 100 Marks and 2 Palfreys: So having the Town in their Hands by the <HI>old Farm,</HI> to wit (as is there said) 50 <HI>l.</HI> and 10 <HI>s.</HI> of Increase, for Confirmation of their Liberties, which they had by the Charter of <HI>Henry</HI> the King's Father. <HI>De reb.

<CELL><NOTE PLACE="marg"><P><HI>After King</HI> Edward <HI>had declared War against</HI> Scotland, <HI>he advanced to</HI> Newcastle, <HI>and made it the chief Rendezvous of his Forces.</HI> Rapin. <HI>The Story at large is this. King</HI> John <HI>of</HI> Scotland <HI>having in Contempt of King</HI> Edward <HI>disseised</HI> Magdulph <HI>Earl of</HI> Fife, <HI>and imprison'd him;</HI> Magdulph <HI>complain'd to King</HI> Edward, <HI>who order'd King</HI> John <HI>to appear before him; but upon this Summons he appeared not. Upon this the King sent out a second Writ, ordering him to appear before him</HI> 15 <HI>Days after</HI> Michaelmas, <HI>which was obey'd. Being come before him, he seem'd not so sensible of the King's Su∣periority, as he had been before; which was judged a Contempt and Disobedience, and that three of his principal Castles in</HI> Scotland <HI>should be seized. But before the Pronunciation of the Sentence, He came before the King and his Council, and made Supplication to the King with his own Mouth; the King receiving this, with the Advice of his Council, and the Consent of</HI> Magdulph, <HI>granted his Prayer, and gave him Day untill his Parliament af∣ter Easter. But that Parliament was not holden that Day; however the Suit between the King of</HI> Scots <HI>and,</HI> Magdulph <HI>was continued, and prorogued to the next Parliament, which was summoned to be holden at St.</HI> Ed∣mund<HI>'s</HI>-Bury, <HI>on the Feast of St.</HI> Martin <HI>in the Winter, in the year</HI> 1295.</P>
<P><HI>The Day being come, the King was present, and</HI> Magdulph <HI>strenuously prosecuted his Plea. But the King of</HI> Scot∣land <HI>instead of appearing in Person, sent the Abbot of</HI> Abirbrothock, <HI>and other Noblemen of that Kingdom, with not only frivolous excuses, but to demand Satisfaction of King</HI> Edward <HI>for many and great Injuries, Oppressions, and Grievances, sustained by the</HI> Scots <HI>from his Subjects. King</HI> Edward <HI>'s Answer was, That for certain Cau∣ses he was coming toward the</HI> North Parts, <HI>and that the King of</HI> Scots <HI>should then have sufficient Recompence to his own Content. And then appointed him a Day to meet him at</HI> Newcastle <HI>upon</HI> Tyne, <HI>viz. The 1st day of</HI> March <HI>next following, and ordered the Abbot and those with him, to give Notice to their King that he should then personally appear. In the mean Time the King had certain Intelligence that the King of</HI> Scots <HI>with his Pre∣lates, Earls, Barons,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>had entred into a Confederacy with</HI> France; <HI>so that the King of</HI> England <HI>upon this Account also, toward the Time appointed prepared for his Journey to</HI> Newcastle, <HI>and sent before him the Abbot of</HI> Newminster <HI>and</HI> Wellebeck <HI>to the King of</HI> Scots, <HI>to give him Notice of the Adjournment and Time of his coming.</HI></P>
<P><HI>On the 1st of</HI> March, 1296, <HI>the King was at</HI> Newcastle, <HI>and staid there many Days, expecting the King of</HI> Scots; <HI>he came not; the King of</HI> England <HI>removed nearer to</HI> Scotland, <HI>and came to</HI> Bamburgh, <HI>where he also summon'd him and expected him: He neither came, nor sent to excuse himself, but returned the Homage and Fealty for Himself and all his Kingdom to King</HI> Edward, <HI>by an Instrument or Writing, and defied him. After this he summon'd him again, but he would not appear; nay instead of that they proceed to Arms, enter</HI> England, <HI>plunder, burn, waste, kill and destroy wherever they come.</HI></P>
<P><HI>To obviate these Insolencies, and chastise them according to their Deserts, King</HI> Edward <HI>entred</HI> Scotland <HI>on Wednesday in</HI> Easter <HI>Week, besieged and took</HI> Berwick Castle <HI>with a great Slaughter of the</HI> Scots; <HI>from thence he sent Part of his Army to reduce the Castle of</HI> Dunbarr, <HI>lately revolted, which was done, by the Death and Destruction of a great many</HI> Scots. <HI>Ten thousands,</HI> says my Author, <HI>seven Barons, an hundred Knights, and thirty one Esquires were taken in the Castle; the Army coming to relieve it, Twenty two thousand of them were slain. From thence King</HI> Edward <HI>marched to</HI> Edinburgh, <HI>which Castle he took in eight Days. From thence he marched to</HI> Sterlin, <HI>where the King of</HI> Scots, <HI>and many of his great Men, sent to beg his Mercy. He order'd them to meet him some few Days after at</HI> Brechin, <HI>where they submitted to his Mercy and Favour, without making any Terms or Conditions whatever.</HI></P>
<P><HI>This done, King</HI> Edward <HI>caused the Stone used by the Kings of</HI> Scotland <HI>as a Throne, to be brought to</HI> West∣minster, <HI>appointed</HI> John Warren <HI>Earl of</HI> Surrey <HI>and</HI> Sussex, <HI>Governour of</HI> Scotland, Hugh de Cressingham, <HI>Treasurer, and</HI> William Ormsby, <HI>Justiciary, sent King</HI> John Baliol <HI>to the Tower of</HI> London, <HI>where he was decently attended; and the Noblemen of</HI> Scotland, <HI>which he brought into</HI> England, <HI>were forbidden to pass the River</HI> Trent, <HI>under forfeiture of their Heads.</HI> Brady.

The great Earl of</HI> Lancaster, (<HI>Son of Prince</HI> Edmund, <HI>and Grandson of</HI> Henry III.) <HI>was chosen their General; who by common Consent sent to the King then at</HI>York, <HI>petitioning him either to deliver Earl</HI> Gaveston <HI>to them, or oblige him to quit the Kingdom, according to the Late Ordinances. The King took small Notice of their Supplications, left</HI> York, <HI>and repaired to</HI> Newcastle, <HI>where he continued for a considerable Space. Upon which the Lords, with what Forces they could raise, march'd with all Speed towards</HI> Newcastle, <HI>not that they would offer Injury, or create Trouble to their Sovereign, but only Earl</HI> Gaveston, <HI>and judge him according to the Laws they made by common Agreement. Upon their Approach, the King and</HI> Gaveston <HI>immediately fled to</HI> Tinmouth; <HI>and tho' tne Queen, then great with Child, with Flood of Tears, begg'd of him not to leave her in that Place, he without any Pity took Shipping, and salt'd with his Favourite to</HI>Scarborough, <HI>commanding the Garrison of the Castle to protect him, while he repair'd into</HI> War∣wickshire. <HI>The Earl of</HI> Lancaster <HI>having possessed himself of</HI> Newcastle, <HI>sent Messengers to the Queen at</HI>Tin∣mouth <HI>to comfort her, faithfully promising</HI> That he would not give over his Pursuit, 'till he had remov'd <HI>Gaveston</HI> from the King; <HI>excusing himself from not coming to her in Person,</HI> left for her Sake he should incut the King's Indignation. <HI>The Barons who had enter'd</HI> Newcastle <HI>the same Day the King went from thence, had seized all that he and his Favourite had left there, the Hurry wherein they went off not having given them leave to take any Thing with them. In</HI> Gaveston's <HI>Baggage were sound a great many Jewels, which for the most part belonged to the Crown, and of which an exact Inventory was taken, that an Account might be given of them hereafter: They were accordingly restored to the King after</HI>Gaveston <HI>was beheaded.</HI> Rapin.</P>
<P><HI>It appears by several Records, that there has been an ancient Custom within the said Town of</HI> Newcastle <HI>upon</HI> Tyne, <HI>of acknowledging Fines in the</HI> Guildhall <HI>of the said Town, between the four Benches therein; and that the same has been continued and usually practised, and is now frequently done.</HI></P>
<P><HI>A Fine so acknowledged for Lands or Tenements within the said Town, being by that Custom of the same Force and Validity as a Fine acknowledge in any other Manner; and it is done so publickly, and before so many Per∣sons, that the Cognizors must be known to some of them, which allows no Opportunity for a Fraud.</HI></P>
<P><HI>And when a Fine is to be acknowledged by a Wife, she is not only particularly examin'd in open Court, but also make's Oath, that what she does is freely and voluntarily, without any Force or Compulsion of her Husband.</HI></P></NOTE>1312</CELL>

<HEAD>A Patronage of the Chantry of St. <HI>Mary's</HI> in the Church of <HI>All Saints</HI> in the Town of <HI>Newcastle</HI> upon <HI>Tyne.</HI></HEAD>
<P>TO all who shall see or hear of this Writing <HI>Thomas</HI> de <HI>Karliol</HI> of <HI>Newcastle</HI> upon <HI>Tyne,</HI> Greeting in the Lord. Know ye, that I have granted, and by the present Writing have confirmed to <HI>Peter</HI> Son of <HI>Peter Draper,</HI> of the aforesaid Town of <HI>Newcastle,</HI> and <HI>Cecily</HI> his Wife, and to the Heirs from their Bodies lawfully begotten, all my Right of the Patronage of the Chantry belonging to the Altar of the blessed Virgin <HI>Mary</HI> in the Church of <HI>All Saints</HI> in the foresaid Town of <HI>Newcastle,</HI> for me and my Heirs: Granting that whenever it shall be vacant, then the foresaid <HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>Cecily,</HI> and the Heir's from their Bodies lawfully begotten, may give, conser and as∣sign the foresaid Chantry to some fit Chaplain, to celebrate for ever the divine Offices at the foresaid Altar, by doing and finding at the aforesaid Altar all Burthens belonging to the said Altar, as the other Predecessors have used to do. Saving nevertheless to me for my whole Life, the Right of presenting to the foresaid Chantry, if it shall happen to be vacant any Time of my Life. And be it known, that if the aforesaid <HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>Cecily</HI> shall die without Heirs from their Bodies lawfully begotten, I Will that the Right of Patronage of the Chantry aforesaid shall after their Decease, their Issue failing, as is aforesaid, for ever return to my right Heirs.

<ITEM><HI>Tho. Fleaminge</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><P><HI>David</HI> King of <HI>Scots</HI> en∣ter'd <HI>North∣umberland,</HI> exercising all Manner of Hostility, and wasting and Ravaging all before him, for about <HI>40</HI> Miles in length, 'till he came to <HI>Newcastle</HI> upon <HI>Tyne,</HI> which he resolved to Besiege, and so sat down with all his Forces before it: The Captain of the Castle was the Lord <HI>John Nevil</HI> of <HI>Hornby,</HI> a Person of great Conduct and Bra∣very who resolving to give the young King of <HI>Scotland</HI> a Taste of the <HI>English</HI> Valour, as soon as might be, com∣manded <HI>200</HI> Lances to make a Sally very early next Morning. These dashing suddenly with great Fury into the <HI>Scottish</HI> Hoast, on that Part where the Earl of <HI>Murray</HI> was (who, as they say, was chief General for the Time, the King himself keeping private) took the Earl himself naked in Bed, dragg'd him away naked out of his Tent;
<PB N="197" REF="208"/>
and so having slain several of his Men, and won much Booty, they return'd all safe into the Town with great Joy, and delivered the Earl of <HI>Murray</HI> Prisoner to their Captain. The Earl was a chief Prince of the Blood in <HI>Scotland,</HI> next of Quality to Prince <HI>Robert Stuart</HI> and the Earl of <HI>Southerland;</HI> but for Valour and Conduct he yielded to None. This daring Enterprize having alarmed the whole Camp, the <HI>Scots</HI> ran like Madmen to the Barriers of the Town, and began a fierce Assault, which they continued a great while with much Pertinency. But they gain'd little and lost much. For there were many good Men of War within, who defended themselves with much Resolution and Discretion, so that the <HI>Scots</HI> were at last fain to leave off their attac, and the Hopes of suddenly revenging their Dishonour in that Place. Wherefore that bold and lucky Attempt of the Besieged being thus well back'd by a vigorous Defence, was sufficient to persuade King <HI>David</HI> and his Council, that to dally about <HI>Newcastle</HI> was dangerous, whereupon about Noon they decamp'd and went for <HI>Durham.</HI></P>
<P>Assoon as the Lord <HI>Nevil</HI> had seen for certain the Departure of the <HI>Scots,</HI> he guess'd their Design. Upon which he mounted a very swift Gelding, and coasting wide of the <HI>Scots,</HI> rode Post Day and Night; 'till on the 5th Night he rode more than <HI>200</HI> Miles to <HI>Chertsey</HI> in <HI>Surry,</HI> where at that Time King <HI>Edward</HI> lay, to whom he exactly related all he knew of the <HI>Scots,</HI> whereupon the <HI>King</HI> made all the Haste he could Northward.</P>
<P>In the mean Time the <HI>Scots</HI> assaulted <HI>Durham</HI> with all the Fury imaginable; for they were even stark mad for the former Affront they had received at <HI>Newcastle,</HI> when they lost the Earl of <HI>Murray</HI> so dishonourably. They rear'd their Engines to cast Stones, and other Devices they had, whereby to approach the Walls under the Shelter of certain Machines, resembling the ancient <HI>Testudo</HI> of the <HI>Romans,</HI> or the <HI>Synospismus</HI> of the <HI>Greeks;</HI> and withall they had other Engines running upon Wheels, wherein on Lofts as high as the <HI>Walls</HI> at least, there were <HI>Cross-Bows</HI> and others, who kept the Besieged from the Defences. So that after the Assault had been continual∣ly renewed with all the Vigour imaginable, and on the other Hand maintained with incredible Obstinacy for <HI>6</HI> or <HI>7</HI> Days, the <HI>Scots</HI> entred the City by Force; at which Time King <HI>David</HI> in revenge of all his Losses for so many years preceding, especially being urged beyond his Nature by the importunate Instigations of his <HI>French</HI> Auxiliaries then with him, commanded his Captains to put all to Fire and Sword. There were Men, Women, and Children, old and young, Men of the Church, as <HI>Monks, Priests, Canons,</HI> and others, holy and prophane, all without Pity or Distinction put to Death, neither <HI>Churches, Monasteries,</HI> nor <HI>Shrines,</HI> no not that of St. <HI>Cuthbert</HI> him∣self (after it had reposed there for more than <HI>300</HI> years) could reconcile the incens'd Mind of the Soldiers to Pi∣ty; not so much as one Soul was left alive within the Place. So implacable and unmerciful is the Sword of War when sharpen'd with unchristian Cruelty.</P>
<P>Before the <HI>Scottish</HI> Army got back to its own Country, the King of <HI>England</HI> was upon their Heels; but there were certain <HI>Noblemen</HI> on both Parts, who earnestly labour'd to compose the Matters between the two <HI>Kings,</HI> which at last took such Effect, that a Truce was concluded for two years. <HI>Barns.

<HEAD>The following Letter I am obliged to Mr. Alderman <HI>REAY</HI> of this Town for.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>PUrsuant to your Request and my Promise I've been with Mr. <HI>Harle,</HI> and have met with the Passage you mentioned relating to <HI>Newcastle,</HI> in the 119th Page of the first Vol. of <HI>Ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>luyt's English Voya∣ges,</HI> &amp;c. printed at <HI>London,</HI> 1599, Fol. by which it appears that the Town of <HI>Newcastle</HI> assisted K. <HI>Edw.</HI> III. with 17 Ships and 314 Men against the <HI>French;</HI> a most authentic and convincing Proof of the great Naval Strength of that Town in those Days.</P>
<P>Another earlier Instance of its being a Town famous for Trade in <HI>Edward</HI> II<HI>'s</HI> Time, is to be found in p. 142. and 143 of the said Vol. where we meet with an Order of the King and Council for the Sta∣ple to be holden at a certain Place. This Order (relating to the Exportation of Wool) is directed to the Collectors of Custom for Wool and Woolen Fells in the Port of <HI>London.</HI> The Title of it runs thus, <HI>De Stapula tenenda in certo loco ordinatio, Anno</HI> 13, Edwardi <HI>secundi;</HI> and the Order itself thus, <HI>Rex col∣lectoribus custumae canarum &amp; pellium canutarum in portu</HI> London <HI>salutem,</HI> ending with these Words; <HI>Teste Rege apud</HI> Doveram <HI>decimo octavo die</HI> Junii <HI>per ipsum Regem &amp; consilium;</HI> and immediately after is subjoin'd as follows; <HI>Et postmodum per breve de privato sigillo eodem modo mandatum est collectoribus Custu∣mae praedictae in Portubus subscriptis, videlicet.</HI>

<P>It would be as fatiguing as 'tis unnecessary to transcribe at length the said Order, which must there∣fore be omitted as well as the long Roll of the English Fleet contain'd in the 118, 119 and 120 Pages of the said Book; I shall only tell you that the Account of the Fleet is thus inscrib'd.</P>

<P>I cannot leave this List, without observing to the great Honour of that loyal and brave Town, that <HI>Newcastle</HI> is not exceeded in its Number of Ships by any one of all the 33 Ports nam'd in the said En∣rolment of the North Fleet. <HI>Yarmouth</HI> alone excepted. And how can it possibly detract from the Glory of <HI>Newcastle,</HI> to be then out-done by <HI>Yarmouth,</HI> when (which is very surprizing) that same great <HI>Yar∣mouth,</HI> in <HI>Norfolk,</HI> fitted out a vastly greater Number both of Men and Ships, than <HI>London</HI> itself, the great Metropolis of the Kingdom, furnish'd his Grace with for the memorable Siege of <HI>Calais,</HI> where he (I mean King <HI>Edward</HI> III.) and his Son the Black Prince acquir'd such Renown to the English, as will render themselves and the English Nation famous to succeeding Ages.</P>
<P>There is one Thing more I must take Notice of before I conclude, which is, that the aforemention∣ed Fleet Roll has no Date. I think it was about the Year 1347, when the English laid Siege to Calais, tho' I can't certainly tell, not having an English History by me at present.

<HEAD>An Assise by the Prior of <HI>Durham</HI> against the Mayor and Bailiffs of <HI>Newcastle,</HI> for the yearly Rent of the House of <HI>Farneland.</HI></HEAD>
<P>AN Assise taken at <HI>Newcastle</HI> upon <HI>Tyne</HI> before <HI>Thomas</HI> de <HI>Fencotes, Thomas</HI> de <HI>Seton,</HI> and <HI>Roger</HI> de <HI>Blaykeston,</HI> Justices of our Lord the King, at the Assises to be held in the County of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> as∣signed on Wednesday in the third Week of <HI>Lent,</HI> in the twenty fifth year of the Reign of King <HI>Edward</HI> in <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> the Third from the Conquest, and the twelfth of his Reign in <HI>France,</HI> by virtue of a certain Commission di∣rected to them and <HI>William Bassep;</HI> the Presence of the said <HI>William</HI> not being expected, by virtue of a certain Brief of our Lord the King, But of not all, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>The Assises came to consider and know, if <HI>Peter Graper,</HI> Mayor, of the Town of <HI>Newcastle</HI> upon <HI>Tyne, John</HI> de <HI>Emeldon, Hugh</HI> de <HI>Angerton, Hugh</HI> de <HI>Carlel,</HI> and <HI>William</HI> de <HI>Acton</HI> Bailiffs of the said Town of <HI>New∣castle</HI> had unjustly disseised <HI>John</HI> Prior of <HI>Durham</HI> from his free Tenement in the said Town of <HI>Newcastle</HI> upon <HI>Tyne</HI> after Possession, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And it is enquired why they disseised him from thirteen Marks and ten Shillings, the Rent with the Appurtenances, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>And <HI>Peter</HI> and the others did not come; And the Sheriff declared, that the foresaid <HI>Hugh</HI> de <HI>Angerton,</HI> and <HI>Hugh</HI> de <HI>Carlel</HI> are dead: And the foresaid <HI>Peter</HI> is attached by <HI>Henry Glassen Wright,</HI> and <HI>Thomas</HI> de <HI>Newbigging;</HI> and the foresaid <HI>John</HI> de <HI>Emeldon</HI> by <HI>Thomas</HI> de <HI>Newbigging</HI> and <HI>Thomas Stele;</HI> and the foresaid <HI>Wiliam</HI> by <HI>Thomas</HI> de <HI>Newbigging</HI> and <HI>Henry Glassen Wright:</HI> Therefore they are in Mercy, and let the aforesaid Assise be taken against them by Default, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>And upon this the aforesaid Prior by his Attorney says, That our Lord the King now reigning, by his Charter, because he heard from the Testimony of those whom he credits; That our Lord <HI>Edward,</HI> lately King of <HI>England,</HI> his Father, had in his Life, by Word of Mouth, granted to the Monks dwelling in the Island of <HI>Farneland</HI> near <HI>Bamburgh,</HI> which Island is a Cell of the Priory of <HI>Durham,</HI> ten Quarters of Corn and two Tuns of Wine, to be received every Year by the Hands of the Mayor and Bailiffs of <HI>Newcastle</HI> upon <HI>Tyne,</HI> as an Alms of his said Fa∣ther for ever. And that this Grant was not duly put in Execution in the Life-time of his said Father, nor con∣firmed by any of his Letters. Our present Lord the King for the Health of the Soul of his Father, being willing to fulfil and continue his Will in this Part, hath granted to the aforesaid Monks as a Compensation of the afore∣said Corn and Wine, thirteen Marks and ten Shillings, to be received every year at the Feast of St. <HI>Michael</HI> by the Hands of the Mayor and Bailiffs of the said Town of <HI>Newcastle</HI> upon <HI>Tyne</HI> then being, from the Fee of the said Town, namely, Five Marks for every Tun of Wine, and five Shillings for every Quarter of Corn, to be paid to the said Monks and their Successors dwelling in the foresaid Island as his Alms for ever; and he produces in Court the foresaid Charter of our present Lord the King, which testifies this, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And he prays Assise: Let an Assise therefore be taken, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>By a Recognition of the aforesaid Assise, they say upon their Oath, that the aforesaid Prior was seised of the foresaid Rent with the Appurtenances, 'till the foresaid <HI>Peter</HI> and others disseised him, to the Loss of the said Prior forty one Pounds, thirteen Shillings and four Pence. It follows therefore that the aforesaid Prior may thence re∣cover his Seisine against those by a Sight of the Recognition of the Assise aforesaid; and his Losses aforesaid; and the said <HI>Peter</HI> and others are in the Injury. And let not the Sheriff be omitted because of the Liberty of the afore∣said Town because that otherwise, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>

<HEAD>Original of Extempore Prayer, never to be forgotten, which the <HI>Covenant</HI> and <HI>Directory</HI> may boast of.</HEAD>
<P>WHILE Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> and her excellent Ministry endeavoured to establish the Church of <HI>England</HI> upon the best Foundations, and sensible of the Attempts against her Liturgy, first at <HI>Geneva,</HI> and afterwards at <HI>Franc∣fort,</HI> and all reasonable Propositions to convince the <HI>Puritans, Rome</HI> offers openly to abet that Separation, in a Way so plausible, that had not Heaven detected the first Agent, the <HI>Anabaptism</HI> of <HI>Germany</HI> must have rooted in <HI>Eng∣land</HI> under so gifted a Teacher as <HI>Faithful Cummin,</HI> a noted <HI>Dominican,</HI> whose History I transcribe from <HI>Scrype</HI>'s Life of Archbishop <HI>Parker,</HI> pag. <HI>230</HI> and <HI>244.</HI></P>
<P><Q>In this Year came one of these Dissenting Preachers, in Appearance (but in Truth a <HI>Dominican</HI> Friar) to <HI>Maidstone,</HI> to the <HI>Maidenhead</HI> Inn there, with divers others his Followers; where, as Guests, they bespa e a Dinner: Divers others resorted hither, enquiring for this Man, whose Name was <HI>Faithful Cummin.</HI> These were his Congregation. Being thus met in the Room they had taken up, <HI>Cummin</HI> exercised extemporary Prayer for about two Hours, groaning and weeping much. The Exercise being over, most of the Company departed; some few carried and partook with the Exerciser of the Dinner provided.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Of this Meeting <HI>John Clarkson,</HI> the Archbishop's Chaplain, being informed, acquainted his Grace, and be the Queen and Council. Before whom at length this Man was convened the next Year, as a Sower of Sedition among the Queen's Subjects: Here the Archbishop examined him; he acknowledged he was ordained by Cardi∣nal <HI>Pole,</HI> but said that he was fallen off from <HI>Rome,</HI> and that he was a Preacher of the Gospel; but that he had no Licence to preach from any of the Bishops, since the Reformation. And when the Archbishop asked him, if he had no such Licence, how any could be assured that he was not of the <HI>Romish</HI> Church? He would prove that by his Prayers and Sermons, wherein he had spoken against <HI>Rome</HI> and the <HI>Pope,</HI> as much as any of the Clergy. And he pretented, that it was Licence enough to preach, to have the Spirit which he said he had. When the Archbishop again demanded, whether that could be the Spirit, that complied not with the Or∣ders
<PB N="226" REF="237"/>
of the Church, lately purged and cleansed from Idolatry? He replied, he endeavoured to make the Church purer than it was. This Man had a Congregation, that followed him; which he termed Men of tender Con∣sciences: And with them he prayed and preached, and administred the Sacrament. When he preached in pub∣lick, he would be absent till the Divine Service were over (for the <HI>English</HI> Liturgy he could not away with) and then he could come into the Church and preach.</Q></P>
<P><Q>After his former Examination, and giving Bail for his farther Appearance, he found Opportunity to escape beyond Sea; telling his Congregation, that he was warned of God to travel abroad, to instruct Protestants in the other Parts of the World, and would come again to them: Leaving these as his last Words to them, That spiritual Prayer was the chief Testimony of a true Protestant; and that the Set Form of Prayer was but the Mass translated; and so praying with them, and getting Money from them to bear his Expences, in many Tears he parted from them; and was afterwards seen in the <HI>Low Countries,</HI> went to <HI>Rome,</HI> and upon de∣claring his Services to the Pope, who, after commending him, gave him a Reward of Two Thousand Ducati.</Q> This is more amply related in the First Part of <HI>Foxes and Firebrands,</HI> pag. <HI>13.</HI></P>

To this he answer'd, He will not declare but to a lawful Judge of Religion. <HI>3.</HI> Whether the Pope hath Power to excommunicate Kings, such as are not of his Church, as his Majesty? To this he answer'd affirmatively; and that all People baptiz'd are under the Pope's Power. <HI>4.</HI> Whether it be no Murder to kill the King so deposed? <HI>5.</HI> Whether he hath Power to assoil Subjects from the Oath of their Allegiance to his Majesty? To these he answers <HI>ut supra.</HI></P>
<P>He railed at the Oath of Allegiance as damnable and treasonable against God; so became unworthy of Mercy, and order'd to prepare for his Trial; and the Evening before it began, was told, that he was not to be tried for any thing relating to his Religion, but for his former Answers to the Questions, which he may recal, and crave Mercy: This he utterly refused. Upon his Trial, he protests not to acknowledge the Judges nor Judgment lawful: The King to have no Authority but derivative from his Predecessors, who acknowledged the Pope's Jurisdiction: If the King will be to me, as they were to mine, he shall be my King; if otherwise, I value him not: And that I repent only for not having been so busy as I should in that which you call perverting of Subjects, and I call saving of Souls: I do decline the King's Authority, and will do it still in Matters of Religion; most of your Ministers maintain it, and if they be wise, will continue in that Mind. His insolent Speech was shortned by the Jurors quick Return, who found him guilty, and he had Sentence of Treason; and to stop his Raillery, he was after Noon the same Day hanged at <HI>Glasgow.</HI></P>
<P>He was a desperate second <HI>Ravillae,</HI> and ready in that Devilish Doctrine of Deposing and Dethroning Kings; which he urged the more (he said) as consonant to the Kir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Ministers Tenets; and that nothing troubled him, but to be taken away 'ere he had done That which all <HI>Scotland</HI> and <HI>England</HI> should not have prevented; and had it been performed, no Torments would have been by him refused.</P></NOTE><HI>1614.</HI></CELL>

The Earl of <HI>Lothian</HI> was made Governor of the Place, with a Garrison of <HI>2000</HI> Men. Which Trust they thought he well deserved, such was his Zeal to the Cause, that tho' both his Father and himself owed all their Wealth and Greatness to the King's Bounty, yet he was one of the first that engaged against him. At the same Time a more dismal Fate attended the Lord <HI>Haddington,</HI> who, having a vowedly fallen from the King's Side, and listed under <HI>Lesley,</HI> was left at home with his Regiment to attend the Motions of the Garrison of <HI>Berwick.</HI> For that purpose, he kept his Quarters at <HI>Dunglass,</HI> where standing at Noon-day in the Court-yard with about sixty Gentlemen, the Castle having a Magazine of Powder, which sud∣denly taking Fire, was blown up, and in a Moment buried him and all his Company, so that they were never more seen. This Tragical Event being reported at Court, the Royalists were not so moderate in their Consures as the King himself, who only said, that he had been very ungrateful to him, yet he was sorry he had not Time to repent.</P>

<P>It was voted, that eight of the Lords, and six of the Commons, should be appointed as Commissioners to pay the <HI>Scots</HI> the Money of Assistance allowed them.</P>
<P><HI>July 7.</HI></P>
<P>At a Conference betwixt both Houses, there was a Debate about disbanding the Armies; and it was concluded on, that there should be <HI>50000 l.</HI> presently sent down for the disbanding the <HI>English</HI> Army, and the <HI>Scots</HI> to have <HI>60000 l.</HI> to disband theirs, to be paid by the Earl of <HI>Warwick.</HI></P>
<P><HI>August 6-</HI></P>
<P>At a Conference, the Lord <HI>Lowdon</HI> made a Report from the rest of the Lords in <HI>Scotland,</HI> that they had ac∣cepted the Articles of Pacification with much Thankfulness, and had agreed for the speedy disbanding of their Army, and given Publick Faith upon it.</P>
<P><HI>August 24.</HI></P>
<P>There came Letters this Day of the <HI>Scots</HI> marching away, and that his Majesty had prevailed with the Par∣liament of <HI>Scotland,</HI> that their Ordnance and Ammunition should be left at <HI>Newcastle</HI> to be conveyed to <HI>London.</HI></P></NOTE></CELL>

<ITEM><HI>Robert Ellison</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><P>On the 15th of <HI>January,</HI> this year, in a dismal snowy Season, the <HI>Scots,</HI> contrary to all Faith and Loyalty, passed the River <HI>Tweed</HI> at <HI>Berwick,</HI> ac∣company'd by a select Committee of their own, and there met another from <HI>England,</HI> who were to conduct and supply them in the most loving Manner: Upon their Conjunction, was framed the General Committee of both Kingdoms, and in Effect became a united Camp-Parliament. Before the Advance of the Army by a Trumpeter, they sent a Letter to Sir <HI>Thomas Glenham,</HI> and the rest of the Commanders and Gentlemen of <HI>Northumber∣land,</HI> at <HI>Alnwick;</HI> in which they insisted upon the Solemn League and Covenant, and declared their well-weighed Resolutions, to prevent that imminent Danger, not only of Corruption, but of Ruin, which they saw evidently in∣tended to the true Protestant Religion, by the Popish and Prelatical Faction; and to rescue his Majesty's Person and Honour from the Counsels of those, whose Ends are little better than Popery and Tyranny. Therefore, they expected the Concurrence of them, and all others; and if they met with any Opposition, the Law of Nature, and their own Reason, would tell them what they are to expect. With this Letter they sent also a Copy of the <HI>Scotch</HI> Declaration, to give it the greater Force and Authority among the Vulgar.</P>
<P>The brave Sir <HI>Thomas Glenham,</HI> after a serious Consultation with the Officers and Gentry, how most to in∣commode the Enemy's March, returned a sharp Answer; in which he and the rest declare. That, without the Sight of that Letter, they could not have believed that the <HI>Scottish</HI> Nation, or the present prevailing Party in that Nation, would have attempted an Invasion of <HI>England,</HI> so contrary to the Laws of God, of Nations, and of both Kingdoms, but especially to the late Act of Pacification; so opposite to their Allegiance and Gratitude to his Ma∣jesty, to that neighbourly Love they pretend, to that discreet Care they should have of their own Safety. They declare, that no Order of Committees whatsoever, of Men, or Angels, could give Power to make War against their natural Sovereign, upon the empty Pretence of nameless evil Counsellors; and for the <HI>English</HI> Agents, they could not believe them any Commissioners lawfully authorized by the Two Houses of Parliament, or yet by the House of Commons, whence so many Members were expell'd by partial Voting, so many banished by seditious Tumults, so many voluntarily absent out of Conscience; where Desperation, Want of Opportunity to depart, or Fear of certain Plunder, were the chief Bonds which held the little Remnant together from Dissipation , where the venerable Name of <HI>Parliament</HI> was made a State to countenance the pernicious Counsels and Acts of a close Committee.</P>
<P>As to the <HI>Scots,</HI> they declare, that no Covenant whatsoever could justify such Proceedings, begun without any Necessity, or so much as Provocation. After answering their Pretensions, they desire them to consider, that there must be an Account given to God of all the Blood which should be shed in this Quarrel: And since their Insults
<PB N="233" REF="244"/>
were such, that a vanquished Nation could scarce endure, from their Conquerors, they could not think they were grown so same, as to desert ther Religion, Laws, Liberties, and Estates, upon Command of Foreigners; and to suffer themselves to be made Beggars, and Slaves, without Opposition.</P>
<P>These Paper-Skirmishes had no other Effect, than to gain some little Time for Sir <HI>Thomas Glenham</HI> to draw his Forces and Artillery to <HI>Newcastle,</HI> for <HI>Alnwick</HI> was not tenable; besides, he found several of the Gentlemen of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> especially such as were allied to the Lord <HI>Grey</HI> of <HI>Wark,</HI> either for fear of the <HI>Scotch,</HI> or Affection to their Cause, were very backward in opposing the Enemy. The <HI>Scotch</HI> marched after him by slow and difficult Marches, by Reason of the Snow and Floods, and on the 3d of <HI>February</HI> summoned the Town of <HI>Newcastle,</HI> but finding they were not able to take the Place, after three Weeks Stay, and some Skirmishes, they passed the River <HI>Tyne</HI> on the 28th of <HI>February,</HI> and on the 4th of <HI>March</HI> entred <HI>Sunderland.</HI> The Marquis of <HI>Newcastle,</HI> Ge∣neral for the King in these <HI>Northern</HI> Parts, having reinforced his Army to about <HI>14,000</HI> Horse and Foot, attended so near the <HI>Scotch</HI> Army, and so intercepted their Supplies, that sometimes they had neither Meat nor Drink, and were never possessed of above twenty-four Hours Provision; but they coloured over their necessity by keeping a so∣lemn Fast; and pressing on towards <HI>Durham</HI> for better Quarters, to stop their advancing, on the Twenty-third of <HI>March</HI> the Marquis drew up his Army at <HI>Hilton,</HI> on the <HI>North</HI> of the River <HI>Were;</HI> the <HI>Scots</HI> were drawn up on <HI>Whitburn Lizard,</HI> a Hill <HI>East</HI> from them, adjoining to the Sea: So the Armies faced each other, and skir∣mished in Parties; the Field-Word given by the Marquis being prophetically enough, <HI>Now or Never;</HI> and by the <HI>Scots,</HI> in their assuming Way, <HI>The Lord of Hosts is with us.</HI> The Marquis not being able to force the <HI>Scots</HI> to a Battle, retreated towards his Quarters at <HI>Durham,</HI> and the <HI>Scots</HI> followed slowly, but could make no conside∣rable Advance, till the Lord <HI>Fairfax,</HI> and the rest of the Parliament Forces, by a new Diversion, gave them Op∣portunity to descend into <HI>Yorkshire. Echard.</HI></P>
<P>In the same Year, after the City of <HI>York</HI> had surrender'd to the Parliament, the three Armies thought sit to separate; the <HI>Scottish</HI> Army was order'd to march <HI>Northwards,</HI> and joining with the Earl of <HI>Calander,</HI> who had enter'd <HI>England</HI> with <HI>10,000 Scots,</HI> laid Siege to <HI>Newcastle</HI> on the 13th of <HI>August;</HI> the Siege lasted above two Months, and proved one of the most resolute in the Kingdom; all Sorts of Policy of Peace and War; by Treaty, by Mines, by Assaults, having been used to little Effect, the Inhabitants resolving (if possible) never to fall into the Hands of the <HI>Scots.</HI> But on <HI>Saturday</HI> the 19th of <HI>October</HI> the whole <HI>Scotch</HI> Army furiously set upon the Town, and having made three Breaches, after a tedious and bloody Storm, they at last master'd it. Sir <HI>John Marley,</HI> Sir <HI>Nicholas Cole,</HI> and Sir <HI>George Barker,</HI> got into the Castle, where being forced by Necessity, they came to a Capitulation, and surrender'd on the 27th of the same Month. The Town being taken by Assault, was sufficiently plunder'd; but the Surrendry proved of great Importance to the City of <HI>London,</HI> where the poorer Sort of People, for the two last Years, were almost starved for want of Fewel, Coals having been risen to the Price of <HI>4 l.</HI> a Chaldron; a Price never known before that Time. <HI>Echard.</HI></P>
<P>In this Year the round Tower under the <HI>Moot-Hall,</HI> towards the <HI>Sand-Hill,</HI> called the <HI>Half-Moon,</HI> which was the old Castle of <HI>Monkchester,</HI> was by Sir <HI>John Marley</HI> made use of to secure the River and Key-side against the <HI>Scots,</HI> and the other Castle he put into good Repair, which was very ruinous: On the former he laid great Guns, for the Use above-mentioned; and on the latter he laid great Ordnance, to beat off those Guns which the <HI>Scots</HI> had laid upon the Banks of <HI>Gateshead</HI> against the Town. And this he managed bravely for a long time; for the <HI>Scots</HI> began the siege about <HI>July,</HI> and it was the 19th of <HI>October</HI> before they could take it; which they did by Storm, upon the Day after St. <HI>Luke</HI>'s Day; and it was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> by the <HI>White Fryer Tower</HI> and <HI>Sand∣gate,</HI> where the Colliers of <HI>Elswick</HI> and <HI>Benwell</HI> were employed under one <HI>John Osbourn</HI> (a false rebellious <HI>Scot</HI>) to undermine the Walls; which they did, and blew them up, and so got and plunder'd the Town. And no marvel, for they were accounted <HI>30,000</HI> Men, and the Townsmen were but, in all, <HI>1500</HI> Men, wearied with continual Watch and Duty, tho' Men of great Courage, and sought it gallantly to the last; for the <HI>Newgate</HI> Ward, which was under Capt. <HI>Cuthbert Carr,</HI> was taken by the Enemy, who entered at the asoresaid Places, and en∣compassed them before and behind; and <HI>Pilgrim-street</HI> Gate was maintained by Capt. <HI>George Errington,</HI> Lieu∣tenant <HI>William Robson,</HI> and Ensign <HI>Thomas Swan,</HI> who sought and killed very many, they themselves not having one hurt, until they were encompassed by the Enemy before and behind: And even then they would not parley with the <HI>Scots</HI> who fought against them without, but did capitulate with Lieutenant-Colonel <HI>Sinclair,</HI> who loved and honoured them, and kept his Agreement so well with them, that not one of them was robbed of his Cloaths or Money, nor were any of his Men suffered to give any evil Word; and it was the great Blessing of God, that, in all that Time, there was not one Man slain, nor hurt, altho' that Company consisted of Ninescore Men, all TradesMen, and there were divers Sallies made out at that Gate; for it was the longest of all the Gates of the Town, it being barrocaded and shut up. And after they had surrender'd, and the Enemy was called over at that Breach, they durst not approach, but shot at their Friends that called them, and would not believe that the Town was taken.

<HEAD>The <HI>COMMITTEE</HI>'S <HI>DECLARATION.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>THE Committees of both Kingdoms, after many Meetings and serious Debates amongst themselves, and the hearing of sundry Persons well experienced in the Collieries and Coal-Works about the Town of</HI> Newcastle, <HI>and having taken into their serious Consideration sundry Propositions for the Good of those Works, and the driving on of that Trade for the Benefit of the Parliament, and the Pay of the Army, have at length concluded and agreed amongst themselves, that some of the most notorious Delinquents and Ma∣lignants, late Coal-Owners in the Town of</HI> Newcastle, <HI>should be wholly excluded from intermeddling with any Shares or Parts of Collieries, or Interest in any Coals whatsomever, that formerly they have laid Claim unto, and that the rest of the said Delinquents deserve not to have any Benefit of the said Coals or Col∣lieries: But in regard the Delinquents and Malignants belonging to those Collieries were very many in Number, they did not conceive it for the Service of the Parliament, or the Army, to put them all out at once, and so to hazard the retarding of the present setting on of the Works, and ruining of the same, in regard they were furnished with Materials and Utensils, and had Things ready at hand, and did best know where to find Workmen, which Strangers would have had Difficulty to find, and could not possibly on the sudden sufficiently provide themselves to set on the Works; and having made Trial to lett some Delin∣quents Collieries, and, for this Purpose, having treated with some well-affected Persons what Profit might be raised, and how they might be lett for the most Benefit to the Parliament, were constrain'd for the present rather to make Use of those Delinquents in working their own Collieries as Tenants and Servants to the Parliament, than to engage our Friends upon Incertainties, and hazard their Loss, as our own Hindrance in setting forward the Works, for the Use and Benefit of the Parliament. Wherefore the Com∣mittees of both Kingdoms, seeing the Necessity of dispatching away the Ships that every Day call upon us for their Lading, and lie at Charges in Expectation of getting Coals for their Money, have thought fit to make the following Declaration to all, but such as are expected as before-mentioned, and whose Names are hereafter written.</HI></P>
<P N="1"><HI>1st.</HI> That for the present Time there be allowed, on the behalf of the rest of the late Coal-Owners, <HI>10 s.</HI> Sterling upon every Chaldron of Ship-Coals, for desraying the Charges in the Works under-ground, Carri∣age thereof to the Staiths, and from thence in Keels to the Ships, paying the Town-Dues, as was formerly paid <HI>(viz.) 3 d.</HI> for the Town, and <HI>3 d.</HI> for the Garrison <HI>per</HI> Chalder, and the usual and accustomed Rents for the Pits; and as a competent Consideration for the Support of the said late Owners themselves, and this Allowance is made, as well for the Coals at the Staiths and Pits ready wrought, as those to be wrought, the said Owners, Collieries and Workmen, being always obliged to set on Foot with all Dili∣gence, and maintain their Coal-Works, make ready their Keels, and all other Necessaries sit for the same; and the Coal-Workers who are to receive the Benefit of Payment, as abovesaid, for their Work out of the Coals already above ground, are obliged to continue in working the said Coals at the ordinary Rate and Conditions, as was formerly accustomed, And whatsoover more Price the said Chalders of Coals (being sold to Merchants or Masters of ships) shall yield above the said <HI>10 s. per</HI> Chalder, together with what Custom and impost is or shall be put upon the same; and the old Custom of <HI>1 s.</HI> upon the Chalder for∣merly paid by the Owners to his Majesty, to be employed for the Pay and Maintenance of the Army, upon Account, to the Parliament of <HI>England,</HI> or their Committes.</P>
<P N="2"><HI>2dly.</HI> That the Coals already wrought above-ground, either at Pits or Staiths, Belonging to Friends, have like Allowance of <HI>10 s.</HI> upon the Chalder, they paying the said Town's Duties <HI>(viz.) 3 d.</HI> to the Town,
<PB N="235" REF="246"/>
and <HI>3 d.</HI> to the Garrison <HI>per</HI> Chalder. And the Surplus of the Price which they shall yield (<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eing sold to Merchants or Ship Masters) to be employed for the said public: Use by Way of Loan; and that they have the publick Faith for the same. The Owners, Taxmen and Workers, being always tied, to put on Foot and maintain the said Works, remitting to the Determination of the Parliament what other Con∣ditions they will be pleased to grant them for the Coals henceforth to be wrought.</P>
<P N="3"><HI>3dly.</HI> It is thought fit that the Price of Coals be <HI>15 s. per</HI> Chalder, with the Assess of <HI>4 s.</HI> upon the Chal∣der, and the ancient <HI>12 d,</HI> to the King, is <HI>20 s.</HI> for every Chalder to Merchant or Skipper, for all Coals vended in this Port of <HI>Newcastle;</HI> and for those exported, to pay the same Rate, and such further Cus∣tom as is ordained by the Book of Custom-Rates.</P>
<P N="4"><HI>4thly.</HI> That Certification be made to the several Owners, of which we doubt not our Friends will take spe∣cial Notice, and instantly apply themselves to set on their Works, that if presently they use not all possible Diligence in getting on Foot their several Coal-Works, and in maintaining thereof, in that Case to be de∣clared uncapable of any future Benefit, which they might expect out of their said Collieries, and that other Persons shall be employed forworking the same, for the publick Use and Benefit of the Parliament and Army.</P>

<CELL><HI>Henry Rawling.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><P>In this year, when King <HI>Charles I.</HI> by his ill Success, was reduced to the lowest Ebb, he, upon some Assurances of Protection from the <HI>Scots,</HI> then besieging <HI>Newark,</HI> repaired to their Army, and immediately gave Orders to the Lord <HI>Bellasis</HI> to sur∣render <HI>Newark,</HI> which might have held out several Months longer; which done, the <HI>Scots</HI> Army, before they could have received any Orders from the Parliament, with uncommon Expedition, marched with him to <HI>New∣castle,</HI> where they arrived May the <HI>13th.</HI> About the Middle of <HI>July</HI> the Parliament sent their Commissioners, the Earls of <HI>Pembroke</HI> and <HI>Suffolk,</HI> of the Peers, and Sir <HI>Walter Earl,</HI> Sir <HI>John Hippisley, Robert Goodwin,</HI> and <HI>Luke Robinson,</HI> Esqrs. for the Commons, with <HI>10</HI> Propositions for his Majesty to assent to, [<HI>See</HI> Rushworth.] Demands of such a horrid and destructive Nature, as would, if granted, have render'd the King and his Me∣mory inglorious and despicable both at home and abroad. The King perceiving all Things tending to his Ruin, he seemed to hearken most to his old false Friend <HI>William Murray</HI> of the Bed-Chamber, who privately proposed an Escape, and offered to make his Way, and to have a ship in Readiness to transport his Majesty beyond Sea. The Project appeared plausible, and the King had disguised himself for it, but was discovered in the Attempt. Whether he was faithful to his Majesty in this Point, is uncertain, since Sir <HI>Robert Murray</HI> was concerned in it; but Bishop <HI>Guthry</HI> says it was divulged before the set Time, so that there was no Discourse throughout the Army but of <HI>Murray</HI>'s Plot to carry away the King. Thereupon a Guard of Soldiers was immediately planted at his Cham∣ber, Door, both within and without; by which his Majesty was not only deprived of Liberty, but also of Quiet and Retirement; and having an Antipathy against Tobacco, was much disturbed by their bold and continual smoaking in his Presence: A military Presage of the same heathenish Barbarity at going to the Block before <HI>Whitehall.</HI></P>
<P>Upon his Majesty's Entry into <HI>Newcastle,</HI> he was caressed with Bonfires and Ringing of Bells, Drums and Trumpets, and Peals of Ordnance; but guarded by <HI>300</HI> of the <HI>Scottish</HI> Horse, these near him bare-headed. He lodged at General <HI>Levin</HI>'s Quarters, who proclaims that Papists or Delinquents should not come near his Person.</P>
<P>And that altho' his Majesty was present, yet all Men whatsoever should yield Obedience to the Ordinance of Parliament.</P>
<P>The <HI>Scotch</HI> Army are now, they imagine, Masters of all, by their Power of the King's Person, and levy into∣lerable Taxes and Assessments upon all <HI>Northern</HI> Counties, which very coursely resent them, and complain to the Parliament at <HI>Westminsters,</HI> not without some Rising of the People standing upon their Guard: And all the <HI>Scotch</HI> Hors formerly sent into <HI>Scotland</HI> are return'd into <HI>Yorkshire;</HI> which makes the House of Common debate and vote, That this Kingdom had no further Need of the Army of our Brethren the <HI>Scots</HI> in this Kingdom, and that the Sum of <HI>100,000 l.</HI> should be advanced and paid to that Army as followeth, <HI>viz, 50,000 l.</HI> thereof after their surrendring of <HI>Newcastle, Carlisle,</HI> and other <HI>English</HI> Garrisons possessed by them in <HI>England,</HI> and the other <HI>50,000 l.</HI> after they are advanced into <HI>Scotland,</HI> and Order shall be taken for Payment of their Arrears.</P>
<P>And forthwith Mr. <HI>Alexander Henderson,</HI> the <HI>Scots</HI> Apostolick: Minister, and one of their Commissioners, was sent from <HI>Westminster</HI> to <HI>Newcastle</HI> to dispute with the King, and to convince him to the Covenant; where, after several Discourse and Meetings, the King is pleased to descend so low as to argue Reasons by Wri∣tings, which continued several Encounters by Papers till the 16th of <HI>July,</HI> concerning Church-Matters, by Auth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rity of the Fathers, and Practice of the Church, which <HI>Henderson</HI> would avoid, by Texts of <HI>Scripture,</HI> and from thence, his own Opinion should guide him beyond all universal Consent or Practice of the Primitive Church which were erroneous, which was not contradicted by orthodox learned Men in the Times of the first Practice, as is easily percieved: That these Desections were, some of them justly called Rebellions, which <HI>Henderson</HI> mentions. And lastly, that alleit he never esteem'd any Authority equal to the Scripture, yet he thanks the numerous Con∣sent of the Fathers, and the universal Practice of the Primitive Church, to be the best and Authentical Inter∣preters of God's Word, and consequently the purest Judges between him and <HI>Henderson,</HI> until better may be sound;
<PB N="236" REF="247"/>
as for Example, he says, <HI>I think Mr.</HI> Henderson <HI>the best Preacher in</HI> Newcastle, <HI>yet I believe you may err, and possibly a better Preacher may come; but till then I must retain my Opinion.</HI> C.R.</P>
<P>These Disputes are in Print, which shews his Majesty's Temper and Knowledge, to treat so long with a peevish Presbyter.</P>
<P>Only the King was rid of one troublesome Guest Mr. <HI>Henderson;</HI> who had been disputed into so much Reason and Understanding, that being convinced by the King, he fell into some Distemper at <HI>Newcastle,</HI> and therefore was sent home to <HI>Scotland,</HI> where he died perfectly reconciled to the King's Affairs, and an Apostate from the <HI>Scots</HI> Army and their Proceedings. <HI>Sanderson's</HI> Hist. of K. <HI>Charles I. p. 904, 905, 921.</HI></P>

<P>The <HI>Scots</HI> now in some Jealousy how mightily the King complies with his Parliament, and that they should not be able, perhaps, to effect their Designs by Force, endeavour it by Fraud and Cunning, by insinuating to the Parliament, that their Conscience bears them Witness, of their constant Endeavours to preserve the Union of both Kingdoms; yet never more than since the King's coming to their Army, by effecting such Messages from his Ma∣jesty as might be a sure Ground of Peace to his People, and Happiness to himself. And although we have not as yet prevailed over his Principles, deeply rooted in him, as to obtain the utmost of our Desires, which we hope in a short Time to effect; and we hope that accordingly the Parliament will be pleased to send their Propositions of Peace to him, upon whose Answer we shall clearly know how to proceed in the intendedPacification, and to satisfy the Parliament in disbanding our Armies, delivering up the Garrisons Possessed by us, and retiring home for the Good of both Kingdoms.</P>
<P>This was dated at <HI>Newcastle</HI> the 10th of <HI>June 1646,</HI> and signed by General <HI>Levens</HI> and all the <HI>Scotch</HI> Com∣missioners, and directed to the Parliament.</P>
<P>After many Alterations and Disputes between the <HI>Scots</HI> and the Parliament relating to the King, it was at last agreed to deliver him up, upon their being paid <HI>400,000 l.</HI> for their Arrears.

<P>A little after the King's coming to <HI>Newcastle,</HI> a <HI>Scotch</HI> Minister preached boldly before him; and when his Sermon was done, called for the 52d Psalm, which begins,</P>
<Q><L>Why dost thou, Tyrant, boast thy self,</L>

<P>THE Mayor, Aldermen, and Commonalty of this Town, did most freely and unanimously joyne in a Petition to the House of Commons, for speedy and impartial Justice upon the great Incendiaries be∣twixt these two Kingdoms, and the chief Promoters of this Election, who have already confess'd them∣selves guilty of all the Blood which hath been shed by this unnatural Warr, who have been twice con∣quered by Us, and this we ground upon our <HI>Solemn League and Covenant,</HI> to which we have always ad∣hered, and by which all Delinquents ought to be brought to condign Punishment, without Exception; though our Treaties have, upon what Grounds wee know not, nor are not yet satisfyed, admitted of a Personal Treaty with the Cheife of Them, as if, after twice conquered, he or his Party was sensible there∣of, and of whom, as wee yet hear of, any Conviction of Conscience or Judgment, but only for an Op∣portunity to cut the Throats of Us and all others, that have ingaged against them in this Nation; and be∣ing so unhappy that wee could not by any Means obtain their Judgment thereof, or Intentions thereupon, it hath added many sad Fears and Thoughts to our former Perplexities, and even astonshed Us to consi∣der how our Bondage and Ruine is by this Treaty, since our Petition, so just, rational, and in Prosecution of our Covenant, and their own Proceedings, should appear unworthy of the least Respects or Conside∣ration; and therefore.

<P>AT my coming home, I received a Letter from my Lord of <HI>Durham,</HI> wherein he was pleased to give me the Honour as to intimate unto me the Concerns of his Majesty's Letter to our Magistrates, much concurrent with the Intelligence you received from Court, and desired me to press Mr. Mayor, Sir <HI>James Clavering,</HI> and Sir <HI>Fracis Anderson,</HI> with this necessary Duty of suppressing these illegal, riotous, schisma∣tical, and, as near as may be conjectured, seditious Assemblies: And this to be done with the Concurrence of the rest of the Ministers.

<P>This for the Account of our Zeal to suppress those Caterpillars, and our Obedience to my Lord's Com∣mands. Now for Matter of Fact, I know not of any thing as yet done; it is publickly known that a Let∣ter is come from the King about them: The Magistrates, I hear, have been consulting about it; what the Result is, I know not; their Actings will discover their Counsels, I hope well of them: But if I had been a Magistrate, and none had been wiser than I, they should have been secured before this Time. I shall from Time to Time give you an Account what I see or know to be done in this grand Affair; in the mean time, beg your Acceptance of these Lines, from him who is,</P>

<P>I Have received your Letter of the 15th Instant, together with the Inclosed, which I delivered to Mr. Se∣cretary. Sir <HI>John Trever,</HI> who read it to me, and hath acquainted his Majesty with it.</P>
<P>I am glad to find by both these your Letters, that you declare your Readiness to put the Laws in Ex∣ecution against Conventicles, and unlawful Assemblies, for pretended religious Worship in that Town, whereinto both you and my self are in this Case intrusted to have a particular and diligent Inspection. But on the other Side, I am sorry to hear from you, that you have had neither any Information, nor any Evi∣dence given you against such unlawful Assemblies in your Town, when the Notoriety of the Fact, by their numerous Meeting at your Barber-Chirurgeon<HI>'s</HI> Hall upon <HI>All-Saints</HI> Day last, being <HI>Sunday</HI> the 1st of <HI>No∣vember,</HI> was such, that it was voic'd and made known to all the Town and Country about; Notice being also taken what special <HI>Psalm,</HI> or <HI>New Rejoicing Song,</HI> they then chose and applied to themselves, as <HI>Holy Saints,</HI> of <HI>Bearing a double-edged Sword in their Hands to bind kings in Chains and Lords in Iron Bands:</HI> of which notorious and unlawful Meeting both my self and divers others here at this Distance were shortly

after informed; and I took the best Care I could thereupon to have an Address made unto you, Mr. Mayor, by a special Person under my Episcopal Jurisdiction, to desire you that you would not suffer any such scan∣dalous and offensive Meetings to be, held among you, contrary to the known Laws of this Church and Realm of <HI>England,</HI> and greatly endangering the Publick Peace thereof: And this I did before I acquainted his Majesty or his Principal Secretaries with it; neither was there any Letter sent to you and the Alder∣men from his Majesty concerning this Matter, before a second Information came both to my self, and Mr. <HI>Brabant,</HI> one of your own Society, of another numerous and unlawful Meeting at one of the Ringleader's Houses, upon the 25th of <HI>November,</HI> wherein they appointed and kept a Fast, with Preaching and Praying, which they held out from Eight a Clock in the Morning till Four in the Evening, the Work being held forth by their four chief Leaders and Abettors, Mr. <HI>Gilpine,</HI> Mr. <HI>Durant,</HI> Mr. <HI>Leaver,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Pringle.</HI> Of all which surely you had or might have had Knowledge; and if you had not, you will give me Leave to say, without Offence, that many of your Townsmen are very backward in discovering to you and arresting their Knowledge of such disorderly Assemblies, and that you are very great Strangers to the Affairs and Disturbances of your own Town, the Government whereof, under his Majesty, is committed to your Care.</P>
<P>It is well taken that, as you write, you have proceeded and convicted several of these disobedient Per∣sons already, and that you will take Care to prevent their Meetings against Law for Time to come; which good Resolution being observed by you, will highly please his Majesty, and express the Duty that we owe to his Laws, and the good Government of this Realm: Otherwise, if we any ways neglect to do herein what belongs to us, we shall deservedly suffer the Blame of it, and incur the King's Displeasure, which always most carefully to avoid, is the bounden Duty both of you and my self, who am,</P>

<P>PUblick Peace being the Life of the Kingdom, and Execution the Life of the Laws, it has been my En∣deavour to procure and preserve both, as in my Diocese in general, so in your Corporation in par∣ticular, being one of the most considerable Towns under my Episcopal Charge; witness my frequent Let∣ters to you in order to those good Ends. I should have been right glad to have seen, and would as gladly to your Advantage have reported the good Effects, as I am heartily sorry to hear still the contrary, which cannot be otherwise as long as the Ringleaders of the Factious are suffered to walk at Liberty, so expresly contrary to the Act 17 <HI>Carol.</HI> 11. which lies before you, to which the King's late Proclamation ought to have given fresh Vigour. I would fain vindicate the Town of <HI>Newcastle</HI> from the foul Imputation of be∣ing the Nursery of Faction in these Northern Parts; which as Things now stand I cannot do, but rather must, and according to my Duty will, report the contrary to the King, and his Council, and then any one may easily foresee the evil Consequences. Out of my special Respect to your Town and Corpora∣tion, I forbear still, in Expectation of a speedy Account that both the Act of Parliament, and the King's Proclamation in this behalf, are really obey'd, that is, duly executed. If, as I hear, any of the Seducers pretend they have subscribed and taken the Oath required by the Act 17 <HI>Car.</HI> II. I desire you would spee∣dily send me their Certificates; mean while, I hope that you will make good Use of this my last Warn∣ing, tendered unto you, out of my tender Care of the Welfare of your Town.

<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>Reverend and Honoured</HI> SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Did purposely delay my Answer to your last of the 22d past, till at my last Visitation I had enquired after, and examined the Reparation of the Chappel of <HI>Gosforth,</HI> within the Vicarage of <HI>Newcastle;</HI> the Result whereof is, 1. The said Chappel is not a Chappel of Ease, but a Parochial Chappel, which the Mo∣ther-Church is not bound to repair, but belongs to themselves: You know very well the Episcopal Sentence at the Dedication of such Chappels, the Body whereof lies upon the Parishioners of the Chappel, and the Chancel upon the Impropriators or Appropriators. 2. That by Order of Mr. <HI>George Willoughby,</HI> Tenant to the Lord Bishop of <HI>Carlisle,</HI> for his Part of the Tythes, Mr. <HI>Carr</HI> Alderman of <HI>Newcastle,</HI> his Sub-Tenant, hath configned 10. <HI>l.</HI> about the 8th Instant into the Hands of Capt. <HI>Fenwick</HI> and Mr. <HI>William Musgrave</HI> Cu∣rate of <HI>Gosforth,</HI> for the Repair of the same; and I am confident the Dean and Chapter will be as forward to follow that Example. 3. You were mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nformed concerning the Obligation of the poor Vicar of St. <HI>Nicholas</HI> to repair the Chappel, upon a Supposition that the Benefit of the Mortuaries, and of the Burials there, belongs to him, which you say are 13 <HI>s.</HI> 4 <HI>d.</HI> for each Burial, whereof the Vicar receives but 6 <HI>s.</HI> 8 <HI>d.</HI> but the Burthen of repairing the Chappels would, 'tis siad, surcharge the Vicarage in Value thrice over.</P>

<HEAD>A <HI>CASE</HI> touching the Chancel of the Church of <HI>South Gosforth,</HI> and some Proceedings concerning the same, truly Stated.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. IT is clear Law, that when no Person or Persons appear who are liable to the Repair of either Church or Chancol; that in such Case the Tythes or other Profits within that Parish are to be sequester'd for the said Repaire, after Notice given to the Parties concerned in such Profits. <HI>Constitut.

<P><HI>De Facto,</HI> Notice was frequently given to the Lord Bishop and Dean and Chapter of <HI>Carlisle,</HI> who are Impropriators of the Tythan within the Parish of <HI>Gosforth,</HI> and to their Farmers likewise, who should have appeared and showed something in Discharge of the <HI>Onus Reparandi;</HI> for <HI>Gosforth</HI> Church is neither Chap∣pel of Ease, non-Parochial Chappel within the Rectory of St. <HI>Nicholas,</HI> as the Case was mistated to Dr. <HI>Exton;</HI> 1. Because <HI>Gosforth</HI> is reputed and taken to be a Church and Parish distinct 2. The Parish of St. <HI>Nicholas</HI> is no Rectory, but a Vicarage; and in Cast two Churches Parochial be united, as probably these may be, the Reparation shall be severall as before, <HI>Hob.</HI> 67. 3. The Case was mistated to Dr. <HI>Exton</HI> in a ma∣terial and essential Part thereof, being put, of an Impropriator who repairs a Mother-Church; for, first, <HI>non Consent,</HI> in the Case of <HI>Gosforth</HI> Church that St. <HI>Nicholas</HI> is the Mother-Church, but rather the contrary, as above. Secondly; it is notorious that the Do<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> and Chapter of <HI>Carlisle</HI> have refused to repair the Chancel of St. <HI>Nicholas,</HI> and particularly to allow the late Dean's Accounts, who <HI>de facto</HI> once repaired it; so that the Case put to Dr. <HI>Exton</HI> differing essentially from this, his Opinion, which is allowed to be good Law, cannot reach this.</P>
<P>The Impropriators of the Parish of <HI>Gosforth</HI> may be soon satisfied, tho' it was once denied them, from the Authorities formerly sent, that Impropriators, as well as the Parson <HI>de Communi Jure,</HI> ought to repair the Chancel, unless they can prove contrary by Custom or Composition.</P>

<P>UPON reading of your Paper which you sent inclosed to my Lord our Bishop, touching the Repairs of <HI>Gosforth</HI> Chappel, I presently observed that the Authorities therein quoted are indeed very clear and full, as to the repairing of the Mother-Church, but reach not at all to Chappels, the Burthen whereof I have always been told did lie wholly upon the Inhabitants within each such Chapplery, the Parson or Impropriators being no Way liable thereunto. However, for my better Satisfaction, I wrote to a Friend of mine in <HI>London,</HI> and requested him to consult some able Civilian about it, and send me down his Opi∣nion. The Quaere which I sent up was expressed in these very Words:</P>
<P><Q>Whether an Impropriator be obliged, of common Right, to repair and uphold the Chancels, not only of the Mother-Church, but of all the Chappels likewise within the Rectory; and whether the Di∣stinction of Chappels Parochial and Chappels of Ease make any Difference in the Case?</Q></P>
<P>The Person consulted was Dr. <HI>Exton,</HI> Chancellor to the Bishop of <HI>London,</HI> whose Opinion, under his own Hand, I here send you inclosed, hoping it will give you Satisfaction; or if not, that you will please to let me know, that so we may consider what is further to be done.</P>
<P>With my true Respects and Service to your self and your Lady, craving the Continuance of your good Prayers, I remain ever,</P>

<HEAD>Dr. <HI>EXTON</HI>'S Opinion, mention'd above.</HEAD>
<P><Q>THE Law is certain, that where there is a Mother-Church and a Chappel of Ease, or a Parochial Chappel, which makes no Difference, if the Mother-Church be out of Repair, those Inhabitants within the Chappelries shall contribute towards the Repair of that Church: But <HI>e contra</HI> neither the Im∣propriator nor Parishioners of the Mother-Church shall at all contribute towards the Repairs of those Chappels: Except either they have done it, and so suffer'd a Custom to grow upon them, or there be some Reservation so to do it in the Foundation of those Chappels.
