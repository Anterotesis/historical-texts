<P>TWO DITHYRAMBIC ODES.</P>

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE reader may perhaps think that there was no oc∣casion to give a new title to these Odes, the former denomination of Irregular being sufficient. But, ever since the days of Cowley, Irregular Odes have had more pretensions to the irregularity of chaos than to that of nature. The Author has therefore restored their an∣cient name. When a title becomes a badge of indignity, it is surely proper to refuse it. Yet titles are neither here nor there.</P>
<P>The Italians, who alone of all modern nations feel what real poetry, what real painting, what real music are, have many productions of high same under this title. The flames would have received the following pieces, had not the Author known that they have more merit than many productions, which have the honour to attain the praise of those who know nothing. But he pretends not to the exquisite spirit of Poliziano.</P>

<L>SHADES of poets blest!</L>

<L>Of glory, have possest;</L>
<L>Appear, appear, appear!</L>
<L>If yet the mortal vow ye hear,</L>
<L>O hither, from your mansions bright,</L>
<L>O hither bend your speedy flight;</L>
<L>While light and odours float around,</L>
<L>And harps unseen empyreal airs resound.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Say, from what living spring</L>
<L>Descends the flood of fame,</L>
<L>That bears your sacred strains along</L>
<L>The vales and echoing mountains o'er</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="4"/>Of each admiring shore;</L>
<L>While empires all prolong,</L>
<L>In every varied speech, the wonders of your song;</L>
<L>And languages, that have as yet no name,</L>
<L>Their tributary rills shall bring</L>
<L>To swell the lordly stream?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Say, from what mighty cause</L>
<L>Is heard the high applause,</L>
<L>That you the distant climes,</L>
<L>That you the distant times,</L>
<L>With adoration have confest</L>
<L>Gods of the human breast;</L>
<L>And, moved with filial awe,</L>
<L>Have bent their sense and feeling to your law;</L>
<L>And noblest homage brought,</L>
<L>The homage of the thought?</L>
<L>Enthusiasm was that spring!</L>
<L>Enthusiasm was the cause</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="5"/>Why heard that high applause!</L>
<L>Enthusiasm, race divine! did all those honours bring!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ye chief of former days, whose daring vows addressed</L>
<L>Nature ere hid in Fashion's speckled vest;</L>
<L>When she, great goddess, in her prime,</L>
<L>Her virgin fancies played at will,</L>
<L>Fancies surpassing mortal skill;</L>
<L>And with her sons held colloquy sublime,</L>
<L>By hallowed fount with verdant gloom o'ergrown,</L>
<L>Or in the whispering vale, or desert mountain lone;</L>
<L>While forms of heaven not unseen</L>
<L>With fairy footsteps paced the green,</L>
<L>And in mystic notes conveyed</L>
<L>Things secret from the human thought or eye.</L>
<L>Full oft, such is thy will, O Poesy!</L>
<L>Where vulgar minds discern nought, save the shade,</L>
<L>The wise the sun descry <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><L>Qualor di Pindo le Reine accolgo,</L>

<L>The hearer's soul restrain,</L>
<L>And bear to every Passion's distant shrine.</L>
<L>Whose thunder shook the throne</L>
<L>Of each barbaric lord;</L>

<L>Of trembling slaves adored.</L>
<L>Whose lucid art of life illumed the plan;</L>

<L>Without thy fierce controul,</L>

<L>In night the fair creation lies;</L>

<L>Thy praise may every art,</L>

<L>All deeds immortal flow.</L>

<L>Hark, hark! The sounds of conflict rise;</L>
<L>What light divine illumes that sacred field,</L>
<L>Leonidas! where thy devoted few</L>
<L>Their fatal falchions drew:</L>
<L>And of their carcases composed a shield,</L>
<L>Their country to protect from dastard enemies!</L>
<L>In Freedom's holy hand</L>
<L>Their radiant banner flew:</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="8"/>Before the godlike band</L>

<L>When bold Colombo dared the watery realm</L>
<L>A world unknown to find;</L>
<L>Enthusiasm held the helm,</L>
<L>And with fresh vigor stored his ardent mind.</L>
<L>Till rose the wished shore,</L>
<L>Where empires lost to fame before,</L>
<L>Where golden cities shone,</L>
<L>And shrines of other sacred powers;</L>
<L>Groves of new pomp, and meads of other flowers,</L>
<L>And other music from the copse was blown.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Oh goddess! if one happy clime</L>
<L>Remains yet secret from the Muse,</L>
<L>Thy blessed influence diffuse,</L>
<L>O lend thy votary thy aid sublime,</L>
<L>By art's just compass, and by fancy's gate,</L>

<L>And treasures bring unknown in former time!</L>

<L>THE violet that in the lonely stream</L>
<L>Beholds her humble head,</L>
<L>Tho saved from icy breeze or sultry beam,</L>
<L>Her fragrant leaves must shed.</L>
<L>Along the stream that fed</L>
<L>Her life, the fragrant leaves are tost,</L>
<L>Till in the ruthless ocean lost.</L>

<L>Meet emblem of man's fading joy,</L>

<L>Still hastens to the grave!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To taste the fragrance of the flower,</L>
<L>And not the flower destroy,</L>
<L>Is wisdom. Haste, the fleeting hour</L>

<L>All along the flowery level.</L>

<L>Their melancholy hours entomb;</L>
<L>And, from terror of the morrow,</L>

<L>Attend, propitious Power, my claim!</L>
<L>Do thou invading cares repell:</L>
<L>With thee, dear goddess, let me dwell,</L>
