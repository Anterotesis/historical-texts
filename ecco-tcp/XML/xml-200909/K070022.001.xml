</ARGUMENT>
<P><MILESTONE N="1485" UNIT="year"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">August 22.</NOTE> THE victory, which the
earl of Richmond gained at Bosworth over Richard the third, was entirely
decisive; being attended, as well with the total rout and dispersion of
the royal army, as with the death of the King himself. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Accession of Henry VII.</NOTE> The joy of
so great success suddenly prompted the soldiers, in the field of
battle, to bestow on their victorious general the appellation of King, which
he had not hitherto assumed; and the acclamations of <HI>Long live Henry
the seventh,</HI> by a natural and unpremeditated movement, resounded from
all quar∣ters. To bes<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ow some
appearance of formality on this species of military election, Sir William
Stanley brought a crown of ornament, which Richard wore in battle, 
<PB N="2" REF="8"/> and which had been found among the spoils; and he put it
on the head of the conqueror. Henry himself remained not in suspense,
but immediately, without hesitation, accepted of the magnificent present,
which was tendered him. He was come to the great crisis of his fortune; and
being obliged suddenly to deter∣mine himself, amidst great difficulties,
which he must have frequently revolved in his mind, he chose that party,
which his ambition suggested to him, and to which he seemed to be
conducted by his present prosperous success.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">His title to the crown.</NOTE> THERE were
many titles, on which Henry could found his right to the throne; but no one of
them free from great objections, if considered, either with respect to
justice or to policy.</P>
<P>DURING some years, Henry had been regarded as heir to the
house of Lancas∣ter, by the party attached to that family; but the title of
the house of Lancaster itself to the crown was generally esteemed to be
very ill founded. Henry the fourth, who had first raised that family to
royal dignity, had never clearly deter∣mined the foundation of his claim; and
while he plainly invaded the order of succession, he had not acknowledged
the election of the people. The Parliament had indeed often recognized the
title of the Lancastrian princes; but these votes had little authority,
being considered as instances of prudent complaisance towards a family in
possession of present power: And they had accordingly been often
reversed during the late prevalence of the house of York. Prudent men
also, who had been willing, for the sake of peace, to submit to any
established authority, desired not to see the claims of a family
revived, which must produce many con∣vulsions at present, and which
disjointed for the future the whole system of here∣ditary right. Besides;
allowing the title of the house of Lancaster to be legal, Henry himself
was not the true heir of that family; and nothing but the obsti∣nacy of
faction, which never, without the utmost reluctance, will submit to their
antagonists, could have engaged the partizans of that house to adopt the
earl of Richmond as their head. His mother indeed, Margaret, countess of
Richmond, was sole daughter and heiress of John duke of Somerset,
grandson to John of Gaunt duke of Lancaster: But the birth of the first
of the Somerset line was itself illegitimate and even adulterous. And tho'
the duke of Lancaster had obtained the legitimation of his natural children
by a patent of Richard the second, con∣firmed in Parliament; it might
justly be doubted, whether this Deed could be∣stow any title to the Crown;
since in the patent itself all the privileges conferred by it are fully
enumerated, and the succession to the kingdom, by being omitted, is
thereby tacitly excluded. In all the settlements of the crown, made during
the reigns of the Lancastrian princes, the line of Somerset had been
entirely over∣looked; and it was not till the failure of the legitimate branch,
that men had paid any attention to their claim. And to add to the general
dissatisfaction against <PB N="3" REF="9"/> Henry's title, his mother,
from whom he derived all his right, was still alive; and evidently preceded
him in the order of succession.</P>
<P>THE title of the house of York, both from the plain reason
of the case, and from the late popular government of Edward the fourth, had
obtained uni∣versally the preference in the sentiments of the people; and
Henry might engraft his claim on the right of that family, by his intended
marriage with the princess Elizabeth, the heiress of it; a marriage, which
he had solemnly promised to ce∣lebrate, and to the expectation of which he
had chiefly owed all his past successes. But many reasons di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>waded Henry from adopting this expedient. Were he to
receive the crown only in right of his spouse, his power, he knew, would be
very limited; and he must expect rather to enjoy the bare title of king by a
species of courtesy, than possess the real authority which belongs to
it. Should the princess die before him without issue, he must descend
from the throne, and give place to the next in succession: And even, if
his bed should be blest with offspring, it seemed dangerous to expect,
that filial piety in his children would prevail over the ambition of obtaining
present possession of regal power. An act of Parliament, indeed,
might be easily procured to settle the crown on him during his life, but
Henry knew how much superior the claim of succession by blood was to
the votes of an assembly<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bacon in Kennet's compleat
History, p. 579.</NOTE>, which had always been overborne by violence in the
shock of contending titles, and which had ever been more governed by the
conjunctures of the times, than by any considerations derived from reason
or public interest.</P>
<P>THERE was yet a third foundation, on which Henry might rest
his claim, the right of conquest, by his victory over Richard, the present
possessor of the crown. But besides that Richard himself was deemed
no better than an usurper, the army, which fought against him,
consisted chiefly of Englishmen; and a right of con∣quest over England
could never be established by such a victory. Nothing also would give
greater umbrage to the nation than a claim of this nature; which might be
construed as an abolition of all their rights and privileges, and the
esta∣blishment of despotic authority in the sovereign<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Bacon, p. 579.</NOTE>. William himself, the Nor∣man, tho' at the
head of a powerful and victorious army of foreigners, had at first declined
the invidious title of conqueror; and it was not till the full
esta∣blishment of his authority that he had ventured to advance so
violent and de∣structive a pretension.</P>
<P>BUT Henry knew, that there was another foundation of authority,
somewhat resembling the right of conquest, to wit, present
possession; and that this title, guarded by vigour and ability, would
be sufficient to secure perpetual possession of the throne. He had
before him the example of Henry the fourth; who, sup∣ported by no better
pretension, had subdued many insurrections, and had at last 
<PB N="4" REF="10"/> been able to transmit the crown peaceably to his
posterity. He was sensible, that this title, which had been perpetuated
thro' three successions of the family of Lancaster, might still have
subsisted, notwithstanding the preferable claim of the house of York;
had not the scepter devolved into the hands of Henry the sixth, which were
too feeble to sustain it. Instructed by these recent experiences,
Hen∣ry was determined to put himself in present possession of regal
authority; and to show all opposers, that nothing but force of arms and a
successful war would be able to expel him. His claim as heir to the house
of Lancaster he was resolved to advance; and never allow it to be
discussed: And he hoped that this title, fa∣voured by the partizans of
that family, and seconded by present power, would secure him a perpetual
and an independant authority.</P>
<P>THESE views of Henry are not exposed to much blame; because
founded on good policy, and even on a species of necessity: But there
entered into all his measures and councils another motive, which admits not
of the same apology. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">King's preju∣dice against the house of
York.</NOTE> The violent contentions, which, during so long a period, had
been maintained between the rival families of York and Lancaster, and the
many sanguinary re∣venges which they had mutually exercised on each other,
had inflamed the oppo∣site factions into a high pitch of animosity. Henry
himself, who had seen most of his near friends and relations perish in
the field or on the scaffold, and who had been exposed in his own person
to many hardships and dangers, had imbibed a violent antipathy to the York
party, which no time nor experience were ever able to efface. Instead of
embracing the present happy opportunity of abolishing these fatal
distinctions, of uniting his title with that of his spouse, and of
bestowing favour indifferently on the friends of both families; he carried
into the throne all the partialities which belong to the head of a faction, and
even the passions, which are carefully guarded against by every true
politician in that situation. To exalt the Lancastrian party, to depress
the retainers of the house of York, were still the favourite objects of his
pursuit; and thro' the whole course of his reign, he never forgot these
early prepossessions. Incapable from his natural temper of a more
enlarged and more benevolent system of policy, he exposed himself to
many present inconveniencies, by too anxiously guarding against that
future possible event, which might disjoin his title from that of the
princess, whom he espoused. And while he treated the Yorkists as
enemies, he soon ren∣dered them such, and taught them to discuss that
right to the crown, which he so carefully kept separate; and to perceive
its weakness and invalidity.</P>
<P>TO these passions of Henry, as well as to his
suspicious politics, we are to ascribe the measure, which he embraced
two days after the battle of Bosworth. Edward Plantagenet, earl of Warwic,
son to the unfortunate duke of Clarence, was detained in a species of
consinement at Sherif-Hutton in Yorkshire by the <PB N="5" REF="11"/>
jealousy of his uncle, Richard; whose title to the throne was inferior to
that of the young prince. Warwic had now reason to expect better treatment,
as he was no obstacle to the succession either of Henry or Elizabeth;
and from a boy of such tender years no danger could reasonably be
apprehended. But Sir Robert Willoughby was dispatched by Henry with orders to
take him from Sherif-Hut∣ton, to convey him to the Tower, and to retain him in
close custody<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bacon, p. 579. Polydore Virgil, p.
565.</NOTE>. The same messenger carried directions, that the princess
Elizabeth, who had been confined to the same place, should be conducted to
London, in order to meet Henry, and there celebrate her espousals.</P>
<P>HENRY himself set out for the capital, and advanced by
slow journies. Not to rouse the jealousy of the people, he took care to
avoid all appearance of mili∣tary triumph; and so to restrain the
insolence of victory, that every thing about him bore the appearance of an
established monarch, making a peaceable pro∣gress thro' his dominions,
rather than of a prince who had opened a way to the throne by force of arms. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">His joyful re∣ception in London.</NOTE> The
acclamations of the people were every whereloud, and no less sincere and
hearty. Besides the favour, naturally attending a young and victorious prince
on his accession, the nation promised themselves great felicity from
the new scene, which opened before them. During the course of near a whole
century the kingdom had been laid waste by domestic wars and convulsions;
and if at any time the noise of arms had ceased, the sound of faction and
discontent still threatened new disorders. Henry, by his marriage with
Eli∣zabeth, seemed to ensure an union of the contending titles of their
families; and having prevailed over a hated tyrant, who had anew disjointed the
succession even of the house of York, and filled his own family with
blood, an unfeigned favour was observed every where to attend him. Numerous
and splendid troops of gentry and nobility accompanied his progress. The
mayor and companies of London received him as he approached the city: The
crouds of people and citizens were zealous in their expressions of
satisfaction. But Henry, amidst these general effusions of joy,
discovered still the stateliness and reserve of his temper, which
made him scorn to court popularity: He entered London in a close chariot,
and gratified not the people with the sight of their new monarch. He went
first to St. Paul's church, where he offered up the standards, taken in the
field of battle; and sung orisons for the victory, which he had there
obtained. He departed thence to the bishop of London's palace, where lodgings
were pre∣pared for him.</P>
<P>BUT Henry did not so much neglect the favour of the people, as
to delay giving them assurance of his marriage with the princess
Elizabeth, which he <PB N="6" REF="12"/> knew to be so passionately
desired by the whole nation. On his leaving Britanny, he had artificially
dropt some hopes, that, if he should succeed in his enterprize, and
obtain the crown of England, he would espouse Anne, the heiress of that
dutchy; and the report of this engagement had already reached England, and had
begot anxiety in the people, and even in the princess Elizabeth herself.
Henry took care to dissipate these apprehensions, by solemnly
renewing, before the council and principal nobility, the promise, which he
had already given, to cele∣brate his marriage with Elizabeth. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">His corona∣tion.</NOTE> But tho' bound by
honour, as well as interest, to compleat this alliance, he was resolved to
postpone it, till the ceremony of his own coronation should be finished,
and till his title should be recognized by the Parliament. Anxious still to
support his personal and hereditary right to the throne, he dreaded lest
a preceding marriage with the princess should imply a participation of
sovereignty in her, and raise doubts of his own title by the house of
Lancaster.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Sweating sick∣ness.</NOTE> THERE raged at
that time in London, and other parts of the kingdom, a species of Malady,
unknown to any other age or nation, the Sweating sickness, which
occasioned a sudden death to great multitudes; tho' it was not propagated
by any contagious infection, but arose from the general disposition of
the air and of the hu∣man body. In less than twenty-four hours the patient
commonly died or recovered; but when the pestilence had committed ravages for
a few weeks, it was observed, either from alterations in the air, or from a
more proper regimen, which was dis∣covered, to be considerably abated<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Polydore Virgil, p. 567.</NOTE>. Preparations were then made
for the ce∣remony of Henry's coronation. In order to heighten the splendor of
that appearance, he bestowed the rank of knights banneret on twelve
persons; and he conferred peerages on three. Jasper earl of Pembroke, his
uncle, he created duke of Bedford; Thomas lord Stanley, his father-in-law, earl
of Darby; and Edward Courteney, earl of Devonshire. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">30th of Oc∣tober.</NOTE> At the coronation
likewise there appeared a new institution, which the king had
established for security as well as pomp, a band of fifty archers, who
were denominated yeomen of the guard. But lest the peo∣ple should take
umbrage at this unusual symptom of jealousy in the prince, as if it
implied a personal diffidence of his subjects, he declared the
institution to be perpe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ual. The
ceremony of coronation was performed by cardinal Bourchier, archbishop of
Canterbury.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">7th of No∣vember.</NOTE> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Parliament.</NOTE> THE Parliament being
assembled at Westminster, the majority immediately appeared to be
devoted partizans of Henry; all persons of another disposition, either
declining to stand in these dangerous times, or being obliged to
dissemble their principles and inclinations. The Lancastrian party had
every where been <PB N="7" REF="13"/> successful in the elections; and even
many of them had been returned knights and burge<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>es, who, during the prevalence of the house of York,
had been exposed to the rigour of the law, and been condemned by sentence
of attainder or outlawry. Their right to take seats in the house being
questioned, the case was referred to all the judges, who assembled in
the Exchequer Chamber, in order to deliberate on so delicate a subject. The
sentence pronounced was very prudent, and con∣tained a just temperament
between law and expediency<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bacon, p. 581.</NOTE>. They
determined, that the members attainted should forbear taking their seats
till an act were passed for the reverfal of their attainder. There was no
difficulty of obtaining this act; and in it were comprehended an hundred and
seven persons of the King's party<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Rot. Parl.
1 Hen. VII. n. 2, 3, 4.—15, 17, 26-65.</NOTE>!</P>
<P>BUT a difficulty was started of a nature still more
important. The King him∣self had been attainted; and his right of
succession to the crown might thence be exposed to some doubt. The
judges extricated themselves from this dangerous question, by a singular
position, which they established; 
<Q REND="inline">"That the crown takes away all defects and
stops in Blood; and that from the time the King assumed royal authority,
the fountain was cleared, and all attainders and cor∣ruptions of blood
discharged<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Bacon, p 581.</NOTE>."</Q>
Besides the urgent necessity of the case, which admitted of no
deliberation; the judges probably thought, that no sen∣tence of a court of
judicature ought to bar the right of succession; that the jea∣lousy of
a King towards his heir might readily occasion stretches of law and
jus∣tice against him; and that a prince might even be engaged in
unjustifiable measures during his predecessor's reign, without meriting
on that account to be excluded from the throne, which was his birth-right.</P>
<P>WITH a Parliament so obsequious as the present, the King
could not fail to obtain whatever act of settlement he was pleased to
require. He seems only to have entertained some doubts within himself on
what title he should found his pre∣tensions. In his first address
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o the Parliament he mentioned his
just title by here∣ditary right: But lest that title should not be
esteemed sufficient, he subjoined his claim by the judgment of God, who
had given him victory over his enemies in the field of battle. And again,
lest this pretension should be interpreted as assuming a right of
conquest, he ensured his subjects in the entire enjoyment of their former
properties and possessions.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Entail of the crown.</NOTE> THE entail of the
crown was drawn, according to the sense of the King, and probably in the
words, dictated by himself. He made no mention in it of the princess
Elizabeth, nor any branch of the family of York; but in other respects the
act was composed with sufficient reserve and moderation. He did not
insist, that it should contain a declaration or recognition of his
preceding right; as on <PB N="8" REF="14"/> the other hand, he avoided the
appearance of a new law or ordinance. He chose a middle course, which, as
is commonly unavoidable in such cases▪ was not en∣tirely free from
uncertainty and obscurity. It was voted, 
<Q REND="inline">"That the inheri∣tance of the crown should
rest, remain, and abide in the King<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bacon, p.
581.</NOTE>;"</Q> but whe∣ther as rightful heir, or only as present
possessor, was not determined. In like manner, the King was contented
that the succession should be secured to the heirs of his body; but
he pretended not, in case of their failure, to exclude the house of York,
or give the preference to that of Lancaster: He left that great point
ambiguous for the present; and trusted, that, if ever its determination
should become requisite, future incidents would open the way for the
decision.</P>
<P>BUT after all these precautions, the King was so little
satisfied with his own title to the crown, that, in the following year, he
applied to Rome for a con∣firmation of it; and as that court gladly laid hold
of all opportunities, which the imprudence, weakness, or necessities of
princes afford it to extend its autho∣rity, Innocent the eighth, the reigning
pope, readily granted a bull, in whatever terms the King was pleased to
desire. All Henry's titles, by succession, marriage, parliamentary
choice, even conquest, are there enumerated; and to the whole the sanction
of religion is added; excommunication is denounced against every one who
should either disturb him in the present possession, or the heirs
of his body in their future succession to the crown; and from this
penalty, no criminal, except in the article of death, can be absolved but by
the pope himself, or his special commissioners. It is difficult to
imagine, that the security derived from this bull, could be a compensation
for the defect which it betrayed in Henry's title, and to the danger of thus
inviting the pope to interpose in these concerns.</P>
<P>IT was natural, and even laudable in Henry to reverse the
attainders, which had passed against the partizans of the house of
Lancaster: But the revenges, which he exercised against the retainers of
the York family, to which he was so soon to be allied, cannot be
considered in the same light. Yet the Parliament, at his instigation,
passed an act of attainder against the late King himself, against the
duke of Norfolk, the earl of Surrey, viscount Lovel, the lords Zouche and
Fe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rars of Chartley, Sir Walter and
Sir James Harrington, Sir William Berkeley, Sir Humphrey Stafford, Catesby,
and about twenty other gentlemen, who had fought on Richard's side in the
battle of B sworth. How men could be guilty of treason, by supporting the
King in possession against the earl of Richmond, who assumed not
the title of King, it was not easy to deter∣mine, and nothing but a servile
complaisance in the Parliament could have en∣gaged them to make this
stretch of justice. Nor was it a small mortification to 
<PB N="9" REF="15"/> the people in general, to find, that the King, prompted
either by avarice or re∣sentment, could, in the very beginning of his reign,
so far violate the cordial union, which had been previously concerted
between the parties, and to the ex∣pectation of which he had plainly owed his
accession to the throne.</P>
<P>THE King, having gained so many points of consequence from
his Parliament, thought it not expedient to demand any supply from them,
which the profound peace enjoyed by the nation, and the late forfeitures of
Richard's adherents, seemed to render somewhat superfluous. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">10th of De∣cember.</NOTE> The Parliament,
however, conferred on him during life the duty of tonnage and poundage, which
had been enjoyed in the same manner by some of his immediate predec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssors; and they added, before they
broke up, other lucrative bills of no great moment. The King, on his part, made
some returns of grace and favour to his people. He published his royal
proclamation, offering pardon to all such as had taken arms, or formed any
attempts against him; provided they submitted themselves to mercy by a
certain day, and took the usual oath of fealty and allegiance. Upon this
proclamation many came out of their sanctuaries, and the minds of men were
every where much quieted. Henry chose to take wholly to himself the merit
of an act of grace, so agreeable to the nation; rather than communicate it
with the Parliament, (as was his first intention) by passing a bill to
that purpose. The earl of Surrey, how∣ever, tho' he had submitted, and
delivered himself into the King's hands, was sent prisoner to the
tower.</P>
<P>DURING this parliament, the King also bestowed favours and
honours on some particular persons, who were attached to him. Edward
Stafford, eldest son to the duke of Buckingham, forfeited in the late
reign, was restored to all the honours of his family, as well as to all its
fortune, which was very ample. This genero∣sity, so unusual in Henry, was
the effect of his gratitude to the memory of Buckingham, who had first
concerted the plan of his succession to the crown, and who by his own
ruin had made way for that great event. Chandos of Bri∣tanny was created earl
of Bath, Sir Giles Daubeny lord Daubeny, and Sir Robert Willoughby lord Broke.
These were all the titles of nobility, conferred by the King<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Polydore Virgil, p. 566.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT the ministers, whom the King most trusted and
favoured, were not chosen from among the nobility, or even from among the
laity. John Morton, and Richard Fox, two clergymen, persons of industry,
vigilance, and capacity, were the men to whom he most confided his affairs
and secret councils. They had shared with him all his former dangers and
distresses; and he now forgot not to make them participate in his good
fortune. They were both called to the privy <PB N="10" REF="16"/> council; and
Morton was created bishop of Ely, Fox of Exeter. The former soon after,
upon the death of Bourchier, was raised to the see of Canterbury. The
latter was made lord privy seal; and successively, bishop of Bath and
Wells, Durham, and Winchester. For Henry, as lord Bacon observes, loved to
employ and advance prelates, because, having rich bishoprics to bestow,
it was easy for him to reward their services: And it was his maxim to
raise them by slow steps, and make them first pass thro' the inferior
bishoprics<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bacon, p. 582. Bacon adds, that the King's
reason for these gradual promotions, was in order to enjoy the more first
fruits; not reflecting that these belonged not to the crown, till after the
reformation.</NOTE>. He probably expected, that as they were naturally more
dependant on him than the nobility, who, dur∣ing that age, enjoyed
possessions and jurisdictions dangerous to royal authority; so the
prospect of some farther elevation would render them still more active in
his service, and more obsequious to his commands.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1486" UNIT="year"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">18th of Janu∣ary.</NOTE> IN presenting the
bill of tonnage and poundage, the Parliament, anxious topreserve the true and
undisputed succession to the crown, had petitioned Henry, with
demonstrations of the greatest earnestness, to espouse the
princess Elizabeth; but they covered their real reason under the dutiful
pretence of their desire to have heirs of his body. He now thought in
earnest of satisfying the minds of his peo∣ple in that particular. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">King's mar∣riage.</NOTE> His marriage was
celebrated at London; and that with greater appearance of universal joy, than
either his first entry or his coronation. Henry remarked with much
displeasure this general favour which was borne the house of York. The
suspicions, which arose from it, not only disturbed his tranquillity
during his whole reign; but bred disgust towards his spouse herself,
and poysoned all his domestic enjoyments. Tho' virtuous, amiable, and
obse∣quious to the last degree, she never met with a proper return of
affection, or even of complaisance from her husband; and the malignant
ideas of faction still, in his sullen mind, prevailed over all the
sentiments of conjugal tenderness.</P>
<P>THE King had been carried along with such a tide of
success ever since his ar∣rival in England, that he thought nothing could
withstand the fortune, and au∣thority which attended him. He now resolved
to make a progress into the North, where the friends of the house of York,
and even the partizans of Richard were most numerous; in hopes of curing, by
his presence and conversation, the prejudices of the malecontents. When he
arrived at Nottingham, he heard that viscount Lovel, with Sir Humphry
Stafford and Thomas, his brother, had withdrawn themselves secretly from
their sanctuary at Colchester: But this news appeared not to him of such
importance as to stop his journey; and he proceeded forward to York. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An insurrec∣tion.</NOTE> He there heard,
that the Staffords had levied an army in the <PB N="11" REF="17"/> county of
Worcester, and were approaching to besiege that city: And that Lovel, at
the head of an army of three or four thousand men, was marching to attack him
in York. Henry was not dismayed with this intelligence. His active cou∣rage,
full of resources, immediately prompted him to find the proper remedy. Tho'
he knew himself to be surrounded with enemies in these disaffected
counties, he assembled a small body of troops, in whom he could confide;
and he put them under the command of the duke of Bedford. He joined to them all
his own at∣tendants; but he found that this hasty armament was more
formidable by their spirit and their zealous attachment to him, than by the
arms or military stores of which they were provided. He therefore gave
Bedford orders not to approach the enemy; but previously to try every proper
expedient to dissipate them. Bedford published a general promise of
pardon to the rebels, which had a greater effect on their leader than on his
followers. Lovel, who had undertaken an enterprize, that exceeded his courage
and capacity, was so terrified with the fears of desertion among his
troops, that he suddenly withdrew himself, and, after lurking some time
in Lancashire, he made his escape into Flanders, where he was protected by
the dutchess of Burgundy. His army submitted to the King's clemency; and
the other insurgents, hearing of this success, raised the siege of
Worcester, and dis∣persed themselves. The Staffords took sanctuary in
the church of Colnham, a vil∣lage near Abingdon; but as it was found, that that
church had not the privilege of giving protection to rebels, they were taken
thence: The eldest Stafford was executed at Tyburn; the younger, pleading
that he was misled by his brother, obtained his pardon<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Polydore Virgil, p. 569.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">20th of Sep∣tember.</NOTE> HENRY'S joy for
this success was followed, some time after, with the birth of a prince,
to whom he gave the name of Arthur, in memory of the famous British King of
that name, from whom, it was pretended, the family of Tudor derived their
descent.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Discontents of the people.</NOTE> THO'
Henry had been able to dissipate that hasty rebellion, which was raised
by the relicts of Richard's parrizans, his government was become in general
very unpopular: The source of the public discontent arose chiefly from
his preju∣dice against the house of York, which was universally beloved
by the nation, and which, for that very reason, became every day more the
object of his hatred and jealousy. Not only a preference on all occasions,
it was observed, was given to the Lancastrians; but many of the opposite
party had been exposed to great severity, and had been bereaved of their
fortunes by acts of attainder. A general resumption likewise had passed
of all grants made by the princes of the house of York; and tho' this rigour
had been covered under the pretence, that the revenue <PB N="12" REF="18"/> was
become insufficient to support the crown, and tho' the liberalities, during
the latter years of Henry the sixth, were resumed by the same law, yet
the York∣party, as they were the principal sufferers by the resumption,
thought it chiefly levelled against them. The severity, exercised
against the earl of Warwic, begot compassion towards youth and innocence,
exposed to such oppression; and his confinement in the tower, the very
place where Edward's children had been mur∣dered by their uncle, made the
public expect a like catastrophe for him, and led them to make a comparison
between Henry and that detested tyrant. And when it was remarked, that the
queen herself met with harsh treatment, and even after the birth of a
son, was not admitted to the honour of a public coronation, Henry's
prepossessions were then concluded to be absolutely incurable, and
men became equally obstinate in their disgust against his government.
Nor was the manner and address of the King calculated to cure these
prejudices contracted against his administration; but had, in every thing,
a tendency to promote fear, or at best reverence, rather than good will and
affection<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bacon, p. 583.</NOTE>. And while the high
idea, en∣tertained of his policy and vigour, retained the nobility and men of
character in obedience; the effects of his unpopular government soon appeared
in the public, by incidents of a very extraordinary nature.</P>
<P>THERE lived in Oxford, one Richard Simon, a priest, who
possessed some subtlety, and still more boldness and temerity.
This man had entertained the design of disturbing Henry's government, by
raising up a pretender to his crown; 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lambert Sim∣nel.</NOTE> and for that
purpose, he cast his eyes on Lambert Simnel, a youth of fifteen years of
age, who was son of a baker, and who, being endowed with under∣standing
above his years, and address above his condition, seemed well fitted to
personate a prince of royal extraction. A report had been spread among the
peo∣ple, and received with great avidity, that Richard, duke of York, second
son to Edward the fourth, had, by a secret escape, saved himself from
his uncle's cruelty, and lay somewhere concealed in England. Simon, taking
advantage of this rumour, had at first instructed his pupil to assume
that name, which he found to be so fondly cherished by the public: But
hearing afterwards a new report, that Warwic had made his escape from the
tower, and observing that this news was attended with no less general
satisfaction, he changed the plan of his imposture, and made Simnel
personate that unfortunate prince<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Polydore
Virgil, p. 569, 570.</NOTE>. Tho' the youth was qua∣lified by nature for the
part which he was instructed to act; yet was it remarked, that he was better
informed in circumstances relating to the royal family, and par∣ticularly in
the adventures of the earl of Warwic, than he could be supposed to have
learned from one of Simon's condition: And it was thence conjectured, that 
<PB N="13" REF="19"/> persons of higher rank, partizans of the house of
York, had laid the plan of this conspiracy, and had conveyed proper
instructions to the actors. The queen dow∣ager herself was exposed to
great suspicion; and it was indeed the general opinion, however unlikely it
might seem, that she had secretly given her consent to this
imposture. This woman was of a very restless disposition. That
character of ambition and intrigue, which she had betrayed during the reign
of her husband, had not abandoned her during the usurpation of Richard; and
in her closet was first laid the plan of that great confederacy, which
overturned the throne of the ty∣rant, and raised the earl of Richmond to
royal dignity. Finding, that, instead of receiving the reward of these
services, she herself was fallen to absolute insig∣nificance, her
daughter treated with severity, and all her friends brought under
sub∣jection, she had conceived the most violent animosity against
Henry, and had re∣solved to make him feel the effects of her resentment.
The impostor, she knew, however succes<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ful, it would be easy at last to set aside; and if a way
could be found at his risque to subvert the King's government, she hoped
that a scene would be opened, which, tho' difficult at present exactly to
foresee, would gratify her revenge, and be on the whole less irksome to
her than that slavery and contempt, to which she was reduced<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Polydore Virgil, p. 570.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT whatever care Simon might take to convey instruction to
his pupil, Simnel, he knew, that the imposture would not bear a cl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se inspection; and he was
there∣fore determined to open the first public scene of it in Ireland. That
island, which was zealously attached to the house of York, and bore an
affectionate regard to the memory of Clarence, Warwick's father, who had been
their lieutenant, was improvidently allowed by Henry to remain in the same
condition, in which he found it; and all the councellors and officers, who had
been appointed by his pre∣decessor, still retained their authority. No
sooner did Simnel present himself to Thomas Fitzgerald, earl of Kildare,
the deputy, and claim his protection, as the unfortunate Warwic, than that
credulous nobleman, not suspecting so bold a fiction, lent attention to
him, and began to consult some persons of rank with regard to this
extraordinary incident. These he found even more sanguine in their zeal and
belief than himself: And in proportion a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the story diffused itself among those of lower
condition, it became the object of still higher passion and credulity;
till the people in Dublin with one consent tendered their allegiance to
Simnel as to the true Plantagenet. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Revolt of Ire∣land.</NOTE> Fond of a novelty,
which flattered their natural propen∣sion, they overlooked the daughters of
Edward the fourth, who stood before Warwic in the order of Succession;
they payed the pretended prince attendance as their sovereign, lodged him in
the castle of Dublin, crowned him with a diadem taken from a statue of the
virgin, and publicly proclaimed him King, under the ap∣pellation 
<PB N="14" REF="20"/> of Edward the sixth. The whole island followed the
example of the capital; and not a sword was any where drawn in Henry's
quarrel.</P>
<P>WHEN this intelligence was conveyed to Henry, it reduced him to
some per∣plexity. Determined always to face his enemies in person, he yet
scrupled at pre∣sent to leave England, where he suspected the
conspiracy was first framed, and where, he knew, many persons of
condition, and the people in general were much disposed to lend it
countenance. In order to discover the secret source of the con∣trivance,
and take measures against this open revolt, he held frequent
consulta∣tions with his ministers and counsellors, and laid plans for a
vigorous defence of his authority, and the suppression of his
enemies.</P>
<P>THE first event, which followed these deliberations, gave
great surprize to the public: It was the seizure of the queen dowager, the
forfeiture of all her lands and revenue, and the close confinement of her
person to the nunnery of Bermon∣desey. So arbitrary and violent an act of
authority was covered with a very thin pretence. It was alledged, that,
notwithstanding the secret agreement to marry her daughter to Henry, she
had yet yielded to the sollicitations and menaces of Richard, and delivered
that princess and her sisters into the hands of the tyrant. This crime,
which was now become obsolete, and might admit of many allevia∣tions, was
therefore suspected not to be the real cause of the severity, with
which she was treated; and men believed, that the King, unwilling to accuse
so near a relation of a conspiracy against him, had cloaked his vengeance
or precaution under the pretext of an offence, known to the whole world<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bacon, p. 583. Polydore Virgil, p. 571.</NOTE>. They were
after∣wards the more confirmed in this suspicion, when they found, that the
unfortunate queen, tho' she survived this disgrace several years, was
never treated with any more lenity, but was allowed to end her life in poverty,
solitude, and confinement. This woman had been raised to the throne from a
very private station; possessed great authority during her
husband's life-time; fell afterwards into the deepest distress; saw
the murder of all her male children; had again the satisfaction of
contributing to the exaltation of her daughter; an event which immediately
in∣volved her in vexation, and soon after in misery: And on the whole,
she furnishes ample materials for reflections on the instability of
fortune; reflections, which history, as it relates the adventures of the
great, does more frequently suggest than even the incidents of common
life.</P>
<P>THE next measure of the King was of a less exceptionable
nature. He ordered that Warwic should be taken from the Tower, be led in
procession through the streets of London, be conducted to St. Paul's, and
there exposed to the eyes of <PB N="15" REF="21"/> the whole people. He even
gave directions, that some persons of condition, who were attached to the
house of York, and were best acquainted with the person of this prince,
should approach him and converse with him: And he trusted, that these,
being convinced of the absurd imposture of Simnel, would put a stop to
the credulity of the people. The expedient had its effect in England: But in
Ireland the people still persisted in their revolt, and zealously
retorted on the King the reproach of propagating an imposture, and of having
shown a counterfeit Warwic to the people.</P>
<P>HENRY had soon reason to apprehend, that the design
against him was not laid on such slight foundations as the absurdity of
the contrivance seemed to pro∣mise. John earl of Lincoln, son of John de
la Pole, duke of Suffolk, and of Elizabeth, eldest sister to Edward the
fourth, was engaged to take part in the conspiracy. This nobleman, who
possest capacity and courage, had entertained very aspiring views; and
his ambition was encouraged by the known intentions of his uncle, Richard, who
had formed a design, in cafe himself should die without issue, of
declaring Lincoln successor to the crown. The King's jealousy against
all eminent persons of the York-party, and his rigour towards Warwic, had
far∣ther struck Lincoln with apprehensions, and made him resolve to
seek for safety in the most dangerous councils. Having fixed a secret
correspondence with sir Thomas Broughton, a man of great interest in
Lancashire, he set out for Flan∣ders, where Lovel had arrived a little
before him; and he joined the court of his aunt, the dutchess of Burgundy, by
whom he had been invited over.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Intrigues of the dutchess of
Burgundy.</NOTE> MARGARET, widow of Charles the bold, duke of Burgundy, having
born no children to her husband, attached herself with an entire
friendship to her daughter-in-law, married to Maximilian, archduke of
Austria; and after the death of that princess, she persevered in her
affection to Philip and Margaret, her children, and occupied herself in their
education and in the care of their persons. By her virtuous conduct and
demeanour, she had acquired great authority among the Flemings; and lived
with much dignity, as well as oeconomy, upon that ample dowry, which she
inherited from her husband. The resentments of this princess were no
less warm than her friendships; and that spirit of faction, which it is
so difficult for a social and sanguine temper to guard against, had
taken strong pos∣session of her heart, and entrenched somewhat on
the probity, which shone forth in other parts of her character. Hearing of
the malignant jealousy, entertained by Henry against her family, and his
oppression of all its partizans; she was moved with the highest
indignation, and determined to make him repent of that enmity, which he
seemed so wantonly to court. After consulting with Lincoln 
<PB N="16" REF="22"/> <MILESTONE N="1487" UNIT="year"/> and Lovel, she hired a
body of two thousand veteran Germans, under the com∣mand of Martin Swart, a
brave and experienced officer<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Polydore Virgil, p. 572,
573.</NOTE>; and sent them over, together with these two noblemen, to join
Simnel in Ireland. The countenance, given by persons of such high
condition, and the accession of this military force, raised extremely the
courage of the Irish, and made them entertain the resolution of invading
England, where they believed the spirit of disaffection to prevail as much
as it had appeared to do in Ireland. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lambert Sim∣nel invades England.</NOTE> The
poverty also, under which they laboured, made it impossible for them to
maintain any longer their new court and army, and inspired them with a
strong desire of enriching themselves by plunder and preferment in
England.</P>
<P>HENRY was not ignorant of these intentions of his enemies; and
he prepared himself for resistance. He ordered troops to be mustered in
different parts of the kingdom, and put them under the command of the duke of
Bedford, and the earl of Oxford. He confined from jealousy the marquis of
Dorset, who was brother to the queen regent; and who, he suspected, would
revenge the injuries suffered by his sister. And to allure the people by
an appearance of devotion, he made a pilgrimage to our lady of Walsingham,
famous for miracles; and there offered up prayers for success and for
deliverance from his enemies.</P>
<P>BEING informed that Simnel and his forces were landed at Foudrey
in Lanca∣shire, he drew together his own troops, and advanced towards them as
far as Co∣ventry. The rebels had entertained hopes, that the disaffected
counties in the North would rise in their favour: But the people, averse to
join Irish and German invaders, convinced of Lambert's imposture, and kept
in awe by the King's re∣putation for success and conduct, either remained
in tranquillity, or gave all assistance to the royal army. The earl of
Lincoln, therefore, who commanded the rebels, finding no hopes but in speedy
victory, was determined to bring the matter to a decision; and the King,
supported by the native courage of his tem∣per, and emboldened by a great
accession of volunteers, which had joined him, under the earl of
Shrewsbury and lord Strange, declined not the combat. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">6th of June.</NOTE> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Battle of Stoke.</NOTE> The opposite armies
met at Stoke in the county of Nottingham, and fought a battle, which was more
bloody and more obstinately disputed than could have been ex∣pected from
the inequality of their force. All the leaders of the rebels were re∣solved
to conquer or to die, and they inspired their troops with a like
resolution. The Germans also, being veteran and experienced soldiers,
kept the victory long doubtful; and even the Irish, tho' ill-armed and
almost defenceless, showed themselves not defective in spirit and
bravery. The King's victory was purchased <PB N="17" REF="23"/> with loss,
but was entirely decisive. Lincoln, Broughton and Swart perished in the
field of battle, with four thousand of their troops. Lovel, never having been
heard of more, was believed to have undergone the same fate. Simnel with his
tutor, Simon, was taken prisoner. Simon, being a priest, was not tried at
law, and was only committed to close custody: Simnel was too contemptible
either to ex∣cite apprehension or resentment in Henry. He was pardoned, and
made a scullion in the King's kitchen; whence he was afterwards advanced to
the rank of a falconer<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bacon, p. 586. Pol. Virg. p.
574.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>HENRY had now leisure to revenge himself of his enemies. He
took a pro∣gress into the northern parts, where he made the people fully
sensible of the rigours of his justice. A strict inquiry was made after
those who had assisted or favoured the rebels. The punishments were
not all sanguinary. The King made his revenge subservient to his avarice.
Heavy fines were levied from the delin∣quents. In giving sentence, the
proceedings of the courts, and even the courts themselves, were entirely
arbitrary. Either the criminals were tried by commis∣sioners appointed for
that purpose, or they suffered punishment by sentence of a court
martial. And as a rumour had prevailed before the battle of Stoke, that the
rebels had gained the victory, that the King's army was cut in pieces, and that
the King himself had escaped by flight, Henry was resolved to interpret
the belief or propagation of this report as a mark of disaffection; and he
punished many for that pretended crime. But such, in this age, was the
situation of the English government, that the royal prerogative, which was
but little restrained during the most peaceable periods, was sure, in
tumultuous, or even suspicious times, which frequently occurred, to break
all bounds of law and order.</P>
<P>AFTER the King had satisfied his rigour by the punishment of
his enemies, he resolved to give contentment to the people, in a point,
which, tho' a mere cere∣mony, was very passionately desired by them. The
Queen had been married near two years, but had not yet been crowned; and this
affectation of delay had given great discontent to the public, and had been
one principal source of the disaffection which prevailed. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">25th of No∣vember.</NOTE> The King,
instructed by experience, now finished the ceremony of her coronation; and
to shew a still more gracious disposition, he gave liberty to her
uncle, the marquiss of Dorset, who had been able to clear himself of all
the crimes of which he was accused.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">State of fo∣reign affairs.</NOTE> THE King
acquired great reputation throughout all Europe by the prospe∣rous and
vigorous conduct of his domestic affairs; and as some incidents, about this
time, invited him to look abroad, and exert himself in behalf of his allies,
it will be necessary, in order to give a just account of his foreign
measures, to explain the condition of the neighbouring kingdoms; beginning
with Scotland, which lies most contiguous.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">State of Scot∣land.</NOTE> THE kingdom of
Scotland had not as yet attained that state, which distin∣guishes a
civilized monarchy, and which enables the government, by the force of its laws
and institutions alone, without any extraordinary capacity in the
sove∣reign, to maintain itself in order and tranquillity. James the third,
who now filled the throne, was a man of little industry and of a narrow
genius; and tho' it behoved him to yield the reins of government to his
ministers, he had never been able to make any choice, which could give
contentment both to himself and to his people. When he bestowed his
confidence on any of the principal nobility, he found, that they exalted their
own family to such a height, as was dangerous to the prince, and gave umbrage
to the state: When he conferred favour on any person of meaner birth, on
whose submission he could more depend, the barons of his kingdom,
enraged at the power of an upstart minion, proceeded to the utmost 
<PB N="19" REF="25"/> extremities against their sovereign. Had Henry
entertained the ambition of con∣quests, a tempting opportunity now offered of
reducing that kingdom to subjec∣tion; but as he was probably sensible,
that a warlike people, tho' they might be over-run by reason of their
domestic divisions, could not be retained in obedience without a regular
military force, which was then unknown in England, he rather proposed the
renewal of the peace with Scotland, and sent an embassy to James for that
purpose. But the Scotch, who never desired a long peace with England, and
who thought that their security consisted in preserving themselves
constantly in a warlike posture, would not agree to more than a seven
years truce, which was accordingly concluded<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Polyd.
Virg. p. 575.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE European states on the continent were then hastening
fast to that situa∣tion, in which they have remained, without any material
alterations, for near three centuries; and began to unite themselves into one
extensive system of policy, which comprehended the chief powers of
Christendom. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">State of Spain.</NOTE> Spain, which had
hi∣thertobeen almost entirely occupied within herself, now became
formidable by the union of Arragon and Castile, in the persons of Ferdinand
and Isabella, who, being princes of great capacity, employed their force in
enterprizes the most ad∣vantageous to their combined monarchy. The conquest
of Granada over the Moors was then undertaken, and brought near to a happy
conclusion. And in that expedition the military genius of Spain was revived;
honour and security were attained; and her princes, no longer held in fear by
a domestic enemy so dangerous, began to enter into all the transactions
of Europe, and make a great figure in every war and negotiation.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Low Countries.</NOTE> MAXIMILIAN, King
of the Romans, son to the emperor Frederic, had, by his marriage with the
heiress of the house of Burgundy, acquired an interest in the low country
provinces; and tho' the death of his spouse had weakened his connexion with
that territory, he still pretended to the government as tutor to his son
Philip, and his authority had been acknowledged by Brabant, Holland, and
several of the provinces. But as Flanders and Hainault still refused to
submit to his regency, and even appointed other tutors to Philip, he had been
engaged in long wars against those obstinate people, and never was able
thoroughly to subdue their spirit. That he might free himself from the
opposition of France, he had concluded a peace with Lewis the eleventh, and
had given his daughter, Marga∣ret, then an infant, in marriage to the Dauphin;
together with Artois, Franche∣comté, and Charolois as her dowry. But
this alliance had not produced the desired effect. The dauphin succeeded to
the crown of France under the appel∣lation <PB N="20" REF="26"/> of Charles the
eighth; but Maximilian still found the mutinies of the Flemings fomented by
the intrigues of the Court of France.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">State of France.</NOTE> FRANCE, during the
two preceding reigns, had made a mighty encrease in power and greatness;
and had not other states of Europe at the same time received an
accession of force, it had been impossible to have retained her within
her an∣tient boundaries. Most of the great fiefs, Normandy, Champagne, Anjou,
Dauphiny, Guienne, Provence, and Burgundy had been united to the crown; the
English had been expelled from all their conquests; the authority of the
prince had been raised to such a condition as enabled him to maintain law
and or∣der; a considerable military force was kept on foot, and the finances
were able to support them. Lewis the eleventh indeed, from whom many of
these advantages were derived, was dead, and had left his son, in very
early youth and ill educated, to sustain the weight of the monarchy: But
having entrusted the government to his daughter, Anne Lady of Beaujeu, a
woman of spirit and capacity, the French power suffered no check or
decline. On the contrary, this princess formed the great project, which at
last she happily effected, of uniting to the crown Britanny, the last and
most independent fief of the monarchy.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Of Britanny.</NOTE> FRANCIS the second,
duke of Britanny, was a good, but a weak prince, who, conscious of his own
unfitness for government, had resigned himself entirely to the direction
of Peter Landais, a man of very mean birth, more remarkable for his ability
than for his virtue or integrity. The nobles of Britanny, displeased with
the great advancement of this favourite, had even proceeded to disaffection
against their sovereign; and after many tumults and conspiracies, they at
last united among themselves, and in a violent manner, seized, tried, and
put to death the obnoxious minister. Fearing the resentment of the prince
for this invasion of his authority, many of them retired to France; and
others, for their protection and safety, maintained a correspondence with
that court. The French ministry, observing the great dissentions among
the Bretons, thought the opportunity fa∣vourable for invading that dutchy; and
so much the more, that they could cover their ambition under the specious
pretence of providing for domestic security.</P>
<P>LEWIS, duke of Orleans, first prince of the blood, and
presumptive heir of the monarchy, had disputed the administration with
the lady of Beaujeu; and tho' his pretensions had been rejected by the
states, he still maintained cabals with many of the grandees, and laid
schemes for subverting the authority of that princess. Finding his
schemes detected, he took arms, and fortified himself in Beaugenci; but as
his revolt was precipitate, before his confederates were ready to rise with
him, he had been obliged to submit, and to receive whatever conditions the
French ministry were pleased to impose upon him. Actuated however by his
ambition, and even by his fears, he soon retired out of France, and took
shelter with the <PB N="21" REF="27"/> dexcl=Yke of Britanny, who was
desirous of strengthening himself against the designs of the lady of
Beaujeu by the friendship and credit of the duke of Orleans. This prince
also, observing the ascendant which he soon acquired over the duke of
Bri∣tanny, had engaged many of his partizans to join him at that court, and had
formed the design of aggrandizing himself by a marriage with Anne, the
heiress of that opulent dutchy.</P>
<P>THE barons of Britanny, who saw all favour engrossed by
the duke of Orleans and his train, renewed a stricter correspondence with
France, and even invited the French King to make an invasion on their
country. Desirous however to pre∣serve its independancy, they had regulated
the number of succours, which France was to send, and had stipulated that
no fortified place in Britanny should remain in the possession of
that monarchy. A vain precaution, where revolted subjects treat with a power
so much superior! 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">French inva∣sion of Bri∣tanny.</NOTE> The
French invaded Britanny with forces three times more numerous than those
which they had promised to the barons; and advancing into the heart of the
country, laid siege to Ploermel. To oppose them, the duke raised a
numerous, but ill-disciplined army, which he put under the command of the
duke of Orleans, the count of Dunois, and others of the French nobility. The
army, discontented with this choice, and jealous of their confederates,
soon disbanded, and left their prince with too small a force to keep the
field against his invaders. He retired to Vannes; but being hotly pursued
by the French, who had made themselves masters of Ploermel, he escaped to
Nantz; and the enemy, having taken and garrifoned Vannes, Dinant, and other
places, laid close siege to that city. The barons of Britanny, finding
their country me∣naced with total subjection, began gradually to withdraw
from the French army, and make peace with their sovereign.</P>
<P>THIS desertion, however, of the Bretons discouraged not the
court of France from pursuing their favourite project of reducing Britanny to
subjection. The situation of Europe appeared very favourable to the
execution of this design. Maximilian was engaged in close alliance with the
duke of Britanny, and was even in treaty for marrying his daughter; but he was
on all occasions so necessitous of money, and at that time so
disquieted by the mutinies of the Flemings, that little effectual
assistance could be expected from him. Ferdinand was entirely occupied in
the conquest of Granada; and it was also known, that if Franexcl=Ye
resigned to him Rousillon and Cerdagne, to which he had pretensions,
she would at any time engage him to abandon the interests of Britanny.
England alone was both enabled by her power, and engaged by her interests, to
support the independency of that dutchy; and the most dangerous
opposition was therefore, by the French, expected from that quarter. In order
to cover their real designs, no sooner were they informed 
<PB N="22" REF="28"/> of Henry's success against Simnel and his partizans,
than they dispatched ambassa∣dors to the court of London, and made
professions of the utmost trust and con∣fidence in that monarch.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">French em∣bassy to Eng∣land.</NOTE> THE
ambassadors, after congratulating Henry on the late victory, and
com∣municating to him in the most cordial manner, as to an intimate friend,
some successes of their master against Maximilian, came in the
progress of their dis∣course to mention the late transactions in
Britanny. They told him that the duke of Britanny having given protection to
French fugitives and rebels, the King had been necessitated, contrary to
his intention and inclination, to carry war into that dutchy: That the honour
of the crown was interested not to suffer a vassal so far to forget
his duty to his liege lord; nor was the security of the government of France
less concerned to prevent the consequences of this dange∣rous temerity:
That the fugitives were no mean nor obscure persons; but, among others, the
duke of Orleans, first prince of the blood, who, finding himself obnoxious
to justice for treasonable practices in France, had fled into
Bexcl=Yitanny; where he still persevered in laying schemes of rebellion
against his sovereign: That the war being thus, on the part of the French
moexcl=Yarch, entirely defensive, it would immedi∣ately cease, when the
duke of Britanny, by returning to his duty, should remove the causes of it:
That their master was sensible of the obligations which that duke, in
very critical times, had conferred on Henry; but it was known also, that, in
times still more critical, he or his mercenary counsellors had deserted
him, and put his life in the utmost hazard: That his sole refuge in such
desperate extremities had been the court of France, which not only protected
his person, but supplied him with men and money, with which, aided by his
own valour and conduct, he had been enabled to mount the throne of England:
That France, in this transaction, had, from friendship to Henry, acted
contrary to what, in a narrow view, might be esteemed her own interest;
since, instead of an odious tyrant, she had contributed to establish
on a rival throne a prince endowed with such virtue and ability: And that as
both the justice of the cause and the obli∣gations conferred on Henry thus
preponderated on the side of France, their master expected, that, if the
situation of Henry's affairs allowed him not to give assist∣aexcl=Yce
to that kingdom, he would at least preserve a neutrality between the
con∣tending parties<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bacon, p. 589.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THIS discourse of the French ambassadors was
plausible; and to give it greater weight, they communicated to Henry, as in
confidence, their master's intentexcl=Yon, after he should have composed
the differences with Britanny, to lead an army into Italy, and make good his
pretensions to the kingdom of Naples: A project, <PB N="23" REF="29"/> which,
they knew, would give no umbrage to the court of England. But all these
artifices were in vain employed against the penetration of the King. He
clearly saw, that France had entertained the view of subduing Britanny; but
he also perceived, that she would meet with great, and, as he thought,
insupe∣rable difficulties in the execution of her project. The native force
of that dutchy, he knew, had always been considerable, and had often, without
any foreign assistance, resisted the power of France; the natural
temper of the French nation, he imagined, would make them easily abandon
every enterprize, which required per∣severance; and as the heir of the crown
was confederated with the duke of Britanny, the courtiers would be still more
remiss in prosecuting a scheme which must draw on them his resentment
and displeasure. Should even these internal obstructions be removed,
Maximilian, whose enmity to France was well known, and who now paid his
addresses to the heiress of Britanny, would be able to make a
di∣version on the side of Flanders; nor could it be expected, that France,
if she prosecuted such ambitious projects, would be allowed to remain in
tranquillity by Ferdinand and Isabella. Above all, he thought, the French
court could never expect, that England, so deeply interested to preserve
the independancy of Britanny, so able by her power and situation to give
effectual and prompt assist∣ance, would permit such an accession of
force to be made to her rival. He imagined, therefore, that the ministers of
France, convinced of the impractica∣bility of their schemes, would at last
embrace pacific views, and would abandon an enterprize, so obnoxious to all
the potentates of Europe.</P>
<P>THIS reasoning of Henry was solid, and might very justly
engage him in dilatory and cautious measures: But there entered into his
conduct another motive, which was apt to draw him beyond the just bounds,
because founded on a ruling passion. His frugality, which by degrees
degenerated into avarice, made him averse to all warlike enterprizes and
distant expeditions; and engaged him previously to try the expedient of
negotiation. He dispatched Urswic, his almoner, a man of address and
ability, to make offer of his mediation to the contending parties: An offer,
which, he thought, if accepted by France, would soon lead to a composure of
all differences; if refused or eluded, would at least discover the
perseverance of that court in their ambitious projects. Urswic found the
lady of Beaujeu, now dutchess of Bourbon, engaged in the siege of Nantz,
and had the satisfaction to find that his master's mediation was very
readily embraced, and with many expressions of confidence and moderation. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dissimulation of the French Court.</NOTE>
That able princess concluded, that the duke of Orleans, who governed the
court of Bri∣tanny, forseeing that every accommodation must be made at his
expence, would use all his interest to have Henry's proposal rejected;
and would by that means <PB N="24" REF="30"/> make an effectual apology for the
French measures, and draw on the Bretons the reproach of obstinacy and
injustice. The event justified her prudence. When the English
ambassador made the same applications to the duke of Britanny, he
received for answer, in name of that Prince, that having so long acted the
part of protector and guardian to Henry, during his youth and adversity, he
had ex∣pected, from a monarch of such virtue, more effectual
assistance, in his present distresses, than a barren offer of
mediation, which suspended not the progress of the French arms: That if
Henry's gratitude was not sufficient to engage him in such a measure, his
prudence, as King of England, should discover to him the pernicious
consequences attending the conquest of Britanny, and its annexation to the
crown of France: That that kingdom, already become too powerful, would be
enabled, by so great an accession of force, to display, to the ruin of
England, that hostile disposition, which had always subsisted
between those rival nations: That Britanny, so useful an ally, which, by
its situation, gave the English an entrance into the heart of France; being
annexed to that kingdom, would be equally enabled from its situation to
disturb, either by pyracies or naval arma∣ments, the commerce and peace of
England: And that if the duke refused Henry's mediation, it proceeded neither
from an inclination to a war, which he experienced to be so ruinous to him,
nor from a confidence in his own force, which he knew to be so much inferior
to that of the enemy; but merely from a sense of his present
necessity, which must engage the King to act the part of his confederate,
not of a mediator.</P>
<P>WHEN this answer was reported to the King, he abandoned not
the system of conduct which he had formed: He only concluded, that some
more time was requisite to quell the obstinacy of the Bretons and make them
submit to reason. And when he learned, that the people of Britanny, anxious
for their duke's safety, had formed a tumultuary army of 60,000 men, and had
obliged the French to raise the siege of Nantz, he fortified himself the
more in his opinion, that the court of France would at last be reduced, by
multiplied obstacles and difficulties, to abandon the project of reducing
Britanny to subjection. He con∣tinued therefore the scheme of negotiation,
and thereby exposed himself to be deceived by the artifices of the French
ministry; who, still pretending pacific intentions, sent lord Bernard
Daubigni, a Scotch man of quality, to London, and pressed Henry not to be
discouraged in offering his mediation to the court of Britanny. The King on
his part dispatched another embassy composed of Urswic, the abbot of
Abingdon and Sir Richard Tonstal, who carried new proposals for an amicable
accommodation. No effectual succours, mean while, were provided for the
distressed Bretons. The lord Woodville, brother to the queen dowager, a 
<PB N="25" REF="31"/> man of courage and enterprize, having asked leave to
raise underhand a body of volunteers and transport them into Britanny, met
with a refusal from the King, who was desirous of preserving the
appearance of a strict neutrality. That noble∣man, however, still
persisted in his intentions. He went over to the Isle of Wight, of which
he was governor; levied a body of 400 men; and having at last obtained, as is
supposed, the secret permission of Henry, sailed with them to
Britanny. This enterprize proved fatal to the leader, and brought small
relief to the unhappy Duke. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">28th of July.</NOTE> The Bretons rashly
engaged in a general action with the French at St. Aubin, and were totally
discomfited. Woodville and all the Eng∣lish were put to the sword;
together with a body of Bretons, who had been accouttered in the garb of
Englishmen, in order to strike a greater terror into the French, to whom
the martial prowess of that nation was always formidable<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Argentré Hist. de Bretagne, Liv. 12.</NOTE>. The duke of
Orleans, the prince of Orange, and many other persons of rank were taken
prisoners. And the military force of Britanny was totally dissipated. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">9th Septem∣ber.</NOTE> The death of the duke,
which followed soon after, threw affairs into still greater confusion,
and seemed to threaten the state with a final subjection.</P>
<P>THO' the King prepared not against these events, so
hurtful to the interest of England, with sufficient vigour and precaution,
he had not altogether over∣looked them. Determined to observe a pacific
conduct, as far as the situation of affairs would permit, he yet knew the
warlike disposition of his subjects, and observed, that their antient
and inveterate animosity to France was now revived by the prospect of this
great accession to its power and grandeur. He resolved therefore to make
advantage of those humours, and to draw some supplies of money from the
people, under pretext of giving assistance to the Duke of Bri∣tanny. He
had summoned a Parliament to meet at Westminster<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">9th November, 1487.</NOTE>; and he soon perswaded them to
grant him a considerable subsidy<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Polydore
Virgil, p. 579, says that this imposition was a capitation tax; the other
historians say it was a tax of two shillings on the pound.</NOTE>. But
this supply, tho' voted by Parliament, involved the King in unexpected
difficulties. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An insurrec∣tion in the North.</NOTE> The
counties of Durham and York, always discontented with Henry's government, and
far∣ther provoked by the late oppressions, under which they had laboured,
after the suppression of Simnel's rebellion, resisted the
commissioners who were ap∣pointed to levy the new tax. The
commissioners, terrified with this appear∣ance of sedition, made
application to the Earl of Northumberland, and desired of him advice and
assistance in the execution of their office. That nobleman thought the
matter of importance enough to consult the King; who, unwilling to yield to
the humours of a discontented populace, and foreseeing the per∣nicious 
<PB N="26" REF="32"/> consequences of such a precedent, renewed his orders
for a strict levy of the imposition. Northumberland summoned together the
justices and chief free∣holders, and delivered the King's commands in the
most imperious terms, which, he thought, would inforce obedience, but which
tended only to provoke the people, and make them believe him the adviser of
those orders which he de∣livered to them<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Bacon, p. 595.</NOTE>. They flew to arms, and attacked
Northumberland's house, whom they put to death. Having incurred such deep
guilt, their mutinous humour prompted them to declare against the King
himself; and being instigated by one John Achamber, a seditious fellow of
mean birth, they chose Sir John Egre∣mond their leader, and prepared
themselves for a vigorous resistance. Henry was not dismayed with an
insurrection so precipitant and ill supported. He immediately levied a
force which he put under the command of the earl of Sur∣rey, whom he had
delivered from confinement, and restored to his favour. His intention was to
send down these troops, in order to check the progress of the rebels;
while he himself should follow with a greater body, which would
abso∣lutely insure success. But Surrey thought himself strong
enough to encounter a raw and unarmed multitude; and he succeeded in the
attempt. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Suppressed.</NOTE> The rebels were
dissipated; John Achamber taken prisoner, and afterwards executed with
some of his accomplices; Sir John Egremond fled to the dutchess of
Burgundy, who gave him protection; the greater number of the rebels received
their pardon.</P>
<P>HENRY had probably expected, when he obtained this grant from
the Par∣liament, that he would be able to terminate the affair of Britanny by
negotiation, and that he might thereby fill his coffers with the money levied
by the imposition. But as the distresses of the Bretons still
multiplied, and became every day more ur∣gent; he found himself under the
necessity of taking some measures, in order to sup∣port them. On the
death of the duke, the French had revived some antiquated claims to the
dominion of the dutchy; and as the duke of Orleans was now captive in France,
their former pretext for hostilities could no longer serve as a cover to
their ambition. The King resolved therefore to engage as auxiliary to
Britanny; and to consult the interest, as well as desires of his people,
by op∣posing himself to the progress of the French power. Besides
entering into a league with Maximilian, and another with Ferdinand, which were
distant re∣sources, he levied a body of troops, to the number of 6000 men,
with an in∣tention of transporting them into Britanny.
<MILESTONE N="1489" UNIT="year"/> Still anxious, however, for the pay∣ment of
his expences, he concluded a treaty with the young dutch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ss, by which she was engaged to deliver into his
hands two sea-port towns, there to remain till she should entirely refund
the charges of the armament<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Du Tillet, Recueil des
Traitez.</NOTE>. Tho' he engaged for <PB N="27" REF="33"/> the service of
these troops during the space of eight months only, yet was the
dutches<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> obliged, by the
necessity of her affairs, to submit to such rigid conditions, imposed
by an ally, s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> much concerned in
interest to protect her. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">King send<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> forces into Britanny.</NOTE> The forces arrived under the command
of lord Willoughby of Broke; and made the Bretons, during some time,
masters of the field. The French retired into their garrisons; and
proposed by dilatory measures to waste the fire of the English, and
disgust them with their enterprize. The scheme was well laid, and met
with success. Lord Broke found such discord and confusion in the
councils of Bri∣tanny, that no measures could be concerted for any
undertaking; no supply ob∣tained; no provisions, carriages, ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>illery, or military stores procured.
The whole court was rent into factions: No one minister had acquired the
ascendant: And whatever project was formed by one, was sure to be
traversed by another. The English, disconcerted in every enterprize, by
these animosities and uncertain councils, returned home as soon as the
time of their service was elapsed; leaving only a small garrison in
those towns which had been put into their hands. During their stay in
Britanny, they had done nothing but contributed still far∣ther to waste the
country; and by their departure, they left it entirely at the mercy of the
enemy. So feeble was the succour, which Henry in this impor∣tant conjuncture
afforded his ally, whom the invasion of a foreign enemy, concur∣ring with
domestic dissensions, had reduced to the utmost distress.</P>
<P>THE great object of dissension among the Bretons was the
disposal of the young dutchess in marriage. The mareschal Rieux
seconded the suit of the lord Albert, who led some forces to her
assistance. The chancellor Montauban, observing the aversion of the
dutchess to this suitor, insisted, that a petty prince, such as
Al∣bert, was unable to support Anne in her present extremities; and he
recommended some more powerful alliance, particularly that of Maximilian,
King of the Ro∣mans. <MILESTONE N="1490" UNIT="year"/> This party at last
prevailed; the marriage with Maximilian was celebrated by proxy; and the
dutchess thenceforth assumed the title of queen of the Ro∣mans. But this
magnificent appellation was all she gained by her marriage. Maximili<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n, destitute of troops and money, and embarrassed
with the continual revolts of the Flemings, could give no assistance to
his distressed consort: While Albert, enraged at the preference given
his rival, deserted her cause, and received the French into Nantz, the
most important place in the dutchy, both for strength and riches.</P>
<P>THE French court began now to change their scheme with regard
to the sub∣ject on of Britanny. Charles had formerly been assianced to
Margaret daughter of Maximilian; who, tho' too young to consummate her
marriage, had been <PB N="28" REF="34"/> sent to Paris to be educated, and
bore at this time the title of queen of France. Besides the rich dowry, which
she brought the King, she was, after her brother, Philip, then in early
youth, heiress to the whole dominions of the house of Bur∣gundy; and
seemed in many respects the most proper match, which could be chosen
for the young monarch. These circumstances had so blinded the councils
both of Maximilian and Henry, that they never suspected any other
intentions in the French court; nor were able to discover, that engagements,
so advantageous and so solemnly entered into, could be infringed and
set aside. But Charles be∣gan to perceive, that the conquest of Britanny,
in opposition to the natives, and to all the great powers in Christendom,
would prove a very difficult enterprize; and that even, if he should over-run
the country and make himself master of the fortresses, it would be
impossible for him long to retain possession of them. The marriage
alone of the dutchess could fully re-annex that fief to the crown; and the
present and certain enjoyment of so considerable a territory seemed
preferable to the prospect of inheriting the dominions of the house of
Burgundy; a pro∣spect which became every day more distant and precarious.
Above all, the marriage of Maximilian and Anne appeared destructive to the
grandeur and even security of the French monarchy; while that prince should
possess Flanders on the one hand, and Britanny on the other, and might
thus from both quarters make inroads into the heart of the country. The only
remedy for these evils was therefore concluded to be the dissolution of
the two marriages, which had been celebrated, but not consummated; and the
espousals of the dutchess of Britanny, and the King of France.</P>
<P>THIS expedient, which had not been foreseen by any court of
Europe, and which they were, all of them, so much engaged in point of
interest to oppose, it was requisite to keep a profound secret, and
only to discover to the world by the full execution of it. The measures of
the French ministry were in the conduct of this delicate enterprize very
wise and political. While they pressed Britanny with all the rigours of
war, they secretly gained the count of Dunois, who possessed great
authority with the Bretons; and having also engaged in their interests the
prince of Orange, cousin-german to the dutchess, they gave him his liberty,
and sent him into Britanny. These persons, supported by other
emissaries of France, prepared the minds of men for the great revolution
projected, and displayed, tho' still with many precautions, all the
advantages of an union with the French monarchy. They represented to the
British barons, that their country, harrassed during so many years with
perpetual war, had need of some repose, and of a solid and lasting
peace with the only power that was formidable to them: That their alliance with
Maximilian was not able to afford them even present protection; and by 
<PB N="29" REF="35"/> uniting them closely with a power, which was rival to
the greatness of France, fixed them in perpetual enmity with that powerful
monarchy: That their near neighbourhood exposed them first to the inroads
of the enemy; and the happiest event, which in such a situation could
befal them, would be to attain peace, tho' by a final subjection to France,
and by the loss of that liberty, transmitted them from their ancestors:
And that any other expedient, compatible with the honour of the state, and
their duty to their sovereign, was preferable to a scene of such
disorder and devastation.</P>
<P>THESE suggestions had influence on the Bretons: But the
chief difficulty lay in surmounting the prejudices of the young dutchess
herself. That princess had imbibed in her education a strong prejudice
against the French nation, and par∣ticularly against Charles, who had been
the author of all the calamities, which, from her earliest infancy, had
befallen her family. She had also fixed her affec∣tions on Maximilian; and as
she now deemed him her husband, she could not, she thought, without
incurring the greatest guilt, and violating the most solemn engagements,
contract a marriage with another person. <MILESTONE N="1491" UNIT="year"/> In
order to overcome her obstinacy, Charles gave the duke of Orleans his
liberty, who, tho' formerly a suitor of the dutchess, was now contented to
ingratiate himself with the King, by employing in his favour all the
interest which he still possessed in Britanny. The mareschal
Rieux and chancellor Montauban were reconciled by his negoti∣ations; and
these rival ministers now concurred with the prince of Orange, and the
count of Dunois, in pressing the conclusion of a marriage with Charles.
From their suggestion, Charles advanced with a powerful army and invested
Rennes, at that time the residence of the dutchess; who, assailed on
all hands, and finding none to support her in her inflexibility, at last
opened the gates of the city, and agreed to espouse the King of France. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Annexation of Britanny to France.</NOTE> She
was married at Langey in Touraine; conducted to St. Denis, where she was
crowned; and thence made her entry into Paris, amidst the joyful acclamations
of the people, who regarded this marriage as the most prosperous event that
could have befallen their monarchy.</P>
<P>THE triumph and success of Charles was the most
sensible mortification to the King of the Romans. He had lost a
considerable territory, which he thought he had acquired, and an
accomplished princess whom he had espoused; he was affronted in the
person of his daughter Margaret, who was sent back to him, after being
treated during some years as queen of France; he had reason to re∣proach
himself with his own supine security, in neglecting the consummation of
his marriage, which was easily practicable for him, and which would have
ren∣dered <PB N="30" REF="36"/> the tye indissoluble: These
considerations threw him into the most violent rage, which he vented in
very indecent expressions; and he threatened France with an invasion from
the united arms of Austria, Spain, and England.</P>
<P>THE King of England had also just reason to reproach
himself with miscon∣duct in this important transaction; and tho' the
affair had terminated in a manner which he could not precisely foresee, his
negligence, in leaving so long his most useful▪ ally exposed to
the invasion of superior power, could not but appear on reflection the
result of timid caution and narrow politics. As he valued himself very much
on his extensive foresight and profound judgment, the ascendant ac∣quired
over him, by a raw youth, such as Charles, could not but give him the
highest displeasure, and prompt him to seek vengeance, after all remedy
for his miscarriage was become absolutely impracticable. But he was farther
actuated by avarice, a motive still more predominant with him than either
pride or re∣venge; and he sought even from his present disappointments,
the gratification of this ruling passion. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">7th July.</NOTE> Under pretext of a French
war, he issued a commission for levying a <HI>Benevolence</HI> on his
people<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rymer, Vol. XII. p. 446. Bacon says that the
benevolence was levied with consent of Parlia∣ment, which is a
mistake.</NOTE>; an arbitrary taxation, which had been abolished by a
recent law of Richard the third, and which was the more provok∣ing, that, tho'
really raised by menaces and extortion, it was nevertheless pre∣tended to
be given by the voluntary consent of the people. This violence fell chiefly
on the commercial part of the nation, who were possessed of the ready
money. London alone contributed to the amount of near 10,000 pounds.
Arch∣bishop Morton, the chancellor, instructed the commissioners to
employ a dilemma, in which every one might be comprehended: If the persons
applied to lived frugal∣ly, they were told, that their parsimony must
necessarily have enriched them: If their method of living was splendid

This device was by some called chancellor Mor∣ton's fork, and by others his
crutch.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">27th October.</NOTE> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Parliament.</NOTE> SO little apprehensive
was the King of a Parliament, on account of his levy∣ing this arbitrary
imposition, that he soon after summoned that assembly to meet at
Westminster; and he even expected to enrich himself farther by working on
their passions and prejudices. He knew the resentment, which the
English had con∣ceived against France, by reason of the conquest of
Britanny; and he took care to insist on that topic, in the speech, which
he himself pronounced to the Parliament. He told them, that France, elevated
with her late successes, had even proceeded to a cont mpt of England, and
had refused to pay that tribute, which Lewis the eleventh had stipulated to
Edward the fourth: That it became so warlike a <PB N="31" REF="37"/> nation as
the English to be rouzed with this indignity, and not to limit their
pretensions merely to repressing the present injury: That for his part,
he was determined to lay claim to the crown of France itself, and to maintain
by force of arms so just a title transmitted to him by his gallant
ancestors: That Cressy, Poictiers, and Agincourt were sufficient to
instruct them in their superiority over the enemy; nor did he despair of
adding new names to the glorious catalogue: That a King of France had been
prisoner at London, and a King of England had been crowned at Paris; events
which should animate them to an emulation of like glory with that enjoyed by
their forefathers: That the domestic dissensions of England had been
the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>le cause of her losing
these foreign dominions; and her present union and harmony would be the
effectual means of recovering them: That where such lasting honour was in
view, and such an important acquisition, it became not brave men to repine
at the advance of a little treasure: And that for his part, he was determined
to make the war maintain itself, and hoped, by the invasion of so opulent
a kingdom as France, to encrease, rather than diminish, the riches of the
nation<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bacon, p. 601.</NOTE></P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1492" UNIT="year"/> NOTWITHSTANDING these
magnificent vaunts of the King, all men of pene∣tration concluded, from the
personal character of the man, and still more, from the situation of his
affairs, that he had no serious intention of pushing the war to such
extremity as he pretended. France was not now in the same condition as when
such successful inroads had been made into her by the former Kings of
England. The great fiefs were united to the crown; the princes of the blood
were desirous of peace and tranquility; the kingdom abounded with able
cap∣tains and veteran soldiers; and the general aspect of its affairs
seemed more to threaten its neighbours, than to subject it to any insults
from them. The levity and vain glory of Maximilian were supported by his
pompous titles; but were ill seconded by military power, and still less,
by any revenue, proportioned to them. The politic Ferdinand, while he made a
show of war, was actually nego∣tiating for peace; and rather than expose
himself to any hazard, would accept of very moderate concessions from
France. Even England was not free from do∣mestic discontents; and in
Scotland, the death of Henry's friend and ally, James the third, who had been
murdered by his rebellious subjects, had made way for the succession of
his son, James the fourth, who was devoted to the French interest, and
would surely be alarmed with any progress of the English arms. But all
these obvious considerations had no influence with the Parliament. Inflamed
by the ideas of subduing France, and of inriching themselves with the
spoils of that <PB N="32" REF="38"/> kingdom, they gave into the snare
prepared for them, and voted the supply which the King demanded. Two
fifteenths were granted him; and the better to enable his vassals and
nobility to attend him, an act was passed, empowering them to sell their
estates, without paying any fines for alienation.</P>
<P>THE nobility were universally seized with a desire of
military glory; and hav∣ing credulously swallowed all the boasts of the
King, they dreamed of no less than carrying their triumphant arms to the
gates of Paris, and putting the crown of France on Henry's head. Many of them
borrowed large sums or sold off manors, that they might appear in the field
with greater splendour, and lead out their followers in more compleat order. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">War with France.</NOTE> The king crossed
the seas, and arrived at Calais on the sixth of October, with an army of
twenty-five thousand foot and sixteen hundred horse, which he put under
the command of the duke of Bedford and the earl of Oxford: But as some
inferred, from his opening the campaign in so late a season, that peace
would soon be concluded between the crowns, he was desirous of
suggesting a contrary inference. 
<Q REND="inline">"He had come over," he said, "to make an
entire conquest of France, which was not the work of one summer. It was
therefore of no consequence at what season he began the invasion;
espe∣cially as he had Calais ready for winter quarters."</Q> As if he had
seriously in∣tended this enterprize, he instantly marched with his army
into the enemy's coun∣try, and laid siege to Bulloigne: 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Invasion of France.</NOTE> But
notwithstanding this appearance of a hostile disposition, there had
been secret advances made towards a peace above three months before; and
commissioners had been appointed to treat of the terms. The better to
reconcile the minds of men to this unexpected measure, the king's
ambassadors arrived in the camp from the Low Countries, and informed him,
that Maximilian was in no readiness to join him; nor was any assistance
to be hoped for from that quarter. Soon after, messengers came from Spain,
and brought news of a peace concluded between that kingdom and France, in which
Charles had made a cession of the counties of Roussillon and Cerdagne
to Ferdinand. Tho' these articles of intelligence were carefully
dispersed thro' the army, the King was still apprehensive, lest a
sudden peace, after such magnificent promises and high expectations,
would expose him to great reproach. That he might more effectually cover the
intended measures, he secretly engaged the marquiss of Dor∣set,
together with twenty three persons of condition, to present him a petition
for his agreeing to a treaty with France. The pretence was founded on the late
sea∣son of the year, the difficulty of supplying the army at Calais
during winter, the obstacles which arose in the siege of Bulloigne, the
desertion of those allies whose assistance had been most relied
on: Events which might, all of them, have been foreseen before the
embarkation of the forces.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="39"/> IN consequence of these preparatory
steps, the bishop of Exeter and the lord Daubeney were sent to confer at
Estaples with the mareschal of Cordes, and to put the last hand to the
treaty. A few days sufficed for this purpose: The demands of Henry were
wholly pecuniary; and the King of France, who esteemed the peaceable
possession of Britanny an equivalent for any money, and who was all on
fire for his projected expedition into Italy, readily agreed to the proposals
made him. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">3d of No∣vember.</NOTE> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Peace with France.</NOTE> He engaged to pay
Henry seven hundred and forty-five thousand crowns, about one hundred and
eighty-six thousand two hundred and fifty pounds sterling; partly as a
reimbursement of the sums advanced for Britanny, partly as arrears of the
pension due to Edward the fourth. And he stipulated a yearly pension to
Henry and his heirs of twenty-five thousand crowns. Thus the King, as
remarked by his historian, made profit upon his subjects for the war; and
upon his enemies for the peace<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bacon, p. 605. Pol.
Virg. p. 586.</NOTE>. And the people agreed, that he had fulfilled his
promise, when he said to the parliament, that he would make the war
maintain itself. Maximilian was comprehended in Henry's treaty, if he
pleased to accept of it; but he disdained to be in any respect beholden
to an ally, of whom, he thought, he had reason to complain: He made a
separate peace with France, and obtained restitution of Artois,
Franchecomte and Charolois, which had been given as the dowry of his daughter,
when she was affianced to the King of France.</P>
<P>THE peace, concluded between England and France, was the more
likely to continue, that Charles, full of ambition and youthful hopes, bent all
his atten∣tion to the side of Italy, and soon after undertook the
conquest of Naples; an enterprize, which Henry regarded with the greater
indifference, that Naples lay remote from him, and France had never, in any
age, been successful on that quarter. The King's authority was fully
established at home; and every rebellion, which had been attempted
against him, had hitherto tended only to confound his enemies, and
consolidate his power and influence. His reputation for policy and conduct
was every day augmenting; his treasures had encreased even from the most
unprosperous events; the hopes of all pretenders to his throne were cut off,
as well by his marriage, as by the issue which it had brought him. In this
pro∣mising situation, the King had reason to flatter himself with the
prospect of a durable peace and tranquillity: But his inveterate and
indefatigable enemies, whom he had wantonly provoked, raised up to him an
adversary, who kept him long in inquietude, and sometimes even brought him
into danger.</P>
<P>THE dutchess of Burgundy, full of resentment for the
depression of her family and its partizans, rather irritated than
discouraged with the bad success of her past <PB N="34" REF="40"/>
enterprizes, was determined at least to disturb that government, which
she found it so difficult to subvert. By means of her emissaries,
she propagated the report, that her nephew, Richard Plantagenet, duke of
York, had escaped▪ from the Tower when his elder brother was murdered,
and that he lay still somewhere concealed: And finding this rumour, however
improbable, to be greedily re∣ceived by the people, she had been looking out
for some young man, proper to personate that unfortunate prince.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Perkin War∣bec.</NOTE> THERE was one Osbec
or Warbec, a renegado Jew of Tournay, who had been carried by some
business to London in the reign of Edward the fourth, and had there a son
born to him. Having had opportunities of being known to the King, and obtaining
his favour, he prevailed with that prince, whose manners were very affable,
to stand godfather to his son, to whom he gave the name of Peter,
cor∣rupted after the Flemish manner into Peter-kin, or Perkin. It was by
some be∣lieved, that Edward, among his other amorous adventures, had had a
secret correspondence with Warbec's wife; and from this incident people
accounted for that resemblance, which was afterwards remarked between young
Perkin and that monarch<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bacon, p. 606.</NOTE>. Some
years after the birth of this child, Warbec returned to Tour∣nay; where Perkin
his son remained not long, but by different accidents was car∣ried from place
to place, and his birth and fortunes became thereby unknown, and difficult to
be traced by the most careful enquiry. The variety of his adven∣tures had
happily favoured the natural versatility and sagacity of his genius; and he
seemed to be a youth perfectly fitted to act any part, or assume any
character. In this light he had been represented to the dutchess of
Burgundy, who, struck with the concurrence of so many circumstances
suited to her purpose, desired to be made acquainted with the person,
on whom she began already to ground her hopes of success. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">His imposture.</NOTE> She found him to
exceed her most sanguine expectations; so beautiful did he appear in his
person, so graceful in his air, so courtly in his ad∣dress, so full
of docility and good sense in his behaviour and conversation. The
lessons, which were necessary to be taught him, in order to his
personating the duke of York, were soon learned by a youth of such quick
comprehension; but as the season seemed not then favourable for his
enterprize, Margaret, in order the better to conceal him, sent him, under the
care of Lady Brampton, into Por∣tugal, where he remained a year, unknown to all
the world.</P>
<P>THE war, which was then ready to break out between France and
England, seemed to afford a proper opportunity for the discovery of this
new phaenomenon; and Ireland, which still retained its attachments to the
house of York, was pitched on as the proper place for his first
appearance<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Polyd. Virg. p. 589.</NOTE>. He
landed at Corke; and im∣mediately <PB N="35" REF="41"/> assuming the name of
Richard Plantagenet, drew to him partizans among that ignorant and credulous
people. He wrote letters to the earls of Des∣mond and Kildare, inviting them
to join his party: He dispersed every where the strange intelligence of
his escape from his uncle Richard's cruelty; and men, fond of every thing new
and wonderful, began to make him the general subject of their discourse,
and even the object of their favour.</P>
<P>THE news soon reached France; and Charles, prompted by the
private sollici∣tations of the dutchess of Burgundy, and the intrigues of
one Frion, a secretary of Henry, who had deserted his service, sent
Perkin an invitation to repair to him at Paris. He received him with all the
marks of regard due to the duke of York; settled on him a handsome
pension, assigned him magnificent lodgings, and in order to provide at
once for his dignity and security, gave him a guard for his person, of
which lord Congresall accepted the office of captain. The French courtiers
readily embraced a fiction, which their sovereign thought it his interest
to adopt: Perkin, both by his deportment and person, supported the
prepos∣session, which was spread abroad of his royal pedigree: And
the whole kingdom was full of the accomplishments, as well as singular
adventures and misfortunes, of the young Plantagenet. Wonders of this nature
are commonly augmented at a distance. From France, the admiration and
credulity diffused themselves into Eng∣land: Sir George Neville, Sir John
Taylor, and a hundred gentlemen more came to Paris, in order to offer their
service to the supposed duke of York, and to share his fortunes: And
the impostor had now the appearance of a court at∣tending him, and began to
entertain hopes of final success in his undertakings.</P>
<P>WHEN peace was concluded between France and England at
Estaples, Henry applied to have Perkin put into his hands; but Charles,
resolute not to betray a young man, of whatever birth, whom he had invited
into his kingdom, would agree only to dismiss him. The pretended
Plantagenet retired to the dutchess of Burgundy in Flanders, and craving her
protection and assistance, offered to lay before her all the proofs of
that birth, to which he laid claim. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">He is
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>wed by the dutch∣ess of B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r∣gundy,</NOTE> The princess affected
ignorance of his pretensions; even put on the appearance of distrust; and
having, as she said, been already deceived by Simnel's claim, she was
determined never again to be seduced by any impostor. She desired before
all the world to be instructed in his reasons for assuming the name
which he bore; seemed to exa∣mine every circumstance with the most
scrupulous nicety; put many particular questions to him; affected
astonishment at his answers; and at last, after long and severe
scrutiny, burst out into joy and admiration at his wonderful delivery,
embraced him as her nephew, the true image of Edward, the sole heir of the
Plantagenets, and the legitimate successor of the English throne. She
imme∣diately <PB N="36" REF="42"/> <MILESTONE N="1493" UNIT="year"/>
assigned him an equipage, suited to his pretended birth; appointed him a
guard of thirty halberdiers; engaged every one to pay court to him; and on all
occasions honoured him with the appellation of the <HI>White Rose of
England.</HI> The Flemings, moved by the authority, which Margaret, both from
her rank and personal character, enjoyed among them, readily adopted the
fiction of Perkin's royal descent: No surmize of his true birth was as yet
heard of: Little contra∣diction was made to the prevailing opinion: And the
English, from their great communication with the natives of the Low
Countries, were every day more and more prepossessed in favour of the
impostor.</P>
<P>IT was not the populace alone of England, that gave credit to
Perkin's preten∣sions. Men of the highest birth and quality, disgusted
with Henry's government, by which they found the nobility depressed, began
to turn their eyes towards this new claimant, and some of them even entered
into a correspondence with him. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">and by many of the English nobility.</NOTE>
Lord Fitzwater, Sir Simon Mountfort, Sir Thomas Thwaites betrayed their
in∣clination towards him: Sir William Stanley himself, lord chamberlain, who
had been so active in raising Henry to the throne, moved either by blind
credulity or a restless ambition, entertained the project of a revolt in
favour of his enemy<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bacon, p. 608.</NOTE>. Sir Robert
Clifford and William Barley were still more open in their measures: They
went over to Flanders, offered their service to Perkin, and were introduced
by the dutchess of Burgundy to his acquaintance. Clifford wrote back to
Eng∣land, that he knew perfectly the person of Richard duke of York, that
this young man was undoubtedly that prince himself, and that no
circumstance of his story was exposed to the least difficulty. Such
positive intelligence, conveyed by a per∣son of such high rank and
character, was sufficient with many to put the matter beyond all question,
and excited the wonder and attention even of the most indif∣ferent. The whole
nation were held in suspense; a regular conspiracy was formed against
the King's authority; and a correspondence settled between the
malecon∣tents in Flanders and those in England.</P>
<P>THE King was well informed of all these particulars; but
agreeable to his cha∣racter, which was both cautious and resolute, he
proceeded very deliberately, but steadily, in counter-working the projects of
his enemies. His first object was to ascertain the death of the real duke
of York, and to confirm the opinion, which had always prevailed with regard to
that event. Four persons had been em∣ployed by Richard in the murder of his
nephews; Sir James Tirrel, to whom he had committed the government of the Tower
for that purpose, and who had seen the dead princes; Miles Forrest and
John Dighton, who perpetrated the action; and the priest who buried the
bodies. Tirrel and Dighton alone were alive, and they agreed in the same
story; but as the priest was dead, and as the bodies had 
<PB N="37" REF="43"/> been removed by Richard's orders from the place where they
were first interred, and could not now be found, it was not in Henry's power
to put the fact, so much as he wished, beyond all doubt and
controversy.</P>
<P>HE met at first with more difficulty, but was in the end more
successful, in detecting who this wonderful person was that thus boldly
advanced pretensions to his crown. He dispersed his spies all over
Flanders and England; he engaged many to pretend that they had embraced
Perkin's party; he directed them to in∣sinuate themselves into the
considence of his friends; in proportion as they con∣veyed intelligence of
any conspirator, he bribed his retainers, his domestic servants, nay
sometimes his confessor, and by these means traced up some other
confederate; Clifford himself he engaged by hopes of reward and pardon, to
betray the secrets committed to him; the more trust he gave any of his
spies, the higher resentment did he feign against them; some of them he
even caused to be excommunicated and publicly anathematized, in order the
better to procure them the confidence of his enemies: And in the issue, the
whole plan of the conspiracy was laid clearly before him; and the whole
pedigree, adventures, life and conversation of the pretended duke of York.
This latter story was im∣mediately published for the satisfaction of the
nation: The conspirators he reserved for a flower and more secure
vengeance.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1494" UNIT="year"/> MEANWHILE, he remonstrated
with the archduke Philip, on account of the countenance and protection, which
was afforded in his dominions to so infamous an imposture; contrary to
treaties subsisting between the sovereigns, and to the mutual amity,
which had so long been maintained by the subjects of both states.
Margaret had interest enough to get his applications rejected; under pretence
that Philip had no authority over the demesnes of the dutchess dowager. And
the King, in resentment of this injury, cut off all commerce with the Low
Countries, banished the Flemings from England, and recalled his own
subjects from these provinces. Philip retaliated by like edicts; but Henry
knew, that so mutinous a people as the Flemings would not long bear, in
compliance with the humours of their prince, to be deprived of so beneficial
a branch of commerce as that which they carried on with England.</P>
<P>HE had it in his power to inflict more effectual punishment on
his domestic enemies; and when his projects were sufficiently matured, he
failed not to make them feel the effects of his resentment. Almost in the
same instant, he arrested Fitzwater, Mountfort, and Thwaites, together
with William Daubeney, Robert Ratcliff, Thomas Cressenor, and Thomas
Astwood. All these were arraigned, convicted, and condemned for high
treason, in adhering and promising aid to Per∣kin. <PB N="38" REF="44"/>
Mountfort, Ratcliff, and Daubeney were immediately executed: Fitzwater was
sent over to Calais, and retained in custody; but having practised on his
keeper for an escape, he soon after underwent the same fate. The rest
were par∣doned, together with William Worseley, dean of St. Paul's, and
some others, who had been accused and examined, but not brought to public
trial<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Polydore Virgil, p. 592.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>GREATER and more solemn preparations were esteemed
requisite for the trial of Stanley, lord chamberlain, whose authority in
the nation, whose domes∣tic connexions with the King, as well as his former
great services, seemed to secure him against any accusation or
punishment. Clifford was directed to come over privately to England, and to
throw himself at the King's feet, while placed at the council table; craving
pardon for his past offences, and offering to attone for them by any
services, which should be required of him. Henry told him, that the best
proof he could give of penitence, and the only service he could now render
him, was the full confession of his guilt, and the discovery of all his
ac∣complices, however distinguished by rank or character. Encouraged by
this exhortation, Clifford accused Stanley then present, as his chief
abettor; and offered to lay before the council the whole proofs of his guilt.
Stanley himself could not discover more surprize than was affected by
Henry on this occasion. He received the intelligence as absolutely false
and incredible; that a man, to whom he was, in a great measure, beholden for
his crown, and even for his life; a man, to whom, by every honour and favour,
he had endeavoured to express his gratitude; whose brother, the earl of
Derby, was the King's father-in-law; to whom he had even committed the trust
of his person, by creating him lord cham∣berlain: That this man, enjoying his
full confidence and affection, not actuated by any motive of discontent or
apprehension, should engage in a conspiracy against him. Clifford was
therefore exhorted to weigh well the consequences of this accusation; but
as he persisted in the same positive asseverations, Stanley was
committed to custody, and soon after examined before the council<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Bacon, p. 611. Polyd. Virg. p. 593.</NOTE>. He denied
not the guilt imputed to him by Clifford; he did not even endeavour much to
extenuate it; whether he thought that a frank and open confession would
serve for an atonement, or trusted to his present connexions, and his
former services, for pardon and security. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Trial and ex∣ecution of Stanley.</NOTE> But
princes are often apt to regard great services as a ground of jealousy,
especially if accompanied with a craving and restless disposition, in
the person who has performed them. The general discontent also, and
mutinous humour of the people, seemed to require some great example of
severity. And as Stanley was one of the most opulent subjects in the
kingdom, being possessed <PB N="39" REF="45"/>
<MILESTONE N="1495" UNIT="year"/> of above three thousand pounds a year in
land, and forty thousand merks in plate and money, besides other property
of great value, the prospect of so rich a forfeiture was deemed no small
motive in Henry for proceeding to extremity against him. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">15th of Fe∣bruary.</NOTE> After six weeks
delay, which was interposed in order to shew that the King was restrained
by doubts and scruples; he was brought to his trial, condemned, and
presently after beheaded. Historians are not well agreed with regard to the
crime which was proved against him. The general report is, that he should
have said in confidence to Clifford, that, if he was sure the young man,
who appeared in Flanders, was really son to King Edward, he never would bear
arms against him. This sentiment might disgust Henry as implying a
preference of the house of York to that of Lancaster, but could scarcely
be the ground, even in those arbitrary times, of a sentence of high
treason against Stanley. It is more probable, therefore, what is
asserted by some historians, that he had expressly engaged to
assist Perkin, and had actually sent him some supply of money.</P>
<P>THE fate of Stanley made great impression on the whole
kingdom, and struck all Perkin's retainers with the deepest dismay. From
Clifford's desertion, they found that all their secrets were discovered;
and as it appeared, that Stanley, even while he seemed to live in the
greatest confidence with the King, had been continually surrounded by
spies, who reported and registered every action which he committed, nay,
every word which fell from him, a general distrust took place, and all
mutual confidence was destroyed, even among the most intimate friends and
acquaintance. The jealous and severe temper of the King, together with his
great reputation for sagacity and penetration, kept men in awe, and quelled
not only the movements of sedition, but the very murmurs of faction. Libels,
however, crept out against Henry's person and administration; and being
greedily propagated, by every secret art, showed that there still
remained among the people a considerable root of discontent, which wanted
only a proper opportunity to discover itself.</P>
<P>BUT Henry continued more intent on increasing the terrors of
his people, than on gaining their affections. Trusting to the great
success which attended him in all his enterprizes, he gave every day, more
and more, a loose to his ra∣pacious temper, and employed the arts of
perverted law and justice, in order to exact fines and compositions from
his people. Sir William Capel, alderman of London, was condemned on some
penal statutes to pay the sum of 2743 pounds, and was obliged to compound
for sixteen hundred and fifteen. This was the first noted case of that
nature; but it became a precedent, which prepared the <PB N="40" REF="46"/> way
for many others. The management, indeed, of these oppressive arts was the
great secret of the King's administration. While he depressed the
nobility, he exalted, and honoured and caressed the lawyers; and by that
means both bestowed authority on the laws, and was enabled, whenever he
pleased, to per∣vert them to his own advantage. His government was
oppressive; but it was so much the less burthensome, that, by
extending his own authority, and curbing the nobles, he became in reality the
sole oppressor in his kingdom.</P>
<P>AS Perkin found, that the King's authority gained ground daily
among the people, and that his own pretensions were becoming obsolete, he
resolved to attempt something, which might revive the hopes and
expectations of his partizans. Hav∣ing gathered together a band of outlaws,
pirates, robbers, and necessitous persons of all nations, to the number
of 600 men, he put to sea with a resolution of mak∣ing a descent in
England; and of exciting the common people to arms, since all his
correspondence with the nobility was cut off by Henry's vigilance and
se∣verity. Information being brought him, that the King had made a progress
to the north, he cast anchor on the coast of Kent, and sent some of his
retainers ashore, who invited the country to join him. The gentlemen of Kent
gathered together some troops to oppose him; but they proposed to do more
essential service than by repelling the invasion: They carried the
semblance of friendship to Perkin, and invited him to come himself
ashore, in order to take the command over them. But the wary youth,
observing that they had more order and regu∣larity in their movements than
could be supposed in new levied forces, who had taken arms against
established authority, refused to commit himself into their hands; and
the Kentish troops despairing of success in their stratagem, set
upon such of his retainers, as were already landed; and besides some who
were slain and some who escaped, they took an hundred and fifty
prisoners. These were tried and condemned; and all of them executed, by
order from the King, who was resolved to use no mixture of lenity towards
men of such desperate fortunes<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Polydore Virgil, p.
595.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A Parliament.</NOTE> THIS year a Parliament
was summoned in England, and another in Ireland; and some remarkable laws
were passed in both countries. The English Parlia∣ment enacted, that no
person who should assist in arms or otherwise the King for the time
being should ever afterwards, either by course of law or act of
Parlia∣ment, be attainted for such an instance of obedience. This statute
might be ex∣posed to some blame, as favourable to usurpers; were there
any precise rules, which always, even during the most factious times, could
determine the true suc∣cessor, and render every one inexcusable, who
did not submit to him. But as the titles of princes are then the great
subject of dispute, and each party pleads <PB N="41" REF="47"/> topics in
their own favour, it seems but equitable to secure those who act in
sup∣port of established tranquillity, an object at all times of undoubted
benefit and importance. Henry, conscious of his disputed title, promoted
this law in order to secure his partizans against all events; but as he had
himself observed a dif∣ferent practice with regard to Richard's adherents,
he had reason to apprehend, that, during the violence which usually
ensues on public convulsions, his example, rather than his law, would, in
case of a new revolution, be followed by his enemies. And the attempt to bind
the legislature itself, by prescribing rules to future Parliaments, was
plainly contradictory to the fundamental principles of political
government.</P>
<P>THIS Parliament also passed an act, impowering the King to
levy by course of law, all the sums which any person had agreed to pay by
way of benevolence: A statute, by which that arbitrary method of taxation was
directly authorized and justified.</P>
<P>THE King's authority appeared equally prevalent and
uncontrolable in Ireland. Sir Edward Poynings had been sent over with some
troops into that country, with an intention of quelling the partizans of the
house of York, and of reducing the natives to subjection. He was not
supported with forces sufficient for that important enterprize: The
Irish, by flying into their woods, and morasses, and mountains, in some
measure, eluded his efforts: But Poynings summoned a par∣liament at Dublin,
where he was more successful. He passed that memorable statute, which
still bears his name, and which establishes the authority of the
English government in Ireland. By this statute, the Parliament of England
were empowered to make laws for Ireland; and no bill can be introduced into the
Irish parliament, unless it previously receive the sanction of the
council of England.</P>
<P>WHILE Henry's authority was thus established throughout his
dominions, and general tranquillity prevailed, the whole continent was thrown
into combustion by the French invasion of Italy, and by the rapid
success which attended Charles in that rash and ill-concerted enterprize.
The Italians, who had entirely lost the use of arms, and who, in the
midst of continual wars, had become every day more unwarlike, were
astonished to meet with an enemy, that made the field of battle, not a
pompous tournament, but a scene of blood, and sought at the hazard of their
own lives the death of their enemy. Their e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>eminate troops were dissipated every where on the approach of
the French army: Their best fortified cities opened their gates: Kingdoms and
states were in an instant over∣turned: And thro' the whole length of Italy,
which the French penetrated with∣out <PB N="42" REF="48"/> resistance, they
seemed rather to be taking quarters in their own country, than making
conquests over an enemy. The maxims, which the Italians, during that age,
followed in negotiations, were as ill calculated to support their states,
as the habits to which they were addicted in war. A treacherous, deceitful, and
inconstant system of politics prevailed; and even those small remains
of fidelity and honour, which were preserved in the councils of the other
European princes, were ridiculed in Italy, as proofs of ignorance and
rusticity. Ludovico, duke of Milan, who invited the French to invade Naples,
had never desired nor ex∣pected their success; and was the first
alarmed at the prosperous issue of those projects, which he himself
had concerted. By his intrigues a league was formed among several potentates
to oppose the progress of Charles's conquests and secure their own
independency. This league was composed of Ludovico himself, the pope,
Maximilian King of the Romans, Ferdinand of Spain, and the republic of Venice.
Henry too entered into the confederacy; but was not put to any ex∣pence or
trouble in consequence of his engagements. The King of France, terrified by
so powerful a combination, retired from Naples with the greatest part of
his army, and returned to France. The forces, which he left in his new
conquests, partly by the revolt of the inhabitants, partly by the invasion
of the Spaniards, were soon after subdued; and the whole kingdom of Naples
suddenly returned to its allegiance under Ferdinand, son to Alphonso, who
had been suddenly expelled by the irruption of the French. Ferdinand died
soon after; and left his uncle, Frederic, in peaceable possession of
the throne.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>AFTER Perkin was repulsed from the coast of Kent, he retired
into Flan∣ders; but as he found it impossible to subsist himself
and his followers, while he remained in tranquillity, he soon after made an
attempt upon Ireland, which had always appeared forward to join every invader
of Henry's authority. But Poinings had now put the affairs of that island in
so good a posture, that Perkin met with little success; and being tired
of the savage life, which he was obliged to lead, while skulking among the
wild Irish, he bent his course towards Scotland, and presented himself
to James the fourth, who then governed that kingdom. He had been previously
recommended to that prince by the King of France, who was disgusted that
Henry had entered into the league against him; and this recommendation was
even seconded by Maximilian, who, tho' one of the confederates, stood on
ill terms with the King, on account of his prohibition of commerce with the Low
Countries. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Perkin

with the King of Scotland, who assured him, that, whatever he were, he
never should repent the putting him∣self into his hands<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bacon, p. 6. 5. Pol. Vi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g. p. 596, 5<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>7.</NOTE>:
The insinuating address and plausible behaviour of the youth himself
seem even to have gained him credit and authority. James, whom years had not
yet taught distrust and caution, was seduced to believe the story of
Perkin's birth and adventures; and he carried his confidence so far as to
give him in marriage the lady Catherine Gordon, daughter of the Farl of
Huntley, and a near kinswoman of his own; a young woman too, eminent for
virtue as well as beauty.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="50"/> <MILESTONE N="1496" UNIT="year"/> THERE
subsisted at that time a great jealousy between the courts of England
and Scotland; and James was probably the more forward on that account to adopt
any fiction, which, he thought, might reduce his enemy to distress or
difficulty. He suddenly resolved to make an inroad into England, attended
with some of the borderers; and he carried Perkin along with him, in hopes,
that the appearance of the pretended prince might raise an insurrection in
the northern counties. Perkin himself disperst a manifesto, where he
set forth his own story, and craved the assistance of all his
subjects in expelling the usurper, whose tyranny and
mal-administration, whose depression of the nobility by the elevation
of mean persons, whose oppression of the people by multiplied
impositions and vexations, had justly, he said, rendered him odious to
all men. But Perkin's pretensions, attended by repeated disappointments,
were now become stale in the eyes even of the populace; and the hostile
dispositions, which subsisted between the king∣doms, rendered a
prince, supported by the Scotch, but an unwelcome present to the English
nation. The ravages also, committed by the borderers, accustomed to licence
and disorder, struck a terror into all men; and made the people pre∣pare
rather for repelling the invaders than for joining them. Perkin, that he might
support his pretensions to royal birth, feigned great compassion for
the misery of his plundered subjects; and publickly remonstrated with his
ally against the de∣predations exercised by the Scotch army<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Polydore Virgil, p. 598.</NOTE>: But James told him, that he
doubted his concern was employed only in behalf of his enemy, and that he was
anxious to preserve what never would belong to him. That prince now began to
per∣ceive, that his attempt would be fruitless; and hearing of an army, which
was on its march to attack him, he thought proper to retreat into his own
country.</P>
<P>THE King discovered little anxiety to procure either
reparation or vengeance for this insult committed on him by the Scotch
nation: His chief concern was to draw advantage from it, by the pretence which
it would afford him to levy impositions on his own subjects. He summoned
a Parliament, to whom he made bitter complaints against the irruption of the
Scotch, the absurd imposture which was countenanced by that nation, the
cruel devastation which they had spread over the northern counties, and the
complicated affront which had thus been offered both to the King and kingdom of
England. The Parliament made the expected return to this discourse of the
King, by granting him a subsidy to the amount of 120,000 pounds, together
with two fifteenths. After making this grant, they were dismissed.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="51"/> <MILESTONE N="1497" UNIT="year"/> THE vote
of parliament for imposing the tax was easily procured by the au∣thority of
Henry; but he found it not so easy to levy the money upon his sub∣jects.
The people, who were acquainted with the immense treasures amassed by
the King, could ill brook the new impositions raised on every slight
occasion; and it is probable, that the flaw, which was universally known to
lie in his title, made his reign the more subject to insurrections and
rebellions. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Insurrection in the West.</NOTE> When the
sub∣sidy began to be levied in Cornwal, the inhabitants, numerous and poor,
robust and courageous, murmured against a tax, occasioned by a sudden
inroad of the Scotch, from which they esteemed themselves entirely
secure, and which had commonly been repelled by the force of the northern
counties. Their ill humour was farther incited by one Michael Joseph, a
farrier of Bodmin, a notable, talking fellow, who, by thrusting himself
forward on every occasion, and being loudest in every complaint against
the government, had acquired an authority among these rude people. Thomas
Flammoc too, a lawyer, who had become the ora∣cle of the neighbourhood,
encouraged the sedition, by informing them, that the tax, tho' imposed by
Parliament, was entirely illegal; that the northern nobility, by their tenures,
were obliged to defend the nation against the Scotch; and that if these new
impositions were tamely submitted to, the avarice of Henry and of his
courtiers would soon render the burthen intolerable upon the nation. A
petition, he said, must be delivered to the King, seconded by such
force as would give it authority; and in order to procure the concurrence of
the rest of the kingdom, care must be taken, by their orderly deportment,
to shew that they had nothing in view but the public good, and the redress
of all those grievances, under which the people had so long laboured.</P>
<P>ENCOURAGED by these speeches, the multitude flocked
together, and armed themselves with axes, bills, bows, and such weapons as
country people are usually possessed of. Flammoc and Joseph were
chosen their leaders. They soon conducted the Cornish through the county
of Devon, and reached that of Somerset. At Taunton the insurgents killed in
their fury an officious and eager commissioner for the subsidy, whom
they called the provost of Perin. When they reached Wells, they were joined
by lord Audley, a nobleman of an antient family, popular in his deportment, but
vain, ambitious, and restless in his temper. He had from the beginning
entertained a secret correspondence with the first movers of the
insurrection; and was now joyfully re∣ceived by them as their leader. Proud
of the countenance given them by so con∣siderable a nobleman, they pushed
on their march; breathing destruction to the King's ministers and
favourites, particularly Morton, now a cardinal, and Sir Reginald Bray, who
were deemed his most active instruments in all his oppressions.
Amidst their rage against the administration, they carefully followed the
di∣rections <PB N="46" REF="52"/> given them by their leaders; and as they met
with no resistance, they committed, during their march, no violence or
disorder.</P>
<P>THE insurgents had been told by Flammoc, that the inhabitants
of Kent, as they had ever, during all ages, remained unsubdued, and had even
maintained their independancy during the Norman conquest, would surely
embrace their party, and declare themselves for a cause, which was no other
than that of public good and general liberty. But the Kentish people had very
lately distinguished themselves by repelling Perkin's invasion; and
having received from the King many gracious acknowledgments for this service,
their affections were, by that means, much conciliated to his government. It
was easy therefore, for the earl of Kent, lord Abergavenny, and lord Cobham,
who possessed great authority in those parts, to retain the people in
obedience; and the Cornish rebels, though they pitched their camp near
Eltham, at the very gates of London, and invited all the people to join them,
got reinforcement from no quarter. There wanted not discontent every where,
but no one would take part in so rash and ill-concerted an enterprize; and
the situation in which the King's affairs then stood, discou∣raged even
the boldest and most daring.</P>
<P>HENRY, in order to oppose the Scotch, had already levied an
army, which he put under the command of lord Daubeney, the chamberlain; and
so soon as he heard of the Cornish insurrection, he ordered it to march
southwards, and sup∣press the rebels. Not to leave the northern frontier
defenceless, he dispatched thither the earl of Surry, who summoned out
the forces on the borders, and made head against the enemy. Henry found here
the concurrence of the three most fatal incidents, which can befal a
monarchy; a foreign enemy, a domestic rebellion, and a pretender to his
throne; but he enjoyed great resources in his army and treasure, and
still more, in the intrepidity and courage of his own temper. He gave not,
however, immediately full scope to his military spirit. On other
occasions, he had always hastened to a decision, and it was an usual
saying with him, <HI>that he desired but to see his rebels:</HI> But as
the Cornish insurgents behaved in an inoffensive manner, and committed no
spoil on the country, as they received no accession of force on their
march or in their encampment, and as such hasty and popular tumults might
be expected to diminish every moment by delay, he took post in London, and
carefully prepared the means of ensuring the victory.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Battle of Blackheath.</NOTE> AFTER all his
forces were collected, he divided them into three bodies, and marched out to
assail the enemy. The first body, commanded by the earl of Oxford, and
under him by the earls of Essex and Suffolk, were appointed to place
themselves behind the hill on which the rebels were encamped: The second 
<PB N="47" REF="53"/> and most considerable Henry put under the command of
lord Daubeney, and or∣dered him to attack the enemy in front, and bring on the
action. The third, he kept as a body of reserve about his own person, and
took post in St. George's field; where he secured the city, and could
easily, as occasion served, either restore the fight or finish the
victory. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">22d of June.</NOTE> To put the enemy off their
guard, he had spread a report that he was not to attack them till some days
after; and the better to confirm them in this opinion, he began not the action
till near the evening. Dau∣beney beat a detachment of the rebels from
Deptford-bridge; and before the main body could be in order to receive him, he
had gained the ascent of the hill, and placed himself in array before them.
They were very formidable for their numbers, being sixteen thousand
strong, and were not defective in valour; but being tumultuary troops, ill
armed, and unprovided of cavalry or artillery, they were but an une∣qual match
for the King's forces. Daubeney began the attack with courage, and even with a
contempt of the enemy, which had almost proved fatal to him. He rushed into
the midst of them, and was taken prisoner; but soon after was re∣lieved
by his own troops. After some resistance, the rebels were broke, and put
to flight<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Polydore Virgil, p. 601.</NOTE>. Lord Audley,
Flammoc, and Joseph, their leaders, were taken, and all three executed. The
latter seemed even to exult in his end, and boasted, with a preposterous
ambition, that he would make a figure in history. The rebels, being
surrounded on every side by the King's troops, were almost all made
prisoners; and immediately dismissed without farther punishment.
Whe∣ther, that Henry was satisfied with the victims who had fallen in the
field, and who amounted to near two thousand, or that he pitied the ignorance
and simplicity of the multitude, or favoured them on account of their
inoffensive behaviour, or was pleased that they had never, during their
insurrection, disputed his title, and had shewn no attachment to the
house of York, the most capital crime of which in his eyes they could have
been guilty.</P>
<P>THE Scottish King was not idle during these commotions in
England. He levied a considerable army, and sat down before the castle of
Norham in North∣umberland; but found that place, by the precaution of Fox,
bishop of Durham, so well provided both in men and ammunition, that he made
little or no progress in the siege. Hearing that Surrey had collected
some forces and was advancing upon him, he retreated backwards into his own
country, and left the frontiers exposed to the inroads of the English
general, who besieged and took Aiton, a small castle that lies a few
miles beyond Berwic. These unsuccessful or frivolous attempts on both
sides prognosticated a speedy end to the war; and Henry,
not∣withstanding his superior force, was no less desirous than James of
terminating the <PB N="48" REF="54"/> differences between the nations. Not to
depart, however, from his dignity, by making the first advances towards
peace, he employed in this friendly office Peter Hialas, a man of address and
learning, who had come to him as ambassador from Ferdinand and Isabella,
and who was charged with a commission of nego∣tiating the marriage of the
infanta Catherine, their daughter, with Arthur prince of Wales<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Polydore Virgil, p. 603.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>HIALAS took a journey northwards, and offered his mediation
between James and Henry, as minister of a prince, who was in alliance with
both potentates. Commissioners were soon appointed to meet, and confer of
the terms of accom∣modation. The first demand of the English was, that
Perkin should be put into their hands; but James replied, that he himself
was no judge of Perkin's pre∣tensions, but having received him as a
supplicant, and promised him protection, he was determined not to betray a
man, whatever he was, who had trusted to his good faith and his generosity.
The next demand of the English met with no bet∣ter reception: They required
reparation for the ravages committed by the late inroads into England: The
Scotch commissioners replied, that the spoils were like water spilt
upon the ground, which never could be recovered, and that Henry's subjects
were better able to bear the loss than their master's to repair it. Henry's
commissioners next proposed, that the two Kings should have an
inter∣view at Newcastle, in order to adjust all differences; but James
said, that he meant to treat of a peace, not to go a begging for it. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Truce with Scotland.</NOTE> Lest the
conferences should break off altogether without effect, a truce was concluded
for some months; and James perceiving, that while Perkin remained in
Scotland, he never would enjoy a solid peace with Henry, privately desired
him to depart the Kingdom.</P>
<P>ACCESS was now barred Perkin into the low countries; his usual
retreat in all his disappointments. The Flemish merchants, who felt
severely the loss result∣ing from their want of commerce with England,
had made such interest in the arch-duke's council, that commissioners
were sent to London, in order to treat of an accommodation. The Flemish
court agreed that all English rebels should be excluded the low countries;
and in this prohibition the demesnes of the dutchess dowager were
expressly comprehended. When this principal article was agreed to, all the
other terms were easily adjusted. A treaty of com∣merce was finished,
which was favourable to the Flemings, and to which they gave long the
appellation of <HI>Intercursus magnus,</HI> the great treaty. And when the
Engli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h merchants returned to their
usual mansion at Antwerp, they were pub∣licly received, as in
procession, with great joy and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>estivity.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="55"/> PERKIN was a Fleming by descent, tho'
born in England; and it might there∣fore be doubted, whether he was
comprehended in the treaty between the two nations: But as he must
dismiss all his English retainers if he took shelter in the low
countries, and as he was sure of a cold reception, if not bad usage, among
a people who were determined to keep on terms of friendship with the court of
England; he thought fit rather to hide himself, during some time, in the
wilds and fastnesses of Ireland. Impatient however of a retreat, which
was both disagreeable and dangerous, he held consultations with his
followers, Herne, Skelton, and Astley, three broken tradesmen; and by their
advice, resolved to try the affec∣tions of the Cornish, whose mutinous
disposition, notwithstanding the King's lenity, still subsisted,
after the suppression of their rebellion. No sooner did he appear at
Bodmin in Cornwal, than the populace, to the number of three thou∣sand men,
flocked to his standard; and Perkin, elated with this appearance of
success, took on him, for the first time, the appellation of Richard the
fourth, King of England. Not to suffer the expectations of his followers to
languish, he presented himself before Exeter; and by many fair
promises, invited that city to join his cause. Finding that the inhabitants
shut their gates against him, he laid siege to the place; but being
unprovided of artillery, ammunition, and of every thing requisite for that
attempt, he made no progress in his undertaking. Mes∣sengers were sent
to the King, informing him of this insurrection; and the citizens meanwhile
were determined to hold out to the last extremity, in expectation of
receiving succour from the known vigilance of that monarch.</P>
<P>WHEN Henry was informed, that Perkin was landed in England, he
expressed great joy, and prepared himself with alacrity to attack him, in
hopes of being able, at last, to put a period to a pretension, which had
so long given him vex∣ation and inquietude. All the courtiers, sensible
that their activity on this occa∣sion would be the most acceptable
service which they could render the King, prepared themselves for the
enterprize, and forwarded his preparations. The lords Daubeney, and Broke, with
Sir Rice ap Thomas, hastened forward with a small body of troops to the
relief of Exeter. The earl of Devonshire, and the most considerable
gentlemen in the country of that name, took arms of them∣selves, and marched
to join the King's generals. The duke of Buckingham put himself at the head
of a troop of young nobility and gentry, who served as vo∣luntiers, and who
longed for an opportunity of displaying their courage and their loyalty. The
King himself prepared to follow with a considerable army; and thus all
England seemed united against a pretender, who had at first engaged their
attention, and divided their affections.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="56"/> PERKIN, informed of these great
preparations▪ immediately broke up the siege of Exeter, and retired to
Taunton. Tho' his followers now amounted to the number of near seven
thousand men, and seemed still resolute to defend his cause, he
himself despaired of success, and secretly withdrew to the
sanctuary of Beuley in the new forest. The Cornish rebels submitted
themselves to the King's mercy, and found that it was not yet exhausted in
their behalf. Except a few persons of desperate fortunes, who were
executed, and some others who were severely fined, all the rest were
dismist with impunity. The Lady Catherine Gordon, wife to Perkin, fell into
the conqueror's hands, and was treated with a generosity, which does him
honour. He soothed her mind with many tokens of regard, placed her in a
reputable station about the queen, and assigned her a pension, which
she enjoyed even under his successor.</P>
<P>HENRY next deliberated what course to take with Perkin
himself. Some coun∣selled him to make the privileges of the church yield to
reasons of state, to take him by violence from the sanctuary, to inflict
on him the punishment due to his temerity, and thus at once to put an end to
an imposture which had long disturbed the government, and which the
credulity of the people and the artifices of male-contents were still capable
of reviving. But the King deemed not the matter of such importance as to
merit so violent a remedy. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Perkin taken prisoner.</NOTE> He employed
some persons to deal with Perkin, and perswade him, under promise of
pardon, to deliver himself into the King's hands<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Polydore Virgil, p. 606.</NOTE>. The King conducted him in a
species of mock triumph to London. As Perkin passed along the road, and
through the streets of that city, men of all ranks flocked about him, and the
populace treated with the highest derision his fallen fortunes. They
seemed desirous of revenging them∣selves by their insults for the
shame which their former belief of his impostures had thrown upon them.
<MILESTONE N="1498" UNIT="year"/> Tho' the eyes of the nation were generally
opened with re∣gard to Perkin's real parentage and station, Henry thought
proper to require of him a confession of his life and adventures; and he
ordered the account of the whole to be published soon after for the
satisfaction of the public. But as his re∣gard to decency made him
suppress entirely the share which the dutchess of Bur∣gundy had had in
contriving and conducting the imposture, the people, who knew that she had
been the chief instrument in the whole affair, were inclined, on account of
the silence on that head, to pay less credit to the authenticity of the
narrative.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1499" UNIT="year"/> BUT Perkin, tho' his life was
granted him, was still retained in custody; and keepers were appointed to
guard him. Impatient of confinement, he broke loose from his keepers, and
flying to the sanctuary of Shyne, put himself into the hands 
<PB N="51" REF="57"/> of the prior of that monastery. The prior had obtained
great credit by his cha∣racter of sanctity; and he prevailed with the King
again to grant a pardon to Per∣kin. But in order to reduce him to still
greater contempt, he was set in the stocks Westminster and at
Cheapside, and obliged in both places to read aloud to the people the
confession which had been formerly published in his name. He was thrown
into the Tower, where his habits of restless intrigue and enterprize
still followed him. He insinuated himself into the intimacy of four
servants of Sir John Digby, lieutenant of the Tower; and by their means,
opened a correspon∣dence with the earl of Warwic, who was confined to the
same prison. That un∣fortunate prince, who had from his earliest infancy
been shut up from the com∣merce of men, and who was ignorant even of the
most common affairs of life, had fallen into a simplicity which made him
susceptible of any impressions. The continued dread also of the more
violent effects of Henry's tyranny, joined to the natural love of liberty,
engaged him to embrace a project for his escape, by the murder of the
lieutenant; and Perkin offered to conduct the whole enterprize. The
conspiracy escaped not the King's vigilance: It was even very generally
be∣lieved, that the scheme was laid by himself, in order to draw Perkin and
Warwic into the snare: But the subsequent execution of two of Digby's
servants for the contrivance seems to clear the King of that imputation,
which was indeed founded more on the general idea entertained of his character,
than on any positive evidence.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Perkin exe∣cuted.</NOTE> PERKIN, by this new
attempt, after so many enormities, had rendered himself totally unworthy of
mercy; and he was accordingly arraigned, condemned, and soon after hanged at
Tyburn, persisting still in the confession of his imposture<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Stow, Baker, Speed, Biondi, Holingshed, Bacon▪ Some
late writers have been so whimsical as to doubt, whether Perkin was an
impostor, and even to assert him to be the real Richard Plantagenet, duke
of York. But to refute this fancy, we need but reflect on the few following
particulars. 1. Had not the queen mother, and the other heads of the York
party, been fully assured of the death of both the young princes, would
they have agreed to call over the earl of Richmond, the head of the
Lancastrian party, and marry him to the princess Flizabeth? 2. The story
told constantly by Perkin of his escape is ut∣terly incredible, that
those who were sent to murder his brother took pity on him, and granted him
his liberty. 3. What became of him during the course of seven years, from
his supposed death till his appearance in Ireland in 1491? Why was not the
queen mother, the dutchess of Burgundy, and the other friends of the family
applied to, during that time, for his support and education? 4. Tho' the
dutchess of Burgundy at last acknowledged him for her nephew, she had
lost all pretence to authority by her former acknowledgment and support of
Lambert Simnel, an avowed impostor. It is remarkable, that Mr. Carte, in
order to preserve the weight of the dutchess's testimony, in favour of
Perkin, sup∣presses entirely this material fact. A remarkable effect of
party prejudices, and the author's desire of blackening Henry the seventh,
whose hereditary title to the crown was defective. 5. Perkin himself
con∣fessed his imposture more than once, and read his confession
before the whole people. It is pretended that this confession was drawn
from him by torture; but no antient historian gives any ground for this
surmise. 6. He renewed his confession at the foot of the gibbet on
which he was executed. 7. After Henry the eighth's accession, the titles of
the house of York and Lancaster were fully confounded, and there was no
longer any necessity for defending Henry the seventh and his title; yet
all the historians of that time, when the events were recent, some of
these historians too, such as Sir Thomas More, of the highest
authority, agree in treating Perkin as an impostor.</NOTE>. 
<PB N="52" REF="58"/> It happened about that very time, that one Wilford, a
cordwainer's son▪ encou∣raged by the surprizing credit which had been
given to other impostures, had undertaken to personate the earl of Warwic;
and a priest had even ventured from the pulpit to recommend his cause to
the people, who seemed still to retain a propensity to adopt it. This
incident served Henry as an apology for his severity towards that
unfortunate prince. He was brought to trial, and accused, not of contriving
his escape, (for as he was committed for no crime, the desire of liberty
must have been regarded as natural and innocent) but of forming designs to
disturb the government, and raise an insurrection among the people. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The earl of Warwic exe∣cuted.</NOTE> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">21st of No∣vember.</NOTE> Warwic
confessed the indictment, was condemned, and the sentence was executed
upon him.</P>
<P>THIS violent tyranny, the great stain of Henry's reign, by
which he destroyed the last remaining male of the line of Plantagenet,
begot great discontent among the people, who saw an unhappy prince, that
had long been deprived of all the privileges of his high birth, even cut off
from the common benefits of nature, now at last deprived of life itself,
merely for resisting that oppression under which he laboured. In vain
did Henry endeavour to alleviate the odium of this guilt, by sharing it with
his ally, Ferdinand of Arragon, who, he said, had scrupled to give his
daughter Catherine in marriage to Arthur, while any prince of the house of
York remained alive. Men, on the contrary, felt higher indignation at seeing
a young prince sacrificed, not to law and justice, but to the jealous
politics of two subtle and crafty tyrants.</P>
<P>BUT tho' these discontents festered in the minds of men,
they were so checked by Henry's watchful policy and steady severity, that
they appeared not to weaken his government; and foreign princes, deeming his
throne now entirely secure, payed him rather the greater courtship and
attention. The arch-duke Philip, in particular, desired an interview with the
King; and this monarch, who had passed over to Calais, agreed to meet him
at St. Peter's church near that city. The arch-duke, on his approaching the
King, made haste to alight, and offered to hold Henry's stirrup; a mark of
condescension, which that prince would not admit of. He called the King
<HI>father, patron, protector;</HI> and by his whole be∣haviour expressed a
strong desire of conciliating the friendship of England. The 
<PB N="53" REF="59"/> duke of Orleans had succeeded to the kingdom of France
under the appellation of Lewis the twelfth; and having carried his arms into
Italy, and subdued the dutchy of Milan, his progress begot jealousy in
Maximilian, Philip's father, as well as in Ferdinand, his father-in-law. By the
council, therefore, of these monarchs, the young prince endeavoured by every
art to acquire the amity of Henry, whom they regarded as the chief counterpoize
to the greatness of France. No particu∣lar plan however of alliance seems
to have been concerted between these two prin∣ces in their interview: All
passed in general professions of affection and regard; at least, in
remote projects of a closer union, by the future intermarriages of their
children, who were then in a state of infancy.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1500" UNIT="year"/> THE pope too, Alexander the
sixth, neglected not the friendship of a monarch, whose reputation was
spread all over Europe. He sent a nuntio to England, who exhorted the King
to take part in the great alliance projected for the recovery of the Holy Land,
and to lead in person his forces against the Turk. The gene∣ral frenzy for
croisadoes was now entirely exhausted in Europe; but it was still thought
a necessary piece of decency to pretend zeal for those pious enterprizes.
Henry regreted the distance of his situation, which rendered it
inconvenient for him to expose his person in defence of the christian
cause. He promised, how∣ever, his utmost assistance by aids and
contributions; and rather than the pope should go alone to the holy wars,
unaccompanied by any monarch, he even pro∣mised to overlook all other
considerations, and to attend him in person. He only required as a
necessary condition, that all differences should be previously
composed among christian princes, and that some sea-port towns in Italy
should be put into his hands for his retreat and security. It was easy to
conclude from this answer, that Henry had determined with himself not to
intermeddle in any wars against the Turk: But as a great name, without any
real assistance, is sometimes of service, the knights of Rhodes, who
were at that time esteemed the bulwark of Christendom, chose the King
protector of their order.</P>
<P>BUT the prince, whose alliance Henry valued the most, was
that of Ferdinand of Arragon, whose vigorous and steddy policy, always
attended with success, had rendered him, in many respects, the most
considerable monarch in Europe. There was also a remarkable similarity of
character between these two princes: Both were full of craft, intrigue, and
design; and tho' a resemblance of this na∣ture be a slender foundation of
confidence and friendship, where the interests of the parties in the
least interfere; yet such was the situation of Henry and Ferdi∣nand, that
no jealousy ever on any occasion arose between them.

<NOTE PLACE="marg">Marriage of prince Arthur with Catherine of
Arragon.</NOTE> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">12th of No∣vember.</NOTE> The King had now the
satisfaction of compleating a marriage, which had been projected and
negotiated during the course of seven years, between Arthur prince of Wales
and <PB N="54" REF="60"/> <MILESTONE N="1502" UNIT="year"/> the infanta
Catherine, fourth daughter of Ferdinand and Isabella; he near sixteen years
of age, she eighteen. But this marriage proved in the issue
unprosperous. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">2d of April.</NOTE> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">His death.</NOTE> The young prince, a few
months after, sickened and died, very much regreted by the whole nation.
Henry, desirous to continue his alliance with Spain, and also unwilling to
restore Catherine's dowry, which was two hundred thousand ducats, obliged
his second son, Henry, whom he created prince of Wales, to be contracted to
the princess. The prince made all the opposition which a youth of twelve
years of age was capable of; but as the King persisted in his resolution,
the espousals were at last, by means of the pope's dispensation,
concluded between the parties: An event, which was afterwards attended with the
most important consequences.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Marriage of the princess Margaret with the
King of Scotland.</NOTE> THE same year, another marriage was concluded, which
was also, in the next age, productive of great events: The marriage of
Margaret, the King's eldest daughter, with James King of Scotland. This
alliance had been negotiated during three years, tho' interrupted by several
broils; and Henry hoped, from the completion of it, to remove all source of
discord with that neighbouring king∣dom, by whose animosity England had
been so often infested. When this marriage was deliberated on in the
English council, some objected, that England might, by means of that
alliance, fall under the dominion of Scotland. 
<Q REND="inline">"No;" replied Henry, "Scotland, in that event,
would only become an accession to England."</Q>
<MILESTONE N="1503" UNIT="year"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">11th of Fe∣bruary.</NOTE> Amidst these
prosperous events, the King met with a domestic calamity, which made not
such impression on him as it merited. His queen died in child-bed; and
the infant lived not long after. This princess was deservedly a great
favourite of the nation; and the general affection for her encreased, on
account of the harsh treatment, which, it was thought, she met with from
her consort.</P>
<P>THE situation of the King's affairs, both at home and abroad,
was now, in every respect, very desirable. All the efforts of the European
princes, both in war and negotiation, were turned to the side of Italy; and
the various events, which there arose, made Henry's alliance be courted by
every party, and yet interested him so little as never to touch him with
concern or anxiety. His close connexions with Spain and Scotland ensured
his tranquillity; and his continued successes over domestic enemies,
owing to the prudence and vigour of his conduct, had reduced the people to
entire submission and obedience. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Oppressions of the people.</NOTE> Henry
therefore, uncontrouled by apprehension or opposition of any kind, gave
full scope to his natural propensity; and avarice, which had ever been his
predominant passion, being encr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ased by age, and encouraged by absolute authority, broke all
restraints of shame or justice. He had found two ministers, Empson
and Dudley, perfectly qualified to second his rapacious and tyrannical
inclinations, and prey <PB N="55" REF="61"/> upon his defenceless people.
These Instruments of oppression were both lawyers, the first of mean
birth, of brutal manners, of an unrelenting temper; the se∣cond better born,
better educated, and better bred, but equally unjust, severe, and
inflexible. By their knowledge in the law, these men were qualified to
per∣vert the forms of justice to the oppression of the innocent; and the
formidable authority of the King supported them in all their iniquities.</P>
<P>IT was their usual practice to observe so far the
appearance of law as to give indictments to those whom they intended to
oppress: Upon which the persons were committed to prison, but never
brought to trial; and were at last obliged to recover their liberty, by
paying heavy fines and ransoms, which were called mitigations and
compositions. By degrees, the very appearance of law was ne∣glected: They
sent forth their precepts to attach men, and summon them before
themselves and some others, at their private houses, in a court of
commission; where, in a summary manner, without trial or jury, arbitrary
decrees were issued, both in pleas of the crown and controversies between
private parties. Juries themselves, when summoned, proved but small
security to the subject; being brow-beat by these oppressors; nay,
fined, imprisoned, and punished, if they gave sentence against the
inclination of the ministers. The whole system of the feudal law, which
then prevailed, was turned into a scheme of oppression. Even the King's
wards, after they came to full age, were not suffered to enter in
possession of their lands without paying exorbitant fines. Men were
also harassed with informations of intrusion upon scarce colourable
titles. When an outlawry in a personal action was issued against any
man, he was not allowed to purchase his charter of pardon, except on the
payment of a great sum; and if he refused the composition required of
him, the strict law, which, in such cases, allows for∣feiture of goods,
was rigorously insisted on. Nay, without any colour of law, the half of
men's lands and rents were seized during two years, as a penalty in case of
outlawry. But the chief instrument of oppression, employed by these
ministers, were the penal Statutes, which, without consideration of rank,
quality, or services, were strictly put in execution against all men:
Spies, informers, and inquisitors were rewarded and encouraged in every
corner of the kingdom: And no difference was made whether the statute was
beneficial or hurtful, recent or obsolete, possible or impossible to
be executed. The sole end of the King and his ministers was to amass
money, and bring every one under the lash of their authority<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bacon, 629, 30. Hollingshed, p. 504. Polyd. Virg. p. 613,
615.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="62"/> BY the prevalence of such an arbitrary
and iniquitous administration, the Eng∣lish, it may safely be affirmed,
were considerable losers by the ancient privilege, which secured them
from all taxations and impositions, except such as were levied by their own
consent. Had the King been empowered to lay on general taxes at his
pleasure, he would naturally have abstained from these oppressive
expedients, which destroyed all security in private property, and begot an
universal diffi∣dence thro' the nation. In vain did the people look for
protection from the Parliament, which was pretty frequently summoned during
this reign. <MILESTONE N="1504" UNIT="year"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">25th January.</NOTE> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Parliament.</NOTE> That assembly was
so overawed, that, at this very time, during the greatest rage of Henry's
oppression, the commons chose Dudley their speaker, the very man who
was the chief instrument of his oppressions. And tho' the King was known
to be immensely opulent, and had no pretence of wars or expensive
enterprizes of any kind, they granted him the subsidy, which he demanded.
<MILESTONE N="1505" UNIT="year"/> But so insatiable was his avarice, that
the next year he levied a new benevolence, and renewed that arbitrary and
oppressive method of taxation. By all these arts of accumu∣lation, joined
to a rigid frugality in his expence, he so filled his coffers, that he is
said to have possessed in ready money the sum of 1,800,000 pounds:
An in∣credible treasure, if we consider the scarcity of money in those
days<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Silver was during this reign at 37 shillings and
six pence a pound, which makes Henry's treasure above 2,750▪000 pounds
sterling. Besides▪ many commodities became twice as dear by the
encrease of gold and silver in Europe. And what is a circumstance of
still greater weight, all other states were then very poor, in comparison
of what they are at present: These circumstances make Henry's treasure
appear very great; and may lead us to conceive the oppressions of his
government.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT while Henry was enriching himself with the spoils of his
oppressed people, there happened an event abroad, which engaged his
attention, and was even the object of his anxiety and concern. Isabella,
queen of Castile, d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed about this
time; and it was foreseen, that by this incident the fortunes of Ferdi∣dand,
her husband, would be much affected. The King was not only attentive to the
sate of his ally, and watchful lest the general system of Europe
should be affected by so important an event: He also considered the
similarity of his own situation with that of Ferdinand, and regarded the
issue of these transactions as a precedent for himself. Joan, the
daughter of Ferdinand by Isabella, was married to the archduke Philip, and
being, in right of her mother, heiress of Castile, seemed entitled to
dispute with Ferdinand the present administration of that kingdom. Henry
knew, that, notwithstanding his own pretensions by the house of
Lancaster, the greatest part of the nation were convinced of the
supe∣riority of his wife's title; and he dreaded lest the prince, who was
daily advanc∣ing towards manhood, might be tempted by ambi ion to lay immediate
claim to <PB N="57" REF="63"/> the throne. By his perpetual attention to
depress the partizans of the York family, he had more closely united them
into one party, and encreased their desire of shaking off that yoke,
under which they had so long laboured, and of taking every advantage, which
his oppressive government would give his enemies against him. And as he
possessed no independent force like Ferdinand, and go∣verned a kingdom
more turbulent and unruly, which he himself, by his narrow politics, had
confirmed in factious prejudices; he apprehended that his situation would
prove in the issue still more precarious.</P>
<P>NOTHING could turn out more contrary to the King's inclination
than the transactions in Spain. Ferdinand had become very unpopular in
Castile, chiefly by reason of his former exactions and impositions; and
the states of the kingdom dis∣covered an evident resolution of preferring
the title of Philip and Joan. <MILESTONE N="1506" UNIT="year"/> In order to
take advantage of these favourable dispositions, the archduke, now King
of Castile, attended with his consort, embarked for Spain during the winter
season; and meeting with a violent tempest in the channel, was obliged to
take shelter in the harbour of Weymouth. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A rival of the King of Cas∣tile.</NOTE> Sir
John Trenchard, a gentleman of authority in the county of Dorset, hearing of
a fleet upon the coast, had assembled some forces; and being joined by
Sir John Cary, who was also at the head of an armed body, he came to that
town. Finding, that Philip, in order to relieve his sickness and fatigue,
was already come ashore, he invited him to his house; and immediately
dispatched an express to inform the court of this important incident. The
King sent in all haste the earl of Arundel to congratulate the archduke on
his arrival in England, and to inform him, that he intended to pay him a
visit in person, and give him a suitable reception in his kingdom. Philip
knew, that he could not now depart without the King's consent; and therefore,
for the sake of dispatch, he resolved to anticipate his visit, and to
have an interview with him at Windsor. Henry received him with all the
magnificence possible, and with all the seeming cordiality; but he
resolved, notwithstanding, to extract some advantage from this
involuntary visit, payed him by his royal guest.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Intrigues of the Earl of Suffolk.</NOTE>
EDMOND de la Pole, earl of Suffolk, nephew to Edward the fourth, and bro∣ther
to the earl of Lincoln, slain at the battle of Stoke, had some years before
killed for a man in a sudden fit of passion, and had been obliged to
apply to the King for a remission of his crime. The King had granted his
request; but being little indulgent to all persons connected with the
house of York, he obliged him to appear openly in court and plead his pardon.
Suffolk more resenting the affront, than grateful for the favour, had fled
into Flanders, and taken shelter with his aunt, the dutchess of Burgundy:
But being promised forgiveness by the King, he returned into England, and
obtained a new pardon. Actuated, however, by the <PB N="58" REF="64"/> natural
inquietude of his temper, and uneasy from debts which he had contracted by
his expences at prince Arthur's marriage, he again made an elopement into
Flanders. The King, well acquainted with the general discontent which
pre∣vailed against his administration, neglected not this incident, which
might be∣come of importance; and he employed his usual artifices to elude the
efforts of his enemies. He directed Sir Robert Curson, governor of the
castle of Hammes, to fly from his charge, and to insinuate himself into
the confidence of Suffolk, by making him a tender of his services. Upon
information secretly conveyed by Curson, the King seized William
Courtney, earl of Devonshire, his brother in law, married to the lady
Catherine, daughter of Edward the fourth; Wil∣liam de la Pole, brother to the
earl of Suffolk; Sir James Tirrel, and Sir James Windham, with some persons
of inferior quality; and he committed them all to custody. The lord
Abergavenny and Sir Thomas Green were also appre∣hended; but were soon
after freed from their confinement. William de la Pole was retained in prison
during a long time: And the earl of Devonshire recovered not his freedom
during the King's life. But Henry's chief severity fell upon Sir James
Windham, and Sir James Tirrel, who were both brought to their trial, condemned,
and executed: The fate of the latter gave universal satis∣faction, on
account of his participation in the murther of the young princes, sons to
Edward the fourth. Notwithstanding these discoveries and executions,
Curson was still able to maintain his credit with the earl of Suffolk; and
Henry, in order to remove all suspicions, had ordered him to be
excommunicated, to∣gether with Suffolk himself, for his pretended rebellion.
But after that traitor had performed all the services expected from him, he
suddenly deserted the earl, and came over to England, where the King
received him with unusual marks of favour and confidence. Suffolk,
astonished at this instance of perfidy, finding even that the dutchess
of Burgundy, tired with so many fruitless attempts, had become indifferent
to his cause, fled secretly into France, thence into Germany, and returned
at last into the Low Countries; where he was protected, tho' not
countenanced, by the archduke Philip, then in close alliance with the
king.</P>
<P>HENRY neglected not the present opportunity of compliaining to
Philip of the reception, which Suffolk had met with in his dominions. 
<Q REND="inline">"I really thought," replied the King of
Castile, "that your greatness and felicity had set you far above
apprehensions from any person of so little consequence: But to give you
satisfaction, I shall banish him my state."</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">"I expect, that you will carry your
complaisance farther," said the King: "I desire to have Suffolk put into
my hands, where alone I can depend upon his submission and
obedience."</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">"That measure," said Phillip, "will reflect
dishonour upon you as well as <PB N="59" REF="65"/> myself. You will be
thought to have used me as a prisoner."</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">"Then the matter is at an end," replied the
King, "for I will take that dishonour upon me; and so your honour is
saved<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bacon, p. 633.</NOTE>."</Q> The king of
Castile found himself under a necessity of complying; but he first
exacted Henry's promise that he would spare Suffolk's life. That nobleman
was invited over to England by Philip; as if the King would grant him a pardon,
by the intercession of his friend and ally. Upon his appearance, he was
committed to the Tower; and the King of Castile, having fully satisfied
Henry, as well by this concession, as by signing a treaty of commerce
between England and Castile, which was advantageous to the former
kingdom<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. 13. p. 14<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE>, was at last allowed to
depart, after a stay of three months. <MILESTONE N="1507" UNIT="year"/> He
landed in Spain, was joyfully received by the Casti∣lians, and put in
possession of the throne. He died soon after; and Joan, his widow,
falling into deep melancholy, Ferdinand was again enabled to re-instate
himself in his authority, and to govern, till the day of his death, the whole
Spanish monarchy.</P>
<P>THE King survived these transactions two years; but little
memorable occurs in the remaining part of his reign, except his affiancing his
second daughter Mary with the young archduke Charles, son of Philip of
Castile. <MILESTONE N="1508" UNIT="year"/> He entertained also some
intention of marriage for himself; first with the queen dowager of Naples,
relict of Ferdinand; afterwards with the dutchess dowager of Savoy, daughter
of Maximilian, and sister of Philip. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sickness of the King.</NOTE> But the decline
of his health put an end to all such thoughts; and he began to cast his eye
towards that future existence, which the iniquities and severities of his
reign rendered a very dismal prospect to him. To allay the terrors, under
which he laboured, he endeavoured, by distributing of alms and founding of
religious houses, to make attonement for his crimes, and to purchase, with
the sacrifice of part of his ill-gotten treasures, a recon∣cilement to his
offended Maker. Remorse even seized him by intervals for the abuses of
his authority by Empson and Dudley; but not sufficient to make him stop
the repacious hand of those oppressors. Sir William Capel was again fined
two thousand pounds under some frivolous pretences, and was committed to
the Tower for daring to murmur against that iniquity. Harris, an alderman of
London, was indicted, and died of vexation before his trial came to an
issue. Sir Lawrence Ailmer, who had been mayor, and his two sheriffs,
were condemned in heavy fines, and sent to prison till they made payment.
The King gave coun∣tenance to all these oppressions; till death, by its
nearer approaches, impressed new terror upon him; and he then ordered, by a
general clause in his will, that <PB N="60" REF="66"/>
<MILESTONE N="1509" UNIT="year"/> restitution should be made to all those
whom he had injured. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">His death. 22d April.</NOTE> He died of a
consumption at his favourite palace of Richmond, after a reign of
twenty-three years and eight months, and in the fifty-second year of his
age<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Dugd. baronage II. p. 237.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">And character</NOTE> THE reign of Henry the
seventh was, in the main, fortunate for his people at home, and honourable
abroad. He put an end to the civil wars with which the nation had been long
harrassed, he maintained peace and order in the state, he depressed
the former exorbitant power of the nobility, and, together with the
friendship of some foreign princes, he acquired the consideration and
regard of all. He loved peace without fearing war; tho' agitated with continual
suspicions of his servants and ministers, he discovered no timidity
either in the conduct of his affairs, or in the day of battle; and tho' often
severe in his punishments, he was commonly less actuated by revenge than
by the maxims of policy. The services, which he rendered the people, were
derived from his views of private interest, rather than the motives of public
spirit; and where he deviated from selfish regards, it was unknown to
himself, and ever from the malignant pre∣judices of faction or the mean
projects of avarice; not from the sallies of pas∣sion, or allurements of
pleasure; still less, from the benign motives of friendship and
generosity. His capacity was excellent, but somewhat contracted, by the
narrowness of his heart; he possessed insinuation and address,
but never em∣ployed these talents, except where some great point of
interest was to be gained; and while he neglected to conciliate the
affections of his people, he often felt the danger of resting his authority
on their fear and reverence alone. He was always extremely attentive to his
affairs, but possessed not the faculty of seeing far into futurity;
and was more expert at providing a remedy for his mistakes than judi∣cious in
avoiding them. Avarice was on the whole his ruling passion<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">As a proof of Henry's attention to the smallest profits,
Bacon tells us, that he had seen a book of Accompts kept by Empson, and
subscribed in almost every leaf by the King's own hand. Among other
articles was the following. 
<Q REND="inline">"<HI>Item,</HI> Received of such a one five
marks for a pardon, which, if it do not pass, the money to be repayed, or the
party otherwise satisfied."</Q> Opposite to this memo∣randum, the King
had wrote with his own hand, 
<Q REND="inline">"otherwise satisfied."</Q> Bacon, p.
630.</NOTE>; and he remains an instance, almost singular, of a man,
placed in a high station, and possessed of talents for great affairs,
in whom that passion predominated above ambition. Even among private
persons, avarice is commonly nothing but a species of ambition, and is
chiefly incited by the prospect of that regard, dis∣tinction and
consideration which are derived from riches.</P>
<P>THE power of the Kings of England had always been somewhat
irregular or discretionary; but was scarce ever so absolute during any
reign as during that of <PB N="61" REF="67"/> Henry. Besides the personal
character of the man, full of vigour, industry, and severity, deliberate in
all projects, steady in every purpose, and attended with caution, as well
as good fortune, in each enterprize; became to the throne after long and bloody
civil wars, which had destroyed all the great nobility, who alone could
resist the encroachments of his authority: The nation was tired with
discord and intestine convulsions, and willing to submit to
usurpations, and even injuries, rather than plunge themselves anew into
like miseries: The fruitless efforts made against him served always, as
is usual, to confirm his authority: As he ruled by a faction, and the
lesser faction, all those on whom he conferred offices, sensible that
they owed every thing to his protection, were content to support his power,
tho' at the expence of justice and national privileges: These seem the
chief causes which at this time bestowed on the crown so considerable
an addition of prerogative, and rendered the present reign a kind of epoch in
the English constitution.</P>
<P>THIS prince, tho' he exalted his own prerogative above law, is
celebrated by his historian for many good laws, which he caused to be
enacted for the govern∣ment of his subjects. Several considerable
regulations, indeed, are found among the statutes of this reign, both with
regard to the police of the kingdom, and its commerce: But the former are
commonly contrived with much better judge∣ment than the latter. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">His laws.</NOTE> The more simple ideas of
order and equity are sufficient to guide a legislator in every thing that
regards the internal administration of justice: But the principles of
commerce are much more complicated, and require long experience and deep
reflection to be well understood in any state. The real consequence of a
law or practice is there often contrary to first appearances. No wonder, that
during the reign of Henry the seventh, these matters were often
misunderstood; and it may safely be affirmed, that even in the age of
lord Bacon, very imperfect and erroneous ideas were formed on that
subject.</P>
<P>EARLY in Henry's reign, the authority of the Star Chamber, which
was be∣fore founded on common law and very ancient practice, was in some
cases con∣firmed by act of Parliament<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rot. Parl. 3.
H. 7. n. 17.</NOTE>: Lord Bacon extols the use of this court; but men began,
during the age of that historian, to feel that so arbitrary a
juris∣diction was totally incompatible with liberty; and in proportion as the
spirit of independance rose still higher in the nation, the aversion
against it increased, till it was entirely abolished by act of Parliament
in the reign of Charles the first, a little before the commencement of the
civil wars.</P>
<P>LAWS were passed in this reign, ordering the King's suit
for murder to be car∣ried on within a year and day<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">3. H. 7. cap. 1.</NOTE>. Formerly, it did not usually commence
till <PB N="62" REF="68"/> after that term; and as the friends of the person
murdered, in the interval, often compounded matters with the criminal, that
crime was apt to pass unpunished. Suits were given to the poor <HI>in forma
pauperis,</HI> as it is called: That is, without paying dues for the writs, or
any fees to the council<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">11 H 7. cap. 12.</NOTE>:
A good law at all times, especially in that age, when the people laboured
under the oppression of the great; but a law very difficult to be reduced
to execution. A law was made against carrying off any woman by force<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">3 H. 7. cap. 2.</NOTE>. The benefit of clergy was
abridged<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">4 H 7. cap. 13.</NOTE>, and the criminal,
on the first offence, was ordered to be burned in the hand with a letter
marking his crime; after which, he was punished capitally for every new
offence. This law was much too indulgent, yet was in those days regarded as a
violation of the rights of the church. Sheriffs were no longer allowed to fine
any person, without previously summoning him before their court<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">11 H. 7. cap. 15.</NOTE>. It is strange, that
such a practice should ever have prevailed. Attaint of juries was granted
in cases which exceeded forty pounds value<NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">11 H. 7.
cap. 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> H. 7. cap. 3.</NOTE>. A law which has an ap∣pearance of
equity, but which was afterwards found inconvenient. Actions po∣pular were not
allowed to be eluded by fraud or covin. If any servant of the King
conspired against the life of the steward, treasurer, or comptroller of
the King's house, this design, tho' not followed by any execution, was made
liable to the punishment of felony<NOTE N="††" PLACE="foot">3
H. 7. cap. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE>. This
statute was procured by the jealousy of archbishop Morton, who found
himself exposed to the enmity of great numbers.</P>
<P>THERE scarce passed any session during this reign
without some statute against engaging retainers, and giving them badges
or liveries<NOTE N="‡‡" PLACE="foot">3 H. 7. cap. 1. &amp; 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. 11 H. 7. cap. 3. 19 H 7. cap.
14.</NOTE>; a practice, by which they were, in a manner, inlisted under
some great lord, and were kept in readiness to assist him in all
wars, insurrections, riots, violences, and even in bearing evidence for him
in courts of justice<NOTE N="§§" PLACE="foot">3 H. 7. cap. 12. 11
H. 7. cap. 25.</NOTE>. This disorder, which had arisen during turbulent
times, when the law could give little protection to the subject, was then
deeply rooted in England; and it required all the vigilance and rigour of Henry
to extirpate it. There is a story of his severity against that abuse;
which seems to merit praise, tho' it is commonly cited as an instance of
his avarice and rapacity. The earl of Oxford, his favourite general, to whom he
always gave great and deserved trust, having splendidly entertained him
at his castle of Heningham, was desirous of making a show of his
magnificence at the departure of his royal guest; and ordered all his
retainers, with their liveries and badges, to be drawn up in two lines, that
their appearance might be more ga lant and splendid. 
<Q REND="inline">"My lord," said the King, "I have heard much
of your hospitality; but the truth far exceeds the report. These handsome
gentlemen <PB N="63" REF="69"/> and yeomen, whom I see on both sides of me,
are surely your menial servants."</Q> The earl smiled, and confessed
that his fortune was too narrow for such magnifi∣cence. 
<Q REND="inline">"They are most of them," subjoined he, "my
retainers, who are come to do me service at such a time, when they knew I
was honoured with your majesty's presence."</Q> The King started a
little, and said, 
<Q REND="inline">"By my faith, my lord, I thank you for my good
cheer, but I must not allow my laws to be broken in my sight. My attorney
must speak with you."</Q> Oxford is said to have payed no less than
fifteen thousand marks, as a composition for his offence.</P>
<P>THE encrease of the arts, more effectually than all the
severities of laws, put an end to this pernicious practice. The nobility,
instead of vying with each other, in the number and boldness of their
retainers, acquired a more civilized species of emulation, and endeavoured to
excell in the splendour and elegance of their equi∣page, houses, and
tables. The common people, no longer maintained in a vi∣cious idleness by
their superiors, were obliged to learn some calling or industry, and
became useful both to themselves and others. And it must be acknowledged,
in spite of those who declaim so violently against the refinement of
the art, or what they are pleased to call luxury, that, as much as an
industrious tradesman is both a better man and a better citizen that one of
those idle retainers, who fo merly de∣pended on the great families; as much
is the life of a modern nobleman more lau∣dable than that of an antient
baron.</P>
<P>BUT the most important law in its consequences, which was
enacted during the reign of Henry, was that by which the nobility and gentry
acquired a power of breaking the antient entails, and of alienating their
estates<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">4 H. 7. cap. 24.</NOTE>. By means of
this law, joined to the beginning luxury and refinements of the age, the great
fortunes of the barons were gradually dissipated, and the property of the
commons en∣creased in England. It is probable, that Henry foresaw and
intended this conse∣quence; because the constant scheme of his policy
consisted in depressing the great, and exalting churchmen, lawyers, and
men of new families, who were more dependant on him.</P>
<P>THIS King's love of money naturally led him to encourage
commerce, which encreased his customs; but, if we may judge by most of
the laws enacted during his reign, trade and industry were rather hurt than
promoted by the care and attention which were given to them. Severe laws were
made against taking in∣terest for money, which was then denominated
usury<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">3 H. 7. cap. 5.</NOTE>. Even the profits
of ex∣change were prohibited, as savouring of usury<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">3 H. 7. cap. 6.</NOTE>, which the superstition of that age
zealously proscribed. All evasive contracts, by which profits could be
made from the loan of money, were also carefully guarded against<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">7. H. 7. cap. 8.</NOTE>. It is needless to
observe how unreasonable and iniquitous these laws, how impossible to
be exe∣cuted, and how hurtful to trade, if they could take place. We may
observe, <PB N="64" REF="70"/> however, to the praise of this King, that
sometimes, in order to promote com∣merce, he lent to merchants sums of
money, without interest; when he knew, that their stock was not
sufficient for those enterprizes, which they proposed to undertake<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Polyd. Virg.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>LAWS were made against the exportation of money, plate, or
bullion<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">4 H. 7. cap. 23.</NOTE>: A precaution,
which serves no other purpose than to make more be exported. But so far
was the anxiety on this head carried, that merchant aliens, who im∣ported
commodities into the kingdom, were obliged to invest, in English
com∣modities, all the money acquired by their sales, in order to prevent
their convey∣ing away the money in a clandestine manner<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">3 H. 7. cap. 8.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>HORSES were forbid to be exported; as if that exportation did
not encourage the breed, and render them more plentiful<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">11 H. 7. cap. 13.</NOTE>. To promote archery, no bows were to be
sold at a higher price that six shillings and four pence<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">3 H. 7. cap. 12.</NOTE>, reducing money to the
denomination of our time. The only effect of this regulation must be either
that the people would be supplied with bad bows or none at all. Prices were
also affixed to woollen cloath<NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">4 H. 7. cap.
8.</NOTE>, to caps and hats<NOTE N="††" PLACE="foot">4 H. 7. cap.
9.</NOTE>: And labourers wages were regulated by law<NOTE N="‡‡" PLACE="foot">11 H. 7. cap. 22.</NOTE>. It is evident, that these
circumstances ought always to be left free, and must be trusted to the
common course of business and com∣merce. To some it may appear
surprizing, that the price of a yard of scarlet cloth should be limited
to six and twenty shillings, that of a yard of coloured cloth to eighteen;
higher prices than these commodities bear at present: And that the wages of
a tradesman, such as a mason, bricklayer, tyler, &amp;c. should be
regulated at near ten pence a day; which is not much inferior to the present
wages given in some places of England. There is a vulgar error in imagining,
that the price of labour and commodities has in general risen extremely
since the discovery of the West-Indies. The greater industry of the
present times has encreased the number of tradesmen and labourers, so
as to keep wages nearer a par than could be ex∣pected from the great encrease
of gold and silver. And the additional art em∣ployed in the finer
manufactures, has even made some of these commodities fall below their
former value. Not to mention, that merchants and dealers, being contented with
less profit than formerly, afford the goods cheaper to their custom∣ers. It
appears by a statute of this reign<NOTE N="§§" PLACE="foot">4 H. 7.
cap. 9.</NOTE>. that goods bought for sixteen pence would sometimes be
sold by the merchants for three shillings. The commodities, whose price
has chiefly risen, are butcher-meat, fowl, and fish, (especially the
latter) which cannot be much augmented in quantity by the encrease of art and
industry. The profession which then abounded most, and was embraced by
persons of the lowest rank, was the church: By a clause of a statute,
all clerks or students of the university were forbid to beg, without a
permission from the vice-chancellor<NOTE N="‖‖" PLACE="foot">11 H. 7. cap. 22.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="71"/> ONE great cause of the low state of
industry during this period, was the ridiculous restraints put upon it; and
the parliament, or rather the King, (for he was the prime mover in every thing)
enlarged a little some of these limitations; but not to the degree that was
requisite. A ridiculous law had been enacted during the reign of Henry the
fourth<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">7 H. 7. cap. 17.</NOTE>, that no man could bind
his son or daughter to an apprenticeship, unless he was possessed
of twenty shillings a year in land; and Henry the seventh, because the
decay of manufactures was complained of in Norwich from the want of hands,
exempted that city from the penalties of this law<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">11 H. 7. cap. 11.</NOTE>. Afterwards, the whole county of Norfolk
obtained a like exemption with regard to some branches of the woollen
manufacture<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">12 H. 7. cap 1.</NOTE>. These
absurd limita∣tions proceeded from a desire of promoting husbandry, which
however is never more effectually encouraged than by the encrease of
manufactures. For a like reason, the law enacted against inclosures, and
for the keeping up farm houses<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">4 H. 7. cap.
19.</NOTE>, scarce deserves the high praises bestowed on it by lord
Bacon. If husbandmen understand agriculture, and have a ready vent for
their commodities, we need never dread a diminution of the people, employed in
the country. All me∣thods of supporting populousness, except by the
interest of the proprietors, are violent and ineffectual. During a century
and a half after this period, there was a continual renewal of laws and edicts
against depopulation; whence we may infer, that none of them were ever
executed. The natural course of improvement at last provided a remedy.</P>
<P>ONE great check to industry in England was the erecting
corporations; an abuse which is not yet entirely corrected. A law was
enacted, that corporations should not pass any by-laws without the
consent of three of the chief officers of state<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">19 H. 7. cap. 7.</NOTE>. They were prohibited to impose tolls at
their gates<NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">19 H. 7. cap. 8.</NOTE>. The cities of
Glocester and Wor∣cester had even imposed tolls on the Severne, which
were abolished<NOTE N="††" PLACE="foot">19 H. 7. cap.
18.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THERE is a law of this reign<NOTE N="‡‡" PLACE="foot">12 H. 7. cap. 6.</NOTE>, containing a preamble, from which it
ap∣pears, that the company of merchant adventurers in London, had, by their own
proper authority, debarred all the other merchants of the kingdom, from trading
to the great marts in the low countries, unless each trader previously
payed them the sum of near seventy pounds. It is surprising that such
a by-law (if it deserves that name) could ever be carried into execution, and
that the authority of Parliament should be requisite to abrogate it.</P>
<P>IT was during this reign, on the second of August 1492, a
little before sun set, that Christopher Columbus, a Florentine, set out
from Cadiz on his memorable voyage for the discovery of the western world;
and a few years after, Vasquez de <PB N="66" REF="72"/> Gama, a Portuguese,
passed the cape of Good Hope, and opened a new passage to the East
Indies. These great events were attended with the most important
consequences to all the nations of Europe, even to such as were not
immediately concerned in those naval enterprizes. The enlargement of commerce
and naviga∣tion encr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ased
industry and the arts every where: The nobles dissipated their fortunes
in expensive pleasures: Men of an inferior rank both acquired a share in
the landed property, and created to themselves a considerable property of a
new kind, in stock, commodities, art, credit, and correspondence. In some
nations the privileges of the commons encreased, by this encrease of
property: In most nations, the Kings, finding arms to be dropt by the barons,
who could no longer endure their former rude manner of life, established
standing armies, and subdued the liberties of the kingdom: But in all
places, the condition of the people, from the depression of the petty
tyrants, by whom they had formerly been oppressed, rather than governed,
received great improvement, and they acquired, if not entire liberty, at
least the most considerable advantages of it. And as the gene∣ral
course of events thus tended to depress the nobles and exalt the people,
Henry the seventh, who also embraced that system of policy, has
acquired more praise, than his institutions, strictly speaking, seem
of themselves to deserve, on account of any profound wisdom attending
them.</P>
<P>IT was by accident only, that the King had not a considerable
hand in those great naval discoveries, by which the present age was so
much distinguished. Columbus, after meeting many repulses from the courts
of Portugal and Spain, sent his brother Bartholomew into England, in order to
explain his projects to Henry, and crave his protection for the execution of
them. Henry invited him to England; but his brother, in returning to Spain,
being taken by pyrates, was detained in his voyage; and Columbus, mean-while,
having obtained the coun∣tenance of Isabella, was equipped with a small
fleet, and happily executed his enterprize. Henry was not discouraged with
this disappointment: He fitted out Sebastian Cabot, a Venetian, dwelling in
Bristol; and sent him westwards in 1498 in search of new countries.
Cabot discovered the main land of America towards the sixtieth degree of
northern latitude: He sailed southwards along the coast, and discovered
Newfoundland, and other countries: But returned to England without making any
conquest or settlement. Elliot and other merchants in Bris∣tol made a
like attempt in 1502<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. XIII. p. 37.</NOTE>.
The King expended fourteen thousand pounds in building one ship called the
<HI>Great Harry</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Stowe, p. 484.</NOTE>. This
was properly speak∣ing the first ship in the English navy. Before this
period, when the prince wanted a fleet, he had no other expedient but the
hiring ships from the merchants.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="73"/> BUT though this improvement of navigation,
and the discovery of both the Indies, was the most memorable incident that
happened during this or any other period, it was not the only great event by
which the age was distinguished. In 1453 Constantinople was taken by the
Turks; and the Greeks, among whom some remains of learning were still
preserved, being scattered by these Barbarians, took shelter in Italy,
and imported, together with their admirable language, a tincture of their
science and their refined taste in poetry and eloquence. About the same
time, the purity of the Latin tongue was revived, the study of antiquity
became fashion∣able, and the esteem for literature gradually propagated
itself through every nation of Europe. The art of printing, invented about
that time, facilitated extremely the progress of all these improvements:
The invention of gunpowder changed the whole art of war: Mighty innovations
were soon after made in reli∣gion, such as not only affected those
states that embraced them, but even those that adhered to the antient faith
and worship: And thus a general revolution was made in human affairs
throughout this part of the world; and men attained that situation with
regard to commerce, arts, sciences, government, police, and cultivation, in
which they have ever since persevered. Here therefore com∣mences the
useful, as well as agreeable part of modern annals; certainty has place in
all the considerable, and even most of the minute parts of historical
narration; a great variety of events, preserved by printing, give the author
the power of selecting, as well as adorning, the facts, which he relates; and
as each incident has a reference to our present manners and situation,
instructive lessons occur every moment during the course of the
narration. Whoever carries his anxious researches into preceding periods is
moved by a curiosity, liberal in∣deed and commendable; not by any
necessity for acquiring a knowledge of public affairs, or the arts of civil
government.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE death of Henry the seventh had been attended with as open
and vi∣sible a joy as decency would permit; 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Popularity of the new King.</NOTE> and the
accession and coronation of his son, Henry the eighth, spread
universally a declared and unfeigned satisfaction. Instead of a monarch,
jealous, severe, and avaritious, who, in proportion as he advanced in years,
was sinking still deeper in those unpopular vices; a young prince of
eighteen had succeeded to the throne, who, even in the eyes of men of
sense, gave very promising hopes of his future conduct, much 
<PB N="70" REF="75"/> more in those of the people, always enchanted with
novelty, youth, and royal dignity. The beauty and vigour of his person,
accompanied with dexterity in every manly exercise, was farther adorned with
a blooming and ruddy counte∣nance, with a lively air, with the appearance of
spirit and activity in all his de∣meanour<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">T. Mori,
Lucubr. p. 182.</NOTE>. His father, in order to remove him from the knowledge
of public business, had hitherto occupied him entirely in the study of
literature; and the proficiency, which he made, gave no bad prognostic of his
parts and capacity<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Father Paul, lib. 1.</NOTE>.
Even the vices of vehemence, ardour, and impatience, to which he was subject,
and which afterwards degenerated into tyranny, were interpreted only as faults,
incident to unguarded youth, which would be corrected, when time had brought
him to greater moderation and maturity. And as the contending titles of York
and Lancaster were now at last fully united in his person, men justly
expected from a prince, obnoxious to no party, that impartiality of
administration, which had so long been unknown in England.</P>
<P>THE favourable prepossessions of the public were
encouraged by the measures, which Henry embraced in the commencement of his
reign. His grandmother, the countess of Richmond and Derby, was still
alive; and as she was a woman much celebrated for prudence and virtue, he
very wisely shewed great deference to her opinion in the establishment
of his new council. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">His ministers.</NOTE> The members were,
Warham, archbishop of Canterbury, and chancellor; the earl of Shrewsbury,
steward▪ lord Herbert, chamberlain; Sir Thomas Lovel, master of the
wards and consta∣ble of the Tower; Sir Edward Poynings, knight of the garter,
comptroller; Sir Henry Marney, afterwards lord Marney; Sir Thomas Darcy,
afterwards lord Darcy; Thomas Ruthal, doctor of laws; and Sir Henry Wyat<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Herbert, Stow, p. 486. Holling∣shed, p. 799.</NOTE>. These men
had been long accustomed to affairs under the late King, and were the least
un∣popular of all the ministers employed by that monarch.</P>
<P>BUT the chief competitors for favour and authority under the new
King were the earl of Surrey, treasurer, and Fox, bishop of Winchester,
secretary and privy seal. This prelate, who had enjoyed great credit during
all the former reign, had acquired such habits of caution and frugality as he
could not easily lay aside; and he still opposed, by his
remonstrances, those schemes of dissipation and ex∣pence, which the
youth and passions of Henry rendered agreeable to him. But Surrey was a
more dextrous courtier; and tho' few had borne a greater share in the frugal
politics of the last King, he knew how to conform himself to the hu∣mours
of his new master; and no one was so forward in promoting that libera∣lity,
pleasure, and magnificence, which began to prevail under the young
mo∣narch<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Lord Herbert.</NOTE>. By this policy he
ingratiated himself with Henry; he made profit, as <PB N="71" REF="76"/> well
as the other courtiers, of the lavish disposition of his master; and he
en∣gaged him in such a course of play and idleness as rendered him
negligent of af∣fairs, and willing to entrust the government of the state
entirely into the hands of his ministers. The immense treasures,
amassed by the late King, were gra∣dually dissipated in the giddy
expences of Henry. One party of pleasure suc∣ceeded another: Tilts,
tournaments and carousels were exhibited with all the magnificence of that
age: And as the present tranquillity of the public permitted the court to
indulge itself in every amusement, serious business was but little
attended to. Or if the King intermitted the course of his festivity, he
employed himself chiefly in an application to music and literature, which
were his favourite pursuits, and which were well adapted to his genius. He
had made such pro∣ficiency in the former art, as even to compose some
pieces of church music which were sung in his chapel<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Lord Herbert.</NOTE>. He was initiated in the elegant learning of
the antients. And tho' he was so unfortunate as to be seduced into a
study of the barren controversies of the schools, which were then
fashionable, and had chosen Thomas Aquinas for his favourite author, he
still discovered a capacity fitted for more useful and entertaining
knowledge.</P>
<P>THE frank and careless humour of the King, as it led him to
dissipate the treasures, amassed by his father, rendered him
negligent in protecting the instru∣ments, whom that prince had employed in
his extortions. A proclamation be∣ing issued to encourage complaints, the
rage of the people was let loose on all the delators and informers, who had
so long exercised an unbounded tyranny over the nation<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Herbert, Stow, p. 486. Hollingshed, p. 799. Pol. Virg. lib.
27.</NOTE>: They were thrown into prison, condemned to the pillory, and
most of them lost their lives from the violence of the populace. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Punishment of Empson and Dudley.</NOTE>
Empson and Dudley, who were most exposed to public hatred, were
immediately cited before the council, in order to answer for their conduct,
which had rendered them so ob∣noxious. Empson made a shrewd apology for
himself, as well as for his associate. He told the council, that so far
from his being justly exposed to censure for his past conduct, his
enemies themselves grounded their clamour on actions, which seemed rather
to merit reward and approbation: That a strict execution of law was the
crime, of which he and Dudley were accused; tho' that law had been
established by the voluntary consent of the people, and tho' they had
acted in obedience to the King, to whom the administration of justice was
entrusted by the constitution: That it belonged not to them, who were
in∣struments in the hands of the supreme power, to determine what laws were
re∣cent or obsolete, expedient or hurtful; since they were all alike valid,
so long <PB N="72" REF="77"/> as they remained unrepealed by the
legislature: That it was natural for a licentious populace to murmur
against the restraints of authority; but all wise states had ever made
their glory to consist in the just distribution of reward and
punishment, and had annexed the former to the observance and enforcement of
the laws, the latter to their violation and infraction: And that a sudden
over∣throw of all government might be expected; where the judges were committed
to the mercy of the criminals, the rulers to that of the subjects<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Herbert, Hollingshed, p. 804.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING this defence, Empson and Dudley were sent to
the Tower; and soon after brought to their trial. The strict execution of
laws, however obsolete, could never be imputed to them as a crime in a court
of ju∣dicature; and it is likely, that even where they had exercised
arbitrary power, the King, as they had acted by the secret commands of his
father, was not willing to have their conduct exposed to too severe a
scrutiny. In order, there∣fore, to gratify the people with the punishment
of these obnoxious ministers, crimes very improbable, or indeed
absolutely impossible, were charged upon them, that they had entered into
a conspiracy against the King, and had intended, on the death of the late
King, to have seized by force the administration of the government. The
jury were so far moved by popular prejudices, joined to court influence, as
to give sentence against them; which was afterwards con∣firmed by a bill of
attainder in Parliament<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This Parliament met on the
21st January, 1510. A law was there enacted, in order to prevent some
abuses which had prevailed during the late reign. The forfeiture upon the
penal statutes was reduced to the term of three years. Costs and damages
were given against informers upon acquital of the accused: More severe
punishments were enacted against perjury: the false inquisitions
procured by Empson and Dudley were declared null and invalid. Traverses
were allowed; and the time of tendering them enlarged. 1. H. 8. c. 8, 10, 11,

warrant from the King. Thus, in those arbitrary times, justice was equally
violated, whether the King sought power and riches, or courted
popularity.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">King's mar∣riage.</NOTE> THE King, while he
punished the instruments of past tyranny, had yet such deference to
former engagements as to deliberate, immediately after his accession,
concerning the consummation of his marriage with the infanta Catherine, to
whom he was affianced during his father's lifetime. Her former marriage with
his brother, and the inequality of their years, were the chief objections,
which were urged against the espousing her: But on the other hand, the
advantages of her known virtue, modesty, and sweetness of disposition
were insisted on; the affection which she bore the King; the large dowry
to which she was entitled as princess of Wales; the interest of cementing
a close alliance with Spain; the <PB N="73" REF="78"/> necessity of
finding some confederate to counterballance the power of France; the
expediency of fulfilling the engagements of the late King. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">June 3.</NOTE> When these considerations
were weighed, they determined the council, tho' contrary to the opinion of the
primate, to give Henry their advice for compleating the marriage; which was
done accordingly. The countess of Richmond, who had concurred in the same
sentiments, died soon after the marriage of her grandson.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1510" UNIT="year"/> THE popularity of Henry's
government, his indisputed title to the throne, his extensive authority,
his large treasures, the tranquillity of his subjects, were circumstances
which rendered his domestic administration easy and prosperous: 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Foreign af∣fairs.</NOTE> The situation of
foreign affairs was no less happy and desirable. Italy continued still,
as during the late reign, to be the center of all the wars and negotiations of
the European princes; and Henry's alliance was courted by both sides; at the
same time, that he was not engaged by any immediate interest or
necessity to take part with either. Lewis the twelfth of France, after the
conquest of Milan, was the only great prince who possessed any
territory in Italy; and could he have remained in tranquillity, he was enabled
by his situation to prescribe laws to all the Italian princes and
republics, and to hold the ballance among them. But the desire of making a
conquest of Naples, to which he had the same title or pre∣tension with
his predecessor, still engaged him in new enterprizes; and as he
foresaw opposition from Ferdinand, who was connected both by treaties and
affinity with Frederic of Naples, he endeavoured, by the offers of interest,
to which the ears of that monarch were ever open, to engage him in an
opposite confederacy. He settled with him a plan for the partition of the
Kingdom of Naples and the expulsion of Frederic: A plan, which the
politicians of that age regarded as the most egregious imprudence in the
French monarch, and the basest treachery in the Spanish. Frederic,
supported only by subjects, who were either discontented with his
government, or indifferent about his fortunes, was unable to resist so
powerful a confederacy, and was deprived of his dominions: But he had the
satisfaction to see Naples immediately prove the source of con∣tention
among his enemies. Ferdinand gave secret orders to his general, Gonsalvo,
whom the Spaniards honour with the appellation of the <HI>great captain,</HI>
to attack the armies of France, and make himself master of all the
dominions of Naples. Gonsalvo prevailed in every enterprize, defeated the
French in two pitched battles, and ensured to his prince the entire
possession of that fine kingdom. Lewis, unable to procure redress by
force of arms, was obliged to enter into a fruitless negotiation with
Ferdinand for the recovery of his share of the partition; <PB N="74" REF="79"/> and all Italy, during some time, was held in suspence between
these two power∣ful monarchs.</P>
<P>THERE scarce has been any period, when the ballance of power
was better secured in Europe, and seemed more able to maintain itself,
without any anxious concern or attention of the princes. Several great
monarchies were established; and no one so far surpassed the rest
as to give any foundation, or even pretence, for jealousy. England was united
in domestic peace, and by its situation happily secured from the
invasion of foreigners. The coalition of the several kingdoms of Spain, had
formed one powerful monarchy, which Ferdinand administered with arts,
fraudulent indeed and deceitful, but full of vigour and ability. Lewis the
twelfth of France, a gallant and generous prince, by espousing Anne of
Britanny, widow to his predecessor, had preserved the union with that
princi∣pality, on which the safety of his kingdom so much depended.
Maximilian, the emperor, besides the hereditary dominions of the Austrian
family, main∣tained authority in the empire, and notwithstanding his levity
of disposition, was able to unite the German princes in any great plan of
interest, at least, of de∣fence. Charles, prince of Castile, grandson
to Maximilian and Ferdinand, had already succeeded to the rich dominions of
the house of Burgundy; and being as yet in early youth, the government was
entrusted to Margaret of Savoy, his aunt, a princess endowed with signal
prudence and virtue. The internal force of these several powerful states,
which ballanced each other, might long have maintained general tranquillity,
had not the active and enterprizing genius of an ambitious pontiff first
excited the flames of war and discord among them.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Julius the 2d.</NOTE> ALEXANDER the sixth
was dead; a man of a singular character, and, except∣ing his son Caesar
Borgia, almost the only man who ever joined great capacity with the
blackest vices and the most abandoned profligacy of manners. After a
short interval, Julius the second had succeeded to the papal throne, who,
tho' endowed with many virtues, gave almost as much scandal to the world as
his de∣tested predecessor: His virtues were deemed unsuitable to his
station of sovereign pontiff, the spiritual judge and common father of
all christians. Animated with an unextinguishable thirst of glory,
inflexible in his schemes, undaunted in his enterprizes, indefatigable in his
pursuits; magnanimous, imperious, domi∣neering; his vast soul broke thro'

<P>THIS illustrious commonwealth, the great bulwark of Europe
against the Bar∣barians, and the admired model of civil poli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y, had risen to a considerable
power, and began to make a figure, which during that age bore some proportion
to that of the great monarchies. Her riches surpassed those of any
European city, her finances were great, her commerce extensive, her naval
power formidable, her armies numerous and well supplied. Trusting only to
her own power, she had neglected to maintain a cordial friendship with any
other state; and by the endless political suspicions, which she
entertained even of her allies, she had taught them to regard her progress
with like jealousy. No state could reasonably complain of any injustice
and usurpations in her measures: But as great monarchs never see with∣out
displeasure a republic nearly on a level with themselves, it was easy
for Julius, by his negotiations among the European princes, to compleat his
scheme of a confederacy against her. Ferdinand desired to wrest from
the Venetians some towns on the coast of Naples, which his predecessor
had voluntarily, for money, consigned into their hand: Lewis proposed to
recover a part of the territory of Milan, which he himself had delivered to
them by treaty: Maximilian laid claim to great part of their dominions, which
they had acquired from petty princes or tyrants, that had formerly, as he
pretended, in some distant period, usurped them from the empire: The
pope, from like pretences, challenged ano∣ther part of their dominions, as the
patrimony of the church. In order to cover the sch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me of this confederacy, the cardinal d'Amboise, prime
minister of France, had met at Cambray with Margaret of Savoy, under colour
of accommodating a difference between her and the duke of Guelders; and it was
there, that the alliance against Venice was secretly signed by the
contracting powers; and all the measures of operation concerted<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Guicciardini, lib. 8. Bembo</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE Venetians were apprised of their danger, and prepared
themselves for re∣sistance. They provided every means of defence, except
the most essential, brave and warlike forces, which it is impossible
to raise, where the ideas of military glory are extinguished, and men▪
have, from long habit, acquired other objects of ambition. They sent into the
field an army of 40,000 men under experienced l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aders, the count of Pi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>gliano and Bartholomew Alviano; and hop<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d, that so great a force would

Louis XII. St. Gelais, Guicciard. lib. 8.</NOTE>. Dismayed with this loss,
the Venetians took a hasty resolution of abandoning all their dominions on
the continent of Italy; and they accordingly withdrew their garrisons from
every place, and freed their subjects from their oaths of allegiance. Lewis
immediately put himself in possession of Cremona, Bergamo, Brescia,
Creme, and all the places which had been dismembered from the Milanese.
Even Verona, Padua, Vicenza, and other towns, which, by the treaty of Cambray,
fell under the partition of Maximilian, offered to open their gates to the
French monarch. Had Maximilian, instead of wasting his time at Trent, led
his forces early into Italy, an end had been put for ever to the power and
dominion of Venice. But Lewis, well acquainted with the fickleness and
inconstancy of that prince, was determined to give him no pretext for
deserting his alliance; and therefore ordered the magistrates of those
towns to make their submissions to the emperor, whom, he told them, they
were now to regard as their lawful sovereign<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Buonacorsi, Pettus de Angleria, epist. 418.</NOTE>. The
Venetian senate, observing those delays, and re∣marking the extreme
regret, which their subjects discovered on losing their mild and
equitable government<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Guicciard. lib. 8.</NOTE>,
began again to assume courage, and reinstated themselves in the
dominion of those cities, which they had abandoned. From this time, their
prudence and sound policy gave a cheque to the malignity of their fortune and
the superiority of their enemies. They voluntarily made a sacrifice to
Ferdinand of those towns, which he laid claim to, and thereby detached him
from the alliance<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Petrus de Angleria.</NOTE>. They
gratified the ambition of the Pope by a like sacrifice; and farther flattered
his vanity by the lowest obeisance and the most dutiful
sub∣missions<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Bembo.</NOTE>. After trying
like arts with Maximilian, and finding his pretensions to be utterly
exorbitant, they rouzed their patriot spirit, and prepared themselves for
resistance, with a courage, which, tho' ill seconded by the unwarlike
genius of their people, might have done honour to the Roman senate during the
most flourishing period of the republic.</P>
<P>THE great force and secure situation of the considerable
monarchies, prevented any one of them from aspiring to any conquest of
moment; and tho' this con∣sideration could not maintain general peace, or
remedy the natural inquietude of men, it rendered the princes of this age more
easy in deserting engagements and changing their alliances, in which they
were retained more by humour and caprice than by any natural or durable
interest. Julius had no sooner humbled the Venetian republic, than he was
inspired with a nobler ambition, that of <PB N="77" REF="82"/> expelling all
foreigners from Italy, or, to speak in the stile affected by the Ita∣lians
of that age, the freeing that country entirely from the dominion of the
Barbarians<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Guicciard. lib. 8.</NOTE>. He was determined
to make the tempest fall first upon Lewis; and in order to pave the way for
this great enterprize, he at once sought for a ground of quarrel with that
monarch, and courted the alliance of other princes. He declared war against
the Duke of Ferrara, the closest confederate of Lewis. He sollicited the
favour of England, by sending Henry a sacred rose, perfumed with musk
and anointed with chrism<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Spelman, Concil. vol.
2. p. 725.</NOTE>. He engaged in his interest Bambrige, archbishop of York,
and Henry's ambassador at Rome, whom he soon after created cardinal. He
drew over Ferdinand to his side, tho' that monarch, at first, made no
declaration of his intentions. And what he chiefly valued, he framed a treaty
with the Swiss cantons, who, enraged by some neglects put upon them by
Lewis, accompanied with contumelious expressions, had deserted the
alliance of France, and waited an opportunity of revenging themselves on that
nation.</P>
<P>LEWIS was determined not to abandon the duke of Ferrara, who
suffered merely for his attachment to the crown of France. Chaumont, his
lieutenant in the Milanese, received orders to defend him against Julius,
who, supported by his own dauntless spirit, and confiding in the
sacredness of his character, had set his enemy at defiance. By a happy
and unexpected movement, Chaumont surrounded the pope and all his court in
Bologna; and had he not allowed him∣self to be amused by a treaty, which
his profound respect for the holy father made him the more willing to hearken
to, he had been able, without any blood∣shed, to have reduced him to
captivity. Finding himself exposed to severe censure for not pushing
his advantages, he was agitated with such violent regret that he fell into a
languishing illness, of which he soon after died; tho' opposite
remorses took place on his death-bed, and he very humbly claved of his
holiness a remission of his grievous sin, in having at all born arms
against him<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">L'abbé du Bos, Histoire
de la Ligue de Cambray.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1511" UNIT="year"/> WHILE the French monarch
repelled the attacks of his enemies, he thought it also requisite to make
an attack on the pope himself, and to despoil him, as much as possible,
of that sacred character, which chiefly rendered him formidable. He engaged
some cardinals, disgusted with the violence of Julius, to desert him;
and by their authority, he was determined, in conjunction with Maximillan, who
still adhered to his alliance, to call a general council, which might reform
the church, and check the exorbitancies of the Roman pontiff. A council was 
<PB N="78" REF="83"/> summoned at Pisa, which from the beginning bore a very
inauspicious aspect, and promised little success to its adherents.
Except a few French bishops, who un∣willingly obeyed their King's orders in
attending the council, all the other pre∣lates kept at a distance from an
assembly, which they regarded as the offspring of faction, intrigue, and
worldly politics. Even Pisa, the place of their residence, showed them
signs of contempt; which engaged them to transfer their session to
Milan, a town under the dominion of the French monarch. Notwithstanding this
advantage, they did not experience much more respec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> treatment from the inhabitants of Milan; and found it
necessary to make another <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>move
to Lyons<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Guicciardini, lib. 10.</NOTE>. Lewis himself
fortified these violent prejudices in favour of
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> papa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> authority, by the symptoms, which he discovered, of
regard, deference, and submission to Julius, whom he always spared,
even when fortune had thrown into his hands the most inviting opportunities
of humbling him. And as it was known, that his consort, who had great
authority with him, was extremely disquieted in mind, on account of his
dissentions with the holy father, all men prog<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>osticated to Julius final success in this unequal
contest.</P>
<P>THAT enterprizing pope knew his advantages, and availed
himself of them with the utmost temerity and insolence. So much had he
neglected his pontifical character, that he assisted in person at the
siege of Mirandola, visited the trenches, saw some of his attendants
killed by his side, and, like a young sol∣dier, chearfully bore all the
rigours of winter and a severe season, in pursuit of military
glory<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Guicciardini, lib. 9.</NOTE>: Yet was he
still able to throw, even on his most moderate oppo∣nents, the charge of
impiety and prophaneness. He summoned a council at the Lateran: He put
Pisa under an interdict, and all the places which gave shelter to the
schismatical council: He excommunicated the cardinals and prelates who
at∣tended it: He even directed his spiritual thunders against the princes
who adhered to it: He freed their subjects from all oaths of allegiance, and
gave their do∣minions to every one, who could take possession of

<P><MILESTONE N="1512" UNIT="year"/> FERDINAND of Arragon, who had
acquired the sirname of the Catholic, re∣garded the cause of the pope and

naturally sincere and sanguine in his temper, and the more so on account
of his youth and inexperience, was moved with a hearty de∣sire of protecting
the pope from that oppression, to which he believed him exposed from the
ambitious enterprizes of Lewis. Hopes had been given him by Julius, that the
title of the <HI>most Christian King,</HI> which had hitherto been annexed
to the crown of France, and which was regarded as its most precious ornament,
would, <PB N="79" REF="84"/> in reward of his services, be transferred to that
of England<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Guicciard. lib. 11. P. Daniel, vol. II. p.

that distinction in Europe, to which his power and opulence entitled him, he
could not long remain neuter amidst the noise of arms; and the natural
enmity of the English against France, as well as their antient claims upon
that kingdom, led Henry to join that alliance which the pope, Spain, and Venice
had formed against the French monarch. A herald was sent to Paris, to
exhort Lewis not to wage impious war against the pope; and when he returned
without success, another was sent to make a demand of the antient

<P>BUONAVISO, an agent of the pope at London, had been corrupted by
the court of France, and had previously revealed to Lewis all the measures
which Henry was concerting against him. But this infidelity did the King
inconside∣rable prejudice, in comparison of what he experienced from the
selfish purposes of the ally, to whom he chiefly trusted for
assistance. Ferdinand, his father-in-law, had so long persevered in a
course of crooked politics, that he began even to value himself on his
dexterity in fraud and artifice; and he made a boast of those shame∣ful
successes. Being told one day, that Lewis the twelfth, a prince of a very
different character, had complained that he had once cheated him: 
<Q REND="inline">"He lies, the drunkard!" said he, "I have
cheated him above twenty times."</Q> This prince considered his close
connexion with Henry, only as the means which ena∣bled him the better to take
advantage of his want of experience. He ad∣vised him not to invade France by
the way of Calais, where he himself would not have it in his power to
assist him: 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Expedition to Fontarabia.</NOTE> He exhorted
him rather to send forces to Fon∣tarabia, whence he could easily make a
conquest of Guienne, a province, in which, it was imagined, the English had
still some adherents. He promised to assist this conquest by the
junction of a Spanish army. And so forward did he seem to promote the
interest of his son-in-law, that he even sent vessels into England,
to transport over the forces which Henry had levied for that purpose. The
marquess of Dorset commanded these troops, which consisted of ten
thousand men, mostly infantry; the lord Howard, son to the earl of
Surrey, the lord Broke, lord Fer∣rars, and many others of the young gentry and
nobility, accompanied him in this service. All were on fire to
distinguish themselves by military atchievements, and to make a
conquest of importance for their master. The secret purpose of
Ferdi∣nand in this unexampled generosity was suspected by no body.</P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="85"/> THE small kingdom of Navarre lies on the
frontiers between France and Spain; and as John d'Albert, the present King,
was connected in friendship and alliance with Lewis, the opportunity seemed
favourable to Ferdinand, while the English forces were conjoined with his
own, and while all adherents to the council of Pisa lay under the sentence
of excommunication, to put himself in possession of these
dominions. No sooner, therefore, was Dorset landed in Guipiscoa, than the
Spanish monarch declared his readiness to join him with his forces, to make
jointly an invasion of France, and to form the siege of Bayonne, which
opened the way into Guienne<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Herbert. Hollingshed, p
813.</NOTE>: But he remarked, how dangerous it might prove to leave behind them
the kingdom of Navarre, which, being in close alliance with France, could
easily give admittance to the enemy, and cut off all communication between
Spain and the combined armies. To provide against so dangerous an event, he
required, that John should stipulate a neutrality in the present war; and
when that prince expressed his willingness to enter into any engagement
for that purpose, he also required that he should give security for his
strict observance of it. John having likewise agreed to this condition,
Ferdinand demanded, that he should deliver into his hands six of the most
considerable places of his dominions, together with his eldest son as a
hostage. These were not conditions to be proposed to a sovereign; and
as the Spanish monarch expected a refusal, he gave immediate orders to the
duke of Alva, his general, to make an invasion of Navarre, and to reduce the
whole kingdom to subjection. Alva soon made himself master of all the
smaller towns; and being ready to form the siege of Pampeluna, the capital,
he summoned the marquis of Dorset to join him with the English army, and
to concert together all their operations.</P>
<P>DORSET began to suspect, that his master's interests
were very little regarded in all these transactions; and having no orders
to invade the kingdom of Navarre, or make war any where but in France, he
refused to take any part in that enter∣prize .<NOTE PLACE="marg">Deceit of
Fer∣dinand.</NOTE> He remained therefore in his quarters at Fontarabia; but
so politic was the contrivance of Ferdinand, that even while the English
army lay in that situ∣ation, it was almost equally serviceable to his
purposes, as if it had acted in con∣junction with his own. It kept the French
army in awe, and prevented it from advancing to succour the kingdom of
Navarre; so that Alva, having full leisure to conduct the siege, made
himself master of Pampeluna, and obliged John to seek for shelter in
France. The Spanish general applied again to Dorset, and pro∣posed to
conduct with united councils the operations of the <HI>holy league,</HI> so
it was called, against Lewis: But as he still declined forming the siege
of Bayonne, and rather insisted on the invasion of the principality of
Bearne, a part of the King <PB N="81" REF="86"/> of Navarre's dominions, which
lies on the French side of the Pyrences, Dorset, justly suspicious of
his sinister intentions, represented, that, without new orders from his
master, he could not concur in such an undertaking. In order to pro∣cure
such orders, Ferdinand dispatched Martin de Ampios, as his envoy, to
Lon∣don; and perswaded Henry, that, by the refractory and scrupulous humour
of the English general, the most favourable opportunities were lost, and
that it was necessary he should, in all things, act in concert with the
Spanish commander, who was best acquainted with the situation of the
country, and the reasons of every operation. But before orders to this
purpose reached Spain, Dorset had become extremely impatient; and
observing that his farther stay served not to promote the main
undertaking, and that his army was daily perishing by want and sickness,
he demanded shipping from Ferdinand to transport them back into England.
Ferdinand, who was bound by treaty to furnish him with this supply,
whenever demanded, was at last, after many delays, obliged to yield to his
im∣portunity; and Dorset embarked his troops, and prepared himself for the
voyage. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Return of the English.</NOTE> Mean while, a
messenger arrived with orders from Henry, that the troops should remain
in Spain; but the soldiers were so discontented with the treatment which
they had met with, that they mutinied, and obliged their commanders to set
sail for England. Henry was much displeased with the ill success of
this en∣terprize; and it was with difficulty, that Dorset, by explaining the
fraudulent intentions of Ferdinand, was at last able to appease him.</P>
<P>THERE happened this summer an action at sea, which brought
not any more decisive advantage to the English. Sir Thomas Knevet, master
of Horse, was sent to the coast of Britanny with a fleet of forty-five
sail; and he carried with him Sir Charles Brandon, Sir John Carew, and many
other young courtiers, who longed for an opportunity of displaying their
valour. After committing some depredations, a French fleet of thirty-nine
sail issued from Brest, under the command of Primauget<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Or rather Porsmauget, according to P. Daniel's conjecture,
vol. II. p. 1901. Hence the English seamen called him Sir Pierce
Morgan.</NOTE>, and began an engagement with the English. Primauget's ship
was set on fire, who finding his destruction inevitable, bore down upon the
vessel of the English admiral, and grappling with her, resolved to make
her share the same fate. The ships of both fleets stood some t me in
sus∣pence, as spectators of this dreadful engagement; and all men saw
with horror the flames which consumed both vessels, and heard the cries
of fury and despair which came from the miserable combatants. At last,
the French vessel blew up; and at the same time destroyed the
English<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Polydore Virg. lib. 27. Stow, p 490.

fleet made their escape into different harbours.</P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="87"/> THE war, which England waged against
France, though it brought little advantage to the former kingdom, was of
infinite prejudice to the latter; and by obliging Lewis to withdraw his forces
for the defence of his own dominions, lost him that superiority, which his
arms, in the beginning of the campaign, had at∣tained in Italy. Gaston de
Foix, his nephew, a young hero, had been entrusted with the command of the
French forces; and in a few months performed such feats of military art and
prowess, as were sufficient to render illustrious the whole life of the
oldest captain<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Guicciard, lib. 10.</NOTE>. His
carreer finished with the great battle of Ravenna, which, after the most
obstinate conflict, he gained over the Spanish and papal armies. He
perished the very moment his victory was compleat; and with him perished
the fortune of the French arms in Italy. The Swiss, who had rendered
themselves extremely formidable by their bands of disciplined infantry,
invaded the Milanese with a numerous army, and raised up that inconstant
people to a revolt against the dominion of France.
<MILESTONE N="1513" UNIT="year"/> Genoa followed the example of that dutchy;
and thus Lewis, in a few weeks, entirely lost his Italian conquests,
ex∣cept some garrisons; and Maximilian Sforza, the son of Ludovic, was
again re-instated in possession of Milan.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">21st of Fe∣bruary.</NOTE> JULIUS
discovered extreme joy on the discomfiture of the French; and the more
so, that he had been beholden for it to the Swiss, a people, whose
councils, he hoped, he should always be able to govern and direct. The
pontiff survived this success a very little time; 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Leo the tenth.</NOTE> and in his place was
chosen John de Medici, who took the appellation of Leo the tenth, and proved

soul no less capa∣ble of forming great designs than his predecessor,
but was more gentle, pliant, and artful in employing means for the execution of
them. By his in∣trigues, the emperor Maximilian was detached from the French
interest; and Henry, notwithstanding his disappointments in the former
campaign, was still encouraged to prosecute his warlike measures
against Lewis.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A Parliament.</NOTE> HENRY had summoned a
new session of Parliament<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">4th of November,
1512.</NOTE>, and obtained a supply for his enterprize. It was a poll-tax,
and imposed different sums, according to the station and riches of the
person. A duke payed ten marks, an earl five pounds, a lord four pounds, a
knight four marks; every man valued at eight hundred pounds in goods, four
marks. An imposition was also granted of two fifteenths and four
tenths<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Stowe.</NOTE>. With these supplies,
joined to the treasure which was left by his father, and which was not yet
entirely dissipated, he was enabled to levy a great army, and render
himself very formidable to his enemy. The <PB N="83" REF="88"/> English are
said to have been much encouraged in this enterprize, by the arrival of a
vessel in the Thames under the papal banner. It carried presents of wine
and hams to the King, and all the most eminent courtiers; and such fond
devo∣tion was at that time entertained towards the court of Rome, that these
trivial presents were every where received with the greatest triumph and
exultation.</P>
<P>IN order to prevent all disturbance from Scotland, while the
King's arms should be employed on the continent, Dr. West, Dean of
Windsor, was dispatched in an embassy to James, the King's
brother-in-law; and instructions were given him to accommodate all
differences between the kingdoms, as well as discover the intentions of the
court of Scotland<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Polydore Virgil, lib. 27.</NOTE>.
Some complaints had already passed on both sides. One Barton, a
Scotchman, having suffered some injuries from the Portugueze, for which he
could obtain no redress, had procured letters of marque against that
nation; but not content with this liberty, he committed de∣predations upon the
English, and much infested the narrow seas<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Stowe, p. 489. Hollingshed, p. 811.</NOTE>. Lord How∣ard and Sir
Edward Howard, admirals, and sons to the earl of Surrey, sailing out
against him, fought him in a desperate rencounter, where the pyrate was
killed; and they brought his ships into the Thames. As Henry refused all
satisfaction for this act of justice, some of the borderers, who wanted
but a pretence for depredations, entered England under the command of lord
Hume, warden of the marches, and committed great ravages on that kingdom.
Not∣withstanding these mutual grounds of dissatisfaction, matters might
easily have been accommodated, had it not been for Henry's intended
invasion of France, which rouzed up the jealousy of the Scotch nation<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Buchannan, lib. 13. Drummond in the life of James
IV.</NOTE>. The antient league, which subsisted betwixt France and
Scotland, was conceived to be the strongest band of connexion; and the
Scotch universally believed, that, were it not for the coun∣tenance which
they received from this foreign alliance, they had never been able so long to
maintain their independance against a people so much superior in force
and riches. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">War with Scotland.</NOTE> James was farther
incited to take part in the quarrel by the invitations of Anne, queen of
France, whose knight he had ever in all tournaments profest him∣self, and
who summoned him, according to the ideas of romantic gallantry, pre∣valent in
that age, to take the field in her defence, and prove himself her true and
valorous champion. The remonstrances of his consort and of his wisest
counsellors, were in vain opposed to the martial ardour of that prince. He
first sent a squadron of ships to the assistance of France; the
only fleet which Scotland seems ever to have possessed. And though he
made profession still to maintain a neutrality, the English
ambassador easily foresaw, that a war would <PB N="84" REF="89"/> prove
in the end inevitable, and he gave his master warning of the danger, who
sent the earl of Surrey to put the borders in a posture of defence, and to
resist the invasion of the enemy.</P>
<P>HENRY, all on fire for military
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ame, was little discouraged by
this appearance of a diversion from the North; and so much the less, that
he flattered himself with the assistance of all the considerable
potentates of Europe in his invasion of France. The pope still continued to
thunder out his excommunications against Lewis, and all the adherents to the
schismatical council: The Swiss cantons made professions of the
most violent animosity against France: The ambassadors of Ferdinand
and Maximilian had signed with those of Henry a treaty of alliance
against that power, and had stipulated the time and place of their intended
inva∣sion: And though Ferdinand disavowed his ambassador, and even
signed a truce for a twelvemonth with the common enemy; Henry was not yet
fully con∣vinced of his selfish and sinister intentions, and still
hoped for his concurrence after the expiration of that term. He had now got a
minister who complied with all his inclinations, and flattered him in every
scheme to which his sanguine and impetuous temper was inclined.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Wolsey mi∣nister.</NOTE> THOMAS WOLSEY,

excellent capacity, he was admitted into the marquis of Dorset's family as
tutor to that nobleman's children, and soon gained the friendship and
countenance of his patron<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Stowe, p. 997.</NOTE>. He was
recommended as chaplain to Henry the seventh, and being employed by that

his conduct<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Cavendish, Fiddes's life of

emperor, who at that time resided in Brussels, was surprized, in less
than three days after, to see Wolsey present himself before him; and
supposing that he had protracted his departure, he began to reprove him for
the dilatory execution of his orders. Wolsey informed him, that he was just
returned from Brussels, and had success∣fully fulfilled all his

majesty's intentions."</Q> The death of Henry, soon after this incident,
was the reason why Wolsey reaped no advantage from the good opinion, which
that monarch had entertained of him: But from that moment he was looked on at
court as a rising man; and the bishop of Winchester cast his eye upon
him as one, who might be serviceable to him in his present situation<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Antiq. Brit. Ecles. p. 309. Polydore Virgil, lib.
27.</NOTE>. This prelate, observing that the earl of Surrey had total∣ly
eclipsed him in favour, resolved to introduce Wolsey into the young
prince's familiarity, and hoped, that he might rival Surrey in his
insinuating arts, and yet be contented to act in the cabinet a part
subordinate to Fox himself, who had promoted him. In a very little time,
Wolsey gained so much on Henry's good graces, that he supplanted both
Surrey in his favour, and Fox in his trust and confidence. Being admitted to
the King's parties of pleasure, he took the lead in every jovial
conversation, and promoted all that frolic and entertainment, which he found
suitable to the age and inclination of the young monarch. Nei∣ther his own
years, which were near forty, nor his character of a clergyman, were any
restraint upon him, or engaged him to check, by any useless severity,
the gaiety, in which Henry, who had small propension to debauchery,
passed his careless hours. During the intervals of amusement he
introduced business and state affairs, and insinuated those maxims of
conduct, which he was desirous his master should adopt. He observed to
him, that, while he entrusted his affairs into the hands of his father's
counsellors, he had the advantage of employing men of wisdom and
experience, but men who owed not their promotion to his fa∣vour, and who
scarce thought themselves accountable to him for the exercise of their
authority: That by the factions, and cabals, and jealousies, which pre∣vailed
among them, they more obstructed the advancement of his affairs, than they
promoted it by the knowledge which age and practice had conferred upon them:
That while he thought proper to pass his time in those pleasures, to
which his age and royal fortune invited him, and in those studies, which
would in time enable him to sway the scepter with absolute authority, his
best system of govern∣ment would be to intrust his authority into the
hands of some one person, who was the creature of his will, and who could
entertain no view but of promoting his service: And that if this minister
had also the same relish for pleasure with him∣self, and the same
taste for science; he could the more easily account to him for his whole
conduct, and introduce his master gradually into the knowledge of pub∣lic
businēss, and thus, without tedious constraint or application, initiate
him in the science of government<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Cavendish,
p. 12. Stowe, 499.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="86" REF="91"/> HENRY entered into all the views of
Wolsey; and finding no one so capable of executing this plan of
administration as the person who proposed it, he soon advanced his
favourite, from being the companion of his careless hours, to be a member of
his council; and from being a member of his council, to be his sole and
absolute minister. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">His character.</NOTE> By this rapid
advancement and uncontrouled autho∣rity, the character and genius of Wolsey
had full opportunity to display itself. Insatiable in his acquisitions,
but still more magnificent in his expence: Of ex∣tensive capacity, but
still more unbounded enterprize: Ambitious of power, but still more
desirous of glory: Insinuating, engaging, persuasive; and, by turns,
lofty, elevated, commanding: Haughty to his equals, but affable to his
depen∣dants; oppressive to the people, but liberal to his friends; more
generous than grateful; less moved by injuries than by contempt; he seemed
framed to take the ascendant in every intercourse with others, but exerted
this superiority of <HI>nature</HI> with such ostentation as exposed
him to envy, and made every one willing to recal the original inferiority or
rather meanness of his <HI>fortune.</HI></P>
<P>THE branch of administration, in which Henry most exerted
himself, while he gave his entire confidence to Wolsey, was the military,
which, as it suited the natural gallantry and bravery of his temper, as well
as the ardour of his youth, was the principal object of his attention. Finding,
that Lewis had made great preparations both by sea and land to resist
him, he was no less careful to raise a formidable army and equip a
considerable fleet for the invasion of France. The command of the fleet was
entrusted to Sir Edward Howard; who, after scouring the channel some
time, presented himself before Brest, where the French navy then lay; and
he challenged them to a combat. The French admiral, who ex∣pected from the
Mediterranean a reinforcement of some Gallies under the com∣mand of Prejeant
de Bidoux, kept within the harbour, and saw with patience the English burn
and destroy the country in the neighbourhood. At last Prejeant arrived with
six gallies, and put into Conquet, a place within a few leagues of Brest,
where he secured himself behind some batteries, which he had planted on
rocks, that lay on each side of him. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">25th April.</NOTE> Howard was
notwithstanding determined to make an attack; and as he had but two gallies,
he took himself the command of one, and gave the other to Devereux lord
Ferrars. He was followed by some row-barges and some crayers under the
command of Sir Thomas Cheyney, Sir William Sidney, and other officers of
distinction. He immediately fastened on Prejeant's ship, and leaped on
board of her, attended with one Carroz, a Spa∣nish cavalier, and seventeen
English more. The cable, meanwhile, which fastened his ship to that of
the enemy, being cut, the admiral was thus left in the hands of the French; and
as he still continued the fight with great gallantry, he was 
<PB N="87" REF="92"/> pushed overboard by their pikes<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It was a maxim of Howard's, that no admiral was good for any
thing, that was not brave even to a degree of madness. As the sea-service
requires much less plan and contrivance and capacity than the land, this
maxim has great plausibility and appearance of truth: Tho' the fate of Howard
himself may serve as a proof that even there courage ought to be tempered
with discretion.</NOTE>. Lord Ferrars, seeing the admiral's galley fall
off, followed with the other vessels; and the whole fleet was so
discouraged by the loss of their admiral, that they retired from before
Brest<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Stowe, p. 491. Herbert, Hollingshed,
p. 816.</NOTE>. The French navy came out of harbour; and even ventured to
invade the coast of Sussex. They were repulsed, and Prejeant, their
admiral, lost an eye by the shot of an arrow. Lord Howard, brother to the
deceased admiral, received the command of the English fleet; and little
memorable passed at sea during this summer.</P>
<P>GREAT preparations had been making at land, during the whole
winter, for an invasion of France by the way of Calais; but the summer was
well advanced before every thing was in sufficient readiness for the
intended enterprize. The long peace, which the kingdom had enjoyed, had
somewhat unfitted the English for military expeditions; and the great
change, which had lately been introduced in the art of war, had rendered it
still more difficult to inure them to the use of the weapons now employed
in action. The Swiss, and after them the Spaniards, had shown the advantage
of a stable infantry, who fought with pike and sword, and were able to
repulse even the heavy-armed cavalry, in which the great force of the armies
formerly consisted. The practice of fire-arms was become very common; tho'
the caliver, which was the weapon now used, was so inconvenient, and
attended with so many disadvantages, that it had not entirely discredited
the use of bows, a weapon in which the English excelled all European
nations. The English archers still maintained their reputation; and even
during the present reign, the king's allies had sollicited him for
supplies of this kind. The second year after his accession, he sent a
thousand archers, under the command of lord Dacres, to the assistance
of Ferdinand, his father-in-law, in his projected expe∣dition against the
Moors of Barbary; but as that prince turned his arms against the French in
Italy, Darcy was sent back without being employed in any service. The King
had also sent fifteen hundred archers under the command of Sir Edward
Poinings to the assistance of Margaret, dutchess of Savoy, who made
use of them with great advantage against the duke of Guelders, the great
disturber of the Netherlands. A considerable part of the forces, which
Henry now levied for the invasion of France, consisted also of archers;
and so soon as affairs were in readiness, the vanguard of the army,
amounting to 8000 men, under the com∣mand of the earl of Shrewsbury, sailed
over to Calais. Shrewsbury was accom∣panied <PB N="88" REF="93"/> with the
earl of Derby, the lords Fitzwater, Hastings, Cobham, and Sir Rice ap Thomas,
captain of the light horse. Another Body of 6000 men soon after followed
under the command of lord Herbert, the chamberlain, attended with the earls of
Northumberland and Kent, the lords Audley and Delawar, together with Carew,
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urson, and other gentlemen.</P>
<P>THE King himself prepared to follow with the main body and
rear of the army; and he appointed the queen regent of the kingdom during his
absence. That he might secure her administration from all disturbance,
he ordered Edmond de la Pole, earl of Suffolk, to be beheaded in the Tower, the
nobleman who had been attainted and imprisoned during the late reign. The
King was led to com∣mit this act of violence by the dying commands, as is
imagined, of his father, who told him, that he never would be free from danger,
while a man of so tur∣bulent a disposition as Suffolk was alive. And as
his brother, Richard de la Pole, had accepted of a command in the French
service, and attempted very foolishly to revive the York faction, and to
animate them against Henry, he probably drew more suddenly the King's
vengeance on the unhappy Suffolk.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">30th of June.</NOTE> AT last, Henry,
attended with the duke of Buckingham and many others of the nobility, arrived
in Calais, and entered upon his French expedition, whence he fondly expected
so much success and glory<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Polydore Virgil, lib.
27. Belcarius, lib. 14.</NOTE>. Of all those allies, on whose
assistance he so much relied, the Swiss alone fully performed their
engagements. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Invasion of France.</NOTE> Being put in
motion by a sum of money sent them by Henry, and incited by their victories
obtained in Italy, and by their animosity against France, they were
prepar∣ing to enter that kingdom with an army of twenty-five thousand men;
and no equal force could be opposed to their incursion. Maximilian had
received an advance of 120,000 crowns from Henry, and had engaged to reinforce
the Swiss with 8000 men, but failed in his engagements. That he might make
atone∣ment to the King, he himself appeared in the Low Countries, and joined
the English army with some German and Flemish soldiers, who were
useful in giving an example of discipline to Henry's new-levied forces.
Observing the disposition of the English monarch to be more bent on
glory than on interest, he inlisted himself in his service, wore the
cross of St. George, and received pay, a hundred crowns day, as one of his
subjects and captains. But while he exhibited this ex∣traordinary
spectacle, of an emperor of Germany serving under a King of Eng∣land, he
was treated with the highest respect by Henry, and really directed all the
operations of the combined army.</P>
<P>BEFORE the arrival of Henry and Maximilian in the camp, the earl
of Shrews∣bury and lord Herbert had formed the siege of Teroüane, a
town situate on <PB N="89" REF="94"/> the frontiers of Picardy; and they began
to attack the place with vigour. Teligini and Crequi commanded in the town, and
had a garrison, which exceeded not a thousand men; yet made they such
stout resistance as protracted the siege a month; and they found
themselves at last more in danger from want of pro∣visions and ammunition
than from the assaults of the besiegers. Having con∣veyed intelligence of
their situation to Lewis, who had advanced to Amiens with his army, that
prince gave orders to throw relief into the place. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">16th August.</NOTE> Fontrailles appeared at
the head of 800 horsemen, each of whom carried a sack of gun∣powder behind
him, and two quarters of bacon. With this small force he made a sudden and
unexpected irruption into the English camp, and surmounting all
resistance, advanced▪ to the fossee of the town, where each
horseman threw down his burthen. They immediately returned at the gallop, and
were so fortunate as again to break thro' the English, and to receive
little or no loss, in this dan∣gerous attempt<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hist.
de Chev. Bayard, ch. 57. Memoires de Bellai.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Battle of Gui∣negate.</NOTE> BUT the
English had, soon after, full revenge for that insult. Henry had
re∣ceived intelligence of the approach of the French Horse, who had advanced
to protect this incursion of Fontrailles; and he ordered some troops to
pass the Lis, in order to oppose them. The cavalry of France, tho' they
consisted chiefly of gentlemen, who had behaved with great valour in many
desperate actions in Italy, were, on sight of the enemy, seized with so
unaccountable a panic, that they immediately took to flight, and were pursued
by the English. The duke of Longueville, who commanded the French, Bussi
d'Amboise, Clermont, Im∣bercourt, the chevalier Bayard, and many other
officers of distinction were taken prisoners<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Memoires de Bellai▪ liv. 1. Polydore Virgil, lib. 27.
Hollingshed, p. 822. Herbert.</NOTE>. This action, or rather rout, is
sometimes called the battle of Guinegate, from the place where it was fought;
but more commonly the <HI>battle of Spurs,</HI> because the French, that day,
made more use of their spurs than of their swords or military
weapons.</P>
<P>AFTER so considerable an advantage, the King, who was at the
head of a compleat army of above 50,000 men, might have made incursions to
the gates of Paris, and spread confusion and desolation every where. It
gave Lewis great joy, when he heard, that the English, instead of pushing
their victory, and at∣tacking the dismayed troops of France, returned to the
siege of an inconsiderable place like Teroüane. The governors were
obliged soon after to surrender the town; and Henry found his acquisition
of so little consequence, tho' gained at the expence of some blood, and
what, in his present circumstances, was more important, of much valuable
time, that he immediately demolished the fortifi∣cations. <PB N="90" REF="95"/> The anxieties of the French were again renewed with regard to the
motions of the English. The Swiss at the same time had entered Burgundy
with a very formidable army, and laid siege to Dijon, which was in no
condition to resist them. Ferdinand himself, tho' he had made a truce
with Lewis, seemed disposed to lay hold of every advantage which fortune
should present to him. Scarce ever was the French monarchy in greater
danger, or less in a condition to defend itself against those powerful
armies, which on every side assailed or threatened it. Even many of the
inhabitants of Paris, who believed themselves exposed to the rapacity and
violence of the enemy, began to dislodge, without knowing what place could
afford them greater safety and protection.</P>
<P>BUT Lewis was extricated from his present difficulties by the
manifest blunders of his enemies. The Swiss allowed themselves to be
seduced into a negotiation by Tremoüille, governor of Burgundy; and
without making enquiry, whether he had any powers to treat, they accepted of
the conditions which he offered them. Tremoüille, who knew, that he would
be disavowed by his master, stipulated whatever they were pleased to
demand; and thought himself happy, at the expence of some payments, and
very large promises, to get rid of so for∣midable an enemy<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Memoires du mareschal de Fleuranges Beliarius, lib.
14.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE measures of Henry showed equal ignorance in the art of
war with those of the Swiss in negotiation. Tournay was a great and rich
city, which, tho' it lay within the frontiers of Flanders, belonged entirely to
France, and afforded the troops of that kingdom a passage into the middle
of the Netherlands. Maximi∣lian, who was desirous to free his grandson from
so troublesome a neighbourhood, advised Henry to lay siege to this
place; and the English monarch, not con∣sidering that such an
acquisition no way advanced his conquests in France, was so imprudent as
to follow this interested council. The city of Tournay, by its an∣tient
charters, being exempted from the burthen of a garrison, the burghers, even
against the remonstrance of their sovereign, strenuously insisted
on maintain∣ing this dangerous privilege; and they engaged, by themselves, to
make a vigo∣rous defence against the enemy<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Memoires
de Fleuranges.</NOTE>. Their courage failed them when matters came to
extremity; 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">24th Septem∣ber.</NOTE> and after a few days
siege, the place was surrendered to the Eng∣lish. Henry so little
regarded its privileges, that he immediately quartered a garrison in it,
under the command of Sir Edward Poinings. The bishop of Tournay was lately
dead; and as a new bishop was already elected by the chapter, but not
installed in his office, the King bestowed the administration of the
see on his favourite, Wolsey, and put him in immediate possession
of the <PB N="91" REF="96"/> revenues, which were considerable<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Strype's Memorials, vol. 1. p. 5, 6.</NOTE>. Hearing
of the retreat of the Swiss, and observing the season to be far
advanced, he thought proper to retire into Eng∣land; and he carried the
greatest part of his army with him. Success had at∣tended him in every
enterprize; and his youthful mind was much elated with this seeming
prosperity; but all men of judgment, comparing the advantages of his
situation with his progress, his expences with his acquisitions, were
convinced, that this campaign, so much vaunted, was, in reality, both ruinous
and in∣glorious<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Cuicciardini.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE success, which, during this summer, had attended
Henry's arms in the north, was much more decisive. The King of Scotland had
summoned out the whole force of his kingdom; and having passed the Tweed
with a brave, tho' a tumultuary army of above 50,000 men, he ravaged those
parts of Northum∣berland which lay nearest that river, and employed himself
in taking the castles of Norham, Etal, Werke, Ford, and other places of
little importance. The lady Ford, a woman of great beauty, being taken
prisoner in her castle, was presented to James, and so gained on the
affections of that monarch, that he wasted in idle pleasure that critical
time, which, during the absence of his enemy, he should have employed in
pushing his conquests. His troops, lying in a barren country, where they
soon consumed all the provisions, began to be pinched with necessity;
and as the authority of the prince was feeble, and mili∣tary discipline,
during that age, extremely relaxed, many of them had stolen from the camp,
and retired to their houses. Mean while, the earl of Surrey, having collected
a force of 26,000 men, of which 5000 had been sent over from the King's army
in France, marched to the defence of the country, and approached the Scotch,
who lay on some high ground near the hills of Cheviot. The river Till ran
between the armies, and prevented an engagement: Surrey therefore sent a
herald to the Scotch camp, challenging them to descend into the plain of
Milfield, which lay towards the south; and there, appointing a day for the
combat, try their valour on equal ground. As he received no satisfactory
an∣swer, he made a feint of marching towards Berwic; as if he intended to
enter Scotland, to lay waste the borders, and cut off the provisions of the
enemy. The Scotch army, in order to prevent his purpose, put themselves in
motion; and having set fire to the huts in which they had quartered, they
descended from the hills. Surrey, taking advantage of the smoke, which was
blown towards him, and which covered his movements, passed the Till with
his artillery and vanguard at the bridge of Twisel, and sent the rest of
his army to find a sord farther up the river.</P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="97"/> AN engagement was now become inevitable

<NOTE PLACE="marg">9th Septem∣ber.</NOTE> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Battle of Flou∣den.</NOTE> The English
divided their army into two lines: Lord Howard led the main body of the
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>st line, Sir Edmond Howard the
right wing, Sir Marmaduke Constable the left. The earl of Surrey himself
commanded the main body of the second line, lord Dacres the right wing, Sir
Edward Stanley the left. The Scotch front presented three divisions to the
enemy: The middle was led by the King himself: The right by the earl of
Huntley, assisted by lord Hume: The left by the earls of Lenox and
Argyle. A fourth division under the earl of Bothwel made a body of
re∣serve. Huntley began the battle; and after a sharp conflict, put to
flight the left wing of the English, and chaced them off the field: But on
returning from the pursuit, he found the whole Scotch army in great
disorder. The division under Lenox and Argyle, elated with the success
of the other wing, had broke their ranks, and notwithstanding the
remonstrances and entreaties of La Motte, the French ambassador, had
rushed headlong upon the enemy. Not only Sir Edmond Howard, at the head of
his division, received them with great valour; but Dacres, who commanded in
the second line, wheeling about during the action, fell upon their rear, and
put them to the sword without resistance. The division under the King
himself and that under Bothwel, animated by the valour of their leaders,
still made head against the English, and throwing themselves into a
circle, protracted the action till night separated the combatants. The
victory seemed yet uncertain, and the numbers which fell on each side were
nearly equal, amounting to above 5000 men: But the morning discovered
evi∣dently where the advantage lay. The English had lost only persons of
small note; but the flower of the Scotch nobility had fallen in battle, and
the King himself, after the most diligent enquiry, could no where be found.
In searching the field, the English met with a dead body, which resembled
him, and was arrayed in a similar habit; and they put it in a lead coffin and
sent it to London. Dur∣ing some time it was kept unburied; because James
died under sentence of ex∣communication, on account of his confederacy with
France, and his opposition to the holy see<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Buchannan, lib. 13. Herbert.</NOTE>: But upon Henry's application,
who pretended that that prince, in the instant before his death, had
discovered signs of repentance, absolution was given him, and his body
was interred. The Scotch, however, still asserted, that it was not
James's body, which was found in the field of battle, but that of one
Elphinston, who had been arrayed in arms resembling the King's, in or∣der
to divide the attention of the English, and share the danger with his
master. <PB N="93" REF="98"/> It was believed that James had been seen
crossing the Tweed at Kelso; and some imagined that he had been killed
by the clients of lord Hume, whom that noble∣man had instigated to commit
so enormous a crime. But the populace enter∣tained the opinion, that he was
still alive, and having gone secretly in pilgrimage to the holy land, would
soon return, and take possession of the throne. This fond conceit was
long entertained in Scotland.</P>
<P>THE King of Soots and most of the chief nobility being killed
in the field of Flouden, so this battle was called, a very inviting
opportunity was offered to Henry of gaining advantages over that kingdom,
perhaps of reducing it to subjection. But he discovered on this occasion
a mind truly great and generous. When the queen of Scotland, Margaret, who was
created regent during the infancy of her son, applied for peace, he readily
granted it; and took compassion of the helpless condition of his
sister and nephew. <MILESTONE N="1514" UNIT="year"/> The earl of Surrey,
who had gained him so great a victory, he restored to the title of Duke of
Norfolk, which had been forfeited by his father, for engaging on the side of
Richard the third. His son, lord Howard, was honoured with the title of earl
of Surrey. Sir Charles Brandon, his favourite, whom he had before created
viscount Lisle, was now raised to the dignity of duke of Suffolk.
Wolsey, who was both his favourite and his minister, was created bishop
of Lincoln. Lord Herbert ob∣tained the title of earl of Worcester. Sir Edward
Stanley, that of lord Mont∣eagle.</P>
<P>THO' peace with Scotland gave Henry security towards the
north, and enabled him to prosecute in tranquility his enterprize against
France, some other inci∣dents had happened, which more than counterballanced
this fortunate event, and served to open his eyes with regard to the
rashness of an undertaking, into which his youth and high fortune had
betrayed him.</P>
<P>LEWIS, fully sensible of the dangerous situation to which
his kingdom had been reduced during the former campaign, was resolved, by
every expedient, to prevent the return of like perils, and to break the
confederacy of his enemies. The pope was no way disposed to push the
French to extremity; and provided they returned not to take possession
of Milan, his interest rather led him to pre∣serve the ballance among the
contending parties. He accepted therefore of Lewis's offer to renounce the
council of Lyons; and he took off the excommu∣nication which his
predecessor and himself had denounced against that King and his
kingdom. Ferdinand was now fast declining in years, and as he entertained no
farther ambition than that of keeping possession of Navarre, which he
had subdued by his arms and policy, he readily hearkened to the proposals
of Lewis for prolonging the truce another year; and he even showed an
inclination of <PB N="94" REF="99"/> forming a more intimate connexion with that
monarch. Lewis had dro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t hints of
his intention to marry his second daughter, Renée, either to Charles,
prince of Spain, or his brother, Ferdinand, both of them grandchildren to the
Spanish monarch; and he declared his resolution of bestowing on her, as
her portion, his claim to the dutchy of Milan. Ferdinand not only embraced
these schemes with avidity; but also engaged the emperor, Maximilian, in
the same views, and procured his consent to a treaty, which opened so
inviting a prospect of aggran∣dizing their common grandchildren.</P>
<P>WHEN Henry was informed of Ferdinand's renewal of the truce with
Lewis, he fell into the most violent rage, and loudly complained, that his
father-in-law had first, by the highest promises and professions,
engaged him in enmity with France, and afterwards, without giving him the
least warning, had now again sacrificed his interest to his own
selfish purposes, and had left him exposed alone to all the dangers and
expences of the war. In proportion to his easy credulity and unsuspecting
reliance on Ferdinand, was the vehemence with which he ex∣claimed against the
treatment, which he met with; and he threatened revenge for this egregious
treachery and breach of Faith<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Petrus de Angleria,
Epis. 545, 546.</NOTE>. But he lost all patience when informed of the other
negotiation, where Maximilian was also seduced from his alliance, and where
proposals had been hearkened to, for the marriage of the prince of Spain with
the daughter of France. Charles, during the life-time of the late King, had
been affianced to Mary, Henry's second sister; and as the prince now
approached the age of puberty, the King had expected the immediate completion
of the marriage, and the honourable settlement of a fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>er, for whom he had entertained a very tender affection.
Such a complication, there∣fore, of injuries gave him the highest
displeasure, and inspired him with a desire of expressing his
disdain towards those who had taken advantage of his youth and
inexperience, and had abused his too great facility.</P>
<P>THE duke of Longueville, who had been made prisoner at the
battle of Guine∣gate, and who was still detained in England, was ready to
take advantage of all these dispositions of Henry, in order to procure a
peace and even an alliance, which he knew to be so passionately desired
by his master. He represented to the King, that Anne, queen of France,
being lately dead, a door was thereby opened for an affinity, which might tend
to the advantage of both kingdoms, and which would serve to terminate
honourably all the differences between them: That she had left Lewis no male
children; and as he had ever entertained a strong desire of having heirs to
the crown, no marriage seemed more suitable to him than that with the 
<PB N="95" REF="100"/> princess of England, whose youth and beauty afforded
the most flattering hopes in that particular: That tho' the marriage of a
princess of sixteen, with a King of fifty three, might seem unsuitable;
yet the other advantages, attending the alliance, were more than a sufficient
compensation for this inequality: And that Henry, in loosening his
connexions with Spain, whence he had never experienced any advantage, would
contract a close affinity with Lewis, a prince, who, thro' his whole life,
had invariably maintained the character of probity and honour.</P>
<P>AS Henry seemed to hearken to this discourse with very
willing ears, Longue∣ville informed his master of the probability, which he
discovered, of bringing this matter to a happy conclusion; and he received
full powers for negotiating the treaty. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Peace with France.</NOTE> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">7th of August.</NOTE> The articles were
easily adjusted between the monarchs. Lewis agreed that Tournay should
remain in the hands of the English; that Richard de la Pole should be
banished to Metz, there to live on a pension assigned him by Lewis;
that Henry should receive payment of a million of crowns, being the arrears
due by treaty to his father and himself; and that the princess Mary
should bring four hundred thousand crowns as her portion, and enjoy as
large a jointure as any queen of France, even the former, who was heiress of
Britanny. The two princes also stipulated the succours, with which they
should mutually supply each other, in case either of them was attacked by
any enemy<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Du Tillet.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">9th of Octo∣ber.</NOTE> IN consequence of
this treaty, Mary was sent over to France with a splendid retinue, and
Lewis met her at Abbeville, where the espousals were celebrated. He was
enchanted with the beauty, grace, and numerous accomplishments of the young
princess; and being naturally of an amorous disposition, which his
advanced age had not entirely cooled, he was seduced into such a course
of gaiety and plea∣sure, as proved very unsuitable to his declining state
of health<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Brantome Eloge de Louis XII.</NOTE>.
<MILESTONE N="1515" UNIT="year"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">1st of Janu∣ary.</NOTE> He died in less

<P>FRANCIS, duke of Angouleme, a youth of one and twenty, who had
married Lewis's eldest daughter, succeeded him on the throne; and by his
activity, valour, generosity, and other virtues, gave prognostics of a
happy and glorious reign. This young monarch had been extremely struck with
the charms of the English princess; and even during his predecessor's
life-time, had payed her such close attendance, as made some of his
friends apprehend that he had entertained views of gallantry towards her. But
being warned, that, by indulging himself in this passion, he might
readily exclude his own title to the throne, he fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bore all <PB N="96" REF="101"/> farther addresses;
and even watched the young dowages with a very careful eye during the first
months of her widowhood. Charles Brandon, duke of Suffolk, was at that time in
the court of France, the most comely personage of his time, and the most
accomplished in all the exercises, which were then thought to be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t a courtier and a soldier. He was
Henry's chief favourite; and that monarch had even once entertained thoughts of
marrying him to his sister, and had given indul∣gence to that mutual
passion, which took place between them. The queen asked Suffolk, whether
he had now the courage, without farther reflection, to espouse her; and
she told him, that her brother would more easily forgive him for not
asking his consent, than for acting contrary to his orders. Suffolk
declined not so inviting an offer; and the marriage was secretly compleated
at Paris. Francis, who was pleased with this marriage, as it prevented Henry
from forming any powerful alliance by means of his sister<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Petrus de Angleria, Epist. 544.</NOTE>, interposed his good
offices in appealing him: And even Wolsey, having entertained no jealousy
of Suffolk, who was content to participate in the King's pleasures, and had
no ambition to interpose in state affairs, was active in reconciling the
King to his sister and brother-in-law; and he obtained them permission
to return to England.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Wolsey's ad∣ministration.</NOTE> THE
numerous enemies, whom Wolsey's sudden elevation, his aspiring character,
and his haughty deportment had raised, served only to rivet him faster in
Henry's confidence; who placed a pride in supporting the choice, which he had
made, and who was incapable of yielding either to the murmurs of the people or
the discontents of the great. That artful prelate likewise, well 
<PB N="97" REF="102"/> acquanted with the King's imperious temper, concealed
from him the absolute ascendant, which he acquired; and while he secretly
directed all public councils, he ever pretended a blind submission to the
will and authority of his master. By entering into the King's pleasures, he
still preserved his affections; by conducting his business, he
gratified his indolence; and by his unlimited complaisance in both
capacities, he prevented all that jealousy, to which his exorbitant
acquisi∣tions, and his splendid, ostentatious train of life should
naturally have given birth. The archbishoprick of York falling vacant by the
death of Bambrige, Wolsey was promoted to that see, and resigned the
bishoprick of Lincoln. Besides en∣joying the administration of Tournay,
he got possession, at very low leases, of the revenues of Bath,
Worcester, and Hereford, bishopricks filled by Italians, who were allowed
to reside abroad, and who were glad to compound for this in∣dulgence, by
parting with a considerable share of their profits. He held in com∣mendam
the abbey of St. Albans, and many other church preferments. He was even allowed
to unite with the see of York, first that of Durham, next that of
Winchester; and there seemed to be no end of his acquisitions. His
advance∣ment in ecclesiastical dignity served him as a pretence for
engrossing still more revenues: The pope, observing his great influence
over the King, was desirous of engaging him in his interest, and had
created him a cardinal. Never church∣man, under colour of exacting regard to
religion, carried to a more exorbitant height, the state and dignity of that
character. His train consisted of eight hun∣dred servants, of whom many
were knights and gentlemen: Some even of the nobility put their children into
his family as a place of education; and in order to ingratiate them with their
patron, allowed them to bear offices as his servants. Whoever was
distinguished by any art or science payed court to the cardinal; and none
payed court in vain. Literature, which was then in its infancy, found in him a
generous patron; and both by his public institutions and private bounty, he
gave encouragement to every branch of erudition<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Erasm. Epist lib. 2. Epist. 1. lib. 16. Epist. 3.</NOTE>.
Not content with this munificence, which gained him the approbation of the
wise, he strove to dazzle the eyes of the populace, by the splendour of
his equipage and furniture, the costly embroidery of his liveries, the
lustre of his apparel. He was the first cler∣gyman in England who wore
silk and gold, not only on his habit, but also on his saddles and the
trappings of his horses<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Polydore Virgil, lib.
27. Stowe, p. 501. Holligshed, p. 847.</NOTE>. He caused his cardinal's hat
to be borne aloft by a person of rank; and when he came to the King's chapel,
would permit it to be laid on no place but the altar. A priest, the tallest
and most comely <PB N="98" REF="103"/> he could find, carried before him a
pillar of silver, on whose top was placed a cross: But not content with
this parade, to which he thought himself intitled as cardinal, he provided
another priest of equal stature and beauty, who marched along, bearing the
cross of York, even in the diocese of Canterbury; contrary to the antient
rule and agreement between the prelates of these rival sees.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Polydore Virgil, lib. 27.</NOTE>. The people made merry with the
cardinal's ostentation; and said they were now sen∣sible, that one
cross alone was not sufficient for the expiation of his sins and
offences.</P>
<P>WARHAM, chancellor and archbishop of Canterbury, a man of a
very mode∣rate temper, averse to all dispute, chose rather to retire from
public employment, than maintain an unequal contest with the haughty
cardinal. He resigned his office of chancellor; and the seals were
immediately intrusted to Wolsey. If this new accumulation of dignity
encreased his enemies, it also served to exalt his per∣sonal character,
and prove the extent of his capacity. A strict administration of justice
took place during his enjoyment of this high office; and no chancellor ever
discovered greater impartiality in his decisions, deeper penetration of
judg∣ment, or more enlarged knowledge of law and equity<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Sir Thomas More. Stowe, p. 504.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE duke of Norfolk, finding the King's money almost all
exhausted by projects and pleasures, while his inclination for expence
still continued, was glad to resign his office of treasurer, and retire
from court. His rival, Fox, bishop of Winchester, profited not by his
absence; but partly overcome by years and infir∣mities, partly disgusted
at the ascendant acquired by Wolsey, withdrew himself entirely to the
care of his diocese. The duke of Suffolk had also taken offence, that the
King, by the cardinal's perswasion, had refused to pay a debt, which he
had contracted during his abode in France; and he thenceforth affected to live
in privacy. These incidents left Wolsey to enjoy without a rival the whole
power and favour of the King; and put into his hands every species of
authority. In vain, did Fox, before his retirement, warn the King 
<Q REND="inline">"not to suffer the servant to be greater
than his master:"</Q> Henry replied, 
<Q REND="inline">"that he knew well how to retain all his
subjects in obedience;"</Q> but he continued still an unlimited defe∣rence
in every thing to the directions and counsels of the cardinal.</P>
<P>THE public tranquillity was so well established in
England, the obedience of the people so entire, the general administration
of justice, by the cardinal's means<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Eras<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. lib. 2.

remarkable as to disturb the repose of the King and his minister: They
might even have dispensed <PB N="96" REF="104"/> with themselves from
giving any strict attention to foreign affairs, were it possible for men
to enjoy any situation in absolute tranquillity, or abstain from projects
and enterprizes, however fruitless and unnecessary.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Scotch affairs.</NOTE> THE will of the late
King of Scotland, who left his widow regent of the Kingdom, and the vote of the
convention of Estates, which confirmed that desti∣nation, had expressly
limited her authority to the condition of her remaining un∣married<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bachanan, lib. 14. D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ummond. Herbert.</NOTE>: But notwithstanding this limitation, a
few months after her husband's death, she espoused the earl of Angus,
of the name of Douglas, a nobleman of great family and very promising hopes.
Some of the nobility now proposed the election of Angus as regent, and
recommended this choice as the most likely means of preserving peace with
England: But the jealousy of the great families, and the fear of exalting the
Douglasses, begot opposition to this measure. Lord Hume in particular,
the most powerful chieftain in the kingdom, insisted on re∣calling the
duke of Albany, son to a brother of James the third, who had been banished
into France, and who, having there married, had lest posterity, that were
the next heirs to the crown, and the nearest relations to their young
sovereign. Albany, though first prince of the blood, had never been in
Scotland, was totally unacquainted with the manners of the people, ignorant of
their situation, unprac∣ticed in their language; yet such was the favour
attending the French alliance, and so great the authority of Hume, that this
prince was invited to accept the reins of government. Francis, careful not to
give offence to the King of England, detained Albany some time in France; but
at last, sensible how im∣portant it was to keep Scotland in his
interests, he permitted him to go over, and take possession of the
regency: He even renewed the antient league with that kingdom, tho' it implied
such a close connexion, as might be thought somewhat to infringe his
alliance with England.</P>
<P>WHEN the regent arrived in Scotland, he made enquiries
concerning the state of the country, and character of the people; and
discovered a scene, with which he was hitherto but little acquainted. That
turbulent kingdom, he found, was rather to be considered as a confederacy,
and that not a close one, of petty princes, than a regular system of
civil polity; and even the King, much more the regent, possest an
authority very uncertain and precarious. Arms, more than laws, prevailed; and
courage, preserably to equity or justice, was the virtue most valued and
respected. The nobility, in whom the whole power resided, were so
connected by hereditary alliances, or so divided by inveterate enmiti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, that it was impossible, without
employing force, either to punish the most
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>grant guilt, or give security to
the most entire innocence. Rapine and violence, when <PB N="100" REF="105"/>
exercised on a hostile tribe, instead of making a person▪ odious
among hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> own clan, rather
recommended him to esteem and approbation, and by rendering him useful to
the chieftain, entitled him to a preference above his fellows. And tho' the
necessity of mutual support served as a close cement of friendship
among those of the same kindred, the spirit of revenge against enemies,
and the desire of pros<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣cuting
the deadly feuds, (so they were called) still appeared to be passions
the most predominant among that uncultivated people.</P>
<P>THE persons, to whom Albany first applied for information
with regard to the state of the country, happened to be inveterate enemies of
Hume<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Buchanan, lib. 14. Drummond.</NOTE>; and they
represented that powerful nobleman as the chief source of public
disorders, and the great obstacle to the execution of the laws, and
administration of justice. Before the authority of the magistrate could
be established, it was necessary, they said, to make an example of
this great offender; and by the terror of his punish∣ment, teach all
lesser criminals to pay respect to the power of their sovereign.
Albany, moved by these reasons, was induced to forget Hume's past
services, to which he had been, in a great measure, beholden for the
regency; and he no longer bore towards him that favourable countenance, with
which he was wont to receive him. Hume perceived the change, and was incited,
both by views of his own security and his revenge, to take measures in
opposition to the regent. He applied himself to Angus and the queen
dowager, and represented to them the danger to which the infant prince was
exposed, from the ambition of Albany, the next heir to the crown, to whom the
states had imprudently entrusted the whole authority of government. By his
perswasion, she formed the design of carrying off the young King, and
putting him under the protection of her bro∣ther; and when that conspiracy
was discovered, she herself, accompanied with Hume and Angus, withdrew
into England, where she was soon after delivered of a daughter.</P>
<P>HENRY, in order to check the authority of Albany and the French
party, gave encouragement to these malecontents, and assured them of his
protection. Matters being afterwards in appearance accommodated between Hume
and the regent, that nobleman returned into his own country; but mutual
suspicions and jealousies still prevailed. He was committed to
custody, under the care of the earl of Arran, his brother-in-law; and was,
for some time, detained prisoner in his castle. But having perswaded
Arran to enter into the conspiracy with him, he was allowed to make his
escape; and he openly made war upon the regent. A new accommodation ensued,
no more sincere than the foregoing; and Hume was so imprudent as to put
himself, together with his brother, into the hands of <PB N="101" REF="106"/>
the regent. They were immediately seized, committed to custody, brought to
their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>al, condemned, and executed.
No legal crime was proved against these brothers: It was only alleged,
that, at the battle of Flouden, they had not done their duty in supporting
the King; and as this backwardness could not, from the whole course of
their past life, be ascribed to cowardice, it was com∣monly imputed to a
more criminal motive. The evidences, however, of guilt produced against them,
were far from being valid or convincing; and the people, who hated them while
alive, were very much dissatisfied with their execution.</P>
<P>SUCH violent remedies often produce, for some time, a
deceitful tranquillity; but as they destroy mutual confidence, and beget the
most inveterate animosities, their consequences are commonly very satal
both to the public, and to those who make trial of them. The regent, however,
took advantage of the present calm which prevailed; and being invited by the
French king, who was, at that time, willing to gratify Henry, he went over into
France; and was detained there during five years. A great part of his authority
he entrusted into the hands of Darcy, a Frenchman, whom he created warden of
the marches, and who was extremely vigilant in the distribution of justice,
and the punishment of crimes and oppression. But Sir David Hume, a
kinsman of the nobleman lately executed, desirous of revenging his friend's
death on the friend of the regent, way-laid Darcy near Dunse; and after
reproaching him with that execution, made an attack upon him. Darcy finding
himself too weak to resist, and trusting to the swiftness of his
horse, fled towards Dunbar; but being ignorant of the roads, he ran into a
bog, was overtaken by the pursuers, and put to death. As he wore long flowing
hair, Hume, exulting in this assassination as a gallant exploit, cut
out these locks, and pleating them into a wreath, wore them ever after at the
pummel of his saddle<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Buchanan, lib. 14.
Pitscotti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE>. During the
absence of the regent, such confusions pre∣vailed in Scotland, and such
mutual enmity, rapine, and violence, among the great families, that that
kingdom was, for a long time, utterly disabled both from offending its
enemies, and assisting its friends. We have carried on the Scotch
history some years b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>yond the
present period; that as that country had little con∣nexion with the general
system of Europe, we might be the less interrupted in the narration of
those memorable events, which were there transacted.</P>
<P>IT was soreseen, that a young, active prince, like Francis,
and of so m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rtial a
disposition, would not suffer to lie useless the great preparations,
which his prede∣cessor, before his death, had made for the conquest of
Milan. He had been observed even to weep at the recital of the military
exploits of G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ston de Foix; 
<PB N="102" REF="107"/> and these tears of emulation were held to be sure
prognostics of his future valour. He renewed the treaty which Lewis had made
with Henry; and having left every thing, as he thought, secure behind him, he
marched his armies towards the south of France; pretending, that his sole
purpose was to secure his kingdom against the incursions of the
Swiss. That formidable people still retained their animosity against
France; and having taken Maximilian, duke of Milan, under their protection, and
indeed reduced him to absolute dependance, they were de∣termined, from views
both of honour and interest, to defend him against his in∣vader<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Memoires du

12.</NOTE>. They fortified themselves with numerous forces in all those
vallies of the Alps, thro' which, they thought, the French must
necessarily pass; 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Progress of Francis the first.</NOTE> and
when Francis, with great secrecy, industry, and perseverance, made his
entrance into Piemont by another passage, they were not dismayed, but
descended into the plain, tho' unprovided of cavalry, and opposed
themselves to the progress of the French arms. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">13th Sep∣tember.</NOTE> At Marignan near
Milan, they fought with Francis one of the most furious and best
contested battles, which is to be met with in the history of these latter
ages; and it required all the heroic valour of that prince to inspire his
troops with courage sufficient to resist the desperate assault of
those mountainers. After a bloody action in the evening, night and darkness
parted the combatants; but next morning, the Swiss renewed the attack with
equal alacrity; and it was not till they had lost all their bravest troops
that they could be prevailed with to retire. The field was strowed with
twenty thousand slain of both sides; and the mareschal Trivulzio, who
had been present at eighteen pitched battles, declared that every engagement,
which he had yet seen, was only the play of children, but that the action of
Marignan was a combat of heroes<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> de la L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gue de Cambr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y</NOTE>.</P>
<P>AFTER this great victory, the conquest of the Milaneze was
easy and open. Francis, sensible how important the alliance of the
cantons was, even in their lowest fortune, gave them all the conditions,
which they could have demanded, had they been ever so successful; and he
courted their friendship by every pos∣sible condescension. The
Venetians were in alliance with France; and as they trusted entirely to the
successes of that crown for the final recovery of their do∣minions on the
continent, they seconded Francis in every enterprize. Pope Leo, whose
sole fault was too great finesse and artifice, a fault, which, both as a
priest and an Italian, it was difficult for him to avoid, had hitherto
temporized be∣tween the parties; and Francis's victory at Marignan determined
him absolutely to embrace the friendship of that monarch<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Gui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cciardini, lib.
12. Paullus Jovius.</NOTE>. But what both facilitated most, 
<PB N="103" REF="108"/> and secured the conquest of the Milaneze, was the
resolution of Maximilian Sforza himself, who, tired of the vicissitudes
of his fortune, disgusted with the tyranny of the Swiss, and desirous
of privacy and repose, put himself into Francis's hands; and having
stipulated a yearly pension of thirty thousand ducats, resigned all
pretensions to that dutchy, and retired into France.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Jealousy of Henry.</NOTE> THE success
and glory of the French monarch began to excite jealousy in Henry; and his
rapid progress, tho' in so distant a country, was not regarded without
apprehensions by the English ministry. Italy was during that age the
seat of religion, of literature, and of commerce; and as it possessed
alone that lustre, which has since been shared among other nations, it
fixed the attention of all Europe, and every acquisition which was made
there, appeared more impor∣tant than its weight in the ballance of power
should, strictly speaking, have de∣manded. Henry also thought, that he
had reason to complain of Franc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s
for sending the duke of Albany into Scotland, and undermining the power and
credit of his sister, the queen dowager<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Pere
Daniel, vol. 3. p. 31.</NOTE>. The repairing the fortifications of
Te∣roüenne was also regarded as a breach of treaty. But above all, what
tended to alienate the court of England, was the disgust which Wolsey had
taken against the French monarch.</P>
<P>HENRY, on the conquest of Tournay, had refused to admit
Lewis Gaillart, the bishop elect, to the possession of the
temporalities, because that prelate de∣clined taking the oath of allegiance
to his new sovereign; and Wolsey was appointed, in his room,
administrator of the bishoprick. As the cardinal wished to obtain free
and undisturbed possession, he applied to Francis, and desired him
to bestow on Gaillart some see of equal value in France, and to obtain
his resignation of Tournay. Francis, who still hoped to recover
possession of that city, and who feared that the full settlement of
Wolsey in the bishopric would prove an obstacle to his purpose, had
hitherto neglected to gratify the haughty prelate; and the bishop of Tournay,
by applying to the court of Rome, had obtained a bull for his settlement in
that see. Wolsey, who expected to be com∣plied with in every request, and
who exacted respect even from the greatest monarchs, resented the
slight put upon him by Francis; and he pushed his master to seek an
occasion for wreaking his vengeance against that monarch<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Polydore Virgil, lib. 27.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>MAXIMILIAN the emperor was ready to embrace every proposal of
a new en∣terprize, especially if attended with an offer of money, of which he
was ex∣tremely greedy, extremely prodigal, and extremely necessitous.
Richard Pace, formerly secretary to cardinal Bambrige, now secretary of
state, was dispatched <PB N="104" REF="109"/>
<MILESTONE N="1516" UNIT="year"/> to the court of Vienna, and had a
commission to propose some considerable payments to Maximilian<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Petrus de Angleria, epist. 568.</NOTE>: He thence made a journey
into Switzerland; and by like motives engaged some of the cantons to
furnish troops to the emperor. That prince invaded Italy with a
considerable army; but being repulsed from before Milan, he retreated with
his army into Germany, made peace with France and Venice, delivered Verona to
that republic for a sum of money, and thus excluded himself, in some
measure, from all future access into Italy. And Henry found, that, after
expending five or six hundred thousand ducats, in order to gratify the
cardinal's resentment, he had only loosened his alliance with Francis,
without diminishing the power of that prince.</P>
<P>THERE were many reasons, which engaged the King not to proceed
farther at present in his enmity against France. He could hope for
assistance from no power in Europe. Ferdinand, his father in law, who had
often deceived him, was now declining fast from age and infirmities; and a
speedy end was looked for to the long and prosperous reign of that great
monarch. Charles, prince of Spain, sovereign of the Low Countries, desired
nothing but peace with Francis, who had it so much in his power, if provoked,
to obstruct his peaceable accession to that rich inheritance, which was
waiting him. The pope was overawed by the power of France, and Venice was
engaged in a close alliance with that mo∣narchy<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Guicciardini, lib. 12.</NOTE>. Henry therefore remained in
tranquillity during some time; and seemed to give himself no concern with
regard to the affairs of the continent. In vain did Maximilian endeavour to
allure him into some expence, by offering to make a resignation of the
imperial crown in his favour. That artifice was too gross to succeed even
with a prince so little political as Henry; and Pace, his envoy, who was
perfectly well acquainted with the emperors motives and cha∣racter, gave him
warning, that the sole view of that prince in making him so liberal an
offer, was to draw money from him.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">15th January.</NOTE> WHILE an universal
peace prevailed in Europe, that event happened, which had so long been looked
for, and from which such important consequences were expected, the death of
Ferdinand, the catholic, and the succession of his grand∣son, Charles,
to his extensive dominions. No commotion, however, or alte∣ration followed
immediately upon that great incident. This young prince, who had not yet
reached his sixteenth year, was already a great statesman, from the
excellent education which he had received, and from the mature and solid
judgment, with which nature had endowed him. He was sensible how im∣portant
it was to preserve peace with foreigners, till he should have
established <PB N="105" REF="110"/> his authority in his new dominions; and
finding Francis desirous to take ad∣vantage of his present situation, he
made him an offer of such terms as gained the friendship and alliance of
that monarch. He engaged to marry Francis's daughter, tho' only an infant of a
year old; to receive as her dowry all her father's pretensions on the kingdom
of Naples; to pay him a hundred thousand crowns a year, till the
consummation of the marriage; and to give the King of Navarre satisfaction
with regard to his dominions<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Recueil de Traités
par Leonard, tom. 2.</NOTE>. <MILESTONE N="1517" UNIT="year"/> Charles, having
finished this treaty at Noyon by his ministers, and having thus left every
thing in security in the Low Countries, departed for Spain, and was willingly
received to the government of these united kingdoms. The right of
succession lay in his mother, Joan, who was still alive; but as she
was usually dis∣ordered in her judgment, Ferdinand had left the
administration to his grandson, Charles; and the states, both of
Castile and Arragon, gave their consent to this destination.</P>
<P>THE more Charles advanced in power and authority, the more was
Francis sensible of the necessity he lay under of gaining the
confidence and friendship of Henry; and he took at last the only method by
which he could obtain success, the paying court, by presents and
flattery, to the haughty cardinal.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1518" UNIT="year"/> BONNIVET, admiral of France,
was dispatched to London, and he was di∣rected to employ all his
insinuation and address, qualities for which he was re∣markable, to procure
himself a place in Wolsey's good graces. After the am∣bassador had
succeeded in his purpose, he took an opportunity of expressing his
master's regret, that, by mistakes and misapprehensions, he had been
so un∣fortunate as to lose a friendship, which he so much valued as
that of his eminence. Wolsey was not deaf to these honourable advances from
so great a monarch; and he was thenceforth observed to express himself,
on all occasions, in favour of the French alliance. The more to engage him in
his interests, Francis entered into such confidence with him, that he
asked his advice even in his most secret affairs, and on all difficult
emergencies had recourse to him as to an oracle of wisdom and profound
policy. The cardinal made no secret to the King of this private
correspondence; and Henry was so prepossessed in favour of the
great capacity of his minister, that, he said, he verily believed he would
govern Francis as well as himself<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Polydore
Virgil, lib. 27.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WHEN matters seemed sufficiently prepared, Bonnivet opened
to the cardinal his master's desire of recovering Tournay; and Wolsey
immediately, without hesitation, engaged to effectuate his purpose. He took
an opportunity of re∣presenting <PB N="106" REF="111"/> to the King and
council, that Tournay lay so remote from Calais, that it would be very
difficult, if not impossible, in case of a war, to keep the communication
open between those two places: That as it was situate on the frontiers both
of France and the Netherlands, it was exposed to the attacks of both these
powers, and must necessarily, either by force or famine, fall into the
hands of the first assailant: That even in time of peace, it could not be
preserved without a large garrison, to restrain the numerous and mutinous
inhabitants, ever discontented with the English government: And that the
possession of Tournay, as it was thus precarious and expensive, so
was it entirely useless, and gave little or no access to annoy, on
occasion, the dominions either of Charles or of Francis.</P>
<P>THESE reasons were of themselves very convincing, and were
sure of meeting with no opposition, when they came from the mouth of the
cardinal. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tournay de∣livered to France.</NOTE> A treaty
there∣fore was entered into for the delivering up of Tournay; and in order to
give to that measure a more graceful appearance, it was agreed, that the
Dauphin and the princess Mary, both of them infants, should be betrothed,
and that this city should be considered as the dowry of the princess.
Such kinds of agreement were then common among sovereigns, tho' it was very
rare, that the interests and views of the parties continued so steady as
to render the intended marriages effectual. But as Henry had been at
considerable expence in building a citadel at Tournay, Francis agreed to pay
him 600,000 crowns at twelve yearly pay∣ments, and to put into his hands eight
hostages, all of them men of quality, for the performance of the article<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Memoires du Bellay, liv. 1.</NOTE>. And lest the cardinal
should think himself neglected in these stipulations, he promised him
a yearly pension of twelve thou∣sand livres, as an equivalent for his
administration of the bishopric of Tournay. He also engaged to recall
Albany from Scotland.</P>
<P>FRANCIS having succeeded so well in this negotiation, began
to enlarge his views, and to hope for more considerable advantages, by
practising on the vanity and self conceit of this haughty favourite. He
redoubled his flatteries to the cardinal, consulted him more frequently in
every doubt or difficulty, called him in each letter, <HI>father, tutor,
governor,</HI> and professed the most unbounded deference to his advice
and opinion. All those caresses were preparatives to a negotiation for
the delivery of Calais, in consideration of a sum of money to be paid for
it; and if we may credit Polydore Virgil, who bears a particular spite to
Wolsey, on ac∣count of his being dispossessed of his employment and
thrown into prison by that minister, so extravagant a proposal met with
a very favourable reception from the cardinal. He ventured not, however, to lay
the matter before the council: <PB N="107" REF="112"/> He was contented to
sound privately the opinions of men, by dropping hints in conversation, as
if he thought Calais a useless burthen to the kingdom<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Polydore Virgil, lib. 27.</NOTE>: But when he found, that all men
were strongly riveted in a contrary perswasion, he thought it dangerous
to proceed any farther in his purpose; and falling, soon after, into new
attachments with the King of Spain, the great friendship between Francis and
him began gradually to decline.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Wolsey ap∣pointed le∣gate.</NOTE> THE
enormous pride of Wolsey was now farther encreased by a great accession
of dignity and power which he had received. Cardinal Campeggio had been sent
as legate into England, in order to procure a tythe from the clergy, for
enabling the pope to oppose the progress of the Turks; a danger which was
real, and was formidable to all christendom, but which had been so often
made use of to serve the interested purposes of the court of Rome, that
it had lost all influence on the minds of the people. The Clergy refused to
comply with Leo's demand: Campeggio was recalled; and the King desired of the
pope, that Wolsey, who had been joined in this commission, might alone be
invested with the legantine power, together with the right of visit∣ing all
the clergy and monasteries, and even with suspending the whole laws of
the church during a twelve month. Wolsey, having obtained this new dig∣nity,
made a new display of that state and parade, to which he was so much
addicted. On solemn feast-days, he was not contented without saying
mass after the manner of the pope himself: Not only he had bishops and
abbots to serve him; he even engaged the first nobility to give him water
and the towel. He affected a rank superior to what had ever been claimed by
any churchman in England. Warham, the primate, having wrote him a letter, where
he sub∣scribed himself, <HI>your loving brother,</HI> Wolsey complained
of his presumption, in thus challenging an equality with him. When Warham was
told what offence he had given, he made light of the matter. 
<Q REND="inline">"Know ye not," he said, "that this man is
drunk with too much prosperity."</Q></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">His manner of
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that office.</NOTE> BUT
Wolsey carried the matter much farther than vain pomp and ostentation. He
erected an office, which he called the legantine court; and as he was now, by
means of the pope's commission and the King's favour, invested with all
power, both ecclesiastical and civil, no man knew what bounds were to be
set to the authority of this new tribunal. He conferred on it a species of
inquisitorial and censorial powers even over the laiety, and directed it to
examine into all matters of conscience; into all conduct which had given
scandal; into all actions, which, though they escaped the law, might appear
contrary to good morals. Offence was justly taken at this commission,
which was really unbounded; and <PB N="108" REF="113"/> the people were the more
disg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ted, when they saw a man,
who ind<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ged himself in the
licences of pleasure, so severe in repressing the least appearance
of immo∣rality in others. But to render his court more obnoxious, Wolsey made
one John Allen the judge in it, a person of scandalous life<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Strype's Memorials, vol. 1. p. 125.</NOTE>, whom he himself, as
chancellor, had condemned for perjury: And as this man either exacted fines
from every one whom he was pleased to find guilty, or took bribes to drop
pro∣secutions, men concluded, and with some appearance of reason, that he
shared with the cardinal these wages of iniquity. The clergy, and in
particular the monks, were exposed to this tyranny; and as the libertinism
of their lives often gave a just handle against them, they were obliged to
buy an indemnity, by paying large sums of money to the legate or his judge.
Not contented with this authority, Wolsey pretended, by virtue of his
commission, to assume the power of all the bishops courts;
particularly that of judging of Wills and Testaments; and his decisions in
these important points were esteemed not a little arbitrary. As if he
himself were pope, and as if the pope could dispose absolutely of every
ecclesiastical establishment, he presented to whatever priories or
benefices he pleased, without regard to the right of election in the monks,
or of patronage in the nobility and gentry<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Polydore Virgil, lib. 27. This whole narration has been copied by
all the historians from the author here cited: There are many
circumstances, however, very suspicious, both because of the ob∣vious
partiality of the historian, and because the parliament, when they
afterwards examined Wolsey's conduct, could find no proof for any material
crime he had committed.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>NO one durst carry to the King any complaint against these
usurpations of Wolsey, till Warham ventured to inform him of the
discontents of his people. Henry professed his ignorance of the whole
matter. 
<Q REND="inline">"A man," said he, "is not so blind any where
as in his own house: But do you, father," added he to the primate, "go to
Wolsey, and tell him, if any thing be amiss, that he amend it."</Q> A
reproof of this kind was not likely to be effectual: It only served to
augment Wolsey's enmity to Warham: But one London having pro∣secuted Allen,
the legate's judge, in a court of law, and convicted him of mal∣versation and
iniquity, the clamour at last reached the King's ears, and he ex∣pressed
such displeasure to the cardinal as made him ever after more cautious in
exerting his authority<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">This year and the

<P><PB N="109" REF="114"/> <MILESTONE N="1519" UNIT="year"/> WHILE
Henry, indulging himself in pleasure and amusement, entrusted the
government of his kingdom to this imperious minister, an incident happened
abroad, which excited his attention. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">12th of Janu∣ary.</NOTE> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Death of the emperor Max∣imilian.</NOTE>
Maximilian the emperor died, a man, who, of himself, was indeed of little
consequence; but as his death left vacant the first station among
christian princes, it put all men's spirits into agitation, and proved a
kind of aera in the general system of Europe. The Kings of France and Spain
immediately declared themselves candidates for the imperial throne; and
employed every expedient of money or intrigue, which promised them
success in so great a point of ambition. Henry also was encouraged to
put in his preten∣sions; but his minister, Pace, who was dispatched to
the electors, found that he began to sollicit too late, and that the votes of
all these princes were already pre engaged either on the one side or the
other.</P>
<P>FRANCIS and Charles made profession from the beginning of
carrying on this rivalship with emulation, but without enmity; and Francis in
particular de∣clared, that his brother Charles and he were, fairly and openly,
suitors to the same mistress: The more fortunate, added he, will carry
her; and the other must rest contented<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Belcario,
lib. 16. Guicciardin, lib. 13.</NOTE>. But all men apprehended, that this
extreme moderation, however reasonable, would not be of long duration; and
that incidents would certainly occur to sharpen the minds of the candidates
against each other. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Charles, King of Spain, chosen
empe∣ror.</NOTE> It was Charles who at last prevailed, to the great
disappointment of the French monarch, who still continued in the belief,
that the majority of the electoral college was engaged in his favour. And as he
was some years superior in age to his rival, and, after his victory at
Marignan, and conquest of the Milanese, much superior in renown, he could
not suppress his indignation, at being thus, in the face of all mankind,
after long and anxious expectation, post-poned in so important a
pre∣tension. From this concurrence, as much as from opposition of
interest, arose that emulation between those two great monarchs, which,
while it kept their whole age in agitation, sets them in so remarkable a
contrast to each other: Both of them princes endowed with talents and
abilities; brave, aspiring, active, industrious; beloved by their
servants and subjects, dreaded by their enemies, and respected by all the
world: Francis, open, frank, liberal, munificent, car∣rying these virtues to
an excess which prejudiced his affairs: Charles, political, close,
artificial, frugal; better calculated to obtain success in wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s and in nego∣tiations, especially
the latter. The one, the more amiable man; the other, the greater monarch. The
King, from his oversights and indiscretions, naturally exposed to
misfortunes; but qualified, by his spirit and magnanimity, to extri∣cate
himself from them with honour: The emperor, by his designing, interested 
<PB N="110" REF="115"/> character, fitted, in his greatest successes to
excite jealousy and opposition even among his allies, and to rouze up a
multitude of enemies, in the place of one whom he had subdued. And as the
personal qualities of these princes thus counterpoised each other, so
did the advantages and disadvantages of their dominions. Fortune alone,
without the concurrence of prudence or valour, never reared up of a sudden
so great a power as that which centered in the emperor Charles. He reaped the
succession of Castile, of Arragon, of Austria, of Burgundy: He
inherited the conquest of Naples, of Granada: Election entitled him to the
empire: Even the bounds of the globe seemed to be enlarged a little before
his time, that he might possess the whole treasures, as yet entire and
unrifled, of the new world. But tho' the concur∣rence of all these advantages
formed an empire greater and more extensive than any known in Europe since
that of the Romans, the kingdom of France alone, being close, compact,
united, rich, populous, and being interposed between all the provinces of
Charles's dominions, was able to make a vigorous opposition to his
progress, and maintain the contest against him.</P>
<P>HENRY possessed that felicity, of being able, both by
the native force of his kingdom and its situation, to hold the ballance
between those two powers; and had he known to improve, by policy and
prudence, this singular and inestimable advantage, he was really, by means
of it, a greater prince than either of those mighty monarchs, who seemed to
strive for the dominion of Europe. But the character of this King was
heedless, inconsiderate, capricious, impolitic; guided by his passion
or his favourite; vain, imperious, haughty; sometimes actuated by
friendship for foreign powers, oftener by resentment, seldom by his true
in∣terest. And thus, tho' he triumphed in that superiority which his
situation in Europe gave him, he never employed it to the essential and
durable advantage of his kingdom or his own.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">Interview be∣tween Henry and Francis at
Calais.</NOTE> FRANCIS was well acquainted with Henry's character, and
endeavoured to ac∣commodate his conduct to it. He sollicited an interview
near Calais; in expec∣tation of being able, by familiar conversation, to gain
upon his friendship and confidence. Wolsey earnestly seconded this
proposal; and hoped, in the presence of both courts, to make parade of his
riches, his splendour, and his influence over both monarchs<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Polydore Virgil, lib. 27.</NOTE>. And as Henry himself loved
pomp and magnificence, and had entertained a curiosity of being personally
acquainted with the French King, he very chearfully adjusted all the
preliminaries of this interview. The nobility of both nations strove to
surpass each other in pomp and expence: Many of them <PB N="111" REF="116"/>
involved themselves in large debts, and were not able, by the penury of their
whole lives, to repair the vain splendour of a few days. The duke of
Bucking∣ham, who, tho' immensely rich, was somewhat addicted to frugality,
finding the preparations for this festival amount to immense sums, threw
out some ex∣pressions of displeasure against the cardinal, whom he
believed the author of that measure<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Polydore
Virgil, lib. 27. Herbert. Hollingshed, p. 855.</NOTE>. An imprudence which
proved afterwards to Buckingham the source of great misfortunes.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The emperor Charles ar∣rives in
Eng∣land.</NOTE> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">25th of May.</NOTE> WHILE Henry was preparing
to depart for Calais, he was surprized to hear that the emperor was arrived
at Dover; and he immediately hastened thither with the queen, in order to
give a suitable reception to his royal guest. That great prince, politic
tho' young, having heard of the intended interview between Francis and Henry,
was apprehensive of the consequences, and was resolved to take the
opportunity, in his passage from Spain to the Low Countries, to make the
King still a higher compliment, by paying him a visit in his own dominions.
Besides the marks of regard and attachment which he gave to Henry, he
strove, by every testimony of friendship, by flatteries, protestations,
promises and presents, to gain on the vanity, the avarice, and the ambition
of the cardinal. He here in∣stilled into this aspiring prelate the hope of
attaining the papacy; and as that was the sole point of elevation, beyond his
present greatness, it was sure to attract his wishes with the same
ardour, as if fortune had never, as yet, favoured him with any of her
presents. In hopes of reaching this dignity by the emperor's
assistance, he secretly devoted himself to that monarch's
interests; and Charles was perhaps the more liberal of his promises, that
Leo was a very young man; and it was not likely, that, for many years, he would
be called upon to fulfil his engagements. Henry easily observed this
courtship payed to his minister; but instead of taking umbrage at it, he
only made it a subject of vanity; and believed, that, as Wol∣sey's sole
support was his favour, the obeisance of such mighty monarchs to his
servant, was in reality a more conspicuous homage to his own grandeur.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">30th of May.</NOTE> THE day of Charles's
departure, Henry went over to Calais with the queen and his whole court; and
from thence proceeded to Guisnes, a small town near the frontiers. Francis,
attended in like manner, came to Andres, a few miles distant; and the two
monarchs met, for the first time, in the fields, at a place situate between
these two towns, but still within the English pale: For Francis agreed to
pay that compliment to Henry, in consideration of that prince's passing
the sea, that he might be present at the interview. Wolsey, to whom both
Kings had entrusted the regulation of the ceremonial, contrived this
circumstance, in order to do honour to his master.</P>
<P><PB N="112" REF="117"/> THE two monarchs, after saluting each
other in the most cordial manner, retired into a sent which had been erected
on purpose, and they held a secret con∣ference together. Henry here
proposed to make some amendments on the arti∣cles of their former alliance;
and he began to read the treaty, <HI>I Henry King:</HI> These were the
first words; and he stopt a moment. He subjoined only the words, <HI>of
England,</HI> without adding, <HI>France,</HI> the usual of the English
mo∣narchs<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Memoires de Fleuranges.</NOTE>. Francis
remarked this delicacy, and expressed by a smile his approba∣tion of
it.</P>
<P>HE took an opportunity soon after of paying a compliment to
Henry of a more essential nature. That generous prince, full of honour
himself, and inca∣pable of distrusting others, was shocked at all the
precautions which were ob∣served, whenever he had an interview with the
English monarch: The number of their guards and attendants was carefully
counted on both sides: Every step was scrupulously measured and
adjusted: And if the two Kings proposed to pay a visit to the queens,
they departed from their several quarters at the same instant, which was
marked by the firing of a culverin; they passed each other in the mid∣dle
point between the places; and at the same instant that Henry entered
Ardres, Francis put himself into the hands of the English at Guisnes. In
order to break off this tedious ceremony, which contained so many
dishonourable implications, Francis, one day, took with him two gentlemen and
a page, and rode directly into Guisnes. The guards were surprized at the
presence of the monarch, who called aloud to them, <HI>You are all my
prisoners: Carry me to your master.</HI> Henry was equally astonished
at the appearance of Francis; and taking him in his arms, 
<Q REND="inline">"My brother," said he, "you have here played
me the most agreeable trick in the world, and have showed me the full
confidence I may place in you: I sur∣render myself your prisoner from
this moment."</Q> He took from his neck a collar of pearls, worth 15000
angels<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">An angel was then estimated at seven
shillings, or near twelve of our present money.</NOTE>; and putting it
about Francis's, begged him to wear it, for the sake of his prisoner.
Francis agreed, but on condition that Henry should wear a bracelet, of which
he made him a present, and which was double in value to the collar<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Memoires de Fleuranges.</NOTE>. The King went next
day to Ardres, with∣out guards or attendants; and confidence being now fully
established between the monarchs, they employed the rest of the time
entirely in tournaments and festivals.</P>
<P>A DEFIANCE had been sent by the two Kings to each others
court, and thro' all the chief cities of Europe, importing, that Henry and
Francis, with fourteen aids, would be ready, in the plains of Picardy, to
answer all comers, that were <PB N="113" REF="118"/> gentlemen, at tilt,
tourney, and barriers. The monarchs, in order to fulfil this challenge,
advanced into the field on horseback, Francis surrounded with Henry's
guards, and Henry with those of Francis. They were gorgiously apparelled;
and were both of them the most comely personages of the age, as well as the
most expert in every military exercise. They carried away the prize at all
trials in those rough and dangerous pastimes; and several horses and
riders were over∣thrown by their vigour and dexterity. The ladies were the
judges in these seats of chivalry, and put an end to the rencounter
whenever they judged it expedient. Henry erected a spacious house of wood
and canvas, which had been framed in London; and he here feasted the French
monarch. He had placed a motto on this fabric, under the figure of an English
archer embroidered on it, <HI>Cui adhaereo praeest. He prevails whom I
favour</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mezcray.</NOTE>: Expressing his own
situation, as holding in his hands the ballance of power among the potentates
of Europe. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">24th of June.</NOTE> In these
entertainments, more than in any serious business, did the two Kings
pass the time, till their departure.</P>
<P>HENRY, after his return to Calais, paid a visit to the emperor
and Margaret of Savoy at Gravelines, and engaged them to go along with him to
Calais, and pass some days in that fortress. The artful and politic
Charles here compleated the impression, which he had begun to make on Henry
and his favourite, and effaced all the friendship, to which the frank and
liberal nature of Francis had given birth. As the house of Austria began
sensibly to take the ascendant over the French monarchy, the interests
of England required that some support should be given to the latter, and
above all, that any important wars should be prevented, which might bestow
on either of them a decisive superiority over the other. But the jealousy
of the English against France has ever prevented a cordial union between
these nations: And Charles, sensible of this hereditary animosity, and
desirous farther to flatter Henry's vanity, had made him an offer, (an offer
in which Francis was afterwards obliged to concur) that he should be entire
arbiter in any dispute or difference that should arise between the
monarchs. But the great masterpiece of Charles's politics was the securing
Wolsey in his interests, by very important services, and still higher
promises. He renewed assurances of assisting him in obtaining the
papacy; and he put him in present possession of the revenues,
belonging to the sees of Badajox and Palencia in Castile. The
acqui∣sitions of Wolsey were now become so exorbitant, that, joined to
the pensions from foreign powers, which Henry allowed him to possess,
his revenues were computed nearly to equal those which belonged to the crown
itself; and he spent <PB N="114" REF="119"/> them with a magnificence, or
rather an ostentation, which gave general offence to the people; and much
lessened his master in the eyes of all foreign nations<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Polydore Virgil. Hall.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1521" UNIT="year"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">War between Charles and Francis.</NOTE> THE
violent personal emulation and political jealousy which had taken place
between the emperor and the French King, soon broke into action. Francis
sent an army into Navarre under the command of De Foix, in order to replace
the family of Albert in the possession of that kingdom; and this
en∣terprize could not have been complained of as a breach of treaty, if De Foix
had confined himself to that equitable design. But after he had subdued
Na∣varre, finding Spain in great disorder from the insurrections of the
people, he thought the opportunity favourable, and he ventured, with Francis's
approba∣tion, to lay fiege to Logrogno in Castile. This invasion, contrary
to what was expected, put an end to the domestic dissentions of the
Castilians; who attacked the French, obliged them to raise the siege,
pursued the advantage, and entirely expelled them Navarre, which has ever
since remained united with the Spa∣nish monarchy<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Vera, hist. de Charl. V.</NOTE>. Robert de la Marck, duke of
Boüillon and prince of Sedan, having received some disgust from the
governess of the Low Countries, had taken arms and invaded those provinces;
and had even sent a challenge or defiance to the emperor himself<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Memoires de Bellay, lib. 1.</NOTE>: A boldness,
which seemed entirely unaccountable, except on the supposition that this
petty prince had received secret encouragement from Francis. On the other
hand, Charles, in order to chastise the insolence of Ro∣bert, had levied
a powerful army, and advanced to the frontiers of France, which he threatened
with an invasion. Hostilities were soon carried farther; his gene∣rals
besieged Mouson, which they took; they invested Mezieres, where they met
with a repulse. In Italy likewise the two monarchs were not inactive.
Francis negotiated with the Pope, in order to engage him to concur in expelling
the im∣perialists from Naples: But Charles had the address to finish his
league with the same power for expelling the French from Milan; and the
united arms of the allies had invaded that dutchy, and had almost entirely
finished their enterprize.</P>
<P>WHILE these ambitious and warlike princes were committing
hostilities on each other in every part of Europe, they still made
professions of the strongest desire of peace; and both of them
carried incessantly their complaints to Henry, as to the arbiter or umpire
between them. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mediation of Henry.</NOTE> The King, who
appeared neutral, engaged them to send their ambassadors to Calais, there
to negotiate a peace under the mediation of Wolsey and the pope's nuntio. The
emperor was well acquainted with the par∣tiality of these mediators; and his
demands in the conference were so unreasonable, as plainly proved him
conscious of this advantage. He required the restitution 
<PB N="115" REF="120"/> of Burgundy, a province, which had been ceded many years
before by treaty, and which would have given him access into the midst of
France: And he de∣manded to be freed from the homage, which his ancestors had
ever paid for Flanders and Artois, and which he himself had, by the treaty of
Noyon, pro∣mised to renew. On Francis's rejecting these terms, the
congress at Calais broke up, and Wolsey, soon after, took a journey to
Bruges, where he met with the emperor. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">24th of No∣vember.</NOTE> He was received with
the same state, magnificence, and respect, as if he had been the King of
England himself; and he concluded in his master's name an offensive
alliance with the pope and the emperor against France. He engaged that
England should next summer invade that kingdom with forty thou∣sand men;
and he betrothed to Charles the princess Mary, the King's only child, who had
now some prospect of inheriting the crown. This extravagant alliance, which
was prejudicial to the interests, and might have proved fatal to the liberty
and independance of the kingdom, was the result of the humours and prejudices
of the King, and the private views and expectations of the cardinal.</P>
<P>THE people saw every day new instances of the uncontrouled
authority of this minister. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Trial and con∣demnation of the duke of
Buckingham.</NOTE> The duke of Buckingham, constable of England, the first
nobleman both for family and fortune in the kingdom, had been so unfortunate
as to give disgust to the cardinal, and it was not long before he found
reason to repent his indiscretion. He seems to have been a man full of
levity and rash projects; and being infatuated with judicial astrology, he
entertained commerce with one Hop∣kins, a carthusian monk, who encouraged him
with the notion of mounting one day the throne of England. He was descended
by a female from the duke of Glocester, youngest son of Edward the third;
and tho' his claim to the crown was thereby very remote, he had been so
imprudent as to let fall some expressions, as if he thought himself
best intitled, in case the King should die without issue, to
possess the royal dignity. He had not even abstained from threats
against the King's life, and had provided himself of arms, which he
intended to employ, in case a favourable opportunity should offer. He was
brought to a trial; and the duke of Norfolk, whose son, the earl of Surrey,
had married Buckingham's daughter, was created loed steward, in order to
preside at this solemn procedure. The jury consisted of a duke, a
marquis, seven earls, and twelve barons; and they gave sentence against
Buckingham, which was soon after put in execution. There is no reason to
think the sentence unjust<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Herbert. Hall. Stow, 513.
Hollingshed, p. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>62.</NOTE>; 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">17th of May.</NOTE> but as Buckingham's crime
seemed to proceed more from indiscretion than deliberate malice, the
people, who loved that nobleman, expected that the King would grant him a
pardon, and ascribed their disappointment to the malice and revenge of the
cardinal. The <PB N="116" REF="121"/> King's own jealousy, however, against
all pretenders to the crown, was, not∣withstanding his undoubted title, very
remarkable during the whole course of his reign; and was alone sufficient
to render him implacable against Buckingham. The office of constable, which
Buckingham inherited from the Bohuns, earls of Hereford, was forfeited, and was
never after revived by Henry.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>DURING some years, many parts of Europe had been agitated with
those religious controversies, which produced the reformation, one of the
greatest events in history: But as it was not till this time, that the King
of England pub∣lickly took part in the quarrel, we had no occasion to give
any account of its rise and progress. It will now be necessary to
explain these theological disputes; or what is more material, to trace from
their origin those abuses, which so ge∣nerally diffused the opinion,
that a reformation of the church or ecclesiastical order was become highly
expedient, if not absolutely necessary. We shall be better enabled to
comprehend the subject, if we take the matter a little higher, and reflect a
moment on the reasons, why there must be an ecclesiastical order, and a
public establishment of religion in every civilized community. The
im∣portance of the present occasion will, I hope, excuse this short
digression.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Digression concerning the
ecclesiasti∣cal state.</NOTE> MOST of the arts and professions in a
state are of such a nature, that, while they promote the interests of the
society, they are also useful or agreeable to some individuals; and in
that case, the constant rule of the magistrate, except, per∣haps, on the
first introduction of any art, is, to leave the profession to itself,
and trust its encouragement to the individuals, who reap the benefit of it.
The arti∣zans, finding their profits to rise by the favour of their
customers, encrease, as <PB N="117" REF="122"/> much as possible, their
skill and industry; and as matters are not disturbed by any injudicious
tampering, the commodity is always sure to be at all times ex∣actly
proportioned to the demand.</P>
<P>BUT there are also some callings, which, tho' useful and
even necessary in a state, bring no advantage nor pleasure to any
individuals; and the supreme power is obliged to alter its conduct with
regard to the retainers of those professions. It must give them public
encouragement in order to their subsistance; and it must provide
against that negligence, to which they will naturally be subject, either by
annexing particular honour to the profession, by establishing a long
subordination of ranks and a strict dependance, or by some other
expedient. The persons employed in the finances, armies, fleets, and
magistracy are in∣stances of this order of men.</P>
<P>IT may naturally be thought, at first view, that the
ecclesiastics belong to the first class, and that their encouragement,
as well as that of lawyers and physi∣cians, may safely be trusted to the
liberality of individuals, who are attached to their doctrines, and who find
benefit or consolation from their spiritual ministry and
assistance. Their industry and vigilance will, no doubt, be whetted by
such an additional motive; and their skill in the profession, as well
as their address in governing the minds of the people, must receive daily
encrease, from their encreasing practice, study, and attention.</P>
<P>BUT if we consider the matter more closely, we shall find,
that this interested diligence of the clergy is what every wise
legislator will study to avoid; because in every religion, except the
true, it is highly pernicious, and has even a natural tendency to pervert the
true, by infusing into it a strong mixture of superstition, folly, and
delusion. Each ghostly practitioner, in order to render himself more
precious and sacred in the eyes of his retainers, must inspire them with
the most violent abhorrence against all other sects, and continually
endeavour, by some novelty, to excite the languid devotion of his audience.
No regard will be paid to truth, morals, or decency in the doctrines
inculcated. Every tenet will be adopted, that best suits the disorderly
affections of the human frame. Customers will be drawn to each conventicle by
new industry and address in practising on the passions and credulity
of the populace. And in the end, the civil magistrate will find, that he has
paid dearly for his pretended frugality, in saving a settled foundation for
the priests; and that in reality the most decent and advantageous
composition, which he can make with the spiritual guides, is to bribe their
in∣dolence, by affixing stated sallaries to their profession, and
rendering it super∣fluous for them to be farther active, than merely to
preserve their flock from straying in quest of new pastures. And in
this manner ecclesiastical establish∣ments, <PB N="118" REF="123"/> tho'
commonly they arose at first from religious views, prove in the end
advantageous to the political interests of society.</P>
<P>BUT we may observe, that few ecclesiastical
establishments have been fixed upon a worse foundation than that of the
church of Rome, or have been at∣tended with circumstances more hurtful to the
peace and happiness of mankind.</P>
<P>THE large revenues, privileges, immunities, and powers of the
clergy ren∣dered them formidable to the civil magistrate, and armed with too
extensive authority an order of men, who always adhere closely together,
and who never want a plausible pretence for their encroachments and
usurpations. The higher dignities of the church served, indeed, to the
support of gentry and nobility; but by the establishment of
monasteries, many of the lowest vulgar were taken from the useful arts,
and maintained in those receptacles of sloth and ignorance. The supreme
head of the church was a foreign potentate, who was guided by interests,
always different, sometimes contrary to those of the community. And as the
hierarchy was necessarily solicitous to preserve an unity of faith,
rites and ceremonies, all liberty of thought ran a manifest risque of being
extinguished; and violent persecutions, or what was worse, a stupid and
abject credulity, took place every where.</P>
<P>TO encrease these evils, the church, tho' she
possessed large revenues, was not contented with her acquisitions,
but retained a power of practising farther on the ignorance of mankind. She
even bestowed on each individual priest a power of enriching himself by
the voluntary oblations of the faithful, and left him still a powerful motive
for diligence and industry in his calling. And thus, that church, tho' an
expensive and burthensome establishment, was liable to many of the
inconveniencies, which belong to an order of priests, trusted entirely to
their own art and invention for attaining a subsistance.</P>
<P>THE advantages, attending the Romish hierarchy, were but a
small compen∣sation for its inconveniencies. The ecclesiastical
privileges, during barbarous times, had served as a cheque to the
despotism of Kings. The union of all the western churches under the
supreme pontiff facilitated the intercourse of nations, and tended to bind
Europe into an immense republic. And the pomp and splendour of worship,
which belonged to so opulent an establishment, contri∣buted, in some
respects, to the encouragement of the fine arts, and began to diffuse a
general elegance of taste, by uniting it with religion.</P>
<P>IT will easily be conceived, that, tho' the ballance of evil
prevailed in the Romish church, this was not the chief reason, which
produced the reformation. A concurrence of incidents must have contributed to
forward that great work.</P>
<P><PB N="119" REF="124"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Origin of the reformation.</NOTE> POPE Leo the
tenth, by his generous and enterprizing temper, had very much ex∣hausted the
treasury, and was obliged to make use of every invention, which might yield
money, in order to support his projects, pleasures, and liberalities. The
scheme of selling indulgences was suggested to him, as an expedient
which had often served in former times to draw money from the christian
world, and make devout people willing contributors to the grandeur and riches
of the court of Rome. The church, it was supposed, was possessed of
a great stock of merit, as being intitled to all the good works of the
saints, beyond what were employed in their own justification; and even to
the merits of Christ himself, which were infinite and unbounded: And from
this unexhausted treasury, the pope might retail particular portions, and
by that traffic acquire money, to be employed in pious purposes, the
resisting the Turk, or subduing schismatics. When the money came into
his treasury, the greatest part of it was usually diverted to other
purposes<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Father Paul and Sleidan.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IT is commonly believed, that Leo, from the penetration of his
genius, and his familiarity with literature, was fully acquainted with the
ridicule and fallacy of the doctrines, which, as supreme pontiff, he was
obliged by his interest to promote: And it is the less wonder, therefore,
that he employed for his profit those pious frauds, which his
predecessors, the most ignorant and credulous, had always, under
plausible pretexts, made use of for their selfish purposes. He
published the sale of a general indulgence<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">In 1517.</NOTE>; and as his expences had not only exhausted his
usual revenue, but even anticipated the income of this extraordinary
expedient, the several branches of it were openly given away to particular
per∣sons, who were entitled to levy the imposition. The produce
particularly of Saxony and the countries bordering on the Baltic was
assigned to his sister, Mag∣dalene, married to Cibo, natural son of
Innocent the eighth; and she, in order to enhance her profit, had farmed out
the revenue to one Arcemboldi, a Genoese, now a bishop, formerly a
merchant, who still retained all the lucrative arts of his former
profession<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Father Paul, Sleidan.</NOTE>. The
Austin friars had usually been employed in Saxony to preach the
indulgences, and from this trust had derived both profit and
consi∣deration: But Arcemboldi, fearing, lest practice might have taught
them means to secret the money<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Father Paul, lib.
1.</NOTE>, and expecting no extraordinary success from the ordinary methods
of collection, gave this occupation to the dominicans. These monks, in order
to prove themselves worthy of the distinction conferred on them,
exag∣gerated the benefit of indulgences by the most unbounded panegyrics; and
ad∣vanced doctrines on that head, which, tho' not more ridiculous than those
al∣ready received, were such as the ears of the people were not yet fully
accustomed <PB N="120" REF="125"/> to. To add to the scandal, the collectors
of this revenue are said to have lived very licentious lives, and to have
spent in taverns, gaming houses, and places still more infamous, the
money, which devout persons had saved from their usual expences, in order
to purchase a remission of their sins<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Father
Paul, lib. 1.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>ALL these circumstances might have given offence, but would
have been at∣tended with no event of any importance, had there not arisen a
man, qualified to take advantage of the incident. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Martin Lu∣ther.</NOTE> Martin Luther, an
Austin friar, professor in the university of Wirtemberg, resenting
the affront put upon his order, began to preach against these abuses in
the sale of indulgences; and being naturally of a fiery temper, and being
provoked by opposition, he proceeded even to decry indulgences themselves;
and was thence carried, by the heat of dispute, to question the authority
of the pope, from which his adversaries derived their chief arguments
against him<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Father Paul, Sleidan.</NOTE>.
Still as he enlarged his reading, in order to support these tenets, he
discovered some new abuse or error in the church of Rome; and finding his
opinions greedily hearkened to, he promulgated them by writing, discourses,
sermons, conferences; and daily encreased the number of his disciples.
All Saxony, all Germany, all Europe were in a very little time filled with the
voice of this daring innovator; and men, rouzed from that lethargy, in which
they had so long slept, began to call in question the most antient and
most re∣ceived opinions. The elector of Saxony, favourable to Luther's
doctrine, pro∣tected him from the violence of the papal jurisdiction: The
republic of Zuric even reformed their church according to the new model: Many
sovereigns of the empire, and the imperial diet itself, showed a
favourable disposition towards it: And Luther, a man naturally inflexible,
vehement, opinionative, was be∣come incapable, either from promises of
advancement, or terrors of severity, to relinquish a sect, of which he
was himself the founder, and which brought him a glory, superior to all
others, the glory of dictating the religious faith and prin∣ciples of
multitudes.</P>
<P>THE rumour of these innovations soon reached England; and as
there still subsisted in that kingdom great remains of the Lollards,
whose principles resembled those of Luther, the new doctrines gained
secretly many partizans among the laiety of all ranks and denominations.
Henry had been educated in a strict at∣tachment to the church of Rome, and he
bore a particular prejudice against Luther, who, in his writings, spoke
with contempt of Thomas Aquinas, the King's favourite author: He opposed
himself therefore to the progress of the Lutheran tenets, by all the
influence which his extensive and almost absolute au∣thority 
<PB N="121" REF="126"/> conferred upon him: He even undertook to combat them
with weapons not usually employed by monarchs, especially those in the
flower of their age, and force of their passions. He wrote a book in Latin
against the principles of Luther; a performance, which, if allowance be made
for the subject and the age, does no discredit to his capacity. He sent a
copy of it to Leo, who re∣ceived so magnificent a present with great
testimony of regard; 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Henry re∣ceives the title of defender of the
faith.</NOTE> and conferred on him, the title of <HI>defender of the
faith;</HI> an appellation still retained by the Kings of England. Luther,
who was in the heat of controversy, soon wrote an answer to Henry; and
without regard to the dignity of his antagonist, treated him with all the
acrimony of style, to which, in the course of his polemics, he had so
long been accustomed. The King, by this ill usage, was still more
preju∣diced against the new doctrines; but the public, who naturally favour
the weaker party, were inclined to attribute to Luther the victory in the
dispute<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Father Paul, lib. 1.</NOTE>. And as
the controversy became more illustrious, by Henry's entering the lists,
it drew more the attention of mankind; and the Lutheran doctrine acquired daily
new converts in every part of Europe.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Causes of the progress of the
reformation.</NOTE> THE quick and surprizing progress of this bold sect
may justly in part be ascribed to the late invention of printing, and
revival of learning: Not that reason bore any considerable part, in opening
men's eyes with regard to the im∣postures of the Romish church: For of all
branches of literature, philosophy had, as yet, and till long afterwards,
made the most inconsiderable progress; neither is there any instance
where argument has been able to free the people from that enormous load of
absurdity, with which superstition has every where over∣whelmed them: Not
to mention, that the rapid advance of the Lutheran doc∣trine, and the violence,
with which it was embraced, prove sufficiently, that it owed not its
success to reason and reflection. The art of printing and the revival of
learning forwarded its progress in another manner. By means of that art, the
books of Luther and his sectaries, full of vehemence, declamation and a rude
eloquence, were propagated more quickly, and in greater numbers. The minds of
men, somewhat awakened from a profound sleep of so many centuries, were
prepared for every novelty, and scrupled less to tread in any unusual
path, which was opened to them. And as copies of the scriptures and other
antient monu∣ments of the christian faith became more common, men perceived
the innova∣tions, which were introduced after the first centuries; and though
argument and reasoning could not give conviction, an historical fact, well
supported, was able to make impression on their understandings. Many of
the powers, indeed, assumed by the church of Rome, were very antient, and
were prior to almost every <PB N="122" REF="127"/> political government
established in Europe: But as the ecclesiastics would not submit to
possess their privileges as matters of civil right, which time could
ren∣der valid, but appealed still to a divine origin, men were tempted to
look into their primitive charter; and they could, without much difficulty,
perceive its defect in truth and authenticity.</P>
<P>IN order to bestow on this topic the greater influence, Luther
and his followers, not satisfied with opposing the pretended divinity of
the Romish church, and displaying the temporal inconveniencies of that
establishment, carried matters much farther, and treated the religion of
their ancestors, as abominable, detest∣able, damnable; foretold by sacred
writ itself as the source of all wickedness and pollution. They
denominated the pope antichrist, called his communion the scarlet whore,
and gave to Rome the appellation of Babylon; expressions, which, however
applied, were to be found in scripture, and which were better calculated to
operate on the multitude than the most solid arguments. Excited by
contest and persecution on the one hand, by success and applause on
the other, many of the reformers carried their opposition to the greatest
extremity against the church of Rome; and in contradiction to the multiplied
superstitions, with which that communion was loaded, they adopted an
enthusiastic strain of devo∣tion, which admitted of no observances,
rites or ceremonies, but placed all merit in a mysterious species of faith,
in inward vision, rapture, and extacy. The new sectaries, seized with
this spirit, were indefatigable in the propagation of their doctrine, and
set at defiance all the anathemas and punishments, with which the Roman
pontiff endeavoured to overwhelm them.</P>
<P>THAT the civil power, however, might afford them protection
against the ecclesiastical jurisdiction, the Lutherans advanced
doctrines favourable, in some respects, to the temporal authority of
sovereigns. They inveighed against the abuses of the court of Rome, with
which men were at that time generally dis∣contented; and exhorted princes to
reinstate themselves in those powers, of which the incroaching spirit
of the ecclesiastics, and especially of the sovereign pontiff, had so
long bereaved them. They condemned celibacy and monastic vows, and thereby
opened the doors of the convents to those who were either tired of the
obedience and chastity, or disgusted with the licence, in which they had
hitherto lived. They blamed the excessive riches, the idleness, the
libertin∣ism of the clergy; and pointed out their treasures and revenues as
lawful spoil to the first invader. And as the ecclesiastics had
hitherto conducted a willing and a stupid audience, and were totally
unacquainted with controversy, and even every species of literature; they
were unable to defend themselves against men, armed with authorities,
citations, and popular topics, and qualified to triumph in every 
<PB N="123" REF="128"/> altercation or debate. Such were the advantages, with
which the reformers be∣gan their attack of the Roman hierarchy; and such were
the causes of their rapid and astonishing success.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">1st December.</NOTE> LEO the tenth, whose
oversights and too supine trust in the profound ignorance of the people,
had given rise to this sect, but whose sound judgment, modera∣tion and
temper, were well qualified to retard its progress, died in the flower of his
age, a little after he received the King's book against Lusher; and he was
succeeded in the papal chair, by Adrian, a Fleming, tutor to the emperor
Charles. This man was qualified to gain on the reformers by the integrity,
can∣dour, and simplicity of manners, by which he was distinguished; but,
so vio∣lent were their prejudices against the church, he rather hurt the
cause by his impru∣dent exercise of those virtues. He frankly
confessed, that many abominable and detestable practices prevailed in the
court of Rome; and by this sincere avowal, he gave occasion of much triumph
to the Lutherans. This pontiff also, whose penetration was not equal to his
good intentions, was seduced to concur in that league, which Charles and
Henry had formed against France<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Guicciardini, lib.
14.</NOTE>; and he thereby augmented the scandal, occasioned by the
practice of so many preceding popes, who still made their spiritual arms
subservient to political purposes.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1522" UNIT="year"/> THE emperor, Charles, who
knew, that Wolsey had received a disappoint∣ment in his ambitious hopes by
the election of Adrian, and who dreaded the re∣sentment of that haughty
minister, was solicitous to repair the breach made in their friendship by
this incident. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">26th May.</NOTE> He paid a new visit to
England; and besides flattering the vanity of the King and the cardinal, he
repeated to Wolsey all the promises, which he had made him, of seconding
his pretensions to the papal throne. Wolsey, sensible that Adrian's
great age and infirmities promised a sudden vacancy, dissembled his
resentment, and was willing to hope for a more prosperous issue of the
next election. The emperor renewed the treaty made at Bruges, to which some
articles were added; and he agreed to indemnify both the King and Wolsey for
the revenues which they should lose by a breach with France. The more to
ingratiate himself with Henry and the English nation; he gave to Surrey,
admiral of England, a commission for being admiral of his do∣minions; and
he himself was installed knight of the garter at London. After a stay of
six weeks in England, he embarked at Southampton, and in ten days arrived in
Spain, where he soon pacified the tumults which had arisen in his
absence<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Petrus de Angleria, epist.
765.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="124" REF="129"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">War with France.</NOTE> THE King declared war
against France; and this measure was founded on so little reason, that
he could allege nothing as a ground of quarrel, but Francis's refusal to
submit to his arbitration, and his sending Albany into Scotland. This
last step had not been taken by the French King, till he was quite
assured of Henry's resolution to attack him. Surrey landed some troops
at Cherbourg in Normandy; and after laying waste the country, he
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ailed to Morlaix, a rich town in
Britanny, which he took and plundered. The English merchants had great
property in that place, which was no more spared by the soldiers, than the
goods of the French. Surrey then left the charge of the fleet to the
vice-admi∣ral; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ailed to
Calais, where he took the command of the English army, destined for the
invasion of France. This army, when joined by forces from the Low Countries
under the command of the count of Buren, consisted in the whole of 18,000
men.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Invasion of France.</NOTE> THE French had
made it a maxim in all their wars with the English, since the reign of
Charles the fifth, never, without great necessity, to hazard a general
engagement; and the duke of Vendome, who commanded the French army, now
embraced this wise policy. He supplied the towns most exposed,
especially Boulogne, Montreuil, Teroüenne, Hedin, with strong
garrisons and plenty of provisions: He himself took post at Abbeville,
with some Swiss and French in∣fantry, and a body of cavalry: The count of
Guise encamped under Montreuil with six thousand men. These two bodies
were in a situation to join upon oc∣casion; to throw succour into any
town, that was threatened; and to harrass the English in every movement.
Surrey, who was not supplied with magazines, first divided his army for the
convenience of sublisting them; but finding that his quarters were every
moment beaten up by the activity of the French gene∣rals, he drew together the
forces, and laid siege to Hedin. But neither did he succeed in this
enterprize. The garrison made vigorous sallies upon his army: The French
forces assaulted them from without: Great rains fell: Fatigue and bad
weather threw the soldiers into dysenteries: And Surrey was obliged to
raise the siege, and put his troops into winter quarters about the end of
October. His rear guard was attacked at Pas in Artois; and five or six
hundred men were cut off; nor could all his efforts make him master of one
place within the French frontier.</P>
<P>THE allies were more successful in Italy. Lautrec, who
commanded the French, lost a bloody battle at Bicocca near Milan; and was
obliged to retire with the remains of his army. This misfortune, which
proceeded from Francis's negligence in not supplying Lautrec with money<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Guicciardini, lib. 14.</NOTE>, was followed by the loss of
<PB N="125" REF="130"/> Genoa. The castle of Cremona was the sole fortress
in Italy, which remained in the hands of the French.</P>
<P>EUROPE was now in such a situation, and so connected by
alliances and interest, that it was almost impossible for war to be
kindled in one part, and not diffuse itself thro' the whole: But of all the
leagues among kingdoms, the closest was that which had so long
subsisted between France and Scotland; and the English, while at war
with the former nation, could not expect to remain long unmolested on the
northern frontier. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">War with Scotland.</NOTE> No sooner had
Albany arrived in Scotland, than he took measures for kindling a war with
England; and he summoned the whole force of the kingdom to meet in the fields
of Rosline<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Buchannan, lib. 14. Drummond.
Pitscottie.</NOTE>. He thence conducted the army southwards into Annandale;
and prepared to pass the borders at Solway-Firth. But many of the nobility
were disgusted with the regent's administration; and observing, that
his connexions with his native country were very feeble in comparison of
those with France, they murmured, that for the sake of foreign
in∣terests, their peace should be so often disturbed, and war, during
their King's minority, be wantonly entered into with a neighbouring nation,
so much superior in force and riches. The Gordons, in particular, refused
to advance any farther; and Albany, observing a general discontent to
prevail, was obliged to conclude a truce with lord Dacres, warden of the
English west marches. Soon after, he departed for France; and lest the
opposite faction should gather force in his absence, he sent thither
before him the earl of Angus, husband to the queen dowager.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1523" UNIT="year"/> NEXT year, Henry, that he
might take advantage of the regent's absence, marched an army into Scotland
under the command of Surrey, who ravaged the Merse and Teviotdale without
opposition, and burned the town of Jedburgh. The Scotch had neither King nor
Regent to conduct them: The two Humes had been put to death: Angus was in a
manner banished: No nobleman of vigour or authority remained, who was
qualified to assume the government: And the Eng∣lish monarch, who knew
the distrest situation of the country, was determined to push them to
extremity, in hopes of engaging them, by the sense of their present
miseries, to make a solemn renounciation of the French alliance, and
embrace that of England<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Buchannan, lib. 14.
Herbert.</NOTE>. He even gave them hopes of contracting a marriage between the
lady Mary, heiress of England, and their young monarch; an expedient, which
would for ever unite the two kingdoms<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Le Grand,
vol. III. p. 39.</NOTE>: And the queen dowager, with her <PB N="126" REF="131"/>
whole party, recommended <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> where
the advantages of this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and or
a confederacy with England. They said, that the interests of Scotland had
too long been sacrificed to those of the French nation, who, whenever they
found themselves reduced to difficulties, called for the assistance of
their allies, but were ready to abandon them, so soon as they found their
advantage in making peace with England: That where a small state entered
into so close a confederacy with a greater, it must always expect this
treatment, as a consequence of the unequal alliance; but that there were
peculiar circumstances in the situation of the king∣doms, which, in the
present case, rendered it inevitable: That France was so distant and
so divided from them by seas, that she scarce could by any means, and
never could in time, send succours to the Scotch, sufficient to protect
them against ravages from the neighbouring kingdom: That nature had, in a
manner, framed an alliance between the two British nations; having enclosed
them in the same island; given them the same manners, language, laws, and
form of govern∣ment; and prepared every thing for an intimate union between
them: And that, if national antipathies were abolished, which would soon be
the effect of peace, these two kingdoms, secured by the ocean and by their
domestic force, could set at defiance all foreign enemies, and remain for
ever secure and unmolested.</P>
<P>THE partizans of the French alliance said, on the other hand,
that the very reasons, which were urged in favour of a league with England,
the close neigh∣bourhood of the kingdom and its superior force, were the
real causes, why a sincere and durable confederacy could never be framed
with that hostile nation: That among neighbouring states, occasions of
quarrel were frequent; and the more powerful people would be sure to seize
every frivolous pretence for oppressing the weaker, and reducing them to
subjection: That as the near neighbourhood of France and England had kindled
a war almost perpetual between them, it was the interest of the Scotch, if
they wished to maintain their independancy, to preserve their league with
the former kingdom, which balanced the force of the latter: That if they
deserted that old and salutary alliance, on which their importance in
Europe chiefly depended, their antient enemies, stimulated both by interest
and by passion, would soon invade them with superior force, and reduce
them to sub∣jection: Or if they delayed the attack, the insidious peace, by
making the Scotch lose the use of arms, would only prepare the way for a
slavery more certain and more irretrieveable<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Buchannan, lib. 14.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE arguments employed by the French party, being seconded by
the natural prejudices of the people, seemed rather to prevail: And when the
regent himself, who had been long detained beyond his appointed time by the
terror of the English <PB N="127" REF="132"/> fleet, at last appeared among
them, he was able to throw the balance entirely on that side. By the
authority of the convention of states, he assembled an army, with a view
of avenging the ravages committed by the English in the beginning of the
campaign; and he led them southwards towards the borders. But when they were
passing the Tweed at the bridge of Melross, the English party were
again able to raise such opposition, that Albany thought proper to make a
retreat. He marched downwards, along the banks of the Tweed, keeping that river
on his right; and fixed his camp opposite to Werk-Castle, which Surrey had
lately repaired. He sent over some troops to besiege that fortress, who
made a breach in it, and stormed some of the outworks: But the regent,
hearing of the ap∣proach of an English army, and discouraged by the
advanced season, thought proper to disband his forces and retire to
Edinburgh. Soon after he went over to France, and never again returned to
Scotland. The Scotch nation, agitated by their domestic factions, were not,
during several years, in a condition to give any more disturbance to
England; and Henry had full leisure to prosecute his designs on the
continent.</P>
<P>THE reason, why the war against France proceeded so
slowly on the part of England was the want of money. All Henry the
seventh's treasures were long since dissipated; the King's habits of
expence still remained; and his revenues were unequal even to the ordinary
support of his government, much more to his military enterprizes. He had
last year caused a general survey to be made of the kingdom; the numbers
of men, their years, profession, stock, revenue<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Herbert. Stowe, 514.</NOTE>; and expressed great
satisfaction on finding the nation so opulent. He then issued out privy
seals to the most wealthy, demanding loans of particular sums; and this
act of power, tho' somewhat irregular and tyrannical, had been formerly
practised by the Kings of England; and the people were now familiarized to
it. But Henry carried his authority much farther on this occasion. He
issued an edict for a general tax upon his subjects, which he still
called a loan; and he levied five shillings in the pound from the clergy, two
shillings from the laity. This pre∣tended loan, as being more regular, was
really more dangerous to the liberties of the people; and was a precedent for
the King's imposing taxes without consent of Parliament.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">15th of April.</NOTE> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Parliament.</NOTE> HENRY summoned a
Parliament this year, together with a convocation; and
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound neither of them in a
disposition to complain of the infringement of their privileges. It was
only doubted, how far they would carry their liberality to the King. Wolsey,
who had undertaken the management of this affair, began with 
<PB N="128" REF="133"/> the convocation; in hopes, that their example would
influence the Parliament to grant a large supply. He demanded a moiety of
their ecclesiastical revenues to be levied in five years, or two
shillings in the pound during that time, and tho' he met with opposition,
he reprimanded so severely the refractory members, that his request was
at last complied with. The cardinal afterwards, attended by several of the
nobility and prelates, came to the house of commons; and in a long and
elaborate speech laid before them the public necessities, the dangers of
an invasion from Scotland, the affronts received from France, the league in
which the King was engaged with the pope and the emperor; and he demand∣ed a
grant of 800,000 pounds, divided into four yearly payments; a sum, com∣puted
from the late survey or valuation, to be equivalent to four shillings in
the pound of one year's revenue, or one shilling in the pound yearly,
according to the division proposed. So large a grant was unusual from the
commons; and tho' the cardinal's demand was seconded by Sir Thomas More the

voted two shillings in the pound on all possessed of twenty pounds a

shillings a year; and on all the rest of the subjects above sixteen
years of age a groat a-head. This last sum was divided into two yearly
payments; the former into four yearly payments, and was not therefore at the
outmost above six-pence in the pound. The grant of the commons was but the
moiety of the sum demanded; and the cardinal, therefore, much mortified with
the disappointment, came again to the house, and desired to reason with
such as refused to comply with the King's request. He was told, that it
was a rule of the house never to reason but among themselves; and his
desire was rejected. The commons, however, enlarged a little their former
grant, and voted an imposition of three shillings in the pound on all
possessed of fifty pounds a year, and upwards<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is said, that when Henry heard that the commons made a great

mortification to hear him speak in these words: <HI>Ho! man! will they not
suffer my bill to pass?</HI> And laying his hand on Montague's head, who
was then on his knees before him: <HI>Get my bill passed by to morrow, or

tenacious of their money, and refused a demand of the crown, which was far
from unreasonable; but they allowed an encroachment on national privileges to
pass uncensured, tho' its direct tendency was to subvert entirely the
liberties of the people. The King was so dissatisfied with this saving
disposition of the com∣mons, that, as he had not called a Parliament during
seven years before, he al∣lowed seven more to elapse, before he
summoned another. And under pretence of necessity, he levied, in one
year, from all who were worth forty pounds, what the parliament had granted him
payable in four years<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Speed. Hall.
Herbert.</NOTE>; a new invasion of national privileges. These
irregularities were commonly ascribed to the cardinal's coun∣sels, who,
trusting to the protection, afforded him by his ecclesiastical character,
was less scrupulous in his encroachments on the civil rights of the
nation.</P>
<P>THAT ambitious prelate received this year a new disappointment
in his aspiring views. The pope, Adrian the sixth, died; and Clement the
seventh, of the family of Medici, was elected in his place, by the
concurrence of the imperial party. Wolsey began now to perceive the
insincerity of the emperor, and concluded that that prince would never
second his pretensions to the papal chair. This injury was highly
resented by the cardinal; and he began thenceforth to estrange him∣self
from the imperial court, and to pave the way for an union between his mas∣ter
and the French King. Meanwhile, he dissembled his resentment; and after
congratulating the new pope on his promotion, applied for a continuation of the
legantine powers, which the two former popes had conferred upon him. Clement,
knowing the importance of gaining his friendship, granted him a
commission for life; and by this unusual concession, he in a manner
transferred to him the whole papal authority in England. In some particulars,
Wolsey made a good use of this extensive power. He erected two colleges,
one at Oxford, another at Ipswich, the place of his nativity: He sought,
all over Europe, for learned men to supply the chairs of these colleges:
And in order to bestow endowments on them, he suppressed some
smaller monasteries, and distributed the monks into other con∣vents. The
execution of this project became the l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ss difficult for him, that the Romish church began to perceive,
that she over-abounded in monks, and that she wanted some supply of
learning, in order to oppose the inquisitive, or rather disputative,
humour of the new reformers.</P>
<P>THE consederacy against France seemed more formidable than
ever, on the open∣ing this campaign<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Guicciardin, lib
14.</NOTE>. Adrian, before his death, had renewed the league with Charles and
Henry. The Venetians had been induced to desert the French alli∣ance, and to
form engagements for the securing Sforza in possession of the
Mila∣nese. <PB N="130" REF="135"/> The Florentines, the dukes of Ferrara and
Mantua, and all the powers of Italy combined in the same measure. The
emperor in person menaced France with a powerful invasion on the side of
Guienne: The forces of England and the Netherlands seemed ready to break into
Picardy: A numerous body of Ger∣mans were preparing to ravage Burgundy: But all
these perils from foreign ene∣mies were less threatening than a domestic
conspiracy, which had been forming, and which was now come to full maturity
against the French monarch.</P>
<P>CHARLES duke of Bourbon, constable of France, was a prince of
the most shining merit; and, beside distinguishing himself in many
military enterprizes, he was adorned with every accomplishment, which became
a person of his high station. His virtues, embellished with the graces of
youth, had made such im∣pression on Louise of Savoy, Francis's mother,
that, without regard to the in∣equality of their years, she made him
proposals of marriage; and meeting with a refusal, she formed schemes
of unrelenting vengeance against him. She was a woman, false, deceitful,
vindictive, malicious; but, unhappily for France, had by her capacity, which
was considerable, acquired an absolute ascendant over her son. By her
instigation, Francis put many affronts on the constable, which it was
difficult for a gallant spirit to endure; and at last he permitted Louise
to prosecute a lawsuit against him, by which, under the most frivolous
pretences, he was deprived of his ample possessions; and inevitable
ruin was brought upon him.</P>
<P>BOURBON, provoked at all these indignities, and thinking,
that, if any in∣juries could justify a man in rebelling against his prince
and country, he must stand acquitted, had entered into a secret
correspondence with the emperor and the King of England<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Memoires du Bellay, liv. 2.</NOTE>. Francis, pertinacious in his
design of recovering the the Milanese, had proposed to lead his army in
person into Italy; and Bourbon, who feigned sickness, in order to have a
pretence for staying behind, intended, so soon as the King had passed
the Alps, to raise an insurrection among his nu∣merous vassals, by whom
he was extremely beloved, and to introduce foreign enemies into the heart of
the kingdom. Francis got intimation of his design; but not being prompt
enough in securing so dangerous a foe, the constable made his
escape<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Belcarius, lib. 17.</NOTE>; and putting
himself in the emperor's service, did all the injuries to his native
country, which his enterprizing spirit and his great talents for war enabled
him to perform. Charles professed such regard for him, that he promised
him his sister in marriage, Eleonora, widow to Emanuel, King of Portugal;
and when the constable came to Madrid, some time after, the emperor
received him with all the demonstrations of friendship. He said to a
Spanish grandee, that he must <PB N="131" REF="136"/> desire him, while
Bourbon resided in that city, to allow him to take up his re∣sidence in his
house, as most suitable to his rank and quality. The nobleman replied,
with a Castilian dignity, that his majesty's desire was to him a
sufficient reason; but he must tell him beforehand, that so soon as
Bourbon departed he would raze to the ground the house which had been
polluted by the presence of such a traitor<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gulcciardini</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE King of England, desirous that Francis should undertake
his Italian ex∣pedition, did not openly threaten Picardy this year with an
invasion; 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">24th August.</NOTE> and it was late before
the duke of Suffolk, who commanded the English forces, passed over to
Calais. He was attended with the lords Montacute, Herbert, Ferrars, Morney,
Sandys, Berkeley, Powis, and many other noblemen and gentlemen<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Herbert.</NOTE>. The English army, reinforced by
some troops, drawn from the garrison of Calais, amounted to about 12,000
men; 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Invasion of France.</NOTE> and having joined
an equal number of Flemings under the count of Buren, they prepared for an
invasion of France. The siege of Boulogne was first proposed; but that
enterprize appearing difficult, it was thought more adviseable to leave this
town behind them. The frontier of Picardy was very ill provided of troops; and
the only defence of that pro∣vince was the activity of the French officers, who
infested the allied army in their march, and threw garrisons, with great
expedition, into every town, which was threatened by them. After coasting the
Somme, and passing Hedin, Montreuil, Dourlens, the English and Flemings
presented themselves before Bray, a place of small force, which commanded
a bridge over the Somme. Here they were resolved to pass, and, if
possible, to take up winter quarters in France; but Crequi threw himself
into the town, and seemed determined to defend it. The allies attacked him
with vigour and success; and when he retreated over the bridge, they
pursued him so hotly, that they allowed him not time to break it down, but
passed it along with him, and put him to route. They next advanced to
Montdidier, which they besieged and took by capitulation. Meeting with no
opposition, they proceeded to the river Oise, within eleven leagues of
Paris, and threw that city into great consternation; till the duke of Vendome
hastened with some forces to its relief. The confederates, then, afraid of
being surrounded, and reduced to extremities during so advanced a
season, thought proper to retire. Montdidier was abandoned: And the
English and Flemings went each into their own country.</P>
<P>FRANCE defended herself from the other invasions with equal
facility and equal good so tune. Twelve thousand Lansquenets broke into
Burgundy under the command of the count of Fustemberg. The count of Guise,
who defended <PB N="132" REF="137"/> that frontier, had nothing to oppose to
them but some militia, and about nine hundred heavy-armed cavalry. He threw
the militia into the garrison-towns; and with his cavalry, he kept the field,
and so harrassed the Germans, that they were glad to make their retreat
into Lorraine. Guise attacked them as they passed the Meuse, put them
into disorder, and cut off the greatest part of their rear.</P>
<P>THE emperor made great preparations on the side of Navarre;
and, tho' that frontier was well guarded by nature, it seemed now exposed
to great danger from this powerful invasion which threatened it. Charles
besieged Fontarabia, which had fallen a few years before into Francis's
hands; and when he had drawn thither Lautrec, the French general, he raised
the siege of a sudden, and sat down before Bayonne. Lautrec, aware of
that stratagem, made a sudden march and threw himself into Bayonne, which
he defended with such vigour and courage, that the Spaniards were
constrained to raise the siege. The emperor would have been totally
unfortunate on this side, had he not turned back upon Fon∣tarabia, and,
contrary to the advice of all his generals, sat down, in the winter
season, before that city, well fortified and strongly garrisoned. The
cowardice or misconduct of the governor saved him the shame of a new
disappointment. The place was surrendered in a few days; and the emperor,
having finished this enterprize, put his troops into winter quarters.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Italian wars.</NOTE> SO obstinate was
Francis in prosecuting his Italian expedition, that, notwith∣standing
these dangerous invasions, with which his kingdom was menaced on every
side, he had determined to lead in person a powerful army to the conquest
of Milan. The intelligence of Bourbon's revolt and escape stopped him at
Lyons; and fearing some insurrection in the kingdom from the intrigues of a
man so powerful and so beloved, he thought it prudent to remain in France;
and to send for∣ward his army, under the command of admiral Bonnivet. The
dutchy of Milan had been purposely left in a condition somewhat
defenceless, with a view of al∣luring Francis to attack it; and no sooner
had Bonnivet passed the Tesin, than the army of the league, and even
Prosper Colonna, who commanded it, a very prudent general, were in the
utmost confusion. It is agreed, that if Bonnivet had immediately advanced
to Milan, that great city, on which the whole dutchy depends, would have opened
its gates without resistance: But as he wasted his time in frivolous
enterprizes, Colonna had opporunity to reinforce the garrison, and to put the
place in a posture of defence. Bonnivet was now obliged to attempt reducing
the city by blockade and famine; and he took possession of all the
posts, which commanded the passages to it. But the army of the league,
mean-while, was not inactive; and they so straitened and harrassed the
quarters of the French, that it seemed more likely the latter would
themselves perish by famine, than <PB N="133" REF="138"/>
<MILESTONE N="1524" UNIT="year"/> reduce the city to that extremity. Sickness
and fatigue and want had wasted them to such a degree, that they were ready
to raise the blockade; and their only hopes consisted in a great body of
Swiss, which was levied for the service of the French king, and whose
arrival was every day expected.</P>
<P>THE Swiss had in that age so great a superiority in the
field above almost every other nation, and had been so much courted by all
the great potentates of Europe, that they were become extremely capricious and
haughty, and thought that the fate of kingdoms depended entirely on their
assistance or opposition. Francis had promised to this body of
mercenaries, whom he had hired to join Bonnivet, that so soon as they
arrived in the plains of Piedmont, the duke of Longueville should join them
with four hundred lances, and conduct them to the French camp: But by some
accident Longueville's march had been retarded, and the Swiss had been
obliged to march, without the honour of being escorted by him. Offended at
this neglect, as they interpreted it, they no sooner came within sight of
the French camp, than they stopped, and instead of joining Bon∣nivet, they
sent orders to a great body of their countrymen, who then served under him,
immediately to begin their march, and to return home in their company<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Guicciardini, lib. 15. Memoires du Bellay, liv.
2.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>AFTER this desertion of the Swiss, Bonnivet had no other
choice, than that of making his retreat, as fast as possible, into
France. He accordingly put himself in motion for that purpose; but the
allies, who foresaw this measure, were ready to fall upon his rear. The
French army, however, after a sharp action, made good their retreat, tho' not
without considerable loss both in officers and pri∣vate men. Among the
rest, fell in this action the brave chevalier Bayard, esteemed in that age
the model of soldiers and men of honour, and denomi∣nated the <HI>knight
without fear and without reproach.</HI> When this gallant gentleman felt his
wounds to be mortal, and could no longer support himself on horse∣back,
he ordered his attendants to set him under a tree, and turn his face to∣wards
the enemy, that he might die in that posture. The generals of the al∣lies,
and among the rest the duke of Bourbon, came about him, and expressed
their concern for his present condition. 
<Q REND="inline">"Pity not me," cried he to Bourbon; "I die in
the discharge of my duty: They are to be pitied alone, who fight against
their prince and country<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Pere Daniel, vol. 3. p.
152.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>THE French being thus expelled Italy, the pope, the Venetians,
the Flo∣rentines were satisfied with the advantage obtained over them, and
were re∣solved to prosecute their victory no farther. All these powers,
especially Clement, had entertained a violent jealousy of the emperor's
ambition; and <PB N="134" REF="139"/> their jealousy was extremely augmented,
when they saw him refuse the in∣vestiture of Milan, a fief of the empire,
to Francis Sforza, whose title he had acknowledged, and whose defence he
had embraced<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Guicciardini, lib. 15.</NOTE>. They all
concluded, that he intended to put himself in possession of that
important dutchy, and re∣duce Italy to subjection: Clement in particular,
actuated by this jealousy, pro∣ceeded so far in opposition to the
emperor, that he sent orders to his nuncio at London to mediate a
reconciliation between France and England. But affairs were not yet fully ripe
for this change. Wolsey, disgusted with the emperor, but still more
actuated by vain-glory, was determined, that he himself should have the
renown of bringing about that great alteration; and he engaged the King to
reject the pope's mediation. A new treaty was even concluded between Henry and
Charles for the invasion of France. Charles stipulated to supply the duke
of Bourbon with a powerful army, in order to conquer Provence and Dauphiny:
Henry agreed to pay him a hundred thousand crowns for the first month;
after which, he might either chuse to continue the same monthly pay∣ments,
or invade Picardy with a powerful army. Bourbon was to possess these
provinces with the title of King; but to hold them in fief of Henry as King of
France. The dutchy of Burgundy was to be given to Charles: The rest of the
Kingdom to Henry.</P>
<P>THIS chimerical partition immediately failed of execution in the
article, which was most easily performed: Bourbon refused to acknowledge
Henry as King of France. His enterprize, however, against Provence still
took place. A nu∣merous army of imperialists invaded that country under his
command and that of the marquis of Pescara. They laid siege to
Marseilles, which, being weakly garrisoned, they expected to carry in a
little time: But the burgesses defended themselves with such valour and
obstinacy, that Bourbon and Pescara, who heard of the French King's
approach with a numerous army, found themselves under a necessity of
raising the siege; and they led their forces, much weakened, baffled, and
disheartened, into Italy.</P>
<P>FRANCIS might now have enjoyed in safety the glory of
repulsing all his ene∣mies, in every attempt which they had hitherto made of
breaking into his king∣dom: But as he received intelligence, that the King of
England, discouraged with his former fruitless enterprizes, and
disgusted with the emperor, was mak∣ing no preparations for the invasion
of Picardy, his antient ardour seized him for the conquest of Milan; and,
notwithstanding the advanced season, he was immediately determined,
contrary to the advice of his wisest counsellors, to lead his army into
Italy.</P>
<P><PB N="135" REF="140"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King of France n∣vades Italy.</NOTE> HE
passed the Alps at Mount Cenis, and no sooner appeared in Piedmont, than
he threw the whole Milanese into consternation. There was no army in the
field able to oppose him; and Milan itself, tho' affectionate to its duke,
was not in the same posture of defence as last year, when blockaded by
admiral Bonnivet. It was almost wholly destitute of inhabitants: Great
numbers had died of the plague; and the rest had fled into the country for
safety. Francis immediately marched to that city, which opened its gates to
receive him. The forces of the emperor and Sforza fled to Lodi; and had Francis
been so fortunate as to pursue them, they had abandoned that place, and had
been totally dissipated<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Guicciardin, lib. 15. Du
Bellay, lib. 2.</NOTE>. But his ill fate led him to besiege Pavia, a town of
considerable strength, well-garrisoned, and de∣fended by Leyva, one of
the bravest officers in the Spanish service. Every at∣tempt, which the
French king made to gain this important place, proved fruitless. He battered
the walls, and made breaches; but by the vigilance of Leyva, new retrenchments
were instantly thrown up behind the breaches: He attempted to divert the
course of the Tesin, which ran by one side of the city, and defended it;
but an inundation of the river destroyed in one night all the mounds which
the soldiers, during a long time, and with infinite pains, had been erecting.
Fa∣tigue and the bad season (for it was now the depth of winter) had
wasted the French army. <MILESTONE N="1525" UNIT="year"/> And the more to
diminish its force, Francis, at the pope's solli∣citation, who now
declared, almost openly, for him, had detached a considerable body, under
the duke of Albany, to invade the kingdom of Naples. The im∣perial generals
mean while were not idle. Pescara and Lannoy, viceroy of Na∣ples, gathered
forces from all quarters. Bourbon, having pawned his jewels for money, went
into Germany, and by his personal interest, levied twelve thousand
Lansquenets, with which he joined the imperialists. This army was advancing
to raise the siege of Pavia; and the danger to the French became every day
more imminent.</P>
<P>The state of Europe was such, during that age, that, partly
from the want of commerce and industry every where, except in Italy and the
Low Countries, partly from the extensive privileges still possessed
by the people in all the great monarchies, and their frugal maxims in granting
money, the revenues of the princes were extremely narrow, and even the small
armies, which they kept on foot, could not be regularly paid by them. The
imperial forces, commanded by Bourbon, Pescara, and Lannoy, exceeded not
twenty thousand men; they were the only body of troops maintained by the
emperor (for he had not been able to levy any army for the invasion of
France, either on the side of Spain or <PB N="136" REF="141"/> Flanders). Yet
so poor was that mighty monarch, that he could transmit no money for the
payment of this army; and it was chiefly the hopes of sharing the plunder of
the French camp, which had made them advance, and kept them to their
standards. Had Francis raised the siege before their approach, and
retired to Milan, they must immediately have dispe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t themselves; and he had obtained a compleat victory,
without danger or bloodshed. But it was the character of this monarch, to
become obstinate in proportion to the difficulties which he encountered; and
having once said, that he would take Pavia or perish before it, he was
resolved rather to endure the utmost extremities than depart from this
resolution.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">25 February.</NOTE> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Battle of Pa∣via, and cap∣tivity of
Francis.</NOTE> THE imperial generals, after cannonading the French camp for
several days, at last gave a general assault, and broke into the
entrenchments. Leyva sallied from the town, and threw the besiegers into
still greater confusion. The Swiss infantry, contrary to their usual
practice, behaved in a dastardly manner, and de∣serted their post.
Francis's whole army was put to rout, and he himself, sur∣rounded by his
enemies, after fighting with the most heroic valour, and killing seven men
with his own hand, was at last obliged to surrender himself prisoner.
Almost the whole army, full of nobility and brave officers, either perished
by the sword, or were drowned in the river. The few, who escaped with their
lives, fell into the hands of the enemy. The imperial generals had so little
authority over their own troops, even after this signal victory, that Lannoy,
apprehensive left the Lansquenets should seize Francis as security
for the pay due to them, im∣mediately removed him from the camp, and sent him
to Pizzighitone. And taking advantage of the terrors, which had seized the
pope, the Florentines, the Duke of Ferrara, and other Italian states, he
obliged them, tho' secretly ene∣mies, to advance money for the
subsistence of his army.</P>
<P>THE emperor received this news by Pennalosa, who passed
thro' France, by means of a safe-conduct, which he received from the captive
King. The moderation, which he displayed on this occasion, had it been
real, would have done him great honour. Instead of rejoicing, he
expressed sympathy with Francis's ill fortune, and discovered his
sense of those calamities, to which the greatest monarchs are
exposed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vera.
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. de Charle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> V.</NOTE>. He refused the city of
Madrid permission to make any public ex∣pressions of triumph; and
said that he reserved all his exultation till he should be able to obtain
some victory over the infidels. He sent orders to his frontier garrisons
to commit to hostilities upon France. He spoke of concluding immediately a
peace on reasonable terms. But all this seeming equity was only
hypocrisy, so much the more dangerous, that it was profound. And his sole
occupation was <PB N="137" REF="142"/> the forming schemes, how, from this
great incident, he might draw the utmost advantage, and gratify that
exorbitant ambition, by which, in all his actions, he was wholly governed.</P>
<P>THE same Pennalosa, in passing thro' France, carried
also a letter from Fran∣cis to his mother, whom he had left regent, and who
then resided at Lyons. It contained only these few words, <HI>Madam, all is
lost, except our honour.</HI> The princess was struck with the
greatness of the calamity. She saw the kingdom without a sovereign,
without an army, without generals, without money; sur∣rounded on every hand
by implacable and victorious enemies: And her sole re∣source, in her
present distresses, was the hope, which she entertained, of peace and
even of assistance from the King of England.</P>
<P>HAD the King entered into the war against France from any
concerted political views, it is evident, that the victory of Pavia, and the
captivity of Francis, were the most fortunate incidents which could have
befallen him, and the only ones which could render his schemes effectual.
While the war was carried on in the former feeble manner, without any
decisive advantage, he might have been able to possess himself of
some frontier towns, or perhaps of a small territo∣ry, which he could not
keep possession of, without expending much more than its value. By
some great calamity alone, which annihilated the power of France, could he
hope to acquire the dominion of considerable provinces, or dismember that
mighty monarchy, so affectionate to its own government and its own
sovereigns. But as it is probable, that Henry had never before carried his
reflections so far; he was startled at this important event, and became
sensible of his own danger, as well as that of all Europe, from the loss
of a proper counterpoise to the great power of Charles. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Henry em∣braces the al∣liance of
France.</NOTE> Instead of taking advantage, therefore, of the
distressed condition of France, he was determined to lend her his
assistance in her present calamities; and as the glory of generosity,
in raising a fallen enemy, concurred with his political interests, he
hesitated the less in embracing these new measures.</P>
<P>SOME disgusts also had previously taken place between
Charles and Henry, and still more between Charles and Wolsey; and that
powerful minister waited only a fa∣vourable opportunity of revenging the
disappointments, which he had met with. The behaviour of Charles, immediately
after the victory of Pavia, gave him occasion to revive the King's jealousy
and suspicions of his ally. The emperor supported so ill the appearance
of moderation, which he at first assumed, that he had already changed his
usual stile to Henry; and instead of writing to him with his own hand,
and subscribing himself <HI>your affectionate son and cousin;</HI> he
dictated his letters to his secretary, and simply subscribed himself
<HI>Charles</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Guicciardin, lib. 16.</NOTE>.
Wolsey also <PB N="138" REF="143"/> perceived a diminution in the
caresses and professions, with which the emperor's letters to him were
usually loaded, and this last imprudence, proceeding from the intoxication
of success, was probably more dangerous to Charles's interests than the
other.</P>
<P>HENRY, tho' determined to embrace new measures, was careful to
save appear∣ances in the change; and he caused rejoicings to be every where
made on account of the victory of Pavia, and the captivity of Francis. He
publicly dismissed a French envoy, whom he had formerly allowed,
notwithstanding the war, to re∣side at London<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Du Bellay, Liv. 3. Stow. p. 221. Baker, p. 273.</NOTE>: But upon
the regent's submissive applications to him, he again opened a
correspondence with her; and besides assuring her of his friend∣ship
and protection, he exacted a promise, that she never would consent to the
dismembering any province of the monarchy for her son's ransom. With the
emperor, however, he put on the appearance of vigour and enterprize; and in
order to have a pretence for breaking with him, he dispatched Tonstal,
bishop of London, to Madrid, with proposals for a powerful invasion of
France. He required, that Charles should immediately enter Guienne at the
head of a great army, in order to put him in possession of that
province; and he demanded the payment of large sums of money, which that
prince had borrowed from him in his last visit at London. He knew, that the
emperor was in no condition of exe∣cuting either of these conditions; and
that he had as little inclination to make him master of such considerable
territories upon the frontiers of Spain.</P>
<P>TONSTAL likewise informed him, that Charles, on his part,
wanted not com∣plaints against England; and in particular was displeased
with Henry, because last year he had neither continued his monthly payments
to Bourbon, nor invaded Picardy, according to his stipulations; that,
instead of expressing his intentions to espouse Mary, when she
should be marriageable, he had hearkened to proposals, for marrying his
niece Isabella, princess of Portugal; and that he had entered into a
separate treaty with Francis, and seemed determined to reap alone all the
advantages of the success, with which fortune had crowned his arms.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">30 August.</NOTE> THE King, influenced by
all these motives, concluded at Moore his alliance with the regent, and
engaged to procure Francis his liberty on reasonable condi∣tions<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Du Tillet, Recucil des Traites de Leonard, tom. 2.

to be Henry's debtor for one million eight hundred thousand crowns, to be
discharged in half yearly payments of fifty thousand crowns: After which,
Henry was to re∣ceive <PB N="139" REF="144"/> during his own life, a yearly
pension of a hundred thousand crowns▪ Not∣withstanding his
generosity, he could not for bear taking advantage of the cala∣mitous
situation of France, in order to exact this lucrative condition from her. A
large present of a hundred thousand crowns was also made Wolsey, for
his good offices, but covered under the pretence of arrears due on the
pension grant∣ed him for relinquishing the administration of Tournay.</P>
<P>MEANWHILE, as Henry foresaw, that this treaty with France
might involve him in a war with the emperor, he was also determined to fill
his treasury by im∣positions upon his own subjects; and as the parliament
had discovered some re∣luctance in complying with his demands, he followed
the advice of Wolsey, and resolved to make use of his prerogative alone
for that purpose. He issued out commissions to all the counties of
England, for levying four shillings in the pound from the clergy, three
shillings and four pence from the laity; and so un∣controulable did he deem
his authority, that he took no care to cover, as former∣ly, this arbitrary
exaction, even under the slender pretence of a loan. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Discontents of the English.</NOTE> But he
soon found, that he had presumed too far on the passive
submission of his subjects. The people, displeased with an exaction
beyond what was usually levied in those days, but still more
disgusted with the illegal method of imposing it, broke out in murmurs,
complaints, opposition to the commissioners; and their refractory
dis∣position even threatened a general insurrection. Henry had the
prudence to stop short, in that dangerous path, into which he had entered.
He sent letters to all the counties; declaring, that he meant no force by
this last imposition, and that he would take nothing of his subjects but
by way of <HI>benevolence.</HI> He flatter∣ed himself, that his
condescension in employing that disguise would satisfy the people,
and that no one would dare to render himself obnoxious to royal autho∣rity,
by refusing any payment required of him in this manner. But the spirit of
opposition was once roused, and could not so easily be quieted at
pleasure. A lawyer in the city objecting the statute of Richard the third,
by which benevo∣lences were for ever abolished, it was replied by the court,
that Richard being an usurper, and his Parliaments factious assemblies,
his statutes could not bind a law∣ful and <HI>absolute</HI> monarch, who
held his crown by hereditary right, and needed not to court the favour of a
licentious populace<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></NOTE>. The judges even went so
far as to affirm positively, that the King might exact by commission any
sum which he pleased; and the privy council gave a ready assent to this
decree, which anni∣hilated the most valuable privilege of the people, and
rendered all their other privileges precarious. Armed with such formidable
authority, of royal preroga∣tive and a pretext of law, Wolsey sent for the
mayor of London, and desired to <PB N="140" REF="145"/> know what he was
willing to give for the supply of his majesty's necessities. The mayor
seemed desirous, before he should declare himself, to consult the
common council; but the cardinal required, that he and all the aldermen
should separately confer with himself about the benevolence; and he
eluded by that means the danger of formed opposition. Matter, however, went
not so smooth∣ly in the country. An insurrection was begun in some
places; but as the people were not headed by any considerable person, it
was easy for the duke of Suffolk, and the earl of Surrey, now duke of
Norfolk, by employing persuasion and au∣thority, to induce the ringleaders
to lay down their arms, and surrender them∣selves prisoners. The king,
finding it dangerous to punish criminals, engaged in so popular a cause,
was determined, notwithstanding his violent, imperious temper, to grant them
a general pardon; and he very prudently imputed their guilt, not to their want
of loyalty or affection, but to their poverty. The offen∣ders were brought
before the star-chamber; where, after a severe charge laid against them
by the King's council, the cardinal said, 
<Q REND="inline">"That, notwithstanding their grievous
offences, the King, in consideration of their necessities, had granted
them his gracious pardon, upon condition, that they would give in sureties
for their future good behaviour."</Q> But they replying, that they had no
sureties, the cardinal first, and after him the duke of Norfolk, said,
that they would stand bound for them. Upon which they were discharged<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Herbert, Hall, Stow, 525. Hollinshed, p.
891.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THESE arbitrary impositions, being generally imputed to the
cardinal's coun∣sels, increased the general odium, under which he laboured;
and the clemency of the pardon, being ascribed to the King, was considered
as an atonement on his part for the illegality of the measure. But Wolsey,
supported both by royal and papal authority, proceeded, without scruple, to
violate all ecclesiastical privileges, which, during that age, were much
more sacred than civil; and having once pre∣vailed in that unusual attempt
of suppressing some monasteries, he kept all the rest in awe, and
exercised over them the most arbitrary jurisdiction. By his
commis∣sion as legate, he was impowered to visit them, and reform them,
and chastise their irregularities; and he employed his usual agent,
Allen, in the exercise of this authority. The religious houses were obliged
to compound for their guilt, real or pretended, by giving large sums to the
cardinal or his deputy; and this oppression was carried so far, that it
reached at last the King's ears, which were not commonly open to complaints
against his favourite. He reproved Wolsey in severe terms, which rendered
him, if not more innocent, at least more cauti∣ous for the future. That
haughty minister had built a splendid palace at Hamp∣ton court, which he
probably intended, as well as that of York place in West∣minster, 
<PB N="141" REF="146"/> minister, for his own use; but fearing the
increase of envy on account of this magnificence, and desirous to appease
the King, he made him a present of that building, and told him, that, from
the first, he had erected it for his service.</P>
<P>THE absolute authority, possessed by the King,
rendered his domestic go∣vernment, both over his people and his ministers,
easy and expeditious: The conduct of foreign affairs alone required effort
and application; and they were now brought to such a pass, that it was no
longer safe for England to be entirely neutral. The feigned moderation of the
emperor was of very short date; and it was soon obvious to all the world,
that his great dominions, far from gra∣tifying his ambition, were only regarded
as the means of acquiring an empire more extensive. The terms, proposed by
him to his prisoner, were such as must have for ever annihilated the
power of France, and destroyed the ballance of Europe. He required, that that
monarch should restore to him the dutchy of Burgundy, usurped, as he
pretended, by Lewis the eleventh upon his ancestors; that he should yield
Provence and Dauphiny to the duke of Bourbon, to be possessed by him in
full sovereignty, without fief or homage to the crown of France; that he
should satisfy the King of England with regard to the provinces, which that
prince claimed as his inheritance; and that he should re∣nounce all title to
Naples, Milan, Genoa, or any territory in Italy<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Guicciardini, lib. 16.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THESE demands were proposed to Francis, soon after the
battle of Pavia, while he was detained in Pizzighitone; and as he had hitherto
trusted somewhat to the emperor's generosity, the disappointment
excited in his breast the most lively indignation. He said, that he would
rather live and die a prisoner than agree to dismember, his kingdom; and
that, even were he so base as to submit to such terms, his subjects
would never permit him to carry them into execution. The offers which he made
for obtaining his liberty, were, that he would renounce all claims in Italy,
that he would assist the emperor in recovering the territories usurped
upon the empire by the Venetians, that he should relinquish the homage due
by the emperor for Artois and Flanders, that he would marry Eleonora, the
emperor's sister, (for he was now a widower) and acknowledge the dutchy of
Burgundy to be possessed as her dowry; and to be inherited by her
children<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">De Vera Hist. de Charles
V.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>FRANCIS was encouraged to persist in these offers, by the
favourable accounts, which he heard of Henry's dispositions towards him,
and of the alarms which had seized all the chief powers in Italy, upon his
defeat and captivity. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Francis re∣moved to Madrid.</NOTE> He was
uneasy, however, to be so far distant from the emperor with whom he
must treat; and he desired to be removed to Madrid, in hopes that a
personal interview would operate much in his favour, and that Charles, if not
influenced by his ministers, <PB N="142" REF="147"/> might be found
possessed of the same frankness of disposition; by which he
him∣self was distinguished. He was soon convinced of his mistake. The
emperor, under pretence of an assembly of the states at Toledo, kept,
during some time, at a distance from him; and even after they broke up,
delayed his visit to the captive King; feigning a del<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cacy in that particular, as if his company, in the
present situation of affairs, before any terms were agreed on, would be
regarded as an insult upon the royal prisoner. Francis, partly from want of
exercise, partly from reflections on his present melancholy situation,
fell into a languishing illness; which begot apprehensions in Charles,
left the death of his captive should bereave him of all those advantages,
which he proposed to extort from him. He then paid him a visit in the
castle of Madrid; and as he approached the bed in which Francis was laid, the
sick monarch called to him, 
<Q REND="inline">"You come, Sir, to visit your prisoner."</Q>

<Q REND="inline"> "No," replied the emperor, "I come to visit
my brother, and my friend, who shall soon obtain his liberty."</Q> He
soothed his affliction with many speeches of a like nature, which had so
good an effect, that the King daily recovered<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>bert, De V<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ra, Sandoval.</NOTE>; and thenceforth
employed himself in concert∣ing with the ministers of the emperor, the
terms of his treaty.</P>
<P>WHILE this negociation advanced slowly, fortune threw into the
emperor's hands a new opportunity of aggrandizing his dominions in Italy.
Francis Sforza, impatient that his investiture of Milan should so long be
delayed, and that even after it was granted, it should be encumbered with
many exorbitant conditions, had endeavoured to seduce Pescara, the imperial
general, from his fidelity, and to engage him in a conspiracy against his
master. Pescara feigned to enter into the design; but having revealed the
whole contrivance, he received orders to take possession of the
Milanese; and Charles made no secret of his intention to try Sforza and
forfeit his fief, on account of the treason, which he had committed against
his liege-lord and sovereign<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Guicciard<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ni, lib. 16.</NOTE>. This incident
retained the Italian powers in closer union with France; and the emperor, by
grasping too much, found himself in danger of losing all his advantages.
His apprehensions were in∣creased, when he heard, that Francis had sent a
resignation of his crown to the re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ent, and had desired that the dauphin might be crowned King;
orders, which, tho' they were not obeyed, shewed his determined resolution
never to submit to the unreasonable t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rms required of him. The chief difficulty of the treaty was now
reduced to the dutchy of Burgundy; and even that territory, Francis had agreed
to yield, but he still insisted on first recovering his liberty. All
mutual confidence was lost between the princes; and each feared, le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t ad∣vantage <PB N="143" REF="148"/>
should be taken of his simplicity, should he first execute his part of
the treaty.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1526" UNIT="year"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">14 January.</NOTE> AT last the emperor was
willing to relax of his rigour in this particular; and the treaty of Madrid was
signed, by which, it was hoped, an end would be fi∣nally put to the
differences between these two great monarchs. The principal con∣dition was
the restoring of Francis's liberty, and the delivery of his two eldest
sons as hostages to the emperor for the restitution of Burgundy: If any
difficulty should afterwards occur in the execution of this article, with
regard to Burgundy, from the opposition of the states, either of France or
of that pro∣vince, Francis stipulated, that in six weeks time, he should
return to his prison, and remain there till the full performance of the
treaty. There were many other articles in this famous convention, all of them
rigorous and severe to the last de∣gree against the captive monarch; and
Charles discovered evidently his intention of reducing Italy, as well as
France, to subjection and dependence.</P>
<P>MANY of Charles's ministers foresaw, that Francis, however
solemn the oaths, promises, and protestations exacted of him, never would
execute a treaty, which was so disadvantageous, or rat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er ruinous and destructive, to himself, his
poste∣rity, and his country. By putting Burgundy into the emperor's hands, he
gave his powerful enemy an entrance into the heart of the kingdom: By
sacrificing his allies in Italy, he deprived himself of all foreign
assistance; and arming his oppressor with the whole force and riches
of that opulent country, rendered him absolutely irresistable. To these
great views of interest, were added the motives, no less cogent, of
passion and resentment; while Francis, a prince, who piqued himself on
generosity, reflected on the rigor with which he had been treated dur∣ing his
captivity, and the cruel terms which had been exacted of him for the re∣covery
of his freedom. It was also foreseen, that the emulation and rivalship,
which had so long subsisted between these two monarchs, would make
him feel the strongest reluctance on yielding the superiority to an
antagonist, who, by the whole tenor of his conduct, he would be apt to think,
had shown himself <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o little
worthy of that advantage, which fortune, and fortune alone, had put into his
hands. His ministers, his friends, his subjects, his allies, with one
voice, would be sure to suggest to him, that the first object of a
prince, was the pre∣servation of his people; and that the laws of honour,
which with a private man ought to be absolutely supreme, and superior to
all interests, were with a sovereign subordinate to the great duty of
ensuring the safety of his country. Nor could it be imagined, that Francis
would be so romantic in his principles, as not to hea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ken to a casui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ry, which was so plausible in itself, and which so much
flat∣tered <PB N="144" REF="149"/> all the passions, by which, both as a
prince and a man, he was strongly ac∣tuated.</P>
<P>SUCH was the reasoning of several of Charles's ministers,
particularly of Gat∣tinara, his chancellor<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Guicciardini, lib. 16.</NOTE>, who counselled him to treat
Francis with more gene∣rosity, and to give him his liberty on such terms,
as would engage him, not by the feeble band of treaties, but by the more
forcible tye of honour, to a strict and faithful performance. But the
emperor's avidity prevented him from following this wiser and more honourable
council; at the same time, that the prospect of a general combination of
Europe hindered him from detaining Francis in captivity, and taking advantage
of the confusions, which his absence must necessarily oc∣casion in
his kingdom. Still suspicious, however, of the sincerity of his
prisoner, he took an opportunity, before they parted, of asking him,
privately and as a friend, whether he seriously intended to execute the
treaty of Madrid; protest∣ing, that, in all cases, he was firmly determined
to restore him to his liberty, and that the prospect of obtaining this
advantage needed no longer engage him to dissemble. Francis was too well
acquainted with Charles's character to trust to the sincerity of this
protestation; and therefore renewed his assurances of fide∣lity, and a
strict observance of his word. The emperor replied, that Francis was now
his best friend and ally; but if he should afterwards break his
engage∣ments, which he could not suspect, he should think himself
entitled to reproach him with a conduct so base and unworthy: And on
these terms the two monarchs parted.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">18th March.</NOTE> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Francis re∣covers his liberty.</NOTE> FRANCIS,
on entering into his own dominions, delivered his two eldest sons as
hostages into the hands of the Spaniards. He mounted a Turkish horse, and
imme∣diately putting him to the gallop, he waved his hand over his head, and
cried aloud several times, <HI>I am yet a King.</HI> He soon reached
Bayonne, where he was joyfully received by the regent and his whole court. He
immediately wrote to Henry; acknowledging that to his good offices alone he
owed his liberty, and protesting, that he should be entirely governed by
his councils in all transactions with the emperor. When the Spanish envoy
demanded his ratification of the treaty of Madrid, now that he had fully
recovered his liberty, he waved the proposal; under colour, that it was
necessary to assemble previously the States both of France and of
Burgundy, and obtain their consent. The States of Burgundy soon met; and
declaring against the clause, which contained an engagement of alienating
their province, they expressed their resolution of opposing, even by
force of arms, the execution of so ruinous and unjust an article. The
imperial minister then required, that Francis, in conformity to the treaty of
Madrid, <PB N="145" REF="150"/> should now return to his prison; 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">22d May.</NOTE> but the French monarch,
instead of com∣pliance, made public the treaty, which, a little before, he
had secretly con∣cluded at Cognac, against the ambitious schemes and
usurpations of the em∣peror<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Guicciardini, lib.
17.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE pope, the Venetians, and other Italian states, who were
deeply interested in these events, had been held in the most anxious
suspence with regard to the resolutions, which Francis should take,
after the recovery of his liberty; and Clement, who suspected, that that
prince would never execute a treaty so hurtful to his interests, and even
destructive of his independancy, had very frankly of∣fered him a
dispensation from all his oaths and engagements. Francis remained not in
suspence; but entered immediately into the confederacy proposed to him.
It was stipulated, between that King, the pope, the Venetians, the Swiss,
the Florentines, the duke of Milan, among other articles, that they would
oblige the emperor to deliver up the two young princes of France on receiving a
suitable sum of money; and that he would restore Milan to Sforza, without
farther con∣ditions or incumbrances. The King of England was invited to accede,
not only as a contracting party, but also as protector of the holy league,
so it was called: And if Naples should be conquered from the emperor, in
prosecution of this confederacy, it was agreed, that Henry should enjoy a
principality of the yearly revenue of 30,000 ducats: And that cardinal
Wolsey, in consideration of the services, which he had rendered to
christendom, should also, in such an event, be put in
possession of a yearly revenue of 10,000 ducats.</P>
<P>FRANCIS was extremely desirous, that the appearance of this
great confederacy should engage the emperor to relax somewhat of the
extreme rigour of the treaty of Madrid; and while he entertained these hopes,
he was the more remiss in his warlike preparations, nor did he send in due
time reinforcements to his allies in Italy. <MILESTONE N="1527" UNIT="year"/>
Bourbon had got possession of the whole Milanese, of which the
emperor intended to grant him the investiture; and having levied a
considerable army in Germany, he became formidable to all the Italian
potentates; and not the less so, that Charles, destitute of money, had
not been able to remit any pay to the forces. The general was extremely beloved
by his troops; and in order to pre∣vent those mutinies which were ready to
break out every moment, and which their affection alone for him had hitherto
restrained, he led them to Rome, and promised to enrich them by the plunder
of that opulent city. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">6th May.</NOTE> He was himself killed, as he
was planting a ladder to scale the walls; 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sack of Rome.</NOTE> but his soldiers,
rather enraged than discouraged by his death, mounted to the assault with
the utmost valour, and entering the city, sword in hand, exercised all
those brutalities, <PB N="146" REF="151"/> which may be expected from ferocity
excited by resistance, and from insolence which takes place when that
resistance is no more. That renowned city, exposed by her renown alone to
so many calamities, never endured in any age, even from the barbarians, by
whom she was often subdued, such indignities as she was now
constrained to suffer. The unrestrained massacre and pillage, which
continued for several days, were the least ills, to which the unhappy
Romans were ex∣posed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Guicciardiani, lib. 18. Bellay.
Stowe, p. 527.</NOTE>. Whatever was respectable in modesty or sacred in
religion seemed but the more to provoke the insults of the soldiery.
Virgins suffered violation in the arms of their parents, and upon those
very altars, to which they had fled for protection. Aged prelates, after
enduring every indignity, and even every torture, were thrown into dungeons,
and menaced each moment with the most cruel death, in order to engage them to
reveal their secret treasures, or purchase liberty by exorbitant
ransoms. Clement himself, who had trusted for protection to the
sacredness of his character, and neglected to make his escape in time,
was taken captive, and found that his dignity, which procured him no regard
from the Spanish soldiers, did but draw on him the insolent moquery of
the German, who, being generally attached to the Lutheran principles, were
pleased to gratify their animosity by the abasement of the sovereign
pontiff.</P>
<P>WHEN intelligence of this great event was conveyed to the
emperor, that young prince, habituated to hypocrisy, expressed the most
profound sorrow for the suc∣cess of his arms: He put himself and all
his court into mourning: He stopped the rejoicings for the birth of his son
Philip: And knowing that every artifice, however gross, is able, when
seconded by authority, to impose upon the people, he ordered prayers,
during several months, to be put up in all the churches for the Pope's
liberty; an event, which, all men knew, a letter under his hand could in a
moment have procured.</P>
<P>THE concern, expressed by Henry and Francis for the calamity
of their ally, was much more sincere. These two monarchs, a few days before
the sack of Rome, had concluded a treaty<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">30th
April.</NOTE>at Westminster, in which, besides renewing former alliances,
they agreed to send ambassadors to Charles, requiring him to accept of
two millions of crowns as the ransom of the French princes, and to repay the
money, borrowed of Henry; and in case of refusal, the ambassadors,
attended with heralds, were to denounce war against him. This war, it was
agreed to prosecute in the Low Countries, with an army of thirty thousand
in∣fantry and fifteen hundred men at arms, two thirds to be supplied by
Francis, the rest by Henry. And in order to strengthen the alliance between
the princes, it was stipulated, that either Francis or his son, the duke of
Orleans, as should <PB N="147" REF="152"/> afterwards be agreed on, should
espouse the princess Mary, Henry's daughter. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">29th May.</NOTE> No sooner did the monarchs
receive intelligence of Bourbon's enterprize, than they changed, by a new
treaty, the scene of the projected war from the Netherlands to Italy; and
hearing of the pope's captivity, they were farther stimulated to undertake
the war with vigour for the restoring his liberty. Wolsey himself
crossed the seas, in order to have an interview with Francis, and to
concert measures for that purpose; 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">11th July.</NOTE> and he displayed all that
grandeur and magnificence, with which he was intoxicated. He was attended with
a train of a thousand horse. The cardinal of Lorraine, and the chancellor
Alançon, met him at Bou∣logne: Francis himself, besides granting to
that haughty prelate the power of giving in every place, where he came, liberty
to all prisoners, made a journey as far as Amiens to meet him, and even
advanced some miles from the town, the more to honour his reception. It was
here stipulated, that the duke of Orleans should espouse the princess
Mary; and as the emperor seemed to be taking some steps towards
assembling a general council, the two monarchs agreed not to acknow∣ledge
it, but, during the interval of the pope's captivity, to govern the churches in
their dominions, each by his own authority. Wolsey made some attempts to
get his legantine power extended into France, and even into Germany; but
find∣ing his efforts fruitless, he was obliged, tho' with great reluctance,
to desist from these ambitious enterprizes<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Burnet, book 3. coll. 12, 13.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">18th Septem∣ber.</NOTE> THE more to cement
the union between these princes, a new treaty was, some time after,
concluded at London; in which Henry agreed to renounce for ever all claims upon
the crown of France; claims, which might now indeed be esteemed chimerical,
but which often served as a pretence for exciting the un∣wary English to
wage war upon the French monarchy. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">League with France.</NOTE> As a return for
this concession, Francis bound himself and his successors to pay
for ever fifty thousand crowns a year to Henry and his successors; and
that a greater solemnity might be given to this treaty, it was agreed, that
the Parliaments and great nobility of both kingdoms should give their
consent to it. The mareschal Montmorency, accompanied with many persons
of distinction, and attended by a pompous equi∣page, was sent over to
ratify the treaty; and was received at London with all the parade, which
suited the solemnity of the occasion. The terror of the emperor's
greatness had entirely extinguished the antient animosity between the
nations; and Spain, during more than a century, became, tho' a more distant
power, the chief object of jealousy to the English.</P>
<P>THIS appearance of a cordial union between France and England,
tho' it added influence to the joint embassy which they sent to the
emperor, was not <PB N="148" REF="153"/> able to bend that ambitious monarch to
submit entirely to the conditions insisted on by the allies. He departed
indeed from his demand of Burgundy as the ransom of the French princes; but
he required, previously to their recovery of liberty, that Francis should
evacuate Genoa, and all the fortresses held by him in Italy: And he
declared his intention of bringing Sforza to a trial, and confiscating the
dutchy of Milan, on account of his pretended treason. The English and
French he∣ralds, therefore, according to agreement, declared war against him,
and set him at defiance. Charles answered the English herald with
moderation; but to the French, he reproached his master with breach of faith,
remembered him of the private conversation which had passed between them
at Madrid before their se∣paration, and offered to prove by single combat,
that that monarch had acted dishonourably. Francis retaliated this challenge
by giving Charles the lie; and, after demanding security of the field, he
offered to maintain his cause by single combat. Many messages
passed to and fro between them; but tho' both the princes were undoubtedly
brave, the intended duel never took place. The French and Spaniards, during
that age, disputed zealously which of the monarchs incurred the blame of
this failure; but all men of moderation every where la∣mented the power of
fortune, that the prince the more candid, generous, and sincere, should, by
unhappy incidents, have been reduced to that cruel situation, that nothing
but the breach of his word could preserve his people, and that he must ever
after, without being able to make a proper reply, bear to be reproached with
this infidelity by a rival, inferior to him both in honour and in virtue.</P>
<P>BUT tho' this famous challenge between Charles and Francis had
no imme∣diate consequences with regard to these monarchs themselves, it
produced a con∣siderable alteration on the manners of the age. The practice
of challenges and duels, which had been part of the antient barbarous
jurisprudence, which was still preserved on very solemn occasions,
and which was even countenanced by the civil magistrate, began thenceforth to
prevail on the most trivial occasions; and men, on any affront or injury,
thought themselves entitled, or even required in honour, to take private
revenges on their enemies, by vindicating their right in single combat.
These absurd, tho' generous maxims, shed much of the best blood in
christendom during more than two centuries; and notwithstanding the
severity of law, such is the prevailing force of custom, they are far
from being as yet en∣tirely exploded.</P>

papal authority be∣fore the reformation, the marriage of Henry the eighth with
Catherine of Arragon, his brother's widow, had not passed, without much
scruple and difficulty. The prejudices of the people were in general bent
against a conjugal union between such near relations; and the late King,
tho' he had solemnized the espousals, when his son was but twelve years
of age, gave evident proofs of his intention to take afterwards a proper
opportunity of annulling them<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Morison's Apomaxis, p.

enter a protestation against the marriage<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Morison, p. 13. Heylin's Queen Mary, p. 2.</NOTE>; and on his
death-bed he charged him, as his last injunc∣tion, not to finish an

After the King's accession, some members of the Privy Council,
par∣ticularly Warham, the primate, openly declared against the resolution
taken, of compleating the marriage; and tho' Henry's youth and dissipation
kept him, during some time, from entertaining any scruples with regard to
the measure which he had embraced, there happened incidents, sufficient to
rouze his at∣tention, and to inform him of the sentiments, generally
entertained on that sub∣ject. The states of Castile had opposed the
emperor, Charles's, espousals with Mary, Henry's daughter; and among other
objections, had much insisted on the illegitimate birth of the young
princess<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Lord Herbert, Fiddes's life of
Wolsey.</NOTE>. And when the negotiations were afterwards opened with France,
and mention was made of betrothing her to Francis or the duke of Orleans, the
bishop of Tarbe, the French ambassador, <PB N="150" REF="155"/> revived
the same objection<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rymer, XIV. 192, 203. Heylin, p.
3.</NOTE>. But tho' these events naturally raised some doubts in Henry's
mind, there concurred other causes, which tended much to fortify his
remorse, and render his conscience more scrupulous.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The King en∣ters into these
scruples.</NOTE> THE queen was older than the King by no less than six
years; and the decay of her beauty, together with particular infirmities and
diseases, had contributed, notwithstanding her blameless character and
deportment, to render her person unacceptable to him. Tho' she had borne
him several children, they all died in early infancy, except one daughter;
and he was the more struck with this mis∣fortune, that the curse of being
childless is the very threatening, contained in the Mosaical law against
those who espouse their brother's widow. The King was actuated by a
strong desire of having male issue: With a view to that end, it is
believed, more than from desire towards other gratification, he had, a few
years before this period, made addresses to a young lady, Catherine,
daughter of Sir John Blount; and when she bore him a son, he expressed
the highest satisfaction, and immediately created him duke of Richmond. The
suc∣cession of the crown too was a consideration, that occurred to
every one, when∣ever the lawfulness of Henry's marriage was questioned; and
it was apprehended, that, if doubts of Mary's legitimacy concurred with the
weakness of her sex, the King of Scots, the next heir, would certainly
advance his own pretensions, and throw the kingdom into confusion. The
evils, as yet recent, of civil wars and convulsions, arising from a
disputed title, made great impression on the minds of men, and rendered
the people universally desirous of any event, which might obvi∣ate so
irreparable a calamity. And the King was thus impelled, both by his private
passions, and by motives of public interest, to seek the
dissolution of his inauspicious, and, as it was esteemed, unlawful
marriage with Catherine.</P>
<P>HENRY afterwards affirmed, that his scruples of conscience
arose entirely from private reflection; and that on consulting his
confessor, the bishop of Lincoln, he found that prelate possessed
with the same doubts and difficulties. The King himself, being so great a
casuist and a divine, proceeded then to examine the question more
carefully by his own learning and study; and having had recourse to Thomas
of Aquine, he observed that this celebrated doctor, whose authority was
great in the church and absolute with him, had treated of that very case,
and had expressly declared against the lawfulness of such
marriages<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Burnet, Fiddes.</NOTE>. The
pro∣hibitions, said Thomas, contained in Leviticus, and among the rest,
that of marrying a brother's widow, are moral, eternal, and founded on a divine
sanction; and tho' the pope may dispense with the rules of the church,
the laws of God cannot be set aside by any authority less than that which
enacted them. The <PB N="151" REF="156"/> archbishop of Canterbury was next
applied to; and he was required to consult his brethren: All the prelates of
England, except Fisher, bishop of Rochester, declared unanimously,
under their hand and seal, that they deemed the King's marriage unlawful<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. 1. p. 38. Stowe, p. 548.</NOTE>. Wolsey
also fortified the King's scruples<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Le Grand,
vol. 3. p. 46, 166, 168. Saunders. Heylin, p. 4.</NOTE>, partly with a view of
promoting a total breach with the emperor, Catherine's nephew, partly
desirous of connecting the King more closely with Francis, by marrying him
to the dutchess of Alençon, sister to that monarch; and perhaps
too somewhat disgusted with the queen herself, who had reproved him for
certain freedoms, unbefitting his character and station<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. 1. p. 38. Strype, vol. 1. p. 88.</NOTE>. But Henry
was carried forward, tho' per∣haps not at first excited, by a motive more
forcible than even the suggestions of that powerful favourite.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Anne Boleyn.</NOTE> ANNE Boleyn, who lately
appeared at court, had been created maid of honour to the queen; and having had
frequent opportunities of being seen by the King, and of conversing with
him, she had acquired an entire ascendant over his affections. This young
lady, whose grandeur and misfortunes have rendered her so celebrated, was
daughter to Sir Thomas Boleyn, who had been employed by the King in several
embassies, and who was allied to all the principal nobility of the kingdom.
His wife, mother to Anne, was daughter of the duke of Norfolk; his own mother
was daughter of the earl of Ormond; his grandfather Sir Geoffrey Boleyn, who
had been mayor of London, had espoused one of the daughters and co-heirs of
the lord Hastings<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Camden's preface to the life
of Elizabeth. Burnet, vol. 1. p. 44.</NOTE>. Anne herself, tho' then in very
early youth, had been carried over to Paris by the King's sister, when
she espoused Lewis the twelfth of France; and upon the decease of that
monarch, and the return of his dowager into England, Anne, whose
accomplishments even in her tender years were always much admired, was
retained in the service of Claude, queen of France, spouse to Francis;
and after her death, she passed into the family of the dutchess of
Alançon, a princess of singular merit. The exact time, when she
returned to England, is not certainly known; but it was after the King had
entertained doubts with regard to the lawfulness of his mar∣riage with
Catherine; if the account is to be credited, which he himself after∣wards
gave of that transaction. Henry's scruples had made him break off all
conjugal commerce with the queen; but as he still supported an
intercourse of civility and freindship with her, he had occasion, in the
visits, which he paid her, to observe the beauty, the youth, the charms of
Anne Boleyn. Find∣ing the accomplishments of her mind no way inferior to her
exterior graces, he <PB N="152" REF="157"/> even entertained the design of
raising her to the throne; and was the more con∣firmed in this resolution,
when he found that her virtue and modesty prevented all hopes of gratifying
his passion after any other manner. And as every motive of inclination and
policy, seemed thus to concur in making the King desirous of a divorce from
Catherine, and as his prospect of success was inviting, he resolved to
make applications to Clement, and he sent Knight, his secretary, to Rome
for that purpose.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Henry applies to the pope for a
divorce.</NOTE> THAT he might not shock the haughty claims of the pontiff, it
was resolved not to found the application on any general doubts of the papal
power to per∣mit marriage in the nearer degrees of consanguinity; but only to
insist on parti∣cular grounds of invalidity in the bull, which Julius had
granted for the mar∣riage of Henry and Catherine. It was a maxim in the court
of Rome, that, if the pope be surprized into any concession, or grant any
indulgence upon false suggestions, the bull may afterwards be annulled;
and this pretence had usually been employed, wherever one pope had recalled
any deed, executed by any of his predecessors. But Julius's bull, when
examined, afforded plentiful matter of this kind; and any tribunal, favourable
to Henry, needed not want a specious colour for gratifying him in his
applications for a divorce. It was said in the preamble, that the bull had
been granted upon his sollicitation; tho' it was known, that, at that time,
he was below twelve years of age: It was also affirmed, as another motive for
the bull, that the marriage was requisite, in order to preserve peace
between the two crowns; tho' it is certain, that there was not then any ground
or appearance of quarrel between them. These false premises in Julius's
bull, seemed to afford Clement a sufficient reason or pretence for
annulling it, and granting Henry a dispensation for a second
marriage<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Collier, Eccles. Hist. vol. II. p.
25. from the Cott. Lib. Vitell. B. 9.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The pope favourable.</NOTE> BUT tho' the
pretext for this indulgence had been less plausible, the pope was in such
a situation, that he had the strongest motive to embrace every
oppor∣tunity of gratifying the English monarch. He was then a prisoner in
the hands of the emperor, and had no hopes of recovering his liberty on any
reasonable terms, unless by the efforts of the league, which Henry had
formed with Fran∣cis and the Italian powers, in order to oppose the
exorbitant ambition of Charles. When the English Secretary, therefore, made
private applications to him, he received a very favourable answer; and a
dispensation was forthwith promised to be expeded to his master<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. I. p. 47.</NOTE>. Soon after, the march of a
French army into Ita∣ly, under the command of Lautrec, obliged the
imperialists to give Clement his liberty; and he retired to Orvietto, where
the Secretary, with Sir Gregory Cus∣sali, the King's resident at Rome,
renewed their applications to him. They <PB N="153" REF="158"/> found him
still full of high professions of friendship, gratitude, and attachment
to the King; but not so expeditious in granting his request as they
expected. The emperor, who had got intelligence of Henry's application to Rome,
had exacted a promise of the pope, to take no steps in that affair before
he com∣municated them to the imperial ministers; and Clement, confined by
this pro∣mise, and still more overawed by the emperor's forces in Italy,
seemed willing to postpone those concessions desired of him by
Henry. Importuned, however, by the English ministers, he at last put into
their hands a <HI>commission</HI> to Wolsey, as legate, in conjunction
with the archbishop of Canterbury, or any other Eng∣lish prelate, to
examine the validity of the King's marriage, and of Julius's
dis∣pensation<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Rymer, XIV. 237.</NOTE>: He
also granted them a provisional <HI>dispensation</HI> for the King's
mar∣riage with any other person; and promised soon to expede a
<HI>decretal bull,</HI> an∣nulling the marriage with Catherine. But he
represented to them the dangerous consequences, which must ensue to
him, if these concessions should come to the emperor's knowledge; and
he conjured them not to publish those papers, or make any further use of
them, till his affairs were in such a situation as to secure his liberty
and independance. And his secret advice was, whenever they should find the
proper time of opening the scene, that they should prevent all
opposi∣tion, by proceeding immediately to a conclusion, by declaring the
marriage with Catherine invalid, and by Henry's instantly espousing
some other person. Nor would it be so difficult, he said, for himself
to confirm these proceedings, after they were passed, as previously to
render them valid, by his consent and au∣thority<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Collier, from Cott. Lib. Vitell. B. 10.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1528" UNIT="year"/> WHEN Henry received the
commission and dispensation from his ambassadors, and was informed
of the pope's advice, he laid the whole matter before his mi∣nisters, and
asked their opinion in so delicate a situation. The English
counsel∣lors considered the danger of proceeding in the manner pointed out
to them. Should the pope refuse to confirm a deed, which he might justly
call precipitate and irregular, and should he disavow the advice which he
gave in so clandestine a manner, the King would find his second marriage
totally invalidated; any chil∣dren, which it might bring him, declared
illegitimate; and his marriage with Catherine more firmly rivetted than
ever<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. I. p. 51.</NOTE>. And Henry's
apprehensions of the pos∣sibility, or even probability, of such an
event, were much confirmed, when he reflected on the character and situation
of the sovereign pontiff.</P>
<P>CLEMENT the seventh was a prince of excellent judgment,
whenever his timi∣dity, to which he was extremely subject, allowed him to
make full use of those <PB N="154" REF="159"/> talents, and that
penetration, with which he was endowed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Father Paul,
lib. 1▪ Guicciardini.</NOTE>. The captivity, and other misfortunes, which
he had undergone, by entering into a league against Charles, had so
affected his imagination, that he never afterwards exerted himself with
vigour in any public measures, especially if the interests or
inclinations of that potentate stood in opposition to him. The imperial
forces were, at present, powerful in Italy, and might return to the attack of
Rome, which was still de∣fenceless, and exposed to the same calamities
with which it had already been over∣whelmed. And besides these dangers,
Clement found or fancied himself exposed to perils, which threatned,
still more immediately, his person and dignity.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The emperor threatens him.</NOTE> CHARLES,
apprized of the timid disposition of the holy father, threw out perpetual
menaces of summoning a general council; which, he represent∣ed, as
necessary to reform the church, and correct those exorbitant abuses,
which the ambition and avarice of the court of Rome had introduced into every
branch of ecclesiastical administration. The power of Clement himself,
he said, the sovereign pontiff, required limitation; his conduct called
aloud for amend∣ment; and even his title to the throne, which he filled, might
justly be brought in question. That pope had always passed for the
natural son of Julian of Me∣dici, who was of the sovereign family of
Florence; and tho' Leo the tenth, his cousin, had declared him legitimate,
upon a pretended promise of marriage be∣tween his father and mother, few
persons believed that declaration to be founded on any just reason or
authority<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Father Paul, lib. 1.</NOTE>. The canon
law, indeed, had been entirely silent with regard to the promotion of
bastards to the papal throne; but, what was still dangerous, the people had
entertained a violent prepossession, that that stain in the birth of
any person was sufficient to incapacitate him for so holy an office. And
in another point, the canon law was express and positive, that no man,
guilty of simony, could attain that dignity. A severe bull of Julius the
second had added new sanctions to this law, by declaring, that a
simoniacal elec∣tion should not be rendered valid, even by a posterior
consent of the cardinals. But unfortunately Clement had given to cardinal
Colonna a billet, containing promises of advancing that cardinal, in case
he himself should attain the papal dignity by his concurrence: And this
billet, Colonna, who was in entire de∣pendance on the emperor, threatned every
moment to expose to public view<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WHILE Charles terrified the pope with these menaces, he also
allured him by hopes, which were no less prevalent over his affections. At
the time that the em∣peror's forces sacked Rome, and reduced Clement to
captivity, the Florentines, passionate for their ancient liberty, had taken
advantage of his distresses, and re∣volting <PB N="155" REF="160"/>
against the family of Medici, had entirely abolished their authority in
Florence, and re-established the former democracy. The better to protect
them∣selves in their freedom, they had entered into the alliance with France,
England, and Venice, against the emperor; and Clement found, that, by this
interest, the hands of his confederates were tied from assisting him in
the restoration of his fa∣mily; the event, which, of all others, he most
passionately desired. The empe∣ror alone, he knew, was able to effectuate
this purpose; and therefore, what∣ever professions he made of fidelity to
his allies, he was always, on the least glimpse of hope, ready to embrace
every proposal of a cordial reconcilement with that monarch<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Father Paul.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THESE views and interests of the pope were well known in
England; and as the opposition of the emperor was foreseen to Henry's
divorce, both on account of the honour and interests of Catherine, his aunt,
and the obvious motive of distressing an enemy, it was esteemed
dangerous to take any measure of conse∣quence, in expectation of the
subsequent concurrence of a man of Clement's character, whose behaviour
contained always so much duplicity, and who was at present so little at
his own disposal. The safest measure seemed to consist in
pre∣viously engaging him so far, that he could not afterwards recede, and
in making use of his present ambiguity and uncertainty, to extort the
most important con∣cessions from him. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">10 February.</NOTE> For this purpose,
Stephen Gardiner, the cardinal's secretary, and Edward Fox, the King's
almoner, were dispatched to Rome, and were or∣dered to sollicit a
commission from the pope, of such a nature as would oblige him to confirm
the sentence of the commissioners, whatever it was, and disable him, on
any account, to recall the commission, or evoke the cause to Rome<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lord Herbert. Burnet, vol. I. p. 29. in the collect. Le

<P>BUT the same reason which made the King so desirous of
obtaining this conces∣sion, confirmed the pope in the resolution to
refuse it: 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The pope's ambiguous conduct.</NOTE> He was
still determined to keep the door open to an agreement with the emperor, and
made no scruple of sa∣crificing all other considerations to a point which
he esteemed, of all others, the most important to his own security, and
to that of his family. He granted, there∣fore, a new commission, in which
cardinal Campeggio was joined to Wolsey, for the trial of the King's
marriage; but he could not be prevailed on to insert the clauses desired
of him. And though he put into Gardiner's hands a letter, promising not to
recall the present commission; this promise was found, on examination,
to be couched in such ambiguous terms, as left him still the power,
whenever he pleased, of departing from it<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Lord
Herbert, p. 221. Burnet, p. 59.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="156" REF="161"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> obligations to the King; but
his dependence on the pope was so much greater, that he conformed himself
entirely to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of his
holiness▪ and tho' he received his commission in April, he
protracted his de∣parture by so many artificial delays, that it was October
before he arrived in England. The first step which be took, was to exhort
the King to desist from the prosecution of his divorce▪ and finding
that this counsel gave great offence, he said, that his intention was
also to exhort the queen to enter into a convent, and that he thought it his
duty, previously to attempt an amicable composure of all differences<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Herbert, p. 225.</NOTE>. The more to pacify the King, he shewed
to him, as also to the cardinal, the decretal bull, annulling the former
marriage with Catherine; but no entreaties could prevail with him to make any
other of the King's council privy to the secret<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Burnet, p. 58.</NOTE>. In order to atone, in some degree, for
this obstinacy, he expressed to the King and the cardinal, the pope's
great desire of satisfying them in every reasonable demand; and in
particular, he showed, that their request for suppressing some more
monastries, and converting them into cathedrals and bi∣shops sees, had
obtained the consent of his holiness<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol.
XIV. p. 270. Strype, vol. I. p. 110, 111. Appen. No. 28.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1529" UNIT="year"/> THESE ambiguous
circumstances in the behaviour of the pope and the legate, kept the court of
England in suspence, and determined the King to wait with pa∣tience the
issue of such uncertain councils. Fortune meanwhile seemed to promise
him a more sure and expeditious way of extricating himself from his
present difficulties. Clement was seized with a dangerous illness; and
the in∣trigues for electing his successor, began already to take place
among the cardinals. Wolsey, in particular, supported by the interests of
England and France, enter∣tained hopes of mounting the throne of St. Peter<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. I. p. 63.</NOTE>; and it appears, that
if a vacancy had then happened, there was a probability of his reaching that
summit of his ambition. But the pope recovered his health, tho' after
several relapses; and he returned to the same train of false and
deceitful politics, by which he had hi∣therto amused the English court. He
still flattered Henry with professions of the most cordial attachment,
and promised him a sudden and favourable issue of his process: He
still continued his secret negociations with Charles, and persevered in
the resolution of sacrificing all his promises, and all the interests
of the Romish religion, to the elevation of his family. Campeggio, who was
perfectly acquainted with his views and intentions, protracted the decision
by the most artificial de∣lays; and gave Clement full leisure to adjust
all the terms of his treaty with the emperor.</P>
<P><PB N="157" REF="162"/> THE emperor,
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> with the King's extreme
earnestness in this affair, was determined, that he should obtain
success by no other means but by an ap∣plication to him, and by deserting
his alliance with Francis, which had hither<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> supported, against the superior force of Spain, the
tottering state of the French monarchy. He willingly hearkened, therefore, to
the applications of Cathe∣rine, his aunt; and promising her his utmost
protection, exhorted her never to yield to the malice and persecutions of her
enemies. The queen herself was na∣turally of a firm and resolute temper;
and was engaged by every motive to per∣severe in protesting against the
injustice to which she thought herself exposed. The imputation of
incest, which was thrown upon her marriage with Henry, struck her with the
highest indignation: The illegitimacy of her daughter, which seemed a
necessary consequence, gave her the most just concern: The reluctance
of yielding to a rival, who, she believed, had supplanted her in the King's
affections, was a very natural motive. Actuated by all these
considera∣tions, she never ceased solliciting her nephew's
assistance, and earnestly entreating an avocation of the cause to
Rome, where alone, she thought, she could expect justice. And the
emperor, in all his negociations with the pope, made the re∣call of the
commission, which Campeggio and Wolsey exercised in England, a
fundamental article<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Herbert, p. 225. Burnet,
vol. I. p. 69.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">31 May.</NOTE> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Trial of the King's mar∣riage.</NOTE> THE two
legates, meanwhile, opened their court at London, and cited the King and Queen
to appear before it. They both presented themselves; and the King
answered to his name, when called: But the Queen, instead of answering,
rose from her seat, and throwing herself at the King's feet, made a very
pathe∣tic harangue, which her virtue, her dignity, and her misfortunes,
rendered the more affecting. She told him, that she was a stranger in his
dominions, without protection, without council, without assistance;
exposed to all the injustice, which her enemies were pleased to impose
upon her: That she had quitted her native country without other resource,
than her connexions with him and his fa∣mily, and had expected, that, instead
of suffering thence any violence or iniqu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ty, she was assured in them of a safeguard against every
misfortune: That she had been his wife during twenty years, and would here
appeal to himself, whe∣ther her affectionate submission to his will had
not merited other treatment, than to be thus, after so long a time, thrown
from him with so much indignity: That she was conscious—he
himself was assured—that her virgin honour was yet un∣stained,
when he received her into his bed, and that her connections with his brother
had been carried no further than the ceremony of marriage: That their parents,
the Kings of England and Spain, were esteemed the wisest princes 
<PB N="158" REF="163"/> of their time, and had undoubtedly acted by the best
council, when they form∣ed the agreement for that marriage, which was now
represented as so criminal and unnatural: And that she acquiesced in
their judgment, and would not sub∣mit her cause to be tried by a court,
whose dependance on her enemies was too visible, ever to allow her any
hopes of obtaining from them an equitable or im∣partial decision<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. I. p. 73. Hall. Stow, p. 543.</NOTE>. Having spoke
these words, she rose, and making the King a low reverence, she
departed from the court, and never would again appear in it.</P>
<P>AFTER her departure, the King did her the justice to
acknowledge, that she had ever been a dutiful and affectionate wife, and that
the whole tenor of her behaviour had been conformable to the strictest
rules of probity and honour. He only insisted on his own scruples, with
regard to the lawfulness of their mar∣riage; and he explained the origin, the
progress, and the foundation of those doubts, by which he had been so
long and so violently agitated. He acquitted cardinal Wolsey of having any
hand in encouraging his scruples; and he begged a sen∣tence of the court,
conformable to the justice of his cause.</P>
<P>THE legates, after citing the queen anew to appear before them,
declared her <HI>contumacious,</HI> notwithstanding her appeal to Rome; and
then proceeded to the examination of the cause. The first point which came
before them, was, the proof of prince Arthur's consummation of his marriage
with Catherine; and it must be confessed, that no stronger arguments
could reasonably be expected of such a fact after so long an interval.
The age of the prince, who had passed his fif∣teenth year, the good state
of his health, the long time that he had cohabited with his spouse, many of
his expressions to that very purpose; all these circumstances form a
violent presumption, in favour of the King's assertion<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Herbert.</NOTE>. Henry himself, after his brother's death, was
not allowed for some time to bear the title of prince of Wales, in
expectation of her pregnancy: The Spanish ambassador, in order the better
to ensure possession of her jointure, had sent over to Spain,
proofs of the consummation of her marriage<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. II. p. 35.</NOTE>: Julius's bull itself was founded
on the supposition, that Arthur had <HI>perhaps</HI> had knowledge of the
princess: In the very treaty, fixing Henry's marriage, the consummation of
the former marriage with prince Arthur, is acknowledged on both siles<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Ryme<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,
XIII. p. 81.</NOTE>. These particulars were all laid before the court;
accompanied with many reasonings concerning the extent of the pope's
authority, and his power of granting a dispensation to marry within the
prohibited degrees. Campeggio heard these doctrines with great impatience;
and notwithstanding his resolution to protract the cause, he was often
tempted <PB N="159" REF="164"/> to interrupt and silence the King's council,
when they insisted on such disagreeable topics. The trial was spun
out till the 23d of July; and Campeggio chiefly took on him the part of
conducting it. Wolsey, tho' the elder cardinal, per∣mitted him to act as
president of the court; because it was thought, that a trial, managed by an
Italian cardinal, would carry the appearance of greater candour and
impartiality, than if the King's own minister and favourite had pre∣sided
in it. The business now seemed to be drawing near a period; and the King
was every day in expectation of a sentence in his favour; when, to his great
sur∣prize, Campeggio, on a sudden, without any warning, and upon very
frivolous pretences<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. 1. p. 76,
77.</NOTE>, prorogued the court, till the first of October. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The cause evoked to Rome.</NOTE> The
avocation, which came a few days after from Rome, put an end to all the hopes
of suc∣cess, which the King had so long and so anxiously
cherished<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Herbert, p. 254.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>DURING the time, that the trial was carried on before the
legates at London, the emperor had by his ministers earnestly sollicited
Clement to evoke the cause to Rome; and had employed every topic of hope or
terror, which could operate either on the passion or timidity of the
pontiff. The English ambassadors, on the other hand, in conjunction with
the French, had been no less earnest in their applications, that the
legates should be allowed to finish the trial; but, tho' they employed the
same engines of promises and menaces, the objects, which they could set
before the pope, were not so instant nor immediate as those which were
held up to him by the emperor<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. 1. p.
75.</NOTE>. The dread of losing England, and of forti∣fying the Lutherans by
so considerable an accession, made small impression on Clement's
mind, in comparison of the anxiety for his own personal safety, and the
fond desire of restoring the Medici to their dominion in Florence. So
soon, therefore, as he had adjusted all terms with the emperor, he laid
hold of the pretence of justice, which required him, he said, to pay regard
to the queen's appeal; and suspending the commission of the legates, he
evoked the cause to Rome. The legate, Campeggio, had beforehand received
private orders, de∣livered by Campana, to burn the decretal bull, with which he
was entrusted.</P>
<P>WOLSEY had long foreseen this measure as the sure
fore-runner of his own ruin. Tho' he had at first desired, that the King

himself with the utmost assiduity and earnest∣ness to bring the
affair to an happy issue<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Collier, vol. 2. p.
45. Burnet, vol. 1. p. 53.</NOTE>: He was not therefore to be blamed for the
unprosperous event, which the pope's partiality had produced. But he had
sufficient experience of the extreme ardour and impatience of Henry's
tem∣per, who could bear no contradiction, and who was wont, without examination
<PB N="160" REF="165"/> or distinction, to make his ministers answerable
for the issue of those transactions, with which they were entrusted.
Anne Boleyn also, who was prepossessed against him, had imputed to
him the failure of her hopes; and as she was newly re∣turned to court, whence
she had been removed, from a regard to decency, during the trial before the
legates, she had naturally acquired an additional in∣fluence on Henry's mind,
and she served much to fortify his prejudices against the cardinal<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Cavendish, p. 40.</NOTE>. Even the queen and her partizans,
judging of Wolsey by the part which he had openly acted, had expressed
the highest animosity against him; and the most opposite factions
seemed now to combine in the ruin of this haughty minister. The high
opinion itself, which Henry had entertained of the cardinal's capacity,
tended to hasten his downfal; while he imputed the bad success of that
minister's undertakings, not to fortune or mistake, but to the ma∣lignity
or infidelity of his intentions. The blow, however, fell not instantly on his
head. The King, who probably could not justify by any good reason his
alienation from his antient favourite, seems to have remained some time in
suspence; and he received him, if not with all his former kindness, at
least with the appearance of trust and regard.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Wolsey's fall.</NOTE> BUT it is found
almost impossible for a high confidence and affection to receive the
least diminution, without sinking into absolute indifference or even
running into the opposite extreme of hatred and aversion. The King was now
determined to bring on the ruin of the cardinal with a motion almost as
precipitate as he had formerly employed in his elevation. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">18th October.</NOTE> The dukes of Norfolk and
Suffolk were sent to require the great seal from him; and on his
scrupling to deliver it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cavendish, p. 41.</NOTE>,
without a more express warrant, Henry wrote him a letter, upon which it was
surren∣dered, and was delivered by the King to Sir Thomas More, a man, who,
be∣sides the ornaments of an elegant literature, possessed the
highest virtue, inte∣grity and capacity.</P>
<P>WOLSEY was ordered to depart from York Place, a palace which he
had built in London, and which, tho' it really belonged to the see of York,
was seized by Henry, and became afterwards the residence of the Kings of
England, under the title of Whitehall. All his furniture and plate were
converted to the King's use. Their riches and splendour besitted rather a
royal than a private fortune. The walls of his palace were covered with cloth
of gold or cloth of silver: He had a cupboard of plate of massy gold:
There were found a thousand pieces of sine holland belonging to him. All
the rest of his riches and furniture was in pro∣portion; and his opulence was
probably no small inducement to this violent persecution against him.</P>
<P><PB N="161" REF="166"/> THE cardinal was ordered to retire to
Asher, a country seat which he possessed near Hampton-Court. The
world, who had paid him such abject court during his prosperity, now
entirely deserted him, on this fatal reverse of all his fortunes. He
himself was much dejected with the change; and from the same turn of mind,
which had made him be so vainly elated with his grandeur, he felt the blow of
adversity with double rigour<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Strype, vol. 1.
p. 114, 115. App. N<SUP>o</SUP> 31, &amp;c.</NOTE>. The smallest appearance of his
return to favour threw him into transports of joy, unbecoming a man. The King
had seemed willing, during some time, to intermit the blows, which
over∣whelmed him. He granted him his protection, and lest him in
possession of the sees of York and Winchester. He even sent him a
gracious message, accompa∣nied with a ring, as a testimony of his
affection. Wolsey, who was on horse∣back when the messenger met him,
immediately alighted; and throwing himself on his knees in the dirt, received
in that humble posture these marks of his majesty's gracious
disposition towards him<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Stowe, p.
547.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT his enemies, who dreaded his return to court, never ceased
plying the King with accounts of his several offences; and Anne Boleyn in
particular, who bore him no kindness, contributed her endeavours, in
conjunction with her uncle the duke of Norfolk, to exclude him from all hopes
of ever being reinstated in his former authority. He dismissed
therefore his numerous retinue; and as he was a kind and beneficent master,
the separation passed not without a plentiful effusion of tears on both
sides<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Cavendish. Stowe, 549.</NOTE>. The
King's heart, notwithstanding some gleams of kindness, seemed now
totally hardened against his old favourite. He ordered him to be indicted in
the Star Chamber, where a sentence was passed upon him. And not contented
with this severity, he abandoned him to all the rigour of the Parliament,
which now, after a long interval, was again assembled. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">3d November.</NOTE> The house of lords voted
a long charge against Wolsey, consisting of forty-four articles; and
accompanied it with an application to the King for his punishment, and his
removal from all authority. Little opposition was made to this charge in the
upper house: No evidence of any part of it was so much as called for; and
as it consists chiefly of general accusations, it was scarce
susceptible of any<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The first article of the
charge against the cardinal is his procuring the legantine power, which,
however, as it was certainly done with the King's consent and permission,
could be no wise criminal. Many of the other articles also regard the mere
exercise of that power. Some articles impute to him as crimes, particular
actions, which were natural or unavoidable to any man, that was prime
minister with so unlimited an authority; such as receiving first all
letters from the King's ministers abroad, receiving first all visits from
foreign ministers, desiring that all applications should be made thro'
him. He was also accused of naming himself with the King, as if he had
been his fellow, <HI>the King and I:</HI> It is reported that sometimes he
even put his own name before the King's, <HI>ego et rex meus.</HI> But this
mode of expression is justified by the Latin idiom. It is remarkable,
that his whispering in the King's
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ar, knowing himself to be
affected with venereal distempers, is an article against him. Many of the
charges are general and incapable of proof. Lord Herbert goes so far as to
affirm, that no man ever fell from so high a station, who had so few real
crimes objected to him. This opinion is per∣haps too favourable to the cardinal
Yet the refutation of the articles by Cromwel, and their being rejected by a
house of commons even in this arbitrary reign, is almost a demonstration
of Wolsey's innocence. Henry was, no doubt, entirely bent on his
destruction, when, on his failure by a par∣liamentary impeachment, he
attacked him upon the statute of provisors, which afforded him so little
just hold on that minister. For that this indictment was subsequent to
the attack in parliament, ap∣pears by Cavendish's life of Wolsey, Stowe, p.
551, and more certainly by the very articles of im∣peachment themselves.

of commons; where Thomas Cromwel, formerly a servant of the cardinal, and who
had been raised by him from a very low station, defended his unfortunate
patron with such spirit, generosity, and courage, as acquired him great
honour, and laid the foundation of that favour, which he afterwards enjoyed
with the King.</P>
<P>WOLSEY'S enemies, finding that either his innocence or his
caution prevented them from having any just ground of accusing him, had
recourse to a very ex∣traordinary expedient. An indictment was lodged
against him; that, contrary to a statute of Richard the second, commonly
called the statute of provisors, he had procured bulls from Rome,
particularly that investing him with the legan∣tine power, which he had
exercised with very extensive authority. He con∣fessed the indictment,
pleaded ignorance of the statute, and threw himself on the King's mercy. He
was perhaps within reach of the law; but besides that this statute was
fallen altogether into disuse, nothing could be more rigorous and severe
than to impute to him as a crime, what he had openly, during a course of so
many years, practised with the consent and approbation of the King, and the
acquiescence of the Parliament and kingdom. Not to mention, what he always
asserted<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cavendish, page 72.</NOTE>, and what we
can scarce doubt of, that he had obtained the royal licence in the most
formal manner, which, had he not been apprehensive of the dangers attending
any opposition to Henry's lawless will, he might have pleaded in his own
defence before the judges. Sentence, however, was pronounced against him, 
<Q REND="inline">"That he was out of the King's pro∣tection; his
lands and goods forfeited, and that his person might be commit∣ted to
custody."</Q> But this prosecution of Wolsey, tho' it was not
disagreeable to Henry, was carried no farther. He even granted him his pardon
for all of∣fences; restored him part of his plate and furniture; and still
continued, from time to time, to drop expressions of favour and
compassion towards him.</P>
<P><PB N="163" REF="168"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Commence∣ment of the reformation in
England.</NOTE> THE complaints against the usurpations of the
ecclesiastics had been very antient in England, as well as in most other
European kingdoms; and as this topic was now become popular every where, it had
paved the way for the Lu∣theran tenets, and reconciled the people, in some
measure, to the frightful idea of heresy and innovation. The commons,
finding the occasion favourable, passed several bills, restraining
the impositions of the clergy; one for regulating of mortuaries; another
against the exactions for the probates of wills<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">These exactions were quite arbitrary, and had risen to a great
height. A member said in the house, that a thousand m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rks had been exacted from him on that
account. Hall, fol 188. Strype, vol. 1. p. 7<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE>; a third against non-residence and pluralities, and
against churchmen's being farmers of land. But what appeared chiefly
dangerous to the ecclesiastical order, were the severe invectives, thrown
out, almost without opposition, in the house, against the
dissoluteness of the priests, their ambition, their avarice, and their
endless encroachments on the laity. Lord Herbert<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">P. 293.</NOTE>has even preserved the speech of a gentleman of
Grey's-Inn, which is of a very singular nature, and contains such topics as
we should little expect to meet with during that period. The member
insists upon the vast variety of theological opinions, which prevailed in
different nations and ages; the endless inextricable controversies
maintained by the several sects; the impossibility, that any man, much
less the people, could ever know, much less examine, the tenets and
principles of each sect; the necessity of igno∣rance and a suspence
of judgment with regard to all these objects of dispute: And upon the
whole, he infers, that the only religion obligatory on mankind is the belief of
one supreme Being, the author of nature; and the necessity of good
morals, in order to obtain his favour and protection. Such sentiments would
be esteemed latitudinarian, even in our time; and would not be advanced,
without some precaution, in a public assembly. But tho' the first
broaching of religious controversy might encourage the sceptical turn in a
few persons of a studious disposition; the zeal, with which men soon
after attached themselves to their several parties, served effectually to
banish for a long time all such obnoxious liberties.</P>
<P>THE bills for regulating the clergy met with some opposition
in the house of lords. Bishop Fisher in particular imputed th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se measures of the commons to their
want of faith; and to a formed design, derived from heretical and Lutheran
principles, of robbing the church of her patrimony, and overturning the
national religion. The duke of Norfolk reproved the prelate, in very severe,
and even somewhat indecent terms. He told him, that the greatest clerks are
not always the wisest men. But Fisher replied, that he did not remember
any fools in his <PB N="164" REF="169"/> time, that had proved great clerks. The
exceptions taken at the bishop of Rochester's speech stopped not there.
The commons, by the month of Sir Thomas Audley, their speaker, made
complaints to the King of the reflections
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hrown upon them; and the bishop
was obliged to put a move favourable construction on his words<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Parliamentary History, vol. 3. p. 59. Burnet, vol. 2. p.
82.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>HENRY was not displeased, that the court of Rome and the
clergy should be sensible, that they were entirely dependant on him, and
that his Parliament, if he were willing to second their inclinations, were
sufficiently disposed to reduce the power and privileges of the
ecclesiastics. The commons gratified the King in another particular of
moment: They granted him a discharge of all those debts, which he had
contracted since the beginning of his reign: And they grounded this bill,
which occasioned many complaints, on a pretence of the King's great care of
the nation, and of his employing regularly all the money, which he had
borrowed, in the public service. Most of the King's creditors consisted
of friends to the cardinal, who had been engaged by their patron to contribute
to the supply of Henry's demands; and the present courtiers were well
pleased to take the opportunity of mulcting them<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. 1. p. 83.</NOTE>. Several also approved of an
expedient, which, they hoped, would ever after discredit a method of
supply, so irregular and so unparliamentary.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Foreign affairs.</NOTE> THE domestic
transactions of England were at present so interesting to the King,
that they chiefly engaged his attention; and he regarded foreign affairs only
in subordination to them. He had declared war against the emperor; but the
mutual advantages reaped by the commerce between England and the Ne∣therlands
had engaged him to stipulate a neutrality with those provinces; and except
by money contributed to the Italian wars, he had in effect exercised no
hostilities against any of the imperial dominions. A general peace was this
sum∣mer established in Europe. Margaret of Austria and Louise of
Savoy met at Cambray, and settled the terms of pacification between the
French King and the emperor. Charles accepted of two millions of crowns in lieu
of Burgundy; and he delivered up the two princes of France, whom he had
retained as hostages. Henry was so generous to his friend and ally Francis,
that he sent him an ac∣quital of near 600,000 crowns, which that prince owed
him. Francis's Italian confederates were not so well satisfied as the King
with the peace of Cambray: They were there almost wholly abandoned to the
will of the emperor; and seemed to have no other means of security left,
but his equity and moderation. Flo∣rence, after a brave resistance, was
subdued by the imperial arms, and finally deli∣vered over to the dominion of
the family of Medici. The Venetians were better <PB N="165" REF="170"/> treated:
They were only obliged to relinquish some acquisitions, which they had
made on the coast of Naples. Even Francis S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orza obtained the investiture of Milan, and was pardoned all his
past offences. The emperor in person passed over into Italy with a
magnificent train, and received the imperial crown from the hands of the pope
at Bologna. He was but twenty nine years of age; and having already, by his
vigour and capacity, succeeded in every enterprize, and reduced to captivity
the two greatest potentates in Europe, the one spiritual, the other
temporal, he attracted the eyes of all men; and many prognostications were
formed of his growing empire.</P>
<P>BUT tho' Charles seemed to be prosperous on every side,
and the conquest of Mexico and Peru now began to prevent that searcity of
money, under which he had hitherto laboured, he found himself threatened with
difficulties in Germany; and his desire of remedying them was the chief
cause of his granting such mode∣rate conditions to the powers in Italy.
Sultan Solyman, the greatest and most accomplished prince, that ever
sat on the Ottoman throne, had almost entirely subdued Hungary, had
besieged Vienna, and, tho' repulsed, still menaced the hereditary
dominions of the house of Austria with conquest and subjection. The
Lutheran princes in the empire, finding, that liberty of conscience was
denied them, had combined in a league for their own defence at Smalcalde; and
be∣cause they protested against the votes of the imperial diet, they
thenceforth re∣ceived the appellation of <HI>protestants.</HI> Charles had
undertaken to reduce them to obedience; and under pretence of securing the
purity of religion, he had laid a scheme of aggrandizing his own family, by
extending its dominions over all Germany.</P>
<P>THE friendship of Henry was one material circumstance yet
wanting to Charles, in order to render his ambitious projects feasible; and
the King was sufficiently acquainted, that the concurrence of that prince
would at once remove all the difficulties, which lay in the way of his divorce;
that point, which had long been the object of his most earnest wishes.
But besides that the interests of his kingdom seemed to require a
confederacy with France, his haughty spirit could not brook a friendship
imposed on him by constraint; and as he had ever been accustomed to
receive courtship, submission, and sollicitation from the greatest
potentates, he could ill bear that dependance, to which this unhappy affair
seemed to have reduced him. Amidst the anxieties with which he was
agitated, he was often tempted to break off all connexion with the court of
Rome; and tho' he had been educated in a superstitious reverence to the
papal authority, it is likely, that his personal experience of the duplicity
and selfish politics of Cle∣ment, had served much to open his eyes in
that particular. He found his royal <PB N="166" REF="171"/> prerogative firmly
established at home: He observed that his people were in general much
disgusted with clerical usurpations, and disposed to reduce the
powers and privileges of the ecclesiastical order: He knew, that they had
cordially taken part with him in his prosecution of a divorce, and highly
resented that un∣worthy treatment, which, after so many services and
such devoted attachment, he had received from the court of Rome. Anne Boleyn
also could not fail, by her insinuations, to engage him into extremities
with the pope, both as it was the readiest way to her attaining royal
dignity, and as her education in the court of the dutchess of Alançon,
a princess inclined to the reformers, had already disposed her to a
belief of the new doctrines. But notwithstanding all these in∣ducements,
Henry had strong motives still to desire a good agreement with the
sovereign pontiff. He apprehended the danger of such great innovations: He
dreaded the reproach of heresy: He abhorred all connexions with the
Luthe∣rans, the chief opponents of papal power: And having once exerted
himself with such applause, as he imagined, in defence of the Romish
communion, he was ashamed to retract his former opinions, and betray from
passion such a palpable inconsistency. While he was agitated by
these contrary motives, an expedient was proposed, which, as it promised
a solution of all difficulties, was embraced by him with the greatest joy
and satisfaction.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The universi∣ties consulted about the
King's mar∣riage.</NOTE> DR. Thomas Cranmer, a fellow of Jesus-College in
Cambridge, was a man remarkable in that university for his learning, and
still more, for the candour and disinterestedness of his temper. He
fell one evening by accident into com∣pany with Gardiner, now secretary of
state, and Fox the King's almoner; and as the business of the divorce
became the subject of conversation, he observed, that the readiest way
either to quiet Henry's conscience or extort the pope's con∣sent, would be
to consult all the universities of Europe with regard to this con∣troverted
point: If they agreed to approve the King's marriage with Cathe∣rine, his
remorses would naturally cease; if they condemned it, the pope would find
it difficult to resist the sollicitations of so great a monarch,
seconded by the opinion of all the learned men in Christendom<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Fox, p. 1860. 2d edit. Burnet, vol 1. p. 79. Speed, p. 769.
Heylin, p. 5.</NOTE>. When the King was informed of this proposal, he was
delighted with it; and swore, with more alacrity than delicacy, that Cranmer
had got the right sow by the ear: He sent for that di∣vine: Entered into
conversation with him: Conceived a high opinion of his virtue and
understanding: Engaged him to write in defence of the divorce: And
immediately, in prosecution of the scheme proposed, employed his agents
to collect the judgment of all the universities in Europe.</P>
<P><PB N="167" REF="172"/> HAD the question of Henry's marriage
with Catherine been examined by the principles of sound philosophy, exempt
from superstition, it seemed not liable to much difficulty. The natural
reason, why marriage in certain degrees is prohi∣bited by the civil laws, and
condemned by the moral sentiments of all nations, is derived from men's care
to preserve purity of manners; while they reflect, that if a commerce of love
were authorized between the nearest relations, the frequent opportunities of
intimate conversation, especially during early youth, would in∣troduce an
universal dissoluteness and corruption. But as the customs of
coun∣tries vary considerably, and open an intercourse, more or less
restrained, between different families, or between the several members of
the same family, so we find, that the moral precept, varying with its
cause, is susceptible, without any incon∣venience, of very different
latitude in the several ages and nations of the world. The extreme delicacy
of the Greeks, permitted no converse between persons of the two fexes,
except where they lived under the same roof; and even the apartments of a
step-mother, and her daughters, were almost as much shut up against
visits from the husband's sons, as against those from any strangers
or more remote relations: Hence in that nation it was lawful for a man to
marry, not only his niece, but his half▪sister by the father: A
liberty unknown to the Romans, and other nations, where a more open
intercourse was authorised be∣tween the sexes. Reasoning from this
principle, it would appear, that the ordi∣nary commerce of life among great
princes, is so obstructed by ceremony, and numerous attendants, that no ill
consequence would result among them, from the marriage of a brother's
widow; especially if the dispensation of the sove∣reign priest is
previously required, in order to justify what may in common cases be
condemned, and to hinder the precedent from becoming too common and familiar.
And as strong motives of public interest and tranquillity may frequently
require such alliances between the sovereign families, there is less
reason for extending towards them the full rigour of that rule which has
place among individuals<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Even judging of this question
by the scripture, to which the appeal was every moment made, the arguments
for the King's cause appear but lame and imperfect. Marriage in the degree of
affi∣nity which had place between Henry and Catherine, is, indeed, prohibited
in Leviticus; but it is na∣tural to interpret that prohibition as a part of the
Jewish ceremonial or municipal law: And tho' it is there said, in the
conclusion, that the gentile nations, by violating these degrees of
consangu nity, had incurred the divine displeasure, the extension of
this maxim to every precise ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e
before specified, is supposing the scriptures to be composed with a
minute accuracy and precision, to which, we know with certainty, the sacred
penmen did not think proper to confine themselves. The descent of mankind.
from one common father, obliged them in the first generation to matry in the
nearest degrees of con∣sanguinity: Instances of a like nature occur among
the patriarchs: And the marriage of a brother's widow was, in certain cases,
not only permitted, but even enjoined as a positive precept by the
Mo∣saical law. It is in vain to say, that this precept was an exception to
the rule; and an exception con∣fined merely to the Jewish nation. The
inference is still just, that such a marriage can contain no na∣tural or
moral turpitude; otherwise God, who is the author of all purity, would never,
in any case, have enjoined it.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="168" REF="173"/> BUT in opposition to these reasons,
and many more which might be collected, Henry had custom and practice on his
side, the principle by which men are al∣most wholly governed in their
actions and opinions. Marriages with a brother's widow were so unusual,
that no other instance of it could be found in any history or record of any
Christian nation; and tho' the popes were accustomed to dis∣pense with
more essential precepts of morality, and even permitted marriages within
other prohibited degrees, such as those of uncle and niece, the
imagina∣tions of men were not as yet reconciled to this particular exercise
of his authority. <MILESTONE N="1530" UNIT="year"/> Several universities of
Europe, therefore, without hesitation, as well as without interest or
reward<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Herbert. Burnet.</NOTE>, gave verdict in
the King's favour; not only those of France, Paris, Orleans, Bourges,
Tholouse, Angiers, which might be supposed to lie under the influence of
their prince, ally to Henry; but also those of Italy, Ve∣nice, Ferrara,
Padua; even Bologna itself, tho' under the immediate jurisdiction of

alarmed with the progress of Lutheranism, and fearing a defection from the
holy see, scrupled to give their sanction to measures, whose
consequences, they feared, would prove so fatal to the ancient religion:
Their opinion however, conformable to that of the other universities of
Europe, was at last procured; and the King, in order to give weight to all
these authorities, engaged his nobility to write a letter to the pope,
recommending his cause to the holy father, and threatning him with the most
dangerous consequences in case of a denial of justice<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Rymer XIV. 405. Burnet, vol. I. p. 95.</NOTE>. The convocations
too both of Canterbury and York, pro∣nounced the King's marriage invalid,
irregular, and contrary to the law of God, with which no human power had
authority to dispense<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rymer XIV. 454, 472.</NOTE>.
But Clement lying still under the influence of the emperor, continued to
summon the King to ap∣pear, either by himself or proxy, before his tribunal
at Rome; and the King, who knew that he could expect no fair trial there,
refused to submit to such a condition, and would not even admit of any
citation, which he regarded as a high insult, and a violation of his royal
prerogative. The Father of Anne Bo∣leyn, created earl of Wiltshire, carried
to the pope the King's reasons for not <PB N="169" REF="174"/> appearing by
proxy; and as the first instance of disrespect from England, re∣fused
to kiss his holiness's foot, which he very graciously held out to him for
that purpose<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. I. p. 94.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE extremities to which Henry was pushed, both against the
pope and the ecclesiastical order, were naturally very disagreeable to
cardinal Wolsey; and as Henry foresaw his opposition, it is the most
probable reason which can be assigned for his continuing to persecute
with so much rigour his ancient favourite. After Wolsey had remained some
time at Asher, he was allowed to remove to Rich∣mond, a palace which he had
received as a present from Henry, in return for Hampton-Court: But the
courtiers, dreading still his near neighbourhood to the King, procured an
order for him to remove to his see of York. The car∣dinal knew it was vain to
resist: He took up his residence at Cawood in York∣shire, where he
rendered himself extremely popular to the neighbourhood, by his affability
and hospitality<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Cavendish. Stowe, p.
554.</NOTE>: but he was not allowed to remain long un∣molested in this
retreat. The earl of Northumberland received orders, without regard to
Wolsey's ecclesiastical character, to arrest him for high treason,
and to conduct him to London, in order to his trial. The cardinal, partly from
the fatigues of the journey, partly from the agitation of his anxious mind, was
seized with a disorder which turned into a dysentery; and he was able,
with some difficulty, to reach Leicester-abbey. When the abbot and monks
advanced to receive him with much respect and ceremony, he told them, that he
was come to lay his bones among them; and he immediately took his bed, whence
he ne∣ver rose more. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">28 Novemb.</NOTE> A little before he expired,

favourite's measures have undergone; and when we consider, that the
subse∣quent part of Henry's reign was much more unfortunate and criminal
than that which was directed by Wolsey's councils, we shall be inclined to
suspect of par∣tiality those historians, who have endeavoured to load
his memory with such vio∣lent reproaches. If in foreign politics, he
sometimes employed his influence over the King for his private purposes,
rather than his master's interest, which, he boasted, he had solely at
heart; we must remember, that he had in view the papal throne; a dignity,
which, had he attained it, would have enabled him to make Henry a suitable
return for all his favours. The cardinal d'Amboise, whose memory is
precious in France, always made this apology for his own conduct, which was, in
some respects, similar to Wolsey's; and we have reason to think, that
Henry was well acquainted with the motives by which his minister was
in∣fluenced. He regreted very much his death, when informed of it; and always
spoke favourably of his memory: A proof, that humour more than reason, or
any discovery of treachery, had occasioned his last persecutions
against him.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">16 January.</NOTE> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Parliament</NOTE> A NEW session of
Parliament was held, together with a convocation; and the King gave strong
proofs of his extensive authority, as well as of his intention to employ it
to the depression of the Clergy. As an ancient statute, now almost
become obsolete, had been made use of to ruin Wolsey, and render his
exercise of the legantine power criminal, notwithstanding the King's
permission; the same law was now turned against the ecclesiastics.
It was pretended, that every one who had submitted to the legantine
authority, that is, the whole church, had violated the statute of
provisors; and the attorney-general brought accord∣ingly an indictment
against them<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Antiq Brit. Eccles. p. 325. Burnet,
vol. I. p. 106.</NOTE>. The convocation knew that it would be vain to oppose
reason or equity to the King's arbitrary will, or plead that their ruin would
have been the certain consequence of not submitting to Wolsey's
commission, which was procured by Henry's consent, and supported by his
authority. They chose therefore to throw themselves on the mercy of their
sovereign; and they agreed to pay 118,840 l. for their pardon<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Hollingshed, p. 923.</NOTE>. A confession was
likewise extorted from them, that <HI>the King was the protector and the
supreme head of the church and clergy of England;</HI> tho' some of them
had the dexterity to get a clause inserted, which invalidated the whole
submission, and which ran in these terms, <HI>in so far as is
permitted by the law of Christ.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="171" REF="176"/> THE commons, finding that a pardon was
granted the clergy, began to be ap∣prehensive for themselves, lest either
they should afterwards be brought into trouble, on account of their
submission to the legantine court, or a supply be ex∣torted from them,
in return for their pardon. They therefore petitioned the King, to grant a
remission to his lay subjects; but met with a repulse. He told them,
that, if he ever pleased to forgive their offence, it would be from his own
goodness, not from their application, lest he should seem to be
compelled to it. Some time after, when they despaired of obtaining this
concession, he was pleased to issue a pardon to the laity; and the
commons expressed great gratitude for this act of clemency<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Hall's Chronicle. Hollingshed, p. 923. Baker, p.
208.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1532" UNIT="year"/> BY the strict execution of
the statute of provisors, a great part of the profit, and still more of
the power, of the court of Rome was cut off; and the connec∣tions between the
pope and the English clergy were, in some measure, dissolved. The
next session found both King and Parliament in the same
dispositions. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">15 January.</NOTE> An act was passed
against levying the annates or first fruits<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. I. Collect. N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. 41. Strype, vol. I. p. 144.</NOTE>; being a year's rent of all
the bishoprics that fell vacant: 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Progress of the reforma∣tion.</NOTE> A tax
which was imposed by the court of Rome for granting bulls to the new
prelates, and which was found to amount to considerable sums. Since the
second of Henry the seventh, no less than one hundred and sixty
thousand pounds had been transmitted to Rome, on account of this claim;
which the Parliament, therefore, reduced to five per cent. of all the
episcopal benefices. The better to keep the pope in awe, the King was
entrusted with a power of regulating these payments, and of confirming or
infringing this act at his pleasure: And it was voted, that any censures
which should be passed by the court of Rome, on account of that law,
should be entirely disregarded, and that mass should be said, and the
sacraments administered, as if no such censures had been
issued.</P>
<P>THIS session the commons preferred to the King, a long
complaint against the abuses and oppressions of the ecclesiastical
courts; and they were proceeding to enact laws for remedying them, when a
difference arose, which put an end to the session, before the
Parliament had finished all their business. It was be∣come a custom for
men to make such settlements, or trust deeds, of their land by will, that
they defrauded, not only the King, but all other lords, of their wards,
marriages, and reliefs; and by the same artifice the King was de∣prived of
his primier seisin, and the profits of the livery, which were no
in∣considerable branches of the revenue. Henry made a bill be drawn to
mode∣rate, not remedy altogether, this abuse: He was contented, that every
man <PB N="172" REF="177"/> should have the liberty of disposing in this
manner of the half of his land; and he told the Parliament in plain terms, 
<Q REND="inline">"If they would not take a reasonable thing,
when it was offered, he would search out the extremity of the law; and then
would not offer them so much again."</Q> The lords came willingly into his
terms; but the commons rejected the bill: A singular instance, where Henry
might see, that his power and authority, tho' extensive, had yet some
boundaries. The commons, however, found reason to repent of their victory.
The King made good his threats: He called together the judges and ablest
law∣yers, who argued the question in chancery; and it was decided, that a man
could not by law bequeath any part of his lands, in prejudice of his heir<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. I. p. 116. Hall▪ Parliamentary
History.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">10 April.</NOTE> THE Parliament being again
assembled after a short prorogation, the King caused the two oaths to
be read to them, that which the bishops took to the pope, and that to the
King, on their installation; and as a contradiction might be sus∣pected
between them, while the prelates seemed to swear allegiance to two
so∣vereigns<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. I. p. 123,
124.</NOTE>, the Parliament showed their intention of abolishing the oath
to the pope, when their proceedings were suddenly stopped by the breaking
out of the plague at Westminster, which occasioned a prorogation. It is
remarkable, that one Temse ventured this session to move, that the
House should address the King, to take back the queen, and stop the
prosecution of his divorce. This motion occasioned the King to send for
Audley, the Speaker; and to explain to him the scruples with which his
conscience had so long been agitated; scruples, he said, which had
proceeded from no wanton appetite, which had arisen after the fervours of
youth were over, and which were confirmed by the concurring senti∣ments of
all the learned societies in Europe. Except in Spain and Portugal, he added,
it was never heard of, that any man had espoused two sisters; but he
himself had the misfortune, he believed, to be the first christian man
who had ever married his brother's widow<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Herbert. Hall, fol. 205.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>AFTER the prorogation, Sir Thomas More, the chancellor,
foreseeing that all the measures of the King and Parliament tended to a
breach with the church of Rome, and to an alteration of religion, which his
principles would not permit him to concur with, desired leave to resign the
seals; and he descended from this high station with more joy and alacrity
than he had mounted up to it. The austerity of this man's virtue, and the
sanctity of his manners, had no way en∣croached on the gentleness of his
temper, nor even diminished that frolic and gaity to which he was naturally
inclined. He sported with all the varieties of fortune into which he was
thrown; and neither the pride naturally attending a <PB N="173" REF="178"/> high
station, nor the melancholy incident to poverty and retreat, could ever lay
hold of his serene and equal spirit. While his family discovered
symptoms of sorrow on laying down the grandeur and magnificence to which
they had been accustomed, he drew a subject of mirth from their
distresses; and made them ashamed of losing even a moment's
chearfulness, on account of such trivial mis∣fortunes. The King, who had
entertained a high opinion of his virtue, admit∣ted his resignation with
some difficulty; and he bestowed the seals soon after on Sir Thomas
Audley.</P>
<P>DURING these transactions in England, and these
invasions of the papal and ecclesiastical authority, the court of Rome
were not without solicitude; and they entertained very just apprehensions
of losing entirely their authority in Eng∣land; the kingdom, which, of all
others, had long been most devoted to the holy see, and which had yielded
it the most ample revenue. While the im∣perial cardinals pushed Clement to
proceed to extremities against the King, his more moderate and impartial
counsellors represented to him the indignity of his proceedings; that a
great monarch, who had signalized himself, both by his pen and his sword,
in the pope's cause, should be refused a favor, which he de∣manded on
such just grounds, and which had scarce ever before been denied to any
person of his rank and station. Notwithstanding these remonstrances,
the Queen's appeal was received at Rome; the King was cited to appear; and
several con∣sistories were held, to examine the validity of their
marriage. Henry was de∣termined not to send any proxy to plead his cause
before this court: He only dispatched Sir Edward Karne and Dr. Bonner, in
quality of excusators, so they were called, to carry his apology, for not
paying that deference to the papal au∣thority. The prerogative of his crown, he
said, must be sacrificed, if he allow∣ed of appeals from his own kingdom;
and as the question regarded conscience, not power or interest, no proxy
could supply his place, or convey that satisfaction which the dictates of
his own mind could alone confer. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">11 October.</NOTE> In order to support
himself in this measure, and add greater security to his defection from
Rome, he procured an interview with Francis at Boulogne and Calais, where he
renewed his personal friendship, as well as public alliance, with that
monarch, and con∣certed all measures for their mutual defence. He even
employed arguments, by which, he believed, he had persuaded Francis to
imitate his example in withdraw∣ing his obedience from the bishop of Rome,
and administering ecclesiastical af∣fairs without having farther
recourse to that see. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">14 November.</NOTE> And being now fully
determined in his own mind, as well as resolute to stand all
consequences, he privately cele∣brated his marriage with Anne Boleyn, whom he
had created marchioness of Pembroke. Rouland Lee, soon after raised to
the bishopric of Coventry, offi∣ciated <PB N="174" REF="179"/> at the
marriage. The duke of Norfolk, uncle to the new Queen, her fa∣ther, mother, and
brother, together with Dr. Cranmer, were present at the ceremo∣ny<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Herbert, 340, 341.</NOTE>. Anne became pregnant soon after her
marriage; and this event, both gave great joy to the King, and was regarded by
the people as a strong proof of the Queen's former modesty and virtue.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1533" UNIT="year"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">4 February. A Parliament.</NOTE> THE
Parliament was again assembled; and Henry, in conjunction with the great
council of the nation, proceeded still in those gradual and secure
steps, by which they loosened their connections with the see of Rome, and
repressed the usurpations of the Roman pontiff. An act was made against
all appeals to Rome in causes of matrimony, divorces, wills, and other
suits cognizable in ecclesia∣stical courts; appeals esteemed
dishonourable to the kingdom, by subjecting it to a foreign jurisdiction;
and found to be infinitely vexatious, by the expence and the delay of
justice, which necessarily attended them<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">24 Hen. VIII. c. 12.</NOTE>. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">12 April.</NOTE> The more to shew his
disregard to the pope, Henry, finding the new Queen's pregnancy to advance,
publicly owned his marriage; and in order to remove all doubts with regard to
its lawfulness, he prepared measures for declaring, by a formal sentence,
the in∣validity of his former marriage with Catherine: A sentence which ought
natu∣rally to have preceded his espousals of Anne<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Collier, vol. II. p. 31. and Re∣cords, N<SUP>o</SUP>. 8.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE King, notwithstanding his scruples and remorses on
account of his first marriage, had always treated Catherine with respect
and distinction; and he en∣deavoured, by every soft and persuasive art,
to engage her to depart from her ap∣peal to Rome, and her opposition to his
divorce. Finding her obstinate in main∣taining the justice of her cause,
he had totally forborne all visits and intercourse with her; and had
desired her to make choice of any one of his palaces in which she should
please to reside. She had fixed her court for some time at Amphill near
Dunstable; 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">10 May.</NOTE> and it was in this latter town
that Cranmer, now created arch∣bishop of Canterbury, on the death of
Warham<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Bishop Burnet has given us an account
of the number of bulls requisite for Cranmer's installation. By one
bull▪ directed to the King, he is, upon the royal nomination, made
archbishop of Canterbury. By a second, directed to himself, he is made
archbishop. By a third, he is absolved from all censures. A fourth, is to
the suffragans, requiring them to receive and acknowledge him as
archbishop. A fifth to the dean and chapter, to the same purpose. A
sixth to the clergy of Canterbury. A seventh to all the laity in his see.
An eighth to all that held lands of it. By a ninth he was ordained to be
conse∣crated, taking the oath that was in the pontifical. By a tenth bull the
pall was sent him. By an ele∣venth, the archbishop of York, and the
bishop of London, were required to put it on him. These were so many
artifices to draw fees to offices, which the popes had erected, and
disposed of for money. It may be worth observing, that Cranmer, before he
took the oath to the pope, made a protestation, that he did not intend
thereby to restrain himself from any thing that he was bound to, either by
his duty to God, the King, or the country; and that he renounced every thing in
it that was contrary to any of these. This device was the invention of some
casuist, and not very compatible with that strict sincerity, and that
scrupulous conscience, of which Cranmer made profession. Collier, vol.
II. in Coll. N<SUP>o</SUP>. 22. Burnet, vol. I. p. 128, 129.</NOTE>, was appointed to
open his <PB N="175" REF="180"/> court for examining the validity of her
marriage. The near neighbourhood of the place was chosen in order to deprive
her of all plea of ignorance; and as she made no answer to the citation,
neither by herself nor proxy, she was declared <HI>contumacious;</HI> and
the primate proceeded to the examination of the cause. The evidences of
Arthur's consummation of the marriage were produced; the opi∣nions of the
universities were read; together with the judgment pronounced two years
before by the convocations both of Canterbury and York; and after these
preparatory steps, Cranmer proceeded to a sentence, and annulled the King's
marriage with Catherine as unlawful and invalid. By a subsequent
sentence, he ratified the marriage with Anne Boleyn, who soon after was
publicly crowned Queen, with all the pomp and dignity suited to that
ceremony<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Heylin, p. 6.</NOTE>. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">7 September.</NOTE> To compleat the King's
satisfaction, on the conclusion of this intricate and vexatious affair,
she was safely delivered of a daughter, who received the name of Elizabeth,
and who afterwards swayed the scepter with such renown and felicity.
Henry was so much delighted with the birth of this child, that soon after
he conferred on her the title of princess of Wales<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. I. p. 134.</NOTE>; a step somewhat irregular, as
she was only presumptive, not apparent heir of the crown. But he had,
during his former marriage, thought proper to honour his daughter Mary with
that title; and he was determined to bestow on the offspring of his present
marriage, the same marks of distinction, as well as exclude Mary from all
hopes of the succes∣sion. His regard for the new Queen seemed rather to
increase than diminish by his marriage; and all men expected to see the
entire ascendant of one who had mount∣ed a throne, from which her birth had
set her at so great a distance, and who, by a proper mixture of
severity and indulgence, had long managed so intractable a spirit as that
of Henry. In order to efface, as much as possible, all marks of his first
marriage, Lord Mountjoy was sent to the unfortunate and divorced Queen, to
inform her, that she was henceforth to be treated only as princess dowager
of Wales; and all means were employed to make her acquiesce in that
determination. But she continued obstinate in maintaining the validity of
her marriage; and she would admit of no service from any person, who did
not ap∣proach her with the accustomed ceremonial. Henry, forgetting his
wonted ge∣nerosity towards her, employed menaces against such of her
servants as com∣plied <PB N="176" REF="181"/> with her commands in this
particular; but was never able to make her relinquish her title and
pretensions<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Herbert, p. 326. Burnet, vol. 1.
p. 132.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WHEN intelligence was conveyed to Rome of these
transactions, so injurious to the authority and reputation of the holy
see, the conclave were in a rage, and all the cardinals of the imperial
faction urged the pope to proceed to a definitive sentence, and to emit his
spiritual thunders against Henry. But Clement pro∣ceeded no farther than to
declare the nullity of Cranmer's sentence, as well as that of Henry's
second marriage; threatening him with excommunication, if, before the first
of November ensuing, he did not replace every thing in the con∣dition, in
which they formerly stood<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Le Grand, vol. 3. p.
566.</NOTE>. An event had happened, from which the pontiff expected a more
amicable conclusion of the difference, and which hindered him from carrying
matters to extremity against the King.</P>
<P>THE pope had claims upon the dutchy of Ferrara for the
sovereignty of Reg∣gio and Modena<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. 2. p.
133. Guicciardini.</NOTE>; and having submitted his pretensions to the
arbitration of the emperor, he was surprized to find a sentence pronounced
against him. En∣raged at this disappointment, he hearkened to proposals
of amity from Francis; and when that monarch made overtures of marrying the
duke of Orleans, his second son, with Catherine of Medici, niece to the
pope, Clement gladly em∣braced an alliance, by which his family was so much
honoured. An interview was even appointed of the pope and French King at
Marseilles; and Francis, as a common friend, employed his good offices in
mediating an agreement between his new ally and the King of England.</P>
<P>HAD this connexion of France with the see of Rome taken place
a few years sooner, there had been little difficulty in composing the
quarrel with Henry. The King's request was an ordinary one; and the same
plenary power of the pope, which had granted a dispensation for his
espousing Catherine, could easily have annulled the marriage. But in the
progress of the quarrel, the state of affairs was much changed on both
sides. Henry had shaken off much of that reverence with which he had been
early imbued for the apostolical see; and finding, that his subjects of
all ranks had taken part with him, and willingly complied with his movements
for breaking foreign dependance, he had taken a relish for his spiritual
authority, and would scarce, it was apprehended, be induced to renew his
submissions to the Roman pontiff. The pope, on the other hand, ran now a
manifest risque of infringing his authority by a compliance with the King;
and <PB N="177" REF="182"/> as a sentence of divorce could no longer be
rested on nullities in Julius's bull, but would be construed as an
acknowledgment of papa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
usurpations, it was fore∣seen, that the Lutherans would thence take
occasion of triumph, and would persevere more obstinately in their
present principles. But notwithstanding these obstacles, Francis did
not despair of mediating an agreement. He still observed that the King
had some remains of prejudice in favour of the apostolic see, and was
apprehensive of the consequences, which might onsue from too violent
inno∣vations. He saw plainly the interest, that Clement had in preserving
the obedience of England, which was one of the richest jewels in the papal
crown. And he hoped, that these motives on both sides would facilitate a
mutual agreement, and would forward the effects of his good offices.</P>
<P>FRANCIS first prevailed on the pope to promise, that, if the
King would send a proxy to Rome, and thereby submit his cause to the holy
see, he would appoint commissioners to meet at Cambray, and form the
process; and he would imme∣diately afterwards pronounce the sentence of
divorce, required of him. Bellay, bishop of Paris, was next dispatched to
London, and obtained a promise of the King, that he would submit his
cause to the Roman consistory, provided the cardinals of the imperial
faction were excluded from it. <MILESTONE N="1534" UNIT="year"/> The prelate
carried this verbal promise to Rome; and the pope agreed, that, if the King
would sign a written agreement to the same purpose, his demands should
be fully complied with. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">King's final breach with Rome.</NOTE> A day
was appointed for the return of the messengers; and all the world re∣garded
this affair, which had threatened a violent rupture between England and the
Romish church, as drawing towards an amicable conclusion<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Father Paul, lib. 1.</NOTE>. But the greatest affairs often
depend on the most frivolous incidents. The courier, who carried the King's
written promise, was detained beyond the day appointed: News are brought to
Rome that a libel had been published in England against the court of Rome,
and a farce acted before the King in derision of the pope and cardinals<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Father Paul, lib. 1.</NOTE>. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">23d March.</NOTE> The pope and cardinals enter
into the consistory enflamed with anger; and by a precipitate sentence,
the marriage of Henry and Catherine was pronounced valid, and Henry declared to
be excommunicated if he refused to adhere to it. Two days after, the courier
arrived; and Clement, who had been hurried from his usual prudence, found,
that, tho' he repented heartily of this hasty measure, it would be
difficult for him to retract it, or replace affairs on the same footing as
before.</P>
<P>IT is not probable, that the pope, had he conducted himself
with ever so great moderation and temper, could hope, during the life-time of
Henry, to have regained much authority or influence in England. That monarch
was both im∣petuous <PB N="178" REF="183"/> and obstinate in his character;
and having proceeded so far in throwing off the papal yoke, he never could
again have been induced tamely to bend his neck to it. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">15 January.</NOTE> Even at the time, when he
was negotiating a reconcilement with Rome, he either entertained so little
hopes of success, or was so indifferent about the event, that he had
assembled a Parliament; 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Parliament.</NOTE> and continued to enact
laws totally destructive of the papal authority. The people had been prepared
by degrees for this great innovation. Each preceding session had
retrenched some∣thing from the power and profit of the pontiff. Care had been
taken, during some years, to teach the nation, that a general council was
much superior to the pope. But now a bishop preached every Sunday at Paul's
Cross, in order to inculcate the doctrine, that the pope was intitled to no
authority at all be∣yond the bounds of his own diocese<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. 1. p. 144.</NOTE>. The proceedings of the Parliament
showed that they had entirely adopted this opinion; and there is reason to
believe, that the King, after having procured a favourable sentence from
Rome, which would have removed all the doubts with regard to his second
marriage and the succession, might indeed have lived on terms of civility
with the apostolic see, but never would have surrendered to it any
considerable share of his assumed prero∣gative. The nature and
importance of the laws, passed this session, even before news arrived
of the violent resolutions taken at Rome, is sufficient to justify this
opinion.</P>
<P>ALL payments made to the apostolic chamber; all provisions,
bulls, dispensa∣tions, were abolished: Monasteries were subjected to
the visitation and govern∣ment of the King alone: The law for punishing
heretics was moderated; the ordinary was prohibited to imprison or try any
person upon suspicion alone, without presentment by two lawful
witnesses; and it was declared, that to speak against the pope's
authority was no heresy: Bishops were to be appointed, by a
<HI>congè d'elire</HI> from the crown, or in case of the dean and
chapter's refusal, by letters patent; and no recourse was to be had to Rome
for palls, bulls, or pro∣visions: Campeggio and Ghinucci, two Italians, were
deprived of the bishoprics of Salisbury and Worcester, which they had
hitherto enjoyed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Le Neve's Fasti eccles.
Ang.</NOTE>: The law which had been formerly made against paying annates or
first fruits, but which had been left in the King's power to suspend or
inforce, was finally established: And a submission, which was exacted
two years before from the clergy, and which had been obtained with great
difficulty, received this session the sanction of Par∣liament<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">25. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. 8.
c. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE>. In this
submission, the clergy acknowledge, that convocations ought only to be
assembled by the King's authority; they promise to enact no new canons
without his consent; and they agree, that he should appoint thirty-two
commissioners, in order to examine the old canons, and abrogate such as
should <PB N="179" REF="184"/> be found prejudicial to his royal
prerogative<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Collier, vol. 2. p. 69, 70.</NOTE>.
An appeal was also allowed from the bishop's court to the King in
Chancery.</P>
<P>BUT the most important law passed this session, was
that which regulated the succession to the crown: The marriage of the
King with Catherine was declared unlawful, void, and of no effect: The
primate's sentence, annulling it, was ra∣tified: And the marriage with Queen
Anne was established and confirmed. The crown was appointed to descend to
the issue of that marriage, and failing them to the King's heirs for ever.
An oath likewise was ordered to be taken in favour of this succession,
under penalty of imprisonment during the King's pleasure, and forfeiture of
goods and chattels. And all slander against the King, Queen, or their
issue, was subjected to the penalty of misprision of treason. After
these compliances, the Parliament was prorogued; 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">30th March.</NOTE> and those acts, so
contemptuous towards the pope, and so destructive of his authority, were
passed at the very time that Clement pronounced his hasty sentence
against the King. Henry's resentment against Queen Catherine, on account
of her obstinacy, was the reason why he excluded her daughter from all
hopes of succeeding to the crown; con∣trary to his first intention, when he
began the suit of divorce, and of dispensa∣tion for a second
marriage.</P>
<P>THE King found his ecclesiastical subjects as compliant as
the laity. The con∣vocation ordered, that the act against appeals to Rome,
together with the King's appeal from the pope to a general council, should be
affixed to the doors of all the churches in the kingdom: And they voted, that
the bishop of Rome had, by the law of God, no more jurisdiction in England
than any other foreign bishop; and that the authority, which he and his
predecessors had exercised there, was only by usurpation and the
sufferance of English princes. Four persons only opposed this vote in
the lower house, and one doubted. It passed unanimously in the upper.
The bishops went so far in their complaisance, that they took out new
commissions from the crown, where all their spiritual and episcopal
authority was expressly affirmed to be derived ultimately from the civil
magistrate, and to be entirely dependent on his good pleasure<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Collier's Eccl. Hist. vol. 2.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE oath regarding the succession was generally sworn
throughout the king∣dom. Fisher, bishop of Rochester, and Sir Thomas
More, were the only per∣sons of note, who entertained scruples with regard
to its legality. Fisher was obnoxious on account of some practices, into
which his credulity, rather than any bad intentions, seems to have betrayed
him. But More was the person of greatest reputation in the kingdom for
virtue and integrity; and as it was be∣lieved, <PB N="180" REF="185"/> that his
authority would have influence on the sentiments of others, great pains were
taken to convince him of the lawfulness of the oath. He declared, that he had
no scruple with regard to the succession, and thought that the
Par∣liament had full power to settle it: He offered to draw an oath
himself, which would assure his allegiance to the heir appointed; but he
refused the oath pre∣scribed by law; because the preamble of that oath
asserted the legality of the King's marriage with Anne, and thereby
implied, that his former marriage with Catherine was unlawful and invalid.
Cranmer, the primate, and Cromwel, now secretary of state, who highly loved
and esteemed More, earnestly sollicited him to lay aside his
scruples; and their friendly entreaties seemed to weigh more with him, than
all the penalties attending his refusal<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol.
1. p. 156.</NOTE>. He persisted however, in a mild, tho' firm manner, to
maintain his resolution; and the King, irritated against him as well as
Fisher, ordered them both to be indicted upon the slatute, and committed
prisoners to the Tower.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">3d Novem∣ber.</NOTE> THE Parliament, being
again assembled, conferred on the King the title of the only supreme
<HI>head</HI> on earth of the church of England; as they had already invested
him with all the real power belonging to it. In this memorable act, the
Parliament granted him power, or rather acknowledged his inherent power, 
<Q REND="inline">"to visit, and repress, redress, reform,
order, correct, restrain, or amend all errors, heresies, abuses,
offences, contempts and enormities, which fell under any spiritual authority
or jurisdiction<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">26 H. 8. c. 1.</NOTE>."</Q>
They also declared it treason to attempt, imagine, or speak evil
against the King, Queen, or his heirs, or to endeavour the depriving them of
their dignities or titles. They gave him a right to all the annates and tythes
of benefices, which had formerly been paid to the court of Rome. They granted
him a subsidy and a fifteenth. They attainted More and Fisher for
misprision of treason. And they united England and Wales together, by
giving to that principality all the benefit of the English laws.</P>
<P>THUS the authority of the popes, like all exorbitant power, was
ruined by the excess of its acquisitions, and by stretching its
pretensions beyond what it was pos∣sible for any human principles or
prepossessions to sustain. The right of granting indulgences had in
former ages contributed extremely to enrich the holy see; but being openly
abused, served to excite the first commotions and oppositions in
Germany. The prerogative of granting dispensations had also contributed
much to attach all the sovereign princes and great families in Europe to the
papal authority; but meeting with an unlucky concurrence of circumstances,
was now the cause, why England separated herself from the Romish
communion. The acknowledgment of the King's supremacy introduced there a
greater simplicity into <PB N="181" REF="186"/> the government, by uniting the
spiritual with the civil power, and preventing dis∣putes about limits,
which never could be exactly determined between the con∣tending parties. A way
was also prepared for checking the exorbitancy of su∣perstition, and
breaking those shakles, by which all human reason, policy, and industry
had so long been incumbered. The prince, it may be supposed, being head
of the religion, as well as of the temporal jurisdiction of the kingdom, tho'
he might sometimes employ the former as an engine of government, had no
interest, like the Roman pontiff, in nourishing its excessive growth;
and, ex∣cept when blinded by ignorance or bigotry, would be sure to retain it
within tolerable limits, and prevent its abuses. And on the whole, there
followed from these revolutions very beneficial consequences; tho' perhaps
neither foreseen nor intended by the persons who had the chief hand in
conducting them.</P>
<P>WHILE Henry proceeded with so much order and tranquillity in
changing the antient religion, and while his authority seemed entirely
secure in Eng∣land, he was held in some inquietude by the state of
affairs in Ireland and in Scotland.</P>
<P>THE earl of Kildare was deputy of Ireland, under the duke of
Richmond, the King's natural son, who bore the title of lieutenant; and as
Kildare was accused of some violences against the family of Ossory,
his hereditary enemy, he was called over to answer for his conduct. He left
his authority in the hands of his son, who hearing that his father was thrown
into prison, and was in danger of his life, immediately took up arms, and
joining himself to Oneale, Ocarrol, and other Irish nobility, committed
many ravages, murdered Allen, archbishop of Dublin, and laid siege to that
city. Old Kildare mean-while died in prison, and his son, persevering in
his revolt, made applications to the em∣peror, who promised him
assistance. The King was obliged to send over some forces to Ireland,
which so harrassed the rebels, that Kildare, finding the emperor backward
in fulfilling his promises, was reduced to the necessity of
surrendering himself prisoner to lord Leonard Gray, the new deputy,
brother to the marquis of Dorset. He was sent over to England, together
with his five uncles; and after trial and conviction, they were all brought to
public justice; tho' two of the uncles, in order to save the family, had
pretended to join the King's party.</P>
<P>THE earl of Angus had acquired the entire ascendant in
Scotland, and hav∣ing got possession of the King's person, then in
early youth, he was able, by means of that advantage, and by employing the
power of his own family, to retain the reins of government. The queen dowager,
however, his spouse, bred him great disturbance: For having separated
herself from him, on account of some jealousies and disgusts, and
having procured a divorce, she had married <PB N="182" REF="187"/> another man
of quality of the name of Stuart; and she joined all the discon∣tented
nobility, who opposed Angus's authority. James himself was dissatisfied
with the slavery, to which he was reduced; and by secret correspondence,
he excited first Walter Scot, then the earl of Lenox, to attempt, by force of
arms, to free him from the hands of Angus. Both enterprizes failed of
success; but James, impatient of restraint, found means at last of
flying to Stirling, where his mother then resided; and having summoned all
the nobility to attend him, he overturned the authority of the Douglasses,
and obliged Angus and his brother to fly into England, where they were
protected by Henry. The King of Scotland, being now arrived at years of
majority, took the government into his own hands; and employed himself with
great spirit and valour, in repressing those feuds, ravages, and
disorders, which, tho' they disturbed the course of public justice,
served to support the martial spirit of the Scotch, and contributed, by
that means, to maintain national independancy. He was desirous of renew∣ing
the antient league with the French nation; but finding Francis in close union
with England, and on that account somewhat cold in hearkening to his
pro∣posals, he received the more favourably the advances of the emperor, who
hoped, by means of such an ally, to breed disturbance to England. He
offered the Scotch King the choice of three princesses, his near relations,
and all of the name of Mary; his sister the dowager of Hungary, his niece a
daughter of Portugal, or his cousin, the daughter of Henry; whom he pretended
to dis∣pose of unknown to her father. James was more inclined to the latter
proposal, had it not, upon reflection, been found impracticable; and his
natural propensity to France at last prevailed over all other
considerations. The alliance with Francis necessarily engaged James to
agree to terms of peace with England. But tho' invited by his uncle, Henry, to
confer with him at Newcastle, and con∣cert common measures for
repressing the ecclesiastics in both kingdoms, and shaking off the
yoke of Rome, he could not be prevailed with to put himself in the King's
power. In order to have a pretext for refusing the conference, he applied to
the pope, and obtained a brief, forbidding him to engage in any per∣sonal
negotiations with an enemy of the holy see. By these measures, Henry
easily concluded, that he could very little depend on the friendship of his
nephew. But those events took not place till some time after our present
period.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Religious principles of the people.</NOTE>
THE antient and almost uninterrupted opposition of interest between the
laity and clergy in England, and between the English Clergy and the court of
Rome, had sufficiently prepared the nation for a breach with the Roman
pontiff; and men had penetration enough to discover abuses, which were
plainly calculated for the temporal advantages of the hierarchy, and which they
found destructive of their own. These subjects seemed proportioned to
human under∣standing; and even the people, who felt the power of intere<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t in their own breasts, could
perceive the purpose of those numerous inventions, which the in∣terested
spirit of the sovereign pontiff had introduced into religion. But when the
reformers proceeded thence to dispute concerning the nature of the
sacra∣ments, the operations of grace, the terms of acceptance with the
dei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y, men were thrown into
amazement, and were, during some time, at a loss how to chuse their
party. The profound ignorance, in which both the clergy and laity formerly
lived, and their freedom from theological altercations, had produced a
sincere, but indolent acquiescence in received opinions; and the multitude
were neither attached to them by topics of reasoning, nor by those
prejudices and antipathies against opponents, which have ever a more natural
and powerful influence over them. As soon as a new opinion therefore was
advanced, sup∣ported by such an authority as to call up their attention,
they felt their capacity totally unfitted for such disquisitions; and
they perpetually fluctuated between the contending parties. Hence the sudden
and violent movements by which the <PB N="184" REF="189"/> people were agitated,
even in the most opposite directions: Hence their seeming prostitution
in sacrificing to present power the most sacred principles: And hence
the rapid progress during some time, and the sudden as well as entire
check given afterwards to the new doctrines. When men were once settled in
their particular sects, and had fortified themselves in a habitual
detestation against those esteemed heretics, they adhered with more
obstinacy to the principles of their education; and the limits of the two
religions remained thenceforth fixed and unchangeable.</P>
<P>NOTHING forwarded more the first progress of the reformers,
than the offer, which they made, of submitting all religious doctrines to
private judgment, and the summons given every one to examine the principles
formerly imposed upon him. Tho' the multitude were totally unqualified for
this undertaking, they yet were highly pleased with it. They fancied that
they were exercising their judg∣ment; while they opposed to the prejudices
of ancient authority more powerful prejudices of another kind. The novelty
itself of the doctrines; the pleasure of an imaginary triumph in dispute;
the fervent zeal of the reformed preachers; their patience, and even alacrity,
in suffering persecution, death, and torments; a disgust against the
restraints of the old religion; an indignation against the tyranny and
interested spirit of the ecclesiastics; these motives were prevalent
with the people, and by such considerations were men so generally induced
during that age, to throw off the religion of their ancestors.</P>
<P>BUT in proportion as the practice of submitting religion to
private judgment was acceptable to the people, it appeared, in some
respects, dangerous to the rights of sovereigns, and seemed to destroy
that implicit obedience on which the authority of the civil magistrate is
chiefly founded. The very precedent of shak∣ing such an ancient and deep
founded establishment as that of the Roman hierar∣chy might, it was
apprehended, prepare the way for new innovations. The re∣publican spirit,
which naturally took place among the reformers, increased this jealousy.
The furious insurrections of the populace, excited by Muncer and other
anabaptists in Germany<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sleidan, lib. 4. &amp;
5.</NOTE>, furnished a new pretence for decrying the re∣formation. Nor
should we conclude, because protestants in our time prove as dutiful
subjects as those of any other religion, that therefore such
apprehensions were altogether without any appearance or plausibility. Tho'
the liberty of pri∣vate judgment be tendered to the disciples of the
reformation, it is not in reality accepted of; and men are generally contented
to acquiesce in those establishments, however new, into which their
early education has thrown them.</P>
<P>NO prince in Europe was possessed of such absolute
authority as Henry, not even the pope himself, in his own capital, where he
united both the civil and <PB N="185" REF="190"/> ecclesiastical powers<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Here are the terms in which the King's minister
expressed himself to the pope. An non, inquam, sanctitas vestra
plerosque habet quibuscum arcanum aliquid crediderit, putet id non minus
celatum esse quam si uno tantum pectore contineretur; quod multo magis

113. The King once said publicly before the council, that if any one spoke
of him or his actions, in terms which became them not, he would let them know,
that he was master. Et qu'il n▪y auroit si belle tete qu'il ne fit
voler. Id. p. 218.</NOTE>; and there was small likelihood, that any doctrine,
which lay under the imputation of encouraging sedition, could ever pretend to
his fa∣vour and countenance. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the King.</NOTE> But besides this
political jealousy, there was another reason which inspired this
imperious monarch with an aversion to the reformers. He had early declared
his sentiments against Luther; and having entered the lists in those
scholastic quarrels, he had received, from his courtiers and theologians,
infinite applause for his performance. Elated by this imaginary success,
and blinded by a natural arrogance and obstinacy of temper, he had
entertained the most lofty opinion of his own erudition, and he received with
impatience, mixed with contempt, any contradiction to his sentiments. Luther
also had been so imprudent, as to treat in a very indecent manner his royal
antagonist; and tho' he afterwards made the humblest submissions to
Henry, and apologized for the vehemence of his former expressions, he never
could efface the hatred which the King had conceived against him and his
doctrines. The idea of heresy still appear∣ed detestable as well as
formidable to that prince; and whilst his resentment against the see of
Rome had removed one considerable part of his early prejudices, he had made
it a point of honour never to relinquish the rest. Separate as he stood
from the catholic church, and from the Roman pontiff, the head of it, he
still valued himself on maintaining the catholic doctrine, and on guarding,
by fire and sword, the imagined purity of his speculative principles.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the mini∣sters.</NOTE> HENRY'S
ministers and courtiers were of as motley a character as his conduct; and
seemed to waver, during this whole reign, between the ancient and the new
religion. The Queen, engaged by interest as well as inclination, favoured the
cause of the reformers: Cromwel, who was created secretary of state, and
who was every day advancing in the King's confidence, had embraced the same
views; and as he was a man of prudence and ability, he was able, very
effectually, tho' in a covert manner, to promote the late innovations: Cranmer,
archbishop of Canterbury, had secretly adopted the protestant tenets; and
he had gained Henry's friendship by his candour and sincerity; virtues
which he possessed in as eminent a degree as those times, equally
distracted with faction and oppressed with tyran∣ny, could easily
permit. On the other hand, the duke of Norfolk adhered to <PB N="186" REF="191"/> the ancient faith; and by the greatness of his rank, as well as by
his talents, both for peace and war, he had great weight in the King's council:
Gardiner, lately created bishop of Winchester, had inlisted himself in
the same party; and the suppleness of his character, as well as the
dexterity of his conduct, had ren∣dered him extremely useful to it.</P>
<P>ALL these ministers, while they stood in the most
irreconcilable opposition of principles, were obliged to disguise their
particular opinions, and to pretend an entire agreement with the sentiments
of their master. Cromwel and Cranmer still carried the appearance of a
conformity to the ancient speculative tenets; but they artfully made use of
Henry's resentment to widen the breach with the see of Rome. Norfolk and
Gardiner feigned an assent to the King's supremacy, and to his
renounciation of the sovereign pontiff; but they encouraged his passion
for the catholic faith, and instigated him to punish those daring
heretics, who had presumed to reject his theological principles. Both sides
hoped, by their unli∣mited compliance, to bring him over to their party: The
King mean while, who held the ballance between the factions, was enabled, by
the courtship payed him both by protestants and catholics, to assume an
immeasurable authority: And tho' in all these measures he was really
driven by his ungoverned humour, he casually held a course, which led more
certainly to arbitrary power, than any which the most profound politics could
have traced out to him. Artifice, refinement, and hypocrisy, in his
situation, would have put both parties on their guard against him, and
would have taught them reserve in complying with a monarch, whom they could
never hope thoroughly to have gained: But while the frankness, sincerity,
and openness of Henry's temper were generally known, as well as the dominion
of his furious passions; each side dreaded to lose him by the
smallest opposition, and flattered themselves that a blind compliance
with his will, would throw him, cordially and fully, into their
interests.</P>
<P>THE ambiguity of the King's conduct, tho' it kept the courtiers
in awe, serv∣ed to encourage the protestant doctrine among his subjects,
and promoted that spirit of innovation with which the age was generally
seized, and which nothing but an entire uniformity, as well as a steddy
severity in the administration, could be able to repress. There were
some Englishmen, Tindal, Joye, Constantine, and others, who, dreading the
exertion of the King's authority, had fled to Ant∣werp<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. I. p. 159.</NOTE>; where the great privileges
possessed by the Low Country provinces, served, during some time,
to give them protection. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Farther pro∣gress of the reformation.</NOTE>
These men employed them∣selves in writing books, in English, against
the corruptions of the church of Rome; against images, relicts, pilgrimages;
and they excited the curiosity of <PB N="187" REF="192"/> men with regard to
that question, the most important in theology, the terms of acceptance with
the Supreme Being. In conformity to the Lutherans and other protestants, they
asserted, that salvation was obtained by faith alone; and that the most
infallible road to perdition<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sacrilegium est &amp;

works;</HI> by which terms they understood, as well the moral duties, as the
ceremonial and monastic observances. The defenders of the ancient religion,
on the other hand, main∣tained the efficacy of <HI>good works;</HI> but tho'
they did not exclude from this appel∣lation the social virtues, it was
still the superstitions, gainful to the church, which they chiefly
extolled and recommended. The books, composed by these fugi∣tives, being
stole over to England, began to make converts every where; but it was a
translation of the scriptures by Tindal, that was esteemed most
dangerous to the established faith. The first edition of this work,
composed with little ac∣curacy, was found liable to considerable
objections; and Tindal, who was poor, and could not afford to lose a great
part of the impression, was longing for an op∣portunity of correcting his
errors, of which he had been made sensible. Ton∣stal, then bishop of
London, soon after of Durham, a man of great modera∣tion, being desirous to
discourage, in the gentlest manner, these innovations, gave private
orders for buying up all the copies, which could be found at Antwerp; and he
burnt them publicly in Cheapside. By this contrivance, he supplied Tin∣dal
with money, enabled him to print a new and correct edition of his work, and
gave occasion to great scandal and reproach, in thus committing to the
flames the word of God<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Hall, fol. 186. Fox, vol.
I. p. 138. Burnet, vol. I. p. 159.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE disciples of the reformation met with little severity
during the ministry of Wolsey, who, tho' himself a clergyman, bore too
small regard to the ecclesi∣astical order, to serve as an instrument
of their tyranny: It was even an article of impeachment against him<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Articles of impeach∣ment in Herbert. Burnet.</NOTE>,
that by his connivance he had encouraged the growth of heresy, and that he
had protected and acquitted some notorious offend∣ers. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sir Thomas More.</NOTE> Sir Thomas More, who
succeeded Wolsey as chancellor, is at once an ob∣ject deserving our
compassion, and an instance of the usual progress of men's
sen∣timents during that age. This man, whose elegant genius and familiar
acquaint∣ance with the noble spirit of antiquity, had given him very enlarged
sentiments, and who had in his early years advanced principles, which even at
present would <PB N="188" REF="193"/> be esteemed somewhat libertine, had,
in the course of events, been so irritated by polemics, and thrown into
such a superstitious attachment to the ancient faith, that few
inquisitors have been guilty of greater violence in their prosecutions of
heresy. Tho' adorned with the gentlest manners, and the purest integrity,
he carried to the utmost height his aversion to heterodoxy; and one James
Bain∣ham, in particular, a gentleman of the temple, experienced from him the
high∣est severity. Bainham, accused of favouring the new opinions, was
carried to More's house, and having refused to discover his accomplices,
the chancellor or∣dered him to be whipt in his presence, and afterwards
sent him to the Tower, where he himself saw him put to the torture. The
unhappy gentleman, over∣come by all these severities, abjured his opinions;
but feeling afterwards the deepest compunction for this apostacy, he openly
returned to his former tenets, and even courted the crown of martyrdom. He was
condemned as an obstinate and relapsed heretic, and was burned in
Smithfield<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Fox. Burnet, vol. I. p. 165.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>MANY were brought into the bishops courts for offences, which
appear very trivial, but which were regarded as symbols of the party: Some
for teaching their children the Lord's prayer in English; others for reading
the new testa∣ment in that language, or for speaking against pilgrimages.
To harbour the persecuted preachers, to neglect the fasts of the church, to
declaim against the vices of the clergy, were capital offences. One Thomas
Bilney, a priest, who had embraced the new doctrine, had been terrified into
an abjuration; but was so haunted by remorse, that his friends dreaded
some fatal effects of his despair. At last, his mind seemed to be more
composed; but this appearing calm pro∣ceeded only from the resolution which
he had taken, of expiating his past offence, by an open confession of the
truth, and by dying a martyr to it. He went thro' Norfolk, teaching every where
the people to beware of idolatry, and of trusting either to pilgrimages, or
to the cowle of St. Francis, to the prayers of the saints, or to images. He
was soon seized, tried in the bishop's court, and condemn∣ed as a
relapse; and the writ was sent down to burn him. When brought to the
stake, he discovered such patience, fortitude, and devotion, that the
specta∣tors were much affected with the horrors of his punishment; and
some mendi∣cant friars, who were present, fearing that his death would be
imputed to them, and make them lose those alms, which they received from
the charity of the peo∣ple, desired him publicly to acquit them<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 164.</NOTE>of having any hand in his death.
He very willingly complied; and by this meekness gained the more on the
sympa∣shy of the people. Another person, still more heroic, being brought
to the stake for denying the real presence, seemed almost in a
transport of joy; and he <PB N="189" REF="194"/> tenderly embraced the
faggots, which were to be the instruments of his punish∣ment, as the means
of procuring him eternal rest. In short, the tide turning towards the new
doctrine, those severe executions, which, in another disposition of
men's minds, would have sufficed to suppress it, now served only the
more to diffuse it among the people, and to inspire them with horror
against the unre∣lenting persecutors.</P>
<P>BUT tho' Henry neglected not to punish the protestant
doctrine, which he esteemed heresy, his most formidable enemies, he knew,
were the zealous ad∣herents to the ancient religion, chiefly the monks, who,
having their immediate dependance on the Roman pontiff, apprehended their own
ruin to be the cer∣tain consequence of abolishing his authority in England.
Peyto, a friar, preach∣ing before the King, had the assurance to tell him, 
<Q REND="inline">"That many lying prophets had deceived him, but
he, as a true Micajah, warned him, that the dogs would lick his blood, as they
had done Ahab's<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Strype, vol. I. p.
167.</NOTE>."</Q> The King took no notice of this insult; but allowed the
preacher to depart in peace. Next Sunday, he employed Dr. Corren to preach
before him; who justified the King's proceed∣ings, and gave Peyto the
appellations of a rebel, a slanderer, a dog, and a tray∣tor. Elston,
another friar of the same house, interrupted the preacher; and told him,
that he was one of the lying prophets, who sought by adultery to
establish the succession to the crown; but that he himself would
justify all that Peyto had said. Henry silenced this petulant friar; but
showed no other mark of resent∣ment than ordering Peyto and him to be
summoned before the council, and to be rebuked for their offence<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Collier, vol. II. p. 86. Burnet, vol. I. p.
151.</NOTE>. He even bore patiently some new instances of their obstinacy
and arrogance. For when the earl of Essex, a privy counsellor, told them,
that they deserved for their offence to be thrown into the Thames; Elston
replied, that the road to heaven lay as near by water as by land<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Stow, p. 562.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT several monks were detected in a conspiracy, which, as
it might have proved more dangerous to the King, was attended with more fatal
consequences to themselves. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Maid of Kent.</NOTE> Elizabeth Barton, of
Aldington in Kent, commonly called the <HI>holy Maid of Kent,</HI> had been
subject to hysterical fits, which threw her body into unusual
convulsions; and having produced an equal disorder in her mind, made her
utter strange sayings, which, as she was scarce conscious of them
during the time, had soon after entirely escaped her memory. The silly
people in the neighbourhood were struck with these appearances, which they
imagined to be supernatural; and Richard Masters, vicar of the parish, a
designing fellow, <PB N="190" REF="195"/> founded on them a project, by which
he hoped to draw both profit and considera∣tion to himself. He went to
Warham, Archbishop of Canterbury, who was at that time alive; and having
given him an account of Elizabeth's revelations, he so far wrought on that
prudent, but superstitious prelate, as to receive orders from him to watch
her in her-trances, and to note down carefully all her future speeches. The
regard paid her by a person of so high a rank, soon rendered her still
more the object of attention to the neighbourhood; and it was easy for
Masters to persuade them, as well as the maid herself, that her ravings
were inspirations of the Holy Ghost. Knavery, as is usual, soon after
succeeding to illusion, she learned to counterfeit trances; and she
then uttered, in an unusual tone of voice, such speeches as were dictated
to her by her spiritual director. Masters associated with him Dr.
Bocking, a canon of Canterbury; and their design was to raise the credit of
an image of the virgin, which stood in a chapel belonging to Ma∣sters, and
to draw such pilgrimages to it as usually frequented the more famous images
and relicts. In prosecution of this design, Elizabeth pretended
revela∣tions, which directed her to have recourse to that image for a cure;
and being brought before it, in the presence of a great multitude, she fell
anew into convul∣sions; and after distorting her limbs and countenance
during a competent time, she affected to have obtained a perfect recovery by
the intercession of the virgin<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Stowe, p. 570.
Blanquet's Epitome of chronicles.</NOTE>. This miracle was soon bruited
abroad; and the two priests, finding the impos∣ture to succeed beyond
their own expectations, began to extend their views, and to lay the foundation
of more important enterprizes. They taught their peni∣tent to declaim against
the new doctrines, which she denominated heresy; against innovations in
ecclesiastical government; and against the King's divorce from Catherine.
She went so far as to assert, that, if he prosecuted that design, and
married another, he would not be a King a month longer, and would not an hour
longer possess the favour of the Almighty, but should die the death of
a villain. Many monks throughout England, either from folly, or roguery, or
from faction, which is often a complication of both, entered into this
delusion; and one Deering, a friar, wrote a book of the revelations and
prophecies of Eli∣zabeth<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Strype, vol I. p.
181.</NOTE>. Miracles were daily added, to encrease the wonder; and the
pulpit every where resounded with accounts of the sanctity and
inspirations of this new prophetess. Messages were carried from her to
Queen Catherine, by which that princess was exhorted to persist in her
opposition to the divorce; the pope's am∣bassadors gave encouragement to
the popular credulity; and even Fisher, bishop of Rochester, tho' a man
of sense and learning, was carried away with an opinion 
<PB N="191" REF="196"/> so favourable to the party, which he had embraced<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Collier, vol. II. p. 87.</NOTE>. The King at last
began to think the matter worthy of his attention; and having ordered Elizabeth
and her accomplices to be arrested, he brought them before the
star-chamber, where they freely, without being put to the torture, made
confession of their guilt. The Parliament, in the session held the
beginning of this year, passed an act of at∣tainder against some who
were engaged in this treasonable imposture<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">25 Hen.
VIII. c. 12. Burnet, vol. I. p. 149. Hall, fol. 220.</NOTE>; and Elizabeth
herself, Masters, Bocking, Deering, Rich, Risby, Gold, suffered for
their crime. The bishop of Rochester, Abel, Addison, Laurence, and some
others, were condemned for misprision of treason; because they had not
discovered some cri∣minal speeches which they heard from Elizabeth<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Godwin's Annals, p. 53.</NOTE>: And they were thrown into
prison. The better to undeceive the multitude, the forgery of many of the
pro∣phetess's miracles was detected; and even the scandalous prostitution
of her man∣ners was laid open to the public. Those passions, which so
naturally insinuate themselves amidst the warm intimacies maintained by
the devotees of different sexes, had taken place between Elizabeth and her
confederates; and it was found, that a door to her dormitory, which was said
to have been miraculously opened, in order to give her access to the
chapel, for the sake of frequent converse with heaven, had been contrived
by Bocking and Masters for less refined purposes.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1535" UNIT="year"/> THE detection of an
imposture, attended with so many odious circumstances, hurt much the
credit of the ecclesiastics, particularly of the monks, and instigated
the King to take vengeance on them. He suppressed three monasteries of
the Observantine friars; and finding that little clamor was excited by this
act of power, he was the more encouraged to lay his rapacious hands on the
rest. Mean∣while, he exercised punishment on individuals, who were
obnoxious to him. The Parliament had made it treason to endeavour the
depriving the King of his dignity or titles: They had lately added to his other
titles, that of supreme head of the church: It was inferred, that to deny his
supremacy was treason; and many priors and ecclesiastics lost their
lives for this new species of crime. It was certainly a high instance of
tyranny to make the mere delivery of a political opi∣nion, especially one
that no way affected the King's temporal right, to be a capi∣tal offence, tho'
attended with no overt act; and the Parliament, in passing this law, had
overlooked all the principles by which a civilized, much more a free people,
should be governed: But the violence of changing so suddenly the whole
system of government, and the making it treason to deny what, during many
ages, it had been heresy to assert, is an event which may appear
somewhat extra∣ordinary. Even the stern, unrelenting mind of Henry was, at
first, shocked <PB N="192" REF="197"/> with these sanguinary measures;
and he went so far as to change his garb and dress, pretending sorrow for
the necessity, by which he was pushed to such extremi∣ties. Still
impelled, however, by his violent temper, and desirous of striking a terror
into the whole nation, he proceeded, by making examples of Fisher and More,
to consummate his lawless tyranny.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Trial and ex∣ecution of Fisher, bi∣shop
of Ro∣chester.</NOTE> JOHN Fisher, bishop of Rochester, was a prelate,
eminent for his learning and morals, no less than for his ecclesiastical
dignities, and for the high favour which he had long possessed with the
King. When he was thrown into prison, on account of his refusing the oath
of succession, and his concealment of Elizabeth Barton's treasonable
speeches, he had not only been deprived of all his revenues, but stripped
of his very cloaths, and, without consideration of his extreme age, was
allowed nothing but rags, which scarce sufficed to cover his
nakedness<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Fuller's Church Hist. book 5. p.
203.</NOTE>. In this condition, he lay in prison above a twelvemonth; when
the pope, wil∣ling to recompense the sufferings of so faithful an
adherent, created him a cardi∣nal; tho' Fisher was so careless of that
dignity, that even if the purple were lying on the ground, he declared that he
would not stoop to take it. This pro∣motion of a man, merely for his
opposition to royal authority, rouzed the in∣dignation of the King; and he
resolved to make the innocent person feel the effects of his resentment. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">22d of June.</NOTE> Fisher was indicted for
denying the King's supremacy, was tried, condemned, and beheaded.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Of Sir Tho∣mas More.</NOTE> THE execution of
this prelate was intended as a warning to More, whose com∣pliance, on account
of his great authority both abroad and at home, and his high reputation for
learning and virtue, was anxiously desired by the King. That prince also
bore as great personal affection and regard to More, as his im∣perious mind,
the sport of passions, was sus<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eptible of towards a man, who in any particular, opposed his
violent inclinations. But More could never be pre∣vailed on, contrary to his
principles, to acknowledge the King's supremacy; and tho' Henry exacted that
compliance from the whole nation, there was, as yet, no law obliging any one to
take an oath to that purpose. Rich, the sollicitor general, was sent to
confer with More, then a prisoner, who kept a cautious silence with regard
to the supremacy: He was only inveigled to say, that any question with
regard to the law, which established that prerogative, was like a two-edged
sword: If a person answer one way, it will confound his soul; if
ano∣ther, it will destroy his body. No more was wanted to found an indictment
of high treason against the prisoner. His silence was called malicious,
and made a part of his crime; and these words, which had casually dropped
from him, <PB N="193" REF="198"/> were interpreted as a denial of the
supremacy<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">More's Life of Sir Thomas More. Herbert, p.
393.</NOTE>. Trials were mere formalities during this reign: The jury gave
sentence against More, who had long expected this fate, and who needed no
preparation to fortify him against the terrors of death. Not only his
constancy, but even his cheerfulness, nay, his usual face∣tiousness,
never forsook him; and he made a sacrifice of his life to his integrity
with the same indifference that he maintained in any ordinary occurrence.
When he was mounting the scaffold, he said to one, 
<Q REND="inline">"Friend, help me up, and when I go down again
let me shift for myself."</Q> The executioner asking him for∣giveness,
he granted the request, but told him, 
<Q REND="inline">"You will never get credit by beheading me, my
neck is so short."</Q> Then laying his head on the block, he bid the
executioner stay till he put aside his beard: 
<Q REND="inline">"For," said he, "it never com∣mitted
treason."</Q> Nothing was wanting to the glory of this end, except a better
cause, more free from weakness and superstition. But as the man
followed his principles and sense of duty, however misguided, his
constancy and integrity are equally objects of our admiration. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">6th July.</NOTE> He was beheaded in the
fifty-third year of his age.</P>
<P>WHEN the execution of Fisher and More was reported at Rome,
especially that of the former, who was invested with the dignity of
cardinal, every one dis∣covered the most violent rage against the King;
and numerous libels were pub∣lished, by the wits and orators of Italy,
comparing him to Caligula, Nero, Do∣mitian, and all the most unrelenting
tyrants of antiquity. Clement the seventh had died about six months after
he pronounced sentence against the King; and Paul the third, of the name of
Farnese, had succeeded to the papal throne. This pontiff, who had always
favoured Henry's cause while a cardinal, had hoped, that, personal
animosities being buried with his predecessors, it might not be
impossible to form an agreement with England: And Henry himself was so
desirous of accommodating matters, that in a negotiation, which he entered
into with Francis a little before this time, he required, that that monarch
should con∣ciliate a friendship between him and the court of Rome. But
Henry was ac∣customed to prescribe, not to receive terms; and even while he
was negotiating peace, his usual violence often carried him to commit
offences, which rendered the quarrel totally incurable. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">30th August.</NOTE> The execution of
Fisher was regarded by Paul, as so capital an injury, that he immediately
passed censures against the King, citing him and all his adherents to
appear in Rome within ninety days, in order to answer for their crimes: 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">King excom∣municated.</NOTE> If they failed,
he excommunicated them; deprived the King of his realm; subjected the kingdom
to an interdict; declared his issue by Anne Boleyn illegitimate;
dissolved all leagues with him; gave his king∣dom to any invader; commanded
the nobility to take arms against him; freed <PB N="194" REF="199"/> his
subjects from all oaths of allegiance; cut off their commerce with foreign
states; and declared it lawful for any one to seize them, to make slaves
of their persons, and to convert their effects to their own use<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sanders, p. 148.</NOTE>. But tho' these cen∣sures were
passed, they were not at that time openly denounced: The pope delayed the
publication, till he should find an agreement with England entirely
desperate; and till the emperor, who was at present pressed by the
Turks and the prote∣stant princes in Germany, should be in a condition to
execute the censures.</P>
<P>THE King knew, that he might expect any injury, which it
should be in Charles's power to inflict; and he therefore made it the chief
object of his policy to incapacitate that monarch from wreaking his
resentment upon him<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Herbert, p. 350,
351.</NOTE>. He renewed his friendship with Francis, and opened negotiations
for marrying his infant-daughter, Elizabeth, with the duke of Angouleme, third
son of Francis. These two princes also made advances to the protestant
league in Germany, who were ever jealous of the emperor's ambition: And Henry,
besides remit∣ing them some money, sent Fox, bishop of Hereford, as
Francis did Bellay, lord of Langey, to treat with those princes. But during
the first fervours of the reformation, an agreement in theological tenets was
held, as well as an union of interest, to be essential to a good
correspondence among states; and tho' both Francis and Henry flattered the
German princes with hopes of their embracing the confession of Ausbourg,
it was looked upon as a bad symptom of their sincerity, that they
exercised such extreme rigour against all preachers of the reformation in
their respective dominions<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Sleidan, lib.
10.</NOTE>. Henry carried the feint so far, that, while he thought himself
the first theologian in the world, he yet invited over Melancthon, Bucer,
Sturmius, Draco, and other German divines, in order to confer with him, and to
instruct him in the foundation of their tenets. These theologi∣ans were now
of great importance in the world; and no poet or philosopher, even in antient
Greece, where they were treated with most respect, had ever reached equal
applause and admiration with these wretched composers of meta∣physical
polemics. The German princes told the King, that they could not spare their
divines; and as Henry had no hopes of agreement with such zealous
disputants, and knew that in Germany the followers of Luther would not
asso∣ciate with the disciples of Zuinglius, because, tho' they agreed
in every thing else, they differed in some particulars with regard to the
eucharist, he was the more indifferent on account of this refusal. He could
also fores<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, that even while
the league of Smalcalde did not act in concert with him, they would always be
carried by their interest to oppose the emperor: And the hatred between
Francis <PB N="195" REF="200"/> and that monarch was so inveterate, that he
esteemed himself sure of a sincere ally in one or other of these
potentates.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1536" UNIT="year"/> DURING these negotiations an
incident happened in England, which promised a more amicable conclusion of
these disputes, and seemed even to open a way for a reconcilement between
Henry and Charles. Queen Catherine was seized with a lingering illness,
which at last brought her to her grave: She died at<NOTE PLACE="marg">6th
January.</NOTE>Kimbolton in the county of Huntingdon, in the fiftieth year of
her age. A<NOTE PLACE="marg">Death of Queen Cathe∣rine.</NOTE>little before
she expired, she wrote a very tender letter to the King; where she gave
him the appellation of <HI>her most dear Lord, King, and Husband.</HI> She
told him, that as the hour of her death was now approaching, she laid hold of
this last opportunity to inculcate on him the importance of his religious
duty, and the comparative emptiness of all human grandeur and enjoyment: That
tho' his fondness towards these perishing advantages had thrown her into
many calamities, as well as created to himself much trouble, she yet
forgave him all past in∣juries, and hoped that this pardon would be ratified
in heaven: And that she had no other request to make, but to recommend to
him his daughter, the sole pledge of their loves, and to crave his protection
for her maids and servants. She con∣cluded with these words, <HI>I make
this vow, that mine eyes desire you above all things</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Herbert, p. 403.</NOTE>. The King was touched, even to the
shedding of tears, by this last tender proof of Catherine's affection; but
Queen Anne is said to have ex∣pressed her joy for the death of a rival
beyond what decency or humanity could permit<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. 1. p 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>2.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE emperor thought, that as the decease of his aunt had
removed all foun∣dation for personal animosity between him and Henry, it
might not now be impossible to detach him from the alliance of France, and
renew that confederacy with England from which he had formerly reaped so much
advantage. He sent Henry proposals for a return to ancient amity, upon
these conditions<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Du Bellay, liv▪ 5.
Herbert. Burnet, vol. 3. in Coll. N<SUP>o</SUP> 50.</NOTE>; that he should be
reconciled to the pope, that he should assist him in his war with the
Turk, and that he should take party with him against Francis, who now
threatened the dutchy of Milan. The King replied, that he was willing to be on
good terms with the emperor, provided he would acknowledge, that the for∣mer
breach of friendship came entirely from himself: As to the conditions
pro∣posed; the proceedings against the bishop of Rome were so just,
and so fully ratified by the Parliament of England, that they could not now
be revoked; when christian princes should have settled peace among
themselves, he would <PB N="196" REF="201"/> not fail exert that vigour, which
became him, against the enemies of the faith; and after amity with the
emperor was once fully restored, he would then be in a situation, as a
common friend both to him and Francis, either to medi∣ate an agreement between
them, or to assist the injured party.</P>
<P>WHAT rendered Henry more indifferent to the advances made by the
emperor, was his experience of the usual duplicity and insincerity of that
monarch, and the intelligence which he received of the present transactions
in Europe. Francis Sforza, duke of Milan, was dead without issue; and the
em∣peror maintained, that the dutchy, being a fief of the empire, was devolved
to him, as the head of the Germanic body: Not to give umbrage, however, to the
states of Italy, he professed his intention of bestowing that
principality on some prince, who should be obnoxious to no party, and he
even made offer of it to the duke of Angouleme, third son to Francis. The
French monarch, who pretended that his own right to Milan was now revived upon
Sforza's death, was contented to substitute his second son, the duke of
Orleans, in his place; and the emperor pretended to close with this
proposal. But his sole intention in that liberal concession was to gain
time, till he should put himself in a warlike posture, and be able to
carry an invasion into Francis's dominions. The antient enmity between
these princes broke out anew in bravadoes, and in personal in∣sults on
each other, not becoming persons of their rank, and still less suitable
to men of such unquestioned bravery. Charles soon after invaded Provence
in person, with an army of fifty thousand men; but met with no success.
His army perished with sickness, fatigue, famine, and other
disasters; and he was obliged to raise the siege of Marseilles, and
retire into Italy with the broken re∣mains of his forces. An army of
imperialists, near 30,000 strong, which in∣vaded France on the side of
the Netherlands, and laid siege to Peronne, made no greater progress, but
retired upon the approach of a French army. And Henry had thus the
satisfaction to find, both that his ally, Francis, was likely to support
himself without foreign assistance, and that his own tranquillity was
fully ensured by these violent wars and animosities on the continent.</P>
<P>IF any inquietude remained with the English court, it was
solely occasioned by the state of affairs in Scotland. James, hearing of
the distressed situation of his ally, Francis, very generously levied
some forces; and embarking them on board vessels, which he had hired for
that purpose, landed them safely in France. He even came over in person;
and making haste to join the French King's camp, which then lay in Provence,
and to partake of his danger, he met that prince at Lyons, who, having
repulsed the emperor's invasion, was now return∣ing to his capital.
Recommended by so agreeable and seasonable an instance of 
<PB N="197" REF="202"/> friendship, the King of Scots made suit to Magdalen,
daughter to the French monarch, who had no other scruple in agreeing to the
match, than what was de∣rived from the infirm state of his daughter's health,
which seemed to threaten her with an approaching end. But James having gained
the affections of the princess, and obtained her consent, the father would
no longer oppose the united desires of his daughter and friend; and they
were accordingly married, and soon after set sail for Scotland, where the
young Queen, as was foreseen, died in a little time after her arrival.
Francis, however, was afraid, lest his ally, Henry, whom he likewise looked
on as his friend, and who lived with him on a more cordial footing than is
usual among great princes, should be displeased that this close
confederacy between France and Scotland was concluded without his
par∣ticipation. He therefore dispatched Pommeraye to London, in order to
apolo∣gize for this measure; but Henry, with his usual openness and
freedom, ex∣pressed such displeasure, that he refused even to
confer with the ambassador; and Francis was apprehensive of a rupture
with a prince, who regulated his measures more by humour and passion than
by the rules of political prudence. But Henry was so fettered by the
opposition, in which he was engaged against the pope and the emperor, that
he pursued no farther this disgust against Francis; and in the end
every thing remained in tranquillity both on the side of France and
Scotland.</P>
<P>THE domestic peace of England seemed to be exposed to more
hazard, by the violent innovations in religion; and it may be affirmed, that,
in this dangerous conjuncture, nothing ensured public tranquillity so much
as the decisive authority acquired by the King, and his great ascendant
over all his subjects. Not only the devotion paid the crown, was profound
during that age: The personal re∣spect, inspired by Henry, was
considerable; and even the terrors, with which he over-awed every one, were
not attended with any considerable degree of hatred. His frankness, his
sincerity, his magnificence, his generosity, were vir∣tues which
counterballanced his violence, cruelty, and impetuosity. And the important
rank, which his vigour, more than address, acquired him in all foreign
negotiations, flattered the vanity of Englishmen, and made them the more
willingly endure those domestic hardships, to which they were exposed.
The King, conscious of his advantages, was now proceeding to the most
dangerous trial of his authority; and after paving the way for that measure
by several expe∣dients, he was at last determined to suppress the
monasteries, and to put himself in possession of their ample
revenues.</P>
<P>THE great encrease of monasteries, if matters be
considered merely in a politi∣cal light, will appear the radical
inconvenience of the catholic religion; and every <PB N="198" REF="203"/> other
disadvantage, attending that communion, seems to have an inseparable
con∣nection with these religious institutions. Papal usurpations, the
tyranny of the in∣quisition, the multiplication of holidays; all these
letters on liberty and industry, were ultimately derived from the authority
and insinuation of monks, who being scattered every where, proved so many
colonies of superstition and of folly. This order of men were extremely
enraged against Henry; and regarded the abolition of the papal authority in
England, as the removal of the sole protec∣tion which they enjoyed against
the rapacity of the crown and of the courtiers. They were now subjected to
the King's visitation; the supposed sacredness of their bulls from
Rome was rejected; the progress of the reformation abroad, which had every
where been attended with the abolition of the monastic state, gave them
reason to expect like consequences in England; and tho' the King still
maintained the ancient doctrine of purgatory, to which most of the convents
owed their origin and support, it was foreseen, that, in the progress of
the con∣test, he would every day be led to depart wider from antient
institutions, and be drawn nearer the tenets of the reformers, with whom his
political interests natu∣rally induced him to ally himself. Moved by
these considerations, the friars made use of all their influence to
enflame the people against the King's government; and Henry, finding their
safety irreconcilable with his own, was determined to seize the present
opportunity, and utterly destroy his declared enemies.</P>
<P>CROMWEL, secretary of state, had been appointed
vicar-general, or vicege∣rent, a new office, by which the King's supremacy,
or the absolute, uncontroul∣able power assumed over the church, was
delegated to him. He employed Lay∣ton, London, Price, Gage, Petre, Bellasis,
and others, as commissioners, who carried on, every where, a rigorous
enquiry with regard to the conduct and de∣portment of all the friars. During
times of faction, especially of the religious kind, no equity is to be
expected from adversaries; and as it was known, that the King's intention in
this visitation, was to find a pretence for abolishing mo∣nasteries, we
may naturally conclude, that the reports of the commissioners are very
little to be relied on. Friars were encouraged to bring in informations
against their brethren; the slightest evidence was credited; and even the
calum∣nies spread abroad by the friends to the reformation, were regarded as
grounds of proof. Monstrous disorders are therefore said to have been
found in many of the religious houses: Whole convents of women abandoned to
lewdness: Signs of abortions procured, of infants murdered, of unnatural
lusts between persons of the same sex. It is indeed probable, that the
blind submission of the people, during those ages, would render the
friars and nuns more unguarded, and more dissolute, than they are in any
roman catholic country at present: But still, the <PB N="199" REF="204"/>
reproaches, which it is safest to credit, are such as point at vices,
naturally con∣nected with the very institution of convents, and with the
monastic life. The cruel and inveterate factions and quarrels therefore which
the commissioners mentioned, are very credible, among men, who, being
confined together within the same walls, never can forget their mutual
animosities, and who, being cut off from all the most endearing connections
of nature, are commonly cursed with hearts more selfish, and tempers more
unrelenting, than fall to the share of other men. The pious frauds,
practised to increase the devotion and liberality of the people, may be
regarded as certain, in an order founded on illusions, lies, and
superstition. The supine idleness, also, and its attendant, profound
ignorance, with which the convents were reproached, admit of no question; and
tho' monks were the true preservers, as well as inventors, of the dreaming
and captious philosophy of the schools, no manly or elegant knowledge could
be expected among men, whose life, condemned to a tedious uniformity, and
deprived of all emulation, afforded nothing to raise the mind, or cultivate
the genius.</P>
<P>SOME few monasteries, terrified with this rigorous
inquisition carried on by Cromwel and his commissioners, surrendered
their revenues into the King's hands; and the monks received small pensions
as the reward of their obsequiousness. Orders were given to dismiss
such nuns and friars as were below four and twenty, and whose vows were, on
that account, supposed not to be binding. The doors of the convents were
opened, even to such as were above that age; and all those recovered their
liberty who desired it. But as all these expedients did not fully answer
the King's purpose, he had recourse to his usual instrument of power,
the Parliament; and in order to prepare men for the innovations projected, the
report of the visitors was published, and a general horror was endeavoured
to be excited in the nation against institutions which, to their
ancestors, had been the objects of the most profound veneration.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">4 February.</NOTE> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Parliament.</NOTE> THE King, tho' determined
to abolish utterly the monastic order, resolved to proceed gradually in
this great work; and he gave directions to the Par∣liament to go no further at

corrupted, as lying less under the restraint of shame, and being

thereby prepare the way for the greater innovations projected. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Suppression of the lesser

monasteries were suppressed, and their revenues, amounting to thirty

revenue could not have supported near that number. The Mendicants, no doubt,
still continued their former profession.</NOTE>. It appears not that any
opposition was made to this important law: So absolute was Henry's
authority! A court, called the court of augmentation of the King's revenue, was
appointed for the management of these funds. The people naturally concluded,
from the erection of this court, that Henry in∣tended to proceed in spoiling
the church of her patrimony<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">27 Hen. VIII. c.
27.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE act formerly passed, empowering the King to name
thirty-two commissi∣oners for framing a body of canon law, was renewed; but
the project was never carried into execution. Henry thought, that the present
confusion of that law encreased his authority, and kept the clergy in
still greater dependance.</P>
<P>FARTHER progress was made in compleating the union of Wales
with England: The separate jurisdictions of several great lords or
marchers, as they were called, which obstructed the course of justice in
Wales, and encouraged robbery and pil∣laging, were abolished; and the
authority of the King's courts was extended every where. Some jurisdictions
of a like nature in England were also abolished<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">27 Hen. VIII. c. 4.</NOTE>this session.</P>
<P>THE commons, sensible that they had gained nothing by
opposing the King's will, when he formerly endeavoured to secure the
profits of wardships and li∣veries, were now contented to frame a law<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">27 Hen. VIII. c. 10.</NOTE>, such as he dictated to them.
It was enacted, that the possession of land shall be adjudged to be
in those who have the use of it, not in those to whom it is transferred
in trust.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">14 April.</NOTE> AFTER all these laws were
passed, the King dissolved the Parliament; a Par∣liament memorable, not
only for the great and important innovations which it introduced, but also
for the long time it had sat, and the frequent proroga∣tions which it had
undergone. Henry had found it so obsequious to his will, that he did not
chuse, during these religious ferments, to hazard a new election; and he
continued the same Parliament above six years: A practice, at that time,
quite unprecedented in England.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A convoca∣tion.</NOTE> THE convocation, which
sat during this session, were engaged in a very im∣portant work, the
deliberating on the new translation which was projected of the scriptures.
Tindal had formerly given a translation, and it had been greedily read by the
people; but as the clergy complained of it, as very inaccurate and unfaithful,
it was now proposed that they should themselves publish a
translation, which would not be liable to those objections. The friends of
the reformation asserted, that nothing could be more absurd than to
conceal, in an unknown <PB N="201" REF="206"/> tongue, the word itself of God,
and thus to counteract the will of heaven, which, for the purpose of
universal salvation, had published that salutary doctrine to all
nations: That if this practice was not very absurd, the artifice at least
was very barefaced, and proved a consciousness, that the glosses and
traditions of the cler∣gy stood in direct opposition to the original text,
dictated by Supreme Intelli∣gence: That it was now necessary for the
people, so long abused by interested pretensions, to see with their
own eyes, and to examine whether the claims of the ecclesiastics were
founded on that charter, which was on all hands acknow∣ledged to be derived
from heaven: And that as a spirit of research and curiosity was happily
revived, and men were now obliged to make a choice among the pretensions of
different sects, the proper materials for decision, and above all, the holy
scriptures, should be set before them, and the revealed will of God,
which the change of language had somewhat obscured, be again, by their
means, re∣vealed to mankind.</P>
<P>THE favourers of the ancient religion maintained, on the other
hand, that the pretence of making the people see with their own eyes, was a
mere cheat, and was itself a very barefaced artifice, by which the new
preachers hoped to obtain the guidance of them, and seduce them from those
pastors, whom the laws, whom ancient establishments, whom heaven itself
had appointed for their spiri∣tual direction: That the people were, by their
ignorance, their stupidity, their necessary avocations, totally
unqualified to choose their own principles, and it was a mocquery to set
materials before them, of which they could not possibly make any proper
use: That even in the affairs of common life, and in their temporal concerns,
which lay more within the compass of human reason, the laws had, in a great
measure, deprived them of the right of private judgment, and had, happily,
for their own and the public interest, regulated their conduct and behaviour:
That theological questions were placed much beyond the sphere of vulgar
comprehension; and ecclesiastics themselves, tho' assisted by all
the advantages of education, erudition, and an assiduous study of the
science, could not be fully assured of a just decision; except by the
promise made them in scrip∣ture, that God would be ever present with his
church, and that the gates of hell should not prevail against her: That the
gross errors adopted by the wisest heathens, proved how unfit men were to
grope their own way, thro' this pro∣found darkness; nor would the
scriptures, if trusted to every man's judgment, be able to remedy; on the
contrary, they would much augment, these fatal illu∣sions: That sacred
writ itself was involved in so much obscurity, was exposed to so many
difficulties, contained so many appearing contradictions, that it was the
most dangerous weapon which could be intrusted into the hands of the
ignorant <PB N="202" REF="207"/> and giddy multitude: That the poetical
spirit, in which a great part of it was composed, at the same time that
it occasioned uncertainty in the sense, by its multi∣plied tropes and
figures, was sufficient to kindle the zeal of fanaticism, and there∣by
throw civil society into the most furious combustion: That a thousand
sects must arise, which would pretend, each of them, to derive its tenets
from the scripture; and would be able, by specious arguments, or even
without specious arguments, to seduce silly women, and ignorant
mechanics, into a belief of the most monstrous principles: And that if ever
this disorder, dangerous to the magistrate himself, received a remedy, it
must be from the tacit acquiescence of the people in some new authority;
and it was evidently better, without farther contest or enquiry, to adhere
peaceably to ancient, and therefore the more secure establishments.</P>
<P>THESE latter arguments being more agreeable to
ecclesiastical government, would probably have prevailed in the
convocation, had it not been for the autho∣rity of Cranmer, Latimer, and some
other bishops, who were supposed to speak the King's sense of the
matter. A vote was passed for publishing a new transla∣tion of the
scriptures; and in three years time this great work was finished, and
printed at Paris. This was deemed a great point gained by the reformers; and a
considerable advancement of their cause. Farther progress was soon
expected, after such important successes.</P>
<P>BUT while the retainers to the new religion were triumphing in
their prospe∣rity, they met with a mortification, which seemed to blast
all their hopes: 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Disgrace of Q. Anne.</NOTE> Their
patroness, Anne Boleyn, lost the King's favour, and soon after her life,
from the rage of that furious monarch. Henry had persevered constantly in
his love to this lady, during six years that his prosecution of the divorce
lasted; and the more obstacles he met with to the gratification of his
passion, the more deter∣mined zeal did he exert in pursuing his
purpose. But the affection which had subsisted so long under
difficulties, had no sooner attained secure possession of its
object, than it languished from satiety; and the King's heart was
apparently ali∣enated from his consort. Anne's enemies soon perceived this
fatal change; and they were very forward to widen the breach, when they found
that they incurred no danger by interposing in those delicate concerns. She
had brought forth a dead son; and Henry's extreme fondness for male
issue being thus, for the pre∣sent, disappointed, his temper, equally
violent and superstitious, was dis∣posed to make the innocent mother
answerable for this misfortune<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol I. p.
19<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE>. But the chief means
which Anne's enemies employed to enflame the King against her, was his
jealousy.</P>
<P><PB N="203" REF="208"/> ANNE, tho' she appears to have been
entirely innocent, and even virtuous, in her conduct, had a certain gaiety, if
not levity, of character, which threw her off her guard, and made her less
circumspect than her situation required. Her education in France rendered
her the more prone to these freedoms; and it was with difficulty she
conformed herself to that strict ceremonial which was practised in the
court of England. More vain than haughty, she was pleased to see the
in∣fluence of her beauty on all around her, and she indulged herself in an
easy fa∣miliarity with persons, who were formerly her equals, and who might
then have pretended to her friendship and good graces. Henry's dignity was
offended with these popular manners; and tho' the lover had been entirely
blind, the husband possessed but too quick discernment and
penetration. Wicked instruments interpo∣sed, and put a malignant
interpretation on the harmless liberties of the Queen: The viscountess of
Rocheford, in particular, who was married to the Queen's brother, but who lived
on bad terms with her sister-in-law, insinuated the most cruel
sus∣picions into the King's mind; and as she was a woman of a very
profligate cha∣racter, she paid no regard either to truth or humanity in
those calumnies which she suggested. She pretended, that her own
husband was engaged in a criminal correspondence with his sister; and
not contented with this imputation, she poi∣soned every action of the
Queen, and represented each instance of favour which she conferred on any
one, as a token of affection. Henry Norris, groom of the stole, Weston, and
Brereton, gentlemen of the King's chamber, together with Mark Smeton, groom of
the chamber, were observed to possess much of the Queen's friendship;
and they served her with a zeal and attachment which, tho' chiefly derived
from gratitude, might not improbably be seasoned with some mixture of
tenderness for so amiable a princess. The King's jealousy laid hold of
the slight∣est circumstance; and finding no particular object on which it
could fasten, it vented itself equally on every one who came within the
verge of its fury.</P>
<P>HAD Henry's jealousy been derived from love, tho' it might on
a sudden have proceeded to the most violent extremities, it would have been
subject to many re∣morses and contrarieties; and might at last have
served only to augment that af∣fection, on which it was founded. But it was a
more stern jealousy, fostered en∣tirely by pride: His love was wholly
transferred to another object. Jane Sey∣mour, daughter of Sir John Seymour, and
maid of honour to the Queen, a young lady of singular beauty and merit, had
obtained an entire ascendant over him; and he was determined to sacrifice
every thing to the gratification of this new appetite. Unlike to most
monarchs, who judge lightly of the crime of gal∣lantry, and who deem the young
damsels of their court rather honoured than dis∣graced by their
passion, he never thought of any other attachment than that of mar∣riage; 
<PB N="204" REF="209"/> and in order to attain this end, he underwent more
difficulties and com∣mitted greater crimes than those which he sought to
avoid by forming that legal connexion. And having thus entertained the design
of raising his new mistress to his bed and throne, he more willingly
hearkened to every suggestion, which threw any imputation of guilt on the
unfortunate Anne Boleyn.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">1st May.</NOTE> THE King's jealousy
first appeared openly in a tilting at Greenwich, where the Queen happened to
drop her handkerchief; an incident probably ca∣sual, but interpreted by him
as an instance of gallantry to some of her para∣mours<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. 1. p. 198.</NOTE>. He immediately retired from the
place; sent orders to confine her to her chamber; arrested Norris,
Brereton, Weston, and Smeton, together with her brother, Rocheford; and threw
them into prison. The Queen, astonished at these instances of his
fury, thought that he meant only to try her; but finding him in earnest,
she reflected on his obstinate unrelenting spirit, and she prepared
herself for that melancholy doom, which was awaiting her. Next day, she was
sent to the Tower; and on her way thither, she was informed of her
supposed offences, of which she had been hitherto ignorant: She made
earnest protestations of her innocence; and when she entered the
prison, she fell on her knees, and prayed God so to help her, as she
was not guilty of the crime imputed to her. Her surprize and confusion
threw her into histerical disorders; and in that situation, she thought
that the best proof of innocence was to make an entire confession, and
she discovered some indiscretions and levities, which her simplicity
had equally be∣trayed her to commit and to avow. She owned, that she had once
rallied Norris on his delaying his marriage, and had told him, that he probably
expected her, when she should be a widow: She had reproved Weston, she
said, for his af∣fection to a kinswoman of hers, and his indifference
towards his wife: But he told her, that she had mistaken the object of his
affection, for it was herself: Upon which, she defied him<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Strype, vol. 1. p. 281.</NOTE>. She affirmed, that Smeton had
never been in her chamber but twice when he played on the harpsicord: But
she acknowledged, that he had once had the boldness to tell her, that a
look sufficed him. The King, instead of being satisfied with the candour
and sincerity of her confession, regarded these indiscretions only as
preludes to greater and more criminal intimacies.</P>
<P>OF all those multitudes, whom the beneficence of the Queen's
temper had obliged, during her prosperous fortune, no one durst interpose
between her and the King's fury; and the person, whose advancement every
breath had favoured, and every countenance had smiled upon, was now left
neglected and abandoned. Even her uncle the duke of Norfolk, preferring the
connexions of party to the t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es of
blood, was become her most dangerous enemy; and all the retainers to the 
<PB N="205" REF="210"/> catholic religion hoped, that her death would terminate
the King's quarrel with Rome, and leave him again to his natural and early
bent, which had inclined him to support the most intimate connexions with
the apostolic <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ee. Cranmer alone,
of all the Queen's adherents, still retained his friendship for her; and,
as far as the King's impetuosity permitted him, he endeavoured to moderate
the violent prejudices, entertained against her.</P>
<P>THE Queen herself wrote Henry a letter from the Tower, full of
the most tender expostulations, and of the warmest protestations of
innocence. It contains so much nature and even elegance, as to deserve to
be transmitted to posterity, without any alteration of the expression.
It is as follows.</P>
<LETTER>
<P>SIR, your grace's displeasure, and my imprisonment are
things so strange unto me, as what to write, or what to excuse, I am
altogether ignorant. Whereas you send unto me (willing me to confess a
truth, and so obtain your favour) by such an one, whom you know to be mine
antient professed enemy, I no sooner received this message by him,
than I rightly conceived your mean∣ing; and, if, as you say, confessing a
truth indeed may procure my safety, I shall with all willingness and duty
perform your command.</P>
<P>BUT let not your grace ever imagine, that your poor wife will
ever be brought to acknowledge a fault, where not so much as a thought
thereof pre∣ceded. And to speak a truth, never prince had wife more loyal in
all duty, and in all true affection, than you have ever found in Anne Boleyn:
With which name and place I could willingly have contented myself, if God and
your grace's pleasure had been so pleased. Neither did I at any time so
far forget myself in my exaltation or received queenship, but that I always
looked for such an alteration as I now find; for the ground of my preferment
being on no surer foundation than your grace's fancy, the least alteration
I knew was fit and sufficient to draw that fancy to some other object. You
have chosen me from a low estate to be your Queen and companion, far beyond
my desert or desire. If then you found me worthy of such honour, good
your grace let not any light fancy, or bad counsel of mine enemies, withdraw
your princely favour from me; neither let that stain, that unworthy stain,
of a disloyal heart towards your good grace, ever cast so foul a blot on
your most dutiful wife, and the infant princess your daughter. Try me, good
King, but let me have a lawful trial, and let not my sworn enemies sit as
my accusers and judges; yea let me receive an open trial, for my truth
shall fear no open shame; then shall you see either mine innocence
cleared, your suspicion and <PB N="206" REF="211"/> conscience
satisfied, the ignominy and slander of the world stopped, or my guilt
openly declared. So that whatsoever God or you may determine of me, your
grace may be freed from an open censure, and mine offence being so
law∣fully proved, your grace is at liberty, both before God and man, not only
to execute worthy punishment on me as an unlawful wife, but to follow your
af∣fection, already settled on that party, for whose sake I am now as I
am, whose name I could some good while since have pointed unto, your
grace not being ignorant of my suspicion therein.</P>
<P>BUT if you have already determined of me, and that not only my
death, but an infamous slander must bring you the enjoying of your
desired happiness; then I desire of God, that he will pardon your great
sin there∣in, and likewise mine enemies, the instruments thereof, and
that he will not call you to a strict account for your unprincely and cruel
usage of me, at his general judgment-seat, where both you and myself
must shortly ap∣pear, and in whose judgment I doubt not (whatsoever the
world may think of me) mine innocence shall be openly known, and
sufficiently cleared.</P>
<P>MY last and only request shall be, that myself may
only bear the burden of your grace's displeasure, and that it may not touch
the innocent souls of those poor gentlemen, who (as I understand) are
likewise in strait imprison∣ment for my sake. If ever I have found
favour in your sight, if ever the name of Anne Boleyn hath been pleasing in
your ears, then let me obtain this request, and I will so leave to trouble
your grace any further, with mine earn∣est prayers to the Trinity to have
your grace in his good keeping, and to di∣rect you in all your actions. From my
doleful prison in the Tower, this sixth of May;</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Your most loyal and ever faithful wife, ANNE
BOLEYN.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Her trial.</NOTE> THIS letter had no
influence on the unrelenting mind of Henry, who was de∣termined to pave the way
for his new marriage by the death of Anne Boleyn. Norris, Weston, Brereton,
and Smeton, were tried; but no legal evidence was produced against them. The
chief proof of their guilt consisted in a hear-say report from one lady
Wingfield, who was dead. Smeton was prevailed on, by the vain hope of life, to
confess a criminal correspondence with the Queen<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. I. p. 202.</NOTE>; but even her enemies expected
little advantage from this confession: For they never dared to confront him
with her; and he was immediately executed; as were <PB N="207" REF="212"/>
also Brereton and Weston. Norris had been much in the King's favour; and an
offer was made him of life, if he would confess his crime, and accuse the
Queen: But he generously rejected that proposal; and said, that in his
conscience he be∣lieved her entirely guiltless: But, for his part, he could
accuse her of nothing, and he would die a thousand deaths rather than
calumniate an innocent person.</P>
<P>THE Queen and her brother were tried by a jury of peers,
consisting of the duke of Suffolk, the Marquis of Exeter, the earl of
Arundel, and twenty-three more: Their uncle, the duke of Norfolk, presided as
lord high steward. Upon what proof or pretext the crime of incest was
imputed to them is unknown: The chief evidence, it is said, amounted to no
more than that Rocheford had been seen to lean on her bed before some
company. Part of the charge against her was, that she had affirmed to her
minions, that the King never had her heart; and had said to each of them
apart, that she loved him better than any person whatsoever: <HI>Which
was to the slander of the issue begot between the King and her:</HI> By
this strained interpretation, her guilt was brought under the statute of
the 25th of this reign; in which it was declared criminal to throw any
slander upon the King, Queen, or their issue. Such palpable absurdities
were, at that time, admitted, and they were regarded by the peers of England as
a sufficient reason for sacri∣ficing an innocent Queen to the cruelty of
their tyrant. Tho' unassisted by coun∣sel, she defended herself
with great judgment and presence of mind; and the spectators could not
forbear pronouncing her entirely innocent. Judgment, how∣ever, was given by the
court, both against the Queen and lord Rocheford; and her verdict contained,
that she should be burned or beheaded at the King's plea∣sure. When this
dreadful sentence was pronounced, she was not terrified, but lifting up her
hands to heaven, said, 
<Q REND="inline">"O! Father, O! Creator, thou who art the way,
the truth, and the life, thou knowest that I have not deserved this
death."</Q> And then turning to the judges, made the most pathetic
decla∣rations of her innocence.</P>
<P>HENRY, not satisfied with this cruel vengeance, was resolved
entirely to annul his marriage with Anne Boleyn, and to declare her issue
illegitimate: He recalled to his memory, that, a little after her appearance in
the English court, some attach∣ment had been acknowledged between her and
the earl of Northumberland, then lord Piercy; and he now questioned the
nobleman with regard to these engage∣ments. Northumberland took an oath
before the two archbishops, that no con∣tract nor promise of marriage had
ever passed between them: He received the sacrament upon it, before the
duke of Norfolk and others of the privy council; and this solemn act he
accompanied with the most solemn protestations of his ve∣racity. 
<PB N="208" REF="213"/><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Herbert, page 384.</NOTE>. The
Queen, however, was shaken by menaces of executing the sen∣tence against
her in its greatest rigour, and was prevailed on to confess in court,
some lawful impediment to her marriage with the King<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Heylin, p. 94.</NOTE>. The afflicted primate, who sat as judge,
thought himself obliged by this confession, to pronounce the marriage
null and invalid. Henry, in the transports of his fury, did not perceive that
his proceedings were totally inconsistent, and that if her marriage was,
from the beginning, invalid, she could not possibly be guilty of
adultery.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">And execu∣tion.</NOTE> THE Queen now prepared
for suffering that death to which she was sen∣tenced. She sent her
last message to the King, and acknowledged the obligations which she
owed him, in continuing thus uniformly his endeavours for her ad∣vancement:
From a private gentlewoman, she said, he had first made her a
marchioness, then a queen, and now, since he could raise her no higher in
this world, he was sending her to be a saint in heaven: She then renewed
the pro∣testations of her innocence, and recommended her daughter to his
care. Before the lieutenant of the Tower, and all who approached her, she
made the like de∣clarations; and continued to behave herself with her usual
serenity, and even with chearfulness. 
<Q REND="inline">"The executioner," she said to the
lieutenant, "is, I hear, very expert; and my neck is very slender:"</Q> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">29th May.</NOTE> Upon which she grasped it
in her hand, and laughed heartily. When brought, however, to the scaffold,
she softened her tone a little with regard to her protestations of
innocence. She reflected, that the obstinacy of Queen Catherine, and her
resistance to the King's will, had much alienated him from the lady Mary;
and her maternal concern, therefore, for Elizabeth, prevailed in these last
moments over that indignation, which the unjust sentence, by which she
suffered, naturally excited in her. She said, that she was come to die,
as she was sentenced, by the law: She would ac∣cuse none, nor say any
thing of the ground upon which she was judged. She prayed heartily for the
King; and called him a most merciful and gentle prince, and acknowledged,
that he had always been to her a good and gracious sovereign; and if any one
should think proper to canvass her cause, she desired him to judge
the best<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. I. p. 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>5.</NOTE>. She was beheaded by the
executioner of Calais, who was brought over as more expert than any in England.
Her body was negligently thrown into a common chest of elm-tree, made to hold
arrows; and was buried in the Tower.</P>
<P>THE innocence of this unfortunate Queen cannot reasonably be
called in ques∣tion. Henry himself, in the violence of his rage, knew not
whom to accuse as her lover; and tho' he imputed guilt to her brother, and
four persons more, he <PB N="209" REF="214"/> was able to bring proof
against none of them. The whole tenour of her con∣duct forbids us to
ascribe to her an abandoned character, such as is implied in the King's
accusation; and had she been so lost to all prudence and sense of
shame; she must have exposed herself to detection, and afforded her
enemies the clearest evidence against her. But the King made the most
effectual apology for her, by marrying Jane Seymour the very day after her
execution<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Burnet vol I. p. 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>7.</NOTE>. His im∣patience to gratify
this new passion, caused him to forget all regard to decency; and his
cruel heart was not softened a moment by the bloody catastrophe of a
person, who had so long been the object of his most tender
affections.</P>
<P>THE lady Mary thought the death of her step-mother a proper
opportunity for reconciling herself with the King, who, besides other
causes of disgust, had been offended with her, on account of the part
which she had taken in her mother's quarrel. Her advances were not at first
received; and Henry exacted from her some further proofs of submission
and obedience: He required this young prin∣cess, then about twenty years of
age, to adopt his theological tenets; to acknow∣ledge his supremacy; to
renounce the pope; and to own her mother's marriage to be incestuous and
unlawful. These points were of hard digestion with the princess; but
after some delays, and even refusals, she was at last prevailed with to
write a letter to her father<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ibid.
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> vol. I. p
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</NOTE>, containing her
assent to the articles required of her: Upon which she was received into
favour. But notwithstanding the return of the King's affection to the
issue of his first marriage, he divested not himself of kindness
towards the lady Elizabeth; and the new Queen, who was blest with a
singular sweetness of disposition, discovered strong proofs of
attachment to that young princess.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">8th June.</NOTE> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Parliament.</NOTE> THE trial and conviction
of Queen Anne, and the subsequent events, made it necessary for the
King to summon a new Parliament; and he here, in his speech, made a merit
to his people, that, notwithstanding his misfortunes in his two former
marriages, he had been induced, for their good, to venture on a third. The
speaker received this profession with a suitable gratitude; and he took
thence oc∣casion to praise the King for his wonderful gifts of grace and
nature: He com∣pared him, for justice and prudence, to Solomon; for
strength and fortitude to Sampson; and for beauty and comeliness to
Absalom. The King very humbly replied, by the mouth of his chancellor, that
he disavowed these praises; since, if he was really possessed
of such virtues, they were the gifts of Almighty God only. Henry found that
the Parliament were equally submissive in deeds as
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in their expressions; and
that they would go the same lengths as the
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o mer in gratifying even his
most lawless passions. His divorce from Anne Bo∣leyn 
<PB N="210" REF="215"/> was ratified; that Queen, and all her accomplices, were
attainted; the issue of both the two former marriages were declared
illegitimate, and it was even made treason to assert the legitimacy of
either of them; to throw any slander upon the present King, Queen, or their
issue, was subjected to the same penalty; the crown was settled on
the King's issue by Jane Seymour, or any subsequent wife; and in case
he should die without children, he was impowered by his will, or letters
pa∣tent, to dispose of the crown: An enormous concession<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The King is thought to have had a design of leaving
the crown, in case of the failure of his law∣ful male issue, to his
favourite son, the duke of Richmond. But the death of that promising
noble∣man, which happened soon after, disappointed all projects in his
favour. Heylin, p. 6.</NOTE>, especially when en∣trusted to a prince so
violent and capricious in his humour. Whoever being re∣quired, refused to
answer upon oath to any article of this act of settlement, was declared to
be guilty of treason; and by this clause a species of political
inquisi∣tion was established in the kingdom, as well as the accusations
of treason multi∣plied to an unreasonable degree. The King was also
empowered to confer on any one, by his will, or letters patent, any castles,
honours, liberties, or franchises; words which might have been extended to
the dismembring the kingdom, by the erection of principalities and
independant jurisdictions. It was also, by another act, made treason to
marry, without the King's consent, any princess related in the first
degree to the crown. This act was occasioned by the discovery of a
de∣sign, formed by Thomas Howard, brother to the duke of Norfolk, to
espouse the lady Margaret Douglas, niece to the King by his sister the
Queen of Scots and the earl of Angus. Howard, as well as the young lady, was
committed to the Tower. She recovered her liberty soon after; but he died in
that confine∣ment. An act of attainder passed against him this
session of parliament.</P>
<P>A NEW accession was likewise gained to the authority of
the crown: The King or any of his successors was empowered to repeal or
annul, by letters patent, whatever acts of parliament had been passed
before he was four and twenty years of age. Whoever maintained the authority of
the bishop of Rome, by word or writ, or endeavoured in any manner to
restore it in England, was subjected to the penalty of a premunire; that
is, his goods were forfeited, and he was put out of the protection of the laws.
And any person who possessed any office, eccle∣siastical or
civil, or received any grant or charter from the crown; and yet re∣fused to
renounce the pope by oath, was declared to be guilty of treason. The
re∣nounciation prescribed runs in the style of <HI>So help me God, all
saints, and the holy evangelists</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">28
Hen. VIII. c. 10.</NOTE>. The pope, hearing of Anne Boleyn's disgrace and
death, hoped that the door was opened to a reconciliation, and had been making
some ad∣vances <PB N="211" REF="216"/> to Henry: But this was the reception he
met with. Henry was now become absolutely indifferent with regard to papal
censures; and finding a great increase of authority, as well as revenue, to
accrue from his quarrel with Rome, he was determined to persevere in his
present measures. This Parliament also, even more than any foregoing,
convinced him how much he commanded the respect of his subjects, and what
confidence he might repose in them. Tho' the elections had been made of a
sudden, without any preparation or in∣trigue, the members discovered an
unlimited attachment to his person and go∣vernment<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. I. p. 212.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A convoca∣tion.</NOTE> THE extreme
complaisance of the convocation, which sat at the same time with the
Parliament, encouraged him in his resolution of breaking entirely with the
court of Rome. There was a division of sentiments in the minds of this
assembly; and as the zeal of the reformers had been augmented by s me
late successes, the resentment of the catholics was no less excited
by their fears and losses: But the authority of the King kept every thing
submissive and silent; and the new assumed prerogative, the
supremacy, whose limits no one was fully acquainted with, restrained even
the most furious movements of theological ran∣cour. Cromwel sat as
vicar-general; and tho' the catholic party expected, that, on the fall of Queen
Anne, his authority would receive a great check, they were surprized to find
him still maintain equal credit as before. With the vicar-general concurred
Cranmer the primate, Latimer bishop of Worcester, Shaxton of Sa∣lisbury,
Hilsey of Rochester, Fox of Hereford, Barlow of St. David's. The opposite
party were led by Lee archbishop of York, Stokesley bishop of Lon∣don,
Tonstal of Durham, Gardiner of Winchester, Longland of Lincoln, Sher∣borne
of Chichester, Nix of Norwich, and Kite of Carlisle. The former party, by
their opposition to the pope, seconded the King's ambition and love of
power: The latter party, by maintaining the ancient theological tenets, were
more con∣formable to his speculative principles: And both of them had
alternately the ad∣vantage of gaining on his humour, by which he was more
governed than by ei∣ther of these motives.</P>
<P>THE church in general was averse to the reformation; and the
lower house framed a list of opinions, in the whole sixty seven, which
they pronounced er∣roneous, and which was a collection of principles, some
held by the ancient Lol∣lards, others by the modern protestants, or
Gospellers, as they were sometimes called. This catalogue they sent to
the upper house to be censured; but in the preamble of their
representation, they discovered the servile spirit by which they were
governed. They said, 
<Q REND="inline">"that they intended not to do or speak any
thing <PB N="212" REF="217"/> which might be unpleasant to the King, whom they
acknowledge their su∣preme head, and whose commands they were resolved to
obey; renouncing the pope's usurped authority, with all his laws and
inventions, now extin∣guished and abolished; and addicting themselves to
Almighty God and his laws, and unto the King and the laws made within this
kingdom<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Collier, vol. II p. 119.</NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>THE convocation came at last, after some debate, to decide
articles of reli∣gion; and their tenets were of as compounded a nature as the
assembly itself, or rather as the King's system of theology, by which
they were resolved entirely to square their principles. They determined the
standard of faith to consist in the scriptures and the three creeds,
the Apostolic, the Nicene, and the Athanasian; and this article was a
signal victory to the reformers: Auricular confession and pennance were
admitted, a doctrine agreeable to the catholics: No mention was made of
marriage, extreme unction, confirmation, or holy orders, as sacraments; and
in this omission the influence of the protestants appeared. The real
presence was asserted, conformable to the ancient doctrine: The terms of
acceptance were esta∣blished to be the merits of Christ, and the mercy
and good pleasure of God, suitable to the new principles.</P>
<P>SO far the two sects seem to have made a fair partition, by
sharing alternately the several clauses. In framing the subsequent
articles, each of them seems to have thrown in their ingredient. The
catholics prevailed in asserting, that the use of images was warranted by
scripture; the protestants, in warning the peo∣ple against idolatry, and
the abuse of these sensible representations. The ancient faith was
adopted in maintaining the expediency of praying to saints; the late
in∣novations in rejecting the peculiar patronage of saints to any trade,
profession, or course of action. The former rites of worship, the use
of holy water, the ceremonies practised on Ash-wednesday, Palm-sunday,
and Good-friday, &amp;c. were still maintained; but the new resinements
were also adopted, which made light of these institutions, by the
convocation's denying that they had any imme∣diate power of remitting sin,
and by its asserting that their sole merit consisted in promoting
pious and devout dispositions in the mind.</P>
<P>BUT the article with regard to purgatory, contains the most
curious jargon, ambiguity, and hesitation, arising from the mixture of
opposite tenets. It was to this purpose: 
<Q REND="inline">"Since according to due order of charity, and
the book of Maccabees, and divers ancient authors, it is a very good and
charitable deed to pray for souls departed; and since such a practice has
been maintained in the church from the beginning; all bishops and teachers
should instruct the people not to be grieved for the continuance of the
same. But since the place <PB N="213" REF="218"/> where departed souls are
retained, before they reach Paradise, as well as the na∣ture of their pains,
is left uncertain by scripture; all such questions are to be submitted
to God, to whose mercy it is meet and convenient to commend the deceased,
trusting that he accepteth our prayers for them."</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Collier, vol. ii. p. 122, &amp; seq. Fuller. Burnet, vol. i. p.
215.</NOTE></P>
<P>THESE articles, when framed by the convocation, and corrected by
the King, were subscribed by every member of that assembly; while,
perhaps, neither there nor throughout the whole kingdom, could one man be
found, except the King himself, who had adopted precisely these very
doctrines and opinions. For tho' there be not any contradiction in the tenets
here advanced, it had happened in England, as in all other states where
factious divisions have place; a certain creed was embraced by each party;
few neutrals were to be found; and these consisted only of speculative
or whimsical people, of whom two persons could scarce be brought to an
agreement in the same dogmas. The protestants, all of them, carried their
opposition to Rome farther than these articles: None of the catholics went
so far: And the King, by being able to retain the nation in such a delicate
medium, displayed the utmost power of an imperious despotism, of which
any history furnishes an example. To change the religion of a country, even
when seconded by a party, is one of the most perilous enterprizes, which
any sovereign can attempt, and often proves the most destructive to royal
authority. But Henry was able to set that furious machine in movement, and
yet regulate and even stop its career: He could say to it, thus far shalt
thou go and no farther: And he made every vote of his parliament and
convocation subservient, not only to his interests and passions, but
even to his smallest caprices; nay, to his most refined and most
scholastic subtilties.</P>
<P>THE concurrence of these two national assemblies served,
no doubt, to increase the King's power among the people, and raised him to
an authority more abso∣lute, than any prince, in a simple monarchy, even by
means of military force, is ever able to attain. But there are certain bounds,
beyond which the most slavish submission cannot be extended. All
the late innovations, particularly the disso∣lution of the smaller
monasteries, and the imminent danger, to which all the rest were
exposed<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">A proposal had formerly been made in
the convocation for the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the

bred discontent in the people, and disposed them to a revolt. 
<PB N="214" REF="219"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Discontents among the people.</NOTE> The
expelled monks, wandering about the country, excited both men's piety and
compassion; and as the antient religion held the populace by powerful
motives, suited to their capacity, it was able, now that it was brought in
apparent hazard, to excite the strongest zeal in its favour<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Strype, vol. i. p. 249.</NOTE>. Discontents had
even reached some of the nobility and gentry, whose ancestors had founded
the monasteries, and who placed a vanity in those institutions, as well
as reaped some benefit from them, by the provisions, which they afforded
them for their younger children. The more superstitious were interested
in the fate of their forefathers souls, which, they believed, must now lye,
during many ages, in the torments of purgatory, for want of masses to
relieve them. It seemed unjust to abolish pious institutions for the
faults, real or pretended, of individuals. Even the most moderate and
rea∣sonable thought it somewhat iniquitous, that men, who had been invited
into a course of life by all the laws, human and divine, which prevailed in
their coun∣try, should be turned out of their possessions, and so
little care be taken of their future subsistance. And when it was
observed, that the rapacity and bribery of the commissioners and others
employed in visiting the monasteries, intercepted much of the profits
resulting from these confiscations, it tended much to encrease the
general discontent<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. i. p.
223.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT the people did not break out into open sedition, till the
complaints of the secular clergy concured with those of the regular. As
Cromwel's person was very little acceptable to the ecclesiastics; the
authority, which he exercised, be∣ing so new, so absolute, so
unlimited, inspired them with great disgust and terror. He published,
in the King's name, without the consent either of par∣liament or convocation,
an ordonance, by which he retrenched a great many of the antient holydays;
prohibited several superstitions, gainful to the clergy, such as
pilgrimages, images, relicts; and even ordered the incumbents in the
pa∣rishes to set apart a considerable portion of their revenues for
repairs and for the support of exhibitioners and the poor of their parish.
The secular priests, find∣ing themselves thus reduced to a grievous
slavery, instilled into the people those discontents, which they had
long harboured in their own bosoms.</P>
<P><PB N="215" REF="220"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Insurrection.</NOTE> THE first rising
was in Lincolnshire. It was headed by Dr. Mackrel, prior of Barlings, who was
disguised like a mean mechanic, and who bore the name of captain Cobler.
This tumultuous army amounted to above 20,000 men<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. i. p. 227. Herbert.</NOTE>; but notwithstanding
their number, they showed little disposition of proceeding to extremities
against the King, and seemed still over-awed by his authority. They
acknowleged him to be supreme head of the church of England; but they
complained of his suppressing the monasteries, of evil counsellors,
of men of mean birth entrusted by him, of the danger to which the jewels and
plate of their parochial churches were exposed: And they prayed him to
consult the nobility of the realm concerning the redress of these
grievances<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Herbert, p. 410.</NOTE>. The King was
little disposed to entertain apprehensions of danger, especially from a
low multitude, whom he despised. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">6th of Octo∣ber.</NOTE> He sent forces
against the insurgents under the command of the Duke of Suffolk; and he
returned them a very sharp answer to their petition. There were some
gentry, whom the populace had forced to take party with them, and who kept a
secret correspondence with Suffolk. They in∣formed him, that resentment
against the King's reply was the chief cause, which retained the
malecontents in arms, and that a milder answer would probably dis∣sipate
the rebellion: Henry had levied a great force at London, with which he was
preparing to march against the rebels; and being so well fortified with
power, he thought, that, without losing his dignity, he might now show them
some greater condescension. He sent a new proclamation, requiring them
to re∣turn to their obedience, with secret assurances of pardon. This
expedient had its effect: The populace were dissipated: Mackrel and some
of their leaders fell into the King's hands, and were executed: The greater
part of the multitude retired peaceably to their usual occupations: A few of
the more obstinate fled into the North, where they joined the insurrection,
that was raised in those parts.</P>
<P>THE northern insurgents, as they were more numerous, were
also more formidable than those of Lincolnshire, because the people
were more accus∣tomed to arms, and because of the near neighbourhood to
Scotland, which might make advantage of these disorders. One Aske, a
gentleman, had taken the command of them, and he possessed the art of
governing the populace. Their enterprize they called the <HI>Pilgrimage of
Grace:</HI> Some priests marched before in the habits of their order,
carrying crosses in their hands: In their banners was inwove a crucifix,
with the representation of a chalice, and of the five wounds of Christ<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Fox, vol. ii. p. 992▪</NOTE>: They wore on their
sleeve an emblem of the five wounds, with the name of Jesus wrought in the
midst: They all took an oath, that they <PB N="216" REF="221"/> had entered
into the pilgrimage of grace from no other motive, than their love to God,
their care of the King's person and issue▪ their desire of
purifying the nobility, of driving base-born persons from about the King,
of restoring the church, and of suppressing heresy. Allured by
these fair pretences, about 40,000 men from the counties of York, Durham,
Lancaster, and those northern pro∣vinces, flocked to their standard; and
their zeal, no less than their numbers, in∣spired the court with
apprehensions.</P>
<P>THE Earl of Shrewsbury, moved by his zeal for the King's
service, raised forces, tho' at first without any commission, in
order to oppose the rebels. The Earl of Cumberland repulsed them from his
castle of Skipton: Sir Ralph Evers defended Scarborow-castle against
them<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Stowe, p 574. Ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>r, p. 258.</NOTE>: Courtney, marquess of Exeter, the
King's cousin-german, obeyed orders from court, and levied troops. The earls
of Huntingdon, Derby, and Rutland, imitated his example. The rebels, how∣ever,
prevailed in taking both Hull and York: They laid siege to Pomfret castle,
into which the archbishop of York and lord Darcy had thrown themselves. It
was soon surrendered to them; and the prelate and nobleman, who secretly
fa∣voured the cause, seemed to yield to the force imposed on them, and
joined the rebels.</P>
<P>THE duke of Norfolk was named general in chief of the King's
forces against the northern insurgents; and as he headed the party, which
supported the antient religion, he was also suspected of bearing some
favour to the cause, which he was sent to oppose. His prudent conduct,
however, seems to acquit him of this im∣putation. He encamped at Doncaster,
together with the earl of Shrewsbury; and as his army was small, scarce
exceeding five thousand men, he made choice of a post, where he had the
river in front, the ford of which he proposed to desend against the
rebels. They had intended to attack him in the morning; but dur∣ing the night,
there fell such violent rains as rendered the river utterly impassi∣ble;
and Norfolk very wisely laid hold of the opportunity to enter into treaty
with them. In order to open the door for negotiation, he sent them a herald;
whom Aske, their leader, received with great ceremony; he himself sitting
in a chair of state, with the archbishop of York on one hand, and lord
Darcy on the other. It was agreed that two gentlemen should be dispatched
to the King with proposals from the insurgents; and Henry protracted giving
an answer, and allured them with hopes of entire satisfaction, in
expectation that necessity would soon oblige them to disperse
themselves. Being informed, that his artifice had in a great measure
succeeded, he required them instantly to lay down their arms and submit
to m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rcy; promising a pardon to
all except six whom he named, and <PB N="217" REF="222"/> four whom he
reserved to himself the power of naming. But tho' the greatest part of
the rebels had gone home for want of subsistance, they had entered into
the most solemn engagements to return to their standards, in case the
King's an∣swer should not prove satisfactory. Norfolk, therefore, soon
found himself in the same difficulty as before; and he opened again a
negotiation with the leaders of the multitude. He engaged them to send three
hundred persons to Doncaster, with proposals for an accommodation; and he
hoped to be able, by intrigue and separate interests, to throw
dissension among so great a number. Aske himself had proposed to
be one of the deputies, and he required a hostage for his secu∣rity: But
the King, when consulted, replied, that he knew no gentleman or other, whom
he esteemed so little as to put him in pledge for such a villain. The
demands of the insurgents were so exorbitant, that Norfolk rejected them;
and they prepared again to decide the contest by force of arms. They were as
formidable as ever both by their numbers and spirit; and notwithstanding a
small river, which lay between them and the royal army, Norfolk had great
rea∣son to dread the effects of their fury. But while they were preparing to
pass the ford, rain fell a second time in such abundance, as made it
impracticable for them to execute their design; and the populace, partly
reduced to necessity by the want of provisions, partly struck with
superstition at being thus again disappointed by the same accident,
suddenly dispersed themselves. The duke of Norfolk, who had received
powers for that end, forwarded the dispersion, by the promise of a
general amnesty; and the King ratified this act of clemency. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">9th of De∣cember.</NOTE> He published,
how∣ever, a manifesto against the rebels, and an answer to their
complaints; where he employed a very lofty style, suited to so haughty a
monarch. He told them, that they ought no more to pretend giving a judgment
with regard to govern∣ment, than a blind man with regard to colours: 
<Q REND="inline">"And we," he added, "with our whole council
think it right strange, that ye, who be but brutes and in∣expert folk, do
take upon you to appoint us, who be meet or not for our council."</Q></P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1537" UNIT="year"/> As this pacification was not
likely to be of long continuance, Norfolk was or∣dered to keep his army
together, and to go into the northern parts, in order to ex∣act a general
submission. Lord Darcy as well as Aske were sent for to court; and
the former, upon his refusal or delay to appear, was thrown into prison.
Every place was full of jealousy and complaints. A new insurrection broke
out, headed by Musgrave and Tilby; and the rebels besieged Carlisle with
8000 men. Being repulsed by that town, they were encountered in their retreat
by Norfolk, who put them to flight; and having made prisoners of all their
officers, except <PB N="218" REF="223"/> Musgrave, who escaped, he
instantly put them to death by martial law, to the number of seventy
persons. An attempt made by Sir Francis Bigot and Halam to surprize Hull,
met with no better success; and several other risings were
suppressed by the vigilance of Norfolk. The King, enraged by these
multiplied revolts, was determined not to adhere to the general pardon, which
he had granted; and from a movement of his usual violence, he made the
innocent suffer for the guilty. Norfolk, by command from his master,
spread the royal banner, and, wherever he thought proper, executed martial
law in the punishment of offenders. Besides Aske, leader of the first
insurrection, Sir Robert Constable, Sir John Bulmer, Sir Thomas Piercy, Sir
Stephen Hamilton, Nicholas Tempest, William Lumley, and many others, were
thrown into prison; and most of them were condemned and executed. Lord
Huffey was found guilty as an accomplice in the insurrection of
Lincolnshire, and was executed at Lincoln. Lord Darcy, tho' he pleaded
compulsion, and appealed to a long life, passed in the service of the
crown, was beheaded on Tower-hill. Before his execution, he accused Nor∣folk
of having secretly encouraged the rebels; but Henry, either sensible of
that nobleman's great services and convinced of his fidelity, or afraid to
offend one of such extensive power and great capacity, rejected the
information. Being now satiated with punishing the rebels, he published
anew a general pardon, to which he faithfully adhered<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Herbert, p. 428.</NOTE>; and he erected by patent a court of
justice at York, for deciding lawsuits to the northern counties: A demand
which had been made by the insurgents.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">12 October.</NOTE> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Birth of prince Edward, and death of Q.
Jane.</NOTE> SOON after this prosperous success against the rebels, an
event happened, which crowned Henry's joy, the birth of a son, who was
baptised under the name of Ed∣ward. Yet was not this happiness compleat:
The Queen died twelve days after<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Strype, vol.
ii. p. 5.</NOTE>. But a son had so long been ardently longed for by Henry,
and was now become so necessary, in order to prevent disputes with
regard to the succession, after the successive illegitimation of
the two Princesses, that the King's affliction was drown∣ed in his joy, and
he expressed great satisfaction on this occasion. The Prince, not six
days old, was created Prince of Wales, Duke of Cornwal, and Earl of Chester.
Sir Edward Seymour, the Queen's brother, formerly made Lord Beau∣champ, was
raised to the dignity of Earl of Hertford. Sir William Fitz Williams, high
admiral, was created Earl of Southampton; Sir William Paulet, Lord St. John;
Sir John Russel, Lord Russel.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1538" UNIT="year"/> THE suppression of the
rebels and the birth of a son, as they confirmed Henry's authority at home,
encreased his consideration among foreign princes, and made 
<PB N="219" REF="224"/> his alliance be courted by all parties. He maintained,
however, a neutrality in the wars, which were carried on, with various
success, and without any decisive event, between Charles and Francis; and
tho' inclined more to favour the latter, he was determined not to incur,
without necessity, either hazard or expence in his behalf. A truce,
concluded about this time, between these potentates, and which was afterwards
prolonged for ten years, freed him from all anxiety on ac∣count of his ally,
and re-established the tranquillity of Europe.</P>
<P>HENRY was very desirous of cementing an union with the German
protestants; and for that purpose, he sent Christopher Mount to a
congress which they held at Brunswick; but that minister made no great
progress in his negotiations. The princes desired to know, what were the
articles in their confession which Henry disliked; and they sent new
ambassadors to him, who had orders both to negotiate and to dispute. They
endeavoured to convince the King, that he was guilty of a mistake, in
administering the eucharist in one kind only, in al∣lowing of private
masses, and in requiring the celibacy of the clergy<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Collier, vol. ii. p. 145. from the Cott. Lib. Cleopatra, E. 5.
fol. 173.</NOTE>. Henry would by no means acknowlege any error in these
particulars; and was offended that they should pretend to prescribe rules
to so great a monarch and theologian. He found arguments and syllogisms
enough to defend his cause; and he dismissed the ambassadors
without coming to any conclusion. Jealous also lest his own subjects
should become such theologians as to question his tenets, he used great
precautions in publishing that translation of the scripture, which was
finished this year. He would only allow a copy of it to be deposited in
each parish church, where it was fixed by a chain: And he took care to inform
the people by proclamation, 
<Q REND="inline">"That this indulgence was not the effect of his
duty, but of his goodness and his liberality to them; who therefore should
use it mode∣rately, for the encrease of virtue, not of strife: And he
ordered that no man should read the Bible aloud, so as to disturb the
priest, while he sang mass, nor presume to expound doubtful places,
without advice from the learned."</Q> In this measure, as in the rest, he
still halted half way between the catholics and the protestants.</P>
<P>THERE was only one particular, in which Henry was quite
decisive, because he was there impelled by his avarice, or more properly
speaking, his rapacity, occasioned by profuseness: This measure was
the entire destruction of the mona∣steries. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Suppression of the greater
monasteries.</NOTE> The present opportunity seemed favourable for that
great enterprize; while the suppression of the late rebellion fortified
and encreased the royal authority; and as some of the abbots were
suspected of having encouraged the insurrection, and of corresponding
with the rebels, the King's resentment was farther incited 
<PB N="220" REF="225"/> by that motive. A new visitation was appointed of all
the monasteries in Eng∣land; and a pretence only being wanted for their
suppression, it was easy for a prince, possessed of such
exorbitant power, and seconding the present humour of a great part of the
nation, to find or feign one. The abbots and monks knew the danger, to which
they were exposed; and having learned, by the example of the lesser
monasteries, that nothing could withstand the King's will, they were most
of them induced, in expectation of better treatment, to make a voluntary
resignation of their houses. Where promises failed of effect, menaces and
even extreme violence were employed; and as several of the abbots, since
the breach with Rome, had been named by the court, with a view to this event,
the King's intentions were the more easily effectuated. Some also, having
se∣cretly embraced the doctrine of the reformation, were glad to be freed
from their vows; and on the whole, the design was conducted with such
success, that, in less than two years, the King had got
possession of all the monastic revenues.</P>
<P>IN several places, particularly in the county of Oxford, great
interest was made to preserve some convents of women, who, as they lived
in the most irreproach∣able manner, justly merited, it was thought, that
their houses should be saved from the general destruction<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. i. p. 328.</NOTE>. There appeared also great
difference between the case of nuns and friars; and the one institution
might be very laudable, while the other was exposed to much blame. The males
of all ranks, if endowed with industry, might be of service to the public;
and none of them could want em∣ployment, suited to his station and
capacity. But a woman of family, who failed of a settlement in the married
state, an accident to which such persons were more liable than women of
lower station, had really no rank which she properly filled; and a convent
was a retreat both honourable and agreeable, from the inutility and often want,
which attended her situation. But the King was determined to abo∣lish
monasteries of every denomination; and probably thought, that these antient
establishments would be the sooner forgot, that no remains of them, of
any kind, were allowed to subsist in the kingdom.</P>
<P>THE better to reconcile the people to this great innovation,
stories were pub∣lished of the detestable lives of the friars in many of
the convents; and great care was taken to defame those whom the court was
determined to ruin. The relicts also, and superstitions, which had so
long been the object of the people's venera∣tion, were exposed to their
ridicule; and the religious spirit, now less bent on ex∣terior
observances and sensible objects, was encouraged in this new direction.
It is needless to be particular in such an enumeration: Protestant
historians mention on this occasion with great triumph the sacred
repositories of convents; the par∣ings <PB N="221" REF="226"/> of St. Edmond's
toes; some of the coals that roasted St. Laurence; the girdle of the Virgin
shown in eleven several places; two or three heads of St. Ursula; the
felt of St. Thomas of Lancaster, an infallible cure for the headach; part of
St. Thomas of Canterbury's shirt, much reverenced by big bellied wo∣men;
some relicts, an excellent preventive against rain; others, a remedy to
weeds in corn. But such fooleries, as they are to be found in all ages and
na∣tions of the world, and even took place during the most refined periods of
an∣tiquity, form no peculiar nor violent reproach on the catholic religion.</P>
<P>THERE were also discovered in the monasteries some
impostures of a more ar∣tificial nature. At Hales, in the county of
Gloucester, had been shown, during several ages, the blood of Christ
brought from Jerusalem; and it is easy to ima∣gine the veneration, with
which such a relict was regarded. A miraculous cir∣cumstance also
attended this miraculous relict; the sacred blood was not visible to any
one in mortal sin, even when set before him; and till he had performed good
works sufficient for his absolution, it would not deign to discover
itself to him. At the dissolution of the monastery, the whole
contrivance was discovered. Two of the monks, who were let into the secret,
had taken the blood of a duck, which they renewed every week: They put it into
a phial, one side of which consisted of thin and transparent
chrystal, the other of thick and obscure. When any rich pilgrim arrived,
they were sure to show him the dark side of the phial, till masses
and offerings had expiated his offences; and then finding his money, or
patience, or faith, near exhausted, they made him happy by turning the
phial<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Herbert, p. 431, 432. Stowe, p. 575.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>A MIRACULOUS crucifix had been kept at Boxley in Kent, and bore
the appella∣tion of the <HI>Rood of Grace.</HI> The lips, and eyes, and head of
the image moved on the approach of its votaries. Hilsey, bishop of
Rochester, broke the crucifix at St. Paul's cross, and shewed the whole
people the springs and wheels by which it had been secretly moved. A great
wooden idol of Wales, called Darvel Ga∣therin, was also brought to London,
and cut in pieces: And by a cruel refine∣ment of vengeance, it was employed as
fuel to burn fryar Forest<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Goodwin's Annals.
Stowe, p. 575. Herbert. Baker, p. 286.</NOTE>, who was punished for denying
the supremacy, and for some pretended heresies. A finger of St. Andrew's,
covered with a thin plate of silver, had been pawned by a con∣vent for a debt
of forty pounds; but as the King's commissioners refused to re∣lease
the pawn, people made themselves very merry with the poor creditor, on
account of his security.</P>
<P>BUT of all the instruments of antient superstition, no-one
was so zealously destroyed as the shrine of Thomas a Becket, commonly
called St. Thomas of <PB N="222" REF="227"/> Canterbury. This saint owed his
canonization to the zealous defence, which he had made for the apostolic
see; and on that account also, the monks had ex∣tremely encouraged the
devotion of pilgrimages towards his tomb, and number∣less were the miracles,
which, they pretended, his relicts wrought on his devout votaries. They
raised his body once a year; and the day, on which this cere∣mony was
performed, which was called the day of his translation, was a general
holyday: Every fiftieth year there was celebrated a jubilee to his honour,
which lasted fifteen days: Plenary indulgences were then granted to all that
visited his tomb; and a hundred thousand pilgrims have been registered at
a time in Can∣terbury. The devotion towards him had quite effaced in that town
the adora∣tion of the Deity; nay, even that of the Virgin. At God's altar, for
instance, there was offered in one year three pounds two shillings and
six-pence; at the Virgin's, sixty three pounds five shillings and
six-pence; at St. Thomas's, eight hundred and thirty two pounds twelve
shillings and three-pence. But next year, the disproportion was still
greater: There was not a penny offered at God's altar; the Virgin's gained only
four pounds one shilling and eight-pence; but St. Tho∣mas had got for his
share nine hundred and fifty four pounds six shillings and
three-pence<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. i. p. 244.</NOTE>. Lewis the
seventh of France had made a pilgrimage to this miraculous tomb, and had
bestowed on the shrine a jewel, which was esteemed the richest in
Christendom. It is obvious, how obnoxious to Henry a saint of this
character must appear, and how much contrary to all his projects for
degrading the autho∣rity of the court of Rome. He not only pillaged the rich
shrine, dedicated to St. Thomas: He made the saint himself be cited to
appear in court, and be tried and condemned as a traitor: He ordered his name
to be struck out of the ca∣lender; the office for his festival to be
expunged from all breviaries; and his bones to be burned, and the ashes to be
dissipated.</P>
<P>ON the whole, the King, at different times, suppressed
six hundred and forty five monasteries: Of which twenty eight had abbots,
who enjoyed a seat in par∣liament. Ninety colleges were demolished in
several counties; two thousand three hundred and seventy four chantries
and free chappels: A hundred and ten hospitals. The whole revenue of these
establishments amounted to one hun∣dred and sixty one thousand one
hundred pounds<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Lord Herbert, Camden,
Speed.</NOTE>. It is worthy of observation, that the whole lands and
possessions of England had, a little before this period, been rated at
three millions a year; so that the revenues of the monasteries did not
really much exceed the twentieth part of the national income: A sum vastly
inferior to what is commonly apprehended. The lands belonging to the con∣vents,
<PB N="223" REF="228"/> were commonly let at very low leases; and the farmers,
who regarded themselves as a species of proprietors, took always care to
renew their leases be∣fore they expired.</P>
<P>GREAT murmurs were every where excited against these
violences; and men much questioned, whether priors and monks, who were only
trustees or tenants for life, could by any deed, however voluntary, transfer
to the King the entire pro∣perty of their estates. In order to reconcile the
people to such mighty inno∣vations, they were told, that the King would never
henceforth have occasion to levy taxes, but would be able, from the abbey
lands alone, to bear, during war as well as peace, the whole charges of the
government<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Coke's 4th Inst. fol. 44.</NOTE>. While
such topics were employed to pacify the populace, the King took an effectual
method of en∣gaging the nobility and gentry to take part with his
measures<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Dugdale's Warwickshire, p.
800.</NOTE>: He either made a gift of the revenues of convents to his
favourites and courtiers, or sold them at low prices, or exchanged them for
other lands on very disadvantageous terms. He was so profuse in these
liberalities, that he is said to have given a woman the whole revenues of a
convent, as a reward for making a pudding, which hap∣pened to gratify his
palate<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Fuller.</NOTE>. He also settled
sallaries on the abbots and priors, proportioned to their former revenues or
to their merits; and gave each monk a yearly pension of eight marks: He
erected six new bishoprics, Westminster, Oxford, Peterborow, Bristol,
Chester, and Gloucester; of which the last five subsist at this
day: And by all these means of expence and dissipation, the profit which
the King reaped by the seizure of church lands, fell much short of vulgar
opinion. As the ruin of convents had been foreseen some years ere it
hap∣pened, the monks had taken care to dissipate beforehand most of their
stock, furniture, and plate; so that the spoils of the great
monasteries bore not, in these respects, any proportion to those of the
lesser.</P>
<P>BESIDE the lands, possessed by the monasteries, the
regular clergy enjoyed a considerable part of the benefices of England, and
of the tythes, annexed to them; and these were also at this time
transferred to the crown, and by that means came into the hands of laymen: An
abuse which many zealous churchmen re∣gard as the most criminal
sacrilege. The monks were formerly much at their ease in England, and
enjoyed revenues, which much exceeded the regular and stated expence of the
house. We read of the abbey of Chertsey in Surrey, which possest 744
pounds a year, tho' it contained only fourteen monks: That of Fur∣ness, in
the county of Lincoln, was valued at 960 pounds a year, and contained but
thirty monks<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. i. p. 237.</NOTE>. In
order to dissipate their revenues, and support popularity, the
monasteries lived in a very hospitable manner; and besides the poor,
main∣tained <PB N="224" REF="229"/> from their offals, there were many decayed
gentlemen, who passed their lives in travelling from convent to convent,
and were entirely subsisted at the ta∣bles of the friars. By this
hospitality, as much as by their own inactivity, did the convents prove
nurseries of idleness; but the King, not to give offence by too sudden an
innovation, bound the new proprietors of abbey lands, to support the ancient
hospitality. But this engagement was fulfilled in very few places, and for a
very short time.</P>
<P>IT is easy to imagine the indignation with which intelligence
of all these vio∣lences was received at Rome; and how much the
ecclesiastics of that court, who had so long kept the world in
subjection by big sounding epithets, and by holy execrations, would now
vent their rhetoric against the character and conduct of Henry. The pope was
provoked at last to publish the bull, which he had passed against
that monarch; and in a public manner delivered over his soul to the de∣vil,
and his dominions to the first invader. Libels were dispersed, where he
was compared to the most furious persecutors in antiquity; and the
preference was even given on their side: He had declared war with the dead,
whom the pagans themselves respected; was at open enmity with heaven; and
had engaged in pro∣fessed hostility with the whole host of saints and
angels. Above all, he was often reproached with his resemblance to the
emperor Julian, whom, it was said, he imitated in his apostacy and
learning, tho' he fell short of him in his morals. Henry could
distinguish in many of these libels the stile and animosity of his
kinsman, Pole; and he was thence anew incited to vent his rage, by every
pos∣sible expedient, on that famous cardinal.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cardinal Pole.</NOTE> REGINALD de la Pole, or
Reginald Pole, was descended of the royal family, being fourth son of the
countess of Salisbury, daughter of the duke of Clarence. He discovered in
very early youth evident symptoms of that fine genius, and ge∣nerous
disposition, by which, during his whole life, he was so much
distinguish∣ed; and Henry having conceived great friendship for him,
proposed to raise him to the highest ecclesiastical dignities; and,
as a pledge of future favours, he con∣ferred on him the deanry of Exeter<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Goodwin's Annals.</NOTE>, in order to help him to bear the
expences of his education. Pole was carrying on his studies in Paris, at the
time when the King sollicited the suffrages of that university in favour
of his divorce; but tho' applied to by the English agent, he declined taking
any part in that affair. Henry bore this neglect with more temper than was
natural to him; and he ap∣peared unwilling, on that account, to renounce
friendship with a person, whose virtues and talents, he hoped, would
prove useful, as well as ornamental, to his court and kingdom. He allowed him
still to possess his deanry, and gave him <PB N="225" REF="230"/>
permission to finish his studies at Padua: He even paid him some
court, in order to bring him into his measures; and wrote to him, while in
Italy, desiring him to give his opinion freely, with regard to the late
measures taken in England, for abolishing the papal authority. Pole had now
entered into an intimate friendship with whatever was eminent for dignity or
merit in Italy; Sadolet, Bembo, and other revivers of true taste and
learning; and he was moved by these connections, as well as by religious
zeal, to forget, in some respect, the duty which he owed to Henry, his
benefactor, and his sovereign. He replied, by writing a treatise of <HI>the
unity of the church,</HI> where he inveighed against the King's supremacy,
his divorce, his second marriage; and even exhorted the em∣peror to revenge
on him the injury done to his family, and to the catholic cause. Henry, tho'
provoked beyond measure at this outrage, dissembled his resent∣ment;
and sent a message to Pole, desiring him to return to England, in order
to explain certain passages in his book, which he found somewhat
obscure and difficult: But Pole was on his guard against this insidious
invitation; and was determined to remain in Italy, where he was extremely
beloved and esteemed by all the world.</P>
<P>THE pope and emperor thought themselves obliged to provide for
a man of Pole's eminence and dignity, who, in support of their cause, had
sacrificed all his pretensions to fortune in his own country. He was
created a cardinal; and tho' he never took higher orders than those of a
deacon, he was sent legate into Flanders about the year 1536<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Herbert.</NOTE>. Henry was sensible, that Pole's chief
intention in choosing that employment, was to foment the mutinous
disposition of the English catholics; and he therefore remonstrated in
such a vigorous manner with the queen of Hungary, regent of the Low
Countries, that she dismissed the legate, without allowing him to
exercise his commission. The enmity which he bore Pole, was now open, as
well as violent; and the cardinal, on his part, kept no farther measures in
his intrigues against Henry. He is even suspected of aspiring to the
crown, by means of a marriage with the lady Mary; and the King was every day
alarmed by informations, which he received, of the correspondence maintain∣ed
in England by that fugitive. Courtney, marquis of Exeter, had entered into a
conspiracy with him; Sir Edward Nevil, brother to the lord Abergavenny, Sir
Nicholas Carew, master of horse, and knight of the garter; Henry de la
Pole, lord Montacute, and Sir Geoffrey de la Pole, brothers to the cardinal.
These persons were indicted, and tried, and convicted, before lord Audley,
who pre∣sided in the trial, as lord high steward. They were all executed,
except Sir Geoffrey de la Pole, who was pardoned; and he owed this grace to his
having <PB N="226" REF="231"/> first carried to the King secret intelligence
of the conspiracy▪ We know little of the justice or iniquity of the
sentence pronounced against these men▪ We only know, that the
condemnation of a man, who was, at that time, prosecuted by the court, forms
no presumption of his guilt; tho' as no historian of credit mentions, in
the present case, any complaints occasioned by these trials, we may
presume, that sufficient evidence was produced against the marquis of
Exeter, and his associates<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Herbert in

</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE rough hand of Henry seemed well adapted for rending
asunder those bands, by which the ancient superstition had fastened
itself on the king∣dom; and tho', after renouncing the pope's supremacy,
and suppressing monaste∣ries, most of the political ends of a
reformation were already attained, few people expected, that he would stop at
those innovations. The spirit of opposition, it was thought, would carry
him to the utmost extremity against the church of Rome; and lead him to
declare war against the whole doctrine and worship, as well as
discipline, of that mighty hierarchy. He had formerly appealed from the pope
to a general council; but now, that a general council was summoned to meet at
Mantua, he previously renounced all submission to it, as being
summon∣ed by the pope, and lying entirely under subjection to that
spiritual usurper. He engaged his clergy to make a declaration to the like
purpose; and he had pre∣scribed to them many other alterations on ancient
tenets and practices. Cranmer took advantage of every opportunity to carry him
on in this course; and while Queen Jane lived, who favoured the reformers, he
had, by means of her insinua∣tion and address, been very successful in
his endeavours. After her death, Gar∣diner, <PB N="227" REF="232"/> who was
returned from his embassy to France, kept the King more in sus∣pence;
and by feigning an unlimited submission to his will, he was frequently
able to guide him to his own purposes. Fox, bishop of Hereford, had
supported Cran∣mer in his schemes for a more entire reformation; but his
death had made way for the promotion of Bonner, who, tho' he had hitherto
seemed a furious enemy to the see of Rome, was determined to sacrifice
every thing to present interest, and had joined the confederacy of Gardiner
and the partizans of the old religion. Gar∣diner himself, it was believed,
had secretly entered into measures with the pope, and even with the
emperor; and in concert with these powers, he endeavoured to preserve, as
much as possible, the ancient faith and worship.</P>
<P>HENRY was so much governed by passion, that nothing could
have retarded his animosity and opposition against Rome, but some other
passion, which stopped his career, and raised him new subjects of
animosity. Tho' he had gradually, since he came to years of maturity, been
changing the tenets of that theological system, in which he had been
educated, he was equally positive and dogmatical in the few articles which
remained to him, as if the whole fabric had continued entire and unshaken:
And tho' he stood alone in his opinion, the flattery of courtiers had so
enflamed his tyrannical arrogance, that he thought himself enti∣tled to
regulate, by his own particular standard, the religious faith of the whole
nation. The point, where he chiefly placed his orthodoxy, happened to be the
real presence; that very doctrine, in which, among the numberless victories
of superstition over common sense, her triumph is the most signal
and egregious. All departure from this principle he held to be heretical and
detestable; and no∣thing, he thought, would be more honourable for him, than,
while he broke off all connections with the Roman pontiff, to maintain, in this
essential article, the purity of the catholic faith.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Disputation with Lam∣bert.</NOTE> THERE was
one Lambert<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Fox, vol. II. p. 396.</NOTE>, a
school-master in London, who had been ques∣tioned for unsound opinions
by archbishop Warham; but, upon the death of that prelate, and the changing
of councils at court, he had been released. Not terrified with the danger
which he had incurred, he still continued to pro∣mulgate his tenets; and
having heard Dr. Taylor, afterwards bishop of Lin∣coln, defend in a sermon
the corporal presence, he could not forbear expressing to Taylor his
dissent from that doctrine; and he drew up his objections under ten
several head. Taylor carried the paper to Dr. Barnes, who happened to be a
Lutheran, and who maintained, that, tho' the substance of bread and wine
remained in the sacrament, yet the real body and blood of Christ were there
also, and were, in a certain mysterious manner, incorporated with the
material ele∣ments. <PB N="228" REF="233"/> By the present laws and practice,
Barnes was no less exposed to the stake than Lambert; yet such was the
persecuting rage which prevailed, that he was determined to bring this man to
condign punishment; because, in their common departure from the ancient
faith, he had dared to go one step farther than him∣self. He engaged Taylor
to delate Lambert to Cranmer and Latimer, who, whatever their private opinion
might be on these points, were obliged to conform themselves to the
standard of orthodoxy, established by Henry. When Lambert was cited
before these prelates, they endeavoured to bend him to a recantation; and
they were surprized, when, instead of compliance, he ventured to appeal to
the King.</P>
<P>THE King, not displeased with an opportunity, where he could
at once exert his supremacy, and display his learning, accepted the appeal;
and was deter∣mined to mix, in a very unfair manner, the disputant with the
judge. Public notice was given, that he intended to enter the lists with this
school-master: Scaffolds were erected in Westminster-hall, for the
accommodation of the audi∣ence: Henry appeared on his throne, accompanied with
all the ensigns of ma∣jesty: The prelates were placed on his right hand:
The temporal peers on his left. The judges and most eminent lawyers had a
place assigned them behind the bishops: The courtiers of greatest
distinction behind the peers: And in the midst of this splendid
assembly was produced the unhappy Lambert, and he was required to defend
his opinions against his royal antagonist<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Fox, vol. II. p. 426.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE bishop of Chichester opened the conference, by saying,
that Lambert, being charged with heretical pravity, had appealed from his
bishop to the King; as if he expected more favour from this application, and
as if the King could ever be induced to protect a heretic: That tho' his
majesty had thrown off the usur∣pations of the see of Rome; had
disincorporated some idle monks, who lived like drones in a beehive; had
remedied the idolatrous worship of images; had published the bible in
English, for the instruction of all his subjects; and had made some
lesser alterations, which every one must approve of; yet was he
de∣termined to maintain the purity of the catholic faith, and to punish with
the ut∣most severity all departure from it: And that he had taken the
present opportu∣nity, before so learned and grave an auditory, of
convincing Lambert of his er∣rors; but if he still persevered obstinately
in them, he must expect the most con∣dign punishment<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Goodwin's Annals.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>AFTER this preamble, which was not very encouraging, the King
asked Lam∣bert, with a stern countenance, what his opinion was of
Christ's corporal pre∣sence in the sacrament of the altar; and when
Lambert began his discourse with <PB N="229" REF="234"/> some compliment
to his majesty, he rejected the praise with disdain and indigna∣tion. He
afterwards pressed Lambert with some arguments, drawn from scrip∣ture
and the schoolmen: The audience applauded the force of his reasoning, and
the extent of his erudition: Cranmer seconded his proofs by some new
topics: Gardiner entered the lists as a support to Cranmer: Tonstal took
up the argument after Gardiner: Stokesley brought fresh aid to Tonstal:
Six bishops more appeared successively in the field after Stockesley.
And the disputation, if it deserves the name, was prolonged for five hours;
till Lambert, fatigued, con∣founded, brow-beaten, and abashed, was at last
reduced to silence. The King then, returning to the charge, asked him
whether he was convinced; and he proposed, as a concluding argument, this
interesting question, whether he was resolved to live or die? Lambert,
who possessed that courage which consists in obstinacy, replied,
that he cast himself wholly on his majesty's clemency: The King told him,
that he would be no protector of heretics; and therefore, if that was his final
answer, he must expect to be committed to the flames. Cromwel, as
vicegerent, read the sentence against him<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Collier,
in his ecclesiastical history, vol. II. p. 152, has preserved an
account which Cromwel gave of this conference, in a letter to Sir Thomas Wyat,
the King's embassador in Germany. 
<Q REND="inline">"The King's majesty," says Cromwel, "for
the reverence of the holy sacrament of the altar, did sit openly in his
hall, and there presided at the disputation, process and judgment of a
miserable here∣tic sacramentary, who was burned the 20th of November. It
was a wonder to see how princely, with how excellent gra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ity, and inestimable majesty his highness
exercised there the very office of supreme head of the church of England.
How benignly his grace essayed to convert the miserable man: How strong
and manifest reasons his highness alledged against him. I wish the
princes and potentates of Christendom to have had a meet place to have seen
it. Undoubtedly they should have much marvelled at his majesty's most
high wisdom and judgment, and reputed him no other wise after the same,
than in a manner the mirror and light of all other Kings and princes in
Christendom."</Q> It was by such flatteries, that Henry was engaged to make
his sentiments the standard to all mankind; and was determined to enforce,
by the severest penalties, his <HI>strong and manifest</HI> reasons
for transub∣stantiation.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>LAMBERT, whose vanity had probably incited him the more to
persevere on account of the greatness of this public appearance, was not
daunted by the ter∣rors of that punishment, to which he was condemned. His
executioners took care to make the sufferings of a man who had personally
opposed the King, as cruel as possible: He was burned at a slow fire;
his legs and thighs were con∣sumed to the stumps; and when there appeared
no end of his tortures, some of the guards, more merciful than the rest,
lifted him on their halberts, and threw him into the flames, where he was
consumed. While they were employed in this <PB N="230" REF="235"/> friendly
office, he cried aloud several times, <HI>None but Christ, none but
Christ,</HI> and these words were in his mouth when he expired<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Fox's acts and monuments, p. 427. Burnet.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>SOME few days before this execution, four Dutch anabaptists,
three men and a woman, had faggots tied to their backs at Paul's cross▪
and were burned in that manner. And a man and a woman of the same sect and
country, were burned in Smithfield<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Stowe, p.
556.</NOTE></P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1539" UNIT="year"/> IT was the unhappy situation
of the English, during that age, that when they laboured under any grievance,
they had not the satisfaction of expecting redress from Parliament: On the
contrary, they had reason to dread each meeting of that assembly, and
were then sure of having tyranny converted into law, and ag∣gravated,
perhaps, with some circumstance, which the arbitrary prince and his
ministers had not hitherto devised, or did not think proper, of
themselves, to carry into execution. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Parliament.</NOTE> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">28th April.</NOTE> This abject servility
never more eminently appeared than in a new Parliament, which the King now
assembled, and which, if he had so pleased, might have been the last
that ever sat in England. But he found them too useful instruments of
dominion ever to entertain thoughts of giving them a total exclusion.</P>
<P>THE chancellor opened the Parliament by informing the house of
Lords, that it was his majesty's earnest desire, to extirpate from his
kingdom all diversity of opinions with regard to religion; and as this
enterprize was difficult and impor∣tant, he desired them to chuse a
committee among themselves, who might frame certain articles, and communicate
them afterwards to the Parliament. The lords named the vicar-general, Cromwel,
now created a peer, the archbishops of Can∣terbury and York, the bishops of
Durham, Carlisle, Worcester, Bath and Wells, Bangor, and Ely. The house
might have seen what a hopeful task they were undertaking: This small
committee itself was agitated with such diversity of opi∣nions, that it
could come to no conclusion. The duke of Norfolk then moved in the house,
that, since there were no hopes of having a report from the com∣mittee, the
articles of faith, proposed to be established, should be reduced to
six; and new committees be appointed to frame an act with regard to them. As
this peer was understood to speak the King's mind, his motion was
immediately as∣sented to; and, after a short prorogation, the bill of the
<HI>six articles,</HI> or the bloody bill, as the protestants justly
termed it, was introduced, and having passed the two houses, had the
King's assent affixed to it.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Law of the six articles.</NOTE> IN this
law, the real presence was established, the communion in one kind, the
perpetual obligation of vows of chastity, the utility of private masses,
the <PB N="231" REF="236"/> celibacy of the clergy, the necessity of
auricular confession. The denial of the first article, with regard to the
real presence, subjected the person to death by fire, and to the same
forfeiture as in cases of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>reason; and admitted not the pri∣vilege of abjuring: An unheard
of severity, and unknown to the inquisition it∣self. The denial of any of
the other five articles, even tho' recanted, was pu∣nishable by the
forfeiture of goods and chattels, and imprisonment during the King's
pleasure: An obstinate adherence to error, or a relapse, was adjudged to
be felony, and punishable with death. The marriage of priests was
subjected to the same punishment: Their commerce with women, for the
first offence, was forfeiture and imprisonment; for the second, death.
Abstaining from confes∣sion, and from receiving the eucharist at the
accustomed times, subjected the person to fine and imprisonment, during
the King's pleasure; and if the crimi∣nal persevered after conviction, he
was punishable by death and forseiture, as in cases of felony<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">31 Hen. VIII. c. 14. Herbert in Kennet, p. 219.</NOTE>.
Commissioners were to be appointed by the King, for en∣quiring into these
heresies and irregular practices, and the criminals were to be tried by a
jury.</P>
<P>THE King, in framing this law, laid his oppressive hand on
both parties; and even the catholics had reason to complain, that the friars
and nuns, tho' dis∣missed their convent, should be capriciously
restrained to the practice of celibacy<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">There
is a story, that the duke of Norfolk, meeting, soon after this act was
passed, one of his chaplains, who was suspected of favouring the
reformation, said to him, 
<Q REND="inline">"Now, Sir, what think you of the law to hinder
priests from having wives?"</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">"Yes, my lord," replies the chaplain, "you
have done that; but I will answer for it, you cannot hinder men's wives from
having priests."</Q></NOTE>: But as the protestants were chiefly exposed
to the severity of the act, the misery of adversaries, according to the
usual maxims of party, was regarded by the adherents to the ancient religion,
as their own prosperity and triumph. Cran∣mer had the courage to oppose
this bill in the house; and tho' the King desired him to absent
himself, he could not be prevailed on to give this proof of com∣pliance<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. I. p. 249, 270. Fox, vol. II. p.
1037.</NOTE>. Henry was accustomed to Cranmer's freedom and sincerity; and
being convinced of the general rectitude of his intentions, gave him an
unusual indulgence in that particular, and never allowed even a whisper
against him. That prelate, however, was now obliged, in obedience to the
statute, to dismiss his wife, the niece of Osiander, a famous divine of
Nuremburg<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Herbert in Kennet, p. 210</NOTE>; and
Henry, satisfied with this proof of submission, showed him his former
countenance and favour. La∣timer and Shaxton threw up their bishoprics, on
account of this law, and were committed to prison.</P>
<P><PB N="232" REF="237"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Proclamations made equal to laws.</NOTE> THE
Parliament having thus resigned all their ecclesiastical liberties,
proceeded to an entire surrender of their civil; and without scruple or
deliberation they made by one act a total subversion of the English
constitution. They gave to the King's proclamations the same force as to a
statute enacted by Parliament; and to render the matter worse, if
possible, they framed this law as if it were only declarative, and were
intended to explain the natural extent of the regal authority. The preamble
contains, that the King had formerly set forth several proclamations, which
froward persons had wilfully contemned, not considering what a King by his
royal power may do; that this licence might encourage offen∣ders not only to
disobey the laws of Almighty God, but also to dishonour the King's most
royal majesty, <HI>who may full ill bear it;</HI> that sudden emergencies
often occur, which require speedy remedies, and cannot await the slow
assem∣bling and deliberations of Parliament; and that, tho' the King was
empowered, by his authority, derived from God, to consult the public good on
these occasi∣ons, yet the opposition of refractory subjects might
push him to extremity and violence: For these reasons, the Parliament,
that they might remove all occa∣sion of doubt, ascertained by a statute
this prerogative of the crown, and en∣abled his majesty, with the advice of
his council, to set forth proclamations, en∣joining obedience under whatever
pains and penalties he shall think proper: And these proclamations were to
have the force of perpetual laws<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">31 Hen. VIII.
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. 8.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WHAT shows either a stupid or wilful blindness of the
Parliament; they pre∣tended, even after this statute, to maintain some
limitations in the government; and they enacted, that no proclamation should
deprive any person of his lawful possessions, liberties,
inheritances, privileges, franchises; nor yet infringe any common law or
laudable custom of the realm. They considered not, that no pains could be
inflicted on the disobedience of proclamations, without invading some
liberty or property of the subject; and that the power of enacting new laws,
joined to the dispensing power, then exercised by the crown, amounted to
a full legislative authority. It is true, the Kings of England had been
always ac∣customed, from their own authority, to issue proclamations, and
to exact obedi∣ence to them; and this prerogative was, no doubt, a strong
symptom of abso∣lute government: But still there was a difference between
a power, which was exercised on a particular emergence, and which must be
justified by the present expediency or necessity; and an authority
conferred by a positive statute, which could no longer admit of controul or
limitation.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Settlement of the succession.</NOTE>
COULD any act be more opposite to the spirit of liberty than this law, it
would have been another of the same parliament. They passed attainders,
not only <PB N="233" REF="238"/> against the Marquess of Exeter, the Lords
Montacute, Darcy, Hussey, and others, who had been legally tried and
condemned; but also against some persons, of the highest quality, who
had never been accused, or examined, or convicted. The violent hatred, which
Henry bore to cardinal Pole, had extended itself to all his friends and
relations; and his mother in particular, the countess of Salis∣bury, had,
on that account, become extremely obnoxious to him. She was also accused of
having employed her authority with her tenants, to hinder them from perusing
the new translation of the Bible; of having procured bulls from Rome, which,
'tis said, were found at Coudray, her country seat; of having kept a
cor∣respondence with her son, the cardinal: But Henry found, either that
these of∣fences could not be proved, or that they would not by law be
subject to such se∣vere punishment as he desired to inflict upon her.
He resolved, therefore, to pro∣ceed against her in a more summary and
more tyrannical manner; and for that purpose, he sent Cromwel, who was but
too obsequious to his will, to demand of the judges, whether the Parliament
could attaint a person, who was forth∣coming, without giving him any trial,
or citing him to appear before them<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Coke's 4th Inst.
p. 37, 38.</NOTE>. The judges replied, that it was a dangerous question, and
that the high court of Parliament ought to give examples to inferior courts of
proceeding according to justice: No inferior court could act in that
arbitrary manner, and they thought that the parliament never would. Being
pressed to give a more explicite answer, they replied, that, if a
person were attainted in that manner, the attainder could never after be
brought in question, but must remain good in law. Henry learned by this
decision, that such a method of proceeding, tho' directly contrary to all
the principles of equity, was yet practicable; and this being all he was
anxious to know, he resolved to employ it against the countess of
Salisbury. Cromwel showed to the house of peers a banner, on which was
embroidered the five wounds of Christ, the symbol, chosen by the northern
rebels; and this banner, he af∣firmed, was found in the Countess's
house<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Rymer xiv. 652.</NOTE>. No other proof
seems to have been produced, in order to ascertain her guilt: The
Parliament, without farther en∣quiry, passed a bill of attainder against
her; and they involved in the same act, without any better proof, as far as
appears, Gertrude Marchioness of Exeter, Sir Adrian Fortescue, and Sir
Thomas Dingley. These two gentlemen were executed: The marchioness was
pardoned, and survived the King; the countess received a reprieve.</P>
<P>THE only beneficial act, passed this session, was that
by which the parliament confirmed the surrender of the monasteries; and yet
even this act contains much falshood, much tyranny, and were it not that all
private rights must submit to <PB N="234" REF="239"/> public interest,
much injustice and iniquity. The scheme of engaging the abbots▪ to
make a surrender of their monasteries had been conducted, as may easily
be imagined, with many invidious circumstances: Arts of all kinds had been
em∣ployed upon them; every motive, that could work on the frailty of human
nature, had been set before them; and it was with great difficulty that
these dignified con∣ventuals were brought to a concession, which most
of them regarded as destructive of their interests, as well as sacr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>legious and criminal in itself<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Collier,
vol. ii. p. 158. &amp; seq.</NOTE>. Three abbots had shown more constancy
than the rest, the abbot of Colchester, of Reading, and of Glassenbury;
and in order to punish them for their opposition, and make them an example
to others, means had been found to convict them of treason; they had
perished by the hands of the executioner, and the revenues of the con∣vents
had been forfeited<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">31 II. VIII. c. 10.</NOTE>.
Besides, tho' none of these violences had had place, the King knew, that a
surrender made by men, who were only tenants for life, would not bear
examination; and he was therefore resolved to make all sure by his usual
expedient, an act of parliament. In the preamble to this act, the par∣liament
asserts, that all the surrenders, made by the abbots, had been, 
<Q REND="inline">"without constraint, of their own accord, and
according to the due course of common law."</Q> And in consequence, the
parliament confirms the surrenders, and ascer∣tains the property of the
abbey lands to the King and his successors for ever<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">31 H. VIII. c. 13.</NOTE>▪ It is remarkable, that all the
mitred abbots still sat in the house of peers; and that none of them made
any protestation against this statute.</P>
<P>IN this session, the rank of all the great officers of
state was fixed: Cromwel, as vicegerent, had the precedency assigned him
above all of them. It was thought singular, that a black-smith's son, for
he was no other, should have precedence next the royal family; and that a man
possessed of no manner of literature, should be placed at the head of
the church.</P>
<P>AS soon as the act of the six articles had passed, the
catholics were extremely vigilant to inform against offenders; and no less
than five hundred persons were in a little time thrown into prison. But
Cromwel, who had not had interest enough to prevent that act, was able, for
the present, to elude its execution. Seconded by the Duke of Suffolk, and
lord chancellor Audley, as well as Cranmer, he remonstrated against the
cruelty of punishing so many delinquents; and he obtained permission to
set them at liberty. The uncertainty of the King's humour gave each party an
opportunity of triumphing in its turn. No sooner had Henry passed this
law, which seemed to give so deep a wound to the reformers, than he granted
a general permission, for every one to have the new translation of the 
<PB N="235" REF="240"/> Bible in his family: A concession regarded by that
party, as a most important victory.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Henry's pro∣jects of mar∣riage.</NOTE> BUT as
Henry was observed to be much governed by his wives, while he retained his
fondness for them, the final prevalence of either party, seemed to depend
much on the choice of the future Queen. Immediately after the death of Jane
Seymour, the most beloved of all his wives, he began to think of a new
marriage. He first cast his eye on the dutchess dowager of Milan, niece
to the Emperor; and he made proposals for obtaining that alliance. But
meeting with difficulties in this design, he was carried, by his friendship
for Francis, rather to think of a French princess. He demanded the dutchess
dowager of Longueville, daughter of the Duke of Guise, a prince of the
house of Lorraine; but Francis told him, that that lady was already betrothed
to the King of Scotland. The King, however, would not take a repulse: He had
set his heart extremely on the match: The information, which he had received,
of the dutchess's accomplishments and beauty, had prepossessed him
in her favour; and having privately sent over Meautys to examine her
person, and get certain intelligence of her conduct, the accounts, which that
agent brought him, served farther to inflame his desires. He learned, that
she was big made; and he thought her, on that account, the more proper match
for him, who was now become somewhat corpulent. The pleasure too of
mortifying his nephew, whom he did not love, was a farther incitement to his
prosecution of this match; and he insisted, that Francis should give
him the pre∣ference to the King of Scots. But Francis, tho' sensible that
the alliance of Eng∣land was of much greater importance to his interest,
would not affront his friend and ally; and to prevent farther sollicitation,
he immediately sent the Princess to Scotland. Not to shock, however,
Henry's humour, Francis made him an offer of Mary of Bourbon, daughter of the
Duke of Vendome; but as the King was in∣formed, that James had formerly
rejected this Princess, he would not hear any farther of such a proposal.
The French monarch then offered him the choice of the two younger sisters
of the new Queen of Scots; and he assured him, that they were no way
inferior either in merit or size to their elder sister, and that one of
them was even superior in beauty. The King was as scrupulous with regard to
the person of his wives, as if his heart had been really susceptible of a
deli∣cate passion; and he was unwilling to trust any relations, or even
pictures, with regard to this important particular. He proposed to Francis,
that they should have a conference at Calais on pretence of business; and
that that monarch should bring along with h m the two Princesses of
Guise, together with the finest ladies of quality in France, that he might
make a choice among them. But the gal∣lante spirit of Francis was shocked
with this proposal; and he was impressed with <PB N="236" REF="241"/> too
much regard for the fair sex, to carry ladies of the first quality, like
geldings, to a market, there to be chosen or rejected by the humour of the
merchant<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Le Grand, vol. iii. p. 638.</NOTE>. Henry
would hearken to none of these niceties, but still insisted on his
proposal; which, however, notwithstanding Francis's earnest desire of
continuing a good correspondence with him, was at last finally
rejected.</P>
<P>THE King began then to turn his thoughts towards a German
alliance; and as the princes of the Smalcaldic league were extremely
disgusted against the Emperor on account of the persecution of their
religion, he hoped, by matching himself into one of their families, to renew
an amity, which he regarded as so useful to him. Cromwel joyfully
seconded this intention; and propo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed to him Anne of Cleves, whose father, the duke of that name,
had great interest among the Lutheran prin∣ces, and whose sister,
Sibylla, was married to the elector of Saxony, the head of the protestant
alliance. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">He marries Anne of Cleves.</NOTE> A flattering
picture, drawn for the Princess by Hans Holben, determined Henry to apply to
her father; and after some negotiations, the marriage, notwithstanding the
opposition of the elector of Saxony, was at last concluded; and the
Princess was sent over into England. The King, impatient to be satisfied
with regard to the person of his bride, came privately to Rochester, and
got a sight of her. He found her big, indeed, and tall, as he could wish;
but utterly devoid both of beauty and grace; very unlike the pictures and
re∣presentations, which he had received: He swore she was a great
Flanders-mare; and declared, that he never could possibly bear her any
affection. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dislikes her.</NOTE> The matter was worse,
when he found, that she could speak no language but Dutch, of which he was
entirely ignorant; and that the charms of her conversation were not likely to
compensate for the homeliness of her person. He returned to Greenwich
very melancholy; and much lamented his hard fate to Cromwel, as well as to Lord
Russel, Sir Anthony Brown, and Sir Anthony Denny. This last gentle∣man,
in order to give him comfort, told him, that his misfortune was common to
Kings, who could not, like private persons, choose for themselves; but
must receive their wives from the judgment and fancy of others.</P>
<P>IT was the subject of debate among the King's counsellors,
whether the mar∣riage could not yet be broke; and the Princess be sent back
to her own country. Henry's situation seemed at that time very critical.
After the ten years truce, concluded between the Emperor and the king of
France, a good understanding seemed to have taken place between these
rival monarchs; and such marks of union appeared, as gave great jealousy to
the court of England. The Emperor, who knew the generous nature of Francis,
even put a confidence in him, which is rare, to that degree, among great
princes. An insurrection had been raised in the Low <PB N="237" REF="242"/>
Countries by the inhabitants of Ghent, and seemed to threaten the most
danger∣ous consequences. Charles, who resided at that time in Spain,
resolved to go in person to Flanders, in order to appease these
disorders; but he found great difficulties in contriving the manner of his
passage thither. The road by Italy and Germany was tedious: The voyage
thro' the Channel dangerous, by reason of the English naval power: He
asked Francis's permission to pass thro' his dominions; and he
entrusted himself into the hands of a rival, whom he had so mortally
offended. The French monarch received him at Paris, with great magnificence and
cour∣tesy; and tho' prompted both by revenge and interest, as well as by
the advice of his mistress and favourites, to make advantage of the
present opportunity, he conducted the Emperor safely out of his dominions;
and would not so much as speak to him of business during his abode in
France, lest his demands should bear the air of violence upon his royal
guest.</P>
<P>HENRY, who was informed of all these particulars, believed
that an entire and cordial union had taken place between these two great
monarchs; and that their religious zeal might prompt them to fall with combined
arms upon Eng∣land<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Stowe, p. 579.</NOTE>. An alliance
with the German princes seemed now, more than ever, re∣quisite for his
interest and safety; and he knew, that, if he sent back the Prin∣cess
of Cleves, such an affront would be highly resented by her friends and
fa∣mily. <MILESTONE N="1540" UNIT="year"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">6 January.</NOTE> He was therefore resolved,
notwithstanding his aversion to her, to com∣plete the marriage; and he told
Cromwel, that, since matters had gone so far, he must put his neck into
the yoke. Cromwel, who knew how much his own interest was concerned in this
affair, was very anxious to learn from the King, next morning after the
marriage, whether he now liked his spouse any better. The King told him,
that he hated her worse than ever; and that her person was more lothsome
on a near approach: He was resolved never to meddle with her; and even
suspected her not to be a true maid: A point, about which he had
entertained an extreme delicacy. He continued however to be civil to Anne; he
even seemed to repose his usual confidence in Cromwel; but tho' he
exerted this command over his temper, a discontent lay lurking in his
breast, and was ready to burst out on the first opportunity.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">12 April.</NOTE> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Parliament.</NOTE> A session of
Parliament was held; and none of the abbots were now allowed a place in the
house of peers. The King, by the mouth of the chancellor, com∣plained to the
Parliament of the great diversity of religions, which still pre∣vailed
among his subjects: A grievance, he said, which ought the less to be
en∣dured; because the s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>riptures were now published in English, and ought
uni∣versally to be the standard of belief to all mankind. But he had
appointed, he <PB N="238" REF="243"/> said, some bishops and divines to
draw up a list of tenets, to which his people were to assent; and he was
determined, that Christ, the doctrine of Christ, and the truth should
have the victory. The King seems to have expected more effect in
ascertaining truth, from this new book of his doctors, than had ensued from
the publication of the scriptures. Cromwel, as vicar general, made also in
the King's name a speech to the upper house; and the peers, in return,
bestowed such flattery on him, that they said he was worthy, by his
desert, to be vicar ge∣neral of the universe. That minister seemed to
be no less in his master's good graces: He received, soon after the
sitting of the Parliament, the title of Earl of Essex, and was
installed knight of the garter.</P>
<P>THERE remained only one religious order in England; the knights
of St. John of Jerusalem, or the knights of Malta, as they are commonly
called. This or∣der, partly ecclesiastical, partly military, had, by their
valour, done great ser∣vice to Christendom; and had very much retarded, at
Jerusalem, Rhodes, and Malta, the rapid progress of the barbarians. During
the general surrender of the religious houses in England, they had exerted
their spirit, and had obsti∣nately refused to yield up their revenues to
the King; and Henry, who would endure no society that professed obedience
to the pope, was obliged to have re∣course to the Parliament for the
dissolution of this order. Their revenues were large; and formed an
addition no way contemptible to the many acquisitions, which the King had
already made. But he had very ill husbanded the great revenue obtained by the
plunder of the church: His profuse generosity dissi∣pated faster than
this rapacity could supply; and the Parliament were surprized this
session to find a new demand made upon them of four tenths and a
subsidy of one shil ing in the pound during two years: So ill were the
people's expec∣tations answered, that the crown was never more to require any
supply from the people. The commons, tho' lavish of their liberty, and of
the blood of their fellow subjects, were extremely frugal of their money; and
it was not without difficulty that that grant could be obtained by this
absolute and dreaded monarch. The convocation gave the King four shillings
in the pound to be levied in two years. The pretext for these grants was the
great expence, which Henry had been put to for the defence of the nation, in
building forts along the sea coast, and in equipping a navy. As he had at
present no ally on the Continent, in whom he reposed much confidence, he
relied only on his domestic strength, and was on that account obliged to be
more expensive in his preparations against the dangers of an
invasion.</P>
<P>THE King's favour to Cromwel, and his acquiescence in the
marriage of Anne of Cleves, were b th of them deceitful appearances: His
aversion to the Queen secretly encreased every day; and having at last
broke all restraint, it prompted <PB N="239" REF="244"/> him at once to seek
the dissolution of a marriage so odious to him, and to in∣volve his
minister in ruin, who had been the author of it. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fall of Crom∣well.</NOTE> The fall of Cromwel
was hastened by other causes. All the nobility hated a man, who, being of
such base extraction, had not only mounted above them by his station of
vicar ge∣neral, but had engrossed many of the other considerable offices
of the kingdom: Besides that commission, which gave him a high, and
almost absolute authority over the clergy, and even over the laity, he was
Lord privy seal, Lord cham∣berlain, and Master of the wards: He had also
obtained the order of the garter, a dignity which had ever been conferred only
on the most illustrious families, and which seemed to be profaned by its
being communicated to so mean a per∣son. The people were averse to him,
as the supposed author of the violences on the monasteries;
establishments, which were still revered and beloved by the commonalty.
The catholics regarded him as the concealed enemy of their reli∣gion: The
protestants, observing his exterior concurrence with all the
persecu∣tions exercised against them, were inclined to bear him as little
favour; and re∣proached him with the timidity, if not treachery, of his
conduct. And the King, who found, that great clamours had on all hands arifen
against the administra∣tion, was not displeased to throw on Cromwel the
load of public hatred, and he hoped, by so easy a sacrisice, to regain
the affections of his subjects.</P>
<P>BUT there was another cause, which suddenly set all
these motives in action, and brought about an unexpected revolution in the
ministry. The King had fixed his affection on Catherine Howard, niece to the
Duke of Norfolk; and be∣ing determined to gratify this new passion, he
could find no other expedient but by procuring a divorce from his present
consort, to raise Catherine to his bed and throne. The Duke, who had long
been engaged in enmity with Cromwel, made the same use of her
insinuations, to ruin that minister, that he had formerly done of Anne
Boleyn's against Wolsey: And when all engines were prepared, he obtained a
commission from the King, to arrest Cromwel at the council-board on the
accusation of high treason, and to commit him to the Tower. Immediately
after, a bill of attainder was framed against him; and the house of peers
thought proper, without trial, examination, or evidence, to condemn to death a
man, whom, a few days before, they had declared worthy to be vicar general of
the universe. The house of commons passed the bill, tho' not without
some oppo∣sition. Cromwel was accused of heresy and treason; but the
instances of his treasonable practices are utterly improbable, or even
absolutely ridiculous<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. i. p. 278.</NOTE>.
The only circumstance of his conduct, by which he seems to have merited
this fate, <PB N="240" REF="245"/> was his being the instrument of the King's
tyranny, in conducting like iniquitous bills, in the former session,
against the countess of Salisbury and others.</P>
<P>CROMWEL endeavoured to soften the King by the most humble
s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pplications; but all to no
purpose: It was not the practice of that Prince to ruin his ministers and
favourites by halves; and tho' the unhappy prisoner wrote once in so moving
a strain as even to draw tears from his eyes, he hardened himself against
all move∣ments of pity, and refused his pardon. The conclusion of Cromwel's
letter ran in these words. 
<Q REND="inline">"I a most woful prisoner, am ready to
submit to death when it shall please God and your majesty; and yet the
frail flesh incites me to call to your grace for mercy and pardon of mine
offences. Written at the Tower with the heavy heart and trembling hand of your
highness's most miserable prisoner and poor slave, Thomas Cromwel.
And a little below, Most gracious Prince, I cry for mercy, mercy,
mercy."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. i. p. 281, 282.</NOTE></Q> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">28th July.</NOTE> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">His execution.</NOTE> When brought to
exe∣cution, he avoided all earnest protestations of his innocence, and all
complaints against the sentence pronounced upon him. He knew that Henry
would resent on his son these symptoms of opposition to his will, and
that his death alone would not terminate that monarch's vengeance. He was a man
of prudence, industry, and ability; worthy of a better master and of a
better fate. Tho' raised to the summit of power from a very low origin, he
betrayed no insolence or contempt of his inferiors; and was careful to
remember all the obligations, which, during his lower fortune, he had owed to
any one. He had served as a private sentinel in the Italian wars, where he
received some good office from a Lucquese merchant, who had entirely forgot
his person, as well as the service, which he had rendered him. Cromwel, in
his grandeur, happened, at London, to cast his eye on his benefactor, now
reduced to poverty, by misfortunes. He immediately sent for him, put him in
mind of their antient friendship, and by his grateful as∣sistance,
re-instated him in his former prosperous circumstances<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. i. p. 172</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">King's di∣vorce from Anne of Cleves.</NOTE>
THE measures for divorcing the King from Anne of Cleves, were carried on at
the same time with the bill of attainder against Cromwel. The house of
peers, in conjunction with the commons, applied to him by petition, desiring
that he would allow his marriage to be examined; and orders were immediately
given to lay the matter before the convocation. Anne had been formerly
con∣tracted by her father to the Duke of Lorrain; but she, as well as the
Duke, were at that time under age, and the contract had been afterwards
annulled by the consent of both parties. The King, however, pleaded this
contract as a ground of divorce; and he added two reasons more, which may
seem a little extraor∣dinary; that, when he espoused Anne, he had not
inwardly given his consent, <PB N="241" REF="246"/> and that he had not
consummated the marriage. The convocation were satisfied with these
reasons, and solemnly annulled the marriage between the King and Queen: The
Parliament ratified the decision of the clergy<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">To show how much Henry sported with law and common sense;
how servilely the Parliament followed all his caprices; and how much both of
them were lost to all sentiment of shame; an act was passed this
session, declaring, that a precontract should be no ground of annulling
a marriage; as if that pretext had not been made use of both in the case of
Anne Boleyn and Anne of Cleves. But the King's intention in this law is said
to be a design of restoring the princess Elizabeth to her right of
le∣gitimacy; and it was his character never to look farther than the present
object, without regarding the inconsistency of his conduct. The Parliament
made it high treason to deny the dissolution of Henry's marriage with
Anne of Cleves. Herbert.</NOTE>; and the sentence was soon after notified
to that princess.</P>
<P>ANNE was blest with a happy insensibility of temper, even
in the points which the most nearly affect her sex; and the King's
aversion towards her, as well as his prosecution of the divorce, had never
given her the least uneasiness. She willingly hearkened to terms of
composition with him; and when he offered to adopt her as his sister, to
give her place next the Queen, and his own daughter, and to make a settlement
of three thousand pounds a year upon her; she accept∣ed the conditions, and
gave her consent to the divorce<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Herbert, p. 458,
459.</NOTE>. She even wrote to her brother, (for her father was dead) that
she had been very well used in England, and desired him to live on good
terms with the King. The only instance of pride which she betrayed was,
that she refused to return into her own country after the affront which
she had received; and she lived and died in England.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING Anne's moderation, this incident produced a
great cold∣ness between the King and the German princes; but as the
situation of Europe was now much altered, Henry was the more indifferent to
their resentment. The close intimacy which had taken place between Francis
and Charles, had subsisted during a very short time: The
dissimilarity of their characters soon renewed, with greater violence
than ever, their former jealousy and hatred. While Charles re∣mained at
Paris, Francis had been imprudently engaged, by his open temper, and by that
satisfaction which a noble mind naturally feels in performing generous
actions, to make some very dangerous confidences to that interested
monarch; and having now lost all suspicion of his rival, he hoped, that
the emperor and he, supporting each other, might neglect every other
alliance. He not only communicated to his guest the state of his
negociations with Sultan Solyman and the Venetians: He also laid open the
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ollicitations which he had
received from <PB N="242" REF="247"/> the court of England, to enter into a
confederacy against him<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pere Daniel, Du
Tillet.</NOTE>. Charles had no sooner reached his own dominions, than he
shewed himself unworthy of the friendly reception which he had met with. He
flatly refused to execute his pro∣mise, and put the duke of Orleans in
possession of the Milanese: He informed So∣lyman, and the senate of
Venice, of the treatment which they had received from their ally: And he took
care that Henry should not be ignorant how willingly Francis had abandoned
his ancient friend, to whom he owed such important ob∣ligations, and had
sacrificed him to a new confederate: He even poisoned and
misrepresented many things, which the unsuspecting heart of the French
mo∣narch had disclosed to him. Had Henry possessed true judgment
and generosity, this incident alone had been sufficient to guide him in the
choice of his allies. But his domineering pride carried him immediately to
renounce the friendship of Francis, who had so unexpectedly given the
emperor the preference: And as Charles invited him to a renewal of ancient
amity, he willingly accepted the offer; and thinking himself secure in this
alliance, he neglected the friendship both of France and of the German
princes.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">8th August.</NOTE> THE new turn which Henry
had taken with regard to foreign affairs, was ex∣tremely agreeable to his
catholic subjects; and as it had perhaps contributed, among other reasons,
to the ruin of Cromwel, it made them entertain hopes of a final prevalence over
their antagonists. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">His marriage with Cathe∣rine Howard.</NOTE>
The marriage of the King with Catherine Howard, which followed soon after his
divorce from Anne of Cleves, was also regarded as a very favourable incident
to their cause; and the subse∣quent events corresponded perfectly to
their expectations. The King's councils being now directed by Norfolk and
Gardiner, a surious persecution commenced against the protestants; and
the law of the six articles was executed with rigour. Dr. Barnes, who had
been the cause of Lambert's execution, felt, in his turn, the severity of
the persecuting spirit; and, by a bill which passed in parliament,
without trial, he was condemned to the flames, together with Jerome and
Ger∣rard. He discussed theological questions even at the stake; and
as the debate be∣tween him and the sheriff, turned upon the invocation of
saints, he said, that he doubted whether the saints could pray for us;
but if they could, he hoped in half an hour, to be praying for the sheriff
and all the spectators. He next en∣treated the sheriff to carry to the King
his dying requests, which he fondly ima∣gined would have authority with that
monarch, who had sent him to the stake▪ The purport of his requests
was, that Henry, besides repressing superstitious ce∣remonies,
should be extremely vigilant in preventing fornication and common
swearing<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. I. p. 298.
Fox.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="243" REF="248"/> WHILE Henry was exerting this violence
against the protestants, he spared not the catholics who denied his
supremacy; and a foreigner, who was at that time in England, had reason to
say, that those who were against the pope were burned, and those who
were for him were hanged<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, vol. II. p. 5<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>9.</NOTE>. The King even displayed, in an oftentatious manner,
this tyrannical equity and impartiality, which reduced both parties to
subjection, and infused terror into every breast. Barnes, Gerrard, and
Jerome had been carried to the place of execution on three hurdles; and along
with them there was placed on each hurdle a catholic, who was also exe∣cuted
for his religion. These catholics were Abel, Fetherstone, and Powel, who
declared, that the most grievous part of their punishment was the being
coupled to such heretical miscreants as suffered with them<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Saunders de schism. Angl.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THO' the spirit of the English seemed to be totally sunk
under the despotic power of Henry, there appeared some symptoms of
discontent: An incon∣siderable insurrection broke out in Yorkshire,
headed by Sir John Nevil; but it was soon suppressed, and Nevil, with
the other ringleaders, was executed. The rebels were supposed to have been
instigated by the intrigues of cardinal Pole; and the King was instantly
determined to make the countess of Salisbury suffer for her son's
offences. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">27 May.</NOTE> He ordered her to be carried to
the place of execution, and this venerable matron maintained still, in

trial. She told the executioner, that, if he would have her head, he must win
it the best way he could: And thus shaking her venerable grey locks, she
ran about the scaffold; and the executioner followed her with his ax, aiming
many fruitless blows at her neck, before he was able to give her the fatal
stroke. Thus perished the last of the line of Plantagenet, which, with
great glory, but still greater crimes and misfortunes, had governed England
for the space of three hundred years. The lord Leonard Grey, a man who had
formerly rendered great service to the crown, was also beheaded for
treason, soon after the countess of Salisbury. We know little of the
grounds of his prosecution.</P>
<P>THE insurrection in the North engaged Henry to make a
progress thither, in order to quiet the minds of his people, to reconcile
them to his government, and to abolish the ancient superstitions, to
which those parts were much addicted. He had also another motive for this
journey: <MILESTONE N="1541" UNIT="year"/> He proposed to hold a conference
at York with his nephew the King of Scotland, and, if possible, to cement a
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lose and indissoluble union
with that kingdom.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">State of affairs in Scotland.</NOTE> THE
same spirit of religious innovation, which had seized the other parts of
Europe, had made its way into Scotland, and had begun, long before this period,
to exci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> the same jealousies,
fears, and persecutions. About the year 1527, Patrick Hamilton, a young man
of a noble family, having been created abbot of Ferne, was sent abroad for
his education; but had fallen into company with some reformers, and he
returned into his own country very ill disposed to∣wards that church, of
which his birth and his merit entitled him to attain the highest honours. The
fervour of youth, and his zeal for novelty, made it impossible for him to
conceal his sentiments; and Campbel, prior of the Domi∣nicans, who, under
colour of friendship, and a sympathy in opinion, had insi∣nuated
himself into his confidence, delated him to Beaton, archbishop of St.
An∣drews. Hamilton was invited to St. Andrews, in order to maintain, with
some of the clergy, a dispute concerning the controverted points; and after
much rea∣soning with regard to justification, freewill, original
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>in, and other topics of that
nature, the conference ended with their condemning Hamilton to be burnt for his
errors. The young man, who had been deaf to the insinuations of ambition, was
less likely to be shaken with the fears of death, while he proposed to
himself both the glory of bearing testimony to the truth, and the immediate
reward at∣tending his martyrdom. The people, who compassionated his youth,
his virtue, and his noble birth, were much moved with the constancy of his
end; and the event still more confirmed them in their favourable sentiments
towards him. He cited Campbel, who still insulted him at the stake, to
answer before the judg∣ment-seat of Christ; and as that persecutor,
either astonished with these events, or overcome with remorse, or,
perhaps, seized with a distemper, soon after lost his senses, and
fell into a fever, of which he died; the people regarded Hamil∣ton as a
prophet, as well as a martyr<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Spotswood's
Hist, church of Scotland, p. 62.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>AMONG the disciples converted by Hamilton, was one friar
Forrest, who became a zealous preacher; and who, tho' he did not openly
discover his sentiments, was suspected to lean towards the new
opinions. His diocesan, the bishop of Dunkel, enjoined him, when he met
with a good epistle or good gospel, which favoured the liberties of holy
church, to preach on it, and let the rest alone. Forrest an∣swered, that
he had read both old and new restament, and had not found an ill epistle,
or ill gospel in any part of them. The extreme attachment to the
scrip∣tures was regarded in those days as a sure characteristic of
here<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y; and Forrest was soon
after brought to his trial, and condemned to the flames. While the priests
were deliberating on the place of his execution, a bystander advised them
to burn <PB N="245" REF="250"/> him in
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> cellar: For that the smoke
of Mr. Patrick Hamilton had infect∣ed all those on whom it blew<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Spotswood, p. 65.</NOTE></P>
<P>THE clergy were at that time reduced to great difficulties, not
only in Scot∣land, but all over Europe. As the reformers aimed at a total
subversion of anci∣ent establishments, which they represented as
idolatrous, impious, detestable, the priests, who found both their honours
and properties at stake, thought that they had a right to resist, by
every extremity, these dangerous invaders, and that the same simple
principles of equity, which justified a man in killing a pyrate or a robber,
would acquit them for the execution of such heretics. A toleration, tho' it
is never acceptable to ecclefiastics, might, they said, be admitted in
other cases; but seemed an absurdity where fundamentals were shaken,
and where the possessions, and even the subsistence of the
established clergy were brought in danger. But tho' the church was thus
carried by policy, as well as inclination, to kindle the fires of
persecution, they found the success of this remedy very precarious, and
observed, that the enthusiastic zeal of the reformers, inflamed by
punish∣ment, was apt to prove very contagious on the compassionate minds
of the spectators. The new doctrine, amidst all the dangers to which it was
exposed, spread itself secretly every where; and the minds of men were
gradually dis∣posed to a revolution in religion.</P>
<P>BUT the most dangerous symptom for the clergy in Scotland
was, that the no∣bility, moved by the example of England, had cast a
wistful eye on the church revenues, and hoped, if a reformation took place,
to enrich themselves by the plunder of the ecclesiastics. James
himself, who was very poor, and was somewhat inclined to magnificence,
particularly in building, had been swayed by like motives; and began to
threaten the clergy with the same fate which at∣tended them in the
neighbouring country. Henry also, never ceased exhorting his nephew to
imitate his example; and being moved both by the pride of mak∣ing proselytes,
and the prospect of security, if Scotland should embrace a close union
with him, he sollicited the King of Scots to meet him at York; and he
obtained a promise to that purpose.</P>
<P>THE ecclesiastics were extremely alarmed with this
resolution of James; and they employed every expedient, in order to prevent
it. They represented the dangers of innovation; the pernicious consequences
of aggrandizing the nobility, already too powerful; the hazard of putting
himself into the hands of the English, his hereditary enemies; the
dependance which must ensue upon losing the friend∣ship of France, and
all foreign potentates. To these considerations, they added the prospect
of present interest, by which they found the King to be much go∣verned: 
<PB N="246" REF="251"/> They offered him a present gratuity of fifty
thousand pounds Scots: They promised him, that the church should always
be ready to contribute to his supply: And they pointed out to him, the
confiscations of heretics, as the means of filling his exchequer, and of
adding a hundred thousand pounds a year to the crown revenues<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Buchanan, lib. XIV. Drummond in Ja. 5. Pitscoti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, ibid. Knox.</NOTE>. The
insinuations of his new Queen, to whom youth, beauty, and address had given
a powerful influence over him, seconded all these reasons; and James was
at last engag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d, first to delay
his journey, then to send excuses to the King of England, who had already
come to York, in order to be present at the conference.</P>
<P>HENRY, vexed with the disappointment, and enraged at the
affront, vowed vengeance against his nephew; and he began, by permitting
pyracies at sea, and incursions at land, to put his threats in execution.
But he received soon after, in his own family, an affront to which he was
much more sensible, and which touch∣ed him in a point where he had always
shewn an extreme delicacy. He had thought himself very happy in his new
marriage: The youth, beauty, and agreeable disposition of Catherine, had
entirely captivated his affections; and he made no secret of his devoted
attachment to her. He had even put up a prayer in his chappel, returning thanks
to heaven for the felicity which the conjugal state afforded him; and he
desired the bishop of Lincoln to compose a form of thanks∣giving for
that purpose. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Discovery of the Queen's crimes.</NOTE> But
the Queen very little merited this tenderness which he bore her: She had
abandoned herself to lewdness. One Lascelles brought in∣telligence of her
dissolute life to Cranmer, and told him, that his sister, formerly a
servant in the old dutchess of Norfolk's family, with whom Catherine was
edu∣cated, had given him a particular a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>count of all her disorders. Derham and Mannoc, both of them
servants of the dutchess, had been admitted to her bed; and she had even
taken little care to conceal her shame from the other servants of the
family. The primate, struck with this intelligence, which it was equally
dangerous to conceal or to discover, communicated the matter to the earl of
Hert∣ford and to the chancellor. They agreed, that the matter should by no
means be buried in silence; and the archbishop himself seemed the
most proper person to disclose it to the King. Cranmer, unwilling to
speak on so delicate a subject, wrote a narrative of the whole, and
conveyed it to Henry, who was infinitely astonished at the intelligence. So
confident was he of the fidelity of his consort, that he gave at first no
credit to the information; and he said to the lord privy∣seal, to lord
Russel, high admiral, Sir Anthony Brown, and Wriothesley, that he
regarded the whole as a forgery. Cranmer was now in a very perilous
situa∣tion; and had not full proofs been found, certain and inevitable
destruction hung <PB N="247" REF="252"/> over him. The King's impatience,
however, and jealousy prompted him to search the matter to the bottom: The
privy-seal was ordered to examine Las∣celles, who persisted in the
information he had given; and still appealed to his sister's testimony.
That nobleman made next a pretence of hunting, and went to Sussex, where
the woman at that time resided: He found her both constant in her former
intelligence, and particular as to the facts; and the whole bore but too much
the face of probability. Mannoc and Derham, who were arrested at the same
time, and examined by the chancellor, made the Queen's guilt entirely certain
by their confession; and discovered other particulars, which redounded
still more to her dishonour. Three ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ds of the family were admitted into her secrets; and some of
them had even past the night in bed with her and her lovers. All the
examinations were laid before the King, who was so deeply affected, that he
remained a long time speechless, and at last burst into tears. The
Queen be∣ing now questioned, denied her guilt; but when informed, that a full
discovery was made, she confessed, that she had been criminal before
her marriage; and only insisted, that she had never been false to the
King's bed. But as there was evidence, that one Colepeper had passed the
night with her alone since her mar∣riage; and as it appeared, that she had
taken Derham, her old paramour, into her service; she seemed to deserve
very little credit in this asseveration; and the King besides, was not of
a disposition to make any difference between these de∣grees of guilt.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1542" UNIT="year"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">16 January.</NOTE> HENRY found, that he could
not so fully or expeditiously satiate his vengeance on all these
criminals as by assembling a Parliament, the usual instrument of his
tyranny. The two houses, having received the Queen's confession, began by
an address to the King; which consisted of several particulars. They
entreated him not to be vexed with this untoward accident, to which all men
were subject; but to consider the frailty of human nature, and the
mutability of human affairs; and from these views to derive a subject of
consolation. They desired leave to frame a bill of attainder against the
Queen and her accomplices; and they begg∣ed him to give his assent to this
bill, not in person, which would renew his vexa∣tion, and might endanger his
health, but by commissioners appointed for that purpose. And as there was
a law in force, making it treason to speak ill of the Queen, as well as
King, they craved his royal pardon, if any of them should, on the present
occasion, have transgressed any part of that statute.</P>
<P>HAVING obtained a gracious answer to these requests, the
Parliament proceeded to an act of attainder for treason against the Queen,
and the viscountess of Rocheford, who had conducted her secret amours;
and in this act Colepeper, <PB N="248" REF="253"/> and Derham, were also
comprized. At the same time, they passed a bill of attainder for
misprision of treason against the old dutchess of Norfolk,
Ca∣therine's grandmother, her uncle, lord William Howard, and his lady,
toge∣ther with the countess of Bridgewater, and nine persons more;
because they knew the Queen's vicious life before her marriage, and yet
concealed it. This was an effect of Henry's usual extravagance, to expect
that parents should so far forget the ties of natural affection, and the
sentiments of shame and decency, as to reveal to him the most secret
disorders of their family. He himself seems to have been sensible of
the cruelty of this sentence: For he pardoned the dutchess of Norfolk, and
most of the others, condemned for misprision of treason.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, to secure himself for the future, as well as his
successors, from this fatal accident, he engaged the Parliament to frame
a law, equally full of extra∣vagance. It was enacted, that any one, who knew,
or vehemently presumed any guilt in the Queen, and did not, within twenty
days, disclose it to the King or council, should be guilty of treason;
prohibiting every one, at the same time, from spreading the matter abroad,
or even privately whispering it to others. It was also enacted, that if the
King married any woman, who had been incontinent, taking her for a true maid,
she should be guilty of treason, in case she did not previously
reveal her guilt to him. The people made merry with this extra∣ordinary
clause, and said, that the King must henceforth look out for a widow; for
no reputed maid would ever be perswaded to incur the penalty of the
statute<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. I. p. 314.</NOTE>. After all
these laws were passed, the Queen was beheaded on Tower-hill, toge∣ther
with the lady Rocheford. They behaved in a manner suitable to their
dis∣solute life; and as the lady Rocheford was known to be the chief
instrument, who had brought Anne Boleyn to her end, she died unpitied; and
men were farther confirmed, by the discovery of this woman's guilt, in the
favourable sen∣timents which they had entertained of that unfortunate
Queen.</P>
<P>THE King made no demand of any subsidies from this
Parliament; but he found means of enriching his exchequer from another quarter:
He took far∣ther steps towards the dissolution of colleges, hospitals,
and other foundations of that nature. The courtiers had been practising on
the presidents and governors, to make a surrender of their revenues to the
King; and they had been successful with eight of them. But there was an
obstacle to their farther progress: It had been provided, by the local
statutes of most of these foundations, that no presi∣dent, nor any
fellows, could make such a deed without the unanimous vote of all the
fellows; and this consent was not easily obtained. All such statutes
were now annulled by Parliament; and the revenues of these houses, so
useful to the <PB N="249" REF="254"/> <MILESTONE N="1541" UNIT="year"/>
public, were now laid open to the rapacity of the King and his favourites<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It was enacted by this Parliament, that there should be
trial of treason in any country where the King should appoint by
commission. The statutes of treason had been extremely multiplied in
this reign; and such an expedient saved trouble and charges in trying that
crime. The same Parliament erected Ireland into a kingdom; and Henry
henceforth annexed the title of King of Ireland to his other titles. This
session, the commons first began the practice of freeing any of their
members, who were arrested, by a writ issued by the speaker. Formerly
it was usual for them to apply for a writ from chancery to that purpose.
This precedent encreased the authority of the commons, and had after∣wards
considerable consequences. Hollingsh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, p. 955▪ 956. Baker, p. 289.</NOTE>. The church
had been so long their prey, that nobody was surprized at any new inroads
made upon it. From the regular, Henry now proceeded to make de∣vastations on
the secular clergy. He extorted from many of the bishops a sur∣render of
chapter lands; and by this devise he pillaged the sees of Canterbury, York,
and London, and enriched his greedy parasites and flatterers with their
spoils.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ecclesiastical affairs.</NOTE> THE clergy
have been commonly so fortunate as to make a concern for their temporal
interests go hand in hand with a jealousy for orthodoxy; and both these
passions be regarded, by the people, ignorant and superstitious, as a
zeal for religion: But the violent and headstrong character of Henry now
disjoined these objects. His rapacity was gratified by plundering the church;
his bi∣gotry and arrogance by persecuting heretics. Tho' he engaged the
Parliament to mitigate the penalties of the six articles, so far as regards
the marriage of priests, which was now only subjected to a forfeiture of
goods, chattles, and lands during life; he was still equally bent on
maintaining a rigid purity in speculative principles. He had appointed a
commission, consisting of the two archbishops and several bishops
of both provinces, together with a considerable number of doctors of
divinity; and by virtue of his ecclesiastical supremacy he had given them
in charge to choose a religion for his people. Before the com∣missioners
had made any progress in this arduous undertaking, the Parliament, in 1541,
had passed a law, by which they ratified all the tenets, which these
di∣vines should establish with the King's consent: And they were not
ashamed of expressly declaring that they took their religion upon trust,
and had no other rule, in religious as well as temporal concerns, than the
arbitrary will of their master. There is only one clause of the statute,
which may seem to savour some∣what of the spirit of liberty: It was
enacted, that the ecclesiastical commissioners should establish
nothing repugnant to the laws and statutes of the realm. But in reality this
proviso was inserted by the King, to serve his own purposes. By
introducing a confusion and contradiction into the laws, he became more the 
<PB N="250" REF="255"/> master of every one's life and property. And as the
antient independance of the church still gave him jealousy, he was well
pleased, under cover of such a clause, to introduce appeals from the
spiritual to the civil courts. It was for a like reason, he would never
promulgate a body of canon law▪ and encouraged the judges on all
occasions to interpose in ecclesiastical causes wherever they thought
the law or royal prerogative concerned. A happy innovation; tho' at first
invented for arbitrary purposes!</P>
<P>THE King, armed by the authority of Parliament, or rather by
their acknow∣legement of that spiritual supremacy, which he believed
inherent in him, em∣ployed his commissioners to select a system of
tenets for the assent and belief of the nation. A small volume was soon
after published, called, the <HI>Institution of a Christian Man,</HI>
which was received by the convocation, and voted to be the in∣fallible
standard of orthodoxy. All the delicate points of justification, faith,
free∣will, good works, and grace, are there defined, with a leaning towards the
opi∣nion of the reformers: The sacraments, which a few years before were only
al∣lowed to be three, are now encreased to the number of seven, conformable
to the sentiments of the catholics. The King's caprice is discernible thro'
the whole; and the book is in reality to be regarded as his composition. For
Henry, while he made his opinion a rule for the nation, would tye his own hands
by no canon or authority, not even by any which he himself had formerly
established.</P>
<P>THE people had occasion soon after to see a farther
instance of the King's in∣constancy. He was not long satisfied with his
Institution of a Christian Man: He ordered a new book to be composed,
called, the <HI>Erudition of a Christian Man;</HI> and without asking the
assent of the convocation, he published, by his own au∣thority, and that
of the Parliament, this new model of orthodoxy. It differs from the
institution<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Collier, vol. ii. p. 190.</NOTE>; but the
King was no less positive in his new creed than he had been in the old; and
he required the belief of the nation to veer about at his signal. In both
these books, he was particularly careful to inculcate the doctrine of
passive obedience; and he was no less careful to retain the nation in the
practice.</P>
<P>WHILE the King was spreading his own books among the people,
he seems to have been extremely perplexed, as well as the clergy, what
course to take with the scriptures. A review had been made by the
ecclesiastical synod of the new translation of the Bible; and Gardiner
had proposed, that, instead of em∣ploying English expressions
throughout, several Latin words should still be pre∣served, because
they contained, as he pretended, such peculiar energy and signi∣ficance,
that they had no correspondent terms in the vulgar tongue<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. i. p. 315.</NOTE>. Among these were <HI>eclesia,
paenitentia, pontifex, contritus, holocausta, sacramentum, elementa,</HI> 
<PB N="251" REF="256"/> <HI>ceremonia, musterium, presbyter, sacrificium,
humilitas, satisfactio, peccatum, gratia, hostia, charitas,</HI> &amp;c.
But as this mixture would have appeared extremely bar∣barous, and was plainly
calculated for no other purpose than to retain the people in their antient
ignorance, the proposal was rejected. The knowledge of the peo∣ple, however,
at least their disputative turn, seemed to be an inconvenience still
more dangerous; and the King and Parliament<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Which met on the 22d of January, 1543.</NOTE>, soon after the
publication of the scriptures, retracted the concession, which they had
formerly made; and prohibited all but gentlemen and merchants to peruse
them<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">33 Hen. VIII. c. 1.</NOTE>. Even that
liberty was not granted, without an apparent hesitation, and a dread of the
consequences: These persons were allowed to read, <HI>so it be done
quietly and with good order.</HI> And the preamble to the act sets forth, 
<Q REND="inline">"that many seditious and ignorant persons
had abused the liberty granted them for reading the Bible, and that great
diversity of opinions, animosities, tumults, and schisms had been
occasioned by perverting the sense of the scriptures."</Q> It seemed
very difficult to reconcile the King's model for uniformity, with the
permission of free enquiry.</P>
<P>THE mass book also passed under the King's cognizance;
and little alteration was as yet made in it: Some doubtful or fictitious
saints only were struck out; and the name of the pope was erazed. This
latter precaution was likewise used with regard to every new book, that was
printed, or even old book that was sold. The word, Pope, was carefully
omitted or blotted out<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Parliamentary History,
vol. iii. p. 113.</NOTE>; as if that precaution could abolish the term from
the language, or as if such a persecution of it did not rather imprint it
more strongly in the memory of the people.</P>
<P>THE King took care about this time to clear the churches of
another abuse, which had crept into them. Plays, interludes, and farces were
there often acted in derision of the former superstitions; and the
reverence of the multitude for their antient principles and modes of worship,
was thereby gradually effaced<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. i. p.
318.</NOTE>. We do not hear, that the catholics attempted to retaliate by
employing this powerful engine against their adversaries, or endeavoured by
like arts to expose that fana∣tical spirit, by which, it appears, the
reformers were often actuated. Perhaps the people were not disposed to
relish a jest on that side: Perhaps the greater simplicity and the more
spiritual abstract worship of the protestants, gave less hold to
ridicule, which is commonly founded on sensible representations. It was,
therefore, a very agreeable concession, which Henry made the catholic
party, to suppress entirely these religious comedies.</P>
<P>THUS Henry laboured incessantly, by arguments, creeds, and
penal statutes, to bring his subjects to an uniformity in their religious
sentiments: But as he en∣tered, <PB N="252" REF="257"/> himself, with the
greatest earnestness, into all these scholastic reasonings, he
encouraged the people, by his example, to apply themselves to the study of
theology; and it was in vain afterwards to expect, however present fear might
re∣strain their tongues or pens, that they would cordially agree in any set
of tenets or opinions prescribed to them.</P>

<P><MILESTONE N="1542" UNIT="year"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">War with Scotland.</NOTE> HENRY, being
determined to avenge himself of the King of Scots for flighting the advances,
which he made for his friendship, would gladly have ob∣tained a supply from
the Parliament, to enable him to prosecute that enterprize; but as he did not
think it prudent to discover his intentions, the Parliament, con∣formable to
their frugal maxims, would understand no hints; and the King was
disappointed in his expectations. He continued, however, to make preparations
for war; and so soon as he thought himself in a condition to invade
Scotland, he published a manifesto, by which he endeavoured to justify
his hostilities. He complained of James's disappointing him in the
promised interview; which was the real ground of the quarrel<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Buchanan, lib. 14. Drummond in James the fifth.</NOTE>: But
in order to give a more specious co∣louring to the enterprize, he mentioned
other injuries; that his nephew had given protection to some English rebels
and fugitives, and had detained some territory, which, Henry pretended,
belonged to England. He even revived the old claim of the dependance of the
crown of Scotland, and he summoned James to do ho∣mage to him as his liege
lord and superior. He employed the duke of Norfolk, whom he called the
scourage of the Scots, to command in the war; and tho' James sent the
bishop of Aberdeen, and Sir James Learmont of Darsay, to ap∣pease his
uncle, he would hearken to no terms of accommodation. While Nor∣folk was
assembling his army at Newcastle, Sir Robert Bowes, attended with 
<PB N="253" REF="258"/> Sir Ralph Sadler, Sir Ralph Evers, Sir Brian Latoun, and
others, made an in∣cursion into Scotland, and advanced towards Jedburgh, with
an intention of pil∣laging and destroying that town. The earl of Angus, and
George Douglas, his brother, who had been so many years banished their
country, and had subsisted by Henry's bounty, joined the English army
in this incursion; and the forces, commanded by Bowes, exceeded four
thousand men. James had not been ne∣gligent in his preparations for defence,
and had posted a considerable body, un∣der the command of the earl of
Huntley, for the protection of the borders. Lord Hume, at the head of his
clients, was hastening to join Huntley, when he met with the English army;
and a battle immediately ensued. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">24th August.</NOTE> While they were engaged,
the forces under Huntley began to appear; and the English, afraid of being
overpowered and surrounded, took to flight, and were pursued by the enemy.
Evers, Latoun, and some other persons of distinction, were taken
pri∣soners. A few only of small note fell in this skirmish<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Buchanan, lib. 14.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE duke of Norfolk, mean while, began to move from his camp at
New∣castle; and being attended by the earls of Shrewsbury, Derby,
Cumberland, Surrey, Hertford, Rutland, with many others of the nobility, he
advanced to the borders. His army amounted to above twenty thousand men; and
it re∣quired the utmost efforts of Scotland to resist such formidable
preparations. James had assembled his whole military force at Fala and
Sautrey, and was ready to advance so soon as he should be informed of
Norfolk's invading his kingdom. The English passed the Tweed at Berwic,
and advanced along the banks of the river as far as Kelso; but hearing that
James had gathered together near thirty thousand men, they repassed the
river at that village, and retreated into their own country<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Buchanan, lib. 14.</NOTE>. The King of Scots, inflamed with a
desire of military glory, and of revenge on his invaders, gave the signal
for pursuing them, and carrying the war into England. He was surprized to
find, that his nobility, who were generally disaffected on account of the
preference, which he had given the clergy, opposed this resolution, and
refused to attend him in his projected enterprize. Enraged at this defection,
he reproached them with cowardice, and threatened vengeance; but still
resolved, with the forces which adhered to him, to make an impression on
the enemy's country. He sent ten thousand men to the western borders, who
entered England at Solway firth; and he himself followed them at a small
distance, ready to join them upon occasion. Disgusted, however, with
the refractory disposition of his nobles, he sent a messenger to the
army, depriv∣ing lord Maxwel, their general, of his commission, and
conferring the com∣mand on Oliver Sinclair, a private gentleman, who was his
favourite. The <PB N="254" REF="259"/> army were extremely displeased with
this alteration, and were ready to disband;

of Dacres and Musgrave. A panic seized the Scotch, who immediately took to
flight, and were pursued by the enemy. Few were killed in this rout; for it
was no action; but a great many were taken prisoners, and some of the
prin∣cipal nobility. Among these were the earls of Cassilis and
Glencairn; the lords Maxwel, Fleming, Sommerville, Oliphant, Grey, who were all
sent to London, and given in custody to different noblemen.</P>
<P>THE King of Scots, hearing of this disaster, was confounded
to the last de∣gree; and being naturally of a melancholy disposition, as
well as endowed with a high spirit, he lost all command of his temper on
this dismal occasion. Rage against his nobility, who, he believed, had
betrayed him; shame for a defeat by such unequal numbers; regret of the
past, fear of the future; all these pas∣sions so wrought upon him,
that he would admit of no consolation, but aban∣doned himself wholly to
despair. His body was wasted by sympathy with his anxious mind; and even
his life began to be thought in danger. He had no child living; and hearing
that his Queen was safely delivered, he asked whether she had brought him
a male or female? Being told, the latter; he turned about in his bed: 
<Q REND="inline">"The crown came with a woman," said he, "and
it will go with one: Many miseries await this poor kingdom: Henry will make
it his own either by force of arms or by marriage."</Q> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">14th of De∣cember.</NOTE> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Death of James the fifth.</NOTE>A few days
after, he expired, in the flower of his age; a prince of considerable virtues
and talents, well fitted, by his vigilance and personal courage, for
repressing those disorders, to which his king∣dom, during that age, was
so much exposed. He executed justice with the greatest impartiality and
rigour; but as he supported the commonalty and the church against the
rapine of the nobility, he escaped not the hatred of that order. The
protestants also, whom he repressed, have endeavoured to throw many
stains on his memory; but have not been able to fix any considerable
imputation on him<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The persecutions, exercised
during James's reign, are not to be ascribed to his bigotry, a vice of which
he seems to have been as free as Francis the first or the emperor Charles,
both of whom, as well as James, shewed, in different periods of their lives,
even an inclination to the new doctrines. The extremities to which all these
princes were carried, proceeded entirely from the situation of affairs,
during that age, which rendered it impossible for them to act with greater
temper or moderation, after they had embraced the resolution of supporting
the antient establishments. So violent was the propensity of the times
towards innovation, that a toleration of the new preachers was equivalent to a
formed design of changing the national religion. And even the greatest
friends to liberty of conscience have admitted, that tho' a sect, which has
already diffused itself, has a just claim to indulgence, yet may it often
be consistent with equity as well as found policy, to repress by
severity the first beginnings of schism and new systems of
theology.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="255" REF="260"/> <MILESTONE N="1543" UNIT="year"/> HENRY
was no sooner informed of his victory and of the death of his ne∣phew, than
he projected, as James had foreseen, the scheme of uniting Scotland to his
own dominions, by marrying his son, Edward, to the heiress of that
king∣dom<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Stowe, p. 584. Herbert, Burnet,
Buchanan.</NOTE>. He called together the Scotch nobles, who were his
prisoners; and af∣ter reproaching them, in severe terms, for their breach
of treaty, as he pretended, he began to soften his tone, and proposed to
them this expedient, by which, he hoped, those disorders, so prejudicial
to both states, would for the future be pre∣vented. He offered to bestow on
them their liberty without ransom; and only required of them engagements to
favour the marriage of the Prince of Wales with their young mistress. They
were easily prevailed on to give their assent to a proposal, which
seemed so natural, and so advantageous to both kingdoms; and being
conducted to Newcastle, they delivered to the duke of Norfolk, hosta∣ges
for their return, in case the intended nuptials were not compleated: And they
thence proceeded to Scotland, where they found affairs in some
confusion.</P>
<P>THE pope, finding his authority in Scotland exposed to danger
from the spread∣ing of the new opinions, had bestowed on Beaton, the
primate, the dignity of cardinal; and that prelate had been long regarded as
prime minister to James, and as the head of that party, which defended the
antient privileges and proper∣ties of the ecclesiastics. Upon the death of
his master, this man, apprehensive of the consequences both to his party
and himself, endeavoured to keep possession of the power; and for
that purpose, he is accused of executing a deed which re∣quired a high
degree of temerity. He forged, it is said, a will for the King, appointing
himself, and three noblemen, regents of the kingdom during the minority of
the infant Princess<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Sadler's Letters, p. 161.
Spotswood, p. 71. Buchanan, lib. 15.</NOTE>: At least, for historians are
not well agreed in the circumstances of the fact, he had read to James a
paper of that im∣port, to which that monarch, during the delirium which
preceded his death, had given an imperfect assent and approbation<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">John Knox, History of the reformation.</NOTE>. By
virtue of this will, Beaton had put himself in possession of the
government; and having joined his interests with those of the Queen
dowager, he obtained the consent of the convention of states, and excluded
the pretensions of the earl of Arran.</P>
<P>JAMES earl of Arran, of the name of Hamilton, was next heir to
the crown by his grandmother, daughter to James the third; and on that account
seemed best entitled to possess that high office, into which the
cardinal had intruded him∣self. The prospect also of his succession
after a Princess, who was in such tender infancy, procured him many
partizans; and tho' his character contained little spirit, activity, or
ambition, a propensity, which he had discovered for the new 
<PB N="256" REF="261"/> opinions, had attached to him all the
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> of these
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> By means of all these

Beaton's forgery, with the accession of the noblemen, who had been
prisoners in England, assisted too by some money, sent from London,
was able to turn the ballance in his favour. The earl of Angus, and his
brother, having taken the present opportunity of returning into their own
country, opposed the cardinal with all the force of that powerful family; and
the majority of the conven∣tion had now embraced opposite interests to
those which formerly prevailed. Arran was declared governor; the cardinal was
committed to custody under the care of lord Seton; and a negotiation was
commenced with Sir Ralph Sadler, the Eng∣lish ambassador, for the
marriage of the infant Queen with the Prince of Wales. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Treaty with Scotland.</NOTE> The following
conditions were quickly agreed on; that the Queen should remain in Scotland
till she was ten years of age; that she should then be sent to England
to be educated; that three Scotch nobles should immediately be delivered as
hos∣tages to Henry; and that the kingdom, notwithstanding its union with
Eng∣land, should still preserve its laws and privileges<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sir Ralph Sadler's Letters.</NOTE>. By means of these equitable
conditions, the war between the nations, which had threatened Scotland with
such dismal calamities, seemed to be fully composed, and to be changed
into perpetual concord and unanimity.</P>
<P>BUT the cardinal-primate, having prevailed on Seton to restore
him to his liberty, was able, by his intrigues, to confound all these
measures, which ap∣peared to be so well concerted. He assembled the
most considerable ecclesiastics; and having represented to them the
imminent danger, to which their revenues and privileges were exposed, he
perswaded them to collect privately from the clergy a large sum of money,
by which, if entrusted to his management, he promised to overturn the
schemes of their enemies<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Buchanan, lib.
15.</NOTE>. Besides the partizans, whom he acquired by pecuniary motives, he
rouzed up the zeal of those, who were attached to the catholic worship; and
he represented the union with Eng∣land as the sure forerunner of ruin to
the church and the antient religion. The national antipathy of the Scotch
against the English nation, was also an infallible engine, by which the
cardinal wrought upon the people; and tho' the terror of Henry's arms, and
their inability to make resistance, had procured a temporary assent to
the alliance and marriage proposed, the settled habits of the nation
pro∣duced an extreme aversion to those measures. The English
ambassador and his train received many insults from persons whom the
cardinal had incited to commit those indignities, in hopes of bringing on a
rupture. But Sadler very prudently dis∣sembled <PB N="257" REF="262"/> the
matter, and waited patiently till the day appointed for the delivery of the
hostages. He then demanded of the regent the performance of that im∣portant
article; but received for answer, that his authority was very precari∣ous,
that the nation had now taken a different impression, and that it was not
in his power to compel any of the nobility to deliver themselves as
hostages to the English. Sadler, foreseeing the consequence of this
refusal, sent a summons to all those who had been prisoners in
England, and required them to fulfil the pro∣mise which they had given of
returning into custody. None of them showed so much sentiment of
honour, as to perform their engagements, except Gilbert Kennedy, earl of
Cassilis. Henry was so well pleased with the behaviour of this
nobleman, that he not only received him graciously, but honoured him with
presents, gave him his liberty, and sent him back to Scotland, with his two
brothers, whom he had left as hostages<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Buchanan, lib.
XV.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">New rupture.</NOTE> THIS behaviour of the
Scotch nobles, tho' it reflected dishonour on the na∣tion, was not
unacceptable to the cardinal, who foresaw, that all these persons would
now be deeply interested to maintain their enmity and opposition to the
English. And as a war was soon expected with that kingdom, he found it
necessary immediately to apply to France, and to crave the assistance
of that ancient ally, during the present distresses of the Scotch
nation. Tho' Francis was fully sen∣sible of his interest in supporting
Scotland, a demand of aid could not have been made on him at a more
unseasonable juncture. His pretensions on the Milanese, and his
resentment against Charles, had engaged him in a war with that potentate;
and having made very great, tho' fruit'ess efforts during the preceding
campaign, he was the more disabled at present from defending his own
dominions, much more from granting any succour to the Scotch. Mathew Stuart,
earl of Lenox, a young nobleman of a great family, was at that time in the
French court; and Francis, being informed, that he was engaged in ancient and
hereditary enmity with the Hamiltons, who had murdered his father, sent him
over to his native country, as a support to the cardinal and the Queen
mother: And he promised, that a supply of money, and, if necessary,
even military succours, should soon be dispatched after him. Arran, the
governor, seeing all these preparations against him, assembled his
friends, and made an attempt to get the person of the infant Queen into his
custody; but being repulsed, he was obliged to come to an accommodation
with his enemies, and to entrust that precious charge to four neutral
persons, the heads of potent families, the Grahams, Areskines, Lindseys,
and Levistons. The arrival of Lenox, in the midst of these
trans∣actions, <PB N="258" REF="263"/> served to render the victory of the
French party over the English still more undisputable<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Buchanan, lib. XV. Drummond.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rupture with France.</NOTE> THE opposition
which Henry met with in Scotland from the French intrigues, excited his
resentment, and farther confirmed the resolution which he had before taken,
of breaking with France, and of uniting his arms with those of the emperor.
He had other grounds of complaint against the French King; which, tho' they
were not of great importance, yet being recent, were able to overballance
those great injuries which he had formerly received from Charles. He
pretended, that Francis had engaged to imitate his example in separating
himself entirely from the see of Rome, and that he had broke his promise
in that particular. He was dis∣satisfied, that James, his nephew, had been
allowed to marry, first Magdalene of France, then a princess of the house
of Guise; and he considered these alliances as pledges which Francis gave
of his intentions to support the Scotch against the power of England<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pere Daniel.</NOTE>. He had been informed of some railleries,
which the French King had thrown out against his conduct with regard to his
wives. He was dis∣gusted, that Francis, after so many obligations which
he owed him, had sacri∣ficed him to the emperor; and, in the confidence of
friendship, had rashly re∣vealed his secrets to that subtle and
interested monarch. And he complained, that regular payments were never made
of the sums due to him by France, and of the pension which had been
promised. Impelled by all these motives, he alienated himself from his
ancient friend and confederate, and formed a league with the emperor, who very
earnestly courted his alliance. This league, besides stipulations for
mutual defence, contained a plan for invading France; and the two monarchs
agreed to enter Francis's dominions with an army, each of twenty∣five
thousand men; and to require that prince to pay Henry all the sums which he
owed him, and to consign Boulogne, Montreuil, Terouenne, and Ardres, as a
security for the regular payment of his pension for the future: In case
these conditions were rejected, the confederate princes agreed, to challenge,
for Henry, the crown of France, and the dutchies of Normandy, Aquitaine, and
Guienne; for Charles, the dutchy of Burgundy, and some other territories<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Rymer, XIV. p. 768. XV. 2.</NOTE>. That they might
have a pretence for enforcing these claims, they sent a message to
Francis, requiring him to renounce his alliance with Sultan Solyman, and to
make repa∣ration for all the prejudice which Christendom had suffered from
that unnatural confederacy. Upon the French King's refusal, war was declared
against him by the confederates. It may be proper to observe, that the
partizans of France object∣ed to Charles his alliance with the heretical King
of England, as no less odious <PB N="259" REF="264"/> than that which Francis
had contracted with Solyman: And they observed, that this league was a breach
of that solemn promise which he had given to Cle∣ment the seventh, never
to make peace or alliance with England.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">22 January.</NOTE> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Parliament.</NOTE> WHILE the treaty with the
emperor was negociating, the King summoned a new session of Parliament,
in order to obtain supplies for his projected war with France. The Parliament
granted him a subsidy to be paid in three years: It was levied in a
peculiar manner; but exceeded not three shillings in the pound upon any
individual<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">They who were worth in goods twenty
shillings and upwards to five pounds, paid four pence of every pound; from
five pounds to ten pounds, eight pence; from ten pounds to twenty pounds,
six∣teen pence; from twenty and upwards, two shillings. Lands, fees, and
annuities, paid eight pence in the pound from twenty shillings to five
pounds; from five pounds to ten pounds, sixteen pence; from ten pounds to
twenty pounds, two shillings; from twenty pounds and upwards, three
shillings.</NOTE>. The convocation gave the King six shillings in the
pound, to be levied in three years. Greater sums were always, even during the
esta∣blishment of the catholic religion, exacted from the clergy than the
laity: Which made the emperor Charles say, when Henry dissolved the
monasteries, and sold their revenues, or bestowed them on his nobility
and courtiers, that he had killed the hen which brought him the golden
eggs<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Collier, vol. II. p. 176.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE Parliament also facilitated the execution of the former
law, by which the King's proclamations were made equal to statutes: They
appointed, that any nine counsellors should form a legal court for
punishing all disobedience to pro∣clamations. The total abolition of juries
in criminal causes, as well as of all Parliaments, seemed, if the King had
so pleased, the necessary consequence of this enormous law. He might
issue proclamations, for the execution of any penal statutes, and
afterwards try the criminals, not for breach of the law, but for disobedience
to his proclamation. It is remarkable, that the lord Mountjoy en∣tered a
protest against this statute; and it is equally remarkable, that that
pro∣test is the only one which was entered against any public bill during
this whole reign<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Burnet, p. 322.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WE have taken notice, in the end of the former chapter, of
some laws re∣garding religion, which the Parliament passed this
session, in order to gratify the King's humour. It was farther
enacted<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">34 &amp; 35 Hen. VIII. c. 1</NOTE>, that
every spiritual person, who preached or taught contrary to the doctrine
contained in the King's book, the <HI>Erudition of a christian man,</HI> or
contrary to any doctrine which he shall hence∣forth promulgate, was to be
admitted on the first conviction to renounce his errors; on the second, he
was required to carry a faggot; which if he refused to do, or fell into a
third offence, he was to be burnt. But the laity, for the third of∣fence, were
only to forfeit their goods and chattels, and to be liable to perpetual 
<PB N="260" REF="265"/> Imprisonment▪ Indictments must be laid within a
year after the offence, and the prisoner was allowed
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o bring witnesses for his
p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>gation. These penalties were
lighter than those formerly imposed on a denial of
transubstantiation▪ It was, however, subjoined in this statute,
that the act of the six articles was still in force. But in order to make
the King more entirely master of his people, it was en∣acted, that he might
hereafter, at his pleasure, change this act, or any provision in it. By
this clause, both parties were retained in subjection▪ so far as
regarded religion, the King was invested, in the fullest manner, with the
sole legislative autho∣rity in his kingdom; and all his subjects were,
under the severest penalties, ex∣pressly bound to receive implicitly,
whatever doctrine he should please to recom∣mend to them.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">12th July.</NOTE> THE reformers began to
entertain hopes, that this exorbitant power would be employed in their favour.
The King married Catherine Par, widow to Nevil lord Latimer; a woman of virtue,
and somewhat inclined to the new doctrine. By this marriage, Henry made good
what had formerly been foretold in jest, that he would be obliged to
espouse a widow. The King's league with the emperor, seemed to be a
circumstance no less favourable to the catholic party; and thus matters
remained still nearly ballanced between the factions.</P>
<P>THE advantages gained by this powerful confederacy between Henry
and Charles, were very inconsiderable, during the present year. The
campaign was opened with a victory, gained by the duke of Cleves, Francis's
ally, over the forces of the emperor<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Memoires du
Bellay, lib. X.</NOTE>: Francis, in person, took the field early; and made
himself master, without resistance, of the whole dutchy of Luxembourg:
He afterwards took Landrecy, and added some fortifications to it. Charles,
having at last assembled a powerful army, appeared in the Low Countries;
and after taking almost every fortress in the dutchy of Cleves, he reduced
the duke to sub∣mit to the terms which he was pleased to prescribe to
him. Being then joined by a body of six thousand English, he sat down
before Landrecy, and covered the siege with an army of above forty thousand
men. Francis advanced at the head of an army not much inferior; as if he
intended to give the emperor battle, or oblige him to abandon the siege: But
while these two rival monarchs were facing each other, and all the world
stood in expectation of some great event; the French found means to throw
succours into Landrecy, and having thus ef∣fected their purpose, they
skilfully made a retreat. Charles, finding the season far advanced,
despaired of success in his enterprize, and found it necessary to
raise the siege.</P>
<P><PB N="261" REF="266"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Affairs of Scotland.</NOTE> THE vanity of
Henry was flattered, by the figure which he made in the great transactions on
the continent: But the interests of his kingdom were much more deeply
concerned in the event of affairs in Scotland. Arran, the governor, was of so
indolent and unambitious a character, that had he not been stimulated by his
friends and dependants, he never had aspired to any share in the
administration; and when he found himself overpowered by the party of the
Queen dowager, the cardinal, and the earl of Lenox, he was glad to accept of
any terms of accom∣modation, however dishonourable. He even gave them a
sure pledge of his sin∣cerity, by renouncing the principles of the
reformers, and reconciling himself to the Romish communion in the
Franciscan church at Stirling. By this weakness and levity he lost his
credit with the whole nation, and rendered the protestants, who were hitherto
the chief support of his power, his most mortal enemies. The cardinal
acquired the entire ascendant in the kingdom: The Queen dowager put implicit
confidence in him: The governor was obliged to yield to him in every
pretension: Lenox alone was become an obstacle to his measures, and
re∣duced him to some difficulty.</P>
<P>THE inveterate enmity which had taken place between the families
of Lenox and Arran, made the interests of these two noblemen entirely
incompatible; and as the cardinal and the French party, in order to engage
Lenox the more in their cause, had flattered him with the hopes of
succeeding to the crown after their infant sovereign, this rivalship had
tended still farther to rouze the animosity of the Hamiltons. Lenox too had
been encouraged to aspire to the marriage of the Queen dowager, which would
have given him some pretensions to the regency; and as he was become
assuming, on account of the services which he had render∣ed the party,
the cardinal found, that, since he must choose between the friend∣ship
of Lenox and Arran, the latter nobleman, who was more easily governed, and
who was invested with present authority, was in every respect preferable.
In order to remove the former, after the easiest and least obnoxious
manner, he wrote to Francis, with whom he had entire credit, by means of the
duke of Guise, father to the Queen dowager; and after praising Lenox for
his past ser∣vices, he represented the present difficulties and
obstructions, which he occasioned in the administration, and desired
that he might be recalled to France, where he enjoyed great credit and large
possessions. But the impatience of Lenox to at∣tain his purposes,
allowed not this political artifice leisure to operate. Finding that he was
not likely to succeed in his pretensions to the Queen dowager, and that
Arran prevailed in every contest, he retired to Dunbarton, the governor of
which was entirely in his interests; he entered into a secret negociation
with the <PB N="262" REF="267"/> English court; and he summoned his clients
and par<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>izans to attend him. All
those who were inclined to the protestant religion, or were on any account
dis∣contented with the cardinal's administration, now regarded Lenox as the
head of their party, and they readily made him a tender of their services. In
a little time, he had collected an army of ten thousand men, and he threatned
his ene∣mies with immediate destruction. The cardinal had no equal force to
oppose to him; but as he was a prudent man, he foresaw that Lenox could not
long subsist so great an army, and he endeavoured to protract time, by
opening a negocia∣tion with him. He seduced his followers, by various
artifices; he engaged the Douglasses in his interests; he represented
to the whole nation the danger of civil wars and commotions. And Lenox, finding
himself engaged in an unequal contest, was at last obliged to lay down
his arms, and to accept of terms of accom∣modation with the governor and the
cardinal. Present peace was restored; but no confidence took place between
the parties. Lenox, fortifying his castles, and putting himself in a
posture of defence, waited the succours of the English, from whose
assistance alone he expected to obtain the superiority over his
ene∣mies.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1544" UNIT="year"/> WHILE the winter season
restrained Henry from military operations, he sum∣moned a new Parliament;
where a law was passed, such as he was pleased to dictate, with regard
to the succession of the crown. After declaring, that the prince of
Wales, or any of the King's male issue, were first and immediate heirs to
the kingdom, the Parliament restored the two princesses, Mary and
Elizabeth, to their right of succession. This seemed a reasonable
piece of justice, and corrected what the King's former violence had thrown
into confusion; but it was impossible for Henry to do any thing, however
laudable, without betraying, in some circum∣stances, his usual caprice
and extravagance: Tho' he opened the way for these two princesses to
mount the throne, he would not allow the act to be reversed which had
declared them both illegitimate; he made the Parliament con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er on him a power of still excluding
them, if they refused to submit to any conditions which he should be
pleased to impose; and he required them to enact, that, in default of his
own issue, he might dispose of the crown, as he pleased, by will or
letters patent. He did not probably foresee, that in proportion as he
degraded the Parliament, by rendering them the passive instrument of his
variable and violent inclinations, he taught the people to regard all their
acts as invalid, and thereby defeated even the purposes which he was so
bent to attain.</P>
<P>AN act was passed, that the King's usual stile should
be 
<Q REND="inline">"King of England, France, and Ireland, defender
of the faith, and on earth the supreme head <PB N="263" REF="268"/> of the
church of England and Ireland."</Q> It seemed a palpable inconsistency,
to retain the title of defender of the faith, which the see of Rome had
conferred on him for maintaining its cause against Luther; and yet
subjoin his ecclesiastical supremacy, in opposition to the claims of
that see.</P>
<P>AN act was also passed, for the remission of a loan of
money, which the King had lately raised. It will easily be believed, that,
after the former act of this kind, the loan was not entirely voluntary<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">35 Hen. VIII. c. 12.</NOTE>. But there was a peculiar
circum∣stance attending the present statute, which none but Henry would
have thought of: That those who had already got payment, either in whole or
in part, should re∣fund the sums to the exchequer.</P>
<P>THE oaths which Henry established for the security of his
ecclesiastical model, were not more reasonable than his other measures.
All his subjects of any dis∣tinction had already been obliged to renounce
the pope's supremacy; but as the clauses which they swore to, had not
been esteemed entirely satisfactory, another oath was imposed, and it was
added, that all those who had taken the former oaths, should be
understood to have taken the new one<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">35 Hen.
VIII. c. 1.</NOTE>. A strange supposi∣tion! to represent men as bound
by an oath which they had never consented to take.</P>
<P>THE most commendable act to which the Parliament gave their
sanction, was that by which they mitigated the law of the six articles, and
ordained, that no person should be put to his trial upon any accusation
concerning any of the of∣fences comprized in that sanguinary statute,
except on the oath of twelve per∣sons before commissioners authorized for
that purpose; and that no person should be arrested or committed to
ward for any such offence before he was indicted. Any preacher, accused of
speaking in his sermon contrary to these articles, must be indicted
within forty days.</P>
<P>THE King always experienced the limits of his exorbitant
authority whenever he demanded subsidies, however moderate, from the
Parliament; and, therefore, not to hazard a refusal, he made no mention this
session of a supply: But as his wars both with France and Scotland, as
well as his usual prodigality, had involv∣ed him in great expence, he had
recourse to other methods of filling his treasury: Notwithstanding the
former abolition of his debts, he yet required new loans from his subjects:
And he enhanced gold from forty-five shillings to forty-eight an ounce; and
silver from three shillings and nine pence to four shillings. His
pretence for this innovation, was to prevent the money from being exported; as
if that expedient could any way serve the purpose. He even coined some
base <PB N="264" REF="269"/> money, and ordered it to be current by his
proclamation. He named commis∣sioners for levying a b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nevolence, and he extorted about seventy thousand
pounds by that expedient. Read, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>derman of London<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Herbert. Stowe, p.
588. Baker, p. 292.</NOTE>, a man somewhat advanced in years, having
refused to contribute his share, or not coming up to the ex∣pectations of
the commissioners, was inrolled as a foot soldier in the Scottish wars,
and was there taken prisoner. Roach, who had been equally refractory, was
thrown into prison, and obtained not his liberty but by paying a large
composi∣tion<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Goodwin's Annals. Stowe, p. 588.</NOTE>.
These powers of the prerogative, (which at that time passed for
unques∣tioned) of the King's compelling any man to serve in any office, and
of impri∣soning any man during pleasure, not to mention the practice of
extorting loans, rendered the sovereign, in a manner, absolute master of
the person and property of every individual.</P>
<P>EARLY this year the King sent a fleet and army to invade
Scotland. The fleet consisted of near two hundred vessels, and carried
on board ten thousand men. Dudley lord Lisle commanded the sea forces;
the earl of Hertford the land. The troops were disembarked near Leith; and
after dissipating a small body which opposed them, they took that town
without resistance, and then marched to Edinburgh. The gates were soon
beat down (for little or no resistance was made); and the English first
pillaged, and then set fire to the city. The regent and cardinal were not
prepared to oppose so great a force, and they fled to Stirling. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">18th May.</NOTE> Hertford marched eastward;
and being joined by a new body under Evers, warden of the east marches, he
laid waste the whole country, burned and destroyed Hadington and Dunbar,
and then retired into England; having lost only forty men in the whole
expedition. The earl of Arran collected some forces; but finding that the
English were already departed, he turned them against Lenox, who was
justly suspected of a correspondence with the enemy. That nobleman,
after making some resistance, was obliged to fly into England; where
Henry settled a pension on him, and even gave him his niece, the lady
Margaret Douglas, in marriage. In return, Lenox stipulated conditions, by
which, had he been able to execute them, he must have reduced his country to
a total ser∣vitude<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Rymer, XV. 23,

<P>HENRY'S policy was blamed in this sudden and violent
incursion; by which he inflamed the passion of the Scotch, without
subduing their spirit; and it was commonly said, that he did too much, if
he intended to sollicit an alliance, and too little, if he meant a
conquest<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Herbert. Burnet.</NOTE>. But the
reason of his withdrawing the <PB N="265" REF="270"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> to carry on his projected
enterprize against France, where he intended to employ the whole force of his
kingdom. He had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> plan with the
emperor, which threatned the total ruin of that mo∣narchy, and
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> necessary consequence,
have involved the subjection of England. These two princes had agreed to
invade France with forces amount∣ing to above a hundred thousand men: Henry
engaged to set out from Calais; Charles from the Low Countries: They were to
enter on no siege, but leaving all the frontier towns behind them, to march
directly to Paris, where they were to join their forces, and thence to proceed
to the entire conquest of the kingdom. Francis could not oppose to these
formidable preparations, much above forty thousand men.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">14th July. Campaign in France.</NOTE> HENRY,
having appointed the Queen regent during his absence, passed over to
Calais with thirty thousand men, accompanied with the dukes of Nor∣folk and
Suffolk, Fitzalan earl of Arundel, Vere earl of Oxford, the earl of Surrey,
Paulet lord St. John, lord Ferrers of Chartley, lord Mountjoy, lord Grey of
Wilton, Sir Anthony Brown, Sir Francis Bryan, and the most flourish∣ing
nobility and gentry of his kingdom. The English army was soon joined by the
count de Buren, admiral of Flanders, with ten thousand foot, and four
thousand horse; and the whole composed an army, which nothing on that
frontier was able to resist. The chief force of the French army was drawn
to the side of Champagne, in order to oppose the imperialists.</P>
<P>THE emperor, with an army of near sixty thousand men, had
taken the field much earlier than Henry; and not to lose time, while he
waited for the march of his confederate, he sat down before Luxembourg, which
he took: He thence proceeded to Commercy on the Meuse, which was
surrendered to him: Ligny met with the same fate: He next laid siege to
St. Disier on the Marne, which, tho' a weak place, made a brave
resistance, under the count of Sancerre the go∣vernor, and the siege was
protracted beyond expectation.</P>
<P>THE emperor was employed before this town at the time the
English forces were assembled in Picardy. Henry, either tempted by the
defenceless condition of the French frontiers, or thinking that the emperor
had first broke engage∣ments by forming sieges, or, perhaps, foreseeing
the dangerous consequences of destroying entirely the French power,
instead of marching forward to Paris, sat down before Montreuil and
Boulog<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e. The duke of Norfolk
commanded the army before Montreuil: The King himself that before Boulogne.
Vervin was governor of Boulogne, and under him Philip Corse, a brave old
soldier, who encouraged the garrison to defend themselves to the last
extremity against the English. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th Septem∣ber.</NOTE> He was killed during the course of the
siege, and the town was im∣mediately <PB N="266" REF="271"/> surrendered to
Henry by the cowardice of Vervin; who was after∣wards beheaded for this
dishonourable capitulation.</P>
<P>DURING the course of this siege, Charles had taken St.
Disier; and finding the season much advanced, he began to hearken to a
treaty of peace with France, since all his schemes for subduing that
kingdom were likely to prove abortive. In order to have a pretence for
deserting his ally, he sent a messenger to the Eng∣lish camp,
requiring Henry immediately to fulfil his engagements, and to meet him with his
army before Paris. Henry replied, that he was too far engaged in the siege of
Boulogne to raise it with honour, and that the emperor himself had first
broke the concert by forming sieges. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">18th Septem∣ber.</NOTE> This answer served
Charles as a sufficient reason for concluding a peace with Francis at
Crepy, where no mention was made of the English. He stipulated to give
Flanders as a dowry to his daugh∣ter, whom he agreed to marry to the duke of
Orleans, Francis's second son; and Francis, in return, withdrew his troops
from Piemont and Savoy, and re∣nounced all claim to Milan, Naples, and other
territories in Italy. This peace, so advantageous to Francis, was procured
partly by the decisive victory obtained in the beginning of the campaign by
the count of Anguyen over the imperialists at Cerisolles in Piemont, partly
by the emperor's great desire to turn his arms against the protestant
princes in Germany. Charles ordered his troops to sepa∣rate from the
English in Picardy; 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">30th Septem∣ber.</NOTE> and Henry, finding
himself obliged to raise the siege of Montreuil, returned into England.
This campaign served, to the populace, as matter of great triumph; but all
men of sense concluded, that the King had, as in all his former military
enterprizes, made, at an infinite charge, an acquisition which was of no
manner of consequence.</P>
<P>THE war with Scotland, meanwhile, was conducted feebly, and with
various success. Sir Ralph Evers, now lord Evers, and Sir Bryan Latoun,
made an in∣road into that kingdom; and having laid waste the counties of
Tiviotdale and the Merse, they proceeded to the abbey of Coldingham, which
they took pos∣session of, and fortified. The regent assembled an
army of eight thousand men, in order to dislodge them from this post; but
he had no sooner opened his bat∣teries before the place, than a sudden
panic seized him, and he fled to Dunbar. He complained of the mutinies of his
army, and pretended to be afraid lest they should deliver him into the
hands of the English: But his own unwarlike spirit was generally believed
to have been the motive of this dishonourable re∣treat. The Scotch army, upon
the departure of their general, immediately fell into confusion; and had not
Angus, with a few of his retainers, brought off the cannon, and protected their
rear, the English might have gained great ad∣vantages over them. Evers,
elated with this success, boasted to Henry, that he <PB N="267" REF="272"/> had conquered all Scotland to the Forth; and he claimed a reward for
this im∣portant service. The duke of Norfolk, who knew with what difficulty
such acquisitions would be maintained against a warlike people, advised
the King to grant him, as his reward, the conquests of which he so highly
boasted. <MILESTONE N="1545" UNIT="year"/> The next inroad made by the
English, shewed the vanity of Evers's hopes. This gene∣ral led about five
thousand men into Tiviotdale, and was employed in ravaging that country; when
intelligence was brought him, that some Scotch forces ap∣peared near the
abbey of Melross. Angus had excited the regent to more acti∣vity; and a
proclamation being issued for assembling the troops of the neighbouring
counties, a considerable body had repaired to his standard. Norman Lesly,
son to the Earl of Rothes, had also joined the army with some volunteers
from Fife; and he inspired courage into the whole, as well by this
accession of force, as by his personal bravery and intrepidity. In order
to bring their troops to the necessity of a steddy defence, the Scotch
leaders ordered all their cavalry to dismount; and they resolved to wait,
on some high grounds at Ancram, the as∣sault of the English. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">17th of Fe∣bruary.</NOTE> The English,
whose past successes had taught them too much to despise the
enemy, thought, when they saw the Scotch horses led off the field, that the
whole army was retiring; and they hastened to attack them. The Scotch
received them in good order; and being favoured by the advantage of the ground,
as well as by the surprize of the English, who expected no re∣sistance,
they soon put them to flight, and pursued them with a considerable
flaughter. Evers and Latoun were both killed, and above a thousand men were
made prisoners. In order to support the Scotch in this war, Francis, some
time after, sent over a body of auxiliaries, to the number of three
thousand five hun∣dred men, under the command of Montgomery, lord of
Lorges<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Buchanan, lib. XV. Drummond.</NOTE>. Reinforced
by these succours, the regent assembled an army of fifteen thousand
men at Had∣ington, and marched thence to ravage the east borders of England.
They laid all waste wherever they came; and having met with no considerable
resistance, they retired into their own country, and dispersed
themselves. The earl of Hertford, in revenge, committed ravages on the middle
and west marches; and the war on both sides was signalized rather by the
ills inflicted on the enemy, than by any considerable advantage gained by
either party.</P>
<P>THE war likewise between France and England was not
distinguished this year by any memorable events. Francis had equipped a
fleet of above two hundred fail, be∣sides gallies; and having embarked some
land forces on board, he sent them to make a descent in England<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Beleair. Memoires du Bellay.</NOTE>. They failed to
the Isle of Wight, where they found the <PB N="268" REF="273"/> English
fleet lying at anchor in St. Helens. It consisted not of above an hundred
fail; and the admiral thought it most adviseable to remain in that road, in
hopes of drawing the French into the narrow passages and rocks, which were
unknown to them. The two fleets cannonaded one another for two days; and except
the sinking of the Mary Rose, one of the largest ships of the
Eng∣lish fleet, the damage on both sides was inconsiderable. The French
landed troops in the Isle of Wight, and committed ravages; but being
repulsed by the militia of the country, they retired to their ships, which
soon after set sail for France. They were again driven by the wind on the
coast of England, where they met with the English fleet; and a new
cannonading ensued, which proved no more decisive than the foregoing. It
was indeed scarce possible, that a fleet at that time could, without
boarding, gain any considerable advantage over the enemy. The cannon were
commonly so ill served, that a French writer of me∣moirs<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">De Langey.</NOTE>observes, as a circumstance some what
singular, that each of these nume∣rous fleets in a two hours engagement,
fired full three hundred shot. One large ship in our time could, without
difficulty, do as much.</P>
<P>FRANCIS'S chief intention, in equipping so great a fleet, was
to prevent the English from throwing succours into Boulogne, which he
intended to besiege; and for that purpose, he ordered a fort to be built,
by which he proposed to block up the harbour. After a considerable loss
of money and time, the fort was found so ill constructed, that he was
obliged to abandon it; and tho' he had brought together, on that frontier, an
army of near forty thousand men, he was not able to effect any considerable
enterprize. He broke into the territory of Oye, an extent of country which lies
near Calais, and which served commonly to supply the garrison with
provisions; and he laid it entirely waste by fire and sword. Several
skirmishes ensued between the French and English, in one of which the
duke of Aumale received a remarkable wound. A lance was run into his head
between his eye and nose; and notwithstanding that the lance broke and the
head of it remained in the wound, he was not dismounted by so violent a
shock, and the head of the lance being extracted by a skilful surgeon, he
afterwards recovered, and rendered himself extremely famous by the name of
the duke of Guise. Henry, in order to defend his dominions in France, had
levied fourteen thousand Germans; who, having marched to Fleurines in the
bishopric of Liege, found they could advance no farther. The Emperor would
not allow them a passage through his dominions: They received intelligence
of a superior army on the side of France ready to intercept them:
Idleness and want of pay soon bred a mutiny among them: And having seized
the English <PB N="269" REF="274"/> commissaries as a security for
arrears, they retreated into their own country. There seems to have been
some want of foresight and contrivance in this expen∣sive armament.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">23 November.</NOTE> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Parliament.</NOTE> THE great expence of
these two wars, maintained by Henry, obliged him to sum∣mon a new
Parliament. The commons granted him a subsidy, payable in two years, of two
shillings a pound on land<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Those who
possessed goods or money, above five pound and below ten, were to pay
eight pence a pound: Those above ten pound, a shilling.</NOTE>: The
spirituality voted him six shil∣lings a pound. But the Parliament,
apprehensive lest more demands should be made upon them, thought to
save themselves by a very extraordinary libe∣rality of other people's
property; and by one vote they bestowed on the King the whole revenues of the
universities, as well as of the chauntries, free chappels<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">A chauntry was a little church, chappel, or particular altar in
some cathedral church, &amp;c. endowed with lands or other revenues for
maintainance of one or more priests, daily to say mass or perform di∣vine
service, for the use of the founders, or such others as they appointed:
Free chappels were inde∣pendant on any church, and endowed for much the same
purpose as the former. <HI>Jacob's Law
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI></NOTE>, and hospitals.
Henry was pleased with this concession, as it encreased his power; but
he had no intention of despoiling learning of all her endowments; and he
soon took care to inform the universities, that he meant not to touch their
re∣venues. Thus these antient and celebrated establishments owed their
subsistance to the generosity of the King, not to the protection of
this servile and prostitute Parliament.</P>
<P>THE prostitute spirit of the Parliament appeared farther in
the preamble of a statute<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">37 Hen. VIII. c.
17.</NOTE>; where they recognize the King to have always been by the word of
God supreme head of the church of England, and acknowlege, that
archbishops, bishops, and other ecclesiastical persons, have no
manner of jurisdiction but by his royal mandate: To him alone, and such
persons as he shall appoint, full au∣thority and power is given from above
to hear and determine all manner of causes ecclesiastical, and to correct
all manner of heresies, errors, vices and sins whatso∣ever. No mention is
here made of the concurrence of a convocation, nor even of a Parliament. His
proclamations are acknowleged to have not only the force of a law, but the
authority of a revelation; and by his royal power he may regulate the actions
of men, and even direct their inward sentiments and opinions.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">24 December.</NOTE> THE King made in person
a speech to the Parliament on proroguing them; where, after thanking them for
their loving attachment to him, which, he said, equalled what was ever paid
by their ancestors to any King of England, he com∣plained of their
dissensions, disputes and animosities in religion. He told them, 
<PB N="270" REF="275"/> that the several pulpits were become a kind of
batteries against each other; and that one preacher called another heretic
and anabaptist, which was retaliated by the op∣probious terms of papist and
hypocrite: That he had permitted his people the use of the scriptures, not
in order to furnish them materials for dispute and railing, but that he
might enable them to inform their consciences and instruct their children
and families: That it grieved his heart to find how that precious jewel was
pro∣stituted, by being introduced into the conversation of every alehouse
and tavern, and employed as a pretence for decrying the spiritual and legal
pastors: And that he was sorry to observe, that the word of God, while it
was the object of so much anxious speculation, had very little influence on
their practice; and that tho' an imaginary knowlege so much abounded, charity
was daily going to decay<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hall, fol 261. Herbert, p.
534.</NOTE>. The King gave good advice; but his own example, by encouraging
speculation and dispute, was ill qualified to promote that peaceable
submission of opinion, which he recommended.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1546" UNIT="year"/> HENRY employed in military
preparations the money granted by Parliament; and he sent over the earl of
Hertford, and lord Lisle the admiral, to Calais with a body of nine
thousand men, two thirds of which consisted of foreigners. Some
skirmishes ensued of small consequence; and no hopes of any
considerable pro∣gress could be entertained by either side. Henry,
whose animosity against Francis was not violent, had given sufficient
vent to his humour by this short war; and finding, that from his great
encrease in corpulence and decay in strength, he could not hope for much
longer life, he was desirous of ending a quarrel, which might prove dangerous
to his kingdom during a minority. Francis likewise, on his part, was not
averse to peace with England; because, having lately lost his son, the
duke of Orleans, he revived his antient claim upon Milan, and foresaw, that
hostilities must soon, on that account, break out between him and the
Em∣peror. Commissioners therefore having met at Campe, a place between
Ardres and Guisnes, the articles were soon agreed, and the peace signed
by them. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">7th of June. Peace with France and
Scotland.</NOTE> The chief conditions were, that Henry should retain Boulogne
during eight years, or till the former debt due by Francis should be paid.
This debt was settled at two millions of livres, besides a claim of 500,000
livres, which was afterwards to be adjusted. Francis took care to comprehend
Scotland in the treaty. Thus all that Henry obtained by a war, which cost him
above one million three hun∣dred and forty thousand pounds sterling<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Herbert, Stowe.</NOTE>, was a bad security for a
debt, which was not a third of the value.</P>
<P><PB N="271" REF="276"/> THE King, being now freed from all
foreign wars, had leisure to give his at∣tention to domestic affairs; and
particularly to the establishment of uniformity of opinion, on which he was
so intent. Tho' he allowed an English translation of the Bible, he had
hitherto been very careful to keep the mass in Latin; but he was at last
prevailed with to permit, that the Litany, a considerable part of the public
wor∣ship, should be celebrated in the vulgar tongue; and by this
innovation, he excited anew the hopes of the reformers, who had been somewhat
discouraged by the se∣verity of the statute of the six articles. One
petition of the new Litany was a prayer to save us <HI>from the tyranny of
the bishop of Rome, and from all his detestable en∣ormities.</HI> Cranmer
was employing his authority to engage Henry to farther inno∣vations, and he
took advantage of Gardiner's absence, who was employed in an embassy to
the emperor; but Gardiner, having wrote to the King, that, if he carried his
opposition against the catholic religion to greater extremities, Charles
threatened to break off all commerce with him, the success of Cranmer's
projects was for the time retarded. Cranmer lost this year the most
sincere and most powerful friend, whom he possessed at court;
Charles Brandon, duke of Suffolk: The Queen dowager of France, spouse to
Suffolk, had died some years before. This nobleman is one instance, that
Henry was not altogether incapable of a cordial and steady friendship; and
Suffolk seems to have been entirely worthy of that favour, which, from his
earliest youth, he had enjoyed with him. The King was sitting in council
when informed of Suffolk's death; and he took that occasion both to express
his own sorrow for the loss, and to celebrate the merits of the deceased.
He de∣clared, that, during the whole course of their correspondence, he had
not made any attempt to injure an adversary, and had never whispered a word
to the dis∣advantage of any one. 
<Q REND="inline">"Is there any of you, my lords, who can say as
much?"</Q> When the King subjoined these words, he looked round in all
their faces, and saw that confusion, which the consciousness of
secret guilt threw upon them<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Coke's Inst. cap.
99.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>CRANMER himself, when bereaved of this support, was the more
exposed to those cabals of the courtiers, which the opposition of party
and religion, joined to the usual motives of interest, rendered so eager
among Henry's ministers and counsellors. The catholics took advantage of
the King's passion for orthodoxy; and they represented to him, that, if
his laudable zeal for inforcing the truth met with no greater success, it
was owing altogether to the primate, whose example and encouragement were, in
reality, the secret supports of heresy. Henry, see∣ing the point to
which they tended, feigned a compliance, and desired the coun∣cil to make
enquiry into Cranmer's conduct; promising that, if he was found guilty, he
should send him to the Tower, and bring him to condign punishment. 
<PB N="272" REF="277"/> All the world now gave the primate for lost; and his
old friends, from merce∣nary views, as well as the opposite party, from
animosity, began to show him marks of neglect and disregard. He was
obliged to stand several hours among the lacqueys at the door of the
council-chamber, before he could be admitted; and when he was at last called
in, he was told, that they had determined to send him to the Tower. Cranmer
said, that he appealed to the King himself; and finding his appeal
disregarded, he produced a ring, which Henry had given him as a pledge of
favour and protection. The council were confounded; and when they came before
the King, he reproved them in the severest terms, and told them, that he
was well acquainted with Cranmer's merit, as well as with their malignity and
envy: But he was determined to crush all their cabals, and to teach them, by
the severest discipline, since gentle methods were vain, a more dutiful
concurrence in promoting his service. Norfolk, who was Cranmer's capi∣tal
enemy, apologized for their conduct, by saying, that their only intention was
to set the primate's innocence in a full light by bringing him to an open
trial: And Henry obliged them all to embrace him, as a sign of their cordial
reconcile∣ment. The mild temper of Cranmer rendered this reconcilement more
sincere on his part, than is usual in such forced compliances<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. i. p.
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Antiq. Brit. in vita

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Persecutions.</NOTE> BUT tho' Henry's
partiality to Cranmer rendered fruitless all accusations against him, his
pride and peevishness, irritated by his declining state of health,
carried him to punish with fresh severity all others who presumed to
entertain a different opinion from himself, particularly in the capital point
of the real presence. Anne Ascue, a young woman of merit as well as
beauty<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Dale, Speed, 780.</NOTE>, who had great
connexions with the chief ladies at court, and with the Queen herself, was
accused of dogma∣ti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing on that
delicate article; and Henry, instead of having indulgence to the weakness
of her sex and age, was but the more provoked, that a woman should dare to
oppose his theological sentiments. She was prevailed on by Bonner's
me∣naces to make a seeming recantation; but she qualified it with some
reserves, which did not satisfy that zealous prelate. She was thrown into
prison, and there employed herself in composing prayers and
discourses, by which she forti∣fied her resolution to endure the
utmost extremity rather than relinquish her reli∣gious principles. She even
wrote to the King, and told him, that as to the Lord's Supper, she believed
as much as Christ himself had said of it, and as much of his divine
doctrine as the catholic church had required: But while she could not be
brought to acknowlege an assent to the King's explications, this
declaration availed her nothing, and was rather regarded as a fresh insult.
The chancellor, Wriothesely, who had succeeded Audley, and who was much
attach∣ed <PB N="273" REF="278"/> to the catholic party, was sent to examine
her with regard to her patrons at court, and the great ladies who were in
correspondence with her: But she main∣tained a very laudible fidelity to
her friends, and would confess nothing. She was put to the torture in the
most cruel manner, and continued still resolute in pre∣serving
secrecy. Some authors<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Fox, vol. ii. p. 578.
Speed, p. 780. Baker, p. 299. But Burnet questions the truth of this
cir∣cumstance: Fox, however, transcribes her own paper, where she relates
it. I must add, in justice to the King, that he disapproved of
Wriothesely's conduct, and commended the lieutenant.</NOTE>add a very
extraordinary circumstance: That the chancellor, who stood by, ordered the
lieutenant of the Tower to stretch the rack farther; but the lieutenant
refused compliance with that cruelty: The chan∣cellor menaced him; but met
with a new refusal: Upon which that magistrate, who was otherwise a
person of merit, but intoxicated with religious zeal, put his own hand to the
rack, and drew it so violently that he almost tore her body asunder. Her
constancy still surpassed the barbarity of her persecutors, and
they found all their efforts to be baffled. She was then condemned to be burned
alive; and being so dislocated by the rack, that she could not stand,
she was carried to the stake in a chair. Together with her, were brought
Nicholas Belenian, a priest, John Lassels of the King's family, and John
Adams a taylor, who had been condemned for the same crime to the same
punishment. They were all tied to the stake; and in that dreadful
situation, the chancellor sent to inform them, that their pardon was ready
drawn and signed, and should instantly be given them, if they would merit
it by a recantation. They only regarded this offer as a new ornament to their
crown of martyrdom; and they saw with tranquillity the executioner kindle the
flames which consumed them. Wriothesely did not consider, that this
public and noted situation interested their honour the more to maintain a
steady perseverance.</P>
<P>BUT tho' the secrecy and fidelity of Anne Ascue saved the
Queen from this peril, she soon after fell into a new danger, from which
she very narrowly escaped. There was an ulcer broke out in the King's leg,
which, joined to his extreme corpulency and his bad habit of body, began both
to threaten his life, and to render him, even more than usual, peevish and
passionate. The Queen, during this time, attended him with the most
tender and dutiful care, and endeavoured, by every soothing art and
compliance, to allay those gusts of humour, to which he was become so
subject. His favourite topic of conversation was theology; and Catherine,
whose good sense made her capable of discoursing on any subject,
was frequently engaged into the argu∣ment; and being secretly inclined to the
principles of the reformers, she un∣warily discovered too much of her mind
on these occasions. Henry, highly pro∣voked <PB N="274" REF="279"/> that
she should presume to differ from him, made complaints of her
ob∣stinacy to Gardiner, who gladly laid hold of the opportunity to inflame
the quar∣rel. He praised the King's anxious care of preserving the
orthodoxy of his sub∣jects; and represented, that the more elevated the
person was who was chastised, and the more near to his person, the
greater terror would the example strike into every one, and the more glorious
would the sacrifice appear to all posterity. The chancellor, being
consulted, was engaged by religious zeal to second these to∣pics; and
Henry, hurried by his own impetuous temper, and encouraged by his
counsellors, went so far as to order articles of impeachment to be drawn up
against his consort. Wriothesely executed his commands; and soon after
brought the paper to him to be signed: For as it was high treason to throw
slander upon the Queen, he might otherwise have been questioned for his
temerity. In going home, he chanced to drop this important paper from his
pocket; and as some person of the Queen's party found it, it was
immediately carried to her. She was sensible of the extreme danger to which
she was exposed; but did not de∣spair of being able, by her prudence and
address, still to elude the efforts of her enemies. She paid her usual
visit to the King, and found him in a more serene disposition than
she had reason to expect. He entered on the subject which was so
familiar to him, and he seemed to challenge her to an argument in divinity.
She gently declined the conversation, and observed, that such profound
specula∣tions were ill suited to the natural imbecillity of her sex.
Women, she said, by their first creation, were made subject to men: The
male was created after the image of God; the female after the image of the
male: It belonged to the hus∣band to choose principles for his wife; the
wife's duty was, in all cases, to adopt implicitely the sentiments of her
husband: And as to herself, it was doubly her duty, being blest with a
husband, who was qualified, by his judgment and learn∣ing, not only to
choose principles for his own family, but for the most wise and knowing
of every nation. 
<Q REND="inline">"Not so! by St. Mary," replied the King, "you
are now become a doctor, Kate; and better fitted to give than receive
in∣structions."</Q> She meekly replied, that she was sensible how
little she was in∣titled to these praises; that tho' she usually
declined not any conversation, how∣ever sublime, when proposed by his
majesty, she well knew, that her concep∣tions could serve to no other
purpose than to give him a little momentary amuse∣ment; that she found
the conversation apt to languish when not revived by some opposition,
and had ventured sometimes to feign a contrariety of sentiments, in order
to give him the pleasure of refuting her; and that she also proposed,
by this innocent artifice, to engage him into topics, whence, she had
observed, by her frequent experience, that she reaped profit and
instruction. 
<Q REND="inline">"And is it so, <PB N="275" REF="280"/>
sweet-heart?" replied the King, "then are we perfect friends again."</Q> He
embraced her with great affection, and sent her away with assurances of
his pro∣tection and kindness. Her enemies, who knew nothing of this turn,
pre∣pared next day to convey her to the Tower, pursuant to the King's
warrant. Henry and Catherine were conversing amicably in the garden, when the
chancel∣lor appeared with forty of the pursuivants. The King spoke to him
at some dis∣tance from her; and seemed to expostulate with him in the
severest manner: She even overheard the terms of <HI>knave, fool,</HI> and
<HI>beast,</HI> which he very liberally bestowed upon that magistrate;
and then ordered him to depart his presence. She afterwards interposed to
mitigate his anger: He said to her, 
<Q REND="inline">"Poor soul! you know not how little intitled
this man is to your good offices."</Q> From thenceforth, the Queen, having
narrowly escaped so great a danger, was careful not to offend Henry's
humour by any contradiction; and Gardiner, whose ma∣lice had endeavoured to
widen the breach, could never afterwards recover his fa∣vour and good
opinion<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. i. p. 344. Herbert, p. 560. Speed,
p 780. Fox's Acts and Monuments, vol. ii. p. 58.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT Henry's tyrannical disposition, soured by ill health,
burst out soon after to the destruction of a man, who possessed a
much superior rank to Gardi∣ner. The duke of Norfolk and his father, during
this whole reign, and even a great part of the foregoing, had been regarded as
the greatest subjects in the king∣dom, and had rendered very considerable
services to the crown. The duke himself had in his youth distinguished
himself by naval enterprizes: He had much contri∣buted to the victory over
the Scotch at Flouden: He had suppressed a dangerous rebellion in the
North: And he had always done his part with honour in all the expeditions
against France. Fortune seemed to conspire with his own industry, in
raising him to the highest elevation. By the favours heaped on him from the
crown, he had acquired an immense estate: The King had successively
been mar∣ried to two of his nieces; and the King's son, the duke of Richmond,
had mar∣ried his daughter: Besides his descent from the antient family of
the Moubrays, by which he was allied to the throne, he had espoused a
daughter of the duke of Buckingham, who was descended by a female from Edward
the third: And as he was believed still to adhere secretly to the antient
religion, he was regarded, abroad and at home, as the head of the catholic
party. But all these circum∣stances, in proportion as they exalted the
duke, provoked the jealousy of Henry; and he soresaw danger, during his
son's minority, both to the public tranquil∣lity, and to the new
ecclesiastical system, from the attempts of so potent a sub∣ject.
But nothing tended more to expose Norfolk to the King's vengeance, 
<PB N="276" REF="281"/> than the prejudices, which Henry had entertained
against the earl of Surrey, son to that nobleman.</P>
<P>SURREY was a young man of the most promising hopes, and had
distinguish∣ed himself by every accomplishment, which became a
scholar, a courtier, and a soldier. He excelled in all the military
exercises, which were then in request: He encouraged the fine arts by his
patronage and example: He had made some successful attempts in poetry;
and being smit with the romantic gallantry of that age, he celebrated his
mistress's praise by his pen and his lance, in every masque and
tournament. His spirit and ambition were equal to his talents and his
quality; and he did not always regulate his conduct by that caution and
reserve, which his situation required. He had been left governor of
Boulogne, when that town was taken by Henry; but tho' his personal bravery
was unquestioned, he had been unfortunate in some rencounters with the
French. The King, some∣what displeased with his conduct, had sent over
Hertford to command in his place; and Surrey was so imprudent as to drop
some menacing expressions against the ministers, on account of this
affront, which was put upon him. And as he had refused to marry Hertford's
daughter, and even waved every pro∣posal of marriage, which were made him;
Henry imagined, that he had enter∣tained views of espousing the lady Mary;
and he was instantly determined to re∣press, by the most severe
expedients, so dangerous an ambition.</P>
<P>ACTUATED by all these motives, and perhaps too influenced by
that old disgust, with which the ill conduct of Catherine Howard had
inspired him against all her family, he gave private orders to arrest
Norfolk and Surrey; and they were on the same day confined to the Tower.
<MILESTONE N="1547" UNIT="year"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">12th of De∣cember.</NOTE> Surrey being a
commoner, his trial was the more expeditious; and as to proofs, neither
parliaments nor juries seem ever to have given the least attention to them
in any cause of the crown, during this whole reign. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Execution of the earl of Surr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y.</NOTE> He was accused, that he had
entertained in his family some Italians who were <HI>suspected</HI> to be
spies; a servant of his had paid a visit to cardinal Pole in Italy,
whence he was <HI>suspected</HI> of entertaining a correspondence with
that obnoxious prelate; he had quartered the arms of Edward the Confessor
on his scutcheon, which made him be <HI>suspected</HI> of aspiring to
the crown, tho' both he and his ancestors had openly, during the course of
many years, maintained that practice; and the heralds had even justified it
by their authority. These were the crimes, for which a jury,
notwithstanding his eloquent and spirited de∣fence, condemned this nobleman
for high treason; and their sentence was soon after executed upon
him.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Attainder of the duke of Norfolk.</NOTE> THE
innocence of the duke of Norfolk was still, if possible, more apparent
than that of his son; as his services to the crown had been much greater.
His <PB N="277" REF="282"/> dutchess, with whom he lived on bad terms, had
been so base as to carry intel∣ligence to his enemies of all she knew
against him: Elizabeth Holland, a mis∣tress of his, had been equally
subservient to the designs of the court: Yet with all these advantages
his accusers discovered no greater crime, than that he had once said,
that the King was sickly, and could not hold out long, and the king∣dom was
likely to fall into disorders, thro' the diversity of religious opinions.
He wrote a m st pathetic letter to the King, pleading his past services,
and pro∣testing his innocence: Soon after he embraced a more proper expedient
for ap∣peasing Henry, by making a submission and confession, such
as his enemies re∣quired: But nothing could mollify the unrelenting temper of
the King. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">14th January.</NOTE> He assembled the
Parliament, as the surest and most expeditious instrument of his
tyranny; and the house of peers, without examining the prisoner, without
trial or evidence, passed a bill of attainder against him, and sent it
down to the com∣mons. Cranmer, tho' engaged for many years in an opposite
party to Norfolk, and tho' he had received many and great injuries from him,
would have no hand in so unjust a prosecution, and retired to his seat
at Croydon<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. i. p. 348. Fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE>. The King was now approaching
fast towards his end; and▪ fearing lest Norfolk should escape him,
he sent a message to the commons, by which he desired them to hasten
the bill, under pretence, that Norfolk enjoyed the dignity of earl marshal,
and it was necessary to appoint another, who might officiate at the
ensuing ceremony of installing his son, prince of Wales. The obsequious
commons obeyed his di∣rections, tho' founded on so frivolous a pretence; and
the King, having affixed the royal assent to the bill by commissioners,
issued orders for the execution of Norfolk on the morning of the twenty
ninth of January. But news being car∣ried to the Tower, that the King himself
had expired that night, the lieutenant deferred the execution of the warrant,
and it was not thought advisable by the council, to begin a new reign by the
death of the greatest nobleman in the king∣dom, who had been condemned by a
sentence so unjust and tyrannical.</P>
<P>THE King's health had been long in a very declining condition;
but for several days all those near him plainly saw his death
approaching. He was become so froward, that no one durst inform him of his
condition; and as some persons, during this reign, had been punished as
traitors for foretelling the King's death<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Lanquet's Epitome of chronicles in the year 1541.</NOTE>, every
one was afraid, left, in the transports of his fury, he might, on this
pre∣tence, inflict punishment on the author of such friendly intelligence.
At last, Sir Anthony Denny ventured to disclose to him the fatal
secret, and exhorted him to prepare for the fate which was awaiting him. He
expressed his resigna∣tion; <PB N="278" REF="283"/> and desired that
Cranmer might be sent for: But before that prelate ar∣rived, he was
speechless, tho' he still seemed to retain his senses. Cranmer
de∣sired him to give some sign of his dying in the faith of Christ: 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Death of the King.</NOTE> He squeezed his
hand, and immediately expired, after a reign of▪ thirty-seven years and
nine months; and in the fifty-sixth year of his age.</P>
<P>THE King had made his will near a month before his decease;
where he con∣firmed the destination of Parliament, in leaving the crown
first to prince Edward, then to the lady Mary, next to the lady Elizabeth:
The two princesses he ob∣liged, under the penalty of forfeiting their title
to the crown, not to marry with∣out the consent of the council, which he
appointed for the government of his minor son. After his own children, he
settled the succession on Frances Bran∣don, marchioness of Dorset,
eldest daughter to his sister, the French Queen; then on Eleonor,
countess of Cumberland, the second daughter. In passing over the
posterity of the Queen of Scots, his eldest sister, he made use of
the power obtained from Parliament; but as he subjoined, that after the
failure of the French Queen's posterity, the crown should descend to the
next lawful heir, it afterwards became a question, whether these words
could be applied to the Scottish line. It was thought, that these princes
were not the next heirs after the house of Suffolk, but before that house,
and that Henry, by expressing him∣self in this manner, meant entirely to
exclude them. The late injuries which he had received from the Scotch, had
irritated him extremely against that nation; and he maintained to the last
the character of violence and caprice, by which his life had been so much
distinguished. Another circumstance of his will may suggest the
same reflection with regard to the strange contrarieties of his temper and
conduct: He left money for masses to be said for delivering his soul
from pur∣gatory; and tho' he destroyed all those institutions,
established by his ancestors, and others, for the benefit of
<HI>their</HI> souls, and had even left the doctrine of pur∣gatory doubtful
in all the articles of faith which he published during his latter years, he
was yet determined, when matters came to the last, to take care, at least,
of his own future repose, and to adhere to the safer side of the
question<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See his will in Fuller, Heylin, and
Rymer, p. 110. There is no reasonable ground to suspect its
authenticity.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">His character.</NOTE> IT is difficult to give
a just summary of this prince's qualities: He was so different from
himself in different parts of his reign, that, as is well remarked by lord
Herbert, his history is his best character and description. The
absolute, uncontrouled authority which he maintained at home, and the regard
which he acquired among foreign nations, are circumstances which entitle him
to the ap∣pellation of a <HI>great</HI> prince; while his tyranny, and cruelty,
seem to exclude him <PB N="279" REF="284"/> from the character of a
<HI>good</HI> one. He possessed, indeed, great vigour of mind, which
qualified him for exercising dominion over men; courage, intrepidity,
vigilance, inflexibility: And tho' these qualities lay not always under the
guid∣ance of a regular and folid judgment, they were accompanied with good
parts, and an extensive capacity; and every one dreaded a contest with a
man who was known never to yield, or to forgive, and who, in every
controversy, was deter∣mined, either to ruin himself or his antagonist. A
catalogue of his vices would comprehend many of the worst qualities incident
to human nature: Violence, cruelty, profusion, rapacity, injustice,
obstinacy, arrogance, bigotry, presump∣tion, caprice: But neither was he
subject to all these vices in the most extreme degree, nor was he, at
intervals, altogether devoid of virtues: He was sincere, open, gallant,
liberal, and capable at least of a temporary friendship and attach∣ment. In
this respect he was unfortunate, that the incidents of his times served to
display his faults in their full light: The treatment which he met with from
the court of Rome, provoked him to violence; the danger of a revolt from his
superstitious subjects, seemed to require the most extreme
severity. But it must, at the same time, be acknowledged, that his
situation tended to throw an additi∣onal lustre on what was great and
magnanimous in his character: The emulation between the emperor and the French
King, rendered his alliance, notwithstand∣ing his impolitic conduct, of great
importance in Europe: The extensive powers of his prerogative, and the
submissive, not to say slavish, disposition of his Par∣liament,
made it the more easy for him to assume and maintain that entire
domi∣nion by which his reign is so much distinguished in the English
history.</P>
<P>IT may seem a little extraordinary, that notwithstanding his
cruelty, his ex∣tortion, his violence, his arbitrary administration, this
prince not only acquired the regard of his subjects; but never was the object
of their hatred: He seems even in some degree to have possessed, to
the last, their love and affection<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Strype, vol
I. p. 389.</NOTE>. His exterior qualities were advantageous, and fit to
captivate the multitude: His magnificence and personal bravery rendered him
illustrious in vulgar eyes: And it may be said, with truth, that the
English in that age, were so thoroughly sub∣dued, that, like eastern
slaves, they were inclined to admire even those acts of violence and
tyranny, which were exercised over themselves, and at their own
expence.</P>
<P>WITH regard to foreign states, Henry appears long to have
supported an in∣tercourse of friendship with Francis, more sincere and
disinterested than usually takes place between neighbouring princes.
Their common jealousy of the em∣peror Charles, and some resemblance in
their characters, (tho' the comparison is <PB N="280" REF="285"/> extremely to
the advantage of the French monarch) served as the cement of their mutual
amity. Francis is said to have been affected with the King's death, and to
have expressed much regret for the loss. His own health began to decline:
He foretold, that he would not long survive his friend<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Le Thou.</NOTE>: And he died in about two months after him.</P>
<P>THERE were ten Parliaments summoned by Henry the eighth, and
twenty∣three sessions held. The whole time in which these Parliaments
sat during this long reign, exceeded not three years and a half. It amounted
not to a year dur∣ing the first twenty years. The innovations in religion
obliged him afterwards to call these assemblies more frequently: But tho'
these were the most important transactions that ever fell under the
cognizance of Parliament, their devoted at∣tachment to Henry's will, joined to
their earnest desire of returning soon to their country seats, produced
a very quick dispatch of the bills, and made the sessions of short
duration. All the King's caprices were▪ indeed, blindly complied with, and
no regard was payed to the safety or liberty of the subject. Besides the
vio∣lent prosecution of whatever he was pleased to call heresy, the laws
of treason were multiplied beyond all former precedent. Even words to the
disparagement of the King, Queen, or royal issue, were subjected to
that penalty; and so little care was taken in framing these rigorous
statutes, that they contain obvious con∣tradictions; insomuch, that, had
they been strictly executed, every man, with∣out exception, must have
fallen under the penalty of treason. By one statute<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">28 Hen. VIII. c. 7.</NOTE>, for instance, it was
declared treason to assert the validity of the King's marriage, either
with Catherine of Arragon, or Anne Bo'eyn: By another<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">34, 35 Hen. VIII. c 1.</NOTE>, it was trea∣son to say any
thing to the disparagement or slander of the princesses, Mary and
Elizabeth; and to call them spurious would, no doubt, be construed to their
slander. Nor would even a profound silence with regard to these delicate
points, be able to save a person from such penalties. For by the former
statute, whoever refused to answer upon oath to any point contained in
that act, was subjected to the pains of treason. The King, therefore,
needed only to propose to any one a question with regard to the legality of
either of his first marriages: If the per∣son was silent, he was a
traytor by law: If he answered, either in the negative or in the affirmative,
he was no less a traytor. So monstrous were the inconsistencies, which
arose from the furious passions of the King, and the slavish
obedience of his Par∣liaments. It is hard to say, whether these
contradictions were owing to Henry's precipitancy, or to a formed design of
tyranny.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">His laws.</NOTE> IT may not be improper to
recapitulate whatever is memorable in the statutes of this reign, whether
with regard to police or commerce: Nothing can better <PB N="281" REF="286"/>
show the genius of the age than such a review of the laws. The abolition of
the ancient religion contributed much to the regular execution of justice.
While the catholic superstition subsisted, there was no
possibility of punishing any crimes in the clergy: The church would not
allow the magistrate to try the offences of her members, and she could not
herself inflict any civil penalties upon them. But Henry restrained these
pernicious exemptions: The privilege of clergy was abolished for the crimes
of petty treason, murder, and felony, to all under the degree of a
subdeacon<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">23 Hen. VIII. c. 1.</NOTE>. But the
former superstition not only protected crimes in the clergy: It exempted
also the laity from punishment, by affording them shelter in the churches
and sanctuaries. The Parliament restrained these abuses. It was first
declared, that no fanctuaries were allowed in cases of high treason<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">26 Hen. VIII. c. 13.</NOTE>; next, in those of
murder, felony, rapes, burglary, and petty-treason<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">32 Hen. VIII. c. 12.</NOTE>: And it limited them in other
particulars<NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">22 Hen. VIII. c. 14.</NOTE>. The only
expedient employed to support the military spirit during this age, was the
reviving and extending some old laws, enacted for the encouragement of
archery, on which the defence of the kingdom was supposed very much to
depend. Every man was ordered to have a bow<NOTE N="††" PLACE="foot">3 Hen. VIII. c. 3.</NOTE>: Buts were ordered to be erected in
every parish<NOTE N="‡‡" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>: And every
bowyer was or∣dered, for each bow of yew which he made, to make two of elm or
wich, for the service of the common people<NOTE N="‖‖" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. The use of cross-bows and hand-guns was also
prohibited<NOTE N="§§" PLACE="foot">3 Hen. VIII. c. 13.</NOTE>. What
rendered the English bowmen more formidable was, that they carried halberts
with them, by which they were enabled, upon occasion, to engage in close
fight with the enemy<NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">Herbert.</NOTE>. Frequent
musters or ar∣rays were also made of the people, even during time of peace;
and all men of substance were obliged to have a compleat suit of armour
or harness, as it was called<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hall, fol. 234. Stowe,
p. 515. Hollingshed, p. 947.</NOTE>. The martial spirit of the English,
during that age, rendered this precaution, it was thought, sufficient for the
defence of the nation; and as the King had then an absolute power of
commanding the service of all his subjects, he could presently, in case
of danger, appoint new officers, and levy regiments, and collect an army as
numerous as he pleased. Where no faction or division prevailed among the
people, there was no foreign power that ever dared to think of invading
England. There is a saying of Francis the first, which shows the
esti∣mation in which the nation was held in Europe. That magnanimous prince
boasted, that, notwithstanding the combination of Charles and Henry
against him, in the year 1524, he would be able to defend himself. Spain,
says he, has no money; the Low Countries have no soldiers: And as to
England, my fron∣tier <PB N="282" REF="287"/> is strong on that side<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">P. Daniel.</NOTE>. The city of London alone could
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uster fifteen thousand
men<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Hall, fol. 235. Hollingshed, p. 547.
Stowe, p. 547.</NOTE>. Discipline, however, was an advantage wanting to
these troops; tho' the garrison of Calais was a nursery of officers; and
Tournay first<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Hall, fol. 68.</NOTE>,
Bou∣lougne afterwards, served to increase the number, Every one, who
served abroad, was allowed to alienate his lands without paying any fees<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">14 and 15 Hen. VIII. c. 15.</NOTE>. A general
permission was granted to dispose of land by will<NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">34 and 35 Hen. VIII. c. 5.</NOTE>. The Parliament were so little
jealous of their privileges, (which indeed were scarce worth preserving)
that there is an instance of one Strode, who, because he introduced into
the lower house some bill regarding tin, was very severely treated by the
Stannery courts of Cornwal: Heavy fines were imposed on him; and upon his
refusal to pay, he was thrown into a dungeon, loaded with irons, and used
in such a manner as brought his life in danger: Yet all the notice which the
Parliament took of this enormity, even in such an inferior court, was to
enact, that no man could be questioned afterwards for his conduct in
Parliament<NOTE N="††" PLACE="foot">4 Hen. VIII. c. 8.</NOTE>.
This prohibition, how∣ever, must only be extended to the inferior courts: For
as to the King and privy council, and star-chamber, they were scarce bound
by any law. There is a bill of tonnage and poundage, which shows what
uncertain ideas the Parliament had formed both of their own privileges and of
the rights of the sovereign<NOTE N="‡‡" PLACE="foot">6 Hen.
VIII. c. 14.</NOTE>. This duty had been voted to every King since Edward the
fourth, during the term of his own life: Yet Henry had already been allowed to
levy it six years without any law; and tho' there had been four Parliaments
assembled, no at∣tention had been given either to grant it to him
regularly, or restrain him from levying it. At last, they resolved to
give him that supply; but even in this concession, they show
themselves plainly at a loss to determine whether they grant it, or whether
he has a right of himself to levy it. They say, that the im∣position was
made to endure during the natural life of the late King, and no longer: They
yet blame the merchants who had not paid to the present King that duty: They
observe, that the law for tonnage and poundage was expired; yet make no
scruple to call that imposition the King's due: They affirm, that he had
sustained great and manifold losses by those who had defraud∣ed him
of this duty: And to provide a remedy, they vote him that supply dur∣ing his
life, and no longer. It is remarkable, that notwithstanding this last
clause, all his successors, for more than a century, continued in the
like irregular practice: If a practice may deserve that epithet, which all
the world acquiesced in, and which gave no offence. But when Charles the
first attempted to con∣tinue <PB N="283" REF="288"/> in the same course,
which had now received the sanction of many genera∣tions, so much were the
opinions of men altered, that a furious tempest was ex∣cited by it, and
historians, partial or ignorant, still represent that measure as a
most violent and unprecedented enormity in that unhappy prince.</P>
<P>THE foreign commerce of England, during this age, was mostly
confined to the Netherlands. The inhabitants of the Low Countries bought the
English commodities, and distributed them into the other parts of Europe.
Hence the mutual dependance of these countries on each other; and the great
loss sustained by both, in case of a rupture. During all the variations
of politics, the sove∣reigns always avoided the coming to this extremity; and
tho' the King bore a much greater friendship to Francis, the propensity of
the nation always lay to∣wards the emperor.</P>
<P>IN 1528, hostilities commenced between England and the Low
Countries; but were soon stopt by mutual agreement. While the Flemish
were not allowed to purchase cloth in England, the English merchants could
not buy it of the cloathiers, and the cloathiers were obliged to dismiss
their workmen, who began to be tumultuous for want of bread. The cardinal, to
appease them, sent for the merchants, and ordered them to buy cloth as
usual: They told him, that they could not dispose of it as usual; and
notwithstanding all his menaces, he could get no other answer from
them<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hall, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>olio 174.</NOTE>. An agreement was at last made to con∣tinue the
commerce between the states, even during war.</P>
<P>THE foreign artificers much surpassed the English in
dexterity, industry, and frugality; and hence the violent animosity, which
the latter, on many occasions, expressed against any of the former who
were settled in England. They had the assurance to complain, that all
their customers went to foreign tradesmen; and in the year 1517, being
moved by the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>editious sermons of
one Dr. Bele, and the intrigues of Lincoln, a broker, they raised an
insurrection. The appren∣tices, and others of the poorer sort, in London,
began by breaking up the pri∣sons, where some persons were confined for
insulting foreigners. They next pro∣ceeded to the house of Meutas, a
Frenchman, much hated by them; where they committed great disorders; killed
some of his servants, and plundered his goods. The mayor could not
appease them; nor Sir Thomas Moore, late under sheriff, tho' extremely
respected in the city. They also threatned cardinal Wolsey with some
insult; and he thought it necessary to fortify his house, and put
himself on his guard. Tired at last with these disorders, they
dispersed themselves; and the earls of Shrewsbury and Surrey seized
some of them. A proclamation was <PB N="284" REF="289"/> issued, that
women should not meet together to babble and talk, and that all men should
keep their wives in their houses. Next day the duke of Norfolk came into the
city, at the head of thirteen hundred armed men, and made enquiry into the
tumult. Be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e and Lincoln, and
several others, were sent to the Power, and condemned for treason.
Lincoln, and thirteen more were executed. The other persons, to the number of
four hundred, were brought before the King with ropes about their necks, fell
on their knees, and cried for mercy. Henry knew at that time to pardon; he
dismissed them all without further punish∣ment<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Stowe, 505. Hollingshed, 840.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>SO great was the number of foreign artizans in the city, that at
least fifteen thousand Flemish alone were at one time obliged to leave
it, by an order from the council, when Henry became jealous of their favour for
Queen Catherine<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Le Grand, vol. III. p.
232.</NOTE>. Henry himself confesses, in an edict of the star-chamber,
printed among the statutes, that the foreigners starved the natives; and
obliged them from idle∣ness to have recourse to theft, murder, and other
enormities<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">21 Hen. VIII.</NOTE>. He also
asserts, that the vast multitudes of the foreigners raised the price of
grain and bread<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. And to prevent the
increase of the evil, all foreign artificers were prohibited to have above
two foreigners in their house, either journeymen or apprentices. A like
jealoufy arose against the foreign merchants; and to comply with it, a law
was enacted obliging all denizons to pay the duties imposed upon aliens<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">22 Hen. VIII. c. 8.</NOTE>. The Parliament had done
better to have encouraged foreign merchants and artizans to come over to
England; which might have excited the emulation of the natives, and improved
their skill. The prisoners in the kingdom, for debts and crimes, are
asserted, in an act of parliament, to be sixty thousand persons and
above<NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">3 Hen. VIII. c. 15.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THERE is a remarkable clause in a statute passed near
the beginning of this reign<NOTE N="††" PLACE="foot">3 Hen. VIII.
c. 8.</NOTE>, by which we might be induced to believe, that England was
ex∣tremely decayed from the flourishing condition which it had attained in
former times. It had been enacted in the reign of Edward the second, that no
magi∣strate in town or borough, who by his office ought to keep assize,
should, dur∣ing the continuance of his magistracy, fell either in
wholesale or retail, any wine or victuals. This law seemed very equitable,
in order to prevent fraud or bye∣ends in fixing the assize: Yet the law is
repealed in this reign. The reason as∣signed is, that 
<Q REND="inline">"since the making of that statute and
ordinance, many and the most part of all the cities, boroughs, and towns
corporate, within the realm of England, are fallen in ruin and decay, and are
not inhabited by merchants, <PB N="285" REF="290"/> and men of such
substance as at the time of making that statute: For at this day, the
dwellers and inhabitants of the same cities and boroughs are commonly bakers,
vintners, fishmongers, and other victualers, and there remain few others to
bear the offices."</Q> Men have such a propensity to exalt past times
beyond the present, that it seems dangerous to credit this reasoning of
the Parlia∣ment, without further evidence to support it. So different are the
views in which the same object appears, that some may be inclined to draw
an opposite inference from this fact. A more regular police was established
in the reign of Henry the eighth, and a stricter administration of
justice; and advantage which induced the men of property to leave the
provincial towns, and to retire into the country. Cardinal Wolsey, in a
speech to the Parliament, represented it as a proof of the increase of
riches, that the customs had increased beyond what they were for∣merly<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hall, folio 110.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT if there was really a decay of commerce and industry, and
population in England, the statutes of this reign, except by abolishing
monasteries, and re∣trenching holidays, a circumstance of considerable
moment, were not in other respects well calculated to revive them. The fixing
the wages of artificers was attempted<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">6 Hen.
VIII. c. 3.</NOTE>: Luxury in apparel was prohibited, by repeated
statutes<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">1 Hen. VIII. c. 14. 6 Hen. VIII. c.
1. 7 Hen. VIII. c. 7.</NOTE>; and probably without success. The chancellor
and other ministers were empowered to fix the price of poultry, cheese, and
butter<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">25 Hen. VIII. c. 2.</NOTE>. A statute
was even passed to fix the price of beef, pork, mutton, and veal<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">24 Hen. VIII. c. 3.</NOTE>. Beef and pork were ordered
to be sold at a halfpenny a pound: Mutton and veal at a halfpenny half a
far∣thing. The preamble of the statute says, that these four species of
butcher's meat were the food of the poorer sort. This act was afterwards
repealed<NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">33 Hen. VIII. c. 11.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE practice of depopulating the country, by abandoning tillage,
and throw∣ing the lands into pasturage, still continued<NOTE N="††" PLACE="foot">Strype, vol. I. p. 392.</NOTE>; as appears by
the new laws which were enacted against that practice. The King was entitled
to half the rents of the land, where any farm houses were allowed to go to
decay<NOTE N="‡‡" PLACE="foot">6 Hen. VIII. c. 5. 7 Hen. VIII. c.
1.</NOTE>. The unskilful husbandry was probably the cause why the
proprietors found no profit in tillage. The number of sheep allowed to be
kept in one flock, was restrained to two thousand<NOTE N="‖‖" PLACE="foot">25 Hen. VIII. c. 13.</NOTE>. Sometimes, says the statute, one
proprietor or farmer would keep a flock of twenty-four thousand. It is
remarkable, that the Parliament ascribes the increasing price of sheep
and mutton, to this increase of sheep: Be∣cause, say they, the
commodity being got into few hands, the price of it is raised 
<PB N="286" REF="291"/> at pleasure<NOTE N="§§" PLACE="foot">25 Hen.
VIII. c. 13.</NOTE>. It is probable, that the effect proceeded from the daily
increase of money: For it is impossible, that such a commodity could be
monopolized. Interest was fixed during this reign at ten per cent<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">37 Hen. VIII. c 9.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>SOME laws were made with regard to beggars and vagabonds<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">22 Hen. VIII. c. 12. 22 Hen. VIII. c. 5.</NOTE>; one
of the circumstances in government, which humanity would most powerfully
recom∣mend to a benevolent legislator; which seems, at first fight, the
most easily ad∣justed; and which is yet the most difficult to settle
in such a manner, as to at∣tain the end without destroying industry. The
convents formerly were a support to the poor; but at the same
time▪tended to encourage idleness and beggary.</P>
<P>HENRY, as he possessed himself some talents for
letters, was an encourager of them in others. He founded Trinity college in
Cambridge, and gave it very ample endowments. Wolsey founded Christ Church
in Oxford, and intended to call it Cardinal college: But upon his fall, which
happened before he had en∣tirely finished his scheme, the King seized all
the revenues; and this violence, above all the other misfortunes of that great
minister, is said to have given him the greatest anxiety and concern<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Strype, vol. I. p. 117.</NOTE>. But Henry afterwards
restored the revenues of the college, and only changed the name. The cardinal
founded in Oxford the first chair for teaching Greek; and this novelty rent
that university into the most violent factions, which frequently came to
blows. The whole students di∣vided themselves into parties, which bore the
names of Greeks and Trojans, and sometimes fought with as great animosity
as was formerly exercised by those hostile nations. The rise of the
Greek language in Oxford, excited the emulation of Cambridge<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Wood's hist. &amp; ant. Oxon. lib. I. p. 245.</NOTE>. Wolsey
intended to have enriched the library of his college at Oxford, with copies of
all the manuscripts that were in the Vatican<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Ibid. 249.</NOTE>. The counte∣nance given to letters by this King
and his ministers, contributed to render learning fashionable in England;
and Erasmus speaks with great satisfaction of the gene∣ral regard paid by
the nobility and gentry of that kingdom to men of know∣ledge<NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">Epist. ad Banisium Also epist. p. 368.</NOTE>. It is
needless to be particular in mentioning the writers of this reign, or of the
preceding. There is no man in that age, who had the least pretension to be
ranked among our classics. Sir Thomas More, tho' he wrote in Latin, seems
to come the nearest to that character.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">State of the regency.</NOTE> THE late King,
by the regulations, which he imposed on the govern∣ment of his infant son,
as well as by the limitations of the succession, had projected to reign
even after his decease; and he imagined, that his ministers, who had always
been so obsequious to him during his life-time, would never afterwards
depart from the plan, which he had traced out to them. He fixed the majority of
the Prince at the completion of his eigh∣teenth year; and as Edward was at
present only a few months past nine, he ap∣pointed sixteen executors; to
whom, during the minority, he entrusted the go∣vernment <PB N="288" REF="293"/> of the King and kingdom. Their names were, Cranmer, archbishop of
Canterbury; lord Wriothesley, chancellor; lord St. John, great master; lord
Russel, privy seal; the earl of Hertford, chamberlain; viscount
Lisle, admiral; Tonstal, bishop of Durham; Sir Anthony Brown, master of
horse; Sir William Paget, secretary of state; Sir Edward North,
chancellor of the court of aug∣mentations; Sir Edward Montague, chief justice
of the common pleas; judge Bromley, Sir Anthony Denny, and Sir William Herbert,
chief gentlemen of the privy chamber; Sir Edward Wotton, treasurer of Calais;
Dr. Wotton, dean of Canterbury. To these sixteen executors, with whom was
entrusted the whole regal authority, were added twelve counsellors, who
possessed no immediate power, and could only assist with their
advice, when any affair was laid before them. The council was composed of the
earls of Arundel and Essex; Sir Thomas Cheyney, treasurer of the
household; Sir John Gage, comptroller; Sir Anthony Wingfield, vice
chamberlain; Sir William Petre, secretary of state; Sir Richard Rich, Sir
John Baker, Sir Ralph Sadler, Sir Thomas Seymour, Sir Richard Southwel, and Sir
Edmund Peckham<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Strype's Memor. vol. ii. p. 457.</NOTE>.
The usual caprice of Henry appears somewhat in this nomination; while he
appointed several persons of inferior sta∣tion among his executors, and
gave only the place of counsellor to a person of such high rank as the
earl of Arundel, and to Sir Thomas Seymour, the King's uncle.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Innovations in the regency.</NOTE> BUT the
first act of the executors and counsellors was to depart from the
destination of the late King in a material article. No sooner were they
met, than it was suggested, that the government would lose its dignity,
for want of some head, who might represent the royal majesty, who might
receive addresses from foreign ambassadors, to whom dispatches from
English ministers abroad might be carried, and whose name might be
employed in all orders and proclamations: And as the King's will seemed to
contain a defect in this particular, it was concluded ne∣cessary to
supply it, by choosing a protector; who, tho' he should possess all
the exterior symbols of royal dignity, should yet be bound, in every
exercise of power, to follow the opinion of the executors<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. ii. p. 5.</NOTE>. This proposal was very
disagreeable to chancellor Wriothesely. That magistrate, a man of an
active spirit and high ambition, found himself, by his office, entitled to
the first rank in the regency after the primate; and as he knew, that that
prelate had no talent nor inclination for state affairs, he hoped, that the
direction of public business would of course devolve in a great measure
upon himself. He opposed, therefore, this proposal of choosing a
protector; and represented that innovation as an infringe∣ment of the King's
will, which, being corroborated by act of parliament, ought 
<PB N="289" REF="294"/> in every thing to be a law to them, and could not be
altered but by the same authority, which had established it. The
executors and counsellors were mostly courtiers, who had been raised by
Henry's favour, not men of high birth or great dependances; and as they had
been sufficiently accustomed to submission during the reign of the
late monarch, and had no pretensions to govern the na∣tion by their own
authority, they acquiesced the more willingly in a proposal, which seemed
calculated for preserving public peace and tranquillity. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Somerset pro∣tector.</NOTE> It being
therefore agreed to name a protector, the choice fell of course on the earl
of Hartford, who, as he was the King's maternal uncle, was strongly
interested in his safety; and having no pretensions to inherit the crown,
could never have any separate interest, which might engage him to endanger
Edward's person or his authority<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Heylin, Hist. Ref.
Edw. VI.</NOTE>. The public were informed by proclamation of this change in the
administration; and dispatches were sent to all foreign courts to give
them intimation of it. All those possessed of any office resigned
their former commis∣sions, and took out new ones in the name of the young
King. The bishops themselves were constrained to make a like
submission. Care was taken to insert in their new commissions, that
they held their office during pleasure<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Collier, vol. ii. p. 218. Burnet, vol. ii. p. 6. Strype's Mem. of
Cranm. p. 141.</NOTE>: And it is there expressly affirmed, that all manner of
authority and jurisdiction, as well ecclesiast cal as civil, is
originally derived from the crown<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Strype's
Memor. of Cranm. p. 141.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE executors showed, in their next measure, a more
submissive deference to Henry's will; because many of them found their
own account in it. The late King had intended, before his death, to make a new
creation of nobility, in or∣der to supply the place of those who had fallen
by former attainders, or the fai∣lure of issue; and that he might enable
the persons to support their new dig∣nity, he had resolved either to
bestow estates on them, or advance them to higher offices. He had even gone
so far as to inform them of this resolution; and in his will, he charged
his executors to make good all his promises<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Fuller, Heylin, and Rymer.</NOTE>. That they might ascertain his
intentions in the most authentic manner, Sir William Paget, Sir Anthony
Denny, and Sir William Herbert, with whom Henry had always conversed in a
familiar manner, were called before the board of regency; and having given
evidence of what they knew concerning the King's promises, their testimony
was relied on, and the executors proceeded to the fulfilling these
en∣gagements. Hartford was created duke of Somerset, marschal and lord
trea∣surer; 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">17th of Fe∣bruary.</NOTE> Wriothesely, earl
of Southampton; the earl of Essex, marquess of Nor∣thampton; viscount
Lisle, earl of Warwick; Sir Thomas Seymour, lord Sey∣mour of Sudley, and
admiral: Sir Richard Rich, Sir William Willoughby, Sir <PB N="290" REF="295"/>
Edward Sheffield, accepted the title of baron<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Stow's
Annals, p. 594.</NOTE>: Several, to whom the same dignity was offered,
refused it; because the other part of the King's promise, the bestowing
estates on these new noblemen, was deferred till a more convenient
op∣portunity. Some of them, however, particularly Somerset the protector,
were, in the mean time, endowed with spiritual preferments, deanories and
preben∣daries. For among many other invasions of ecclesiastical
privileges and properties, this irregular practice, of bestowing spiritual
benefices on laymen, began now to prevail.</P>
<P>THE earl of Southampton had always been engaged in an opposite
party to Somerset; and it was not likely that factions, which had secretly
prevailed, even during the arbitrary reign of Henry, should be
suppressed in the weak administra∣tion, which usually attends a
minority. The former nobleman, that he might have the greater leisure for
attending to state-affairs, had, of himself and from his own authority, put
the great seal in commission, and had empowered four lawyers, Southwel,
Tregonel, Oliver, and Bellasis, to execute in his absence the office of
chancellor. This measure seems very exceptionable; and the more so, that
two of the commissioners being canonists, the lawyers suspected,
that, by this nomination, the chancellor had intended to discredit the common
law. Com∣plaints were made to the council; who, influenced by the protector,
gladly laid hold of this opportunity to depress Southampton. They consulted
the judges with regard to so unusual a case, and received for answer,
that the commission was illegal, and that the chancellor, by his
presumption in granting it, had justly forfeited the seals, and was even
liable to punishment. The council summoned him to appear before them; and
tho' he maintained, that he held his office by the late King's will, founded on
an act of parliament, and could not lose it with∣out a trial before the
Parliament; that if the commission, which he had granted, was found
illegal, it might be declared null and void, and all the ill consequences of
it be easily remedied; and that the depriving him of the seals for an error
of this nature, was a precedent by which any other innovation might be
authorized; the council, notwithstanding all these topics of defence,
declared that he had forfeited his office; that a fine should be imposed
upon him; and that he should be confined to his own house during
pleasure<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Hollingshed, p. 979.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THO' the removal of Southampton encreased the protector's
authority, and tended to suppress factions in the regency; yet was not
Somerset contented with this advantage: His ambition carried him to seek
still farther acquisitions. Un∣der pretence, that the vote of the
executors, choosing him protector, was not a suffi∣cient 
<PB N="291" REF="296"/> foundation for his authority, he procured a patent from
the young King, by which he entirely overturned the will of Harry the eighth,
produced a total revolution in the government, and may seem even to have
subverted all the laws of the kingdom. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">12 March.</NOTE> He named himself protector
with full regal power, and appointed a council, consisting of all the
former counsellors, and all the execu∣tors except Southampton: He reserved
a power of naming any other counsellors at pleasure: And he was bound to
consult with such only as he thought proper. The protector and his council
were likewise empowered to act at discretion, and to execute whatever they
thought serviceable to the government, without incur∣ring any penalty or
forfeiture from any law, statute, proclamation, or ordinance
whatsoever<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. ii. Records, No. 6.</NOTE>.
Even had this patent been less exorbitant in its concessions, and had it
been drawn by directions from the executors appointed by Henry, its le∣gality
might justly be questioned; since it seems essential to a trust
of this na∣ture to be exercised by the persons entrusted, nor can it be
delegated to others: But as the patent, by its very tenor, where the executors
are not so much as mentioned, appears to have been surreptitiously
obtained from a minor King, the protectorship of Somerset was a plain
usurpation, which it is impossible by any ar∣guments to justify. The
connivance, however, of the executors, and their pre∣sent acquiescence in
the new establishment, made it be universally submitted to; and as the
young King discovered an extreme attachment to his uncle, who was also in
the main a man of moderation and probity, no objections were made to his power
and title. All men of sense, likewise, as they saw the nation divided
by the religious zeal of the opposite sects, thought it the more
necessary to entrust the government to one person, who might check the
exorbitancies of party, and ensure the public tranquillity. And tho' some
clauses of the patent seemed to imply a formal subversion of all
liberty or limited government, so little jealousy was then usually
entertained on that head, that no exception was ever taken at bare claims or
pretensions of this nature, advanced by any person, pos∣sessed of
sovereign power. The actual exercise alone of arbitrary administration,
and that in many and great and flagrant and unpopular instances, was able
some∣times to give some umbrage to the nation.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Reformation compleated.</NOTE> THE
extensive authority and imperious character of Henry, had retained the
par∣tizans of both religions in subjection; but upon his decease, the hopes
of the protes∣tants and the fears of the catholics began to revive, and the
zeal of these parties pro∣duced every where disputes and animosities, the
usual preludes of more fatal divisions. The protector had long been
regarded as the secret partizan of the reformers; and being now freed from
restraint, he scrupled not to express his intention of 
<PB N="292" REF="297"/> correcting all the abuses of the antient religion, and
of adopting still more of the protestant innovations. He took care, that
all the persons, to whom he entrusted the King's education, should be
attached to the same principles▪ and as the young Prince discovered a
zeal for every kind of literature, especially the theological, far beyond his
tender years, all men foresaw, in the course of his reign, the total
abo∣lition of the catholic faith; and they early began to declare themselves
in favour of those tenets, which were likely to become in the end entirely
prevalent. Af∣ter Southampton's fall, few members of the council seemed to
retain any attach∣ment to the Romish communion; and most of the
counsellors appeared even sanguine in forwarding the progress of the
reformation. The riches which most of them had acquired from the spoils of
the clergy, induced them to widen the breach between England and Rome; and by
establishing a contra∣riety of speculative tenets, as well as of
discipline and worship, to render a coali∣tion with the mother church
altogether impracticable<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Goodwin's Annals,
Heylin.</NOTE>. Their rapacity also, the chief source of their reforming
spirit, was excited by the prospect of pillaging the secular, as they had
already done the regular clergy; and they knew, that, while any share of the
old principles remained, or any regard to the ecclesiastics, they never
could hope to succeed in their pretensions.</P>
<P>THE numerous and burthensome superstitions, with which the
Romish church was loaded, had thrown many of the reformers, by the spirit
of opposition, into an enthusiastic strain of devotion; and all rites,
ceremonies, pomp, order, and exterior observances were zealously
abolished by them, as hindrances of their spi∣ritual contemplation, and
obstructions to their immediate converse with heaven. Many circumstances
concurred to enflame this daring spirit; the novelty itself of their
doctrines, the triumph of making proselytes, the furious persecutions to
which they were exposed, their animosity against the antient tenets and
practices, and the necessity of procuring the concurrence of the laity, by
depressing the hier∣archy, and by tendering to them the plunder of the
ecclesiastics. Wherever the re∣formation prevailed over the opposition of
civil authority, this genius of religion appeared in its full extent, and was
attended with consequences, which, tho' less durable, were, for some
time, no less dangerous than those which were con∣nected with the antient
superstition. But as the magistrate took the lead in Eng∣land, the
transition was more gradual; much of the antient religion was still
pre∣served; and a reasonable degree of subordination was retained in
discipline, as well as some pomp, order, and ceremony in public
worship.</P>
<P>THE protector, in his schemes for advancing the reformation,
had always recourse to the councils of Cranmer, who, being a man of
moderation and pru∣dence, <PB N="293" REF="298"/> was averse to all violent
changes, and was determined to bring over the people, by insensible
innovations, to that system of doctrine and discipline, which he
esteemed the most pure and perfect. He probably also foresaw, that a
system, which carefully avoided the extremes of reformation, was likely to
be most last∣ing; and that a devotion, merely spiritual, was fitted only
for the first fervours of a new sect, and upon the relaxation of these
naturally gave place to the inroads of superstition. He seems therefore
to have intended the establishment of a hierarchy, which, being suited to
a great and settled government, might stand as a perpetual barrier
against Rome, and might retain the reverence of the people, even after their
enthusiastic zeal was diminished or entirely evaporated.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Gardiner's opposition.</NOTE> THE person,
who opposed, with greatest authority, any farther advances towards
reformation, was Gardiner, bishop of Winchester; who, tho' he had not
ob∣tained a place in the counsel of regency, on account of some late
disgusts, which he had given to Henry, was entitled, by his age,
experience, and capacity, to the highest trust and confidence of his party.
This prelate continued still to magnify the great wisdom and learning of
the late King, which were generally and sincerely admired by the nation; and
he insisted on the prudence of perse∣vering, at least till the young
King's majority, in the ecclesiastical model, esta∣blished by that
great monarch. He defended the use of images, which were now very openly
attacked by the protestants; and he represented them as serviceable in
maintaining a sense of religion among the illiterate multitude<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Fox, vol. ii. p. 712.</NOTE>. He even deigned to write an apology
for <HI>holy water,</HI> which bishop Ridley had decried in a sermon; and
he maintained, that, by the power of the Almighty, it might be rendered an
instrument of doing good; as much as the shadow of St. Peter, the hem of
our Saviour's garment, or the spittle and clay laid upon the eyes of the
blind<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Fox, vol. ii. p. 724.</NOTE>. Above all,
he insisted, that the laws ought to be observed, that the constitution
ought to be preserved inviolate, and that it was dangerous to follow the will
of the sovereign, in opposition to an act of parliament<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Collier, vol. ii. p. 228. Fox, vol. ii.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT tho' there remained at that time in England an idea of laws
and a consti∣tution, sufficient at least to furnish a topic of argument
to such as were discon∣tented with the present exercise of authority;
this plea could scarcely, in the present case, be maintained with any
plausibility by Gardiner. An act of par∣liament had invested the crown with
a legislative power; and royal proclama∣tions, even during a minority, were
armed with the force and authority of laws. The protector, finding himself
supported by this statute, was determined to em∣ploy his influence in
favour of the reformers; and having suspended, during the interval, the
authority of the bishops, he appointed a general visitation to be 
<PB N="294" REF="299"/> made in all the dioceses of England<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mem. Cranm. p. 146, 147, &amp;c.</NOTE>. The visitors
consisted of a mixture of clergy and laity, and had six circuits
assigned them. The chief purpose of their instructions was, besides
correcting immoralities and irregularities in the clergy, to abolish the
antient superstitions, and to bring the discipline and worship
some∣what nearer the practice of the reformed churches. The moderation of
Somerset and Cranmer is apparent in the conduct of this delicate affair. The
visitors were enjoined to retain for the present all images which had not
been abused to idolatry; and to instruct the people not to despise
such ceremonies as were not yet abrogated, but only to beware of some
particular superstitions, such as the sprinkling their beds with holy
water, the ringing of bells, or using of blessed candles, in order to
drive away the devil<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. ii. p.
28.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT nothing required more the correcting hand of authority, than
the abuse of preaching, which was now generally employed, throughout England,
in de∣fending the antient practices and superstitions. The court of
augmentations, in order to ease the King of the annuities paid to monks, had
commonly placed them in the vacant churches; and these men were led by
interest, as well as in∣clination, to support those principles, which had
been invented for the profit of the clergy. Orders therefore were given to
restrain the topics of their sermons: Twelve homilies were published,
which they were enjoined to read to the people: And all of them were
prohibited, without express permission, to preach any where but in their
parish churches. The design of this injunction was to throw a restraint
on the catholic divines; while the protestant, by the grant of particu∣lar
licences, should be allowed unbounded liberty.</P>
<P>BONNER made some opposition to these measures; but
soon after retracted and acquiesced. Gardiner was more high-spirited and
more steddy. He repre∣sented the peril of perpetual innovations, and the
necessity of adhering to some system. 
<Q REND="inline">"'Tis a dangerous thing," said he, "to use
too much freedom, in researches of this kind. If you cut the old canal, the
water is apt to run fur∣ther than you have a mind to. If you indulge the humour
of novelty, you cannot put a stop to people's demands, nor govern their
indiscretions at plea∣sure. For my part," said he, on another occasion,
"my sole concern is to manage the third and last act of my life with
decency, and to make a hand∣some exit off the stage. Provided this point is
secured, I am not sollicitous about the rest. I am already by nature
condemned to death: No man can give me a pardon from this sentence; nor so
much as procure me a reprieve. To speak my mind, and to act as my
conscience directs, are two branches of liberty, which I can never part with.
Sincerity in speech, and integrity in <PB N="295" REF="300"/> action, are
entertaining qualities: They will stick by a man, when every thing else
takes its leave; and I must not resign them upon any consideration. The
best on it is, if I do not throw them away myself, no man can force them
from me: But if I give them up, then am I ruined by myself, and deserve to
lose all my preferments<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Collier, vol. II. p. 228. ex
MS. Col. C. C. Cantab. Bibliothica Brittanica, article Gardiner.</NOTE>.</Q>
This opposition of Gardiner drew on him the in∣dignation of the council; and
he was sent to the Fleet, where he was used with some harshness and
severity.</P>
<P>ONE of the chief objections, urged by Gardiner against the new
homilies, was that they defined with the most metaphysical precision the
doctrine of grace, and of justification by faith; points, he thought, which
it was superfluous for any man to know exactly, and which certainly exceeded
much the comprehension of the vulgar. A famous martyrologist calls
Gardiner, on account of this opinion, 
<Q REND="inline">"an insensible ass, and one that had no
feeling of God's spirit in the matter of justification<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Fox, vol. II.</NOTE>."</Q> The meanest protestant imagined at
that time, that he had a full comprehension of all those mysterious
doctrines, and he heartily despised the most learned and knowing person
of the antient religion. It is indeed certain, that the reformers were very
fortunate in their doctrine of justification, and might venture to promise
on its success, in opposition to all the ceremonies, shows, and
superstitions of popery. By exalting Christ and his sufferings, and
renounc∣ing all claim to independent merit in ourselves, it was calculated to
become po∣pular, and coincided with those principles of panegyric and of
self-abasement, which generally have place in religion.</P>
<P>TONSTAL, bishop of Durham, having, as well as Gardiner, made
some op∣position to the new regulations, was dismissed the
council-board; but no farther severity was, for the present, exercised
against him. He was a man of perfect moderation, and of the most
unexceptionable character in the kingdom.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Foreign af∣fairs.</NOTE> THE same religious
zeal which engaged Somerset to promote the reformation at home, led him to
carry his attention to foreign countries; where the interests of the
protestants were now exposed to the most imminent danger. The Roman
pontiff, with much reluctance and after long delays, had at last summoned a
ge∣neral council, which was assembled at Trent, and was employed in
correcting the abuses of the church, and in ascertaining her doctrines. The
emperor, who de∣sired to repress the power of the court of Rome, as well as
gain over the prote∣stants, promoted the former object of the council; the
pope, who found his own greatness so deeply interested, desired rather
to employ them in the latter. He <PB N="296" REF="301"/> gave instructions to
his legates, who presided in the council, to protract the de∣bates, and to
engage the theologians in altercations, and arguments, and disputes
concerning the nice points of faith, canvassed before them: A policy, which
was so easy to be executed, that the legates found it rather necessary
to interpose, in order to appease the animosity of the divines, and bring
them at last to some de∣cision<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Father
Paul, lib. 2.</NOTE>. The more difficult task for the legates was to moderate
or divert the zeal of the council for reformation, and to repress the
ambition of the prelates, who desired to exalt the episcopal authority on
the ruins of the sovereign pontiff. Finding this humour become intractable,
the legates, under pretence that the plague had broke out at Trent, transferred
of a sudden the council to Bologna, where, they hoped, it would be more under
the direction of his holiness.</P>
<P>THE emperor, no less than the pope, had learned to make
religion subservient to his ambition and policy. He was resolved to
employ the imputation of heresy as a pretence for subduing the protestant
princes, and oppressing the liberties of Germany; but found it requisite
to cover his intentions under a deep artifice, and to prevent the combination
of his adversaries. He separated the Palatine and the elector of
Brandenburgh from the protestant confederacy: He took arms against the
elector of Saxony, and the landgrave of Hesse: By the fortune of war he
made the former prisoner: He employed treachery and prevarication against
the latter, and detained him captive, by breaking a safe-conduct which he had
granted him. He seemed to have reached the summit of his ambition; and the
German princes, who were astonished with his success, were farther
dis∣couraged by the intelligence, which they had received, of the death
first of Henry the eighth, then of Francis the first, their usual
resources in every ca∣lamity<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sleidan.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>HENRY the second, who succeeded to the crown of France, was
a prince of vigour and ability; but less prompt in his resolutions than
Francis, and less en∣flamed with rivalship and animosity against the
emperor, Charles. Tho' he sent ambassadors to the princes of the
Smalcaldic League, and promised them his protection, he was unwilling, in the
commencement of his reign, to hurry into a war against so great a power as
that of the emperor, and he thought that the alliance of these princes was a
sure resource, which he could at any time lay hold of<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Pere Daniel.</NOTE>. He was much governed by the duke of Guise
and the cardinal of Lorraine, brothers to the Queen dowager of Scotland, and he
hearkened to their counsel, in chusing rather to give immediate
assistance to that antient ally, which, even before the death of Henry
the eighth, had loudly claimed the protection of the French monarchy.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">Progress of the Reforma∣tion in
Scot∣land.</NOTE> THE hatred between the two factions, the partizans of the
antient and those of the new religion, became every day more violent in
Scotland; and the reso∣lution, which the cardinal primate had taken to employ
the most rigorous punish∣ments against the reformers, brought matters to
a quick decision. There was one Wishart, a gentleman by birth, who employed
himself with great zeal in preach∣ing against the antient
superstitions, and began to give alarm to the clergy, who were justly
terrified with the danger of some fatal revolution in religion. This man was
much celebrated for the purity of his morals, and for his extensive learning:
But these praises cannot be much depended on; because, we know, that,
among the reformers, severity of manners stood in place of many virtues;
and the age was in general so ignorant, that most of the priests in
Scotland imagined the New Testament to be a composition of Luther's, and
asserted that the Old alone was the word of God<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Spotswood, p. 75. The same author, p. 92, tells us a story,
which confirms this character of the popish clergy in Scotland. It became a
great dispute in the university of St. Andrews, whether the <HI>pater</HI>
should be said to God or the saints. The friars, who knew in general that
the reformers neglected the saints, were determined to maintain their honour
with great obstinacy, but they knew not upon what topics to found their
doctrine. Some held that the <HI>pater</HI> was said to God
<HI>formaliter,</HI> and to saints <HI>mate∣rialiter;</HI> others, to God
<HI>principaliter,</HI> and to saints <HI>minus principaliter;</HI> others
would have it <HI>ultimate</HI> and <HI>non ultimate:</HI> But the majority
seemed to hold, that the <HI>pater</HI> was said to God <HI>capiendo
stricte,</HI> and to saints <HI>capiendo large.</HI> A simple fellow, who
served the sub-prior, thinking there was some great matter in hand, that
made the doctors hold so many conferences together, asked him one day what
the matter was; the sub-prior answering, <HI>Tom,</HI> that was the
fellow's name, <HI>we cannot agree to whom the pater-noster should be
said.</HI> He suddenly replied, <HI>To whom, Sir, should it be said,
but unto God?</HI> Then said the sub-prior, <HI>what shall we do with the
saints?</HI> He answered, <HI>Give them Aves and Creeds enow in the devil's
name; for that may suffice them.</HI> The answer going abroad, many said,
<HI>that he had given a wiser decision than all the doctors had done with
all their distinctions.</HI></NOTE>. But however the case may have been
with regard to those estimable qualities ascribed to Wishart, he was
strongly possessed with a desire of innovation; and he enjoyed
those talents, which qualified him for be∣coming a popular preacher, and for
seizing the attention and affections of the multitude. The magistrates of
Dundee, where he exercised his mission, were alarmed with his progress;
and being unable or unwilling to treat him with rigour, they contented
themselves with denying him the liberty of preaching, and with
dismissing him the bounds of their jurisdiction. Wishart, moved with
indig∣nation, that they had dared to reject the word of God, menaced them, in
imita∣tion of the antient prophets, with some imminent calamity; and he
withdrew to the west country, where he daily increased the number of his
proselytes. Mean∣while, a plague broke out in Dundee; and all men exclaimed,
that the town had drawn down the vengeance of Heaven by banishing the pious
preacher, and that the pestilence would never cease till they had made him
attonement for their <PB N="298" REF="303"/> offence against him. No sooner
did Wishart hear of this change in their dis∣position, than he returned
to them, and made them a new tender of his doctrine: But lest he should
spread the contagion by bringing multitudes together, he erected his pulpit
on the top of a gate: The infected stood within; the others without. And the
preacher failed not▪ in such a situation, to take advantage of the
immediate terrors of the people, and to enforce his evangelical
mission<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Knox's Hist. of Ref. p. 44.
Spotswood.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE assiduity and success of Wishart became an object
of attention to cardinal Beaton; and he resolved, by the punishment of so
celebrated a preacher, to strike a terror into all other innovators. He
engaged the earl of Bothwel to arrest him in his retirement; and to deliver
him into his hands, contrary to a promise given by Bothwel to that unhappy
man: And being possessed of his prey, he conducted him to St. Andrew's
where, after a trial, he condemned him to the flames for heresy. Arran, the
regent, was very irresolute in his temper; and the cardinal, tho' he had
gained him to his party, found, that he would not concur in the condemnation
and execution of Wishart. He was therefore determined, without the
assistance of the secular arm, to bring that heretic to punishment;
and he himself beheld from his windows the dismal spectacle▪
Wishart suffered with the usual patience; but could not forbear remarking
the triumph of his insulting enemy. He foretold, that in a few days he would
in the very same place lie as low, as now he was exalted aloft, in
opposition to true piety and religion<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Spotswood, Buchanan.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THIS prophesy was probably the immediate cause of the event
which it foretold▪ 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Assassination of cardinal
Beaton.</NOTE> The disciples of this martyr, enraged at the cruel execution,
formed a conspiracy against the cardinal; and having associated to them
Norman Lesly, who was disgusted on account of some private quarrel,
they conducted their enterprize with great secrecy and success. Early in
the morning they entered the cardinal's palace, which he had strongly
fortified; and though they were not above sixteen persons, they thrust
out an hundred tradesmen and fifty servants, whom they seized
separately, before any suspicion arose of their intentions; and having
shut the gates, they proceeded very deliberately to execute their purpose
on the car∣dinal. That prelate had been alarmed with the noise which he heard
in the castle; and had barricadoe'd the door of his chamber: But finding that
they had brought fire in order to force their way, and having obtained, as is
believed, a promise of life, he opened the door; and reminding them, that he
was a priest, be conjured them to spare him. Two of the assassins
rushed upon him with drawn swords; but a third, James Melvil, more calm and
more considerate in <PB N="299" REF="304"/> villany, stopped their carreer,
and reminded them, that this sacrifice was the work and judgment of God, and
ought to be executed with the utmost reflection and gravity. Then turning the
point of his sword towards Beaton, he called to him, 
<Q REND="inline">"Repent thee, thou wicked cardinal, of all thy
sins and iniquities, but especially of the murder of Wishart, that
instrument of God for the con∣version of these lands: It is his death,
which now cries vengeance upon thee: We are sent by God to inflict the
deserved punishment. For here, before the Almighty, I protest, that it is
neither hatred of thy person, nor love of thy riches, nor fear of thy power,
which moves me to seek thy death: But only because thou hast been, and
still remainest, an obstinate enemy to Christ Jesus, and his holy
gospel."</Q> Having spoke these words, without giving him leisure to
finish that repentance, to which he exhorted him, he thrust him thro' the
body; and the cardinal fell dead at his feet<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The famous
Scotch reformer, John Knox, calls James Melvil, p. 65, a man most gentle and
most modest. It is very horrid, but at the same time somewhat amazing,
to consider the joy and alacrity and pleasure, which that historian
discovers in his narration of this assassination: And it is
remark∣able that in the first edition of his work, these words were printed
on the margin of the page, <HI>The godly Fact and Words of James M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lvil.</HI> But the following editors
retrenched them. Knox himself had no hand in the murder of Beaton; but he
afterwards joined the assassins, and assi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>led them in holding out the castle. See Keith's
Hist. of the Ref. of Scotland, p. 13.</NOTE>. This murther was executed on
the 28th of May 1546. The assassins being reinforced by their friends
to the num∣ber of an hundred and forty persons, prepared themselves for the
defence of the castle, and sent a messenger to London, craving
assistance from Henry. That prince, tho' Scotland was comprehended in his
peace with France, would not re∣ject this opportunity of disturbing the
government of that kingdom; and he agreed to take them under his
protection.</P>
<P>IT was the peculiar misfortune of Scotland, that five short
reigns had been successively followed by as many long minorities; and the
execution of justice, which the prince was beginning to introduce, had been
continually interrupted by the cabals, factions, and animosities of the
great. But besides these invete∣rate and antient evils, a new source of
disorder had arisen, the disputes and con∣tentions of theology, which
were sufficient to disturb the most settled govern∣ment; and the death
of the cardinal, who was possessed of ability and vigour, seemed much
to weaken the hands of the administration. But the Queen dow∣ager was a woman
of uncommon talents and virtues; and she did as much to support the
government, and supply the weakness of Arran, the governor, as could be
expected in her situation. A stipulation was made with the garrison of
St. Andrews, that they should surrender the castle upon receiving a
pardon, to∣gether with an absolution from the pope; and that they should
never afterwards <PB N="300" REF="305"/> be called in question for Beaton's
assassination. Meanwhile, till the pope's abso∣lution should
arrive, she applied to France for succours; and Henry sent her some
gallies, with a train of artillery, commanded by Strozzi, prior of Capua.
Be∣fore the siege of St. Andrews was opened, the absolution was sent to
the garrison, and they were required to surrender; but because the pope,
among other exagge∣rations of the cardinal's murder, had said, that he
pardoned an unpardonable crime, the garrison, fearing that this
expression was employed in order to ensnare them, refused to open their
gates<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Knox, p. 75. Spotswood,
Buchanan.</NOTE>. They were, however, soon obliged to depart from their
obstinacy: A great breach was made in the walls: The plague broke out among
them: And seeing no hopes of succour from England, they surren∣dered to
the French upon conditions, which were not very scrupulously observed to
them.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Conduct of the war with Scotland.</NOTE> THE
protector of England, so soon as the government was brought to some
composure, made preparations for the attack of Scotland; and he was
determined to execute, if possible, that project, of uniting the two
kingdoms by marriage, on which the late King had been so intent, and which he
had recommended with his dying breath to his executors. He raised an army of
18000 men, and equipped a fleet of sixty sail, one half of which were
ships of war, the other loaded with provisions and ammunition. He gave the
command of the fleet to lord Clinton: He himself marched at the head of the
army, attended by the earl of Warwic. These hostile measures were covered
with a pretence of revenging some depredations committed by the borderers;
but besides, that the protector revived the antient claim of the
superiority of the English crown over that of Scotland, he refused to
enter into negotiation on any other conditions than the marriage of the young
Queen with Edward.</P>
<P>THE protector published a manifesto, in which he inforced
all the arguments for that measure. He said, that nature seemed
originally to have intended this island for one empire; and having cut it off
from all communication with foreign states, and guarded it by the ocean,
she had pointed out to the inhabitants the road to happiness and
security: That the education and customs of the people concurred with
nature; and by giving them the same language, and laws, and manners, had
invited them to a thorough union and coalition: That fortune had at last
removed all obstacles, and had prepared an expedient, by which they might
be∣come one people, without leaving any place for that jealousy either of
honour or of interest, to which rival nations are naturally so much
exposed: That the crown of Scotland had devolved to a female; that of England
to a male; and happily the two sovereigns, as of a rank, so were they
also of an age, the most suitable <PB N="301" REF="306"/> to each other:
That the hostile disposition, which prevailed between the nations, and
which arose from past injuries, would soon be extinguished, after a
long and secure peace had established confidence between them: That the
me∣mory of former miseries, which at present enflamed their mutual
animosity, would then serve only to make them cherish, with more
passion, a state of hap∣piness and tranquillity, so long unknown to
their ancestors: That when hostilities had ceased between the kingdoms,
the Scotch nobility, who were at present obliged to remain perpetually in a
warlike posture, would learn to cultivate the arts of peace, and would
soften their minds to a love of domestic order and obe∣dience: That as this
situation was desirable to both kingdoms, so particularly to Scotland,
which had been exposed to the greatest miseries from intestine and
fo∣reign wars, and saw herself every moment in danger of losing her
independency, by the efforts of a richer and more powerful people: That tho'
England had claims of superiority, she was willing to resign every
pretension for the sake of future peace, and desired an union, which
would be the more secure, as it would be concluded on terms entirely equal:
And that besides all these motives, positive engagements had been taken
for the compleating this alliance, and the honour and good faith of the nation
were pledged to fulfil what her interest and safety so loudly
demanded<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sir John Hayward in Kenneth, p. 279. Heylin,
p. 42.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>SOMERSET soon found, that these remonstrances would have
no influence; and that the Queen dowager's attachments to France and to the
catholic religion would render ineffectual all negotiations for the intended
marriage. He found himself therefore obliged to try the force of arms, and to
constrain the Scotch by necessity to submit to a measure, for which
they seemed to have entertained the most incurable aversion. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">2d September.</NOTE> He passed the borders
at Berwic, and advanced to∣wards Edinburgh, without meeting any resistance
for some days, except from some small castles, which were constrained
to surrender at discretion. The pro∣tector intended to have punished the
governor and garrison of one of those castles for their temerity in
resisting such unequal force: But they eluded his anger by asking only
a few hours respite till they should prepare themselves for death; after
which they found his ears more open to their applications for mercy<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Hayward, Patten.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE governor of Scotland had summoned together the whole force
of the kingdom; and his army, double the number of the English, had taken
post on very advantageous ground, guarded by the banks of the Eske, about
four miles from Edinburgh. The English came within sight of them at
Faside; and after a skirmish between the horse, where the Scotch were
worsted, and lord Hume dangerously wounded, Somerset prepared himself
for a more decisive action. But <PB N="302" REF="307"/> having taken a view of
the Scotch camp with the earl of Warwic, he found it difficult to make any
attempt upon it with a probability of success. He wrote therefore another
letter to Arran; and offered to retire out of the kingdom, as well as to repair
all damages which he had committed, provided that the Scotch would stipulate
not to contract the Queen to any foreign prince, but to keep her at home, till
she reached the age of choosing a husband for herself. Such mo∣derate
terms were rejected by the Scotch merely on account of their moderation; and
begot an opinion, that the protector must either be reduced to great
distress or be influenced by fear, that he was now contented to abate so
much of his former pretensions. Actuated also by their priests, who had
come to the camp in great numbers, they believed, that the English were
detestable heretics, abhorred of God, and exposed to divine vengeance; and
that no success could ever crown their arms. They were confirmed in this
fond conceit, when they saw the pro∣tector change his ground, and move
towards the sea; nor did they any longer doubt that he intended to embark his
army, and make his escape on board the ships, which at that very time moved
into the bay, opposite to him<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hollingshed, p.
985.</NOTE>. Deter∣mined therefore to cut off his retreat, they quitted their
camp; 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">10th Septem∣ber.</NOTE> and passing the
river Eske, advanced into the plain. They were divided into three bodies:
Angus commanded the vanguard; Arran the main body; Huntley the rear: Their
cavalry consisted only of light horse, which were placed on their left
flank, strengthened by some Irish archers, whom Argyle had brought over
for this service.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The battle of Pinkey.</NOTE> SOMERSET was
pleased when he saw this movement of the Scotch army; and as the English
had usually been superior in pitched battles, he conceived great hopes of
success. He arranged his van on his left, farthest from the sea; and
ordered them to remain on the high grounds on which he placed them, till the
enemy should approach: He placed his main battle and his rear towards the
right; and beyond the van he posted lord Gray at the head of the men at arms,
and ordered him to take the Scotch van in slank, but not till they should
be engaged in close fight with the van of the English.</P>
<P>WHILE the Scotch were advancing on the plain, they were galled
with the artillery from the English ships: The master of Graham was
killed: The Irish archers were thrown into disorder: and even the other
troops began to stagger: When the lord Gray, perceiving their situation,
neglected his orders, left his ground, and at the head of his heavy-armed
horse made an attack on the Scotch infantry, in hopes of gaining all the
honour of the victory. On advancing, he <PB N="303" REF="308"/> found a slough
and ditch in his way; and behind were ranged the Scotch infantry armed with
spears, and the field, on which they stood, was fallow ground, broken with
ridges, which lay cross their front, and disordered the movements of the
English cavalry. From all these accidents, the shock of this body of
horse was feeble and irregular; and as they were received on the points of
the Scottish spears, which were longer than the lances of the English
horsemen, they were in a moment pierced, overthrown, and discomfited. Gray
himself was dangerously wounded: Lord Edward Seymour, son to the
protector, lost his horse: The standard was near being taken: And had the
Scotch possessed any good body of cavalry, who might have pursued the
advantage, the whole English army had been exposed to great danger<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Patten, Hollingshed, p. 986.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE protector mean-while, assisted by Sir Ralph Sadler and
Sir Ralph Vane, employed himself with diligence and success, in rallying
the cavalry. War∣wic showed great presence of mind in maintaining the ranks
of the foot, on which the horse had recoiled: He made Sir Peter Meutas
advance, captain of the foot hackbutters, and Sir Peter Gamboa, captain of
some Italian and Spanish hackbutters, on horseback; and ordered them to
ply the Scotch infantry with their shot. They marched to the slough, and
discharged their pieces full in the face of the enemy: The ships galled
them from the flank: The artillery, planted on a height, infested them from
the front: The English archers poured in a shower of arrows upon them: And
the vanguard, descending from the hill, ad∣vanced, leisurely and orderly,
towards them. Dismayed with all these circum∣stances, the Scotch van
began to retreat: The retreat soon changed into a flight; which was begun by
the Irish archers. The panic of the van communicated itself to the main
body, and passing thence to the rear, rendered the whole field a scene of
confusion, terror, flight and consternation. The English army per∣ceived
from the heights the condition of the Scotch, and began the pursuit with loud
shouts and acclamations, which added still more to the dismay of the
van∣quished. The horse in particular, eager to revenge the affront, which
they had received in the beginning of the day, committed the most bloody
execution on the flying enemy; and from the field of battle to Edinburgh, for
the space of five miles, the whole ground was strowed with dead bodies. The
priests above all, and the monks received no quarter; and the English made
sport of slaugh∣tering men, who, from their extreme zeal and animosity,
had engaged in an enterprize so ill suited to their profession. Few
victories have been more de∣cisive, or gained with smaller loss to the
conquerors. There fell not two hun∣dred of the English; and according to the
most moderate computation, there <PB N="304" REF="309"/> perished above ten
thousand of the Scotch. About fifteen hundred were taken prisoners. This
action was called the Battle of Pinkey, from a nobleman's seat of that name
in the neighbourhood.</P>
<P>THE Queen dowager and Arran fled to Stirling, and were scarce
able to col∣lect such a body of forces as could check the incursions of
small parties of the English. About the same time, the earl of Lenox and
lord Wharton entered the West Marches, at the head of five thousand men,
and after taking and plun∣dering Annan, they spread devastation over all
the neighbouring counties<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hollingshed, p.
992.</NOTE>. Had Somerset prosecuted his advantage, he might have imposed
what terms he pleased on the Scotch nation: But he was impatient to return to
England, where he heard, some counsellors, and even his own brother, the
admiral, were carry∣ing on cabals against his authority. Having taken the
castles of Hume, Dun∣glass, Eymouth, Fastcastle, Roxborough, and some
other small places; and hav∣ing received the submission of some
counties on the borders, he retired out of Scotland. The fleet, besides
destroying all the ships along the coast, took Broughty in the Firth of
Tay, and having fortified it, they left there a garrison. Arran desired
leave to send commissioners in order to treat of a peace; and
So∣merset, having appointed Berwic for the place of meeting, left Warwic with
full powers to negociate: But no commissioners from Scotland ever appeared.
The overture of the Scotch was an artifice, to gain time, till succours
should arrive from France.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">4 Novemb.</NOTE> THE protector, on his
arrival in England, summoned a Parliament: And be∣ing somewhat elated with
his success against the Scotch, he procured a patent, appointing him to
sit on the throne, upon a stool or bench at the right hand of the King, and
to enjoy the same honours and privileges which had usually been
possessed by any princes of the blood, or uncles of the Kings of
England. In this patent, the King dispensed with the statute of
precedency, enacted during the former reign<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. XV. p. 164.</NOTE>. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Parliament.</NOTE> But if Somerset gave
offence by assuming too much state, he deserves the highest praise
on account of the laws passed this session, by which the rigour of
former statutes was much mitigated, and some security given to the
freedom of the con∣stitution. All laws were repealed which extended the crime
of treason beyond the statute of the twenty eighth of Edward the third<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">1 Edw. VI. c. 12.</NOTE>; all laws enacted during the
late reign, extending the crime of felony; all the former laws against
Lol∣lardies or heresy, together with the statute of the six articles.
None were to be accused of words but within a month after they were spoken.
By these repeals several of the most rigorous laws that ever were
passed in England, were an∣nulled, and some dawnings, both of civil and
religious liberty, began to appear <PB N="305" REF="310"/> to the people.
Heresy, however, was still a capital crime by the common law, and was
subjected to the penalty of burning. There only remained no precise
standard by which that crime could be defined or determined: A circumstance
which might either be advantageous or hurtful to public security, according
to the disposition of the judges.</P>
<P>A REPEAL also passed of that law, the destruction of all
laws, by which the King's proclamation was made of equal force with a
statute<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">1 Edw. VI. c.
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE>. That other law was
likewise mitigated, by which the King was empowered to annul all laws
passed before the four and twentieth year of his age: He could prevent
their future execution; but could not recall any past effects, which had
ensued from them<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>SOME statutes too were passed which were of the utmost
importance, because they promoted the principles and practices of the
reformers, tho' they may not, all of them, appear to be attended with any
material consequences to civil society. The cup was restored to the
laity; private masses were abolished; the King was empowered to create
bishops by letters patent, without any sham elec∣tion of the chapter; the
bishops were ordered to issue their writs, and hold their courts in the
King's name<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>; vagabonds were adjudged to be
slaves for two years, and to be marked with a red-hot iron<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">1 Edw. VI. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>.</NOTE>; an act commonly supposed to be levelled against the
strolling priests and friars.</P>
<P>THE chantries and free chappels had been given by act of
parliament to the late King; and he had appointed commissioners to take
possession of the reve∣nues; but as they had not proceeded far in the
execution of their office, it was found necessary to make a renewal of the
grant. The preamble to the statute promises, that these funds should be
employed to good and godly uses, in erect∣ing grammar schools, in farther
augmenting the universities, and in making better provision for the poor
and needy<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">1 Edw. VI.
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>.</NOTE>. But the rapacious
courtiers had already de∣voured the prey in their imaginations; and it was not
long before it was shared out among them.</P>
<P>IT was also enacted, that all who denied the King's
supremacy, or asserted the pope's, should, for the first offence,
forfeit their goods and chattels, and suffer imprisonment during
pleasure; for the second offence, should incur the pain of
<HI>praemunire;</HI> and for the third offence be attainted of treason. But
if any, after the first of March next, endeavoured, by writing, printing, or
any overt act or deed, to deprive the King of his estate or titles,
particularly of his supremacy, or to confer them on any other, he was to be
adjudged guilty of treason. If any of the heirs of the crown should usurp
upon another, or endeavour to break the <PB N="306" REF="311"/> order of
succession, it was declared treason in them, their aiders and abetters.
These were the most considerable acts passed during this
session. The members discovered a very passive disposition with
regard to religion: Some few appeared zealous for the reformation: Others
harboured secretly a strong inclination to the catholic faith: But the
greatest part appeared willing to take any impression which they should
receive from interest, authority, or the reigning fashion<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Heylin. p 48.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE convocation met at the same time with the Parliament; and
as it appear∣ed, that their debates were at first cramped by the rigour of
the statute of the six articles, the King granted them a dispensation
from that law, before it was re∣pealed by Parliament<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Antiq. Britan. p. 339.</NOTE>. The lower house of convocation
applied to have liberty of sitting with the commons in Parliament; or if this
privilege was refused them, which they claimed as their ancient right, they
desired that no law regard∣ing religion, might pass in Parliament without
their consent and approbation. But the principles which now prevailed, were
more advantageous to the civil than the ecclesiastical power; and tho'
there is reason to think, that the lower clergy sent, during some time,
representatives to the house of commons<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See
Atterbury's Rights, &amp;c. of an English convocation, p. 73.</NOTE>; yet
that practice had been abolished for above two centuries; and the present
juncture was very little favourable for attempting to revive it.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1548" UNIT="year"/> THE protector had permitted
the repeal of that law, which gave to the King's proclamations the authority of
statutes; but he did not intend to renounce that arbitrary or discretionary
exercise of power, which had ever been assumed by the crown, and which it
is difficult to distinguish exactly from the power of making laws. He even
continued to exert this authority in some particulars, which were regarded as
the most momentuous. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Farther pro∣gress of the reformation.</NOTE>
Orders were issued by council, that candles should no longer be carried
about on Candlemas-day, ashes on Ash-wednesday, palmes on
Palm-sunday<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. II. p. 59. Collier,
vol. II. p. 241. Heylin, p. 55.</NOTE>. These were ancient religious
practices, now deno∣minated superstitions; tho' it is very fortunate for
mankind, when superstition hap∣pens to take a direction so innocent and
inoffensive. The severe disposition which naturally attends all
reformers, prompted likewise the council to abolish some gay and showy
ceremonies, which belonged to the ancient religion<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. II.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>AN order was also issued by the council for the removal of
all images from the churches: An innovation which was much desired by all the
reformers, and which alone, with regard to the populace, amounted almost to a
total change of the established religion<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. II. p. 60. Collier, vol. II. p. 241.
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> p
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>.</NOTE>. An attempt had been made
to separate the use of images <PB N="307" REF="312"/> from their abuse,
the reverence from the worship of them; but the execu∣tion of this design
was found, upon trial, very difficult, if not wholly imprac∣ticable.</P>
<P>AS private masses were abolished by law, it became
necessary to frame a new communion-office; and the council went so far,
in the preface which they had prefixed to this work, as to leave the practice
of auricular confession wholly in∣different<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE>. This was a prelude to the entire abolition of that
invention, one of the most powerful engines that ever was contrived for
degrading the laity, and giving their spiritual guides an entire ascendant
over them. And it may justly be said, that tho' the priest's
absolution, which attends confession, serves somewhat to ease weak
minds from the immediate agonies of superstitious terror, it operates only
by strongly enforcing superstition itself, and thereby preparing the
mind for a more violent relapse into the same disorders.</P>
<P>THE people were at that time extremely distracted, by the
opposite opinions of their preachers; and as they were totally incapable to
judge of the reasons ad∣vanced on either side, and naturally regarded every
thing which they heard at church, as of equal authority, a great confusion
and fluctuation resulted from this uncertainty. The council first
endeavoured to remedy that inconvenience, by lay∣ing some restraints on
preaching; but finding this expedient ineffectual, they im∣posed a total
silence on the preachers, and thus put an end at once to all the po∣lemics of
the pulpit<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Fuller, Heylin, Burnet.</NOTE>. By the
nature of things, this restraint could only be temporary. For in proportion
as the ceremonies of public worship, its shows and exterior observances,
were retrenched by the reformers, the people were in∣clined to contract a
stronger attachment to sermons, whence alone they received any occupation
or amusement. The ancient religion, by giving its votaries some∣thing to
do, freed them from the trouble of knowing: Sermons were only deli∣vered in the
principal churches, and at some particular fasts and festivals: And the
practice of haranguing the populace, which, if abused, is so powerful an
incitement to faction and sedition, had much less scope and influence
during those ages.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Affair of Scotland.</NOTE> THE greater
progress was made towards a reformation in England, the further did the
protector find himself from all prospect of compleating the union with
Scotland; and the Queen-dowager, as well as the clergy, became the more
averse to all alliance with a nation which had departed so far from all
ancient principles. Somerset, having taken the town of Haddington, had
ordered it to be strongly garrisoned and fortified, by lord Gray: He also
erected some sortifica∣tions <PB N="308" REF="313"/> at Lauder: And he
hoped, that these two places, together with Broughty and some smaller
for<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>resses, which were in the
hands of the English, would serve as a curb to Scotland; and would give him
access into the heart of the country.</P>
<P>ARRAN, being disappointed in some attempts on Broughty,
relied chiefly on the suceours expected from France, for the recovery of
these places; and they ar∣rived at last in the Firth, to the number of
six thousand men; one half of whom were Germans. They were commanded by
Dessé, and under him by Andelot, Strozzi, Meilleraye, count
Rhingrave. The Scotch were at that time so sunk by their misfortunes, that
five hundred English horse were able to ravage the whole country without
resistance; and make inroads to the gates of the ca∣pital<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Beagué, hist. of the Campagnes, 1548 and 1549, p.
6.</NOTE>: But on the appearance of the French succours, they collected more
courage; and having joined Dessé with a considerable
reinforcement, they laid siege to Haddington<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Hollingshed, p. 993.</NOTE>. This was an undertaking for which
they were themselves totally unfit; being only practised in a kind of
desultory war, where they served without pay, and with a few weeks
provisions, which they brought along with them. Even with the
assistance of the French, they placed their chief hopes of success in
starving the garrison; and after some vain attempts to take the place by
a regular <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iege, the blockade of
Haddington was formed. The garrison were re∣pulsed with loss in several
sallies which they made upon the besiegers.</P>
<P>THE hostile attempts which the late King and the protector had
made against Scotland, not being steedy, regular, nor pushed to the
last extremity, had served only to irritate the nation, and to inspire
them with the strongest aversion to that confederacy which was courted in
so violent a manner. Even those who were inclined to the English
alliance, were displeased to have it imposed on them by force of arms;
and the earl of Huntley in particular, said pleasantly, that he disliked
not the match, but he hated the manner of wooing<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Heylin, p. 46. Patten.</NOTE>. The Queen∣dowager, finding these
sentiments to prevail, called a Parliament, in an abbey near Haddington; and
it was there proposed, that the young Queen, for her greater security,
should be sent to France, and be committed to the protection of that
ancient ally. Some objected, that this measure was desperate, allowed no
resource in case of miscarriage, exposed the Scotch to be subjected
by foreigners, involved them in perpetual war with England, and left them no
expedient by which they could conciliate the friendship of that powerful
nation. It was an∣swered, on the other hand, that the Queen's presence was
the very cause of war with England; that that nation would desist when
they found that their views <PB N="309" REF="314"/> of forcing a marriage had
become altogether impracticable; and that Henry, being engaged by so high a
mark of confidence, would take their sovereign un∣der his guardianship, and
use his utmost efforts to defend the kingdom. These arguments were aided
by French gold, which was plentifully distributed among the nobles. The
governor had a pension conferred on him of twelve thousand livres a year,
received the title of duke of Chatelrault, and obtained for his son the
command of an hundred men at arms<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. II. p.
83. Buchan. lib. XV. Keith, p. 55. Thuanus, lib. V. c. 15.</NOTE>. And as all
the clergy dreaded the consequences of the English alliance, they
seconded this measure with all the zeal and industry which either
principles or interest could inspire. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Young Queen of Scots sent into
France.</NOTE> It was accordingly determined to send the Queen to France; and
what was understood to be the ne∣cessary consequence, to marry her to
the dauphin. Villegaignon, commander of four French gallies lying in the Firth
of Forth, set sail as if he intended to return home; but when he reached
the open sea, he turned northwards, passed by the Orkneys, and came in on
the west coast at Dunbarton: A very extraordinary voyage for ships of
that fabric<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Thuanus, lib. V. c. 15.</NOTE>. The
young Queen was there committed to him; and being attended with the lords
Areskine and Livingstone, she put to sea, and after meeting with some
tempe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tuous weather, arrived
safely at Brest, whence she was conducted to Paris, and soon after
she was betrothed to the dauphin.</P>
<P>SOMERSET, pressed by many difficulties at home, and
despairing of success in his enterprize against Scotland, was
desirous of composing the differences with that kingdom, and he offered the
Scotch a ten years truce; but as they insisted on his restoring all the
places which he had taken, the proposal came to nothing. The Scotch took the
fortresses of Hume and Fast-castle, by surprize, and put the
garrison to the sword: They repulsed, with loss, the English, who,
under the command of lord Seymour, made a descent, first in Fife, and then
at Mon∣trose: In the former action, James Stuart, natural brother to the
Queen, ac∣quired great honour; in the second action, Areskine of Dun. An
attempt was made by Sir Robert Bowes and Sir Thomas Palmer, at the head of a
considerable body, to throw relief into Haddington; but these troops
falling into an ambuscade, were almost wholly cut in pieces<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Stowe, p. 595. Hollingshed, p. 994.</NOTE>. And
tho' a small body of two hundred men escaped all the vigilance of the
French, and arrived safely in Haddington, with some ammunition and
provisions, the garrison was reduced to such difficulties, that the
protector found it necessary to provide more effectu∣ally for their relief.
He raised an army of eighteen thousand men, and adding three thousand
Germans, who, on the dissolution of the protestant alliance, had offered 
<PB N="310" REF="315"/> their service to England, he gave the command of the
whole to the earl of Shrewsbury<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Hayward, p.
201.</NOTE>. D'Essé raised the siege on the approach of the
English; and with great difficulty made good his retreat to Edinburgh, where
he posted himself advantageously. Shrewsbury, who had lost the
opportunity of attack∣ing him on his march, durst not give him battle in his
present situation; and contenting himself with the advantage already
gained of supplying Haddington, he retired into England.</P>
<P>DURING the abode of the French troops many complaints had
arisen between them and the Scotch; and a small accident<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Beaagué, p. 68. Knox, p. 81.</NOTE>having excited a tumult
in Edin∣burgh, the provost and his son were unfortunately killed by the
French soldiers. This event increased the animosity between the two
nations: But D'Esse, in order to make atonement for that act of violence,
led his troops hastily to Haddington, and in the night-time attempted to
surprize the town. He found the garrison un∣prepared to resist him; and
had already entered the outer court: But a French deserter firing a cannon,
which pointed towards the gates, the shot fell among the thickest of the
enemy, and made such havoc as threw the whole into confusion, and enabled
the English to repulse them. It is pretended, that no less than a hundred
persons fell by this single shot.</P>
<P>THE French general was a man of ability and experience; but as
he had not the good fortune to be acceptable to the Scotch nation, it was
thought proper to recall him, and to send over De Thermes in his place.
D'Essé, before his de∣parture, fortified Leith, which, from a
small village, soon became a considerable town, by the concourse of
inhabitants, who found there a security, which they could no where else
enjoy in Scotland. He also attacked an English garrison in Inch-keith, an
island opposite to that harbour, and made them prisoners. After these
exploits, he resigned his command to De Thermes, who brought over with him
Monluc, bishop of Valence, a man celebrated for wisdom and capacity. This
prelate was named chancellor of the kingdom; and it was probably intend∣ed, by
his means, to inspire the nation with some greater attachment to the
prin∣ciples of law and equity: But the Scotch, impatient of restraint, and
jealous of a foreigner, expressed such discontent, that it was thought
more prudent soon after to recall him<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Burnet,
vol. II. p. 8<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. Thuanus, lib. V.

<P>THO' the protection of France was of great consequence to the
Scotch, in sup∣porting them against the invasions of England, they reaped
still more benefit from the distractions and divisions which had crept
into the councils of that latter <PB N="311" REF="316"/> kingdom. Even the two
brothers, the protector and admiral, not contented with the high stations
which they severally enjoyed, and the great eminence to which they had
risen, had entertained the most violent jealousy of each other's
authority; 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cabals of lord Seymour.</NOTE> and they
divided the whole court and kingdom, by their opposite cabals and
pre∣tensions. Lord Seymour was a man of insatiable ambition, arrogant,
assuming, implacable; and tho' esteemed of superior capacity to the
protector, he possessed not to the same degree the confidence and
regard of the people. By his flattery and address, he had so insinuated
himself into the good graces of the Queen∣dowager, that, forgetting her
usual prudence and decency, she married him im∣mediately upon the decease
of the late King: Insomuch, that, had she soon proved pregnant, it might
have been doubtful to which husband the child be∣longed. The credit and
riches of this alliance supported the ambition of the admiral; but gave
umbrage to the dutchess of Somerset, who, uneasy that the younger
brother's wife should have the precedency, employed all her interest with
her husband, which was too great, first to create, and then to widen a
breach between the two brothers<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Hayward, p. 301.

69.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE first symptoms of this misunderstanding appeared
when the protector commanded the army in Scotland. The secretary, Paget, a
man entirely devoted to Somerset, remarked, that Seymour was forming
separate intrigues among the counsellors; was corrupting, by presents,
the King's servants; and even endeavouring, by improper indulgencies and
liberalities, to captivate the affections of the young monarch. Paget
represented to him the danger of this conduct; desired him to reflect on
the numerous enemies whom the sudden elevation of their family had created;
and warned him that any dis∣sension between him and the protector, would
be greedily laid hold of, to draw on the ruin of both. Finding his
remonstrances ineffectual, he convey∣ed intelligence of the danger to
Somerset, and engaged him to leave the enter∣prize against Scotland
unfinished, in order to guard against the attempts of his domestic
enemies. In the ensuing Parliament, the admiral's projects appeared still
more hazardous to public tranquillity; and as he had acquired many partizans
and retainers, he made a direct attack upon his brother's autho∣rity. He
represented to his friends, that formerly, during a minority, the office of
protector of the kingdom had been kept separate from that of governor of the
king's person; and that the present union of these two important
trusts, conserred on Somerset an authority which could not safely be
lodged in any sub∣ject<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Haynes, p. 8<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, 90.</NOTE>. He even prevailed on the
young King, to write a letter to the Parlia∣ment, <PB N="312" REF="317"/>
desiring that Seymour might be appointed his governor; and he had formed a
party in the two houses, by which he hoped to have effected his pur∣pose.
The design was discovered before its execution; and some common friends
were sent to remonstrate with him, but had so little influence, that he
threw out many menacing expressions, and rashly threatened, that, if he
was thwarted in his attempt, he would make this Parliament the blackest that
ever was in Eng∣land<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Haynes, p. 75.</NOTE>. The council
sent for him, to answer for his conduct; but he refused to attend: They
then began to threaten in their turn, and informed him, that the King's letter,
instead of availing him any thing to the execution of his pur∣pose, would
be imputed to him as a criminal enterprize, and be construed a de∣sign to
disturb the government, by forming a separate interest with a child and
minor. They even let fall some menaces of sending him to the Tower for his
temerity; and the admiral finding himself prevented in his design, was
ob∣liged to submit, and to desire a reconcilement with his brother.</P>
<P>THE mild and moderate temper of Somerset made him willing to
forget these enterprizes of the admiral; but the ambition of that turbulent
spirit could not be so easily appeased. His spouse, the
Queen-dowager, died in child-bed; but so far from regarding this event as a
check to his aspiring views, he founded on it the scheme of a more
extraordinary elevation. He made his addresses to the lady Elizabeth, then
in the sixteenth year of her age; and that princess, whom even the hurry of
business, and the pursuits of ambition, could not, in her more advanced
years, disengage entirely from the tender passions, seems to have
listened to the insinuations of a man who possessed every talent
proper to captivate the affections of the fair<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bid. 95, 96, 107,
108.</NOTE>. But as Henry the eighth had excluded his daughters from all hopes
of succession, if they married without the consent of his executors,
which Seymour could never hope to obtain; it was concluded, that he proposed
to effectuate his purpose by expedients still more rash and more
criminal. All the other measures of the admiral tended to confirm this
suspicion. He continued to attack, by presents, the fidelity of all
those who had more imme∣diate access to the King's person: He endeavoured
to seduce that young prince into his interest: He found means of holding a
private correspondence with him: He publicly decried his brother's
administration; and asserted, that by enlisting Germans, and other
foreigners, he intended to form a mercenary army, which endangered the King's
aughority, and the liberty of the people: By promises and persuasion he
brought over to his party many of the principal nobility; and had distributed
his interest all over England: He neglected not even the most 
<PB N="313" REF="318"/> popular persons of inferior rank; and had computed,
that he could, on occasion, command the service of ten thousand men,
among his servants, tenants, and re∣tainers<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Haynes, p. 105, 106.</NOTE>: He had already provided arms for
their use; and having engaged in his interests Sir John Sharington, a very
corrupt man, master of the mint at Bristol, he flattered himself that
money would not be wanting. Somerset was well informed of all these
alarming circumstances, and endeavoured by the most friendly expedients, by
intreaty, reason, and even by heaping new favours upon him, to make him
depart from his precipitant councils: But finding all his en∣deavours
ineffectual, he began to think of more severe remedies. The earl of Warwic
was an ill instrument between the brothers; and had formed the design, by
inflaming the quarrel, to raise his own fortune on both their ruins.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dudley, earl of Warwic.</NOTE> DUDLEY, earl
of Warwic, was the son of that Dudley, minister to Henry the seventh, who
having, by rapine, extortion, and perversion of law, incurred the hatred of
the public, had been sacrificed to popular animosity, in the be∣ginning of
the subsequent reign. The late King, sensible of the iniquity, at
least illegality of the sentence, had afterwards restored young Dudley's
blood by act of parliament; and finding him endowed with ability, industry,
and enter∣prize, he had entrusted him with many important commands, and had
ever found him successful in all his undertakings. He raised him to the
dignity of viscount Lisle, conferred on him the office of admiral, and gave
him by his will a place among his executors. Dudley made still farther
progress during the mi∣nority; and having obtained the title of earl of
Warwic, and undermined the credit of Southampton, he bore the first rank
among the protector's counsellors. The victory, gained at Pinkey, was much
ascribed to his courage and conduct; and he was universally regarded as a
man equally endowed with the talents of peace and war. But all these virtues
were obscured by still greater vices; an exorbitant ambition, an
insatiable avarice, a neglect of decency, a contempt of justice: And as he
found, that lord Seymour, whose ability and enterprize he chiefly dreaded,
was involving himself in ruin, by his rash councils, he was determined to
push him to the precipice; and thereby remove the chief obstacle to his own
projected greatness.</P>
<P>WHEN Somerset found that the public peace was exposed by his
brother's sedi∣tious, if not rebellious, schemes, he was the more easily
persuaded, by Warwic, to employ the extent of royal authority against him;
and after depriving him of the office of admiral, he signed a warrant for
committing him to the Tower. Some of his accomplices were also taken into
custody; and three privy counsellors, being sent to examine them, made a
report, that they had met with very full <PB N="314" REF="319"/> and important
discoveries. Yet still the protector suspended the blow, and showed a
reluctance to ruin his brother. He offered to depart from the prosecu∣tion,
if Seymour would promise him a cordial reconcilement; and relinquishing all
ambitious hopes, be contented with a private life, and retire into the country.
But as Seymour made no other answer to these friendly offers than menaces
and defiances, he ordered a charge to be drawn up against him, consisting
of thirty-three articles<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. II. Coll.
31. 2 &amp; 3 Edw. VI. c. 18.</NOTE>; and the whole to be laid before the
privy-council. It is pre∣tended, that every particular was so incontestibly
proved, both by witnesses and his own hand-writing, that there was no room
for doubt; yet did the council think proper to go in a body to the Tower, in
order more fully to examine the prisoner. He was not daunted by the
appearance; but boldly demanded a fair trial; required to be confronted with
the witnesses; desired that the charge might be left with him, in order
to be considered; and refused to answer any interroga∣tories, by which he
might ensnare himself.</P>
<P>IT is apparent, that notwithstanding what is pretended, there
must have been some deficiency in the evidence against Seymour, when
such demands, founded on the plainest principles of law and equity, were
absolutely rejected. We shall indeed conclude, if we carefully examine the
charge, that many of the articles were general, and scarce capable of any
proof; many of them, if true, sus∣ceptible of a more favourable
interpretation; and that, tho' on the whole, Sey∣mour appears to have been a
very dangerous subject, yet he had not advanced far in those treasonable
projects imputed to him. The chief part of his guilt seems to have
consisted in some unwarrantable practices in the admiralty, by which
pyrates were protected, and illegal impositions laid upon the merchants.</P>
<P>BUT the administration had, at that time, an easy
instrument of vengeance, to wit, the Parliament; and needed not give
themselves any concern with regard either to the guilt of the persons whom
they prosecuted, or the evidence which could be produced against them. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Parliament.</NOTE> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">4 Novem∣ber.</NOTE> A session of
Parliament being held, it was proposed to proceed against Seymour by bill
of attainder; and much persuasion being employed to engage the young King
to consent to it, a considerable weight was put on his approbation.
<MILESTONE N="1549" UNIT="year"/> The matter was first laid before the upper
house; and several peers, rising up in their places, gave an account of
what they knew concerning lord Seymour's conduct, and his criminal words or
actions. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Attainder of lord Seymour.</NOTE> These
narratives were received for undoubted evidence; and tho' the prisoner had
for∣merly engaged many friends and partizans among the nobility, no one had
either the courage or equity to move, that he might be heard in his own
defence, that the testimony against him should be delivered in a legal
manner, and that he <PB N="315" REF="320"/> should be confronted with the
witnesses. A little more scruple was made in the house of commons:
There were even some members who objected against the whole method of
proceeding by bills of attainder, passed in absence; and required, that a
formal trial should be given to every man before his condemnation. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">20th March.</NOTE> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">His execu∣tion.</NOTE> But upon receiving a
message from the King, requiring them to proceed, and offering that the
same narratives should be laid before them which had satisfied the peers,
they were easily prevailed on to acquiesce<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 &amp;
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Edw. VI. c. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE>. The bill passed in a very
full house. Near four hundred voted for it; and not above nine or ten
against it<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> vol II. p. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></NOTE>. The sentence was soon after executed, and the
prisoner was beheaded on Tower∣hill. The warrant was signed by Somerset,
who was exposed to much blame, on account of the violence of these
proceedings. The attempts of the admiral seemed chiefly to be levelled
against his brother's usurped authority; and tho' his ambitious,
enterprizing character, encouraged by a marriage with the lady Eli∣zabeth,
might have proved dangerous to public tranquillity, the prudence of
foreseeing dangers at such a distance, was esteemed too great, and the
remedy was plainly illegal. It could only be said, that this bill of
attainder was some∣what more tolerable than the preceding ones, to which the
nation had been ac∣customed. For here, at least, some shadow of
evidence was produced.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ecclesiastical affairs.</NOTE> ALL the
other considerable business transacted this session, besides
the attainder of lord Seymour, regarded ecclesiastical matters; which were
now the chief concern of the nation. A committee of bishops and divines had
been appointed by the council, to frame a liturgy for the service of the
church; and they had executed the work committed to them. They proceeded with
great moderation in this delicate undertaking: They retained as much of the
ancient mass as the principles of the reformers would permit: They indulged
nothing to the spirit of contradiction, which so naturally takes place in
all great innovations: And they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lattered themselves, that they had framed a service, in which
every denomination of Christians might, without scruple, concur. The mass
had been always celebrat∣ed in Latin; a practice which might have been
esteemed absurd, had it not been found useful to the clergy, by
impressing the people with an idea of some myste∣rious unknown virtue
in those rites, and by checking all their pretensions to be familiarly
acquainted with their religion. But as the reformers pretended in some few
particulars to encourage private judgment in the
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ity, the translation of the
liturgy, as well as of the scriptures, into the vulgar tongue, seemed more
con∣formable to the genius of their sect; and this innovation, with the
retrenchment of prayers to saints, and of some superstitious
ceremonies, was the chief differ∣ence <PB N="316" REF="321"/> between the old
mass and the new liturgy. The Parliament established this form of
worship in all the churches, and ordered an uniformity to be ob∣served in
all the rites and ceremonies<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">2 &amp; 3 Edw. VI.
cap. 1.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THERE was another very material act, which passed this
session. The former canons had established the celibacy of the
clergy; and though this practice be usually ascribed to the policy of the
court of Rome, who thought, that the eccle∣siastics would be more devoted
to their spiritual head, and less dependant on the civil magistrate, when
freed from the powerful tyes of wives and children; yet was this institution
much forwarded by the principles of superstition inherent in human nature.
These principles had rendered the panegyrics of an inviolate chastity so
frequent among the antient fathers, long before the establishment of
celibacy. And even the English parliament, though they framed a law,
permitting the marriages of priests, yet confess, in the preamble, 
<Q REND="inline">"that it were better for priests and the
ministers of the church to live chaste and without marriage, and it were
much to be wished they would of themselves abstain."</Q> The
inconveni∣ences, which had arisen from compelling chastity and prohibiting
marriage, are the reason assigned for indulging a liberty in this
particular<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">2 &amp; 3 Edw. VI. cap. 21.</NOTE>.
The ideas of pen∣nance also were so much retained in other particulars,
that an act of parliament passed, prohibiting the use of flesh, during
Lent and the other times of absti∣nence<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"> 
<P>2 &amp; 3 Edw. VI. cap. 19. Another act, passed this
session, takes notice in the preamble, that the city of York, formerly
well inhabited, was now much decayed: Insomuch that many of the cures could
not afford a competent maintenance to the incumbents. To remedy this
inconvenience, the magistrates were empowered to unite as many parish<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> as they thought proper. An
ecclesiastical historian, Collier, vol. ii. p. 230, thinks, that this
decay of York is chiefly to be ascribed to the dissolution of
monasteries, by which the revenues fell into the hands of persons who lived
at a distance.</P> 
<P>A very grievous tax was imposed this session upon
the whole stock and monied interest of the king∣dom, and even upon its
industry. It was a shilling in the pound yearly, during three years, on
every person worth ten pounds or upwards: The double on aliens and denizons.
These last, if above twelve years of age, and if worth less than twenty
shillings, were to pay eight pence yearly. Every wether was to pay two pence
yearly; every ewe three pence. The woolen manufacturers were to pay eight pence
a pound on the value of all the cloth they made. These exorbitant taxes on
money are a proof, that few people lived on the money lent out at interest:
For this tax amounts to the half of the yearly income of all money-holders,
during three years, estimating their interest at the rate allowed by law;
and was too grievous to be born, if many persons had been affected by it. It
is remarkable, that no tax at all was laid upon land this session. The
profits of merchandise were commonly so high, that it was supposed it
could bear this imposition. The most absurd part of the law seems to be
the tax upon the woolen manufacture. See 2 &amp; 3 Edw. VI. cap. 36. The
subsequent Parliament repealed the tax on sheep and woolen cloth. 3 &amp;
4 Edw. VI. cap. 23. But they continued the other tax a year longer. Ibid.</P> 
<P>The clergy taxed themselves at six shillings in the
pound to be paid in three years. This taxation was ratified in Parliament,
which had been the common practice since the reformation, as if the clergy
had no legislative power, even over themselves. See 2 &amp; 3 Edw. VI. cap.
35.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="317" REF="322"/> THE principal tenets and practices of the
catholic religion were now abolished, and the reformation, such as we enjoy
it at present, was almost entirely compleated in England. But the doctrine
of the real presence, though tacitly condemned by the new communion-service
and by the prohibition of many antient rites, still retained some hold of
the minds of men; and it was the last doctrine of popery, which was wholly
abandoned by the people<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. II. cap.
104.</NOTE>. The extreme attachment of the late King to that tenet might be
some ground for this obstinacy; but the chief cause was really the
extreme absurdity of the principle itself, and the profound vene∣ration,
which of course it impressed on the understanding. The priests
likewise were much inclined to favour an opinion, which attributed to them
so miracu∣lous a power; and the people, who believed that they participated
of the very body and blood of their Saviour, were loth to renounce so
extraordinary, and as they imagined, so salutary a privilege. The general
attachment to this dogma was so violent, that the Lutherans,
notwithstanding their separation from Rome, had thought proper, under
another name, still to retain it: And the catholic preachers, in England,
when restrained in every other particular, could not forbear, on every
occasion, from inculcating that tenet. Bonner, for this offence among others,
had been tried by the council, had been deprived of his see, and had been
committed to custody. Gardiner also, who had recovered his liberty,
appeared anew refractory to the authority, which established the late
innovations; and he seemed willing to countenance that opinion, much favoured
by all the English catholics, that the King was indeed supreme head of the
church, but not the council, during a minority. Having declined giving full
satis∣faction on this head, he was sent to the Tower, and threatened with
farther effects of the council's displeasure.</P>
<P>THESE severities, being exercised against men,
possessed of office and autho∣rity, seemed a necessary policy, in
order to inforce an uniformity in public worship and discipline: But there
were other instances of persecution, which were derived from no other
origin than the bigotry of theologians; a malady, which seems almost
incurable. Tho' the protestant divines had ventured to renounce opinions,
deemed certain during so many centuries, they regarded, in their turn, the
new system as so certain, that they could bear no contradiction 
<PB N="318" REF="323"/> with regard to it; and they were ready to burn in the
same flames, from which they themselves had so narrowly escaped, every
one who had the assurance to oppose them. A commission by act of
council was granted to the primate and some others, to examine and search
after all anabaptists, heretics, or contemners of the book of common
prayer<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>
III. Rymer, tom. XV. p. 181.</NOTE>. They were enjoined to reclaim them, if
possible; to impose pennance on them; and to give them absolution: Or
if they were obstinate, to excommunicate and imprison them, and to deliver
them over to the secular arm: And in the execution of this charge, the
commissioners were not bound to observe the ordinary methods of trial;
the forms of law were dispensed with, and if any statutes happened to
interfere with the powers in the commission, they were over-ruled and
abrogated by the council. Some tradesmen in London were brought before
these commissioners, and were accused of maintaining, among other
opinions, that a man regenerate could not sin, and that though the outward
man might offend, the inward was incapable of all guilt. They were prevailed on
to abjure and were dismissed. But there was a woman accused of
heretical pravity, called Joan Bocher, or Joan of Kent, who was so extremely
obstinate, that the commissioners could gain nothing upon her. Her
doctrine was, 
<Q REND="inline">"that Christ was not truly incarnate of the
virgin, whose flesh, being the outward man, was sinfully begotten and
born in sin; and consequently, he could take none of it: But the word, by
the consent of the inward man of the virgin, was made flesh<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. II. coll.

<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>.</NOTE>."</Q> This opinion, it
would seem, is not orthodox; and there was a necessity for delivering the
woman to the flames for maintaining it. But the young King, tho' in such
tender years, had more sense than all his counsellors and preceptors; and
he long refused to sign the warrant for her execution. Cranmer was employed
to perswade him to compliance; and he said, that there was a great
difference between errors in other points of divinity, and those which were
directly contradictory to the Apostles creed: Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se latter were impieties against God, which the
prince, being God's deputy, ought to repress; in like manner, as the King's
deputies were bound to punish offences against the King's person. Edward,
overcome by importunity more than reason, at last submit∣ted, tho' with
tears in his eyes; and he told Cranmer, that, if any wrong was done, the guilt
should lie entirely on his head. The primate, after making a new effort to
reclaim the woman from her errors, and finding her obstinate against all
his arguments, at last committed her to the flames. Some time after, a
Dutchman, called Van Paris, accused of the heresy which has received the
name of Arianism, was condemned to the same punishment. He 
<PB N="319" REF="324"/> suffered with so much satisfaction, that he hugged
and caressed the faggots, which were consuming him; a species of frenzy
of which there is more than one instance among the martyrs of this age<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. II. p. 112. Strype's Mem. Cranm. p. 181.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THESE rigorous methods of proceeding soon brought the whole
nation to a conformity with the new doctrine and the new liturgy. The lady Mary
alone continued to adhere to the mass, and refused to admit the
established modes of worship. When pressed and menaced on this head,
she applied to the emperor; who, using his interest with Sir Philip
Hobbey, the English ambassador, pro∣cured her a temporary connivance from
the council<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Heylin, p. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>.</NOTE>.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Discontents of the people.</NOTE> THERE is
no abuse so great, in civil society, as not to be attended with a great
variety of beneficial consequences; and in the beginnings of re∣formation,
the loss of these advantages is always felt very sensibly, while the
benefit, resulting from the change, is the slow effect of time, and is
seldom per∣ceived by the bulk of a nation. Scarce any institution can be
imagined less fa∣vourable, in the main, to the interests of mankind than
that of monks and friars; yet was it followed by many good effects, which,
having ceased by the suppres∣sion of monasteries, were very much
regreted by the people of England. The monks, residing always in their
convents, in the heart of their estates, spent their money in the provinces
and among their tenants, afforded a ready market for commodities, were a sure
resource to the poor and indigent; and though their hospitality and charity
gave but too much encouragement to idleness, and pre∣vented the encrease of
public riches, yet did it provide to many a remedy against 
<PB N="320" REF="325"/> the extreme pressures of want and necessity. It
is also observable, that, as the friars were limited by the rules of their
institution, to a certain train of life, they had not equal motives for
avarice with other men; and they were acknow∣ledged to have been in England, as
they still are in Roman catholic countries, the best and most indulgent
landlords. The abbots and priors were allowed to give leases at an
under-value, and to receive, in return, a large present from the tenant; in
the same manner as is still practised by the bishops and colleges. But
when the abbey-lands were distributed among the great nobility and courtiers,
they fell under a different management: The rents of farms were raised, while
the tenants found not the same facility in disposing of the produce; the
money was spent in the capital; and the farmers, living at a distance, were
exposed to all the oppressions of their new masters, or to the still
greater rapacity of the stewards.</P>
<P>THESE complaints of the common people were at that time
heightened by other causes. The arts of manufacture were much more advanced
in other Eu∣ropean countries than in England; and even in England these arts
had made greater progress than the knowledge of agriculture; a
profession, which of all mechanical employments, requires the most
reflection and experience. A great demand arose for wool both abroad and at
home: Pasturage was found more profitable than unskilful tillage: Whole
estates were laid waste by inclosures: The tenants, regarded as a
useless burthen, were expelled their habitations: Even the cottagers,
deprived of the commons, on which they fed their cattle, were reduced to
misery: And a great decay of people, as well as diminution of the former
plenty, was remarked in the kingdom<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Strype, vol. II.
Repository Q.</NOTE>. This grievance was now of an old date; and Sir Thomas
More, alluding to it, observes in his Utopia, that a sheep had become in
England a more rapacious animal than a lion or wolf, and devoured whole
villages, cities, and provinces.</P>
<P>THE general encrease also of gold and silver in Europe,
after the discovery of the West Indies, had a tendency to inflame these
complaints. The growing de∣mand, in the more commercial countries, had
heightened every where the price of commodities, which could easily be
transported thither; but in England, the labour of men, who could not so
easily change their habitation, still remained nearly at the antient rates;
and the poor people complained that they could no longer gain a
subsistence by their industry. It was by an addition alone of toil and
application they were enabled to provide a maintenance; and tho' this
en∣crease of industry was at last the effect of the present
situation, and an effect <PB N="321" REF="326"/> very beneficial to society,
yet was it difficult for the people to shake off their former habits of
indolence; and nothing but necessity could compel them to that exertion of
their faculties.</P>
<P>IT must also be remarked, that the profusion of Henry the
eighth, had re∣duced him, notwithstanding his rapacity, to such
difficulties, that he had been obliged to remedy a present necessity, by
the pernicious expedient of debasing the coin; and the wars, in which the
protector had been involved, had induced him to carry still farther the
same abuse. The usual consequences ensued: The good coin was hoarded
or exported; base metal was coined at home or imported from abroad in great
abudance; the common people, who received their wages in it, could not
purchase commodities at the usual rates; an universal diffidence and
stagnation of commerce took place; and loud complaints were heard in every
part of England.</P>
<P>THE protector, who loved popularity, and compassionated the
condition of the people, encouraged these complaints by his endeavours to
remedy them. He appointed a commission for making enquiry concerning
inclosures; and issued a proclamation, ordering all late inclosures to
be laid open by a day assigned. The populace, meeting with such
countenance from the government, began to rise in several places, and to
commit disorders; but were quieted by remonstrances and persuasion. In
order to give them greater satisfaction, Somerset appointed new
commissioners, whom he sent every where, with an unlimited power to hear
and determine all causes about inclosures, high-ways, and cottages<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. II. p. 115. Strype, vol. II. p. 171.</NOTE>. As
the object of this commission was very disagreeable to the gentry and
nobility, they called the commission arbitrary and illegal; and the common
people, fearing it would be eluded, and being impatient for immediate
redress, could no longer contain their sury, but sought for a remedy by
force of arms. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Insurrections.</NOTE> The rising began at
once in several parts of England, as if an universal conspiracy had been
formed by the commonalty. The insurgents in Wiltshire were dispersed by
Sir William Her∣bert: Those in the neighbouring counties, Oxford and
Glocester, by lord Gray of Wilton. Many of the rioters were killed in the
field: Others were executed by martial law. The commotions in Hampshire,
Sussex, Kent, and other coun∣ties, were quieted by gentler methods; but the
disorders in Devonshire and Nor∣folk threatened the most fatal
consequences.</P>
<P>THE commonalty in Devonshire began with the usual pretence
of inclosures and of oppressions from the gentry; but the parish
priest of Sampford-Courtenay, had the address to give their discontents a
direction towards religion; and the delicacy of this subject, in the
present emergence, made the insurrection imme∣diately <PB N="322" REF="327"/> appear dangerous. In other counties, the gentry had kept closely
united with the government; but here many of them took part with the populace;
among others, Humphrey Arundel, governor of St. Michael's Mount. The rioters
were brought to the form of a regular army, and amounted to the number of
10,000 men. Lord Russel had been sent against them at the head of a
small force; but finding himself too weak to encounter them in the field,
he kept at a dis∣tance, and began to treat and negotiate with them; in hopes
of eluding their fury by delay, and of dispersing them by the difficulty of
their subsisting to∣gether. Their demands were, that the mass should
be restored, half of the abbey-lands resumed, the law of the six articles
executed, holy water and holy bread respected, and all other particular
grievances redressed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hayward, p. 292.
Hollingshed, p. 1003. Fox, vol. II. p. 666. Mem. Cranm. p. 186.</NOTE>. The
council, to whom Russel transmitted these demands, sent a haughty
answer; exhorted the rebels to disperse; and promised them pardon upon
their immediate submission. Enraged at this disappointment, they
marched to Exeter; carrying before them crosses, banners, holy water,
candlesticks, and other implements of the antient superstition; together
with the hoste, which they covered with a canopy<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Heylin, p. 76.</NOTE>. The inhabitants of Exeter shut their
gates; and the insurgents, as they had no can∣non, endeavoured to take the
place, first by scalade, then by mining, but were repulsed in all their
attempts. Russel meanwhile lay at Honiton, till reinforced by Sir William
Herbert, and lord Gray, with some German horse, and some Italian
arquebusiers under Battista Spinola. He then resolved to attempt the
relief of Exeter, which was now reduced to extremities. He attacked the
re∣bels, drove them from all their posts, committed great slaughter upon
them both in the action and pursuit<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Stow's
Annals, p. 597. Hayward, p. 295.</NOTE>, and took many prisoners. Arundel and
the other leaders were sent to London, tried and executed. Many of the
inferior sort were put to death by martial law<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Hayward, p. 295, 296.</NOTE>: The vicar of St. Thomas, one of the
principal incendiaries, was hanged on the top of his own tower, arrayed in his
popish weeds, with his beads at his girdle<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Heylin, p. 76. Hollingshed, p. 1026.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE insurrection in Norfolk rose still to a greater
height, and was attended with greater violences. The populace were at first
excited, as in other places, by the complaints against inclosures; but
finding their numbers amount to twenty thou∣sand men, they grew insolent on
their force, and proceeded to more exorbitant pretensions. They required the
suppression of the gentry, the placing new coun∣sellors about the King,
and the re-establishment of the antient rites. One Ket, a tanner, had
assumed the government of them; and he exercised his authority 
<PB N="323" REF="328"/> with the utmost insolence and outrage. Having taken
possession of Moushold-Hill near Norwich, he erected his tribunal
under an old oak, thence called the oak of reformation; and summoning the
gentry to appear before him, he gave such decrees as might be expected from
his character and situation. The mar∣quis of Northampton was first ordered
against him; but met with a repulse, in an action, where lord Sheffield was
killed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Stowe, p. 597. Hollingshed, 1030-31.
Strype, Vol. II. p. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>.</NOTE>. The
protector affected popu∣larity, and cared not to appear in person against
the insurgents: He therefore sent next the earl of Warwic at the head of
6000 men, levied for the wars against Scotland; and he thereby afforded his
mortal enemy an opportunity of augment∣ing his reputation and character.
Warwic, having tried some skirmishes with the rebels, at last made a
general attack upon them, and put them to flight. Two thousand of them fell
in the fight and pursuit: Ket was hanged at Nor∣wich castle; nine of his
followers on the boughs of the oak of reformation; and the insurrection was
entirely suppressed. Some rebels in Yorkshire, hearing of the fate of
their companions, accepted the offers of pardon, and threw down their arms. A
general indemnity was soon after published by the protector<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Hayward, p. 297, 298, 299.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Conduct of the war with Scotland.</NOTE>BUT
tho' the insurrections were thus quickly suppressed in England, and no
traces of them seemed to remain, they were attended with very bad
consequences with regard to the foreign interests of the nation. The forces
of the earl of Warwic, which might have made a great impression on
Scotland, were diverted from that enterprize; and De Thermes had leizure to
reduce that country to some settlement and composure. He took the
fortress of Broughty, and put the garrison to the sword. He straitened
the English at Haddington; and though lord Dacres found means to throw relief
into the place, and to reinforce the gar∣rison, it was found very
expensive, and even impracticable to keep possession of that
fortress. The whole country in the neighbourhood was laid waste by the
inroads both of the Scotch and English, and could afford no supply to the
gar∣rison: The place lay above thirty miles from the borders; so that a
regular army was necessary to escort thither any provisions: And as the
plague had broke out among the troops, they perished daily, and were reduced
to a state of great weakness. For these reasons, orders were given to
dismantle Haddington, and to convoy the artillery and garrison to Berwic;
and the earl of Rutland, now created warden of the east marches, executed the
orders.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">With France.</NOTE> THE King of France also
took advantage of the distractions of the English, in order to recover
Boulogne, and that territory, which Henry the eighth had con∣quered from
France. Under other pretences, he assembled an army; and
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>lling <PB N="324" REF="329"/>
suddenly upon the Boullonois, took the castles of Sellacque, Blackness,
and Ambleteuse, tho' well supplied with garrisons, ammunition, and
provisions<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Thuanus, lib. vi c. 6.</NOTE>. He
attempted to surprize Boulenberg, and was repulsed; but the garrison, not
thinking the place tenable after the loss of the other fortresses,
destroyed the works, and retired to Boulogne. The rains, which fell in great
abundance during the autumn, and a pestilential distemper, which broke out
in the French camp, depriv∣ed Henry of all hopes of success against
Boulogne itself; and he retired to Paris<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Hayward, p. 300.</NOTE>. He left the command of the army to
Gaspar de Coligny, lord of Chatillon, so famous afterwards under the name
of admiral Coligny; and he gave him orders to form the siege early in the
spring. The active disposition of this general engaged him to make during
the winter several attempts against the place; but they proved all
unsuccessful.</P>
<P>STROZZI, who commanded the French fleet and galleys, endeavoured
to make a descent on Jersey; but meeting there with an English fleet, an
action ensued, which seems not to have been decisive, since the
historians of the two nations differ so widely in their accounts of the
event<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Le Thou, King Edward's Journal, Stow, p.
597.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>AS soon as the French war broke out, the protector endeavoured
to fortify himself with the alliance of the emperor; and he sent over
secretary Paget to Brussels, where Charles then resided, in order to
assist Sir Philip Hobby, the or∣dinary ambassador, in this
negotiation. But that prince had formed a design of extending his dominions
by acting the part of champion to the catholic religion; and tho' extremely
desirous of fortifying himself by the English alliance against France,
his capital enemy, he thought it unsuitable to his other pretensions to
enter into strict confederacy with a nation, which had broke off all
connexions with the church of Rome. He therefore declined all advances of
friendship from England; and eluded the applications of the ambassadors.
An exact ac∣count is preserved of this negotiation in a letter of Hobby; and
it is remark∣able, that the emperor, in a conversation with the English
ministers, asserted, that the prerogatives of a King of England were more
extensive than those of a King of France<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. II. p. 132, 175.</NOTE>. Burnet, who preserves this
letter, subjoins, as a parallel instance, that one objection which the
Scotch made to marrying their Queen with Edward, was that all their privileges
would be swallowed up by the great prerogative of the Kings of England<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Id. p. 133.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>SOMERSET, finding no assistance from the emperor, was
inclined to conclude a peace with France and Scotland; and besides that he
was not in a condition to maintain such ruinous wars, he thought, that there
no longer remained any ob∣ject <PB N="325" REF="330"/> of hostilities. The
Scotch had sent away their Queen; and could not, if ever so much inclined,
compleat the marriage contracted with Edward: And as Henry the eighth had
stipulated to restore Boulogne in 1554, it seemed a matter of small
consequence to anticipate a few years, the term of the treaty. But when he
proposed these reasons to the council, he met with strong opposition
from his enemies, who, seeing him unable to support the war, were
determined, for that very reason, to oppose all proposals for a
pacification. The factions ran very high in the court of England; and matters
were drawing to an issue, fatal to the authority of the protector.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Factions in the council.</NOTE>AFTER
Somerset obtained the patent, investing him with regal authority, he no
longer paid any attention to the opinion of the other counsellors; and being
elated with his high dignity, as well as with his victory at Pinkey, he
thought, that every one ought, in every thing, to yield to his sentiments.
All those who were not entirely devoted to him, were sure to be neglected;
whoever opposed his will received marks of anger or contempt<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Strype, vol▪ II. p. 181.</NOTE>; and while he showed
a resolution to govern every thing, his capacity appeared not, in any
respect, proportioned to his ambition. Warwic, more subtle and artificial,
covered more exorbitant views under fairer appearances; and having
associated himself with Southampton, who had been readmitted into the
council, he formed a strong party, who were de∣termined to free themselves
from the slavery, imposed on them by the protector.</P>
<P>THE malecontent counsellors found the disposition of the
nation very favourable to their designs. The nobility and gentry were in
general displeased with the preference, which Somerset seemed to have
given the people; and as they ascribed all the insults to which they had
been lately exposed, to his procrastination, and to the encouragement given
the multitude, so they apprehended a renewal of the same disorders from
his present affectation of popularity. He had erected a court of requests
in his own house for the relief of the people<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>b. p. 183.</NOTE>,
and he inter∣posed with the judges in their behalf; a measure which might
be denominated illegal, if any exertion of prerogative, at that time, could
with certainty deserve that appellation. And this attempt, which was a
stretch of power, seemed the more unpolitic, that it disgusted the
nobility, the surest support of monarchical authority.</P>
<P>BUT tho' Somerset courted the people, the interest, which he
had formed with them, was in no degree answerable to his expectations. The
catholic party, who retained influence with the multitude, were his declared
enemies; and took ad∣vantage of every opportunity to decry his conduct. The
attainder and execution of his brother bore an odious aspect: The
introduction of foreign troops into the <PB N="326" REF="331"/> kingdom, was
represented in very invidious colours: The great estate which he had
suddenly acquired, at the expence of the church and of the crown, rendered
him obnoxious: And the palace which he was building in the Strand, served, by
its magnificence, and still more by other circumstances which attended it,
to expose him to the censures of the public. The parish church of St.
Mary, with three bishops houses, were pulled down, to furnish ground and
materials for this structure: Not contented with that sacrilege, an attempt
was made to demolish St. Margaret's, Westminster, and to employ the
stones to the same purpose; but the parishioners rose in a tumult,
and chaced away the protector's tradesmen. He then laid his hands on a chapel
in St. Paul's Church-yard, with a cloister, and charnel-house belonging to
it; and these edifices, together with a church of St. John of Jerusalem,
were made use of to raise his palace. To render the matter more odious to
the people, the tombs, and other monuments of the dead were defaced; and the
bones carried away, and buried in unconsecrated ground<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Heylin, p. 72, 73. Stowe's Survey of London. Hayward, p. 30<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">6th October.</NOTE> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Conspiracy against So∣merset.</NOTE> ALL
these imprudences were remarked by Somerset's enemies, who resolved to
take advantage of them. The lord St. John, president of the council, the
earls of Warwic, Southampton, and Arundel, with five counsellors more, met at
Ely-house; and assuming to themselves the whole power of the council,
began to act independent of the protector, whom they represented as the
author of every public grievance and misfortune. They wrote letters to the
chief nobility and gentry in England, informing them of the present
measures, and requiring their assistance: They sent for the mayor and
aldermen of London, and enjoin∣ed them to obey their orders, without regard to
any contrary orders which they should receive from the duke of Somerset.
They laid the same injunctions on the lieutenant of the tower, who
expressed his resolution to comply with them. Next day, Rich, lord
chancellor, the marquis of Northampton, the earl of Shrewsbury, Sir Thomas
Cheney, Sir John Gage, Sir Ralph Sadler, and the lord chief justice Montague,
joined the malecontent counsellors; and every thing bore a bad aspect for
the protector's authority. Secretary Petre, whom he had sent to treat with
the council, chose rather to remain with them; and the com∣mon council of the
city, being applied to, declared with one voice their appro∣bation of the new
measures, and their resolution of supporting them<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Stowe, p.

<P>THE protector had no sooner heard of the defection of the
counsellors, than he removed the King from Hampton-court, where he then
resided, to the castle <PB N="327" REF="332"/> of Windsor; and, arming his
friends and servants, seemed resolute to defend himself against all
his enemies. But finding, that no man of rank, except Cran∣mer and Paget,
adhered to him, that the people did not rise at his summons, that the City
and Tower had declared against him, that even his best friends and
confidents had deserted him, he lost all hopes of success, and began to
apply to his enemies for pardon and forgiveness. No sooner was this
despondency known, than lord Russel, Sir John Baker, speaker of the
house of commons, and three counsellors more, who had hitherto remained
neuters, joined Warwic's party, whom every body now regarded as masters. The
council informed the public, by proclamation, of their actions and intentions;
they wrote to the princesses Mary and Elizabeth, to the same purpose;
they made addresses to the King, in which, after the humblest
protestations of duty and obedience, they informed him, that they were the
council appointed by his father, for the government of the kingdom during his
minority; that they had chosen the duke of Somerset protector, with the
express condition that he should guide himself by their advice and
direction; that he had usurped the whole authority to himself, and had
ne∣glected, and even in every thing opposed, their advice; that he had
proceeded to that height of presumption, as to levy forces against them,
and place these forces about his majesty's person: They therefore begged,
that they might be admitted to his royal presence, that he would be pleased
to restore them to his confidence, and that Somerset's servants might be
dismissed. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Somerset re∣signs the

capitulated only for gentle treatment, which was pro∣mised him. He was,
however, sent to the Tower<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Stowe, p. 600.</NOTE>,

against him<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. II. book i. coll. 46.

chief, at least the best founded, is his usurpation of the government,
and his taking into his own hands the whole administration of affairs. The
clause of his patent, which invested him with absolute power, unlimited
by any law, was never objected to him; plainly, because, according to the
sentiments of those times, that power was, in some degree, involved in
the very idea of regal authority.</P>
<P>THE catholics were extremely elevated with this revolution; and
as they had ascribed all the late innovations to Somerset's councils, they
hoped, that his fall would prepare the way for the return of the ancient
religion. But Warwic, who now bore chief sway in the council, was entirely
indifferent with regard to all these points of controversy; and finding,
that the principles of the reformation <PB N="328" REF="333"/> had sunk deeper
into the young prince's mind than to be easily eradicated, he was determined
to comply with his inclinations, and not to hazard his new acquired power by
any hazardous councils. He took care very early to express his inten∣tions of
supporting the reformation; and he threw such discouragements on
Southampton, who stood at the head of the Romanists, and whom he
considered as a dangerous rival, that the high-spirited nobleman retired
from the council, and soon after died of vexation and disappointment. The
other counsellors, who had concurred in bringing about the revolution,
received their reward, by pro∣motions and new honours. Russel was created
earl of Bedford: The marquis of Northampton obtained the office of great
chamberlain; and lord Wentworth, besides the office of chamberlain of the
houshold, got two large manors, Step∣ney and Hackney, which were torne from
the see of London<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Heylin, p. 85. Rymer, tom.
XV. p. 226.</NOTE>. A council of regency was formed, not that which Henry's
will had appointed for the govern∣ment of the kingdom, and which, being founded
on an act of parliament, was the only lawful one; but composed chiefly of
members who had formerly been ap∣pointed by Somerset, and who derived their
seats from an authority which was now declared usurped and illegal. But
such niceties were, during that age, little understood, and still less
regarded, in England.</P>

had been prevailed with to confess, on his knees, before the council, all the
articles of charge against him; and he imputed these misdemeanors to his
own rashness, folly, and indiscretion, not to any malignity of his
intention<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Heylin, p. 84. Heyward, p. 3<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>9. Sto<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, p. 603.</NOTE>. He even subscribed this confession; and
the paper was given in to the Parliament, who, after sending a committee to
exa∣mine him, and hear him acknowlege it to be authentic, passed a vote, by
which they deprived him of all his offices, and fined him in two thousand
pounds a year of land. Lord St. John was created treasurer in his place, and
Warwic earl marshal. The prosecution against him was carried no farther.
His fine was remitted by the King: He recovered his liberty: And Warwic,
thinking that he was now sufficiently humbled, and that his authority was
much lessen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d by his late tame
and abject behaviour, re-admitted him into the council, and even agreed to an
alliance between their families, by the marriage of his son, lord Dudley,
with the lady Jane Seymour, daughter to Somerset<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Heyward, p. 3<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>9.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="329" REF="334"/> DURING this session a severe act
was passed against riots<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> &amp; 4 Edw. VI. c. 5.</NOTE>; that if
any, to the number of twelve persons, should meet together for any matter
of state, and be∣ing required by any lawful magistrate, should not
disperse themselves, it should be treason; and if any broke hedges,
or violently pulled up pales about inclo∣sures, without lawful authority, it
should be felony: Any attempt to kill a privy counsellor, was subjected
to the same penalty. The bishops had made an application, complaining, that
they were deprived of all their power, by the en∣croachments of the civil
courts, and the present suspension of the canon law; that they could
summon no offenders before them, punish no vice, nor exert the discipline
of the church: From which diminution of their authority, they pretended,
immorality had every where received great encouragement and increase. The
design of some was, to revive the penitentiary rules of the primitive
church: But others thought, that such an authority committed to the
bishops, would prove more oppressive than con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ession, penance, and all the
clerical inventions of the ancient superstition. The Parliament, for the
present, contented themselves with empowering the King to appoint
thirty-two commissioners to frame a body of canon laws, which were to be
valid tho' never ratified by Parliament. Such implicit trust did they
repose in the crown, tho' all their liberties and pro∣perties might be
affected by these canons<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ibid. cap. 2.</NOTE>.
The King died before the canons received the royal sanction. Sir John
Sharington, whose crimes and malversations had appeared so egregious at
the condemnation of lord Seymour, obtained a reversal of his attainder<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Ibid. c. 13.</NOTE>. This man sought favour with the most
zealous of the reformers; and bishop Latimer asserted, that tho' formerly
he was a most notorious knave, he was now so penitent, that he had become a
very honest man.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1550" UNIT="year"/> WHEN Warwic and the council of
regency began to exercise their power, they found themselves involved in
the same difficulties which had embarrassed the protector. The wars with
France and Scotland could not be supported by an<NOTE PLACE="marg">Peace with
France and Sco<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>land.</NOTE>exhausted exchequer, seemed dangerous to a divided
nation, and were now ac¦knowleged not to have any object, which even the
greatest and most uninterrupted success could attain. The project of
peace which Somerset entertained, had served them as a pretence of clamour
against his administration; yet after sending Sir Tho∣mas Cheney to the
emperor, and making again a fruitless effort to engage him in the protection
of Boulog<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, they found
themselves obliged to listen to the ad∣vances which Henry made them, by
means of Guidotti, a Florentine merchant. <PB N="330" REF="335"/> The earl of
Bedford, Sir John Mason, Paget, and Petre, were sent over to Bou∣logne,
with full powers to negociate. The French King absolutely refused to pay
the two millions of crowns which his predecessor had acknowleged to be due
to the crown of England, as arrears of pensions; and said, that he never
would con∣sent to render himself tributary to any prince: But he offered a
sum for the im∣mediate<NOTE PLACE="marg">Boulogne

crowns were at last agreed on, one half to be paid immediately, the other in
August following.<NOTE PLACE="marg">24 March.</NOTE>Six hostages were given
for the performance of this article. Scotland was com∣prehended in the treaty:
The English stipulated to restore Lauder and Dunglas, and to demolish
the fortresses of Roxburgh and Eymouth<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Burnet▪
vol. II. p. 148. Heyward, 310, 311, 112. Rymer, vol. XV. p. 211.</NOTE>. No
sooner was peace concluded with France, than a project was entertained of a
close union with that kingdom; and Henry very willingly embraced a proposal
so suitable both to his interest and inclination. An agreement,
sometime after, was formed for a marriage between Edward and Elizabeth, a
daughter of France; and all the articles were, after a little negociation,
fully settled<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Hey∣ward, p. 318. Heylin, p.
104. Rymer, tom. XV. p. 293.</NOTE>: But this project ne∣ver took effect.</P>
<P>THE intention of marrying the King to a daughter of Henry, who
was a vio∣lent persecutor of the protestants, was no wise acceptable to
that party in Eng∣land: But, in all other respects, the council was very
steady in promoting the reformation, and in enforcing the laws against the
Romanists. Many of the prelates were still addicted to that communion; and
tho' they made some com∣pliances, in order to save their bishoprics, they
retarded, as much as they safely could, the execution of the new laws, and
gave countenance to such as were ne∣gligent or refractory. A resolution was
therefore taken to seek pretences for depriving them; and the execution of
this intention was the more easy, that they had all of them been obliged to
take commissions, in which it was declared, that they held their sees
only during the King's pleasure. It was thought proper to<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prosecution of Gardiner.</NOTE>begin with Gardiner, in order to
strike a terror into the rest. The method of proceeding against him was
extremely violent, and had scarce any colour of law or justice. It had been
prescribed him, to inculcate in a sermon, the duty of obedience to a King
even during his minority; and because he had neglected this topic, he had
been thrown into prison, and had been there detained during two years,
without being accused of any crime, except disobedience to this arbitrary
command. The duke of Somerset, secretary Petre, and some others of the
council, were now sent, in order to try his temper, and endeavour to find
some <PB N="331" REF="336"/> ground for depriving him: He professed to
them his intention of conforming to the government, of supporting the King's
laws, and of officiating by the new liturgy. This was not the disposition
which they expected or desired<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Heylin, p.
90.</NOTE>: A new deputation was therefore sent, who carried him several
articles to subscribe. He was to acknowlege his former misbehaviour, and
confess the justice of his confinement: He was likewise to own, that the
King was supreme head of the church; that the power of making and
dispensing with holidays, was part of the prerogative; that the
common-prayer book was a godly and commendable form; that the King was a
compleat sovereign in his minority; that the act of the six articles was
justly repealed; and that the King had full authority to cor∣rect and reform
what was amiss in ecclesiastical discipline, government, or doc∣trine.
The bishop was willing to put his hand to all the articles except the
first: He maintained his conduct to have been inoffensive; and declared,
that he would not own himself guilty of faults which he had never
committed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Collier, vol. II. p. 305. from the council
books. Heylin, p. 99.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE council, finding that he had gone such lengths, were
determined to pre∣vent his full compliance, by multiplying the difficulties
upon him, and sending him new articles to subscribe. A list was
selected of such points as they thought would be most hard of
digestion; and not content with these, they insisted still on his
submission, and an acknowlegement of past errors. To make this
subscription more mortifying, they required a promise, that he would
recom∣mend and publish all these articles from the pulpit: But Gardiner,
who saw, that they intended either to ruin or dishonour him, or perhaps
both, was deter∣mined not to gratify his enemies by any farther compliances: He
still insisted on his innocence; desired a fair trial; and refused to
subscribe more articles, till he should recover his liberty. For this
pretended offence his bishopric was put under sequestration for three
months; and as he then appeared no more com∣pliant than at first, a
commission was appointed to try, or, more properly speak∣ing, to condemn
him. <MILESTONE N="1551" UNIT="year"/> The commissioners were, the primate,
the bishops of London, Ely, and Lin oln, secretary Petre, Sir James Hales,
and some other lawyers. Gardiner objected to the legality of the
commission, which was not founded on any statute or precedent; and he
appealed from the commissioners to the King. His appeal was not regarded:
Sentence was pronounced against him: He was deprived of his bishopric: And
committed to close custody: His books and papers were seized: All company
was denied him; and it was not allowed him either to send or receive any
letters or messages<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> vol. II. p. 734, &amp; seq. Burnet, Heylin,
Collier.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="332" REF="337"/> GARDINER, as well as the other prelates,
had agreed to hold his office during the King's pleasure: But the council,
unwilling to make use of a concession which had been so illegally and
arbitrarily exacted, chose rather to employ some forms of justice; a
resolution, which led them to commit still greater iniquities and
severities. But the violence of the reformers did not stop there. Day,
bi∣shop of Chichester, Heathe of Worcester, and Voisey of Exeter, were
deprived of their bishoprics, under pretence of disobedience. Even Kitchen
of Landaff, Capon of Salisbury, and Sampson of Coventry, tho' they had
complied in every thing, yet not being supposed cordial or hearty in their
obedience, were obliged to seek protection, by sacrificing the most
considerable revenues of their see, to the rapacious courtiers<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Goodwin de praesul. Angl. Heylin, p. 100.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THESE plunderers of the church neglected not even smaller
profits. An or∣der was issued by council, for purging the library of
Westminster of all missals, legends, and other superstitious
volumes, and delivering their garniture to Sir Anthony Aucher<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Collier, vol. II. p. 307. from the coun∣cil books.</NOTE>. Many of
these books were plaited with gold and silver, and curiously
embossed; and this finery was probably the superstition that
destroyed them. Great havoc was likewise made on the libraries of Oxford.
Books and manuscripts were destroyed without distinction: The volumes of
di∣vinity suffered for their rich binding: Those of literature were
condemned as useless: Those of geometry and astronomy were supposed
to contain nothing but necromancy<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Wood▪
Hist. &amp; Antiq▪ Oxon. lib. 1. p. 271, 272.</NOTE>. The university
had not power to oppose these barbarous vio∣lences: They were in danger of
losing their own revenues; and expected every moment to be swallowed up by
the earl of Warwic and his associates.</P>
<P>THO' every thing yielded to the authority of the council, the
lady Mary could never be brought to compliance; and she still continued to
adhere to the mass, and to reject the new liturgy. Her behaviour was, during
some time, connived at; but, at last, her two chaplains, Mallet and
Berkeley, were thrown into pri∣son<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Strype, vol.
II▪ p. 249.</NOTE>; and the princess was remonstrated with for her
disobedience. The coun∣cil wrote her a letter, where they endeavoured to make
her change her senti∣ments, and to persuade her, that her religious faith
was very ill grounded. They asked her, what warrant there was in scripture
for prayers in an unknown tongue, the use of images, or offering up the
sacrament for the dead; and they desired her to peruse St. Austin, and
the other ancient doctors, who would convince her of the errors of the Romish
superstition, and prove that it was founded merely on false miracles and
lying stories<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Fox, vol. II▪ Collier,
Burnet.</NOTE>. The lady Mary remained obstinate against 
<PB N="333" REF="338"/> all this advice, and protested herself willing to
endure death rather than relin∣quish her religion: She only feared, she
said, that she was not worthy to suffer in so holy a cause: And as
for protestant books, she thanked God, that, as she never had, so she
hoped never to read any of them. Dreading farther violence, she endeavoured
to make her escape to her kinsman Charles; but her design was
discovered and prevented<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Heyward, p. 315.</NOTE>. The
emperor remonstrated in her behalf, and even threatned hostilities, if
liberty of conscience was refused her: But tho' the coun∣cil, sensible
that the kingdom was in no condition to support, with honour, such a war,
was desirous to comply; they found great difficulty to overcome the
scru∣ples of the young King. He had been educated in such a violent
abhorrence of the mass, and other popish rites, which he regarded as
impious and idolatrous, that he should participate, he thought, in the sin,
if he allowed its commission: And when at last the imp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rtunity of Cranmer, Ridley, and Poinet,
prevailed somewhat over his opposition, he burst into tears, lamenting
his sister's obstinacy, and bewailing his own fate, that he must
suffer her to continue in such an abomi∣nable mode of worship.</P>
<P>THE great object, at this time, of antipathy among the
protestant sects, was popery, or, more properly speaking, the papists.
These they regarded as the common enemy, who threatened every moment to
overwhelm the evangelical faith, and destroy its partizans by fire and
sword: They had not as yet had lei∣sure to attend to the other minute
divisions among themselves, which afterwards became the object of such
furious quarrels and animosities, and threw the whole kingdom into
confusion. Several Lutheran divines, who had reputation in those days,
Bucer, Peter Martyr, and others, were engaged to take shelter in Eng∣land,
from the persecutions which the emperor exercised in Germany; and they
received protection and encouragement. John A-lasco, a nobleman, uncle to the
King of Poland<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Fox, vol. III. p. 40.</NOTE>,
being expelled his country by the rigours of the catholics, settled, during
some time, at Embden in East-Friezland, where he became preacher to a
congregation of the reformed. Foreseeing the persecutions which ensued,
he removed to England, and brought his congregation along with him. The
council, who regarded them as industrious, useful people, and desired to
invite over others of the same character, not only gave them Augustine
friars church for the exercise of their religion, but granted them a charter,
by which they were erected into a corporation, consisting of a
super-intendant and four assisting ministers. This ecclesiastical
establishment was quite independant of the church of England, and differed
from it in some rites and ceremonies<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Mem.
Cranm. p. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="334" REF="339"/> THESE differences among the protestants
were matter of triumph to the catho∣lics, who insisted, that the moment men
departed from the authority of the church, they lost all criterion of truth
and falsehood in matters of religion, and must be carried away by every
wind of doctrine. The continual variations of every sect of protestants,
afforded them the same topic of reasoning. The book of common prayer
suffered in England a new revisal, and some rites and ceremo∣nies, which
had given offence, were omitted<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mem. Cranm. p.
289.</NOTE>. The speculative doctrines, or the metaphysics of the religion,
were also fixed in forty two articles. These articles were intended to
obviate further divisions and variations; and the framing them had been
postponed till the establishment of the liturgy, which was regarded as a
more material object to the people. The eternity of hell-torments is
as∣sorted in the articles; and care is also taken to inculcate, not only
that no hea∣then, however virtuous, can escape an endless state of the
most exquisite misery, but also that every one who presumes to
maintain, that any pagan can possibly be saved, is himself exposed to
the penalty of eternal perdition<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Article
xviii.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE theological zeal of the council, tho' seemingly fervent,
went not so far as to make them neglect their own temporal concerns, which
seem to have been ever uppermost in their thoughts: They even found
leisure to attend to the pub∣lic interest; nay, to the commerce of the
nation, which was, at that time, very little the object of general study or
attention. The trade of England had anci∣ently been carried on altogether by
foreigners, chiefly the inhabitants of the Hanse-towns, or Easterlings, as
they were called; and in order to encourage these merchants to settle in
England, they had been erected into a corporation by Henry the third, had
obtained a patent, were endowed with privileges, and were exempted from
several heavy duties paid by aliens. So ignorant were the English of
commerce, that this company, commonly denominated the merchants of the
Steel-yard, engrossed almost the who'e foreign trade of the kingdom; and
as they naturally employed the shipping of their own country, the naviga∣tion
of England was also in a very languishing condition. It was therefore
thought proper by the council to find pretences for annulling the privileges of
this corporation, privileges which put them nearly on an equal footing with
Eng∣lishmen in the duties which they paid; and as such patents were, during
that are granted by the absolute power of the King, men were the less
surprized to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> them recalled
by the same authority. Several remonstrances were made against this
innovation, by Lubec, Hamburgh, and other Hanse towns; but the coun∣cil
persevered in their resolution, and the good effects of it became soon
visible to the nation. The English, by their very situation as na<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ives, had advantages 
<PB N="335" REF="340"/> above foreigners in the purchase of cloth, wool, and
other commodities; tho' these advantages had not been sufficient to rouze
their industry, or engage them to become rivals to this opulent company: But
when aliens duty was also im∣posed upon all foreigners indiscriminately,
the English were tempted to enter into commerce, and a spirit of industry
began to appear in the kingdom<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Heyward, p. 326. Heylin,
p. 108. Strype's Memorials, vol. II. p. 295.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>ABOUT the same time a treaty was made with Gustavus
Ericson, King of Sweden, by which it was stipulated, that if he sent
bullion into England, he might carry away English commodities without paying
custom, that he should carry bullion to no other prince, that if he sent
ozimus, steel, copper, &amp;c. he should pay custom for English
commodities as an Englishman, and that if he sent other merchandize, he
should have free intercourse, paying custom as a stranger<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Heylin. p. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>.</NOTE>. The bullion sent over by Sweden set the mint to work:
Good specie was coined: And much of the base metal, formerly issued,
was recalled: A circumstance which tended extremely to the encouragement of
commerce.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Warwic cre∣ated duke of
Northumber∣land.</NOTE> BUT all these schemes for the improvement of
industry were like to prove abor∣tive, by the fear of domestic
convulsions, arising from the exorbitant ambition of Warwic. That nobleman,
not contented with the station which he had at∣tained, carried farther his
pretensions, and had gained to himself partizans who were disposed to
second him in every enterprize. The last earl of Northumber∣land died
without issue; and as Sir Thomas Piercy, his brother, had been at∣tainted
on account of the share which he had in the Yorkshire insurrection during
the late reign, the title was at present extinct, and the estate was
vested in the crown. Warwic now procured to himself a grant of those
ample possessions, which lay chiefly in the North, the most warlike
part of the kingdom; and he was dignified with the title of duke of
Northumberland. His friend, Paulet, lord St. John, the treasurer, was created
first earl of Wiltshire, then marquess of Winchester; Sir William
Herbert was made earl of Pembroke.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">His ambition.</NOTE> BUT the ambition of
Northumberland made him regard all increase of pos∣sessions and
titles, either to himself or partizans, as steps only to further
acqui∣sitions. Finding that Somerset, tho' degraded from his dignity, and
even les∣sened in the public opinion by his spiritless conduct, still
enjoyed a considerable share of popularity, he was determined to ruin a man
whom he regarded as the chief obstacle to the attainment of his hopes. The
alliance which had been formed between the families had produced no cordial
union, and only enabled Northumberland to compass with more certainty the
destruction of his rival. He secretly gained many of the friends and
servants of that unhappy nobleman: <PB N="336" REF="341"/> He sometimes
terrified him by the appearance of danger: Sometimes provoked him by ill
usage. The unguarded Somerset often broke out into menacing
ex∣pressions against Northumberland: At other times, he formed rash
projects, which he immediately abandoned: His treacherous confidents carried to
his enemy every passionate word which dropped from him: They revealed the
schemes, which they themselves had first suggested<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Heylin, p. 112.</NOTE>: And Northumberland, thinking that the
proper season was now come, began to act in an open manner against
him.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">16th October.</NOTE> IN one night, the duke
of Somerset, the lord Grey, David and John Seymour, Hammond and Neudigate,
two of the duke's servants, Sir Ralph Vane and Sir Thomas Palmer were
arrested and committed to custody. Next day, the dutchess of Somerset,
with her favourites, Crane and his wife, Sir Miles Partridge, Sir Michael
Stanhope, Bannister, and others were thrown into prison. Sir Thomas Palmer,
who had all along acted the part of a spy upon Somerset, accused him of
having formed a design to raise an insurrection in the north, to attack
the gens d'armes on a muster-day, to secure the Tower, and to excite a
rebellion in London: But what was the only probable accusation, he
asserted, that Somerset had once laid a project for murdering
Northumberland, Northampton, and Pem∣broke at a banquet, which was to be given
them by lord Paget. Crane and his wife confirmed Palmer's testimony with
regard to this last design; and it appears that some rash scheme of
that nature had been mentioned; tho' no regular conspiracy had been formed,
nor means prepared for its execution. Hammond confessed, that the duke had
armed men to guard him one night in his house at Greenwich.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Trial of So∣merset.</NOTE> SOMERSET was
brought to his trial before the marquis of Winchester, who acted as high
steward. Twenty-seven peers sat as the jury, among whom were
Northumberland, Pembroke, and Northampton, whom decency should have hindered

enemy. Somerset was accused of high treason on account of the pro∣jected
insurrections, and of felony in forming a design to murder privy
coun∣sellors.</P>
<P>WE have a very imperfect account of all state trials during
that age, which is a sensible defect in our history: But it appears, that
some more regularity was observed in the management of this prosecution

lame with <PB N="337" REF="342"/> regard to the treasonable part of the
charge; and Somerset's defence was so satis∣factory, that the peers
gave verdict in his favour: The intention alone of assaulting the privy
counsellors was supported by any tolerable evidence; and the jury brought
him in guilty of felony. The prisoner himself confessed, that he had
mentioned the design of murdering Northumberland and the other lords; but had
not formed any resolution on that head: And when he received sentence, he
asked pardon of those peers for the designs which he had hearkened to
against them. The people, by whom Somerset was beloved, hearing the first
part of his sen∣tence, by which he was absolved from treason,
expressed their joy by loud accla∣mations: But their satisfaction was

series of occupations and amusements. At last the prisoner was brought
to the scaffold<NOTE PLACE="marg">His execu∣tion.</NOTE>on Tower-hill,
amidst great crouds of spectators, who bore him such sincere
kindness, that they entertained, to the last moment, the fond hopes of his
par∣don<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Hayward, p. 324, 325.</NOTE>.<NOTE PLACE="marg">22d
January.</NOTE>Many of them rushed in to dip their handkerchiefs in his
blood, which they long preserved as a precious relict; and some of them
soon after, when Nor∣thumberland met with a like doom, upbraided him with
this cruelty, and dis∣played to him these symbols of his crime.
Somerset indeed, tho' many actions of his life were very exceptionable,
seems, in general, to have merited a better fate; and the faults, which he
committed, were owing to weakness, not to any bad intentions. His virtues
were better calculated for private than for public life; and by his want of
penetration and firmness, he was ill-fitted to extricate him∣self from
those cabals and violences to which that age was so much addicted. Sir
Thomas Arundel, Sir Michael Stanhope, Sir Miles Partridge, and Sir Ralph Vane,
all of them Somerset's friends, were brought to their trial, condemned and
executed: Great injustice seems to have been used in their prosecution.
Lord Paget, chancellor of the dutchy, was, on some pretence, tried in the
Star-cham∣ber, and condemned in a fine of 6000 pounds, with the loss of his
office. To mortify him the more, he was degraded from the order of the garter;
as un∣worthy, on account of his mean birth, to share that honour<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Stowe, p.
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>08.</NOTE>. Lord Rich, chancellor,
was also compelled to resign his office, on the discovery of some
friendship, which he had shown to Somerset.</P>
<P><PB N="338" REF="343"/> THE day after the execution of
Somerset, a session of Parliament was held,<NOTE PLACE="marg">23d
January. A Parliament.</NOTE>where farther advances were made for the
establishment of the reformation. The new liturgy was authorised; and
penalties were enacted against all such as absented themselves from
public worship<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">5 &amp; 6 Edw. VI.
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. 1.</NOTE>. To use the mass
had already been prohibited under very severe penalties; so that the
reformers, it appears, whatever scope they had given to their own private
judgment, in disputing the tenets of the antient religion, were resolved
not to allow the same privilege to others; and the practice, nay the very
doctrine of toleration, was, at that time, equally unknown to all sects and
parties. To dissent from the religion of the magistrate was universally
conceived to be as criminal as to question his title, or rebel against his
authority.</P>
<P>A LAW was enacted against usury; that is, against taking
any interest for money<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ib
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> 20.</NOTE>. This act was the
effect of antient superstitions; but being found ex∣tremely iniquitous in
itself, as well as prejudicial to commerce, it was after∣wards repealed in
the twelfth of Elizabeth. The common rate of interest, not∣withstanding the
law, was at that time 14 per cent<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Hayward, p.
318.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>A BILL was introduced by the ministry into the house of
lords, renewing those rigorous statutes of treasons, which had been
abrogated in the beginning of this reign; and tho' the peers, by their high
station, stood most exposed to these tempests of state, yet had
they so little regard to public authority, or even to their own true
interests, that they passed the bill with only one dissenting
voice<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Paliamentary Hist. vol. III p. 258.
Burnet, vol. II. p. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>0.</NOTE>.
But the commons rejected it, and prepared a new bill, that passed into a
law, by which it was enacted, that whoever should call the King or any of his
heirs, named in the statute of the 35th of the last reign, heretic,
schismatic, tyrant, infidel, or usurper of the crown, should forfeit,
for the first offence, their goods and chattels, and be imprisoned during
pleasure; for the second, should be in a <HI>praemunire;</HI> for the
third, should be attainted of treason. But if any should un∣advisedly
advance such a slander in writing, printing, painting, carving or grav∣ing,
he was, for the first offence, to be held a traitor<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">5 &amp; 6 Edw. VI. cap. 2.</NOTE>. It may be worthy of notice,
that the King and his next heir, the lady Mary, were professedly of
dif∣ferent religions; and religions, which threw on each other the imputation
of heresy, schism, idolatry, prophaneness, blasphemy, wickedness,
and all the op∣probrious epithets, that religious zeal has invented. It was
almost impossible, therefore, for the people, if they spoke on these
subjects at all, not to fall into the crime, so severely punished by
this statute; and the jealousy of the commons <PB N="339" REF="344"/> for
liberty, tho' it led them to dissent from the lords, appears not to have
been very active, vigilant or clear-sighted.</P>
<P>THE commons annexed to this bill a clause which was of much
more impor∣tance than the bill itself, that no one should be convicted of
any kind of treason, unless the crime was proved by the oaths of two
witnesses, who were confronted with the prisoner. The lords scrupled to
pass this clause; tho' required by the most obvious principles of equity,
and tho' their own interest was fully as much concerned as that of the
commons. But the members of that house trusted for protection to their
present personal interest and power, and neglected the noblest and
most permanent security, that of the laws.</P>
<P>A BILL was introduced into the house of peers for making a
provision for the poor; but the commons, not chusing that a money-bill
should begin in the upper∣house, framed a new bill to the same purpose.
By this bill, the church-wardens were empowered to collect charitable
contributions for the poor, and if any re∣fused to contribute, or
disswaded others from that charity, the bishop of the dio∣cese was
empowered to proceed against them. Such a large discretionary power,
entrusted to the prelates, seems as proper an object of jealousy as the
authority assumed by the peers<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">5 &amp; 6 Edw.
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>I. cap. 3.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THERE was another occasion in which the Parliament reposed
an unusual confidence in the bishops. They empowered them to proceed
against such as neglected the Sundays and holydays<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ib. cap. 3.</NOTE>. But these were unguarded concessions
granted to the church: The general humour of the times led men to bereave the
ecclesiastics of all their power, and even to pillage them of all their
property: Many clergymen were obliged for a subsistance to turn
carpenters or taylors, and some kept alehouses<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. II. p.
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</NOTE>. The bishops
themselves were generally reduced to po∣verty, and held both their revenues
and spiritual office by a very precarious and uncertain tenure.</P>
<P>TONSTAL, bishop of Durham, was one of the most eminent
prelates of that age, still less for the dignity of his see, than for his
own personal merit, his learning, moderation, humanity, and benesicence. He
had opposed, by his vote and authority, all the innovations in religion; but
so soon as they were enacted, he had always submitted, and had paid
conformity to each system of religion, which was established. The known
probity of his mind had made this compli∣ance be ascribed, not to an
interested or time serving spirit, but to a sense of duty, which led
him to think that all private opinions ought to be sacrificed to the great
concerns of public peace and tranquillity. That general regard which 
<PB N="340" REF="345"/> was paid his character, had preserved him from any
severe treatment during the protectorship of Somerset; but when
Northumberland gained the ascendant, he was thrown into prison; and as that
rapacious nobleman had formed a design of appropriating the revenues of the
see of Durham, and of forming to himself a principality in the northern
counties, he was resolved, in order to effectuate his purpose, to deprive
Tonstal of his bishopric. A bill of attainder, therefore, under pretence of
misprision of treason, was introduced into the house of peers against
that prelate; and it passed with the opposition only of lord Stourt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n, a zealous catholic, and of Cranmer,
who always bore a cordial and sincere friend∣ship to the bishop of
Durham. But when the bill was sent down to the commons, they required that
witnesses should be examined, that Tonstal should be allowed to
defend himself, and that he should be confronted with his accusers: And
when these demands were refused, they rejected the bill.</P>
<P>THIS equity, so unusual in the Parliament during that age,
was ascribed by Northumberland and his partizans, not to any regard for
liberty and justice, but to the prevalence of Somerset's faction in a
house of commons, which, being chosen during the administration of that
nobleman, had been almost entirely filled with his creatures. They were
confirmed in this opinion, when they sound, that a bill confirming the
attainder of Somerset and his complices was also rejected by the commons,
tho' it had passed the upper house. A resolution was<NOTE PLACE="marg">15th April.</NOTE>therefore taken to dissolve the Parliament,
which had sat during this whole reign; and soon after to summon a new
one.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A new Parlia∣ment.</NOTE> NORTHUMBERLAND, in
order to ensure to himself a house of commons entirely obsequious to
his will, ventured on an expedient which could not have been practised, or
even thought of, in an age, when there was any idea or compre∣hension of
liberty. He engaged the King to write circular letters to all the sheriffs,
in which he enjoined them to inform the freeholders and voters, that they were
required to choose men of knowledge and experience for their
repre∣sentatives. After this general exhortation, the King continued in
these words. 
<Q REND="inline">"And yet, nevertheless, our pleasure is,
that where our privy council, or any of them shall, in our behalf, recommend,
within their jurisdiction, men of learn∣ing and wisdom; in such cases,
their directions shall be regarded and followed, as tending to the same end
which we desire, that is, to have this assembly composed of the pers
ns in our realm the best sitted to give advice and good council<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Strype's Eccles. Memorials, vol. II. p. 391.</NOTE>."</Q>
Several letters were sent from the King, recommending members to particular
counties, Sir Richard Cotton for Hampshire; Sir William Fitz∣williams and Sir
Henry Neville for Berkshire; Sir William Drury and Sir Henry 
<PB N="341" REF="346"/> Benningfield for Suffolk, &amp;c. But tho' some
counties only received this species of <HI>congé d'elire</HI> from the
King; the recommendations from the privy council and the councellors, we may
fairly presume, would extend to the greatest part, if not to the whole, of
the kingdom.</P>
<P>IT is remarkable, that this attempt was made during the reign of
a minor King, when the royal authority is usually weakest; that it was
patiently sub∣mitted to; and that it gave so little umbrage as scarce to
be taken notice of by any historian. The painful and laborious collector
above cited, who never omits the most trivial matters, is the only person,
that has thought this memo∣rable letter worthy of being transmitted to
posterity.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1553" UNIT="year"/> THE Parliament answered
Northumberland's expectations. As Tonstal had in the interval been deprived
of his bishopric after a very arbitrary manner, by the<NOTE PLACE="marg">1st March.</NOTE>sentence of lay commissioners, appointed
to try him, the see of Durham was by act of Parliament divided into two
bishoprics, which had certain portions of the revenue assigned them. The
regalities of the see, which included the jurisdiction of a count palatine,
were given by the King to Northumberland; and it was not to be doubted but that
nobleman had also proposed to make rich plunder of the revenue, as was then
the usual practice of the courtiers, whenever a bishopric fell vacant.</P>
<P>THE commons gave the ministry another mark of attachment,
which was at that time the most sincere, the most cordial, and the most
difficult to be obtained: They granted a supply of two subsidies and two
fifteenths. To render this pre∣sent the more acceptable, they voted a
preamble, containing a long accusation of Somerset, 
<Q REND="inline">"for involving the King in wars, wasting his
treasure, ingaging him in much debt, embasing the coin, and giving
occasion for a most terrible rebellion<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">7 Edw. VI.

<P>THE debts of the crown were at this time very considerable.
The King had received from France 400,000 crowns on delivering Boulogne; he had
reaped profits from the sale of some chantry lands; the churches had been
despoiled of all their plate and rich ornaments, which, by a decree of
council, without any pretence of law or equity, had been converted to the
King's use<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Heylin, p.
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></NOTE>: Yet such had been
the rapacity of the courtiers, that the crown was indebted about 300,000
pounds<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Strype's Eccles. Mem. vol. II. p.
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>14.</NOTE>; and great depredations
were, at the same time, made of the royal demesnes. The young prince
showed, among other virtues, a disposition to frugality, which, had he
lived, would soon have retrieved these losses: But as his health was
declining very fast, the present emptiness of the exchequer was a 
<PB N="342" REF="347"/> sensible obstacle to the execution of those
projects, which the ambition of North∣umberland had founded on the prospect
of Edward's approaching end.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Succession changed.</NOTE> THAT nobleman
represented to the prince, whom youth and an infirm state of health made
susceptible of every impression, that his two sisters, Mary and
Eli∣zabeth, had both been declared illegitimate by act of Parliament, and tho'
Henry by his will had restored them to a place in the succession, the
nation would never bear to see the throne of England filled by a bastard:
That they were only the King's sisters by the half-blood; and even if they
were legitimate, could not enjoy the crown as his heirs and successors:
That the Queen of Scots stood excluded by the king's will; and being an
alien, lost all right of inheriting by the law; not to mention, that, as
she was betrothed to the dauphin, she would, by her succession,
render England, as she had already done Scotland, a province to France: That
the certain consequence of his sister Mary's succession, or that of
the Queen of Scots, was the abolition of the protestant religion, the repeal
of those laws enacted in favour of the reformation, and the
re-establishment of the usurpations and idolatry of the church of Rome:
That fortunately for England, the same order of succession, which
justice required, was also the most conform∣able to public interest;
and there was not on any side any just ground for doubt or deliberation:
That when these three princesses were excluded by such solid
reasons, the succession devolved to the marchioness of Dorset,
eldest daughter to the French Queen and the duke of Suffolk: That the next
heir of the marchio∣ness was the lady Jane Gray, a lady of the most amiable
virtue, accomplished by the best education, both for literature and for
religion; and every way worthy of a throne: And that even, if her title by
blood should be doubtful, which there was no just reason to pretend, the
King was possessed of the same power, which his father enjoyed; and
might leave her the crown by letters patent. These reasonings made
impression on the young prince; and above all, his zea∣lous affection for
the protestant religion made him apprehend the consequences, if so
bigotted a catholic as his sister Mary should succeed to the throne.
And tho' he bore a tender affection to the lady Elizabeth, who was liable to no
such objection, means were found to perswade him, that he could not exclude
the one sister, on account of illegitimacy, without also giving an
exclusion to the other.</P>
<P>NORTHUMBERLAND, finding that his arguments were likely to
operate on the King, began to prepare the other parts of that political fabric,
which he in∣tended to raise. Two sons of the duke of Suffolk by a second
venter having died, this season, of the sweating sickness, that title
was extinct; and Northum∣berland engaged the King to bestow it on the marquis
of Dorset. By means of <PB N="343" REF="348"/> this favour and of others,
which he conferred upon him, he persuaded the new duke of Suffolk and the
dutchess, to give their daughter, the lady Jane, in marriage to his fourth
son, the lord Guilford Dudley. In order to fortify himself by farther
alliances, he negotiated a marriage between the lady Catherine Gray, second
daughter to Suffolk, and lord Herbert, eldest son to the earl of Pembroke.
He also married his own daughter to lord Hastings, eldest son to the
earl of Huntingdon<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Heylin, p. 109. Stowe, 609.</NOTE>.
These marriages were solemnized with great pomp and festivity; and the
people, who hated Northumberland, could not forbear expressing their
indignation at seeing these public demonstrations of joy, during the
languishing state of the young prince's health.</P>
<P>EDWARD had been seized in the foregoing year, first with the
measles, then with the small pox; but having perfectly recovered both
these distempers, the nation entertained hopes, that they would only
serve to confirm his health; and he had afterwards made a progress thro'
some parts of the kingdom. It was suspected, that he had there
over-heated himself in exercises: He was seized with a cough,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King's sicknets.</NOTE>which proved obstinate, and gave
way neither to regimen nor medicines: Seve∣ral fatal symptoms of a
consumption appeared; and tho' it was hoped, that, as the season of the
year advanced, his youth and temperance might get the better of the malady, men
saw with great concern his bloom and vigour insensibly de∣cay. The
general attachment to the young prince, joined to the hatred borne the Dudleys,
made it be remarked, that Edward had every moment declined in health, from the
time that lord Robert Dudley had been put about him, in the quality of
gentleman of the bedchamber.</P>
<P>THE languishing state of Edward's health made Northumberland
the more in∣tent on the execution of his project. He removed all, except his
own emissaries, from about the King: He himself attended him with the
greatest assiduity: He pretended the most anxious concern for his
health and welfare: And by all these artifices, he prevailed on him to give
his final consent to the settlement projected. Sir Edward Montague, chief
justice of the Common Pleas, Sir John Baker and Sir Thomas Bromley, two
judges, with the attorney and sollicitor general were sent for to the
council; where, after the minutes of the intended deed were
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ad to them, the King required them
to d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> them up in the form of
letters patent. They hesitated in obeying this order; and desired time to
consider of it. The more they reflected, the greater dang<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> they sound in compliance. The
settlement of the crown by Henry the eighth had been made in consequence of
an art of Parliament; and by another act, passed in the beginning of this
reign, it was declared treason in any of the heirs, their aiders or abettors,
to attempt on the <PB N="344" REF="349"/> right of another, or change the order
of succession. The judges pleaded these reasons before the council.
They urged, that such a patent as was intended would be entirely invalid;
that it would subject, not only the judges who drew it, but every
counsellor who signed it, to the pains of treason; and that the only
proper expedient, both to give force to the new settlement, and free its
partizans from danger, was to summon a Parliament, and obtain the consent
and sanction of that assembly. The King said, that he intended
afterwards to follow that method, and would call a Parliament, in which he
proposed to have his settlement ratified; but in the mean time, he required
the judges, on their allegiance, to draw the patent in the form required. The
council told the judges, that their refusal would subject them all to the
pains of treason. Northumberland gave to Mon∣tague the appellation of
traitor; and said that he would fight in his shirt with any man in so
just a quarrel as that of the lady Jane's succession. The judges were
reduced to great difficulties between the dangers of the law, and those
aris∣ing from the violence of present power and authority<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Fuller, book VIII. p. 2.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE arguments were canvassed in several different meetings
between the council and the judges; and no solution could be found of the
present difficulties. At last, Montague proposed an expedient, which
satisfied both his brethren and the counsellors. He desired, that a
special commission should be passed by the King and council,
requiring the judges to draw a patent for the new settlement of the crown;
and that a pardon should immediately after be granted them for any offence
which they might have committed by their compliance. When the pa∣tent was drawn
and brought to the bishop of Ely, chancellor, in order to pass the great
seal, that prelate required, that all the judges should sign it.
Gosnald at first refused; and it was with much difficulty, that he was
prevailed on, by the violent menaces of Northumberland, to comply; but the
constancy of Sir James Hales, who, tho' a zealous protestant, preferred
justice on this occasion to the prejudices of his party, could not be
shaken by any expedient. The chan∣cellor next required, for his greater
security, that all the privy councellors should set their hands to the
patent: The intrigues of Northumberland or the fears of his vio∣lence<NOTE PLACE="marg">21st June.</NOTE>were so prevalent, that the counsellors
complied with this demand. Cranmer alone hesitated during some time, but
yielded at last to the earnest and pathetic entreaties of the King<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>anm.
Mem. p. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</NOTE>. Cecil, at
that time secretary of state, pretended alter∣wards that he only signed
as a witness to the King's subscription. And thus, by the King's letters
patent, the two princesses, Mary and Elizabeth, were set aside; and the
crown was settled on the heirs of the dutchess of Suffolk: For the
dutchess herself was content to be postponed to her daughters.</P>
<P><PB N="345" REF="350"/> AFTER this settlement was made, with
so many inauspicious circumstances, Edward declined visibly every day
in his health; and small hopes were entertained of his recovery. To make the
matter worse, his physicians were dismissed by Northumberland's
advice and by an order of council; and he was put into the hands of an ignorant
woman, who undertook, in a little time, to restore him to his former state
of health. After the use of her medicines, all the bad symp∣toms
encreased to the most violent degree: He felt a difficulty of speech and
breathing; his pulse failed, his legs swelled, his colour became livid; and
many<NOTE PLACE="marg">And death▪ 6th July.</NOTE>other symptoms
appeared of his approaching end. He expired at Greenwich in the sixteenth
year of his age, and the seventh of his reign.</P>
<P>ALL the English historians dwell with pleasure on the
excellencies of this young prince; whom the flattering promises of hope,
joined to many real virtues, had made an object of the most tender affections
of the public. He possessed mild∣ness of disposition, application
to study and business, a capacity to learn and judge, and an attachment
to equity and justice. He seems only to have con∣tracted from his education
and from the age in which he lived, too much of a narrow prepossession
in matters of religion, which made him incline somewhat to bigotry and
persecution: But as the bigotry of protestants, less governed by
priests, lies under more restraints than that of catholics, the effects of
this ma∣lignant quality were the less to be apprehended, if a longer life had
been granted to young Edward.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE title of the princess Mary to the crown, after the
decease of her brother, was not liable to any considerable difficulty; and
the objections started by the lady Jane's partizans, were new and unheard-of
by the nation. Tho' all the protestants, and even many of the catholics,
believed the marriage of Henry the eighth with Catherine of Arragon to be
un∣lawful and invalid; yet as it had been contracted by the parties without any
criminal intention, had been avowed by their parents, recognized by the nation,
and seemed sounded on those principles of law and religion, which then
prevailed, very few imagined, that their issue ought on that account to be
regarded as ille∣gitimate. A declaration to that purpose had indeed been
extorted from the Par∣liament by the usual violence and caprice of Henry; but
as that monarch had afterwards been induced to restore his daughter to the
right of succession, her <PB N="348" REF="352"/> title was now become as
legal and parliamentary as it was ever esteemed just and natural. The
public had been long familiarized to these sentiments: During all the reign
of Edward, the princess was considered as his lawful successor: And
tho' the protestants dreaded the effects of her prejudices, the extreme
hatred, universally entertained against the Dudleys<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sleidan▪ lib. 25.</NOTE>, who, men foresaw, would, under
the name of Jane, be the real sovereigns, was more than sufficient to
counterbal∣lance, even with that party, the attachment to religion. This last
attempt, to violate the order of succession, had displayed
Northumberland's ambition and injustice in a full light; and when the people
reflected on the long train of fraud, iniquity and cruelty, by which that
project had been conducted; that the lives of the two Seymours, as well as the
title of the princesses, had been sacrificed to it; they were moved by
indignation to exert themselves in opposition to such criminal
enterprizes. The general veneration also, paid to the memory of Henry the
eighth, prompted the nation to defend the rights of his posterity; and the
miseries of the antient civil wars were not so entirely forgotten, that men
were willing, by a departure from the lawful heir, to incur the danger of the
like blood∣shed and confusion.</P>
<P>NORTHUMBERLAND, sensible of the opposition he must
expect, had carefully concealed the destination made by the King; and in
order to bring the two princesses into his power, he had had the precaution
to engage the council, before Edward's death, to write to them in that prince's
name, desiring their attendance, under pretext, that his infirm state of
health required the assistance of their counsel and the consolation
of their company<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Heylin, p. 154.</NOTE>. Edward
expired before their arrival; but Northumberland, in order to make the
princesses fall into the share, kept the King's death still secret;
and the lady Mary had already reached Hoddesden, within half a day's journey
of the court. Happily, the earl of Arundel sent her private intelligence,
both of her brother's death and of the conspiracy formed against her<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. II. p. 233.</NOTE>: She immediately made haste to
retire; and ar∣rived by quick journeys, first at Kenning-hall in Norfolk,
then at Framlingham in Suffolk; where she proposed to embark and retire to
Flanders, in case she should find it impossible to defend her right
of succession. She wrote letters to the nobility and most
considerable gentry in every county of England; com∣manding them to
assist her in the defence of her crown and person. And she
dis∣patched a message to the council; by which she notified to them,
that her brother's death was no longer a secret to her, promised them
pardon for past offences, and required them immediately to give orders for
proclaiming her title in London<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Fox, vol. III. p.
14.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="349" REF="353"/> NORTHUMBERLAND found that farther
dissimulation was vain: He went to Sion-house<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Thuanus, lib. xiii. c. 2.</NOTE>, accompanied with the duke of
Suffolk, the earl of Pembroke, and others of the nobility; and he approached
the lady Jane, who resided there, with all the respect usually paid to
the sovereign. Jane was, in a great measure,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lady Jane
Gray pro∣claimed Queen.</NOTE>ignorant of all these transactions; and it
was with equal grief and surprize, that she received intelligence of
them<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Godwin in Kennet, p. 329. Heylin, p. 149.
Burnet, vol. II. p. 234.</NOTE>. She was a lady of the most amiable person,
the most engaging disposition, the most accomplished parts; and being
of an equal age with the late King, she had received all her education with
him, and seemed even to possess a greater facility in acquiring every
part of manly and po∣lite literature. She had attained a knowlege of the Roman
and Greek languages, beside modern tongues; had passed most of her time
in an application to learning; and expressed a great indifference for other
occupations and amusements usual with her sex and station. Roger
Ascham, tutor to the lady Elizabeth, having at one time paid her a visit,
found her employed in the reading of Plato, while the rest of the family were
engaged in a party of hunting in the park; and upon his admiring the
singularity of her choice, she told him, that she received more
pleasure from that author than the others could reap from all their sport
and gaity. Her heart, full of this passion for literature and the elegant
arts, and of tenderness towards her husband, who was deserving of her
affection, had never opened itself to the flattering allurements of ambition;
and the information of her advancement to the throne was by no means agreeable
to her. She even re∣fused to accept the present; pleaded the preferable
right of the two princesses; expressed her dread of the consequences
attending an enterprize so dangerous, not to say so criminal; and
desired to remain in that private station in which she was born. Overcome
at last with the entreaties, rather than reasons, of her fa∣ther and
father-in-law, and above all of her husband, she submitted to their will,
and was prevailed on to relinquish her own judgment. It was then usual for
the Kings of England, after their accession, to pass the first days in
the Tower; and Northumberland immediately conveyed thither the new
sovereign<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Heylin, p. 159.</NOTE>. All the
counsellors were oblig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d to
attend her to that fortress; and by this means be∣came, in some measure,
prisoners in the hands of Northumberland, whose will they were
necessitated to obey. Orders were given by the council, to proclaim Jane
throughout the kingdom; but these orders were executed only in London, and
the neighbourhood. No applause ensued: The people heard the proclama∣tion
with silence and concern: Some even expressed their scorn and contempt:
And one Pot, a vintner's prentice, was severely punished for this
offence<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 160.</NOTE>.

<P>THE people of Suffolk, meanwhile, paid their attendance on Mary.
As they were much attached to the reformed communion, they could not forbear,
amidst their tenders of duty, to express their apprehension for the
protestant religion; but when she assured them, that she never meant
to change the laws of Edward<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Fox, vol. III. p.

affection. The nobility and gentry flocked to her daily, and brought her
reinforcement. The earls of Bath and Suffex, the eldest sons of lord
Wharton and lord Mordaunt, Sir William Drury, Sir Henry Benningfield, Henry
Jerningham, persons whose interests lay in the neighbourhood, appeared at
the head of their tenants and retainers<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Heylin,
p. 160. Burnet, vol. II. p. 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>7.</NOTE>. Sir Ed∣ward Hastings, brother of the earl of
Huntingdon, having received a commis∣sion from the council to make levies
for the lady Jane in Buckinghamshire, car∣ried over his troops, which
amounted to four thousand men, and joined Queen Mary. Even a fleet, which had
been sent by Northumberland to lie off the coast of Suffolk, being forced
into Yarmouth by a storm, were engaged to de∣clare for that princess.</P>
<P>NORTHUMBERLAND, who had hitherto been blinded by ambition, saw
at last the danger gather round him, and knew not to what hand to turn
himself. He had levied forces, which were assembled at London; but
dreading the cabals of the courtiers and counsellors, whose compliance, he
knew, had been entirely the result of fear or artifice, he was resolved to
keep near the person of the lady Jane, and send Suffolk to command the
army. But the counsellors, who wished to remove him<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Godwin, p. 330. Heylin, p. 159. Burnet, vol. II. p. 239. Fox, vol.
III. p. 15.</NOTE>, working on the filial tenderness of Jane, magnified to
her the danger to which her father would be exposed, and represented, that
Northum∣berland, who had gained reputation by suppressing formerly a
rebellion in those parts, was much more proper to command in that enterprize.
The Duke him∣self, who knew the slender capacity of Suffolk, began to
think, that none but himself was able to encounter the present danger; and
he agreed to take on him the command of the troops. The counsellors attended
on him at his departure with the highest protestations of attachment, and
none more than Arundel, his mortal enemy<NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">Heylin, p.

<P>THE duke had no sooner reached St. Edmond's-bury, than he
found his army, which never exceeded six thousand men, too weak to
encounter the Queen's<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Godwin, p. 3<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>1.</NOTE>, which amounted to double the
number. He wrote to the council, desiring them to send him a reinforcement;
and the counsellors immediately laid hold of this pretence to free
themselves from their confinement. They left the Tower, as if<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lady Jane de∣serted by the people.</NOTE>they meant to execute
Northumberland's commands; but being assembled in Baynard's-castle, a
house belonging to Pembroke, they deliberated concerning the method of
shaking off his usurped tyranny. Arundel began the conference, by
representing the injustice and cruelty of Northumberland, the exorbitancy
of his ambition, the criminal enterprize which he had projected, and the guilt
in which he had involved the whole council; and he asserted, that the only
method of making atonement for their past offence, was by a prompt return to
the duty which they owed their lawful sovereign<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 331, 332. Thuanus, lib. xiii.</NOTE>. This motion was
seconded by Pem∣broke, who, clapping his hand to his sword, swore he was
ready to fight any man who expressed himself of a contrary sentiment.
The mayor and aldermen of London were immediately sent for, who discovered
great alacrity in obeying the orders they received to proclaim Mary. The people
expressed their approbation by shouts of applause. Even Suffolk, who
commanded in the Tower, finding resistance vain, opened the gates, and
declared for the Queen. The lady Jane, after wearing the vain pageantry of a
crown during ten days, returned to a private life with much more satisfaction
than she felt when the royalty was tendered to her<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Godwin, p. 332. Thuan. lib. xiii. c. 2.</NOTE>: And the
messengers who were sent to Northumberland, with orders to lay down his
arms, found that he had despaired of success, was deserted by all his

<P>THE Queen gave orders for taking into custody the duke of

two of his younger sons, Sir Andrew Dudley <PB N="352" REF="356"/> his
brother, the marquess of Northampton, the earl of Huntingdon, Sir Tho∣mas
Palmer, and Sir John Gates. The Queen afterwards confined the duke of Suffolk,
the lady Jane Gray, and lord Guilford Dudley. But Mary was desir∣ous, in the
beginning of her reign, to acquire popularity by the appearance of clemency;
and because the counsellors pleaded constraint, as an excuse for their
treason, she extended her pardon to most of them. Suffolk himself
recovered his liberty; and he owed this indulgence, in a great measure, to
the contempt entertained of his capacity. But the guilt of Northumberland was
too great, as well as his ambition and courage too dangerous, to permit him to
entertain any reasonable hopes of life. When brought to his trial, he only
desired permission to ask two questions of the peers who were
appointed to sit on his jury; whether a man could be guilty of treason who
obeyed orders given him by the council under the great seal? and whether
those who were involved in the same guilt with himself, could act as his
judges? Being told, that the great seal of an usurper was no authority, and
that persons who lay not under any sentence of attainder, were still
innocent in the eye of the law, and might be admitted on any jury<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. II. p. 243. Heylin, p. 18. Baker, p. 316.

Sir Thomas Palmer, and Sir John Gates, suffered with him; and this was all
the blood spilt on account of so dangerous and criminal an enterprize
against the rights of the sovereign. Sentence was pronounced against the
lady Jane and lord Guilford; but without any present intention of putting it
in exe∣cution. The youth and innocence of the persons, neither of whom had
reached their seventeenth year, pleaded sufficiently in their favour.</P>
<P>WHEN Mary first arrived in the Tower, the duke of Norfolk, who
had been detained prisoner during all the last reign; Courtney, son to
the marquess of Exeter, who, without being charged with any crime, had been
subjected to the same punishment ever since his father's attainder;
Gardiner, Tonstal, and Bonner, who had been confined for their adherence to
the catholic cause, appeared before her, and implored her clemency and
protection<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Heylin, p. 20. Stowe, p. 61<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Holingshed, p. 1088.</NOTE>. They
were all of them re∣stored to their liberty, and immediately admitted to her
confidence and favour▪ <PB N="353" REF="357"/> Norfolk's attainder,
notwithstanding that it had passed in Parliament, was repre∣sented as
null and invalid; because, among other informalities, no special matter had
been alleged against him, except wearing a coat of arms, which he and his
ancestors, without giving any offence, had always made use of in the face
of the court and of the whole nation. Courtney received the title of earl of
Devon∣shire; and tho' educated in such close confinement, that he was
altogether unac∣quainted with the world, he soon acquired all the
accomplishments of a courtier and a gentleman, and made a considerable
figure during the few years which he lived after he recovered his liberty.
Besides performing all those popular acts, which, tho' they only regarded
individuals, were very acceptable to the nation, the Queen endeavoured to
ingratiate herself with the public, by granting a gene∣ral pardon, tho' with
some exceptions, and by remitting the subsidy voted to her brother in the
last Parliament<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Stowe, p.
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>16.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE joy arising from the succession of the lawful heir,
and from the gracious demeanour of the sovereign, hindered not the people
from being agitated with great anxiety concerning the state of religion; and
as the bulk of the nation in∣clined to the protestant communion,
apprehensions were generally entertained of the principles and prejudices of
the new Queen. The legitimacy of Mary's birth had appeared to be somewhat
connected with the papal authority; and as that princess was educated with
her mother, she had imbibed the strongest attachment to the catholic
communion, and the highest aversion to those new tenets, whence, she
believed, all the misfortunes of her family had originally sprung. The
dis∣couragements which she lay under from her father, tho' at last they
brought her to comply with his will, tended still more to increase her
disgust to the reformers; and the vexations which the protector and the
council gave her, during Edward's reign, had no other effect than to confirm
her farther in her prejudices. Natu∣rally of a four and obstinate temper, and
irritated by contradictions and mis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or∣tunes, she possessed all the qualities fitted to
compose a bigot; and her extreme ignorance rendered her utterly incapable of
doubt in her own belief, or of in∣dulgence to the opinions of others. The
nation, therefore, had great reason to dread, not only the abolition, but the
persecution of the established religion from the zeal of Mary; and it was
not long before she discovered her inten∣tions.</P>

forwardness to revive the mass, tho' contrary to the present laws. Judge

to plead the promise which the Queen, when they inlisted themselves in
her service, had given them, of maintaining the reformed religion: One, in
particular, was set in the pillory, because he had been too peremptory in
recalling to her memory the engagements which she had taken on that
occasion. And tho' the Queen still promised, in a public declara∣tion
before the council, to tolerate those who differed from her<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol II. p. 215.</NOTE>, men foresaw, that this
engagement, like the former, would prove but a feeble security, when set in
opposition to religious prejudices.</P>
<P>THE merits of Cranmer towards the Queen, during the reign of
Henry, had been considerable; and he had successfully employed his good
offices in mitigat∣ing the severe prejudices which that monarch had
entertained against her<NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 240, 241. Heylin,
p. 25. Godwin, p. 33<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE>. But
the active part which he bore in promoting her mother's divorce, as well as in
conducting the reformation, had made him the object of her hatred; and tho'
Gardiner had been equally forward in solliciting and defending the divorce,
he had afterwards made sufficient atonement by his sufferings in de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ence of the catho∣lic cause. The
primate, therefore, had reason to expect little favour during the present
reign; but it was by his own indiscreet zeal, that he brought on himself
the first violence and persecution. A report being spread, that Cranmer,
in or∣der to make his court to the Queen, had promised to officiate in the
Latin ser∣vice, the archbishop, to wipe off this aspersion, drew up a
manifesto in his own defence. Among other expressions, he there said,
that as the devil was a ly<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r 
<PB N="355" REF="359"/> from the beginning, and the father of lies, so he had
at this time stirred up his servants to persecute Christ and his true
religion: That that infernal spirit now endeavoured to restore the Latin
satisfactory masses, a thing of his own inven∣tion and device; and in
order to effectuate his purpose, had falsely made use of Cranmer's name
and authority: And that the mass is not only without founda∣tion, either in
the scriptures or the practice of the primitive church, but likewise
discovers a plain contradiction to antiquity and the inspired writings, and
is be∣sides replete with many horrid blasphemies<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Fox, vol. III. p. 94. Heylin, p. 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. Godwin, p. 3<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>6.

inflam∣matory paper, Cranmer was thrown into prison, and was tried for the
part which he had acted, in concurring with the lady Jane, and opposing the
Queen's acces∣sion. Sentence of high treason was pronounced against
him; and tho' his guilt was shared with the whole privy council, and was even
less than that of most of the others, this sentence, however severe,
must be allowed entirely legal. The execution of it, however, did not follow;
and Cranmer was reserved for a more cruel punishment.</P>
<P>PETER Martyr, seeing a persecution gathering against the
reformers, desired leave to withdraw<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Heylin,

catholics moved for his commit∣ment, Gardiner both pleaded, that he had come
over by an invitation from the government, and generously furnished him
with supplies for his journey: But as bigotted zeal still increased, his
wife's body, which had been interred at Ox∣ford, was afterwards dug up by
public order, and buried in a dung-hill<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Heylin,

the nation thereby lost many useful hands for arts and manufactures.

every thing bore a dismal aspect for the reformation.</P>
<P>DURING this revolution of the court, no protection was expected

which was summoned to assemble. A zealous re∣former<NOTE N="{inverted †}" PLACE="foot">Beale. But Fox, who lived at the time, and is very minute in his

were used in the elections; but besides that the authority of this writer
is inconsiderable, that practice, as the necessities of government
seldom required it, had not hitherto been often employed in England. There
still remained such numbers devoted, by opinion or affection, 
<PB N="356" REF="360"/> to many principles of the ancient religion, that the
authority of the crown was able to give such candidates the prevalence in
most elections; and all those who scrupled compliance with the court
religion, rather declined taking a seat in the house, which, while it
rendered them obnoxious to the Queen, could afterwards afford them no
protection against the violence of prerogative. It soon appeared,
therefore, that a majority of the commons would be obsequious to Mary's
de∣signs; and as the peers were mostly attached to the court, from
interest or ex∣pectation, little opposition was expected from that
quarter.</P>
<P>IN opening the Parliament, the court showed a very signal
contempt of the laws, by celebrating, before the two houses, a mass of the
Holy Ghost, in the Latin tongue, attended with all the ancient rites and
ceremonies, tho' abolished by act of parliament<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Fox,
vol. III. p. 19.</NOTE>. Taylor, bishop of Lincoln, having refused to kneel
at this service, was very severely handled, and was violently thrust out
of the house<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. II. p. 252.</NOTE>.
The Queen, however, still retained the title of supreme head of the church
of England; and it was generally pretended, that the intention of the court was
only to restore religion to the same condition in which it had been left by
Henry; but that the other abuses of popery, which were chiefly grievous to
the nation, would never be revived.</P>
<P>THE first bill passed by the Parliament, was of a very
popular nature, and abolished every species of treason which was not
contained in the statute of Ed∣ward the third, and every species of felony
which did not subsist before the first of Henry the eighth<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Mariae, sess. 1. c. 1. By this repeal, tho' it
was in general popular, the clause of 5 and 6 Edw. VI. c. 11. was lost,
which re∣quired the confronting two witnesses, in order to prove any
treason.</NOTE>. The Parliament next declared the Queen to be legiti∣mate,
ratified the marriage of Henry with Catherine of Arragon, and annulled the
divorce pronounced by Cranmer<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Mariae,
sess. 2. c. 1.</NOTE>, whom they greatly blamed on that account. No
mention, however, is made of the pope's authority, as any ground of the
marriage. The statutes of King Edward with regard to religion, were repealed
by one vote<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">1 Mariae, sess. 2. c.
12.</NOTE>; and thereby the national religion was replaced on the same
foot∣ing on which it stood at the death of Henry. The attainder of the duke
of Nor∣folk was reversed; and this act of justice was much more
reasonable than the declaring that attainder invalid, without farther
authority. Most of the clauses of the riot act, passed in the late
reign, were revived: A step which eluded, in a great measure, the popular
statute enacted at the first meeting of the Parliament.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING the compliance of the two houses with the
Queen's will, they had still a reserve in certain articles; and her choice
of a husband was, in <PB N="357" REF="361"/> particular, of such importance
to national interest, that they were determined not to submit tamely, in
that respect, to her will and inclination. There were three marriages<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Thuan. lib. ii. c. 3.</NOTE>, concerning which it was
supposed that Mary deliberated after her accession to the crown. The
first person proposed to her, was Courtney, earl of Devonshire, who,
being an Englishman, nearly allied to the crown, could not fail to be
acceptable to the nation; and as he was of an engaging person and address,
he had gained visibly on the Queen's affections, and hints were dropt him of
her favourable dispositions towards him<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Godwin, p. 339.</NOTE>. But that nobleman ne∣glected these
overtures; and seemed rather to attach himself to the lady Eliza∣beth,
whose youth, and agreeable conversation, he preferred to all the power and
grandeur of her sister. This choice occasioned a great coldness of Mary
towards Devonshire; and made her break out in a declared animosity
against Elizabeth. The ancient quarrel between their mothers had sunk deep
into the malignant heart of the Queen; and after the declaration made by
Parliament in favour of Catherine's marriage, she wanted not a pretence for
representing the birth of her sister as illegitimate. The attachment of
Elizabeth to the reformed religion of∣fended Mary's bigotry; and as the young
princess had made some difficulty of disguising her sentiments, very
violent menaces had been employed to bring her to compliance. But when the
Queen found that Elizabeth had obstructed her views in a point, which,
perhaps, touched her still more nearly, her resentment, excited by pride,
knew no longer any bounds; and the princess was visibly ex∣posed to the
greatest danger<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Heylin, p. 31. Bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>net, vol II. p. 255.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>CARDINAL Pole, who had never taken any but deacon's orders, was
another party proposed to the Queen; and there appeared many reasons to
induce her to make choice of this prelate. The high character of Pole for
virtue and gene∣rosity; the great regard paid him by the catholic church, of
which he had near∣ly reached the highest dignity on the death of Paul the
third<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Father Paul, book iii.</NOTE>; the Queen's
af∣fection for the countess of Salisbury, his mother, who had once been her
gover∣ness; the violent animosity to which he had been exposed on account
of his attachment to the Romish communion; all these considerations had a
pow∣erful influence on Mary. But the cardinal was now in the decline of life;
and having contracted habits of study and retirement, he was represented as
un∣qualified for the bustle of a court, and the hurry of business<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Heylin, p. 31.</NOTE>. The Queen, therefore, dropt all
views of that alliance: But as she entertained a great regard for Pole's
wisdom and virtue, she still proposed to reap the benefit of his advice
<PB N="358" REF="362"/> in the administration of her government. She
secretly entered into a negociation with Commendone, an agent of cardinal
Dandino, legate at Brussels; she sent assurances to the pope, then
Julius the third, of her earnest desire to reconcile herself and her
kingdoms to the holy see; and she desired that Pole might be appointed
legate for the performance of that pious office<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Burnet,
vol. II. p. 258.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THESE two marriages being rejected, the Queen cast her eye
towards the em∣peror's family, from which her mother was descended, and
which, during her greatest distresses, had always afforded her
countenance and protection. Charles the fifth, who a few years before was
almost absolute master of Germany, had exercised his power in such an
arbitrary manner, that he gave extreme disgust to the nation, who
apprehended the total extinction of their liberties and privileges from the
encroachments of that monarch<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Thuanus, lib. iv.
c. 17.</NOTE>. Religion had served him as a pre∣tence for his usurpations;
and from the same principle he met with that opposi∣tion which overthrew
his grandeur, and dashed all his ambitious hopes. Mau∣rice, elector of
Saxony, enraged that the landgrave of Hesse, who, by his ad∣vice, and on
his assurances, had put himself into the emperor's hands, should be
unjustly detained prisoner, formed a secret conspiracy among the
protestant princes; and covering his intentions with the most artificial
disguises, he suddenly march∣ed his forces against Charles, and
narrowly missed becoming master of his per∣son. The protestants flew
to arms in every quarter; and their insurrection, aid∣ed by an invasion
from France, reduced the emperor to such extremity, that he was obliged to
submit to articles of peace, which ensured the independency of Germany. To
retrieve his honour, he made an attack on France; and laying siege to Metz,
with an army of an hundred thousand men, he conducted the enterprize in
person, and seemed determined, at all hazards, to succeed in an
undertaking which had attracted the attention of all Europe. But the duke of
Guise, who defended M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tz, with a
garrison composed of the bravest nobility of France, exerted such
vigilance, conduct, and valour, that the siege was pro∣tracted to the depth
of winter; and the emperor found it dangerous to perse∣vere any longer. He
retired with the remains of his army, into the Low Coun∣tries, much dejected
with that reverse of fortune which, in his declining years, had so fatally
overtaken him.</P>
<P>NO so<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ner did
Charles hear of the death of Edward, and the accession of his kinswoman,
Mary, to the crown of England, than he formed the scheme of ac∣quiring that
kingdom to his family; and he hoped, by this incident, to com∣pensate all the
losses which he had suffered in Germany. His son, Philip, who 
<PB N="359" REF="363"/> was a widower, had but one son by his former marriage;
and tho' he was only twenty-seven years of age, eleven years younger than the
Queen, this objection, it was thought, might easily be overlooked, and there
was no reason to despair of her having still a numerous issue. The
emperor, therefore, immediately sent over an agent to signify his
intentions to Mary, who, pleased with the support of so power∣ful an
alliance, and glad to unite herself more closely with her mother's fami∣ly,
to which she was ever strongly attached, readily embraced the proposal.
Norfolk, Arundel, and Paget, gave their advice for the match: And Gardiner, who
was become prime minister, and who had been promoted to the office of
chancellor, finding how Mary's inclinations lay, seconded the project of the
Spa∣nish alliance; and represented, both to her and the emperor, the
necessity of stopping all farther innovations in religion, till the
completion of the marriage. He observed, that the Parliament, amidst all
their compliances, had discovered evident symptoms of jealousy, and
seemed at present determined, to grant no further concessions in favour
of the catholic religion: That tho' they might make a sacrifice to their
sovereign of some speculative principles, which they did not well
comprehend, or of some rites, which seemed not of any immediate
im∣portance, they had imbibed such strong prejudices against the
pretended usurpa∣tions and exactions of the court of Rome, that they would
with great difficulty be again brought to submit to its authority: That the
danger of making a re∣sumption of the abbey lands, would alarm the nobility
and gentry, and induce them to encourage the prepossessions which were
but too general among the peo∣ple, against the doctrine and worship of the
catholic church: That much pains had been taken to prejudice the nation
against the Spanish alliance; and if that point was urged, at the same
time with further changes in religion, it would ha∣zard a general revolt and
insurrection: That the marriage, being once compleat∣ed, would give authority
to the Queen's measures, and enable her afterwards to forward that pious
work, in which she was engaged: And that it was even ne∣cessary
previously to reconcile the people to the marriage, by rendering the
con∣ditions extremely favourable to the English, and such as would seem
to ensure to them their independency, and the entire possession of
their ancient laws and pri∣vileges<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. II. p.
2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE emperor, well acquainted with the prudence and experience of
Gardiner, assented to all these reasons; and he endeavoured to temper
the zeal of Mary, by representing the necessity of proceeding gradually
in the great work of con∣verting the nation. Hearing that cardinal Pole, more
sincere in his religious opinions, and less guided by the maxims of civil
policy, after having sent oppo∣site <PB N="360" REF="364"/> advice to the
Queen, had set out on his journey to England, where he was to exercise his
legantine commission; he thought proper to stop him at Dilling∣hen, a
town on the Danube; and he afterwards obtained Mary's consent for this
detention. The negociation for the marriage mean-while proceeded apace; and
Mary's intentions to espouse Philip became generally known to the nation.
The commons, who hoped that they had gained the Queen by the concessions
which they had already made, were alarmed to hear, that she was resolved to
contract a<NOTE PLACE="marg">6th of De∣cember.</NOTE>foreign alliance; and they
sent a committee to remonstrate against that dangerous measure. To
prevent farther applications of the same kind, she thought proper to
dissolve them.</P>
<P>A CONVOCATION had been summoned at the same time with the
Parliament; and the majority here also appeared to be of the court religion.
An offer was very frankly made by the Romanists, to dispute concerning the
points controvert∣ed between the two communions; and as transubstantiation
was the article which, of all others, they esteemed the clearest, and
founded on the most irresistible ar∣gument, they chose to try their
strength by defending it. The protestants push∣ed the dispute as far as
the clamour and noise of their antagonists would permit; and they fondly
imagined, that they had obtained some advantage, when, in the course of the
debate, they obliged the catholics to avow, that, according to their doctrine,
Christ had, in his last supper, held himself in his hand, and had
swal∣lowed and eat himself<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Collier, vol. II. p.
356. Fox, vol. III. p. 22.</NOTE>. This triumph, however, was confined only to
their own party: The Romanists maintained, that their champions had clearly
the better of the day; that their adversaries were blind and obstinate
heretics; that no∣thing but the most extreme depravity of heart could induce
men to dispute such self-evident principles; and that the severest
punishments were due to their per∣verse wickedness. So pleased were
they with their superiority in this favorite point, that they soon after
renewed the dispute at Oxford; and to show, that they feared no force of
learning or capacity, where reason was so evidently on their side, they
sent thither Cranmer, Latimer, and Ridley, under a guard, to try whether
these renowned controversialists could find any appearance of argu∣ment
to defend their baffled principles<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Mem. of
Cranm. p. 334. Heylin, p. 50.</NOTE>. The issue of the debate was very
dif∣ferent from what it appeared to be a few years before, in a famous
conference held at the same place during the reign of Edward.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1554" UNIT="year"/> AFTER the Parliament and
convocation were broke up, the new laws with re∣gard to religion, tho' they had
been anticipated, in most places, by the zeal of <PB N="361" REF="365"/> the
catholics, countenanced by the government, were still more openly put in
execution: The mass was every where re-established; and marriage was
declared to be incompatible with any spiritual office. It has been
asserted by some writers, that three fourths of the clergy▪ were, at
this time, deprived of their livings; tho' other historians, more
accurate<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Harm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r, p. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>8.</NOTE>, have
esteemed the number of sufferers far short of this proportion. Could any
principles of law, justice or reason be at∣tended to, where
superstition predominates; the priests would never have been expelled for
their past marriages, which at that time were permitted by the laws of the
kingdom. A visitation was appointed, in order to restore more perfectly the
mass and the antient rites. Among other articles the commissioners were
enjoined to forbid the oath of supremacy to be taken by the clergy on their
receiving any benefice<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Collier, vol. II. p
36<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. Fox, vol. III. p.
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>8. Heylin, p.
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> lib 25.</NOTE>. It is to be
observed, that this oath had been established by the laws of Henry the
eighth, which were still in force.</P>
<P>THIS violent and sudden change of religion inspired the
protestants with great discontent; and even affected indifferent
spectators with concern, by the hard∣ships, to which so many individuals
were on that account exposed. But the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Queen's mar∣riage
with Philip.</NOTE>Spanish match was a point of more general concern, and
diffused universal ap∣prehensions for the liberty and independance of the
nation. To obviate all cla∣mour, the articles of marriage were drawn as
favourable as possible for the interest and security, and even grandeur
of England. It was agreed, that tho' Philip should have the title of King,
the administration should be entirely in the Queen; that no foreigner
should be capable of enjoying any office in the kingdom; that no innovation
should be made in the English laws, customs and privileges; that Philip
should not carry the Queen abroad without her consent, nor any of her
children without the consent of the nobility; that sixty thousand pounds
a year should be settled on her as her jointure; that the male issue of
this marriage should inherit, together with England, both Burgundy and the
Low Countries; and that, if Don Carlos, Philip's son by his former marriage,
should die and his line be extinct, the Queen's issue, whether male or
female, should inherit Spain, Sicily, Milan, and all the other dominions of
Philip<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rymer, XV. p. 377.</NOTE>. Such was the treaty
of<NOTE PLACE="marg">1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th
January.</NOTE>marriage signed by count Egmont, and four other
ambassadors sent over to England by the emperor.</P>
<P>THESE articles, when published, gave no satisfaction to the
nation: It was universally said, that the emperor, in order to g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t possession of England, would
verbally agree to any terms; and the greater advantage there appeared in the 
<PB N="362" REF="366"/> conditions which he granted, the more certainly might it
be concluded, that he had no serious intention of observing them: That the
usual fraud and ambition of that monarch might assure the nation of
such a conduct; and his son Philip, while he inherited these vices from
his father, added to them tyranny, sullenness, pride, and barbarity, more
dangerous vices of his own: That England would become a province, and a
province to a kingdom which usually exercised the most violent authority
over all her dependant dominions: That the Netherlands, Milan, Sicily, Naples
groaned under the burthen of Spanish tyranny; and throughout all the new
conquests in America there had been displayed scenes of unrelenting
cruelty, hitherto unknown in the history of mankind: That the inqui∣sition
was a tribunal invented by that tyrannical nation; and would infallibly, with
all their other laws and institutions, be introduced into England: And that
the divided sentiments of the people with regard to religion would subject
mul∣titudes to this iniquitous tribunal, and would reduce the whole nation to
the most abject servitude<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Heylin, p. 32. Burnet,
vol. II. p. 268. Godwin, p. 339.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THESE complaints, being diffused thro' the whole people,
prepared the nation for a rebellion; and had any foreign power given them
encouragement, or any great man appeared to head them; the consequences might
have proved fatal to the Queen's authority. But the King of France, tho'
engaged in hostilities with the emperor, refused to concur in any
proposal for an insurrection; lest he should afford Mary a pretence for
declaring war against him. And the more prudent part of the nobility thought,
that, as the evils of the Spanish alliance were only dreaded at a distance,
matters were not yet fully prepared for a general revolt. Some persons,
however, more turbulent than the rest, believed, that it would be safer to
prevent than to redress grievances; and they framed a conspiracy to
rise<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wiat's insur∣rection.</NOTE>in arms, and declare
against the Queen's marriage with Philip. Sir Thomas Wiat proposed to
raise Kent, Sir Peter Carew, Devonshire; and they engaged the duke of
Suffolk, by the hopes of recovering the crown for the lady Jane, to attempt
raising the midland counties<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Heylin, p. 33.
Godwin, p. 340.</NOTE>. Carew's impatience or apprehensions engaged him to
break the concert, and to rise in arms before the day appointed: He was
soon suppressed by the earl of Bedford, and obliged to fly into France.
On this intelligence, Suffolk, dreading an arrest, suddenly left the town,
with his brothers, the lord Thomas, and lord Leonard Gray; and endeavoured to
raise the people in the counties of Warwic and Leicester; where his
interest lay: But he was so closely followed by the earl of Huntingdon,
at the head of 300 horse, that he was obliged to disperse his retainers,
and being discovered in his retreat, he was <PB N="363" REF="367"/> led
prisoner to London<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Fox, vol. III. p.
30.</NOTE>. Wiat was at first more successful in his attempt; and having
published a declaration at Maidstone in Kent, against the Queen's evil
counsellors and against the Spanish match, without any mention of
religion, the people began to gather under his standard. The duke of Norfolk
with Sir Henry Jernegan was sent against him, at the head of the guards and
some other troops, reinforced with 500 Londoners commanded by Bret: And he
came within sight of the rebels at Rochester, where they had fixed their
head quarters. Sir George Harper here pretended to desert from them; but
having secretly gained Bret, these two persons so wrought on the
Londoners, that that whole body deserted to Wiat, and declared that they
would not contribute to enslave their native country. Norfolk, dreading the
contagion of this example, imme∣diately retreated with his troops and took
shelter in London<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Heylin, p. 33. Godwin, p. 341.

<P>AFTER this proof of the dispositions of the people,
especially of the Lon∣doners, who were mostly protestants, Wiat was
encouraged to proceed; and he led his forces to Southwark, where he required of
the Queen, that she should put the Tower into his hands, should deliver
four counsellors as hostages, and in order to ensure the liberty of the
nation, immediately marry an Englishman. Finding that the bridge was
secured against him, and that the city was over∣awed, he marched up to
Kingston, where he passed the river with 4000 men; and returning towards
London, hoped to encourage his partizans, who had en∣gaged to declare for him.
He had imprudently wasted so much time at South∣wark, and in his march from
Kingston, that the critical season, on which all popular commotions
depend, was entirely lost; and tho' he entered Westminster without
resistance, his followers, finding that no person of note joined him,
in∣sensibly sell off, and he was at last seized near Temple-Bar by
Sir Maurice Berk∣ley<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Fox, vol. III. p. 31.

Wiat was condemned and exe∣cuted; and as it had been reported, that, at his
examination, he had accused the lady Elizabeth and the earl of Devonshire,
he took care on the scaffold, before the whole people, fully to acquit them
of having any share in the rebellion.</P>
<P>THE lady Elizabeth had been, during some time, treated with
great harshness by her sister; and many studies instances of
discouragement and disrespect had been practised against her. She was
ordered to take place at court after the countess of L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nox and the dutchess of Suffolk, as if she were not
legitimate, of the <PB N="364" REF="368"/> royal blood: Her friends were
discountenanced on every occasion: And while her virtues, which were now
become very eminent, drew to her the attendance of all the young nobility, and
rendered her the favourite of the nation, the malevolence of the Queen still
discovered itself every day by fresh symptoms, and obliged the
princess to retire into the country. Mary seized the opportunity of this
rebellion; and hoping to involve her sister in some appearance of guilt,
sent for her under a strong guard, committed her to the Tower, and ordered
her to be very strictly examined by the council. But the public declaration
made by Wiat rendered it impracticable to employ against her any false
evidence, which might have offered; and the princess made so good a
defence, that the Queen found herself under a necessity of
dismissing her<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Godwin, p. 343. Burnet, vol. II.
p. 273. Fox, vol. III. p. 99, 105. Strype's Mem. vol. III. p. 85.</NOTE>. In
order to send her out of the kingdom, a marriage was proposed to her with
the duke of Savoy; and when she declined giving her consent, she was
committed to custody, under a very strong guard, at Wodestoke. The earl
of Devonshire, tho' equally inno∣cent, was confined in Fortheringay
castle.</P>
<P>BUT this rebellion proved still more fatal to the lady Jane
Gray, as well as to her husband: The duke of Suffolk's guilt was imputed to
her; and tho' the insurgents and malecontents seemed chiefly to rest
their hopes on the lady Eliza∣beth and the earl of Devonshire, the Queen,
incapable of generosity or clemency, was determined to remove every person,
from whom the least danger could be apprehended. Warning was given the lady
Jane to prepare for death; a doom which she had long expected, and which the
innocence of her life, as well as the misfortunes to which she had been
exposed, rendered no unwelcome news to her. The Queen's bigotted zeal, under
colour of tender mercy to the prisoner's soul, induced her to send
divines, who molested her with perpetual disputation; and even a reprieve
of three days was granted her, in hopes that she would be per∣suaded,
during that time, to pay, by a timely conversion, some regard to her
eternal welfare. The lady Jane had presence of mind, in those melancholy
cir∣cumstances, not only to desend her religion by all the topics then in
use, but also to write a letter to her sister<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Fox, vol. III. p. 35. Heylin, p. 166.</NOTE>in the Greek language;
in which, besides sending her a copy of the scriptures in that tongue,
she exhorted her to maintain, in every<NOTE PLACE="marg">12th
February</NOTE>fortune, a like steddy perseverance. On the day of her
execution, her husband, the lord Guilford, desired permission to see
her; but she refused her consent, and sent him word, that the
tenderness of their parting would overcome the fortitude of both, and would
too much unbend their minds from that constancy, which their approaching end
required of them: Their separation, she said, would be 
<PB N="365" REF="369"/> only for a moment; and they would soon rejoin each
other in a scene, where their affections would be for ever united, and where
death, disappointment, and misfortunes could no longer have access to them,
or disturb their eternal felicity<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Heylin, p.
167. Baker, p. 319.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IT had been intended to execute the lady Jane and lord Guilford
together on the same scaffold at Tower-hill; but the council, dreading the
compassion of the people for their youth, beauty, innocence, and noble
birth, changed their orders, and gave directions that she should be
beheaded within the verge of the Tower.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Execution of lady
Jane Gray.</NOTE>She saw her husband led to execution; and having given him
from the window some token of her remembrance, she waited with tranquillity
till her own ap∣pointed hour should bring her to a like fate. She even
sav<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> his headless body carried
back in a cart; and found herself more confirmed by the reports, which she
heard of the constancy of his end, than shaken by so tender and
melancholy a spectacle. Sir John Gage, constable of the Tower, when he led
her to exe∣cution, desired her to bestow on him some small present,
which he might keep as a perpetual memorial of her: She gave him her
table-book, where she had just wrote three sentences on seeing her
husband's dead body; one in Greek, another in Latin, a third in
English<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Heylin, p. 167.</NOTE>. The purport of them
was, that human justice was against his body, but the divine mercy would be
favourable to his soul; and that if her fault deserved punishment, her
youth at least, and her imprudence were worthy of excuse; and that God and
posterity, she trusted, would show her favour. On the scaffold, she
made a speech to the bye-standers, where the mildness of her
disposition led her to take the blame entirely on herself, without
uttering one complaint against the severity, with which she had been
treated. She said, that her offence was not the having laid her hand upon the
crown, but the not rejecting it with sufficient constancy: That she had
less erred thro' am∣bition than thro' reverence to her parents, whom she
had been taught to respect and obey: That she willingly received death, as
the only satisfaction which she could now make to the injured state; and
tho' her infringement of the laws had been constrained, she would show,
by her voluntary submission to their sentence, that she was
desirous to attone for that disobedience, into which too much silial
piety had betrayed her: That she had justly deserved this punishment
for being made the instrument, tho' the unwilling instrument, of the
ambition of others: And that the story of her life, she hoped, might at
least be useful, by proving that inno∣cence excuses not great misdeeds,
if they tend any way to the destruction of the commonwealth. After uttering
these words, she caused herself to be disrobed by her women; and with
a steddy serene countenance submitted herself to the exe∣cutioner<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Heylin, p. 167. Fox. vol. III. p. 36, 37.
Holingshed, p. 1099.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="366" REF="370"/> THE duke of Suffolk was tried, condemned,
and executed soon after; and would have met with more compassion, had not
his temerity been the cause of his daughter's untimely death. The lord Thomas
Gray lost his life for the same crime. Sir Nicholas Throcmorton was tried
in Guildhall; but there appearing no satisfactory evidence against him, he
was able, by making an admirable de∣fence, to obtain a verdict of the jury in
his favour. The Queen was so enraged at this disappointment, that,
instead of releasing him as the law required, she re∣committed him to the
Tower, and kept him in close confinement during some years. But her
resentment stopped not here: The jury, being summoned before the council,
were all of them sent to prison, and afterwards fined, some of them a
thousand pounds, others two thousand a-piece<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Fox,
vol. III. p. 99. Stowe, p. 624. Baker, p. 320. Hollingshed, p. 1104, 1121.
Strype, vol. III. p. 120.</NOTE>. This illegal violence proved fatal to
several, among others to Sir John Throcmorton, brother to Sir Nicholas, who
was condemned on no better evidence than had been formerly rejected. The Queen
filled the Tower and all the prisons with nobility and gentry, whom their
interest with the people, rather than any appearance of guilt, had made the
ob∣jects of her suspicion. And finding, that she was become extremely
odious to the nation, she was resolved to disable them from
resistance, by ordering general musters, and directing the
commissioners to seize their arms, and lay them up in forts and
castles.</P>
<P>THO' the government laboured under so general an odium, the
Queen's autho∣rity had received such an increase from the suppression
of Wiat's rebellion, that the ministry hoped to find a very compliant
disposition in the new Parliament, which was summoned to assemble.
The emperor also, in order to facilitate the<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Parliament.
5th April.</NOTE>same end, had borrowed no less a sum than 400,000 pounds
which he had sent over to England, to be distributed in bribes and
pensions among the members: A pernicious practice, of which there had not
hitherto been any instance in England. And not to give the public any alarm
with regard to the church lands, the Queen, notwithstanding her bigotry,
resumed her legal title of su∣preme head of the church, which she had
dropped three months before. Gar∣diner, the chancellor, opened the
session by a speech; in which he asserted the Queen's hereditary
title to the crown; maintained her right to choose a husband for herself;
he observed how proper an use she had made of that right, by pre∣ferring
an old ally, descended from the house of Burgundy; and remarked the failure
of Henry the eighth's posterity, of whom there now remained none but the
Queen and the lady Elizabeth. He added, that, in order to obviate the
in∣conveniences, <PB N="367" REF="371"/> conveniences, which might arise from
different pretenders, it was necessary to invest the Queen, by law, with
a power of disposing of the crown, and of ap∣pointing her successor:
A power, he said, which was not to be regarded as a new thing in England,
since it had formerly been conferred on Henry the eighth<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Carte, vol. III. p. 310, from Ambass. de
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE Parliament were much disposed to gratify the Queen in
all her desires; but when the liberty, independency, and very being of the
nation were brought into such visible danger, they could not by any means
be brought to compli∣ance. They knew both the inveterate hatred which she
bore the lady Elizabeth, and her devoted attachment to the house of
Austria: They were acquainted with her extreme bigotry, which would lead her
to postpone all considerations of justice or national interest to the
establishment of the catholic religion: They remarked, that Gardiner had
carefully avoided, in his speech, the giving to Elizabeth the appellation of
the Queen's sister; and they thence concluded, that a design was formed
of excluding her as illegitimate: They expected, that Mary, if invested with
such a power as she required, would make a will in her husband's favour,
and thereby render England for ever a province of the Spanish monarchy: And
they were the more alarmed with these projects, when they heard, that
Philip's descent from the house of Lancaster was carefully insisted
on, and that he was publickly represented as the true and only heir by right
of inheritance.</P>
<P>THE Parliament, therefore, aware of their danger, were
determined to keep at a distance from the precipice, which lay before them.
They could not avoid ratifying the articles of marriage<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Mar. P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>l. 2. cap.
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE>, which were drawn very
favourable for Eng∣land; but they declined passing any such law as the
chancellor pointed out to them: They would not so much as declare it
treason to imagine or attempt the death of the Queen's husband, while she
was alive; and a bill introduced for that purpose was laid aside after the
first reading. The more effectually to cut off Philip's hopes of exerting any
authority in England, they passed a law, where they declared, 
<Q REND="inline">"that her majesty as their only Queen,
should solely and as a sole Queen, enjoy the crown and sovereignty of
her realms, with all the pre∣eminences, dignities, and rights thereto
belonging, in as large and ample a manner after her marriage as before, without
any title or claim accruing to the prince of Spain, either as tenant by
courtesy of the realm, or by any other means<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ib. cap. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>A LAW passed in this Parliament for re-er<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cting the bishopric of Durham, which
had been dissolved by the last Parliament of Edward<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Ib. cap. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE>. The Queen had <PB N="368" REF="372"/> already, by an
exertion of her absolute power, put Tonstal in possession of that
see: But tho' it was usual at that time for the crown to assume
authority which might seem entirely legislative, it was always esteemed
more safe and satisfactory to procure the sanction of Parliament. Bills
were introduced for suppressing erro∣neous opinions contained in books,
and for reviving the law of the six articles, together with those against
the Lollards, against heresy and erroneous preaching: But none of these
laws could pass the two houses. A proof, that the Parliament had reserves
even in their concessions with regard to religion; about which they seem
to have been less scrupulous. The Queen, therefore, finding that they<NOTE PLACE="marg">5th May.</NOTE>would not serve all her purposes, finished
the session by dissolving them.</P>
<P>MARY'S thoughts were now entirely employed about receiving Don
Philip, whose arrival she hourly expected. This princess, who had lived
so many years in a very reserved and private manner, without any prospect
or hopes of a hus∣band, was so smit with affection for her young
spouse, whom she had never seen, that she waited with the utmost
impatience for the completion of the marriage; and every obstacle was to her
a source of anxiety and discontent<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Strype, vol.
III. p. 125.</NOTE>. She com∣plained of Philip's delays as affected; and she
could not conceal her vexation, that, tho' she brought him a kingdom for a
dowry, he treated her with such ne∣glect, that he had never yet favoured her
with a single letter. Her fondness was but the more encreased by this
supercilious treatment; and when she found that her subjects had
entertained the greatest aversion for the event, to which she directed
her fondest wishes, she made the whole English nation the object of her
resentment. A squadron, under the command of lord Effingham, had been
fitted out to convoy Philip from Spain, where he then resided; but the
admiral informing her, that the discontents ran very high among the seamen,
and that it was not safe for Philip to entrust himself into their hands,
she gave orders to dismiss them. She then dreaded, that the French fleet,
being masters of the sea, might intercept her husband; and every rumour
of danger, every blast of wind, threw her into panics and convulsions. Her
health, and even her understanding, were visibly impaired by this extreme
impatience; and she was struck with a new apprehension, left her
person, impaired by time, and blasted by sickness, should render her
less acceptable to her future spouse. Her glass discovered to her how
hagard she was become, and when she remarked the decay of her person,
she knew not whether she ought more to desire or apprehend the arrival of
Philip.</P>

where<NOTE PLACE="marg">19th July.</NOTE>Philip displayed his wealth with

afterwards resided. The prince's behaviour was ill calculated to cure the
prejudices, which the English nation had entertained against him. He was
distant and reserved in his address; took no notice of the salutes even
of the most considerable noblemen; and so entrenched himself in forms
and ceremonies, that he was in a manner inaccessible<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> p

circum∣stance rendered him the more acceptable to the Queen, who desired to
have no company but her husband's, and who was impatient when she met with
any in∣terruption to her fondness. The shortest absence gave her
vexation; and when he showed civilities to any other woman, she could not
conceal her jealousy and resentment.</P>
<P>THE Queen soon found, that Philip's ruling passion was
ambition; and that the only method of gratifying him and securing his
affections was to render him master of England. The interest and liberty of
her people were considera∣tions of small moment, in comparison of her
obtaining this favourite point. She summoned a new Parliament, in hopes of
finding them entirely compliant; and that she might acquire the greater
authority over them, she imitated the precedent of the former reign, and
wrote circular letters directing a proper choice of members<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Mem. of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>.</NOTE>.
The zeal of the catholics, the influence of Spanish gold, the<NOTE PLACE="marg">12th Novem∣ber.</NOTE>powers of prerogative, the discouragement
of the gentry, particularly of the protestants; all these causes,
seconding the intrigues of Gardiner, had procured her a house of commons
which was, in a great measure, to her satisfaction; and it was thought,
from the disposition of the nation, that she might now safely omit, in
her summons of the Parliament, the title of <HI>supreme bead of the

arrived in Flanders, invested with legantine power from the pope: In order to
prepare the way for his arrival in England, the Parliament passed an act,
reversing his attainder, and restoring his blood; and the Queen
dispensing with the old statute of provisors, granted him
permission to act a▪ legate. The <PB N="370" REF="374"/> cardinal came
over to London; and after being introduced to the King and Queen, he invited
the Parliament to reconcile themselves and the kingdom to the apostolic
see, from which they had been so long and so unhappily se∣parated. This
message was taken in good part; and both houses voted an ad∣dress to
Philip and Mary, acknowleging that they had been guilty of a most horrible
defection from the true church; professing a sincere repentance for their
past transgressions; declaring their resolution to repeal all laws
enacted in preju∣dice of the church of Rome; and praying their majesties,
that since they were happily uninfected with that criminal schism, they
would intercede with the holy father for their absolution and
forgiveness<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Fox, vol. III. p. iii. Heylin, p.
42. Burnet, vol. II. p. 293. Godwin, p. 247.</NOTE>. Their request was
easily granted. The legate, in name of his holiness, gave the Parliament
and kingdom absolu∣tion, freed them from all censures, and received them
again into the bosom of the church. The pope, then Julius the third, being
informed of these transac∣tions, said, that it was an unexampled

allowing them to do what he ought to give them thanks for performing<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Fa∣the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

<P>NOTWITHSTANDING the extreme zeal of those times, for and
against popery, the object always uppermost with the nobility and gentry,
was the care of their money and estates; and they were not brought to make
these concessions in fa∣vour of Rome, till they had received repeated
assurances, from the pope as well as the Queen, that the plunder which they
had made of the ecclesiastics, should never be enquired into; and that
the abbey and church lands should remain with the present
possessors<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Heylin, p. 41.</NOTE>. But not
trusting altogether to these promises, the Parlia∣ment took care, in the
law itself<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">1 &amp; 2 Phil. &amp; Mar. c.

pope's authority, to insert a clause, in which, besides bestowing
va∣lidity on all marriages celebrated during the schism, and fixing the
right of in∣cumbents to their benefices, they gave security to the
possessors of church lands, and freed them from all danger of
ecclesiastical censures. The convocation also, in order to remove all

ratified all these transactions. It now appeared, that, notwithstanding
the efforts of the Queen and King, the power of the papacy was effectually
suppressed, and invincible barriers fixed against its
re-establishment. For tho' the jurisdiction of the eccle∣siastics
was, for the present, restored, their property, on which their power much 
<PB N="371" REF="375"/> depended, was irrecoverably lost, and no hopes
remained of recovering it. Even these arbitrary, powerful, and bigotted
princes, while the transactions were yet recent, could not regain to the
church her possessions so lately lost; and no ex∣pedients were left
the clergy for enriching themselves, but those which they had at first
practised, and which had required ages of ignorance, barbarism, and

<P>THE Parliament having secured their own possessions,
were more indifferent with regard to religion, or even the lives of their
fellow citizens; and they re∣vived the old sanguinary laws against
heretics<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 &amp;
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> &amp; M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r. c 6.</NOTE>, which had been rejected in the former
Parliament. They also enacted several laws against seditious words and
rumours<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></NOTE>; and they made it treason to imagine or
attempt the death of Philip, during his marriage with the Queen<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></NOTE>. Each Parliament hitherto had been in∣duced to go a step
farther than their predecessors; but none of them had entirely lost all
regard to national interests. Their hatred against the Spaniards, as well
as their suspicion of Philip's pretensions, still prevailed; and tho'
the Queen attempted to get her husband declared presumptive heir of the
crown, and to have the admi∣nistration put into his hands; she failed in
all her hopes, and could not so much as procure the Parliament's consent to
his coronation<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Godwin,
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>. Baker, p.
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>.</NOTE>. All attempts likewise
to procure subsidies from the commons, in order to support the emperor in
his war against France, proved fruitless; and the usual animosity and
jealousy of the English against that kingdom, seemed to have given
place, for the present, to like passions against Spain. Philip,
sensible of the prepossessions entertained against him,
endeavoured to acquire popularity, by procuring the release of se∣veral
prisoners of distinction; the lord Henry Dudley, Sir George Harper, Sir
Nicholas Throcmorton, Sir Edmond Warner, Sir William St. Lo, Sir Nicholas
Arnold, Harrington, Tremaine, who had been consined from the suspicions
or <PB N="372" REF="376"/> resentment of the court<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Heylin, p. 39. Burnet, vol. II. p. 287. Stowe, p. 626.</NOTE>. But
nothing was more agreeable to the nation than his protection of the lady
Elizabeth, from the spite and malice of the Queen, and the restoring her to
her liberty. This measure was not the effect of any ge∣nerosity in Philip,
a sentiment of which he was wholly incapable; but of a re∣fined policy, which
made him foresee, that, if that princess were put to death, the next lawful
heir was the Queen of Scots, whose succession would for ever an∣nex
England to the crown of France. The earl of Devonshire also reaped some
be∣nefit from the affected popularity of Philip, and recovered his liberty: But
that nobleman finding himself exposed to suspicion, begged
permission to travel<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Heylin, p. 40. Godw<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, p.

died in Padua, from poison, as is pretended, given him by the imperialists.
He was the eleventh and last earl of Devonshire of that noble fa∣mily,
allied to the royal family of France.</P>
<P>THE Queen's extreme desire of having issue, had made her
fondly give credit to any appearance of her pregnancy; and when the legate was
introduced to her, she fancied, that she felt the embryo stir in her
womb. Her flatterers compared this motion of the infant to that of John the
Baptist, who leaped in his mother's belly at the salutation of the
virgin<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. II. p. 292. Godwin, p. 3<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>8.</NOTE>. Dispatches were
immediately sent to in∣form foreign courts of this event: Orders were
issued to give public thanks: Great rejoicings were made: The family of the
young prince was already set∣tled<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Heylin, p.
46.</NOTE>; for the catholics held themselves assured that the child was
to be a male: And Bonner, bishop of London, made public prayers be said,
that Heaven would please to render him beautiful, vigorous, and witty. But
the nation re∣mained still somewhat incredulous; and men were persuaded,
that the Queen laboured under infirmities, which rendered her incapable of
having children. Her infant proved only the commencement of a dropsy, which
the disor∣dered state of her health had brought upon her. The belief,
however, of her pregnancy was still maintained with all possible care;
and was one artifice, by which Philip endeavoured to support his authority in
the kingdom. <MILESTONE N="1555" UNIT="year"/> The Par∣liament passed a
law, which, in case of the Queen's death, appointed him protector during the
minority; and the King and Queen, finding they could<NOTE PLACE="marg">16

Westminster Hall, and dis∣solved them.</P>
<P>THERE happened a remarkable assair this session, which
must not be passed over in silence. Several members of the lower
house, dissatisfied with the mea∣sures of the Parliament, but finding
themselves unable to prevent them, made a <PB N="373" REF="377"/>

Judging of the matter by the subse∣quent pretensions of the house of

of the Queen's ministers must be regarded as a breach of privilege; but

</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE success which Gardiner, from his cautious and prudent
conduct, had met with in governing the Parliament, and engaging them both to
ap∣prove of the Spanish alliance, and the re-establishment of the ancient
religion, two points, to which, it was believed, they bore an extreme
aversion, had so raised his character for wisdom and policy, that his
opinion was received as an oracle in the Queen's councils; and his authority,
as it was always great in his own party, no longer suffered any opposition
or controul. Cardinal Pole himself, tho' more beloved on account of his
virtue and candour, and tho' supe∣rior in birth and station, had not equal
weight in public deliberations; and while his learning, piety, and humanity
were extremely respected, he was represented more as a good man than a
great minister. A very important question was fre∣quently debated, before
the Queen and council, by these two ecclesiastics; whe∣ther the laws
lately revived against heretics should be put in execution, or should
only be employed to restrain, by terror, the bold attempts of these
zealots. Pole was very sincere in his religious principles; and tho' his
moderation had made <PB N="374" REF="378"/> him be suspected at Rome of a
tendency towards Lutheranism; he was seriously persuaded of the
catholic doctrines, and thought that no consideration of human policy ought
ever to come in competition with such important interests. Gar∣diner, on
the contrary, had always made his religion subservient to his schemes of
safety or advancement; and by his unlimited complaisance to Henry, he had
shown, that had he not been pushed to extremity under the late minority, he
was sufficiently disposed to make a sacrifice of his principles to the
established theo∣logy. This was the well-known character of these two
great counsellors; yet such is the prevalence of temper above system,
that the benevolent disposition of Pole led him to advise a toleration of
the heretical tenets which he highly blamed; while the severe manners of
Gardiner inclined him to support, by persecution, that religion which, at
the bottom, he regarded with great indifference<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> p 17.</NOTE>. This circumstance
of public conduct was of the highest importance; and from being the object of
deliberation in the council, it soon became the subject of discourse
throughout the nation. We shall represent, in a few words, the topics by
which each side supported, or might have supported, their scheme of
policy; and shall display the opposite reasons which have been
employed, with regard to an ar∣gument that ever has been, and ever will be so
much canvassed.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Reasons for and against
toleration.</NOTE> THE practice of persecution, said the defenders of
Pole's opinion, is the scan∣dal of all religion; and the theological
animosity, so fierce and violent, far from being an argument of men's
conviction in their opposite tenets, is a certain proof, that they have never
reached any serious persuasion with regard to these remote and
sublime subjects. Even those who are the most impatient of
contradiction in other controversies, are mild and moderate in comparison
of polemical divines; and wherever a man's knowlege and experience give him a
perfect assurance of his own opinion, he regards with contempt, rather than
anger, the opposition and mistakes of others. But while men zealously
maintain what they neither clearly comprehend, nor entirely believe, they are
shaken in their imagined saith, by the opposite persuasion, or even
doubts of other men; and vent on their an∣tagonists that impatience which is
the natural result of so disagreeable a state of the understanding.
They then embrace easily any pretence for representing op∣pon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ts as impious and prophane; and if they
can also find a colour for co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nect∣ing this violence with the interests of civil government,
they can no longer be restrained from giving uncont<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ouled scope to vengeance and resentment. But
surely never enterprize was more unfortunate than that of founding per<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e∣cution upon policy, or endeavouring,
for the sake of peace, to settle an entire uni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ormity of opinion, in questions which, of all others,
are least subjected to <PB N="375" REF="379"/> the criterion of human
reason. The universal and uncontradicted prevalence of one opinion in
religious subjects, can only be owing at first to the stupid igno∣rance
and barbarism of the people, who never indulge themselves in any
specula∣tion or enquiry; and there is no other expedient for maintaining that
uniformity, so fondly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ought
after, but by banishing for ever all curiosity and all improvement in
science and cultivation. It may not, indeed, appear difficult to ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ck, by a steddy severity, the
first beginnings of controversy; but besides that this policy exposes
for ever the people to all the abject terrors of superstition, and the
magi∣strate to the endless encroachments of ecc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>esiastics, it also renders men
so delicate, that they can never endure to hear of opposition; and they
will sometime pay dearly for that false tranquility in which they have been
so long indulged. As healthful bodies are ruined by too nice a regimen, and
are thereby rendered inca∣pable of bearing the unavoidable incidents of human
life; a people who never were allowed to imagine, that their principles could
be contested, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly out into the
most outrageous violence when any event (and such events are common)
produces a faction among their clergy, and gives rise to any difference in
tenet or opinion. But whatever may be said in favour of suppressing, by
persecution, the first be∣ginnings of here<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y, no solid argument can be alledged for extending severity
to∣wards multitudes, or endeavouring, by capital punishments, to extirpate an
opi∣nion, which has diffused itself thro' men of every rank and station.
Besides the extreme barbarity of such an attempt, it proves commonly
ineffectual to the pur∣pose intended; and serves only to make men more
obstinate in their persuasion, and to encrease the number of their
proselytes. The melancholy with which the
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ear of death, torture, and
persecution inspires the sectaries, is the proper dispo∣sition for
fostering religious zeal: The pr spect of eternal reward<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, when brought near, overpowers the
dread of temporal punishment: The glory of martyrdom stimulates all the
more furious zealots, especially the leaders and preachers▪ Where a
violent animosity is excited by oppression, men pass naturally from
hat∣ing the persons of their tyrants, to a more violent abhorrence of their
doctrine▪ And the spectat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rs, moved with pity towards the supposed martyrs, are naturally
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>educed to embrace those
principles which can inspire men with a constancy that appears almost
supernatural. Open the door to toleration, the mutual hatred re∣laxes among
the sectaries; their attachment to their particular religion decays▪ the
common occupations and pleasures of life succeed to the a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rimony of disputation; and the
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ame man, who, in other
circumstances, would have braved slames and tortures, is engaged to change
his religion from the smallest prospect of favour and advancement, or
even from the frivolous hopes of becom∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>g more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ashionable in
his principles. If any exception can be admitted to this <PB N="376" REF="380"/>
maxim of toleration, it will only be where a theology altogether new, no way
connected with the ancient religion of the state, is imported from foreign
coun∣tries, and may easily, at one blow, be eradicated, without leaving the
seeds of future innovations. But as this instance would involve some
apology for the an∣cient pagan persecutions, or for the extirpation of
Christianity in China and Ja∣pan; it ought surely, on account of this
detested consequence, to be rather bu∣ried in eternal silence and
oblivion.</P>
<P>THO' these arguments appear entirely satisfactory, yet
such is the subtilty of human wit, that Gardiner, and the other enemies to
toleration, were not reduced to silence, and they still found topics on
which to support the controversy. The doctrine, said they, of liberty of
conscience is founded on the most flagrant im∣piety, and supposes
such an indifference among all religions, such an obscurity in
theological doctrines, as to render the church and magistrate incapable of
distin∣guishing, with certainty, the dictates of Heaven from the mere
fictions of hu∣man imagination. If the Divinity reveals principles to mankind,
he will surely give a criterion by which they may be ascertained; and a
prince, who knowingly allows these principles to be perverted, or
adulterated, is infinitely more criminal than if he gave permission for the
vending of poison, under the shape of bread, to all his subjects.
Persecution may, indeed, seem better calculated to make hy∣pocrites than
converts; but experience teaches us, that the habits of hypocrisy often turn
into reality; and the children at least, ignorant of their parents
dissi∣mulation, may happily be educated in more orthodox tenets. It is
absurd, in op∣position to considerations of such unspeakable
importance, to plead the temporal and frivolous interests of civil society;
and if matters be thoroughly examined, even that topic will not appear so
certain and universal in favour of toleration as by some i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> is represented. Where sects
arise, whose fundamental principle on all sides, is to execr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>te, and abhor, and damn, and extirpate
each other; what choice has the magistrate left but to take party, and by
rendering one sect entirely prevalent, restore, at least for a time, the
public tranquillity? The political body, being here s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ly, must not be treated as if it were in a state of
found health; and an affected neutrality in the prince, or even a cool
preference, may serve only to en∣courag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the hopes of all the sects, and keep alive their animosity.
The pro∣testants, far from tol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rating the religion of their ancestors, regard it as an impi∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> and detestable idolatry; and during
the late minority, when they were en∣tirely mast<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>, enac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> very
severe, tho' not capital, punishments against all ex∣ercise of the
catholic worship, and even against such as barely abstained from their
profane rites and sacraments. Nor are instances wanting of their endeavours
to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> an imagined orthodoxy by
the most rigorous executions: Calvin has <PB N="377" REF="381"/> burned
Servetus at Geneva: Cranmer brought Arians and Anabaptists to the stake:
And if persecution of any kind is to be admitted, the most bloody and
violent will surely be allowed the most justifiable, as the most

irritate the sects, with∣out disabling them from resistance: But the
stake, the wheel, or the gibbet, must soon terminate in the extirpation
or banishment of all the heretics, who are in∣clined to give disturbance,
and in the entire silence and submission of the rest.</P>
<P>THE arguments of Gardiner being more agreeable to the cruel
bigotry of Mary and Philip, were better received; and tho' Pole pleaded, as is
affirmed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. II. Heylin, p. 47. It is not
likely, however, that Charles gave any such advice: For he himself was at

recommended it to his daughter-in-law, not to practise violence against the

endeavouring thro' his whole life to extirpate heresy, had, in the end,
reaped nothing but confusion and disappointment, the scheme of
to∣leration was entirely rejected. It was determined to let loose the laws in
their full rigour against the reformed religion; and England was soon
filled with scenes of horror, which have ever since rendered the catholic
religion the object of general detestation, and which prove, that no human
depravity can equal revenge and cruelty, covered with the mantle of
religion.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Violent per∣secution in England.</NOTE> THE
persecutors began with Rogers, who was prebendary of St. Paul's, and a man
eminent in his party for virtue as well as for learning. Gardiner's plan was
first to attack men of that character, whom, he hoped, terror would bend to
sub∣mission, and whose example, either of punishment or recantation,
would natu∣rally have influence on the multitude: But he found a perseverance
and courage in Rogers, which it may seem strange to find in human nature,
and of which all ages, and all sects, do notwithstanding furnish many
examples. Rogers, beside the care of his own preservation, lay under other
very powerful temptations to compliance: He had a wife, whom he tenderly loved,
and ten children; yet such was his serenity after his condemnation, that
the jailors, it is said, waked him from a sound sleep, when the hour of
his execution approached. He had desired to see his wise before he died;
but Gardiner told him, that he was a priest; he could not possibly have a
wife: Thus joining insult to cruelty. Rogers was burnt in Smithfield<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Fox, vol. III. p. 119. Burnet, vol. II. p.
302.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>HOOPER, bishop of Glocester, had been tried at the same
time with Rogers; but was sent to his own diocese to be executed. This
circumstance was contrived to <PB N="378" REF="382"/> strike a greater
terror into his flock; but it was a source of satisfaction to Hooper, who
rejoiced in giving testimony, by his death, to that doctrine which he had
formerly taught them. When he was tied to the stake, a stool was set
before him, and the Queen's pardon laid upon it, which it was still in his
power to ac∣cept by his recantation: But he ordered it to be removed; and
chearfully pre∣pared himself for that dreadful punishment to which he was
condemned. He suffered it in its full severity: The wind, which was
vehement, blew the flame of the reeds from his body: The faggots were green,
and did not kindle easily: All his lower parts were consumed before his
vitals were at∣tacked: One of his hands dropt off: With the other he continued
to beat his breast: He was heard to pray and exhort the people, till his
tongue, swoln with the violence of the agony, could no longer permit him
utterance. He was three quarters of an hour in torture, which he bore with
inflexible constancy<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Fox, vol. III. p. 145,
&amp;c. Burnet, vol. II. p. 302. Heylin, p. 48, 49. Godwin, p. 349.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>SANDERS was burned at Coventry: A pardon was also offered him;
but he rejected it, and embraced the stake, saying, 
<Q REND="inline">"Welcome the cross of Christ; welcome
everlasting life."</Q> Taylor, parson of Hadley, was consumed by flames
in that place, amidst his ancient friends and parishioners. When tied to
the stake, he repeated a psalm in English: One of his guards struck him
on the mouth, and bid him speak Latin: Another, in a rage, gave him a blow on
the head with his halbert, which happily put an end to his▪torments.</P>
<P>THERE was one Philpot, archdeacon of Winchester,
possessed of such zeal for orthodoxy, that having been engaged in a
dispute with an Arian, he spit in his adversary's face, to show the
great detestation which he had entertained against that heresy. He
afterwards wrote a treatise to justify this unmannerly expression of
zeal; and he said, that he was led to it, in order to relieve the sorrow
con∣ceived from such horrid blasphemy, and to signify how unworthy such
a mis∣creant was of being admitted into the company of any christian<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Strype, vol. III. p. 261. and Coll. N<SUP>o</SUP> 58.</NOTE>. Philpot was a
protestant; and falling now into the hands of people as zealous as himself,
but more powerful, he was condemned to the flames, and suffered at
Smithfield.</P>
<P>THE article upon which almost all the protestants were
condemned, was, their refusal to acknowlege the real presence. Gardiner,
who had vainly expected, that a few examples would strike a terror into the
reformers, finding the work daily multiply upon him, devolved the invidious
office on others, chiefly on Bon∣ner, a man of profligate manners, and of a
brutal character, who seemed to re∣joice in the torments of the unhappy
sufferers<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Heylin, p. 47, 48.</NOTE>. He sometimes
whipped the pri∣soners <PB N="379" REF="383"/> soners with his own hands,
till he was tired with the violence of the exercise: He tore out the beard of
a weaver, who refused to relinquish his religion; and that he might give
him a specimen of burning, he held his hand to the candle, till the sinews
and veins snrunk and burst<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Fox, vol. III. p.
187.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IT is needless to be particular in enumerating all the horrid
cruelties practised in England during the course of three years that
these persecutions lasted: The savage barbarity on the one hand, and
the patient constancy on the other, are so similar in all these
martyrdoms, that the narration, very little agreeable in itself, would never
be relieved by any variety. Human nature appears not, on any oc∣casion, so
detestable, and at the same time so absurd, as in these religious
persecu∣tions, which sink men below infernal spirits in wickedness, and
below the beasts in folly. A few instances only may be worth preserving,
in order, if possible, to warn zealous bigots, for ever to avoid such
odious and such fruitless barbarity.</P>
<P>FERRAR, bishop of St. David's, was burned in his own
diocese; and his ap∣peal to cardinal Pole was not attended to<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 216.</NOTE>. Ridley, bishop of London, and
Latimer, formerly bishop of Worcester, two prelates celebrated for learning
and virtue, perished together in the same flames at Oxford, and supported
each other's constancy by their mutual exhortations. Latimer, when tied to
the stake, called to his companion, 
<Q REND="inline">"Be of good comfort, brother, we shall this
day kindle such a torch in England, as, I trust in God, shall never be
extinguished."</Q> The executioners had been so merciful (for that clemency
may more naturally be ascribed to them than to the religious zealots) as to
tye bags of gunpowder about these prelates, in order to put a speedy period
to their tortures: The explosion imme∣diately killed Latimer, who was in an
extreme old age: Ridley continued alive during some time in the midst of
the flames<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. II. p. 318. Heylin, p.
52.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>ONE Hunter, a young man of nineteen, an apprentice, having been
seduced by a priest into a dispute, had unwarily denied the real
presence. Sensible of his danger, he immediately concealed himself; and
Bonner laying hold of his fa∣ther, threatened him with the greatest
seve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ties, if he did not produce
the young man to stand his tryal. Hunter, hearing the vexations to which his
father was exposed, voluntarily delivered himself to Bonner, and was
condemned to the flames by that barbarous prelate.</P>
<P>THOMAS Haukes, when conducted to the stake, agreed with his
friends, that if he found the torture tolerable, he would make them a signal
to that purpose in the midst of the flames. His zeal for the cause in
which he suffered, so support∣ed him, that he stretched out his arms,
the signal agreed on; and in that posture <PB N="380" REF="384"/> he
expired<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Fox, vol. III. p. 265.</NOTE>. This example,
with many others of like constancy, encouraged multitudes, not only to
suffer, but even to aspire to martyrdom.</P>
<P>THE tender sex itself, as they have commonly a greater
propensity to religion, produced many instances of the most inflexible
courage in supporting the profes∣sion of it, against all the fury of
the persecutors. One execution in particular was attended with
circumstances which, even at that time, excited astonishment, by reason
of their unusual barbarity. A woman in Guernsey, being near the time of her
labour when brought to the stake, was thrown into such agitation by the
torture, that her belly burst, and she was delivered in the midst of the
flames. One of the guards immediately snatched the infant from the fire, and
attempted to save it: But a magistrate who stood by, ordered it to be
thrown back; being determined, he said, that nothing should survive which
sprung from such an ob∣stinate and heretical parent<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 747. Heylin, p 57. Burnet, vol. II. p. 337.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE persons condemned to these punishments were not
convicted for teaching, or dogmatizing, contrary to the established
religion: They were seized merely on suspicion; and articles being
offered them to subscribe, they were immediately, upon their refusal,
condemned to the flames<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 306.</NOTE>.
Those instances of barbarity, so unusual in the nation, excited horror;
the constancy of the martyrs was the object of admiration; and as men have a
principle of equity engraven in their minds, which even false religion is not
able totally to obliterate, they were shock∣ed to see persons of probity,
of honour, of pious dispositions, exposed to pu∣nishments more severe
than were inflicted on the greatest ruffians, for crimes sub∣versive of
civil society. To exterminate the whole protestant party, was known to be
impossible; and nothing could appear more iniquitous, than to subject to
torture, the most conscientious and courageous among them; and allow the
cowards and hypocrites to escape. Each martyrdom, therefore, was equivalent
to a hundred sermons against popery; and men either avoided such horrid
spec∣tacles, or returned from them full of a violent, tho' secret,
indignation against the persecutors. Repeated orders were sent from the
council, to quicken the dili∣gence of the magistrates in searching after
heretics; and, in some places, the gentry were obliged to countenance, by
their presence, these barbarous executi∣ons. The violences tended only to
render the Spanish government daily more odious; and Philip, sensible of
the hatred which he incurred, endeavoured to remove the reproach from himself
by a very gross artifice: He ordered his con∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>essor to deliver in his presence a sermon in favour of
toleration: a doctrine <PB N="381" REF="385"/> somewhat extraordinary in a
Spanish friar<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Heylin, p. 56.</NOTE>. But the
court, finding that Bonner, however shameless and savage, would not bear
alone the whole infamy, soon threw off the mask; and the unrelenting temper
of the Queen, as well as of the King, appeared without controul. A bold step
was even taken towards the intro∣duction of the inquisition into England. As
the bishops' courts, tho' extremely arbitrary, and not bound by any ordinary
forms of law, appeared not to be invested with sufficient power, a
commission was appointed by authority of the Queen's prerogative, more
effectually to extirpate heresy. Twenty-one persons were named; but any
three were armed with the powers of the whole. The com∣mission runs in
these terms; 
<Q REND="inline">"That since many false rumours were
published among the subjects, and many heretical opinions were also
spread among them, therefore they were to enquire into those, either by
presentments by witnesses, or any other political way they could
devise, and to search after all heresies; the bringers in, the sellers,
the readers of all heretical books: They were to examine and punish all
misbehaviours or negligences, in any church or chap∣pel; and to try all
priests that did not preach the sacrament of the altar; all persons that
did not hear mass, or come to their parish church to service, that would
not go in processions, or did not take holy bread or holy water: And if
they found any that did obstinately persist in such heresies, they
were to put them into the hands of their ordinaries, to be punished according
to the spiri∣tual laws: Giving the commissioners full power to proceed,
as their discre∣tions and consciences should direct them, and to use
all such means as they would invent for the searching of the premises;
empowering them also to call before them such witnesses as they
pleased, and to force them to make oath of such things as might discover
what they sought after<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. II. Coll.
32.</NOTE>."</Q> Some civil powers were also given the commissioners to
punish vagabonds and quarrelsome persons.</P>
<P>TO bring the methods of proceeding in England nearer the
practice of the inquisition, letters were written to the lord North, and
others, enjoining them, 
<Q REND="inline">"To put to the torture such obstinate
persons as would not confess, and there to order them at their
discretion<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol III. p.
243.</NOTE>."</Q> Secret spies also, and informers, were em∣ployed,
according to the practice of that iniquitous tribunal. Instructions were
given to the justices of peace, 
<Q REND="inline">"That they should call secretly before them
one or two honest persons within their limits, or more, at their
disoretion, and command them by oath, or otherwise, that they shall
secretly learn and search out such persons as shall evil-behave
themselves in church, or idly, or shall d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>spise openly by words, the King's or Queen's proceedings, or go
about to <PB N="382" REF="386"/> make any commotion, or tell any seditious
tales or news. And also, that the same persons so to be appointed,
shall declare to the same justices of peace, the ill behaviour of lewd
disordered persons, whether it shall be for using un∣lawful games, and
such other light behaviour of such suspected persons: And that the
same information shall be given secretly to the justices; and the
same justices shall call such accused persons before them, and
examine them, with∣out declaring by whom they were accused. And that the
same justices shall, upon their examination, punish the offenders,
according as their offences shall appear, upon the accusement and
examination, by their dis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>retion,
either by open punishment or by good abearing<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. III. p. 246, 247.</NOTE>."</Q> In some respects,
this tyrannical edict even exceeded the oppression of the inquisition; by
introducing into every part of government, the same iniquities which that
tribunal practises only for the extirpation of heresy, and which are, in
some measure, necessary, wherever that end is earnestly
pursued.</P>
<P>BUT the court had devised a more expeditious and summary
method of sup∣pressing heresy than even the inquisition itself.
They issued a proclamation against books of heresy, treason, and
sedition; and declared, 
<Q REND="inline">"That whosoever had any of these books, and
did not presently burn them, without reading them, or shewing them to any
other person, should be esteemed rebels; and without any farther delay,
be executed by martial law<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. II. p.
363. Heylin, p. 79.</NOTE>."</Q> From the state of the Eng∣lish government,
during that period, it is not so much the illegality of these pro∣ceedings,
as their violence and their pernicious tendency, which ought to be the object
of our censure.</P>
<P>WE have thrown together almost the whole transactions
against heretics, tho' carried on during a course of three years; that we
may be obliged, as little as possible, to return to such shocking
violences and barbarities. It is computed, that in that time two hundred and
seventy-seven persons suffered by fire; besides those punished by
imprisonment, fines, and con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iscations. Among those who suffered by fire, were five
bishops, twenty-one clergymen, eight lay gentlemen, eighty-four tradesmen,
one hundred husbandmen, servants, and labourers, fifty-five women, and four
children. This persevering cruelty appears astonishing; yet is it much
inferior to what has been practised in other countries. A great au∣thor<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Father Paul, lib▪ 5.</NOTE>computes, that in the Low
Countries alone, from the time that the edict of Charles the fifth was
promulgated against the reformers, there had been fifty thousand persons
hanged, beheaded, buried alive, or burnt, on account of reli∣gion; 
<PB N="383" REF="387"/> and that in France the number had also been
considerable. Yet in both countries, as the same author subjoins, the
progress of the new opinions, instead of being checked, was rather
forwarded by these persecutions.</P>
<P>THE burning of heretics was a very natural method of reconciling
the king∣dom to the church of Rome, and little sollicitation was requisite
to engage the pope to receive the strayed flock, from which he reaped such
profit: Yet was there a solemn embassy sent to Rome, consisting of
Sir Anthony Brown, created viscount Montacute, the bishop of Ely, and Sir
Edward Carne; in order to carry the submission of England, and beg to be
readmitted into the bosom of the catholic church<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Heylin, p. 45.</NOTE>. Paul the fourth, after a short interval,
now filled the papal chair; the most haughty pontiff, that during several
ages had been elevated to that dignity. He was offended, that Mary still
retained among her titles, that of Queen of Ireland; and he affirmed that it
belonged to him alone, as he saw proper, either to erect new kingdoms or
abolish the old: But to avoid all dispute with the new converts, he thought
proper to erect Ireland into a king∣dom, and then admitted the title, as if it
had been his own concession. This was an usual artifice of the popes to
give allowance to what they could not pre∣vent<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Heylin, p. 45. Father Paul, lib. 5.</NOTE>, and then pretend, that
persons, while they exercised their own power, were only acting by
authority from the papacy. And tho' Paul had at first in∣tended to oblige
Mary formally to recede from this title, before he would be∣stow it upon her;
he found it wiser to proceed in a more political, and less haughty
manner<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Father Paul, lib 5</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE other point of discussion between the pope and the
English ambassadors was not so easily terminated. Paul insisted,
that the property and possessions of the church should be restored
even to the uttermost farthing: That whatever be∣longed to God, could never
by any law be converted to profane uses, and every person who detained
such possessions was in a state of eternal damnation: That he would
willingly, in consideration of the humble submissions of England, make
them a present of these ecclesiastical revenues; but such a
concession ex∣ceeded his power, and the people might be certain that so
great a profanation of holy things would be a perpetual anathema upon them, and
would blast all their future felicity: That if they would truly show their
filial piety, they must re∣store all the privileges and emoluments of the
Roman church, and Peter's pence among the rest; nor could they expect, that
that apostle would open to them the gates of Paradise, while they detained
from them his possessions on earth<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Father
Paul, lib. 5. Heylin, p. 45.</NOTE>. <PB N="384" REF="388"/> These earnest
remonstrances being transmitted to England, tho' they had little influence
on the nation, operated powerfully on the Queen; and she was deter∣mined, in
order to ease her conscience, to restore all the church lands which were
still in the possession of the crown; and the more to express her
zeal, she erected anew some convents and monasteries, notwithstanding
the low condition of the public revenues. When this measure was debated in
council, some members objected, that if such a considerable part of the
revenue was dismembered, the dignity of the crown would fall to decay: But
the Queen replied, that she pre∣ferred the salvation of her soul to ten
such kingdoms as England<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Heylin, p. 53, 65.
Hollingshed, p. 1127. Speed, p. 826.</NOTE>. These im∣prudent measures
would not probably have taken place so easily, had it not been for the
death of Gardiner, which happened about this time: The seals were given to
Heathe, archbishop of York; that an ecclesiastic might still be
possessed of that high office, and be better enabled by his authority
to forward the perse∣cutions against the reformed.</P>
<P>THESE persecutions were now become extremely odious to the
nation; and the<NOTE PLACE="marg">21st October. A Parliament.</NOTE>effects
of the public discontents appeared in the new Parliament, which was
summoned to meet at Westminster<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Burnet,
vol. II. p. 32<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE>. A bill was
passed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 and 3 Phil. and Mar. cap.

impropriations which remained in the hands of the crown; but tho' this matter
directly concerned none but the Queen herself, great opposition was made to
the bill in the house of commons. An application being made for a subsidy
during two years, and for two fifteenths, the latter was refused by the
commons; and many members said, that while the crown was thus despoiling
itself of its revenues, there was no end of bestow∣ing riches upon it. The
Parliament rejected a bill for obliging the exiles to return under certain
penalties, and another for incapacitating such as were remiss in the
prosecution of heresy from being justices of peace. The Queen
finding<NOTE PLACE="marg">9th Decem∣ber.</NOTE>the intractable humour of the
commons, thought proper to dissolve the Par∣liament.</P>
<P>THE spirit of opposition, which began to prevail in
Parliament, was likely to be the more vexatious to Mary, as she was
otherwise in very bad humour on ac∣count of her husband's absence, who,
tired of her importunate love and jealousy, and finding his authority
extremely limited in England, had laid hold of the first opportunity to leave
her, and had gone over last summer to the emperor in Flan∣ders. The
indifference and neglect of her husband, added to the disappoint∣ment in
her imagined pregnancy, threw her into a deep melancholy; and she 
<PB N="385" REF="389"/> gave vent to her spleen by enforcing daily the
persecutions against the protestants, and even by expressions of rage
against all her subjects, by whom she knew her∣self to be hated, and
whose opposition, in refusing an entire compliance with Philip, was the
cause, she believed, why he had alienated his affections from her, and
afforded her so little of his company. The less return her love met with,
the more it increased; and she passed most of her time in solitude,
where she gave vent to her passion, either in tears, or in writing fond
epistles to Philip, who seldom returned her any answer, and scarce
deigned to counterfeit any sentiment of love or even of gratitude towards
her. The chief part of government, to<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Queen's
extortions.</NOTE>which she attended, was the extorting money from her
people, in order to satisfy his demands; and as the Parliament had granted
her but a small supply, she had recourse to expedients the most
violent and most irregular. She levied a loan of 60,000 pounds upon a
thousand persons, of whose compliance, either on account of their riches
or their affections to her, she held herself best assured: But that
sum not sufficing, she exacted a general loan of an hundred pounds
a∣piece on every one who possessed twenty pounds a year. This grievous
impo∣sition lay very heavy on the gentry, who were obliged, many of them, to
re∣trench their expences, and dismiss their servants, in order to enable
them to comply with her commands: And as these servants, accustomed to
idleness, and having no means of subsistance, betook themselves very
commonly to theft and robbery, the Queen published a proclamation, by which
she obliged their former masters to take them back to their service. She
levied 60,000 marks from 7000 yeomen, who had not contributed to the former
loan; and she exacted 36,000 pounds more from the merchants. In order to
engage some Londoners to comply the more willingly with her multiplied
extortions, she passed an edict, prohibiting, for four months, the
exporting any English cloths or kerseys for Flande<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s; an expedient which procured a good market for such
as had already sent any quan∣tity of cloth thither. Her rapaciousness
engaged her to give endless disturbance and interruption to commerce. The
English company settled in Antwerp having refused her a loan of 40,000
pounds, she dissembled her r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sentment, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ill she
found, that they had bought and shipped great quantities of cloth for A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t∣werp fair, which was approac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing: She then laid an embargo on the ships, and

prohibited entirely the foreigners to make any exportation; and received, from
the English merchants, in consideration of this iniquity, the sum of
50,000 pounds, and an imposition of four crowns on each piece of cloth which
they should export. She attempted to borrow great fums abroad; but her credit
ran so low, that, tho' she offered 14 per cent▪ to the city of Antwerp
for a loan of 30,000 pounds, she could not obtain it, till she

represented how much preferable it was to govern, by affection rather than
fear, the nations subjected to his dominion. The cool reflections of age now
discovered to him the emptiness of his former pursuits; and he found,
that the vain schemes of extending his empire had been the source of
endless opposition and disappointment, had kept himself, his
neighbours, and his subjects in perpetual inquietude, and had frustrated
the sole end of government, the felicity of the nations committed to his
care; an object which meets with no opposition, and which, if steddily
pursued, can alone con∣vey a lasting and solid satisfaction.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1556" UNIT="year"/> A FEW months after, he
resigned to Philip his other dominions; and embark∣ing on board a fleet,
sailed to Spain, and took his journey to St. Just, a mo∣nastery in
Estramedura, which, being situated in a happy climate, and amidst the
greatest beauties of nature, he had chosen for the place of his retreat. 
<PB N="387" REF="391"/> When he arrived at Burgos, he found, by the thinness
of his court, and the ne∣gligent attendance of the Spanish grandees, that he
was no longer emperor; and tho' this observation might convince him still
more of the vanity of the world, and make him more heartily despise what he
had renounced, he sighed to find that all the former adulation and
obeisance had been paid to his fortune, not to his person. With better
reason, was he struck with the ingratitude of his son Philip, who allowed
him to wait a long time for the payment of the small pension which he had
reserved; and this disappointment in his domestic enjoy∣ments gave him a
very sensible concern. He pursued however his resolution with
inflexible constancy; and shutting himself up in his retreat, he exerted
such self∣command, that he restrained even his curiosity from any
enquiry concerning the transactions of the world, which he had entirely
abandoned. The fencing against the pains and infirmities under which he
laboured, occupied a great part of his time; and during the intervals, he
employed his leisure either in examin∣ing the controversies of theology,
with which his age had been so much agitated, and which he had hitherto
considered only in a political light, or in imitating the works of renowned
artists, particularly in mechanics, of which he had always been a great
admirer and encourager. He is said to have here discovered a propensity
to the new doctrines; and to have frequently dropped hints of this unexpected
alteration in his sentiments. Having amused himself with the
con∣struction of clocks and watches, he thence remarked how impracticable the
ob∣ject was, in which he had so much employed himself during his grandeur;
and how impossible that he, who never could frame two machines that would
go exactly alike, could ever be able to make all mankind concur in the same
belief and opinion. He survived his retreat two years.</P>
<P>THE emperor Charles had very early, in the beginning of his
reign, found the difficulty of governing such distant dominions; and he had
made his brother Ferdinand be elected King of the Romans; with a view of his
succeeding to the imperial dignity, as well as to his German dominions. But
having afterwards enlarged his views, and formed plans of aggrandizing his
family, he regreted, that he must dismember such considerable states;
and he endeavoured to engage Ferdinand, by the most tempting offers, and
most earnest sollicitations, to yield up his pretensions in favour of
Philip. Finding his attempts fruitless, he had resigned the imperial crown
with his other dignities; and Ferdinand, according to common form, applied to
the pope for his coronation. The arrogant pontiff refused the demand; and
pretended, that, tho', on the death of an emperor, he was obliged to crown the
prince elected, yet in the case of a resignation, the right devolved to the
holy see, and it belonged to the pope alone to appoint an 
<PB N="388" REF="392"/> emperor. The conduct of Paul was in every thing
conformable to these lofty pretensions. He thundered always in the ears of
all ambassadors, that he stood in no need of the assistance of any
prince, that he was above all pote tates of the earth, that he would not
accustom monarchs to pretend to a familiarity or equality with him, that it
belonged to him to alter and regulate kingdoms, that he was successor of
those who had deposed kings and emperors, and that, rather than submit to
any thing below his dignity, he would set fire to the four corners of the
world. He went so far, that at table, in the presence of many persons,
and even openly, in a public consistory, he said, that he would not admit
any Kings for his companions; they were all his subjects, and he would hold
them under these feet: So saying, he stamped the ground with his old and
infirm limbs: For he was now past fourscore years of age<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Father Paul, lib. 5.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE world could not forbear making a comparison between
Charles the fifth, a prince, who, tho' educated amidst wars and intrigues of
state, had prevented the decline of age, and had descended from the throne,
in order to set apart an interval for thought and reflection, and a priest,
who in the extremity of old age exulted in his dominion, and from restless
ambition and revenge was throwing all nations into combustion. Paul had
entertained the most inveterate animosity against the house of
Austria; and tho' a truce of five years had been concluded between France and
Spain, he excited Henry by his sollicitations to break it, and promised to
assist him in recovering Naples and the dominions to which he laid claim
in Italy; a project which had ever proved fatal to his prede∣cessors. He
himself engaged in hostilities with the duke of Alva, viceroy of Naples;
and the duke of Guise being sent with forces to support him, the re∣newal
of war between the two crowns seemed almost inevitable. Philip, tho' less
warlike than his father, was no less ambitious; and he trusted, that by the
in∣trigues of the cabinet, where, he believed, his caution and secrecy and
prudence gave him the superiority, he should be able to subdue all his
enemies, and extend his authority and dominion. For this reason, as well as
from the desire of set∣tling his new empire, he was desirous to maintain
peace with France; but when he found, that, without sacrificing his honour,
it was impossible for him to over∣look the hostile attempts of Henry, he
prepared for war with great industry. In order to give himself the more
advantage, he was desirous to embark England in the quarrel; and tho' the
Queen was of herself extremely averse to that de∣sign, he hoped, that the
devoted fondness, which, notwithstanding repeated in∣stances of his
indifference, she still bore him, would effectually second his
applica∣tions. Had the matter indeed depended solely on her, she was
incapable of re∣sisting <PB N="389" REF="393"/> her husband's commands;
but she had little weight with her council, still less with her people;
and her government, which was every day becoming more odious, seemed unable
to support itself even during the most profound tranquillity, much more
if a war was kindled with France, and what seemed an inevitable
consequence, with Scotland, supported by that powerful kingdom.</P>
<P>AN act of barbarity was this year exercised in England, which,
added to many other instances of the same kind, tended to render the
government extremely unpopular. Cranmer had long been detained a prisoner;
but the Queen was now<NOTE PLACE="marg">Execution of Cranmer.</NOTE>determined
to bring him to punishment; and in order the more fully to satiate her
vengeance, she resolved to punish him for heresy, rather than for
treason. He was cited by the pope to stand his trial at Rome; and tho' he
was known to be kept in close custody at Oxford, he was, upon his not
appearing, condemned as contumacious. Bonner, bishop of London, and Thirleby
of Ely, were sent down to Oxford to degrade him; and the former executed that
melancholy ceremony with all the joy and exultation, which suited his
savage nature<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mem. of Cranm p.
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</NOTE>. The revenge of the
Queen, not satisfied with the eternal damnation of Cranmer, which she
believed inevitable, and with the execution of that dreadful sentence to
which he was condemned, prompted her also to seek the ruin of his honour,
and the infamy of his name. Persons were employed to attack him, not in the
way of disputation, against which he was sufficiently armed; but by
flattery, insinuation and address; by representing the dignities to which
his character still entitled him, if he would merit them by a recantation; by
giving hopes of long enjoying those powerful friends, whom his beneficent
disposition had attached to him during the course of his
prosperity<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Heylin, p
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>. M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> p <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</NOTE>. Overcome by the fond love of life, terrified by the
prospect of those tortures which awaited him; he allowed, in an unguarded
hour, the sentiments of nature to prevail over his resolution, and he
agreed to sign a paper, in which he acknowledged the doctrines of the papal
supre∣macy and of the real presence. The court, equally persidious and
cruel, were deter∣mined, that this recantation should avail him nothing; and
they sent orders, that he should be required to acknowledge his errors in
church before the whole people, and that he should thence be immediately led
to execution. Cranmer, whether, that he had received a secret intimation of
their design, or had repented<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>st March.</NOTE>of his weakness, surprized the
audience by a contrary declaration. He said, that he was well apprized of the
obedience which he owed his sovereign and the laws, but this duty extended no
farther than to submit patiently to their commands, and to bear without
resistance whatever hardships they should impose upon him: That a
superior duty, the duly which he owed his Maker, obliged him to speak 
<PB N="390" REF="394"/> truth on all occasions, and not to relinquish, by a
base denial, the holy doctrine which the supreme being had revealed to
mankind: That there was one miscar∣riage in his life, of which, above all
others, he severely repented; the insincere declaration of faith to which
he had the weakness to consent, and which the fear of death alone had
extorted from him: That he took this opportunity of attoning for his error, by
a sincere and open recantation; and was willing to seal with his blood that
doctrine which he firmly believed to be communicated from heaven: And that as
his hand had erred by betraying his heart, it should first be punished,
by a severe but just doom, and should first pay the forfeit of its
of∣fences. He was thence led to the stake amidst the insults of the
catholics; and hav∣ing now summoned up all the force of his mind, he bore
their scorn as well as the torture of his punishment with singular
fortitude. He stretched out his hand, and without betraying, either by his
countenance or motions, the least sign of weakness or even of feeling, he
held it in the flames till it was entirely consumed. His thoughts seemed
entirely occupied with reflections on his former fault; and he called aloud
several times, <HI>This hand has offended.</HI> Satisfied with that
attonement, he then disco∣vered a serenity in his countenance; and when the
fire attacked his body, he seemed to be wholly insensible of his outward
sufferings, and by the force of hope and reso∣lution to have collected his
mind altogether within itself, and to repel the fury of the flames. It is
pretended, that, after his body was consumed, his heart was found entire and
untouched among the ashes; an event, which, as it was the emblem of his
constancy, was fondly believed by the zealous protestants. He was
undoubtedly a man of merit; possessed of learning and capacity; and
adorned with candour, sin∣cerity and beneficence, and all those virtues,
which were fitted to render him useful and amiable in society. His moral
qualities procured him universal re∣spect; and the courage of his
martyrdom, tho' he fell short of the rigid inflexi∣bility observed in many,
made him the hero of the protestant party<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Burnet,
vol. II. p. 331, 332, &amp;c. Godwin, p. 352.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>AFTER Cranmer's death, cardinal Pole, who had now taken
priest's orders, was installed in the see of Canterbury; and was thus by
this office, as well as his commission of legate, placed at the head of the
church of England. But tho' he was averse to all the sanguinary methods of
converting heretics, and esteemed the reformation of the clergy the more
effectual, as the more laudable expedient for that purpose<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. II. 324, 325.</NOTE>; he found his authority too weak
to oppose the barbarous and bigot∣ted disposition of the Queen and of her
counsellors. He himself, he knew, had been suspected of Lutheranism;
and as Paul, the reigning pope, was a furious per∣secutor and his personal
enemy, he was prompted, by the modesty of his dispo∣sition, 
<PB N="391" REF="395"/> to reserve his credit for other occasions, in which
he had a greater proba∣bility of success<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Heylin, p.
68, 69. Burnet, vol. II. p. 327.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1557" UNIT="year"/> THE great object of the Queen
was to engage the nation in the war, which was kindled between France and
Spain; and cardinal Pole, with many other counsellors, very openly and
zealously opposed this measure. Besides insisting on the marriage
articles, which provided against such an attempt, they represented the
violence of the domestic factions in England, and the disordered state of
the finances; and they foreboded, that the tendency of all these measures
was to re∣duce the kingdom to a total dependance on Spanish councils. Philip
had come to London in order to support his partizans; and he told the Queen,
that, if he was not gratified in so reasonable a request, he never more
would set foot in England. This declaration heightened extremely her zeal for
promoting his interests, and overcoming the inflexibility of her council.
After employing other menaces of a more violent nature, she threatened to
dismiss them all from the board, and to appoint counsellors more
obsequious; yet could she not procure a vote for declaring war with France.
At last, one Stafford and some other conspirators were de∣tected in a
design of surprizing Scarborow<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Heylin, p.
72. Burnet, vol II. p 351. Sir James Melvil's Memoirs.</NOTE>; and a
confession being extorted from them, that they had been encouraged by Henry
in that attempt, the Queen's importunity prevailed; and it was determined to
make this act of hostility, with others of a like secret and doubtful
nature, the ground of the quarrel. War<NOTE PLACE="marg">War with
France.</NOTE>was accordingly declared against France; and preparations were
every where made for attacking that kingdom.</P>
<P>THE revenue of England at that time little exceeded 300,000
pounds<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Rosse, Successi d'Inglulte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ra.</NOTE>. Any considerable
supplies could scarce be expected from Parliament, considering the
present disposition of the nation; and as the war would sensibly
diminish the branch of the customs, the finances, it was foreseen, would
fall short even of the ordinary charges of the government; much more, prove
unequal to the vast expences of war. But tho' the Queen owed great arrears to
all her servants, besides the loans extorted from her subjects; these
considerations had no influ∣ence on her, and she continued to levy money in
the same arbitrary and violent manner, which she had formerly practised.
She obliged the city of London to supply her with 60,000 pounds on her
husband's entry; she levied before the legal time the second year's
subsidy voted by Parliament; she issued anew many privy seals, by
which she procured loans from her people; and having equiped 
<PB N="392" REF="396"/> a fleet, which she could not victual by reason of
the dearness of provisions, she seized all the corn she could find in
Suffolk and Norfolk, without paying any price to the owners. By all these
expedients, assisted by the power of pressing, she levied an army
of ten thousand men, which she sent over to the Low Coun∣tries, under the
command of the earl of Pembroke. Meanwhile, in order to prevent any
disturbance at home, many of the most considerable gentry were thrown
into the Tower; and lest they should be known, the Spanish practice was
followed: They were either carried thither in the night-time, or were
hood∣winked and muffled by the guards who conducted them<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Strype's Eccles. Memorials, vol. III. p. 3<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE King of Spain had assembled together an army, which,
after the junction of the English, amounted to above sixty thousand
strong, commanded by Philibert, duke of Savoy, one of the greatest captains
of the age. The constable, Montmo∣rency, who commanded the French army, had
not half the number to oppose him. The duke of Savoy, after menacing
Mariembourg and Rocroy, sat down suddenly before St. Quintin; and as the
place was weak, and ill provided of a garrison, he expected in a few days to
become master of it. But the admiral Coligny, governor of the province,
thinking his honour interested to save so im∣portant a fortress, threw
himself into St. Quintin, with some troops of French and Scotch
gensdarmes; and by his exhortation and example animated the sol∣diers to a
vigorous defence. He dispatched a messenger to his uncle, the
con∣stable, desiring a supply of men; and that general approached the
place with his<NOTE PLACE="marg">10th August.</NOTE>whole army, in order to
facilitate the entry of these succours. But the duke of Savoy falling on
the reinforcement, committed such slaughter upon them, that<NOTE PLACE="marg">Battle of St. Quintin.</NOTE>not above five hundred men got into
the place. He next made an attack on the French army, and put them to a total
rout, killing four thousand men, and dispersing the rest. In this
unfortunate action many of the chief nobility of France were either slain or
taken prisoners: Among the latter was the old con∣stable himself, who
fighting valiantly, and resolute to die rather than survive his defeat, was
surrounded by the enemy, and thus fell alive into their hands. The whole
kingdom of France was thrown into consternation. Paris was attempted to be
fortified in a hurry: And had the Spaniards presently marched thither, it
could not fail to have fallen into their hands. But Philip was very little
enter∣prizing in his character; and he was determined first to take St.
Quintin, in or∣der to secure a communication with his own dominions. A very
little time, it was expected, would finish this enterprize; but the bravery
of Coligny still pro∣longed the siege seventeen days, which proved the
safety of France. Some <PB N="393" REF="397"/> troops were levied and
assembled. Couriers were sent to call the duke of Guise and his army
from Italy: And the French having recovered from their first alarm, put
themselves in a posture of defence. Philip, after taking Ham and
Castelet, found the season so far advanced, that he could attempt no
farther en∣terprize, and he broke up his camp and retired to winter
quarters.</P>
<P>BUT the vigilant activity of Guise, not satisfied with
securing the frontiers, prompted him, in the depth of winter, to attempt an
enterprize which France, during her greatest successes, had always
regarded as impossible, and had never thought of undertaking. Calais was,
in that age, esteemed an impregnable for∣tress; and as it was known to be
the favourite of the English nation, by whom it could easily be
succoured, the recovery of that place by France, was considered as totally
desperate. But Coligny had remarked, that, as the town of Calais was
surrounded with marshes, which, during the winter, were impassable,
except<NOTE PLACE="marg">Calais taken by the French.</NOTE>over a dyke guarded
by two castles, St. Agatha and Newnam bridge, the Eng∣lish were of late
accustomed, on account of the lowness of their finances, to dis∣miss a
great part of the garrison at the end of autumn, and to recall them in the
spring, at which time alone they judged their attendance necessary. On
this circumstance he had founded his design of making a sudden attack on
the place; he had caused it to be secretly surveyed by some engineers;
and a plan of the whole enterprize being found among his papers, it served,
tho' he himself was made pri∣soner on the taking of St. Quintin, to
suggest the project of that undertaking, and to direct the conduct of the
duke of Guise.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1558" UNIT="year"/> SEVERAL bodies of troops
defiled towards the frontiers under various pre∣tences; and the whole being
suddenly assembled, formed an army with which the duke of Guise made an
unexpected march towards Calais. At the same time a great number of French
ships, being ordered▪ into the channel, under colour of cruizing on the
English, composed a fleet which made an attack by sea on the
fortifications. The French assaulted St. Agatha with three thousand
harquebu∣siers; and tho' the garrison made a vigorous defence, they were
soon obliged to abandon the place, and retreat towards Newnam bridge. The
siege of this latter place was immediately undertaken, and at the same time
the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>leet battered the risbank,
which guarded the entry of the harbour; and both these castles seemed
exposed to imminent danger. The governor, lord Wentworth, was a brave
officer, but finding that the greater part of his weak garrison was
enclosed in Newnam or the risbank, he ordered them to capitulate, and to
join him in Calais, which, without their assistance, he was utterly
unable to defend. The garrison of Newnam bridge were so happy as to
effectuate this purpose; but that of the ris∣bank <PB N="394" REF="398"/>
could not obtain such favourable conditions, and were obliged to surrender
themselves prisoners.</P>
<P>THE duke of Guise, now holding the place blockaded by sea
and land, thought himself secure of succeeding in his enterprize; but in
order to prevent all acci∣dents, he delayed not a moment the attack of the
place. He pointed his batteries towards the castle, where he made a large
breach; and having ordered Andelot, Coligny's brother, to drain the
fossée, he commanded an assault, which succeeded, and the
French made a lodgment in the castle. On the night following Went∣worth
attempted to recover this post; but having lost two hundred men in a
fu∣rious attack which he made upon it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Thuan, lib. xx.
c. 2.</NOTE>, he found his garrison so weak, that he was obliged to
capitulate. Ham, and Guisnes fell soon after; and thus the duke of Guise,
in eight days, during the depth of winter, recovered this important place, that
had cost Edward the third a siege of eleven months, at the head of a
numerous army, which had that very campaign been victorious in the battle of
Cressy. The English had held it above two hundred years; and as it gave
them, whenever they pleased, an entry into France, it was regarded as the
most important pos∣session belonging to the crown. The joy of the
French was extreme, as well as the glory acquired by the duke of Guise, who,
at the time that all Europe ima∣gined France to be sunk by the unfortunate
battle of St. Quintin, had, in oppo∣sition to the English, and their allies
the Spaniards, acquired possession of a place which no former King of
France, even during the distractions of the civil wars between the houses
of York and Lancaster, had ever ventured to attempt. The English, on the
other hand, bereaved of this valuable fortress, murmured loud∣ly against
the imprudence of the Queen and her council; who, after engaging in a
fruitless war, for the sake of foreign interests, had thus exposed the
nation to so severe a disgrace. A treasury exhausted by expences, and
burthened with debts; a people divided and dejected; a sovereign negligent of
her people's welfare; were circumstances which, notwithstanding the fair
offers made by Philip, gave them small hopes of recovering Calais. And as the
Scotch, instigated by French councils, began to move on the borders, they
were now necessitated rather to look to their defence at home, than to
think of foreign conquests.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Affairs of Scotland.</NOTE> AFTER the peace,
which, in consequence of King Edward's treaty with Henry, took place between
Scotland and England, the Queen-dowager, under pretence of visiting her
daughter and her relations, made a journey to France, and she carried along
with her the earls of Huntley, Sutherland, Marischal, and many of the
principal nobility. Her secret design was to take measures for engaging
the earl of Arran to resign to her the government of the kingdom; and as her 
<PB N="395" REF="399"/> brothers, the duke of Guise, the cardinal of Lorraine,
and the duke d'Aumale, had uncontrouled authority in the court of France, she
easily persuaded Henry, and by his means the Scotch nobles, to enter into
her measures. Having also gained over Carnegy of Kinnaird, Panter, bishop
of Ross, and Gavin Hamilton, com∣mendator of Kilwinning, three creatures of
the governor's, she persuaded him, by their means, to consent to this
resignation<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>channan, lib <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iv. K<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>h. p. 56. Spotswood, p. 92.</NOTE>;
and when every thing was thus prepared for her purpose, she took her
journey to Scotland, and passed thro' England in her way thither. Edward
received her with great respect and civility; tho' he could not forbear
attempting a renewal of the old treaty for his marriage with her daughter: A
marriage, he said, so happily calculated for the tranquillity, interest,
and security of both kingdoms, and the only means of ensuring a durable
peace between them. For his part, he added, he never could entertain a cordial
amity for any other husband whom she should choose; nor was it easy
for him to forgive a man, who, at the same time that he disappointed so
natural an alliance, had bereaved him of a bride, to whom his affections, from
his earliest infancy, had been entirely engaged. The Queen eluded these
applications, by telling him, that if any measures had been taken
disagreeable to him, they were entirely owing to the imprudence of the duke
of Somerset, who, instead of employing courtesy, caresses, and gentle
offices, the proper means of gaining a young princess, had had recourse to
arms and violence, and had constrained the Scotch nobility to send their
sovereign into France, in order to interest that kingdom in protecting
their liberty and independance<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> p.
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WHEN the Queen-dowager arrived in Scotland, she found the
governor very unwilling to fulfil his engagements; and it was not till after
many delays that he could be persuaded to resign his authority. But finding
that the majority of the young princess was approaching, and that the
Queen-dowager had gained the affections of all the principal nobility, he
thought it more prudent to submit; and having stipulated, that he should
be declared next heir to the crown, and should be fre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d from giving any account of his past
administration, he placed her in possession of the power; and she
thenceforth assumed the name of regent<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> April 1554.</NOTE>. It was an
usual saying of this princess, that provided she could render her
friends happy, and could ensure to herself a good reputation, she was
entirely indifferent what besel her; and tho' this sentiment is greatly
censured by the zealous reformers<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> p. 8<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE>, as being founded wholly on secular motives,
it dis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>overs a mind well
calculated for the administration of kingdoms. D'Oisel, a Frenchman,
celebrated for capacity, had attended her as ambass<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dor from Henry, but in <PB N="396" REF="400"/> reality to
assist her with his counsels in so delicate an undertaking as the
govern∣ment of Scotland; and this man had formed a scheme for laying a
general tax on the kingdom, in order to support a standing military force,
which might at once repulse the inroads of foreign enemies, and check the
turbulence of the Scotch nobility. But tho' some of the courtiers were gained
over to this project, it gave great and general discontent to the nation; and
the Queen-regent, after ingenuously confessing, that it would prove
pernicious to the kingdom, had the prudence to desist from it, and to
trust entirely for her security to the good∣will and affections of her
subjects<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Keith, p. 70. Buchan. lib.
xvi.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THIS laudable purpose seemed to be the chief object of her
administration; yet was she sometimes drawn from it by her connections
with France, and by the influence which her brothers had acquired over her.
When Mary declared war against that kingdom, Henry required the Queen-regent
to take part in the quarrel; and she summoned a convention of states at
Newbottle, and requested them to concur in a declaration of war against
England. The Scotch nobles, who were as jealous of French as the English were
of Spanish influence, refused their assent; and the Queen was obliged
to have recourse to artifice, in order to effectuate her purpose. She
ordered d'Oisel to begin some fortifications at Eymouth, a place which had
been dismantled by the last treaty with Edward; and when the garrison of
Berwic, as she foresaw, made an inroad to prevent the undertaking, she
effectually employed this pretence to inflame the Scotch nation, and to engage
them in hostilities against England<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Buchan.
lib. xvi. Thuan. lib. xix. c. 7.</NOTE>. The enterprize, however, of the Scotch
proceeded no farther than some inroads on the borders; and when d'Oisel, of
himself, conducted artillery and troops to besiege the castle of Werke,
he was recalled, and very sharply rebuked by the council<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Knox, p. 93.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Marriage of the dauphin and the Queen of
Scots.</NOTE> IN order to connect Scotland more closely with France, and to
increase the influence of the latter kingdom, it was thought proper by Henry
to compleat the marriage between the young Queen and the dauphin; and a
deputation was sent by the Scotch Parliament, to assist at this
ceremony, and to settle the terms of the contract. This deputation
consisted of the archbishop of Glasgow, the bi∣shops of Ross and
the Orkneys, the earls of Rothes, and Cassilis, the lords Fleming and
Seton, James Stuart, prior of St. Andrews, natural brother to the Queen, and
Erskine of Dun. The principal conditions recommended to these
commissioners, was to obtain a solemn engagement from the Queen and
dauphin, that they would preserve the laws and privileges of Scotland, and to
procure a renewal of the French King's promise, to support, in case of
the Queen's death, <PB N="397" REF="401"/> the succession of the earl of
Arran, now created duke of Chatolraut. Both these conditions were easily
obtained; but the court of France took a very perfidious step, directly
contrary to these stipulations: They secretly engaged the young Queen to
sign three papers; by one of which she made over the kingdom of Scotland in
gift to the King of France, in case of her decease without children; by
another she mortgaged it to him for a million of crowns of gold, or such
greater sum as he should have expended for her maintenance and support;
and by a third she declared, that whatever deed she had been obliged, or
should hereafter be obliged to perform, relative to the succession of
the crown, it should be entirely invalid, and that her real sense and
intention was contained in the first paper. The marriage was
so∣lemnized<NOTE PLACE="marg">24 April.</NOTE>at Paris: The
commissioners, in the name of the states of Scotland, swore allegiance
to the Queen, and, during the continuance of the marriage, to the King-dauphin,
so he was called: And every thing seemed to proceed with great unanimity
and concord. But the commissioners being required to deli∣ver up the crown,
and other ensigns of royalty, made answer, that they had received no
authority for that purpose; and they soon after set out on their journey
for Scotland. It is remarkable, that before they embarked, four of the
commissioners died, within a few days of each other; and a violent, tho'
absurd suspicion prevailed, that they had been poisoned by orders from
the family of Guise, on account of this refusal<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Buchan. lib. xvi. Keith, p. 75. Spotswood, p. 95.</NOTE>. It was
not considered, that that accident, however rare, might have happened by the
course of nature; and that the present season, tho' not attended with
any pestilential disorder, was, to a singular degree, unhealthy all over
Europe.</P>
<P>THE close alliance between France and Scotland threatned very
nearly the re∣pose and security of England; and it was foreseen, that,
tho' the factions and disor∣ders which might naturally be expected in the
Scotch government during the absence of their sovereign, made its power
less formidable, that kingdom would at least af∣ford to the French a means
of invading England. The Queen, therefore, found it<NOTE PLACE="marg">20th
January▪</NOTE>necessary to summon a Parliament, and to demand of
them some supplies to her ex∣hausted<NOTE PLACE="marg">A
Parliament.</NOTE>exchequer. As such an emergency usually gives great
advantage to the people, and as the Parliaments, during this reign, had
shewn, that, where the liberty and independency of the kingdom were menaced
with imminent danger, they were not entirely overawed by the court; we shall
naturally expect, that the late arbi∣trary methods of extorting money should,
at least, be censured, and, perhaps, some remedy be for the future
provided against them. But such an exorbitant prerogative was at this time
acknowleged to belong to the crown, that, tho' men might complain of its
present abuses, all attempts to retrench it would have been 
<PB N="398" REF="402"/> regarded as the most criminal enterprize; and as that
prerogative involved a large discretionary power, any parliamentary enquiry
into its exercise, would have passed for insolent and presumptuous.
The commons, therefore, without making any reflections on the past, voted,
besides a fifteenth, a subsidy of four shillings in the pound on land,
and two shillings and eight pence on goods. The clergy granted eight
shillings in the pound, payable in four years by equal portions.</P>
<P>THE Parliament also passed an act, confirming all the
sales and grants of crown lands, which were either made already by the Queen,
or should be made during the seven ensuing years. It was easy to
foresee, that, in the Queen's present dis∣position and situation,
this power would be followed by a great alienation of the crown lands; and
nothing could be more contrary to the principles of good go∣vernment, than a
prince armed with very extensive authority, and yet reduced to beggary. This
act met with opposition in the house of commons. One Copley expressed
his fears lest the Queen, under colour of the power there granted, might
alienate the crown from the lawful heir: But his words were thought
<HI>irreverent</HI> to her majesty: He was committed to the custody of the
serjeant at arms; and tho' he expressed sorrow for his offence, he was
not released till the Queen was applied to for his forgiveness.</P>
<P>THE English nation, during this whole reign, were in continual
apprehensions with regard not only to the succession, but the life of
the lady Elizabeth. The violent hatred which the Queen bore her, broke out on
every occasion; and it required all the authority of Philip, as well as her
own great prudence, to prevent the fatal effects of it. The princess retired
into the country; and knowing that she was surrounded with spies, she
past her time wholly in reading and study, intermed∣dled in no
business, and saw very little company. While she remained in this
situa∣tion, which was for the present very melancholy, but which prepared
her mind for those great actions by which her life was afterwards so much
distinguished; pro∣posals of marriage were made her by the Swedish
ambassador, in his master's name. As her first question was, whether
the Queen had been informed of this proposal; the ambassador told her,
that his master thought, as he was a gentle∣man, it was his duty first to
make his addresses to herself; and having obtained her consent, he
would next, as a King, apply to her sister. But the princess would allow
him to proceed no further; and the Queen, after thanking her for this
instance of duty, desired to know how she stood affected to the
Swedish pro∣posal. Elizabeth, tho' exposed to many present dangers and
mortifications, had the magnanimity to reserve herself to better fortune;
and she covered her refusal with professions of a passionate
attachment to a single life, which, she said, she <PB N="399" REF="403"/> infinitely preferred before any other<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. II. Collect. N<SUP>o</SUP> 37.</NOTE>. The princess showed
like prudence in concealing her sentiments of religion, in complying with the
present modes of worship, and in eluding all questions with regard to
that delicate subject<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"> 
<P>The common net at that time, says Sir Richard Baker, for
catching of protestants, was the real presence; and this net was used to
catch the lady Elizabeth: For being asked one time what she thought of the
words of Christ, <HI>This is my body,</HI> whether she thought it the true
body of Christ that was in the sacrament; it is said, that, after some
pausing, she thus answered: 
<Q> 
<L>Christ was the word that spake it;</L> 
<L>He took the bread and brake it;</L> 
<L>And what the word did make it,</L> 
<L>That I believe and take it.</L> </Q> Which, tho' it may
seem but a slight expression, yet hath it more solidness than at
first sight appears; at least it served her turn at that time, to
escape the net, which by direct answer she could not have done. Baker's
Chronicle, p. 320.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE money granted by Parliament, enabled the Queen to fit out a
fleet of a hundred and forty sail, which, being joined by thirty Flemish
ships, and carry∣ing six thousand land forces on board, was sent to
make an attempt on the coast of Brittany. The fleet was commanded by lord
Clinton; the land forces by the earls of Huntingdon and Rutland. But the
equipment of the fleet and army was so dilatory, that the French got
intelligence of the design, and were prepared to receive them. The English
found Brest too well guarded to make an attempt on that place; but landing at
Conquet, they plundered and burnt the town with some adjoining villages, and
were proceeding to commit greater disorders, when Kersimon, a Breton
gentleman, at the head of some militia, fell upon them, put them to rout, and
drove them to their ships with considerable loss. But a small
squadron of ten English ships, had an opportunity of amply revenging this
disgrace upon the French. The Mareschal de Thermes, governor of Calais, had
made an irruption into Flanders, with an army of fourteen thousand men; and
having forced a passage over the river Aa, had taken Dunkirk, and Berg St.
Winoc, and had advanced as far as Newport. But count Egmont coming sud∣denly
upon him, with superior forces, he was obliged to retire; and being
over∣taken by the Spaniards near Gravelines, he chose very skilfully his
ground for the engagement. He fortified his left wing with all the precautions
possible; and posted his right along the river Aa, which, he reasonably
thought, gave him a full security from that quarter. But the English
ships, which were accidentally on the coast, being drawn by the noise of
the firing, sailed up the river, and flanking the French, 
<PB N="400" REF="404"/> did such execution by their artillery, that they put
them to flight; and the Spaniards gained a compleat victory<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Holingshed▪ p. 1150.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>MEANWHILE the principal army of France, under the duke of
Guise, and that of Spain, under the duke of Savoy, approached very near each
other on the frontiers of Picardy; and as the two Kings had come into their
respective camps, attended by the flower of their nobility, men expected that
some great and important event would follow, from the emulation of these
warlike nations. But Philip, tho' actuated by the ambition, possessed
not the enterprize, of a con∣queror; and he was willing, notwithstanding the
superiority of his numbers, and the two great victories which he had gained
at St. Quintin and Gravelines, to put a period to the war by a treaty.
Negociations were entered into for that purpose; and as the terms offered by
the two monarchs were somewhat wide of each other, the armies were put into
winter quarters, till the princes could come to better agreement. Among other
conditions, Henry demanded the restitution of Navarre to its lawful owner;
Philip that of Calais and its territory to England: But in the midst of
these negociations and debates, news arrived of the death of Queen Mary; and
Philip, no longer connected with England, began to relax in his instances on
that capital article. This was the only circumstance which could have made
the death of that princess a loss to the kingdom.</P>
<P>MARY had been long in a very declining state of health; and
having mistaken her dropsy for a pregnancy, she had made use of an
improper regimen, and her malady daily augmented. Every reflection now
tormented her: The conscious∣ness of being hated by her subjects, the
prospect of Elizabeth's succession, apprehensions of the danger to
which the catholic religion stood exposed, dejection for the loss of
Calais<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">The loss of Calais so much affected
her, that she said to her attendant<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, that when she was dead, they would find Calais at her
heart.</NOTE>, concern for the ill state of her affairs, and, above all,
anxiety for the absence of her husband, who, she knew, intended soon to
depart for Spain, and to settle there during the rest of his life: All
these melancholy circumstances preyed upon her mind, and threw her into a
lingering fever, of<NOTE PLACE="marg">Death of the Queen.</NOTE>which she
died, after a short and unfortunate reign of five years, four months,<NOTE PLACE="marg">17 November.</NOTE>and eleven days.</P>
<P>IT is not necessary to employ many words in drawing the
character of this prin∣cess. She possessed few qualities, either
estimable or amiable; and her person was as little engaging as her
behaviour and address. Obstinacy, bigotry, vio∣lence, cruelty, malignity,
revenge, tyranny; every circumstance of her cha∣racter took a tincture from
her bad temper and narrow understanding. And <PB N="401" REF="405"/> amidst
that complication of vices, which entered into her composition, we shall
scarce find any virtue but sincerity; a quality, which she seems to
have main∣tained throughout her whole life; except in the beginning of her
reign, when the necessity of her affairs obliged her to make some
promises to the protestants, which she certainly never intended to
perform. But in these cases a weak bi∣gotted woman, under the government of
priests, easily finds casuistry sufficient to justify to herself
the violation of an engagement. She appears also, as well as her father, to
have been susceptible of some attachments of friendship; and that
without the caprice and inconstancy which were so remarkable in the conduct
of that monarch. To which we may add, that, in many circumstances of her
life, she gave indications of resolution and vigour of mind; a quality,
which seems to have been inherent in her family.</P>
<P>CARDINAL Pole had been long in a declining state of health
from an intermit∣ing fever; and he died the same day with the Queen, about
sixteen hours after her. The benign character of this prelate, the modesty
and humanity of his deport∣ment, made him be universally beloved; insomuch
that in a nation, where the most furious persecution was carried on, and
the most violent religious factions pre∣vailed, entire justice, even by
most of the reformers, has been done to his merit. The haughty pontiff, Paul
the fourth, had entertained some prejudices against him; and when England
declared war against Henry, the ally of that pope, he seized the
opportunity of revenge, and revoking Pole's legantine commission, appointed
in his room cardinal Peyto, an observantine friar and confessor to the
Queen. But Mary would never permit the new legate to exercise his power; and
Paul was afterwards obliged to restore cardinal Pole to his authority.</P>
<P>THERE occur few general remarks, besides what have been taken
notice of in the course of our narration, with regard to the general state
of the kingdom during this reign. The naval power of England was then so
inconsiderable, that fourteen thousand pounds being ordered to be applied
to the fleet by the treasurer and admiral, both for repairing and victualling
it, they computed, that, when that money was expended, ten thousand pounds a
year would afterwards answer a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
necessary charges<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. III. p.
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>9.</NOTE>. The arbitrary
proceedings of the Queen, abovementioned, j<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>in∣ed to many monopolies granted by this princess, as well as by
her father, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> very much the
growth of trade; and so much the more, that all other princes in Europe
either were not permitted or did not find it necessary to act in so
tyran∣ni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>al a manner. Acts of
Parliament, both in the last reign and in the beginning of the present, had
laid the same impositions on the merchants of the s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ll yard as on other aliens: Yet the Queen, immediately
after her marriage, comp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ied with
the <PB N="402" REF="406"/> sollicitations of the emperor, and, by her
prerogative, suspended these acts of Parliament<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. XV. p. 364.</NOTE>. No body in that age pretended to
question this exercise of the prerogative. The historians are entirely
silent with regard to it; and it is only by the collection of public papers
that it is handed down to us.</P>
<P>AN absurd law had been made in the preceding reign, by which
every one was prohibited from making cloth unless he had served an
apprenticeship for seven years. This law was repealed in the first year
of the Queen's reign; and this plain reason given, that it had occasioned
the decay of the woolen manufac∣tory, and had ruined several towns<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">1 Mar. Parl. 2. cap. 7.</NOTE>. It is strange that
Edward's law should have been revived during the reign of Elizabeth; and
still more strange, that it should still subsist.</P>
<P>A PASSAGE to Archangel, by the north of Nova Zembla, had been
discovered by the English during the last reign; and a beneficial trade
with Muscovy had been established. A solemn embassy was sent by
the Czar to Queen Mary. The ambassadors were shipwrecked on the coast
of Scotland; but being hospitably en∣tertained there, they proceeded on their
journey, and were received at London with great pomp and solemnity<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hollingshed, p. 732. Heylin, p. 71.</NOTE>. This seems to have
been the first intercourse, which that empire had with any of the western
potentates of Europe.</P>
<P>A LAW was passed in this reign<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">4 &amp; 5 Phil. &amp; Mar. cap. 2.</NOTE>, by which the number of
horses, arms, and furniture, was established, which each person,
according to the extent of his property, should be provided of for the
defence of the kingdom. A man of a thousand pounds a year, for instance,
was obliged to maintain at his own charges six horses fit for demi-lances,
of which three at least to be furnished with suf∣ficient harnesses,
steel saddles, and weapons proper for the demi-lances; and ten light
horses fit for light horsemen, with furniture and weapons requisite for
them: He was also obliged to have forty corslets furnished; fifty almain
rivets, or instead of them, forty coats of plate, corslets or brigandines
furnished; forty pikes, thirty long bows, thirty sheafs of arrows, thirty
steel caps or skulls, twenty black bills or halberts, twenty haquebuts, and
twenty morions or sallets. We may remark, that a man of a thousand merks of
stock was rated equal to one of two hundred pounds a year: A proof that few
or none at that time lived on their stock in money, and that great profits
were made by the merchants in the course of their trade. There is no class
above a thousand pounds a year.</P>
