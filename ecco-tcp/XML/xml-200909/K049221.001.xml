<HEAD>TO HIS GRACE THE Duke of BUCCLEUGH.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is with much pleasure I embrace this opportunity of testifying my sincere respect for YOUR GRACE's exalted character, as the friend and as the ornament of your coun∣try, by addressing these volumes to a name so much revered and beloved by the nation
<PB N="viii" REF="5"/>whose poetry they are intended to preserve and to illustrate.</P>
<P>The chief compositions in this volume, MY LORD, will be found to breathe the living spirit of the Scotish people, a race of men who have left monuments of their martial glory in every country. YOUR GRACE, it is hoped, will with pleasure here recognise the noble ardour your example lately tended to revive, by raising and commanding in person a military force in defence of your country, at a period when her natives had not discernment to perceive, nor spirit to assume, the privileges of British subjects.</P>
<P>The second volume, MY LORD, contains chiefly pieces descriptive of rural merriment, and of love and domestic happiness. Even these, it is humbly believed, YOUR GRACE will not disdain; for it is well known that the felicity of the poor in general, and of your numerous tenants and dependants in
<PB N="ix" REF="6"/>particular, is regarded by YOUR GRACE as essential to your own. In reward, YOUR GRACE enjoys a domestic felicity now sel∣dom or never known to the great who are generally obliged to exchange the free en∣joyment of true pleasure for the gaudy sla∣very of ostentation.</P>
<P>At a period when many of the British nobility are wasting their patrimonial estates in profligate dissipation; men trained to arms in defence of their rights and liberties, vil∣lages beautified and rendered salubrious, and their inhabitants rendered happy, have been the monuments of expence of the DUKE OF BUCCLEUGH.</P>
<P>The silent gratitude of the poor will ever speak YOUR GRACE's praises with an ex∣pression unknown to the most exalted elocu∣tion; and it were surely absurd for any wri∣ter to enlarge on what is the common subject
<PB N="x" REF="7"/>of conversation, and known to all; I shall not therefore any longer intrude on YOUR GRACE's patience.</P>
<P>That SCOTLAND may long consider YOUR GRACE as one of the best guardians of her liberty, and the living assertor of her an∣cient spirit, is the earnest wish of,</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>MY LORD, YOUR GRACE's Most obedient Servant, JOHN PINKERTON.</SIGNED></CLOSER>

<HEAD>DISSERTATION I. ON THE ORAL TRADITION OF POETRY.</HEAD>
<P>IT has long been a subject of regret, that the inven∣tors of the fine Arts have by oblivion been deprived of the reputation due to their memory. Of the many realms which lay claim to their birth, Egypt seems to possess the preference. Yet, like the Nile, which ani∣mates that country, while they have diffused pleasure and utility over kingdoms, their origin remains hid in the most profound obscurity.</P>
<P>That poetry holds a distinguished superiority over all these sciences is allowed; yet the first practiser of this enchanting art has lost the renown it was designed to confer. We must either allow the contested claim of the Osiris of the Egyptians, and Apollo of the Greeks, or be content to withhold from any, the fame which indeed seems due to as many inventors as there are dis∣tinct nations in the world. For poetry appears not to
<PB N="xvi" REF="12"/>require the labour of disquisition, or aid of chance, to invent; but is rather the original language of men in an infant state of society in all countries. It is the effusion of fancy actuated by the passions: and that these are always strongest when uncontrouled by custom, and the manners which in an advanced community are termed polite, is evident. But the peculiar advantages, which a certain situation of extrinsic objects confers on this art, have already been so well illustrated by emi∣nent critics
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Particularly Dr. Blackwell, in his Enquiry into the Life and Writings of Homer; and Dr. Blair, in his elegant Dissertation on the Poems of Ossian.</NOTE>, that it is unnecessary here to remember them. I have besides noted a few such as immediately concern the compositions now under view in the sub∣sequent Dissertation; and only propose here to give a brief account of the utility of the Oral Tradition of Poetry, in that barbarous state of society which neces∣sarily precedes the invention of letters; and of the cir∣cumstances that conspired to render it easy and safe.</P>
<P>Among the Egyptians, probably the most ancient authors of the elegant, as well as useful sciences, we find that verses were originally used solely to preserve the laws of their princes, and sayings of their wise men from oblivion
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Herodot. Diodor. Sicul. &amp;c.</NOTE>. These were sometimes inscribed in their temples in their hieroglyphic character, but more
<PB N="xvii" REF="13"/>frequently only committed to the memory of the ex∣pounders of their Law, or disciples of their sages. Pythagoras, who was initiated in their secret science, conveyed in like manner his dictates to his disciples, as appears from the moral verses which pass under his name at this day. And though the authenticity of these may be questioned, yet that he followed this mode of bequeathing his knowledge to his followers, is proved from the consent of all antiquity
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Jamblichus de vita Pythag. <HI>passim;</HI> and particularly <HI>lib.</HI> I. <HI>cap.</HI> 15. and 25.</NOTE>. Nay, before him, Thales composed in like manner his System of Natural Philosophy. And even so late as the time of Aristotle, the Laws of the Agathyrsi, a nation in Sarmatia, were all delivered in verse. Not to mention the known laws of the Twelve Tables, which, from the fragments still remaining of them, appear to have consisted of short rythmic sentences.</P>
<P>From laws and religion poetry made an easy progress to the celebration of the Gods and Heroes, who were their founders. Verses in their praise were sung on solemn occasions by the composers, or bards themselves. We meet with many before Homer, who distinguished themselves by such productions. Fabricius
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">In Bibliotheca Graeca, <HI>tom.</HI> I.</NOTE> has enu∣merated near seventy whose names have reached our times. That immortal author had the advantage of
<PB N="xviii" REF="14"/>hearing their poems repeated; and was certainly in∣debted to his predecessors for many beauties which we admire as original. That he was himself an ΑΟΙΔΟΣ, or Minstrel, and sung his own verses to the lyre, is shown by the admirable author of the Enquiry into his Life and Writings
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sect. VIII.</NOTE>. Nor were his poems rescued from the uncertain fame of tradition, and committed to wri∣ting till some time after his death
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Aelian. Var. Hist. lib. xiii. c. 14.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Such was the utility of the poetic tradition among the more polished nations of antiquity: and with those they denominated Barbarians we find it no less practised
<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">The reader, who would desire more intelligence on this head, may consult a curious <HI>Dissertation on the Monuments which supplied the Defect of Writing among the first Historians,</HI> by the Abbé Ansesm, in Les Memoires de l'Academie des Inscriptions, &amp;c.</NOTE>. The Persians had their Magi, who preserved, as would seem in this way, the remarkable events of former times, and in war went before the army singing the praises of their illustrious men, whom the extraordinary gratitude and admiration of their countrymen had exalted into Deities. If they gained the victory, the Song of Triumph recorded the deeds of those who had fallen, and by their praises animated the ambition of those who enjoyed the conquest to farther acts of valour. The latter custom
<PB N="xix" REF="15"/>was in use still more anciently among the Jews, as appears from the songs of Moses
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Exod XV.</NOTE> and Deborah
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Judges V.</NOTE> preserved in Sacred Writ.</P>
<P>The Druids of Gaul and Britain afford a noted in∣stance
<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Et Bardi quidem fortia virorum illustrium facta heroicis com∣posita versibus, cum dulcibus lyrae modulis cantitarunt. <HI>Ammian. Marcell.</HI> lib. xvi.</NOTE>. Such firm hold did their traditions take of the memory, that some of them are retained in the minds of their countrymen to this very day

<PB N="xx" REF="16"/>Germans, as we learn from Tacitus, had no other mode of commemorating the transactions of past times than by verse. The brave actions of their ancestors were always sung as an incentive to their imitation before they entered into combat. The like we read of the ancient Goths

<P>A curious specimen of the Eastern religious poetry may be seen in Sir John Chardin's Voyage to Persia, vol. I.</P></NOTE>. From them it would appear that rime, that great help to the remembrance of tra∣ditional poetry, passed to the Troubadours of Provence; who from them seem also to have received the spirit and character of their effusions. Like them, they composed amorous verses with delicacy and nature; but when they attempted the sublimer walk of the Heroic Song, their imagination was often bewildered, and they wandered into the contiguous regions of the incredible and absurd

<P>In proportion as Literature advanced in the world, Oral Tradition disappeared. The venerable British Bards were in time succeeded by the Welsh Beirdh
<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">History of Wales, by Caradoc of Lhancarvan, &amp;c. 1702. p. 159</NOTE>,
<PB N="xxii" REF="18"/>whose principal occupation seems to have been to pre∣serve the genealogy of their patrons, or at times to amuse them with some fabulous story of their predeces∣sors sung to the harp or crowd
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>This is the instrument meant in the following verses of Ven. Fortunatus, lib. vii.
<Q><L>Romanusque lyra plaudat tibi, barbarus harpa,</L>
<L>Graecus Achilliaca, Crotta Britanna canat.</L></Q></P>
<P>See more of the Harp in War. Antiq. Hibern. cap. 22. And Mr. Evans, Dissert. de Bardis, p. 80.</P></NOTE>, an instrument which Griffith ap Conan, King of Wales, is said to have brought from Ireland, about the beginning of the twelfth century.</P>
<P>In like manner, among the Caledonians, as an inge∣nious writer
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Mr. Macpherson, in his Dissertation on the Era of Ossian, p. 228. ed. 1773.</NOTE> acquaints us, <Q>Every chief in process of time had a bard in his family, and the office be∣came hereditary. By the succession of these bards the poems concerning the ancestors of the family were handed down from generation to generation; they were repeated to the whole clan on solemn occa∣sions, and always alluded to in the new composi∣tions of the bards.</Q> The successors of Ossian were at length employed chiefly in the mean office of preserving fabulous genealogies, and flattering the pride of their chieftains at the expence of truth, without
<PB N="xxiii" REF="19"/>even fancy sufficient to render their inventions either pleasing or plausible. That order of men, I believe, is now altogether extinct; yet they have left a spirit of poetry in the country where they flourished
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Martin's, and other Descriptions of the Western Isles, passim.</NOTE>; and Ossian's harp still yields a dying sound among the wilds of Morven.</P>
<P>Having thus given a faint view of the progress of the Oral Tradition of Poetry to these times
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">For an account of the more modern minstrels see Dr. Percy's Dissertation, which is so complete that it leaves nothing to add:</NOTE>, I proceed to shew what arts the ancient bards employed to make their verses take such hold of the memory of their countrymen, as to be transmitted safe and entire without the aid of writing for many ages. These may be considered as affecting the passions and the ear. Their mode of expression was simple and genuine. They of consequence touched the passions truly and effectively. And when the passions are engaged, we listen with avidity to the tale that so agreeably affects them; and remember it again with the most prompt facility. This may be observed in children, who will forget no circumstance of an interesting story, more especially if striking or dreadful to the fancy; when they cannot remember a short maxim which only oc∣cupies the judgement. The passions of men have been and will be the same through all ages. Poetry is the sovereign of the passions, and will reign while they
<PB N="xxiv" REF="20"/>exist. We may laugh at Sir Isaac Newton, as we have at Descartes; but we shall always admire a Homer, an Ossian, or a Shakspere.</P>
<P>As the subjects of these genuine painters of nature deeply interested the heart, and by that means were so agreeable and affecting, that every hearer wished to remember them; so their mode of constructing their verse was such, that the remembrance was easy and expeditious. A few of their many arts to aid the me∣mory I shall here enumerate.</P>
<P N="1">I. Most of these Oral poems were set to music, as would appear, by the original authors themselves. That this was the custom so early as the days of Homer, may be seen in the excellent author formerly adduced
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Enquiry, &amp;c. Sect. VIII.</NOTE>. How should we have been affected by hearing a composition of Homer or Ossian <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ung and played by these immortal masters themselves! With the poem the air seems to have passed from one age to another; but as no musical compositions of the Greeks exist, we are quite in the dark as to the nature of these. I suppose that Ossian's poetry is still recited to its ori∣ginal cadence and to appropriated tunes. We find, in an excellent modern writer
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Mr. Warton, in his History of English Poetry.</NOTE>, that this mode of singing poetry to the harp was reckoned an accomplishment so late as among the Saxon Ecclesiastics. The ancient
<PB N="xxv" REF="21"/>music was confessedly infinitely superior to ours in the command of the passions. Nay, the music of the most barbarous countries has had effects that not all the sublime pathos of Corelli, or animated strains of Handel, could produce. Have not the Welsh, Irish, and Scotish tunes, greater influence over the most in∣formed mind at this day than the best Italian concerto? What Modern refined music could have the powers of the <HI>Rance de Vaches</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Rousseau, Dict. de Musique, <HI>sur cette article.</HI> Though the Swiss are a brave nation, yet their dance, which corresponds to the <HI>Rance des Vaches,</HI> is, like their others, rather expressive of an effemi∣nate spirit. <Q>Les dances des Suisses consistent en un continuel trainement de Jambe, ces pas repondoient mal au courage ferme de cette nation. Coquillart en son Blazon des armes, et des dames.</Q>
<Q><L>Les Escossoys font les repliques,</L>
<L>Pragois et Bretons bretonnans,</L>
<L>Les Suisses dancent leurs Moresques,</L>
<L>A touts leurs tabourins sonnants.</L>
<BIBL>Mons. L. D. Notes à Rabelais, Tom. IV. p. 164. 1725.</BIBL></Q></NOTE> of the Swiss, or the melancholy sound of the Indian Bansha
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See Grainger's Proso-poetic Account of the Culture of the Sugar-cane, Book IV.</NOTE>? Is not the war-music of the rudest inhabitants of the wilds of America or Scot∣land more terrible to the ear than that of the best band in the British army? Or, what is still more surprizing, will not the softer passions be more inflamed by a
<PB N="xxvi" REF="22"/>Turkish air than by the most exquisite effort of a polite composer? as we learn from an elegant wri∣ter
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Letters of Lady M. W. Montague, XXXIII.</NOTE>, whom concurring circumstances rendered the best judge that could be imagined of that subject. The harmony therefore of the old traditional songs possessing such influence over the passions, at the same time that it rendered every expression necessary to the ear, must have greatly recommended them to the remembrance.</P>
<P N="2">II. Besides musical cadence, many arts were used in the versification to facilitate the rehearsal. Such were:</P>
<P N="1">1. The frequent returns of the same sentences and descriptions expressed in the very same words. As for instance, the delivery of messages, the description of battles, &amp;c. of which we meet with infinite examples in Homer, and some, if I mistake not, in Ossian. Good ones may be found in Hardyknute, Part I. v. 123, &amp;c. compared with part II. v. 107, &amp;c. and in Child Maurice, v. 31, with v. 67; and innumerable such in the ancient Traditional Poetry of all nations. These served as land marks, in the view of which the memory travelled secure over the intervening spaces. On this head falls likewise to be mentioned what we call The Burden, that is, the unvaried repetition of one or more lines fixing the tone of the poem throughout the whole. That this is very ancient among the barbaric nations, may be gathered from the known Song of Regner
<PB N="xxvii" REF="23"/>Lodbrog, to be found in Olaus Wormius
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Regner Lodbrog, King of Denmark, flourished in the Ninth Century.</NOTE>; every stanza of which begins with one and the same line. So many of our ballads, both ancient and modern, have this aid to the memory, that it is unnecessary to condescend on any in particular.</P>
<P N="2">2. Alliteration was before the invention of rime greatly used, chiefly by the nations of Northern origi∣nal, to assist the remembrance of their traditional poe∣try. Most of the Runic methods of versification con∣sisted in this practice. It was the only one among the Saxon poets, from whom it passed to the English and Scotish
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P>See Hickes, <HI>Ling. Vet. Sept. Thes. c.</HI> 23. From the Saxons he observes, that the author of <HI>Pierce Plowman</HI> drew this practice, c. 21. This poem was written about 1350. There is a remarkable similarity in its style and manner with those very curious pieces of ancient Scotish poetry, styled The Prophecies of Thomas Rymer, Marvellous Merling, Beid, Berlington, Waldhave, Eltraine, Ba∣nister, and Sybilla, printed at Edinburgh in 1615, and reprinted from that edition, 1742, 8vo. It is very surprising that the re∣spectable editor of <HI>Ancient Scottish Poems, from the MS. of George Bannatyne,</HI> 1568. <HI>Edin.</HI> 1770, seems to regard these as not more ancient than the time of Queen Mary. His reasons are only founded on the modern appearance of some particular passages. That they have been modernized and corrupted, I will readily allow; but that they are on the main nearly as ancient as Rymer's time, who died about the beginning of the 14th Century, I believe the learned must confess from intrinsic evidence, in such cases the surest of all. Not to mention that Sir David Lindsay, who wrote in the reign of James V. is an undoubted witness that they must be more ancient than this eminent Antiquary would infer. For in enumerating the methods he took to divert that prince while under his care in his infancy, after condescending on some risible cir∣cumstances, as
<Q><L>Whan thou wast young I bare thee in my arm</L>
<L>Full tenderly till thou began to gang;</L>
<L>And in thy bed oft happed thee full warm,</L>
<L>With lute in hand than sweetly to thee sang,</L>
<L>Sometime in dancing fiercefully I flang,</L>
<L>And sometimes playing fairses on the flure,</L>
<L>And sometimes of mine office taking cure.</L>
<L>And sometimes like a feind transfigurate,</L>
<L>And sometimes like a greesy ghost of gay,</L>
<L>In divers forms oft times disfigurate, &amp;c.</L></Q></P>
<P>He adds,
<Q><L>The Prophesies of <HI>Rymer, Bede,</HI> and <HI>Merlin,</HI></L>
<L>And many other pleasant history</L>
<L>Of the red <HI>Erin,</HI> and <HI>Gyre Carlin,</HI></L>
<L>Comforting thee when that I saw thee sory.</L>
<BIBL><HI>Episile to the King, prefixed to his Dream.</HI></BIBL></Q></P>
<P>They begin thus:
<Q><L>Merling says in his book, who will read right,</L>
<L>Althouch his sayings be uncouth, they shall be true found,</L>
<L>In the seventh chapter read who so will,</L>
<L>One thousand and more after Christ's birth.</L>
<L>Then the Chalnalider of Cornwall is called,</L>
<L>And the wolf out of Wales is vanquished for aye,</L>
<L>Then many ferlies shall fall, and many folk shall die.</L></Q></P>
<P>This exordium is evidently retouched by a modern hand.—But very many of the passages seem to stand in their original form, as the following lines, which are all in the Saxon manner, will testify:
<Q><L>And derfly dung down without any doome—</L>
<L>A proud prince in the preis lordly shall light,</L>
<L>With bold Barons in bushment to battle shall wend.—</L>
<L>There shall a galyart goat with a golden horn.—</L></Q></P>
<P>And many similar. That prophecy which bears the name of Thomas Rymer is not destitute of poetic graces. It opens with the following lines:
<Q><L>Still on my ways as I went</L>
<L>Out throuch a land beside a lee,</L>
<L>I met a bairn upon the bent
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Modernized</HI> way, <HI>though against the rime.</HI></NOTE>,</L>

<PB N="xxviii" REF="24"/>was before thought to constitute the sole difference between prose and verse, was still regarded as an acces∣sary
<PB N="xxix" REF="25"/>grace, and was carried to a ludicrous length by some poets of no mean rank in both nations. So
<PB N="xxx" REF="26"/>late as the reign of Queen Elizabeth we find the fol∣lowing lines in a court poet:
<Q><L>Princes puff'd; barons blustered; lords began lowr,</L>

<P N="3"><PB N="xxxi" REF="27"/>III. But the greatest assistance that could be found to the tradition of poetry was derived from the invention of rime; which is far more ancient than is commonly believed. One of the most learned men this age has produced
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Le Clerc, Biolioth. Universelle, tom. IX.</NOTE>, has shewn that it is common in Scripture. All the Psalms consist of riming verses, and many other passages which he names. They were used among the Greeks so early as the time of Gorgias the Sicilian, who taught the Athenians this practice. And though the spirit of the Greek and Latin languages did not always admit of them in poetry, yet they were used as occasional beauties by their most celebrated writers. Homer, Hesiod, and Virgil, have a few, though ap∣parently more from chance than design. The ancient Saturnine verses were all rimes, as an old commentator
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Servius ad Georg. II. ver. 386.</NOTE> informs us. And it is more than probable they were so constructed merely that the memory might the more easily preserve them, their licence forbidding their being committed to writing. Those who would wish to know more particularly the universality of this mode of versifying among the other ancient nations, may consult the <HI>Huetiana</HI> of the most learned and respect∣able Bishop of Avranches
<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Sect. 78.</NOTE>. The Eastern poetry con∣sists altogether, if I mistake not, of riming lines, as may be observed in the specimens of Hafiz their most
<PB N="xxxii" REF="28"/>illustrious writer, lately published
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Jones, Comment. Poeseos Asiaticae—Richardson's Specimen of Persian Poetry.</NOTE>. It appears, how∣ever, that alliteration supplied the place of rime with the Northern nations till within a recent period
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ol. Worm. Lit. Run. p. 165 &amp; 176.</NOTE>. Ossian's poetry, I suppose, is in stanzas something like our ballad measure; though it were to be wished the translator had favoured us with some information on this head evidenced by specimens of the original. He indeed acquaints us that <Q>Each verse was so con∣nected with those which preceded, or followed it, that if one line had been remembered in a stanza, it was almost impossible to forget the rest
<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Dissert. on the Era of Ossian, p. 228, ed. 1773.</NOTE>:</Q> but this stands greatly in need of explanation.</P>
<P>The common ballad stanza is so simple, that it has been used by most nations as the first mode of con∣structing rimes. The Spanish romanzes bear a great resemblance in this, as in other respects, to the Scotish Ballads. In both, every alternate line ends with similar vowels, though the consonants are not so strictly at∣tended to. As for instance, in the former we have <HI>bana, espada; mala, palabra; vega, cueva; rompan, vol∣canos;</HI> for rimes: and in the later, <HI>m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dale, girdle; keep, bleed; Buleighan, tak him;</HI> &amp;c. The English, even in the ruder pieces of their first minstrels, seem to have
<PB N="xxxiii" REF="29"/>paid more attention to the correspondence of their con∣sonants, as may be observed in the curious Collection published by Dr. Percy.</P>
<P>As the simplicity of this stanza rendered it easy to the composer, and likewise more natural to express the passions, so it added to the facility of recollection. It's tone is sedate and slow. The rimes occur seldom, and at equal distances: though when a more violent passion is to be painted, by doubling the rimes, they at once expressed the mind better, and diversified the harmony. Of this the reader will observe many instances in this collection, as, <HI>Here maun I lie, here maun I die: Like beacon bricht at deid of nicht: Na river heir, my dame, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> deir:</HI> &amp;c. and, to give a very solemn movement to the cadence, they sometimes tripled the rime, an instance of which may be observed in the first stanza of Child Maurice.</P>
<P>When all the circumstances here hinted at are consi∣dered, we shall be less apt to wonder, that, by the concurrence of musical air, retentive arts in the com∣position, and chiefly of rime, the most noble produc∣tions of former periods have been preserved in the me∣mory of a succession of admirers, and have had the good fortune to arrive at our times pure and uncor∣rupted.</P>

<PB N="xxxiv" REF="30"/>
<HEAD>DISSERTATION II. ON THE TRAGIC BALLAD.</HEAD>
<P>THAT species of poetry which we denominate Ballad, is peculiar to a barbarous period. In an advanced state of arts, the Comic Ballad assumes the form of the Song or Sonnet, and the Tragic or Heroic Ballad that of the higher Ode.</P>
<P>The cause of our pleasure in seeing a mournful event represented, or hearing it described, has been attempted to be explained by many critics
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Aristotle, Scaliger, Dubos, Trapp in his Praelections, Hume, Essay on Tragedy; but, above all, Mr. Burke in his Enquiry into the Sublime and Beautiful.</NOTE>. It seems to arise from the mingled passions of Admiration of the art of the author, Curiosity to attend the termination, De∣light arising from a reflection on our own security, and the Sympathetic Spirit.</P>
<P><PB N="xxxv" REF="31"/>In giving this pleasure, perhaps the Tragic Ballad yields to no effort of human genius. When we peruse a polished Tragedy or Ode, we admire the art of the author, and are led to praise the invention; but when we read an unartful description of a melancholy event, our passions are more intensely moved. The laboured productions of the informed composer resemble a Greek or Roman temple; when we enter it, we admire the art of the builder. The rude effusions of the Gothic Muse are like the monuments of their Architecture. We are filled with a religious reverence, and, forgetting our praise of the contriver, adore the present deity.</P>
<P>I believe no Tragic Ballad of renowned Antiquity has reached our times, if we deny the beautiful and pathetic CARMEN DE ATY in Catullus a title to this class; which, as a modern critic of note has observed
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Essay on the writings and genius of Pope, <HI>p.</HI> 324. 3d <HI>ed.</HI></NOTE>, seems a translation from some Greek <HI>Dithyrambic</HI>
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The <HI>Dithyrambics</HI> were Heroic Songs, written with the highest glow of poetic fancy in honour of the ancient deities. Aristotle informs us, that the Greek Tragedy originated from them; as their Comedy did from their Pastoral Love Songs.</NOTE>, far more ancient than the times of that poet. His translation of Sappho's Ode might shew that he took a delight in the ancient Greek compositions, from which indeed he seems to have derived in a great measure his peculiarly delicate vein.</P>
<P><PB N="xxxvi" REF="32"/>But it was with the nations in a state of barbarity that this effusion of the heart flourished as in it's pro∣per soil; their societies, rude and irregular, were full of vicissitudes, and every hour subject to the most dreadful accidents. The Ministrels, who only knew, and were inspired by the present manners, caught the tale of mortality, and recorded it for the instruction and en∣tertainment of others. It pleased by moving the pas∣sions, and, at the same time, afforded caution to their auditors to guard against similar mis-adventures.</P>
<P>It is amusing to observe how expressive the poetry of every country is of its real manners. That of the Northern nations is ferocious to the highest degree. Nor need we wonder that those, whose laws obliged them to decide the most trifling debate with the sword
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Frotho etiam III. Danorum rex, quemadmodum Saxo, lib. V. refert, de qualibet controversia ferre decerni sanxit: speciosius vi∣ribus quam verbis, confligendum existimans. <HI>Schedius de diis Ger. Syng.</HI> II. <HI>c.</HI> 46.</NOTE>, delighted in a vein of poetry, which only painted deeds of blood, and objects horrible to the imagination. The ballad poetry of the Spaniards is tinged with the romantic gallantry of the nation. The hero is all complaisance; and takes off his helmet in the heat of combat, when he thinks on his mistress. That of the English is generous and brave. In their most noble ballad, Percy laments over the death of his
<PB N="xxxvii" REF="33"/>mortal foe. That of the Scots is perhaps, like the face of their country, more various than the rest. We find in it the bravery of the English, the gallantry of the Spanish, and I am afraid in some instances the ferocity of the Northern.</P>
<P>A late writer
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Miscellanies by John Armstrong, M.D. vol. II. p. 254.</NOTE> has remarked, that, <Q>the Scottish tunes, whether melancholy or gay, whether amorous, martial, or pastoral, are in a style highly original, and most feelingly expressive of all the passions from the sweetest to the most terrible.</Q> He proceeds, <Q>Who was it that threw out those dreadful wild ex∣pressions of distraction and melancholy in <HI>Lady Cul∣ross's Dream?</HI> an old composition, now I am afraid lost, perhaps because it was almost too terrible for the ear.</Q></P>
<P>This composition is neither lost, nor is it too terri∣ble for the ear. On the contrary, a child might hear it repeated in a winter night without the smallest emo∣tion. A copy
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P>It is intituled, <Q>A Godly Dream compiled by Elizabeth Melvil, Lady Culross younger, at the request of a friend.</Q> Edinburgh, 1737, 12mo. p. 20. It is either reprinted from some former edition, or from a MS. It was written, I conjecture, about the end of the Sixteenth Century; but in this edition I suspect seve∣ral expressions are modernized and altered to accommodate it to the common capacity.</P>
<P>The lady Culross here meant was Elizabeth daughter of Sir James Melvil of Halhill, and wife of John Colvil Commendator of Culross. She is believed to have been the mother of Samuel Colvil the satyrical poet, author of the Scots Hudibras, &amp;c.</P></NOTE> of it now lies before me, and as some
<PB N="xxxviii" REF="34"/>curiosity may have been raised by the above remark, I shall here give an account of it. The dreadful and melancholy of this production are solely of the religious kind, and may have been deeply affecting to the enthu∣siastic at the period in which it was written: It begins thus;
<Q><LG>
<L>Upon a day as I did mourn full sore,</L>
<L>For sundry things wherewith my soul was grieved,</L>
<L>My grief increased, and grew more and more,</L>
<L>I comfort fled, and could not be relieved;</L>
<L>With heaviness my heart was sore mischieved,</L>
<L>I loathed my life, I could not eat nor drink,</L>
<L>I might not speak, nor look to none that lived,</L>
<L>But mused alone, and diverse things did think.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>This wretched world did so molest my mind,</L>
<L>I thought upon this false and iron age,</L>
<L>And how our hearts are so to vice inclined,</L>
<L>That Satan seems most fearfully to rage,</L>
<L>Nothing on earth my sorrow could aswage,</L>
<L>I felt my sin so strongly to increase;</L>
<L>I grieved the spirit was wont to be my pledge;</L>
<L>My soul was plunged into most deep distress.</L>
</LG></Q></P>
<P><PB N="xxxix" REF="35"/>Her Saviour is then supposed to appear in a dream, and lead her through many hair-breadth scapes into Heaven:
<Q><L>Through dreadful dens, which made my heart aghast,</L>
<L>He bare me up when I began to tire;</L>
<L>Sometimes we clamb oer cragie mountains high;</L>
<L>And sometimes stayed on ugly braes of sand,</L>
<L>They were so stay that wonder was to see;</L>
<L>But when I feared, he held me by the hand.—</L>
<L>Through great deserts we wandered on our way.—</L>
<L>Forward we past on narrow bridge of tree,</L>
<L>Oer waters great which hideously did roar, &amp;.</L></Q></P>
<P>The most terrible passage to a superstitious ear, is that in which she supposes herself suspended over the Gulph of Perdition:
<Q><L>Ere I was ware, one gripped me at last,</L>
<L>And held me high above a flaming fire.</L>
<L>The fire was great, the heat did pierce me sore,</L>
<L>My faith grew weak, my grip was very small.</L>
<L>I trembled fast, my fear grew more and more.</L>
<L>My hands did shake that I held him withall,</L>
<L>At length they loosed, then I began to fall, &amp;c.</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="xl" REF="36"/>At length she arrives in view of the Heavenly man∣sions in a stanza, which, to alter a little her own ex∣pression, 'Glisters with <HI>tinsel.</HI>'</P>
<Q><L>I looked up unto that castle fair</L>
<L>Glistering with gold; and shining silver bright</L>
<L>The stately towers did mount above the air;</L>
<L>They blinded me they cast so great a light,</L>
<L>My heart was glad to see that joyful sight,</L>
<L>My voyage then I thought it not in vain,</L>
<L>I him besought to guide me there aright,</L>
<L>With many vows never to tire again.</L></Q>
<P>And the whole concludes with an exhortation to a pious life.</P>
<P>But what has the Christian religion to do with poetry? In the true poetic terrible, I believe, some passages in Hardyknute yield to no attempt of a strong and dark fancy. The Ballad styled Edward may, I fear, be ra∣ther adduced as an evidence that this displeases, when it rises to a degree of the horrible, which that singular piece certainly partakes of.</P>
<P>The Pathetic is the other principal walk of the Tragic Muse: and in this the Scotish Ballads yield to no compositions whatever. What can be imagined more moving than the catastrophes of Ossian's Dar∣thula, the most pathetic of all poems? or of Hardyk∣nute,
<PB N="xli" REF="37"/>Child Maurice, and indeed most of the pieces now collected? Were ever the feelings of a fond mother expressed in a language equal in simplicity and pathos to that of lady Bothwell?—This leads me to remark, that the dialect in which the Scotish Ballads are written gives them a great advantage in point of touching the passions. Their language is rough and unpolished, and seems to flow immediately from the heart
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE>. We meet with no concettos or far-fetched thoughts in them. They possess the pathetic power in the highest degree, because they do not affect it; and are striking, because they do not meditate to strike.</P>
<P>Most of the compositions now offered to the public, have already received approbation. The mutilated Fragment of Hardyknute formerly in print, was ad∣mired and celebrated by the best critics. As it is now, I am inclined to think, given in it's original perfection, it is certainly the most noble production in this style that ever appeared in the world. The manners and characters are strongly marked, and well preserved; the incidents deeply interesting; and the catastrophe new and affecting. I am indebted for most of the stanzas, now recovered, to the memory of a lady in Lanarkshire.</P>
<P><PB N="xlii" REF="38"/>A modern lyric poet of the first class
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Gray. See his Letters published by Mr. Mason. Sect. IV. Let. XXV.</NOTE> has pro∣nounced Child Maurice a Divine Ballad. <Q>Aristotle's best rules,</Q> says he, <Q>are observed in it in a man∣ner that shews the author had never read Aristotle.</Q> Indeed if any one will peruse Aristotle's Art of Poetry with Dacier's Elucidations, and afterwards compare their most approved rules with this simple Ballad, he will find that they are better illustrated by this rude effort of the Gothic Muse, than by the most exquisite Tragedy of ancient or modern times. The Oedipus Tyrannus of Sophocles, the Athalie of Racine, the Merope of Maffei, and even the very excellent Drama, which seems immediately founded on it, not excepted; there being many delicate strokes in this original, which the plot adopted by that author forbade his making proper use of. This does honour at once to the un∣known composer of this Ballad, and to the first of cri∣tics. In the former the reader will admire a genius, that, probably untracked by erudition, could produce a story corresponding to the intricate though natural rules of the Greek author. To the latter will be readily confirmed the applause of an ancient
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Apud Suidam.</NOTE>, that, he was the secretary of Nature, and his pen was ever dipped in good sense.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">* These Dissertations, &amp;c. were written of this date, but slight additions have been made to them from time to time; as the reader will observe from references to books published since that period.</NOTE>.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="editor's note">
<PB N="xlv" REF="40"/>
<P>HAVING in the First of the foregoing Dissertations mentioned with applause the Spanish Ballads, or Romanzes, contained in the HISTORIA DE LAS GUERRAS CIVILES DE GRANADA, and that book being seldom to be met with, and written in a language of no wide study, the Editor has been induced to give a few translations from that work; the two which Dr. Percy has published having rather excited than gra∣tified curiosity.</P>
<P>Before producing these translations, it may be pro∣per to give some short account of the work whence they are taken. The History of the Civil Wars of Granada is a well-written narration of those dissentions which tore that kingdom in pieces, for some years be∣fore the period that Ferdinand and Isabella, king and queen of Christian Spain, conquered it, down to the time of conquest. The chief sources of those dissen∣tions were the two great <HI>Vandos,</HI> or factions, of the Zegris and the Abencerrages; whose exploits and ad∣ventures, with those of their adherents, are here dis∣played with a minute detail that savours very strongly of romance, though the great outlines of the work are evidently founded on historical truth; which, if the
<PB N="xlvi" REF="41"/>reader pleases, is indeed only another name for a cer∣tain species of romance.</P>
<P>This History, as we learn from the work itself to∣wards the close, is a translation from the Arabic of an anonymous Moor, who fled to Africa with many of his countrymen, when Granada was yielded to the arms of Ferdinand. His grandson, by name Argutaafa, found this work among his grandfather's papers, and presented it to a Jew, called Rabbi Santo, who translated it into He∣brew; and gave the Arabic Original to Don Rodrigo Ponce de Leon, Conde de Baylen. That lord being interested by it, as his ancestors had been concerned in the wars there related, ordered the Jew to translate it into Castillan Spanish; and afterwards gave the translation to the Spanish editor, whose name from the first edition, Barcelona printed by Seb. Matevad, 1610, appears to be Ginez Perez.</P>
<P>On almost every occasion the author produces some romanze, as the voucher of his incidents, translations of a few of which shall now be produced. It must, however, be premised, that the first translation is merely meant to convey to the reader an idea of the verse in which most of the originals are written; for which purpose one of the feeblest was chosen, as, had strength of thought or incident been attempted in this way, the spirit would have totally evaporated in the midst of attention to the double rimes, of which the English language is remarkably penurious.</P>

<P>From TRADITION.</P>
<P><HI>To preserve the tone as well as the sense of this Ballad, the burden should be repeated through the whole, though it is here omitted for the sake of concisemess.</HI></P>
<L>THERE were twa sisters liv'd in a bouir;</L>
<L>Binnorie, O Binnorie!</L>
<L>Their father was a baron of pouir,</L>
<L>By the bonnie mildams of Binnorie.</L>
<L N="5">The youngest was meek, and fair as the May,</L>
<L>Whan she springs in the east wi the gowden day:</L>
<L>The eldest austern as the winter cauld,</L>
<L>Ferce was her saul, and her seiming was bauld.</L>
<L>A gallant squire cam sweet Isabel to wooe;</L>
<L N="10">Her sister had naething to luve I trow;</L>
<L>But filld was she wi dolour and ire,</L>
<L>To see that to her the comlie squire</L>
<L>Preferd the debonair Isabel:</L>
<L>Their hevin of luve of spyte was her hell.</L>
<L N="15">Till ae ein she to her sister can say</L>
<L>"Sweit sister cum let us wauk and play."</L>
<L>They wauked up, and they wauked down,</L>
<L>Sweit sang the birdis in the vallie loun!</L>
<L><PB N="203" REF="166"/>Whan they cam to the roaring lin,</L>
<L N="20">She drave unweiting Isabel in.</L>
<L>'O sister! sister! tak my hand,</L>

<L>'O sister! sister! tak my middle,</L>
<L>'And ye fall hae my gowden girdle.'</L>
<L N="25">Sumtimes she sank, sumtimes she swam,</L>
<L>Till she cam to the miller's dam:</L>
<L>The miller's dochter was out that ein</L>
<L>And saw her rowing down the streim.</L>
<L>"O father deir! in your mill dam</L>
<L N="30">"There is either a lady or a milk white swan!"</L>
<L>Twa days were gane whan to her deir</L>
<L>Her wraith at deid of nicht cold apeir:</L>
<L>'My luve, my deir, how can ye sleip,</L>

<L N="35">'My deir, how can ye sleip bot pain,</L>
<L>'Whan she by her cruel sister is slain?'</L>
<L>Up raise he sune in frichtfu mude,</L>
<L>'Busk ye my meiny and seik the flude.'</L>
<L>They socht her up and they socht her doun,</L>

<HEAD>HARDYKNUTE.</HEAD>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>PART I.</HEAD>
<P>HARDYKNUTE.] This name is of <HI>Danish</HI> extract, and signifies <HI>Canute the strong. Hardy</HI> in the original implies <HI>strong,</HI> not <HI>valiant;</HI> and though used in the latter sense by the English, yet the Scots still take it in its first acceptation. <Q>The names in Cunningham,</Q> says Sir David Dalrymple, <Q>are all Saxon, as is the name of the country itself.</Q> An∣nals of Scotland, <HI>an.</HI> 1160, <HI>note.</HI> The <HI>Danish</HI> and <HI>Saxon</HI> are both derived from the old <HI>Gothic,</HI> and were so similar, that a person of the one nation might understand one of the other speaking in his proper tongue. From the names and whole tenor of
<PB N="116" REF="179"/>this poem, I am inclined to think the chief scene is laid in Cunninghamshire; where likewise the <HI>battle of Largs,</HI> supposed to be that so nobly described in the first part, was fought.</P>
<P>Ver. 5. <HI>Britons.</HI>] This was the common name which the Scots gave the English anciently, as may be observed in their old poets; and particularly <HI>Blind Harry,</HI> whose testimony indeed can only be relied on, as to the common language and manners of his time; his Life of Wallace being a tissue of the most absurd fa∣bles ever mingled.</P>
<P>V. 9. <HI>Hie on a bill,</HI> &amp;c.] This necessary caution in those times, when strength was the only protection from violence, is well painted by a contemporary French bard:
<Q><L>Un chasteau scay sur roche espouvantable,</L>
<L>En lieu venteux, la rive perilleuse,</L>
<L>La vy tyrant seant à haute table,</L>
<L>En grand palais, en sal plantureuse, &amp;c.</L>
<BIBL><HI>D' Alliac, Eveque de Cambray.</HI></BIBL></Q></P>
<P>V. 12. <HI>Knicht.</HI>] These knights were only military officers attending the earls, barons, &amp;c. as appears from the histories of the middle ages. See Selden, <HI>Tit. Hon. P.</HI> II. <HI>c.</HI> 5. The name is of Saxon origin, and of remote antiquity, as is proved by the following fragment of a poem on the Spanish expedition of Charles the Great, written at that period:
<PB N="117" REF="180"/>
<Q><L><HI>Sie zeslugen ros unde man</HI></L>

<BIBL><HI>MS. de Bello Car. M. Hisp. apud Keysler diss. de Cultu Solis, Freji, &amp; Othini;</HI> Halae, 1728.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>The oath which the ancient knights of Scotland gave at their investiture is preserved in a letter of Drummond of Hawthornden to Ben Jonson, and is as follows:</P>
<Q><P><HI>I shall fortifie and defend the true holy Catholique and Christian Religion, presently professed, at all my power.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I shall be loyal and true to my Sovereign Lord the King his Majesty; and do honour and reverence to all orders of che∣valrie, and to the uoble office of arms.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I shall fortifie and defend justice to the uttermost of my power, but feid or favour.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I shall never flie from the King's Majesty my Lord and Master, or his lieutenant, in time of battel or medly with dishonour.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="181"/><HI>I shall defend my native country from all aliens and strangers at all my power.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I shall maintain and defend the honest adoes and quarrels of all ladies of honour, widows, orphans, and maids of good fame.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I shall do diligence, wherever I hear tell there are any traitors, murtherers, rievers, and masterful theeves and out∣laws, that suppress the poor, to bring them to the law at all my power.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I shall maintain aed defend the noble and gallant state of chevalrie with horses, harneses, and other knichtly apparel to my power.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I shall be diligent to enquire, and seek to have the know∣ledge of all points and articles, touching or concerning my duty, contained in the book of chevalry.</HI></P>
<P><HI>All and sundry the premises I oblige me to keep and fulfill. So help me God by my own hand, and by God himself.</HI></P></Q>
<P>A curious account of the rise and progress of knight∣hood, and its influence on society, may be found in a learned and ingenious work lately published by Dr. Stuart, intitled, <HI>A view of Society in Europe, or Enquiries concerning the History of Law, Government, and Manners.</HI></P>
<P>V. 16. <HI>Emergard.</HI>] In the common copies it is Elenor, and indeed in all the recitals I have heard; but in a late edition published with other Scotish songs at Edinburgh, 1776, it is rightly read as here. <HI>Emergard,</HI> or <HI>Ermengarde,</HI> was daughter of the Viscount of Beau∣mont,
<PB N="119" REF="182"/>and wife of William the Lyon. She died in 1233 As the name was uncommon, and of difficult pronun∣ciation, the rehearsers seem to have altered it to <HI>Elenor,</HI> which has none of these defects.</P>
<P>The battle of Largs, supposed to be that meant in this poem, was fought on the first of August 1263, so that queen Emergard was dead thirty years before; yet this can amount to no error in chronology, as the verses evidently imply that the lady of Hardyknute <HI>had</HI> no equal in the kingdom for beauty save the queen in the prime of the youth and beauty of both, which might well be forty years, or more, before the period of action in the poem.</P>
<P>V. 25. <HI>Fairly.</HI>] This name seems likewise of Saxon origin. There is a small island and a rivulet in Cun∣ningham still called <HI>Fairly isle</HI> and <HI>Fairly Burn.</HI></P>
<P>V. 43. <HI>Twenty thousand glittering speirs,</HI> &amp;c.] This agrees with Buchanan's account, <HI>Acho—viginti millia militum exposuit.</HI> lib. 7. Torfaeus asserts this number of the Norwegians was left dead on the field; but upon what authority I know not, as the ancient relations of the battle of Largs support not his testimony. See <HI>Johnstone's Translation of Haco's Expedition to Scotland in the year</HI> 1263, <HI>from the Plateyan and Frisian MSS.</HI> printed at Copenhagen 1782.</P>
<P>V. 49. <HI>Page</HI>] The Pages in the periods of chi∣valry were of honourable account. The young war∣riers
<PB N="120" REF="183"/>were first denominated <HI>pages,</HI> then <HI>valets,</HI> or <HI>damei∣seaux,</HI> from which degree they reached that of <HI>ecuyer,</HI> or <HI>squire,</HI> and from this that of <HI>knight.</HI> See <HI>Du Cange,</HI> voc. <HI>Valeti,</HI> &amp; <HI>Domicellus. St. Palaye,</HI> Mem. sur l'anc. Cheval. <HI>P.</HI> I.</P>
<P>V. 61. <HI>He has tane a horn;</HI> &amp;c.] The <HI>horn,</HI> or <HI>bugil,</HI> was anciently used by the Scots instead of the trumpet. They were sometimes richly ornamented, as appears from Lindsay's description of that of Sir Robert Coch∣ran. <Q>The horn he wore was adorned with jewels and precious stones, and tipped with fine gold at both ends. <BIBL><HI>Hist. of Scotland,</HI> J. III.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>V. 88. Westmoreland's <HI>ferce heir.</HI>] <HI>Heir,</HI> in the old Scotish acceptation, seems derived from the Latin <HI>he∣rus,</HI> and signifies not <HI>apparent successor,</HI> but <HI>present lord.</HI> As in the following lines of <HI>Blind Harry:</HI>
<Q><L>Of Southampton he hecht baith heir and lord.</L>
<BIBL>B. 7. c. 1.</BIBL></Q>
<Q><L>Of Glocester the huge lord and heir.</L>
<BIBL>B. 12. c. 1.</BIBL></Q> And in this of <HI>Dunbar,</HI>
<Q>Befoir <HI>Mahoun</HI> the heir of hell.</Q></P>
<P>V. 107—112.] This minute description might lead us to suspect, that a female hand had some part in this composition. But, before our minstrel, Homer has shewn
<PB N="121" REF="184"/>himself an adept in the lady's dress. To the curious remarks on the variation of the British habit, given us by Mr. Walpole, in his <HI>Anecdotes of Painting,</HI> and Mr. Granger, in his <HI>Biographical History,</HI> might be added the follow∣ing notice from a reverend minister of the church of Scotland. <Q>About 1698 the women got a custome of wearing few garments: I myselfe have seen the young brisk ladies walking on the streets with masks on their faces, and with one onlie thin petticoat and their smoak; so thin that one would make a conscience of sweiring they were not naked.</Q> <HI>Miscellanies, by Mr. John Bell, minister at Gladsmuir,</HI> MS. pen. Edit. <HI>title</HI> Apparel.</P>
<P>V. 112. <HI>Save that of Fairly fair.</HI>] Working at the needle, &amp;c. was reckoned an honourable employment by the greatest ladies of those times. Margaret, the queen of Malcolm III. as we learn from her life written by <HI>Turgot</HI> her confessor, employed the leisure hours of her ladies in this manner. See Lord Hales' <HI>Annals of Scotland,</HI> an. 1093.</P>
<P>V. 121. <HI>Sir Knicht.</HI>] <Q>The addition <HI>Sir</HI> to the names of knights was in use before the age of Ed∣ward I. and is from <HI>Sire,</HI> which in old French signifies <HI>Seignieur</HI> or Lord. Though applicable to all knights it served properly to distinguish those of the order who were not barons. <BIBL>Dr. Stuart, <HI>View of Society,</HI> &amp;c. Notes <HI>on</HI> sect. 4. chap. ii. p. 269.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P><PB N="122" REF="185"/>V. 123—128. The custom of the ladies tending the wounded knights was common in those romantic ages. <HI>Lydgate,</HI> whose story is ancient, but whose man∣ners are those of his own times, has an instance in <HI>The Story of Thebes,</HI> part ii. Speaking of the daughter of Ly∣curgus and Tideus;
<Q><L>To a chamber she led him up aloft.</L>
<L>Full well beseine, there in a bed right soft,</L>
<L>Richly abouten apparrailed</L>
<L>With clothe of gold, all the floure irailed</L>
<L>Of the same both in length and brede:</L>
<L>And first this lady, of her womanhede,</L>
<L>Her women did bid, as goodly as they can,</L>
<L>To be attendant unto this wounded man:</L>
<L>And when he was unarmed to his shert,</L>
<L>She made first wash his woundis smert,</L>
<L>And serch hem well with divers instruments,</L>

<Q><L>Fetche me down my daughter deere,</L>
<L>She is a leeche fulle fine.</L>
<BIBL>v. 29, 30.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P><PB N="123" REF="186"/>V. 145—152.] This stanza is now first printed. It is surprising it's omission was not marked in the frag∣ment formerly published, as without it the circum∣stance of the knight's complaint is altogether foreign and vague. The loss was attempted to be glossed over by many variations of the preceding four lines, but the defect was palpable to the most inattentive peruser.</P>
<P>V. 154. <HI>Lord Chattan.</HI>] This is a very ancient and honourable Scottish surname. Some genealogists derive them from the <HI>Chatti,</HI> an ancient German tribe; but others, with more probability, from the <HI>Gilchattan</HI> of Ireland. St. <HI>Chattan</HI> was one of the first Scotish confessors, to whom was dedicated the priory of <HI>Ard∣chattan</HI> in Lorn, founded in 1230, and some others through the kingdom. The chief of the clan <HI>Chattan</HI> dying in the reign of David I. without male issue, the clan assumed the ancestor of the <HI>M'Phersons</HI> for su∣perior, by which means the name appears to have been lost in that of <HI>M'Pherson.</HI> See <HI>Buchanan's Brief Enquiry into the Genealogy and Present State of Ancient Scottish Surnames.</HI> Glasgow, 1723, 4 to, <HI>p.</HI> 67.</P>
<P>We however find the Clan Chattan mentioned as late as 1590 in <HI>The History of the Feuds and Conflicts of the Clans, published from a MS. of the reign of James VI.</HI> Glasgow, 1764; where a Macintosh is called their chief.</P>
<P><PB N="124" REF="187"/>V. 159.] Though we learn from <HI>Buchanan's Equiry,</HI> &amp;c. that the clan <HI>Chattan</HI> are said to have come into Scotland long before the expulsion of the Picts, yet I do not find this pretty anecdote, which is much in the spirit of Homer, has any foundation in history. The empire of the Picts was demolished by Kenneth about four centuries before the apparent date of the events narrated in this poem.</P>
<P>V. 169. <HI>Mak orisons,</HI> &amp;c.] This is perfectly in the style of knighthood. Before they entered into com∣bat they solemly invoked the aid of God, their Saviour, or their mistress: religion and gallantry being the prime motives of all their adventures. <HI>Les premieres leçons qu'on leur donnoit regardoient principalement l'amour de Dieu et des dames, c'est à dire la religion et la galanterie.</HI> St. Palaye, tome i. p. 7. The poets of these times be∣gan, in like manner, the description of a savage con∣flict, or of their lady's graces, with religious invocation. Many examples of which appear in the <HI>Histoire des Trou∣badours</HI> of L'Abbé Milot, and the <HI>Specimens of Welsh Poetry</HI> published by Mr. Evans. So blind is the untu∣tored mind to the proper discrimination of it's ideas!</P>
<P>V. 179. <HI>Playand Pibrochs.</HI>] Of the <HI>pibroch</HI> I can∣not give a better account than in the words of an ex∣cellent author. <Q>A pibroch is a species of tune pe∣culiar, I think, to the Highlands and Western Isles of Scotland. It is performed on a bagpipe, and differs totally from all other music. Its rythm is so irregu∣lar,
<PB N="125" REF="188"/>and its notes, especially in the quick movement, so mixed and huddled together, that a stranger finds it almost impossible to reconcile his ear to it, so as to perceive its modulation. Some of these <HI>pibrochs,</HI> being intended to represent a battle, begin with a grave mo∣tion resembling a march, then gradually quicken into the onset; run off with noisy confusion, and turbu∣lent rapidity, to imitate the conflict and pursuit; then swell into a few flourishes of triumphant joy; and perhaps close with the wild and slow wailings of a funeral procession. <BIBL><HI>Essays by Dr. Beattie,</HI> 8vo. ed. p. 422. <HI>note.</HI></BIBL></Q></P>
<P>V. 188. <HI>Eir faes their dint mote drie.</HI>] This is substi∣tuted in place of a line of consummate nonsense, which has stained all the former editions. Many such are cor∣rected in this impression from comparing different re∣hearsals, and still more from conjecture. When an ig∣norant person is desired to repeat a ballad, and is at a loss for the original expression, he naturally supplies it with whatever absurdity first occurs to him, that will form a rime. These the Editor made not the smallest scruple to correct, as he always imagined that common sense might have its use even in emendatory criticism.</P>
<P>V. 203. <HI>But on his forehead,</HI> &amp;c.] The circumstances in this description seem borrowed from those of different battles betwixt the Kings of Scotland and Norway. I find in no historian that Alexander was wounded in the battle of Largs; on the contrary, it is even doubted
<PB N="126" REF="189"/>whether he was present; but in that near <HI>Nairn</HI> Mal∣colm II. was wounded on the head. <HI>Rex, accepto in capite vulnere, vix a suis in propinquum nemus ablatus, ac ibi equo pofitus, mortem evasit.</HI> Buchan. lib. VI.</P>
<P>V. 223. <HI>Hire dames to wail your darling's fall.</HI>] This custom of employing women to mourn for the warriors who fell in battle, may be traced to the most distant antiquity. Lucilius, one of the earliest Roman poets, in a couplet preserved by Nonius, mentions this prac∣tice;
<Q><L><HI>Mercede quae conductae flent alieno in fanere praeficae</HI></L>
<L><HI>Multae &amp; capillos scindunt, &amp; clamant magis.</HI></L></Q> Among the Northern nations it partook of their bar∣barity. <Q>Inter eas autem ceremonias a barbara gente acceptas fuisse et has, ut genas roderunt mulierculae, hoc est unguibus faciem dilaniarent et <HI>lessum</HI> facerent, id est sanguinem e venis mitterent, doloris testandi ergo; id quod Germani patria voce dicunt, <HI>Ein lassu thun oder baben.</HI> <BIBL>Elias Schedius <HI>de Diis Germ.</HI> Syng. II. c. 51.</BIBL></Q> A similar mode of testifying their grief for the death of their chiefs, still obtains in the Highlands, as we are informed by Mr. Pennant in his amusing <HI>Tour in Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>V. 225. <HI>Costly Jupe.</HI>] This was the <HI>Sagum,</HI> or mili∣tary vest of the Gauls and Germans. Dr. Stuart has with curious ingenuity derived the science of Blazonry from the ornaments which were in time added to them. <HI>Ubi supra,</HI> p. 286, 287.</P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="190"/>Virgil has a passage remarkably similar to this, in describing the habit of the Gauls, I think in Aeneid VIII.
<Q><L>Aurea caesaries illis, atque aurea vestis</L>
<L>Virgatis lucet sagulis.</L></Q></P>
<P>V. 229. <HI>Beir Norse that gift,</HI> &amp;c.] This has been generally misunderstood: the meaning is, <HI>Bear that gift to the King of Norway, and bid,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>V. 239. 245.] These vaunts are much in Homer's manner, and are finely characteristic. The obscure metaphor which conveys them illustrates a beautiful re∣mark of an ancient critic, That allegory has a sublime effect when applied to threatning. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. Demet. Phal. de Eloc. c. 99.</P>
<P>V. 265. <HI>Whar lyke a fyre to hether set.</HI>] This apposite simile alludes to an ancient practice of the Scots, termed <HI>Mure burning.</HI> The progress of the flame was so quick, that many laws appear in their Acts of Parliament, pro∣hibiting its being used when any corn was standing on ground adjacent to the heath intended to be burnt, though at a considerable distance from the spot where the flame was kindled.</P>
<P>V. 285. <HI>Sore taken he was, fey!</HI>] <HI>Fey</HI> here signifies only indeed, <HI>in fay,</HI> or, in faith: it is commonly used by the old Scotish poets in a sarcastic or ironical sense.</P>
<P><PB N="128" REF="191"/>V. 305. <HI>On Norway's coast,</HI> &amp;c.] These verses are in the finest style of Ballad poetry. They have been well imitated by a modern writer, who seems indebted, for the best strokes of his first production, to a taste for such compositions:
<Q><L>Ye dames of Denmark! even for you I feel,</L>
<L>Who, sadly sitting on the sea-beat shore,</L>
<L>Long look for Lords that never shall return,</L>
<BIBL><HI>Douglas,</HI> Act III.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>I cannot conclude my observations upon the descrip∣tion here given of the battle, without adding, that though perhaps not the most sublime, it is the most animated and interesting to be found in any poet. It yields not to any in Ossian for lively painting, nor to any in Homer for those little anecdotes and strokes of nature, which are so deservedly admired in that mas∣ter. 'Poetry and Rhetoric,' says the author of an En∣quiry into the origin of our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful, <Q>do not succeed in exact description so well as Painting does; their business is to affect rather by sympathy than imitation; to display rather the effect of things on the mind of the speaker, or of others, than to present a clear idea of the things themselves. This is their most extensive province, and that in which they succeed the best.</Q> Will he forgive me if I offer this rude Scotish Poem as an example sufficiently illustrative of this fine remark?</P>
<P><PB N="129" REF="192"/>V. 321. <HI>Loud and chill blew the Westlin wind,</HI> &amp;c.] This storm is artfully raised by the magic of Poetry to heighten the terrible, which is soon carried to a degree not surpassed in any production ancient or modern. It will recall to the reader the like artifice employed in the most sublime passage of <HI>Tasso's Gierusalemme,</HI> end of Canto 7.; and of <HI>Homer's Iliad,</HI> VIII. ver. 161. of Mr. Pope's Translation.</P>
<P>V. 327. <HI>Seimd now as black as moruning weid.</HI>] It was anciently the custom on any mournful event to hang the castle gates with black cloth. This is alluded to here, and more particularly mentioned in an excellent modern Ballad, entitled <HI>The Birth of St. George,</HI> which displays no mean knowledge of the manners of chivalry:
<Q><L>But when he reached his castle gate</L>
<L>His gate was hung with black.</L>

<P>I HAVE given the stanzas now added the title of a Second Part, though I had no authority from the recital. The break formerly made here by accident seemed to call for this pause to the reader.</P>
<P>V. 115. <HI>Penants.</HI>] These were small banners charged with the arms of the owner, and sometimes borne over the helm of the ancient knight by his squire, and, as would seem, even that of the prince, Earl, or Chief Baron, by his Baneret. See ver. 331. The English word is <HI>penon:</HI>

<P>V. 252. <HI>Draffan's touirs.</HI>] The ruins of Draffan∣castle are in Lanarkshire.—They stand upon a vast rock hanging over the <HI>Nethan</HI> (see v. 329.) which a little below runs into the <HI>Clyde.</HI> From this a house situated very nigh the ruins is called <HI>Craignethan.</HI> This castle is so ancient, that the country people there say it was built by the <HI>Pechts,</HI> which is their common way of expressing the <HI>Picts.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="131" REF="194"/>V. 273. <HI>His halbrik.</HI>] This term for a coat of mail occurs in <HI>Blind Harry.</HI> It was properly used for one composed of small rings of steel which yielded to every motion of the warrior, and was the same with the <HI>lorica hamata</HI> of the Romans, so picturesquely described by Claudian:

But nothing was found in them, but a little close parchment bag full of magical
<PB N="133" REF="196"/>characters, and wordes of enchantment, wherein it seemed that hee had put his confidence, thinking him∣self never safe without them, and therefore ever car∣ried them about with him; being also observed, that while they were upon him, his wound, whereof he died, bled not; but incontinent, after the taking of them away, the blood gushed out in great abundance, to the great admiration of all the beholders.</Q> See likewise <HI>Memoirs of the Affairs of Scotland, by David Moyses,</HI> Edin. 1755. where this piece is reprinted <HI>ver∣batim.</HI> Maister William Rynd, a servant of Lord Gowrie's, deposition in the same volume, <HI>p.</HI> 297, has singular anecdotes with regard to these <HI>characters.</HI></P>
<P>V. 276. Fairy <HI>charm.</HI>] The word <HI>fairy</HI> seemes to have been accepted by the ancient English and Scotish poets for <HI>supernatural,</HI> or <HI>enchanted.</HI> So Chaucer speaking of <HI>Cambuscan's</HI> horse, <Q>It was of fairie, as the peple semed.
<BIBL><HI>Squires Tale,</HI> p. 1.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>V. 362.] It was the priviledge of the knights to hide their faces with armour, so that it was impossible to distinguish any one from another, except by his <HI>blazon,</HI> which seems at first to have been displayed over them, but came at length to be painted on their shields, whence <HI>Coats of Arms.</HI> A <HI>villein</HI> was obliged to have his countenance uncovered in battle. This circumstance attended to will save our wonder at Hardyknute's not
<PB N="134" REF="197"/>knowing Draffan in the First Part, and Draffan's not perceiving Malcolm here till his spear tore off his visor: though Rothiay knows Draffan either from his wearing a <HI>blazon</HI> on his armour, or from his face being uncovered in order to breathe from the combat.</P>
<P>V. 389. <HI>Cheir ye my</HI> mirrie men, &amp;c.] It should have been remarked on the first appearance of this word, P. I. v. 199, that <HI>mirrie</HI> was anciently used in a very different sense from its present. It signified <HI>honest, true, faithful,</HI> but no where <HI>jovial.</HI> King James VI. in his <HI>Daemonologie</HI> MS. <HI>pen.

<P>V. 413. <HI>Oh King of Hevin!</HI>] This is a common ap∣pellation of the Deity with the more ancient Scottish Poets. <HI>By Hevins King,</HI> is the familiar oath of <HI>Blind Harrie's</HI> heroes.</P>
<P>V. 419. <HI>By my Forbere's saul.</HI>] Swearing by the souls of their ancestors was another used mode in those times. The greatest thought this oath most strong and honour∣able; probably because it implied the souls of their forefathers were in heaven, and, as was then believed, might lend them a supernatural aid, if the intention of their oath was just and unblameable.</P>
<P>V. 421. '<HI>Now mind your aith,</HI>' &amp;c.] This passage is obscure: the meaning I apprehend is, that Draffan
<PB N="135" REF="198"/>had, before the combat, exacted an oath of Allan his baneret, that he would slay him, should the necessity of his affairs demand this sacrifice. More willing to lose his own life than possibly to take that of his great anta∣gonist, he commands Allan to fulfil his engagement, which, with all the heroic faith of those times, he does without a pause. The particular expression <Q><HI>The</HI> shynand blade</Q> might lead us to imagine, that it was thought impossible to pierce the supposed enchanted armour, but with one particular weapon, likeways perhaps <HI>charmed.</HI></P>
<P>V. 437. <HI>Icolm.</HI>] The Nunnery at Icolm, or Icolm∣kill, was one of the most noted in Scotland. The Nuns were of the order of <HI>Augustine,</HI> and wore a white gown, and above it a rocket of fine linen. <HI>Spotiswood's Account of the Religious Houses in Scotland,</HI> p. 509. The ruins of this nunnery are still to be seen, with many tombs of the Princesses; one of which bears the year 1000. <HI>Martin's Western Islands,</HI> p. 262.</P>
<P>I cannot conclude my remarks on this Poem without wasting one on the story of Mrs. Wardlaw. That this lady may have indeed received a MS. of it as mentioned in Dr. Percy's introductory note, is highly probable. Many valuable MSS. prepared for the press, have had a worse fate. But that she was the author of this capital composition, so fraught with science of ancient manners as the above notes testify, I will no more credit, than that the common people in Lanarkshire,
<PB N="136" REF="199"/>who can repeat scraps of both the parts, are the authors of the passages they rehearse. That she did not refuse the name of being the original composer is a strange argument: would not the first poet in Europe think it added to his reputation? If conjecture may be allowed where proof must ever be wanting, I suspect, if we assign the end of the fifteenth century as the date of the antique parts of this noble production, we shall not greatly err; though at the same time the language must convince us that many strokes have been bestowed by modern hands.</P>
<P>Since the first publication of this volume, Sir David Dalrymple, Lord Hales, whose abilities have been so often, and so successfully, exerted in illustrating the antiquities of his country, to the law and the literature of which he is so great an ornament, has communi∣cated to the Editor some notices with regard to this poem of Hardyknute, which shall here be laid before the reader, almost in his own words.</P>
<P>The following are extracts of a letter written by Sir John Bruce of Kinross, to Lord Binning, about the year 1719.</P>
<P><Q>To perform my promise, I send you a true copy of the manuscript I found, some weeks ago, in a vault at Dumferline. It is written on vellum in a fair Gothic character; but so much defaced by time, as you'll find that the tenth part is not legible.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="137" REF="200"/>Sir John transcribes some stanzas, which he calls <HI>verses.</HI> After l. 112, P. I. he says, <Q>here are four verses defaced,</Q> and then he transcribes l. 113.</P>
<P>At l. 128 he adds, <HI>hiatus in MS.</HI> and then he tran∣scribes l. 153. At l. 320 he says, <Q>Here are ten verses (stanzas) so spoilt that I can only guess by the many proper names, that they contain the order of battle of the Scots army, as they stood ranged under their different chieftains.</Q></P>
<P>In conclusion Sir John says, <Q>there's a vast deal more of it, but all defaced.</Q></P>
<P>The reader is left to judge whether this story of the manuscript on vellum, &amp;c. has most the appearance of a true narrative, or of a <HI>jeu d' esprit</HI> addressed to a fami∣liar friend.</P>
<P>Lord Hales has a copy of the original edition of Har∣dyknute, with MS. alterations, in the hand writing of Dr. John Clerk, Physician in Edinburgh. At l. 85, it has '<HI>brade</HI> Thomas;' Sir John Bruce has <Q><HI>bred</HI> Mal∣colm.</Q> At l. 98, Sir John Bruce's MS. has 'Walter' instead of 'Malcolm.' At l. 103, 'brazen' for 'silver;' and at l. 104, 'iron doors,' for <Q>painted bowers.</Q></P>
<P>In Dr. Clerk's MS. lines, 176—180 run thus;
<Q><L>To join his king adown the hill,</L>
<L>In hast his strides he bent;</L>
<L>While minstrels playand pibrochs fine,</L>
<L>Afore him stately went.</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="138" REF="201"/>In Dr. Clerk's MS. the stanza <HI>On Norway's coast,</HI> &amp;c. comes in after the stanza <HI>There on a lee</HI> with much pro∣priety: that reading is therefore followed in this edi∣tion.</P>
<P><Q><L>At l. 337. for 'owr' the MS. has 'oy'.</L>
<L>The last line in the MS. was originally,</L>
<L>He feared a coud be feared;</L></Q> but has been changed into that which occurs in later editions.</P>

<HEAD>CHILD MAURICE.</HEAD>
<P>THIS is undoubtedly the true title of this incom∣parable Ballad, though corrupted into Gil Mor∣rice by the nurses and old women, from whose mouths it was originally published. <HI>Child</HI> seems to have been of equal importance with <HI>Damoiseau</HI> (See note on P. I. v. 49. of Hardyknute) and applicable to a young noble∣man when about the age of fifteen. It occurs in Shak∣speare's Lear, in the following line, probably borrowed from some old romance or ballad,
<Q><L>Child Roland to the dark tower came.</L>
<BIBL>Act III. S. 7.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P><PB N="139" REF="202"/>And in Chaucer's <HI>Rime of Sir Topas, Child</HI> is evidently used to denote a young and noble knight. Many in∣stances might likewise be brought from Spenser for this signification.</P>
<P>Gil Morrice is only the northern pronunciation of the true name of this ballad: <HI>Gil</HI> about Aberdeen, &amp;c, still signifies <HI>Child,</HI> as it does in Galic; witness the name <HI>Gilchrist,</HI> the child of Christ, &amp;c.</P>
<P>V. 52. <HI>He bent his bow.</HI>] Archery was enjoined the Scotish warrior at a very early age, as appears from many special laws to that effect, and particularly the following one of James I. <Q>Item, That all men busk them to be Archeres fra they be <HI>twelfe yeir of age,</HI> and that in ilk ten pundis worthe of lande their be maid bowmarkis, and speciallie neir to Paroche kirkis, quhairin upon haly daies men may cum, and at the leist schutte thrise about, and have usage of archerie: and quha sa usis not the said archerie, the Laird of the lande sall raise of him a wedder; and giff the Laird raises not the said payne, the King's schireffe or his ministers, shall raise it to the King. <BIBL><HI>Parl.</HI> I. § 18.</BIBL></Q></P>

<P>V. 107, 8. <HI>O what means a the folk coming? My mother tarries lang.</HI>] This stroke of nature is delicate. It paints the very thought of youth and innocence. In such happy <HI>tenuity</HI> of phrase, this exquisite composi∣tion is only rivalled by the <HI>Merope</HI> of <HI>Maffei,</HI> the most finished Tragedy in the world.

<P>V. 122. <HI>And slaided owr the strae.</HI>] The meaning is, <HI>He went bastily over the rank grass.</HI></P>
<P>V. 144. <HI>As the hip is o the stean.</HI>] This would appear the corruption of some nurse; but taking it as it stands, the simile, though none of the most delicate, has a parallel in the Father of English Poetry:
<Q><L>But he was chaste and no lechoure</L>
<L>And sweet as is the bramble floure</L>

<P>'But to return to Gordon,' <HI>(viz.</HI> Sir Adam Gordon of Auchindown, brother to the Earl of Huntly) <Q>as these two actions against Forbes, or, to speak more properly, against the rebels, gained him a vast repu∣tation—his next exploit was attended with an equal portion of infamy; and he was as much decryed for this unlucky action (though at the same time he had no immediate hand in the matter) as for his former ones he had been applauded. He had sent one <HI>Captain Ker</HI> with a party of foot to summon the Castle of <HI>Towie</HI> in the Queen's name. The owner Alexander Forbes was not then at home, and his lady confiding too much in her sex, not only refused to surrender, but gave Ker very injurious language; upon which, unreasonably transported with fury, he ordered his men to fire the castle, and barbarously burnt the unfortunate gentlewoman with her whole family, amounting to thirty-seven persons. Nor was he ever so much as cashiered for this inhuman action, which made Gordon share both in the scandal and the guilt. <BIBL><HI>An.</HI> 1571. <HI>p.</HI> 240. <HI>edit.</HI> 1706.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P><PB N="142" REF="205"/>In this narrative is immediately perceived every lead∣ing circumstance in the Ballad. The <HI>Captain Car,</HI> by which name it was distinguished in Dr. Percy's Manu∣script, is evidently the <HI>Ker</HI> of Crawford. The House of <HI>Rodes</HI> I have corrected, according to the truth of story, <HI>Towie.</HI> Of which name, I find in <HI>Gordon of Straloch's</HI> map of Aberdeenshire, there were two gentlemen's seats, or castles, in his time, one upon the <HI>Don,</HI> and another upon the <HI>Ythan.</HI> The nearest seat to the latter is that of <HI>Rothy,</HI> which from wrong information may have originally stood in the Ballad, the mistake rising naturally from the vicinity of their situation, and from this have been corrupted to <HI>Rodes.</HI> The courage of this lady, as represented in the Ballad, was equalled by that of the famous Countess of Salisbury, at the siege of Roxborough; and of Ladies Arundel and Banks, in the last civil wars of England.

<P>John Faw was king of the gypsies in Scotland in the reign of James IV. who, about the year 1495, issued a proclamation, ordaining all sheriffs, &amp;c. to assist John Faw in seizing and securing fugitive gypsies; and that they should lend him their prisons, stocks, fetters, &amp;c. for that purpose: charging the lieges, that none of them molest, vex, unquiet, or trouble the said Faw
<PB N="144" REF="207"/>and his company in doing their <HI>lawful business</HI> within the realm; and in their passing, remaining, or going forth of the same, under penalty: and charging skip∣pers, masters of ships, and mariners, within the realm, at all ports and havens, to receive said John and his company, upon their expences, for furthering them furth of the realm to parts beyond sea. See <HI>Mr. Mac∣laurin's Remarkable Cases,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>p.</HI> 774.</P>
<P>V. 8. <HI>Glamour.</HI>] The <HI>glamour</HI> was believed to be a kind of magical mist raised by sorcerers, which deluded their spectators with visions of things which had no real existence, altered the appearance of these which really did exist, &amp;c. The Eastern nations have a similar superstition, as we may learn from Mr. Galland's <HI>Mille et un nuit,</HI> and other translations of works of Oriental fiction.</P>
<P>SIR HUGH, OR THE JEW's DAUGHTER, is composed of two copies, one published by Dr. Percy, the other in a collection of Scotish Songs, &amp;c. <HI>Edin.</HI> 1776.

<P>THE stanzas here given form a complete copy of this exquisite Dirge. The inimitable beauty of the original induced a variety of versifiers to mingle stanzas of their own composure. But it is the painful, though most necessary duty of an Editor, by the touch∣stone of truth, to discriminate such dross from the gold of antiquity.</P>
<P>SIR PATRICK SPENCE is given from Dr. Percy's Edition, which indeed agrees with the stall copies, and the common recitals. I have, however, lent it a few corrections, where palpable ab∣surdity seemed to require them. The phrase in v. 25. of seeing the old moon <HI>in the arms</HI> of the new is still fa∣miliar in Scotland. It means that the opaque part of the moon's disk casts a glimmering light, while the illumi∣nated part is waxing; and is to this hour esteemed to prognosticate a storm.</P>

<HEAD>LADY BOTHWELL's LAMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THESE four stanzas appeared to the Editor to be all that are genuine in this elegy. Many additional ones are to be found in the common copies, which are rejected as of meaner execution. In a quarto manu∣script in the Editor's possession, containing a collection of Poems by different hands from the reign of Queen Elizabeth to the middle of the last century, when it was apparently written (<HI>pp.</HI> 132.) there are two <HI>Balowes</HI> as they are there styled, the first <HI>The Balow, Allan,</HI> the se∣cond <HI>Palmer's Balow;</HI> this last is that commonly called Lady Bothwell's Lament, and the three first stanzas in this edition are taken from it, as is the last from <HI>Allan's Balow.</HI> They are injudiciously mingled in Ram∣say's Edition, and several stanzas of his own added; a liberty he used much too often in printing ancient Scotish poems.</P>

<P>V. last. <HI>Toun.</HI>] This word is often used in Scotland to denote only, perhaps, a farm-house and office-houses, or a number of hovels scattered here and there; and on which the English would not bestow the name of a village.</P>
<P><PB N="147" REF="210"/>A very eminent Scotish antiquary informs me, that in Saxon <HI>ton</HI> signifies an habitation: and that <HI>castle downe</HI> in the last stanza of this ballad ought to be read <HI>Castle Downe,</HI> the seat of Lord Murray in his own right.</P>
<P>SIR JAMES THE ROSE is given from a modern edition in one sheet 12mo. after the old copy. A renovation of this Ballad, composed of new and improbable circumstances, decked out with scraps of tragedies, may be found in the Annual Re∣gister for 1774, and other collections. <HI>Rose</HI> is an an∣cient and honourable name in Scotland: <HI>Johannes de Rose</HI> is a witness to the famous Charter of <HI>Robert</HI> II. testifying his marriage with <HI>Elizabeth More,</HI> as appears in the rare edition of it printed at Paris, 1695, 4to. <HI>p.</HI> 15.</P>

<HEAD>ARGUMENT.</HEAD>
<P><Q>The description of the fourth kynde of Spreitis, called the <HI>Pharie.</HI> What is possible chairin, and what is but illusions. Whow far this dialogue entreates of all thir thingis: and to what ende.</Q></P>
<P><Q><HI>P.</HI> Now I pray you come on to that fourt kynd of spreittis. <HI>E.</HI> That fourt kynde of Spreitis, quhilk be the gentiles was called Diana and her wandring court, and amongs us was called the <HI>Pharie</HI> (as I tolde you) or our guid neighbouris</Q> (the King has added on the margin 'or sillie wightis') <Q>was ane of the sortis of allusions that was ryfest in tyme of Papistrie; for all∣though it was holdin odious to prophesie be the devill, yet whome these kynd of spreittis caried away, and informed, thay wer thought to be sonciest, and of best lyfe. To speak of the manie vaine tratlis foundit upon that illusion; how thair was ane king and queine of <HI>Pharie,</HI> of sic a jolie court and traine as thay had; how thay had a teind and a dewtie, as it wer, of all guidis: how thay naturallie raid and yeld, eat and drank, and did all other actions lyke naturall men and wemen; I think it is lyker Virgilis <HI>Campi Elisei,</HI> nor any thing that aught to be beleived be Chris∣tianis.</Q></P>
<P>This Manuscript is written in a beautiful Italic hand, so nearly resembling copper-plate engraving, as to have been taken for such even after accurate examination. It is bound in gilded vellum, stamped with the King's eypher beneath the crown; and is in all probability the
<PB N="150" REF="213"/>original copy of this royal monument of superstition. Many additions are inserted on the margin, as would seem, of the hand-writing of James VI. and some notes for his own private use. As for instance on <HI>B.</HI> II. <HI>ch.</HI> 1. speaking of the Magicians of his time, over against the words <Q>Thay are sume of thame riche and worldlie wyse,</Q> he has noted <HI>F.

<P>We need not wonder at the severity with which the imaginary crime of withcraft was punished in his reign, when we remark his sentiment expressed on this head, in <HI>B.</HI> III. <HI>ch.</HI> 6. of this singular tract. <Q><HI>P.</HI> Then to make ane ende of our conference sence I see it drawis leatt, what forme of punishment think ye merites thir Magiciens and Witches? For I see that ye account thame to be all alyke giltie. E. <HI>(The King) Thay aught to be put to deathe,</HI> according to the law of God, the civill and imperiall law, and the municipal law of all Christiane nations. <HI>P.</HI> But what kynde of death I pray you? <HI>E.</HI> It is commonly used be fyre, but that is ane indifferent thing to be used in every countrey according to the law or custume thairof. <HI>P. But aught no sexe, aage, nor rank, to be eximed?</HI> E. NONE AT ALL.</Q></P>

<HEAD>LORD AIRTH's COMPLAINT.</HEAD>
<P>THESE verses, though somewhat uncouth, are moving, as they seem to flow from the heart. They are now first published from the Editor's quarto Manu∣script, <HI>p.</HI> 16. corrected in some lines, which appeared too inaccurate for the publick eye. Two entire stanzas are rejected from the same cause. I know nothing of the nobleman to whom they are ascribed.</P>
<P>In the same Manuscript <HI>(p.</HI> 17. and 116) are to be found the two following Poems, which I believe have never been in print. They are here added, with a few corrections. They were both written by Sir Robert Aytoun, who bore some office under government in the reign of James VI. if I mistake not. His Latin poems are in the Delitiae Poetarum Scotorum.</P>
