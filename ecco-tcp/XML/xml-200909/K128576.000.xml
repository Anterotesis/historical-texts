<HEAD>TO THE NOBLEMEN, GENTLEMEN AND Proprietors of Lands in Scotland, and Inhabitants at large.</HEAD>
<P>SCOTLAND as a part of the united kingdoms altho' having a right to the same protection from Government with its sister kingdom, <HI>England;</HI> yet labours under some hardships, and even imposed by Act of Parliament, which the people of <HI>England</HI> know nothing about. And these are Burrow duties known by the name of <HI>imposts</HI> on <HI>Malt Liquors,</HI> which have of late years spread themselves as a plague over the face of this country. They began first in the capital of the kingdom in the year 1693, an aera, when few classes of men in this country knew their rights and privileges as subjects, or if they had been as well understood as at present, were unacquainted with the mode of application to parliament; all of which circumstances, contributed to the Bill in fa∣vours of the town of <HI>Edinburgh</HI> passing without op∣position imposing a duty of <HI>two pennies Scots</HI> on the pint of all <HI>malt liquors</HI> brewed, tap'd, or vended with∣in
<PB N="2" REF="2" MS="y"/>the privileges of said city. From which not only the Burrows and towns of consequence, but every petty town have taken the hint, and have succes∣sively applied to Parliament for similar Acts, and is now become almost an universal tax on this coun∣try, <HI>viz.</HI> the towns of <HI>Edinburgh, Glasgow, Dundee, Dunbar, Kelso, Arbroath, Dalkeith, Preston-pans, Bo-ness, Paisley, Port-glasgow, Greenock,</HI> &amp;c. and there is great reason to believe, that private gentle∣men, who have the smallest villages situated on na∣vigable rivers, and who are not yet arrived at such a degree of consequence as to have a magistrate of any kind, allured by the surprising revenue which this tax raises, intend applying to Parliament for grants of the same nature; and Parliament, by no opposition hav∣ing ever been made, have overlooked them as un∣connected either with the revenue, the landed in∣terest, or the welfare of the people in general, but which are connected with all these three to a degree of more consequence than is in general understood or attended to.</P>
<P>It is the universal complaint, that the <HI>malt liquors</HI> of <HI>Scotland,</HI> particularly <HI>porter</HI> and <HI>pale malt liquors,</HI> are not equal in quality to that brewed in <HI>London,</HI>
<PB N="3" REF="3"/>and the other towns in <HI>England,</HI> but it ceases to be a matter of any wonder, when the Public are informed that the <HI>malt liquors</HI> of <HI>Scotland</HI> is loaded with 30 <HI>per cent.</HI> of the King's excise in <HI>impost</HI> payable to royal borrows and other smaller towns.</P>
<P>The trifling opinion, which the country entertains of <HI>two pennies Scots,</HI> and mankind in general of the fractions of a penny, has made this oppressive tax pass unnoticed, not only by parliament, but by the landed interest of this country, both of whom ought to have set themselves in opposition to so partial and oppressive a burthen on this part of the kingdom. Trifling as <HI>two pennies Scots</HI> may appear, when taken by the pint, it is no less than 1 s. sterling on every 9 gallons which is 1/9 of the whole value of <HI>malt liquor</HI> at 1 s. <HI>per</HI> gallon; but burthensome and oppressive as this must appear to every considerate person, it is enormous when considered as a tax added to the ex∣cise, which is so heavy already, that when Lord North in the year 1779, laid 5 <HI>per cent.</HI> on the amount of the customs and excise, out of compassion to the laborious part of the nation who are the consumers of <HI>malt liquors,</HI> he exempted the brewery in both kingdoms; and in his subsequent taxes he has still
<PB N="4" REF="4"/>paid such an attention to the brewery (no doubt from a consciousness of its not being able to bear more) that he has all along exempted it, and even in the additional taxes on the <HI>malt,</HI> he provided a drawback of 10 d. <HI>per</HI> barrel on all <HI>malt liquor</HI> above the de∣nomination of <HI>small beer,</HI> and 3 d. <HI>per</HI> barrel on this last species, in lieu of the additional duty on the <HI>malt,</HI> and altho' this drawback is not an exact equivalent for the additional duty on the <HI>malt,</HI> yet it is plain he meant it to be so, according to the best of his judg∣ment and the information he had

For the above two barrels of <HI>malt liquor,</HI> which is 21⅓ gallons, the brewer in <HI>Scotland</HI> pays 2 s. 4 d⅓. of <HI>im∣post,</HI> which every body will find that will take the trouble of calculating is upon 8 s. 3 d. the amount of the excise on a barrel of <HI>porter</HI> and a barrel of <HI>small beer,</HI> no less than within the meerest trifle of 30 <HI>per cent.</HI> upon the amount of the duty taken com∣plexly; and on <HI>small beer</HI> is no less than the exact double duty. What would the Noblemen and Gen∣tlemen
<PB N="5" REF="5"/>and Inhabitants of <HI>Scotland</HI> say, were Govern∣ment to lay a double tax or even 30 <HI>per cent.</HI> on the <HI>malt liquor</HI> of Scotland more than in England? The very mention of it must strike every person of any consideration with astonishment, how any species of manufacture could support such a load of taxes, especially when it is considered that the price of no kind of <HI>malt liquor</HI> has been raised in Scotland, not∣withstanding of this enormous local tax. The fact is, that at the time the <HI>impost</HI> was imposed, the brewers found themselves in possession of a pretty good trade from the very low price of materials at that time, and having no denomination of money equivolent to <HI>two pennies</HI> Scots the amount of the tax, and not being allowed by the law to add it to the price of the pint or gallon, without exposing themselves to be charged the next highest duty, <HI>viz. strong ale,</HI> were under the necessity, in order to indemnify themselves of taking the value of the tax (which is one ninth) out of the quality of the liquor.</P>
<P>Every body will see what a debasement of the li∣quor would ensue by taking the ninth part of malt out of the quality; to this debasement of the liquor must be attributed the decrease of the brewing busi∣ness
<PB N="6" REF="6"/>in Scotland, which is evidently demonstrated by the decrease of the malt tax, as any body may be in∣formed of, by appyling to the Excise Office at Edin∣burgh. This debasement of the liquor does not operate in a common and ordinary proportion on the interest of the country, but in a threefold proportion. It is not only the loss of 1/9 part of the consumption of the barley to the landed interest and to the farmer, but also 1/9 part of the revenue of the malt tax to Go∣vernment, besides this debasement of the <HI>malt liquor,</HI> makes at the most moderate calculation 1/9 less con∣sumption of the liquor that is brewed, and 1/9 de∣crease of quantity of malt is 2/9=¼ nearly, (being only 1/36 part less) so that it is plain this tax does not operate to the prejudice of the revenue as 1/9, but as ¼ decrease on the revenue of <HI>malt,</HI> likewise not as 1/9 but as ¼ decrease of barley to the prejudice of the landed interest.</P>
<P>This tax in proportion as it decreases the revenue of the <HI>malt</HI> tax 2/9, it decreases the revenue of the ex∣cise on the ale in the proportion of one ninth less con∣sumed than would have been if this tax had not taken place, so that it affects government in no less a pro∣portion than 3/9, or ⅓ loss on the revenue of excise in Scotland.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="7"/>The author might have availed himself of Mr. Arnot's is history of Edinburgh, <HI>page</HI> 521, for the in∣contestible evidence of the above facts, (who had full access to the records of the city) wherein he shows, that in the year 1724, at or after the time that the town obtained an act extending the impost to the parishes of St. <HI>Cuthbert</HI>'s, <HI>Canongate, South</HI> and <HI>North Leiths,</HI> that the revenue of the impost paid to the town of <HI>Edinburgh</HI> was no less a sum annually in the year

During the period betwixt 169<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> first act the town of Edinburgh procured for levying an impost, which was confined to the city alone, the impost did not exceed <HI>l.</HI> 4000 annually, because, as soon as the act took place, the greatest part of the brewers either removed out of the town, or settled in the invirons of the city, which included the above parishes. The a∣mount of this noble income of <HI>l.</HI> 7939 16 <HI>s.</HI> shews in the most forcible manner the great extent and flourishing state of the brewing business at said period. For at 16 d. every 12 gallons, equal to an English barrel of
<PB N="8" REF="8"/>36 <HI>Winchester</HI> gallons, it is 119, 097 barrels, and in the year 1776, a period not seven years ago, the num∣ber of barrels brewed, and consequently that paid revenue to government (for the town of <HI>Edinburgh</HI> takes the charge of the impost from the gaugers re∣turn) was no more than 32, 955 barrels, so that there is an annual decrease, comparing these two periods to∣gether, of 86, 142 barrels, and suppposing them all <HI>two penny ale,</HI> and at the old duty of 2 s. <HI>per</HI> barrel, is no less a sum than an annual loss to Government of <HI>l.</HI> 8614 12 s. on the excise only, for the presumption is, that the revenue on the brewery, would not have fallen short of the above quantity, had the <HI>impost act</HI> not taken place, as the nation instead of a retrograde motion toward<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ension has been advancing since that period, (<HI>viz.</HI> the year 1724) in a rapid progress to wealth and opulence, and therefore no other good cause can be assigned for the decrease of the revenue on this article, but the debasement of the liquor which took place in consequence thereof. On the same principle the <HI>malt duty</HI> has likewise fallen short in proportion, for 119, 097 barrels the amount of the quantity brewed in the year 1724 in the city of <HI>Edin∣burgh,</HI> allowing six bushels <HI>Winchester</HI> measure to e∣very 2¼ barrels or 27 gallons of <HI>two penny,</HI> will take

<P>Few instances, perhaps, have occurred that shews in a more forcible light the dangerous tendency of ad∣mitting the most trifling tax to be levied on a com∣mon necessary of life. This estimation the author hopes, will be thought very moderate, when it is considered, that additional duties have been laid on both <HI>malt</HI> and <HI>ale;</HI> and the price of materials have been annually advancing during the above period, all of which shews, that the author's supposition of 1/9 less consumption of ale in consequence of the impost tax taking place in this country, from which all these calculations, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> taken, <HI>Are too, too well founded,</HI> more especially when it is considered, that the above enor∣mous sum has been lost to the country on the con∣sumption of Edinburgh alone, exclusive of all the other parts of Scotland.</P>
<P>The author hopes, what he has said, will meet the attention of the Noblemen and Gentlemen, Lords of Council and Session, Barons of Exchequer, and Commissioners of Customs and Excise, as likewise the worthy Manufacturers and useful Mechanic and
<PB N="11" REF="11"/>Labourer, who are also interested that this oppressive tax should be abolished in Scotland, to put them on a footing with their brethren manufacturers and la∣bourers in England, as also house-holders of all de∣nominations, whose interest it is to have as in Eng∣land, a nourishing, sound and wholesome malt liquor.</P>
<P>The <HI>impost acts</HI> have the effect of a monoply against the inhabitants of every town where it is established, in loading with an additional tax, one of the com∣modities of life, and prevents people at a distance from relieving them by serving them better and cheaper than their own brewers either can or choose to do, it being the interest of every community, to open the most free communication for all sorts of provisions, and therefore it is their interest to op∣pose all such Acts.</P>
<P>In short, it is the interest of the community at large, and of the inhabitants of towns in particular to guard against magistrates introducing by act of par∣liament, and without their own consent; any species of taxation, and carefully watching over any bill in its progress through the House of Commons, and the author of this address takes the liberty to advise the inhabitants of corporated towns in all cases where magistrates propose getting new acts of parliament,
<PB N="12" REF="12"/>to chuse a committee of the most worthy and re∣spectful of their number, unconnected with the council, to watch over the steps the magistrates and council take in such a piece of business, and that they would always employ a council at law to take care of their interest in the House of Commons, the ex∣pence of which would be a mere trifle. But of all the ranks of men in the community, he would advise the brewers in Scotland at large, to be upon their guard when any revenue laws are applied for, more especially those whose avowed purpose is to subject them alone to a tax exclusive of the rest of the inha∣bitants, as all impost taxes on malt liquor are—taxes to the prejudice of the revenue, the landed interest, and the ruin of a respectable rank of citizens, who are subjected <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> partial, local and unequal tax which their brethren the brewers of England know no∣thing about.</P>
<P>It has been said, and is still averred by the abettors of this tax, that it is the inhabitants that pay the tax and not the brewers, and as this doctrine is industri∣ously propagated among the inhabitants of the diffe∣rent towns, the author begs the reader's indulgence, until he explodes this magisterial doctrine calculated
<PB N="13" REF="13"/>to mislead the well meaning citizen who would spurn the idea of contributing by his consent to load his neighbour and fellow-citizen with a burthensome and oppressive tax, of which he himself bears no part. It is well known that two-penny ale, at the Union of the two kingdoms, was sold at two-pence the Scots pint, the brewer had then the malt 50 <HI>per Cent.</HI> cheaper than at present, and yet every body knows, that the two-penny ale all over Scotland, is sold at the same price at this very moment. If this is the fact, the author begs the favour that the advocates for this impost tax will say, where the impost (which is ⅙ of a penny) is added to the price: But however trifling it appears on the pint, it is 1⅓ of a penny on the gal∣lon, and on a barrel of 36 <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>chester mea∣sure, or twelve Scots gallons, is 16 d. which is the exact duty of excise on small beer, and consequently <HI>small beer in Scotland,</HI> pays exactly double duty of what it is charged with in England. It is in this way (say the trifling denomination of the tax) that the iniquity and oppression of it has escaped the notice of the legislature and all good citizens. And unless the inhabitants at large pay the tax, where is the equity of charging a few individuals as much as all the in∣habitants besides, for the ornamenting of any town
<PB N="14" REF="14"/>whatever. And what is more extraordinary, per∣haps those very people who pay this oppressive tax, do not reside within the precincts of the town, as is the case in many places having an impost. In short, every view you take of this tax, it is fraught with absurdity.</P>
<P>It is much to the honour of this country at the present period, that a spirit of patriotism prevails among the Noblemen and Gentlemen, to promote the manufactures of their own country, which if followed out with steadiness and perseverance will raise this country to a degree of opulence unknown to former ages. It is therefore from them we are to expect <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>pport in opposition to all our oppressions, and as there never was at any period, a Prime Minister, who seemed to be more the friend of the manufacturer, or lower class of the people, we have every reason to expect, that he will oppose attempts, that are prejudicial to them in any shape, provided the representatives in parliament from Scotland, show a truly spirited zeal for the public welfare. It is to them we have to look for redress, and as they are mostly men of patriotic principles, we cannot entertain a doubt, but they will be the
<PB N="15" REF="15"/>guardians of our interest. The author, in the firm persuasion that the Legislature and Public at large, will unite in redressing the evil complained of,</P>
