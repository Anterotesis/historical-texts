<P>TOM JONES, A COMIC OPERA: As it is Performed at the THEATRE-ROYAL IN COVENT-GARDEN.</P>
<P>By JOSEPH REED.</P>
<P>THE SECOND EDITION.</P>
<P>LONDON, Printed for BECKET and DE HONDT, in the Strand; and RICHARDSON and URQUHART, at the Royal Exchange.</P>
<P>MDCCLXIX.</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>IT is needless to say the following Opera is taken from FIELDING'S celebrated novel of <HI>Tom Jones;</HI> a production so replete with wit, hu∣mour, and character, that it can never want ad∣mirers while the English language remains. My extreme veneration for the memory of the truly-witty and ingenious novelist, naturally led me to <HI>preserve</HI> as much of FIELDING throughout my Opera, as the nature of my plan would allow. Nay, when it was thought necessary to shorten the piece, lest it should be too long in representation, I readily <HI>parted with my own,</HI> to <HI>retain</HI> as much as possible of the <HI>invaluable Original.</HI></P>
<P>I have made many material deviations from the novel, both in point of fable, and character. I have stripp'd its hero of his libertinism, to render him, as I imagined, more amiable and interesting; and have metamorphos'd Parson <HI>Supple</HI> into a country 'squire, to avoid giving offence to the <HI>cloth.</HI> The characters of <HI>Western</HI> and <HI>Honour</HI> I have divested of their provinciality; lest the at∣tention of the performers, to the pronunciation of an uncouth and difficult dialect, should produce an <HI>Inattention</HI> to the more material business of the drama. I have also endeavoured to purge Wes∣tern's character of its coarseness and indelicacy, in conformity to the refined taste of the present age; and of its Jacobitism, from an opinion that such political sect no longer exists, as well as from
<PB REF="4"/>a conviction that nothing of party should ever ap∣pear within the walls of a theatre.</P>
<P>While I was writing the last act of this Opera (which was in June, 1765), the <HI>French</HI> Tom Jones fell into my hands. I found its plan so very confined, and so materially different from mine, that I could reap little or no benefit from it. The only particulars, of which I have availed my∣self from Mons. POINSINET, are the hint of <HI>legi∣timating</HI> Jones, and the thought, which gave rise to my <HI>second</HI> air. I have quoted the lines, from which I received advantage in the latter instance:</P>
<Q><L>Que les devoirs que tu m'imposes,</L>
<L>Triste raison, ont de rigueur!</L>
<L>Tu gémis, Sophie, &amp; tu n'oses</L>
<L>T'interroger sur ta douleur.</L>
<L><HI>Quand sous tes doigts naissent les roses,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Les epines sont dans ton coeur.</HI></L></Q>

<SPEAKER>Hon.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'm sorry, ma'am, to see you look so grave this afternoon. I'm afraid Mr. Jones runs in your head.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>So.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. Jones runs in my head! What is Mr. Jones to me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hon.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nothing, ma'am. He's not a proper match for you to be sure: with your fortune you may command one of the greatest lords of the land; therefore you won't cer∣tainly stoop to marry a beggar and a foundling.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>So.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't know what you mean by taking these li∣berties with Mr. Jones! The misfortune of his birth is not his crime.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hon.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ma'am, if it was a disgrace, Mr. Jones has a great many people, that carry their heads very high, to keep him in countenance—well, he's one of the sweetest gentlemen that ever trod on shoe-leather! Every body likes him: all the neighbourhood, for five miles round, would run through fire and water for him—if I were in your cloaths, and he loved me, as much as I believe he loves you—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>So.</SPEAKER>
<P>Loves me, Honour! I don't understand you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hon.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ma'am, I may be mistaken, it's true; because, as the man says, we can be sure of nothing in this world but death and taxes: however I could tell you something, that looks very like it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>So.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay! pray what's that, Honour?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hon.</SPEAKER>
<P>He came into the room, as I was sitting at work, and what should be upon the table but the muff you gave me, and my gentleman whips his hands into it. "La, Mr. Jones, you'll spoil it," says I; but he still kept his hands in it, and kiss'd it, and mumbled it, and kiss'd it—for my part I never saw such kisses in my life as he gave it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>So.</SPEAKER>
<P>When was this?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hon.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let me see—it was the day after I dreamt that I was married to Sir Timothy Tipple—last Thursday—ay it was on Thursday.—But that is not all neither—yesterday, as you were playing on the harpsichord, he was in the next room, and look'd melancholly—says I, "What's the matter, Mr.
<PB N="4" REF="10"/>Jones? A penny for your thoughts"—"Hussy," says he, starting up as from a dream, "what can I be thinking of, when that angel your mistress is playing?"—But I'm afraid you're offended, ma'am?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>So.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no—proceed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hon.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then squeezing my hand—he squeez'd so hard, that I thought he would have forc'd the blood out of my finger-ends—"Oh! Mrs. Honour, says he, how happy will that man be"—and then he sigh'd—Upon my faith his breath is as sweet as a nosegay—but for heaven's sake, ma'am, don't speak of this; for he gave me a guinea never to mention it. However, as I did not swear it, it's only a promise, and what signifies a promise?</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hon.</SPEAKER>
<P>Harm, ma'am? I'm positive sure he meant no harm—"Yes, Honour, says he, I'm neither such a coxcomb, nor such a villian, as to look upon her in any other light, but as my goddess; and as such I will always worship and adore her while I have breath"—this was all, ma'am; so you plainly see he meant no harm.</P>

<P>Brother, I must compliment you on the in∣crease of your understanding; for this is positively the most sensible expression that ever escaped you—I will dis∣claim all knowledge of the world, if the person, my niece, hath chosen, be not the very person you would chuse for her.</P>

<P>Nay, e'en find that out your self. You who are so profound a politician—in your own opinion—can be at no great loss. That judgment, which can penetrate into the cabinets of princes, and discern the secret springs, which move the state-wheels in all the political machines in Europe, can surely very easily find out what passes in the rude, uninform'd mind of a girl.</P>

<P>Sister, don't talk your court-gibberish to me: I don't understand the lingo; and moreover, and besides, you know, I hate every thing that belongs to the court.

<P>DEAR Nightingale, you should have consider'd her want of fortune sooner. On promise of marriage, you have won her to elope from a tender mo∣ther. You have made use of every effort to seduce her, and because you cannot succeed, you want to shuffle her off. The girl is absolutely ruined; for should she even return home immediately, it would be impossible to con∣vince the world of her innocence.</P>
