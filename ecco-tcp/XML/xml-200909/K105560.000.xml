<P>RIMES.</P>
<P>PINGO MIHI ET ARTI.</P>
<P>LONDON. PRINTED FOR CHARLES DILLY.</P>
<P>M DCC LXXXI.</P>

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN such of the ODES in this publication as extend to greater length were composed, it was observed, that whatever art might be used to diversify the cadence, there was still somewhat wanting to the delight of the ear. This defect was perceived to be chiefly owing to uniformity of stanza, which protracted to any degree, must ever fatigue, as extinguishing the great source of all pleasure, variety.</P>
<P>To remedy this, a particular series of stanzas was adopted; in which the two first correspond, and are succeeded by a third of as different a measure as might be. This was thought to answer every intention proposed; and appearing to present as per∣fect a succession of sounds as rime would admit, was called by way of eminence, MELODY.</P>
<P>It was not till this plan was chosen, after trying most modifications that rime could allow, that it
<PB REF="3"/>was considered that the very model of Pindar was followed. Such authority added to the author's confidence in the perfection of his method, but de∣tracted much from the pride of invention, by recal∣ling to his memory the real truth, which was, that he had only revived the ancient term, MELOS.</P>
<P>Mr. Congreve has long since observed, in his dis∣course on the Pindaric ode, that the use of the STROPHE, ANTISTROPHE, and EPODE is obsolete and impertinent. But such is the superstition for Antiquity that they are retained to this day, tho' even their ancient use and origin cannot be ascer∣tained. That, as they are commonly used, they confine the spirit of the greater modern Ode, with∣out adding to its melody must be confessed. Yet they must be retained, because they give it regularity! This is the only reason of most modern poets for retaining them. They seldom appear to have ob∣served, that in a long or grand production of the lyric kind, the admission of a similar variety would contribute not a little to the riches of poetry.</P>
<P>To have their full effect the Strophe, Antistrophe, and Epode, or as they are here denominated, the CADENCE, ANTIPHONY, and UNISON, must have the property, either of distinct harmony, or brevity. Every one must have observed that in the more ele∣gant
<PB REF="4"/>French and Italian odes, there are two distinct parts in every stanza. These, like the parts of a Scots tune, vary the measure and contribute exceed∣ingly to entertain the ear. For example in this stanza of Malherbe,
<Q><L>C'est en la paix que toutes choses</L>
<L>Succédent selon nos desirs:</L>
<L>Comme au Printems naissent les roses,</L>
<L>En la paix naissent les plaisirs.</L>
<L>Elle met les pompes aux villes;</L>
<L>Donne aux chams les moissons fertilles;</L>
<L>Et de la majesté des loix</L>
<L>Appuyant les pouvoirs supremes,</L>
<L>Fait demeurer les diademes</L>
<L>Fermes sur la teste des Rois.</L></Q> the first four lines are of a melody distinct from the six last. This plan was well followed by Mr. Gray in his odes on the Spring, and Eton College. And that he was very sensible of this beauty appears from his observation inserted among the Notes on Mr. Mason's edition of his Poems. "There is," says he, <Q>a <HI>tout ensemble</HI> of sound as well as of sense in poetical composition always necessary to its per∣fection. What is gone before, still dwells upon the ear, and insensibly harmonizes with the pre∣sent line, as in that succession of fleeting notes
<PB REF="5"/>which is called melody.</Q> So much for distinct∣ness of harmony; as to brevity the other requisite, its effect is obvious.</P>
<P>From these observations the reader will expect that the author has paid a particular regard to his num∣bers. He has so. He always considered harmony as the chief perfection of the ode. Music was in∣deed the first companion of lyric poetry: and at this day, who would not prefer a careless production of Dryden, tho' void of every excellence but harmony, to the most laboured of Cowley, tho' rendered heavy with the very gold of fancy?</P>
<P>To the Melodies in this Collection succeed ano∣ther species of lyric poetry here called SYMPHONIES. By which name it is to be understood, that the stanza is varied throughout, as the subject seemed to de∣mand an answering mode.</P>
<P>Dithyrambic Odes, On Enthusiasm, and To Laughter, were likewise prepared, but are not here given, as there was no occasion to swell the Collec∣tion, till the opinion of the public respecting its merit should be known.</P>

<L>The rose that to the summer ray</L>
<L>But half her blushing beauties dares display,</L>
<L>So sweetly never smiled;</L>
<L>The jocund Spring, when from her fragrant bed</L>
<L>She comes the genial Hours to lead,</L>
<L>As Fancy's sacred child;</L>
<L>When now the happy hand of Time</L>
<L>Gave every rising grace to view;</L>

<L>The mountain's front to tread,</L>
<L>With solitary step to dally</L>
<L>Thro' each wild and haunted valley,</L>
<L>Thro' each grove of sable shade,</L>
<L>Were her delights. There by some stream</L>
<L>She gathered flowers of every beam</L>
<L>The flowing honours of her head to crown;</L>
<L>Or, on a velvet bank at ease reclined,</L>
<L>She caught the notes that by the vernal wind</L>
<L>Were from the wood in floating measures blown.</L>

<HEAD>CADENCE II.</HEAD>
<L>Taught by the warbling race of air,</L>

<L>O happy age! when known no toil</L>
<L>Save to obtain some haughty damsel's smile;</L>
<L>And feed the fleecy flock.</L>
<L>The fruits a feast of sprightly relish gave,</L>
<L>With beverage from the orient wave</L>
<L>And honey from the rock.</L>
<L>O happy age! when shapes of light,</L>

<L>To dwell with man their radiant flight</L>
<L>Would hasten from the friendly sky.</L>

<HEAD>ANTIPHONY III.</HEAD>
<L>The Gales their gentle aid applied,</L>
<L>Along the tide the painted galley hied,</L>
<L>That spred a shining plain:</L>
<L>And soon, emergent from the western skies,</L>
<L>They saw the verdant groves arise</L>
<L>That crowned the gay domain.</L>
<L>A cloud of breathing incense sweet</L>
<L>To slumber soothed the ambient main:</L>

<L>Shone on the strand a wanton train.</L>

<L>To Pleasure's dome they came.</L>

<L>To the sun's meridian flame.</L>
<L>There on a couch with fragrance spread</L>
<L>The Queen and young Desire were laid,</L>

<L>The Empress with a winning smile</L>

<HEAD>ANTIPHONY IV.</HEAD>
<L>Tho' he of Thebes informed thy frame</L>

<L>O'er hill and shade and florid field</L>
<L>And balmy sky serene;</L>
<L>Where, rising slow with rapturous swell,</L>

<HEAD>UNISON IV.</HEAD>
<L>Here long the enamoured maid,</L>

<L>Exploring now the lawn's amel,</L>

<L>Her hidden recess found.</L>

<HEAD>ANTIPHONY VI.</HEAD>
<L>Obscure amid a winding glade,</L>

<L>Arose a rocky cave;</L>

<HEAD>ODE XVI. THE GHOST OF AZO.</HEAD>
<P>In the style of the Provenzal Heroic Romanze.</P>
<LG>
<L>'STRIKE the shell,' said the hero hoar,</L>
<L>Sudden ceased the banquet's roar;</L>
<L>The merry minstrels fire the string,</L>
<L>Azo's hapless doom they sing,</L>
<L>By their lord in conslict slain;</L>
<L>Faded flower of Aquitain,</L>
<L>Faded in life's rosy spring!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>On his arm of might reclined,</L>
<L>Winding in his pensive mind</L>
<L>His deeds of grace and deeds of hate,</L>
<L>The awful power of Rodolph sate.</L>
<L>His knights and minions all around</L>
<L>Fondly quaffed the extatic sound,</L>
<L>Nor heard the approaching peal of fate.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The lamps burn blue,' pale Oric cried,</L>
<L>And threw his glittering harp aside;</L>
<L>The glittering harp with dismal breath<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It was an old superstition, that on the eve of any calamity, the musical instruments gave a melancholy sound.</NOTE></L>
<L>Wailed to the leaden hand of Death!</L>
<L>'Ha! No bidden guest art thou!'</L>
<L>The potent screamed with frantic brow,</L>
<L>Mien of fear, and eyes of wrath.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="127" REF="131"/>
<L>O'er each knight and tinseled minion</L>
<L>Horror spread her sable pinion,</L>
<L>As the visionary shade</L>
<L>The terrors of his spell displayed.</L>
<L>'Hark, hark! The echoing vallies groan</L>
<L>'Beneath the powers that shield my son</L>
<L>'In horrent pomp and steel arrayed.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'On my dim ear from afar</L>
<L>'Yells the thunder of the war.</L>
<L>'Evil scath thee, lord of blood!</L>
<L>'Vengeance in her purple flood</L>
<L>'Thee and thy many soon shall sweep,</L>
<L>'Like me to dwell with Night and Sleep</L>
<L>'And Misery's funereal brood!'</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Draws the peer his flaming brand,</L>
<L>His trembling train around him stand,</L>
<L>As all appalled with ghastly glare</L>
<L>He idly dares the fleeting air.</L>
<L>'To horse! To horse!' a menial cries,</L>
<L>'Rollo's hundred banners rise</L>
<L>'Blazing o'er the mountain bare.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'Glory calls. Away!' In vain!</L>
<L>The morrow o'er thy desert reign</L>
<L>Saw Ruin stretch his dreary shade.</L>
<L>Slaughter mailed, and meagre Dread,</L>
<L>Penury and Sorrow there,</L>
<L>Famine gaunt, and grim Despair,</L>
<L>To Death, their lord, dire homage paid.</L>

<HEAD>SONNET I. ON THE PROGRESS OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>WHEN first the infant left the Saxon shore</L>
<L>Rude was her voice and homely her array,</L>
<L>Till Chaucer to the wanton court her bore,</L>
<L>Where jests and wiles she learned and amorous play.</L>
<L>Then Spenser's cell the damsel did explore,</L>
<L>Who decked her locks with Latian flowrets gay;</L>
<L>And taught to chaunt the visionary lay,</L>
<L>With Fancy's treasures fraught and Wisdom's lore.</L>
<L>What dreams of transport soothed her youthful breast</L>
<L>When Shakespear led her to the impassioned scene!</L>
<L>She hoped no more: till in her Milton blest,</L>
<L>Who strength and beauty gave her to convene,</L>
<L>In heavenly arms and heavenly splendor drest,</L>
<L>She rose a cherub thro' the blue serene.</L>

<HEAD>SONNET II.</HEAD>
<L>TRUE: she was fair as Fancy's fairest child.</L>
<L>True: much her thought excelled her early years,</L>
<L>True: nameless grace in every gesture smiled.</L>
<L>True: she was good above her gentlest peers.</L>
<L>Yet cease my soul: O be no more beguiled!</L>
<L>Yet cease to dream her bright form still appears.</L>
<L>Yet cease to dream her voice still charms my ears.</L>
<L>Yet cease to paint her sweet demeanor mild.</L>
<L>For why? The sod is green that clothes her grave!</L>
<L>(Oh would to heaven that grave me rather knew!)</L>
<L>From sighs or tears no ease can sorrow have:—</L>
<L>From sighs or tears can no relief accrue?</L>
<L>And is she gone beyond all power to save?</L>
<L>Then, Death, thou only can'st give respite due!</L>

<HEAD>SONNET III. TO HOPE.</HEAD>
<L>AS in the winding road of life we stray,</L>
<L>With scenes of joy beset and scenes of care,</L>
<L>Wisdom may guide, but cannot deck our way,</L>
<L>Her chosen mandate ever was 'Beware.'</L>
<L>Her beams but tend our dangers to display,</L>
<L>And warn our lingering step from Pleasure's snare;</L>
<L>Like the sepulchral Lamp whose dismal glare</L>
<L>But serves with sights of sorrow to affray.</L>
<L>Yet, Hope, dear Goddess! thy enchanting sway</L>
<L>Awakes the soul to other objects fair:</L>
<L>O ever let thy favourable ray</L>
<L>Exile the fatal shadows of Despair;</L>
<L>To thy bright paradise my mind convey,</L>
<L>And prospects large of future bliss declare.</L>

<L>THIS shade that never saw the sun's bright beam,</L>
<L>Tho' sent from his meridian mansion high,</L>
<L>Where verdant myrtles rear their state supreme</L>
<L>O'er flowers of richest smell and richest dye,</L>
<L><PB N="135" REF="137"/>Thro' violet banks devolves a warbling stream,</L>
<L>That shows each lucid pebble to the eye,</L>
<L>As thro' the crystal we the rose descry,</L>
<L>Not hid, but shining with more radiant gleam,</L>
<L>A pensive swain (nought else he can bestow)</L>
<L>With reverend honour consecrates to thee,</L>
<L>O Sleep, from whom sole ease the wretched find.</L>
<L>Here then let all thy blessed influence flow,</L>
<L>From Sorrow's chain his captive fancy free,</L>
<L>And sooth with lenient dreams his weary mind.</L>

<HEAD>SONNET V. THE TOMB OF PETRARCH.</HEAD>
<P>From the Italian of Benedetto Varchi.</P>
<L>YE venerable marbles that inclose</L>
<L>The reliques of the lord of Tuscan song,</L>
<L>To whom in ages past no equal rose,</L>
<L>Nor shall, I deem, all future bards among;</L>
<L>For that to me the blessed powers expose</L>
<L>No gift that to his worth might well belong,</L>
<L>No part of rich Arabia's fragrant throng</L>
<L>Of herbs or gums, my worship to disclose;</L>
<L>Despise not ye, that, modest tho' of skill,</L>
<L>To you my reverential vows I scan.</L>
<L>So spoke the swain, as with the Spring's best bloom</L>
<L>Of odorous flowers he strewed the honoured tomb;</L>
<L>While thro' the circling hills soft voices ran,</L>
<L>'Tho' poor thy gift, O shepherd, rich thy will!'</L>
