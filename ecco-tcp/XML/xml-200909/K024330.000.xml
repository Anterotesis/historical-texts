<SPEAKER>Rup.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thus have I an extempore Comedy in my house, nature not only
 supplying me with matter but scenes and decorations, and here comes a
 principal cha∣racter, an Englishman, who traces his origin from the Saxon
 Heptarchy, prodigal of pleasure as Henry the 5th with his mad associates,
 and estimable as that exemplary prince after he had renounced his
 extravagancies. Ha! English, the honour of a visit from you is as kind as
 it is unexpected.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eng.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, faith, 'tis a satisfaction I should give my∣self
 oftner, but our pursuits are different, and why should we meet to
 disagree?—I am bound by a singular though indulgent father—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rup.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know it—his dying injunctions were, that you should
 never see London, that you should dine four times a year with the vestry,
 hang a stag's horns in your hall, brew your own October, and roast an ox at
 Christ∣mas. Mine, I thank him, enjoin'd me no such con∣duct—he went
 abroad—accumulated a large fortune—died—and left me to
 spend it.</P>

 breaks down in a quagmire, occa∣sioned by the late floods, and I invite my
 lord and his suite to my house.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eng.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, and a stage-coach, in about a quarter of an hour after
 breaks down in the same quagmire, in which are a venerable old man and his
 lovely daughter, whose appear∣ance being less splendid than my lord's,
 they are left to shift for themselves.</P>

<P>Oh! they are safe at Seabright's, my steward.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eng.</SPEAKER>
<P>No thanks to you—I saw them there this
 morn∣ing—they are lately arrived from India, and their busi∣ness it
 seems no less concerns you than themselves.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rup.</SPEAKER>
<P>And they have chosen you, I suppose, for their
 advocate—their cause will have weight in such able hands. Will you
 dine here? Believe me, I long to cultivate the closest intimacy with
 you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eng.</SPEAKER>
<P>Try the test, which life is the most rational, and I accept,
 this gage of friendship—I'll dine with you, and you and your friends
 shall sup with me, and if before we part, you do not confess my conduct
 to be more reasonable than your's, I'll change my ground and be∣come as
 errant a votary of dissipation as you or the mad∣dest of your

<P>What would you say of her, Sir?</P>

<P>That she is miserable, and you have made her so; that you
 have stolen her heart, and I fear her honor.</P>

<SPEAKER>Rup.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's very well faith, I did not expect this—what!
 man—are not you and I young, high-blooded? will you make me believe,
 while your companions have been beating the bushes of a morning, you have
 never stolen away to the arms of some cherry-cheeked farmer's daughter?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eng.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, I am incapable of the crime you insinuate; a true
 English sportsman holds his tenants comfort and security as inviolate

<P>Well well, we must endeavour to cure them; he believes me to
 be dead, and his sister in India, he has forgot her of course; and as for
 me, I have nothing to do but keep aloof till our plot is wrought to its height;
 but what gives me the greatest pleasure in this business is, that the
 son of my old friend Hengist English will join our designs against my
 son. I remember his father and I talked of him and my Aurelia when they were
 little ones; I should not be sorry to revive the idea.</P>

<P>Well, well, we'll make my boy the idol of the county too. We,

 his princely fortune, his elegant connections.</P>
