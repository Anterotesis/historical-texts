<HEAD><PB REF="4"/>AN HISTORY OF ANIMALS.</HEAD>
<DIV1 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. I. Of Ruminating Animals.</HEAD>
<P>OF all animals, those that chew the cud are the most harmless,
and the most easily tamed. As they live entirely upon vegetables, it is
neither their interest nor their pleasure to make war upon the rest of
the brute creation; content with the pastures where they are placed, they
seldom desire to change, while they are furnished with a proper supply;
and fearing nothing from each other, they generally go in herds for their
mutual security. All the fiercest of the carnivorous kinds seek their
food <PB N="2" REF="5"/> in gloomy solitude; these, on the contrary, range
together; the very meanest of them are found to unite in each other's
defence; and the hare itself is a gregarious animal, in those countries
where it has no other enemies but the beasts of the forest to guard
against.</P>
<P>As the food of ruminant animals is entirely of the vegetable kind,
and as this is very easily procured, so these animals seem naturally
more indolent and less artful than those of the carnivo∣rous kinds; and as
their appetites are more simple, their instincts seem to be less
capable of variation. The fox or the wolf are for ever prowling; their long
habits of want give them a degree of sharpness and cunning; their life is a
con∣tinued scene of stratagem and escape: but the patient ox, or the
deer, enjoy the repast that Nature has abundantly provided; certain of
subsistence, and content with security.</P>
<P>As Nature has furnished these animals with an appetite for
such coarse and simple nutri∣ment, so she has enlarged the capacity
of the intestines, to take in a greater supply. In the carnivorous kinds,
as their food is nourishing and juicy, their stomachs are but small, and
their intestines short; but in these, whose pasture is coarse, and
where much must be ac∣cumulated before any quantity of nourishment 
<PB N="3" REF="6"/> can be obtained, their stomachs are large and numerous,
and their intestines long and mus∣cular. The bowels of a ruminating animal
may be considered as an elaboratory, with vessels in it, fitted for
various transmutations. It requires a long and tedious process before
grass can be transmuted into flesh; and for this purpose, Nature, in
general, has furnished such animals as feed upon grass, with four
stomachs, through which the food successively passes, and undergoes
the proper separations.</P>
<P>Of the four stomachs with which ruminant animals are furnished,
the first is called the paunch, which receives the food after it has been
slightly chewed; the second is called the honeycomb, and is properly
nothing more than a continuation of the former; these two, which are very
capacious, the animal fills as fast as it can, and then lies down to
ruminate, which may be properly considered as a kind of vo∣miting without
effort or pain. The two sto∣machs abovementioned being filled with as much as
they can contain, and the grass, which was slightly chewed, beginning to
swell with the heat of the situation, it dilates the stomachs, and
these again contract upon their contents. The aliment, thus squeezed, has
but two pas∣sages to escape at; one into the third stomach, 
<PB N="4" REF="7"/> which is very narrow; and the other back, by the gullet,
into the mouth, which is wider. The greatest quantity, therefore, is driven
back through the largest aperture into the mouth, to be chewed a second
time; while a small part, and that only the most liquid, is driven into the
third stomach, through the orifice which is so small. The food which is
driven to the mouth, and chewed a second time, is thus ren∣dered more soft
and moist, and becomes at last liquid enough to pass into the conduit
that goes to the third stomach, where it undergoes a still farther
comminution. In this stomach, which is called the manyfold, from the number
of its leaves, all which tend to promote digestion, the grass has the
appearance of boiled spinage, but not yet sufficiently reduced, so as to
make a part of the animal's nourishment: it re∣quires the operation of the
fourth stomach for this purpose, where it undergoes a complete maceration,
and is separated to be turned into chyle.</P>
<P>But Nature has not been less careful in another respect, in
fitting the intestines of these animals for their food. In the carnivorous
kinds they are thin and lean; but in ruminating animals they are strong,
fleshy, and well covered with fat. Every precaution seems taken that 
<PB N="5" REF="8"/> can help their digestion: their stomach is strong and
muscular, the more readily to act upon its contents; their intestines are
lined with fat, the better to preserve their warmth; and they are extended to
a much greater length, so as to extract every part of that nourishment
which their vegetable food so scantily supplies.</P>
<P>In this manner are all quadrupedes of the cow, the sheep, or the
deer kind, seen to ru∣minate; being thus furnished with four sto∣machs,
for the macerating of their food. These, therefore, may most properly be
called the ru∣minant kinds; although there are many others that have this
quality in a less observable de∣gree. The rhinoceros, the camel, the
horse, the rabbit, the marmotte, and the squirrel, all chew the cud by
intervals, although they are not furnished with stomachs like the former.
But not these alone, there are numberless other ani∣mals that appear to
ruminate; not only birds, but fishes, and insects. Among birds are the
pelican, the stork, the heron, the pidgeon, and the turtle; these have a
power of disgorging their food to feed their young. Among fishes are
lobsters, crabs, and that fish called the do∣rado. The salmon also is
said to be of this number: and, if we may believe Ovid, the <PB N="6" REF="9"/> scarus likewise; of which he says<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"> 
<Q> 
<L>At contra herbosa pisces laxantur arena,</L> 
<L>Ut scarus epastas solus qui ruminat
escas.</L></Q></NOTE>: 
<Q> 
<L>Of all the fish that graze beneath the flood,</L> 
<L>He only ruminates his former food.</L></Q> Of insects, the
ruminating tribe is still larger: the mole, the cricket, the wasp, the
drone, the bee, the grashopper, and the beetle. All these animals either
actually chew the cud, or seem at least to ruminate. They have the
stomach composed of muscular fibres, by means whereof the food is ground
up and down, in the same manner as in those which are particularly
di∣stinguished by the appellation of ruminants.</P>
<P>But not these alone; men themselves have been often known to
ruminate, and some even with pleasure. The accounts of these calamities,
for such I must consider them, in∣cident to our fellow-creatures, are not
very plea∣sant to read; yet I must transcribe a short one, as given us
by Slare, in the Philosophical Transactions, as it may in some measure
shew the satisfaction which the lower tribes of ani∣mals enjoy while they
ruminate. The man in question was a citizen of Bristol, of about twenty
years of age, and, what seemed more extraordinary still, of a ruminating
family, for <PB N="7" REF="10"/> his father was frequently subject to the
same infirmity, or amusement, as he himself perhaps would call it. This
young man usually began to chew his meat over again within about a quarter of
an hour after eating. His ruminating after a full meal generally lasted about
an hour and an half; nor could he sleep until this task was performed. The
victuals, upon the re∣turn, tasted even more pleasantly than at first;
and returned as if they had been beaten up in a mortar. If he ate a variety of
things, that which he ate first came up again first; and if this return was
interrupted for any time, it pro∣duced sickness and disorder, and he was
never well till it returned. Instances of this kind, however, are rare and
accidental; and it is happy for mankind that they are so. Of all other
animals, we spend the least time in eating; this is one of the great
distinctions between us and the brute creation; and eating is a pleasure of
so low a kind, that none but such as are nearly allied to the quadrupede,
desire its prolon∣gation.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="2" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="8" REF="11"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. II. Of Quadrupedes of the Cow Kind.</HEAD>
<P>OF all ruminant animals, those of the cow kind deserve the
first rank, both for their size, their beauty, and their services. The
horse is more properly an animal belonging to the rich; the sheep chiefly
thrives in a flock, and requires attendance; but the cow is more especially
the poor man's pride, his riches, and his support. There are many of our
peasantry that have no other possession but a cow; and even of the
ad∣vantages resulting from this most useful crea∣ture, the poor are but
the nominal possessors. Its flesh they cannot pretend to taste,
since then their whole riches are at once destroyed; its calf they are
obliged to fatten for sale, since veal is a delicacy they could not make
any pretensions to; its very milk is wrought into butter and cheese for the
tables of their masters; while they have no share even in their own
possession, but the choice of their market. I cannot bear to hear the
rich crying out for li∣berty, while they thus starve their fellow crea∣tures,
and feed them up with an imaginary good, while they monopolize the real
benefits of nature.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="12"/>In those countries where the men are under
better subordination, this excellent animal is of more general advantage. In
Germany, Poland, and Switzerland, every peasant keeps two or three cows, not
for the benefit of his master, but for himself. The meanest of the
peasants there kills one cow at least for his own table, which he salts
and hangs up, and thus preserves as a de∣licacy all the year round. There is
scarce a cottage in those countries that is not hung round with these
marks of hospitality; and which often make the owner better contented with
hunger, since he has it in his power to be luxurious when he thinks proper. A
piece of beef hung up there, is considered as an elegant piece of furniture,
which, though seldom touched, at least argues the possessor's
opulence and ease. But it is very different, for some years past, in this
country, where our lower rustics at least are utterly unable to purchase
meat any part of the year, and by them even butter is considered as an
article of extravagance.</P>
<P>The climate and pasture of Great Britain, however, is excellently
adapted to this animal's moderate nature; and the verdure and the fer∣tility of
our plains are perfectly suited to the manner of its feeding; for wanting the
upper fore teeth, it loves to graze in an high rich <PB N="10" REF="13"/>
pasture. This animal seems but little regardful of the quality of its food,
provided it be sup∣plied in sufficient abundance; it makes no par∣ticular
distinctions in the choice of its herbage, but indiscriminately and
hastily devours the proper quantity. For this reason, in our pastures,
where the grass is rather high than succulent, more flourishing than
nutritious, the cow thrives admirably; and there is no part of Europe where the
tame animal grows so large, yields more milk, or more readily fattens, than
with us.</P>
<P>Our pastures supply them with abundance, and they in return
enrich the pasture; for, of all animals, the cow seems to give back more
than it takes from the soil. The horse and the sheep are known, in a
course of years, to impo∣verish the ground. The land where they have fed
becomes weedy, and the vegetables coarse and unpalatable: on the contrary,
the pasture where the cow has been bred, acquires a finer softer surface,
and becomes every year more beautiful and even. The reason is, that the
horse being furnished with fore teeth in the upper jaw, nips the grass
closely, and, therefore, only chuses that which is the most delicate and
ten∣der; the sheep also, though, with respect to its teeth, formed like
the cow, only bites the most <PB N="11" REF="14"/> succulent parts of the
herbage: these animals, therefore, leave all the high weeds standing; and
while they cut the finer grass too closely, suffer the ranker herbage to
vegetate and over∣run the pasture. But it is otherwise with the cow; as its
teeth cannot come so close to the ground as those of the horse, nor
so readily as those of the sheep, which are less, it is obliged to feed
upon the tallest vegetables that offer; thus it eats them all down, and, in
time, levels the surface of the pasture.</P>
<P>The age of the cow is known by the teeth and horns. This animal is
furnished with eight cutting teeth in the lower jaw; at the age of ten
months, the two middlemost of these fall out, and are replaced by others,
that are not so white, but broader; at the age of sixteen months, the two
next milk-white teeth fall out likewise, and others come up in their room:
thus, at the end of every six months, the creature loses and gains, till,
at the age of three years, all the cutting teeth are renewed, and then they are
long, pretty white and equal; but in proportion as the animal ad∣vances in
years, they become irregular and black, their inequalities become smoother,
and the animal less capable of chewing its food. Thus the cow often declines
from this single cause; for as it is obliged to eat <PB N="12" REF="15"/> a
great deal to support life, and as the smooth∣ness of the teeth makes the
difficulty of chewing great, a sufficient quantity of food cannot be
supplied to the stomach. Thus the poor animal sinks in the midst of
plenty, and every year grows leaner and leaner, till it dies.</P>
<P>The horns are another, and a surer method of determining this
animal's age. At three years old, it sheds its horns, and new ones arise in
their place, which continue as long as it lives; at four years of age, the cow
has small pointed neat smooth horns, thickest near the head; at five the
horns become larger, and are marked round with the former year's growth. Thus,
while the animal continues to live, the horns continue to lengthen; and every
year a new ring is added at the root; so that allowing three years before
their appearance, and then reckoning the number of rings, we have in both
together the animal's age exactly.</P>
<P>As we have indisputably the best breed of horned cattle of any
in Europe, so it was not without the same assiduity that we came to
excel in these, as in our horses. The breed of cows has been entirely
improved by a foreign mix∣ture, properly adapted to supply the imper∣fections
of our own. Such as are purely British, <PB N="13" REF="16"/> are far inferior
in size to those on many parts of the continent; but those which we have
thus improved, by far excel all others. Our Lincoln∣shire kind derive their
size from the Holstein breed: and the large hornless cattle that are bred
in some parts of England, came originally from Poland. We were once famous
for a wild breed of these animals, but these have long since been worn
out; and perhaps no kingdom in Europe can furnish so few wild animals of
all kinds, as our own. Cultivation and agri∣culture are sure to banish
these, wherever they are found; and every addition a country re∣ceives from
art, drives away those animals that are only, fitted for a state of
nature.</P>
<P>Of all quadrupedes, the cow seems most liable to alteration from
its pasture. In the dif∣ferent parts of our own country, we easily
per∣ceive the great varieties produced among these animals, by the richness
or poverty of the soil. In some they grow to a great bulk; and I have
seen an ox sixteen hands high, which is taller than the general run of our
horses. In others, they appear as diminutive; being not so large as an
ass. The breed of the Isle of Man, and most parts of Scotland, is much
less in ge∣neral than in England or Ireland: they are differently shaped
also, the dewlap being much <PB N="14" REF="17"/> smaller, and, as the
expression is, the beast has more of the ewe neck. This, till some
years ago, was considered in cattle as a defor∣mity; and the cow was
chosen, according to Virgil's direction, with a large dewlap: how∣ever, at
present it is the universal opinion, that the cow wants in udder what it
has in neck, and the larger the dewlap, the smaller is the quantity of its
milk. Our graziers now, therefore, endeavour to mix the two breeds; the large
Holstein with the small northern; and from both results that fine milch
breed, which excels the cattle of any other part of the world.</P>
<P>This difference, arising from pasture, is more observable in
other countries than in our own. The cow kind is to be found in almost every
part of the world, large in proportion to the richness of the pasture; and
small, as the animal is stinted in its food. Thus Africa is re∣markable for
the largest and the smallest cattle of this kind; as is also India,
Poland, Switzer∣land, and several other parts of Europe. Among the Eluth
Tartars, where the pastures are re∣markably rich and nourishing, the cow
be∣comes so large, that he must be a tall man who can reach the tip of its
shoulder. On the con∣trary, in France, where the animal is stinted in 
<PB N="15" REF="18"/> its food, and driven from the most flourishing
pastures, it greatly degenerates.</P>
<P>But the differences in the size of this animal are not so
remarkable as those which are found in its form, its hair, and its horns. The
differ∣ence is so very extraordinary in many of them, that they have been
even considered as a dif∣ferent kind of creature, and names have been given
them as a distinct species, when in reality they are all the same<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon, vol. xxiii. p. 78.</BIBL></NOTE>. In this
manner the urus and the bison have been considered, from the va∣riety in
their make, to be distinct in their pro∣duction; but they are all in fact the
descendants of one common stock, as they have that certain mark of unity,
they breed and propagate among each other. Naturalists have therefore
laboured under an obvious error, when, because of the extreme bulk of the
urus, or because of the hump upon the back of the bison, they assigned
them different places in the creation, and sepa∣rated a class of animals
which was really united. It is true, the horse and the ass do not differ
so much in form, as the cow and the bison; ne∣vertheless, the former, are
distinct animals, as their breed is marked with sterility; the latter are
animals of the same kind, as their breed is fruitful, and a race of animals
is produced, in <PB N="16" REF="19"/> which the hump belonging to the bison is
soon worn away. The differences, therefore, be∣tween the cow, the urus, and
the bison, are merely accidental. The same caprice in na∣ture that has
given horns to some cows, and denied them to others, may also have given
the bison an hump, or encreased the bulk of the urus; it may have given the
one a mane, or denied a sufficiency of hair to the other.</P>
<P>But before we proceed farther, it may be proper to describe
these varieties, which have been thus taken for distinct kinds<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This description is chiefly taken from Klein.</NOTE>. The urus,
or wild bull, is chiefly to be met with in the province of Lithuania; and grows
to a size, that scarce any other animal, except the elephant, is found to
equal. It is quite black, except a stripe mixed with white, that runs from
the neck to the tail, along the top of the back; the horns are short, thick
and strong; the eyes are fierce and fiery; the forehead is adorned with a
kind of garland of black curled hair, and some of them are found to have
beards of the same; the neck is short and strong, and the skin has an
odour of musk. The female, though not so big as the male, exceeds the
largest of our bulls in size; nevertheless, her udder and teats are so
small, that they can scarcely be <PB REF="20"/>

<HEAD>The Bison.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>De Seve del.</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Is<SUP>c</SUP>. Taylor sculp.</BYLINE>
</FIGURE> <PB N="17" REF="21"/> perceived. Upon the whole, however,
this animal resembles the tame one very exactly, except in some trifling
varieties, which his state of wildness, or the richness of the pastures
where he is found, may easily have produced.</P>
<P>The bison, which is another variety of the cow kind, differs from
the rest, in having a lump between its shoulders. These animals are of
various kinds; some very large, others as di∣minutively little. In general,
to regard this ani∣mal's fore parts, he has somewhat the look of a lion, with
a long shaggy mane, and a beard under his chin; his head is little, his eyes
red and fiery, with a furious look; the forehead is large, and the horns so
big, and so far asunder, that three men might often sit between them. On
the middle of the back there grows a bunch almost as high as that of a camel,
covered with hair, and which is considered as a great delicacy by those
that hunt him. There is no pursuing him with safety, except in forests
where there are trees large enough to hide the hunters. He is generally taken
by pit-falls; the inhabitants of those countries where he is found wild,
dig∣ing holes in the ground, and covering them over with boughs of trees and
grass; then pro∣voking the bison to pursue them, they get on the
opposite side of the pit fall, while the furious <PB REF="22"/>

<GAP DESC="duplicate" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/> <PB N="18" REF="24"/> animal,
running head foremost, falls into the pit prepared for him, and is there
quickly over∣come and slain.</P>
<P>Besides these real distinctions in the cow kind, there have
been many others made, that appear to be in name only. Thus the bonasus, of
which naturalists have given us long de∣scriptions, is supposed by
Klein and Buffon to be no more than another name for the bison, as the
descriptions given of them by the ancients coincide. The bubalus also of
the ancients, which some have supposed to belong to the cow kind, Buffon
places among the lower class of ruminant quadrupedes, as it most
resembles them in size, shape, and the figure of its horns. Of all the
varieties, therefore, of the cow kind, there are but two that are really
distinct; namely, the cow, and the buffalo: these two are separated by
nature; they seem to bear an antipathy to each other; they avoid each other,
and may be considered as much removed as the horse is from the ass or the
zebra. When, therefore, we have described the varieties of the cow kind, we
shall pass on to the buffalo, which being a different animal, requires a
separate history.</P>
<P>There is scarce a part of the world, as was said before, in
which the cow is not found in <PB N="19" REF="25"/> some one of its varieties;
either large, like the urus, or humped as the bison; with strait horns, or
bending, inverted backwards, or turning side∣ways to the cheek, like those
of the ram; and, in many countries, they are found without any horns
whatsoever. But to be more particular, beginning at the north, the few kine
which subsist in Iceland, are without horns, although of the same race
originally with ours. The size of these is rather relative to the
goodness of the pasture, than the warmth or coldness of the climate. The
Dutch frequently bring great quantities of lean cattle from Denmark, which they
fatten on their own rich grounds. These are in general of a larger size
than their own natural breed; and they fatten very easily. The cattle of the
Ukraine, where the pasture is ex∣cellent, become very fat, and are
considered as the largest breed of all Europe. In Switzer∣land, where the
mountains are covered with a rich nourishing herbage, which is entirely
re∣served for their kine, these animals grow to a very large size. On the
contrary, in France, where they get no other grass but what is thought unfit
for horses, they dwindle, and grow lean. In some parts of Spain, the cow
grows to a good size; those wild bulls, how∣ever, which they pride
themselves so much in <PB N="20" REF="26"/> combating, are a very mean
despicable little animal, and somewhat shaped like one of our cows, with
nothing of that peculiar sternness of aspect for which our bulls are
remarkable. In Barbary, and the provinces of Africa, where the ground is dry,
and the pasturage short, the cows are of a very small breed, and give
milk in proportion. On the contrary, in Ethiopia, they are of a prodigious
bigness. The same holds in Persia and Tartary; where, in some places,
they are very small, and, in others, of an amazing stature It is thus, in
almost every part of the world, this animal is found to cor∣respond in
size to the quantity of its pro∣vision.</P>
<P>If we examine the form of these animals, as they are found tame,
in different regions, we shall find, that the breed of the urus, or those
without an hump, chiefly occupies the cold and the temperate zones, and is not
so much dis∣persed towards the south. On the contrary, the breed of the
bison, or the animal with an hump, is found in all the southern parts of
the world; throughout the vast continent of India; throughout Africa, from
Mount Atlas to the Cape of Good Hope. In all these countries, the bison
seems chiefly to prevail; where they are found to have a smooth soft
hair, are <PB N="21" REF="27"/> very nimble of foot, and in some measure
supply the want of horses. The bison breed is also more expert and
docile than ours; many of them, when they carry burthens, bend their knees to
take them up, or set them down: they are treated, therefore, by the natives
of those countries, with a degree of tenderness and care equal to their
utility; and the respect for them in India has degenerated even into blind
adoration. But it is among the Hottentots where these animals are chiefly
esteemed, as being more than commonly serviceable. They are their fellow
domestics, the companions of their pleasures and fatigues; the cow is at
once the Hottentot's protector and servant, assists him in attending
his flocks, and guarding them against every invader; while the sheep are
grazing, the faithful backely, as this kind of cow is called, stands or
grazes beside them: still, however, attentive to the looks of its master,
the backely flies round the field, herds in the sheep that are straying,
obliges them to keep within proper limits, and shews no mercy to robbers, or
even strangers, who attempt to plunder. But it is not the plunderers of the
stock alone, but even the enemies of the na∣tion, that these backelys are
taught to combat. Every army of Hottentots is furnished with a 
<PB N="22" REF="28"/> proper herd of these, which are let loose against
the enemy, when the occasion is most con∣venient. Being thus sent
forward, they over∣turn all before them; they strike every opposer down
with their horns, and trample upon them with their feet; and thus often procure
their masters an easy victory, even before they have attempted to strike
a blow. An animal so ser∣viceable, it may be supposed, is not without
its reward. The backely lives in the same cottage with its master, and, by
long habit, gains an affection for him; and in proportion as the man approaches
to the brute, so the brute seems to attain even to some share of human
sagacity. The Hottentot and his backely thus mutually assist each
other; and when the latter happens to die, a new one is chosen to succeed
him, by a council of the old men of the village. The new backely is then joined
with one of the ve∣terans of his own kind, from whom he learns his art, becomes
social and diligent, and is taken for life into human friendship and
protection.</P>
<P>The bisons, or cows with an hump, are found to differ very much
from each other in the several parts of the world where they are found. The
wild ones of this kind, as with us, are much larger than the tame. Some have
horns, and some are without any; some <PB N="23" REF="29"/> have them
depressed, and some raised in such a manner that they are useless
as weapons of an∣noyance or defence; some are extremely large; and others
among them, such as the zebu, or Barbary cow, are very small. They are all,
however, equally docile and gentle when tamed; and, in general, furnished
with a fine lustrous soft hair, more beautiful than that of our own breed;
their hump is also of different sizes, in some weighing from forty to
fifty pounds, in others less; it is not, however, to be considered as a
part necessarily belonging to the animal; and probably it might be cut away
without much injury: it resembles a gristly fat; and, as I am assured,
cuts and tastes somewhat like a dressed udder. The bisons of Malabar,
Abyssinia, and Madagascar, are of the great kind, as the pastures there
are plentiful. Those of Arabia, Petraea, and most parts of Africa, are
small, and of the zebu or little kind. In America, especially towards the
north, the bison is well known. The American bison, however, is found to be
rather less than that of the ancient continent; its hair is longer and
thicker, its beard more remarkable, and its hide more lustrous and soft.
There are many of them brought up tame in Carolina; however, their 
<PB N="24" REF="30"/> wild dispositions still seem to continue, for they
break through all fences to get into the corn∣fields, and lead the whole tame
herd after them, wherever they penetrate. They breed also with the tame kinds
originally brought over from Europe; and thus produce a race peculiar to that
country.</P>
<P>From all this it appears<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon, vol.
xxiii. p. 130.</BIBL></NOTE>, that naturalists have given various names to
animals in reality the same, and only differing in some few accidental
circumstances. The wild cow and the tame, the animal belonging to Europe, and
that of Asia, Africa, and America, the bonafus and the urus, the bison and
the zebu, are all one and the same, propagate among each other, and, in the
course of a few generations, the hump wears away, and scarce any vestiges
of savage fierceness are found to remain. Of all animals, therefore, except
man alone, the cow seems most extensively propagated. Its nature seems
equally capable of the rigours of heat and cold. It is an inhabitant as well of
the frozen fields of Iceland, as the burning desarts of Lybia. It seems an
ancient inmate in every climate, do∣mestic and tame in those countries
which have been civilized, savage and wild in the countries which are less
peopled, but capable of being <PB N="25" REF="31"/> made useful in all: able
to defend itself in a state of nature against the most powerful enemy
of the forest; and only subordinate to man, whose force it has
experienced, and whose aid it at last seems to require. However wild the
calves are which are taken from the dam in a savage state, either in Africa
or Asia, they soon become humble, patient, and familiar, and man may be
considered, in those countries, as almost helpless without their
assistance. Other animals preserve their nature or their form with
inflexible perseverance; but these, in every re∣spect, suit
themselves to the appetites and con∣veniencies of mankind; and as their
shapes are found to alter, so also does their nature; in no animal is
there seen a greater variety of kinds, and in none a more humble and pliant
dis∣position.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>THE BUFFALO.</HEAD>
<P>IF we should compare the shape of our com∣mon cow with that of
the bison, the difference will appear very great. The shaggy mane of the
latter, the beard, the curled forehead, the inverted horns, the broad breast,
and the narrow hinder parts, give it the appearance rather of 
<PB N="26" REF="32"/> a lion than a cow; and fit it more for a state of war
with mankind, than a state of servitude. Yet, notwithstanding these
appearances, both animals are found to be the same; or at least so nearly
allied, that they breed among each other, and propagate a race that continues
the kind.</P>
<P>On the other hand, if we compare the buffalo with our common cow,
no two animals can be more nearly alike, either in their form or their nature;
both equally submissive to the yoke, both often living under the same
roof, and em∣ployed in the same domestic services; the make and the turn
of their bodies so much alike, that it requires a close attention to
distinguish them: and yet, after all this, no two animals can be more
distinct, or seem to have stronger anti∣pathies to each other<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon.</BIBL></NOTE>. Were there but one of each kind
remaining, it is probable the race of both would shortly be extinct. However,
such is the fixed aversion formed between these creatures, that the cow
refuses to breed with the buffalo, which it nearly resembles; while it is
known to propagate with the bison, to which it has, in point of form, but a
very distant similitude.</P>
<P>The buffalo is, upon the whole, by no means so beautiful a
creature as the cow; his figure <PB N="27" REF="33"/> is more clumsy and
aukward; his air is wilder; and he carries his head lower, and nearer the
ground; his limbs are less fleshy, and his tail more naked of hair; his
body is shorter and thicker than that of the cow kind; his legs are higher;
his head smaller; his horns not so round, black, and compressed, with a
bunch of curled hair hanging down between them; his skin is also harder and
thicker, more black, and less furnished with hair; his flesh, which is
hard and blackish, is not only disagreeable to the taste, but likewise
to the smell. The milk of the female is by no means so good as that of the
cow; it is however produced in great abundance. In the warm countries, almost
all their cheese is made of the milk of the buffalo; and they supply butter
also in large quantities. The veal of the young buffalo is not better eating
than the beef of the old. The hide of this animal seems to be the most
valuable thing he furnishes. The leather made of it is well known for its
thickness, softness, and impene∣trability. As these animals are, in
general, larger and stronger than the cow, they are use∣fully employed in
agriculture. They are used in drawing burthens, and sometimes in carrying
them; being guided by a ring, which is thrust through their nose. Two
buffaloes yoaked in a <PB N="28" REF="34"/> waggon are said to draw more than
four strong horses; as their heads and necks are naturally bent downward,
they are thus better fitted for the draught, and the whole weight of their
bodies is applied to the carriage that is to be drawn forward.</P>
<P>From the size and bulk of the buffalo, we may be easily led to
conclude that he is a native of the warmer climates. The largest quadru∣pedes
are generally found in the torrid zone; and the buffalo is inferior, in point
of size, only to the elephant, the rhinoceros, or the hippopotamos. The
camelopard, or the camel, may, indeed, be taller, but they are neither so
long, or near so corpulent. Accordingly, we find this animal wild in many
parts of India; and tamed also wherever the natives have oc∣casion for his
services. The wild buffaloes are very dangerous animals, and are often found
to gore travellers to death, and then trample them with their feet, until they
have entirely mangled the whole body: however, in the woods they are not so
much to be feared as in the plains, because in the violence of their
pursuit their large horns are apt to be entangled in the branches of the
trees, which gives those who have been surprized by them, time to escape
the danger. There is scarce any <PB N="29" REF="35"/> other method of avoiding
their pursuit; they run with great swiftness; they overturn a tree of
moderate growth; and are such swimmers, as to cross the largest rivers
without any difficulty. In this manner, like all other large animals of the
torrid zone, they are very fond of the water; and, in the midst of their
pursuit, often plunge in, in order to cool themselves. The Negroes of
Guinea, and the Indians of Malabar, where buffaloes are in great abundance,
take great delight in hunting and destroying them; how∣ever, they never
attempt to face the buffalo openly, but, generally climbing up a tree, shoot
at him from thence, and do not come down till they find they have effectually
dispatched him. However, when they are tamed, no animal can be more patient
or humble; and though by no means so docile as the cow kind, yet they go
through domestic drudgeries with more strength and perseverance.</P>
<P>Although these animals be chiefly found in the torrid zone, yet
they are bred in several parts of Europe, particularly in Italy, where they
make the food and the riches of the poor. The female produces but one at a
time, in the same manner as the cow; but they are very dif∣ferent in the
times of gestation; for the cow, as we know, goes but nine months; whereas
the <PB N="30" REF="36"/> buffalo continues pregnant for twelve. They are all
afraid of fire; and, perhaps, in conse∣quence of this, have an aversion to
red colours, that resemble the colour of flame: it is said, that in those
countries where they are found in plenty, no person dares to dress in
scarlet. In general they are inoffensive animals, if un∣disturbed; as
indeed all those which feed upon grass are found to be; but when they are
wounded, or when even but fired at, nothing then can stop their fury; they
then turn up the ground with their fore feet, bellow much louder and more
terribly than the bull, and make at the object of their resentment with
un∣governable rage. It is happy, in such circum∣stances, if the person
they pursue has a wall to escape over, or some such obstacle,
otherwise they soon overtake, and instantly destroy him. It is
remarkable, however, that although their horns are so very formidable, they
in general make more use of their feet in combat, and rather tread their
enemies to death than gore them.</P>
<P>Having thus gone through the history of these animals, it may
be proper to observe, that no names have been more indiscriminately used
than those of the bull, the urus, the bison, and the buffalo. It therefore
becomes such as <PB N="31" REF="37"/> would have distinct ideas of each, to
be careful in separating the kinds, the one from the other, allowing the cow
for the standard of all. The urus, whether of the large enormous kind of
Lithuania, or the smaller race of Spain, whether with long or short horns,
whether with or with∣out long hair in the forehead, is every way the same
with what our common breed was before they were taken from the forest, and
reduced to a state of servitude. The bison, and all its varieties, which
are known by an hump between the shoulders, is also to be ranked in the
same class. This animal, whether with crooked or strait horns, whether
they be turned towards the cheek, or totally wanting, whether it be large or
diminutive, whatever be its colour, or whatever the length of its hair, whether
called the bonasus by some, or the bubalus by others, is but a variety of
the cow kind, with whom it breeds, and with whom of consequence it has the
closest connection. Lastly, the buffalo, though shaped much more like
the cow, is a distinct kind by itself, that never mixes with any of the
former; that goes twelve months with young; whereas the cow goes but nine; that
testifies an aversion to the latter; and, though bred under the same
roof, or feeding in the same pasture, has always kept separate; and 
<PB N="32" REF="38"/> makes a distinct race in all parts of the world. These
two kinds are supposed to be the only real varieties in the cow kind, of
which natu∣ralists have given so many varieties. With re∣spect to some
circumstances mentioned by tra∣vellers, such as that of many kinds
defending themselves by voiding their dung against their pursuers; this
is a practice which they have in common with other timid creatures when
pur∣sued, and arises rather from fear than a desire of defence. The
musky smell also by which some have been distinguished, is found
common to many of these kinds, in a state of nature; and does not properly
make the characteristic marks of any. The particular kind of noise also
which some of them are known to make, which rather resembles grunting than
bellow∣ing or lowing, is but a savage variety, which many wild animals have,
and yet lose when brought into a state of tameness. For these
reasons, Mr. Buffon, whom I have followed in this description, is of
opinion, that the zebu, or little African cow, and the grunting, or Sibe∣rian
cow, are but different races of the bison; as the shape of the horns, or
the length of the hair, are never properly characteristic marks of any
animal, but are found to vary with climate, food, and cultivation.</P>

<P><PB N="33" REF="42"/>In this manner the number of animals of the
cow kind, which naturalists have extended to eight or ten sorts, are
reduced to two; and as the utmost deference is paid to the opinion of Mr.
Buffon in this particular, I have taken him for my guide. Nevertheless, there
is an animal of the cow kind, which neither he, nor any other naturalist that
I know of, has hitherto de∣scribed, yet which makes a very distinct
class, and may be added as a third species.</P>
<P>This animal was shewn some years ago in London, and seemed
to unite many of the characteristics of the cow and the hog; hav∣ing the
head, the horns, and the tail of the former; with the bristles, the colour,
and the grunting of the latter. It was about the size of an ass, but
broader and thicker; the colour resembling that of an hog, and the hair
bristly, as in that animal. The hair upon the body was thin, as in the hog;
and a row of bristles ran along the spine, rather shorter and softer
than in the hog kind. The head was rather larger than that of a cow; the teeth
were en∣tirely resembling those of that animal, and the tongue was rough in
like manner. It fed upon hay; and, consequently, its internal confor∣mation
must have resembled that of the cow <PB N="34" REF="43"/> kind more than the
hog, whose food is always chosen of a kind more succulent. The eyes were
placed in the head as with the cow, and were pretty nearly of the same
colour; the horns were black and flattish, but bent rather backwards to the
neck, as in the goat kind; the neck was short and thick, and the back rather
rising in the middle; it was cloven footed, like the cow, without those
hinder claws that are found in the hog kinds. But the greatest variety of all
in this extraordinary creature, which was a female, was, that it had but two
teats, and, conse∣quently, in that respect, resembled neither of the
kinds to which, in other circumstances, it bore so strong a similitude.
Whether this ani∣mal was a distinct kind, or a monster, I will not pretend
to say; it was shewn under the name of the bonafus; and it was said, by
the per∣son who shewed it, to have come from India: but no credit is to be
given to interested ig∣norance; the person only wanted to make the animal
appear as extraordinary as possible; and I believe would scarcely
scruple a lie or two, to encrease that wonder in us, by which he found the
means of living.</P>

<PB N="35" REF="44"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. III. Of Animals of the Sheep and Goat Kind.</HEAD>
<P>AS no two animals are found entirely the same, so it is not to
be expected that any two races of animals should exactly correspond in
every particular. The goat and the sheep are apparently different, in the
form of their bodies, in their covering, and in their horns. They may from
hence be considered as two different kinds, with regard to all common and
domestic pur∣poses. But if we come to examine them closer, and observe
their internal conformation, no two animals can be more alike; their feet,
their four stomachs, their suet, their appetites, all are entirely the
same, and shew the similitude between them: but what makes a much
stronger connection is, that they propagate with each other. The buck goat is
found to pro∣duce with the ewe an animal that in two or three generations
returns to the sheep, and seems to retain no marks of its ancient
pro∣genitor<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon passim.</BIBL></NOTE>. The
sheep and the goat, therefore, may be considered as belonging to one
fa∣mily; and were the whole races reduced to one <PB N="36" REF="45"/> of each,
they would quickly replenish the earth with their kind.</P>
<P>If we examine the sheep and goat internally, we shall find, as
was said, that their confor∣mation is entirely the same; nor is their
structure very remote from that of the cow kind, which they resemble in
their hoofs, and in their chew∣ing the cud. Indeed, all ruminant animals are
internally very much alike. The goat, the sheep, or the deer, exhibit to the
eye of the anatomist the same parts in miniature, which the cow or the
bison exhibited in the great. But the differ∣ences between those animals
are, nevertheless, sufficiently apparent. Nature has obviously marked the
distinctions between the cow and the sheep kind, by their form and size;
and they are also distinguished from those of the deer kind, by never
shedding their horns. In∣deed, the form and figure of these animals, if
there were nothing else, would seldom fail of guiding us to the kind; and
we might almost, upon sight, tell which belongs to the deer kind, and which
are to be degraded into that of the goat. However, the annually shedding the
horns in the deer, and the permanence in the sheep, draws a pretty exact line
between the kinds; so that we may hold to this distinction only, and define
the sheep and goat kind as ru∣minant <PB N="37" REF="46"/> animals of a
smaller size, that never shed their horns.</P>
<P>If we consider these harmless and useful ani∣mals in one
point of view, we shall find that both have been long reclaimed, and brought
into a state of domestic servitude. Both seem to require protection
from man; and are, in some measure, pleased with his society. The
sheep, indeed, is the more serviceable creature of the two; but the goat
has more sensibility and attachment. The attending upon both was once the
employment of the wisest and the best of men; and those have been ever
supposed the happiest times, in which these harmless creatures were
considered as the chief objects of human attention. In the earliest ages,
the goat seemed rather the greater favourite; and, indeed, it continues
such to this day among the poor. However, the sheep has long since become
the principal object of human care; while the goat is disregarded by the
generality of mankind, or become the possession only of the lowest of
the people. The sheep, therefore, and its varieties, may be considered
first; and the goat, with all those of its kind, will then properly
follow.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<PB N="38" REF="47"/>
<HEAD>THE SHEEP.</HEAD>
<P>THOSE animals that take refuge under the protection of man, in a
few generations be∣come indolent and helpless. Having lost the habit of
self-defence, they seem to lose also the instincts of nature. The
sheep, in its present domestic state, is of all animals the most
de∣fenceless and inoffensive. With its liberty it seems to have been
deprived of its swiftness and cunning; and what in the ass might rather
be called patience, in the sheep appears to be stupidity. With no one
quality to fit it for self-preservation, it makes vain efforts at all.
Without swiftness, it endeavours to fly; and without strength,
sometimes offers to oppose. But these feeble attempts rather incite than
re∣press the insults of every enemy; and the dog follows the flock with
greater delight upon seeing them fly, and attacks them with more fierceness
upon their unsupported attempts at resistance. Indeed they run together
in flocks; rather with the hopes of losing their single danger in the
crowd, than of uniting to repress the attack by numbers. The sheep,
therefore, were it exposed in its present state to struggle with its
natural enemies of the forest, it would <PB N="39" REF="48"/> soon be
extirpated. Loaded with an heavy fleece, deprived of the defence of its horns,
and rendered heavy, slow, and feeble, it can have no other safety but what
it finds from man. This animal is now, therefore, obliged to rely solely upon
that art for protection, to which it originally owes its degradation.</P>
<P>But we are not to impute to Nature the formation of an animal so
utterly unprovided against its enemies, and so unfit for defence. The
moufflon, which is the sheep in a savage state, is a bold, fleet
creature, able to escape from the greater animals by its swiftness, or to
oppose the smaller kinds with the arms it has received from Nature. It is
by human art alone that the sheep is become the tardy de∣fenceless creature
we find it. Every race of quadrupedes might easily be corrupted by the same
allurements by which the sheep has been thus debilitated and depressed.
While undi∣sturbed, and properly supplied, none are found to set any
bounds to their appetite. They all pursue their food while able, and continue
to graze, till they often die of disorders occasioned by too much
fatness. But it is very different with them in a state of nature: they are
in the forest surrounded by dangers, and alarmed with unceasing
hostilities; they are pursued <PB N="40" REF="49"/> every hour from one
tract of country to ano∣ther; and spend a great part of their time in
attempts to avoid their enemies. Thus con∣stantly exercised, and
continually practising all the arts of defence and escape, the animal at
once preserves its life and native independance, together with its
swiftness, and the slender agi∣lity of its form.</P>
<P>The sheep, in its servile state, seems to be di∣vested
of all inclinations of its own; and of all animals it appears the most
stupid. Every qua∣drupede has a peculiar turn of countenance, a
physiognomy, if we may so call it, that generally marks its nature. The
sheep seems to have none of those traits that betoken either courage or
cunning; its large eyes, separated from each other, its ears sticking out
on each side, and its narrow nostrils, all testify the extreme
simpli∣city of this creature; and the position of its horns also, shew
that Nature designed the sheep rather for flight than combat. It appears a
large mass of flesh, supported upon four small strait legs, ill
fitted for carrying such a burthen; its mo∣tions are aukward, it is easily
fatigued, and often sinks under the weight of its own cor∣pulency. In
proportion as these marks of human transformation are more numerous, the
animal becomes more helpless and stupid. Those which live upon a more
fertile pasture, <PB N="41" REF="50"/> and grow fat, become entirely feeble;
those that want horns, are found more dull and heavy than the rest<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Daubenton upon the Sheep.</BIBL></NOTE>; those
whose fleeces are longest and finest, are most subject to a variety
of disorders; and, in short, whatever changes have been wrought in this
animal by the in∣dustry of man, are entirely calculated for human advantage,
and not for that of the creature itself. It might require a succession
of ages, before the sheep could be restored to its primitive state of
activity, so as to become a match for its pursuers of the forest.</P>
<P>The goat, which it resembles in so many other respects, is
much its superior. The one has its particular attachments, sees danger, and
generally contrives to escape it; but the other is timid without a cause,
and secure when real danger approaches. Nor is the sheep, when bred up tame
in the house, and familiarized with its keepers, less obstinately
absurd: from being dull and timid, it then acquires a de∣gree of pert
familiarity; buts with its head, be∣comes mischievous, and shews itself
every way unworthy of being singled out from the rest of the flock. Thus it
seems rather formed for slavery than friendship; and framed more for the
necessities than the amusements of <PB N="42" REF="51"/> mankind. There is
but one instance in which the sheep shews any attachment to its keeper;
and that is seen rather on the continent, than among us in Great Britain.
What I allude to is, their following the sound of the shepherd's pipe.
Before I had seen them trained in this manner, I had no conception of those
descrip∣tions in the old pastoral poets, of the shepherd leading his
flock from one country to another. As I had been used only to see these
harmless creatures driven before their keepers, I sup∣posed that all the
rest was but invention: but in many parts of the Alps, and even some
provinces of France, the shepherd and his pipe are still continued, with
true antique simplicity. The flock is regularly penned every evening, to
pre∣serve them from the wolf; and the shepherd re∣turns homeward at
sun-set, with his sheep fol∣lowing him, and seemingly pleased with
the sound of the pipe, which is blown with a reed, and resembles the
chanter of a bag-pipe. In this manner, in those countries that still
con∣tinue poor, the Arcadian life is preserved in all its former purity; but
in countries where a greater inequality of conditions prevail, the shepherd
is generally some poor wretch who attends a flock from which he is to derive
no <PB N="43" REF="52"/> benefits, and only guards those luxuries which he is
not fated to share</P>
<P>It does not appear, from early writers, that the sheep was bred
in Britain; and it was not till several ages after this animal was
cultivated, that the woollen manufacture was carried on among us<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>British Zoology, vol. i. p. 23.</BIBL></NOTE>. That
valuable branch of business lay for a considerable time in foreign hands;
and we were obliged to import the cloth, manu∣factured from our own materials.
There were, notwithstanding, many unavailing efforts among our kings to
introduce and preserve the manu∣facture at home. Henry the Second, by a
pa∣tent granted to the weavers in London, directed, that if any cloth was found
made of a mixture of Spanish wool, it should be burned by the mayor. Such
edicts at length, although but slow∣ly, operated towards the establishing
this trade among us. The Flemings, who at the revival of arts possessed
the art of cloth-working in a supe∣rior degree, were invited to settle
here; and, soon after, foreign cloth was prohibited from being worn in
England. In the times of queen Elizabeth, this manufacture received every
en∣couragement; and many of the inhabitants of the Netherlands being then
forced, by the tyranny of Spain, to take refuge in this <PB N="44" REF="53"/>
country, they improved us in those arts, in which we at present excell the
rest of the world. Every art, however, has its rise, its meridian, and its
decline; and it is supposed by many, that the woollen manufacture has for
some time been decaying amongst us. The cloth now made is thought to be
much worse than that of some years past; being neither so firm nor so
fine, neither so much courted abroad, nor so serviceable at home.</P>
<P>No country, however, produces such sheep as England; either
with larger fleeces, or better adapted for the business of cloathing.
Those of Spain, indeed, are finer, and we generally require some of their
wool to work up with our own; but the weight of a Spanish fleece is no way
comparable to one of Lincoln or Warwickshire; and, in those counties, it is
no uncommon thing to give fifty guineas for a ram.</P>
<P>The sheep without horns are counted the best sort, because
a great part of the animal's nourishment is supposed to go up into the
horns<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Lisle's Husbandry, vol. ii. p.
155.</BIBL></NOTE>. Sheep, like other ruminant animals, want the upper fore
teeth; but have eight in the lower jaw: two of these drop, and are re∣placed
at two years old; four of them are re∣placed <PB N="45" REF="54"/> at three
years old; and all at four. The new teeth are easily known from the rest,
by their freshness and whiteness. There are some breeds, however, in
England, that never change their teeth at all; these the shepherds call the
leather mouthed cattle; and, as their teeth are thus longer wearing, they are
gene∣rally supposed to grow old a year or two be∣fore the rest<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Lisle's Husbandry, vol. ii. p. 155.</BIBL></NOTE>. The
sheep bring forth one or two at a time; and sometimes three or four. The
first lamb of an ewe is generally pot∣bellied, short and thick, and of
less value than those of a second or third production; the third being
supposed the best of all. They bear their young five months; and, by
being housed, they bring forth at any time of the year.</P>
<P>But this animal, in its domestic state, is too well known to
require a detail of its peculiar habits, or of the arts which have been used
to improve the breed. Indeed, in the eye of an observer of Nature, every art
which tends to render the creature more helpless and useless to itself,
may be considered rather as an injury than an improvement; and if we are to
look for this animal in its noblest state, we must seek for it in the
African desert, or the extensive plains of Siberia. Among the degenerate 
<PB N="46" REF="55"/> descendants of the wild sheep, there have been so
many changes wrought, as entirely to dis∣guise the kind, and often to
mislead the ob∣server. The variety is so great that scarce any two
countries has its sheep of the same kind; but there is found a manifest
difference in all, either in the size, the covering, the shape, or the
horns.</P>
<P>The woolly sheep<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon, vol.
xxiii. p. 168.</BIBL></NOTE>, as it is seen among us, is found only in
Europe, and some of the tem∣perate provinces of Asia. When transported
into warmer countries, either into Florida or Guinea, it loses its wool, and
assumes a co∣vering fitted to the climate, becoming hairy and rough; it
there also loses its fertility, and its flesh no longer has the same
flavour. In the same manner, in the very cold countries, it seems equally
helpless and a stranger; it still requires the unceasing attention of
mankind for its preservation; and although it is found to subsist, as
well in Greenland as in Guinea<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Krantz.</BIBL></NOTE>, yet it seems a natural inhabitant
of neither.</P>
<P>Of the domestic kinds to be found in the different parts of the
world, besides our own, which is common in Europe, the first variety is to
be seen in Iceland, Muscovy, and the coldest climates of the north. This,
which <PB N="47" REF="56"/> may be called the Iceland sheep, resembles our
breed, in the form of the body and the tail; but differs in a very
extraordinary manner in the number of the horns; being generally found to have
four, and sometimes even eight, growing from different parts of the forehead.
These are large and formidable; and the animal seems thus fitted by Nature
for a state of war: how∣ever, it is of the nature of the rest of its kind,
being mild, gentle, and timid. Its wool is very different, also, from that of
the common sheep, being long, smooth, and hairy. Its colour is of a dark
brown; and under its outward coat of hair, it has an internal covering, that
rather resembles fur than wool, being fine, short, and soft.</P>
<P>The second variety to be found in this ani∣mal, is that of the
broad tail'd sheep, so com∣mon in Tartary, Arabia, Persia, Barbary,
Sy∣ria, and Egypt. This sheep is only remarkable for its large and heavy
tail, which is often found to weigh from twenty to thirty pounds. It
sometimes grows a foot broad, and is obliged to be supported by a small
kind of board, that goes upon wheels. This tail is not covered un∣derneath with
wool, like the upper part, but is bare; and the natives, who consider it as a
very great delicacy, are very careful in attending and <PB N="48" REF="57"/>
preserving it from injury. Mr. Buffon supposes that the fat which falls
into the caul in our sheep, goes in these to furnish the tail; and that
the rest of the body is from thence deprived of fat in proportion. With
regard to their fleeces, in the temperate climates, they are, as in our own
breed, soft and woolly; but in the warmer latitudes, they are hairy: yet in
both they preserve the enormous size of their tails.</P>
<P>The third observable variety is that of the sheep called
strepsicheros. This animal is a native of the islands of the Archipelago,
and only differs from our sheep, in having strait horns, surrounded with
a spiral furrow.</P>
<P>The last variety is that of the Guinea sheep, which is
generally found in all the tropical cli∣mates, both of Africa and the
East-Indies. They are of a large size, with a rough hairy skin, short
horns, and ears hanging down, with a kind of dewlap under the chin. They differ
greatly in form from the rest; and might be considered as animals of
another kind, were they not known to breed with other sheep. These, of all
the domestic kinds, seem to approach the nearest to the state of
nature. They are larger, stronger, and swifter than the common race; and,
consequently, better fitted for a preca∣rious forest life. However, they
seem to rely, <PB REF="58"/>

</FIGURE> <PB N="49" REF="59"/> like the rest, on man for
support; being entirely of a domestic nature, and subsisting only in
the warmer climates.</P>
<P>Such are the varieties of this animal, which have been reduced
into a state of domestic ser∣vitude. These are all capable of producing
among each other; all the peculiarities of their form have been made by climate
and human cultivation; and none of them seem sufficiently independent, to
live in a state of savage nature. They are, therefore, to be considered
as a de∣generate race, formed by the hand of man, and propagated merely for his
benefit. At the same time, while man thus cultivates the domestic kinds, he
drives away and destroys the savage race, which are less beneficial, and
more head∣strong. These, therefore, are to be found in but a very small
number, in the most uncul∣tivated countries, where they have been able to
subsist by their native swiftness and strength. It is in the more
uncultivated parts of Greece, Sardinia, Corsica, and particularly in the
desarts of Tartary, that the mufflon is to be found, that bears all the marks
of being the primitive race; and that has been actually known to breed with the
domestic animal.</P>

<GAP DESC="duplicate" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/> <PB N="50" REF="62"/> with hair,
bears a stronger similitude to the ram than to any other animal; like the
ram, it has the eyes placed near the horns; and its ears are shorter than
those of the goat: it also re∣sembles the ram in its horns, and in all
the par∣ticular contours of its form. The horns also are alike; they are of a
yellow colour they have three sides, as in the ram, and bend backwards in the
same manner behind the ears. The muzzle, and the inside of the ears, are of
a whitish colour, tinctured with yellow; the other parts of the face are of a
brownish grey. The general co∣lour of the hair over the body is of a brown,
approaching to that of the red deer. The in∣side of the thighs and belly, are
of a white, tinctured with yellow. The form, upon the whole, seems more made
for agility and strength than that of the common sheep; and the moufflon is
actually found to live in a savage state, and maintain itself, either by
force or swiftness, against all the animals that live by rapine. Such is
its extreme speed, that many have been inclined rather to rank it among the
deer kind, than the sheep. But in this they are deceived, as the musmon has
a mark that en∣tirely distinguishes it from that species, being known
never to shed its horns. In some these are seen to grow to a
surprizing size; many of <PB N="51" REF="63"/> them measuring, in their
convolutions, above two ells long. They are of a yellow colour, as was said;
but the older the animal grows, the darker the horns become: with these they
often maintain very furious battles between each other; and sometimes they
are found broken off in such a manner, that the small animals of the
forest creep into the cavity for shelter<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Gmelin, as quoted by Buffon.</BIBL></NOTE>. When the
musmon is seen standing on the plain, his fore legs are always strait,
while his hinder legs seem bent under him; but in cases of more active
necessity, this seeming deformity is removed, and he moves with great
swiftness and agility. The female very much resembles the male of this
species, but that she is less, and her horns also are never seen to
grow to that prodigious size they are of in the wild ram. Such is the sheep
in its savage state; a bold, noble, and even beautiful animal: but it is
not the most beautiful creatures that are always found most useful to
man. Human industry has therefore destroyed its grace, to improve its
utility.</P>

<PB N="52" REF="64"/>
<HEAD>THE GOAT, AND ITS NUMEROUS VARIETIES.</HEAD>
<P>THERE are some domestic animals that seem as auxiliaries to
the more useful sorts; and, that by ceasing to be the first, are
con∣sidered as nothing. We have seen the services of the ass
slighted, because inferior to those of the horse; and, in the same
manner, those of the goat are held cheap, because the sheep so far
exceeds it. Were the horse or the sheep removed from nature, the inferior
kinds would then be invaluable; and the same arts would probably be
bestowed in perfecting their kinds, that the higher order of animals have
experienced. But in their present neg∣lected state, they vary but little
from the wild animals of the same kind; man has left them their primitive
habits and forms; and the less they owe to his assiduity, the more they
receive from nature.</P>
<P>The goat seems, in every respect, more fitted for a life of
savage liberty than the sheep<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon.</BIBL></NOTE>. It is naturally more lively, and more
possessed with animal instinct. It easily attaches itself to man,
and seems sensible of his caresses. <PB N="53" REF="65"/> It is also
stronger and swifter, more courageous, and more playful, lively,
capricious, and va∣grant: it is not easily confined to its flock, but
chuses its own pastures, and loves to stray re∣mote from the rest. It
chiefly delights in climb∣ing precipices; in going to the very edge of danger:
it is often seen suspended upon an eminence hanging over the sea, upon
a very little base, and even sleeps there in security. Nature has, in
some measure, fitted it for tra∣versing these declivities with ease;
the hoof is hollow underneath, with sharp edges, so that it walks as
securely on the ridge of an house, as on the level ground. It is an hardy
animal, and very easily sustained; for which reason it is chiefly the
property of the poor, who have no pastures with which to supply it.
Happily, however, it seems better pleased with the neg∣lected wild, than
the cultivated fields of art; it chuses the heathy mountain, or the shrubby
rock; its favourite food is the tops of the boughs, or the tender bark of young
trees: it seems less afraid of immoderate heat, and bears the warm
climates, better than the sheep: it sleeps exposed to the sun; and
seems to enjoy its warmest fervours: neither is it terrified at the
storm, or incommoded by the rain; immo∣derate cold alone seems to affect
it, and is said <PB N="54" REF="66"/> to produce a vertigo, with which this
animal is sometimes incommoded. The inconstancy of its nature is
perceivable in the irregularity of its gait; it goes forward, stops, runs,
ap∣proaches, flies, merely from caprice, and with no other seeming reason
than the extreme vi∣vacity of its disposition.</P>
<P>There are proofs of this animal's being na∣turally the friend of
man; and that the goat sel∣dom resumes its primoeval wildness, when once
reduced into a state of servitude. In the year 1698, an English
vessel happening to touch at the islands of Bonavista, two Negroes
came, and offered the sailors as many goats as they chose to take away.
Upon the captain's expressing his astonishment at this offer, the
Negroes assured him that there were but twelve persons in the island,
and that the goats were mul∣tiplied in such a manner as even to become a
nuisance: they added, that instead of giving any trouble to catch them,
they followed the few inhabitants that were left with a sort of obstinacy,
and rather became importunate with their tameness.</P>
<P>The goat produces but two at a time; and three at the most. But
in the warmer climates, although the animal degenerates, and grows less, yet
it becomes more fruitful, being ge∣nerally <PB N="55" REF="67"/> found to bring
forth three, four, and five at a single delivery. The buck is capable of
propagating at the age of one year, and the female at seven months; however,
the fruits of this premature generation are weak and de∣fective; and their
best breeding-time is gene∣rally delayed till the age of two years, or
eighteen months at least. One buck is sufficient for an hundred and fifty
goats; his appetites are excessive: but this ardour brings on a speedy
decay, so that he is enervated in four years at most, and even becomes old
before he reaches his seventh year. The goat, like the sheep, continues
five months with young; and, in some places, bears twice a year.</P>
<P>The milk of the goat is sweet, nourishing, and medicinal; not
so apt to curdle upon the stomach as that of the cow; and, therefore,
preferable to those whose digestion is but weak. The peculiarity of this
animal's food, gives the milk a flavour different from that either of the cow
or the sheep; for as it generally feeds upon shrubby pastures, and heathy
mountains, there is an agreeable wildness in the taste very pleasing to
such as are fond of that aliment. In several parts of Ireland, and the
highlands of Scotland, the goat makes the chief possession of the
inhabitants. On those mountains, where <PB N="56" REF="68"/> no other useful
animal could find subsistence, the goat continues to glean a sufficient
living; and supplies the hardy natives with what they consider as varied
luxury. They lie upon beds made of their skins, which are soft, clean, and
wholesome; they live upon their milk, with oat bread; they convert a part of
it into butter, and some into cheese; the flesh, indeed, they seldom
taste of, as it is a delicacy which they find too expensive; however, the
kid is con∣sidered, even by the city epicure, as a great rarity; and the
flesh of the goat, when properly prepared, is ranked by some as no way
inferior to venison. In this manner, even in the wildest solitudes, the
poor find comforts of which the rich do not think it worth their while to
dispos∣sess them; in these mountainous retreats, where the
landscape presents only a scene of rocks, heaths, and shrubs, that
speak the wretched∣ness of the soil, these simple people have their
feasts, and their pleasures; their faithful flock of goats attends them to
these awful solitudes, and furnishes them with all the necessaries of
life; while their remote situation happily keeps them ignorant of greater
luxury.</P>
<P>As these animals are apt to stray from the flock, no man can
attend above fifty of them at a time. They are fattened in the same 
<PB N="57" REF="69"/> manner as sheep; but, taking every precaution, their
flesh is never so good or so sweet, in our climate, as that of mutton.
It is other∣wise between the tropics. The mutton there becomes flabby and
lean, while the flesh of the goat rather seems to improve; and in some
places the latter is cultivated in preference to the former. We, therefore,
find this animal in almost every part of the world, as it seems fitted for
the necessities of man in both ex∣tremes. Towards the north, where the
pasture is coarse and barren, the goat is fitted to find a scanty
subsistence; between the tropics, where the heat is excessive, the
goat is fitted to bear the climate, and its flesh is found to improve.</P>
<P>One of the most remarkable varieties we find in the goat is in
that of Natolia. The Natolian goat, or, as Mr. Buffon calls it, the goat of
Angora, has the ears longer than ours, and broader in proportion. The male has
horns of about the same length with the goat of Europe, but black, and turned
very differently, going out horizontally on each side of the head, and
twisted round in the manner of a cork-screw. The horns of the female are
shorter, and en∣circle the ear somewhat like those of the ram. They are
of a dazzling white colour, and in all the hair is very long, thick, fine, and
glossy; <PB N="58" REF="70"/> which, indeed, is the case with almost all
the ani∣mals of Syria. There are a great number of ani∣mals about Angora, where
the inhabitants drive trade with their hair, which is sold either raw, or
manufactured into all parts of Europe. No∣thing can exceed the beauty of the
stuffs which are made from the hair of almost all the ani∣mals of that
country. These are well known among us by the name of camlet.</P>
<P>A second variety is the Assyrian goat of Ges∣ner, which is
somewhat larger than ours, with ears almost hanging down to the ground, and
broad in proportion. The horns, on the con∣trary, are not above two inches and
an half long, black, and bending a little backwards. The hair is of a fox
colour, and under the throat there are two excrescences, like the gills of a
cock. These animals are chiefly kept round Aleppo, for the sake of their
milk. They are driven through the streets, and their milk is sold to the
inhabitants as they pass along.</P>
<P>In the third variety may be reckoned, the little goat of America,
which is of the size of a kid, but the hair is as long as that of the
or∣dinary breed. The horns, which do not exceed the length of a man's finger,
are thick, and bend downwards so close to the head, that they almost
enter the skin.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="71"/>There is an animal of this kind at the Cape of
Good Hope, called the blue goat, which may be ranked as the fourth variety. It
is in shape like the domestic, but much larger, being nearly of the size
of a stag. Its hair is very short, and of a delightful blue; but it loses
a great deal of its beauty when the animal is dead. It has a very long beard;
but the horns are not so long in proportion as in other goats, being turned
spirally, in the manner of a cork-screw. It has very long legs, but well
propor∣tioned; and the flesh is very well tasted, but lean. For this
reason, in that plentiful country, it is chiefly killed upon account of its
skin. It is a very shy animal, and seldom comes near the Dutch
settlements; but they are found in great abundance in the more uncultivated
parts of the country. Besides these, they are found in this extensive
region of various colours, and many of them are spotted beautifully, with
red, white, and brown.</P>
<P>In fine, the Juda goat resembles ours in most parts, except in
size, it being much smaller. This animal is common in Guinea, Angola, and
all along the coasts of Africa: it is not much larger than a hare, but it is
extremely fat, and its flesh admirably tasted. It is in that country
universally preferred to mutton.</P>
<P>These animals seem all of one kind, with very 
<PB N="60" REF="72"/> trifling distinctions between them. It is true that they
differ in some respects; such as having neither the same colour, hair,
ears, or horns. But it ought to be considered as a rule in natural history,
that neither the horns, the colour, the fineness or the length of the hair,
or the po∣sition of the ears, are to be considered as mak∣ing an actual
distinction in the kinds. These are accidental varieties, produced by
climate and food, which are known to change even in the same animal, and give
it a seeming dif∣ference of form. When we see the shapes, the
inclinations, and the internal conformation of seemingly different creatures
nearly the same; and, above all, when we see them producing among each
other, we then have no hesitation in pronouncing the species, and
asserting that these are of the goat kind, with which they are so
materially connected.</P>
<P>But, although these are evidently known to belong to the goat
kind, there are others nearly resembling the goat, of whose kindred we
can∣not be equally certain. These are such as, being found in a state of
nature, have not as yet been sufficiently subjected to human observation.
Hence it is impossible to determine with pre∣cision to which class they
belong; whether they be animals of a particular kind, or merely the 
<PB N="61" REF="73"/> goat in its state of savage freedom. Were there but
one of these wild animals, the enquiry would soon be ended; and we might
readily allow it for the parent stock; but, in the pre∣sent case, there
are two kinds that have almost equal pretensions to this honour; and the
claims of which it has been found difficult to deter∣mine. The animals in
question are the sham∣moy and the ibex. These both bear very near
approaches to the goat in figure; have horns that never shed; and, at the
same time, are more different from each other than from the animal in
question. From which of these two sources our domestic goat is derived
is not easy to settle. Instead, therefore, of entering into the
discussion, I will content myself with the result of Mr. Buffon's
enquiries. He is of opinion that the ibex is the principal source, that our
domestic goat is the immediate descend∣ant, and that the shammoy is but a
variety from that stock, a sort of collateral branch of the same family.
His principal reason for giving the preference to the ibex is its having a
more mas∣culine figure, large horns, and a large beard; whereas the shammoy
wants these marks of pri∣mitive strength and wildness. He supposes,
therefore, in their original savage state, that our goat has taken after
the male of the parent <PB N="62" REF="74"/> stock, and the shammoy after
the female; and that this has produced a variety in these ani∣mals, even
before they underwent human cul∣tivation.</P>
<P>However this be, the two animals in question seem both well
fitted for their precarious life, being extremely swift, and capable of
running with ease along the ledges of precipices, where even the wolf or the
fox, though instigated by hunger, dares not pursue them. They are both
natives of the Alps, the Pyrenees, and the mountains of Greece; there they
propa∣gate in vast numbers, and continue to exist in spite of the hunter
and every beast of prey that is found incessantly to pursue them.</P>
<P>The ibex resembles the goat in the shape of its body; but
differs in the horns, which are much larger. They are bent backward, full of
knots; and it is generally asserted that there is a knot added every year.
There are some of these found, if we may believe Bellonius, at least two
yards long. The ibex has a large black beard, is of a brown colour, with a
thick warm coat of hair. There is a streak of black runs along the top of the
back; and the belly and back of the thighs are of a fawn colour.</P>
<P>The shammoy<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>M. Peroud's Account,
as quoted by Buffon.</BIBL></NOTE>, though a wild animal, is very easily
tamed, and docile; and to be found <PB N="63" REF="75"/> only in rocky and
mountainous places. It is about the size of a domestic goat, and
re∣sembles one in many respects. It is most agree∣ably lively, and active
beyond expression. The shammoy's hair is short, like that of the doe;
in spring it is of an ash colour, and in autumn a dun colour, inclining to
black, and in winter of a blackish brown. This animal is found in great
plenty in the mountains of Dauphiny of Piedmont, Savoy, Switzerland, and
Germany. They are peaceful, gentle creatures, and live in society with each
other. They are found in flocks of from four to fourscore, and even an
hundred, dispersed upon the crags of the mountains. The large males are
seen feeding detached from the rest, except in rutting time, when they
approach the females, and drive away the young. The time of their coupling is
from the beginning of November to the end of October; and they bring forth in
April and March. The young keeps with the dam for about five months, and
sometimes longer, if the hunters and the wolves do not separate them. It is
asserted that they live between twenty and thirty years. Their flesh is
good to eat; and they are found to have ten or twelve pounds of suet, which
far surpasses that of the goat in hardness and goodness. The 
<PB N="64" REF="76"/> shammoy has scarce any cry, as most animals are
known to have; if it has any, it is a kind of feeble bleat, by which the parent
calls its young. But in cases of danger, and when it is to warn the rest of
the flock, it uses an his∣sing noise, which is heard at a great
distance. For it is to be observed that this creature is ex∣tremely
vigilant, and has an eye the quickest and most piercing in nature. Its
smell also is not less distinguishing. When it sees its enemy
distinctly, it stops for a moment; and then, if the person be near, in an
instant after it flies off. In the same manner, by its smell, it can
discover a man at half a league distance, and gives the earliest notice.
Upon any alarm, therefore, or any apprehensions of danger, the shammoy
begins his hissing note with such force, that the rocks and the forests
re-echo to the sound. The first hiss continues as long as the time of one
inspiration. In the beginning it is very sharp, and deeper towards the
close. The animal having, after this first alarm, re∣posed a moment,
again looks round, and, per∣ceiving the reality of its fears, continues to
hiss by intervals, until it has spread the alarm to a very great
distance. During this time, it seems in the most violent agitation; it
strikes the ground with its fore-foot, and sometimes with 
<PB N="65" REF="77"/> both: it bounds from rock to rock; it turns and looks
round; it runs to the edge of the precipice; and, still perceiving the enemy,
flies with all its speed. The hissing of the male is much louder and
sharper than that of the fe∣male; it is performed through the nose; and is
properly no more than a very strong breath, driven violently through a
small apperture. The shammoy feeds upon the best herbage, and chuses
the most delicate parts of the plants, the flower and the tender buds. It is
not less delicate with regard to several aromatic herbs, which grow upon
the sides of the mountains. It drinks but very little while it feeds upon the
succulent herbage, and chews the cud in the intervals of feeding. This animal
is greatly admired for the beauty of its eyes, which are round and sparkling,
and which mark the warmth of its constitution. Its head is furnished with
two small horns, of about half a foot long, of a beautiful black, and
rising from the fore∣head, almost betwixt the eyes. These, con∣trary to
what they are found in other animals, instead of going backwards or
sideways, jet out forward, and bend a little, at their extremities, backward,
in a small circle, and end in a very sharp point. The ears are placed in a
very elegant manner, near the horns; and there are <PB N="66" REF="78"/> two
stripes of black on each side of the face, the rest being of a whitish
yellow, which never changes. The horn of this animal is often used as the
head of a cane. Those of the female are less, and not so much bent; and
some farriers are seen to bleed cattle with them. These ani∣mals are so
much incommoded by heat, that they are never found in summer, except in the
caverns of rocks, amidst fragments of unmelted ice, under the shade of high
and spreading trees, or of rough and hanging precipices, that face the north,
and which keep off entirely the rays of the sun. They go to pasture both
morning and evening, and seldom during the heat of the day. They run along
the rocks with great ease and seeming indifference, and leap from one to
another, so that no dogs are able to pursue them. There is nothing more
extraordinary than to see them climbing and descending precipices, that to
all other qua∣drupedes are inaccessible. They always mount or descend in
an oblique direction; and throw themselves down a rock of thirty feet, and
light with great security upon some excre∣scence, or fragment, on the
side of the precipice, which is just large enough to place their feet upon;
they strike the rock, however, in their descent, with their feet, three or
four times, <PB N="67" REF="79"/> to stop the velocity of their motion; and,
when they have got upon their base below, they at once seem fixed and
secure. In fact, to see them jump in this manner, they seem rather to
have wings than legs; some, indeed, pretend to say that they use their
horns for climbing, but this wants confirmation. Cer∣tain it is that their legs
alone are formed for this arduous employment, the hinder being ra∣ther longer
than the former, and bending in such a manner that, when they descend upon
them, they break the force of the fall. It is also asserted, that when
they feed, one of them always stands as centinel; but how far this may be
true is questionable. For certain, while they feed, there are some of them
that keep continually gazing round the rest; but this is practised among
all gregarious animals; so that when they see any danger, they warn the
rest of the herd of its approach. During the rigours of winter, the shammoy
sleeps in the thicker forests, and feeds upon the shrubs and the buds of
the pine-tree. It sometimes turns up the snow with its foot to look for
herbage; and, where it is green, makes a delicious repast. The more craggy
and uneven the forest, the more this animal is pleased with the abode,
which thus adds to its security. The hunting the <PB N="68" REF="80"/>
shammoy is very laborious and extremely dif∣ficult. The most usual way is
to hide behind the clefts of the rocks and shoot them. This, however, must
be done with great precaution; the sportsman must creep for a vast way
upon his belly, in silence, and take also the advan∣tage of the wind, which
if it blow from him they would instantly perceive. When arrived at a proper
distance, he then advances his piece, which is to be rifle barrelled, and to
carry one ball, and tries his fortune among them. Some also pursue this
animal as they do the stag, by placing proper persons at all the
passages of a glade, or valley, and then sending in others to rouse the
game. Dogs are quite useless in this chace, as they rather alarm than
overtake. Nor is it without danger even to the men; for it often happens that
when the animal finds it∣self over-pressed, it drives at the hunter with
its head, and often tumbles him down the neigh∣bouring precipice. This animal
cannot go upon ice when smooth; but if there be the least inequalities on
its surface, it then bounds along in security, and quickly evades all
pursuit.</P>
<P>The skin of the shammoy was once famous, when tanned, for its
softness and warmth; at present, however, since the art of tanning has
been brought to greater perfection, the leather <PB N="69" REF="81"/> called
shammoy is made also from those of the tame goat, the sheep, and the
deer. Many me∣dicinal virtues also were said to reside in the blood, fat,
gall, and the concretion sometimes found in the stomach of this animal,
called the German bezoar. The fat, mixed with milk, was said to be good in
ulcers of the lungs. The gall was said to be useful in strengthening the
sight; the stone, which is generally about the size of a walnut and
blackish, was formerly in great request for having the same virtues with
oriental bezoar. However, in the present enlightened state of physic, all
these medicines are quite out of repute; and, although we have the names of
several medicines procurable from quadrupedes, yet, except the musk or
harts∣horn alone, I know of none in any degree of reputation. It is true, the
fat, the urine, the beak, and even the dung, of various animals, may be found
efficacious where better remedies are not to be had; but they are far
surpassed by by many at present in use, whose operations we know,
and whose virtues are confirmed by re∣peated experience.</P>
<P>Such are the quadrupedes that more pecu∣liarly belong to the goat
kind. Each of these, in all probability, can engender and breed with the
other; and were the whole race extin∣guished, <PB N="70" REF="82"/> except any
two, these would be suf∣ficient to replenish the world, and continue the
kind. Nature, however, proceeds in her va∣riations by slow and insensible
degrees, and scarce draws a firm distinguished line between any two
neighbouring races of animals what∣soever. Thus it is hard to discover
where the sheep ends and the goat begins; and we shall find it still
harder to fix precisely the boundaries between the goat kind and the deer. In
all transitions from one kind to the other, there are to be found a middle
race of animals, that seem to partake of the nature of both, and that can
precisely be referred to nei∣ther. That race of quadrupedes, called the
Gazelles, are of this kind; they are properly neither goat nor deer, and yet
they have many of the marks of both; they make the shade between these two
kinds, and fill up the chasm in nature.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>THE GAZELLES.</HEAD>
<P>THE Gazelles, of which there are several kinds, can, with
propriety, be referred neither to the goat or the deer; and yet they partake of
both natures. Like the goat, they have hollow horns that never fall, which is
other∣wise in the deer. They have a gall-bladder, <PB N="71" REF="83"/> which
is found in the goat and not in the deer; and, like that animal, they feed
rather upon shrubs than grassy pastures. On the other hand, they
resemble the roe-buck in size and delicacy of form; they have deep pits
under the eyes like that animal; they resemble the roe-buck in the colour and
nature of their hair; they resemble him in the bunches upon their legs, which
only differ in being upon the fore-legs in these, and on the hind legs in the
other. They seem, therefore, to be of a middle nature between these two
kinds; or, to speak with greater truth and precision, they form a
distinct kind by themselves.</P>
<P>The distinguishing marks of this tribe of animals, by which
they differ both from the goat and deer, are these: their horns are made
differently, being annulated or ringed round, at the same time that there are
longitudinated de∣pressions running from the bottom to the point. They have
bunches of hair upon their fore-legs; they have a streak of black, red, or
brown, running along the lower part of their sides, and three streaks of
whitish hair in the internal side of the ear. These are characters that
none of them are without; besides these, there are others which, in
general, they are found to have, and which are more obvious to the be∣holder. 
<PB N="72" REF="84"/> Of all animals in the world, the ga∣zelle has the most
beautiful eye, extremely brilliant, and yet so meek that all the eastern
poets compare the eyes of their mistresses to those of this animal. A
gazelle-eyed beauty is considered as the highest cmpliment that a lover can
pay; and, indeed, the Greeks themselves thought it no inelegant piece of
flattery to resemble the eyes of a beautiful wo∣man to those of a cow. The
gazelle, for the most part, is more delicately and finely limbed than even
the roe-buck; its hair is as short, but finer and more glossy. Its hinder
legs are longer than those before, as in the hare, which gives it greater
security in ascending or de∣scending steep places. Their swiftness
is equal, if not superior to that of the roe; but as the latter bounds
forward, so these run along in an even uninterrupted course. Most of
them are brown upon the back, white under the belly, with a black stripe,
separating these co∣lours between. Their tail is of various lengths, but in
all covered with pretty long hair; and their ears are beautiful, well placed,
and ter∣minating in a point. They all have a cloven hoof, like the sheep;
they all have permanent horns; and the female has them smaller than the
male.</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="85"/>Of these animals, Mr. Buffon makes twelve
varieties; which, however, is much fewer than what other naturalists have
made them. The first is the Gazella, properly so called, which is of the
size of the roe-buck, and very much re∣sembling it in all the proportions
of its body, but entirely differing, as was said, in the na∣ture and
fashion of the horns, which are black and hollow, like those of the ram, or
the goat, and never fall. The second he calls the Kevel, which is rather
less than the former; its eyes also seem larger; and its horns, instead
of being round, are flatted on the sides, as well in the male as the female.
The third he calls the Corin, which very much resembles the two former, but
that it is still less than either. Its horns also are smaller in
proportion, smoother than those of the other two, and the annular
prominences belonging to the kind are scarce discernable, and may rather be
called wrinkles than prominences. Some of these animals are often seen
streaked like the tiger. These three are supposed to be of the same
species. The fourth he calls the Zeiran, the horns only of which he has
seen; which, from their size, and the description of travellers, he
supposes to be∣long to a larger kind of the gazelle, found in India and
Persia, under that denomination.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="86"/>The fifth he calls the Koba, and the sixth
the kob; these two differ from each other only in size, the former being
much larger than the latter. The muzzle of these animals is much longer than
those of the ordinary gazelle; the head is differently shaped, and they
have no de∣pressions under the eyes. The seventh he calls after its
Egyptian name, the Algazel; which is shaped pretty much like the ordinary
gazelle, except that the horns are much longer, being generally three feet from
the point to the in∣sertion; whereas, in the common gazelle, they are not
above a foot; they are smaller also, and straiter, till near the
extremities, when they turn short, with a very sharp flexure: they are
black and smooth, and the annular prominences are scarcely observable.
The eighth is called the Pazan; or, by some, the bezoar goat, which greatly
resembles the former, except a small variety in their horns; and also
with this dif∣ference, that as the algazel feeds upon the plains, this is only
found in the mountains. They are both inhabitants of the same countries and
climate; being found in Egypt, Arabia, and Persia. This last is the animal
famous for that concretion in the intestines or stomach, called the
Oriental Bezoar, which was once in such repute all over the world for its
medicinal <PB N="75" REF="87"/> virtues. The word bezoar is supposed to take
its name either from the pazan or pazar, which is the animal that produces it;
or from a word in the Arabic language, which signifies antidote, or
counter-poison. It is a stone of a glazed blackish colour, found in the
stomach, or the intestines of some animal, and brought over to us from
the East-Indies. Like all other animal concretions, it is found to have a
kind of nu∣cleous, or hard substance within, upon which the external
coatings were formed; for, upon being sawed through, it is seen to have
layer over layer, as in an onion. This nucleus is of various kinds; sometimes
the buds of a shrub, sometimes a piece of stone, and sometimes a
marcasite. This stone is from the size of an acorn to that of a pidgeon's
egg; the larger the stone, the more valuable it is held; its price
encreasing, like that of a diamond. There was a time when a stone of four
ounces sold in Europe for above two hundred pounds; but, at present, the
price is greatly fallen, and they are in very little esteem. The bezoar is of
va∣rious colours; sometimes of a blood colour, sometimes of a pale yellow,
and of all the shades between these two. It is generally glossy,
smooth, and has a fragrant smell, like that of ambergrease, probably
arising from the aro∣matic <PB N="76" REF="88"/> vegetables upon which the
animal that produces it, feeds. It has been given in ver∣tigoes, epilepsies,
palpitations of the heart, cho∣lic, jaundice, and, in those places where the
dearness, and not the value of medicines, is consulted, in almost every
disorder incident to man. In all, perhaps, it is equally efficacious, acting
only as an absorbent powder, and pos∣sessing virtues equal to common
chalk, or crabs claws. Judicious physicians have therefore dis∣carded it;
and this celebrated medicine is now chiefly consumed in countries where the
know∣ledge of nature has been but little advanced. When this medicine was in
its highest repu∣tation, many arts were used to adulterate it; and many
countries endeavoured to find out a bezoar of their own. Thus we had occidental
bezoar, brought from America; German be∣zoar, which has been mentioned before;
cow bezoar, and monkey bezoar. In fact, there is scarce an animal, except of
the carnivorous kinds, that does not produce some of these con∣cretions in
the stomach, intestines, kidnies, bladder, and even in the heart. To
these ig∣norance may impute virtues that they do not possess;
experience has found but few cures wrought by their efficacy: but it is well
known, that they often prove fatal to the animal that <PB N="77" REF="89"/>
bears them. These concretions are generally found in cows, by their practice
of licking off their hair, which gathers in the stomach into the shape of a
ball, acquires a surprizing degree of hardness, and sometimes a polish
like leather. They are often as large as a goose-egg; and, when become too
large to pass, block up the passage of the food, and the animal dies. The
substance of these balls, however, is different from the bezoar mentioned
above; being rather a concretion of hair than of stone. There is a bezoar
found in the gall-bladder of a boar, and thence called hog bezoar, in very
great esteem; but perhaps with as little justice as any of the former. In
short, there is scarce an animal, or scarce a part of their bodies, in
which concre∣tions are not formed; and it is more than pro∣bable, as Mr. Buffon
justly remarks, that the bezoar so much in use formerly, was not the
production of the pazar, or any one animal only, but that of the whole gazelle
kind; who feed∣ing upon odoriferous herbs and plants, gave this admirable
fragrance to the accidental con∣cretions which they were found to produce. As
this medicine, however, is but little used at present, our curiosity is
much abated, as to the cause of its formation. To return, there∣fore, to the
varieties in the gazelle tribe, the <PB N="78" REF="90"/> ninth is called the
Ranguer, and is a native of Senegal. This differs somewhat in shape and
colour from the rest; but particularly in the shape of its horns, which are
strait to near the points, where they crook forward, pretty much in the
same manner as in the shammoy they crook backward. The tenth variety of the
gazelle is the Antelope, so well known to the English, who have given it
the name. This animal is of the size of a roe-buck, and resembles the
gazelle in many particulars, but differs in others: it has deeper eye-pits than
the former; the horns are formed differently also, being about sixteen
inches long, almost touching each other at the bottom, and spreading as
they rise, so as at their tips to be sixteen inches asunder. They have
the annular prominences of their kind, but not so distinguishable as in
the gazelle: however, they have a double flexure, which is very re∣markable,
and serves to distinguish them from all others of their kind. At the root
they have a tuft of hair, which is longer than that of any part of the body.
Like others of the same kind, the antelope is brown on the back, and white
under the belly; but these colours are not separated by the black streak
which is to be found in all the rest of the gazelle kinds. There are
different sorts of this animal, some <PB N="79" REF="91"/> with larger horns
than others, and others with less. The one which makes the eleventh va∣riety
in the gazelle kind, Mr. Buffon calls the Lidme, which has very large horns;
and the other, which is the twelfth and last, he calls the Indian Antelope,
the horns of which are very small.</P>
<P>To these may be added three or four varieties more, which it is
not easy to tell whether to re∣fer to the goat or the gazelle, as they
equally resemble both. The first of these is the Bu∣balus, an animal that
seems to partake of the mixed natures of the cow, the goat, and the deer. It
resembles the stag in the size and the figure of its body, and
particularly in the shape of its legs. But it has permanent horns, like the
goat; and made entirely like those of the gazelle kind. It also resembles
that ani∣mal in its way of living: however, it differs in the make of its head,
being exactly like the cow in the length of its muzzle, and in the
disposition of the bones of its scull; from which similitude it has
taken its name. This animal has a narrow long head; the eyes are placed very
high; the forehead short and nar∣row; the horns permanent, about a foot long,
black, thick, annulated, and the rings of the gazelle kind, remarkably large;
its shoulders <PB N="80" REF="92"/> are very high, and it has a kind of bunch
on them, that terminates at the neck; the tail is about a foot long, and tufted
with hair at the extremity. The hair of this animal is remark∣able in being
thicker at the middle than at the root: in all other quadrupedes, except the
elk and this, the hair tapers off from the bottom to the point; but in these,
each hair seems to swell in the middle, like a nine-pin. The bu∣balus
also resembles the elk in size, and the colour of its skin; but these
are the only simili∣tudes between them: as the one has a very large branching
head of solid horns that are an∣nually deciduous, the other has black
unbranch∣ing hollow horns that never fall. The bubalus is common enough in
Barbary, and has often been called by the name of the Barbary Cow, from which
animal it differs so widely. It par∣takes pretty much of the nature of the
antelope; like that having the hair short, the hide black, the ears pointed,
and the flesh good for food.</P>
<P>The second anomalous animal of the goat-kind, Mr. Buffon calls
the Condoma. It is supposed to be equal in size to the largest stag,
but with hollow horns, like those of the goat kind, and with varied flexures,
like those of the antelope. They are above three feet long; and, at their
extremities, about two feet <PB N="81" REF="93"/> asunder. All along the back
there runs a white list, which ends at the insertion of the tail; another
of the same colour crosses this, at the bottom of the neck, which it
entirely surrounds: there are two more of the same kind running round the
body, one behind the fore legs, and the other running parallel to it before the
hinder. The colour of the rest of the body is greyish, except the belly,
which is white: it has also a long grey beard; and its legs, though long, are
well proportioned.</P>
<P>The third that may be mentioned, he calls the Guiba. It
resembles the gazelles in every particular, except in the colour of the
belly, which, as we have seen, is white in them, but in this is of a deep
brown. Its horns also are not marked with annular prominences, but are
smooth and polished. It is also remarkable for white lists, on a brown
ground, that are dis∣posed along the animal's body, as if it were covered
with a harness. Like the former, it is a native of Africa.</P>
<P>The African Wild Goat of Grimmius is the fourth. It is of a dark
ash colour; and in the middle of the head is an hairy tuft, standing
upright; on both sides, between the eyes and the nose, there are very deep
cavities, greater than those of the other kinds, which contain a 
<PB N="82" REF="94"/> yellow oily liquor, which coagulates into a black
substance, that has a smell between musk and civet. This being taken
away, the liquor again runs out, and coagulates, as before. These cavities
have no communication with the eyes, and, consequently, this oozing
substance can have nothing of the nature of tears.</P>
<P>To this we may add the Chevrotin, or little Guinea Deer, which is
the least of all cloven footed quadrupedes, and perhaps the most beautiful;
its legs, at the smallest part, are not much thicker than the shank of a
tobacco-pipe; it is about seven inches high, and about twelve from the point
of the nose to the insertion of the tail. It is the most delicately
shaped animal in the world, being completely formed like a stag in
miniature; except that its horns, when it has any, are more of the gazelle
kind, being hollow and annulated in the same manner. It has two canine teeth
in the upper jaw; in which respect it differs from all other animals of the
goat or deer kind, and thus makes a species entirely distinct by itself.
This wonderful animal's colour is not less pleasing; the hair, which is
short and glossy, being in some of a beautiful yellow, except on the
neck and belly, which is white. They are natives of India, Guinea, and the warm
climates between the tropics; <PB N="83" REF="95"/> and are found in great
plenty. But though they are amazingly swift for their size, yet the Negroes
often overtake them in the pursuit, and knock them down with their sticks.
They may be easily tamed, and then they become familiar and pleasing; but
they are of such de∣licate constitutions, that they can bear no cli∣mate
but the hottest; and they always perish with the rigours of ours, when they
are brought over. The male in Guinea has horns; the fe∣male is without any; as
are all the kinds of this animal, to be found either in Java or Ceylon, where
they chiefly abound.</P>
<P>Such is the list of the gazelles; all which pretty nearly
resemble the deer in form, and de∣licacy of shape; but have the horns
hollow, single, and permanent, like those of the goat. They properly fill
up, as has been already ob∣served, the interval between these two kinds of
animals; so that it is difficult to tell where the goat ends, and the deer
may be said to begin. If we compare the gazelles with each other, we shall
find but very slight distinctions between them. The turn or the magnitude
of the horns, the different spots on the skin, or a dif∣ference of size
in each, are chiefly the marks by which their varieties are to be known; but
their <PB N="84" REF="96"/> way of living, their nature, and their peculiar
swiftness, all come under one description.</P>
<P>The gazelles are, in general, inhabitants of the warmer climates;
and contribute, among other embellishments, to add beauty to those
forests that are for ever green. They are often seen feeding in herds, on
the sides of the moun∣tain, or in the shade of the woods; and fly all
together, upon the smallest approaches of dan∣ger. They bound with such
swiftness, and are so very shy, that dogs or men vainly attempt to
pursue them. They traverse those pre∣cipices with ease and safety,
which to every quadrupede else are quite impracticable; nor can any animals,
but of the winged kind, over∣take them. Accordingly, in all those countries
where they are chiefly found, they are pursued by falcons; and this admirable
manner of hunting makes one of the principal amusements of the upper ranks of
people all over the east.</P>
<P>The Arabians, Persians, and Turks, breed up for this purpose,
that kind of hawk called the Falcon Gentle, with which, when properly trained,
they go forth on horseback among the forests and the mountains, the falcon
perching upon the hand of the hunter. Their expedition is conducted with
profound silence; their dogs are taught to hang behind; while the men, on 
<PB N="85" REF="97"/> the fleetest coursers, look round for the game.
Whenever they spy a gazelle at the proper distance, they point the falcon
to its object, and encourage it to pursue. The falcon, with the swiftness
of an arrow, flies to the animal; that, knowing its danger, endeavours, but too
late, to escape. The falcon soon coming up with its prey, fixes its talons,
one into the ani∣mal's cheek, the other into its throat, and deeply wounds it.
On the other hand, the ga∣zelle attempts to escape, but is generally wounded
too deeply to run far. The falcon clings with the utmost perseverance, nor
ever leaves its prey till it falls; upon which the hunters from behind
approaching, take up both, and reward the falcon with the blood of the spoil.
They also teach the young ones, by applying them to the dead animal's throat,
and accustom∣ing them betimes to fix upon that particular part; for if it
should happen that the falcon fixed upon any other part of the gazelle,
either its back or its haunches, the animal would easily escape among the
mountains, and the hunter would also lose his falcon.</P>
<P>They sometimes also hunt these animals with the ounce. This
carnivorous and fierce crea∣ture being made tame and domestic, generally 
<PB N="86" REF="98"/> sits on horseback behind the hunter, and re∣mains
there with the utmost composure, until the gazelle is shewn; it is then
that it exerts all its arts and fierceness; it does not at once fly at its
prey, but approaches slyly, turning and winding about until it comes within
the proper distance, when all at once it bounds upon the heedless animal,
and instantly kills it, and sucks its blood. If, on the other hand, it
misses its aim, it rests in the place, without at∣tempting to pursue
any farther, but seems ashamed of its own inability.</P>
<P>There is still another way of taking the ga∣zelle, which seems
not so certain, nor so amusing as either of the former. A tame gazelle is
bred up for this purpose, who is taught to join those of its kind, wherever
it perceives them. When the hunter, therefore, perceives a herd of these
together, he fixes a noose round the horns of the tame gazelle, in such a
manner, that if the rest but touch it, they are entangled; and thus pre∣pared
he sends his gazelle among the rest. The tame animal no sooner
approaches, but the males of the herd instantly sally forth to oppose
him; and, in butting with their horns, are caught in the noose. In this, both
struggling for some time, fall together to the ground; and, 
<PB N="87" REF="99"/> at last, the hunter coming up, disengages the one, and
kills the other. Upon the whole, however, these animals, whatever be the arts
used to pursue them, are very difficult to be taken. As they are
continually subject to alarms from carnivorous beasts, or from man, they
keep chiefly in the most solitary and inac∣cessible places, and find
their only protection from situations of the greatest danger.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. Of the Musk Animal.</HEAD>
<P>THE more we search into nature, the more we shall find how
little she is known; and we shall more than once have occasion to find,
that protracted enquiry is more apt to teach us mo∣desty, than to produce
information. Although the number and nature of quadrupedes at first glance
seems very little known; yet, when we come to examine closer, we find
some with which we are very partially acquainted, and others that are utterly
unknown. There is scarce a cabinet of the curious but what has the spoils
of animals, or the horns or the hoofs of qua∣drupedes, which do not come within
former descriptions. There is scarce a person whose trade is to dress
or improve furs, but knows several creatures by their skins, which no
naturalist has hitherto had notice of. But of all quadrupedes, there is none
so justly the reproach of natural historians, as that which bears the
musk. This perfume, so well known to the elegant, and so very useful in
the hands of the physician, a medicine that has for more than a century been
imported from the east in great quantities, and during all that time has 
<PB N="89" REF="101"/> been improving in its reputation, is, neverthe∣less,
so very little understood, that it remains a doubt whether the animal that
produces it be an hog, an ox, a goat, or a deer. When an animal with which we
are so nearly connected, is so utterly unknown, how little must we know
of many that are more remote and unserviceable! Yet naturalists proceed in
the same train, en∣larging their catalogues and their names, with∣out
endeavouring to find out the nature, and fix the precise history of those
with which we are very partially acquainted. It is the spirit of the
scholars of the present age, to be fonder of encreasing the bulk of our
knowledge than its utility; of extending their conquests than of improving
their empire.</P>
<P>The musk which comes to Europe, is brought over in small bags,
about the size of a pidgeon's egg, which, when cut open, appear to contain a
kind of dusky reddish substance, like coa∣gulated blood, and which, in
large quantities, has a very strong smell; but when mixed and diffused,
becomes a very agreeable perfume. Indeed, no substance now known in the
world has a stronger or a more permanent smell. A grain of musk perfumes
a whole room; and its odour continues for some days, without dimi∣nution. But
in a larger quantity it continues <PB N="90" REF="102"/> for years together; and
seems scarce wasted in its weight, although it has filled the
atmosphere to a great distance with its parts. It is par∣ticularly used
in medicine, in nervous and hy∣steric disorders; and is found, in such
cases, to be the most powerful remedy now in use: how∣ever, the animal
that furnishes this admirable medicine, has been very variously
described, and is known but very imperfectly.</P>
<P>The description given of this animal by Grew, is as follows. The
Musk animal is pro∣perly neither of the goat nor deer kind, for it has no
horns, and it is uncertain whether it ru∣minates or not; however, it wants the
fore teeth in the upper jaw, in the same manner as in ruminating animals;
but, at the same time, it has tusks like those of a hog. It is three feet
six inches in length, from the head to the tail; and the head is above half a
foot long. The fore part of the head is like that of a grey∣hound; and the ears
are three inches long, and erect, like those of a rabbit; but the tail is not
above two inches. It is cloven footed, like beasts of the goat kind; the hair
on the head and legs is half an inch long, on the belly an inch and an half,
and on the back and buttocks three inches; and proportionably thicker than in
any other animal. It is brown and white <PB REF="103"/> 
<FIGURE>
<FIGDESC>depiction of the musk deer</FIGDESC>
<HEAD>The Musk.</HEAD>

</FIGURE> <PB N="91" REF="104"/>alternately, from the root to the
point; on the head and thighs it is brown, but under the belly and tail white,
and a little curled, espe∣cially on the back and belly. On each side of the
lower jaw, under the corners of the mouth, there is a tuft of thick hair, which
is short and hard, and about three quarters of an inch long. The hair, in
general, of this ani∣mal, is remarkable for its softness and fine tex∣ture;
but what distinguishes it particularly are the tusks, which are an inch
and an half long, and turn back in the form of an hook; and more particularly
the bag which contains the musk, which is three inches long, two broad, and
stands out from the belly an inch and an half. It is a very fearful animal,
and, there∣fore, it has long ears; and the sense of hearing is so quick,
that it can discover an enemy at a great distance.</P>
<P>After so long and circumstantial a description of this animal,
its nature is but very little known; nor has any anatomist as yet examined
its internal structure; or been able to inform us whether it be a ruminant
animal, or one of the hog kind; how the musk is formed, or whether those
bags in which it comes to us be really be∣longing to the animal, or are only
the sophisti∣cations of the venders. Indeed, when we con∣sider 
<PB REF="105"/> <GAP DESC="duplicate" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/> 
<PB N="91" REF="106"/> <GAP DESC="duplicate" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/> 
<PB N="92" REF="107"/> the immense quantities of this substance which are
consumed in Europe alone, not to mention the east, where it is in still
greater re∣pute than here, we can hardly suppose that any one animal can
furnish the supply; and parti∣cularly when it must be killed before the
bag can be obtained. We are told, it is true, that the musk is often
deposited by the animal upon trees and stones, against which it rubs
itself when the quantity becomes uneasy; but it is not in that form which
we receive it, but al∣ways in what seems to be its own natural blad∣der. Of
these, Taverner brought home near two thousand in one year; and as the
animal is wild, so many must, during that space, have been hunted and
taken. But as the creature is represented very shy, and as it is found but
in some particular provinces of the east, the wonder is how its bag
should be so cheap, and furnished in such great plenty. The bag in
common does not cost (if I do not forget) above a crown by retail, and yet
this is supposed the only one belonging to the animal; and for the
obtaining of which, it must have been hunted and killed. The only way of
solving this difficulty, is to suppose that these bags are, in a great
measure, counterfeit, taken from some other animal, or from some part of
the same, <PB N="93" REF="108"/> filled with its blood, and a very little of
the perfume, but enough to impregnate the rest with a strong and permanent
odour. It comes to us from different parts of the east; from China, Tunquin,
Bengal, and often from Mus∣covy: that of Thibet is reckoned the best, and
sells for fourteen shillings an ounce; that of Muscovy the worst, and
sells but for three; the odour of this, though very strong at first,
being quickly found to evaporate.</P>
<P>Musk was some years ago in the highest re∣quest as a
perfume, and but little regarded as a medicine; but at present its reputation
is to∣tally changed; and having been found of great benefit in physic, it is
but little regarded for the purposes of elegance. It is thus that things
which become necessary, cease to continue pleasing; and the
consciousness of their use, destroys their power of administering
delight.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. V. Animals of the Deer Kind.</HEAD>
<P>IF we compare the stag and the bull as to shape and form, no two
animals can be more unlike; and yet, if we examine their internal structure,
we shall find a striking similitude between them. Indeed, their
differences, except to a nice ob∣server, will scarcely be perceivable. All
of the deer kind want the gall-bladder; their kidneys are formed differently;
their spleen is also pro∣portionably larger; their tail is shorter; and
their horns, which are solid, are renewed every year. Such are the slight
internal discrimina∣tions between two animals, one of which is among the
swiftest, and the other the heaviest of the brute creation.</P>
<P>The Stag is one of those innocent and peace∣able animals that
seems made to embellish the forest, and animate the solitudes of
nature. The easy elegance of his form, the lightness of his motions,
those large branches that seem made rather for the ornament of his head
than its de∣fence, the size, the strength and the swiftness of this
beautiful creature, all sufficiently rank him among the first of
quadrupedes, among the most noted objects of human curiosity.</P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="110"/>The Stag, or Hart, whose female is called a
<HI>hind,</HI> and the young a <HI>calf,</HI> differs in size and in horns
from a fallow-deer. He is much larger, and his horns are round; whereas in the
fallow kind they are broad and palmated. By these the animal's age is known.
The first year, the stag has no horns, but an horny excrescence, which is
short, rough, and covered with a thin hairy skin. The next year the horns
are single and straight; the third year they have two antlers, three the
fourth, four the fifth, and five the sixth; this number is not always
cer∣tain, for sometimes there are more, and often less. When arrived at the
sixth year, the ant∣lers do not always encrease; and, although the number
may amount to six or seven on each side, yet the animal's age is then
estimated ra∣ther from the size of the antlers and the thick∣ness of the
branch which sustains them, than from their variety.</P>
<P>These horns, large as they seem, are, not∣withstanding, shed
every year, and new ones come in their place. The old horns are of a firm
solid texture, and usually employed in making handles for knives and other
domestic utensils. But, while young, nothing can be more soft or tender;
and the animal, as if con∣scious of his own imbecility, at those times,
in∣stantly <PB N="96" REF="111"/> upon shedding his former horns, retires
from the rest of his fellows, and hides himself in solitudes and
thickets, never venturing out to pasture, except by night. During this time,
which most usually happens in the spring, the new horns are very painful,
and have a quick sensibility of any external impression. The flies
also are extremely troublesome to him. When the old horn is fallen off, the
new does not be∣gin immediately to appear; but the bones of the skull are
seen covered only with a transpa∣rent periosteum, or skin, which, as
anatomists teach us, covers the bones of all animals. Af∣ter a short time,
however, this skin begins to swell, and to form a soft tumour, which
con∣tains a great deal of blood, and which begins to be covered with a downy
substance that has the feel of velvet, and appears nearly of the same
colour with the rest of the animal's hair. This tumour every day buds forward
from the point like the graft of a tree; and, rising by degrees from the
head, shoots out the antlers on either side, so that in a few days, in
pro∣portion as the animal is in condition, the whole head is completed.
However, as was said above, in the beginning, its consistence is very
soft, and has a sort of bark, which is no more than a continuation of the
integument of <PB N="97" REF="112"/> the skull. It is velveted and downy, and
every where furnished with blood-vessels, that supply the growing horns
with nourishment. As they creep along the sides of the branches, the print
is marked over the whole surface; and the larger the blood-vessels, the
deeper these marks are found to be; from hence arises the inequa∣lity of
the surface of the deer's horns; which, as we see, are furrowed all along
the sides, the impressions diminishing towards the point, where the
substance is as smooth and as solid as ivory. But it ought to be
observed, that this substance, of which the horns is composed, begins
to harden at the bottom while the upper part re∣mains soft and still
continues growing; from whence it appears that the horns grow diffe∣rently in
deer from those of sheep or cows; in which they are always seen to
encrease from the bottom. However, when the whole head has received its full
growth, the extremities then begin to acquire their solidity; the velvet
co∣vering, or bark, with its blood-vessels, dry up, and then begin to fall;
and this the animal hastens, by rubbing its antlers against every tree it
meets. In this manner, the whole external surface being stripped off by
degrees, at length the whole head acquires its complete hardness,
expansion, and beauty.</P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="113"/>It would be a vain task to enquire into the
cause of the animal production of these horns; it is sufficient to
observe, that if a stag is ca∣stated when its horns are fallen off, they
will never grow again; and, on the contrary, if the same operation is
performed when they are on, they will never fall off. If only one of his
testicles are taken out, he will want the horn on that side; if one of the
testicles only be tied up he will want the horn of the opposite side. The
encrease of their provision also tends to fa∣cilitate the growth and the
expansion of the horns; and Mr. Buffon thinks it possible to re∣tard
their growth entirely by greatly retrench∣ing their food<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon, vol. xi. p. 113.</BIBL></NOTE>. As a proof of this,
nothing can be more obvious than the difference be∣tween a stag bred in
fertile pastures and un∣disturbed by the hunter, and one often pursued
and ill nourished. The former has his head expanded, his antlers numerous,
and the branches thick; the latter has but few antlers, the traces of the
blood-vessels upon them are but slight, and the expansion but little.
The beauty and size of their horns, therefore, mark their strength and
their vigour; such of them as are sickly, or have been wounded, never
shooting out that magnificent profusion so much <PB N="99" REF="114"/>
admired in this animal. Thus the horns may, in every respect, be resembled
to a vegetable substance, grafted upon the head of an animal. Like a
vegetable they grow from the extremi∣ties; like a vegetable they are for a
while co∣vered with a bark that nourishes them; like a vegetable they have
their annual production and decay; and a strong imagination might suppose
that the leafy productions on which the animal feeds, go once more to vegetate
in his horns<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Buffon has supposed something
like this. 
<BIBL>Vid. Passim.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P>The stag is usually a twelvemonth old before the horns begin to
appear, and then a single branch is all that is seen for the year
ensuing. About the beginning of spring, all of this kind are seen to
shed their horns, which fall off of themselves; though sometimes the
animal as∣sists the efforts of nature, by rubbing them against a tree.
It seldom happens that the branches on both sides fall off at the same
time, there often being two or three days between the dropping of the one and
the other. The old stags usually shed their horns first; which
gene∣rally happens towards the latter end of Fe∣bruary, or the beginning of
March. Those of the second head, (namely, such as are between 
<PB N="100" REF="115"/> five and six years old) shed their horns about the
middle or latter end of March; those still younger, in the month of April;
and the youngest of all, not till the middle, or the latter end of May; they
generally shed them in pools of water, whither they retire from the heat; and
this has given rise to the opinion of their always hiding their horns.
These rules, though true in general, are yet subject to many varia∣tions;
and universally it is known that a severe winter retards the shedding of
the horns.</P>
<P>The horns of the stag generally encrease in thickness and in
height from the second year of its age to the eighth. In this state of
perfection they continue during the vigour of life; but as the animal grows old
the horns feel the impres∣sions of age, and shrink like the rest of the
body. No branch bears more than twenty or twenty-two antlers even in the
highest state of vigour; and the number is subject to great va∣riety; for
it happens that the stag at one year has either less or more than the year
preceding, in proportion to the goodness of his pasture, or the continuance
of his security, as these animals seldom thrive when often rouzed by the
hun∣ters. The horns are also found to partake of the nature of the soil; in
the more fertile pa∣stures they are large and tender; on the con∣trary, 
<PB N="101" REF="116"/> in the barren soil they are hard, stunted, and
brittle.</P>
<P>As soon as the stags have shed their horns, they separate
from each other, and seek the plainer parts of the country, remote from every
other animal, which they are utterly unable to oppose. They then walk with
their heads stooping down, to keep their horns from strik∣ing against the
branches of the trees above. In this state of imbecility they continue near
three months before their heads have acquired their full growth and solidity;
and then, by rubbing them against the branches of every thicket, they at
length clear them of the skin which had contributed to their growth and
nourishment. It is said by some that the horn takes the colour of the
sap of the tree against which it is rubbed; and that some thus become
red, when rubbed against the heath; and others brown, by rubbing against
the oak; this, how∣ever, is a mistake, since stags kept in parks where
there are no trees, have a variety in the colour of their horns, which can be
ascribed to nothing but nature.</P>
<P>A short time after they have furnished their horns, they begin
to feel the impressions of the rut, or the desire of copulation. The old
ones are the most forward; and about the end of <PB N="102" REF="117"/>
August, or the beginning of September, they quit their thickets, and return
to the mountain in order to seek the hind to whom they call with a loud
tremulous note. At this time their neck is swolen; they appear bold and
furious; fly from country to country; strike with their horns against the
trees and obstacles, and con∣tinue restless and fierce until they have
found the female; who at first flies from them, but is at last compelled
and overtaken. When two stags contend for the same female, how timor∣ous
soever they may appear at other times, they then seem agitated with an
uncommon degree of ardour. They paw up the earth, menace each other with their
horns, bellow with all their force, and striking in a despe∣rate manner
against each other, seem deter∣mined upon death or victory. This combat
continues till one of them is defeated or flies; and it often happens that the
victor is obliged to fight several of those battles before it re∣mains
undisputed master of the field. The old ones are generally the conquerors
upon these occasions, as they have more strength and greater courage; and
these also are pre∣ferred by the hind itself to the young ones, as the
latter are more feeble, and less ardent. However, they are all equally
inconstant, keep∣ing <PB N="103" REF="118"/> to the female but a few days, and
then seeking out for another not to be enjoyed, perhaps, without a repetition
of their former danger.</P>
<P>In this manner the stag continues to range from one to the other
for about three weeks, the time the rut continues; during which he scarce
eats, sleeps, or rests, but continues to pursue, to combat, and to enjoy.
At the end of this period of madness, for such in this ani∣mal it seems
to be, the creature that was be∣fore fat, sleek, and glossy, becomes
lean, feeble, and timid. He then retires from the herd to seek plenty and
repose; he frequents the side of the forest, and chuses the most
nourishing pastures, remaining there till his strength is renewed. Thus
is his whole life passed in the alternations of plenty and want, of
corpulence and inanition, of health and sickness, without having his
constitution much affected by the violence of the change. As he is above five
years coming to perfection, he lives about forty years; and it is a general
rule, that every ani∣mal lives about seven or eight times the num∣ber of
years which it continues to grow. What, therefore, is reported concerning the
life of this animal, has arisen from the credulity of ignorance: some
say, that a stag having been <PB N="104" REF="119"/> taken in France, with a
collar, on which were written these words, 
<Q REND="inline">"Caesar hoc me donavit;"</Q> this was interpreted
of Julius Caesar; but it is not considered that Caesar is a general name
for kings, and that one of the Emperors of Germany, who are always stiled
Caesars, might have ordered the inscription.</P>
<P>This animal may differ in the term of his life according to the
goodness of his pasture, or the undisturbed repose he happens to enjoy.
These are advantages that influence not only his age, but his size and his
vigour. The stags of the plains, the vallies, and the little hills, which
abound in corn and pasture, are much more corpulent and much taller than
such as are bred on the rocky waste, or the heathy mountain. The latter are
low, small, and meagre, incapable of going so swift as the former,
although they are found to hold out much longer. They are also more artful in
evading the hunters; their horns are generally black and short, while those
of the lowland stags are reddish and flourishing; so that the animal
seems to encrease in beauty and stature in proportion to the goodness
of the pasture, which he enjoys in security.</P>
<P>The usual colour of the stag in England is red; nevertheless,
the greater number in other <PB N="105" REF="120"/> countries are brown. There
are some few that are white; but these seem to have obtained this colour
in a former state of domestic tame∣ness. Of all the animals that are
natives of this climate, there are none that have such a beautiful eye as the
stag: it is sparkling, soft, and sensible. His senses of
smelling and hear∣ing are in no less perfection. When he is in the least
alarmed, he lifts the head and erects the ears, standing for a few minutes as
if in a listening posture. Whenever he ventures upon some unknown ground,
or quits his native co∣vering, he first stops at the skirt of the plain
to examine all around; he next turns against the wind to examine by the
smell if there be any enemy approaching. If a person should happen to
whistle or call out, at a distance, the stag is seen to stop short
in his slow mea∣sured pace, and gazes upon the stranger with a kind of
aukward admiration: if the cunning animal perceives neither dogs nor fire-arms
preparing against him, he goes forward, quite unconcerned, and slowly
proceeds without of∣fering to fly. Man is not the enemy he is most afraid of;
on the contrary, he seems to be de∣lighted with the sound of the
shepherd's pipe; and the hunters sometimes make use of that in∣strument
to allure the poor animal to his de∣struction.</P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="121"/>The stag eats slowly, and is very delicate
in the choice of his pasture. When he has eaten a sufficiency, he then
retires to the covert of some thicket to chew the cud in security. His
rumination, however, seems performed with much greater difficulty than with
the cow or sheep; for the grass is not returned from the first stomach
without much straining, and a kind of hiccup, which is easily perceived
during the whole time it continues. This may proceed from the greater length of
his neck and the narrowness of the passage, all those of the cow and
the sheep kind having it much wider.</P>
<P>This animal's voice is much stronger, louder, and more tremulous
in proportion as he ad∣vances in age; in the time of rut it is even ter∣rible.
At that season he seems so transported with passion that nothing
obstructs his fury; and, when at bay, he keeps the dogs off with great
intrepidity. Some years ago, the Duke of Cumberland caused a tiger and a
stag to be enclosed in the same area; and the stag made so bold a
defence, that the tiger was at last obliged to fly. The stag seldom
drinks in the winter, and still less in the spring, while the plants are
tender and covered over with dew. It is in the heat of the summer, and during
the time of rut, that he is seen constantly fre∣quenting 
<PB N="107" REF="122"/> the side of rivers and lakes, as well to slake his
thirst as to cool his ardour. He swims with great ease and strength,
and best at those times when he is fattest, his fat keeping him buoyant,
like oil upon the surface of the water. During the time of rut he even
ven∣tures out to sea, and swims from one island to another, although
there may be some leagues distance between them.</P>
<P>The cry of the hind, or female, is not so loud as that of the
male, and is never excited but by apprehension for herself or her young. It
need scarce be mentioned that she has no horns, or that she is more
feeble and unfit for hunting than the male. When once they have conceived, they
separate from the males, and then they both herd together apart. The time of
gestation continues between eight and nine months, and they generally produce
but one at a time. Their usual season for bringing forth is about the
month of May, or the be∣ginning of June, during which they take great care to
hide their young in the most obscure thickets. Nor is this precaution
without rea∣son, since almost every creature is then a for∣midable enemy.
The eagle, the falcon, the osprey, the wolf, the dog, and all the rapa∣cious
family of the cat kind, are in continual <PB N="108" REF="123"/> employment to
find out her retreat. But, what is more unnatural still, the stag himself
is a pro∣fessed enemy, and she is obliged to use all her arts to
conceal her young from him as from the most dangerous of her pursuers. At
this sea∣son, therefore, the courage of the male seems transferred to the
female; she defends her young against her less formidable opponents by
force; and when pursued by the hunter, she ever offers herself to
mislead him from the prin∣cipal object of her concern. She flies before the
hounds for half the day, and then returns to her young, whose life she has
thus preserved at the hazard of her own. The calf, for so the young of this
animal is called, never quits the dam during the whole summer; and in winter,
the hind, and all the males under a year old, keep together, and assemble
in herds, which are more numerous in proportion as the season is more
severe. In the spring they se∣parate; the hinds to bring forth, while
none but the year olds remain together; however, these animals are in general
fond of herding and grazing in company; it is danger or neces∣sity alone
that separates them.</P>
<P>The dangers they have to fear from other animals, are nothing when
compared to those from man. The men of every age and nation 
<PB N="109" REF="124"/> have made the chace of the stag one of their most
favourite pursuits; and those who first hunted from necessity, have
continued it for amusement. In our own country, in particular, hunting was
ever esteemed as one of the prin∣cipal diversions of the great<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>British Zoology.</BIBL></NOTE>. At first, indeed, the
beasts of chace had the whole island for their range, and knew no other
limits than those of the ocean.</P>
<P>The Roman jurisprudence, which was formed on the manners of the
first ages, established it as a law, that, as the natural right of things
which have no master belongs to the first pos∣sessor, wild
beasts, birds, and fishes, are the property of whosoever could first
take them. But the northern barbarians, who over-ran the Roman empire, bringing
with them the strongest relish for this amusement, and, being now
possessed of more easy means of subsistence from the lands they
had conquered, their chiefs and leaders began to appropriate the right of
hunting, and, instead of a natural right, to make it a royal one. When the
Saxon kings, therefore, had established themselves into an heptarchy, the
chaces were reserved by each sovereign for his own particular amusement.
Hunting and war, in those uncivilized ages, <PB N="110" REF="125"/> were the
only employment of the great. Their active, but uncultivated, minds were
susceptible of no pleasures but those of a violent kind, such as gave
exercise to their bodies, and prevented the uneasiness of thinking. But
as the Saxon kings only appropriated those lands to the bu∣siness of the
chace which were unoccupied be∣fore, so no individuals received any injury.
But it was otherwise when the Norman kings were settled upon the throne.
The passion for hunting was then carried to an excess, and every civil
right was involved in general ruin. This ardour for hunting was stronger than
the con∣sideration of religion even in a superstitious age. The village
communities, nay, even the most sacred edifices, were thrown down, and all
turned into one vast waste, to make room for animals, the objects of a
lawless tyrant's plea∣sure. Sanguinary laws were enacted to preserve the
game; and, in the reigns of William Rufus and Henry the First, it was less
criminal to de∣stroy one of the human species than a beast of chace. Thus
it continued while the Norman line filled the throne; but when the Saxon line
was restored, under Henry the Second, the rigour of the forest laws were
softened. The barons also for a long time imitated the encroachments, as
well as the amusements, of the monarch; but <PB N="111" REF="126"/> when
property became more happily divided, by the introduction of arts and
industry, these extensive hunting grounds became more li∣mited; and as
tillage and husbandry encreased, the beasts of chace were obliged to give
way to others more useful to community. Those vast tracts of land, before
dedicated to hunting, were then contracted; and, in proportion as the useful
arts gained ground, they protected and encouraged the labours of the
industrious, and repressed the licentiousness of the sports∣man.
It is, therefore, among the subjects of a de∣spotic government only that
these laws remain in full force, where large wastes lie uncultivated for
the purposes of hunting, where the hus∣bandman can find no protection from
the in∣vasions of his lord, or the continual depreda∣tions of those animals
which he makes the ob∣jects of his pleasure.</P>
<P>In the present cultivated state of this country, therefore, the
stag is unknown in its wild na∣tural state; and such of them as remain
among us are kept, under the name of red deer, in parks among the fallow deer.
But they are become less common than formerly; its exces∣sive
viciousness, during the rutting season, and the badness of its
flesh, inducing most people to part with the species. The few that
still re∣main <PB N="112" REF="127"/> wild are to be found on the moors that
border on Cornwall and Devonshire; and in Ireland, on most of the large
mountains of that country.</P>
<P>In England, the hunting the stag and the buck are performed in the
same manner; the animal is driven from some gentleman's park, and then
hunted through the open country. But those who pursue the wild animal, have
a much higher object, as well as a greater va∣riety in the chace. To let
loose a creature that was already in our possession, in order to
catch it again, is, in my opinion, but a poor pur∣suit, as the reward when
obtained is only what we before had given away. But to pursue an animal that
owns no proprietor, and which he that first seizes may be said to
possess, has some∣thing in it that seems at least more rational;
this rewards the hunter for his toil, and seems to repay his industry.
Besides, the superior strength and swiftness of the wild animal
pro∣longs the amusement; it is possessed of more various arts to
escape the hunter, and leads him to precipices where the danger ennobles the
chace. In pursuing the animal let loose from a park, as it is unused to
danger, it is but little versed in the stratagems of escape; the hunter
follows as sure of overcoming, and feels none <PB N="113" REF="128"/> of
those alternations of hope and fear which arise from the uncertainty of
success. But it is otherwise with the mountain stag: having spent his
whole life in a state of continual apprehen∣sion; having frequently been
followed, and as frequently escaped, he knows every trick to mislead, to
confound, or intimidate his pur∣suers; to stimulate their ardour, and
enhance their success.</P>
<P>Those who hunt this animal have their pecu∣liar terms for the
different objects of their pur∣suit. The professors in every art take a
pleasure in thus employing a language known only to themselves, and thus
accumulate words which to the ignorant have the appearance of know∣ledge. In
this manner, the stag is called the first year, a <HI>calf,</HI> or
<HI>hind calf</HI>; the second year, a <HI>knobber</HI>; the third, a
<HI>brock</HI>; the fourth, a <HI>staggard</HI>; the fifth, a
<HI>stag</HI>; the sixth, an <HI>hart.</HI> The female is called an
<HI>hind</HI>; the first year she is a <HI>calf</HI>; the second, a
<HI>hearse</HI>; the third, a <HI>hind.</HI> This animal is said to
<HI>harbour</HI> in the place where he resides. When he cries he is said to
<HI>bell</HI>; the print of his hoof is called the <HI>slot</HI>; his tail is
called the <HI>single</HI>; his excrement the <HI>few∣met</HI>; his horns are
called his <HI>head:</HI> when simple, the first year, they are called
<HI>broches</HI>; the third year, <HI>spears</HI>; the fourth year, that part
<PB N="114" REF="129"/> which bears the antlers is called the <HI>beam,</HI> and
the little impressions upon its surface <HI>glitters</HI>; that which
rise from the crust of the <HI>beam</HI> are called <HI>pearls.</HI> The
antlers also have distinct names: the first that branches off is called
the <HI>antler</HI>; the second the <HI>sur antler</HI>; all the rest
which grow afterwards, till you come to the top, which is called the
<HI>crown,</HI> are called <HI>royal antlers.</HI> The little buds about the
tops are called <HI>croches.</HI> The impression on the place where the
stag has lain, is called the <HI>layer.</HI> If it be in covert or a thicket,
it is called his <HI>har∣bour.</HI> Where a deer has passed into a thicket,
leaving marks whereby his bulk may be guessed, it is called an
<HI>entry.</HI> When they cast their heads, they are said to <HI>mew.</HI>
When they rub their heads against trees, to bring off the peel of their
horns, they are said to <HI>fray.</HI> When a stag hard hunted takes to
swimming in the water, he is said to <HI>go sail</HI>; when he turns his
head against the hounds, he is said to <HI>bay</HI>; and when the hounds
pursue upon the scent, until they have unharboured the stag, they are
said to <HI>draw on the slot.</HI></P>
<P>Such are but a few of the many terms used by hunters in pursuing
of the stag, most of which are now laid aside, or in use only among
game-keepers. The chace, however, is con∣tinued <PB N="115" REF="130"/> in many
parts of the country where the red deer is still preserved, and still
makes the amusement of such as have not found out more liberal
entertainments. In those few places where the animal is perfectly wild, the
amuse∣ment, as was said above, is still superior. The first great
care of the hunter, when he leads out his hounds to the mountain side, where
the deer are generally known to harbour, is to make choice of a proper stag
to pursue. His am∣bition is to unharbour the largest and the boldest of
the whole herd; and for this purpose he examines the track, if there be any,
which if he finds long and large, he concludes, that it must have belonged to
a stag, and not an hind, the print of whose foot is rounder. Those marks
also which he leaves on trees, by the rubbing of his horns, shew his
size, and point him out as the proper object of pursuit. Now to seek out
a stag in his haunt, it is to be ob∣served, that he changes his manner of
feeding every month. From the conclusion of rutting-time, which is November,
he feeds in heaths and broomy places. In December they herd together, and
withdraw into the strength of the forests, to shelter themselves from
the severer weather, feeding on holm, elder trees, and brambles. The three
following months they <PB N="116" REF="131"/> leave herding, but keep four or
five in a com∣pany, and venture out to the corners of the forest, where they
feed on winter pasture, some∣times making their incursions into the
neigh∣bouring corn-fields, to feed upon the tender shoots, just as they
peep above ground. In April and May they rest in thickets and shady places,
and seldom venture forth, unless rouzed by approaching danger. In September
and October their annual ardour returns; and then they leave the thickets,
boldly facing every danger, without any certain place for food or harbour.
When, by a knowledge of these cir∣cumstances, the hunter has found out the
resi∣dence, and the quality of his game, his next care is to uncouple and
cast off his hounds in the pursuit: these no sooner perceive the
ti∣morous animal that flies before them, but they altogether open in full cry,
pursuing rather by the scent than the view, encouraging each other to
continue the chace, and tracing the flying animal with the most amazing
sagacity. The hunters also are not less ardent in their speed on
horseback, cheering up the dogs, and direct∣ing them where to pursue. On
the other hand, the stag, when unharboured, flies at first with the
swiftness of the wind, leaving his pursuers several miles in the rear;
and at length having <PB N="117" REF="132"/> gained his former coverts, and no
longer hearing the cries of the dogs and men that he had just left behind, he
stops, gazes round him, and seems to recover his natural tranquility. But
this calm is of short duration, for his inveterate pur∣suers slowly and
securely trace him along, and he once more hears the approaching
destruction from behind. He again, therefore, renews his efforts to escape,
and again leaves the pursuers at almost the former distance; but this
second effort makes him more feeble than before, and when they come up a
second time, he is unable to outstrip them with equal velocity. The poor
animal now, therefore, is obliged to have recourse to all his little arts of
escape, which sometimes, though but seldom, avail him. In proportion as
his strength fails him, the ardour of his pur∣suers is enflamed; he tracks
more heavily on the ground, and this encreasing the strength of the
scent, redoubles the cries of the hounds, and enforces their speed. It is
then that the stag seeks for refuge among the herd, and tries every
artifice to put off some other head for his own. Sometimes he will send
forth some little deer in his stead, in the mean time lying close
himself, that the hounds may overshoot him. He will break into one thicket
after another to find deer, rouzing them, gathering <PB N="118" REF="133"/> them
together, and endeavouring to put them upon the tracks he has made. His old
com∣panions, however, with a true spirit of ingra∣titude, now all forsake
and shun him with the most watchful industry, leaving the unhappy
creature to take his fate by himself. Thus abandoned of his fellows, he again
tries other arts, by doubling and crossing in some hard beaten highway,
where the scent is least per∣ceivable. He now also runs against the
wind, not only to cool himself, but the better to hear the voice, and judge
of the distance of his im∣placable pursuers. It is now easily perceivable
how sorely he is pressed, by his manner of running, which from the
bounding easy pace with which he begun, is converted into a stiff and
short manner of going; his mouth also is black and dry, without foam on it;
his tongue hangs out; and the tears, as some say, are seen starting
from his eyes. His last refuge, when every other method of safety has
failed him, is to take the water, and to attempt an escape by crossing
whatever lake or river he happens to approach. While swimming, he takes all
possible care to keep in the middle of the stream, lest, by touching
the bough of a tree, or the herbage on the banks, he may give scent to the
hounds. He is also ever found to swim <PB N="119" REF="134"/> against the
stream; whence the huntsmen have made it into a kind of proverb, 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>That he that would his chace find, must up
with the river and down with the wind.</HI></Q> On this occasion too he will
often cover himself under water, so as to shew nothing but the tip of his
nose. Every resource, and every art being at length ex∣hausted, the poor
creature tries the last remains of his strength, by boldly opposing
those ene∣mies he cannot escape; he therefore faces the dogs and men,
threatens with his horns, guards himself on every side, and for some time
stands at bay. In this manner, quite desperate, he furiously aims at the
first dog or man that ap∣proaches; and it often happens that he does not die
unrevenged. At that time, the more pru∣dent, both of the dogs and men, seem
willing to avoid him; but the whole pack quickly coming up, he is soon
surrounded and brought down, and the huntsman winds a <HI>treble mort,</HI>
as it is called, with his horn.</P>
<P>Such is the manner of pursuing this animal in England; but every
country has a peculiar method of its own, adapted either to the nature of the
climate, or the face of the soil. The ancient manner was very different from
that practised at present; they used their dogs only to find out the
game, but not to rouze it. <PB N="120" REF="135"/> Hence they were not curious
as to the music of their hounds, or the composition of their pack; the dog
that opened before he had dis∣covered his game, was held in no estimation.
It was their usual manner silently to find out the animal's retreat, and
surround it with nets and engines, then to drive him up with all their cries,
and thus force him into the toils which they had previously prepared.</P>
<P>In succeeding times the fashion seemed to alter; and
particularly in Sicily, the manner of hunting was as follows<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Pier. Hieroglyph. lib. vii. cap. vi.</BIBL></NOTE>. The
nobles and gentry being informed which way an herd of deer passed, gave
notice to one another, and appointed a day of hunting. For this purpose,
every one was to bring a cross-bow, or a long bow, and a bundle of staves,
shod with iron, the heads bored, with a cord passing through them all.
Thus provided they came to where the herd continued grazing, and casting
them∣selves about in a large ring, surrounded the deer on every side.
Then each taking his stand, unbound his faggot, set up his stake, and
tied the end of the cord to that of his next neighbour, at the distance of
about ten feet one from the other. Between each of these stakes was hung a
bunch of crimson feathers, and so <PB N="121" REF="136"/> disposed, that
with the least breath of wind they would whirl round, and preserve a sort
of fluttering motion. This done, the persons who set up the staves
withdrew, and hid themselves in the neighbouring coverts: then the chief
huntsman, entering with his hounds within the lines, rouzed the game with a
full cry. The deer, frighted, and flying on all sides, upon ap∣proaching the
lines, were scared away by the fluttering of the feathers, and wandered about
within this artificial paling, still awed by the shining and fluttering
plumage that encircled their retreat: the huntsman, however, still
pur∣suing, and calling every person by name, as he passed by their
stand, commanded him to shoot the first, third, or sixth, as he
pleased; and if any of them missed, or singled out another than that
assigned him, it was considered as a most shameful mischance. In
this manner, however, the whole herd was at last destroyed; and the day
concluded with mirth and feasting.</P>
<P>The stags of China are of a particular kind, for they are no
taller than a common house∣dog; and hunting them is one of the principal
diversions of the great. Their flesh, while young, is exceedingly good; but
when they ar∣rive at maturity, it begins to grow hard and tough: however, the
tongue, the muzzle, and <PB N="122" REF="137"/> the ears, are in particular
esteem among that luxurious people. Their manner of taking them is singular
enough: they carry with them the heads of some of the females stuffed, and
learn exactly to imitate their cry; upon this the male does not fail to appear,
and looking on all sides, perceives the head, which is all that the hunter,
who is himself concealed, dis∣covers. Upon their nearer approach, the whole
company rise, surround, and often take him alive.</P>
<P>There are very few varieties in the red deer of this country; and
they are mostly found of the same size and colour. But it is otherwise
in different parts of the world, where they are seen to differ in form, in
size, in horns, and in colour.</P>
<P>The stag of Corsica is a very small animal, being not above
half the size of those common among us. His body is short and thick, his
legs short, and his hair of a dark brown.</P>
<P>There is in the forests of Germany, a kind of stag, named by the
ancients the Tragelaphus, and which the natives call the Bran Deer, or the
Brown Deer. This is of a darker colour than the common stag, of a lighter
shade upon the belly, long hair upon the neck and throat, by which it appears
bearded, like the goat.</P>
<P><PB N="123" REF="138"/>There is also a very beautiful stag, which
by some is said to be a native of Sardinia; but others (among whom is Mr.
Buffon) are of opinion that it comes from Africa or the East Indies. He calls
it the Axis, after Pliny; and considers it as making the shade between the
stag and the fallow deer. The horns of the axis are round, like those of
the stag; but the form of its body entirely resembles that of the buck, and
the size also is exactly the same. The hair is of four colours; namely,
fallow, white, black, and grey. The white is predo∣minant under the belly, on
the inside of the thighs, and the legs. Along the back there are two rows of
spots in a right line; but those on other parts of the body are very
irregular. A white line runs along each side of this ani∣mal, while the head
and neck are grey. The tail is black above, and white beneath; and the hair
upon it is six inches long.</P>
<P>Although there are but few individuals of the deer kind, yet the
race seems diffused over all parts of the earth. The new continent of
America, in which neither the sheep, the goat, nor the gazelle, have been
originally bred, ne∣vertheless produces stags, and other animals of the
deer kind, in sufficient plenty. The Mexi∣cans have a breed of white stags
in their <PB N="124" REF="139"/> parks, which they call Stags Royal<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon, vol. xii. p. 35.</BIBL></NOTE>. The stags of
Canada differ from ours in nothing except the size of the horns, which in
them is greater; and the direction of the antlers, which rather turn back, than
project forward, as in those of Europe. The same difference of size that
ob∣tains among our stags, is also to be seen in that country; and, as we
are informed by Ruysch, the Americans have brought them into the same
state of domestic tameness that we have our sheep, goats, or black
cattle. They send them forth in the day-time to feed in the forests; and at
night they return home with the herdsman who guards them. The inhabitants
have no other milk but what the hind pro∣duces; and use no other cheese but
what is made from thence. In this manner we find, that an animal which seems
made only for man's amusement, may be easily brought to supply his
necessities. Nature has many stores of happiness and plenty in
reserve, which only want the call of industry to be produced, and now
remain as candidates for human appro∣bation.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<PB N="125" REF="140"/>
<HEAD>THE FALLOW DEER.</HEAD>
<P>NO two animals can be more nearly allied than the stag and the
fallow deer<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon, vol. xii. p.
36.</BIBL></NOTE>. Alike in form, alike in disposition, in the superb
fur∣niture of their heads, in their swiftness and timidity; and yet no two
animals keep more distinct, or avoid each other with more fixed animosity.
They are never seen to herd in the same place, they never engender
together, or form a mixed breed; and even in those coun∣tries where the
stag is common, the buck seems to be entirely a stranger. In short,
they both form distinct families; which, though so seem∣ingly near, are
still remote; and although with the same habitudes, yet retain an
unal∣terable aversion.</P>
<P>The fallow deer, as they are much smaller, so they seem of a
nature less robust, and less savage than those of the stag kind.
They are found but rarely wild in the forests; they are, in general, bred up
in parks, and kept for the purposes of hunting, or of luxury, their flesh
being preferred to that of any other animal. It need scarce be mentioned,
that the horns of the buck make its principal distinction, being broad and
palmated; whereas those of the stag <PB N="126" REF="141"/> are in every
part round. In the one, they are flatted and spread like the palm of the
hand; in the other they grow like a tree, every branch being of the shape of
the stem that bears it. The fallow deer also has the tail longer, and the
hair lighter than the stag; in other re∣spects, they pretty nearly
resemble one another.</P>
<P>The head of the buck, as of all other ani∣mals of this kind, is
shed every year, and takes the usual time for repairing. The only
differ∣ence between it and the stag is, that this change happens later in the
buck; and its rut∣ting-time, consequently, falls more into the winter. It is
not found so furious at this season as the former; nor does it so much
ex∣haust itself by the violence of its ardour. It does not quit its natural
pastures in quest of the female, nor does it attack other animals with
indiscriminate ferocity: however, the males combat for the female among each
other; and it is not without many contests, that one buck is seen to become
master of the whole herd.</P>
<P>It often happens also, that an herd of fallow deer is seen to
divide into two parties, and en∣gage each other with great ardour and
ob∣stinacy<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon, vol. xii. p.
36.</BIBL></NOTE>. They both seem desirous of gaining some favourite
spot of the park for pasture, <PB N="127" REF="142"/> and of driving the
vanquished party into the coarser and more disagreeable parts. Each of
these factions has its particular chief; namely, the two oldest and
strongest of the herd. These lead on to the engagement; and the rest
follow under their direction. These combats are sin∣gular enough, from the
disposition and conduct which seems to regulate their mutual efforts.
They attack with order, and support the assault with courage; they come
to each other's assistance, they retire, they rally, and never give up
the victory upon a single defeat. The combat is renewed for several days
together; until at length the most feeble side is obliged to give way, and
is content to escape to the most disagreeable part of the park, where
only they can find safety and protection.</P>
<P>The fallow deer is easily tamed, and feeds upon many things
which the stag refuses. By this means it preserves its venison better;
and even after rutting, it does not appear entirely exhausted. It continues
almost in the same state through the whole year, although there are
particular seasons when its flesh is chiefly in esteem. This animal
also browzes closer than the stag; for which reason it is more
pre∣judicial among young trees, which it often strips too close for
recovery. The young deer <PB N="128" REF="143"/> eat much faster and more
greedily than the old; they seek the female at their second year, and, like
the stag, are fond of variety. The doe goes with young above eight months,
like the hind; and commonly brings forth one at a time: but they differ in
this, that the buck comes to perfection at three, and lives till six∣teen;
whereas the stag does not come to per∣fection till seven, and lives till
forty.</P>
<P>As this animal is a beast of chace, like the stag, so the
hunters have invented a number of names relative to him. The buck is the
first year called a <HI>fawn</HI>; the second, a <HI>pricket</HI>; the
third, a <HI>sorel</HI>; the fourth, a <HI>sore</HI>; the fifth, a <HI>buck
of the first head</HI>; and the sixth, a <HI>great buck</HI>: The female is
called a <HI>doe</HI>; the first year a <HI>fawn</HI>; and the second a
<HI>tegg.</HI> The manner of hunting the buck is pretty much the same as that
of stag hunting, except that less skill is re∣quired in the latter. The
buck is more easily rouzed; it is sufficient to judge by the view, and mark
what grove or covert it enters, as it is not known to wander far from thence;
nor, like the stag, to change his <HI>layer,</HI> or place of repose. When
hard hunted, it takes to some strong hold or covert with which it is
ac∣quainted, in the more gloomy parts of the wood, or the steeps of the
mountain; not like <PB N="129" REF="144"/> the stag, flying far before the
hounds, nor crossing nor doubling, nor using any of the subtleties
which the stag is accustomed to. It will take the water when sorely
pressed, but seldom a great river; nor can it swim so long, nor so
swiftly, as the former. In general, the strength, the cunning, and the
courage of this animal, are inferior to those of the stag; and,
consequently, it affords neither so long, so va∣rious, nor so
obstinate a chace: besides, being lighter, and not tracking so deeply, it
leaves a less powerful and lasting scent, and the dogs in the pursuit
are more frequently at a fault.</P>
<P>As the buck is a more delicate animal than the stag, so also
is it subject to greater varieties<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>British
Zoology.</BIBL></NOTE>. We have in England two varieties of the fallow-deer,
which are said to be of foreign origin. The beautiful spotted kind, which
is supposed to have been brought from Bengal; and the very deep brown
sort, that are now so common in several parts of this kingdom. These
were introduced by king James the First, from Nor∣way: for having observed
their hardiness, and that they could endure the winter, even in that severe
climate, without fodder, he brought over some of them into Scotland, and
disposed of them among his chaces. Since that time, they have 
<PB N="130" REF="145"/> multiplied in many parts of the British em∣pire; and
England is now become more fa∣mous for its venison, than any other country in
the world. Whatever pains the French have taken to rival us in this particular,
the flesh of their fallow-deer, of which they keep but a few, has neither the
fatness nor the flavour of that fed upon English pasture.</P>
<P>However, there is scarce a country in Europe, except far to the
northward, in which this ani∣mal is a stranger. The Spanish fallow-deer are
as large as stags, but of a darker colour, and a more slender neck: their
tails are longer than those of ours, they are black above, and white below.
The Virginian deer are larger and stronger than ours, with great necks, and
their colour inclinable to grey. Other kinds have the hoofs of their hind legs
marked out∣wardly with a white spot; and their ears and tails much longer
than the common. One of these has been seen full of white spots, with a
black list down the middle of his back. In Guiana, a country of South
America, according to Labat, there are deer without horns, which are much
less than those of Europe, but re∣sembling them in every other
particular. They are very lively, light of course, and excessively
fearful; their hair is of a reddish sallow, their <PB N="131" REF="146"/>
heads are small and lean, their ears little, their necks long and arched, the
tail short, and the sight piercing. When pursued, they fly into places
where no other animal can follow them. The Negroes, who pursue them, stand
to watch for them in narrow paths, which lead to the brook or the meadow where
they feed; there waiting in the utmost silence, for the slightest
sound will drive them away, the Negroe, when he perceives the animal within
reach, shoots, and is happy if he can bring down his game. Their flesh,
though seldom fat, is considered as a great delicacy, and the hunter is
well rewarded for his trouble.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>THE ROE-BUCK.</HEAD>
<P>THE Roe-buck is the smallest of the deer kind known in our
climate, and is now almost extinct among us, except in some parts of the
highlands of Scotland. It is generally about three feet long, and about two
feet high. The horns are from eight to nine inches long, up∣right, round, and
divided into only three branches. The body is covered with very long hair, well
adapted to the rigour of its mountainous abode. The lower part of each hair is
ash colour; near the ends is a narrow <PB N="132" REF="147"/> bar of black,
and the points are yellow. The hairs on the face are black, tipped with ash
colour. The ears are long, their insides of a pale yellow, and covered with
long hair. The spaces bordering on the eyes and mouth, are black. The
chest, belly, and legs, and the in∣side of the thighs, are of a yellowish
white; the rump is of a pure white, and the tail very short. The make of this
little animal is very elegant; and its swiftness equals its beauty. It
differs from the fallow-deer, in having round horns, and not flatted like
theirs. It differs from the stag, in its smaller size, and the
pro∣portionable paucity of its antlers: and it differs from all of the goat
kind, as it annually sheds its head, and obtains a new one, which none of
that kind are ever seen to do.</P>
<P>As the stag frequents the thickest forests, and the sides
of the highest mountains, the roe∣buck, with humbler ambition, courts the
shady thicket, and the rising slope. Although less in size, and far
inferior in strength to the stag, it is yet more beautiful, more active,
and even more courageous. Its hair is always smooth, clean, and glossy;
and it frequents only the dryest places, and of the purest air. Though but
a very little animal, as we have already observed, yet, when its young is
attacked, it <PB N="133" REF="148"/> faces even the stag himself, and often
comes off victorious<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon, vol. xii. p.
75.</BIBL></NOTE>. All its motions are elegant and easy; it bounds without
effort, and con∣tinues the course with but little fatigue. It is also
possessed of more cunning in avoiding the hunter, is more difficult to
pursue, and, al∣though its scent is much stronger than that of the
stag, it is more frequently found to make good a retreat. It is not with the
roe-buck, as with the stag, who never offers to use art until his
strength is beginning to decline; this more cunning animal, when it finds
that its first efforts to escape are without success, re∣turns upon its
former track, again goes for∣ward, and again returns, until by its various
windings it has entirely confounded the scent, and joined the last
emanations to those of its former course. It then, by a bound, goes to one
side, lies flat upon its belly, and permits the pack to pass by very near,
without offering to stir.</P>
<P>But the roe-buck differs not only from the stag in superior
cunning, but also in its natural appetites, its inclinations, and its whole
habits of living. Instead of herding together, these animals live in
separate families; the sire, the dam, and the young ones, associate
together, <PB N="134" REF="149"/> and never admit a stranger into their little
com∣munity. All others of the deer kind are in∣constant in their affection;
but the roe-buck never leaves its mate; and as they have been generally bred up
together, from their first fawning, they conceive so strong an
attach∣ment, the male for the female, that they never after separate. Their
rutting-season continues but fifteen days; from the latter end of October,
to about the middle of November. They are not at that time, like the stag,
overloaded with fat; they have not that strong odour, which is perceived in
all others of the deer kind; they have none of those furious excesses;
nothing, in short, that alters their state: they only drive away their
fawns upon these occasions; the buck forcing them to retire, in order to
make room for a succeeding progeny: however, when the copulating season
is over, the fawns return to their does, and remain with them some time
longer; after which, they quit them entirely, in order to begin an independant
family of their own. The female goes with young but five months and an half;
which alone serves to distinguish this animal from all others of the deer
kind, that continue pregnant more than eight. In this respect, she rather
approaches more nearly to the goat kind; from which, <PB N="135" REF="150"/>
however, this race is separated by the male's annual casting its horns.</P>
<P>When the female is ready to bring forth she seeks a retreat in
the thickest part of the woods, being not less apprehensive of the buck,
from whom she then separates, than of the wolf, the wild cat, and almost
every ravening animal of the forest; she generally produces two at a time,
and three but very rarely. In about ten or twelve days these are able to
follow their dam, except in cases of warm pursuit, when their strength is
not equal to the fatigue. Upon such occasions, the tenderness of the dam
is very extraordinary; leaving them in the deepest thickets, she offers
herself to the danger, flies before the hounds, and does all in her power to
lead them from the retreat where she has lodged her little ones. Such animals
as are nearly upon her own level she boldly encoun∣ters; attacks the stag,
the wild cat, and even the wolf; and while she has life continues her efforts
to protect her young. Yet all her en∣deavours are often vain; about the month
of May, which is her fawning time, there is a greater destruction among
those animals than at any other season of the year. Numbers of the fawns
are taken alive by the peasants; num∣bers are found out, and worried by the
dogs; <PB N="136" REF="151"/> and still more by the wolf, which has always
been their most inveterate enemy. By these continual depredations upon this
beautiful creature, the roe-buck is every day becoming scarcer; and the whole
race in many countries is wholly worn out. They were once common in England;
the huntsmen, who characterised only such beasts as they knew, have
given names to the different kinds and ages, as to the stag: thus they called
it the first year an <HI>hind</HI>; the second, a <HI>gyrle</HI>; and the
third, an <HI>hemuse</HI>; but these names at present are utterly
useless, since the animal no longer exists among us. Even in France,
where it was once ex∣tremely common, it is now confined to a few provinces; and
it is probable that in an age or two the whole breed will be utterly
extirpated. Mr. Buffon, indeed, observes, that in those districts where
it is mostly found, it seems to maintain its usual plenty, and that the
balance between its destruction and encrease is held pretty even; however,
the number in general is known to decrease; for wherever cultivation takes
place, the beasts of nature are known to retire. Many animals that once
flourished in the world may now be extinct; and the descrip∣tions of
Aristotle and Pliny, though taken from life, may be considered as fabulous,
as their archetypes are no longer existing.</P>
<P><PB N="137" REF="152"/>The fawns continue to follow the deer eight
or nine months in all; and upon separating, their horns begin to appear,
simple and without antlers the first year, as in those of the stag
kind<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon, vol. xii. p. 88.</BIBL></NOTE>.
These they shed at the latter end of autumn, and renew during the winter;
differ∣ing in this from the stag, who sheds them in spring and renews
them in summer. When the roe-buck's head is completely furnished, it rubs
the horns against trees in the manner of the stag, and thus strips them
of the rough skin and the blood-vessels, which no longer contribute to
their nourishment and growth. When these fall, and new ones begin to
appear, the roe-buck does not retire as the stag to the covert of the wood,
but continues its usual haunts, only keeping down its head to avoid
striking its horns against the branches of trees, the pain of which it
seems to feel with exquisite sensibility. The stag, who sheds his
horns in summer, is obliged to seek a retreat from the flies, that at that
time greatly incommode him; but the roe-buck, who sheds them in winter, is
under no such necessity; and, consequently, does not separate from
its little family, but keeps with the female all the year round<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon, ibid.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P>As the growth of the roe-buck, and its arrival 
<PB N="138" REF="153"/> at maturity, is much speedier than that of the stag,
so its life is proportionably shorter. It seldom is found to extend above
twelve or fif∣teen years; and if kept tame it does not live above six or
seven. It is an animal of a very de∣licate constitution, requiring variety
of food, air, and exercise. It must be paired with a fe∣male, and kept in a
park of at least an hundred acres. They may easily be subdued, but never
thoroughly tamed. No arts can teach them to be familiar with the feeder, much
less attached to him. They still preserve a part of their natural
wildness, and are subject to terrors without a cause. They sometimes,
in attempt∣ing to escape, strike themselves with such force against
the walls of their inclosure, that they break their limbs, and become utterly
disabled. Whatever care is taken to tame them, they are never entirely to be
relied on, as they have ca∣pricious fits of fierceness, and sometimes
strike at those they dislike with a degree of force that is very
dangerous.</P>
<P>The cry of the roe-buck is neither so loud nor so frequent as
that of the stag. The young ones have a particular manner of calling to the
dam, which the hunters easily imitate, and often thus allure the female to
her destruction. Upon some occasions also they become in a 
<PB N="139" REF="154"/> manner intoxicated with their food, which, during the
spring, is said to ferment in their stomachs, and they are then very
easily taken. In summer they keep close under covert of the forest, and
seldom venture out, except in violent heats, to drink at some river or
foun∣tain. In general, however, they are contented to slake their thirst
with the dew that falls on the grass and the leaves of trees, and seldom
risque their safety to satisfy their appetite. They de∣light chiefly in
hilly grounds, preferring the tender branches and buds of trees to corn, or
other vegetables; and it is universally allowed that the flesh of those
between one and two years old is the greatest delicacy that is known. Perhaps
also, the scarceness of it enhances its flavour.</P>
<P>In America this animal is much more com∣mon than in Europe. With
us there are but two known varieties; the red, which is the larger sort; and
the brown, with a spot behind, which is less. But in the new continent the
breed is extremely numerous, and the varieties in equal proportion. In
Louisiana, where they are ex∣tremely common, they are much larger than in
Europe, and the inhabitants live in a great measure upon its flesh, which
tastes like mut∣ton when well fatted. They are found also in 
<PB N="140" REF="155"/> Brasil, where they have the name of Cuguacu Apara,
only differing from ours in some slight deviations in the horns. This
animal is also said to be common in China; although such as have
described it seem to confound it with the musk-goat, which is of a quite
different nature.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>THE ELK.</HEAD>
<P>WE have hitherto been describing minute animals in comparison
of the Elk; the size of which, from concurrent testimony, appears to be
equal to that of the elephant itself. It is an animal rather of the buck than
the stag kind, as its horns are flatted towards the top; but it is far beyond
both in stature, some of them being known to be above ten feet high. It is
a native both of the old and new continent, being known in Europe under the
name of the Elk, and in America by that of the Moose-deer. It is sometimes
taken in the German and Russian forests, although seldom appear∣ing;
but it is extremely common in North America, where the natives pursue, and
track it in the snow. The accounts of this ani∣mal are extremely various;
some describing it as being no higher than an horse, and others above
twelve feet high.</P>
<P>As the stature of this creature makes its chief <PB REF="156"/>

peculiarity, so it were to be wished that we could come to some
precision upon that head. If we were to judge of its size by the horns,
which are sometimes fortuitously dug up in many parts of Ireland, we
should not be much amiss in ascribing them to an animal at least ten
feet high. One of these I have seen, which was ten feet nine inches from
one tip to the other. From such dimensions, it is easy to perceive that
it required an animal far be∣yond the size of an horse to support them.
To bear an head with such extensive and heavy ant∣lers, required no small
degree of strength; and without all doubt the bulk of the body must have
been proportionable to the size of the horns. I remember, some years ago,
to have seen a small moose-deer, which was brought from America, by a
gentleman of Ireland; it was about the size of an horse, and the horns were
very little larger than those of a common stag: this, therefore, serves
to prove that the horns bear an exact proportion to the animal's size; the
small elk has but small horns; whereas those enormous ones, which we have
described above, must have belonged to a proportionable creature. In all
the more noble animals, na∣ture observes a perfect symmetry; and it is not
to be supposed she fails in this single instance. 
<PB N="142" REF="160"/> We have no reason, therefore, to doubt the accounts of
Jocelyn and Dudley, who affirm, that they have been found fourteen spans;
which, at nine inches to a span, makes the animal almost eleven feet high.
Others have extended their accounts to twelve and fourteen feet, which makes
this creature one of the most formidable of the forest.</P>
<P>There is but very little difference between the European elk, and
the American moose-deer, as they are but varieties of the same animal. It
may be rather larger in America than with us; as in the forests of that
unpeopled country, it receives less disturbance than in our own. In all
places, however, it is timorous and gentle; content with its pasture, and
never willing to disturb any other animal, when sup∣plied itself.</P>
<P>The European elk grows to above seven or eight feet high. In the
year 1742, there was a female of this animal shewn at Paris, which was caught
in a forest of Red Russia, belonging to the Cham of Tartary<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Dictionaire Raisonnée des Animaux. An. Nom
Elan.</BIBL></NOTE>; it was then but young, and its height was even at that
time six feet seven inches; but the describer observes, that it has
since become much taller and thicker, so that we may suppose this
female at least <PB N="143" REF="161"/> seven feet high. There have been no
late op∣portunities of seeing the male; but, by the rule of proportion, we
may estimate his size at eight or nine feet at the least, which is about
twice as high as an ordinary horse. The height, however, of the female, which
was measured, was but six feet seven inches, Paris measure; or almost
seven English feet high. It was ten feet from the tip of the nose to the
insertion of the tail; and eight feet round the body. The hair was very long
and coarse, like that of a wild boar. The ears resembled those of a mule,
and were a foot and an half long. The upper jaw was longer, by six inches,
than the lower; and, like other ruminating animals, it had no teeth (cutting
teeth I suppose the describer means). It had a large beard under the
throat, like a goat; and in the middle of the forehead, between the horns,
there was a bone as large as an egg. The nostrils were four inches long on
each side of the mouth. It made use of its fore feet, as a defence
against its enemies. Those who shewed it, asserted, that it ran with
astonishing swiftness; that it swam also with equal expedition, and
was very fond of the water. They gave it thirty pounds of bread every day,
beside hay, and it drank eight <PB N="144" REF="162"/> buckets of water. It
was tame and familiar, and submissive enough to its keeper.</P>
<P>This description differs in many circum∣stances from that
which we have of the moose, or American elk, which the French call the
Original. Of these there are two kinds, the common light grey moose, which
is not very large; and the black moose, which grows to an enormous height.
Mr. Dudley observes, that a doe or hind of the black moose kind, of the
fourth year, wanted but an inch of seven feet high. All, however, of both
kinds, have flat palmed horns, not unlike the fallow-deer, only that the palm
is much larger, having a short trunk at the head, and then immediately
spread∣ing above a foot broad, with a kind of small antlers, like teeth, on
one of the edges. In this particular, all of the elk kind agree; as well the
European elk, as the grey and the black moose-deer.</P>
<P>The grey moose-deer is about the size of an horse; and
although it has large buttocks, its tail is not above an inch long. As in all
of this kind the upper lip is much longer than the under, it is said that
they continue to go back∣ward as they feed. Their nostrils are so large
that a man may thrust his hand in a considerable <PB N="145" REF="163"/>
way; and their horns are as long as those of a stag, but, as was
observed, much broader.</P>
<P>The black moose is the enormous animal mentioned above, from
eight to twelve feet high. Josseleyn, who is the first English writer
that mentions it, says, that it is a goodly crea∣ture, twelve feet high, with
exceeding fair horns, that have broad palms, two fathoms from the top of one
horn to another. He assures us, that it is a creature, or rather a
monster of superfluity, and many times bigger than an English ox. This
account is confirmed by Dudley; but he does not give so great an ex∣pansion
to the horns, measuring them only thirty-one inches between one tip and the
other: however, that such an extraordinary animal as Josseleyn
describes, has actually existed, we can make no manner of doubt of, since
there are horns common enough to be seen among us, twelve feet from one tip
to the other.</P>
<P>These animals delight in cold countries, feed∣ing upon grass
in summer, and the bark of trees in winter. When the whole country is deeply
covered with snow, the moose-deer herd together under the tall pine-trees,
strip off the bark, and remain in that part of the forest while it yields
them subsistence. It is at that time that the natives prepare to hunt
them; <PB N="146" REF="164"/> and particularly when the sun begins to melt the
snow by day, which is frozen again at night; for then the icy crust which
covers the surface of the snow, is too weak to support so great a bulk,
and only retards the animal's motion. When the Indians, therefore, perceive an
herd of these at a distance, they immediately prepare for their pursuit,
which is not, as with us, the sport of an hour, but is attended with toil,
difficulty, and danger<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Phil. Trans. vol. ii. p.
436.</BIBL></NOTE>. The timorous animal no sooner observes its enemies
approach, than it immediately endeavours to escape, but sinks at every
step it takes. Still, however, it pur∣sues its way through a thousand
obstacles: the snow, which is usually four feet deep, yields to its
weight, and embarrasses its speed; the sharp ice wounds its feet; and
its lofty horns are en∣tangled in the branches of the forest, as it
passes along. The trees, however, are broken down with ease; and wherever
the moose-deer runs, it is perceived by the snapping off the branches of
trees, as thick as a man's thigh, with its horns. The chace lasts in this
manner for the whole day; and sometimes it has been known to continue for
two, nay three days together; for the pursuers are often not less ex∣cited
by famine, than the pursued by fear. <PB N="147" REF="165"/> Their
perseverance, however, generally suc∣ceeds; and the Indian who first
comes near enough, darts his lance, with unerring aim, which sticks in the
poor animal, and at first encreases its efforts to escape. In this manner
the moose trots heavily on, (for that is its usual pace) till its
pursuers once more come up, and repeat their blow: upon this, it again
sum∣mons up sufficient vigour to get an head; but, at last, quite tired,
and spent with loss of blood, it sinks, as the describer expresses
it, like a ruined building, and makes the earth shake beneath its fall.</P>
<P>This animal, when killed, is a very valuable acquisition to the
hunters. The flesh is very well tasted, and said to be very nourishing.
The hide is strong, and so thick that it has been often known to turn a
musket-ball; how∣ever, it is soft and pliable, and, when tanned, the
leather is extremely light, yet very lasting. The fur is a light grey in
some, and blackish in others; and when viewed through a micro∣scope,
appears spongy like a bulrush, and is smaller at the roots and points
than in the middle; for this reason, it lies very flat and smooth, and
though beaten or abused never so much, it always returns to its former
state. The <PB N="148" REF="166"/> horns also are not less useful, being
applied to all the purposes for which hartshorn is bene∣ficial: these are
different in different animals; in some they resemble entirely those of
the European elk, which spread into a broad palm, with small antlers on one
of the edges; in others they have a branched brow-antler between the bur and
the palm, which the German elk has not; and in this they entirely agree with
those whose horns are so frequently dug up in Ireland. This animal is
said to be troubled with the epilepsy, as it is often found to fall down
when pursued, and thus becomes an easier prey; for this reason, an
imaginary virtue has been ascribed to the hinder hoof, which some have
supposed to be a specific against all epileptic disorders. This,
however, may be considered as a vulgar error; as well as that of its curing
itself of this disorder by ap∣plying the hinder hoof behind the ear. After
all, this animal is but very indifferently and confusedly described by
travellers; each mixing his account with something false or trivial; often
mistaking some other quadrupede for the elk, and confounding its history.
Thus some have mistaken it for the rein-deer, which in every thing but
size it greatly resembles; some have supposed it to be the same
with the <PB REF="167"/>

<HEAD>THE REIN-DEER.</HEAD>
<P>OF all animals of the deer kind, the Rein-Deer is the most
extraordinary and the most useful. It is a native of the icy regions of the
north; and though many attempts have been made to accustom it to a more
southern cli∣mate, it shortly feels the influence of the change, and in a
few months declines and dies. Nature seems to have fitted it entirely to
answer the necessities of that hardy race of mankind that live near the
pole. As these would find it impossible to subsist among their
barren snowy mountains without its aid, so this animal can live only there,
where its assistance is most absolutely necessary. From it alone
the natives of Lapland and Greenland supply most of their wants; it
answers the purposes of an horse, to convey them and their scanty
fur∣niture from one mountain to another; it answers <PB REF="169"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/> <PB N="149" REF="170"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/> <PB N="150" REF="171"/> the
purposes of a cow, in giving milk; and it answers the purposes of the
sheep, in furnishing them with a warm, though an homely kind of cloathing.
From this quadrupede alone, there∣fore, they receive as many advantages as we
derive from three of our most useful creatures; so that Providence does
not leave these poor outcasts entirely destitute, but gives them a
faithful domestic, more patient and serviceable than any other in
nature.</P>
<P>The rein-deer resembles the American elk in the fashion of its
horns. It is not easy in words to describe these minute differences; nor
will the reader, perhaps, have a distinct idea of the similitude, when told
that both have brow-antlers, very large, and hanging over their eyes, palmated
towards the top, and bending forward, like a bow. But here the similitude
between these two animals ends; for, as the elk is much larger than the
stag, so the rein-deer is much smaller. It is lower and stronger built
than the stag; its legs are shorter and thicker, and its hoofs much broader
than in that animal; its hair is much thicker and warmer, its horns much larger
in proportion, and branching forward over its eyes; its ears are much larger;
its pace is rather a trot than a bounding, and this it can continue for a whole
<PB N="151" REF="172"/> day; its hoofs are cloven and moveable, so that it
spreads them abroad as it goes, to prevent its sinking in the snow. When
it proceeds on a journey, it lays its great horns on its back, while there are
two branches which always hang over its forehead, and almost cover its face.
One thing seems peculiar to this animal and the elk; which is, that as they
move along, their hoofs are heard to crack with a pretty loud noise. This
arises from their manner of treading; for as they rest upon their cloven
hoof, it spreads on the ground, and the two divisions separate from each
other; but when they lift it, the divisions close again, and strike
against each other with a crack. The female also of the rein-deer has horns
as well as the male, by which the species is distinguished from all other
animals of the deer kind whatsoever.</P>
<P>When the rein-deer first shed their coat of hair, they are
brown; but, in proportion as summer approaches, their hair begins to grow
whitish; until, at last, they are nearly grey<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">For
the greatest part of this description of the Rein-Deer, I am obliged to Mr.
Hoffberg; upon whose authority, being a native of Sweden, and an expe∣rienced
naturalist, we may confidently rely.</NOTE>. They are, however, always black
about the eyes. The neck has long hair, hanging down, <PB N="152" REF="173"/>
and coarser than upon any other part of the body. The feet, just at the
insertion of the hoof, are surrounded with a ring of white. The hair in
general stands so thick over the whole body, that if one should attempt
to se∣parate it, the skin will no where appear un∣covered: whenever it
falls also, it is not seen to drop from the root, as in other quadrupedes,
but seems broken short near the bottom; so that the lower part of the
hair is seen growing, while the upper falls away.</P>
<P>The horns of the female are made like those of the male, except
that they are smaller and less branching. As in the rest of the deer
kind, they sprout from the points; and also in the beginning, are
furnished with an hairy crust, which supports the blood-vessels, of
most exquisite sensibility. The rein-deer shed their horns, after
rutting-time, at the latter end of November; and they are not completely
fur∣nished again till towards autumn. The female always retains hers till
she brings forth, and then sheds them, about the beginning of No∣vember. If
she be barren, however, which is not unfrequently the case, she does not
shed them till winter. The castration of the rein-deer does not prevent the
shedding of their horns: those which are the strongest, cast them 
<PB N="153" REF="174"/> early in winter; those which are more weakly, not so
soon. Thus, from all these, circum∣stances, we see how greatly this
animal differs from the common stag. The female of the rein-deer has horns,
which the hind is never seen to have; the rein-deer, when castrated, renews
its horns, which we are assured the stag never does: it differs not
less in its habits and manner of living, being tame, submissive, and
patient; while the stag is wild, capricious, and unmanageable.</P>
<P>The rein-deer, as was said, is naturally an inhabitant of the
countries bordering on the arctic circle. It is not unknown to the natives of
Siberia. The North Americans also hunt it, under the name of the
<HI>caribou.</HI> But in Lap∣land, this animal is converted to the utmost
advantage; and some herdsmen of that country are known to possess
above a thousand in a single herd.</P>
<P>Lapland is divided into two districts, the moun∣tainous and the
woody. The mountainous part of the country is at best barren and bleak,
exces∣sively cold, and uninhabitable during the winter; still, however,
it is the most desireable part of this frightful region, and is most
thickly peopled during the summer. The natives ge∣nerally reside on the
declivity of the mountains, <PB N="154" REF="175"/> three or four cottages
together, and lead a chearful and a social life. Upon the approach of winter,
they are obliged to migrate into the plains below, each bringing down his whole
herd, which often amounts to more than a thousand, and leading them where the
pasture is in greatest plenty. The woody part of the country is much more
desolate and hideous. The whole face of nature there presents a fright∣ful
scene of trees without fruit, and plains without verdure. As far as the eye
can reach, nothing is to be seen, even in the midst of summer, but barren
fields, covered only with a moss, almost as white as snow; no grass, no
flowery landscapes, only here and there a pine-tree, which may have escaped
the frequent conflagrations by which the natives burn down their forests. But
what is very extra∣ordinary, as the whole surface of the country is cloathed
in white, so, on the contrary, the forests seem to the last degree dark
and gloomy. While one kind of moss makes the fields look as if they were
covered with snow, another kind blackens over all the trees, and even hides
their verdure. This moss, however, which deforms the country, serves for
its only support, as upon it alone the rein-deer can subsist. The
inhabitants, who, during the sum∣mer, <PB N="155" REF="176"/> lived among the
mountains, drive down their herds in winter, and people the plains and woods
below. Such of the Laplanders as inhabit the woods and the plains all the year
round, live remote from each other, and having been used to solitude, are
melancholy, igno∣rant, and helpless. They are much poorer also than the
mountaineers, for, while one of those is found to possess a thousand
rein-deer at a time, none of these are ever known to rear the tenth part of
that number. The rein-deer makes the riches of this people; and the cold
mountainy parts of the country agree best with its constitution. It is for
this reason, therefore, that the mountains of Lapland are preferred to the
woods; and that many claim an exclusive right to the tops of hills, covered
in almost eternal snow.</P>
<P>As soon as the summer begins to appear, the Laplander who had
fed his rein-deer upon the lower grounds, during the winter, then drives them
up to the mountains, and leaves the woody country, and the low pasture, which
at that season are truly deplorable. The gnats, bred, by the sun's heat,
in the marshy bottoms, and the weedy lakes, with which the country abounds
more than any other part of the world, are all upon the wing, and fill the
whole air, <PB N="156" REF="177"/> like clouds of dust in a dry windy day. The
inhabitants, at that time, are obliged to daub their faces with pitch, mixed
with milk, to shield their skins from their depredations. All places are
then so greatly infested, that the poor natives can scarce open their
mouths without fear of suffocation; the insects enter, from their numbers
and minuteness, into the nostrils and the eyes, and do not leave the
sufferer a mo∣ment at his ease. But they are chiefly enemies to the
rein-deer: the horns of that animal being then in their tender state, and
possessed of extreme sensibility, a famished cloud of in∣sects
instantly settle upon them, and drive the poor animal almost to
distraction. In this ex∣tremity, there are but two remedies, to which the
quadrupede, as well as its master, are ob∣liged to have recourse. The one
is, for both to take shelter near their cottage, where a large fire of tree
moss is prepared, which filling the whole place with smoke, keeps off the
gnat, and thus, by one inconvenience, expels a greater; the other is, to
ascend to the highest summit of the mountains, where the air is too thin,
and the weather too cold, for the gnats to come. There the rein-deer are seen
to continue the whole day, although without food, rather than to venture down
into the lower parts, <PB N="157" REF="178"/> where they can have no defence
against their unceasing persecutors.</P>
<P>Besides the gnat, there is also a gadfly, that, during the
summer season, is no less formidable to them. This insect is bred
under their skins, where the egg has been deposed the preceding summer;
and it is no sooner produced as a fly, than it again endeavours to deposite
its eggs in some place similar to that from whence it came. Whenever,
therefore, it appears flying over an herd of rein-deer, it puts the whole body,
how numerous soever, into motion; they know their enemy, and do all they can,
by tossing their horns, and running among each other, to terrify or avoid
it. All their en∣deavours, however, are too generally without effect; the
gadfly is seen to deposite its eggs, which burrowing under the skin,
wound it in several places, and often bring on an incurable disorder.</P>
<P>In the morning, therefore, as soon as the Lapland herdsman
drives his deer to pasture, his greatest care is to keep them from
scaling the summits of the mountains where there is no food, but where they
go merely to be at ease from the gnats and gadflies that are ever annoying
them. At this time, there is a strong contest between the dogs and the
deer; the one <PB N="158" REF="179"/> endeavouring to climb up against the
side of the hill, and to gain those summits that are co∣vered in eternal
snows; the other, forcing them down, by barking and threatening, and, in a
manner, compelling them into the places where their food is in the greatest
plenty. There the men and dogs confine them; guarding them with the utmost
precaution the whole day, and driving them home at the proper seasons for
milking.</P>
<P>The female brings forth in the middle of May, and gives milk till
about the middle of October. Every morning and evening, during the summer,
the herdsman returns to the cottage with his deer to be milked, where the
women previously have kindled up a smoky fire, which effectually drives off
the gnats, and keeps the rein-deer quiet while milking. The fe∣male furnishes
about a pint, which, though thinner than that of the cow, is, nevertheless,
sweeter and more nourishing. This done, the herdsman drives them back to
pasture; as he neither folds nor houses them, neither provides for their
subsistence during the winter, nor im∣proves their pasture by
cultivation.</P>
<P>Upon the return of the winter, when the gnats and flies are no
longer to be feared, the Laplander descends into the lower grounds; 
<PB N="159" REF="180"/> and, as there are but few to dispute the
possession of that desolate country, he has an extensive range to
feed them in. Their chief and almost their only food at that time, is the
white moss already mentioned; which, from its being fed upon by this animal,
obtains the name of the <HI>lichen rangiferinus.</HI> This is of two kinds: the
woody lichen, which covers almost all the desert parts of the country like
snow; the other is black, and covers the branches of the trees in very great
quantities. However unpleasing these may be to the spectator, the native
esteems them as one of his choicest benefits, and the most indulgent gift
of nature. While his fields are cloathed with moss, he envies neither the
fertility nor the verdure of the more southern landscape; dressed up
warmly in his deer-skin cloaths, with shoes and gloves of the same
ma∣terials, he drives his herds along the desert; fearless and at ease,
ignorant of any higher lux∣ury than what their milk and smoke dried flesh
afford him. Hardened to the climate, he sleeps in the midst of ice; or
awaking, dozes away his time with tobacco; while his faithful dogs sup∣ply
his place, and keep the herd from wander∣ing. The deer, in the mean time, with
instincts adapted to the soil, pursue their food, though covered in the
deepest snow. They turn it up <PB N="160" REF="181"/> with their noses,
like swine; and even though its surface be frozen and stiff, yet the hide
is so hardened in that part, that they easily overcome the difficulty. It
sometimes, however, happens, though but rarely, that the winter commences
with rain, and a frost ensuing, covers the whole country with a glazed
crust of ice. Then, in∣deed, both the rein-deer and the Laplander are undone;
they have no provisions laid up in case of accident, and the only
resource is to cut down the large pine-trees, that are covered with moss,
which furnishes but a scanty supply; so that the greatest part of the
herd is then seen to perish, without a possibility of assistance.
It sometimes also happens, that even this supply is wanting; for the
Laplander often burns down his woods, in order to improve and fertilize the
soil which produces the moss, upon which he feeds his cattle.</P>
<P>In this manner the pastoral life is still con∣tinued near the
pole; neither the coldness of the winter, nor the length of the nights,
neither the wildness of the forest, nor the vagrant disposi∣tion of the
herd, interrupt the even tenour of the Laplander's life. By night and day he is
seen attending his favourite cattle, and remains unaffected, in a season
which would be speedy death to those bred up in a milder climate. He 
<PB N="161" REF="182"/> gives himself no uneasiness to house his herds
or to provide a winter subsistence for them; he is at the trouble neither
of manuring his grounds, nor bringing in his harvests; he is not the
hire∣ling of another's luxury; all his labours are to obviate the
necessities of his own situa∣tion; and these he undergoes with
chearfulness, as he is sure to enjoy the fruits of his own in∣dustry. If,
therefore, we compare the Lap∣lander with the peasant of more southern
cli∣mates, we shall have little reason to pity his situation; the climate
in which he lives is ra∣ther terrible to us than to him; and, as for the
rest, he is blessed with liberty, plenty, and ease. The rein-deer alone
supplies him with all the wants of life, and some of the conve∣niencies,
serving to shew how many advantages nature is capable of supplying, when
necessity gives the call. Thus, the poor, little, helpless native, who
was originally, perhaps, driven by fear or famine into those inhospitable
cli∣mates, would seem, at first view, to be the most wretched of mankind:
but it is far other∣wise, he looks round among the few wild ani∣mals that his
barren country can maintain, and singles out one from among them, and that of
a kind which the rest of mankind have not thought worth taking from a state
of nature; <PB N="162" REF="183"/> this he cultivates, propagates, and
multiplies, and from this alone derives every comfort that can soften the
severity of his situation.</P>
<P>The rein-deer of this country are of two kinds, the wild and the
tame. The wild are larger and stronger, but more mischievous than the
others. Their breed, however, is pre∣ferred to that of the tame; and the female
of the latter is often sent into the woods, from whence she returns home
impregnated by one of the wild kind. These are fitter for drawing the
sledge, to which the Laplander accustoms them betimes, and yoaks them to it
by a strap, which goes round the neck, and comes down between their legs. The
sledge is extremely light, and shod at the bottom, with the skin of a
young deer, the hair turned to slide on the frozen snow. The person who
sits on this guides the animal with a cord, fastened round the horns, and
encourages it to proceed with his voice, and drives it with a goad. Some of the
wild breed, though by far the strongest, are yet found re∣fractory, and
often turn upon their drivers; who have then no other resource but to cover
them∣selves with their sledge, and let the animal vent its fury upon that.
But it is otherwise with those that are tame; no creature can be more
active, patient, and willing: when hard pushed, <PB N="163" REF="184"/> they
will trot nine or ten Swedish miles, or between fifty and sixty English
miles, at one stretch. But, in such a case, the poor obe∣dient creature
fatigues itself to death; and, if not prevented by the Laplander, who kills
it immediately, it will die a day or two after. In general, they can go about
thirty miles without halting, and this without any great or dangerous efforts.
This, which is the only manner of travelling in that country, can be performed
only in winter, when the snow is glazed over with ice; and although it be a
very speedy me∣thod of conveyance, yet it is inconvenient, dangerous, and
troublesome.</P>
<P>In order to make these animals more obe∣dient, and more
generally serviceable, they castrate them; which operation the Laplanders
perform with their teeth; these become sooner fat when taken from labour;
and they are found to be stronger in drawing the sledge. There is usually
one male left entire for every six fe∣males; these are in rut from the
Feast of St. Matthew to about Michaelmas. At this time, their horns are
thoroughly burnished, and their battles among each other are fierce and
obsti∣nate. The females do not begin to breed till they are two years old;
and then they continue regularly breeding every year till they are
su∣perannuated. <PB N="164" REF="185"/> They go with young above eight months,
and generally bring forth two at a time. The fondness of the dam for her
young is very remarkable; it often happens that when they are separated from
her, she will return from pasture, keep calling round the cottage for them,
and will not desist until, dead or alive, they are brought and laid at her
feet. They are at first of a light brown; but they become darker with age;
and at last the old ones are of a brown almost approaching to blackness.
The young follow the dam for two or three years; but they do not acquire their
full growth until four. They are then broke in, and managed for drawing the
sledge; and they continue serviceable for four or five years longer. They
never live above fifteen or sixteen years; and, when they arrive at the
proper age, the Laplander generally kills them for the sake of their skins
and their flesh. This he performs by striking them on the back of the neck,
with his knife, into the spinal marrow; upon which they instantly fall, and
he then cuts the arteries that lead to the heart, and lets the blood
dis∣charge itself into the cavity of the breast.</P>
<P>There is scarce any part of this animal that is not converted to
its peculiar uses. As soon as it begins to grow old, and some time before
<PB N="165" REF="186"/> the rut, it is killed, and the flesh dried in the air.
It is also sometimes hardened with smoke, and laid up for travelling
provision, when the natives migrate from one part of the country to another.
During the winter, the rein-deer are slaughter'd as sheep with us; and
every four persons in the family are allowed one rein-deer for their week's
subsistence. In spring, they spare the herd as much as they can, and
live upon fresh fish. In summer, the milk and curd of the rein-deer makes
their chief provi∣sion; and, in autumn, they live wholly upon fowls, which
they kill with a cross-bow, or catch in springes. Nor is this so scanty
an al∣lowance; since, at that time, the sea-fowls come in such abundance
that their ponds and springs are covered over. These are not so shy as
with us, but yield themselves an easy prey. They are chiefly allured to
those places by the swarms of gnats which infest the country during
summer, and now repay the former inconve∣niencies, by inviting such numbers
of birds as supply the natives with food a fourth part of the year, in great
abundance.</P>
<P>The milk, when newly taken, is warmed in a cauldron, and thickened
with rennet, and then the curd is pressed into cheeses, which are little
and well tasted. These are never found to <PB N="166" REF="187"/> breed
mites as the cheese of other countries, probably because the mite fly is
not to be found in Lapland. The whey which remains is warmed up again, and
becomes of a consistence as if thickened with the white of eggs. Upon this
the Laplanders feed during the summer; it is pleasant and well tasted,
but not very nou∣rishing. As to butter they very seldom make any, because
the milk affords but a very small quantity, and this, both in taste and
consistence, is more nearly resembling to suet. They never keep their
milk till it turns sour; and do not dress it into the variety of dishes
which the more southern countries are known to do. The only delicacy they
make from it is with wood sorrel, which being boiled up with it, and
coagulating, the whole is put into casks, or deer-skins, and kept under
ground to be eaten in winter.</P>
<P>The skin is even a more valuable part of this animal than either
of the former. From that part of it which covered the head and feet, they make
their strong snow shoes with the hair on the outside. Of the other
parts they compose their garments, which are extremely warm, and which cover
them all over. The hair of these also is on the outside; and they
sometimes line them within with the fur of the Glutton, or some other warm
furr'd animal of that cli∣mate. <PB N="167" REF="188"/> These skins also
serve them for beds. They spread them on each side of the fire, upon the
leaves of the dwarf birch-tree, and in this manner lie both soft and warm.
Many gar∣ments, made of the skin of the rein deer, are so<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ery year to the inhabitants of the
more southern parts of Europe; and they are found so serviceable in
keeping out the cold, that even people of the first rank are known to wear
them.</P>
<P>In short, no part of this animal is thrown away as useless
The blood is preserved in small casks, to make sauce with the marrow in
spring. The horns are sold to be converted into glue. The sinews are
dried, and divided so as to make the strongest kind of sowing thread,
not unlike catgut. The tongues, which are considered as a great delicacy, are
dried, and sold into the more southern provinces. The intestines
themselves are washed like our tripe, and in high esteem among the
natives. Thus the Laplander finds all his necessities amply supplied from
this single animal; and he who has a large herd of these animals has no
idea of higher luxury.</P>
<P>But, although the rein-deer be a very hardy and vigorous animal,
it is not without its dis∣eases. I have already mentioned the pain it 
<PB N="168" REF="189"/> feels from the gnat, and the apprehensions it is under
from the gad-fly. Its hide is often found pierced in an hundred places, like a
sieve, from this insect, and not a few die in their third year, from this
very cause Their teats also are subject to cracking, so that blood
comes instead of milk. They sometimes take a loathing for their food; and,
instead of eating, stand still, and chew the cud. They are also
troubled with a vertigo, like the elk, and turn round often till they die. The
Laplander judges of their state by the manner of their turning. If they turn
to the right, he judges their disorder but slight; if they turn to the
left, he deems it incurable. The rein-deer are also subject to ulcers near
the hoof, which unqualifies them for travelling, or keeping with the herd. But
the most fatal disorder of all is that which the na∣tives call the
suddataka, which attacks this ani∣mal at all seasons of the year. The
instant it is seized with this disease it begins to breathe with
greater difficulty, its eyes begin to stare, and its nostrils to expand. It
acquires also an un∣usual degree of ferocity, and attacks all it meets
indiscriminately. Still, however, it continues to feed as if in health, but
is not seen to chew the cud, and it lies down more frequently than before. In
this manner it continues, every day <PB N="169" REF="190"/> consuming and
growing more lean, till at last it dies from mere inanition; and not one of
these that are attacked with this disorder are ever found to recover.
Notwithstanding, it is but very lately known in that part of the world;
although, during the last ten or fifteen years, it has spoiled whole
provinces of this necessary creature. It is contagious; and the moment the
Laplander perceives any of his herd infected, he hastens to kill them
immediately, before it spreads any farther. When examined internally, there
is a frothy substance found in the brain, and round the lungs; the
intestines are lax and flabby, and the spleen is diminished almost to
nothing. The Laplander's only cure in all these disorders, is to anoint the
animal's back with tar; if this does not succeed, he considers the
disease as beyond the power of art; and, with his natural phlegm, submits
to the seve∣rities of fortune.</P>
<P>Besides the internal maladies of this animal there are some
external enemies which it has to fear. The bears now and then make
depreda∣tions upon the herd; but of all their persecu∣tors, the creature
called the Glutton is the most dangerous and the most successful. The
war between these is carried on not less in Lapland than in North America,
where the rein-deer is <PB N="170" REF="191"/> called the Caribow, and the
Glutton the Carca∣jou. This animal, which is not above the size of a badger,
waits whole weeks together for its prey, hid in the branches of some
spreading tree; and when the wild rein-deer passes under∣neath, it
instantly drops down upon it, fixing its teeth and claws into the neck,
just behind the horns. It is in vain that the wounded ani∣mal then flies for
protection, that it rustles among the branches of the forest, the Glutton
still holds its former position; and, although it often loses a part of
its skin and flesh, which are rubbed off against the trees, yet it
still keeps fast, until its prey drops with fatigue and loss of blood.
The deer has but one only method of escape, which is by jumping into the
water; that element its enemy cannot endure; for, as we are told, it quits its
hold immediately, and then thinks only of providing for its own pro∣per
security.</P>

<PB N="171" REF="192"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. VI. Of Quadrupedes of the Hog Kind.</HEAD>
<P>ANIMALS of the hog kind seem to unite in themselves all those
distinctions by which others are separated. They resemble those of the
horse kind in the number of their teeth, which in all amount to forty-four,
in the length of their head, and in having but a single sto∣mach. They
resemble the cow kind in their cloven hoofs and the position of their
intestines; and they resemble those of the claw-footed kind in their
appetite for flesh, in their not chewing the cud, and in their numerous
progeny. Thus this species serves to fill up that chasm which is found
between the carnivorous kinds and those that live upon grass; being
possessed of the ravening appetite of the one, and the inof∣fensive
nature of the other. We may consider them, therefore, as of a middle nature,
which we can refer neither to the rapacious nor the peaceful kinds, and yet
partaking somewhat of the nature of both. Like the rapacious kinds, they are
found to have short intestines; their hoofs also, though cloven to the
sight, will, upon anatomical inspection, appear to be sup∣plied with
bones like beasts of prey; and the <PB N="172" REF="193"/> number of their
teats also encrease the simili∣tude: on the other hand, in a natural
state they live upon vegetables, and seldom seek after animal food,
except when urged by ne∣cessity. They offend no other animal of the
forest at the same time that they are furnished with arms to terrify the
bravest.</P>
<P>The Wild Boar, which is the original of all the varieties we find in
this creature, is by no means so stupid nor so filthy an animal as that
we have reduced to tameness; he is much smaller than the tame hog, and does
not vary in his colour as those of the domestic kind do, but is always
found of an iron grey, inclining to black; his snout is much longer than that
of the tame hog, and the ears are shorter, rounder, and black; of which
colour are also the feet and the tail. He roots the ground in a different
manner from the common hog; for as this turns up the earth in little spots
here and there, so the wild boar plows it up like a furrow, and does
irreparable damage in the cultivated lands of the farmer. The tusks also of
this animal are larger than in the tame breed, some of them being seen
almost a foot long<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon, vol. ix. p.
147.</BIBL></NOTE>. These, as is well known, grow from both the under and
upper jaw, bend upwards circu∣larly, <PB N="173" REF="194"/> and are exceeding
sharp at the points. They differ from the tusks of the elephant in this,
that they never fall; and it is remarkable of all the hog kind, that they never
shed their teeth as other animals are seen to do. The tusks of the lower
jaw are always the most to be dreaded, and are found to give very terrible
wounds.</P>
<P>The wild boar can properly be called neither a solitary nor a
gregarious animal. The three first years the whole litter follows the sow,
and the family lives in a herd together. They are then called beasts of
company, and unite their common forces against the invasions of the wolf,
or the more formidable beasts of prey. Upon this their principal safety
while young depends, for when attacked they give each other mutual
assistance, calling to each other with a very loud and fierce note; the
strongest face the dan∣ger; they form a ring, and the weakest fall into
the center. In this position few ravenous beasts dare venture to attack
them, but pursue the chace where there is less resistance and danger.
How∣ever, when the wild boar is come to a state of maturity, and when
conscious of his own su∣perior strength, he then walks the forest
alone, and fearless. At that time he dreads no single creature, nor does he
turn out of his way even <PB N="174" REF="195"/> for man himself. He does not
seek danger, and he does not much seem to avoid it.</P>
<P>This animal is therefore seldom attacked, but at a disadvantage,
either by numbers, or when found sleeping by moon-light. The hunting the wild
boar is one of the principal amuse∣ments of the nobility in those countries
where it is to be found. The dogs provided for this sport are of the slow
heavy kind. Those used for hunting the stag, or the roe-buck, would be
very improper, as they would too soon come up with their prey; and, instead
of a chace, would only furnish out an engagement. A small mastiff is
therefore chosen; nor are the hunters much mindful of the goodness of their
nose, as the wild boar leaves so strong a scent, that it is
impossible for them to mistake its course. They never hunt any but the
largest and the oldest, which are known by their tracks. When the boar is
<HI>rear'd,</HI> as is the expression for driving him from his covert, he
goes slowly and uniformly forward, not much afraid, nor very far before his
pursuers. At the end of every half mile, or thereabouts, he turns round,
stops till the hounds come up, and offers to at∣tack them. These, on the
other hand, know∣ing their danger, keep off, and bay him at a distance. After
they have for a while gazed <PB N="175" REF="196"/> upon each other, with mutual
animosity, the boar again slowly goes on his course, and the dogs renew
their pursuit. In this manner the charge is sustained, and the chace
continues till the boar is quite tired, and refuses to go any farther. The
dogs then attempt to close in upon him from behind; those which are young,
fierce, and unaccustomed to the chace, are ge∣nerally the foremost, and
often lose their lives by their ardour. Those which are older and better
trained are content to wait until the hun∣ters come up, who strike at him
with their spears, and, after several blows, dispatch or dis∣able him.
The instant the animal is killed, they cut off the testicles, which would
other∣wise give a taint to the flesh; and the hunts∣men celebrate the
victory with their horns.</P>
<P>The hog, in a natural state, is found to feed chiefly upon roots
and vegetables; it seldom attacks any other animal, being content with such
provisions as it procures without danger. Whatever animal happens to die in
the forest, or is so wounded that it can make no resistance, becomes a
prey to the hog, who seldom refuses animal food, how putrid soever,
although it is never at the pains of taking or procuring it alive. For this
reason, it seems a glutton ra∣ther by accident than choice, content with
ve∣getable <PB N="176" REF="197"/> food, and only devouring flesh when
pressed by necessity, and when it happens to offer. Indeed, if we
behold the hog in its do∣mestic state, it is the most sordid and brutal
animal in nature<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon, vol. ix. p.
14.</BIBL></NOTE>. The aukwardness of its form seems to influence its
appetites; and all its sensations are as gross as its shapes are
un∣sightly. It seems possessed only of an insatiable desire of
eating; and seems to make choice only of what other animals find the most
offen∣sive. But we ought to consider that the hog with us is in an
unnatural state, and that it is in a manner compelled to feed in this filthy
manner from wanting that proper nourishment which it finds in the forest.
When in a state of wild∣ness, it is of all other quadrupedes the most
delicate in the choice of what vegetables it shall feed on, and rejects a
greater number than any of the rest. The cow, for instance, as we are
assured by Linnaeus, eats two hundred and se∣venty-six plants, and
rejects two hundred and eighteen; the goat eats four hundred and forty-nine,
and rejects an hundred and twenty-six; the sheep eats three hundred and
eighty seven, and rejects an hundred and forty-one; the horse eats two
hundred and sixty-two, and re∣jects two hundred and twelve; but the hog, 
<PB N="177" REF="198"/> more nice in its provision than any of the former,
eats but seventy-two plants, and rejects an hun∣dred and seventy-one. The
indelicacy of this animal is, therefore, rather in our apprehensions than in
its nature; since we find it makes a very distinguishing choice in the
quality of its food; and if it does not reject animal putrefac∣tion, it may be
because it is abridged in that food which is most wholesome and agreeable
to it in a state of nature. This is certain, that its palate is not
insensible to the difference of eat∣ables; for, where it finds variety, it
will reject the worst, with as distinguishing a taste as any other
quadrupede whatsoever<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>British Zoology, vol.
i. p. 42.</BIBL></NOTE>. In the orchards of peach-trees in North America, where
the hog has plenty of delicious food, it is observed, that it will reject the
fruit that has lain but a few hours on the ground, and continue on the watch
whole hours together for a fresh windfall.</P>
<P>However, the hog is naturally formed in a more imperfect manner than
the other animals that we have rendered domestic around us, less active in
its motions, less furnished with instinct in knowing what to pursue or
avoid. Without attachment, and incapable of instruction, it continues, while
it lives, an useless, or rather a <PB N="178" REF="199"/> rapacious
dependant. The coarseness of its hair, and the thickness of its hide,
together with the thick coat of fat that lies immediately under the skin,
render it insensible to blows, or rough usage. Mice have been known to
burrow in the back of these animals while fat∣tening in the sty<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon.</BIBL></NOTE>, without their seeming to perceive
it. Their other senses seem to be in tolerable perfection; they scent
the hounds at a distance; and, as we have seen, they are not insensible
in the choice of their provisions.</P>
<P>The hog is, by nature, stupid, inactive, and drowsy; if
undisturbed, it would sleep half its time; but it is frequently awaked by
the calls of appetite, which when it has satisfied, it goes to rest again.
Its whole life is thus a round of sleep and gluttony; and if supplied with
sufficient food, it soon grows unfit even for its own ex∣istence; its
flesh becomes a greater load than its legs are able to support, and it
continues to feed lying down, or kneeling, an helpless instance of indulged
sensuality. The only time it seems to have passions of a more active
nature, are, when it is incited by venery, or when the wind blows with any
vehemence. Upon this occasion, it is so agitated as to run violently
towards its sty, screaming horribly at the same time, which seems 
<PB N="179" REF="200"/> to argue that it is naturally fond of a warm cli∣mate.
It appears also to foresee the approach of bad weather, bringing straw to
its sty in its mouth, preparing a bed, and hiding itself from the impending
storm. Nor is it less agitated when it hears any of its kind in
distress: when a hog is caught in a gate, as is often the case, or when
it suffers any of the usual domestic ope∣rations of ringing or spaying,
all the rest are then seen to gather round it, to lend their fruit∣less
assistance, and to sympathize with its suffer∣ings. They have often
also been known to gather round a dog that had teazed them, and kill him upon
the spot.</P>
<P>Most of the diseases of this animal arise from intemperance;
measles, imposthumes, and scro∣phulous swellings, are reckoned among
the number. It is thought by some that they wal∣low in the mire to destroy
a sort of louse or in∣sect that is often found to infest them; however,
they are generally known to live, when so per∣mitted, to eighteen or twenty
years; and the females produce till the age of fifteen. As they produce from
ten to twenty young at a litter, and that twice a year, we may easily compute
how numerous they would shortly become, if not diminished by human
industry. In the wild state they are less prolific; and the sow of the 
<PB N="180" REF="201"/> woods brings forth but once a year, probably because
exhausted by rearing up her former numerous progeny.</P>
<P>It would be superfluous to dwell longer upon the nature and
qualities of an animal too well known to need a description: there are few,
even in cities, who are unacquainted with its uses, its appetites, and way of
living. The arts of fattening, rearing, guarding, and ma∣naging hogs, fall more
properly under the cognizance of the farmer than the naturalist; they make a
branch of domestic oeconomy, which, properly treated, may be extended to a
great length: but the history of nature ought always to end where that of art
begins. It will be sufficient, therefore, to observe that the wild boar was
formerly a native of our country, as appears from the laws of Hoeldda<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>British Zoology, vol. 1. p. 44.</BIBL></NOTE>, the
famous Welch legislator, who permitted his grand huntsman to chace that
animal from the the middle of November to the beginning of December. William
the Conqueror also pu∣nished such as were convicted of killing the wild
boar in his forests, with the loss of their eyes. At present, the whole
wild breed is extinct; but no country makes greater use of the tame kinds, as
their flesh, which bears salt better <PB N="181" REF="202"/> than that of
any other animal, makes a principal part of the provisions of the British
Navy.</P>
<P>As this animal is a native of almost every country, there are
some varieties found in the species. That which we call the East-India
breed, is lower, less furnished with hair, is usually black, and has the
belly almost touching the ground; it is now common in England, to fatten more
easily than the ordinary kinds, and to make better bacon.</P>
<P>There is a remarkable variety of this animal about Upsal<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Amaenit Accad. vol. v. p. 465.</BIBL></NOTE>,
which is single hoofed, like the horse; but in no other respect differing
from the common kinds. The authority of Aristotle, who first made mention
of this kind, has been often called in question; some have asserted,
that such a quadrupede never existed, because it happened not to fall
within the sphere of their own confined observation; however, at present,
the animal is too well known to admit of any doubt concerning it. The hog
common in Guinea differs also in some things from our own: though shaped
exactly as ours, it is of a reddish colour, with long ears, which end in a
sharp point, and a tail which hangs down to the pas∣tern; the whole body is
covered with short red shining hair, without any bristles, but pretty 
<PB N="182" REF="203"/> long near the tail. Their flesh is said to be
ex∣cellent, and they are very tame.</P>
<P>All these, from their near resemblance to the hog, may be
considered as of the same species; the East-Indian hog, we well know,
breeds with the common kind; whether the same ob∣tains between it, and
those of Upsal and Guinea, we cannot directly affirm; but where the
ex∣ternal similitude is so strong, we may be induced to believe, that the
appetites and habits are the same. It is true, we are told, that the Gui∣nea
breed will not mix with ours, but keep separate, and herd only together:
however, this is no proof of their diversity, since every animal will
prefer its own likeness in its mate; and they will only then mix with another
sort, when deprived of the society of their own. These, therefore, we may
consider as all of the hog kind; but there are other quadrupedes, that, in
general, resemble this species, which, never∣theless, are very distinct
from them. Travellers, indeed, from their general form, or from their habits
and way of living, have been content to call these creatures hogs also; but
upon a closer inspection, their differences are found to be such as
entirely to separate the kinds, and make each a distinct animal by
itself.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<PB N="183" REF="204"/>
<HEAD>THE PECCARY, OR TAJACU.</HEAD>
<P>THAT animal which of all others most re∣sembles an hog, and
yet is of a formation very distinct from it, is called the Peccary, or
Tajacu. It is a native of America, and found there, in such numbers, that
they are seen in herds of several hundreds together, grazing among the
woods, and inoffensive, except when offended.</P>
<P>The Peccary at first view resembles a small hog; the form of
its body, the shape of its head, the length of its snout, and the form of
its legs, are entirely alike: however, when we come to examine it nearer, the
differences begin to appear. The body is not so bulky; its legs not so
long; its bristles much thicker and stronger than those of the hog,
resembling rather the quills of a porcupine, than hair; instead of a tail,
it has only got a little fleshy protuberance, which does not even cover its
posteriors; but that which is still more extraordinary, and in which it
differs from all other quadrupedes whatsoever, is, that it has got upon its
back a lump resembling the navel in other animals which is found to
separate a liquor of a very strong smell. The Peccary is the only
creature that has those kind of glands which discharge the 
<PB N="184" REF="205"/> musky substance, on that part of its body. Some
have them under the belly, and others under the tail; but this creature, by a
conformation peculiar to itself, has them on its back. This lump, or navel,
is situated on that part of the back which is over the hinder legs; it is, in
general, so covered with long bristles, that it cannot be seen, except
they be drawn aside. A small space then appears, that is almost bare,
and only beset with a few short fine hairs. In the middle it rises like a
lump; and in this there is an orifice, into which one may thrust a common
goose quill. This hole or bag is not above an inch in depth; and round it,
under the skin, are situated a number of small glands, which distil a
whitish liquor, which, in colour and substance, resembles that obtained
from the civet animal. Perhaps it was this analogy, that led Dr. Tyson to
say, that it smelt agreeably also, like that perfume. But this Mr. Buffon
absolutely denies; affirming, that the smell is at every time, and in every
proportion, strong and offensive; and to this I can add my own
testi∣mony, if that able naturalist should want a voucher.</P>
<P>But, to be more particular in the description of the other parts
of this quadrupede; the colour of the body is grizly, and beset with 
<PB N="185" REF="206"/> bristles, thicker and stronger than those of a
common hog; though not near so thick as those of a porcupine, they
resemble, in this respect, that they are variegated with black and white
rings. The belly is almost bare; and the short bristles on the sides,
gradually encrease in length, as they approach the ridge of the back, where
some are five inches long. On the head also, between the ears, there is a
large tuft of bristles, that are chiefly black. The ears are about two inches
and an half long, and stand upright; and the eyes resemble those of a
common hog, only they are smaller. From the lower corner of the eye to the
snout, is usually six inches; and the snout itself is like that of an
hog's, though it is but small. One side of the lower lip is generally
smooth, by the rubbing of the tusk of the upper jaw. The feet and hoofs are
perfectly like those of a common hog; but, as was already observed, it has
no tail. There are some anatomical differences in its internal structure,
from that of the common hog. Dr. Tyson was led to suppose, that it had
three stomachs; whereas the hog has but one: however, in this he was
deceived, as Mr. Daubenton has plainly shewn, that the stomach is only
divided by two closings, which gives it the appearance as if divided into
three; <PB N="186" REF="207"/> and there is no conformation that prevents the
food in any part of it, from going or returning to any other.</P>
<P>The peccary may be tamed like the hog, and has pretty nearly the
same habits and na∣tural inclinations. It feeds upon the same aliments; its
flesh, though drier and leaner than that of the hog, is pretty good eating;
it is improved by castration; and, when killed, not only the parts of
generation must be taken instantly away, but also the navel on the back,
with all the glands that contribute to its supply. If this operation be
deferred for only half an hour, the flesh becomes utterly unfit to be
eaten.</P>
<P>The peccary is extremely numerous in all the parts of Southern
America. They go in herds of two or three hundred together; and unite, like
hogs, in each other's defence. They are particularly fierce when their young
are attemped to be taken from them. They surround the plunderer, attack him
without fear, and frequently make his life pay the forfeit of his rashness.
When any of the natives are pursued by an herd in this manner, they
frequently climb a tree to avoid them; while the peccaries gather round the
root, threaten with their tusks, and their rough bristles standing erect,
as in the <PB N="187" REF="208"/> hog kind, they assume a very terrible
appear∣ance. In this manner they remain at the foot of the tree for hours
together; while the hunter is obliged to wait patiently, and not without
apprehensions, until they think fit to retire.</P>
<P>The peccary is rather fond of the mountain∣ous parts of the
country, than the lowlands; it seems to delight neither in the marshes nor
the mud, like our hogs; it keeps among the woods, where it subsists upon
wild fruits, roots, and vegetables; it is also an unceasing enemy to the
lizard, the toad, and all the serpent kinds, with which these uncultivated
forests abound. As soon as it perceives a serpent, or a viper, it at once
seizes it with its fore hoofs and teeth, skins it in an instant, and
devours the flesh. This is often seen; and may, therefore, be rea∣dily
credited: but as to its applying to a proper vegetable immediately after, as an
antidote to the poison of the animal it had devoured, this part of the
relation we may very well suspect. The flesh, neither of the toad or
viper, as every one now knows, are poisonous; and, therefore, there is no
need of a remedy against their venom. Ray gives no credit to either part of
the account; however, we can have no reason to disbelieve that it feeds
upon toads and serpents; it is only the making use of a vege∣table 
<PB N="188" REF="209"/> antidote, that appears improbable, and which perhaps had
its rise in the ignorance and credulity of the natives.</P>
<P>The peccary, like the hog, is very prolific; the young ones follow
the dam, and do not separate till they have come to perfection. If taken at
first, they are very easily tamed, and soon lose all their natural
ferocity; however, they never shew any remarkable signs of docility, but
continue stupid and rude, without attachment, or even seeming to know the
hand that feeds them. They only continue to do no mischief; and they may be
permitted to run tame, without apprehending any dangerous consequen∣ces. They
seldom stray far from home; they return of themselves to the sty; and
do not quarrel among each other, except when they happen to be fed in common.
At such times, they have an angry kind of growl, much stronger
and-harsher than that of an hog; but they are seldom heard to scream as
the former, only now and then, when frighted, or irritated, they have an abrupt
angry manner of blowing like the boar.</P>
<P>The peccary, though like the hog in so many various respects,
is, nevertheless, a very distinct race, and will not mix, nor produce an
inter∣mediate breed. The European hog has been <PB REF="210"/>

transplanted into America, and suffered to run wild among the woods; it is
often seen to herd among a drove of peccaries, but never to breed from them.
They may, therefore, be considered as two distinct creatures; the hog is
the larger, and the more useful animal; the peccary, more feeble and local;
the hog subsists in most parts of the world, and in almost every
climate; the peccary is a native of the warmer regions, and cannot
subsist in ours, without shelter and assistance. It is more than
probable, however, that we could readily propagate the breed of this
quadrupede, and that, in two or three ge∣nerations, it might be familiarized to
our climate: but as it is inferior to the hog, in every respect, so it
would be needless to admit a new domestic, whose services are better
sup∣plied in the old.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>THE CAPIBARA, OR CABIAI.</HEAD>
<P>THERE are some quadrupedes so entirely different from any that
we are acquainted with, that it is hard to find a well known animal to which to
resemble them. In this case, we must be content to place them near such
as they most approach in form and habits, so that the reader may at once
have some idea of the creature's <PB N="190" REF="214"/> shape or
disposition, although, perhaps, an in∣adequate and a very confused
one.</P>
<P>Upon that confused idea, however, it will be our business to
work; to bring it, by degrees, to greater precision; to mark out the
differences of form, and thus give the clearest notions that words can
easily convey. The known animal is a kind of rude sketch of the figure we
want to exhibit; from which, by degrees, we fashion out the shape of the
creature we desire should be known; as a statuary seldom begins his
work, till the rude outline of the figure is given by some other
hand.—In this manner, I have placed the Capibara among the hog kind,
merely because it is more like an hog than any other animal commonly known,
and yet, more closely examined, it will be found to differ in some of the
most obvious particulars.</P>
<P>The Capibara resembles an hog of about two years old, in the
shape of its body, and the coarseness and colour of its hair. Like the
hog, it has a thick short neck, and a rounded bristly back; like the hog,
it is fond of the water and marshy places, brings forth many at a time, and,
like it, feeds upon animal and ve∣getable food. But, when examined more nearly,
the differences are many and obvious. The head is longer, the eyes are larger,
and the <PB N="191" REF="215"/> snout, instead of being rounded, as in the
hog, is split, like that of a rabbit or hare, and fur∣nished with thick
strong whiskers; the mouth is not so wide, the number and the form of the
teeth are different, for it is without tusks: like the peccary, it wants a
tail; and, unlike to all others of this kind, instead of a cloven hoof, it is
in a manner web-footed, and thus entirely fitted for swimming and living in
the water. The hoofs before are divided into four parts; and those behind,
into three; between the divisions, there is a prolongation of the skin,
so that the foot, when spread in swim∣ming, can beat a greater surface
of water.</P>
<P>As its feet are thus made for the water, so it is seen to
delight entirely in that element; and some naturalists have called it the
Water-hog for that reason. It is a native of South America, and is chiefly
seen frequenting the borders of lakes and rivers, like the otter. It seizes
the fish upon which it preys, with its hoofs and teeth, and carries them to
the edge of the lake, to devour them at its ease. It lives also upon
fruits, corn, and sugar-canes. As its legs are long and broad, it is often
seen sitting up, like a dog that is taught to beg. Its cry more nearly
resembles the braying of an ass, than the grunting of an hog. It seldom
goes our, ex∣cept <PB N="192" REF="216"/> at night, and that always in company.
It never ventures far from the sides of the river or the lake in which it
preys; for as it runs ill, because of the length of its feet, and the
short∣ness of its legs, so its only place of safety is the water, into
which it immediately plunges when pursued, and keeps so long at the bottom,
that the hunter can have no hopes of taking it there. The Capibara, even in a
state of wildness, is of a gentle nature, and, when taken young, is
easily tamed. It comes and goes at command, and even shews an attachment to
its keeper. Its flesh is said to be fat and tender, but, from the nature of
its food, it has a fishy taste, like that of all those which are bred in
the water. Its head, however, is said to be excellent; and, in this, it
resembles the beaver, whose fore parts taste like flesh, and the hinder
like the fish it feeds on.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>THE BABYROUESSA, OR INDIAN HOG.</HEAD>
<P>THE Babyrouessa is still more remote from the hog kind than
the capibara; and yet, most travellers who have described this animal, do
not scruple to call it the Hog of Bouro, which is an island in the
East-Indies, where it is prin∣cipally to be found. Probably the animal's
figure upon the whole most resembles that of <PB REF="217"/>

</FIGURE> <PB N="193" REF="221"/> the hog kind, and may have induced
them to rank it among the number: however, when they come to its description,
they represent it as having neither the hair, the bristles, the head, the
stature, nor the tail of an hog. Its legs, we are told, are longer, its
snout shorter, its body more slender, and somewhat resembling that of
a stag; its hair is finer, of a grey colour, rather resembling wool than
bristles, and its tail also tufted with the same. From these
va∣rieties, therefore, it can scarcely be called an hog; and yet, in this
class we must be content to rank it until its form and nature come to be
better known. What we at present prin∣cipally distinguish it by are four
enormous tusks, that grow out of each jaw; the two largest from the upper,
and the two smallest from the under. The jaw-bones of this extraordinary
animal are found to be very thick and strong; from whence these monstrous
tusks are seen to proceed, that distinguish it from all other
quadrupedes what∣soever. The two that go from the lower jaw are not above a
foot long, but those of the upper are above half a yard: as in the boar, they
bend circularly, and the two lower stand in the jaw as they are seen to do
in that animal; but the two upper rise from the upper jaw, rather like horns
than teeth; and, bending up∣wards <PB N="194" REF="222"/> and backwards,
sometimes have their points directed to the animal's eyes, and are often
fatal by growing into them. Were it not that the Babyrouessa has two such
large teeth underneath, we might easily suppose the two upper to be
horns; and, in fact, their sockets are directed upwards; for which reason
Doctor Grew was of that opinion. But, as the teeth of both jaws are of the
same consistence, and as they both grow out of sockets in the same
manner, the analogy between both is too strong not to suppose them of the
same nature. The upper teeth, when they leave the socket, im∣mediately
pierce the upper lips of the animal, and grow as if they immediately went from
its cheek. The tusks in both jaws are of a very fine ivory, smoother and
whiter than that of the elephant, but not so hard or serviceable.</P>
<P>These enormous tusks give this animal a very formidable
appearance; and yet it is thought to be much less dangerous than the wild
boar<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon, vol. xxv. p. 179.</BIBL></NOTE>.
Like animals of the hog kind, they go together in a body, are often seen in
company with the wild boar, with which, however, they are never known to
engender. They have a very strong scent, which discovers them to the
hounds; and, when pursued, they growl dreadfully, often turn∣ing 
<PB N="195" REF="223"/> back upon the dogs, and wounding them with the tusks
of the lower jaw, for those of the upper are rather an obstruction than a
defence. They run much swifter than the boar, and have a more exquisite
scent, winding the men and the dogs at a great distance. When hunted
closely, they generally plunge themselves into the sea, where they swim
with great swiftness and facility, diving, and rising again at
plea∣sure; and in this manner they most frequently escape their
pursuers. Although fierce and ter∣rible when offended, yet they are peaceable
and harmless when unmolested. They are easily tamed, and their flesh is
good to be eaten; but it is said to putrefy in a very short time. They have
a way of reposing themselves different from most other animals of the
larger kind; which is by hitching one of their upper tusks on the branch of a
tree, and then suffering their whole body to swing down at ease. Thus
sus∣pended from a tooth, they continue the whole night quite secure, and
out of the reach of such animals as hunt them for prey.</P>
<P>The Babyrouessa, though by its teeth and tusks it seems
fitted for a state of hostility, and probably is carnivorous, yet,
nevertheless, seems chiefly to live upon vegetables and the leaves of
trees. It seldom seeks to break into <PB N="196" REF="224"/> gardens, like
the boar, in order to pillage the more succulent productions of human
industry, but lives remote from mankind, content with coarser fare and
security. It has been said that it was only to be found in the island of
Borneo, but this is a mistake, as it is well known in many other parts, both
of Asia and Africa, as at the Celebes, at Estrila, Senegal, and
Ma∣dagascar<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Anderson's Natural History of
Greenland.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P>Such are the animals of the hog kind, which are not distinctly
known; and even all these, as we see, have been but imperfectly examined,
or described. There are some others of which we have still more imperfect
notices; such as the Warree, an hog of the isthmus of Darien, described
by Wafer, with large tusks and small ears, and bristles like a coarse
fur all over the body. This, however, may be the European hog, which has run
wild in that part of the new world, as no other traveller has taken no∣tice of
the same. The Canary boar seems dif∣ferent from other animals of this kind,
by the largeness of its tusks; and, as is judged from the skeleton, by
the apperture of its nostrils, and the number of its grinders. I cannot
con∣clude this account of those animals that are thus furnished with
enormous tusks, without <PB N="197" REF="225"/> observing that there is a
strong consent between these and the parts of generation. When
ca∣strated, it is well known that the tusks grow much smaller, and are
scarce seen to appear without the lips; but what is still more
remark∣able, is, that in a boar, if the tusks by any ac∣cident or design be
broke away, the animal abates of its fierceness and venery, and it pro∣duces
nearly the same effect upon its consti∣tution as if castration had
actually taken place<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Lisle's Husbandry, vol.

<PB N="198" REF="226"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. VII. Animals of the Cat Kind.</HEAD>
<P>WE have hitherto been describing a class of peaceful and
harmless animals, that serve as the instruments of man's happiness, or
at least that do not openly oppose him. We come now to a bloody and
unrelenting tribe, that disdain to own his power, and carry on unceasing
hosti∣lities against him. All the class of the cat kind are chiefly
distinguished by their sharp and for∣midable claws, which they can hide
and extend at pleasure. They lead a solitary ravenous life, neither uniting
for their mutual defence, like vegetable feeders, nor for their mutual
support, like those of the dog kind. The whole of this cruel and ferocious
tribe seek their food alone; and, except at certain seasons, are even
enemies to each other. The dog, the wolf, and the bear, are sometimes known
to live upon vege∣table or farinaceous food; but all of the cat kind, such as
the lion, the tiger, the leopard, and the ounce, devour nothing but flesh,
and starve upon any other provision.</P>
<P>They are, in general, fierce, rapacious, subtle and cruel, unfit
for society among each other, and incapable of adding to human hap∣piness. 
<PB N="199" REF="227"/> However, it is probable that even the fiercest could
be rendered domestic, if man thought the conquest worth the trouble. Lions
have been yoked to the chariots of conquerors, and tigers have been taught to
tend those herds which they are known at present to destroy; but these
services are not sufficient to recom∣pence for the trouble of their
keeping; so that ceasing to be useful, they continue to be nox∣ious, and
become rebellious subjects because not taken under equal protection with
the rest of the brute creation.</P>
<P>Other tribes of animals are classed with dif∣ficulty; have often
but few points of re∣semblance; and, though alike in form, have different
dispositions, and different appetites. But all those of the cat kind,
although differing in size, or in colour, are yet nearly allied to each
other; being equally fierce, ra∣pacious, and artful; and he that has seen one
has seen all. In other creatures there are many changes wrought by human
assiduity; the dog, the hog, or the sheep, are altered in their na∣tures
and forms, just as the necessities or the caprice of mankind have found
fitting; but all of this kind are inflexible in their forms, and wear the print
of their natural wildness strong upon them. The dogs or cows vary in
dif∣ferent <PB N="200" REF="228"/> countries, but lions or tigers are still
found the same; the very colour is nearly alike in all; and the slightest
alterations are sufficient to make a difference in the kinds, and to give the
animal a different denomination.</P>
<P>The cat kind are not less remarkable for the sharpness and
strength of their claws, which thrust forth from their sheath when they
seize their prey, than for the shortness of their snout, the
roundness of their head, and the large whiskers which grow on the upper
lip. Their teeth also, which amount to the number of thirty, are very
formidable; but are rather cal∣culated for tearing their prey than for chewing
it; for this reason they feed but slowly; and while they eat, generally
continue growling, to deter others from taking a share. In the dog kind, the
chief power lies in the under jaw, which is long, and furnished with
muscles of amazing strength; but in these the greatest force lies in
the claws, which are extended with great ease, and their gripe is so
tenacious that nothing can open it. The hinder parts in all these animals are
much weaker than those before; and they seem less made for strength
than agility. Nor are they endued with the swiftness of most other
animals; but generally owe their subsistence rather to catching their
prey by surprize than <PB N="201" REF="229"/> by hunting it fairly down. They
all seize it with a bound, at the same time expressing their fierce
pleasure with a roar; and their first grasp generally disables the
captive from all further resistance. With all these qualifications for
slaughter, they nevertheless seem timid and cowardly, and seldom make
an attack, like those of the dog kind, at a disadvantage: on the contrary,
they fly when the force against them is superior, or even equal to their
own; and the lion himself will not venture to make a second attempt, where
he has been once re∣pulsed with success. For this reason, in countries
that are tolerably inhabited, the lion is so cowardly, that he is often
scared away by the cries of women and children.</P>
<P>The cat, which is the smallest animal of this kind, is the only
one that has been taken under human protection, and may be considered as a
faithless friend, brought to oppose a still more insidious enemy<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This description is nearly translated from Mr. Buffon: what is
added by me, is marked with inverted commas.</NOTE>. It is, in fact, the only
animal of this tribe whose services can more than recompence the trouble of
their edu∣cation, and whose strength is not sufficient to make its anger
formidable. The lion or the tiger may easily be tamed, and rendered
sub∣servient <PB N="202" REF="230"/> to human command; but even in their
humblest, and most familiar moments, they are still dangerous; since
their strength is such, that the smallest fit of anger or caprice may
have dreadful consequences. But the cat, though easily offended, and often
capricious in her re∣sentments, is not endued with powers sufficient to do
any great mischief. Of all animals, when young, there is none more prettily
playful than the kitten; but it seems to lose this disposition as it
grows old, and the innate treachery of its kind is then seen to prevail. From
being na∣turally ravenous, education teaches it to dis∣guise its appetites,
and to watch the favourable moment of plunder; supple, insinuating, and
artful, it has learned the arts of concealing its intentions till it can put
them into execution; when the opportunity offers, it at once seizes upon
whatever it finds, flies off with it, and continues at a distance till it
supposes its offence forgotten. The cat has only the appearance of
attachment; and it may easily be perceived, by its timid approaches, and
side-long looks, that it either dreads its master, or distrusts his
kindness: different from the dog, whose caresses are sincere, the cat
is assiduous rather for its own pleasure, than to please; and often
gains confidence, only to abuse it. The form of its <PB N="203" REF="231"/>
body, and its temperament, correspond with its disposition; active,
cleanly, delicate, and vo∣luptuous, it loves its ease, and seeks the
softest cushions to lie on. 
<Q REND="inline">"Many of its habits, how∣ever, are rather the
consequences of its for∣mation, than the result of any perverseness in
its disposition; it is timid and mistrustful, be∣cause its body is
weak, and its skin tender; a blow hurts it infinitely more than it does a
dog, whose hide is thick and body muscular; the long fur in which the cat
is cloathed, entirely disguises its shape, which, if seen naked, is
long, feeble, and slender; it is not to be wondered, therefore, that it
appears much more fearful of chastisement than the dog, and often flies,
even when no correction is intended. Being also the native of the warmer
climates, as will be shewn hereafter, it chuses the softest bed to lie
on, which is always the warmest."</Q></P>
<P>The cat goes with young fifty-six days, and seldom brings forth
above five or six at a time. The female usually hides the place of her
re∣treat from the male, who is often found to devour her kittens. She feeds
them for some weeks with her milk, and whatever small ani∣mals she can
take by surprize, accustoming them betimes to rapine. Before they are a
year old, they are sit to engender; the female <PB N="204" REF="232"/> seeks
the male with cries; nor is their copu∣lation performed without great pain,
from the narrowness of the passage in the female. They live to about the
age of ten years; and, during that period, they are extremely vivacious,
suf∣fering to be worried a long time before they die.</P>
<P>The young kittens are very playful and amusing; but their sport
soon turns into malice, and they, from the beginning, shew a
disposi∣tion to cruelty; they often look wistfully towards the cage,
sit centinels at the mouth of a mouse-hole, and, in a short time, become
more expert hunters, than if they had received the instructions of art.
Indeed, their disposition is so incapable of constraint, that all
instruction would be but thrown away. It is true, that we are told of the
Greek monks of the isle of Cyprus, teaching cats to hunt the serpents with
which the island is infested; but this may be natural to the animal
itself, and they might have fallen upon such a pursuit without any
instruc∣tion. Whatever animal is much weaker than themselves, is to them an
indiscriminate object of destruction. Birds, young rabbits, hares, rats and
mice, bats, moles, toads and frogs, are all equally pursued; though not,
perhaps, equally acceptable. The mouse seems to be <PB N="205" REF="233"/>
their favourite game; and, although the cat has the sense of smelling in
but a mean degree, it, nevertheless, knows those holes in which its prey
resides. I have seen one of them patiently watch an whole day until the
mouse appeared, and continue quite motionless until it came within reach,
and then seized it with a jump. Of all the marks by which the cat discovers
its natural malignity, that of playing and sporting with its little captive
before killing it outright, is the most flagrant.</P>
<P>The fixed inclination which they discover for this peculiar manner
of pursuit, arises from the conformation of their eyes. The pupil in man,
and in most other animals, is capable but of a small degree of contraction
and dilatation, it enlarges a little in the dark, and contracts when the light
pours in upon it, in too great quantities. In the eyes of cats, however, this
contraction and dilatation of the pupil, is so considerable, that the
pupil, which by day-light appears narrow and small, like the black of ones
nail, by night expands over the whole surface of the eye-ball, and, as every
one must have seen, their eyes seem on fire. By this peculiar
conformation, their eyes see better in darkness than light; and the animal
is thus <PB N="206" REF="234"/> better adapted for spying out and surprizing
its prey.</P>
<P>Although the cat is an inhabitant of our houses, yet it cannot
properly be called a dependant; although perfectly tame, yet it acknowledges no
obedience; on the contrary, it does only just what it thinks fit, and no art
can controul any of its inclinations. In general, it is but half tamed; and has
its attachments rather to the place in which it resides, than to the
inhabitant. If the inhabitant quits the house, the cat still remains; and
if carried elsewhere, seems for a while bewildered with its new
situ∣ation. It must take time to become acquainted with the holes and
retreats in which its prey resides, with all the little labyrinths through
which they often make good an escape.</P>
<P>The cat is particularly fearful of water, of cold, and of ill
smells. It loves to keep in the sun, to get near the fire, and to rub
itself against those who carry perfumes. It is exces∣sively fond of
some plants, such as valerian, marum, and cat-mint: against these it
rubs, smells them at a distance, and, at last, if they be planted in a
garden, wears them out.</P>
<P>This animal eats slowly, and with difficulty, as its teeth are
rather made for tearing, than <PB N="207" REF="235"/> chewing its aliments. For
this reason, it loves the most tender food, particularly fish, which it
eats as well boiled as raw. Its sleeping is very light; and it often seems
to sleep, the better to deceive its prey. When the cat walks, it treads very
softly, and without the least noise; and as to the necessities of
nature, it is cleanly to the last degree. Its fur also is usually sleek
and glossy; and, for this reason, the hair is easily electrified,
sending forth shining sparks, if rubbed in the dark.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">"The wild cat breeds with the tame<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>British Zoology.</BIBL></NOTE>; and, therefore, the latter
may be considered only as a variety of the former: however, they differ in
some particulars; the cat, in its savage state, is somewhat larger than
the house-cat; and its fur being longer, gives it a greater appearance than
it really has; its head is bigger, and face flatter; the teeth and claws much
more formi∣dable; its muscles very strong, as being formed for rapine; the
tail is of a moderate length, but very thick and flat, marked with alternate
bars of black and white, the end always black; the hips and hind part of the
lower joints of the leg, are always black; the fur is very soft and fine: the
general colour of these animals, in England, is a yellowish white, mixed
with a <PB N="208" REF="236"/> deep grey. These colours, though they appear at
first sight confusedly blended together, yet, on a close inspection,
will be found to be disposed like the streaks on the skin of the tiger,
pointing from the back downwards, rising from a black list, that runs from
the head, along the middle of the back, to the tail. This animal is found in
our larger woods; and is the most destructive of the carnivorous kinds in
this kingdom. It inhabits the most mountainous and woody parts of these
islands, living mostly in trees, and feeding only by night. It often
happens, that the females of the tame kind go into the woods to seek mates
among the wild ones. It should seem, that these, however, are not
original inhabitants of this kingdom, but were introduced first in a
domestic state, and afterwards became wild in the woods, by ill usage or
neglect. Certain it is, the cat was an animal much higher in esteem among our
ancestors than it is at present. By the laws of Howel, the price of a
kitten, before it could see, was to be a penny; till it caught a mouse, two
pence; and, when it commenced mouser, four pence: it was required, besides,
that it should be perfect in its senses of hearing and seeing, be a
good mouser, have the claws whole, and be a good nurse. If it failed in any
of <PB N="209" REF="237"/> these qualities, the seller was to forfeit to the
buyer the third part of its value. If any one stole or killed the cat that
guarded the prince's granary, he was to forfeit a milch ewe, its fleece and
lamb, or as much wheat as, when poured on the cat suspended by the tail
(the head touching the floor) would form an heap high enough to cover the tip
of the former. From hence we discover, besides a picture of the
simplicity of the times, a strong argument that cats were not naturally
bred in our forests. An animal that could be so easily taken, could never
have been rated so highly; and the pre∣cautions laid down to improve the
breed, would have been superfluous, in a creature that multiplies to such
an amazing degree. 
<P>"In our climate, we know but of one variety of the wild cat;
and, from the accounts of travellers, we learn, that there are but very few
differences in this quadrupede in all parts of the world. The greatest
difference, indeed, between the wild and the tame cat, is rather to be found
internally than in their outward form. Of all other quadrupedes, the wild cat
is, perhaps, that whose intestines are proportionably the smallest and
the shortest. The intestines of the sheep, for instance, unravelled
out, and measured according to their length, will be <PB N="210" REF="238"/>
found to be above thirty times the length of its body; whereas, the wild cat's
intestines, being measured out, will not be found above three times the
length of its body. This is a surprizing difference; but we may account for
it, from the nature of the food in the two animals; the one living upon
vegetables, which requires a longer, and a more tedious preparation, before
they can become a part of its body; the other, living upon flesh, which
requires very little alteration, in order to be assimilated into the
substance of the creature that feeds upon it. The one, therefore, wanted a
long canal for the properly digesting and straining its food; the other,
but a short one, as the food is already prepared to pass the usual
secretions: however, a difficulty still remains behind; the intestines of
the wild cat are, by one third, shorter than those of the tame. How can we
account for this? If we say that the domestic cat, living upon more
nourishing and more plentiful pro∣vision, has its intestines enlarged to
the quantity with which it is supplied, we shall find this observation
contradicted in the wild boar and the wolf, whose intestines are as long as
those of the hog or the dog, and yet they lead a savage life, and, like the
wild cat, are fed by precarious subsistence. The shortness,
there∣fore, <PB N="211" REF="239"/> of the wild cat's intestines, is still
un∣accounted for; and most naturalists consider the difficulty as
inextricable. We must leave it, therefore, as one of those difficulties
which future observation or accident are most likely to
discover."</P></Q></P>
<P>This animal is one of those few which are common to the new
continent, as well as the old. When Christopher Columbus first
dis∣covered that country, an hunter brought him one, which he had
discovered in the woods, which was of the ordinary size, the tail very long
and thick. They were common also in Peru, although they were not rendered
domestic. They are well known also in several parts of Africa, and many
parts of Asia. In some of these countries they are of a peculiar colour,
and inclining to blue. In Persia, Pietro della Valle informs us, that there
is a kind of cat, particularly in the province of Chorazan, of the figure and
form of the ordinary one, but infinitely more beautiful in the lustre and
colour of its skin. It is of a grey blue, without mix∣ture, and as soft and
shining as silk. The tail is very long, and covered with hair six inches
long, which the animal throws upon its back, like the squirrel. These cats
are well known in France; and have been brought over into <PB N="212" REF="240"/> England, under the name of the <HI>blue cat,</HI> which, however, is
not their colour.</P>
<P>Another variety of this animal is called by us the <HI>lion
cat</HI>; or, as others more properly term it, the Cat of Angora. These are
larger than the common cat, and even than the wild one. Their hair is much
longer, and hangs about their head and neck, giving this creature the
appearance of a lion. Some of these are white, and others of a dun colour.
These come from Syria and Persia, two countries which are noted for giving
a long soft hair to the animals which are bred in them. The sheep, the
goats, the dogs and the rabbits of Syria, are all remarkable for the fine
glossy length and softness of their hair; but par∣ticularly the cat,
whose nature seems to be so inflexible, conforms to the nature of the
climate and soil, loses its savage colour, which it pre∣serves almost
in every other part of the world, and assumes the most beautiful
appearance. There are some other varieties in this animal, but rather in
colour than in form; and, in ge∣neral, it may be remarked, that the cat, when
carried into other countries, alters but very little, still preserving its
natural manners, ha∣bits and conformation.</P>

very small<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This description is principally taken
from Mr. Buffon: such parts as are added from others, I have marked with
commas.</NOTE>; he is found to subsist in all parts of the earth, as well
under the frozen poles, as beneath the torrid zone: but in animals, the climate
may be considered as congenial, and a kind of second nature. They almost
all have their particular latitudes, beyond which they are unable to
subsist; either perishing with a moderate cold, or dying for want of a
frozen air, even in a temperate climate. The rein∣deer is never seen to
depart from the icy fields of the north; and, on the contrary, the lion
degenerates, when taken from beneath the line. The whole earth is the native
country of man; but all inferior animals, have each their own peculiar
districts.</P>
<P>Most terrestrial animals are found larger, fiercer, and
stronger, in the warm than in the cold or temperate climates. They are also
more courageous and enterprizing; all their dispositions seeming to
partake of the ardour of their native soil. The lion, produced under

<PB N="214" REF="245"/> the burning sun of Africa, is, of all others, the
most terrible, the most undaunted. The wolf or the dog, instead of
attempting to rival him, scarce deserve to attend his motions, or become
his providers. Such, however, of these animals, as are bred in a more
temperate climate, or towards the tops of cold and lofty mountains, are far
more gentle, or, to speak more properly, far less dangerous than those
bred in the torrid vallies beneath. The lions of Mount Atlas, the tops of which
are covered in eternal snows, have neither the strength nor the ferocity of
the lions of Bildul∣gerid or Zaara, where the plains are covered with burning
sands. It is particularly in these frightful deserts, that those
enormous and ter∣rible beasts are found, that seem to be the scourge and
the terror of the neighbouring kingdoms. Happily, indeed, the species is not
very nu∣merous; and it seems to be diminishing daily; for those who have
travelled through these countries, assure us, that there are by no means
so many there at present, as were known for∣merly; and Mr. Shaw observes,
that the Romans carried fifty times as many lions from Lybia, in one year, to
combat in their amphitheatres, as are to be found in the whole country at this
time. The same remark is made with regard <PB N="215" REF="246"/> to Turky, to
Persia, and the Indies; where the lions are found to diminish in their
numbers every day. Nor is it difficult to assign the cause of this
diminution: it is obvious that it cannot be owing to the encrease of the
force of other quadrupedes, since they are all inferior to the lion, and,
consequently, instead of les∣sening the number, only tend to encrease
the supplies on which they subsist; it must, there∣fore, be
occasioned by the encrease of mankind, who is the only animal in nature
capable of making head against these tyrants of the forest, and
preventing their encrease. The arms even of an Hottentot or a Negroe make
them more than a match for this powerful creature; and they seldom make the
attack, without coming off victorious. Their usual manner is to find out his
retreat, and, with spears headed with iron, to provoke him to the combat:
four men are considered as sufficient for this encounter; and he against
whom the lion flies, receives him upon his spear, while the others attack him
behind; the lion, finding himself wounded in the rear, turns that way, and
thus gives the man he first attacked, an opportunity to recover. In this
manner they attack him on all sides; until, at last, they entirely
disable, and then dispatch him. This superiority in the numbers, 
<PB N="216" REF="247"/> and the arts of man, that are sufficient to con∣quer
the lion, serve also to enervate and dis∣courage him; for he is brave
only in proportion to the success of his former encounters. In the vast
deserts of Zaara, in the burning sands that lie between Mauritania and
Negroland, in the uninhabited countries that lie to the north of Cafraria, and,
in general, in all the deserts of Africa, where man has not fixed his
habita∣tion, the lions are found in great numbers, and preserve their natural
courage and force. Ac∣customed to measure their strength with every
animal they meet, the habit of conquering ren∣ders them intrepid and terrible.
Having never experienced the dangerous arts and combina∣tions of man, they have
no apprehensions from his power. They boldly face him, and seem to brave
the force of his arms. Wounds rather serve to provoke their rage than
repress their ardour. They are not daunted even with the opposition of
numbers; a single lion of the de∣sert often attacks an entire caravan; and,
after an obstinate combat, when he finds himself overpowered, instead of
flying, he continues to combat, retreating, and still facing the enemy till
he dies. On the contrary, the lions which inhabit the peopled countries of
Morocco or India, having become acquainted with human <PB N="217" REF="248"/>
power, and experienced man's superiority, have lost all their courage, so
as to be scared away with a shout; and seldom attack any but the
unresisting flocks or herds, which even women and children are sufficient
to protect.</P>
<P>This alteration in the lion's disposition suf∣ficiently
shews that he might easily be tamed, and admit of a certain degree of
educa∣tion. 
<Q REND="inline">"In fact, nothing is more common than for the
keepers of wild beasts to play with this animal, to pull out his tongue, and
even to chastise him without a cause. He seems to bear it all with the
utmost composure; and we very rarely have instances of his reveng∣ing
these unprovoked sallies of impertinent cruelty. However, when his anger is
at last excited, the consequences are terrible. Labat tells us of a
gentleman who kept a lion in his chamber, and employed a servant to at∣tend
it; who, as is usual, mix'd his blows with caresses. This ill-judged
association con∣tinued for some time; till one morning the gentleman was
awakened by a noise in his room, which, at first, he could not tell the
cause of; but, drawing the curtains, he per∣ceived an horrid spectacle; the
lion growling over the man's head, which he had sepa∣rated from the body, and
tossing it round the <PB N="218" REF="249"/> floor. He immediately,
therefore, flew into the next room, called to the people with∣out, and had the
animal secured from doing further mischief."</Q> However, this single
ac∣count is not sufficient to weigh against the many instances we every
day see of this creature's gentleness and submission. He is often
bred up with other domestic animals, and is seen to play innocently and
familiarly among them; and, if it ever happens that his natural ferocity
returns, it is seldom exerted against his bene∣factors. As his passions
are strong, and his appetites vehement, one ought not to presume that the
impressions of education will always prevail; so that it would be
dangerous in such circumstances to suffer him to remain too long without
food, or to persist in irritating and abusing him: however, numberless,
accounts assure us that his anger is noble, his courage magnanimous, and
his disposition grateful. He has been often seen to despise
contemptible enemies, and pardon their insults when it was in his power to
punish them. He has been seen to spare the lives of such as were thrown
to be devoured by him, to live peaceably with them, to afford them a part of
his subsistence, and sometimes to want food himself rather than
de∣prive them of that life which his generosity had spared.</P>
<P><PB N="219" REF="250"/>It may also be said that the lion is not
cruel, since he is so only from necessity, and never kills more than he
consumes. When satiated, he is perfectly gentle; while the tiger, the wolf,
and all the inferior kinds, such as the fox, the pole-cat, and the ferret,
kill without remorse, are fierce without cause, and, by their
indis∣criminate slaughter, seem rather to satisfy their malignity than
their hunger.</P>
<P>The outward form of the lion seems to speak his internal
generosity. His figure is striking, his look confident and bold, his gait
proud, and his voice terrible. His sta∣ture is not overgrown, like that of
the ele∣phant, or rhinoceros; nor is his shape clumsy, like that of the
hippopotamos, or the ox. It is compact, well proportioned, and sizeable; a
perfect model of strength joined with agility. It is muscular and bold,
neither charged with fat or unnecessary flesh. It is sufficient but to
see him in order to be assured of his superior force. His large head
surrounded with a dread∣ful mane; all those muscles that appear under the
skin swelling with the slightest exertions; and the great breadth of
his paws, with the thickness of his limbs, plainly evince that no other
animal in the forest is capable of oppos∣ing him. He has a very broad face
that, as some have imagined, resembles the human. It <PB N="220" REF="251"/>
is surrounded with very long hair, which gives it a very majestic air. The
top of the head, the temples, the cheeks, the under jaw, the neck, the
breast, the shoulder, the hinder part of the legs, and the belly, are
furnished with it, while all the rest of the body is covered with very
short hair, of a tawny colour. 
<Q REND="inline">"The length of the hair in many parts, and the
short∣ness of it in others, serves a good deal to dis∣guise this
animal's real figure. The breast, for instance, appears very broad, but in
reality it is as narrow and contracted in proportion as that of the generality
of dogs and horses. For the same reason, the tail seems to be of an
equal thickness from one end to the other, on account of the inequality of
the hair with which it is encom∣passed; it being shorter near the
insertion where the flesh and bones are large, and growing longer in
proportion as its real thickness lessens towards the point, where it ends
in a tuft. The hair about the neck and breast is not dif∣ferent from that on
the rest of the body, except in the length of it; nor is each hair pointed as
in most other animals, but of an equal thick∣ness from one end to the
other. The neck is very strong, but not composed of one solid bone, as
Aristotle has imagined; on the con∣trary, though very short and muscular,
it has <PB N="221" REF="252"/> as many bones as the camel or the horse; for it
is universal to all quadrupedes to have seven joints in the neck; and not
one of them have either more or less. However, the muscles in the neck of
the lion, that tye the bones toge∣ther, are extremely strong, and have
some∣what the appearance of bones; so that ancient authors, who have
treated of this animal, have mistaken the whole for a single bone. The
tongue is rough, and beset with prickles as hard as a cat's claws; these
have the grain turned backwards; so that it is probable a lion, if it
should attempt to lick a man's hand, as we are told it sometimes does,
would tear off the skin. The eyes are always bright and fiery; nor even in
death does this terrible look forsake them. In short, the structure of
the paws, teeth, eyes, and tongue, are the same as in a cat; and also in
the inward parts these two ani∣mals so nearly resemble each other, that
the anatomist's chief distinction arises merely from the size."</Q></P>
<P>The lion has, as was observed before, a large mane, which grows
every year longer as the animal grows older: the lioness is without this
ornament at every age. This mane is not coarse or rough as in an horse, but
composed of the same hair with the rest of the body, lengthened, 
<PB N="222" REF="253"/> and shining. The mane, as well as the rest of the
body, is of a yellow colour; nor is there ever any difference to be found in
the colour of one lion from that of another. What the ancients might have
said concerning black lions, or white, or streaked like the tiger, is not
confirmed by modern experience; so that these varieties have never been
seen, or exist no longer.</P>
<P>It is usually supposed that the lion is not
pos∣sessed of the sense of smelling in such perfec∣tion as
most other animals. It is also observed, that too strong a light
greatly incommodes him. This is more than probable from the formation of his
eyes, which, like those of the cat, seem fitted for seeing best in the
dark. For this rea∣son, he seldom appears in open day, but ra∣vages chiefly
by night; and not only the lion, but all other animals of the cat kind, are
kept off by the fires which the inhabitants light to preserve their herds and
flocks; the brightness of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lame dazzles their eyes, which are only fitted for seeing in the
dark; and they are afraid to venture blindly into those places which they
know to be filled with their enemies. 
<Q REND="inline">"It is equally true of all this kind, that they
hunt rather by the sight than the smell; and it sometimes happens that
the lion pursues either <PB N="223" REF="254"/> the jackall or the wild dog,
while they are hunting upon the scent; and, when they have run the beast
down, he comes in and monopo∣lizes the spoil. From hence, probably, may have
arisen the story of the lion's provider: these little industrious
animals may often, it is true, provide a feast for the lion; but they have
hunted merely for themselves, and he is an unwelcome intruder upon the fruits
of their toil."</Q></P>
<P>The lion, when hungry, boldly attacks all animals that come in his
way; but, as he is very formidable, and as they all seek to avoid him, he is
often obliged to hide, in order to take them by surprize. For this purpose
he crouches on his belly, in some thicket, or among the long grass, which
is found in many parts of the forest; in this retreat he continues, with
patient expectation, until his prey comes within a proper distance, and he
then springs after it, fifteen or twenty feet from him, and often seizes it
at the first bound. If he misses the effort, and in two or three
reiterated springs cannot seize his prey, he continues motionless for a
time, seems to be very sensible of his disappointment, and waits for a
more success∣ful opportunity. In the deserts and forests, his most
usual prey are the gazelles and the <PB N="224" REF="255"/> monkeys, with
which the torrid regions abound. The latter he takes when they happen to be
upon the ground, for he cannot climb trees like the cat or the tiger. He
devours a great deal at a time, and generally fills himself for two or three
days to come. His teeth are so strong that he very easily breaks the
bones, and swallows them with the rest of the body. It is reported that he
sustains hunger a very long time, but thirst he cannot support in an
equal degree, his temperament being extremely hot; some have even
asserted that he is in a continual fever. He drinks as often as he meets
with water, lapping it like a cat; which, as we know, drinks but slowly. He
generally re∣quires about fifteen pound of raw flesh in a day; he prefers
that of live animals, and par∣ticularly those which he has just killed. He
seldom devours the bodies of animals when they begin to putrify; and he
chuses rather to hunt for a fresh spoil than to return to that which he
had half devoured before. However, though he usually feeds upon fresh
provision, his breath is very offensive, and his urine
insup∣portable.</P>
<P>The roaring of the lion is so loud, that when it is heard in the
night, and re-echoed by the mountains, it resembles distant thunder. This 
<PB N="225" REF="256"/> roar is his natural note; for when enraged he has a
different growl, which is short, broken, and reiterated. The roar is a deep
hollow growl, which he sends forth five or six times a day, particularly
before rains. The cry of anger is much louder and more formidable. This is
always excited by opposition; and upon those occasions, when the lion
summons up all his terrors for the combat, nothing can be more terrible. He
then lashes his sides with his long tail, which alone is strong enough to
lay a man level. He moves his mane in every direc∣tion; it seems to rise
and stand like bristles round his head; the skin and muscles of his
face are all in agitation; his huge eye-brows half cover his glaring eye balls;
he discovers his teeth, which are formed rather for destruction than
chewing his food; he shews his tongue covered with points, and extends his
claws, which ap∣pear almost as long as a man's fingers. Pre∣pared in this
manner for war, there are few ani∣mals that will venture to engage him; and
even the boldest of the human kind are daunted at his approach. The elephant,
the rhinoceros, the tiger, and the hippopotamos, are the only animals that are
not afraid singly to make op∣position.</P>
<P><PB N="226" REF="257"/> 
<Q REND="inline">"Nevertheless, neither the leopard nor the wild
boar, if provoked, will shun the combat; they do not seek the lion to
attack, but will not fly at his approach; they wait his onset, which he
seldom makes unless compelled by hunger; they then exert all their
strength, and are sometimes successful. We are told of the combat of a
lion and a wild boar, in a meadow near Algiers, which continued for a long time
with incredible obstinacy. At last, both were seen to fall by the wounds
they had given each other; and the ground all about them was co∣vered with
their blood. These instances how∣ever are very rare, for the lion is in
general the undisputed master of the forest. Man is the only creature
that attacks him with almost cer∣tain success; with the assistance
of dogs and horses, which are trained to the pursuit. These animals that,
in a state of nature, would have fled from the presence of the lion, in an
agony of consternation, when conscious of the assistance of man,
become pursuers in turn, and boldly hunt their natural tyrant. The dogs are
al∣ways of the large breed; and the horses them∣selves, as Gasner
assures us, must be of that sort called Charossi, or lion eyed, all
others of this kind flying at the sight of the lion, and 
<PB N="227" REF="258"/> endeavouring to throw their riders. When the lion is
rouzed, he recedes with a slow proud motion; he never goes off directly
forward, nor measures his paces equally, but takes an oblique course, going
from one side to the other, and bounding rather than running. When the
hunters approach him, they either shoot or throw their javelins; and in this
man∣ner disable him before he is attacked by the dogs, many of whom he would
otherwise de∣stroy. He is very vivacious, and is never killed at once, but
continues to fight despe∣rately even after he has received his mortal blow.
He is also taken by pit-falls; the na∣tives digging a deep hole in the
ground, and covering it slightly over with sticks and earth; which,
however, give way beneath his weight, and he sinks to the bottom, from whence
he has no means of escape. But the most usual manner of taking this
animal is while yet a cub, and incapable of resistance. The place near the
den of the lioness is generally well known by the greatness of her
depredations on that occasion; the natives, therefore, watch the time of her
absence and, aided by a swift horse, carry off her cubs; which they
sell to strangers, or to the great men of their country."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="228" REF="259"/>The lion, while young and active, lives by
hunting in the forest at the greatest distance from any human habitation;
and seldom quits this retreat while able to subsist by his natural
industry; but when he becomes old, and unfit for the purposes of
surprize, he boldly comes down into places more frequented, attacks the
flocks and herds that take shelter near the ha∣bitation of the shepherd or
the husbandman, and depends rather upon his courage than his address for
support. It is remarkable, however, that when he makes one of these
desperate sallies, if he finds men and quadrupedes in the same field, he
only attacks the latter, and never meddles with men, unless they provoke him
to engage. It is observed that he prefers the flesh of camels to any other
food; he is like∣wise said to be fond of that of young elephants; these
he often attacks before their trunk is yet grown; and, unless the old
elephant comes to their assistance, he makes them an easy prey.</P>
<P>The lion is terrible upon all occasions, but particularly at
those seasons when he is incited by desire, or when the female has
brought forth. It is then that the lioness is seen followed by eight or ten
males, who sight most bloody battles among each other, till one of them
be∣comes <PB N="229" REF="260"/> victorious over all the rest. She is said
to bring forth in spring, and to produce but once a year. 
<Q REND="inline">"With respect to the time of gestation,
naturalists have been divided, some asserting that the lioness went
with young six months, and others but two. The time also of their growth
and their age have hitherto been left in obscurity; some asserting that
they acquired their full growth in three years, and others that they required a
longer period to come to perfection; some saying (and among this number is
Mr. Buffon) that they lived to but twenty, or twenty-two years at most;
others making their lives even of shorter duration. All these doubts are
now reduced to certainty; for we have had several of these animals bred in
the Tower; so that the manner of their co∣pulation, the time of their
gestation, the num∣ber they bring forth, and the time they take to come to
perfection, are all pretty well known. Although the lion emits his urine
backwards, yet he couples in the ordinary man∣ner; and, as was said before,
his internal struc∣ture in almost every respect resembles that of a
cat. The lioness, however, is upon these oc∣casions particularly fierce,
and often wounds the lion in a terrible manner. She goes with young, 
<PB N="230" REF="261"/> as I am assured by her keeper, no more than five
months; the young ones, which are never more than two in number when brought
forth, are about the size of a large pug dog, harmless, pretty, and
playful; they continue the teat for twelve months, and the animal is more than
five years in coming to perfection. As to its age, from its imprisoned
state, we can have no cer∣tainty; since it is very probable that, being
deprived of its natural climate, food, and ex∣ercise, its life must be very
much abridged. However, naturalists have hitherto been greatly mistaken as
to the length of its existence. The great he-lion, called Pompey, which died
in the year 1760, was known to have been in the Tower for above seventy
years; and one lately died there, which was brought from the river Gambia, that
died above sixty-three. The lion, therefore, is a very long-lived animal;
and, very probably, in his native forests, his age exceeds even that of man
himself."</Q></P>
<P>In this animal, all the passions, even of the most gentle
kind, are in excess, but particu∣larly the attachment of the female to her
young. The lioness, though naturally less strong, less courageous, and
less mischievous than the lion, becomes terrible when she has got young
ones <PB N="231" REF="262"/> to provide for. She then makes her incursions
with even more intrepidity than the lion him∣self; she throws herself
indiscriminately among men and other animals; destroys without
di∣stinction; loads herself with the spoil, and brings it home reaking to
her cubs; whom she accustoms betimes to cruelty and slaughter. She
usually brings forth in the most retired and inaccessible places; and
when she fears to have her retreat discovered, often hides her tracks, by
running back her ground, or by brushing them out with her tail. She
sometimes also, when her apprehensions are great, transports them from
one place to another; and, if ob∣structed, defends them with determined
cou∣rage, and fights to the last.</P>
<P>The lion is chiefly an inhabitant of the torrid zone; and, as was
said, is always most for∣midable there: nevertheless, he can
subsist in more temperate climates; and there was a time when even the
southern parts of Europe were infested by him. At present, he is only
found in Africa and the East-Indies; in some of which countries he grows to
an enormous height. The lion of Bildulgedid is said to be nearly five feet
high, and between nine and ten feet from the tip of the nose to the
insertion of the tail. <PB N="232" REF="263"/> We have in the Tower, at
present, one of above four feet high, that was brought from Morocco, which is
the largest that for some time past has been seen in Europe. The
or∣dinary size is between three and four feet; the female being in all her
dimensions about one third less than the male. There are no lions in
America; the Puma, which has received the name of the America Lion, is, when
compared, a very contemptible animal, having neither the shape, the size,
nor the mane of the lion; being known to be extremely cowardly, to climb trees
for its prey, to subsist rather by its cunning than its courage, and to
be inferior even to the animal that goes by the name of the American Tiger. We
ought not, therefore, to confound this little treacherous creature with the
lion, which all the ancients have concurred in deno∣minating the king of
beasts, and which they have described as brave and merciful. 
<Q REND="inline">"In∣deed, the numerous accounts which they have
given us of this animal's generosity and tender∣ness, shew that there
must be some foundation for the general belief of its good qualities; for
mankind seldom err when they are all found to unite in the same story.

than this animal; the glossy smoothness of his hair, which lies much
smoother, and shines with greater bright∣ness than even that of the
leopard; the extreme blackness of the streaks with which he is marked, and
the bright yellow colour of the ground which they diversify, at once strike
the beholder. To this beauty of colouring is added an extremely elegant form,
much larger indeed than that of the leopard, but more slender, more delicate,
and bespeaking the most ex∣treme swiftness and agility. Unhappily,
how∣ever, this animal's disposition is as mischievous as its form is
admirable, as if Providence was willing to shew the small value of beauty,
by bestowing it on the most noxious of quadru∣pedes. <PB N="234" REF="268"/>
We have, at present, one of these ani∣mals in the Tower, which to the view
appears the most good natured and harmless creature in the world; its
physiognomy is far from fierce or angry; it has not the commanding stern
countenance of the lion, but a gentle placid air; yet for all this it is fierce
and savage beyond measure; neither correction can terrify it, nor
indulgence can tame."</Q></P>
<P>The chief and most observable distinction in the tiger, and
in which it differs from all others of the mottled kind, is in the shape of
its co∣lours, which run in streaks or bands in the same direction as his
ribs from the back down to the belly. The leopard, the panther, and the ounce,
are all partly covered like this animal, but with this difference, that their
colours are broken in spots all over the body; whereas in the tiger they
stretch lengthwise, and there is scarce a round spot to be found on his
skin. Besides this there are other observable distinc∣tions: the tiger
is much larger, and often found bigger even than the lion himself: it is much
slenderer also in proportion to its size; its legs shorter, and its
neck and body longer. In short, of all other animals, it most resembles
the cat in shape; and, if we conceive the latter <PB N="235" REF="269"/>
magnified to a very great degree, we shall have a tolerable idea of the
former.</P>
<P>In classing carnivorous animals, we may place the lion
foremost<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The remainder of this description is taken

him follows the tiger, which seems to par∣take of all the noxious qualities
of the lion without sharing any of his good ones. To pride, courage, and
strength, the lion joins greatness, clemency, and generosity; but the
tiger is fierce without provocation, and cruel without necessity. The lion
seldom ravages except when excited by hunger; the tiger, on the con∣trary,
though glutted with slaughter, is not sa∣tisfied, still continues the
carnage, and seems to have its courage only enflamed by not find∣ing
resistance. In falling in among a flock or an herd, it gives no quarter,
but levels all with indiscriminate cruelty, and scarce finds time to
appease its appetite while intent upon satisfying the malignity of its
nature. It thus becomes the scourge of the country where it is found; it
fears neither the threats nor the opposition of mankind; the beasts both
wild and tame fall equally a sacrifice to its insatiable fury; the young
elephant and the rhinoceros become <PB N="236" REF="270"/> equally its prey, and
it not unfrequently ven∣tures to attack the lion himself.</P>
<P>Happily for the rest of nature, that this ani∣mal is not common,
and that the species is chiefly confined to the warmest provinces of the
east. The tiger is found in Malabar, in Siam, in Ben∣gal, and in all the
same countries which are inha∣bited by the elephant or the rhinoceros. Some
even pretend that it has a friendship for, and often accompanies the latter,
in order to devour its excrements, which serve it as a purge. Be this as it
will, there is no doubt but that they are often seen together at the sides
of lakes and rivers; where they are probably both compelled to go by the
thirst which in that torrid climate they must very often endure. It is
likely enough also that they seldom make war upon each other, the
rhinoceros being a peaceable animal, and the tiger knowing its strength too
well to venture the engagement. It is still more likely that the tiger finds
this a very convenient situ∣ation, since it can there surprize a greater
num∣ber of animals, which are compelled thither from the same motives. In
fact, it is generally known to lurk near such places where it has an
opportunity of chusing its prey, or rather of multiplying its massacres.
When it has <PB N="237" REF="271"/> killed one it often goes to destroy
others, swal∣lowing their blood at large draughts, and seem∣ing rather
glutted than satiated with its abun∣dance.</P>
<P>However, when it has killed a large ani∣mal, such as an horse,
or a buffalo, it imme∣diately begins to devour it on the spot, fearing to be
disturbed. In order to feast at its ease, it carries off its prey to the
forest, dragging it along with such ease, that the swiftness of its
motion seems scarce retarded by the enormous load it sustains. From
this alone we may judge of its strength; but, to have a more just idea of
this particular, let us stop a moment to con∣sider the dimensions of this
most formidable creature. Some travellers have compared it for size to an
horse, and others to a buffalo, while others have contented themselves with
saying that it was much larger than a lion. We have recent accounts of this
animal's magnitude that deserve the utmost confidence. Mr. Buffon has been
assured by one of his friends that he saw a tiger, in the East-Indies,
of fifteen feet long. 
<Q REND="inline">"Supposing that he means including the tail,
this animal, allowing four feet for that, must have been eleven feet from the
tip of the nose to the insertion of the tail. Indeed, that which is now in
the Tower is not so large, being as <PB N="238" REF="272"/> well as I could
measure six feet from the tip to the insertion, and the tail was three
feet more. Like all the rest of its kind, its motions are irregular and
defaltory; it bounds rather than runs; and like them rather chuses to take
its prey by surprize than to be at the trouble of hunting it down."</Q> How
large a leap it can take at once we may easily judge, by comparing what it
might do to what we see so small an animal as the cat actually perform.
The cat can leap several feet at a bound; and the tiger, who is ten times as
long, can no doubt spring proportionably.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">"The tiger is the only animal whose spirit
seems untameable. Neither force nor con∣straint, neither violence nor
flattery, can pre∣vail in the least on its stubborn nature. The
caresses of the keeper have no influence on their heart of iron; and time,
instead of mollifying its disposition, only serves to encrease its
fierce∣ness and malignity. The tiger snaps at the hand that feeds it as
well as that by which it is chastised; every object seems considered
only as its proper prey, which it devours with a look; and, although confined
by bars and chains, still makes fruitless efforts, as if to shew its
malig∣nity when incapable of exerting its force."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="239" REF="273"/>To give a still more complete idea of the
strength of this terrible creature, we shall quote a passage from
Father Tachard, who was an eye-witness of a combat between a tiger and two
elephants at Siam. For this purpose, the king ordered a lofty palisade to
be built of bambou cane, about an hundred feet square; and in the midst of
this were three elephants appointed for combating the tiger. Their heads and a
part of their trunk was covered with a kind of armour, like a mask, which
defended that part from the assaults of the fierce animal with which they
were to engage. As soon, says this author, as we were arrived at the place,
a tiger was brought forth from its den, of a size much larger than we had
ever seen before. It was not at first let loose, but held with chords,
so that one of the elephants approaching, gave it three or four terrible
blows, with its trunk, on the back, with such force, that the tiger was for
some time stunned, and lay without motion, as if it had been dead. However,
as soon as it was let loose, and at full liberty, although the first
blows had greatly abated its fury, it made at the elephant with a loud
shriek, and aimed at seizing his trunk. But the elephant, wrinkling it up
with great dexterity, received the tiger on his great teeth, and tossed it
up into the air. <PB N="240" REF="274"/> This so discouraged the furious
animal, that it no more ventured to approach the elephant, but made several
circuits round the pallisade, often attempting to fly at the spectators.
Shortly after, three elephants were sent against it, and they continued to
strike it so terribly with their trunks, that it once more lay for dead;
and they would certainly have killed it, had not there been a stop put to the
combat.</P>
<P>From this account, we may readily judge of the strength of this
animal, which, though re∣duced to captivity, and held by chords, though first
disabled, and set alone against three, yet ventured to continue the
engagement, and even that against animals covered and protected from its
fury.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">"Captain Hamilton informs us, that in the Sundah
Rajha's dominions there are three forts of tigers in the woods, and that the
smallest are the fiercest. This is not above two feet high, appears to be
extremely cunning, and delights in human flesh. The second kind is about
three feet high, and hunts deer and wild hogs, besides the little animal
which has been already described, under the name of the Chevrotain, or Guinea
deer. The tiger of the largest sort, is above three feet and an half high;
but, al∣though endued with greater powers, is, by no <PB N="241" REF="275"/>
means, so rapacious as either of the former. This formidable animal, which is
called the Royal Tiger (one of which we have at present in the Tower) does
not seem so ravenous nor so dangerous, and is even more cowardly. A
peasant in that country, as this traveller in∣forms us, had a buffalo fallen
into a quagmire, and, while he went for assistance, there came a large
tiger, that, with its single strength, drew forth the animal, which the
united force of many men could not effect. When the people re∣turned to the
place, the first object they beheld was the tiger, who had thrown the buffalo
over its shoulder, as a fox does a goose, and was car∣rying it away, with
the feet upward, towards its den; however, as soon as it saw the men, it
let fall its prey, and instantly fled to the woods: but it had previously
killed the buffalo, and sucked its blood; and, no doubt, the people were very
well satisfied with its retreat. It may be observed, that some
East-Indian buf∣faloes weigh above a thousand pounds, which is twice as
heavy as the ordinary run of our black cattle; so that from hence we may form
a conception of the enormous strength of this rapacious animal, that could
thus run off with a weight at least twice as great as that of itself. 
<P><PB N="242" REF="276"/>"Were this animal as common as the
panther, or even as the lion himself, thus fur∣nished as it is with the
power to destroy, and the appetite for slaughter, the country would be
uninhabitable where it resides. But luckily the species is extremely
scarce; and has been so since the earliest accounts we have had of the
tiger. About the times of Augustus, we are assured by Pliny<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Plin. Hist. Nat. lib. viii. c. 17.</BIBL></NOTE>, that
when panthers were brought to Rome by hundreds, a single tiger was
considered as an extraordinary sight; and he tells us, that the emperor
Claudius was able to procure four only; which shews how difficultly they were
procured. The incredible fierceness of this animal may be, in some
mea∣sure, the cause of the scarcity which was then at Rome, since it
was the opinion of Varo, that the tiger was never taken alive<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"> 
<Q REND="inline">Tigris vivus capi ad huc non potuit. 
<BIBL>Var de ling. Lat.</BIBL></Q></NOTE>: but its being a
native only of the East-Indies, and that par∣ticularly of the warmer regions,
it is not to be wondered that the species should be so few."</P></Q></P>
<P>We may, therefore, consider the species of true streaked
tiger, as one of the scarcest of animals, and much less diffused than
that of the lion. As to the number of its young, we have <PB N="243" REF="277"/>
no certain accounts; however, it is said, that it brings forth four or five
at a time. Although furious at all times, the female, upon this oc∣casion,
exceeds her usual rapacity; and, if her young are taken from her, she
pursues the spoiler with incredible rage; he, to save a part, is
contented to lose a part, and drops one of her cubs, with which she
immediately returns to her den, and again pursues him; he then drops another,
and by the time she has returned with that, he generally escapes with the
remainder. If she loses her young entirely, she then be∣comes
desperate, boldly approaches even the towns themselves, and commits
incredible slaughter. The tiger expresses its resentment in the same
manner with the lion; it moves the muscles and skin of its face, shews
its teeth, and shrieks in the most frightful manner. Its note is very
different from that of the lion; being rather a scream than a roar: and the
an∣cients expressed it very well, when they said that, 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>tigrides indomitae rancant rugiunt que
leones.</HI></Q></P>
<P>The skin of these animals is much esteemed all over the
east, particularly in China; the Mandarines cover their seats of justice
in the public places with it, and convert it into co∣verings for cushions in
winter. In Europe, these skins, though but seldom to be met with, 
<PB N="244" REF="278"/> are of no great value, those of the panther and the
leopard being held in much greater esti∣mation. This is all the little
benefit we derive from this dreadful animal, of which so many falsehoods
have been reported; as, that its sweat was poisonous, and the hair of its
whiskers more dangerous than an envenomed arrow. But the real mischiefs
which the tiger occasions while living are sufficient, without giving
ima∣ginary ones to the parts of its body when dead. In fact, the Indians
sometimes eat its flesh, and find it neither disagreeable nor
unwholsome.</P>
<P>There is an animal of America, which is usually called the Red
Tiger, but Mr. Buffon calls it the Cougar, which, no doubt, is very different
from the tiger of the east. Some, however, have thought proper to rank both
together; and I will take leave to follow their example, merely because the
cougar is more like a tiger in every thing, except the colour, than any other
animal I know, having the head, the body and the neck, shaped very much in
the same manner. Of these slight differences, words would give but a very
faint idea; it will be, therefore, sufficient to observe, that they are
both equally slender, and are smaller where the neck joins the head, than
others of the panther kind. There is one at <PB N="245" REF="279"/> present in
the Tower; and it seemed to me, as well as I could see it through the bars,
that were it properly streaked and coloured, it would in all things
resemble a small tiger. It is, however, of a very different colour, being
of a deep brown, and the tail very long and pointed. It is rather darker on the
back; un∣der the chin it is a little whitish, as also on the lower part of
the belly.</P>
<P>Of all the American animals, this is the most formidable and
mischievous; even their pre∣tended lion not excepted. It is said, there are
several sorts of them; and, as well as I can re∣member, I have seen one
or two here in En∣gland, both differing from the present, in size and
conformation. It is, indeed, a vain endea∣vour to attempt to describe all the
less obvious varieties in the cat kind. If we examine them minutely, we
shall find the differences multiply upon us so much, that, instead of an
history, we shall only be paid with a catalogue of distinctions. From
such of them as I have seen, within these last six years, I think I
could add two animals of this species, that have not been hitherto
described, and with the names of which he that shewed them was utterly
unac∣quainted. But it is a poor ambition, that of being eager to find out new
distinctions, or <PB N="246" REF="280"/> adding one noxious animal more, to a
list that is already sufficiently numerous. Were the knowing a new variety
to open an unknown history, or in the least to extend our knowledge, the
enquiry would be then worth pursuing; but what signifies mentioning some
trifling differ∣ence, and from thence becoming authors of a new name, when the
difference might have ori∣ginally proceeded either from climate, soil, or
indiscriminate copulation?</P>
<P>The cougars are extremely common in South America, and, where the
towns border upon the forest, these make frequent incursions by night
into the midst of the streets, carrying off fowls, dogs, and other
domestic creatures. They are, however, but weak and contemptible, com∣pared
to the great tiger, being found unable to cope with a single man. The Negroes
and Indians are very dextrous in encountering them; and some, even for the
sake of their skins, seek them in their retreats. The arms in this
combat, seemingly so dangerous, are only a launce of two or three yards
long, made of heavy wood, with the point hardened in the fire; and a kind of
scymitar, of about three quarters of a yard in length. Thus armed, they wait
till the tiger makes an assault against the left hand, which holds the
lance, and is <PB N="247" REF="281"/> wrapped up in a short cloak of baize.
Some∣times the animal, aware of the danger, seems to decline the combat; but
then its antagonist provokes it with a slight touch of the launce, in
order, while he is defending himself, to strike a sure blow. As soon,
therefore, as the creature feels the lance, it grasps it with one of its
paws, and with the other strikes at the arm which holds it. Then it is that
the person nimbly aims a blow with his scymetar, which he kept concealed,
with the other hand, and hamstrings the creature, which immediately draws
back enraged, but instantly returns to the charge. But then, receiving
another stroke, it is totally deprived of the power of motion: and the
combatant, killing it at his leisure, strips the skin, cuts off the head,
and returns to his companions, displaying these as the trophies of his
victory.</P>
<P>This animal, as we are assured, is often more successful
against the crocodile; and it is the only quadrupede in that part of the
world, that is not afraid of the engagement. It must be no unpleasant
sight to observe, from a place of safety, this extraordinary combat,
between ani∣mals so terrible and obnoxious to man. Such as have seen it,
describe it in the following manner. When the tiger, impelled by thirst, 
<PB N="248" REF="282"/> that seems continually to consume it, comes down to
the river side to drink, the crocodile, which makes no distinction in its
prey, lifts its head above water to seize it; the tiger, not less rapacious
than the other, and unacquainted with the force of the enemy, boldly ventures
to seize it, and plunges its claws into the eyes of the crocodile, which is
the only vulnerable part of its body: upon this the crocodile instantly dives
under water, and the tiger goes down with him, for it will sooner die than
let go its hold. In this manner the combat continues for some time, until the
tiger is drowned, or escapes, as is sometimes the case, from its
disabled enemy.</P>
<P>These animals are common in Guiana<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon vol. xix. p. 22.</BIBL></NOTE>. They were formerly
seen swimming over, in great numbers, into the island of Cayenne, to
attack and ravage the flocks and herds of the inhabitants. In the beginning,
they were a terrible scourge to the infant colony; but, by degrees, they were
repulsed and destroyed, and are now seen no longer at that place. They
are found in Brazil, in Paraguay, in the country of the Amazons, and in
several other parts of South America. They often climb trees in quest of
prey, or to avoid their pursuers. They <PB REF="283"/>

other animals of the cat kind; or, more properly speaking, they seldom
venture near those places where they see it kindled, as they are always
sure of their enemies being near, and their nocturnal eyes are dazzled by the
brightness of the blaze. From the description of this animal, one would be
hardly led to suppose, that its flesh was good for food; and yet we have
several accounts which alledge the fact, some asserting it to be
superior even to mutton; however, what Mon∣sieur Des Marchais observes,
is most likely to be true; namely, that the most valuable part of this
animal is its skin, and that its flesh is but indifferent eating, being
generally lean, and usually having a strong fumet.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>THE PANTHER, AND THE LEOPARD.</HEAD>
<P>WE have hitherto found no great difficulty in distinguishing
one animal from another, each carrying its own peculiar marks, which, in some
measure, serve to separate it from all the rest. But it is otherwise,
when we come to these of the cat kind, that fill up the chasm between the
tiger and the cat. The spots with which their skins are diversified, are
so various, and their size so equivocal, that it is no easy matter to 
<PB N="250" REF="288"/> distinguish the species, particularly as we have
little else but the spots and the size to guide us in making the
distinction. If we regard the figure and diversity of the spots, we
shall find many varieties not taken notice of by any natu∣ralist; if we are
led by the size, we shall find an imperceptible gradation from the cat to
the tiger. It would be vain, therefore, to make as many varieties in these
animals as we see differ∣ences in spots or stature; it will be
sufficient to seize the most general distinctions, and leave the rest
to such as are fond of more minute disquisitions.</P>
<P>Of all this tribe, whose skins are so beauti∣fully
spotted, and whose natures are so mis∣chievous, the Panther may be
considered as the foremost. This animal has been by many naturalists
mistaken for the tiger; and, in fact, it approaches next to it in size,
fierceness and beauty. It is distinguished, however, by one obvious and
leading character; that of being spotted, not streaked; for, in this
particular, the tiger differs from the panther, the leopard, and almost all
the inferior ranks of this mis∣chievous family.</P>
<P>This animal, which Mr. Buffon calls simply the Panther, Linnaeus
the Pard, Gesner the Pardalis, and the modern Latins the Leopardus; 
<PB N="251" REF="289"/> this animal, I say, which goes by too many names, and
which the English have indiscrimi∣nately called by the name of the panther
or the leopard, may be considered as the largest of the kind, and is
spotted in a manner somewhat different from those that are smaller. As
those spots, however, make the principal difference between it and the
lesser animals, which it otherwise resembles in shape, size,
disposition, and beauty, I will first shew those slight
di∣stinctions, and mention the names each animal has received in
consequence thereof; and then proceed to give their history together,
still marking any peculiarity observable in one of the species, which is
not found in the rest.</P>
<P>Next to the great panther, already mentioned, is the animal which
Mr. Buffon calls the Leopard, a name which he acknowledges to be given
arbitrarily, for the sake of distinction. Other naturalists have not much
attended to the slight differences between this and the great panther, nor
have they considered its discrimi∣nations as sufficient to entitle it to
another name. It has hitherto, therefore, gone under the name of the Leopard,
or Panther of Senegal, where it is chiefly found. The differences between this
animal and the former are these: the large panther is often found to be six
feet long, from <PB N="252" REF="290"/> the tip of the nose to the insertion
of the tail; the panther of Senegal is not above four. The large panther is
marked with spots in the manner of a rose, that is, five or six make a
kind of circle, and there is generally a large one in the middle. The leopard
of Senegal has a much more beautiful coat, the yellow is more brilliant, and
the spots are smaller, and not disposed in rings but in clusters. As
to the rest, they are both whiteish under the belly; the tail in both is
pretty long, but rather longer in proportion in the latter, than the former. To
these two animals, whose differences seem to be so very minute, we may
add a third; namely, the <HI>Jaguar</HI> or Panther of America. This, in every
respect, resembles the two former, except in the disposition of its
spots, and that its neck and head are rather streaked than spotted. The
jaguar is also said to be lower upon its legs, and less than the leopard
of Senegal. These three quadrupedes, as we see, have but very slight
differences, and the principal distinction used by Mr. Buffon, is taken
from the size; the first, as he says, is usually six feet long; the
second, four feet; and the last, about three: however, it appears from the
particular subjects of his description, that the panther in his
possession was not above three feet seven inches long; that 
<PB REF="291"/>

<GAP DESC="duplicate" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/> <PB N="253" REF="294"/> the
leopard's skin which he describes, was about four; and that the jaguar, at
two years old, was between two and three feet long, which, when come to its
full growth, would, no doubt, be four feet long, as well as the two former.
From hence, therefore, we may conclude, that the size in these animals is
not sufficient to make a distinction among them; and that those who
called them all three by the indiscriminate names of the leopard and the
panther, if not right, were at least excuseable. Of those which are now
to be seen in the Tower, the jaguar, or the American panther, is rather the
largest of the three; and is by no means the contemptible animal which Mr.
Buffon describes it to be: the leopard is the least of them, and has, by
some travellers, been supposed to be an animal produced between the
panther and the ounce, an animal which resembles, but is less than any of
the former. These three animals we may, therefore, rank together, as they
agree pretty nearly in their robe, their size, their dispositions, and
their ferocity.</P>
<P>We come next to an animal confessedly dif∣ferent from any of
the former, being much smaller, and its colour more inclining to white. Its
name, however, in our language, has caused no small confusion It has been
ge∣nerally <PB N="254" REF="295"/> called by foreigners, the Onza, or the Ounce,
and this name some of our own writers have thought proper to give it; but
others of them, and these the most celebrated, such as Willoughby, have
given this name to a different animal, with a short tail, and known to the
ancients and moderns by the name of the Lynx. I confess myself at a loss,
in this case, whom to follow; the alteration of names should be al∣ways
made with great caution, and never but in cases of necessity. If we
follow Willoughby, there will be an animal of the panther kind, very
distinguishable from all the rest, left without a name; and if we recede
from him, it will serve to produce some confusion among all the nu∣merous
class of readers and writers who have taken him for their guide: however, as
he seems himself to have been an innovator, the name of the lynx having
been long adopted into our language before, it was unnecessary to give the
animal that bore it another name, and to call that creature an ounce, which our
old writers had been accustomed to know by the Latin appellation, for this
reason, therefore, we may safely venture to take a name that has been long
misapplied, from the lynx, and re∣store it to the animal in question. We
will, therefore, call that animal of the panther kind, <PB REF="296"/>

less than the panther, and with a longer tail, the ounce; and the lynx may
remain in possession of that name by which it was known among all our
old English writers, as well as by all antiquity.</P>
<P>The Ounce, or the Onca of Linnaeus, is much less than the
panther, being not, at most, above three feet and a half long: however, its
hair is much longer than that of the panther, and its tail still more so.
The panther of four or five feet long, has a tail but of two feet, or two feet
and an half. The ounce, which is but about three feet, has a tail often longer
than the rest of its body. The colour of the ounce is also apparently
different, being rather more inclining to a cream colour, which is deeper on
the back, and whiter towards the belly. The hair on the back is an inch and an
half long; that on the belly, two inches and an half, which is much longer than
that of the panther. Its spots are disposed pretty much in the same
manner as the large panther, except that on the haunches it is rather marked
with stripes than with spots.</P>
<P>Descending to animals of this kind that are still smaller,
we find the Catamountain, which is the Ocelot of Mr. Buffon, or the Tiger Cat
of most of those who exhibit it as a show. It is <PB N="256" REF="300"/>
less than the ounce, but its robe more beau∣tifully variegated. It is an
American animal, and is about two feet and an half in length, from the nose
to the insertion of the tail. It is extremely like a cat, except that it is
larger and slenderer, that its colours are more beau∣tiful, and its tail
rather shorter. The fur is of a reddish colour, the whole beautified with
black spots, and streaks of different figures. They are long on the back,
and round on the belly and paws. On the ears are black stripes, which run
across; but, in other respects, they entirely resemble those of a cat.
These colours, however, which naturalists have taken great pains minutely
to describe, are by no means permanent, being differently disposed in
differ∣ent animals of the same species. I remember to have seen an animal
of this size, but whether of this species I will not pretend to say,
some years ago, that was entirely brown, and was said also to have come
from America.</P>
<P>From this tribe of the cat kind with spotted skins and a long
tail, we come to another, with skins diversified in like manner, but with a
shorter tail. The principal of these is the Lynx, the name by which the
animal was known to Aelian, among the ancients; and to all our old English
writers, among those of a <PB N="257" REF="301"/> more modern date. This name
has been corrupted by the Portuguese into the word Ouze; and this corruption
has been adopted by Ray, who has improperly called this animal the Ounce, after
some of the fo∣reign travellers. The first striking distinction between
the lynx, and all those of the panther kind, is in its tail, which is at
least half as short in proportion, and black at the ex∣tremity. Its fur is
much longer, the spots on the skin less vivid, and but confusedly
mingled with the rest. Its ears are much longer, and tipped at the points
with a black tuft of hair. The colour round the eyes is white, and the
physiognomy more placid and gentle. Each hair of this animal is of three
different colours: the root is of a greyish brown; the middle red, or of an
ash colour; and the ends white. This whiteness at the ends takes up so
small a part of the particular hair, that it does not prevent us from
seeing the principal colour, which is that of the middle part; so that it
only makes the surface of the body appear as if it was silvered over:
however, the hair of which the spots consist, has no white at the ends,
and at the roots it is not quite so black as the other part. This animal is
not above the size of the ounce, but is rather stronger built, and it has 
<PB N="258" REF="302"/> but twenty-eight teeth; whereas all the rest of the
cat kind already mentioned have thirty.</P>
<P>Another animal of this kind is called the Sia∣gush, or, as Mr.
Buffon names it, the Caracal. It is a native of the East-Indies, and
resembles the lynx in size, in form, and even in the sin∣gularity of
being tufted at the tips of the ears. However, the siagush differs in not
being mottled as the lynx is; its fur, or rather hair, is rougher and
shorter; its tail is rather longer; its muzzle more lengthened; its
physiognomy more fierce, and its nature more savage.</P>
<P>The third, and last animal that need be men∣tioned of this kind,
is that which Mr. Buffon calls the Serval, and which he has first
described. It is a native of Malabar, resembling the pan∣ther in its
spots, but the lynx in the shortness of its tail, in its size, and in
its strong built form.</P>
<P>These seem to be all the principal distinc∣tions among
animals of the panther kind, from the largest of this tribe down to the
domestic cat, which is the smallest of all these fierce and
mischievous varieties. In all, their nature seems pretty much the same;
being equally fierce, subtle, cruel, and cowardly. The pan∣ther, including
the leopard and the jaguar, or American panther, as they are the largest,
so <PB REF="303"/>

are they the most dangerous of this kind; for the whole race of cats are
noxious in pro∣portion to their power to do mischief. They inhabit the most
torrid latitudes of India, Africa, and America, and have never been able to
mul∣tiply beyond the torrid zone. They are gene∣rally found in the thickest
and the most en∣tangled forests, and often near remote habita∣tions, where
they watch to surprize all kinds of domestic animals. They very seldom
attack man, even though provoked by him; they seem rather desirous of
finding safety by flight, or by climbing trees, at which they are very
expert. In this manner also, they often pursue their prey; and, being
expert at seizing it, as well above as below, they cause a vast
de∣struction. Of all other animals, these are the most sullen, and,
even to a proverb, untame∣able. They still preserve their fierce and
treach∣erous spirit; and at those places where they are exposed to be
seen among others, we often observe, that while their keeper is familiar
with the lion or the bear, yet he is apprehensive of the large panther, and
keeps it bound with the shortest chain.</P>
<P>As the ounce differs from these in figure and size, so
also it seems to differ in disposition, being more mild, tractable, and
tame. These <PB N="260" REF="307"/> we frequently see as harmless and
innocent as cats; and there is one at present in the Tower with which the
keeper plays without the smallest apprehension. I own I was not a little
uneasy, at first, for the man, when he put his hand through the bars, and
called the animal by its name; but was a good deal surprized to see the
creature, which one might suppose irritated by long confinement, come
gently up to him, stroak his hand with its face, in the manner of a cat, and
testify the utmost gentleness of disposition. The ounce, therefore,
is remarkable for being easily tamed; and, in fact, it is employed all over
the east for the purposes of hunting. Not, in∣deed, but that panthers
themselves are some∣times used for this purpose, but they are never
thoroughly subdued like the former, being usually brought to the field in a
carriage, and kept chained and caged until they are shewn the gazelle, or the
leveret, which is their prey. This they pursue rather by three or four great
springs than by running. If they seize it by this sudden effort, it finds
no mercy; but if it escapes from their first effort, they never at∣tempt to
pursue, and appear quite disappointed and confounded at their mischance.
It some∣times happens that they are so much enraged at it, that they attack
even their employer, and <PB N="261" REF="308"/> his only resource to avoid
their fury is to throw them some small pieces of meat, which he has brought
with him for that purpose.</P>
<P>The ounce, however, is not so dangerous; and is treated with
more confidence and fami∣liarity. It is usually brought to the field
hood∣winked behind one of the horsemen. When the game appears, the ounce is
instantly un∣covered, and shewn where it lies; upon which the fierce
creature darts like an arrow to the place, and seizes it at once, or,
missing it, re∣mains motionless in the place. It would be vain to attempt
retrieving its disgrace by con∣tinuing the pursuit; for, although it bounds
with greater agility than most other animals, yet it is slow and aukward in
running, and has no means of finding the animal it pursues by the smell, as
is common among those of the dog kind. From hence, therefore, it appears how
much superior the European method of hunting is to that of the Asiatic;
since what∣ever amusement this exercise affords must arise from the
continuance of the chace, and from the fluctuation of doubt and expectation,
which raise and depress the pursuers by turns. All this an Asiatic
hunter is deprived of; and his greatest pleasure can scarcely be more
than what among us is called coursing, in which the <PB N="262" REF="309"/>
dog pursues the animal, and keeps it constantly in view.</P>
<P>But it must not be supposed that it is from choice the
Asiatics use this method of chace; for, no doubt, were dogs serviceable
among them as they are in Europe, they would be employed for the same
purposes. But the fact is, that the extreme heat of the tropical climates
produces such universal putrefaction, and sends up such various and
powerful scents, that dogs are at first bewildered in the chace, and at
last come to lose the delicacy of their scent entirely. They are,
therefore, but little used in those warm countries; and what could they
avail in places where almost every other animal of the forest is stronger
and more rapacious? The lion, the tiger, the panther, and the ounce, are all
na∣tural enemies to the dog, and attack him where∣ever he appears with
ungovernable fury. The breed, therefore, in those places, would quickly be
destroyed; so that they are obliged to have recourse to those animals
which are more fitted to serve them; and thus convert the ounce to those
purposes for which dogs are employed in Europe.</P>
<P>The Catamountain, or Ocelot, is one of the fiercest and, for its
size, one of the most de∣structive animals in the world. It is, as was 
<PB N="263" REF="310"/> before observed, a native of South-America, and by no
means capable of the same education as the ounce, which it more approaches in
size than in disposition. Two of these, from whom Mr. Buffon has taken
his description, were brought over from Carthagena, and having been taken
from the dam when very young, were afterwards suckled by a bitch. But, before
they were three months old, they had strength and ingratitude sufficient to
kill and devour their nurse. Their succeeding fierceness and malignity
seemed to correspond with their first efforts; for no arts could tame or
soften their natures; and while they continued in their cages, they still
testified an unceasing dispo∣sition for slaughter. When their food
was given them, the male always served himself before the female ventured
to touch a bit; and it was not till he was satisfied that the other began. In
their savage state, these animals are still more destructive; having
great strength and agility, they very easily find and overtake their prey,
which they pursue among the tops of the trees as well as on the ground; but
what renders them still more mischievous is, their unceasing ap∣petite
rather for the blood than the flesh of their prey. They suck this with the
greatest avidity, but frequently leave the carcase otherwise un∣touched, 
<PB N="264" REF="311"/> in order to pursue other animals for the blood in like
manner. They generally continue on the tops of trees, like our wild cats; where
they make their nest, and often bring forth their young. When they spy any
animal they can master, and there are but few in the forest but what are
inferior, they dart down upon it with inevitable exactness.</P>
<P>The whole tribe of animals of the panther kind, with long tails,
are chiefly inhabitants, as was said, of the torrid zone; but those of the
short tailed kind, and particularly the lynx, is principally found in the
cold countries that are bordering on the pole. The lynx is chiefly to be met
with in the north of Germany, Li∣thuania, Muscovy, Siberia, and North
Ame∣rica. Those of the new continent, however, are rather smaller than in
Europe, as is the case with almost all their quadrupedes; they are
somewhat whiter also, but in other respects there is scarce any
difference to be found among them<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon.</BIBL></NOTE>. This animal has been called by some
<HI>Lupus Cervarius,</HI> or a creature compounded be∣tween a wolf and a
stag; but for what reason is hard to guess; it no way resembles either
in shape or in disposition. In its nature, it exactly resembles the
cat, except that, being bigger and <PB N="265" REF="312"/> nearly two feet long,
it is bolder and fiercer. Like the cat, it climbs trees, and seeks its prey
by surprize; like the cat, it is delicate and cleanly, covering its urine
with its paws; and it resembles the wolf in nothing except its cry, which
often deceives the hunters, and induces them to think they hear a wolf and not
a lynx. This animal also, is rather more delicate than the cat; and, after
having once feasted upon its prey, will never return to it again, but hunts
the woods for another. From hence may have arisen the common report of the
lynx having, of all other quadrupedes, the shortest memory. This, however,
is not the only idle story that has been propagated of it: as of its seeing
with such per∣spicuity as to perceive objects through walls and mountains;
as of having its urine of such a quality, as to harden, and become a precious
stone; with several others, propagated by igno∣rance or imposture.</P>
<P>The Siagush and the Serval are both so like all the rest of
the cat kind in disposition, that it is but repeating the same account
once more to give their distinct history. As the lynx is found only in cold
countries, so the siagush is to be met with only in the warm tropical
climates. It is used, in the same manner as the ounce, for hunting; but it
seems to have a property which <PB N="266" REF="313"/> the other has not;
namely, that of being able to overtake its prey by pursuing it. Whether this
is performed by having a finer scent than the former, or greater
swiftness, we are not in∣formed; being only told that when it overtakes
either the gazelle or the antelope, it leaps upon their backs, and, getting
forward to their shoulders, scratches their eyes out, by which means they
become an easy prey to the hunters. Some have called this animal the lion's
pro∣vider; and it is said that when it calls him to pursue his prey, its
voice very much resembles that of one man calling another<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Thevenot, vol. ii. p. 114.</BIBL></NOTE>. From hence we may
conjecture that this animal pursues its prey in full cry, and that the lion
only follows to partake or seize the spoil. The same ac∣count is given
also of the jackal; and very pro∣bably it may be true, not only of these
animals, but of some others, since it is natural enough to suppose that
the lion will pursue whenever he is taught to discover his prey.</P>
<P>We had one of these animals a few years ago sent over from the
East-Indies, but it was not able to endure the change of climate, and it died
in a very short time after it was brought to the Tower. Whether consumed by
disease or not I cannot tell, but it seemed to me much 
<PB N="267" REF="314"/> slenderer than the cat or the lynx, and its ears were
much longer; however, it is a very strong creature for its size, and has
been known to kill a large dog in single combat<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon.</BIBL></NOTE>: never∣theless, it is, like all of
the cat kind except the lion, remarkable for its cowardice, and will never,
except in cases of necessity, attack an animal that is its equal in
strength or activity. For this reason, when brought into the field, and put
upon a service of danger, it obstinately refuses, and is alert only in
the pursuit of animals that are too feeble for resistance, or too timid
to exert their strength.</P>
<P>From what has been said of this rapacious tribe, we perceive a
similitude in the manners and dispositions of them all, from the lion to
the cat. The similitude of their internal con∣formation, is still more
exact; the shortness of their intestines, the number of their teeth, and
the structure of their paws. The first of this class is the Lion,
distinguishable from all the rest by his strength, his magnitude, and
his mane. The second is the Tiger, rather longer than the lion, but not so
tall, and known by the streaks and the vivid beauty of its robe; including
also the American tiger or cougar; distin∣guishable by its size, next
that of the tiger, <PB N="268" REF="315"/> its tawny colour, and its spots.
The third is the Pan∣ther and the Leopard. The four this the Ounce, not so
large as any of the former, spotted like them, but distinguishable by the
cream coloured ground of its hair, and the great length of its tail, being
above the length of its body. The fifth is the Catamountain or Tiger cat,
less than the ounce, but differing particularly in having a shorter tail,
and being streaked down the back like a tiger. The sixth is the short
tailed kind; namely, the Lynx, of the size of the former, but with a short
tail, streaked, and the tips of its ears tufted with black. The seventh is
the Syagush, differing from the lynx in not being mottled like it, in not
being so large, and in having the ears longer, though tipped with black, as
before. The eighth is the Serval, resembling the lynx in its form, and the
shortness of its tail; streaked also like it, but not having the tips
of its ears tufted. Lastly, the Cat, wild and tame, with all its varieties;
all less than any of the former, but, like them, equally insidious,
rapacious, and cruel.</P>
<P>This whole race may be considered as the most formidable enemy
of mankind; there are others indeed stronger, but they are gentle, and never
offer injury till injured: there are others <PB N="269" REF="316"/> more
numerous, but they are more feeble, and rather look for safety by hiding from
man, than opposing him. These are the only qua∣drupedes that make good
their ground against him; and which may be said to keep some kingdoms of
the earth in their own possession. How many extensive countries are
there in Africa, where the wild beasts are so numerous, that man is
deterred from living amongst them; reluctantly giving up to the lion and the
leo∣pard, extensive tracts, that seem formed only for his delight and
convenience!</P>

<PB N="270" REF="317"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. VIII. Animals of the Dog Kind.</HEAD>
<P>THE second class of carnivorous quadru∣pedes may be denominated
those of the dog kind. This class is neither so numerous nor so
powerful as the former, and yet neither so treacherous, rapacious, or
cowardly. This class may be principally distinguished by their claws,
which have no sheath, like those of the cat kind, but still continue at
the point of each toe, without a capability of being stretched forward, or
drawn back. The nose also, as well as the jaw, of all the dog kind, is
longer than in the cat; the body is, in proportion, more strongly made, and
covered with hair instead of fur. There are many internal distinctions
also; as in the intestines, which are much longer in the dog kind, than in
those of the cat; the eye is not formed for night vision; and the olfactory
nerves are diffused, in the dog kinds, upon a very exrensive membrane
within the scull.</P>
<P>If we compare the natural habitudes of this class with the former,
we shall find that the dog kinds are not so solitary as those of the
cat, but love to hunt in company, and encourage each other with their mutual
cries. In this manner <PB N="271" REF="318"/> the dog and the jackall pursue
their prey; and the wolf and fox, which are of this kind, though more
solitary and silent among us, yet, in coun∣tries where less persecuted,
and where they can more fearless display their natural inclinations, they
are found to keep together in packs, and pursue their game with alternate
howlings.</P>
<P>Animals of the dog kind want some of the advantages of the cat
kind, and yet are possessed of others in which the latter are
deficient. Upon observing their claws, it will easily be per∣ceived that
they cannot, like cats, pursue their prey up the sides of a tree, and
continue the chace among the branches; their unmanage∣able claws cannot stick
in the bark, and thus support the body up along the trunk, as we see the
cat very easily perform: whenever, there∣fore, their prey flies up the tree
from them, they can only follow it with their eyes, or watch its motions till
hunger again brings it to the ground. For this reason, the proper prey of the
dog kind, are only those animals that, like themselves, are unfitted for
climbing; the hare, the rabbit, the gazelle, or the roebuck.</P>
<P>As they are, in this respect, inferior to the cat, so they
exceed it in the sense of smelling; by which alone they pursue their
prey with certainty of success, wind it through all its 
<PB N="272" REF="319"/> mazes, and tire it down by perseverance. It often
happens, however, in the savage state, that their prey is either too much
diminished, or too wary to serve for a sufficient supply. In this
case, when driven to an extremity, all the dog kinds can live for some time
upon fruits and vegetables, which, if they do not please the appetite, at
least serve to appease their hunger.</P>
<P>Of all this tribe, the Dog has every reason to claim the
preference, being the most intelligent of all known quadrupedes, and the
acknow∣ledged friend of mankind. The dog<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The rest of
this description of the dog is taken from Mr. Buffon: what I have added, is
marked as before.</NOTE>, inde∣pendant of the beauty of his form, his vivacity,
force and swiftness, is possessed of all those in∣ternal
qualifications that can conciliate the affections of man, and make the tyrant a
protector. A natural share of courage, an angry and ferocious
disposition, renders the dog, in its savage state, a formidable enemy
to all other animals: but these readily give way to very different qualities
in the domestic dog, whose only ambition seems the desire to please;
he is seen to come crouching along, to lay his force, his courage, and all
his useful talents, at the feet of his master; he waits his orders, to 
<PB N="273" REF="320"/> which he pays implicit obedience; he consults his
looks, and a single glance is sufficient to put him in motion; he is more
faithful even than the most boasted among men; he is constant in his
affections, friendly without interest, and grateful for the slightest
favours; much more mindful of benefits received, than injuries of∣fered; he is
not driven off by unkindness; he still continues humble, submissive,
and implor∣ing; his only hope to be serviceable, his only terror to
displease; he licks the hand that has been just lifted to strike him,
and at last dis∣arms resentment, by submissive perseverance.</P>
<P>More docile than man, more obedient than any other animal, he is not
only instructed in a short time, but he also conforms to the
dis∣positions and the manners of those who com∣mand him. He takes his
tone from the house he inhabits; like the rest of the domestics, he is
disdainful among the great, and churlish among clowns. Always assiduous
in serving his master, and only a friend to his friends, he is indifferent
to all the rest, and declares himself openly against such as seem to
be dependant like himself. He knows a beggar by his cloaths, by his voice, or
his gestures, and forbids his approach. When at night the guard of the 
<PB N="274" REF="321"/> house is committed to his care, he seems proud of
the charge; he continues a watchful centinel, he goes his rounds, scents
strangers at a distance, and gives them warning of his being upon duty. If
they attempt to break in upon his territories, he becomes more fierce, flies at
them, threatens, fights, and either conquers alone, or alarms those who have
most interest in coming to his assistance; however, when he has
conquered, he quietly reposes upon the spoil, and abstains from what he
has deterred others from abusing; giving thus at once a lesson of
courage, temperance, and fidelity.</P>
<P>From hence we see of what importance this animal is to us in a
state of nature. Supposing, for a moment, that the species had not
existed, how could man, without the assistance of the dog, have been
able to conquer, tame, and re∣duce to servitude, every other animal? How
could he discover, chace, and destroy, those that were noxious to him? In
order to be se∣cure, and to become master of all animated nature, it was
necessary for him to begin by making a friend of a part of them; to attach
such of them to himself, by kindness and ca∣resses, as seemed
fittest for obedience and active pursuit. Thus the first art employed by
man, was in conciliating the favour of the dog; and <PB N="275" REF="322"/> the
fruits of this art were, the conquest and peaceable possession of the
earth.</P>
<P>The generality of animals have greater agi∣lity, greater
swiftness, and more formidable arms, from nature, than man; their
senses, and particularly that of smelling, are far more per∣fect: they
having gained, therefore, a new assistant, particularly one whose
scent is so ex∣quisite as that of the dog, was the gaining a new
sense, a new faculty, which before was wanting. The machines and
instruments which we have imagined for perfecting the rest of the
senses, do not approach to that already prepared by nature, by which we are
enabled to find out every animal, though unseen, and thus destroy the
noxious, and use the serviceable.</P>
<P>The dog, thus useful in himself, taken into a participation of
empire, exerts a degree of superiority over all animals that require human
protection. The flock and the herd obey his voice more readily even than that
of the shep∣herd or the herdsman; he conducts them, guards them, keeps them
from capriciously seeking danger, and their enemies he considers as his
own. Nor is he less useful in the pursuit; when the sound of the horn,
or the voice of the huntsman calls him to the field, he testifies his
pleasure by every little art, and pursues with <PB N="276" REF="323"/>
perseverance, those animals, which, when taken, he must not expect to
divide. The desire of hunting is indeed natural to him as well as to his
master, since war and the chace are the only employment of savages. All
animals that live upon flesh hunt by nature; the lion and the tiger, whose
force is so great that they are sure to conquer, hunt alone and without
art; the wolf, the fox, and the wild dog, hunt in packs, assist each
other, and partake the spoil. But when education has perfected this talent in
the domestic dog, when he has been taught by man to repress his ardour, to
measure his motions, and not to exhaust his force by too sudden an
exertion of it, he then hunts with method, and always with success.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">"Although the wild dog, such as he was be∣fore he
came under the protection of mankind, is at present utterly unknown, no
such animal being now to be found in any part of the world, yet there are
many that, from a domestic state, have turned savage, and entirely
pursue the dictates of nature."</Q> In those deserted and uncultivated
countries where the dog is found wild, they seem entirely to partake of the
dis∣position of the wolf; they unite in large bodies, and attack the most
formidable animals of the forest, the cougar, the panther, and the bison. 
<PB N="277" REF="324"/> In America, where they were originally brought by the
Europeans, and abandoned by their masters, they have multiplied to such a
degree, that they spread in packs over the whole country, attack all other
animals, and even man himself does not pass without insult. They are
there treated in the same manner as all other carnivorous animals, and killed
wher∣ever they happen to come: however, they are easily tamed: when taken
home, and treated with kindness and lenity, they quickly become
submissive and familiar, and continue faithfully attached to their
masters. Different in this from the wolf or the fox, who, though taken never
so young, are gentle only while cubs, and, as they grow older, give
themselves up to their natural appetites of rapine and cruelty. In short,
it may be asserted, that the dog is the only animal whose fidelity is
unshaken; the only one who knows his master, and the friends of the family;
the only one who instantly distin∣guishes a stranger; the only one who
knows his name, and answers to the domestic call; the only one who seems
to understand the nature of subordination, and seeks assistance;
the only one who, when he misses his master, testifies his loss by
his complaints; the only one who, carried to a distant place, can find the
way <PB N="276" REF="325"/> <GAP DESC="duplicate" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/> 
<PB N="277" REF="326"/> <GAP DESC="duplicate" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/> 
<PB N="278" REF="327"/> home; the only one whose natural talents are evident,
and whose education is always suc∣cessful.</P>
<P>In the same manner, as the dog is of the most complying
disposition, so also is it the most susceptible of change in its
form; the va∣rieties of this animal being too many for even the most careful
describer to mention. The climate, the food, and the education, all make
strong impressions upon the animal, and pro∣duce alterations in its
shape, its colour, its hair, its size, and in every thing but its nature.
The same dog, taken from one climate, and brought to another, seems to
become another animal; but different breeds are as much se∣parated, to all
appearance, as any two animals the most distinct in nature. Nothing appears
to continue constant with them, but their in∣ternal conformation; different
in the figure of the body, in the length of the nose, in the shape of the
head, in the length and the di∣rection of the ears and tail, in the colour, the
quality, and the quantity of the hair; in short, different in every thing but
that make of the parts which serve to continue the species, and keep the
animal distinct from all others. It is this peculiar conformation, this power
of pro∣ducing an animal that can reproduce, that <PB N="279" REF="328"/> marks
the kind, and approximates forms that at first sight seem never made for
conjunction.</P>
<P>From this single consideration, therefore, we may at once
pronounce all dogs to be of one kind; but which of them is the original of all
the rest, which of them is the savage dog from whence such a variety of
descendants have come down, is no easy matter to determine. We may easily
indeed, observe, that all those ani∣mals which are under the influence of
man, are subject to great variations. Such as have been sufficiently
independant, so as to chuse their own climate, their own nourishment, and
to pursue their own habitudes, preserve the ori∣ginal marks of nature,
without much devi∣ation; and it is probable, that the first of these is
even at this day very well represented in their descendants. But such as
man has sub∣dued, transported from one climate to another, controlled in
their manner of living, and their food, have most probably been changed
also in their forms: particularly the dog has felt these alterations more
strongly than any other of the domestic kinds; for living more like man, he
may be thus said to live more irregularly also, and, consequently, must
have felt all those changes that such variety would naturally pro∣duce.
Some other causes also may be assigned <PB N="280" REF="329"/> for this
variety in the species of the dog: as he is perpetually under the eye of his
master, when accident has produced any singularity in its productions, man
uses all his art to continue this peculiarity unchanged; either by breeding
from such as had those singularities, or by de∣stroying such as
happened to want them; be∣sides, as the dog produces much more fre∣quently
than some other animals, and lives a shorter time, so the chance for its
varieties will be offered in greater proportion.</P>
<P>But which is the original animal, and which the artificial or
accidental variety, is a question which, as was said, is not easily
resolved. If the internal structure of dogs of different sorts be
compared with each other, it will be found, except in point of size, that in
this respect they are exactly the same. This, therefore, affords no
criterion. If other animals be compared with the dog internally, the wolf and
the fox will be found to have the most perfect re∣semblance; it is
probable, therefore, that the dog which most nearly resembles the wolf or
the fox externally, is the original animal of its kind: for it is natural to
suppose, that as the dog most nearly resembles them internally, so he
may be near them in external resemblance also except where art or accident
has altered <PB N="281" REF="330"/> his form. This being supposed, if we
look among the number of varieties to be found in the dog, we shall not find
one so like the wolf or the fox, as that which is called the Shepherd's Dog.
This is that dog with long coarse hair on all parts except the nose,
pricked ears, and a long nose, which is common enough among us, and receives
his name from being prin∣cipally used in guarding and attending on sheep.
This seems to be the primitive animal of his kind; and we shall be the more
con∣firmed in this opinion, if we attend to the different characters which
climate produces in this animal, and the different races of dogs which are
propagated in every country: and, in the first place, if we examine those
countries which are still savage, or but half civilized, where it is most
probable the dog, like his master, has received but few impressions from
art, we shall find the shepherd's dog, or one very like him, still
prevailing amongst them. The dogs that have run wild in America, and in
Congo, approach this form. The dog of Siberia, Lapland, and Iceland, of the
Cape of Good Hope, of Madagascar, Madura, Calicut, and Malabar, have all a
long nose, pricked ears, and resemble the shepherd's dog very nearly. In
Guinea, the dog very speedily takes <PB N="282" REF="331"/> this form; for, at
the second or third gene∣ration, the animal forgets to bark, his ears and his
tail become pointed, and his hair drops off, while a coarser, thinner kind
comes in the place. This sort of dog is also to be found in the tem∣perate
climates in great abundance, particularly among those who, prefering
usefulness to beauty, employ an animal that requires very little
instruction to be serviceable. Notwith∣standing this creature's
deformity, his melan∣choly and savage air, he is superior to all the rest
of his kind in instinct; and, without any teaching, naturally takes to
tending flocks, with an assiduity and vigilance that at once
astonishes, and yet relieves his master.</P>
<P>In more polished and civilized places, the dog seems to partake
of the universal refine∣ment; and, like the men, becomes more beau∣tiful,
more majestic, and more capable of as∣suming an education foreign to his
nature. The dogs of Albany, of Greece, of Denmark, and of Ireland, are larger
and stronger than those of any other kind. In France, Germany, Spain, and
Italy, the dogs are of various kinds, like the men; and this variety seems
formed by crossing the breed of such as are imported from various
climates.</P>
<P>The shepherd's dog may, therefore, be con∣sidered 
<PB N="283" REF="332"/> as the primitive stock from whence these varieties
are all derived. He makes the stem of that genealogical tree which has been
branched out into every part of the world. This animal still continues pretty
nearly in its original state among the poor in temperate climates; being
transported into the colder re∣gions, he grows less and more ugly among the
Laplanders; but becomes more perfect in Ice∣land, Russia and Siberia, where
the climate is less rigorous, and the people more civilized. What∣ever
differences there may be among the dogs of these countries, they are not very
consider∣able, as they all have strait ears, long and thick hair, a
savage aspect, and do not bark either so often or so loud as dogs of
the more cultivated kind.</P>
<P>The shepherd's dog, transported into the temperate climates, and
among people entirely civilized, such as England, France, and Ger∣many, will
be divested of his savage air, his pricked ears, his rough, long, and thick
hair, and, from the single influence of climate and food alone, will become
either a Matin, a Mastiff, or an Hound. These three seem the immediate
descendants of the former; and from them the other varieties are
produced.</P>
<P>The Hound, the Harrier, and the Beagle, <PB N="284" REF="333"/>
seem all of the same kind; for although the bitch is covered but by one of
them, yet in her litters are found puppies resembling all the three. This
animal, transported into Spain or Barbary, where the hair of all quadrupedes
be∣comes soft and long, will be there converted into the land-spaniel, and
the water-spaniel, and these of different sizes.</P>
<P>The Grey Matin Hound, which is the second branch, transported to
the north, becomes the great Danish dog; and this, sent into the south,
becomes the grey-hound, of different sizes. The same, transported into
Ireland, the Uk∣raine, Tartary, Epirus, and Albania, becomes the great wolf
dog, known by the name of the Irish wolf dog.</P>
<P>The Mastiff, which is the third branch, and chiefly a native of
England, when transported into Denmark, becomes the little Danish dog; and
this little Danish dog, sent into the tropical and warm climates, becomes
the animal called the Turkish dog, without hair. All these races, with
their varieties, are produced by the in∣fluence of climate, joined to the
different food, education, and shelter, which they have received among
mankind. All other kinds may be con∣sidered as mongrel races, produced by the
con∣currence of these, and found rather by crossing <PB N="285" REF="334"/> the breed than by attending to the individual. 
<Q REND="inline">"As these are extremely numerous, and very
different in different countries, it would be al∣most endless to mention
the whole; besides, nothing but experience can ascertain the reality of
these conjectures already made, although they have so much the appearance
of probability; and until that gives more certain information, we must be
excused from entering more minutely into the subject. 
<P>"With regard to the dogs of our country in particular, the
varieties are very great, and the number every day encreasing. And this
must happen in a country so open by commerce to all others, and where
wealth is apt to produce capricious predilection. Here the ugliest and the
most useless of their kinds will be enter∣tained merely for their
singularity; and, being imported only to be looked at, they will lose even
that small degree of sagacity which they possessed in their natural
climates. From this importation of foreign useless dogs, our own native
breed is, I am informed, greatly dege∣nerated, and the varieties now to be
found in England much more numerous than they were in the times of Queen
Elizabeth, when Doctor Caius attempted their natural history. Some of these
he mentions are no longer to be found <PB N="286" REF="335"/> among us, although
many have since been in∣troduced, by no means so serviceable as those
which have been suffered to decay.</P> 
<P>"He divides the whole race into three kinds. The first is, the
generous kind, which consists of the tarrier, the harrier, and the
blood-hound; the gaze-hound, the grey-hound, the leymmer, and the tumbler; all
these are used for hunting. Then the spaniel, the setter, and the
water-spaniel, or finder, were used for fowling; and the spaniel, gentle,
or lap-dog, for amusement. The second is the farm kind; consisting of
the shepherd's dog and the mastiff. And the third is the mongrel kind;
consisting of the wappe, the turn-spit, and the dancer. To these
va∣rieties we may add at present, the bull-dog, the Dutch mastiff, the
harlequin, the pointer, and the Dane, with a variety of lap-dogs, which, as
they are perfectly useless, may be considered as unworthy of a name.</P> 
<P>"The Tarrier is a small kind of hound<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>British Zoology.</BIBL></NOTE>, with rough hair, made
use of to force the fox or the badger out of their holes; or rather to give
notice, by their barking, in what part of their kennel the fox or badger
resides, when the sportsmen intend to dig them out.</P> 
<P>"The Harrier, as well as the beagle and the <PB N="287" REF="336"/>
fox-hound are used for hunting; of all other animals, they have the
quickest and most di∣stinguishing sense of smelling. The properly
breeding, matching, and training these, make up the business of many
men's lives.</P> 
<P>"The Blood-hound was a dog of great use, and in high esteem
among our ancestors. Its employ was to recover any game that had escaped
wounded from the hunter, or had been killed, and stolen out of the forest.
But it was still more employed in hunting thieves and rob∣bers by their
footsteps. At that time, when the country was less peopled than at
present, and when, consequently, the footsteps of one man were less
crossed and obliterated by those of others, this animal was very
serviceable in such pursuits; but at present, when the country is every
where peopled, this variety is quite worn out; probably because it was found
of less service than formerly.</P> 
<P>"The Gaze-hound hunted, like our grey-hounds, by the eye and not
by the scent. It chaced indifferently the fox, hare, or buck. It would
select from the herd the fattest and fairest deer, pursue it by the
eye, and if lost recover it again with amazing sagacity. This species is
now lost or unknown among us.</P> 
<P>"The Grey-hound is very well known at pre∣sent, 
<PB N="288" REF="337"/> and was formerly held in such estimation, that it
was the peculiar companion of a gentle∣man; who, in the times of
semi-barbarism, was known by his horse, his hawk, and his grey∣hound.
Persons under a certain rank of life are forbidden, by some late game-laws,
from keep∣ing this animal; wherefore, to disguise it the better, they cut
off its tail.</P> 
<P>"The Leymmer is a species now unknown to us. It hunted both by
scent and sight, and was led in a leyme or thong, from whence it received
its name.</P> 
<P>"The Tumbler was less than the hound, more scraggy, and had
pricked ears; so that by the description it seems to answer to the
modern lurcher. This took its prey by mere cunning, depending neither on the
goodness of its nose nor its swiftness. If it came into a warren, it
neither barked nor ran on the rabbits; but, seemingly inattentive, approached
sufficiently near till it came within reach, and then seized them by a
sudden spring.</P> 
<P>"The Land Spaniel, which probably had its name from Spain, where
it might have ac∣quired the softness of its hair, is well known at
present. There are two varieties of this kind; namely, the Slater, used in
hawking to spring the game; and the Setter, that crouches down 
<PB N="289" REF="338"/> when it scents the birds, till the net be drawn over
them. I have read somewhere that the famous poet, Lord Surry, was the first
who taught dogs to set; it being an amusement to this day only known in
England.</P> 
<P>"The Water Spaniel was another species used in fowling. This
seems to be the most docile of all the dog kind; and this docility is
particularly owing to his natural attachment to man. Many other kinds will not
bear correc∣tion; but this patient creature, though very fierce to strangers,
seems unalterable in his af∣fections; and blows and ill usage seem only
to encrease his regard.</P> 
<P>"The Lap-dog, at the time of Doctor Caius, was of Maltese breed;
at present it comes from different countries; in general, the more auk∣ward
or extraordinary these are, the more they are prized.</P> 
<P>"The Shepherd's dog has been already men∣tioned, and as for the
mastiff he is too common to require a description. Doctor Caius tells us,
that three of these were reckoned a match for a bear, and four for a lion.
However, we are told that three of them overcame a lion in the times of King
James the First; two of them being disabled in the combat, the third
obliged the lion to seek for safety by slight.</P> 
<P><PB N="290" REF="339"/>"As to the last division, namely, of the
Wappe, the Turn-spit, and the Dancer, these were mongrels, of no certain
shape, and made use of only to alarm the family, or, being taught a variety
of tricks, were carried about as a show.</P> 
<P>"With regard to those of later importation, the Bull-dog, as Mr.
Buffon supposes, is a breed between the small Dane and the English
mastiff. The large Dane is the tallest dog that is generally bred in
England. It is somewhat between a mastiff and a grey-hound in shape,
being more slender than the one and much stronger than the other. They are
chiefly used rather for shew than service, being neither good in the yard
nor the field. The highest are most esteemed; and they generally cut off
their ears to improve their figure, as some absurdly sup∣pose. The
harlequin is not much unlike the small Dane, being an useless animal,
somewhat between an Italian grey-hound and a Dutch mastiff. To these
several others might be added, such as the pug dog, the black breed, and
the pointer; but, in fact, the varieties are so nu∣merous as to fatigue even
the most ardent cu∣riosity."</P> </Q></P>
<P>Of these of the foreign kinds, I shall mention only three, which
are more remarkable than any of the rest. The Lion Dog greatly re∣sembles 
<PB N="291" REF="340"/> that animal, in miniature, from whence it takes the
name. The hair of the fore part of its body is extremely long, while that of
the hinder part is as short. The nose is short, the tail long, and tufted
at the point, so that in all these particulars it is entirely like the
lion. However, it differs very much from that fierce animal in nature and
disposition, being one of the smallest animals of its kind, extremely
feeble, timid, and inactive. It comes originally from Malta, where it is found
so small that women carry it about in their sleeves.</P>
<P>That animal falsely called the Turkish Dog, differs greatly from
all the rest of the kind, in being entirely without hair. The skin, which
is perfectly bare, is of a flesh colour, with brown spots; and their figure
at first view is rather disgusting. These seem to be of the small
Danish breed, brought into a warm climate, and there, by a succession
of generations, di∣vested of their hair. For this reason, they are
extremely chilly, and unable to endure the cold of our climate; and even in the
midst of sum∣mer they continue to shiver as we see men in a frosty
day. Their spots are brown, as was said, well marked, and easily
distinguishable in sum∣mer, but in the cold of winter they entirely
disappear. They are called the Turkish breed, <PB N="292" REF="341"/>
although brought from a much warmer climate; for some of them have been known
to come from the warmest parts of Africa and the East-Indies.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">"The last variety, and the most wonderful of all
that I shall mention, is the Great Irish Wolf Dog; that may be considered
as the first of the canine species. This animal, which is very rare even in
the only country in the world where it is to be found, is rather kept for
shew than use, there being neither wolves nor any other formidable beasts
of prey in Ireland, that seem to require so powerful an antagonist. The
wolf dog is therefore bred up in the houses of the great, or such gentlemen
as chuse to keep him as a curiosity, being neither good for hunt∣ing the
hare, the fox, or the stag, and equally unserviceable as an house dog.
Nevertheless, he is extremely beautiful and majestic to ap∣pearance, being
the greatest of the dog kind to be seen in the world. The largest of
those I have seen, and I have seen above a dozen, was about four feet
high, or as tall as a calf of a year old. He was made extremely like a
grey∣hound, but rather more robust, and inclining to the figure of the French
matin, or the great Dane. His eye was mild, his colour white, and his nature
seemed heavy and phlegmatic. This I ascribed to his having been bred up to
a <PB N="293" REF="342"/> size beyond his nature; for we see in man, and all
other animals, that such as are overgrown are neither so vigorous nor alert
as those of more moderate stature. The greatest pains had been taken with
these to enlarge the breed, both by food and matching. This end was
ef∣fectually obtained, indeed; for the size was enormous; but, as it seemed
to me, at the ex∣pence of the animal's fierceness, vigilance, and sagacity.
However, I was informed otherwise; the gentleman who bred them assuring
me that a mastiff would be nothing when opposed to one of them, who
generally seized their antagonist by the back: he added, that they would
worry the strongest bull-dogs, in a few minutes, to death. But this
strength did not appear either in their figure or their inclinations; they
seemed rather more timid than the ordinary race of dogs; and their skin was
much thinner, and consequently less fitted for combat. Whether with these
dis∣advantages they were capable, as I was told, of singly coping with
bears, others may deter∣mine; however, they have but few oppor∣tunities, in
their own country, of exerting their strength, as all wild carnivorous
animals there are only of the vermin kind. Mr. Buffon seems to be of opinion
that these are the true Molos∣sian dogs of the ancients; he gives no
reason <PB N="294" REF="343"/> for this opinion; and I am apt to think it ill
grounded. Not to trouble the reader with a tedious critical disquisition,
which I have all along avoided, it will be sufficient to observe, that
Nemesianus, in giving directions for the choice of a bitch, advises to have
one of Spartan or Molossian breed; and among several other perfections,
he says that the ears should be dependent, and fluctuate as she runs<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"> 
<Q> 
<L>Elige tunc cursu facilem, facilemque recursu,</L> 
<L>In Lacedaemonio natam seu rure Molosso.—</L> 
<L>Renibus ampla satis validis, diductaque coxas</L> 
<L>Cui que nimis molles fluitent in cursibur aures.</L> 
<BIBL>NEMESIAN.</BIBL></Q></NOTE>. This, however, is by no
means the case with the Irish wolf dog, whose ears resemble those of
the grey-hound, and are far from fluctuating with the animal's motions. But of
whatever kinds these dogs may be, whether known among the ancients, or
whether produced by a later mixture, they are now almost quite worn away, and
are very rarely to be met with even in Ire∣land. If carried to other countries,
they soon degenerate; and even at home, unless great care be taken, they
quickly alter. They were once employed in clearing the island of wolves,
which infested it in great plenty; but these being destroyed, the dogs
also are wearing <PB N="295" REF="344"/> away, as if Nature meant to blot out
the species when they had no longer any services to per∣form. 
<P>"In this manner several kinds of animals fade from the face of
nature that were once well known, but are now seen no longer. The enormous
elk of the same kingdom, that, by its horns, could not have been less than
eleven feet high, the wolf, and even the wolf-dog, are extinct, or only
continued in such a manner as to prove their former plenty and existence.
From hence it is probable that many of the nobler kinds of dogs, of which the
ancients have given us such beautiful descriptions, are now utterly
unknown; since among the whole breed we have not one that will venture to
en∣gage the lion or the tiger in single combat. The English bull-dog is
perhaps the bravest of the kind; but what are his most boasted ex∣ploits
to those mentioned of the Epirotic dogs by Pliny, or the Indian dogs by
Aelian. The latter gives us a description of a combat between a dog and a
lion, which I will take leave to translate.</P> 
<P>"When Alexander was pursuing his conquests in India, one of
the principal men or that country was desirous of shewing him the value of
the dogs which his country produced. <PB N="296" REF="345"/> Bringing his dog
into the king's presence, he ordered a stag to be let loose before him,
which the dog, despising as an unworthy enemy, re∣mained quite regardless
of the animal, and never once stirred from his place. His master then
ordered a wild boar to be set out; but the dog thought even this a
despicable foe, and re∣mained calm and regardless as before. He was next
tried with a bear; but still despising his ene∣my, he only waited for an
object more worthy of his courage and his force. At last, they brought forth
a tremendous lion, and then the dog ac∣knowledged his antagonist, and
prepared for combat. He instantly discovered a degree of ungovernable
ardour; and, flying at the lion with fury, seized him by the throat, and
totally disabled him from resistance Upon this, the Indian, who was
desirous of surprizing the king, and knowing the constancy and bravery of
his dog, ordered his tail to be cut off; which was easily performed as the
bold animal was em∣ployed in holding the lion. He next ordered one of his legs
to be broken; which, however, did not in the least abate the dog's ardour,
but he still kept his hold as before. Another leg was then broken; but the
dog, as if he had suffered no pain, only pressed the lion still the
more. In this cruel manner, all his legs were <PB N="297" REF="346"/> cut off,
without abating his courage; and at last, when even his head was separated
from his body, the jaws seemed to keep their for∣mer hold. A sight so
cruel did not fail to affect the king with very strong emotions, at once
pitying the dog's fate and admiring his forti∣tude. Upon which the Indian,
seeing him thus moved, presented him with four dogs of the same kind,
which in some measure alleviated his uneasiness for the loss of the
former.</P> "The breed of dogs, however, in that country, is at present very
much inferior to what this story seems to imply; since, in many places,
instead of dogs, they have animals of the cat kind for hunting. In other
places also, this ad∣mirable and faithful animal, instead of being applied
to his natural uses, is only kept to be eaten. All over China there are
dog-butchers, and shambles appointed for selling their flesh. In Canton,
particularly, there is a street ap∣pointed for that purpose; and what is
very ex∣traordinary, wherever a dog-butcher appears, all the dogs of the place
are sure to be in full cry after him; they know their enemy, and persecute
him as far as they are able."</Q> Along the coasts of Guinea, their flesh
is esteemed a delicacy by the Negroes; and they will give one of their cows
for a dog. But, among this bar∣barous <PB N="298" REF="347"/> and brutal people,
scarce any thing that has life comes amiss; and they may well take up with
a dog, since they consider toads, lizards, and even the flesh of the
tiger itself, as a dainty. It may perhaps happen that the flesh of this
animal, which is so indifferent in the temperate climates, may assume a
better quality in those which are more warm; but it is more than probable
that the diversity is ra∣ther in man than in the flesh of the dog; since
in the cold countries the flesh is eaten with equal appetite by the
savages; and they have their dog-feasts in the same manner as we have
ours for venison.</P>
<P>In our climate, the wild animals that most approach the dog are
the wolf and the fox; these in their internal conformation greatly
re∣semble each other, and yet in their natures are very distinct. The
ancients asserted that they bred together; and I am assured by credible
persons that there are many animals in this country bred between a dog and a
fox. How∣ever, all the endeavours of Mr. Buffon to make them engender, as he
assures us, were inef∣fectual. For this purpose, he bred up a young wolf,
taken in the woods, at two months old, with a matin dog of the same age. They
were shut up together, without any other, in a large <PB N="299" REF="348"/>
yard, where they had a shelter for retiring. They neither of them knew any
other indi∣vidual of their kind, nor even any other man but he who had the
charge of feeding them. In this manner they were kept for three years; still
with the same attention, and without con∣straining or tying them up. During
the first year the young animals played with each other continually, and
seemed to love each other very much. In the second year they began to
dispute about their victuals, although they were given more than they could
use. The quarrel always began on the wolf's side. They were brought their
food, which consisted of flesh and bones, upon a large wooden platter,
which was laid on the ground. Just as it was put down, the wolf, instead of
falling to the meat, began by driving off the dog; and took the platter in his
teeth so expertly, that he let nothing of what it con∣tained fall upon the
ground; and in this man∣ner carried it off; but as he could not entirely
escape, he was frequently seen to run with it round the yard five or six
times, still carrying it in a position that none of its contents could
fall. In this manner it would continue running, only now and then stopping to
take breath, until the dog coming up, the wolf would leave the victuals to
attack him. The dog, however, <PB N="300" REF="349"/> was the stronger of the
two; but as it was more gentle, in order to secure him from the wolf's
attack, he had a collar put round his neck. In the third year, the quarrels of
these ill paired associates were more vehement, and their com∣bats more
frequent; the wolf, therefore, had a collar put about its neck, as well as the
dog, who began to be more fierce and unmerciful. During the two first years,
neither seemed to testify the least tendency towards engendering; and it
was not till the end of the third, that the wolf, which was the female,
shewed the natural desire, but without abating either in its fierce∣ness
or obstinacy. This appetite rather en∣creased than repressed their
mutual animosity; they became every day more intractable and ferocious, and
nothing was heard between them but the sounds of rage and resentment. They
both, in less than three weeks, became remark∣ably lean, without ever
approaching each other, but to combat. At length, their quarrels be∣came so
desperate, that the dog killed the wolf, who was become more weak and feeble;
and he was soon after himself obliged to be killed, for, upon being set
at liberty, he instantly flew upon every animal he met, fowls, dogs, and even
men themselves not escaping his savage fury.</P>
<P><PB N="301" REF="350"/>The same experiment was tried upon foxes,
taken young, but with no better success, they were never found to engender
with dogs; and our learned naturalist seems to be of opinion that their
natures are too opposite ever to pro∣voke mutual desire. One thing,
however, must be remarked, that the animals on which he tried his
experiments, were rather too old when taken, and had partly acquired their
natural savage appetites, before they came into his pos∣session. The
wolf, as he acknowledges, was two or three months old before it was caught, and
the foxes were taken in traps. It may, therefore, be easily supposed,
that nothing could ever after thoroughly tame those creatures, that had been
suckled in the wild state, and had caught all the habitudes of the dam. I
have seen these animals, when taken earlier in the woods, become very tame;
and, indeed, they rather were displeasing by being too familiar than too
shy. It were to be wished that the experiment were tried upon such as
these; and it is more than probable that it would produce the desired
success. Nevertheless, these expe∣riments are sufficient to prove
that neither the wolf nor the fox are of the same nature with the dog, but
each of a species perfectly distinct, <PB N="302" REF="351"/> and their
joint produce most probably un∣fruitful.</P>
<P>The dog, when first whelped, is not a com∣pletely finished
animal. In this kind, as in all the rest which bring forth many at a time,
the young are not so perfect as in those which bring forth but one or two.
They are always produced with the eyes closed, the lids being held together,
not by sticking, but by a kind of thin membrane, which is torn as soon as
the upper eye-lid becomes strong enough to raise it from the under. In
general, their eyes are not opened till ten or twelve days old. Dur∣ing that
time, the bones of the scull are not completed, the body is puffed up, the
nose is short, and the whole form but ill sketched out. In less than a
month the puppy begins to use all its senses; and, from thence, makes
hasty advances to its perfection. At the fourth month the dog loses some
of his teeth, as in other animals, and these are renewed by such as never
fall. The number of these amount to forty-two, which is twelve more than is
found in any of the cat kind, which are known never to have above thirty. The
teeth of the dog being his great and only weapon, are formed in a manner much
more serviceable than those of the former; and there is scarce any
quadru∣pede <PB N="303" REF="352"/> that has a greater facility in rending,
cutting, or chewing its food. He cuts with his incisors, or fore-teeth, he
holds with his four great canine teeth, and he chews his meat with his
grinders; these are fourteen in number, and so placed that, when the jaws
are shut, there remains a distance between them, so that the dog, by
opening his mouth ever so wide, does not lose the power of his jaws. But it
is other∣wise in the cat kind, whose incisors or cutting teeth are very
small, and whose grinding teeth, when brought together, touch more
closely than those of the dog, and, consequently, have less power.
Thus, for instance, I can squeeze any thing more forcibly between my thumb
and fore finger, where the distance is greater, than between any other two
fingers, whose distance from each other is less.</P>
<P>This animal is capable of reproducing at the age of twelve
months<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">To this description I will beg leave to add a
few par∣ticulars from Linnaeus, as I find them in the original.

and lives to about the age of twelve. <PB N="304" REF="353"/> Few quadrupedes
are less delicate in their food; and yet there are many kinds of birds which
the dog will not venture to touch. He is even known, although in a savage
state, to abstain from injuring some which one might suppose he had
every reason to oppose. The dogs and the vultures which live wild about
Grand Cairo in Egypt, (for the Mahometan law has expelled this useful animal
from human society) continue together in a very sociable and friendly
manner<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Hasselquist Her. Palaestin, p.
232.</BIBL></NOTE>. As they are both useful in devouring such carcases as
might otherwise pu∣trefy, and thus infect the air, the inhabitants supply
them with provisions every day, in order to keep them near the city. Upon
these oc∣casions, the quadrupedes and birds are often seen together
tearing the same piece of flesh, without the least enmity; on the
contrary, they are known to live together with a kind of af∣fection, and bring
up their young in the same nest.</P>
<P>Although the dog is a voracious animal, yet he can bear hunger for a
very long time. We have an instance, in the Memoirs of the Aca∣demy of
Sciences, of this kind, in which a bitch that had been forgotten in a
country-house, lived forty days, without any other nourishment 
<PB N="305" REF="354"/> than the wool of a quilt which she had torn in pieces.
It should seem that water is more ne∣cessary to the dog than food; he
drinks often, though not abundantly; and it is commonly be∣lieved, that when
abridged in water, he runs mad. This dreadful malady, the consequences of
which are so well known, is the greatest in∣convenience that results from
the keeping this faithful domestic. But it is a disorder by no means so
frequent as the terrors of the ti∣morous would suppose; the dog has been
often accused of madness, without a fair trial; and some persons have
been supposed to receive their deaths from his bite, when either their own
ill-grounded fears, or their natural dis∣orders were the true cause.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>THE WOLF.</HEAD>
<P>THE dog and the wolf are so very much alike internally, that the
most expert anatomists can scarce perceive the difference; and it may be
asserted also, that, externally, some dogs more nearly resemble the
wolf than they do each other. It was this strong similitude that first
led some naturalists to consider them as the same animal, and to look
upon the wolf as the dog in its state of savage freedom: however, 
<PB N="306" REF="355"/> this opinion is entertained no longer; the na∣tural
antipathy those two animals bear to each other; the longer time which the
wolf goes with young than the dog, the one going over an hundred days, and the
other not quite sixty; the longer period of life in the former than the
latter, the wolf living twenty years, the dog not fifteen; all sufficiently
point out a di∣stinction, and draw a line that must for ever keep them
asunder.</P>
<P>The wolf, from the tip of the nose, to the insertion of the
tail, is about three feet seven inches long, and about two feet five inches
high; which shews him to be larger than our great breed of mastiffs, which
are seldom found to be above three feet by two. His colour is a mixture of
black, brown, and grey, extremely rough and hard, but mixed towards the roots
with a kind of ash coloured fur. In comparing him to any of our well known
breed of dogs, the great Dane, or mongrel greyhound, for in∣stance, he will
appear to have the legs shorter, the head larger, the muzzle thicker, the
eyes smaller and more separated from each other, and the ears shorter and
straiter. He appears, in every respect, stronger than the dog; and the
length of his hair contributes still more to his robust appearance. The
feature which prin∣cipally <PB N="307" REF="356"/> distinguishes the
visage of the wolf from that of the dog, is the eye, which opens
slant∣ingly upwards, in the same direction with the nose; whereas, in the
dog, it opens more at right angles with the nose, as in man. The tail also,
in this animal, is long and bushy; and he carries it rather more between his
hind legs than the dog is seen to do. The colour of the eye-balls in the wolf
are of a fiery green, and give his visage a fierce and formidable air, which
his natural disposition does by no means contradict<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The rest of this history of the wolf is taken from Mr. Buffon,
and I look upon it as a complete model for natural history. If I add or
differ, I mark it as usual.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The wolf is one of those animals whose ap∣petite for animal
food is the most vehement; and whose means of satisfying this appetite
are the most various. Nature has furnished him with strength, cunning,
agility, and all those requisites which fit an animal for pursuing,
overtaking, and conquering its prey; and yet, with all these, the wolf most
frequently dies of hunger, for he is the declared enemy of man. Being long
proscribed, and a reward offered for his head, he is obliged to fly from
human habitations, and to live in the forest, where the few wild animals to
be found there, escape him <PB N="308" REF="357"/> either by their
swiftness or their art; or are sup∣plied in too small a proportion to
satisfy his rapacity. He is naturally dull and cowardly; but frequently
disappointed, and as often re∣duced to the verge of famine, he becomes
in∣genious from want, and courageous from ne∣cessity. When pressed with
hunger, he braves danger, and comes to attack those animals which are under
the protection of man, parti∣cularly such as he can readily carry away,
lambs, sheep, or even dogs themselves, for all animal food comes then
equally agreeable. When this excursion has succeeded, he often returns to
the charge, until having been wounded or hard pressed by the dogs, or the
shepherds, he hides himself by day in the thickest coverts, and only
ventures out at night; he then sallies forth over the country, keeps peering
round the villages, carries off such animals as are not under protection,
at∣tacks the sheep-folds, scratches up and under∣mines the thresholds of
doors where they are housed, enters furious, and destroys all before he
begins to six upon and carry off his prey. When these sallies do not
succeed, he then re∣turns to the thickest part of the forest, content to
pursue those smaller animals, which, even when taken, afford him but a
scanty supply. <PB N="309" REF="358"/> He there goes regularly to work,
follows by the scent, opens to the view, still keeps follow∣ing, hopeless
himself of overtaking the prey, but expecting that some other wolf will
come into his assistance, and then content to share the spoil. At
last, when his necessities are very urgent, he boldly faces certain
destruction; he attacks women and children, and sometimes ventures even to
fall upon men, becomes furious by his continual agitations, and ends his life
in madness.</P>
<P>The wolf, as well externally as internally, so nearly
resembles the dog, that he seems mo∣delled upon the same plan; and yet he
only offers the reverse of the medal. If his form be like, his nature is so
different, that he only preserves the ill qualities of the dog, without any
of his good ones. Indeed, they are so different in their dispositions,
that no two animals can have a more perfect antipathy to each other. A young
dog shudders at the sight of a wolf; he even shuns his scent, which,
though unknown, is so repugnant to his nature, that he comes trembling to
take protection near his master. A dog who is stronger, and who knows his
strength, bristles up at the sight, testifies his animosity, attacks
him with courage, endeavours to put him to slight, and does all in his power 
<PB N="310" REF="359"/> to rid himself of a presence that is hateful to him.
They never meet without either flying or fight∣ing; fighting for life and
death, and without mercy on either side. If the wolf is the stronger, he
tears and devours his prey: the dog, on the contrary, is more generous, and
contents himself with his victory; he does not seem to think that 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>the body of a dead enemy smells
well;</HI></Q> he leaves him where he falls, to serve as food for birds of
prey, or for other wolves, since they devour each other; and when one wolf
happens to be desperately wounded, the rest track him by his blood, and are
sure to shew him no mercy.</P>
<P>The dog, even in his savage state, is not cruel; he is
easily tamed, and continues firmly attached to his master. The wolf, when
taken young, becomes tame, but never has an at∣tachment; nature is stronger
in him than edu∣cation; he resumes, with age, his natural dis∣positions,
and returns, as soon as he can, to the woods from whence he was taken. Dogs,
even of the dullest kinds, seek the company of other animals; they are
naturally disposed to follow and accompany other creatures beside
them∣selves; and even by instinct, without any edu∣cation, take to the care
of flocks and herds. The wolf, on the contrary, is the enemy of all 
<PB N="311" REF="360"/> society; he does not even keep much company with
those of his kind. When they are seen in packs together, it is not to be
considered as a peaceful society, but a combination for war: they testify
their hostile intentions by their loud howlings, and by their fierceness
discover a pro∣ject for attacking some great animal, such as a stag or
a bull, or to destroy some more redoubt∣able watch-dog. The instant their
military ex∣pedition is completed, their society is at an end; they then
part, and each returns in silence to his solitary retreat. There is not
even any strong attachments between the male and female; they seek each
other only once a year, and re∣main but a few days together: they always couple
in winter; at which time several males are seen following one female, and
this association is still more bloody than the former: they dis∣pute
most cruelly, growl, bark, fight, and tear each other; and it sometimes
happens that the majority kill the wolf which has been chiefly preferred by the
female. It is usual for the she wolf to fly from them all with him she
has chosen; and watches this opportunity when the rest are asleep.</P>
<P>The season for coupling does not continue above twelve or
fifteen days; and usually com∣mences among the oldest, those which are 
<PB N="312" REF="361"/> young being later in their desires. The males have no
fixed time for engendering; they pass from one female to the other, beginning
at the end of December, and ending at the latter end of February. The time of
pregnancy is about three months and an half; and the young wolves are found
from the latter end of April to the beginning of July. The long continuance of
the wolf's pregnancy is sufficient to make a distinction between it and the
dog; did not also the fiery fierceness of the eyes, the howl instead of
barking, and the greater duration of its life, leave no doubt of its being an
animal of its own particular species. In other respects, however, they are
entirely alike; the wolf couples exactly like the dog, the parts are formed in
the same manner, and their separation hindered by the same cause. When
the she-wolves are near their time of bringing forth, they seek some very
tufted spot, in the thickest part of the fo∣rest; in the middle of this
they make a small opening, cutting away the thorns and briars with their
teeth, and afterwards carry thither a great quantity of moss, which they form
into a bed for their young ones. They generally bring forth five or six, and
sometimes even to nine at a litter. The cubs are brought forth, like those
of the bitch, with the eyes closed; <PB N="313" REF="362"/> the dam suckles
them for some weeks, and teaches them betimes to eat flesh, which she
prepares for them, by chewing it first herself. Some time after she
brings them stronger food, hares, partridges, and birds yet alive. The young
wolves begin by playing with them, and end by killing them. The dam then
strips them of their feathers, tears them in pieces, and gives to each of
them a share. They do not leave the den where they have been littered, till
they are six weeks, or two months old. They then follow the old one, who
leads them to drink to the trunk of some old tree where the water has
settled, or at some pool in the neigh∣bourhood. If she apprehends any
danger, she instantly conceals them in the first convenient place, or
brings them back to their former retreat. In this manner they follow her for
some months; when they are attacked, she de∣fends them with all her
strength, and more than usual ferocity. Although, at other times, more
timorous than the male, at that season she becomes bold and fearless;
willing perhaps to teach the young ones future courage by her own example. It
is not till they are about ten or twelve months old, and until they have shed
their first teeth, and completed the new, that she thinks them in a
capacity to shift for them∣selves. <PB N="314" REF="363"/> Then when they
have acquired arms from nature, and have learned industry and courage from
her example, she declines all future care of them, being again engaged in
bringing up a new progeny.</P>
<P>The males and females are in a capacity to engender when two years
old. It is probable that the females of this species, as well as of most
others, are sooner completed than the males; but this is certain, that they
never desire to copulate until their second winter; from whence we may
suppose that they live fifteen or twenty years; for allowing three years
for their complete growth, this multiplied by seven gives them a life of
twenty-one; most animals, as has been observed, living about seven times
the number of years which they take to come to perfection. Of this, however,
there is as yet no certainty, no more than of what hunts∣men assert, that
in all the litters there are more males than females. From them also we learn
that there are some of the males who attach themselves to the female, who
accompany her during her gestation, until the time of bringing forth, when
she hides the place of her retreat from the male, lest he should devour
her cubs. But after this, when they are brought forth, that the then takes the
same care of them as the <PB N="315" REF="364"/> female, carries them
provisions, and, if the dam should happen to be killed, rears them up in
her stead.</P>
<P>The wolf grows grey as he grows old, and his teeth wear, like
those of most other ani∣mals, by using. He sleeps when his belly is
full, or when he is fatigued, rather by day than night; and always, like the
dog, is very easily waked. He drinks frequently; and in times of drought,
when there is no water to be found in the trunks of old trees, or in the pools
about the forest, he comes often, in the day, down to the brooks, or the
lakes in the plain. Although very voracious, he supports hunger for a long
time, and often lives four or five days without food, provided he be supplied
with water.</P>
<P>The wolf has great strength, particularly in his fore-parts, in
the muscles of his neck and his jaws. He carries off a sheep in his mouth
without letting it touch the ground, and runs with it much swifter than the
shepherds who pursue him; so that nothing but the dogs can overtake, and
oblige him to quit his prey. He bites cruelly, and always with greater
vehe∣mence in proportion as he his least resisted; for he uses
precautions with such animals as attempt to stand upon the defensive. He
is ever cow∣ardly, <PB N="316" REF="365"/> and never fights but when under a
ne∣cessity of satisfying hunger, or making good his retreat. When he is
wounded by a bullet, he is heard to cry out; and yet, when sur∣rounded by the
peasants, and attacked with clubs, he never howls as the dog under
correc∣tion, but defends himself in silence, and dies as hard as he
lived.</P>
<P>His nature is, in fact, more savage than that of the dog; he has
less sensibility and greater strength. He travels, runs, and keeps
plun∣dering for whole days and nights together. He is in a manner
indefatigable; and perhaps of all animals he is the most difficult to be
hunted down. The dog is good natured and coura∣geous; the wolf, though
savage, is ever fearful. If he happens to be caught in a pit-fall, he is for
some time so frightened and astonished, that he may be killed without
offering to resist, or taken alive without much danger. At that instant,
one may clap a collar round his neck, muzzle him, and drag him along, without
his ever giving the least signs of anger or resent∣ment. At all other
times he has his senses in great perfection; his eye, his car, and
parti∣cularly his sense of smelling, which is even su∣perior to the two
former. He smells a carcase at more than a league's distance; he also
per∣ceives <PB N="317" REF="366"/> living animals a great way off, and fol∣lows
them a long time upon the scent. When∣ever he leaves the wood, he always
takes care to go out against the wind. When just come to its extremity, he
stops to examine, by his smell, on all sides, the emanations that may
come either from his enemy or his prey, which he very nicely distinguishes.
He prefers those animals which he kills himself to those he finds dead;
and yet he does not disdain these when no better is to be had. He is
particularly fond of human flesh; and perhaps, if he were suf∣ficiently
powerful, he would eat no other. Wolves have been seen following armies, and
arriving in numbers upon the field of battle, where they devoured such dead
bodies as were left upon the field, or but negligently interred. These, when
once accustomed to human flesh, ever after seek particularly to attack
mankind, and chuse to fall upon the shepherd rather than his flock. We have
had a late instance of two or three of these keeping a whole province, for
more than a month, in a continual alarm.</P>
<P>It sometimes happens that a whole country is called out to
extirpate these most dangerous invaders. The hunting the wolf is a
favourite diversion among the great of some countries; and it must be
confessed it seems to be the most <PB N="318" REF="367"/> useful of
any. These animals are distinguished by the huntsmen into the <HI>young
wolf,</HI> the <HI>old wolf,</HI> and the <HI>great wolf.</HI> They are known
by the prints of their feet; the older the wolf, the larger the track he
leaves. That of the female is narrower and longer than that of the male. It is
necessary to have a very good starter to put up the wolf; and it is even
convenient to use every art to encourage him in his pursuit; for all dogs
have a natural repugnance against this animal, and are but cold in their
endeavours. When the wolf is once put up, it is then proper to have grey-hounds
to let fly at him, in leashes, one after the other. The first leash is
sent after him in the beginning, seconded by a man on horse-back; the
second are let loose about half a mile farther, and the third when the
rest of the dogs come up with, and begin to bait him. He for a long time
keeps them off, stands his ground, threatens them on all sides, and often
gets away; but usually the hunters arriving come in aid of the dog, and help
to dispatch him with their cutlasses. When the animal is killed, the dogs
testify no appetite to enjoy their victory, but leave him where he falls, a
frightful spectacle, and even in death hideous.</P>
<P>The wolf is sometimes also hunted with har∣riers, but as he
always goes straight forward, <PB N="319" REF="368"/> and often holds his
speed for a whole day toge∣ther, this kind of chace is tedious and
disagree∣able, at least if the harriers are not assisted by grey
hounds, who may harrass him at every view. Several other arts have been
also used to take and destroy this noxious animal. He is sur∣rounded
and wounded by men and large house-dogs; he is secured in traps; he is
poisoned by carcases prepared and placed for that purpose, and is caught
in pit-falls. 
<Q REND="inline">"Gesner tells us of a friar, a woman, and a
wolf, being taken in one of these, all in the same night. The woman lost
her senses with the fright, the friar his re∣putation, and the wolf his
life."</Q> All these disasters, however, do not prevent this animal's
multiplying in great numbers, particularly in countries where the woods are
plenty. France, Spain, and Italy, are great infested with them; but England,
Ireland, and Scotland, are hap∣pily set free.</P>
<P>King Edgar is said to be the first who at∣tempted to rid this
kingdom of such disagree∣able inmates, by commuting the punishment for
certain crimes into the acceptance of a number of wolf's tongues from each
criminal<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>British Zoology, p. 62.</BIBL></NOTE>.
However, some centuries after, these animals were again encreased to
such a degree, as to become the <PB N="320" REF="369"/> object of royal
attention; accordingly Edward the First issued out his mandate to one
Peter Corbet to superintend and assist in the destruc∣tion of them.
They are said to have infested Ireland long after they were extirpated in
Eng∣land; however, the oldest men in that country remember nothing of these
animals; and it is probable that there have been none there for more than a
century past. Scotland also is to∣tally free.</P>
<P>The colour of this animal differs according to the different
climates where it is bred, and often changes even in the same country.
Beside the common wolves, which are found in France and Germany, there are
others with thicker hair, inclining to yellow. These are more sa∣vage and
less noxious than the former, neither approaching the flocks nor habitations,
and living rather by the chace than rapine. In the northern climates they are
found some quite black, and some white all over. The former are larger and
stronger than those of any other kinds.</P>
<P>The species is very much diffused in every part of the world,
being found in Asia, Africa, and in America, as well as Europe. The wolves of
Senegal resemble those of France, except that they are larger and much
fiercer than those <PB N="321" REF="370"/> of Europe. Those of Egypt are
smaller than those of Greece. In the east, the wolf is trained up for a
shew, being taught to dance and play tricks; and one of these thus educated
often sells for four or five hundred crowns. 
<Q REND="inline">"It is said that in Lapland the wolf will never
attack a rein-deer that is seen haltered; for this wary animal, being well
acquainted with the nature of a trap, suspects one wherever it perceives a
rope. However, when he sees the deer entirely at liberty, he seldom fails
to destroy it. 
<P>"The wolf of North America is blacker and much less than
those in other parts of the world, and approaches nearer in form to the dog
than those of the ordinary kind<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Brookes's
Natural History, vol. 1. p. 198.</BIBL></NOTE>. In fact, they were made use
of as such by the savages till the Europeans introduced others; and even
now, on the remoter shores, or the more inland parts of the country, the
savages still make use of these animals in hunting. They are very tame
and gentle; and those of this kind that are wild are neither so large nor
so fierce as an European wolf, nor do they ever attack mankind. They go
together in large packs by night to hunt the deer, which they do as well as any
dogs in England; and it is confidently asserted that one 
<PB N="322" REF="371"/> of them is sufficient to run down a deer<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Dictionaire Raisonée. Loup.</BIBL></NOTE>. Whenever
they are seen along the banks of those rivers near which the wandering
natives pitch their huts, it is taken for granted that the bison or the deer
are not far off; and the savages affirm that the wolves come with the
tidings, in order to have the garbage, after the animal has been killed by the
hunters. Catesby adds a circumstance relative to these ani∣mals, which,
if true, invalidates many of Mr. Buffon's observations in the foregoing
history. He asserts, that these being the only dogs used by the
Americans, before the arrival of the Europeans among them, they have since
en∣gendered together, and that their breed has become prolific; which proves
the dog and the wolf to be of the same species. It were to be wished that
this fact were better ascertained; we should then know to a certainty in
what a degree the dog and wolf resemble each other, as well in nature as in
conformation; we might then, perhaps, be enabled to improve the breed of our
dogs, by bringing them back to their native forms and instincts; we might, by
crossing the strain, restore that race of those bold animals, which
the ancients assure us were more than a match for the lion."</P></Q></P>

North-America; the wolf of Europe is a very noxious animal, and scarce any
thing belonging to him is good, except his skin. Of this the furrier's make a
covering that is warm and durable, though coarse and unsightly. His flesh
is very indifferent, and seems to be disliked by all other animals, no
other creature being known to eat the wolf's flesh except the wolf himself.
He breathes a most foetid vapour from his jaws, as his food is
indiscriminate, often putrid, and seldom cleanly. In short, every way
offensive, a savage aspect, a frightful howl, an insupportable odour, a
perverse disposition, fierce habits, he is hateful while living, and

<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>THE FOX.</HEAD>
<P>THE Fox very exactly resembles the wolf and the dog internally;
and, although he differs greatly from both in size and carriage, yet when we
come to examine his shapes minutely, there will appear to be very little
difference in the description. Were, for instance, a painter to draw from a
natural historian's exactest de∣scription the figure of a dog, a wolf,
and a fox, without having ever seen either, he would be very apt to confound
all these animals together; or rather he would be unable to catch those
pe∣culiar <PB N="324" REF="376"/> out-lines that no description can supply.
Words will never give any person an exact idea of forms any way irregular;
for although they be extremely just and precise, yet the number∣less
discriminations to be attended to will con∣found each other, and we shall
no more conceive the precise form than we should be able to tell when one
pebble more was added or taken away from a thousand. To conceive, therefore,
how the fox differs in form from the wolf or the dog, it is necessary to
see all three, or at least to supply the defects of description by
ex∣amining the difference in a print.</P>
<P>The fox is of a slenderer make than the wolf, and not near so
large; for as the former is above three feet and a half long, so the other is
not above two feet three inches. The tail of the fox also is longer in
proportion and more bushy; its nose is smaller and approaching more
nearly to that of the grey-hound, and its hair softer. On the other hand, it
differs from the dog in having its eyes obliquely situated, like those of
the wolf; its ears are directed also in the same manner as those of the
wolf, and its head is equally large in proportion to its size. It differs
still more from the dog in its strong offensive smell, which is
peculiar to the species, and often the cause of their death. However,
some are igno∣rantly of opinion that it will keep off infectious 
<PB N="325" REF="377"/> diseases, and they preserve this animal near their
habitations for that very purpose.</P>
<P>The fox has since the beginning been famous for his cunning and
his arts, and he partly merits his reputation<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon, Renard.</BIBL></NOTE>. Without attempting to
op∣pose either the dogs or the shepherds, without attacking the flock, or
alarming the village, he finds an easier way to subsist, and gains by
his address what is denied to his strength or courage. Patient and prudent,
he waits the opportunity for depredation, and varies his con∣duct with every
occasion. His whole study is his preservation; although nearly as
indefati∣gable, and actually more swift than the wolf, he does not entirely
trust to either, but makes himself an asylum, to which he retires in
case of necessity; where he shelters himself from dan∣ger, and brings
up his young.</P>
<P>As among men, those who lead a domestic life are more
civilized and more endued with wisdom than those who wander from place to
place, so, in the inferior ranks of animated na∣ture, the taking
possession of an home supposes a degree of instinct which others
are without<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Ibid.</BIBL></NOTE>. The
choice of the situation for this domicil, the art of making it convenient, of
hiding its entrance, and securing it against more powerful 
<PB N="326" REF="378"/> animals, are all so many marks of superior skill
and industry. The fox is furnished with both, and turns them to his
advantage. He generally keeps his kennel at the edge of the wood, and yet
within an easy journey of some neighbouring cottage. From thence he
listens to the crowing of the cock, and the cackling of the domestic fowls.
He scents them at a distance; he seizes his opportunity, conceals his
approaches, creeps slyly along, makes the attack, and seldom re∣turns
without his booty. If he be able to get into the yard, he begins by levelling
all the poultry without remorse, and carrying off a part of the spoil,
hides it at some convenient distance, and again returns to the charge.
Taking off another fowl in the same manner, he hides that also, but not in
the same place; and this he practises for several times together, until
the approach of day, or the noise of the domestics, give him warning to
retire. The same arts are practised when he finds birds en∣tangled in
springes laid for them by the fowler; the fox takes care to be beforehand,
very ex∣pertly takes the bird out of the snare, hides it for three or four
days, and knows very ex∣actly when and where to return to avail himself of
hidden treasure. He is equally alert in seiz∣ing the young hares and
rabbits, before they <PB N="327" REF="379"/> have strength enough to escape
him, and when the old ones are wounded and fatigued he is sure to come upon
them in their moments of distress, and to shew them no mercy. In the
same manner he finds out birds nests, seizes the partridge and the quail
while sitting, and de∣stroys a large quantity of game. The wolf is most
hurtful to the peasant, but the fox to the gentleman. In short, nothing
that can be eaten seems to come amiss; rats, mice, serpents, toads, and
lizards. He will, when urged by hunger, eat carrots and insects; and those
that live near the sea-coasts will, for want of other food, eat crabs,
shrimps, and shell fish. The hedge-hog in vain rolls itself up into a
ball to oppose him, this determined glutton teizes it until it is obliged to
appear uncovered, and then he devours it. The wasp and the wild bee are
attacked with equal success. Although at first they fly out upon their
invader, and ac∣tually oblige him to retire, this is but for a few minutes,
until he has rolled himself upon the ground, and thus crushed such as
stick to his skin; he then returns to the charge, and at last, by
perseverance, obliges them to abandon their combs; which he greedily devours,
both wax and honey.</P>
<P>The chace of the fox requires less preparation 
<PB N="328" REF="380"/> than that of the wolf, and it is also more plea∣sant
and amusing. As dogs have a natural re∣pugnance to pursue the wolf, so
they are equally alert in following the fox; which chace they prefer even to
that of the hare or the buck. The huntsmen, as upon other occasions, have
their cant terms for every part of this chace. The fox the first year is
called <HI>a cub</HI>; the second, <HI>a fox</HI>; and the third, an <HI>old
fox</HI>; his tail is called the <HI>brush</HI> or <HI>drag,</HI> and his
excrement the <HI>billiting.</HI> He is usually pursued by a large kind of
harrier or hound, assisted by tarriers, or a smaller breed, that follow
him into his kennel, and at∣tack him there. The instant he perceives
him∣self pursued, he makes to his kennel, and takes refuge at the bottom of
it, where for a while he loses the cry of his enemies; but the whole pack
coming to the mouth, redouble their ve∣hemence and rage, and the little tarrier
boldly ventures in. It often happens that the kennel is made under a rock, or
among the roots of old trees; and in such cases the fox cannot be dug out,
nor is the tarrier able to contend with him at the bottom of his hole. By this
con∣trivance he continues secure; but when he can be dug out, the usual way
is to carry him in a bag to some open country, and there set him loose
before the hounds. The hounds and the <PB N="329" REF="381"/> men follow,
barking and shouting wherever he runs; and the body being strongly
employed, the mind has not time to make any re∣flection on the futility of the
pursuit. What adds to this entertainment is the strong scent which the
fox leaves, that always keeps up a full cry; although as his scent is
stronger than that of the hare, it is much sooner evaporated. His shifts
to escape when all retreat is cut off to his kennel are various and
surprizing. He always chuses the most woody country, and takes those
paths that are most embarrassed with thorns and briars. He does not
double, nor use the unavailing shifts of the hare; but flies in a direct
line before the hounds, though at no very great distance; manages his
strength; takes to the low and plashy grounds, where the scent will be
less apt to lie; and at last, when overtaken, he defends himself with
desperate obstinacy, and fights in silence to the very last gasp.</P>
<P>The fox, though resembling the dog in many respects, is
nevertheless very distinct in his na∣ture, refusing to engender with it;
and though not testifying the antipathy of the wolf, yet discovering
nothing more than indifference. This animal also brings forth fewer at a time
than the dog, and that but once a year. Its <PB N="330" REF="382"/> litter is
generally from four to six, and seldom less than three. The female goes
with young about six weeks, and seldom stirs out while pregnant, but
makes a bed for her young, and takes every precaution to prepare for their
pro∣duction. When she finds the place of their retreat discovered, and that
her young have been disturbed during her absence, she removes them one
after the other in her mouth, and en∣deavours to find them out a place of
better se∣curity. A remarkable instance of this animal's parental affection
happened while I was writing this history, in the county of Essex. A
she-fox that had, as it should seem, but one cub, was unkennelled by a
gentleman's hounds, near Chelmsford, and hotly pursued. In such a case,
when her own life was in imminent peril, one would think it was not a time to
consult the safety of her young; however, the poor animal, braving every
danger, rather than leave her cub behind to be worried by the dogs, took it up
in her mouth, and ran with it in this manner for some miles. At last,
taking her way through a farmer's yard, she was assaulted by a mastiff,
and at last obliged to drop her cub, which was taken up by the farmer. I was
not displeased to hear that this faithful creature escaped the pursuit,
and at last got off in safety. <PB N="331" REF="383"/> The cubs of the fox
are born blind, like those of the dog; they are eighteen months or two years
in coming to perfection, and live about twelve or fourteen years.</P>
<P>As the fox makes war upon all animals, so all others seem to
make war upon him. The dog hunts him with peculiar acrimony; the wolf is
still a greater and more necessitous enemy, who pursues him to his very
retreat. Some pretend to say that, to keep the wolf away, the fox lays at the
mouth of its kennel a certain herb, to which the wolf has a parti∣cular
aversion. This, which no doubt is a fable, at least shews that these
two animals are as much enemies to each other as to all the rest of animated
nature. But the fox is not hunted by quadrupedes alone; for the birds, who know
him for their mortal enemy, attend him in his excursions, and give each other
warning of their approaching danger. The daw, the magpye, and the black bird
conduct him along, perching on the hedges as he creeps below, and, with their
cries and notes of hostility, apprize all other animals to beware; a caution
which they per∣fectly understand, and put into practice. The hunters
themselves are often informed by the birds of the place of his retreat, and
set the dogs into those thickets where they see them par∣ticularly 
<PB N="332" REF="384"/> noisy and querulous. So that it is the fate of this
petty plunderer to be detested by every rank of animals; all the weaker
classes shun, and all the stronger pursue him.</P>
<P>The fox, of all wild animals, is most subject to the influence
of climate; and there are found as many varieties in this kind almost as in
any of the domestic animals<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon,
Renard.</BIBL></NOTE>. The generality of foxes, as is well known, are red; but
there are some, though not in England, of a greyish cast; and Mr. Buffon
asserts that the tip of the tail in all foxes is white; which, however, is
not so in those of this country. There are only three varieties of this
animal in Great Britain, and these are rather established upon a
difference of size than of colour or form. The grey-hound fox is the
largest, tallest, and boldest; and will attack a grown sheep. The
mastiff fox is less, but more strongly built. The cur fox is the least
and most common; he lurks about hedges and out-houses, and is the most
pernicious of the three to the peasant and farmer.</P>
<P>In the colder countries round the pole, the foxes are of all
colours; black, blue, grey, iron grey, silver grey, white, white with red
legs, white with black heads, white with the tip of the tail black, red with
the throat and <PB REF="385"/>

more universally diffused than any of the former, being found in Europe, in
the temperate climates of Asia, and also in Ame∣rica; they are very rare in
Africa, and in the countries lying under the torrid zone. Those travellers
who talk of having seen them at Ca∣licut, and other parts of Southern India,
have mistaken the jackall for the fox. The fur of the white fox is held in no
great estimation, be∣cause the hair falls off; the blue fox skins are
also bought up with great avidity, from their scarceness; but the black
fox skin is of all others the most esteemed, a single skin often
selling for forty or fifty crowns. The hair of these is so disposed,
that it is impossible to tell which way the grain lies; for if we hold the
skin by the head the hair hangs to the tail, and if we hold it by the tail it
hangs down equally smooth and even to the head. These are often made into
men's muffs, and are at once very beautiful and warm. In our temperate climate,
however, furs are of very little service, there being scarce any weather
so severe in England from which our ordinary cloaths may not very well
defend us.</P>

<PB N="334" REF="389"/>
<HEAD>THE JACKALL.</HEAD>
<P>THE Jackall is one of the commonest wild animals in the whole
east; and yet there is scarce any less known in Europe, or more
con∣fusedly described by natural historians. In ge∣neral, we are
assured that it resembles the fox in figure and disposition, but we
are still ig∣norant of those nice distinctions by which it is known to be
of a different species. It is said to be of the size of a middling dog,
resembling the fox in the hinder parts, particularly the tail; and the wolf
in the fore-parts, especially the nose. Its legs are shorter than those
of the fox, and its colour is of a bright yellow, or sorrel, as we express
it in horses. This is the reason it has been called in Latin the Golden
Wolf; a name, however, which is entirely unknown in the countries where they
are most common.</P>
<P>The species of the jackall is diffused all over Asia, and is
found also in most parts of Africa, seeming to take up the place of the
wolf, which in those countries is not so common. There seems to be many
varieties among them; those of the warmest climates appear to be the
largest, and their colour is rather of a reddish brown than of that
beautiful yellow by which the smaller jackall are chiefly
distinguished.</P>
<P><PB N="335" REF="390"/>Although the species of the wolf
approaches very near to that of the dog, yet the jackall seems to be placed
between them; to the savage fierceness of the wolf it adds the impudent
fa∣miliarity of the dog<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon vol. xxvii. p.
52.</BIBL></NOTE>. Its cry is an howl, mixed with barking, and a lamentation
resembling that of human distress. It is more noisy in its pur∣suits
even than the dog, and more voracious than the wolf. The jackall never goes
alone, but always in a pack of forty or fifty together. These unite regularly
every day to form a com∣bination against the rest of the forest. Nothing
then can escape them; they are content to take up with the smallest
animals; and yet, when thus united, have they courage to face the largest.
They seem very little afraid of mankind; but pursue their game to their
very doors, without testify∣ing either attachment or apprehension. They
enter insolently into the sheep-folds, the yards, and the stables, and,
when they can find nothing else, devour the leather harness, boots, and
shoes, and run off with what they have not time to swallow.</P>
<P>They not only attack the living but the dead. They scratch up
with their feet the new made graves, and devour the corpse how putrid
soever. <PB N="336" REF="391"/> In those countries therefore where they
abound, they are obliged to beat the earth over the grave, and to mix it with
thorns, to prevent the jackalls from scraping it away. They always
assist each other as well in this employment of exhumation as in that of
the chace. While they are at this dreary work, they exhort each other by a
most mournful cry, resembling that of children under chastisement; and
when they have thus dug up the body, they share it ami∣cably between them.
These, like all other sa∣vage animals, when they have once tasted of
human flesh, can never after refrain from pur∣suing mankind. They watch the
burying grounds, follow armies, and keep in the rear of caravans. They may be
considered as the vulture of the quadrupede kind; every thing that once had
animal life, seems equally agree∣able to them; the most putrid
substances are greedily devoured; dried leather, and any thing that has
been rubbed with grease, how insipid soever in itself, is sufficient
to make the whole go down.</P>
<P>They hide themselves in holes by day, and seldom appear abroad
till night-fall, when the jackall that has first hit upon the scent of
some larger beast gives notice to the rest by an howl, 
<PB N="337" REF="392"/> which it repeats as it runs; while all the rest, that
are within hearing, pack in to its assist∣ance. The gazelle, or whatever
other beast it may be, finding itself pursued, makes off towards the
houses and the towns; hoping, by that means, to deter its pursuers from
follow∣ing: but hunger gives the jackall the same de∣gree of boldness that
scar gives the gazelle, and it pursues even to the verge of the city, and
often along the streets. The gazelle, however, by this means, most
frequently escapes; for the inhabitants sallying our, often disturb the
jack∣all in the chace; and as it hunts by the scent, when once driven off, it
never recovers it again. In this manner we see how experience prompts the
gazelle, which is naturally a very timid animal, and particularly fearful of
man himself, to take refuge near him, considering him as the least
dangerous enemy, and often escaping by his assistance.</P>
<P>But man is not the only intruder upon the jackall's industry and
pursuits. The lion, the tiger, and the panther, whose appetites are
su∣perior to their swiftness, attend to its call, and follow in silence
at some distance behind<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Linnaei Systema, p.
60.</BIBL></NOTE>. The jackall pursues the whole night with un∣ceasing
assiduity, keeping up the cry, and with <PB N="338" REF="393"/> great
perseverance at last tires down its prey; but just at the moment it
supposes itself going to share the fruits of its labour, the lion or
the leopard comes in, satiates himself upon the spoil, and his poor
provider must be content with the bare carcass he leaves behind. It is not
to be wondered at, therefore, if the jackall be voracious, since it so
seldom has a suffi∣ciency; nor that it feeds on putrid substances,
since it is not permitted to feast on what it has newly killed. Beside
these enemies, the jackall has still another to cope with, for between him
and the dog there is an irreconcileable anti∣pathy, and they never part without
an engage∣ment. The Indian peasants often chace them as we do foxes; and have
learned, by expe∣rience, when they have got a lion or a tiger in their rear.
Upon such occasions they keep their dogs close, as they would be no match
for such formidable animals, and endeavour to put them to flight with their
cries. When the lion is dismissed, they more easily cope with the
jackall, who is as stupid as it is impudent, and seems much better fitted
for pursuing than re∣treating. It sometimes happens that one of them
steals silently into an outhouse, to seize the poultry, or devour the
furniture, but hear∣ing others in full cry without at a distance, 
<PB N="339" REF="394"/> without thought, it instantly answers the call, and
thus betrays its own depredations. The peasants sally out upon it, and the
foolish ani∣mal finds, too late, that its instinct was too powerful for its
safety.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>THE ISATIS.</HEAD>
<P>AS the jackall is a sort of intermediate spe∣cies between the
dog and the wolf<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In this description I have followed
Mr. Buffon.</NOTE>, so the isatis may be considered as placed between the
dog and the fox. This animal has hitherto been supposed to be only a
variety of the latter; but from the latest observations, there is no doubt
of their being perfectly distinct. The isatis is very common in all the
northern countries bor∣dering upon the Icy sea; and is seldom found, except
in the coldest countries. It extremely resembles a fox, in the form of its
body, and the length of its tail; and a dog, in the make of its head, and the
position of its eyes. The hair of these animals is softer than that of a
common fox; some are blue, some are white at one season, and at another
of a russet brown. Although the whole of its hair be two inches long,
thick, tufted and glossy, yet the under <PB N="340" REF="395"/> jaw is
entirely without any, and the skin appears bare in that part.</P>
<P>This animal can bear only the coldest climates, and is chiefly
seen along the coasts of the Icy sea, and upon the banks of the great
rivers that discharge themselves therein. It is chiefly fond of living in
the open country, and seldom seen in the forest, being mostly found in
the moun∣tainous and naked regions of Norway, Siberia, and Lapland. It burrows,
like the fox; and when with young, the female retires to her kennel, in the
same manner as the fox is seen to do. These holes, which are very narrow,
and extremely deep, have many out-lets. They are kept very clean, and are
bedded at the bottom with moss, for the animal to be more at its ease. Its
manner of coupling, time of gestation, and number of young, are all similar
to what is found in the fox; and it usually brings forth at the end of May,
or the beginning of June.</P>
<P>Such are the particulars in which this animal differs from those
of the dog kind, and in which it resembles them: but its most striking
peculiarity remains still to be mentioned; namely, its changing its colour,
and being seen at one time brown, and at another perfectly white. As was
already said, some are natu∣rally blue, and their colour never changes; but
<PB N="341" REF="396"/> such as are to be white, are, when brought forth, of a
yellow hue, which, in the beginning of September, is changed to white, all
except along the top of the back, along which runs a stripe of brown, and
another crossing it down the shoulders, at which time the animal is
called the <HI>crost fox</HI>; however, this brown cross totally
disappears before winter, and then the creature is all over white, and its
fur is two inches long: this, about the beginning of May, again begins to fall;
and the molting is completed about the middle of July, when the isatis
becomes brown once more. The fur of this animal is of no value, unless it be
killed in winter.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>THE HYAENA.</HEAD>
<P>THE hyaena is the last animal I shall men∣tion among those
of the dog kind, which it in many respects resembles, although too
strongly marked to be strictly reduced to any type. The hyaena is nearly of
the size of a wolf; and has some similitude to that animal in the shape
of its head and body. The head, at first sight, does not appear to differ,
except that the ears of the hyaena are longer, and more without hair; but, upon
observing more closely, we shall find the head broader, the nose
slatter, and <PB N="342" REF="397"/> not so pointed. The eyes are not placed
ob∣liquely, but more like those of a dog. The legs, particularly the hinder,
are longer than those either of the dog or the wolf, and differ∣ent from all
other quadrupedes whatsoever, in having but four toes, as well on the fore
feet as on the hinder. Its hair is of a dirty greyish, marked with black,
disposed in waves down its body. Its tail is short, with pretty long
hair; and immediately under it, above the anus, there is an opening into a kind
of glandular pouch, which separates a substance of the con∣sistence,
but not of the odour, of civet. This opening might have given rise to the
error of the ancients, who asserted, that this animal was every year,
alternately, male and female. Such are the most striking distinctions of
the hyaena, as given us by naturalists; which, ne∣vertheless, convey but a
very confused idea of the peculiarity of its form. Its manner of hold∣ing the
head seems remarkable; somewhat like a dog, pursuing the scent, with
the nose near the ground. The head being held thus low, the back appears
elevated, like that of the hog, which, with a long bristly band of hair that
runs all along, gives it a good deal the air of that animal; and, it is
probable that, from this similitude it first took its name, the word
<HI>huoina</HI> <PB N="343" REF="398"/> being Greek, and derived from
<HI>hus,</HI> which sig∣nifies a sow.</P>
<P>But no words can give an adequate idea of this animal's figure,
deformity, and fierceness, more savage and untameable than any other
quadrupede, it seems to be for ever in a state of rage or rapacity, for
ever growling, except when receiving its food. Its eyes then glisten, the
bristles of its back all stand upright, its head hangs low, and yet its
teeth appear; all which give it a most frightful aspect, which a dreadful
howl tends to heighten. This, which I have often heard, is very peculiar: its
be∣ginning resembles the voice of a man moan∣ing, and its latter part as if
he were making a violent effort to vomit. As it is loud and fre∣quent, it
might, perhaps, have been sometimes mistaken for that of a human voice in
distress, and have given rise to the accounts of the ancients, who tell
us, that the hyaena makes its moan, to attract unwary travellers, and then to
destroy them: however this be, it seems the most un∣tractable, and, for
its size, the most terrible of all other quadrupedes; nor does its courage
fall short of its ferocity; it defends itself against the lion, is a
match for the panther, and attacks the ounce, that it seldom fails to
conquer.</P>
<P>It is an obscene and solitary animal, to be 
<PB N="344" REF="399"/> found chiefly in the most desolate and unculti∣vated
parts of the torrid zone, of which it is a native<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon.</BIBL></NOTE>. It resides in the caverns of
mountains, in the clefts of rocks, or in dens that it has formed for itself
under the earth. Though taken never so young, it cannot be tamed; it lives by
depredation, like the wolf, but is much stronger, and more courageous. It
sometimes attacks man, carries off cattle, follows the flock, breaks open the
sheep cots by night, and ravages with insatiable voracity. Its eyes shine
by night; and it is asserted, not without great appearance of truth, that
it sees better by night than by day. When destitute of other provision,
it scrapes up the graves, and devours the dead bodies, how putrid so ever.
To these dispo∣sitions, which are sufficiently noxious and for∣midable,
the ancients have added numberless others, which are long since known to be
fables; as, for instance, that the hyaena was male and female alternately;
that having brought forth and suckled its young, it then changed sexes for
a year, and became a male. This, as was mentioned above, could only proceed
from the opening under the tail, which all animals of this species are found
to have; and which is found in the same manner in no other quadrupede,

the badger. There is, in the weasel kind indeed, an opening, but it is lower
down, and not placed above the anus, as in the badger and the hyaena. Some have
said that this ani∣mal changed the colour of its hair at will; others, that a
stone was found in its eye, which, put under a man's tongue, gave him the
gift of prophecy; some have said that he had no joints in the neck, which,
however, all quadrupedes are known to have; and some, that the shadow of
the hyaena kept dogs from barking. These, among many other absurdi∣ties,
have been asserted of this quadrupede; and which I mention to shew the
natural dis∣position of mankind, to load those that are al∣ready but too
guilty, with accumulated re∣proach.</P>

<PB N="346" REF="404"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. IX. Of Animals of the Weasel Kind.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING described the bolder ranks of carnivorous animals, we now
come to a minuter and more feeble class, less formidable indeed than any of
the former, but far more nu∣merous, and, in proportion to their size, more
active and enterprizing. The weasel kind may be particularly
distinguished from other car∣nivorous animals, by the length and
slenderness of their bodies, which are so fitted as to wind, like worms,
into very small openings, after their prey; and hence also they have
received the name of vermin, from their similitude to the worm in this
particular. These animals differ from all of the cat kind, in the formation
and disposition of their claws, which, as in the dog kinds, they can
neither draw in nor extend at pleasure, as cats are known to do. They differ
from the dog kind, in being cloathed rather with fur than hair; and although
some varieties of the fox may resemble them in this particular, yet the
coat of the latter is longer, stronger, and always more resembling hair.
Beside these distinctions, all animals of the <PB N="347" REF="405"/>
weasel kind have glands placed near the anus, that either open into it, or
beneath it, furnish∣ing a substance that, in some, has the most
offensive smell in nature, in others, the most pleasing perfume. All of
this kind are still more marked by their habitudes and dispo∣sitions,
than their external form; cruel, vora∣cious, and cowardly, they subsist
only by theft, and find their chief protection in their minute∣ness. They are
all, from the shortness of their legs, slow in pursuit; and, therefore,
owe their support to their patience, assiduity, and cun∣ning. As their
prey is precarious, they live a long time without food; and if they happen to
fall in where it is in plenty, they instantly destroy all about them before
they begin to satisfy their appetite, and suck the blood of every animal
before they begin to touch its flesh.</P>
<P>These are the marks common to this kind, all the species of
which have a most striking resemblance to each other; and he that has
seen one, in some measure, may be said to have seen all. The chief
distinction in this nu∣merous class of animals, is to be taken from the
size; for no words can give the minute ir∣regularities of that outline by
which one species is to be distinguished from that which is next 
<PB N="348" REF="406"/> it. I will begin, therefore, with the least and the
best known of this kind, and still marking the size, will proceed
gradually to larger and larger, until we come from the weasel to the glutton,
which I take to be the largest of all. The weasel will serve as a model
for all the rest; and, indeed, the points in which they differ from this
little animal, are but very in∣considerable.</P>
<P>The Weasel<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>British Zoology, vol.
i. p. 83.</BIBL></NOTE>, as was said, is the smallest of this numerous
tribe; its length not exceeding seven inches, from the tip of the nose to
the insertion of the tail. This length, however, seems to be very great, if
we compare it with the height of the animal, which is not above an inch and an
half. In measuring the wolf, we find him to be not above once and an half as
long as he is high; in observing the weasel, we find it near five times as
long as it is high, which shews an amazing disproportion. The tail also,
which is bushy, is two inches and an half long, and adds to the apparent
length of this little animal's body. The colour of the weasel is of a bright
red on the back and sides, but white under the throat and the belly. It has
whiskers like a cat; and thirty two teeth, which is two more than any of the
cat kind; and these <PB N="349" REF="407"/> also seem better adapted for
tearing and chew∣ing, than those of the cat kind are. The eyes are little and
black. The ears short, broad, and roundish; and have a fold at the lower
part, which makes them look as if they were double. Beneath the corners of the
mouth, on each jaw, is a spot of brown.</P>
<P>This animal, though very diminutive to appearance, is,
nevertheless, a very formidable enemy to quadrupedes an hundred times its own
size. It is very common and well known in most parts of this country; but
seems held in very different estimation, in different parts of it. In
those places where sheep or lambs are bred, the weasel is a most
noxious inmate, and every art is used to destroy it; on the con∣trary, in
places where agriculture is chiefly fol∣lowed, the weasel is considered as
a friend that thins the number of such vermin as chiefly live upon corn:
however, in all places, it is one of the most untameable and untractable
animals in the world<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon, vol. xv. p.
37.</BIBL></NOTE>. When kept in a cage, either for the purposes of
amusement or inspection, it will not touch any part of its victuals while
any body looks on. It keeps in a continual agitation, and seems frighted so
much at the sight of mankind, that it will die, if not permitted to hide
itself from <PB N="350" REF="408"/> their presence. For this purpose, it
must be provided, in its cage, with a sufficient quantity of wool or hay,
in which it may conceal itself, and where it may carry whatever it has got to
eat; which, however, it will not touch until it begins to putrefy. In this
state it is seen to pass three parts of the day in sleeping; and
re∣serves the night for its times of exercise and eating.</P>
<P>In its wild state, the night is likewise the time during which
it may be properly said to live. At the approach of evening, it is seen
stealing from its hole, and creeping about the farmer's yard for its prey. If
it enters the place where poultry are kept, it never attacks the cocks or the
old hens, but immediately aims at the young ones. It does not eat its prey on
the place, but, after killing it by a single bite near the head, and with a
wound so small that the place can scarcely be perceived, it carries it
off to its young, or its retreat. It also breaks and sucks the eggs, and
sometimes kills the hen that attempts to defend them. It is remark∣ably
active; and, in a confined place, scarce any animal can escape it. It will
run up the sides of walls with such facility, that no place is se∣cure
from it; and its body is so small, that there is scarce any hole but what
it can wind <PB N="351" REF="409"/> through. During the summer, its
excursions are more extensive; but in winter, it chiefly confines itself
in barns and farm-yards, where it remains till spring, and where it brings
forth its young. All this season it makes war upon the rats and mice, with
still greater success than the cat; for being more active and slender,
it pursues them into their holes, and, after a short resistance,
destroys them. It creeps also into pidgeon-holes, destroys the young,
catches sparrows, and all kind of small birds; and, if it has brought forth
its young, hunts with still greater boldness and avidity. In summer, it
ventures farther from the house; and par∣ticularly goes into those places
where the rat, its chiefest prey, goes before it. Accordingly, it is found in
the lower grounds, by the side of waters, near mills, and often is seen to
hide its young in the hollow of a tree.</P>
<P>The female takes every precaution to make an easy bed for her
little ones: she lines the bottom of her hole with grass, hay, leaves, and
moss, and generally brings forth from three to five at a time. All animals of
this, as well as those of the dog kind, bring forth their young with closed
eyes; but they very soon acquire strength sufficient to follow the dam in
her ex∣cursions, and assist in her projects of petty 
<PB N="352" REF="410"/> rapine. The weasel, like all others of its kind, does
not run on equably, but moves by bound∣ing; and when it climbs a tree, by a
single spring it gets a good way from the ground. It jumps in the same
manner upon its prey; and, having an extremely limber body, evades the attempts
of much stronger animals to seize it.</P>
<P>This animal, like all of its kind, has a very strong smell; and
that of the weasel is peculiarly foetid. This scent is very
distinguishable in those creatures, when they void their excre∣ment; for
the glands which furnish this foetid substance, which is of the
consistence of suet, open directly into the orifice of the anus, and
taint the excrement with the strong effluvia. The weasel smells more
strongly in summer than in winter; and more abominably when ir∣ritated or
pursued, than when at its ease. It always preys in silence, and never has
a cry ex∣cept when struck, and then it has a rough kind of squeaking, which
at once expresses resent∣ment and pain. Its appetite for animal food
never forsakes it; and it seems even to take a pleasure in the vicinity
of putrefaction. Mr. Buffon tells us of one of them being found, with three
young ones, in the carcass of a wolf that was grown putrid, and that had been
hung up, by the hind legs, as a terror to others. <PB N="353" REF="411"/> Into
this horrid retreat the weasel thought proper to retire to bring forth her
young; she had furnished the cavity with hay, grass, and leaves; and the
young were just brought forth when they were discovered by a peasant
passing that way.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>THE ERMINE, OR STOAT,</HEAD>
<P>NEXT to the weasel in size, and perfectly alike in figure, is
the Ermine. The difference between this and the former animal is so very
small, that many, and among the rest Linnaeus, who gives but one
description of both, have confounded the two kinds together. However their
differences are sufficient to induce later naturalists to suppose the
two kinds distinct; and as their lights seems preferable, we chuse to
follow their descriptions<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon, British
Zoology.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P>The stoat, or ermine, differs from the weasel in size, being
usually nine inches long; whereas the former is not much above six. The
tail of the ermine is always tipped with black, and is longer in proportion to
the body and more fur∣nished with hair. The edges of the ears and the ends of
the toes in this animal are of a yellowish white; and although it is of the
same colour with the weasel, being of a lightish <PB N="354" REF="412"/>
brown, and though both this animal, as well as the weasel, in the most
northern parts of Europe, changes its colour in winter, and be∣comes white; yet
even then the weasel may be easily distinguished from the ermine by the
tip of the tail, which in the latter is always black.</P>
<P>It is well known that the fur of the ermine is the most valuable
of any hitherto known; and it is in winter only that this little animal has it
of the proper colour and consistence. In summer, the ermine, as was
said before, is brown, and it may at that time more properly be called the
stoat. There are few so unac∣quainted with quadrupedes as not to perceive
this change of colour in the hair, which in some degree obtains in them all.
The horse, the cow, and the goat, all manifestly change colour in the
beginning of summer, the old long hair falling off, and a shorter coat of
hair appearing in its room, generally of a darker colour, and yet more
glossy. What obtains in our temperate climate, is seen to prevail still
more strongly in those regions where the winters are long and severe, and
the summers short and yet generally hot in an extreme degree. The animal
has strength enough during that season, to throw off a warm coat of fur,
which would but incommode it, and continues for two or <PB N="355" REF="413"/>
three months in a state somewhat resembling the ordinary quadrupedes of
the milder cli∣mates. At the approach of winter, however, the cold
encreasing, the coat of hair seems to thicken in proportion; from being
coarse and short it lengthens and grows finer, while mul∣titudes of
smaller hairs grow up between the longer, thicken the coat, and give it all
that warmth and softness which are so much valued in the furs of the
northern animals.</P>
<P>It is no easy matter to account for this re∣markable warmth of
the furs of northern qua∣drupedes, or how they come to be furnished with
such an abundant covering. It is easy enough, indeed, to say that Nature
fits them thus for the climate; and, like an indulgent mother, when she
exposes them to the rigour of an intem∣perate winter, supplies them with a
covering against its inclemency. But this is only flou∣rishing; it is not
easy, I say, to tell how Nature comes to furnish them in this manner. A
few particulars on this subject are all that we yet know. It is observable
among quadrupedes, as well as even among the human species itself, that a
thin sparing diet is apt to produce hair; children that have been ill fed,
famished dogs and horses, are more hairy than others whose food has been
more plentiful. This may, therefore, be one <PB N="356" REF="414"/> cause that
the animals of the north, in winter, are more hairy than those of the milder
climates. At that season, the whole country is covered with deep snow,
and the provisions which these creatures are able to procure can be but
pre∣carious and scanty. Its becoming finer may also proceed from the
severity of the cold, that contracts the pores of the skin, and the hair
consequently takes the shape of the aperture through which it grows, as
wiers are made smaller by being drawn through a smaller ori∣fice. However
this may be, all the animals of the artic climates may be said to have their
winter and summer garments, except very far to the north, as in Greenland,
where the cold is so continually intense and the food so scarce, that
neither the bears nor foxes change colour at all<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Krantz's History of Greenland, vol. i. p.
72.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P>The ermine, as was said, is remarkable among these for the
softness, the closeness, and the warmth of its fur. It is brown in
summer, like the weasel, and changes colour before the winter is begun,
becoming a beautiful cream colour, all except the tip of the tail, as was
said before, which still continues black. Mr. Daubenton had one of these
brought him with its white winter <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ur, which he put into a cage and kept, <PB N="357" REF="415"/> in
order to observe the manner of moulting its hair. He received it in the
beginning of March, and in a very short time it began to shed its coat, and
a mixture of brown was seen to prevail among the white, so that at the
ninth of the same month its head was nearly become of a reddish brown. Day
after day this colour appeared to extend at first along the neck and down the
back, in the manner of a stripe of about half an inch broad. The fore-part of
the legs then assumed the same colour; a part of the head, the thighs,
and the tail, were the last that changed; but at the end of the month there
was no white remaining, except on those parts which are always white in this
species, particu∣larly the throat and the belly. However, he had not the
pleasure of seeing this animal re∣sume its former whiteness, although
he kept it for above two years; which, without doubt, was owing to its
imprisoned state; this colour being partly owing to its stinted food, and
partly to the rigour of the season. During its state of confinement, this
little animal always continued very wild and untractable; for ever in a state
of violent agitation, except when asleep, which it often continued for three
parts of the day. Except for its most disagreeable scent, it was an
extremely pretty creature, its <PB N="358" REF="416"/> eyes sprightly, its
physiognomy pleasant, and its motions so swift that the eye could
scarce at∣tend them. It was fed with eggs and flesh, but it always let them
putrify before it touched either. As some of this kind are known to be fond
of honey, it was tried to feed this animal with such food for a while; after
having for three or four days deprived it of other food, it ate of this, and
died shortly after; a strong proof of its being a distinct species from
the pole cat or the martin, who feed upon honey, but otherwise pretty much
resemble the ermine in their figure and dispositions.</P>
<P>In the north of Europe and Siberia, their skins make a valuable
article of commerce, and they are found there much more frequently than among
us. In Siberia they burrow in the fields, and are taken in traps baited with
flesh. In Norway they are either shot with blunt ar∣rows or taken in traps
made of two flat stones, one being propped with a stick, to which is
fastened a baited string, which when the ani∣mals attempt to pull away, the
stone drops and crushes them to death. This animal is some∣times found
white in Great Britain, and is then called a white weasel. Its furs, however,
among us are of no value, having neither the thickness, the closeness,
nor the whiteness of those which <PB N="359" REF="417"/> come from Siberia.
The fur of the ermine, in every country, changes by time; for, as much of its
beautiful whiteness is given it by certain arts known to the furriers, so
its natural colour returns, and its former whiteness can never be restored
again.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>THE FERRET.</HEAD>
<P>THE animal next in size to the ermine, is the ferret; which is a
kind of domestic in Europe, though said to be originally brought from
Africa into Spain, which being a country abounding in rabbits, required an
animal of this kind, more than any other: however this be, it is not to be
found at present among us except in its domestic state; and it is chiefly
kept tame, for the purposes of the warren.</P>
<P>The ferret is about one foot long, being nearly four inches longer
than the weasel. It resembles that animal in the slenderness of its
body, and the shortness of its legs; but its nose is sharper, and its
body more slender, in pro∣portion to its length. The ferret is commonly of a
cream colour; but they are also found of all the colours of the weasel
kind; white, black∣ish, brown, and party-coloured. Those that are of the
whitish kind, have their eyes red, as is almost general with all animals
entirely of that <PB N="360" REF="418"/> colour. But its principal distinction
from the weasel, is the length of the hair on its tail, which is much longer
in the ferret than the weasel. Words will not well express the other
distinctions; and what might take up a page in dull discrimination, a
single glance of the eye, when the animals themselves are pre∣sented, can
discover.</P>
<P>As this animal is a native of the torrid zone<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon.</BIBL></NOTE>, so it cannot bear the rigours of
our climate, without care and shelter; and it gene∣rally repays the trouble
of its keeping, by its great agility in the warren. It is naturally such an
enemy of the rabbit kind, that if a dead rabbit be presented to a young
ferret, although it has never seen one before, it instantly attacks and
bites it with an appearance of rapacity. If the rabbit be living, the ferret is
still more eager, seizes it by the neck, winds itself round it, and
continues to suck its blood, till it be satiated.</P>
<P>Their chief use in warrens, is to enter the holes, and drive the
rabbits into the nets that are prepared for them at the mouth. For this
purpose, the ferret is muzzled; otherwise, in∣stead of driving out the
rabbit, it would con∣tent itself with killing and sucking its blood at 
<PB N="361" REF="419"/> the bottom of the hole; but, by this con∣trivance, being
rendered unable to seize its prey, the rabbit escapes from its claws, and
instantly makes to the mouth of the hole with such precipitation, that it
is inextricably en∣tangled in the net placed there for its reception. It often
happens, however, that the ferret dis∣engages itself of its muzzle, and
then it is most commonly lost, unless it be dug out; for, find∣ing all
its wants satisfied in the warren, it never thinks of returning to the owner,
but continues to lead a rapacious solitary life while the summer continues,
and dies with the cold of the winter. In order to bring the ferret from his
hole, the owners often burn straw and other substances at the mouth; they
also beat above, to terrify it; but this does not always succeed; for as
there are often several issues to each hole, the ferret is affected
neither by the noise or the smoke, but continues secure at the bottom,
sleeping the greatest part of the time, and waking only to satisfy the
calls of hunger.</P>
<P>The female of this species<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon.</BIBL></NOTE>, is sensibly less than the male,
whom she seeks with great ar∣dour, and, it is said, often dies, without
being admitted. They are usually kept in boxes, <PB N="362" REF="420"/> with
wool, of which they make themselves a warm bed, which serves to defend them
from the rigour of the climate. They sleep almost continually; and the
instant they awake, they seem eager for food. They are usually fed with
bread and milk, and they breed twice a year. Some of them devour their young as
soon as brought forth; and then they become fit for the male again. Their
number is usually from five to six at a litter; and this is said to
consist of more females than males. Upon the whole, this is an useful,
but a disagreeable and offensive animal; its scent is foetid, its nature
voracious, it is tame without any attachment, and such is its appetite for
blood, that it has been known to attack and kill children in the cradle. It is
very easy to be irritated; and, although at all times its smell is very
offensive, it then is much more so; and its bite is very difficult of
cure.</P>
<P>To the ferret kind we may add an animal which Mr. Buffon calls the
Vansire, the skin of which was sent him stuffed, from Madagascar. It
was thirteen inches long, a good deal re∣sembling the ferret in figure, but
differing in the number of its grinding teeth, which amounted to twelve;
whereas, in the ferret, there are but eight: it differed also in colour, 
<PB N="363" REF="421"/> being of a dark brown, and exactly the same on all
parts of its body. Of this animal, so nearly resembling the ferret, we have
no other history but the mere description of its figure; and in a
quadrupede whose kind is so strongly marked, perhaps this is sufficient
to satisfy curiosity.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>THE POLECAT.</HEAD>
<P>THE Polecat is larger than the weasel, the ermine, or the
ferret, being one foot five inches long; whereas, the weasel is but six
inches, the ermine nine, and the ferret eleven inches. It so much resembles
the ferret in form, that some have been of opinion they were one and the
same animal; nevertheless, there are a sufficient number of
distinctions between them: it is, in the first place, larger than the
ferret; it is not quite so slender, and has a blunter nose; it differs
also internally, having but fourteen ribs, whereas the ferret has fifteen;
and wants one of the breast bones, which is found in the ferret: however,
warreners assert, that the pole∣cat will mix with the ferret; and they are
some∣times obliged to procure an intercourse between these two animals,
to improve the breed of the latter, which, by long confinement, is sometimes 
<PB N="364" REF="422"/> seen to abate of its rapacious disposition. Mr.
Buffon denies that the ferret will admit the pole∣cat; yet gives a variety,
under the name of both animals, which may very probably be a spurious race
between the two.</P>
<P>However this be, the polecat seems by much the more pleasing
animal of the two; for al∣though the long slender shape of all these
ver∣min tribes gives them a very disagreeable ap∣pearance, yet the
softness and colour of the hair in some of them, atones for the defect,
and renders them, if not pretty, at least not frightful. The polecat, for the
most part, is of a deep chocolate colour; it is white about the mouth; the
ears are short, rounded, and tipt with white; a little beyond the corners of
the mouth a stripe begins, which runs backward, partly white and partly
yellow: its hair, like that of all this class, is of two sorts; the long
and the furry: but, in this animal, the two kinds are of different colours; the
longest is black, and the shorter yellowish<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Ray's Synopsis.</BIBL></NOTE>: the throat, feet and tail,
are blacker than any other parts of the body: the claws are white underneath,
and brown above; and its tail is about two inches and an half.</P>
<P>It is very destructive to young game of all 
<PB N="365" REF="423"/> kinds<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>British Zoology,
vol. i. p. 78.</BIBL></NOTE>: but the rabbit seems to be its fa∣vourite prey;
a single polecat is often suf∣ficient to destroy a whole warren; for,
with that insatiable thirst for blood which is natural to all the weasel
kind, it kills much more than it can devour; and I have seen twenty rabbits
at a time taken out dead, which they had destroyed, and that by a wound which
was hardly perceptible. Their size, however, which is so much larger than
the weasel, renders their retreats near houses much more precarious;
although I have seen them burrow near a vil∣lage, so as scarcely to be
extirpated. But, in general, they reside in woods or thick brakes, making
holes under ground of about two yards deep, commonly ending among the roots of
large treets, for greater security. In winter they frequent houses, and
make a common practice of robbing the hen-roost and the dairy.</P>
<P>The polecat is particularly destructive among pidgeons<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon.</BIBL></NOTE>, when it gets into a
dove-house; without making so much noise as the weasel, it does a great
deal more mischief; it dis∣patches each with a single wound in the head;
and, after killing a great number, and satiating itself with their blood,
it then begins to think <PB N="366" REF="424"/> of carrying them home. This it
carefully performs, going and returning, and bringing them one by one to its
hole; but if it should happen that the opening by which it got into the
dove-house be not large enough for the body of the pidgeon to get through,
this mis∣chievous creature contents itself with carrying away the heads,
and makes a most delicious feast upon the brains.</P>
<P>It is not less fond of honey, attacking the hives in winter, and
forcing the bees away. It does not remove far from houses in winter, as its
prey is not so easily found in the woods dur∣ing that season. The
female brings forth her young in summer, to the number of five or six at a
time; these she soon trains to her own ra∣pacious habits, supplying the
want of milk, which no carnivorous quadrupede has in plenty, with the blood of
such animals as she happens to seize. The fur of this animal is
considered as soft and warm; yet it is in less estimation than some
of a much inferior kind, from its offensive smell, which can never be
wholly removed, or suppressed. The polecat seems to be an inhabitant of
the temperate climates<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon.</BIBL></NOTE>,
scarce any being found towards the north, and but very few in the warmer
la∣titudes. <PB REF="425"/>

species appears to be confined in Europe, from Poland to Italy. It is
certain, that these animals are afraid of the cold, as they are often seen
to come into houses in winter, and as their tracks are never found in the
snow, near their retreats. It is probable, also, that they are afraid of
heat, as they are but thinly scattered in the southern climates.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>THE MARTIN.</HEAD>
<P>THE Martin is a larger animal than any of the former, being
generally eighteen inches long, and the tail ten more. It differs from the
polecat, in being about four or five inches longer; its tail also is longer
in proportion, and more bushy at the end; its nose is flatter; its cry is
sharper and more piercing; its colours are more elegant; and, what still
adds to their beauty, its scent, very unlike the former, in∣stead of being
offensive, is considered as a most pleasing perfume. The martin, in
short, is the most beautiful of all British beasts of prey: its head is
small, and elegantly formed; its eyes lively; its ears are broad, rounded and
open; its back, its sides, and tail, are covered with a fine thick downy fur,
with longer hair inter∣mixed; the roots are ash colour, the middle of 
<PB N="368" REF="429"/> a bright chesnut, the points black; the head is brown,
with a slight cast of red; the legs, and upper sides of the feet, are of
a chocolate colour; the palms, or under sides, are covered with a thick down,
like that of the body; the feet are broad, the claws white, large and sharp,
well adapted for the purposes of climb∣ing, but, as in others of the weasel
kind, in∣capable of being sheathed or unsheathed at pleasure; the throat
and breast are white; the belly of the same colour with the back, but
rather paler; the hair on the tail is very long, especially at the end, where
it appears much thicker than near the insertion.</P>
<P>There is also a variety of this animal, called the yellow
breasted martin, which in no respect differs from the former, except that
this has a yellow breast, whereas the other has a white one: the colour of
the body also is darker; and, as it lives more among trees than the other
martin, its fur is more valuable, beautiful and glossy. The former of
these Mr. Buffon calls the Fouine; the latter, simply the Martin; and he
supposes them to be a distinct species: but as they differ only in
colour, it is unnecessary to embarrass history by a new distinction,
where there is only so minute a difference.</P>
<P>Of all animals of the weasel kind, the martin 
<PB N="369" REF="430"/> is the most pleasing; all its motions shew great
grace, as well as agility; and there is scarce an animal in our woods that
will venture to oppose it. Quadrupedes five times as big are easily
vanquished; the hare, the sheep, and even the wild cat itself, though
much stronger, is not a match for the martin: and although carnivorous
animals are not fond of engaging each other, yet the wild cat and the martin
seldom meet without a combat. Gesner tells us of one of this kind that he
kept tame, which was ex∣tremely playful and pretty; it went among the houses
of the neighbourhood, and always re∣turned home when hungry: it was extremely
fond of a dog that had been bred up with it, and used to play with it as cats
are seen to play, lying on its back, and biting without anger or injury. That
which was kept tame by Mr. Buffon, was not quite so social: it was
divested of its ferocity, but continued without attachment; and was still
so wild as to be obliged to be held by a chain. Whenever a cat appeared, it
prepared for war; and if any of the poultry came within its reach, it flew upon
them with avidity. Though it was tied by the middle of the body, it frequently
escaped: at first it returned after some hours, but without seeming
pleased, and as if it only <PB N="370" REF="431"/> came to be fed; the next
time it continued abroad longer; and, at last, went away without ever
returning. It was a female, and was, when it went off, a year and an half old;
and Mr. Buffon supposes it to have gone in quest of the male. It ate
every thing that was given it, except sallad or herbs; and it was remarkably
fond of honey. It was remarked that it drank often, and often slept for two
days together; and that, in like manner, it was often two or three days without
sleeping. Before it went to sleep, it drew itself up into a round, hid
its head, and covered it with its tail. When awake it was in continual
agitation, and was obliged to be tied up, not less to prevent its attacking
the poultry than to hinder it from breaking whatever it came near, by the
capri∣cious wildness of its motions.</P>
<P>The yellow breasted martin is much more common in France than in
England; and yet even there this variety is much scarcer than that with the
white breast. The latter keeps nearer houses and villages to make its petty
ravages among the sheep and the poultry; the other keeps in the woods, and
leads in every respect a savage life, building its nest on the tops of
trees, and living upon such animals as are en∣tirely wild like itself.
About night-fall it <PB N="371" REF="432"/> usually quits its solitude to
seek its prey, hunts after squirrels, rats, and rabbits; destroys great
numbers of birds and their young, takes the eggs from the nest, and often
removes them to its own without breaking<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Brooke's
Natural History.</BIBL></NOTE>. The instant the martin finds itself
pursued by dogs, for which purpose there is a peculiar breed, that seem
fit for this chace only, it immediately makes to its retreat, which is
generally in the hollow of some tree, towards the top, and which it is
im∣possible to come at without cutting it down. Their nest is generally
the original tenement of the squirrel, which that litttle animal bestowed
great pains in compleating; but the martin having killed and
dispossessed the little architect, takes possession of it for
its own use, enlarges its dimensions, improves the softness of the bed,
and in that retreat brings forth its young. Its litter is never above three or
four at a time; they are brought forth with the eyes closed, as in all the
rest of this kind, and very soon come to a state of perfection. The dam
compensates for her own deficiency of milk, by bringing them eggs and live
birds, accustoming them from the beginning to a life of carnage and rapine.
When she leads them from the nest into the woods, the <PB N="372" REF="433"/> birds at once distinguish their enemies and at∣tend them, as we
before observed of the fox, with all the marks of alarm and animosity.
Wherever the martin conducts her young, a flock of small birds are seen
threatening and in∣sulting her, alarming every thicket, and often directing
the hunter in his pursuit.</P>
<P>The martin is still more common in North-America than in any
part of Europe. These animals are found in all the northern parts of the
world, from Siberia to China and Canada. In every country they are hunted for
their furs, which are very valuable, and chiefly so when taken in the
beginning of winter. The most esteemed part of the martin's skin is that
part of it which is browner than the rest, and stretches along the
back-bone. Above twelve thousand of these skins are annually imported
into Eng∣land from Hudson's Bay, and above thirty thousand from Canada.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>THE SABLE.</HEAD>
<P>MOST of the classes of the weasel kind would have continued
utterly unknown and dis∣regarded were it not for their furs, which are finer,
more glossy and soft, than those of any other quadrupede. Their
dispositions are fierce and untameable; their scent generally
offensive; <PB N="373" REF="434"/> and their figure disproportioned and
unpleasing. The knowledge of one or two of them would, therefore, have
sufficed curiosity; and the rest would probably have been confounded
together, under one common name, as things useless and uninteresting, had
not their skins been coveted by the vain, and considered as capable of
adding to human magnificence or beauty.</P>
<P>Of all these, however, the skin of the sable is the most
coveted, and held in the highest esteem. It is of a brownish black, and
the darker it is it becomes the more valuable. A single skin, though not
above four inches broad, is often valued at ten or fifteen pounds<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Regnard.</BIBL></NOTE>; the fur differing from others in
this, that it has no grain; so that, rub it which way you will, it is equally
smooth and unresisting. Nevertheless, though this little animal's robe
was so much co∣veted by the great, its history till of late was but very
little known; and we are obliged to Mr. Jonelin for the first accurate
description of its form and nature<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon, vol. xxvii. p. 113.</BIBL></NOTE>. From him we learn
that the sable resembles the martin in form, and size, and the weasel
in the number of its teeth; for it is to be observed, that whereas the martin
has thirty-eight teeth, the weasel has but thirty-four; in this respect,
therefore, the sable seems to <PB N="374" REF="435"/> make the shade
between these two animals; being shaped like the one, and furnished with
teeth like the other. It is also furnished with very large whiskers about
the mouth; its feet are broad and, as in the rest of its kind, fur∣nished
with five claws on each foot. These are its constant marks; but its fur,
for which it is so much valued, is not always the same. Some of this
species are of a dark brown over all the body, except the ears and the
throat, where the hair is rather yellow; others are more of a yellowish
tincture, their ears and throat being also much paler. These in both are
the colours they have in winter, and which they are seen to change in the
beginning of the spring; the former becoming of a yellow brown, the latter of
a pale yellow. In other respects they resemble their kind, in vivacity,
agility, and inquietude; in sleeping by day and seeking their prey by
night; in living upon smaller animals, and in the disagreeable odour that
chiefly characterizes their race.</P>
<P>They generally inhabit along the banks of rivers, in shady
places, and in the thickest woods. They leap with great ease from tree to
tree, and are said to be afraid of the sun, which tarnishes the lustre
of their robes. They are chiefly hunted in winter for their skins, 
<PB N="375" REF="436"/> during which part of the year they are only in
season. They are mostly found in Siberia, and but very few in any other
country of the world; and this scarcity it is which enhances their value. The
hunting of the sable chiefly falls to the lot of the condemned criminals, who
are sent from Russia into these wild and extensive forests that,
for a great part of the year, are covered with snow; and in this instance,
as in many others, the luxuries and ornaments of the vain, are wrought out of
the dangers and the miseries of the wretched. These are obliged to
furnish a certain number of skins every year, and are punished if the
proper quantity be not pro∣vided.</P>
<P>The sable is also killed by the Russian soldiers, who
are sent into those parts to that end. They are
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ed a certain number of skins
yearly, like the former, and are obliged to shoot with only a single ball,
to avoid spoiling the skin, or else with cross-bows and blunt arrows.
As an encouragement to the hunters, they are al∣lowed to share among
themselves the surplus of those skins which they thus procure; and
this, in the process of six or seven years, amounts to a very
considerable sum. A colonel, during his seven years stay, gains about
four thousand crowns for his share, and the common men six or seven
hundred each for theirs.</P>

<PB N="376" REF="437"/>
<HEAD>THE ICHNEUMON.</HEAD>
<P>THE Ichneumon, which some have inju∣diciously denominated the
Cat of Pharaoh, is one of the boldest and most useful animals of all the
weasel kind. In the kingdom of Egypt, where it is chiefly bred, it is used
for the same purposes that cats are in Europe, and is even more
serviceable, as being more expert in catch∣ing mice than they. This animal is
usually of the size of the martin, and greatly resembles it in
appearance, except that the hair, which is of a grisly black, is much rougher
and less downy. The tail also is not so bushy at the end; and each hair
in particular has three or four colours, which are seen in different
dispo∣sitions of its body. Under its rougher hairs, there is a softer fur
of a brownish colour, the rough hair being about two inches long, but that of
the muzzle extremely short, as likewise that on the legs and paws. However,
being long since brought into a domestic state, there are many varieties
in this animal; some being much larger than the martin, others much less;
some being of a lighter mixture of colours, and some being streaked in
the manner of a cat.</P>
<P>The Ichneumon, with all the strength of a cat, has more
instinct and agility; a more uni∣versal <PB N="377" REF="438"/> appetite for
carnage, and a greater va∣riety of powers to procure it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The rest of this description is extracted from Mr. Buffon,
except where marked with commas.</NOTE>. Rats, mice, birds, serpents, lizards
and insects, are all equally pursued; it attacks every living thing which
it is able to overcome, and indiscrimi∣nately preys on flesh of all kinds.
Its courage is equal to the vehemence of its appetite. It fears neither the
force of the dog nor the insi∣dious malice of the cat; neither the claws of
the vulture nor the poison of the viper. It makes war upon all kinds of
serpents with great avidity, seizes and kills them how venomous soever
they be; and we are told that when it begins to perceive the effects of their
rage, it has recourse to a certain root, which the Indians call after its
name, and assert to be an antidote for the bite of the asp or the
viper.</P>
<P>But what this animal is particularly service∣able to the
Egyptians for is, that it discovers and destroys the eggs of the crocodile.
It also kills the young ones that have not as yet been able to reach the
water; and, as fable usually goes hand in hand with truth, it is said that
the ichneumon sometimes enters the mouth of the crocodile, when it is found
sleeping on the shore, boldly attacks the enemy in the inside, 
<PB N="378" REF="439"/> and at length, when it has effectually destroyed it,
it eats its way out again.</P>
<P>The ichneumon when wild generally resides along the banks of
rivers; and in times of inun∣dation makes to the higher ground, often
ap∣proaching inhabited places in quest of prey. It goes forward silently
and cautiously, chang∣ing its manner of moving according to its
ne∣cessities. Sometimes it carries the head high, shortens its body, and
raises itself upon its legs; sometimes it lengthens itself and seems
to creep along the ground; it is often observed to sit upon its hind legs,
like a dog when taught to beg; but more commonly it is seen to dart like an
arrow upon its prey, and seize it with inevit∣able certainty. Its eyes are
sprightly and full of fire, its physiognomy sensible, its body nimble,
its tail long, and its hair rough and various. Like all of its kind, it has
glands that open behind and furnish an odorous substance. Its nose is
too sharp and its mouth too small to permit its seizing things that are
large; however, it makes up by its courage and activity its want of arms; it
easily strangles a cat though stronger and larger than itself; and
often fights with dogs, which, though never so bold, learn to dread the
ichneumon as a formidable enemy. It also takes the water like an otter, and,
as we are told, will continue under it much longer.</P>
<P><PB N="379" REF="440"/>This animal grows fast and dies soon. It
is found in great numbers in all the southern parts of Asia, from Egypt to
Java; and it is also found in Africa, particularly at the Cape of Good Hope.
It is domestic, as was said, in Egypt; but in our colder climates it is not
easy to breed or maintain them, as they are not able to support the rigour
of our winters. Ne∣vertheless they take every precaution that in∣stinct can
dictate to keep themselves warm; they wrap themselves up into a ball,
hiding the head between the legs, and in this manner continue to sleep all
day long. 
<Q REND="inline">"Seba had one sent him from the island of
Ceylon, which he permitted to run for some months about the house. It was
heavy and slothful by day, and often could not be awaked even with a blow;
but it made up this indolence by its nocturnal activity, smelling about
without either being wholly tame or wholly mischievous. It climbed up the
walls and the trees with very great ease, and appeared extremely fond of
spiders and worms, which it preferred probably from their resemblance to
serpents, its most na∣tural food. It was also particularly eager to
scratch up holes in the ground; and, this added to its wildness and
uncleanliness, obliged our naturalist to smother it in spirits, in
order <PB N="380" REF="441"/> to preserve, and add it to the rest of his
col∣lection."</Q></P>
<P>This animal was one of those formerly wor∣shipped by the
Egyptians, who considered every thing that was serviceable to them as an
ema∣nation of the Deity, and worshipped such as the best
representatives of God below. Indeed, if we consider the number of eggs
which the cro∣codile lays in the sand at a time, which often amount to three
or four hundred, we have rea∣son to admire this little animal's
usefulness as well as industry in destroying them, since other∣wise
the crocodile might be produced in suf∣ficient numbers to over-run the whole
earth.</P>

<HEAD>THE STINKARDS.</HEAD>
<P>THIS is a name which our sailors give to one or two animals of
the weasel kind, which are chiefly found in America. All the weasel kind,
as was already observed, have a very strong smell; some of them indeed
approaching to a perfume, but the greatest number most insupportably
foetid. But the smell of our weasels, and ermines, and polecats, is
fragrance itself when compared to that of the <HI>squash</HI> and the
<HI>skink,</HI> which have been called the Polecats of America. These two
are found in different parts of America, both differing in colour and

</FIGURE> <PB N="381" REF="443"/> fur, but both obviously of the
weasel kind, as appears not only from their figure and odour, but also from
their disposition. The <HI>squash</HI> is about the size of a
polecat, its hair of a deep brown, but principally differing from all of this
kind in having only four toes on the feet before, whereas all other weasels
have five. The <HI>skink,</HI> which I take to be Catesby's Virginia
polecat, resembles a polecat in shape and size, but par∣ticularly differs
in the length of its hair and colour. The hair is above three inches and an
half long, and that at the end of the tail above four inches. The colour is
partly black and partly white, variously disposed over the body, very
glossy, long, and beautiful. There seem to be two varieties more of this
animal, which Mr. Buffon calls the Conepate and the Zorille. He supposes
each to be a distinct species: but as they are both said to resemble
the polecat in form, and both to be cloathed with long fur of a black and white
colour, it seems needless to make a distinction. The conepate resembles
the skink in all things except in size, being smaller, and in the
disposition of its colours, which are more exact, having five white
stripes upon a black ground, running longitudinally from the head to the
tail. The Zorille resembles the skink, but is rather smaller and more
beauti∣fully <PB REF="444"/> <GAP DESC="duplicate" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/> 
<PB N="381" REF="445"/> <GAP DESC="duplicate" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/> 
<PB N="382" REF="446"/> coloured, its streaks of black and white being more
distinct, and the colours of its tail being black at its insertion and
white at the ex∣tremity; whereas in the skink they are all of one grey
colour.</P>
<P>But whatever differences there may be in the figure or colour of
these little animals, they all agree in one common affection, that of being
intolerably foetid and loathsome. I have already observed that all the
weasel kind have glands furnishing an odorous matter, near the anus, the
conduits of which generally have their aperture just at its opening. That
substance which is stored up in these receptacles, is in some of this
kind, such as in the martin, already mentioned, and also in the genet and
the civet, to be described hereafter, a most grateful per∣fume; but in the
weasel, the ermine, the ferret, and the polecat, it is extremely foetid and
of∣fensive. These glands in the animals now under consideration are much
larger, and furnish a matter sublimed to a degree of putrescence that is
truly amazing. As to the perfumes of musk and civet, we know that a single
grain will dif∣fuse itself over a whole house, and continue for months to
spread an agreeable odour, without diminution. However, the perfume of the
musk or the civet is nothing, either for strength or <PB N="383" REF="447"/>
duration, to the insupportable odour of these. It is usually voided with
their excrement; and if but a single drop happens to touch any part of a
man's garment, it is more than probable that he can never wear any part of it
more.</P>
<P>In describing the effects produced by the ex∣crement of these
animals, we often hear of its raising this diabolical smell by its urine.
How∣ever, of this I am apt to doubt; and it should seem to me, that, as all
the weasel kind have their excrements so extremely foetid from the cause
above-mentioned, we may consider these also as being foetid from the
same causes. Besides, they are not furnished with glands to give their
urine such a smell; and the analogy between them and the weasel kind
being so strong in other respects, we may suppose they resemble
each other in this. It has also been said that they take this method of
ejecting their excre∣ment to defend themselves against their pur∣suers;
but it is much more probable that this ejection is the convulsive effect of
terror, and that it serves as their defence without their own concurrence.
Certain it is that they never smell thus horridly except when enraged or
affrighted, for they are often kept tame about the houses of the planters of
America without being very offensive.</P>
<P><PB N="384" REF="448"/>The habitudes of all these animals are the
same, living like all the rest of the weasel kind, as they prey upon
smaller animals and birds eggs. The squash, for instance, burrows like
the pole∣cat in the clefts of rocks, where it brings forth its young. It often
steals into farm-yards, and kills the poultry, eating only their brains. Nor
is it safe to pursue or offend it, for then it calls up all its scents,
which are its most powerful protection. At that time neither men nor dogs
will offer to approach it; the scent is so strong that it reaches for
half a mile round, and more near at hand is almost stifling. If the dogs
continue to pursue, it does all in its power to escape, by getting up a
tree, or by some such means; but if driven to an extremity, it then lets
fly upon the hunters; and if it should happen that a drop of this foetid
discharge falls in the eye, the person runs the risque of being blinded
for ever<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Voyage de Kalm, as quoted by Buffon, vol
xxvii. p. 93.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P>The dogs themselves instantly abate of their ardour when they
find this extraordinary battery played off against them; they instantly
turn tail, and leave the animal undisputed master of the field; and no
exhortations can ever bring them to rally. 
<Q REND="inline">"In the year 1749," says Kalm, "one of these
animals came near the farm where I <PB N="385" REF="449"/> lived. It was in
winter time, and during the night; and the dogs that were upon the watch,
pursued it for some time, until it discharged against them. Although I
was in my bed a good way off, I thought I should have been suffocated; and
the cows and oxen themselves, by their lowings, shewed how much they were
affected by the stench. About the end of the same year, another of these
animals crept into our cellar, but did not exhale the smallest scent,
because it was not disturbed. A foolish woman, however, who perceived it
at night, by the shining of its eyes, killed it, and at that moment its
stench began to spread. The whole cellar was filled with it to such a
degree, that the woman kept her bed for several days after; and all the
bread, meat, and other provisions, that were kept there, were so infected,
that they were obliged to be thrown out of doors."</Q> Nevertheless, many of
the planters, and the native Americans, keep this animal tame about their
houses; and seldom perceive any disagreeable scents, except it is
injured or frighted. They are also known to eat its flesh, which some
assert to be tolerable food; however, they take care to deprive it of
those glands which are so horridly offensive.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<PB N="386" REF="450"/>
<HEAD>THE GENETT.</HEAD>
<P>FROM the squash, which is the most of∣fensive animal in
nature, we come to the Genett, which is one of the most beautiful and
pleasing. Instead of the horrid stench with which the for∣mer affects us,
this has a most grateful odour; more faint than civet, but to some, for
that reason, more agreeable. This animal is rather less than the martin;
though there are genetts of different sizes; and I have seen one rather
larger. It also differs somewhat in the form of its body. It is not easy,
in words, to give an idea of the distinction. It resembles all those of
the weasel kind, in its length, compared to its heighth; it resembles them
in having a soft beautiful fur, in having its feet armed with claws that
cannot be sheathed, and in its appe∣tite for petty carnage. But then it
differs from them in having the nose much smaller and longer, rather
resembling that of a fox than a weasel. The tail also, instead of being
bushy, tapers to a point, and is much longer; its ears are larger, and its
paws smaller. As to its colours, and figure in general, the genett is
spotted with black, upon a ground mixed with red and grey. It has two sorts
of hair, the one shorter and <PB N="387" REF="451"/> softer, the other
longer and stronger, but not above half an inch long on any part of its body,
except the tail. Its spots are distinct and separate upon the sides,
but unite towards the back, and form black stripes, which run longitudinally
from the neck backwards. It has also along the back a kind of mane or
longish hair, which forms a black streak from the head to the tail, which
last is marked with rings, al∣ternately black and white, its whole
length.</P>
<P>The genett, like all the rest of the weasel kinds, has glands,
that separate a kind of per∣fume, resembling civet, but which soon flies
off. These glands open differently from those of other animals of this
kind; for, as the latter have their apertures just at the opening of the
anus, these have their aperture immediately under it; so that the male
seems, for this reason, to the superficial observer, to be of two
sexes.</P>
<P>It resembles the martin very much in its habits and
disposition<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon, vol. xix. p.
187.</BIBL></NOTE>; except, that it seems tamed much more easily. Bellonius
assures us, that he has seen them in the houses at Constan∣tinople as
tame as cats; and that they were permitted to run every where about, without
doing the least mischief. For this reason they <PB N="388" REF="452"/>
have been called the Cats of Constantinople; although they have little else
in common with that animal, except their skill in spying out and
destroying vermin. Naturalists pretend that it inhabits only the moister
grounds, and chiefly resides along the banks of rivers, having never been
found in mountains, nor dry places. The species is not much diffused; it is
not to be found in any part of Europe, except Spain and Turky; it requires a
warm climate to subsist and multiply in; and yet it is not to be found in
the warmer regions either of India or Africa. From such as have seen its
uses at Constanti∣nople, I learn, that it is one of the most beau∣tiful,
cleanly, and industrious animals in the world; that it keeps whatever house
it is in, perfectly free from mice and rats, which cannot endure its smell.
Add to this, its nature is mild and gentle, its colours various and glossy,
its fur valuable; and, upon the whole, it seems to be one of those animals
that, with proper care, might be propagated amongst us, and might become one
of the most serviceable of our domestics.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>THE CIVET.</HEAD>
<P>PROCEEDING from the smaller to the greater of this kind, we
come, in the last place, <PB N="389" REF="453"/> to the Civet, which is much
larger than any of the former; for as the martin is not above six∣teen inches
long, the civet is found to be above thirty. Mr. Buffon distinguishes this
species into two kinds; one of which he calls the Civet, and the other the
Zibet. The latter principally differs from the former in having the body longer
and more slender, the nose smaller, the ears longer and broader; no mane
or long hair running down the back in the latter; and the tail is longer and
better marked with rings of different colours, from one end to the other.
These are the differences which have induced this great naturalist to
suppose them animals of distinct species; and to allot each a
separate description. How far future experience may confirm this
conjecture, time must discover; but certain it is, that if such small
varieties make a separate class, there may be many other animals equally
entitled to peculiar distinction that now are classed together. We
shall, therefore, content ourselves, at present, with considering, as
former naturalists have done, these two merely as varieties of the same
animal, and only altered in figure, by climate, food, or education.</P>
<P>The civet resembles animals of the weasel kind in the long
slenderness of its body, the <PB N="390" REF="454"/> shortness of its
legs, the odorous matter that exudes from the glands behind, the softness
of its fur, the number of its claws, and their inca∣pacity of being sheathed.
It differs from them in being much larger than any hitherto described; in
having the nose lengthened, so as to resemble that of the fox; the tail
long, and tapering to a point; and its ears strait, like those of a cat.
The colour of the civet varies: it is com∣monly ash, spotted with black;
though it is whiter in the female, tending to yellow; and the spots are much
larger, like those of a panther. The colour on the belly, and under the
throat, is black; whereas the other parts of the body are black or streaked
with grey. This animal varies in its colour, being sometimes streaked, as
in our kind of cats called Tabbies. It has whiskers, like the rest of its
kind; and its eye is black and beautiful.</P>
<P>The opening of the pouch or bag, which is the receptacle of the
civet, differs from that of the rest of the weasel kind, not opening into
but under the anus. Beside this opening, which is large, there is still
another lower down; but for what purposes designed, is not known. The pouch
itself is about two inches and an half broad, and two long; its opening makes
a chink, from the top downwards, that is about <PB N="391" REF="455"/> two
inches and an half long; and it is covered on the edges, and within, with
short hair: when the two sides are drawn asunder, the in∣ward cavity may
be seen, large enough to hold a small pullet's egg; all round this are
small glands, opening and furnishing that strong perfume which is so
well known, and is found, in this pouch, of the colour and consistence of
pomatum. Those who make it their business to breed these animals for
their perfume, usu∣ally take it from them twice or thrice a week, and
sometimes oftener. The animal is kept in a long sort of a box, in which it
cannot turn round. The person, therefore, opens this box behind, drags the
animal backwards by the tail, keeps it in this position by a bar before, and,
with a wooden spoon, takes the civet from the pouch, as carefully as he can;
then lets the tail go, and shuts the box again. The perfume, thus procured,
is put into a vessel, which he takes care to keep shut; and when a
sufficient quantity is procured, it is sold to very great advantage.</P>
<P>The civet<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon, vol.
xix.</BIBL></NOTE>, although a native of the warmest climates, is yet found
to live in tem∣perate, and even cold countries, provided it be defended
carefully from the injuries of the air. <PB N="392" REF="456"/> Wherefore, it is
not only bred among the Turks, the Indians, and Africans, but great numbers of
these animals are also bred in Hol∣land, where this scraping people make
no small gain of its perfume. The perfume of Amsterdam is reckoned the
purest of any; the people of other countries adulterating it with gums, and
other matters, which diminish its value, but encrease its weight. The
quantity which a single animal affords generally depends upon its health and
nourishment. It gives more in pro∣portion as it is more delicately and
abundantly fed. Raw flesh, hashed small, eggs, rice, birds, young fowls,
and particularly fish, are the kinds of food the civet most delights in.
These are to be changed and altered, to suit and entice its appetite, and
continue its health. It gets but very little water; and although it drinks but
rarely, yet it makes urine very frequently; and, upon such occasions, we
cannot, as in other animals, distinguish the male from the female.</P>
<P>The perfume of the civet is so strong that it communicates
itself to all parts of the animal's body; the fur is impregnated thereby, and
the skin penetrated to such a degree that it con∣tinues to preserve the
odour for a long time after it is stript off. If a person be shut up with
one <PB N="393" REF="457"/> of them in a close room, he cannot support the
perfume, which is so copiously diffused. When the animal is irritated, as
in all the weasel kind, its scent is much more violent than ordinary; and
if it be tormented so as to make it sweat, this also is a strong
perfume, and serves to adul∣terate or encrease what is otherwise obtained
from it In general, it is sold in Holland, for about fifty shillings an
ounce; though, like all other commodities, its value alters in propor∣tion to
the demand. Civet must be chosen new, of a good consistence, a
whitish colour, and a strong, disagreeable smell. There is still a
very considerable traffic carried on from Busserah, Calicut, and other
places in India, where the animal that produces it is bred; from the Levant
also, from Guinea, and especially from Brasil, in South America,
al∣though Mr. Buffon is of opinion that the ani∣mal is a native only of the Old
Continent, and not to be found wild in the New. The best civet, however, is
furnished, as was observed, by the Dutch, though not in such quantities
at present as some years past, when this perfume was more in fashion.
Civet is a much more grateful perfume than musk, to which it has some
resemblance; and was some years ago used for the same purposes in
medicine. But, <PB N="394" REF="458"/> at present, it is quite discontinued
in pre∣scription; and persons of taste or elegance seem to proscribe
it even from the toilet. Perfumes, like dress, have their vicissitudes;
musk was in peculiar repute, until displaced by civet; both gave ground,
upon discovering the manner of preparing ambergrease; and even this is now
difused for the less powerful vegetable kinds of fragrance, spirit of
lavender, or otter of roses.</P>
<P>As to the rest, the civet is said to be a wild fierce animal;
and, although sometimes tamed, is never thoroughly familiar. Its teeth are
strong and cutting, although its claws be feeble and inflexible. It is light
and active, and lives by prey, as the rest of its kind, pursuing birds, and
other small animals that it is able to over∣come. They are sometimes seen
stealing into the yards and outhouses, to seize upon the poultry: their
eyes shine in the night, and it is very probable that they see better in
the dark than by day. When they fail of animal food, they are found to
subsist upon roots and fruits, and very seldom drink; for which
reason they are never found near great waters. They breed very fast in
their native climates, where the heat seems to condu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e to their propagation; but in our temperate latitudes,
although they furnish their perfume in great quantities, yet <PB REF="459"/>

<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>THE GLUTTON.</HEAD>
<P>I WILL add but one animal more to this numerous class of the
weasel kind; namely, the Glutton; which, for several reasons, seems to
belong to this tribe, and this only. We have hitherto had no precise
description of this quadrupede; some resembling it to a badger, some to
a fox, and some to an hyaena. Lin∣naeus places it among the weasels, from
the similitude of its teeth; it should seem to me to resemble this
animal still more, from the great length of its body, and the shortness
of its legs, from the softness of its fur, its disagreeable scent, and
its insatiable appetite for animal food. Mr. Klein, who saw one of them
which was brought alive from Siberia, assures us, that it was about three
feet long<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He says it was an ell, eight inches long; I
have, therefore, given its length as supposing it to be a Flemish ell,
which is twenty-seven inches.</NOTE>, and about a foot and an half high. If
we compare these dimensions with those of other animals, we shall find,
that they approach more nearly to the class we are at <PB N="396" REF="463"/>
present describing than any other; and that the glutton may very justly
be conceived under the form of a great overgrown weasel. Its nose, its
ears, its teeth, and its long bushy tail, are entirely similar; and as to
what is said of its being rather corpulent than slender, it is most
probable that those who described it thus saw it after eating, at which
time its belly we are assured is most monstrously distended:
however, suspending all certainty upon this subject, I will take leave
rather to follow Linnaeus than Buffon in describing this animal; and leave
future experience to judge between them.</P>
<P>The glutton, which is so called from its vo∣racious appetite, is
an animal found as well in the north of Europe and Siberia, as in the north
parts of America, where it has the name of the Carcajou. Amidst the variety
of descrip∣tions which have been given of it, no very just idea can be
formed of its figure; and, indeed, some naturalists, among whom was Ray,
en∣tirely doubted of its existence. From the best accounts, however, we
have of it, the body is thick and long, the legs short; it is black along the
back, and of a reddish brown on the sides; its fur is held in the highest
estimation, for its softness and beautiful gloss; the tail is bushy,
like that of the weasel, but rather shorter; and <PB N="397" REF="464"/> its
legs and claws better fitted for climbing trees, than for running along the
ground. Thus far it entirely resembles the weasel; and its manner of taking
its prey is also by surprize, and not by pursuit.</P>
<P>Scarce any of the animals with short legs and long bodies,
pursue their prey; but, know∣ing their own incapacity to overtake it by
swiftness, either creep upon it in its retreats, or wait in ambush, and
seize it with a bound. The glutton, from the make of its legs, and the length
of its body, must be particularly slow; and, consequently, its only
resource is in taking its prey by surprize. All the rest of the weasel
kind, from the smallness of their size, are better fitted for a life of
insidious ra∣pine than this; they can pursue their prey into its retreats,
they can lurk unseen among the branches of trees, and hide themselves with
ease under the leaves: but the glutton is too large to follow small prey
into their retreats; nor would such, even if obtained, be sufficient to
sustain it. For these reasons, therefore, this animal seems naturally
compelled to the life for which it has long been remarkable. Its only
resource is to climb a tree, which it does with great ease, and there it
waits with patience until some large animal passes underneath, upon 
<PB N="398" REF="465"/> which it darts down with unerring certainty, and
destroys it.</P>
<P>It is chiefly in North America that this vo∣racious creature is
seen lurking among the thick branches of trees, in order to surprize the
deer, with which the extensive forests of that part of the world abound.
Endued with a degree of patience equal to its rapacity, the glutton singles
out such trees as it observes marked by the teeth or the antlers of the
deer; and is known to remain there watching for several days together. If it
has fixed upon a wrong tree, and finds that the deer have either left that part
of the country, or cautiously shun the place, it reluctantly descends,
pursues the beaver to its retreat, or even ventures into the water in
pursuit of fishes. But if it happens that, by long attention, and keeping
close, at last the elk or the rein-deer happens to pass that way, it at
once darts down upon them, sticks its claws between their shoulders, and
remains there unalterably firm. It is in vain that the large frighted animal
encreases its speed, or threatens with its branching horns; the glut∣ton
having taken possession of its post, nothing can drive it off; its
enormous prey drives ra∣pidly along amongst the thickest woods, rubs
itself against the largest trees and tears down <PB N="399" REF="466"/>
the branches with its expanded horns; but still its insatiable foe sticks
behind, eating its neck, and digging its passage to the great
blood-vessels that lie in that part. Travellers who wander through those
desarts, often see pieces of the glutton's skin sticking to the trees,
against which it was rubbed by the deer. But the animal's voracity is greater
than its feelings, and it never seizes without bringing down its prey. When,
therefore, the deer, wounded, and feeble with the loss of blood, falls, the
glutton is seen to make up for its former ab∣stinence, by its present
voracity. As it is not possessed of a feast of this kind every day,
it resolves to lay in a store to serve it for a good while to come. It is
indeed amazing how much one of these animals can eat at a time! That which
was seen by Mr. Klein, although without exercise or air, although taken
from its native climate, and enjoying but an indifferent state of health, was
yet seen to eat thirteen pounds of flesh every day, and yet remained
unsatisfied. We may, therefore, easily conceive how much more it must
devour at once, after a long fast, of a food of its own procuring, and in the
climate most natural to its constitution. We are told, accordingly, that
from being a lank thin animal, which it naturally is, it then gorges 
<PB N="400" REF="467"/> in such quantities, that its belly is distended, and
its whole figure seems to alter. Thus vo∣raciously it continues eating
till, incapable of any other animal function, it lies totally torpid by the
animal it has killed; and in this situation continues for two or three days.
In this loath∣some and helpless state it finds its chief pro∣tection from
its horrid smell, which few ani∣mals care to come near<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Linnaei Syst. p. 67.</BIBL></NOTE>; so that it continues
eating and sleeping till its prey be devoured, bones and all; and then it
mounts a tree, in quest of another adventure.</P>
<P>The glutton, like many others of the weasel kind, seems to
prefer the most putrid flesh to that newly killed; and such is the
voracious∣ness of this hateful creature, that, if its swiftness and
strength were equal to its rapacity, it would soon thin the forest of
every other living crea∣ture. But, fortunately, it is so slow that there is
scarce a quadrupede that cannot escape it, ex∣cept the beaver. This,
therefore, it very fre∣quently pursues upon land; but the beaver ge∣nerally
makes good its retreat by taking to the water, where the glutton has no chance
to suc∣ceed. This pursuit only happens in summer; for in the winter all
that remains is to attack the beaver's house, as at that time it never
stirs <PB N="401" REF="468"/> from home. This attack, however, seldom
succeeds; for the beaver has a covert way bored under the ice, and the
glutton has only the trouble and disappointment of sacking an empty
town.</P>
<P>A life of necessity generally produces a good fertile
invention. The glutton, continually pressed by the call of appetite, and
having neither swiftness nor activity to satisfy it, is obliged to make
up by stratagem the defects of nature. It is often seen to examine the
traps and the snares laid for other animals, in order to anticipate the
fowlers. It is said to practise a thousand arts to procure its prey, to
steal upon the retreats of the rein-deer, the flesh of which animal it
loves in preference to all others; to lie in wait for such animals as have
been maimed by the hunters; to pursue the isatis while it is hunting for
itself; and, when that animal has run down its prey, to come in and seize
upon the whole, and sometimes to devour even its poor provider; when these
pursuits fail, even to dig up the graves, and fall upon the bodies in∣terred
there, devouring them bones and all. For these reasons, the natives of the
countries where the glutton inhabits, hold it in utter detestation, and
usually term it the vulture of quadrupedes. And yet, it is extraordinary
enough, that, being <PB N="402" REF="469"/> so very obnoxious to man, it does
not seem to fear him<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon.</BIBL></NOTE>. We
are told by Gemelin of one of these coming up boldly and calmly where there
were several persons at work, without testifying the smallest
apprehension, or attempting to run until it had received several blows,
that at last totally disabled it. In all probability it came among them
seeking its prey; and, having been used to attack animals of inferior
strength, it had no idea of a force superior to its own. The glutton, like
all the rest of its kind, is a solitary animal; and is never seen in
company except with its female, with which it couples in the midst of winter.
The latter goes with young about four months, and brings forth two or three at
a time<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Linnaei System. p.
67.</BIBL></NOTE>. They burrow in holes as the weasel; and the male and
female are ge∣nerally found together, both equally resolute in defence of
their young. Upon this occasion the boldest dogs are afraid to approach
them; they fight obstinately and bite most cruelly. However, as they are
unable to escape by flight, the hunters come in to the assistance of
the dogs, and easily overpower them. Their flesh, it may readily be
supposed, is not fit to be eaten; but the skins amply recompence the
hunters for their toil and danger. The fur has <PB N="403" REF="470"/> the
most beautiful lustre that can be imagined, and is preferred before all
others, except that of the Siberian fox, or the sable. Among other
peculiarities of this animal, Linnaeus informs us, that it is very difficult to
be skinned; but from what cause, whether its abominable stench, or the
skin's tenacity to the flesh, he has not thought fit to inform us.</P>
