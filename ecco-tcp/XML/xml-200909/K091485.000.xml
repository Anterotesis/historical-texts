<P>AND such, <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> are you, the Incouragers of Learn∣ing, and the Rewarders of Merit; there are Numbers to witness the one, and your <HI>Clergy</HI> may witness the other.</P>
<P>FOR not to mention you

<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE following Sheets are a few of that vast Number of <HI>Ceremonies</HI> and <HI>Opi∣nions,</HI> which are held by the Common People; such as they solely or generally observe. For tho' some of them have been of National and others perhaps of universal Obser∣vance, yet at present they would have little or no Being, if not observed among the Vulgar.</P>
<P><PB N="x" REF="9"/>I would not be thought a Reviver of old Rites and Ceremonies to the Burden∣ing of the People, nor an Abolisher of in∣nocent Customs, which are their Pleasures and Recreations: I aim at nothing, but a Regulation of those which are in Being amongst them, which they themselves are far from thinking burdensome, and aboli∣shing such only as are sinful and wicked.</P>
<P>Some of the Customs they hold, have been originally good, tho' at present they retain little of their primitive Purity; the true Meaning and Design of them, be∣ing either lost, or very much in the Dark through Folly and Superstition. To wipe off therefore the Dust they have contract∣ed, to clear them of Superstition, and make known their End and Design, may turn to some Account, and be of Advan∣tage; whereas observing them in the pre∣sent
<PB N="xi" REF="10"/>
Way, is not only of no Advantage, but of very great Detriment.</P>
<P>Others they hold, are really sinful, not∣withstanding in outward Appearance they seem very harmless, being a Scandal to Religion, and an encouraging of Wicked∣ness. And therefore to aim at abolish∣ing these, will I hope be no Crime, tho' they be the Diversions of the People.</P>
<P>As to the Opinions they hold, they are almost all superstitious, being gene∣rally either the Produce of Heathenism; or the Inventions of indolent <HI>Monks,</HI> who having nothing else to do, were the Forgers of many silly and wicked Opi∣nions, to keep the World in Awe and Ig∣norance. And indeed the ignorant Part of the World, is still so aw'd, that they follow the idle Traditions of the one,
<PB N="xii" REF="11"/>
more than the Word of GOD; and have more Dependance upon the lucky Omens of the other than his Providence, more Dread of their unlucky ones, than his Wrath and Punishment.</P>
<P>The regulating therefore of these Opi∣nions and Customs, is what I propos'd by the following Compositions, whatever has been suggested to the contrary: And as to the Menaces of some, and the Censures of others, I neither fear nor regard them. I shall be always ready to own any Mi∣stake, and in what I justly may, to vin∣dicate my self.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. I.</HI> Of the Soul-Bell, its Antiquity, the Reason of its Institution, the Benefit and Ad∣vantage of it, an Exhortation to the Use of it according to its first Institution.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE Ceremony of Tolling the Bell at the Time of Death, seems to be as ancient as the having of Bells themselves; we are told, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Bingham</HI>'s Orig. Eccl. Lib. 3.</NOTE> it was about the seventh Century when Bells were first in the Church, and that venerable <HI>Bede</HI> is the first
<PB N="2" REF="21"/>
that mentions them. If this be true, then it is as true, that the Tolling of the Bell was insti∣tuted about that Time; for where our Coun∣try-man mentions the Word <HI>Campana,</HI> or Bell, there it also is, that we find a Bell made use of for the Dead: <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Haec, tunc in dormitorio sororum pausans, exaudivit subito in aere notum campanae sonum, quo ad orationes ex∣citari vel convocati solebant, cum quis eorum de seculo <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uisset evocatus. <HI>Bed. Eccl. Hist. Lib.</HI> 4. <HI>Cap.</HI> 23.</NOTE> For at the Death of the Abbess St. <HI>Hilda,</HI> he tells us that one of the Si∣sters of a distant Monastery, as she was sleeping, thought she heard the well known Sound of that Bell, which called them to Prayers, when any of them had departed this Life. But be that as it will, it is evident, that the Bell was tolled up∣on this Occasion about <HI>Bede</HI>'s Time, and conse∣quently that the Ceremony is as ancient, as his Days.</P>
<P>THE Reason why this Custom was instituted, was not, as some seem to imagine, for no other End than to acquaint the Neighbourhood, that such a Person was dead; but chiefly, that who∣ever heard the Noise of the Bell, should put up their Prayers for the Soul: Thus the Fa∣ther
<PB N="3" REF="22"/>
above-mentioned tells us again, <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Quod cum illa audisset, suscitavit cunctas sorores &amp; in ecclesiam convocatas, orationibus &amp; psalmis pro anima ma∣tris operam dare monuit. <HI>ibid.</HI></NOTE> That she who presided in this Monastery, had no sooner heard this, than she raised all the Sisters, and called them into the Church, where she exhorted them to pray fervently, and sing a <HI>Re∣quiem</HI> for the Soul of their Mother. <HI>Cassalion</HI> also upon this Place of <HI>Bede,</HI> says, <HI>That</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Et talis ritus etiam de praesenti servatur in <HI>Anglia,</HI> ut cum quis decessit, statim campana propriae illius Pa∣rochiae speciali quodam modo sonat per aliquod temporis spatium.—Quamvis <HI>Angli</HI> negent modo orationes &amp; suf∣fragia defunctis proficua; non aliam tamen in hoc ab illis rationem potui percipere, quam quod talis sonus sit ritus antiquae ecclesiae <HI>Anglicanae, Cassali</HI> de vet Sac. Christ. Rit. P. 241.</NOTE> <HI>the same Custom is still observed in</HI> England, <HI>that as soon as any hath departed this Life, the Bell be∣longing to the Parish he liv'd in, was immedi∣ately tolled, and for some Time.—And tho'</HI> (says he) <HI>the</HI> English <HI>now deny, that Prayers are of any Service to the Dead; yet I could meet with no other Account of this Ceremony, than that it was a Custom of the old Church of</HI> England.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="23"/>AND for this Reason it is, that this Custom was first observed, and should be still retain'd among us, <HI>viz.</HI> That the Prayers of the Faith∣ful may be assisting to the Soul; and certainly it might be more profitably retain'd, were it so order'd, that the Bell should be tolled before the Person's Departure, as was undoubtedly de∣signed when this Ceremony was continued, that good Men might give him their Prayers. Was this always so observed, there might be some <HI>Moses</HI> amongst the Number of the Faithful, whose Prayers could prevail upon GOD, to beat back <HI>the Amalekites of Darkness;</HI> some whose <HI>Faith</HI> might remove a <HI>Mountain of Sins,</HI> and some whose Tears procure a Multitude of Mer∣cies. O the Comfort of <HI>the Forgivenness of Sins!</HI> Of <HI>being guided safely through the Sha∣dow of Death!</HI> Of arriving securely at the Hea∣venly Country! What is it that Prayer can't obtain?</P>
<P>BUT tho' the Wickedness and Impenitency of the dying Person be such, as that the Pray∣ers of the Faithful will not be sufficient to avert the Wrath and Punishment of a justly incensed
<PB N="5" REF="24"/>
GOD; yet as this can be only known to GOD, it will not discharge Men from recommending him to the Divine Mercy, in the most passionate and affectionate Manner. They thereby ex∣press the most laudable Zeal, the most disinte∣rested Charity; and whilst they are so sollici∣tous for the Happiness and Welfare of other Mens Souls, they cannot but be thereby influ∣enced to have the greatest Concern for their own, and be both encouraged and directed to proceed with an holy Emulation <HI>from Strength to Strength,</HI> and endeavour as the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Heb. vi. 1.</NOTE> Apostle ad∣vises, <HI>to go on to Perfection.</HI></P>
<P>BUT, alas! we are fallen into Times of such Irreligion and Prejudice, such Contempt of An∣tiquity, and such too great Reformation, that what with Indolence on one Hand, and Igno∣rance on the other; what with no Zeal on this Side, and too <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Among the many Objections of the <HI>Brownists,</HI> it is laid to the Charge of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> That tho' we deny the Doctrine of Purgatory, and teach the contrary; yet how well our Practice suits with it, may be considered in our Ring∣ing of hallowed Bells for the Soul. Bish. <HI>Hall.</HI> cont. <HI>Brown.</HI></NOTE> false a one on that; we either neglect the most decent Ceremonies of Religion,
<PB N="6" REF="25"/>
or we think it is Religion to have no Ceremo∣nies at all. No Wonder then, that, <HI>in the Midst of such a crooked and perverse Generation,</HI> when the most of Men are negligent of themselves, they are also negligent of others: No Wonder, that when there is such a general Contempt of Religion, and Men are careless of their own Souls, they are not careful for the Souls of their Friends.</P>
<P>BUT it is called <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>In a Vestry-Book belonging to the Chappel of</HI> All-Saints <HI>in</HI> Newcastle <HI>upon</HI> Tyne, <HI>it is observeable, That the Tolling of the Bell is not mention'd in the Parish Accounts, from the Year</HI> 1643, <HI>till</HI> 1655, <HI>when we find it order'd to be tolled again. At a Vestry holden</HI> January <HI>21st</HI> 1655. Whereas for some Years past, the collecting of the Duty for Bell and Tolling, hath been forborn and laid aside, which hath much lessen'd the Revenue of the Church, by which, and such like Means, it is brought into Dilapidations; and hav∣ing now taken the same into serious Consideration, and fully debated the Objections made by some against the same, and having had the Judgment of our Ministers con∣cerning any Superstition that might be in it; which being made clear, it is this Day order'd, That from henceforth, the Church-Officer appointed thereunto, do collect the same, and bring the Money unto the Church-Wardens, and that those who desire to have the Use of the Bells, may freely have them as formerly, paying the accustom'd Fees. <HI>It is certain they laid it aside, because they thought it superstitious, and it is probable, if they had not wanted Mo∣ney, they had not seen the contrary.</HI></NOTE> Popish and Superstitious;
<PB N="7" REF="26"/>
for what true Reason, I know not. Did we in∣deed imagine with the Papists, that there is any <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">We call them Soul-Bells, for that they signifie the De∣parture of the Soul, not for that they help the Passage of the Soul. Bish. <HI>Hall</HI> cont. <HI>Brown.</HI> P. <HI>568.</HI></NOTE> Virtue or extraordinary Power in a Bell, that it is <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Item ut Daemones tinnitu campanarum, Christianos ad preces concitantium, terreantur. Formula vero bap∣tizandi seu benedicendi campanas antiqua est. <HI>Durant. Lib. C.</HI> 22. <HI>S.</HI> 6.</NOTE> hallowed by Baptism, and drives away the Spirits of Darkness, then it might justly be called Superstition, and therefore just∣ly abolished. But when we retain the Custom, only to procure the Prayers of the Faithful for a departing Soul, it would surely be of Advan∣tage to observe it, if the <HI>Prayers of a righteous Man avail</HI> any Thing at all; which, if we may believe an inspir'd Apostle, are of very great Efficacy and Validity.</P>
<P>ART thou then attending a Friend in his last Moments? Art thou careful for his Soul, and sollicitous for his Salvation? Dost thou wish him safe <HI>through the Valley of Death to the ever∣lasting Hills?</HI> Wouldst thou have the good An∣gels
<PB N="8" REF="27"/>
protect him, and be his <HI>Shield against the Powers of Darkness?</HI> In short, wouldst thou have him crown'd with the Joys of <HI>Paradise?</HI> Be assured then, that the Prayers of good Men will very much contribute to the gaining of these Things. But how shall they then pray for him, if they know not of his Departure? And how can they know that, without the Tol∣ling of the Bell? Do thou therefore put in Practice this decent and profitable Custom, not as our Age generally does, after the Death of thy Friend, but before it; before he leave the World, when the Prayers of good Men can assist him, and facilitate his Journey into the other Life.</P>
<P>OR art thou <HI>working in the Field, or grind∣ing at the Mill?</HI> Remember then, when thou hearest the Sound of the Bell for one departing, that thou put up thy Prayers for him. Be thy Business what it will, it will always permit thee to say at least, <HI>LORD, now lettest thou thy Servant depart in Peace:</HI> Or to use the Words of St. <HI>Oswald,</HI> when he and his Sol∣diers were ready to be slain, <HI>LORD, have
<PB N="9" REF="28"/>
Mercy on the Soul of thy</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Oravit ad dominum pro animabus exercitus sui. Un∣de dicunt in proverbio, Deus miserere animabus, dixit <HI>Os∣waldus</HI> cadens in terram, <HI>Bed. Eccl. L.</HI> 3. <HI>C.</HI> 12. <HI>It is used</HI> (says <HI>Bede</HI>) <HI>even to a Proverb,</HI> That he died praying; <HI>for when the Enemy had surrounded him, and he saw himself about to be slain, he prayed unto the LORD for the Souls of his Army. Hence it is that the Proverb comes,</HI> LORD, have Mercy upon the Soul, as St. <HI>Oswald</HI> said when he fell to the Earth. <HI>Which Proverb, in all Probability, hath been the Original of this present National Saying,</HI> <Q><L>When the Bell begins to toll,</L><L>LORD, have Mercy on the Soul.</L></Q></NOTE> <HI>Servant.</HI> It will not be long, till thou thy self shalt have Occasion for such Prayers, till thou come to die, and en∣ter on thy Journey to the other State: If then <HI>thou hast been merciful, thou shalt obtain Mercy;</HI> if by thy Prayers thou hast assisted the Souls of thy Brethren, thou shalt either be remembred in the Prayers of good Men, or surely these thy Prayers for others will be of Service to thy self also, at that dreadful Hour.</P>
<P>BUT now it may be objected, That as the Bell is seldom tolled till after the Person's De∣parture, it is to no Purpose to pray for the Soul; nay to pray for it, would be praying for the Dead: And since that is repugnant to the Do∣ctrine
<PB N="10" REF="29"/>
of our Church, our Prayers at that Time had much better be omitted.</P>
<P>INDEED it is too true, this Custom is not so common as it should be; but however, it is so much observed, as will be able to vindicate the putting up of constant Prayers. I know se∣veral Religious Families in this Place, and I hope it is so in other Places too, who always observe it, whenever the melancholly Season offers; and therefore it will at least sometimes happen, when we put up our Prayers constantly at the Tolling of the Bell, that we shall pray for a Soul departing.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. II.</HI> Of Watching with the Dead.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">W</SEG>ATCHING with the Corps was an ancient Custom of the Church, and every where pra∣ctised. They were wont to sit by it, from the Time of its Death till its Exportation to the Grave, either in the House it died in, or in the Church it self. Agreeable to this, we read in St. <HI>Austin,</HI> That as they watched his Mother <HI>Monica,</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Psalterium arripuit <HI>Euodius,</HI> &amp; cantare caepit psalmum, cui respondebamus omnes domus: Miserecordiam &amp; judi∣cium cantabo tibi Domine. <HI>Aug.

C.</HI> 12.</NOTE> <HI>Euodius</HI> took the <HI>Psalter,</HI> and began to sing a <HI>Psalm,</HI> which the whole Family answered with that of the Psalmist <HI>David, I will sing of Mercy and

Judgment, unto thee, O LORD, will I sing.</HI> And we are told, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ad ecclesiam antelucana hora qua defunctus est, cor∣pus ipsius portatum est: ibique eadem fuit nocte, quam vigilavimus in pascha. <HI>Greg. Turon. de Gloria, Confes. C.</HI> 104.</NOTE> That at the Death of St. <HI>Ambrose,</HI> his Body was carried into the Church before Day, the same Hour he died. It was the Night before <HI>Easter,</HI> and they watched with him there.</P>
<P>HOW unlike to this ancient Custom of Watch∣ing is the modern one, of locking up the Corps in a Room, and leaving it there alone? How un∣like to this decent Manner of Watching, is that Watching of the Vulgar, which is a Scene of Sport and Drinking and Lewdness? Watching at that Time with a dear Friend, is the last Kindness and Respect we can shew him; and how unfriendly is it, to change it into Negli∣gence and too great Resignation? How unchri∣stian, instead of a becoming Sorrow and decent Gravity, to put on an unbecoming Joy and un∣decent Pastime.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. III.</HI> Of following the Corps to the Grave, what it is an Emblem of: Of carry∣ing Greens in our Hand, what it sig∣nifies, what Use it may be of: Of Psalmody, its Antiquity, the Advan∣tage and Use of it.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>T hath been observed among all Nations, both in the Heathen and the Christian World, as a becoming and profitable Cere∣mony, to follow the Corps to the Grave. The Heathens observed it, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Praecedenti pompa funebri, vivi sequuntur, tanquam handmulto post morituri. <HI>Al. ab. Alex.

out, and laid down in the Grave. The going of the Corps before, shewed that their Friend was gone before them to the State of Death; and their following after, was as much as to say, that they must also in a short Time fol∣low him thither. For this Reason the Christian also observes the Custom, and may, if he plea∣ses, as he follows the Body to the Grave, en∣tertain himself with a pious Meditation upon it, in such like Thoughts as these of the Psalmist. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Psal. xc.—</NOTE> <HI>Thou art GOD from Everlasting, and World without End; Thou turnest Man to Destruction; again, Thou sayest, Come again ye Children of Men. For a thousand Years in thy Sight are but as Yesterday, seeing that is past as a Watch in the Night. As soon as thou scatterest them, they are even as a Sleep, and fade away suddenly like the Grass. In the Morning it is green and grow∣eth up, but in the Evening it is cut down, dried up and withered. Do thou therefore, O LORD,</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Psal. xxxix.</NOTE> <HI>let me know my End, and the Number of my Days, that I may be certified how long I have to live. Behold thou hast made my Days, as it
<PB N="19" REF="38"/>
were a Span long, and mine Age is nothing in re∣spect of Thee; and verily every Man living is al∣together Vanity. And now, LORD, what is my Hope? Truly my Hope is even in Thee. Deliver me from all mine Offences, and O spare me a little that I may recover my Strength, before I go hence and be no more seen.</HI> Such Thoughts as these of our Friend's, and of our own Mortality, would excite us to prepare for our own Change.</P>
<P>AND as this Form of Procession is an Em∣blem of our dying shortly after our Friend, so the carrying of Ivy, or Laurel, or Rosemary, or some of those Ever-Greens, is an Emblem of the Soul's Immortality. It is as much as to say, That tho' the Body be dead, yet the Soul is Ever-Green and always in Life: It is not like the Body, and those other Greens which die and revive again at their proper Seasons, no <HI>Autumn</HI> nor <HI>Winter</HI> can make a Change in it, but it is unalterably the same, perpetually in Life, and never dying.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Romans,</HI> and other Heathens upon this Occasion, made Use of Cypress, which being
<PB N="20" REF="39"/>
once cut, will never flourish nor grow any more, as an Emblem of their dying for ever, and be∣ing no more in Life. But instead of that, the ancient Christians used the Things before men∣tioned; they <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hadera quoque vel laurus &amp; hujusmodi, quae semper servant virorem, in sarchophago corpori substernuntur, ad significandum quod qui moriuntur in Christo, vivere nec desinunt.

Mort.</HI></NOTE> laid them under the Corps in the Grave, to signifie, that they who die in CHRIST, do not cease to live. For tho', as to the Body they die to the World; yet, as to their Souls, they live to GOD.</P>
<P>AND as the carrying of these Ever-Greens is an Emblem of the Soul's Immortality, so it is also of the Resurrection of the Body: For as these Herbs are not entirely pluck'd up, but only cut down, and will, at the returning Season, revive and spring up again; so the Bo∣dy, like them, is but cut down for a while, and will rise and shoot up again at the Resurrection. For, as the Prophet <HI>Isaiah</HI> says, <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. lxiii. 14.</NOTE> <HI>Our Bones shall flourish like an Herb.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="40"/>IT was customary <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Greg. C. 26.—</NOTE> among the ancient <HI>Jews,</HI> as they returned from the Grave, to pluck up the Grass two or three Times, and then throw it behind them, saying these Words of the Psal∣mist, <HI>They shall flourish out of the City like Grass upon the Earth:</HI> Which they did, to shew, that the Body, tho' dead, should spring up again as the Grass. Thus by these two ancient Cere∣monies, we have placed before our Eyes, our Mortality and Immortality; the one speaks the Death of the Body, the other the Life of the Soul, nay, and the Life of the Body too; for like that Herb we carry, it is not quite pluck'd up, but shall one Day be alive again. When it hath laid in the Earth the <HI>Winter</HI> Season, the Continuance of this World, and the Warmth and Influence of the <HI>Spring</HI> is come, the joyful Spring of the Resurrection, it shall be enliven'd, and shoot up, and eternally flourish. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Greg.

<P><PB N="22" REF="41"/>THERE is another Custom used in some Places, at the Procession of Funerals, which pays a due Honour to the Dead, and gives Com∣fort and Consolation to the Living; and that is, the carrying out the Dead with Psalmody. This was an ancient Custom of the Church. For in some of the earliest Ages, they carried out their Dead to the Grave with singing of Psalms and Hymns. Thus <HI>Socrates</HI> tells us, That when the Body of <HI>Babylas</HI> the Martyr was removed by the Order of <HI>Julian</HI> the Apostate, the Chri∣stians <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hoi kata, <HI>&amp;c. Soc. Lib.</HI> 3. <HI>C.</HI> 17.—</NOTE> with their Women and Children, rejoy∣ced and sung Psalms all the Way, as they bore the Corps from <HI>Dauphne</HI> to <HI>Antioch:</HI> Thus was <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Epitaphlum <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Hierom. Ep.</HI> 27.—</NOTE> <HI>Paula</HI> buried at <HI>Bethlehem;</HI> thus did St. <HI>An∣thony</HI> bury <HI>Paul</HI> the Hermite; and thus were the Generality of Men buried after the three first Centuries, when Persecution ceased. In Imitation of this, it is still customary in seve∣ral Parts of this Nation, to carry out the Dead with singing of Psalms and Hymns of Triumph; to shew that they have ended their spiritual War∣fare, that they have finished their Course with<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Ibid. <HI>in Vit.</HI> Paul.</NOTE>
<PB N="23" REF="42"/>
Joy, and are become Conquerors; which sure∣ly is a Matter of no little Consolation for the loosing of our Friend. And how becoming is it to pay such Honour to the Body! How is it imitating the blessed Angels, who rejoyced at Meeting of the Soul, and carrying it to Hea∣ven. For as they rejoyce <HI>at her Conversion on Earth,</HI> so most certainly they rejoyce at her go∣ing to Heaven. And as they rejoyce at the car∣rying of the Soul thither, so we, in Imitation of them, at the carrying out the Body to the Grave. They rejoyce that the Soul hath got out of a World of Sin, we that the Body out of a World of Trouble; they that the Soul can sin no more, we that the Body can no more suf∣fer; they that the Soul enjoys Glory and Hap∣piness, we that the Body rests from its Labours.</P>
<P>WHEN therefore we attend the Corps of a Neighbour or Relation, and this decent Cere∣mony is perform'd, let it also have a Share of our Thoughts, and excite in us Joy and Com∣fort, and Thanksgiving and Praise. And when these Customs are so observed, they will be of great Advantage to us, making us still fitter
<PB N="24" REF="43"/>
for the Heavenly Life. And surely a Thing of this Good and Profit, is much to be preferr'd to what hath in it nothing but Undecency and Irreverence; such is our laughing and jesting, and telling of News, when we accompany a Neighbour to the Grave. There is indeed a Mean to be observed, as in all other Things, so in this; we must neither be too sad, nor too merry; we must not be so merry as to throw off all the Signs of Affection and Love, all the Tokens of Esteem and Humanity; nor must we <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Thess. i. 4, 13.—</NOTE> <HI>sorrow even as others, which have no Hope. But we must</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Jam. v. 15.</NOTE> <HI>be so merry as to be able to sing Psalms, and so afflicted as to be excited to pray.</HI></P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. IV.</HI> Of Garlands in Country Churches: Of strawing Flowers on the Grave; the Antiquity of these Customs, the Inno∣cency of them.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>N some Country Churches 'tis cu∣stomary, to hang <HI>a Garland of Flowers</HI> over the Seats of <HI>deceased Virgins,</HI> as a Token of Esteem and Love, and an Emblem of their Reward in the Heavenly Church.</P>
<P>THIS Custom perhaps may be look'd upon, as sprung from that ancient Custom of the Hea∣thens, of <HI>crowning</HI> their <HI>Corps</HI> with <HI>Garlands</HI> in Token of Victory. But Mr. <HI>Bingham</HI> tells us, That we find not this Custom used by the <HI>Ancients</HI> in their <HI>Funeral-Rites.</HI> For as he ob∣serves,
<PB N="26" REF="45"/>
the Heathen in <HI>Minutius,</HI> makes it one Topick of Accusation against them, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Min. P.</HI> 35. Coronas etiam sepulchris denegatis, <HI>Bing. Vol.</HI> 10. <HI>P.</HI> 68.</NOTE> That they did not crown their Sepulchres.</P>
<P>BUT if they did not crown them after the Manner of the Heathens, they had a Custom of using Crowns of Flowers, if we may believe <HI>Cassalion,</HI> who tells us, <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Fuit quoque mos ad capita virginum apponendi flo∣rum coronas, <HI>&amp;c. Cass. de Vet. Sacr. Christ. P.</HI> 334.</NOTE> It was a Custom of the ancient Christians to place Crowns of Flow∣ers, at the Heads of deceased Virgins; for which he quotes <HI>Damascen, Gregory Nyssen,</HI> St. <HI>Jerom</HI> and St. <HI>Austin.</HI> And this hath probably been the Original of this Custom among the Vulgar.</P>
<P>THAT other Custom of <HI>strawing Flowers</HI> upon the <HI>Graves</HI> of their departed Friends, is also derived from a Custom of the ancient Church. For it was usual in those Times for the common Sort of People, to straw the Graves of their Friends, with various Flowers. Of this there are two notable Instances taken No∣tice of by <HI>Cassalion,</HI> and several other Ritualists.
<PB N="27" REF="46"/>
The one is that of St. <HI>Ambrose,</HI> in his <HI>Funeral Oration</HI> on the Death of <HI>Valentinian,</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Nec ego floribus tumulum ejus aspergam, sed spiri∣tum ejus Christi odore perfundam; spargant alii plenis li∣lia calathis: Nobis lilium est Christus: Hoc reliquias ejus sacrabo. <HI>Ambros. Orat. Funebri. de obitu Valentin.</HI></NOTE> <HI>I will not sprinkle his Grave with Flowers, but pour on his Spirit the Odour of CHRIST. Let others scatter Baskets of Flowers: CHRIST is our Lilly, and with this will I consecrate his Relicks.</HI></P>
<P>THE other is that of St. <HI>Jerom,</HI> in his E∣pistle to <HI>Pammachius</HI> upon the Death of his Wife. <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Caeteri mariti super tumulos conjugum spargunt vio∣las, rosas, lilia, floresque purpureos, &amp; dolorem pectoris his officiis consolantur; <HI>Pammachius</HI> noster sanctam favil∣lam ossaque veneranda eleemosynae balsamis rigat. <HI>Hieron. Epist. ad Pammachium de obitu Uxoris.</HI></NOTE> Whilst other Husbands strawed Vio∣lets, and Roses, and Lillies, and purple Flow∣ers, upon the Graves of their Wives, and com∣forted themselves with such like Offices, <HI>Pam∣machius</HI> bedew'd her Ashes and venerable Bones, with the Balsom of Alms.</P>
<P>NOW these Instances, tho' they justly com∣mend these other Actions, and wisely prefer them to the Ceremonies of adorning Graves with
<PB N="28" REF="47"/>
Flowers: Yet they no Way decry these ancient Customs. These lower Marks of Esteem and Honour, which the <HI>Vulgar</HI> paid to the Remains of their Friends, were in themselves harmless and innocent, and had no Censure; and as they were so, so should the present Customs be with∣out any, being full as harmless and innocent as the other.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. V.</HI> Of Bowing towards the Altar at the first coming into the Church; a Custom ge∣nerally observed by ignorant People; its Meaning and Antiquity.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">W</SEG>E may observe the Generality of old People among the Com∣monalty, as they enter into the Church, to turn their Fa∣ces towards the <HI>Altar,</HI> and bow or kneel that Way. This, no Doubt, is the Remains of that ancient Custom of the Church, of worshipping toward the East. For in the an∣cient Church they worshipped that Way upon several Accounts. <HI>First,</HI> That by so worship∣ping, they might lift up their Minds to GOD, who is called the Light and the Creator of
<PB N="30" REF="49"/>
Light. And therefore St. <HI>Austin</HI> says, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cum ad orationem stamus, ad orientem covertimur, unde caelum surgit, &amp;c. Ut admoneatur animus ad natu∣ram excellentiorem se convertere, id est, ad Dominum. <HI>Aug. de Serm. Domini. in Mont. Lib.</HI> 2. <HI>Cap.</HI> 5.</NOTE> When we pray standing, we turn our Faces to the East, from whence the Day springs, that we might be reminded of turning to a more excellent Nature, namely, The LORD. <HI>Secondly,</HI> That foras∣much as Man was driven out of <HI>Paradise,</HI> which is towards the East, he ought to look that Way, which is an Emblem of his Desire to return thither. St. <HI>Damascen</HI> therefore tells us, That <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>St.</HI> Damasc. Lib. <HI>4.</HI> C. <HI>13.</HI> Orthod. Fid.</NOTE> because the Scripture says, That GOD plan∣ted <HI>Paradise</HI> in <HI>Eden</HI> towards the East, where he <HI>placed the Man which he had formed,</HI> whom he punish'd with Banishment upon his Transgres∣sion, and made him dwell over against <HI>Paradise,</HI> in the Western Part; we therefore pray, <HI>(says he)</HI> being in Quest of our ancient Country; and as it were <HI>panting</HI> after it, do worship GOD that Way. <HI>Thirdly,</HI> It was used when any were baptized. They first turn'd their Faces to the West, and so renounc'd the Devil; and then to the East, and made their Covenant with CHRIST. <HI>Last∣ly,</HI>
<PB N="31" REF="50"/>
They prayed that Way, believing that our SAVIOUR would come to Judgment from that Quarter of the Heavens. <HI>For as the Lightning cometh out of the East, and shineth unto the West, so shall the Coming of the Son of Man be; and he is to come in like Manner as he ascended.</HI> And that he ascended up Eastward from Mount <HI>Oli∣vet,</HI> St. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Damasc. Lib. <HI>4.</HI> C. <HI>13.</HI> Orthod. Fid.</NOTE> <HI>Damascen</HI> assures us. For <HI>(says he)</HI> when he ascended into Heaven, he was taken up Eastward, and his Disciples worshipped him that Way. And therefore chiefly it was, that in the ancient Church they prayed with their Faces to the East; and that many of our own Church at this Day, turn their Faces to that Quarter of the World, at the Repetition of the Creed.</P>
<P>WHAT may more confirm this, and speak it to have been the universal Opinion of the Church, is the ancient Custom of burying the Corps, with the Feet to the East, and the Head to the West; which Custom is continued to this Day in the whole Church of <HI>England:</HI> This was observed for the same Reason, That, at the Coming of CHRIST to Judgment from
<PB N="32" REF="51"/>
the oriental Part of Heaven, our Bodies might be found in a praying Posture, with their Faces towards the East.</P>
<P>OUR learned Countryman <HI>Gregory</HI> tells us, <Q>That the holy Men of <HI>Jerusalem</HI> hold a Tra∣dition generally received from their Ancients, that our SAVIOUR himself was buried, with his Face and Feet towards the East. It is affirmed by the Geographers of the holy Land.</Q> And <HI>Bede</HI> says, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Introeuntes ab oriente in domum illam rotundam quae in petra excisa est, viderunt angelum sedentem ad meri∣dianam partem loci illius, ubi positum fuerat corpus Jesu; hoc enim erat in dextris, quod nimirum, corpus, quod supinum jacens caput habebat ad occasum, dexteram ne∣cesse est habere ad austrum. <HI>Bed. in Dic. Sanct. Paschae, Tom.</HI> 7.</NOTE> That as the Holy Women enter'd at the Eastern Part into the Round-House, which is hewn out in the Rock, they saw the Angel sitting at the South Part of the Place, where the Body of JESUS had lain, that is, at his Right Hand; for undoubtedly his Body having its Face up∣wards and its Head to the West, must have its Right Hand to the South. <HI>Cassalion</HI> says,
<PB N="33" REF="52"/>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Adeo tenaces fuere prisci illi fideles in hoc ritu respici∣endi in orientem, ut non folum ipsi viventes, hoc in eo∣rum precibus exacte servarent, verum etiam mortui eorum corpora supina in sepulchris facie orientem respicerent. <HI>Cass. de Vet.

P.</HI> 30.</NOTE> The Faithful of old were so observing of this Ceremony of looking towards the East, that they not only strictly observed it in their Pray∣ers when living; but even when they were dead, their Bodies were placed with their Fa∣ces upwards in the Sepulchre, looking towards the East.</P>
<P>THE learned Dr. <HI>Comber</HI> in his Discourse of the solemn Interment, hath these Words upon "this Subject, <Q>We may note the Positure and Position of the Corps, which among the Chri∣stians hath always been to turn the Feet to the East, with the Head to the West; that so they may be ready to meet the LORD, whom the Ancients did believe should appear in the oriental Part of Heaven. <HI>Durand. Rat. Lib.</HI> 7. <HI>Cap.</HI> 33. Or as our ingenious Mr. <HI>Gre∣gory</HI> believes, That they might be in the Po∣sture of Prayer, with their Faces to the East, as soon as they were raised. There are some
<PB N="34" REF="53"/>
ancient Authors tell us, That the old Inha∣bitants of <HI>Attica</HI> buried thus before the Days of <HI>Solon,</HI> who, as they report, convinced the <HI>Athenians,</HI> that the Island of <HI>Salamis</HI> did of Right belong to them, by shewing them dead Bodies looking that Way, and Sepulchres tur∣ned towards the East, as they use to bury. <HI>Diog. Laert. Vit. Solon,</HI> &amp;c. And the Scho∣liast upon <HI>Thucidides</HI> says, It was the Man∣ner of all the <HI>Greeks</HI> to bury their Dead thus: Tho' a learned modern Writer supposes these Authors mistaken, and cites <HI>Plutarch</HI> and <HI>Elian</HI> to prove, that the <HI>Athenians</HI> turned their Dead towards the West. However it is certain, that all Nations had one certain Way of placing the Corps, from which they would not vary; and we Christians have so great Antiquity for our Custom, that we ought not out of Singularity to alter it.</Q></P>
<P>NO Doubt but this learned Man had great Reason for this Conclusion, as well knowing that this ancient Rite, was struck at by the whole Herd of Sectaries, as a silly Fancy and an idle Dream: Who never would observe it,
<PB N="35" REF="54"/>
were it not that they are sometimes obliged; but would with those who are not obliged, act the very Reverse, and bury North and South. I wish there were no powerfuller Enemies to it, than them now a Days; but, <HI>as a Man's Ene∣mies are too often those of his own Houshold;</HI> so, 'tis to be lamented, that some who pretend to be of our own Church, are upon all Occasions secret Advocates against this Ceremony. When therefore there is such Opposition without, and such Treachery within, 'tis high Time to be on the Guard against our Enemies; least a Cere∣mony so venerable for its Antiquity, and so use∣ful in its Observation, be laid aside: Was it but for this one Thing, that it speaks the Hope of the whole Christian Church, since the ear∣liest Times of Christianity, about the Resur∣rection of the same Body. It is too true, that there are some at this Time of the Day, as well as were in the Days of the Apostle, who think <HI>it a Thing incredible that GOD should raise the Dead;</HI> some really disbelieving the Resurrection of any Body, and others that of the same Body. But as long as this Ceremony is in Being, it will always be a ready Proof, that the whole
<PB N="36" REF="55"/>
Christian Church, did not only believe the Re∣surrection of the Body, but of that very Body, which was laid down in the Grave. For they observed it, that they might be ready with their Faces to meet their SAVIOUR at his coming to Judgment, which certainly implies that they believed that very Body should rise again.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>T is a received Tradition among the Vulgar, That at the Time of Cock-crowing, the Midnight Spirits forsake these lower Re∣gions, and go to their proper Places. They wander, say they, about the World, from the dead Hour of Night, when all Things are buried in Sleep and Darkness, till the Time of Cock-crowing, and then they
<PB N="38" REF="57"/>
depart. Hence it is, that in Country-Places, where the Way of Life requires more early La∣bour, they always go chearfully to Work at that Time; whereas if they are called abroad sooner, they are apt to imagine every Thing they see or hear, to be a wandring Ghost. <HI>Shakespear</HI> hath given us an excellent Account of this vulgar Notion, in his Tragedy of <HI>Hamlet.</HI></P>

<L>And then it started like a guilty Thing</L>
<L>Upon a dreadful Summons. I have heard,</L>
<L>The Cock that is the Trumpet to the Day,</L>
<L>Doth with his lofty and shrill sounding Throat</L>
<L>Awake the God of Day: And at his Warning</L>
<L>Whether in Sea, or Fire, in Earth or Air,</L>
<L>The extravagant and erring Spirit hyes</L>
<L>To its Confine, and of the Truth herein,</L>
<L>This present Object made Probation.</L>

<L>Some say that e'er against that Season comes,</L>
<L>Wherein our Saviour's Birth is celebrated,</L>
<L>The Bird of Dawning singeth all Night long.</L>
<L>And then, they say, No Spirit doth walk abroad,</L>
<L>The Nights are wholsome, then no Planet strikes,</L>
<L>No Fairy takes, no Witch hath Power to harm,</L>
<L>So gracious and so hallowed is that Time.</L>
</SP>
<P><PB N="39" REF="58"/>NOW to shew what Truth there is in this vulgar Opinion, I shall consider, <HI>First,</HI> What Truth there is in the Roaming of Spirits in the Night. And, <HI>Secondly,</HI> Whether they are obli∣ged to go away at Cock-crow.</P>
<P>I believe none who assent to the Truth of Divine Revelation, deny that there are good and evil Angels attending upon Men; the one to guard and protect them, and the other to harm and work their Ruin; that the one are <HI>those</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Heb. i. 14.—</NOTE> <HI>ministring Spirits, which are sent out to minister to the Heirs of Salvation;</HI> the other the <HI>roaring Lion,</HI> and his Instruments, <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Job ii. 2.—</NOTE> <HI>who wander to and fro in the Earth; these</HI> <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Mat. xii. 43.</NOTE> <HI>unclean Spirits who wander through dry Places, seeking Rest and finding none.</HI></P>
<P>NOR, I believe, will it be question'd, that there have been Apparitions of good and evil Spirits, and that many, with our SAVIOUR'S Disciples, have been <HI>affrighted and cried out,</HI> not only with supposing they had seen, but really with seeing a Spirit. Of this the Testi∣mony
<PB N="40" REF="59"/>
of all Ages, and Scripture it self are a sufficient Demonstration.</P>
<P>WHAT then could these have ordinarily been, but the Appearances of some of those <HI>Angels of Light,</HI> or Darkness? For I am far from thinking that either the Ghosts of the Damn'd or the Happy, either the Soul of a <HI>Di∣ves</HI> or a <HI>Lazarus,</HI> returns here any more. For as St. <HI>Athanasius</HI> observes, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hai <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n tois n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ois, &amp;c Athan. <HI>Tom. 2. P. 34.</HI></NOTE> <HI>These Visions and Shades of the Saints, which appear in the Tem∣ples and at the Tombs, are not the Souls of the Saints themselves, but the good Angels appearing in their Shapes.</HI> Not that GOD could not re∣mand the Ghost of <HI>Samuel,</HI> and order it again to visit the Earth, as he made <HI>Moses</HI> and <HI>Elias</HI> to appear at our SAVIOUR'S Transfiguration; but that a Thing of this Nature was very un∣common, and seldom happen'd.</P>
<P>TAKING it therefore for granted, that there have been Apparitions of Angels, I believe it will also be owned, that these Apparitions have frequently happen'd in the Night. And truly,
<PB N="41" REF="60"/>
was there no direct Proof of this, yet the No∣tion of their appearing in the Night, being as it were link'd and chained to our Idea of an Ap∣parition, would almost perswade us, that the Night is the most proper Time for such Appea∣rances. Whether it is, that the Fables of Nur∣ses, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Lock,</HI> Human Underst.</NOTE> as an ingenious Author imagines, <Q>have so associated the Idea of Spirit to the Night, that the one never appears without the other;</Q> or whether there is something in the Presence of Night, some Awfulness and Horrour, which naturally dispose the Mind of Man to these Reflections. I am indeed very inclinable to be∣lieve, that these Legendary Stories of Nurses and old Women, are the Occasion of much greater Fears, than People without them, would generally have of these Things; but I cannot help thinking, that the Presence of Night, would naturally lead a Man to some Reflection of Spirits, without any such Cause as that learned Author mentions. There are some particular Times, which will naturally raise some parti∣cular Thoughts: Thus on a bright sunny Day
<PB N="42" REF="61"/>
we are naturally disposed to Mirth and Gaiety; when the Day over-casts, or the Weather is hazy, we then turn indolent and dull, and sooth our selves in Melancholly; if it Thunder and Lighten, we think of the Day of Judg∣ment and sudden Death: And thus also the Night, as it inclines us to grave and serious Thoughts, raises in us Horrour and Dismay, and makes us afraid, even when our Judgment tells us there is no Fear; so it may of it self be look'd upon as a natural Cause of such Reflections.</P>
<P>BUT however this be, we must necessarily own, that Spirits have frequently appeared in the Night, or we must give the Lye to the Traditions of all Ages, to Historians prophane and sacred, and the wisest and best in the Ge∣nerations of Men.</P>
<P>IN the Heathen World there are many In∣stances, of which I shall only mention this one out of <HI>Plutarch:</HI> <Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In Vit. Mar. <HI>Brut.</HI> Trans. Duke.</NOTE>One Night, before <HI>Brutus</HI> passed out of <HI>Asia,</HI> he was very late all alone in his Tent, with a dim Light burning by
<PB N="43" REF="62"/>
him, all the Rest of the Army being husht and silent; and musing with himself, and very thoughtful, as he turn'd his Eye to the Door, he saw a strange and terrible Appearance, of a prodigious and frightful Body coming towards him without speaking. <HI>Brutus</HI> boldly asked him, What art thou? Man, or God? Or upon what Business do'st thou come to us? The Spi∣rit answer'd, I am thy <HI>Evil Genius,</HI> thou shalt see me at <HI>Philippi;</HI> to which <HI>Brutus</HI> not at all disturbed, reply'd, Then I will see thee there.</Q></P>
<P>IN the sacred Writings we have <HI>Job</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Job—</NOTE> <HI>terri∣fied with Visions of the Night,</HI> when deep Sleep falleth upon Men, Fear came upon him and Trembling, which made all his Bones to shake; then a Spirit passed by before his Face, and the Hair of his Flesh stood up. In the Night <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Gen. xxxii.—</NOTE> <HI>Jacob</HI> wrestled with the Angel; in the Night an Angel delivered <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Acts xii.</NOTE> <HI>Peter</HI> out of Prison, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>BUT tho' it be true from Scripture, that there have been nightly Apparitions, yet these
<PB N="44" REF="63"/>
are chiefly of good Angels; whereas this Opi∣nion principally means, the Appearances of evil Spirits. It must be owned indeed, that the Appearances of evil Spirits, if litterally, are yet but very seldom mention'd in the Night in Scripture; but however, that they wander and appear at Night, is very deducible from, if not litterally mentioned in it. Their's <HI>is the Land of Darkness, and the Shadow of Death: They are reserved under Chains of Dark∣ness to the Judgment of the great Day; and we know that every one that doth Evil natu∣rally hateth the Light: They therefore love Darkness rather than Light, because their Deeds are Evil.</HI> The Night therefore, in a more e∣special Manner, seems to be their <HI>Hour,</HI> and the <HI>Power of Darkness.</HI></P>
<P>THIS was the Opinion of the <HI>Jews,</HI> as may be learned from the Fear of the Apostles, when they saw our Saviour about the fourth Watch of the Night, coming to them upon the Waters: <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mat. xiv. 25.</NOTE> <HI>They were affrighted and cryed out, supposing
<PB N="45" REF="64"/>
they had seen a Spirit.</HI> Doctor <HI>Whitby</HI> upon this Place, says, <Q>That the <HI>Jews</HI> had then an Opinion of hurtful Spirits walking in the Night, is evident from the seventy, who ren∣der'd,</Q> <HI>from the Pestilence walking in Dark∣ness;</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Apo pragmatos diaporeuomenou en skotei.</NOTE> <HI>From</HI> the Fear of the Devils that walk in the Night.</P>
<P>AND that this was also the Opinion of the ancient Christians, is evident, not only from their dividing the Night into four Watches, the Evening, Midnight, Cock-crowing, and the Morning; which were the Military Divisions of the Night, and which <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Si quidem &amp; in Nocte Stationes, &amp; Vigiliae Militares in quatuor partes divisae ternis horarum spatiis secernun∣tur. <HI>Isidore,</HI> Lib. 1. de Eccle. Offici. Cap. 19.</NOTE> they observed to guard their Souls from the silent Incursions of evil Spirits, as the others did those of the Enemy; but also from their many Relations of such Ap∣pearances. <HI>Cassian</HI> in giving an Account of the Watching of the Ancient Monks, and their be∣ing assaulted with Midnight Spirits, tells us, That at the Beginning of the Monkish Life,
<PB N="46" REF="65"/>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tanta nam{que} erat eorum feritas, ut vix pauci— Tolerare habitationem solitudinis possent.—Ita eorum atrocitas grassabatur, &amp; frequentes ac visibiles sentiebantur aggressus, ut non auderent omnes pariter noctibus obdormi∣re, sed vicissim aliis degustantibus somnum, alii vigilias cele∣brantes, Psalmis &amp; Orationibus, seu Lectionibus in haere∣bant. <HI>Cassian.</HI> Coll. 7. Cap. 23.</NOTE> the Rage of the Midnight Spirits was so great, that but few, and these too Men of Age and unshaken Resolution, were able to endure the Life in the Desart. For such was their Fierceness, that where Eight or Ten had been together in a Monastery, they would have made frequent and visible Incursions: Insomuch, that they never all slept at the same Time, but took it by turns; some watching the Rest, and ex∣ercising themselves in singing Psalms, in Pray∣ing and Reading. And St. <HI>Athanasius</HI> in his Life of <HI>Anthony</HI> the Hermit, tells, Of many Conflicts that good Man had in the Night with the Powers of Darkness, whilst they endeavour∣ed to batter him <HI>from the strong Holds</HI> of his Faith. And what can our Church chiefly mean in <HI>the Collect for Aid against Perils;</HI> but that GOD would send us Protection from all the Spirits of Darkness, these Midnight Wanderers
<PB N="47" REF="66"/>
of the World: And for this Reason, every good Man, when he lies down to sleep at Night, desires the great <HI>Keeper of</HI> Israel, <HI>who never slumbereth nor sleepeth, to send his Holy Angels to pitch their Tents round about him,</HI> and banish from him the Spirits of the Night.</P>
<P>SO far then this Tradition is just and good, that there are Midnight Spirits who wander a∣bout the World, going <HI>too and fro in the Earth, seeking whom they may devour.</HI> Let us now in the next Place enquire, what Truth there is in the other Part of it; namely, That they always fly away at Cock-crow.</P>
<P>THIS Opinion, whatever Truth there may be in it, is certainly very Ancient. We have it mentioned by the Christian Poet <HI>Prudentius,</HI> who flourished in the Beginning of the fourth Century, as a Tradition of Common Belief: His Words are these,
<Q><LG>
<L><HI>Ferunt Vagantes Daemones</HI></L>
<L><HI>Laetos Tenebris Noctium,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Gallo canente exterritos,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Sparsim timere &amp; cedere.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="48" REF="67"/>
<L><HI>Invisa nam Vicinitas</HI></L>
<L><HI>Lucis, salutis, numinis,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Rupto Tenebrarum situ,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Noctis Fugat satellites,</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>Hoc esse signum praescii</HI></L>
<L><HI>Norunt repromissae spei,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Qua Nos soporis Liberi</HI></L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>They say the wandering Powers, that Love</L>
<L>The silent Darkness of the Night,</L>
<L>At Cock-crowing give o'er to rove,</L>
<L>And all in Fear do take their Flight.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The approaching salutary Morn,</L>
<L>The approach Divine of hated Day,</L>
<L>Makes Darkness to its Place return,</L>
<L>And drives the Midnight Ghosts away.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>They know that this an Emblem is,</L>
<L>Of what preceeds our lasting Bliss,</L>
<L>That Morn, when Graves give up their Dead,</L>
<L>In certain hope to meet their GOD.</L>
</LG></Q></P>
<P><HI>CASSIAN</HI> also, who lived in the same Cen∣tury, giving an Account of a Multitude of De∣vils
<PB N="49" REF="68"/>
who had been Abroad in the Night, says, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Aurora itaque superveniente, cum omnis haec ab ocu∣lis evanisset Daemonum multitudo. <HI>Cass.</HI> Coll. 8. C. 16.</NOTE> That as soon as the Morn approached, they all vanished and fled away. By this we see, that this was a current Opinion at this Time of Day; but what Reason they had for it, except some Relations of the disappearing of Evil Spirits at that Hour, I never yet have met with: But there have been produc'd at that Time of Night, Things of very memora∣ble Worth, which might perhaps raise the pious Credulity of some Men to imagine, that there was something more in it, than in other Times. It was about the Time of Cock-crow∣ing when our Saviour was born, and the An∣gels sung the first Christmas-Carol to the poor Shepherds, in the Fields of <HI>Bethlehem.</HI> Now it may be presum'd, that as the Saviour of the World was then born, and the <HI>Heavenly Host</HI> had then descended to proclaim▪ the News, that the Angels of Darkness would be terrified and confounded, and immediately fly away: And perhaps this Consideration has partly been the Foundation of this Opinion; for as this
<PB N="50" REF="69"/>
may easily be supposed, so perhaps it has been imagin'd, that the Spirits of Darkness, having always in Memory that fatal Hour, are start∣led and frighted away as the Cock proclaims it.</P>
<P>IT was also about this Time when he rose from the Dead. And when the great <HI>Sun of Righ∣teousness</HI> was risen upon the World, no wonder that all the Clouds of Darkness and Wickedness were dispell'd; no wonder that the conquer'd Powers of Hell were not able to shew their Heads: And this perhaps hath been another Reason of their imagining that Spirits go away at that time.</P>
<P>A third Reason is, that Passage in the Book of <HI>Genesis,</HI> where Jacob <HI>wrestled with the Angel for a Blessing;</HI> where the Angel says unto him, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gen. xxxii.</NOTE> <HI>Let me go, for the Day breaketh.</HI></P>
<P>BUT indeed this Tradition seems more, e∣specially to have risen from some particular Circumstances attending the Time of Cock-crowing; and which, as <HI>Prudentius</HI> seems to say above, are an Emblem of the Approach of
<PB N="51" REF="70"/>
the Day of the Resurrection. For when we leave the World, we lie down in our Graves, and <HI>Rest from our Labours;</HI> Sleep and Dark∣ness lay hold upon us, and there we abide till the last Day appear, when the Voice of the Arch-Angel shall awake us, that we may meet the LORD of Light and Day. And when we leave the common Business and Care of Life, we lie down in our Beds, as in a Grave, buried as it were in Sleep and Darkness, till the Cock crow, the welcome Messenger of the News of Day.</P>
<P>THE Circumstances therefore of the Time of Cock-crowing, being so natural a Figure and Representation of the Morning of the Resurre∣ction; the Night so shadowing out the Night of the Grave; the third Watch, being as some suppose, the Time our Saviour will come to Judgment at; the Noise of the <HI>Cock</HI> awaken∣ing sleepy Man, and telling him as it were, <HI>the Night is far spent, the Day is at Hand;</HI> re∣presenting so naturally the Voice of the Arch-Angel awakening the Dead, and calling up the Righteous to everlasting Day; so natural∣ly does the Time of Cock-crowing shadow out
<PB N="52" REF="71"/>
these Things, that probably some good well-meaning Men, have been brought to believe, that the very Devils themselves, when the Cock Crew, and reminded them of them, did fear and tremble, and shun the Light.</P>
<P>NOW in Answer to the first of these Con∣jectures: 'Tis very likely the Evil Spirits did fly away in the Morning of the Nativity, and because of our Saviour's Birth and that <HI>Com∣pany of the Heavenly Host,</HI> might be afraid and retire into thick Darkness; yet it will not hence follow, that it always happens so at the Time of Cock-crowing: For if they did fly away that Morning, the Circumstances of our Saviour's Birth, the heavenly Glory of the Angelick Quire, their Musick and their Presence were the Occasion of it: And why only the bare Remembrance of what happened at that Time, should always at the Time of Cock-crowing drive them away, rather than when they remem∣ber it at another, no Reason seems to be given.</P>
<P>AS to the second Conjecture, namely, That it was the Time of our Saviour's Rising from
<PB N="53" REF="72"/>
the Dead, I answer in the same Manner, That tho' it be allowed, that the Evil Spirits might have returned to the Land of Darkness, upon our Saviour's Rising from the Dead; yet why it should Occasion them always to do so at that Time, no Reason can be given.</P>
<P>AS to the third Conjecture, it is easy to observe, That this was a good Angel, where∣as they that shun the Light, are bad ones: This was the Angel of the Covenant, the Cre∣ator of Light, and the Lord of the Day: We may therefore as well imagine, that it was not in his Power, to get out of the Arms of <HI>Jacob,</HI> without saying, <HI>Let me go;</HI> as to suppose he was obliged to go, because he said <HI>the Day breaketh.</HI> The meaning of which Words, <Q>According to <HI>Willet,</HI> is not that the Angel was gone to the blessed Company of the Angels, to sing their Morning Hymn to GOD, as the <HI>Hebrews</HI> imagine: For the Angels, not only in the Morning, but at other Times, are exercised in praising GOD. But the Angel thus speaketh according to the Custom of Men, having now taken the
<PB N="54" REF="73"/>
Form and Shape of a Man, as tho' he had hast to other Business, and leaving <HI>Jacob</HI> al∣so to his Affairs.</Q></P>
<P>THE last Conjecture of the Rise of this Tra∣dition, seems to carry greater probability than the Others: For as these Things are a Repre∣sentation of the Circumstances of the Morning of the Resurrection, so they must sure enough bring that last Day into Remembrance; and they never can do so, but as surely they must create Terrour and Confusion in all the Devils and Ghosts of the Night: Whilst they assure them they shall never any more enjoy the Realms of Bliss, but be hurried into that <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matth. xxv. 41.</NOTE> <HI>e∣verlasting Fire, prepared for the Devil and his Angels.</HI> But that these Things are the Occa∣sion of their Flying away at the Approach of Day, is not to be supposed. On the contrary, the Devil and his Angels ramble o'er the World in Day-light, and are mid-day Devils, as well as mid-night ones: For the Devil is incessant in his Temptations, and therefore he is abroad in the Day as well as the Night, tho'
<PB N="55" REF="74"/>
perhaps has seldom appear'd but in Darkness. Thus St. <HI>Austin,</HI> in one of his Meditations, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Et ideo Deus meus ad te clamamus, libera nos ab ad∣versario nostro quotidiano, qui sive dormiamus, sive vigi∣lemus,—die ac nocte fraudibus &amp; artibus, nunc palam nunc occulte sagittas venenatas contra nos dirigens, ut in∣terficiat animas nostras. <HI>Aug. Sol. Cap.</HI> 16.</NOTE> We implore thee, O GOD! that thou woul∣dest deliver us from our daily Enemy, who by his Wiles and Cunning is always watching us, Day and Night, Sleeping and Waking; and both openly and in secret, shooting at us his poisoned Arrows, that he may destroy our Souls.</P>
<P>AND now, what, tho' this be true, as it most certainly seems to be so, that at the chearful Hour of Cock-crowing, the wander∣ing Ghosts are not driven away, but still continue going too and fro? What, tho' then their Power be still the same, and their In∣tentions as fully bent to do Evil? Consider but that GOD'S Care and Providence govern the World, and there will be found as much Safety for us, in the midst of Evil Spirits, as if they absented at that Time. The Al∣mighty Power of GOD, is the same then, as
<PB N="56" REF="75"/>
at other Times; nothing but that, preserved us continually, and that, will always be able to preserve us. However great may be the Malice of Devils; however desirous of work∣ing our Ruin; tho' they watch all Opportu∣nities, and are unwearied in tempting us; <HI>yet the loving Kindness of the LORD endureth for Ever, and his Mercy is over all his Works: He will not suffer our Foot to be moved; he that keepeth us will not sleep: We shall not be afraid of the Sun by Day, nor the Moon by Night: For the Pestilence that walketh in Darkness, nor for the Sickness that destroyeth in the Noon-day.</HI></P>
<P>ARE we then afraid of Darkness and the presence of Night? Let us remember the Cre∣ator of them, and have but Faith in him, and we shall find <HI>our Night turned into Day. In his Light shall we see Light:</HI> We shall be as secure as if there was no Darkness about us, as well knowing, that that GOD which pro∣tects us, sees through the thickest <HI>Mediums,</HI> and the darkest Night: <HI>For with him the Dark∣ness is no Darkness, but the Night is as clear as the Day; the Darkness and Light to him are
<PB N="57" REF="76"/>
both alike.</HI> Or are we afraid of that old Ser∣pent the Devil, that nightly Rambler of the World, who is a Lover of Night and Dark∣ness? Let us trust in GOD, and no harm shall happen to us. If we will but <HI>fear no Evil, his Rod and his Staff shall Comfort us, tho' we walk through the Valley of the Shadow of Death: For GOD hath reserved the Devil and his Angels in everlasting Chains, under Darkness, unto the Judgment of the great Day.</HI> Tho' therefore he is permitted to wan∣der the World, yet he is so chain'd up, that without GOD'S particular Order or Permis∣sion, he is not allowed to touch the Sons of Men; and he is so reserved and kept in Dark∣ness, that it is not in his Power even barely to appear and be visible to them, without the Permission of GOD: So little Reason hath e∣very good Man to fear the Spight and Malice of all the Devils in Hell.</P>
<P>WHEN then the Night pours out her Ter∣rours, covers all Things with Darkness, and strikes thee with Horrour; <HI>Lift but up thy Eyes to the Hills, from whence cometh thy Help,</HI>
<PB N="58" REF="77"/>
and thou shalt clearly see, that our <HI>Lord GOD is a Light and Defence to thee.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">—Quia filiis lucis &amp; in noctibus dies est.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VII.</HI> Of Church-Yards; why the Vulgar are generally afraid of passing through them at Night: The Original of this Fear: That there is nothing in them now, more than in other Places to be afraid of.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE most of ignorant People are afraid of going through a <HI>Church-Yard</HI> at Night-time. If they are obliged upon some hasty and urgent Affair, they fear and tremble, till they are beyond its Bounds, but they generally avoid it, and go further about. It would, no Question, be better if there were fewer <HI>Path-ways</HI> through Church-Yards than there are, both as it would prevent several <HI>Abuses</HI> committed in them, and also cause the Ashes of the Dead to be in
<PB N="60" REF="79"/>
greater quiet, and more undisturbed Peace: We should not then see Church-Yards changed into common Dunghils, nor should we tread so frequently upon the Bones of our Friends: But when for the Conveniency of Neighbour∣hood, or other Reasons, there are allowed pub∣lick Ways, it is a very great Weakness to be afraid of passing through them.</P>
<P>THE Reason of this Fear is, a Notion they have imbib'd, that in <HI>Church-Yards</HI> there is a frequent walking of Spirits at the <HI>Dead-time</HI> of Night. Indeed there is at that Time some∣thing awful and horrible every where, and it must be confess'd something more solemn in a <HI>Church-Yard,</HI> than in the Generality of other Places; but that it is then more frequented with <HI>Apparitions and Ghosts</HI> than other Places are, is at this Time of Day intirely ground∣less, and without any Reason.</P>
<P>THE Original of this Timorousness may be deduc'd from the Heathens: For they believ∣ed that the <HI>departed Ghosts</HI> came out of their <HI>Tombs</HI> and <HI>Sepulchres,</HI> and wander'd about the
<PB N="61" REF="80"/>
Place where the Body lay buried. Thus <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Maerin saepe animas imis excite sepulchris, —<HI>Vidi—Bucol.</HI> 8. <HI>Virg.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Virgil</HI> tells us, That <HI>Maeris</HI> could call the Ghosts out of their Sepulchres: And <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Nunc animae tennes.—Sepulchris.—Errant.— <HI>Ovid.

<P>IT having therefore been a current Opinion of the Heathens, that <HI>Places of Burial and Church-Yards</HI> were frequently haunted with <HI>Spectres</HI> and <HI>Apparitions,</HI> it is easy to imagine, that the Opinion has been handed from them, among the ignorant and unlearned, through∣out all the Ages of Christianity to the present Day. And indeed, tho' now there may be no such Things, yet that there have been, need not be disputed; not that they were the real Souls of Men departed: For I cannot see for

what Reason it should be supposed, <Q>(<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Scot.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VIII.</HI> Of visiting Wells and Fountains: The Original of this Custom: The naming of them of great Antiquity: The Wor∣ship paid them by the Papists, was gross Idolatry.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>N the dark Ages of <HI>Popery,</HI> it was a Custom, if any <HI>Well</HI> had an awful Situation, and was seated in some lonely melan∣cholly Vale; if its Water was clear and limpid, and beautifully <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">—Viridi si margine clauderet undas.— Herba.—<HI>Juven. Sat.</HI> 3.</NOTE> margin'd with the tender Grass; or if it was look'd upon, as having a Medicinal Quality; to gift it to some <HI>Saint,</HI> and honour it with his Name. Hence it is, that we have at
<PB N="66" REF="85"/>
this Day Wells and Fountains called, some St. <HI>John</HI>'s, St. <HI>Mary Magdalen</HI>'s, St. <HI>Mary</HI>'s <HI>Well,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>TO these kind of Wells, the common People are accustomed to go, on a Summer's Evening, to refresh themselves with a <HI>Walk</HI> after the Toil of the Day, to drink the Water of the Fountain, and enjoy the pleasing Prospect of Shade and Stream.</P>
<P>NOW this Custom (tho' at this Time of Day, very commendable, and harmless, and innocent) seems to be the Remains of that superstitious Practice of the Papists, of paying Adoration to Wells and Fountains: For they imagin'd there was some Holiness and Sancti∣ty in them, and so worshipped them. In the <HI>Canons</HI> of St. <HI>Anselm,</HI> made in the Year 1102, we find this Superstitious Practice in some Measure forbid. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Johnson</HI> Consti.

Mr. <HI>Johnson</HI> says upon this <HI>Canon,</HI> that the Worshipping of Wells and Fountains, was a Superstiti∣on, which prevailed in this Nation, till the Age before the Reformation: Nay, I cannot say, it is extinguish'd yet among the Papists. In the Ages of dark Popery it was thought sufficient to forbid the Honouring of Wells and Fountains, without the Bishop's Appro∣bation.</Q></P>
<P>THE giving of Names to Wells, is of great Antiquity: We find it a Custom in the Days of the old Patriarchs. <HI>Abraham</HI> observed this Custom; and therefore the Well, which he recover'd from the Servants of <HI>Abimeleck,</HI> He <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Gen. xxi. 31.</NOTE> called <HI>Beer-sheba,</HI> or the Well of the Oath,
<PB N="68" REF="87"/>
<HI>because there they sware both of them.</HI> Thus also <HI>Isaac,</HI> when his Herdsmen had found a Well, and the Herdsmen of <HI>Gerar</HI> had a Con∣test with them about the Right of it, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gen. 26.</NOTE> <HI>called the Name of the Well</HI> Eseck, that is, <HI>Strife: because they strove with him. And he digged another Well, and strove for that also, and he called the Name of it</HI> Sitnah, that is, <HI>Hatred. And he removed from thence, and digged ano∣ther Well, and for that they strove not; and he called the Name of it,</HI> Rehoboth, that is, <HI>Room. And he said for now the LORD hath made Room for us, and we shall be fruitful in the Land.</HI> And we read it was at <HI>Jacob</HI>'s <HI>Well</HI> where JESUS talked with the Woman of <HI>Sa∣maria.</HI> To give Names therefore to Wells, is of an ancient Standing; but to pay Homage and Worship to them, was never heard of a∣mong the People of GOD, till they sunk in∣to gross Idolatry, and became Worshippers of Stocks and Stones: <HI>When the Creature became worshipped instead of the Creator,</HI> then was this Custom first introduced, in the Ages of Popish Ignorance and Idolatry.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="88"/>THERE need be no Question, but as this Custom is practically Heathenish, so it is also originally: For the Heathens were wont to worship Streams and Fountains, and to sup∣pose that the Nymphs, whom they imagin'd the Goddesses of the Waters, presided over them. As the Papists have borrowed many of their silly and superstitious Ceremonies from the Religion of the Heathens, so this in par∣ticular, a sottish, stupid, and abominable Cu∣stom, they could borrow no where else. <HI>For we had no such Custom,</HI> neither at any Time <HI>the Churches of GOD.</HI></P>

<P>THIS is a Copy of the Omens of the Hea∣thens, <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Deinde anguribus &amp; reliqui reges usi: Et exactis regi∣bus, nihil publice fine auspiciis nec domi nec militiae gera∣batur. <HI>Cic. de Divin.

Hence it was that they consulted the Intrails of Beasts, the Flights of Birds, and several other Things: And that the very
<PB N="72" REF="91"/>
Things above-mentioned, as the Authori∣ties there declare, have been observed by them; yea, they have observ'd them, even in the remotest Ages, beyond the Days of the oldest Records. The Heathen World there∣fore was full of them, and without all doubt they have been handed down to us, from these Times.</P>
<P>AND as it is not to be question'd, but we had them from the Heathens, so in all proba∣bility the Heathens have taken them from the People of GOD, and built many of their Folies and ominous Superstitions on a Custom which they alone were indulged in. For in the ear∣liest Ages of the World, when a Matter of a∣ny great Consequence was depending, and the Servants of GOD would know what the E∣vent would be, they asked a <HI>Sign</HI> of GOD, by desiring that such a Thing might happen, if they were to succeed, and GOD was some∣times so condescending as to grant them their desire. Thus we read, That <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sam. i. 14. iii. 20.</NOTE> <HI>Jonathan</HI> ac∣company'd only by his Armour-Bearer, not fear∣ing
<PB N="73" REF="92"/>
the Steepness of the Rocks, nor Multi∣tudes of Enemies, attempted the Garrison of the <HI>Philistines</HI> and conquered, through a To∣ken of this Nature. <HI>If they say,</HI> says he to his Armour-Bearer, <HI>Tarry untill we come up, then we will stand still in our Place, and will not go up unto them; but if they say come up unto us, then we will go up; for the LORD hath delivered them into our Hands, and this shall be a Sign unto us.</HI> And so indeed it came to pass, GOD who had inspired <HI>Jonathan</HI> with this Thought, directing the Tongues of the others according to his Wishes. In like Manner, when the good old Servant of <HI>Abraham</HI> had arrived at the City of <HI>Nahor,</HI> to find a Wife for his Master's Son; we have him desiring of GOD, that the Sign of the Woman he should pitch upon, might be her saying, <HI>Drink, and I will give thy Camels drink also.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gen. xxiv. 12.</NOTE> <HI>And he said, O Lord GOD of my Master</HI> Abraham, <HI>I pray thee send me good speed this Day, and shew Kindness unto my Master</HI> Abraham: <HI>Behold, I stand here by the Well of Water, and the Daughters of the Men of the City come out to draw Water. And
<PB N="74" REF="93"/>
let it come to pass, that the Damsel to whom I shall say, let down thy Pitcher, I pray thee, that I may Drink; And she shall say, Drink, and I will give thy Camels drink also: Let the same be she that thou hast appointed for thy Servant</HI> Isaac; <HI>and thereby shall I know that thou hast shewed Kindness unto my Master.</HI> This happened ac∣cording to his Prayer, by which he knew that the LORD had prospered his Journey. Now this Custom we know the <HI>Philistines</HI> imitated, when they would know whether they had been afflicted by the GOD of <HI>Israel</HI> for keep∣ing the Ark. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sam. i. 6, 9.</NOTE> <HI>They took the Ark of the LORD, and laid it on a Cart, and sent it away. And they said, If it goeth by the Way of his own Coast to</HI> Beth-shemoth, <HI>then he hath done us this great Evil.</HI></P>
<P>IN these early Ages of the World, GOD permitted such Things upon extraordinary Oc∣casions, to be asked by his own People. But they were only peculiar to those Times. We have no Warrant for doing the like: It be∣comes not us to prescribe Means to GOD, by
<PB N="75" REF="94"/>
which we may judge of our future Success, but to depend on his Power and Wisdom, his Care and Providence. The Observation of Omens, such as the falling of Salt, a Hare crossing the Way, of the Dead-Watch, of Cric∣kets, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are sinful and diabolical: They are the Inventions of the Devil, to draw Men from a due Trust in GOD, and make them his own Vassals.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. X.</HI> Of the Country Conversation in a Winter's Evening: Their Opinions of Spirits and Apparitions; of the Devil's ap∣pearing with a cloven Foot; of Fai∣ries and Hobgoblins; of the walk∣ing Places of Spirits; and of haun∣ted Houses.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">N</SEG>OTHING is commoner in <HI>County Places,</HI> than for a whole Family in a <HI>Winter's Evening,</HI> to sit round the Fire, and tell Stories of Appariti∣ons and Ghosts. And no Question of it, but this adds to the natural Fearfulness of Men, and makes them many Times imagine they see Things, which really are nothing but their
<PB N="77" REF="96"/>
own Fancy. From this, and seldom any o∣ther Cause, it is, that <HI>Herds</HI> and <HI>Shepherds</HI> have all of them seen <HI>frequent Apparitions,</HI> and are generally so well stock'd with Stories of their own Knowledge. Some of them have seen <HI>Fairies,</HI> some <HI>Spirits</HI> in the Shapes of <HI>Cows</HI> and <HI>Dogs</HI> and <HI>Horses;</HI> and some have seen even the <HI>Devil</HI> himself, with a <HI>cloven Foot.</HI> All which, is either <HI>Hearsay</HI> or a <HI>strong Imagina∣tion.</HI> Not that there have not been, or may not be Apparitions; we know that there have undoubtedly been such Things, and that there still are, upon particular Occasions; but that almost all the Stories of Ghosts and Spirits, are grounded on no other Bottom, than the Fears and Fancies, and weak Brains of Men.</P>
<P>IN their Account of the Apparition of the Devil, they always describe him with a <HI>cloven Foot:</HI> That is always his distinguishing Badge, whatever Shape he appears in; whether it be in Beauty or Deformity, he never appears with∣out it. Such is the old Tradition they have received of his appearing, and such is their Belief of it.</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="97"/>INDEED it must be confess'd, that this is not so improbable and ridiculous as many Things they hold. For tho' perhaps few of them have ought else for this Opinion, but <HI>old Wives Fables,</HI> or the Picture of the Devil, which they have always observed drawn with a cloven Foot, yet there seems to be some Truth in it. For in the Times of frequent Apparitions, the Devil was wont to appear so, if we may believe Antiquity; and there is also some Reason for it, considering the Cir∣cumstances of the fallen Angels.</P>
<P>THE <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Brown<HI>'s</HI> Vulg. Err.</NOTE> Author of the <HI>Vulgar Errors</HI> upon this same Subject, hath these Words. <Q>The Ground of this Opinion at first, might be his frequent appearing in the Shape of a Goat, which answers this Description. This was the Opinion of the ancient Christians, concerning the Apparitions of <HI>Panites, Fauns</HI> and <HI>Satyrs;</HI> and of this Form we read of one, that appeared to <HI>Anthony</HI> in the Wil∣derness. The same is also confirmed from Expositions of Holy Scripture. For where∣as
<PB N="79" REF="98"/>
it is said, <HI>Thou shalt not offer unto Devils:</HI> The original Word is <HI>Seghnirim;</HI> that is, <HI>rough and hairy Goats,</HI> because in that Shape the Devil most often appeared, as is expoun∣ded by the <HI>Rabbins,</HI> as <HI>Tremellius</HI> hath also explain'd, and as the Word <HI>Ascimah,</HI> the God of <HI>Emath</HI> is by some conceived. He observes also, That the <HI>Goat</HI> was the Em∣blem of the <HI>Sin Offering,</HI> and is the Emblem of sinful Men at the Day of Judgment.</Q></P>
<P>AND of this Opinion was also the learned Mr. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mede, Dis. <HI>40.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Mede.</HI> He says, <Q>That when Spirits converse with Men, it is under some visible Shape, and that there is a Law given them that that Shape they assum'd, should be of something which more or less resembled their Condition. For as in Nature we see every Thing hath a several and suitable <HI>Phy∣siognomy</HI> or <HI>Figure,</HI> as a Badge of their in∣ward Nature, whereby it is known, as by a Habit of Distinction, so it seems to be in the Shapes and Apparitions of Spirits. And as in a well governed Common-Wealth, eve∣ry
<PB N="80" REF="99"/>
Sort and Condition is known by a diffe∣ring Habit, agreeable to his Quality; so it seems it should be in GOD'S great Common-Wealth, concerning the Shapes which Spi∣rits take upon them. And he that gave the Law, that a Man should not wear the Ha∣bit of a Woman, nor a Woman the Habit of a Man, because that as he had made them diverse, so would he have them so known by their Habits; so it seems he will not suf∣fer a good and a bad Spirit, a noble and ig∣noble one, to appear unto Man after the same Fashion.</Q></P>
<P><Q>NOW from this it will follow, that good Angels can take upon them no other Shape, but the Shape of Man, because their glori∣ous Excellency is resembled only in the most excellent of all visible Creatures. The Shape of an inferior Creature would be un∣suitable, no other Shape becoming those who are called <HI>the Sons of GOD,</HI> but his only, who <HI>was created after GOD's own Image.</HI> And yet, not his neither as he now is, but according as he was before his Fall
<PB N="81" REF="100"/>
in his glorious Beauty of his Integrity. Age and Deformity are the Fruits of Sin; and the Angel in the Gospel appears like a young Man, <HI>His</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matth. xxviii.</NOTE> <HI>Countenance like Lightning, and his Raiment white as Snow,</HI> as it were resem∣bling the Beauty of glorified Bodies, in Im∣mutability, Sublimity and Purity.</Q></P>
<P><Q>HENCE also it follows on the contrary, that the Devil could not appear in humane Shape whilst Man was in his Integrity; be∣cause he was a Spirit fallen from his first glorious Perfection, and therefore must ap∣pear in such Shape, which might argue his Imperfection and Abasement, which was the Shape of a Beast: Otherwise no Reason can be given, why he should not rather have appeared to <HI>Eve</HI> in the Shape of a Woman, than of a Serpent; for so he might have gain'd an Opinion with her, both of more Excellency and Knowledge. But since the Fall of Man, the Case is alter'd; now we know he can take upon him the Shape of Man; and no Wonder, since one falling Star
<PB N="82" REF="101"/>
may resemble another. And therefore he appears it seems in the Shape of Man's Im∣perfection, either for Age or Deformity, as like an old Man (for so the Witches say:) And perhaps it is not altogether false, which is vulgarly affirmed, that the Devil appear∣ing in humane Shape, hath always a Defor∣mity of some uncouth Member or other; as tho' he could not yet take upon him hu∣mane Shape intirely, for that Man himself is not intirely and utterly fallen as he is.</Q></P>
<P>THUS far hath this great and learned Man given his Opinion of this Matter, and that with such Strength of Reason and Argument, as leaves at least a Probability behind it, of the Truth of this Opinion.</P>
<P>ANOTHER Part of this Conversation gene∣rally turns upon <HI>Fairies.</HI> These, they tell you, have frequently been heard and seen, nay that there are some still living who were stollen away by them, and confined seven Years. According to the Description they give of them, who pretend to have seen them, they
<PB N="83" REF="102"/>
are in the Shape of Men, exceeding little: They are always clad in Green, and frequent the Woods and Fields; when they make Cakes (which is a Work they have been often heard at) they are very noisy; and when they have done, they are full of Mirth and Pastime. But generally they dance in <HI>Moon-Light,</HI> when Mortals are asleep, and not capable of seeing them, as may be observed on the following Morn; their dancing Places being very distin∣guishable. For as they dance Hand in Hand, and so make a <HI>Circle</HI> in their Dance, so next Day there will be seen <HI>Rings</HI> and <HI>Circles</HI> on the Grass.</P>
<P>NOW in all this there is really nothing, but an old fabulous Story, which has been handed down even to our Days from the Times of <HI>Heathenism,</HI> of a certain Sort of Beings called <HI>Lamiae,</HI> which were esteem'd so mis∣chievous and cruel, as to take away young Children and slay them. These, together with the <HI>Fauns,</HI> the <HI>Gods of the Woods,</HI> seem to have form'd the Notion of Fairies.</P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="103"/>THIS Opinion, in the benighted Ages of Popery, when <HI>Hobgoblins</HI> and <HI>Sprights</HI> were in every <HI>City</HI> and <HI>Town</HI> and <HI>Village,</HI> by every <HI>Wa∣ter</HI> and in every <HI>Wood,</HI> was very common. But when that Cloud was dispell'd, and the Day sprung up, those Spirits which wander'd in the Night of Ignorance and Error, did real∣ly vanish at the Dawn of Truth and the Light of Knowledge.</P>
<P>ANOTHER Tradition they hold, and which is often talk'd of, is, that there are particular Places alotted to Spirits to walk in. Thence it was that formerly, such frequent Reports were abroad of this and that particular Place being haunted by a Spirit, and that the com∣mon People say now and then, such a Place is dangerous to be pass'd through at Night, be∣cause a Spirit walks there. Nay, they'll fur∣ther tell you, that some Spirits have lamented the Hardness of their Condition, in being obli∣ged to walk in cold and uncomfortable Places, and have therefore desir'd the Person who was so hardy as to speak to them, to gift them with a warmer Walk, by some well grown <HI>Hedge,</HI>
<PB N="85" REF="104"/>
or in some <HI>shady Vale,</HI> where they might be shelter'd from the Rain and Wind.</P>
<P>THE Stories, that Apparitions, have been seen oftner than once in the same Place, have no Doubt been the Rise and Spring of the wal∣king Places of Spirits; but why they are said sometimes to cry out for Places that are more comfortable, is not so certainly known. It is however highly probable, that when the Ig∣norance and Superstition of the <HI>Romish</HI> Church, had filled the World with <HI>Apparitions</HI> and <HI>Ghosts,</HI> that this also was invented among them. For they seem to have the most <HI>Right</HI> to an In∣vention of this Nature, whose Brains were so fruitful of Folly, as to invent that <NOTE PLACE="foot"><HI>Fuller</HI>'s Ch. Hist. Cen. 10.</NOTE> <HI>Dunstan</HI> took the Devil by the Nose, with a Pair of hot <HI>Tongs</HI> till he roar'd again. For if the De∣vil may be burnt, he may also be starv'd; if he took such Pains to get his Nose out of the <HI>Pincers,</HI> without Doubt in a frosty Night, he would wish to be as warm as possible. He that believes the one, must necessarily believe the other. And therefore it very near amounts
<PB N="86" REF="105"/>
to a Demonstration, who were the Authors of this Opinion, <HI>viz.</HI> The <HI>Monks.</HI> We are sure they invented the one, and need little que∣stion but they invented the other.</P>
<P>THERE is a Story in the Book of <HI>Tobit,</HI> (which they may believe that will) of the <HI>evil Spirits</HI> flying into the utmost Parts of <HI>Egypt.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tob. vi.</NOTE> <HI>For as</HI> Tobias <HI>went in unto his Wife, he re∣membred the Words of</HI> Raphael, <HI>and took the Ashes of the Perfumes, and put the Heart and Liver of the Fish thereupon, and made a Smoke therewith. The which Smell, when the evil Spirit had smelled, he fled into the utmost Parts of</HI> Egypt, <HI>and the Angel bound him.</HI> Now from this it is evident, that the Spirit was o∣bliged to forsake his good old Quarters and warm Lodgings, for inhospitable Desarts and open Air: And from this, perhaps, some of those <HI>doting Monks,</HI> have persuaded themselves into a Belief of these Things.</P>
<P>WHEN it is proved to us, that this Book of <HI>Tobit</HI> is the Word of GOD, we may enter∣tain
<PB N="87" REF="106"/>
more Veneration for this Vulgar Opini∣on; but till then, we must be iudulg'd in wondering, how a Spirit, that is an <HI>immateri∣al Substance,</HI> can be affected with our Heat or Cold, or any Power or Quality of <HI>material Beings.</HI></P>
<P>THE last Topick of this Conversation I shall take Notice of, shall be the Tales of <HI>haunted</HI> Houses. And indeed it is not to be wonder'd at, that this is never omitted. For formerly almost every Place had a House of this Kind. If a House was seated on some melancholly Place, or built in some old Romantick Man∣ner; or if any particular Accident had hap∣pen'd in it, such as Murder, sudden Death, or the like, to be sure that House had a Mark set on it, and was afterwards esteemed the Habita∣tion of a Ghost. In talking upon this Point, they generally show the Occasion of the House's being <HI>haunted,</HI> the merry Pranks of the Spi∣rit, and how it was laid. Stories of this Kind are infinite, and there are few <HI>Villages,</HI> which have not either had such an House in it, or near it.</P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="107"/>AND indeed there are Men of good Learn∣ing and Knowledge, who are as far as others from Superstition, who are inclinable to be∣lieve, that such Things have been upon par∣ticular Emergencies; tho', among the Stories that are told, they believe not one in a thou∣sand. They know that Spirits have frequent∣ly appeared to Men out of Houses, and they can see no Reason why they may not have ap∣peared in them: They know nothing in an House more than in another Place, to prevent an Apparition, but an equal Help to its Visi∣bility. The Air, which a Ghost is supposed to be wrapped in, when it becomes visible to Men, is there to be found, and they know of nothing else that may be an Argument against it. An Author of good Credit tells us, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cum <HI>Romae</HI> aegra valetudine oppressus forem, jace∣remque in lectulo, speciem mulieris eleganti forma mihi plane vigilanti observatam fuisse, quam cum inspicerem, diu cogitabundus, &amp;c.—Cum meos sensus vigere, &amp; fi∣guram illam nusquam a me dilabi, &amp;c. <HI>Alex. ab Alex.

Upon this he was silent for some Time, and very thoughtful, weigh∣ing all the while with himself, whether it was not rather a <HI>deceptio visus</HI> than a real Being. But when he perceived his Senses sound and intire, and that the Object still continued; he asked, What she was? In Answer to which, she repeated the very Words he had spoke to her, in a sneering and disdainful Manner. After she had taken a good View of him, she departed.</P>
<P>THE Commentator upon this Place, says, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sed haec semper mera somnia esse putavi. <HI>ibid.</HI></NOTE> He looks upon this Story, and the rest which are mention'd along with it, to be nothing but Dreams and Fancies.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XII.</HI> Of <HI>Saturday</HI> Afternoon; how observed of old, by the ancient Christians, the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and the old Church of <HI>England:</HI> What End we should observe it for: An Exhorta∣tion to the Observation of it.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>T is usual, in Country Places and Villages, where the Po∣liteness of the Age hath made no great Conquest, to observe some particular Times with some Ceremonies, which were customary in the Days of our Fore-fathers: Such are the great Festivals of Christmas, Easter, and several o∣thers,
<PB N="116" REF="135"/>
which they observe with Rites and Cu∣stoms appropriated to them.</P>
<P>AMONG these we find a great Deference paid to <HI>Saturday Afternoon,</HI> above the other worky Days of the Week: Then the Labours of the Plough ceast, and Refreshment and Ease are over all the Village.</P>
<P>THIS seems to be the Remains of a lau∣dable Custom once in this Land (but now al∣most buried in that general Contempt of Re∣ligion and love of the World, which prevail so much every where) of attending the Even∣ing Prayers on Saturday, and laying aside the Concerns of this Life, to be fitter for the Duties of the Day following. For <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Baily,</HI> Prac. Piety, <HI>P.</HI> 453.</NOTE> <Q>it was an holy Custom among our Fore-fathers, when at the Ringing to Prayer the <HI>Eve</HI> be∣fore the <HI>Sabbath,</HI> the <HI>Husbandman</HI> would give over his Labour in the Field, and the <HI>Tradesman</HI> his Work in the Shop, and go to Evening Prayer in the Church, to prepare their Souls, that their Minds might more
<PB N="117" REF="136"/>
chearfully attend <HI>GOD's Worship</HI> on the <HI>Sab∣bath-Day.</HI></Q></P>
<P>AND indeed it was the Custom both of the <HI>Jewish</HI> and the Christian Church. They nei∣ther of them entred upon the <HI>Sabbath,</HI> without some Preparation for it. <HI>Moses</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Exod. xvi.—</NOTE> taught the <HI>Jews</HI> to remember the <HI>Sabbath</HI> over Night; from whence in all Probability it comes to pass, that the Eve of the <HI>Jewish Sabbath</HI> is called the <HI>Preparation.</HI> The Preparation mentioned by the Evangelists, begun at Three a Clock on <HI>Friday</HI> Afternoon; it was proclaimed with the Noise of Trumpets and Horns, that they might be better put in Mind of the <HI>Sabbath</HI>'s draw∣ing on, and of that Preparation which was re∣quisite for it.</P>
<P>AMONG the primitive Christians the LORD'S Day was always usher'd in, with a <HI>Pernoctation</HI> or <HI>Vigil.</HI> They assembled in the House of GOD, and sung Psalms and Praises to him a great Part of the Night, that they might be better prepa∣red to serve him on his own Day following.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Mark xiv.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="137"/>IN the Year of our LORD 1203, <HI>William,</HI> King of <HI>Scotland,</HI> called a Council of the chief Men of his Kingdom, at which also was present the Pope's Legate; and it was then determin'd, that <HI>Saturday</HI> after the twelfth Hour should be kept holy; that no one should follow their Business nor Callings, but desist as on other Holy Days: That they should be put in Mind of it by the Tolling of the Bell, and then mind the Business of Religion as on Holy Days, be present at the Sermon, and hear Vespers; that this should be the Practice till <HI>Munday</HI> Morn∣ing, and whoever acted otherwise should be se∣verely punished.</P>
<P>AND this, as is said before, was also the Custom of our own Country, long before this order'd in <HI>Scotland.</HI> For in the Year 958, when<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In <HI>Scotia</HI> anno salutis 1203, <HI>Gulielmus</HI> Rex primorum Regni sui concilium cogit, cui etiam interfuit Pontificius Legatus, in quo decretum est, ut Saturni Dies abhora 12 Meridiei sacer esset, neque quisquam res profanas exerce∣ret, quemadmodum aliis quoque festis diebus vetitum id erat.

when the Bell was heard, attended the Evening Prayer, not fearing the Loss of Time, nor the Necessities of Poverty; happy would it be for us, would we so banish the Care of the Body for the Care of the Soul!

<P>WHEN <HI>Jacob</HI> was going to worship GOD at <HI>Bethel,</HI> he order'd his Family <HI>to</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Gen. xxxv. 2.</NOTE> <HI>put away the strange Gods that were among them, and be clean, and change their Garments, and arise and go to</HI> Bethel. He knew that the GOD of Pu∣rity and Holiness was to be approached with the utmost Purity they could possibly cloth them∣selves with. And would we, before we enter into the Presence of GOD on his own Day, endeavour to purifie our selves from the Filth of the World we have contracted in the Days before; would we disperse these busy Swarms of Things, which so attract our Minds, and prepare our selves for the following Day; we

should appear before GOD, less earthly and more heavenly, less sinful and more holy; <HI>Our</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Psalm cxliv. 2.—</NOTE> <HI>Prayers would be set forth in his Sight as the Incense, and the lifting up of our Hands be an Evening Sacrifice:</HI> And like the Smell of <HI>Ja∣cob</HI>'s Garment in the Nostrils of his Father, the Smell of our Prayers <HI>would</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Gen. xxvii. 27.</NOTE> <HI>be like the Smell of a Field which the LORD hath bles∣sed.</HI></P>
<P>AND now what is this Preparation, but the <HI>Trimming of our Lamps</HI> against we meet the LORD on the next Day? Our Bodies should be refreshed by ceasing early from their Labour, that they may be active and vigorous; and our Souls washed with Sobriety and Tem∣perance, and the private or publick Prayer of the Evening.

These without doubt were acceptable to GOD, and thine undoubtedly will be acceptable also.</P>
<P>BUT if thou art not ty'd down by Neces∣sity, do not say that the common Necessa∣ries of Life require then thy Labour: For this is not losing, but <HI>Redeeming the Time;</HI> what thou spendest in the Care of thy Soul, is not lost in the Care of thy Body.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XIII.</HI> Of the Yule-Clog and Christmas-Candle; what they may signifie; their Antiqui∣ty; the like Customs in other Places.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>N the <HI>Primitive Church,</HI> Christ∣mas-Day was always observ'd as the <HI>Lord's-Day</HI> was, and was in like Manner preceeded by an <HI>Eve or Vigil.</HI> Hence it is that our Church hath ordered an <HI>Eve</HI> before it, which is observed by the Religious, as a Day of Preparation for that great Festival.</P>
<P>OUR Fore-Fathers, when the common De∣votions of the <HI>Eve</HI> were over, and Night was come on, were wont to light up <HI>Candles</HI> of an uncommon Size, which were called <HI>Christmas-Candles,</HI>
<PB N="127" REF="146"/>
and to lay a <HI>Log</HI> of Wood upon the Fire, which they termed a <HI>Yule-Clog,</HI> or <HI>Christ∣mas-Block.</HI> These were to Illuminate the House, and turn the Night into Day; which Custom, in some Measure, is still kept up in the Nor∣thren Parts.</P>
<P>IT hath, in all probability, been derived from the <HI>Saxons.</HI> For <HI>Bede</HI> tells us, That this very Night was observed in this Land before, by the <HI>Heathen Saxons.</HI> They <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Incipiebant autem annum ab octavo calendarum <HI>Ja∣nuarii</HI> die, ubi nunc natale domini celebramus; &amp; ipsam noctem nunc nobis sacro-sanctam tunc gentili vocabulo mae∣drenack, i. e. matrum noctem appellabant: Ob causam, ut suspicamur, ceremoniarum, quas in ea pervigiles age∣bant. <HI>Beda de Rat.

The <HI>Yule-Clog</HI> therefore hath probably been a Part of that Night's Ceremonies. The very Name seems to speak it, and tells its Ori∣ginal to every Age.</P>
<P><PB N="128" REF="147"/>IT seems to have been used, as an Emblem of the return of the <HI>Sun,</HI> and the lengthening of the Days. For as <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>December</HI> guili, eodem quo <HI>Januarius</HI> nomine voca∣tur.—Guili a conversione solis in auctum diei, nomen accipit. <HI>Beda, ibid.</HI></NOTE> both <HI>December</HI> and <HI>Jan∣uary</HI> were called <HI>Guili or</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P><Q><HI>Gehol</HI> or <HI>Geol</HI> Angl-Sax. Jol vel Jul, Dan. Sax. And to this Day in the North <HI>Yule, Youle,</HI> signifies the solemn Festival of <HI>Christmas,</HI> and were Words used to denote a Time of Festivity very anciently, and before the Introduction of Christianity among the Northern Nations. Learned Men have disputed much about this Word, some deriving it from <HI>Julius Caesar,</HI> others from the Word <HI>Geh∣theol,</HI> a <HI>Wheel,</HI> as <HI>Bede,</HI> who would therefore have it so called, because of the Return of the Sun's annual Course, after the Winter Solstice. But he, writing <HI>de Rat. Temp.</HI> speaks rather as an Astronomer than an Antiquary. The best Antiquaries derive it from the Word, <HI>Ol, Ale,</HI> which was much used in their Festivities and merry Meetings. And the <HI>I in Iol, iul cimbr. as the Ge and Gi in Gehol, Geol, Giul, Sax,</HI> are premised only as Intensives to add a little to the Signification, and make it more emphatical. <HI>Ol</HI> or <HI>Ale,</HI> as has been observed, did not only signifie the Liquor they made Use of, but gave Denomination likewise to their greatest Festivals, as that of Gehol or Yule at <HI>Midwinter;</HI> and as is yet plainly to be discern'd in that Custom of the <HI>Whitsun-Ale,</HI> at the other great Festival. <HI>Elstob.

<P><HI>Bishop</HI> Stilingfleet <HI>has also taken Notice of this, and says,</HI> <Q>That some think the Name of this Feast was taken from <HI>Iola,</HI> which in the <HI>Gothick</HI> Language signifies to <HI>make merry.</HI> But he seems not inclinable to this Opinion, and therefore tells us, that <HI>Olaus Rudbeck</HI> thinks the former (<HI>viz.</HI> Its being called so from the Joy that was conceived at the Return of the Sun) more proper, not only from <HI>Bede</HI>'s Authority, but because in the old <HI>Ru∣nick Fasti,</HI> a Wheel was used to denote that Festival. <HI>Stilling.

of the Sun's Returning, and the Increase of the Days; so, I am apt to believe, the Log has had the Name of the <HI>Yule-Log,</HI> from its being burnt as an Emblem of the returning Sun, and the Increase of its Light and Heat.</P>
<P>THIS was probably the Reason of the Cu∣stom among the <HI>Heathen Saxons;</HI> but I cannot think the Observation of it was continued for the same Reason, after Christianity was em∣braced. For Bishop <HI>Stillingfleet</HI> observes in his <HI>Origines Britanicae,</HI> <Q>That tho' the ancient <HI>Saxons</HI> observed Twelve Days at that Time, and sacri∣ficed to the Sun, in hopes of his Returning; yet when Christianity prevail'd, all these Ido∣latrous Sacrifices were laid aside, and that Time of Feasting was joined with the religious So∣lemnity of that Season, which in other Parts of the World were observed by Christians.</Q> And in like Manner as these Days of Feasting were joined with the religious Solemnities of that Season, so the keeping up of this Custom, seems to have been done with another View, than it was originally. If a Conjecture may be allowed, it might have been done on Account
<PB N="130" REF="149"/>
of our Saviour's Birth, which happened that Night. For as the Burning of it before Chri∣stianity, was an Emblem of the Coming of the Sun, which they worshipped as their God; so the continuing it after, might have been for a Symbol of that Light, which was that Night born into the World: <HI>The Light that shineth in Darkness; the Light that lightned the</HI> Gen∣tiles, <HI>that turn'd them from Darkness to Light, and from the Power of Satan unto GOD.</HI></P>
<P>AND indeed it will be some strengthening of the Conjecture, that Light has been the Em∣blem of several Things, both in Scripture, and in the ancient Church: For the Scripture makes use of it, and the Church in Imitation of the Scripture, as a lively Representation of several Things. Thus Light is the Emblem of <HI>GOD: For GOD is Light,</HI> says the Apostle St. <HI>John.</HI> John <HI>the Baptist was a Burning and a Shining Light.</HI> And therefore in some Places it <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Feruntur quoque brandae seu faces ardentes, &amp; fiunt ignos, qui significant sanctum <HI>Joannem,</HI> qui fuit lumen &amp; lucerna ardens, &amp; praecedens &amp; praecursor verae lucis, quae illuminat omnem hominem venientem in hunc mundum. <HI>Durand.

customary to carry Torches on St. <HI>John the Baptist</HI>'s Eve, to represent St. <HI>John Baptist</HI> him∣self, who was <HI>a Burning and a Shining Light, and a Preparer of the Way for the True Light, that lighteneth every Man that cometh into the World.</HI> The Apostles were <HI>the Light of the World;</HI> and as our Saviour was frequently called <HI>Light,</HI> so was this his Coming into the World signified, and pointed out by the Em∣blems of Light: <Q>It was then (says our Coun∣try-man <HI>Gregory</HI>) the longest Night in all the Year; and it was the midst of that, and yet there was Day where he was: For a glo∣rious and betokening Light shined round a∣bout this <HI>Holy Child.</HI> So says Tradition, and so the Masters describe the Night Piece of the Nativity.</Q> If this be called in Questi∣on, as being only Tradition, it is out of Dis∣pute, that the Light which illuminated the Fields of <HI>Bethlehem,</HI> and shone round about the <HI>Shepherds</HI> as they were watching their Flocks, was an Emblem of that Light, which was then come into Word. What <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Quid est quod apparenti angelo divinae quoque clari∣tatis splendor eos circumdedit, quod nunquam in tota te∣stamenti veteris serie &amp; reperimus, cum tam innumeris vi∣cibus angeli prophetis &amp; justis apparuerunt, nusquam eos fulgore divinae lucis homines circumdedisse legimus; nisi quod hoc privilegium recte huius temporis dignitati ser∣vatum est? &amp;c. <HI>Bed.

<PB N="132" REF="151"/>
says <HI>venerable Bede,</HI> that this Apparition of An∣gels was surrounded with that heavenly Light, which is a Thing we never meet with in all the old Testament? For tho' Angels have ap∣peared to Prophets and holy Men, yet we ne∣ver read of their Appearing in such Glory and Splendor before. It must surely be, because this Privilege was reserved for the Dignity of this Time. For when the true Light of the World, was born in the World, it was very proper that the Proclaimer of his Nativity, should appear in the Eyes of Men, in such an heavenly Light, as was before unseen in the World. And that <HI>supernatural Star,</HI> which was the Guide of the <HI>Eastern Magi,</HI> was a Fi∣gure of that <HI>Star,</HI> which was risen out of <HI>Ja∣cob; of that Light which should lighten the</HI> Gentiles. <Q>GOD, says Bishop <HI>Taylor,</HI> sent a miraculous Star, to invite and lead them to a new and more glorious Light, the Light of Grace and Glory.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="133" REF="152"/>IN Imitation of this, as <HI>Gregory</HI> tells us, the Church went on with the Ceremony: And hence it was, that for the three or four First <HI>Centuries,</HI> the whole <HI>Eastern Church,</HI> called the Day, which they observed for our Saviour's Nativity, the <HI>Epiphany</HI> or Manifestation of the Light. And <HI>Cassian</HI> tells us, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Intra <HI>Egypti</HI> Regionem mos iste traditione antiqua servatur, ut peracto epiphaniorum die, &amp;c. <HI>Cassian, Coll.</HI> 10. <HI>C.</HI> 20.</NOTE> That it was a Custom in <HI>Egypt,</HI> handed down by Tradition, as soon as the <HI>Epiphany,</HI> or <HI>Day of Light</HI> was over, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Hence also came that ancient Custom of the same Church, taken Notice of by St. <HI>Jerome,</HI> of <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Absque martyrum reliquiis per totas orientis ecclesias, quum legendum est evangelium, accenduntur luminaria jam sole rutilante, non utique ad fugandas tenebras, sed ad signum laetitiae demonstrandum, &amp;c. <HI>Jerom, Cont.

<P><PB N="134" REF="153"/>LIGHT therefore having been an Emblem of so many Things, and particularly of our LORD JESUS CHRIST, both in the sacred History, and in the Practice of the Church; it is no way improbable, that after their Conver∣sion, the <HI>Saxons</HI> used it as an Emblem of him, who that Night came into the World, and was the Light thereof. In the City of <HI>Constantino∣ple,</HI> on the <HI>Eve of Easter,</HI> there was a Custom practised, much like this of ours on <HI>Christmas-Eve.</HI> For then the whole City was illumina∣ted with Tapers and Torches, which continued all the Night, turning the Night into Day, till almost the Day appeared. The Reason of this Custom, was to represent that Light which the next Day arose upon the World. The Diffe∣rence between these two Customs, is that of the Time, the Reason of their Observation is much the same. The one illuminated the <HI>Eve of Easter,</HI> that there might be an Emblem of the Sun of Righteousness, who the next Day arose upon the World; the other, the Eve of <HI>Yule,</HI> to give an Emblem of that Light which<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Eus.

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>S soon as the Morning of the <HI>Nativity</HI> appears, it is custom∣ary among the common People to sing a <HI>Christmas-Carol,</HI> which is a Song upon the Birth of our Saviour, and generally sung with some <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Such are,</HI> The New-Year's Songs, <HI>and that whose Bur∣den is</HI> Hagmena. <HI>The Word</HI> Hagmena <HI>is the same as</HI> Hagia∣meene, <HI>or the</HI> Holy Month.

<PB N="140" REF="159"/>
an Interjection of Joy: For in ancient Times, the Burden of the Song, when Men were Mer∣ry, was <HI>Rola, Rola.</HI></P>
<P>THIS kind of Songs is of an Ancient stand∣ing: They were sung early in the Church it self, in memory of the Nativity, as the many HYMNS for that Season manifestly declare: <HI>Tertullian</HI> says, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ut quisque de scripturis sanctis vel de proprio inge∣nio potest, provocatur in medium Deo cantare. <HI>Tertul. Advers. Gent. C.</HI> 39.</NOTE> it was customary among the Christians, at their Feasts, to bring those, who were able to sing, into the Midst, and make them sing a Song unto <HI>GOD;</HI> either out of the Holy Scripture, or of their own Composing and Invention. And as this was done at their Feasts, so no doubt it was observed at the great Feast of the Nativity; which Song, no Question of it, was to them, what the <HI>Christmas-Carol</HI> should be to us. In after Ages we have it also taken Notice of: For <HI>Durand</HI> tells us, <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">In quibusdam quoque locis.—In natali Praelati cum suis clericis ludant, vel in domibus episcopalibus: Ita ut etiam descendant.—Ad cantus. <HI>Durand.

<PB N="141" REF="160"/>
of some Churches to sing among their Clergy, in the Episcopal House, which Song was undoubtedly a <HI>Christmas-Carol.</HI></P>
<P>THE Reason of this Custom seems to be an Imitation of the <HI>Gloria in Excelsis,</HI> or <HI>Glory be to GOD on High,</HI> &amp;c. which was sung by the Angels, as they hovered o'er the Fields of <HI>Beth∣lehem,</HI> in the Morning of the Nativity. For e∣ven that Song, as the learned Bishop <HI>Taylor</HI> ob∣serves, was a Christmas-Carol. <HI>As soon,</HI> says he, <HI>as these blessed Choristers had sung their Christmas-Carol, and taught the Church a Hymn, to put into her Offices for Ever, in the Anniver∣sary of this Festivity; the Angels,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>WAS this performed with that Reverence and Decency, which are due to a Song of this Nature, in Honour of the Nativity, and Glo∣ry to our LORD, it would be very commend∣able; but to sing it, as is generally done, in the midst of <HI>Rioting and Chambering, and Wan∣toness,</HI> is no Honour, but Disgrace; no Glory, but an Affront to that Holy Season, a Scandal to Religion, and a Sin against CHRIST.</P>

<P><Q>BISHOP <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Orig. Brit.

<P>THE Poet <HI>Naogeorgus</HI> says, <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot"><Q><L>Jani—Calendis,</L><L>Atque etiam strenae charis mittuntur amicis:</L><L>Conjuiibus{que} viri donant, gnatis{que} parentes,</L><L>Et domini famulis, &amp;c.</L><BIBL><HI>Hosp. de Orig.

<PB N="144" REF="163"/>
tells us, was an ancient Custom of the Heathens, and afterwards practis'd by the Chri∣stians.</P>
<P>AND no doubt, those Christians were high∣ly worthy of Censure, who imagined, as the Heathens did, that the sending of a Present then, was any way <HI>Lucky,</HI> and an <HI>Omen</HI> of the Success of the following Year. For this was the very Thing that made both several Holy Men, and some general Councils, take notice of, and forbid any such Custom: because the Observance of it, out of any such Design and View, was Superstitious and Sinful. We are told, in a Place of St. <HI>Austin,</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Citatur locus ex <HI>Augustino,</HI> in quo praecipitur, ne ob∣serventur calendae <HI>Januarii,</HI> in quibus cantilenae quaedam, &amp; commessationes, &amp; ad invicem dona donentur, quasi in principio anni, boni fati augurio. <HI>Hosp. de Orig. Fest. Christ. in Fest. Jan.</HI></NOTE> the Observati∣on of the Calends of <HI>January</HI> is forbid, the Songs which were wont to be sung on that Day, the Feastings, and the Presents which were then sent as a Token and Omen of a good Year. But to send a Present at that Time, out of E∣steem, or Gratitude, or Charity, is no where
<PB N="145" REF="164"/>
forbid: On the Contrary, it is Praise worthy. For tho' the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In calendas <HI>Januarias</HI> antiqui patres vehementius in∣vehebantur, non propter istas missitationes adinvicem, &amp; mutui amoris pignora, sed propter diem idolis dicatum: Propter ritus quosdam profanos, &amp; sacrilegos in illa solen∣nitate adhibitos. <HI>Mountacut. Orig. Eccles. Pars Prior. P.</HI> 128.</NOTE> ancient Fathers did vehemently invey against the Observation of the Calends of <HI>January;</HI> yet it was not because of those Pre∣sents, and Tokens of mutual Affection and Love that passed; but because the Day it self was dedicated to Idols, and because of some pro∣phane Rites and Ceremonies they observed in solemnizing it. If then I send a New-Year's Gift to my Friend, it shall be a Token of my Friendship; if to my Benefactor, a Token of my Gratitude; if to the <HI>Poor,</HI> (which at this Time must never be forgot) it shall be to make their Hearts sing for Joy, and give Praise and Adoration to <HI>the Giver of all good Gifts.</HI></P>
<P>ANOTHER old Custom at this Time, is the wishing of a <HI>good New-Year,</HI> either when a New-Year's Gift is presented, or when Friends meet, or when a New-Year's Song is sung at
<PB N="146" REF="165"/>
the Door; the Burden of which is, <HI>we wish you a happy New-Year.</HI></P>
<P>THIS is also a Custom among the Modern <HI>Jews,</HI> who on the first Day of the Month <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>The Month <HI>Tisri,</HI> was the seventh Month according to the <HI>Jews</HI> sacred Computation; and therefore it is com∣manded to be celebrated the first Day of the seventh Month, <HI>Lev. xxiii. 24.</HI> But according to their civil Computation, it was their first Month; so that Feast may be termed their New-Year's Day.</Q> Goodw. Antiq. Lib. 3. Cap. 7.</NOTE> <HI>Tisri,</HI> have a splended <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Reperiunt mensam dulcissimis cibis instructam: E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> cum assederint, quivis partem de cibis illis sumit, &amp; annus, inquit, bonus &amp; dulcis sit nobis omnibus. <HI>Hosp. de Fest. Orig. P.</HI> 54.</NOTE> Entertainment, and wish each other a happy New-Year.</P>
<P>NOW the Original of this Custom is Hea∣thenish, as appears by the Feasting and Presents before mentioned, which were a Wish for a good Year. And it was customary among the Hea∣thens on the Calends of <HI>January,</HI> to go about and sing a <HI>New-Year's Song. Hospinian</HI> there∣fore tells us, That <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Discurrunt namque noctu, tam senes quam juvene<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> promiscui sexus, cantantes prae foribus divitum, quibus fae¦licem annum cantando precantur &amp; optant. <HI>Hospin. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Orig.

<PB N="147" REF="166"/>
Sexes, run about here and there, and sing a Song at the Doors of the wealthier People, in which they wish them a <HI>happy New-Year.</HI> This he speaks indeed of the Christians, but he calls it an exact Copy of the Heathens Custom.</P>
<P>BUT however I cannot see the Harm of re∣taining this ancient Ceremony, so it be not used superstitiously, nor attended with Obsce∣nity and Lewdness. For then there will be no more in it, than an hearty Wish for each o∣thers Welfare and Prosperity; no more Harm, than wishing a good Day, or good Night; than in bidding one <HI>GOD speed;</HI> or than in wishing to our Friend, what <HI>Abraham</HI>'s Servant did to himself, <HI>O</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gen. xxiv. 12.</NOTE> <HI>LORD GOD of my Master</HI> A∣braham, <HI>I pray thee send me good speed this Day.</HI></P>
<P>THERE is another Custom observed at this Time, which is called among us <HI>Mumming;</HI> which is a changing of Clothes between Men and Women; who when dress'd in each others Habits, go from one Neighbour's House to ano∣ther,
<PB N="148" REF="167"/>
and partake of their <HI>Christmas-Cheer,</HI> and make merry with them in Disguise, by dancing and singing, and such like Merriments.</P>

'Tis probable this was done in Memory of the Liberty en∣joy'd in the <HI>Golden Age,</HI> under <HI>Saturn,</HI> before the Names of Servant and Master were known to the World. Be∣sides this they sent Presents to one another, among Friends. No War was to be proclaim'd, and no Offender executed. The Schools kept a Vacation, and nothing but Mirth and Freedom was to be met with in the City. They kept at first only one Day, the Fourteenth of the Kalends of <HI>Janu∣ary;</HI> but the Number was afterwards increas'd to three, four, five, and some say seven Days. <HI>Kennet. Rom.

They there∣fore decreed, that no Man should be Cloathed with a Woman's Garment, no Woman with a Man's.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XVII.</HI> Of the Twelfth Day; how observed: The Wickedness of observing the Twelve Days after the common Way.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">O</SEG>N the <HI>Epiphany,</HI> or <HI>Manifestati∣on of CHRIST to the</HI> Gen∣tiles, commonly called the Twelfth-Day, the <HI>Eastern Magi</HI> were guided by the Star, to pay their Homage to their Saviour; and because they came that Day, which is the Twelfth after the Day of the Nativity, it is therefore called the <HI>Twelfth-Day.</HI></P>
<P>The Twelfth-Day it self is one of the great∣est of the Twelve, and of more jovial Obser∣vation than the Others, for the visiting of
<PB N="152" REF="171"/>
Friends and Christmas-Gambols. The Rites of this Day are different in divers Places, tho' the End of them is much the same in all; namely, to do honour to the Memory of the <HI>Eastern Magi,</HI> whom they suppose to have been Kings. In <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In <HI>Gallia</HI> unus ex ministris, &amp;c.—Idem in <HI>Germa∣nia,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Hospin. in Epiphan.</HI></NOTE> <HI>France,</HI> one of the Courtiers is chosen King, whom the King him∣self, and the other Nobles attend at an En∣tertainment. In <HI>Germany,</HI> they observe the same Thing on this Day in Academies and Cities, where the Students and Citizens create one of themselves <HI>King,</HI> and provide a Magni∣ficent Banquet for him, and give him the At∣tendance of a <HI>King,</HI> or a <HI>stranger Guest.</HI> Now this is answerable to that Custom of the <HI>Sa∣turnalia,</HI> of <HI>Masters</HI> making <HI>Banquets</HI> for their <HI>Servants,</HI> and waiting on them; and no Doubt this Custom has in Part sprung from that.</P>
<P>NOT many Years ago, this was a common <HI>Christmas-Gambol</HI> in both our <HI>Universities;</HI> and it is still usual in other Places of our
<PB N="153" REF="172"/>
Land, to give the Name of <HI>King</HI> or <HI>Queen</HI> to that Person, whose extraordinary Luck hits upon that Part of the divided <HI>Cake,</HI> which is honour'd above the others, with a <HI>Bean</HI> in it.</P>
<P>BUT tho' this be generally the greatest of the Twelve, yet the others preceeding are observed with Mirth and Jollity, generally to Excess. Was this Feasting confined within the Bounds of Decency and Moderation, and gave more way than it does to the Exercises and the Re∣ligious Duties of the Season, it would have nothing in it immoral or sinful. The keeping up of Friendship, and Love, and old Acquain∣tance, has nothing in it harmful; but the Misfortune is, Men upon that Bottom, act ra∣ther like Brutes than Men, and like Heathens than Christians; and the Preservation of Friendship and Love, is nothing else but a Pretence for Drunkenness, and Rioting, and Wantonness And such I am afraid hath been the Observation of the Christmas-Holy-days, since the holiest Times of the Christian Church; and the generality of Men have rather look'd
<PB N="154" REF="173"/>
upon them, as a <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide Bishop <HI>Blackall</HI>'s Sermon on the Lawfulness and the right Manner of keeping Christmass and other Christian Festi∣vals.</NOTE> Time of Eating and Drink∣ing, and Playing, than of returning Praises and Thanksgivings to GOD, for the greatest Benefit he ever bestow'd upon the Sons of Men.</P>
<P><HI>Gregory Nazianzen,</HI> in that excellent Orati∣on of his upon Christmas-Day, says, Let us not celebrate the Feast after an Earthly, but an Heavenly Manner; let not our Doors be crown'd; let not Dancing be encourag'd; let not the Cross-paths be adorned, the Eyes fed, nor the Ears delighted, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Let us not Feast to excess, nor be Drunk with Wine, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> From this we may clearly see, what has been the Custom in these Days. And in all Probability it has been much the same among us, from the Beginning of Christianity: However fabulous that Story may be, taken Notice of by <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Origin. Britan. Stilling.</NOTE> Bishop <HI>Stilling fleet,</HI> from <HI>Hector Boethius,</HI> <Q>That King <HI>Arthur</HI> kept with his Nobles at <HI>York,</HI> a very

For in the Laws of <HI>Canutus,</HI> it is order'd, <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Atque ab ipso natali Jesu Christi die ad octavam ab Epiphania lucem, jejunia nemo observato, nisi quidam ju∣dicio ac voluntate fecerit sua, aut id ei fuerit a sacerdote imperatum. <HI>Seld.

For as the learned Bishop goes on, <Q><HI>Buchannan</HI> is so well pleased with this notable Observation, that he sets it down for good History, saying upon it, that the old <HI>Saturnalia</HI> were re∣new'd, only the Days increased, and <HI>Sa∣turn</HI>'s Name chang'd to <HI>Caesar</HI>'s: For says he, we call the Feast <HI>Julia.</HI> But why should the Name of <HI>Saturn</HI> be changed into <HI>Caesar</HI>'s? Was he worshipped for a GOD among the
<PB N="156" REF="175"/>
<HI>British</HI> Christians, as <HI>Saturn</HI> was among the old <HI>Pagans?</HI> But the Name <HI>Julia</HI> imports it; by no Means. For <HI>Buchannon</HI> does not prove, that this Name was ever used for that Festival among the <HI>Britains;</HI> and the <HI>Saxons,</HI> who brought in both the Name and the Feast, give another <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide Chap. Christ. Candle.</NOTE> Reason for it.</Q></P>
<P><HI>BUCHANNAN</HI> seems therefore to have a great deal more Malice than Truth on his Side. But however such Revellings, and Fro∣licks, and Extravagances, whether or not de∣rived from the old <HI>Saturnalia,</HI> as are customary at this Season, do come very near to, if not ex∣ceed its Liberties. In particular, what commo∣ner at this Season, than <HI>for Men to rise early in the Morning, that they may follow strong Drink, and continue untill Night, till Wine inflame them? As if CHRIST who came into the World to save us, and was manifested to destroy the Works of the Devil;</HI> was to be honour'd with the very Works he came to destroy.</P>
<P><PB N="157" REF="176"/>WITH some, <HI>Christmass</HI> ends with the <HI>Twelve Days,</HI> but with the Generality of the Vulgar, not till <HI>Candlemass.</HI> Till then they continue Feasting, and are ambitious of keeping some of their <HI>Christmass-Chear,</HI> and then are as fond of getting quit of it. <HI>Durand</HI> tells us, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hanc Quadragessimam cum gaudio celebramus, quia Christi incarnatio fuit gaudium angelorum &amp; hominum. <HI>Durand.

Fortune of the following Year, is no easy Matter to find out. The Monks who were undoubtedly the first who made this wonder∣ful Observation, have taken Care it should be handed down to Posterity, but why and for what Reason this Observation was to stand good, they have taken Care to conceal. In Church Affairs indeed they make free with handing down <HI>Traditions</HI> from Generation to Generation, which being approved by an in∣fallible Judgment, are to be taken for granted; but as far as I hear, they never pretended to an infallible Spirit, in the Study of the Pla∣nets. One may therefore, without the Sus∣picion of Heresy, or fear of the <HI>Inquisition,</HI> make a little Inquiry into this Affair, and see whether it be true or false, whether it is built upon any Reason or no Reason, whether still to be observed, or only laugh'd at as a Mon∣kish Dream.</P>
<P>NOW as it is the Day of that Saint, <HI>the great Apostle St.</HI> Paul, I cannot see there is any Thing to be built upon. He did indeed <HI>labour more abundantly than all the Apostles;</HI> but ne∣ver,
<PB N="162" REF="181"/>
that I heard, in the Science of Astrology. And why his Day should therefore be a stand∣ing <HI>Almanack</HI> to the World, rather than the Day of any other <HI>Saint,</HI> will be pretty hard to find out. I am sure there is a good Num∣ber of them, have as much Right to Rain or fair Weather as St. <HI>Paul,</HI> and if St. <HI>Andrew,</HI> St. <HI>Thomas,</HI> &amp;c. have not as much Right to Wind or Snow, let the Reader judge.</P>
<P>AS it is the Twenty fifth Day of <HI>January,</HI> one would think that could be no Reason. For what is that Day more than another? In∣deed they do give some Shew of Reason, why Rain should happen about the Time of St. <HI>Swithin,</HI> which is this. About the Time of his Feast, which is on the Fourteenth of <HI>July,</HI> there are two rainy <HI>Constellations,</HI> which are called <HI>Praecepe</HI> and <HI>Asellus,</HI> which arise <HI>cosmi∣cally,</HI> and generally produce Rain. And to be sure in the Course of the Sign <HI>Aquarius,</HI> there may be both Rain and Wind and fair Weather, but how these can foretell the Destiny of the Year, is the Question.</P>
<P><PB N="163" REF="182"/>AS then there is nothing in the <HI>Saint</HI> or his Day to prognosticate any such Thing, I mean, as it is the Day of St. <HI>Paul,</HI> or the Twenty fifth of <HI>January,</HI> so I must confess I cannot find out what may be the Ground of this particular Observation. But however thus much is very obvious, that this Observation is an exact Copy of that superstitious Custom a∣mong the Heathens, of observing one Day as good, and another as bad. For among them, were lucky and unlucky Days; some were <HI>dies atri,</HI> and some <HI>dies albi;</HI> the <HI>atri</HI> were pointed out in their <HI>Calendar,</HI> with a black Character, the <HI>albi</HI> with a white; the former to denote it a Day of bad Success, the latter a Day of good. Thus have the <HI>Monks</HI> in the dark and unlear∣ned Ages of Popery copy'd after the Heathens, and dream'd themselves into the like Supersti∣tions, esteeming one Day more successful than another; and so according to them, it is very unlucky to begin any Work upon <HI>Childermass-Day;</HI> and what Day soever that falls on, whe∣ther on a <HI>Munday, Tuesday,</HI> or any other, no∣thing must be begun on that Day through the Year; St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s Day is the Year's <HI>Fortune-Teller,</HI>
<PB N="164" REF="183"/>
St. <HI>Mark</HI>'s Day is the Prognosticator of your Life and Death, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and so instead of perswading the People to lay aside the Whims and Fancies of the Heathen World, they brought them so effectually in, that they are still reigning in many Places to this Day.</P>
<P>BUT of all the Days of the Year, they could not have chosen one so little to the Pur∣pose. For the very Saint, whose Day is so observed, has himself cautioned them against any such Observation: For in the Fourth Chapter of his Epistle to the <HI>Galations,</HI> he tells them, how dangerous it was <HI>to observe Days and Months, and Times, and Years;</HI> which is not, as some would perswade us, to Caution us against the Observation of any Day but the <HI>Lord's-Day;</HI> but only that we should not ob∣serve the abolished Feasts of the <HI>Jews,</HI> nor the abominable Feasts of the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> nor their superstitious Observation of fortunate and un∣fortunate Days. St. <HI>Austin,</HI> upon this Place, hath these Words, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Non itaque dies observemus, &amp; annos &amp; menses, &amp; tempora, ne audiamus ab apostolo, timeo vos, ne forte sine causa laboraverim in vobis. Eos enim culpat, qui dicunt, non profisiscar, quia posterus est, aut quia luna sic fertur, vel profisiscar, ut prospera cedant, quia ita se ha∣bet positio siderum, &amp;c. <HI>Beda ex Augustin. in loc.</HI></NOTE> Let us not observe Years,
<PB N="165" REF="184"/>
and Months, and Times, least we hear the A∣postle telling us, I am afraid of you, least I have shewn on you labour in Vain. For the Persons he blames, are those who say, I will not set forward on my Journey, because it is the next Day after such a Time, or because the Moon is so; or I'll set forward that I may have Luck, because such is just now the Po∣sition of the Stars. I will not Traffick this Month, because such a Star presides, or I will, because it does. I shall plant no Vines this Year, because it is Leap-Year, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>THE learned Mr. <HI>Bingham,</HI> has among se∣veral others, a Quotation from the same St. <HI>Austin</HI> on these superstitious Observations, with which I shall conclude this Chap∣ter. <Q>To this kind, says he, belong all Li∣gatures and Remedies, which the School of Physicians reject and condemn; whether in Inchantments, or in certain Marks, which<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Bingham, <HI>16</HI> L.

they call Characters, or in some other Things which are to be hanged and bound about the Body, and kept in a dancing Posture; not for any Temperament of the Body, but for certain Significations, either Ocult, or Manifest: Which by a gentler Name, they call Physical, that they may not seem to affright Men with the Appearance of Super∣stition, but do good in a natural Way: Such are Ear-rings hanged upon the Tip of each Ear, and Rings made of an Ostriches Bones for the Finger; or when you are told in a Fit of Convulsions, or Shortness of Breath, to hold your left Thumb with your right Hand. To which may be added a thousand vain Observations, as, if any of our Members beat; if when two Friends are talking together, a Stone, or a Dog, or a Child, happens to come between them, they tread the Stone to Pieces, as the Divi∣der of their Friendship, and this is toller∣able in Comparison of beating an innocent Child that comes between them. But it is more pleasant, that sometimes the Childrens Quarrel is revenged by the Dogs; for ma∣ny
<PB N="167" REF="186"/>
Times they are so superstitious, as to dare to beat the Dog that comes between them, who turning again upon him that smites him, sends him from seeking a vain Remedy, to seek a real Physician indeed. Hence proceed likewise these other Super∣stitions: For a Man to tread upon his Thre∣shold when he passes by his own House, to return back to Bed again, if he chance to sneeze as he is putting on his Shoes; to return into his House, if he stumble at his Going out; if the Rats knaw his Clothes, to be more terrified with the Suspicion of some future Evil, than concerned for the present Loss. He says, <HI>Cato</HI> gave a wise and smart Answer to such an one, who came in some Consternation to consult him, about the Rats having knawed his Stock∣ings; that, said he, is no great Wonder, but it would have been a Wonder indeed, if the Stockings had knawed the Rats. St. <HI>Austin</HI> mentions this witty Answer of a wise Heathen, to convince Christians the better of the Unreasonableness and Vanity of all such superstitious Observations. And
<PB N="168" REF="187"/>
he concludes, that all such Arts, whether of triffling or more noxious Superstition, are to be rejected and avoided by Christians, as proceeding originally from some pernici∣ous Society between Men and Devils, and being the Compacts and Agreements of such treacherous and deceitful Friendship. The Apostle forbids us to have Fellowship with Devils; and that, he says, respects not only Idols, and Things offered to Idols, but all imaginary Signs pertaining to the Worship of Idols, and also all Remedies, and other Observations, which are not appointed pub∣lickly by GOD to promote the Love of GOD and our Neighbour, but proceed from the private Fancies of Men, and tend to delude the Hearts of poor deluded Mortals. For these Things have no natural Virtue in them, but owe all their Efficacy to a pre∣sumptuous Confederacy with Devils: And they are full of pestiferous Curiosity, tor∣menting Anxiety, and deadly Slavery. They were first taken up, not for any real Power to be discerned in them, but gained their Power by Mens observing them. And there∣fore
<PB N="169" REF="188"/>
by the Devil's Art they happen dif∣ferently to different Men, according to their own Apprehensions and Presumptions. For the great Deceiver knows, how to procure Things agreeable to every Man's Temper, and ensnare him by his own Suspicions and Consent.</Q></P>

in Honour of the Virgin <HI>Mary;</HI> for as on the Day of a Woman's being <HI>church'd,</HI> there is no common Entertainment, so it seems, that this Feasting was begun in the Times of Popery, by Way of Compliment to the Churching-Day of the Virgin <HI>Mary.</HI></P>

And again, O LORD JESU, I beseech thee, that thou wouldst bless this thy Creature of <HI>Wax,</HI> and grant it thy Heavenly Benediction, by the Power of thy Holy Cross; that as it was a Gift to Man by which the Darkness might be driven away, so now it may be en∣dow'd with such Virtue by the <HI>Sign of the</HI> Holy Cross, that wheresoever it is lighted and placed, the evil Spirit may tremble, and, with his Servants, be in such Terror and Confusion as to fly away from that Habitation, and no more vex and disturb thy Servants.</P>
<P>AFTER this, he adjures the <HI>Wax Candles,</HI> in Words like these. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Adjuro te creaturam ceream in nomine Domini no∣stri &amp; sanctae Trinitatis, ut sis extirpatio &amp; depulsio dia∣boli &amp; spectrorum ejus, &amp;c. <HI>Hospin. ibid.</HI></NOTE> I adjure thee, O thou

<P>OUR Author upon this, says, That this is manifest Blasphemy and Idolatry. For as on the one Hand, they take the Name of GOD and the Holy Trinity in vain, so on the other they attribute to a Wax Candle, what should be ascribed to CHRIST alone, and the quick∣ning Power of the Holy Ghost.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>T is a <HI>Ceremony,</HI> never omitted among the Vulgar, to draw Lots, which they Term <HI>Valen∣tines,</HI> on the Eve before <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Valentine</HI> a Presbyter of the Church was beheaded un∣der <HI>Claudius</HI> the Emperor.</NOTE> <HI>Va∣lentine-day.</HI> The Names of a select Number of one Sex, are by an equal Number of the other put into some Vessel; and after that, every one draws a Name, which for the present is called their <HI>Valentine,</HI> and is also look'd upon as a good Omen of their be∣ing Man and Wife afterwards.</P>

From this perhaps the youthful Part of the World hath first practised this Custom, so common at this Season.</P>
<P>In the <HI>Trullan</HI> Council we have Lots and Divinations forbid, as being some of those Things which <HI>provoked the LORD to anger</HI> against King <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>2</HI> Lib. Kings, Chap. <HI>21.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Manasses,</HI> who used Lots and <HI>Divinations,</HI> &amp;c. upon which the <HI>Scholiast</HI> hath these Words. <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Can. <HI>65.</HI> in Syn. Trull. in Bals. P. <HI>440.</HI></NOTE> The Custom of drawing Lots was after this Manner; on the 23rd Day of
<PB N="176" REF="195"/>
<HI>June,</HI> which is the Eve of St. <HI>John Baptist,</HI> Men and Woman were accustomed to gather together in the Evening by the Sea-side, or in some certain Houses, and there adorn a Girl, who was her Parents first-begotten Child, af∣ter the Manner of a Bride. Then they feast∣ed and leaped after the Manner of <HI>Bacchanals,</HI> and danced and shouted as they were wont to do on their Holy-days: After this they poured into a narrow neck'd Vessel some of the Sea-Water, and put also into it certain Things be∣longing to each of them. Then as if the Devil gifted the Girl, with the Faculty of telling future Things; they would enquire with a loud Voice, about the good or evil Fortune that should attend them: Upon this the Girl would take out of the Vessel, the first Thing that came to Hand, and shew it, and give it to the Owner; who upon receiv∣ing it, was so foolish as to imagine himself wiser, as to the good or evil Fortune that should attend him.</P>
<P>THIS Custom, as he tells us a little after, is altogether diabolical: And surely it was so,
<PB N="177" REF="196"/>
being used as a Presage of what was future. Was the Custom of the Lots now mention'd, used as among the Heathens, they would no Doubt be as worthy of Condemnation; but as far as I know, there is but little Credit given to them; tho' that little is too much, and ought to be laid aside. But if the Cu∣stom was used without any Mixture or Allay of Superstition, as I believe it is in some Pla∣ces, yet it is often attended with great Incon∣veniences and Misfortunes, with Uneasinesses to Families, with Scandal, and sometimes with Ruin.</P>

<P>THIS Custom of confessing to the Priest at this Time, was laid aside by our Church at the Reformation: For Sins are to be confess'd to GOD alone, and not to the Priest, except when the Conscience cannot otherwise be quieted: Then indeed the Grief is to be open∣ed to the Spiritual Guide in private, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Exhort. to the Com.</HI></NOTE> <HI>That by the Ministry of GOD's Word, he may give the Benefit of Absolution, together with ghostly Council and Advice, to the quieting of the Con∣science,

Surely the Church never design'd, when she so justly took away the publick Confessions of this Sea∣son, that Rioting, and Gaming, and Drunken∣ness, should continue amongst us. Are these a fit Preparation for so solemn a Season? Will they qualifie us for the Hearing of the Histo∣ry of our LORD'S Passion? Will they pre∣pare us for the Reception of his Body and Blood?

the Branches of the <HI>Palm-Tree;</HI> it being very Common in that Country, and used as an Emblem of Victory.

<P>BUT however harmless this Custom might have been, in the Times of its first Institution, it is certain, that in after Ages it sunk into Super∣stition and gross Idolatry. Thus the <HI>Rhemists,</HI> in their Translation of the New Testament, de∣scribe the Ceremony themselves: <Q>These Of∣fices of Honour, done to our <HI>Saviour</HI> extra∣ordinarily, were very acceptable. And for a Memory hereof, the Holy Church maketh a solemn Procession every Year upon this Day; specially in our Country, when it was Catholick, with the Blessed Sacrament reverently carryed, as it were CHRIST up∣on the <HI>Ass,</HI> and strawing of Bushes and
<PB N="185" REF="204"/>
Flowers, bearing of Palms, setting up Boughs, spreading and hanging up the richest Clothes, the Quire and Queristers singing, as here the Children and the People; all done in a very godly Ceremony, to the Honour of CHRIST, and the Memory of his Triumph upon this Day. The like Service, and the like Duties done to him in all other solemn Processions of the Blessed Sacrament, and otherwise, be undoubtedly no less grateful.</Q> Dr. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Fulk. in Loc. Mat.</NOTE> <HI>Fulke</HI> upon this, gives this Answer: <Q>Your <HI>Palm-Sunday</HI> Procession was horrible Idolatry, and abusing of the LORDS Insti∣tution, who ordained his Supper to be eaten and drunken, not to be carryed about in Procession like a Heathenish Idol: But it is pretty Sport, that you make the Priests that carryeth this Idol, to supply the Room of the <HI>Ass,</HI> on which CHRIST did ride: Thus you turn the Holy Mistery of CHRIST'S riding to <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> to a <HI>May-game</HI> and pa∣gent Play. And yet you say, such Service done to CHRIST is undoubtedly exceed∣ing grateful; yea, no less grateful, than
<PB N="186" REF="205"/>
that was done by his Disciples, at the Time mentioned in the Text: Your Argument and Proof is none, but your bare Assevera∣tions. That which the Disciples did, had the Warrant of the Holy Scripture; but who hath regarded these Theatrical Pomps at their Hands? Or what Word of GOD have you to assure you that he accepteth such Will-worship? Who detesteth all Wor∣ship, which is according to the Doctrines and Traditions of Men, and not after his own Commandment.</Q></P>
<P>FROM this superstitious and idolatrous Custom, without all doubt it comes to pass, that we now and then, on a <HI>Palm-Sunday,</HI> see the young People carrying <HI>Branches of Palms</HI> in their Hands; which they seem fond of ha∣ving that Day, and which they as little regard at other Times. It is true indeed, it is a Re∣lick of the ancient Superstition of the <HI>Papists,</HI> but as it is now intirely stript of any Super∣stiton, and is an Emblem of the Season, and the Transactions of that Day; so I see no harm in so innocent an Observation.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>T is a common Custom among the Vulgar and uneducated Part of the World, to rise be∣fore the <HI>Sun</HI> on <HI>Easter-day,</HI> and walk into the Fields: The Reason of which, is to see the Sun <HI>Dance;</HI> which they have been told, from an <HI>old Tra∣dition,</HI> always Dances as upon that Day. We read indeed that the Sun once <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Josh x.</NOTE> <HI>stood still,</HI> but whether the Sun danced upon the very Day
<PB N="189" REF="208"/>
our Saviour rose on, we cannot tell: It's very probable it did not, because the Scriptures are silent; and that it never did so since, I think we may be well assur'd; forasmuch as never any, that we have heard of, have seen any such Thing since that Time. If therefore this Tradition hath any Meaning, it must be a <HI>Metaphorical</HI> one; that when the Morning proves clear, there is a seeming Smile over the Face of Nature, and Earth and Heaven shew Tokens of Joy. For as the Earth and her Valleys, by standing thick with Corn, are said, <HI>to laugh and sing;</HI> so, on Account of the Resurrection, the Heavens and the Sun may be said to Dance for Joy; or as the Psalmist Words it, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Psal. xcvi. 11. Caeliquidem digni laetentur, terra au∣tem exultet. <HI>Damasc. in Dominican Pascha, P.</HI> 514.</NOTE> The <HI>Heavens may rejoyce, and the Earth may be glad.</HI></P>
<P>THERE is then, really speaking, nothing in the Dancing of the Sun upon <HI>Easter-Day;</HI> but yet it is a very ancient and commendable Custom to be up early at this Holy Time: And therefore <HI>Damascen,</HI> in his <HI>Paschal Hymn,</HI>
<PB N="190" REF="209"/>
sings, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vigilemus mane profundo, &amp; pro unguenti hymnum afferamus Domino, &amp; Christum videamus justitiae solem, omnibus vitam exorientem. <HI>Ibid.</HI></NOTE> Let us watch very early in the Morn∣ing; and instead of Ointment, let us bring an Hymn to our LORD; and let us see our CHRIST, the <HI>Sun of Righteousness,</HI> who is the Life that riseth to all Men. And indeed it is the most seasonable Time for meditating on our LORD'S Resurrection, and it's pleasing Circumstances. For as the Place where any notable Thing has been transacted, seldom or never fails to raise the Idea of the Transacti∣on; so the particular Time, when it was done, does generally produce the same Effect. And as the Truth of the Former, was the Occasion of many holy and religious Men go∣ing <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Fulk. Test. Cont. Rhem. Matth. Cap. <HI>28.</HI> in Annot.</NOTE> to visit the Place of the Sepulchre, and hear it, as it were, say, what the Angel did to the Women, <HI>Come, see the Place where the LORD lay;</HI> so the Truth of the Latter was the Reason, why devout and holy Men, did in the best Ages of the Church, rise early in the Morning of the Resurrection. The Pri∣mitive Christians spent the Night preceeding
<PB N="191" REF="210"/>
it, in Prayers and Praises, till the Time of <HI>Cock-crow,</HI> the supposed Hour of our Saviour's rising. For as <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Latinorum concors est sententia, Christum non me∣dia nocte, verum mane in aurora, canentibus vice Gallo∣rum angelis, devicta morte &amp; confractis portis inferi, surrexisse. <HI>Durant. de Rit. Lib.</HI> 3. <HI>Cap.</HI> 7.</NOTE> <HI>Durant</HI> tells us, it is univer∣sally assented to by the Latin Church, that after our Saviour had conquer'd Death, and broken the Gates of Hell, he arose from the Dead, not at Mid-night, but in the Morning, at the Time of Cock-crow; which not the Cocks, but the Angels themselves proclaimed. And when these Pernoctations were laid aside, it was the Custom to rise early, and spend the Morning in such a Manner as was suita¦ble to the Nature of the Time. The Saluta∣tion of the <HI>Eastern</HI> Church <HI>Anestese;</HI> or, <HI>The LORD is risen,</HI> and the usual Answer, <HI>The LORD is risen indeed;</HI> were no doubt the common Salutation of that Morning: And if this present Custom of the Vulgar, has had at any Time any laudable Custom for its O∣riginal, it was, no doubt, this of rising early to contemplate the more seasonably on the Resurrection of CHRIST.</P>
<P><PB N="192" REF="211"/>AND now, was this the End of Rising ear∣ly at that Holy Time, it would be very ad∣vantageous; but to rise with the View of the Vulgar, is foolish and ridiculous. Would we rise before the Sun, and prevent the Dawn of Day, our Meditations would be strong and vigorous, and almost persuade us that the real Actions of that Morn, were presented to our View. For when at that Time, all Things are husht in Silence, and warp'd in Darkness, or but illuminated with the friendly Moon, the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Devotae Christi faminae, quae illum &amp; vivum dilexe∣rant &amp; mortuum desiderabant, per noctem ambulantes, juvante luna, venerunt ad monumentum. <HI>Rupert de Divin.

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">O</SEG>N the <HI>Holy-Days of Easter,</HI> it is customary for Work to cease, and Servants to be at Liberty: Which is a Resem∣blance of the Practice of the primitive Church, which set apart the whole Week after <HI>Easter,</HI> for to praise and glorifie GOD, for our SAVIOUR'S Resurrection: In which <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Servos autem &amp; ancillas ac omnes, qui nostro servi∣tio sunt addicti, profecto ab omni servitutis severitate eos hoc tempore laxare debemus.—Ut libere &amp; secure omnes possint ad audiendum divinum officium convenire, &amp; communicare. <HI>Belith.

Servants as well as others might be present at the Devotions of the Season. But other Customs so frequently observed at this Time, such as <HI>publick Shows, Gamings, Horse-Races,</HI> &amp;c. were forbidden, as being foreign to the Holiness of this Season.</P>
<P>IN after Ages, when the Church fell into Corruption, and the Substance of Religion de∣cay'd into the <HI>Shadow of Ceremonies,</HI> the usual Prayers and Praises of the Season, were either much neglected, or but superficially observed. For <HI>Belithus,</HI> a <HI>Ritualist</HI> of those Times tells us, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sunt enim nonnullae ecclesiae, in quibus usitatum est, ut vel etiam episcopi &amp; archiepiscopi in caenobiis cum suis ludant subditis, ita ut etiam ad lusum pilae demittant, &amp;c. <HI>Belith.

<PB N="198" REF="217"/>
formerly, it was customary among the Hea∣thens in that Month to indulge their Servants with a certain Time of Liberty; when they were on the Level with their Masters, and feasted and banqueted with them.</P>
<P>WHY they should play at <HI>Hand-Ball</HI> at this Time rather than any other Game, I have not been able to find out; but I suppose it will be readily granted, that this Custom of so playing, was the Original of our present Recreations and Diversions on <HI>Easter Holy Days,</HI> and in particular of playing at <HI>Hand-Ball for a</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vid.

But for the Governors of Churches to descend to such Childish Exercises, and that even on the <HI>Great Sunday</HI> of the Year, was not only unbecoming their Gravity and Reservedness, but was also a down-right Breach of the fourth

By this Means the Water became infected, and the Air polluted; so that who∣ever drank the Waters, was either tormented with a grievious Distemper, or lost his Life. As soon as the Physicians perceived this, they ordered Fires to be made every where about the Wells and Fountains, and those Things which occasioned the noisomest Smell, to be burnt, knowing that thereby the Dragons would be driven away. And forasmuch as this Custom was observed about the Time we now celebrate St. <HI>John Baptist</HI>'s Feast, it is therefore still observed among some People.

<P>THE <HI>Scholiast</HI> upon this <HI>Canon</HI> hath these Words: The <HI>New-Moon</HI> was always the first Day of the Month, and it was Customary a∣mong the <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Greeks,</HI> to hold then a Feast, and pray that they might be lucky du∣ring the Continuance of the Month. Of these it was, that GOD spake by the Prophet: My Soul hateth your <HI>New-Moons</HI> and your Sab∣baths. And not only this, but they also kindled Fires before their Shops and Houses, and leaped over them; imagining that all the Evils which had befallen them formerly, would be burnt away, and that they should be more successful and lucky afterwards. Now about the Sitting of this Synod, there were some of the Christians, who observed this Cu∣stom
<PB N="214" REF="233"/>
upon the same Accounts that the Hea∣thens did, which occasioned it's being forbid by the Council; and that if a <HI>Clergy-man</HI> was Guilty of it, he should be deposed; if a <HI>Lay-man,</HI> excommunicated. He also tells us, that on St. <HI>John Baptist's-Eve,</HI> the Vulgar were wont to make on Fires for the whole Night, and leap over them, and draw Lots, and Divine about their good or evil Fortune.</P>
<P>BUT whatever Reason the Heathens had for kindling these Fires; whether as <HI>Duran∣dus</HI> thinks, that the lustful <HI>Dragons</HI> might be driven away, or as the <HI>Canon,</HI> that their evil Fortune might be burnt, it is certain that the Custom was invented and practised by them; and because of the Superstion attending the Observation of it, was very justly forbidden by the Council. And undoubtedly was the Making of such Fires now, attended with any such Superstition, it would be equally crimi∣nal to observe them. But <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rogos—quos nos Angli <HI>Bonefires</HI> vocamus, &amp; in publica laetitia &amp; gaudiis adhibemus, non obstante isto canone. <HI>Mountag.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XXVIII.</HI> Of the Feast of Sheep-shearing, an anci∣ent Custom.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE Feast of Sheep-sheering, is generally a Time of Mirth and Joy, and more than or∣dinary Hospitality; indeed it is but little observed in these Northern Parts, but in the Southern it is pretty common. For on the Day they be∣gin to sheer their Sheep, they provide a plen∣tiful Dinner for the Sheerers, and for their Friends who come to visit them on that Occa∣sion; a Table also, if the Weather permit, is spread in the open Village, for the young People and Children.</P>
<P><PB N="217" REF="236"/>AFTER what Manner soever this Custom reach'd us, it is certain it may boast of great Antiquity. It is mention'd in the Second Book of <HI>Samuel,</HI> as a Feast of great Magnifi∣cence, both for Grandeur of Entertainment and Greatness of Company. No less a Person than <HI>Absalom</HI> the King's Son was the Master of this Feast, and no less Persons were the Guests than the King's Sons, the Brethren of <HI>Absalom;</HI> nay it was a Feast that might enter∣tain the King himself, or surely the King would never have been so importun'd, never would have receiv'd the Compliment so kindly. For 'tis said, <HI>It came to pass after two full Years, that</HI> Absalom <HI>had Sheep-sheerers in</HI> Baal∣hazor, <HI>which is beside</HI> Ephraim, <HI>and</HI> Absalom <HI>invited all the King's Sons. And</HI> Absalom <HI>came to the King, and said, Behold, now thy Servant hath Sheep-sheerers, let the King, I beseech thee, and his Servants, go with thy Servant. And the King said, Nay, my Son, let us not all go, lest we be chargeable unto thee.</HI> Of this kind also was the Feast which <HI>Nabal</HI> made for his Sheerers, when <HI>David was driven</HI> to straits in the Wilderness, and sent his Servants to ask
<PB N="218" REF="237"/>
a Present of him. He calls the Day it was held on, a <HI>good Day;</HI> that is, a Day of plenti∣ful Eating and Drinking. And therefore <HI>Na∣bal</HI> answer'd the Servants of <HI>David, shall I then take my Bread and my Water, and my Flesh that I have killed for my Sheerers, and give it unto Men, whom I know not whence they be?</HI> And further, it is said in the same Chapter, that so grand and magnificent was this Feast, <HI>that he had a Feast in his House, like the Feast of a King.</HI> We find also in the Book of <HI>Genesis,</HI> that <HI>Laban</HI> went to sheer his Sheep, in which Time <HI>Jacob</HI> made his Escape, which <HI>Laban</HI> heard not of till the third Day. Of such great Antiquity then is this Custom, and tho' its Antiquity is not of such force as to pal∣liate Luxury and Profusness in these Enter∣tainments; yet no doubt it will vindicate the Harmlesness of a moderate Feast upon this Occasion.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XXIX.</HI> Of <HI>Michaelmass:</HI> Guardian Angels the Discourse of Country People at this Time: that it seems rather true, that we are protected by a Number of An∣gels, than by one particular Genius.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE Feast of this Season is ce∣lebrated in Commemoration of St. <HI>Michael,</HI> and all the Orders of Angels. It is cal∣led, <HI>The Dedication of St. Michael,</HI> because of a Church being dedicated to him on this Day in Mount <HI>Garganus.</HI></P>
<P>AT this Season of the Year, it is a general Custom to elect the Governors of <HI>Towns</HI> and <HI>Cities,</HI> to promote Peace among Men, and
<PB N="220" REF="239"/>
guard them against Harm from their malici∣ous Fellow Creatures. Whether this particu∣lar Time of the Year has been chosen for e∣lecting them, because then is the Feast of An∣gels, the Guardians and Protectors of Men, and of their Communities and <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Daniel, C. <HI>10.</HI></NOTE> Provinces, is not so certain. It is certainer, that when ever it comes, it brings into the Minds of the Peo∣ple, that old Opinion of <HI>Tutelar Angels,</HI> that every Man has his <HI>Guardian Angel;</HI> that is, one particular Angel who attends him from his Coming in, till his Going out of Life, who guides him through the Troubles of the World, and strives as much as he can, to bring him to Heaven.</P>
<P>NOW that good Angels attend good Men is without Dispute. They guide them in the Mazes of the Wilderness of Life, and bring them to their desir'd Homes; they surround them in the Seas of Afflictions, and lead them to the Shores of Peace; and as when the <HI>Is∣raelites</HI> passed through the Red-Sea, <HI>the Cloud became Light to them, but Darkness to their Ene∣mies,</HI>
<PB N="221" REF="240"/>
so in the troublesome Seas of this Life, the <HI>Angels</HI> are both the Guides of good Men, and their Protectors from Evil, from the De∣vil and his Angels. And therefore the Psal∣mist says, <HI>The Angel of the LORD tarrieth round about them that fear him, and delivereth them; and that he will give his Angels Charge over good Men.</HI> They are also supposed to be that Hedge, which GOD placed about <HI>Job,</HI> which the Devil so much complains of; and sure we are, that when the Eyes of <HI>Elisha</HI>'s Servant were open'd, <HI>he saw the Mountain full of Chariots and Horses of Fire round about</HI> Eli∣sha. That therefore good Men are guarded and protected by Angels the Scripture shews very clearly. But that every Man has his particular <HI>Genius,</HI> seems to be founded more upon Tradition, than any Certainty from Scripture. Thus the <HI>Egyptians</HI> believed that every Man had three Angels attending him; the <HI>Pythagoreans,</HI> that every Man had two; the <HI>Romans,</HI> that there was a good and an evil <HI>Genius.</HI> And hence it is that the <HI>Roman</HI> Poet says, <HI>Quisque suos patitur manes,</HI> every Man hath his evil <HI>Genius.</HI> And if we may believe
<PB N="222" REF="241"/>
the Authority of <HI>Plutarch,</HI> the evil <HI>Genius</HI> of <HI>Brutus</HI> appeared to him the Night before the Battle of <HI>Philippi,</HI> and told him he was his evil Genius, and that he would meet him there.</P>
<P>BUT there are greater Authorities then these in Vindication of this Opinion: <HI>Casalion</HI> ob∣serves, it may be proved from Scripture, and not only from the Tradition of the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Unicuique Deus custodem apposuit; &amp; asserimus in∣dubitanter nos ex scripturis illam fidem, non gentium nugibus. <HI>Cassal.</HI> 217. <HI>P. de Vet. Christ. Rit.</HI></NOTE> Hea∣thens. And of this Opinion was <HI>Justin Mar∣tyr, Theodoret,</HI> St. <HI>Basil,</HI> St. <HI>Jerome,</HI> and St. <HI>Austin.</HI></P>
<P>THERE are indeed two Places in the new Testament, which have a View to this Opini∣on. The first is in the 18th of St. <HI>Matthew,</HI> the 10th Verse, <HI>Take heed that ye despise not one of these little Ones: For I say unto you, that their Angels do always behold the face of my Father which is in Heaven.</HI> Now because this Place takes notice of the Angels of these little Ones, some have therefore concluded that
<PB N="223" REF="242"/>
every Man has his good Angel; at least that good Men have. But now this Conclusion does not certainly follow from these Words: For when it is said <HI>their Angels,</HI> it does indeed certainly infer, that the Angels do protect good Men, but not that every Man has his particular Angel. And hence therefore, as one observes, St. <HI>Chrisostom</HI> makes use of these Words, <HI>Enteuthen delon,</HI> &amp;c. it is manifest that the Saints at least, if not all Men, have their Angels: But he does not hence conclude, that every Man has one. The other Place is in the <HI>Acts of the Apostles,</HI> where it is said, that when <HI>Peter</HI> was delivered out of Prison, they would not believe the Maid it was he, but said, <HI>It was his Angel.</HI> It must be own'd in∣deed from this, that it seems the Opinion of those in the House, that every Man had his <HI>Guardian Angel;</HI> but this is no Proof of the Things being so: It only proves, that it was their Opinion, but not that this Opinion is true. The <HI>Jews</HI> had such a <HI>Tradition</HI> among them, and what was here spoken, was perhaps only according to that Tradition. Besides we read on the contrary, that sometimes one and
<PB N="224" REF="243"/>
the same Angel has been sent to different Per∣sons; thus <HI>Gabriel</HI> was sent to <HI>Daniel, Zacha∣rias,</HI> and the blessed Virgin: Sometimes the Scripture tells us of many Angels protecting one Man; for so was <HI>Elisha</HI> protected; and as we wrestle <HI>not only against Flesh and Blood, but against all the Powers of Darkness,</HI> so we have many Angels to assist and defend us. I shall not dare to determine positively against this Opinion, which has travelled down through so many Ages, which has been held by so many wise and learned Men, and which has such Scriptures brought to its Defence; this I shall only say, that of the two Opinions, the Latter seems to be the more probable; that it seems more consonant to Scripture, that we are attended by a Number of Angels, than by a particular <HI>Tutelar Angel.</HI> But this I menti∣on, not as necessary to be believed. For I am perswaded there is no fault in believing either the one or the other, as it appears more pro∣bable: For whether soever we believe, we be∣lieve in the Protection of Angels, and that seems to be all which the Scripture requires.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XXX.</HI> Of the Country Wake: How observed formerly: A Custom of the Heathens, and regulated by <HI>Gregory</HI> the Great.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>N the Southern Parts of this Nati∣on, the most of Country Villages are wont to observe some Sunday in a more particular Manner, than the other common Sundays of the Year, <HI>viz.</HI> the Sunday after the <HI>Day of Dedication,</HI> i. e. the Sunday after the <HI>Day of the Saint,</HI> to whom their Church was dedicated. Then the Inhabitants deck themselves in their gaudiest Clothes, and have open Doors and splendid Entertainments, for the Reception and Treating of their Relations and Friends, who visit them on that Occasion, from each neighbouring Town. The Morn∣ing is spent for the most Part at Church, tho' not as that Morning was wont to be spent, not
<PB N="226" REF="245"/>
with the Commemoration of the <HI>Saint or Mar∣tyr,</HI> nor the grateful Remembrance of the <HI>Buil∣der and Endower.</HI> The remaining Part of the Day, is spent in Eating and Drinking; and so is also a Day or two afterwards, together with all Sorts of Rural Pastimes and Exercises, such as <HI>Dancing on the Green, Wrestling, Cudgelling,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>AGREEABLE to this we are told, that formerly <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Die Dominicâ post Encaeniam seu Festum Dedicati∣onis cujusvis villae convenire solet in Aurorâ Magna ho∣minum Iuvenumque multitudo, &amp; canora voce <HI>Holy-wakes, Holy-makes,</HI> Exclamando Designare, <HI>&amp;c. Spelm. Gloss. in Verb. Wak.</HI></NOTE> on the Sunday after the <HI>Encaenia,</HI> or <HI>Feast of the Dedication</HI> of the Church, it was usual for a great Number of the Inhabitants of the Village, both Grown and Young, to meet together about break of Day, and cry, <HI>Holy-wakes, Holy-wakes,</HI> and after <HI>Mattens</HI> to go to Feasting and Sporting, which they continu'd for two or three Days.</P>
<P>IN the <HI>Northren Parts,</HI> the Sunday's Feast∣ing is almost lost, and they observe only one other Day for the whole, which among them is called the <HI>Hopping;</HI> I suppose from the dan∣cing
<PB N="227" REF="246"/>
and other Exercises then used. The an∣cient Name, and which is still common in the Southern Parts, is the <HI>Wake;</HI> which according to Sir <HI>H. Spelman,</HI> are <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sunt celebritates Bacchanales sub fructuum tempori∣bus, ab occiduiis &amp; Borealibus Anglis pagatim Habitae. Bacchanales dixi ex nomine: Nam Wak. Sax est temul∣entia. <HI>Spelm. ibid.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Bacchanal</HI> Feasts, ob∣served about Fruit Time, and which were in Villages by Turns, among the Northern and Western <HI>English.</HI> He calls them <HI>Bacchanals,</HI> because, as he observes, the <HI>Saxon</HI> Word <HI>Wak,</HI> signifies Drunkenness. This Custom our Fore∣fathers did in all Probability borrow from their Fellow Heathens, <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Haec eadem sunt quae apud Ethnicos Paganalia dice∣bantur, <HI>&amp;c. Spelm. ibid.</HI></NOTE> whose <HI>Paganalia,</HI> or <HI>Coun∣try Feasts,</HI> were of the same Stamp, with this of the <HI>Wake.</HI></P>
<P>AT the Conversion of the <HI>Saxons</HI> by <HI>Austin the Monk,</HI> it was continu'd among the Con∣verts, with some Regulations, by an Order of <HI>Pope</HI> Gregory <HI>the Great,</HI> to <HI>Mellitus</HI> the Abbot, who accompany'd <HI>Austin</HI> in his Voyage. His Words are these, <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Ut Die Dedicationis, vel Natalitiis Sanctorum Martyr∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>um, quorum illic reliquiae ponuntur, tabernacula sibi circa easdem Ecclesias, quae ex Fanis commutatae sunt, de ramis arborum faciant, <HI>&amp;c.

or the Birth-Day of the Holy Martyrs, whose Relicks are there placed, let the People make to themselves <HI>Booths</HI> of the Boughs of Trees, round about those very Churches, which had been the Temples of Idols, and in a Religious way to observe a Feast; that Beasts may no longer be slaughtered by way of Sacrifice to the Devil, but for their own Eating, and the Glory of GOD; and that when they are full and satisfied, they may return him Thanks, who is the Giver of all good Things.</P>
<P>THIS then is the Beginning of our <HI>Country Wakes,</HI> but they continu'd not in their original Purity: For the Feasting and Sporting got the ascendant of Religion, and so this <HI>Feast of De∣dication,</HI> degenerated into Drunkenness and Lux∣ury. At present there is nothing left but the very Refuse and Dregs of it; Religion having not the least Share in it, which till these latter Ages always had some. Rioting and Feasting are now all that remain, a Scandal to the Feast in particular, and to Christianity in general.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XXXI.</HI> Of the Harvest Supper: A Custom of the Heathens, taken from the <HI>Jewish</HI> Feast of Tabernacles.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">W</SEG>HEN the Fruits of the Earth are gather'd in, and laid in their proper Receptacles, it is common, in the most of Country Places, to provide a plentiful Supper for the <HI>Harvest-Men,</HI> and the Servants of the Family; which is called a <HI>Har∣vest-Supper,</HI> and in some Places a <HI>Mell-Supper,</HI> a <HI>Churn Supper,</HI> &amp;c. At this the Servant and his Master are alike, and every Thing is done with an equal Freedom. They sit at the same Table, converse freely together, and spend the remaining Part of the Night in dancing, sing∣ing, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> without any Difference or Distinction.</P>
<P><PB N="230" REF="249"/>THERE <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Antiquitus consuetudo fuit apud <HI>Gentiles,</HI> quod hoc mense servi pastores &amp; ancillae quadam libertate frueren∣tur: Et cum Dominis suis Dominarentur, &amp; cum eis fa∣cerent festa, &amp; convivia, post Collectas Messes. <HI>Durand.

Lib.</HI> 6. <HI>Cap.</HI> 86.</NOTE> was a Custom among the Hea∣thens, much like this, at the gathering in of their Harvest, when Servants were indulg'd with Liberty and being on the Equality with their Masters for a certain Time.</P>
<P>NOW the Original of both these Customs, is <HI>Jewish:</HI> And therefore <HI>Hospinian</HI> tells us, <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Et pro collectis frugibus Deo gratiae agebantur. Quem morem Ethnici postea abiis mutuati sunt. <HI>Hospin. de Orig. Fest. Jud. Stukius Antiq. Convival.</HI> P. 63.</NOTE> That the Heathens copy'd after this Custom of the <HI>Jews,</HI> and at the End of their Harvest, offer'd up their first Fruits to the Gods. For the <HI>Jews</HI> rejoyced and feasted at the getting in of the Harvest.</P>
<P><HI>THEOPHYLACT</HI> in talking of this Feast, is undoubtedly mistaken, when he says, <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Scenopegia, quod Celebrant in Gratiarum Actionem propter convectas Fruges in Mense <HI>Septembri.</HI> Tunc e∣nim gratias agebant Deo, convectis omnibus fructibus, <HI>&amp;c. Theophylact. in</HI> 7 <HI>Cap. Joan.</HI></NOTE> That the <HI>Feast of Tabernacles</HI> was celebrated, that
<PB N="231" REF="250"/>
Thanks might be returned for the getting in of the Fruits of the Earth. For GOD himself tells his own People, it was instituted, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Levit. 23.—</NOTE> <HI>that their Generations might know, that he had made the Children of</HI> Israel <HI>to dwell in Booths.</HI> But however, it is certainly true, that it was a Time of returning Thanks to GOD, for the Success of the Harvest, a Time of Festivity, and Joy and Gladness, Thus the Scripture, <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Deut. 16.</NOTE> <HI>Thou shalt observe the Feast of Tabernacles seven Days, after thou hast gather'd in thy Corn and thy Wine. And thou shalt rejoyce in thy Feast, thou and thy Son and thy Daughter, and thy Man-Servant, and thy Maid-Servant; and the Levite, the Stranger, and the Fatherless and the Widow, that are within thy Gates.</HI></P>
<P>NOW as the Heathens have imitated the <HI>Jews</HI> in this Custom, so it is not improbable that we have had it from the <HI>Heathens;</HI> there being a very great Likeness between the Cu∣stom now, and that of the Heathens formerly.
<PB N="232" REF="251"/>
For <HI>Macrobius</HI> tells us, That <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Patres Familiarum &amp; frugibus &amp; fructibus jam Coac∣tis, passim cum servis vescerentur, cum quibus patientiam Laboris ia colendo rure toleraverant. <HI>Macrob.
