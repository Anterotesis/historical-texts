<P>LETTERS TO PARTICULAR FRIENDS,</P>
<P>BY WILLIAM SHENSTONE, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> From the Year 1739 to
1763.</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THOUGH the Character of Mr. <HI>Shenstone,</HI> is too well
known, and his reputation as a Writer too firmly established, to require
any further commendation, yet it may perhaps be expected that some apology
should be made for this volume of his Works, containing Familiar Letters to
some of his most intimate Friends.</P>
<P>To these who may think such an apology re∣quisite, it might
be sufficient to say, that the reception which the former volumes have met
with, affords the strongest reason to believe that an addition to them
would be very accepta∣ble to the Public; and that the author's talent in
<HI>epistolary</HI> writing appears not to have been inferior to that which
distinguishes his other compositions.</P>
<P>But it may be objected, that, whatever their merit may be,
<HI>Letters,</HI> not intended for the Public, ought not to be published, and
that an act of this kind is a violation of private friendship.</P>
<P>This objection, it must be confessed, carries with it such
an air of delicacy, that the persons here concerned are very willing to give
it all due attention. At the same time they cannot but observe, that it
will not hold in all cases, and therefore must unavoidably be subject to
some limitations—that these limitations must <PB N="iv" REF="3"/>
vary, as the circumstances of cases happen to vary—and that not to
make proper allowances for such circumstances is highly
unreasonable—injurious to many who have deserved well of the Public
by this very conduct, and detrimen∣tal to the interests of Literature. It
might perhaps be difficult, and is by no means necessa∣ry, to enumerate
these several limitations. It will be sufficient in this place to say,
that where neither the reputation of the Writer, nor that of any other
person, is injured, there the force of the objection evidently ceases. And
it is not only believed, on the most mature deliberation, that this is the
case in the present instance; but moreover that the there are posi∣tive
good reasons in its favour, respecting as well the Writer's character in
this <HI>species</HI> of compo∣sition, as the satisfaction and
entertainment of the Reader.</P>
<P>The encouragement which has been usually given to Works of this
nature might seem to make these observations unnecessary! But it was
not thought sufficient barely to shelter this publication under the
sanction of such an autho∣rity; as it is well known that the wantonness
of curiosity has sometimes encouraged design by no means
justifiable:—and it is as readily acknowledged that the following
Letters are deficient in many particulars requisite to excite that
curiosity, being neither written on popular subjects, nor addressed to
persons of rank and eminence in the world. They will not fail how∣ever to
afford an agreeable entertainment to such as can relish an animated
display of the various efforts of a fine imagination for a length of years,
whether amusing itself with <PB N="v" REF="4"/> rural embellishments, or
occupied in other plea∣sures of learned retirement, and a warm
disin∣terested friendship. Such are the subjects of the following
Letters! and if any person should still retain a doubt concerning the
propriety of perpetuating them in this manner, he shall be finally referred
to the writer's own authority, who, in a letter dated October, 23, 1754, thus
expresses himself:</P>
<Q>I confess to you that I am considerably mortified by Mr.
W—'s conduct in regard to those Letters (meaning his own letters to
that gentleman's brother;) and, rather than they should have been so
unnecessarily destroyed, would have given more money than it is
allowa∣ble for me to mention with decency. I look upon my letters as some of
my <HI>chef-d'aeuvres</HI>; and could I be supposed to have the
smallest pre∣tensions to propriety of style or sentiment, I should
imagine it must appear principally in my Letters to his brother, and one or
two more friends. I consider them as the records of a friendship that will
be alway dear to me, and as the history of my mind for these twenty years
past.</Q>
<P>When it is considered how seldom so valuable a collection of
real correspondence is to be met with, and how difficult it is to supply
the want of it by a fictitious one, it cannot be doubted that the Public will
be pleased to see the loss here complained of so well repaired, and to
be furnished with such genuine examples of the Author's style and
sentiments, together with an authentic history of his mind, for so long a
space of time.</P>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="5"/>To conclude: The talents of this Author, on
whatever subject they were exercised, were so uncommon, and the fame of
his little <HI>Ferme ornée,</HI> under the conduct of a taste entirely
original, was become so considerable, that every specimen of the one, and
every anecdote relative to the improvement of the other, seemed too
interesting to be buried in oblivion: at least, they were thought so by
those to whom the <HI>greater</HI> part of this Collection is
addressed:—persons indeed confessedly partial to the Writer's
talents, and interested in his commendations; but at the same time
persons neither so regard∣less of their Friend's reputation, nor their
own, as to have hazarded either, without the strong∣est persuasion that
their partiality had not im∣posed upon their judgement; and that it was no
indecent ostentation in them, by this public act, to testify, that they
esteemed it not only a peculiar felicity in their fortunes, but likewise
some degree of credit, to have enjoyed the plea∣sures of such a
friendship throughout so consi∣derable a period of human life.</P>

<SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS my head is considerably more confused than usual, by
reason of a bad cold, I shall aim no higher in this letter than at bare
<HI>recitative,</HI> reserving all my <HI>airs</HI> for a season when my
mind is more in <HI>tune.</HI> Such, I hope, will be the time which you set
apart to attend the <HI>chief musician,</HI> at Birmingham. I thoroughly
design to lend an <HI>ear</HI> to <HI>his</HI> performance, on con∣dition he
will not refuse one to a proposal I in∣tend to make, of having, one day or
other, a merry strain at the Leasows. But if you have any <HI>penchant</HI>
to see the face of your humble servant at Birmingham, your most effectual
way will be to inform him when these solemn nup∣tials betwixt Tweedle-dum
and Tweedle-dee are to be consummated. I will, <HI>certes,</HI> not be
absent at the throwing of the stocking, any more than <PB N="2" REF="13"/>
Parson Evans in Shakespeare would be 
<Q REND="inline">"absence at the grace."</Q> I have sent a
song, not that I am sure I have not sent it before; but that, if you can
see any joke that it containeth, the forementioned gentleman may be asked
to tran∣slate it into music. When I use this expression, you will,
peradventure, look upon it as my opinion, that in musical compositions,
sound ought as much to answer sense as one language does another,
insomuch, that such and such thoughts ought to bring into our heads
such and such sounds, and <HI>vice versa.</HI> But in case there is
no sense, and no thought, the more languages a sentence is translated
into, the more 'tis expo∣sed. And in case it be the misfortune of my little
piece to have neither, I beg that Mr. Mar∣riett may not inform any body what it
signifies in music. As a farther proof of the confused state of my
intellects, you see, almost at the end of my letter, my thanks for the
packet, &amp;c. which ought to have been placed in the very front of it, in
order to express, in some degree, the sense I have of your favours. I
long to see you; and am, dear Sir,</P>

<P>WELL! and so I sate me down in my <HI>room,</HI> and was reading
<HI>Pamela</HI>—one might furnish this book with several pretty
decorations, thought I to myself; and then I began to design cuts for it,
in particular places. For instance, one, where Pamela is forced to fall upon
her knees in the arbor: a second, where she is in bed, and Mrs. Jewkes
holds one hand, and Mr. B. the other: a third, where Pamela sits sew∣ing in
the summer-house, &amp;c. So I just sketched them out, and sent my
little hints, such as they were, to Mr. R—n. As soon as I had
sealed my letter, in comes Mrs. Arnold<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">His
house-keeper, of whom very respectful mention is made in the course of
this correspondence.</NOTE>—
<Q REND="inline">"Well, Mrs. Arnold," says I, "this Mr. Jago never
comes—what can one do? I'm as dull as a beetle for want of company."</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">"Sir," says she, "the hen"—</Q>
<Q REND="inline">"What makes you out of breath," <PB N="4" REF="15"/>
says I, "Mrs. Arnold, what's the matter?"—</Q>
<Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir," says she, "the hen I set last
sab∣bath-day-was-three-weeks has just hatched, and has brought out all her
eggs to good."—</Q>
<Q REND="inline">"That's brave indeed," says I.</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">"Ay, that it is," says she, "so be and't
please G—d an how that they liven, there'll be a glorious parcel of
'em. Shall I bring 'em up for you to see?" says she.</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">"No, thank ye, Mrs. Arnold," says I; "but aren't
ye in some apprehensions from the kite, Mrs. Arnold?"—</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">"No, Sir," says she; "I hope there's no danger;
I <HI>takes</HI> pretty good care of 'em."</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">"I don't question your care," says I; "for
you're seldom without a duck or a chicken about you."—</Q>
<Q REND="inline">"Poor pretty <HI>creters,</HI>" says she; "look
here, Master, this has gotten a speck of black upon her tail."—</Q>
<Q REND="inline">"Ay, I thought you wern't without one about you,"
says I: "I don't think," says I, "Mrs. Arnold, but your soul was
design'd for a hen originally."</Q> 
<Q REND="inline"> "Why, and if I <HI>had</HI> been a hen," says
she, "I believe I should have done as much for my chickens as yonder great
black-and-white hen does, tho' I say't that should not say't," says
she.</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">"Ay, that you would," thought I. "Well, but now when
Jago comes, have you got e'er a chicken that's <HI>fit to kill?</HI></Q> 
<Q REND="inline">"No." says she, "I doubt there is
ne'er-a-one."</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">"Well," says I, "Mrs. Arnold, you and your chicken
may go down; I am going to write a letter."</Q> So I sat down, and wrote thus
far: scrattle, scrattle, goes the pen—why how now? says
I—what<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s the mat∣ter with the
pen? So I thought I would make an end of my letter, because my pen went
scratle, scrattle. Well, I warrant I shall have little plea, sure when
Mr. Jago <HI>comes</HI>; for I never fixed my heart upon any thing in my life,
but some misfor∣tune happened to balance my pleasure.—After all,
thought I, it must be some very ill accident that outweighs the pleasure
I shall take in seeing him.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>1739.</DATE></DATELINE> 
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I CANNOT avoid imagining the first part of your letter was mere
raillery. I am sure it gave me a good deal of pleasure (for I can bear very
well to hear my foibles exposed, though not my faults) and on that account
must needs make grateful mention of it. I acknowledge the oddness of the
letter which occasioned it, and could not expect that such an ill-formed
appli∣cation could have produced an answer so very oratorical. In the
first place, you lay open the subject, or indeed, what you call the offices
in which I am pleased to employ you. In the next, you alledge your own
inability to enter upon matters of such great concernment. That this is
rhetorical, nay, pure rhetoric, I gather from the exordiums of all the
declamations that I ever heard in my life. 'Tis, moreover, not uncommon with
declaimers to give some reasons why they should not absolutely decline
the sub∣ject, though they are sensible of their insufficiency
(otherwise they might be expected to sit down, and hold their tongues.) And
this is what you have done, by saying that you are unwilling to dissent
from the world in regard to the subjects you are engaged in. That you,
therefore, chose to steer a middle course, by that means avoiding the
imputation of presumption on the one hand, and indifference on the other.
When this is done, you enter gravely upon the subject, and, to give it a
greater perspicuity, divide it into two parts. The first part happens to be

<Q REND="inline">"concerning the purchase of <HI>an</HI>
horse."</Q> On this occasion, you inform me, that I am in a good country
for horses; and, secondly, that I have a number of <PB N="6" REF="17"/>
acquaintance round about me, who are very well skilled in the nature of them.
Now each of these informations seems, at first sight, to mean no more
than what I have better opportunities of knowing than the person who informs
me, and, on this account, to err in point of super∣fluity. But, upon second
thoughts, they have <HI>this force</HI> (to speak like a grammarian) namely,
that I am entirely negligent of my own affairs; and, secondly, that I care
not whom I give trouble to, if I can but avoid it myself; so that the
senten∣ces have really a beauty, when one searches be∣neath their
superficies. After you have said this and more, which includes all that can
be said upon the subject, you descend to the second division, in
relation to which I am too grateful to be otherwise than <HI>seri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>us</HI> in my acknowledgments.</P>
<P>I had not expatiated thus far but to shew that I am not
insensible of a sneer; nor should I expa∣tiate any farther, but to
prove, that I am equally sensible of a favour.</P>
<P>I desire you would believe, that I absolutely assent to your
critique. That some of your sen∣timents were my own before I communicated
the verses; and others, as soon as you had favoured me with the discovery
of them. That I would, <HI>per praesentes,</HI> return my thanks for them;
which you might justly have claimed, whether I had approved them or not. One
exception to this approbation my modesty bids me mention, on account of your
too great partiality in my fa∣vour. My gratitude you are entitled to, without
exception or limitation.</P>
<P>It will, perhaps, gratify your curiosity to know, that Mr. G. has
a copy of verses in the last magazine, entitled, 
<Q REND="inline">"The little Cur."</Q> There are several strokes
that are picturesque and hu∣morous; I believe it was done in haste. The
motto is exquisite, and much more properly ap∣plied by Mr. G. than the
Emperor Adrian, in <PB N="7" REF="18"/> my opinion, notwithstanding all that
Pope says. Tell me your judgment of Mr. L—n's in the same paper. The
epigram 
<Q REND="inline">"To one who refused to walk in the Park,
&amp;c."</Q> is a good one.</P>
<P>I have waved sending the verses to Mr. Somer∣vile at present,
because I hope to see you soon either at the Leasows or at Birmingham.
I can't tell whether I shall have time to inclose in this letter my ballad.
If I do, consider it only as some words that I chuse to make use of to
some notes of which I am more than ordinarily fond<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The tune, 
<Q REND="inline">"Come and listen to my ditty, &amp;c."</Q> The
words sounded upon a true history of Queen Elizabeth, who, looking from a
castle, wherein she was a prisoner, and seeing a country milk-maid
singing, expressed great envy at the girl's condition, and
dissatisfaction with regard to her own.</NOTE>. It is as much designed
for my own singing (in private I mean) as ever was a bottle of cherry-brandy
for an old woman's drinking. Now I think of it, I really believe that I every
day approach nearer and nearer to the capacity, the way, the insignificancy,
of an old woman. Mrs. Arnold has certainly, by her <HI>charms,</HI> her
incantations, and her conversations together, contributed a good deal to this
transformation. Pray come over if you can, and try to reinstate me in my
right mind, in proportion to the soundness of which I shall be more and
more</P>

<SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I RETURN you my thanks, most heartily, for the poetical
resentment which you have shewn against my censurers, the
Riddle-masters. I have sent Mr. Somervile's verses and yours to Cave;
though I am ashamed to own I neglected it so long, that, I fear, he will
have no room for them this month. If you can extirpate false wit in a manner,
you will do no small service to the true: you do no small <HI>honour</HI>
to it, whether you extirpate the other or not.</P>
<P>You have heard of the motion; have heard, probably, all that I can
tell you of it. That it was ill-concerted; that it has done the opposition
great disservice; that the King is now confirmed in the opinion of Sir
Robert's honesty; that the younger Mr. Pitt's speech was the most admired
on the opposite side, and Sir R—t's on the court side; that they
did not leave the House till five in the morning; that Sir R—t and
P—y are so violent, that the Sp—r is con∣tinually calling them to
order; finally, that the affair has occasioned this print, which I address
to your curiosity merely, though the lines upon the Bishop are humourous
enough.—Now I men∣tion curiosity; do you take notice of the many quaint
contrivances made use of to catch people's n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tural inquisitiveness in the pamphlets, viz. 
<Q REND="inline">"Are these things so?"—"Yes, they
are."—"What then!"—"The devil of a story."—"Hoy,
boys."—"Up go we."—</Q>And a thousand others. What do you think
must be my expence, who love to pry into every thing of this kind? Why,
truly, one shilling. My company goes to George's Coffee-house, where, for
that small sub∣scription, I read all pamphlets under a three-shilling 
<PB N="9" REF="20"/> dimensions; and, indeed, any larger ones would not be fit
for coffee-house perusal.—Lord Dudley lent me two sermons, given
him at the House of Lords, which I read last night. In the first, there
are a great many deep animad∣versions delivered in a style that is
tolerable; in the other, there is as great a want of common English as there
is plenty of common observa∣tions. Have you seen the sermons on the
Mar∣tyrdom and on the Fast-day? If you read either, send for the first.
You'll find me degenerate from a gentle bard into a snarling critic, if my
poem does not please (you'll say I am no very candid one at present:) but
let its fate be what it will, I shall lay no small stress upon the
opi∣nion of some that have approved it. As it is at present <HI>in
keeping,</HI> it discovers no uncommon impudence, and runs no very great
risque; but who can answer for it, when it has the grace∣lessness to
<HI>come upon the town?—Ora pro nobis,</HI> must soon be my motto. It
virtues and faults will then be incapable of addition or diminu∣tion, and the
pious assistance of friends must—but I am no Roman
Catholic.—The intrinsic merit of a book when it is printed, as well as
the past life and conversation of a man that is departed, must damn, or
give it immortality—I mean, to a certain degree.—I scrible what
comes uppermost, and desire you would do the same.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>From Mr. Wintle's, Per∣fumer, near Temple-Bar,
&amp;c. 
<DATE>6th Feb. 1740.</DATE></DATELINE> 
<SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM now with regard to the <HI>town</HI> pretty much in the same
state in which I expect to be always with regard to the <HI>world</HI>;
sometimes exclaiming and railing against it; sometimes giv∣ing it a good
word, and even admiring it. A sun-shiny day, a tavern-supper after a play
well acted, and now and then an invigorating breath of air in the Mall, never
fail of producing a chearful effect. I don't know whether I gave you any
account of Quin's acting Falstaff in my former letter: I really imagined that
I saw you littering on one side me, shaking your sides, and sometimes
scarce containing yourself. You'll pardon the attitude in which I placed
you, since at was what seemed <HI>natural</HI> at that circumstance of
time. Comus I have once been at, for the sake of the songs, though I
detest it in any <HI>light:</HI> but as a <HI>dramatic</HI> piece the
<HI>taking</HI> of it seems a <HI>prodigy</HI>; yet indeed
<HI>such-a-one,</HI> as was pretty to∣lerably accounted for by a gentleman
who sate by me in the <HI>boxes.</HI> This learned sage, being asked how
he liked the play, made answer, 
<Q REND="inline">"He could not tell—pretty well, he
thought—or indeed as well as any other play—he always took it, that
people only came there to see and to be seen—for as for what was
said, he owned, he never understood any thing of the matter."</Q> I told
him, I thought a great many of its admirers were in his case, if they would
but own it.</P>
<P>On the other hand, it is amazing to consider to what an
universality of learning people make <PB N="11" REF="22"/> pretensions here.
There's not a drawer, a chair or hackney coach-man, but is politician, poet,
and judge of polite literature. Chimney-swee∣pers damn the Convention, and
black-shoe-boys cry up the genius of Shakespeare. 
<Q REND="inline">"The Dan∣ger of writing Verse"</Q> is a very good
thing; if you have not read it, I would recommend it to you as poetical. But
now I talk of learning, I must not omit an interview which I acciden∣tally
had the other night in company with Lord D— and one Mr. C—. We were
taken to sup at a private house, where I found a person whom I had never
seen before. The man behaved exceeding modestly and well; till, growing a
little merry over a bottle (and being a little countenanced by the subject we
were upon) he pulls out of his pocket about half a dozen ballads, and
distributes them amongst the com∣pany. I (not finding at first they were
of his own composition) read one over, and, finding it a dull piece of
stuff, contented myself with ob∣serving, that it was exceedingly well
<HI>printed.</HI> But to see the man's face on this occasion would make you
pity the circumstance of an author as long as you live. His jollity ceased
(as a flame would do, should you pour water upon it;) and, I be∣lieve, for
about five minutes, he spoke not a syllable. At length, recovering
himself, he be∣gan to talk about his country-seat, about Hough∣ton Hall,
and soon after desired a health, ima∣gining (as I found afterwards) that
Lord D— would have given Sir Robert's. But he did not, naming Sir
T— L—: mine, which followed, was that of Mr. L—. Now, who do
you think this should be, but honest Ralph Freeman (at least the writer
of the paper so subscribed) your father's old friend and intimate, Sir
Robert's right-hand, a person that lives elegantly, drives six of the
best horses in town, and plays on St. John's organ: (you know Mr. L— is
not <PB N="12" REF="23"/> only Sir Robert's greatest enemy, but the
Gazet∣teer's proper antagonist.) We were invited to see him very civilly,
and indeed the man behaved with the utmost good humour, without arro∣gance,
or any attempts at wit, which, probably, would not have been very
successful. Ask your father what he would say to me, if I should join
in the cause with his old friend, and take a good annuity under Sir Robert,
which, I be∣lieve, I might have; and little encouragement, God knows, have I
met with on the other side of the question. I say, I believe I <HI>might
have,</HI> because I know a certain person gives pensions of three pound
a week to porters and the most illi∣terate, stupid fellows you can imagine,
to talk in his behalf at ale-houses; where they fit so long a time, and are
as regularly relieved as one centry relieves another. At least tell him that
I expect in his answer to my letter (which I shall not allow him to
assign to you) he write some∣thing to confirm me in my integrity, and to
make me prefer him, and you, and honesty, to lace, brocade, and the smiles
of the ladies, 
<Q>Et Veneri, &amp; cunis, &amp; plumis Sardanapali.</Q> But I hope
to keep my Hercules in view, whe∣ther in print or manuscript; and though I am
as fond of pleasure as most people, yet I shall observe the rule, 
<Q>Positam sic tangere noli.</Q></P>
<P>I desire I may hear from you next post: I have a line or two,
which I intend for the <HI>sons of utter darkness</HI> (as you call them)
next maga∣zine: I would send them to you, for your advice, but cannot readily
find them. I like every thing in Mr. Somervile's, but the running of the last
line. I think to insert them. Should be glad <PB N="13" REF="24"/> to have a
line or two of <HI>yours,</HI> that one may make a bold attack. I look on it as

<P>I HEARTILY thank you for the service your letter did me. And a
considerable ser∣vice, no doubt, it <HI>is,</HI> to raise the spirits
of a person so habitually dispirited as I have been for some time. For
this, and all former favours, as the sullen fellow says in Shakespeare, 
<Q REND="inline">"I thank you; I am not of many words, but I thank
you."</Q></P>
<P>I beg you would cease to apologize for your letters: in the
first place, it will lay <HI>me</HI> under a necessity of doing
<HI>so</HI>; and, in the next place, you may be assured, that no friendly
letter of yours will ever be otherwise than infinitely agree∣able to me.</P>
<P>I sent a letter to Mr. Marriett at Bath, to be left with you at
your former place of residence; you will be so kind as to give it to
him.</P>
<P>If I wish for a <HI>large</HI> fortune, it is rather for the
sake of my friends than myself: or, to com∣promise the matter with
those moralists who <PB N="14" REF="25"/> argue for the universality of
<HI>self-interest,</HI> it is to gratify myself in the company, and in
the gra∣tifications, of my friends.</P>
<P>Dr. Ratcliff has sent me a letter, which gives me much
<HI>satisfaction</HI> in respect of my poem; notwithstanding, he cannot
forbear adding, that he expects to hear, since my pen has so well adorned
the fable, that my conduct will, with equal propriety and elegance,
illustrate the moral. However, the simple approbation of a
<HI>sincere</HI> man affects one more, than Pliny's panegyric could do, from
a more courtly one.</P>
<P>There are several errors of the press, which neither sagacity
nor vigilance itself, I now see, can prevent, and which I beg you to
correct with your pen, in a copy which I must get you to present to
C— L—, together with the inclosed letter. Please to be at the
expence of having it stitched in purple paper, and gilt at the edges; and I
will repay you.</P>
<P>I was loitering yesterday in the coffee-room, when two persons
came in, well-dressed, and called for my poem; read a page or two, and
commended the four lines upon Mr. L— ex∣tremely; 
<Q REND="inline">("Lov'd by that prince, &amp;c.")</Q> repeated them
forty times, and, in the end, got them by heart, mentioned them to a
<HI>third</HI> person, who said he knew of no virtue that the prince
<HI>was</HI> fired with, and then endeavoured to mimic the prince's way of
talking; but, says he, <HI>I'll</HI> shew <HI>the four best lines in the
poem, and then proceeded to</HI> 
<Q REND="inline">"'Twas youth's perplexing stage, &amp;c."</Q>
which are flat enough, God knows—but to my first heroes; one of them
reads, 
<Q REND="inline">"When great Alci∣des to a grove retir'd."</Q>
<HI>Ay, ay, you know Mr. L— did retire, he was in the secession;
read on; you'll find he mentions Delia anon. Don't you remember Mr. L— wrote
a song upon Delia? but proceed—you'll find he is going to give a
description of two ladies, of different characters, that were in</HI> 
<PB N="15" REF="26"/> <HI>love with Mr. L—. One was</HI> (here he named
two names, which I have forgot.) <HI>Upon my word, it is fine: I believe it is
Pope's;—but how comes Pope to praise himself there?</HI> 
<Q REND="inline">("Lov'd by that bard, &amp;c.")</Q> <HI>No doubt,
however, it was written by Mr. Pope, or Mr D—.</HI></P>
<P>My critics proceeded to the reading of the last simile
<HI>immediately, without</HI> the lines preced∣ing it, and, agreeing that it
was a very good thing, called out for 
<Q REND="inline">"The Oeconomy of Love."</Q> So you see, 
<Q REND="inline">"Laudant <HI>illa,</HI> sed <HI>ista</HI>

approbation of such critics, or else I would not have inserted such a
<HI>commendatory</HI> paragraph. I never enquire how my poem takes, and am
<HI>afraid</HI> to do so.—However, I find <HI>some do</HI> allow it
to be <HI>Mallet</HI>'s.—I am impatient till I hear from you: I shall

<SALUTE>Dear Mr. Jago,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I FIND some difficulty in writing to you on this melancholy
occasion. No one can be more unfit to attempt to lessen your grief than
myself, because no one has a deeper sense of the <HI>cause</HI> of
your affliction. Though I would by no means be numbered by you amongst the
common herd of your acquaintance, that tell you they are sorry, yet it were
impertinent in me to mention a mere friend's concern to a person interested
by so many more tender regards. Beside, I should be glad to alleviate
your sorrow, and such fort of condolence tends but little to promote that
end. I do not chuse to flatter you; neither could I, more especially at
this time; but though I could perhaps find enough to say to persons of
less sense than you, I know of nothing but what your own reason must
have suggested. Concern indeed may have suspended the power of that
faculty; and upon that pretence I have a few things that I would suggest to
you. After all, it is time alone, that <HI>can</HI> and <HI>will</HI> cure
<HI>all</HI> afflictions, but such as are the consequence of vice; and
your's, I am sure, proceeds from a <HI>contrary</HI> principle.</P>
<P>I heard accidentally of this sorrowful event, and accompanied you
to London with the umost concern. I wished it was in my power to miti∣gate
your griefs by sharing them, as I have often found it in yours to augment my
pleasures by so doing.</P>
<P>All that I can recommend to you is, not to confine your eye to any
single event in life, but to take in your whole circumstances before you
repine.</P>
<P>When you reflect that you have lost one of the best of men in a
father, you ought to com∣fort <PB N="17" REF="28"/> yourself that you had
such a father; to whom I cannot forbear applying these lines from Milton: 
<Q>

can.—I will endeavour to render the time you spend <HI>here</HI> as
satisfactory as it is in my power; and I hope you will ever look upon me as
your hearty friend, through all the vissitudes of life.</P>

<SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WONDERFUL were the dangers and difficulties through which I went,
the night I left you at Barels; which I looked upon as ordained by fate for the
temporal punishment of obstinacy. It was very kind, and in charac∣ter for
you to endeavour to deter me from the ways of darkness; but having a sort
of <HI>penchant</HI> for needless difficulties, I have an undoubted right to
indulge myself in them, so long as I do <PB N="18" REF="29"/> not insist
upon any one's pity. It is true, these ought not to exceed a certain degree;
they should be <HI>lenia tormenta</HI>; and I must own the labours I
underwent that night, did not come within the bounds which my imagination had
prescribed. I cannot forbear mentioning one imminent danger.—I rode
along a considerable piece of water covered so close with trees, that it
was as probable I might have pursued the channel, which was dangerous, as my
way out of it. Or, to put my case in a more poetical light, having by night
intruded upon an amour betwixt a Wood-nymph and a River-god, I owed my escape
to Fortune, who conveyed me from the vengeance which they might have taken. I
put up finally at a little alehouse about ten o'clock, and lay all night
awake, counting the cords which supported me, which I could more safely
swear to than to either bed or blanket. For farther particulars, see my
epistle to the Pastor Fido of Lapworth.—Mr. Graves says, he
should be glad to shew you any civilities in his power, upon his own
acquaintance; and will serve you as far as his vote goes, upon my
re∣commendation; but is afraid, without the con∣currence of some more
considerable friends, your chance will be but small <HI>this</HI> year,
&amp;c. If the former part of this news gives you any pleasure, I assure
you it gives me no less to communicate it; and this pleasure proceeds from
a principle which would induce me to serve you myself, if it should ever
be in my power.—I saw Mr. Lyttleton last week: he is a candidate for
the county of Worcester, together with Lord Deer∣hurst; I hope Mr.
Somervile will do him the honour to appear as his friend, which he must at
least think second to that of succeeding.</P>
<P>I hear you are commenced chaplain since I saw you. I wish you
joy of it. The chaplain's title is infinitely more agreeable than his office; 
<PB N="19" REF="30"/> and I hope the scarf, which is expressive of it,
will be no diminutive thing, no fourpenny-half∣penny piece of ribboning; but
that it will 
<Q> 
<L>High o'er the neck its rustling folds display,</L> 
<L>Disdain all usual bounds, extend its sway,</L> 
<L>Usurp the head, and push the wig away.</L></Q></P>
<P>I hope it will prove ominous, that my first letter is a

such, it would entirely quadrate with the sincere wishes of</P>

<P>I THANK you for the favour of your last letter, particularly your
readiness in trans∣mitting to me any thing of Mr. Somervile's. It so fell
out, that Mr. Outing delivered to me the verses, and I had the pleasure of
reading them about a moment before he gave me your epistle.</P>
<P>The town expected something of importance, namely, a motion for a
committee of enquiry into late measures, would be moved for to day. If any
thing of this nature has been carried on, I will add an account of it before I
close my letter. In the mean time, it is, I believe, very credible, that Lord

the resignation of his posts again.</P>

that had just learnt that Hor W 's gentleman's name was Jackson, writes a

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR last letter gave me a good deal of uneasiness, in rgard
to Mr. Somervile's indisposition. I hope, if he is better, you will omit no
opportunity of gratifying me with the news of it. I shall be glad to employ
you and Mr. Jago in my little rivulet before winter comes, <PB N="22" REF="33"/>
when one must bid adieu to rural beauties. Those charming scenes, which
the poets, in order to render them more compleat, have furnished with ladies,
must be stript of all their ornaments. Those incomparable nymphs, the
Dryads and the Nereids, which have been my constant com∣panions this short
summer, will vanish to more pleasing climes; and I must be left to
seek my assistance in real beauties, instead of imaginary ones. In
short, I am thinking to live part of this winter in Worcester, or some
other town. I was at a concert there, a very full one, lately. I observed Dr.
Mackenzie talking to Mr. Lyt∣tleton; and I hope, on that account, he is in his
interest; otherwise Mr. Somervile would do Mr. Lyttleton great service by
engaging him.—Mr. Lyttleton took occasion to mention to me, the
obligation he lay under to Mr. Somervile for his letter, as well as his other
designs in his fa∣vour—that he had long received great pleasure from
that gentleman's pen, and wished for the honour of his acquaintance. I told
him, I be∣lieved the satisfaction would be mutual, or to that purpose. He
added, that the Chace was an <HI>extremely</HI> beautiful poem, the best by
far ever written on the subject. But now the fiddles squeaked, the
harpsichord jingled, and the per∣formers began to feel the divine
enthusiasm. The god of music invaded them as he did the Sibyll of old: 
<Q> 
<L>Deus, ecce Deus! cui talia fanti</L>

<SALUTE>Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU see I am <HI>extremely expeditious</HI> in an∣swering your
letter; the reason of which is a very powerful one, namely, the information
which I received last night, that it would be agreeable to you I should do
so. Please, there∣fore, to set aside the sum of eighteen pence, or
thereabouts, for letters which you will receive whilst I am in London; and,
to make it seem the less profusely squandered, consider it amongst
any other casual expences which you carelessly submit to, merely to
gratify your curiosity.</P>
<P>I went the other night, with the greatest ex∣pectations, to see 
<Q REND="inline">"The Merry Wives of Wind∣sor"</Q> performed at
Covent-Garden. It is im∣possible to express how much every thing fell
below my ideas. But I have <HI>considered since</HI>; and I find, that my
expectations were really more unjust than their manner of acting.
<HI>Persons,</HI> in order to act well, should have something of the
author's fire, as well as a polite education. And what makes this the clearer
to me is, that you hear ten plays well read by gentlemen in compa∣ny, to one
that you find well performed upon the stage.—Nothing can be more
ignorant or affected than the scornful airs which some peo∣ple give
themselves at a country play; because, forsooth, they have seen plays
in town. The truth is, the chief advantage of plays in town lies entirely in
the scenery. You seldom observe a set of strollers without one or two
actors who are quite equal to their parts; and I really know of no good one, at
either of the two Theatres Royal, except Cibber, who rarely acts, and Mrs.
Olive, I will add one more, in <HI>compliance</HI> with my <HI>own</HI> taste
<HI>merely,</HI> and that is Mr. Neal, a <PB N="24" REF="35"/> fellow who, by
<HI>playing the fool,</HI> has gained my particular <HI>esteem.</HI></P>
<P>After the play, we had an <HI>entertainment</HI>;—falsely
so called! It was that of Orpheus and Eurydice, the most
<HI>un-musical</HI> thing I ever heard, and which lasted, I believe, three
hours, with some intermixtures of Harlequin; both so dull, and yet heard
with patience, that I was amazed, astonished, confounded; but really a
<HI>man</HI> of <HI>sense</HI> ought not to be so; because they were
not calculated for <HI>him.</HI></P>
<P>I want you here extremely;—pray come up for a week. I
suppose you will not, so I will not argue superfluously. However,
write soon; and believe that your letters are the most agree∣able things in
the world to, Sir,</P>

<SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS I have no sort of library in town, I find several minutes
upon my hands, for which, if I employ them in scribling to my friends, they
are but <HI>slenderly obliged</HI> to me. I hope no friend of mine will ever
be induced, by my <HI>ex∣ample,</HI> to do any thing but avoid it; I believe no
one breathing can say, with more truth, 
<Q REND="inline">"Video meliora, &amp;c."</Q> It is not from a
spirit of jealousy that I would advise my acquaintance to seek
happiness in the regular path of a fixed life. But, though I very highly
approve of it, and envy it, my particular turn of mind would be as little
satisfied with it, as it is like to be a <HI>dif∣ferent</HI> one. Yet,
however I <HI>complain,</HI> I must <PB N="25" REF="36"/> own, I have a good
deal reconciled myself to this mixture of gratification and disappointment,
which must be my lot, till the last totally pre∣vails.</P>
<P>YET, after all, to tell you the truth, I am not pleased with being
advised to retire. I was say∣ing the other day to Mr. Outing, that I
<HI>had</HI> been ambitious more than I was at present, and that I grew
less so every day. Upon this he chimed in with me, and approved my
despon∣dency; saying, 
<Q REND="inline">"that <HI>he</HI> also had been ambiti∣ous, but
found it would not do."</Q> Do you think I lik'd him much for
this?—no—I wheeled about and said, 
<Q REND="inline">"I did not think with him; for I should always
find myself whetted by disap∣pointments, and more violent in proportion to
the intricacy of the game."</Q> I spent a night with him and Mr. Meredith,
and with him and Mr. Dean: in the latter party he had laid his hand upon his
sword six times, and <HI>threatened to put a dozen men to death,</HI> one
of which was Broughton the prize-fighter.—Mr. Whistler's company
seldom <HI>relieves</HI> me on an evening; and I go to plays but
<HI>seldom,</HI> because I intend no more to <HI>give countenance</HI> to
the <HI>pit.</HI>—I have got a belt!!! which distinguishes me as much
as a <HI>garter</HI>—it captivates the eyes of all beholders, and binds
their understanding in golden bandage.—I heard a pedant punning upon
the word <GAP DESC="foreign" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>; and a wag whispering that I was
re∣lated to <HI>Beltishazzar.</HI> In short, I may say, from the Dragon
of Wantley, 
<Q> 
<L>No girdle, nor belt, e'er excell'd it;</L> 
<L>It frightens the men in a minute;</L> 
<L>No maiden yet ever beheld it,</L> 
<L>But wish'd herself tied to me in it.</L></Q></P>
<P>THE Dunciad is, doubtless, Mr. Pope's do∣tage,
<GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>; slat in the whole, and
in∣cluding, <PB N="26" REF="37"/> with severable tolerable lines, a
<HI>number</HI> of weak, obscure, and even punning ones. What is now read by
the <HI>whole world,</HI> and the <HI>whole world's wife,</HI> is, Mr. Hervey's
Letter to Sir T. Hanmer. I own my <HI>taste</HI> is gratified in it, as well
as that <HI>unluckiness,</HI> natural to every one; though people say (I
think idly) he is mad. For this <HI>long</HI> letter I shall expect
<HI>two,</HI> soon after you have received it. Adieu!</P>
<P>DID you see a poem, called 
<Q REND="inline">"Woman in Miniature,"</Q> written with spirit, but

<SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I WRITE to you out of the abundant incli∣nation I have to hear from
you, imagining that, as you gave me a direction, you might pos∣sibly expect
to receive a previous letter from me. I want to be informed of the
impressions you receive from your <HI>new</HI> circumstances. The chief
aversion which some people have to orders is, what I fancy you will remove
in such as you converse with. I take it to be owing partly to dress, and
partly to the <HI>avowed profession</HI> of reli∣gion. A young clergyman,
that has distinguish∣ed his genius by a composition or two of a polite
nature, and is capable of dressing <HI>himself,</HI> and his
<HI>religion,</HI> in a different manner from the ge∣nerality of his
profession, that is, without for∣mality, is certainly a genteel character.
I speak this not with any sly design to advise, but to in∣timate, that
I think you very capable of <HI>shining</HI> <PB N="27" REF="38"/> in a
dark-coloured coat.—You must consider me yet as a man of the world,
and endeavouring to elicit that pleasure from gaiety, which my reason tells
me I shall never find.—It is impossible to express how stupid I
have been ever since I came home, insomuch that I cannot write a common
letter without six repetitions. This is the third time I have begun yours,
and you see what stuff it is made up of. I must e'en hasten to matter
of fact, which is the comfortable re∣source of dull people,—though,
even as to that, I have nothing to <HI>communicate.</HI> But I would be glad to
know, whether you are under a ne∣cessity of residing on week-days; and,
if not, why I may not expect you a day or two at the Leasows very
soon.—Did you make any enquiry concerning the number of my poems sold
at Ox∣ford? or did you hear any thing concerning it that concerns me to
hear?—Will S— (for that is his true name) is the excess of
simplicity and good-nature. He seems to have all the industry imaginable
to divert and amuse people, without any ambitious ends to serve, or
almost any con∣cern whether he has so much as a laugh allowed to his
stories, any farther than as a laugh is an indication that people are
delighted. This, joined with his turn of thought, renders him quite agreeable.
I wish it were in my power to conciliate acquaintance with half his
case.—Pray do not delay writing to me. Adieu!</P>

<HEAD>XV. To Mr. GRAVES, on similar Taste and Manners.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>The Leasows, 
<DATE>Sept. 13, 1741.</DATE></DATELINE> 
<SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I WAS very agreeably entertained by your last letter, as indeed I
am by every one of yours. It were affectation to except a paragraph or two on
account of partiality, where, to say the truth, the partiality itself
pleases one.—This I am very positive of, that to have a friend of
your temper and taste will always give me pleasure, whether I please the
world or no; but to please ever so much, without some such
friendship, would, in all probability, signify but little. I shall,
therefore, value any means that tend to confirm my opinion of your esteem for
me, pre∣ferably to any that shew me I am merely deserving of it. After all,
though a very limited number of <HI>friends</HI> may be sufficient, an idle
person should have a large <HI>acquaintance</HI>; and I believe I have the
least of any one that ever rambled about so much as I have done. I do not
know how it is, but I absolutely despair of ever being introduced into the
world. It may be objected by some (but you will not object it) that I may be
acquainted with a sufficient number of people that are my <HI>equals,</HI> if
I <HI>will.</HI> They may be my <HI>equals</HI> and <HI>supe∣riors,</HI> whom
they mean, for aught I care; but their conversation gives me no more
pleasure than the <HI>canking</HI> of a goose, or the quacking of a duck,
in affluent circumstances. Rather <HI>less</HI> indeed of the two,
because the idea of the sat goose flatters one's appetite; but the
<HI>human goose</HI> is neither fit to be heard nor eaten. I wish in∣deed
to be <HI>shewn into</HI> good company; but, if I can at all distinguish
the nature of my inclina∣tions, it is more in hopes of meeting with a re∣fined
conversation, than any thing else. I do not at all insist that my
genius is <HI>better</HI> than that <PB N="29" REF="40"/> of my vociferous
neighbours; if it be <HI>different,</HI> it is a sufficient reason why I
should seek such companions as suit it; and whether they are found in
high or low life, is little to the pur∣pose. But you will perhaps discern
the opera∣tions of <HI>vanity</HI> in all my endeavours; I will not disagree
with you, provided you will allow <HI>amusement</HI> an equal share in
them. It is the va∣nity to be intimate with men of distinguished sense,
not of distinguished fortune. And this is a vanity which you should not
disapprove, be∣cause it will bind me a lasting friend to you and your
family.</P>
<P>I have been over at Shiffnall, and, in order to make myself
agreeable, rode a hunting with Mr. Pitt. I confess I was somewhat diverted;
and my horse was so much an enthusiast, as to be very near running
headlong into a deep wa∣ter. I believe, if I were to turn sportsman, I
should soon break my neck, for fear the hunts∣man should despise
me.</P>
<P>I will certainly endeavour to see you at Bir∣mingham; but beg you
would write me a long letter in the mean time; and contrive, if you can, to
make it look like a packet, as your last did, for the sight thereof is
exceedingly com∣fortable.</P>
<P>Though my wishes will not suffer me to believe that your eyes
are in the danger you represent; yet, supposing them to be only very
weak, I would recommend some musical instrument, that is most agreeable
to you. I have often looked upon music as my dernier resort, if I should
ever dis∣card the world, and turn eremite entirely. Con∣sider what other
amusement can make an equal impression in old age.</P>
<P>I have filled my paper not without difficulty, through the
barrenness of my brain, and situa∣tion: my heart ever slows with the
most warm streams of gratitude and affection for you. Adieu!</P>

<P>YOU must give me leave to complain of your last letter, three
parts of which is filled with mere apology: I thought we had some time
agreed, for our mutual emolument, to lay aside ceremonies of this species;
till I was made Poet-laureat, and you Bishop of Winches∣ter.—Why
Bishop of Winchester, for God's sake? Why—because—he is
prelate of the Garter—an order, in all kinds of ceremony so greatly
abounding.—Here am I still, trifling away my time, my money, and, I
think, my health, which I fancy greatly inferior to what it it would be in the
country. Truth is, I do make shift to vary my days a little here; and, 
<PB N="32" REF="43"/> calling to mind the many irksome hours, the stupid
identity of which I have been so often sick in the country, I conclude that
I am less <HI>un∣happy</HI> than I shall find myself at
home.—Howe∣ver, next month I hope to see the Leasows with an
appetite.—Walks in the park are now de∣lightfully pleasant: the company
stays in the Mall till ten every night.—Mrs. Olive, Mrs. Wof∣fington,
Barbarini, and Mr. Garrick (happy man!) are gone over to Ireland, to act there
for two months.—Mr. Outing, the last time I saw him, told me how Dr.
Mackenzie cured him of ever fighting with scrubs, 
<Q REND="inline">"I was just going, says he, to kick a fellow
down stairs, when the Doctor cries out, 'Mr. Outing! hear our Scotch pro∣verb

whether he get or lose the victory, is sure to be b—t.' I had great
difficulty (continued he) to contain my∣self till he had finished his

wish <HI>I</HI> could <HI>cure</HI> him as easily of these Quixo∣tical

observing, that no creatures, though ever so loathsome, (as toads,
serpents, adders, &amp;c.) would be half so hated as ourselves, if we
were to give vent to our spleen, and censure affections so bluntly as
some people do. I would not venture this hint, if I did not believe you
experience the same. For my part, people contradict me in things I have
<HI>studied,</HI> and am <HI>certain</HI> of; and I keep silence even from
<HI>good words</HI> (<HI>bons mots</HI>) though it is pain and grief to me. I

are <HI>jus∣tifiable</HI> motives to wish for some degree of same; that

<SALUTE>My good friend,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>OUR old friend Somervile is dead! I did not imagine I could have
been so sorry as I find myself on this occasion. 
<Q REND="inline">"Sublatum quaerimus."</Q> I can now excuse all his
foibles; impute them to age, and to distress of circum∣stances; the
last of these considerations wrings my very soul to think on. For a man
of high spirit, conscious of having (at least in one pro∣duction)
generally pleased the world, to be plagued and threatened by wretches that
are low in every sense; to be forced to drink him∣self into pains of the
body in order to get rid of the pains of the mind, is a misery which I can
well conceive, because I may, without va∣nity, esteem myself his equal in
point of oeco∣nomy, and consequently <HI>ought</HI> to have an eye on his
misfortunes: (As you kindly hinted to me at twelve o'clock at the Feathers) I
should retrench;—I will; but you shall not see me:—I will not
let you know that I took your hint in good part. I will do it at solitary
times, as I may: and yet there will be some difficulty in it; for whatever
the <HI>world</HI> might esteem in poor Somervile, I really find, upon
critical en∣quiry, that <HI>I</HI> loved him for nothing so much as his
flocci-nauci-nihili-pili fication of money.</P>
<P>Mr. A— was honourably acquitted: Lord A—, who was
present, and behaved very in∣solently <PB N="39" REF="52"/> they say, was
hissed out of court. They proved his application to the carpenter's son,
to get him to swear against Mr. A—, though the boy was proved to have
said in several compa∣nies (<HI>before</HI> he had been kept at Lord
A—'s house) that he was sure the thing was acciden∣tal. Finally, it
is believed he will recover the title of A—ea.</P>
<P>The apprehension of the whores, and the suffocation of four in
the round-house, by the <HI>stupidity</HI> of the keeper, engrosses the
talk of the town. The said house is rebuilding every day (for the mob on
Sunday night demolished it), and re-demolished every night. The Duke of M
—gh, J— S— his brother, Lord C— G—, were taken
into the round-house, and confined from eleven at night till eleven next day:
I am not positive of the Duke of M—gh, the others are certain: and that
a large number of people of the first fashion went from the round-house
to De Veil's, to give in informations of their usage. The justice himself
seems greatly scared; the prosecution will be carried on with violence,
so as probably to hang the keeper, and there is an end.</P>
<P>Lord Bath's coachman got drunk and tumbled from his box, and he was
forced to borrow Lord Orford's. Wits say, that it was but gra∣titude for my
Lord Orford's <HI>coachman</HI> to drive my Lord Bath, as my Lord Bath
<HI>himself</HI> had driven my Lord Orford. Thus they.</P>

<HEAD>XXII. To Mr. Graves, on Benevolence and Friendship.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>The Leasows, 
<DATE>Jan, 19, 1741-2.</DATE></DATELINE> 
<SALUTE>Dear Mr. Graves,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I CANNOT forbear immediately writing to you: the pleasure your
last letter gave me puts it out of my power to restrain the over∣flowings
of my benevolence. I can easily con∣ceive that, upon some extraordinary
instances of friendship, my heart might be <HI>si sort attendri,</HI>
that I could not bear any restraint upon my ability to shew my gratitude.
It is an observa∣tion I made upon reading to day's paper, which contains an
account of C. Khevenhuller's suc∣cess in favour of the Queen of Hungary. To
think what sublime affection must influence that poor unfortunate Queen,
should a faithful and zealous General revenge her upon her enemies, and
restore her ruined affairs!</P>
<P>Had a person shewn an esteem and affection for <HI>me,</HI>
joined with any elegance, or without any elegance, in the expression of it,
I should have been in acute pain till I had given some sign of my
willingness to serve him.—From <HI>all</HI> this, I conclude that I
have more humanity than some others.</P>
<P>Probably enough I shall never meet with a larger share of
happiness than I feel at present. If not, I am thoroughly convinced, my
pain is greatly superior to my pleasure. That pleasure is not
absolutely dependent on the mind, I know from this, that I have enjoyed
happier scenes in the company of some friends, than I can possibly at
present;—but alas; all the time you and I shall enjoy together,
abstracted from the rest of our lives, and lumped, will not perhaps amount
to a solid year and a half. How small a proportion!</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="54"/>People will say to one that talks thus, 
<Q REND="inline">"Would you die?"</Q> To set the case upon a
right footing, they must take away the hopes of greater happiness in
<HI>this</HI> life, the feares of great∣er misery hereafter, together with
the bodily <HI>pain</HI> of dying, and address me in a disposition
betwixt mirth and melancholy; and I could easily resolve them.</P>
<P>I do not know how I am launched out so far into this complaint: it
is, perhaps, a strain of constitutional whining; the effect of the
wind—did it come from the winds? to the winds will I deliver it: 
<Q> 
<L>Tradam protervis in mare Creticum,</L> 
<L>Portare ventis—</L></Q></P>
<P>I will be as happy as my fortune will permit, and make others so: 
<Q> 
<L>Pone me pigris ubi <HI>nulla campis</HI></L> 
<L><HI>Arbor</HI> aestiva recreatur aura.</L></Q></P>
<P>I will be so. The joke is, that the descrip∣tion which you gave
of that country was, that you had few trees about you; so that I should
<HI>trick</HI> fortune if she should grant my petition im∣plicitly. But in
earnest, I intend to come and stay a day or two with you next summer.</P>
<P>Mr. Whistler is at Mr. Gosling's, bookseller, at the Mitre and
Crown, in Fleet-street, and en∣quired much after you in his last letter to
me. He writes to me; but I believe his affection for one weighs less with
him, while the town is in the other scale. Though he is very obliging. I do
not know whether I do right, when I say I believe we three, that is, in
solitary circum∣stances, have an equal idea of, and affection for, each
other. I say, supposing each to be alone, or in the country, which is
nearly the same; for scenes alter minds as much as the air influ∣ences
bodies. For instance, when Mr. Whistler <PB N="42" REF="55"/> is in town, I
suppose we love him better than he does us; and when we are in town, I
sup∣pose the same may be said in regard to him.</P>
<P>The true burlesque of Spenser (whose cha∣racteristic is
simplicity) seems to consist in a <HI>simple</HI> representation of
such things as one laughs to <HI>see</HI> or to <HI>observe</HI> one's
self, rather than in any <HI>monstrous</HI> contrast between the thoughts
and words. I cannot help thinking that my added stanzas have more of his
manner than what you saw before, which you are not a judge of, till you have
read him.</P>

<SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THOUGH your last letter seemed to put my correspondence upon
an ostentatious footing, namely, an inclination to be witty, yet I assure
you it was not any punctilious conside∣ration of that kind that has kept me
so long silent. Indeed with some people one would stand upon the
nicest punctilios; for though ceremony be altogether lighter than vanity
itself, yet it surely weighs as much as the acquaintance of the
un∣deserving. But this is trifling, because it can have no reference to a
person for whom I have the greatest affection.</P>
<P>In regard to my Oxford affairs, you did all I could expect. I have
wrote since to Mr. M—, who, either for your sake or mine, will, I
dare say, settle them to my satisfaction.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="56"/>I wish your journey and head-ach would have
permitted you to have been a little more parti∣cular concerning the seat of
the Muses; but I suppose nothing material distinguished your
fortnight.</P>
<P>Mr. Whistler has relapsed at Whitchurch; but purposed, when I
last heard from him, to go to London before this time. I do not en∣tirely
understand his schemes, but should have been sincerely glad of his
company with me this winter; and, he says, he is not fond of
London.—For my part, I designed to go thither the next month, but the
fever (which is chiefly violent in towns) discourages me.</P>
<P>Some time ago, I read Spenser's Fairy Queen; and, when I had
finished, thought it a proper time to make some additions and corrections
in my trifling imitation of him, the School-mistress. His subject is
certainly bad, and his action in∣expressibly confused; but there are
some parti∣culars in him that charm one. Those which afford the greatest
scope for a ludicrous imita∣tion are, his simplicity and obsolete
phrase; and yet these are what give one a very singular plea∣sure in
the perusal. The burlesque which they occasion is of quite a different
kind to that of Philips's Shilling, Cotton's Travestie, Hudibras, or Swift's
works; but I need not tell <HI>you</HI> this. I inclose a copy, for your
amusement and opi∣nion; which, if franks are plentiful, you may return, and
save me the <HI>tedious</HI> trouble of writ∣ing it over again. The other
paper was, <HI>bona fide,</HI> written to divert my thoughts from pain, for the
same reason that I smoaked; actions equally reputable.</P>
<P>Mr. Somervile's poem upon hawking, called, 
<Q REND="inline">"Field Sports,"</Q> I suppose, is out by this
time. It was sent to Mr. Lyttleton, to be read to the Prince, to whom it was
inscribed. It seems he is fond of hawking.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="57"/>I have often thought those to be the most
enviable people whom one least envies—I be∣lieve, married men are the
happiest that are; but I cannot say I envy them, because they lose all
their merit in the eyes of other ladies.</P>
<P>I beg sincerely that you would write in a week's time at
furthest, that I may receive your letter <HI>here,</HI> if I should go from
home this win∣ter. I will never use any thing by way of con∣clusion, but

<SALUTE>Dear Mr. Graves!</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM glad the stay you make in Hereford∣shire amuses you, even
though it puts you upon preferring the place you reside at to my own place of
residence. I do not know whe∣ther it be from the prejudice of being born at
the Leasows, or from any real beauty in the situa∣tion; but I would wish
no other, would some one, by an addition of two hundred pounds a year, put it
in my power to exhibit my own designs. It is what I can now do in no other
method than on paper. I live in such an un∣oeconomical manner, that I must
not indulge myself in the plantation of a tree for the fu∣ture. I have
glutted myself with the extremity of solitude, and must adapt my expences
more to sociable life. It is on this account that it seems more prudent for
me to buy a chair while <PB N="45" REF="58"/> I am in town, than to carry down
twelve gui∣neas for the model of the tomb of Virgil, an urn, and a scheme or
two more of like nature.—I long to have my picture, <HI>distantly</HI>
approach∣ing to a profile (the best manner I can think of to express
myself), drawn by Davison. I have seen your sister's, and think the
<HI>face</HI> well done in every respect;—but am greatly indignant with
other things of a less fixed nature The cap, though a good cap enough, has a
vile effect; the formality of stays, &amp;c. not agreeable.—I do not
know if you saw the picture of a Scotch girl there at full length! Miss
Graves has the advantage of her's, or any picture there, in her person; but
certainly this girl's hair is inexpres∣sibly charming! There is the
genteelest negli∣gence in it I ever saw in any picture:—what follows,
but that I wish your sister would give orders to pull off her cap, and
have hair after the manner of this picture?—To speak abruptly; as it
<HI>is,</HI> I disapprove it: were it altered, I should like it beyond any
I ever saw.—I am glad you are reading Spenser: though his plan is
detes∣table, and his <HI>invention</HI> less wonderful than most people
imagine, who do not much consider the obviousness of allegory; yet, I
think, a person of your disposition must take great delight in his
<HI>simplicity,</HI> his good-nature, &amp;c. Did you observe a stanza
that begins a canto somewhere, 
<Q> 
<L>Nought is there under heav'n's wide hollowness</L> 
<L>That breeds, &amp;c.</L></Q></P>
<P>When I bought him first, I read a page or two of the Fairy Queen,
and cared not to pro∣ceed. After that, Pope's Alley made me con∣sider him
ludicrously; and in that light, I think, one may read him with pleasure. I
am now (as Ch—mley with —), from trifling and laughing at him,
really in love with him. I think even <PB N="46" REF="59"/> the metre pretty
(though I shall never use it in earnest); and that the last Alexandrine
has an extreme majesty.—Does not this line strike you (I do not
justly remember what canto it is in);

<P>I DEPENDED a good deal on an immediate answer from you, and am

arrived several days before you left it. I beseech you to send me a line

<P>I cannot help considering myself as a sports∣man (though God

<HI>fly up</HI> for a little time; and then <HI>settle</HI> again. My cue is,
to discharge my <HI>piece</HI> when I observe a number together. This week,
they are straggling round about their pasture, the town: the next, they

amongst them.—I assure you, I shall be very easy about the
acquisition of any same by this <PB N="47" REF="60"/> thing; all I much
wish is, to lose none; and indeed I have so little to lose, that this
conside∣ration scarcely affects me.</P>
<P>I dare say it must be very incorrect; for I have added eight or
ten stanzas within this fortnight. But inaccuracy is more excusable in
ludicrous poetry than in any other. If it strikes <HI>any,</HI> it must be
merely people of <HI>taste</HI>; for peo∣ple of <HI>wit</HI> without taste

Philips's misfortune, of mere <HI>childishness,</HI> 
<Q REND="inline">"little charm of placid mien, &amp;c."</Q> I have
added a ludicrous index, purely to shew (fools) that I am in
jest;—and my motto 
<Q REND="inline">"O quà sol habitabiles illustrat oras,

conceive how large the number is of those that mistake burlesque for the
very foolish∣ness it exposes (which observation I made once at the
Rehearsal, at Tom Thumb, at Chronon∣hotonthologos; all which are pieces of
elegant humour.) I have some mind to pursue this caution further; and

if a per∣son seriously calls this, or rather, burlesque, a childish
or low species of poetry, he says wrong. For the most regular and formal
poetry may be called trifling, folly, and weakness, in compa∣rison of what
is written with a more <HI>manly</HI> spirit in ridicule of it.—I have

phae∣nomena, that have amused you in your travels; and will <HI>equally</HI>
affect me, as they relate to you. Above all things, be particular in regard to
your calculations respecting Mickleton. I would have certainly met you there,
as you desired me: there is no company I am fonder of than yours, and your
sisters; and no place at which I have spent more agreeable hours than
Mickleton. But your brother has lost one of his recom∣mendations in my eye;
that is, his <HI>irregularity</HI> of house-keeping. He has several left,
which are sufficient to preserve my utmost esteem; but that was a jewel
indeed! I love to go where there is nothing much more in form than my∣self. I
have no objection to visit <HI>young, unsettled people,</HI> with a
mountebank's inconsistency in my equipage. But where a considerable
family keeps up its forms (as marriage requires) I should not care to appear
with an hired horse, and a <HI>Sancho</HI> for my valet. The case is, I
<HI>could</HI> live in a way genteel enough, and uniformly so; but then, I
must forego megrims, whims, toys, and so forth. Now, though it gives me
pain, <HI>sometimes,</HI> not to appear of a piece; yet that
<HI>infrequent</HI> pain is not a balance for the substan∣tial happiness
which I find in an urn, a seal, a snuff-box, an engraving, or a bust.
Ambition, too, as it puts me upon wishing to make a figure, makes me very
indifferent as to making a com∣mon, every-day-gentlemanly figure; and saves
me from appearing solicitous about the 
<Q REND="inline">"res <PB N="49" REF="62"/> <HI>mediocriter</HI>

vanity to you in ca∣taracts; but I hope you will rather consider it as a mark
of my <HI>confidence,</HI> and, consequently, my sincere esteem and
affection: for, I take it, the former seldom subsists without the
latter. And as to what I said about my love of flattery, I hope, you will not
construe it as any <HI>hint</HI>; nei∣ther, if I am right, would you be so
ungenerous as not to comply with me. I sincerely think, that flattery
amongst foes is absolutely desirable; amongst one's <HI>common
acquaintance,</HI> a behaviour <HI>rather inclining</HI> to it: but amongst
<HI>friends,</HI> its consequences are of too dangerous a nature.</P>
<P>I am so unhappy in my wintery, unvisited state, that I can
almost say with Dido, 
<Q REND="inline">"taedet coeli convexa tueri."</Q> I am miserable,
to think that I have not thought enough to amuse me. I walk a day together;
and have no idea, but what comes in at my eyes. I long for some sub∣ject
about the size of Philips's Cyder, to settle heartily about; something
that I could enrich by episodes drawn from the English history:
<HI>Stone∣henge</HI> has some of the advantages I like; but seems a dead,
lifeless title. If you chance to think of a subject which you do not

elicited from me as sincere a laugh as I can ever recollect. Nothing, sure,
can be com∣parable to his representation of Parolles in his bully-character;

<SALUTE>Dear Mr. Graves,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU say it is no way unpleasing to you to receive my letters; if
you say the thing that is not, the fault, like others, produces its own
punishment.—You are now my only cor∣respondent. I do not know what
reason Whistler has for not caring to write, unless he thinks that we
ought not to trouble ourselves about one another, but bend our whole
endeavours to mend our fortunes; though I do not <HI>know</HI> his
imaginations. I was afraid, after what I had said concerning
<HI>sameness</HI> in my last, that you would interpret it to your own
disadvantage; but was too lazy to write my letter again, trust∣ing that I
could deny the extent of my com∣plaint to any one besides myself in some
future letter. There is as much variety in your genius, as fortune can
introduce into your circumstances.</P>
<P>Some time next week, do I purpose to set out for London. The
reasons for my going at all do <HI>barely</HI> preponderate. I cannot,
<HI>conscienti∣ously,</HI> print any thing. I have two or three little
matters in hand: none that I am greatly fond of, much less that are at all
mature. One is, what you have seen, though in its mortal state, 
<Q REND="inline">"Flattery, or the fatal Exotic;"—</Q>so very
quotidian and copious a subject, that I dislike it entirely. Another, 
<Q REND="inline">"Elegies in Hammond's Metre,"</Q> but upon
<HI>real</HI> and natural subjects: this I have objections to. A third, 
<Q REND="inline">"An Essay on Reserve;"</Q> the subject
genteel, I think, but scarce ten lines finished. A fourth, 
<Q REND="inline">"An Essay, in blank Verse, on Oeconomy, with
Advice to Poets on that Head, concluding with a ludi∣crous Description of a
Poet's Apartment."</Q> I <PB N="53" REF="66"/> think it were better to
<HI>annex</HI> that poem thus, to prevent its clashing, like an earthen pot,
against Philips's silver vase, though his humour lies chiefly in the
language. My favourite scheme is a poem, in blank verse, upon Rural
<HI>Elegance,</HI> including cascades, temples, grottos, hermitages,
green-houses, which introduces my favorite epi∣sode of the Spanish lady
(you will wonder <HI>how,</HI> but I think <HI>well</HI>) to close the
first book. The next, running upon planting, &amp;c. will end with a vista
terminated by an old abbey, which intro∣duces an episode concerning the
effects of Ro∣mish power, interdicts, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in imitation of
Lu∣cretius's 
<Q REND="inline">"Plague of Athens,"</Q> t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ken from Thu∣cydides, Virgil's Murrain, and Ovid's
Pestilence, &amp;c. The two episodes in great forwardness;—but,
alas! I do not like formal didactic poetry, and shall never be able to
finish aught <HI>but</HI> the episodes, I doubt: unless I allow myself
to treat the rest in <HI>my own</HI> manner, transiently—as Camilla
skimmed over the wheat-stubble.</P>
<P>I have altered this ballad, you see; I doubt, not to your mind:
but send your criticisms, and I will be all obedience, From London I will
send you mine on your more important poem; your critique will be important
upon my silly affair; mine silly, I am afraid, upon your mo∣mentous
one—but you do not think it momen∣tous, as you ought. Direct to Nando's.
I am</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Your most sincere and affectionate friend and
humble servant, W. S.</SIGNED> <POSTSCRIPT>
<P>I question whether I should be more unhappy in any mere

deal as much in <HI>repetition</HI> as any trade) than I am in great part of 
<PB N="54" REF="67"/> my time when my head is unfit for study.—My
neighbour is gone to London, and has left me a legacy of franks, so I shall
be able to return your poem, &amp;c. at least by parcels. I strenuously
purpose to be there (or to set out) next week; but, as I <HI>am</HI> here
at present, I think you ought to pay some deference to the <HI>vis

<SALUTE>Dear Mr. Graves,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>DR. Swift would not have scrupled to print your parody, with his
name to it. Why should you, <HI>without</HI> your name? I had a violent
inclination to print it in a large folio, four leaves, price four-pence: but I
dare not do it, for fear you should think it of evil importance with regard
to the clergy. You excel me infi∣nitely in a way in which I take most
pleasure; odd picturesque description. Send me word whether I shall
print it or no—and that right soon.—I have lingered in town till
now, and did not receive your letter till this morning.—I do not know
whether I shall send you with this letter a little thing which I wrote in
an after∣noon, and, with proper <HI>demands</HI> of being con∣cealed as the
author, sold for two guineas.—Next time I am in town, I will get money
like a haberdasher. I will amuse myself with find∣ing out the people's
weak side, and so furnish them with <HI>suitable
nonsense.</HI>—I would have you <PB N="55" REF="68"/> do the
same.—Make your wit bear your charges. Indeed, as to the little parody
you send, it would fix your reputation with men of sense as much as
(greatly more than) the whole tedious character of Parson Adams. I read it
half a year ago; the week after I came to town; but made Mr. Shuckburgh take it
again, imagining it alto∣gether a very mean performance.—I liked a tenth
part pretty well; but, as Dryden says of Horace (unjustly) he shews his
teeth without laughing: the greater part is <HI>unnatural</HI> and
<HI>unhumourous.</HI> It has some advocates; but, I observe, those not
such as I ever esteemed tasters. Finally, what makes <HI>you
endeavour</HI> to like it?</P>
<P>My printer was preparing his bill for the School-mistress, when
I stopped him short, with a hint to go to Dodsley, who has not yet
reckon∣ed with me for Hercules. Let <HI>the dead</HI> bury their <HI>dead.</HI>
Dr. Young's Complaint is the best thing that has come out this season
(these <HI>twenty years,</HI> Pope says) except mine, for so
<HI>thinks</HI> every author, who does think proper to say so: poor Pope's
history, in Cibber's Letter, and the print of him upon the Mount of Love (the
<HI>coarsest</HI> is most <HI>humorous</HI>) must surely mortify him.
Your sister does me great honour to think my hint any thing; but I am quite
zealous in my appro∣bation of that Scotch lady's hair. I will <HI>ever</HI> aim
at <HI>oddness,</HI> for the future; it is cheaper to follow taste than
fashion, and whoever he be that devotes himself to <HI>taste</HI> will be
<HI>odd</HI> of course.—You send me the verses on Lord Hay: they
were hacked about town three months ago, and I saw them. The town is
certainly the scene for a man of curiosity.—I do not purpose to be
long away; but I must think of retrenching—I have ten thousand things
to tell you, but I have not room. Such people as <HI>we</HI> should meet as
regularly to compare notes as tradesmen do to settle accounts, but oftener;
there is no good <PB N="56" REF="69"/> comes of long reckonings;—I shall
forget half;—I think it should be four days in a fortnight—it
would not do;—it would make one <HI>mindful</HI> of, and consequently
more uneasy on account of, absence. Every one gets posts, preferments,
but myself.—Nothing but my ambition can set me on a footing with
them, and make me easy. Come then, lordly pride! &amp;c. The devil thought
with me in Milton,

<P>I SHALL send you but a very few lines, being so much

so;—for of late I have not so violent a taste for toys as I have
had; and I can look even on snuff-boxes 
<Q REND="inline">"oculo irretorto."</Q></P>
<P>London is really dangerous at this time; the pick-pockets, formerly
content with mere <HI>filching,</HI> make no scruple to knock people down
with bludgeons in <HI>Fleet-street</HI> and the <HI>Strand,</HI> and that at
no later hour than eight o'clock at night; but in the Piazza's, Covent-garden,
they come <PB N="57" REF="70"/> in large bodies, armed with couteaus, and attack
whole parties, so that the danger of coming out of the play-houses is of
some weight in the opposite scale, when I am disposed to go to them
oftener than I ought.—There is a poem of this season, called 
<Q REND="inline">"The Pleasures of Imagination,"</Q> worth your
reading; but it is an expensive quarto; if it comes out in a less size, I
will bring it home with me, Mr. Pope (as Mr. Out∣ing, who has been with Lord
Bolingbroke, in∣forms me) is at the point of death.—My Lord Carteret
said yesterday in the house, 
<Q REND="inline">"That the French and Spaniards had actually
<HI>said,</HI> they would attempt a second invasion."—</Q>There is
a new play acted at Drury Lane, 
<Q REND="inline">"Mahomet,"</Q> translated from the French of
Voltaire; but I have no great opinion of the subject, or the original author
as a poet; and my diffidence is rather improved by the testimony of those
who have seen it.—I lodge between the two coffee-houses, George's and
Nando's, so that I partake of the expensiveness of both, as heretofore. I
have no acquaintance in town, and but slender inducement to stay; and yet,
probably, I shall loiter here for a month.</P>

knighted—the devil of a knight, e'faith!"—</Q>I believe he was
sincere in his disgust; for there had been two barge-masters knighted
in his neighbourhood some time before.</P>
<P>I saw, coming up, Lady Fane's grotto, which, they say, cost
her five thousand pounds; about three times as much as her <HI>house</HI>

<SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I LONG heartily to talk over affairs with you <HI>téte

transcribing what might pass well enough in conversation.—I shall
say nothing more concerning my departure from L—, than that it was
necessary, and therefore excusable.—I have been since with a
gentleman upon the borders of Wales, Bishop's Castle, from whence I made a
digression one day beyond Offa's Dyke: saw mountains which converted all
that I <HI>had</HI> seen into mole-hills; and houses which changed the
Leasows into Hampton Court: where they talk of a glazed window as a piece of
magnifi∣cence; and where their highest idea of his Majesty is, that he can
ride in such a coach as 'Squire Jones or Squire Pryce's. The woman of the

<P>You agree with the rest of the married world in a propensity to

in some people gives one a kind of dread of the matter. They are ill-natured,

<SALUTE>Dear Mr. Graves!</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>TO-MORROW morning I set out for Cheltenham, to make trial of the
waters there. I shall, perhaps, add to this letter at several stages, and
conclude it at the place to which I am going; so that, like those
springs, you may, perhaps, find it impregnated with the nature of all those
places thro' which it passes; perhaps quite the contrary.</P>
<P>—, if I mistake not the man, is an encou∣rager of works of
taste, &amp;c. though I am going to instance this oddly: he was a hearty
stickler for my poem upon Hercules at Bath, as D. Jago sent me word.
Perhaps it was complaisance to Mr. Lyttleton, with whom, Charles, &amp;c. he
is intimate, if, as I said before, I do not mistake the person. I flatter
myself, I do not; and I hope that we two shall ever find the same
per∣sons, or the same kind of persons, our friends, and also our
enemies.</P>
<P>If I get over this ill habit of body, depend upon it, I
<HI>will</HI> have a <HI>reverend</HI> care of my health, as Sir John
Falstaff advises the Chief Justice. <PB N="61" REF="74"/> I solve all
the tempests that disturb my constitu∣tion into <HI>wind:</HI> it plagues
me, first, in the shape of a bad appetite, then indigestion, then
low∣ness of spirits and a flux of pale water, and at night by watchings,
restlessness, twitchings of my nerves, or a sleep more distracted
than the most active state of watchfulness. But I think purging
lessens all these symptoms, and I trust my scheme that I am
entering upon is right.</P>
<P>I was, on Monday, at Hagley, to wait on Mr. Lyttleton, who was gone
to Sir John Ast∣ley's, to see his grand edifice.—As to Mrs.
Lyt∣tleton, if her affability is not artificial, I mean if it does not owe its
original (as it <HI>ought to do</HI> its <HI>management</HI>) to art, I cannot
conceive a per∣son more amiable;—but <HI>sense</HI> and
<HI>elegance</HI> cannot be seigned: to <HI>exhibit</HI> them, is to
<HI>have</HI> them.</P>
<P>How is my song set? Miss Carrington pro∣cured it that favour;
but I have never seen a copy, nor knew of its being to be printed. Howard has
set another of mine, which I re∣ceived last post; but my harpsichord is
out of order, and I have found no one yet to explain the hieroglyphicks which
convey it. You may probably find it in some future number of the British
Orpheus. 
<Q REND="inline">"By the side of a stream, &amp;c."</Q></P>
<P>I am in as good spirits this instant as ever I was in my life:
only 
<Q REND="inline">"Mens turbidum laetatur."</Q> My head is a little
confused; but I often think seriously, that I ought to have the most
ardent and <HI>practical</HI> gratitude (as the Methodists chuse to
express themselves) for the advantages that I have: which, though not
eminently shining, are such, to speak the truth, as suit my particu∣lar
humour, and, consequently, deserve all kind of acknowledgment. If a poet
should address himself to God Almighty, with the most earnest thanks
for his goodness in allotting him an estate that was over-run with
shrubs, thickets, and coppices, variegated with barren rocks and 
<PB N="62" REF="75"/> precipices, or floated three parts in four with lakes and
marches, rather than such an equal and fertile spot as the 
<Q REND="inline">"sons of men"</Q> delight in; to my
apprehension, he would be guilty of no absurdity.—But of this I have
composed a kind of prayer, and intend to write a little spe∣culation on the
subject; this kind of gratitude I assuredly ought to have, and have. For
my health, if one reflects, a country-fellow's stock of it would be unfit for
solitude; would dispose one rather to bodily feats, and, what Falstaff
calls in Poins, <HI>gambol</HI> faculties, than mental contemplations, and
would give one that kind of pain which springs from <HI>impatience.</HI> My
con∣stitution was given me originally good; and with regard to it now (as G.
Barnwell says) 
<Q REND="inline">"What am I?—What I <HI>have made
myself.</HI>"</Q> Or, to speak with Milton, 
<Q> 
<L>Him after all disputes</L> 
<L>Forc'd I absolve: all my evasions vain,</L> 
<L>And reasonings, tho' thro' mazes, only lead</L> 
<L>But to my own conviction. First and last</L> 
<L>On me, me only, as the source and spring</L> 
<L>Of all corruption, all the blame lights due.</L></Q> Though this
is but vulgarly expressed in Milton neither.</P>
<P>Jago has been here this last week, and I drove him to Dudley
Castle, which I long to shew you: I never saw it (since I was the
size of my pen) before: it has great romantic beauty, though perhaps
Derbyshire may render it of small note in your eye.</P>
<P>One is tempted to address the K— as Harry the Eighth does
his wife, <HI>mutatis mutandis;</HI> 
<Q> 
<L>Go thy ways, George!</L> 
<L>Whoe'er he be that shall assert he has</L> 
<L>A <HI>bolder</HI> king, let him in nought be trusted</L> 
<L>For saying false in that—</L></Q></P>
<P>I have a mind to write an ode in praise of him, and in rivalship
of Cibber.—Mine should <PB N="63" REF="76"/> be of the ballad style
and familiarity, as expres∣sing the sentiments of a person returning
from a dislike to a thorough approbation of him, which seems, at present
the sense of the nation.—But herein I am not in earnest.—</P>
<P>My pen has run on a whole page at random. It amuses me to
encourage it, and so I will try to get a frank.</P>
<P>I am this moment arrived at Cheltenham, af∣ter an expensive and
fatiguing journey. I called yesterday at Micklington; saw the portico, and
snapped up a bit of mutton at your brother's; drank a dish of tea with
Miss S—; and, in op∣position to the strongest remonstrances,
persisted in an endeavour to reach Cheltenham after five o'clock. The
consequence was, that, about ten, I found myself travelling back again
to∣wards Stowe; and had undoubtedly wandered all night in the dark, had I not
been fortu∣nately met by a waggoner's servant, who brought me back to the
worst inn but one I ever lay at, being his master's.—Here I am: which

<SALUTE>Dear Mr. Jago,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is not a contrived apology, or an excuse, which I am going to
offer for the disap∣pointments I have given you. I have actually been so
much out of order ever since I wrote to you, nay, ever since I <HI>formed a
design</HI> of a Sun∣day expedition to L—, that it never has been in my
<HI>power</HI> to execute my intentions. My ver∣tigo has not yet taken away my
senses; God knows how soon it may do; but my nerves are 
<PB N="64" REF="77"/> in such a condition, that I can scarce get a wink of
even <HI>disordered</HI> rest for whole nights together. May you never know
the misery of such invo∣luntary vigils! I ride every day almost to
fa∣tigue; which only tends to make my want of sleep more
<HI>sensible,</HI> and not in the least to re∣move it. I have
<HI>spirits</HI> all day, good ones; though my head is dizzy, and I never
enterprize any study of greater subtlety than a news-paper. I cannot say
the journey to L— would be at all <HI>formidable</HI> to me; for I ride
about fifteen miles, as I compute it, every day before dinner. But the nights,
from home, would be insuppor∣table to me. I have fatigued Mrs. Arnold's
assiduity, to the injury of her health; by occa∣sioning her to sit in
my room a'nights, light my candle, put it out again, make me perspiratory
wheys, and slops; and am amused by the most silly animadversions
she is capable of making. I never knew her usefulness till now; but I
<HI>now</HI> prefer her to <HI>all</HI> of <HI>her station.</HI> If I get
over this disorder, concerning which I have bad ap∣prehensions, you may
depend upon seeing me the first Sunday I dare venture forth. I hope
<HI>you</HI> continue mending. The benefit of <HI>riding</HI> is only not
universal, and would cure <HI>me</HI> too, could I but make one previous
advance towards health. Have you tried cold bathing? Perhaps it may not suit
your case. I wish I had not dropt it. I take my fluctuation of nerves to be
caused, as that of the sea is, by wind; which I am continually pumping up,
and yet find it still renewed. When I am just sinking to sleep, a
sudden twitch of my nerves calls me back again—to watchfulness, and
vexation! I consider myself as in the state of the philosopher, who
held a bullet betwixt his finger and thumb, which, whenever he was about to
nod, was ordered so as to fall into a large brass pan, and 
<PB N="65" REF="78"/> wake him—that he might pursue his
lucubra∣tions.</P>
<P>I will mention one circumstance regarding the weakness of my
nerves;—and not my spi∣rits, for I told you those were
tolerable:—the least noise that is, even the falling of a
fire-shovel upon the floor, if it happen unexpected∣ly, shocks my whole
frame; and I actually be∣lieve that a gun fired, behind my back, unawares,
amidst the stillness of the night, would go near to kill me with its
noise.</P>
<P>I am just going to bed; and dare not be any more attentive, as I
hope to close my eyes for a minute. So fare you well!</P>
<P>It is now six o'clock in the morning, and I have had about five
hours middling sleep; which encourages me greatly: so I will <HI>hope</HI>
to be able to see you next Sunday sevennight.</P>
<P>What think you of the battle? Are not you so much in love with our
King, that you could find in your heart to serve him in any profita∣ble
post he might assign you?</P>
<P>Capt. L— is wounded in the thigh.</P>
<P>When I ride in my chair round my neigh∣bourhood, I am as much
stared and wondered at, as a giant would be that should walk through
Pall-mall. My vehicle is at <HI>least as</HI> uncommon hereabouts as a
blazing comet. My chief plea∣sure lies in finding out a thousand roads, and
delightful little haunts near home, which I ne∣ver dreamt of: egregious

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>July 3, 1743.</DATE></DATELINE> 
<SALUTE>Dear Mr. Graves!</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I DID not part from you without a <HI>great deal</HI> of melancholy.
To think of the <HI>short</HI> duration of those interviews which are the
ob∣jects of one's <HI>continual</HI> wishes, has been a reflec∣tion that has
plagued me of old! I am sure I returned home with it then, more aggravated as
I foresaw myself returning to the same series of melancholy hours from
which you had a while relieved me, and which I had <HI>particularly</HI>
suf∣fered under all this last spring! I wish to God, you might happen
to be settled not far from me: a day's-journey distance, however; I mean,
an <HI>easy</HI> one. But the odds are infinitely against me. I must only
<HI>rely</HI> for my happiness on the hopes of a never-ceasing
correspondence!</P>
<P>Soon after you were gone, I received my packet. The history of
Worcestershire is mere stuff. T— I am so fond of, that, I
believe, I shall have his part of the collection bound over again, neatly and
separately. But sure Hammond has no right to the least <HI>inventive</HI>
merit, as the preface-writer would insinuate. I do not think there is a
single thought, of any eninence, that is not literally translated. I am
astonished he could not content himself with be∣ing so little an
original.</P>
<P>Mr. Lyttleton and his lady are at Hagley. A malignant caterpillar
has demolished the beauty of all our <HI>large</HI> oaks. Mine are secured
by their littleness. But, I guess, the park suf¦fers; a large wood near
me being a mere win∣ter-piece for nakedness.</P>
<P>At present, I give myself up to riding and thoughtlessness;
being resolved to make trial of <HI>their</HI> efficacy towards a tolerable
degree of health <PB N="67" REF="80"/> and spirits. I wish I had you for my
director. I should proceed with great confidence of suc∣cess; though I am
brought very low by two or three fits of a fever since I saw you. Had I
written to you in the midst of my dispirited condition, as I was going, you
would have had a more tender and unaffected letter than I <HI>can</HI> write at
another time: what I think, perhaps, at all times; but what sickness can
alone elicit from a temper fearful of whining.</P>
<P>Surely the 
<Q REND="inline">"nunc formosissimus annus"</Q> is to be
limited to hay-harvest. I could give my rea∣sons: but you will imagine them
to be the acti∣vity of country people in a pleasing employ∣ment; the full
verdure of the summer; the prime of pinks, woodbines, jasmines, &amp;c. I
am old, very old; for few things give me so much mechanical pleasure as
lolling on a bank in the very heat of the sun, 
<Q> 
<L>When the old come forth to play</L> 
<L>On a sun-shine holiday—</L></Q> And yet it is as much
as I can do to keep Mrs. Arnold from going to neighbouring houses in her
smock, in despite of decency, and my known disapprobation.</P>
<P>I find myself more of a patriot than I ever thought I was. Upon
reading the account of the battle, I found a very sensible pleasure, or,
as the Methodists term it, perceived my heart <HI>enlarged,</HI> &amp;c. The
map you sent me is a pretty kind of <HI>toy,</HI> but does not enough
particularize the scenes of the war, &amp;c. which was the end I had in view
when I sent for it.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">"O dura messorum ilia!"</Q> About half the
appetite, digestion, strength, spirits, &amp;c. of a mower, would make me
the happiest of mortals! I would be understood literally, and

<SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM tempted to begin my letter as Mem∣mius does his harangue: 
<Q REND="inline">"Multa medehor∣tantur à vobis, ni studium
virtutis vestrae om∣nia exsuperet."</Q> You contrive interviews of about a
minute's duration; and you make ap∣pointments in order to disappoint one; and
yet, at the same time that your proceedings are thus vexatious, force one to
bear testimony to the inestimable value of your friendship! I do
in∣sist upon it, that you ought to compound for the disappointment you
have caused me, by a little letter every post you stay in town. I shall
now scarce see you till next summer, or spring at soonest; and then
I may probably take occa∣sion to visit you, under pretence of seeing
Der∣byshire. Truth is, your prints have given me <HI>some</HI> curiosity
to see the original places. I am grateful for your intentions with regard to
giv∣ing me part of them, and impertinent in desiring you to convey them to me
as soon as you can well spare them. Let me know if they are sold
separately at the print shops. I think to recom∣mend them to my new
acquaintance, Mr. Lyt∣tleton Brown. I like the humour of the ballad you
mention, but am more obliged for your partial opinion of me. The notes that
fall upon the word 
<Q REND="inline">"Cannon, Cannon,"</Q> are ad∣mirably expressive
of the sound, I dare say: I mean, jointly with its echo; and so, I
suppose, you will think, if you ever attended to the Tower-guns. I find I
cannot afford to go to Bath pre∣viously to my London-journey; though I look
upon it as a proper method to make my resi∣dence in town more agreeable. I
shall, probably, <PB N="69" REF="82"/> be there about the first of December;
or before, if I can accelerate my friend Whistler's jour∣ney. The pen I write
with is the most disagree∣able of pens! But I have little else to say;
only this,—that our good friend, Jack Dolman, is dead at Aldridge; his
father's benefice.</P>
<P>I beg, if you have leisure, you would inclose me in a frank the
following songs, with the notes: 
<Q REND="inline">"Stella and Flavia," "Gentle Jessy," "Sylvia,
wilt thou waste thy prime?"</Q> and any other that is new. I should be glad
of that number of the British Orpheus which has my song in it, if it does
not cost above sixpence. Make my compliments to your brother and

<SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU may reasonably have expected a letter before now, either as an
acknowledgment for your genteel present, or, at least, by way of
information that I had received it. The prints have given me a pleasure,
which, however con∣siderable, would soon have languished, if I had bought
them at a shop; but which is now built upon the esteem I have for the
giver, and can∣not have a more durable foundation.—As for 
<PB N="70" REF="83"/> the rest, I am most pleased with the view of
Matlock, and shall have no peace of mind till I have seen the original. I
have been gilding the frames, and wishing all the while for your
com∣pany.</P>
<P>I will alter the ballad according to your ad∣vice; dividing it into
three parts, and adding a stanza or two to the shortest, some time or
other. I have had no opportunity of trying the tunes. 
<Q REND="inline">"Arno's vale"</Q> has pretty words, and recommends
itself to one's imagination by the probability that it was written on a real
occa∣sion. The similitude of rhimes in the close in∣excusable. For all
that has been the subject of my letter hitherto, as the country people say,
I can but thank you, and I do very sincerely; though as to the songs I will
repay you.</P>
<P>I have your poem by me, which I have read often with the greatest
pleasure. I have many observations to make; and only defer the
com∣munication till I know whether you have a copy at Tissington to turn
to. I think, the most <HI>polite</HI> and <HI>suitable</HI> title to it
would run:—
<Q REND="inline">"The Villa, a Poem; containing a Sketch of the
present Taste in Rural Embellishments, written in 1740."</Q> Your preface
has a pretty thought to∣wards the close; otherwise is on no account to be
admitted. Pardon my freedom; but, I think, there is no manner of occasion for
a pre∣face; and those strokes, which I <HI>know</HI> to be real modesty
in <HI>you,</HI> the world will undoubtedly impute to affectation.—If you
give me encou∣ragement, I will be very minute in my criticisms, allowing you
to reject ten to one that you ad∣mit of.</P>
<P>Whistler is gone to Bristol, and has bilked me.—I said,
he is gone; but, I believe, he is only upon going.—I linger at home, in
hopes of gleaning up a little health; and through a dread of being ill in a
place where I can be less <PB N="71" REF="84"/> attended on.—I can
continually <HI>find out</HI> some∣thing in my preceding diet that, I
<HI>think,</HI> disor∣ders me; so that I am constantly in hopes of
growing well:—but, perhaps, I never shall; 
<Q> 
<L>Optima quaeque dies miseris mortalibus aevi</L> 
<L><HI>Prima</HI> fugit, subeunt morbi—</L></Q></P>
<P>When I was a school-boy, I never knew there <HI>was any such
thing</HI> as perspiration; and now, half my time is taken up in
considering the im∣mediate connexion betwixt that and health, and
endeavouring to promote it.</P>
<P>Mr. Lyttelton has built a kind of alcove in his park, inscribed, 
<Q REND="inline">"SEDES CONTEMPLATIO∣NIS,"</Q> near his hermitage.
Under the afore∣said inscription is 
<Q REND="inline">"OMNIA VANITAS:"—</Q>the sides ornamented
with sheeps' bones, jaws, sculls, &amp;c. festoon wise. In a nitch over
it, an owl.</P>
<P>As to schemes, I have none with regard to the world, women, or
books. And I hate, and have deferred writing to you (for some days) for that
reason. I am sick of exhibiting so much sameness:—I am
constantly poring over some Classic, which I consider as one of
Idleness's better shapes. But I am impatient to be doing something that
may tend to better my situation in some respect or other. It is
<HI>encouragement</HI> can alone inspire one. 
<Q> 
<L>Multa &amp; praeclare minantem</L> 
<L>Vivere nec <HI>recte,</HI> nec <HI>suaviter</HI>—</L></Q> expresses the whole of me. Thus my epistles persevere in the
plaintive style; and I question whether the sight of them does not, ere
now, give you the vapours. I have an old aunt that visits me sometimes,
whose conversation is the perfect counterpart of them. She shall fetch a

<HEAD>XXXVII. To the same, with Observations on Hypocrisy,
&amp;c.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>1743.</DATE></DATELINE> 
<SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU must know, my last letter to you was written before I
received yours from Tis∣sington; and I should take shame upon myself
for not answering it, were I not furnished with this excuse—that I
waited for a frank for you.—There are but few things I have to say to
you, and such as are not worth transcribing; yet, as our distance from
one another requires it, I will scrawl them over as negligently as I can, to
let you see I lay no stress upon them. A good ex∣cuse for laziness!
you will say: and lazy enough I am, God knows! I believe, any one who knows
me thoroughly will think, that there ne∣ver was so great an inconsistence
as there is betwixt my words (in my poem) and my actions.—This is what
the world calls hypocrisy, and is determined to look upon with
<HI>peculiar</HI> aversion. But, I think, the hypocrite is a
<HI>half</HI>-good cha∣racter. A man certainly, considering the force 
<PB N="73" REF="88"/> of precedent, deserves some praise who keeps up
appearances; and is, no doubt, as much to be commended for talking better than
he acts, as he is to be blamed for acting worse than he talks. So much for
casuistry. I would seem, you must know, to have some meritorious
views in talking <HI>virtuously</HI>; but who does not know that every one
who writes poetry looks directly with his face towards praise, and whatever
else his eye takes in is viewed obliquely? Praise, as I said to
foible-confessing W—, is the de∣sired, the noted, and the adequate
reward of poetry; in which sort he that rewards me, Hea∣ven reward him, as
Sir John Falstaff says.—There is something very vain in repeating
my own sayings; but I could not conscientiously use a joke to you which
I had used in another letter, without owning it.—In short, it is
ne∣cessary to have some <HI>earthly</HI> aim in view; the next world,
whether it be in reality near or far off, is always <HI>seen</HI> at a
distance. All that the generality of young people can do is, to act
<HI>consistently with</HI> their expectations there.—Now, though
fame, &amp;c. be obviously enough in the eye of reason dissatisfactory;
yet it is pro∣per enough to suffer one's self to be deluded with the hopes
of it, that is, it is proper to cherish some worldly hopes, that one may
avoid impatience, spleen, and one sort of <HI>despair:</HI> I mean that
of having no <HI>hopes</HI> here, because one sees nothing here that
deserves them. If I were in your case, I would make all the efforts I was
able towards being a Bishop. That should be my earthly aim: not but I would
act with so much indifference as to bear all disappointment
unconcernedly—as, I dare say, you will.—There is but one
passion that I put upon an equally sprightly footing with ambition, and
that is love; which, as it <HI>regularly tends</HI> to ma∣trimony, requires
certain favours from fortune <PB N="74" REF="89"/> and circumstance to render
it proper to indulge in.—By this time you think me crazed—as it
often happens to me to doubt, <HI>seriously,</HI> whether I am not: but if
it be the 
<Q REND="inline">"mentis gratissimus error,"</Q> I do not mind.
You are very oblig∣ing to endeavour to continue my madness and
vanity.—I should be as glad to see Mr. Graves, your brother, as any
one I know: I live in a manner wherein he would find many things to exercise
his good nature.</P>
<P>Pamela would have made one good volume: I wonder the author, who has
some <HI>nice</HI> natu∣ral strokes, should not have sense enough to
see that.—I beg you will collect all the hints, &amp;c. of your own, or
others, that you think may tend to the improvement of my poem against winter;
that you would mention any flat lines, &amp;c.—Write me word some time
ere you come over; but write to me immediately. I am</P>

<P>My ballad, in the midst of your hurry, must appear as ridiculous
as Cinna the poet does, when he swears nothing but death shall restrain
him from addressing Brutus and Cassius (and that the night before the

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>About 1745.</DATE></DATELINE> 
<SALUTE>Dear Mr. Graves,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THERE is not a syllable you tell me con∣cerning yourself in your
last letter, but what applied to <HI>me</HI> is most literally true. I am
sensible of the daily progress I make towards in significancy, and it
will not be many years before you see me arrived at the <HI>ne plus
ultra.</HI> I believe it is absolutely impossible for me to ac∣quire a
considerable degree of knowledge, tho' I can understand things well enough
at the time I read them. I remember a preacher at St. Ma∣ry's (I think it was
Mr. E—) made a notable distinction betwixt <HI>apprehension</HI> and
<HI>comprehension.</HI> If there be a real difference, probably it may find a
place in the explication of my genius. I envy you a good <HI>general</HI>
insight into the writings of the learned. I must aim at nothing higher than
a well concealed ignorance.—I was think∣ing, upon reading your letter,
<HI>when</HI> it was that you and Mr. Whistler and I went out of the road of
happiness. It certainly was where we first deviated from the turnpike road
of life.—Wives, children, alliances, visits, &amp;c. are ne∣cessary
objects of our social passions; and whe∣ther or no we can, through
particular circum∣stances, be happy <HI>with,</HI> I think it plain enough
that it is not possible to be happy <HI>without</HI> them. All attachments
to inanimate beauties, to curio∣sities, and ornaments, satiate us
presently.—The fanciful tribe has the disadvantage to be natu∣rally
prone to err in the choice of <HI>lasting</HI> plea∣sures: and when our
passions have habitually wandered, it is too difficult to reduce them into
their proper channels. When this is the case, nothing but the change or
variety of amusements stands any chance to make us easy, and it is not 
<PB N="78" REF="93"/> long ere the whole species is exhausted.—I agree
with you entirely in the necessity of a <HI>sociable</HI> life in order
to be happy. I do not think it much a paradox, that any company is better than
<HI>none.</HI> I think it obvious enough as to the pre∣sent hour, and as to
any future influence, soli∣tude has exceeding savage effects on our
dispo∣sitions.—I have wrote out my elegy: I lay no manner of
stress but upon the piety of it.—Would it not be a good kind of
motto, applied to a person you know, that might be taken from what is said
of <HI>Ophelia</HI> in <HI>Hamlet,</HI> 
<Q> 
<L>I tell thee, faithless priest!</L> 
<L>A ministring angel shall Ophelia be</L> 
<L>When thou art howling.</L></Q></P>
<P>I have amused myself often with this species of writing
since you saw me; partly to divert my present <HI>impatience,</HI> and
partly as it will be a picture of most that passes in my mind; a
por∣trait which <HI>friends</HI> may value.—I should be glad of your
profile: if you have objections, I drop my request.—I should be
heartily glad if you would come and live with me, for any space of time that
you could find convenient.—But I will depend on your coming over with Mr.
Whistler in the spring. I may possibly take a jaunt towards you ere
long: the road would furnish me out some visits; and, by the time I
reached you, perhaps, afford me a kind of cli∣max of happiness. If I do not,
I shall perhaps be a little time at Bath. I do not speak of this last as
a scheme from which I entertain great expectations of pleasure. It is long
since I have considered myself as <HI>undone.</HI> The <HI>world</HI>
will not perhaps consider me in that light entirely, till I have married my
maid. Adieu!</P>

<SALUTE>Dear Mr. Graves,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>MY life, for aught I see, will pass away just as it
<HI>has</HI> done, without introducing sufficient improvement into my
circumstances to give a chearful cast to my correspondence. In
<HI>one</HI> respect, in regard to my inviolable friend∣ship for
<HI>you,</HI> I hope you will hear with some satisfaction, that I continue
still the same. And this kind of <HI>idenity,</HI> I think, I could
promise you, though every circumstance in my fortune, every particle of my
body, were changed; and others, ever so heterogeneous, substituted in
their place. After this, it would be no com∣pliment to say, that the
<HI>pretended</HI> heir to these kingdoms could not alter it, were he to
subvert the British constitution; which must, out of all doubt, be the
consequence of his success. The rebellion, you may guess, is the
subject of all conversation. Every individual nailer here takes in a
news-paper (a more <HI>pregnant</HI> one by far than any of the London ones),
and talks as familiarly of <HI>kings</HI> and <HI>princes</HI> as ever Master
Shallow did of John Gaunt. Indeed it is no bad thing that they do so; for I
cannot con∣ceive that the people want so much to be con∣vinced by
<HI>sermons,</HI> of the absurdities of <HI>popery,</HI> as they do by
<HI>news-papers,</HI> that <HI>it</HI> may <HI>possibly</HI> prevail. The
reasons and arguments too in fa∣vour of the present Government are so
<HI>strong</HI> and <HI>obvious,</HI> that even I, and every country
'squire, and every country clerk, and Sam Shaw the taylor, seem to be as
much masters of them as the Bishops themselves. I must not say we
could express them so politely.—I like <PB N="80" REF="95"/> Secker's
the best of any sermon on this occa∣sion. He gives his audience a view of
such evil consequences from a <HI>change,</HI> as no man of sense can
possibly doubt of, when fairly stated: and, I own, I cannot see one

<P>I have often thoughts of a jaunt as far as your country this winter.
Some kind of pilgrimage I must make, to avoid a lethargy.—Public places
I want to visit a little; to peep at and renew my ideas of the
<HI>world's</HI> vanity; but either Bath or London would steep me so far in
po∣verty, that I should not probably emerge before the middle of next
summer. I have spent this last summer agreeably enough with some of
my young relations, Mr. Dolman's children.—They have an excellent taste
for their years.—I have been upon several jaunts with the son to
Ditchfield, Worcester, Mr. Fletcher's, &amp;c. amus∣ing him, what I could,
under the loss of his father. Miss W— F— asked very
earnestly after you. Two of the sisters have been with me at the
Leasows, and upon several parties of plea∣sure in my chair.—Broom is
disposed of—I do not understand upon what inducement.—After
all, I am miserable;—conscious to myself that I am too little
selfish: that I ought now or ne∣ver to aim at some addition to my
fortune; and that I make large advances towards the common catastrophe of
<HI>better</HI> poets, poverty—I never can attend enough to some
twelve-penny matter, on which a great deal depends.—My amour, so far as
I indulge it, gives me some pleasure, and no pain in the world.—I
have read Spenser once again, and I have added full as much more to my
<HI>School-mistress,</HI> in regard to <HI>number of</HI> 
<PB N="81" REF="96"/> <HI>lines; something</HI> in point of <HI>matter</HI>
(or <HI>manner</HI> ra∣ther) <HI>which</HI> does not displease me. I would
be glad if Mr. — were, upon your request, to give his opinion of
particulars, for two reasons; as you say he has some taste for this
kind of writ∣ing, and as he is my enemy, and would there∣fore, find out its
deficiencies.</P>

you to preserve this letter. Pray write soon, and believe me most

of the Lords Kilmarnock and Balmerino.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>1746, ineunte anno.</DATE></DATELINE> 
<SALUTE>Dear Mr. Graves,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I BELIEVE it is impossible for me to dis∣agree with you on any
other score, than the scanty pittances you allot me of your compa∣ny; and,
if I have disclosed any symptoms of resentment on that account, you
will, perhaps, overlook them, out of regard to the motive from which they
proceeded.—I thank you for your perusal of that trivial poem. If I were
going to print it, I should give way to your remarks <HI>implicitly,</HI> and
would not <HI>dare</HI> to do other∣wise. But so long as I keep it in
manuscript, you will pardon my silly prejudices, if I chuse to read and
shew it with the addition of most of my new stanzas. I own, I have a
fondness for several, imagining them to be <HI>more</HI> in Spenser's
way, yet more independent on the antique <PB N="82" REF="97"/> phrase, than
any part of the poem; and, on that account, I cannot yet prevail on myself to
banish <HI>them</HI> entirely; but were I to print, I should (with
<HI>some</HI> reluctance) give way to your sentiments (which I know are
just), namely, that they render the work too diffuse and flimsy, and
seem rather excrescences than essential parts of it.</P>
<P>But of these things I say no more now. I purpose staying a
month with Mr. Whistler in December, if it suits him; and then I hope I
shall have a great deal of your company. Let me hear something in your next
of your <HI>domestic affairs.</HI> I beg you would not make any grand
decision, without giving me some previous in∣formation. I esteem this as
due to the friend∣ship I have so long professed for you, and from the
friendship you have so long professed for me.</P>
<P>I look upon the death of the two Lords as equally decent upon their
respective principles. Lord Kilmarnock, I suppose, joined the rebels
through a view of bettering his circumstances, conscious to himself that
he was guilty of a crime the moment he did so. This is agreeable to his
speech before the Lords, and to that me∣lancholy which he discovered upon
the scaffold. Death, aggravated by guilt, would sit heavier upon him than
upon the other, even supposing him to have had the same resolution.
Balme∣rino's life was quite <HI>unie,</HI> and his death equal to the character
he aimed at. We are to observe, that he meant to suffer as a Friend to the
Stu∣arts, a Soldier, and a Scotsman. The first he manifested when he came
out of the Tower, by his reply of 
<Q REND="inline">"God save King J—s;"</Q> the second, by
his dress, and numberless ostentations of in∣trepidity; the last, by
his plaid night-cap. Did you hear the story of his sending a message to
Lord Kilmarnock? 
<Q REND="inline">"that he had been practising <PB N="83" REF="98"/>
how to lye upon the block, and had found out, the easiest way of receiving
the blow was, to bite his tongue hard: or even if he bit it off, it was no
matter, they should have no farther use for it."</Q> His behaviour seems
to have wanted coolness, or else to equal that of Adrian, Cato, Sir T.
More, &amp;c. or any of those heroes who had spirit enough to make an
ostentation of their unconcern. I had, from the printed accounts of their
behaviour, an idea of their persons, exactly consormable to the
de∣scription I read afterwards in your paper;—but enough—you
send me sterling matters of fact, and I return you tinsel
observations.—I thank you for accenting Crōmêrtie and
Balmērīno; I learnt Culloden from you <HI>before.</HI></P>
<P>I have had little company since I saw you.—One day indeed
I was surprized by a visit from Mr. Thomson, Author of the
Seasons.—Mr. Lyttelton introduced him.—I have not room to tell
you all that passed.—They praised my place
extravagantly;—proposed alterations, &amp;c. Thomson was very
facetious, and very complaisant; invited me to his house at Rich∣mond.
There were many things said worth <HI>telling,</HI> but not <HI>writing</HI>
to you.—This has been a summer that I have spent more
<HI>socially</HI> than any one these three years. I expect a good deal more
company this week, the next, and the week after.—Lady Luxborough talks of
coming, and I believe <HI>will,</HI>—The visit would bring my little
walks into repute.—When will the time come, that I shall enjoy your
company here a month uninterrupted? Dear Sir,</P>

<OPENER>
<SALUTE>Dear Mr. Graves,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE lately received a letter from Mr. Whistler, which conveys
your compliments to me, and, by so doing, prompts me to ac∣knowledge the
receipt of your last kind letter. I observe you adhere strictly to the
apostolical precept of being 
<Q REND="inline">"swift to <HI>hear,</HI> slow to
<HI>speak</HI>;"</Q> the latter part of which I would fain conclude you
understand too literally.</P>
<P>Your neighbour, I see, is not a little embar∣rassed with his
mills at Whitchurch. I have long had an eye upon his advertisement in the
London Evening Post, and been not a little scan∣dalized thereat. What has
the name of a poet to do with the publication of lands and tene∣ments? or the
idea of harmony with the noise of a water-mill? yet has he extracted music
from the subject, and mirth from his misfor∣tunes; having sent me a
ballad upon the miller, written with much ease and some drollery.</P>
<P>As to the light in which you place your pre∣sent fortunes, I can
only say, that you have not that situation I could wish you for your
<HI>own sake:</HI> for so far as <HI>I</HI> am concerned in your
ele∣vation, I can assure you very faithfully, that no circumstances in
the world could more endear you to my affection, or recommend you to my
respect, than the present. My <HI>affection,</HI> you will easily
observe, from the very <HI>nature</HI> of affec∣tion in general, would
stand no chance to be increased by your promotion; and as for respect, if
I knew the degree you desired, I would ac∣quit myself of it to your
satisfaction <HI>now</HI>; and were you settled at <HI>Lambeth,</HI> I
should expect that you would require no <HI>more</HI> from me upon that 
<PB N="85" REF="100"/> account; at least in private: so that, so far as
either <HI>deference</HI> or <HI>friendship</HI> is concerned, you are an
Archbishop to <HI>me</HI> to all intents and pur∣poses.—As to figure
in the world, it depends much, I know, upon advancement; and yet even here you
will be ever <HI>sure</HI> of that kind of weight which ingenuity gives;
discernable to the <HI>smaller</HI> indeed, but undoubtedly the more
<HI>valuable</HI> part of the world;—but this is impro∣per, as it is
<HI>philosophy,</HI> and as it is <HI>advice;</HI> neither of which is it
suitable for me to suggest to you—
<Q REND="inline">"Alcinoo Poma, &amp;c."</Q> As to the long series
of <HI>my</HI> lamentations, I will not now enter upon the reasonableness
of them. It is a subject, to tell you the truth, on which you cannot reply
with∣out some danger of hurting me.—As for poli∣tics (you will blame
this letter for dwelling so much upon the subject of yours;) but as for
politics, I think <HI>poets</HI> are <HI>tories</HI> by nature, sup∣posing
them to be by nature poets.—The love of an individual person or family,
that has worn a crown for many successions, is an inclination greatly
adapted to the fanciful tribe. On the other hand, mathematicians,
abstract-reasoners, of no manner of attachment to persons, at least to
the <HI>visible</HI> part of them, but prodigiously de∣voted to the ideas
of virtue, liberty, and so forth, are generally <HI>whigs.</HI> It happens
agreea∣bly enough to this maxim, that the whigs are friends to that wise,
plodding, unpoetical people the Dutch.—The Tories, on the other hand, are
taken mightily with that shewy, ostentatious nation the French. Foxhunters,
that reside amongst the beauties of nature, and bid defiance to art, in
short, that have intellects of a poeti∣cal <HI>turn,</HI> are frequently
tories; citizens, mer∣chants, &amp;c. that scarce see what nature is, and
consequently have no pretensions to a poetical taste, are, I think,
generally argumentative and whiggish;—but perhaps I carry this too
far.—<PB N="86" REF="101"/> Something there is in it however, you will
see: not that I would apply what I here say to par∣ticular revolutions,
&amp;c. I would only advance something general and speculative. Nor would I
approve or condemn by this any one set of people now existing. Nor would I
have you pretend to fish out my party from any thing I have said; for I am
of none.—The letter I sent you last was <HI>occasional,</HI> and
when I see you I will tell you the occasion. I absolutely agree with you
in every tittle of your political observations.—I am glad I do; for I
know the poisonous nature of party: and though we are <HI>neither</HI>
vio∣lent, yet I should fear it. My schemes are <HI>doubtful</HI> at
present, but my face is set towards Bath.—I am confident of the
service those wa∣ters would do me.—I hope you will exhilarate me with
a letter soon.—I would fain have fur∣nished out a letter to amuse
you after so long a silence, but I find myself unable: even <HI>as</HI>

<SALUTE>Dear Mr. Graves,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THOUGH I feel an irresistible propen∣sity to write to you this
very post, yet I cannot say that I am able to advance any thing tending
either to your own or my satisfaction.—What is worst of all is, I
cannot fix the time of seeing you with so much precision as I would
always endeavour where my pleasure is so much concerned—I will tell
you the whole affair.—I <PB N="87" REF="102"/> have for a long season
proposed to drink the Bath waters this spring; and <HI>did</HI> think of
set∣ting out in a week's time, when I received your letter, purposing to
stay there a month; and from thence take a circuit which should indulge me
in a sight of you, Mr. Whistler, and some few others in my way home. The
latter part of this scheme (tho' far the more agreeable to me) was rather
doubtful and precarious; depending (as you express it) on the state of my
finances after a month's continuance at Bath; which I considered, and
<HI>do</HI> consider, as a very probable means of bettering my
constitution.—Now I covet to see you so much, that I would bring
nothing but health in competition.—What I wish is, that you could, with
convenience, either <HI>hasten</HI> or <HI>delay</HI> your journey, that you
might find me before mine, or after my return, though I should infinitely,
and for many reasons, prefer the former. I long to talk with you particularly
now. I have much to say in regard to our friend's amour, to which you alluded
in your last. I request it as a favour of you, that you would conjure him,
by the friendship I have ever borne him, and by any esteem which he has
ever professed for me, that he would do nothing very <HI>material</HI> in
the affair till I have talked it over, and given him my faithful sen∣timents,

<Q REND="inline">"quod censet amiculus."</Q></P>
<P>I am not willing the balance should turn en∣tirely on the whig
side: I would give it a grea∣ter equilibrium, if the following suggestion
might effect it. Tories, I said, have great, and sometimes partial
affections for the <HI>person</HI> of a king.—We will suppose that
kings are alter∣nately good and bad: their loyalty to the good one is
commendable; their partiality to the bad one not to be vindicated. Whigs have
<HI>no</HI> pas∣sion, <HI>no</HI> gratitude, towards to the good prince:
there they are wrong. They are severe upon the <PB N="88" REF="103"/> bad one,
in which they are justifiable. I wish I had not begun these wholesale
distinctions, this miserable specimen of my politics. I pro∣test
against all epistolary disputes. I am now embarrassed in one, on much
such another score, which fills up all my letter; for I love the last
word, like a scold or a child.—I thank you for your little anecdotes
from time to time: you may depend upon it, that I have never heard any thing
<HI>before</HI>; for I never <HI>do</HI> hear any thing.—I am one very
thankful letter in debt to your neighbour Whistler. I have at present
nothing but the <HI>propensity</HI> of a good correspondent; but I will
write soon. In the mean time, if you see him, ask him if he goes to Bath
or Bristol this season.—I beg you would write to me di∣rectly
<HI>when</HI> you can come, and how I may re∣gulate my motions so as to be
best assured of seeing you.—Pray do not neglect a post. I

<OPENER><DATELINE>The Leasows,

<SALUTE>Dear Mr. Graves,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is now, I believe, near half a year since I had the favour of a
letter from you. When I wrote last, I discovered a more than ordinary
solicitude for <HI>one</HI> immediate answer. It puzzles me to account for
your unusual silence, other∣wise than upon supposition of some
offence you have taken: and it puzzles me as much to guess by what behaviour
of mine I have been so un∣happy as to give you that offence.</P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="104"/>I am vain enough to imagine that the little
merit I have, deserves somewhat more regard than I have met with from the
world. Be that as it will, the disappointment I must undergo, by any
<HI>appearance</HI> of neglect from the friends I value, would more effectually
dispirit me than any other whatsoever.</P>
<P>I have published my design of visiting you, and Mr. Whistler
in Oxfordshire, to all the world. A thousand incidents have hitherto
in∣terfered with it, which I will not now recount. But when I look back upon
the regular suc∣cession of them, it looks as if Destiny had some hand
in detaining me. The most <HI>vigorous</HI> of my <HI>hopes</HI> dwell upon
seeing you next win∣ter, though I am not a little indulgent to
<HI>those</HI> that tell me I may see you long before.</P>
<P>I have brought my place here to greater per∣fection than it has ever
yet appeared in; and, with the <HI>mob,</HI> it is in some vogue.
Neverthe∣less, I do not know that I ever relished it less in my life than
I have done this summer. Bad health, bad spirits, no company to my mind,
and no correspondences, are enough to blast the sweetest shades, and
to poison the purest fountains. Some of these misfortunes I can im∣pute
to my own misconduct, and it embitters them. The two last I can less
account for, ha∣ving at all times done all I was able to recom∣mend myself to
my <HI>friends,</HI> behaving at the same time with courtesy to the rest
of the world. The fact is not true; otherwise I might resolve it into this,
that I alone am idle, and all the world is <HI>busy.</HI></P>
<P>I fancy you will imagine I lay too much stress upon Mr.
Thomson's visit, when I mention the following inscription upon a seat
in Virgil's grove.

is a silver coin, but very obscure.—There appears a large mass of

you were here, it might amuse you.</P>
<P>Heaviness may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the
morning.—I have so settled a notion of the proportionate mixture of
pleasure and pain in this life, that I expect one to suc∣ceed the other as
naturally as day and night. I own, this is owing to the soul as much as to
outward incidents. Sorrow prepares it for mirth, and <HI>vice
versa.</HI>—The durations of both differ. Last summer I spent
agreeably; this quite otherwise, To-day I have been quite me∣lancholy; I
expect happiness to-morrow from either an aptitude of mind, or some

<SALUTE>Dear Mr. Graves,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM under some apprehension that you dread the sight of a
letter from me, as it seems to lay claim to the compliment of an answer. I
will therefore write you one that shall wave its <PB N="92" REF="107"/>
privilege, at least till such time as your leisure encourages, or your
present dissipation does not forbid you to send one.—I dare now
no longer expatiate upon the affair you have in hand; it is enough for me, if
you will excuse the free∣dom I <HI>have</HI> taken. I have often known
<HI>delay</HI> produce good effects in some cases which even sagacity
itself could not surmount; and, if I thought I did not go too far, would
presume to recommend it now. You know I have very little of the temper of an
alderman. I almost hate the <HI>idea</HI> of wealthiness as much as the
<HI>word.</HI> It seems to me to carry a notion of ful∣ness, stagnation,
and insignificancy. It is this disposition of mine that can
<HI>alone</HI> give any weight to the advice I send you, as it proves me not
to give it through any partiality to fortune. As to what remains, you are, I
hope, assured of the value I must ever have for you in <HI>any</HI>
circum∣stances, and the regard I shall always shew for any that belongs
to you. I cannot like you <HI>less</HI> or <HI>more.</HI>—I now drop
into other matters. Ber∣gen, I see, is taken at lost; pray what are the
sentiments of your political companions? I dined some time ago with Mr.
Lyttelton and Mr. Pitt, who both agreed it was worth twenty thousand men to
the French; which is a light in which I never used to consider it. Any
little intimation that you please to <HI>confer</HI> upon me, en∣ables me to
seem <HI>wise</HI> in this country for a month; particularly if I take care
to adjust my face accordingly. As I was returning last Sun∣day from church,
whom should I meet in my way, but that <HI>sweet-souled</HI> bard Mr.
James Thom∣son, in a chaise drawn by two horses lengthways.—I
welcomed him into the country, and asked him to accompany Mr. Lyttelton to
the Leasows (who had offered me a visit) which he promised to do. So I am
in daily expectations of them and all the world this week. I fancy they will 
<PB N="93" REF="108"/> lavish all their praises upon <HI>nature,</HI>
reserving none for poor <HI>art</HI> and <HI>me.</HI> But if I ever live, and
am able to perfect my schemes, I shall not despair of pleasing the
sew I first began with; <HI>the few friends prejudiced in my favour,</HI>
and then 
<Q REND="inline">"Fico por los malignatores."</Q> Censures will not
affect me; for I am armed so strong in <HI>va∣nity,</HI> that they will
pass by me as the idle wind which I regard not. I think it pretty near equal,
in a country place, whether you gain the small number of tasters, or the
<HI>large crowd</HI> of the vul∣gar. The latter are more frequently met with,
and <HI>gape, stupent,</HI> and <HI>stare</HI> much more. But one would
chuse to please a few <HI>friends</HI> of taste before mob or gentry, the
great vulgar or the small; because therein one gratifies both one's
social passions and one's pride, that is, one's <HI>self</HI>-love.
Above all things, I would wish to please <HI>you;</HI> and if I have a
wish that projects or is pro∣minent beyond the rest, it is to see you
placed to your satisfaction near me; but Fortune must vary from her usual
treatment before she favours me so far.—And yet there <HI>was</HI> a
time, when one might probably have prevailed on her. I knew not what to
do—The affair was so intricately circumstanced—your
surprizing silence after the hint I gave.—Mr. D— offering to
serve any friend of mine; nay, pressing me to use the
op∣portunity.—His other relations, his guardians, teizing him with sure
symptoms of a rupture in case of a refusal on <HI>their</HI>
side.—Mr P— solicit∣ing me if the place were <HI>sold,</HI>
which it could not legally be. Friendship, propriety, imparti∣ality,
self-interest (which I <HI>little</HI> regarded) endea∣vouring to
distract me; I think I never spent so disagreeable an half-year since
I was born. To close the whole, I could not <HI>foresee</HI> the event,
which is almost foretold in your last letter, and I knew I could not
serve you; but I must ren∣der it a <HI>necessary</HI> one. In short,
when can tell <PB N="94" REF="109"/> you the whole affair at leisure, you will
own it to be of such a nature, that I must be ever in sus<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ence concerning my behaviour, and of

<P>IT is not much above two hours since I re∣ceived your obliging
letter, and I am al∣ready set down to answer it.—To speak the
truth, I had almost given you over: I imagined you had taken umbrage at
some expression or circum∣stance in my epistle, and were determined
to make me sensible you did so, by your silence. I hope, this error of
mine will serve to establish one rule on <HI>both</HI> sides.—It
is what ought, I am sure, always to take place, where people wish a
perpetuity of friendship. I mean, never, upon circumstances of
disrespect, to admit of circum∣stantial evidence.</P>
<P>I am very grave, so you may depend on the sincerity of all I
shall say, I saw several beau∣ties in your former elegy; but though it
was 
<Q REND="inline">"formosa,"</Q> it did not appear to me

this, with a sew alterations, that I could pro∣pose:—but you must
know, at the same time, <PB N="95" REF="110"/> that these are such as no
one would approve beside myself.—I know it. However there are some
seeming <HI>faults</HI> in it.</P>
<P>I have been greatly mortified in my correspon∣dents of late.
—I even said in my haste, All friends are faithless.—G, after
a month's ex∣pectation, which he had confirmed to me, of seeing him here, let
me know about a fortnight since, that I had more leisure than him; and
since it did not suit his convenience to come, I ought to take the
opportunity of visiting him, and seeing Derbyshire while he continues in
it.—W— has not wrote to me these six weeks.—Outing has
been, moreover, dumb for the same space of time; and I purpose in my
heart to behave with some distance toward both, for this neglect (see my

<P>It is a pity you cannot spare a day or two to come and see me.

because nobody will come that can taste it.</P>
<P>Your health, according to your description, is much the same
with mine; but from the gaiety of your style and <HI>designs,</HI> I
collect that it is greatly better.</P>
<P>I have an alcove, six elegies, a seat, two epi∣taphs (one upon
myself), three ballads, four songs, and a serpentine river, to shew you
when you come. Will the compositions come safe to you, if I send my book,
which contains the <HI>only</HI> copies of several things (which I could not
re∣member if they were lost)?—but I will not send them. If my horse
gets well, I may essay a visit for two days, and bring them with me, that
I may make comments while you read them, as beseemeth a genuine author to
do.</P>
<P>I am raising a green-house from the excrescen∣ces of Lord
Dudley's; but I do not find that <PB N="96" REF="111"/> 
<Q REND="inline">"vient l'appetit en mangeant,"</Q> that I grow
fonder of my collection proportionable as it in∣creases.</P>
<P>I should think myself fortunate enough at pre∣sent, if, like
you, I could only find that I had been mentioned for a vacant post; but I
have withdrawn all my views from court-preferment, and fixed them on finding a
pot of money, which I determine to be the far more probable scheme.</P>
<P>I have little health and frequent mortification, so that no one
need envy me; and yet, I be∣lieve, there <HI>are</HI> that do Are any enviable
but such as are unambitious? I never shall be able to reckon myself of
that tribe, which have en∣grossed all <HI>happiness</HI> to themselves,
and left the rest of the world nothing but hopes and posses∣sions.
Yet I do not much feel the pains of am∣bition, while I am conversing with
ingenious friends of my own level: but in <HI>other</HI> company it hurts me.
Let me advise you, now I think of it, to dread the company of silly people,
out-of-the-way people, and, in one word, what men of genius <HI>call the
vulgar.</HI> You run ten times the risque of being mortified, voluntarily or
unknow∣ingly, amongst the latter of these, to what you do amongst men of

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>It is somewhere about the 20th of Sept.
1747,</DATE> and I write from The Leasows,</DATELINE> 
<SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I THINK I have lived to out correspond almost all my
correspondents; whether you are the last that is to be subdued, I will
not say; <PB N="97" REF="112"/> the rest are so fatigued, that they are
not able to atchieve a line. Apprized of this, and being by nature disposed
to have mercy on the vanquished, 
<Q REND="inline">"parcere subjectis,"</Q> I seldom write a
syllable more than is requisite to further some scheme, or ascertain
some interview, the latter of these be∣ing the purpose of <HI>this</HI>
mine epistle. I am in great hopes I shall be at liberty to see you ere
many weeks be past; and would beg of you, in the mean time, to inform me, by
a letter, when I am likely, or when very <HI>unlikely,</HI> to meet you at
home. I am detained, just at present, by con∣tinual expectations of the
Hagley family.</P>
<P>As I was returning from church on Sunday last, whom should I
meet in a chaise, with two horses lengthways, but that right friendly bard,
Mr. Thompson? I complimented him upon his arrival in this country, and
asked him to accom∣pany Mr. Lyttelton to The Leasows, which he said he
would with abundance of pleasure; and so we parted. You will observe,
that the more stress I lay upon this visit, and the more I
<HI>discover</HI> to you, the more substantial is my apology for
deferring mine into Warwickshire. I own, I am pleased with the prospect
of shewing them something at The Leasows beyond what they ex∣pect. I have
begun my terras on the high hill I shewed you, made some considerable
improve∣ments in Virgil's grove, and finished a walk from it to the house,
after a manner which you will approve. They are going to build a castle in
the park round the lodge, which, if well exe∣cuted, must have a good effect;
and they are going likewise to build a rotund to terminate the visto. The
fault is, that they anticipate every thing which I propose to do when I
become <HI>rich</HI>; but as that is never likely to be, perhaps it is not of
any importance;—but what I term <HI>rich,</HI> im∣plies no great deal; I
believe, you are a witness to the moderation of my desires; and I flatter 
<PB N="98" REF="113"/> myself that you will believe your friend in
<HI>that</HI> respect something above the vulgar.</P>

<P>If I come to your house, positively I will not go to see Mr.
M—. He has been twice as near me as The Grange, with C— L—,
and never deemed my place worth seeing. I doubt, you are a little too
modest in praising it wherever you go.—Why don't you applaud it with
both hands,

place, that it seems a miracle to me that it is not more famous. But I
complain unjust∣ly of you; for, as you have always contributed to my
happiness, you have taken every opportu∣nity to contribute to my figure. I
wish I could say the same of some who have it <HI>more</HI> in their
<HI>power.</HI></P>
<P>I have yet about a thousand things to say to you—not now,
though.—Lady L—h's visit I reserve till I see you. A coach
with a coronet is a pretty kind of phaenomenon at my door—few prettier,
except the face of such a friend as you; for I do not want the grace to
prefer a generous and spirited friendship to all the gew∣gaws that ambition
can <HI>contrive.</HI> I have wrote out my elegies, and heartily wish you had
them to look over before I come.—I know not how to send them.—I

<P>The agreeableness of your letters is now heightened by the

only favour me with such a letter now and then, and I will place you (in my

<P>I think I could add about half a dozen hints to your observations

then why will you not put it into some news-paper, or monthly pamphlet? you

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Sunday, Feb. 14, 1747-8.</DATE></DATELINE> 
<SALUTE>Dear Mr. Jago,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM tempted once more to apologize for the the unseasonable
visit I paid you, though I feel myself entirely innocent in that respect,
even as much as the post-boy was guilty; for had my previous letter arrived
in due time, you had then been furnished with an opportunity of waving my
company till a more convenient season. I was <HI>only,</HI> or, at least,
<HI>chiefly</HI> uneasy upon <HI>your</HI> ac∣count. I spent my time very
agreeably, and only less so than I might, had I not been con∣scious to
myself, that I was intruding upon do∣mestic tendernesses.</P>
<P>I spent the Sunday night and the next day at Mr. Wren's; and am
now just returned from Mr. Dolman's, who has made me a genteel present of
Spence's Polymetis. I have not yet <HI>read</HI> many dialogues in it, but I
have <HI>dipped</HI> in several; and have reason to be well enough
satisfied with the simple and uninvidious manner in which he has introduced
Mr. Lowth's poem. I have long <PB N="102" REF="117"/> known of this intended
<HI>introduction</HI> (which I acci∣dentally found to have to have been
settled be∣twixt them before I published <HI>mine</HI> on the same
subject), and a little dreaded the <HI>form</HI> of it. I have long ago made
considerable improvements in mine, and have a mind one day to publish it
once more; after which, let it sleep in peace. I have sometimes thought of
printing my next title-page thus, viz. 
<Q REND="inline">"Poems; consisting of Songs, Odes, and Elegies,
with an improved edition of The Judgment of Hercules, and of The
Shool-mistress."</Q> But I have but very few critical acquaintance, and I
live at a great dis∣tance from those I have; stationed amongst the
<HI>makers</HI> and the <HI>wearers</HI> of hob-nails; 
<Q> 
<L>Far from the joys that with my soul agree,</L> 
<L>From <HI>wit,</HI> from <HI>learning</HI>—very far from
thee.</L> 
<BIBL>PARNELL.</BIBL></Q> I know I have thrown a great number of
care∣less things into your hands. I know to <HI>whom</HI> I intrusted my
follies; but I know <HI>not</HI> what they <HI>are:</HI>—I believe, in
general, that they consist of mis-begotten embryos and abortive births,
which it had been merely decent to have buried in—some part of my
garden; but I was morally assured, that you would expose nothing of mine
to my disadvantage. As to some that are <HI>less im∣perfect,</HI> you
promised your observations, and I desire you would make them with the
utmost freedom. I can bear any censure which you shall pass by way of
letter, and I beg once more that you would not be sparing. It will be
esteemed as great a favour as you can do me. When they have gone through your
hands, and those of one or two more friends, I shall, per∣haps, think of
publishing them; though as to that, much depends upon the advice I receive,
and previously on the opportunity I have of re∣ceiving. <PB N="103" REF="118"/> I am in hopes that you will be pretty full in discovering to me,
<HI>which you dislike the least, what faults you find,</HI> and <HI>what
improvements they are capable of.</HI> I set you a tedious task; but I will
return the favour as far as I am able, either in the <HI>same way</HI> or any
other. This brings me to say, that, if there be any compositions of yours
that you would have me to correct (and there are several of which I want a
copy), I would beg you to send them. Your Blackbird excels any singing-bird
I ever heard, and I beseech you to convey it to The Leasows by the next
opportu∣nity, that he may acquire s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me near other <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ills, and
in other valleys, than those in which he was produced.—I have many
compliments to make in your country; to Mr. H—, Mrs. N—, Mrs.
J—, Mr. F—, Mr. T—, and your brother. If I go over to Mr.
W—'s, I will assuredly call and spend a night with
you.—<HI>That</HI> is precarious.—But whether I do or not, I would
willingly hope to see you this spring and summer more than once; as a
<HI>critic</HI> and as a <HI>friend:</HI> nor do I forget the promise of Mr.
H— and Mr. F—;—but of these things more when I send for
the papers, which I purpose to do to-morrow fortnight, that is, the
twenty-ninth of February.</P>
<P>I have suffered greatly by railing at the black button on a
parson's great coat. Had Mr. Hall's been thus distinguished, he could not
have mis∣taken mine for his own; which latter I sent in order to be
commuted at Birmingham, and was almost starved to death before I could
accomplish the exchange. There is no trifling with any <HI>part</HI> of
orthodoxy with impunity.—That is the moral.</P>
<P>I have received a very obliging letter from Lady Luxborough, wherein
she tells me, that Lady Hartford admires my place in her descrip∣tion. Mr.
Thomson is intimate at Lady Hart∣ford's; and I suppose Lady Hartford may
have <PB N="104" REF="119"/> been informed by L. L. that Mr. Thomson has been
here; so I conclude, in mere vanity, that my farm is advancing in
reputation.</P>
<P>What think you of Mr. Carte's History? or what of his narrative
concerning the Pretender's touching for the King's evil? I think one is not,
however, to give up his book entirely; because, with <HI>all his
superstition,</HI> he may have several anec∣dotes that one would like to
read.</P>
<P>I have had great expectations from the beau∣tiful veins of a piece
of oak of which I have had a table made; but, upon a thorough survey of it,
it is so like nothing in the world as old B—'s callimanco
night-gown..</P>
<P>I have nothing to add worth beginning upon another page; but I
happened not to make a re∣gular conclusion in my preceeding one.</P>
<P>You must give me some time to colour you a collection of flowers
(that octavo edition I shewed you here); and then I will make Mrs. Jago a
present of it. I believe I can engage Mr. Dolman to assist me, who is
much my superior in point of accuracy; and the inscription at the beginning
is to run somehow thus: 
<Q> ELEGANTISSIMAE PVELLAE <LB/>DOROTHEA FANCOVRT, <LB/>QVAE PERDILECTI
SVI CONDISCIPVLI <LB/>RICHARDI IAGO <LB/>AMORES MERVIT, <LB/>D. D. <LB/>GVLIELMVS
SHENSTONE; <LB/>DEBITAE NYMPHIS OPIFEX CORONAE.</Q> That is, by trade a
garland-maker; but this in∣scription I may alter, if I can think of any thing
more expressive of the regard which I have ever borne and still bare
you.</P>
<P>Lord Dudley is gone, and franks are no more. I have nothing to
wish you but health and pre∣ferment; <PB N="105" REF="120"/> 
<Q REND="inline">—"det vitam, det opes;—"</Q> with
these you will easily compound that cordial <HI>happiness,</HI> having

<P>I HAVE sent Tom over for the papers which I left under your
inspection; have nothing to to add upon this head, but that the more
<HI>freely</HI> and <HI>particularly</HI> you give me your opinion, the greater
will be the obligation which I shall have to acknowledge.</P>
<P>I shall be very glad, if I happen to receive a good large bundle
of your own compositions; in regard to which, I will observe any commands
which you shall please to lay upon me.</P>
<P>I am favoured with a certain correspondence, by way of letter,
which I told you I should be glad to cultivate; and I find it very
entertaining.</P>
<P>Pray did you receive my answer to your last letter, sent by
way of London? I should be ex∣tremely sorry to be debarred the pleasure
of writing to you by the post, as often as I feel a violent propensity to
describe the notable inci∣dents of my life; which amount to about as much as
the tinsel of your little boy's hobby∣horse.</P>
<P>I am on the point of purchasing a couple of busts for the niches
in my hall; and believe me, my good friend, I never proceed one step in
or∣namenting <PB N="106" REF="121"/> my little farm, but I enjoy the hopes of
rendering it more agreeable to you, and the small circle of acquaintance, who
sometimes favour me with their company.</P>
<P>I shall be extremely glad to see you and Mr. Fancourt when the
trees are green; that is, in May; but I would not have you content your∣self
with a single visit this summer. If Mr. Hardy (to whom you will make my
compli∣ments) inclines to favour me so far, you must calculate so as to
wait on him whenever he finds it convenient; though I have <HI>better
hopes</HI> of mak∣ing his reception here agreeable to him when my Lord Dudley
comes down.—I wonder how he would like the scheme I am upon, of
exchanging a large tankard for a silver standish.</P>
<P>I have had a couple of paintings given me since you were here. One
of them is a Madona, valued, as it is said, at ten guineas in Italy, but
which you would hardly purchase at the price of five shillings. However, I
am endeavouring to make it out to be one of Carlo Maratt's, who was a first
hand, and famous for Madonas; even so as to be nick-named 
<Q REND="inline">"Cartuccio delle Ma∣donne"</Q> by Salvator Rosa.
Two letters of the cypher (CM) agree; what shall I do with regard to the
third? It is a small piece, and sadly black∣ened. It is about the size
(though not quite the shape) of the Bacchus over the parlour door, and has
much such a frame.</P>
<P>A person may amuse himself almost as cheaply as he
pleases. I find no small delight in rearing all sorts of poultry;
geese, turkeys, pullets, ducks, &amp;c. I am also somewhat smitten with
a blackbird which I have purchased: a very sine one; brother by father, but
not by mother, to the unfortunate bird you so beautifully describe, a copy
of which description you must not fail to send me;—but, as I said
before, one may easily habituate one's self to cheap amusements; that 
<PB N="107" REF="122"/> is, <HI>rural</HI> ones (for all town amusements are
hor∣ridly expensive);—I would have you cultivate your garden; plant

that one may not be continually in suspence about the laying out a
<HI>shilling</HI>;—this kind of advice may seem ex∣tremely dogmatical
in <HI>me</HI>; but, if it carries any haughty air, I will obviate it by owning
that I never <HI>acted</HI> as I say. I have lost <HI>my</HI> road to

<HI>leads</HI> the better way, and can shew it others; but I have many miles
to mea∣sure back before I can get into it myself, and no kind of resolution
to take a single step. My chief amusements at present are the same
they have long been, and lie scattered about my farm. The French have what
they call a <HI>parque ornée;</HI> I suppose, approaching about as
near to a garden as the park at Hagley. I give my place the title of a
<HI>ferme ornée;</HI> though, if I had money, I should hardly confine
myself to such decora∣tions as that name requires. I have made great
improvements; and the <HI>consequence</HI> is, that I long to have you see
them.</P>
<P><PB N="109" REF="124"/>I have not heard whether Miss—'s match

<HI>age</HI> and <HI>temper</HI>; and that they had the less weight, as they
supposed you acted indiscreetly yourself: I can say but little on the
occasion. You know—better than I do: Only this I must add, that I
have so great an esteem for your sister, that it will be ne∣cessary
to my <HI>ease,</HI> that whoever marries her she should be happy.</P>
<P>I have little hopes that I shall now see you often in this

<Q>To see the <HI>poorest</HI> of the sons of men.</Q> The
truth is, my affairs are miserably embroiled, by my own negligence, and the
non-payment of tenants. I believe, I shall be forced to seize on one next
week for three years and a half's rent, due last Lady-day; an affair to which
I am greatly averse, but through <HI>indolence</HI> and
<HI>compassion.</HI> I hope, however, I shall be always able (as I am
sure I shall be desirous) to entertain a friend of a <HI>philosophical
regimen,</HI> such as you and Mr. Whist∣ler; and that will be all I can
do.</P>
<P>Hagley-park is considerably improved since you were here, and

two (growing in a wood that joins to the park, and which, fortunately enough,
belongs to Mr. Dolman and me), I believe it may be ren∣dered a considerable

upon my table. I condemn this habit in <HI>myself</HI> entirely, and
should, I am sure, be very unhappy, if my friends, by my example, should
be induced to contract the same. The truth is, I had not expressed
myself in it to my mind, and it was full of blots and blunders, and
interlin∣ings; yet, such as it was, it had wearied my at∣tention, and given
me a disinclination to begin it a fresh. I am now impatient to remove any
scruple you may have concerning my grateful sense of all your favours,
and the invariable continuance of my affection and esteem—I find by
your last obliging letter, that my machina∣tions and devices are not entirely
private.—You knew of my draught of Hagley Castle about the bigness of
a barley-corn; you knew of our in∣tended visit to Lady Luxborough's; and I
must add, Mr. Thomas Hall knew of my contrivance for the embellishment of
Mr. Hardy's house. Nothing is there hid that shall not be
revealed.—Our visit to Barrels is now over and pad.—Lady
Luxborough has seen Hagley Castle in the origi∣nal:—and as to my
desire that my draught might be shewn to no <HI>Christian</HI> soul,
you surely did but ill with it, when you shewed that <HI>drawing</HI> to a 
<PB N="111" REF="126"/> <HI>Clergyman.</HI> However, you may have acted up to my
<HI>real</HI> meaning, if you have taken care not to shew it to any
connoisseur. I meant chiefly to guard against any one that knows the
rules, in whose eyes, I am sure, it would not turn to my credit.—Pray
how do you like the festoons dang∣ling over the oval windows?—It is the
chief advantage in repairing an old house, that one may deviate from the
rules without any extra∣ordinary censure.</P>
<P>I will not trouble you <HI>now</HI> with many particu∣lars. The
intent of Tom's coming is, to desire your company and Mrs. Jago's this
week.—I should be extremely glad if your convenience would allow you to
come on Monday or Tues∣day; but, if it is <HI>entirely</HI> impracticable, I
would beseech you not to put off the visit longer than the Monday
following, for the leaves of my groves begin to fall a great pace. I beg once
more, you would let no small inconvenience prevent your being here on
Monday.—As to my visit at Icheneton, you may depend upon it soon
after; and I hope you will not stand upon punc∣tilio, when I mention my
inclination that you may all take a walk through my coppices before their
beauty is much impaired. Were I in a sprightly vein, I would aim at saying
something genteel by way of <HI>answer</HI> to Mrs. Jago's
compli∣ment.—As it is, I can only thank her for the
<HI>substance,</HI> and applaud the <HI>politeness</HI> of it.—I
post∣pone all other matters till I see you. I am, habi∣tually and

<P><PB N="112" REF="127"/>I thank you very <HI>sensibly</HI> for
the verses with which you honour me. I think them good lines, and so do
others that have seen them; but you will give me leave, when I see you, to
propose some little alteration. As to an epistle, it would be executed
with <HI>difficulty,</HI> and I would have it turn to your credit as well as my
own. But you have certainly of late acquired an <HI>case</HI> in writing; and
I am tempted to think, that what you write henceforth will be universally
good. Persons that have seen your elegies like

most assuredly the most <HI>correct</HI>: but I, who pretend to great

<HI>dead.</HI>—He was to have been at Hagley this week, and then I
should pro∣bably have seen him <HI>here</HI>—As it is, I will erect
an urn in Virgil's Grove to his memory.—I was really as much shocked to
hear of his death, as if I had known and loved him for a number of

<SALUTE>Dear Mr. Jago,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I TAKE this opportunity of acknowledging the justice of your
excuses. Mrs. Jago's pre∣sent circ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>stances render her visit quite imprac∣ticable, and yours I have
the same kind of reason to dispense with; as I guess, that she
could as soon take a journey <HI>herself</HI> at this time, as bear that
<HI>you</HI> should.—But to say I was not greatly 
<PB N="113" REF="128"/> mortified, would be doing myself the greatest
injustice. <HI>Disappointed</HI> I was, you may be sure, to hear
excuses; even as much as Sir John Fal∣staff, when Mr. Dombledon put him in
mind of <HI>security,</HI> instead of sending him <HI>two</HI> and
<HI>thirty yards</HI> of sattin to make him a <HI>short</HI> cloak. And on
the whole, I began to accuse you and Mrs. Jago of <HI>colloguing</HI>
together, to fix your visit at a time when you were well assured you
should have an <HI>apology</HI> to send me instead. Now, if I should
press this accusation, pray how would you evade the force of it?—The
next thing I am to speak to, is your verses. I have made you my
ac∣knowledgments <HI>before</HI>; and as you are so good as to accept them, I
will not trouble you with addi∣tional professions, or repetitions of the
past. I will depend upon your good-sense for an excuse, if I only add
what I think proper as to any <HI>alter∣ation;</HI> wherein I have a view to
<HI>your</HI> credit, as my <HI>own.</HI> I confess, it requires some
nicety to inscribe such an elegy as The Gold-finches with∣out the danger
you foresaw. But I think it <HI>may</HI> be done (and <HI>is</HI> pretty
nearly) in such manner as no man of <HI>taste</HI> will be tempted to
ridicule it; and as for the vulgar, of whatever <HI>rank</HI> they be, it is
absolutely necessary many times to <HI>give them up. Taste</HI> and
<HI>tenderness</HI> are absolutely connected; and you may very readily call
to mind some charming things, that must excite the laughter of your men of
<HI>fire</HI> and <HI>banter,</HI> but are by no means thought the worse of
by men of <HI>true genius.</HI> I will only mention Andrew Marvel's
<HI>Fawn</HI> in Dryden's Miscellanies. I inclose the elegy with some few
proposed alterations, so I will not risque the <HI>silling</HI> my
<HI>letter</HI> with criticism. I also inclose the other verses you
sent me, which I think good ones, and to stand in need of little
alteration, beside that of the inglorious name at the head of them; to which,
notwithstanding, I will never submit. Pray who is the young gen∣tleman 
<PB N="114" REF="129"/> that translates your elegy into Latin?—The new
dress will give you some amusement; and, if these lines <HI>be</HI> the
product of the genius of a boy of that age, he will in a year's time be able to
extend the same of your compositions. I shall then be glad to see the
Gold finches under his hand; though I have no extraordinary fond∣ness for the
Latin poetry of a modern; at least, till your eldest son begins to
translate our ma∣drigals.</P>
<P>I have not yet seen Mr. Thomson's Castle of Indolence.—I
waited for a smaller edition; but am now too impatient not to send for it
on Thursday next.—I am fully bent on raising a neat urn to him in my
lower grove, if Mr. Lyttelton does not inscribe one at Hagley <HI>before</HI>
me. But I should be extremely glad of your advice where∣abouts to place
it.—You speak of my dwelling in the Castle of Indolence, and I verily
believe I <HI>do.</HI> There is something like enchantment in my present
inactivity; for, without any kind of lett or impediment to the correction of my
trifles that I see, I am in no wise able to make the leaft advances. I
think within myself I could pro∣ceed if you were here; and yet I have
reason to believe, if you <HI>were</HI> here, we should only ramble round
the groves, and chat away the time; and perhaps <HI>that,</HI> upon the
<HI>whole,</HI> is of full as much importance.—I do not know but I do
myself some little injustice here, for I <HI>have</HI> wrote out my
<HI>levities,</HI> and my <HI>sonnets,</HI> good and bad, with many ornaments
from the pencil; and the next thing I do will be to transcribe my elegies.
The fault is, I take no pains to <HI>improve</HI> what I tran∣scribe, and,
consequently, am only able to ex∣hibit my nonsense in a fairer
dress.—You must give me leave, ere it be long, to insert two or
three lines (I think in <HI>verse</HI>) before Mrs. Jago's
flower-piece.—I am sure, I am obliged to her for a fruit I greatly
love.—It was not entirely ripe; <PB N="115" REF="130"/> but it was the
only one I have tasted since I was last in London.—Yesterday
dined here Lady Lux∣borough, Mr. Outing and Mr. Hall, Lord Dud∣ley, Miss Lea,
Counsellor Corbet and Mr. San∣ders, Mr. Perry, Mrs. Perry and Miss Dolman,
and half a dozen footmen beside my own ser∣vants and labourers; so you
may guess we had no small fracas. I now sit down amid solitude and
silence, and can hear little else beside the pendulum of my
clock;—yet my spirits are no way sunk, but afford me just such a
temperature of mind as inclines me to write to some familiar friend: albeit I
have a thousand things to <HI>talk</HI> of to you, which I do not care to
<HI>write.</HI> I hope to be able to spend a few days with Mr. Hardy, be∣fore
his melons are all gone; and yet I would not have him keep one a
<HI>moment</HI> longer upon <HI>my</HI> account. I desire he would accept of
my compli∣ments, as I trust he will.—Franks at present run low with
me; but I send you <HI>one,</HI> which you cannot use so soon but I
shall be able to send you others immediately. I wish I could send you
any thing more than the means of obliging,</P>

<SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I MUST fairly own, that I have not sate down till now to return my
acknowledg∣ments for your last most obliging favour; and yet I have been
doing so in <HI>imagination</HI> almost every day since I received it. I
have only to desire <PB N="116" REF="131"/> that you would not think me
<HI>stupid</HI>; and then you must of course conclude me highly
delighted, to find the verses which had so greatly pleased me, made so
<HI>particularly interesting</HI> to me. In tes∣timony hereof, I have
caused these my letters to be made <HI>patent,</HI> &amp;c. Furthermore, I
am glad to see you dissent from some alterations I proposed, for
which, generally speaking, I think I can see your reasons. As to any
little matter which I have to mention farther, I chuse to defer it till I
wait on Mr. Hardy; which I purpose to do before this month is out. It may
possibly <HI>happen</HI> the beginning of the next week; but I dare not lay
such stress upon a future <HI>event,</HI> as to give you a commission
to say so much to <HI>him.</HI> Instead thereof please to make him my
compliments, and tell him I talk of coming <HI>very soon.</HI></P>
<P>I borrowed Dodsley's Miscellany of Lady Lux∣borough, in which
are many good things. I long to be making a mark on the head of every copy (as
I would do were the books my <HI>own</HI>). Here a cypher; there an
asterism of five points, and there one of eight.—If you, and Mr.
W—, and Mr. G—, and I, were together for a fort∣night, to correct
and revise, might not we make a miscellany of <HI>originals</HI> that would
sell?—My fingers itch to be at it;—but I fear it cannot
be.—Thomson's poem amused me greatly.—I think his plan has
faults; particularly, that he should have said nothing of the diseases
attending lazi∣ness in his <HI>first</HI> canto, but reserved them to
strike us <HI>more affectingly</HI> in the last; but, on the whole, who
would have thought that Thomson could have so well imitated a person
remarkable for simplicity both of sentiment and phrase?</P>
<P>I study no connections in a letter; and so I pro∣ceed to tell
you, that I have got a machine to exhibit landscapes, &amp;c. to advantage.
It costs about fourteen shillings, and I recommend one to you or Mr.
Hardy.—Smith's Views (with a <PB N="117" REF="132"/> little colouring)
appear ravishingly;—but if you are not content with
<HI>amusement,</HI> and want <HI>fame</HI> (which differs about as much as
<HI>fox</HI>-hunting from <HI>hare</HI>-hunting), you must
<HI>print.</HI>—However, if you can acquiesce in a <HI>limited

a silver clasp, which you <HI>may</HI> have gild∣ed; but be sure it be

<HEAD>LV. To a Friend, disappointing him of a Visit.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>June, 1749.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>FIE on Mr. N—! he has disappointed me of the most
seasonable visit that heart could wish or desire.—My flowers in
blossom, my walks newly cleaned, my neighbours invited, and I languishing
for lack of your company! Mean time you are going to dance attendance on a
courtier.—Would to God! he may disappoint <HI>you,</HI> according to
the usual practice of those gentlemen;—I mean, by giving you a far
better living than you ever expected.</P>
<P>I have no sooner <HI>made</HI> that I am ready to <HI>re∣cal</HI>
that wish, in order to substitute another in its place; which is, that
you may rather squat yourself down upon a fat goose living in
War∣wickshire, or one in Staffordshire, or perhaps Worcestershire, of
the <HI>same denomination.</HI> I do not mention Shropshire, because I
think I am more remote from the main body of that county than I am from either
of the others. But, never∣theless, by all means wait on Mr. N—; shew
him all respect, yet so as not to lay out any of the profits of your
<HI>contingent</HI> living in a black vel∣vet waistcoat and breeches to
appear before him. True merit needeth nought of this. Be∣sides, peradventure,
you may not receive the first quarter's income of it this half year. He will
probably do something for you one time or other; but you shall never go
into Ireland, that is certain, for less than a deanry; not for less than
the deanry of St. Patrick's, if you take my advice. Lower your hopes only to
advance your surprise; 
<Q REND="inline">"<HI>grata</HI> supervenient quae non
sperabimus."</Q> Come to me <HI>as you may.</HI> A week is elapsed since
you <HI>began</HI> to be detained; you may surely come over in a fortnight

home.—However, write directly; you know our letters are long upon their
journey.—I expected you the be∣ginning of every week, till I received
your last letter <HI>impatiently.</HI></P>
<P>For my part, I began to wean myself from all hopes and
expectations whatever.—I feed my wild-ducks, and I water my carnations!
Happy enough, if I could extinguish my ambi∣tion <HI>quite,</HI> or
<HI>indulge</HI> (what I hope I feel in an equal degree) the desire of being
something more beneficial in my sphere.—Perhaps some few other
circumstances would want also to be adjusted.</P>
<P>I have just read Lord Bolingbroke's three let∣ters, which I like
as much as most pieces of po∣litics I ever read. I admire, especially, the
spi∣rit of the style. I as much admire <HI>at</HI> the edi∣tor's unpopular
preface.—I know the family hi∣therto <HI>seemed</HI> to make it a point
to conceal Pope's affair; and now, the editor, under Lord B's in∣spection,
not only relates, but invites people to think the worst of it.—What
<HI>collateral</HI> reasons my Lord may have for thinking ill of Mr. Pope, I
cannot say; but surely it is not <HI>political</HI> to lessen a
person's character that had done one so much honour.</P>

<P>I have this moment received a long letter from Lady Luxborough;

him.—Have you read my Lord Boling∣broke's Essays on Patriotism,

state and vanity than a Turk in his seraglio.—I have <HI>some</HI>
hopes of seeing you <HI>this</HI> week; but if these should happen to be
frustrated, I shall find them revive with double ardour and vivacity the
next. Did you tell me of a treatise that your <PB N="123" REF="138"/> Mr.
Millar had, where the author endeavours to vindicate and establish Gothic
architecture? and does not the same man explain it also by draughts on
copper plates? That very book, or rather the title, and the author's name, I
want.—I shall never, I believe, be entirely partial to Goths or Vandals
either; but I think, by the assistance of some such treatise, I
could sketch out some charming Gothic temples and Gothic benches for garden
seats.—I do also esteem it extremely ridiculous to permit another
person to design <HI>for</HI> you, when by sketching out your own plans
you <HI>appropriate</HI> the merit of all you build, and feel a double
pleasure from any praises which it receives.—I had here last
Wednesday Dean Lyttelton, Mr. William Lyttelton, Com¦modore West, Miss
Lyttelton and Miss West. They drank tea, and went round my walks, where
they seemed astonished they had been so long ignorant of the beauties
of the place; said, in general, every thing that was <HI>complaisant</HI>

and with room to hope for many more. Mean time, why do not <HI>you</HI> come? I
<HI>do</HI> say you are not Pylades.—What! you think, be∣cause you
have an agreeable wife, and five fine children, that you must employ all your
time in caressing them at home, or laying schemes for their emolument
abroad? Is this public spirit? is this virtue? or, if it be virtue, dost
thou think, because thou art <HI>vartuous,</HI> there must be no cakes and

being <PB N="125" REF="142"/> assured, as he says, that Mr. Wren's
behaviour must afford a good subject for drollery. I do not know how far
this would be proper; but I think, when I write again to my friend Wren, to
give him a sketch of his own character, just as it appeared to us during
the time of our vi∣sit. Perhaps it may avail a little. Amidst his violent
passion for gardening, if he would but prune away some wild
excrescences from one or two branches of his character, he might bring
himself to bear good fruit. He should <HI>weed</HI> his <HI>mind</HI> a
little; where there has sprung up a most luxuriant crop of puns, that
threaten to choak all its wholesome productions. 
<Q REND="inline">"Spinas animo fortius quam agro evellat."</Q> He has
good sense and good-nature; pity he should disguise them.—Not
but that it is better to have the <HI>substance</HI> alone than the
<HI>forms alone,</HI> and so I con∣clude. Since I came home, I have done
little else than plant bushes, hazel hawthorn, crabtree, elder, &amp;c.
together with some flowering shrubs that I have had given me, and some
that I have purchased to the amount of twenty shillings. I think nothing
remarkable has occurred; only, one miserable tempestuous day, I had my Lord
Stamford, who called to see my walks. My Lord promised to come again in the
summer, and invited me more than once to Enville. By the way, he is now
building a Gothic green∣house by Mr. Miller's direction, and intends to build
castles, and God-knows-what. By all ac∣counts, the place is well worth
seeing when you come in to the country, which I hope you will not fail to do
this spring. Pray do not you embroil me with Mr. Miller, in regard to
<HI>any</HI> observa∣tions I made in his walks. Remember there were a great
many things with which I was highly delighted; and forget that there were a few
also which I seemed less to admire. Indeed, I thought it idle to regulate
my expressions, amongst friends only, by the same rules which 
<PB N="126" REF="143"/> I ought to observe in mixed company. I say
<HI>ought,</HI> for <HI>he</HI> has been exceedingly favourable to <HI>me</HI>
in his representation of the Leasows.—I hope to see Mr. Fancourt
with you, when you come this spring; and why not your brother? he can spend
half a week every now and then at Wroxal.</P>
<P>I have nothing to <HI>insert</HI> or <HI>inclose</HI> in this
letter that can render it at all agreeable.—I cannot <HI>write,</HI> I
cannot <HI>think.</HI> I can just muster up atten∣tion enough to give
orders to my workmen; I saunter about my grounds, take snuff, and read
Clarissa. This last part of my employment threatens to grow extremely
<HI>tedious:</HI> not but the author is a man of <HI>genius</HI> and <HI>nice
observation</HI>; but he might be less <HI>prolix.</HI> I will send you 
<Q REND="inline">"The Life of Socrates"</Q> when I can get it home
from Barrels. I wish both your circumstances and mine would allow of an
utter <HI>inattention</HI> to them; and then, I believe, our natural indo∣lence
would be a kind of match for our ambi∣tion. I shall probably enlarge my
acquaintance this year; but what <HI>doth</HI> it? the circle of my friends
with whom I can be <HI>easy,</HI> and <HI>amused</HI> much, will continue
small as ever. I could dwell a good deal upon this subject; but I have only
room to desire you would give me your opinion how I should inscribe my
urn to Mr. Somerville. 
<Q REND="inline">"Author of the Chace"</Q> cannot be tolerably
expressed in Latin without a circumlo∣cution. I aim at brevity, and would
therefore omit it. Pray read over the specimens I have thrown together, and
<HI>oblige</HI> me with a speedy an∣swer, if it extend to nothing else

<SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I ACKNOWLEDGE myself obliged to you for procuring me the pictures.
I received them both very safe, as I have a pretty strong assurance I
<HI>shall</HI> do most articles of which my servant Tom has the
care.—He has punctuality and management to <HI>alone</HI> for his
<HI>imperfections.</HI> He brought me these paper-sculled busts from
Wroxall entirely unhurt, contrary to the expec∣tation of all that saw them;
after which, he might undertake for almost any thing.—The por∣trait is
undoubtedly a good one. I shewed it to Mr. Smart (who is a painter himself,
though a clergyman), and he allowed as much; added also, that it had
something of Sir Godfrey Knel∣ler, as well as of Sir Peter Lely.—The
flower-piece is very good, so far as relates to the flow∣ers; the dog and
parrot abominable, and the grapes very exceptionable. I never consider the
two flower-pieces at Icheneton with attention enough to cause a preference;
having never any thoughts that <HI>either</HI> would fall to my share. I
shall add nothing with regard to your choice; but that I sincerely
<HI>hope</HI> yours is the better piece. I never heard of Casteels, I own;
nor can I find his name in any of my accounts of the painters, though they take
in pretty modern ones: but I can say this for your comfort, that if he
excelled in any thing, it was probably in flowers; for I see his name at the
bottom of those flower-pieces that I have in water colours, as the designer
of them; and I think the designs are good. Though I could wish neither the
Cupid nor the fruit-piece had escaped us, yet is there no blame to be laid at
your door; at least supposing <PB N="128" REF="145"/> that you are endowed
with nothing more than rational conjecture, and that you are not gifted with
prophecy.</P>
<P>And now, having spoken, I think, to <HI>most</HI> parts of your
letter, I proceed to say a word or two in the way of appendix. First then,
after five or six weeks work of masons and carpenters, I plainly discover
that my house is an unfinishable thing;—and yet, I persuade
myself, there will never be wanting a room in it, where you may spend an
agreeable day with your undoubted friend.—Did I ever tell you how
<HI>unseasonably</HI> the three fiddles struck up in my grove about an
hour after you left me; and how a set of ten bells was heard from my wood the
evening after? It might have passed for the harmony of some aerial
spirit, who was a well-wisher to us poor mortals; but that I think, had it
been so, it would have been addressed to the <HI>better sort,</HI> and
of consequence have been heard whilst <HI>you</HI> were <HI>here.</HI> This
by way of introduction to what I am going to tell you. Mr. Pixell has made an
agree∣ment with his club at Birmingham, to give me a day's music in some
part of my walks. The time is not yet fixed: but, if you were an idle man, and
could be brought over at a day or two's notice, I would give it you, and be in
hopes I could entertain you very agreeably.</P>
<P>You cannot think how much you gratified my vanity when you were
here, by saying that if this place were yours, you thought you should be
less able to keep within the bounds of <HI>aeconomy</HI> than
myself.—God knows, it is pain and grief to me to observe her rules at
<HI>all;</HI> and <HI>rigidly</HI> I never can.—How is it possible to
possess improveable scenes, and not wish to improve them? and how is
it possible, with oeconomy, to be at the ex∣pence of improving them upon my
fortune? To be continually in fear of excess in perfecting every trifling
design, how irksome! to be res∣trained <PB N="126" REF="146"/> from
attempting <HI>any,</HI> how vexatious! so that I never can enjoy my
situation—that is certain.—Oeconomy, that invidious old matron!
on occasion of ever frivolous expence, makes such a hellish squalling,
that the murmur of a cascade is utterly lost to me.—Often do I cry
out with Cowley, 
<Q> 
<L>O rivers! brooks! when, when in <HI>you,</HI> shall I</L> 
<L>Myself, eas'd of <HI>un-peaceful</HI> thought, espy!</L>

<SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>PRAY, is laziness an excuse for not writing? Tell
me.—However, if it be so, I am afraid I shall want an excuse for
laziness, like the philosopher, who, supposing the world might rest
upon a tortoise's back, found himself no less embarrassed for a
pedestal to support his tortoise. I have indeed been pretty busy at
home, in raising a pool-dam, and have interchanged a few visits with such
of my acquaintance as live within three miles.—What then?—I
abominate all excuses that are grounded upon the business 
<PB N="130" REF="147"/> or amusements of an idle man.—As if such a
person's time was so wholly filled up, that he could not find half an hour
to write a line to his friend. It is best to acknowledge laziness at
first, and that there are particular intervals, when one is much less
disposed to write even a sew lines, than at others. And then, as to
laziness, one has nothing to do but to plead human frail∣ty; which, if a
person has not too many frailties besides, may perhaps be indulged him.
How∣ever, 
<Q REND="inline">"Veniam petimusque, damusque,"</Q> will not fail
to weigh with every good-natured man. The chief dealing I have with Harris the
Jew is, for the intelligence which he brings me con∣cerning you and Mrs.
W—; but it seldom amounts to much more than that you are well, and in
your garden.</P>
<P>He is an Ebrew Jew, or he would tell me you had purchased a couple
of genteel horses, or a chaise and pair, and were coming over to The
Leasows to spend a week with me.</P>
<P>Nevertheless, I hope to see you soon; but <HI>en
passant</HI> I assure you, I shall go in about a month to Mr. Jago's,
and from thence to Mr. Miller's; who, I believe I told you, was here, with Mr.
Lyttelton, Lady Aylesbury, Colonel Conway, &amp;c. I think I never answered
your query con∣cerning Colonel Lyttelton.—He is the same per∣son that
you remember, and your prophecy con∣cerning him has been literally
accomplished. He is a man of courage, genius, generosity, and
po∣liteness; has been fortunate in the world; was made a Colonel at about
six and twenty; dis∣tinguished himself in several campaigns; mar∣ried
the Dutchess of Bridgewater; and had the other day about sixteen thousand
pounds lest him by Colonel Jefferies, a very distant relation. He has a
seat, and speaks in the House of Commons, has bought a town and
country-house; the latter of which he is ornamenting in the modern way. 
<PB N="131" REF="148"/> His Dutchess the most unceremonious even-tempered
woman that lives.—So enjoy the spirit of prophecy, and exert it
again.—It needs little more than good sense.—Which of the
histori∣ans is it, that foretold in his history a very re∣markable series
of events, by dint of this alone, and which were all accomplished? Let me
know what you are doing now. Have you repaired the farm-house you talked
of?—and have you remembered to make the man a couple of good large niches
in his chimney corner, where he, and his family, may spend a more comfortable
evening than was ever spent by any first minister in
Christendom;—perhaps also converse more to the purpose. You tell
me nothing of your Mr. Jago, Seignior Benedict, the new married man. Tell him
to leave his wife and family for a day or two, saddle his mule, and come to
The Leasows.—Tell him, all pleasures are heighten∣ed by a little
discontinuance.—Tell him, did I say? how can you for shame advise
him so con∣trarily to your own practice?</P>

one's passions to one's way of life; and the solitary, unsocial
sphere in which I move makes me think it happy that I can retain a relish
for such trifles as I can draw into it. Mean time, I dare not reason too
much <PB N="133" REF="150"/> upon this head. Reason, like the famous con∣cave
mirrour at Paris, would in two minutes, vitrify all the Jew's pack: I mean,
that it would immediately destroy all the form, colour, and beauty, of every
thing that is not merely useful.—But I ramble too far, and you do not

<SALUTE>Dear Mr. —,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WITH the utmost gratitude for the obser∣vations which you sent
me, and with the highest opinion of their propriety in gene∣ral, do I sit
down to answer your obliging let∣ter. You will not take it amiss, I know,
if I scrible broken hints, and trace out little sketches of my mind, just
as I should go near to explain it if I were upon the spot, as often as I
think of you, which I beg leave to assure you happens many times in a day.
They say, 
<Q REND="inline">"A word to the wise is enough;"</Q> a word,
therefore, to a friend of understanding may be supposed to be something
more than enough, because it is pro∣bable he is acquainted with three parts
of one's mind before.—The censure you have passed upon Milton's
Lycidas, so far as it regards the metre which he has chosen, is
unexceptionably just; and one would imagine, if that argument con∣cerning the
distance of the rhimes were pressed home in a public essay, it should
be sufficient to extirpate that kind of verse for ever. As to my opinion
concerning the choice of English metre <PB N="134" REF="151"/> I dare not
touch upon the subject, and I will give you my reason: I began upon it in a
letter which I intended for you about a month ago; and I soon found that I
had filled a sheet of paper with my dissertation, and left no room for
other things which I had more mind to com∣municate. Beside, I sound it so
blotted that I did not chuse to send it; and as the subject is so
extremely copious, I shall decline it entirely, till <HI>talking</HI> may
prove as effectual as <HI>writing.</HI>—As to your advice, with regard to
my publications, I believe it to be just, and shall, in all probabili∣ty,
pursue it.—I am afraid, by your account, that Dodsley has published
my name to the School-mistress. I was a good deal displeased at his
publishing that poem without my know∣ledge, when he had so many
opportunities of giving me some previous information; but, as he would
probably disregard my resentment, I chose to stifle it, and wrote to
him directly upon the receipt of yours, that I would be glad to furnish him
with an improved copy of the School mistress, &amp;c. for his second
edition. He accepts it with some complaisance, desires it soon; and I
am at a fault to have the opinion of my friends, what alterations or additions
it will be proper to insert. I have scribled a copy, which I send this
day to Mr. Graves and Mr. Whistler; but I am greatly fearful I shall not
receive their criticisms time enough, and I shall have the same longing
for yours. A journey to Whitchurch, which I have long proposed, might unite
all these ad∣vantages; and I heartily wish I may be able to effect it
without inconvenience. If I go thither, I call on you.</P>

<P>WHAT a stupid fool was I, to shew you those letters of my
friend Graves, where∣in he declares himself so freely against a regular
correspondence! see the effects of it! You have taken immediate advantage
of his example, and I must never more expect an answer to any let∣ter that
I send you, in less than half a century. I wrote to you after I came home,
to thank you for all your kindness at I—, &amp;c. but not a syllable
have I been able to receive from you, or a word that I could hear concerning
you. I could, however, very easily convince you, that Mr. Graves (your
precedent) is not altogether so hardened an offender as you may imagine. His
last letter is a very affectionate recantation. I inclose that part of it
which regards Mr. F—.</P>
<P>What a number of schemes are irreparably broken by the sudden
death of the Prince of Wales! Yours, my good friend, which seems to be
destroyed amongst the rest, has, I think, of late given you no
solicitude. Your interest in Mr. N— will remain the same, I
suppose; and if he would but serve you nearer <HI>home,</HI> I will have
no sort of quarrel with him that he did not transplant you into
Cornwall.—It is at least some gratification to a person's self
love, when one finds the more <HI>ambitious</HI> hopes of more
<HI>aspir∣ing</HI> people as liable to be suddenly extinguished as one's
own. However, the death of the Prince gave me a good deal of concern, though it
no way affected my <HI>particular</HI> interest, as he had all the humane,
affable, and generous qualities, which could recommend him to one's
<HI>affection.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. Graves has sent me two copies of verses. One on Medals, to
Mr. Walker; and the other, <PB N="136" REF="153"/> on the late Memoirs of the
London Heroines, Lady V—, Mrs. Pilkington, and Mrs. Phillips. Both good
in their way, which you shall see when you come over.</P>

Cambridge?—The Verses written in a Country Church-yard?—Mr. W.
Whitehead's Ode to the Nymph of Bristol Spring?—or, what <HI>have</HI>
you seen?—You live infinitely more in the world than I do; who hear
nothing, see nothing, do nothing, and <HI>am</HI> nothing. Remedy this
unhappiness, by sending me somewhat that may rouse my
attention.—I must except what I hear from my Lady Luxbo∣rough, who
indulges me now and then with a letter in French.</P>
<P>If you should think this letter more than usually <HI>dull,</HI>
you must know, that, since I saw you, I have been <HI>generally</HI>
dispirited; till about a fortnight ago I found some nervous disorders
that I greatly disliked, and upon examination was told I had a nervous fever.
For this I have been taking saline draughts and bolus's, and <HI>hope</HI> I
am something better; though I am far from well. I would not indeed have
written to you at this time, but I chose not to defer send∣ing the

<SALUTE>Dear Mr. Graves,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>SINCE I received your letter, I have been a week at W—. I
believe I may have told you, that I never was fond of that place. There is too
much trivial elegance, too much punctilio for me; and perhaps, as you express
it, too much <HI>speculation.</HI> But I was fearful I might entirely lose
Mr. Whistler's acquaintance, if I did not make an effort once in five years
to return his visit. Besides, I should have had no hopes of seeing him
at The Leasows hereafter; and I am extremely desirous of seeing both
<HI>him</HI> and <HI>you</HI> here, having made many alterations which I do not
undertake but with an eye to the approbation of my more generous friends; but
he seems, to my great surprize, to renounce the thing called
<HI>taste</HI> in buildings, gardens, &amp;c. is grown weary of his own
little embellishments at W—, and longs to settle in London for the
greater part of his time. This, I believe, he would put in ex∣ecution
immediately; but that he thinks it might give some uneasiness to his
mother, if he should quit the house that she with so much dif∣ficulty 
<PB N="138" REF="155"/> obtained for him. <HI>I</HI> too am sick of the word
<HI>taste</HI>; but I think the <HI>thing</HI> itself the only proper
<HI>ambition,</HI> and the <HI>specific pleasure</HI> of all who have any
share in the faculty of imagination. I need not mention my reasons; you
will soon conceive them. And, however the case be, there is one branch of
it which so totally en∣grosses the persons with whom I principally
con∣verse, that I was astonished to hear him speak even with
indifference concerning the reigning taste for rural decorations. I could ill
forbear telling Mr. Whistler, that he was now <HI>literally</HI> a beau in a
band-box; but the freedom might have given more offence than the joke was
worth. He has improved the place extremely; but I do not like his colonnades.
You know, nothing of that kind is tolerable, unless regularly ex∣ecuted in
stone: that is one thing. Another is, that colonnades are ornaments which
will not <HI>bear</HI> to be very <HI>diminutive.</HI> Mr. — (whose
house only I saw) has been at the expence of a large cornice round it, in
most elaborate brick-work; but with regard to his stucco-work
<HI>within</HI> doors, he is quite <HI>extravagant.</HI>—I mention
these things upon a supposition that you may like to hear <HI>any</HI>
thing that regards the place; but indeed they are so mighty trifling, that I
ought to doubt my supposition. I supped with Mr. P—'s family once
at Mr. W—'s, and all was mighty well; only I happen to have a violent
aversion to card-playing, and at W— I think they do nothing
<HI>else.</HI> So that, on account of my ignorance at qua∣drille, or any
creditable game, I was forced to lose my money, and two evenings out of my
seven, at Pope Joan with Mr. P—'s children. Mr. W—, to make me
amends, invited me to breakfast, and shewed me your verses. I assure
you, you have no occasion for a better advocate than Mr. W—; whether
with regard to his <HI>judgement,</HI> or his zeal in behalf of the subject, 
<PB N="139" REF="156"/> the verses or the poet. I would fain have obtained a
copy; but he did not care to give one without your commission. I hope
<HI>you</HI> will oblige me so far. I like them very much; the subject is
genteel, and the verses easy and elegant. We agreed upon one or two
dif∣ferent readings; and one stanza that concerns cards should, I think, be
corrected. Not that I would have you less severe upon cards nei∣ther; I was
even glad to find, that you g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ve
them so little quarter. I sometimes thought that Mr. W—'s seeming
fondness for them was a kind of <HI>contre-caeur.</HI>—Be that as it
will, his ob∣jection to the stanza, as well as mine, was solely founded on
the versification, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the
sentiment. I liked his Latin verses; but they do not inter∣fere with
your's. Send me a copy, and confine my use of it by what limitations you
please. My reigning toy at present is a pocket-book; and I glory as much in
furnishing it with the verses of my acquaintance, as others would with
bank-bills. I did not know when I went to W—, but I might have heard Mrs.
G— <HI>accused of certain questions touching their law</HI> (I mean
of forms and ceremonies); but I did <HI>not.</HI> On the contrary, I had the
satisfaction of hearing her person, her temper, and her understanding,
much commended; but this I did not want. The delicacy of your taste, is equal
with me to a thousand commendations. Mrs. W— is really so much
altered by her indisposition, that I did not know her. She talks of going
to Bath this season.—I talked of it too, and wish it of all earthly
things. You must know, I could not have come to Claverton <HI>instead</HI>
of going to W—, as I did not determine on the expedition at home; but at
a friend's house, where I was betwixt twenty and thirty miles on my way
thither. Besides, I would allow myself more time when I turn my face
towards Bath, than I could this <PB N="140" REF="157"/> winter. Your invitation,
as it is very obliging, so it has many concurring circumstances to

recovered by Bath, or <HI>nothing</HI> I want to have you read some trifles

endeavours to sup∣port my spirits. Your company would do it ef∣fectually,
but scarce any thing less, in <HI>winter.</HI> Solitary life, limited
circumstances, a phlegma∣tic habit, and disagreeable events, have given me
a melancholy turn, that is hardly dissipated by the most serene sky;
but in a north-east wind, is quite intolerable. After a long state of this

<HI>right</HI> to be happy; that it is one of Wollaston's implicit lies; a
treating things contrary to what they <HI>deserve.</HI>—Your
situ∣ation at Claverton is admired by most people; and, if you could

<SALUTE>Dear Mr. G—,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM very sensibly obliged to you for the <HI>diligence</HI> and
<HI>expedition</HI> which you have shewn in answering my late request: I
cannot feel the very <HI>tenderness</HI> of friendship to be at all abated
in me by our long separation; nor will it at any time be possible I
should, so long as I receive such testimonies of your usual
<HI>kindness</HI> and <HI>ingenu∣ity.</HI> <PB N="142" REF="159"/>—I
have no sort of exceptions to make against the province in which you were
engaged at Cheltenham, nor the light in which you ap∣peared. What you lost in
any ones opinion of your independency, you would gain in their idea of your
merit, genius and learning; and then you had all those advantages <HI>par
dessu.</HI>—As to the compliments that were paid to Mrs. G—,
you have something of the same sort of reason to be pleased with
them, that I have to be pleased with those that are given to my place;
which I consider as naturally possessed of many beauties, each of
them brought to light, and perfected through my own discernment, care and
cultiva∣tion. And then, your pleasure ought to be so much greater than
mine, as you have a nobler subject to enjoy.—Mrs. G— has too much
sense to object against the freedom of this similitude.</P>
<P>I cannot help adding a few strokes to your picture of Mrs.
—. I think her an extreme∣ly <HI>superficial</HI> female-pedant; for
after an inter∣val of many years since I first conversed with her at Mr.
—'s I found her conversation turn solely upon the same <HI>topics,
definitions</HI> and <HI>quota∣tions.</HI> I believe, I could easily enough
have re∣commended myself to a greater degree of her favour; but her vanity
and affectations are be∣yond what I could bear. Your account of — is very
picturesque, and agreeable to the idea I always had of him; but I believe
that idea was perfected by wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>
observations I made when I had some of his company at London. There was
something accountable enough to me in their burlesquing Mr. L—'s
monody. He is, you know, engaged in a party, and his poem (though an
extraordinary fine composition) was too tender for the public ear. It
should have been printed privately, and a number of copies dispersed only
among their friends and acquain∣tances;—but even so, it would have been
re∣published; <PB N="143" REF="160"/> and it was too good to suppress. I
wish the burlesquers of such <HI>ingenuous</HI> profu∣sions could be
punished, consistently with English liberty.

<P>I heard, once before, it was burlesqued under the title of

a neighbour told me, I was put in the commission of the peace. I have never
receiv∣ed a single line from Mr. Whistler, and I be∣lieve my journey to
W— has given the final blow to our friendship. Pray was not Mr. Blandy
some relation of theirs, or only their at∣torney? The affair is uncommonly
shocking; and I fancy the <HI>genuine</HI> accounts that Mr. W— sends
you, will be curious anecdotes at Bath—I suppose you have painted
your room with oil colours, and made it <HI>really</HI> handsome.—I
drew out a festoon and a medal some time ago, for a pan∣nel over Mr.
P—'s chimney; but they knew not what to make of the medal, and had only
the festoon executed in stone colour, by a com∣mon painter;—yours is
better, and in character.—I am a degree more frugal than you; for I only
use quick lime, and either blue or yellow

<P><PB N="144" REF="161"/>I paid a visit to Mr. Lyttelton, the Dean,

Brother.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>The Leasows, 
<DATE>Feb. 14, 1752.</DATE></DATELINE> 
<SALUTE>Dear Mr. Graves,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU will be amazed at my long silence; and it might reasonably
excite some disgust if my days had passed of late in the manner they
used to do: but I am not the man I was; per∣haps I never <HI>shall</HI> be.
Alas! my dearest friend! I have lost my only brother! and, since the
fatal close of November, I have had neither peace nor respite from
agonizing thoughts!</P>
<P>You, I think, have <HI>seen</HI> my brother; but per∣haps had no
opportunity of distinguishing him from the groupe of others, whom we call
<HI>good-natured</HI> men. This part of his character was so visible in his
countenance, that he was generally beloved at sight; <HI>I,</HI> who must
be allowed to know him, do assure you, that his understanding was no way
inferior to his benevolence. He had not only a sound judgement, but a lively
wit and genuine humour. As these were many times eclipsed by his native
bashfulness, so his benevolence only suffered by being shewn to an
excess. I here mean his giving too indiscrimi∣nately into those jovial
meetings of company, where the warmth of a social temper is discover∣ed
with less reserve; but the virtues of his head and heart would soon have
shone without alloy. The foibles of his youth were wearing off; and his
affection for me and regard to my advice, with his own good sense, would
soon have rendered him all that I could have wished in a successor. I
never in my life knew a person more sincere in the expression of love
or dislike. <PB N="146" REF="163"/> But it was the <HI>former</HI> that
suited the propensity of his heart; the <HI>latter</HI> was as transient
as the starts of passion that occasioned it. In short, with much true
genius and real fortitude, he was, ac∣cording to the <HI>English</HI>
acceptation, 
<Q REND="inline">"a true honest man;"</Q> and I think I may also
add, a truly English character; but 
<Q REND="inline">"habeo, dixi? immo <HI>habui</HI> fratrem &amp;
amicum, Chreme!"</Q> All this have I <HI>lost</HI> in him. He is now in
re∣gard to <HI>this</HI> world no more than a mere idea. And this idea,
therefore, though deeply tinged with melancholy, I must, and surely
<HI>ought</HI> to, cherish and preserve.</P>
<P>I believe I wrote you some account of his ill∣ness last
spring; from which, to all appearance, he was tolerably well recovered. He
took the air, and visited about with me, during the war∣mer months of
summer; but my pleasure was of short duration. 
<Q REND="inline">"Haesit lateri lethalis arundo!"</Q> The
peripneumony under which he laboured in the spring had terminated in an
adhesion of the lungs to the pleura, so that he could never lie but on his
right side; and this, as the weather grew colder, occasioned an
obstruction that could never be surmounted.</P>
<P>Though my reason forewarned me of the event, I was not the more
prepared for it.—Let me not dwell upon it—.It is altogether
insuppor∣table in <HI>every respect</HI>: and my imagination seems more
assiduous in educing pain from this occa∣sion, than I ever yet found it
in administering to my pleasure.—This hurts me to no
purpose.—I know it; and yet, when I have avocated my thoughts, and
fixed them for a while upon com∣mon amusements, I suffer the same sort
of con∣sciousness as if I were guilty of a crime. Believe me, this has
been the most sensible affliction I ever felt in my life; and you, who
know my anxiety when I had far less reason to complain, will more easily
<HI>conceive</HI> it now, than I am able to describe it.</P>
<P><PB N="147" REF="164"/>I cannot pretend to fill up my paper with my
usual subjects.—I should thank you for your re∣marks upon my
poetry; but I despise poetry: and I might tell you of all my little rural
im∣provements; but I hate them.—What can I now expect from my solitary
rambles through them, but a series of melancholy reflections and irk∣some
anticipations?—Even the pleasure I should take in in shewing them
to <HI>you,</HI> the greatest they can afford me, must be now greatly
inferior to what it might formerly have been.</P>
<P>How have I prostituted my sorrow on occa∣sions that little
concerned me! I am ashamed to think of that idle 
<Q REND="inline">"Elegy upon Autumn."</Q> when I have so much more
important cause to hate and to condemn it <HI>now</HI>; but the glare and
gaiety of the Spring is what I <HI>principally</HI> dread; when I shall find
all things restored but my poor bro∣ther, and something like those lines
of Milton will run for ever in my thoughts: 
<Q> 
<L>Thus, with the year,</L> 
<L><HI>Seasons</HI> return; but not to <HI>me</HI> returns</L> 
<L>A brother's cordial smile, at eve or morn.</L></Q> I shall
then seem to wake from amusements, company; every <HI>sort</HI> of
inebriation with which I have been endeavouring to lull my grief asleep, as
from a dream; and I shall feel as if I were, <HI>that instant,</HI>
despoiled of all I have chiefly valu∣ed for thirty years together; of all my
present happiness, and all my future prospects. The melody of birds,
which he no more must hear; the chearful beams of the sun, of which he no
more must partake; <HI>every</HI> wonted pleasure will produce that
<HI>sort</HI> of pain to which my temper is most obnoxious. Do not
consider this as poetry.—Poetry on such occasions is no more than
literal truth. In the present case it is <HI>less</HI>; for half the
tenderness I feel is altogether shapeless and inexpressible.</P>
<P><PB N="148" REF="165"/>After all, the wisdom of the world may
per∣haps esteem me a gainer. Ill do they judge of this event, who think that
any shadow of amends can be made for the death of a brother, and the
disappointment of all my schemes, by the accession of some fortune,
which I never can enjoy!</P>
<P>This is a mournful narrative: I will not, therefore, enlarge
it.—Amongst all changes and chances, I often think of you; and pray
there may be no suspicion or jealousy betwixt us dur∣ing the rest of
our lives.</P>

<P>ALAS! dear Mr. W—! the terrible event has happened! I have
lost the best of brothers; and you are to pity, not to condemn, your
unfortunate correspondent.</P>
<P>About the middle of November I had pre∣pared a letter for you, which
lies now amongst my papers. At that time, amidst all my appre∣hensions, I
had some hopes to support me; but before I could send it, my situation
was greatly altered, and the month did not wholly expire, till it had
effectually rendered me the most wretched of mankind.</P>
<P>Thus much it was necessary I should tell you; you will pardon
me, if I do not descend any farther into an account of merit that is lost,
and of sorrow which is too apt to revive of itself. Be assured, it is
to me a loss which the whole <PB N="149" REF="166"/> world cannot
compensate; and an affliction which the longest time I can live will not be
able to erase.</P>
<P>You said, you would let Master W— come and spend a few
days with me.—I beseech you do.—It will be some relief to me;
and, God knows, I have occasion enough for every assist∣ance than can
be drawn from correspondence, company, or amusement.</P>
<P>You, Sir, I presume, proceed in the innocent recreations of your
garden, and those may at least prove a balance for any small disquiets
that attend you. If greater ills befal you, you have persons near you to
alleviate them. A wife, family, visitants, male and female friends in
abundance, and a table sufficiently hospitable to attract even your
enemies. With me the case is otherwise. What I have undergone this win∣ter,
may you never feel so much as in apprehen∣sion!</P>

<SALUTE>Dear Mr. W—,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I DO not know why I made you a promise of a pretty long letter.
What I now write will be but a moderate one, both in regard to length and
stile; yet write I must, <HI>par maniere d'acquit,</HI> and you have
brought four-pence expence upon yourself for a parcel of nonsense, and to
no manner of purpose. This is not tautology, you <PB N="150" REF="167"/>
must observe; for nonsense sometimes answers very considerable
purposes.—In love, it is elo∣quence itself.—In friendship,
therefore, by all the rules of sound logic, you must allow it to be
something; what I cannot say, 
<Q REND="inline">"nequeo mons∣trare, &amp; sentio tantum."</Q>
The principal part of a correspondence betwixt two idle men con∣sists in
two important enquiries—what we do, and how we do; but as all persons
ought to give satisfaction before they expect to receive it, I am to tell you
in the first place, that my own health is tolerably good, or rather what I
must call good, being, I think, much better than it has been this last half
year.—Then as touching my occupation, alas! 
<Q REND="inline">"Othello's occupation's gone!"</Q> I neither read
nor write aught besides a few letters; and I give myself up entirely to
scenes of dissipation; lounge at my Lord Dud∣ley's for near a week
together; make dinners; accept of invitations; sit up till three o'clock in
the morning with young sprightly married wo∣men, over white port and <HI>vin
de paysans;</HI> ramble over my fields; issue out orders to my
hay-ma∣kers; foretel rain and fair weather; enjoy the fragance of hay, the
cocks, and the wind rows; admire that universal lawn, which is produced by
the scythe; sometimes inspect, and draw mouldings for my carpenters;
sometimes paper my walls, and at other times my cielings; do every social
office that falls in my way, but never seek out for any.</P>

all.</P>
<P>Tell my young pupil, your son, he must by all manner of means
send me a Latin letter: and if he have any billet in French, for Miss Lea
at The Grange, or even in Hebrew, Coptic, or <PB N="151" REF="168"/> Syriac, I
will engage it shall be received very graciously. Thither am I going to
dinner this day, and there,

<OPENER><DATELINE>The Leasows, 
<DATE>Oct. 3, 1752.</DATE></DATELINE> 
<SALUTE>Dear Mr. G—,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM very unfeignedly ashamed to reflect how long it is since I
received your present, and how much longer it is since I received your
letter. I have been resolving to write to you almost daily ever since you
left me; yet have foolishly enough permitted avocations (of infi∣nitely
less importance than your correspon∣dence) to interfere with my gratitude,
my in∣terest, and my inclination. What apology I have to make, though no way
adequate to my negligence, is in short as follows. After the receipt of your
letter, I deferred writing till I could speak of the arrival of your
picture.—This did not happen till about a month or five weeks ago, when I
was embarrassed with masons, carvers, carpenters, and company, all at a
time. And though it were idle enough to say, that I <PB N="152" REF="169"/>
could not find <HI>one</HI> vacant hour for my purpose, yet in truth my head
was so confused by these multifarious distractions, that I could have
writ∣ten nothing satisfactory either to <HI>myself</HI> or <HI>you:</HI>
nothing worth a single <HI>penny,</HI> supposing the postage were to
cost you no more. The work∣men had not <HI>finished my rooms</HI> a minute,
when Lady Luxborough, Mrs. Davies, and Mr. Out∣ing arrived, with <HI>five</HI>
servants and a <HI>set</HI> of horses, to stay with me for some time.
After a nine days' visit, I returned with them to Barrels, where I continued
for a week; and whither (by the way) I go again with Lord Dudley in about a
fortnight's time. Other company filled up the interstices of my summer; and
I hope my dear friend will accept of this apology for so long a chasm of
silence, during which I have been uniformly at his service, and true to
that inviolable friendship I shall ever bear him.</P>
<P>I proceed now to thank you for the <HI>distinction,</HI> you
shew me, in sending me your picture: I do it very sincerely, It is
assuredly a strong like∣ness, as my Lady Luxborough with all her
ser∣vants that have <HI>seen you</HI> pronounce, as well as I;
consequently more valuable to a <HI>friend</HI> than a face he does not know,
though it were one of Raphael's: The smile about the mouth is bad, as it
agrees but ill with the gravity of the eyes; and as a smile, ever so little
<HI>outre</HI> has a bad effect in a picture where it is <HI>constant,</HI>
though it may be ever so graceful in a person where it is
<HI>transitory.</HI> However, this may be altered, when I can meet with a
good painter. I have no <HI>other</HI> objection, but to the prominence of the
belly. The hair, I think, is good; and the coat and band no way exceptionable.
I have given it all the advantage I can: it has a good light, and makes part of
an elegant chimney-piece in a genteel, though little breakfast-room, at the
end of my house.</P>
<P><PB N="153" REF="170"/>Mr. Whistler and I are now upon good terms,
and two or three friendly letters have been in∣terchanged betwixt us. He
presses me to come to Whitchurch; and I <HI>him</HI> to come over to The
Leasows; but the winter cometh, when no man can visit.—The dispute
is adjusted by <HI>time,</HI> whilst we are urging it by
<HI>expostulation.</HI>—No uncommon event in most sublunary
projects!</P>
<P>Lady Luxborough said very extraordinary things in praise of Mrs.
G—, after you left us at Barrels; yet I sincerely believe no more than
she deserves. I took the liberty of shewing her your letter here, as it
included a compliment to her, which I thought particularly genteel.—She
will always consider you as a person of genius, and her friend.</P>
<P>During most of this summer (wherein I have seen much company
either here or at Lord Dudley's) I have been almost constantly en∣gaged in
one continued scene of <HI>jollity.</HI> I en∣deavoured to find
<HI>relief</HI> from such sort of dissipa∣tion; and, when I had once
given in to it, I was obliged to proceed; as, they say, is the case when
persons disguise their face with paint.—<HI>Mine</HI> was a sort
of <HI>painting</HI> applied to my tem∣per. 
<Q REND="inline">"Spem vultu simulare, premere atrum corde

haggard and for∣lorn. My company has now deserted me; the spleen-fogs begin
to rise; and the <HI>terrible</HI> inci∣dents of last winter revive apace
in my memory. This is my state of mind, while I write you these few lines;
yet, I thank God, my health is not much amiss.</P>
<P>I did not forget my promise of a box, &amp;c. to Mr. G—. I
had a dozen sent me, one or two of which I could have liked, had they been
better <HI>finished.</HI> They were of a good oval, white enamel, with
flowers, &amp;c. but horribly gilt, and not accurately painted. I beg my best

<SALUTE>Dear Mr. Jago,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>COULD I with convenience mount my horse, and ride to Harbury this
instant, I should much more willingly do so than begin this letter. Such
terrible events have happened to us, since we saw each other last, that,
how∣ever irksome it may be to dwell upon them, it is, in the same degree,
unnatural to substitute any subject in their place.</P>
<P>I do sincerely forgive your long silence, my good friend, indeed
I do; though it gave me uneasiness. I hope you do the same by mine. I
own, I could not readily account for the <HI>former</HI> period of yours, any
otherwise than by supposing that I had said or done something, in the
levity of my heart, which had given you disgust; but being conscious to
myself of the most sincere regard for you, and believing it could never
be discredited for any <HI>trivial</HI> inad∣vertencies, I remember, I
continued still in ex∣pectation of a letter, and did not dream of writing
till such time as I had received one. I trusted you would write at
<HI>last</HI>; and that, by all my past endeavours to demonstrate my 
<PB N="155" REF="172"/> <HI>friendship,</HI> you would believe the
<HI>tree</HI> was rooted in my heart, whatever irregularity you might observe
in the <HI>branches.</HI></P>
<P>This was my situation before that dreadful aera which gave me
such a shock as to banish my best friends for a time out of my
memory.—And when they recurred, as they did the first of any thing, I
was made acquainted with that deplorable misfortune of yours! Believe me, I
sympathized in <HI>your</HI> affliction, notwithstanding my own; but, alas!
what comfort could I ad∣minister, who had need of every possible
assist∣ance to support myself? I wrote indeed a few letters with
<HI>difficulty</HI>; amongst the rest, one to my friend Graves; but it was
to vent my com∣plaint.—I will send you the letter, if you please, as
it is by far my least painful method of con∣veying you some account of my
situation. Let it convince you, that I could have written nothing at that
time, which could have been of any ser∣vice to you: let it afford you, at
least, a faint sketch of my dearest brother's character; but let it not
appear an ostentatious display of sorrow, of which I am by no means
guilty. I know but too well that I discovered upon the occasion, what
some would call, an unmanly tenderness; but I know also, that sorrow
upon such subjects as these is very consistent with virtue, and with

<HI>sentire</HI>; resistere tamen &amp; solatia admittere, non
solatiis non egere."</Q> Pliny.—I drank, pur∣chased amusements,
never suffered myself to be a minute without company, no matter what, so
it was but continual. At length, by an attention to such conversation and
such amusements as I could at other times despise, I forgot so far as
to be chearful.—And after this, the summer, through an almost
constant succession of lively and agree∣able visitants, proved even a
scene of jollity.—It <PB N="156" REF="173"/> was inebriation all, though
of a mingled nature; yet has it maintained a sort of truce with grief, till
time can assist me more effectually by throwing back the event to a
distance.—Now, indeed, that my company have all forsaken me, and I am
delivered up to winter, silence, and reflection, the incidents of the last
year revive apace in my memory; and I am even astonished to think of the
gaiety of my summer. The fatal anniversa∣ry, the 
<Q REND="inline">"dies quem semper acerbum, &amp;c."</Q> is
beginning to approach, and every face of the sky suggests the ideas of
last winter.—Yet I find myself chearful in <HI>company</HI>; nor
would I recom∣mend it to you to be much alone.—You would lay the
highest obligation upon me by coming over at this time.—I pressed
your brother, whom I saw at Birmingham, to use his influence with you; but
if you can by no means undertake the journey, I will take my speediest
opportunity of seeing you at Harbury.—Mr. Miller invited me
strenuously to meet Dr. Lyttelton at his house; but I believe my most
convenient season will be, when my Lord Dudley goes to Barrels; for I can
but ill bear the pensiveness of a long and lonely expedition. After all, if
you <HI>could</HI> come hither first, it would afford me the most entire
satisfaction.—I have been making alterations in my house that would
amuse you, and have many matters to discourse with you, which it would be
endless to mention upon paper.—Adieu, my dear friend! may your merit be
known to some one who has greater <HI>power</HI> to serve you than
myself; but be assured, at the same time, that no one loves you better,
or esteems you more.</P>

<SALUTE>Dear Mr. Jago,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ALTHOUGH I have many reasons to urge why I did not write to you
before, or visit you from Barrels as I fully intended, I will venture to wave
all particulars till I see you; and only assure you in the general, that
I was never able to write any thing satisfactory, or to visit you, at that
time, with any sort of con∣venience.</P>
<P>Believe me, my good friend, if <HI>inclination</HI> might have
ruled, I had been with you at Har∣bury many weeks ago. Sure I am, they must
be the <HI>cares</HI> of home, and not the <HI>pleasures</HI> of it, that
<HI>ever were</HI> sufficient to detain me during the <HI>winter
season.</HI> Nor do I think I have an enemy that wishes me more
miserable than I have, almost constantly, found myself ever since the
beginning of <HI>it.</HI></P>
<P>I cannot even now fix a time when I can see you; and perhaps it
may be deferred till Mr. Miller's place will have received some advan∣tage
from the Spring; and, in that case, I would infallibly see my Lord
Guildford's; but I leave this undetermined; and I hope, if you <HI>can</HI>
wan∣der from home with any kind of satisfaction, you will do me the justice
to believe, that you have no friend alive who will more gladly re∣ceive you
than myself.</P>
<P>I have papered some rooms this last year, and would willingly
have you see them before their colours are vanished; which, I think, will
un∣avoidably be the case of <HI>one,</HI> before a second summer be half
concluded.</P>
<P>Thus is beauty as uncertain as either fortune or fame.</P>

<P>There is a most admirable piece of allegory on this head in the
Female Fables, by Brooks, if I mistake not; to whom the author in his

<P>I am truly sorry to understand how much you are alone; I really
imagined you were much happier in point of company than myself, as you live
in a much politer neighbourhood; amongst persons of genius, learning and

else besides the spleen.</P>
<P>Do not dwell too much on subjects that make you thoughtful;

<P>I have not been forgetful of the task that you enjoined me, to
give you my observations on the verses which you inclosed.—I will

<OPENER><DATELINE>The Leasows, 
<DATE>Feb. 17, 1753.</DATE></DATELINE> 
<SALUTE>Dear Mr. Jago,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I WROTE you some account of myself, and inclosed some
trivial criticisms, in a letter I sent you about a fortnight ago, which I
hope you have received.—Tom comes now to enquire after your health, and
to bring back my ode to Colonel Lyttelton; in regard to which, I desire, that
you will not be sparing of your animadver∣sions. I whispered my
difficulties to Mr. Miller at Hagley, how delicate I found the subject, and
how hard it was to satisfy either myself or others; in all which points he
agreed with me. Nevertheless, having twice broke my <HI>promise</HI> of
sending a corrected copy to Sir George, I was obliged to make my peace by a
<HI>fresh</HI> one, which, I suppose, I must, of necessity,
perform.—Give me your whole sentiments hereupon, I beseech you; in
particular and in general, as a critic and as a friend.—The bad state
of spirits which I complained of in my last, for a long time to∣gether made
me utterly irresolute: every thing occasioned me suspence; and I did
nothing with appetite.—This was owing in a great measure to a slow
nervous fever, as I have since discovered by many concurrent symptoms. It
is now, I think, wearing off by degrees. I seem to anti∣cipate 
<PB N="160" REF="177"/> a little of that 
<Q REND="inline">"vernal delight"</Q> which Milton mentions, and
thinks 
<Q> 
<L>Able to chase</L> 
<L>All sadness, but despair.</L></Q> At least, I begin to
resume my silly clue of hopes and expectations; which, I know, however,
<HI>will</HI> not guide me to any thing more satisfactory than before.</P>
<P>I have read scarce any new books this season. Voltaire's new
Tragedy was sent me from Lon∣don; but what has given me the most
amuse∣ment, <HI>has</HI> been the 
<Q REND="inline">"Lettres de Madame de Maintenon."</Q> You have
probably read them already in English, and then I need not recom∣mend them.
The Life of Lord Bolingbroke is entirely his <HI>public</HI> life, and the book
three parts filled with political remarks.</P>
<P>As to <HI>writing,</HI> I have not attempted it this year and more;
nor do I know when I shall again.—However, I would be glad to correct
that Ode 
<Q REND="inline">"To the Dutchess of Somerset,"</Q> when once I
can find in whose hands it is depo∣sited. I was <HI>shewn</HI> a very
elegant letter of hers, the other day; wherein she asks for it with great
politeness. And as it includes nothing but a love of rural life, and such
sort of amuse∣ments as she herself approves, I shall stand a good
chance of having it received with partia∣lity. She lives the life of a
<HI>religieuse.</HI> She has <HI>written</HI> my Lady Luxborough a very
serious let∣ter of condolance upon the misfortune in her family; and need
enough has Lady Luxborough of so unchangeable a friend! for sure nothing
could have happened to a person in her situation more
<HI>specifically</HI> unfortunate.—Mr. Reynolds has been at Barrels, I
hear, and has brought her a machine that goes into a coat-pocket, yet
an∣swers the end of 
<Q REND="inline">"a jack for boots, a reading-desk, 
<PB N="161" REF="178"/> a cribbage-board, a pair of snuffers, a ruler, an
eighteen inch-rule, three pair of nut-cracks, a lemon-squeezer, two
candlesticks, a picquet board, and the Lord knows what
be∣side."—</Q>Can you form an idea of it? if you can, do you not think
it must give me pain to reflect, that I myself am useful for <HI>no</HI>
sort of pur∣pose, when a paltry bit of wood can answer so
<HI>many?</HI> but, indeed, whilst it <HI>pretends</HI> to these exploits,
it performs nothing <HI>well</HI>; and therein I agree with it. So true it is,
with regard to me, what I told you long ago, 
<Q> 
<L>Multa &amp; praeclara minantem</L> 
<L>Vivere nec recte, nec suaviter!</L></Q></P>
<P>We have a turnpike bill upon the point of be∣ing brought into the
House of Commons; it will convey you about half the way betwixt Birmingham
and Hales, and from thence to Hagley; but, I trust, there will be a <HI>left
hand</HI> attraction, which will always make you deviate from the strait
line.</P>
<P>I should be ashamed to reflect how much I have dwelt upon
<HI>myself</HI> in this letter; but that I seriously approve of egotism
in letters; and were I <HI>not</HI> to do so, I should not have any other
subject. I have not a single neighbour, that is either fraught with
politeness, literature, or in∣telligence; much less have I a tide of
spirits to set my invention afloat; but the less I am able to amuse
<HI>you,</HI> the more desirous am I of your let∣ters; which afford me the
truest entertainment, even when my spirits are ever so much
de∣pressed.</P>
<P>That universal chearfulness which is the lot of some people,
persons that you and I may <HI>envy</HI> at the same time that we
<HI>despise,</HI> is worth all that either fortune or nature can
bestow.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>The Leasows, 
<DATE>Mar. 28, 1753.</DATE></DATELINE> 
<SALUTE>Dear Mr. Graves,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM vexed to find you have no copy of those verses.—I
must make a fresh enquiry; and should they happen to accompany this
let∣ter, as I fear they will <HI>not,</HI> be so good as to assist me
all you can in the way of <HI>hints</HI> and <HI>corrections.</HI> Corrections
of what <HI>is,</HI> and hints of what <HI>may be.</HI> I do not reckon much
upon these verses, or the patronage which you mention; though the
Dutchess is a woman of high reputation, and has as much benevolence as any
woman upon earth.</P>
<P>I do <HI>not</HI> include the design of visiting Bath as a
public place: I have long since given up such schemes of gaiety and
expence. I visit <HI>you</HI> and <HI>Mrs. Graves;</HI> at the least, I
mean to do so.</P>
<P>Inoculatioin is a point on which I never speak a syllable in the
way of <HI>pro</HI> or <HI>con:</HI> I mean, not so as to influence
particulars; for, in the gene∣ral, I esteem it both right and salutary, and
even <HI>right</HI> because we <HI>find</HI> it <HI>salutary.</HI></P>
<P>I do not know whether I could not bear the <HI>dishonour</HI> of
friends or relations better than their <HI>death.</HI>—It must afford
one no small satisfaction to give them one's affection and assistance
under every frailty to which human nature is exposed; at least, so long
as they are true to friendship. It is Mr. Whistler's opinion, as well as
mine. But Mr. —'s case is altogether different; and I make no
question that he thinks as you do up∣on the occasion.</P>
<P>Poor Danvers's death affects me more than you would perhaps imagine.
If you remember, I was at M— when the scheme of his going abroad was in
agitation.—I think how this event must affect Mrs. T—, whose
concern will not <PB N="163" REF="182"/> be <HI>lessened</HI> by her long
separation from him. I dare say he reckoned upon his relations here as his
<HI>best estate,</HI> whatever he might gain elsewhere; and, no doubt,
the hope of retiring amongst them has been a constant spur to his
diligence.—The event was always uncertain, and has proved at last
unfortunate; yet, as Melmoth says very justly, 
<Q REND="inline">"The course of human affairs requires that we
should act with vigour upon very pre∣carious contingencies."—</Q>I
desire you would give me a sight of the Latin inscription.</P>
<P>I think it was the Gentleman's Magazine in which I was shewn your
verses.</P>
<P>I have a particular and lively idea of your place; though I do not
remember to have seen even such <HI>parts</HI> of a scene as I have
united to∣gether in my imagination. I cannot think other∣wise than that the
front-door opens here, the garden-door there, the stream runs in this place,
&amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<Q>Hac ibat Simois, haec est Sigeia tellus.</Q>
<P>The sight of the place could not impress my imagination more
deeply; though the impression I <HI>am to</HI> acquire will hardly leave
one line of my present one remaining. <HI>Cabbage-garden ornée</HI> is
very high burlesque, and affects the improve∣ments of your friend too
nearly.</P>
<P>Let me know in what manner Mrs. Graves and you are drawn. Be as
particular as you please.</P>
<P>I could not be clear from your letter whether you had received the
box or not. That, toge∣ther with the tallies, lay on the table before me, while
I wrote to you last; and went with my letter to Birmingham.—Pray
satisfy me directly whether you received them.—They are trifles,
indeed; but, as they acquit me of my promise, they are virtually of
consequence.</P>
<P><PB N="164" REF="183"/>Mr. Whistler has not answered a letter
which I sent him above two months ago: nay, I think, a quarter of a year.</P>
<P>You are rich.—I have only to wish the conti∣nuance of your
riches, with some diminution of your fatigue. And yet the most laborious
man in the world is, I am fully assured, more happy than the
<HI>laziest.</HI></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">"The Rival Brothers"</Q> has some of Dr. Young's
affectations; and I question if the moral be ab∣solutely true—at
least, Mr. Addison is in some measure against it: but, on the whole,
I think it a noble Tragedy; abounding as much with re∣fined sentiments and
elevated expressions, as 
<Q REND="inline">"The Gamester"</Q> and 
<Q REND="inline">"The Earl of Essex"</Q> are deficient in
<HI>both.</HI></P>
<P>My verses are not yet sent to Sir George Lyt∣telton; <HI>I</HI>
start new difficulties, and cannot make them to my mind: yet have promised
him a copy, and disappointed him thrice; and can hard∣ly defer it much longer
without great offence.</P>
<P>I have scarce been twenty yards from home this winter. Last
night I visited one of my neigh∣bours; and what with wine, sitting up late,
a perfect flux of discourse, and a return home through the dark, found
myself <HI>vertiginous</HI> before I was aware. Never did Prior's manly
descrip∣tion, 
<Q REND="inline">"I drank, I liked it not, &amp;c."</Q> seem so
na∣tural to me as it does to-day. I am absolutely vile in my own sight, and
I abhor myself in dust and ashes. I was <HI>never</HI> so intoxicated
as not to know what I said, or to talk more non∣sense; and yet how many
things could I wish unsaid that I let fall last night!</P>
<P>We are going to add two new bells to our present set of six;
to have a turnpike-road from Hagley to Birmingham, through Hales; and to emerge
a little from our obscurity. I am, dear Sir, with compliments to Mrs.
Graves,</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>The Leasows, 
<DATE>July 25, 1753.</DATE></DATELINE> 
<SALUTE>Dear Mr. Graves,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I SEND you my Ode, as I sent it to the Dutchess some weeks
ago. Why I pitched upon one reading sooner than another, I will not now
explain: nor will I trouble you to make any fresh remarks upon it at
present; only, when you happen to read it over at your leisure, if any
thing occurs to you that would tend to perfect it, I would beg you
occasionally to make some memorandums. I have not yet received an answer;
but, as I accompanied the verses with a letter, I suppose I shall
receive one in re∣turn. I also added, to fill a blank space in my
paper-book, a poem which I call 
<Q REND="inline">"The Vista;"</Q> and which you may perhaps
recollect: how pro∣perly I know not, for I had the benefit of no person's
<HI>judgement</HI> or advice.</P>
<P>Lord Dudley made Mr. Dolman a present of a piece of plate, a large
cup, in consideration of his sister's being at Broom about half a year.
There was on it, one supporter awkwardly enough holding up the coronet in his
paw; and from the coronet proceeded a label, with 
<Q REND="inline">"amo∣ris ergo Dudley."</Q> I do not know who was the
manager, or whence he had the inscription; but I think, from Dr. H—.
This is <HI>elegant</HI> and <HI>enough.</HI> Nevertheless, as there may be
some con∣venience in dazzling the eyes of the people where I dwell, and as
<HI>such</HI> eyes as theirs are not to be dazzled, and hardly
<HI>struck,</HI> by <HI>elegance</HI> alone, I chose the method that was
most <HI>magni∣ficent.</HI>—I wish they are not invidious enough to
say, that <HI>his</HI> arms are engraved there for want of some of my
<HI>own:</HI> so I would not be long be∣fore their notable
suggestion.—I have truly so <PB N="166" REF="185"/> low an opinion
of arms since they became pur∣chaseable by money, and since the present
un∣limited use of them, that were I to find a coat to my name in the office,
which I did not like, I would not use it; but substitute what was more
agreeable: yet some <HI>sort</HI> of <HI>right</HI> or <HI>claim</HI> is
re∣quisite to satisfy one's delicacy, with an opinion of <HI>property</HI>;
and indeed, to fix one's <HI>choice,</HI> where one has the whole furniture of
the universe for <HI>its</HI> object.—After all, the vulgar are more
struck with arms than any thing; 
<Q REND="inline">"stupet in titulis &amp; imaginibus;"</Q> and, I
believe, there were near two hundred people gathered round Lady Lux∣borough's
landau at Birmingham, and declaring her arms to be very <HI>noble,</HI> or
otherwise.—I do not, therefore, chuse to employ a vulgar
<HI>mind</HI> about this matter.—Were you to go London, I should gladly
solicit <HI>you</HI>; or if you have any friend you could write to in town,
to search the office; for really I have none that I like <HI>for the
purpose.</HI> It will not cost above a couple of shil∣lings.—I will
send you a draught of the lid of my standish when it arrives:—for I
really do not know what Mr. Hylton will put upon it: I find, he consults with
Dr. B—, my Lord's physician.—
<Q REND="inline">"<HI>De</HI> Dudley"</Q> would run most
abominably, and 
<Q REND="inline">"Baro Dudley"</Q> may be authorized by the fre∣quent
practice of Maittaire.—If it be inscribed 
<Q REND="inline">"Dudley"</Q> <HI>alone,</HI> I can add the rest if
I should hereafter think proper; and I wish it may be so.</P>
<P>My verses to the Colonel are not yet transcrib∣ed.</P>
<P>I think the Latin inscription to your brother very elegant; and I
should not care to have any part of it omitted.—I would, by all means,
have this little history of his life perpetuated. 
<Q REND="inline">"His saltem, &amp;c."</Q> And were you to put it
into English, it would be too long for an inscription;—unless you
were, by means of a printed elegy with notes, or any other such method, to
pro∣duce <PB N="167" REF="186"/> the same effect; and then you might make the
epitaph as short as you pleased.—After all the <HI>first</HI>
method is perhaps as eligible. When the affair is nearer a conclusion, I
should be glad to be of any service.—I will think, and write again
about it,</P>
<P>And now, having spoke to such matters as have been the subject
of our late correspondence, I am at liberty to diversify my letter as I
may.—I should be glad to know in your next whether you have heard of
late from Mr. Whistler; and whether he is confined at home as usual by his
mother's state of health. I almost despair of ever seeing him again at
The Leasows, though there is hardly any pleasure I so much covet as that
of surprizing him with the <HI>alterations</HI> I have <HI>made,</HI> and the
<HI>articles</HI> I have <HI>purchased,</HI> during the five years since he
was in Shropshire: add to this, the several <HI>acquaintances</HI> I have
formed which he would like, and the amusing visits I could pay hereabouts
with freedom.—I do not know whether you saw Mr. Davenport and his
family at Bath this spring. He is laying out his environs, and I am by
appointment to go over the week after next. He has also a painter at this
time taking views round his house; which is one of the most magnificent in
our country; yet I never leave home but with reluctance.—I real∣ly
<HI>love</HI> no PLACE so well; and it is a great favour in me to allot any
one a week of my <HI>summer.</HI>—Add to this, that my constitution
requires nur∣sing; and I am most <HI>happy,</HI> where I am most
<HI>free.</HI> It is in vain to say, they <HI>allow</HI> you all freedom,
where you cannot allow it <HI>yourself.</HI> For this reason, I never more
enjoy myself, than I do at The Grange; and yet this to some may appear
paradoxical.</P>
<P>I yesterday embellished my chalybeate spring.—The
inscription that is <HI>out</HI> on the stone, is as follows, viz. 
<Q><PB N="168" REF="187"/> FONS FERRVGINEVS. <LB/>DIVAE QVAE SECRSSV

<HEAD>LXXV. To Mr. JAGO.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>The Leasows, 
<DATE>Jan. 29, 1754.</DATE></DATELINE> 
<SALUTE>Dear Mr. Jago,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM at a loss how to begin this letter.—I will not,
however, after the usual way, give you a tedious list of <HI>apologies</HI>
in the front of it. Some account of my long silence you will find
dispersed throughout the letter; and as for what is deficient, I will
depend upon your friendship.</P>
<P>There has not been a person here since you left me, of whom I
could obtain the least in∣telligence concerning you. And as an enquiry by the
post was my only obvious method, I do acknowledge myself to blame,
notwithstanding all the excuses that I can make.</P>
<P>Amidst the conflux of visitants whom I re∣ceived this
season, I was hardly once <HI>so</HI> happy as I was in <HI>your</HI>
company. I was the happier in seeing <HI>you</HI> so; and, if you remember,
I took notice at the time, how little your vivacity was impaired in
comparison of my own. If I was <HI>then</HI> but a dull <HI>companion,</HI>
guess whether solitude and winter were likely to make me a better
<HI>cor∣respondent.</HI> That vein of gaiety and humour, which you were once
so partial as to discover in my letters, will scarce appear there any
more: not even to the eyes of the most partial friend I have. Should you deny
what I assert, and im∣pute it to a fit of spleen, yet you may
<HI>allow</HI> that it will scarce enliven any letter that I write in
<HI>winter.</HI> Friendship still remains! Friendship, like the root of
some perennial flower, even <HI>then</HI> perhaps gathers strength in
secret; that it may afford a better display of its colours in the
spring.</P>
<P>I do not pretend this to be an adequate apo∣logy. I know, my
dearest friend, that you both <HI>like</HI> to see and hear from me: it
proves, however, <PB N="170" REF="189"/> that you have no great <HI>loss</HI>
either of my letters or my company.</P>
<P>I am, as the phrase is, deeply penetrated by the civilities of
your Mr. Miller. He took a short dinner with me once this season,
dropping Sir George at Mr. P—'s.—He could not have pleased me
better.—Here he happened to meet Mr. Lyttelton and Captain Whood. He
after∣wards breakfasted here, and in general seemed glad of every
occasion to bring me the genteelest company. To him I owe Miss Banks and
Lord Temple. Can you think that Radway now, as well as Harbury, has no
attractions for me? You know me too well; but I have not truly such a state
of health as to dare to be from home. Friends will say 
<Q REND="inline">"you may be as free at our houses as your own,
&amp;c."</Q> and they will <HI>mean</HI> as they <HI>say;</HI> but if you
cannot make <HI>yourself</HI> so, what is all this to the purpose?</P>
<P>I cannot give you a detail of what has passed with me since I
saw you. Lord Dudley, with myself, made one visit to Lord Plymouth's. We
met Mr. and Mrs. Winnington.—We took a trip to Mr. Vernon's, where we
found Mr. Coventry and other company. The impressions I received from them
would afford subject for <HI>conversation</HI> betwixt you and me; but I
must not assign too much of my paper to that pur∣pose.</P>
<P>Lord Plymouth's piece of water should have been a serpentine
river. I could give you strong reasons.—I think my Lord such a
character as will make a reputable figure in life:—<HI>beloved</HI> he
<HI>is,</HI> and <HI>must</HI> be at first sight.—Lady Plymouth is
the most amiable of women; and, of all the world, the properest person
that my Lord could have chosen. The plan for their house I think right;
supposing it right to continue it where it is. The park is capable of
some considerable beauties. Lord Plymouth has been once here 
<PB N="171" REF="190"/> since, and talks of causing me to come, and design
for his environs.—I seem to be highly in his favour.—I hope
some time to meet you there.</P>
<P>My Ode, after an astonishing delay, was pre∣sented to the
Dutchess of Somerset.—It produced me two genteel letters from her
Grace. I am well satisfied with the event, for some reasons, which I will
one day give you—none of mo∣ment.—Soon after this, Dodsley
pressed me to contribute, as amply as I pleased, to a fourth volume of
his Miscellanies. I at first meant to do so pretty largely; I then
changed my mind, and sent only some little pieces. Part of these were my
own; part Mr. Whistler's, Mr. Graves's, and some accidental pieces of
others, which I found in my bureau.—I purposed to send something of
yours too; of <HI>myself,</HI> if I was <HI>hurried</HI>; else, not without
your consent. What I thought of was, your Linnets. Last week he writes me
word, that the town will now be too much engrossed by the business of
elections; and that he does not proceed this winter.—So that we shall
now, you see, have time to meet, or write upon the subject.</P>
<P>Mr. Graves sent me the enclosed little, fable, for Dodsley, if
I approved it.—I made some al∣terations, and sent it.—Return it
to me, if you please.—It is pretty; but the inscription must be 
<Q REND="inline">"To a Friend."</Q></P>
<P>Some correspondence I have had this winter with Mr. Hylton, about
toys and trinkets which he gets done for me in London. He is by far a better
<HI>friend</HI> and <HI>correspondent</HI> than a <HI>poet.</HI> Should you
take a trip to town, he would be quite <HI>proud</HI> to see you.</P>
<P>I am now, like the rest of the world, peru∣sing Sir Charles
Grandison.—I know not whe∣ther that world <HI>joins</HI> me, in
preferring Clarissa. The author wants the art of <HI>abridgement</HI> in
every <PB N="172" REF="191"/> thing that he has written, yet I am much his
admirer.</P>
<P>My dear friend! cherish and preserve your own vivacity, and let
not this phlegmatic epistle impair it. If occasion offers, call on me for
my <HI>own</HI> sake; and believe you have not alive a more affectionate
friend.</P>

Pain.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>The Leasows, 
<DATE>April 19, 1754.</DATE></DATELINE> 
<SALUTE>Dear Mr. Graves,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is a long, long time, according to the com∣putation of
friendship, since I had the plea∣sure of a line from you, and I write
chiefly to remind you of it; not with any hopes of af∣fording you the
amusement of a single minute. In truth, I have not spirits for it. The
severity, the duration, the solitude, of this winter have well-nigh
exhausted them.—The succession, the regular succession, of
pain and pleasure becomes every day more clear to me. It begins to seem as
ordinary as the course of day and night. Thus my last summer was the
most amusing I ever saw; my winter the most disagreeable. Allow me to
accept one only: I mean, that ever-mourn∣ful winter which robbed me of my
dearest rela∣tion. Sometimes this pain and pleasure are contrasted within
the compass of a day. Some∣times, in different weeks, &amp;c. &amp;c.
However, do not think me superstitious. There is hardly a person that is
<HI>less</HI> so. Yet I am firmly persuad∣ed of the alternation, either
in the mind, or in the events themselves. My summer, I said be∣fore, was
highly entertaining; my winter render∣ed <PB N="173" REF="192"/> equally
disagreeable, by a long-continued squabble amongst our principal
parishioners, and by the death of my best-beloved and the most
accomplished of my relations, M— D—. She risqued going to
London for the sake of finding something <HI>new</HI>; was seized with
the small-pox, and died in all her bloom.—The natural conse∣quence
which we should draw from observations of this sort is, equanimity; 
<Q REND="inline">"aequam memento rebus, &amp;c."</Q> and again, 
<Q REND="inline">"sperat infestis me∣tuit secundis,
&amp;c."</Q> Enough of this, which I should not mention, but that the fact
itself strikes me continually more and more; and were I to mark the
pleasing and unpleasing parts of my existence in an almanac, as the
Romans did their <HI>Fasti</HI> and <HI>Nefasti,</HI> I know not if, at the
year's end, the black and white marks would not nearly balance each other.</P>
<P>I have bought Hogarth's Analysis: it is really entertaining; and
has, in some measure, ad∣justed my notions with regard to beauty in
ge∣neral. For instance, were I to draw a shield, I could give you reasons
from hence why the shape was pleasing or disagreeable. I would have you
<HI>borrow</HI> and read it.</P>
<P>Grandison I cannot think equal to Clarissa; though, were merit
in this age to be preferred, the author of it deserves a bishoprick.</P>
<P>Jago has been fortunate for once; but the value of his livings
must be exaggerated in the news-papers.</P>
<P>If Mr. Whistler would give me a visit in the height of my
season this year, I would look upon it as one of the most pleasing
events that could happen to the remainder of my life; and I would not presume
to hope that fate would ever allow me a repetition of it.</P>
<P>My love of toys is not quite exhausted.—I have purchased, or
rather renovated, some that are both rich and beautiful, though short of 
<PB N="174" REF="193"/> what I meant them. I have amused myself with
designing little ornaments this winter, some of which may turn to account
under the manage∣ment of some Birmingham mechanic.—To at∣chieve
<HI>ease,</HI> in that season, is the most, that I can <HI>hope</HI>;
and it is more than I often <HI>obtain.</HI></P>
<P>Excuse this worthless letter; which <HI>must</HI> cost you
money, as they tell me franks are useless. I could not avoid some
uneasiness upon reflect∣ing how long you have been silent. Present my
best compliments to Mrs. Graves; and pay a tribute of one single
half-sheet to that affection with which I am ever</P>

<SALUTE>Dear Mr. Graves,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE melancholy account of our dear friend Whistler's death was
conveyed to me, at the same instant, by yours and by his brother's letter.
I have written to his brother this post: though I am very ill able to write
upon the subject, and would willingly have waved it longer, but for decency.
The trium∣virate which was the greatest happiness, and the greatest
pride, of my life is broken! The fabric of an ingenuous and disinterested
friendship has lost a noble column! yet it may, and <HI>will,</HI> I
trust, endure till one of us be laid as low. In truth, one can so little
satisfy one's self with what we say upon such sad occasions, that I
made three or <PB N="175" REF="194"/> four essays before I could
<HI>endure</HI> what I had writ∣ten to his brother.—Be so good as to
excuse me to him as well as you can, and establish me in the good opinion
of him and Mr. Walker.</P>
<P>Poor Mr. Whistler! how do all our little strifes and bickerments
appear to us at this time! yet we may with comfort reflect, that they were not
of a <HI>sort</HI> that touched the <HI>vitals</HI> of our friendship; and
I may say that we fondly loved and esteemed each other, of ne∣cessity. 
<Q REND="inline">"Tales animas <HI>oportuit</HI> esse
concordes."</Q> Poor Mr. Whistler! not a single acquaintance have I made,
not a single picture or curiosity have I purchased, not a single
embellishment have I given to my place, since he was last here, but I
have had his approbation and his amusement in my eye. I will assuredly
inscribe my larger urn to his memory; nor shall I pass it without a
pleasing melancholy during the remainder of my days. We have each of us
received a plea∣sure from <HI>his</HI> conversation, which no other
conversation can afford us at our present time of life.</P>
<P>Adieu! my dear friend! may our remem∣brance of the person we have
lost be the strong and everlasting cement of our affection! Assure
Mr. John Whistler of the regard I have for him, upon his <HI>own</HI>
account, as well as his brother's. Write to me; directly if you have
opportunity. Whether you have or no, believe me to be ever most
affectionately yours.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>The Leasows,

<SALUTE>Dear Mr. Graves,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE <HI>particulars</HI> relating to our poor friend's departure
occasioned me much concern, and indeed some tears: yet as <HI>those</HI>
particulars are what one covets to hear, and the melan∣choly which they produce
is never unmixed with pleasure, I think myself much obliged to you for the
care you took to convey them. It is possible, the letters I wrote to you
and Mr. J. Whistler might appear too tender from a <HI>mere</HI> friend of
the deceased; but there is a sympathy betwixt friends, which is not always
found amongst relations; nor does <HI>kindred</HI> imply
<HI>friend∣ship</HI> a whit more than <HI>friendship</HI> does
<HI>kindred.</HI> It is not many weeks ago, that I had a bill filed against
me in Chancery by young D—, the only near relation I have by the mother's
side; and the next in lineal succession to my share of the Penn's
estate.—Do not let this surprize you. I believe the affair will be
accommodated.—He only wanted to procure a division of the Harbo∣rough
estate at a large expence, which might be better adjusted without
<HI>any</HI>; in other words, to run his head against a stone-wall, that he
might have a chance of causing it to tumble upon <HI>me.</HI> Would you
consent that I should suffer him to have the mansion-house at
Harborough thrown into his lot? Were I so to do, I could make it advantageous
to myself, and the dispute were at an end; but I have a kind of romantic
venera∣tion for that <HI>place</HI> and <HI>family</HI>; which, if you
re∣member, I have expressed in one of my best elegies<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Elegy xv.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="177" REF="196"/>Pray what will become of our letters to Mr.
Whistler? as I am not conscious of any thing dishonourable in mine (and I
am <HI>sure</HI> I may say the same of yours) methinks I could wish
that they might not be destroyed. It is from a few letters of my own or
others alone, acciden∣tally preserved, that I am able to recollect what I
have been doing since I was born.</P>
<P>I met, when I was last at Barrels, a surgeon of Bath, whose
name, I think, was Cleland. He knew your name and place; but, I find, was not
personally acquainted with you.—I am glad enough to hear that your
place gets into vogue. It is, I think, what you should <HI>chuse,</HI> upon
all accounts. Let the beauty of the place guide them to the merits of its
<HI>owner.</HI> I have often thought, myself, that were a person to live at
The Leasows, of more merit than myself, and a few degrees more worldly
prudence, he could scarce want opportunities to procure his own ad∣vancement.
My rural embellishments are per∣haps more considerable than yours; but then
the vicinity of Bath might occasion you a greater conflux.—Your
unexpensive illuminations please me highly.—I have purposed these
many years to purchase a set of tin lamps, of about four-pence a-piece, to
stick against trees, and to use upon occasion in my coppice; or rather
in my grove, where some of the water-falls would not fail to shew
delightfully.</P>
<P>You asked me about Jago's preferment. The living <HI>last
given</HI> him by the Bishop of Worcester is, I believe, near an hundred
pounds a year.—With this, he has Harbury of about fifty; and
Cheslerton, a sort of chapel of ease, about forty; in the <HI>whole,</HI>
therefore, about a hundred and ninety: but then he is obliged to keep a curate;
and what I think yet worse is, that he cannot make it <HI>convenient</HI> to
<HI>live</HI> at his new situation, which is a pretty one.</P>
<P><PB N="178" REF="197"/>I have had some visitants this season;
indeed as many, and as considerable, as such a sort of season could
afford me. A Scotch peer called upon me in his way through Birmingham: his
title was —. He seemed to have a very clear head, a very polite and
easy manner, and all the refinement of true taste, <HI>without</HI> the
warmth or appetite.—I could not help thinking him, on many accounts,
characteristic of the Scottish na∣tion.</P>
<P>Would to God I could see you and Mrs. Graves here this summer! I
have the same wish it may be <HI>my</HI> lot to visit <HI>you,</HI> next
autumn. Be assured, I <HI>purpose</HI> it.</P>
<P>I expect Dodsley every week. He will, I am convinced, be for
publishing his Miscellany next winter. Would Mr. W—, think you,
agree, that you and I should be allowed to publish such of poor Mr.
Whistler's papers there, as we judged were most likely to do credit to his
memory?</P>
<P>Adieu! dear Mr. Graves. Let us reconcile our affections to the
ordinary events of life; and let us adopt my friend Jago into our second
triumvirate. I am, however, always, with <HI>pe∣culiar</HI> attachment,
yours,</P>

<P>P. S. Since I wrote the foregoing, I have had Mr. Davenport of
Davenport-house, with all his family.—His brother, the clergyman,

Ayles∣bury—ingenious, easy-behaved, and of an ex∣cellent

<OPENER><DATELINE>The Leasows,

<SALUTE>Dear Mr. Graves,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is certainly some argument of a <HI>peculiarity</HI> in the
esteem I bear you, that I feel a readiness to acquaint you with
<HI>more</HI> of my foibles, than I care to trust with any other person. I
believe no∣thing shews us more plainly either the different <HI>degrees</HI>
or <HI>kinds</HI> of regard that we entertain for our several friends (I may
also add the <HI>difference</HI> of their <HI>characters</HI>) than the
ordinary style and tenour of the letters we address to them.</P>
<P>I confess to <HI>you,</HI> that I am considerably morti∣fied by
Mr. John W—'s conduct in regard to my letters to his brother; and, rather
than they should have been so unneccessarily destroyed, would have
given more money than is allowable for me to mention with <HI>decency.</HI> I
look upon my letters as some of <HI>my</HI> chef-d'oeuvres; and, could I be
supposed to have the least pretensions to propriety of style or
sentiment, I should ima∣gine it must appear, principally, in my letters
to his brother, and one or two more friends. I considered them as the records
of a <HI>friendship</HI> that will be always <HI>dear</HI> to me; and as the
<HI>history</HI> of my <HI>mind</HI> for these twenty years last past.
The amusement I should have found in the perusal of <PB N="180" REF="199"/> them would have been altogether innocent; and I would gladly have
preserved them, if it were only to explain those which I shall preserve
of his brother's. Why he should allow either <HI>me</HI> or <HI>them</HI>
so very little weight as not to <HI>consult</HI> me with regard to them, I
can by no means conceive. I suppose it is not <HI>uncustomary</HI> to
return them to the surviving friend. I had no answer to the letter which I
wrote Mr. J. W—. I received a ring from him; but as I thought it an
inadequate memorial of the friendship which his brother had for me, I gave it
to my servant the moment I received it; at the same time I have a neat
standish, on which I caused the lines Mr. W— left with it to be
inscribed; and which appears to me a much more agreeable remembrancer.</P>
<P>I have read your new production with plea∣sure; and as this letter
begins with a confession of foibles, I will own, that through mere
lazi∣ness I have sent you back your copy, in which I have made some
erasements, instead of giving you my reasons on which those
erasements were founded. Truth is, it seems to me to want mighty few
variations from what is now the present text; and that, upon one more
perusal, you will be able to give it as much perfection as you mean it to
have. And yet, did I suppose you would insert it in Dodsley's
Collection, as I see no reason you have to the contrary, I would take any
pains about it that you should desire me. I must beg another copy, at
your leisure.</P>
<P>I should like the inscription you mention upon a real
stone-urn, which you purchase very rea∣sonable at Bath; but you must
not risque it up∣on the vase you mention, on any account what∣ever.</P>
<P>Now I mention Bath, I must acquaint you, that I have received
intelligence from the younger Dodsley, that his brother is now there, and
that <PB N="181" REF="200"/> none of the papers I sent him are yet <HI>sent
to press</HI>; that he expects his brother home about the fourth or fifth of
November, when he proceeds with his publication. Possibly you may go to
Bath whilst he is there, and, if so, may chuse to have an interview.</P>
<P>I shall send two or three little pieces of my own, in hopes that
you will adjust the reading, and return them as soon as you conveniently
can. All I can send to-night is this 
<Q REND="inline">"Ode to Memory."</Q> I shall in the last place
desire your opinion as to the manner of <HI>placing</HI> what is sent. The
first pages of his Miscellany must be already fixed. I think to propose
ours for the last; but as to the <HI>order,</HI> it will depend entirely upon
you.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>The Leasows, 
<DATE>June 16, 1754.</DATE></DATELINE> 
<SALUTE>Dear Mr. Jago,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WERE I to pronounce my sentence upon the long suspension of
our correspon∣dence, I should impute the blame of it, in al∣most
<HI>equal</HI> measure, to <HI>yourself</HI> and to <HI>me.</HI> To
<HI>you,</HI> for an omission of the letter you <HI>promised</HI> me,
when last in town; to me, for waiting in ex∣pectation of it, and for
neglecting to do <HI>justice</HI> to the sentiments of my heart on the
occasion of your late preferment. Great were the hopes I had indeed
conceived, that your increase of re∣venue had been accompanied with a place
of re∣sidence which was more <HI>to your mind</HI> than that 
<PB N="182" REF="201"/> where you at present abide; but I do not find by any
accounts that you purpose to leave Har∣bury; for which, no doubt, you have
reasons which I do not yet penetrate; but which may demand my assent the
moment you discover them. I have but little to say of the life I have led
since you received some account of me from Mr. Hyl∣ton in London. The
Winter, or at least its <HI>mi∣nisters,</HI> continued to tyrannize during
the <HI>minority</HI> of Spring; and the Spring has alike been slow in giving
up the reins to Summer. Of conse∣quence, I seem in a sort of middle
state, betwixt a dull half-animated grub, and an insignificant loco-motive
fly. Neither in the <HI>one</HI> state or <HI>other</HI> am I of the least
importance; but, from the ad∣vances which I have <HI>already</HI> made, you are
<HI>some∣what</HI> the more likely to find me in your garden. About a
fortnight ago I received a line or two from our intimate acquaintance and
school-fel∣low Mr. Hall. It was brought me by Sir Ed∣ward Boughton's
gardener; a fellow of good taste, to whom Mr. Hall desired I would cause
The Leasows to be shewn. I find you have de∣lighted Mrs. Hall by some
alterations which you propose for their environs, and which they tho∣roughly
resolve to put in execution. When I come over into Warwickshire, as I hope
to do soon, I shall be very glad to make them a visit in your company. My
spirits, though far from good, are better, in the main, than they were in
winter; and, on some peculiar days, are raised as high as to <HI>alacrity:
very</HI> seldom higher; sel∣dom so high.</P>
<P>You must (from hence at least) take matters in the order or
rather <HI>disorder</HI> in which they occur: Mr. Miller I saw on
Wednesday last in Lady Lyttelton's coach, who stopped two minutes at my
gate on her return from London. I enquired concerning you; but could gather no
intelligence.—Mr. Hylton, who is now in Warwickshire (if 
<PB N="183" REF="202"/> he have not strolled to London) has been with me
several months this summer. He is adding a room or two to his place, which
lies very near me; and purposes to reside there as soon as it is
finished. The situation is not void of beauties; but, if you will pardon
the vanity, must veil its bonnet to mine. I have heard of planting hollies,
pyracanthas, and other berry-bearing greens, to attract those Black-birds
which you have so ef∣fectually celebrated: it shall be <HI>my</HI> ambition
to plant good neighbours; and, what with Lord Dudley and his exotics, Mr.
Hylton with his fossils, and myself with my <HI>ferme ornée,</HI>
is there not some room to expect that we may attract the tasters this way?
but first we must take some care to <HI>advertise</HI> them where their
treasures lie.—Another day is passed, and Mr. Miller, &amp;c. has
again been with me, and waked me out of a sound sleep to
breakfast.—He mentions with what reluctance he <HI>left</HI> a
surveyor at Radway, em∣ployed in taking plans of the field of battle near
Edge-hill. This he purposes to enrich with a number of anecdotes, gleaned
from his neighbourhood; which must probably render it extremely entertaining:
and surely Edge-bill fight was never more unfortunate to the nation, than it
was lucky for Mr. Miller. He prints, to∣gether with this plan, another sheet
of Radway Castle. I approve his design. He will, by these means, turn
every bank and hillock of his estate there, if not into
<HI>classical,</HI> at least into <HI>historical</HI> ground.</P>
<P>I have done mighty little about my grounds since last winter. As
indolence has on <HI>many</HI> oc∣casions contributed to <HI>impair</HI> my
finances, it is but just that it should sometimes contribute to
<HI>restore</HI> them. Yet I am not quite destitute of something new for
your amusement.</P>
<P>Of late I have neither <HI>read</HI> nor <HI>written</HI> a
syl∣lable. What pleased me last was Hogarth's Ana∣lysis. 
<PB N="184" REF="203"/> I expect Dodsley down every week; and as he will
spend a few days with me, I could wish you were to meet him. His genius is
truly poetical, and his sentiments altogether liberal and ingenuous.</P>
<P>I am, at present, a surveyor of roads: em∣ployed in repairing my
lane to the turnpike—How glad should I be to meet you, and to shew
you its <HI>beauties!</HI> to shew you Mr. Hylton's new series of coins;
—his <HI>designs</HI> as well as his <HI>per∣formances</HI> at
Lappa!—how glad should I be to see you! yea, I would hardly fail to
return with you to Harbury; were you to add this one obligation. I left Mr.
Miller in doubt whether he would not see me at Radway some time next week.
Evil and capricious health (the particu∣lars of which would make a detail of no
im∣portance) destroys all my punctuality, and bids me promise with
<HI>fear.</HI> You, I trust, are mostly at home; and were you to be at
Snitterfield, I would follow you without reluctance. So, with hopes to see
you shortly, either in Warwick∣shire or Shropshire, I relinquish the
subject.</P>
<P>I have reserved a very melancholy subject for the last. May
you, and Mr. Graves, and myself, stand firm to support the fabric of
friendship, which has lost a very beautiful column in poor Mr. Whistler!
he died of a sore throat, which in a few days time turned to an inward
mortifi∣cation.—I will say no more on the occasion: very affecting
has it been to me.—God preserve your life, your happiness, and your
friendships! and may you ever be <HI>assured</HI> of <HI>that</HI> with
which I am, dear Sir,</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Your most affectionate humble servant, W.
SHENSTONE.</SIGNED> <POSTSCRIPT>
<P>Shall I beg a line from you, as soon as may be?—I do,
most earnestly.</P>
<P><PB N="185" REF="204"/>I am given to understand that I may expect
a visit this summer from the Bishop of Worcester; from Lord Ward, Lord
Coventry, and Lord Guernsey.—It may be so; but honours of <HI>this
sort,</HI> which would formerly have affected me, perhaps <HI>too</HI>
deeply, have now lost much of their wonted poignancy. Can <HI>such</HI>
persons bear to see the scenes <HI>riant,</HI> and to find the

be, it is no compliment to declare, that an hour or two's interview with you or
Mr. Graves outweighs the arrival of the whole British Peerage.</P>
<P>Something else I have to say. Young Pixell last winter told
me, that the organist of Wor∣cester had set your Ode (The Blackbirds) to
music; that he <HI>liked</HI> the music; and that he would sing it next
evening at the Birmingham concert. I have not heard him mention it
<HI>since,</HI> and I <HI>forgot</HI> to enquire; but, if you happen to have
the notes, I should be glad if you would inclose them for me.</P>
<P>I have been of late much bent upon the encrease of
<HI>horns</HI> in this neighbourhood.—Do not interpret me
<HI>perversely</HI>; I mean French horns only. My Lord Dudley has had a
person to teach two of his servants—nothing—at my
in∣stigation; but your old acquaintance Maurice, <HI>who lives at the corner
of my coppice,</HI> will exceed him in a week by means of a good ear. I have
borrowed a horn for him. Adieu!</P>

<SALUTE>Dear Mr. W—,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU do me justice in believing that I am truly sorry you have
not been well. A degree or two of regularity more than what you have already
will, I fancy, restore your health, and my satisfaction; and I beg you will
afford me the earliest account of your recovery.</P>
<P>I considered Master W—'s visit as an abso∣lute
engagement, and remained at home in con∣stant expectation of him for a
fortnight together.—I am, however, not sorry, for his own sake, that
he is gone to Oxford especially as you seem to have an assurance of its
proving advantage∣ous. Pray assure him of my earnest wishes for his
happiness, and that The Leasowes will be al∣ways at his service,
whenever, through the fickleness of human nature, he thinks proper to give up
a Muse for a Water-nymph.</P>
<P>I expect Mr. Hylton daily.—He was last week in London, and
is now, I believe, at Coventry.—He will probably visit you before he
comes in∣to this country.—He talked of it when he left me.—I am
obliged to be brief.</P>
<P>Post-woman waits for me, 
<Q REND="inline">"multa gemens."</Q> Dodsley is the man for your
purpose.—He has, with good genius, a liberal turn of mind.—I
ex∣pect him to spend a few days here every week.—I will, if he return
through Warwickshire, occasion him to call upon you; but you know he is
often lame with the gout, and will hardly be able to make any long
digression.</P>
<P>Your case is exactly mine. You say you can∣not bear wrongs with
patience, but you can sleep and <HI>forget</HI> them.—So can I—so
do I.—Did I never tell you (if not, I do so now) that indo∣lence
in a thousand instances, give one all <PB N="187" REF="206"/> the
advantages of philosophy? and pray, if you call me lazy any more, take care
that you do not use an expression by way of disparagement, which I
consider as the highest honour. I am a fool, however, for discovering my
secret. What a number of compliments might you have made me unwittingly!</P>

<HEAD>LXXII. To Mr. JAGO, on their contribution to <HI>Dodsley's</HI>
Miscellanies.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>The Leasowes, 
<DATE>Jan. 22, 1755.</DATE></DATELINE> 
<SALUTE>Dear Mr. Jago,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM sure you must be puzzled how to ac∣count for my silence,
after the honour you have done me by your verses, and the request you made
that I would <HI>write.</HI>—I am also as much at a loss how to give
a proper weight to my apology. To say I have been ill, would per∣haps imply
too much: when I would only al∣lude to that state of heaviness and
dejection which is so frequently my lot at this time of the year; and which
renders me both <HI>averse</HI> to writ∣ing, and utterly dissatisfied
with every thing that I <HI>do</HI> write.</P>
<P><PB N="188" REF="207"/>IF at any time my head grew a little less
con∣fused than ordinary, I was obliged to devote my attention to the affair
in which I had so <HI>foolishly</HI> involved myself with Dodsley. You
are unable to conceive what vexation it has given me: I could not endure to
<HI>disappoint</HI> him: of conse∣quence, it has been my lot to study the
delica∣cies of <HI>poetry</HI> when my brain was not sufficient to indite a
piece of common prose; but as the <HI>Mouse</HI> (by which I mean my
<HI>own</HI> performances) will so soon make its ridiculous appearance, it
were totally impolitic in me to expatiate on the labours of the
<HI>Mountain.</HI>—The first letter I re∣ceived from you left me
greatly dissatisfied. I was then to send D— my <HI>final</HI>
instructions in a post or two.—You took little notice of any query I
made; and intimated a disapprobation which agreed <HI>too well</HI> with my
own internal sen∣timents. I knew not but you were <HI>angry</HI> at the
<HI>liberties</HI> I had taken; though I could have sup∣pressed any
single paper which I had then con∣veyed to London.—Little did I
<HI>then</HI> imagine that it was in my power to have protracted the affair
till <HI>now.</HI> Had that been the case, I should have troubled you with
repeated embassies; for I abhor the tediousness of the post, and my
ser∣vants do little at this time of the year, that is of more importance than
their master's poetry.</P>
<P>Your next letter convinced me, that you had taken no offence: and
so far I was happy; but then I wanted to have your Gold-finches as cor∣rect
as your Black-birds; there were <HI>some</HI> things I wished you to alter;
and others in regard to which I was desirous to speak my
<HI>sentiments.</HI> Add to this my own <HI>verses,</HI> with which I was
in∣finitely <HI>more</HI> dissatisfied. Why then did I not write?—The
true reason was, that I was pressed by D— to send conclusions
every post; and though I have had all this leisure (as it <HI>happens</HI>)
since you wrote, I never could <HI>depend</HI> upon <PB N="189" REF="208"/>
more than the space of a day or two. Besides, criticisms in the way of
letter are extremely te∣dious and dissatisfactory; insomuch, that I am
thoroughly determined never to print any thing for the future, unless I have
the company of my friends when I send to the press Hur∣ried as I then was,
I sent up your two copies, and what I proposed for him of my own, with a
kind of <HI>discretionary</HI> power to select the best readings. How you
would approve of this measure I knew not; but I had this to plead in my
behalf, that D— was a person of taste <HI>himself</HI>; that he
had, as I imagined, many learned friends to assist him; that his
<HI>interest</HI> was concerned in the per∣fection of his Miscellany; and
that I submitted my own pieces to the same judgement.</P>
<P>After all, I am but indifferently satisfied with the present
state of these contributions. D— writes just so much as he deems
<HI>necessary</HI> in the way of business, and passes by a
thousand points in my letters which deserve an answer. His last
acquaints me, that he has spent a whole day in the arrangement of what I have
sent him; and that he purposes to send me <HI>proof-sheets</HI> before
the close of this week, desiring I would send them back by the return of
the post. Whether they arrive on Saturday or on Monday, I can keep them till
the Thursday following.</P>
<P>And this brings me, in the last place, to the main purpose of
this letter.—It is a request on which I lay great stress; and which
you must not refuse me upon almost any consideration.—I beg, in
short, that you would promise me the favour of your company on Monday (or
even Tuesday next, if possible; and let us jointly fix the readings of
<HI>your</HI> pieces, of my <HI>own,</HI> and those of our common
<HI>friends.</HI>—You will immediately comprehend the <HI>expediency</HI>
of this; now, in par∣ticular, that our names are to appear. <HI>Some</HI>
alterations I think <HI>necessary</HI> in your Gold-finches, 
<PB N="190" REF="209"/> and there are two or three stanzas which I think you
might improve.—Nevertheless, I will not pretend that this journey is
so <HI>requisite</HI> upon your <HI>own</HI> account as <HI>mine</HI>; and
will recommend it upon no other footing than the pleasure you will receive by
the obligation which you will confer.</P>
<P>I thought to have concluded here; but, as an envelope is now become
altogether necessary, have a temptation to proceed which I did not see
before.</P>
<P>It is now become Friday the twenty-fourth of January. The packets I
send, and the request that I make upon so <HI>little</HI> warning, will,
at first, astonish you.—Unforeseen interruptions would not
suffer me to dispatch my courier sooner.—What then remains, but
that I endeavour to ad∣just this affair agreeably to its <HI>present</HI>
circum∣stances?</P>
<P>You will readily conceive from what you ob∣serve in my packets,
how desireable your com∣pany is to me at this juncture. Supposing it then
in your <HI>power</HI> to come over on Monday, Tuesday, or even Wednesday,
I am inclined to believe you <HI>will.</HI> Supposing it <HI>not</HI> so, I
can foresee you will not have leisure to satisfy my queries by the return
of the bearer; and what I would <HI>next</HI> propose is, that you would
either suffer me to send again to you betwixt this time and Thursday
next; or that you would yourself dispatch a purpose-messenger, and
allow me to pay for his journey.—In either of these <HI>latter</HI>
cases, I am sure you so well know the nature of my present
irresolution, that you will endeavour to afford me all the assistance
you are able.</P>
<P>Adieu! my dear friend! and depend upon my best services on every
possible occasion.</P>

<HEAD>LXXXIII. To the same, on the same Subject.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>The Leasows, 
<DATE>Feb. 22, 1755.</DATE></DATELINE> 
<SALUTE>Dear Mr. Jago,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I RECEIVED a letter from Dodsley, dated the fifteenth of February;
informing me that you were then in town, had been with him, and left your
directions whether he might send you a set of Miscellanies.</P>
<P>February the twentieth, and not <HI>before,</HI> arrived young
H— with your letter; very obliging∣ly intended to give me previous notice
of your journey; but which, by the iniquity of chance, tended only to acquaint
me with an opportunity which I had <HI>lost.</HI></P>
<P>There is nothing could have been so fortunate as your journey to
London, had Mr. H— thought proper to bring your letter in due
time.—What excuse he made for his neglect, or whether he made any, I
have really forgot. This I know, that the whole affair has been unlucky. There
has been abundant time for consultation, and a perfect series of
opportunities of which we have not been suffered to avail
ourselves.—It is now three weeks or a month since I corrected the
proof-sheets; was so hurried in the doing of it that I scarce knew what I
wrote; and yet, in spite of all this hurry, the book is hitherto
un∣published. <HI>Now,</HI> indeed, it must be much too late for
alterations, as D— has given me some room to expect a book this very
day.—I know but little what he has done in consequence of that
discretionary power with which I, through haste, was obliged to intrust
him: but in what I have done, <HI>myself,</HI> you may expect to find all the
effects of <HI>dulness precipitated.</HI></P>
<P>It is now the twenty-third of February, and I have received no
fresh account of our friend <PB N="192" REF="211"/> Dodsley's proceedings;
nor am I able to <HI>trace</HI> them, as I expected, in the news-papers.</P>
<P>As to your share of this Miscellany, you can have no cause to
be dissatisfied.—After what manner he has thought proper to print
Lady L—'s verses, I am a good deal uncertain; but I apprehend he has
not followed her own read∣ings very precisely, and that the blame thereof is
to be thrown upon me.—I am concerned for the memory of my poor friend
Whistler; and regret that his <HI>better</HI> pieces did not fall into my
hands. I think that Dodsley, however, would have done him greater justice,
had he inserted his translation of 
<Q REND="inline">"Horace and Lydia."</Q> It is true, the
translations of that Ode are out of num∣ber; but <HI>his,</HI> if I mistake
not, had many beau∣ties of its own.—I do not know whether I ever hinted
to you, that <HI>his</HI> genius and that of Ovid were apparently
congenial.—Had he cultivated his with equal care, perhaps the
similitude had been as obvious as that of your twin-daughters.—Mr.
Graves has one small well-polished gem in this collection; his verses
upon medals.—His little conjugal Love-song is also natural and
easy.—I <HI>told</HI> you what I least disliked of my <HI>own</HI>
puerilities.—If the printing of my Rural Inscrip∣tions be
<HI>invidious,</HI> it was altogether owing to the instigation of Sir
G— L—. There are four or five little matters, which, if he have
printed with my name, incorrect as they are, I shall be utterly
disconsolate; at least, till I get sight of a succeeding
impression.—For though I am not much solicitous about a poetical
reputation (and indeed it is of little importance to so <HI>domestic</HI>
an animal as myself), yet I could ill endure to pass for an affected,
powerless <HI>pretender.</HI></P>
<P>And now no more upon the subject.—I have nothing to add that
can the least amuse you.—You, who have been conversant with all the
busy and the splendid scenes of life, can want <PB N="193" REF="212"/> no
materials to make a letter entertaining.—In∣deed you never
<HI>did.</HI>—I shall be glad, however, to receive a <HI>long</HI> one,
upon what subjects you please.</P>
<P>I have passed a very dull and unamusive win∣ter; my health
indeed rather better than I experi∣enced it last year; but my head
<HI>as</HI> confused, and my spirits <HI>as</HI> low. I live in hopes of an
opportunity of seeing you at Harbury; but I begin now to re∣ceive visits as
an honest beggar does an alms, with my humblest thanks for the favour, and
with a despair of making a return.</P>
<P>Perhaps my next letter may discover some∣what more
<HI>resolution:</HI> inclinations I never want; being at all times with
singular affection yours.</P>

<SALUTE>Dear Mr. Jago,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE so long expected the favour of a few lines from you, that I
begin at last to question whether you received the letter I sent you. It
was inclosed in one to Mr. M—, whom I requested to further it with
all conve∣nient expedition. I am neither able to recollect the whole contents
of it; nor indeed, if I <HI>were,</HI> could I endure the thoughts of
transcribing them. The chief intention of it, however, was to ac∣quaint you
of Mr. H—'s unhappy delay in the delivery of that letter with which you
favoured me from Radway.</P>
<P>What confirms me in a suspicion that my last letter
miscarried, is, that Mr. Wren lately ac∣quainted me of your being at Wroxall
upon bu∣siness, and of your making some slight mention 
<PB N="192" REF="213"/> <GAP DESC="duplicate" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/> 
<PB N="193" REF="214"/> <GAP DESC="duplicate" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/> 
<PB N="194" REF="215"/> of Mr. Dodsley's publication, without intimat∣ing that
you discovered any design you had of writing to me. This is mere preamble
and stuff: implying nothing more than the desire I have to <HI>hear</HI>
from you, when it ought also to express how impatiently I long to
<HI>see</HI> you. Worldly concerns and my winterly state of health have
detained me at home for these many months past; world∣ly concerns may have
confined you likewise; but as your health and spirits are universally
better than mine, and as you have much less dislike to travelling than
myself, I would hope that my absence from Harbury will never cause you to
<HI>neglect</HI> any <HI>opportunity</HI> of coming hither. For my own part, I
have been meditating upon a visit to you all this winter; and do, at this
time, resolve most strenuously to perform it before June. But the many
such schemes of pleasure in which I have been disappointed are a sort
of check upon my expressions, and make me pro∣mise with <HI>fear.</HI> As
to Dodsley's performance, which you must have received before this time, I
will make no observations till I have the plea∣sure of seeing you: and
yet there are many points I would discuss, and many accounts I want to give
you. So many indeed, that they would furnish out perhaps a superficial
drawling letter; but would serve infinitely better for conversation, with
the book before us. The volume, I am told, is well received in town; though
political intelligence must engross much of its present attention.</P>
<P>Mr. Hylton is in my neighbourhood, and upon the point of settling
at his farm. Could you possibly spend a week with us, we would try to
make it agreeable. At all events, I beg to hear from you; and that, not merely
as it will afford me great pleasure, but as, at the same time, it will
ease me of some solicitude. I will not make this a long letter, though I
wish to receive a long <PB N="195" REF="216"/> one in return; having a head
very little quali∣fied to add any thing that may amuse you, though a heart
very sincerely and affectionately at your service.</P>

<SALUTE>Dear Mr. Jago,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THOUGH the silence that has prevailed for so long a time betwixt
us be. I fear, to be placed to <HI>my</HI> account, yet do I by no means
imagine, that you will desire me to fill half this letter with apologies.
Suffice it, that I owe all the world, at this time, either letters, visits,
or money: yet that my <HI>heart</HI> is as well disposed in each of these
respects, as that of any one per∣son who is insolvent. The regard indeed
that I owe to you has been a troublesome inmate with∣in my bosom for some
time past; making daily remonstrances against the injustice which I
have done it; and urging me strenuously to take horse, and make my
<HI>personal</HI> apologies at Har∣bury.—I return you many thanks for
Mr. S—'s company, and for the sight of the ma∣nuscript which he
shewed me. Alas! that I cannot spare money to drain and to improve my
lands, or to put almost any part of his excel∣lent rules in execution! and
yet that Mr. Childe of Kinlett (hearing my place always termed a farm) should
come expecting to find all things managed here according to the perfection of
<HI>husbandry!</HI> As little <HI>can</HI> I pretend to improve Mr.
S—'s treatise, as his treatise <HI>will</HI> my farm: no farther at
<HI>most,</HI> than in what regards the <HI>stile,</HI> or <HI>plan</HI> of
his performance. Yet could I wish <PB N="196" REF="217"/> to see both
<HI>it</HI> and <HI>him</HI> again before he prints it; wishing him all the
success which his very <HI>en∣deavour</HI> deserves. Assuredly the
present is not the <HI>time</HI> for his publication: more <HI>immediate</HI>
re∣medies than can be derived from agriculture are become absolutely
requisite to relieve the sufferings of this nation.—I should be
extremely well-pleased to visit you at Harbury, but cannot even propose
to myself that happiness at <HI>present</HI>; and were I even to
<HI>promise,</HI> have but too much reason to know the <HI>uncertainty</HI>
of my <HI>performance.</HI> Yet am I sensible enough we <HI>ought to
meet,</HI> if we purpose that what we print should have the ad∣vantage of
our mutual criticisms. Let me then <HI>conjure</HI> you to come over, at your
convenience, for a few days, that we may agree at least upon some
<HI>general</HI> points, and make no worse a figure in the future
Miscellany, than we have done in the foregoing<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See
the Edinburgh Review, No. 1.</NOTE>.—But I have really more things to
<HI>say</HI> than I will pretend to <HI>scrawl</HI> upon <HI>paper</HI>;
nor can I endure to retail a few particulars, while I am impatient to
communicate the whole.</P>
<P>Let me acquaint you while I remember, that there is at this time a
Mr. Duncombe and his son, clergymen, that are publishing a new
trans∣lation of Horace. Whatever you may think of their <HI>success,</HI>
after <HI>Francis,</HI> I believe I may pro∣nounce them men of real merit, and
in no wise destitute of learning or genius. They have re∣quested me to
communicate any <HI>version</HI> or <HI>imita∣tion</HI> that I can furnish,
either of my own or of any friends; wherefore, it you <HI>have</HI> any thing
of this fort, I should be glad if you would put it in my power to oblige
them. The son has an 
<Q REND="inline">"Ode to Health"</Q> in the fourth volume of
Dodsley's Miscellany.</P>
<P>Under the head of intelligence, I have mighty little to
convey.—The house at Hagley, is, in a manner, finished, so far as
concerns the shell; <PB N="197" REF="218"/> and wants nothing, besides a
portico to be as compleat as most in England.—pray remember me to Mr.
Talbot, Mr. Miller, and Mr. Hol∣beach; should they call upon me next year,
they will find my place better worth their no∣tice.</P>

<SALUTE>Dear Mr. Graves,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU will be harrassed with my letters till you condemn my
excessive leisure as loud∣l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
as I have lamented that you should ever feel the <HI>want</HI> of it. Nor is

long <HI>silence.</HI> Yet the partiality which you have ever shewn me
will, I think, dispose you to receive my let∣ters more patiently than it is
in my power to sus∣tain the loss of <HI>yours.</HI> After all, I should
not write at present, but that the Miscellanies, with which Dodsley
compliments us, arrived last week at the Leasowes. I desire therefore you
would acquaint me, whether the fe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t
that he means for you should remain here till your arri∣val; or if you
chuse that I should send it by the Birmingham-stage to Bath. Having
made this enquiry, I was thinking to conclude; but cannot reconcile myself to
the <HI>novelty</HI> of sending <HI>you</HI> three empty pages. The
Parliament will <PB N="198" REF="219"/> rise too soon for the publication of
my 
<Q REND="inline">"Rural Elegance;"</Q> and having performed my
promise to Dodsley, I think no more about such <HI>laurels</HI> as the
<HI>public</HI> can bestow upon me, but am giving all my attention to such
as I can purchase of my nursery-man. I wish, however, that the vo∣lume
may recompense Dodsley for his trouble: I may also add, for his
ingenuity, and for his politeness in giving each of us a compleat sett.
They are elegantly bound, and all as much alike as possible.</P>
<P>The present crisis of state-affairs does not seem to favour
his publication, as the attention of the public must lean greatly to that
quarter. I saw a letter from Sir William M— (who corres∣ponds with
Lady Luxborough) which placed the struggles of the ministry in a clearer
light than they had yet appeared to me. It seems that persons of all
denominations are for carry∣ing on the war with vigour; and the King's
ap∣plication for a Vote of Credit was received with general approbation. The
zeal of the Parlia∣ment was indeed so remarkable on this occasion, that,
instead of the 600,000<HI>l.</HI> at first intended, it was thought proper
to propose a million. But the services were ascertained, and the
Chan∣cellor of the Exchequer made accountable for the application of it. The
augmentation of the fleet with 20,000 seamen; the raising 5000 ma∣rines on
a plan of dividing them into small com∣panies, which will render them more
useful both by sea and land; the completion and re∣inforcement of the
Irish regiments; are the uses to which this million is to be appropriated.
Mr. Fox and his land-war party sat mute, whilst Mr. Legge with great
openness and per∣spicuity explained the present schemes; as they were
calculated, to exert our whole strength at sea, and, if possible, no
where else. Mr. Dod∣ington, who, it seems, has not spoke for many years,
charmed every body. His wit did not <PB N="199" REF="220"/> only entertain, but
animate and affect his hear∣ers. 
<Q REND="inline">"It were better, <HI>he said,</HI> than lose the
domini∣on of the Ocean, that the Ocean should overwhelm us: for what Briton
could wish to leave a posterity crawling upon this island, only to feel
the tyranny, and swell the victories, of France?"</Q> It seems, F—,
in his opposition to the Duke of New∣castle, is supported by the Duke of
Cumber∣land, his army, and the Scotch: that the minis∣try (or the D. of
N—'s party) seem not displeas∣ed with a prospect of uniting with
the Tories, who now hold the balance; and it seems the Tories, by Sir
William's letter, are as little dis∣pleased to unite with the
Ministry.</P>
<P>You will guess that good part of this political account is
<HI>transcribed</HI>; and you will guess aright. I had some thoughts that
it might amuse you, and had no occasion to use other
expressions.—Let me now, once more, return to the futile ob∣jects of
my <HI>own</HI> amusement. The impression upon this letter will be taken
from my new seal. The motto that I have pitched upon is, SUPER∣EST MEMORIA:
though I yet retain some hank∣ering after the single word PRAETERITIS.
Pro∣bably this, however, is not the last seal that I shall cause this
man to cut in steel. The altar is not yet finished: ANTE OMNIA MUSAE; but
it does not quite satisfy me.—I will inclose the two last letters I
received from Mr. Dodsley; but you must not think I build too much upon any
compli∣ment which he there makes me.—It is true, I think him a very
sincere man; but he cannot have been conversant so long with

<P>IT were needless for me to recommend to you a person whom you
so truly esteem as Mr. Dodsley; and from whom you will gladly receive a
visit, not more upon <HI>my</HI> account, than upon <HI>his</HI> and your

time at Bath, you will be acquainted with him at first sight; which, I
think, should ever be a maxim with persons of genius and humanity.—He
has made a few days extremely agreeable to me at The Leasowes; has been
shewing me his new Tragedy, which I wished you also might peruse. If I
be not un∣accountably imposed upon by my friendship for the writer, the
extraordinary merit of this per∣formance is altogether
unquestionable.—I will not inform you through what hands it has
passed in town; because I would have you communi∣cate your sentiments
to him with entire freedom, being assured the delicacy of them may
<HI>yet</HI> be of service, and that the openness with which you
communicate them will be infinitely pleasing to Mr. Dodsley. He has done me
the honour to ask me for an epilogue:—I <HI>wish,</HI> but
<HI>fear</HI> to un∣dertake it.—Should any lucky hint occur to 
<PB N="201" REF="222"/> <HI>you,</HI> I well know how much you are able to

first opportunity.—What talk I of a line from you, who am, at this very

Works.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>The Leasowes, 
<DATE>Mar. 7, 1757.</DATE></DATELINE> 
<SALUTE>Dear Mr. Graves,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE passed a very dull and unamusive winter here—the
worse, for being neither <HI>disposed</HI> nor <HI>qualified</HI> to keep
up a correspondence with my friends; with <HI>you,</HI> among the
<HI>chief</HI>; and yet, it is upon you that I must depend to make up my
deficiencies with Mr. Dodsley.—The poor man has been afflicted with the
most <HI>lasting</HI> fit of the gout he ever underwent before.—His
patience, on these occasions, is inimita∣ble. His excursion to the
<HI>Regions of Terror and Pity</HI> is not the only instance of his ability
to compose verses in the midst of pain. When he sent me a copy of it,
he let me know, that he had transmitted another to you by the same post.
I should be glad to receive your remarks upon it, ere I communicate my own. I
have, for <PB N="202" REF="223"/> some weeks past, sound my head so
terribly confused, that it has been with difficulty I could <HI>think</HI> or
<HI>express</HI> myself on the most superficial to∣pic. I hope, in a
little time, to be able to exa∣mine it more attentively than I can at
present: yet, in the mean while, must acknowledge, that I think his
subject capable of furnishing extraor∣dinary beauties for an Ode: and
<HI>such,</HI> I think, he should <HI>call</HI> it; dropping the narrative
parts, and the connexions as much as possible. I can∣not wish him to
print it without very <HI>material</HI> al∣terations; and what would occasion
almost the same trouble as it would require to <HI>new-write</HI> it. I do
not mean this as a condemnation of what he has already done; so much, as a
proof of my opinion how much he will he able to improve it. <HI>After all,</HI>
it will scarce affect me half so so much as his Tragedy. He is so
<HI>honest</HI> a man, that the work he has to give the world is much better
than the specimen: or to borrow an idea from <HI>my situation,</HI> the
grain that he has to deliver will prove much better than the sample. It is
with shame I acknowledge I have not yet sent him his epilogue; and I feel
the greater com∣punction of mind upon this score, as it is possible he
may impute my neglect to Garrick's refusal of his play. This weighs nothing
with you or me; a thousand motives may affect a manager, that have little or
nothing to do with the merit of the performance; yet he may so far thank Mr.
Garrick, that whatever his refusal takes from the <HI>reputation</HI> of his
Tragedy, it will, through Dodsley's industry, add apparently to its value.
I have not yet been able to satisfy myself with every part of your
epilogue, and must either omit sending it at present, or must send
him an imperfect copy. If you write to him, let me beg you to give the most
favourable account you <HI>can</HI> of me.</P>
<P><PB N="203" REF="224"/>Somebody acquainted me (I think it was Mr.
Talbot,) that your old friend Ballard had be∣queathed you his coins for a
legacy. I was truly glad to hear it; but have wondered since, that you never
once informed me of so considerable an acquisition.</P>
<P>I remember a poem of yours, called —, upon the present
taste in gardening; which you will not wonder if my late, employments make me
wish once more to see. Be so kind as to send me a copy of this, as well
as of any other little pieces that you have in your bureau. Some of yours
deserve a better place than what is assigned them in the Magazine. In
particular, I remem∣ber that upon Enigmas, and Mopsy. Be assured, I will
make no <HI>use</HI> of <HI>any</HI> without your previous consent. You
know, I suppose, that Dodsley's other Miscellanies do not appear before
next winter.—I have received from him, together with his Ode, a few
Elegies published by Mr. Whitehead. They are, I think, worth your perusal;
and designed by my worthy friend to excite my emulation. Alas! that I am so
ill able to deserve the encouragements which I re∣ceive from him!</P>
<P>My neighbour Baskerville, at the close of this month publishes
his fine edition of Virgil. It will, for <HI>type</HI> and <HI>paper,</HI> be a
perfect curiosity. He follows the Cambridge edition.</P>
<P>What think you of their management in re∣gard to Mr. Byng? I cannot
help thinking the King should <HI>pardon</HI> him. The Court-martial, by
acquitting him of cowardice or disaffection, have left no <HI>motive</HI> for
his <HI>negligence,</HI> beside an <HI>error of his judgement;</HI> for we
<HI>cannot</HI> impute it to <HI>supineness, indifference,</HI> or
<HI>inattention.</HI> And then to sentence a man for error, is to expect
infalli∣bility. That twelfth article of war is most un∣doubtedly
ill-expressed.—Pray do not forget my <PB N="204" REF="225"/> best

<SALUTE>Dear Mr. Graves,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHAT remarks I had to make upon our friend Dodsley's Ode, I sent
him the last post. I would gladly have occasioned them to pass by
Claverton; but, having delayed them so long, I was impatient to convince him
that I had not <HI>wholly</HI> disregarded his request. They are indeed
pretty copious; and yet I have reserved to myself the privilege of
re-criticising when I see his altered copy. I recommended to him the
addition which you proposed, and some others; and if he will but take the
pains that I have chalked out for him, I doubt not that he will render it an
excellent Ode, though he may not find it a very <HI>popular</HI> one. I have
also sent him a copy of our epilogue, not much different from what you
saw; to these I added my little Ode on Lady Luxborough's furnishing her
libra∣ry, and Perry's Verses upon the Malvern-waters. At the close of
these last, there appears (with Perry's approbation,) a short address
to Dr. Wall of Worcester; a very eminent physician, and the patron of this
mineral, who has pro∣moted a subscription in the county towards
<HI>building,</HI> near this well, for the accommodation of strangers.</P>
<P>I purpose also to give Dodsley the little Ode I inclose, and
would beg the favour of you to <PB N="205" REF="226"/> advise me concerning
the additional stanzas' fix the readings in the rest, and to return me the
copy.</P>
<P>I come now to analyze your remark on Bal∣lard's legacy; which is
indeed very ingenious, but will scarce bear examination: nor do I think that
you rather wish to have <HI>found</HI> that set of medals, than to have
them <HI>given</HI> you by a de∣ceased friend. Assuredly, if we do not
allow pleasure to be <HI>predominant</HI> in this kind of melan∣choly, we
destroy the foundation of all tragic or elegiac writings. Melpomene has no
place amongst the Muses; and the pains that we have taken with our friend
Dodsley's pensive Ode have been employed to no purpose. But you want not
these pedantic flourishes, and are wholly of my mind.</P>
<P>Martin's Magazine is, I believe, pretty ob∣scure; and I wonder
where you got a sight of it. It was, however, fortunate enough for
<HI>me</HI> that you gave no copy of 
<Q REND="inline">"James Dawson."</Q> I ne∣ver yet saw your
verses <HI>on that Grotto,</HI> or from <HI>Phaedrus,</HI> and I want to
see your W— once more, concerning which you are silent. Your

<Q REND="inline">"Mopsy"</Q> might, I think, ap∣pear in Dodsley's
Miscellany, either <HI>with</HI> or <HI>without</HI> your name. I also want
a copy of your verses upon Riddles; and whenever you have a leisure hour,
should be glad if you would look them out and send them.</P>
<P>Go, and think yourself an happy man; at least, if your children
be recovered, as I am in∣clined to think they are; and give my service to
Mrs. Graves, for the happiness that she occasions you; of which I cannot
but partake, being, with constant and sincere affection, your most

<SALUTE>Dear Mr. Graves,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>DO you know my hand-writing?—It is real∣ly such a length of
time since you had de∣mands upon me for letters, that I am hardly able to
enumerate the several causes of my neg∣lect. <HI>This</HI> I know, that
scarce a day has passed, during this interval of silence, in which I
have not <HI>remembered</HI> you with the most affectionate esteem.—I
<HI>hope</HI> you correspond with our friend Dodsley; and that it is not
altogether disagreea∣able to you, to find he is printing some of your
verses. He has many, alas! <HI>too</HI> many, of mine; which I suffered him
to take away in summer, and which the state of my winter health and
spi∣rits renders me but ill able to revise. I believe, I am, even now, the
principal cause that his two volumes remain yet unpublished; nor can I
ex∣press the pain it gives me, to be thus detrimental to his interests; and
to delay the publication of so much better pieces than my own. I am also
dissatisfied upon <HI>another score;</HI> I mean, that I have been
wanting to myself, in not asking the benefit of your advice; which I have
heretofore experienced to be at once so <HI>comfortable</HI> and so
<HI>ad∣vantageous</HI>; but although the scheme was project∣ed in summer,
the business of correction was (by <HI>me</HI> at least) deferred till
winter, and then I had neither spirits to <HI>correct</HI> or to
<HI>correspond.</HI></P>
<P>I am really as much obliged to you for the pains which you took on
my behalf in London, as though the <HI>subject</HI> of your enquiry were a
thing of more <HI>importance</HI> to me; but, indeed, you can hardly conceive
how indifferent I am now grown, not only as to articles of <HI>that
sort,</HI> but to aught that regards external splendour.</P>
<P><PB N="207" REF="228"/>I really have not time to enter upon the
me∣rits of inoculation; but am very sure that Mrs. G—'s danger was
enough to influence <HI>your</HI> de∣termination. I am heartily glad to hear of
her recovery; and can but look upon the weeks which I purpose to pass
some time hereafter with you at Claverton, as the most agreeable of any
that belong to the remainder of my life. I I am sensible, that if I
<HI>coveted</HI> to <HI>shine</HI> in poetry, I should lose no time in
visiting public places; but my wishes of that sort are most extremely
li∣mited; and I shall visit <HI>you</HI> on the account of
<HI>friendship</HI>; that is (past all doubt,) on a much <HI>better
principle.</HI></P>
<P>I have <HI>long</HI> meant to write to you, and have accordingly
given <HI>some</HI> answer to most parts of your last letter.
Nevertheless, the occasion of this present letter is quite of another
kind.—A young painter of my acquaintance is advised to to go to Bath;
has a recommendation to the Bishop of B—, who will introduce him to the
Duke of N—. And though I cannot so easily bring him acquainted with
nobles or prime-mi∣nisters, I can give him directions to my friend, who, in
point of taste, is their superior. The person then, who, I suppose,
will be the bearer of this letter, has, by dint of mere ingenu∣ity, risen to
a considerable eminence in fruit-pieces, &amp;c. He has been employed by Lord
Lyttelton, and is much admired at Oxford; for my own part, I believe you will
think he is in few respects inferior to, and has (if I am not mistaken)
some advantages of, Stranover; but you will see his pieces. All I have to
say fur∣ther on the occasion is, that he is a native of our parish, and a
particular friend of <HI>mine;</HI> and if it were in your power to promote his
interest at Bath, you would not only highly gratify me; but at the same
time do a service to one of the least assuming, most ingenious, and
most amia∣ble <PB N="208" REF="229"/> men I know.—I beg my best

<SALUTE>Dear Mr. Graves,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I THANK God, I have recovered a tolera∣ble degree of health this
spring; though by no means free from so much heaviness and lassitude,
as renders me averse to all activity of body and mind. In the course of my
disorder, so long as I could bear to think of <HI>any</HI> sublunary
enjoyment, I remembered my friends, and of course thought much of
<HI>you</HI>; but its advances were so precipi∣tate, when I sent for the
physicians, that I soon received a <HI>wrench</HI> from every object of
this world; and it was by slow degrees, even after my recovery, that my mind
took so much root again, as appears necessary for its immediate
sup∣port. I suppose you have been informed that my fever was in great
measure hypochondriacal; and left my nerves so extremely sensible,
that, even on no very interesting subject, I could readily think myself
into a vertigo: I had almost said an epilepsy; for surely I was
oftentimes near it.—It became, therefore, expedient for my recovery, to
amuse myself with a succession of the most trivial objects I could
find; and this kind of carelessness I have indulged till it is grown into
an habit. Even letters to my friends are hardly consistent with my rule of
health; <PB N="209" REF="230"/> yet I could be no longer silent with regard to
<HI>you,</HI> without feeling a sensation that would hurt me <HI>more.</HI>
This may fairly enough be termed the first <HI>letter</HI> I have wrote
since my recovery; wherein if I should tell you one half that I am inclined
to do, relating to this dreadful illness, what room should I then leave to
speak on any other subject? I must, therefore, tell these things by
word of mouth, or write them some other time. The journies which my friends,
and in∣deed physicians, propose for me, are what cer∣tainly bid fairest
for the completion of my cure: yet there are many, many things, which how∣ever
unfit for the task, I must endeavour to ad∣just before I can leave home,
with any possibili∣ty of enjoyment. Need I mention any other than my
cursed embarrassment with D—? who, during my <HI>danger,</HI> was
induced to stop proceed∣ings; but is now beginning law afresh, and, by the
removal of tenants from <HI>his</HI> share of the Harborough estate, has
now wriggled himself into possession of almost one half of
<HI>mine.</HI> However, I am not without hopes of seeing all terminated in a
little time; nor entirely without a prospect of seeing you at Claverton
this sum∣mer. That you may think this the more pro∣bable, I am pressed by
two young gentlemen, whom I very much esteem to accompany them on a visit
to Mr. Bamfylde in Somersetshire. These two gentlemen are Mr. Dean and
Mr. Knight. Perhaps you may have heard of Mr. Bamfylde, who is very much at
Bath; is there now with his lady, or has left the place but lately; and whose
fortune, person, figure, and accomplishments, can hardly leave him long
un∣noticed in any place where he resides. Yet my visit to Estercomb
must be of secondary conse∣quence to me, whilst you live by the
road-side. I am much obliged to you for your compliment on my Poematia in
Dodsley's Miscellanies; <PB N="210" REF="231"/> which came very
seasonably, considering how I had been mortified by the first sight
of what was done. To speak the truth, there are many things appear there very
contrary to my intenti∣ons; but which I am more desirous may be at∣tributed
to the unseasonableness of my fever, than to my friend D—'s
precipitation. My purpose was to acknowledge as <HI>mine,</HI> none of the
pieces which now follow the longer Ode to La∣dy Luxborough. Her name was
actually erased; as also my own at the close of your Fable. The verses
by Mrs. Bennet to Mr. Richardson were absolutely new to me; were my name
occurs again. All this is against me; as a thing in itself invidious to
have one's name recur so often, and as my <HI>own lines contradict</HI> the
merit which my friends so liberally allow me.—The verses of mine in
the sixth volume (which was printed be∣fore the fifth) were printed without
my know∣ledge; and when I sent up an improved copy, it arrived a good deal
too late. As things hap∣pen, I am made to own several things of inferior
merit to those which I <HI>do not</HI> own—All this is against me;
but my thoughts are avocated from this edition, and wholly fixed upon a future;
wherein, I hope, Dodsley will be prevailed upon to omit some things also
from <HI>other</HI> hands which discredit his collection: and, to balance
<HI>all my discomforts</HI> on this head, the world will know that I am
esteemed by a person, whom I esteem so much as you.—I know not
how it happens, but the taste for humorous poetry does not prevail at this
time: yet I cannot agree with Mr. J. Warton, that it is no poetry <HI>at
all,</HI> any more than that a good representation of Dutch boors is not a
picture.—His brother, the Pro∣fessor, is to be here with his pupil
Lord Done∣gal, &amp;c. this summer.—Mr. Spence and Mr. Dodsley will
stay a day or two here this month in their way to Scotland; and Mr. Home, the
<PB N="211" REF="232"/> author of Douglas, &amp;c. called on me and we spent
an evening together at Admiral Smith's. Thus my <HI>ferme ornée</HI>
procures me interviews with persons whom it might otherwise be my
<HI>wish,</HI> rather than my good fortune to see. Would to God, it could
attract <HI>you,</HI> whom I more long to see than any one! and let me tell
you, there were considerable additions made to it last year: Dodsley's
present of Faunus; a new Gothic-building, or rather a skreen, which cost
ten pounds; and the ruins of a Priory, which, however, make a tenant's house,
that pays me tolerable poundage.—I am growing a little into <HI>your</HI>
taste, why should not you ad∣vance farther into <HI>mine?</HI> I mean, I
have a love for medals, by means of some that have been given me: yet do not
think that I shall ever ri∣val. <HI>you.</HI>—My object is only
<HI>beauty,</HI> and I love only those of exquisite workmanship: so
that this is no more a rivalship than that of two per∣sons who admire the
sex, but love different individuals; a rivalship, which, I trust, is more
likely to cement our friendship than disunite us; which it is my
<HI>conviction</HI> and my <HI>comfort</HI> no <HI>sort</HI> of rivalship
will ever do. I have hardly room to express my good wishes for long health
and happiness to Mrs. Graves and your little family, and to subscribe
myself, my dear friend,</P>

<P>Mr. Dodsley and Mr. Spence have been here and stayed a week with

<SALUTE>Dear Mr. Graves,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE had daily expectations of a line from you these two months;
conscious, how∣ever, that I did not deserve any; and affording a manifest
instance of of the infatuations of self-love. The last letter that I
received of yours is dated the close of July, since which time I have been
chiefly engaged in my customary amuse∣ments; embellishing my farm, and
receiving the company that came to see it. My principal
<HI>ex∣cursions</HI> have been to Enville, on Lord Grey's birth-day; to Lord
Ward's, upon another invi∣tation; and to the Worcester Music-meeting. I
need not mention what an appearance there was of company at Worcester;
dazzling enough, you may suppose, to a person who, like me, has not
seen a public place these ten years. Yet I made a shift to enjoy the
splendour, as well as <PB N="214" REF="235"/> the music that was prepared
for us. I presume, nothing in the way of harmony can passibly go further
than the Oratoria of The Messiah. It seems the best composer's best
composition. Yet I fancied I could observe <HI>some parts</HI> in it,
where∣in Handel's judgment failed him; where the music was not equal, or was
even <HI>opposite,</HI> to what the words required. Very many of the
noblesse, whom I had seen at The Leasowes, were as complaisant to me
as possible; whereas it was my <HI>former</HI> fate, in public places, to
be as little regarded as a journeyman shoe-maker.—There I first saw
our present Bishop; also our late Bishop's monument, which is
fine.—Lastly, there I first saw my Lady Coventry; to whom, I
believe, one must allow all that the world al∣lows in point of
beauty.—She is certainly the most <HI>unexceptionable</HI> figure of a
woman I ever saw; and made most of the ladies there seem of almost
another <HI>species.</HI> On the whole, I was not a little pleased that I
had made this excur∣sion; and returned with double relish to the
<HI>en∣joyment</HI> of my <HI>farm.</HI> It is now high time to take some
notice of your obliging letter.—I think I was not told the purport of the
journey you made to London; so can only say, I am very sorry for the
aggravating circumstances of your disap∣pointment; and hope, long before
this time, that Mrs. Graves is quite recovered.—Did I for∣get to make
your excuses to Dodsley or no?—he was here (as I remember) soon
after, with Mr. Spence, in their way to Scotland.—Mr. Spence, the man
<HI>you</HI> would like, and who would like <HI>you</HI> of all mankind. He
took my Elegies into Scot∣land, and sent them back on his return, with a
sheet or two of criticisms, and an handsome let∣ter.—How much am I
interested in the preser∣vation of his friendship;—and yet such
is my <HI>destiny</HI> (for I can give it no other name.) I have never wrote
to him <HI>since.</HI> This <HI>impartiality</HI> of <PB N="215" REF="236"/>
my neglect, you must accept <HI>yourself</HI> as <HI>some</HI> apo∣logy:

<P>I absolutely <HI>forgot</HI> to talk to Dodsley about your
—, and I am vexed; because I could, with a safe conscience, have
raised his idea of your abilities.—However, it is not too late, even if
you care to publish it this winter—His play comes on (I fancy, <HI>this
very night</HI>) at Co∣vent-garden. What he says in behalf of this step is,
that there was no glimpse of probability, that Garrick would ever admit it at
the other house<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">He says, the players liked
it, and seemed inclined to take
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></NOTE>.—Mrs. Bellamy is
his Cleone, and speaks the epilogue, of which more anon. I suppose he
acts by Lord Chesterfield's opinion: for I know, when he was going to print
it (since he came home) with a <HI>proper</HI> dedication to Mr. Garrick, my
Lord then prevented him, telling him, it <HI>would</HI> be acted one day or
other.—Did I ever send you a copy of the epilogue, with all the
additions and alterations? Dods∣ley first liked, then disliked it, and
lastly liked it again; only desiring me to soften the satire, shorten
the whole (for it was upwards of sixty lines,) and add a complimentary
close to the <HI>boxes.</HI>—All this I have endeavoured, and sent it
him last Monday.—<HI>You</HI> would not care to own it: and he would
fain have <HI>me</HI>; but I think <PB N="216" REF="237"/> neither of us
should run the risque, where so little honour is to be acquired; yet Mr.
Mel∣moth's name to the prologue is an inducement.—I was very near
surprizing you at Claverton this autumn, with my friend young Knight, in his
way to Mr. Bamfylde's; but he goes <HI>again</HI> in spring, and I shall
certainly accompany him; I have <HI>bespoke,</HI> but not yet
<HI>procured</HI> any, horses for my chaise. It is a neat one, you will
find; and I have made two or three excursions in it.—I saw Mr.
Patchen's Topographical Letters soon after they were published.—It
you continue to me the honour of a shield in your Gothic al∣cove, the field
should be either 
<Q REND="inline">"Or, three King-fishers proper,"</Q> or with the
addition of a chief gules, three trefoils argent—no bar, cheve∣ron bend,
&amp;c.—More of this when I write again.—Motto FLVMNINA AMEM,
SYLVASQUE IN∣GLORIVS—RVRA MIHI.</P>
<P>I cannot recollect my company of the season, to tell it
you.—Sir Francis Dashwood, Lord Litchfield, and Mr. Sheldon, were here
together in the beginning of the autumn; and I have strong invitations to
visit them.—I have a very genteel letter from Sir Francis, offering me
gold∣fishes; and I have a double inducement to visit Mr. Sheldon, as he
lives near Mickleton, and is the most agreeable man alive.—Your
acquaint∣ance Lord W— dined and spent good part of a day with
me.—Under a sort of gloomy appear∣ance, a man of admirable sense
and some hu∣mour.—I put him in mind of you, and the re∣markable
monument at Cambden.—Mr. Thomas Warton was also here with Lord Donegal,
and has since sent me his 
<Q REND="inline">"Inscriptions,"</Q> which are rather too simple,
even for my taste.—Bishop of Worcester with his family and
company—Lord Willoughby—Lord Foley.—I mention Lord Fo∣ley the
rather, because I shall call on your friend Dr. Charleton (who was also
here) to pass a <PB N="217" REF="238"/> day or two with me at Whitley.—I
shall pass also a day or two at our Bishop's, whom I met since at
Enville. These two (<HI>propose</HI> what I <HI>will</HI> besides) will
probably be the principal, or only excur∣sions that I shall make this
winter.—God send it may no more affect my health than it has hither∣to
done.—I am at present tolerably well, and live more temperately than
before.—Would to God you could come over; go with me to Dr. Charleton's,
and Lord Foley's, and Lord Stam∣ford's, and pass a week here! I would meet
you with my chaise at Worcester, or even farther. I have finished a
building opposite to the new sta∣ble, which I think you saw.—They
together give my house a degree of splendour. Did you see my
priory?—a tenant's house, one room whereof is to have Gothic shields
round the cornice.—I am in some doubt whether to make it an House of
Lords or House of Commons; if the former, my private friends will have
shields round my Gothic bed-chrmber.—The wretch is cursed that
<HI>begins</HI> a letter with no better a pen than I <HI>finish</HI> one

<P>IF you knew the maxims on which I conduct myself, you might call
me perhaps <HI>unpolite</HI>; but, I think, by no means <HI>unfriendly</HI>; I
mean with respect to the <HI>ordinary congratulations</HI> on your
<HI>marriage.</HI> Were you and I less intimate, less ex∣perienced, and
less assured friends, it had been no venial omission to have
neglected such a ce∣remony. Perhaps I should not have neglected it; but as
I have the satisfaction of believing that you would rejoice in any
success of mine, <PB N="219" REF="240"/> so I hope you would not
distrust my sentiments upon any change of your condition which you
yourself esteemed for the <HI>better.</HI> I do indeed, my worthy friend,
wish you much joy, both <HI>now,</HI> and at <HI>all</HI> times; and you will
ever discern it in my face, as often as fortune grants us an
inter∣view.—Mr. S— is a benevolent man, and I am sure would
with-hold no information that tended to <HI>illustrate</HI> our friendship
on either side.</P>
<P>I have thoughts of proceeding on to Harbury, whenever I come to Mr.
Wren's: as I have long enough made my friend a promise; and intend ere long
to do. Many reasons occur why I cannot set forward to-morrow morning: are
these rea∣sons substantial, or no other than the sly and
sophistical insinuations of indolence?—surely the former.</P>
<P>Dodsley, and indeed Mr. Spence, both expect me in town this
February.—I fear it will not <HI>be</HI>; but if it <HI>should,</HI>
how readily would I give notice, and become obliged to you for your
company.</P>
<P>Though I should have <HI>expected</HI> you would select a
partner whose society you could enjoy, yet I was not a little satisfied
with the hint given me in your letter, as well as in one I had before re∣ceived
from Mr. S—. It is not for such ladies as you and I esteem, that Mrs.

substituted about twelve or fourteen of his own. However, he is now going
to print his fourth edition of it; in which the original epilogue will be
restored, as well as considerable improvements introduc∣ed into his play.
He sold two thousand of his first edition, the very first day he
published it.</P>
<P>I have so <HI>much</HI> to tell you, and of so <HI>various</HI>
kinds that I am afraid to expatiate upon <HI>any</HI> one article. Cannot you
make a shift to call upon <PB N="220" REF="241"/> me, before <HI>my public
life</HI> arrives?—I would send my chaise to meet you at any place
you should appoint.</P>
<P>I have passed my winter hitherto pretty chear∣fully amongst my
books, in what I <HI>call</HI> my libra∣ry. It now better deserves that name,
by the form I have given it, and the volumes I have ad∣ded.—Mr. S— would
tell you something of my <HI>other</HI> occupations.</P>
<P>I could wish that you would favour me with a copy of your
Essay on Electricity, and with any new copy of verses of your own, or of
your friends.—Be not apprehensive: there shall no∣thing more appear
in print of your composition, without your explicit consent.—And yet
I have thoughts of amusing myself with the publication of a small
Miscellany from neighbour Basker∣ville's press, if I can save myself
harmless as to expence.—I purpose it no larger than a 
<Q REND="inline">"Lans∣down's," a "Philips's," or a "Pomfret's

<P>Have you read my friend Dr. Grainger's Tibul∣lus?—It affords
you an elegant edition of a good translation and of the text. He is engaged
in a war with S—, and has just sent me his pamphlet; which I could
wish you to read, in order to form a judgement of S—'s character.
Spence, I see, has advertised his

It is mere∣ly a charitable design: and such are now all Spence's views.</P>

<SALUTE>Dear Mr. Graves,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU will think my silence long; and I should be sorry to
<HI>have</HI> you quite regard∣less of it; although, I fear, it must be my
fate to trespass frequently upon your kind solicitude.—I have no
excuse to make, besides some frivolous avocations, and <HI>much</HI> of
that heaviness and lassi∣tude which disinclines one to write
letters.—I passed the former part of winter with more vi∣vacity than
I did the latter, or even the incipient spring; owing, possibly, to
these cold winds, which will not permit me to use my wonted exercise. You
will laugh at the word <HI>vivacity,</HI> when applied to so dull an animal;
but I speak comparatively of that unmeaning drowsiness which is my lot at
other times, and <HI>was,</HI> in some sort, while you were here.</P>
<P>Mr. Dodsley tells me, he received a letter from you, acquainting
him that Cleone would be played at Bath: I should be glad to receive from you
any particulars of its success. He is publish∣ing an elegant edition of
it, which I expect by this very post. The new plate of my grove, which will
appear at the end of his Melpomene, is perhaps liable to some exceptions;
but, by much, the best that has yet appeared. Do not forget to send me your
objections to it. As to <PB N="222" REF="243"/> the epilogue, I have totally
banished, I think, every one of the lines which he <HI>substituted</HI>;
have left to him the choice of two or three readings for the four last lines;
and though none of them quite please me, yet the epilogue, on the whole,
discovers more of genius, is more spirited, and less inaccurate. I
shall be glad to find that you think the same with me.</P>
<P>In regard to your place, so far as I can form an idea of it, I
would have you consult <HI>self</HI>-amuse∣ment; I mean, without too much
regard to what <HI>others</HI> say or think. As to distinguishing your
ingenuity (which I unfeignedly desire you may) the press affords you more
<HI>adequate</HI> materials than either your fortune or, perhaps, your place.
Do not imagine, however, that I shall not be much delighted with every
stroke I trace of yours at Claverton. My faculties are very strongly
in∣tuitive in respect of every thing belonging to you: and I should be
ashamed if any nook or angle that you had rounded; any wall that you had
ruina∣ted; any stream that you had diverted; or any single shrub that you
had planted; should elude my discovery: yet you will shine <HI>more</HI>
by means of the press; and if I said any thing concerning your —,
that did not <HI>encourage</HI> you to perfect it, I am sure, I must use
terms very inexpressive of my meaning. Without any more words, let me
<HI>intreat</HI> you to proceed with it; give a <HI>full scope</HI> to your
imagination; and if there should be aught one would wish
<HI>retrenched,</HI> it is mighty <HI>easily done.</HI></P>
<P>I have indeed <HI>thoughts</HI> (for I <HI>never</HI> use the word
<HI>resolutions</HI>) of publishing my Elegies next winter;—you will
gainsay, when I tell you my intention of publishing also my very farm; at
least, about eight or ten scenes taken from it, by way of top∣and
tail-pieces for those elegies.—The world will perhaps tax my vanity;
but I do not in the least <PB N="223" REF="244"/> care.—The pleasure
which that world gives me, I am very conscious, will not be too
<HI>high</HI>; and I am determined that the pain it may seek to give shall
bear proportion: yet should I be sorry to obtrude stuff upon it, either
from the pencil or the pen; and my good friend Mr. Dodsley has sometimes
pained me, not a little.</P>
<P>I tell you, you <HI>cannot</HI> allow for winter.—That very
scene near Priory-gate shews not a bit of road in <HI>summer</HI>; though
the consciousness of a firm rail there would add to my own
tranquilli∣ty—Mr. Knight has given me Strange's prints, which, I hear,
are fine. Dodsley gives me swans; but for these two months past I have
been a librarian, or rather a bookbinder; yet nothing more

<SALUTE>Dear Mr. Graves,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>DEPEND upon it, I shall see Claverton before winter.—The
mischief is, that, with as violent a propensity as ever person felt, I
shall not be able to reach your hemisphere, while Mr. Spence, Mr.
Dodsley, and Mr. Whitehead give it such peculiar lustre, in my eyes. This
I did not despair of doing at the time Mr. Dodsley left me at Birmingham.
It turned upon an event, which I did not indeed explain to him, the
accommodation of the affair with D—; which concerns near one half of my
little fortune, and which, if I have any luck on my side, must 
<PB N="224" REF="245"/> now be perfected within a fortnight. I was shewn the
rough sketch of our <HI>conveyances</HI> last Saturday.—Once for all,
my <HI>indolence</HI> is not in fault; my health and my worldly
embarrassments <HI>have</HI> often been so, and at present
<HI>are.</HI> 
<Q REND="inline">"Pol me miserum, patrone, vocares, si verum,
&amp;c."</Q></P>
<P>Dodsley, to give his book eclat, should allow himself time to
<HI>abridge</HI> and <HI>polish.</HI> It is not enough in my opinion, merely
to surpass L'Es∣trange and Croxall. The grand <HI>exception</HI> to
Fables consists in giving <HI>speech</HI> to animals, &amp;c. a greater
<HI>violation</HI> of <HI>truth</HI> than appears in any other kind of writing!
This objection is insur∣mountable. Their peculiar <HI>advantage</HI> is to
re∣move the offensiveness of advice; in order to which, one should
perhaps pursue a medium betwixt the superfluous garniture of La Fontaine,
&amp;c. and the naked simplicity and laconism of Phaedrus. In respect of
his own new-invented Fables, I wish him to devise uncommon subjects, and
to inculcate refined morals. But pray send me <HI>your</HI> two directly,
which will answer all that I expect in Fables.</P>
<P>Did Mr. Dodsley tell you of the seat in my shrubbery which I
had taken the freedom to in∣scribe to you? I could not <HI>satisfy</HI>
myself in an inscription; and, from a kind of spleen and aversion to
delay, made use of the shortest that I could devise. The seat and
scroll are elegant. The inscription, only,

<P>I will not be so affected as to pretend that the much greater

is pleasing to my <PB N="225" REF="246"/> friendship. I wish however it
could be a little shortened. The

<OPENER><DATELINE>The Leasowes, 
<DATE>Oct. 26, 1759.</DATE></DATELINE> 
<SALUTE>Dear Mr. Graves,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I WANT no conviction of the pleasure which you will receive from
the termination of my infernal lawsuit. It must, if I have <HI>any</HI>
luck, be finally adjusted in about nine days time; after having robbed me of
my peace for <PB N="228" REF="249"/> six of the best years of my life.
During the <HI>for∣mer</HI> part of life, I languished for an acquaintance
somewhat more extensive; and when the com∣pany that flocked to see my
place removed all grounds of <HI>that</HI> complaint, this accursed dispute
arose, and mixed with every enjoyment that was offered me.—I have
sometimes found entertain∣ment in balancing the good and evil that has been
allotted me in general; and have in the end imagined the good prevalent, and
that I have great reason to be thankful for more happiness than I
deserve.—Yet are there many awkward circumstances that forbid the
<HI>scale</HI> to fall <HI>precipi∣tately</HI>; among the chief, I place the
distance to which I see you and one or two others removed. This is indeed
an heavy article, and, were it not for letters, would be insupportable.</P>
<P>As to Mr. Dodsley's collection of Fables, you are mistaken if
you think that I perused the quar∣to book. I dipped into it here and there,
and thought there wanted <HI>much</HI> alteration. There was a little book with
a paper-cover, on which I bestowed no small pains; and when I had so
done, crossed the Fables which I thought might well enough pass muster.
Addison would have been the best writer of Fables of any author I
know—the purity of style—the conciseness—the dry
humour—and the familiar manner.—As to Dodsley's publishing this
winter, he may possibly do so, without loss of credit; but when one
con∣siders that they are, or ought to be, the standard for years to come,
one can hardly avoid wishing him to give them the polish of another
summer. 'Twas fortunate that you pitched upon 
<Q REND="inline">"The Raven and Magpie"</Q> to transcribe for me;
as Mr. Dodsley had sent me 
<Q REND="inline">"The Sun-flower and the Tuberose"</Q>
<HI>before.</HI> I think the last somewhat inferior, but will re-consider
it before I write again. The Fable which I literally translated 
<PB N="229" REF="250"/> from Phaedrus was 
<Q REND="inline">"The Wolf and the Crane,"</Q> in order to give
Dodsley an idea on <HI>what</HI> Rollin laid the stress in Fables.</P>
<P>As to the inscription, I will endeavour to ad∣just it to your
mind—
<Q REND="inline">"Meritisque reconditiori∣bus"</Q> may do, but is
not explicit enough. I want fully to express a character that shines
remarka∣bly among select acquaintance, and yet (through extreme refinement)
makes less figure in the pub∣lic eye.</P>
<P>I had made the same objection to Burke's chapter upon
<HI>words</HI>—and yet there seems to be something right in it. Du
Bos (which I have only seen in <HI>French,</HI> but which I believe is also
translated) consists of three volumes, 12mo. His subjects are
pleasing, and his knowledge may be entertaining; but his genius seems not
very pro∣found, from the little that I have consulted in him.</P>
<P>Dodsley is <HI>precisely</HI> what you say of him; an object
of esteem and love, and in some <HI>degree</HI> of admiration. His
<HI>ear</HI> does not wholly please me in writing, and yet he is intimately
affected with musick.—Lord L—'s ear is perhaps the reverse. I
mean, he does not much regard music, yet writes harmoniously in verse and
prose.</P>
<P>Robertson I think to buy—Butler also, though I shall not
admire him—Lord Clarendon, when I am <HI>rich</HI>—Rasselas has
a few refined sentiments thinly scattered, but is upon the whole below Mr.
J—. Did I tell you I had a letter from Johnson, inclosing Vernon's
Parish-clerk? Pray take Dodsley's advice in regard to your —; and
heighten the ridiculousness of your <HI>heroe,</HI> which <HI>his</HI> kind
of <HI>lunacy</HI> will countenance, yet admit him to say good
things.—But do not make any alteration in the narrative of your own
sto∣ry—at least, till I have again perused it—Do not spurn
this fifty pounds. It will procure you <PB N="230" REF="251"/> numerous
conveniences, which you would per∣haps otherwise deny yourself.</P>
<P>I have passed four or five days, betwixt this week and last,

<P>I have three or four more of these superb vi∣sits to make, and
which I may not omit without giving real offence. To Lord Plymouth, next week;
Lord Stamford's, the week after; then to Lord Lyttelton, at our Admiral's; and
then to Lord Foley, if your friend Dr. Charleton will accompany me; then,

of my farm reduced to minia∣ture by a neighbouring artist. Let me know if it
bring the place to your memory—I think to have a plate (which may be done
at Birmingham for six or eight shillings) that shall leave me no trouble
but to tinge the impressions with colours; in order to give my friends. But
do you advise me to engrave <HI>this,</HI> or another that is twice as
large?</P>

<SALUTE>Dear Mr. Graves,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THOUGH I write to you again so soon, yet it really grieves me to
hear the com∣plaint which you so often make for want of time. I, who have
time to <HI>waste</HI> by lustres, cannot have patience with the world,
that suffers <HI>you</HI> to want the leisure which you would employ to
so much better purposes. Perhaps however, you are as <HI>happy</HI> as more
leisure could <HI>make</HI> you; the case is not so <HI>clear,</HI> as to
leave me satisfied of the con∣trary. And yet, as the pleasures of
imagination have an undoubted claim to a real existence, they must surely
afford very <HI>lively</HI> sensations to persons of your sensibility
and refinement.—Be this as it may, I <HI>will</HI> always
<HI>murmur,</HI> that you can so ill spare time for literary
amusement.—Never∣theless, make <HI>one</HI> effort, and finish the
task you have now before you. I must confess, you may naturally reply,
that I am now become an inte∣rested person; but <HI>this,</HI> I am sure,
will be no check to your activity.</P>
<P>Mr. William Duncombe sent (with the first volume of Horace) one
of the satires in Ms. <PB N="230" REF="253"/>

<HI>inscribed to me.</HI> Upon purchasing, however, the second volume, I
find <HI>my</HI> name is changed to Hawkesworth.—Who knows but I lost
this com∣pliment by writing to you, my friend, while I should have been
writing to him?—if so, indeed, you ought to make it up to me; and I am
sure I shall prize <HI>your</HI> compliment beyond that of which I have
been deprived.</P>
<P>The view of B—, which you mention, I have indeed seen a long
time ago; but surely the <HI>wa∣ter-fall</HI> is quite detestable. There is
something on each side, as I remember, that puts one in mind of a
porridge-pot boiling over beneath the pot-lid. The appearance of the house
and the back-ground is better; this was adjusted by the painter; the other
(as I think Smith told me) by an old house-steward of Lord T—'s.</P>
<P>I have inclosed another copy of the lines to Venus, for your
emendation.—Thank you for the stanza you introduced.—I meant,
indeed, <HI>before,</HI> to allude to <HI>natural</HI> beauty more than
<HI>mo∣ral;</HI> but did not fully enough express myself. There remains no
transition now but from <HI>animal</HI> beauty to <HI>inanimate</HI>; which
is easier.</P>
<P>You will observe, that I take great liberties with the Fables you
ask me to revise.—Dodsley must think me <HI>very</HI>
fantastical or <HI>worse,</HI> while I was correcting those he wrote at
The Leasowes.—I find my <HI>ear</HI> much more apt to take offence than
most other people's; and, as <HI>his</HI> is far less delicate than mine,
he must of course believe, in many places, that I altered merely for
alte∣ration's sake. I cannot be easy without some certain proportion
betwixt one sentence and ano∣ther; betwixt one member of a sentence and
ano∣ther; without a melody at the close of a paragraph almost as agreeable
as your 
<Q REND="inline">"magnificent salon."</Q></P>
<P>I have not written to Dodsley any decent let∣ter since he
arrived at his house in London.—<PB N="233" REF="256"/> I must now
apply myself to write half a score Fables, and, if he chuses it, a
translation of La Motte's Discourse upon the subject.—Your reply
in regard to the delay of <HI>my</HI> publication cannot be answered; that is
certain.</P>
<P>Whitefield's Journal, I <HI>fear,</HI> is purged of its
<HI>most</HI> ridiculous passages.—Dodsley brought one down
hither for Mr. Deane to shew my Lord D—th; but he tells me, there
remains nothing of that <HI>gross</HI> absurdity which I saw in your
bro∣ther's at Mickleton.</P>
<P>The painter whom I just mentioned to have taken some portraits
through my recommendati∣on, and to have painted a ruin for my green∣room,
offers to give me my picture if I chuse to sit.—Were you here to lend
me your assistance, I should certainly comply.—Mean while, tell
me what you think of some of the attitudes that I inclose. What I myself
prefer at present is, to <HI>lessen</HI> my <HI>dimensions</HI> (which
of itself gives a kind of beauty) and to appear in a kind of night-gown
agreeable to the attitude marked AA. The man evidently hits off likenesses,
and is esteemed to <HI>shine</HI> among the painters of Birmingham. I
shall be forced to have you picture copied by him, which, by means of
dampness, flies off the canvas; so that, on the whole, I shall re pay his
compliment.—This last article puts me in mind that I owe you my
picture, whenever you de∣mand it; but I would chuse to defer it till the
spring, for some certain reasons regarding oecono∣my. Remember me
<HI>always</HI> to good Mrs. —; and believe me yours, with all
possible affection,</P>

Picture.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>The Leasowes, 
<DATE>Jan. 8, 1760.</DATE></DATELINE> 
<SALUTE>Dear Mr. Graves,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WERE I to regulate my compliments by the arrival of <HI>times</HI>
and seasons, I should congratulate you upon a <HI>correspondence</HI>
which now enters upon its three and twentieth year.—Our
<HI>frienship</HI> is of something older date; and is not this an
<HI>atchievement</HI> that deserves the honour of a <HI>triumph</HI> both for
you and me too?—More, I am sure, than the regular destruction of
fifteen or twenty thousand wretches in the field; consider∣ing how
<HI>uncommon</HI> we find friendships of so long a duration, and how
<HI>cheap</HI> we find such victories, not only on the Prussian, but on
the Austrian side.</P>
<P>Mr. Cambridge (Scriblerus) who called here this autumn, was
considering this massacre rather in a philosophical than political
view; and, in∣deed, it does not appear to me that plague, earthquake, or
famine, are more pernicious to the human race, than what the world calls
Heroes; but enough of this.</P>
<P>Your want of leisure gives me pain; surely, if I may guess by
one or two of your last letters, you have enlarged the number of your
scholars, and extended your domestic cares, beyond what your
circumstances <HI>require.</HI></P>
<P>You must not judge of my painter's abilities by the small
sketch I inclose.—I desired him to give me a <HI>slight</HI> one;
and have, perhaps, ruined even <HI>that</HI> by endeavouring to bring it nearer
to what the picture now <HI>is myself.</HI> It will give you a tolerable idea
in the most points, except the Pan, which has his face turned towards the 
<PB N="235" REF="258"/> front; and is not near so considerable.—I
chose to have this <HI>term</HI> introduced, not only as he car∣ries my
favourite reeds, but as he is the princi∣pal <HI>sylvan</HI> deity.—The
Water-nymph below has the word 
<Q REND="inline">"Stour"</Q> on the mouth of her urn; which in some
sort, rises at The Leasowes. On the scroll is, 
<Q REND="inline">"Flumina amem sylvasque inglorius"</Q> alluding
to them <HI>both.</HI>—The Pan, you will per∣haps observe, hurts the
<HI>simplicity</HI> of the picture—not much, as we have managed him;
and the intention here is, I think, a balance.</P>
<P>The dog on the other side is my faithful Lucy, which you perhaps
remember; and who <HI>must</HI> be <HI>nearer</HI> the <HI>body</HI> than
she perhaps would, if we had more room. However I believe, I shall cause
her head to cut off that little cluster of angles, where the balustrade
joins the base of the arch. The balustrade is an improvement we made the
other day: it is, I think, a great one; not only as it gives a symmetry or
balance to the curtain of which you complained; but as it ex∣tends the
<HI>area</HI> on which I stand, and shortens the <HI>length</HI> of this
<HI>half-arch.</HI> The painter objected to a tree; I know not why; unless
that we could introduce no <HI>stem</HI> without encroaching too much upon
the landscape: but the reason be gave was, it would be an injury to the
face.—The con∣sole is an Apollo's head. The impost does not go
further than the pilaster, which ends the cor∣ner; and here the drawing is
erroneous.—We are, I think, to have a carpet, though we know not well how
to manage it.</P>
<P>And now, I must tell you the dimensions.—The figure
itself is three feet, three inches and a half; the whole picture four feet,
eleven inches, by two feet, three inches and three-quarters.—The colour
of the gown, a sea-green; waistcoat and breeches, buff-colour; stockings,
white, or rather pearl-colour; curtain a terra-sienna, or 
<PB N="236" REF="259"/> very rich reddish brown.—I think the whole will
have a good effect; but beseech you to send me your opinion
<HI>directly.</HI> There are some things we can alter; but there are others
we must not.</P>
<P>Your shall have one of the size you desire in the spring;
but will you not calculate for some one place in your room? The painter takes
very strong likenesses; is young; rather daring than delicate in his
manner, though he paints well in enamel; good-natured; slovenly; would
im∣prove much by application. Adieu!</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>The Leasowes. 
<DATE>Feb. 9, 1760,</DATE></DATELINE> 
<SALUTE>Dear Mr. Graves,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I COULD not understand, by Mr. Dodsley's last letter to me,
that he had any <HI>sort</HI> of in∣tention to publish his Fables this
winter. Pre∣suming upon this delay, and having neither had the
<HI>leisure</HI> nor the <HI>frame</HI> of mind fit to take his preface into
consideration, I have hitherto de∣ferred to do so; and can only say in
<HI>general,</HI> that I could wish you had happened to be more co∣pious in
your observations. La Motte's Discourse on Fables is a most excellent
performance; con∣taining, as appears to <HI>me,</HI> all that need be said
upon the subject, and this expressed with all imaginable elegance and
perspicuity. I believe I shall advise our friend D— to make more
am∣ple use of this dissertation. There is a translati∣on of La Motte
into <HI>prose,</HI> which is altogether <HI>below contempt;</HI> and yet,
for aught I know, the <PB N="237" REF="260"/> <HI>only</HI> one. The word
<HI>naive</HI> is very probably <HI>that</HI> for which he has substituted
the word <HI>lively</HI>; though by no means of similar import.
<HI>Natural</HI> approaches nearer it; but according to La Mot∣te is not
precise: and, as the words <HI>Naif</HI> and <HI>Naiveté</HI> seem
of late to become more in vouge, I will here give you an extract of what he
says upon the subject: 
<Q REND="inline">"Je ne souhaiterois plus rien à l'Auteur de
Fables, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> ce n'est d'être
fidele au sentiment, &amp; de le peindre toujours avec la <HI>Naivete</HI>
qui le caracterise; car j'ose encore dis∣tinguer le <HI>Naturel</HI>
&amp; le <HI>Naif.</HI> Le <HI>Naturel</HI> renferme une idée plus
vague, &amp; il est opposé en général au
<HI>Recherché,</HI> au <HI>Forcé</HI> au lieu, que le
<HI>Naif</HI> l'est particulierement au <HI>Réflechi,</HI> &amp;
n'appartient qu'au <HI>sentiment.</HI> 
<P>"Le <HI>sublime,</HI> selon cette idée,
peut-être <HI>Naif.</HI> La Reponse du vieil Horace à la
question qu'on lui fait sur la conduite de son fils; que vouliez∣vous
qu'il fit contre trois? <HI>Qu'il mourut.</HI> Cette reponse est
<HI>naive</HI>; parce que c'est l'expression toute nuë du
<HI>sentiment</HI> de ce Romain; qui préfére la mort de son
fils à sa honte. Il ne <HI>répond</HI> pas
précisément à ce qu'on lui demande; il dit seule∣ment
ce qu'il <HI>sent.</HI> Ce n'est que dans la vers suivant que la
<HI>Reflexion</HI> succéde à la <HI>Naiveté.</HI> 
<Q>Ou qu'un beau désespoir alors le secourut.</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">"Il <HI>raisonne</HI> dans ce vers; il n'a
fait que <HI>sentir</HI> dans le premier.</Q></P> 
<P>"Les occasions du <HI>Naif</HI> sont, peut-être, plus
fréquentes dans la Fable; &amp; l'eloge de La Fon∣taine, est de n'en
avoir gueres manquées; dans la Fable du Pot au Lait, le discours qu'il
prêto à sa Latiere est un ches-d'oeuvre de
<HI>Naiveté,</HI> d'autant plus singulier, que sous <HI>l'apparence
du raisonne∣ment</HI> le plus suivi, le <HI>sentiment</HI> se montre
dans toute sa force; ou pour mieux dire, dans toute son
<HI>yvresse.</HI>"</P></Q></P>
<P><PB N="238" REF="261"/>And now, let me know what English word you
would employ to interpret <HI>Naif. Sentimen∣tal</HI> has some pretensions;
but is not wholly to one's mind.</P>
<P>I bought the quarto edition of La Motte's Fables, to which this
essay is prefixed; though the vaunted cuts which tempted me to this
ex∣travagance did not answer my expectation. The author, with much address,
begs the Duke of Orleans to be at the expence of them; which, to the best of
my remembrance, was 
<Q REND="inline">"deux mille ecus."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Hurd, you see, is one of Dr. Warburton's Chaplains. I bought
his Dialogues Moral and Political, almost as soon they were published.
Sir Edward Lyttelton told me, the introductory one would be omitted in the next
edition. The three following are very ingenious; but the two former are a
little ambiguous in regard to his in∣tended moral: the two last are wholly
political, and I have not yet perused them, though esteem∣ed the
<HI>best.</HI></P>
<P>Have you seen Dr. Smith's 
<Q REND="inline">"Theory of Mo∣ral Sentiments,"</Q> which is
prodigiously commend∣ed, and which I have bought, but not read?—You
will see an account of this in the Monthly Review.</P>
<P>I have lately been reading one or two volumes of The Rambler; who,
excepting against some few hardnesses in his manner, 
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He too often makes use of the Abstract
for the Concrete.</NOTE> and the want of more examples to enliven, is one of
the most <HI>nervous,</HI> most <HI>perspicuous,</HI> most concise,
and most harmonious prose-writers I know.—A learned diction improves
by time.</P>
<P>I am sorry to find no mention of your — in all the letters
which I have received of late. Do not think of <HI>dropping</HI> or even
<HI>delaying</HI> the publi∣cation of it; only, if you please, before it goes
to <PB N="239" REF="262"/> the press, let me peruse it once
deliberately.—What think you, if Dodsley approve it, of ad∣mitting cuts
into your scheme?</P>
<P>And now, from <HI>cuts</HI> I proceed to <HI>pictures.</HI> Alcock's
portrait of me is in a manner finished; and has been hung up for these nine
days past, in its carved frame, opposite to the fire place in my library.
<HI>They say</HI> it is a likeness, allowing for the diminution of size.
Indeed, if I can conclude any thing from the strong resemblance which he
has produced of <HI>others</HI> here, I may form some <HI>conjecture</HI>
that he has not failed in mine.—Be this as it will, the picture is, upon
the whole a tolerably pleasing one; and this is the <HI>most</HI> I must
dare to say, considering my own person makes so large a part of it.</P>
<P>What think you of a tawney or reddish brown for the robe or
night-gown, with black for the waistcoat and breeches, reserving green for
the curtain? though green is, with me at least, no very gay colour, nor has
it that effect which you apprehended in the drapery. Terra-sienna is a
delightful colour; so, I think, is Roman ocre burnt. Let me know then, what
objections you have to the drapery just now proposed. Let me know also
any design that you think most pleas∣ing for a back-ground; or any
story of two or three figures, that would be suitable for a relievo.</P>
<P>From <HI>pictures</HI> I proceed to <HI>painters.</HI> I believe,
Alcock would go and settle at Bath, if Amos Green could be induced to join
him. Amos Green is the name of the painter whom I recommended to you <HI>before
my fever.</HI> He is esteemed inferior to no one in England for fruit. He
also paints flowers, insects, and dead-game, <HI>very</HI> well. To this he
would adjoin the business of water-painting. Alcock would paint portraits
in oil; and to this he would add enamel-painting: both of them 
<PB N="240" REF="263"/> the best-natured young fellows in the world. Now
suppose them also <HI>ingenious,</HI> and tell me whether they would have
a chance to <HI>thrieve</HI>?</P>
<P>You ought to have a very considerable <HI>amends,</HI> if you are
to be plagued with writing and with music-masters.—I believe I rate
your time and trouble at a much higher price than you do yourself.</P>
<P>Dr. Blackstone has raised himself to a very eminent figure,
indeed, in the world of letters. I rejoice at it, without one particle of envy,
both as he is your friend, and a person of merit. I believe no one, besides
yourself, would have dreamt of your odd analogy betwixt him and me.—I
know not <HI>how</HI> they came to insert that in∣sipid Song of mine in the
Chronicle.—What sensation it caused in me, was that of
disappro∣bation; as it looked like laying stress on what one knows to be
of no importance.</P>
<P>The chief points wherein my picture varies from your drawing is in
the corner below the base of the pedestal; where an antique vase is
introduced with a flower and two or three leaves of the scarlet Geranium. The
gilt vase agrees well enough with the gold fringe on the edge of the curtain;
but the whole is so <HI>subdued,</HI> as not to catch the eye too
strongly. It was chiefly meant to obviate the disagreebleness of the
<HI>parallel</HI> lines and angles occasioned by the step in that corner;
but it crowds that side a little, if one look from top to bottom; and, though
a pleasing object, it is hard to say whether it does more good or harm.</P>
<P>It is time now to take my leave, with my hearty respects to Mrs.
Graves, and with the usual assurance, that I remain your most
affectio∣nate and faithful friend,</P>

<SALUTE>Dear Mr. Graves,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I MUST confess that I do not altogether find your argument
conclusive.—An hurry of bu∣siness <HI>may</HI> be necessary,
and somewhat incon∣sistent with frequent correspondence; but a state
of <HI>leisure,</HI> which I wished you, does not imply a course of
<HI>dissipation</HI>; which makes your present apology for not writing to
me before. And so, betwixt business at one time, and dissipation at
another, I am to be defrauded of a correspondence that is quite essential
to my well-being. Pardon me, if, on such occasion, you find me extremely
clear-sighted in the foibles of my friends; and do not say with the man in
Horace, 
<Q REND="inline">"Cur in ami∣corum vitiis, &amp;c."</Q> The
<HI>matter</HI> is too <HI>important</HI> for me to connive at any sort of

the letter was owing to <HI>you</HI>; for which I will draw my apology neither
from <HI>business</HI> nor dissipation; and yet how justly might I
palliate my long silence upon <HI>either</HI> footing! Since I wrote to you,
I have been <HI>busied</HI> in bringing about a conclusion with D—.
The letters, journies, &amp;c. <HI>previous</HI> and <HI>posterior</HI> to
the execu∣tion of articles, would afford me noble matter for
excuse.—The constant attendance upon workmen (of which I have
fourteen or fifteen this very day,) making a piece of water below my Priory,
would produce more on the score of <HI>dissipation</HI>—you
remember the place.—This, at present, is my chief employment, although
Al∣cock is drawing on the side of my table.—I wonder you do not get

done something of this sort for me. You may, if you so please, have the
ground a dark <HI>bronze,</HI> and the figures a <HI>light</HI> one. I am of
late grown fond of bronze (which you yourself may easily execute) and I
think it always was your taste.—Dodsley comes hither in about a
fortnight, and prints <HI>one</HI> edition of his Fables by means of
Baskerville's press and paper. <HI>Mean time,</HI> he is to <HI>give</HI>
me his picture done by Reynolds; and to <HI>send</HI> me two bronzed
plaister urns, of about twelve inches, with basso-relievo; and two
figures (ditto) of Homer and Virgil (of about twenty-one inches) for two niches
in my libra∣ry The parcel is to be pieced out with Ogilby's Virgil, which I
want for the sake of the land∣scapes.—And now to the particulars of
your letter.</P>
<P>I can readily conceive how much greater pleasure you must
receive from the <HI>retinue</HI> of your journey, than an Archbishop can
from all his equipage; and I can truly assure you, I find a pleasure in
every pleasure you enjoy.</P>
<P>Your room, indeed, will be a noble one; but be sure remember the 
<Q REND="inline">"Imploravit opes hominis, fraenumque recepit,"</Q>
and guard against it.—To speak my sentiments, I think you will. I
think with you in regard to Tristram Shandy; so does the author of The
Monthly Review, you will see. I bought Webb instantly; but have not read
it. Lord Lyttelton is <HI>allowedly</HI> the author of those Dialogues;
whose, the very last, I do not know. There is a noble specimen of Scotch
poetry translated from the Erse language.—I have had two copies
sent me from Scotland; and, had I two franks, would send you one. 
<Q REND="inline">"Chry∣sal, or the The Adventures of a Guinea"</Q>

<HI>ever</HI> occurs that obstructs my travelling at all—and though I

<HI>be</HI> it certainly will, when I accompany Mr. Knight to Mr. Bamfylde's;

<HI>fill</HI> my present letter even with the best-ground∣ed

have there, is in the <HI>Essay</HI>; in the <HI>original Fables,</HI>
al∣though <PB N="244" REF="269"/> I can hardly claim a single Fable as my own;
and in the <HI>Index,</HI> which I caused to be thrown into the form of
<HI>Morals,</HI> and which are almost wholly mine. I wish to God it may
sell; for he has been at great expence about it. The two rivals which he has
to dread, are, the editi∣ons of Richardson and of Croxall. The
<HI>Fables</HI> in Croxall are tolerably writen: his <HI>reflections,</HI>
little to the purpose, either for boys or grown people.—Richardson's
<HI>Improvement of L'Estrange</HI> would be a better collection, both for the
<HI>Fables</HI> and the <HI>moral Reflections,</HI> had he not admitted,
through an extravagant and mistaken love of drollery, that vulgarity of
phrase which in many places is not <HI>common English.</HI> This, I think,
a true state of the case: say the best you can in behalf of
Dodsley.—As to his cuts, though to <HI>him</HI> expensive, they will
hardly, I fear, meet with much of your approbation.—the scale is much
too small—and the emblematick prints which are larger will scarce, I
fear, be understood.—I pro∣cured a copy from Baskerville
<HI>before</HI> the plates were <HI>inserted,</HI> and have caused my
painter (Alcock) to supply the vacancies with some devices of my
own—some account of which I send you, as it may amuse you for a
minute. I want one or two to compleat my scheme, and should be glad if you
would propose some in your next letter.—I return you my hearty thanks
for the hints you gave for the Cambridge verses; but when I received them it
was too late, and I myself too much indisposed, either to throw them into
proper form, or even to answer that gentleman's letter, which I thought a
very gen∣teel one.—I know not what he did on that occa∣sion, having
seen neither Cambridge nor Oxford verses—Mr. Dodsley gave me 
<Q REND="inline">"The Environs of London."—</Q>Between friends,
I wish he may find five thousand readers, whom the management of that work
pleases more than <HI>me.</HI>—I will try to <PB N="245" REF="270"/> get
you some of the <HI>cuts,</HI> if you desire me to do so, though it will
reflect a kind of tacit dislike of the <HI>whole</HI> performance—His
brother publishes this winter 
<Q REND="inline">"The Works of Soame Jenyns,"</Q> in three
pocket-volumes; and a Chinese novel from a Ms. translation revised,
&amp;c. by a friend of mine. You have perhaps heard me speak of Mr.
Percy—he <HI>was</HI> in treaty with Mr. James Dodsley, for the
publication of our best old bal∣lads, in three volumes. He has a large folio
Ms. of ballads, which he shewed me, and which, with his own natural and
acquired talents, would qualify him for the purpose, as well as any man in
Eng∣land. I proposed the scheme for him <HI>myself,</HI> wishing to
see an elegant <HI>edition</HI> and good col∣lection of this kind.—I
was also to have assisted him in selecting and rejecting; and in
fixing upon the best readings—But my illness broke off our
correspondence, the beginning of winter—and I know not what he has done
since.—There is a New Peerage going to be published—with, I
believe, the draughts of the Peers houses—Lightholer called here, and
said he had taken Lord Lyttleton's, and Lord Stamford's, for that
purpose.—the latter of which he shewed me.—Thus have I told you
what I hear of new <HI>publi∣cations</HI>—as to what passes in the
busy world, I know no more than the Chronicle informs me,—unless when
<HI>your</HI> letters happen to be <HI>rounded</HI> with little anecdotes from
Bath.—Have you seen Baskerville's new Prayer-books?—My Lord
Dartmouth has undertaken to present two to the King and Princess.—Do,
for <HI>charity</HI> sake, make me some amends for this long chasm in our
cor∣respondence, by a very early and long letter—I am sick to hear
from you; being, with ardent and sincere affection, your ever faithful friend
and servant,</P>

<SALUTE>Dear Mr. Graves,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I WILL, upon your last assurance, take it <HI>ever</HI> for
granted, that you do not omit writing upon any score of ceremony. This will
render your silence, at least in some <HI>degree,</HI> less irksome
to me; when I do not think it the effect of my own procrastination.—Mr.
Dodsley had sold two thousand of his Fables long ago; but complain∣ed
that he should <HI>lose</HI> thirty pounds by my neighbour Baskerville's
impression; and that he should not be more than ten pounds gainer upon
the <HI>whole.</HI> I told him it was enough, in books of <HI>this sort,</HI>
if the first edition paved the way for their future establishment in
schools. And surely so it is: for a book of this kind, once
established, becomes an absolute estate for many years; and brings in
at least as certain and as regular returns. I would <HI>wish</HI> him to
give the polite world one more edition from Baskerville's press; admitting
only a <HI>new</HI> sett of emblematical top and tail-pieces; and confining
those empty cuts relating to each Fable to the cheap edition which he prints
at London. A second edition of this latter sort will appear in a little
time; and if you have any improvements to propose, he will very thankfully
receive them. Mr. Spence offers him to write <HI>the life</HI> afresh; and
Spence, Burke, Lowth, and Melmoth, advise him to dis∣card
<HI>Italicks.</HI> I confess he has used them to a very great
<HI>excess,</HI> but yet I do not think they should be utterly
discarded.</P>
<P>I did not intend that Mr. Davenport should ever hear of those
verses; and how he came to do so, is past my comprehension. He seemed
to <PB N="247" REF="272"/> me to have deserted Worfield, without any
in∣tention to return again. I therefore meant to inscribe them under my own
Venus, in order to afford some novelty, at an <HI>easy rate,</HI> to
those who are curious enough to <HI>repeat</HI> their visits here. Pray, if
you see Mr. and Mrs. Davenport, present my best respects to them; and
as to the verses, I will send you a copy for them, if you <HI>desire</HI>
or <HI>advise</HI> me so to do.—Mr. S — is agreeable, not void
of learning, has some smartness, but little taste.—Mrs. S — has
<HI>much</HI> of the latter; and perhaps imagination, which makes a part of
taste, may have had no small share in converting her to Popery.—Mr.
Powys I have almost for∣gotten.—You are ingenious very inventive in
regard to the means of giving yourself mortifi∣cation. I dare to say, your
new building sug∣gests no such idea as you conceive.—And I think it
sufficient in a parsonage-house, if one sees detached specimens of
taste or elegance, without uniformity, or even without consi∣stency.</P>
<P>I do not find but that you <HI>figure</HI> among the gentry near
Bath. Dr. Charlton, who was here yesterday with Sir Francis and Mr. Knight,
gave me an account that the B— of G— had been to pay his respects
to you. I will not enter into particulars, but would wish you to cultivate
his acquaintance.—I shewed Sir Fran∣cis the dead colouring of the
picture which I intend to send to you;—but you must know that Alcock
is the most volatile of all creatures that have not wings. By way of
improving the picture I meant for Dodsley, he has made it in∣finitely less
like, and yet it must go to London as <HI>it is,</HI> for God knows when he
can be brought to alter it.</P>
<P>I asked the Doctor, how Mr. Blackstone came to obtain a seat
in Parliament; and his <PB N="248" REF="273"/> answer was, 
<Q REND="inline">"The King insisted on it, as he was a man of
learning and ingenuity."—</Q>The enmity betwixt Lord L—n and Mr.
P—, I find, conti∣nues in its full force; insomuch that my Lord is to
have no place while Mr. P— continues in the ministry.—My Lord
B—'s promotion was, it seems, demanded by the D. of N— and Mr.
P—, as they would not be exposed to bear the blame, while he was the
chief mover behind the curtain<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
These little particles of intelligence have, I believe, Sir — for their
author.—I was told by another politician, the same day, that we were
not to expect a peace—that the French, who might give up the Colonies,
would not resign the Fishery.</P>
<P>Mr. Knight, his mother and sister, go through Bath to Mr.
Bamfylde's in about three weeks, if nothing intervene. I am teazed greatly to
accompany them,—by my own <HI>inclination,</HI> I can assure you, as
well as their <HI>importunity.</HI> I do not say I will <HI>not,</HI> nor
must I ever promise you <HI>before∣hand</HI> that I <HI>will.</HI> I have
good reasons to the contrary. They have some thoughts of bringing Dr.
Charlton into the party.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>The Leasowes, 
<DATE>Sept. 14, 1761.</DATE></DATELINE> 
<SALUTE>Dear Mr. Graves,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I OUGHT to have thanked you many weeks ago, for a very <HI>long</HI>
and <HI>entertaining</HI> letter; the <HI>length</HI> of which, as well as the
<HI>entertainment,</HI> was <PB N="249" REF="274"/> increased by a
Postscript a few days after.—But as the Winter is with me a dull and
uniform season, so the Summer is a time of universal dis∣sipation;
and very happy do I think myself, when after a continual succession of
company, visits paid, and excursions taken, I can sit down in peace and
quietness, to attend to the business of correspondence and
friendship. Either reason, habit, or complexion tells me, that I am never
<HI>otherwise</HI> so properly employed.</P>
<P>The last digression I made was to the concert at Worcester,
to hear The Messiah well per∣formed; to meet a number of faces one knows;
but first, and principally, to visit your brother, <HI>without</HI> which
motive I had not gone. In the two <HI>former</HI> respects, the journey
answered my expectation:—but, alas! your brother was gone into
Herefordshire. I, however, alighted out of the chaise; and the
house-keeper very civilly shewed me his delightful parlour, that looks
in∣to the meadows, the Prebend's gardens, and down the Severn to Malvern-hills.
A more agreeable town-house cannot possibly be found any where. But I
regretted, when I reached the inn, that I had not asked to see his
children; for I either heard them up-stairs, had a glimpse of them at the
window, or fancied, to a degree of conviction, that they were most of them
within the house. I now return to remark upon some particulars in your
letter—I believe it is that indifference you complain of, which is the
<HI>grand</HI> detriment to genius in an advanced part of life. In all
<HI>poetical</HI> affairs, we are too apt to cry out with Pallas, 
<Q REND="inline">"Non est mihi tibia tanti."</Q> And this renders
all our efforts tame, prosaic, and judicious. But this propensity, as well
as many others, we should guard against, upon the approach of age: change
the object of our a∣musements; cherish hopes, well or ill-grounded, 
<PB N="250" REF="275"/> of finding that pleasure in the novelty of objects,
which we have not found in any individual. These are the means of
<HI>preserving our vivacity</HI> a somewhat longer time than it naturally
lasts; but how far it is <HI>prudent</HI> to attach ourselves to the world
that we must leave, is a point which <HI>you</HI> better can determine.
Refined taste, as it im∣plies a <HI>love</HI> of physical beauty, has this
tendency.</P>
<P>There is nothing can be more rational than what you say about the
expediency of <HI>losing no time,</HI> if I mean to collect and publish
what I have written. You are indeed very partial to my abilities; but, allowing
for <HI>that,</HI> what you mention <HI>coincides</HI> with what I have thought
my∣self, and this for some years past. A more agreeable kind of
<HI>distraction</HI> in summer, and an indifferent state of health and
spirits in winter, have hitherto prevented any progress in the cor∣rection
of my pieces. To these I might add a <HI>suspence</HI> about the
compositions, and the manner, proper for publication. I am now most
inclin∣ed to make a collection of the whole. I mean, the best of what are
already printed or in Ms.; to publish them by subscription in a large
<HI>quar∣to</HI> size for the sake of profit; and to apologize for this
method, by mentioning the expence of top and tail-pieces, with which I mean
they shall be embellished. Some of <HI>these</HI> (by the bye) may be
taken from my farm, the rest emblema∣tical, in an easy and careless, but,
at the same time, elegant manner. I should think the in∣stance of Mr.
Pope might render this method not disreputable; and it might be advertised
(as was done by Mr. Spence) that, unless a certain number were subscribed
for, the whole affair should be no farther prosecuted. This would put it in
the way of many friends to serve me, who (I flatter myself) <HI>with
inclination,</HI> esteem themselves void of <HI>opportunity.</HI> Let me
beg you <PB N="251" REF="276"/> to think seriously of this, as well as of a
general title-page, before you write again.</P>
<P>Thank you kindly for all the little diverting anecdotes that are
contained in your letter. I am glad to hear your <HI>place</HI> brings you
company; partly, as it tends to amuse you; and yet more, as it tends to make
your merit more conspicuous. You and I have led a life of total
disinteress∣ment. Let me advise you to seek some <HI>advantage</HI>
from your commerce with <HI>great men.</HI>—The boy, who was here with
you and Mrs. Graves, was here last Friday evening with a Mr. Jolliffe and his
son; the latter of whom observed your name upon the bench, and seemed
proud to de∣clare that he was once your school-fellow. Mr. Stratford (to whom
I had written about some gold-fishes) says in his answer, 
<Q REND="inline">"I had the plea∣sure from Bath of waiting upon Mr.
G—, and was as much satisfied with the miniature beau∣ties of his
place, as with the polite reception I met with from the owner."</Q> If you have
an oppor∣tunity, you will oblige me by presenting my com∣pliments to that
gentleman.—I met Dr. Charlton at Worcester, who stands high in my
esteem.—The account of Gothic architecture, &amp;c. is cu∣rious; but I
have found it in Dr. Warburton's edition of Pope.—I inclose the
verses on the Venus de Medicis.—I told you before my in∣tentions,
&amp;c. concerning them; and since, I hear that they have appeared in some
one of the Magazines—through Dodsley's or Percy's means, for I surely
gave a copy to nobody besides—and those copies must be much
imperfect.—My picture shall be sent to you as soon as I can
pos∣sibly get Alcock over, who has promised to come every week for
these three months past. I believe he <HI>will</HI> come soon.—I
did not know of Mr. Warton's compliment; but he is very obliging to me on all
occasions, and sends me <PB N="250" REF="277"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/> <PB N="251" REF="278"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/> <PB N="252" REF="279"/> all that
he publishes—I have not yet read Dr. Robertson's History, to my
shame be it spoken, though I have the honour to know the author.—I
hope the King <HI>will</HI> oblige the Irish Peers with a place in the
procession, as that people seem greatly out of temper; and, I fear, not
without some reason.</P>
<P>I see my friend Dodsley has <HI>let off</HI> his little
<HI>squib</HI> upon the marriage, in the Chronicle. 
<Q REND="inline">"<HI>The King sought a partner,</HI>" &amp;c.</Q>
and last night was brought me, from Baskerville's press, on the same
occasion, very <HI>pompously</HI> printed, the most despi∣cable
Grub-street I ever saw.</P>
<P>I have made some little improvements about my place; have taken
away the wall in front, and made a handsome ring; have extended my path, in
one piece of ground, greatly for the bet∣ter—but the grand water in the
valley will make no figure till next spring.</P>
<P>I have also assisted my friend Hull the come∣dian in
altering the Tragedy of Rosamond; had it brought upon the stage to a full
house at Bir∣mingham, where it was very well received; put Hull into a way of
making an indirect compli∣ment to the present King in the ten last lines of
his Epilogue, which was followed by 
<Q REND="inline">"God save great George," &amp;c.</Q> in a full
chorus of the audi∣ence and actors drawn out abreast upon the stage.</P>
<P>Since this, there has been deposited in my hands a large
collection of Poetry, by a Miss Wheatly of Walsall: many of the pieces
writ∣ten in an excellent and truly classical style; sim∣ple,
sentimental, harmonious, and more correct than I almost ever saw written
by a lady. They will be published, I believe, by subscription, un∣der the
patronage of Lord Dartmouth.</P>
<P>But nothing in the poetical way has pleased me better than a
compliment which I received <PB N="253" REF="280"/> about nine days ago by the
post, under the feigned name <HI>Cotswouldia.</HI>—She must be
some Gloustershire lady that has seen the place; as she raises up a
Fairy in my grove, into whose mouth she puts the compliment. It seems
writ∣ten by somebody of fashion by the style.—Can you form any
conjecture?</P>
<P>There was a Mr. Freeman of Betstow (or some such name) with
two or three ladies in a coach and fix that were here not long before; a very
genteel and polite young man.</P>
<P>I really know not how to stop, when I begin a letter to
<HI>you</HI>; and it is one reason why I look upon the task as too
considerable to be under∣taken at all times. Pray write soon, and believe
me wholly yours and Mrs. Graves's.</P>

<SALUTE>Dear Mr. Graves,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I FIND you will <HI>not</HI> write, unless I give a re∣gular
answer to your letters; and yet, God knows, I have a better excuse for my
delay, than I wish my friend to have for his punctilio—I mean,
indisposition.—Whence it has happened, I cannot say, unless I may
blame these continual east winds; but I have suffered more from the
smiles of spring, than I have really done from the frowns of winter.</P>
<P>Having premised thus much, I lay your letter before me. The
expence of printing a sheet of those commendatory verses at a common
press is eighteen shillings; and at Baskerville's about 
<PB N="254" REF="281"/> three pounds, ten shillings: nor do I mean any
decorations, unless perhaps 
<Q REND="inline">"The King-fisher,"</Q> or 
<Q REND="inline">"View of my Grove,"</Q> which you know, I
<HI>have</HI> engraven ready to <HI>my</HI> hands. So you see that
<HI>this</HI> offering to vanity is not likely to be the most
expensive.</P>
<P>I wish you had bestowed somewhat more at∣tention upon <HI>the
title</HI>; in which <HI>case,</HI> I really be∣lieve the job had been
executed long ago. Pray be so kind as to re-consider it.—Is not 
<Q REND="inline">"The Garland of Friendship"</Q> a little too
quaint? for that, as I remember, was what I proposed.—The
<HI>motto</HI> which you proposed was a very good one; and I think also,
that the addition of the next line would be an improvement to it; 
<Q REND="inline">"et isti er∣rori, nomen virtus posuisset
honestum."</Q> But I do not love <HI>double</HI> mottoes; so, if I admit
this, I must exclude what I proposed; which, to speak the truth, was of
my own invention.</P>
<P>The custom of prefixing commendatory verses to collections of
poetry is now seemingly grown obsolete. Besides, in my case, they would
only shew, that I had <HI>taken</HI> up more fame than my funds would
answer. I return you many thanks for <HI>your</HI> poetical benevolence; but
why do you mention it under the name of <HI>Epigram</HI>? I do not even chuse
that it should have the air of <HI>simile</HI> from the <HI>beginning</HI>:

<Q> 
<L>Lo the tall youth, by partial fate's decree,</L> 
<L>To affluence born, and from restraint set free;</L> 
<L>How pleased he, &amp;c.</L></Q></P>
<P>I have taken <HI>this</HI> and some <HI>other</HI> liberties with
it, and shall insert it among the rest; unless you chuse to
<HI>redeem</HI> it, with something more to your satisfaction; for, to
speak with frank∣ness, I think it better calculated to do <HI>me</HI>
honour than <HI>yourself</HI>; though I could esteem it <HI>good,</HI> if
it <PB N="255" REF="282"/> came from a person whose abilities I respected
less than yours. There is a subject here, which I would recommend to you,
if by so doing I should lay you under no <HI>restraint.</HI> It is my
principal cascade. Its appearance well resem∣bles the playfulness of
infancy; skipping from side to side, with a thousand antic motions,
that answer no other purpose than the mere amuse∣ment of the
proprietor.—Other similitudes, &amp;c. would here occur; 
<Q>Cui enim nascenti faciles arriserunt Musae, &amp;c.</Q> It
then proceeds a few hundred yards, where it <HI>rolls</HI> and <HI>slits
iron</HI> for manufactures of all kinds; resembling the graver toils of
manhood, either in acquiring money, or furnishing the conveni∣encies,
comforts, or ornaments of life: and, in this manner, it proceeds under the name
of The Stour, supplying works for casting, forging, and and shaping iron,
for every civil or military pur∣pose. Perhaps you may not know that my rills
are the principal sources of this river; or that this river supplies
<HI>more</HI> iron-works than almost any single river in the kingdom: for
so my friend Mr. Knight told me.</P>
<P>The Mr. D— you enquire after, and who wrote the
<HI>best</HI> address Sir Robert Walpole ever <HI>received,</HI> is Mr.
Dodington.—Did I never send you a list of all the concealed names in
that Mis∣cellany?—I began to transcribe one from my own set; but
find one part of my list is lost; I however send it, and will piece it
out when I find an opportunity; as I purpose also to give you some
account of our several merits of Dod∣sley's Fables. By the way, do not the
verses to Dr. Cornwallis (now Bishop) affect you sensibly, vol. VI. p.
158?—they do <HI>me,</HI> whenever I read them; and I cannot help
applying them to my∣self. <PB N="256" REF="283"/> I feel somewhat of the
same sensation when I read 
<Q REND="inline">"The Letters of Henry and Fran∣ces;"</Q> in which
(from self-partiality, no doubt) I find myself extremely like Henry.</P>
<P>Pray let me hear, if you please, of Mr. Daven∣port.—I wish
I had learnt to <HI>draw</HI> well in early life.—It would have given me
some very great advantages. Let me hear also much of Mr. Melmoth, who, I
presume, has left you long be∣fore this time. I did once design to have
sent you down my proposals for a subscription, and requested the
favour of <HI>you two</HI> to settle them finally, without any further
reference to myself; but my head and spirits have been too bad to undertake
even a common letter.—What think you of Dr. Lowth's Grammar?—Livie
met him at Mr. Dodsley's, and says, he is well pleased with <HI>our</HI>
frontispiece, &amp;c. to Horace. Livie could not present his book to Lord
Bute, <HI>himself,</HI> on account of my Lord's indisposition. Mr. Dalton
(Dr. Dalton's brother) who teaches the K. to draw, presented it. It seems,
this Dr. Dalton (who gave the drawing of Lord Bute's arms) has lodgings in the
palace, and sees the King every day. <HI>While</HI> Livie was <HI>with</HI>
him, word came that the King was coming into his room; upon which Livie was
sent out another way.—The King asked Dalton, whom he had with
him?—and was answered, an editor of Horace, who had inscribed it to
Lord Bute.—Dalton is to present a copy to the King.</P>
<P>I inclose to you a specimen of the decorated parts of Horace,
with the frontispiece.—The book will be published in a month's time,
when I mean you a copy from those that are allotted to me.</P>
<P>My Lord Bute's arms are unexceptionably well finished.—The
other plates, either through negligence, or the wilfulness of the designer
and <PB N="257" REF="284"/> engraver, have given me infinite trouble and
vexation. However, with about <HI>two-thirds</HI> of my directions observed,
they will, I hope, afford you some pleasure; and discover somewhat more
<HI>beauty</HI> and <HI>spirit</HI> than one commonly finds in such
designs.—Send me your remarks very particularly, I beseech you.</P>

<SALUTE>Dear Mr. Graves,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>DO I really owe you an apology? you who are embarrassed with
such a number of momentous concerns, as hardly allow a fair trial to letters
of mere amusement? Alas! I cannot shelter my long silence under a
supposi∣tion of this kind. I believe, I even <HI>hope,</HI> that you have
disapproved my long neglect; as I can very faithfully assure you, I have
repeatedly done, <HI>myself.</HI> There are certain times and sea∣sons
when I have not either the <HI>power</HI> or the <HI>will</HI> to write; as
Hannibal said about attacking Rome, 
<Q REND="inline">"quandoque memtem non dari, quan∣doque
potestalem."</Q> This being an intellec∣tual kind of <HI>lethargy,</HI> it
would have been at least a friendly office, if you had <HI>rouzed</HI> me, as
you <HI>might</HI> have done, by a supernumerary let∣ter. I never receive a
line from you, but I feel an almost irresistible propensity to answer
it that very instant. Impediments sometimes occur; and, that instant
being neglected, matter is accumulated for a longer letter than I am always
resolute enough to undertake: at the same time, I can never content
myself with uttering one half of what I have to say.—Pray 
<PB N="258" REF="285"/> is not that <HI>good sort of man,</HI> to whom you
allude, a Mr. K—? Let him be ever so good a sort of man in the common
estimation, I dare aver him to be neither an ingenious person nor a candid
critic. There may be fifty or more preferable readings to what are received in
this new Ho∣race: yet he will find a better <HI>text</HI> there <HI>upon the
whole,</HI> than in any one edition before ex∣tant. As to the <HI>beauty</HI>
of <HI>type</HI> and <HI>press-work,</HI> it is too obvious to need
vindication. The accu∣racy of the <HI>latter</HI> almost exceeds what was
ever found in any other book. Then as to the <HI>fron∣tispiece,</HI> it is, I
think, much superior to such as <HI>ordinarily</HI> occur; the
<HI>subject</HI> animated, and well chosen; and the <HI>execution</HI> very
commendable: at least, if we allow for the <HI>nice</HI> touches which it
required, and the <HI>uncommon difficulty</HI> of getting any thing of this
kind done to one's direction.</P>
<P>Mr. Walpole is a lively and ingenious writer; not always accurate in
his determinations, and much less so in his language: too often led away,
by a desire of routing prejudices and de∣stroying giants. And yet there is
no province wherein he appears to more advantage, in <HI>gene∣ral,</HI> than in
throwing new light upon Characters in British History. I wish he would
compose a regular work, making this his principal point. He has, with great
labour, in his Book of Pain∣ters, recorded matter of little importance,
re∣lative to people that were of less. I have a right to be severe, for his
volumes cost me above thirty shillings; yet, where he drops the
<HI>anti∣quarian</HI> in them, his remarks are striking, and worth
perusal.—I have sent for 
<Q REND="inline">"Gesner's Rural Poems,"</Q> and intend to see 
<Q REND="inline">"The Death of Abel;"</Q> though I expect to find
small plea∣sure in this <HI>poetical prose,</HI> unless exquisitely
well tuned.—Thank you for the anecdote of Lord Courtney: a thousand
such sort of things, that <PB N="259" REF="286"/> engage the public
attention, are never capable of penetrating the depth of my retirement.</P>
<P>Mr. Melmoth you will probably see often, as he intends to make
Bath his place of residence.</P>
<P>The <HI>Omphale</HI> you sent me is a most excellent figure, and
I shall wish much to get a good cast of it; at least, when I am able to
afford it.—When I write again, I will give you the best account I can
of <HI>my share</HI> in Dodsley's new Fables; though it will be no easy
matter to speak <HI>separately</HI> of it, with any precision.</P>
<P>And now, I think, I have spoke to most of the articles in your
last letter.—Mr. Dodsley, who says he visited you, would acquaint
you how we divided our time whilst he was here, into two <HI>principal</HI>
parts, 
<Q REND="inline">"l'un à dormir, l'autre à ne rien
faire."</Q> Yet we paid our devoirs to a good deal of genteel company; of which
this season has afforded me at <HI>least</HI> an equal share with any
that went before. I will particularize a few; opening the list with no less
personages than the Duke and Dutchess of Richmond—Mr. Walsh, member
for Worcester—Earl of Bath with Dr. Monson, Mrs. Montague (who wrote
the three last Dialogues printed with Lord Lyt∣telton's) and other company,
from Hagley—Sir Richard Ashley—Mr. Mordaunt—Dr. Charlton
with Mr. Knight—Earl and Countess of North∣ampton—Mr.
Amyand—Lord Plymouth and Sir Harry Parker—Mr. and Mrs. Morrice of
Percefield—Lord Mansfield with Mr. Baron Smythe, Lord Dartmouth and Mr.
Talbot—Marquis of Tavistock and Earl of Ossory—your nephew
Mr. Graves, with Mr. Hopton and one of the senior Proctors of Oxford
—Lord and Lady Dacre—Baron Plessen, gentleman of the bedchamber
to the King of Denmark, with Mr. Wendt his tutor—Lord and Lady Vernon of
Sedbury, with his children, Sir Charles and <PB N="260" REF="287"/> Lady Tynte,
and Mr. Garrick's brother—Mr. and Mrs. Melmoth—Colonel
James—Lady Ward and Lady Uill, with Miss Wrottesley, Miss Pigott,
&amp;c.—Lord Lyttelton, Mr. Lyttel∣ton, and Mr. Rust—Lord and
Lady Dartmouth with Lord and Lady Willoughby de Broke—Mr. Anson of
Shuckburgh with Mr. Stuart the painter and publisher of 
<Q REND="inline">"Athenian Ruins"—</Q>Mr. Pepys and Sir W.
Wheeler's son. Mr. Pitt's nephew, &amp;c.—Colonel Bamfylde with Mr.
Knight's family, &amp;c. &amp;c. I did not imagine my list would have
engrossed so much of my pa∣per, and leave so little room to speak
about the individuals.—Lord M— appeared to me ra∣ther a <HI>man of
wit</HI> than a <HI>man of taste</HI>; Baron Smythe, the reverse—Mr.
and Mrs. Morrice, extremely polite and agreeable people, invited me
pressingly to their habitation; I could not help reflecting on the
singular happiness of Mr. Morrice, to be possessed at once of a
large fortune, one of the finest situations in England, and a wife whose
taste for rural improvements appears even superior to his own; at least,
if the <HI>beauty</HI> of her <HI>person</HI> did not impose upon my
judgement. There are many others whom I would distinguish, if my time or
paper would permit.—I suppose that you and Mr. Dodsley would be
mighty unanimous with regard to the propriety of setting my subscription
on foot—I do not dispute any of your arguments—they tally exactly
with my own opinion; at least, al∣lowing for the higher idea you have of my
pieces than they deserve—the truth is, that I have deferred the
publication too long <HI>already,</HI>—till many of the compositions
will not ap∣pear to the same advantage as before: and till I have not half
the power that I had formerly, to improve them. When I am low-spirited, I
almost shudder at this tremendous contract <PB N="261" REF="288"/> with the
publick; when my spirits are elevated, I see the necessity that you do,
of not losing a moment's time—were you here a week, you would put the
matter upon a footing that was unalterable—Would to God you <HI>were</HI>
here, or any one <HI>like</HI> you! however, it is probable you will
<HI>soon</HI> hear from me again upon this very subject—I
<HI>know</HI> this, that <HI>if</HI> I print at <HI>all,</HI> the
subscription is by no means to be neglected this present winter.—I
have seen our friend Dr. Charlton many times this season; at The
Leasowes; at Mr. Knight's; at his own house; and at my Lord Foley's. This
visit to my Lord Foley's was performed about three weeks ago. I went with
young Knight; and the company of the Doctor and Sir Francis Charlton took off
all restraint, and made the visit perfectly agreeable. My Lord's behaviour
was entirely free and hospitable; and his conversation lively and
entertaining—I must confess, far beyond the idea which I have been
taught to conceive of him.—His table, the most magnificent, I believe,
of any nobleman's for thirty miles round—His park, and Woobery-hill
adjacent, afford views that are either extensive, wild, beautiful, or grand.
The portico before his lodge deserves particular notice—his house
large and commodious, and well furnished; but scarce any of the rooms
<HI>high</HI> enough to stand the test of modern criticism. But what
strikes more than all the rest, is the magnifi∣cence of his
Chapel—which, however, I can∣not stay to describe; for I, this very
<HI>moment,</HI> receive your letter.—After having written so much
before, I can only touch upon some few particulars.—I believe, my
scheme of publica∣tion will proceed in a little time, and that you will
soon hear from me again.—If you can possibly excuse me to Mr.
Davenport, and <PB N="262" REF="289"/> keep me well with him for a week or
fort∣night, I will not fail to write him a respect∣ful letter. I am truly
ashamed of my neglect; but have written more letters within this week than I
have done for a quarter of a year be∣fore.—That there is a faction
forming against Lord B—. I really believe.—The war may suit the
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> world: and the City of Lon∣don
has generally the art to represent the <HI>landed</HI> and <HI>trading</HI>
interest as <HI>precisely</HI> the same thing—But I think there is
a very material dif∣ference; which it would be no way difficult to
demonstrate—at least I am one that cry out, 
<Q>Nulla salus bello: pacem te poseimus omnes.</Q> I am quite
unacquainted with the affair relating to Colonel Wilkes and Lord Bute's
son.—And now (though I mean to write again soon) I will release you
from this unpleasing scrawl.—I beg however that you would not fail to
write to me <HI>directly,</HI> if you can find leisure; being quite impatient
to converse with you, after such a chasm in our correspondence; and
being, with unvariable affection, my dear friend, for ever yours.—Pray my
best respects to Mrs. Graves.</P>

<SALUTE>My dear friend,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>A THOUSAND thanks to you for the very obliging and humorous Poem
which you are so kind to send me. I really think it very ingenious, and,
upon the whole, ex∣tremely correct; although I have taken the li∣berty of
proposing one or two hints for farther improvement. The relation that it
bears to me and my place <HI>may</HI> tend to prejudice my <HI>judgement</HI>;
but I cannot conceive that it requires aught beside <HI>impartiality,</HI> to
relish the beauties of this Poem. I beg I may receive a fair copy in your own
hand, as soon as possible; and I will consider, in the mean time, how
to shew it to the publick in the most advantageous manner. It certainly
does me <HI>honour:</HI> as things are at present circumstanced, it may
<HI>tend</HI> to do me <HI>good</HI>: which I am very sure you would be glad
to see. I am a little ashamed to be so much behind-hand with you, in
favours of <HI>this</HI> and <HI>other</HI> kinds: but I live in hopes there
may come a day, when I shall find occasion to express my gratitude. The
pictures you sent arrived safe on Thursday; and have been since
cleaned, and put up in their places. I can∣not enter upon this subject now;
finding it almost six o'clock at night, and having just received a letter
from Mr. Dodsley, which he requires me to answer by return of post. It
relates to the <HI>scheme</HI> mentioned in his last, which is intended for
my emolument; but which I must not expect to succeed, without
considerable mortification. This <HI>inter nos.</HI>—You must by no
means lay aside the thoughts of <PB N="264" REF="291"/> perfecting
<HI>Edge-hill,</HI> at your leisure. It is pos∣sible that, in order to
keep clear of flattery, I have said less in its favour than I really
<HI>ought</HI>—but I never considered it otherwise than as a Poem
which it was very adviseable for you to com∣pleat, and <HI>finish.</HI> I
am now to desire my best respects to Mrs. Jago, and to bid you an
affec∣tionate adieu.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>The Leasowes, 
<DATE>Jan. 4, 1763.</DATE></DATELINE> 
<SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>MR. G— tells me, that you have done me the honour to lay
some stress upon re∣ceiving a letter from me. Alas! it must be owing
purely to your benevolence, which makes you wish to hear of an absent
friend, and not to any expectations you can reasonably form of entertainment
from his pen. The long letter with which you favoured me was so very lively
as well as ingenious, that I despaired of draw∣ing from my fountains the
vivacity you do from the Bath-waters. But, be this as it will, the vein of
friendship that runs through your letter demands my amplest
acknowledgements; and if you will accept of <HI>such</HI> returns, I
pro∣mise they will be as <HI>hearty</HI> as they are <HI>insipid.</HI></P>
<P>I agree with you, that the first sallies of ima∣gination will
generally prove the most sprightly; <PB N="265" REF="292"/> and that they
will often comprehend the prin∣cipal features of a subject. They are of the
nature of dead-colouring in a portrait; which one sometimes thinks more
spirited than the same performance when finished. And yet a <HI>good</HI>
painter will not <HI>hurt</HI> a portrait by the sub∣sequent labour he
bestows upon it, nor will a <HI>good</HI> writer injure his piece by the
pains he takes to round and perfect it. It must be some de∣fect in the
taste of either that makes his dili∣gence detrimental, or gives occasion
for a stan∣der-by to cry out, 
<Q REND="inline">"Manum de tabula."</Q> I be∣lieve it will appear
upon examination, that works which cost most labour have generally been
thought the <HI>easiest,</HI> and pleased the <HI>longest.</HI> One
cannot, however, deny that there is a sort of persons formed by nature for
<HI>shooting flying,</HI> (which, by the way, I could never <HI>do</HI>) and
that their sallies of imagination are what they can hardly improve by any
future pains. These may be called men of wit and fire, but it is the union of
<HI>taste</HI> with these that constitutes fine writing. True taste
will never stiffen or overcharge any performance: it will rather be employed
to smooth, simplify, and give that ease on which <HI>grace</HI> depends.
One can as little deny that there are <HI>kinds</HI> of writing which have a
better chance than others to succeed without much labour, which start forth
mature at <HI>first,</HI> as Pallas did from the brain of Jupiter. Works of
<HI>humour</HI> are often of this sort; and there are many instances in
Butler's Hudibras. Yet I think the humour of <HI>Swift</HI> was greatly owing
to a judicious <HI>revisal.</HI> Pardon me, my dear friend, for this tedious
discussion, which you little thought of bringing upon yourself by the
obliging hint you gave concerning those verses upon Venus. I do acknowledge
that an additional stanza there, containing a reflexion on Chinese
architecture, were better laid aside. <PB N="266" REF="293"/> It seemed to
me one of the 
<Q REND="inline">"splendi da pec∣cata,"</Q> that might be a little
<HI>popular</HI> at this <HI>time</HI>; and has, therefore, for this
season, ap∣peared on a board by the side of the Venus. We, who cannot
erect fresh temples, or even add a new garden-seat every spring, are
obliged to make the most we can of a new and toler∣able copy of verses,
that costs us <HI>thought</HI> in∣stead of <HI>money</HI>; and even at a
pinch to piece out a dull scene with duller poetry: how else could I keep
my place in countenance, so near the pompous piles of Hagley? And yet there
are few <HI>fashionable</HI> visitants that do not shew an
<HI>affection</HI> for the little Amoret, as much as they admire the stately
Sacharissa—
<Q REND="inline">"plerumque gratae <HI>divitibus vices.</HI>"</Q> I
have often considered why those possessed of palaces yet esteem a
root-house or a cottage as a desirable object in their gardens.—Is it
not from having experi∣enced the imperfection of happiness in higher life,
that they are led to <HI>conceive</HI> it more com∣pleat beneath a roof of
straw, where, perhaps, it may really be as defective as in the apart∣ments of
a King or a Minister?—A thousand thanks to you and Mrs. Davenport for
the ac∣commodations you so kindly offer me. Expe∣rience will no more suffer
me to question the <HI>cordiality</HI> than the politeness of your
reception. What an amusing picture have you given of Bath! pleasures
carried to the utmost height, and opiates ready when one is cloyed with
pleasures! And yet, let me confess a truth, you have <HI>lightly</HI>
touched upon those <HI>very</HI> articles, which would prove to me the most
<HI>specifically</HI> pleasing. For can any temptation be stronger, than
to say that <HI>you</HI> reside there? and does not my friend G— reside
at Claverton, of whose genius and friendship I have had proofs
these twenty years past? and have you not Mr. Webb, and now Mr. Melmoth, to
make Bath <HI>enviable</HI> <PB N="267" REF="294"/> for the residence of
literature? What a joy would it afford me to go on a party with you to
Percefield, whither Mr. and Mrs. Morrice gave me the most pressing
invitations!—These surely are pleasures of which—I
<HI>hope</HI> one day to partake.</P>
<P>My health, generally bad in winter and spring, has hitherto been
tolerable. The <HI>in∣fluenza</HI> of last spring continued to depress me
half the summer. Would you think the verses I inclosed were written on
that occasion by a young journeyman shoemaker; and one that lives at the
village of Rowley, near me? He considered my disorder in somewhat too
<HI>grave</HI> a light, as I did not think my life endangered by it; but,
allowing for this, and the <HI>partiality</HI> he shews <HI>me,</HI> you will
think the lines pretty extra∣ordinary for one of <HI>his occupation.</HI> They
are not, however, the <HI>only,</HI> or, perhaps, the <HI>chief</HI>
specimens of his genius; and yet, before he came to me, his principal
knowledge was drawn from <HI>Magazines.</HI> For these two or three years
past, I have lent him Classics, and other books in English. You see,
to <HI>him,</HI> I am a great Mae∣cenas; although you and my friend expect me
to become an author by subscription.—On this head I will say no
more at <HI>present,</HI> than that I am infinitely obliged by your extreme
friendly offers. My friend G—, who knows my sen∣timents, has
sometimes the honour of waiting on you; I ought not, therefore, after this
tedi∣ous epistle, to begin to trouble you with a written explanation of them.
Believe me, dear Sir, with my most respectful compliments to Mrs.
Davenport,</P>

<SALUTE>Dear Mr. Jago,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>MY last letter must have been confused, and the arrival of it,
I fear, uncertain.</P>
<P>The hare and birds in one of the pictures which you sent me, I
think, are well. The other parts of it indifferent. They grey hound worst of
all. The portrait is by no means equal to its companion, either in beauty of
the person, or skill of the painter; yet it matches so well with the
other, that I find my parlour very much em∣bellished by it. Pardon the
freedom with which I criticise your present; and accept once more my very
thankful acknowledgements.</P>
<P>I am truly glad to find so worthy a Nobleman, and so warm a
friend of yours, as my Lord Willoughby is, made a Lord of the Bed-cham∣ber.</P>
<P>I have heard nothing since I wrote last in re∣gard to
<HI>my</HI> affair; though I expect to do so every day. I have such a tribe
of humours and pecu∣liarities, that it is easier to make me rich than to make
me happy; and ten to one that the favour will not be conferred without
disgusting some of these said humours, &amp;c. However, one must
make the best of it; and reflect, that mortifica∣tions in one place may
preclude mortifications in another.</P>
<P>I go to-morrow, by appointment, to Enville; where I may probably
stay till Saturday. I have wished most heartily for a copy of your Fable
to take with me; but Dodsley has not yet returned that I sent him. Pray
consider my proposed al∣terations rather as hints than real improvements,
and let me have a copy as soon you can. I wrote my criticism over twice,
and know not whether I sent the best or the worst copy; so I send the
<PB N="269" REF="296"/> other, though perhaps much the same. I forgot to
particularize many shining parts in your little Fable, that are either
elegant or humourous: of the former sort, nothing could be happier than what
you say about H—: as it touches, in the <HI>gentlest</HI> manner, on
a possible truth, which, if expressed rather than implied, might not be
al∣together inoffensive. This beauty is produced by substituting H— instead
of L—, the place in∣stead of the proprietor.</P>
<P>I have lately read 
<Q REND="inline">"The Death of Abel."—</Q>It is not void of
merit; but might have been made much more pathetic by a more simple and
prosaic style.</P>
<P>I desire my best respects to Mrs. Jago and your
family.—May not I see you here this Christmas? as I wish to do,
because it is the season present; and not that I am not at all times
and at all sea∣sons most unseignedly glad to wait upon you, and most
affectionately your ever faithful ser∣vant: 
<Q> 
<L>Tecum etenim longos memini consumere soles,</L>

<P>I AM suspicious that my letters (of which I have sent two) do
not reach you by the way <PB N="270" REF="297"/> of Warwick. This is meant as an
experiment whether they will arrive by way of Southam. It is meant withall to
remind you of perfecting your little Fable, and dispatching it to me as

family separates, or leaves Enville; by whom, I am sure, it would be
admired.</P>
<P>I am just returned from a visit which I made there, and four or
five days passed very happily. At coming away, I shewed my Lord two or
three of Mr. D—'s last letters, which laid open to him the scheme
that was carrying on for me. I requested also, if there should be
occasion (which there possibly might <HI>not</HI>) that he would allow me
the honour of being known to him. He said, 
<Q REND="inline">"he was glad to find what was going forward; and had
long wished to see something of that sort begun before: that he
should be in town, I think, in February; and would do me any service in his
power. He desired me also to acquaint Mr. D— (in allusion to the
latter's uncertainty about my Lord's political connexi∣ons) that he thought it
the duty of every honest man to support the present Government; and that
he should continue his regard for the Mini∣ster so long as he saw
nothing in his measures that was prejudicial to his Country."</Q></P>
