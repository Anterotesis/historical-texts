<BYLINE>By the late Mr. <HI>CUNNINGHAM.</HI></BYLINE>
<LG>
<L>O'ER moorlands and mountains, rude, barren, and bare,</L>
<L>As wearied and wilder'd I roam,</L>
<L>A gentle young shepherdess sees my despair,</L>
<L>And leads me o'er lawns to her home;</L>
<L>Yellow sheaves from rich Ceres her cottage had crown'd,</L>
<L>Green rushes were strew'd on the floor,</L>
<L>Her casement sweet woodbines crept wantonly round,</L>
<L>And deck'd the sod seats at the door.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>We sat ourselves down to a cooling repast,</L>
<L>Fresh fruits, and she cull'd me the best;</L>
<L>Whilst thrown from my guard, by some glances she cast,</L>
<L>Love slily stole into my breast:</L>
<L>I told my soft wishes, she sweetly reply'd.</L>
<L>(Ye virgins, her voice was divine!)</L>
<L>I've rich one's rejected, and great ones deny'd,</L>
<L>Yet take me, fond shepherd, I'm thine.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Her air was so modest, her aspect so meek,</L>
<L>So simple, tho' sweet, were her charms;</L>
<L>I kiss'd the ripe roses that glow'd on her cheek,</L>
<L>And lock'd the dear maid in my arms:</L>
<L>Now jocund together we tend a few sheep,</L>
<L>And if on the banks by the stream,</L>
<L>Reclin'd on her bosom I sink into sleep,</L>
<L>Her image still softens my dream.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Together we range o'er the slow-rising hills,</L>
<L>Delighted with pastoral views;</L>
<L>Or rest on the rock, whence the streamlet distils,</L>
<L>And mark out new themes for my muse.</L>
<L>To pomp, or proud titles, she ne'er did aspire,</L>
<L>The damsel's of humble descent;</L>
<L>The cottager Peace is well known for her sire,</L>
<L>The shepherds have nam'd her CONTENT.</L>
