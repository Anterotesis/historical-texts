<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>S I have assumed the character of CENSOR GENERAL, I
shall follow the example of the old Roman Censor; the first part of
whose duty was to review the people, and distribute them into their
several Divi∣sions: I shall therefore enter upon my office, by taking a
cursory survey of what is usually called <HI>The</HI> TOWN. In this I
shall not confine myself to the exact method of a Geographer, but carry the
reader from one quarter to another, as it may suit my convenience, or best
contri∣bute to his entertainment.</P>
<P>WHEN a Comedian, celebrated for his excellence in the part of
Shylock, first undertook that character, he made daily visits to the center
of business, the 'Change, and the adjacent Coffee-houses; that by a
frequent intercourse and conversation with 
<Q REND="inline">"the unforeskinn'd race,"</Q> he might
ha∣bituate himself to their air and deportment. A like desire 
<PB N="2" REF="3"/> of penetrating into the most secret springs of action
in these people, has often led Me there; but I was never more diverted than
at <HI>Garraway</HI>'s a few days before the draw∣ing of the lottery. I not
only could read Hope, Fear, and all the various passions excited by a love
of gain, strongly pictured in the faces of those who came to buy; but I
re∣marked with no less delight, the many little artifices made use of to
allure adventurers, as well as the visible altera∣tions in the looks of the
sellers, according as the demand for tickets gave occasion to raise or
lower their price. So deeply were the countenances of these Bubble-Brokers
im∣pressed with an attention to the main chance, and their minds seemed
so dead to all other sensations, that one might almost doubt, where
money is out of the case, whether a Jew 
<Q REND="inline">"has eyes, hands, organs, dimensions,
senses, af∣fections, passions."</Q></P>
<P>FROM <HI>Garraway</HI>'s it is but a short step to a gloomy
class of mortals, not less intent on gain than the Stock∣jobber: I mean the
dispensers of life and death, who flock together, like birds of prey
watching for carcases, at <HI>Bat∣son</HI>'s. I never enter this place, but
it serves as a <HI>memento mori</HI> to me. What a formal assemblage of
sable suits, and tremen∣dous perukes! I have often met here a most
intimate ac∣quaintance, whom I have scarce known again; a sprightly young
fellow, with whom I have spent many a jolly hour; but being just dubb'd a
Graduate in Physick, he has gain'd such an entire conquest over the
risible muscles, that he hardly vouchsafes at any time to smile. I have
heard him harangue, with all the oracular importance of a veteran, on the
possibility of CANNING's subsisting for a whole month on a few bits
of bread; and he is now preparing a treatise, in which will be set forth a
new and infallible method to prevent the spreading of the plague from
<HI>France</HI> into <HI>England. Batson</HI>'s has been reckon'd the seat
of solemn stupidity: yet is it not totally devoid of taste and common
sense. They have among them Physicians who can cope with the most
eminent Lawyers or Divines; and Critics, who can relish the <HI>sal
volatile</HI> of a witty composition, or <PB N="3" REF="4"/> determine how
much <HI>fire</HI> is requisite to <HI>sublimate</HI> a tragedy
<HI>secundùm artem.</HI></P>
<P>EMERGING from these dismal regions, I am glad to breath the
pure air in St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s Coffee-house: where (as I profess the
highest veneration for our Clergy) I can∣not contemplate the magnificence of
the cathedral without reflecting on the abject condition of those 
<Q REND="inline">"tatter'd crapes,"</Q> who are said to ply
here for an occasional Burial or Sermon, with the same regularity as the
happier drudges, who salute us with the cry of 
<Q REND="inline">"coach sir,"</Q> or 
<Q REND="inline">"chair your honour."</Q></P>
<P>And here my Publisher would not forgive me, was I to leave the
neighbourhood without taking notice of the <HI>Chapter</HI> Coffee-house,
which is frequented by those en∣couragers of literature, and (as they are
stiled by an emi∣nent Critic) 
<Q REND="inline">"not the worst judges of merit,"</Q> the
Book∣sellers. The conversation here naturally turns upon the newest
publications, but their criticisms are something sin∣gular. When they
say a <HI>good</HI> book, they do not mean to praise the style or
sentiment, but the quick and extensive sale of it. That book in the
phrase of the CONGER is best, which sells most; and if the demand for
QUARLES should be greater than for POPE, he would have the highest place on
the rubric post. There are also many parts of every work liable to their
remarks, which fall not within the notice of less accurate observers. A few
nights ago I saw one of these gentlemen take up a Sermon, and after
seeming to peruse it for some time with great attention, he declared 
<Q REND="inline">"it was very good <HI>English.</HI>"</Q> The
reader will judge whether I was most surprised or diverted, when I
discovered, that he was not commending the purity and elegance of the
diction, but the beauty of the <HI>type,</HI> which, it seems, is known
a∣mong the printers by that appellation. We must not however think the
members of the CONGER strangers to the deeper parts of literature; for as
Carpenters, Smiths, Masons, and all Handicraftsmen smell of the trade
they labour at, Book∣sellers take a peculiar turn from their connexions with
books and authors. The character of the Bookseller is commonly 
<PB N="4" REF="5"/> formed on the writers in his service. Thus one is a
poli∣tician or a deist; another affects humour, or aims at turns of wit and
repartee; while a third perhaps is grave, moral, and sententious.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Temple</HI> is the barrier that divides the City and
Suburbs, and the gentlemen who reside there seem influ∣enced by the
situation of the place they inhabit. Tem∣plers are, in general, a kind of
citizen-courtiers. They aim at the air and mien of the drawing-room, but the
holiday smartness of a prentice, heightened with some additional touches
of the rake or coxcomb, betrays itself in every thing they do. The
<HI>Temple</HI> however is stock'd with it's peculiar beaus, wits, poets,
critics, and every character in the gay world. And it is a thousand pities,
that so pretty a society should be disgraced with a few dull fellows,
who can submit to puzzle themselves with Cases and Reports, and have not
taste enough to follow the genteel method of studying the law.</P>
<P>I SHALL now, like a true Student of the <HI>Temple,</HI> hurry
from thence to <HI>Covent-Garden,</HI> the acknowledg'd region of gallan∣try,
wit, and criticism; and hope to be excused for not stop∣ping at
<HI>George</HI>'s in my way, as the <HI>Bedford</HI> affords a greater variety
of nearly the same characters. This Coffee-house is every night crowded
with men of parts. Almost every one you meet is a polite scholar and a wit.
Jokes and <HI>bon mots</HI> are echo'd from box to box; every branch of
literature is critically exa∣mined, and the merit of every production of the
press, or performance at the theatres, weighed and determined. This school
(to which I am myself indebted for a great part of my education, and in
which, though unworthy, I am now ar∣rived at the honour of being a public
lecturer) has bred up many authors, to the amazing entertainment and
instruction of their readers. <HI>Button</HI>'s, the grand archetype of the
<HI>Bed∣ford,</HI> was frequented by <HI>Addison, Steele, Pope,</HI> and the
rest of that celebrated set, who flourished at the beginning of this
century, and was regarded with just deference on ac∣count of the real
geniusses who frequented it. But we can now boast men of superior
abilities; men, who without any one <PB N="5" REF="6"/> acquired excellence, by
the mere dint of an happy assurance, can exact the same tribute of
veneration, and receive it as due to the illustrious characters, the
Scribblers, Players, Fidlers, Gamblers, that make so large a part of the
com∣pany at the <HI>Bedford.</HI></P>
<P>NOW, since Mr. MACKLIN is not yet prepared to receive us, I
shall take leave of <HI>Covent-Garden,</HI> and desire the Reader's company
to <HI>White</HI>'s. Here (as <HI>Vanbrugh</HI> says of <HI>Locket</HI>'s) 
<Q REND="inline">"He may have a dish no bigger than a saucer,
that shall cost him fifty shillings."</Q> The great people, who frequent
this place, do not interrupt their politer amusements, like the wretches at
<HI>Garraway</HI>'s, with business, any farther than to go down to
Westminster one Sessions to vote for a Bill, and the next to repeal it.
Nor do they trouble themselves with literary debates, as at the
<HI>Bedford.</HI> Learn∣ing is beneath the notice of a Man of Quality. They
employ themselves more fashionably at whist for the trifle of a
thousand pounds the rubber, or by making bets on the lye of the day.</P>
<P>FROM this very genteel place the Reader must not be
surprised, if I should convey him to a Cellar, or a common
Porter-house. For as it is my province to delineate, and re∣mark on mankind
in general, whoever becomes my disciple must not refuse to follow me from
the <HI>King's-Arms</HI> to the <HI>Goose and Gridiron,</HI> and be content
to climb after me up to an Author's garret, or give me leave to introduce him
to a Route. In my present cursory view of the TOWN I have indeed confined
myself principally to Coffee-houses, tho' I constantly visit all places
that afford any matter for specula∣tion. I am a Scotchman at
<HI>Forrester</HI>'s, a Frenchman at <HI>Slaughter</HI>'s, and at the
<HI>Cocoa-Tree</HI> I am — an ENGLISHMAN. At the <HI>Robin Hood</HI> I am
a Politician, a Logician, a Geo∣metrician, a Physician, a Metaphysician, a
Casuist, a Mo∣ralist, a Theologist, a Mythologist, or any
thing—but an Atheist. Wherever the WORLD is, I am. You will therefore
hear of me sometimes at the Theatres, sometimes perhaps at the Opera; nor
shall I think the exhibitions of <PB N="4" REF="7"/> <HI>Sadler's Wells,</HI>
or the Little Theatre in the <HI>Haymarket,</HI> be∣neath my notice; but may
one day or other give a dissertation upon <HI>Tumbling,</HI> or (if they
should again become popular) a critique on <HI>Dogs</HI> and
<HI>Monkeys.</HI></P>
<P>THOUGH the Town is the walk I shall general∣ly appear in, let
it not be imagined that Vice and Folly will shoot up unnoticed in the
Country. My cou∣sin VILLAGE has undertaken that province, and will send me
the freshest advices of every fault or foible that takes root there. But as
it is my chief ambition to please and instruct the Ladies, I shall
embrace every opportunity of devoting my labours to their service: and I may
with justice congratulate myself upon the happiness of living in an age,
when the female part of the world are so studious to find employment for a
CENSOR.</P>
<P>THE character of Mr. TOWN is, I flatter myself, too well known
to need an explanation. How far, and in what sense, I propose to be a
CONNOISSEUR, the learned reader will gather from my general Motto: 
<Q> 
<L>—Non de villis domibusve alienis,</L> 
<L>Nec male necne Lepos saltet; sed quod magis ad nos</L> 
<L>Pertinet et nescire malum est, agitamus.</L> 
<BIBL>HOR.</BIBL></Q> As CRITIC and CENSOR GENERAL, I shall
take the liberty to animadvert on every thing that appears to me vicious or
ridiculous; always endeavouring 
<Q REND="inline">"to hold, as 'twere, the mirrour up to Nature,
to shew Virtue her own feature, Scorn her own image, and the very age and
body of the Time his form and pressure."</Q></P>

by sup∣porting the character of CONNOISSEUR in it's usual sense, I
might have obtained very considerable salaries from the principal

of this ca∣pital business of TASTE, and how much reputation, as well as

very well know, that the discovery of a new <HI>Zoophyte,</HI> or species
of the <HI>Polype,</HI> would be as valuable as that of the <HI>Longitude.</HI>
The Cabi∣nets of the Curious would furnish out matter for my Essays more

shall not speak too proudly of my <PB N="9" REF="10"/> travels; but as my
predecessor, the SPECTATOR, has re∣commended himself by having made a
trip to <HI>Grand Cairo</HI> to take measure of a Pyramid, I assure my
Reader that I have climb'd Mount <HI>Vesuvio</HI> in the midst of it's
eruptions, and dug some time underground in the ruins of

<P>I SHALL always be sollicitous to procure the esteem of so

sensible, could I any way merit it by my labours, how much more important
the name of Mr. TOWN would appear, dignified with the addition of F. R. S. or
<HI>Member of the Society of Antiquarians.</HI> I therefore take this early
opportunity of obliging the curious with a letter from a very eminent
personage, who, as well as myself, is lately become a CONNOISSEUR, and is
known to have gone a∣broad for no other purpose than to <HI>buy
Pictures.</HI></P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>To Mr. **** ******.</HEAD>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE hurry in which I left <HI>England</HI> must have
con∣vinced you how much I was in earnest, when I talked of making a valuable
collection of Pictures. By my fre∣quent attendance on sales, I already know
almost as much of Painting as I do of the Funds; and can talk as learnedly of
Light and Shade, Figure, Proportion, Drapery, &amp;c. as of the rise and fall
of Stocks. I have however been very much embarrassed in getting together a
collection suitable to the religion I profess. The famous Painters were
most of them such bigots to their own way of thinking, that they have
scarce left any thing behind them but <HI>Holy Families, dead Christs,</HI>
and <HI>Madonas</HI>; subjects which to <PB N="10" REF="11"/> Me and my Tribe
are odious and abominable. A Pic∣ture, since it has the property of being the
language of all mankind, should never be particular in it's subject; but we
should paint, as the <HI>English</HI> are taught to pray, 
<Q REND="inline">"for all Jews, Turks, Infidels and
Hereticks."</Q></P>
<P>WHEN I have made the tour of <HI>Italy,</HI> I will send you
a complete list of all my purchases: in the mean time, the following
short specimen will enable you to judge of my precautions in selecting
Pieces suitable to my character, and not offensive to my principles.</P>
<P>THE first that I bought was "the Elevation of the GOLDEN
CALF." This I shall set up in the <HI>Royal Ex∣change,</HI> as a typical
representation of myself, to be wor∣shipp'd by all Brokers, Insurers,
Scriveners, and the whole fraternity of Stock-jobbers.</P>
<P>THE second is "the Triumph of GIDEON." This I intended, if a
late project in favour of our brethren had not miscarried, to have been hung
up in St. <HI>Stephen</HI>'s Chapel, as a memorial of our victory over the
Uncir∣cumcised.</P>
<P>THE third and fourth are "PETER denying his Ma∣ster," and
"JUDAS betraying him for thirty pieces of silver;" both which I design as
presents to our two worthy friends the B—s of — and —.</P>
<P>THE next which I shall mention to you, deserves
parti∣cular notice; and this is "the Prophet of <HI>Nazareth</HI> himself,
conjuring the Devil into an Herd of Swine." From this piece, when I return to
<HI>England,</HI> I intend to have a Print engraved; being very proper to be
had in all <HI>Jewish</HI> fami∣lies, as a necessary preservative
against Pork, and Chri∣stianity.</P>

co∣lours.—The New Jerusalem, in perspective.—Some Ruins of the
Temple.—A Publican at the Receipt of Custom.—and—a SAMPSON
in miniature.</P>
<P>BESIDES these, I have employ'd an ingenious artist here to
execute a Design of my own. It is a picture of FORTUNE, not standing (as in
the common stile) upon a kind of Cart∣wheel, but on the two Wheels of the
Lottery; with a represen∣tation of a Net cast over the lesser
Engrossers of Tickets, while a CHIEF MANAGER is breaking his way thro' the
Meshes.</P>
<P>I MUST not forget to tell you, that I have pick'd up an
infamous Portrait, by an English hand, call'd <HI>Shylock</HI>; with the
following inscription under it, taken I suppose from, the <HI>London
Evening Post,</HI> or that impudent FOOL the <HI>Gazetteer</HI>;

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">W</SEG>E Writers of Essays, or (as they are termed) Periodical
Papers, justly claim to ourselves a place among the modern improvers of
li∣terature. Neither <HI>Bentley</HI> nor <HI>Burman,</HI> nor any equally
sagacious Commentator, has been able to discover the least traces of any
similar produc∣tions among the Ancients: except we can suppose, that the
History of <HI>Thucydides</HI> was retailed weekly in six-penny numbers;
that <HI>Seneca</HI> dealt out his Morality every Saturday; or that
<HI>Tully</HI> wrote Speeches and Philosophical Disquisitions, whilst
<HI>Virgil</HI> and <HI>Horace</HI> clubb'd together to furnish the Poetry
for a <HI>Roman</HI> Magazine.</P>
<P>THERE is a word indeed, by which we are fond of
distinguishing our works, and for which we must confess 
<PB N="14" REF="19"/> ourselves indebted to the <HI>Latin.</HI> Myself, and
every petty Journalist, affect to dignify our hasty performances by
stiling them LUCUBRATIONS: by which we mean, if we mean any thing, that as
the day is too short for our labours, we are obliged to call in the
assistance of the night: not to mention the modest insinuation, that
our compositions are so correct, that, like the Orations of
<HI>Demosthenes,</HI> they may be said to <HI>smell of the lamp.</HI> We
would be understood to follow the directions of the <HI>Roman</HI>
Satirist, 
<Q REND="inline">"to grow pale by the midnight candle;"</Q>
though perhaps, as our own Satirist expresses it, we may be thought 
<Q> 
<L>"Sleepless ourselves to give our readers
sleep."</L></Q> But, as a relief from the fatigue of so many restless
hours, we have frequently <HI>gone to sleep</HI> for the benefit of the
public: and surely we, whose labours are confined to a sheet and half,
may be indulged in taking a nap now and then, since a modern DREAMER has
outdone even BUNYAN in stile and sentiment, and pompously dozed through
an whole Octavo.</P>
<P>AFTER this preface, the reader will not be surprized if I take
the liberty to relate a Dream of my own. It is usual on these occasions
to be lulled to sleep by some book; and most of my brethren pay that
compliment to <HI>Virgil</HI> or <HI>Shakespeare:</HI> but as I could never
discover any opiate quali∣ties in those authors, I chose to slumber
over some modern performance. I must beg to be excused from mentioning
particulars, as I would not provoke the resentment of my cotemporaries:
Nobody will imagine, that I dipt into any of our modern Novels, or took up any
of our late Trage∣dies.—Let it suffice, that I presently fell fast
asleep.</P>
<P>I FOUND myself transported in an instant to the shore of
an immense sea, covered with innumerable vessels and tho' 
<PB N="15" REF="20"/> many of them suddenly disappeared every minute, I
saw others continually launching forth, and pursuing the same course.
The Seers of Visions, and Dreamers of Dreams, have their organs of sight
so considerably improved, that they can take in any object, however
distant or minute. It is not therefore to be wonder'd at, that I could
discern every∣thing distinctly, though the waters before me were of the
deepest black.</P>
<P>WHILE I stood contemplating this amazing scene, one of
those good-natured <HI>Genii,</HI> who never fail making their appearance to
extricate Dreamers from their difficulties, rose from the sable stream,
and planted himself at my elbow. His complexion was of the darkest hue, not
unlike the <HI>Daemons</HI> of a printing-house; his jetty beard shone like
the bristles of a blacking-brush; on his head he wore a Turbant of Imperial
Paper; and 
<Q> 
<L>"There hung a Calf-skin on his rev'rend limbs,"</L></Q>
which was gilt on the back, and faced with robings of <HI>Morocco,</HI>
letter'd (like a Rubric-post) with the names of the most eminent authors.
In his right hand he bore a printed scroll, which from the marginal
corrections I ima∣gin'd to be a Proof-sheet; and in his left he waved the
Quill of a Goose.</P>
<P>HE immediately accosted me.— 
<Q REND="inline">"TOWN, said he, I am the <HI>Genius</HI> who
is destined to conduct you thro' these turbulent waves. The sea that you
now behold is <HI>The</HI> OCEAN <HI>of</HI> INK. Those towers, at a great
distance, whose bases are founded upon rocks, and whose tops seem
lost in the clouds, are situated in <HI>The</HI> ISLES <HI>of</HI> FAME.
Contiguous to these, you may discern by the glittering of its golden
sands <HI>The</HI> COAST <HI>of</HI> GAIN, which leads to a fertile and rich
country. All the vessels, which <PB N="16" REF="21"/> are yonder sailing
with a fair wind on the main sea, are making towards one or other of these:
but you will ob∣serve, that on their first setting-out they were
irresistibly drawn into <HI>The</HI> EDDIES <HI>of</HI> CRITICISM, where
they were obliged to encounter the most dreadful tempests and hurricanes.
In these dangerous streights you see with what violence every bark is
tost up and down; some go to the bottom at once; others, after a faint
struggle, are beat to pieces; many are much damaged; while a few by sound
planks and tight rigging are enabled to weather the storm."</Q></P>
<P>AT this sight I started back with horror; and the
re∣membrance still dwells so strong upon my fancy, that I even now
imagine the Torrent of Criticism bursting in upon me, and ready to
overwhelm me in an instant.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">"Cast a look, resumed my Instructor, on
that vast Lake divided into two parts, which lead to yonder magnificent
structures, erected by the <HI>Tragic</HI> and <HI>Comic Muse.</HI> There
you may observe many trying to force a passage without chart or
compass. Some have been overset by crowding too much sail, and others
have founder'd by carrying too much ballast. An <HI>Arcadian</HI> vessel
(the master an <HI>Irish∣man)</HI> was, thro' contrary squalls, scarce
able to live nine days: but you see that light <HI>Italian</HI> Gondola,
<HI>Gli Amanti Gelosi,</HI> skims along pleasantly before the wind, and
out∣strips the painted Frigates of her country, <HI>Didone</HI> and
<HI>Artaserse.</HI> Observe that triumphant Squadron, to whose flag all
the others pay homage. Most of them are ships of the first rate, and were
fitted out many years ago. Tho' somewhat irregular in their make, and but
little conform∣able to the exact rules of art, they will ever continue the
pride and glory of these seas: for, as it is remarked by 
<PB N="17" REF="22"/> the present Laureat in his Prologue to <HI>Papal
Tyranny,</HI></Q> 
<Q> 
<L>"<HI>Shakespeare,</HI> whose art no play-wright cou'd
excell;</L> 
<L>"Has launch'd us fleets of plays, and built them
well."</L></Q></P>
<P>The <HI>Genius</HI> then bad me turn my eye, where the water
seemed to foam with perpetual agitation. 
<Q REND="inline">"That, said he, is the strong CURRENT
<HI>of</HI> POLITICS, often fatal to those who venture on it."</Q> I could
not but take notice of a poor wretch on the opposite shore, fasten'd by
the ears to a terrible machine. This the <HI>Genius</HI> informed me was the
memorable DEFOE, set up there as a Land-mark, to prevent future mariners from
splitting on the same rock.</P>
<P>TO this turbulent prospect succeeded objects of a more
placid nature. In a little creek winding thro' flow'ry meads and shady
groves, I descried several gilded Yachts and Plea∣sure-Boats, all of them
keeping due time with their silver oars, and gliding along the smooth,
even, calm, regularly-flowing RIVULETS <HI>of</HI> RHYME. Shepherds and
Shepherdesses play'd on the banks; the sails were gently swelled with
the soft breezes of amorous Sighs, and little Loves sported in the silken
cordage.</P>
<P>MY attention was now called off from these pacific scenes to
an obstinate engagement between several ships distinguish'd from all
others by bearing the <HI>Holy Cross</HI> for their Colours. These, the
<HI>Genius</HI> told me, were employed in the <HI>Holy War</HI> of
<HI>Religious Controversy</HI>; and he pointed out to me a few
<HI>Corsairs</HI> in the service of the <HI>Infidels,</HI> some∣times
aiding one party, sometimes siding with the other, as might best
contribute to the general confusion.</P>
<P>IT were needless to enumerate many other particulars that
engaged my notice. Among the rest was a large Fleet of Annotators,
<HI>Dutch</HI>-built, which sailed very heavy, were <PB N="18" REF="23"/>
often a-ground, and continually ran foul on each other. The whole Ocean, I
also found, was infested by Pyrates, who ransacked every rich vessel
that came in their way. Most of these were endeavouring to make the
<HI>Coast of Gain</HI> by hanging out False Colours, or by forging their
Pass-ports, and pretending to be freighted by the most reputable
Traders.</P>
<P>MY eyes were at last fix'd, I know not how, on a spa∣cious
Channel running thro' the midst of a great City. I felt such a secret
impulse at this sight, that I could not help enquiring particularly about
it. 
<Q REND="inline">"The discovery of that Passage, said the
<HI>Genius,</HI> was first made by one <HI>Bicker∣staff,</HI> in the good
ship call'd <HI>The</HI> TATLER, and who af∣terwards embarked in the
SPECTATOR and GUARDIAN. These have been followed since by a numerous
shoal of little Sloops, Skiffs, Hoys, and Cock-boats, which have been most
of them wreck'd in the attempt; and thither also must your course be
directed."</Q> At this instant the <HI>Genius</HI> suddenly snatch'd me
up in his arms, and plunged me headlong into the inky flood. While I lay
gasping and struggling beneath the waves, methought I heard a familiar
voice calling me by my name; which awaking me, I with pleasure recollected
the features of the <HI>Genius</HI> in those of my Publisher, who was
standing by my bed side, and had called upon me for Copy.</P>

</TEXT></Q>
<P>I MAY perhaps take a future opportunity of enlarging on this
very important subject, the MARRIAGE-BILL; but shall at present oblige
the ladies by celebrating an Order of Females lately sprung up amongst us,
usually distinguish'd by the denomination of DEMI-REPS;—a word not
to be found in any of our Dictionaries.</P>
<P>THIS Order, which seems daily encreasing upon us, was
first instituted by some ladies eminent for their public spirit, with a
view of raising their half of the species to a level with the other in the
unbounded licence of their enjoy∣ments. By this artifice the most open
violation of modesty takes the name of innocent freedom and gaiety; and as
long as the last failing remains a secret, the lady's honour is
spotless and untainted. In a word, a DEMI-REP is a lady whom every body
thinks what no body chuses to call her.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="26"/>IT is absolutely necessary that every
lady of this Order should be married. Custom has given a certain charm to
wedlock, which changes the colour of our actions, and renders that behaviour
not improper, which in a state of celibacy would be accounted indecent and
scandalous. As to the Promises made in marriage 
<Q REND="inline">"to love, honour and obey,"</Q> custom has
made Them also merely ceremonial, and in fact as little binding as the
wedding-ring, which may be put on or pulled off at pleasure.</P>
<P>RELIGIOUS and political writers have both for different
reasons endeavoured to encourage frequent marriages: but this Order, if it
maintains it's ground, will more certainly promote them. How inviting must
such a state appear to a woman of spirit! An <HI>English</HI> wife with
all the indiscre∣tions of a girl may assume more than the privileges of a
woman, may trifle publicly with the beaux and smarts, introduce them to her
toilette, and fix it as a certain rule in all her conversation and behaviour,
that when once mar∣riage has (in <HI>Lucy</HI>'s phrase) 
<Q REND="inline">"made an honest woman of her,"</Q> she is
intitled to all the licence of a courtezan.</P>
<P>I HAVE lately seen, with a good deal of compassion, a few
forward maiden ladies investing themselves with the dignities, and
incroaching on the privileges of this Order. It may not be improper to caution
them to recede in time. As their claim to these liberties is unwarranted by
custom, they will not retain that ambiguous reputation enjoyed by the
DEMI-REPS, whose whole system of conduct is founded on the basis of
matrimony. Every lady therefore, inclined to indulge herself in all those
little innocent freedoms, should confine herself within the pale of
matrimony, to elude censure, as insolvent debtors avoid a jail, by lodging
within the verge of the court.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="27"/>A DEMI-REP then must necessarily be
married: nor is it easy for a lady to maintain so critical a character
unless she is a woman of fashion. Titles and estate bear down all weak
censures, and silence scandal and detraction. That good-breeding too,
so inviolably preserved among persons of condition, is of infinite
service. This produces that de∣lightful insipidity so remarkable in
persons of quality, whose conversation flows with one even tenor,
undisturb'd by sen∣timent, and unruffled by passion: insomuch that
husbands and wives, brothers, sisters, cousins, and in short the
whole circle of kindred and acquaintance, can entertain the most thorough
contempt and even hatred for each other, without trans∣gressing the
minutest article of good-breeding and civility. But those females who want
the advantages of birth and fortune, must be content to wrap themselves up
in their in∣tegrity; for the lower sort are so notoriously deficient in
the requisites of politeness, that they would not fail to throw out the
most cruel and bitter invectives against the pretty delinquents.</P>
<P>THE Great World will, I doubt not, return me thanks for thus
keeping the <HI>canaille</HI> at a distance, and securing to them a quiet
possession of their enjoyments. And here I cannot but observe how
respectable an Order the DEMI-REPS compose, of which the lovely
sisterhood must all be married, and almost all Right Honourable.</P>
<P>FOR this Order, among many other embellishments of modern
life, we are indebted to the <HI>French:</HI> such flippant gaiety is more
agreeable to the genius of that nation. There is a native bashfulness
inherent in my countrywomen, which it is not easy to surmount: but our
modern fine ladies, who take as much pains to polish their minds, as to adorn
their persons, have got over this obstacle with incredible fa∣cility. 
<PB N="23" REF="28"/> They have so skillfully grafted the <HI>French</HI>
genius for intrigue upon <HI>British</HI> beauty and liberty, that their
conduct appears perfectly original. Though we must do the <HI>French</HI> the
justice to allow, that when a lady of this airy disposi∣tion visits
<HI>Paris,</HI> she returns most wonderfully improved. Upon the whole,
<HI>France</HI> appears the properest school to in∣struct the ladies in
the theory of their conduct, but <HI>England,</HI> and more especially
<HI>London,</HI> the most commodious place to put it in practice. In this
town, indeed, a lady studious of improvement may, in a very short time,
make a consider∣able proficiency by frequenting the several academies kept
constantly open for her profit and instruction. The Card-tables and
Masquerades in particular have trained up some ladies to a surprizing
eminence without the least assistance from a foreign education.</P>
<P>IT is observed, that the difference between the several
species in the scale of beings is but just sufficient to preserve
their distinction; the highest of one Order approaching so near to the
lowest of the other, that the gradation is hard to be determined; as the
colours of the rainbow, thro' an infinite variety of shades, die away into
each other imper∣ceptibly. The DEMI-REPS hold this intermediate station in
the characters of females between the modest women and the women of
pleasure; to both which they are in some measure connected, as they
stand upon the utmost verge of reputation, and totter on the brink of
infamy. It were therefore to be wished, that the Ladies wore some symbol
of their Order, or were distinguished by some peculiar mode of dress.
The <HI>Romans</HI> assigned different habits to persons of different
ages and stations; and I hope, that when the bustle of the ensuing
Election is over, the new Parliament will take this matter into
consideration, and oblige the se∣veral <PB N="24" REF="29"/> classes of
females to distinguish themselves by some external marks and badges of
their principles.</P>
<P>'TILL some Act of this nature shall take place, I shall
propose a method, by which every lady may exactly learn in what class she
may be reckoned. The world must know then, that my very good friend Mr.
AYSCOUGH has at length, with infinite pains and study, constructed a
Ther∣mometer, upon which he has delineated, after the manner that the degrees
of heat and cold are marked on the com∣mon sort, the whole scale of female
characters, from the most inviolable modesty to the most abandoned
impudence. It is of a commodious size to wear at a watch: the liquor within
the tube is a chymical mixture, which being acted on by the circulation of the
blood and animal spirits, will rise and fall according to the desires and
affections of the wearer. He will very shortly publish a large
assortment of them, to be sold at his shop on <HI>Ludgate-Hill:</HI>
and I flatter myself there are many women in <HI>England,</HI> who will be
glad to purchase such an effectual regulator of their passions. Every
lady therefore may avail herself of the instructions of tills
pocket-monitor; a monitor who will give her the most profitable lessons
without the usual impertinence of advice. It will be of equal efficacy if
worn by the men: but I ex∣pect my friend will have but little of their
custom; for as the reputation of chastity is the utmost aim of a fine
lady, to preserve even that in a fine gentleman is accounted mean and
unmanly.</P>

<DATE><HI>Feb.</HI> 26, 1754.</DATE></DATELINE> 
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> MUST beg leave to trouble you on a most serious and
melancholy subject; a subject which I fear will be attended with the most
dreadful consequences to the whole nation. Notwithstanding the last mail
brought the College positive assurances from the <HI>French</HI> King's
phy∣sicians, that the late PLAGUE at <HI>Rouen</HI> was entirely ceased, I
have the strongest reasons to apprehend that the contagion is already
spread to this city. My own practice daily fur∣nishes me with lamentable
instances, that manifestly indicate a pestilential disorder in the
blood and humours.</P>
<P>I WAS first induced to suspect that some Epidemical
Distemper was taking root among us, from my being called <PB N="26" REF="31"/>
in to a noble patient, who (as the public prints have in∣form'd you) has lately
been afflicted with a violent boil on his back. From this patient there have
issued continu∣ally great quantities of corruption of a yellow hue. His
complaint seems to be in some sort constitutional, as it com∣monly
breaks out with extraordinary virulence every seven year; and as this is the
crisis, we cannot pronounce our noble patient out of danger, 'till he has got
over the ensuing spring. It is moreover to be feared, that the contagion
has likewise reached <HI>Ireland</HI>; where we hear that the best
phy∣sicians are using the most forcing medicines, and are of opinion that
nothing can relieve the unhappy people, 'till they have <HI>voided a</HI>
STONE. A great man there labours also under the abovementioned complaint of
having a <HI>violent</HI> BOYLE <HI>on his back.</HI></P>
<P>I SHALL now proceed to give you the history of some other
cases, which have fallen under my notice, and are to me an indisputable
proof that the PLAGUE has got footing among us. It's malignancy shews
itself particularly about the Court; and we are assured that some parts
of the Country are also tainted with it. I have had the honour to attend
several Members of Parliament, whose cases are very des∣perate. Some I
found in a declining way, given over by all their friends; others are so
weak, that they can't stand alone; and many are so restless, that they
are continually turning from side to side. As I found they had great need
of support, I have advised them to drink plentifully of strong liquors,
and guard against the ill consequences of a <HI>Return.</HI></P>
<P>I VISITED the other day a young gentleman, who has lately been
promoted to a command in the squadron designed for the <HI>East
Indies.</HI> I found him in a most languishing con∣dition, his spirits
were quite depress'd, he had a violent palpitation of the heart, and the
whole nervous system was relax'd. I would have prescribed the well-known
diet-drink brought into practice by the late Bishop of <HI>Cloyne</HI>; but
he told me every thing went against his <PB N="27" REF="32"/> stomach that
favoured of <HI>Tar.</HI> However, I at length pre∣vailed on him to submit to
a long course of Sea Water. I have observ'd the same prognostics in
some of our land officers; to whom I have recommended the frequent use of
Exercise, together with a course of Steel, and a Powder composed of Nitre
and Brimstone.</P>
<P>A FRIEND of mine, one of the common-council men of this city,
is infected to a strong degree with the present pestilence. His chief
complaint is a <HI>canine</HI> appetite, and his wife assures me she has
often felt the wolf in his belly. The cause of this distemper is originally
in the palate, and discovers itself by a watering of the mouth from the
salival glands, and a grinding of the teeth as in the action of
mastication. This disorder being very common in the city, and likely to
spread among the Livery, I have directed him to <HI>perform Quarentine</HI>
by abstaining from flesh during the present Lent.</P>
<P>I KNOW another, a very worthy alderman, who now lies in a
most deplorable condition. He is swelled to a most enormous size; his
whole face, and particularly his nose, is crusted over with fiery
pustules of the confluent kind. He is afflicted with an insatiable
thirst, and is very subject to <HI>epileptic</HI> fits. I was sent for
last night, when one of these fits was very strong upon him. He lay, to
all appearance, dead on the floor, wallowing in the midst of a fetid mass,
partly solid, partly fluid, which had issued from his mouth and
nostrils with repeated eructations. I would immediately have administred to
him a proper dose of <HI>aq. font. tepefact.</HI> but on offering him the
draught he shew'd the strongest symptoms of a confirmed
<HI>Hydrophobia.</HI></P>
<P>I WENT out of charity to see a poor tragic author (no
reflection upon any of the profession, Mr. TOWN) who has been obliged to
keep his room all the winter, and is dying by inches of an inveterate
<HI>Atrophy.</HI> By his extravagant ra∣vings, sudden starts, incoherent
expressions, and passionate <PB N="28" REF="33"/> exclamations, I judged
his disorder to be seated in the brain, and therefore directed his head to
be blister'd all over. I cured another, a comic author, of a lethargy, by
making a revulsion of the bad humour from the part affected with
stimulating cathartics. A short squabby gentleman of a gross and
corpulent make was seiz'd with a kind of St. <HI>Vitus</HI>'s Dance, as he
was practising Harlequin for the masquerade: his whole body was convulsed
with the most violent writh∣ings, and irregular twitches; but I presently
removed his complaint by bleeding him in the foot.</P>
<P>THE PLAGUE, as I observed before, puts on different
appearances in different subjects. A person of quality, one of the club at
<HI>White</HI>'s, was seiz'd with the epidemical phrenzy raging there, which
propagates itself by certain black and red spots. He had suffered so
much loss by con∣tinual evacuations, that his whole substance was
wasted; and when I saw him he was so reduc'd, that there were no hopes of
a recovery. Another nobleman caught the infec∣tion at <HI>Newmarket,</HI> which
brought upon him such a <HI>running,</HI> that he is now in the last
stage of a <HI>galloping</HI> consumption. A reverend divine, lately made a
dignitary of the church, has unhappily lost his memory, and is so blind
withal, that he hardly knows any of his old acquaintance: the muscles of his
face are all contracted into an austere frown, his knees are stiff and
inflexible, and he is unable, poor gentleman! to bend his body, or move his
hand to his head. I have observ'd others seiz'd at times with a strange
kind of deaf∣ness; and at certain intervals I have found them so
prodigiously hard of hearing, that tho' a tradesman has bawled ever so
loudly in their ears, it has had no effect upon them.</P>
<P>BY what means this PLAGUE has been introduc'd among us, cannot
easily be ascertained;—whether it was imported in the same band-box
with the last new head, or was secretly convey'd in the plaits of an
embroider'd suit:—but that it came over hither from <HI>France,</HI>
plainly appears from the manner in which it affects our people of fashion,
(especially <PB N="29" REF="34"/> the ladies) who bear about them the most
evident marks of the <HI>French Disease.</HI> This is known to affect the
whole <HI>habit of body,</HI> and extends it's influence from head to foot. But
it's strongest attacks are levell'd at the face; and it has such an
effect upon the complexion, that it entirely changes the natural colour of the
skin. At <HI>Paris</HI> the face of every lady you meet is besmear'd with
unguent, ceruss, and plaister; and I have lately remarked with infinite
con∣cern the native charms of my pretty countrywomen de∣stroyed by the same
cause. In this case I have always pro∣posed calling in the
assistance of a surgeon to pare off this un∣natural <HI>Epidermis</HI>
or Scarf-skin, occasion'd by the ignorance of Empirics in the immoderate
application of <HI>Alteratives.</HI></P>
<P>FROM what I have been able to collect from observations on
my female patients, I have found little variation in the ef∣fects of the PLAGUE
on that sex. Most of them complain of a lassitude, a
listlessness, an uneasiness, pains they don't know where, vapours,
hysterics, want of rest, want of spi∣rits, and loss of appetite:
consequently the same regimen may serve for all. I advise them to use
a great deal of exercise in driving about the town, to dilute properly with
tea, to perspire freely at public places, and in their seasons to go to
<HI>Bath, Tunbridge, Cheltenham,</HI> or <HI>Scarborough.</HI></P>
<P>I WAS indeed surpriz'd with an extraordinary new case the
other night, when I was called out of bed to attend a Maid of Honour, who is
frequently afflicted with fits of the mother. Her abdomen I found, upon
examination, to be preternaturally distended: the tumour has been gradually
increasing; but I would not attempt to discuss it, as it was not yet
arrived at maturity. I intend soon to remove her into the country for a
month, in order to deliver her from the complaint she labours under.</P>
<P>I HAVE been induced, sir, to write to you on this
oc∣casion, as you are pleas'd to take this city under your im∣mediate care.
So alarming an evil calls upon us all to <PB N="30" REF="35"/> oppose it's
progress; for my own part, nothing shall deter me from a diligent
discharge of the duty of my profession, tho' it has already exposed me
to the greatest dangers in the execution of it. An old captain of a man of
war, who is grievously troubled with the <HI>cholera morbus,</HI> and
overflowing of the gall, on my only hinting a Clyster swore vehemently that
I should take one myself, and applying his foot di∣rectly to my fundament,
kick'd me down stairs. This very morning I escaped almost by miracle from
the contagion, which raged in the most violent degree through a whole family.
The master and mistress are both of them in a very high fever, and quite
frantic and delirious: their tongues were prodigiously inflamed, the tip very
sharp, and perpe∣tually vibrating without the least intermission. I
would have prescribed some cooling and lenitive medicines, but the
hus∣band in the height of his frenzy flung my wig into the fire, and his wife
sluiced me with extravasated urine. As I retired with precipitation, I
heard the same wild ravings from the nursery, the kitchen, and every other
quarter, which convin∣ced me that the pestilence had seiz'd the whole
house. I ran out of doors as fast as possible, reflecting with Terence,

<Q> 
<L>—Ipsa si cupiat Salus,</L> 
<L>Servaré prorsùs non potest hanc
familiam.</L></Q></P>
<P>UPON the whole, I may conclude with the Aphorism of
<HI>Hippocrates</HI>; that 
<Q REND="inline">"no people can possibly be afflicted with
so many and so terrible disorders, unless the PLAGUE is among
them."</Q></P>

fable call'd "The Education of the Muses." <HI>Apollo</HI> is there said to
have taken them at their birth under his immediate care, and as they grew up to
have instructed them according to their different capacities in the several
branches of playing and singing. <HI>Thalia,</HI> we are told, was of a
lively turn, and took delight in the most comic airs; but was at first with
difficulty restrained from falling into ridiculous drolleries, and what our
author calls <HI>extravaganzas</HI> in her manner. <HI>Melpomene,</HI> who was
of a serious and grave disposition, indulged herself in strains of
melancholy; but when she aimed at the most pathetic strokes, was often
harsh, or run into wild divisions. <HI>Clio,</HI> and the rest of the
Nine, had not yet learnt to temper their voices with sweet∣ness 
<PB N="32" REF="37"/> and variety; nor could they tell how to regulate the
stops of their flutes, or touch the strings of their lyres, with judgment
and grace. However, by much practice, they improved gradually under the
instructions of <HI>Apollo,</HI> 'till at last they were able to exert all
the powers of music: and they now form a compleat concert, which fills all
<HI>Parnassus</HI> with the most enchanting harmony.</P>
<P>THE moral to be drawn from this little fable is naturally
ap∣plied to those servants of the Muses, Authors, who must
ne∣cessarily rise by the same slow degrees from their first lame
attempts in cultivating the arts of <HI>Apollo.</HI> The best of them,
without doubt, went through many more stages of writing than appears from the
palpable gradations still remaining in their works. But as it is
impossible to trace them from their first setting out, I shall here
present the reader with the sum of my own experience, and illustrate in
the life of Mr. TOWN, the Progress of an Author.</P>
<P>RIGHT or wrong, I have ever been addicted to scribbling. I was
famous at school for my readiness at Crambo and capping verses: I often
made themes for other boys, and sold my copy for a tart or a custard: at
nine years old I was taken notice of for an <HI>English</HI> Distich, and
afterwards immor∣talized myself by an Holyday's Task in the same
language, which my master, who was himself a poet, pronounc'd to be
scarce inferior to his favourite <HI>Blackmore.</HI> These were fol∣lowed
by a multitude of little pieces, that, like other fruits which come before
their proper season, had nothing to re∣commend them but their early
appearance.</P>
<P>FILLED however with great conceptions of my genius and
importance, I could not but lament that such extraor∣dinary parts should be
confined within the narrow circle of <PB N="33" REF="38"/> my relations and
acquaintance. Therefore, in order to oblige and amaze the public, I soon
became a very large contributor to the Monthly Magazines. But I had the
un∣speakable mortification to see my favours sometimes not inserted,
often postponed, often much altered, and you may be sure for the worse.
On all these occasions I never failed to condemn the arrogance and folly of
the compilers of these miscellanies, wondering how they could so
grossly mi∣stake their own interest, and neglect the entertainment of
their readers.</P>
<P>IN the mean time a maiden aunt with whom I lived, a very pious
old lady, turned Methodist, and often took me with her to the Tabernacle, the
Foundery, and many private meetings. This made such an impression upon my
mind, that I devoted myself entirely to sacred subjects, and wrote
several Hymns, which were received with infinite applause by all the good
women who visited my aunt; and (the ser∣vants being also Methodists)
they were often sung by the whole family in the kitchen. I might perhaps in
time have rivalled <HI>Wesley</HI> in these divine compositions, and had
even be∣gun an entire new version of the Psalms, when my aunt, changing her
religion a second time, became a Moravian. But the Hymns usually sung by
the United Brethren contain sentiments so sublime and so
incomprehensible, that not∣withstanding my late success in that kind of
poetry, and the great opinion I entertained of my own talents, I durst not
venture on their stile and manner.</P>
<P>AS Love and Poetry mutually produce each other, it is no wonder
that before I was seventeen I had singled out my particular
<HI>Sacharissa.</HI> This, you may suppose, gave birth to innumerable
Songs, Elegies, and Acrostics. In the space of two years I had written more
love-verses than <PB N="34" REF="39"/> <HI>Waller</HI> or any other poet;
when, just as I imagined I had ryhmed myself into her good graces, I had
the mortification to find that my mistress was married to a Cornet of
Horse, a fellow who, I am sure, never wrote a line in his life. This threw
me into such a violent rage against the whole sex, that I immediately
burnt every syllable I had written in her praise, and in bitterness of
soul translated the sixth Satire of <HI>Juvenal.</HI></P>
<P>SOON after this the son and heir of Lord <HI>Townly,</HI> (to
whom I have the honour of being a distant relation) was in a treaty of
marriage with a rich heiress. I sat down im∣mediately with great
composure to write an Epithalamium on this occasion. I trimm'd
<HI>Hymen</HI>'s torch, and invited the <HI>Loves</HI> and <HI>Graces</HI> to
the wedding: <HI>Concord</HI> was prepared to join their hands, and
<HI>Juno</HI> to bless them with a numerous race of children. After all
these pains, when every thing was ready for the wedding, and the last hand
put to the Epithalamium, the match was suddenly broke off, and my poem of
course rendered useless. I was more uneasy under this disappointment
than any of the parties could possibly be; 'till I was informed of the
sudden marriage of a noble lord with a celebrated beauty. On this popular
occasion, promising myself universal applause, I immediately
published my Epi∣thalamium; which, like <HI>Bayes</HI>'s Prologue, was
artfully contrived to serve one purpose as well as another.</P>
<P>AS my notions had been hitherto confined within a narrow
sphere of life, my literary pursuits were consequently less important,
'till I had the opportunity of enlarging my ideas by going abroad. My travels,
of which I have before hinted something to the reader, opened to me a new and
extensive field for observation. I will not presume to boast, that I
received any part of my education at <HI>Geneva,</HI> or any of those 
<PB N="35" REF="40"/> celebrated foreign Universities, in which alone an
ENGLISH∣MAN can be grounded in the principles of religion and
liberty:—but I may say without vanity that I gleaned some useful
knowledge from every place I visited. My propensity to writing followed me
wherever I went; and were I to meet with encouragement by a large
subscription, I could publish several volumes of curious remarks which
I made in my tour. I had indeed like to have got into some unlucky scrapes,
by turning author in places where the liberty of the press was never so
much as heard of. At <HI>Paris</HI> I narrowly escaped being put into the
<HI>Bastile</HI> for a little <HI>Chanson à boire</HI> reflecting on
the Mistress of the <HI>Grand Monarque</HI>; and I was obliged to quit
<HI>Rome</HI> a week sooner than I intended, for fixing on <HI>Pasquin</HI>
a Prayer for the Pope's Toe, which was then laid up with the gout.</P>
<P>IT was not 'till my return from abroad, that I formally
commenc'd a professed Critic, for which I now thought myself thoroughly
qualified. I could draw parallels between <HI>Marseilles</HI> and
<HI>Denoyer,</HI> compare the behaviour of the <HI>French</HI> Parterre with
the <HI>English</HI> Pit, and have lately made a figure by affecting an
indifference about the present Burlettas, as I took care to let every body
know that I had often seen them in <HI>Flanders.</HI> My knowledge in
theatrical affairs naturally led me to write a great number of occasional
pamphlets on those topics, such as "Examens of New Plays, Letters to the
Managers," &amp;c. Not content with this, I had a strong inclination to
shine in the Drama. I often pleased myself with computing— 
<Q REND="inline">"three benefit nights—let me
see—six hundred pounds at least—an hundred more for the
copy—besides a perpetual freedom of the House."</Q>—These
were temptations not to be resisted. I sat down therefore to a Tragedy;
but before I got through the first act, de∣spairing to make it
sufficiently <HI>pathetic</HI> for the modern taste, <PB N="36" REF="41"/> I
chang'd my scheme, and began a Comedy: then again reflecting that most of
our Comedies were in reality nothing but overgrown Farces, contented myself
with writing what authors are now pleased to call a Comedy of two Acts. This
I finished with a great deal of pains, and very much to my own
satisfaction: but not being able to get it on the stage, as one house was
entirely taken up with Pantomimes, and the Manager of the other had so many
Farces of his own, I generously made a present of it to an actor for his
benefit;—when to my great surprize it was damn'd.</P>
<P>I HAVE at last resolv'd to bend all my attention, and
em∣ploy all my powers, in the carrying on this my present ela∣borate
undertaking. I am sorry to own that the success has not at all answer'd
my expectations: I flatter'd myself with being universally known, read, and
admir'd; but I find quite the contrary. I went into a coffee-house the other
day by White-chapel Mount, where on asking for the CONNOISSEUR the woman
stared at me, and said she did not know what I meant. I dined last week
at a foreign ambassador's, and not a word about me or my works passed
at table. I wrote to a relation at <HI>Caermarthen,</HI> desiring to know
what reputation my paper has in Wales; but he tells me that nothing in the
li∣terary way comes down there but the <HI>King's Speech</HI> and the
<HI>London Evening Post.</HI> I have enquired into the sale of my first
number, my second, my third, my fourth, and the last; yet I cannot
assure my readers that I have sold three thousand of any one of them.
In short, I give this public notice once for all, that if I don't find
myself taken in all over <HI>England</HI> by the time I have published two
or three hundred papers,—let them look to it—let them look to
it—I'll bid adieu to my ungrateful country, go directly to
<HI>Berlin,</HI> and (as <HI>Voltaire</HI> is discarded) employ my pen in the
service of that Encourager of Arts and Sciences, the King of
<HI>Prussia.</HI></P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE ingenious correspondent, to whom I am obliged for the
following letter, will, I hope, excuse the alterations, which I have taken
the liberty to make in it.</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>To Mr. TOWN.</HEAD>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I SHALL make no apology for recommending to your notice as
CENSOR GENERAL, a fault which is too common among married people. Love is
indeed a very rare ingredient in modern wedlock, nor can the 
<PB N="38" REF="43"/> parties entertain too much affection for each other; but
an open display of it on all occasions renders them ri∣diculous.</P>
<P>A FEW days ago I was introduced to a young couple, who were
but lately married, and are reckoned by all their acquaintance to be exceeding
happy in each other. I had scarce saluted the bride, when the husband
caught her eagerly in his arms, and almost devoured her with kisses. When
we were seated, they took care to place themselves close to each other,
and during our conver∣sation he was piddling with her fingers, tapping her
cheek, or playing with her hair. At dinner they were mutually employed in
pressing each other to taste of every dish, and the fond appellations
of 
<Q REND="inline">"my dear, my love, &amp;c."</Q> were
continually bandied across the table. Soon after the cloth was removed, the
lady made a motion to re∣tire, but the husband prevented the compliments of
the rest of the company by saying, 
<Q REND="inline">"We should be unhappy without her."</Q> As
the bottle went round he join'd her health to every toast, and could not help
now and then rising from his chair to press her hand, and mani∣fest the
warmth of his passion by the ardour of his ca∣resses. This precious
fooling, though it highly enter∣tained them, gave me great disgust,
therefore, as my com∣pany might very well be spared, I took my leave as
soon as possible.</P>
<P>THIS behaviour, though at all times improper, may in some
sort be excused, where perhaps the match has been huddled up by the
parents, and the young people are such new acquaintance, that they scarce
ever saw each other 'till their marriage. A pair of loving turtles may be
indulged in a little amorous billing at their first coming 
<PB N="39" REF="44"/> together, but this licence should expire with the
Honey-moon, and even in that period be used but sparingly.</P>
<P>NOTHING is more common than to see a new-married couple
setting out with a splendor in their equipage, fur∣niture, and manner of
living, which they have been after∣wards obliged to retrench: thus it happens
when they have made themselves remarkable by a show of excessive love.
They begin with great <HI>eclat,</HI> are lavish of their fondness at
first, but their whole stock is soon wasted, and their poverty is the
more insupportable, as their former profusion has made it more
conspicuous. I have remark∣ed the ill consequence of this indiscretion in
both cases: one couple has at last had separate beds, while the other
have been carried to the Opera in hackney chairs.</P>
<P>TWO people, who are to pass their whole lives toge∣ther, may
surely find time enough for dalliance without playing over their pretty
tricks in public. How ridicu∣lous would it appear, if in a large assembly
every one should select his mate, and the whole company should fall into
couples, like the birds on St. <HI>Valentine's Day!</HI> It is equally absurd
to see a man and his wife eternally tri∣fling and toying together, 
<Q> 
<L>Still amorous, and fond, and billing,</L> 
<L>Like <HI>Philip</HI> and <HI>Mary</HI> on a
shilling.</L> 
<BIBL>HUDIB.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>I HAVE often been reduced to a kind of aukward distress on
these occasions, not knowing which way to look, or what to say. I
consider them as playing a game in which the stander-by is not at all
interested, and would there∣fore <PB N="40" REF="45"/> recommend it to every
third person in these circum∣stances to take it as a hint that the
parties have a mind to be alone, and leave the room without further
ceremony.</P>
<P>A FRIEND of mine happened to be engaged in a visit to one of
these loving couples. He sat still for some time with∣out interrupting
the little endearments that passed between them. Finding them at length
quite lost in Nods, Whis∣pers, Ogles, and in short wholly taken up with
each other, he rang the bell, and desired the servant to send in my
lady's woman. When she came, he led her very gravely to the settee, and
began to indulge himself in certain free∣doms, which provoked the damsel to
complain loudly of his rudeness. The lady flew into a violent passion,
and rated him severely for his monstrous behaviour. My friend beg∣ged her
pardon with great politeness, hoped she was not offended, for that he
thought there had been no harm in amusing himself a little while with Mrs.
<HI>Betty,</HI> in the same manner as Her Ladyship and Sir <HI>John</HI>
had been amusing themselves these two hours.</P>
<P>BUT if this conduct is blameable in young people, how very
absurd is it in those advanced in years! Who can help laughing when he
sees a worn-out Beau and Belle practising at threescore the very follies
that are ridiculous at sixteen? I could wish that such a pair of
antiquated lovers were de∣lineated by the pencil of a Hogarth. How
humourously would he represent two emaciated wrinkled figures, with eyes
sunk into their heads, lank cheeks, and toothless gums, affecting to leer,
smile, and languish at each other! But this affectation is still more
remarkable, when a liquorish old fool is continually fondling a young wife:
though perhaps the sight is not so disgusting to a stranger, who may
reasonably <PB N="41" REF="46"/> suppose it to be the overflowings of a
father's tenderness for his daughter.</P>
<P>IT sometimes happens that one of them perceives the folly of
this behaviour. I have seen a sensible man quite uneasy at the
indiscreet marks of kindness shewn by his lady. I know a clergyman in the
country, who is often put to the blush by the strange familiarities, which
his wife's love induces her to take with him. As she has had but an
indifferent education, you would often be at a loss to know whether she is
very kind, or very rude. If he dines abroad, she always sees him get on
horseback, and before he has got twenty yards from the door, hollows after
him, 
<Q REND="inline">"be at home in time, my dear dog, do."</Q> I
have known her almost quarrel with him for not buttoning his coat in the
middle of Summer, and she once had the good nature to burn a very valuable
collection of <HI>Greek</HI> Manuscripts, lest the poring over those
horrid crooked letters should put her dear <HI>Jack</HI>'s eyes out. Thus
does she tor∣ment the poor parson with her violent affection for him, and
according to the common phrase, kills him with kindness.</P>
<P>I WOULD recommend it to all married people, but especi∣ally
to the ladies, not to be so sweet upon their dears before company. But I
would not be understood to countenance that coldness and indifference,
which is so fashionable in the polite world. Nothing is accounted more
ungenteel than for a husband and wife to be seen together in public places;
and if they should ever accidentally meet, they take no more notice of each
other, than if they were absolute strangers. The gentleman may lavish as
much gallantry as he pleases on other women, and the lady give encouragement
to twenty pretty fellows without censure; <PB N="42" REF="47"/> but they would
either of them blush at being surprized in shewing the least marks of a
regard for each other.</P>
<P>BEFORE I conclude I cannot but take notice of those
luscious love-scenes, that have so great a share in our mo∣dern plays;
which are rendered still more fulsom by the officiousness of the
player, who takes every opportunity of heightening the expression by
kisses and embraces. In a Comedy, nothing is more relished by the
audience than a loud smack which echoes through the whole house, and in the
most passionate scenes of a Tragedy, the Hero and Heroine are
continually flying into each others arms. For my part I am never present at a
scene of this kind, which produces a conscious simper from the Boxes, and
a hearty chuckle of applause from the Pit and Galleries, but I am ready to
exclaim with old <HI>Renault</HI>— 
<Q REND="inline">"I like not these huggers."</Q></P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<DIV2 TYPE="body of issue">
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> MUST acknowledge the receipt of many letters containing very
lavish encomiums on my works. Among the rest a correspon∣dent, whom I
take to be a Bookseller, is pleased to compliment me on the goodness of
my print and paper, but tells me that he is very sorry not to see
something expressive of my undertaking in the little cut that I carry in
front. It is true, indeed, that my printer and publisher held several
consultations on this subject; and I am ashamed to confess that they
had once prevailed on me to suffer a profile of my face to be prefixed to
each number. But when it was finished, I was quite mortified to see what a
scurvy figure I made in wood: nor could I submit to be hung out, like
<HI>Broughton,</HI> at my own <PB N="44" REF="49"/> door, or let my face
serve, like the canvass before a booth, to call people in to the
show.</P>
<P>I HOPE it will not be imputed to envy or malevolence, that I
here remark on this part of the productions of Mr. <HI>Fitz-Adam.</HI> When he
gave his paper the title of <HI>The</HI> WORLD, I suppose he meant to
intimate his de∣sign of describing that part of it, who are known to
ac∣count all other persons No Body, and are therefore empha∣tically call'd
<HI>The</HI> WORLD. if this was to be pictured out in the head-piece, a lady at
her toilette, a party at whist, or the jovial member of the
<HI>Dilettanti</HI> tapping the world for champagne, had been the most
natural and obvious hieroglyphics. But when we see the portrait of a
philoso∣pher poring on the globe, instead of observations on modern life
we might more naturally expect a system of geography, or an attempt towards
a discovery of the longitude.</P>
<P>THE reader will smile perhaps at a criticism of this kind;
yet certainly even here propriety should be observed, or at least all
absurdities avoided: but this matter being usually left to the printer or
bookseller, it is often attended with strange blunders and
mis-applications. I have seen a Sermon ushered in with the
representation of a shepherd and shep∣herdess sporting on a bank of
flowers, with two little Cupids smiling over head; while perhaps an
Epithalamium or an Ode for a Birth-day has been introduced with death's heads
and cross-marrow-bones.</P>
<P>THE inhabitants of <HI>Grubstreet</HI> are generally very
studious of propriety in this point. Before the half-penny account of an
horse-race, we see the jockeys whipping, spurring, jostling, and the
horses straining within sight of the post. The last dying speech,
character, and behaviour of the <PB N="45" REF="50"/> malefactors presents us
with a prospect of the place of execution; and the history of the London
Prentice exhibits the figure of a lad standing between two lions, and
ram∣ming his hands down their throats. A due regard has been paid to this
article in the several elegies from that quarter on the death of Mr.
<HI>Pelham.</HI> They are encom∣passed with dismal black lines, and all
the sable emblems of death; nor can we doubt but that an author, who takes
such care to express a decent sorrow on the outside of his work, has
infused a great deal of the pathetic into the piece itself.</P>
<P>THESE little embellishments were originally designed to
please the eye of the reader, as we tempt children to learn their letters by
disposing the alphabet into pictures. But in our modern compositions,
they are not only ornamental but useful. An angel or a flowerpot, at the
beginning and end of every chapter or section, enables the bookseller to
spin out a novel, without plot or incident, to a great number of volumes; and
by the help of these decorations properly disposed I have known a little
piece swell into a duodecimo, which had scarce matter enough for a
six-penny pamphlet.</P>
<P>IN this place I might also take notice of the several new
improvements in the business of Typography. Though it is reckoned ungenteel
to write a good hand, yet every one is proud of appearing in a beautiful print;
and the pro∣ductions of a man of quality come from the press in a very neat
letter, though perhaps the Manuscript is hardly legible. Indeed, our modern
writers seem to be more sollicitous a∣bout outward elegance than the
intrinsic merit of their compositions; and on this account it is thought no
mean recommendation of their works, to advertise that they are neatly printed
on an entire new letter. Nor are they only <PB N="46" REF="51"/> indebted to the
press for the beauty of the type, but often call in it's assistance to
explain and enforce the sentiment. When an author is in doubt whether the
reader will be able to comprehend his meaning, or indeed whether he has any
meaning at all, he takes care to sprinkle the sen∣tence with
<HI>Italicks:</HI> but when he would surprize us with any thing more
striking than ordinary, he distinguishes the emphatical words by large
staring CAPITALS, which overtop the rest of their fellows, and are
intended, like the grenadiers caps, to give us an idea of something grand and
uncommon. These are designed as so many hints to let the reader know
where he is to be particularly affected, and answer the same purpose with
the marginal direc∣tions in plays, which inform the actor when he is to laugh
or cry.</P>
<P>THIS practice is most remarkable in pieces of modern wit and
humour; and it may be observed that where there is the least of these
lively qualities, the author is most de∣sirous of substituting these
arts in their room; imagining that by a judicious distribution of these
enlivening strokes in different parts of it, his work, however dull in
itself, will become smart and brilliant. But it must not be
dissembled that the hint was originally taken from the Theatres. The writer
of the play-bills deals out his capitals in so just a proportion, that you
may tell the salary of each actor by the size of the letter in which his
name is printed. When the present manager of <HI>Drury-Lane</HI> first came
upon the stage, a new set of types two inches long were cast on purpose
to do justice to his extraordinary merit. This is so proper that the
severest critics on the Drama cannot be offended at this piece of
theatrical justice.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="52"/>THERE is lately sprung up among us a new
species of writers, who are most of them persons of the first rank and
fashion. At this period the whole House of Commons are turned authors; and
we cannot sufficiently admire the pro∣priety of stile and sentiment in
those elegant addresses, by which they humbly offer themselves as
candidates, and beg the favour of your votes and interest. These gentlemen
avail themselves greatly of the arts of printing abovemen∣tioned; whether
they would raise the merits of their own cause, or throw out invectives on
the opposite party. The Courtier sets before your eyes his steady
attachment to King GEORGE, while his opponent displays in the same manner
his zeal for LIBERTY and the CONSTI∣TUTION. This must undoubtedly have a
wonderful effect on the electors; and I could assure any patriot the most
certain success, who should manifest his regard for Old England by
printing his addresses in the Old English character.</P>
<P>BUT in the whole republic of letters there are none perhaps who
are more obliged to the printer than the writers of periodical essays. The
SPECTATORS indeed came into the world without any of the advantages we are
possess'd of. They were originally published in a very bad print and
paper, and were so entirely destitute of all outward ornaments, that (like
<HI>Terence</HI>'s virgin) 
<Q REND="inline">"unless the soul of beauty had breath'd
through the compositions themselves, these disadvantages would have
suppress'd the least appearances of it."</Q> 
<Q> 
<L>—nî vis boni</L> 
<L>In ipsâ inesset formâ, haec formam
extinguerent.</L></Q> </P>
<P>AS it requires no genius to supply a defect of this na∣ture,
our modern essays as much excell the SPECTATORS <PB N="48" REF="53"/> in
elegance of form, as perhaps they may be thought to fall short of them in
every other respect. But they have this additional advantage, that by the
fineness of their paper they are rescued from serving many mean and
ignoble pur∣poses to which they might otherwise be applied. They also
form themselves more commodiously into volumes, and become genteeler
appendages of the tea-table. The candid reader will undoubtedly impute this
extraordinary care about externals to the modesty of us present
essayists, who are willing to compensate for our poverty of genius by
bestowing these outward graces and embellishments on our works. For my
own part I never reflect on the first unadorned publication of the SPECTATOR,
and at the same time take up one of my own papers set off with every
ornament of the press, but I am afraid that the critics will apply what a
facetious peer is said to have remarked on a different occasion, that 
<Q REND="inline">"The first is a soul without a body, and the
last a body without a soul."</Q></P>
<P>AS in this fashionable age there are many of Lord
<HI>Pop∣pington</HI>'s opinion, that a book should be recommended by it's
outside to a man of quality and breeding, it is incum∣bent on all authors to
appear as well drest as possible, if they expect to be admitted into
polite company: yet we should not lay too much stress on the decorations
of our works, but rather remember <HI>Tully</HI>'s precept to all who build,
that 
<Q REND="inline">"the owner should be an ornament to the
house, and nor the house to the owner."</Q></P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE publication of Lord <HI>Bolinbroke</HI>'s post∣humous
works has given new life and spirit to Freethinking. We seem at present
to be endeavouring to unlearn our Catechism, with all that we have been
taught about Religion, in order to model our faith to the fashion of his
Lordship's system. We have now nothing to do but to throw away our
Bibles, turn the churches into theatres, and rejoice that an act of Parliament
now in force gives us an opportunity of getting rid of the Clergy by
transportation. I was in hopes that the extraordinary price of these
volumes would have confined their influence to persons of quality. As they
are placed above extreme indigence and absolute want of bread, 
<PB N="50" REF="55"/> their loose notions would have carried them no farther
than plundering their country: but if these opinions spread among the
vulgar, we shall be knocked down at noonday in our streets, and nothing
will go forward but robberies and murders.</P>
<P>THE instances I have lately seen of Freethinking in the
lower part of the world make me fear they are going to be as fashionable and
as wicked as their betters. I went the other night to the <HI>Robin Hood,</HI>
where it is usual for the advocates against religion to assemble, and
openly avow their infidelity. One of the questions for the night was, 
<Q REND="inline">"Whether Lord <HI>Bolinbroke</HI> had not done
greater service to mankind by his writings than the Apostles or
Evangelists?"</Q> As this society is chiefly composed of lawyers clerks,
petty tradesmen, and the lowest mechanics, I was at first sur∣prized to
find such amazing erudition among them. <HI>Toland, Tindal, Collins,
Chubb,</HI> and <HI>Mandeville,</HI> they seemed to have got by heart. A
shoemaker harangued his five minutes upon the excellence of the tenets
maintained by Lord <HI>Bolin∣broke</HI>; but I soon found that his reading
had not been ex∣tended beyond the <HI>Idea of a Patriot King,</HI> which he had
mistaken for a glorious system of Freethinking. I could not help
smiling at another of the company, who took pains to shew his disbelief
of the Gospel by unsainting the Apostles, and calling them by no other
title than plain <HI>Paul,</HI> or plain <HI>Peter.</HI> The proceedings of
this society have, in∣deed, almost induced me to wish, that like the
Roman Ca∣tholics, they were not permitted to read the Bible, rather than they
should read it, only to abuse it.</P>
<P>I HAVE frequently heard many wise tradesmen settling the
most important articles of our faith over a pint of beer. A baker took
occasion from <HI>Canning</HI>'s affair to maintain, in <PB N="51" REF="56"/>
opposition to the Scriptures, that man might live by bread alone, at least
that woman might; for else, said he, how could the girl have been
supported for a whole month by a few hard crusts? In answer to this, a
barber-surgeon set forth the improbability of that story, and thence
inferred, that it was impossible for our Saviour to have fasted forty
days in the wilderness. I lately heard a midshipman swear that the Bible
was all a lie: for he had sailed round the world with Lord <HI>Anson,</HI>
and if there had been any Red Sea, he must have met with it. I know a
bricklayer, who, while he was working by line and rule, and carefully laying
one brick upon another, would argue with a fellow-labourer, that the world was
made by chance; and a cook, who thought more of his trade than his bible, in a
dispute about the miracles, made a pleasant mistake about the nature of
the first, and gravely asked his antagonist what he thought of the SUPPER
at <HI>Cana.</HI></P>
<P>THIS affectation of Freethinking, among the lower class of
people, is at present happily confined to the men. On Sundays, while the
husbands are toping at the alehouse, the good women their wives think it
their duty to go to church, say their prayers, bring home the text, and read
the lessons with their families. But our polite ladies are, I fear, in
their lives and conversations little better than Freethinkers. Going to
church, since it is now no longer the fashion to carry on intrigues there,
is almost wholly laid aside; and I verily believe, that nothing but another
earthquake can ever fill the churches with people of quality. The fair sex in
general are too thoughtless to concern them∣selves in deep enquiries into
matters of religion. It is suf∣ficient that they are taught to believe
themselves angels: it would therefore be an ill compliment, while we talk of
the heaven they bestow, to persuade them into the <HI>Mahometan</HI> 
<PB N="52" REF="57"/> notion, that they have no souls: tho' perhaps our fine
gentle∣men may imagine, that by convincing a lady she has no soul, she
will be less scrupulous about the disposal of her body.</P>
<P>THE ridiculous notions maintained by Freethinkers in their
writings scarce deserve a serious refutation; and per∣haps the best
method of answering them would be to select from their works all the
absurd and impossible notions, which they so stiffly maintain in
order to evade the belief of the Christian Religion. I shall here throw

<OPENER>
<SALUTE>My Lords and Gentlemen,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>EVER since we have thought fit to take these
Kingdoms into our immediate Care, We have made it Our earn∣est Endeavour to
go Hand in Hand with Your Wisdoms in <PB N="53" REF="58"/> promoting the
Welfare and Prosperity of the People. The important Business of Taxes,
Marriages, Jews and Lot∣teries, We have left to Your weighty Consideration,
while Ourselves have been employed in the Regulation of Fashions, the
Establishment of Taste, and Amendment of the Morals. We have the
Satisfaction to find that both Our Measures have hitherto met with Success:
And the Public Affairs are at present in so prosperous a Condition, that
the National Vices seem as likely to decrease as the National Debt.</P>
<P>THE Dissolution of Your Assembly is now at hand;
and as Your whole Attention will naturally be engaged in se∣curing to
Yourselves and Friends a Seat in the next Parlia∣ment, it is needless to
recommend to You, that Heads should be broken, Drunkenness encouraged, and
Abuse propagated; which has been found by Experience to be the best Method
of supporting the Freedom of Elections. In the mean Time, as the Care of the
Nation must be left to Us, it is necessary that during this Interval Our
Preroga∣tive, as CENSOR GENERAL, should be considerably ex∣tended, and that
We should be inverted with the united Power of Lords and Commons.</P>
<P>WHEN We are entrusted with this important Charge, We
shall expect that every different Faction fhall concur in Our Measures for
the Public Utility; that Whig and Tory, High Church and Low Church, Court and
Country, shall all unite in this Common Cause; and that opposite Parties
in the Body Politic, like the Arms and Legs in the Body Natural, shall move
in Concert, though they are on different Sides. In Our Papers, which We shall
continue to publish every <HI>Thursday</HI> under the Title of <HI>The</HI>
CONNOISSEUR, every Misdemeanor shall be examined, and Offenders called to
the Bar of the House. Be it therefore enacted, that these 
<PB N="54" REF="59"/> Our Orders and Resolutions have an equal Authority with
Acts of Parliament, as We doubt not They will be of equal Advantage to the
Community.</P>
<P>THE extraordinary Supplies requisite for the Service
of the current Weeks, and for the Support of Our Own Privy Purse, oblige Us
to demand of You, that a Sum, not exceeding Two-pence, be levied Weekly on each
Person, to be collected by Our trusty and well-beloved the Booksellers.
We must also particularly request of You, that the same Privilege and
Pro∣tection be extended to Us which is enjoyed by Yourselves, and is so
very convenient to many of your honourable Members. It is no less expedient
that We should be secured from Let or Molestation: Be it therefore
provided, that no one presume to arrest or cause to be arrested Our
Person, or the Persons of Our Publisher, Printer, Corrector, Devil, or
any other em∣ployed in Our Service.</P>
<P>WE have only to add, that You may rely on Our Care and
Diligence in discharging the high Trust reposed in Us, in such Manner
as shall merit the Thanks of the next Parliament. We shall then recommend
it to Their Consideration, whether it would not be for the Interest of
these Kingdoms, that We should have a Woolpack allotted Us with the
Bishops, or be allowed a Seat among the Commons, as the Representative of
the whole People: But if this should be deemed too great an Honour, it will
at least be thought necessary that We should be occasionally called
in, like the Judges, to give Our Opinion on Cases of Importance.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="body of issue">
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> AM obliged for to-day's paper to the same hand that
favoured me with the seventh number.</P>
<P>LEARNING, as it polishes the mind enlarges our ideas, and
gives an ingenuous turn to all our conver∣sation and behaviour, has ever been
esteemed a liberal ac∣complishment; and is indeed the principal
characteristic that distinguishes the gentleman from the mechanic.</P>
<P>THIS axiom being universally allowed and approved of, I have
often observed with wonder the neglect of learning that prevails among the
gentlemen of the army; who, not∣withstanding <PB N="56" REF="61"/> their
shameful deficiency in this main requisite, are generally proposed as the
most exact models of good behaviour, and standards of politeness.</P>
<P>THE art of war is no easy study: it requires much labour and
application to go through what <HI>Milton</HI> calls 
<Q REND="inline">"the rudi∣ments of soldiership in all the
skill of embattling, march∣ing, encamping, fortifying, besieging and
battering, with all the helps of ancient and modern stratagems, Tactics, and
warlike maxims."</Q> With all these every officer should undoubtedly be
acquainted; for mere regimentals no more create a soldier, than the cowl a
monk. But, I fear, the generality of our army have made little proficiency in
the art they profess, have learnt little more than just to acquit
themselves with some decency at a review, have not studied and examined
as they ought the ancient and modern principles of war, 
<Q> 
<L>"Nor the division of a battle know,</L> 
<L>"More than a spinster."</L> 
<BIBL>SHAKESPEARE.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>BESIDES the study of the art of war itself, there are many
collateral branches of literature, of which, as gen∣tlemen and as soldiers,
they should not be ignorant. Who∣ever bears a commission in the army
should be well read in history. The examples of <HI>Alexander,
Caesar,</HI> or <HI>Marl∣borough,</HI> however illustrious, are of little
concern to the generality of readers, but are set up as so many beacons, to
direct those who are pursuing the same course to glory. A thorough
knowledge of history would furnish a commander with true courage, inspire
him with an honest emulation of his ancestors, and teach him to gain a
victory without shedding blood.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="62"/>POETRY too, more especially that of the
ancients, seems particularly calculated for the perusal of those
concerned in war. The subject of the <HI>Iliad</HI> is intirely martial, and
the principal characters are distinguished from each other chiefly by their
different exertion of the single quality of courage. It was, I suppose,
on account of this martial spirit that breathes throughout the
<HI>Iliad,</HI> that <HI>Alexander</HI> was so captivated with it that he is
said to have laid it every night under his pillow. The principal character in
the <HI>Aeneid</HI> is a general of remarkable piety and courage, and great
part of the poem is made up of war. These studies cannot surely fail of
animating a modern breast, which often kindled such a noble ardour in the
antients.</P>
<P>IF we look into the lives of the greatest generals of
anti∣quity, we shall find them no mean proficients in science. They led
their armies to victory by their courage, and sup∣ported the state by their
counsels. They revered the same <HI>Pallas</HI> as the goddess of war and
of wisdom; and the <HI>Spartans</HI> in particular, before they entered on an
engagement, always sacrificed to the <HI>Muses.</HI> The exhortations given
by commanders before the onset are some of the most animated pieces of
oratory in all antiquity, and frequently produced astonishing effects,
rousing the soldiers from despair, and hurrying them on to victory. An
illiterate commander would have been the contempt of <HI>Greece</HI> and
<HI>Rome. Tully</HI> indeed was called <HI>the learned Consul</HI> in
derision, but then, as <HI>Dryden</HI> observes, 
<Q REND="inline">"His head was turned another way; when he read
the <HI>Tactics,</HI> he was thinking on the bar, which was his field of
battle."</Q> I am particularly pleased with the cha∣racter of <HI>Scipio
Aemilianus</HI> as drawn by <HI>Velleius Paterculus,</HI> and would recommend
it to the serious imitation of our mo∣dern officers. He was so great an
admirer of liberal studies, that he always retained the most eminent wits
in his camp: <PB N="58" REF="63"/> nor did any one fill up the intervals of
business with more elegance, retiring from war only to cultivate the arts
of peace; always employed in arms or study, always exercising his body with
perils, or disciplining his mind with science. The author contrasts this
amiable portrait with a description of <HI>Mummius,</HI> a general so
little versed in the polite arts, that hav∣ing taken at <HI>Corinth</HI>
several pictures and statues of the greatest artists, he threatened the
persons who were intrusted with the carriage of them to <HI>Italy,</HI> 
<Q REND="inline">"that if they lost those they should give
new ones."</Q></P>
<P>I WOULD fain have a <HI>British</HI> officer looked upon with
as much respect as those of <HI>Greece</HI> and <HI>Rome:</HI> but while
they neglect the acquisition of the same accomplishments, this can never
be the case. Instead of cultivating their minds, they are wholly taken up
in adorning their bodies, and look upon gallantry and intrigue as essential
parts of their character. To glitter in the boxes or at an assembly, is the
full display of their politeness, and to be the life and soul of a lewd
brawl almost the only exertion of their courage; insomuch that there is a
good deal of justice in <HI>Macheath's</HI> raillery, when he says, 
<Q REND="inline">"if it was not for us, and the other gentlemen
of the sword, <HI>Drury-Lane</HI> would be uninhabited."</Q></P>
<P>IT is something strange that Officers should want any
in∣ducement to acquire so gentleman-like an accomplishment as learning. If
they imagine it would derogate from their good-breeding, or call off their
attention from military busi∣ness, they are mistaken. Pedantry is no more
connected with learning, than rashness with courage. <HI>Caesar,</HI> who
was the finest gentleman and the greatest general, was also the best
scholar of his age.</P>
<P>TO say the truth, learning wears a more amiable aspect and
winning air in courts and camps, whenever it appears <PB N="59" REF="64"/>
there, than amid the gloom of colleges and cloisters. Mixing in genteel life
files off the rust that may have been contracted by study, and wears out
any little oddness or peculiarity that may be acquired in the closet. For
this reason the officer is more inexcusable who neglects an
accomplishment that would sit so gracefully upon him: for this reason
too, we pay so great deference to those few, who have enriched their minds
with the treasures of antiquity. An illiterate officer either hardens into a
bravo, or refines into a fop: the insipi∣dity of the fop is utterly
contemptible, and a rough brutal courage, unpolished by science, and
unassisted by reason, has no more claim to heroism than the
case-harden'd valour of a bruiser or prize-fighter. Agreably to this notion
<HI>Homer</HI> in the fifth <HI>Iliad</HI> represents the goddess
<HI>Minerva</HI> as wounding <HI>Mars,</HI> and driving the heavy deity off the
field of battle; implying allegorically, that wisdom is capable of subduing
courage.</P>
<P>I WOULD flatter myself that <HI>British</HI> minds are
still as no∣ble, and <HI>British</HI> genius as exuberant, as that of any
other nation or age whatever; but that some are debased by luxury, and
others run wild for want of proper cultivation. If <HI>Athens</HI> can boast
her <HI>Miltiades, Themistocles,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Rome</HI> her <HI>Camillus,
Fabius, Caesar,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>England</HI> has had her <HI>Edwards,
Henrys,</HI> and <HI>Marlboroughs.</HI> It is to be hoped the time will come,
when learning will be reckoned as necessary to qualify a man for the army,
as for the bar or pulpit. Then we may expect to see the <HI>British</HI>
soldiery enter on the field of battle, as on a theatre, for which they are
prepared in the parts they are to act. 
<Q REND="inline">"They will not then (as <HI>Milton</HI>
expresses himself with his usual strength in his <HI>Treatise on
Education)</HI> if intrusted with fair and hopeful armies, suffer them, for
want of just and wise discipline, to shed away from about 
<PB N="60" REF="65"/> them like sick feathers, tho' they be never so oft
supplied: They would not suffer their empty and unrecruitible co∣lonels of
twenty men in a company, to quaff out, or con∣vey into secret hoards, the
wages of a delusive list and a miserable remnant; yet in the mean while
to be over∣master'd with a score or two of drunkards, the only soldiery
left about them, or else to comply with all ra∣pines and violences. No
certainly, <HI>if they knew ought of that knowledge that belongs to good men
and good governors,</HI> they would not suffer these thing."</Q></P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE principal character in <HI>Steel</HI>'s comedy of the
<HI>Lying Lover</HI> is young <HI>Bookwit</HI>; an Oxonian, who at once throws
off the habit and manners of an academic, and assumes the dress, air, and
conversation of a man of the town. He is, like other fine Gentlemen, a
coxcomb, but a coxcomb of learning and parts. His erudition he renders
subservient to his pleasures: his knowledge in Poe∣try qualifies him for
a sonneteer, his Rhetoric to say fine things to the ladies, and his
Philosophy to regulate his equi∣page; for he talks of having
<HI>peripatetic</HI> footmen, a <HI>follower of Aristippus</HI> for a
<HI>Valet de Chambre,</HI> an <HI>epicurean</HI> cook, with an <HI>hermetical
chymist</HI> (who are good only at making fires) <PB N="62" REF="67"/> for a
scullion. Thus he is in every particular a fop of let∣ters, a compleat
classical beau.</P>
<P>BY a review I have lately made of the people in this great
metropolis, as CENSOR, I find that the town swarms with <HI>Bookwits.</HI>
The play-houses, park, taverns and coffee-houses are thronged with them.
Their manner, which has something in it very characteristic, and different
from the town-bred coxcombs, discovers them to the slightest observers.
It is indeed no easy matter for one whose chief employment is to store
his mind with new ideas, to throw that happy vacancy, that total absence of
thought and re∣flection into his countenance, so remarkable in our modern
fine gentlemen. The same lownging air too that passes for genteel in an
university coffee-house is soon distinguish'd from the genuine
careless loll, and easy saunter, and brings us over to the notion of Sir
<HI>Willfull</HI> in <HI>The Way of the World,</HI> that a man should be
bound 'prentice to a maker of fops, before he ventures to set up for
himself.</P>
<P>YET, in spite of all these disadvantages, the love of
pleasure and a few supernumerary guineas draws the student from his
literary employment, and entices him to this theatre of noise and hurry, this
grand mart of pleasure, where, as long as his purse can supply him, he
may be as idle as he pleases. I could not help smiling at a dialogue
between two of these gentlemen which I overheard a few nights ago at the
Bedford coffee-house. 
<Q REND="inline">"Ha! Jack! (says one accosting the other) is
it you? How long have you been in town?"—</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">"Two hours"—</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">"How long do you stay?"—</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">"Ten guineas.—If you'll come to
<HI>Venable</HI>'s after the play is over, you'll find <HI>Tom Latine, Bob
Classic</HI> and two or three more who will be very glad to see you. What
you're in town upon the sober plan at your father's? But hark ye
<HI>Frank,</HI> if you'll call in I'll <PB N="63" REF="68"/> tell your friend
<HI>Harris</HI> to prepare for you. So your servant; for I'm going to meet
the finest girl upon the town in the green boxes.</Q></P>
<P>I LEFT the coffee-house pretty late, and as I came into the
piazza the fire in the <HI>Bedford's Arms</HI> kitchen blazed so chearfully
and invitingly before me, that I was easily per∣suaded by a friend that was
with me, to pass the evening at that house. Our good fortune led us into
the next room to this knot of academical rakes. Their merriment being pretty
boisterous gave us a good pretext to enquire what company were in the next
room. The waiter told us, with a smartness which those fellows frequently
contract from at∣tending on beaux and wits, 
<Q REND="inline">"Some gentlemen from <HI>Ox∣ford</HI> with
some ladies, sir. My master is always very glad to see them, for while
they stay in town, they never dine or sup out of his house, and eat and
drink, and pay better than any nobleman in town.</Q></P>
<P>AS it grew later, they grew louder: 'till at length an unhappy
dispute arose between two of the company con∣cerning the present grand
contest between the Old and New Interest, which has lately inflamed
<HI>Oxfordshire.</HI> This accident might have been attended with ugly
consequences: but as the ladies are great enemies to quarrelling, unless
themselves are the occasion, a good-natured female of the company
interposed, and quelled their animosity. By the mediation of this fair one,
the dispute ended very fashion∣ably, in a bet of a dozen of claret to be
drank there by the company then present, whenever the wager should be
de∣cided. There was something so extraordinary in their whole evening's
conversation, such an odd mixture of the town and university, that I am
persuaded, if Sir <HI>Richard</HI> had been witness to it, he could have
wrought it into a scene as lively and entertaining as any he has left us.</P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="69"/>THE whole time these lettered beaux remain
in <HI>London</HI> is spent in a continual round of diversion. Their
sphere in∣deed is somewhat confined, for they generally eat, drink, and
sleep within the precincts of <HI>Covent-Garden</HI>; where after having
passed a day or two in the highest scenes of luxury and debauch, they
return (as <HI>Bookwit</HI> has it) to small beer and three-half-penny
commons.</P>
<P>I SHALL enlarge no further on this subject at present, but
conclude these reflexions with an ode which I have received from an unknown
correspondent, who tells me it was lately sent to one of these gentlemen,
(who had re∣signed himself wholly to these polite enjoyments, and
seemed to have forgot all his connexions with the university) from an
academical friend. All who peruse this elegant little piece will, I doubt
not, thank me for inserting it, and the learned reader will have the
additional pleasure of admiring it as a pleasant and humourous imitation of

<HEAD>To Mr. TOWN.</HEAD>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>BESIDES the common objections made to the late Marriage-Bill,
my own family furnishes me with a peculiar instance of the inconveniences
arising from it, which (though I dare say many others have experienc'd) has
not yet been taken notice of. You must know, Sir, that I have two daughters,
and it has ever been my greatest con∣cern <PB N="66" REF="71"/> to see them
well settled. They have had several very advantageous offers, which I
should have been very well pleased with, and would have come down very
handsomely; but they always put me off with saying, that indeed they could
not think of leaving their dear papa, that they should never be so happy
with husbands, as with each other,—and twenty excuses of the like
nature. But the case is now quite altered: and since the clamour about the
above∣mentioned Act they are frighted out of their wits, lest they should
get no husbands at all. My eldest girl has just taken it into her head to
be in love; and she is very uneasy that I am against her having an idle
young fellow, who is not worth a penny, and whom till lately she used to
look upon with contempt. As to poor <HI>Betsy,</HI> my youngest girl, she
has taken to the trick of eating chalk, oatmeal, and the like kind of trash,
which young girls are apt to grow fond of, when their thoughts are turned upon
an husband. I don't chuse to speak to them myself on this head; but as
the girls read your paper, I take this method of informing them that the
Marriage-Bill does not at all affect them, as they may depend on my not making
an ill use of my authority.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>URNING over the last volume of Lord <HI>Bolinbroke</HI>'s
works a few days ago, I could not help smiling at his extraordinary man∣ner
of commenting on some parts of the Scriptures. Among the rest he
represents <HI>Moses</HI> as making beasts accountable to the community
for crimes as well as men: whence his lordship infers, that the Jewish
Legislator supposed them capable of distin∣guishing between right and
wrong, and acting as moral agents. The oddity of this remark led me to reflect,
that if such an opinion should prevail in any country, what whimsical
laws would be enacted, and how ridi∣culous they would appear when put in
execution: as if <PB N="68" REF="73"/> the horse that carried the highwayman
should be ar∣raigned for taking a purse, or a dog indicted for
feloni∣ously stealing a shoulder of mutton. Such a country would seem
to go upon the same principles, and to entertain the same notions of
justice, as the puritannical old woman that hanged her cat for killing mice
on the sabbath-day.</P>
<P>THESE reflections were continued afterwards in my sleep; when
methought that such proceedings were com∣mon in our own courts of judicature.
I imagined my∣self in a spacious hall like the <HI>Old Bailey,</HI> where
they were preparing to try several animals, who had been guilty of offences
against the laws of the land. The walls I observed were hung all round with
bulls-hides, sheep∣skins, foxes tails, and the spoils of other brute
malefac∣tors; and over the justice-seat, where the <HI>King's-Arms</HI> are
commonly placed, there was fixed a large stag's head, which overshadowed
the magistrate with it's branching horns. I took particular notice that the
galleries were very much crouded with ladies; which I could not tell how to
account for, 'till I found it was expected that a Goat would be that day tried
for a rape.</P>
<P>THE sessions soon opened; and the first prisoner
that was brought to the bar was a Hog, who was prosecuted at the suit of
the Jews on an indictment for burglary, in break∣ing into their synagogue. As
it was apprehended that re∣ligion might be affected by this cause, and as the
prosecu∣tion appeared to be malicious, though the fact was plainly proved
against him, the Hog, to the great joy of all true christians was allowed
<HI>benefit of clergy.</HI></P>
<P>AN indictment was next brought against a Cat for killing a
favourite Canary-bird. This offender belonged to an old <PB N="69" REF="74"/>
woman, who was believed by the neighbourhood to be a witch. The jury therefore
were unanimous in their opi∣nion, that she was the devil in that shape, and
brought her in guilty. Upon which the judge formally pronounced sentence upon
her, which I remember concluded with these words: 
<Q REND="inline">"you must be carried to the place of
exe∣cution, where you are to be hanged by the neck nine times, 'till you are
dead, dead, dead, dead, dead, dead, dead, dead, dead; and the fidlers have
mercy upon your guts."</Q></P>
<P>A PARROT was next tried for <HI>Scandalum Magnatum.</HI> He was
accused by the Chief magistrate of the city, and the whole court of
Aldermen, for defaming them as they passed along the street on a public
festival, by singing 
<Q REND="inline">"Room for cuckolds, here comes a great company;
room for cuck∣olds here comes my Lord Mayor."</Q> This PARROT was a very old
offender, much addicted to scurrility, and had been several times convicted
of prophane cursing and swearing. He had even the impudence to abuse the
whole court by calling the Jury rogues and rascals, and frequently
interrupted my Lord Judge in summing up the evidence by crying out, Old
Bitch. The court however were pleased to shew mercy to him upon the
petition of his mistress, a strict methodist, who gave bail for his
good behaviour, and delivered him to Mr. <HI>Whitefield,</HI> who undertook to
make a thorough convert of him.</P>
<P>AFTER this a Fox was indicted for robbing an hen-roost. Many
farmers appeared against him, who deposed that he was a very notorious
thief, and had long been the terror of ducks, geese, turkies and all other
poultry. He had infested the country long time and had often been pursued,
but they could never take him before. As the Evidence was very 
<PB N="70" REF="75"/> full against him, the jury readily brought him in
guilty; and the judge was proceeding to condemn him, when the sly villain
watering his brush flirted it in the Face of the jai∣lor, and made off. Upon
this a country 'squire who was present, hollowed out <HI>stole away,</HI>
and a hue and cry was im∣mediately sent after him.</P>
<P>WHEN the uproar which this occasioned was over, a MILCH-ASS
was brought to the bar, and tried for contume∣liously braying, as she
stood at the door of a sick lady of quality. It appeared that this lady was
terribly afflicted with the vapours, and could not bear the least noise;
had the knocker always tyed up, and straw laid in the street.
Not∣withstanding which this audacious creature used every morning to give
her foul language, which broke her rest, and flung her into hysterics. For
this repeated abuse the criminal was sentenced to the pillory, and ordered
to lose her ears.</P>
<P>AN information was next laid against a Shepherd's DOG upon the
GAME-ACT for poaching. He was accused of killing an hare without being
properly qualified. But the plaintiff thought it adviseable to quash the
indictment, as the owner of the dog had a vote to sell at the next
election.</P>
<P>THERE now came on a very important cause, in which six of
the most eminent council learned in the law were retained on each side. A
MONKEY, belonging to a lady of the first rank and fashion, was indicted,
for that he with malice prepense did commit wilful murder on the body of a
lap-dog. The council for the prosecutor set forth, that the unfortunate
deceased came on a visit with another lady; when the Prisoner at the bar,
without the least provocation, and contrary to the laws of hospitality,
perpetrated this in∣human <PB N="71" REF="76"/> fact. The council for the
prisoner being called upon to make the MONKEY's defence, pleaded his
privilege, and insisted on his being tried by his peers. This plea was
ad∣mitted without demurr, and a jury of beaux was immediately impannelled, who
without going out of court honourably acquitted him.</P>
<P>THE proceedings were here interrupted by a HOUND, who came
jumping into the Hall, and running to the Jus∣tice-Seat lifted up his leg
against the Judge's robe. For this contemptuous behaviour he was directly
ordered into custody, when to our great surprize he cast his skin, and
became an OSTRICH; and presently after shed his feathers, and terri∣fied us
in the figure of a BEAR. Then he was a LION, then an HORSE, then again a
BABOON; and after many o∣other amazing transformations leaped out an HARLEQUIN,
and before they could take hold of him skipped away to
<HI>Co∣vent-Garden</HI> theatre.</P>
<P>IT would be tedious to recount the particulars of several
other trials. A sportsman brought an action against a RACE-HORSE for
running on the wrong side of the post, by which he lost the
<HI>Plate</HI> and many considerable betts. For this the criminal was
sentenced to be burnt in the forehand, and to be whipt at the Cart's tail. A
Mare would have undergone the same punishment for throwing her rider in a
Stag-hunt, but escaped by pleading her belly; upon which a jury of grooms was
impannelled, who brought her in quick. The company of DOGS and MONKEYS together
with the DAN∣CING BEARS, who were taken up on the LICENSE-ACT, and indicted for
Strollers, were transported for life.</P>
<P>THE last trial was for high treason. A LION, who had been
long confined as a State-prisoner in the TOWER, having <PB N="72" REF="77"/>
broke goal, had appeared in open rebellion, and commit∣ted several acts of
violence on his MAJESTY's liege-subjects. As this was a noble animal, and a
prince of the blood in his own native country, he was condemned to be beheaded.
It came into my thoughts, that this LION's HEAD might vie with that famous one
formerly erected at <HI>Button</HI>'s for the service of the GUARDIAN: I was
accordingly going to peti∣tion for leave to set it up in <HI>Macklin</HI>'s
new Coffee-house; when methought the Lion, setting up a most horrible
roar, broke his chains and put the whole court to flight; and I awaked in the
utmost consternation, just as I imagined he had got me in his gripe.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> SHALL this day present my readers with a letter which I
have received from my cousin VILLAGE; who, as I informed them in my first
paper, has undertaken to send me an account of every thing remarkable that
passes in the country.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>DEAR COUSIN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE not been unmindful of the province which you was
pleased to allot me; but the whole country has been lately so much taken up
with the business of Elec∣tions, that nothing has fallen under my notice,
but debates, squabbles, and drunken rencounters. The spirit of party 
<PB N="74" REF="79"/> prevails so universally, that the very children are
instructed to lisp out the names of the favourite chiefs of each fac∣tion;
and I have more than once been in danger of being knocked off my horse, as I
rode peaceably on, because I did not declare with which party I sided,
though I knew nothing at all of either. Every petty village abounds with the
most profound statesmen: it is common to see our rustic politicians
assembling after sermon, and settling the good of their country
across a tomb-stone, like so many <HI>Dictators from the plough</HI>; and
every cottage can boast its patriot, who, like the old <HI>Roman,</HI> would
not exchange his turnip for a bribe.</P>
<P>I AM at present in —, where the election is just
coming on, and the whole town consequently in an uproar. They have for
several parliaments returned two members, who recommended themselves by
constantly opposing the court: but there came down a few days ago a banker
from <HI>London,</HI> who has offered himself a candidate, and is backed with
the most powerful of all interests, money. Nothing has been since thought
of but feasting and revell∣ing; and both parties strive to outdo each other
in the frequency and expence of their entertainments. This indeed is the
general method made use of to gain the favour of electors, and manifest a
zeal for the constitution. I have known a candidate depend more upon the
strength of his liquor than his arguments; and the merits of a treat has
often recommended a member, who has had no merits of his own; for it is
certain, that people, however they may differ in other points, are unanimous in
promoting the grand business of eating and drinking.</P>
<P>IT is impossible to give a particular account of the
various disorders occasioned by the contest in this town. The 
<PB N="75" REF="80"/> streets ring with the different cry of each party, and
every hour produces a ballad, a set of queries, or a serious ad∣dress to
the worthy electors. I have seen the Mayor with half the Corporation roaring,
hollowing, and reeling along the streets, and yet threatening to clap a poor
fellow in the stocks for making the same noise, only because he would
not vote as they do. It is no wonder that the strongest connexions should
be broken, and the most inti∣mate friends set at variance, through their
difference of opinion. Not only the men, but their wives also are engaged in
the same quarrel. Mr. <HI>Staunch</HI> the haberdasher used to smoke
his pipe constantly in the same kitchen-corner every evening at the same
alehouse with his neighbour Mr. <HI>Veer</HI> the chandler, while their
ladies chatted together at the street-door: but now the husbands never
speak to each other; and consequently Mrs. <HI>Veer</HI> goes a quarter of
a mile for her inkle and tape, rather than deal at Mr. <HI>Staunch</HI>'s
shop; and Mrs. <HI>Staunch</HI> declares, she would go without her tea,
though she has always been used to it twice a day, rather than fetch her
half quartern from that turn-coat <HI>Veer</HI>'s.</P>
<P>WHEREVER Politics are introduc'd, Religion is always drawn
into the quarrel. The town I have been speaking of is divided into two
parties, who are distinguish'd by the appellation of <HI>Christians</HI>
and <HI>Jews.</HI> The <HI>Jews,</HI> it seems, are those, who are in the
interest of a nobleman who gave his vote for passing the
<HI>Jew</HI>-bill, and are held in abomi∣nation by the <HI>Christians.</HI>
The zeal of the latter is still further inflamed by the vicar, who every
sunday thunders out his anathemas, and preaches up the pious doctrine of
persecution. In this he is seconded by the clerk, who is careful to enforce
the arguments from the pulpit by se∣lecting staves proper for the
occasion.</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="81"/>THIS truly <HI>Christian</HI> spirit
is no where more manifest than at their public feasts. I was at one of
their dinners, where I found great variety of pig-meat was provided. The table
was covered from one end to the other with hams, legs of pork, spare-ribs,
griskins, haslets, feet and ears, brawn, and the like: in the middle there
smoaked a large barbicued hog, which was soon devour'd to the bone; so
desirous was every one to prove his <HI>Christianity</HI> by the quantity
he could swallow of that <HI>Anti-Judaic</HI> food. After dinner there was
brought in, by way of desert, a dish of hogs puddings; but as I have a
dislike to that kind of diet, (though not from any scruple of
conscience,) I was regarded as little better than a <HI>Jew</HI> for
declining to eat of them.</P>
<P>THE great support of this party is an old neighbouring
knight; who, ever since the late naturalization-act, has conceived a violent
antipathy to the <HI>Jews,</HI> and takes every opportunity of railing at the
above-mentioned nobleman. Sir <HI>Rowland</HI> swears that his lordship is
worse than <HI>Judas,</HI> that he is actually circumcised, and that the
chapel in this nobleman's house is turned into a synagogue. The knight had
never been seen in a church, 'till the late clamour about the
<HI>Jew</HI>-bill; but he now attends it regularly every sunday, where he
devoutly takes his nap all the service; and he lately bestowed the best
living in his gift, which he had before promised to his chaplain, on one whom
he had never seen, but had read his name in the title-page to a sermon
against the <HI>Jews.</HI> He turned off his butler, who had lived with him
many years, and whose only crime was a swarthy complexion, because the
dog looked like a <HI>Jew.</HI> He feeds hogs in his park and the court-yard,
and has Guinea-pigs in his parlour. Every saturday he has an hunt, because
it is the <HI>Jewish</HI> subbath; and in the evening he 
<PB N="77" REF="82"/> is sure to get drunk with the vicar in defence of
religion. As he is in the commission, he ordered a poor <HI>Jew</HI>
pedlar, who came to hawk goods at his house, to <HI>Bridewell</HI>; and he
was once going to send a little parish-boy to the same place, for
presuming to play in his worship's hearing on that unchristian-like
instrument the <HI>Jews-Harp.</HI></P>
<P>THE fair sex here are no less ambitious of displaying
their affection for the same cause, and they manifest their sentiments
by the colour and fashion of their dress. Their zeal more particularly
shews itself in a variety of posies for rings, buckles, knots, and
garters. I observed the other night at the assembly, that the ladies
seemed to vie with each other in hanging out the ensigns of their faith in
orthodox ribbands, bearing the inscription of NO JEWS, CHRISTIANITY FOR EVER.
They likewise wore little crosses at their breasts; their
<HI>pompons</HI> were formed into crucifixes, their knots disposed in the
same angles, and so many parts of their habits moulded into that shape,
that the whole assembly looked like the court on St. <HI>Andrew</HI>'s day.
It was remarkable that the vicar's lady, who is a thorough-paced
High-Churchwoman, was more religious in the decorations of her dress than any
of the company: in a word, she was so stuck over from head to foot with
crosses, that a wag justly compared her to an old <HI>Popish</HI>
tomb-stone in a <HI>Gothic</HI> cathedral.</P>
<P>I SHALL now conclude my letter with the relation of an
adventure, that happened to myself at my first coming into this town. I
intended to put up at the <HI>Catherine-Wheel,</HI> as I had often used the
house before, and knew the landlord to be a good civil kind of fellow. I
accordingly turned my horse into the yard, when to my great surprize the
landlord, as soon as he saw me, gave me an hearty <PB N="78" REF="83"/>
curse, and told me I might go about my business, 
<Q REND="inline">"for in∣deed he would not entertain any such
rascals."</Q> Upon this he said something to two or three strapping
country-fellows, who immediately came towards me, and if I had not rode away
directly, I should have met with a very rough salutation from their
horse-whips. I could not ima∣gine what offence I had commited, that could
give occa∣sion for such ill usage, 'till I heard the master of the inn
hollowing after me 
<Q REND="inline">"that's the scoundrel that came here some
time ago with <HI>Tom T'otherside</HI>;"</Q> who, I have since learnt, is
an agent for the other party.</P>

<OPENER>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>S the ladies are naturally become the im∣mediate objects of
your care, will you permit a complaint to be inserted in your paper, which is
founded upon a matter of fact? They will pardon me, if by laying before you a
particular instance I was lately witness to of their im∣proper behaviour, I
endeavour to expose a reigning evil which subjects them to many shameful
imputations.</P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="85"/>I RECEIVED last week a dinner-card from
a friend, with an intimation that I should meet some very agreeable ladies.
At my arrival I found that the company consisted chiefly of females, who
indeed did me the honour to rise, but quite disconcerted me in paying my
respects by their whispering each other and appearing to stifle a laugh.
When I was seated, the ladies grouped themselves up in a corner, and
entered into a private cabal, seemingly to discourse upon points of great
secresy and importance, but of equal merriment and diversion.</P>
<P>THE same conduct of keeping close to their ranks was
observed at table, where the ladies seated themselves together. Their
conversation was here also confined wholly to them∣selves, and seemed
like the mysteries of the <HI>Bona Dea,</HI> in which men were forbidden to
have any share. It was a continued laugh and a whisper from the beginning
to the end of dinner. A whole sentence was scarce ever spoken aloud.
Single words indeed now and then broke forth; such as <HI>odious, horrible,
detestable, shocking,</HI> HUMBUG. This last new-coined expression,
which is only to be found in the nonsensical vocabulary, sounds absurd
and disagreeable when∣ever it is pronounced; but from the mouth of a lady it
is 
<Q REND="inline">"shocking, detestable, horrible, and
odious."</Q></P>
<P>MY friend seemed to be but in an uneasy situation at his
own table: but I was far more miserable. I was mute, and seldom dared to
lift up my eyes from my plate, or turn my head to call for small beer, lest
by some aukward posture I might draw upon me a whisper or a laugh.
<HI>Sancho,</HI> when he was forbid to eat of a delicious banquet set before
him, could scarce appear more melancholy. The rueful length of my face might
possibly encrease the mirth of my tormen∣tors: at least their joy
seemed to rise in exact proportion with <PB N="81" REF="86"/> my misery.
At length, however, the time of my delivery approached. Dinner ended, the
ladies made their exits in pairs, and went off hand in hand, whispering like
the two Kings of <HI>Brentford.</HI></P>
<P>MODEST men, Mr. TOWN, are deeply wounded, when they imagine
themselves the objects of ridicule or contempt; and the pain is the greater,
when it is given by those whom they admire, and from whom they are ambitious
of receiving any marks of countenance and favour. Yet we must allow that
affronts are pardonable from ladies, as they are often prognostics of future
kindness. If a lady strikes our cheek, we can very willingly follow the
precept of the Gospel, and turn the other cheek to be smitten. Even a blow
from a fair hand conveys pleasure:—but this battery of whispers is
against all legal rights of war;—poisoned arrows, and stabs in the
dark, are not more repugnant to the general laws of humanity.</P>
<P>MODERN writers of comedy often introduce a pert wit∣ling into
their pieces, who is very severe upon the rest of the company; but all his
waggery is spoken <HI>aside.</HI> These giglers and whisperers seem
to be acting the same part in company, that this arch rogue does in the play.
Every word or motion produces a train of whispers; the dropping of a
snuff-box, or spilling the tea, is sure to be accompanied with a titter;
and upon the entrance of any one with something particular in his person or
manner, I have seen a whole room in a buzz like a bee-hive.</P>
<P>THIS practise of whispering, if it is any where allowable,
may perhaps be indulged the fair sex at church, where the conversation can
only be carried on by the secret symbols of a curtsy, an ogle, or a nod.
A whisper in this place is very <PB N="82" REF="87"/> often of great use, as
it serves to convey the most secret intel∣ligence, which a lady would be
ready to burst with, if she could not find vent for it by this kind of
auricular confession. A piece of scanda1 transpires in this manner from
one pew to another, then presently whizzes along the chancel, from whence it
crawls up to the galleries, till at last the whole church hums with it.</P>
<P>IT were also to be wished, that the ladies would be
pleased to confine themselves to whispering in their <HI>tête
à tête</HI> conferences at an opera or the play-house; which
would be a proper deference to the rest of the audience. In <HI>France,</HI>
we are told, it is common for the <HI>Parterre</HI> to join with the performers
in any favourite air; but we seem to have carried this custom still
further, as our boxes, without concerning themselves in the least with the
play, are even louder than the players. The wit and humour of a
<HI>Vanbrugh</HI> is frequently interrupted by a brilliant dialogue between two
persons of fashion; and a love-scene in the side-box has often been
more attended to than that on the stage. As to their loud bursts of
laughter at the theatre, they may very well be excused, when they are excited
by any lively strokes in a comedy: but I have seen our ladies titter at the
most distressful scenes in <HI>Romeo</HI> and <HI>Juliet,</HI> grin
over the anguish of a <HI>Monimia</HI> or <HI>Belvidera,</HI> and fairly
laugh King <HI>Lear</HI> off the stage.</P>
<P>THUS the whole behaviour of these ladies is in direct
con∣tradiction to good manners. They laugh when they should cry, are loud
when they should be silent, and are silent when their conversation is
desirable. If a man in a select company was thus to laugh or whisper me
out of countenance, I should be apt to construe it as an affront, and
demand an explanation. As to the ladies, I would desire them to reflect how
much <PB N="83" REF="88"/> they would suffer, if their own weapons were turned
against them, and the gentlemen should attack them with the same arts of
laughing and whispering. But, however free they may be from our resentment,
they are still open to ill-natured suspicions. They do not consider,
what strange constructions may be put on these laughs and whispers. It
were, indeed, of little consequence, if we only imagined that they were
taking the reputations of their acquaintance to pieces, or abusing the
company round; but when they indulge them∣selves in this behaviour, some
perhaps may be led to conclude, that they are discoursing upon topics,
which they are afraid or ashamed to speak of in a less private
manner.</P>
<P>IF the misconduct which I have described had been only to
be found, Mr. TOWN, at my friend's table, I should not have troubled you with
this letter: but the same kind of ill-breeding prevails too often and in too
many places. The giglers and the whisperers are innumerable; they beset us
wherever we go; and it is observable, that after a short murmur of
whispers out comes the burst of laughter:—like a gun-powder
serpent, which, after hissing about for some time, goes off in a
bounce.</P>
<P>SOME excuse may perhaps be framed for this ill-timed
merriment in the fair sex. <HI>Venus,</HI> the goddess of beauty, is
frequently called the <HI>laughter-loving dame</HI>; and by laughing our modern
ladies may possibly imagine, that they render themselves like
<HI>Venus.</HI> I have indeed remarked, that the ladies commonly adjust their
laugh to their persons, and are merry in proportion as it sets off their
particular charms. One lady is never further moved than to a smile or a
simper, be∣cause nothing else shows her dimples to so much advantage;
another, who has a very fine set of teeth, runs into the broad grin; while a
third, who is admired for a well-turned <PB N="84" REF="89"/> neck and graceful
chest, calls up all her beauties to view by breaking out in violent and
repeated peals of laughter.</P>
<P>I WOULD not be understood to impose gravity or too great a
reserve on the fair sex. Let them laugh at a feather, but let them declare
openly that it is a feather which occasions their mirth. I must confess,
that laughter becomes the young, the gay, and the handsome: but a whisper
is unbe∣coming at all ages and in both sexes; nor ought it ever to be
practised, except in the round gallery at St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s, or in the
famous whispering place in <HI>Gloucester</HI> cathedral, where two
whisperers hear each other at the distance of five and twenty yards.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG> FRIEND of mine who belongs to the Stamp-Office acquaints me,
that the revenue arising from the duty on cards and dice continues to
increase every year, and that it now brings in near six times more than it
did at first. This will not appear very wonderful, when we consider that
gaming is now become rather the business than amuse∣ment of our persons
of quality; that their whole attention is employed in this important article,
and that they are more concerned about the transactions of the two clubs at
<HI>White</HI>'s than the proceedings of both Houses of Parliament. Thus it
happens that estates are now almost as frequently made over by whist and
hazard as by deeds and settlements; and <PB N="86" REF="91"/> the chariots of
many of our nobility may be said (like Count <HI>Basset</HI>'s in the
play) 
<Q REND="inline">"to roll upon the four aces."</Q></P>
<P>THIS love of gaming has taken such entire possession
of their ideas, that it infects their common conversation. The management of
a dispute was formerly attempted by reason and argument; but the new way of
adjusting all difference in opinion is by the sword or a wager: so that
the only gen∣teel method of dissent is to risk a thousand pounds, or
take your chance of being run through the body. The strange custom of
deciding every thing by a wager is so universal, that if (in imitation of
<HI>Swift)</HI> any body was to publish a specimen of <HI>Polite
Conversation,</HI> instead of old sayings and trite repar∣tees he would
in all probability fill his dialogues with little more than bet after bet, or
now and then a calculation of the odds.</P>
<P>WHITE's, the present grand scene of these transactions
was formerly distinguished by gallantry and intrigue. During the
publication of the <HI>Tatler,</HI> Sir <HI>Richard Steel</HI> thought pro∣per
to date all his love-news from that quarter: but it would now be as absurd to
pretend to gather any such intelligence from <HI>White</HI>'s; as to send
to <HI>Batson</HI>'s for a lawyer, or to the <HI>Roll</HI>'s Coffee-house
for a man-midwife.</P>
<P>THE gentlemen who now frequent this place profess a kind of
universal Scepticism; and as they look upon every thing as dubious, put the
issue upon a wager. There is no∣thing however trivial or ridiculous, which
is not capable of producing a bet. Many pounds have been lost upon the colour
of a coach-horse, an article in the news, or the change of the weather. The
birth of a child has brought great ad∣vantages to persons not in the least
related to the family it was born in; and the breaking off a match has affected
many in their fortunes, besides the parties immediately concerned.</P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="92"/>BUT the most extraordinary part of this
fashionable practice is what in the gaming dialect is called, <HI>pitting one
man against another</HI>; that is, in plain English, wagering which of the
two will live longest. In this manner people of the most opposite
characters make up the subject of a bet. A player perhaps is pitted against
a duke, an alderman against a bishop, or a pimp with a privy-counsellor.
There is scarce one remarkable person, upon whose life there are not many
thousand pounds depending, or one person of quality whose death will not
leave several of these kinds of mortgages upon his estate. The various
changes in the health of one, who is the subject of many bets, occasions
very se∣rious reflections in those who have ventured large sums on his
life and death. Those who would be gainers by his decease, upon every
flight indisposition, watch all the stages of his illness, and are as
impatient for his death, as the undertaker who expects to have the care of his
funeral; while the other side are very sollicitous about his recovery,
send every hour to know how he does, and take as much care of him, as a
clergyman's wife does of her husband who has no other fortune than his
living. I remember a man with the constitution of a porter, upon whose life
very great odds were laid; but when the person he was pitted against was
expected to dye every week, this man unexpectedly shot himself through the
head, and the know∣ing ones were taken in.</P>
<P>THOUGH most of our follies are imported from <HI>France,</HI>
this has had its rise and progress entirely in <HI>England.</HI> In the
last illness of <HI>Louis</HI> the fourteenth Lord <HI>Stair</HI> laid a
wager on his death; and we may guess what the <HI>French</HI> thought of it,
from the manner in which <HI>Voltaire</HI> mentions it in his <HI>Siécle
de Louis</HI> xiv. 
<Q REND="inline">"Le Roi fut attaquè vers le milieu 
<PB N="88" REF="93"/> mois d'Août. Le Comte de Stair Ambassadeur
d'Angle∣terre PARIA, <HI>selon le genie de sa nation,</HI> que le Roi ne
passeroit pas le mois de Septembre."</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">"The King, says he, was taken ill about the
middle of August; when Lord <HI>Stair,</HI> the ambassador from
<HI>England</HI> BETTED, <HI>according to the genius of his nation,</HI> that
the King would not live beyond September.</Q></P>
<P>I AM in some pain lest this custom should get among the
ladies. They are at present very deep in cards and dice; and while my lord is
gaming abroad, her ladyship has her rout at home. I am inclined to
suspect that our women of fashion will also learn to divert
themselves with this polite practice of laying wagers. A birthday suit, the
age of a beauty, who invented a particular fashion, or who were suppos'd to
be together at the last masquerade, would frequently give occasion for
bets. This would also afford them a new method for the ready propagation of
scandal, as the truth of several stories which are continually flying
about the town would naturally be brought to the same test. Should they
proceed further to stake the lives of their acquaintance against each
other, they would doubtless bet with the same fearless spirit as they
are known to do at brag: one husband perhaps would be pitted against
another, or a woman of the town against a maid of honour. In a word, if this
once becomes fashionable among the ladies, we shall soon see the time,
when an allowance for <HI>bet-money</HI> will be stipulated in the Marriage
Articles.</P>
<P>AS the vices and follies of persons of distinction are very
apt to spread, I am much afraid lest this branch of gaming should
descend to the common people. Indeed it seems already to have got among
them. We have frequent <PB N="89" REF="94"/> accounts in the daily papers of
tradesmen riding, walking, eating and drinking for a wager. The contested
election in the city has occasioned several extraordinary bets: I know a
butcher in <HI>Leadenball</HI> market, who laid an ox to a shin of beef on
the success of Sir <HI>John Barnard</HI> against the field; and have been
told of a Publican in <HI>Thames</HI> street, who ventured an hogshead of
intire butt on the candi∣date who serves him with beer.</P>
<P>WE may observe that the spirit of gaming displays itself
with as much variety among the lowest as the highest order of people. It is
the same thing, whether the dice rattle in an orange barrow or at the Hazard
table. A couple of chairmen in a night-cellar are as eager at put or all-fours,
as a party at St. <HI>James</HI>'s at a rubber of whist; and the E. O. table
is but an higher sort of <HI>Merry-go-round,</HI> where you may get six
halfpence for one, six pence for one, and six twopences for one. If the
practise of pitting should be also propagated among the vulgar, it will
be common for prize∣fighters to stake their lives against each other, and
two pickpockets may lay which of them shall first go to the gallows.</P>
<P>TO give the reader a full idea of one wholly employed in this
manner, I shall conclude my paper with the character <HI>Montano.
Montano</HI> was born heir to a nobleman remark∣able for deep play, from whom
he very early imbibed the principles of gaming. When he was at school, he was
the most expert of any of his playfellows at taw, and would often strip
them of their whole week's allowance at chuck. He was afterwards at the head of
every match at football or cricket; and when he was captain he made a lottery,
but went away without drawing the prizes. He is still <PB N="90" REF="95"/>
talked of at the school for a famous dispute he had with another of his own
cast about their superiority in learning; which they decided by tossing
up heads or tails who was the best scholar. Being too great a genius for
our universi∣ties at home, he was sent abroad on his travels, but never got
further than <HI>Paris</HI>; where having lost a considerable bet of four
to one concerning the taking a town in <HI>Flanders,</HI> he was obliged to
come back with a few guineas he bor∣rowed to bring him over. Here he soon
became univer∣sally known by frequenting every gaming-table and attend∣ing
every horse-race in the kingdom. He first reduced betting into an art, and
made <HI>White</HI>'s the grand market for wagers. He is at length such an
adept in this art, that whatever turn things take, he can never lose: this he
has effected by what he has taught the world to call <HI>hedging a bet.</HI>
There is scarce an election in the kingdom which will not end to his
advantage; and he has lately sent over commissions to <HI>Paris</HI> to
take up bets on the recall of the parliament. He was the first that struck
out the above∣mentioned practice of pitting, in which he is so thoroughly
versed, that the death of every person of quality may be said to bring
him a legacy; and he has so contrived the bets on his own life, that, live or
die, the odds are in his favour.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">Y</SEG>OUR last week's paper on the subject of Bets put me in
mind of an extract I lately met with in some news papers, from the "Life of
Pope <HI>Sixtus</HI> the Fifth, written by Mr. <HI>Farnworth.</HI>" The
passage is as follows.</P>
<Q>IT was reported in <HI>Rome,</HI> that <HI>Drake</HI> had
taken and plundered St. <HI>Domingo</HI> in <HI>Hispaniola,</HI> and carried
off an immense booty. This account came in a private letter to <HI>Paul
Secchi,</HI> a very considerable merchant in the city, who had large concerns
in those parts, which he had insured. Upon receiving this news, he sent
for the insurer <HI>Samson</HI> <PB N="92" REF="97"/> <HI>Ceneda,</HI> a
Jew, and acquainted him with it. The Jew, whose interest it was to have
such a report thought false, gave many reasons why it could not
possibly be true; and at last worked himself up into such a
passion, that he said I'll lay you a pound of my flesh it is a lye.
<HI>Secchi,</HI> who was of a fiery hot temper, replied, I'll lay you a
thousand crowns against a pound of your flesh, that it is true. The Jew
accepted the wager, and articles were immediately ex∣ecuted betwixt them, That
if <HI>Secchi</HI> won, he should him∣self cut the flesh with a sharp
knife from whatever part of the Jew's body he pleased. The truth of the
account was soon confirmed; and the Jew was almost distracted when he was
informed that <HI>Secchi</HI> had solemnly sworn he would compel him to the
exact literal performance of his contract. A report of this transaction was
brought to the Pope, who sent for the parties, and being informed of the
whole affair, said, 
<Q REND="inline">"When contracts are made, it is just they
should be fulfilled, as this shall. Take a knife therefore,
<HI>Secchi,</HI> and cut a pound of flesh from any part you please of the
Jew's body. We advise you however to be very careful; for if you cut but a
scruple more or less than your due, you shall certainly be
hanged."</Q></Q>
<P>WHAT induced me to trouble you with this is a remark made by
the editor, 
<Q REND="inline">"that the scene between <HI>Shylock</HI> and
<HI>Antonio</HI> in the <HI>Merchant of Venice</HI> is borrowed from this
story."</Q> I should perhaps have acquiesced in this notion, if I had not
seen a note in the "Observations on <HI>Spenser's Faerie Queene</HI>"
just published by Mr. <HI>T. Warton of Trinity College,</HI> where He has
plainly discovered the real source from which <HI>Shakespere</HI> drew
his fable, which He informs us is founded upon an ancient ballad. The admirers
of <HI>Shakespere</HI> are obliged to him for this curious discovery; but
as Mr. <HI>Warton</HI> has only given some extracts, they would undoubtedly
be glad to see the whole. This Ballad is most probably no where to be met
with, but in the <HI>Ashmolean Musaeum</HI> in this University, where it
is preserved by that famous Antiquary <HI>Anthony à Wood:</HI> I have
therefore sent you a faithful tran∣script <PB N="93" REF="98"/> of it; and
you will agree with me that it will do you more credit, as a CONNOISSEUR, to
draw this hidden trea∣sure into light, than if you had discovered an
<HI>Otho</HI> or a <HI>Niger.</HI></P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Shewing the crueltie of GERNUTUS a JEWE, who
lending to a marchant an hundred crownes, would have a pound of his fleshe,
because he could not pay him at the time appointed.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<LG>
<L>IN <HI>Venice</HI> town not long agoe</L>
<L>A cruel Jew did dwell,</L>
<L>Which lived all on usurie,</L>
<L>As Italian writers tell.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>Gernutus</HI> called was the Jew,</L>
<L>Which never thought to die,</L>
<L>Nor never yet did any good</L>
<L>To them in streets that lye.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>His life was like a barrow hogge,</L>
<L>That liveth many a day,</L>
<L>Yet never once doth any good,</L>
<L>Untill men will him slay.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Or like a filthy heap of dung,</L>
<L>That lyeth in a hoord;</L>
<L>Which never can doe any good,</L>
<L>Till it be spread abroad.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>So fares it with this Usurer,</L>
<L>He cannot sleep in rest,</L>
<L>For fear the theefe doth him pursue,</L>
<L>To pluck him from his nest.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>His heart doth thinke on many a wile,</L>
<L>How to deceive the poore;</L>
<L>His mouth is almost full of mucke,</L>
<L>Yet still he gapes for more.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>His wife must lend a shilling,</L>
<L>For every weeke a penny,</L>
<L>Yet bring a pledge that's double worth,</L>
<L>If that you will have any.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And see (likewise) you keepe your day,</L>
<L>Or else you loose it all:</L>
<L>This was the living of his wife,</L>
<L>Her cow she doth it call.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Within that citie dwelt that time</L>
<L>A merchant of great fame,</L>
<L>Which being distressed in his need,</L>
<L>Unto <HI>Gernutus</HI> came:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Desiring him to stand his friend,</L>
<L>For twelve moneth and a day,</L>
<L>To lend to him an hundred crownes,</L>
<L>And he for it would pay</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Whatsoever he would demand of him,</L>
<L>And pledges he should have:</L>
<L>No (qd. the Jew with fleering lookers)</L>
<L>Sir aske what you will have.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>No penny for the loane of it</L>
<L>For one yeere you shall pay;</L>
<L>You may do me as good a turne,</L>
<L>Before my dying day.</L>

<LG>
<L>But we will have a merry jeast</L>
<L>For to be talked long:</L>
<L>You shall make me a bond (quoth he)</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>And this shall be the forfeiture,</L>

<L>With right good will the merchant said,</L>

<L>To thinke he doth begin.</L>

<L>And to <HI>Gernutus</HI> straight he comes</L>

<L>And when the judgment day was come,</L>
<L>For judgment he doth call.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The merchant's friends came thither fast,</L>

<L>Some offered for his hundred crownes</L>

<L>No, no, quoth he, no judgment here</L>
<L>for this it shall be tryde,</L>
<L>For I will have my pound of fleshe</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>It grieved all the companie</L>
<L>His crueltie to see,</L>
<L>For neither friend, nor foe could helpe,</L>
<L>But he must spoyled bee.</L>

<LG>
<L>The bloudie Jew now ready is</L>
<L>With whetted blade in hand,</L>
<L>To spoyle the bloud of innocent,</L>
<L>By forfieth of his bond.</L>

<L>And as he was about to strike</L>
<L>In him the deadly blow:</L>

<L>I charge thee to doe so.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Sith needs thou wilt thy forfeit have,</L>

<LG>
<L>For if thou take either more or lesse,</L>
<L>To the value of a mite,</L>

</TEXT></Q>
<P>IT will be proper to subjoin what the ingenious Mr.
<HI>Warton</HI> has observed upon this subject.— 
<Q REND="inline">'It may be objected, says he, that this
ballad might have been <PB N="95" REF="100"/> written after, and copied from,
<HI>Shakespere</HI>'s play. But if that had been the case, it is most
likely, that the author would have preserved <HI>Shakespere</HI>'s name of
<HI>Shylock</HI> for the Jew; and nothing is more likely, than that
<HI>Shakespere</HI> in copying from this ballad, should alter the name from
<HI>Gernu∣tus</HI> to one more Jewish. Another argument is, that our ballad
has the air of a narrative written before <HI>Shakespere</HI>'s play; I mean,
that, if it had been written after the play, it would have been much more full
and circumstantial: At present, it has too much the nakedness of an
original.'</Q></P>
<P>IT would indeed be absurd to think that this ballad was
taken from <HI>Shakespere</HI>'s play, as they differ in the most
essen∣tial circumstances. The sum borrowed is in the former three
thousand ducats, in the latter an hundred crowns: the time limited for
payment in the one is only three months, in the other a year and a day: In the
play the merchant's motive for borrowing, (which is finely imagined by
<HI>Shakespere,</HI> and is conducive to the general plot,) is not on account
of his own necessities, but for the service of his friend. To th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> we may add, that the close of the story is finely
height∣ened by <HI>Shakespere.</HI> A mere copyist, such as we may
suppose a balladmonger, would not have given himself the trouble to alter
circumstances: at least he would not have changed them so much for the
worse. But this matter seems to be placed out of all doubt by the first
stanza of the ballad, which in∣forms us that the story was taken from
some Italian novel. 
<Q REND="inline">'Thus much therefore is certain, (as Mr.
<HI>Warton</HI> observes) that <HI>Shakespere</HI> either copied from that
Italian novel, or from this ballad: Now we have no translation, I presume,
of such a novel into English; if then it be granted that
<HI>Shakespere</HI> generally took his Italian stories from their
En∣glish translations, and that the arguments above, concerning the prior
antiquity of this ballad are true, it will follow that <HI>Shakespere</HI>
copied from this ballad.'</Q></P>
<P>UPON the whole it is very likely that the <HI>Italian</HI>
novel, upon which this ballad seems founded, took its rise (with an 
<PB N="96" REF="101"/> inversion of the circumstances) from the
abovementioned story in "The Life of Pope <HI>Sixtus</HI> the Fifth," the
memory of which must have been then recent. I should be glad if any of your
readers can give any further light into this affair, and, if possible,
acquaint the Public, from whence <HI>Shakespere</HI> borrowed the other part
of his fable concerning <HI>Portia and the Caskets</HI>; which it is more
than probable is drawn from some other novel well known in his time.</P>
<P>I CANNOT conclude without remarking with what art and judgment
<HI>Shakespere</HI> have wove together these different stories of the
<HI>Jew,</HI> and the <HI>Caskets</HI>; from both which he has form∣ed one
general fable, without having recourse to the stale artifice of eking out a
barren subject with impertinent un∣derplots.</P>

<LETTER>
<HEAD>To Mr. TOWN.</HEAD>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HOUGH many historians have described the City of
<HI>London</HI> (in which we may in∣clude <HI>Westminster</HI>) with great
accuracy, yet they have not set it out in the full light, which at present
it deserves. They have not distinguished it as an University.
<HI>Paris</HI> is an University, <HI>Dublin</HI> is an University, even
<HI>Moscow</HI> is an University. But <HI>London</HI> has not yet been
honoured with that Title. I will allow our Metropolis to have been intended
originally, only as a City of Trade, and I will farther own that scarce any
Sciences, except such as were purely mercantile, were cultivated in it 'till
within these last thirty years; but from <PB N="98" REF="103"/> period of
time, I may say an whole army, as it were, of Arts and Sciences have marched
amicably in upon us, and have fixed themselves as auxiliaries to our
Capitol.</P>
<P>THE four greater faculties, I mean Theology, Law, Me∣dicine,
and Philosophy, which are taught in other Univer∣sities, are in their
highest perfection here. The prosperity of the first may be seen by the
crouded churches every Sun∣day, and the discipline of the second by the
numberless young Students who constantly dine in their respective halls
at the several inns of court. These two faculties have of late received
considerable improvements, but particularly that of Theology, as is
manifest from several new and asto∣nishing opinions which have been
started among us. There have risen, within these few years, very numerous
tribes of Methodists, Moravians, Middletonians, Hutchinsonians, &amp;c. in
a word our sects are multiplied to such an infinite de∣gree, that (as
<HI>Voltaire</HI> has before observed) every Man may now go to heaven his own
way. Can the Divinity Schools boast such sound doctrine as the Foundery
in <HI>Moorfields?</HI> or were ever fellows of colleges such adepts in
Matri∣mony as the reverend doctors of the <HI>Fleet,</HI> or the primate of
<HI>May-Fair?</HI></P>
<P>THE theory of Medicine may undoubtedly be taught at
<HI>Oxford</HI> and <HI>Cambridge</HI> in a tolerable manner, but the art
itself can only be learnt, where it flourishes, at <HI>London.</HI> Do not
our daily papers give us a longer list of medicines than are contained in any
of the Dispensatories? And are we not constantly told of surprizing
antidotes, certain cures, and never failing remedies for every complaint, and
are not each of these specifies equally efficacious in one distemper as
another, from the grand restorative elixir of life down to the insallible
corn salve? With what pleasure and admiration <PB N="99" REF="104"/> have I
beheld the <HI>Machaon</HI> of our times Dr. <HI>Richard Rock</HI>
dispensing from his one-horse-chaise his cathartic antivene∣real
electuary, his itch powder, and his quintessence of vi∣pers! It may be
asked, is he a graduate? Is he a regular physician? no, he is superior to
regularity. He despises the formality of academical degrees. He stiles
himself M. L. He is a London Physician, or as <HI>Moliere</HI> would
express it, <HI>C' est un Medecin de Londres.</HI></P>
<P>AFTER Medicine let us consider Logic. How is that most
useful art taught in the two Universities? Is it not clogged with such
barbarous terms, as tend to puzzle and confound, rather than enlighten or
direct the understanding? Is it not taught in a dead, I had almost said
in a popish Tongue? Is it not overrun with dry distinctions, and
useless subtleties? Where then is it to be learnt in all the purity of
reason, and the dignity of language? Neither at <HI>Oxford</HI> nor at
<HI>Cambridge,</HI> but at the Robin Hood Alehouse in Butcher Row, near
Temple Bar.</P>
<P>FROM Logic let us proceed to Eloquence: And let us
ingenuously confess that neither of our Universities can boast an
orator equal to the renown'd <HI>Henley.</HI> Has he not all the qualifications
required by <HI>Tully</HI> in a complete Orator? Has he not been followed by
the greatest men of the nation? Yet has this modest divine never derived
any title to himself from his own rhetoric, except such an one as his
extraordi∣nary elocution naturally bestowed upon him. Might he not have
called himself <HI>President</HI> of the Butchers? <HI>Dean</HI> of
Marrowbones and Cleavers? or <HI>Warden</HI> of <HI>Clare Market?</HI>
certainly he might. Therefore if it were for his sake only, in my humble
opinion, London ought immediately to assume the title of an University;
and the Butchers of Clare Market, who have so constantly attended Mr.
<HI>Henley</HI>'s Lectures, ought to be presented with honorary degrees.</P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="105"/>I KNOW not what pretensions the
Universities may have had originally to adopt <HI>Music</HI> among the
rest of their Sciences: perhaps they have assumed a right of bestowing
Degrees in <HI>Music,</HI> from their being called the seats of the
Muses; as it is well known that <HI>Apollo</HI> was a fidler as well as a
poet and physician; and the Muses are said to have delighted in fidling
and piping. The young students, I am told, of either University are more
ambitious to excel in this science than any other, and spend most of
their time in the study of the <HI>Gamut:</HI> but their knowledge in
<HI>Har∣monics</HI> is seldom carried farther than <HI>I love Sue,</HI> or
<HI>Ally Croker.</HI> In this point <HI>London</HI> has undoubtedly a better
title to be called an University. Did <HI>Oxford</HI> or <HI>Cambridge</HI>
ever produce an Opera, though they have the advantage of languages so very
little known as the <HI>Greek</HI> and even <HI>Hebrew</HI> to compose in?
Had ever any of their professors the least idea of a Burletta? or are any
of their most sublime anthems half so ravishing as <HI>Foote's
Minuet</HI> from the hand-organ of the little <HI>Savoyard Dutchess?</HI> Are
those classical instruments the <HI>Doric Lute,</HI> the
<HI>Syrinx,</HI> or the <HI>Fistula,</HI> to be compared to the melody of the
<HI>Wooden Spoons,</HI> the <HI>Jews Harp</HI> and <HI>Salt-Box</HI> at Mrs.
<HI>Midnight</HI>'s?</P>
<P>BUT there is no doctrines more forcibly inculcated among us
than those of <HI>Ethics,</HI> or moral Philosophy. What are the precepts
of <HI>Plato, Epictetus,</HI> or <HI>Tully</HI> in comparison to the moral
lessons delivered by our periodical writers? And are not you, Mr. TOWN, a
wiser man than <HI>Socrates?</HI> But the age is more particularly indebted,
for it's present uni∣versal purity of manners, to those excellent rules
for the conduct of life contained in our modern novels. From these moral
works might be compiled an entire new system of Ethics, far superior to
the exploded notions of musty <HI>Aca∣demics,</HI> and adapted to the
practise of the present times. <PB N="101" REF="106"/> <HI>Cato,</HI> we are
told, commended a young man who he saw coming out of the publick stews,
because he imagined it might preserve him from the crime of adultery; and
the <HI>Spartans</HI> used to make their slaves drunk in the presence of
their youth, that they might be deterred from the like debaucheries. For the
same reasons we may suppose that our taverns and bagnios are so much
frequented by our young people, and in this light we may fairly consider them
as so many <HI>schools of Moral Philosophy.</HI></P>
<P>IF we are willing to turn our thoughts towards Expe∣rimental
Philosophy, can the several Universities of the whole world produce
such a variety of instruments, so ju∣diciously collected, for
astronomical, geographical, and all other scientific observations, as are
to be seen in the two amazing repositories of Mr. Professor
<HI>Deard</HI> in the <HI>Strand,</HI> and of Mr. Professor Russel at
<HI>Charing Cross?</HI> It were endless to enumerate particulars; but I
cannot help ta∣king notice of those elegant little portable telescopes,
that are made use of in all public places; by which it is evident that even
our fine ladies and gentlemen are become pro∣ficients in <HI>Optics.</HI></P>
<P>THE Universities seem to pride themselves greatly on
their choice collections of curious and invaluable trifles, which are there
preserved, only because they were not thought worth preserving any where
else. But is the <HI>Ash∣molean</HI> collection of rarities comparable to
the nicknackatory of Mr. <HI>Pinchbeck?</HI> or are any of their Musaeums
stored with such precious curiosities, as are frequently seen in Mr.
<HI>Langford</HI>'s Auction-Room? Strangers, who think it worth while to go
so far as <HI>Oxford</HI> or <HI>Cambridge</HI> to see sights, may
surely meet with as much satisfaction at <HI>London.</HI> Are the two
little Pigmies striking a clock at <HI>Carsax</HI> within 
<PB N="102" REF="107"/> any degree of comparison with the two noble Giants at
St. <HI>Dunstan's</HI> church in <HI>Fleet Street</HI>; to say nothing of
their enormous brethren at <HI>Guildhall?</HI> Are any of the College Halls in
either of the Universities so magnificent as those belonging to our
worshipful companies? or can the Theatre at <HI>Oxford,</HI> or the
Senate-house at <HI>Cambridge,</HI> vie with that stupendous piece of
architecture the Mansion House, set apart for our Chancellor the Lord
Mayor? It may be al∣ledged perhaps that these are trifling examples of
superiority, which the younger sister bears over her two elder; but at
the same time it cannot be denied, that she excells them both even in the
minutiae of learning and antiquity.</P>
<P>I MUST confess that Hydraulics, or the motion of Fluids,
seem to be taught exactly in the same manner, and with the same degree of
knowledge, in <HI>London</HI> as in <HI>Oxford</HI> or <HI>Cambridge.</HI> The
glass Tubes, and the Syphons, are formed very much in the same shape and
fashion. The great hydrostatical law, 
<Q REND="inline">"That all fluids gravitate in <HI>proprio
loco,</HI>"</Q> is proved by the same kind of experiments. The several
students, of whatever age or station, vie with each other in an unwearied
application, and a constant attendance to this branch of mixed Mathematics.
The Professors in each of the three Universities, are confessedly
very great men: but I hope I may be forgiven if I wish to see my friend Mr.
<HI>Ryan,</HI> President of the <HI>King's Arms</HI> in <HI>Pall Mall,</HI>
una∣nimously declared Vice Chancellor of the University of
<HI>London.</HI></P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>N information was the other day laid before a magistrate by
a Fellow of the Society of Antiquarians against one of his brethren for a
robbery. The prosecutor deposed upon oath, that the other called upon him
to see his collection of medals, and took an opportunity of stealing a
leather purse formerly belonging to the cele∣brated <HI>Tom Hearne,</HI> in
which were contained, (besides an antique piece of copper-money, place, date,
name, figure, and value unknown) a pair of breeches of <HI>Oliver
Cromwell,</HI> a <HI>Denarius</HI> of <HI>Trajan</HI> worth fifty shillings,
and a Queen <HI>Anne</HI>'s farthing value five pounds. He was with much ado
dissuaded from carrying on his suit, as the magistrate 
<PB N="104" REF="109"/> convinced him, that however highly he might rate his own
treasures, a jury, who were no <HI>Virtuosi,</HI> would con∣sider a
farthing merely as a farthing, and look upon a copper coin of a <HI>Roman
Emperor</HI> as no better than a King <HI>George</HI>'s half-penny.</P>
<P>I CANNOT indeed, without great concern, as a CON∣NOISSEUR,
reflect on the known dishonesty of my learned brethren. Their scandalous
practises, wherever their darling passion is interested, are too
notorious to be denied. The moment they conceive a love for rarities and
antiques, their strict notions of honour disappear; and Taste, the more
it establishes their veneration for <HI>Virtù,</HI> the more
certainly destroys their integrity; as rust enhances the value of an old
coin by eating up the figure and inscription.</P>
<P>MOST people are masters of a kind of Logic, by which they
argue their consciences to sleep, and acquit themselves of doing what is
wrong. The country 'squire, of confirmed honesty in all other respects,
thinks it very fair to over∣reach you in the sale of a horse; the man of
pleasure, who would scorn to pick your pocket, or stop you on the road,
regards it rather as gallantry than baseness to intrigue with your wife or
daughter; while the pick-pocket and highwayman value themselves on their
honour in being true to the gang. In the same manner the <HI>Virtuoso</HI>
does not look on his thefts as real acts of felony, but while he owns that he
would take any pains to steal an old rusty piece of brass, boasts that
you may safely trust him with untold gold: though he would break open your
cabinet for a shell or a butterfly, he would not attempt to force your
escritoire or your strong box; nor would he offer the least violence to
your wife or daughter, though perhaps he would run away with the little finger
of the <HI>Venus de Medicis.</HI> <PB N="105" REF="110"/> Upon these
principles he proceeds, and lays hold of all opportunities to increase his
collection of rarities: and as <HI>Mahomet</HI> established his religion by
the sword, the <HI>Connoisseur</HI> enlarges his Musaeum, and adds to
his store of knowledge, by fraud and petty larceny.</P>
<P>IF the libraries and cabinets of the curious were, like the
peacock in the fable, to be stripped of their borrowed ornaments, we should
in many see nothing but bare shelves and empty drawers. I know a medalist
who at first set up with little more than a paltry series of English
coins since the Reformation, which he had the good luck to pick up at their
intrinsic value. By a pliant use of his fingers he soon became
possest of most of the <HI>Traders,</HI> and by the same slight of
hand he in a short time after made himself master of great part of the
<HI>Caesars.</HI> He was once taken up for coining; a forge, a crucible, and
several dies being found in his cellar: but he was acquitted, as there was no
law which made it high-treason to counterfeit the image of a
<HI>Tiberius</HI> or a <HI>Nero</HI>; and the coin which he imitated was
current only among <HI>Virtuosos.</HI></P>
<P>I REMEMBER another, who picqued himself on his collection of
scarce editions and original manuscripts, most of which he had purloined
from the libraries of others. He was continually borrowing books of his
acquaintance, with a resolution never to return them. He would send in a
great hurry for a particular edition, which he wanted to consult only for a
moment; but when it was asked for again, he was not at home, or he had lent
it to another, or he had lost it, or he could not find it; and sometimes he
would not scruple to swear, that he had himself delivered it into the
owner's hands. He would frequently spoil a set by stealing a volume, and
then purchase the rest for <PB N="106" REF="111"/> a trifle. After his death
his library was sold by auction; and many of his friends bought up their own
books at an exorbitant price.</P>
<P>A THOROUGHBRED <HI>Virtuoso</HI> will surmount all
scruples of conscience, or encounter any danger to serve his pur∣pose.
Most of them are chiefly attached to some particular branch of knowledge,
but I remember one who was passionately fond of every part of
<HI>Virtù.</HI> At one time, when he could find no other way of carrying
off a medal, he run the risk of being choaked by swallowing it, and at
another broke his leg in scaling a garden wall for a tulip∣root. But nothing
gave him so much trouble and diffi∣culty as the taking away pictures and
antient marbles; which being heavy and unwieldy, he often endangered his life
to gratify his curiosity. He was once locked up all night in the Duke of
<HI>Tuscany</HI>'s gallery, where he took out an original painting of
<HI>Raphael,</HI> and dextrously placed a copy of it in the frame. At
<HI>Venice</HI> he turned Roman Catholic, and became a Jesuit, in order to
get admittance into a convent, from whence he stole a fine head of
<HI>Ignatius Loyola</HI>; and at <HI>Constantinople</HI> he had almost
formed a re∣solution of qualifying himself for the Seraglio, that he might
find means to carry off a picture of the Grand Signior's chief
mistress.</P>
<P>THE general dishonesty of <HI>Connoisseurs</HI> is
indeed so well known, that the strictest precaution is taken to guard
a∣gainst it. Medals are secured under lock and key, pictures screwed to
the walls, and books chained to the shelves; yet cabinets, galleries, and
libraries are continually plundered. Many of the maimed statues at
<HI>Rome</HI> perhaps owe their present ruinous condition to the depredations
made on them by <HI>Virtuosos:</HI> the head of <HI>Henry</HI> the Fifth 
<PB N="107" REF="112"/> in <HI>Westminster Abby</HI> was in all probability
stolen by a <HI>Connoisseur</HI>; and I know one who has at different
times pilfered a great part of Queen <HI>Catherine</HI>'s bones, and hopes in a
little while to be master of the whole skeleton. This gentleman has been
detected in so many little thefts, that he has for several years past
been refused admittance into the Musaeums of the curious; and he is lately
gone abroad with a design upon the ancient <HI>Greek</HI> manuscripts
lately discovered at <HI>Herculaneum.</HI></P>
<P>IT may seem surprizing that these gentlemen should have
hitherto been suffered to escape unpunished for their repeated thefts,
and that a <HI>Virtuoso</HI> who robs you of an <HI>Unic</HI> of
inestimable value should even glory in the action, while a poor dog who
picks your pocket of sixpence shall be hanged for it. What a shocking
disgrace would be brought upon Taste, should we ever see the dying
speech, confession, and behaviour of a <HI>Connoisseur</HI> related
in the Account of Malefactors by the Ordinary of <HI>Newgate!</HI> Such an
accident would doubtless bring the study of <HI>Virtù</HI> into
still more contempt among the ignorant, when they found that it only brought
a man to the gallows; as the country fellow, when he saw an attorney stand
in the pillory for forgery, shook his head, and cried, 
<Q REND="inline">"Ay, this comes of your writing and
reading."</Q> It were perhaps worthy the consideration of the legislature
to devise some punish∣ment for these offenders, which should bear
some analogy with their crimes; and as common malefactors are delivered to
the surgeons to be anatomized, I would propose that a
<HI>Connoisseur</HI> should be made into a Mummy, and preserved in the
Hall of the Royal Society, for the terror and admiration of his brethren.</P>
<P><PB N="108" REF="113"/>I SHALL conclude this paper with the
relation of a circumstance which fell within my own knowledge when I was
abroad, and in which I declined a glorious opportu∣nity of signalizing
myself as a <HI>Connoisseur.</HI> While I was at <HI>Rome</HI> a young
physician of our party, who was eaten up with <HI>Virtù,</HI> made a
serious proposal to us of breaking into St. <HI>Peter</HI>'s by night, and
taking away the famous painting over the altar-piece. As I had not quite
Taste enough to come at once into his scheme, I could not help objecting to
him that it was a robbery. <HI>Poh,</HI> says he, <HI>it is a most
exquisite picture!</HI>—Ay, but it is not only a robbery, but
sacrilege.—<HI>Oh it is a most charming piece!</HI>—Zouns,

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> HAVE selected the following letters from a great number
which I have lately been favoured with from unknown correspon∣dents; and as
they both relate nearly to the same subject, I shall without further
preface submit them to the public.</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>To Mr. TOWN.</HEAD>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHEN you was got into <HI>White</HI>'s, I was in hopes that
you would not have confin'd yourself merely to the gaming-table, but have
given us an account of the entertainment at their ordinaries. A bill of fare
from thence would have been full as diverting to your readers 
<PB N="110" REF="115"/> as the laws of the game, or a list of their bets.
These gen∣tlemen, we are told, are no less adepts in the science of
Eating than of Gaming; and as <HI>Hoyle</HI> has reduc'd the latter into a new
and complete system, I could wish that their cook (who to be sure is a
<HI>Frenchman</HI>) would also oblige the world by a treatise on the Art
and Mystery of Sauces.</P>
<P>INDEED, Mr. TOWN, it surprizes me that you have so long
neglected to make some reflections on the Diet of this great city. Dr.
<HI>Martin Lister,</HI> who was universally allowed to be a great
<HI>Connoisseur,</HI> and published several learned trea∣tises upon
cockle-shells, did not think it beneath him to comment on the works of
<HI>Apicius Caelius,</HI> who had collected together many valuable receipts in
cookery, as practised by the <HI>Romans.</HI> If you would preserve your
papers from the indignity of covering breasts of veal, or wrapping up outlets
<HI>à la Maintenon,</HI> I would advise you to lard them now and then
with the ragouts of <HI>Heliogabalus,</HI> or a parallel between our modern
soups and the <HI>Lacedaemonian</HI> black broth. Your works might then be
universally read, from the mistress in the parlour down to the cookmaid
and scullion.</P>
<P>IT is absolutely necessary for people of all tempers,
com∣plexions, persuasions, habits and stations of life, however they may
differ in other particulars, to concur in the grand article of Eating; and as
the humours of the body arise from the food we take in, the dispositions
of the mind seem to bear an equal resemblance to our places of
refreshment. You have already taken a review of our several
coffee-houses; and I wish you would proceed to delineate the different
cha∣racters that are to be found in our taverns and chop-houses. A friend of
mine always judges of a man of taste and fashion, by asking who is his
peruke-maker, or his taylor? Upon the same principles, when I would form a
just opinion <PB N="111" REF="116"/> any man's temper and inclinations, I
always enquire, where does he dine?</P>
<P>THE difference between the taverns near St. <HI>James</HI>'s
and those about the <HI>'Change</HI> consists not so much in the
costli∣ness as the substance of their viands. The round-bellied
alderman, who breathes the foggy air of the city, requires a more solid diet
than the high kickshaws of our meagre persons of quality. My Lord, or Sir
<HI>John,</HI> after having whiled away an hour or two at the
Parliament-house, drive to the <HI>Star and Garter</HI> to regale on
Macaroni, or pid∣dle with an Ortolan; while the merchant, who has plodded all
the morning in the Alley, sits down to a Turtle-Feast at the <HI>Crown</HI>
or the <HI>King's Arms,</HI> and crams himself with Calipash and Calipee.
As the city taverns are appropriated to men of business, who drive bargains
for thousands over their morning's gill, the taverns about the court are
gene∣rally filled with an insipid race of mortals who have nothing to do.
Among these you may see most of our young men of fashion and young
officers of the guards, who meet at these places to shew the elegance of
their taste by the expensiveness of their dinner; and I know an Ensign
with scarce any income but his commission, who prides him∣self on
keeping the best company, and throws down more than a week's pay for his
reckoning.</P>
<P>THE taverns about the purlieus of <HI>Covent-Garden</HI> are
de∣dicated to <HI>Venus</HI> as well as <HI>Ceres</HI> and <HI>Liber</HI>; and
you may frequently see the jolly messmates of both sexes go in and come
out in couples, like the clean and unclean beasts in <HI>Noah</HI>'s ark.
These houses are equally indebted for their support to the Cook and that
worthy personage whom they have dignified with the title of Pimp. These
gentlemen contrive to play into each other's hands: The first by his 
<PB N="112" REF="117"/> high soups and rich sauces prepares the way for the
occu∣pation of the other, who having reduced the patient by a proper exercise
of his art, returns him back again to go through the same regimen as before.
We may therefore suppose that the culinary arts are no less studied
here than at <HI>White</HI>'s or <HI>Pontac</HI>'s. True geniuses in Eating
will con∣tinually strike out new improvements; but I dare say neither
<HI>Braund</HI> nor <HI>Lebeck</HI> ever made up a more extraordinary dish
than I once remember at the <HI>Castle.</HI> Some bloods being in company
with a celebrated <HI>fille de joye,</HI> one of them pulled off her shoe,
and in excess of gallantry filled it with Champagne, and drank it off to her
health: in this de∣licious draught he was immediately pledged by the rest;
and then, to carry the compliment still further, he ordered it to be drest,
and served up for supper. The cook set him∣self seriously to work
upon it: He pulled the upper part (which was of damask) into fine shreds,
and tossed it up in a ragout; minced the sole; cut the wooden heel into
very thin slices, fried them in butter, and placed them round the dish for
garnish. The company, you may be sure, testi∣fied their affection for the
lady by eating very heartily of this exquisite <HI>impromptu</HI>; and as
this transaction happened just after the <HI>French</HI> King had taken a
cobler's daughter for his mistress, <HI>Tom Pierce</HI> (who has the
stile as well as art of a <HI>French</HI> cook) in his bill politely called
it, in honour of her name, <HI>De soulier á la Murphy.</HI></P>
<P>TAVERNS, Mr. TOWN, seem contrived for the pro∣moting of
luxury; while the humbler Chop-houses are de∣signed only to satisfy the
ordinary cravings of nature. Yet at these you may meet with a variety of
characters: at <HI>Dolly</HI>'s and <HI>Horseman</HI>'s you commonly see
the hearty lovers of a beef-steak and gill ale; and at <HI>Betty</HI>'s and
the chop∣houses about the Inns of Court, a pretty maid is as inviting 
<PB N="113" REF="118"/> as the provisions. In these common refectories you
may always find the jemmy attorney's clerk, the prim curate, the walking
physician, the shabby valet de chambre upon board wages, and the foreign
count or marquis in dishabille, who has refused to dine with a duke or an
ambassador. At a little eating-house in a dark alley behind the
<HI>'Change</HI> I once saw a grave citizen, worth a plumb, order a two-penny
mess of broth with a boiled chop in it: when it was brought him, he scooped
the crumb out of a half-penny roll, and soaked it in the porridge for his
present meal; then carefully placing the chop between the upper and under
crust, he wrapped it up in a checked handkerchief, and carried it off for the
morrow's repast.</P>
<P>I SHALL leave it to you, sir, to make further reflections on
this subject, and should be glad to dine with you at any tavern, dive with
you into any cellar, take a beef-steak in <HI>Ivy lane,</HI> a mutton-chop
behind St. <HI>Clement</HI>'s, or, if you chuse it, an extempore sausage
or black-pudding over the farthing fries at <HI>Moor-Fields</HI> or the

<P>BY <HI>Jove</HI> it is a shame, a burning shame, to see
the honour of <HI>England,</HI> the glory of our nation, the greatest pillar
of life, ROAST BEEF, utterly banished from our tables. This evil, like many
others, has been growing upon us by degrees: it was begun by wickedly placing
the Beef upon a side table, and screening it by a parcel of queue-tailed
fel∣lows in laced waistcoats. However, the odorous effluvia generally
affected the smell of every true <HI>Briton</HI> in the room. The butler was
fatigued with carving: the master of the house grew pale, and sickened at
the sight of those juicy collops of fat and lean that came swimming in
gravy <PB N="114" REF="119"/> and smoaking most deliciously under our
nostrils. Other methods therefore were to be pursued. The Beef was still
served up, but it was brought up cold. It was put upon a table in the
darkest part of the room, and immured between four walls formed artificially
by the servants with the hats of the company. When the jellies and the
slip-slops were coming in, the Beef was carried off in as secret a manner
as if it had gone through the ceremonies of concoction. But still, sir,
under all these disadvantages we had a chance of getting a slice as it
passed by. Now alas! it is not suffered to come up stairs. I dare say
it is generally banished from the steward's table; nor do I suppose
that the powdered footmen will touch it, for fear of dawbing their ruffles. So
that the dish that was served up to the royal tables, the dish that was
the breakfast of Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> and her maids of honour, the dish
that received the dignity of knighthood from King <HI>James</HI> the First,
is now become the food only of scullions and stable-boys. In what words can
I vent my resentment upon this occasion? especially when I reflect that
innovations seldom come alone. Toasted cheese is already buried in
rammekins: plumb-porridge has been long ba∣nished: I tremble for
plumb-pudding. May we not live to see a leg of pork detested as carrion?
and a shoulder of mutton avoided as if it were horse-flesh? Our only
hopes are in the Clergy, and in the Beef-steak Club. The former still
preserve, and probably will preserve, the rectitude of their appetites; and
will do justice to Beef, wherever they find it. The latter (who are
composed of the most ingenious artists in the kingdom) meet every
Saturday in a noble room at the top of <HI>Covent-Garden</HI> theatre, and
never suffer any dish except Beef-steaks to appear. These indeed are
most glorious examples: but what alas! are the weak endeavours of a few to
oppose the daily inroads of fricassees and soup-maigres? This, Mr.
TOWN, is a national concern, as it may prove more destructive to Beef than
the distemper among the horned cattle: and should the modish aversion
against rumps and sirloins continue, it will be absolutely necessary
to enforce the love of Beef by act of parliament.</P>

<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Lady CHARLOTTE,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE been plagued, pestered, teized to death, and hurried
out of my wits, ever since I have been in this odious country. O my dear, how
I long to be in town again! <HI>Pope</HI> and the poets may talk what they will
of their purling streams, shady groves, and flowery meads: but I had rather
live all my days among the cheesemongers shops in <HI>Thames Street,</HI>
than pass such another spring in this filthy country. Would you believe
it? I have scarce touched a card since I have been here; and then there has
been such ado with us about election matters, that I am ready to die with the
vapours: such a rout with their hissing and hollow∣ing, my head is ready
to split into a thousand pieces! If my Sir <HI>John</HI> must be in
parliament, why cannot he do as your lord does, and be content with a borough,
where he might come in without all this trouble; and take his seat in the
house, though he has never been within a hundred miles of the place.</P>
<P>OUR house, my dear, has been a perfect inn, ever since we
came down; and I have been obliged to trudge about as much as a fat landlady.
Our doors are open to every dirty fellow in the county that is worth forty
shillings; all my best floors are spoiled by the hobnails of farmers
stumping about them; every room is a pigstye, and the <HI>Chinese</HI>
paper <PB N="117" REF="122"/> in the drawing-room stinks so abominably of
punch and tobacco, that it would strike you down to come into it. If you knew
what I have suffered, you would think I had the constitution of a chairman
to go through it. We never sit down to table without a dozen or more of
boisterous two-legged creatures as rude as bears; and I have nothing to do
but to heap up their plates, and drink to each of their healths: what is
worse than all, one of the beasts got tipsy, and nothing would serve
him but he must kiss me, which I was obliged to submit to for fear of
losing his vote and interest. Would you think it, dear
<HI>Charlotte?</HI>—do not laugh at me—I stood godmother in
person to a huge lubberly boy at a country farmer's, and they almost
poisoned me with their hodgepodge they called caudle, made of sour ale and
brown sugar. All this and more I have been obliged to comply with, that the
country fellows might not say my lady is proud and above them.</P>
<P>BESIDES, there is not a woman creature within twenty miles of
the place that is fit company for my housekeeper, and yet I must be
intimate with them all. Lady <HI>B—</HI> indeed is very near us; but
though we are very well acquainted in town, we must not be seen to speak
to each other here, because her lord is in the opposition. Poor
<HI>Thomas</HI> got a sad drubbing at her house, when I innocently sent
him at my first coming into the country with a how d'ye to her lady∣ship.
The greatest female acquaintance I have here are Mrs. Mayoress, a taylor's
wife, and Mrs. Alderman <HI>Gascoyne</HI> who sells pins and needles on one
side of the shop, while her husband works at his pestle and mortar on
the other. These ordinary wretches are constant attendants on my tea-table;
I am obliged to take them and their brats out an airing in my coach every
evening; and am afterwards often doomed to sit down to whist and
swabbers, or one and thirty bone-ace <PB N="118" REF="123"/> for farthings.
Mrs. Mayoress is a very violent party woman; and she has two pug-dogs, one
of which she calls Sir <HI>John</HI> and the other Colonel, in compliment you
must know to my husband and his brother candidate.</P>
<P>WE had a ball the other day; and I opened it with Sir
<HI>Humphrey Chase,</HI> who danced in his boots, and hobbled along for all
the world like the dancing bears which I have seen in the streets at
<HI>London.</HI> A terrible mistake happened about precedence, which I fear
will lose Sir <HI>John</HI> a good many votes: an attorney's wife was very
angry that her daughter, who is a little pert chit just come from the
board∣ing-school, was not called out to dance before Miss <HI>Norton</HI>
the brewer's daughter, when every body knew, she said, that her girl was a
gentlewoman bred and born.</P>
<P>I wish, my dear, you were to see my dressing-room; you
would think it was a ribband-shop. <HI>Lettice</HI> and I have been busy
all this week in making up knots and favours, and yesterday no milliner's
prentice could work harder than I did in tying them on to the sweaty hats of
country bumpkins. And is not it very hard upon me? I must not even dress as
I please; but am obliged to wear blue, though you know it does not suit my
complexion, and makes me look as horrid as the witches in <HI>Macbeth.</HI></P>
<P>BUT what is worse than all, Sir <HI>John</HI> tells me the
election expences have run so high that he must shorten my allowance of
pin-money. He talks of turning off half his servants; nay, he has even hinted
to me that I shall not come to town all the winter. Barbarous creature! but
if he dares serve me so, he shall positively lose his election next
time; I will raise such a spirit of opposition in all the wives and
daughters in the county against him.</P>
<P><PB N="119" REF="124"/>YOU see, my dear, what a miserable
life I have led ever since I have been banished into this odious country. I
wish I had married an earl or a duke, and then I should not have been
plagued with this fuss about elections. I dont know why Sir <HI>John</HI>
should be so desirous to be chosen; for I dont find a parliament man's
lady a bit more respected among the polite world. You will excuse my
employing <HI>Lettice</HI> to write this, while I dictated: as the girl was a
parson's daugh∣ter, she has a good education, and can spell tolerably
well: and really my eyes are so bad, (from not being able to sleep at
nights on account of my going to bed so horrid soon,) that that I can
hardly see to subscribe myself</P>

</LETTER>
<P>THIS lady's case, as related above, is indeed a very
distressful one; but as Sir <HI>John</HI> has had the good luck to gain his
point after a strong opposition, he will doubtless be sensible of the
great share his lady had in his success. For my own part, when I
consider the vast influence which the fair sex must naturally have over
my fellow countrymen, I cannot help looking on their interesting themselves
in these matters as a very serious affair. What success must a fine
lady meet with on her canvass! No gentleman to be sure could be so rude
or so cruel as to refuse such a pretty beggar any thing she could
ask; and an honest country farmer, who could withstand any other
arguments, might be coaxed and wheedled, or bribed with a smile, into voting
against his conscience. Many instances have been found during the late
election, of husbands who have been forced to poll as their wives would have
them; and I know a young fellow that was brought over to give a vote against
his inclination <PB N="120" REF="125"/> by his sweetheart, who refused to
receive his addresses if he did not change his party.</P>
<P>IT may not perhaps be too bold an assertion, that half the
members in the present parliament owe their seats to the direct or indirect
influence of the other sex: It would there∣fore be highly proper for the
legislature to provide against this evil for the future, and I hope
shortly to see among the Votes the following Resolution.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>QUASSOUW, the son of KQVUSSOMO, was <HI>Konquer</HI> or
Chief Captain over the Sixteen Nations of <HI>Caffraria.</HI> He was
descended from <HI>N'oh</HI> and <HI>Hingn'oh,</HI> who dropt from the Moon;
and his power extended over all the <HI>Kraals</HI> of the
<HI>Hottentots.</HI></P>
<P>THIS Prince was remarkable for his prowess and activity: his
speed was like the torrent that rushes down the preci∣pice, and he would
overtake the Wild Ass in her flight: his Arrows brought down the Eagle from
the clouds, the Lion fell before him, and his Launce drank the blood of the
Rhinoceros. He fathomed the waters of the deep, and buffeted the billows in the
tempest: he drew the Rock-Pish from their lurking-holes, and rifled the
beds of Coral. <PB N="122" REF="127"/> Trained from his infancy in the
exercise of war, to wield the Hassagaye with dexterity, and break the
Wild Bulls to battle, he was a stranger to the soft dalliance of love; and
beheld with indifference the thicklipped damsels of <HI>Gongeman,</HI> and
the flatnosed beauties of <HI>Hauteniqua.</HI></P>
<P>AS TQUASSOUW was one day giving instructions for spread∣ing
toils for the Elk, and digging pitfalls for the Elephant, he received
information, that a Tyger prowling for prey was committing ravages on the
<HI>Kraals</HI> of the <HI>Chamtouers.</HI> He snatched up his Bow of
Olive-wood, and bounded, like the Roe-Buck on the mountains, to their
assistance. He ar∣rived just at the instant, when the enraged animal
was about to fasten on a Virgin, and aiming a poisoned arrow at his heart
laid him dead at her feet. The Virgin threw herself on the ground, and
covered her head with dust, to thank her deliverer; but when she rose,
the Prince was dazzled with her charms. He was struck with the glossy hue
of her com∣plexion, which shone like the jetty down of the Black Hog of
<HI>Hessaqua</HI>: he was ravished with the prest gristle of her
nose; and his eyes dwelt with admiration on the flaccid beauties of her
breasts, which descended to her navel.</P>
<P>KNONMQUAIHA, (for that was the Virgin's name,) was daughter to
the <HI>Kouqucqua</HI> or Leader of the <HI>Kraal</HI>; who bred her up with
all the delicacy of her sex. She was fed with the entrails of Goats, she
sucked the eggs of the Ostrich, and her drink was the milk of Ewes. After
gazing for some time upon her charms, the Prince in great transport
embraced the soles of her feet: then ripping up the beast he had just
killed, took out the Caul, and hung it about her neck, in token of his
affection. He afterwards stripped the Tyger of his skin, and sending it
to the <HI>Kouqucqua</HI> her father demanded the damsel in marriage.</P>
<P>THE eve of the full moon was appointed for the celebra∣tion of
the nuptials of TQUASSOUW and KNONMQUAIHA. When the day arrived, the
magnificence in which the Bridegroom was arrayed amazed all <HI>Caffraria.</HI>
Over his <PB N="123" REF="128"/> shoulders was cast a <HI>Krosse</HI> or
Mantle of Wild Cat-skins: he cut Sandals for his feet from the raw hide of an
Elephant; he hunted down a Leopard, and of the spotted fur formed a superb
Cap for his head; he girded his loins with the Intestines, and the Bladder of
the beast he blew up and fastened to his hair.</P>
<P>NOR was KNONMQUAIHA less employed in adorning her person.
She made a varnish of the fat of Goats mixed with soot, with which she
anointed her whole body as she stood beneath the rays of the sun: her
locks were clotted with melted grease, and powdered with the yellow dust of
<HI>Buchu:</HI> her face, which shone like the polished Ebony, was
beauti∣fully varied with spots of Red Earth, and appeared like the sable
curtain of the night bespangled with stars: she sprinkled her limbs
with wood-ashes, and perfumed them with, the dung of the
<HI>Stinkbingsem.</HI> Her arms and legs were entwined with the shining
entrails of a Heifer: from her neck there hung a pouch composed of the
stomach of a Kid: the wings of an Ostrich overshadowed the fleshy
promontories behind; and before she wore an apron formed of the shaggy ears
of a Lion.</P>
<P>THE Chiefs of the several <HI>Kraals,</HI> who were summoned
to assist at their nuptials, formed a circle on the ground, sitting
upon their heels, and bowed their heads between their knees in token of
reverence. In the centre the illustrious Prince with his sable Bride
reposed upon soft cushions of Cow-dung. Then the <HI>Surri</HI> or Chief
Priest approached them, and in a deep voice chaunted the nuptial rites to the
melodious grumbling of the <HI>Gom-Gom</HI>; and at the same time (according
to the manner of <HI>Caffraria</HI>) bedewed them plentifully with the urinary
benediction. The Bride and Bridegroom rubbed in the precious stream with
extasy; while the briny drops trickled from their bodies, like the oozy
surge from the Rocks of <HI>Chirigriqua.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>Hottentots</HI> had seen the increase and wane of
two moons since the happy union of TQUASSOUW and KNONM∣QUAIHA, 
<PB N="124" REF="129"/> when the <HI>Kraals</HI> were surprised with the
appear∣ance of a most extraordinary personage, that came from the savage
people who rose from the sea, and had lately fixed themselves on the
borders of <HI>Caffraria.</HI> His body was en∣wrapped with strange
coverings, which concealed every part from sight except his face and hands.
Upon his skin the sun darted his scorching rays in vain, and the colour
of it was pale and wan as the watry beams of the moon. His hair, which he could
put on and take off at pleasure, was white as the blossoms of the Almond
Tree, and bushy as the fleece of the Ram. His lips and cheeks resembled the
Red Oker, and his nose was sharpened like the beak of an Eagle. His
language, which was rough and inarticulate, was as the language of beasts;
nor could TQUASSOUW dis∣cover his meaning, till a <HI>Hottentot</HI> (who at
the first coming of these people had been taken prisoner, and had
afterwards made his escape) interpreted between them. This interpre∣ter
informed the Prince, that the stranger was sent from his fellow countrymen
to treat about the enlargement of their territories, and that he was called
among them MYNHEER VAN SNICKERSNEE.</P>
<P>TQUASSOUW, who was remarkable for his humanity, treated the
savage with extraordinary benevolence. He spread a mantle of Sheep-skins
anointed with fat for his bed, and for his food he boiled in their own blood
the tripes of the fattest herds, that grazed in the rich pastures of the
<HI>Heykoms.</HI> The stranger in return instructed the Prince in the
manners of the savages, and often amused him with sending fire from a
hollow engine, which rent the air with thunder. Nor was he less studious to
please the gentle KNONMQUAIHA. He bound bracelets of polished metal about
her arms, and encircled her neck with beads of glass: he filled the
Cocoa-shell with a delicious liquor, and gave it her to drink, which
exhilarated her heart, and made her eyes sparkle with joy: he also taught
her to kindle fire through a tube of clay with the dried leaves of
<HI>Dacha,</HI> and to send forth rolls of odorous smoke from her mouth.
After having <PB N="125" REF="130"/> sojourned in the <HI>Kraals</HI> for the
space of half a moon, the stranger was dismissed with magnificent
presents of the teeth of Elephants; and a grant was made to his countrymen of
the fertile meadows of <HI>Kochoqua,</HI> and the forests of
<HI>Stink∣wood</HI> bounded by the <HI>Palamite</HI> River.</P>
<P>TQUASSOUW and KNONMQUAIHA continued to live to∣gether in the
most cordial affection; and the <HI>Surris</HI> every night invoked the great
<HI>Gounja Ticquoa,</HI> who illuminates the Moon, that he would give an heir
to the race of <HI>N'oh</HI> and <HI>Hingn'oh.</HI> The Princess at length
manifested the happy tokens of pregnancy; her waist encreased daily in
circum∣ference, and swelled like the Gourd. When the time of her delivery
approached, she was committed to the care of the Wise Women, who placed her
on a couch of the reeking entrails of a Cow newly slain, and to facilitate
the birth gave her a potion of the milk of Wild Asses, and fomented her
loins with the warm dung of Elephants. When the throes of child-birth came on,
a terrible hurricane howled along the coast, the air bellowed with thunder,
and the face of the Moon was obscured as with a veil. The <HI>Kraal</HI>
echoed with shrieks and lamentations, and the Wise Women cried out, that
the Princess was delivered of a MONSTER.</P>
<P>THE product of her womb was WHITE.—They took the child,
and washed him with the juice of Aloes:—they exposed his limbs to the
sun, anointed them with the fat, and rubbed them with the excrement of Black
Bulls:—but his skin still retained it's detested hue, and the child
was still WHITE. The venerable <HI>Surris</HI> were assembled to
deliberate on the cause of this prodigy; and they unanimously pro∣nounced,
that it was owing to the evil machinations of the Daemon <HI>Cham-ouna,</HI>
who had practised on the virtue of the Princess under the appearance of
MYNHEER VAN SNICKERSNEE.</P>
<P>THE incestuous parent with her unnatural offspring were judged
unworthy to live. They bowed a branch of an Olive Tree in the Forest of
Lions, on which the white monster was suspended by the heels; and
ravenous beasts feasted on <PB N="126" REF="131"/> the issue of
KNONMQUAIHA. The Princess herself was sentenced to the severe
punishment allotted to the heinous crime of Adultery. The
<HI>Kouquequas,</HI> who scarce twelve moons before had met to celebrate her
nuptials, were now summoned to assist at her unhappy death. They were
collected in a circle, each of them wielding a huge club of Cripplewood. The
beauteous criminal stood weeping in the midst of them, prepared to receive
the first blow from the hand of her injured Husband. TQUASSOUW in vain
assayed to perform the sad office: thrice he uplifted his ponderous mace
of iron, and thrice dropt it ineffectual on the ground. At length from his
reluctant arm descended the fell stroke, which lighted on that nose,
whose flatness and expansion at first captivated his heart. The
<HI>Kouquequas</HI> then rushing in, with their clubs redoubled their blows
on her body, 'till the pounded KNONMQUAIHA lay as an heap of mud, which the
retiring flood leaves on the strand.</P>
<P>HER battered limbs, now without form and distinction, were
enclosed in the paunch of a Rhinoceros, which was fastened to the point of
a bearded arrow, and shot into the Ocean. TQUASSOUW remained inconsolable
for her loss: he frequently climbed the lofty Cliffs of <HI>Chirigriqua,</HI>
and cast his eyes on the watry expanse. One night, as he stood howling
with the Wolves to the Moon, he descried the paunch that contained the
precious relicks of KNONMQUAIHA, dancing on a wave, and floating towards him.
Thrice he cried out with a lamentable voice, <HI>Bo, Bo, Bo:</HI> then
spring∣ing from the cliff, he darted like the Eagle sousing on his prey.
The paunch burst in sunder beneath his weight; the green wave was
discoloured with the gore; and TQUAS∣SOUW was inveloped in the mass. He was
heard of no more; and it was believed, that he was snatched up into the
Moon.</P>
<P>THEIR unhappy fate is recorded among the Nations of the
<HI>Hottentots</HI> to this day; and their Marriage-rites have ever since
concluded with a wish, 
<Q REND="inline">"That the Husband may be happier than
TQUASSOUW, and the Wife more chaste than KNONMQUAIHA."</Q></P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> REMEMBER, in a match between two per∣sons of different
religions, it was stipulated in the marriage articles, that the boys should
be bred up in the persuation of the father, and the girls in that of the
mother. The consequence of this was, that one part of the family was taught
to look upon the other with a most pious comtempt; and in the end it produced
a separasion. The sons followed the example of their father, and in order
to avoid the least appearance of superstition and bigotry, turned out
free∣thinkers: the lady of the house retired with her daughters

according to their sex: whence it often happens, that families are as much
distinguished by their peculiar manners, as by a certain cast of features
or com∣plexion. My young 'squire is put upon a little horse before he can
well walk, and becomes (as his father was before him) the pupil and companion
of the groom and the game∣keeper: And if miss's mamma should chance to be
the daughter of a poor man of quality, and the wife of a sub∣stantial
tradesman, the little lady is early instructed to va∣lue herself on her
blood, and to despise her father's dirty connections with business.</P>
<P>TO this method of education it is owing, that the same vices
and follies are delivered down from one generation to another. The modish
excesses of these times are in their nature the same with those which
were formerly in vogue, though they differ somewhat in their shape and
appearance. The present race of bucks, bloods, and freethinkers, are but the
spawn of the <HI>Mohocks</HI> and the <HI>Hell-Fire Club:</HI> and if our
modern fine ladies have had their Masquerades, their <HI>Vauxhalls,</HI>
their Sunday Tea Drinkings at <HI>Ranelagh,</HI> and their Morning Chocolate in
the <HI>Hay-Market,</HI> they have only improved upon the <HI>Ring,</HI> the
<HI>Spring-Gardens,</HI> the <HI>New-Exchange</HI> Assignations, and the
Morning Puppet-shew, which employed the attention of their grandmothers: and
as it is not apparent that our people of fashion are more wicked, so
neither are they wiser than their predecessors.</P>
<P><PB N="129" REF="134"/>WHEN I contemplate the manner in which
the younger part of the polite world is brought up, I am apt to carry my
reflections farther than what merely concerns their own persons. Let our
young men of fashion expose their igno∣rance abroad, rather than improve at
our Universities at home;—let them trifle away their Time in insipid
amuse∣ments, and run loose about the town in one continued round of
extravagance and debauchery;—let our young ladies be taught nothing but
gallantry and whist, and be seen only at routes and assemblies, if the
consequence extend not beyond themselves. But as these are to be the
fathers and mothers, the guardians and tutors, on whom the morals of our next
race must depend; it becomes a public concern, lest the reign of vice and
ignorance should be supported, as it were, by hereditary succession,
and pro∣pagated to distant generations.</P>
<P>THE modern method of education is indeed so little
cal∣culated to promote virtue and learning, that it is almost impossible
the children should be wiser or better than their parents. The country
'squire seldom fails of seeing his son as dull and aukward a looby as
himself; while the debauch∣ed or foppish man of quality breeds up a rake or
an empty coxcomb, who brings new diseases into the family, and fresh
mortgages on the estate. If you would therefore favour us, Mr. TOWN, with a
few remarks on this subject, you would do service to posterity: for the
present, give me leave to illustrate what I have said by the example of a
very fashionable family.</P>
<P>LADY BELLE MODELY was one of the finest women in the last
reign, as the Colonel her husband was one of the smartest fellows. After
they had astonished the world sin∣gly with the <HI>eclat</HI> of their
actions, they came together: her <PB N="130" REF="135"/> ladyship was proud of
fixing a man who was thought to have intrigued with half the women of
fashion; while the Colonel fell a sacrifice to her beauty, only because
she was admired by every body else. They lived together for some time in
great splendor; but as matrimony was a constraint upon their freedom, they
at length parted by a private agreement. Lady BELLE keeps the best company,
is at the head of every party of pleasure, never misses a masque∣rade,
and has card-tables constantly at her own house on Sundays. The Colonel is
one of the oldest members of the Club at <HI>White</HI>'s, runs horses at
<HI>Newmarket,</HI> has an act∣ress in keeping, and is protected from the
impertinence of duns, by having purchased a seat in parliament at almost
as great an expence as would have satisfied the demands of his creditors.</P>
<P>THEY have two children: the one has been educated by the
direction of his father, the other has been bred up under the eye of her mamma.
The boy was indeed put to a grammar-school for a while; but <HI>Latin</HI>
and <HI>Greek</HI> or indeed any language except <HI>French,</HI> are of no
service to a gentleman: and as the lad had discovered early marks of
spirit, (such as kicking down wheel-barrows and setting old women on
their heads,) the Colonel swore <HI>Jack</HI> should be a soldier, and
accordingly begged a pair of colours for him, be∣fore he was fifteen. The
Colonel who had served only in the peaceful campaigns of <HI>Covent
Garden,</HI> took great pains to instil into <HI>Jack</HI> all that prowess
so remarkable in the modern heroes of the army. He enumerated his victories
over bullies, his encounters with sharpers, his midnight skirmishes with
constables, his storming of bagnio's, his imprisonment in round-houses,
and his honourable wounds in the service of prostitutes. The Captain could
not fail of improving under so excellent a tutor, and soon became as 
<PB N="131" REF="136"/> eminent as his father. He is a Blood of the first
rate; <HI>Sherlock</HI> has instructed him in the use of the broad sword,
and <HI>Broughton</HI> has taught him to box. He is a fine Gentle∣man at
assemblies, a sharper at the gaming-table, and a bully at the bagnios. He
has not yet killed his man in the <HI>honourable</HI> way; but he has gallantly
crippled several watch∣men, and most couragiously run a drawer through
the body. His scanty pay will not allow him to keep a mistress; but it is
said that he is privately married to a woman of the town.</P>
<P>SUCH is the consequence of the son's education; and by
this our people of distinction may learn, how much better it is to let a lad
see the world (as the phrase is) than to lash him through a
grammar-school like a parish-boy, and con∣fine him with dull pedants in a
college cloister. Lady BELLE has not been less careful of her daughter
Miss HARRIOT. Those who undertake the business of educating polite
females have laid it down as a rule to consider women merely as Dolls; and
therefore never attempt the cultivation of their principles, but employ their
whole attention on adorning their persons. The romantic notions of honour and
virtue are only fit for poor aukward creatures, who are to marry a shopkeeper
or a parson, but they can be of no use to a fine girl who is design'd to
make a figure. Accordingly Miss HARRIOT was com∣mitted to the care of
<HI>Madame Governante</HI> who never suffered her to speak a word of
<HI>English,</HI> and a <HI>French</HI> dancing-master who taught her to
hold up her head, and come into the room like a little lady. As she grew up,
her mamma in∣structed her in the nicest points of ceremony and good
breed∣ing: she explained to her the laws and regulations of dress; directed
her in the choice of her brocades, told her what fashions best became her,
and what colours best suited her complexion. These excellent rules were
constantly enforced <PB N="132" REF="137"/> by examples drawn from her
ladyship's own practice: above all, she unravelled the various arts of
gallantry and intrigue; recounted the stratagems she had herself employed
in gain∣ing new conquests, taught her when to advance and when to retreat,
and how far she might venture to indulge herself in certain freedoms
without endangering her reputation.</P>
<P>MISS HARRIOT soon became the public admiration of all the
pretty fellows, and was allowed to be a lady of the most elegant
accomplishments. She was reckoned to play a better game at Whist than Mrs.
<HI>Sharply,</HI> and bets with more spirit at Brag than the bold Lady
<HI>Atall.</HI> She was carried about to <HI>Tunbridge, Bath, Cheltenham,</HI>
and every other place of diversion by the mother; where she was exposed
as at a public mart for beauty, and put up to the best bidder. But as Miss
had some fortune in her own disposal, she had not the patience to wait
the formal delays of marriage articles, jointures, settlements, and
pin-money; and (just before the late Act took place) eloped with a gentleman,
who had long been very intimate with her mamma, and recommended himself to
MISS HARRIOT by a stature of six foot and a shoulder-knot.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>— 
<DATE><HI>June</HI> 28, 1754.</DATE></DATELINE> 
<SALUTE>DEAR COUSIN!</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHEREVER the Town goes, those who live by the Town naturally
follow: the facetious and enter∣taining gentry, who during the winter amused
the world within the bills of mortality, are now dispersed into differ∣ent
parts of the country. We have had most of them here already. The
<HI>Colossus,</HI> the <HI>Dwarf,</HI> the <HI>Female Sam∣son,</HI> made
some stay with us. We went for a week toge∣ther to see Mr.
<HI>Powell</HI> eat red hot tobacco pipes, and swallow fire and brimstone:
the <HI>Hermaphrodite</HI> was obliged to leave the town on a scandalous
report, that a lady used fre∣quently to visit him in private. Mr.
<HI>Church</HI> for some time charmed us with concertos and sonatas on the
Jew's-Harp; and at our last ball we footed it to our usual melody of the
Tabor and Pipe, accompanied with the Cymbal and Wooden Spoons.</P>
<P>I WILL not tire you with a particular detail of all our
Entertainments, but confine myself at present to those of the Stage.
About the middle of last month, there came <PB N="135" REF="140"/> among us
one of those gentlemen, who are famous for the cure of every distemper, and
especially those pronounced incurable by the Faculty. The vulgar call him a
<HI>Mounte∣bank</HI>;—and when I considered his impassioned
speeches, and the extempore stage from which he uttered them, I was apt to
compare them to <HI>Thespis</HI> and his Cart. Again, when I beheld the
Doctor dealing out his drugs, and at the same time saw his <HI>Merry
Andrew</HI> play over his tricks it put me in mind of a Tragi-Comedy, where the
pathetic and the ludicrous are so intimately connected, and the whole piece
is so merry and so sad, that the audience is at a loss whether they
shall laugh or cry.</P>
<P>AFTER the Doctor had been here some time, there came down
two or three emissaries from a Strolling Company, in order (according to
the Player's phrase) to <HI>take the Town</HI>; but the Mayor being a
strict Presbyterian, absolutely refu∣sed to licence their exhibitions.
The Players you must know finding this a good town, had taken a lease
last Sum∣mer of an old Synagogue deserted by the <HI>Jews,</HI> and were
therefore much alarmed at this disappointment: but when they were in the
utmost despair, the ladies of the place joined in a petition to Mrs.
Mayoress, who prevailed on her husband to wink at their performances. The
Company immediately opened their Synagogue-Theatre with the <HI>Merchant of
Venice</HI>; and finding the Doctor's <HI>Zany</HI> a droll fellow, they
decoyed him into their service; and he has since performed the part of the
<HI>Mock Doctor</HI> with universal applause. Upon his revolt the Doctor
himself found it absolutely necessary to enter of the Company, and
having a talent for Tragedy has performed with great success the Apothecary
in <HI>Romeo and Juliet.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="136" REF="141"/>THE Performers at our Rustic Theatre
are far beyond those paltry Strollers, who run about the country, and exhibit
in a barn or a cowhouse: for (as their bills declare) they are a Company of
Comedians from the Theatres Royal; and I assure you, they are as much
applauded by our country critics, as any of your capital actors. The shops of
our tradesmen have been almost deserted, and a croud of weavers and
hardware-men have elbowed each other two hours before the opening of the doors,
when the bills have informed us in enormous red letters that the part of
<HI>George Barnwell</HI> was to be performed by Mr. —, at the parti∣cular
desire of several ladies of distinction. It is true in∣deed that our
principal actors have most of them had their education in <HI>Covent
Garden</HI> or <HI>Drury Lane</HI>; but they have been employed in the
business of the Drama in a degree but just above a Scene-shifter. An
heroine, to whom your managers in town (in envy to her rising merit) scarce
allotted the humble part of a Confidante, now blubbers out <HI>Andromache</HI>
or <HI>Belvidera:</HI> the attendants on a monarch now strut monarchs
themselves, mutes find their voices, and message-bearers rise into
heroes. The humour of our best Commedian consists in shrugs and
grimaces; he jokes in a wry mouth, and repartees in a grin: in short he
practises on <HI>Congreve</HI> and <HI>Vanbrugh</HI> all those
distortions, which gained him so much applause from the galleries in the
drubs which he was condemned to undergo in Pantomimes. I was vastly diverted
at seeing a fellow in the character of Sir <HI>Harry Wildair,</HI> whose
chief action was a continual pressing together of the thumb and
fore-finger, which, had he lifted them to his nose, I should have thought
he designed as an imitation of taking snuff: but I could easily account
for the cause of this singular gesture, when I discovered 
<PB N="137" REF="142"/> that Sir <HI>Harry</HI> was no less a person than
the dextrous Mr. <HI>Clippit</HI> the Candle-snuffer.</P>
<P>YOU would laugh to see how strangely the parts of a play
are cast. They played <HI>Cato</HI>; and their <HI>Marcia</HI> was such an
old woman, that when <HI>Juba</HI> came on with his— 
<Q REND="inline">"Hail! charming maid!"</Q>—the fellow
could not help laughing. Another night I was surprized to hear an eager lover
talk of rushing into his mistress's arms, rioting on the nectar of her
lips, and desiring (in the tragedy rapture) to hug her thus and thus for
ever; though he always took care to stand at a most ceremonious distance.
But I was afterwards very much diverted at the cause of this extra∣ordinary
respect, when I was told that the lady laboured under the misfortune of an
ulcer in her leg, which occa∣sioned such a disagreable stench that the
performers were obliged to keep her at arm's length. The entertainment was
<HI>Lethe:</HI> and the part of the <HI>Frenchman</HI> was performed by a
<HI>South-Briton,</HI> who, as he could not pronounce a word of the
<HI>French</HI> language, supplied its place by gabbling in his native
<HI>Welch.</HI></P>
<P>THE Decorations, or (in the Theatrical dialect) the
<HI>Pro∣perty</HI> of our Company is as extraordinary as the Performers.
<HI>Othello</HI> raves about a checked handkerchief, the Ghost in
<HI>Hamlet</HI> stalks in a postilion's leather jacket for a coat of mail,
and <HI>Cupid</HI> enters with a fiddle-case slung over his shoulders for
a quiver. The apothecary of the town is free of the house for lending them a
pestle and mortar to serve as the bell in <HI>Venice Preserved</HI>; and
a barber-surgeon has the same privilege for furnishing them basons of
blood to besmear the daggers in <HI>Macheth. Macheth</HI> himself carries a
rolling-pin in his hand for a truncheon, and as the <PB N="138" REF="143"/>
breaking of glasses would be very expensive, he dashes down a pewter
pint pot at the sight of <HI>Banquo</HI>'s ghost.</P>
<P>A FRAY happened here the other night, which was no small
diversion to the company. It seems there had been a great contest between
two of these mimic heroes, which was the fittest to play <HI>Richard the
Third.</HI> One of them was reckoned to have the better person, as he was
very round shoulder'd, and one of his legs was shorter than the other; but
his antagonist carried the part, because he started best in the
Tent-Scene. However, when the curtain drew up, they both rushed in upon the
scene at once, and bawling out together 
<Q REND="inline">"Now are our brows bound with victo∣rious
wreaths,"</Q> they both went through the whole speech without stopping.</P>

the more modern and fashionable sciences. A Treatise on Whist has more
ad∣mirers than a System of Logic, and a New Atalantis would be more
universally read than a Practice of Piety. A fine gentleman or lady would no
more chuse the mind of a pedant, than the person of a cook-maid or a
porter. I can∣not therefore but approve of the plan laid down by the writer of
the following letter, and would recommend it to all persons of fashion to
subscribe to his proposals.</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>To Mr. TOWN.</HEAD>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE long observed with infinite regret the little care
that is taken to supply persons of distinction with pro∣per books for
their instruction and amusement. It is no wonder that they should be so
averse to study, when learn∣ing is rendered so disagreeable. Common
creatures indeed, as soon as they can spell, may be made to read a dull
chap∣ter in the Testament; after which the Whole Duty of Man, or some other
useless good book, may be put into their hands: <PB N="141" REF="146"/> but
these can never instruct a man of the world to say fine things to a lady,
or to swear with a good grace. Among a few dirty pedants the knowledge of
<HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Latin</HI> may be cultivated; but among fine gentlemen
these are justly discarded for <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Italian.</HI> Why
should persons of quality trouble themselves about Mathematics and
Philo∣sophy, or throw away their time in scratching circles and triangles
on a slate, and then rubbing them out again? All the Algebra requisite for
them to know, is the combi∣nation of figures on the dice; nor could
<HI>Euclid</HI> be of any use to them, except he had represented the most
graceful attitudes in fencing, or drawn out the lines of a minuet.</P>
<P>IN order to remedy these inconveniences, and that the
erudition of persons of fashion may be as different from the vulgar
knowledge of the rest of mankind as their dress, I have formed a project
for regulating their studies. An old crabbed Philosopher once told a
monarch, that there was no Royal way of learning the Mathematics:—First
then, as to the musty volumes which contain <HI>Greek, Latin,</HI> and the
Sciences, (since there is no genteel method of coming at the knowledge of
them,) I would banish them intirely from the polite world, and have them
chained down in university libraries, the only places where they can be
useful or enter∣taining. Having thus cleared the shelves of this learned
lumber, we shall have room to fill them more elegantly. To this end I have
collected all such books as are proper to be perused by people of quality,
and shall shortly make my Scheme public by opening a handsome room under
the title of the <HI>Polite Circulating Library.</HI> Many of my books are
entirely new and original: all the modern novels, and most of the periodical
papers fall so directly in with my plan, that they will be sure to find a
place in my library; and <PB N="142" REF="147"/> if Mr. TOWN shews himself
an encourager of my scheme, I shall expect to see peers and peeresses
take up the pen, and shine in the CONNOISSEUR.</P>
<P>I INTEND in the beginning of the winter to publish my
proposals at large, and in the mean time beg you to submit the following
specimen of my books to the public.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG> LITTLE <HI>Frenchman,</HI> commonly known in town by the name
of <HI>Count,</HI> and whose figure has been long stuck up in the win∣dows
of printshops, was always remarkable for the meanness and at the same
time the foppery of his appearance. His shoes, though perhaps capped at the
toe, had red heels to them; and his stock∣ings, though often full of holes,
were constantly rolled up over his knees. By good luck he was once master
of half a guinea; and having a great longing for a feather to his hat, and a
very pressing necessity for a pair of breeches, he de∣bated with
himself about the disposal of his money. How∣ever his vanity got the
better of his necessity; and the next <PB N="146" REF="151"/> time the
<HI>Count</HI> appeared in the Mall, by the ornaments of his head you would

desiring to appear finer than they can afford, are owing the many rusty
suits of black, the tyes that seem taken from the basket of a shoeboy,
and the smart waistcoats edged with a narrow cord, which serves as an
apology for lace. I know a man of this cast who has but one coat; but by now
and then turning the cuffs, and chang∣ing the cape, it passes for two. He
uses the same artifice with his peruke, which is naturally a kind of
flowing Bob; but by the occasional addition of two tails to it, it
sometimes appears as a Major. Of this sort of men are composed the
numerous fraternity of the shabby-genteel, who are the chief support of the
clothiers in <HI>Monmouth-street,</HI> and the barbers in <HI>Middle
Row.</HI></P>
<P>WOMEN are naturally so fond of ornament, that it is no wonder
we should meet with so many second-hand gentry in that sex. Hence
arise the red-armed Belles that appear in the Park every Sunday; hence it is
that Sacks and Peten∣lairs may be seen at <HI>Moor-Fields</HI> and
<HI>Whitechapel</HI>; and that those, who are ambitious to shine in
diamonds, glitter in paste and Scotch pebbles. When I see the wives and
daugh∣ters of tradesmen and mechanics make such attempts at finery, I
cannot help pitying their poor fathers and husbands, and at the same time
am apt to consider their dress as a robbery on the shop. Thus when I
observe the tawdry gentility of a tallow-chandler's daughter, I look upon her
as hung round with long sixes, short eights, and rush-lights; and If I
con∣template <PB N="147" REF="152"/> the aukward pride of dress in a butcher's
wife, I suppose her carrying about her sirloins of beef, fillets of veal,
and shoulders of mutton. I was vastly diverted with a dis∣covery I made a
few days since. Going upon same business to a tradesman's house, I
surprized in a very extraordinary dishabille two females, whom I had been
frequently used to see strangely dizened out in the Mall. These fine
Ladies, it seems, were no other than my honest friend's daughters; and one,
who always dresses the family-dinner, was gen∣teelly employed in winding up
the jack, while the other was up to the elbows in soap-suds.</P>
<P>A DESIRE of grandeur and magnificence is often absurd in
those who can support it; but when it takes hold of those who can
scarce furnish themselves with necessaries, their poverty, instead
of demanding our pity, becomes an object of ridicule. Many families among
those who are called middling people, are not content without living
elegantly as well as comfortably, and often involve themselves in very
comical distresses. When they aim at appearing grand in the eye of the
world, they grow proportionably mean and sordid in private. I went the other
day to dine with an old friend; and as he used to keep a remarkable good
table, I was surprized that I could scarce make a meal with him. After
dinner he rung the bell, and ordered the chariot to be got ready at six; and
then turning to me with an air of supe∣riority, asked if he should set
me down. Here the riddle was out; and I found that his equipage had eat up his
table, and that he was obliged to starve his family to feed his horses.</P>
<P>I AM acquainted with another family, where the master keeps an
account against himself. This account is exactly stated in a large
ledger-book. What he saves from his ordi∣nary expences he places under the
title of DEBTOR, and what <PB N="148" REF="153"/> he runs out is ranged under
CREDITOR. I had lately an op∣portunity of turning over this curious account,
and could not help smiling at many of the articles. Among the rest I
re∣member the following, with which I shall present the reader.</P>

<P><PB N="149" REF="154"/>TRUE oeconomy does not merely consist
in not exceeding our income, but in such a judicious management of it as
renders our whole appearance equal and consistent. We should laugh at a
nobleman, who to support the expence of running horses should abridge his
set to a pair, and that his jockey's might come in first for the plate be
content to have his family dragged to his country-seat, like servant-maids
in the Caravan. There are many well-meaning peo∣ple, who have the pride of
living in a polite quarter of the town, though they are distressed to pay
the taxes: and what is more common than to see one particular room in an
house furnished like a palace, while the rest have scarce the
neces∣sary accommodations of an inn? such a conduct appears to me equally
ridiculous with that of the <HI>Frenchman,</HI> who (ac∣cording to the jest)
for the sake of wearing ruffles is con∣tented to go without a shirt.</P>
<P>THIS endeavour to appear grander than our circumstances will
allow, is no where so contemptible as among those men of pleasure about
town, who have not fortunes in any pro∣portion to their spirit. Men of
quality have wisely contrived that their sins should be expensive: for
which reason those, who with equal taste have less money, are obliged
to be oeconomists in their sins, and are put to many little shifts to
appear tolerably profligate and debauched. They get a knowledge of the names
and faces of the most noted women upon town, and pretend an intimate
acquaintance with them, though they know none of that order of ladies above the
draggle-tailed prostitutes who walk the <HI>Strand.</HI> They talk very
familiarly of the <HI>King's Arms,</HI> and are in raptures with Mrs.
<HI>Allen</HI>'s Claret; though they always dine snugly at a Chop-house,
and spend their evening at an Ale-house or Cyder-cellar. The most
ridiculous character I know of <PB N="150" REF="155"/> this sort is a young
fellow, the son of a rich tobacconist in the city, who (because it is the
fashion) has taken a girl into keeping. He knows the world better than to
set her up a chariot, or let her have money at her own disposal. He
regulates her expences with the nicest oeconomy, and em∣ploys every morning
in setting down what is laid out upon her. He very seriously takes an
account of Rolls and Butter, two-pence.—For Ribband, one shilling and
four pence.—Pins, a half-penny, <HI>&amp;c. &amp;c.</HI> Thus does he
reconcile his extravagance and frugality to each other, and is as penurious and
exact as an usurer, that he may be as genteel and as wicked as a lord.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG> GENTLEMAN of my acquaintance lately laid before me an
estimate of the consumption of bread and cheese, cakes, ale, &amp;c. in
all the little towns near <HI>London</HI> every Sunday. It is incredible how
many thousand buns are devoured in that one day at <HI>Chelsea</HI> and
<HI>Paddington</HI>; and how much beer is swallowed at <HI>Pancras</HI> and
<HI>Mile End.</HI> Upon the whole I was vastly entertained with a review of
this estimate, and could not help approving the observation of <HI>Tom
Brown,</HI> 
<Q REND="inline">"that the Sabbath is a very fine institution,
since the very breaking it is the support of half the vil∣lages about our
metropolis."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="152" REF="157"/>OUR common people are very observant of
that part of the commandment, which enjoins them to do no manner of work on
that day, which they also seem to understand as a licence to devote it to
pleasure. They take this opportunity of thrusting their heads into the
pillory at <HI>Georgia,</HI> being sworn at <HI>Highgate,</HI> and rolling
down <HI>Flamstead Hill</HI> in the Park at <HI>Greenwich.</HI> As they all
aim at going into the country, nothing can be a greater misfortune to the
meaner part of the inhabitants of <HI>London</HI> and <HI>Westminster</HI>
than a rainy Sunday; and how many honest people would be baulked of a ride
once a week, if the legislature was to limit the hired one-horse-chaises
working on that day to a certain number as well as the hackney coaches.</P>
<P>THE substantial tradesman is carried to his snug-box,
which has nothing rural about it except the ivy that over∣runs the front, and
is placed as near to the road side as pos∣sible, where the pleasure of
seeing carriages pass under his window amply compensates for his being
almost smothered with dust. The few smart 'prentices, who are able to
sit a horse, may be seen spurring their broken-winded hacks up the
hills; and the good-natured husband together with his mate is dragged along
the road to the envy and admi∣ration of the foot-passenger, who (to
compleat the Sun∣day picture) trudges patiently with a child in one arm, while
his beloved doxy leans on the other and waddles at his side sweltering
beneath the unusual weight of an hoop-petticoat.</P>
<P>IT is not to be supposed, that the country has in itself
any peculiar attractive charms to those who think them∣selves out of the
world, if they are not within the sound of <HI>Bow Bell.</HI> To most of
our Cockneys it serves only as an excuse for eating and drinking; and they
get out of town, <PB N="153" REF="158"/> merely because they have nothing to
do at home; a brick∣kiln smells as sweet to them as a farm-yard: they would
pass by a barn or a hay-stack without notice; but they re∣joice at the
sight of every hedge ale-house, that promises good home-brew'd. As the
rest of a cit's life is regular and uniform, his Sunday diversions have as
little variety; and if he was to take a journal of them, we might suppose
that it would run much in the following manner.</P>

and take out a writ against Colonel <HI>Promise.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></Q>
<P>AS to persons of quality, like Lady <HI>Loverule</HI> in the
farce, they can not see why one day should be more holy than ano∣ther:
therefore Sunday wears the same face with them as the rest of the week.
Accordingly, for some part of this summer <HI>Ranelagh</HI> was opened on
Sunday evenings; and I cannot help wondering that the custom did not
continue. It must have been very convenient to pass away the time there;
till the hour of meeting at the card-table; and it was certainly more decent to
fix assignations, there, than at church.</P>
<P>GOING to Church may indeed be reckoned among our Sunday
amusements, as it is made a mere matter of diver∣sion among many
well-meaning people, who are induced to appear in a place of worship from the
same motives that they frequent other public places. To some it answers
all the pur∣poses of a route or assembly,—to see and be seen by
their acquaintance; and from their bows, nods, curt'sies, and loud
conversations one might conclude that they imagined them∣selves in a
drawing-room. To others it affords the cheap op∣portunity of shewing their
taste for dress: not a few, I be∣lieve, are drawn together in our
cathedrals and larger churches by the influence of the music more than the
prayers, and are kept awake by a jig from the organ-loft, tho they lulled to
sleep by the harangue from the pulpit. A well disposed Christian will
go a mile from his own house to the Temple-Church, <PB N="155" REF="160"/>
Church, not because a <HI>Sherlock</HI> is to preach, but to hear a Solo from
<HI>Stanley.</HI></P>
<P>BUT though going to church may be deemed a kind of amusement,
yet upon modern principles it appears such a very odd one, that I am at at a
loss to account for the reasons which induced our ancestors to give into
that method of passing their Sunday. At least it is so wholly
incompatible with the polite system of life, that a person of fashion
(as affairs are now managed) finds it absolutely impossible to comply
with this practice. Then again the service always begins at such
unfashionable hours, that in the morning a man must huddle on his cloaths
like a boy to run to school, and in an afternoon must inevitably go without
his dinner. In order to remove all these objections, and that some Ritual
may be established in this kingdom agreeable to our inclina∣tions and
consistent with our practice, the following SCHEME has been lately sent
me in order to submit it to the serious consideration of the public.</P>
<Q> 
<LIST>
<ITEM><HI>Imprimis,</HI> IT is humbly proposed, that
Christianity be entirely abolished by Act of Parliament, and that no other
religion be imposed on us in it's stead; but as the age grows daily more
and more enlightened, we may at last be quite delivered from the influence of
superstition and bigotry.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Secondly,</HI> THAT in order to prevent our ever
relapsing into pious errors, that the common people may not lose their
holiday, every Sunday be set apart to commemorate our victory over all
religion; that the Churches be turned into Free-thinking Meeting-Houses, and
discourses read in them to confute the Doctrine of a future state, the
im∣mortality of the soul, and other absurd notions which some people now
regard as objects of belief.</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="156" REF="161"/><HI>Thirdly,</HI> THAT a Ritual be
compiled exactly opposite to our present Liturgy; and that instead of
reading portions of Scripture, the first and second lessons shall
consist of a Section of the Posthumous Works of Lord <HI>Bolinbroke,</HI>
or of a few pages from the writings of <HI>Spinoza, Chubb, Maundeville, Hobbes,
Collins, Tindal, &amp;c.</HI> from which writers the preach∣ers shall also
take their text.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Fourthly,</HI> THAT the usual Feasts and Fasts,
viz. Christ∣mas Day, Easter Sunday, Trinity Sunday, &amp;c. be still
preserved; but that on those days discourses be delivered suit∣able
to the occasion, containing a refutation of the Nativity, the Resurrection,
the Trinity, &amp;c.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Fifthly,</HI> THAT instead of the vile melody of a
Clerk bawling out two Staves of <HI>Sternhold</HI> and <HI>Hopkins,</HI> or a
Cathedral Choir singing Anthems from the Psalter, some of the most
fashionable Cantatas, Opera Airs, Songs, or Catches, be performed by the
best voices for the enter∣tainment of the company.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Lastly,</HI> THAT the whole Service be conducted
with such taste and elegance as may render these Free-thinking
Meeting-Houses as agreeable as the Theatres; and that they may be even more
judiciously calculated for the propagation of Atheism and Infidelity than
the <HI>Robin Hood</HI> Society or the Oratory in <HI>Clare Market.</HI></ITEM>

<DIV2 TYPE="body of issue">
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>T is a heavy tax upon authors that they should always be
expected to write sense. Some few indeed, who are rich in senti∣ment, pay
this tax very chearfully, but the generality endeavour one way or another to
elude it. For this purpose some have moulded their pieces into the form of
wings, axes, eggs, and altars; while others have laced down the side of a
copy of verses with the letters of their mistress's name, and called it
an acrostic: not to mention the curious inventions of rebusses and
anagrams. For the same reasons, the modern song-writers for our public
gardens, who are our principal love-poets at present, entertain us with
sonnets and madigrals in <PB N="158" REF="163"/> Crambo. Authors who promise
wit, pay us off with puns and quibbles; and with our writers of comedy, long
swords, short jerkins, and tables with carpets over them pass for
incident and humour.</P>
<P>BUT no artifice of this sort has been so often and so
suc∣cessfully practiced as the immoderate use of uncouth terms and
expressions. Words that mean nothing, provided they sound big, and fill
the ear, are the best succedanium for sense. Nothing so effectually
answers Mr. <HI>Bayes</HI>'s endea∣vour to <HI>elevate and surprize</HI>;
and the reader, tho' he sees nothing but straws float on the surface,
candidly supposes that there are pearls and diamonds at the bottom. Several
dull authors by availing themselves of this secret have passed for very
deep writers, and arrant Nonsense has as often laid snugly beneath hard
words, as a shallow pate beneath the solemn appearance of a full-bottomed
periwig.</P>
<P>THOSE who are employed in what they call abstract
spe∣culations most commonly have recourse to this method. Their
dissertations are naturally expected to illustrate and explain, but this
is sometimes a task above their abilities; and when they have led the
reader into a maze, from which they cannot deliver him, they very wisely
bewilder him the more. This is the case with those profound writers who
have treated concerning the essence of matter, who talk very gravely of
cuppeity, tableity, tallow-chandleity, and twenty other things with as much
sound and as little signification. Of these we may very well say with
the poet, 
<Q> 
<L>Such labour'd nothings in so strange a stile,</L> 
<L>Amaze th'unlearn'd, and make the learned smile.</L> 
<BIBL>POPE.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P><PB N="159" REF="164"/>NO mode of expression throws such an
impenetrable mist over a work as an unnecessary profusion of Technical
Terms. This will appear very plainly to those who will turn over a few pages
of a modern Collection of Voyages. Descriptions of a storm make some of
the finest and most striking passages in the best poets, and it is
for these in particular that <HI>Lon∣ginus</HI> admires the
<HI>Odyssey.</HI> The real circumstances of a storm are in themselves
without the aid of poetical ornaments very affecting, yet whoever reads an
account of them in any of our writers of Voyages, will be so puzzled and
perplexed with <HI>Starboard</HI> and <HI>Larboard,</HI> the
<HI>Main-mast</HI> and <HI>Mizen-mast,</HI> and a multitude of Sea-terms,
that he will not be the least moved at the distress of the ship's crew.
The absurdity of this did not escape <HI>Swift,</HI> who has ridiculed it
by a mock description of the same kind in his <HI>Gulliver.</HI> Those
who treat military subjects are equally ridiculous: they over∣whelm you with
<HI>Counterscarps, Palisades, Bastions,</HI> &amp;c. and so fortify
their no-meaning with hard words, that it is absolutely impossible to
beat them out of their intrenchments. Such writers, who abound in Technical
Terms, always put me in mind of <HI>Ignoramus</HI> in the play, who courts his
mistress out of the law-dictionary, runs over a long catalogue of the
messuages, lands, tenements, barns, outhouses, &amp;c. of which he will
put her in possession, if she will <HI>join issue</HI> with him,
and manifests his passion in the same manner that he would draw up a
lease.</P>
<P>THIS affectation is never more offensive than when it gets
into the Pulpit. The greater part of almost every audience that sits under
our preachers are ignorant and illiterate, and should therefore have every
thing delivered to them in as plain, simple, and intelligible a manner as
possible. Hard words, if they have any meaning, can only 
<PB N="160" REF="165"/> serve to make them stare, and they can never be
edified by what they do not understand. Young clergymen just come from the
University, are proud of shewing the world that they have been reading the
Fathers, and are fond of entering on the most abstruse points of
Divinity. But they would employ their time more to their own credit as well as
the improvement of their hearers, if they would rather endea∣vour to explain
and inforce the precepts of the Apostles and Evangelists, than retail the
confused hypotheses of crab∣bed metaphysicians.</P>
<P>AS to essays, and all other pieces that come under the
denomination of familiar writings, one would ima∣gine that they must
necessarily be written in the easy language of Nature and Common-Sense.
No writer can flatter himself that his productions will be an agree∣able part
of the equipage of the tea-table, who writes almost too abstrusely for
the study, and involves his thoughts in hard words and affected latinisms.
Yet this has been reckoned by many the standard stile for these loose
de∣tatched pieces. <HI>Addison</HI> was proud that he could boast of having
drawn learning out of schools and colleges into clubs and coffee-houses, as
<HI>Socrates</HI> was said to draw morality from the clouds to dwell among
men: but these people (as Lord <HI>Bolinbroke</HI> pretends to say of the
same <HI>Socrates</HI>) mount the Clouds themselves. This new-fangled
manner of delivering our sentiments is cal∣led writing sound sense: if
I find this mode seems likely to prevail, I shall certainly think it
expedient to give into it, and very suddenly oblige the world with a
CONNOISSEUR so <HI>sensible</HI> that it will be impossible to
understand it.</P>
<P><PB N="161" REF="166"/>BUT hard words and uncouth ways of
expressing ourselves never appear with so ill a grace as in our common
conversation: in writings we expect some degree of exactness and
precision, but if even there they seem harsh and disagreeable, when
they obstruct the freedom of our familiar chat, they either make us laugh or
put us out of patience. However some gentlemen, who would be accounted
fine-spoken persons, make use of them upon all occasions, and scarce
enquire how you do, or bid you good-morrow in any phrase that is
intelligible. It always puts me in pain to find a lady give into this practice:
if she makes no blunder, it sets very ungracefully upon her; but it is ten
to one that the rough uncouth syllables that form these words are too
harsh and big for the pretty creature's mouth, and then she maims them and
breaks them to her use so whimsically, that one can scarce tell whether
she is talking <HI>French</HI> or <HI>English.</HI>—I shall make no
more reflections on this subject at present, but conclude my paper with a
short story.</P>
<P>A MERRY fellow, who was formerly of the univer∣sity, going
through <HI>Cambridge</HI> on a journey, took it into his head to call on his
old tutor. As it is no great wonder that pedantry should be found in a
college, the tutor used to lard his conversation with numberless hard
words and forced derivations from the <HI>Latin.</HI> His pupil, who had a mind
to banter the old gentleman on his darling foible, when he visited him
entered his cham∣bers with his hat in one hand, and a dictionary in the other.
The first compliments were scarce over before the tutor bolted out a word
big enough for the mouth of <HI>Garagantua.</HI> Here the pupil begged that he
would stop a little, and after turning over his dictionary desired him 
<PB N="162" REF="167"/> to proceed. The learned gentleman went on, and the pupil
seem'd to listen with great attention, till another word came out as hard
as the former, at which he again interrupted him, and again had recourse to
his dictionary. This put the Old Don so much out of patience, that he rose
in a rage, and bid him get out of the room for an ig∣norant impudent
coxcomb.</P>

this:"</Q>—but it were to be wished, that the conscience of every
living reprobate could work on his imagination in the same manner, and
raise up such horrid apparitions to torment him. Where is the Wretch so
hardened, who would not be dismayed at these terrors? Or who could
persevere in a course of wickedness, when every fresh offence would
create a new fury to haunt him for his crimes?</P>
<P>LET us, for instance take a view of the most glaring
circumstances in the life of that arch-infidel TOM DARE-DEVIL: and let us at
the same time conceive (if possible) what pangs he must have felt, had
every flagitious act been <PB N="165" REF="170"/> attended with the same
phantoms that distracted him on his death-bed. First then, let us
contemplate him as a Parracide; for so he may be called, who by repeated
dis∣obedience broke the heart of a most affectionate father. Could filial
ingratitude receive a sharper punishment, than in the midst of his
debaucheries to have this father continually before his eyes, expostulating
with him on his unnatural behaviour? O my son, (might he hear him say) was
it for 
<Q REND="inline">"this that thy mother, who died in giving thee
life, begged me with her last breath to be kind to the boy? Was it for this,
that the country rung with joy for my being blessed with an heir?—O
my child, who can I now call my heir? That estate which I was so
sollicitous to improve for thy sake, is dissipated among jockeys,
gamblers, pimps, and prostitutes.—If you ever should have a son,
may His ingratitude never make you think of Me."</Q></P>
<P>TOM indeed took care never to have any vexation from children:
He had too great a spirit to bear the shackles of matrimony, and lived in a
state of celibacy among bagnios. Sometimes he made inroads on private life,
and disturbed the peace of families by debauching the wives and daughters of
his acquaintance. Among other gallant exploits he decoyed up to town the
daughter of a country gentleman, where he ruined her, and then left her to
linger under an infamous disease. At length the fruits of his amour
appeared in a child, which soon perished with it's unhappy parent in a
public hospital. By the same magic of the fancy let us raise up this poor
girl with the infant in her arms, while he is wantoning among his doxies, and
lording it like a Bashaw over the vassals of his lust. What remorse
must this villain have felt, could he have imagined her to have addressed
him in the following terms! 
<Q REND="inline">"Behold in the loathsome carcase of this
babe the image of thy∣self; <PB N="166" REF="171"/> foul, rotten, and
corrupt.—How could I suffer so contemptible a creature to draw me
from the comfort∣able protection of my parents?—It was just that I
should fall a victim to my folly: but was this diseased infant quickened
only to proclaim my dishonour and thy in∣famy?—Why hadst thou yet the
power left to propagate misery even to the innocent?"</Q></P>
<P>TOM had often signalized himself as a duellist: his
conscience, as we have already mentioned, upbraided him at his dying moments
with the murder of a particular friend. He had once ill luck at cards; and
being irritated with his losses, and suspecting foul play on the part
of his antagonist, he took him by the nose, which consequently produced a
challenge. He is hastening to the field of battle:—but he fancies
himself followed by the Manes of his friend, whom on the same unhallowed
ground he had lately sacrificed to that Idol HONOUR. He hears him call—

<Q REND="inline">"Turn, mad∣man, turn, and look on Me.—You
may remember with what reluctance I met you—You forced me to the
com∣bat—and I was even pleased that the victory was yours. You deprived
me of life in an idle quarrel about a crea∣ture, whom at your return from the
murder of your friend you detected in the arms of another.—It was Honour
that induced you to wound the bosom of one you loved:—The same Honour
now calls you to give a fellow whom you despise, an opportunity to
retaliate the injury done to me.—What folly is it to put your life into
the hands of a scoundrel, who you suspect has al∣ready robbed you of your
fortune?—But go on, and let your death rid the world of a monster, who
is desperate enough to put his own life on the hazard, and wicked enough to
attempt that of another."</Q>—It happened, how∣ever, that TOM had no
occasion for such a monitor, as the <PB N="167" REF="172"/> person whom he
went to meet proved as great a coward as he was a cheat; and our hero, after
waiting a full hour in his pumps, and parrying with the air, had no other
revenge for the loss of his money than the satisfaction of posting him
for a scoundrel.</P>
<P>THOUGH the hero of our story was cut off in the prime of his
life, yet he may be said, like <HI>Nestor,</HI> to have outlived three
generations. All the young fellows of spirit were proud to be enrolled in the
list of his companions; but as their constitutions were more puny than his,
three sets of them had dropt into the grave, and left him at the head of the
fourth. He would often boast of the many promising ge∣niusses, who had
fallen in the vain attempt of keeping pace with him in the various scenes of
debauchery. In this light we may consider him as an accessary to so
many wanton murders. By the operation of his conscience, at every tavern door
he might have met with an acquaintance to bar his passage; and in the
midst of his jollity, like <HI>Macbeth,</HI> he would have dashed down his
glass, and imagined that he saw a departed friend filling the vacant
chair.</P>
<P>FROM the nature of the facts which have already been recorded of
TOM DARE-DEVIL, the reader will easily con∣clude that he must have been an
Atheist. No creature, who believed in a SUPREME BEING, could have acted so
vilely towards his fellow-creatures. TOM was president of an abominable club,
who met together every Sunday night to utter the most horrid blasphemies.
The members of this most scandalous society must have heard of the
manner of their great tutor's death:—let us imagine therefore, that they
could figure to themselves his ghost appearing to them, warning them of
their errors, and exhorting them to re∣pent. They might conceive him setting
forth, in the most pathetic manner, the consequences of their folly, and
declar∣ing <PB N="168" REF="173"/> to them how convinced he was of the certainty
of those doctrines which they daily ridiculed. Such an ap∣parition would
indeed have an effect upon common sinners; but in all probability a
thorough-paced infidel would not be reclaimed, even 
<Q REND="inline">"though One rose from the dead."</Q></P>
<P>WHAT I have here supposed might have been the case of one
particular reprobate, is in the power of every per∣son to put in practice for
himself. Nothing is a stronger instance of the goodness of the CREATOR,
than that deli∣cate inward feeling, so strongly impressed on every
reason∣able creature. This internal sense, if duly attended to, and
diligently cherished and kept alive, would check the sinner in his career,
and make him look back with horror on his crimes. An Antient is commended for
wishing, 
<Q REND="inline">"that he had a window in his breast, that
every one might see into it:"</Q> but it is certainly of more consequence
to keep ourselves free from the reproach of our own hearts, than from the
evil opinions of others. We should therefore consider Conscience as a
Mirror, in which every one may see himself reflected, and in which every
action is repre∣sented in its proper colours.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HAT there is a vanity inherent in every author must be
confessed, whatever pains they may take to conceal it from the rest of
mankind. For my own part, I readily acknowledge, that I am always wonder∣fully
delighted with my own productions. I snatch up the favourite sheets wet
from the press, and devour every syllable: not the least particle
escapes my notice, and I dwell with admiration on the beauties of an
expressive <HI>and</HI> or emphatical <HI>the.</HI> If every reader was to
pay the same at∣tention <PB N="170" REF="175"/> to my works, or peruse them
with half the satis∣faction, Mr. TOWN might be fairly pronounced the
greatest author of the age. But I am afraid I shall scarce find another
who will so heartily join in the good opinion I have conceived of myself;
and many a choice senti∣ment, many a culled expression, which I have
repeated to myself over and over again with extacy, has by others perhaps
been as hastily hurried over as any common ar∣ticle in a news-paper.</P>
<P>AN Author, who is ever big with the idea of his own importance,
will gather matter for self-flattery from the most trivial circumstances.
On the mornings of publication I have sometimes made it my business to go
round the coffee houses, in order to receive whatever increase of praise
I could collect from the approbation of my readers. My heart you may imagine
has bounded with joy, when I have heard the room echo with calling for the
CONNOISSEUR: but how has it sunk again, when I have found the same tokens
of esteem shewn to a brother writer! I could have hugged any honest
fellow, that has chuckled over my performan∣ces, and pointed out my good
things:—but I have been no less chagrined, when I have seen a coxcomb
coolly take up my paper, squint over the first page, and throw it down
again with all the indifference imaginable: though indeed I have never failed
within myself to pronounce on such a person, that he is dull, ignorant
and illiterate. I once happened to be seated in the next box to two noted
critics, who were looking over the file of my papers, and seemed particularly
pleased with several parts of them. I im∣mediately conceived a very high
opinion of their taste and judgment: I remarked with singular
satisfaction the effect which my wit and humour had on their countenan∣ces; 
<PB N="171" REF="176"/> and as they turned over the pages, I imagined I could
point out the very passages, which provoked them frequently to smile, and
sometimes to burst into a loud laugh. As soon as they were gone, I
seized the file; when lo! to my great mortification I found they had been
reading, not my own admirable works, but the lucubrations of a brother
essayist.</P>
<P>MY vanity has often prompted me to wish, that I could
accompany my papers wheresoever they are circu∣lated. I flatter myself I
should then be introduced to the politest men of quality, and admitted into
the closets of our finest ladies. This consideration would doubtless
make me vain of myself: but my pride would be soon checked by reflecting
further, that were I obliged to fol∣low my papers afterwards through all their
travels and mutations, I should certainly undergo the shame of seeing
some of them prostituted to the vilest purposes. If in one place I
might be pleased to find them the entertainment of the tea-table, in another
I should be no less vexed to see them degraded to the base office of
sticking up candles. Such is the fatality attending these loose sheets,
that though at their first publication they may be thought as precious as the
<HI>Sibyl</HI>'s leaves, the next moment they may be thrown aside as no
better than a last year's almanack.</P>
<P>EVER since my first appearance in a sheet and a half I
have felt great uneasiness on account of the rude treat∣ment, which my
works have been subject to in their present form. I turned off my printer
for a very hei∣nous affront offered to my delicacy, having detected some foul
proofs of my first numbers lodged in a very un∣seemly <PB N="172" REF="177"/> place; and I almost came to an open rupture with my publisher,
because his wife had converted a supernumerary half-sheet into a
thread-paper. A lady, whose sense and beauty I had always admired,
forfeited my esteem at once by cutting out a pattern for a cap from one of my
papers; and a young fellow, who had spoken very handsomely of one of my
essays, made no scruple to defile the blank margin with a filthy list
of foul shirts and dirty stockings. The repeated abuses of illiterate
bakers, pastry-cooks, and chandlers I know I am condemned to suffer in
common with other mor∣tal writers. It was ever their priviledge to prey
indis∣criminately on all authors good or bad: and as poli∣ticians, wits,
freethinkers, and divines, may have their dust mingled in the same piece of
ground, so may their works be jumbled together in the lining of the same
trunk or band-box.</P>
<P>ONE instance may indeed be brought, in which I am used to
hail as a lucky omen the damages that my papers appear to have sustained in
their outward form and complexion. With what raptures have I traced the
progress of my fame, while I have contemplated my numbers in the public
coffee-houses strung upon a file, and swelling gradually into a little
volume! By the appearance which they make, when thus collected, I have often
judged of the reception they have singly met with from their readers: I have
considered every speck of dirt as a mark of reputation, and have
assu∣med to myself applause from the spilling of coffee or the print
of a greasy thumb. In a word, I look upon each paper, when torn and sullied
by frequent hand∣ling, as an old soldier battered in the service, and
co∣vered with honourable scars.</P>
<P><PB N="173" REF="178"/>I WAS led into this train of thought by an
accident which happened to me the other evening, as I was walking in some
fields near the town. As I went along my curiosity tempted me to examine the
materials of which several paper kites were made up, from whence I had
sufficient room to moralize on the ill fate of authors. On one I discovered
several pages of a ser∣mon expanded over the surface; on another the
wings fluttered with love songs; and a satire on the ministry furnished
another with ballast for the tail. I at length happened to cast my eye on
one taller than the rest, and beheld several of my own darling productions
pasted over it. My indignation was presently raised, that I should
become the plaything of children; and I was even ashamed that the great name
of TOWN, which stared me full in the front, should be exposed, like the
compositions of Dr. <HI>Rock</HI> on the wall, to every idle gazer. However,
by a curious turn of thought I con∣verted what at first seemed a disgrace
into a compliment to my vanity. As the kite rose into the air, I drew a
flattering parallel between the height of it's flight, and the soaring of my
own reputation: I imagined myself lifted up on the wings of fame, and like
<HI>Horace</HI>'s Swan towering above mortality: I fancied my∣self borne like
a blazing star among the clouds, to the admiration of the gazing multitude
below.

<P><PB N="174" REF="179"/>WHILE I was indulging this fantastic
contemplation of my own excellence, I never considered by how slight a
thread my chimaerical importance was supported. The twine broke; and the
kite, together with my airy dreams of immortality, dropt to the ground.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>T a time when Peace spreads her downy wings over contending
nations, and when armies (like the harmless Militia) are drawn into the field
only to be reviewed, all <HI>Europe</HI> must undoubtedly be alarmed to hear
of the bloody battle, which has been lately fought in <HI>England.</HI> It is a
justice due to posterity to preserve a faithful account of this memorable
event: I shall therefore set it down as I find it recorded in those
authentic registers of heroic actions the News-papers, without deviating a
tittle from the ex∣pressive terms in which this extraordinary combat is
related.</P>
<Q REND="inline"><HI>Harlston in Norfolk, July</HI> 30.
Yesterday in the afternoon <HI>Slack</HI> and <HI>Pettit</HI> met and fought.
At the first <HI>Set-to, Pettit</HI> seized <HI>Slack</HI> by the throat,
and held him up against the rails, and <HI>grain'd</HI> him so much as to
make him turn extremely black: this continued for half a minute before
<HI>Slack</HI> could break <HI>Pettit</HI>'s hold; after which for near ten
minutes <PB N="176" REF="181"/> <HI>Pettit</HI> kept fighting and driving hard
at <HI>Slack,</HI> when at length <HI>Slack</HI> clos'd with his antagonist
and gave him a very severe fall, after that a second and third; but between
these falls <HI>Pettit</HI> threw <HI>Slack</HI> twice off the Stage, and
indeed <HI>Pettit</HI> so much dreaded <HI>Slack</HI>'s falls, that he ran
directly at his hams and tumbled him down, and by that means gave
<HI>Slack</HI> an opportu∣nity of making the falls very easy: when they had
been fighting eighteen minutes, the odds ran against <HI>Slack</HI> a guinea
to a shilling; whereas on first setting out, it was three or four to one
on his head; but after this time <HI>Slack shortened Pettit</HI> so, as to
disable him from running and throwing him down in the manner he had done
before, but obliged him to stand to close fighting. <HI>Slack</HI> then
clos'd one of his eyes, and beat him very much about the face. At twenty
minutes <HI>Pettit</HI> grew weak∣er, <HI>Slack</HI> stronger; this was
occasion'd by <HI>Slack's strait</HI> way of fighting. At twenty-two
minutes the best judges allow'd <HI>Slack</HI> to have the advan∣tage over
<HI>Pettit</HI> very considerably, as he was then recovering his <HI>Wind,</HI>
which was owing to <HI>Game:</HI> when they had box'd twenty-four mi∣nutes,
<HI>Pettit</HI> threw <HI>Slack</HI> again over the rails. This indeed
<HI>Slack</HI> suffered him to do, as by that means he fixed a blow under
<HI>Pettit</HI>'s ribs, that hurt him much. Whilst <HI>Slack</HI> was again
getting upon the stage (it was not half a minute before he was remounted)
<HI>Pettit</HI> had so much the fear of his antagonist before his eyes,
that he walked off without so much as civilly taking leave of the
spectators, or saying any thing to any person. This the Cockers call
<HI>roguing of it</HI>; for it is generally thought that <HI>Pettit</HI> ran
away full strong. The whole time of their fighting was twenty-five minutes;
and this morning the BATTLE was given to <HI>Slack,</HI> who drew the first
ten guineas out of the box. Thus ended this dreadful combat.</Q>
<P>EVERY man, who has the honour of the <HI>British</HI> fist
at heart, must look with admiration on the <HI>Bottom,</HI> the
<HI>Wind,</HI> the <HI>Game,</HI> of this invincible champion SLACK. How must
they applaud his address in <HI>fighting strait</HI>; and with what
detestation must they look upon his dastard antagonist, who could so
shamefully <HI>rogue it!</HI> Captain <HI>Godfrey,</HI> the sub∣lime
Historian of these hardy heroes, would have exclaimed on this
occasion;— 
<Q REND="inline">"Hail, mighty SLACK, thou pride of the Butchers!
Let the shambles echo with thy praise, and let marrow-bones and cleavers
proclaim thy glorious triumph. What was that half-bred bruiser <HI>Milo,</HI>
who is celebrated by the ancients for knocking down an ox, to cut out the hide
into thongs for his <HI>Ce<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>us?</HI>
every petty slaughterman of <HI>Clare-market</HI> can perform greater 
<PB N="177" REF="182"/> feats: but thou with resistless arm hast not
only knocked down oxen but made the puny race of barbers, coblers, and watermen
fall before thee."</Q></P>
<P>I CANNOT but lament the cruelty of that law, which has shut up
our Amphitheatres: and I look upon the professors of the noble art of
Boxing as a kind of dis∣banded army, for whom we have made no provision.
The mechanics, who at the call of glory left their mean occu∣pations, are now
obliged to have recourse to them again; and coachmen and barbers resume the
whip and the razor, instead of giving black eyes and cross-buttocks. I know
a veteran that has often <HI>won the whole house,</HI> who is reduced, like
<HI>Belisarius,</HI> to spread his palm in begging for a half∣penny. Some
have been forced to exercise their art in knocking down passengers in
dark alleys and corners; while others have learned to open their fists and
ply their fingers in picking pockets. <HI>Buckhorse,</HI> whose knuckles
had been used to indent many a bruise, now clenches them only to grasp a
link; and <HI>Broughton</HI> employs the muscles of his brawny arm in
squeezing a lemon or drawing a cork. His Amphitheatre itself is converted
into a Methodist Meeting∣house! and perhaps (as laymen are there admitted
into the pulpit) those very fists, which so lately dealt such hearty
bangs upon the stage, are now with equal vehemence thumping the
cushion.</P>
<P>THE dextrous use of the fist is a truly <HI>British</HI>
exercise: and the sturdy <HI>English</HI> have been as much renowned for
their Boxing as their Beef; both which are by no means suited to the watry
stomachs and weak sinews of their enemies the <HI>French.</HI> To this
nutriment and this art is owing that long-established maxim, that one
<HI>Englishman</HI> can beat three <HI>Frenchmen.</HI> A <HI>Frenchman,</HI>
who piddles on <PB N="178" REF="183"/> a fricassee of frogs, can no more
encounter with an <HI>En∣glishman,</HI> who feeds upon beef, than the frog in
the fable could swell her little body to the size of an ox; and from hence
we may conclude, on the principles of philosophy, that the elastic
spring, which darts from the knuckles of an <HI>Englishman,</HI> falls into
the heels of a <HI>Frenchman.</HI> One of my correspondents has already
remonstrated against the degeneracy of the present times in our
shameful neglect of that support of our national strength, Old
<HI>English</HI> Roast Beef. Indeed we can never hope, that any of our
modern heroes would attempt to <HI>fix a blow under the ribs,</HI> when they
are afraid of plunging a knife into a Surloin: and I will venture to say,
that when the times come, that Sur∣loins are no more brought upon the table, we
shall not be able to produce one <HI>Englishman,</HI> who can knock down an
ox.</P>
<P>OUR present race of spindle-shanked beaux had rather
close with an orange wench at the playhouse, than engage in a bye battle at
<HI>Tottenham Court.</HI> It is therefore no wonder, that they should object
to this manly practice, for which they are so ill fitted. How can we imagine,
that they could stand against the buffets of a bruiser, when they might
almost be patted down with the fan of a lady? An attempt was once made by
<HI>Broughton</HI> to bring this study into vogue, by establishing a
School for Boxing, in which he himself was to be the Lecturer. He invited the
young gen∣tlemen of the army, and all other men of spirit, to engage under
his directions; and promised to arm their feeble wrists with mufflers, so
that nothing might be apprehended by the softest head or tenderest
skin. A few indeed were hardy enough to try a fall with him: but most of
our young fellows gave up the gauntlet for scented gloves; and loathing the
mutton fists of vulgar carmen and porters, they rather chose to hang their
hands in a sling, to make them <PB N="179" REF="184"/> white and delicate as a
lady's. I cannot but regret, that this design was not generally encouraged,
as it might per∣haps have abolished almost the only use, that is at
present made of the sword; and men of honour, instead of tilting at each
other, might have had satisfacion in a tight <HI>Set-to</HI> behind
<HI>Mountague House.</HI></P>
<P>THE amusement of Boxing I must confess is more immediately
calculated for the vulgar, who can have no relish for the more refined
pleasures of whist and the hazard table. Men of fashion have found out a
more genteel employment for their hands in shuffling a pack of cards and
shaking the dice: and indeed it will appear upon a strict review, that
most of our fashionable diversions are nothing else but different
branches of gaming. What lady would be able to boast a route at her house
consisting of three or four hundred persons, if they were not to be drawn
together by the charms of playing a rubber? and the prohibition of our jubilee
masquerades is hardly to be regretted, as they wanted the most
essential part of their entertainments, the E. O. table. To this polite
spirit of gaming, which has diffused itself through all the fashion∣able
world, is owing the vast encouragement that is given to the Turf; and
horse-races are esteemed only as they afford occasion for making a bet.
The same spirit like∣wise draws the knowing ones together in a Cock-pit;
and cocks are rescued from the dunghill, and armed with gaffles, to furnish
a new species of gaming. For this reason among others I cannot but regret
the loss of our ele∣gant amusements in <HI>Oxford Road</HI> and
<HI>Tottenham Court.</HI> A great part of the spectators used to be deeply
inte∣rested in what was doing on the stage, and were as earnest to make
an advantage of the issue of the battle, <PB N="180" REF="185"/> as the
champions themselves to draw the largest sum from the box. The
Amphitheatre was at once a school for boxing and gaming. Many thousands
have depended upon a match; the odds have often risen at a black eye; a large
bet has been occasioned by a cross-buttock: and while the house has
resounded with the lusty bangs of the combatants, it has at the same time
echoed with the cries of <HI>five to one, six to one, ten to one.</HI></P>
<P>THE loss of this branch of gaming is a public cala∣mity; and I
doubt not but the gentlemen at <HI>White</HI>'s, and all others whom it
concerns, will use their endeavours to have it restored. The many plates
given all over the kingdom have undoubtedly improved our breed of horses; and
if the diversion of Boxing was to meet with equal encouragement, we should
certainly have a more stout and hardy race of bruisers. It might perhaps
become a fashion for gentlemen, who were fond of the sport, to keep
cham∣pions in training, put them in sweats, diet them, and breed up the human
species with the same care as they do cocks and horses. In course of
time this branch of gaming, like all others, would doubtless be reduced to a
science; and <HI>Broughton,</HI> in imitation of that great genius
<HI>Hoyle,</HI> might oblige the public with a Treatise on the Fist, and
Calculations for laying the Odds at any Match of Boxing.</P>

favoured by my corres∣pondents, I was a good deal pleased with the following.
I shall therefore present it to the reader this day.</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>To Mr. TOWN.</HEAD>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU must have observed a paragraph in the news∣papers
dated from <HI>Dublin,</HI> which informs us, that 
<Q REND="inline">"the spirit of Duelling is now become so
common, that scarce a day passes without one or more being fought in or
near that Metropolis."</Q> I am very much alarmed lest this madness
should cross the seas: to say the truth, I al∣most begin to think it
necessary, that the frequent impor∣tation <PB N="182" REF="187"/> of
<HI>Irishmen</HI> into this kingdom should, for some time, be prohibited;
and an embargo laid on those ships that are freighted with contraband
Duellists. The ladies perhaps may object to this proposal, but it is your
duty, Mr. TOWN, at least to do all in your power to prevent the influence
which the conduct of these heroic gentlemen, who cannot suffer their
swords to sleep quietly in their scabbards, may have on our young
fellows: I must therefore beg of you to put together a few thoughts on this
occasion, and though the subject has been often treated before, I cannot
but ima∣gine that there is sufficient room left for You to expatiate on it.
It is usual among the Bishops, when they find any particular vice prevail,
to send orders to the Clergy of their respective dioceses to preach
against it. In like manner it is your duty, as CENSOR GENERAL, to attack the
reigning follies: and it is surely as easy for You to throw them into a new
light, as it is for the Clergy to preach different sermons on the same
text.</P>
<P>YOU will undoubtedly agree with me that Gaming is one of the
principal causes of Duels, and that many a young fellow has owed his death to
cards and dice. As the gaming-houses are often filled with rogues in lace and
sharpers in embroidery, an honest but rash adventurer often loses his
temper with his money, and begins to suspect that the cards are packed, or
the dice loaded: and then very wisely risks his life because he finds it
impossible to re∣cover his cash. Upon this account I am never witness
to deep play, but it raises very serious reflections in me. When I have
seen a young nobleman offer a large stake, I have considered him as
setting his life upon a card, or (like King <HI>Richard)</HI> 
<Q REND="inline">"laying it upon a cast, and standing the
hazard of the die."</Q> I have even imagined that I heard bullets rattle in the
dice-box, and that I saw challenges written upon every card on the table.</P>
<P><PB N="183" REF="188"/>THE ladies also are frequently the
cause of Duels; though it must be owned, in justice to the better part of
the sex, that where one is fought on account of a modest woman, ten are
occasioned by prostitutes. The stout knights-errant, who entertain a
passion for the faith∣less <HI>Dulcineas</HI> of <HI>Drury-Lane</HI> and
<HI>Covent-Garden,</HI> find frequent opportunities of manifesting their
prowess. They not only encounter with bullies and bravoes, but some∣times
meet with other enamoratoes as fond and as mad as themselves. I am
personally acquainted with two gen∣tlemen of this turn, who held out
pistols at each other across a bed at one of these ladies lodgings, and
tossed up which should fire first. The pistol however luckily mist
fire, and gave them time to think better of it: so they very amicably shook
hands, laid down their pistols, and went to bed to the lady together. These
females are not content, it seems, with the conquests commonly made by the
fair, but often pass a more cruel sentence on their captives. Their lovers
not only suffer those meta∣phorical deaths which all their tribe must
endure, but are often really killed in serious truth and sober sadness.
They are not only shot through the heart by an accidental glance of the eyes,
but often have a brace of balls lodged in their heads; and are not only 
<Q REND="inline">"stabbed through the liver (as
<HI>Mercutio</HI> has it) by the blind bow-boy's butt-shaft,"</Q> but they
may perhaps be engaged in a duel with a rival, in which they are run through
the body.</P>
<P>A FOREIGN Count was once challenged by one of these
hot-headed gentlemen, and I shall conclude my letter by recommending his
method to our modern Duelists. The place of battle appointed was the Count's
house, and when the furious challenger came in, breathing nothing but
re∣venge, he was surprized to find the Count sitting very 
<PB N="184" REF="189"/> composedly with a candle and a barrel at his side. 
<Q REND="inline">"This, Sir, said the Count, is a barrel of
gunpowder, and if you please we will take our chance who shall set fire
to it, you or I."</Q> The gentleman amazed at this expe∣dient made no answer;
upon which the Count lighted a match, and waving it over the mouth of the
barrel, cried out, 
<Q REND="inline">"Get out of the room, Sir, or I will set
fire to the powder this instant."</Q> This abated our challeger's wrath so
considerably, that the Count was rid of him in a moment, and he was glad to
leave the room without any satisfac∣tion.—I shall expect something
from you on this subject and am,</P>

</LETTER>
<P>I SHALL not refuse my correspondent my animadversions on
this subject, but as I am not inclined to measure swords on this
occasion with any of my predecessors or cotempo∣raries, I shall
expatiate in an entire new field, and appear in the cause as an advocate for
Duelling. The vices and follies of the fashionable world are so connected
with each other, that they almost form a regular system, and the
prac∣tice of them all is absolutely necessary to complete the cha∣racter
of a Fine Gentleman. A Fine Gentleman (in the modern sense of the word) is
one that whores, games, and wears a sword. Running after loose women is
indeed in some measure common to this exhalted part of mankind with the
vulgar: but to live in bagnios, to be kept in repair by <HI>Rock</HI> or
<HI>Ward</HI> by the quarter, to be in a continual course of pill and
electuary, and to make a business of fornication is the peculiar privilege
of a Fine Gentleman. Gaming is also an essential requisite to this
character, and is indeed capable of itself to create a person a Gentleman
who has no other pretensions to that title. The greatest scoundrels
pro∣vided <PB N="185" REF="190"/> they were gamesters, have always been
permitted to associate with people of fashion; and perhaps they hold
their title to the best company by the same tenure that the Knaves keep
their rank among the honours in a pack of cards. But the grand
distinguishing mark of a Fine Gen∣tleman is the wearing a sword.
Gentility displays itself in a well-fancied sword-knot, and honour lies
sheathed in the scabbard. All who bear arms have a claim to this
charac∣ter: even our common soldiers (like the knights of old) are dubbed
Gentlemen on the shoulder with this only difference, that instead of the
sword, the ceremony is performed by a brown musket.</P>
<P>UPON these and many other weighty considerations I have
resolved not to disturb the tranquility of the polite world by railing at
their darling vices. A CENSOR may endeavour to new-cock a hat, to raise the
stays, or write down the short petticoat, at his pleasure. Persons of
quality will vary fashions of themselves, but will always adhere steadily
to their vices. I have lately received several letters from sur∣geons and
younger brothers desiring me to promote as far as lays in my power the modern
way of life, and especially the practice of Duelling. The former open their
case in the most pathetic terms, and assure me that if it was not for
Duels, and the amorous rencontres of Fine Gentlemen with the other sex, their
profession would scarce support them. As to the young gentlemen they
inveigh bitterly against the une∣qual distribution of property by the laws of
<HI>England,</HI> and offer me very considerable bribes if I will espouse
the cause of Duels and Debauchey; without which they scarce have any
tolerable chance of coming in for the family estate.</P>
<P>SWIFT somewhere observes that those differences very
rarely happen among men of sense, and he does not see any great harm, if
two worthless fellows send each other out of the world. I shall therefore
humbly propose, the more ef∣fectually to keep up this spirit, that Duels
may be included in the Licence-Act among our other public diversions, with 
<PB N="186" REF="191"/> a restraining clause taking away all power from the
Justices to prohibit these entertainments. I would also propose, for
the better accommodation of the public, that scaffolds be erected behind
<HI>Montague House,</HI> or in any other convenient place, as there are now
at <HI>Tyburn</HI>; and that whenever any two Gentlemen quarrel, they shall
insert their challenges in the Daily Papers after the following manner in
imitation of the late champions at <HI>Broughton</HI>'s.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE following letter will, I fear, disoblige a great many of
my readers, as it strikes at a custom which perhaps they may reckon very
inoffensive; though like all others it may sometimes be indulged to an
excess. How∣ever, as I confess MYSELF not entirely excluded from the
censure, I shall say nothing on the subject, but leave my
correspondent to speak for himself.</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>To Mr. TOWN.</HEAD>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I KNOW not whether you yourself are addicted to a filthy
practice, which is frequent among all ranks of people, though detestable even
among the lowest. The practice I mean is that of snuff-taking; which I
cannot help regarding as a national plague, that like another epidemical
distemper <PB N="188" REF="193"/> has taken hold of our noses. You authors
may perhaps claim it as a priviledge, since snuff is supposed by you to
whet the invention, and every one is not possessed of BAYES's admirable
receipt, the "Spirit of Brains:"—but give me leave to tell you, that
snuff should no more be administered in public, than that of
<HI>Major</HI>'s medicinal composition at fourpence a pinch, or any other
dose of physick. I know not why people should be allowed to annoy their
friends and acquaintance by smearing their noses with a dirty pow∣der, any
more than in using an eye-water, or rubbing their teeth with a
dentifrice.</P>
<P>IF a stranger to this nasty custom was to observe
almost every one 
<Q REND="inline">"drawing out his pouncet-box, and ever and
anon giving it to his nose,"</Q> he would be led to conclude, that we were no
better than a nation of <HI>Hottentots</HI>; and that every one was obliged to
cram his nostrils with a quantity of scented dirt, to fence them from the
disagree∣able effluvias of the rest of the company. Indeed it might not be
absurd in such a stranger to imagine, that the person he conversed
with took snuff, for the same reason that another might press his
nostrils together between his finger and thumb, to exclude an ill
smell.</P>
<P>IT is customary among those polite people the
<HI>Dutch,</HI> to carry with them every where their short dingy pipes, and
smoak and spit about a room even in the presence of ladies. This piece of
good-breeding, however ridiculous it may seem, is not surely more
offensive to good manners than the practice of snuff-taking: a very
<HI>Dutchman</HI> would think it odd, that a people who pretend to politeness
should be continually snuffing up a parcel of tobacco dust; nor can I
help laughing, when I see a man every minute stealing out a dirty
muckender, then sneaking it in again, as much <PB N="189" REF="194"/>
ashamed of his pocket companion, as he would be to carry a dishclout about
him.</P>
<P>IT is indeed impossible to go into any large company
without being disturbed by this abominable practice. The church and the
playhouse continually echoe with this mu∣sick of the nose, and in every
corner you may hear them in concert snuffling, sneezing, hawking, and
grunting like a drove of hogs. The most pathetic speech in a tragedy has
been interrupted by the blowing of noses in the front and side boxes; and I
have known a whole congregation suddenly raised from their knees in the
middle of a prayer by the violent coughing of an old lady, who has been
almost choaked by a pinch of snuff in giving vent to an ejacula∣tion. A
celebrated actor has spoiled his voice by this absurd treatment of his
nose, which has made his articulation like the hum of a bag-pipe; and the
parson of our parish is often forced to break off in the middle of a period
to snort behind his white handkerchief.</P>
<P>IS it not a wonder, Mr. TOWN, that snuff, which is
cer∣tainly an enemy to dress, should yet gain admittance among those who
have no other merit than their cloaths? I am not to be told, that your men of
fashion take snuff only to display a white hand perhaps, or the
brilliancy of a dia∣mond ring: and I am confident that numbers would never have
defiled themselves with the use of snuff, had they not been seduced by
the charms of a fashionable box. The man of taste takes his
<HI>Strasburgh veritable tabac</HI> from a right <HI>Paris</HI> paper-box,
and the pretty fellow uses a box of po∣lished metal, that by often opening
it he may have the op∣portunity of stealing a glance at his own sweet
person reflected in the lid of it.</P>
<P><PB N="190" REF="195"/>THOUGH I abhor snuff-taking myself,
and would as soon be smothered in a cloud raised by smoking tobacco as
I would willingly suffer the least atom of it to tickle my nose, yet am I
exposed to many disgusting inconveniences from the use of it by others.
Sometimes I am choaked by drawing in with my breath some of the finest
particles together with the air; and I am frequently set a sneezing by the
odo∣rous effluvias arising from the boxes that surround me. But it is not
only my olfactory sense that is offended: you will stare when I tell you,
that I am forced to taste, and even to eat and drink this abominable snuff.
If I drink tea with a certain lady, I generally perceive what escapes from
her fingers swimming at the top of my cup; but it is always attributed to the
foulness of the milk or dross of the sugar: I never dine at a particular
friend's house, but I am sure to have as much rappee as pepper with my
turnips; nor can I drink my table-beer out of the same mug with him, for fear
of coughing from his snuff, if not the liquor, going the wrong way. Such
eternal snuff-takers as my friend should, I think, at meal-times have a
screen flapping down over the nose and mouth, under which they might convey
their food, as you may have seen at the Masquerade: at least they
should be separated from the rest of the company, and placed by
themselves at the side-table like the children.</P>
<P>THIS practice of snuff-taking, however inexcusable in the
men, is still more abominable in the other sex. Neat∣ness and
cleanliness ought to be always cultivated among the women; but nothing is
more opposite to clean linnen than this trick of bedawbing themselves with
snuff. I have with pain observed the snow-white surface of an
handkerchief or apron sullied with the scatterings from the snuff-box;
and whenever I see a lady besmeared thus with <HI>Scotch</HI> or
<HI>Havan∣nah,</HI> I consider her as no cleanlier than the kitchen wench 
<PB N="191" REF="196"/> scouring her brasses, and begrimed with
brickdust and ful∣ler's earth. Housewifely accomplishments are at
present seldom required in a well-bred woman: or else I should little
expect to find notableness in a wife who keeps up such a constant
correspondence between her fingers and nose; nor indeed would any one think
her hands at all fit to be employed in making a pudding.</P>
<P>IT should be remembered by the younger part of your fair
readers, Mr. TOWN, that snuff is an implacable enemy to the complexion, which
in time is sure to take a tinge from it: they should therefore be as
cautious of acquiring a sallow hue from this bane of a fair skin, as of
being tanned or freckled by exposing their delicate faces to the scorching
rays of the sun. Besides, as the nose has been always reck∣oned a
principal if not the chief ornament of the face, they should be as careful to
preserve the beauty of it as of any other feature, and not suffer it to be
undermined or bloated by so pernicious an application as snuff-taking. For
my own part, I should as soon admire a celebrated toast with no nose at
all, as to see it prostituted to so vile a purpose. They should
also consider, that the nose is situated very near the lips: and what
relish can a lover find in the honey of the latter, if at the same time he
is obliged to come into close contact with the former. Rather than
snuff-taking should prevail among the ladies, I could wish it were the
fashion for them to wear rings in their noses like the savage nations:
nay, I would even carry it still farther, and oblige those pretty females,
who could be still slaves to snuff, to have their nostrils bored
through as well their ears, and in∣stead of jewels to bear rolls of pigtail
bobbing over their upper lips.</P>
<P><PB N="192" REF="197"/>WE cannot otherwise account for this
fashion among the women so unnatural to their sex, than that they want
em∣ployment for their hands. It was formerly no reflection for a young lady to
be seen in the best company busied with her work: but a girl now a days
would as soon be surprized in twirling a spinning wheel as in handling a
thread-paper. The fan or the snuff-box are now the only implements they dare
to use in publick: yet surely it would be much more becoming to have the
fore-finger pricked and scarified with the point of a needle, than to see
it embrowned with squeezing together a filthy pinch of snuff.</P>
<P>I HAVE said enough, I dare say, already to make many of
your readers turn up their noses at me in disdain; but however let them
<HI>take snuff</HI> as much as they will, you may depend on the good word of
one at least, and that is</P>

<HEAD>To Mr. TOWN.</HEAD>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> REMEMBER to have seen a little <HI>French</HI> Novel
giving an account of a citizen of <HI>Paris</HI> making an excursion into the
country. He imagines himself about to undertake a long voyage to some
strange region, where the natives were as different from the inhabitants of
his own city as the most distant nations. He accordingly takes boat, and is
landed at a villiage about a league from the capital. When he is set on
shore, he is amazed to find the people <PB N="194" REF="199"/> talk the same
language, wear the same dress, and use the same customs with
himself. He who had spent all his life within the sight of <HI>Pont
Neuf,</HI> looked upon every one who lived out of <HI>Paris</HI> as a
foreigner; and though the utmost extent of his travels was not three miles,
he was as much surprized, as he would have been to meet with a colony of
<HI>Frenchmen</HI> on the <HI>Terra Incognita.</HI></P>
<P>MOST of our late novels are, with some little variation of
circumstances, borrowed from the <HI>French:</HI> but if we should
endeavour to adapt the novel I have been speaking of to a citizen of
<HI>London,</HI> the humour of the whole piece would evaporate, and the fiction
become unnatural and improbable. A <HI>London</HI> tradesman is as well
acquainted with <HI>Turnham-Green</HI> or <HI>Kentish-Town</HI> as
<HI>Fleet-street</HI> or <HI>Cheapside,</HI> and talks as familiarly of
<HI>Richmond</HI> or <HI>Hampton-Court</HI> as of the <HI>Change</HI> or the
<HI>Custom House.</HI> In your late paper On the Amusements of Sunday you
have set forth in what manner our citizens pass that day, which most of
them devote to the country: but I wish you had been more particular in your
descrip∣tions of those elegant rural mansions, which at once shew the
opulence and the taste of our principal merchants, me∣chanics, and
artificers.</P>
<P>IN these dusty retreats, where the want of <HI>London</HI>
smoke is supplied by the smoke of <HI>Virginia</HI> tobacco, our chief
citi∣zens are accustomed to pass the end and the beginning of every week.
Their Boxes (as they are modestly called) are generally built in a row, to
resemble as much as possible the streets in <HI>London.</HI> Those
edifices which stand single, and at a distance from the road, have always
a summer-house at the end of a small garden; which being erected upon a
wall adjoining to the highway commands a view of every carriage, and gives the
owner an opportunity of displaying <PB N="195" REF="200"/> his best wig to
every passenger. A little artificial fountain, spouting water sometimes
to the amazing height of four feet and in which frogs supply the want of
fishes, is one of the most exquisite ornaments in these gardens. There
are be∣sides (if the spot of ground allows sufficient space for them)
very curious statues of <HI>Harlequin, Scaramouch, Pierrot,</HI> and
<HI>Columbine,</HI> which serve to remind their wives and daughters of what
they have seen at the play-house.</P>
<P>I WENT last Sunday, in compliance with a most pressing
invitation from a friend, to spend the whole day with him at one of these
little seats, which he had fitted up for his retirement once a week from
business. It is pleasantly situa∣ted about three miles from
<HI>London,</HI> on the side of a public road, from which it is separated
by a dry ditch, over which is a little bridge confirming of two narrow planks,
leading to the house. The hedge on the other side the road cuts off all
prospect whatsoever, except from the garrets, from whence indeed you have a
beautiful vista of two men hang∣ing in chains on <HI>Kennington</HI> Common,
with a distant view of St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s Cupola enveloped in a cloud of
smoke. I set out on my visit betimes in the morning, accompanied with my
friend's book-keeper, who was my guide, and carried over with him the
<HI>London Evening Post,</HI> his mistress's hoop, and a dozen of pipes,
which they were afraid to trust in the chair. When I came to the end of my
walk, I found my friend sitting at the door in a black velvet cap, smoking
his morning pipe. He welcomed me into the country, and after having made me
observe the turnpike on my left and the <HI>Golden Wheatsheaf</HI> on my
right, he conducted me into his house, where I was received by his lady, who
made a thou∣sand apologies for being catched in such a dishabille.</P>
<P><PB N="196" REF="201"/>THE hall (for so I was taught to call
it) had its white wall almost hid by a curious collection of prints and
paintings. On one side was a large map of <HI>London,</HI> a plan and
elevation of the Mansion-House, with several lesser views of the
pub∣lic buildings and halls; on the other was the Death of the Stag by the
happy pencil of Mr. <HI>Henry Overton,</HI> finely coloured: close by the
parlour door there hung a pair of stag's horns, over which there was laid
across a red Roccelo and an amber-headed cane. When I had declared all this
to be mighty pretty, I was shewn into the parlour, and was presently
asked, who that was over the chimney-piece. I pronounced it to be a very
striking likeness of my friend, who was drawn bolt upright in a
full-bottomed perriwig, a laced cravat with the fringed ends appearing thro' a
button∣hole, a black livery gown, a snuff-coloured velvet coat with gold
buttons, a red velvet waistcoat trimmed with gold, one hand stuck in the
bosom of his shirt, and the other holding out a letter with the
superscription—<HI>To Mr. — Common-Council-Man of Faringdon
Ward Without.</HI> My eyes were then directed to another figure in a scarlet
gown, who I was informed was my friend's wife's great great uncle, and had been
sheriff and knighted in the reign of King <HI>James</HI> the first. Madam
herself filled up a pannel on the opposite side, in the habit of a
shepherdess, smelling to a nosegay, and stroking a ram with gilt
horns.</P>
<P>I WAS then invited by my friend to see what he was pleased
to call his garden, which was nothing more than a yard about twenty feet in
length, and contained about a dozen little pots ranged on each side with
lillies and coxcombs, supported by some old laths painted green, with bowls
of tobacco-pipes on their tops. At the end of this garden he bade me take
notice of a little square building surrounded <PB N="197" REF="202"/> with
filleroy, which he told me an Alderman of great taste had turned into a
Temple, by erecting some battlements and spires of painted wood on the
front of it; but concluded with an hint, that I might retire to it upon
occasion.</P>
<P>AFTER dinner, when my friend had finished his pipe, he
proposed taking a walk, that we might enjoy a little of the country: so I
was obliged to trudge along the foot path by the road-side, while my friend
went puffing and blowing, with his hat in his hand, and his wig half off his
head. At last I told him it was time for me to return home, when he
insisted on going with me as far as the half-way house, to drink a
decanter of Stingo before we parted. We here fell into company with a brother
liveryman of the same ward, and I left them both together in an high
dispute about <HI>Can∣ning</HI>; but not before my friend had made me
promise to repeat my visit to his country-house the next Sunday.</P>
<P>AS the riches of a country are visible in the number of its
inhabitants, and the elegance of their dwellings, we may venture to say that
the present state of <HI>England</HI> is very flou∣rishing and
prosperous: and if the taste for building encreases with our opulence for
the next century, we shall be able to boast of finer country seats
belonging to our shop-keepers, artificers, and other plebeians, than the
most pompous de∣scriptions of <HI>Italy</HI> or <HI>Greece</HI> have ever
recorded. We read it is true of country-seats, belonging to <HI>Pliny,
Hortensius, Lucullus,</HI> and other <HI>Romans.</HI> They were patricians of
great rank and fortune: there can therefore be no doubt of the excellence of
their <HI>Villas.</HI> But who has ever read of a <HI>Chinese</HI>-bridge
belonging to a <HI>roman</HI> pastry-cook? or could any of their Shoemakers
or taylors boast a <HI>Villa</HI> with his tin cascades, paper statutes,
and <HI>Gothic</HI> root-houses? Upon <PB N="198" REF="203"/> the above
principles we may expect, that posterity will perhaps see a cheesmonger's
<HI>Apiarium</HI> at <HI>Brentford,</HI> a poul∣terer's <HI>Theriotrophium</HI>
at <HI>Chiswick,</HI> and an <HI>Ornithon</HI> in a fishmonger's garden at
<HI>Putney.</HI></P>
<P>AS a patriot and an <HI>Englishman</HI> I cannot but wish,
that each successive century should encrease the opulence of
<HI>Great Britain:</HI> but I should be sorry, that this abundance of
wealth should induce our good citizens to turn their thoughts too much upon
the country. At present we are deprived of our most eminent tradesmen two
days out of six. It is true the shopkeeper and the travelling part of his
family, consist∣ing generally of himself, his wife, and his two eldest
daugh∣ters, are seldom sufficiently equipped to take leave of
<HI>London,</HI> till about three o'clock on Saturday in the afternoon; but the
whole morning of that day is consumed in papering up cold chickens, bottling
brandy-punch, sorting clean shifts, and night-caps for the children,
pinning baskets, and cord∣ing trunks; as again is the whole afternoon of the
Monday following, in unpinning, uncording, locking up foul linnen, and
replacing empty bottles in the cellar. I am afraid there∣fore, if the
<HI>Villas</HI> of our future tradesmen should become so very elegant,
that the shop-keepers will scarce ever be visible behind their counters
above once in a month.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="body of issue">
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE <HI>French</HI> have distinguished the artifices made
use of on the stage to deceive the audience, by the expression of
<HI>Jeu de Theâtre,</HI> which we may translate "the Juggle of the
Theatre." When these little arts are exercised merely to assist
nature and set her off to the best advantage, none can be so critically
nice as to object to them; but when tragedy by these means is lifted into
rant, and comedy distorted into buffoonery, though the deceit may succeed
with the multitude, men of sense will always be offended at it. This
conduct, whether of the poet or the player, resembles in some sort the
poor contrivance of the ancients, who mounted their heroes upon stilts, and
expressed the manners of their characters by the grotesque figures of
their masks.</P>
<P><PB N="200" REF="205"/>AS the playhouses are now opened, I
cannot better intro∣duce the remarks which I may sometimes take occasion to
make on the theatrical world, than by throwing together a few reflections on
this "Juggle of the Theatre;" which at present I shall consider, only as
it relates to the actors. And I hope to merit the thanks of these gentlemen,
who while they are sollicitous to acquire new beauties, should at the
same time endeavour to unlearn their faults and imperfections.</P>
<P>WE are indebted to the present times for a judicious
re∣formation of the stage in point of acting: and (by the bye) I could
wish, that the same good consequences had been produced with respect to
our poets. If a perfect tragedy may be considered as the most difficult
production of human wit, the same thing must hold in proportion with
respect to an exact representation of it: for if it is necessary for
the writer to work up his imagination to such a pitch as to fancy himself
in the circumstances of the character he draws; what less must the actor
do, who must look as the person represented would look, speak as he
would speak, and be in every point the very man? The generation of players,
that immediately preceded the present, prided themselves on what they
called <HI>fine speaking:</HI> the emotions of the soul were disregarded
for a distinct delivery; and with them, as Mr. <HI>Johnson</HI> has
observed of some tragic writers, 
<Q> 
<L>"Declamations roar'd, while passion slept."</L></Q>
And, indeed, to this superficial taste for acting we may partly attribute
that enervate way of writing so much in vogue among the frenchified
play-wrights of those times; since nothing could be so well suited to
the mouths of those actors, as golden lines, round periods, florid
descriptions, and a dispassionate amplification of sentiment. 
<Q><PB N="201" REF="206"/> 
<L>—dedit <HI>ore rotundo</HI></L> 
<L>Musa loqui.—</L> 
<BIBL>HOR.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>THE false majesty, with which our mimic heroes of the
stage had been used to express themselves, was for a long time as
distinguishing a mark of tragedy, as the plumed hat and full-bottomed
perriwig; and we may remember for ex∣ample, when every line in Othello, (a
character remarkable for variety of passions,) was drawn out in the same
pompous manner. But as I mean to promote the art, rather than reprove the
artists, I shall dwell on this no longer: for me∣thinks I hear a veteran
performer calling out to me in the voice of honest <HI>Jack Falstaff,</HI> 
<Q REND="inline">"no more of that, if thou lovest me,
<HI>Hal.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>IT is sufficient to remark that, as the dignity of the
buskin would be degraded by talking in a strain too low and fami∣liar, the
manner of elocution in a tragedy should not on either hand be more remote
from our natural way of ex∣pressing ourselves, than blank verse (which
is the only proper measure for tragedy) is from prose. Our present set
of actors have in general discarded the dead insipid pomp applauded in
their predecessors, and have wisely endeavoured to join with the poet in
exciting pity and terror. But as many writers have mistaken rant for
passion, and fustian for sublime, so our players have perhaps too
much given into unnatural startings, roarings, and whinings. For this
reason our late writers (to accommodate their pieces to the present
taste) have placed their chief <HI>pathos</HI> in exclamations and broken
sentences, have endeavoured to alarm us with <HI>Ahs</HI> and <HI>Ohs,</HI>
and pierce our souls with interjections. Upon the whole, it must be
acknowled, that the stage is considerably improved in the Art of Speaking.
Every passion is now distinguished by it's proper tone of voice: I
shall therefore <PB N="202" REF="207"/> only add, that when I hear a player
laboriously placing an unnatural stress upon particular words, and
panting with emphasis, I cannot help comparing him to the paviour, who at
every thump of his rammer cries <HI>hem.</HI></P>
<P>I HAVE observed, that the tragedians of the last age
studied <HI>fine speaking</HI>; in consequence of which, all their Action
consisted in little more than strutting with one leg before the other,
and waving one or both arms in a con∣tinual see-saw. Our present actors
have perhaps run into a contrary extreme: their gestures sometimes
resemble those afflicted with <HI>St. Vitus</HI>'s Dance; their whole frame
appears to be convulsed; and I have seen a player in the last act so
miserably distressed, that a deaf spectator would be apt to imagine
he was complaining of the cholic and the tooth∣ach. This has also given
rise to that unnatural custom of throwing the body into various strange
ATTITUDES. There is not a passion necessary to be expressed, but
has produced dispositions of the limbs not to be found in any of the
paintings or sculptures of the best masters. A graceful gesture and
easy deportment is indeed worthy the care of every performer: but when I
observe him writhing his body into more unnatural contortions than a tumbler
at <HI>Sadler's Wells,</HI> I cannot help being disgusted to see him 
<Q REND="inline">"imitate humanity so abominably."</Q> Our
Pantomime authors have already begun to reduce our comedies into grotesque
scenes; and if this taste for <HI>attitude</HI> should continue to be
popular, I would recommend it to those ingenious gentlemen to adapt our
best tragedies to the same use, and entertain us with the jealousy of
<HI>Othello</HI> in dumb shew, or the tricks of <HI>Harlequin
Hamlet.</HI></P>
<P>BEFORE I dismiss this article, it may be expected that I
should say something concerning the behaviour proper for 
<PB N="203" REF="208"/> our ladies. We must allow them on all occasions to
roll the eye, stretch up the neck, heave the chest, and with a thousand
little tricks set off their person, if not their part, to the most
advantage. The pomp of the old stage has not yet been altogether reformed,
either with respect to our heroines or our heroes. A weeping princess
(though per∣haps she is hurried on the stage with grief and despair)
cannot decently make her entrance without being led in between two mourning
damsels in black; and an heroine must always be accompanied by one or more
pages, to smooth her train when ruffled by passion. The heroe now
seldom sweats beneath the weight of a nodding plume of swan feathers, or
has his face half hid within an enormous bush of white horse hair: I could
also wish (if possible) that the manager was saved the
unnecessary expence of three yards of velvet for the trains of his Amazons,
and that the chambermaids (as well as the militia of the theatres) were
dismissed, and the pages, together with the dirty lords in waiting,
blotted out of the mute <HI>Dramatis Personae.</HI></P>
<P>THE mention of these particulars naturally reminds me to
consider how far "the Juggle of the Theatre" is concerned in the affair of
Dress. Many will agree with me, that al∣most the only distress of the
last act in the <HI>Fair Penitent</HI> arises from the pitiful appearance
of <HI>Calista</HI> in weeds, with every thing hung in black bays about her;
and they are afraid we should lose sight of <HI>Hamlet</HI>'s pretended
madness, if the black stocking, discovering a white one underneath, was
not rolled half-way down the leg. A propriety in dress is absolutely
necessary to keep up the general decep∣tion; and a performer properly
habited, who by his whole deportment enters deeply into the circumstances of
the cha∣racter he represents, makes us for a while fancy every thing before
us real; but when, by some ill-judged piece of art, <PB N="204" REF="209"/> he
departs from the simplicity of imitation, and 
<Q REND="inline">"oversteps the modesty of nature,"</Q> he
calls us back to the theatre, and excites passions very different from
those he aims at.</P>
<P>I CANNOT better illustrate what has been said on this last
subject, than by giving instances of two artifices of this kind; one of
which is employed (as I conceive) to raise pity and the other terror. When
the <HI>Romeo</HI> of <HI>Drury Lane</HI> comes to die at <HI>Juliet</HI>'s
monument we are surprized to see him enter in a suit of black. This I
suppose is entended as a stroke of the pathetic: but not to dwell on the
poverty of the artifice, it is in this place a manifest violation of the
poet's meaning. <HI>Romeo</HI> is supposed to come post from
Mantua— 
<Q REND="inline">"get me post-horses, I will hence to
night"</Q>—so that if our <HI>Roscius</HI> must be so very exact
in dressing the character, he should appear at the tomb in a riding frock
and boots. But a mourning coat will excite <HI>pity,</HI> 
<Q REND="inline">"and let the devil wear black, (says our
<HI>Hamlet-Romeo</HI>) for I'll have a suit of sables."</Q>—The
same player, after having acted that noble scene in the second act of
<HI>Macbeth</HI> in so fine a manner, that one would almost imagine both
the poet and player must have murderers to represent one so well, goes
out to execute the supposed murder. After a short space he returns as
from the fact: but though the expression in his face is still remarkably
excellent, one cannot but smile to observe that he has been employing
himself behind the scenes in putting his wig awry, and untying one of the
tyes to it. This doubtless is designed to raise <HI>terror</HI>; but to
every discerning spectator it must appear most absurdly ridiculous;
for who can forbear laughing, when he finds that the player would have us
imagine, that the same deed, which has thrown all that horror and confusion
into his countenance, has also un∣twisted one of the tails of his
perriwig?</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>S I am willing to do every thing in my power to celebrate so
illustrious a body as the <HI>Robin Hood</HI> Society, I have taken the
first opportunity of laying the following letter before the public.</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>To Mr. TOWN.</HEAD>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THAT part of your last paper, in which you con∣sidered the
Art of Speaking as far as it regards the∣atrical performances, gives me
reason to hope that you will not overlook the merits of the <HI>Robin
Hood</HI> Society, where that Art is practised in it's greatest perfection.
You would do well to recommend it to the gentlemen of the theatre to attend
those weekly meetings for their improve∣ment <PB N="206" REF="211"/> as often
as possible; and I dare say you will join with me in giving the same
advice to the younger part of our clergy and our lawyers, as well as our
members of par∣liament. The stage, the pulpit, the bar, and the
senate-house cannot furnish us with such glorious examples of the power
of Oratory, as are to be met with in this society; where the most important
questions in every branch of knowledge are discussed, and where the
disputants are all of them equally versed in religion, law, politics, and
the drama.</P>
<P>THE institution of this School of Eloquence far exceeds any
thing that the ancients could boast. Every sect, that was known among the
<HI>Grecians</HI> and <HI>Romans,</HI> has it's votaries here also. I have
seen a taylor a <HI>Stoic,</HI> a shoemaker a <HI>Pla∣tonist,</HI> and a
cook an <HI>Epicurean.</HI> They affect to entertain a profound veneration for
<HI>Socrates,</HI> often preferring him to any of the Apostles: but instead
of declaring with that wise philosopher that they know nothing, the members
of the <HI>Robin Hood</HI> Society profess to know every thing.</P>
<P>FOR my own part, I confess myself so charmed with their
proceedings, that I constantly attend them: and when I see all their
members assembled with each his pewter mug before him, I cannot help
preferring this social meet∣ing to any ancient <HI>Symposium</HI> whatever;
and when I further observe them first take a swig, and then speak with
such amazing force of argument, I am apt to conclude that truth, instead of
being hid in a well (as was said by an old philosopher) must lay at the
bottom of a tankard of porter.</P>
<P>THERE is no grace or excellence in Oratory; but is
dis∣played in the <HI>Robin Hood</HI> Society to the greatest advantage.
<HI>Demosthenes</HI> being asked what was the first quality in an orator,
replied—action; what the second,—action; what 
<PB N="207" REF="212"/> the third,—action. Upon this principle one of the
mem∣bers, for whom I have a vast respect, is the greatest orator that
ever lived. He never troubles himself about the order or substance of
what he delivers, but waves his hand, tosses his head, abounds in several
new and beautiful gestures, and from the beginning of his speech to the end
of it takes no care but to set it off with action. <HI>Tully</HI> tells us,
that it is the business of an orator 
<Q REND="inline">"to prove, delight, and convince."</Q> Proof
and conviction our Society is always sure to give us; for else how could it
ever come to pass, that so many young men should have learned from
these disquisitions, that there is no God, that the soul is mortal,
that religion is a jest, and many other truths, which they would otherwise
never have discovered. The nature of their questions is also for the
most part so entertaining, that the disputes about them cannot fail of
giving delight: and there is a peculiarity in the oratory of the place, which
greatly conduces to that end. The speakers do not always think themselves
obliged to drive in the dull direct road to the point, but indulge themselves
in a larger scope that allows room for novelty and entertainment. When the
question has been concerning the veracity of the bible, I have known a
gentleman get up, and beginning with <HI>William</HI> the Conqueror give the
audience an abstract of as many reigns, as his five minutes would allow him
to dispatch. I lately remember the question to have been 
<Q REND="inline">"Whether a bridge from <HI>Black Fryars</HI>
to <HI>South∣wark</HI> would be of public benefit;"</Q> when a facetious
gentleman employed himself in demonstrating the great utility of the bridge
of the nose, and the bridge of a fid∣dle. In a word, our orators are at once
serious and comi∣cal; and they make gravity and mirth almost constantly
at∣tend each other, like their own <HI>Robin Hood</HI> and <HI>Little
John.</HI> The solidity, and at the same time the smartness of 
<PB N="208" REF="213"/> their speeches, are equally remarkable. They pun with
a grave face, and make quibbles and conundrums with the air of a philosopher.
The writings of different authors have been compared to wines: but the orations
delivered here can be resembled to nothing so properly as the liquors of
the Society; for while they are at once so weighty and so sharp, they
seem to be an equal mixture of porter and lemonade.</P>
<P>IT would be endless to enumerate the advantages resulting
from this Society: The wonderful improvement it has al∣ready made in our
mechanics is very evident: It calls off our tradesmen from the
<HI>practice</HI> of honesty in their com∣mon dealings, and sets them upon
<HI>enquiries</HI> concerning right and wrong, and the moral fitness of
things. The SPECTATOR has told us of the rhetoric of a toyman: but you, Mr.
TOWN, might acquaint posterity of the eloquence of bakers, barbers,
carpenters, and blacksmiths: you may every day hear discourses on
religion from the shopboard, and researches into philosophy from behind
the counter. When you took notice of the want of learning in our peo∣ple of
quality, you ought in justice to have acknowledged the amazing erudition of
our tradesmen. The Plebeians of <HI>Rome</HI> were mere brutes to our common
people; and I am of opinion that the public room under that in which this
weekly meeting is held, instead of being furnished with the busts of our
<HI>English</HI> poets, should be adorned with the heads of the learned
shoemakers, tallow-chandlers, ba∣kers, &amp;c. that constitute this
excellent Society.</P>
<P>WE may venture to say that the Royal Society and the
<HI>Robin Hood</HI> Society are the two greatest ornaments of this nation:
and as the former now and then give us an account of their transactions, it
were to be wished that the fellows <PB N="209" REF="214"/> of the latter would
also from time to time oblige us with an history of their proceedings. We
should then see by what means so many proselytes have been made from
bigotry and superstition; by what degrees a young disputant from a raw
Christian ripens into a deist, from a deist into a freethinker, and from
a freethinker (by a very short step) into an atheist. We should also
know the effect, that the disputations at this weekly meeting has upon our
lives and conversations; and from thence judge how much a design of this
nature deserves public encouragement. I have here flung together a short
account of some of the former members, and upon a review of it cannot but
lament that it seems to be the peculiar fate of great orators, such as
<HI>Demosthenes</HI> and <HI>Tully</HI> for example, to come to an unhappy
end.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="body of issue">
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> HAVE somewhere seen a print representing a man and
woman of every nation in the world drest according to the mode of their
respective countries. I could not help re∣flecting at the time, that the
fashions, which prevail in <HI>England</HI> in the space of a century,
would enable any of our painters to fill a picture with as great a variety of
habits; and that an <HI>Englishman</HI> or <HI>Englishwoman</HI> in one
part of the piece would no more resemble an <HI>Englishman</HI> or
<HI>Englishwoman</HI> in the other, than a <HI>Frenchman</HI> does a
<HI>Chinese.</HI> Very extraordinary revolutions have already hap∣pened in
the habits of this kingdom; and as dress is sub∣ject to unaccountable
changes, posterity may perhaps see without surprize our ladies strut
about in breeches, while our men waddle in hoop-petticoats.</P>
<P><PB N="212" REF="217"/>IN the days of queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> it
was the fashion for the ladies to conceal and wrap up as much of their bodies
as they could: their necks were encompassed with a broad ruff, which
likewise spread itself over their bosoms; and their sleeves were
continued down and fastened close to their wrists, while only their feet
were allowed just to peep from beneath the modest fardingale; so that
nothing was exposed to the impertinent eye of man but their faces. Our
mo∣dern ladies have run into the direct contrary extreme, and appear like so
many rope-dancers: they have discarded as much of their cloaths as with any
tolerable decency can be thrown off, and may be said (like the
<HI>Indian)</HI> to be all face: the neck and bosom are laid bare, and
disentangled from the invidious vail of an handkerchief; the stays are
sunk half way down the waist, and the petticoat has risen in the same
proportion from the ancle. Nor is the lover only captivated by the naked charms
which meet his sight before; but our ladies, like the <HI>Parthians,</HI>
have also learned the art of wounding from behind, and attract our attention
no less by laying their shoulders open to the view, which (as a young
physician of my acquaintance once observed) makes them look as if they were
prepared to receive a blister. A Naked Lady is no longer the admiration only
of a masque∣rade: every public assembly will furnish us with
<HI>Iphigenias</HI> undrest for the sacrifice; and if the next summer
should prove an hot one, our ladies will perhaps improve on the thin
vesture of the <HI>Spartan</HI> virgins, and appear abroad in nothing but a
lawn shade and gause petticoat. If the men should take the hint from the
other sex, and begin to strip in their turn, I tremble to think what may be
the conse∣quence: for if they go on in proportion with the women, we may
soon expect to see our fine gentlemen, like the Highlanders, without
breeches.</P>
<P><PB N="213" REF="218"/>IT would be endless to trace the
strange revolutions that have happened in every part of the female dress
within these few years. The hoop has been known to expand and contract
itself from the size of a butter churn to the cir∣cumference of three
hogsheads; at one time it was sloped from the waist in a pyramidical
form; at another it was bent upwards like an inverted bow, by which the two
angles, when squeezed up on each side, came in contact with the ears. At
present it is nearly of an oval form, and scarce measures from end to end
above twice the length of the wearer. The hoop has at present lost much of
its credit in the female world, and has suffered much from the innova∣tion of
short sacks and negligées, which it must be con∣fessed are
equally becoming to the lady of pleasure and the lady of quality: for as the
men will agree, that next to no cloaths at all nothing is more ravishing than
an easy disha∣bille, our ladies for that reason perhaps come into public
places, as if they were just got out of bed, or as if they were ready to go
into it. This, while it is the fashion, must be agreeable; but I must own
that I could sooner approve of their encirling themselves in so many ells
of whalebone, than to see them affect to appear with their cloaths huddled on
so loosely and indecently. This manner of dressing, or rather not
dressing, was brought from <HI>Paris:</HI> but I would have my fair readers
consider, that as this loose method of dress is calculated to hide any
defects in the body, it is very impolitic to suffer all that symmetry and
elegant turn of shape they are mistresses of, to be smothered under
it; since these habits can be of no more service to their persons, than
paint (that other <HI>Paris</HI> commodity) can add to the natural red and
white of their complexion, though perhaps it may heighten the sallow
visages of the <HI>French.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="214" REF="219"/>BUT of all the branches of female dress
none has un∣dergone more alterations than that of the head. The long lappets,
the horse-shoe cap, the <HI>Brussels</HI> head, and the pru∣dish mob
pinned under the chin, have all of them had their day. The present mode has
rooted out all these superfluous excrescences, and in the room of a
slip of cambrick or lace has planted a whimsical sprig of spangles or
artificial flow∣rets. We may remember, when for a while the hair was tortured
into ringlets behind: at present it is braided into a <HI>queüe,</HI>
(like those formerly worn by the men, and still re∣taining the original
name of <HI>Ramillies,)</HI> which, if it were not reverted upwards, would make
us imagine that our fine ladies were afflicted with the <HI>Plica
Polonica.</HI></P>
<P>IF the caps have passed through many metamorphoses, no
less a change has been brought about in the other cover∣ings contrived for
the head. The diminitive high-crowned hat, the bonnet, the hive, and the
milkmaid's chip hat, were rescued for a time from old women and servant
girls, to adorn heads of the first fashion: nor was the method of cocking;
hats less fluctuating, till they were at length settled to the present
mode; by which it is ordered that every hat, whether of straw or silk,
whether of the chambermaid or the mistress, must have their flaps turned
up perpendicu∣larly both before and behind. If the end of a fine lady's dress
was not rather ornamental than useful, we should think it a little odd that
hats, which seem naturally intended to screen their faces from the heat or
severity of the weather, should be moulded into a shape that prevents
their answer∣ing either of these purposes: but we must indeed allow it
to be highly ornamental, as the present hats worn by the women are more bold
and impudent than the broad-brimmed staring <HI>Kavenhullers</HI> worn a few
years ago by <PB N="215" REF="220"/> the men. These hats are also decorated
with two waving pendants of ribband, hanging down from the brim on the left
side. I am not so much offended at the flaming air which these
streamers carry with them, as I am afraid lest it should spoil the
charming eyes of my pretty country∣women, which are constantly provoked to
cast a glance at them; and I have myself often observed, an obliging ogle
or ravishing leer intercepted by these mediums, so that when a lady has
intended to charm her lover, she has shocked him with an hideous
squint.</P>
<P>THE ladies have long been severely rallied on their too great
attention to finery: but to own the truth dress seems at present to be as
much the study of the male part of the world as the female. We have
gentlemen, who 
<Q REND="inline">"will lay a whole night (as <HI>Benedick</HI>
says) carving the fashion of a new doublet:"</Q> they have their toilettes
too, as well as the ladies, set out with washes, perfumes and cosmetics,
and will spend the whole morning in dressing their hair, scenting their
linnen, and arching their eyebrows. Their heads (as well as the ladies) have
undergone various muta∣tions, and have worn as many different kinds of wigs, as
the block at their barbers. About fifty years ago they buried their heads in a
bush of hair; and the beaux (as <HI>Swift</HI> says) lay hid beneath the
penthouse of a full-bottomed perriwig. But as they then shewed nothing but
the nose, mouth and eyes, the fine gentlemen of our time not only oblige us
with their full faces, but have drawn back the side curls quite to the tip of
the ear.</P>
<P>AS <HI>France</HI> appears to be the wardrobe of the world, I
shall conclude my paper with a piece of secret history, which gives us
some insight into the origin of deriving all our fashions from
thence.—The celebrated Lord <HI>Foppington</HI> among his other amours
had once an intrigue with a milliner <PB N="216" REF="221"/> of
<HI>Covent-Garden,</HI> who after some time brought a lovely girl into the
world, and called her after his lordship's sir∣name, FASHION. The milliner
brought up the child in her own house till the age of fifteen, at which time
she grew very pressing with Lord <HI>Foppington</HI> to make some
provision for his daughter. My lord, who was never much pleased with this
consequence of his amours, that he might be rid of the girl for ever, put her
into the hands of a friend, who was going abroad, to place her in a nunnery:
but the girl, who had very little of the vestal in her disposition,
contrived to escape from her conductor, and fly to <HI>Paris.</HI> There her
beauty and sprightliness soon secured her many friends; and she
opened a genteel shop in her mother's business. She soon made herself
remarkable for contriving the most ele∣gant head-dresses, and cutting out
ruffles with the most ra∣vishing slope: her fancy was besides so
inexhaustible, that she almost every day produced a great variety of new
and beautiful patterns. She had many adorers, and at last mar∣ried his Most
Christian Majesty's taylor. This alliance brought the dress of all
<HI>Paris</HI> under their jurisdiction; and the young lady, out of a natural
love to her native country, proposed the extending their care to the fine
gentlemen and ladies of <HI>London.</HI> In pursuance of this
<HI>Monsieur</HI> her husband, two or three times in the year, sends over
a suit of cloaths entirely <HI>à la Paris</HI> as a pattern to
<HI>Messieurs Regnier</HI> and <HI>Lynch</HI> of <HI>Leicester
Fields</HI> and <HI>Pall Mall,</HI> while his wife sends over a little wooden
<HI>Mademoiselle</HI> to her relations in <HI>Tavistock Street.</HI></P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG> CORRESPONDENT writes to me, that after having considered
the Art of Speaking in the Theatre, as also celebrated the practice of it in
the <HI>Robin Hood</HI> Society, my remarks will not be compleat, except I take
notice of the extraordinary eloquence of the <HI>Clare-Market</HI> Orator. He
desires me to remember, that this Universal Genius has from time to time
declared from his Rostrum with a thundering elocution,— 
<Q REND="inline">"that there is but one Orator in the world, and
He is the man—that Sir <HI>Robert Wal∣pole</HI> and all the great men in
the kingdom, have been His scholars—and that Bishops have come to His
Oratory to learn to preach."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="218" REF="223"/>I HAVE indeed observed with a good deal
of concern, that the Orator has of late discontinued to oblige the public
with his sunday evening lectures as usual. Instead of seeing his
Oratory-Chapel shut up, I was in hopes that every parish church in the
kingdom would be opened on the same prin∣ciples. How much more salutary
were His tenets, setting forth the sufficiency of Reason, than the cold
doctrine of our clergy preaching up the necessity of Faith! how superior
was his form of prayer to our whole liturgy, and how much better adapted to
particular occasions!— 
<Q REND="inline">"A prayer for a sinking bridge!—prayer
for the White Rose!— prayer for <HI>Jackson</HI>'s
Journal!—prayer for the heads on <HI>Temple-Bar!</HI>"</Q>—In
these pious addresses he would first invoke the Supreme Being in the
most solemn manner; then suddenly slide into the familiar, and
pray,— 
<Q REND="inline">"that we might not hear the croaking of
<HI>Dutch Nightingales</HI> in the king's chambers;"</Q>—or on another
occasion, 
<Q REND="inline">"that our clergy might not study
<HI>Shakespear</HI> more than the Gospel, and that they might be rather
employed on the Evange∣lists, than <HI>As you like it,</HI> or <HI>Much ado
about nothing.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>I CANNOT but likewise lament the loss of the entertain∣ment,
which his Advertisements used to give us every Sa∣turday in the
news-papers. The terms in which they were commonly expressed were clear and
elegant, and furnished the reader with an admirable idea of the Doctor's
manner from the pulpit. For instance, when he told you his text was from
<HI>Isaiah,</HI> and quoted these words— 
<Q REND="inline">"<HI>Strt!</HI> 10 <HI>Jun! No Hnvr! Down with
the Rmp!</HI>"</Q>—we might form a tolerable judgement of the great
reverence he paid the Bible; and when he called his Assembly— 
<Q REND="inline">"<HI>The</HI> ORATORY—P. <HI>Charles's
Chapel</HI>"</Q>—we might guess at his loyalty and patriotism.
These were the advantages, which we derived <PB N="219" REF="224"/> from his
Chapel; and if the Oratory remains shut, I shall begin to fear that things
will continue in their present shocking state; and that the Scheme lately
proposed in one of my papers <HI>for abolishing Christianity</HI> will
not take effect; at which I am more particularly concerned, as it will hinder
the advancement of this great man. For if such a revolution should happen
in the church, the Ora∣tor's principles would be found so entirely
fundamental, that he would probably then hold some honourable station equal
to our present Archbishop of <HI>Canterbury.</HI></P>
<P>THE public for these reasons will doubtless join with me
in a petition, that this illustrious Divine would again resume his
station in the pulpit: at least I could wish, that some able
Theologist, who has been long practised in de∣ciding on the most
abstruse points of religion in the <HI>Robin Hood</HI> Society, may be
deputed in the absence of the Orator to officiate as his curate. I would
also re∣commend it to the above-mentioned Society to attend these lectures
regularly; from, whence they may gather stronger arguments for their
disputations, than from reading <HI>Collins, Chubb, Tindal, Bolingbroke,</HI>
or any other orthodox free∣thinker whatever. Upon the whole I cannot conclude
without observing, that such is the ingratitude of the age, that the
singular merits of our Orator are not sufficiently regarded. He is indeed
deservedly caressed by the Butchers of <HI>Clare-Market:</HI> but had our
Orator been born at <HI>Athens</HI> or <HI>Rome,</HI> he would certainly have
been deified as the God of Butchers, have been worshipped like
<HI>Isis</HI> under the figure of a Calf, or have had a statue erected to
him in the <HI>Fo∣rum</HI> or <HI>Market</HI>-place among the Shambles.</P>
<P>THUS much I thought myself bound to say in praise of the
Orator and Oratory; as he has some time ago done <PB N="220" REF="225"/> me
the honour of a letter, which I am very glad of this opportunity to communicate
to my readers. The private epistles of <HI>Tully</HI> are very unequal to his
Orations: but the following letter is in the very stile and spirit of our
Ora∣tor's animated discourses from the pulpit. I shall there∣fore
present it to the public exactly as I received it, with∣out presuming to
alter or suppress the least syllable: and for the further

<P>I WOULD have you to know, that the person as sent you the
account of our Club did not do right. He repre∣sents us all as a pack of
tradesmen and mechanics, and would have you to think as how there are no
gentlemen among us. But that is not the case: I am a gentleman, and we have a
great many topping people besides. Though Mr. President is but a baker, and
we have a shoemaker, and some other handicraftsmen, that come to talk;
yet I can assure you they know as much of religion and the good of their
country, (and other such matters,) as any of we gentle∣men. But as I said
we have a good many topping folks besides myself: for there is not a night
but we have several young lawyers and councellors, and doctors, and
surgeons, and captains, and poets, and players, and a great many Irish∣men
and Scotchmen (very fine speakers) who follow no busi∣ness; besides
several foreigners, who are all of them great men in their own country. And
we have one squire, who lives at t'other end of the town, and always comes in
his chariot.</P>
<P><PB N="222" REF="227"/>AND so as I said we have a good many
tip-top people, as can talk as well as any of your play-folks or parsons: and
as for my part every body knows that I am a lord's gentleman, and never was the
man that wore a livery in my life. I have been of the Club more or less off
and on for these six years, and never let a question pass me, Mr.
President knows it: and though I say it that should not say it, I can
talk (and so can any of our Club) as well as the best of you poets can
write. And so as I said I expect you will put it in your paper, that we
have a great many gentlemen in our Club besides myself.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>T a certain coffee-house near the <HI>Temple</HI> the bar is
kept by a pretty coquet, a piece of furniture almost as necessary for a
coffee-room in that situation as the news papers. This lady, you may be
sure, has many admirers, who are now and then glad of an opportunity to
relieve themselves from the severe study of the law by a soft
conversation with this fair one, and repeating on the occasion all the
tender things they can remember from plays, or whatever else <HI>Orgeat</HI>
or <HI>Cappillaire</HI> can inspire. Among the many pretenders to her favour
there is one faithful swain, who has long entertained a serious passion
for her. This tender-hearted gentleman, who is grown so lean with living upon
love, that one would imagine 
<Q REND="inline">"the blasts of <HI>January</HI> 
<PB N="224" REF="229"/> would blow him through and through,"</Q> comes every
evening, and sits whole hours by the bar, gazing at his mistress, and
taking in large draughts of love and Hyson tea. Never was swain in such
cruel circumstances. He is forced to bear with patience all the haughty
insolence of this goddess of bread and butter; who, as she knows him in
her power, keeps him at a distance, though she behaves with the pertest
familiarity to the other coxcombs, who are continually buzzing about her. At
eleven he sneaks off pale and discontented; but cannot forbear coming again
the next evening, though he knows how vilely he shall be used by his
mistress, and that he is laughed at even by the waiters.</P>
<P>IF all true lovers were obliged, like this unhappy gen∣tleman,
to carry on their courtships in public, we should be witness to many
scenes equally ridiculous. Their aukward desire of pleasing influences
every trivial gesture, and when once love has got possession of a
man's heart, it shews itself down to the tips of his fingers. The
conversation of a lan∣guishing <HI>inamorato</HI> is made up chiefly of
dumb signs, such as sighs, ogles, or glances: but if he offers to break
his passion to his mistress, there is such a stammering, faultering
and half-wording the matter, that the language of love, so much talked of by
poets, is in truth no language at all. Whoever should break in upon a
gentleman and lady, while so critical a conversation is going forward,
would not forbear laughing at such an extraordinary <HI>téte á
téte,</HI> and would perhaps cry out with <HI>Ranger,</HI> that 
<Q REND="inline">"nothing looks so silly as a pair of your
true lovers."</Q></P>
<P>SINCE true and sincere love is sure to make it's votaries
thus ridiculous, we cannot sufficiently commend our pre∣sent people of
quality, who have made such laudable at∣tempts to deliver themselves and
posterity from its bondage. <PB N="225" REF="230"/> In a fashionable wedding
the man or woman are neither of them considered as reasonable creatures,
who come together in order to 
<Q REND="inline">"comfort, love, cherish, honour or obey,"</Q>
according to their respective duties, but are regarded merely as
instruments of joining one estate to another. Acre marries acre; and to
increase and multiply their fortunes is in genteel matches the chief
consideration of man and wife. The courtship is carried on by the council
of each party, and they pay their addresses by billet-deux upon parchment.
The great convenience of expelling love from matrimony is very evident: Married
persons of quality are never troubled with each others company abroad, or
fatigued with dull matrimonial discourses at home: My lord keeps his girl,
my lady has her gallant; and they both enjoy all the fashionable privileges
of wed∣lock without the inconveniences. This would never be the case, if
there was the least spark of love subsisting between them, but they
must be reduced to the same situation with those wretches, who (as they
have nothing to settle on each other but themselves) are obliged to make up
the deficiencies of fortune by affection. But while these miserable, fond,
doating, unfashionable cou∣ples are obliged to content themselves with love
and a cottage, people of quality enjoy the comforts of indiffe∣rence and a
coach and six.</P>
<P>THE late Marriage Act is excellently adapted to pro∣mote this
prudential proceeding with respect to wedlock. It will in time inevitably
abolish the old system of found∣ing matrimony on affection; and marrying
for love will be given up for the sake of marrying according to Act of
Parliament. There is now no danger of an handsome worthy young fellow of
small fortune running away with an heiress; for it is not sufficient to
insinuate himself into <PB N="226" REF="231"/> the lady's favour by a
voluble tongue and a good per∣son, unless he can also subdue the
considerate parents or guardians by the merits of his rent-roll. As this Act
promotes the method of disposing of children by way of bargain and sale,
it consequently puts an end to that ridiculous courtship, arising from
simple love. In order therefore to confirm (as far as possible) the happy
con∣sequences of this act, I have been long endeavouring to hit on some
expedient, by which all the circumstances preparatory to wedlock may be
carried on in a proper manner. A <HI>Smithfield</HI> bargain being so common
in me∣taphor, I had once some thoughts of proposing to realize it, and had
almost completed a plan, by which all the young persons (like servant
girls at a statute-fair in the country) were to be brought to market, and
disposed of in one part of <HI>Smithfield,</HI> while the sheep and
horses were on sale in another.</P>
<P>IN the midst of these serious considerations I received
a scheme of this nature from my good friend Mr. KEITH, whose chapel the
late Marriage Act has rendered useless on its original principles. This
reverend gentleman, see∣ing that all husbands and wives are henceforward to
be put up to sale, proposes shortly to open his chapel on a more new and
fashionable plan. As the ingenious Messieurs <HI>Henson</HI> and
<HI>Bever</HI> have lately opened in different quarters of the town
Repositories for all horses to be sold by auction; Mr. KEITH intends
setting up a Repository for all young males and females to be disposed
of in marriage. From these studs (as the Doctor himself expresses it)
a lady of beauty may be coupled to a man of fortune, and an old gentleman, who
has a colt's tooth remaining, may match himself with a tight young filly.</P>
<P><PB N="227" REF="232"/>THE Doctor makes no doubt but his Chapel
will turn out even more to his advantage on this new plan than on it's first
institution, provided he can secure his scheme to him∣self, and reap
the benefits of it without interlopers from the <HI>Fleet.</HI> To prevent his
design being pirated, he intends peti∣tioning the Parliament, that as he has
been so great a sufferer by the Marriage Act, the sole right of opening a
Repository of this sort may be vested in him, and that his place of
resi∣dence in May Fair may still continue the grand mart for marriages. Of
the first day of sale proper notice will be given in the public papers, and
in the mean time I am desired to communicate the following specimen to my
readers.</P>

<LETTER>
<HEAD>To Mr. TOWN.</HEAD>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>S I was passing the other night through a narrow little
lane in the skirts of the city, I was stopped by a grand procession of
a hearse and three mourning-coaches drawn by six horses, accompanied with
a great number of flambeaus and attendants in black. I naturally concluded,
that all this parade was em∣ployed to pay the last honours to some eminent
person, whose consequence in life required that his ashes should
re∣ceive all the respect which his friends and relations could pay to them:
but I could not help smiling, when upon en∣quiry I was told, that the
corpse (on whom all this expence had been lavished) was no other than
<HI>Tom Taster</HI> the cheesemonger, who had lain in state all the week
at his <PB N="230" REF="235"/> house in <HI>Thames-street,</HI> and was
going to be deposited with his ancestors in <HI>White-chapel</HI>
burying-ground. This illustrious personage was, I believe, the first of
his family, that ever thought of riding in a coach, living or dead: he was the
son of a butcher in <HI>White-chapel,</HI> and died indeed but in
in∣different circumstances: his widow however, for the ho∣nour of
<HI>her</HI> family, was resolved at all events to <HI>bury him
handsomely.</HI></P>
<P>YOU have already, Mr. <HI>TOWN,</HI> taken notice of that
ridiculous affectation among the middling sort of people, which induces them
to make a figure beyond their circum∣stances: I could wish that you would
also expose this equally absurd vanity, which extends to the dust, and
by which the dead are made accessory in robbing the living. I have
fre∣quently known a greater sum expended at the funeral of a tradesman,
than would have kept his whole family for a twelvemonth; and it has more than
once happened, that the next heir has been flung into gaol for not being able
to pay the undertaker's bill.</P>
<P>THIS absurd notion of being <HI>handsomely buried</HI> has
given rise to the most contradictory customs, that could possibly be
contrived for the advantage of death-hunters. As funerals are at present
conducted, all distinction is lost among us; and there is no more
difference between the duke and the dancing-master in the manner of their
burial, than is to be found between their dust in the grave. It is easy to
account for the introduction of the hearse and mourning-coach in our funeral
ceremonies, though their propriety is entirely destroyed by the promiscuous
use of them. Our ancient and noble families may be supposed to have
particular family-vaults near their mansion-houses in the country, and in
which their progenitors have been deposited for ages. It is therefore very
natural that persons of distinction, who had been used to be conveyed to
their country-seats by a set of horses, should be also transported
to their graves by the same number; and be attended with the same
magnificence at their deaths, which they had been accustomed to in their
lives. The spirit of affecting the manners of the great has 
<PB N="231" REF="236"/> from hence made others vie (as far as they can) with
people of quality in the pomp of their burials: a tradesman, who has trudged
on foot all his life, shall be carried after death, scarce an hundred yards
from his house, with the equipage and retinue of a lord; and the plodding
cit, whose ambition never soared beyond the occasional one-horse-chair,
must be dragged to his long home by six horses. Such an ill-timed
ostentation of grandeur appears to me no less ridiculous than the vanity of
the highwayman, who sold his body to the surgeons, that he might hire a
mourning-coach, and go to the gallows like a gentleman.</P>
<P>THERE is another custom, which was doubtless first
in∣troduced by the great, but has been since adopted by others, who have not
the least title to it. The herald's office was originally instituted for
the distinction and preservation of gentility; and nobody is allowed to
bear a coat of arms, but what belongs to the family, and who is intitled to
that honourable badge. From this consideration we may account for the
practice of hanging the hearse round with escutcheons, on which the arms of
the deceased were blazoned, and which served to denote whose ashes it
conveyed. For the same purpose an atchievement was afterwards fixed over
the door of the late habitation of the deceased. This ensign of death may
fairly be indulged, where the persons are enno∣bled by their birth or
station, and where it serves to remind the passer-by of any great or
good actions performed by the deceased, or to inspire the living with an
emulation of their virtues. But why, forsooth, cannot an obscure or
insigni∣ficant creature go out of the world, without advertising it by the
atchievement? For my part, I generally consider it as a bill on an empty
house, which serves the widow to in∣form you, that the former tenant is
gone, and that another occupier is wanted in his room. Many families have
indeed been very much perplexed in making out their right to this mark of
gentility, and great profit has arisen to the herald's office by the
purchase of arms for this purpose. Many a worthy tradesman of
<HI>plebeian</HI> extraction has been made a gentleman after his decease by
the courtesy of his under∣taker; and I once knew a keeper of a tavern, who
not <PB N="232" REF="237"/> being able to give any account of his wife's
genealogy, put up his sign, the <HI>King</HI>'s <HI>Arms,</HI> for an
atchievement at her death.</P>
<P>IT was the custom, in the time of the plague, to fix a mark
on those houses, in which any one had died. This probably may have given
rise to the general fashion of hang∣ing up an atchievement. However this
be, it is now de∣signed as a polite token, that a death has happened in the
family, and might reasonably be understood as a warning to keep people from
intruding on their grief. No such thing is, indeed, intended by it: I am
therefore of opinion, that it ought every-where to be taken down after the
first week. Whatever outward signs of mourning may be preserved, no
regard is ever paid to them within: the same visitings, the same
card-playings, are carried on as before; and so little respect is shewn
to the atchievement, that if it happens (as it often does) to intersect one
of the windows in the grand apartment, it is occasionally re∣moved, whenever
the lady dowager has a route or drum-major.</P>
<P>THIS naturally leads me to consider how much 
<Q REND="inline">"the customary suits of solemn
black,"</Q> and the other 
<Q REND="inline">"trap∣pings and signs of woe,"</Q> are
become a mere farce and matter of form only. When a person of distinction
goes out of the world, not only the relations, but the whole household,
must be cloathed in sable. The kitchen-wench scours her dishes in
crape, and the helper in the stables rubs down his horses in black-leather
breeches. Every thing must put on a dismal appearance: even the coach
must be covered and lined with black. This last particular, it is
reasonable to imagine, is intended (like a death's head on the toilet) to put
the owner constantly in mind, that the pomp of the world and all gay
pursuits are but vain and perishable. Yet what is more common than for
these dismal vehicles to wait at the doors of the theatres, the
opera-house, and other public places of diversion? Those who are carried
in them are as little affected by their dismal appearance as the horses
that draw them; and I once saw <PB N="233" REF="238"/> with great surprize
an harlequin, a scaramouch, a shep∣herdess, and a black sattin devil,
get into a mourning coach to go to a jubilee masquerade.</P>
<P>IF I should not be thought to lay too much stress on the
lesser formalities observed in mourning, I might mention the admirable
method of qualifying the melancholy hue of the mourning ring, by enlivening it
with the brilliancy of a diamond. I knew a young lady, who wore on the same
finger a ring set round with death's heads and cross marrow bones for the
loss of her father, and another prettily em∣bellished with burning hearts
pierced through with darts, in respect to her lover. But what I most of all
admire is the odd contrivance, by which persons spread the tidings of the
death of their relations to the most distant parts, by the means of
black-edged paper and black sealing wax. If it were possible to inspect
the several letters that bear about them these external tokens of grief, I
believe we should hardly ever find the contents of the same gloomy
complexion: a luscious sonnet, or an amorous <HI>billet-doux,</HI> would be
much oftener found to be conveyed under these dismal passports, than
doleful ditties or reflections on mor∣tality: and indeed these mock signs
of woe are so little attended to, that a person opens one of these
letters with no more concern than is felt by the postman who brings it. Here
I must not forget mentioning the excellent fancy of a friend of mine, who has
greatly improved this ar∣ticle: ever since the death of his wife he has made
use of black sand, and writes with nothing but a crow-quill pen.</P>
<P>WE cannot suppose that black-edged paper was ever intended
to be defiled by vulgar hands, but contrived (like gilt paper) for the use of
the polite world only. But alas! we must always be aping the manners of our
betters! My agent sends me letters about business upon gilt paper; and a
stationer near the <HI>'Change</HI> tells me, that he not only sells a
great quantity of mourning paper to the citizens, but that he has lately
blacked the edges of <PB N="234" REF="239"/> the shop-books for several
tradesmen. You must have seen, Mr. <HI>TOWN,</HI> an elegant kind of
paper, imported from <HI>France</HI> for the use of our fine ladies and
gentlemen. An acquaintance of mine has contrived a new sort of mourning paper
on the same plan: and as the margin of the other is prettily adorned with
flowers, true lovers knots, little cupids, and amorous posies, in red ink; he
intends that the margin of his paper shall be dismally stamped in black
ink with the figures of tomb-stones, hour-glasses, bones, skulls, and
other emblems of death, to be used by persons of quality, when in
mourning.</P>

letter the enter∣tainment of to-day: I shall therefore only assure the
ingenious correspondent that fa∣voured me with it, that if it had not been
accidentally mislaid, it would not have remained so long unnoticed.</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>To Mr. TOWN.</HEAD>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR frequent ridicule of the several branches of Gaming has
given me great pleasure: I could only wish that you had completed the
design by drawing at large the portrait of a Gamester. This, since you
omitted it, I have ventured to undertake; and while your papers on this 
<PB N="236" REF="241"/> subject serve as a counter-treatise to that of
<HI>Hoyle</HI> on Whist, Back-gammon, &amp;c. my rough draught of the
professors of these arts may tend to illustrate the work, and stand
as pro∣perly in the frontispiece as the Knave of Clubs at the door of a
cardmaker.</P>
<P>THE whole tribe of Gamesters may be ranked under two
divisions: every man who makes carding, dicing, and bet∣ting his daily
practice is either a Dupe or a Sharper, two characters equally the objects of
envy and admiration. The Dupe is generally a person of great fortune and weak
intellects, 
<Q> 
<L>"Who will as tenderly be led by th' nose</L> 
<L>"As asses are."</L> 
<BIBL>SHAKESPEAR.</BIBL></Q> He plays, not that he has any
delight in cards or dice, but because it is the fashion; and if whist or
hazard are proposed, he will no more refuse to make one at the table, than
among a set of hard drinkers he would object drinking his glass in turn,
because he is not dry.</P>
<P>THERE are some few instances of men of sense, as well
as family and fortune, who have been dupes and bubbles. Such an unaccountable
itch of play has seized them that they have sacrificed every thing to it,
and have seemed wed∣ded to seven's the main, and the odd trick. There is
not a more melancholy object than a gentleman of sense thus infatuated. He
makes himself and family a prey to a gang of villains more infamous than
highwaymen; and perhaps when his ruin is completed, he is glad to join with the
very scoundrels that destroyed him, and live upon the spoils of others,
whom he can draw into the same follies that proved so fatal to
himself.</P>
<P>HERE we may take a survey of the character of a Shar∣per,
and that he may have no room to complain of foul <PB N="237" REF="242"/> play,
let us begin with his excellencies. You will perhaps be startled, Mr. TOWN,
when I mention the excellencies of a Sharper; but a Gamester who makes a
decent figure in the world, must be endued with many amiable qualities, which
would undoubtedly appear with great lustre, were they not eclipsed by the
odious character affixed to his trade. In order to carry on the common
business of his profession, he must be a man of quick and lively
parts, at∣tended with a Stoical calmness of temper, and a constant
presence of mind. He must smile at the loss of thousands, and is not
to be discomposed, though ruin stares him in the face. As he is to live
among the great, he must not want politeness and affability; he must be
submissive, but not servile; he must be master of an ingenuous
liberal air, and have a seeming openness of behaviour.</P>
<P>THESE must be the chief accomplishments of our Hero: but
lest I should be accused of giving too favourable a like∣ness of him,
now we have seen his outside, let us take a view of his heart. There we
shall find avarice the main spring that moves the whole machine. Every
Gamester is eaten up with avarice, and when this passion is in full
force, it is more strongly predominant than any other. It conquers even
lust; and conquers it more effectually than age. At sixty we look at a fine
woman with pleasure: but when cards and dice have engrossed our
attention, women and all their charms are slighted at five and twenty. A
thorough Gamester renounces <HI>Venus</HI> and <HI>Cupid</HI> for
<HI>Plutus</HI> and Ams∣ace, and owns no mistress of his heart except the
Queen of Trumps. His insatiable avarice can only be gratified by hypocrisy;
so that all those specious virtues already men∣tioned, and which, if
real, might be turned to the benefit of mankind, must be directed in a
Gamester towards the destruction of his fellow-creatures. His quick and
lively <PB N="238" REF="243"/> parts are only to instruct and assist him
in the most dextrous method of packing the cards and cogging the dice: his
for∣titude, which enables him to lose thousands without emotion, must
often be practised against the stings and reproaches of his own
conscience; and his liberal deportment and affected openness is only to
recommend and conceal the blackest villainy.</P>
<P>IT is now necessary to take a second survey of his
heart, and as we have seen it's vices let us consider it's miseries. The
covetous man who has not sufficient cou∣rage or inclination to encrease his
fortune by bets, cards, or dice, but is contented to hoard up his thousands
by thefts less public, or by cheats less liable to uncertainty, lives in a
state of perpetual suspicion and terror; but the avaritious fears of the
Gamester, are infinitely greater. He is constantly to wear a mask, and
like <HI>Monsieur St. Croix,</HI> coadjutor to that famous
<HI>empoisonneuse Madame Brinvillier,</HI> if his mask falls off, he runs
the hazard of being suffocated by the stench of his own poisons. I have
seen some ex∣amples of this sort, not many years ago at <HI>White</HI>'s.
I am uncertain whether the wretches are still alive, but if they are, they
breath like toads under ground, crawling amidst old walls, and paths long
since unfrequented.</P>
<P>BUT supposing that the Sharper's hypocrisy remains
undetected, in what a state of mind must that man be whose fortune
depends upon the insincerity of his heart, the disingenuity of his
behaviour, and the false biass of his dice? What sensations must he
suppress when he is obliged to smile, although he is provoked: when he
must look serene in the height of despair, and when he must act the
Stoic, without the consolation of one virtuous sentiment, or one moral
principle? How unhappy must he be even in <PB N="239" REF="244"/> that
situation, from which he hopes to reap most benefit? I mean, amidst
stars, garters, and the various herds of no∣bility? Their lordships are not
always in an humour for play: they chuse to laugh; they chuse to joke; in
the mean while our hero must patiently await the good hour, and must not
only join in the laugh, and applaud the jokes, but must humour every turn and
caprice, to which that set of spoiled children called bucks of quality are
liable. Surely his brother <HI>Thicket</HI>'s employment of sauntring on
horseback in the wind and rain till the <HI>Reading</HI> coach passes
through <HI>Smallberry-Green,</HI> is the more eligible, and no less
honest, occupation.</P>
<P>THE Sharper has also frequently the mortification of being
thwarted in his designs. Opportunities of fraud will not for ever present
themselves. The false die cannot be constantly produced, nor the packed
cards perpetually be placed upon the table. It is then our gamester is in the
greatest danger. But even then when he is in the power of fortune, and has
nothing but meer luck and fair play on his side, he must stand the brunt,
and perhaps give away his last guinea, as coolly as he would lend a nobleman
a shilling.</P>
<P>OUR hero is now going off the stage, and his catas∣trophe
is very tragical: the next news we hear of him is his death, atchieved by his
own hand, and with his own pistol. An inquest is bribed, he is buried at
midnight, and forgotten before sun-rise.</P>
<P>THESE two portraits of a Sharper, wherein I have en∣deavoured
to shew different likenesses in the same man, puts me in mind of an old
print, which I remember at <PB N="240" REF="245"/> <HI>Oxford,</HI> of Count
<HI>Guiscard.</HI> At first sight he was ex∣hibited in a full-bottom wig,
a hat and feather, embroi∣dered cloaths, diamond buttons, and the full
court-dress of those days: but by pulling a string, the folds of the
paper were shifted, the face only remained, a new body came forward, and
Count <HI>Guiscard</HI> appeared to be a DEVIL.</P>

<SALUTE>Dear <HI>Jack!</HI></SALUTE></OPENER>
<P> I WAS in hopes I should have met you at
<HI>Newmarket</HI> races, but to say the truth, if your luck had turned out
so bad as mine, you did better to stay away. <HI>Dick Riot, Tom
Lowngeit,</HI> and I went together to <HI>Newmarket</HI> the first day of the
meeting. I was mounted on my little bay-mare that cost me thirty guineas in
the North. I never crossed a better tit in my life, and if her eyes
stand, as I dare say they will, she will turn out as tight a little Thing
as any in <HI>England.</HI> Then she is as fleet as the wind. Why, I raced
with <HI>Dick</HI> and <HI>Tom</HI> all the way from <HI>Cambridge</HI> to
<HI>Newmarket: Dick</HI> rode his roan gelding, and <HI>Tom</HI> his chesnut
mare (which, you know, have both speed) but I beat them <HI>hollow.</HI> I
cannot help telling you that I was dressed in my blue riding-frock with
plate-buttons, with a leather belt round my waste, my jemmy turn-down boots
made by <HI>Tull,</HI> my brown scratch bob, and my hat with the
narrow-silver lace cocked in the true sporting taste: so that
altogether I don't believe there was a more <HI>knowing</HI> figure upon the
Course. I was very flush too, <HI>Jack</HI>; for <HI>Michaelmas-day</HI>
happening damned luckily just about the time of the races, I had just
received fifty guineas for my quarteridge. As soon as I came upon the
Course, I met with some jolly bucks from <HI>London.</HI> I never saw
them before; however we were soon acquainted, and I took up the Odds: but I
was damnably let in, for I lost thirty pieces slap the first day. The day
or two after I had no re∣markable <PB N="243" REF="248"/> luck one way or the
other; but at last I laid all the Cash I had left upon Lord
<HI>March</HI>'s <HI>Smart,</HI> who lost, you know, but between you and me,
I have a great notion <HI>Tom Marshall</HI> rode booty. However I had a mind
to push my luck as far as I could; so I sold my poor little mare for
twelve pieces, went to the coffee-house, and left them all behind me at the
gaming table; and I should not have been able to have got back to
<HI>Cambridge</HI> that night, if <HI>Bob Whip</HI> of <HI>Trinity</HI> had not
taken me up into his Phaeton. We have had a round of dinners at our rooms
since, and I have been drunk every day to drive away care. However I hope to
recruit again soon: <HI>Frank Classic</HI> of <HI>Pembroke</HI> has
promised to make me out a long catalogue of <HI>Greek</HI> books, so I will
write directly to Old Squaretoes, send him the list, tell him I have taken
them up, and draw on him for money to pay the bookseller's bill. Then I
shall be rich again, <HI>Jack</HI>; and perhaps you may see me at the
<HI>Shakespear</HI> by the middle of next week; till when, I am,</P>

</LETTER>
<P>I HAVE often lamented the narrow plan of our Univer∣sity
Education, and always observe with pleasure any at∣tempts to enlarge and
improve it. In this light I cannot help looking on <HI>Newmarket</HI> as a
judicious supplement to the University of <HI>Cambridge,</HI> and would
recommend it to the young students to repair duly thither twice a year. By
these means they may connect the knowledge of polite life with study, and
come from college as deeply versed in the genteel mysteries of Gaming, as
in <HI>Greek, Latin,</HI> and the Mathematicks. Attending these solemnities
must indeed be of great service to every rank of students. Those who
are <PB N="244" REF="249"/> intended for the Church have an opportunity of
tempering the severity of their character by a happy mixture of the jockey
and clergyman. I have known several who by uni∣ting these opposite
qualifications, and meeting with a patron of their own disposition, have
rode themselves into a living in a good sporting country; and I doubt not,
if the excursions of gownsmen to <HI>Newmarket</HI> meet with the
encouragement they deserve, but we shall shortly see the Beacon
Course crouded with ordained sportsmen in short cassocks. As to the
Fellow-Commoners, I do not see how they can pass their time more
profitably. The sole intention of their residence at the University is,
with most of them, to while away a couple of years, which they cannot
conveniently dispose of otherwise. Their rank exempts them from the
common drudgery of lectures and exercises, and the Golden Tuft that adorns
their velvet caps is at once a badge of ho∣nour and an apology for ignorance.
But as some of these gentlemen, though they never will be scholars, may
turn out excellent jockeys, it is but justice to let them carry some kind
of knowledge away with them; and as they can never shine as adepts in Sir
<HI>Isaac Newton</HI>'s Philosophy, or critics on <HI>Homer</HI> and
<HI>Virgil,</HI> suffer them to make a figure as arbiters of the Course,
and followers of <HI>Aaron</HI> and <HI>Driver.</HI></P>
<P>I AM the more earnest on this occasion, because I look
upon Races as a diversion, peculiarly adapted to an Univer∣sity, and
founded upon classical principles. Every author who has mentioned the
Antient Games, includes the Race, and describes it with great dignity. This
Game was always celebrated with great pomp, and all the <HI>people of
fashion</HI> of those days were present at it. In the twenty third
<HI>Iliad</HI> in particular there is not only a dispute at the Race, but a
bet proposed in as express terms as at <HI>Newmarket.</HI> The wager 
<PB N="245" REF="250"/> offered indeed is a goblet, which is not entirely in the
man∣ner of our modern sportsmen, who rather chuse to melt down their
plate into the current specie, and bring their side∣boards to the course
in their purses. I am aware also that the Races celebrated by the ancients
were Chariot-Races: but even in these our young students of the
University have great emulation to excell: There are among them many very
good coachmen who often make excursions in those noble vehicles with great
propriety called <HI>Phaetons,</HI> and drive with as much fury along the road,
as the charioteers in the An∣tient Game flew towards the goal. In a word, if we
have not such noble Odes on this occasion as were produced of old, it is
not for want of a <HI>Theron</HI> but a <HI>Pindar.</HI></P>
<P>THE Advices which I have at several times received of the
influence of the Races at <HI>Newmarket</HI> on the University give me great
pleasure. It has not only improved the beha∣viour of the students but
enlarged their plan of study. They are now very deeply read in
<HI>Bracken</HI>'s <HI>Farriery</HI> and the <HI>Compleat Jockey,</HI> know
exactly how many stone they weigh, and are pretty competent judges of the
Odds. I went some time ago to visit a fellow-commoner, and when I arrived
at his chambers, found the door open, but my friend was not at home. The room
was adorned with <HI>Seymour</HI>'s prints of horses neatly framed and
glazed, a hat and whip hung on one hook, a pair of boots on another, and on the
table lay a formidable Quarto with the <HI>Sportsman</HI>'s <HI>Calendar</HI>
by <HI>Reginald Heber,</HI> Esq<SUP>r</SUP>. I had the curiosity to examine the book,
and as the college is remarkable for the study of philosophy, I expected to
see <HI>Newton</HI>'s <HI>Principia,</HI> or perhaps <HI>Sanderson</HI>'s
<HI>Algebra:</HI> but on opening it, this huge volume proved to be a pompous
edition of <HI>Gibson</HI>'s <HI>Treatise on the Diseases of
Horses.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="246" REF="251"/>THESE indeed are noble studies, will
preserve our youth from pedantry, and make them men of the world. Men of
genius who are pleased with the theory of any art, will not be contented
'till they arrive at the practice. I am told that the young gentlemen often try
the speed of the <HI>Cam∣bridge</HI> Nags on the Beacon Course, and that
several hacks are at present in training. I have often wondered that the
gentlemen who form the club at <HI>Newmarket</HI> never reflected on their
neighbourhood to <HI>Cambridge,</HI> nor established (in honour of it) an
University Plate, to be run for by <HI>Camsbrige</HI> hacks, rode by young
gentlemen of the University. A hint of this kind will certainly be
sufficient to have this laudable design put in practice the very next
meeting; and I can∣not help reflecting on this occasion, what an
unspeakable satisfaction it must be to those persons of quality who
are constantly at <HI>Newmarket,</HI> to see their sons cherish the
same noble principles with themselves, and act in imitation of their
example.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG> FRIEND of mine lately gave me an account of a set of
gentlemen, who meet together once a week under the name of <HI>The</HI> ENGLISH
CLUB. The title with which they dignify their Society arises from the chief
end of their meeting, which is to cultivate their Mother Tongue. They employ
half the time of their assembling in hearing some of our best
Classics read to them, which generally furnishes them with conversation
for the rest of the even∣ing. They have instituted annual festivals in
honour of <HI>Spenser, Shakespear, Milton,</HI> &amp;c. on each of which an
oration, interspersed with encomiums on the <HI>English</HI> lan∣guage,
is spoken in praise of the author, who, in the phrase 
<PB N="248" REF="253"/> of the almanack, gives the red letter to the day. They
have also established a fund, from which handsome rewards are allotted
to those who shall supply the place of any exotic terms that have been
smuggled into our language by homespun <HI>British</HI> words equally
significant and expres∣sive. An order is also made against importing
any contra∣band phrases into the Club, by which heavy fines are laid on
those who shall have any modish barbarisms found upon them: whether
they be foreign words, antient or modern, or any cant terms coined by <HI>The
Town</HI> for the service of the current year.</P>
<P>THE whole account which I received from my friend gave me great
satisfaction: and I never remember any society that met together on such
commendable principles. Their proceedings it must however be confessed
are somewhat unfashionable; for the <HI>English</HI> Tongue is become as
little the general care as <HI>English</HI> Beef, or <HI>English</HI>
Honesty. Young gentlemen are obliged to drudge at school for nine or ten
years in order to scrape together as much <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Latin</HI>
as they can forget during their tour abroad, and have com∣monly at the same
time a private master to give them <HI>French</HI> enough to land them with
some reputation at <HI>Calais.</HI> This is to be sure very prudent as well
as genteel. Yet some people are perverse enough to imagine that to teach
boys a foreign language, living or dead, without at the same time grounding
them in their Mother Tongue is a very prepos∣terous plan of education. The
<HI>Romans,</HI> though they studied at <HI>Athens,</HI> directed their
studies to the benefit of their own country, and though they read
<HI>Greek,</HI> wrote in <HI>Latin.</HI> There are at this day in
<HI>France</HI> Academies esta∣blished for the support and preservation
of the <HI>French</HI> lan∣guage: and perhaps, if to the present
Professorships of <HI>He∣brew</HI> and <HI>Greek,</HI> there should be
added a Professorship of the <PB N="249" REF="254"/> <HI>English</HI>
language, it would be no disgrace to our learned Universities.</P>
<P>WHEN we consider that our language is preferable to most if
not all others now in being, it seems something extraordinary that any
attention should be paid to a foreign Tongue that is refused to our own,
when we are likely to get so little by the exchange. But when we reflect
further on the remarkable purity to which some late authors have brought it,
we are still more concerned at the present neglect of it. This shameful
neglect I take to be owing chiefly to these two reasons, the false pride
of those who are esteemed men of learning, and the ridiculous affectation
of our fine gentlemen, and pretenders to wit.</P>
<P>IN complaisance to our fine gentlemen, who are them∣selves
the allowed standards of politeness, I shall begin with them first.
Their conversation exactly answers the descrip∣tion which
<HI>Benedick</HI> gives of <HI>Claudio</HI>'s: 
<Q REND="inline">"their words are a very fantastical banquet,
just so many strange dishes."</Q> These dishes too are all
<HI>French</HI>; and I do not know whether their conversation does not a good
deal depend on their bill of fare, and whether the thin meagre diet, on which
our sine gentlemen subsist, does not in some measure take away the
power of that bold articulation necessary to give utterance to manly
<HI>British</HI> accents: whence their conversa∣tion becomes so 
<Q REND="inline">"fantastical a banquet,"</Q> and every
sentence they deliver almost as heterogeneous a mixture as a salma∣gundy.
A fashionable coxcomb now never complains of the vapours, but tells you that
he is very much <HI>ennuyèe.</HI>—He does not affect to be genteel
but <HI>degagèe</HI>—nor is he taken with an elegant simplicity
in a beautiful countenance, but breaks out in raptures on a <HI>je
ne-scay-quoi,</HI> and a certain <HI>naivetè.</HI> In a word, his head
as well as his heels is en∣tirely <PB N="250" REF="255"/> <HI>French,</HI> and
he is a thorough <HI>petit maitre</HI> in his lan∣guage as well as behaviour.
But notwithstanding ail this, I do not know whether the conversation of our
pretenders to wit is not still more barbarous. When they talk of
<HI>Humbug,</HI> &amp;c. they seem to be jabbering in the uncouth dialect of
the <HI>Huns,</HI> or the rude gabble of the <HI>Hottentots:</HI> or if their
words are at all allied to the language of this country, it probably comes
nearest to the strange cant said to be in use among housebreakers and
highwaymen; and if their jargon will bear any explanation, the curious are
most likely to meet with it in a polite vocabulary lately pub∣lished under
the title of the <HI>Scoundrel's Dictionary.</HI></P>
<P>MANY who are accounted men of learning, if they do not join with
fops and coxcombs to corrupt our language, at least do very little to promote
it, and are sometimes very indifferently acquainted with it. There are many
persons of both our Universities who can decypher an old <HI>Greek</HI>
manuscript, and construe <HI>Lycophron extempore,</HI> who scarce know
the idiom of their own language, and are at a loss how to dispatch a
familiar letter with tolerable facility. These gentlemen seem to think that
learning consists merely in being versed in languages not generally
understood. But it should be considered, that the same Genius which
animated the Ancients has dispensed at least some portion of it's heat
to later ages, and particularly to the <HI>English.</HI> Those who are
really charmed with <HI>Homer</HI> and <HI>Sophocles</HI> will hardly read
<HI>Shakespear</HI> and <HI>Milton</HI> without emotion, and if I was
in∣clined to carry on the parallel, I could perhaps mention as many great names
as <HI>Athens</HI> ever produced. 
<Q> 
<L>Multa poetarum veniet manus, auxilio quae</L> 
<L>Sit mihi.—</L> 
<BIBL>HOR.</BIBL></Q> The knowledge of <HI>Greek, Latin,</HI>
&amp;c. is certainly very <PB N="251" REF="256"/> valuable, but this may be
attained without the loss of their Mother Tongue: for these reverend
gentlemen should know that languages are not like preferments in the Church,
too many of which cannot be held together.</P>
<P>THIS great neglect of our own Tongue is one of the principal
reasons that we are so seldom favoured with any publications from either
of our Universities, which we might expect very often in consideration of
the great number of learned men who reside there. The press being thus
desert∣ed by those who might naturally be expected to support it, falls
to the care of a set of illiterate hirelings, in whose hands it is no
wonder if the language is every day mangled, and should at last be utterly
destroyed. Writing is well known to be at present as much a trade as any
handicraft whatever, and every man who can vamp up any thing for present
sale, though void of sense or Syntax, is listed by the booksellers as
an author. But allowing all our present writers to be men of parts and
learning (as there are doubtless some who may be reckoned so) is it
probable that they should exert their abilities to the utmost, when they do
not write for fame, like the Ancients, but as a means of subsistance. If
<HI>Herodotus</HI> and <HI>Livy</HI> had sold their histories at so much
a sheet, and all the other <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Latin</HI> Classics had
written in the same circumstances with many modern authors, they would
hardly have merited all that applause they so justly receive at
present. The plays of <HI>Sophocles</HI> and <HI>Euripides</HI> might perhaps
not have been much better than modern Tragedies; <HI>Virgil</HI> might have got
a dinner by half a dozen <HI>Town Eclogues</HI>; and <HI>Horace</HI> have wrote
Birth-day Odes, or now and then a lampoon on the company at the
<HI>Baiae.</HI></P>
<P>A FALSE modesty is another great cause of the few
publications by men of eminence and learning. However <PB N="252" REF="257"/>
equal to the task, they have not sufficient confidence to venture to the
press, but are rather guilty of wilful injustice to themselves and to the
public. They are also ashamed of appearing among the common herd of
authors. But the press, though it is often abused, should by no means be
accounted scandalous or dishonourable. Though a learned and ingenious
writer might not chuse to be mustered in the same roll with —
— — or Mr. TOWN, yet we have a HOOKE, a BROWNE, an AKINSIDE, and
many others in whose company it will be an honour to appear. I would not
willingly suppose that they are afraid to hazard the cha∣racters they now
maintain of being men of learning and abilities; for while we only take these
things for granted, their reputations are but weakly established. To
rescue our Native Language from the hands of ignorants and mercenaries is a
task worthy those who are accounted orna∣ments of our Seats of Learning;
and it is surely more than common ingratitude in those who eat the bread of
lite∣rature to refuse their utmost endeavours to support it.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="body of issue">
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG> FEW years ago an ingenious player gave notice in the bills
for his Benefit Night, that the Prologue should be spoken by the Pit, which
he contrived to have represented on the stage. Another time he drew in the
whole house to act as Chorus to a new farce, and I re∣member that in the
last rebellion the loyal acclamations of 
<Q REND="inline">"God save the King"</Q> might have been heard
from <HI>Drury Lane</HI> to <HI>Charing Cross.</HI> Upon these and many
other oc∣casions the audience has been known to enter into the im∣mediate
business of the Drama; and, to say the truth, I never go into the theatre
without looking on the spectators as playing a part almost as much as the
actors them∣selves. <PB N="254" REF="259"/> All the company from the
stage-box to the upper gallery know their cues very well, and perform their
parts with great spirit. I begun the season with a few ani∣madversions
on the chief faults to which our performers are liable. To-day I shall beg
leave to say a word or two to the Audience, as my reflections on the theatre
would otherwise be incomplete. On this occasion I expect the thanks of the
managers, and would recommend it to them to put my thirty fourth number into a
frame and glass, and hang it up in the Green Room for the benefit of the
play∣ers; and to dispose three or four thousand of the present number
into the several parts of the house, as <HI>Bayes</HI> dispersed papers
to insinuate the plot of his piece into the boxes.</P>
<P>THE first part of the audience that demands our atten∣tion is
so nearly allied to the actors that they always appear on the same level
with them: but while the performer endea∣vours to carry on the business of
the play, these gentlemen be∣hind the scenes serve only to hinder and
disturb it. There is no part of the house from which a play can be seen
to so little advantage as from the stage; yet this situation is very
convenient on many other considerations, of more conse∣quence to a fine
gentleman. It looks particular; it is the best place to shew a handsome
person, or an elegant suit of cloaths: a bow from the stage to a beauty
in the box is most likely to attract our notice; and a pretty fellow may
perhaps with tolerable management get the credit of an intrigue with some of
the actresses. But notwithstanding all these advantages accruing to our
fine gentlemen, I could heartily wish they would leave a clear stage to the
per∣formers; or at least that none should be admitted behind the scenes,
but such as would submit to be of some use there. As these gentlemen
are ready drest, they might help to swell the retinue of a monarch, join
the engagement in <PB N="255" REF="260"/> a Tragedy-battle, or do any other
little office that might occur in the play, which requires but little sense
and no memory. But if they have not any genius for acting, and are still
desirous of retaining their posts by the side-scenes, they should be
obliged to take a musket, bayonet, pouch, and the rest of the
accoutrements, and stand on guard quietly and decently with the
soldiers.</P>
<P>THE boxes are often filled with persons who do not come to the
theatre out of any regard to <HI>Shakespear</HI> or <HI>Garrick,</HI> but
like the fine lady in <HI>Lethe,</HI> 
<Q REND="inline">"because every body is there."</Q> As these
people cannot be expected to mind the play them∣selves, we can only desire
them not to call off the atten∣tion of others; nor interrupt the dialogue on
the stage by a louder conversation of their own. The silent courtship
of the eyes, ogles, nods, glances, and curtsies from one box to another may
be allowed them the same as at church, but nothing more, except at
Coronations, Funeral Processions and Pantomimes. Here I cannot help
recommending it to the gentlemen, who draw the pen from under their right ears
about seven o'clock, clap on a bag-wig and sword, and drop into the boxes
at the end of the third act, to take their halfcrown's worth with as much
decency as possible; as well as the Bloods who reel from the taverns about
<HI>Covent Garden</HI> near that time, and tumble drunk into the boxes. Before
I quit this part of the house I must take notice of that di∣vision of the
upper-boxes, properly distinguished by the name of the Flesh Market.
There is frequently as much art used to make the flesh exhibited here look
wholsome, and (as <HI>Tim</HI> says in the farce) 
<Q REND="inline">"all over red and white like the inside of a
shoulder of mutton,"</Q> as there is by the butchers to make their veal look
white; and it is as often rank carrion and flyblown. If these ladies would
appear <PB N="256" REF="261"/> in any other quarter of the house, I would only
beg of Them and those who come to market, to drive their bargains with as
little noise as possible: but I have lately observed with some
concern that these women begin to ap∣pear in the lower boxes to the
destruction of all order, and great confusion of all modest ladies. It is
to be hoped that some of their friends will advise them not to pretend to
appear there any more than at court: for it is as absurd to endeavour the
removal of their market into the front and side boxes, as it would be in the
butchers of St. <HI>James's Mar∣ket</HI> to attempt fixing the shambles in
St. <HI>James's Square.</HI></P>
<P>I MUST now desire the reader to descend with me among laced
hats and capuchines into the Pit. The Pit is the grand Court of Criticism,
and in the center of it is collected that awful body, distinguished by the
title of <HI>the Town.</HI> Hence are issued the irrevocable decrees, and
here final sentence is pronounced on plays and players. This Court has often
been very severe in its decisions, and has been known to declare many old
plays barbarously murdered, and most of our modern ones <HI>Felo de
se;</HI> but it must not be dissembled that many a cause of great
conse∣quence has been denied a fair hearing. Parties and private cabals have
often been formed to thwart the progress of merit, or to espouse
ignorance and dullness; for it is not wonderfull that the Parliament of
Criticism, like all others, should be liable to corruption. In this
assembly Mr. TOWN was first nominated CRITIC and CENSOR-GENERAL; but
considering the notorious bribery now prevailing, I think proper to declare,
(in imitation of <HI>Tom</HI> in the <HI>Conscious Lovers)</HI> that I never
took a single Order for my vote in all my life.</P>
<P>THOSE who pay their two shillings at the door of the 
<PB N="257" REF="262"/> Middle Gallery seem to frequent the theatre purely for
the sake of seeing the play. Though these peaceful regions are
sometimes disturbed by the incursions of rattling ladies of pleasure;
sometimes contain persons of fashion in dis∣guise, and sometimes
critics in ambush. The greatest fault I have to object to those who fill
this quarter of the thea∣tre, is their frequent and injudicious interruption of
the bu∣siness of the play by their applause. I have seen a bad actor
clapt two minutes together for ranting, or perhaps shrugging his shoulders,
and making wry faces: and I have seen the natural course of the
passions checked in a good one, by these ill-judged testimonies of
their approbation. It is recorded of <HI>Betterton</HI> to his honour, that he
thought a deep silence through the whole house, and a strict attention to
his playing, the strongest and surest signs of his being well
received.</P>
<P>THE inhabitants of the Upper-Gallery demand our no∣tice as well
as the rest of the theatre. The Trunk Maker of immortal memory was the most
celebrated hero of these regions; but since he is departed, and no
able-bodied critic appointed in his room, I cannot help giving the same
caution to the Upper-Gallery as to the gentry a pair of stairs lower. Some of
the under-comedians will perhaps be dis∣pleased at this order, who are
proud of these applauses, and rejoice to hear the lusty bangs from the
oaken towels of their friends against the wainscoat of the Upper-Gallery;
but I think they should not be allowed to shatter the pannels without
amending our taste; since their thwacks, however vehement, are seldom
laid on with sufficient judgment to ratify our applause. It were better
therefore if all the pre∣sent twelvepenny critics of this town, who preside
over our diversions in the Upper-Gallery, would content themselves with the
inferior duties of their office; <HI>viz.</HI> to take care 
<PB N="258" REF="263"/> that the play begins at the proper time, that the
music be∣tween the acts is of a due length, and that the candles are
snuffed in tune.</P>
<P>AFTER these brief admonitions concerning our behaviour at the
play, which are intended as a kind of <HI>vade mecum</HI> for the frequenters
of the theatre, I cannot conclude my paper more properly than with an extract
from the <HI>Tale of a Tub</HI> shewing the judicious distribution of our
playhouses into Boxes, Pit, and Galleries.</P>
<Q>I CONFESS, that there is something very refined in the
contrivance and structure of our modern theatres. For, first; the pit is
sunk below the stage that whatever <HI>weighty</HI> matter shall be
delivered thence (whether it be <HI>lead</HI> or <HI>gold)</HI> may fall plum
into the jaws of certain <HI>critics</HI> (as I think they are called) which
stand ready opened to devour them. Then, the boxes are built round, and
raised to a level with the scene, in deference to the ladies; because,
that large portion of wit, laid out in raising pruriences and protuberances,
is observed to run much upon a line, and ever in a circle. The whi∣ning
passions, and little starved conceits, are gently wafted up by their own
extreme levity, to the middle region, and there fix and are frozen by the
frigid under∣standings of the inhabitants. Bombastry and buffoonry, by
nature lofty and light, soar highest of all, and would be lost in the
roof, if the prudent architect had not with much foresight contrived for them
a fourth place, called <HI>the Twelve-Penny-Gallery,</HI> and there planted a
suitable co∣lony, who greedily intercept them in their passage.</Q>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> LATELY took a survey of the Female World, as CENSOR
GENERAL; and upon a strict review was very much surprized to find that
there is scarce any Woman to be met with, except among the lowest of the
vulgar. The sex consists almost entirely of LADIES. Every <HI>Joan</HI>
is lifted into a Lady; and the maid and the mistress are equally dignified
with this polite title. The stage∣coaches are constantly filled with
Ladies—At <HI>Bartholomew Fair</HI> there is always a hop for the
Ladies—And if the Ladies in the drawing-room are employed at Whist,
their last night's cards are made use of in a rubber by the Ladies in the

kitchen.—In a word, whenever there is occasion to speak of the Female
World, honourable mention is always made of them by the respectful
appellation of <HI>The</HI> LADIES: as the young and the old, the black and the
brown, the homely and the handsome, are all complaisantly included under
the general title of <HI>The</HI> FAIR.</P>
<P>SINCE therefore the Ladies of <HI>Great Britain</HI> make up
so numerous a body, I should be loth to disoblige so conside∣rable a
sister-hood, and shall devote this paper entirely to their service. I
propose at present to marshal them into their respective ranks, and
upon a review I find that they may be justly distributed under these five
divisions; <HI>viz.</HI> Married Ladies, Maiden or Young Ladies, Ladies of
Qua∣lity, Fine Ladies, and lastly (without affront to the good company)
Ladies of Pleasure.</P>
<P>I SHALL begin with the Married Ladies, as this order will be
found to be far the most numerous, and includes all the married women in town
or country above the degree of a chair-woman or the trundler of a wheel-barrow.
The plain old <HI>English</HI> word Wife has long been discarded in our
conversation, as being only fit for the broad mouths of the vulgar. A
well-bred ear is startled at the very sound of Wife, as at a coarse and
indelicate expression; and I ap∣peal to any fashionable couple, whether
they would not be as much ashamed to be mentioned together as man and wife,
as they would to appear together at court in a farthingale and trunk-breeches.
From <HI>Hyde Park Corner</HI> to <HI>Temple-Bar</HI> this monster of a Wife
has not been heard of since the antiquated times of Dame and Your Wor∣ship;
and in the city every good house-wife is at least <HI>a Lady of the other
end of the town.</HI> In the country you might as well dispute the
pretensions of every foxhunter to <PB N="261" REF="268"/> the title of
Esquire, as of his help-mate to that of Lady; and in every corporation town
whoever matches with a burgess becomes a Lady by right of charter. My
cousin VILLAGE, (from whom I have all my rural intelligence,) informs me,
that upon the strictrest enquiry there is but one Wife in the town where he
now lives, and that is the Par∣son's Wife, who is never mentioned by the
country Ladies but as a dowdy, and an old-fashioned creature. Such is the
great privilege of matrimony, that every female is enno∣bled by changing her
surname: for as every unmarried woman is a Miss, every married one by the
same courtesy is a Lady.</P>
<P>THE next order of dignified females is composed of Maiden or
Young Ladies; which terms are synonymous, and are indifferently applied to
females of the age of fourteen or threescore. We must not therefore be
surprized to hear of Maiden Ladies, who are known to have had several
chil∣dren, or to meet with Young Ladies that look like old dowagers. At the
house of an acquaintance where I lately visited, I was told that we were to
expect Mrs. <HI>Jackson</HI> and the two Miss <HI>Wrinkles.</HI> But what
was my surprize! when I saw on their arrival a blooming female of
twenty-five accosted under the first denomination, and the two nymphs, as I
expected, come tottering into the room, the youngest of them to all
appearance on the verge of three∣score. I could not help wishing on this
occasion that some middle term was invented between <HI>Miss</HI> and
<HI>Mrs.</HI> to be adopted, at a certain age, by all females not inclined to
matrimony. For surely nothing can be more ridiculous, than to hear a
greyhaired Lady past her Grand Climacteric mentioned in terms, that convey
the idea of youth and beauty, or perhaps of a bib and hanging-sleeves. This
indiscriminate appellation also unavoidably creates much 
<PB N="262" REF="269"/> confusion: I know an eminent tradesman who lost a
very good customer for innocently writing <HI>Mrs.</HI> — at the head
of her bill: and I was lately at a ball, where, trusting to a friend for a
partner, I was obliged to do penance with an old withered beldam, who hobbled
through several country dances with me, though she was ancient enough to
have been my grandmother. Excluding these Young Ladies of fifty and sixty,
this order of females is very numerous; for there is scarce a girl in town or
country, superior to a milk∣maid or cinderwench, but is comprehended in it.
The daughters are indisputably Young Ladies, though their Papas may be
tradesmen or mechanics. For the present race of shopkeepers &amp;c. have
wisely provided, that their gentility shall be preserved in the female
part of the family. Thus, although the son is called plain <HI>Jack,</HI> and
perhaps bound apprentice to his father, the daughter is taught to hold up her
head, make tea in the little parlour behind the shop, and inherits the title
of Lady from her Mama. To make these claims to dignity more sure those
excellent seminaries of genteel education, called Boarding-Schools, have been
contrived; where instead of teazing a sampler, or conning a chapter of the
bible, the Young Ladies are instructed to hold up their heads, make a
curtsey, and to behave themselves in every respect like pretty little
Ladies. Hence it happens, that we may often observe several of these
polite damsels in the skirts of <HI>White-Chapel,</HI> and in every petty
country town; nay, it is common to meet with Young Ladies <HI>born and
bred,</HI> who have submitted to keep a chandler's shop, or had humility
enough even to go to service.</P>
<P>I PROCEED next to take into consideration what is gene∣rally
understood by Ladies of Quality. These in other words may be more properly
called Ladies of Fashion; for in the modish acceptation of the phrase not
so much re∣gard <PB N="263" REF="270"/> is had to their birth or station, or
even to their co∣ronet, as to their way of life. The dutchess, who has not
taste enough to act up to the character of a Person of Quality, is no more
respected in the polite world than a city knight's Lady; nor does she
derive any greater honour from her title, than the hump-backed woman receives
from the vulgar. But what is immediately expected from a Lady of Quality, will
be seen under the next article: for to their praise be it spoken, most
of our modern Ladies of Quality affect to be Fine Ladies.</P>
<P>TO describe the life of a Fine Lady would be only to set
down a perpetual round of visiting, gaming, dressing, and intriguing. She
has been bred up in the notion of making a figure, and of recommending
herself as a woman of spirit: for which end she is always foremost in
the fashion, and never fails gracing with her appearance every public
assembly, and every party of pleasure. Though sin∣gle, she may coquet
with every fine gentleman; or if mar∣ried, she may admit of gallantries
without reproach, and even receive visits from the men in her bed-chamber. To
complete the character, and to make her a Very Fine Lady, she should be
celebrated for her wit and beauty, and be parted from her husband: for as
matrimony itself is not meant as a restraint upon a pleasure, a
separate maintenance is understood as a licence to throw off even the
appearance of virtue.</P>
<P>FROM the Fine Ladies it is a very natural transition to the
Ladies of Pleasure; and indeed from what has already been said concerning
Fine Ladies one might imagine that, as they make pleasure their sole
pursuit, they might pro∣perly be entitled Ladies of Pleasure. But this gay
appella∣tion is reserved for the higher rank of Prostitutes, whose 
<PB N="264" REF="271"/> principal difference from the Fine Ladies consists
in their professing a trade, which the others carry on by smug∣gling. A
Lady of Fashion, who refuses no favours but the last, or even grants that
without being paid for it, is not to be accounted a Lady of Pleasure, but
ranks in an order formerly celebrated under the title of DEMI-REPS. It is
whimsical enough to see the different complexions assumed by the same
vice, according to the difference of stations. The married Lady of Quality
may intrigue with as many as she pleases, and still remain <HI>Right
Honourable:</HI> The draggle-tailed Street-Walker is a <HI>Common Woman,</HI>
and li∣able to be sent to <HI>Bridewell</HI>; but the Whore of High Life is a
<HI>Lady of Pleasure,</HI> and rolls in a gilt chariot.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">W</SEG>HEN I first resolved on appearing in my present
character, I had some thoughts of making my public entry in the front of one
or other of our News-papers; as I con∣sidered that the domestic
occurrences, which compose a part of their equipage, would make no bad figure
in my own retinue. Some reflections on the modish methods of gaming, would
receive an additional confir∣mation from a paragraph in the News, that 
<Q REND="inline">"last Tuesday a game at Whist was played
at <HI>White</HI>'s for 1000<HI>l.</HI> a corner,"</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">"or that the match between his Grace the Duke of

disserta∣tion on the luxury of the present age would be very aptly 
<PB N="266" REF="273"/> illustrated by an exact account of the weight of the
Turtle dressed a few days before for the gentlemen of the above∣mentioned
Chocolate-house.</P>
<P>INDEED I have always looked upon the works of Mr.
<HI>Jenour</HI> in the <HI>Daily Advertiser</HI> as a kind of supplement to
the intelligence of Mr. TOWN; as containing a more minute account of the
important transactions of that class of man∣kind, which has been
figuratively stiled <HI>The World.</HI> From these daily registers, you
may not only learn when any body is married or hanged, but you have immediate
notice, whenever his Grace goes to <HI>Newmarket,</HI> or her Ladyship sets
out for <HI>Bath:</HI> and but last week, at the same time that the
gentlemen of the law were told that the Lord Chan∣cellor could not sit in the
Court of Chancery, people of fashion had the melancholy news that Signor
<HI>Ricciarelli</HI> was not able to sing.</P>
<P>NOR is that part of Mr. <HI>Jenour</HI>'s lucubrations, which is
allotted to Advertisements, less amusing and entertaining: and many of
these articles might very properly come under my cognizance. It is here
debated, whether the prize of eloquence should be given to Orator
<HI>Macklin</HI> or Orator <HI>Henley</HI>; and whether Mr. <HI>Stephen
Pitts</HI> is not the best qualified to furnish gentlemen and ladies
libraries with tea∣chests in <HI>Octavo,</HI> and close-stools in
<HI>Folio.</HI> And besides the public notices to persons of taste, of
very rare and old Japan, and most curious and inimitable <HI>Epagnes</HI> for
deserts, as also the most rich and elegant fancied silks to be sold
by auction; many other advices not less interesting to the Town, are here
given. We are daily put in mind, that Mrs. <HI>Phillips</HI> at the Green
Canister still hopes for the favours of her former good customers as
usual: that next door to <HI>Had∣docks</HI>'s <PB N="267" REF="274"/> is
sold an antidote against the poison imbibed at that bagnio: that Dr.
<HI>Rock</HI> infallibly cures a certain epidemical distemper by virtue of
the King's Patent: that a learned physician and surgeon will privately
accommodate any gentleman (as the Doctor modestly expresses it in his own
<HI>Latin) Pro Morbus Vaneria curandus:</HI> and that Y. Z. a regu∣lar-bred
surgeon and man-midwife, together with fifty others, will accommodate
gentlewomen, that are under a necessity of lying in privately.</P>
<P>BUT not only the public transactions of Auctioneers, Brokers,
and Horse-dealers, but the most private concerns of pleasure and
gallantry may be also carried on by means of this paper. Assignations are
here made, and the most secret intrigues formed at the expence of two
shillings. If a genteel young body, who can do all kinds of work, wants a
place, she will be sure to hear of a master by advertising: Any
gentleman and lady of <HI>unexceptionable character</HI> may meet with lodgings
to be let, and no questions asked: How often has <HI>Romeo</HI> declared in
print his unspeakable passion for the charming <HI>Peachy!</HI> How many
gentlemen have made open professions of the strictest honour and
se∣cresy! And how many ladies, drest in such a manner, and seen at
such a place, have been desired to leave a line for <HI>A.B.</HI> Before
the late Marriage Act it was very usual for young gentlemen and ladies
(possest of every qualification requisite to make the marriage state
happy) to offer themselves as a good bargain to each other; and men took the
same mea∣sures of advertising to get an agreeable companion for life, as
they do for an agreeable companion in a post-chaise. As this traffick in
matrimony is now prohibited, it has given occasion to the opening a new
branch of trade; and since husbands and wives are hardly to be got for love
or money, several good-natured females have set themselves up to sale 
<PB N="268" REF="275"/> to the best bidder. The <HI>Daily Advertiser</HI> is
therefore be∣come the universal register for new faces; and every day's
advertisements are crouded with offers of young ladies, who would be glad of
the company of any elderly gentleman, to pass his leisure hours with them,
and <HI>play at cards.</HI></P>
<P>I LOOK upon the common intelligence in our public papers, with
the long train of advertisements annexed to it, as the best account of the
present domestic state of <HI>England,</HI> that can possibly be
compiled: nor do I know any thing which would give posterity so clear an
idea of the taste and morals of the present age, as a bundle of our daily
papers. They would here see what books are most read, what are our chief
amusements and diversions: and when they should observe the daily
inquiries after eloped wives and apprentices, and the frequent accounts of
trials in <HI>Westminster Hall</HI> for Perjury, Adultery, &amp;c. they
might form a tolerable notion even of our private life. Among many other
reasons for lamenting that the Art of Printing was not more early
discovered, I cannot but regret that we have perhaps lost many accounts of
this nature, which might o∣therwise have been handed down to us. With what
plea∣sure should we have perused an <HI>Athenian</HI> Advertiser, or a
<HI>Roman</HI> Gazetteer! A curious critic or antiquarian would place them on
the same shelf with the Classics, and would be highly pleased at
discovering what days <HI>Tully</HI> went to his <HI>Tusculum,</HI> or
<HI>Pliny</HI> to his magnificent <HI>Villa</HI>; who was the capital singer
at the <HI>Graecian</HI> Opera, and in what characters <HI>Roscius</HI>
appeared with most success. These pieces of intel∣ligence would
undoubtedly give great satisfaction; and I am myself acquainted with a very
learned gentleman, who has assured me, that he has been as much delighted
at disco∣vering that the <HI>Sosii</HI> were <HI>Horace</HI>'s
booksellers, that the <HI>Hecyra</HI> of <HI>Terence</HI> was damned, and
other little particulars <PB N="269" REF="276"/> of that nature, as with an
account of the destruction of <HI>Carthage,</HI> or the death of
<HI>Caesar.</HI> We should also be glad to collect from their
advertisements what things were most in request at <HI>Athens</HI> and
<HI>Rome.</HI> Even our papers, (which perhaps are called <HI>Daily</HI> from
their lasting but a day) are, I fear, of too fugitive a nature to fall under
the inspection of posterity. To remedy, in some measure, this
inconve∣nience, I shall now conclude my paper with a few adver∣tisements,
which if they have not all actually been inserted in our papers, are at
least of the same nature with those, that daily have a place there.</P>

<LETTER>
<HEAD>To Mr. TOWN.</HEAD>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>T is whimsical to observe the mistakes that we country
gentlemen are led into at our first coming to town. We are induced to think,
and indeed truly, that your fine ladies are composed of different materials
from our rural ones; since, though they sleep all day and rake all night,
they still remain as fresh and ruddy as a parson's daughter or a farmer's
wife. At other times we are apt to wonder, that such delicate creatures as
they ap∣pear should yet be so much proof against cold, as to look as
rosy in <HI>January</HI> as in <HI>June,</HI> and even in the sharpest
weather <PB N="272" REF="279"/> to be very unwilling to approach the fire. I was
at a loss to account for this unalterable hue of their complexions: but I
soon found that beauty was not more peculiar to the air of St.
<HI>James</HI>'s than of <HI>York</HI>; and that this perpetual bloom was not
native, but imported from abroad. Not content with that red and white which
nature gave, your belles are reduced (as they pretend) to the necessity of
supplying the flush of health with the <HI>rouge</HI> of vermilion, and
giving us <HI>Spanish</HI> wool for <HI>English</HI> beauty.</P>
<P>THE very reason alledged for this fashionable practice is
such, as (if they seriously considered it) the ladies would be
ashamed to mention. 
<Q REND="inline">"The late hours they are <HI>obliged</HI> to
keep, render them such <HI>perfect frights,</HI> that they would be as loth
to appear abroad without paint as without cloaths."</Q> This, it must be
acknowledged, is too true: But would they suffer their fathers or their
husbands to wheel them down for one month to the old mansion-house, they
would soon be sensible of the change, and soon per∣ceive how much the
early walk exceeds the late assembly. The vigils of the card-table have
spoiled many a good face; and I have known a beauty stick to the midnight
rubbers, till she has grown as homely as the Queen of Spades. There is
nothing more certain in all <HI>Hoyle</HI>'s cases, than that Whist and
late hours will ruin the finest set of features: but if the ladies would
give up their routes for the healthy amuse∣ments of the country, I will
venture to say their carmine would be then as useless as their artificial
nosegays.</P>
<P>A MORALIST might talk to them of the heinousness of this
practice; since all deceit is criminal, and painting is no better than
looking a lye. And should they urge that nobody is deceived by it, he might
add, that the plea for admitting it is then at an end; since few are yet
arrived at <PB N="273" REF="280"/> that height of <HI>French</HI> politeness,
as to dress their cheeks in public, and to profess wearing vermilion as
openly as powder. But I shall content myself with using an argu∣ment more
likely to prevail: and such I trust will be the assurance, that this
practice is highly disagreeable to the men. What must be the mortification,
and what the disgust of the lover, who goes to bed to a bride as blooming
as an angel, and finds her in the morning as wan and yellow as a corpse? For
marriage soon takes off the mask; and all the resources of art, all the
my∣steries of the toilet are then at an end. He that is thus wedded to a
cloud instead of a <HI>Juno,</HI> may well be al∣lowed to complain, but
without relief: for this is a custom, which once admitted so tarnishes
the skin, that it is next to impossible ever to retrieve it. Let me
therefore caution those young beginners, who are not yet discoloured past
redemption, to leave it off in time, and endeavour to procure and preserve by
early hours that unaffected bloom, which art cannot give, and which only age or
sickness can take away.</P>
<P>OUR beauties were formerly above making use of so poor an
artifice: They trusted to the lively colouring of nature, which was
heightened by temperance and exercise; but our modern belles are obliged to
retouch their cheeks every day, to keep them in repair. We were then as
superior to the <HI>French</HI> in the assembly as in the field: but
since a trip to <HI>France</HI> has been thought a requisite in the
education of our ladies as well as gentlemen, our polite females have thought
fit to dress their faces as well as their heads <HI>a là mode de
Paris.</HI> I am told, that when an <HI>English</HI> lady is at
<HI>Paris,</HI> she is so surrounded with false faces, that she is
herself obliged (if she would not appear singular) to put on 
<PB N="274" REF="281"/> the mask. But who would exchange the brilliancy of the
diamond for the faint lustre of <HI>French</HI> paste? And for my part I
would as soon expect, that an <HI>English</HI> beauty at <HI>Morocco</HI>
would japan her face with lamb-black, in complaisance to the sable beauties
of that country. Let the <HI>French</HI> ladies white∣wash and plaister
their fronts, and lay on their colours with a trowel: but these dawbings of
art are no more to be com∣pared to the genuine glow of a <HI>British</HI>
cheek, than the coarse streaks of the painter's brush can resemble the
native veins of the marble. This contrast is placed in a proper light in Mr.
<HI>Addison</HI>'s fine epigram on Lady <HI>Manchester</HI>; which will
serve to convince us of the force of undissembled beauty. 
<Q> 
<L>When haughty <HI>Gallia</HI>'s dames, that spread</L> 
<L>O'er their pale checks a lifeless red,</L> 
<L>Beheld this beauteous stranger there,</L> 
<L>In native charms divinely fair,</L> 
<L>Confusion in their looks they show'd,</L> 
<L>And with unborrow'd blushes glow'd.</L></Q> I think, Mr.
TOWN, you might easily prevail on your fair readers to leave off this
unnatural practice, if you could once thoroughly convince them, that it impairs
their beauty instead of improving it. A lady's face, like the coats in the
<HI>Tale of a Tub,</HI> if left to itself, will wear well; but if you offer
to load it with foreign orna∣ments, you destroy the original ground.</P>
<P>AMONG other matter of wonder on my first coming to town, I
was much surprised at the general appearance of youth among the ladies. At
present there is no distinction in their complexions between a beauty in
her teens and a lady in her grand climacteric: yet at the same time I 
<PB N="275" REF="282"/> could not but take notice of the wonderful variety in
the face of the same lady. I have known an olive beauty on a Monday grow very
ruddy and blooming on Tuesday; turn pale on Wednesday; come round to the
olive hue again on Thursday; and in a word, change her complexion as often as
her gown. I was amazed to find no old aunts in this town, except a few
unfashionable people, whom no body knows; the rest still continuing in
the zenith of their youth and health, and falling off, like timely fruit,
without any previous decay. All this was a mystery that I could not unriddle,
'till on being introduced to some ladies, I unluckily improved the hue of my
lips at the expence of a fair one, who unthinkingly had turned her cheek; and
found that my kisses were given, (as is observed in the epi∣gram) like
those of <HI>Pyramus,</HI> through a wall. I then found, that this
surprising youth and beauty was all counterfeit; and that (as
<HI>Hamlet</HI> says) 
<Q REND="inline">"God had given them one face, and they had
made themselves another."</Q></P>
<P>I HAVE mentioned the accident of my carrying off half a lady's
face by a salute, that your courtly dames may learn to put on their faces a
little tighter; but as for my own daughters, while such fashions prevail,
they shall still re∣main in <HI>Yorkshire.</HI> There, I think, they are
pretty safe; for this unnatural fashion will hardly make its way into the
country, as this vamped complexion would not stand against the rays of the
sun, and would inevitably melt away in a country dance. The ladies have,
indeed, been always the greatest enemies to their own beauty, and seem to
have a design against their own faces. At one time the whole countenance
was eclipsed in a black velvet mask; at another it was blotted with
patches; and at present it is crusted over with plaister of
<HI>Paris.</HI> In those battered belles, who still <PB N="276" REF="283"/>
aim at conquest, this practice is in some sort excusable; but it is
surely as ridiculous in a young lady to give up beauty for paint, as it would
be to draw a good set of teeth merely to fill their places with a row of
ivory.</P>
<P>INDEED, so common is this fashion among the young as well
as the old, that when I am in a groupe of beau∣ties, I consider them as so
many pretty pictures; looking about me with as little emotion, as I do at
<HI>Hudson</HI>'s: And if any thing fills me with admiration, it is the
judi∣cious arrangement of the tints, and the delicate touches of the painter.
Art very often seems almost to vye with nature: but my attention is too
frequently diverted by considering the texture and hue of the skin beneath;
and the picture fails to charm, while my thoughts are engrossed by the wood
and canvass.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="body of issue">
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>T has hitherto been imagined, that though we have equalled, if
not surpassed, the ancients in other liberal arts, we have not yet been
able to arrive at that height of eloquence, which was possessed in so
amaz∣ing a manner by the <HI>Grecian</HI> and <HI>Roman</HI> Orators. Whether
this has been owing to any peculiar organization of our tongues, or whether it
has proceeded from our national love of taciturnity, I shall not take upon me
to determine: but I will now venture to affirm, that the present times might
furnish us with a more surprising number of Fine Speakers, than have been
set down by <HI>Tully</HI> in his treatise <HI>De Claris Oratoribus.</HI>
Foreigners can no longer object to us, that the northern coldness of our
climate has (as it were) <PB N="278" REF="285"/> pursed up our lips, and that
we are afraid to open our mouths: The charm is at length dissolved; and our
people, who before affected the gravity and silence of the <HI>Spaniard,</HI>
have adopted and naturalized the volubility of speech, as well as the gay
manners, of the <HI>French.</HI></P>
<P>THIS change has been brought about by the public-spirited
attempts of those elevated geniusses, who have insti∣tuted certain
schools for the cultivation of eloquence in all its branches. Hence it is,
that instead of languid discourses from the pulpit, several tabernacles
and meeting-houses have been set up, where lay-preachers may display all
the powers of oratory in sighs and groans, and emulate a <HI>White∣field</HI>
or a <HI>Wesley</HI> in all the figures of rhetoric.—And not only the
enthusiast has his conventicles, but even the free-thinker boasts his
Societies, where he may hold forth against reli∣gion in tropes, metaphors,
and similies. The declamations weekly thundered out at <HI>Clare-Market,</HI>
and the subtle argu∣mentations at the <HI>Robin Hood,</HI> I have formerly
celebrated: It now remains to pay my respects to the <HI>Martin Luther</HI>
of the age, (as he frequently calls himself,) the great <HI>Orator</HI>
MACKLIN; who by declaiming himself, and opening a school for the
disputations of others, has joined both the above plans together, and formed
the BRITISH INQUISITION. Here, whatever concerns the world of taste and
literature, is debated: Our rakes and bloods, who had been used to fre∣quent
<HI>Covent-Garden</HI> merely for the sake of whoring and drinking, now
resort thither for reason and argument; and the <HI>Piazza</HI> begins to
vie with the ancient <HI>Portico,</HI> where <HI>Socrates</HI> disputed.</P>
<P>BUT what pleases me most in Mr. MACKLIN's Insti∣tution is,
that he has allowed the tongues of my fair country-women their full play. Their
natural talents for <PB N="279" REF="286"/> Oratory are so excellent and
numerous, that it seems more owing to the envy than prudence of the other
sex, that they should be denied the opportunity of exerting them. The
remarkable tendency in our politest ladies 
<Q REND="inline">"to talk, though they have nothing to
say;"</Q> and the torrent of eloquence that pours (on the most trivial
occasions) from the lips of those females, called Scolds; give abundant
proofs of that command of words, and flow of eloquence, which so few men have
been able to attain. Again, if action is the life and soul of an oration, how
many advantages have the ladies in this particular? The waving of a snowy
arm, art∣fully shaded with the enchanting slope of a double ruffle, would
have twenty times the force of the stiff see-saw of a male orator: and
when they come to the most ani∣mated parts of the oration, which demand
uncommon warmth and agitation, we should be vanquished by the heaving
breast, and all those other charms, which the modern dress is so well
calculated to display.</P>
<P>SINCE the ladies are thus undeniably endued with these and
many other accomplishments for Oratory, that no place should hitherto have
been opened for their exerting them, is almost unaccountable. The lower order
of fe∣males have, indeed, long ago instituted an academy of this kind at the
other end of the town, where oysters and eloquence are in equal perfection:
but the politer part of the female world have hitherto had no further
opportunity of exercising their abilities, than the common occasions which
a new cap or petenlair, the tea or the card table, have afforded them. I am
therefore heartily glad, that a plan is at length put in execution, which will
encourage their propensity to talking, and enlarge their topics of
conversation: but I would more particularly recommend <PB N="280" REF="287"/>
it to all ladies of a clamorous disposition, to attend at MACK∣LIN's; that
the impetuous stream of eloquence, which, for want of another vent, has long
been poured on their servants or husbands, may now be carried off by
another more agreeable channel.</P>
<P>I COULD not have thought it possible, that this under∣taking
would have subsisted two nights without setting all the female tongues
from <HI>St. James's</HI> to <HI>Temple-Bar</HI> in motion. But the ladies have
hitherto been dumb; and Female Eloquence seems as unlikely to display
itself in pub∣lick as ever. Whether their modesty will not permit them to
open their mouths in the unhallowed air of <HI>Covent-Gar∣den,</HI> I know not:
but I am rather inclined to think, that the Questions proposed have not
been sufficiently calcu∣lated for the female part of the assembly. They
might perhaps be tempted to debate, 
<Q REND="inline">"whether <HI>Fanny Murray</HI> or Lady —
were the properest to lead the fashion;"—</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">"to what lengths a lady might proceed without
the loss of her reputation;"—</Q>or 
<Q REND="inline">"whether the Beautifying Lotion or the Royal
Washball were the most excellent Cosmetics."</Q> It might also be
expected, in complaisance to the fair sex, that the INQUISITOR should now
and then read a disser∣tation on Natural and Artificial Beauty; in which he
might (with that softness and delicacy peculiar to himself) analyse a
lady's face, and give examples of the ogle, the simper, the smile, the
languish, the dimple, &amp;c. with a word or two on the use and benefit of
paint.</P>
<P>BUT these points I shall leave to Mr. MACKLIN's
con∣sideration: In the mean time, as it is not in my power to oblige the
public with a Lady's Speech, I shall fill up the remainder of my paper with
an Oration, which my corres∣pondent is desirous should appear in print,
though he had not sufficient confidence to deliver it at the INQUISITION.</P>

<HEAD>QUESTION. Whether the Stage might not be made more
conducive to Virtue?</HEAD>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>Mr. INQUISITOR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE ancient drama had, we know, a religious as well as
political view; and was designed to inspire the audience with a reverence
to the Gods and a love of their country. Our own Stage, upon particular
occasions, has been made to answer the same ends: Thus we may remember
during the last rebellion, besides the loyalty of the fiddles in the
Orchestra, we were inspired with a detesta∣tion of the pope and pretender
by the <HI>Nonjuror,</HI> the <HI>Jesuit Caught,</HI> and such other
politico-religious dramas; among which I must not forget to
mention—(what's the name on't, Mr. INQUISITOR?—what's the name
on't?—oh)—<HI>Perkin Warbeck, Or the Popish Impostor.</HI></P>
<P>BUT there is a species of the drama, which has not yet
been mentioned by any of the gentlemen who have spoke to the question, and
which is very deficient in point of moral: I mean, Pantomimes. Mr.
<HI>Laws</HI> has been very severe on the impiety of representing heathen
gods and goddesses before a truly Christian audience: and to this we may
add, that Harlequin is but a wicked sort of fellow, and is always running
after the girls. For my part I have often blushed to see this impudent rake
endeavouring to creep under Columbine's petticoats, and at other times patting
her neck, and laying his legs upon her lap. Nobody will say indeed, that
there is much virtue or morality in these entertainments: though it must be
confessed to the honour of our neighbour∣ing house here, that the
<HI>Necromancer</HI> and the <HI>Sorcerer,</HI> after having played many
unchristian pranks upon the stage, are at last fairly sent to the
devil. I would therefore recom∣mend it to our Pantomime-writers, that instead
of the <PB N="282" REF="289"/> <HI>Pantheon,</HI> or lewd comedies, they would
take their subjects from some Old Garland, Moral Ballad, or Penny History
Book. Suppose, for example, they were to give us the story of <HI>Patient
Grizzle</HI> in dumb shew; setting forth, as how a noble lord fell in love
with her, as he was hunting;—and there you might have the scene of the
Spinning Wheel, and the song of the <HI>Early Horn</HI>;—and as how,
after many tryals of her patience, which they might represent by machi∣nery,
this lord at last married her;—and then you may have a Grand Temple and
a Dance. The other house have already revived the good old story of
<HI>Fortunatus</HI>'s Wishing-cap; and as they are fond of introducing little
children in their entertainments, suppose they were to exhibit a Panto∣mime
of the <HI>Three Children in the Wood:</HI>—'twould be vastly pretty to
see the paste-board robin-red-breasts let down by wires upon the stage,
to cover the poor innocent babes with paper leaves. But if they must have
<HI>Fairies,</HI> and <HI>Genii,</HI> I would advise them to take their
stories out of that pretty little book, called the <HI>Fairy Tales.</HI> I am
sure, instead of ostriches, dogs, horses, lions, monkeys, &amp;c. we
should be full as well pleased to see the <HI>Wolf and little red
Riding-Hood</HI>; and we should laugh vastly at the adventures of
<HI>Puss in Boots.</HI> I need not point out the excellent moral, which would
be inculcated by representations of this kind; and I am confident they would
meet with the deserved applause of all the old women and children in both
galleries.</P>

<P><PB N="284" REF="291"/>THOSE old-fashioned mortals who have
been accustomed to look upon this season with extraordinary devotion, I
leave to con over the explanation of it in <HI>Nelson:</HI> It shall at
present be my business to shew the different methods of celebrating it
in these kingdoms. With the generality, <HI>Christmas</HI> is looked upon
as a festival in the most literal sense, and held sacred by good
eating and drinking. These, in∣deed, are the most distinguishing marks
of <HI>Christmas:</HI> The revenue from the malt-tax and the duty upon wines,
&amp;c. on account of these twelve days, has always been found to encrease
considerably: And it is impossible to conceive the slaughter that is
made among the poultry and the hogs in dif∣ferent parts of the country, to
furnish the prodigious numbers of turkeys and chines, and collars of brawn,
that travel up, as presents, to the metropolis on this occasion. The jolly
cit looks upon this joyous time of feasting, with as much plea∣sure as on
the treat of a new-elected alderman, or a lord-mayor's day. Nor can the country
farmer rail more against the Game-Act, than many worthy citizens, who have
ever since been debarred of their annual hare; while their ladies can never
enough regret their loss of the opportunity of dis∣playing their skill,
in making a most excellent pudding in the belly. But these notable
house-wives have still the consolation of hearing their guests commend
the mince-pies without meat, which we are assured were made at home, and
not like the ordinary heavy things from the pastry-cooks. These good people
would look upon the absence of mince-pies as the highest violation of
<HI>Christmas</HI>; and have remarked with concern the disregard that has
been shewn of late years to that Old <HI>English</HI> repast: For this
excellent <HI>British Ollio</HI> is as essential to <HI>Christmas,</HI>
as pancake to Shrove Tuesday, tansy to Easter, furmity to Midlent-Sunday,
or goose to Michaelmas Day. And they think it no wonder, 
<PB N="285" REF="292"/> that our finical gentry should be so loose in
their principles, as well as weak in their bodies, when the solid,
substantial, Protestant mince-pie has given place among them to the Roman
Catholic <HI>Aumlets,</HI> and the light, puffy, heterodox <HI>Pets de
Religieuses.</HI></P>
<P>AS this season used formerly to be welcomed in with more
than usual jollity in the country, it is probable that the
<HI>Christmas</HI> remembrances, with which the waggons and stage-coaches
are at this time loaded, first took their rise from the laudable custom
of distributing provisions at this se∣vere quarter of the year to the
poor. But these presents are now seldom sent to those who are really
in want of them, but are designed as compliments to the great from their
inferiors, and come chiefly from the tenant to his rich land-lord, or from the
rector of a fat living, as a kind of tythe, to his patron. Nor is the old
hospitable <HI>English</HI> custom, of keeping open house for the poor
neighbourhood, any longer regarded. We might as soon expect to see
plumb-porridge fill a terrene at the ordinary at <HI>White</HI>'s, as that the
lord of the manour should assemble his poor tenants to make merry at the
great house. The servants swill the <HI>Christmas</HI> ale by
themselves in the hall, while the squire gets drunk with his brother
foxhunters in the smoking-room.</P>
<P>THERE is no rank of people so heartily rejoiced at the arrival
of this joyful season, as the order of servants, journey∣men, and
apprentices, and the lower sort of people in gene∣ral. No master or
mistress is so rigid, as to refuse them an holiday; and by remarkable
good luck the same circum∣stance, which gives them an opportunity of
diverting them∣selves, procures then money to support it, by the tax which
custom has imposed upon us in the article of <HI>Christmas-Boxes.</HI> 
<PB N="286" REF="293"/> The butcher and the baker send their journey-men and
apprentices to levy contributions on their customers, which are paid back
again in the usual fees to Mr. <HI>John</HI> and Mrs. <HI>Mary.</HI> This
serves the tradesman as a pretence to lengthen out his bill, and the
master and mistress to lower the wages on account of the vails. The
<HI>Christmas</HI> Box was formerly the bounty of well-disposed people,
who were willing to contribute something towards rewarding the
indus∣trious, and supplying them with necessaries. But the gift is now
almost demanded as a right; and our journeymen, apprentices &amp;c. are grown
so polite, that instead of reserving their <HI>Christmas</HI> Box for
its original use, their ready cash serves them only for present
pocket-money; and instead of visiting their friends and relations, they
commence the fine gentlemen of the week. The sixpenny hop is crouded with
ladies and gentlemen from the kitchen; the Syrens of <HI>Cathe∣rine Street</HI>
charm many an holiday gallant into their snares; and the play-houses are
filled with beaux, wits and critics, from <HI>Cheapside</HI> and
<HI>White-Chapel.</HI> The barrows are sur∣rounded with raw lads setting
their halfpence against oranges; and the greasy cards and dirty
cribbage-board employ the genteeler gamesters in every ale-house. A merry
<HI>Christmas</HI> has ruined many a promising young fellow, who has been
flush of money at the beginning of the week, but before the end of it has
committed a robbery on the till for more.</P>
<P>BUT in the midst of this general festivity there are some
so far from giving into any extraordinary merriment, that they seem more
gloomy than usual, and appear with faces as dismal as the month in which
<HI>Christmas</HI> is celebrated. I have heard a plodding citizen most
grievously complain of the great expence of house-keeping at this
season, when his own and his wife's relations claim the privilege of
kin∣dred <PB N="287" REF="294"/> to eat him out of house and home: Then again,
considering the present total decay of trade, and the great load of taxes,
it is a shame that poor shopkeepers should be so fleeced and plundered,
under the pretence of <HI>Christmas</HI> Boxes. But if tradesmen have any
reason to murmur at <HI>Christmas,</HI> many of their customers, on the
other hand, tremble at its approach; as it is made a sanction to every petty
mechanic, to break in upon their joy, and disturb a gentleman's repose at
this time, by bringing in his bill.</P>
<P>OTHERS, who used to be very merry at this season, have
within this year or two been quite disconcerted. To put them out of their old
way, is to put them out of humour: they have therefore quarrelled with the
almanack, and re∣fuse to keep their <HI>Christmas</HI> according to Act of
Parliament. My Cousin VILLAGE informs me, that this obstinacy is very
common in the country; and that many still persist in waiting eleven days
for their mirth, and defer their <HI>Christmas</HI> till the blowing of the
<HI>Glastonbury Thorn.</HI> In some, indeed, this cavilling with the
calendar has been only the result of close oeconomy; who by evading the
expence of keeping <HI>Christmas</HI> with the rest of the world, find
means to ne∣glect it, when the general time of celebrating it is over. Many
have availed themselves of this expedient: and I am acquainted with a couple,
who are enraged at the New Style on another account; because it puts them to
double expences, by robbing them of the opportunity of keeping
<HI>Christmas</HI> Day and their Wedding Day at the same time.</P>
<P>AS to persons of fashion, this annual Carnival is worse to
them than Lent, or the empty town in the middle of sum∣mer. The boisterous
merriment, and aukward affectation of politeness among the vulgar, interrupts
the course of their refined pleasures, and drives them out of town for the
Holi∣days. <PB N="288" REF="295"/> The few who remain are very much at a loss
how to dispose of their time; for the theatres at this season are
opened only for the reception of school-boys and appren∣tices, and there is
no public place where a person of fashion can appear, without being
surrounded with the dirty inha∣bitants of <HI>St. Giles</HI>'s, and the
brutes from the <HI>Wapping</HI> side of <HI>Westminster.</HI> These
unhappy sufferers are really to be pitied; and since <HI>Christmas</HI>
day has to persons of distinc∣tion a great deal of insipidity about it, I
cannot enough ap∣plaud an ingenious lady, who sent cards round to all her
acquaintance, inviting them to a route; which they de∣clared was the happiest
thought in the world, because <HI>Christmas</HI> Day is so like
Sunday.</P>

<LETTER>
<HEAD>To Mr. TOWN.</HEAD>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">C</SEG>ONTESTED Elections and Double Returns being at present the
general topic of dis∣course, a subject in which the ladies me∣thinks are
but little concerned, I have a Scheme to propose to you in their behalf,
which I doubt not but you, as their professed patron, will use your
eloquence to recommend, and your authority to enforce. It has long been a
matter of real concern to <PB N="290" REF="297"/> every well-wisher to the
fair sex, that the men should be allowed the free choice of
representatives, to whom they can make every real or pretended grievance
known, while the women are deprived of the same privilege; when in reality
they have many grievances utterly unknown and unthought of by the men, and
which cannot be redressed but by a FEMALE PARLIAMENT.</P>
<P>I DO not, indeed, pretend to the honour of first pro∣jecting
this Scheme, since an Assembly of this nature has been proposed before:
but as it appears to me so necessary, I would advise that writs be
immediately issued out for calling a Parliament of Women, which for the
future should assem∣ble every winter, and be dissolved every
<HI>third</HI> year. My rea∣son for shortening the time of their sitting
proceeds from the reflection, that full as much business will be done, at
least as many speeches will be made, by women in three years, as by men in
seven. To this Assembly every county and city in <HI>England</HI> shall
send two members; but from this privilege I would utterly exclude every
borough, as we shall presently see that they can have no business to
transact there. But as I would have their number at least equal to that of
the other Parliament, the deficiency should be sup∣plied by the squares
and great streets at the court end of the town, each of which should be
represented by one of their own inhabitants. In humble imitation of the
Houses of Lords and Commons, the ladies of peers (whether spiri∣tual or
temporal) should sit here in their own right, the others by election only;
any woman to be qualified, whose husband, or even whose father (for I
would by no means exclude the unmarried ladies) are qualified to be chosen
into the other. In the same manner, whatever entitles the hus∣band or
father to vote at that election, should entitle his wife or daughter to vote
at this.</P>
<P><PB N="291" REF="298"/>HAVING settled this point, it now
remains to adjust the subjects which they are to treat of; and these we
shall find to be indeed of the last importance. What think you, Sir, of the
rise and fall of fashions, of as much con∣sequence to them as the rise
and fall of kingdoms is to us? of the commencing a new acquaintance, equivalent
to our making a new alliance? and the ceremonial of a route or a ball, as
interesting as the preliminaries of a treaty or a congress? These
subjects, and these alone, will sufficiently employ them every
sessions; and as their judgment must be final, how delightful will it
be to have bills brought in to determine how many inches of the leg or neck may
law∣fully be expos'd, how many curtesies at a public place amount to an
acquaintance, and what are the precise privileges of birth or fortune, that
entitle the possessors to give routs or drums, on week-days or on
sundays. Whoever should pre∣sume to transgress against these
laws, might be punished suitably to their offences: and be banished from
public places, or be condemned to do penance in linsey-woolsey: or if any
female should be convicted of immodesty, she might be outlawed, and then
(as these laws would not bind the nymphs of <HI>Drury)</HI> we should
easily distinguish a <HI>modest woman</HI> as the phrase is, if not
by her looks, at least by her dress and appearance, and the victorious
<HI>Fanny</HI> might then be suffer'd to strike bold strokes without
rivalry or imitation. If any man too should be found so grosly of∣fending
against the laws of fashion as to refuse a member a bow at a play or a
salute at a wedding, how suitably would he be punished by being
reprimanded on his knees in such an assembly, and by so fine a woman as
we may suppose the speaker would be? Then doubtless would a grand
committee sit on the affair of hoops; and were they established in their
present form by proper authority, doors <PB N="292" REF="299"/> and boxes
might be alter'd and enlarg'd accordingly. Then should we talk as familiarly
of the visit bill as of the mar∣riage bill, and with what pleasure should
we peruse the regulations of the committee of dress? Every lover of
de∣corum would be pleased to hear that refractory females were taken into
custody by the usher of the black fan: The double return of a visit would
occasion as many debates as the dou∣ble return for a certain county, and at
the eve of an election how pretty would it be to see the ladies of the
shire going about mounted on their white palfreys and canvassing for
votes.</P>
<P>TILL this great purpose is attain'd, I see not how the
visible enormities in point of dress, and failures in point of ceremony can
effectually be prevented. But then, and not before, I shall hope to see
politeness and good breeding di∣stinguished from formality and
affectation, and dresses in∣vented that will improve, not diminish the
charms of the fair, and rather become than disguise the wearers.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>I am, Sir, Yours, &amp;c. TIMOTHY
CANVAS.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>I AM much obliged to my correspondent for his letter, and
heartily wish that this Scheme was carried into execu∣tion. The liberties
daily taken in point of dress demand proper restrictions. The ancients
settled the national habit by law: but the dress of our own country is so
very fluctua∣ting, that if the great grandmothers of the present generation
were to arise, they would not be able to guess at their posterity from
their dress, but would fancy themselves in a strange country. As these
affairs fall more immediately under the cognizance of the ladies, the female
world in general would soon be sensible of the advantages accruing from a
female parliament: and tho' ladies of fashion might <PB N="293" REF="300"/>
probably claim some peculiar liberties in dress by their privilege, it
might naturally be expected that this wise assembly would at least keep
the rest of the sex in order; nor suffer enormous hoops to spread
themselves across the whole pavement, to the detriment of all honest men
going upon business along the street; nor permit the chandler's wife to
retail half-quarterns from behind the counter, in a short stomacher and
without an hankerchief.</P>
<P>I AM aware that a considerable objection may be brought
against this Scheme: to wit, that a Female Parliament (like those of the
men) may be subject to corruption, and be made dependant on a court. The
enormous <HI>Eliza∣beth</HI> Ruff, and the aukward Queen of <HI>Scots</HI> Mob,
are fatal instances of the evil influence which courts have upon fashions:
and as no one can tell the power which a <HI>British</HI> Queen might have
over the councils of a Female Parliament, future ages might perhaps see the
stays bolstered out into hump-backs, or the petticoats let down to conceal
a bandy leg, from the same servile complaisance which warped the necks of
<HI>Alexander</HI>'s courtiers.</P>
<P>BUT though a Parliament on the foregoing scheme has not yet
taken place, an institution of the like nature has been contrived among the
order of females, who (as I mentioned in a former paper) advertise for
gentlemen to <HI>play at cards</HI> with them. The reader may remember, that
some time ago an advertisement appeared in the public papers, from the
<HI>Covent-Garden</HI> Society; in which it was set forth, that one of their
members was voted <HI>common.</HI> This very society is composed of these
Agreeable Young Ladies, whole business it is to <HI>play at cards</HI> with
those gen∣tlemen, who have good-nature and fortune sufficient to sit down
contented with being losers. It is divided, like the <PB N="294" REF="301"/>
upper and lower Houses of Parliament, into <HI>Ladies</HI> and
<HI>Commons.</HI> The upper order of <HI>Card-players</HI> take their seats
according to the rank of those who game at high stakes with them; while the
<HI>Commons</HI> are made up of the lower sort of gamblers within the
hundreds of <HI>Drury</HI> and <HI>Covent-Garden.</HI> Every one is obliged to
pay a certain tax out of her <HI>Card-money</HI>; and the revenue arising
from it is applied to the levying of hoop-petticoats, sacks, petenlairs,
caps, handkerchiefs, aprons, &amp;c. to be issued out nightly according to
the exigence and degree of the members. Many revo∣lutions have happened in this
society since its institution: A <HI>Commoner</HI> in the space of a
few weeks has been called up to the House of Ladies; and another, who at
first sat as Peeress, has been suddenly degraded, and voted
<HI>common.</HI></P>
<P>MORE particulars of this Society have not come to my knowledge:
but their design seems to be, to erect a Com∣mon Wealth of themselves,
and to rescue their liberties from being invaded by those who have
presumed to tyrannize over them. If this practice of playing their own cards,
and shuff∣ling for themselves, should generally prevail among all the
Agreeable Young Gamesters of <HI>Covent-Garden,</HI> I am con∣cerned to think
what will become of the venerable sisterhood of <HI>Douglass,
Haddocks,</HI> and <HI>Noble,</HI> as well as the fraternity of <HI>Harris,
Derry,</HI> and the rest of those gentlemen, who have hitherto acted as
Groom-Porters, and had the principal di∣rection of the game. From such a
combination it may greatly be feared, that the honourable profession of
Pimp will in a short time become as useless as that of a
Fleet-Parson.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE last sessions deprived us of the only surviving
member of a Society, which (dur∣ing its short existence) was equal both in
principles and practice to the <HI>Mohocks</HI> and <HI>Hell Fire Club</HI> of
tremendous memory. This Society was composed of a few broken gamesters and
des∣perate young rakes, who threw the small remains of their bankrupt
fortunes into one common stock, and thence as∣sumed the name of the
Last Guinea Club. A short life and a merry one was their favourite maxim;
and they de∣termined, when their finances should be quite exhausted, to die
as they had lived, like gentlemen. Some of their <PB N="296" REF="303"/> members
had the good luck to get a reprieve by a good run at cards, and others by
snapping up a rich heiress or a dowager; while the rest, who were not cut
off in the natural way by duels or the gallows, very resolutely made their
<HI>quietus</HI> with laudanum or the pistol. The last that remained of
this Society had very calmly prepared for his own execution: he had cocked his
pistol, deliberately placed the muzzle of it to his temple, and was just
going to pull the trigger, when he bethought himself that he could employ it
to better purpose upon <HI>Hounslow Heath.</HI> This brave man, however,
had but a very short respite, and was obliged to suffer the ignominy of
going out of the world in the vulgar way by a halter.</P>
<P>THE enemies of play will perhaps consider those gentle∣men,
who boldly stake their whole fortunes at the gaming-table, in the same view
with these desperadoes; and they may even go so far as to regard the
polite and honourable assembly at <HI>White</HI>'s as a kind of Last
Guinea Club. No∣thing, they will say, is so fluctuating as the property of
a gamester, who (when luck runs against him) throws away whole acres at
every cast of the dice, and whose houses are as unsure a
possession, as if they were built with cards. Many, indeed, have been
reduced to their last guinea at this gen∣teel gaming-house: but the most
inveterate enemies to <HI>White</HI>'s must allow, that it is but now and
then, that a gamester of quality, who looks upon it as a toss-up whether
there is another world, takes his chance, and dispatches him∣self, when the
odds are against him in this.</P>
<P>BUT however free the gentlemen of <HI>White</HI>'s may be from
any imputation of this kind, it must be confessed that Suicide begins to
prevail so generally, that it is the most gallant exploit, by which our
modern heroes chuse to signalize themselves; and in this, indeed, they
behave with uncommon prowess. From the days of <HI>Plato</HI> down to 
<PB N="297" REF="304"/> these a Suicide has always been compared to a
soldier on guard deserting his post; but I should rather consider a
set of these desperate men, who rush on certain death, as a body of
troops sent out on the Forlorn Hope. They meet every face of death, however
horrible, with the utmost resolution: some blow their brains out with a
pistol; some expire like <HI>Socrates,</HI> by poisons; some fall, like
<HI>Cato,</HI> on the point of their own swords; and others, who have lived
like <HI>Nero,</HI> affect to die like <HI>Seneca,</HI> and bleed to death. The
most exalted geniusses I ever remember to have heard of, were a party of
reduced gamesters, who bravely resolved to pledge each other in a bowl of
laudanum. I was also lately informed of a gentleman, who went among his
usual companions at the gaming-table the day before he made away with
himself, and coolly questioned them, which they thought the easiest and
genteelest method of going out of the world: for there is as much difference
between a mean person and a man of quality in their manner of de∣stroying
themselves, as in their manner of living. The poor sneaking wretch,
starving in a garret, tucks himself up in his list garters; a second,
crost in love, drowns himself, like a blind puppy, in <HI>Rosamond's
Pond;</HI> and a third cuts his throat with his own razor. But the man of
fashion al∣most always dies by a pistol; and even the cobler of any
spirit goes off by a dose or two extraordinary of gin.</P>
<P>BUT this false spirit of courage, however noble it may
appear to the desperate and abandoned, in reality amounts to no more than the
resolution of the highwayman, who shoots himself with his own pistol,
when he finds it impossible to avoid being taken. All possible means
therefore should be devised to extirpate such absurd bravery, and to
make it appear every way horrible, odious, contemptible, and ridi∣culous. From
reading the public prints a foreigner might be naturally led to imagine, that
we are the most lunatic <PB N="298" REF="305"/> people in the whole world.
Almost every day informs us, that the coroner's inquest has sat on the
body of some mise∣rable Suicide, and brought in their verdict
<HI>Lunacy</HI>; but it is very well known that the inquiry has not been made
into the state of mind of the deceased, but into his fortune and family.
The law has indeed provided, that the deliberate Self-Murderer should be
treated like a brute, and denied the rites of burial: but among hundreds of
<HI>lunatics by purchase,</HI> I never knew this sentence executed but on
one poor cobler who hanged himself in his own stall. A pennyless poor dog
who has not left enough to defray the funeral charges, may perhaps be excluded
the church-yard; but Self-murder by a pistol genteely mounted, or the
<HI>Paris</HI>-hilted sword qualifies the polite owner for a <HI>sudden
death,</HI> and entitles him to a pom∣pous burial, and a monument setting
forth his virtues in <HI>Westminster Abbey.</HI> Every man in his sober
senses must wish that the most severe laws that could possibly
be contrived were enacted against Suicides. This shocking bravado never did
(and I am confident never will) prevail among the more deli∣cate and tender
sex in our own nation: tho' history informs us that the <HI>Roman</HI>
Ladies were once so infatuated as to throw off the softness of their
nature, and commit violence on them∣selves, 'till the madness was curbed by
exposing their naked bodies in the public streets. This, I think, would
afford a hint for fixing the like marks of ignominy on our Male-Suicides, and I
would have every lower wretch of this sort dragged at the cart's tail, and
afterwards be hung in chains at his own door, or have his quarters put up
<HI>in terrorem</HI> in the most public places as a rebel to his Maker. But
that the Suicide of quality might be treated with more respect, he should
be indulged in having his wounded corpse and shat∣tered brains lay (as it
were) in state for some days, of which dreadful spectacle we may conceive
the horror from the fol∣lowing picture drawn by <HI>Dryden.</HI> 
<Q> 
<L>The SLAYER OF HIMSELF too saw I there:</L> 
<L>The gore congealed was clotted in his hair:</L> 
<L>With eyes half-closed, and mouth wide ope he lay,</L> 
<L>And grim as when he breathed his sullen soul away.</L> 
<BIBL>DRYDEN's FABLES.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P><PB N="299" REF="306"/>THE common murderer has his skeleton
preserved at <HI>Surgeon's Hall</HI> in order to deter others from being
guilty of his crimes; and I think it would not be improper to have a
charnel-house set apart to receive the bones of these more unnatural
Self-Murderers, in which monuments should be erected giving an account of
their deaths, and adorned with the glorious ensigns of their rashness,
the rope, the knife, the sword, or the pistol.</P>
<P>THE cause of these frequent self-murders among us has been
generally imputed to the peculiar temperature of our climate. Thus a dull day
is looked upon as a natural order of execution, and <HI>Englishmen</HI>
must necessarily shoot, hang, and drown themselves in
<HI>November.</HI> That our spirits are in some measure influenced by the
air cannot be denied, but we are not such meer Barometers as to be driven to
des∣pair and death by the small degree of gloom that our winter brings with
it. If we have not so much sunshine as some countries in the world, we
have infinitely more than many others, and I do not hear that men dispatch
themselves by dozens in <HI>Russia</HI> or <HI>Sweden,</HI> or that they
are unable to keep up their spirits even in the total darkness of
<HI>Greenland.</HI> Our climate exempts us from many diseases to which
other more southern nations are naturally subject, and I can never be
persuaded that being born near the North-pole is a physical cause for
Self-Murder.</P>
<P>DESPAIR indeed is the natural cause of these shocking
actions; but this is commonly despair brought on by wilful extravagance and
debauchery. These first involve men in difficulties, and then death at once
delivers them of their lives and their cares. For my part, when I see a young
profligate wantonly squandering his fortune in bagnios or at the
gaming-table, I cannot help looking on him as hastening his own death, and in
a manner digging his own grave. As he is at last induced to kill himself by
motives arising from his vices, I consider him as dying of some
disease, which those vices naturally produce. If his extravagance has
been chiefly in luxurious eating and drinking, I imagine him poisoned by his
wines, or surfeited by a favourite dish; and if he has thrown away his
estate in bawdy-houses, I conclude him destroyed by rottenness and
filthy diseases.</P>
<P><PB N="300" REF="307"/>ANOTHER principal cause of the frequency
of Suicide is the noble spirit of Freethinking which has diffused itself
among all ranks of people. The libertine of fashion has too refined a taste
to trouble himself at all about a soul or an hereafter: but the vulgar
infidel is at wonderful pains to get rid of his bible, and labours to
persuade himself out of his religion. For this purpose he attends
constantly at the dis∣putant societies, where he hears a great deal about
free will, free agency, and predestination, 'till at length he is convinced
that man is at liberty to do as he pleases, lays his misfortunes to the
charge of providence, and comforts himself that he was inevitably destined
to be tyed up in his own garters. The courage of these heroes proceeds from
the same principles whether they fall by their own hands, or those of
<HI>Jack Ketch:</HI> The Suicide of whatever rank looks death in the face
with∣out shrinking; as the gallant rogue affects an easy unconcern under
<HI>Tyburn,</HI> throws away the psalm-book, bids the cart drive off with an
oath, and swings like a gentleman.</P>
<P>IF this madness should continue to grow more and more
epidemical, it will be expedient to have a Bill of Suicide, distinct from the
common bill of mortality, brought in yearly, in which should be set down
the number of Suicides, their methods of destroying themselves, and the
likely causes of their doing so. In this, I believe, we should find but
few martyrs to the weather, but their deaths would commonly be imputed to
despair, produced by some causes similar to the following. In the
little sketch of a Bill of Suicide under∣neath, I have left blanks for the
date of the year, as well as for the number of Self-Murderers, their manner of
dying, &amp;c. which would naturally be filled up by the proper persons if
ever this scheme should be put in execution.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="body of issue">
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">S</SEG>INCE pleasure is almost the only pursuit of a fine
gentleman, it is very necessary, for the maintaining his consequence and
cha∣racter, that he should have a girl in keep∣ing. Intriguing with women of
fashion, and debauching tradesmen's daughters, naturally happen in the
common course of gallantry; but this convenient fe∣male, to fill up the
intervals of business, is the principal mark of his superior taste and
quality. Every priggish clerk to an attorney, or pert apprentice can throw
away his occa∣sional guinea in <HI>Covent-Garden</HI>; but the shortness
of their <PB N="302" REF="309"/> finances will not permit them to persevere in
debauchery with the air and spirit of a man of quality. The Kept
Mi∣stress (which those half-reprobates dare not think of) is a constant
part of the retinue of a complete fine gentleman, and is, indeed, as
indispensible a part of his equipage, as a <HI>French valet de chambre</HI>
or a four-wheeled post-chaise.</P>
<P>IT was formerly the fashion among the ladies to keep a monkey:
At that time every woman of quality thought herself obliged to follow the
mode; and even the merchants wives in the city had their fashionable pugs to
play tricks and break china. A Girl in Keeping is as disagreeable to some
of our men of pleasure, as pug was to some ladies; but they must have one
to spend money and do mischief, that they may be reckoned young fellows of
spirit. Hence it happens, that many gentlemen maintain girls, who in fact are
little more than their nominal mistresses; for they see them as
seldom, and behave to them with as much indif∣ference as if they were their
wives: however, as the woman in a manner bears their name, and is maintained by
them, they may appear in the world with the genteel character of a Keeper. I
have known several gentlemen take great pains to heighten their reputation in
this way; and turn off a first mistress, merely because she was not
sufficiently known, for the sake of a celebrated woman of the town, a
dancer, or an actress: and it is always the first step of an
<HI>Englishman</HI> of fashion after his arrival at <HI>Paris,</HI> to take
one of the <HI>Filles d' Opera</HI> under his protection. It was but the other
day, that <HI>Florio</HI> went abroad, and left his girl to roll about the town
in a chariot, with an unlimited order on his banker; and almost as soon as
he got to <HI>France,</HI> took a smart girl off the stage, to make as
genteel a figure at <HI>Paris.</HI> In short, as a gentleman keeps running
horses, goes to <HI>White</HI>'s, and gets into parliament, for the name of
the <PB N="303" REF="310"/> thing; so must he likewise have his Kept
Mistress, because it is the fashion: and I was mightily pleased with
hearing a gentleman once boast, that he lived like a man of
quality—For, says he, I have a post-chaise and never ride in it, I
have a wife and never see her, and I keep a mistress and never lie with
her.</P>
<P>BUT if these sort of Keepers, who never care a farthing for
their mistresses, are to be laughed at, those who are really fond of
their <HI>Dulcineas</HI> are to be pitied. The most hen-pecked husband,
that ever bore the grievous yoke of a shrew, is not half so miserable, as
a man who is subject to the humours and unaccountable caprice of a cunning
slut, who finds him in her power. Her behaviour will continu∣ally give him
new occasion of jealousy; and perhaps she will really dispense her
favours to every rake in town, that will bid up to her price. She will smile
when she wants money, be insolent when she does not, and in short leave
no artifice untried, to plague his heart, and drain his pocket. A friend of
mine used constantly to rail at the slavish condi∣tion of married men,
and the tyranny of petticoat-government: he therefore prudently resolved to
live an uncontrouled batchelor, and for this reason pitched upon a country
girl, who should serve him as an handmaid. Determining to keep her in a
very snug and retired manner, he had even calcu∣lated how much she would
save him in curtailing his ordinary expences at taverns and bagnios: but this
scheme of oeconomy did not last long; for the artful jade soon contrived 
<Q REND="inline">"to wind her close into his easy heart,"</Q>
and inveigled him to maintain her in all the splendor and <HI>eclat</HI> of a
first rate lady of pleasure. He at first treated her with all the
indifference of a fashionable husband; but as soon as she found
herself to be entire mistress of his affections, it is surprising to
think what pains she took, to bring him to the most abject compliance 
<PB N="304" REF="311"/> with all her whimsies, and to tame him to the patient
thing he now is. A frown on his part would frequently cost him a brocade, and
a tear from her was sure to extort a new hand∣kerchief or an apron. Upon any
slight quarrel—O she would leave him that moment;—and though
the baggage had more cunning than to hazard an intrigue with any one else,
she would work upon his jealousy by continually twit∣ting him
with—She knew a gentleman, who would scorn to use her so
barbarously,—and she would go to him, if she could be sure she
was not with child.—This last circum∣stance was a <HI>coup de
reserve,</HI> which never failed to bring about a reconciliation: nay, I have
known her make great use of breeding qualms upon occasion; and things were
once come to such an extremity, that she was even forced to have recourse
to a sham miscarriage to prevent their separation. He has been often
heard to declare, that if he ever had a child by her, it should take its
chance at the <HI>Foundling Hos∣pital.</HI> He had lately an opportunity of
putting this to a trial: but the bare hinting of such a barbarous design
threw the lady into hysterics. However, he was determined, that the babe, as
soon as it was born, should be put out to nurse,—he hated the
squall of children. Well! madam was brought to bed: she could not bear the
dear infant out of her sight; and it would kill her not to suckle it
herself. The father was therefore obliged to comply; and an acquaintance
caught him the other morning, stirring the pap, holding the clouts before the
fire, (and in a word) dwindled into a mere nurse. Such is the transformation
of this <HI>Kind Keeper,</HI> whose character is still more ridiculous than
that of a <HI>Fondle-wife</HI> among husbands. The amours, indeed, of these
fond souls commonly end one of these two ways: they either find
themselves deserted by their mistress, when she has effectu∣ally
ruined their constitution and estate; or after as many years cohabitation,
as would have tired them of a wife, they <PB N="305" REF="312"/> grow so
doatingly fond of their whore, that by marriage they make her an honest
woman, and perhaps a lady of quality.</P>
<P>THE most unpardonable sort of Keepers are Married Men, and
Old Men. I will give the reader a short sketch of each of these
characters, and leave him to judge for him∣self. <HI>Cynthio</HI> about two
years ago was married to <HI>Clarinda,</HI> one of the finest women in the
world. Her temper and dis∣position was as agreeable as her person, and
her chief endea∣vour was to please her husband. But <HI>Cynthio</HI>'s
folly and va∣nity soon got the better of his constancy and gratitude, and
it was not six months after his marriage, before he took a girl he was
formerly acquainted with into keeping. His dear <HI>Polly</HI> uses him like
a dog, and he is cruel enough to revenge the ill-treatment he receives from her
upon his wife. He seldom visits her, but when his wench has put him out of
humour, and once, though indeed unknowingly, communi∣cated to her a filthy
disease, for which he was obliged to his mistress. Yet is he still
so infatuated as to doat on this vile hussy, and wishes it in his power
to annul his marriage, and legitimate his bastards by <HI>Polly.</HI> Yet is
it palpable to every one but <HI>Cynthio,</HI> that <HI>Polly</HI> has no
attraction but the name of Mistress, and <HI>Clarinda</HI> no fault but
being his wife.—Sir <HI>Thrifty Gripe</HI> is arrived at his Grand
Climac∣teric, and has just taken a girl into keeping. Till very lately the
multiplication-table was his rule of life, and 
<Q REND="inline">"a penny saved is a penny got"</Q> was his
favourite maxim. But he has suddenly deserted <HI>Wingate</HI> for
<HI>Rochester,</HI> and the <HI>Change</HI> for <HI>Covent-Garden.</HI> Here
he met with the buxom <HI>Charlotte,</HI> who at once opened his heart and his
purse, and soon begun to scatter his guineas in paying her debts, and
supply∣ing her fresh expences. Her equipage is as genteel and ele∣gant as
that of a dutchess, and the wise men in the alley shake their heads at
Sir <HI>Thrifty</HI> as the greatest spendthrift in town. Sir
<HI>Thrifty</HI> was formerly married to a merchant's daughter who brought him
a fortune of 20,000 l. but after she had two sons by him, he sent her
into the North of <HI>Wales</HI> to live cheap, and prevent the probable
expence of more children. His sons were obliged to an uncle for education, 
<PB N="306" REF="313"/> and Sir <HI>Thrifty</HI> now scarce allows them enough
to support them. His mistress and he almost always appear together at
public places, where she constantly makes a jest of him, while the old
dotard dangles at her elbow, like <HI>January</HI> by the side of
<HI>May.</HI> Thus Sir <HI>Thrifty</HI> lives, cursed by his own sons,
jilted by his mistress, and laughed at by the rest of the world.</P>
<P>IT is very diverting to observe the shifts to which
persons in middling or low life are reduced, in order to bear this new
incumbrance with which they sometimes chuse to load them∣selves. The
extravagances of a girl has put many a clerk on defrauding his master, sent
many a distressed gentleman's watch to the pawnbroker's, and his cloaths
to <HI>Monmouth Street,</HI> as well as the poor gentleman himself to the
gaming-table, or perhaps to <HI>Hounslow Heath.</HI> I know a templar who
always keeps a girl for the first month after he receives his allowance, when
his poverty obliges him to discard her, and live on mutton-chops and porter
for the rest of the quarter: and it was but lately that my mercer
discovered his appren∣tice to be concerned with two others in an
association for maintaining one trull common to the whole three.</P>
<P>THIS review of one of the chief sources of extravagance in the
higher and middling walks of life will help us in ac∣counting for the frequent
mortgages and distresses in families of fashion, and the numerous
bankruptcies in trade. Here also I cannot help observing that in this
case the misbehaviour of the women is in great measure to be charged to
the men; for how can it be expected that a lady should take any plea∣sure
in discharging the domestic duties of a wife, when she sees her
husband's affections placed abroad. Nothing indeed can be advanced in
vindication of loose conduct in the fair sex, but, considering our modern
morals, it is surely not much to be wondered at, when the husband openly
affronts his family by keeping a wench, if the wife also takes care to
provide herself a gallant.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> AM persuaded that my readers will agree with me in thinking
that the writers of the following letters ought to change cloaths; since, as
the case stands at present, the one seems to be a Pretty Miss in
breeches, and the other a Blood in petticoats.</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>To Mr. TOWN.</HEAD>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>SIR!</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ROCKS, desarts, wilds, wastes, savages, and barba∣rians
make up the sum total of the odious country: I am just returned from a
visit there, and would not <PB N="308" REF="315"/> pass another three weeks
in the same way to be lord of the manor.</P>
<P>HAVING received frequent invitations from Sir <HI>Sampson
Fivebars,</HI> and having heard much of the beauty of his three sisters, in
an evil hour I took a resolution to sacrifice this <HI>Christmas</HI> to
him at his seat in <HI>Wiltshire.</HI> I flattered myself with the hopes
that the novelty and oddness of the scene would serve me at least to
laugh at, and that if the rustics were not mere stocks and stones, my
cloaths and discourse would have taught them to talk and dress like human
crea∣tures. Need I tell you that I was disappointed? Sir <HI>Sampson</HI>
is what the country people call a hearty man. He has the shape and
constitution of a porter, and is sturdy enough to encounter
<HI>Broughton</HI> without mufflers; 
<Q REND="inline">"when he speaks, thunder breaks;"</Q> he
hunts almost every morning, and takes a toast and tankard for his
breakfast. You may easily imagine, that what was pleasure to him must
be torture to me; and indeed I would as soon draw in a mill, or carry a chair
for my diversion, as follow any of their horrid country amusements. But Sir
<HI>Sampson</HI> out of his abundant good-nature insisted on lending me a
gun, and showing me a day's sport of shooting. For this purpose he
loaded me with a huge gun, threw a bag and pouch across my shoulders, and
made me look for all the world like <HI>Robinson Crusoe.</HI> After I had
followed him over three or four ploughed fields, a servant, who was with us,
hollowed out, <HI>Mark!</HI> when the Baronet's gun went off so suddenly
that it threw me into a swoon, and at last I could hardly be convinced that
Sir <HI>Sampson</HI> had shot nothing but a partridge.</P>
<P>AFTER this you will conclude that I was not to be pre∣vailed
on to hunt. Once indeed Miss <HI>Fanny</HI> did tempt me to accompany her on
a morning-ride, but even of this I <PB N="309" REF="316"/> heartily repented.
Miss <HI>Fanny,</HI> I found, valued neither hedge nor ditch, has the
strength of a chair-woman, and in short is more like <HI>Trulla</HI> in
<HI>Hudibras,</HI> or <HI>Boadicia</HI> in the play, than a woman of fashion.
Unluckily too the horse I rode was skittish and unruly; so that while I
was scampering after Miss <HI>Fanny</HI> a sudden start brought me to
the ground. I received no hurt, but the fall so fluttered my spirits, that
Miss <HI>Fanny</HI> was obliged to take me up behind her. When we arrived at
the house I was in the utmost confusion, for the booby servants stood
gaping and grinning at my distress, and Sir <HI>Sampson</HI> himself
told me, with a laugh as horrible as <HI>Caliban</HI>'s, that he would lend me
one of his maids to carry me out airing every morning.</P>
<P>BESIDES these and fifty other mortifications I could
scarce get any rest during the whole time I remained there: every other
morning I was constantly waked by the hungry knight, just returned from the
chace and bawling for dinner. My breakfast was what they called their
afternoon tea, at which I always assisted the ladies, for I should
infallibly have perished had I stayed in the hall amidst the jargon of
toasts and the fumes of tobacco. I thought indeed my time might be much more
agreeably employed in the parlour; but even here my disappointment was
grievous past expres∣sion. These fair ones, for such they were, were
hale indeed and ruddy, and having been always cooped up, like turkeys in a pen,
were really no better than <HI>belles sauvages,</HI> being totally ignorant
of the fashionable arts and languishing <HI>deli∣catesse</HI> of women
of fashion. Their cloaths were huddled on merely with a view to cover their
nakedness, and they had no notion that their eyes were given them for any
other purpose than to see, and what is more strange, to read, forsooth!
For my part, Mr. TOWN, unless a woman can use her eyes to more advantage, I
should as soon fall in <PB N="310" REF="317"/> love with my lap dog or my
monkey; and what constitutes the difference between a lady and her cookmaid
but her taste in dress? Mobs and handkerchiefs answer the end of
covering, but the main purpose of dress is to reveal. I really almost
begin to think that these awkard creatures were so stupid and
unaccountable as to have no design upon me. To complete the oddity of their
characters, these girls are constant at church, but never dreamt of
promoting an intrigue there; employ their whole time there in praying, never
heard of such things as cut fans, and are so attentive to the queer old put
of a preacher that they scarce look or listen to any one else. After
service too the doctor is always taken home to dinner, and is as constant
at table on Sunday as a roast sirloin and a plumb pudding.</P>
<P>BUT even with these unaccountable females, I thought I could
have passed my evenings tolerably if I could have got them to cards, which
have the charming faculty of rendering all women equally agreeable. But
these, I found, they were almost wholly unaccustomed to. I once indeed
heard the dear cards mentioned, and was in hopes of some∣thing like an
assembly. But what was my mortification! when instead of seeing half a
dozen card-tables &amp;c. set out, and Whist, Brag, or Lansquenet going
forward, I saw these strange women place themselves at a huge round
table with country girls and cherry-cheeked bumkins to play, according to
annual <HI>Christmas</HI> custom, at Pope Joan and
Snip-snap-snorum.</P>
<P>IT would be endless to recount the miseries I suffered
in those three weeks. Even the necessaries of life were denied me, and I
could scarce have been more at a loss among the <HI>Hottentots.</HI> Would
you think it, Sir? tho' this house had a family in it, and a family of
females too, not a drop of <PB N="311" REF="318"/> <HI>Benjamin</HI>-wash, nor
a dust of almond powder could be pro∣cured there, nor indeed in all the
parish; and I was forced to scrub my hands with filthy wash-ball, which
so ruined their complexion that laying in gloves will not recover them this
fortnight. Add to this that I never could dress for want of pomatum, so
that my hair was always in dishevelle, and I am sure I should not have
been known at the <HI>Dilettantì.</HI> At length, Sir! my snuff and
salts were pretty nigh ex∣hausted; and to add to my distress, I lost
my snuff-box. These losses, were irreparable there; not all the country
afforded such snuff and salts as mine, I could as soon live without
food as without either, and not a box could I touch but one of
<HI>Deard</HI>'s, and of my own chusing. So I hurried up to town, and being
just recovered from the fatigue of my journey I send you this, in hopes
that my woeful experience will deter all my friends from following a chase as
mad and hare-brained as any of Sir <HI>Sampson</HI>'s; since it is
impossible to exist a day there with tolerable ease, and neither wit
nor beauty are worth one pinch unless they are improved by a <HI>Town
Education.</HI></P>

<P>DID I know your christian name I would call you by it, to
show you at first setting out that I know the world, and was born and
bred in high life.</P>
<P>THE design of this epistle is to express to you the
uneasi∣ness that some of us women of spirit feel at being incum∣bered
with petticoats, and to convince you by our way of life that had we been men we
should have been Bucks of the First Head. Be assured however that
such of us as are <PB N="312" REF="319"/> unmarried are strictly virtuous.
We have indeed been accu∣sed of copying the dress of the nymphs of
<HI>Drury.</HI> And can any thing be invented more becoming? <HI>Fanny,</HI> it
must be owned has Taste. What so smart as a cocked hat? and who but
see's the advantages of short petticoats, unless it be some squire's
aukward daughter, who never yet heard of a <HI>Poloneze</HI> and never
accidentally shews her leg without blushing?</P>
<P>IT is true this similitude in dress now and then
occasions some droll mistakes. In the park the joke has been some∣times
carried so far I have been obliged to call the centry: and how did a young
templar start and stare when, having just made an appointment with him,
he saw me step into a chair adorned with coronets!</P>
<P>IF you frequent <HI>Ranelagh</HI> you must undoubtedly have
seen or heard me there. I am always surrounded with a croud of fellows, and
my voice and laugh is sure to be the loudest, especially while
<HI>Beard</HI> is singing. One is my <HI>dear</HI> lord, another my
<HI>sweet</HI> colonel, and the rest I call <HI>Tom,</HI> or <HI>Dick,</HI>
or <HI>Harry,</HI> as I would their footmen. At the play I always enter in the
first act. All the eyes of the house are turned upon me. I am quite
composed. Before I am settled the act is over, and to some I nod or
curtsy, with others I talk and laugh till the curtain falls.</P>
<P>WHAT would I give to change my sex! <HI>Entre nous,</HI> I
have a strong inclination to see the world in masquerade. If you love me,
keep it secret, and should you hear of any prank more wild and buckish
than usual, conclude it to be played by me in men's cloaths.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">N</SEG>OTHING is more natural than for the quacks of all
professions to recommend their wares to those persons who are most
likely to stand in need of them. Thus Mrs. <HI>Giles</HI> very properly
acquaints the fair sex, that she fells her fine compound for taking off
superfluous hairs at a guinea an ounce: and ladies of quality are
constantly informed, where they may be furnished with the newest
brocades, or the choicest variety of <HI>Chelsea</HI> China figures for
deserts. It is very necessary that the <HI>Beau Monde</HI> should be
acquainted that <HI>Eau de Luce</HI> is prepared here in <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> the
same as at <HI>Paris:</HI> but I must own I was very much surprised at
seeing repeated advertisements in the papers <PB N="314" REF="321"/> from
the Rich Cordial Warehouse, introduced by an address "TO THE PEOPLE OF
FASHION." I cannot but look upon this as a libel on our persons of
distinction, and I know not whether it may not be construed into
<HI>scandalum magnatum</HI>; as it tacitly insinuates, that our Right
Honour∣ables are no better than Dram-drinkers.</P>
<P>THERE is a well-known story of the famous <HI>Rabelais,</HI>
that having a mind to impose on the curiosity of his landlord, he filled
several vials with an innocent liquor, and directed them with—Poison
for the King,—Poison for the Dauphin,—Poison for the Prime
Minister,—and for all the principal courtiers. The same might be
said of these Rich Cordial Liquors, which however they may recommend
themselves to the People of Fashion by their foreign titles and extraction,
are to be considered as poisons in masquerade: and instead of the
pompous names of <HI>Eau d'Or, Eau Divine,</HI> and the like, I would have
labels fixed on the bottles (in imitation of <HI>Rabelais)</HI>
with—Poison for my Lord Duke,—Poison for the
Viscount,—Poison for the Countess.</P>
<P>WE live, indeed, in so polite an age, that nothing goes down
with us, but what is either imported from <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Italy,</HI>
or dignified with a foreign appellation. Our dress must be entirely
<HI>á la mode de Paris</HI>; and I will ven∣ture to ensure great
success to the <HI>Monsieur</HI> taylor, who tells us in the public
papers, that he has just been to <HI>France</HI> to see the newest
fashions. A dinner is not worth eating, if not served up by a
<HI>French</HI> cook; our wines are of the same country; and the
Dram-drinkers of Fashion comfort their spirits with Rich Cordials from
<HI>Chamberry, Neuilly,</HI> and <HI>l'Isle de Rhè.</HI> A plain man
must undoubtedly smile at the alluring names which are given to many of
them; nor is it <PB N="315" REF="322"/> possible to guess at their
composition from their title. The virtues, as well as the intent, of Viper
Water may be well known: but who would imagine, that <HI>Flora Granata,</HI> or
<HI>Belle de Nuit</HI> should be intended only to signify a dram? For my
own part I should rather have taken <HI>Marasquino</HI> for an
<HI>Italian</HI> fidler, and have concluded that <HI>Jacomonodi</HI> was no
other than an Opera-Singer.</P>
<P>BUT Dram-drinking, however different in the phrase, is the
same in the practice, in every station of life; and sipping Rich Cordials
is no less detestable, than in the vulgar idiom Bunging your Eye. What
signifies it, whether we meddle with <HI>Eau de Millefleurs</HI> or plain
aniseed? or whether we fetch our drams from the Rich Cordial Warehouse, or
the Blackamoor and Golden Still? The lady of St. <HI>James</HI>'s, who paints
her face with frequent applications of coffee or chocolate water, looks as
hideous as the trollop of St. <HI>Giles</HI>'s, who has laid on the same
colours by repeated half-quarterns of Gin Royal. There are many customs among
the Great, which are also practised by the lower sort of people: and if
persons of fashion must wrap up their drams in the disguise of a
variety of specious titles, in this too they are rivalled by the vulgar.
Madam Gin has been christened by as many names as a <HI>German</HI>
princess: every petty chandler's shop will sell you Sky-blue, and every
night-cellar furnish you with <HI>Holland</HI> Tape, three yards a penny. Nor
can I see the difference between <HI>Oil of Venus,</HI> Spirit of
<HI>Adonis,</HI> and <HI>Parfait Amour,</HI> for the use of our Quality, and
what among the vulgar is called <HI>Cupid's</HI> Eye-water, <HI>Strip me
naked,</HI> and <HI>Lay me down softly.</HI></P>
<P>TO these elegant and genteel appellations it is, indeed,
chiefly owing, that Drams are not confined merely to the vulgar, but are in
esteem among all ranks of people, and <PB N="316" REF="323"/> especially
among the ladies. Many a good woman, who would start at the mention of Strong
Waters, cannot conceive there can be any harm in a Cordial. And as the fair
sex are more particularly subject to a depression of spirits, it is
no wonder that they should convert their apothecaries shops into Rich
Cordial Warehouses, and take Drams by way of physick; as the common people
make Gin serve for meat, drink, and cloaths. The ladies perhaps may not be
aware that every time they have recourse to their Hartshorn or Lavender
Drops, to drive away the vapours, they in effect take a Dram; and they may be
assured, that their Cholic, Surfeit, and Plague Waters are to be ranked
among spiri∣tuous liquors, as well as the common stuff at the Gin-shop.
The College of Physicians, in their last review of the <HI>London</HI>
Dispensatory, for this very reason expelled the Strong Water generally
known by the soothing name of Hysteric Water; because it was a lure to
the female sex to dram it by autho∣rity, and to get tipsy <HI>secundum
artem.</HI></P>
<P>IF any of my fair readers have at all given into this
per∣nicious practice of Dram-drinking, I must intreat them to leave it off
betimes, before it has taken such hold of them, as they can never shake
off. For the desire of Drams steals upon them, and grows to be habitual, by
imperceptible degrees: as those, who are accustomed to take Opiates, are
obliged to encrease the dose gradually, and at last cannot sleep
without it. The following letter may serve to convince them of the deplorable
situation of a lady, who covers her drinking under the pretence of mending
her constitution.</P>

<SALUTE>Mr. TOWN!</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE the misfortune to be married to a poor sickly
creature, who labours under a complication of disorders, and which nothing
can relieve but a continued course of <PB N="317" REF="324"/> Strong Liquors;
though poor woman! she would not else touch a Dram for the world. Sometimes
she is vio∣lently troubled with the tooth-ach; and then she is o∣bliged to
hold a glass of Rum in her mouth, to numb the pain: at other times she is
seized with a racking fit of the cholic, and nothing will so soon give
her ease as some Right <HI>Holland</HI>'s Gin. She has the gout in her
constitution, and whenever she feels a twitch of it, the only thing is
sheer Brandy to keep it from her head: but this is sometimes too
<HI>cold</HI> for her, and she is forced to drive it out of her stomach
with true <HI>Irish</HI> Usquebaugh. She is never free from the vapours,
notwithstanding she is conti∣nually drinking Hartshorn and water: and
ever since she miscarried, she is so hysterical in the night time,
that she never lies without a Cordial-Water bottle by her bedside. I have
paid the apothecary about fifty pounds for her in one year, and his bill is
laced down with nothing but Drops, Pepper Mint Water, and the Cordial Draught
repeated.</P>
<P>HER very diet must always be made <HI>heartening,</HI>
other∣wise it will do her no good. Tea would make her low-spirited, except
she was to qualify every dish with a large spoonful of Rum. She has a
glass of Mountain with Bitters an hour before dinner to create an appetite:
and her stomach is so poor, that when she is at table, she must force
every bit down with a glass of Madeira. We usually have a tiff of punch
together in the evening: but the acid would gripe her, and the water keep her
awake all the night, if it was not made <HI>comfortable</HI> with more than an
equal portion of Spirit.</P>
<P>BUT notwithstanding the grievous complaints she hourly
labours under, she is very hale, and her complexion is, to 
<PB N="318" REF="325"/> all appearance, as healthy and florid, as a milk-maid's:
except indeed that her nose and forehead are subject to red pimples,
blotches, and breakings out, which the apothecary tells me are owing to a kind
of an acrimonious humour in her blood. For my part, considering the quantity
of combustibles she continually pours down, I should imagine the fire in
her stomach would kindle a flame in her countenance; and I should not
wonder if her face looked as horrible, as those who hang over a bowl of burnt
Brandy at Snap-Dragon.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE noblest exploit of a Man of the Town, the highest proof
and utmost effort of his genius and pleasantry is <HI>The</HI> FROLICK.
This piece of humour consists in playing the most wild and extravagant
pranks that wantonness and debauchery can suggest; and is the
dis∣tinguishing characteristic of the Buck and Blood. These facetious
gentlemen, whenever Champagne has put them in spirits, sally out 
<Q REND="inline">"flown with insolence and wine"</Q> in quest
of adventures. At such a time the more harm they do the more they shew
their wit; and their Fro∣licks, like the mirth of a monkey, are made up of
mischief.</P>
<P><PB N="320" REF="327"/>THE Frolick formerly signified nothing
more than a piece of innocent mirth and gaiety; but the modern sense of the
word is much more lively and spirited. The Mohocks and Hell Fire Club, the
heroes of the last generation, were the first who introduced these
elevated Frolicks, and struck out mighty good jokes from all kinds of
violence and blasphemy. The present race of Bucks commonly begin their
Frolick in a tavern, and end it in the round-house, and during the course
of it practise several mighty pretty pleasantries. There is a great deal
of humour in what is called <HI>beating the rounds,</HI> that is in plain
<HI>English,</HI> taking a tour of the principal bawdy-houses: breaking of
lamps and skirmishes with watchmen are very good jests; and the
insulting any dull sober fools that are quietly trudging about their
business, or a rape on a modest woman are particularly facetious.
Whatever is in violation of all decency and order is an exquisite piece of
wit, and in short a Frolick and <HI>playing the devil</HI> bear the same
explanation in a modern glossary.</P>
<P>IT is surprizing how much invention there is in these
exploits, and how wine inspires these gentlemen with thoughts more
extraordinary and sublime than any sober man could ever have devised. I
have known a whole com∣pany start from their chairs, and begin tilting at
each other merely for their diversion. Another time these exalted
geni∣usses have cast lots which should be thrown out of the win∣dow;
and at another make a bonfire of their cloaths and run naked into the
streets. I remember a little gentleman not above five feet high, who was
resolved, merely for the sake of the Frolick, to lie with the Tall Woman,
but the joke ended in his receiving a sound cudgelling from the hands of his
<HI>Thalestris.</HI> It was no longer ago than last winter that a party of
jovial Templars set out an hour or two after mid∣night <PB N="321" REF="328"/>
on a voyage to <HI>Lisbon</HI> in order to get good Port. They took boat at
the Temple-stairs, and prudently laid in by way of provisions a cold
venison pasty and two bottles of rasberry brandy: but when they imagined
themselves just arrived at <HI>Gravesend,</HI> they found themselves
suddenly over∣set in <HI>Chelsea</HI>-Reach, and very narrowly escaped
being drowned. The most innocent Frolicks of these men of humour are
carried on in a literary way by advertisements in the newspapers, with
which they often amuse the town; and alarm us with bottle-conjurors, and
persons who will jump down their own throats. Sometimes they divert
them∣selves by imposing on their acquaintance with fictitious in∣trigues,
and putting modest women to the blush by de∣scribing them in the publick
papers. Once, I remember, it was the Frolick to call together all the wet
nurses that want∣ed a place; at another time to summon several old women
to bring their male tabby cats, for which they were to expect a considerable
price; and not long ago, by the proffer of a curacy, they drew all the poor
parsons to St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s Coffee-house, where the Bucks themselves
sat in another box to smoke their rusty wigs and brown cassocks.</P>
<P>BUT the highest Frolick that can possibly be put in
execution is a genteel murder; such as running a waiter through the body,
knocking an old feeble watchman's brains out with his own staff, or taking
away the life of some re∣gular scoundrel, who has not spirit enough to
whore and drink like a gentleman. The noblest Frolick of this kind I ever
remember happened a few years ago at a country town. While a party of Bucks
were making a riot at an inn, and tossing the chairs and tables, and
looking-glasses into the street, the landlady was indiscreet enough to
come up stairs, and interrupt their merriment with her imperti∣nent
remonstrances; upon which they immediately threw <PB N="322" REF="329"/> her
out of the window after her own furniture. News was soon brought of the poor
woman's death, and the whole company looked upon it as a very droll accident,
and gave orders that she should be charged in the bill.</P>
<P>THESE wild pranks are instances of great spirit and
invention, but, alas! the generality of mankind have no taste for humour. Few
people care to have a sword in their ribs for the sake of the joke, or to
be beat to mummy or shot through the head for the diversion of the good
company. They sometimes imagine the jest is carried too far, and are apt to
apply the words of the old fable, 
<Q REND="inline">"It may be sport to you, but it is death to
us."</Q> For these reasons a set of these merry gentlemen are as
terrible to the ordinary part of the world as a troop of banditti; and an
affair which has been thought very high fun in. <HI>Pall Mall</HI> or
<HI>Covent Garden,</HI> has been treated in a very serious manner at
<HI>Westminster Hall</HI> or the <HI>Old Baily.</HI> Our legislature has
been absurd enough to be very careful of the lives of the lowest among the
people, and the council for a highwayman would sooner plead distress as
an excuse for discharging his pistol than mere wantonness and Frolick
Nor do the governments abroad entertain a better opinion of this sort of
humour; for it is but a few years, since a gentleman on his travels who was
compleating a Town Education by the polite tour, shot a waiter through the
head: but the joke was so ill received, that the gentleman was hanged within
four and twenty hours. It would be adviseable therefore for these
gentlemen, since the taste of the age is so incorrigible, to lay aside
this high-seasoned humour. For their pistol, as it were, recoils upon
them∣selves, and since it may produce their own deaths, it would be more
prudent not to draw their wit out of their scabbards.</P>
<P><PB N="323" REF="330"/>OUR Ladies of quality, who have at length
adopted <HI>French</HI> manners with <HI>French</HI> fashions, and thrown off
all starchness and reserve with the ruff and the farthingale, are very
fond of a Frolick. I have indeed lately observed with great pleasure the
commendable attempts of the other sex to shake of the shackles of
custom, and I make no doubt but a libertine lady will soon become a very
common character. If their passion for Gaming continues to encrease in
the same proportion that it has for some time past, we shall very
soon meet with abundance of sharpers in petticoats; and it will be
mentioned as a very familiar incident that a party of female gamblers were
siezed by the constables at the gaming-table. I am also informed that it
is grown very common among the ladies to toast pretty fellows; and that they
often amuse themselves with concerting schemes for an excellent Frolick.
A Frolick is indeed the most conve∣nient name in the world to veil an
intrigue, and it is a great pity that husbands and fathers should ever
object to it. I can see no harm in a lady's going disguised to mob it in
the gallery at the play-house; and could not but smile at the pretty
innocent wanton who carried the joke so far as to ac∣company a strange
gentleman to a bagnio; but when she came there, was surprized to find that
he was fond of a Frolick as well as herself, and offered her violence. But I
particularly admire the spirit of that lady, who had such true relish for
a Frolick, as to go with her gallant to the Masquerade, though she knew he
had no breeches under his Domino.</P>
<P>I MOST heartily congratulate the fine ladies and gentlemen of
the age on the spirit with which they persue their diversions; and I look
upon a bold Frolick as the peculiar privilege of a person of fashion. The
ladies undoubtedly see a great deal of pleasantry in an intrigue, and 
<PB N="324" REF="331"/> mimick the dress and manners of the courtezans very
hap∣pily and facetiously: while the gentlemen, among many other new fancies,
have made the old blunder of the Merry Andrew, appear no longer ridiculous, and
are mightily pleased with the <HI>comical humours of a murder.</HI> The
Fro∣licks now in vogue will probably continue to be the amuse∣ments of the
polite world for a long time; but whenever the fashion is about to vary, I
beg leave to propose the Frolick recommended, if I remember right, to the
Duke of <HI>Wharton</HI> by Dr. <HI>Swift.</HI> 
<Q REND="inline">"When you are tired of your other Frolicks, I
would have you take up the Frolick of BEING GOOD; and take my word for it, you
will find it the most agreeable Frolick you ever practised in your
life.</Q></P>

<DIV2 TYPE="body of issue">
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HERE once prevailed among us a sect called <HI>The</HI>
ADAMITES, whose doctrine, like that of our present <HI>Moravians,</HI> was
calcula∣ted to comfort the flesh as well as the spirit, and many things
generally accounted inde∣cent and immodest, were with them regarded as
principles of religion. The chief article maintained by this sect was, that
it was proper, like our great forefather <HI>Adam,</HI> to go naked; and the
proselytes to this faith came abroad in the public streets and open
daylight without any cloathing. But this primitive simplicity did not agree
with the notions of those degenerate days, and the ADAMITES were looked 
<PB N="326" REF="333"/> upon as an intolerable nusance. Their religion, like
all o∣thers, was soon attended with persecution; and some of the converts
were dragged naked to the cart's tail, some set in the stocks, and others
sent to <HI>Bridewell.</HI></P>
<P>SINCE that remarkable period the male part of our species have
been decently covered; but the female world has made several bold attempts to
throw off the incum∣brance of cloaths. Caps, handkerchiefs, tuckers, and
mo∣desty-pieces have been long discarded; and the ladies have continued
every year to shed some other part of their dress as useless and
unornamental. But these are only half asser∣tions of the female rights
and natural liberty, in com∣parison to the project, which, it is thought,
will be ripe for execution by summer. A set of ladies of the first
fashion have agreed to found a sect of <LB/>EVITES, <LB/>who are to appear in
public with no other covering than the original Fig-leaf. The primitive
simplicity of appear∣ance will be restored: and, though some may be
censorious enough to imagine that their confidence arises from very
different principles, it may very justly be said of our ladies of quality,
as of our first parents before the fall, 
<Q REND="inline">"They are naked, and <HI>are not
ashamed.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>MY country readers, and all those who live at a distance
from the polite world, may perhaps look upon this scheme as merely
fantastical and imaginary; but nothing is more true. The milliners are at
this time all very busy in making up artificial Fig-leaves, and adorning them
according to the different fancies of the wearers. There is more taste
dis∣played in contriving an elegant Fig-leaf, than has hitherto been exerted
in forming a genteel sword-knot. Some have <PB N="327" REF="334"/> bunches of
the gayest coloured ribbons dangling loosely from the stalk, others
tossels of gold and silver lace, and a few designed for ladies of the
highest distinction bunches of diamonds. This and the <HI>Pompon,</HI>
which it is said has been lately worn merely as a type of the Fig-leaf, will
make up the common dress of the whole female world: but if ever the weather
should be too severe for the ladies to appear (as <HI>Bayes</HI>
expresses it) <HI>in puris naturalibus,</HI> they are to wear
flesh-coloured silks with <HI>Pompons</HI> and Fig-leaves as usual.</P>
<P>THERE are perhaps persons who as they still retain some of
the leaven of decency in their composition, will be startled at this
project. I must own however that it does not appear to me to be in the
least extraordinary or surpri∣zing: for considering the present dress
of our women of fashion, there remains no further step to be taken except
absolute nakedness. The stays and petticoat have been so unmercifully
pruned and cut away in order to discover latent beauties, that if those of
the present mode were to fall into the hands of our distant posterity
they would conclude that the present race of women must have been a
generation of pigmies; for they could never possibly conceive that they
were of common size, and wore by way of dress any garments so little
calculated either for use or ornament. If one might judge by appearances, the
little modesty that is left in the polite world seems to be among the men;
and one is almost tempted to look for the rakes, and persons of intrigue in
the other sex. I was present a few nights ago at the repre∣sentation of
<HI>The Chances</HI>; and when I looked round the boxes and observed the
loose dress of all the ladies, and the great relish with which they
received the high-seasoned jests in that Comedy, I was almost
apprehensive that the old story of the outrage of the <HI>Romans</HI> on
the <HI>Sabine</HI> women would be inverted, and that the ladies would rise
up, and commit a rape on the men.</P>
<P><PB N="328" REF="335"/>BUT notwithstanding all that may be
said against this project for establishing nakedness, it is not
without example. Among the <HI>Hottentots,</HI> a very wise and polite
nation, the ladies at this day go quite naked, except a loose mantle thrown
over their shoulders, and a short apron before instead of a fig leaf. It
is also well known that the <HI>Spartans</HI> al∣lowed their unmarried women
to wear a sort of a loose robe, which at every motion discovered their
charms through se∣veral openings contrived for that purpose. There would
certainly be no harm in extending this liberty to the whole sex, and I am not
in the least inclined to listen to the malignant insinuations that when a
married woman endea∣vours to look particularly tempting, it is not merely to
please her husband, but to captivate a gallant. It may per∣haps be further
objected that our Northern climate is too cold to strip in: but this little
inconvenience is amply com∣pensated by the security the ladies will create
to themselves by taking such extraordinary liberties, and carrying matters
so very far that it will be indecent even to reprehend them.</P>
<P>THERE is however a very large part of the sex, for whom I am
greatly concerned on this occasion. I mean the Old and the Ugly. Whatever the
Belles may get by this fashion, these poor ladies will be great
sufferers. Their faces are already more than is agreeable to be shewn; but
if they expose sickly skins furrowed and pursed up like
washer∣women's fingers, the sight will become too disgusting. During
the present mode I have observed that the display of a yellow neck or
clumsy leg has created but few admirers: and it is reasonable to conclude
that when the new fashion begins to prevail universally, although our men
of pleasure will be glad to see the young and beautiful ladies, whom they
would desire to take into their arms, stripping as fast as possible,
yet they are not so fond of primitive and original <PB N="329" REF="336"/>
simplicity as to be captivated by a lady who has none of the charms of
<HI>EVE,</HI> except her nakedness.</P>
<P>SOME persons of more than ordinary penetration are apt to look
on this project in a political light, and consider it as a scheme to
counter-work the Marriage-Act. But as the chief ladies who concerted it are
already provided with hus∣bands, and are known to be very well affected to
the Government, this does not appear probable. It is more likely to be an
artifice of the Beauties to make their superi∣ority incontestible, by
drawing in the dowdies of the sex to suffer by such an injurious
contrast. However this may be, it is very certain that the most lovely of
the sex are about to employ the whole artillery of their charms against us,
and indeed seem resolved to shoot us flying. On this occasion it is to
be hoped that the practice of painting, which is now so very fashionable,
will be entirely laid a∣side: for whoever incrusts herself in paint can
never be al∣lowed to be naked; and it is surely more elegant for a lady to be
covered even with silk and linen, than to be daubed, like an old wall, with
plaister and rough-cast.</P>
<P>AFTER this account of the schemes of our modish fe∣males now
in agitation, which the reader may depend upon as genuine, it only remains to
let him know how I came by my intelligence. <HI>The</HI> PARLIAMENT OF WOMEN
lately proposed is now actually sitting. Upon their first meeting after
the preliminaries were adjusted, the whole house na∣turally resolved
itself into a Committee on the affairs of Dress. The Fig-leaf Bill, the
purport of which is contained in this paper, was brought in a by noble
Countess, and oc∣casioned some very warm debates. Two ladies in
particular made several remarkable speeches on this occasion: but 
<PB N="330" REF="337"/> they were both imagined to speak, like our male
patriots, more for their own private interest than for the good of the
Public. For one of these ladies, who insisted very earnestly on the
decency of some sort of covering, and has a very beautiful face, is
shrewdly suspected not to be so much above all rivalry in the turn and
proportion of her limbs: and the other, who was impatient to be undressed
with all expedition, was thought to be too much influenced by her known
partiality to a favourite mole, which now lays out of sight. The Bill however
was passed by a very considerable majority, and is intended to be put in
force by Midsummer Day next ensuing.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE idle superstitions of the vulgar are no where so
conspicuous as in the affairs of love. When a raw girl's brain is once turned
with a sweetheart, she converts every trifling accident of her life into a
good or bad omen, and makes every thing conspire to strengthen her in so
pleasing a delusion. <HI>Virgil</HI> represents <HI>Dido,</HI> as soon
as she has contracted her fatal passion for <HI>Aeneas,</HI> as going to
the priests to have her fortune told. In like manner the lovesick girl runs
to the cunning-man, or crosses the gipsy's <PB N="332" REF="339"/> hand
with her last sixpence, to know when she shall be married, how many
children she shall have, and whether she shall be happy with her
husband. She also consults the cards, and finds out her lover in the
Knave of Hearts. She learns how to interpret dreams, and every night
furnishes her with meditations for the next day. If she happens to bring
out any thing in conversation which another person was about to say,
she comforts herself that she shall be married before them; and if
she tumbles as she is running up stairs, imagines she shall go to
church with her sweet∣heart before the week is at an end. But if in the
course of their amour she gives the dear man her hair wove in a
True-lover's Knot, or breaks a crooked nine pence with him, she thinks
herself assured of his inviolable fidelity.</P>
<P>IT would puzzle the most profound antiquary to disco∣ver
what could give birth to the many strange notions che∣rished by fond nymphs
and swains. The God of Love has more superstitious votaries, and is
worshipped with more un∣accountable rites than any fabulous deity whatever.
Nothing indeed is so whimsical as the imagination of a person in love.
The dying shepherd carves the name of his mistress on the trees, while
the fond maid knits him a pair of garters with an amorous posey; and both
look on what they do as a kind of charm to secure the affection of the other.
A lover will rejoice to give his mistress a bracelet or a top∣knot, and
she perhaps will take pleasure in working him a pair of ruffles. These
they will regard as the soft bonds of love, but neither would on any account
run the risk of <HI>cutting love,</HI> by giving or receiving such a
present as a knife or a pair of scissars. But to wear the picture of
the beloved object constantly near the heart is universally accounted a
most excellent and never-failing preservative of affection.</P>
<P><PB N="333" REF="340"/>SOME few years ago there was publickly
advertised, a∣mong the other extraordinary medicines whose wonderful
qualities are daily related in the last page of our news∣papers, a most
efficacious love-powder; by which a despair∣ing lover might create affection
in the bosom of the most cruel mistress. Lovers have indeed always been
fond of enchantment. <HI>Shakespeare</HI> has represented <HI>Othello</HI>
as ac∣cused of winning his <HI>Desdemona</HI> by 
<Q REND="inline">"conjuration and mighty magic;"</Q> and
<HI>Theocritus</HI> and <HI>Virgil</HI> have both in∣troduced women into their
pastorals using charms and in∣cantations to recover the affection of their
sweethearts. In a word, Talismans, Genii, Witches, Fairies, and all the
instruments of magic and enchantment were first discovered by lovers, and
employed in the business of love.</P>
<P>BUT I never had a thorough insight into all this amorous
sorcery till I received the following letter, which was sent me from the
country, a day or two after <HI>Valentine</HI>'s Day, and I make no doubt but
all true lovers most religiously performed the previous rites mentioned by
my correspondent.</P>

<SALUTE>DEAR SIR!</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU must know I am in love with a very clever man, a
Londoner; and as I want to know whether it is my fortune to have him, I have
tried all the tricks I can hear of for that purpose. I have seen him
several times in Coffee-grounds with a sword by his side; and he was once
at the bottom of a Tea-cup in a coach and six with two footmen behind it. I
got up last May morning, and went into the fields to hear the cuckow; and
when I pulled off my left shoe, I found an hair in it exactly the 
<PB N="334" REF="341"/> same colour with his. But I shall never forget what
I did last Midsummer Eve. I and my two sisters tried the Dumb Cake
together: you must know, two must make it, two bake it, two break it, and
the third put it under each of their pillows, (but you must not speak a
word all the time) and then you will dream of the man you are to have. This we
did; and to be sure I did nothing all night, but dream of Mr.
<HI>Blossom.</HI> The same night, exactly at twelve o'clock, I sowed
Hempseed in our back yard, and said to myself, 
<Q REND="inline">"Hempseed I sow, Hempseed I hoe, and he
that is my true-love, come after me and mow."</Q> Will you be∣lieve me? I
looked back, and saw him behind me, as plain as eyes could see him. After
that, I took a clean shift, and turned it, and hung upon the back of a chair;
and very likely my sweetheart would have come and turned it right again, (for
I heard his step) but I was frightened, and could not help speaking, which
broke the charm. I likewise stuck up two Midsummer Men, one for myself,
and one for him. Now if his had died away, we should never have come
together: but I assure you he blowed and turned to me. Our maid
<HI>Betty</HI> tells me, that if I go backwards with∣out speaking a word into
the garden upon Midsummer Eve, and gather a Rose, and keep it in a clean
sheet of paper, without looking at it, till <HI>Christmas</HI> day, it will
be as fresh as in June; and if I then stick it in my bosom, he that is to
be my husband will come and take it out. If I am not married before the time
comes about again, I will certainly do it; and only mind if Mr.
<HI>Blossom</HI> is not the man.</P>
<P>I HAVE tried a great many other fancies, and they have all
turned out right. Whenever I go to lye in a strange bed, I always tye my
garter nine times round the bed-post, and <PB N="335" REF="342"/> knit nine
knots in it, and say to myself, <HI>This knot I knit, this knot I tye, To
see my love as he goes by, In his apparel and array, As he walks in every
day.</HI> I did so last holidays at my uncle's; and to be sure I saw
Mr. <HI>Blossom</HI> draw my cur∣tains and tuck up the cloaths at my bed's
feet. Cousin <HI>Debby</HI> was married a little while ago, and she sent
me a piece of Bride-Cake to put under my pillow; and I had the sweetest
dream—I thought we were going to be married together. I have, many is the
time, taken great pains to pare an Apple Whole, and afterwards flung the Peel
over my head; and it always falls in the shape of the first letter of his
Sirname or Christian name. I am sure Mr. <HI>Blossom</HI> loves me,
because I stuck two of the Kernels upon my forehead, while I thought upon
him and the lubberly squire my pappa wants me to have: Mr.
<HI>Blossom</HI>'s Kernel stuck on, but the other dropt off directly.</P>
<P>LAST Friday, Mr. TOWN, was <HI>Valentine</HI>'s Day; and I'll
tell you what I did the night before. I got five bay-leaves, and pinned four of
them to the four corners of my pillow, and the fifth to the middle; and then if
I dreamt of my sweet∣heart, <HI>Betty</HI> said we should be married
before the year was out. But to make it more sure, I boiled an egg hard, and
took out the yolk, and filled it up with salt; and when I went to bed, eat it
shell and all, without speaking or drink∣ing after it: and this was to have
the same effect with the bay-leaves. We also wrote our lovers names upon
bits of paper, and rolled them up in clay, and put them into wa∣ter; and the
first that rose up, was to be our Valentine. Would you think it? Mr.
<HI>Blossom</HI> was my man: and I lay a-bed and shut my eyes all the
morning, till he came to our house; for I would not have seen another man
before him for all the world.</P>
<P><PB N="336" REF="343"/>DEAR Mr. TOWN, if you know any other
ways to try our fortune by, do put them in your paper. My Mamma laughs at us,
and says there is nothing in them; but I am sure there is, for several
Misses at our boarding school have tried them, and they have all happened
true: and I am sure my own sister <HI>Hetty,</HI> who died just before
<HI>Christmas,</HI> stood in the Church Porch last Midsummer Eve to
see all that were to die that year in our parish; and she saw her
<HI>own</HI> apparition.</P>

WHIMSEY.</SIGNED></CLOSER>

<DIV2 TYPE="body of issue">
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HERE is no phrase in the whole voca∣bulary of modern
conversation, which has a more vague signification than the words 
<Q REND="inline">"Good Company."</Q> People of fashion
modestly explain it to mean only them∣selves; and, like the old
<HI>Romans,</HI> look on all others as Barbarians. Thus a star or a ribband,
a title or a place denotes Good Company; and a man rises in the esteem of
the polite circle according to his rank or his rent-roll. This way of
reasoning is so well known and so generally adopt∣ed, that we are not
surprized to hear polite persons com∣plain at their return from the play,
that the house was very much crouded, but that there was no Company: though
indeed I could not help smiling at a lady's saying she preferred St.
<HI>James</HI>'s church to St. <HI>George</HI>'s, because the pews were
commonly filled with better Company.</P>
<P><PB N="338" REF="345"/>I PROPOSE at present to consider this
comprehensive term only as it respects a society of friends, who meet in
order to pass their time in an agreeable manner. To do this the more
effectually I shall take a cursory view of the several methods now in
vogue, by which a set of acquaintance endeavour to amuse each other. The
reader will here meet with some very extraordinary inventions for this
purpose; and when he has fixed his choice, may try to introduce himself
into that company he likes best.</P>
<P>THERE is a great demand for wit and humour in some parts of
this metropolis. Among many he is reckoned the Best Company who can enliven
his conversation with strokes of facetiousness, and in
<HI>Shakespear</HI>'s words 
<Q REND="inline">"set the table on a roar."</Q> But as wit and
humour do not always fall to the share of those who aim at shining in
conversation, our jokers and witlings have wisely devised several
mecha∣nical ways of gaining that end. I know one who is thought a very
facetious fellow by the club, of which he is a mem∣ber, because every night,
as soon as the clock strikes twelve, he begins to crow like a cock. Another
is accounted a man of <HI>immense humour</HI> for entertaining his friends
with a bur∣lesque hornpipe: and a third has the reputation of being excellent
Company by singing a song, and at the same time playing the tune upon the
table with his knuckles and elbows. Mimickry is in these societies an
indispensible re∣quisite in a good companion. Imitations of the actors
and other well-known characters are very much admired. But the mimic is by no
means limited to an imitation of the human species; for an exact
representation of the brute creation will procure him infinite applause.
Very many of these wits may be met with in different quarters of the town;
and it is but a week ago since I was invited to pass the evening with a
society, which, after a display of their <PB N="339" REF="346"/> several
talents, I found to consist of a Dog, a Cat, a Mon∣key, an Ass, and a
couple of Dancing Bears.</P>
<P>I CANNOT help looking with some veneration on the wit exerted
in societies of this sort, since it has the extra∣ordinary quality of
never creating either disgust or satiety. They assemble every night,
tell the same stories, repeat the same jokes, sing the same songs;
and they are every night attended with the same applause and merriment.
Considering how much their wit is used, it is surprising that it
should not be worn out. Sometimes however one of the society makes a new
acquisition, which is immedi∣ately thrown into the common stock of humour,
and con∣stantly displayed as part of the entertainment of the even∣ing. A
gentleman of this cast lately shewed me with great joy the postscript
of a letter, in which his correspondent promised him <HI>huge fun</HI> the
next time he should see him, for he had got two new stories and three or
four excellent songs from one of the actors.</P>
<P>THESE are certainly very agreeable methods of passing the
evening, and must please all persons who have any relish for wit and
humour. But these powers of entertaining are not every where the standard
of Good Company. There are places in which he is the Best Company who drinks
most. A Boon Companion lays it down as a rule that 
<Q REND="inline">"talking spoils conversation."</Q> A bumper
is his argument, and his first care is to promote a brisk circulation of
the bottle. He shews his esteem for an absent friend by toasting him in
a bumper extraordinary, and is frequently so good and loyal a subject as to
drink His Majesty's health in half-pints. If he is desired to sing a
catch, he still keeps the main point in view, and gives a song wrote in
so ingenious a stile, that it obliges the company to toss off a glass
at the <PB N="340" REF="347"/> end of every stanza. If he talks, it is of 
<Q REND="inline">"healths five fathom deep,"</Q> or a late
<HI>hard bout</HI> with another set of jolly fellows; and he takes care by a
quick round of Toasts to supply the want of other conversation.</P>
<P>I HAVE ever thought the invention of Toasts very useful and
ingenious. They at once promote hard drinking, and serve as a kind of
memorials of every glass that has been drank: They also furnish those
with conversation who have nothing to say, or at least, by banishing
all other topics, put the whole company on a level. Besides all this three or
four rounds of Toasts, where a good many are met toge∣ther, must
unavoidably lift them all into Good Company. These are no small advantages
to society; not to mention the wit and morality contained in many
Toasts.</P>
<P>TOASTS are doubtless very useful and entertaining; but the
wisest institution ever made in drinking societies is the custom of
appointing what is called an Absolute Toast∣master. The gentleman
invested with this dignity is created king of the company, and, like other
absolute monarchs, he commonly makes great use of his power. It is
particularly his office to name the Toast, to observe that every man duly
tosses off his bumper, and is in every respect Good Company. He is also
to correct all misdemeanors, and com∣monly punishes an offender by
sconcing him a bumper: that is, in the language of hard drinkers, not
unmercifully denying him his due glass, but obliging him to add another to it
of perhaps double the quantity. For offences of a very heinous nature, the
transgressor is ordered a decanter of water, or a tankard of small
beer. The privilege of in∣flicting a bumper is exerted almost every moment,
for there is hardly any sort of behaviour which does not produce this
punishment. I have known a man sconced for drinking, <PB N="341" REF="348"/>
for not drinking, for singing, for talking, for being silent, and at length
sconced dead drunk, and made very Good Company.</P>
<P>BUT none of these qualifications abovementioned consti∣tute
Good Company in the genteel part of the world. Polite assemblies neither
aim at wit and humour, nor make the least pretence to cultivate society.
Their whole evenings are consumed at the card-table, without the least
attempt at any other conversation, but the usual altercations of part∣ners
between the deals. Whist has destroyed conversation, spoilt society,
and murdered sleep. This kind of Good Company is as ridiculous, and more
insipid than either the society of witlings or hard drinkers. Tossing
off bumpers is as rational, and an employment infinitely more joyous than
shuffling a pack of cards a whole night: and puns, jokes, and mimickry
however stale and repeated, furnish the company with conversation of as
much use and variety as the odd trick, and four by Honours.</P>
<P>SUCH are the agreeable evenings passed at <HI>White</HI>'s
and the other coffee-houses about St. <HI>James</HI>'s. Such is the
happiness of Routes, Drums, and Hurricanes; and without Gaming and intrigues
what insipid things are even Masquerades and Ridottos! At such meetings,
the man who is Good Com∣pany plays the game very well, knows more cases than
are in <HI>Hoyle,</HI> and often possesses some particular
qualifications, which would be no great recommendation to him any where else.
Instead of meeting together, like other companies, with a desire of mutual
delight, they sit down with a de∣sign upon the pockets of each other:
though indeed it is no wonder, when one has stripped another of two or three
thousand pounds, if the succesful gamester thinks the person he has
fleeced very Good Company.</P>
<P><PB N="342" REF="349"/>BY what has been said it appears that
the notion of Good Company excludes all useful conversation: which in
either of the above-mentioned societies would undoubtedly be despi∣sed as
stupid and pedantic. The witlings have too lively a genius, and too warm an
imagination to admit it. The Boon Companions can join nothing but love to a
bottle: and among Gamesters it would, like sleep, be mere loss of time,
and hinderance of business. Yet an accomplished member of either of
these societies is called Good Company; which is just as proper an
expression, as, according to Serjeant <HI>Kite, Carolus</HI> is good
<HI>Latin</HI> for Queen <HI>Ann,</HI> or a stout beating. But a set of
people who assemble for no other purpose than to game, have, in
particular, so very bad a title to the denomination of Good Company, that
they ap∣pear to me to be the very worst.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="body of issue">
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG> MISFORTUNE, which happened to me the other day,
sufficiently convinced me of the inconveniences arising from the
indiscrimi∣nate power lodged in our Press Gangs. I would not have the
reader think, that I was pressed myself:—but my Devil (that is, the
messenger of the printing-house) was carried off, as he was going with
the copy of a Connoisseur to press. Learning appears to me of so much
importance, that (in my opinion) the per∣sons of the lowest retainers to it
should be sacred from <PB N="344" REF="351"/> molestation; and it gives me
concern, (though a very loyal subject), that even a ballad-singer, or the
hawker of Bloody News should be interupted in their literary vocations. I
have in vain endeavoured to recover my M.S. again: for, though I cannot but
think any one of my papers of almost as much consequence to the nation as
the fitting out a fleet, the ignorant sailors were so regardless of its
inestimable contents, that after much enquiry I detected them (with my Devil
in conjunction) lighting their pipes with it, at a low alehouse by <HI>Puddle
Dock.</HI></P>
<P>THIS irretrievable loss to the public, as well as myself,
led me to consider, whether some other method might not be thought of, to
raise sufficient forces for the fleet and army, without disturbing poor
labourers and honest mecha∣nics in their peaceful occupations. I have at
length, with great pains and expence of thought, hit upon a Scheme which will
effectually answer that end; and without further preface shall lay it
before the world.</P>
<P>I WOULD propose, that every useless member of the
com∣munity should be made of service to his country, by being obliged to
climb the ropes, or carry a musquet; and every detrimental one should be
prevented from injuring his coun∣trymen, and sent to annoy the common enemy.
To begin with the country. There is no occasion to rob the fields of their
husbandmen, or to fetch our soldiers, as the <HI>Romans</HI> took their
Dictator, from the plough. It is well known, that every county can supply us
with numerous recruits, if we were to raise them out of that idle body called
Country Squires; many of whom are born only for the destruction of game, and
disturbance of their neighbours, They are mere vegetables, which grow up and
rot on the same spot of ground; except a few which are transplanted 
<PB N="345" REF="352"/> into the Parliament House. Their whole life is hurried
away in scampering after foxes, leaping five-bar gates, trampling upon the
farmers corn, and swilling October. As they are by their profession
excellent marksmen, and have been used to carry a gun, they might employ
their powder to more purpose in fetching down a Frenchman than a pheasant:
and most of them might be incorporated among Cavalry, or formed into
light-bodied troops, and mounted on their own Hunters. They might also be of
great use in maroding or getting in forage; and if they would follow an enemy
with the same alacrity and defiance of danger, as a fox, they might do great
execution in a pursuit. The greatest danger would be, that if a fox
should perchance cross them in their march, they would be tempted to run
from their colours for the sake of a chace; and we should have them all
desert, or (in the language of fox-hunters) <HI>gone away.</HI></P>
<P>IF the country is infested with these useless and
obnoxious animals, called Squires, this metropolis is no less over-run with a
set of idle and mischievous creatures, which we may call Town Squires. We
might soon levy a very numerous army, were we to enlist into it every
vagrant about town, who, not having any lawful calling, from thence takes upon
himself the title of gentleman, and adds an <HI>Esquire</HI> to his name. A
very large <HI>corps</HI> too might be formed from the Students at the Inns of
Court, who under the pretence of following the law, receive, as it were, a
sanction for doing nothing at all. With these the several tribes of
play-house and coffee-house Critics, and that collective body of them,
called the TOWN, may be allowed to rank: And though no great exploits can be
expected from these <HI>Invalids,</HI> yet (as they are of no other use
whatever) they may at least serve in the army, like <HI>Falstaff</HI>'s
men, as 
<Q REND="inline">"food for powder."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="346" REF="353"/>BUT a very formidable troop might be
composed of that part of them, distinguished by the name of Bloods. The
fury of their assaults on drawers and watchmen, and the spirit
displayed in storming a bagnio, would be of infinite service in the field
of battle. But I would recommend it to the General, to have them strictly
disciplined; lest they should shoot some of their own comrades, or
perhaps run away, merely for the sake of the joke. Under proper regu∣lations
such valiant gentlemen would certainly be of use. I had lately some
thoughts of recommending to the Justices, to list the Bloods among those
brave, resolute fellows em∣ployed as Thief-takers. But they may now serve
nobler purposes in the army: And what may we not expect from such intrepid
heroes, who for want of opportunity to exert their prowess in warlike
skirmishes abroad, have been obli∣ged to vent their courage by breaking the
peace at home?</P>
<P>EVERY one will agree with me, that those Men of Ho∣nour, who
make fighting their business, and cannot let their swords rest quietly
in their scabbards, should be obli∣ged to draw them in the service of His
Majesty. What might we not expect from these furious
<HI>Drawcansirs,</HI> if, instead of cutting one another's throats, their
skill in arms was properly turned against the enemy. A very little
disci∣pline would make them admirable soldiers: for (as <HI>Mercutio</HI>
says) they are already 
<Q REND="inline">"the very butchers of a silk button."</Q> I
have known one of these Duellists, to keep his hand in, employ himself
every morning in thrusting at a bit of pa∣per stuck against the
wainscoat; and I have heard another boast, that he could snuff a candle
with his pistol. These gentlemen are, therefore, very fit to be employed in
close engagements: But it will be necessary to keep them in continual
action; for otherwise they would breed a kind of <PB N="347" REF="354"/> civil
war amongst themselves, and, rather than not fight at all, turn their
weapons upon one another.</P>
<P>SEVERAL <HI>Irish</HI> Brigades, not inferior to those of
the same country in the Service of the <HI>French</HI> King, may be formed
out of those able bodied men, which are called Fortune-Hunters. The attacks
of these dauntless heroes have, in∣deed, been chiefly levelled at the other
sex: but employ∣ment may be found for these amourous knight-errants,
suit∣able to their known firmness and intrepidity; particularly in taking
places by storm, where there is a necessity for ravish∣ing virgins, and
committing outrages upon the women.</P>
<P>But among the many useless members of society, there are
none so unprofitable as the fraternity of Gamesters. I therefore, think
that their time would be much better em∣ployed in handling a musquet, than in
shuffling a pack of cards or shaking the dice-box. As to the Sharpers, it
is a pity that the same dexterity, which enables them to palm an ace or cog a
die, is not used by them in going through the manual exercise in the
military way. These latter might, indeed, be employed as marines, and
stationed in the <HI>West Indies</HI>; as many of them have already crost
the seas, and are perfectly well acquainted with the Plantations.</P>
<P>THE last proposal which I have to make on this subject, is
to take the whole body of Feeethinkers into the service. For this purpose I
would impress all the members of the <HI>Robin-Hood</HI> Society; and in
consideration of his great merit, I would advise, that the
<HI>Clare-Market</HI> Orator should be made chaplain to the regiment. One of
the favourite tenets of a Freethinker is, that all men are in a natural state
of warfare with each other: nothing therefore is so proper 
<PB N="348" REF="355"/> for him, as to be actually engaged in war. As he has no
squeamish notions about what will become of him hereafter, he can have no
fears about death: I would, therefore, always have the Freethinkers put upon
the most dangerous exploits, exposed to the greatest heat of battle, and
sent upon the Forlorn Hope. For, since they confess that they are born
into the world for no end whatever, and that they will be nothing after death,
it is but justice that they should be <HI>annihilated</HI> for the good of
their country.</P>

<SALUTE>DEAR COUSIN!</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> WAS greatly entertained with your late reflec∣tions on the
several branches of magic made use of in the affairs of love. I have
my∣self been very lately among the Seeers of Visions and Dreamers of
Dreams: and hope you will not be displeased at an account of portents and
prognostics full as extravagant, though they are not all owing to the same
cause, as those of your correspondent Miss <HI>Arabella Whimsey.</HI>
You must know, Cousin, that I am just returned from a visit of a
fortnight to an old aunt <PB N="350" REF="357"/> in the North; where I was
mightily diverted with the tra∣ditional superstitions, which are most
religiously preserved in the family, as they have been delivered down, time
out of mind, from their sagacious grandmothers.</P>
<P>WHEN I arrived, I found the mistress of the house very
busily employed with her two daughters in nailing an horse∣shoe to the
threshold of the door. This they told me, was to guard against the
spiteful designs of an old woman, who was a witch, and had threatened to do
the family a mis∣chief, because one of my young cousins laid two straws
across, to see if the old hag could walk over them. The young lady
herself assured me, that she had several times heard Goody
<HI>Cripple</HI> muttering to herself; and to be sure she was saying
the Lord's Prayer backwards. Besides, the old woman had very often asked
them for a pin: but they took care never to give her any thing that was
sharp, because she should not bewitch them. They afterwards told me
many other particulars of this kind, the same as are men∣tioned, with
infinite humour by the SPECTATOR: and to confirm them, they assured me,
that the eldest Miss, when she was little, used to have fits, till the
mother flung a knife at another old witch, (whom the devil had carried off in a
high wind) and fetched blood from her.</P>
<P>WHEN I was to go to bed, my aunt made a thousand apologies
for not putting me in the best room in the house, which she said had
never been lain in, since the death of an old washer-woman, who walked
every night, and haunted that room in particular. They fancied that the old
woman had hid money somewhere, and could not rest till she had told
somebody; and my cousin assured me, that she might have had it all to
herself, for the spirit came one night to her bed-side, and wanted to
tell her, but she had not cou∣rage <PB N="351" REF="358"/> to speak to it. I
learned also that they had a footman once, who hanged himself for love; and
he walked for a great while, till they got the parson to lay him in the Red
Sea.</P>
<P>I HAD not been here long, when an accident happened, which
very much alarmed the whole family. <HI>Towzer</HI> one night howled most
terribly; which was a sure sign, that somebody belonging to them would
die. The youngest Miss declared that she had heard the hen crow that
morn∣ing; which was another fatal prognostic. They told me, that just
before uncle died, <HI>Towzer</HI> howled so for several nights together,
that they could not quiet him; and my aunt heard the death-watch tick as
plainly as if there had been a clock in the room: the maid too, who sat up
with him, heard a bell toll at the top of the stairs, the very moment the
breath went out of his body. During this discourse, I overheard one of my
cousins whisper the other, that she was afraid their mamma would not live
long; for she smelt an ugly smell, like a dead body. They had a
dairy-maid, who died the very week after an hearse had stopt at their door
in its way to church; and the eldest miss, when she was but thirteen,
saw her own brother's ghost, (who was gone the <HI>West-Indies)</HI>
walking in the garden; and to be sure nine months after, they had an account,
that he died on board the ship, the very same day, and hour of the day,
that Miss saw his apparition.</P>
<P>I NEED not mention to you the common incidents, which were
accounted by them no less prophetic. If a cinder popped from the fire, they
were in haste to examine whether it was a purse or a coffin. They were
aware of my arrival long before I came, because they had seen a stranger
on the grate. The youngest Miss will let nobody <PB N="352" REF="359"/>
use the poker but herself; because, when she stirs it, it always
burns bright, which is a sign she will have a bright husband: and she
is no less sure of a good one, because she generally has ill luck at
cards. Nor is the candle less ora∣cular than the fire: for the squire of
the parish came one night to pay them a visit, when the tallow
winding-sheet pointed towards him, and he broke his neck soon after in a
fox-chase. My aunt one night observed with great pleasure a letter in the
candle; and she hoped it would be from her son in <HI>London.</HI> We knew,
when a spirit was in the room, by the candle burning blue: but poor cousin
<HI>Nancy</HI> was ready to cry one time, when she snuffed it out and could
not blow it in again, though her sister did it at a whiff.</P>
<P>WE had no occasion for an almanack or the weather∣glass,
to let us know whether it would rain or shine. One evening I proposed to
ride out with my cousins the next day to see a gentleman's house in the
neigbourhood; but my aunt assured us it would be wet, she knew very well
from the shooting of her corn. Besides, there was a great spider crawling
up the chimney, and the blackbird in the kitchen began to sing: which were
both of them as certain forerunners of rain. But the most to be depended on
in these cases is a tabby cat, which is usually basking on the parlour
hearth. If the cat turned her tail to the fire, we were to have a hard frost:
if she licked her tail, rain would certainly ensue. They wondered what
stranger they should see; because Puss washed her foot over her
left ear. The old lady complained of a cold, and her daughter remarked, it
would go through the family; for she observed that poor <HI>Tab</HI> had
sneezed several times. Poor <HI>Tab</HI> however once flew at one of my
cousins; for which she had like to have been destroyed, as the whole
family began to think she was no other than a witch.</P>
<P><PB N="353" REF="360"/>IT is impossible to tell you the
several tokens, by which they know whether good or ill luck will happen to
them. Spilling of salt, or laying knives across, are every where ac∣counted
ill omens; but a pin with the head turned towards you, or to be followed by a
strange dog, I found were very lucky. I heard one of my cousins tell the
cookmaid, that she boiled away all her sweethearts, because she had let
her dishwater boil over. The same young lady one morn∣ing came down to
breakfast with her cap the wrong side out; which the mother observing,
charged her not to alter it all the day, for fear she should turn luck.</P>
<P>BUT, above all, I could not help remarking the various
prognostics, which the old lady and her daughters used to collect from
almost every part of the body. A white speck upon the nails made them as
sure of a gift, as if they had it already in their pockets. The eldest
sister is to have one husband more than the youngest, because she
has one wrin∣kle more in her forehead; but the other will have the ad∣vantage
of her in the number of children, as was plainly proved by snapping their
finger-joints. It would take up too much room, to set down every
circumstance which I obser∣ved of this sort during my stay with them: I
shall therefore conclude my letter with the several remarks on the rest
of the body, as far as I could learn them from this prophetic family: for as I
was a relation, you know, they had less reserve.</P>
<P>IF the head itches, it is a sign of rain. If the head aches,
it is a profitable pain. If you have the tooth-ach, you don't love true. If
your eye-brow itches, you will see a stranger. If your right eye itches,
you will cry; if your left you will laugh. If your nose itches, you will
shake hands, kiss a fool, drink a glass of wine, run against a 
<PB N="354" REF="361"/> cuckold's door, or miss them all four. If your right
ear or cheek burns, your left friends are talking of you; if your left, your
right friends are talking of you. If your elbow itches, you will change your
bedfellow. If your right hand itches, you will pay away money; if your left,
you will receive. If your stomach itches, you will eat pudding. If your
gar∣tering-place itches, you will go to a strange place. If your back itches,
butter will be cheap when grass grows there. If your side itches,
somebody is wishing for you. If your knee itches, you will kneel in a
strange church: If your foot, you will tread upon strange ground. Lastly,
if you shiver, some body is walking over your grave.</P>

<HEAD>A DIALOGUE BETWEEN A TEA-TABLE and a

<SP>
<SPEAKER>TEA-TABLE.</SPEAKER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">S</SEG>O, Madam—these are fine hours, I must
confess! It is now past four o'clock; and you and your companions have been
making such a racket here, all sober people must cry out shame upon
you. I wonder what pleasure it can be for fifty or an hundred persons to
meet together and employ the whole night at Cribbage, Brag, and Whist. For my
part, I am sure I had rather live in an <PB N="356" REF="363"/> herb-cellar,
and entertain washerwomen over their half-quarterns of bohea with a glass
of gin between every cup, than lead such an irregular life as you do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CARD-TABLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>And I, Madam, had rather live in a filthy ale-house,
and be poisoned with the greasy cards of porters and car∣men, than lead
such an insipid life as you do. You are, indeed, the delight of city-wives
and maid servants: but I bless my stars, I am caressed by persons
of the first rank and fashion, and am known to keep the best company.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TEA-TABLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Madam, if the truth was known, you have no reason to
boast much of your company. Is it not notorious that you entertain the very
worst of people? People that want common honesty, cheats of Quality, and
Right Honour∣able sharpers. Who had you this night with you?—There was
my Lord —, and Lady —, and Sir <HI>John —.</HI> These,
Indeed, are your persons of the first rank and fashion: but, to speak
the truth, they are no better than pick-pockets.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CARD-TABLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't wonder you should grow so abusive, as
your ta∣lent for scandal has always been remarkable. But pray, Madam, since
you talk of company, what sort of people are your particular cronies? You are
pleased to upbraid me with conniving at sharpers: and I am sure you
associate with vile pimps and go-betweens. Who are they that usually
compose your morning-levee? A milliner perhaps, or a mantua-maker, or a
<HI>French</HI> hair-cutter: and these sort of gentry, you must own, are
very commode in carrying on other business besides what they profess.
Nay did not <PB N="357" REF="364"/> you admit Captain — the other morning
to a private <HI>tête à téte</HI> conversation with the
lady of this house, and in her very bed-chamber?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TEA-TABLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>For that last visiter I must own myself
obliged to you, Madam. The <HI>Debt of Honour,</HI> as you call it, in which
you had involved her ladyship over night, they thought fit to cancel the next
morning. And give me leave to tell you, Madam, that since the ladies have
so much frequented your company, many of them have been first cheated of
their money, and afterwards cajoled out of their virtue.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CARD-TABLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is always your way—your whole delight is in
abusing other people, propagating malicious tales, and slan∣dering
reputations. But remember what the Poet says, 
<Q> 
<L>Who steals my <HI>purse</HI> steals
trash—</L> 
<L>But he who filches from me my <HI>good name,</HI>
&amp;c.</L></Q> The lines are very common, I need not repeat them to you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TEA-TABLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>If they had not been very common, and taken out of a
play besides, I should have wondered to hear you quote them. For who can be
more illiterate than your friends and acquaintance? <HI>Hoyle</HI>'s Treatise
on Whist is almost the only book they have ever read: and as the mind of
man, before it has received any ideas, has been compared to a white sheet of
paper, we may say that a gamester's mind is. a mere pack of cards, and has
no impressions beyond the pips and the Four Honours.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="358" REF="365"/>
<SPEAKER>CARD-TABLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>To be sure, Madam, I must acknowledge your
superior understanding; you have such prodigious opportunities of
improving yourself! Can any thing, for instance, be so plea∣sant and
instructive as your chit-chats and gossipings with the good city-wives
over their <HI>disturbed</HI> tea and a huge plate of bread and butter!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TEA-TABLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>But can any thing be so insipid (to say no
worse of it) as the polite jargon, which makes up the whole of your
conversation over a pack of cards! In this, indeed, you put those of the
highest rank and sense upon a level with the lowest and most ignorant
of the vulgar; for gamesters have the same language whether in an
alehouse or a draw∣ing-room: and I would as soon listen to a set of
draymen squabbling about their half-pence at All-Fours and One-and-Thirty, as
to the club at <HI>White</HI>'s wrangling for thou∣sands. The talk of either
party is altogether confined to their different games; and if the genteel
gamester, upon every turn of the cards against him, damns himself with a
good grace, the drayman bluntly pours out a volley of the same oaths. But I
should not so much quarrel with you for having seduced the men, if you
had not so strangely in∣fatuated the ladies, who seem more particularly
designed for my company. I am now looked upon as a mere in∣cumbrance; and
they think every moment that is lost upon me, very tedious, while it detains
them from your refined pleasures. The women of this country used to be
admired for their virtues as well as their beauty: but since you have
engrossed so much of their time and thoughts, at the same time that you
have spoiled their faces, you have corrupted their morals.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="359" REF="366"/>
<SPEAKER>CARD-TABLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Their morals, Madam!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TEA-TABLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know you make a jest of morality; and every other
consideration gives way, when once the love of play is predominant. For
example;—What an alteration have you made in the lady of this house? I
used to see her every morning as blooming as a rose; nor had she any
need of paint to repair the damages you have since done her, by keeping her
up all night. At present I am seldom admit∣ted to her before the afternoon;
and till she has new dressed her face, she appears as hagged and as
frightful as your <HI>Queen of Clubs.</HI> Before she fell into your company
she had proper notions of virtue; but you soon reduced her to the
necessity of parting with both her honour and honesty. In short, she
now is—what I don't chuse to call her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CARD-TABLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Honour and honesty! ha, ha.—Upon my word, you
are a strange old fashioned creature. I suppose, we shall have you
talk of religion too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TEA-TABLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why really, Madam, I must own that your
acquain∣tance plainly enough manifest by their constant practice a thorough
disregard to every thing sacred. They particu∣larly take a pride in
violating the Sabbath; and your com∣pany is the more acceptable among people of
fashion upon that day, because you dare not then shew your face in any
sober family.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="360" REF="367"/>
<SPEAKER>CARD-TABLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, now I have done with you, since you are such
a low creature as to look upon Sunday as more holy than any other day. You are
fit, indeed, to live in a fine lady's house, and to have any scruples of
religion about you! But harkye,—We are to have a grand route here upon
<HI>Good-Friday</HI>; and I would advise you to get down into the kitchen
among the maids, where you may shew your re∣gard to the day, by feasting
them with Bohea of six shil∣lings a pound, and hot cross buns. And pray,
Madam, let me hear no more of your religion.</P>

<HEAD>NUMBER LXI.

<EPIGRAPH>
<Q> 
<L>Coelum ipsum petimus stultitiâ.—</L> 
<BIBL>HOR.</BIBL></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<DIV2 TYPE="body of issue">
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>T is observed by the <HI>French</HI> that a Cat, a Priest,
and an Old Woman are sufficient to constitute a religious Sect in
<HI>England.</HI> So universally it seems, are learning and genius
diffused through this island, that the lowest plebeians are deep
casuists in matters of faith as well as po∣litics: and so many and
wonderful are the new lights con∣tinually breaking in upon us, that we daily
make fresh discoveries, and strike out unbeaten paths to future
hap∣piness. The above observation of our neighbours is in truth rather too
full: for a priest is so far from necessary, that a new species of
doctrine would be better received by our old women, and other well disposed
good people, from a layman. The most extraordinary tenets of religion are
very succesfully propagated under the sanction of the lea∣thern apron
instead of the cassock: Every corner of the town has a barber, mason,
bricklayer, or some other handi∣craft <PB N="362" REF="369"/> teacher: and
there are almost as many sects in this metropolis as there are parish
churches.</P>
<P>AS to the Old Women, since the passions of females are
stronger in youth, and their minds weaker in age, than those of the other
sex, their readiness in embracing any principles of religion pressed on
them with particular earnest∣ness and vehemence, is not very wonderful.
They hope, by the most rigid demeanor in the decline of life, to make amends
for that unbounded loose given to their passions in their younger years.
The same violence however, com∣monly accompanies them in religion, as
formerly actuated them in their pleasures; and their zeal entirely eats up
their charity. They look with a malevolent kind of pity on all who are still
employed in <HI>worldly</HI> undertakings, 
<Q REND="inline">"carry prayer books in their pockets,"</Q> and
piously damn all their relations and acquaintance with texts of scripture.
I know an old gentlewoman of this cast who has formed herself as a pattern
of staid behaviour, and values herself for having given up at threescore
the vanities of sixteen. She denounces heavy judgments on all frequenters of
public diversions, and forebodes the worst consequences from every party
of pleasure. I have known her foretell the ruin of her niece from a country
dance: nay, she can perceive irregular desires flaming from a gay coloured
topknot, and has even descried adultery itself lurking beneath the thin
veil of a worked apron, or beaming from a diamond girdle-buckle.</P>
<P>BUT we might perhaps suffer a few good Old Ladies to go to
heaven their own way, if these Sects were not per∣nicious on many other
accounts. Such strange doctrines are wonderfully apt to unsettle the minds
of the common people, who often make an odd transition from infidelity to
enthusiasm, and become bigots from arrant freethinkers: Their faith
however, it may be well imagined, is not a saving faith; as they are worked
up to an adoration of the CREATOR, from the same slavish principle that
induces <PB N="363" REF="370"/> the <HI>Indians</HI> to worship the Devil. It
is amazing how strongly fear operates on these weak creatures, and how
easily a canting, whining rascal can mould them to his purpose. I have
known many a rich tradesman wheedled and threatned out of his
subsistence, and himself and unhappy family at last lectured into the
work-house. Thus do these vile hypocrites turn a poor convert's head to
save his soul; and deprive him of all happiness in this world, under
pre∣tence of securing it to him eternally in the next.</P>
<P>NOTHING can do religion more injury than these solemn
mockeries of it. Many of these Sects consist almost entirely of
battered prostitutes, and persons of the most infamous character.
Reformation is their chief pretence; wherefore the more abandoned those are
of whom they make proselytes, the more they pride themselves on their
conversion. I remember a debauched young fellow, who pretended a sudden
amendment of his principles, in order to repair his shattered fortune. He
turned Methodist, and soon began to manifest a kind of spiritual
fondness for a pious sister. He wooed her according to the directions of
the rubric, sent her sermons instead of billet-doux, 
<Q REND="inline">"greeted her with a holy kiss,"</Q> and
obtained his mistress by appearing in every respect a thorough devotee.
But alas! the good gen∣tleman could never be prevailed on to comply with
religious ordinances, or appear any more at church or meeting, after the
performance of the marriage-ceremony. The lowest of the vulgar also, for
their peculiar ends, frequently be∣come sectaries. They avail themselves of
a mock conver∣sion to redeem their lost characters, and, like criminals at
<HI>Rome,</HI> make the church a sanctuary for villainy. By this artifice
they recommend themselves to the charity of weak but well-meaning
Christians, and often insinuate themselves as servants into Methodist
families.</P>
<P>LE SAGE, with his usual humour, represents <HI>Gil Blas</HI>
as wonderfully charmed with the seeming sanctity of <HI>Am∣brose de
Lamela,</HI> when he took him into his service: and <PB N="364" REF="371"/>
<HI>Gil Blas</HI> is even not offended at his remissness the very first
night, when his new servant tells him that it was owing to his attending his
devotions. But it soon appears that this sly valet had been employed in
concerting the robbery of his master. A due attention to religion is so
rare a quality in all ranks of people, that I am far from blaming it in
servants; but when I see their religion shewing itself in laziness,
and observe them neglecting their common bu∣siness under the pretext of
performing acts of supererogation, I am apt to question their sincerity,
and to take every ser∣vant of that kind for a mere Saint <HI>Ambrose.</HI>
An old <HI>Mora∣vian</HI> aunt of mine, of whom I have formerly made worthy
mention, would never have any servants, who did not be∣long to the society
of the United Brethren. But so little did the good lady's endeavours to
preserve good order and a spirit of devotion in her house succeed; that
the generality of the men fell into evil courses, and most of the pious
sisterhood left the family with big bellies.</P>
<P>I WOULD not be thought to deny my fellow-subjects full liberty
of conscience, and all the benefits of the Toleration-Act; yet I cannot help
regarding these weak, if not ill-meant divisions from the established
church as a dangerous kind of Freethinking: not so shocking indeed as the
impious avowal of atheism and infidelity, but often attended with the same
bad consequences. A religion founded on mad∣ness and enthusiasm, is
almost as bad as no religion at all; and what is worst, the unhappy errors
of particular sects expose the purest religion in the world to the
scoffs of un∣believers. Shallow witlings exercise their little talents for
ridicule on matters of religion, and fall into atheism and blasphemy in
order to avoid bigotry and enthusiasm. The weakness of the sectaries
strengthen them in their ridiculous notions, and produce many other evils, as
will appear from the following short history.</P>
<P><PB N="365" REF="372"/>IN the glorious reign of Queen
<HI>Elizabeth</HI> there resided in these kingdoms a worthy lady called
RELIGION. She was remarkable for the sweetness of her temper; which was
chearful without levity, and grave without moroseness. She was also
particularly decent in her dress as well as behaviour, and preserved with
uncommon mildness the strictest regularity in her family. Though she
had a noble genius, and led a very sober life, yet in those days she kept
the best company, was greatly admired by the Queen, and was even intimate
with most of the maids of honour. What became of her and her family is not
known, but it is very certain that they have at pre∣sent no connection with
the polite world. Some affirm that the line is extinct; though I have indeed
been told that the late Bishop <HI>Berkley</HI> and the present Bishops
of — and — de∣scended from principal branches of it, and that
some few of the same family are resident on small livings in the
country.</P>
<P>WE are told by a certain fashionable author, that there were
formerly two men in a madhouse at <HI>Paris,</HI> one of whom imagined
himself <HI>The</HI> FATHER, and the other <HI>The</HI> SON. In like manner,
no sooner did the good lady RELIGION disappear, but she was personated
by a crazy old beldam called SUPER∣STITION. But the cheat was instantly
discovered; for instead of the mild discipline with which her
predecessor ruled her family, she governed entirely by severity, racks,
wheels, gib∣bets, sword, fire and faggot. Instead of chearfulness she
introduced gloom, was perpetually crossing herself with holy water, and,
to avert the terrible judgments of which she was hourly in fear, she
compiled a new almanack, in which she wonderfully multiplied the number of
red letters. After a miserable life she died melancholy-mad, but left a
will be∣hind her, in which she left a very considerable sum to build an
hospital for religious lunatics; which I am informed, will speedily be
built on the same ground, where the Foundery, the celebrated Methodist
meeting-house, now stands.</P>
<P>SUPERSTITION left behind her a son called ATHEISM, begot on
her by a <HI>Moravian</HI> teacher at one of their Love-Feasts. ATHEISM
soon shewed himself to be a most profli∣gate <PB N="366" REF="373"/>
abandoned fellow. He came very early upon town, and was a remarkable Blood.
Among his other frolicks he turned author, and is said to have written in
concert with Lord <HI>Bolingbroke.</HI> After having squandered a large
fortune, he turned gamester, then pimp, and then highwayman; in which last
occupation he was soon detected, taken, and thrown into <HI>Newgate.</HI> He
behaved very impudently in the Condemned Hole, abused the Ordinary whenever
that gen∣tleman attended him, and encouraged all his fellow prisoners, in the
<HI>Newgate</HI> phrase, to die hard. When he came to the gallows, instead
of the psalm he sung a bawdy catch, threw away the book, and bid <HI>Jack
Ketch</HI> tuck him up like a gen∣tleman. Many of his relations were present
at the execution, and shook their heads repeating the words of <HI>Mat</HI>
in the <HI>Beggar's Opera,</HI>

is now sitting, I shall proceed to lay before them the sub∣stance of a
Debate, that happened in the <HI>Committee of Religion,</HI> and which was
unex∣pectedly occasioned by a Motion that was made by Miss
<HI>Graveairs.</HI> This Committee had long been looked upon as useless,
but for form sake continued to meet, though it was adjourned immediately: but
one day, there being more members present than usual, the Chair-woman was
no sooner in the Chair, than the lady above-mentioned addressed her in
the following speech.</P>
<Q><TEXT LANG="eng">
<BODY>
<DIV1 TYPE="speech">
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is with no less surprise than concern, that I reflect
on the danger to which the greater part of my sex, either through ignorance
or choice, are now exposed; and <PB N="368" REF="375"/> I have the
strongest reasons to believe, that nothing but the vigorous and timely
Resolutions of this wise Assembly can prevent them from changing their
religion, and becoming ROMAN CATHOLICS. What subject can be more
interest∣ing and important to Us, whether we consider ourselves as a
Committee of Religion, a Parliament of Women, or an Assembly of
Protestants? Was such a design to be carried into execution, the free
use of our tongues would be taken away; we should never be suffered
perhaps to speak to the other sex but through grates and bars, and this
place of our Assembly would be probably the abode of Nuns and Fryars. But
least you should think me thus alarmed without reason, I shall now lay
before you the grounds of my complaint; that, if it is not too late we may
correct the evil, or if it is we may guard against it.</P>
<P>MY fears are grounded on those remarks, that have long been
made on the Dress of the sex. Constant as the men have stiled us to the
love of change, little have they ima∣gined, that Popery was invariably the
object to which every innovation was designed to lead. So long ago as when,
to the honour of our sex, a Queen was upon the throne, it was the fashion,
as we may learn from <HI>Pope,</HI> for the ladies to wear upon their breasts
a flaming CROSS. The same fashion has been transmitted to the present
times. What, Madam, is this but downright Popery? In the Catholic countries
they are contented with erecting Crucifixes in their roads and churches; but
alas! in this Protestant kingdom Crosses are alike to be seen in places
sacred and profane, the court, the playhouse, and (pardon me ladies!) this
venera∣ble Assembly itself is not without them. I am apt to suspect,
that this heterodox introduction of the Cross into the female dress had an
higher original, than the days of Queen <HI>Ann,</HI> <PB N="369" REF="376"/>
whose affection for the Church, was very well known. It seems rather to
have been imported among us, together with the <HI>Jesuits,</HI> by the
Popish Consorts of the first or second <HI>Charles</HI>: or perhaps the
ladies first wore it in com∣plaisance to the <HI>English</HI> Pope
<HI>Joan,</HI> Queen <HI>Mary.</HI> This much is certain, that at the same
time our pious Reformer Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> expelled the Cross from our
altars, she effectually secured the necks of our ladies from this
super∣stition by the introduction of the Ruff.</P>
<P>THE next part of our dress that I shall mention, which
favours of Popery, is the CAPUCHIN. This garment in truth has a near
resemblance to that of the Fryar, whose name it bears. Our grandmothers had
already adopted the HOOD, their daughters by a gradual advance introduced the
rest, but far greater improvements were still in store for Us. We all of
us remember, for it is not above two years ago, how all colours were neglected
for that of PURPLE. In Purple we glowed from the hat to the shoe, and in
such request were the ribbons and silks of that favourite colour, that
neither the milliner, mercer, nor dyer himself could answer the demand. Who
but must think that this arose from Popish principles? and though it may
be urged that the admired <HI>Fanny,</HI> who first introduced it, is no Nun,
yet you may all remember that the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> herself has been
styled, The SCARLET, or as some render it, The PURPLE WHORE.</P>
<P>BUT to prove indisputably our manifest approaches to
Popery, let me now refer you to that fashionable cloak, which, sorry I am
to see it, is wore by the far greater part even of this Assembly, and
which indeed is with great pro∣priety styled, <HI>The</HI> CARDINAL. For were
his Holiness the Pope to be introduced among us, he would almost fancy 
<PB N="370" REF="377"/> himself in his own Conclave: and were I not too well
ac∣quainted with my sisters principles, I myself should be in∣duced to
think, that to those in such grave attire nothing but a cloyster and a
grate was wanting. As to those of gayer colours, you need not be told, that
there are White and Grey Fryars abroad as well as Black: and as the
<HI>English</HI> are so remarkable for improving on their originals, we
shall not be then surprized at the variety of colours that appears among
us.</P>
<P>IT has been whispered too, that some of my sisters
have been so fond of the Monkish austerities, as to have their heads
shaved. This I do not aver of my own knowledge; but, if it is so, they
still condescend to wear artificial locks, though it would not be at all
strange, if they also should soon be laid aside, as they are already
prepared for it by leaving off their caps. I shall only desire you still
farther to reflect, how fashionable it is for the ladies to shine with
borrowed faces; and then I believe you will readily allow, that their votaries,
the men, are in great danger also of being seduced to Popery; since do
they not already, by the compliments they pay to a painted face, address an
<HI>Image</HI> and adore a <HI>Picture?</HI></P>
<P>WHAT has now been said will induce you, I hope, to pay a
proper regard to the following Resolutions, which, I humbly move, may be
agreed to by this Committee, and re∣presented to the House.</P>
<Q> 
<LIST>
<LABEL>Resolved,</LABEL>
<ITEM>That it is the opinion of this Committee, that in
order to prevent the growth of Popery, no garments shall for the future be
imported, of Popish make or distinguished by Popish names.</ITEM>
<PB N="371" REF="378"/>
<LABEL>Resolved,</LABEL>
<ITEM>That in order to inforce a due obedience, every one
shall be obliged to practise the austerities of the sect they imitate;
so that for example the <HI>Cardinals</HI> shall be compelled to lead a
single life, and the <HI>Capuchins</HI> to go bare-foot.</ITEM>
<LABEL>Lastly,</LABEL>
<ITEM>It is recommended that, as a farther sanction to the
Bill proposed, every offender who shall be deemed incorrigible, shall be
banished from all routs, and transported to her country seat for seven
winters.</ITEM>
</LIST></Q>

</BODY>
</TEXT></Q>
<P>THIS Motion was strongly seconded by Lady <HI>Mend'em,</HI>
who urged in its support, that to her certain knowledge many of the sex
very frequently assembled at one anothers houses (and particularly on the
Sabbath) where Mass Books were actually laid before them, and the warmest
adoration paid to soome small Pictures or painted Images, which she was
told, resembled some Kings and Queens that had been long canonized. And the
Offerings that were constantly made at their Shrines would (she said) be
found on a moderate computation, to exceed those that were formerly made at
the tomb of <HI>Thomas à Becket.</HI> She added, that after the Catholic
custom they always fasted on those nights, or if they supt at all it
was only on FISH.</P>
<P>THE chief speaker on the other side of the question was
Lady <HI>Smart,</HI> one of the representatives for
<HI>Grosvenor-Square,</HI> who by the way was strongly suspected of
being a preju∣diced person, her enemies not denying that she had charms,
which could almost sanctify error itself. Nobody, she said, could
suspect the sex of inclining to Popery, who observed the aversion
they all discovered to a single life. The <PB N="372" REF="379"/> uses of
the obnoxious garments were allowed to be many; the names at least were
innocent; and the cry against them, she was sure, could only be raised
by the old and the ugly; since nothing could be so fantastic, as not to
become a pretty woman.</P>
<P>HER ladyship was joined by the Beauties present; but they
being few, their objections were over-ruled, and the Motion was carried. The
next day the House, on receiv∣ing the report, after some debate agreed to
the Resolu∣tions, and a Bill was ordered to be prepared and brought in
accordingly. Though at the same time they were of opinion, <HI>Nem. Con.</HI>
that if the FIG-LEAF BILL took place, these restrictions would be quite
needless.</P>

<HEAD>To Mr. TOWN.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Cambridge,</HI> 
<DATE><HI>April</HI> 4.</DATE></DATELINE> 
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>F you are a true sportsman, and have the honour of the
Turf at heart, you must have observed with the utmost concern a late
account in the news-papers, that WHITE-NOSE died at <HI>Doncaster</HI> of a
mortification in his foot. An article of this nature, and at such a time,
must strike a damp on all gentlemen breeders; and for my part I cannot help
looking on the present races at <HI>New-Market,</HI> as funeral games in
honour of the memory of WHITE-NOSE. The death of a stallion of such
conse∣quence is a public calamity to all knowing ones in the king∣dom: nor
does such an accident bring with it the least con∣solation; 
<PB N="374" REF="381"/> especially since it is not the fashion to
<HI>pit</HI> the lives of horses, as well as men, against each other.</P>
<P>ITALIAN grey-hounds, Dutch lap-dogs, monkeys, and maccaws,
have been honoured with monuments and epi∣taphs: But a race-horse as much
surpasses these insignificant animals, as WHITE-NOSE was superior
to a pack-horse: and I cannot but think, that an obelisk (with a proper
inscrip∣tion drawn up by Messieurs <HI>Heber</HI> and <HI>Pond)</HI>
should be erected near the <HI>Devil's Ditch,</HI> or <HI>Choak-Jade,</HI> on
<HI>New∣market Heath,</HI> in honour of his memory. With what rapture might we
then read of his <HI>powerful deep rate,</HI> by which all the horses that
ran against him were <HI>no-where</HI>; of his rapid victories in the field,
(more surprizing than those of the Duke of <HI>Marlborough,)</HI> by which
he WON <HI>Tewksbury,</HI> WON <HI>Chipping-Norton,</HI> WON
<HI>Lincoln,</HI> WON <HI>York,</HI> &amp;c. But, above all, we should admire
the noble BLOOD which flowed in his veins, and with reverence contemplate the
illustrious names of his great, great, great, great, great grandsires and
grandams. There is not the least <HI>flaw</HI> in the BLOOD of WHITE-NOSE's
family: and his epitaph might conclude, in imitation of that famous one on the
Duke of <HI>Newcastle</HI>'s monument, 
<Q REND="inline">"that all the Sons were remarkable Stallions,
and all the Daughters excel∣lent Breeders."</Q></P>
<P>THE pedigrees of our race-horses have been always
preserved with as much care and exactness, as the Tree of Descent among
the family of a <HI>Spanish</HI> grandee or <HI>Polish</HI> nobleman: nor
does the <HI>Welchman</HI> derive greater honour from proving himself the
fiftieth cousin to <HI>Cadwallader</HI> or <HI>Caractacus,</HI> through a
long line of <HI>David Ap Shenkins, Ap Morgans, Ap Powells, Ap Prices,</HI>
than the horse by being <PB N="375" REF="382"/> half brother to the
<HI>Godolphin Barb,</HI> or full cousin by the dam's side to the <HI>Bloody
Shoulder'd Arabian.</HI> The <HI>Romans</HI> were no less curious in the
breed of their horses, and paid the greatest honours to those that beat
the whole <HI>Circus hollow.</HI> They even erectred monuments to their memory,
of which <HI>Lipsuis</HI> gives us the following remarkable instance.
<HI>Clarissimè lapis vetus, quem Romae olim vidi et exscripsi.
In medio vir est, qui dextrâ baculum, sinistrâ pabulum tenet:
extrinsecus duo sunt assilientes equi cum geminâ
inscriptione</HI>;—AQUILO, <HI>Nepos Aquilonis vicit</HI> cxxx.
<HI>secundas tulit</HI> lxxxviii. <HI>tertias tulit</HI>
xxxvii.—<HI>Altera,</HI>—HIRPINUS, <HI>Nepos Aquilonis vicit</HI>
cxiv. <HI>secundas tulit</HI> lvi, <HI>tertias tulit</HI> xxxvi. <HI>Habes
itaque ipsum hìc</HI> HIRPINUM, <HI>atque adeo ejus avum</HI>
AQUILONEM. I could wish that the same honours were paid to our horses: I
would at least propose, that the the names, pedi∣grees, and a list of the
plates won by victorious horses should be inscribed on the posts of all
courses, where they have made themselves famous. These memorials might
serve to perpetuate the renown of our racers, and would furnish posterity
with a more complete history of the Turf than the <HI>Sportsman</HI>'s
<HI>Calendar.</HI></P>
<P>YOU will undoubtedly observe, Mr. TOWN, that in the extract
concerning horses, with which I have just pre∣sented you from
<HI>Lipsius,</HI> a man is also mentioned; the account of whom would, if
modernized, run in the follow∣ing terms. 
<Q REND="inline">"In the middle of the monument stood a man,
with a whip in his right hand, and a feed of corn in his left."</Q> Hence it
appears, that the <HI>Romans</HI> intended to do honour to the charioteer as
well as the horses; and it is a pity, that we do not also imitate them in
this particular, and pay equal respect to our Jockeys. <PB N="376" REF="383"/>
The chariot-race was not more celebrated among the Ancients, than the
horse-race is at present; and the <HI>Circus</HI> at <HI>Rome</HI> never
drew together so noble an assembly as the modern course. Nor do I see
any reason, why <HI>Theron</HI> should be more applauded for carrying off
the prize at <HI>Elis</HI> or <HI>Pisa,</HI> than <HI>Tom Marshal</HI> for
winning the plate at <HI>York</HI> or <HI>Newmarket.</HI> The charioteers of
old were, in∣deed, composed of the greatest princes, and persons of the
first rank, who prided themselves on their dexterity in managing the reins,
and driving their own chariots. In this they have been imitated by several of
our mo∣dern gentry, who value themselves in being excellent coachmen. And it
is with infinite pleasure, that I have lately observed persons of
fashion at all races affect the dress and manner of grooms. And as
gentlemen, like the ancient charioteers, begin to enter the race themselves,
and ride their own horses, it is probable that we shall soon see the
best jockeys among the first of our nobility.</P>
<P>THAT the encomiums of the horse should so frequently be
enlarged on, without entering into the praises of the Jockey, is indeed
something wonderful; when we consider how much the beast is under his
direction, and that the strength and fleetness of <HI>Victorious</HI> or
<HI>Driver</HI> would be of no use without the skill and honesty of the
rider. Large sums have been lost by a horse running, accidentally without
doubt, on the wrong side of the post; and We Knowing Ones, Mr. TOWN, have
frequently seen great dexterity and management exerted, in contriving that
one of the best horses in the field should be distanced. The Joc∣key
has indeed so great a share in the success of the race, 
<PB N="377" REF="384"/> that every man, who has ever betted five pounds, is
ac∣quainted with his consequence, and does not want to be told, that the
victory depends at least as often on the rider as the horse.</P>
<P>I CANNOT help agreeing with Lady <HI>Pentweazle</HI> in the
farce, that 
<Q REND="inline">"if there was as much care taken in the breed
of the human species, as there is in that of dogs and of horses, we
should not have so many puny half-formed animals as we daily see among
us:"</Q> and indeed every thorough sportsman very well knows, that as much
art is required in bringing up a Jockey, as the beast he is to ride. In every
respect the same care must be had to keep him in wind; and he must be
in like manner dieted, put in sweats, and exercised to bring him down to a
proper weight. Much depends upon the size of the man as well as horse: for
a rider of the same dimensions with a grenadier would no more be fit to
come upon the Turf as a Jockey, than an awkward thing taken out of the shafts
of a dray could ever appear at the starting-post as a race-horse. This is
obvious to every one; and I could not help smiling at what my landlord at the
<HI>White Bear</HI> said the other day to a fellow-commoner of <HI>St.
John</HI>'s, (who would fain be thought a Knowing One) by way of compliment: 
<Q REND="inline">"My worthy master, said the landlord, it
is a thousand pities you should be a gownsman, when you would have made
such a special postboy or jockey."</Q></P>
<P>MY chief inducement to write to you at present, Mr. TOWN,
was to desire you to use your endeavours to bring the Jockey into equal
esteem with the animal he bestrides; and to beg that you would promote the
settling an esta∣blished <PB N="378" REF="385"/> scheme for the
preservation of his breed. In order to this I would humbly propose, that a
stud for the Jockeys should be immediately built near the stables at
<HI>Newmarket,</HI> and that their genealogies should be duly registered;
that the breed should be crossed, as occasion might require; and that
the best horsemen and of the lightest weights should intermarry with
the full sisters of those who had won most plates; and in a word the
same methods used for the improve∣ment of the Jockeys as their horses. I
have here sent you the exact pedigree of a famous Jockey, taken with all that
care just now prescribed; and I doubt not if my scheme was univer∣sally
put in execution, but we should excel all other nations in our horsemen, as
we already do in our horses.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="body of issue">
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">R</SEG>ETURNING the other night from the coffee∣house, where I had
just been reading the Votes, I found myself on a sudden op∣pressed
with a drowsiness, that seemed to promise me as sound a repose in
my great chair, as my dog already enjoyed by the fire-side. I willingly
indulged it, and had hardly closed my eyes before I fell into the following
dream.</P>
<P>METHOUGHT the door of my room on a sudden flew open, and
admitted a great variety of Dogs of all sorts and sizes, from the mastiff
to the lapdog. I was sur∣prized at this appearance, but my amazement was much
<PB N="380" REF="387"/> encreased, when I saw a large Grey-hound advancing
towards me, and heard him thus address me in a hu∣man voice.</P>
<Q> 
<P> YOU cannot, Sir, be ignorant of the panic that pre∣vails among
all our species, on account of a scheme now on foot for our destruction.
That slaughter, which was formerly made among the wolves of this land, and in
which our ancestors bore so large a share, is now going to be revived
among us. I, for my own part, have no hopes of escaping, as you will easily
judge when you hear my case. My master owes his sub∣sistence to his
labour, and with his wages can just main∣tain me and his three children. In
return, I now and then afford him a comfortable meal, by killing him a rabbit
in the squire's warren, or picking him up a hare on a <HI>Sunday</HI>
morning. The other services I render him are of equal importance to him and
pleasure to myself. I am his constant companion to the field in the
morning, and back again at night: he knows that his cloaths and his wallet are
safe in my keeping; and he is sure to be rouzed on any midnight alarm, when
I am in the house.</P> 
<P> IT is with horror I reflect on the numbers of my relations, who
will swing their last, and against whom this law seems indeed to be
levelled. Is it not enough that our merits are neglected, and thought inferior
to those of a slow-footed race, who inhabit a spacious ken∣nel in the
squire's yard, and who are as many hours in killing a hare, as we are
minutes? Yet they are kept by the great, attended by the noble, and every day
treat∣ed <PB N="381" REF="388"/> with horse-flesh: while I live among the
poor, am threatned by the rich, and now probably shall be de∣stroyed by
public authority.</P> 
<P> I CANNOT deny, but that the favour of the ladies is frequently
extended to a small and degenerate race; who, tho' they bear our name, may
very properly be stiled the <HI>Fribbles</HI> of our Species. 'Tis true, they
are of foreign extraction, which alone is sufficient merit, and seem indeed
to be as much preferred by the <HI>Beau Monde</HI> to our <HI>English</HI>
greyhounds, as their countrymen in the <HI>Haymarket</HI> are to our
<HI>English</HI> singers. But tho' this breed is so diminutive, that I
myself have coursed one of them for a hare, yet I will venture to
pronounce, that be the tax what it will, not a <HI>Fido</HI> in the land will
be sacrificed to the laws.</P> 
<P> OUR request to you is to display our merits to the world
and convince mankind of the innocence of our intentions, and the hardships
that we already labour un∣der. Though I have enlarged on my own case; I have
the honour to address you in the name of all my brethren; such of them, I
mean, as think themselves endangered by this scheme for our destruction.
At the same time we desire you to apprize the Public of the hazard they may
run by coming to an open rupture; since, in such a case, the Mastiffs
and the Bull Dogs are determined to join their forces, and will sell their
lives at the dearest rate.</P> </Q>
<P>THIS last resolution was confirmed by a general growl. After
which I was thus accosted by another of the company, of the
Pointing-breed.</P>
<Q><PB N="382" REF="389"/> 
<P> LITTLE did I think, that the pains I have taken, and the
blows I have suffered, to perfect me in the art I profess, would have been
thus requited. Having lost the best of masters by an accident from his
gun, which I can scarce ever think of without a howl, I have now, like my
friend <HI>Smoker,</HI> the misfortune to live with a poor man. A misfortune I
now call it, since alas! he will not be able to save me from the halter, by
paying my ransom. He too, I am afraid, will be reduced to beggary; since at
present, I and his gun are his chief support. If he is deprived of me, and
thereby pre∣vented from what the rich maliciously term <HI>poaching,</HI> his
best resource will be to dispatch himself with his gun before he
surrenders it, or to hang himself with the same rope that ties up me.
When I was a puppy, I was every day fed in the kitchen, and caressed in the
parlour; and I have now a brother, that always points for the best of
company. What though our race has been frequently reproached? What though we,
together with the Spaniels, have been accused, I do not say wrongfully, of
crouching to our enemies, and licking the hand that beats us? Is not this every
day practised among your species, and is it not countenanced by the
greatest examples? In fawning and flattering we are by no means singular,
and crouching and cringing are not confined to the brute species.</P> 
<P> I VERY heartily second the request of my friend, and
doubt not but the arguments you will use in our behalf will be able to divert
the storm that threatens us. This, you may be assured of, that if my life
is spared through your means, it shall be devoted to your service; 
<PB N="383" REF="390"/> and you shall sup, as often as you please, oh a
brace of birds.</P></Q>
<P>THIS speech was attended with a bark of applause; and I was
next accosted by a Lap-Dog, who, after dolefully shaking his ears, began
the following harangue.— 
<Q REND="inline">"Though I am aware that many of my species
will re∣main unhurt by this scheme devised for our destruction, yet I
have on my own account great reason to be alarmed. I was born indeed in a
noble family in <HI>St. James</HI>'s square, but unfortunately was within
these three months resigned over to my present mistress, an old maid,
who had been through her whole life as frugal of her money as her favours. She
is indeed so very saving, that I have more than once been beat for lapping
up her breakfast cream, and it was but last week that I was severely
corrected for devouring a sheep's heart, for which she had been to market
herself. Such a mistress will undoubtedly sacrifice me to this cruel
tax; and though you may perhaps imagine the loss of life in these
circumstances is not much to be regretted, yet death is a terrible remedy,
and a living dog is better than a dead lion. But if some of our species
must perish, surely a regard should be had to national merit; and the
storm should first fall on those foreign intruders, who by the
flatness of their noses are supposed to be of <HI>Dutch</HI>
extraction. If the ladies also have any regard to the honour of their
country, or any love remaining for Us, it becomes them to take our case into
consideration. And I make no doubt, since <HI>The</HI> FEMALE PARLIAMENT is
now sitting, but if you, Sir, would draw up a petition in our favour; as the
other sex have taken neccessary <PB N="384" REF="391"/> precautions for
the preservation of the Game, the ladies would in their turn bring in a bill
for the preservation of Lap-Dogs."</Q></P>
<P>VARIOUS were the arguments that many others used in their own
behalf. The Mastiff insisted on the Protec∣tion he afforded us, and the
terror he struck into thieves and house-breakers. King <HI>Charles</HI>'s
black favourites came fawn∣ing upon me, and hoped that their breed might be
pre∣served in deference to the taste of so witty a monarch. I could not
help smiling at the argument made use of by a Bull-Dog from
<HI>Norfolk:</HI> who declared that he was so instru∣mental to the mirth of
the county, that he firmly believed, they would never part with him; but begged
at the same time that, if sentence <HI>must</HI> pass, it might be
changed into banishment, and that <HI>Spain</HI> might be the place of his
transportation.</P>
<P>THE eloquence and gesture of my four-footed visiters had
such an influence over me, that I was just going to answer them in the
manner they could wish; when my own Dog on a sudden jumped into my lap, and
rouzed me from my dream.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>S no one has a greater respect for the fair sex than
myself, I was highly pleased with a letter inserted some time ago in
your pa∣per, ridiculing the detestable use of paint among the ladies. This
practice is indeed too general; and for my part, when I meet with a bloom∣ing
fresh-coloured face in town, I no more take it for the real face belonging to
the lady, than I imagine Queen <HI>Anne</HI>'s portrait delineated on a
sign-post to be Her Ma∣jedy's flesh and blood.</P>
<P><PB N="386" REF="393"/>BUT this fashion is not confined to
the ladies. I am ashamed to tell you that we are indebted to <HI>Spanish
Wool</HI> for many of our masculine ruddy complexions. A pretty fellow
lackers his pale face with as many varnishes as a fine lady; and it is well
known that late hours at the card-table, amusements at <HI>Haddock</HI>'s,
immoderate draughts of Champagne, and sleeping all night upon a bulk, will
strip the most healthy complexion of its roses. Therefore to repair the
loss, they are obliged to substitute the unwholesome disguise of
art, for the native hue of a vigorous constitution.</P>
<P>I MUST leave it to you, Mr. TOWN, or your inge∣nious
correspondent to enlarge upon this subject; and will only just appeal to
the ladies, whether a smooth fair face is a proper recommendation of a man to
their favour, and whether they do not look on those of the other sex as a
contemptible sort of rivals, who aspire to be thought charming and pretty?
As many females are also conscious that they themselves endeavour to
conceal by art the defects of nature, they are apt to suspect those of
our sex, who are so very sollicitous to set off their persons: and
indeed I fear it will be found upon examination that our pretty fellows, who
lay on Carmine, are painting a rotten post.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>I am, Sir, Your humble Servant, W.
MANLY.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>MANY of my readers will, I dare say, be hard∣ly persuaded
that this custom could have ever pre∣vailed as a branch of male foppery: but
it is too <PB N="387" REF="394"/> notorious that our fine gentlemen, in many
other instances besides the article of paint, affect the softness and
deli∣cacy of the fair sex. The male beauty has his washes, perfumes, and
cosmetics; and takes as much pains to set a gloss on his complexion, as
the footman in japan∣ning his shoes. He has his dressing-room and (which
is still more ridiculous) his Toilette too; at which he sits as many hours
repairing his battered countenance, as a decayed toast dressing for a
birth-night. I had once an opportunity of taking a survey of one of these
Male-Toilettes; and as such a curiosity may perhaps prove entertaining to
many of my readers, I shall here give a description of it.</P>
<P>HAVING occasion one morning to wait on a very pretty fellow, I
was desired by the <HI>Valet de Cham∣bre</HI> to walk into the dressing
room, till his master was stirring. I was accordingly shewn into a neat
little cham∣ber, hung round with <HI>India</HI> paper, and adorned with
several little images of pagods and bramins, and vessels of <HI>Chelsea
China,</HI> in which were set various-coloured sprigs of artificial
flowers. But the Toilette most excited my admiration; where I found every
thing was intended to be agreeable to the <HI>Chinese</HI> taste. A
looking-glass en∣closed in a whimsical frame of <HI>Chinese</HI>
paling, stood upon a <HI>Japan</HI> table, over which was spread a coverlid
of the finest chints. I could not but observe a number of boxes of
different sizes, which were all of them <HI>Japan,</HI> and were regularly
disposed on the table. I had the curiosity to examine the contents of
several, and in one I found lip-salve; in another a roll of pigtail; and in
another the ladies black sticking plaister: but the last which I opened 
<PB N="388" REF="395"/> very much surprised me, as I found nothing in it but
a number of little pills. I likewise remarked in one part of the table a
tooth-brush and spunge with a pot of <HI>Delascot</HI>'s opiate, and on
the other side water for the eyes: in the mid∣dle stood a bottle of <HI>Eau
de Luce,</HI> and a roll of perfumed pomatum: almond pastes, powder-puffs,
hair combs, brushes, nippers, and the like, made up the rest of this
fantastic equi∣page: but among many other wimsies, I could not conceive for
what use a very small ivory comb could be designed, till the valet
informed me, that it was a comb for the eye-brows.</P>
<P>IT must be confessed, that there are some men of such
a delicate make and silky constitution, that it is no wonder if gentlemen
of such a lady-like generation have a natu∣ral tendency to the refinements
and softnesses of fe∣males. These tender dear creatures are generally
bred up immediately under the wing of their mamas, and scarce fed with any
thing less innocent than her milk. They are never permitted to study,
least it should hurt their eyes, and make their heads ache; nor suffered
to use any exercises, like other boys, least a fine hand should be
spoiled by being used too roughly. While other lads are flogged into the
five declensions, and at length lashed through a whole school, these
pretty masters are kept at home to improve in whip-sillabubs, pastry, and
<HI>face-painting.</HI> In consequence of which, when other young fellows
begin to appear like men, these dainty creatures come into the world, with
all the accomplishments of a lady's woman.</P>
<P>BUT if these common foibles of the female world are ridiculous
even in these equivocal half-men, these neuter <PB N="389" REF="396"/>
somethings between male and female, how awkardly must they sit upon the
more robust and masculine part of mankind? What indeed can be more
absurd, than to see a huge fellow with the make of a porter, and fit to
mount the stage as a champion at <HI>Broughton</HI>'s Amphitheatre, sitting
to varnish his broad face with paint and <HI>Benjamin</HI>-wash? For my
part I never see a great looby aiming at <HI>delicatesse,</HI> but it
seems as strange and uncouth a figure as <HI>Achilles</HI> in petticoats.
This folly is also to be particularly condemned, when it appears in the more
solemn characters of life, to which a gravity of ap∣pearance is
essential; and in which the least marks of fop∣pery seem as improper,
as a physician would seem ridiculous prescribing in a bag-wig, or a
serjeant pleading at the <HI>King</HI>'s <HI>Bench</HI> in his own hair
instead of a night-cap periwig. As I think an instance or two of this kind
would shew this folly in the most striking light, I shall here
subjoin two characters, in whom as it is most improper, it will
consequently appear most ridiculous.</P>
<P>JOHN HARDMAN is upwards of six feet high, and stout enough
to beat two of the sturdiest chairmen that ever came out of
<HI>Ireland.</HI> Nature indeed seems to have intended <HI>John</HI>
himself to carry a chair, but fortune has enabled him to appear in whatever
character he likes best, and he has wisely discover∣ed, that none will
sit so easy on him as that of a pretty fellow. It is therefore his
study to new-mould his face, and person: He throws his goggle eyes into
leers, languishes and ogles; and endeavours to draw up his hideous mouth,
that extends from one ear to the other, into a simper. His voice, which is
naturally of a deeper base than an hurdy-gurdy, is in a manner set to a new
tune: and his speech, which is very much tinctured with the broad dialect of
a particular county, <PB N="390" REF="397"/> is delivered with so much nicety
and gentleness, that every word is minced and clipt in order to appear soft
and delicate. When he walks, he endeavours to move his unwieldy figure along in
the pert trip, or easy shambling pace of our pretty fellows; and commonly
carries a thin jemmy stick in his hand, which naturally reminds us of
<HI>Hercules</HI> with a distaff.</P>
<P>THE Reverend Mr. JESSAMY, (who took orders only because there
was a good living in the family,) is known among the ladies by the name of the
Beau-Parson. He is in∣deed the most delicate creature imaginable; and
differs so much from the generality of the clergy, that I believe the very
sight of a plumb-pudding would make him swoon. Out of his Canonicals, his
constant dress is what they call Parson's-Blue, lined with white; a black
sattin waistcoat, velvet breeches, and silk stockings: his pumps are of
dog-skin made by <HI>Tull</HI>; and it is said that he had a joint of one
of his toes cut off, whose length being out of all proportion, prevented his
having a handsome foot. His very grizzle is scarce ortho∣dox: for, though
it would be open schism to wear a bag, yet his wig has always a bag-front,
and is properly cropped behind, that it may not eclipse the lustre of his
diamond stock-buckle. He cannot bear the thoughts of being sea-sick; or
else he declares he would certainly go abroad, where he might again resume
his laced cloaths, and appear like a gentleman in a bag-wig, and sword.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>MONG the many exotic diversions, that have been
transplanted into this country, there is no one more cultivated, or which
seems to have taken deeper root among us, than that modest and rational
entertain∣ment, the Masquerade. This, as well as the Opera, is originally of
<HI>Italian</HI> growth; and was brought over hither by the celebrated
<HI>Heidegger,</HI> who thence justly acquired among his own countrymen the
honourable title of <HI>Sur∣intendant des plaisirs d' Angleterre.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="392" REF="399"/>I HAVE called the Masquerade a modest
and rational entertainment. As to the first, no one can have the least
scruple about its innocence, if he considers, that it is al∣ways made a
part of the education of our polite females; and that the most virtuous woman
is not ashamed to ap∣pear there. If it be objected, that a lady is exposed
to hear many indecencies from the men, (as the mask gives them a privilege to
say any thing, though ever so rude) it may be answered, that no lady is
obliged to take the affront to herself; because, as she goes
disguised, the indignity is not offered to her in her own proper person.
Besides, ac∣cording to Dryden, 
<Q> 
<L>She cannot blush, because they cannot see.</L></Q></P>
<P>AS to the rationality of this entertainment, every one will
agree with me, that these midnight orgies are full as rational as sitting
up all night at the card-table. Nor is it more strange, that five or six
hundred people should meet together in disguises purposely to conceal
themselves, than that the same number should assemble at a route,
where most of the company are wholly unacquainted with each other.</P>
<P>BUT we can never enough admire the wit and hu∣mour of these
meetings; which greatly consists in exhi∣biting the most fantastic
appearances, that the most whim∣sical imagination can possibly
devise. A common person may be content with appearing as a Chinese, a
Turk, or a Fryar; but the true genius will ransack earth, air, and seas,
reconcile contradictions, and call in things inanimate, as well as animate, to
his assistance: and the more extra∣vagant and out of nature his dress
can be contrived, the <PB N="393" REF="400"/> higher is the joke. I remember one
gentleman above six foot high, who came to the masquerade drest, like a
child, in a white frock and leading strings, attended by another gentleman of
exceeding low stature, who offici∣ated as his nurse. The same witty
spark took it into his head at another time to personate Fame, and was
stuck all over with peacock-feathers by way of eyes: but when he came to
fasten on his wings, they were spread to so enormous a length, that no
coach or chair was spacious enough to admit him; so that he was forced to
be conveyed along the streets on a chair∣man's horse, covered with a
blanket. Another gen∣tleman of no less humour very much surprised the
com∣pany by carrying a thatched house about him; which was so contrived,
that no part of him could be seen, except his face, which was looking out of
the casement: but this joke had like to have cost him dear, as another wag
was going to set fire to the building, because he found, by the leaden
policy affixed to the front, that the tenement was insured. In a word, dogs,
monkeys, ostriches, and all kinds of monitors, are as frequently to be met
with at the masquerade, as in the <HI>Covent-Garden</HI> pantomimes: and I
once saw with great delight a gentleman (who personated one of
<HI>Bayes</HI>'s recruits) prance a minuet on his hobby-horse, with a dancing
bear for his partner.</P>
<P>I HAVE said before, that the Masquerade is of foreign
extraction, and imported to us from abroad. But as the <HI>English,</HI>
though slow at invention, are remarkable for im∣proving on what has already
been invented, it is no wonder that we should attempt to heighten the gusto
of this enter∣tainment, and even carry it beyond the licence of a foreign 
<PB N="394" REF="401"/> Carnival. There is something too insipid in our fine
gentle∣men stalking about in dominos; and it is rather cruel to eclipse the
pretty faces of our fine ladies with hideous masks: for which reasons it
has been judged requisite to contrive a masquerade upon a new plan, and in
an entire new taste. We may all remember, when (a few years ago) a celebrated
lady endeavoured to introduce a new species of Masquerade among us, by
lopping off the exuberance of dress: and she herself first set the
example, by stripping to the character of <HI>Iphigenia</HI> undrest for
the sacrifice. I must own, it is a matter of some surprize to me
(considering the propensity of our modern ladies to get rid of their
cloaths,) that other <HI>Iphigenias</HI> did not immediately start up, or
that nuns and vestals should be suffered ever after to be seen among
the masks. But this project, it seems, was not then sufficiently ripe for
execution, as a certain aukward thing, called Bashfulness, had not yet been
banished from the female world: and to the present enlightened times was
reserved the honour of introducing (however contradictory the term may
seem) a NAKED MASQUERADE.</P>
<P>WHAT the above-mentioned lady had the hardiness to attempt
alone, will (I am assured) be set on foot by our persons of fashion,
as soon as the hot days come in. <HI>Ra∣nelagh.</HI> is the place pitched
upon for their meeting; where it is proposed to have a Masquerade <HI>Al
Fresco,</HI> and the whole company is to display all their charms <HI>in
puris natura∣libus.</HI> The <HI>Pantheon of the Heathen Gods, Ovid's
Metamor∣phoses,</HI> and <HI>Titian's Prints</HI> will supply them with a
sufficient variety of undrest characters. One set of ladies, I am told,
intend to personate <HI>Water-Nymphs</HI> bathing in the canal: 
<PB N="395" REF="402"/> three sisters, celebrated for their charms, design
to appear together as the <HI>Three Graces</HI>; and a certain lady of quality,
who most resembles the Goddess of Beauty, is now practising from a
model of the noted statue of <HI>Venus de Medicis,</HI> the most striking
attitudes for that character. As to the gentlemen, they may most of them
represent very suitably the half-brutal forms of <HI>Satyrs, Pans,
Fauns,</HI> and <HI>Centaurs:</HI> our beaux may assume the semblance of
the beardless <HI>Apollo,</HI> or (which would be more natural) may admire
themselves in the person of <HI>Narcissus:</HI> and our bucks might act
quite in character, by running about stark-naked with their
mis∣tresses, and committing the maddest freaks, like the Priests and
Priestesses of <HI>Bacchus,</HI> celebrating the <HI>Bacchanalian</HI>
mysteries.</P>
<P>IF this scheme for a Naked Masquerade should meet with
encouragement, (as there is no doubt but it must,) it is proposed to
improve it still further. Persons of fashion cannot but lament, that
there are no diversions allotted to Sunday, except the card-table; and they
can never enough regret, that the Sunday evening tea-drinkings at
<HI>Ranelagh</HI> were laid aside, from a superstitious regard to
religion. They therefore intend to have a particular sort of Masque∣rade on
that day, in which they may shew their taste by ridiculing all the old
womens tales contained in that idle book of fables, the Bible; while the vulgar
are devoutly attending to them at church. This, indeed, is not with∣out a
parallel: we have had an instance already of an <HI>Eve</HI>; and by
borrowing the serpent in <HI>Orpheus</HI> and <HI>Eurydice,</HI> we might
have the whole story of the Fall of Man exhi∣bited in a Masquerade.</P>
<P><PB N="396" REF="403"/>IT must, indeed, be acknowledged, that
this project has already taken place among the lowest of the people, who
seem to have been the first contrivers of a Naked Masquerade: and last
summer I remember an article in the news-papers, that 
<Q REND="inline">"several persons of both sexes were
assembled naked at <HI>Pimlico,</HI> and being carried before a
magistrate were sent to Bridewell."</Q> This, indeed, is too refined a
pleasure to be allowed the vulgar: and every body will agree with me, that
the same act, which at the <HI>Green Lamps,</HI> or <HI>Pimlico</HI> appears
low and criminal, may be polite, and extremely commendable at the
<HI>Haymarket</HI> or at <HI>Ranelagh.</HI></P>

shall make it the en∣tertainment of to-day: and I flatter myself it will
not be disagreeable to my readers.</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>To Mr. TOWN.</HEAD>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>SIR!</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>BAYES in the <HI>Rehearsal</HI> frequently boasts it as
his chief excellence that he treads on no man's heels, that he scorns to
follow the steps of others; and when he is asked the reason of
inserting any absurdity in his play, he answers, <HI>because it is
new.</HI> The poets of the present time run into the contrary error: they are
so far from endea∣vouring to elevate and surprize by any thing original,
that <PB N="398" REF="405"/> their whole business is imitation; and they
jingle their bells in the same road with those that went before them, with
all the dull exactness of a packhorse.</P>
<P>THE generality of our writers wait till a new walk is pointed
out to them by some leading genius, when it im∣mediately becomes so
hackney'd and beaten, that an author of credit is almost ashamed to appear
in it among such bad company. No sooner does one man of parts succeed in
any particular mode of writing, but he is followed by a thousand dunces. A
good elegy makes the little scribblers direct their whole bent to subjects
of grief, and, for a whole winter, the press groans with melancholy. One
novel of reputation fills all the garrets of <HI>Grub Street</HI> with whole
reams of histories and adventures, where volume is spun out after volume,
without the least wit, humour, or incident. In a word, as <HI>Bayes</HI>
obviated all objections to his nonsense by saying <HI>it was new,</HI> if
a modern writer was asked why he chose any particular manner of writing, he
might reply, <HI>because it is the fashion.</HI></P>
<P>TRUE genius will not give into such idle extravagant flights
of imagination as <HI>Bayes,</HI> it will not turn funerals into banquets, or
introduce armies in disguise: but still it will not confine itself to
the narrow track of imitation. I cannot help thinking that it is more owing to
this servile spirit in the authors of the present time, than to their
want of abili∣ties, that we cannot now boast a set of eminent writers: And
it is worthy observation that whenever any age has been distinguished by
a great number of excellent authors, they have most of them cultivated
<HI>different</HI> branches of poe∣try from each other. This was the case in
the age of <HI>Au∣gustus,</HI> <PB N="399" REF="406"/> as appears from the
works of <HI>Virgil, Horace, Ovid,</HI> &amp;c. And to come down as late as
possible, this is evident from our last famous set of authors, who
flourished in the beginning of this century. We admire <HI>Swift, Pope, Gay,
Bolinbroke, Addison,</HI> &amp;c. but we admire each for his particular
beauties, separate and distinguished from the rest.</P>
<P>I FEAR Mr. TOWN, that my letter will appear too vague and
unconnected; but these loose thoughts were thrown to∣gether merely to
introduce the following little poem, which I think deserves the attention of
the Public. It was writ∣ten by a very ingenious gentleman, as a letter to a
friend, who was about to publish a volume of miscellanies; and contains all
that original spirit, which it so elegantly re∣commends.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE various seasons of the year produce not a greater
alteration in the face of nature, than in the polite manner of passing our
time. The diversions of winter and summer are as diffe∣rent as the dog-days
and those at <HI>Christmas</HI>; nor do I know any genteel amusement,
ex∣cept Gaming, that prevails during the whole year. As the long days are now
coming on, the theatrical gentry, who contribute to dissipate the gloom of
our winter evenings, begin to divide themselves into strolling companies;
and are packing up their tragedy wardrobes, together with a sufficient
quantity of thun∣der and lightning, for the delight and amazement of the
coun∣try. In the mean time the several public Gardens near this me∣tropolis
are trimming their trees, levelling their walks, and bur∣nishing their lamps,
for our reception. At <HI>Vaux-hall</HI> (which is already opened) the
artificial ruins are repaired; the cascade is made to spout with several
additional streams of block-tin; <PB N="404" REF="411"/> and they have touched
up all the pictures, which were da∣maged last season by the fingering of
those curious Con∣noisseurs, who could not be satisfied without
<HI>feeling</HI> whether the figures were alive. The magazine at
<HI>Cuper</HI>'s, I am told, is furnished with an extraordinary supply of
gunpowder, to be shot off in squibs and sky-rockets, or whirled away in
blaz∣ing suns and <HI>Catherine</HI> wheels. And it is not to be doubted, in
case of a war, but that <HI>Neptune</HI> and all his <HI>Tritons</HI> will
as∣sist the <HI>British</HI> navy; and as we before took
<HI>Porto-Bello</HI> and <HI>Cape Breton,</HI> we shall gain new victories
over the <HI>French</HI> fleet every night upon that canal.</P>
<P>HAPPY are they, who can muster up sufficient, at least to
hire tickets at the door, once or twice in a season! Not that these
pleasures are confined to the rich and the great only; for the lower sort
of people have their <HI>Ranelaghs</HI> and their <HI>Vaux∣halls</HI> as well
as the quality. <HI>Perrot</HI>'s inimitable Grotto may be seen for only
calling for a pot of beer; and the royal di∣version of duck-hunting, may be
had into the bargain, toge∣ther with a decanter of <HI>Dorchester,</HI> for
your six-pence at <HI>Jenny</HI>'s <HI>Whim.</HI> Every skettle-alley half
a mile out of town is embellished with green arbours and shady retreats;
where the company is generally entertained with the melodious scraping of a
blind fiddler. And who can resist the luscious temptation of a fine juicy
ham, or a delicious buttock of beef stuffed with parsley, accompanied with
a foaming decanter of sparkling home-brew'd, which is so invitingly painted
at the entrance of almost every village ale-house?</P>
<P>OUR Northern climate will not, indeed, allow us to in∣dulge
ourselves in all those pleasures of a garden, which are so feelingly
described by our poets. We dare not lay our∣selves on the damp ground in
shady groves, or by the purl∣ing stream, but are obliged to fortify our
insides against the cold by good substantial eating and drinking. For
this reason the extreme costliness of the provisions at our public
Gardens has been grievously complained of by those gentry, to whom a
supper at these places is as necessary a part of the entertain∣ment as
the singing or the fireworks. Poor Mr. <HI>John</HI> sees with an heavy
heart the profits of a whole week's card-money de∣voured in tarts and
cheese-cakes by Mrs. House-keeper or Mrs. Lady's own Woman: and the
substantial cit, who comes from behind the counter two or three evenings in
the sum∣mer, can never enough regret the thin wafer-like slices of beef and
ham, that taste of nothing but the knife.</P>
<P><PB N="405" REF="412"/>I WAS greatly diverted last Saturday
evening at <HI>Vaux-hall</HI> with the shrewd remarks made on this very head
by an honest citizen; whose wife and two daughters had, I found, pre∣vailed
on him to carry them to the Garden. As I thought there was something curious
in their behaviour, I went into the next box to them, where I had an
opportunity of seeing and over-hearing every thing that past.</P>
<P>AFTER some talk,— 
<Q REND="inline">"Come, come, (said the old don) it is high
time, I think, to go to supper."</Q> To this the ladies readily assented;
and one of the misses said, 
<Q REND="inline">"do let us have a chick, papa."</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">"Zounds (said the father) they are half a
crown a-piece, and no bigger than a sparrow."</Q> Here the old lady took him
up— 
<Q REND="inline">"You are so stingy, Mr. <HI>Rose,</HI>
there is no bearing you. When one is out upon pleasure, I love to appear like
somebody: and what signifies a few shillings once and away, when a body
is about it?"</Q> This reproof so effectually silenced the old gentleman,
that the youngest miss had the courage to put in a word for some ham
likewise: Accordingly the waiter was called, and dispatched by the old lady
with an order for a chicken and a plate of ham. When it was brought, our
honest cit twirled the dish about three or four times, and surveyed it
with a very settled counte∣nance; then taking up the slice of ham, and
dangling it to and fro on the end of his fork, asked the waiter, 
<Q REND="inline">"how much there was of it."</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">"A shilling's worth, Sir,"</Q> said the
fellow. 
<Q REND="inline">"—Prithee, said the don, how much dost
think it weighs?—An ounce?—A shilling an ounce! that is sixteen
shil∣lings <HI>per</HI> pound!—A reasonable profit truly!—Let
me see—suppose now the whole ham weighs thirty pounds:—at a
shilling <HI>per</HI> ounce, that is, sixteen shillings <HI>per</HI>
pound, why your master makes exactly twenty-four pounds of every ham; and if
he buys them at the best hand, and salts them and cures them himself,
they don't stand him in ten shil∣lings a-piece."</Q> The old lady bade him
hold his nonsense, declared herself ashamed for him, and asked him if
people must not live: then taking a coloured handkerchief from her own neck,
she tucked it into his shirt-collar, whence it hung like a bib, and helped
him to a leg of the chicken. The old gentleman, at every bit he put in his
mouth, amused himself with saying, — 
<Q REND="inline">"there goes two-pence—there goes
three-pence—there goes a groat.—Zounds a man at these places
should not have a swallow so wide as a tom-tit."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="406" REF="413"/>THIS scanty repast, we may imagine,
was soon dispatched; and it was with much difficulty our citizen was
prevailed on to suffer a plate of beef to be ordered. This too was no less
admired, and underwent the same comments with the ham: at length, when only a
very small bit was left, as they say, for manners in the dish, our don
took a piece of an old news∣paper out of his pocket, and gravely wrapping up
the meat in it placed it carefully in his letter case. 
<Q REND="inline">"I'll keep thee as a curiosity to my dying
day; and I'll show thee to my neighbour <HI>Horseman,</HI> and ask him if
he can make as much of his stakes."</Q> Then rubbing his hands, and
shrug∣ging up his shoulders, 
<Q REND="inline">"Why now, says he, to-morrow night I may eat
as much cold beef as I can stuff in any tavern in <HI>London,</HI> and pay
nothing for it"</Q> A dish of tarts, cheese∣cakes and custards next made
their appearance at the request of the young ladies, who paid no sort of
regard to the fa∣ther's remonstrance, 
<Q REND="inline">"that they were four times as dear as at the
pastry-cook's."</Q></P>
<P>SUPPER being ended, madam put her spouse in mind to call for
wine.— 
<Q REND="inline">"We <HI>must</HI> have some wine, my dear,
or we shall not be looked upon, you know."</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">"Well, well, says the don, that's right
enough. But do they sell their liquor too by the ounce?—</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">"Here, drawer, what wine have you got?"</Q> The
fellow, who by this time began to smoke his guests, answered— 
<Q REND="inline">"We have exceeding good <HI>French</HI> wine of
all sorts, and please your honour. Would your honour have a bottle of
Champagne, or Burgundy, or Claret, or"—</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">"No, no, none of your wishy-washy
outlandish rot-gut for me:"</Q> interrupted the citizen.— 
<Q REND="inline">"A tankard of the Alderman beats all the red
Claret wine in the <HI>French</HI> king's cellar.—But come, bring us a
bottle of sound old Port; and d'ye hear? let it be good."</Q></P>
<P>WHILE the waiter was gone, the good man most sadly
la∣mented, that he could not have his pipe; which the wife would by no means
allow, 
<Q REND="inline">"because (she said) it was ungenteel to
smoke, where there were any ladies in company."</Q> When the wine came, our
citizen gravely took up the bottle, and holding it above his head, 
<Q REND="inline">"Aye, aye, said he, the bottom has had a good
kick—And mind how confoundedly it is warped on the sides.—Not
above five gills, I warrant.—An old soldier at the <HI>Jerusalem</HI>
would beat two of them.—But let us see how it is brew'd."</Q> He then
poured out a glass; and after holding it up before the candle, smelling to 
<PB N="407" REF="414"/> it, sipping it twice or thrice, and smacking with
his lips; drank it off: but declaring that second thoughts were best, he
filled another bumper; and tossing that off, after some pause, with a
very important air, ventured to pronounce it drinkable. The ladies, having
also drank a glass round, af∣firmed it was very good, and felt warm in the
stomach: and even the old gentleman relaxed into such good humour by the
time the bottle was emptied, that out of his own free will and motion he most
generously called for another pint, but charged the waiter 
<Q REND="inline">"to pick out an honest one."</Q></P>
<P>WHILE the glass was thus circulating, the family amused
themselves by making observations on the Garden. The ci∣tizen expressed
his wonder at the number of lamps; and said it must cost a great deal of
money every night to light them all: the eldest miss declared, that for her
part she liked the Dark Walk best of all, because it was
<HI>solentary:</HI> little miss thought the last song mighty pretty,
and said she would buy it, if she could but remember the tune: and the
old lady ob∣served, that there was a great deal of good company indeed; but
the gentlemen were so rude, that they perfectly put her out of countenance by
staring at her through their spy-glasses. In a word, the tarts, the
cheesecakes, the beef, the chicken, the ounce of ham, and every thing,
seemed to have been quite forgot, till the dismal moment approached, that
the reckoning was called for. As this solemn business concerns only the
gentlemen, the ladies kept a profound silence; and when the terrible account
was brought, they left the pay∣master undisturbed to enjoy the misery by
himself: only the old lady had the hardiness to squint at the sum
total, and de∣clared 
<Q REND="inline">"it was pretty reasonable
<HI>considering.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>OUR citizen bore his misfortunes with a tolerable degree of
patience: he shook his head as he run over every article, and swore he
would never buy meat by the ounce again. At length, when he had carefully
summed up every figure, he bade the drawer bring change for six-pence: then
pulling out a leathern purse from a snug pocket in the inside of his
waistcoat, he drew out slowly, piece by piece, thirteen shil∣lings; which
he regularly placed in two rows upon the ta∣ble. When the change was brought,
after counting it very carefully, he laid down four half-pence in the same
exact or∣der; then calling the waiter,— 
<Q REND="inline">"there, says he, there's your
damage—thirteen and two-pence—And hearkye, there's three-pence over
for yourself."</Q> The remaining penny he <PB N="408" REF="415"/> put into his
coat-pocket; and chinking it— 
<Q REND="inline">"this, says he, will serve me to-morrow to
buy a paper of tobacco."</Q></P>
<P>THE family now prepared themselves for going; and as there
were some slight drops of rain, madam buttoned up the old gentleman's coat,
that he might not spoil his laced waist∣coat, and made him flap his hat,
over which she tyed his pocket handkerchief, to save his wig: and as the
coat itself, (she said) had never been worn but three Sundays, she even
parted with her own Cardinal, and spread it the wrong side out over his
shoulders. In these accoutrements he sallied forth, accompanied by his
wife with her upper petticoat thrown over her head, and his daughters with the
skirts of their gowns turned up, and their heads muffled up in co∣loured
handkerchiefs. I followed them quite out of the Gar∣den; and as they were
waiting for their hack to draw up, the youngest miss asked, 
<Q REND="inline">"When shall we come again, papa?—</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">"Come again? (said he) what a pox would you
ruin me? Once in one's life is enough; and I think I have done very handsome.
Why it would not have cost me above four-pence half-penny to have spent my
evening at <HI>Sots Hole:</HI> and what with the cursed coach hire, and all
together, here's almost a pound gone, and nothing to show for it."</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">"Fye, Mr. <HI>Rose,</HI> I am quite ashamed
for you,"</Q> replies the old lady. 
<Q REND="inline">"You are always grudging me and your girls the
least bit of pleasure: and you cannot help grumbling, if we do but go to
<HI>Little Hornsey</HI> to drink tea. I am sure, now they are women grown
up, they ought to see a little of the world;—and they SHALL."</Q> The
old don was not willing to pursue the argument any further; and the coach
coming up, he was glad to put an end to the dispute by say∣ing,— 
<Q REND="inline">"Come, come, let us make haste, wife; or we
shall not get home time enough to have my best wig combed out
again;—and to-morrow, you know, is Sunday."</Q></P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>N a visit which I paid the other day to a lady of great
sense and taste, I was agreeably surprised by having two little
volumes put into my hands, which have been lately pub∣lished under the title
of "POEMS by <HI>EMINENT LADIES.</HI>" These volumes are, indeed, (as the
author of the preface has remarked) 
<Q REND="inline">"the most solid compliment, that can
possibly be paid to the fair sex."</Q> I never imagined, that our nation
could boast so many excellent Poetesses, (whose works are an honour
to their country) as I found are here collected together: And it is with the
highest satisfaction I can assure my female readers in particular, that
I have found a great number of very ele∣gant pieces among the writings of
these ladies, which cannot be surpassed by the most celebrated of our
male-writers.</P>
<P><PB N="410" REF="417"/>THE pleasure, which I received from
reading these poems, made such an impression on my mind, that at night,
as soon as I fell asleep, my fancy presented to me the fol∣lowing Dream.
I was transported, I know not how, to the regions of <HI>Parnassus</HI>;
and found myself in the Court of <HI>Apollo,</HI> surrounded by a great
number of our most eminent poets. A cause of the utmost importance was
then depend∣ing; and the debate was, whether the ladies, who had
dis∣tinguished themselves in poetry, should be allowed to hold the
same rank, and have the same honours paid them, with the men. As the
moderns were not allowed to plead in their own suit, <HI>Juvenal</HI> was
retained on the side of the male poets, and <HI>Sappho</HI> pleaded in
defence of the other sex. The <HI>Roman</HI> satirist in his speech at
the bar inveighed bitterly against women in general, and particularly
exclaimed against their dabbling in literature: but when <HI>Sappho</HI> came
to set forth the pretensions, which the ladies justly had to poetry, and
especially in love affairs, <HI>Apollo</HI> could no longer resist the
importunity of the <HI>Muses</HI> in favour of their own sex. He therefore
decreed, that all those females, who thought themselves able to manage
<HI>Pegasus,</HI> should immediately shew their skill and dexterity in
riding him.</P>
<P>PEGASUS was accordingly brought out of the stable, and the
<HI>Muses</HI> furnished him with a side-saddle. All the ladies, who
had courage enough to venture on his back, were pre∣pared to mount: but as a
great dispute arose among some of the competitors about precedency, (each
of them claim∣ing a right to ride first,) it was at length agreed, that they
should get into the saddle according to seniority.</P>
<P>UPON this a lady advanced; who, though she had some∣thing
rather extravagant in her air and deportment, yet she <PB N="411" REF="418"/>
had a noble presence, that commanded at once our awe and admiration. She was
dressed in an old-fashioned habit, very fantastic, and trimmed with
bugles and points; such as was worn in the times of King <HI>Charles</HI> the
first. This lady, I was informed, was the Dutchess of NEWCASTLE. When she
came to mount, she sprung into the saddle with sur∣prising agility;
and giving an entire loose to the reins, <HI>Pe∣gasus</HI> directly set
up a gallop, and run away with her quite out of our sight. However, it was
acknowledged, that she kept a firm seat, even when the horse went at his
deep∣est rate; and that she wanted nothing but to ride with a curb-bridle.
When she came to dismount, <HI>Shakespeare</HI> and <HI>Milton</HI> very
kindly offered their hand to help her down, which she accepted. Then
<HI>Euterpe</HI> came up to her with a smile, and begged her to repeat
those beautiful lines against Melancholy, which (she said) were so
extremely pictu∣resque. The Dutchess, with a most pleasing air,
imme∣diately began— 
<Q> 
<L><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See <HI>Poems by Eminent
Ladies.</HI> Vol. II. Page 200.</NOTE>Dull Melancholy—</L> 
<L>She'll make you start at ev'ry noise you hear,</L> 
<L>And visions strange shall to your eyes appear.</L> 
<L>Her voice is low, and gives an hollow sound;</L> 
<L>She hates the light, and is in darkness found;</L> 
<L>Or sits by blinking lamps, or tapers small,</L> 
<L>Which various shadows make against the wall:</L> 
<L>She loves nought else, but noise which discord
makes;</L> 
<L>As croaking frogs, whose dwelling is in lakes;</L> 
<L>The raven hoarse, the mandrake's hollow groan,</L> 
<L>And shrieking owls, that fly i'th 'night alone;</L> 
<L><PB N="412" REF="419"/>The tolling bell, which for the dead
rings out;</L> 
<L>A mill, where rushing waters run about.</L> 
<L>She loves to walk in the still moon-shine night,</L> 
<L>And in a thick dark grove she takes delight:</L> 
<L>In hollow caves, thatch'd houses, and low cells,</L> 
<L>She loves to live, and there alone she dwells.</L> 
<L>There leave her to herself alone to dwell,</L> 
<L>While you and I in mirth and pleasure swell.</L></Q> All
the while that these lines were repeating, <HI>Milton</HI> seem∣ed very
much chagrined; and it was whispered by some, that he was obliged for many
of the thoughts in his <HI>L'Allegro</HI> and <HI>Il Penseroso</HI> to this
lady's 
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Vol. II. page 199. N. B. This lady
wrote before <HI>Milton.</HI></NOTE><HI>Dialogue between Mirth and
Melancholy.</HI></P>
<P>THE Celebrated ORINDA, Mrs. KATHERINE PHILIPS, was next placed
in the saddle, amid the shouts and applauses of the lords
<HI>Roscommon</HI> and <HI>Orrery, Cowley,</HI> and other fa∣mous wits of her
time. Her dress was simple, though of a very elegant make: it had no
profuse ornaments, and approached very nearly to the cut and fashion of the
present age. Though she never ventured beyond a canter or an hand-gallop,
she made <HI>Pegasus</HI> do his paces with so much ease and
exactness, that <HI>Waller</HI> owned he could never bring him under so
much command. After her Mrs. KILLI∣GREW, assisted by <HI>Dryden,</HI> and
several other ladies of that age took their turns to ride: and every one
agreed, that (making some allowances for their sex) they could not be
excelled by the most experienced riders among the men.</P>
<P><PB N="413" REF="420"/>A BOLD masculine figure now pushed
forward in a thin, airy, gay habit, which hung so loose about her, that
she ap∣peared to be half undrest. When she came up to <HI>Pegasus,</HI>
she clapped her hand upon the side-saddle, and with a spring leaped
across it, saying that she would never ride him but astride. She made
the poor beast frisk, and caper, and curvet, and play a thousand tricks;
while she herself was quite unconcerned, though she shewed her legs at
every motion of the horse, and many of the <HI>Muses</HI> turned their
heads aside blushing. <HI>Thalia,</HI> indeed, was a good deal pleased
with her frolicks; and <HI>Erato</HI> declared, that next to her favourite
<HI>Sappho</HI> she should always prefer this lady. Upon enquiring her name
I found her to be the free-spirited Mrs. BEHN. When she was to dismount,
Lord <HI>Rochester</HI> came up, and caught her in his arms; and repeating
part of her

<BIBL>MILTON.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>I HAD now the pleasure to see many ladies of our own times,
whose names I was very well acquainted with, ad∣vance towards
<HI>Pegasus.</HI> Among the rest I could not but wonder at the
astonishing dexterity, with which the admired Mrs LEAPOR of
<HI>Brackley</HI> guided the horse, though she had not the least
direction or assistance from any body. Mrs. BARBER of <HI>Ireland</HI>
was assisted in getting upon the saddle by <HI>Swift</HI> himself,
who even condescended to hold the stirrup while she mounted. Under the
Dean's direction she made the horse to pace and amble very prettily:
notwithstanding <PB N="414" REF="421"/> which some declared, that she was
not equal to her friend and country-woman Mrs. GRIERSON.</P>
<P>ANOTHER lady, a native of the same kingdom, then briskly
stepped up to <HI>Pegasus</HI>; and despising the weak efforts of her
husband to prevent her, she boldly jumped into the saddle, and whipping
and cutting rode away furiously helter skelter over hedge and ditch, and
trampled on every body who came in her road. She took particular delight in
driving the poor horse, who kicked and winced all the while, into the most
filthy places; where she made him fling about the dirt and mire, with which
she bespattered almost every one that came near her. Sometimes, however,
she would put a stop to this mad career; and then she plainly convinced
us, that she knew as well how to manage <HI>Pegasus</HI> as any of the
females, who had tried before her. Being told that this lady was no other than
the celebrated biographer of her own actions Mrs. PILKINGTON, I had the
curiosity to take a nearer view of her; when stepping up towards her, and
offering my assistance to help her down, methought she returned my
civility with such an uncourteous slap on the face, that (though I awaked
at the instant) I could not help fancying for some time, that I felt my
cheek tingle with the blow.</P>

<P>THE contents of the postscript I naturally referred to the
consideration of my publisher, who consequently had a right to determine
on the goodness of my friend's essay: but, whatever was the reason, I
heard no more of it. The com∣merce between bookseller and author is, indeed,
of very great service, especially to the latter: for though I myself
must undoubtedly be excepted out of the number, yet it must be
confessed, that the most famous wits have owed their support to this
pecuniary intercourse. Meat and drink, and the other conveniences of life,
are as necessary to an author, as pen, ink and paper: and I remember to

<P>I HAVE been happy all this winter in having the run of a
nobleman's table, who was pleased to patronize a work of mine, and to which
he allowed me the honour of pre∣fixing his name in a dedication. We
geniusses have a spirit, you know, far beyond our pockets: and (besides
the extra∣ordinary expence of new cloaths to appear decent) I assure you I
have laid out every farthing, that I ever received from his lordship, in tips
to his servants. After every dinner I was forced to run the gauntlet through
a long line of powdered pick-pockets; and I could not but look upon it as a
very ridiculous circumstance, that I should be obliged to give money to a
fellow, who was dressed much finer than my∣self. In such a case, I am
apt to consider the showy waist∣coat of a foppish footman or butler out
of livery, as laced down with the shillings and half-crowns of the guests.
I would therefore beg of you, Mr. TOWN, to recommend the poor author's case
to the consideration of the gentlemen of the cloth; humbly praying, that they
would be pleased to let us go scot-free as well as the clergy: for though a
good meal is in truth a very comfortable thing to us, it is enough to blunt the

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE taken the pains as usual to read your paper, and as
you receive letters, I thought proper among the rest to send one also, to
let you know that I did not know that a cat was capable of constituting a
religious society before. A priest may, tis true; and so may another
rational creature, and perhaps an old woman also. But, sir, you argue, that
what a <HI>French</HI> fool or lunatic says on this head, is true; but you
make more out, I observe, from the old woman and the leathern apron, than you
do of the cat. For, if old women will, or does constitute a religious
society, I under∣stand from the foundation you seem to argue, that you
are as much an old woman as they. For to argue or reason from an old woman's
story, and for all your learning, and policy, and cunningness, and judgment
you seem to have, you have but little of yourself: and as you seem to
ridicule religion, and compare it to atheism or lunacy, I would beg the
favour to know, sir, what religion You are of: but by your talk I fear you
are of none at all. This New Doctrine, sir, that you revile, is the real
gospel, which you will find so, if you hear it, and compare it with the
scriptures, if you believe any scripture at all. For you say, sir, that
the most extraordinary tenets of religion are very successfully
propa∣gated under the sanction of leathern aprons instead of cassocks.
Well, and suppose it is: you acknowledge it is received by well
disposed people; and if it is, then it is plain, us you ridicule it, you
are not one of these well disposed. But, sir, this New Doctrine, as you
call it, is not only propagated <PB N="419" REF="426"/> under the sanction of
leathern aprons, by barbers, brick∣layers, and the like, but by many of the
clergy now in the established church: and if you often went to hear them,
but not as a critic to carp at what is there spoken, you would understand
more what this New Doctrine meant, and whe∣ther it drives men to
enthusiasm, and the like, or no. Sir, what you touch on the Moravians, I
will not say any thing about or against; for perhaps it is too true. But,
sir, I would advise you to know a little more of religion experimentally
for yourself, before you pretend to condemn others. And, sir, if you are
informed, that there will be a mad-house built on the ground where the
Foundery stands, or the Me∣thodists meeting-house, as you call it,
perhaps there may be as many criticising lunatics in it, as religious ones;
and very likely more. Sir, I beg you would take care, you don't bother your
brains too much about other peoples affairs; lest I should have the pain,
not the pleasure, of seeing you there. I have just given you a sketch
of the ridiculing the New Doctrine, and wish you could find some better
employ, if so be it was with a leathern apron before you; for I think it
would become you better than this point does. Sir, I hope you will excuse my
freedom with you, as others must yours with them.</P>

<HI>Ladies.</HI> You might at the same time have taken notice 
<PB N="420" REF="427"/> of the wonderful increase among the other sex in the
order of GENTLEMEN. Besides those, who are universally acknow∣ledged of
this rank from their birth and situation in life, the courtesy of
<HI>England</HI> also entitles all persons who carry arms to that dignity:
so that his Majesty's three regiments of guards are composed entirely of
Gentlemen; and every prig∣gish fellow, who can clap a queüe to his
peruke, and hang a sword aukwardly dangling by his side, from thence
assumes the importance as well as name of a Gentleman. Idleness and
ignorance being too often the disgrace of those, who are Gentlemen born and
bred, many invest themselves with that dignity, though with no other
qualifications. If the pride, poverty, or neglect of parents, has prevented
their son from being bound 'prentice, or if the idle rascal has shewn his
indentures a light pair of heels, in either case <HI>Tom</HI> is of no trade,
and consequently a Gentleman. I know at this time a man, who came from
<HI>Ireland</HI> last summer with a hayfork, but before winter raised
himself to the rank of a Gentleman: and every day I go to
<HI>Windmill-street,</HI> I see a very honour∣able Gentleman betting large
sums of money, whom I for∣merly remember Marker of the Tennis Court. Add to
this, that all attorneys clerks, prentices, and the like, are Gen∣tlemen every
evening; and the citizen, who drudges all the rest of the week behind the
counter, every sunday, together with his laced waistcoat and ruffles, puts
on the Gentleman. Every author, Mr. TOWN, is a Gentleman, if not an Esquire,
by his profession; and all the players, from King <HI>Richard</HI> to the
<HI>Lieutenant of the Tower,</HI> are Gentlemen. The body of Gentlemen is
still more numerous; but I have not leisure at present to climb up to
garrets, or dive into cellars after them: I shall only observe, that many
of the above-mentioned members of this order die with the same reputation
that they lived, and go out of the world like 'Squire <HI>Maclean,</HI> or
Gentleman <HI>Harry.</HI></P>
