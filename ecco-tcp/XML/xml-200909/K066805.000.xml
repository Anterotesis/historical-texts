<ARGUMENT>
<HEAD>THE ARGUMENT OF THE ODE</HEAD>
<P><HI>SAUL,</HI> for his Disobedience to Heaven, is afflicted
with the Fiend of <HI>MELANCHOLY, p. 5. DAVID</HI> is sent for, to cure him
by the Power of Music, <HI>p. 6.</HI> He comes, attended with a Choir of
Shepherds; and, as the means of dispelling <HI>SAUL's</HI> Despair, he
sings the Creation of the World, and the happy Estate of our first
Parents in Paradise, <HI>ib. to 9. SAUL</HI> is moved by the
Representation; but expostulates with DAVID, "why, when others are happy,
He should be miserable" <HI>p. 10. DAVID,</HI> to convince him that Guilt
is the Source of Misery, sings the Fall of Man, and his Expulsion from
Paradise, <HI>ib.</HI> This alarms the Monarch's Pride; and instead of
reclaiming, provokes him to Resentment and Rage, <HI>p. 11. DAVID,</HI>
superior to his Threats, awakens his Conscience, and terrifies him, by
singing the Fate and Punishment of Guilt, in the Destruction of the
rebellious Tribe of <HI>CHORAH</HI> by an Earthquake, and of the guilty World
by the general <PB N="iv" REF="4"/> Deluge, <HI>p. 11, 12, 13. SAUL,</HI>
struck with Horror, attempts to kill himself, <HI>p. 14.</HI> But being
prevented by his Friends, <HI>DAVID</HI> sooths his Anguish, by invoking
Repentance and divine Mercy to compose his Passions, <HI>p. 14. SAUL</HI>
relents into virtuous Sorrow, <HI>p. 15.</HI> But his Despair returning,
<HI>DAVID</HI> calls on his at∣tendant Choir to raise a more sublime and
affecting Strain, <HI>p. 16.</HI> This hath its Effect; and <HI>SAUL</HI> melts
into Tears of Penitence, <HI>ib. DAVID</HI> now comforts him with the Return of
the divine Favour, <HI>p. 17.</HI> To banish the Remains of Pride, he then
sings his own Happiness in the humble Station of a Shepherd, <HI>ib.</HI>
Still farther to compose the Monarch's Griefs, by a Strain of soft Music
he throws him into a gentle Slumber; invoking celestial visions to
transport him to the Regions of the Blessed, and change his Anguish
into Joy, <HI>p. 18.</HI> The desired Effects appear in his Countenance: The
Fiend departs: And <HI>SAUL</HI> awakes in perfect Tranquillity, <HI>p. 18.
DAVID</HI> then con∣cludes with a Song of Triumph on the Powers of Harmony, and
the seraphic Hymn that attended her, as the Minister of Heaven, on the
Creation of the World, <HI>p. 19.</HI></P>

<LG>
<L>"VENGEANCE, arise from thy infernal Bed;</L>
<L>"And pour thy Tempest oh his Guilty Head!"</L>
<L>Thus Heav'n's Decree, in Thunder's Sound,</L>
<L>Shook the dark Abyss profound.—</L>
<L>The unchain'd Furies come!</L>
<L>Pale <HI>Melancholy</HI> stalks from Hell:</L>
<L>Th' abortive Offspring of her Womb,</L>
<L><HI>Despair</HI> and <HI>Anguish</HI> round her yell.</L>
<L>By sleepless Terror SAUL possess'd,</L>
<L>Deep feels the Fiend within his tortur'd Breast.</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="6"/>Midnight Spectres round him howl:</L>
<L>Before his Eyes.</L>
<L>In Troops they rise;</L>
<L>And Seas of Horror overwhelm his Soul.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Haste; to JESSE's <HI>Son</HI> repair:</L>
<L>He best can sweep the Lyre,</L>
<L>Wake the solemn sounding Air,</L>
<L>And lead the vocal Choir:</L>
<L>On ev'ry String soft-breathing Raptures dwell,</L>
<L>To sooth the Throbbings of the troubled Breast;</L>
<L>Whose magic Voice can bid the Tides of Passion
swell,</L>
<L>Or lull the raging Storm to Rest.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Sunk on his Couch, and loathing Day,</L>
<L>The heav'n-forsaken <HI>Monarch</HI> lay:</L>
<L>To the sad Couch the <HI>Shepherd</HI> now drew near;</L>
<L>And, while th' obedient <HI>Choir</HI> stood round,</L>
<L>Prepar'd to catch the Soul-commanding Sounds,</L>
<L>He drop'd a gen'rous Tear.—</L>
<L>Thy pitying Aid, O GOD, impart!</L>
<L>For lo, thy poison'd Arrows drink his Heart!</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="7"/>The mighty Song from <HI>Chaos</HI>
rose.—</L>
<L>Around his Throne the formless Atoms sleep.</L>
<L>And drowzy Darkness broods upon the Deep:—</L>
<L><HI>Confusion,</HI> wake!</L>
<L>Bid the Realms of <HI>Chaos</HI> shake!</L>
<L>Rouse him from his dread Repose!—</L>
<L>Hark! loud <HI>Discord</HI> breaks her Chain:</L>
<L>The hostile Atoms clash with deafning Roar:</L>
<L>Her hoarse Voice thunders through the drear Domain;</L>
<L>And kindles ev'ry Element to War.—</L>
<L>"Tumult cease!</L>
<L>"Sink to Peace!</L>
<L>"Let there be Light!"—Th' <HI>Almighty</HI> said:</L>
<L>And lo, the radiant <HI>Sun,</HI></L>
<L>Flaming from his orient Bed,</L>
<L>His endless Course begun.</L>
<L>See, the twinkling <HI>Pleiads</HI> rise:</L>
<L>Thy Star, <HI>Orion,</HI> reddens in the Skies:</L>
<L>While slow around the northern Plain,</L>
<L><HI>Arcturus</HI> wheels his nightly Wane.</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="8"/>Thy Glories, too, refulgent <HI>Moon,</HI> he
sung;</L>
<L>Thy mystic Mazes, and thy changeful Ray:</L>
<L>O fairest of the starry Throng!</L>
<L>Thy solemn Orb of Light</L>
<L>Guides the triumphant Carr of Night</L>
<L>O'er Silver Clouds, and sheds a softer Day!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ye <HI>Planets,</HI> and each circling
<HI>Constellation,</HI></L>
<L>In Songs harmonious tell your Generation!</L>
<L>Oh, while yon radiant <HI>Seraph</HI> turns the Spheres,</L>
<L>And on the stedfast Pole-Star stands sublime;</L>
<L>Wheel your Rounds</L>
<L>To heav'nly Sounds;</L>
<L>And sooth his Song-inchanted Ears,</L>
<L>With your celestial Chime.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In dumb Surprize the list'ning Monarch lay;</L>
<L>(His Woe suspended by sweet Music's Sway)</L>
<L>And awe-struck, with uplifted Eye</L>
<L>Mus'd on the new-born Wonders of the Sky.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Lead the soothing Verse along:</L>
<L>He feels, he feels the Pow'r of Song.—</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="9" MS="y"/>Ocean hastens to his Bed:</L>
<L>The lab'ring Mountain rears his rock-encumber'd Head:</L>
<L>Down his steep and shaggy Side</L>
<L>The torrent rolls his thund'ring Tide;</L>
<L>Then smooth and clear, along the fertile Plain</L>
<L>Winds his majestic Waters to the distant Main.</L>
<L>Flocks and Herds the Hills adorn:</L>
<L>The Lark, high-foaring, hails the Morn.</L>
<L>And while along yon crimson-clouded Steep</L>
<L>The slow Sun steals into the golden Deep,</L>
<L>Hark! the solemn Nightingale</L>
<L>Warbles to the woodland Dale.</L>
<L>See, descending Angels show'r</L>
<L>Heav'n's own Bliss on <HI>Eden's</HI> Bow'r:</L>
<L>Peace on Nature's Lap reposec;</L>
<L>Pleasure strews her guiltless Roses:</L>
<L>Joys divine in Circles move,</L>
<L>Link'd with Innocence and Love.</L>
<L>Hail, happy Love, with Innocence combin'd!</L>
<L>All hail, ye sinless Parents of Mankind!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>They paus'd:—the Monarch, prostrate on his Bed,</L>
<L>Submissive bow'd his Head;</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="10"/>Ador'd the Works of boundless Pow'r
divine:</L>
<L>Then, Anguish-struck, he cry'd (and smote his
Breast)</L>
<L>Why, why is Peace the welcome Guest</L>
<L>Of ev'ry Heart but Mine!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now let the solemn lumbers flow.</L>
<L>Till he feel that Guilt is Woe.</L>
<L>Heav'nly Harp, in mournful Strain</L>
<L>O'er yon weeping Bow'r complain:</L>
<L>What Sounds of bitter Pangs I hear!</L>
<L>What Lamentations wound mine Ear!</L>
<L>In vain, devoted Pair, these Tears ye shed:</L>
<L>Peace with Innocence is fled.</L>
<L>The Messengers of Grace depart:</L>
<L>Death glares, and shakes the dreadful Dart!</L>
<L>Ah, whither fly ye, by yourselves abhor'd,</L>
<L>To shun that frowning Cherub's firey Sword?—</L>
<L>Lo!</L>
<L>Hapless, hapless Pair,</L>
<L>Goaded by Despair,</L>
<L>Forlorn, thro' desert Climes they go!</L>
<L>Wake, my Lyre! can Pity sleep,</L>
<L>When Heav'n is mov'd, and Angels weep!</L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="11"/>Flow, ye melting Numbers, flow;</L>
<L>Till he feel, that Guilt is Woe.—</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The King, with Pride, and Shame, and Anguish, torn,</L>
<L>Shot Fury from his Eyes, and Scorns.</L>
<L>The glowing Youth,</L>
<L>Bold in Truth,</L>
<L>(So still should Virtue guilty Pow'r engage)</L>
<L>With Brow undaunted met his Rage.</L>
<L>See, his Cheek kindles into generous Fire:</L>
<L>Stern, he bends him o'er his Lyre;</L>
<L>And, while the Doom of Guilt he sings,</L>
<L>Shakes Horror from the tortur'd Strings,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>What Sounds of Terror and Distress</L>
<L>Rend yon howling Wilderness!</L>
<L>The dreadful Thunders found;</L>
<L>The forked Lightnings flash along the Ground.</L>
<L>Why yawns that deep'ning Gulph below?—</L>
<L>'Tis for Heav'n's rebellious Foe:—</L>
<L>Fly, ye Sons of ISRAEL, fly,</L>
<L>Who dwells in <HI>Korah's</HI> guilty Tents must
die!—.</L>
<L>They sink!—Have Mercy, Lord!—Their Cries</L>
<L>In dreadful Tumult rise!</L>
<L><PB N="12" REF="12"/>Hark, from the Deep their loud Laments I
hear!</L>
<L>They lessen now, and lessen on the Ear!</L>
<L>Now, Destruction's Strife is o'er!</L>
<L>The countless Host</L>
<L>For ever lost!</L>
<L>The Gulph is clos'd!—Their Cries are heard no
more!—</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But Oh, my Lyre, what Accents can relate</L>
<L>Sinful Man's appointed Fate!</L>
<L>He comes, he comes! th' avenging GOD!</L>
<L>Clouds and Darkness round him rowl:</L>
<L>Tremble, Earth! Ye Mountains, nod!</L>
<L>He bows the Skies, and shakes the Pole.</L>
<L>The gloomy Banners of his Wrath unfurl'd,</L>
<L>He calls the Floods, to drown a guilty World:</L>
<L>"<HI>Ruin,</HI> lift thy baleful Head:</L>
<L>"Rouze the guilty World from Sleep;</L>
<L>"Lead up thy Billows from their cavern'd Bed,</L>
<L>"And burst the Rocks that chain thee in the Deep."—</L>
<L>Now, th'impetuous Torrents rise;</L>
<L>The hoarse-ascending Deluge roars:</L>
<L>Down rush the Cataracts from the Skies;</L>
<L>The swelling Waves o'erwhelm the Shores.</L>
<L><PB N="13" REF="13"/>Just, O God, is thy Decree!</L>
<L>Shall guilty Man contend with Thee!</L>
<L>Lo, <HI>Hate</HI> and <HI>Envy,</HI> sea-intomb'd,</L>
<L>And <HI>Rage</HI> with <HI>Lust</HI> in Ruin sleep;</L>
<L>And scoffing <HI>Luxury</HI> is doom'd</L>
<L>To glut the vast and rav'nous Deep!—</L>
<L>In vain from <HI>Fate</HI> th' astonish'd Remnant
flies:—</L>
<L>"Shrink, ye Rocks! Ye Oceans, rise!"—</L>
<L>The tottering Cliffs no more the Floods controul;</L>
<L>Sea following Sea ingulphs the Ball:</L>
<L>O'er the sunk Hills the watry Mountains rowl,</L>
<L>And wide <HI>Destruction</HI> swallows all!—</L>
<L>Now fiercer let th' impassion'd Numbers glow:</L>
<L>Swell the Song, ye mighty Choir!</L>
<L>Wing your dreadful Darts with Fire!</L>
<L>Hear me, Monarch!—Guilt is Woe!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus while the frowning <HI>Shepherd</HI> pour'd along</L>
<L>The deep impetuous Torrent of his Song;</L>
<L>SAUL, stung by dire Despair,</L>
<L>Gnash'd his Teeth, and tore his Hair:</L>
<L>From his Blood, by Horror chill'd,</L>
<L>A cold and agonizing Sweat distill'd:</L>
<L><PB N="14" REF="14"/>Then, foaming with unutterable Smart,</L>
<L>He aim'd a Dagger at his Heart.</L>
<L>His watchful Train prevent the Blow;</L>
<L>And call each lenient Balm, to heal his frantic Woe:</L>
<L>But pleas'd, the <HI>Shepherd</HI> now beheld</L>
<L>His Pride by Heav'n's own Terrors quell'd:</L>
<L>Then bade his potent Lyre controul</L>
<L>The mighty Storm that rent his Soul.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Cease your Cares: the Body's Pain</L>
<L>A sweet Relief may find:</L>
<L>But Gums and lenient Balms are vain,</L>
<L>To heal the wounded Mind.</L>
<L>Come, fair <HI>Repentance,</HI> from the Skies,</L>
<L>O sainted Maid, with upcast Eyes!</L>
<L>Descend in thy celestial Shrowd,</L>
<L>Vested in a weeping Cloud!</L>
<L>Holy Guide, descend, and bring</L>
<L><HI>Mercy</HI> from th' eternal King!</L>
<L>Calm his Soul, your Beams impart,</L>
<L>And pour your Comforts o'er his Heart!—</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>They come: O King, thine Ear incline:</L>
<L>Listen to their Voice divine:</L>
<L><PB N="15" REF="15"/>Their Voice shall every Pang
compose,</L>
<L>To gentle Sorrow melt thy Woes;</L>
<L>Till each pure Wish to Heav'n shall soar,</L>
<L>And Peace return, to part no more!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Behold, obedient to their great Command,</L>
<L>The lifted Dagger quits his trembling Hand:</L>
<L>Smooth'd is his Brow, where sullen Care</L>
<L>And furrow'd Horror couch'd with fell Despair:</L>
<L>No more his Eyes with Fury glow;</L>
<L>But heav'nly Grief succeeds to hell-born Woe.—</L>
<L>See, the Signs of Grace appear:</L>
<L>See the soft relenting Tear,</L>
<L>Trickling at sweet Mercy's Call!</L>
<L>Catch it, Angels, ere it fall!</L>
<L>And let the heart-sent Offering rise,</L>
<L>Heav'n's best-accepted Sacrifice!—</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet, yet again?—Ah see, the Pang returns!</L>
<L>Again with inward Fire his heaving Bosom burns!</L>
<L>Now, <HI>Shepherds,</HI> wake a mightier Strain;</L>
<L>Search the deep, heart rending Pain;</L>
<L>Till the large Floods of Sorrow roll,</L>
<L>And quench the Tortures of his Soul.</L>
<L><PB N="16" REF="16"/>Almighty LORD, accept his Pang
sincere!</L>
<L>Let heav'nly Hope dispell each dark Temptation!</L>
<L>And, while he pours the penitential Tear,</L>
<L>O visit him with thy Salvation!—</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Stoop from Heav'n, ye raptur'd Throng:</L>
<L>Sink, ye swelling Tides of Song!</L>
<L>For lo, dissolv'd by Music's melting Pow'r,</L>
<L>Celestial Sorrow rolls her plenteous Show'r.</L>
<L>O'er his wan Cheek the Colours rise;</L>
<L>And Beams of Comfort brighten in his Eyes.</L>
<L>Happy King, thy Woes are o'er!</L>
<L>Thy God shall wound thy Heart no more:</L>
<L>The pitying Father of Mankind</L>
<L>Meets the pure-returning Mind.</L>
<L>No more shall black Despair afflict his Soul.</L>
<L>Each gentler Sound, ye Shepherds, now combine:</L>
<L>Sweetly let the Numbers roll:</L>
<L>Sooth him into Hope divine.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now lowly let the rustic Measure glide,</L>
<L>To quell the dark Remains of self-consuming Pride;</L>
<L>Till Nature's home-sprung Blessings he confess,</L>
<L>And own that calm Content is Happiness.—</L>
<L><PB N="17" REF="17"/>Ye Woods and Lakes, ye Cliffs and

<L>Haunted Grots, and living Fountains!</L>
<L>Listen to your <HI>Shepherd's</HI> Lay,</L>
<L>Whose artless Carols close the Day.</L>

<HEAD>SECT. II. The proposed Method of Inquiry.</HEAD>
<P>WHATEVER is founded in such <HI>Passions</HI> and
<HI>Principles</HI> of Action, as are <HI>common</HI> to the whole
<HI>Race</HI> of <HI>Man,</HI> will be most effectually investigated, as to
its <HI>Origin</HI> and <HI>Progress,</HI> by viewing Man in his
<HI>savage</HI> or <HI>uncultivated</HI> State. Here, before Education and
Art have cast their Veil over the human Mind, its various Powers throw
themselves out, and all its Workings present them∣selves instantly, and
without Disguise.</P>
<P>It may be affirmed with Truth, that, for Want of begin∣ning our
Inquiries at this early and neglected Period, and by viewing Man under his
State of <HI>Civilization</HI> only, many curious and interesting Questions
have been left involved in Darkness, which might have been clearly unfolded
by a free and full Research into the Passions, Propensities, and
Qualities of <HI>savage</HI> Man.</P>
<P>This the Writer hopes to make appear in a more <HI>exten∣sive
Degree,</HI> and on Subjects of <HI>higher Importance,</HI> through the
Course of a future Work<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">The Work advertised at the
End of this Dissertation.</NOTE>; of which, some of the Principles here
delivered will make an incidental Part. In the mean Time, he intends to treat
the present Subject in the Way now proposed, by deducing his Argument from
the first great and original Fountain of <HI>savage Life</HI> and
<HI>Manners.</HI></P>

<HEAD>SECT. III. Of Music, Dance, and Poem, in the savage
State.</HEAD>
<P>BY examining savage Life, where untaught Nature rules, we find
that the <HI>agreeable Passions</HI> of Love, Pity, Hope, Joy, and
Exultation, no less than their <HI>Con∣traries</HI> of Hate, Revenge, Fear,
Sorrow, and Despair, op∣pressing the human Heart by their mighty Force,
are thrown out by the three Powers of <HI>Action, Voice,</HI> and
<HI>articulate Sounds.</HI> The <HI>Brute</HI> Creatures express their
Passions by the two first of These; some by <HI>Action,</HI> some
by <HI>Voice,</HI> and some by <HI>both</HI> united: Beyond these,
<HI>Man</HI> has the added Power of <HI>articulate Speech:</HI> The same
Force of <HI>Association</HI> and <HI>Fancy</HI> which gives him <HI>higher
Degrees</HI> and a <HI>wider Variety</HI> of <HI>Passion,</HI> gives rise
to this <HI>additional Power</HI> of expressing those Passions which
he feels.</P>
<P>Among the <HI>Savages</HI> who are in the <HI>lowest Scale</HI> of
the human Kind, these several Modes of expressing their Passions
are found altogether suited to their wretched State. Their
<HI>Gestures</HI> are <HI>uncouth</HI> and <HI>horrid:</HI> Their
<HI>Voice</HI> is thrown out in <HI>Howls</HI> and <HI>Roarings:</HI> Their
<HI>Language</HI> is like the <HI>Gabbling of Geese.</HI></P>
<P>But if we ascend a Step or two higher in the Scale of savage
Life, we shall find this <HI>Chaos</HI> of <HI>Gesture, Voice,</HI> and
<HI>Speech,</HI> rising into an agreeable <HI>Order</HI> and
<HI>Proportion.</HI> The natural Love of a <HI>measured Melody,</HI> which
Time and Ex∣perience produce, throws the <HI>Voice</HI> into <HI>Song,</HI> the
<HI>Gesture</HI> into <HI>Dance,</HI> the <HI>Speech</HI> into
<HI>Verse</HI> or <HI>Numbers.</HI> The Ad∣dition of musical
<HI>Instruments</HI> comes of Course: They are <PB N="28" REF="27"/> but
<HI>Imitations</HI> of the human Voice, or of other natural Sounds, produced
gradually by frequent Trial and Ex∣periment.</P>
<P>Such is the Generation and natural Alliance of these three
<HI>Sister-Graces, Music, Dance,</HI> and <HI>Poem,</HI> which we find
moving Hand in Hand among the savage Tribes of every Climate.</P>
<P>For the Truth of the Fact, we may appeal to most of the Travellers
who describe the Scenes of uncultivated Nature: All these agree in telling
us, that <HI>Melody, Dance,</HI> and <HI>Song,</HI> make up the ruling
Pastime, adorn the Feasts, com∣pose the Religion, fix the Manners,
strengthen the Policy, and even form the future Paradise, of savage Man.
That having few Wants, and consequently much Leisure, the barbarous Tribes
addict themselves to these assuring Arts with a wonderful Degree of
Passion, unless where their Manners are corrupted by an incidental
Commerce with the Off-scum of civilized Nations. By these attractive and
powerful Arts they celebrate their public Solemnities; by these they lament
their private and public Calamities, the Death of Friends, or the Loss of
Warriors: By these united, they express their Joy on their Marriages,
Har∣vests, Huntings, Victories; praise the great Actions of their Gods and
Heroes; excite each other to War and brave Exploits, or to suffer Death and
Torments with un∣shaken Constancy.</P>
<P>These are the Circumstances most <HI>common</HI> to the
savage Tribes: Besides these, there are many <HI>peculiar</HI> Modes,
which arise from their different Climates, Situations, Opi∣nions, Manners.
Among some Tribes the <HI>joyous</HI> Passions, <PB N="29" REF="28"/>
among some the <HI>gentle,</HI> among others the <HI>ferocious,</HI>
pre∣dominate and take Place. To give all the Varieties of these savage and
festal Solemnities, were an endless Labour. Let the following Account
suffice, as a general Image of the rest; which is singled out, not only
because it is the most circumstantial; but likewise for the particular
Relation which it will be found to bear to a following Part of this
Inquiry.</P>
<P>The IROQUOIS, HURONS, and some less considerable Tribes, are
free and independent Savages, who inhabit the northern Continent of AMERICA;
and extend their Set∣tlements from the Back of the <HI>British Colonies</HI>
to the Bor∣ders of the <HI>Great Lakes,</HI> along the Skirts of LOUISIANA, and
down the River OHIO, towards the MISSISIPI, and the Gulph of FLORIDA. Father
LAFITAU<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><BIBL><HI>Moeurs des Sauvages,</HI> tom. ii. p.
213, &amp;c. 12<SUP>mo</SUP>.</BIBL></NOTE> gives the following Description of their
festal Solemnities; which it is necessary to transcribe at large, in
order to give an adequate Idea of their Manners and Character.</P>
<Q> 
<P> "On the appointed Day, early in the Morning, they prepare the
Feast in the <HI>Council-Cabbin,</HI> and there they dispose all Things
for the Assembly.—In the mean∣time, a public Crier goes through the
Village, and gives Notice that the <HI>Kettle</HI> is hung on in such a
Cabbin: The common People, and even the Chiefs, bring with them their
<HI>little Kettle.</HI> It doth not appear, that there is any Distinction of
Ranks among them, except that the <HI>old Men</HI> occupy the foremost Matts.
The IRO∣QUOISE <HI>Women</HI> assist not, that I know of, at these Kind
of Feasts; nor are they invited. The <HI>Children,</HI> and 
<PB N="30" REF="29"/> <HI>young Men,</HI> who are not as yet chosen into the
Body of Warriors, mount upon the Scaffolds which are placed over the Matts, and
even upon the Roof of the Cabbin itself, and look down through the Hole at
which the Smoke goes out."</P> 
<P> "While the Assembly is forming, He who makes the Feast, or He
in whose Name it is made, <HI>sings alone.</HI>—The Design of this
is to entertain the Company, on such Things as have Relation to the Subject
on which they assemble. These <HI>Songs,</HI> for the most Part, are
fill∣ed with the <HI>Fables</HI> of <HI>ancient Times,</HI> the <HI>heroic
Deeds</HI> of their <HI>Nation</HI>; and are composed in an <HI>antiquated
Style</HI>; so old, that often they understand not what they say. The
Singer hath sometimes an Assistant, who relieves him when he is
fatigued: For they sing with all their Force."</P> 
<P> "The Speaker then opens the Scene, by asking in Form, if all who
are invited are come. He then names the Person who makes the Feast, he
declares the Occasion on which it is made, and enters into a particular
Detail of all that is in the Kettle. At every thing which he names, the whole
Choir replies by a repeated Shout of Approbation."</P> 
<P> "The Speaker then gives an Account of every thing, which it is of
Importance that the Public should know. For these <HI>Song-Feasts,</HI>
being made on all <HI>weighty Occa∣sions</HI> which regard the
<HI>Village</HI> or the <HI>Nation</HI>; this is the proper Time for public
Affairs, as that of renewing a <HI>Name,</HI> hearing <HI>Ambassadors,</HI>
or <HI>proclaiming War</HI> by <HI>Song.</HI>"</P> 
<P><PB N="31" REF="30"/> "When the Orator hath done speaking,
sometimes they begin to eat before they sing, that they may have the better
Spirits: Sometimes they sing before they eat: If the Feast is to continue
for the whole Day, the Kettle is in Part empty'd in the Morning, and in Part
reserved for the Evening; and in the Intervals they <HI>sing</HI> and
<HI>dance.</HI>"</P> 
<P> "The Master of the Feast touches nothing. He busies himself
only in seeing that the Company be served, or in serving them himself;
naming aloud the Pieces which he destines and presents to each. The best
Morsels are given, by Way of Preference, to those whom he chuseth to
distinguish."</P> 
<P> "After the Repast, the Master of the Feast begins the
<HI>Athonront,</HI> a <HI>Song and Dance</HI> peculiar to the <HI>Men.</HI>
They relieve each other, by beginning with those of <HI>most
Consideration,</HI> and passing gradually down to the
<HI>Young∣est.</HI> They have that Civility and Attention to each other, that
every one waits till another of superior Dig∣nity enters the Lists, and
takes the Lead."</P> 
<P> "The <HI>Ancients</HI> and Men of Dignity often do no more than
<HI>rise</HI> from their Seats; and content themselves, while they
<HI>sing,</HI> with making some <HI>Inflexions</HI> with their Head,
Shoulders, and Knees, in order to <HI>accompany</HI> and <HI>sustain</HI>
their <HI>Song.</HI> Others somewhat less grave, take a few Steps, and walk
along the Cabin around the Fires. Every one hath his particular <HI>Song</HI>;
that is, an <HI>Air,</HI> to which he <HI>adjusts</HI> a very few
<HI>Words,</HI> which he repeats as often as he pleaseth. I have observed,
that they even <HI>retrench</HI> <PB N="32" REF="31"/> or <HI>strike off</HI>
some <HI>Syllables</HI> from their Words, as if they were <HI>Verses,</HI>
or <HI>measured</HI> Words, but <HI>without Rhyme.</HI>"</P> 
<P> "He who means to dance, begins by rising from his Matt; and the
whole Company answers him by a gene∣ral Shout of Approbation: As he
passeth along before every Fire, they who sit on each Side <HI>beat</HI>
the <HI>Measure</HI> or <HI>Cadence</HI> of his <HI>Song</HI> by a
correspondent Motion of the Head; and by throwing out continual Shouts which
they redouble at certain Times, where the Measure de∣mands it, with so much
Truth, that they never err; and with such a Delicacy of Ear, as the
<HI>French,</HI> who are most practised in their Customs, cannot attain
to. When he passeth to a second Fire, They of the first take Breath:
They of the more distant Fires are likewise silent: But the <HI>Time</HI>
is always <HI>beat</HI> by those before whose Fire he sings and dances.
The Song concludes by a general <HI>Ehoue!</HI> of the whole Choir; which is a
second Shout of Approbation."</P> 
<P> "The <HI>young</HI> Men have their <HI>Songs</HI> of a more
<HI>lively,</HI> and their <HI>Dances</HI> of a more <HI>vigorous</HI> Cast;
such as are suit∣able to their Age. When the Dance is much animated, they
dance two or three together, each at his own Fire: Nor does this Mixture ever
occasion any Confusion."</P> 
<P> "Among these Dances, <HI>some</HI> are no more than a
<HI>simple</HI> and <HI>noble</HI> Manner of <HI>marching</HI> up to an
<HI>Enemy</HI>; and of <HI>facing Danger</HI> with <HI>Intrepidity</HI> and
<HI>Gaiety</HI> of Mind."</P> 
<P> "A second Sort of Dance, but still of the same Kind, is that
of the <HI>Pantomimes:</HI> Which consists in representing an Action in
the Manner in which it passed, or such as they conceive it to have been.
Many of those who have <PB N="33" REF="32"/> lived among the IROQUOIS, have
assured me, that after a Chief of War hath circumstantially recounted, at
his Return, all that had passed in the Expeditions he had undertaken, and
the Battles he had fought, they who are present at the Recital often rise
on the sudden to dance, and represent those Actions with great Vivacity,
as if they had been present: And all this, without any pre∣vious Concert or
Preparation."</P> 
<P> "In their <HI>Songs</HI> they <HI>praise</HI> not only their
<HI>Gods</HI> and <HI>Heroes,</HI> but they likewise praise
<HI>themselves:</HI> In this they are not sparing: and are even
<HI>prodigal</HI> in their <HI>Praise</HI> of <HI>others,</HI> whom they
think <HI>worthy</HI> of it. He who is thus applauded, answers by a shout
of Thanks, as soon as he hears himself named."</P> 
<P> "They are still quicker at <HI>rallying</HI> each other; and
suc∣ceed to a Wonder in This. He who dances, takes whomsoever he pleaseth
by the Hand, and brings him forth into the midst of the Assembly: to
which he yields without Resistance. Meanwhile the <HI>Dancer</HI>
con∣tinues to <HI>sing</HI>; and sometimes in his <HI>Song,</HI> and
some∣times in the <HI>Intervals,</HI> he throws his <HI>Sarcasms</HI> on
the Patient, who hears him without Reply.—At every <HI>Bon Mot,</HI> loud
<HI>Peals</HI> of <HI>Laughter</HI> arise along the <HI>Galleries,</HI> who
<HI>animate</HI> this <HI>Sport,</HI> and often oblige the Patient to cover his
Head in his Mantle."</P> 
<P> "They have another Kind of <HI>Dance,</HI> in which the whole
<HI>Choir</HI> dances: and this is common both to Men and Wo∣men. As this is
very different from the preceeding ones, they do not use it in their
<HI>Song-Feasts.</HI> Their Pretenders <PB N="34" REF="33"/> to Magic<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot"><HI>Charlatans,</HI>—a Word with which we have none
precisely correspon∣dent in our Language: It signifies here, one who is a
Pretender to <HI>Mede∣cine</HI> by the Arts of <HI>Magic.</HI></NOTE> often
ordain it as an <HI>Act</HI> of <HI>Religion,</HI> for the <HI>healing</HI> of
the <HI>Sick:</HI> it is also one of their Modes of <HI>Di∣vination.</HI> It
is likewise practised, at Times, as a mere Exercise of
<HI>Pleasure,</HI> at the Feasts and Solemnities of the Village. The Manner
is as follows. Notice is given early in the Morning through all the Cabins, for
the Performance of this Ceremony: Every Cabin de∣putes a certain Number, either
of Men or Women, who dress themselves in all their Finery, that they may go
and perform their Part. They all appear at the ap∣pointed Hour (which is
proclaimed by a public Crier) either in the Council-Cabin, or some other
Place destined for the Purpose. In the middle of the Place or Cabin they
build a little Scaffold; and on this they raise a small Seat for the
<HI>Singers</HI> who are to <HI>accompany</HI> and <HI>animate</HI> the
<HI>Dance.</HI> One holds in his Hand a <HI>Tambour</HI> or little
<HI>Drum,</HI> the other a <HI>Tortoise Shell.</HI> While these sing, and
accompany their Song with the Sound of their Instru∣ments (which is farther
Strengthened by the Spectators, who beat with little Sticks upon the
<HI>Kettles</HI> that are before them) they who dance, go round in a circular
Movement; but without taking Hands, as they do in Europe. Each Dancer makes
various Motions with his Feet and Hands, as he pleaseth: And though all the
Movements are different, according to the Whim and Caprice of their
Imagination, none of them ever lose the <HI>Time.</HI> They who are most
expert in varying their <PB N="35" REF="34"/> Postures, and throwing
themselves into Action, are reckoned to excel the rest. The Dance is
composed of several <HI>Returns:</HI> Each <HI>Return</HI> lasts till the
Dancers are out of Breath; and after a short Interval of <HI>Repose,</HI>
they begin <HI>another.</HI> Nothing can be more animated than these
Movements: To see them, one would say, they were a Troop of furious and
frantic People. What must fatigue them still more is, that not only by
their Move∣ment but likewise with their Voice, they follow the Sing∣ers and
their Instruments to the End of each <HI>Return</HI>; which is always
closed by a general and loud <HI>Oueh!</HI> which is a Shout of Approbation,
implying that the <HI>Re∣turn</HI> hath been well performed."</P> 
<P> "Athough I have not spoken particularly of any Na∣tions but
those of the IROQUOIS and HURONS, yet I may truly say, that I have
described, at the same Time, <HI>all</HI> the other barbarous Nations of
AMERICA, as to what is <HI>essential</HI> and <HI>principal.</HI> For
though there ap∣pears to be a great Difference between the <HI>Monarchic</HI>
and <HI>Oligarchic</HI> State, yet the Genius of their savage Po∣licy is
every where the same: We find the same Turn for public Affairs, the same
Method of conducting them, the same Use of secret and solemn
Assemblies, the same Character in their <HI>Feasts,</HI> their
<HI>Dances,</HI> and their <HI>Di∣versions.</HI>"</P> 
<P> "The <HI>Music</HI> and <HI>Dance</HI> of the <HI>Americans</HI>
have some∣thing in them extremely barbarous, which at first dis∣gusts;
and of which no Idea can be formed by those who have not seen and heard
them. We grow recon∣ciled to them by Degrees, and in the End partake of them
with Pleasure. As to the Savages themselves, they <PB N="36" REF="35"/> are
fond of these Feasts even to Distraction. They con∣tinue them whole Days
and Nights entire; and the Shouts of their <HI>Choir</HI> are so violent, as
to make the Vil∣lage tremble."</P> </Q>
<P>Thus far the learned Father LAFITAU: For whose Detail no Apology
needs be made to the curious Reader. But the more particular Reasons, why it
is here given at Length, will appear in the following Sections.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="4" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. IV. Of the natural Consequences of a supposed
Civilization.</HEAD>
<P>WHILE these free and warlike Savages continue in their present
<HI>unlettered</HI> State of Ignorance and Simplicity, no material Improvements
in their <HI>Song-Feasts</HI> can arise. But let us suppose that the
Use of <HI>Letters</HI> should come among them, and, as a Cause or
Consequence of <HI>Civilization,</HI> be cultivated with that Spirit which is
natural to a free and active People; and many notable Consequences would
appear. Let us consider the most probable and striking among these
natural Effects.</P>
<P N="1">1. Their Idea of <HI>Music,</HI> in its most
<HI>inlarged</HI> Sense, would comprehend the three Circumstances of
<HI>Melody, Dance,</HI> and <HI>Song.</HI> For these three, as we have
seen, being na∣turally conjoined, because naturally producing each other,
would not <HI>separately</HI> command the Attention of such a People at
their public Festivals. Therefore <HI>Instrumental Melody,</HI> without
<HI>Song,</HI> would be little attended to, and of <HI>no Esteem</HI>;
because it would want all those Attractions which must arise from the
correspondent <HI>Dance</HI> and <HI>Song.</HI></P>
<P N="2"><PB N="37" REF="36"/>2. In the early Periods of such a
Commonwealth, the <HI>Chiefs</HI> or <HI>Legislators</HI> would often be the
<HI>principal Musicians.</HI> The two Characters would commonly coalesce;
for we find, that, among the savage Tribes, the <HI>Chiefs</HI> are they who
most signalize themselves by <HI>Dance</HI> and <HI>Song</HI>; and that
their <HI>Songs</HI> rowl principally on the <HI>great Actions</HI> and
<HI>Events</HI> which concern their <HI>own Nation.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. Hence, their most ancient <HI>Gods</HI> would naturally
be styled <HI>Singers</HI> and <HI>Dancers.</HI> For the most ancient
<HI>Gods</HI> of civilized Pagan Countries, are generally their early
<HI>Legislators,</HI> who taught their People the first Arts of Life.
These deceased Legislators, therefore, when advanced to the Rank of Gods,
would naturally be delivered down to Posterity with the same Attributes and
Qualities by which they had distinguished themselves in Life: And it
ap∣pears, from the last Article, that these Qualities would naturally be
those of <HI>Dance</HI> and <HI>Song.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. Measured Periods, or in other Words, <HI>Rythm,
Num∣bers,</HI> and <HI>Verse,</HI> would naturally arise. For measured
Cadence, or <HI>Time,</HI> is an essential Part of Melody, into which the
human Ear naturally falls. And as the same Force of Ear would lead the Action
or Dance to cor∣respond with the Melody, so the Words or Song must, on a
like Principle, keep Pace with <HI>Both.</HI> Among the <HI>sa∣vage
Americans</HI> we see the first Rudiments of poetic Numbers, emerging from
this Source. For 
<Q REND="inline">"as the Means of adjusting the Words to the Air or
Melody, they sometimes strike off Syllables from their Words."</Q> And
such is the natural Generation of <HI>Rythm</HI> and <HI>Verse.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. Their earliest <HI>Histories</HI> would be written in
<HI>Verse.</HI> For we see, that among the savage Tribes, the Actions of 
<PB N="38" REF="37"/> their Heroes and Gods, and the great Events of their
Nation, make a principal Part of their Songs. When∣ever, therefore, the Use
of Letters should come among such a People, these <HI>ancient Songs</HI>
would naturally be <HI>first recorded,</HI> for the Information and Use of
future Times.</P>
<P N="6">6. Their most ancient <HI>Maxims, Exhortations,
Proverbs,</HI> or <HI>Laws,</HI> would probably be written in Verse. For
these would naturally make a Part of their <HI>Songs</HI> of Celebration, and
would by Degrees be <HI>selected</HI> from thence, would in Time become the
<HI>Standard</HI> of <HI>Right</HI> and <HI>Wrong,</HI> and as such, be
treasured up and appealed to by the improving Tribe.</P>
<P N="7">7. Their <HI>religious Rites</HI> would naturally be performed
or accompany'd by <HI>Dance</HI> and <HI>Song.</HI> For it appears from Fact
that the great Actions of their Gods and Heroes are the most general Subject
of the savage Dance and Song; and the common End of Pagan Rites hath ever
been, to praise the Gods of the Country, and by these Means (as well as by
Sacrifice) to appease their Wrath, or secure their Favour.</P>
<P N="8">8. Their <HI>earliest Oracles</HI> would probably be
delivered in <HI>Verse,</HI> and <HI>sung</HI> by the Priest or
Priestess of the supposed God. For these <HI>Oracles,</HI> being
supposed to be <HI>inspired</HI> by a deceased <HI>Chief</HI> (now a
<HI>Deity)</HI> who had himself delivered his Exhortations in this
<HI>enthusiastic Manner</HI>; and being ad∣dressed to a Tribe among
whom this Mode of Instruction universally prevailed, no other Vehicle but
that of <HI>Verse</HI> and <HI>Song</HI> could at first gain these
<HI>Oracles</HI> either <HI>Credit</HI> or <HI>Reception.</HI></P>
<P N="9">9. Their <HI>Melody</HI> would be <HI>simple</HI>; and
derive a consider∣able Part of its Power from its <HI>Rythm</HI> or
<HI>Measure,</HI> without <PB N="39" REF="38"/> any Mixture of <HI>artificial
Composition.</HI> First, because this Kind would be most suited to
the <HI>Powers</HI> of the barbarous <HI>Legislators</HI> or <HI>Bards,</HI>
at once <HI>Composers</HI> and <HI>Performers,</HI> among whom nothing
artificial or refined could as yet take Place. Secondly, because this
<HI>Simplicity</HI> of Manner would be best adapted to the Capacity of the
surrounding People, incapable, in this early Period, to be attracted or moved
by any thing but what <HI>Nature</HI> dictates.</P>
<P N="10">10. The Force of this simple Melody would be much
increased by the Power of early <HI>Association</HI> and continued
<HI>Habit.</HI> For this, by <HI>appropriating</HI> certain <HI>Sounds</HI> to
certain <HI>Subjects,</HI> would raise their Melody into a Kind of natural
and expressive Language of the Passions.</P>
<P N="11">11. Their <HI>Songs</HI> would be of a <HI>legislative</HI>
Cast; and being drawn chiefly from the Fables or History of their own
Country, would contain the essential Parts of their <HI>religious,
moral,</HI> and <HI>political</HI> Systems. For we have seen above, that
the <HI>Celebration</HI> of their deceased Heroes would of Course grow into
a <HI>religious</HI> Act: That the <HI>Exhortations</HI> and <HI>Maxims</HI>
intermixed with these Celebrations, and found∣ed on the <HI>Example</HI> of
their <HI>Heroe-Gods,</HI> would naturally become the <HI>Standard</HI> of
<HI>Right</HI> and <HI>Wrong</HI>; that is, the Foundation of <HI>private
Morals</HI> and <HI>public Law:</HI> And thus, the whole Fabric of their
<HI>Religion, Morals,</HI> and <HI>Polity,</HI> would naturally arise from,
and be included in their <HI>Songs,</HI> during their Progress from savage
to civilized Life.</P>
<P N="12">12. MUSIC, in the extended Sense of the Word (that is,
including Melody, Dance, and Song) would make an es∣sential and principal
Part in the <HI>Education</HI> of their Chil∣dren. For the important Principles
of their <HI>Religion, Morals,</HI> and <HI>Polity,</HI> being delivered and
inculcated in their <PB N="40" REF="39"/> <HI>Songs,</HI> no other Method could
be devised, which would so strongly impress the youthful Mind with the
<HI>approved Principles</HI> of <HI>Life</HI> and <HI>Action.</HI></P>
<P N="13">13. MUSIC therefore (in this extended Sense) must gain a
great and <HI>universal Power</HI> over the minds and Actions of such a
People. For through the Force of early and conti∣nued <HI>Habit,</HI> together
with the irresistible Contagion of general <HI>Example,</HI> while every
thing pleasing, great, and im∣portant, was conveyed through this Medium, and
through this only, such strong Impressions would strike themselves
into the growing Mind, as would give it its ruling Colour through Life, and
such as no future Incidents could easily weaken or efface.</P>
<P N="14">14. In the Course of Time, and the Progress of Polity and
Arts, a <HI>Separation</HI> of the several Parts or Branches of Music (in
its extended Sense) would naturally arise. Till a certain Period of
Civilization, Letters, and Art, the seve∣ral Kinds would of course lie
confused, in a Sort of un∣distinguished Mass, and be mingled in the
same Composi∣tion, as Inclination, Enthusiasm, or other Incidents might
impel. But repeated Trial and Experiment would natu∣rally produce a more
artificial Manner; and thus, by De∣grees, the several Kinds of Poem would
assume their legi∣timate Forms.</P>
<P N="15">15. If their warlike Character continued, the <HI>Dance</HI>
would naturally <HI>separate</HI> from the <HI>Song</HI>; and would itself
become a <HI>distinct Exercise</HI> or <HI>Art,</HI> for the sake of
increasing their Strength and Agility of Body, as the Means of ren∣dering
them invincible in War. For the Dance or Action of their Song-Feasts, being
only secondary, and merely an Appendage to the Song, would not be of a
Character suffi∣ciently <PB N="41" REF="40"/> severe for the fierce and
stubborn Contention of those who were destined to the immediate Toils of
warlike Service.</P>
<P N="16">16. After a certain Period of Civilization, the complex
Character of <HI>Legislator</HI> and <HI>Bard</HI> would <HI>separate,</HI>
or be seldom united. For as the Society grew more populous, and the
increasing Arts of Life increased the Labours and Cares of Government, the
<HI>musical Art</HI> (in its extended Sense) would of course be delegated
by the civil Magi∣strate, to such Men of Genius and Worth, as might apply
it to its proper Ends, the Instruction and Welfare of Man∣kind.</P>
<P N="17">17. <HI>Hymns</HI> or <HI>Odes</HI> would be composed, and
<HI>Sung</HI> by their Composers at their festal Solemnities. For these,
in their simple State, are but a Kind of rapturous Exclama∣tions of Joy,
Grief, Triumph, or Exultation, in Conse∣quence of some great or
disastrous Action, known, alluded to, or expressed: A Species of
Composition which naturally ariseth from the savage Song-Feast.</P>
<P N="18">18. The <HI>Epic Poem</HI> would naturally arise, and be
sung by its Composers at their public Solemnities. For it ap∣pears
above<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Article 5.</BIBL></NOTE>, that their
earliest Histories would be writ∣ten in Verse, and make a Part of their
public Song-Feasts. Now the <HI>Epic Poem</HI> is but a Kind of <HI>fabulous
History,</HI> rowling chiefly on the great Actions of ancient Gods and
Heroes, and artificially composed under certain Limi∣tations with Respect
to its <HI>Manner,</HI> for the Ends of Plea∣sure, Admiration, and
Instruction.</P>
<P N="19">19. From an <HI>Union</HI> of these two, a certain rude
Outline of <HI>Tragedy</HI> would naturally arise. We may see the first
Seeds or Principles of this Poem, in the Conduct of the savage
<HI>Song-Feast.</HI> A <HI>Chief sings</HI> some great Action of a 
<PB N="42" REF="41"/> God or Heroe: The surrounding <HI>Choir answer</HI>
him at In∣tervals, by Shouts of Sympathy or concurrent Appro∣bation.</P>
<P N="20">20. In Process of Time, this barbarous Scene would improve
into a more perfect Form: Instead of <HI>relating,</HI> they would probably
represent, by Action and Song united, those great or terrible Atchievements
which their Heroes had performed. For of this, too, we finds the Seeds or
Principles in the savage State. 
<Q REND="inline">"After a Chief of War hath recounted the Battles he
had fought, they who are present will often rise up to dance, and
represent those Actions with great Vivacity."</Q> If to this we add the
usual Exclamations of the surrounding Choir, we here behold the first
<HI>rude Form of savage Tragedy.</HI></P>
<P N="21">21. If the <HI>Choir</HI> should be
<HI>established</HI> by general Use, and should animate the Solemnity
by <HI>Dance</HI> as well as <HI>Song</HI>; the <HI>Melody, Dance,</HI> and
<HI>Song</HI> would of course <HI>regulate</HI> each other, and the
<HI>Ode</HI> or <HI>Song</HI> would fall into <HI>Stanzas</HI> of some
<HI>particular Kind.</HI> This appears from the third Article.</P>
<P N="22">22. Another Consequence of an <HI>established
Choir</HI> would be an unvaried Adherence to the <HI>Unities</HI> of
<HI>Place</HI> and <HI>Time.</HI> For a numerous Choir, maintaining their
Station through the whole Performance, must give so forcible a Con∣viction
to the Senses, of the <HI>Sameness</HI> of <HI>Place,</HI> and
<HI>Short∣ness</HI> of <HI>Time,</HI> that any Deviation from this apparent
Unity must shock the Imagination with an Improbability too gross to be
endured.</P>
<P N="23">23. Not only the Part of the tragic <HI>Choir,</HI> but the
<HI>Episode</HI> or <HI>interlocutory</HI> Part would be also
<HI>sung.</HI> For as the <HI>Ode</HI> and <HI>Epic</HI> would be
<HI>sung</HI> from the earliest Periods; so when they became
<HI>united,</HI> and by that Union formed the <PB N="43" REF="42"/> tragic
Species, they of Course maintained the same Ap∣pendage of <HI>Melody,</HI>
which Nature and Custom had already given them.</P>
<P N="24">24. While the Nation held its <HI>fierce</HI> and
<HI>warlike</HI> Cha∣racter, the <HI>tragic</HI> Representations would
chiefly turn on Subjects <HI>distressful</HI> or <HI>terrible.</HI> For
thus they would ani∣mate each other to <HI>Victory</HI> and <HI>Revenge,</HI>
by a Representa∣tion of what their <HI>Friends</HI> had <HI>done</HI> and
<HI>suffered.</HI> These Subjects would likewise be most accommodated
to the natural Taste of the poetic Chiefs of such a People; whose
Atchievements must produce and abound with Events of Distress and Terror.
They also would be best suited to the Genius and Ends of their State and
Polity: For as the leading View of such a fierce and warlike People must be
to destroy Pity and Fear; so this would most effectually be done, by
making themselves familiar with distressful and terrible
Representations. The gentle Passions, and less affecting Actions, which
might fill the Spectacles of a mild and peaceful Nation, would be insipid to
the Taste, and incompatible with the Character, of such a warlike
People.</P>
<P N="25">25. As their Tragedy would be intended as a <HI>visible
Representation</HI> of their ancient Gods and Heroes, so it would be
natural for them to invent some Means of <HI>strengthening</HI> the
<HI>Voice,</HI> and <HI>aggrandising</HI> the <HI>Visage</HI> and
<HI>Person,</HI> as the means of compleating the Resemblance: For in all
Savage Countries, the <HI>tallest</HI> and <HI>strongest</HI> Men are
generally selected as their <HI>Chiefs.</HI></P>
<P N="26">26. As their Tragic <HI>Poets</HI> would be <HI>Singers,</HI>
so they would be <HI>Actors,</HI> and perform some capital Part in their
own Pieces for the Stage. For we see these different Cha∣racters are
naturally united in the savage State: There∣fore, <PB N="44" REF="43"/> till
some extraordinary Change in Manners and Prin∣ciples should ensue, this
<HI>Union</HI> would of Course continue.</P>
<P N="27">27. <HI>Musical Contests</HI> would be admitted as
<HI>public Exer∣cises</HI> in such a State. For we have seen, that the
impor∣tant Articles of Religion, Morals, and Polity, would natu∣rally make a
Part of their public Songs: therefore public Contests of this Kind would be
regarded as the best and surest Means of raising an Emulation of a
most useful Na∣ture; and of strengthening the State, by inforcing all the
fundamental Principles of Society in the most striking and effectual
Manner.</P>
<P N="28">28. The Profession of <HI>Bard</HI> or
<HI>Musician</HI> would be held as very honourable, and of high Esteem. For
he would be vested with a Kind of <HI>public Character:</HI> and if not an
original Legislator, yet still he would be regarded as a
<HI>subordinate</HI> and <HI>useful Servant</HI> of the <HI>State.</HI></P>
<P N="29">29. <HI>Odes,</HI> or <HI>Hymns,</HI> would naturally make a
Part of their <HI>domestic Entertainments:</HI> and the <HI>Chiefs</HI> would
be proud to signalize themselves by their Skill in <HI>Melody</HI> and
<HI>Song.</HI> For their Songs being enriched with all the great and im∣portant
Subjects relative to the public State; nothing could be more suitable to a
high Station in the Commonwealth, than a Proficiency in this sublime and
legislative Art.</P>
<P N="30">30. When <HI>Music</HI> had attained to this State of
relative Perfection, it would be regarded as a <HI>necessary
Accom∣plishment.</HI> And if any Man, or Society of Men, were unacquainted
with the Practice and Power of Music, their Ignorance in this Art would be
regarded as a capital De∣fect: For it would imply a Deficiency in the three
great leading Articles of Education, <HI>Religion, Morals,</HI> and
<HI>Po∣lity.</HI></P>
<P N="31"><PB N="45" REF="44"/>31. The Genius of their <HI>Music</HI>
would <HI>vary</HI> along with their <HI>Manners:</HI> For Manners being the
leading and most essential Quality of Man; All his other Tastes and
Ac∣quirements naturally correspond with <HI>These</HI>; and accom∣modate
themselves to his Manners, as to their chief and original Cause.</P>
<P N="32">32. As a Change of Manners must influence their Mu∣sic,
so, by a reciprocal Action, a Change in their Music must influence
Manners: For we have seen, that Music was the <HI>established
Vehicle</HI> of all the great Principles of Education: Therefore a Change in
Music must tend to bring on a Change in <HI>These.</HI></P>
<P N="33">33. A Provident Community of Principles, uncommonly severe,
would probably fix both the Subjects and Move∣ments of Song and Dance, by Law:
This would arise from their Knowledge of the mutual Influence of Man∣ners and
Music on each other.</P>
<P N="34">34. In a Society of more libertine and relaxed Princi∣ples,
the Corruption of Music would naturally arise, along with the Corruption of
Manners; for the Reasons now assigned: and the Musicians, Bards, or
Poets, would be the immediate Instruments of this Corruption. For being
educated in a corrupt State they would be apt to debase their Art to vile and
immoral Purposes, as the means of gaining that Applause which would be the
natural Ob∣ject of their Ambition.</P>
<P N="35">35. In Consequence of this Corruption, a gradual and total
<HI>Separation</HI> of the <HI>Bard's</HI> or <HI>Musician's</HI> complex
Cha∣racter would ensue. For the <HI>Chief</HI> would now no longer pride
himself on the Character of <HI>Poet</HI> or Performer; nor the <HI>Man</HI>
of <HI>Genius</HI> and <HI>Worth</HI> descend to the Profession 
<PB N="46" REF="45" MS="y"/> of <HI>Lyrist, Singer,</HI> or <HI>Actor:</HI>
Because these Professions, which had formerly been the Means of
inculcating every thing laudable and great, would now (when perverted to the
contrary Purposes) be disdained by the Wise and Vir∣tuous.</P>
<P N="36">36. Hence the Power, the Utility and Dignity of
<HI>Music</HI> would sink into a general Corruption and Contempt. This
Consequence is so plain, as to need no Illustration.</P>

<DIV1 N="5" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. V. An Application of these Principles to the Melody,
Dance, and Song, of ancient <HI>Greece.</HI></HEAD>
<P>SUCH may seem to be the Consequences which would naturally
arise in a savage, free, and warlike State, should <HI>Letters</HI> be
introduced and cultivated among such a spirited and active People. In
Support of the Truth of these Deductions, let us now endeavour to
<HI>realize</HI> them; by shewing that such Consequences did in Fact
arise in ancient GREECE. In the Course of this Review, which will con∣tain
the Rise, Progress, Power, Perfection, Separation, and Corruption, of their
<HI>Melody, Dance,</HI> and <HI>Song,</HI> we may per∣haps be fortunate enough,
on the Principles here given, to fix some Things which have been held
doubtful, to unfold others which have hitherto been confessedly
unaccountable, and to resolve others into their proper and evident Causes,
which have been attributed to such Causes as never had Existence.</P>
<P N="1">1. "Their Idea of <HI>Music,</HI> in its most inlarged
Sense, comprehended the three Circumstances of <HI>Melody, Dance,</HI> and
<HI>Song.</HI>"—This appears from the concurrent Testi∣mony 
<PB N="47" REF="46"/> of many ancient Authors: The following one from the
<HI>Alcibiades</HI> of PLATO may alone be a sufficient Autho∣rity. 
<Q REND="inline">"<HI>Socr.</HI> Tell me first, what Art is that,
to which it belongs properly to <HI>sing,</HI> to <HI>play,</HI> and
<HI>dance?</HI> Cannot you find a Name for this comprehensive
Art?—<HI>Alcib.</HI> I cannot.—<HI>Socr.</HI> Try a little: Who are
the Goddesses that preside over this Art?—<HI>Alcib.</HI> Do you
mean the MUSES?—<HI>Socr.</HI> I do: Consider then, what Name the Art
receives from them.—<HI>Alcib.</HI> You seem to hint at
MUSIC.—<HI>Socr.</HI> You are right<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>PLATO,
ALCIBIADES.</BIBL></NOTE>."</Q>—The same Truth is no less evident
from the circumstantial Account which ATHENAEUS gives of the old ARCADIAN
<HI>Music</HI>; which, in its general Acceptation, included <HI>Melody,
Dance,</HI> and <HI>Song</HI><NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot"><BIBL><HI>Deipnosoph.</HI> l. xiv.</BIBL></NOTE>. It appears,
then, that this Combination or Union of these three <HI>Sister-Graces</HI>
arose naturally in ancient GREECE, from an Improvement of the
<HI>savage</HI> State into a certain Degree of <HI>Civilization.</HI> They
needed no <HI>Art</HI> to joyn them: For as they <HI>naturally</HI> produce
each other, and are naturally conjoyned in the savage and uncultivated State,
this Union would of Course continue, till some vio∣lent Change in Manners
or Principles should break that Union which Nature had
established.—It appears no less evidently from ancient Writers,
that what we call <HI>Instru∣mental Music,</HI> that is, the Melody of
Instruments, unac∣company'd by Dance or Song, was a Thing never held in
Esteem till the later Periods of Antiquity, in which a general Separation
took Place. This will appear more at large hereafter. PLATO calls
Instrumental Music 
<Q REND="inline">"an <HI>un∣meaning Thing,</HI> and an <HI>Abuse of
Melody</HI><NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot"><BIBL><HI>De Legi∣bus,</HI> l.
i.</BIBL></NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P N="2"><PB N="48" REF="47"/>2. "In the earliest Periods of the
<HI>Greek</HI> States, their Legislators were often Bards, or their Bards
were Legis∣lators." Such, in a more eminent Degree, were A∣POLLO, ORPHEUS,
AMPHION, LINUS, and MUSAEUS<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>PLATO <HI>de
Rep.</HI> l. ii.</BIBL></NOTE>. Of this Rank too, was THALES the
<HI>Cretan</HI> Lawgiver; who composed Laws in Verse, and sung them to
his Lyre<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>STRABO <HI>Geog.</HI> l.
x.</BIBL></NOTE>. It hath been generally supposed, that the story'd Power
of their Lyres and Songs meant no more, than by a metaphorical Expression
to convey a strong Idea of their Eloquence and legislative Art, in
producing <HI>Order</HI> from <HI>Confusion.</HI> Thus PLUTARCH tells us,
that 
<Q REND="inline">"the An∣cients represented the Statues of the Gods
with Musical Instruments in their Hands, not as being really Lyres or
Flutes; but because they thought, that nothing so much suited the
Character and Office of the Gods, as <HI>Harmony</HI> and <HI>Order</HI><NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>PLUT. <HI>de Procreat. Animae,</HI>
&amp;c.</BIBL></NOTE>."</Q> Thus too, a noble Writer of our own Country
declares his Opinion, and says, that 
<Q REND="inline">"<HI>Tra∣dition,</HI> which soon grew
<HI>fabulous,</HI> could not better repre∣sent the first <HI>Founders</HI>
or Establishers of large Societies, than as <HI>real Songsters</HI><NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot"><BIBL><HI>Characteristics,</HI> vol. i. p.
237.</BIBL></NOTE>."</Q> But <HI>real Songsters,</HI> be∣yond Doubt, they
were; nor was Tradition <HI>fabulous</HI> in thus representing them. For from
a View of human Na∣ture, as emerging from the savage State, it is evident,
that the <HI>Song</HI> and <HI>Lyre</HI> (as soon as the Lyre was invented)
must be the natural Means or Instruments of Civilization, by conveying the
Legislator's Precepts to the surrounding People. For we have seen that,
among the savage Tribes, the <HI>Chiefs</HI> are proud to signalize
themselves by <HI>Song</HI>; that they <HI>preside</HI> at the <HI>Song
Feasts</HI>; and that their Songs rowl <PB N="49" REF="48"/> principally on
the great Actions, Affairs, and Events of their own Nation.—A concurrent
Proof of this natural Union of the Bard's and Legislator's Office might be
drawn, were it necessary, from the Name which the old THESSALIANS gave
their <HI>Magistrates:</HI> They styled them
<GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, or 
<Q REND="inline">"the Leaders of the Dance and Song-Feast<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>LUCIAN. <HI>de Saltatione.</HI></BIBL></NOTE>:"</Q> A
Circumstance which plainly points out its own Origin.</P>
<P N="3">3. "Their most ancient Gods were stiled <HI>Singers</HI>
and Dancers." Thus HORACE calls APOLLO the <HI>Singer</HI><NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot"><BIBL><HI>Ep. ad Pisones.</HI></BIBL></NOTE>. PINDAR stiles
him the <HI>Dancer</HI><NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot"><BIBL><HI>Ode.</HI></BIBL></NOTE>. HOMER, of the Au∣thor of the
Hymns that pass under his Name, gives him the same Appellation<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Hymn. in Apollinem.</BIBL></NOTE>. RHEA, the Mother of
JUPITER, is said to have taught her Priests the Art of <HI>Dancing,</HI>
both in PHRYGIA and CRETE<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>LUCIAN. <HI>de
Saltatione.</HI></BIBL></NOTE>: As CASTOR and POLLUX instructed the
<HI>Lacedemonians</HI> in the same Art<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Ibid.</BIBL></NOTE>. EUMELUS or ARCTINUS the
<HI>Corinthian</HI> brings in even JUPITER himself <HI>dancing,</HI> in
these Words, 
<Q>Among them danc'd the Sire of Gods and Men<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot"><BIBL><HI>Apud.</HI> ATHENAEUM <HI>Deipn.</HI> l.
i.</BIBL></NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>Whence it arose, that these ancient Gods were repre∣sented as
<HI>Singers</HI> and <HI>Dancers,</HI> and vested with a Quality which at
first Sight seems altogether foreign to their Cha∣racter, hath not as yet
been accounted for. We now see the true and natural Origin of these
Appellations. For the most ancient Gods, among the civilized <HI>Greeks,</HI>
were their early Legislators, who taught the savage Tribes the first Arts
of Life. These deceased Legislators, therefore, when ad∣vanced to the
Rank of Gods, were naturally delivered down <PB N="50" REF="49"/> to
Posterity, with the same Attributes or Qualities by which they
distinguished themselves in Life: and it ap∣pears from a View of the
<HI>Chiefs</HI> of the savage Tribes, that these Qualities would naturally
be those of <HI>Dance</HI> and <HI>Song.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. "Measured Periods, or, in other Words, Rythm, Numbers,
and Verse, did naturally arise." The general Reason is assigned in
the fourth Article of the last Section; and needs not to be repeated here.
But as some particular Consequences arise from this Foundation, relative
to the most ancient <HI>History, Laws,</HI> and <HI>Oracles,</HI> these
will deserve a separate Consideration.</P>
<P N="5">5. "Their earliest Histories were written in Verse."
This Fact is indisputable; but seems not, as yet, to have been resolved
into its true Cause. STRABO informs us, that, "The Poetic Form first
appeared: They who imi∣tated it, dropped the Measure: Such were CADMUS the
<HI>Milesian,</HI> PHERECYDES and HECATAEUS<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>STRABO, l. i.</BIBL></NOTE>. These were the first
<HI>Greek</HI> Historians who writ in <HI>Prose.</HI> Another learned
Ancient confirms this Account; and says, 
<Q REND="inline">"In these early Times, so general was the
Inclination to Rythm and Numbers, that all Instruction was given in Verse:
There was neither <HI>History</HI> nor <HI>Philosophy,</HI> nor any Action
to be described, but what was dressed by the <HI>Muses</HI><NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>PLUTARCH.</BIBL></NOTE>"</Q>. Not only the <HI>Greek</HI>
Writers give a con∣current Testimony concerning the Priority of
<HI>historical Verse</HI> to <HI>Prose,</HI> but the Records of all
Nations unite in con∣firming it. The oldest Compositions among the ARABS
are in Rythm or rude Verse; and are often cited as Proofs <PB N="51" REF="50"/> of the Truth of their subsequent History<NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot"><BIBL><HI>Hist. de las Guerras Civil. de
Grenada.</HI></BIBL></NOTE>. The Ac∣counts we have of the <HI>Peruvian</HI>
Story confirm the same Fact: For GARCILASSO tells us, that he compiled a Part
of his <HI>Commentaries</HI> from the <HI>ancient Songs</HI> of the
Coun∣try<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot"><BIBL><HI>Comment. Real.</HI></BIBL></NOTE>.
Nay all the <HI>American</HI> Tribes who have any Com∣positions, are found to
establish the same Truth<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>LAFITAU.</BIBL></NOTE>. Nor∣thern EUROPE contributes its
Share of Testimony: For there, too, we find the <HI>Scythian</HI> or
<HI>Runic</HI> Songs (many of them <HI>historical)</HI> to be the oldest
Compositions among these barbarous Nations<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>BARTHOLIN. <HI>de Contemptu Motis,</HI> &amp;c. HICKES
<HI>Thes. Septentr.</HI></BIBL></NOTE>. ODIN is said to have boasted,
that 
<Q REND="inline">"his Runic Poems were given him by the Gods<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>SHERINGHAM <HI>Orig. Gent.
Angl.</HI></BIBL></NOTE>."</Q> A Circumstance which proves them to have been
of the high∣est Antiquity.</P>
<P>The Fact, then, is clear and certain: And as it is some∣what
mysterious to common Apprehension, various Solu∣tions have been attempted
by the Learned; though, in my Opinion, without Success. I shall give them,
as they ap∣pear in various Writers.</P>
<P>LONGINUS hath aimed at something like a Reason, in the following
Passage: 
<Q REND="inline">"Measure belongs <HI>naturally</HI> to Poetry, as
its Province is the Description and <HI>Language</HI> of the
<HI>Passions</HI>; together with <HI>Fiction</HI> or Fable, which
<HI>produce Numbers.</HI> Hence it was that the Ancients (even in their common
Discourse) used Measure and Verse, rather than Prose<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>LONGIN. <HI>de Metr.</HI></BIBL></NOTE>."</Q> It can hardly
be necessary to observe, that the celebrated Critic, in this Passage,
gives a mere <HI>Affirmation</HI> instead of an <HI>Argument.</HI> He says,
indeed, <PB N="52" REF="51"/> 
<Q REND="inline">"that the Language of the Passions, and Fiction,
natu∣rally produce Measure and Numbers:"</Q> But the Reason is still to
seek. It were to be wished, that in many Parts of his Writings, he had not
given us more Instances of his fine Taste, than his Power of
Reasoning.</P>
<P>A learned Modern of our own Nation hath try'd his Talent in this
curious Question. 
<Q REND="inline">"They (the Ancients) thought, it would seem, that
Language was the first Tamer of Men; and took its Origin to have been
cer∣tain rude accidental Sounds, which that naked Company of scrambling
Mortals emitted by Chance. Upon this Supposition it will follow, that at
first they uttered these Sounds in a <HI>much higher Note</HI> than we do
our Words now; occasioned, <HI>perhaps,</HI> by their falling on them under
some Passion, Fear, Wonder, or Pain; and then using the same Sound,
either when the Object or Accident re∣curred, or when they wanted to describe
it by what they felt from its Presence. <HI>Neither</HI> the
<HI>Syllables</HI> nor the <HI>Tone</HI> could be <HI>ascertained:</HI> but
when prompted by the Return of the Passion, under which they invented them,
they <HI>extended</HI> their <HI>Throats</HI> and put several of these
Marks together, they would <HI>seem</HI> to <HI>sing.</HI> Hence
<GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> signified at first simply
to <HI>speak,</HI> or utter the Voice; which now, with a small Abbreviation
(<GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>) signifies to <HI>sing:</HI>
And hence came the ancient Opinion, which ap∣pears so <HI>strange</HI> to
<HI>Us,</HI> that Poetry was before Prose<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot"><BIBL><HI>Enq. into the Life</HI> of HOMER, p.
38.</BIBL></NOTE>."</Q> Here we see an ingenious Writer toiling in vain to
prop a mistaken Principle. For, to omit all the weak Parts of the Paragraph
which might expose it to Ridicule, if nei∣ther <PB N="53" REF="52"/>
<HI>Syllables</HI> nor <HI>Tones</HI> could be <HI>ascertained,</HI> it
follows, that neither <HI>Measure</HI> nor <HI>Melody</HI> could arise; and
therefore it must even continue to appear as strange as ever, 
<Q REND="inline">"that Poetry should be before Prose."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. DE VOLTAIRE talks more speciously (after ARIS∣TOTLE and
PLUTARCH<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">See the following Articles.</NOTE>) on this
Subject. 
<Q REND="inline">"Before HERODOTUS, even History was not written
but in Verse among the GREEKS, who had borrowed this Custom from the
ancient EGYPTIANS, the wisest, the best po∣liced, and the most knowing
People upon Earth. This Custom was very <HI>reasonable:</HI> for the End of
History was to preserve to Posterity the <HI>Memory</HI> of those few
great Men, whose Example might be of Service to Mankind. They only writ what
was worthy of being retained by Heart. This is the Reason why they laid hold
of the Harmony of <HI>Verse</HI>; that they might aid the <HI>Memory.</HI>
And hence it was, that the first <HI>Philosophers, Legislators,</HI> and
<HI>Historians,</HI> were all <HI>Poets</HI><NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot"><BIBL><HI>Preface à Oedip.</HI></BIBL></NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>As this is the most plausible Reason that hath as yet been
assigned for this mysterious Fact, it will deserve a particular
Consideration. The Cause assigned seems, there∣fore, to rest on no
probable Foundation, for the following Reasons.</P>
<P>First, because it seems to take for granted the Existence of
the very Thing which it is said to have produced. If we suppose Rythm,
Numbers, and Verse, to exist and be in general Use, they would
undoubtedly become the natu∣ral Means of Memory and Record among a barbarous
Peo∣ple. But to <HI>invent</HI> the Vehicle of <HI>Rythm,</HI> from a
<HI>Foresight</HI> <PB N="54" REF="53"/> of its being the best Instrument
of Memory, without any prior Impulse from unassisted Nature, seems
altogether in∣compatible with the general Character of the savage Tribes: For
in the Period of savage Manners, the Power of <HI>ab∣stract
Reasoning</HI> is always <HI>weak,</HI> and is often found to have <HI>no
Place.</HI></P>
<P>Again: The <HI>Universality</HI> of the Fact adds greatly to the
Improbability of the Cause assigned. Though we should suppose it
possible or probable, that one savage Chief might by Dint of Reason
strike out this new method of recording History; yet that <HI>All</HI>
savage Chiefs, in every known Age and Climate, should <HI>unite</HI> in the
<HI>same</HI> Contrivance, is highly improbable. If one of more exalted
Capacity de∣livered his Stories in Verse, <HI>another</HI> of inferior Reach
and Invention would naturally give them to Posterity in plain Prose: Nay,
the acknowledged Difficulty of <HI>Versification</HI> would naturally make
the <HI>prosaic</HI> Manner the more <HI>com∣mon,</HI> though less
effectual Method of the two. Now, the contrary to this is acknowledged to be
true, even by those who contend for the Truth and Sufficiency of the Cause
assigned. The <HI>Universality</HI> of the Fact is allowed by All. Such
an universal Coincidence, therefore, must spring from some other
Cause, such as ariseth unalterably from Na∣ture, and takes Place among
the savage Tribes in an universal and unvaried Manner.</P>
<P>Farther: If the ancient Songs, prior to prose in every Nation, had
been <HI>coolly composed,</HI> for the Sake of <HI>Tradition</HI> and
<HI>Information only,</HI> they would have been <HI>circumstantial</HI> and
<HI>precise:</HI> Whereas the contrary appears in their Con∣struction: They
are generally <HI>vague</HI> and <HI>enthusiastic</HI>; and 
<PB N="55" REF="54"/> bear all the Marks of being the genuine Effects of
savage <HI>Passion</HI> and <HI>Enthusiasm.</HI> So far are they from
containing any regular <HI>Series</HI> of Facts, that Facts are often
<HI>hinted</HI> only; while the mere <HI>Celebration</HI> of the Heroe forms
the chief Weight and <HI>Burthen</HI> of the <HI>Song.</HI></P>
<P>Lastly, the universal Connexion of the <HI>old Poetry</HI> with
<HI>Melody,</HI> and the unvary'd Custom of <HI>singing it,</HI> amounts to
the strongest Proof, that the mere End of <HI>Memory</HI> and
<HI>Tradition</HI> could not be its original Cause. For had the sole
Intention of the Song been that of <HI>Record only,</HI> a <HI>mere
Recitation</HI> of the Verses would have answered the same Purpose. And
we may affirm it to be a <HI>moral Impossibility</HI> that an universal
Union of Verse and Melody could have taken Place on this Foundation.</P>
<P>Since, therefore, the Cause hitherto assigned seems
alto∣gether inadequate to the Effect; can we reasonably enter∣tain a Doubt,
in resolving it into that Principle which we have already found universally
predominant in savage Life? I mean, the natural Passion for
<HI>Melody</HI> and <HI>Dance,</HI> which necessarily throws the
accompanying <HI>Song</HI> into a <HI>correspon∣dent Rythm.</HI> Hence, the
Use of Rythm and Verse must naturally arise in GREECE (as in every
other Country emerging from Barbarity) because Melody, Dance, and Song, made
a principal Employment of their savage State. And hence, their earliest
Histories must of course be writ∣ten in Verse; because the Actions of
their Gods and He∣roes made a principal Part of their Songs; and therefore,
when the Use of Letters came among them, these ancient Songs were naturally
<HI>first</HI> recorded, that is, they became <PB N="56" REF="55"/> their
earliest <HI>Histories,</HI> for the Information and Use of fu∣ture
Times.</P>
<P>As this Cause, when viewed in itself, seems amply and clearly
to account for the Effect, so it will receive farther Confirmation, if we
consider how naturally it removes all those Objections which load the
Opinion here controvert∣ed. For it neither requires nor supposeth any Power
of <HI>abstract Reasoning</HI> among the <HI>savage</HI> Tribes, but is
the mere Effect of <HI>Passion</HI> and uncultivated Nature. Its
Uni∣versality, therefore, becomes highly probable; because the Principles
of savage Nature (making Allowance for the Difference of Soil and Climate)
are every where the same. The <HI>Genius</HI> of the ancient Songs of every
Nation adds new Degrees of Evidence: For they are generally irregular and
enthusiastic; and therefore the genuine Productions of <HI>unlettered
Enthusiasm.</HI> Lastly, their universal Connexion with
<HI>Melody,</HI> and the unvary'd Practice of <HI>singing</HI> them, comes up
to a full and direct Proof, of the Reality of the Cause now assigned.</P>
<P>It must not be disguised, that the most learned VOSSIUS was
so struck with the Difficulty of accounting for this Appearance, that he
thinks it best to deny the Fact. 
<Q REND="inline">"To me the contrary seems true; that Prose was
first writ∣ten, and then Poetry. Tis natural to walk on Foot before we mount
on Horseback; and it is certain that M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> first <HI>spoke</HI> in <HI>Prose,</HI> and <HI>then</HI> in
<HI>Numbers.</HI> We have nothing more ancient than the Writings of MOSES; and
these are in Prose, with Songs intermixed<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot"><BIBL><HI>De Artis Poët. Nat. et Const.</HI> c.
i.</BIBL></NOTE>."</Q> On this Reasoning it may be remarked, that although it
be <PB N="57" REF="56"/> certain that Men <HI>spoke</HI> in <HI>Prose</HI>
before they <HI>spoke</HI> in <HI>Verse</HI>; yet the Consequence follows
not, that therefore they must <HI>write</HI> in <HI>Prose</HI> before they
<HI>writ</HI> in <HI>Verse.</HI> The sole Question is, what would be
deemed best worth recording, on the first Rise of the <HI>writing
Art?</HI> Surely, the Actions and Celebrations of their Ancestors, Gods, and
Heroes: Now these, we have already seen, must naturally make the chief
Subject of their festal Songs; and therefore their <HI>festal Songs</HI>
were of Course the <HI>first</HI> things <HI>written</HI> or
<HI>recorded.</HI></P>
<P>With respect to the Instance alledged by the learned Critic, of
the Writings of MOSES, and the Practice of an∣cient EGYPT, this, when properly
explained, will confirm the Truth of the Cause here given. MOSES, we know,
was learned in all the Wisdom of the <HI>Egyptians:</HI> EGYPT was, in his
Time, become a <HI>polished Nation</HI>; and therefore, according to the
natural Course of Things (as will appear below) <HI>Prose</HI> had been
introduced before the Time of MOSES, as it was afterwards in GREECE by
HECATAEUS and others. As to the intermixed Songs in the Writ∣ings of MOSES, it
is now a Point agreed among the Learned, that they are written in
<HI>Measure</HI>; and correspond in all Respects with the Principle here
delivered. And that <HI>Song</HI> was the oldest Form of Composition in
EGYPT, we learn clearly from two ancient Writers: The First in∣forms us, that
their Music and Songs had continued un∣changed, for upwards of three
thousand Years<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>PLATO <HI>de Rep.</HI> l.
vii.</BIBL></NOTE>: The other gives a more particular Account of their Nature,
and Manner of being sung. 
<Q REND="inline">"The first of the Priests who used to appear
in the religious Procession, was a <HI>Choragus,</HI> <PB N="58" REF="57"/>
<HI>Bard,</HI> or <HI>Singer,</HI> who carried the Symbol of Music, and could
repeat by Heart the two first Books of MERCURY; the first containing
<HI>Hymns</HI> in Honour of the Gods; the second containing
<HI>Sentences</HI> or <HI>Maxims</HI> for the Conduct of a King<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>CLEMENS ALEXANDR. <HI>Stromat.</HI> l.

<P N="6">6. "Their most ancient <HI>Maxims, Exhortations,
Pro∣verbs,</HI> or <HI>Laws</HI> were written in <HI>Verse.</HI>" Having
traced the Antiquity of <HI>Song</HI> and <HI>poetic History</HI> to its true
and natural Cause, the present Article will be of easy Discussion.
For as the Greek Songs and poetic Stories were fraught with the great Actions
of their Gods and Heroes, so <HI>Maxims</HI> of <HI>Exhortation,</HI> which
in barbarous Countries hold the Place of <HI>Laws,</HI> must of Course make
a Part of these public Songs, must by Degrees be selected from them, and
in Time be appealed to, as the <HI>Standard</HI> of <HI>Right</HI> and
<HI>Wrong.</HI></P>
<P>However, as ARISTOTLE hath hinted at another Cause, the
slightest Conjecture of so great a Name must not pass unnoticed. He
puts the Question thus. 
<Q REND="inline">"Why are many <HI>Songs</HI> called by the name of
<HI>Laws?</HI> Was it because, be∣fore the Invention of the Art of Writing,
<HI>Laws</HI> were <HI>sung,</HI> lest they should be
<HI>forgotten</HI><NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot"><BIBL><HI>Problem.</HI> Sect. xix.
Art. 28.</BIBL> He is followed in this Opinion by the learned Mr. GOGUET, in
his late Book on Laws and Government.

remark, First, that the Opinion is delivered as a mere Conjecture. Secondly,
that all the Difficulties which load the common Opinion concerning 
<PB N="59" REF="58"/> the first Rise of <HI>poetic History,</HI> lie
equally heavy upon <HI>this:</HI> And lastly, that the same Solution leads
us up to the true Cause, on the natural Principles of the <HI>savage
Song-Feast.</HI> This Solution may, perhaps, in the Opinion of some,
re∣ceive additional Confirmation from the concurrent Autho∣rity of CASAUBON;
who declares it his Belief (though he assigns no Reason) that the Songs
called <HI>Nomoi</HI> were <HI>Frag∣ments</HI> of ancient Poetry, which had
been selected and pre∣served on Account of their Utility<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot"><BIBL><HI>In</HI> LAERT.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P N="7">7. "Their earliest <HI>religious Rites</HI> were performed
or ac∣companied by <HI>Dance</HI> and <HI>Song.</HI>"—The <HI>Orgys</HI>
of BAC∣CHUS, celebrated in this Manner, were famed through all the Ages of
Antiquity. STRABO tells us, that 
<Q REND="inline">"the <HI>Greeks</HI> retained the Custom
<HI>common</HI> to the <HI>Barbarians,</HI> of celebrating their Sacrifices to
the Gods with Music, consisting of Dance, Melody, and Song:"</Q> And
highly extolls this Practice, 
<Q REND="inline">"as tending to unite the Soul with God<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>STRABO, l.</BIBL></NOTE>."</Q> PLUTARCH adds his
Testimony, and in∣forms us, that in GREECE 
<Q REND="inline">"the first Application of Music was to religious
Ceremonies, in Honour of the Gods<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>PLUT. <HI>de
Musica.</HI></BIBL></NOTE>."</Q> All this flows naturally from the view we
have given of savage Life and Manners: For we have seen that the Praises
of their Chiefs are the most general Topic of the savage Dance and Song;
and the <HI>Grecian Gods</HI> were no other than their <HI>deceased
Chieftains.</HI></P>
<P N="8">8. "Their earliest <HI>Oracles</HI> were delivered in
Verse, and sung by the Priest or Priestess of the supposed God."
The natural Cause of this Fact hath been assigned in the Article which
corresponds with this. The ancients knew <PB N="60" REF="59" MS="y"/> and
confessed the Fact, but were so entirely ignorant of the true Cause,
that they <HI>laboured</HI> more in this Point, than even in accounting for the
Rise of <HI>poetic History</HI> and <HI>Laws.</HI> This will appear from
PLUTARCH, who hath written a Discourse on the following Question, 
<Q REND="inline">"Why the PYTHIA no longer gives her Oracles in
Verse?"</Q> Now, before he assigned the Causes why this Practice of
<HI>Oracular Verse</HI> had <HI>ceased,</HI> it was natural that he
should inquire how it first <HI>began:</HI> And the Causes (if such
they may be called) which he assigns, are these.</P>
<P>First, 
<Q REND="inline">"The ancient Times produced a Race of Men, who had
naturally, and from <HI>bodily Temperament,</HI> a stronger Turn for
Poetry."</Q> Secondly, 
<Q REND="inline">"There was a Time, when, instead of the Art of
Writing, Men used Metre, Verse, or Songs; adapting History, and other the
weightiest Subjects, to Poetry and Music." "Thus they celebrated the Gods;
and told their Fables in Verse, some through the Force of <HI>Genius,</HI>
and others by the Power of <HI>Custom.</HI>" "Therefore the God permitted the
Application of Verse and Song to his Oracles, and would not drive the Muses
from his Tripod."</Q> Thirdly, 
<Q REND="inline">"The Utility of Poetry is in nothing more
conspicuous, than in its Assistance to the <HI>Memory,</HI> by the
Means of Num∣bers. The Ancients had great Need of This, beyond the Moderns,
because the Oracles referred to Persons, Things, and Places, which were
often unknown to them<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>PLUT. <HI>Diss. Cur
nunc Pythia non reddat oracula carmine.</HI></BIBL></NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>Thus the learned PLUTARCH; whose weak Reasonings (weak because
he wanted Facts to lead him to the Truth) <PB N="61" REF="60"/> hardly need a
Confutation. For how came it so to pass, that the first Race of Men were
by <HI>natural bodily Tempera∣ment</HI> of a <HI>stronger Turn</HI> to
<HI>Poetry?</HI> How came it so to pass, that they told their Fables in
Verse, some by the Force of <HI>Genius,</HI> others by the Power of
<HI>Custom?</HI> These Affirma∣tions take for granted the very Point in
Question.</P>
<P>With Respect to the last Reason which the great Author
assigns, 
<Q REND="inline">"The Utility of Numbers, as an Assistance to
the Memory;"</Q> This, when applied to <HI>Oracles,</HI> is not only
in∣cumbered with all the Difficulties which load the common System concerning
the Origin of <HI>poetic History</HI> and <HI>Laws</HI>; but is contrary to
the clear Evidence of Facts, which assure us that the earliest poetic
Oracles were the Effect of <HI>Enthu∣siasm.</HI> For APOLLO, the God of
<HI>Music,</HI> was their Author; The <HI>Pythia</HI> or
<HI>Priestless</HI> was his <HI>Vicegerent</HI>; and PAUSA∣NIAS informs us,
that PHAEMONOE (the Sister of APOLLO) was the first Priestess; and that

<Q REND="inline">"she delivered her pro∣phetic Inspirations with
frantic Gestures <HI>(Dance)</HI> and in heroic <HI>Verse</HI> and
<HI>Song</HI><NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>PAUS. <HI>in
Phocicis.</HI></BIBL></NOTE>."</Q> PLUTARCH tells us farther concerning this
<HI>savage Heroine,</HI> that 
<Q REND="inline">"she is said to have <HI>celebrated
Herself</HI> in her <HI>Songs</HI>; and boasted, that she should not
cease to prophecy after her Death: That she would ascend to the Moon, and
be metamorphosed into that Face which we see in the Moon's Body<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot"><BIBL><HI>Loco supra citato.</HI></BIBL></NOTE>."</Q> These
Passages, compared with what hath here been delivered on the <HI>savage
Song-Feasts,</HI> unveil the true Origin of the old <HI>poetic Oracles</HI>
of GREECE. Hence it appears why the God's Vicegerent was a <HI>Woman:</HI> For
his own <HI>Sister</HI> first assumed that Office, and was naturally
succeeded by one of <PB N="62" REF="61"/> <HI>her own Sex.</HI> And the whole
Account of her <HI>Self-Celebra∣tions,</HI> her frantic <HI>Gestures,
Verse,</HI> and <HI>Song,</HI> contains a true Picture of an
<HI>enthusiastic Savage:</HI> For it appears above, 
<Q REND="inline">"that Music, Dance, and Song, are one of the
common Modes of <HI>Divination,</HI> among the savage IROQUOIS<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>See the Passage from LAFITAU.</BIBL></NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P N="9">9. "Their <HI>Melody</HI> was <HI>simple</HI>; and derived a
consider∣able Part of its Power from its <HI>Rythm</HI> or Measure,
with∣out any Mixture of <HI>artificial Composition.</HI>" Much hath been
said on this Subject, in support of the contrary Opi∣nion; and with a View
of proving, that the ancient Melody which wrought such Wonders in GREECE, was
learned, artificial, and complex. With others, an Author no less
considerable than Sir WILLIAM TEMPLE hath concurred in that Opinion<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot"><BIBL><HI>On Poetry,</HI> &amp;c.</BIBL></NOTE>: And all the
Writers on this Subject seem to have given us a Parade of Words without any
determinate Ideas annexed to them. I shall therefore, first, assign the
Reasons why it appears to me, that we have no adequate Idea of the ancient
GREEK Melody; and then, shall collect certain collateral Circum∣stances,
which may prove, that although we are ignorant of its particular Nature, yet
that it was of a <HI>simple</HI> and <HI>in∣artificial</HI>
Construction.</P>
<P>First, with Respect to the three <HI>Genera</HI> or
<HI>Kinds</HI> of the <HI>Greek Melody</HI>; as they are delivered and
interpreted by the Writers on ancient Music, they are incompatible with all
those Intervals and Progressions of Sound which are agree∣able to the
human Ear.</P>
<P>As to the <HI>Enharmonic</HI> Kind, it is confessedly
imprac∣ticable. For it is said to have proceeded by two <HI>Dieses</HI> or 
<PB N="63" REF="62"/> <HI>Quarter-Notes</HI>; (with a stated intermixture of
two whole Tones) an Interval which no human Ear can precisely
dis∣tinguish, nor any human Voice precisely follow. This Fact is so
notorious, and strikes so strongly on the Senses, that the Bigots to
the ancient Melody have generally been silent on it, or at most, have
revered it as a profound My∣stery. The ABBE DU BOS may be regarded as an
Ex∣ception to this general Remark: For He is of Opinion, that the
Progression of the Voice by <HI>Quarter-Notes</HI> might be in general
Use in the theatrical Declamation<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot"><BIBL><HI>Reflex.
Crit. Part.</HI> iii. c. ix.</BIBL></NOTE>. To this it may be sufficient to
reply, that the ABBE confesseth himself ignorant of the Principles of
Music<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Ibid.</BIBL></NOTE>, and that this
Opinion is a Proof of his being so. The Quarter-Note is a Progression
which, although an <HI>Italian</HI> CAS∣TRATO (who hath laboured at this
Refinement through his whole Life) may <HI>nearly</HI> and
<HI>incidentally</HI> accomplish; yet even <HI>He</HI> shall never be able
<HI>strictly</HI> to practise in the <HI>general Course</HI> of his
Performance: But it is a Progression, equally impracticable to the Voice,
and shocking to the Ear of the Generality of Mankind.</P>
<P>The <HI>Chromatic</HI> seems, at first View, to be more
intelligi∣ble; as it is generally said to have proceeded by
<HI>Half-Notes,</HI> of which the human Ear hath an adequate and pre∣cise
Conception. But This too, on a nearer Examination, will be found absolutely at
Variance with that which We stile the <HI>Chromatic</HI>; (though by most
modern Writers it is supposed to be the same) and altogether
in∣compatible with those Progressions of Sound into which a modern Voice
can fall. For the modern <HI>Chromatic</HI> Kind <PB N="62" REF="63"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/> <PB N="63" REF="64"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/> <PB N="64" REF="65"/> is an
<HI>incidental</HI> Ascent or Descent by Half-Notes, with a variable
Intervention of whole Notes, introduced, under certain Restrictions, at the
Composer's Will: But the an∣cient <HI>Chromatic,</HI> as delivered by the
Writers on this Sub∣ject, was an <HI>unvaried</HI> Progression, by two
<HI>Half-Notes,</HI> and a <HI>Third</HI> either <HI>greater</HI> or
<HI>less</HI><NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>See ALYPIUS; at the End of the
<HI>Phaenomena</HI> of ARATUS: To whom I refer for the Truth of these Remarks
on the three <HI>Genera.</HI></BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P>The <HI>Diatonic</HI> Kind, according to the common Concep∣tion of
it, is perfectly understood; and is generally said to be the same with
that, in which our modern Music is com∣monly composed: Yet nothing is
less true than this: For our common Scale is a Progression of whole
Notes, with the Intermixture of two half Notes only, and these at the
Distance of a <HI>fifth</HI> from each other in the <HI>sharp</HI> Key, and
a <HI>fourth</HI> from each other in the <HI>flat</HI> Key: Whereas in the
ancient Diatonic Scale it is quite otherwise: For There, Here, <HI>one
Semitone</HI> and <HI>two whole Tones</HI> are ordained to succeed each other
<HI>invariably:</HI> A Circumstance utterly incompatible with the modern
<HI>Diatonic</HI> Scale.</P>
<P>The Consequence drawn from these Reasonings, is not, that the
Ancients talked or practised absurdly; or that the Moderns want Ears or
Understanding; but only This, that we do not adequately understand the
Terms.</P>
<P>What leads me farther to believe this, is a Circumstance in the
<HI>Spartan</HI> Decree against TIMOTHEUS (given at large below) where it is
said, that he corrupted the <HI>Simplicity</HI> of the <HI>Enharmonic,</HI>
and introduced the <HI>Refinements</HI> of the <HI>Chromatic.</HI> Now this is
an absolute Contradiction to All that we understand concerning the Nature
of these two Kinds. For, as the <HI>Diatonic,</HI> which proceeds by whole 
<PB N="65" REF="66"/> Tones, is more simple than the <HI>Chromatic,</HI> which
proceeds by <HI>Half-Tones</HI>; so This, in its Turn, is more simple than
the <HI>Enharmonic,</HI> which is said to have proceeded by
<HI>Quar∣ter-Tones:</HI> All which is in direct Contradiction to the Tenor of
the <HI>Spartan</HI> Decree.</P>
<P>Secondly, with Regard to the various <HI>Modes</HI> of ancient
Melody, we are often as much in the dark. We read of no less than fifteen,
introduced at different Periods; but the Commentators on the ancient Writers
upon this Sub∣ject, are at Variance with each other, concerning the Na∣ture and
Use of these different Modes. Some are of Opi∣nion, that the Difference lay
in the Degree of <HI>Gravity</HI> or <HI>Acuteness</HI> only: Others
maintain, that the Mode signified the <HI>Rythm,</HI> or <HI>Measure:</HI>
Others again, that the Essence of the <HI>Mode</HI> consisted in a
<HI>different Species</HI> of <HI>Diapason.</HI> There is Reason to
believe, that the Word was used at va∣rious Times, and by different Writers,
in all these Senses, and that each of these Authors may be right in his
Turn. From the Description of an Instrument given by ATHE∣NAEUS it appears,
that by <HI>Mode</HI> was sometimes meant <HI>Gravity</HI> or
<HI>Acuteness</HI> of Sound: For he tells us, that the Musician had three
Lyres placed on a moveable Tripod which turned on an Axis; and that by whirling
it round with his Foot, he could instantly play in three various Modes<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>L. xiv.</BIBL></NOTE>. That <HI>Mode</HI> was sometimes
used for <HI>Measure,</HI> seems evident, because in a Fragment of an
ancient Author cited by ATHENAEUS, we read that a <HI>Hymn</HI> was writ∣ten in
the <HI>Lydian Mode</HI><NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Ibid.</BIBL></NOTE>;
which can only mean, the <HI>Phrygian</HI> or <HI>Dorian Measure.</HI> And as
<HI>Mode</HI> was ap∣plied to Numbers, so was it likewise to
<HI>Dance:</HI> The <HI>Ionici Motus,</HI> which ancient Writers speak of,
are a clear <PB N="66" REF="67"/> Proof of This. That <HI>Mode</HI> was used
in the third of these Acceptations, as a particular <HI>Species</HI> of
<HI>Diapason,</HI> hath been made clear by a late Writer, in a judicious and
accurate Treatise<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>By Sir FR. EYLES
STILES.</BIBL></NOTE>. Thus by the promiscuous Use of the Word Mode,
signifying either <HI>Pitch, Measure,</HI> or <HI>Species</HI> of
<HI>Diapason,</HI> it hath come to pass, that some times the
Signi∣fication of the Word is <HI>clear,</HI> at others it is only
<HI>probable,</HI> often it is <HI>obscure</HI> and <HI>doubtful.</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly, to complete our Ignorance of the particular Nature of their
Melody, the Construction of their Musical Instruments is unknown. We only
know, that the Chords of the Lyre were augmented gradually from <HI>four</HI>
to <HI>forty:</HI> but whether the Strings ascended by Quarter-Notes,
Half-Notes, whole Notes, or by larger Intervals, of all this we know nothing
certain. Our Ignorance of their Pipes or Flutes is not less remarkable.
Commentators and Critics ring Changes on their single, double, oblique,
right-handed, and left-handed Flutes; but what was their precise Make, Tone,
Compass, or Powers, these Gentlemen cannot, with any Certainty, inform us.
The learned ISAAC VOSSIUS is one of the warmest Champions for the Excellence
of an∣cient Instruments: but whoever reads him without Parti∣ality, will find
all his Endeavours amount to no more than what is here affirmed<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot"><BIBL><HI>De Poem. Cantu,</HI> &amp;c.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P>Since, therefore, the particular Nature and Construction of the
ancient Melody is utterly unknown to us; we must have Recourse to
collateral Proofs, drawn from Facts which were connected with this unknown
Melody; and from These we may, I think, indirectly arrive so far at a
Know∣ledge of its <HI>general</HI> Character, as to conclude with Cen∣tainty, 
<PB N="67" REF="68"/> that in the <HI>early</HI> Periods (in which
<HI>Music</HI> boasted its <HI>greatest Power)</HI> the ruling Character
of the <HI>Melody</HI> was that of <HI>Simplicity</HI>; and that it derived a
chief Part of its <HI>Force</HI> from its mere <HI>Rythm</HI> or
<HI>Measure.</HI></P>
<P>Simplicity was its ruling Character; because we find that
<HI>Music</HI> had <HI>then</HI> its greatest Power, when the
<HI>Melody</HI> was most <HI>confined</HI> in its <HI>Compass.</HI> MERCURY
was the In∣ventor of the <HI>Lyre</HI>; which had but <HI>four</HI> Strings,
and these were stretched on a Turtle's Shell<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>PAUSANIAS, l. ix.</BIBL></NOTE>. AM∣PHION was his
Disciple, and increased the Number of Strings to <HI>seven</HI><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Ibid.</BIBL></NOTE>, APOLLO contented himself with
the same Compass of Notes; and so did ORPHEUS<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Ibid.</BIBL></NOTE>. This Number of Strings continued to be
established by Law at SPARTA, so late as the Age of TIMOTHEUS, who
attempted an Innovation of <HI>four</HI> more, and was punished for it<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>See the <HI>Spartan</HI> Decree against TIMOTHEUS, given
at large below.</BIBL></NOTE>. Yet all the mighty Effects and Powers of
<HI>Music,</HI> which we read of in ancient GREECE, arose within this
Period, and while the <HI>Melody</HI> was confined within this small
Compass.</P>
<P>The Lyre, therefore, in its most ancient Forms, being in∣capable
either of a great Variety, or a multifarious Com∣bination of Sounds; a strong
Probability ariseth from its very Nature, that <HI>Counterpoint,</HI> or an
artificial Composition in <HI>various Parts,</HI> was altogether unknown. It
appears to me (from many Passages of ancient Authors compared together, but
too long to insert here) that the Ancients sung and played first in
Unisons, Octaves, and Fifteenths; then in Thirds and Tenths; and in the later
Periods in Fourths and Fifths, as appears from PLUTARCH; though in ARISTOTLE's
Time, it is evident, these last were not <PB N="66" REF="69"/>

practised. It is likewise evident, that in the later Periods, the
<HI>instrumental Accompanyment</HI> was different from the <HI>Song</HI>; yet
this only in the Way of <HI>Division</HI> upon the <HI>fun∣damental
Notes.</HI> Farther than these Methods of <HI>redoubling</HI> or
<HI>dividing</HI> the same Melody, I find nothing like Compo∣sition in
<HI>various Parts.</HI></P>
<P>Oh the contrary, there are many Reasons which may convince us,
that nothing like the modern <HI>Counterpoint</HI> was known to the Ancients.
The Silence of all their Musical Writers collected by MEIBOMIUS, on this
great Article, is a Proof sufficient that they were ignorant of it. Their
Divisions of the musical Art are precise and systema∣tical; and
therefore, if this had made a Part of it, as its Rules must have been more
complex than those of any other Branch, beyond all Doubt, they would have
been distinctly treated of.</P>
<P>The same Consequence seems clearly to arise from a
Passage in ARISTOTLE, who says, that 
<Q REND="inline">"it is much easier to keep the <HI>Time</HI> in
Music, when a Number sing toge∣ther, than when a single Voice only
sings<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot"><BIBL><HI>Probl.</HI> Sect.
xix.</BIBL></NOTE>:"</Q> Which is true, if we suppose a numerous Choir to
sing the same Part, because one Voice tends to correct the Inequalities
of an∣other; but in direct Contradiction to the Truth, if we suppose them
to sing in Counterpoint; because, here, the various Parts have a Tendency
to confound each other.</P>
<P>Their Ignorance of Counterpoint appears farther from hence, that no
Difference is remarked between the Com∣positions for the <HI>Flute</HI> and
those for the <HI>Lyre,</HI> with Respect to the <HI>Multiplicity</HI> of
<HI>Parts.</HI> One Instrument they used, which had two Strings to every
Note, and these two were tuned in <HI>thirds</HI> to each other: This
Instrument was called <PB N="69" REF="72"/> the <HI>Magadis</HI>; and even
this distant Approach towards playing in Counterpoint was regarded as a Thing
so sin∣gular, that to play in <HI>thirds</HI> was called
<GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. If there∣fore any other Kind of
Performance had been used more complex than this, it must have been noted
as a Circum∣stance still more singular.</P>
<P>It appears farther, that in HOMER's Hymn to MER∣CURY, the Poet
represents APOLLO as holding his Lyre in one Hand, and playing with a
<HI>Plectrum</HI> with the other. In an ancient Sculpture which represents
the Deification of HOMER, some of the Figures which dance, are at the same
Time playing on the Lyre, which they hold with one Hand, and strike with the
other. Thus too, when SOPHOCLES played on the Lyre, and at the same Time led
the Dance<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot"><BIBL><HI>Deipnosoph.</HI> l.
i.</BIBL></NOTE>, he must have managed his Instrument in the same Manner.
And again, it appears, that even in the latter Periods, the most celebrated
Lyrists played with <HI>one Plectrum</HI><NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Ibid.
l. xiv.</BIBL> They sometimes touched the String with a <HI>Plectrum,</HI>
sometimes with the <HI>Finger.</HI> But that the Custom of playing with the
<HI>Plectrum</HI> was the more ancient, appears from a curious Fact related by
H. STEPHENS, from PLUTARCH, 
<Q REND="inline">"that <HI>Spartans</HI> punished a Lyrist for
the <HI>Innovation</HI> of playing with his <HI>Finger.</HI>" 
<BIBL>[Thes. Ling. Graec. Voc.
<GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.]</BIBL></Q> VIRGIL introduceth
MUSAEUS, as playing in both these Ways in the <HI>Elyfian</HI> Fields:—<Q REND="inline">"Nunc <HI>Digito,</HI> nunc <HI>Pectine</HI>
pulsat eburno"</Q>—But this proves little more than that <HI>Both</HI>
were in Use in the Time of VIRGIL.—'Tis certain, that on the first
rude Formation of Instruments, the <HI>Plectrum</HI> would give the more
clear and effectual Stroke: As Instruments grew more more delicate, the
<HI>Finger</HI> would come into Use. This (as will appear be∣low, Art. 33.)
explains the Foundation of the <HI>Spartan</HI> Conduct.</NOTE>. Now, all
these Circumstances center in the Proof of this, that the Melody which they
played was <HI>single.</HI></P>
<P>We may farther observe, that their musical <HI>Notation</HI>
(so far as it is supposed to be understood) generally implies a 
<PB N="70" REF="73"/> single, and that a very inartificial Species of
Composition. Nay, the Letters which composed their musical Notation
seem very inadequately to express even a <HI>single</HI> Part, did not
the <HI>Measure</HI> of the <HI>Verse</HI> in some Degree fix that of the
<HI>Melody.</HI></P>
<P>Add to all these Arguments this farther Confirmation, that their
Poets (who were generally at the same Time Warriours, Priests, or
Statesmen) not only composed the Melody to their own Verses, but, in the
early Periods, played and sung them at their Festivals: And that People of
all Ages and Degrees were commonly able to bear a Part in the Chorus, both in
public and private Entertainments. All these concurrent Circumstances
center in one sufficient and satisfactory Proof, that their Melody was not
only <HI>single,</HI> but of the most <HI>simple Construction.</HI></P>
<P>One Kind of <HI>Addition</HI> did undoubtedly in many Instances
take Place: I mean that of the <HI>Tympanum,</HI> the <HI>Sistrum,</HI> or
the <HI>Cymbal</HI> added as an unvaried <HI>Groundwork,</HI> and accom∣modated
to the Measure of the <HI>ruling Melody:</HI> But this was no more than the
modern <HI>Drum</HI> added to the <HI>Fife</HI> or <HI>Trumpet,</HI> the
<HI>Tabor</HI> to the <HI>Pipe,</HI> or the <HI>Drone</HI> to the
<HI>Bag∣pipe:</HI> A Kind of Addition which we find in the Music of almost
every barbarous Country.</P>
<P>Since therefore it appears, that the Force of the ancient
<HI>Greek</HI> Melody consisted neither in its <HI>Compass,</HI> its
<HI>Multi∣solicity</HI> of <HI>Parts,</HI> nor its <HI>artificial</HI>
Construction; let us now proceed to consider the only Circumstance from
which its chief Power could arise, I mean, its <HI>Rythm</HI> or
<HI>Measure.</HI> That this was its real Source, may be evident from the
following Considerations.</P>
<P>First, The <HI>Greek</HI> Language was admirably fitted for a
various and powerful <HI>Rythm</HI> or <HI>Measure,</HI> by its Variety of 
<PB N="71" REF="74"/> <HI>Feet</HI>; which, when thrown into all their different
Combi∣nations, formed such a Variety of <HI>Numbers,</HI> as gave Room for an
equal and correspondent Variety of <HI>Measure</HI> in the annexed
<HI>Melody,</HI> beyond any other Language in the known World. When, therefore,
such a Language offered itself as an Assistant to the Musician's
Art, it was altogether natu∣ral that he should accommodate his Melody to the
peculiar and happy Genius of his Native Tongue.</P>
<P>Secondly, such a Melody as this, marked by strong Changes and
Varieties of Measure, must have greater Ef∣fects than the most
extensive or most artificial Melody when unassisted by it. This
argument is well pursued by the learned ISAAC VOSSIUS: I shall therefore
give it in his own Words; the rather, because it is the most judicious and
philosophic Passage in his whole Work; and contains as it were the
<HI>Kernel</HI> of a large Tract; a considerable Part of which, it must be
owned, may justly be thrown aside as <HI>Husk</HI> and
<HI>Shell.</HI></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">"Wherefore, I cannot enough wonder at those who in
the present and past Age have written on Music; that while they
diligently explained other Things, they should either have said nothing on
<HI>Rythm,</HI> or else written in such a Manner, as to prove themselves
ignorant of its Nature. They confine themselves entirely to
<HI>Counter-point,</HI> neglecting that which is principal in Melody.—For certainly, as neither an <HI>Unit</HI> can produce <HI>Number,</HI> nor a
<HI>single Word</HI> make <HI>Sense</HI>; so neither can any <HI>single
Sound,</HI> separately considered, have any <HI>Power:</HI> Or if it hath,
it must be very inconsiderable. For what Effect in moving the Passions
can arise from the Collision of Stones or Wood, or even from the striking
of one String, <PB N="72" REF="75"/> if <HI>Numbers</HI> and <HI>Rythm</HI> be
wanting, and we hear nothing but a mere Sound<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">The
learned Writer is mistaken in this Paragraph. The mere Sound of
<HI>Thunder</HI> excites <HI>Fear</HI>; other Sounds excite <HI>Sorrow</HI>;
others <HI>Joy.</HI> See the next Article.</NOTE>? Or if we compound various
Sounds, and these be even harmonic and concordant, not even This will produce
any Effect. Such an Harmony of Sounds may please the Ear; but the Pleasure
will only be such, as if Words were (agreeably) spoken, which are either
unmeaning or not understood. That the Soul may be affected, it is
necessary that the Sound should imply, or bring before us, something
which we can comprehend. That Sounds, therefore, may have their full Effect,
the Melody must be animated by such Move∣ments, as contain in themselves
the <HI>Representations</HI> or <HI>Images</HI> of those Things which we
mean to <HI>express</HI> or <HI>imitate</HI> by Song: And This if we can do,
we may be sure to command the Passions of the Soul. But that we may
indeed catch and call forth these <HI>Images,</HI> we must employ that
Variety of Musical <HI>Feet,</HI> in which are so fully contained all the
several Kinds of Movements, that no Affection can be conceived, which they do
not most exactly express. For the Expression of light and voluble
Motions, as of the Dances of <HI>Satyrs,</HI> the <HI>Pyrrichius</HI> and
<HI>Tribrachys</HI> are proper: The <HI>grave</HI> and <HI>slow</HI> are
expressed by the <HI>Spondee</HI> and <HI>Molossus:</HI> Whatever is
<HI>soft</HI> and <HI>tender,</HI> the <HI>Trochee,</HI> and sometimes the
<HI>Amphibrachys</HI> will de∣scribe, which itself moves with a broken and
effeminate Pace. The <HI>Iambic</HI> is fierce and <HI>vehement</HI>; and the
<HI>Anapaest</HI> nearly of the same Nature, as it imitates violent and
warlike Motions. If we mean to express what is <HI>chearful</HI> and
<HI>joyous,</HI> we must employ the <HI>Dactyl,</HI> whose 
<PB N="73" REF="76"/> Movements are of a correspondent Nature. Whatever is
<HI>hard</HI> and <HI>rugged,</HI> the <HI>Antispast</HI> will happily
describe. If we require Numbers that may express <HI>Fury</HI> and
<HI>Mad∣ness,</HI> not only the <HI>Anapaest</HI> is at Hand, but, what is
still more powerful, the <HI>Paeon quartus.</HI>—Of these various
Measures, artificially combined, did the ancient <HI>Greek</HI> and
<HI>Roman</HI> Music consist: And while this flourished, so long did
Music maintain its Empire over the Passions<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>VOSSIUS <HI>de Poem. Cantu et Viribus Rythmi,</HI> p.
72.</BIBL></NOTE>".</Q> Thus the learned VOSSIUS: Whose Admiration of the
Rythm of the ancient Melody leads him into some false Conclusions, as
will appear below. In the mean Time, this general Exhibition of the Genius of
the Greek <HI>Numbers</HI> may stand as a farther accumulative Proof, that
the Power of the ancient <HI>Melody,</HI> which was universally accommo∣dated
to this <HI>Variety</HI> of <HI>expressive Numbers,</HI> lay chiefly in its
<HI>Rythm</HI> or <HI>Measure.</HI></P>
<P>Lastly, these Arguments are much confirmed by the ex∣press
Testimony of PLUTARCH; who, speaking of the Variations which the Genius of
ancient Music had under∣gone in the Progress of Time, says, 
<Q REND="inline">"If we compare An∣tiquity with the present Times,
we shall find, that in ancient Days, there was a great Variety
<HI>Measure,</HI> and this Variety often employed. For in that early Period,
the Variety of <HI>Feet</HI> and <HI>Time</HI> was more highly esteemed:
<HI>We</HI> now study and attend to Variety of <HI>Modes,</HI> the
<HI>An∣cients</HI> to Variety of <HI>Rythm</HI> or <HI>Measure</HI><NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot"><BIBL><HI>De Musica.</HI></BIBL></NOTE>."</Q> This Change
he regards as one of the Corruptions of Melody; he gives an Account of the
Inventors of the several <HI>new Modes,</HI> MELANIPPIDES, PHILOXENUS,
TIMOTHEUS, and others; and insists, that the Art, which formerly had such
Power in <PB N="74" REF="77"/> the Education of Youth, was now sunk into a
mere Amuse∣ment of the Theatre<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>De
Musica.</BIBL></NOTE>. A clear and full Indication, that the ancient
<HI>Greeks</HI> relied on <HI>Measure</HI> or <HI>Rythm</HI> for the
<HI>Force</HI> of their <HI>Melody</HI>; and that as it grew <HI>more
arti∣ficial,</HI> it grew <HI>less powerful.</HI> These Facts fully
coincide with the Reasons given above, on which this Article is founded; 
<Q REND="inline">"Because a Simplicity of Melody, whose Power
arose from mere Rythm or Measure, was most suited to the Powers of the
first barbarous Legislators or Bards, as well as to the Capacity of the
surrounding People."</Q></P>
<P N="10">10. "The Force of this simple Melody was much in∣creased
by the Power of <HI>early Association</HI> and <HI>continued Habit.</HI>
For This, by appropriating certain Sounds to certain Subjects, raised their
Melody into a Kind of natural and expressive Language of the
Passions."—In the first rude Essays towards an expressive
Melody in bar∣barous Countries, certain imperfect Modes of Sound must of
Course be applied, as being expressive of certain Subjects, or
Passions. The succeeding Generation will be naturally bred up to a like
Application of the same Sounds. Hence these Modes of Melody, though
<HI>imperfect</HI> in Expression, being impressed on <HI>infant
Minds</HI> with all the Force of an early Application, must acquire a Power
over <HI>These,</HI> which unaccustomed Minds can never feel. Thus certain
Sounds being appropriated by Use, and having become the com∣mon Indications
of Grief, Terror, Joy, Pity, Rage, or any other Passion, will naturally
excite their respective Affections among those who have adopted them; while
a Hearer from another Country, whose Associations and Habits are
different, will be <HI>little,</HI> or, if at all, perhaps very 
<PB N="75" REF="78"/> <HI>differently</HI> affected by them. LAFITAU's Account
of the Music of the <HI>Iroquois</HI> is a clear Confirmation of this Truth: 
<Q REND="inline">"The Music and Dance of the Americans have
something in them extremely <HI>barbarous,</HI> which at first
<HI>disgusts:</HI> We grow <HI>reconciled</HI> to them <HI>by Degrees,</HI>
and in the <HI>End</HI> partake of them with <HI>Pleasure.</HI> As to the
Savages themselves, they are <HI>fond</HI> of them even to
<HI>Distraction</HI><NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>See above, Sect.
ii.</BIBL></NOTE>."</Q> What we are told of the <HI>Swiss</HI> Song gives
additional Con∣firmation to this Principle. This Song, which to foreign Ears is
uncouth and barbarous, hath such an Effect on the Natives of SWITZERLAND,
among whom it is generally taught and impressed on the infant Mind, that it
is forbid to be sung among their Regiments hired in the Service of other
Nations, lest it should tempt them to desert, and re∣turn to their own
Country. The <HI>Jews, Chinese, Germans, French, Italians,</HI> have all
some peculiar Appropriations of a similar Nature, which gives their native
Music a general Power, which no other Music can ever obtain. Among
ourselves, the Sound of <HI>Bells, Drums, Organs, Trumpets,</HI> have all an
Appropriation of the same Nature: And a Highlander has the same
<HI>warlike</HI> Ideas annexed to the Sound of a <HI>Bagpipe</HI> (an
Instrument which an <HI>Englishman</HI> derides) as the
<HI>Englishman</HI> has to that of a <HI>Trumpet</HI> or a <HI>Fife.</HI>
MELODY therefore is to be considered as a <HI>relative</HI> thing, founded in
the particular Associations and Habits of each People; and by Custom
(like Language) annexed to their Sentiments and Passions: Thus it becomes
the natural Vehicle of these Sentiments and Passions; but a Vehicle,
which can never extend farther than to Those, upon whom such particular
Impressions have been made. This, added to the Power of <HI>Rythm,</HI>
affords a natural Solution to the <PB N="76" REF="79"/> Difficulties raised
concerning the Power of the <HI>Greek</HI> Melody: For as it was taught and
impressed on the infant Mind by early and continued Application (as will
imme∣diately appear) so it naturally acquired the Power of a
<HI>Language</HI> of the <HI>Passions,</HI> which with Respect to other
Nations, if it now existed, it would not possess.</P>
<P>There is a collateral Argument often urged in Favour of the
artificial Excellence of the ancient <HI>Greek Melody</HI>; and drawn from what
we know of the Elegance and Perfection of ancient <HI>Greek Sculpture.</HI> But
the Weakness of this Argument will appear from the Principles here given; the
Effects of the two Arts being by no means <HI>parallel,</HI> but rather
contrary to each other. The <HI>Excellence</HI> of <HI>Sculp∣ture</HI> is the
Effect of repeated Experience, which refers itself to the Works of Nature, as
to its Archetype: And the Pleasure arising from the Contemplation of this
Art consists in seeing the Perfection of the Imitation; and is the
Result of a fine Taste, founded on a correct Judgment. But the
<HI>Force</HI> of <HI>Melody</HI> on the Passions depends not on its
artificial Construction or Elegance, but solely on its being adapted to the
Feelings, Passions, and Conceptions of the Hearer, be they just or
false, polished or barbarous. Hence we shall find, that the
<HI>Force</HI> of the two Arts will be generally in an <HI>inverse
Proportion.</HI> For the <HI>Attention</HI> to <HI>Sculpture,</HI> being
founded on a <HI>reflex Act</HI> of the Under∣standing, will always
increase with increasing Taste and Knowledge: But the <HI>Power</HI> of
<HI>Melody,</HI> being founded in <HI>Passion,</HI> will <HI>there</HI> be
most general and strong, where Fear, Joy, Wonder, Terror, and
Astonishment, are most easily and most frequently excited: And it is
certain, these natu∣ral Passions are not so common in a State highly
polished, as in that of Barbarity or simple Civilization. 'Tis granted 
<PB N="77" REF="80"/> indeed, nay insisted on, that the ancient Melody grew
more artificial in the later Periods: But the same Authors who inform us of
this<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>ARISTOTLE, PLUTARCH, and
others.</BIBL></NOTE>, assure us that its Power was greatest in the early
and barbarous Times; that this Power continued longest in that Society which
continued longest in Barbarity, I mean the Commonwealth of SPARTA; and that
as it grew more artificial, it degenerated every where into a mere Amusement,
and lost its Influence on the Passions and the Mind.</P>
<P N="11">11. "Their <HI>Songs</HI> were of a <HI>legislative</HI>
Cast; and being drawn chiefly from the Fables or History of their own
Country, contained the essential Parts of their <HI>religious,
political,</HI> and <HI>moral</HI> Systems." We have seen above, that the
Celebration of their deceased Heroes became naturally a <HI>religious
Act:</HI> That the <HI>Maxims</HI> or <HI>Exhortations</HI> inter∣mixed with
these, and founded on the Example of their Heroe-Gods, became of Course the
<HI>Standard</HI> of <HI>Right</HI> and <HI>Wrong,</HI> that is, the Foundation
of <HI>private Morals</HI> and of <HI>public Law</HI>; and thus the whole
Fabric of their <HI>Religion, Morals,</HI> and <HI>Polity,</HI> arose
naturally from their <HI>Song-Feasts,</HI> in their Progress from
<HI>savage</HI> to <HI>civilized</HI> Life.</P>
<P>The Records that remain concerning the <HI>Bards</HI> of an∣cient
GREECE unite in confirming this Principle. Of this illustrious Catalogue,
LINUS was perhaps the first: He writ the Exploits of the first BACCHUS; and
sung the Generation of the World and the Rise of Things<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>DIODORUS, l. iii. and LAERTIUS.</BIBL></NOTE>. PAMPHO is
supposed to have been his Disciple: And He composed <HI>Hymns</HI> in
Honour of the Gods; and sung the Rape of PROSERPINE by PLUTO<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>PAUSANIAS <HI>in Baeoticis.</HI></BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="81"/>The next great poetic and musical Sage was
ORPHEUS: He is said to have sung of <HI>Chaos</HI> and <HI>Creation</HI>;
and a Variety of other Subjects <HI>religious</HI> and
<HI>philosophical</HI><NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>SUIDAS <HI>in
Orpheo.</HI></BIBL></NOTE>. Some fine Fragments remain under his Name; but
there is Reason, from some internal Marks in the Composition, to believe
them spurious.</P>
<P>MUSAEUS is said to have been the Disciple of ORPHEUS: He, too,
writ <HI>Hymns</HI> and <HI>Prophecies,</HI> and sung the Motions of the
<HI>Stars,</HI> and the Battles of the <HI>Giants</HI><NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>LAERTIUS <HI>in Proaem.</HI></BIBL></NOTE>. THAMYRIS was not
less distinguished by the <HI>legislative</HI> Genius of his Songs: For
he was not only the Author of a <HI>Titan's War</HI>; but celebrated the Gods
in <HI>Hymns,</HI> and sung the <HI>Generation</HI> of the
<HI>World</HI><NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>SUIDAS <HI>in
Tham.</HI></BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P>These are the most celebrated <HI>Bards</HI> of ancient GREECE,
whose Songs have perished in the Wreck of Time. If we come down to the
most famous of those, whose Writ∣ings have been preserved, we shall
find their Songs com∣posed in the same <HI>legislative</HI> Style and
Genius.</P>
<P>HESIOD seems to stand at the Head of these, in the Order of
Time. And his <HI>Theogony</HI> is a living Witness how far HIS
<HI>legislative</HI> Turn accords to the Principles here deliver∣ed. He
gives, in Form, the <HI>Generation</HI> of all the <HI>Gods</HI> of GREECE; and
mixeth his Narration with their <HI>Acts</HI> and <HI>Praises.</HI></P>
<P>HOMER appears next in the Order of Time: And in his unrivaled Songs
we find the <HI>Religion, Polities,</HI> and <HI>Manners</HI> of ancient GREECE
displayed with all the Ap∣pearances of Truth, because delivered with all
their <HI>Imper∣fections.</HI> During the early Periods of Civilization, the 
<PB N="79" REF="82"/> <HI>legislative</HI> Art is always of an
<HI>imperfect</HI> Form. In the rude Progress of barbarous Manners, the
<HI>moral</HI> Ideas are <HI>confined,</HI> and little distinguished. If
the People be fierce and war∣like (as were the Tribes of GREECE) Strength,
Courage, Agility, and Cunning, are the ruling Virtues. Hence it follows, that
the Pictures both of <HI>Gods</HI> and <HI>Men</HI> will ac∣cord to this
Principle in such a Period: And hence many of the Fables of HOMER himself
were of a Cast so different from the Spirit of <HI>improved
Legislation,</HI> that PLATO re∣fused them Admittance into his
Republic<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot"><BIBL><HI>De Rep.</HI> l. ii,
iii.</BIBL>—It is generally affirmed and believed, that PLATO was for
banishing Poetry, without Exception, from his perfect Republic. So far is
this from being true, that he affirms directly, 
<Q REND="inline">"that he only means to banish That which is
pernicious; but to retain That which is useful." 
<BIBL>[<HI>De Rep.</HI> l. x.]</BIBL></Q> Nay, he hath written a
whole Book 
<BIBL>[<HI>De Leg.</HI> l. ii.]</BIBL> to prove the Utility of
<HI>Music</HI> in the Education of Youth: Through the Course of which, if
is evident, that in His Idea, <HI>Poetry</HI> makes the most essential
Part of <HI>Music.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>And here, while we acknowledge HOMER as the supreme Painter of
natural Manners, and of a Genius truly <HI>legislative</HI> according to the
Principles of his Time; critical Justice de∣mands, that we take off some of
those false Colourings of Praise, which both Ancients and Moderns have
lavished on him, in Regard to the Excellence of the <HI>Morals</HI> which he
taught. HORACE, it is well known, hath set him above the old Philosophers,
as a Teacher of all Virtue<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot"> 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>Qui quid pulchrum,</HI> &amp;c.</Q></NOTE>.
PLUTARCH, in his Life of HOMER, hath advanced the same Positions: But
whoever will examine his Poems with an impartial Eye, will find a very
deficient Plan of Morals prevailing through them. There is not the least
Vestige or Appearance of those abstract general Principles of moral
Excellence or Blame, which take Place in the more refined <PB N="80" REF="83"/>
Periods of social and polished Life: His Gods and Heroes fight and plunder,
kill and ravish, boast and lye; are generous, fierce, prodigal, rapacious,
cruel, or unrelenting, without much Controul from <HI>moral Ideas</HI> within,
or from a <HI>refined legislative Art</HI> without.</P>
<P>It is remarkable that PLUTARCH, after labouring in vain through many
Pages, to prove that the Principles of all the Virtues are to be found in
HOMER, is forced at length to conclude; 
<Q REND="inline">"It is true, indeed, that <HI>bad</HI> Actions and
Principles are intermixed and described in the same Manner; which was
necessary, for the Introduction of the Sublime and Wonderful: But this only
makes the Contrast the stronger; so that the Reader is necessarily
led to <HI>select</HI> the <HI>Good,</HI> and <HI>reject</HI> the
<HI>Bad</HI><NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot"><BIBL><HI>In Vita</HI>
HOMERI.</BIBL></NOTE>."</Q> But as this great Ancient, along with others, allow
that neither the <HI>good</HI> nor the <HI>bad</HI> is actually recommended by
the Poet; the Consequence follows, that the Reader (if so disposed) may
as easily <HI>elect</HI> the <HI>bad,</HI> and <HI>reject</HI> the
<HI>good:</HI> That HO∣MER was a compleat <HI>natural Painter</HI> of the Ways
of Men; but an imperfect moral Painter from the <HI>unpolished Genius</HI>
and <HI>barbarous Legislation</HI> of the Age in which he lived.</P>
<P>The Inconsistency of a late learned Writer on this Sub∣ject is
too glaring to pass unnoticed. He justly criticiseth VIRGIL, as being
shackled by the refined Manners of his Times, and the political Forms of his
Country. With equal Truth he displays the free Vein of Nature, which runs
through HOMER's Poems. 
<Q REND="inline">"The natural <HI>Greek,</HI> in HOMER's Days,

Wine: He told how voraciously he eat when he was hungry; and how

<HI>comfortless.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="85"/>In all this, the Poet is not blameable: He
painted what he saw, and believed, and painted truly. The Fault lay in the
Opinions and Manners of the Times: In the Defects of an early and barbarous
Legislation, which had but half-civilized Mankind.</P>
<P>Our great <HI>Translator</HI> of HOMER hath often departed from
the Character of his Original in this Respect: He hath frequently thrown in
fine <HI>moral</HI> Traits, of which there is not the least Footstep in his
<HI>Author.</HI> By this, in∣deed, he hath given us a Poem more accommodated to
the Taste of our own Times; but hath lost the native and un∣polished
Simplicity which distinguishes the venerable old Prince of <HI>Epic
Song.</HI></P>
<P>The next great <HI>legislative Bard</HI> whom I shall now
men∣tion, was PINDAR. At the Period when He flourished, the Fortune and Glory
of GREECE were rising to their Meridian: The <HI>legislative</HI> Arts had
now obtained a higher Degree of <HI>Perfection:</HI> And accordingly we find,
in his sublime <HI>Songs,</HI> the fullest and most perfect Union of
salutary Principles, thrown out in Maxims religious, political, and moral. No
Vices or Imperfections, either of Gods or Men, are there applauded or
palliated; nor ever recited, but to be condemned: All Actions are praised or
censured, according to their Influence on the public Happiness. The Intent
of these <HI>Songs,</HI> sung by their Author at their most ge∣neral and
renowned Festivals, was to inspire his Countrymen with the Love of Glory
and of Virtue. To this great End, he animated them, not only by the Example and
Praise of the Victors in the <HI>Olympic Games</HI>; but ascended into
past Times, and drew from thence the shining Acts of Gods and Heroes, who
had distinguished themselves by Valour, Arts, or Virtues.</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="86"/>And here, in Justice to this great Poet we
must observe, that PINDAR's Songs, considered in this
<HI>legislative</HI> View, afford an easy and internal Solution of a
Difficulty which hath at all Times embarrassed his Commentators and
Cri∣tics; who have ever censured his seeming Irregularities and sudden
Flights, from the <HI>declared Heroe</HI> of his Poem, to <HI>Gods</HI> and
<HI>deceased Chieftains.</HI> But on the Principle here given, it appears,
that the Heroe of the Day was but the <HI>occasional</HI> and
<HI>incidental</HI> Subject of his Ode. The main Intent was the Praise of his
Country's Gods and Heroes, who had signalized themselves by Actions
beneficent and great. When therefore he seems to <HI>wander</HI> into the
Cele∣bration of <HI>their</HI> Names, he is indeed <HI>severely true</HI> to
the <HI>leading Subject</HI> of his <HI>Song.</HI></P>
<P>The very Objection itself, as it is urged by some of PINDAR's
Critics, leads us to the Solution here given. A French Writer thus
expresseth it. 
<Q REND="inline">"He is not always content with praising the
<HI>Country</HI> of his <HI>Heroe</HI>; he pro∣ceeds to celebrate the <HI>great
Men</HI> which it had <HI>produced,</HI> and then it is that he <HI>wanders
indeed.</HI> So when his <HI>Heroe</HI> is of EGINA, after having celebrated
the Isle in <HI>general,</HI> he descends to <HI>particulars,</HI> and
praiseth AEACUS, PE∣LEUS, TELAMON, ACHILLES, and NEOPTOLEMUS, AJAX and
TEUCER, who all <HI>sprung</HI> from <HI>thence:</HI> He mentions CYPRUS,
SALAMINE, PHTHIA, EPIRUS, which were <HI>Colonies founded by these

Illustration of the <HI>Solution</HI> here given, than this very
<HI>Objection</HI> thus presented at large.</P>
<P>There is a fabulous Story told, which strongly confirms the
Principle here delivered; and proves it to have been <PB N="84" REF="87"/> the
Opinion of ancient GREECE, that a Part of these festal Celebrations was due
to the Gods and Heroes; and that it was even a <HI>Crime</HI> to <HI>omit</HI>
their Praises. 
<Q REND="inline">"The Poet SIMO∣NIDES, having agreed with an
<HI>Olympic Victor,</HI> called SCOPAS, for an Ode of Celebration; SIMONIDES,
ac∣cording to Custom, went largely into the Praise of CASTOR and POLLUX. On

he must apply to CASTOR and POLLUX for the Remainder. SCOPAS being afterwards
at a Banquet with SIMONIDES, Word was brought, that <HI>two Men</HI> covered
with Sweat and Dust were at the Door, and desired to speak with
SIMONIDES: He went out of the Chamber, and imme∣diately the Roof fell in, and

<P>The three <HI>Greek</HI> TRAGEDIANS are the last of this
il∣lustrious Catalogue of legislative Bards: And their Writ∣ings, though
very different in their Style and Manner, yet all unite in holding forth the
leading Principles of the Greek Religion, Polity, and Morals.</P>
<P>ESCHYLUS, who stands first in Order of Time, partakes much of
the rude Genius of the early Periods. His Imagery and Sentiments are great; his
Style rugged and abrupt; and of a Cast so totally different from that of
HOMER, that it is astonishing to hear the Critics, one after another,
affirming that HOMER was his Model<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>See this Point
considered below, Art. 20.</BIBL></NOTE>. His Writings present to us all
the Characters of a sublime, original, and uncultivated Genius, which
scorned any other Tutoress than <HI>Nature.</HI> He was Himself a great
Warriours; <PB N="85" REF="88"/> and his warlike Genius threw itself out, in
Subjects that were grand and terrible. Hence his Tragic Songs abound with the
most gloomy and tremendous Exploits of the Gre∣cian Heroes, striking the
Soul with Admiration, Astonish∣ment, and Terror.</P>
<P>SOPHOCLES appeared next; of a more sedate and tem∣pered Majesty:
He improved on ESCHYLUS both in <HI>Plan</HI> and <HI>Morals.</HI> For the
<HI>legislative Arts</HI> were now advancing at ATHENS with great Rapidity.
No Wonder, therefore, that the Disciple conquered his Master; when he had
the improving Sense of his Country to elevate and inlarge his Genius. But
still the Gods and Heroes of GREECE were the constant Subject of his
Song.</P>
<P>EURIPIDES, considered in the legislative View, was on a Level
with his Masters with Respect to the Subject of his Tragedies (for these
were always drawn from the <HI>Grecian Gods</HI> or <HI>Heroes)</HI> but
possessed himself of the Advantage which the still improving State
of his Country gave him. For <HI>Philosophy</HI> was now in its Ascendant:
The <HI>Poet</HI> was the <HI>Disciple</HI> of an eminent <HI>Sage:</HI>
Hence the Genius of EURIPIDES carried the legislative Power of Song to its
last Perfection; and threw itself out, in such a Variety of Maxims,
<HI>political</HI> and <HI>moral,</HI> as far outwent the Art of his
Predecessors.</P>
<P>Such then, through the various Ages of ancient GREECE, was the
legislative Genius of their <HI>Songs</HI>; which, in their several
Periods, contained the leading Principles of their <HI>Re∣ligion, Morals,</HI>
and <HI>Polity</HI>; and thus became the natural and proper Object of the
public Attention and Regard.</P>
<P N="12"><PB N="86" REF="89"/>12. "MUSIC, in its more extensive
Meaning, that is, in∣cluding <HI>Melody</HI> and the <HI>Song</HI><NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>See above, Art. 1.</BIBL></NOTE>, either with or without the
<HI>Dance</HI>" (for this last, as will appear below<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>See Art. 15.</BIBL></NOTE>, was soon separated from the
other two, for an important End) "bore a principal and essential Part in
the Education of their Children." The Authorities which prove this, are
abundant, and even superfluous. Some of the principal may suffice. 
<Q REND="inline">"Among the Ancients" (says the wise PLUTARCH)
"Music in Theatres was not known: They employed all their Art in the
Worship of the Gods, and the Education of their Youth<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>PLUT. <HI>de Musica.</HI></BIBL></NOTE>."</Q> The same
Author gives several Instances of musical Education in CRETE and SPARTA;
and tells us, that 
<Q REND="inline">"By Music the young Men were taught to
<HI>abstain</HI> from every thing <HI>indecent</HI> in <HI>Word</HI> and
<HI>Deed</HI>; and to observe <HI>Decorum, Temperance,</HI> and
Regularity<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Ibid.</BIBL></NOTE>."</Q> Again: 
<Q REND="inline">"Music was the Foun∣dation of a virtuous
Education; because it was allied with <HI>Philosophy, Morals,</HI> and
<HI>Heroism:</HI> ACHILLES was taught by CHIRON, and played and sung the
<HI>great Actions</HI> of <HI>Heroes</HI><NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Ibid.</BIBL></NOTE>."</Q> Elsewhere he informs us, that 
<Q REND="inline">"the <HI>Spartans</HI> in their <HI>Songs</HI>
talked high of what <HI>Exploits</HI> they had performed: And that the
<HI>young Men</HI> echoed back their <HI>Triumphs</HI> in their Songs,
proclaiming their Reso∣lution to <HI>equal</HI> the Valour of their
<HI>Forefathers</HI><NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>In
Lycurgo.</BIBL></NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>Such was the Nature of ancient <HI>Music</HI> when applied to
Education; and not a mere Proficiency in the <HI>playing</HI> or
<HI>singing</HI> Art, as it hath been generally misunderstood, and
ignorantly ridiculed by many Moderns. Hence it was, <PB N="87" REF="90"/> that
their greatest Captains and Statesmen studied Music, as an
essential Part of Education. Thus PERICLES was taught by DAMON, who was
likewise supposed to have in∣structed him in Politics<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>PLUT. <HI>in Pericle.</HI></BIBL></NOTE>. Thus EPAMINONDAS
was eminent in Music; though the <HI>Roman</HI> Historian<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>CORN. <HI>Nepos in Praefat. Vit.</HI>
EPAMINOND.</BIBL></NOTE>, who informs us of the Fact, speaks like one who
knew not the Nature and Extent of Music among the earlier Greeks.</P>
<P>PLATO confirms these Authorities; and recites more at large the
particular Method of Education used in ancient GREECE. 
<Q REND="inline">"What then is the most proper Discipline? Will
it not be difficult to find a better, than what was long ago established?
One Part of this is the <HI>Gymnastic,</HI> which relates to the
<HI>Body</HI>; the other is <HI>Music,</HI> which relates to the
<HI>Mind.</HI> This Discipline ought first to be∣gin with <HI>Music</HI>;
and when we speak of <HI>Music,</HI> we in∣clude the <HI>Subject,
Words,</HI> or <HI>Song.</HI> Of this there are two Kinds, the <HI>true</HI>
and <HI>fabulous.</HI> Both ought to be ap∣plied; but the fabulous first. Yet
the <HI>Fables</HI> ought to be <HI>regulated</HI> lest the young Mind being
tinctured with such as are improper, it should be necessary at a more
adult Age to counterwork the first Impressions<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot"><BIBL><HI>De Repub.</HI> l. ii.</BIBL></NOTE>."</Q> He then
proceeds to a particular Detail of Fables proper and improper in the Work of
Education, pointing out what ought to be admitted or rejected. In another
Dialogue, he speaks again of the Remains of this Method of Instruction,
which were found among the wiser Sort, even in his own Times; although in
general (as will appear below<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Art. 34,
35.</BIBL></NOTE>) <HI>Music</HI> was then totally <HI>corrupted.</HI> 
<Q REND="inline">"The Parents commit their Children to the Care of
Masters; and are more <PB N="88" REF="91"/> sollicitous about their
<HI>Morals,</HI> than their Proficiency in <HI>Learning,</HI> or
<HI>playing</HI> on the <HI>Lyre.</HI> As soon as they have attained a
Knowledge of Letters, and are able to under∣stand what they read, the
Masters give them the Works of the <HI>best Poets</HI> to peruse and get
by Heart, especially such as contain the <HI>Praises</HI> of their
<HI>Forefathers</HI> renowned for <HI>great Actions,</HI> that the Boys may be
fired with an <HI>Emulation</HI> to <HI>imitate</HI> their <HI>Virtues.</HI>
The Music-Masters are above all things careful to give them Habits of
Wis∣dom and Temperance, and to see that they commit no unworthy Action. As
soon as they have learnt to play on the Lyre, the Master proceeds to
instruct them in the <HI>Songs</HI> of the most famous <HI>Poets:</HI>
These they <HI>sing</HI> to the Lyre; and the Preceptors endeavour to bring
their Boys to a Love of the Rythms and Numbers; that by this Discipline they
may be more <HI>mild, modest,</HI> and <HI>orderly</HI> in their
<HI>Manners,</HI> and become <HI>useful</HI> both in <HI>Speech</HI> and
<HI>Action</HI><NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>In

<P>Suitable to this Method of Education is PLATO's Di∣rection in his
Book of Laws. 
<Q REND="inline">"Therefore the Legislator will take Care, that the
Youth's Mind may be so formed, that his <HI>Pleasures</HI> and
<HI>Displeasures</HI> may <HI>accord</HI> to the <HI>Laws,</HI> and to the
Taste of <HI>mature Age:</HI> And if it be necessary, he will compel the
Poet to describe the <HI>Actions</HI> of <HI>brave</HI> and <HI>good</HI>
Men; and to compose such <HI>Numbers</HI> and <HI>Harmonies</HI> as may be
suited to the Subjects<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot"><BIBL><HI>De Legibus,</HI> l.
ii.</BIBL></NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>In the same Place he assigns a particular Reason for this
Method of Education: 
<Q REND="inline">"Because the youthful Mind is not apt to attend to
serious Study, therefore the <HI>pleasing Vehicle</HI> of <HI>Song</HI> is
to be administered<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Ibid.</BIBL></NOTE>."</Q> He
then pro∣ceeds <PB N="89" REF="92" MS="y"/> even to the particular moral Maxims
which ought to be instilled by the Poet and Musician, on the Principles of
a wise Legislator.</P>
<P>As these Authorities are clear and decisive, we may here
properly obviate an Error of the excellent MONTESQUIEU, arising from his
Misapprehension of the true Nature and Extent of ancient Music. He, with
most other Writers, supposeth it to have consisted (according to the
modern Acceptation of the Word) in the single Circumstance of
<HI>Melody.</HI> In Consequence of this, when he comes to in∣quire why the
ancient <HI>Greeks</HI> applied Music so universally in the Education of
their Children, he says, 
<Q REND="inline">"As they were a warlike People, and therefore in
Danger of de∣generating into a savage Ferocity of Manners, they em∣ployed
Music, as the best Means of softening their Tem∣pers into a milder
Character; and this, because Music, of all the Pleasures of Sense, has
the least Tendency to corrupt the Soul<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot"><BIBL><HI>L'Esprit des Loix,</HI> l. iv. c.
8.</BIBL></NOTE>."</Q> And so far, indeed, is true, that the ancient Greeks
did consider this, as one of the salutary Effects arising from the
Application of Music<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>PLATO <HI>de Rep.</HI> l.
iii.</BIBL></NOTE>. But we now find, that the Matter lay much deeper: That
Music, in its ancient Sense, implied not only <HI>Melody</HI> but
<HI>Verse</HI> or <HI>Song:</HI> That it was the <HI>established
Vehicle</HI> of all the leading Principles of their <HI>Religion, Morals,</HI>
and <HI>Polity</HI>; and therefore was the natural and most important
Instru∣ment or Means in the Education of their Children.</P>
<P>The learned DACIER falls into the same Error, with Re∣spect to
the wonderful Efficacy of <HI>Music,</HI> in the <HI>Education</HI> of the
<HI>Arcadians,</HI> and the fatal Want of it among the In∣habitants 
<PB N="90" REF="93"/> habitants of CYNAETHE, as the fact is recorded by
POLY∣BIUS and ATHENAEUS. 
<Q REND="inline">"If (says the Critic) PO∣LYBIUS speaks thus of
<HI>Music,</HI> and if he accuseth EPHORUS of having advanced a thing
unworthy of him, in saying that this Art was invented to deceive Mankind;
what may we not say of <HI>Tragedy,</HI> of which <HI>Music</HI> is but a
<HI>small Ornament,</HI> and which as far surpasseth <HI>Music,</HI>
as <HI>Speech</HI> is beyond inarticulate and <HI>unmeaning Sounds</HI><NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>DACIER <HI>Poët. d' Aristote.
Preface.</HI></BIBL></NOTE>."</Q> In this Passage, the learned Writer
evidently supposeth that the ancient <HI>Music,</HI> which wrought such
Wonders in the Education of the <HI>Arcadians,</HI> was no more than mere
<HI>Melody</HI> or <HI>unmeaning Sound.</HI> But the Account which both
PO∣LYBIUS and ATHENAEUS give of the musical Education of the
<HI>Arcadians,</HI> confirms all that hath been here advanced; and proves, that
it consisted in the Application of the united Powers of <HI>Dance,
Melody,</HI> and <HI>Song.</HI></P>
<P>The most learned VOSSIUS proceeds on the same Mistake in his
first Book <HI>De Natura Artium:</HI> And continues under the Influence of
this fundamental Error, through his whole Dissertation on <HI>Music.</HI>
As it may seem unaccount∣able, how so capital a Mistake should creep
into the Writings of these great Authors, let me here observe, as an
Apology for them all, that ARISTOTLE, and some suc∣ceeding Writers, speak
of <HI>Music</HI> as an Art <HI>distinct</HI> from <HI>Poetry</HI><NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Poët. passim.</BIBL></NOTE>: It was therefore
natural enough for these Writers to draw their Ideas of ancient Music from
the great Master-Critic of GREECE. How it came to pass, that ARISTOTLE
should speak of these Arts as <HI>two,</HI> which the elder Writers
considered as <HI>one,</HI> will clearly appear be∣low <PB N="91" REF="94"/><NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Art. 35.</BIBL></NOTE>; where we
shall see, that in the Time of ARIS∣TOTLE, a Separation of the
<HI>Melody</HI> and <HI>Song</HI> had taken place; that the first retained
the Name of <HI>Music,</HI> and the second assumed that of
<HI>Poetry.</HI></P>
<P N="13">13. "MUSIC, in its inlarged Sense, acquired a
<HI>great</HI> and <HI>general Power</HI> over the Minds and Actions of the
ancient <HI>Greeks.</HI>" It is presumed, that we have now gained an
Ascent, from whence this Truth will appear evident and indisputable; though
it hath long been regarded by many, as an incredible Paradox.—How, or
whence, such an universal Passion for Music should have arisen in
GREECE; or, after it had arisen, how it gained such a general
Esta∣blishment in the important Article of Education; or, after it was thus
established, how it could work such mighty Effects upon the Mind,
supposing it to consist only in mere Melody;—are Questions
which wise Men have asked, and Bigots to Antiquity have weakly answered:
For the common Reply hath been, that their <HI>Music</HI> (meaning their
<HI>Melody)</HI> was of a kind so much superior to ours, that all its
wonderful Effects followed from its more exalted Nature.—On the contrary,
it appears, that as to its par∣ticular Construction, we are ignorant of it:
That we have no precise or practicable Idea of their <HI>Genera,</HI> their
<HI>Modes</HI>; nor the <HI>Make,</HI> nor <HI>Power</HI> of their
<HI>Instruments:</HI> But that by collateral Arguments we can prove, that
their <HI>Melody</HI> was something altogether <HI>simple</HI> and
<HI>inartificial</HI>; such as States∣men, Warriours, and Bards, occupied
in other Pursuits, could compose; and such as high and low, Children and
Men busied in other concerns of Life, could learn and practise. That hence
we are led to believe, that what∣ever <PB N="92" REF="95" MS="y"/> ever Effects
arose from the mere <HI>Melody,</HI> arose from its <HI>Rythm</HI> or
<HI>Measure,</HI> heightened by early <HI>Association</HI> and continued
<HI>Habit</HI>; by which it became a kind of natural <HI>Language</HI> of the
Passions. It appears farther, that <HI>Melody</HI> formed but a
<HI>Part</HI> of the ancient <HI>Music</HI>; and that its most important
and essential Branch was that of <HI>Verse</HI> or <HI>Song.</HI> But for
a clear and full View of the Origin and Union of their <HI>Melody</HI> and
<HI>Song,</HI> it was necessary to go back, and be∣gin our Inquiries at the
early Period of savage Life, in which all the Seeds and Principles of
civilized Society ap∣pear in their native and uncultivated State. This Method
of Investigation hath opened to us an involved and clouded Subject. Hence it
appears, that <HI>Melody, Dance,</HI> and <HI>Song,</HI> naturally arose in
<HI>Union</HI>; that <HI>Measure, Rythm,</HI> and <HI>Num∣bers,</HI> were the
certain Consequence: That in the earliest Times of GREECE, the Characters
of <HI>Legislator</HI> and <HI>Bard</HI> did often and naturally
<HI>coalesce:</HI> That hence their earliest Histories, Laws, and
Oracles, were of course written in Verse; that their religious Rites were
naturally, and with∣out positive Appointment, performed or accompanied by
Melody, Dance, and Song: That through the several im∣proving Periods of Time,
their Songs were more and more of a true legislative Cast; that they
included all the great Actions of their Gods and Heroes, and that in these
were contained the leading Principles of their Religion, Morals, and Polity:
That <HI>Music,</HI> in this its inlarged Sense, bore an essential and
principal Part in the Education of their Children; being the pleasing and
powerful Vehicle, by which all the important Precepts of Life were instilled
into their tender Minds.—Thus naturally <HI>Music</HI> arose, and was
<HI>powerfully established</HI> in ancient GREECE: And from this 
<PB N="93" REF="96"/> View of its Nature and establishment, its <HI>general
Influence</HI> must unavoidably follow: 
<Q REND="inline">"For through the Force of early and continued Habit,
together with the irresistible Contagion of public Example maintained by
the gene∣ral Practice of the whole Community, who had received the same
Impressions in their infant State; and while every thing pleasing, great,
and important, was conveyed through this Medium; such strong
Associations did strike themselves into the Tribes of GREECE, as
natu∣rally produced the most lasting Effects, and such as no future
Incidents of Life could easily weaken or efface."</Q></P>
<P>On these principles we may naturally explain some of the
recorded Effects of ancient Music, which according to the common
Interpretation of the Word, have been liable to the Derision of modern
Critics.</P>
<P>We read, that such was the Power of ancient Music, that when
AGAMEMNON went to TROY, the designing EGIS∣THUS could not debauch
CLITEMNESTRA, till he had decoyed away the <HI>Musician</HI> that was
retained in the Palace. This Account, if we understand by <HI>Music</HI> no
more than <HI>Melody,</HI> hath much the Air of Hyperbole and Fable. But if we
regard the <HI>Musician</HI> as what indeed he was, the Dis∣penser of
<HI>religious</HI> and <HI>moral</HI> Principles, and that he urged the great
Duty of conjugal Fidelity with the united Powers of poetic Eloquence and Song;
and urged them to one whose Education had made her susceptible of such
Im∣pressions, the fabulous Appearances dissolve; and we see, that no
other Method could have been devised, so effectual for the Preservation
of a weak Woman's Virtue.</P>
<P>Again; we are told, that certain young Men heated with Wine, had
agreed to assault the Doors of a modest <PB N="94" REF="97"/> Woman, and
abuse her as a Prostitute: but that an able Musician coming past, he
sung and played to them in the <HI>Dorian</HI> Mode; on which they were
struck with Shame, and desisted from their Enterprize<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">This Story is ridiculed in the <HI>Memoirs</HI> of MARTINUS
SCRIBLERUS: And the Ridicule is founded on an entire Misapprehension, or
Mis∣representation, of the true nature of <HI>ancient</HI> MUSIC.</NOTE>.
This, to modern Comprehension, hath still more the Air of Fable: But when
the Fact is well explained, the Ridicule vanisheth with the Mystery. For
every <HI>different Subject</HI> had a <HI>diffe∣rent Mode</HI> annexed to it.
This appears at large from PLATO. 
<Q REND="inline">"You must adapt the Mode to the Subject and Words,
not these to the Mode or Harmony: On these Matters we will farther
deliberate with DAMON, what Feet or Measures are fittest to express
Illiberality, Petu∣lance, frantic Folly, and other Vices; and what Measures
best express their contrary Virtues. <HI>Hence</HI> it is, that Rythm and
Numbers gain their Power in the musical Edu∣cation, and exercise their

therefore, that when the Historian tells us, that the Musician conquered
the young Debauchees by an Application of the <HI>Dorian</HI> Mode, he means to
signify, that the Melody was accompanied by a <HI>poetic Exhortation</HI>
suited to the Numbers; and this could be no other than a Lesson of
<HI>Modesty</HI> and <HI>Temperance</HI>; which being conveyed by the
pleasing Vehicle of Melody and Song, addressed to those who by the
Tenor of their Education must feel its Force, and given by one whose
Pro∣fession they had been taught to reverence, could hardly fail 
<PB N="95" REF="98"/> of its designed Effects, unless their Intemperance had
pre∣vented all Attention.</P>
<P>There are other recorded Effects of ancient Music of a similar
Nature, which it is not necessary to produce here, because they may all
be accounted for on the same Prin∣ciple. With Respect to the traditionary
Influence of this Art on wild Beasts, Stocks, and Stones, as it came down
from the ignorant and fabulous Times, so nothing can be justly concluded
from it, but the Force of Music over the Minds of uninstructed and
wondering Barbarians.</P>
<P>Thus the boasted Power of the ancient <HI>Greek Music</HI>
seems naturally and fully accounted for. And in Confirmation of this
Solution, we may finally appeal to the savage Tribes with whom this Inquiry
began. For by Means parallel in most other Respects, save only in the
Article of Legisla∣tion and Letters, they animate each other by the early and
continued Use of Melody, Dance, and Song, to Valour in Arms, to Constancy
in Torments and Death<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>LAFITAU, tom. iii. p. 171.
tom. iv. p. g.</BIBL></NOTE>. This is found, in Fact, to be an Education of
such mighty In∣fluence, that the <HI>War-Song</HI> and <HI>Death-Song</HI>
inspire whole Tribes with a Degree of <HI>Fury</HI> and <HI>Indurance,</HI>
which hath become the Astonishment of all who have <HI>seen</HI> but

<P>THE Origin, Nature, and Power, of the ancient Greek Music being
thus explained; let us now proceed to a like Application of the remaining
Articles of the fourth <PB N="96" REF="99"/> Section; in which we shall

<P N="14">14. "The <HI>Dance</HI> was separated from the
<HI>Song</HI>; and with or without <HI>Melody</HI> became itself a distinct
Exercise or Art, under the Title of <HI>Gymnastic,</HI> for the Sake of
increasing their Strength and Agility of Body, as the Means of rendering them
invincible in War." This was the natural Effect of their warlike Character, for
the Reason given above<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>See Sect. iv. Art.
14.</BIBL></NOTE>. And that this was the real Generation of the
<HI>Gymnastic</HI> Art, appears evidently from PLATO's Book of <HI>Laws:</HI>
where, having spoken of the three constituent Parts of a compleat
<HI>Choir</HI> (Melody, Dance, and Song) he proceeds to deduce from these the
Origin of the <HI>Gymnastic</HI> Art. 
<Q REND="inline">"Is not this the leading Principle of the
<HI>Gymnastic</HI> Art, that every Creature is born with a natural
Inclination to leap or bound? But Man, being endowed with a Sense of
<HI>Rythm</HI> or <HI>Numbers,</HI> naturally formed his Motions into
<HI>Dance: Melody</HI> natu∣rally begets <HI>Rythm</HI>; and these two
<HI>united</HI> form the <HI>Gymnastic.</HI>—For <HI>That</HI> we call
the <HI>Gymnastic,</HI> when the <HI>Dance</HI> is so artificially applied,
as to improve the Powers of the Body<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><BIBL><HI>De
Leg.</HI> l. ii.</BIBL></NOTE>."</Q> That this Art was applied by the an∣cient
<HI>Greeks</HI> to the End of public and warlike Service, is generally known:
However, if it needs a Proof, another Passage of the same Author will
sufficiently confirm it. 
<Q REND="inline">"After these Instructions (in <HI>Music</HI>)
the Parents send their Sons to the Masters of the <HI>Gymnastic</HI>
Schools, that by <PB N="97" REF="100"/> gaining a firm Habit of Body, which may
second a well-formed Mind, they may be able to indure the Toils of
<HI>Enterprise</HI> and <HI>War</HI><NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>In
Protag.</BIBL></NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>We trace the Foundation and Progress of the <HI>Gymnastic</HI>
Art no less clearly in LUCIAN's Account. 
<Q REND="inline">"The <HI>Spar∣tans,</HI> having received this Art
(of Dancing) from CAS∣TOR and POLLUX, went <HI>dancing</HI> to <HI>Battle,</HI>
to the Sound of Flutes: Their Application to Music did not lessen their
Attention to Arms: For a Musician sat in the midst of the Assembly,
and played on the Flute, beating Time with his Foot; while they regularly
followed the Measure, in a Variety of warlike Postures<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>De Saltatione.</BIBL></NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>To confirm these Evidences, we may add another In∣stance of a
warlike <HI>Dance,</HI> which approacheth nearest to the Establishment of
the <HI>Gymnastic</HI> Exercise, of any record∣ed by Antiquity. XENOPHON,
in his "Expedition of CYRUS," describes one of these Dances in the
following Manner. 
<Q REND="inline">"The <HI>Feast</HI> being ended, the
<HI>Libations</HI> made, and the <HI>Hymn</HI> sung, two <HI>Thracians,</HI>
completely armed, began to dance to the Sound of the Flute: After
skir∣mishing for some time with their Swords, one of them (as wounded)
fell down, on which the <HI>Paphlagonians</HI> set up a loud Cry. The
Conqueror having stripped his Adversary, departed, singing his
Victory."</Q>—Here we see a near Approach to the Forms of the
<HI>Gymnastic</HI> Exer∣cise in their most essential Circumstances,
yet the original Form of the <HI>Dance</HI> remains.</P>
<P>Thus the Origin of the <HI>Gymnastic</HI> Arts is clearly
un∣folded, as being no more than a Part of the savage <HI>Song-Feast</HI>; 
<PB N="98" REF="101"/> <HI>Feast</HI>; but separated from thence for the
Ends of war∣like Service. For Want of this Information, the learned VOSSIUS,
among other Authors, stiles the <HI>Dance</HI> a Branch of the
<HI>Gymnastic,</HI> instead of regarding the <HI>Gymnastic</HI> as the
Offspring of the <HI>Dance</HI><NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot"><BIBL><HI>De Nat.
Art.</HI> l. i. c. 3.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P>Here we may farther observe, that this View of the
<HI>Gymnastic,</HI> considered as having been originally a Branch of the
<HI>Musical</HI> Art, clears up a Difficulty with which every other Account
of it is encumbered. Thus a late Writer says, 
<Q REND="inline">"The Exercise of <HI>leaping</HI> in the
<HI>Pentathlon</HI> was ac∣companied by <HI>Flutes,</HI> playing
<HI>Pythian</HI> Airs, as PAUSA∣NIAS informs us. Whence this Custom was
derived, I cannot say: And the Reason assigned for it by that Author,
which is certainly not the true one, may induce us to think, that in this
Matter the Ancients were as ignorant as we<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>WEST's
<HI>Transl. of</HI> PINDAR's <HI>Odes: Pref.</HI></BIBL></NOTE>."</Q> But on
the Principle here given, the Custom accounts for itself. In the first
Institution of the <HI>Gymnastic</HI> Arts, it appears that <HI>Melody</HI>
made a <HI>Part</HI> of them: This <HI>Part</HI> had been disused (by
Course of Time) in the <HI>other</HI> Exercises, but had been retained in
that of <HI>Leaping</HI> in the <HI>Pentathlon.</HI></P>
<P N="15">15. "After a certain Period of Civilization, the
<HI>complex</HI> Character of <HI>Legislator</HI> and <HI>Bard</HI> did
<HI>separate,</HI> and were seldom united." This Separation, it hath been
shewn above, would of course follow from decreasing Enthusiasm, and
the increasing Labours of Government. And such was the natural Rise of
the <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> or <HI>Bards</HI> of ancient
GREECE: Of whose <HI>Profession</HI> and <HI>Art</HI> a late learned
Au∣thor<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot"><BIBL><HI>Enquiry into the Life and Writings
of</HI> HOMER.</BIBL></NOTE> hath, in many Circumstances, though not in all, 
<PB N="99" REF="102"/> given a just Idea. Of its original Dignity and
Importance, in the most ancient Times, he did not rightly conceive; through
his Ignorance of its true Rise, and original Union with the Legislator's
Office. He represents them as wan∣dering Musicians only, who were
<HI>welcome</HI> to the Houses of the <HI>Great.</HI> Such indeed they were,
in the <HI>later</HI> Periods; when the Separation had been long formed, and
their Office become rather an Affair of <HI>Amusement</HI> than
<HI>Utility.</HI> But as in the earliest Periods the <HI>Legislators</HI>
themselves were often <HI>Bards,</HI> so when the Separation of Character
was first made, the known Influence and Importance of their Office could make
them no other than <HI>Assistants</HI> to the <HI>Magistrate,</HI> in
the high Task of governing the People. Of this we have a clear Instance in
the Commonwealth of SPARTA (which maintained all its original Institutions
the most pure and unchanged) where a dangerous Insur∣rection arose; nor
could be quelled by the Magistrate, till the Bard TERPANDER came, and played
and sung at their public Place of Congress<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>SUIDAS, <HI>on the Lesbian Song.</HI></BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P>HESIOD, who was himself of this Order, hath given us a noble
Description of their Office and Dignity: Which, as it strongly confirms the
Genealogy here given, I shall translate at large; together with his Picture
of the <HI>Ma∣gistrate</HI>; along with whom the <HI>Bard</HI> appears to
co-operate in the public Welfare, as the <HI>second</HI> Character in the
<HI>Com∣munity.</HI> 
<Q REND="inline">"Therefore Kings (Magistrates) are watchful, that
they may do Justice to the injured, at the Place of public Congress,
soothing the Passions of Men by per∣suasive Speech: The People
reverence him as a God, <PB N="100" REF="103"/> while he passes through the
City.—<HI>Kings</HI> are from JOVE: <HI>Bards</HI> are from the
<HI>Muses</HI> and the far-shooting APOLLO. Happy is He whom the Muses
love: His Lips flow with sweet and soothing Accents. If any hath a keen and
inward Grief, fresh-rankling in his Soul; the Bard, the Muses Minister,
no sooner sings the Praise of <HI>ancient Heroes,</HI> and the
<HI>Gods</HI> who inhabit OLYMPUS, than he forgets his Sorrows, and feels no
more his Anguish.—Hail, Daughters of JOVE! Inspire <HI>Me</HI> with
your persuasive Song<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>HES.
THEOG.</BIBL></NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>It seems probable that the original <HI>Dignity</HI> of the
<HI>Bard's</HI> Character was always maintained longer in
<HI>Commonwealths</HI> than under despotic or <HI>kingly</HI> Governments:
For at the Court of ALCINOUS, so early as the Age of HOMER's He∣roes, it
appears, from the Picture given of DEMODOCUS, to have sunk into a Character
of <HI>Dependance</HI><NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Odyss.</BIBL></NOTE>.
The Reason is manifest: The <HI>Republican</HI> Form subsists by an
united Exertion of the Powers of every Rank: Under the <HI>despotic</HI>
Rule, the Influence of these various Powers is swallowed up in the
absolute Will of ONE. We shall see the Bard's Character rising again in
its dignified State, in the early Periods of other barbarous Nations<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>See below, Sect. viii.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P N="16">16. "In the Course of Time, and Progress of Polity and
Arts, a <HI>Separation</HI> of the several <HI>Kinds</HI> of <HI>Song</HI>
did arise. In the early Periods they lay confused; and were mingled in the
same Composition, as Inclination, En∣thusiasm, or other Incidents might
impel."—This Fact is manifest enough, from the Catalogue already given
of the Writings of the most ancient Bards of GREECE; for 
<PB N="101" REF="104"/> by this it appears, that they ranged at large through
the Fields of Poetry and <HI>Song,</HI> without giving any precise or
legitimate Form to their Compositions; which seem most generally to have
been a rapturous Mixture of <HI>Hymn, History, Fable,</HI> and
<HI>Mythology,</HI> thrown out by the en∣thusiastic Bard in legislative
Songs, as different Motives or Occasions presented themselves, and
according to the Exi∣gencies or Capacity of his surrounding Audience.—<Q REND="inline">"But repeated Trial and Experiment produced a more
artifi∣cial Manner; and thus by Degrees, the several Kinds of Poem
assumed their legitimate Forms."</Q>—For the Truth of this, we refer
to the following Articles.</P>
<P N="17">17. "HYMNS or <HI>Odes</HI> were composed, and
<HI>sung</HI> by their Composers at their festal Solemnities." This
Species of Song hath, in the Way of Preheminence, and beyond any other, gained
the Title of <HI>lyric Poetry.</HI> Nor can we won∣der at this, if we
consider, that from its Nature it must have arisen first, must have
been first moulded into Form, and must, from its peculiar Genius, continue
united with <HI>Melody</HI> longer and more universally than any other. It
arose first, because it was natural for the savage Mind, to throw
itself out in sudden Exclamations of Grief or Joy, Love, Revenge, or
Anguish, before it could find Means or Leisure to recite at large the
Occasions of these powerful Feelings: It must be first moulded into
Form, because its Extent is the smallest, and its Plan most simple:
It must continue united with <HI>Melody</HI> longer and more universally
than any other Species, because the very Essence of its Sub∣ject is that
which the other Kinds only catch incidentally, I mean, the sudden Shocks and
Emotions of the Soul; which are found to be the powerful Bands of Nature, by 
<PB N="102" REF="105"/> which <HI>Melody</HI> and <HI>Song</HI> are most
closely bound toge∣ther.</P>
<P>PLUTARCH confirms this Reasoning concerning the <HI>Priority</HI>
of the <HI>hymnal</HI> Species; and says, that 
<Q REND="inline">"Music was <HI>first</HI> used in religious
Ceremonies, being employed in the <HI>Praises</HI> of the <HI>Gods</HI>; and
that <HI>afterwards</HI> it was applied to <HI>other</HI> Subjects<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>De Musica</BIBL></NOTE>."</Q> Accordingly we find, that in
the several successive Periods, ALCAEUS, STESICHORUS, TYRTAEUS, and
others, composed and sung their <HI>Odes</HI> at the public Festivals.
The sublime PINDAR was not more celebrated for his mighty Strains, than for
his powerful Performance of them at the <HI>Olympic Games:</HI> Nay, so high
was his Fame in this Regard, that he had a golden Chair appropriated to him in
the Temple of DELPHI, where he poured forth the Torrent of his Songs, which
were attend∣ed to, and revered as Oracles issuing from the Inspiration of
the God.</P>
<P N="18">18. "The <HI>Epic</HI> Poem arose; and was sung by its
Com∣posers at their festal Solemnities."—When the first Fire of
Enthusiasm had vented itself in the Rapture of <HI>Hymns</HI> and
<HI>Odes,</HI> it naturally assumed a more <HI>sedate</HI> Manner; and
found Time to <HI>relate</HI> at large those Actions which in its first
Agitations it could only celebrate by sudden Bursts of Passion and
Praise. Accordingly, we find many of the elder Poets of GREECE mixing the
<HI>hymnal</HI> and <HI>enthusiastic</HI> with the <HI>historic</HI> or
<HI>narrative</HI> Species. The Exploits of BAC∣CHUS, the Rape of PROSERPINE,
the Wars of the TITANS, were among their favourite Themes. After these, came
the Authors of the <HI>Herculiad</HI> and <HI>Thesiad:</HI> DEMODOCUS, 
<PB N="103" REF="106"/> prior to HOMER, sung the Ambush of the <HI>Trojan
Horse:</HI> PHEMIUS sung the Return of the <HI>Greeks</HI> under
AGAMEM∣NON: The <HI>little Iliad</HI> comprised most of the subsequent
Adventures of the <HI>Trojan War.</HI> A <HI>Thebaid</HI> was also writ∣ten,
the Author of which is not certainly known; though PAUSANIAS tells us, it was
by many ascribed to HO∣MER<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>L.
ix.</BIBL></NOTE>. As Example, Habit, and improving Arts and Polity, are the
necessary Means of Progress in every Art, so these Accounts, though
imperfectly conveyed to us (be∣cause the Poems they allude to are lost)
sufficiently imply, that the <HI>Epic</HI> Muse advanced <HI>gradually</HI>
towards Perfection; till at length she appeared in full Splendor, in the
Person of her favoured HOMER.</P>
<P>HERODOTUS, indeed, has thrown out a Hint, as if the <HI>Iliad</HI>
was prior to the oldest of the Poems ascribed to these most ancient
Bards<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot"><BIBL><HI>In</HI> EUTERPE.</BIBL></NOTE>.
VELLEIUS PATERCULUS af∣firms the same thing in stronger Terms<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>L. i. c. 5.</BIBL></NOTE>: And Mr. POPE goes into this
Opinion<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Diss. prefixed to his Trans. of the
<HI>Iliad.</HI></BIBL></NOTE>. It must be confessed, the History of
these remote Ages is so dark and fabulous, that nothing can with Certainty
be collected from them. But the very Structure of HOMER's Poem carries in
itself such an internal Evidence, as turns the Scale against the
Historian's Conjecture. If we consider the Nature of the human Mind, we
shall be led to believe, that the <HI>Epic</HI> Poem must have received a
<HI>gradual</HI> Improvement through that long though unknown Tract of Time,
during which its unpolished Rudiments existed before the Age of HO∣MER. The
mere Powers of <HI>Fancy</HI> and <HI>Execution</HI> may, <PB N="104" REF="107"/> indeed, arrive at their highest Perfection by the Efforts of a
<HI>single Mind:</HI> For what belongs to Nature only, Nature only can
complete; and thus our immortal SHAKESPEAR arose: But that an <HI>Epic</HI>
PLAN, so <HI>complex,</HI> so <HI>vast,</HI> and yet so
<HI>perfect</HI> as that of the <HI>Iliad</HI>; which requires an uncom∣mon
Penetration even to comprehend in all its Variety and Art; which the
thoughtful, the literate, the polished VIRGIL attempted to rival, and only
proved his utter In∣ability by his Attempt; which succeeding Poets have made
their Model, yet none have ever equalled or approached, save only the
all-comprehending Mind of the sublime MILTON;—that such a Plan as
This, which required the highest Efforts of an improved Understanding,
opened and strengthened by a Succession of preceding Examples, should
at once emerge in all the Extent of Art, in the midst of rude and unformed
Fables, sung at Festivals as vague Enthusiasm might
inspire;—this is an Opinion re∣pugnant to all our Notices concerning
the Progress of the Powers of the human Mind. We may as rationally
sup∣pose that St. PAUL's was the first built Temple, its <HI>Organ</HI>
the first musical Instrument, the LAOCOON and his Sons the first
Attempt in Statuary, the <HI>Transfiguration</HI> the first Essay in
Picture, as that the <HI>stupendous Iliad,</HI> the Wonder of all
succeeding Ages, was the <HI>first</HI> Attempt in <HI>Epic</HI>
Poetry.</P>
<P>What the Nature of the Thing so strongly declares, ARISTOTLE
seems to confirm in his Poetics: For he says, that 
<Q REND="inline">"although we know not the Names either of the Poems
or their Authors; yet there is Reason to believe that many had been written
before HOMER; and that his <HI>Margites</HI> brought this Species to its
Perfection, in <PB N="105" REF="108"/> the same Manner as the <HI>Iliad</HI>
and <HI>Odyssey</HI> had compleated the Form of the Epic Poem<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot"><BIBL><HI>Poet.</HI> c. iv.</BIBL></NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>We may reasonably conclude, therefore, that from the Days of
LINUS, down to those of HOMER, there had been a Succession of Writers,
among whom the Form of the <HI>Epic</HI> Poem had been <HI>gradually</HI>
advancing towards Per∣fection, till it received its full Completion in the
Birth of the <HI>Iliad.</HI></P>
<P>That these Epic Songs, in their several Periods, were sung by
their Composers to the surrounding People, we have the general Testimony
of ancient Writers. This Fact is so clear, with Respect to the elder Poets
of GREECE, that it is much questioned whether ever their <HI>Songs</HI> were
committed to <HI>Writing:</HI> Whether they were any more than the extempore
Efforts of a sudden En∣thusiasm, kindled by the sympathetic Power of
<HI>religious Rites,</HI> or <HI>State-Festivals.</HI> That HOMER followed
the honourable Profession of a <HI>Bard,</HI> and sung his own Poems at
the public Feasts, hath been proved at large by a learned Writer<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot"><BIBL><HI>Life</HI> of HOMER, Sect. vii, viii.</BIBL></NOTE>.
HESIOD was of the same Order; and seems to have maintained it with truer
Dignity<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>THEOG. <HI>Exord.</HI> ver. 23,
&amp;c.</BIBL></NOTE>: TERPANDER held the same Employment, and sung both
his own Poems and those of HOMER<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>PLUTARCH
<HI>de Musica</HI></BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P N="19">19. "From an <HI>Union</HI> of these two Kinds, a certain
rude Outline of <HI>Tragedy</HI> arose."—For when a Bard sung the
great or terrible Atchievements of a Heroe or God, the surrounding
<HI>Audience,</HI> fired to Enthusiasm, and already prepared by a
correspondent Education, would naturally <PB N="106" REF="109"/> break forth
into the Raptures of a <HI>choral Song.</HI>—This Progression of
Poetry is so natural, that it is Matter of Astonishment to hear the
learned at all Times ascribing the Rise of Tragedy to Causes merely
accidental; and confining it to the single Adventure of THESPIS and his
Route, singing the Praises of BACCHUS at a <HI>casual</HI> Vin∣tage. Thus
DACIER, among others, affirms roundly, that 
<Q REND="inline">"The first dramatic Person which THESPIS
<HI>invented,</HI> was only <HI>designed</HI> to give Respite to the Choir;
and what he recited was no more than an Appendage to Tragedy<NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot"><BIBL><HI>Sur les Poet D' Arist.</HI> p. 47.</BIBL></NOTE>."</Q>
In the same Manner the sensible and learned BRUMOY delivers at large the
common System, with Respect to the Birth and Progress of the
<HI>tragic</HI> Species<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot"><BIBL><HI>Theat. des
Grecs.</HI> tom. vi. p. 310, &amp;c.</BIBL></NOTE>. All this is in
Contradiction to the Workings of Nature; and, without Proof, supposes That
to be a <HI>casual Invention</HI> in a <HI>particular</HI> Instance, which
was indeed the <HI>natural Progress</HI> of Passion expressed by
<HI>Melody, Dance,</HI> and <HI>Song.</HI> We have seen, that an Union of
Nar∣ration and concurrent Shouts of Praise takes Place even in the rude
Festivals of the savage Tribes: 'Tis altogether repugnant, therefore, to
the Nature of Things to sup∣pose, when <HI>Letters</HI> had given Accents
to the Rapture of the surrounding Audience, and moulded the Ode into Form,
that this natural Union should not be upheld. Though, therefore, the first
Rise and Progress of the tragic Species in GREECE were hid in Darkness,
through a Want of recording History, yet, from a Similarity of Causes and
Effects which we find among the barbarous Nations of AMERICA, we might fairly
conclude, that it had not a <PB N="107" REF="110" MS="y"/> <HI>casual,</HI>
but a <HI>certain</HI> Rise from <HI>Nature</HI>; according to the Principles
here given.</P>
<P>But ancient History is not silent on this Subject. It gives us a
Variety of Facts, which overturn the common System, and tend to confirm what
is here advanced. PLATO says expresly, that 
<Q REND="inline">"Tragedy was very ancient in the City of ATHENS, and
practised there, long before the Age of THESPIS<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>MINOS.</BIBL></NOTE>."</Q> We are assured, on the
Au∣thority of other Writers, that 
<Q REND="inline">"a Report prevailed in GREECE, that certain tragic
Poets had in ancient Times contended at the Tomb of THESEUS<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>See VOSSIUS <HI>Poët.</HI> l. ii. c.
12.</BIBL></NOTE>."</Q> SUIDAS even mentions one EPIGENES by Name, a tragic
Poet, prior to the Age of THESPIS.</P>
<P>But a still stronger Evidence presents itself: For even the
very Substance and Form of one of these rude Out∣lines of savage Tragedy
remains in a respectable Author of Antiquity. 
<Q REND="inline">"In ancient Times (saith STRABO) there was a
Contest of Musicians who sung <HI>Paeans</HI> in Cele∣bration of the God
APOLLO: This was established by the Inhabitants of DELPHI, after the
<HI>Chrissaean</HI> War."</Q> The Description of this Contest is not
incurious. 
<Q REND="inline">"The Poem was composed by TIMOSTHENES: The Subject
was the Victory of APOLLO over the <HI>Serpent:</HI> The <HI>first</HI> Part
was the <HI>Prelude</HI> to the Battle; the <HI>second</HI> was the
<HI>Beginning</HI> of the Engagement; the <HI>third,</HI> the <HI>Battle</HI>
it∣self; the <HI>fourth</HI> was the <HI>Paean</HI> or <HI>Triumph</HI> on

<HI>His∣sing</HI> of the <HI>dying Serpent</HI><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>STRABO, l. ix.</BIBL></NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="108" REF="111"/>Here we have the very Form and Substance of
a first rude Essay towards <HI>Tragedy,</HI> compounded of
<HI>Narration</HI> and <HI>Correspondent Songs</HI> of <HI>Triumph.</HI></P>
<P>Nay, as a farther Confirmation, not only of this parti∣cular
Article, but of the general Principles on which this Dissertation is built,
we learn from other Authors, that APOLLO himself was the <HI>Founder</HI> of
these <HI>Contests</HI><NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>See J. SCALIGER
<HI>Poët.</HI> l. i. c. 23.</BIBL></NOTE>: that the <HI>God</HI> was the

<P>It appears, therefore, that Tragedy had a much earlier and deeper

Rout: That it arose from <HI>Nature,</HI> and an unforced <HI>Union</HI> and
<HI>Progression</HI> of <HI>Melody, Dance,</HI> and <HI>Song.</HI></P>
<P>At the same Time it is manifest, that THESPIS added
<HI>something</HI> to the rude and savage Form of Tragedy, as it existed
in <HI>his</HI> Age. 'Tis probable that He was the <HI>first Declaimer</HI>
or <HI>Interlocutor</HI> to <HI>his own Choir</HI>; that he first
established the <HI>Profession</HI> of a <HI>Player</HI> in ATTICA, and
first transported his <HI>Company</HI> from one Village to another;
whereas, before his Time, the Exhibitions of the rude tragic Scene had been
fixed, and merely <HI>incidental</HI><NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>HOR.
<HI>Ep. ad</HI> PIS.—DIOG. LAERT. SOLON.</BIBL></NOTE>. This
Institution of an itinerant Company must necessarily in∣crease 
<PB N="109" REF="112"/> the general Attention of ATTICA to these rude tra∣gic
Scenes: And hence the Opinion seems first to have arisen, that THESPIS
was the <HI>Inventor</HI> of this Species<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot"> 
<P>The most learned BENTLEY fell into the common System, with
Regard to the Rise of Tragedy: Attempting to prove, that THESPIS was its
<HI>Inventor.</HI> Thus, for Want of the true <HI>Data,</HI> and from an
Unac∣quaintance with Man in his savage State, this great Critic hath thrown
out a Chain of Errors: While, if he had been led up to the true Foun∣tains of
Information, he would probably have caught the various Pro∣gressions of
Poetry at a Glance.</P> 
<P>Mr. BOYLE, in his Examination of BENTLEY's Dissertation,
seems once or twice to get out of the common Track of Criticism on his
Subject: Yet, for Want of knowing the true Origin of Tragedy, as founded in
hu∣man Nature, he throws little or no Light upon the Question. He
insists, that Tragedy is more ancient than THESPIS, on the Authority of
PLATO and LAERTIUS: But he falls again into the vulgar Track, in affirming,
that till the Time of THESPIS, the <HI>Episode</HI> had no Existence, but
only the <HI>Choir.</HI> In Confutation of which Opinion we have now shewn,
that the full Form of savage Tragedy had appeared many Ages before, in the
first Institution of the <HI>Pythian Games.</HI></P></NOTE>.</P>
<P N="20">20. "In Process of Time, this barbarous Scene im∣proved
into a more perfect Form: Instead of <HI>relating,</HI> they
<HI>represented</HI> by an <HI>assumed Character,</HI> and by
<HI>Action</HI> and <HI>Song,</HI> those great or terrible Atchievements
which their Heroes had performed." How soon the savage Tribes fall into
this Kind of dramatic Representation, we have already seen<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Above, Sect. ii.</BIBL></NOTE>: How natural such a
Progression of Art must be to the human Mind, will appear by reflecting,
that dramatic <HI>Action</HI> is but another Mode of <HI>Narration</HI>; and
that even the <HI>Narration</HI> of the savage Tribes is found to have such
a Mixture of <HI>Action</HI> in it, as strongly tends to produce the dramatic
Imitation<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Ibid.</BIBL></NOTE>. Time, therefore,
and repeated Efforts must naturally advance the <HI>narrative</HI> 
<PB N="110" REF="113"/> <HI>Episode</HI> into <HI>personal
Representation.</HI> And thus we are arrived at the Form which Tragedy wore,
when the in∣ventive Genius of ESCHYLUS advanced the Art one Step higher; and by
adding a <HI>second Person</HI> to the Drama, brought in the Use of
<HI>Dialogue.</HI></P>
<P>Here, for the Sake of Truth, we must again depart from the general
Body of Critics; most of whom, from ARIS∣TOTLE down to our own Times, unite
in supposing rhat ESCHYLUS was only a casual Imitator of HOMER, and drew
the Idea of all his Tragedies from the ILIAD. A noble Critic of our own Country
hath affirmed this in the fewest and strongest Terms; and says, that 
<Q REND="inline">"There was no more left for Tragedy to do after him
(HOMER) than to erect a Stage, and draw his Dialogues and Characters into
Scenes<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot"><BIBL><HI>Characteristic,</HI> vol. i. p.
197.</BIBL></NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>It may be deemed presumptuous, perhaps, to question a Point
wherein the great Master-Critic of GREECE hath himself decided. But let us
remember, that the Days are now past, when it was held a Point of Honour, to
<HI>swear</HI> to the <HI>Opinions</HI> of a <HI>Master.</HI> ARISTOTLE is
often ad∣mirable, generally judicious, yet sometimes perhaps mis∣taken,
even in his Judgment of Men and Things relative to his own Country. He was more
especially capable of being misled by the common Opinion in this Point; in
which neither He nor any of his Countrymen could be sufficiently informed,
for Want of a competent Knowledge of the Genius and Character of savage
Manners.</P>
<P>That ESCHYLUS was not a mere Imitator of HOMER, that he was a great
and original Poet, who exalted his Art one Degree beyond his Predecessors
in his own Country, seems <PB N="111" REF="114"/> a Point which collateral
Arguments strongly confirm. We are informed, in general Terms, that there
were no less than fifteen tragic Poets who writ before him: And the
Probability is much stronger, that he should draw his Improvement from the
<HI>scenic</HI> Representations already established, in which he found
one dramatic Person and an accompanying <HI>Choir,</HI> which, in all
Probability, stood in the Place of a second Person, and often
sustained a Kind of Dialogue with the principal Interlocutor<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">This Opinion receives a strong Confirmation from the following
Circumstance, that in the <HI>Greek Tragedies</HI> which have come down to
us, whenever there is a <HI>single Interlocutor</HI> on the Stage, the
<HI>Choir</HI> frequently maintains a <HI>Dialogue</HI> with him.</NOTE>; than
that he should have Recourse to HOMER's Poems, in which no dramatic
Representation was to be found.</P>
<P>To this Argument may be added another, drawn from the Style and
Manner of ESCHYLUS, so different from that of HOMER. For HOMER is equal,
large, flowing, and harmonious: ESCHYLUS is uneven, concise, abrupt, and
rugged: The one leads you through the grand but gentle Declivities of Hill and
Dale; the other carries you over a continued Chain of Rocks and Precipices. Now
if HOMER had been the Model of ESCHYLUS, some <HI>Similarity</HI> of
<HI>Manner</HI> would probably have ensued.</P>
<P>A third and still stronger Proof arises from the essential
Difference of their Subjects, both in Extent and Nature: In Extent, because
the one is of <HI>long,</HI> the other of short Duration: In Nature,
because HOMER's Poems are chiefly employed in the Exhibition of
<HI>Character</HI> and <HI>Manners</HI>; those of ESCHYLUS in the
Representation of <HI>Terror</HI> and <HI>Distress.</HI> Had he been that
mere Imitator of HOMER which the Critics have adjudged him, and had nothing to 
<PB N="112" REF="115"/> do but to erect a Stage, and to draw HOMER's Dialogues
into Scenes, he would have been content to have taken <HI>his</HI> Subjects
from the <HI>Iliad,</HI> and, according to HORACE's sober Rule, have never
ventured beyond the Siege of <HI>Troy</HI><NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>RECTIUS ILIACOS, &amp;c.</BIBL></NOTE>. He would have
brought upon the Stage the Anger of ACHILLES, the Battle of PARIS and MENELAUS,
the Part∣ing of HECTOR and ANDROMACHE, the Feats of DIO∣MEDE; and would have
contrasted the <HI>strength</HI> of AJAX with the <HI>Cunning</HI> of
ULYSSES. Nothing of all this ap∣pears: On the contrary, his <HI>Subjects</HI>
and <HI>Manner</HI> are equal∣ly <HI>his own</HI>; and <HI>both</HI> of a
Genius opposite to those of HOMER.</P>
<P>What PLUTARCH says of HOMER, though brought for the contrary
Purpose, tends to confirm all that is here ad∣vanced. 
<Q REND="inline">"Even Tragedy took its Rise from HOMER: For his
Poems comprehend every thing that is <HI>sublime</HI> and <HI>great</HI><NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot"><BIBL><HI>In Vita</HI> HOMERI.</BIBL></NOTE>."</Q> This, you
will say, is a very insufficient Reason, because the Critic forgets the
<HI>pathetic</HI> and the <HI>terrible,</HI> which were the essential
Constituents of the Greek Tragedy. But mark the Sequel; which is still more
ex∣traordinary. 
<Q REND="inline">"Neither do they (HOMER's Poems) con∣tain
Descriptions of those <HI>atrocious Actions</HI> which have been feigned by
the later Tragedians, such as <HI>Incest,</HI> and the <HI>Murder</HI> of
<HI>Parents</HI> or <HI>Children.</HI> Nay, whenever he happens to touch on any
thing of this Kind, he always <HI>softens</HI> and throws it <HI>into
Shades</HI><NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Ibid.</BIBL></NOTE>."</Q> Thus while
PLUTARCH is labouring to prove, that the <HI>Greek</HI> Tragedy was
<HI>drawn</HI> from HOMER, he proves, that HOMER's Poems were
<HI>destitute</HI> of that which was of the <HI>Essence</HI> of the
<HI>Greek</HI> Tragedy.</P>
<P><PB N="113" REF="116"/>SCALIGER is a venerable exception to the
general Body of the Critics on this Subject; and seems to have viewed the
Question in its true Light. 
<Q REND="inline">"In the <HI>Iliad</HI> (saith he) there is nothing
like the <HI>Progression</HI> of a <HI>Tragedy,</HI> if you take the
<HI>whole</HI> together: For, from Beginning to End, there is a
<HI>perpetual</HI> Succession of <HI>Deaths:</HI> He begins with a
Pestilence, which destroys more Men than the whole War<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot"><BIBL><HI>Poët.</HI> l. i. c. 5.</BIBL></NOTE>."</Q> The
Critic then goes on to prove, by a large Enumeration of Circumstances, the
<HI>Iliad</HI> hath very few of the essential Characteristics of
<HI>Tragedy.</HI></P>
<P>We may fairly conclude, then, that the Improvement which Tragedy
received from ESCHYLUS was not <HI>casual,</HI> but the Result of a
<HI>natural Progression:</HI> That he drew not from HOMER's Poems, as a
mere Imitator; but exalted his Art one Step higher, from the Force of true
<HI>Genius</HI> in the <HI>tragic</HI> Species.</P>
<P>What followed is well known: SOPHOCLES added a <HI>third</HI>
Person to the Drama: And by this Improvement is said by the Critics to have
<HI>compleated</HI> the Form of Tragedy. The Truth of their Decision I much
doubt: but this Disquisition lies beyond the Limits of our present
En∣quiry.</P>
<P N="21">21. "As the Choir was established by Nature and Custom,
and animated their Solemnities by <HI>Dance</HI> as well as <HI>Song</HI>; the
Melody, Dance, and Song, did of Course regulate each other; and the Ode or
Song natu∣rally fell into <HI>Stanzas</HI> of some <HI>particular</HI> Kind."
This arose by an easy Progression from the savage State; where 
<PB N="114" REF="117"/> 
<Q REND="inline">"they who dance, go round in a circular Movement,
and after a short Interval being a second<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>See
Sect. ii.</BIBL></NOTE>."</Q> The <HI>Greeks</HI> not only fell into this
Manner, but improved upon it: They went round, first to the one Hand, then to
the other, and then paused. The Learned have found out mystical Reasons
for these circular Movements; referring them to the Motion of the
Planets<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>ATHENAEUS <HI>Deip.</HI> l.
i.</BIBL></NOTE>. Much Labour cannot be necessary for the Confutation of
these Refinements, as the Practice arose so evidently from the Dictates
of Nature: It was a natural and sensible Improvement; for the plain
Reason of <HI>preventing Giddiness,</HI> which ariseth from running round
in the same Circle.</P>
<P>Let us attend, therefore, to its Consequences. As each
<HI>Dance</HI> or <HI>Return</HI> was marked by its peculiar
<HI>Measure,</HI> this of Course fixed both the <HI>Melody</HI> and poetic
<HI>Numbers</HI> of the accompanying Song: And as they likewise sung during
the <HI>Interval</HI> of Rest, we see, that from this easy Improve∣ment
on the savage Song-Feast, the <HI>Strophe, Antistrophe,</HI> and
<HI>Epode,</HI> naturally arose.</P>
<P N="22">22. "Another Consequence of the established
<HI>Choir</HI> was a strict and unvaried Adherence to the <HI>Unities</HI> of
<HI>Place</HI> and <HI>Time.</HI>" This Effect is so manifest as to need
little Illustration. A numerous <HI>Choir,</HI> maintaining their Station
through the whole Performance, gave so forcible a Conviction to the Senses,
of the <HI>Sameness</HI> of <HI>Place,</HI> and the <HI>Shortness</HI> of
<HI>Time,</HI> that any Deviation from this ap∣parent Unity must have
shocked the Imagination with an Improbability too gross to be indured.
Notwithstanding all the Panegyrics of the Critics, therefore, upon the Greek
Tragedians on Account of these <HI>Unities</HI>; it is evident, 
<PB N="115" REF="118"/> they arose in the rudest Periods; and were continued
through the more polished Ages, on the same Principle of untaught Nature
and established Custom.</P>
<P N="23">23. "Not only the Part of the tragic <HI>Choir,</HI> but the
<HI>Episode,</HI> or <HI>interlocutory</HI> Part, was also <HI>Sung.</HI>"
The most sensible of the Critics have ever regarded this as a
Circumstance equally unnatural and unaccountable. Thus DACIER speaks. 
<Q REND="inline">"It must be owned, that we cannot well comprehend,
how Music <HI>(Melody)</HI> could ever be considered as in any Respect
making a Part of Tragedy: For if there be any thing in the World that is at
Variance with <HI>tragic Action,</HI> it is <HI>Song</HI><NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot"><BIBL><HI>Sur</HI> ARISTOTE, p. 85, &amp;c.</BIBL></NOTE>."</Q>
The learned Critic is so shocked with this supposed Union, in
Appearance so unnatural, that upon the whole he questions its Existence;
and is of Opinion, that when ARISTOTLE speaks of <HI>Music,</HI> as being
annexed to <HI>Tragedy,</HI> he speaks of the <HI>Choir</HI> only<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Ibid.</BIBL></NOTE>. This, however, is contrary to the
united Voice of Antiquity, which universally admits the Fact, though its
Origin was never accounted for. But how naturally this union took Place in
ancient Tragedy, we now clearly discover, by investigating the Rise and
Pro∣gress of this Poem from the savage State. For it appears, that the
<HI>Epic</HI> and <HI>Ode</HI> were both sung from the earliest Periods;
and therefore, when they became <HI>united,</HI> and by that Union formed the
tragic Species, they of Course maintained the same Appendage of
<HI>Melody,</HI> which Nature and Custom had already given them.</P>
<P>The <HI>Abbé du</HI> Bos endeavours to prove, indeed, that
the <HI>Song</HI> which was employed in the <HI>Episode</HI> of ancient
Tra∣gedy <PB N="116" REF="119"/> was no more than a Kind of <HI>regulated</HI>
or <HI>measured Declamation</HI><NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot"><BIBL><HI>Reflec.
Crit.</HI> Part iii. c. 4, &amp;c.</BIBL></NOTE>. But his Inquiries are
partial; for he goes no higher than to the Practice of the <HI>Romans:</HI> And
it is probable, from several Circumstances, that in the late Period when
the <HI>Romans</HI> borrowed their Music from, the <HI>Greeks,</HI> the
Tragic <HI>Song</HI> had been brought down from a <HI>measured Melody</HI> to
a kind of <HI>regulated Declamation.</HI> Thus, TULLY mentions the <HI>Cantus
Subobscurus</HI>; and again saith, 
<Q REND="inline">"Delicatiores sunt falsae Voculae quam certae et
severae."</Q> But though these, with several other Argu∣ments alledged by
the <HI>Abbé,</HI> seem to imply that the tragic <HI>Song</HI> was
little more than a measured Recitation; yet this will by no means prove, that
a more full and direct Song had not been used in Tragedy thro' the more early
Periods. In the Course of this Dissertation, the Practice of
<HI>singing</HI> Tragedy hath been traced from its first Rise in savage
Manners; which at once destroys the <HI>Improbability</HI> of the Custom,
and proves that it was even founded in Nature; a Circumstance, of which the
<HI>Abbé</HI> had not the least Sus∣picion. This Foundation being
laid, we cannot but listen attentively to what the early Writers of GREECE
tell us on this Subject: Now these unite in informing us, that the
<HI>Episode</HI> of Tragedy was <HI>Sung</HI>; and even name the
<HI>Modes</HI> of Music which were appropriated to the <HI>Episode,</HI> in
Contradistinction to the <HI>Choir</HI><NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>ARISTOT. <HI>Prob.</HI> 19.</BIBL></NOTE>. That the
<HI>Song</HI> should approach nearer, by Degrees, to mere Declamation, will
appear probable, when we consider the gradual Sepa∣rations which
successively took Place in the musical Art, during the successive
Periods of GREECE and ROME. <PB N="117" REF="120"/> To mention only one
Instance here, similar to what we now treat of: ARISTOTLE informs us, that
in <HI>His</HI> Time the <HI>Rhapsodists,</HI> whose Profession it
was to <HI>sing</HI> the Poems of HOMER and HESIOD, were beginning to make
In∣roads into the ancient Practice; and now <HI>recited</HI> those
<HI>Poems,</HI> which in <HI>former Times</HI> had been always
<HI>sung</HI><NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot"><BIBL><HI>Poët.</HI> c.
26.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P>The <HI>Abbé</HI> falls into an Error with Respect to the
<HI>Dance,</HI> parallel to that which he adopts with Regard to the
<HI>Melody</HI> of the Ancients. As he insists that their <HI>tragic
Melody</HI> was only a <HI>measured Recitation,</HI> so he affirms, that
their <HI>tragic Dance</HI> was no more than <HI>Action</HI><NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot"><BIBL><HI>Reflec.</HI> Part. iii. c. 13.</BIBL></NOTE>. It is
true, that in the later Periods of <HI>Rome,</HI> when the musical
Sepa∣rations had taken Place, this was the general Meaning of the Word
<HI>Saltatio:</HI> And hence, as in his Opinion of the tragic Song, his
Mistake arose. For it is evident from the concurrent Testimony of the
elder <HI>Greek</HI> Writers, that the <HI>tragic Dance</HI> was performed in
the very Manner here de∣scribed. We now see, that this <HI>Dance</HI> (no
less than the <HI>tragic Song)</HI> arose from untaught Nature; and that it
was the genuine Parent of the <HI>Strophe, Antistrophe,</HI> and
<HI>Epode.</HI></P>
<P N="24">24. "As the <HI>Greek</HI> Nation was of a <HI>fierce</HI>
and <HI>warlike</HI> Character, their tragic Representations rowled chiefly
on Subjects of <HI>Distress</HI> and <HI>Terror.</HI>"—On this Topic,
I doubt whether ARISTOTLE hath not mistaken an <HI>Effect</HI> for a
<HI>Cause.</HI> For he says, that 
<Q REND="inline">"Tragedy, by means of <HI>Pity</HI> and
<HI>Terror,</HI> purgeth in us <HI>Those</HI> and other such like
<HI>Passions</HI><NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot"><BIBL><HI>Poët.</HI> c.

understand him, as <PB N="118" REF="121"/> meaning that Tragedy was formed
<HI>with this View.</HI> It is not the Writer's Design to remark on this
great Critic, far∣ther than what relates to his main Subject. Therefore it will
suffice to say, that if ARISTOTLE meant to assign this <HI>moral
End,</HI> as the <HI>Cause</HI> why Tragedy assumed this Form in ancient
GREECE, and adopted Subjects of <HI>Distress</HI> and <HI>Terror,</HI> He
seems to have taken That for a <HI>Cause,</HI> which was a <HI>natural
Effect</HI> of the ruling <HI>Manners</HI> of the <HI>Greek</HI> Republics. The
Reasons which support the general Truth, already given in the
correspondent Article, will hold their Force when applied here. For thus the
<HI>Greeks</HI> animat∣ed each other to <HI>Victory</HI> and <HI>Revenge,</HI>
by a Representation of what their Friends had <HI>done</HI> and
<HI>suffered.</HI> These Sub∣jects would likewise be most accommodated
to the natural Taste of the poetic Chiefs of such a People; whose
<HI>At∣chievements</HI> produced and abounded with Events of
<HI>Dis∣tress</HI> and <HI>Terror.</HI> Such then was the natural Origin
and Adoption of these Subjects in the <HI>Greek Tragedy:</HI> But after they
were established on this Foundation, 'tis proba∣ble that the Statesmen
encouraged and applied them to the <HI>Ends</HI> of Policy. For as the leading
View of a fierce and warlike People must be to <HI>destroy Pity</HI> and
<HI>Fear</HI>; so This would most effectually be done, by making
themselves familiar with distressful and terrible Repre∣sentations.
Under these Restrictions, the Opinion of ARISTOTLE may have a Foundation in
Nature: Farther than this; and as applied to any People whose End is not
<HI>War</HI> and <HI>Conquest,</HI> it carries the Appearance of a refined
Idea, which hath no Foundation in Nature. The grand scenic Representations
of the <HI>Peruvians</HI> and <HI>Chinese</HI> (as <PB N="119" REF="122"/>
will appear below<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Sect. viii.</BIBL></NOTE>)
whose leading Object was <HI>Peace,</HI> are known to be of a quite contrary
Nature, formed on their gentler Manners; and such as would have been
alto∣gether incompatible with the warlike Character, and in∣sipid to the
Taste of the Tribes of ancient GREECE.</P>
<P N="25">25. "Their Tragedy being designed as a visible
Repre∣sentation of their ancient Gods and Heroes, they in∣vented a Method of
strengthening the Voice, and ag∣grandizing the Visage and Person, as the
Means of com∣pleating the Resemblance." It is generally known, that the old
<HI>Grecian Gods</HI> were supposed to be of a Stature <HI>ex∣ceeding</HI>
that of <HI>ordinary</HI> Men: And the true Reason of that Opinion was,
because in the early Ages they (like every other barbarous People<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>See LAFITAU, and other Travellers.</BIBL></NOTE>) selected
the <HI>tallest</HI> and <HI>strongest</HI> Men for their
<HI>Chiefs:</HI> Which Chiefs in Course of Time became their <HI>Gods.</HI>
Hence the <HI>Buskin</HI> and <HI>Masque</HI> had their natural Birth: For
the first <HI>hightened</HI> the <HI>Stature,</HI> as the second
<HI>inlarged</HI> the <HI>Visage,</HI> and <HI>strengthened</HI> the
<HI>Voice</HI> of the dramatic Actor. And although the common Accounts mention
nothing of the <HI>Inlargement</HI> of the <HI>Body</HI>; yet we learn from
LUCIAN, that the <HI>Breast, Back,</HI> and all the <HI>Limbs,</HI> were
<HI>amplified</HI> in Proportion to the <HI>Visage</HI> and
<HI>Stature</HI><NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>De Saltatione.</BIBL></NOTE>:
Manifestly as the Means of compleating the Resemblance of their Gods and
Heroes.</P>
<P>By thus tracing the <HI>Buskin</HI> and <HI>Masque</HI> to their
true Origin, we shall now be able to give a Reason for a Fact, which hath
hitherto been regarded as merely the Effect of Whim and Caprice. THESPIS and
his <HI>Com∣pany</HI> bedaubed their Faces with the <HI>Lees</HI> of
<HI>Wine.</HI> Whence arose this Practice, seemingly so wild? THESPIS and
<PB N="120" REF="123"/> his <HI>Company</HI> were the Votaries of BACCHUS, and
exhibited his Exploits, and sung his Praises to their Countrymen: Their
use of the <HI>Lees</HI> of <HI>Wine,</HI> therefore, was intended as the
Means of compleating the <HI>Resemblance</HI> of their <HI>drunken God</HI>
and his <HI>Crew.</HI></P>
<P N="26">26. "As their <HI>tragic Poets</HI> were <HI>Singers,</HI>
so they were <HI>Actors,</HI> and generally performed some capital Part, in
their own Pieces for the Stage." This Fact hath gene∣rally been held
extraordinary and unaccountable: And hath been resolved, it seems, by
some Talkers on this Sub∣ject, into the <HI>Want</HI> of <HI>Actors</HI> in
the <HI>early</HI> Periods. We now clearly discover a contrary Cause: The
Practice took Place when the <HI>highest</HI> Characters were <HI>proud</HI>
to signalize themselves as <HI>Actors:</HI> When Legislators and Bards
as∣sumed the <HI>Lyrist's</HI> and <HI>Actor's</HI> Character, as the
Means of civilizing their surrounding Tribe: Therefore, till some
extraordinary Change in Manners and Principles should ensue, the original
Union established by Nature and Custom was of course maintained in
GREECE. SOPHOCLES was the first on Record who quitted this honourable Employ:
And He, only because his Voice was unequal to the Vast∣ness of the
<HI>Athenian</HI> Stage. That he quitted it on this Principle alone, appears
from his Conduct on other Oc∣casions: For he not only <HI>Sung</HI> his
<HI>own</HI> Verses, but likewise <HI>led</HI> the <HI>Dance</HI> at a
public Triumph<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>ATHEN. <HI>Deipn.</HI> l.

<P N="27">27. "MUSICAL <HI>Contests</HI> were admitted as public
Ex∣ercises in the <HI>Grecian</HI> States." For the Truth of This, we have
the concurrent Evidence of many ancient Wri∣ters. That Union of
<HI>Gymnastic</HI> and <HI>musical</HI> Exercises which took Place in the
early Periods of the <HI>Greek</HI> Repub∣lics, <PB N="121" REF="124"/> hath by
some Writers been regarded as <HI>unnatural:</HI> by all, as
<HI>accidental.</HI> Thus a learned Author says, 
<Q REND="inline">"To these <HI>Gymnastic</HI> Exercises were
added others of a quite <HI>different Nature</HI><NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>POTTER <HI>Arch. Graec.</HI></BIBL></NOTE>."</Q> But by
following this Establish∣ment up to its first Principles, we have now
found, that in Fact the <HI>Gymnastic</HI> Exercises were originally a
<HI>Part</HI> of the <HI>musical</HI><NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>See
above, Art. 19.</BIBL></NOTE>, being no more than the improved <HI>Dance,</HI>
which was a Branch of ancient <HI>Music.</HI> In Process of Time, as hath
been proved, the <HI>Dance</HI> or <HI>Gymnastic</HI> Art was gene∣rally
separated from the <HI>Melody</HI> and <HI>Song:</HI> But it is re∣markable,
that in all their public Games or Contests, from the earliest to the
latest Periods, these several Branches of Music, either separate or
in Union, composed the essential Parts of their public Exhibitions.</P>

Rise and Progress of the Pythian Games; which entirely coincides with the

<Q REND="inline">"In ancient Times, there was a Contest of
Musicians, who sung Paeans in Celebration of the God APOLLO. This was
established at DELPHI, after the <HI>Crissaean</HI> War."</Q>—So
far, we see, the musical Contest maintained its original Savage Form,
without any Separation of the Dance. 
<Q REND="inline">"Afterwards, the <HI>Amphictyons,</HI> under
EURY∣LOCHUS, instituted the <HI>equestrian</HI> and <HI>gymnastic</HI>
Contest; appointing a Crown as the Conqueror's Reward: And these Games were
called the <HI>Pythian</HI><NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>STRABO,
ib.</BIBL></NOTE>."</Q> Here, we see, in a later Period, the
Establishment assumed its political Form; a Separation ensued; the
<HI>Dance</HI> was heightened into the <HI>Gymnastic</HI> Art, for the
Reasons assigned above.</P>
<P><PB N="122" REF="125"/>We have already seen the Form of this
musical Contest, as described by STRABO<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Art. 19.</BIBL></NOTE>. We have observed, that other
ancient Authors, with great Shew of Probability, deduce its Origin from APOLLO
himself<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Ibid.</BIBL></NOTE>. SCALIGER,
speaking of the Rise of these <HI>Pythian</HI> Games, makes no Doubt of
their having been instituted by APOLLO<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot"><BIBL><HI>Poet.</HI> l. i. c. 23.</BIBL></NOTE>. But not knowing
the true Origin of the <HI>Gymnastic</HI> Art, as having originally made a
Part of the <HI>musical,</HI> and supposing (according to the common
System) that these Games were established as an <HI>imitative
Memorial</HI> of the <HI>particular Action</HI> performed, he adds with great
Candour, 
<Q REND="inline">"I won∣der, considering that he killed the
<HI>Python</HI> with an <HI>Arrow,</HI> that he did not institute a
<HI>Contention</HI> of <HI>Archers,</HI> rather than <HI>Musicians</HI><NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Ibid</BIBL></NOTE>."</Q> This Doubt, so candidly
expressed, throws new Light upon the Question; and is a collateral
Circumstance of Proof, that these Games had their Origin in the savage
<HI>Song-Feast,</HI> which in aftertimes branched out into the
<HI>Gymnastic</HI> Arts.</P>
<P>So much concerning the Rise and Progress of the
<HI>Py∣thian</HI> Games; which sufficiently clears our Subject. As to the
Origin and Progress of the Olympic Games, it is much hid in the Darkness of
distant Ages. They are generally ascribed to the <HI>Idaean</HI> HERCULES,
who is said to have given them the Name of <HI>Olympic.</HI> But if we attend
to Arguments of Probability, arising from the Analogy of Names, we shall
rather be led to attribute their In∣stitution to the <HI>Olympian</HI>
JUPITER; especially, as Tra∣dition supports this Conjecture at least as
strongly as the other. For PAUSANIAS informs us, that 
<Q REND="inline">"there are <PB N="123" REF="126"/> who say, that
JUPITER contended for Empire with SATURN, in this very Place: Others affirm,
that having vanquished the <HI>Titans,</HI> He (JUPITER) instituted these
Games, in which others too are said to have been Con∣querors; that APOLLO
vanquished MERCURY in the <HI>Race,</HI> and overcame MARS at
<HI>boxing</HI><NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>PAUSANIAS, l.
v.</BIBL></NOTE>."</Q> All this agrees so entirely with the Character and
Contentions of savage Chieftains, as to create a strong Probability of the
Truth of the Tradition. This we know, however, that Musical Contests made
an essential Part of these magnifi∣cent Exhibitions; and that PINDAR
sung his Odes, and was often <HI>crowned</HI> as <HI>Victor</HI> in these
public Contests.</P>
<P>The <HI>Isthmian</HI> and <HI>Nemean</HI> Games, having been
instituted in later Periods, when a Separation of the Dance had been already
made, and consequently the <HI>Gymnastic</HI> Arts already established,
we cannot properly draw any Conclusions from These, relative to the
present Question.</P>
<P>The <HI>tragic Contests,</HI> which followed on the Improve∣ment
of that Species of Poetry, are too well known to need any particular
Delineation. Let it suffice, that we have traced them up to their first
rude Form and Origin, in the musical Contest at DELPHI, as described by
STRA∣BO<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>See above, Art. 19.</BIBL></NOTE>. They
were re-established in their more improved State by CIMON, when that
General brought the Remains of THESEUS to ATHENS. The three great tragic Bards,
ESCHYLUS, SOPHOCLES, and EURIPIDES, all <HI>contended</HI> and were
<HI>crowned</HI> by turns.</P>
<P>This general Establishment of musical Contests, which hath
been so often held trifling and unaccountable, appears 
<PB N="124" REF="127" MS="y"/> now to have been founded in true Policy and
Wisdom. 
<Q REND="inline">"For as the leading Articles of their Religion,
Morals, and Polity, made a Part of their public Songs; so, pub∣lic Contests
of this Kind were justly regarded as the surest Means of keeping up an
Emulation of a most use∣ful Nature; and of strengthening the State, by
inforcing the fundamental Principles of Society, in the most agree∣able,
most striking, and most effectual Manner."</Q></P>
<P N="28">28. "The Profession of <HI>Bard</HI> or
<HI>Musician</HI> was held as very <HI>honourable,</HI> and of high
Esteem." We have seen the Foundation of This, in the fifteenth Article of
the present Section. For he was vested with a Kind of public Character; and
if not an original Legislator, was at least a subordinate and useful
Servant of the State: And as the Utility of his Profession was such as
arose from <HI>Genius,</HI> personal Respect and Honour was the natural
Consequence in a <HI>well ordered Republic.</HI> The Facts which support
this Truth, with regard to ancient GREECE, are commonly known, from the
<HI>Crowns, Triumphs,</HI> and other Marks of public and appointed Regard,
bestowed on the <HI>Victors</HI> in the musical Contests.</P>
<P N="29">29. "ODES and <HI>Hymns</HI> made a Part of their domestic
En∣tertainment; and the Chiefs were proud to signalize them∣selves, by
their Skill in <HI>Melody</HI> and <HI>Song.</HI>"—This is gene∣rally
known; and needs no particular Proof. It is introduc∣ed here, that it may be
accounted for: Because it hath been held a Practice unworthy the Character of
<HI>Legislators</HI> and <HI>Heroes,</HI> to be ambitious of
<HI>singing</HI> and <HI>playing</HI> on the Lyre. But if we examine the
Nature of the ancient Songs of GREECE, we shall find that the Performance of
them was worthy of the highest Characters. It was usual for all 
<PB N="125" REF="128" MS="y"/> who were at their Entertainments, first to
sing together the Praises of the Gods<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>PLUT.
<HI>Symp.</HI> l. i. q. i. ATHEN. <HI>Deip.</HI> l. xv.</BIBL></NOTE>: Then
they sung successively, one by one, holding a Branch of <HI>Myrtle</HI>
in their Hand, which was sent round the Table<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>PLUT. ib.</BIBL></NOTE>. In later Times, when the
<HI>Lyre</HI> came more into Use, <HI>this</HI> Instrument was sent round
instead of the <HI>Myrtle</HI>; and in this Period it was, that their Songs
assumed the Name of <HI>Scolia</HI><NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>PLUT. ib.
ATHEN. ib.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P>The Songs were chiefly of the three great Classes,
<HI>religious, political,</HI> and <HI>moral.</HI> Of the first Class,
ATHE∣NAEUS hath preserved no less than five: One to PALLAS, one to CERES,
one to APOLLO, one to PAN, and one to all the tutelary Gods of ATHENS<NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>ATHEN. ib.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P>Of the second Class, the <HI>political,</HI> in which their
<HI>Heroes</HI> were celebrated, though not advanced to the Rank of
<HI>Gods,</HI> the same Author hath given us several; in which, AJAX,
TELAMON, HARMODIUS, the <HI>Heroes</HI> who fell at LEIPSY∣DRION, ADMETUS, the
<HI>Olympic</HI> Victors, and others, were celebrated at their private
Entertainments<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>ATHEN. ib.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P>Of the third or <HI>moral</HI> Class ATHENAEUS hath likewise
transmitted to us a Collection. Of this Kind we find one upon the
<HI>Vanity</HI> and <HI>Mischiefs</HI> of <HI>Riches,</HI> one upon
<HI>Pru∣dence,</HI> one upon the comparative Excellence of the <HI>Goods</HI>
of Life; one upon <HI>Friendship,</HI> one upon the <HI>Choice</HI> of
<HI>Friends,</HI> one upon <HI>false Friends</HI>; and a fine one of
ARIS∣TOTLE on the <HI>Force of Virtue,</HI> which may be said in some
Measure to comprehend all the three Kinds, <HI>religious, political,</HI> and
<HI>Moral.</HI><NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>ATHEN. ib.</BIBL></NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="126" REF="129" MS="y"/>Such being the Nature of the old
<HI>Grecian Songs,</HI> and the whole Nation having been prepared to perform
and listen to them with Reverence by a correspondent Education; no Wonder
that the highest Characters in the Commonwealth bore a Part in their
Performance at private Entertainments: 
<Q REND="inline">"For their Songs being enriched with the great and
im∣portant Subjects relative to their public State, and being the
<HI>established Vehicle</HI> of <HI>Religion, Morals,</HI> and
<HI>Polity</HI>; nothing could be more suitable to a high Station in the
Commonwealth, than a Proficiency in this <HI>sublime</HI> and
<HI>legislative Art.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P N="30">30. "When <HI>Music</HI> had attained to this State of
relative <HI>Perfection,</HI> it was esteemed a <HI>necessary
Accomptishment:</HI> And an Ignorance in this Art was regarded as a capital
Defect." Of this we have an Instance, even in THE∣MISTOCLES himself, who
was upbraided with his Igno∣rance in Music<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>CICERO <HI>Tusc.</HI> l. i.</BIBL></NOTE>. The whole
Country of <HI>Cynaethe</HI> laboured under a parallel Reproach<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>ATHENAEUS, POLYBIUS.</BIBL></NOTE>: And all the enormous
<HI>Crimes</HI> committed there, were attributed by the neighbouring States to
the <HI>Neglect</HI> of <HI>Music.</HI>—What Wonder? For according to
the Delineation here given of the ancient Greek Music, their Ignorance in
this noble Art implied a general Deficiency in the three great Articles of a
social Education, <HI>Religion, Morals,</HI> and <HI>Polity.</HI></P>
<P N="31">31. "The Genius of their Music varied along with their
Manners." Of this Truth we have had abundant Proofs, in the Course of this
Dissertation; where we have seen Music (in its ancient and inlarged
Sense) emerge from the Rudeness of barbarous Life, and improve through 
<PB N="127" REF="130" MS="y"/> the successive Periods of improving
Manners. We shall soon see a parallel Decline of this noble Art,
arising from an equivalent Cause: For Manners being the leading and 
<Q REND="inline">"most essential Quality of Man, All his other
Tastes and Acquirements naturally correspond with These; and accommodate
themselves to his Manners, as to their original Cause."</Q></P>
<P N="32">32. "As every Change of Manners influenced their Music,
so by a reciprocal Action, every considerable Change of Music influenced
their Manners." The Facts which prove this, will be given in the thirty fourth
Ar∣ticle. In the mean Time, the Reason is evident: For not only the
Passion for <HI>Novelty</HI> and <HI>Change</HI> was immediately dangerous
to the <HI>Stability</HI> of <HI>small Republics</HI>; but still farther,
as <HI>Music</HI> was the established <HI>Vehicle</HI> of all the great
Principles of <HI>Education,</HI> a Change in <HI>Music</HI> inevitably
brought on a Change in <HI>These.</HI></P>
<P N="33">33. "There was a provident Community, of Principles
uncommonly severe, which fixed the Subjects and Move∣ments of Song and Dance,
by Law." This provident Community was that of SPARTA. The Practice was not
peculiar to this wise though barbarous Commonwealth. It was borrowed from
CRETE; and came originally from EGYPT; where the same provident Institution
had taken Place in earlier Ages.—In that great Fountain of ancient
Polity, not only the Art of <HI>Music</HI> in its inlarged Sense, but even
that of <HI>Painting,</HI> was fixed and made unalterable by Law<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>PLATO <HI>de Legibus,</HI> l. ii.</BIBL></NOTE>. PLATO, who
informs us of This, gives a par∣ticular Detail of the musical
Establishment, which sets the Principle in a clear Light, and
corroborates what is here <PB N="128" REF="131" MS="y"/> advanced. 
<Q REND="inline">"All their Songs and Dances are consecrated to the
Gods: It is ordained, what Sacrifices shall be offered to each Deity, and
what <HI>Songs</HI> and <HI>Choirs</HI> shall be appointed to each Sacrifice:

fatal indeed to <HI>Art,</HI> but excellent with Respect to the Stability and

Innovations were attempted by three diffe∣rent Musicians, TERPANDER,
TIMOTHEUS, and PHRYN∣NIS<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>ATHEN. <HI>Deip.</HI> l.

against one of these Incroachers on the severe Simplicity of the
Commonwealth is yet preserved; it may not be dis∣agreeable to the Reader,
to present him with this curious Remnant of Antiquity. 
<Q REND="inline">"Whereas TIMOTHEUS the <HI>Milesian,</HI> coming
into our City, and despising the ancient Music; rejecting also that
Melody which ariseth from seven Strings; and setting off his Music by a
Multiplicity of Strings, and a new Species of Melody, corrupts the Ears of our
Youth; and instead of That which is legiti∣mate and pure, corrupting the
<HI>Enharmonic</HI> by new, various, and <HI>Chromatic</HI> Sounds; and being
called to the <HI>Eleusinian</HI> Mysteries, did divulge the Secrets of
that Insti∣tution; <PB N="129" REF="132" MS="y"/>—It seemed good to
the <HI>Senate</HI> and <HI>Rhetors,</HI> that TIMOTHEUS should be called to
Account for these Pro∣ceedings; that he should be compelled to cut off the
four superfluous Strings from his Lyre, leaving the seven ancient Tones;
and that he be banished to a Distance from the City; that hence forward
none may dare to introduce any new and dangerous Custom into SPARTA; lest
the Honour of our musical Contests should be de∣filed<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>ARATI PHAENOMENA, <HI>Ed. Oxon.</HI> at the End of which
this Edict is preserved.</BIBL></NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>In this Edict, we see the jealous Spirit of a Republic, which
could only subsist by a rigorous Simplicity of Man∣ners, and an
unalterable Obedience to its Laws. There hath been much ill-founded Ridicule
thrown on the <HI>Spartans</HI> for this Decision: For if we consider the
danger∣ous Effects of mere <HI>Innovation</HI> in <HI>small Republics,</HI>
and the close Connexion between the <HI>Melody</HI> and the <HI>Subject</HI>
in ancient <HI>Music,</HI> together with the early and continued Ap∣plication
of <HI>These</HI> to the <HI>Education</HI> of their Youth, we shall find,
that in this Instance the <HI>Spartans</HI> only acted a cautious and
consistent Part. Their Principle was, to admit <HI>no Change</HI> in
<HI>Manners,</HI> and therefore <HI>no Change</HI> in <HI>Music.</HI> The
designed Innovation of TIMOTHEUS, therefore, would have destroyed the
first leading Principle, the very Genius of their Republic; and,
consequently, must have been fatal to the Republic itself.</P>
<P N="34">34. "In the Commonwealths which were of more li∣bertine and
relaxed Principles, and particularly in that of ATHENS, the Corruption of
Manners brought on the Corruption of Music; and this Corruption of Music 
<PB N="130" REF="133" MS="y"/> still farther corrupted Manners; the
Musicians, Bards, or Poets, being the immediate Instruments of the
Cor∣ruption." This mutual Influence of Manners and Mu∣sic on each other hath
been already explained in two pre∣ceding Articles<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Art. 31, 32.</BIBL></NOTE>. And the Truth of these
Reasonings is confirmed by Facts, which PLATO gives us at large, in the
following most remarkable Passage.</P>
<Q>"The People (of ATHENS) did not in former Times controul the Laws,
but willingly obeyed them. I mean those Laws which were made concerning
Music. For Music was then precisely distinguished into its several
Kinds: One was appropriated to the Supplication and Praises of the Gods:
These were called <HI>Hymns.</HI> An∣other Species was the lamenting or
pathetic: A third was the <HI>Paean</HI> or Song of Triumph: A fourth was the
<HI>Dithyrambic</HI>; and a fifth consisted in singing ancient
<HI>Laws</HI> or <HI>Proverbs</HI><NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>See Art.
6.</BIBL></NOTE>. In These and other Subjects established by Law, it was
not allowed to use one Kind of Melody instead of another: Each Kind had its
par∣ticular Appropriation. The Power of deciding on These, and of condemning
in Case of Disobedience, was not committed to the Hisses and foolish
Clamours of the Multitude, as is now the Practice: Neither was the Liberty of
intemperate Praise allowed to a noisy Croud: This Decision was left to
Men distinguished by their Sense and Knowledge; and a general Silence was
maintained, till they had heard the Conclusion of the Work. The young Men,
their Governors, and all the People, were obedient to the Motions of a Wand.
While this good Order was maintained, the Multitude 
<PB N="131" REF="134" MS="y"/> willingly obeyed, nor dared to decide any thing
in a tumultuous Manner. But in Course of Time, the Poets themselves were
accessary to a fatal Change in Music: They wanted not Genius; but had no
Regard to what was just and legitimate; running into Extravagance, and too
much indulging the Vein of Pleasure. Hence they confounded all the several
Kinds together; affirm∣ing that <HI>mere Taste</HI> and <HI>Pleasure,</HI>
whether it were that of a <HI>good</HI> or a <HI>wicked</HI> Man, was the only
<HI>Criterion</HI> of <HI>Music.</HI> In Consequence of this, they
composed their <HI>Poems</HI> on the same Principle; and thus rendered the
<HI>Multitude</HI> so <HI>bold</HI> and <HI>daring</HI> against the
<HI>established Music,</HI> that they assumed to themselves the
sole Right of de∣ciding on it. Hence the Theatres began to be in Up∣roar,
where formerly Silence had reigned: And thus the Privilege of <HI>judging</HI>
fell from the <HI>Rulers</HI> of the State to the <HI>Dregs</HI> of the People.
Had this Authority been assumed by the <HI>liberal</HI> Part of the City,
no great Harm had followed: But now, from this <HI>corrupt Change</HI> in
<HI>Music,</HI> a <HI>general Licentiousness</HI> of <HI>Opinion</HI>
hath ensued.—The Consequence of this hath been, that we no longer are
disposed to obey the Magistrate: Hence too, that other Evil flows, that
we despise the Authority and Precepts of our Parents, and the Advice and
Wisdom of Old Age. And as we are rising towards the Extreme of this
Corruption, we now refuse Obedience to the Laws: And to fill up the Measure
of our Iniquities, all <HI>Religion</HI> and mutual <HI>Faith</HI> are
<HI>lost</HI> among us<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>De Legibus, <HI>l.
iii.</HI></BIBL></NOTE>."</Q>
<P>Such is the Picture which the philosophic PLATO hath lest of his
Time and Country: A Picture too well con∣firmed <PB N="132" REF="135"/> by the
concurrent Testimony of XENOPHON<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>See below,
Sect. vii. Art. 5.</BIBL></NOTE>, in whose Accounts, together with those of
PLUTARCH<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>See ib.</BIBL></NOTE>, we shall soon
see a particular Delineation of the Progress of this Evil, which PLATO here
describes in general Terms.</P>
<P>Let us conclude this Article with the Explanation of Subjects which
hath not hitherto been clearly treated of, for want of a just Idea of the
ancient <HI>Greek Music.</HI> The learned VOSSIUS thus expresseth
himself: 
<Q REND="inline">"It is a doubtful Point, whether we should say,
that on a Change of Music, a Change of Manners ensues; or that a Change of
Manners produceth a Change in Music: The first was DAMON's Opinion which
PLATO follows: But CICERO leans to the latter System<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>VOSSIUS.</BIBL></NOTE>."</Q> On this Passage it is
necessary first to observe, that both VOSSIUS and CICERO use the Word
<HI>Music</HI> in its <HI>modern</HI> Acceptation, as implying mere
<HI>Melody.</HI> No Wonder, therefore, if they had but an imperfect
Comprehension of PLATO's Argu∣ment. Secondly, On the Principles delivered in
this Dis∣sertation, it will appear, that PLATO was of both these
Opinions, 
<Q REND="inline">"That Manners influenced Music, and Music
influenced Manners."</Q> In the Passage which VOSSIUS refers to, where the
Opinion of DAMON is delivered, PLATO speaks of a Change in Music as
influencing the Manners of a Commonwealth: This Change he regards, as opening a
Door for Confusion and Novelty in an Affair of public Consequence;
similar to a Neglect of Reverence to old Men, Parents, or Magistrates, or
any other ancient and approved Customs that were connected with the public
Welfare: and in this Respect, the Influence of the Greek 
<PB N="133" REF="136" MS="y"/> Music, as now explained, on the Manners of
Mankind is too evident to need any farther Proof.</P>
<P>On the other Hand, it is no less evident, that PLATO was of
Opinion, that a Corruption of Manners must cor∣rupt Music. He hath shewn
us in the Passage given above, that the Boldness and Degeneracy of the
People of ATHENS first allured the Poets to debase their Art, by singing
such Poems as were accommodated to their vicious Taste founded on their
vicious Manners: That as Man∣ners had thus debased Music, so this corrupt
Music by a natural Reaction still farther corrupted Manners, and
com∣pleated the Destruction of Religion and Virtue.</P>
<P N="35">35. "In Consequence of these Progressions, a gradual
and total Separation of the Bard's complex Character ensued. The Leader of
the State no longer was ambi∣tious of the musical Art; nor the Poet
descended to the Profession of Lyrist, Singer, or Actor: Because
these Professions, which in the earliest Ages had been the Means of
inculcating every thing laudable and great, grew by Degrees of less and
less Importance; and being at length perverted to the contrary Purposes,
were in the End disdained by the wise and virtuous." These gra∣dual
Separations of the several Branches of the Bard's complex Office, and of
Melody, Dance, and Song, are not incurious in their Progression.—We
have seen, that in the <HI>earliest</HI> Ages, the <HI>Gods</HI> or
<HI>Legislators</HI> themselves assumed the full and complex Character;
that they were <HI>Poets, Lyrists, Singers</HI> and <HI>Dancers.</HI> The
<HI>Dance</HI> seems first to have been se∣pated from the <HI>Melody</HI>
and <HI>Song,</HI> being soon heightened into the <HI>Gymnastic</HI> Art.
The <HI>Legislators</HI> by Degrees quitted the several Parts of the
<HI>Musician's</HI> Character; a Separation which 
<PB N="134" REF="137" MS="y"/> naturally arose from decreasing
Enthusiasm, and increasing Cares of Government. As LINUS and ORPHEUS were
the first, so PYTHAGORAS and SOLON seem to have been the last, who
<HI>composed</HI> Songs and <HI>sung</HI> them to the sur∣rounding
People.—The Profession of <HI>Bard</HI> or <HI>Musician</HI> was
now become a <HI>secondary,</HI> but <HI>respectable</HI> Character, as
being an Assistant to the Magistrate, and an useful Servant of the
State, a Teacher of Religion and Morals. The Bard <HI>sung</HI> and
<HI>played</HI> always, and led the <HI>Dance</HI> occasion∣ally: But when
HOMER's Poems had eclipsed every other Epic Strain, another Separation
followed: The <HI>Rhapsodists</HI> arose in GREECE: They sung HOMER's
Poems to large surrounding Audiences: They were strictly his
<HI>Represen∣tatives,</HI> who now gave his Poems to the People, with that
poetic Fire and Rapture which the Bard himself had possessed and
exerted: For in PLATO's <HI>Ion,</HI> the <HI>Rhapsodist</HI> says, that 
<Q REND="inline">"when he sings a piteous Tale, his Eyes swim
with Tears; when he sings a terrible Event, his Heart beats, and his Hair
stands erect."</Q> In the earlier Ages of Tragedy, the Poet both acted and
sung: But in the Time of SOPHOCLES, another Separation, parallel to the
last, ensued; and the Province of <HI>Actor</HI> began to be di∣stinct
from that of <HI>Poet.</HI>—Soon after this Time, we find in the
Passage quoted above from PLATO, that a Separa∣tion of the <HI>whole</HI>
Art of <HI>Music</HI> from its <HI>proper Ends</HI> took Place at ATHENS: Its
salutary Effects were now lost: and as at this Period the Passion for
illiberal <HI>Comedy</HI> came on, so we learn from the concurrent
Testimony of PLU∣TARCH<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot"><BIBL><HI>Sympos.</HI> l.
vii.</BIBL></NOTE> and other Authors<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>JUSTIN, l.
vi.</BIBL></NOTE>, that the Exhibition of <PB N="135" REF="138" MS="y"/>
<HI>Tragedy</HI> at ATHENS had now degenerated into mere <HI>Pomp</HI> and
<HI>Shew,</HI> equally expensive and pernicious. The same respectable
Ancient assures us, that the <HI>Dance,</HI> which had formerly been
separated from the <HI>Song</HI> for warlike Pur∣poses, was now corrupted
by the <HI>Mimes</HI> in a very extra∣ordinary Degree<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot"><BIBL><HI>Sympos.</HI> l. ix. qu. 15.</BIBL></NOTE>. The
Consequence of these Corrup∣tions soon shewed themselves in a
subsequent Period: Hence, in the Age of PLATO, another Separation had come
on: For now the complex Name of <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>
or <HI>Bard</HI> was disused; and that of
<GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> or <HI>Poet</HI> had assumed
its Place: And as the <HI>Legislator's</HI> Office had formerly been
separated from the <HI>Bard's</HI>; so now, in Consequence of this
Corruption, and as a natural Effect of Music's sinking into a mere
<HI>Amusement,</HI> the <HI>Poet's</HI> Character became quite distinct
from that of <HI>Chorist, Actor,</HI> or <HI>Dancer,</HI> and these
distinct from each other<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>PLATO <HI>de
Repub.</HI> l. ii.</BIBL></NOTE>. For the <HI>moral</HI> End being now
<HI>forgot,</HI> and nothing but <HI>Amusement</HI> attended to, a higher
Proficiency in these Arts became necessary, and consequently a more
severe Application to each.—We must now go back a little, to catch
the Rise of another Separation: An Inroad was made into the Muse's
Terri∣tories: The public musical Contentions admitted <HI>Prose,</HI> as an
Aspirant to the Palm originally due to <HI>Poetry</HI> and <HI>Song.</HI>
HERODOTUS was the first who was crowned for <HI>writing</HI> and
<HI>speaking</HI> (or more properly for <HI>singing) History</HI> at the
public Contest<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>LUCIAN,
HERODOTUS.</BIBL></NOTE>: And it is remarkable, that al∣though He brought down
the <HI>Song</HI> to the <HI>prosaic</HI> Manner, yet still his Work
retained the <HI>fabulous Air,</HI> as well as the <PB N="136" REF="139"/>
<HI>Appellation</HI> of the <HI>Muses:</HI> All which Circumstances,
con∣sidered in Union, may lead us to the true <HI>poetic</HI> and
<HI>fabling</HI> Genius of his celebrated History. THUCIDIDES hints at this
Practice in the Beginning of his noble Work<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>L. i.
c. 6.</BIBL></NOTE>: Declar∣ing, that he means it not as a mere Exercise for
the <HI>public Contest</HI>; but as a valuable Possession for
<HI>After-Ages.</HI> In later Times it became a common Practice for
<HI>Sophists</HI> and <HI>Rhetoricians</HI> to contend in <HI>Prose,</HI>
at the <HI>Olympic</HI> Games, for the Crown of Glory<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>LUCIAN <HI>de Salt.</HI></BIBL></NOTE>.—The
<HI>Delphic Oracles</HI> kept Pace with these progressive Separations: In
the early Periods they were delivered by the <HI>Pythia,</HI> with frantic
Gesture <HI>(Dance) Melody,</HI> and <HI>Rythm</HI><NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Above, Art. 8.</BIBL></NOTE>. In a succeeding Age, we find
the <HI>Pythia</HI> hath quitted her complex Cha∣racter; <HI>Poets</HI> are
appointed for the Service of the Tem∣ple, and turn the <HI>Oracles</HI> into
<HI>Verse:</HI> But in the later Times, this Practice had also ceased;
and the <HI>Oracles</HI> were given in plain Prose<NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>STRABO, l. ix. CICERO <HI>de Div.</HI> l.
ii.</BIBL></NOTE>.—In the Days of ARIS∣TOTLE, a general and almost a
total Separation had taken Place. The Art of playing on the <HI>Lyre,</HI>
which had been the <HI>Glory</HI> of their early <HI>Legislators,</HI> was
now regarded as a <HI>Reproach</HI> to a young <HI>King:</HI> The Art of
<HI>singing,</HI> which had once been a distinguishing Attribute of their
<HI>Gods,</HI> was now reckoned an ignoble Practice for a <HI>Man</HI><NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>ARISTOT. <HI>Polit.</HI> l. viii. c. 5.</BIBL></NOTE>:
The <HI>Chorus</HI> of some of their Dramas gave Way to <HI>Melody</HI>
merely <HI>instru∣mental,</HI> which now first assumed the Name of
<HI>Music:</HI> The <HI>Rhapsodists</HI> had, about this Time, begun to
quit a Part of <HI>Their</HI> Profession; and instead of
<HI>singing,</HI> often <HI>recited</HI> <PB N="137" REF="140" MS="y"/>
HOMER's Poems<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>ARISTOT. <HI>Poet.</HI> c.
26.</BIBL></NOTE>. To conclude all, the great Master-Critic and Politician of
GREECE, viewing Music in that corrupt State which it held in his own Time,
though he still asserts its Use in private Education, gives up the
public Musical Exhibitions, as only fit to gratify the Taste of an
abandoned people<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot"><BIBL><HI>Polit.</HI> l. viii. c.
7.</BIBL></NOTE>. But in the later Period when PLUTARCH writ, its Utility had
vanished even in private Life: For He declares, that <HI>Music,</HI> which
had formerly been so important and salutary in its Effects, was now be∣come
a mere Amusement of the Theatre, and no longer applied to the Education of
Youth<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><BIBL><HI>De Musica.</HI></BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P N="36">36. "Hence the Power, the Dignity, and Utility of
<HI>Music</HI> sunk into a general Corruption and Contempt." This is a
Consequence too manifest to need a Proof.—And thus we have attempted
to unfold the Nature, Rise, Progress, Power, Perfection, and Corruption, of
MUSIC in ancient GREECE; from the earliest Times, when it was the
<HI>Glory</HI> of their <HI>Legislators,</HI> down to the later Periods when
it became the <HI>Employment</HI> of their <HI>Slaves.</HI></P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="7" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. VII. Of the Origin and Progression of Comedy in ancient
GREECE.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is one considerable Branch of the MUSIC of antient GREECE, I
mean COMEDY, the Rise and Progression of which, together with their
Causes, have been designedly passed in Silence: Because, if this
Disquisition had been mixed with what hath been <PB N="138" REF="141"/>
delivered concerning the <HI>Ode, Epic,</HI> and <HI>Tragedy,</HI> the Chain of
Argument would have been broken; and that Order and Clearness destroyed,
which it was necessary to preserve as much as possible in this
involved Subject.</P>
<P>Let us now proceed, therefore, to reduce the Origin and Progress
of the <HI>Greek Comedy</HI> to their natural and essential
Causes.—To point out the Rise of this Poem from savage Life; to
unfold the true Reasons why it was so late in taking its legitimate Form in
GREECE; and then to ex∣plain, on what Foundation the <HI>old, middle,</HI> and
<HI>new</HI> Comedy, appeared in their respective
<HI>Successions.</HI></P>
<P>In the Description of the savage Song Feasts, given above from
LAFITAU, it appears that these warlike Tribes 
<Q REND="inline">"are still quicker at rallying, than at
praising, each other. He who dances, takes whomsoever he pleaseth by the
Hand; and brings him forth into the midst of the Assem∣bly; to which he
yields without Resistance. Mean while the Dancer continued to
<HI>sing,</HI> and sometimes in his Song, and sometimes in the intervals,
he throws his Sarcasms on the Patient, who hears him without Re∣ply.—At
every <HI>bon Mot,</HI> loud Peals of Laughter arise along the Galleries, who
animate this Sport, and often oblige the Patient to cover his Head in his
Mantle<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>See above, Sect.
ii.</BIBL></NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>Now, if we again suppose, as we have already done, that the
Use of <HI>Letters</HI> should come among these savage Tribes, and be
cultivated with that spirit which is natural to a free and active People;
from this Picture, as given by LAFITAU, the following Consequences would
naturally arise.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="139" REF="142"/>1. "Their casual Strokes of Raillery
would improve into written Invectives, which would occasionally be sung by
their sarcastic Choirs." Because nothing could be more alluring to a
People of this satyric Turn, than such a Repository of Wit and Raillery;
which, like a Quiver stored with the keenest Arrows, would be ever at Hand,
ready to be discharged against the occasional Objects of their
Resentment.</P>
<P N="2">2. "Narrative or Epic Poems of the <HI>invective</HI> or
<HI>comic</HI> Kind would likewise arise, and be occasionally sung at
their public Festivals." For the Spirit of Sarcasm being once awakened, it
would of course proceed from occasional Strokes of Raillery, to the Recital
of ridiculous Actions, for the Gratification and Entertainment of a lively and
satyric People.</P>
<P N="3">3. "From these two Species (the <HI>choral</HI> and
<HI>narrative</HI> united) the first rude Outline of <HI>Comedy</HI> would
arise." We have seen how <HI>Tragedy</HI> arose from parallel Causes:
And These would naturally take Place in producing <HI>Comedy.</HI> For the
<HI>Narrative,</HI> already animated by Action, would easily slide into
dramatic Representation, as in the Rise of <HI>Tragedy</HI>; and the
correspondent <HI>Peals of Laughter</HI> (by the Assistance of written
Invectives) would assume the Form of a <HI>comic Choir.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. "While the salutary Principles of Legislation should
prevail, Comedy thus formed, would be little encouraged by the Leaders of the
State." For the grander Kinds of Poetry, already treated of, containing the
Principles of Religion, Polity, and Morals, would draw their main Attention;
while their Comedy, being no more than the <PB N="140" REF="143" MS="y"/>
Vehicle of Ridicule and vague Invective, would (at most) be only
<HI>endured</HI> by prudent Legislators.</P>
<P N="5">5. "A provident Community, of Principles uncom∣monly severe,
might even banish this Species of Poem, as destructive to their State."
Because nothing could be more dangerous to a Commonwealth established on
Severity of Manners, than the unbounded Licentiousness of Sentiment and
Speech, which this Comedy must tend to produce.</P>
<P N="6">6. "If in a State of more relaxed Principles, where such
Comedy had been tolerated, a general Corruption of Manners should take Place
among the People; and if by any means, such a corrupt People should
over∣power the Magistrates, and assume to themselves the Reins of
Government; then, this Species of Co∣medy would rise into Credit, and be
publicly esta∣blished." For the <HI>upright Leaders</HI> of the State being
<HI>deposed,</HI> and the <HI>Creatures</HI> of such a <HI>corrupt
People</HI> being seated in their <HI>Place, that Comedy</HI> would now be
<HI>authorized</HI> by Law, which was most accommodated to the
<HI>Taste</HI> and <HI>Vices</HI> of such a <HI>corrupt People.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. "The Ridicule and Invective of their Comedy, thus
established, would be pointed chiefly against those Ma∣gistrates, or
private Men, whose Qualities would be hateful to the debauched Populace." For
Corruption being now established as it were by Law; that is, by the Voice
of a degenerate People which stood in the Place of Law; the Poets would find
it necessary to gratify the People's Vices as the surest Road to
Success; and the most certain Road to this must be by the <HI>Ridicule of
Virtue.</HI></P>
<P N="8"><PB N="141" REF="144" MS="y"/>8. "If a <HI>Tyranny</HI>
should suddenly erect itself on the Ruins of such a People, it would by
its Authority <HI>silence</HI> this Species of <HI>Comedy.</HI>"—For
every thing hateful to the People being now the established Subject of the
comic Muse, the Tyrants, who had taken away the public Liberty, must expect
to become the Subject of Comedy, if permitted to revel in its former
Licentiousness.</P>
<P N="9">9. "The Poets would probably find a Subterfuge, for the
Gratification of the People; and continue to repre∣sent <HI>real
Characters</HI> under <HI>feigned Names.</HI>" For this would be the only
Species of Comedy they could pursue with a Probability of Success: And this
might be conti∣nued without much Danger, if they were cautious with Respect
to the Persons of the Tyrants.</P>
<P N="10">10. "If a great Conqueror should arise, and, by
sub∣duing a Variety of Nations, should open a Communi∣cation between such
a State and others of more luxurious and refined Manners, this
<HI>second</HI> Species of Comedy would naturally receive a
<HI>Polish</HI>; and, instead of the in∣direct personal Invective, would
assume the more deli∣cate Form of general Raillery, and become a Picture of
human Life."—For one of the first Efforts of a growing Politeness is
to avoid all Occasions of <HI>Offence</HI>; and this, without Respect to
any Consequences, either good or bad, which may affect the Public; but merely
from a selfish Regard to the Opinion of <HI>Elegance,</HI> and the Pride of
<HI>Urbanity.</HI></P>
<P>In Support of these Deductions, let us now endeavour to
<HI>realize</HI> them; by shewing, that such Consequences did arise in
GREECE: And in the Course of this Argument, the Writer hopes he shall be
able to disclose the true Causes <PB N="142" REF="145" MS="y"/> of the
Progression of the ancient Comedy, so different from that of the higher
Kinds of Poetic Composition.</P>
<P N="1">1. "In the earliest Periods of the Greek States, their
Casual Strokes of Raillery were improved into written Invectives, and were
occasionally sung by their sarcastic Choirs." These written
Invectives were in Fact so early, that all the Greek Writers with one Voice
confess themselves altogether ignorant of their Origin. Their first
Appearance is ascribed by different Authors to different Nations<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>See VOSSIUS <HI>Inst. Poët.</HI> l. ii. c.
23.</BIBL></NOTE>; and no Wonder if Evidence be wanting in Support of each
Pretence, when it is probable, that these sarcastic Choirs arose in
many of the <HI>Greek</HI> States nearly at the same Time; that is, in or
about the first Periods of Civilization and Letters. For we have seen, that
such a Period would naturally produce them: 
<Q REND="inline">"Because nothing could be more alluring to a
People of the satyric Turn, than such a Repository of Raillery and
Sarcasm."</Q> How∣ever, we must not omit to observe, that their
Traditions are much more accommodated to Nature and Probability on this
Subject, than on the Rise of the tragic Choir, which they seem generally to
have attributed to the single Prac∣tice of the drunken Votaries of
BACCHUS.</P>
<P N="2">2. "Narrative or Epic Poems of the invective or comic Kind
arose, and were occasionally sung at their public Festivals." For the
truth of this Fact we have the Testimony of ARISTOTLE, who tells us, 
<Q REND="inline">"that although we know not the names either of
these Poems or their Authors; yet there is Reason to believe that many had
been written before HOMER; and that his <HI>Margites</HI> 
<PB N="143" REF="146" MS="y"/> brought this Species to its Perfection in the
same Manner as the <HI>Iliad</HI> and <HI>Odyssey</HI> had compleated the
Form of the Epic Poem<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot"><BIBL><HI>Poët.</HI> c.
4.</BIBL></NOTE>."</Q> That HOMER, as well as other Bards of the early Periods,
sung their comic Poems at the festal Solemnities, needs no farther Proof
here.</P>
<P N="3">3. "From these two Species (the <HI>Choral</HI> and
<HI>Narrative</HI> united) the first rude Outline of Comedy arose." The
<HI>Narrative,</HI> already animated by a lively Action, did easily slide
into <HI>dramatic</HI> Representation; and the correspondent Peals of
<HI>Laughter</HI> excited among the surrounding Audience, by means of written
Invectives, assumed the Form of the <HI>comic Choir.</HI> In this Point, we
have again to contend with the general Body of Critics, from ARISTOTLE down to
the present Times, who all concur in ascribing the Rise of the legitimate
Form of Comedy to HOMER's <HI>Margites</HI>; in the same Manner as they have
ascribed the Rise of <HI>Tragedy</HI> to the <HI>Iliad</HI> and
<HI>Odyssey.</HI> But notwith∣standing this general Concurrence of
Opinion, it seems evident that the Progression of Comedy was founded in
the same Causes with that of Tragedy: That they both natu∣rally arose in
the Course of Things, from an Union of the <HI>Narration</HI> and the
<HI>Choir,</HI> without any Respect had to HO∣MER's Poems. The same
Arguments that have proved the one, will confirm the other. We see the
natural Seeds of Comedy and scenic Representation in savage Life, no
less than those of Tragedy<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>See above, Sect.
ii.</BIBL></NOTE>: Nay, even in the earliest Periods of GREECE itself, we
shall find the first rude Form of Comedy, arising from an Union of
<HI>dramatic Representation</HI> and a <HI>Choir,</HI> long before HOMER
existed. In the Account <PB N="144" REF="147"/> already cited from STRABO and
others, of the <HI>musical Contest</HI> established at DELPHI, which in
Time branched out into the <HI>Pythian</HI> Games, as we have found the first
rude Form of <HI>Tragedy</HI>; so now we shall find likewise a faint
Outline of the first rude Form of <HI>Comedy.</HI> For it appears, that
APOLLO with his Choir, and his Worshipers in after-times, not only
represented his Victory, and sung a Paean in Consequence of it (in which
Union we see the first rude Form of Tragedy) but likewise, in the Way of
Ridicule they represented the <HI>Hisses</HI> of the dying Serpent, and
sung an <HI>Invective</HI> or <HI>Sarcasm</HI> on his overthrow<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>See the Authors cited above, Sect. v. Art.
16.</BIBL></NOTE>. For so I understand the Word
<GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> and
<GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, used by these ancient
Writers on this Occasion; as implying only <HI>Sarcastic Verses,</HI> and
not <HI>Iambics</HI> in the strict Sense; which are generally believed to
have been first formed by ARCHI∣LOCHUS, many Ages after the Fact here alluded
to. And hence the true Reason appears, why the <HI>Greek</HI> Comedy was
written in <HI>Verse</HI>; because it was originally
<HI>sung.</HI>—Now, in this Union of <HI>comic Representation</HI>
and a <HI>satyrical Choir,</HI> we see the genuine, though imperfect and
<HI>rude Form</HI> of the <HI>old Greek Comedy.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. "While the salutary Principles of Legislation
pre∣vailed, Comedy, thus formed, was little encouraged by the Leaders of the
State." The Authority of ARIS∣TOTLE is clear and decisive on this Point. 
<Q REND="inline">"Comedy remained obscure and unknown, because
little Regard was had to it from the Beginning; the Magistrate being late in
appointing it a Choir."</Q> He assigns no Reason for this Conduct of the
Magistrate: But a sufficient <PB N="145" REF="148"/> Reason appears to be
given above. 
<Q REND="inline">"For the grander Kinds of Poetry containing the
Principles of Religion, Polity, and Morals, drew their main Attention; while
their Comedy, being no more than the Vehicle of Ridi∣cule and vague Invective,
was only <HI>endured</HI> by prudent Legislators."</Q> The Truth of this
Article will receive Confirmation from the two succeeding.</P>
<P N="5">5. "There was a provident Community, of Principles uncommonly
severe, which even banished this Species of Poem, as destructive to their
State." We have already seen the Providence and Caution of the
<HI>Spartans</HI> in regu∣lating their <HI>Music</HI> for the Security of
their Republic<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>See above.</BIBL></NOTE>. We
shall now see the admirable Consistency of their Conduct, with
Respect to the very Beginnings of <HI>Comedy,</HI> when it first dawned
among them in the Verses of ARCHI∣LOCHUS. 
<Q REND="inline">"The <HI>Spartans</HI> ordered the Writings of
ARCHILOCHUS to be banished from their City, because they thought the
Perusal of them was dangerous to the Purity of Manners. They did not chuse
that the Minds of their Children should be tainted with them, lest they
should more hurt their Morals, than sharpen their Wit<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>VELL. <HI>Patere.</HI> l. vi. c. 3.</BIBL>—In after
Times, when the severe Man∣ners and the Glory of this Republic sunk
together, we find its Conduct altogether correspondent with these
Principles. The <HI>Mimes,</HI> the most dissolute Species of Comedy,
were then admitted. See SUIDAS, ATHE∣NAEUS, and other Authors of the later
Periods.</NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P N="6">6. "In the Republic of ATHENS, which was of more relaxed
Principles, where this Comedy had been tolerated, a general Corruption of
Manners took Place <PB N="146" REF="149"/> among the People: The corrupt People
overpowered the Magistrates; assumed to themselves the Reins of
Government, and on this Foundation the old Comedy arose into Credit, had a
Choir appointed by the Magi∣strate, and was publicly established." This
was the natural and necessary Consequence of the Power of a corrupt
People. For the upright Magistrates being de∣posed, and the Creatures of
this corrupt People seated in their Place, <HI>that</HI> Comedy was now
authorized by Law, which was most accommodated to the Vices and Taste of a
dissolute Populace.</P>
<P>These Causes clearly account for the Establishment of the
old Comedy, at that very Period when it took Place. But as other Causes, void
of all Foundation, have been assigned for this, by various Authors; it will
be necessary to prove the Truth of the Causes here alledged, from the
Authority of the Greek Writers.</P>
<P>PLATO, in the Passage cited above<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>See Sect. v. Art. 34.</BIBL></NOTE>, gives us the History
of the Corruption of the People, and of Music; but in such general Terms,
that, without some farther Evidence, it is impossible clearly to fix the
Time when, or the Means by which, this Change was brought about, so fatal to
the Republic of <HI>Athens.</HI> It happens fortunately, that PLUTARCH hath
recorded the Event with such Particularity of Circumstance, as leaves no
Room to doubt on this Subject. PERICLES was the Man, who for his own private
Ends of Popularity, effected this ruinous Change: For 
<Q REND="inline">"By giving the People the Plunder and
Possession of the Lands taken from the Enemy, and by 
<PB N="147" REF="150"/> squandering the public Monies (formerly reserved for
the Uses of War) in SHEWS and PLAYS for their <HI>Enter∣tainment,</HI> and by
Grants of Largesses and Pensions, he changed them from a sober,
modest, and thrifty People, who maintained themselves by their own Labour,
into a riotous and debauched Multitude; and thus roused them into sedition
against the Court of the <HI>Areopagus</HI><NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>In
Pericle.</BIBL></NOTE>."</Q> From this Passage it is evident, that PERICLES
not only debauched the <HI>Athenian</HI> People; but that the Exhibition of
Plays and Shews was one of the very Engines of Cor∣ruption<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Thus CICERO speaks of the old Greek Comedy.—<Q REND="inline">"Esto: popu∣lares Homines, improbos, in
Rempublicam seditiosos, <HI>Cleonem, Cleo∣phontem, Hyperbolum</HI>
laesit:—Patiamur:—Sed PERICLEM, cum jam suae Civitati maxima
Auctoritate plurimos annos Domi et Bello praefuisset, violari Versibus,
et eos agi in Scena, non plus decuit, quam si <HI>Plautus</HI> noster
voluisset, aut <HI>Naevius, P.</HI> et <HI>Cn. Scipioni,</HI> aut
<HI>Caecilius M. Catoni,</HI> maledicere." 
<BIBL>Ex Frag. CIC. de Rep. l. iv.</BIBL></Q>—Where, we may
ob∣serve, the Judgment of CICERO is false concerning PERICLES: As it
ap∣pears, that he was the first Corrupter of the People: And it seems to
have been a just Punishment, that he was lashed by that illiberal Comedy,
which His own Influence first let in upon the State.</NOTE>.—The
concurrent Testimony of XENOPHON clears the whole Affair; and gives as a full
View of the Consequences of this general Corruption, so far as the <HI>old
Comedy</HI> is concerned. For in his Discourse on the <HI>Athe∣nian</HI>
Republic, he informs us, 1<HI>st,</HI> That, at the Period we have now fixed,

<Q REND="inline">"The Body of the People expelled All Good Men from
the Magistracy, and advanced wicked Men in their Places."</Q> 2<HI>dly,</HI>
That 
<Q REND="inline">"they took the <HI>Gymnastic</HI> and
<HI>Musical</HI> Exercises out of the Hands of the better Sort; and gave
the Practice and Profit of them to the Dregs of the People."</Q> 3<HI>dly,</HI>
That 
<Q REND="inline">"in their <PB N="148" REF="151"/> Comedies they
suffered none to be ridiculed, but those of higher Station and Worth;
unless one of their own Rank happened to distinguish himself by
something praise worthy; and then He became the Object of theatrical
Derision<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>XENOPHON <HI>de Rep.</HI>
ATHEN.</BIBL></NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>These Evidences are so clear and precise, as to leave no
Foundation of a Doubt on this Subject.</P>
<P>Lord SHAFTESBURY hath greatly mistaken this Matter in his
<HI>Advice to an Author</HI><NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot"><BIBL><HI>Characteristics,</HI> vol. i.</BIBL></NOTE>; and is as
careless or defec∣tive here in the Circumstance of Erudition, as at other
times in that of Reasoning. He seems in one Passage to attri∣bute the
late Cultivation and Establishment of the old Comedy to its being of more
<HI>difficult</HI> Composition than Tragedy: 
<Q REND="inline">"In this Part (Tragedy) the Poets succeeded
sooner than in Comedy, or the facetious Kind; as it was natural indeed to
suppose, since this was in reality the easiest (easier) Manner of
the two."</Q> This is deciding a doubtful Point by a mere Affirmation: For the
com∣parative Difficulty of these two Kinds hath been treated at large by a
learned and most judicious Writer, who after a candid and profound
Discussion of the Question, thinks it best to leave it undecided<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>BRUMOY <HI>Theatre des Grecs,</HI> tom.
vi.</BIBL>—This Question hath indeed been said, by a learned Writer,
to admit of a <HI>decisive Answer,</HI> on this Principle; that 
<Q REND="inline">"Tragedy, whose End is the <HI>Pathos,</HI>
produces it by <HI>Action,</HI> while Comedy produces its End, the
<HI>Humorous,</HI> by <HI>Character.</HI> Now it is much more difficult to
<HI>paint Manners,</HI> than to <HI>plan Action</HI>; because That requires
the <HI>Philosopher's Knowledge</HI> of <HI>human Nature</HI>; this, only the
<HI>Historian's Knowledge</HI> of <HI>human Events.</HI>"</Q>—But in
the Course of this Argument, it seems entirely forgot, that the tragic
Poet's Province is not only to <HI>plan,</HI> but to <HI>paint</HI> too. Had he
no farther Task, than what depends on the mere <HI>Historian's
Knowledge</HI> of <HI>human Events,</HI> the Reasoning would hold. But as it
is the first and most essential Effort of his Genius, in the
Construction of a <HI>compleat</HI> Tragedy, to <HI>invent</HI> and
<HI>order</HI> a <HI>pathetic</HI> Plan, <HI>consistent</HI> in all it's
Parts, and <HI>rising</HI> towards it's <HI>Com∣pletion</HI> by a
<HI>Succession</HI> of Incidents which may <HI>keep up</HI> and continually
<HI>in∣crease Terror</HI> or <HI>Pity</HI>; it is manifest, that the
<HI>Perfection</HI> of his <HI>Plan</HI> depends not on his mere <HI>historic
Knowledge</HI> of <HI>human Events,</HI> but on his <HI>philosophic
Discernment</HI> of <HI>human Passions</HI>; aided by a <HI>warm</HI> and
<HI>enlarged Invention:</HI> Talents as rare, at least, as the
<HI>Knowledge</HI> or <HI>Discernment</HI> of <HI>human
Cha∣racters.</HI>—If to this we add the subsequent Task, of giving
the <HI>high Colourings</HI> of <HI>Passion</HI> to the tragic
<HI>Plan</HI> thus <HI>ordered,</HI> the <HI>Difficulty</HI> of writing a
compleat <HI>Tragedy</HI> may seem to be in some Respects <HI>equal,</HI>
in others <HI>superior</HI> to that of producing a compleat <HI>Comedy:</HI>
For in the <HI>Conduct</HI> of this last Species, it is acknowledged, that a
<HI>small Degree</HI> of <HI>poetic Invention</HI> will <HI>support</HI>
it.</NOTE>. The noble Writer, next, seems to attribute the late Cultivation
of Comedy to 
<Q REND="inline">"the Spirit of literary Criticism, which in the
Nature <PB N="149" REF="152"/> of things could not arise, till it had
Materials to work on; and This he supposeth to have been the <HI>false
Sublime</HI> of their <HI>Tragedies,</HI> which were often <HI>parodied</HI> in
the <HI>old Comedy.</HI>"</Q>—But neither can this Cause be
sufficient to account for the Effect; because it appears that the best
Men, as well as the best Tragedies, were parodied or ridiculed more commonly
than the worst. Of this, the Fate of SOCRATES may stand as a convincing
Proof. This Fact could not entirely escape the Notice of the noble Writer;
for he acknowledges, that 
<Q REND="inline">"even this <HI>Remedy</HI> it∣self was found to
turn into a <HI>Disease</HI><NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>P.
248.</BIBL></NOTE>."</Q> But we have already proved, that it was a Disease
even on its first Appear∣ance. In a Word, the Authorities given above, in
Support of the true Causes of the Cultivation and Establishment of the
old Greek Comedy at ATHENS, contain the clearest Proof that the noble
Writer's Deductions on this Subject are <HI>specious,</HI> but <HI>not
solid</HI>; and that he discovers but little of what he seems to value
so much, 
<Q REND="inline">"a Comprehension of <PB N="150" REF="153"/> ancient
Manners and ancient History."</Q>—But, what is odd enough, after having
separately assigned these ficti∣tious Causes as being each the
Foundation on which the old Comedy arose and was established, He at
length glances accidentally upon the true one: Yet manifestly without any
particular Knowledge of the Facts which support it. 
<Q REND="inline">"According to this <HI>Homerical</HI> Lineage of
Poetry, <HI>Comedy</HI> would naturally prove the <HI>Drama</HI> of
<HI>latest Birth.</HI> For though ARISTOTLE cites HOMER's <HI>Margites</HI>
as analo∣gous to <HI>Comedy,</HI> yet the <HI>Iliad</HI> and
<HI>Odyssey,</HI> in which the heroic Style prevails, having been ever
<HI>highest in Esteem,</HI> were likeliest to be <HI>first wrought and
cultivated</HI><NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot"><BIBL><HI>Characteristics,</HI> vol.
i. p. 253. Notes.</BIBL></NOTE>."</Q> We may conclude, then, upon the Authority
of the three great Ancients cited above, that 
<Q REND="inline">"the Cultivation and <HI>Establishment</HI> of
the old <HI>Greek Comedy</HI> arose from the united <HI>Corruption</HI> and
<HI>Power</HI> of the <HI>Athenian</HI> Peo∣ple."</Q></P>
<P N="7">7. "The Ridicule and Invective of their Comedy, thus
established, was pointed chiefly against those Magistrates or private
Men, whose Qualities were hateful to the debauched Populace." For the Proof
of this, the Read∣er is referred to the Passages already cited from PLATO,
and XENOPHON: And on this Solution, the Fate of SO∣CRATES is clearly accounted
for. Nor could any thing be more natural, if the Causes here assigned for
the Esta∣blishment of the old Comedy be true. 
<Q REND="inline">"For Corruption being now established, as it
were, by Law: that is, by the Voice of a degenerate People, which stood in
the Place of Law; the Poets found it necessary to gratify the People's
Vices, as the surest Road to Success; and <PB N="151" REF="154"/> the only
Road to this, was now by the <HI>Ridicule</HI> of <HI>Virtue.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P N="8">8. "A Tyranny suddenly erected itself on the Ruins of the
corrupt <HI>Athenian</HI> People, and at once silenced this Species of
Comedy." This Event happened on the taking of ATHENS by LYSANDER; and thro' the
Authority of the thirty Tyrants whom he established there. These
<HI>Op∣pressors</HI> did That from <HI>Fear,</HI> which <HI>upright</HI>
Magistrates would have done from <HI>Virtue.</HI> The plain Reason hath
been assigned above: 
<Q REND="inline">"Because every thing hateful to the People being
now the established Subject of the comic Muse, the Tyrants who had
destroyed the public Liberty, must expect to become the Subject of Comedy,
if permitted to revel in its former Licentiousness."</Q> Here again the
noble Author of the Characteristics seems to assign a fictitious
Cause for this Event, drawn from his own Conjectures, instead of History.

<Q REND="inline">"Nothing could have been the Cause of this gradual
Reform in the Commonwealth of Wit, beside the real Reform of Taste and
Humour in the Commonwealth or Government itself."</Q>—For, saith he, 
<Q REND="inline">"it <HI>little concerned</HI> the <HI>Foreigners in
Power</HI> (the thirty Tyrants) after what Manner those <HI>Citizens</HI>
treated <HI>one another</HI> in their <HI>Comedies</HI>; or what sort of Wit
or Humour they made Choice of, for their ordinary Diversions<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot"><BIBL><HI>Characteristics,</HI> vol. i. p.
250.249.</BIBL></NOTE>."</Q> It can hardly be necessary to point out, in
what Circumstance this Reasoning is defective. Had the private Citizens
buffooned <HI>each other only</HI> in their <HI>Comedies,</HI> the <HI>Thirty
Tyrants</HI> would indeed have had little to fear: But as it is evident, that
the <HI>public Magistrates,</HI> and their <HI>Conduct,</HI> had been the
standing <PB N="152" REF="155"/> Objects of theatrical Ridicule, it certainly
<HI>much concerned</HI> these <HI>Foreigners in Power,</HI> to prevent that
sarcastic Repre∣sentation of their oppressive Government, which they
must necessarily expect from the keen Spirit of an exasperated and
licentious People. The noble Writer endeavours to confirm his Opinion by a
parallel Instance drawn from the <HI>Roman</HI> Commonwealth; where a
similar Prohibition took Place with regard to the <HI>Atellane</HI> Fables,
at a Time, when no Effects of foreign 
<Q REND="inline">"Power, or of a home Ty∣ranny can be pretended<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>P. 251.</BIBL></NOTE>."</Q> But this Instance,
joyned to the Evidences already given on the Subject, instead of confirming,
overturns his System: It only proves what was alledged above, that the
<HI>Athenian Tyrants</HI> did that from <HI>Fear,</HI> which the <HI>Roman
Magistrates</HI> did from <HI>Virtue.</HI></P>
<P N="9">9. "The Poets found a Subterfuge, for the Gratification of the
People; and continued to represent real Cha∣racters under feigned Names."
Thus the <HI>middle Co∣medy</HI> was naturally established. For this was
the only Species which they could now pursue with any Proba∣bility of
<HI>Success:</HI> And this was continued without much <HI>Danger,</HI> as we
find they were cautious with Respect to the Persons of the
Tyrants.—That such was the true Origin of this Change in the Character
of the Greek Comedy, appears farther from the two following Con∣siderations.
First, there is not the least Reason to be∣lieve the Athenian People were
at all changed from their coarse Manners and profligate Character, at the
Time when the old Comedy was silenced: And secondly, by the Accounts left
concerning the Genius of the <HI>mid∣dle Comedy,</HI> it appears, that it was
in all Respects as <PB N="153" REF="156" MS="y"/> illiberal and buffooning, in
its Beginnings as the old Comedy had been; the single Circumstance of
<HI>nominal Designation</HI> only accepted.</P>
<P N="10">10. "A great <HI>Conqueror</HI> arose: And, by subduing a
Variety of Nations, opened a <HI>Communication</HI> between the Commonwealth of
ATHENS, and the <HI>eastern</HI> King∣doms which were of more
<HI>luxurious</HI> and <HI>refined</HI> Man∣ners: On this Event, the
<HI>second</HI> or <HI>middle</HI> Species of <HI>Comedy</HI> naturally
received a <HI>Polish</HI>; and, laying aside the indirect personal
Invective, assumed the more delicate Form of general Raillery; and became a
Picture of human Life." The learned Reader will easily see, that ALEXANDER
<HI>the Great</HI> is the Conqueror here alluded to: in his Reign it was, and
not till that late Period, that the <HI>middle</HI> Comedy was polished into
the <HI>new.</HI> This was the natural Effect of that Politeness, which was
introduced at ATHENS by a frequent and familiar Commerce with the effeminate
Nations of the East. Till then, although the <HI>Athenians</HI> justly
boasted a Superiority in the <HI>Arts,</HI> yet in their Converse and
Treatment of each other, the concurrent Authority of ancient Historians, as
well as the more certain Testimony of their own remaining Comedies,
assure us, that they were of an <HI>illiberal</HI> and <HI>buffooning</HI>
Turn. But no sooner were the <HI>Asiatic</HI> Luxuries and Re∣finements
brought to ATHENS, by the Conquests of ALEXANDER, than their coarse Manners
melted gradually into false Politeness and Effeminacy. Now, 
<Q REND="inline">"one of the first Effects of a growing
Politeness, is to avoid all Occasions of Offence; and this, without
Respect to any Consequences, either good or bad, which may affect 
<PB N="154" REF="157" MS="y"/> the Public; but merely from a selfish Regard
to the Opinion of <HI>Elegance,</HI> and the Pride of
<HI>Urbanity.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>This Reasoning coincides in all Respects with the last
Progression of Comedy at ATHENS: And those Writers, as Lord SHAFTESBURY
and the Author of the Life of HOMER, who have attempted to resolve the
Establishment of the new Comedy into a <HI>Reform</HI> or
<HI>Improvement</HI> of Manners, in a <HI>virtuous</HI> Sense, have
mistaken <HI>Shadows</HI> for <HI>Realities,</HI> and confounded
<HI>Decency</HI> with <HI>Virtue.</HI> For it is certain, that both private and
public Virtue were at the lowest Ebb, while Comedy was assuming its
<HI>new</HI> and finished Form. This we are assured of by the concurrent
Testimony of PLUTARCH, JUSTIN, and other ancient Writers: Even so far were
the <HI>Athenians</HI> from regarding the public Welfare or Defence of their
Country, that it was made a capital Crime for any Man to propose the
Re∣establishment of their Militia, or the Application of the public Funds
to its Maintenance<NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>LIBANIUS <HI>Arg. ad</HI>
OLYNTH. I.</BIBL></NOTE>. Their Vices there∣fore were not
<HI>lessening,</HI> but <HI>refining:</HI> And the Idea of <HI>Decency</HI>
was sliding in, to supplant the rougher Appearances of <HI>Virtue.</HI> We
know a neighbour Nation, in which parallel Effects prevail: a Nation who are
too generally 
<Q REND="inline">"licentious in private Morals, though in public
Conduct decent:"</Q> And it is remarkable, that from this Refine∣ment in Vices,
a Species of Manners and of Comedy <HI>there</HI> prevails, altogether
similar to those of the later <HI>Greeks.</HI> For while their private
Conversation abounds with <HI>Irre∣ligion, Immorality,</HI> and
<HI>Obscenity,</HI> nothing is admitted on their Stage, but what is
consistent with <HI>Piety, good Morals,</HI> and <HI>good
Breeding.</HI></P>

<HEAD>SECT. VIII. Of the natural Union and Progressions of Melody
and Song, in other European Countries.</HEAD>
<P>THUS we have traced the Progression of the ancient
<HI>Greek</HI> MUSIC in all its Branches, through the various Stages of their
Union and Power, down to their final Separation and Corruption in the later
Periods. As a Confirmation of the essential Principles offered in this
Discourse, let us now consider this natural Union and Progression, as
it hath appeared in other Nations, where these Arts never arrived at so
compleat a Form; where the Progression ceased before any high Degree of
Per∣fection came on, either through a Want of improving Lite∣rature, or by
other Obstructions from internal or external Causes.</P>
<P>The nearest Approach we can make to the savage State, in any
Instance drawn from the Records of Antiquity, seems to be found in the
History of the <HI>Curetes,</HI> or <HI>Cory∣bantes</HI> of the Island of
CRETE. STRABO and DIODORUS, who give us their History, describe them as
barbarous Tribes of Men, living among Caves and Mountains, at once
<HI>Warriors, Priests, Poets,</HI> and <HI>Musicians</HI>; who cele∣brated
their public Festivals with enthusiastic and clamor∣ous Music, Song,
and Dance, accompanied with Drums, Cymbals, and other noisy Instruments,
almost in the very Manner of the savage Iroquois<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>STRABO, l. x. DIODORUS, l. v.</BIBL></NOTE>. RHADAMAN∣THUS
first, and then MINOS, civilized this barbarous Route; and regulated their
Manners and their Music, on <PB N="156" REF="159"/> the Model of the severe
<HI>Egyptian</HI> Legislation. After MINOS, THALES arose: In whom we find
the united Characters of Legislator and Musician: He composed Laws, for
the <HI>Cretan</HI> State, and sung them to his Lyre<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">As THALES succeeded RHADAMANTHUS and MINOS, who had
<HI>both</HI> copied the EGYPTIAN Forms of Legislation; his composing
<HI>Laws</HI> in <HI>Verse</HI> could only be the Effect of mere
<HI>Imitation.</HI></NOTE>. But Music being fixed to certain Forms by Law, we
are not to wonder that its Progression stopped, as at SPARTA; which
Commonwealth was modelled on the rigorous Esta∣blishment of CRETE.</P>
<P>With Respect to EGYPT, the Beginnings of that famous Kingdom are
so lost in its Antiquity, that we know no∣thing of the first Advances
there made in <HI>Music</HI> from its original Savage State. We only read,
that in some early Period of Civilization its Forms were unalterably fixed by
Law, and therefore all <HI>Improvement</HI> and <HI>Corruption</HI> alike
<HI>prevented.</HI></P>
<P>As to the more <HI>northern</HI> Nations of <HI>Europe,</HI> it is
re∣markable, that we know little of them from ancient His∣tory till the
second Period of Music commenced, that is, till the <HI>Legislator's</HI>
Character had been <HI>separated</HI> from that of the <HI>Musician.</HI>
The clearest Instance of the Union of the <HI>Legislator's</HI> and
<HI>Bard's</HI> Character is found in SNORRO STURLOSON, who, about five Hundred
and fifty Years ago, was at once the chief <HI>Legislator</HI> and most
eminent <HI>Bard</HI> in the Isle of ICELAND<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Preface to NICHOLSON's <HI>Irish Hist.
Library.</HI></BIBL></NOTE>. In the second Period, we meet with the poetic
and musical Character united in almost every northern Clime, under the
revered Denomi∣nation of <HI>Scaldi</HI> or <HI>Bards.</HI> It hath been
already observed, that ODIN the <HI>Scythian</HI> Legislator, boasted
that the <HI>Runic</HI> <PB N="157" REF="160"/> Songs had heen given him by the
Gods<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>See above, Sect. v.</BIBL></NOTE>. A
Circum∣stance which proves, that the Character of <HI>Heroe</HI> and
<HI>Musician</HI> had been united in the Chiefs of that fierce and savage
People, in the Period which immediately preceded him. We learn from SHERINGHAM
and BARTHOLINE, that after the first Separation had been made, the
<HI>Scaldi, Musicians,</HI> or <HI>Bards,</HI> were a Race of Men highly
honoured among the <HI>Scythian</HI> or <HI>Danish</HI> Tribes: That their
Songs were of the <HI>legislative</HI> Cast; that they sung the great
Actions of their Ancestors, were themselves renowned War∣riors, and kindled
the Valour of their Armies by their Songs: That none were admitted of the
Order, but those of the most distinguished Families<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>SHERINGHAM <HI>de Angl. Orig.</HI> p. 173.</BIBL></NOTE>:
That they were above the Meanness of Flattery; and were revered, even in the
Courts of Kings<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>BARTHOLINUS <HI>de Contemptu
Mortis apud Danos,</HI> l. i. c. 8.10.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P>We meet with the <HI>Gaulish Bards</HI> under the same Period of
Separation: But their Spirit seems to have been con∣trouled by a more
<HI>peaceable</HI> Species of Legislation. For STRABO tells us, that 
<Q REND="inline">"throughout the whole District of GAUL, there are
three Kinds of Men, who are held in singular Honour: The <HI>Bards,</HI> the
<HI>Vates,</HI> and the <HI>Druids:</HI> The <HI>Bards</HI> are <HI>Poets,</HI>
and <HI>sing</HI> their Hymns: The <HI>Vates</HI> perform <HI>Sacrifice,</HI>
and <HI>contemplate</HI> the Nature of Things: The <HI>Druids,</HI> besides
this, hold Discourses on <HI>Morals.</HI> They are esteemed the
justest of Men; and therefore are intrusted with the Determination of all
Differences, public and private; and sometimes peace∣ably end a Quarrel, when
Armies are drawn out, and ready to decide it by the Sword<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>L. iv.</BIBL></NOTE>."</Q> The Evidence of 
<PB N="158" REF="161"/> DIODORUS is still more particular; and proves, that
they were not insensible to the original Sallies of comic and sarcastic
Wit. 
<Q REND="inline">"They sing (saith He) to Instruments
resembling our Lyres; <HI>praising</HI> some, and <HI>satyrizing</HI>
others. When Armies are ready to engage, if they but come between, they
immediately put an End to the Battle; as if their Warriors were so many wild
Beasts, which they had charmed by the Power of their <HI>Songs</HI><NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>DION. l. v.</BIBL></NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>The <HI>British Bards,</HI> about the same Time, were
precisely of the same Character; as we learn from their contem∣porary
<HI>Roman</HI> Authors<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">A singular Circumstance
relative to the <HI>British Bards</HI> deserves No∣tice. It is said, that

<Q REND="inline">"although they were <HI>inferior</HI> to the
<HI>Druids</HI> in <HI>Rank,</HI> yet they were <HI>prior</HI> in
<HI>Antiquity.</HI>" 
<BIBL>[SAMMES's <HI>Phoenic. Ant. of Brit.</HI>]</BIBL></Q> A
Circumstance which, though improbable in it's first Appearance, is clearly
accounted for, on the Principles of this Dissertation; as it only implies
that <HI>Melody</HI> and <HI>Song</HI> were <HI>prior</HI> to <HI>religious
Rites.</HI> 
<BIBL>[See Sect. v. Art. 7.]</BIBL></NOTE>. In a succeeding
Period, when the Distractions of our Country, had driven the native
<HI>Britons</HI> into WALES, an <HI>English</HI> King still felt their
Power, amidst the Mountains and Poverty of that barren Region. He was so
highly exasperated by the Influence of their Songs, which breathed the Spirit
of Liberty and War, and retarded his Conquest over a hardy People, that he
basely ordered them to be slain: An Event, which hath lately given Birth to
an elegant and sublime Strain of Poetry<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>An Ode,
by Mr. GRAY.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P>Of the Genius of those <HI>British Bards</HI> who inhabited the
northern Districts of the Island, we have a noble Proof in the Poems lately
published under the Name of OSSIAN. These appear to have been composed
and sung, during the second Period of Music; that is, when the Bard's
Pro∣fession <PB N="159" REF="162"/> had separated from that of the
Legislator, yet still retained its Power and Dignity in full Union. For
OSSIAN, the declared Author of the Poems, was the Son of the royal FINGAL,
accompanied him in his Wars, and sung his Atchievements to the Harp. These
Poems give a noble Confirmation to many of the Principles ad∣vanced in this
Analysis. They are of various Forms; though none of them properly unmixed.
The <HI>Song,</HI> in the Days of this sublime and original Bard, appears
evi∣dently to have worn the <HI>inartificial</HI> and <HI>mixed</HI> Forms of
Composition, which we have found generally and of Course to prevail in the
early Periods. Thus, FINGAL is chiefly <HI>Epic</HI>; yet the <HI>hymnal</HI>
Species abounds in it: Others are <HI>dramatic</HI>; yet in these, the
<HI>narrative</HI> often takes Place: Others, again, are in the Form of
<HI>Odes</HI>; yet even these are strongly mixed and marked with the
<HI>Epic</HI> and <HI>dramatic</HI> Manner<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">As these
Circumstances are internal Proofs of the <HI>Antiquity</HI> of the Poems;
so there are other collateral Evidences of the same Nature, which seem
clearly to confirm it. Such are the grand Simplicity of Imagery and Diction,
the strong Draughts of rude Manners and uncultivated Scenes of Nature, which
abound in all these Poems; Pictures, which no civilized Modern could ever
imbibe in their Strength, nor consequently could ever throw out. Such, again,
are the frequent Allusions (wrought into the very Essence of the Poems)
to the Principles of the old <HI>Celtic</HI> Religion, which in ancient times
had overspread these Kingdoms: Of this Nature is That which the
Translator calls the <HI>most extravagant Fiction</HI> in all OSSIAN's
Poems; I mean, the Battle between FINGAL, and the Ghost or Spirit of
LODA<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL><HI>Carric-Thura:</HI> A
Poem.</BIBL></NOTE>: Now this, though it carries the Appearance of
Extravagance, and ill-judged Improbability, yet, upon a nearer View, will be
sound to contain an internal Evidence of the <HI>Antiquity</HI> of the Poem;
as it is drawn from the very Essence of the old <HI>Celtic</HI> Belief.
Thus speaks the learned BARTHOLINE:—<Q REND="inline">"Summa Audacia credebatur Lucta cum Spectris non
formidata<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><BIBL><HI>De Contemptu Mortis apud
Danes,</HI> l. ii. c. 2.</BIBL></NOTE>." "It was esteemed the highest Act
of Courage, to dare to encounter a Ghost."</Q>—But it must be
ob∣served, that the Spirit of their chief God ODIN was an Exception to this
Rule: The Living and the Dead were all deemed subject to his Controule
therefore, the Spirit of LODA was not the Spirit of ODIN, but of some
inferior Deity.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The natural Flame of savage Music and Poetry is now almost
entirely quenched in the several Parts of this Island: 
<PB N="160" REF="163"/> In <HI>England,</HI> it lost its Power by the
Migration of the native <HI>Britons</HI> into WALES: In Wales, it was quenched
by the Cruelty of EDWARD: In the Highlands of SCOT∣LAND, the Writer is well
informed, that the Bard's Pro∣fession was upheld in some Degree of
Honour, till near the Beginning of this Century. About which Time, the
Communication of the Inhabitants with the more civilized Parts of the Kingdom
by Degrees assimilated their Man∣ners to those of their Neighbours; by
which means the Profession became extinct<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">About the
Close of the last Century, JOHN GLASS and JOHN MACDONALD, <HI>Bards</HI> by
Profession, who resided and were respected as such in the Houses of
two <HI>Highland Chiefs,</HI> traveled fifty Miles and met by Appointment in
LOCHABAR, to vindicate their own Honour and that of their respective Chiefs
at a public Meeting, in a <HI>poetic</HI> and <HI>musical
Contest.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>The History of the <HI>Irish Bards</HI> is perhaps of all others
the most extraordinary; and will therefore deserve a par∣ticular Regard.
History doth not carry us up to the first Period, in which the
<HI>Legislator's</HI> and <HI>Bard's</HI> Cha∣racter are united in the same
Person. But of the second Period we have large Accounts in the
<HI>Irish</HI> Historians. For we are informed, there were three principal
Tribes among the ancient <HI>Irish.</HI> 
<Q REND="inline">"The First were <HI>Leaders, Chiefs,</HI> or
<HI>Legislators:</HI> The Second were <HI>Druids</HI> or
<HI>Priests:</HI>"</Q> The Third were <HI>Bards.</HI> The two last were 
<PB N="161" REF="164" MS="y"/> honoured with an Appellation equivalent to the
Name of <HI>Gods</HI><NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>KEATING's <HI>Hist.</HI>
of IRELAND, p. 48.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P>The <HI>Bards</HI> had estates settled on them, that they might
be free from worldly Cares: They lived in perfect In∣dependence, and were
obliged to no Service: Their Per∣sons were inviolable: To kill them, was
esteemed the blackest Crime; and it was held an Act of Sacrilege to seize
their Estates, even for the public Service, and in Times of the greatest
Distress<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Ib. p. 132.
&amp;c.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P>The Profession was hereditary: But when the <HI>Bard</HI> died,
his Estate descended not to his eldest Son, but to the most
accomplished of his Family in the musical Profession. A Law was made by
OLLAMH FODHLA, one of their greatest Kings, that none should be invested
with the Dignity of a <HI>Bard,</HI> but those of the most illustrious
Families<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Ibid.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P>The <HI>Bards,</HI> the <HI>Druids,</HI> and <HI>Nobility,</HI> were
summoned by the same King, to a <HI>triennial Festival,</HI> which was
thus by him established, to transmit to Posterity the <HI>Authentic
Songs</HI> of the <HI>Bards,</HI> as the Materials of their future
His∣tories. In Consequence of this, the approved Songs of the ancient Bards
were preserved in the Custody of the King's Antiquary; and are appealed to
by KEATING, as the Foundation of his History<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Ib. p. 132. &amp; Preface, p. 23.</BIBL></NOTE>. Many of
them were fabulous; but this Circumstance hath no essential Relation to
our present Inquiry.</P>
<P>Garments of different Colour were appropriated to the various Ranks
of the Kingdom: So high was the Power <PB N="162" REF="165"/> and Dignity of the
<HI>Bards,</HI> that they wore the <HI>same Colour</HI> with the <HI>royal
Family</HI><NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>KEATING's <HI>Hist.</HI> of
IRELAND, p. 127.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P>Thus invested with Honours, Wealth, and Power; and
possessed of an Art which gave them a natural Influence over the Minds
of the People; we find, that about the year 558, they had become insolent,
deeply corrupted, and dangerous. Hence, the reigning King convened a general
Council of the Nobility and Gentry (for Christi∣anity being now planted in
IRELAND, the <HI>Druids</HI> were no more) with Intention to expel them the
Island. They were now become a Kind of <HI>sacred Order,</HI> or
<HI>College</HI>; which was grow so numerous, that one third of the Kingdom
is said to have ranked themselves in this Class, as a safe Asylum for
Idleness and Hypocrisy. When the <HI>Principal Bards</HI> assembled in
a Body to divert this im∣pending Storm, they met, to the Number of a
<HI>Thousand.</HI> This may account for the Numbers that claimed to be of the
Profession; for every <HI>Principal Bard</HI> retained <HI>thirty</HI> of
inferior Note, as his Attendants; and a <HI>Bard</HI> of the <HI>second</HI>
Order was followed by a Retinue of <HI>fifteen.</HI> In this Convention, after
many Debates, it was resolved that they should leave the Island, and
retire into SCOTLAND, be∣fore the Sentence of their Banishment was
pronounced.—However, the Sentence was mitigated: They were al∣lowed to
disperse themselves over the Island, and promised to live in a Manner
less offensive to the Public<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Ib. 370,
&amp;c.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P>In a succeeding, and no very distant Period, we find them again
grown troublesome to the Kings, who com∣plained <PB N="163" REF="166" MS="y"/>
of them, as a Burthen to the People, lazy, covet∣ous, and insatiable. On
this, their Number was lessened and regulated: By the Advice of St. COLUM
CILL, every provincial <HI>Chief</HI> had <HI>one</HI> learned <HI>Bard</HI>
allowed him in his Retinue, to <HI>record</HI> the <HI>Atchievements</HI> of
his Family: Their Independance, with a competent Revenue, was preserved: And
this Regulation was the Standard, by which the Society of Bards were directed
in succeeding Ages<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>KEATING's <HI>Hist.</HI>
of IRELAND, p. 380, 381.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P>'Tis to be observed, that in some unrecorded Period, a
<HI>Separation</HI> had taken Place in the <HI>Bard's</HI> Profession: In
the early Times, the Offices of <HI>Poet</HI> and <HI>Lyrist</HI> were united
in the same Person: In the later Ages, it appears, that the <HI>Bard</HI>
only composed the <HI>Poem</HI>; and that it was <HI>sung</HI> by a
<HI>Rhapsodist</HI> or <HI>Harper</HI> at the public Festivals.</P>
<P>However, we find that on the Extinction of Learn∣ing, and Increase
of Barbarism in this Kingdom, the native Vigour of the poetic Stock again
shot up in a succeeding Age; and for Want of a proper Culture, was again
become one of the ruling Evils of the Coun∣try, in the Time of SPENSER; Who
gives the follow∣ing animated Description of their <HI>Songs</HI> and
<HI>Cha∣racter:</HI> 
<Q REND="inline">"There is amongst the <HI>Irish</HI> a certain
Kind of People called <HI>Bardes,</HI> which are to them instead of
<HI>Poets,</HI> whose Profession is to set forth the <HI>Praises</HI>
or <HI>Dispraises</HI> of Men in their Poems or Rythmes; the which are had
in so high Regard and Estimation amongst them, that none dare
displease them for Fear to run into Reproach through their Offence, and to
be made <PB N="164" REF="167"/> infamous in the Mouths of all Men. For their
Verses are taken up with a general Applause, and usually <HI>sung</HI>
at all <HI>Feasts</HI> and <HI>Meetings</HI> by certain <HI>other
Persons,</HI> whose proper Function that is, who also receive for the
same great Rewards and Reputation amongst them."—"These <HI>Irish
Bardes</HI> are for the most Part so far from instructing young Men in
<HI>moral</HI> Discipline, that they themselves do more deserve to be
sharply disciplined: For they seldom use to choose unto themselves
the Doings of <HI>good</HI> Men for the Arguments of their Poems; but
whomsoever they find to be most <HI>licentious</HI> of Life, most
<HI>bold</HI> and <HI>lawless</HI> in his Doings, most <HI>danger∣ous</HI>
and <HI>desperate</HI> in all Parts of Disobedience and rebel∣lious
Disposition; Him they <HI>set up</HI> and <HI>glorify</HI> in their
<HI>Rythmes,</HI> Him they <HI>praise</HI> to the <HI>People,</HI> and to
<HI>young</HI> Men make an <HI>Example</HI> to follow."—Thus "evil things
being decked and attired with the gay Attire of goodly Words, may easily
deceive and carry away the Affection of a young Mind that is not well stayed,
but desirous by some bold Adventures to make Proof of himself. For being
(as they all be) brought up idely without Awe of Parents, without Precepts of
Masters, and without Fear of Offence; not being directed, nor employed in any
Course of Life which may carry them to Virtue; will easily be drawn to
follow such as any shall set before them: For a young Mind cannot rest:
If he be not still busied in some Goodness, he will find himself
such Business, as shall soon busy all about him. In which, if he
shall find any to praise him, and to give him Encouragement, as those
<HI>Bardes</HI> and <HI>Rythmers</HI> do for little Reward, or a Share of a
<HI>stoln Cow,</HI> then <PB N="165" REF="168" MS="y"/> waxeth he most
insolent and half mad with the Love of himself, and his own lewd Deeds. And
as for Words to set off such Lewdness, it is not hard for them to give a
goodly and painted shew thereunto, borrowed even from the Praises which are
proper to Virtue itself: As of a most notorious <HI>Thief</HI> and wicked
<HI>Outlaw,</HI> which had lived all his Life Time of <HI>Spoils</HI> and
<HI>Robberies,</HI> one of their <HI>Bardes</HI> in his Praise will say,
that he was none of the idle <HI>Milk-Sops</HI> that was brought up by the
<HI>Fire-side</HI>; but that most of his Days he spent in <HI>Arms</HI>
and valiant <HI>Enterprises:</HI> That he did never eat his Meat, before he
had won it with his Sword: That he lay not all Night slugging in a Cabin
under his Mantle; but used commonly to keep others waking to defend their
Lives; and did light his Candle at the Flames of their Houses, to lead him in
the Darkness: That the Day was his Night, and the Night his Day: That he
loved not to be long wooing of Wenches to yield to him; but where he came, he
took by Force the Spoil of other Men's Love, and left but Lamentation to their
Lovers: That his Music was not the Harp, nor Lays of Love, but the Cries of
People, and the clashing of Armour: And finally, that he died, not bewailed
of many, but made many wail when he died, that dearly bought his
Death."—"I have caused divers of these Poems to be translated unto
me, that I might under∣stand them: And surely, they savoured of
<HI>sweet Wit</HI> and <HI>good Invention</HI>; but <HI>skilled not</HI> of
the <HI>goodly Orna∣ments</HI> of Poetry: Yet were they sprinkled with some
<HI>pretty Flowers</HI> of their <HI>natural Device,</HI> which gave good Grace
and Comeliness unto them: The which it is <PB N="166" REF="169" MS="y"/>
<HI>great Pity</HI> to see so <HI>abused,</HI> to the <HI>gracing</HI> of
<HI>Wickedness</HI> and <HI>Vice,</HI> which with <HI>good Usage</HI> would
serve to <HI>adorn</HI> and <HI>beautify Virtue</HI><NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>SPENSER's View of the State of

<HEAD>SECT. IX. Of the natural Union and Progressions of Melody and
Song in CHINA, PERU, and INDIA.</HEAD>
<P>SUCH have been the natural <HI>Union</HI> and
<HI>Progressions</HI> of <HI>Melody</HI> and <HI>Song,</HI> in the babarous
Nations of EUROPE. If we travel to the Extremes of East and West, on the
vast Continents of ASIA and AMERICA, we shall find new and strong

<P>The <HI>Chinese</HI> have ever been of a <HI>mild</HI> and
<HI>peaceable</HI> Cha∣racter: Their <HI>Music</HI> will be found analogous.
'Tis generally supposed, that CONFUCIUS established their
<HI>Music</HI> and <HI>Rites:</HI> but it appears from some curious
Fragments of ancient <HI>Chinese</HI> History, that <HI>Music</HI> and
the <HI>Rites</HI> existed in <HI>Union,</HI> long before the Age of that
Philosopher<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot"><BIBL><HI>Extraits des Hist.

<Q REND="inline">"TCHO∣YONG, <PB N="167" REF="170" MS="y"/> the
sixteenth Emperor of the ninth Period, hearing a Concert of Birds, invented a
Species of Music, whose Harmony was irresistible. It touched the
intelligent Soul, and calmed the Heart of Man; so that the exter∣nal Senses
were sound, the Humours in a just Poise, and the Life of Man
lengthened<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot"><BIBL><HI>Extraits des Hist. Chinois,</HI>

Picture of a <HI>Chief,</HI> at once <HI>Legislator</HI> and <HI>Bard,</HI>
civilizing a savage People.</P>
<P>The <HI>Dance</HI> was improved in the same Manner, by the
twentieth King of the ninth Period, to the Ends of peace∣ful Life<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Ib. 555.</BIBL></NOTE>. And of such Importance has this
Branch of the musical Art been always held in CHINA, that it it is an

<HI>Dances</HI> that are then in Use<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Ib. p.

<P>These Evidences are traditionary, and relate to the fabulous
Times: But even in a later Period, we find the <HI>kingly</HI> and
<HI>musical</HI> Characters <HI>united,</HI> in the Person of FOU-HI, their
first great imperial Legislator. 
<Q REND="inline">"FOU-HI de∣livered the Laws of Music: After he had
invented the Art of <HI>Fishing,</HI> he composed a <HI>Song</HI> for
those who ex∣ercised that Art. He made a <HI>Lyre,</HI> with Strings of
<HI>Silk,</HI> to banish all <HI>Impurity</HI> of Heart: And in his Time the
<HI>Rites</HI> and <HI>Music</HI> were in great <HI>Perfection</HI><NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Ib. p. 567.</BIBL></NOTE>."</Q> All this is evidently
in the true Spirit of a peaceable Legisla∣tion. 
<Q REND="inline">"CHIN-NONG (a succeeding Emperor) composed Songs
on the <HI>Fertility</HI> of the Earth. He made a beauti∣ful <HI>Lyre,</HI> and
a <HI>Guitar</HI> adorned with precious Stones, which produced a noble Harmony,
curbed the Passions, and elevated Man to <HI>Virtue</HI> and heavenly
<HI>Truth</HI><NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Ib. p. 572.</BIBL></NOTE>."</Q> 
<PB N="168" REF="171"/> This is the same Character continued under a Period of
higher Civilization. The last Emperor whom I find to have retained the poetic
or Musical Character, was CHAO-HAO; who is said to have invented 
<Q REND="inline">"a new Species of Music, to unite Men with
superior Beings."</Q> After him, the <HI>complex</HI> Office seems to have
<HI>separated:</HI> And the first great <HI>Bardlike</HI> Character we meet
with is CONFU∣CIUS, who established <HI>Music</HI> and the
<HI>Rites,</HI> according to that Form which they still maintain in
CHINA<NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>DU HALDE <HI>Hist.
Chinois.</HI></BIBL></NOTE>. For here, as in ancient EGYPT, CRETE, and SPARTA,
every thing is unalterably fixed by Law; by which Means, Improvement and
Corruption are alike prevented.</P>
<P>With Respect to the Extent of the <HI>Progression</HI> of
Music in this vast Empire; it appears, that they have no musical
Notation; that Composition in <HI>Parts</HI> is altogether un∣known; and that
the whole <HI>Choir</HI> sings the <HI>same</HI> Melody: That their Music
is altogether of the <HI>diatonic Kind,</HI> and even wretched to an
<HI>European</HI> Ear<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>See Specimens of it, in DU
HALDE.</BIBL></NOTE>: Yet they boast of its wonderful Powers in former Times:
Whence some of the Historians seem to guess that it hath degenerated;
while in reality, no other Consequence can be justly drawn, but that either
the People are less <HI>ignorant</HI> and <HI>barbarous</HI>; or that Music
is now less assiduously and powerfully <HI>applied</HI>; or that
certain <HI>Separations</HI> have en∣sued, similar to those which took
Place in ancient GREECE: Any of which Causes must naturally destroy its
Force.</P>
<P>It appears, however, that the Progression had advanced so far
in some former Period, prior to CONFUCIUS, as to produce <HI>dramatic
Representation,</HI> mixed with <HI>Song:</HI> And <PB N="169" REF="172"/> in
Conformity, to the Principles given above, we find, that as they regard not the
<HI>Unities</HI> of Action, Place, or Time, so neither is any <HI>continued
Choir</HI> in use; though there be manifest Remains of it in their
<HI>Plays:</HI> For at the Conclusion of Scenes or Acts, as well as at other
Times when a <HI>pathetic</HI> Circumstance occurs, the Persons of the
Play, instead of <HI>declaiming,</HI> begin to <HI>sing.</HI> The
<HI>Prologue</HI> resembles that uncouth one of GREECE, that is, he tells you
<HI>who</HI> he is, and <HI>what</HI> is his <HI>Errand.</HI> All their Plays
have a <HI>moral</HI> or <HI>political</HI> Direction, suited to the Genius
of the People and the State. They know not the Difference between
<HI>Tragedy</HI> and <HI>Comedy</HI>; another Circumstance which confirms the
Principle given above, concerning the true Rise and Distinction of these
two Kinds in GREECE: For the <HI>Chinese,</HI> as they have ever been of a
<HI>timid</HI> and <HI>peaceable</HI> Cha∣racter, so neither are they given
to <HI>Raillery</HI> or <HI>Sarcasm,</HI> but al∣together to
<HI>Civility</HI> and mutual <HI>Respect.</HI> Hence, neither the
<HI>Tragic</HI> nor <HI>comic</HI> Drama could probably arise, so as to be
marked as a <HI>distinct Species.</HI> Accordingly, their <HI>Plays</HI> are
generally of an <HI>intermediate</HI> Cast, between <HI>Terror</HI> and
<HI>Pity</HI> on the one Hand, <HI>Sarcasm</HI> or <HI>Ridicule</HI> on the
other. The "<HI>little Orphan</HI> of CHINA," indeed, which is given as a
Specimen by DU HALDE, borders on the <HI>tragic</HI> Species: But this Play is
but one of a hundred, most of which are of a different Cast; and was
selected by him, because he thought it the best adapted in its Genius, to
the Spirit and Taste of the <HI>Europeans:</HI> For he tells us expresly,
that the general Character of their Plays are altogether different from this;
that they are commonly of a <HI>middle</HI> Kind, and neither <HI>Tragedy</HI>
nor <HI>Comedy.</HI> Another Circumstance of the Progression must be
marked; which <PB N="170" REF="173"/> is, that their <HI>Actors</HI> are a
<HI>separate</HI> Rank from their <HI>Poets</HI>; that they are formed into
<HI>Companies,</HI> and have lost their original Dignity of Office and
Character.</P>
<P>In the ancient Kingdom of PERU, the Progression of
<HI>Music</HI> had reached the same Period, though somewhat different in
its Circumstances. GARCILASSO DE LA VEGA informs us, that their fabulous
Songs were in∣numerable; that he had heard many, and learnt some of them,
from his Ancestors, who were the last of the royal Family of the INCAS.
They were of various Kinds, founded on a Variety of Passion, religious,
warlike, and amorous. They had invented a Kind of <HI>unequal Pipe,</HI> formed
of Reeds of different Lengths, precisely the same with that of ancient
GREECE. They had also a Species of Flute, with four or five Stops: Their
Music was simple, like that of all unpolished Countries. Their INCAS or
<HI>Chiefs</HI> had been <HI>Poets</HI> or <HI>Musicians</HI> in the early
Periods; and the Author of the Commentaries gives a Poem com∣posed by one of
them, which bears all the Marks of a spirited and savage Original. They had
their <HI>dramatic</HI> Re∣presentations, in Part <HI>resembling,</HI> and
in Part <HI>differing</HI> from those of the <HI>Chinese.</HI> Their
Manners and Character, <HI>brave</HI> though not <HI>ferocious,</HI> had
naturally produced <HI>Tragedy,</HI> though of a Kind rather <HI>grand</HI>
than <HI>terrible</HI><NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>See above, Sect. vi. Art.
24.</BIBL></NOTE>. But their <HI>mild Temper,</HI> in Time of <HI>Peace</HI>
little given to <HI>Sarcasm,</HI> seems to have <HI>prevented</HI> the
Birth of <HI>Comedy.</HI> GARCI∣LASSO, indeed, divides their <HI>Drama</HI>
into <HI>Tragedy</HI> and <HI>Comedy:</HI> But this was manifestly the Effect
of his own preconceived Opinions, and arose from a Habit of con∣sidering
all <HI>dramatic</HI> Composition as belonging to one <PB N="171" REF="174"/>
of these <HI>Species.</HI> For he tells us that 
<Q REND="inline">"their <HI>Tragedies</HI> represented their
military Exploits; the <HI>Triumphs, Victories,</HI> and <HI>heroic
Actions</HI> of their renowned Men: And the Subject or Design of their
Comedies was to demonstrate the Manner of good <HI>Husbandry</HI> in
<HI>culti∣vating</HI> and manuring their <HI>Fields,</HI> and to shew the
Management of domestic Affairs, with other familiar Matters."</Q> A
Circumstance, which ought to give them the Title of <HI>Bucolic</HI> or
<HI>Georgic Drama,</HI> rather than that of <HI>Comedy.</HI> For not a Word
occurs concerning <HI>Ridicule</HI> or <HI>Character</HI>; the <HI>Union</HI>
of which two Circumstances may seem to constitute the
<HI>Essence</HI> of <HI>true Comedy.</HI> These Plays were
<HI>composed</HI> by the <HI>Amautas</HI> or <HI>Bards,</HI> whose Office
was separated from that of the INCAS, but still held in Honour, as in other
barbarous Polities. But in another Respect, the Progression was different
from that in CHINA. The <HI>Actors</HI> maintained the original Dignity which
they had held in the early Periods: For the <HI>Lords</HI> and
<HI>Officers</HI> of the Court were the <HI>Actors</HI>; and as soon as the
Play was ended, they took their <HI>Places</HI> according to their
<HI>Degrees</HI><NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>GARCILASSO DE LA VEGA
<HI>Comment. Real.</HI> l. ii. c. 14, 15.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P>To these we may add one Instance more, concerning the natural
Union and Progression of Music and Poetry: An Instance less known,
yet more singular than any of these already given. When the <HI>Christian
Missionaries</HI> arrived on the Coast of <HI>proper India,</HI> they
found a Sect called the "<HI>Christians of St.</HI> THOMAS," living in great
Simplicity and Innocence; and retaining many of the original Cus∣toms of
their savage Forefathers<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>LA CROZE <HI>Hist.
du Christ.</HI> p. 38, &amp;c.</BIBL></NOTE>: among others, they 
<PB N="172" REF="175"/> found these Christians, as well as the Pagans of the
Coun∣try, possessed of rude <HI>Music</HI> and <HI>Poetry,</HI> in
their <HI>natural Union</HI> and <HI>Power.</HI> They acquiesced in the
Application of these Arts, already made by the Christian Tribe, and
wisely laid hold of their Influence, for the Conversion of the Pagan
Natives. Under these Circumstances, the following Accounts will appear
natural and probable, on the Principles already delivered.</P>
<P>First, it appears that the general and Fundamental Practice of
<HI>singing</HI> the <HI>Praise</HI> of <HI>great Men,</HI> had been
maintained from the most ancient Times. In Consequence of this, 
<Q REND="inline">"The Synode being ended, the Partisans of the
Union composed in the <HI>Malabar</HI> Tongue a long <HI>Ode</HI> or
<HI>Song,</HI> which contained the whole <HI>History</HI> of the
<HI>Portu∣guese Prelate,</HI> and a pompous Detail of what had passed at
the Synod. This Nation hath preserved the ancient Custom of consecrating
to Posterity by this Kind of Poem all the most remarkable Events. The Song
was caught and immediately dispersed every where; and during the Visits
which the Prelate made, the People sung it in his Presence; which together
with their <HI>Dances</HI> and <HI>Music</HI> made the chief Part of his
Entertain∣ment<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>LA CROZE <HI>Hist. du
Christ.</HI> p. 282.</BIBL></NOTE>. When he went to ANGAMALE, the Way was
spread with Carpets: And it was a fine Sight, to see a <HI>Child</HI> of
six Years old, very beautiful, and richly dressed, who <HI>sung</HI>
melodiously the whole <HI>Song</HI> we have spoken of, as containing the
<HI>Labours</HI> of the <HI>Pre∣late</HI><NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Ib. p.
294.</BIBL></NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>The religious <HI>Song</HI> and <HI>Dance</HI> were no less
remarkably and singularly maintained in a Kind of imperfect <HI>Union,</HI> 
<PB N="173" REF="176"/> as they had been transfered from <HI>Pagan</HI> Objects
to those of <HI>Christianity.</HI> 
<Q REND="inline">"In the same Place, the <HI>Christian
Mala∣bars,</HI> to amuse the Archbishop, gave him a <HI>Ball</HI> after the
Manner of the Country. It was of so singular a Nature, that I am
persuaded, the Reader will not be displeased with the Description.
These <HI>Dances</HI> are generally practised at <HI>Night.</HI> This begun
at eight in the Evening, and lasted till an Hour after Midnight. None but the
Men dance; and their Modesty and Reserve are admirable. Before the
<HI>Dance</HI> begins they all make the <HI>Sign</HI> of the <HI>Cross,</HI>
and <HI>sing</HI> the <HI>Lord's Prayer,</HI> which is followed by a
<HI>Hymn,</HI> in Honour of <HI>St. Thomas.</HI> Their other <HI>Songs</HI>
rowl chiefly on the <HI>illustrious Actions</HI> of their
<HI>Forefathers,</HI> or the <HI>Virtues</HI> of their <HI>Saints.</HI> In a
Word, this Entertainment has all the Air of <HI>an Act of Devotion</HI>; on
which, the <HI>Portuguese Historian</HI> takes Occasion to inveigh
against the <HI>prophane Songs</HI> of the <HI>Europeans,</HI> which seem
composed only to inspire <HI>Debauch</HI> and <HI>Immodesty</HI><NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>LA CROZE <HI>Hist. du Christ.</HI> p.
296.</BIBL></NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>The Missionaries who have visited the opposite Coast of
COROMANDEL, give us Proof, that the <HI>Progression</HI> of
<HI>Music</HI> and <HI>Poetry</HI> had not stopped at this early Period,
but advanced to <HI>theatrical Representation</HI>; which, we shall see,
they were bold enough to apply even to the great Purpose of
<HI>Conversion.</HI> 
<Q REND="inline">"In this Country they have an extreme Passion
for the <HI>Theatre.</HI> Good Poets are held in great <HI>Veneration</HI>
among this People, who are by no means of a barbarous Cast. In INDIA, Poetry
enjoys the Favour of the Great. They give its young Pro∣fessors the Honour
of the <HI>Palanquin,</HI> which is a very <PB N="174" REF="177"/> high
Distinction. The <HI>Theatre,</HI> which was prepared near our Church, was of
vast Extent. Indeed I found not there the Rules of HORACE or BOILEAU put in
Practice; but was agreeably surprized to find the <HI>Acts</HI>
distinguished, and varied with <HI>Interludes</HI> or <HI>Choirs,</HI> the
Scenes well connected, the Machines judiciously in∣vented, Art in the Conduct
of the Piece, Taste in the Dresses, Propriety in the <HI>Dances,</HI> and
a kind of <HI>Music,</HI> harmonious though <HI>irregular</HI> and
<HI>wild.</HI> The <HI>Actors</HI> displayed great <HI>Freedom</HI> and
<HI>Dignity</HI> in their Speech: They were taken from one of the <HI>Superior
Orders</HI> or <HI>Castes.</HI> Their Memory was good, and there were <HI>no
Prompters.</HI> That which edified me most was, that the Piece began with an
authentic Profession of Christianity: And contained the keenest
<HI>Ridicule</HI> and severest <HI>In∣vectives</HI> on the <HI>Gods</HI> of
the Country. Such are the <HI>Christian Tragedies,</HI> which they oppose
here to the <HI>pro∣phane Tragedies</HI> of the <HI>Idolaters</HI><NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Hence it appears that the <HI>History</HI> of their
<HI>Gods</HI> made the Subject of their <HI>native</HI> theatrical
Representations.</NOTE>; and they are, for this Reason, an excellent Mean
of Conversion<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">How far this was a proper Method of
Conversion, will be considered in the Work advertised at the End of this
Dissertation.</NOTE>.—The Audience was composed of at least
twenty thousand Souls, who listened in profound Silence.—The
Charac∣ter of their Theatre is that of a <HI>lively</HI> and <HI>perpetual

proper <HI>Breaks</HI><NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot"><BIBL><HI>Lettres Edifiantes,

<P>Such is the State of <HI>Melody</HI> and <HI>Song</HI> in proper
INDIA. Some of its Appearances are singular; and at first View, may seem
unnatural. But after a mature Considera∣tion <PB N="175" REF="178"/> of what
hath been delivered on the Union, Pro∣gression, and Separation of these
Arts in ancient GREECE, 'tis presumed, the sensible Reader will easily
account for all these apparent Singularities.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="10" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. X. Of the natural Union and Progressions of Melody and
Song amongst the ancient Hebrews.</HEAD>
<P>LET us now, in Conclusion, analyze the State of Me∣lody and Song,
among the ancient <HI>Hebrews.</HI></P>
<P>The leading Singularity of this extraordinary People was their
Rejection of Idolatry, and their established Worship of the <HI>one</HI>
GOD, the <HI>Creator</HI> of the World. As this Cir∣cumstance gave a peculiar
Colour to their <HI>Religion</HI>; so, upon the Principles of this
Dissertation it will follow, that it must give a Peculiar Turn to their
<HI>Music</HI>; because we have seen, that the Genius of the <HI>original
Music</HI> of every Country depends on its <HI>Religion</HI> as its chief
<HI>Basis.</HI></P>
<P>In Consequence of this Principle, their <HI>Song</HI> or
<HI>Poem</HI> was chiefly dedicated to the <HI>Celebration</HI> of the
<HI>true</HI> GOD, the <HI>Creator</HI> of all things: At other Times it is
composed of <HI>moral Exhortations,</HI> delivered as the Dictates of his
Will, or thrown out in prophetic Raptures concerning the great Intents of his
Providence.—Hence the <HI>Hymn, Ode,</HI> or poetic <HI>Rapture,</HI>
which we have found to be naturally the first Form of Composition among all
Na∣tions, appeared with unrivaled Splendor in the <HI>Hebrew</HI> Poetry,
because its <HI>Object</HI> is so much <HI>Superior</HI> to that of other
Nations: The one being no more than the limited and narrow Power of
supposed <HI>local Gods</HI>; the other, <PB N="176" REF="179" MS="y"/> the
Omnipotence and Wisdom of an <HI>eternal</HI> and <HI>universal
Creator.</HI> Of this Distinction their <HI>Bards</HI> were fully
sen∣sible. 
<Q REND="inline">"As for the Gods of the Heathen, they are but
<HI>Idols</HI>; but it is the <HI>Lord,</HI> that <HI>made</HI> the
<HI>Heavens.</HI>"</Q> The Book of Psalms, the Lamentations, the Songs of
MOSES, DAVID, ISAIAH, and other Prophets, all written in Measure, and sung
by those who composed them, are so many striking Instances of the
true and unequaled Sublime.</P>
<P>With Respect to the <HI>Form,</HI> it may be observed, that
their <HI>Songs</HI> or <HI>Hymns</HI> are of that <HI>mixed</HI> Species which
naturally ariseth first, before any Separations take Place, or produce the
several Species of Composition. Though the <HI>hymnal</HI> Form be chiefly
<HI>predominant,</HI> yet we find them frequently to be a Mixture of <HI>Ode,
Narration,</HI> and <HI>Dia∣logue</HI>; and thus they contain the Seeds or
Principles of the three great succeeding Kinds, of <HI>unmixed Ode,
Epic,</HI> and <HI>Tragedy.</HI></P>
<P>It may be regarded as an extraordinary Circumstance, that this
first <HI>mixed</HI> Form of Composition should have continued unchanged
for a Period of at least a thousand Years; and that from first to last
it should never move forward, so as to produce the <HI>Epic</HI> and
<HI>Dramatic</HI> Species: But on Examination it will appear, that the same
Cause (the Worship of the one GOD) which produced the highest Degree of
Sublime in the <HI>hymnal</HI> Species, naturally <HI>checked</HI> the Course
of poetry among the JEWS; and pre∣vented that <HI>Progression</HI> which we
have found to arise from the natural State of Things, in <HI>Pagan</HI>
Countries.</P>
<P>With Respect to the <HI>Epic</HI> Poem, we have seen that, in
its first and original Conception and Formation, it is no 
<PB N="177" REF="180"/> other than 
<Q REND="inline">"A fabulous History, rowling chiefly on the great
Actions of the Gods and Heroes of the Nation; and composed under certain
Limitations with Respect to its Manner, for the Ends of Pleasure,
Admiration, and Instruction."</Q> Hence, the <HI>true</HI> GOD being the
sole Object of the Adoration of the HEBREWS, and their Re∣cords being the
sacred Depositary of the <HI>History</HI> of his <HI>Providence,</HI> the
Truth of which it was deemed the highest Crime to violate; the Invention and
Construction of an <HI>Epic Fable</HI> could never be the Result of a
natural and un∣taught Progression.</P>
<P>If the <HI>Epic</HI> Form was thus naturally prevented by the
Severity of Truth, the first Form of <HI>Tragedy,</HI> and <HI>dramatic
Exhibition</HI> must of Course be checked from the same Principle: For we
have seen that the native and original tragic Species is but an Union of the
Ode and Epic Fable, animated by personal Representation. To this we may
subjoin, that an additional Absurdity would here present itself: The
Absurdity of cloathing the <HI>Deity</HI> in a visible and <HI>human
Form:</HI> A Circumstance strictly forbidden by the <HI>Jewish</HI>
Law.</P>
<P>If it be said, that although these Reasons are good, against
their introducing the <HI>Deity</HI> as the leading Subject either of
<HI>Epic</HI> or <HI>dramatic Fable,</HI> yet still their <HI>Heroes</HI>
might have furnished Subjects for <HI>Both:</HI> We may reply, that all the
great Actions of their Heroes were so inti∣mately connected with the
important History of Provi∣dence, which this People were destined both to
<HI>execute</HI> and <HI>preserve,</HI> that even <HI>These</HI> became
improper Subjects for the Mixture and Alloy of Fable. And farther; The very
Tendency of Fancy towards such a Progression of <PB N="178" REF="181"/>
Poetry was quenched <HI>here</HI> also, in its first Conception. For the
first and original Enthusiasms of an untaught Tribe are awakened by the
Belief, that their deceased Heroes are advanced to the Rank of <HI>Gods,</HI>
and still main∣tain their former <HI>Relation</HI> and <HI>Affection</HI> to
their native <HI>Country:</HI> Hence the Imagination is kindled by Hope of
their Favour and Assistance: Hence Adoration riseth; flattering Fables
of their Power, Prowess, and Atchieve∣ments, are invented; and the Genius of
<HI>Epic</HI> and <HI>Tragic</HI> Song is awakened into Action. But where (as
among the JEWS) their greatest Men are represented as what they were, weak,
ignorant, and mortal; often humbled for their Sins; always under the Controul
of an over-ruling Providence; and after Death, lost to every earthly
Con∣nexion; here, the first natural Enthusiasms of the Soul could meet
with no Objects to excite them: A Collision was wanting: And the artless
Mind, instructed only in sacred Things, returned of itself to the unmixed
and in∣artificial Celebration of the <HI>all-wise</HI> and
<HI>all-powerful</HI> GOD.</P>
<P>As, from these Causes, the Forms of their <HI>Song</HI> never
had any Progression; so, it seems probable, that their <HI>Melody</HI>
stood still, in the same Manner. Its Application was chiefly to the
Service of Religion; and as their Hymn continued unchanged in its Genius, we
may reasonably believe that the Melody which accompanied it, had the same
Fate. For though there was nothing particular ordained, with Respect to
Music, in the <HI>Mosaic</HI> Law; yet, where almost every other
Circumstance relative to Worship was particularly prescribed, this
Severity of In∣stitution would give a Kind of Sanctity to every ancient
Custom that stood connected with it; and hence their Modes of Melody would
probably remain unchanged. <PB N="179" REF="182" MS="y"/> CLEMENS ALEXANDRINUS
informs us, that their Hymns were composed in the <HI>Dorian</HI> Mode<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>STROMAT. l. vi.</BIBL></NOTE>: Which, what∣ever it was, we
know to have been one of the most <HI>an∣cient,</HI> as well as
<HI>grave</HI> and <HI>sedate</HI>; and therefore fit for the Service of the
Temple.—Their Instruments were various, but simple: That which DAVID
chiefly used, appears to have been the <HI>Nabla</HI> or <HI>Trigonon</HI>; a
three-cornered Instrument, of the <HI>Harp</HI>-Species. Its Compass we
know from his own Authority; and that it was an Instrument of <HI>ten
Strings.</HI> We may be assured, too, that his Melody was not only
simple, but single: For he must have held his Harp with one Hand, and
played with the other, when he led the <HI>religious Dance</HI> before the
Ark.</P>
<P>As their <HI>Song</HI> and <HI>Melody,</HI> so their
<HI>Dance</HI> seems to have been chiefly employed in the Service of
Religion. The most frequent Exercise of this religious Rite devolved upon
the Women. It appears too, that the Prophets had some Kind of <HI>solemn
Movements,</HI> suited to the State and Circumstances of their divine
Enthusiasm: This Branch of the triple musical Alliance seems (as in
other Countries) to have made the earliest Separation. It ap∣pears to have
been chiefly exercised by the lower Ranks, in the Time of DAVID: And hence it
was, that MICHAL, the Daughter of SAUL, like a true fine Lady, despised
that Monarch, for exercising a Mode of Piety, which in her Days was <HI>no
longer fashionable.</HI></P>
<P>As to the united or complex Character of <HI>Legislator</HI> and
<HI>Bard,</HI> it is remarkable, that this was preserved among the JEWS
through a longer Succession of Ages than in any other Nation, from the
same Cause which prevented any <PB N="180" REF="183"/> Progression or
Change in the Forms of their Song: For the musical Art being chiefly
exercised in the Praises of the true GOD, was in less Danger of being
<HI>corrupted,</HI> and therefore not only its <HI>Utility</HI> was longer
<HI>preserved,</HI> but likewise its <HI>Professors</HI> were in less
Danger of being <HI>debased,</HI> than in other Countries where trifling or
immoral Ap∣plications of the Art ensued. Consequently, the Rulers of the
People could have no Temptation to quit any Part of that Character or Office,
which still maintained its pristine Use and Dignity. Accordingly, we
find, that from MOSES down to SOLOMON, during a Period of at least a
thousand Years, the <HI>complex</HI> Character of <HI>Legislator</HI> and
<HI>Bard</HI> often appeared in the most distinguished Leaders of their
State, and from first to last remained unbroken. MOSES, their first great
Lawgiver, led the Song of Triumph, on the Overthrow of the <HI>Egyptians</HI>
in the <HI>Red-Sea</HI><NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>EXODUS.</BIBL></NOTE>:
MIRIAM, a distinguished Prophetess, led the female Dance and Choir, on
the same Occasion<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Ibid.</BIBL></NOTE>. While
the <HI>Judges</HI> ruled in ISRAEL, this complex Office still remained:
DEBORAH is an Instance of this Truth: She <HI>judged</HI> ISRAEL; and sung
her noble Song of Triumph, on the Death of SISERA and JABIN. We find, that
whoever was raised to the Station of a <HI>Judge,</HI> or <HI>Chief,</HI> was
commonly invested not only with the <HI>prophetic</HI> but the
<HI>bard-like</HI> Character: For we know, that the Prophets generally sung
their pro∣phetic Raptures to the Harp<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>1 SAM.
x.—1 CHRON. xxv.</BIBL></NOTE>. In After-times, when SAUL was elected
<HI>King,</HI> he too assumed at once the pro∣phetic and musical Office.
The Songs and bard-like Powers of DAVID, his <HI>kingly</HI> Successor, are
too well known <PB N="181" REF="184"/> to need an Illustration. The same
musical and poetic Character maintained its Union with that of <HI>King,</HI>
in his Son SOLOMON; whose <HI>Songs,</HI> we are told, were no less than a
<HI>thousand and five.</HI> After him the <HI>complex</HI> Office of
<HI>Legislator</HI> and <HI>Bard</HI> seems to have <HI>separated:</HI>
The peculiar Causes which had so long upheld it in the <HI>Jewish</HI>
State, now began to cease: For <HI>Idolatry</HI> more and more pre∣vailed,
<HI>Manners</HI> became <HI>corrupt,</HI> and public Misery and Ruin
ensued. The <HI>Prophets</HI> and <HI>Bards</HI> were now no lon∣ger found in
the Courts of Kings, or among the Rulers of the People: Yet still they
continued to throw out the Emanations of prophetic and moral Truth, accompanied
with the Enthusiasm of <HI>Song,</HI> in the more retired, and yet
uncorrupt Situations of private Life: And such were the <HI>later
Prophets,</HI> whose Writings still remain in Scrip∣ture.</P>
<P>As this appears to be a true Analysis of the State of
<HI>Music</HI> among the ancient HEBREWS; it will now lead us to an easy
Solution of a Fact which hath been regarded as mysterious by some of the
Learned; 
<Q REND="inline">"That while most other Nations had their
<HI>Bards</HI> or <HI>Poets</HI>; the JEWS, though their Compositions are
uncommonly sublime, never had any <HI>Poets by Profession,</HI> nor even
a Word in their Language which denotes the Character<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>CALMET. <HI>Dissert. sur la Poesie,</HI>
&amp;c.</BIBL></NOTE>."</Q> The Principles here given afford a clear Solution
of this Sin∣gularity. Their <HI>Prophets</HI> were indeed their <HI>Bards</HI>;
and appear to have been invested with all the Dignity belong∣ing to that
Office in its most honoured State. But as the Almighty GOD, and the great
Events of his <HI>Providence,</HI> <PB N="182" REF="185" MS="y"/> were the
continued <HI>Object</HI> of their <HI>Songs</HI>; so, the <HI>poetic</HI> or
<HI>musical</HI> Character was but <HI>secondary</HI> to the
<HI>religious:</HI> Therefore the Name of <HI>Bard</HI> was swallowed up and
lost in the higher Title of 
<Q REND="inline">"<HI>The</HI> PROPHET <HI>of the</HI> MOST
HIGH."</Q></P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="11" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT, XI. Of the State of Music and Poetry in ancient
ROME.</HEAD>
<P>WE have now traced the Progress of <HI>Melody</HI> and
<HI>Song,</HI> through the most remarkable Periods of those various
Nations, in which their <HI>Rise, Union,</HI> and <HI>Progress</HI> was
<HI>native</HI> and <HI>original.</HI> Let us now view them in their more
<HI>weak, borrowed,</HI> and <HI>separate</HI> State: This Inquiry will bring
us down to our own Times: And here we must occasionally quit the ancient
Names of <HI>Melody</HI> and <HI>Song</HI>; and sometimes adopt those
Titles which the two Arts (now separate) received in the later Ages of
GREECE, and which they have ever since retained among the polished Nations
of EUROPE, I mean those of MUSIC and POETRY.</P>
<P>The first Flight which <HI>Music</HI> and <HI>Poetry</HI> took
from GREECE was to ROME: For in this imperial City, they were not
<HI>native.</HI> The Causes of this original Defect, together with the State
and Progressions of these Arts at ROME, on their Arrival from GREECE,
will make the Sub∣ject of this Section.</P>
<P>The only Cause that hath been assigned for the Want of Music
and Poetry among the <HI>Romans</HI> in the early Ages of the Republic, hath
been 
<Q REND="inline">"that their Attention to War and Conquest
swallowed up all other Regards; and <PB N="183" REF="186"/> therefore Music
and Poetry were of course neglected."</Q> This Reasoning might hold, if
these Arts made no more than a mere <HI>Amusement</HI> in the
<HI>early</HI> Ages, as they gene∣rally do in the <HI>later</HI> Periods of a
State. But as it appears in the Course of this Dissertation, that Melody
and Song are the natural Produce of savage Life, however warlike; that the
Continuance of this warlike Character tends ra∣ther to heighten than
extinguish their Power; and that the History of human Nature confirms this
Truth; We must therefore seek for this peculiar Defect in some other, and
more hidden Cause.</P>
<P>There is a Principle which relates to the Establishment and
Character of <HI>Colonies,</HI> which will hereafter appear at∣tended with
extensive Consequences, and which will assist us in unfolding the
true Foundation of this Defect.</P>
<P><HI>Melody, Dance,</HI> and <HI>Song,</HI> being the natural Effects
of savage Manners continuing through several Ages, it must follow, that
<HI>Colonies</HI> will in general be found to possess them in a very
imperfect State. Fox <HI>Colonies</HI> are seldom sent out, till that early
Period is past, when the <HI>Legislator's</HI> and <HI>Bard's</HI>
Character are <HI>united</HI> in the same Person. Hence, the
<HI>Leader</HI> of the new Colony not being possessed of the poetic and
musical Enthusiasm, can neither have <HI>Ability</HI> nor
<HI>Inclination</HI> to instil or propagate these Arts among his Followers.
Thus the first leading Flame of Enthusiasm is quenched: And the inferior
Ranks, being busied in the Affairs of their new Settlement, have not that
Leisure which the unemployed savage State affords, to turn their Attention
on these natural Pleasures: For Colonies of Men seldom depart from their
native Country, unless when driven by some Kind of <HI>Necessity:</HI>
And there∣fore <PB N="184" REF="187"/> must betake themselves, for
Subsistance, either to <HI>Industry</HI> or <HI>War.</HI> The last of
these was the chief Occu∣pation of the <HI>Roman</HI> State: And thus, not
because they were a <HI>warlike</HI> People, but because they were a
<HI>needy Colony,</HI> the <HI>musical Arts</HI> which were so
<HI>powerful</HI> in <HI>early</HI> GREECE, were so <HI>weak</HI> in
<HI>early</HI> ROME.</P>
<P>This Observation will hold true of most other Countries peopled
by foreign Nations after a certain Period of Civi∣lization. Thus CARTHAGE was a
Colony which went out from TYRE: And <HI>Music,</HI> which was of Weight in
the <HI>native</HI> City, was of no Consideration in the
<HI>descendant</HI> State. Thus again, the <HI>Irish, Welsh,</HI> and
<HI>Scots,</HI> are strictly <HI>natives</HI>; and accordingly, have a
Music of <HI>their own:</HI> The <HI>English,</HI> on the contrary, are a
foreign Mixture of late-established Colonies; and as a Consequence of
this, have <HI>no native Music.</HI> He who would find the <HI>original
Music</HI> of ENGLAND, must seek it in WALES.</P>
<P>Here, then, appears the true Cause of this Defect in the early
Ages of ROME. So ignorant were the <HI>Trojan</HI> Found∣ers of the Empire in
the musical Arts, that they had not even the first Rudiments of
<HI>Song:</HI> For we are told by a learned <HI>Roman,</HI> that when ENEAS
brought the Images of the Gods to Shore, 
<Q REND="inline">"the <HI>Women howled</HI> and <HI>danced</HI> at
the Solemnity<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>DIONYS. <HI>Halicarn.</HI> l. i. c.
55.</BIBL></NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>The History of the musical Arts in ROME confirms this general
Principle: Their Music and Poetry was always <HI>borrowed</HI> and
<HI>adopted:</HI> Let us trace its Progress through the several
succeeding ages.</P>
<P><PB N="185" REF="188"/>NUMA POMPILIUS first introduced these Arts
into the <HI>Roman</HI> religious Ceremonies. Had he been a <HI>Native</HI> of
ROME, he had been a clear Exception to the Principle here given: But instead
of overturning, he confirms it: For he was a retired, philosophic, and
illustrious <HI>Sabine:</HI> And the <HI>Salian</HI> Priests which he
established, were <HI>Musicians</HI> or <HI>Bards,</HI> who had been
brought by EVANDER from ARCADIA into ITALY<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>DIONYS. <HI>Hal.</HI> l. i.</BIBL></NOTE>. Thus, the
<HI>Salian</HI> Songs were not <HI>native,</HI> but <HI>transplanted</HI>
into ROME.</P>
<P>We find no farther Progress in the musical and poetic Arts, for
many Ages: Save only, that a vague Rumour prevailed in the later Periods of the
Commonwealth, that in ancient Times it had been usual to sing the Praises
of great Men at Feasts<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>CICERO <HI>de Leg.</HI>
l. ii.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P>The next Progression of the musical Arts in ROME, was the
<HI>Adoption</HI> of the <HI>Thuscan Shews:</HI> These, as LIVY in∣forms
us, were called in from ETRURIA during a fatal Pestilence, with a View of
appeasing the angry Gods<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>LIV. <HI>Hist.</HI>
l. vii.</BIBL></NOTE>. The borrowed Flame was soon caught and spread among
the <HI>Roman</HI> Youth; who by Degrees gave <HI>Voice</HI> to the <HI>mute
Action</HI> of the <HI>Thuscans.</HI></P>
<P>To these the <HI>Atellane</HI> Plays succeeded; being in the
same Manner <HI>borrowed</HI> and adopted by the <HI>Roman</HI> People from
the OSCI, a neighbouring Province: Both these, and the <HI>Thuscan
Shews</HI> seem to have been <HI>native</HI> in their respective
Districts; and therefore we need go no farther in Quest of their true
Origin, than to the untaught Progression and Se∣paration of <HI>Melody,
Dance,</HI> and <HI>Song:</HI> But on their first 
<PB N="186" REF="189" MS="y"/> Entrance into ROME, these dramatic shews were
no longer in their <HI>natural,</HI> but in an <HI>ingrafted</HI> State. The
first Idea, then, of <HI>Comedy</HI> was caught by <HI>Adoption</HI> in this
Republic: Here, as in the Adoption of the <HI>Salian Songs,</HI> they were mere
<HI>Imitators.</HI> And thus, contrary to the natural Course of Things (as we
have proved above<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Sect. vii.</BIBL></NOTE>)
<HI>Comedy</HI> had, by Accident, an Establishment prior to
<HI>Tragedy</HI> in ancient ROME.</P>
<P>As it appears that in the first Periods of theatrical and dramatic
Representation, it is natural for the <HI>Poet</HI> to <HI>act</HI> a Part in
his own Plays<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Sect. vi.</BIBL></NOTE>; so
LIVIUS ANDRONICUS, the first known dramatic Poet of ROME<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Art. 26.</BIBL></NOTE>, maintained this natural
<HI>Union</HI> of the <HI>Poet</HI> and <HI>Actor,</HI> which he had received
from the adopted Shews. But so little were theatrical Representations the
Effect of Nature at ROME, and so much were they received as mere Shews of
<HI>Pleasure</HI> and <HI>Amusement,</HI> that even at this early Period an
unexampled <HI>Separation</HI> commenced; a Separation more absurd than any
that had taken Place in GREECE. For now, 
<Q REND="inline">"LIVIUS acting his own Play according to the
Custom of the Times, was compelled by the People to repeat some favourite
Passages, till his Voice grew hoarse: On which, he obtained Leave to
substitute a Slave to <HI>sing</HI> the Poem along with the
<HI>Musician,</HI> while he himself performed the <HI>Action</HI> in dumb
Shew<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>LIV. <HI>Hist.</HI> l.
vii.</BIBL></NOTE>."</Q> Thus an <HI>absurd Separa∣tion</HI> was
established; and continued so established through the succeeding
Ages of the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>LUCIAN <HI>de
Salt.</HI></BIBL></NOTE>. Hence ROSCIUS himself, of whom the World hath heard
so <PB N="187" REF="190"/> much, was often no more than an Imitator by
<HI>mute</HI> Action. We may safely pronounce it impossible that this
Separation could have come on, unless the theatric Representations had
already degenerated into a mere <HI>Amusement.</HI> When a <HI>slave</HI>
was permitted to <HI>sing</HI> the <HI>Poem,</HI> we may be sure the chief
Attention was turned on the <HI>Gesticulation</HI> of the <HI>Actor.</HI>
That which in a <HI>sound</HI> State of things had been
<HI>subordinate,</HI> was now become <HI>principal.</HI></P>
<P>However, the theatrical Shews in this Period seem to have had
little Effect; the Manners of the People con∣tinuing much the same with
those of more ancient Times. After the Succession of a few Ages, the
principal Pro∣gressions came on; and these arose from their
Acquaint∣ance with, and their Conquest of GREECE.</P>
<P>As this Event happened many Years after the musical Arts had
lost their <HI>Union,</HI> their proper <HI>Ends,</HI> and original
<HI>Genius</HI> in the <HI>Mother-Country</HI>; so it was natural, that the
<HI>Romans</HI> (now verging towards a Decline of Manners) should greedily
borrow and adopt them, in that <HI>separate, imperfect,</HI> and
<HI>perverted</HI> State which these Arts held when the <HI>Greeks</HI> were
conquered by the <HI>Romans.</HI> Let us there∣fore trace them from their
first to their last Progressions in ROME; where we shall find, that
from being of mere Amusement or little Utility, they degenerated by Degrees
into Things pernicious.</P>
<P>In the early Periods of GREECE, the Poet composed the Melody for
his Plays: In the Decline of the Greek States, the Melody was the distinct
Labour of another Person<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>See above, Sect. vi.
Art. 35.</BIBL></NOTE>. This Separation the <HI>Romans</HI> maintained: A
Conduct <PB N="188" REF="191"/> natural among those who considered these
Arts as the In∣struments of Pleasure only. The necessary Consequence
of this was the gradual Introduction of an effeminate and luxuriant Melody; of
which both CICERO<NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot"><BIBL><HI>De Leg.</HI> l.
ii.</BIBL></NOTE> and HORACE<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Epist. ad
Pis.</BIBL></NOTE> in their respective Times complain.</P>
<P>In Consequence of these, a new and fatal Separation en∣sued.
The <HI>Player,</HI> who in the uncorrupted Ages of GREECE was often of the
<HI>first Rank</HI> in the Republic, was generally of <HI>slavish</HI>
Birth at <HI>Rome</HI>; and was by Law ex∣cluded from the Freedom of the
City<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>LIV. <HI>Hist.</HI> l.
xxiv.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P>A whimsical Change was made in the Form of the <HI>Masque:</HI>
For in order to give a <HI>Variety</HI> of <HI>Expression,</HI> which
became necessary as the Fable of their Comedy grew more
<HI>complicated,</HI> the two Sides were marked with <HI>different
Pas∣sions.</HI> 
<Q REND="inline">"The Father, who is a principal Character in the
Comedy, as he is sometimes <HI>pleased,</HI> and sometimes
<HI>angry,</HI> hath one of his Eyebrows even, and the other <HI>raised</HI>
aloft: and the <HI>Roman</HI> Actors take Care to shew <HI>that Side</HI> of
the <HI>Masque</HI> to the Audience which suits with his <HI>present
Temper</HI><NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>QUINTIL. <HI>Inst.</HI> l. ii. c.
11.</BIBL></NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>With Respect to the <HI>Subjects</HI> of their <HI>Tragedy,</HI>
they were here no less mere Imitators. For although they had one Species in
which their own Great Men were the <HI>Heroes</HI> of the Poem, yet even this
was not original, but altogether built on the <HI>Grecian</HI> Model. But
farther, we learn from HORACE, that the most approved Subjects were those
which were drawn from HOMER's Poems. He gives this as a Rule to the Poets of
his Time and <PB N="189" REF="192" MS="y"/> Country; 
<Q REND="inline">"That to throw the Fables of the <HI>Iliad</HI> into
tragic Scenes is a safer and better Practice, than to at∣tempt Subjects yet
untouched."</Q> A Passage which con∣tains the clearest Proof, that
Tragedy was now separated from its highest Purposes; and that the
<HI>great Ends</HI> of this <HI>Poem,</HI> which gave it so much
<HI>Power</HI> in GREECE, were utterly lost to the Roman People.</P>
<P>The primary Applications of <HI>Tragedy</HI> being thus little known
in ROME, even on its first Admission; we cannot wonder that it became a
weak and languid Amusement: Especially, among a People whose Manners
were, now sinking into That Character which tended to give <HI>Comedy</HI>
the Ascendant, as in the declining Period of the <HI>Greek</HI> States. Thus
the true Cause appears, why <HI>Comedy</HI> was cultivated so much more
than <HI>Tragedy,</HI> in every Period of this Republic.</P>
<P>The <HI>Ode</HI> or <HI>hymnal</HI> Species seems to have been as
ef∣fectually separated from the Ends of <HI>Public Utility,</HI> as the
<HI>Tragic</HI> Poem. HORACE often declares his Inability to attempt any thing
<HI>Great</HI> in this Kind. The general Cha∣racter of his Odes corresponds
much with his own Sen∣timent: They are always elegant, seldom majestic. His
<HI>Irreligion</HI> even <HI>disqualified</HI> him from excelling in the
<HI>highest Species</HI> of the <HI>Ode:</HI> For of this, we have seen,
<HI>Religion</HI> must be the <HI>Object:</HI> And although there be a
variety of fine <HI>moral</HI> Apothegms, and frequent Allusions to the
<HI>public State</HI> of ROME; yet these are always <HI>checked,</HI> and
made <HI>subservient</HI> to the Favour of MAECENAS and AUGUSTUS. In a
Word, they are but <HI>secondary: Urbanity</HI> of Senti∣ment,
<HI>Elegance</HI> of <HI>Phrase,</HI> and of <HI>Compliment</HI> to his
Mas∣ters, were manifestly his <HI>first Object.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="190" REF="193"/>With Regard to the Character of the famed
<HI>Roman Epic</HI> Poem; notwithstanding the inordinate Praises that have
been lavished on VIRGIL's <HI>Aeneid,</HI> it may with Truth be affirmed,
that neither the <HI>original</HI> nor <HI>legislative</HI> Spirit of ancient
GREECE appear with any uniform Splen∣dor through the Course of this
celebrated Work. Elegant in Diction, a Master in Rythm and Numbers, nervous
in Figures, majestic in Description, pathetic in tragic Inci∣dents,
strong in the Delineation of Character, accom∣plished in all the
<HI>secondary Qualities</HI> of an <HI>Epic Poet</HI>; yet still VIRGIL
wanted that all-comprehensive Genius which alone can conceive and strike
out a great original Epic Plan, no less than that independent Greatness of
Soul which was quenched by the <HI>ruinous Policy</HI> of the Times, and which
alone can animate true Genius to a full Exertion of its Powers in the Cause
of <HI>public Virtue</HI> and <HI>Mankind.</HI> Through the first of these
Defects, the <HI>Aeneid</HI> abounds with Inci∣dents that are borrowed,
unconnected, broken, and ill-placed; through the second, though here and
there the Spirit of <HI>general Legislation</HI> appears, yet the great
Subjects <HI>peculiarly relative</HI> to the <HI>Roman</HI> State, the
<HI>Glories</HI> of the <HI>Republic,</HI> the <HI>Atchievements</HI> of its
<HI>Heroes,</HI> all these are cast into <HI>Shades,</HI> and seen as

<HI>highest Colourings</HI> of his Pencil are <HI>prostituted</HI> to the
<HI>Vanity</HI> of the <HI>ruling Tyrant.</HI></P>
<P>As both the <HI>Ode</HI> and <HI>Epic</HI> had thus degenerated from
their original Character in GREECE, so we shall find that the
<HI>Recitation</HI> of them kept Pace with this spurious Birth. We have
already seen, that in the more early Periods of the <HI>Greek</HI> Republics,
their Poems were <HI>sung</HI> to the sur∣rounding Audience for the
important Ends of <HI>Religion,</HI> <PB N="191" REF="194"/> <HI>Morals,</HI>
and <HI>Polity.</HI> In ROME, as in the later Periods of GREECE, we find the
<HI>Song</HI> brought down to <HI>Recitation,</HI> and these <HI>great
Purposes</HI> swallowed up and lost in the <HI>Vanity</HI> and
<HI>Self-Importance</HI> of the <HI>Poet.</HI> Hence we find their best
Writers declaring their Dislike to the Practice of <HI>public
Recitation,</HI> because Flattery was now become the Food of every reciting
Poetaster. The whole Farce and Foppery of this Practice, which was indeed no
other than the spurious Issue of the old <HI>Grecian Song-Feast,</HI>
is given at large by VOSSIUS, to whom, for Brevity's Sake, we refer<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><BIBL><HI>De Imitatione,</HI> c. 7, &amp;c.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P>The musical Arts, being thus <HI>separated,</HI> and
<HI>perverted</HI> from their <HI>proper Ends,</HI> no Wonder that we hear so
little of their being applied to the <HI>Education</HI> of <HI>Youth,</HI> in
any Period of ancient ROME.</P>
<P>On the contrary, as Manners and Principles grew more profligate,
along with the inordinate growing Power and Luxuries of the Empire; so the
Genius of the <HI>poetic</HI> and <HI>musical</HI> Arts kept Pace with them.
<HI>Poem,</HI> which in the Days of ancient GREECE had been the
<HI>Handmaid</HI> of <HI>Vir∣tue,</HI> was now declared to be the <HI>Bawd</HI>
of <HI>Licentiousness</HI>; and to write <HI>immodest</HI> Verses was
held a <HI>blameless</HI> Prac∣tice<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"> 
<L><HI>Castum decet esse Poetam: Ipsos Versiculos nihil
necesse est.</HI></L></NOTE>. Thus the Art sunk so low, that the Name
of <HI>Poet,</HI> was held unworthy a Man of <HI>Age</HI> or
<HI>Dignity</HI><NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot"> 
<L><HI>Turpe est Senem Versus scribere.</HI></L></NOTE>. The
<HI>mimetic</HI> and <HI>musical</HI> Arts grew not only an intolerable
Burthen, but became at length of most pernicious In∣fluence on the State. The
Attention to the <HI>mimetic</HI> Art was now carried to a most ridiculous
Extreme. CICERO informs us, that the Players practised several Years,
before <PB N="192" REF="195"/> they ventured upon the Stage<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>CIC. <HI>de Oratore,</HI> l. i.</BIBL></NOTE>: That the
Actors, in Imitation of the degenerate <HI>Greeks,</HI> gradually awakened
their Powers of Speech in the Morning, lest by too sudden an Exertion they
should endanger the Voice<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Ibid.</BIBL></NOTE>.
They gargled the Throat with a Composition proper for the Purpose: And the
Methods of managing and improving the Voice were now formed into a separate
Science<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>PERSIUS <HI>Sat.</HI> I.</BIBL></NOTE>.
In a Word, LIVY complains, that 
<Q REND="inline">"an Amusement which was harmless in its
Beginnings, had now grown to such a Madness of Expence, that the
wealthiest Kingdoms were hardly equal to it<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>L.
vii.</BIBL></NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>In the later Periods the Mischief grew still more intolerable:
For now, the serious Arts were cultivated by Few: Nothing was heard but light
and effeminate Music: The Singer took the Philosopher's Place; the
Libraries were shut up; and the general Attention was turned upon musical
Instruments proper to accompany and sustain the Gesticulation of the
Actors. The Effects of this Dissolute Taste soon appeared: For
QUINTILIAN tells us, that 
<Q REND="inline">"the effeminate and immodest Music of the Stage
had no inconsiderable Part in destroying that small Degree of manly
Character which had been left among them<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot"><BIBL><HI>Inst.</HI> l. i.</BIBL></NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>The Evil still increased: So that in the Time of NERO, 
<Q REND="inline">"The City swarmed with <HI>Pantomimes:</HI> Every
private House now became a Theatre; and the Husband and Wife contended,
which should most successfully <HI>pro∣stitute</HI> themselves to
the <HI>Favour</HI> of the <HI>Actors</HI><NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>SENECA
<HI>Nat. Quaest.</HI> l. vii.</BIBL></NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="193" REF="196" MS="y"/>There is a Time, when Nature
struggles hard to free herself from peccant and deadly Humours. This Time
was now come at ROME; but it came too late: The Body politic was expiring, and
was not able to shake off the Evil: The Pantomimes were twice expelled; but
still returned again<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>TAC. <HI>An.</HI> l. xiii,
xiv.</BIBL></NOTE>. At length, the barbarous Nations of the North broke in upon
the dying Empire. TOTILA attacked and pillaged ROME: The degenerate Arts sunk
with the degenerate City: And the Patrician Ladies, who lately had reveled
amidst the Spoils of a subjected World, now begged before their own
Doors.</P>
<P>The extravagant Passion of some of their later Emperors for
the musical Arts, and these too of the most debauched and profligate
Characters, particularly CALIGULA and NERO, is too well known to need a
Delineation: This Essay is not intended as a <HI>History</HI> of
<HI>Facts,</HI> but an <HI>Investi∣gation</HI> of the <HI>Causes</HI> that
produced them. On this Subject, therefore, there is one Circumstance which
may demand our attention. We have seen above, that the first original
Legislators turned their Attention strongly on the musical Arts; and we
now find, that the abandoned Rulers of a decaying Empire adopt them with no
less Eagerness: Doth not this Contrariety of Facts seem to shake some
of the Principles which we have attempted to establish? So far from this,
that it confirms them: For in both In∣stances, <HI>Music</HI> was made
<HI>subservient</HI> to the <HI>Views</HI> or ruling <HI>Passions</HI>
of those who <HI>led</HI> the People. The honest Legis∣lators of early
Times employed it for the Ends of public Utility; the profligate Emperors
abused it to the Purposes <PB N="194" REF="197"/> of Licentiousness.
Among the former, by a legitimate Use, it became the Instrument of
establishing Common-wealths: Among the latter, by a perverted Application,
it shook the Foundations of Empire: ORPHEUS drew the barbarous Tribes, from
Theft, Adultery, and Murder, by his Songs and Lyre: NERO plundered his
Patricians of their Estates to load his Musicians with Wealth; and amidst
the forced Acclamations of a corrupted Theatre, violated a vestal Virgin on
the Stage.</P>

<DIV1 N="12" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. XII. Of the State and Separation of Music and Poetry
among the polished Nations of EUROPE through the succeeding Ages.</HEAD>
<P>THUS the musical and poetic Arts sunk along with the
<HI>Roman</HI> Empire.—But Mankind, emerging from the Ruins of
<HI>Luxury, Profligacy,</HI> and <HI>Invasion,</HI> are of a different
Character from that of human Nature arising from mere <HI>Barbarity</HI> into
<HI>Civilization.</HI> We have traced the natural Progress of these Arts in
the <HI>last</HI> of these; but from the former, nothing consistent or
steady can arise. The Views, Manners, Principles, and Passions of a
furious Conqueror, meeting and mixing with those of a subdued and abandoned
People, produce such a Com∣pound of dissimilar and contending Causes,
as approach in their Effects to the Appearance of mere Chance or Fortune.</P>
<P>But the Circumstance most worth remarking is this, that in
such a Period, all the natural Seeds and Principles of the musical Arts are
lost. The whole <HI>local</HI> Fabric of <PB N="195" REF="198"/> <HI>Religion,
Polity,</HI> and <HI>Morals,</HI> is commonly sunk in the general Ruin; and a
barbarous Conqueror followed by an enraged Soldiery, who have left their own
Country to invade another, have generally the <HI>Vices</HI> of
<HI>Savages,</HI> with∣out their <HI>Virtues.</HI></P>
<P>Hence the <HI>musical</HI> Arts could not arise from the Ruins
of the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire, but from the ineffectual Principle of <HI>mere
Imitation.</HI> They wanted that <HI>native</HI> Force and Vigour which had
given them so free and full a Growth in ancient GREECE.</P>
<P>Such therefore being the Birth of the <HI>modern Poetry</HI> and
<HI>Music</HI> of EUROPE; having been the casual Offspring of the corrupted
<HI>Roman</HI> Arts, which were themselves no more than partial Imitations of
the <HI>Greek,</HI> in their State of Separation and Weakness; no Wonder if
the <HI>modern Transcript</HI> be <HI>inferior,</HI> not only to the
<HI>Original,</HI> but the <HI>first Copy.</HI></P>
<P>This general Principle being given, we might perhaps end our Inquiry
here: Leaving the more particular In∣vestigation to the good Sense and
Judgment of Mankind: But to give all possible Satisfaction on a Subject
which may by some be regarded as a Matter of Curiosity, we shall trace
the Rise and Progress of these Arts in their chief Appearances, so far
as they have Relation to each other.</P>
<P>Before the Roman Empire fell to Ruin, its Rulers took Care, to the
utmost of their Power, to extirpate the native Music of the barbarous
Countries which they conquered. Of this JULIUS CAESAR, AMMIANUS MARCELLINUS and
SUETONIUS inform us. This was a high Stroke of Policy: For their native Songs
being (as in ancient GREECE) the Repository of their Religious and Political 
<PB N="196" REF="199"/> System, nothing could so effectually
<HI>subdue</HI> the <HI>Minds</HI> of these Barbarians, as the Banishment
or Destruction of their <HI>Bards</HI> and <HI>Druids.</HI> We have already
seen Edward the First of ENGLAND acting the same Tragedy in WALES, on the
same Principle.</P>
<P>On the Revival of Learning, the three greater Kinds of
<HI>Poetry</HI> were, in many Instances, necessarily <HI>divorced</HI>
from <HI>Music.</HI> For the <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Roman</HI> Poets being
the only approved <HI>Models,</HI> could be read and imitated by <HI>Scholars
only.</HI> Thus, the <HI>Art</HI> which in ancient GREECE had been the genuine
Effect of natural Enthusiasm, and aided by a native and correspondent
Melody, had been delivered to the People by the inraptured Bard, could now be
studied and attained only by the <HI>sequestered Few,</HI> who were
swal∣lowed up by a literary Application, often ignorant of the Powers of
Music, and little acquainted with Society and Mankind.—Hence the
<HI>Epic Poet</HI> (the Manners of the Times likewise forbidding<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>See below, Sect. xiii.</BIBL></NOTE>) could no longer appear
at the Place of public Concourse, with his Lyre and festal Robes, to charm
the listening Audience with his legislative Songs; but retired to the
<HI>Closet,</HI> and with a more com∣posed Mien delivered his
Inspirations in written Verse, for the Pleasure, Admiration, and
Instruction of Mankind.—This might have been indured: Because some
of the general Ends of that calmer Species may be obtained by a
<HI>Home-application.</HI> But the Misfortune was, that even <HI>Tragedy</HI>
and <HI>Ode,</HI> whose End is to shake the Soul with Terror, Pity, or Joy,
by a <HI>theatrical Exhibition</HI><NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot"> 
<P>It hath become a favourite Topic among certain Persons, to
decry the theatrical Exhibition of Tragedy, as an Object below the Ambition of
a Poet. Whether any fastidious tragic Muse hath <HI>privately</HI> knocked
at the Door of the Theatre, and been <HI>refused Admittance,</HI> we shall
not here <HI>affirm:</HI> But it belongs to our Subject to shew on what
Foundation the theatrical Exhibition makes an essential Part of Tragedy;
and that with∣out it, the tragic Poem is an <HI>imperfect Species.</HI></P> 
<P>The Epic Poem not only imitates Actions, Sentiments, Characters,
and Passions; but likewise delineates their chief external and attendant
Cir∣cumstances of Place, Person, Voice, Countenance, Attitude, and
Gesture: And hence a full and perfect Imitation ensues. In the Dramatic or
Tragic Poem, little of this latter Kind can be admitted, without violating the
Probability and Power of the Dialogue: On this Foundation, the Description of
these external and attendant Circumstances is necessarily left to the
Conduct of the <HI>Actor</HI>; who, in these Articles, assumes the
Pro∣vince of the Poet, and is a real <HI>Imitator.</HI> Hence a dramatic Poem,
<HI>written,</HI> but <HI>not represented,</HI> is capitally defective in the
great Article of <HI>Imitation;</HI> and is therefore a Species
<HI>essentially imperfect.</HI>—ARISTOTLE hath over∣looked this
capital Distinction between the Epic and Tragic Poem, in his Comparison of
these two Species. 
<BIBL><HI>Poet.</HI> c. xxvi.</BIBL></P></NOTE>, and the 
<PB N="197" REF="200"/> <HI>Powers</HI> of <HI>Music</HI>;—even these,
in many Instances and in different Periods, were <HI>divorced</HI> from their
<HI>Assistant Arts,</HI> and became the <HI>languid Amusement</HI> of
the <HI>Closet.</HI> For be∣ing often written by retired and speculative
Men, unac∣quainted with the Workings of the human Soul, and at∣tending only to
the <HI>external Form</HI> and <HI>poetic Ornaments</HI> of the <HI>Greek
Drama</HI>; their Vanity hath been either to <HI>soar</HI> or <HI>dive</HI>
into <HI>Obscurity,</HI> to substitute mere <HI>Imagery,</HI> in the
Place of <HI>Passion,</HI> to plan and write in a <HI>cold</HI> Style, so
far removed from Nature, as to be incapable of a <HI>living
Re∣presentation</HI>; in a Word, to compose <HI>Tragedies</HI> that cannot
be <HI>acted,</HI> and <HI>Odes</HI> that cannot be <HI>sung.</HI></P>
<P>This false Taste in <HI>Ode-writing</HI> hath so strongly
esta∣blished itself in ENGLAND, that an <HI>Ode</HI> of the <HI>true</HI>
Cha∣racter is stiled (by Way of Distinction) An Ode for <HI>Music:</HI>
Of this Kind we have two noble ones in our Language, <PB N="198" REF="201"/> by
DRYDEN and POPE: But these will be considered more at large below.</P>
<P>As the modern Poetry thus became often unfit for Music, so from
a singular Cause the Separation was con∣firmed, and Music in its Turn
became often unfit for Poe∣try. After many Centuries had passed in
Darkness, GUIDO arose: And with a Force of Genius surpassing that of
all his Predecessors, invented the Art of <HI>Counter∣point,</HI> or
<HI>Composition</HI> in <HI>Parts:</HI> Yet this very Circumstance, which
seemed to promise so noble an Improvement in Music, was a strong
concurrent Cause of compleating its Divorce from Poetry. For now,
<HI>instrumental</HI> Music, having assumed a new and more inviting
Form, and be∣ing ennobled by the principles of a complex and varied
<HI>Harmony,</HI> was introduced as being of itself a <HI>compleat</HI>
Species, independent of Poetry or Song. This gave it an <HI>artificial</HI> and
<HI>laboured</HI> Turn; while the Composer went in Quest of curious
Harmonies, Discords, Resolutions, Fugues, and Canons; and prided himself
(like the Poet) in a pompous Display of Art, to the Neglect of
<HI>Expression</HI> and true <HI>Pathos.</HI> And thus modern Music, on
its first Rise, was in a Manner divorced from <HI>Poetry,
Legislation,</HI> and <HI>Morals.</HI></P>
<P>These Causes sufficiently account for the present State of
the two Sister Arts, in every Instance of their <HI>total Separation.</HI>
Let us now consider them in those Situations where their Union is indeed in
some Sort maintained, but this in an improper and ineffectual Manner.</P>
<P>The four distinct Forms in which these two Arts still maintain
an imperfect Union are, 1. The common <HI>Song</HI> or <HI>Canzonette.</HI> 2.
The <HI>Opera,</HI> or <HI>Drama</HI> for the <HI>Stage.</HI> 
<PB N="199" REF="202"/> 3. The <HI>Anthem,</HI> or <HI>Motet,</HI> for the
<HI>Church.</HI> 4. The <HI>Ora∣torio,</HI> or <HI>sacred Drama.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. The common <HI>Song</HI> or <HI>Canzonette</HI> hath sunk
from the original Dignity which it maintained in ancient GREECE, from two
evident Causes. First, The Separation of Music and Poetry from their
important Ends, and from each other, naturally prevented the modern Poets and
Musicians from considering this Species as being much worthy of their
Attention. Secondly, The nobler Applications of the <HI>Song</HI> being thus
relinquished and lost, no Wonder if Men of high Station and moral Dignity
disdained the Practice of it (even where they had Ability) as being an Object
unworthy of their Regard. Hence it hath come to pass, that this Species is
hardly supposed to touch on any Subject religious, political, or moral,
unless it be in Jest<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">There are some Exceptions to
this general Observation; but they take Place chiefly among the
<HI>Vulgar</HI>; among whom the <HI>Ballad-Song</HI> com∣monly retains its
<HI>moral</HI> and <HI>political</HI> Applications.</NOTE>. And thus the
reigning Topics of the <HI>Song</HI> are generally <HI>Love</HI> and
<HI>Wine.</HI> The <HI>French</HI> and <HI>English</HI> have adopted both
these Subjects: The <HI>Chansons à boire</HI> of the former, and the
<HI>drinking Catches</HI> of the latter, are Proofs of their Jollity rather
than Taste: Yet they clearly display the different Characters of the two
Nations. A parallel Remark might perhaps be made on their <HI>Love-Songs:</HI>
With this Exception, however, that in a Song of this Kind, PURCEL hath left us
one of the finest and best va∣ried Pieces of musical Expression that
ever was com∣posed<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot"> From rosy Bowers,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE>: And in Justice to the present Times it must be
farther observed, that in ENGLAND, this Species is <PB N="200" REF="203"/> now
in a good Degree rescued from its former Indelicacy. The <HI>Italians</HI>
and <HI>Scots</HI> have chiefly turned the <HI>Song</HI> on the Subject of
<HI>Love.</HI> With Respect to the <HI>Poetry,</HI> the <HI>Italian
Canzonettes</HI> are more elegantly written than the <HI>Scotch,</HI> though
with less Nature and Passion. In the <HI>Music</HI> of the <HI>Italian
Canzonettes</HI> there is little Variety: They soon disgust, by their
Sameness of Expression: The <HI>Scotch Airs</HI> are perhaps the truest
Model of artless and pathetic musical Expression, that can be found in
the whole Compass of the Art. Some of them are said to have been the
Composition of DAVID RIZZIO, who is sup∣posed to have ingrafted the
<HI>Italian</HI> Regularity and Elegance of Song, on the original wild and
pathetic Manner of the <HI>Scots.</HI> This Tradition carries the Appearance of
Truth: For the <HI>Scotch</HI> Airs are of two different Kinds, easily
distin∣guishable from each other: The one <HI>regular,</HI> and subject
to the Rules of Counterpoint: The other wild and desultory, and such as do
not easily receive the Accompanyment of a Bass. The first of these may
seem to have been the Com∣position or Reform of RIZZIO; but in Force of
Ex∣pression and Pathos, the latter generally excel them: A Circumstance
which proves how little the Rules of mo∣dern Counterpoint have to do with the
<HI>Powers</HI> of <HI>Music.</HI></P>
<P N="2">The State of the <HI>Opera</HI> will deserve a more
particular Elucidation: And to this End we must endeavour to trace it to its
Origin, which lies in great Measure hid in Darkness. RICCOBONI is of
Opinion that the first ever represented, was that which the <HI>Doge</HI>
and <HI>Senate</HI> of VENICE exhibited for the Entertainment of HENRY the
third of FRANCE, in the Year 1574<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot"><BIBL><HI>Theat.</HI>
&amp;c.</BIBL></NOTE>. But this Ac∣count <PB N="201" REF="204" MS="y"/> is by no
means satisfactory: For SULPITIUS, an Italian, speaks of the <HI>musical
Drama,</HI> as an Entertainment known in ITALY in the Year 1490<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>MENETRIER <HI>de Representations en
Musique.</HI></BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P>History traces the Rise of the <HI>Opera</HI> no farther: But a
Circumstance mentioned by SULPITIUS, who was a Man of Letters, may seem to
lead us up to its true Origin. He is by some supposed to have been the
Inventor of this <HI>musical Drama</HI>; but he ingenuously tells us
himself, that he only <HI>revived</HI> it<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Ibid.</BIBL></NOTE>. We have seen above, that the
<HI>Tragedy</HI> of the ancient <HI>Greeks</HI> was accompanied with Music;
that the same Union was borrowed and main∣tained through the several
Periods of the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire: If therefore we suppose, what is
altogether probable, that the Form of the ancient Tragedy had been still kept
up in some retired Part of ITALY, which the Barbarians never conquered; we
then obtain a fair Account of the Rise of the modern <HI>Opera,</HI> which
hath so much con∣founded all Inquiry.</P>
<P>As VENICE was the Place where the <HI>Opera</HI> first appeared in
Splendor, so it is highly probable, that <HI>there</HI> the <HI>an∣cient
Tragedy</HI> had slept in Obscurity, during the Darkness of the Barbarous
Ages. For while the rest of ITALY was over-run by the Nations from the North,
the Seas and Morasses of VENICE preserved <HI>Her</HI> alone from their
In∣cursions: Hence, History tells us, the People flocked to VENICE from
every Part of ITALY: Hence the very Form of her Republic hath been maintained
for thirteen hundred Years: And from these Views of <HI>Security,</HI> it was
natural for the helpless Arts to seek an Asylum within 
<PB N="202" REF="205"/> her Canals, from the Fury and Ignorance of a barbarous
Conqueror.</P>
<P>Other Circumstances concur, to strengthen this Opinion. The
<HI>Carnaval</HI> first appeared in Splendor, and still wears it at VENICE,
beyond every other Part of ITALY: Now the <HI>Carnaval</HI> is, in many
Circumstances, almost a Transcript of the ancient <HI>Saturnalia</HI> of
ROME.</P>
<P>In the <HI>Venetian Comedy,</HI> the <HI>Actor</HI> wears a
<HI>Masque:</HI> A palpable <HI>Imitation,</HI> or rather
<HI>Continuance,</HI> of the old <HI>Roman</HI> Custom.</P>
<P>That the modern <HI>Opera</HI> is no more than a Revival of the old
<HI>Roman Tragedy,</HI> and not a new-invented Species, will appear still
more evident, if we consider, that it is an Exhi∣bition altogether out of
Nature, and repugnant to the universal Genius of Modern Customs and
Manners. We have seen the natural Union of Poetry and Music, as they rise
in the savage State; and how this Union forms the tragic Species in the
natural Progression of Things, Hence we have deduced the musical
Tragedies of ancient GREECE: But in ancient ROME, it appears, they arose
merely from <HI>Imitation</HI> and <HI>Adoption.</HI> Nor could it be
otherwise; because the <HI>Romans</HI> wanted the first seeds or
Principles from whence the musical Tragedies of the <HI>Greeks</HI> arose.
The same Reasoning takes Place, with Respect to the modern
<HI>Opera:</HI> It emerged at a Time, when the general State of Manners in
EUROPE could not naturally produce it. Had it been the Result from
<HI>Nature,</HI> its Production would have been more <HI>general.</HI> It
emerged in that very City, where most probably it must have lain hid: In a
City, whose other Entertainments are evidently borrowed from those of
ancient ROME. And if to these <PB N="203" REF="206"/> Arguments we add this
farther Consideration, that the Subjects of the very first <HI>Operas</HI>
were drawn from the Fables of ancient GREECE and ROME<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">The Subjects of the first <HI>Operas</HI> were APOLLO and
DAPHNE, ORPHEUS and EURIDICE, ALCESTES and ATYS; which last, in the Title
Page of the oldest extant Edition, is called <HI>a musical
Tragedy.</HI></NOTE>, and not from the Events or Atchievements of the Times;
and farther, that in their <HI>Form,</HI> they were exact Copies of the
<HI>ancient Drama</HI>; these accumulated Proofs amount to near a
De∣monstration, that the <HI>Italian Opera</HI> is but the <HI>Revival</HI>
of the old <HI>Roman Tragedy</HI><NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">As these
Circumstances prove that the <HI>modern Opera</HI> is a <HI>Revival</HI> of
the <HI>old Roman Tragedy</HI>; so, we are led from hence to a probable
Con∣jecture concerning the <HI>measured Recitation</HI> of the <HI>Roman
Tragedians:</HI> And that it was something of the Nature of modern
<HI>Recitative.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>Such being the <HI>Birth</HI> of the modern <HI>Opera,</HI> no
Wonder it inherits the <HI>Weakness</HI> of its <HI>Parent:</HI> For we have
seen, that the <HI>Roman Tragedy</HI> never had its proper Effects,
considered in a <HI>legislative</HI> View; having been separated from its
important Ends before its Arrival from GREECE. As therefore it had declined
into a mere <HI>Amusement</HI> when it was first adopted by ROME; and as we
have seen, that in Proportion as the Roman Manners grew more dissolute,
Tragedy sunk still lower in its Character, till at length it became no more
than a Kind of mere <HI>Substratum</HI> or <HI>Groundwork,</HI> on which the
Actors displayed their Abilities in <HI>Singing</HI> and
<HI>Gesticulation</HI>; it was altogether natural that it should rise
again in the same unnerved and effemi∣nate Form.</P>
<P>From these Causes, therefore, we may trace all the Features of
the modern <HI>Opera,</HI> however <HI>unnatural</HI> and <HI>distorted</HI>
they may appear. The <HI>Poem,</HI> the <HI>Music</HI> and the 
<PB N="204" REF="207" MS="y"/> <HI>Performance,</HI> as they now exist in
<HI>Union,</HI> are the manifest Effects of this spurious Origin.</P>
<P>First, That the <HI>Subject</HI> of the <HI>Poem</HI> should,
even on its first Appearance, be drawn from Times and Countries little
interesting, and <HI>Gods</HI> and <HI>Wonders</HI> and <HI>celestial
Machinery</HI> introduced, which neither the Poet nor his Audience
<HI>believed</HI> in, could only be the Effect of a <HI>blind</HI> Principle of
<HI>Imitation,</HI> tending to mere <HI>Amusement.</HI>—The
established Separation of the Poet's from the Musician's Art was
pro∣ductive of parallel Effects: For the Poet, ambitious only of shining in
his particular Sphere, became generally more Intent on Imagery than Pathos: Or
else, instead of being <HI>principal,</HI> he became
<HI>subservient</HI> to the Composer's Views; from whence arose a
Motley kind of Poem (calcu∣lated only for a Display of the Musician's Art)
which degenerated by Degrees into a mere <HI>Pasticio.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly; the same Causes account for all the Ab∣surdities of
the <HI>Music.</HI>—The <HI>Recitative,</HI> or perpetual mu∣sical
Accompanyment in the declamotary Parts, is a Practice so much at Variance
with modern Manners, that it extorted the following Censure from a candid
Critic: 
<Q REND="inline">"I beg Pardon of the Inventors of the <HI>mu∣sical
Tragedy,</HI> a Kind of Poem, as <HI>ridiculous</HI> as it is

with <HI>tragic Action,</HI> it is <HI>Song.</HI>" "The <HI>Opera</HI> is the
<HI>Grotesque</HI> of Poetry; and so much the more in∣tolerable, as it
pretends to pass for a regular Work<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>DACIER
<HI>Rem. sur Aristote,</HI> p. 85.</BIBL></NOTE>."</Q> Now if, along with
DACIER, we regard the <HI>Opera</HI> as a modern <HI>Invention,</HI> this
Circumstance of the perpetual musical Accompanyment is indeed
<HI>unaccountable:</HI> But if we regard it as a mere <HI>Imitation</HI> or
<HI>Continuance</HI> of the old <PB N="205" REF="208"/> <HI>Roman Tragedy,</HI>
and trace <HI>this</HI> upwards to its true Foun∣tain, the <HI>Greek
Drama</HI>; and again follow <HI>this</HI> to its original Source, the
<HI>savage Song-Feast</HI>; we then see how naturally these
<HI>extremes unite</HI>; and discern the rude <HI>Melody</HI> and
<HI>Song</HI> of the <HI>barbarous Greek</HI> Tribes gradually melted into the
<HI>Refinements</HI> of the <HI>modern Opera.</HI>—Again, as the
Sepa∣ration of the Poet's from the Musician's Art produced an <HI>improper
Poetry</HI>; so the Separation of the Musician's from the Poet's Character
was productive of improper and <HI>unaf∣fecting Music:</HI> For the
Composer, in his Turn, intent only on <HI>shining,</HI> commonly wanders
into unmeaning Division, and adopts either a delicate and refined, or a
merely popular Music, to the Neglect of true musical Expression. Hence,
too, the <HI>Da Capo</HI> had its natural Origin: A Practice which tends only
to tire and disgust the Hearer, if he comes with an Intent of being
<HI>affected</HI> by the <HI>tragic Action,</HI> or with any other View than
that of <HI>listening</HI> to a <HI>Song</HI><NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">The
<HI>Da Capo,</HI> which is so striking an Absurdity in the more modern
Operas, was not used in those of older Date. Even COLONNA, who lived about
the middle of the sixteenth Century, employed it not; as appears by one of
his Operas performed at the Academy in BOLOGNA, A. D. 1688. But in an Opera of
<HI>Old</HI> SCARLATTI (intitled <HI>La Teodora</HI>) composed in 1693, the
<HI>Da Capo</HI> is found, though not in all his Songs. After that Period, the
Use of it seems to have become <HI>general:</HI> For in an Opera of
GASPARINI (intitled <HI>Il Tartaro nella China</HI>) composed in 1715, the
<HI>Da Capo</HI> is found in every Song.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Thirdly, with Regard to the <HI>Performance</HI> of the
<HI>Opera.</HI>—The theatrical Representation is of a Piece with the
Poetry and Music: For, having been regarded, from its first Rise, more as
an Affair of astonishing Shew than of affecting Re∣semblance, it is
gaudy, flaunting, and unnatural. The Sing∣ers (like the <HI>Poet</HI> and
<HI>Musician)</HI> being considered merely as <PB N="206" REF="209"/>
Objects of Amusement, no Wonder if their Ambition seldom reacheth higher
than to the Display of an artificial Execution.—As a Consequence of
these Principles, the <HI>Castrati</HI> were introduced into all Sorts of
Characters, in spite of Nature and Probability; and still continue to
represent Heroes and Statesmen, Warriours and Women.—The flourished
Close or Cadence arose naturally from the same Sources: From a total
Neglect of the Subject and Expression, and an Attention to the mere
Circumstance of Execution only.—The frequent <HI>Encore,</HI> or Demand
of the repeated Performance of particular Songs was the natural Effect of the
same Causes. No Audience demands the <HI>Repetition</HI> of a pathetic
Speech in <HI>Tragedy,</HI> though per∣formed in the finest Manner, because
their Attention is turned on the Subject of the Drama: Thus if the Au∣dience
were <HI>warmed</HI> by the <HI>Subject</HI> of an <HI>Opera,</HI> and <HI>took
Part</HI> in the main <HI>Action</HI> of the Poem, the <HI>Encore,</HI>
instead of being <HI>desireable,</HI> would generally <HI>disgust:</HI>
But the whole being considered as a mere <HI>musical Entertainment,</HI>
and the tragic <HI>Action</HI> commonly <HI>forgot,</HI> the artificial
Performance of a <HI>Song</HI> became naturally a chief Object of Admiration,
and the Repetition of it a chief <HI>Object</HI> of Request.</P>
<P>Thus the whole Farrago of the <HI>modern Opera</HI> seems
resolved into its clear and evident Principles: And hence the
<HI>Subject,</HI> the <HI>Music,</HI> the <HI>Action,</HI> the
<HI>Dress,</HI> the <HI>Execution, Decorations,</HI> and <HI>Machinery,</HI>
are such a glar∣ing Compound of trifling and absurd
<HI>Improbabilities,</HI> that the <HI>tragic Influence</HI> is
<HI>overlaid</HI> and <HI>lost</HI>; nor is it possi∣ble for any
impartial and rational Spectator to take Part in the dramatic Action, or be
<HI>moved</HI> by the <HI>ill-feigned Distress.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="207" REF="210" MS="y"/>Let not the Writer be thought to
derogate from the Ability or Merit of all the <HI>Poets, Musicians,</HI> and
<HI>Singers,</HI> who devote their Labours to the <HI>Opera.</HI> He knows
there are Exceptions in each of these Departments<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Some of METASTASIO's and QUINAULT's Operas are fine Tra∣gedies in
three Acts.</NOTE>. Neither let him be supposed to censure the
<HI>Opera,</HI> as an Enter∣tainment unworthy all Attention, considered as a
mere Amusement: On the contrary, whoever is inclined to hear a Succession
of <HI>Symphonies</HI> and <HI>Songs,</HI> set off with all the Decorations
that can dazzle the Eye, and all the Refinement of Execution that can inchant
the Ear, let him attend the <HI>Opera,</HI> and he will find his Taste highly
gratified. But this Inquiry aims at a far more im∣portant Purpose: Its
Intention is, to point out the Union, the <HI>Powers</HI> and <HI>primary
Ends</HI> of <HI>Poetry</HI> and <HI>Music:</HI> And when the modern
<HI>Opera</HI> is viewed in this Light, the Writer presumes, its Defects are
too conspicuous to admit a Vindication.</P>
<P>'Tis said, indeed, that the Weakness and Impropriety of this
Entertainment is chiefly found in foreign Countries, where the <HI>Italian</HI>
Poetry and Music are not <HI>native</HI>; but that in ITALY, its Power and
Influence are considerable. This the sensible ROUSSEAU affirms in his
Dissertation on the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Italian</HI> Music. But
particular and well attested Facts are stubborn Things, and will not bend
to general Affirmations: And of this Fact, the concurrent Testimony of all
observant Travellers assures us; That in the <HI>Italian</HI> Theatre,
the Seats of the chief Hearers resem∣ble so many separate Apartments,
where the Nobility sit retired, conversing on indifferent Subjects, and
regardless of the Progress of the Drama, till some celebrated Singer 
<PB N="208" REF="211" MS="y"/> comes upon the Stage; and then, and then only,
ensues a Burst of <HI>Rapture,</HI> of <HI>Bravo's, Encores,</HI> and
<HI>Applause.</HI> The Passion, therefore, thus expressed on this
Occasion, is evidently the Effect, not of a true <HI>Feeling</HI> of the
<HI>Subject</HI> or tragic <HI>Action,</HI> which is entirely
<HI>disregarded,</HI> but (as in the later Periods of ancient ROME) of an
<HI>extravagant Admiration</HI> of the <HI>Singer's Ability</HI> and
<HI>Art.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. The modern State of the <HI>Anthem, Motet,</HI> or
<HI>Hymn,</HI> comes next under Consideration.—With Respect to the
sacred Poetry that hath ever been used in the <HI>Christian Church,</HI>
it is various in different Countries. It appears that in ITALY, it hath been an
allowed Custom from the earliest Ages, to permit the Admission of
<HI>Hymns</HI> or <HI>Motets</HI> as a Part of divine Service. This Practice,
in Course of Time, produced wild and incoherent Compositions: For the
poetic Character being separated from the musical; the
<HI>Composers,</HI> little skilled in the Art of Poetry, and yet
considering themselves as <HI>Principals,</HI> have often formed their
Motets of Sentiments and Passions <HI>inconsistent</HI> with each
other<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">For an Instance of this Kind, take the
following, which is one of CARISSIMI's most celebrated <HI>Motets:</HI> 
<Q REND="inline">"Peccavi, Domine, &amp; miserere mei; te diligit
Anima mea, te semper quaesivit Cor meum; Ergo, mi Jesu, mi Creator, mi
Salvator, dimitte Culpas, parce Peccatis meis," &amp;c.</Q></NOTE>. Another
Separation here, too, ensued: I mean the total Separation of <HI>Sense</HI>
from <HI>Sound:</HI> For these Motets are generally composed in the
<HI>Latin</HI> Tongue, and therefore <HI>unintelligible</HI> to the greatest
Part of those who <HI>hear</HI> them.</P>
<P>As to the Church Music of ITALY and its once appendant Provinces,
it hath assumed a Variety of Shapes, and in different Times hath undergone
great Changes. In the second Century, it appears that the pagan Melody was 
<PB N="209" REF="212"/> adopted, and allowed under certain Restrictions of
Modesty and Decorum<NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>JUST. MART.
<HI>Quaest</HI> 107.</BIBL></NOTE>. It was afterwards established at
CON∣STANTINOPLE by CONSTANTINE; then at ALEXAN∣DRIA, by ATHANASIUS. This
Establishment was found to have bad Effects, through the effeminate Genius
of the Music then in Vogue, and was therefore banished from the Church of
ALEXANDRIA. No Wonder, if it was infected with the Genius of the pagan Music
of the Times, which we find to have been dissolute and ener∣vate<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>See above, Sect. xi.</BIBL></NOTE>. From the general
Prevalence of this debauched Taste, AUGUSTINE was tempted to banish Music
from the Church: But AMBROSE reformed the Office of the Church of MILAN; and
established a Melody austere in the Extreme: This was improved by
GREGORY; whose Melody succeeded, and was established in the following
Century: And now, the Devastations of the Barbarians coming on, this
<HI>Plain Song</HI> naturally lay hid unchanged in the Christian Church,
during the succeeding Ages of Ignorance and Cruelty.</P>
<P>On the faint Revival of Arts in the eleventh Century, the Appearance
of GUIDO gave a new Genius to the Music of the <HI>Roman</HI> Church. For
according to the natural Tendency of his Invention of the Art of
<HI>Counterpoint,</HI> GASSENDI tells us that all the World now run mad after
an artificial Variety of Parts. About four hundred Years after GUIDO, the
debauched Art once more passed over into ITALY from GREECE: Certain
<HI>Greeks,</HI> who escaped from the taking of CONSTANTINOPLE, brought a
refined and enervate species of Music to ROME: Where, meeting with a
congenial Effeminacy, under the gay and dissolute 
<PB N="210" REF="213" MS="y"/> Pontificate of the Princes of the House of
MEDICI, it ran into such an Extreme of Indecorum, that <HI>Pope</HI> PIUS the
<HI>Fourth</HI> formed a Resolution to expel it from the Church. PALAESTRINI
had the Art and Address to divert this im∣pending Storm; by composing
some Pieces of such a majestic Gravity, as convinced the <HI>Pope</HI>
that Music thus truly sacred might be made subservient to the noblest
Pur∣poses. This Severity of Composition still remains in the <HI>Pope's
Chapel</HI>; where, ever since the Reform last men∣tioned, even musical
Instruments are not admitted, for fear of creating new Abuses. But the
common Genius of their modern Church Music or Motets is altogether
dif∣ferent: It is infected with the same Puerility of Stile with their Opera
Airs: An unbounded Compass, extrava∣gant Divisions on single Syllables, a
Play upon particular Words to the Neglect of the general Tenor of the Song,
form its general Character. How can it be otherwise? When the same
Musicians, (and these seldom much in∣terested in the Subject, or
acquainted with the Language of their sacred Poetry) generally compose both
for the <HI>Opera</HI> and the <HI>Church.</HI> Some noble Exceptions, however,
may be found to this general Remark; Of these, CARIS∣SIMI is one: But the
most eminent Instance is in BENEDETTO MARCELLO a noble <HI>Venetian</HI>;
many of whose Psalms, if we consider their Expression either as
sublime, tender, graceful, or joyous, clearly excel the vocal Compositions
of all his Countrymen, in Variety, Sim∣plicity, and Truth<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">It must be observed, that MARCELLO's Compositions are not
set to the <HI>Latin Translation</HI>; but to an <HI>Italian
Paraphrase</HI> of the Psalms.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>With Respect to the <HI>Performance</HI> of their Church Music
in ITALY, it hath naturally too much followed the Genius 
<PB N="211" REF="214" MS="y"/> of the Art itself. They have no established
Choirs of Priests: The <HI>Castrati</HI> are the chief Singers in the
Church: In ROME, these Performers go round the City in Bands, as they are
accidentally hired; and bring no great Credit to the sacred Music, either
by their Cha∣racters or personal Appearance. The Truth is, Church Music, in
ITALY, like that of the <HI>Opera,</HI> is considered more as a Matter of
Amusement than Devotion. Hence the Decorations and musical Exhibitions of
their <HI>Churches,</HI> in the Time of <HI>Carnaval,</HI> approach towards
those of the <HI>Theatre</HI> at an <HI>Opera:</HI> And the general Attention
is so far from being turned on sacred Subjects, that it is chiefly
exercised in <HI>Debates</HI> and <HI>Quarrels</HI> about the
<HI>Excellence</HI> and <HI>Superiority</HI> of the performing
<HI>Castrati.</HI></P>
<P>Such then have been the <HI>Separations</HI> and
<HI>Progressions</HI> of <HI>sacred Poetry</HI> and <HI>Music</HI> in
the <HI>Mother</HI> Country, from whence they have been chiefly derived and
transmitted to the rest of EUROPE. However, as they wear an Aspect
somewhat different in FRANCE and ENGLAND, it may be proper to point out the
chief Variations, together with the Causes that have produced them.</P>
<P>In FRANCE the sacred Poetry of their <HI>Motets</HI> or
<HI>Hymns</HI> is, in its general Turn, much superior to that of ITALY: For
in FRANCE it is most commonly selected and borrowed, if not transcribed,
from the <HI>sacred Writings.</HI> This insures to it a considerable
Degree of Propriety, Dignity, and Force. How this came to pass, we may learn
from an Authority no less than that of the great COLBERT; who, in his
political Testament, acknowledges this among other Obli∣gations which the
Church of FRANCE hath owed to their Intercourse with the
<HI>Protestants,</HI> that it hath given them a <PB N="212" REF="215" MS="y"/>
more general and intimate Acquaintance with the holy Scriptures.—Their
sacred Music, though not possessed of that Grace which the best
Italian may truly boast, yet it may be justly regarded as the best that
FRANCE hath pro∣duced; because it is set to a much better musical
Language than their own: For the <HI>Latin</HI> Tongue hath a Variety of Accent
and Measure, which adapts itself happily to musical Expression;
whereas the <HI>French</HI> Language is hoarse, ill-accented, or of ambiguous
Accent, void of Har∣mony and Variety, and incurably discordant: But still,
the Composition of their <HI>Motets</HI> in the <HI>Latin</HI> Tongue is
at∣tended with the same absurd Consequence as in ITALY, that the People
in general do not understand them.—In one Respect, however, their
sacred Music hath not de∣parted from its proper Character so far as the
modern <HI>Italian</HI>; I mean, in its Gravity of Stile: And this, it seems
probable, hath been owing in Part to take established Choirs in FRANCE,
which are composed of regular <HI>Eccle∣siastics,</HI> and therefore not
so easily seduced to adopt a light and flaunting Species of Music, as
the wandering Bands of <HI>Italian Castrati.</HI> Another concomitant Cause
of this reserved and sober Music may probably have been the Mixture of
the Protestant Party in FRANCE: For these (according to the Genius of every
new-reformed Sect) adopted a grave and simple Melody: They were therefore a
salutary Check upon the established Church, tending to the Prevention of
open and scandalous Abuses.—Lastly, with Regard to the Article of
<HI>Performance,</HI> the <HI>French</HI> have greatly the Advantage in Point
of Propriety and Decorum; for, as we have observed, their Choirs are
com∣posed of an established Priesthood, who attend to this 
<PB N="213" REF="216" MS="y"/> peculiar Profession; whose Characters are
of higher Con∣sideration than those of the <HI>Italian</HI> Bands; and
whose Learning, as well as Religion and Manners, naturally lead them to a
more reverent and devout Execution of their sacred Office.</P>
<P>In ENGLAND the State of Things is in some Respects better, and
in some Respects worse than in FRANCE. Our sacred Poetry, sung in the
<HI>Cathedrals,</HI> is transcribed strictly from the <HI>holy
Scriptures,</HI> and most commonly from the Book of Psalms: Except only the
<HI>Te Deum,</HI> which is one of the most ancient and approved Hymns of the
Church. This Restriction, by which no Hymns of new Invention are admitted as
a Part of divine Service, we owe to the grand Reformation: This opened to us
the Foun∣tain of the sacred Writings, which had before been locked up, as in
ITALY. From the same Cause, our <HI>Anthems</HI> are likewise given in
our own Tongue; which though not so various as the <HI>Latin,</HI> is yet
generally round and sonorous, clearly accented, and capable of being adapted
to a Variety of musical Expression. But while we justly ad∣mire the
<HI>sacred Poetry</HI> of our <HI>Cathedral</HI> Service, must we not
lament the State of it in our <HI>parochial</HI> Churches, where the cold, the
meagre, the disgusting <HI>Dulness</HI> of STERNHOLD and his
<HI>Companions,</HI> hath <HI>quenched</HI> all the <HI>poetic Fire</HI> and
<HI>devout Majesty</HI> of the <HI>royal Psalmist.</HI></P>
<P>The Character of our <HI>Cathedral Music</HI> is of a
<HI>middle</HI> Kind: Not of the first Rank in the great Quality of
<HI>Ex∣pression</HI>; nor yet so improper or absurd, as to deserve a
ge∣neral Reprobation. Too studious a Regard to <HI>Fugues</HI> and an
artificial <HI>Counterpoint</HI> appears in the <HI>old,</HI> and too
<HI>airy</HI> and <HI>light</HI> a Turn, to the Neglect of a grand Simpli∣city,
<PB N="214" REF="217" MS="y"/> in the <HI>new:</HI> Two Extremes which tend
equally, though from opposite Causes, to destroy <HI>musical
Expres∣sion</HI><NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>For a full View of this
Subject, see Mr. AVISON's <HI>Essay on musical
Expression.</HI></BIBL></NOTE>. Yet, there are Passages in PURCEL's
Anthems, which may fairly stand in Competition with those of any
Composer, of whatever Country. There are others who may justly claim a
considerable Share of Praise. HANDEL stands eminent, in his Greatness
and Sublimity of Style.—Our <HI>parochial Music,</HI> in general, is
solemn and devout: Much better calculated for the Performance of a whole
Congregation, than if it were more broken and elaborate. In Country Churches,
wherever a more artificial Kind hath been imprudently attempted, Confusion
and Disson∣ance are the general Consequence.</P>
<P>The <HI>Performance</HI> of our Cathedral Music is defective: We
have no grand established Choirs of Priests, as in FRANCE; whose
Dignity of Character might in a proper Degree maintain That of the divine
Service. This Duty is chiefly left to a Band of <HI>Lay-Singers,</HI> whose
Rank and Education are not of Weight to preserve their Profession from
Contempt. The Performance of our parochial Psalms, though in the Villages it
be often as mean and meagre as the Words that are sung; yet in great Towns,
where a good Organ is skilfully and devoutly employed by a sensible
Organist, the Union of this Instrument with the Voices of a
well-instructed Congregation, forms one of the grandest Scenes of
unaffected Piety that human Nature can afford. The Reverse of this appears,
when a Com∣pany of illiterate People form themselves into a <HI>Choir</HI>
distinct from the Congregation. Here Devotion is lost, 
<PB N="215" REF="218" MS="y"/> between the impotent <HI>Vanity</HI> of those
who <HI>sing,</HI> and the ignorant <HI>Wonder</HI> of those who
<HI>listen.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. The <HI>Oratorio</HI> is a <HI>dramatic
Representation</HI> of some Story taken from the sacred Scriptures, or
the Records of the Church, accompanied with Music. Its Origin is at∣tributed
to the barbarous Period of the <HI>Croisades</HI>; when Companies of
<HI>Pilgrims,</HI> returning from JERUSALEM, formed themselves into
<HI>Choirs,</HI> and sung the Praises and Atchievements of Saints and
Martyrs<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>MENETRIER <HI>des Represent. en
Musique.</HI></BIBL></NOTE>. Thus it is said to have arisen and been
established in FRANCE. But how it could assume the Form of <HI>dramatic
Representation accompanied with Music,</HI> is hard to say, without
supposing it (like the <HI>Opera)</HI> to have been the Effect of an
<HI>Imitation.</HI> On this principle we may trace it to a probable Origin. It
is well known, that the Pagan Shews were often ex∣hibited in the Temples, or at
the Tombs of deceased Heroes: 'Tis no less certain, that the early
Christians adopted the Practice, with a due Change of Objects, either from a
mere Imitation of the Pagan Custom, or with a View to the Conversion of
Idolators. Nothing, therefore, could be more natural, than that the musical
Accompanyment should remain, though the Objects were changed. Of this Mode of
Piety we have a clear Instance in a Discourse of AUGUSTINE, who condemned
the Practice; where, speaking of CYPRIAN's Tomb, he says, 
<Q REND="inline">"Not many Years ago, the Petulance of the Dancers
had invaded this sacred Place, where the Martyr's Body is laid: All Night
long prophane Songs were sung, and were accompanied with theatrical
Gesticulations<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>AUG. <HI>Serm. in nat. Divi</HI>
CYPRIANI.</BIBL></NOTE>."</Q> <PB N="214" REF="219" MS="y"/>

<GAP DESC="duplicate" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/> <PB N="216" REF="221"/> Now
supposing this Practice to have still subsisted in some remote or
obscure Part of ASIA or GREECE, it might na∣turally be adopted by Companies
of devout Pilgrims, in their Peregrinations to the holy Land: And thus the
sa∣cred musical Drama would be <HI>naturally produced.</HI></P>
<P>In ITALY the Origin of the <HI>Oratorio</HI> is said to have been
more recent, and clearly the Effect of an Imitation. We are told, that the
famous PHILIP DE NERY, a Na∣tive of FLORENCE, and Founder of the Congregation
of the Priests of the <HI>Oratory</HI> in the Year 1540, observing the
strong Passion of the <HI>Roman</HI> People for <HI>musical
Represent∣ations,</HI> invented the <HI>sacred Drama,</HI> with a View to
their Improvement in Piety. Hence it is said to have received the Name of
<HI>Oratorio,</HI> which it still wears. The <HI>Opera,</HI> already
established at VENICE and ROME, was his Model: He had little more to do,
than to change the Objects from <HI>Pagan</HI> to <HI>Christian:</HI> And
thus from ITALY it spread into other Parts of EUROPE<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>BOURDELOT <HI>Hist. de la Musique,</HI> tom. i. p.
256.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P>The capital Impropriety and Defect of this Entertain∣ment, while it
wears the <HI>dramatic</HI> Form, is the perpetual Recitative or musical
Accompanyment in the interlocutory Parts, similar to that of the
<HI>Opera.</HI> This is a Circum∣stance so repugnant to modern Manners, and
therefore so far out of Nature, that no Audience can be much affected by the
Representation, or take Part in an Action so impro∣bably feigned. The
necessary Effect of This glaring Im∣probability is a general Inattention to
the <HI>Subject,</HI> and a Regard centered chiefly on the <HI>Music</HI> and
<HI>Execution.</HI></P>
<P>Of this Species of <HI>Poem</HI> the <HI>Italians</HI> have some
fine ones, written by METASTASIO. They cannot perhaps be rank∣ed 
<PB N="217" REF="222"/> in the first Class, either for Sublimity or Pathos.
But Elegance of Style, Simplicity of Plan and Conduct, ani∣mated by a noble
Spirit of Devotion, prevails throughout these Compositions. The
<HI>Music</HI> of the <HI>Oratorio</HI> in ITALY too much resembles That of
the <HI>Opera:</HI> Simplicity, Ma∣jesty, and devout Expression, are
sacrificed to the Com∣poser's Vanity or ill-directed Art.</P>
<P>The <HI>Performance</HI> of this <HI>sacred Drama</HI> in ITALY is
said to be attended with many of the same Circumstances of Impropriety
with that of the <HI>Opera,</HI> from which it had its Origin: All tending to
render it rather a Subject of mere Amusement, than of Piety and Virtue. Add
to this, that being performed in the Churches, it may be questioned whether
the Drama be dignified, or the Temple prophaned, by so inadequate a
Representation.</P>
<P>In FRANCE, I do not find the <HI>Oratorio</HI> is now in Use: Its
first rude Form produced <HI>Comedy</HI> and <HI>Tragedy</HI> in that
Kingdom: But the Parent seems to have died at their Birth<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>BOILEAU, <HI>Art Poet.</HI></BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P>In ENGLAND, this <HI>sacred Drama</HI> is in some Respects
<HI>well,</HI> in others, <HI>ill</HI> conducted. Next to the perpetual
musical Accompanyment, the leading Impropriety hath arisen from an entire
<HI>Separation</HI> of the <HI>Poet's</HI> and <HI>Musician's Office.</HI>
Even when the <HI>Poet</HI> remains <HI>principal,</HI> this Sepa∣ration tends
to bad Effects: But to compleat the Evil, the <HI>Musician's</HI> Character
hath here, in many Instances, assumed the <HI>Precedence</HI>; and the
<HI>Poet</HI> become <HI>subservient</HI> to him, as his <HI>Director.</HI>
How this came to pass, may be easily explained. This Kind of Poem being
unknown in ENG∣LAND <PB N="218" REF="223" MS="y"/> when HANDEL arrived; and that
great Musician being the first who introduced the <HI>Oratorio</HI>; it
became a Matter of Necessity, that he should <HI>employ</HI> some
Writer in his Service. Now this being a Degradation, to which Men of Genius
would not easily submit, he was forced to apply to <HI>Versifiers</HI>
instead of <HI>Poets.</HI> Thus the Poem was the Effect either of Hire or
Favour, when it ought to have been the voluntary Emanation of Genius. Hence,
most of the Poems he composed to, are such, as would have sunk and
disgraced any other Music than his own.</P>
<P>But although his exalted Genius bore itself up against this
Weight of Dulness; yet such a leading Defect could not fail to have
essential Effects on the Musician's Art. For although no Man ever
possessed greater Powers of musical Expression; yet, when the
Writer gave him some∣times little, and sometimes nothing to express, the
main Foundation of his Art failed him: He was in the Situation of a great
Painter, who should be destined to give Life by Colours, to a dead and
unmeaning Design<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">The MESSIAH is an Exception to this
general Remark: Though that grand Musical Entertainment is called an
<HI>Oratorio,</HI> yet it is not <HI>dramatic</HI>; but properly a Collection
of <HI>Hymns</HI> or <HI>Anthems</HI> drawn from the sacred Scriptures: In
strict Propriety, therefore, it falls under another Class of Composition,
which we have already considered.—The <HI>Oratorio</HI> of SAMSON is
properly <HI>dramatic:</HI> But the Poem is so much changed in the Attempt
towards accommodating it to Music, that it can hardly be regarded as the Work
of MILTON.—The L'ALLEGRO and IL PENSEROSO are two elegant Poems; and are
finely set to Music by HANDEL: But being merely <HI>descriptive,</HI> and
in no Degree <HI>pathetic,</HI> they cannot be ranked among the highest Forms
of Poetry; nor could they give Play to his highest Powers of
Expression.</NOTE>. Nay, even where any Degree of poetical Expression
happened to give Play to his expressive Powers, yet still, the general 
<PB N="219" REF="224" MS="y"/> Composition being unconnected, weak, and
unaffecting, there could be neither Contrast nor Succession of pathetic
Songs and Choirs; which, when properly united in one great Subject, heighten
each other by a continued Pro∣gression, like the successive Scenes of
a <HI>well-plan'd Tragedy.</HI> Had HANDEL's Airs and Choirs been composed in
this connected Manner, and the Probability of the Represen∣tation in other
Respects preserved, their Effect had been proportionable. At present,
being often disjoined, and deprived of that Connexion which ought to arise
from the Poet's Art, they lose all the Force which an Accumulation of
Passion would have produced. They stand single: While in a
well-conducted Poem, the Effect of every <HI>suc∣ceeding</HI> Song or Choir
would be heightened by the Power of the <HI>preceding.</HI></P>
<P>But while we pay all due Regard to the Memory of this great
Musician, and acknowledge, nay maintain, that his Compositions often
arise to the highest Pitch of <HI>Sublimity</HI> and <HI>Pathos</HI>;
critical Justice demands some farther Remarks on this Subject, for the Sake
of future Artists.—As a neces∣sary Consequence, therefore, of the
<HI>Separation</HI> of the <HI>Poet's</HI> and <HI>Musician's</HI> Province,
and of his too great At∣tention to the <HI>latter</HI>; his Music is
sometimes improperly conducted, even where it is not influenced by the
Defects of the Poem. From this Separation, in which he only complied with the
established Practice of the Times, the following incidental Defects
naturally arose. 1. Too much musical Division upon single Syllables, to
the Neglect of the Sense and Meaning of the Song.—2. A partial
Imitation of incidental Words, instead of a proper Expression of the
ruling Sentiments; even when such Words and Sentiments happen to be con∣trary
<PB N="220" REF="225" MS="y"/> to each other.—3. Solo Songs often too much
lengthened, without the Intervention of the Choir, to in∣spirit and
sustain them: Especially the <HI>Da Capo</HI> is almost in every
Instance of bad Effect, as it renders the first and capital Part of the
Song <HI>insipid</HI> by an <HI>unmeaning Repeti∣tion.</HI>—4. Choirs
sometimes too much lengthened, without the Intervention of single Songs or
Duets, for the necessary Repose of the Ear, which is apt to be fatigued
and dis∣gusted by such a long-continued and forcible
Impression.—5. Choirs sometimes (though seldom) calculated more
for the Display of the Composer's Art, in the Construction of
<HI>Fugues</HI> and <HI>Canons,</HI> than for a natural Expression of the
Subject.—6. The <HI>Choir</HI> in <HI>many</HI> Instances (and the
<HI>single Song,</HI> in <HI>some)</HI> not <HI>sudden</HI> enough in its
Intervention; being generally <HI>prepared</HI> by a correspondent Symphony
of instrumental Music; which creates Expectation and Pre∣sentiment,
destroys Surprize, and thus <HI>lessens</HI> the <HI>Impression</HI>
and <HI>Effect.</HI></P>
<P>Instances might be produced of all these Defects, in the
Compositions of this great Master: But they arose not so much from
Himself, as from the Period in which he lived. Therefore the Writer chuseth
to cast them into Shades, refering them to the Observation and Regard of
musical Professors rather than seem to fix a Mark of Disrespect on
any particular Composition of a Man whose exalted Genius he reveres. And
upon the whole, his <HI>Airs, Duets,</HI> and <HI>Choirs,</HI> as they
surpass every thing yet produced, in Gran∣deur and Expression; so,
they will ever be the richest Fountain for <HI>Imitation</HI> or
<HI>Adoption</HI>; and, even singly taken, will justly command the Regard
and Admiration of all succeeding Ages.</P>
<P><PB N="221" REF="226" MS="y"/>The <HI>Performance</HI> of the
<HI>Oratorio</HI> in ENGLAND, under its present, defective State, in some
Respects may be cen∣sured; in others, is to be approved. The Exhibition of
the Choir and accompanying Band is not only decent, but grand and striking: A
becoming Gravity attends it, both among the Performers and the Audience. The
Airs and Choirs are often sung with a Decorum not unsuitable to the Dignity
of the Occasion. On the other Hand, there are Defects which naturally arise
from the <HI>Separation</HI> of the <HI>Performer's</HI> from the
<HI>Poet's</HI> and <HI>Musician's</HI> Art.—The Singers are not always
so animated in their Manner, as to create a Belief in the Audience (whenever
a true poetic and musical Expression are united) that they feel the
Sen∣timents they express. If a grand Simplicity of Performance were still
more studied, it would give an additional Lustre to their Talents. Above
all, the <HI>flourished Close</HI> or <HI>Ca∣dence</HI> is below the
Dignity of the <HI>sacred Drama,</HI> and absolutely destructive of all
true musical Expression.</P>
<P>Thus we have traced the <HI>Rise, Union, Power, Progres∣sions,
Separations,</HI> and <HI>Corruptions,</HI> of <HI>Poetry</HI> and
<HI>Music,</HI> together with the <HI>Causes</HI> of these several
<HI>Gradations</HI>; from their first Appearance in the <HI>savage</HI>
State down to their present Forms in the more <HI>polished Nations</HI> of

<HEAD>SECT. XIII. Of the possible Re-union of Poetry and
Music.</HEAD>
<P>IT remains now to consider the Circumstances in which, and the
means by which, 'tis possible, that the Arts of Poetry and Music may
again be powerfully and ef∣fectually united, after these Separations have
taken Place.</P>

<P><PB N="222" REF="229" MS="y"/>The <HI>Legislator's</HI> and
<HI>Bard's</HI> Character cannot again be <HI>generally</HI> and <HI>fully
united.</HI> We have seen, they na∣turally separate in an early Period of
Civilization: And the Departments become so distinct, as to create a
general Incompatibility and Repugnance too clear to need an Illustration. But
although the Legislator can∣not generally maintain the poetic and musical
Character, he may still continue to <HI>protect,</HI> and sometimes even to
<HI>possess</HI> it: And when Poetry and Music are united in their
proper Ends, there are few <HI>secondary Accomplishments</HI> which do
truer Honour even to the highest Stations. It was indeed a ridiculous Vanity
in a late <HI>Emperor</HI> to sing in an Opera; as it was in LOUIS the
Fourteenth to dance on a parallel Occasion; because, in these
Instances, the Arts were separated from their Important Ends. But it was a
noble Example in CHARLEMAGNE, when he dig∣nified his Choir, by joining them in
the public Act of Religion, and singing divine Service in his imperial Robes.
HENRY the Second, and FRANCIS the First, of FRANCE; CHARLES the Great, of
GERMANY; ALFRID the Great, of ENGLAND; were all distinguished, not only by
their <HI>Love</HI> and <HI>Protection</HI> of the musical and poetic Arts,
but by their <HI>Proficiency</HI> in them, as applied to their highest
Ends.</P>
<P>And as the Legislator may still incidentally retain a Part of
the Poet's Dignity; so the Poet, though no longer a Legislator, may still
occasionally exert his salutary Power, by his Influence on the Passions
of the Soul.—CHARLES the Ninth of FRANCE (who not only composed and
per∣formed Church Music, but writ elegant Verses) addressed a little
Poem to RONSARD, which does equal Honour to the <HI>Prince</HI> and the
<HI>Poet.</HI> And as it so nobly asserts the <PB N="223" REF="230"/>
Dignity of the musical and poetic Arts, and points at their original Alliance
with the legislative Character, the fol∣lowing Citation seems to claim a
Place under this Article.</P>
<Q> 
<L>Ton Esprit enflammé d'une celeste Ardeur,</L> 
<L>Eclatte par soy-meme, &amp; moy par ma Grandeur.—</L> 
<L>Ta Lyre qui ravit par de si doux Accords</L> 
<L>T'asservit les Esprits, dont je n'ay que le Corps:</L> 
<L>Elle t' en rend le Maitre, &amp; te sçait introduire,</L>

<L>Oú la plus fier Tyran ne peut avoir d'Empire.</L></Q>
<P>The <HI>Poet's</HI> and <HI>Musician's</HI> Office cannot probably
be again united in their full and general Power. For in their present refined
State, either of their Arts separately con∣sidered, is of such
<HI>Extent,</HI> that although they may inci∣dentally meet in one Person,
they cannot often be found together.—One Expedient there is, indeed, by
which the two Arts may be practically united by the same Person. That is,
if the <HI>Poet</HI> select and adapt proper <HI>Music</HI> to his Poem; or
the <HI>Musician</HI> select and adapt proper <HI>Poetry</HI> to his
Music. Let us then consider, which of these Methods is most likely to
succeed, in uniting the two Arts <HI>effectually.</HI> Now, though we
suppose the Musician to be of sufficient Ability to distinguish
<HI>good</HI> Poetry from <HI>bad</HI>; we must farther observe, that to
collect various Passages from vari∣ous Poets, and form them into one
<HI>whole</HI> with Propriety and Force, would be a Task difficult, if not
impossible: For the Expressions of Poetry are <HI>particular,</HI> and
un∣alterably <HI>appropriated</HI> to their Subject: They are therefore
generally incapable of a second Application. The Fact is quite otherwise in
Music: For here, the Expressions are <HI>general</HI> and <HI>vague:</HI>
it is the <HI>Poetry</HI> to which they are applied, which fixeth and gives
them their <HI>particular Ex∣pression.</HI> <PB N="224" REF="231"/>
Therefore, a Selection of various Pieces may be made, and united in one
<HI>whole,</HI> with Propriety and Effect. This Union is indeed sometimes
made in an unmeaning Way, in what the <HI>Italians</HI> call a
<HI>Pasticio:</HI> Where we commonly see a Series of Songs thrown together,
without Connexion or Design. But if we suppose a Poem properly conducted,
and adapted to Music of the first Excellence, in Subserviency to the
Genius of the Poem; 'tis plain, that the Music so applied may acquire a
Force of Expression more powerful in the <HI>second</HI> Application than
in the <HI>first.</HI> As (to resume a former Allusion) the same Kind
of <HI>Colours</HI> may acquire a stronger Effect, by being employed on a
<HI>forcible</HI> than an <HI>insipid Drawing.</HI> This is an <HI>Union</HI>
far easier to <HI>attempt,</HI> than to <HI>accomplish.</HI> However; thus
much it seemed proper to remark, lest every Endeavour of this Kind should
be regarded as a mere <HI>Pasticio.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Singer's</HI> Profession can seldom be united with
that of the <HI>Poet,</HI> and not generally with that of the
<HI>Musician.</HI> The same Cause will maintain the Separation here, as
in the poetic and musical Professions. The Arts, in their present
refined and complicated State, separately demand such continued Application
and various Qualities, as seldom meet in the same Person.—'Tis the
Performer's Province, therefore, in this State of Separation, to conform to the
Genius of the <HI>Poem</HI> and the <HI>Music.</HI> As the Musician is
subordinate to the Poet, so the Performer is subordinate to
<HI>Both.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Epic</HI> Poem cannot be again united with <HI>Music.</HI>
The Reasons may be collected from the preceding Parts of this
Dissertation. The long Narrations, the frequent Dialogue, the Mixture of
calm Description and unim∣passioned <PB N="225" REF="232"/> Sentiment, all
these are clearly incompatible with the musical Alliance, unless where
long-continued Custom, and a Pre-Establishment drawn from savage
Manners, had produced and confirmed an Union. But this, once broken, can never
be effectually restored: For it must ever want that Foundation of
<HI>Habit,</HI> on which it first arose, and gain∣ed its Power<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>See above, Sect. vi. Art. 10.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P>The <HI>Tragic</HI> Poem can never again be powerfully united with
Music. This repugnance ariseth from the same Cause with the last. For
here, the continued musical Accompanyment, mixing itself with the dramatic
Cha∣racter and the perpetual Dialogue, forms a <HI>whole</HI> so
incom∣patible with modern Manners, and so far out of known Nature, as
destroys that Probability which is the first Foundation of a true
Pathos.</P>
<P>The <HI>Ode,</HI> or <HI>hymnal</HI> Species, may be again properly
and forcibly united with <HI>Music.</HI> We have already seen the
Foundation on which this Species is more universally al∣lied with Melody than
any other<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Sect. vi. Art. 17.</BIBL></NOTE>. The
great Mean of their powerful Union must be a pathetic and correspondent
Simplicity of Composition in Both.—With Respect to the pathetic
Simplicity of the <HI>Ode</HI>; although the obscure, the learned, the cold,
the florid, the wordy, the amusing Style, hath been too generally adopted by
the Moderns; yet this false Manner is not so strongly established, as
to preclude all Possibility of a general Reform: For we find, that where
the Poem is written in the simple, intelligible, and pathetic Form, it is
more generally approved (except only by <HI>mere Scholars</HI> who are ignorant
of Nature) than <PB N="226" REF="233" MS="y"/> the opposite Manner of false
Refinement. In Proof of this, we need only alledge the two noble Odes of POPE
and DRYDEN; which the world in general understand, feel, and admire.</P>
<P>A <HI>simple</HI> and <HI>pathetic Melody</HI> may be no less
successfully adopted, and applied to Poetry. This is evident, from the
incidental and frequent Practice of the greatest Masters. HANDEL, MARCELLO,
BONONCINI, CORELLI, GEMI∣NIANI, and their best Disciples, are often
admirable in the pathetic Simplicity of Song: More especially they are so,
when they are fortunate enough to forget the Ostenta∣tion and Parade of Art.
The Success is answerable to their Desert: For this Simplicity of Style
is admired be∣yond the artificial, by <HI>All,</HI> except only a <HI>Few,</HI>
whose Taste (like that of the mere <HI>Scholar-Tribe)</HI> is debauched by
their own false Refinements<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot"> 
<P>Here it may be proper to point out, on what Foundation a
<HI>simple Melody</HI> is more <HI>pathetic</HI> than a <HI>complex</HI> and
<HI>artificial.</HI> 1. In the Expression of the Passions, Nature doth
not offer musical Sounds to the human Ear. For though the natural Tones of
<HI>Grief</HI> and <HI>Joy</HI> (the two Passions which are most
effectually expressed by Music) approach nearer to musical Precision
than any other, yet still they are in a certain Degree inconcinnous and
unmusical. 2. As the Tones of the Passions are in some Degree
unmusical, so are they generally more simple in their Composition or
Succession, than the Tones which are commonly employed to form a regular
Melody. From the first of these Remarks it follows, that all musical
Expression of the Passions must be <HI>imperfect:</HI> For the
musical Sounds not being found in Nature, if the Artist strictly imitates
the Sounds he hears, they will be un∣musical; if he varies from Nature, so
as to make them musical, the Imitation will be defective. Yet Imagination
hath a Power of im∣posing its impressions on Reason, in a certain
Degree. This we find at the proper Representation of a Tragedy; where, though
the Scenery, the Persons, the Dresses, the Composition, and other
accompanying Ob∣jects, are not a precise Transcript from Nature, that is,
though the Imi∣tation be defective, yet still it is highly affecting: But if
the Representation departs from Nature beyond a certain Degree, Reason then
revolts, and the affecting Power is lost: And thus musical Imitation,
though imperfect in a certain Degree, still boasts its Power: If imperfect
<HI>beyond</HI> a certain Degree, its affecting Power is lost. But as it
follows from the second Re∣mark, that the farther musical Sounds depart
from <HI>Simplicity,</HI> the farther they depart from <HI>Nature</HI>; so,
the Consequence is clear, that a <HI>simple Melody</HI> (though an
imperfect Imitation) may be <HI>pathetic</HI>; while a <HI>complex</HI> and
<HI>artificial</HI> Melody (by departing from Nature beyond a certain Degree)
will entirely <HI>lose</HI> its <HI>affecting Power.</HI></P> 
<P>This naturally leads to the Consideration of a mysterious
Circumstance, which lies yet unaccounted for, at the very Foundation of
musical Ex∣pression. The Fact is this; that 
<Q REND="inline">"musical Sounds which are employed to
express Passions (as Grief or Joy) by an <HI>imperfect Imitation,</HI>
are often <HI>more affecting</HI> than the <HI>natural</HI> or <HI>perfect
Voice</HI> of these Passions, when given without musical
Intonations."</Q>—It seems not easy to assign a clear and
sufficient Cause for this Appearance. Let the following Conjectures have
what Weight they may.—1. Have not musical Sounds a mechanical Power
over the human Frame, by which they awaken it into a higher Degree of
<HI>Sensibility</HI> and <HI>Sympathy,</HI> than it possesseth in its
more <HI>cool</HI> and <HI>torpid</HI> State?—2. Are we not generally
so constituted, as to sympathize much more strongly with those in
whom we find amiable Qualities, than their Opposites? And as Pity melts the
Soul to Love, so doth not Love melt the Soul to Pity?—3. Doth not a
<HI>sweet Voice,</HI> like a <HI>fine Countenance,</HI> create a strong
<HI>Prejudice</HI> in <HI>Favour</HI> of its <HI>Possessor,</HI> and
induce a <HI>Belief</HI> of <HI>amiable</HI> inherent
<HI>Qualities?</HI>—4. May not the Voice and Figure of a distressed
or joyous Object be so horrid or uncouth, ridiculous or ugly, as in a great
Measure to lessen, if not totally to destroy the Sympathy of those
who hear and see it?—If these Observations be true, then by
carrying the Voices or Expressions of Grief or Joy into sweeter Tones and
higher Degrees of Melody than they possess in Nature, yet still
preserving the Resemblance so far as not to destroy Probability, may we
not, on the Principles here given, create a higher Degree of Affection and
Sympathy, than the natural Voice of the Passions can give?</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="227" REF="234"/>Yet there is one Circumstance, in which
modern Poetry and Music, though both reduced to their full Simplicity, cannot
obtain that perfect Union which they held in an∣cient GREECE. The Numbers of
the Poem and the Mea∣sure <PB N="228" REF="235"/> of the Music will
inevitably sometimes clash. That Variety of Feet with which the Greek
Tongue abound∣ed, gave such Play to the Musician's Art, in adapting a
<HI>various</HI> and <HI>correspondent Melody,</HI> as no living Language can
boast. For Want of this Variety of Feet, there is generally a <HI>dead
Uniformity</HI> in the Structure of modern Verse. The musical Rythm or
Measure, therefore, must either want the necessary <HI>Variety,</HI> or
must <HI>sometimes</HI> be at Variance with the poetic Numbers.</P>
<P>The Arts of Poetry and Music, thus properly united and improved,
may possibly by Degrees be made a Part of <HI>Education,</HI> and applied
to the Culture of the youthful Mind, in Subjects <HI>religious, political,</HI>
and <HI>moral.</HI> This is a large Field of Observation, which at present
it may be more prudent rather to <HI>open</HI> than to <HI>tread.</HI> In
Favour of this Opinion, we may recollect the wonderful Powers of these united
Arts, exhibited above, not only in the Scenes of savage Nature, but among the
civilized Republics of ancient GREECE. And as we possess a nobler
System of Religion, Polity, and Morals, than they could ever boast; so
the Application of the Sister Arts to these, under a strict Subordination
to Truth, might seem to promise the noblest Consequences in the
Education of Youth. Yet on the other Hand, it must be owned, that under the
present State of Manners, and the established Forms of Education, this
event is rather to be wished than hoped for. Instead, therefore, of urging
a Theory which might be regarded as visionary and chimerical; the Writer will
for the present content himself with pointing out, 
<Q REND="inline">"In what Respects the four principal Kinds, in
which Poetry and Music are now united, may be either improved in their Form,
or more effectually directed to their proper Ends."</Q></P>
<P N="1"><PB N="229" REF="236" MS="y"/>1. The first of these, the
common <HI>Song</HI> or <HI>Canzonette,</HI> may perhaps be judged an Object
too inconsiderable for any serious Proposal of a Reform. But the Writer
will not be ashamed to follow the Example of the greatest Authors among the
ancient <HI>Greeks,</HI> in recommending the early Practice of a proper
domestic Music, as tending powerfully to sooth the discordant
Passions, to influence the Taste, and fix the morals of Youth. If we
reflect, now apt the youthful Ear is to catch musical Impressions, and
how open the Heart to every Impression so forcibly convey'd, it cannot be
regarded as a Matter of Indifference (among those who understand the Force
of early Habits) whether these first impressions be <HI>properly</HI>
or <HI>improperly</HI> directed. It may seem a Paradox, though perhaps a
cer∣tain Truth, that the future and leading Colour of the Passions, in both
Sexes, hath often been determined by a <HI>Song.</HI> Poets and Musicians,
therefore, would do them∣selves the truest Honour, if they would
religiously abstain from lending the attractive Colours of their
respective Arts to the Embellishment of Licentiousness and Vice.</P>
<P>The Writer would not subject himself to such an Im∣putation of
Ignorance, as to suggest the Possibility of renewing the old
<HI>Grecian</HI> Practice, when Men of the first Rank and Dignity disdained
not to grace the Feast with Songs <HI>religious, political,</HI> and
<HI>moral</HI>; with the Celebration of <HI>Gods, Heroes,</HI> and
<HI>Virtues:</HI> At the very Mention of this obsolete Practice, he sees
Ridicule pouring in from every Quarter. 'Tis enough to hope from the present
<HI>fashionable</HI> World, that they will <HI>abstain</HI> from
<HI>Songs</HI> of an <HI>opposite Nature.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="230" REF="237"/>As the practicable Utility of the common
<HI>Song</HI> or <HI>Can∣zonette</HI> seems to lie chiefly among the younger
ranks, an easy and familiar Simplicity of Style and Manner seems peculiarly
its proper Character. To this ought to be added (where the Subject will admit)
a certain Festivity and Brilliancy of Taste; that the most attractive
Colours of the Arts may be thrown on Virtue; and Benevolence, Generosity, and
Greatness of Soul, may habitually mix themselves with domestic and
social Amusement.</P>
<P N="2">2. The <HI>Anthem,</HI> with Respect to its
<HI>Subject,</HI> neither needs nor admits Improvement; being drawn from the
sa∣cred Scriptures<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Although it be a prudent Reserve
in the Church of ENGLAND, to admit no other Poetry than the <HI>sacred,</HI>
into divine Service; yet still, for the high Purpose of domestic or
private Devotion and Practice, the Com∣position of <HI>Hymns</HI> would be a
noble Addition to the Poetry and Music of a rational Society of Christians.
Here, the Poet would have Room for a Display of that Genius, which the
Prudence of the established Church hath prevented, in the wise Regulation
of her public Service. Of this Kind may be justly regarded that fine
<HI>Ode</HI> of POPE, intitled, "<HI>The dying Christian to his
Soul.</HI>"</NOTE>. A proper <HI>Selection</HI> of Words for Music is indeed
a Work of Importance here: And though in many Instances this be well made,
yet it were to be wished, that some superior Judgment would
<HI>oversee,</HI> and sometimes <HI>(negatively</HI> at least)
<HI>direct</HI> the Composer, for the Preven∣tion of <HI>Improprieties.</HI>
A parallel remark will extend it∣self almost to the whole Book of Psalms,
as they are versified by STERNHOLD, for the Use of parochial Churches.
There are few Stanzas which do not present Expressions, to excite the
Ridicule of some Part of every Congregation. This Version might well be
abolished, as it exposeth one of the noblest Parts of divine Service to
Contempt: Especially as there is another Version already 
<PB N="131" REF="238" MS="y"/> privileged, which though not excellent, is
however <HI>not in∣tolerable.</HI>—The <HI>parochial Music</HI> seems
to need no Reform: Its Simplicity and Solemnity suit well its general
Desti∣nation; and it is of Power, when properly performed, to raise
Affections of the noblest Nature. It were to be wished, that the
<HI>Cathedral Music</HI> were always composed with a proportioned Sobriety
and Reserve. Here, as we have observed, the whole is apt to degenerate too
much into an Affair of Art. A great and pathetic Simplicity of Style, kept ever
in Subserviency to the sacred Poetry, ought to be aimed at, as the
truest, and the only Praise. The same devout Simplicity of Manner may be
attained in the Performance, and ought to be studied by the Organist and
<HI>Choir:</HI> Their Ambition should lie in a natural and dignified
Execution, not in a curious Display of Art. The Maxim of AUGUSTINE was
excellent, and deserves the serious Attention both of those who perform,
and those who hear: 
<Q REND="inline">"I always think myself blameable, when I am drawn
to attend more to the <HI>Singer</HI> than to <HI>what is Sung.</HI>"</Q> But
an additional Circumstance seems necessary, as a Means of bringing back
Church Music to its original Dignity and Use: We have seen, in the
Course of this Dissertation, how the Separations follow each other in the
Decline of the poetic and musical Arts. And for the sake of Truth, we
must here observe, that in the Per∣formance of Cathedral Music, a
Separation hath long taken Place, fatal to its true Utility. The higher Ranks
of the Church do not think themselves concerned in the Per∣formance. It were
devoutly to be wished, that the musical Education were so general, as to
enable the Clergy, of whatever Rank, to join the Choir in the Celebration of 
<PB N="232" REF="239"/> their Creator, in all its appointed Forms: The Laity
would be naturally led to follow so powerful an Exam∣ple.—There is
Reason to believe, that this Separation was in Part occasioned by the
Introduction of an artificial Music, which became too difficult in the
Execution for any but professed Musicians: Here, then, we find an
ad∣ditional Motive, for bringing down the Cathedral Music from its present
complex and artificial Style, to that of Simplicity and easy Execution.</P>
<P N="3">3. With Respect to the two dramatic Forms, the
<HI>Opera</HI> and <HI>Oratorio,</HI> we have already pointed out their chief
Defects, as they exist in their present State. But as to an effectual
Reformation, such as may produce their proper <HI>Ends,</HI> it seems
utterly impracticable, while the <HI>dra∣matic Form</HI> and the <HI>musical
Accompanyment</HI> remain in <HI>Union.</HI> To hear Kings, Warriours,
Statesmen, Philo∣sophers, Patriarchs, Saints, and Martyrs, holding long
Conversations with each other in musical Recitative, is a Circumstance
so totally out of Nature, that the Imagin∣ation immediately revolts, and
rejects the Representation as absurd and incredible. The
<HI>Recitative,</HI> therefore, or perpetual musical Accompanyment which
prevails in both, being thus unalterably at Variance with the <HI>dramatic
Form,</HI> the <HI>one</HI> or the <HI>other</HI> must be
<HI>destroyed</HI> ere <HI>Proba∣bility</HI> and <HI>Pathos</HI> can
arise.</P>
<P>One Method of a Reform may be effected, by destroying the
<HI>Recitative,</HI> or perpetual <HI>musical</HI> Accompanyment: And in this
Case, the Interlocutory Part would sink into the common Form of
<HI>Tragedy.</HI> A <HI>musical Choir,</HI> distinct from the Persons of
the Drama, might still be introduced <PB N="233" REF="240"/>
<HI>occasionally,</HI> with much Propriety and Effect<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">I say, <HI>occasionally:</HI> For the <HI>continuing</HI>
Choir of the old <HI>Greek</HI> Tra∣gedy would be a Circumstance as far out
of Nature, as the Recitative it∣self. Besides, the perpetual and continuing
Choir would rob modern Tragedy of half her Powers and Graces: A strict Unity
of Place and Time, as we have seen, are its necessary Consequences<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>See above, Sect. vi. Art. 22.</BIBL></NOTE> But with
Respect to what is of far greater Importance, I mean the <HI>Action,</HI> its
Effects upon the whole were <HI>bad.</HI> 'Tis true, that even here, it had the
natural Effect of producing <HI>Unity:</HI> But while it secured the
<HI>Unity</HI> of the <HI>Action,</HI> it gene∣rally destroyed its
<HI>Force.</HI> For there are few great, distressful, or terrible Actions,
which do not require some <HI>Variety</HI> of <HI>Place,</HI> in Order to
unfold them in all their most pathetic Situations and striking Aspects:
Many of these, therefore, must be lost to the Poet and his Audience, and
a feeble and meagre Fable must generally arise from that strict Unity of
Place which the continuing Choir produced. Hence we often find the Greek
Tragedians reduced to the Necessity of conveying by Narration many
affecting Incidents, which would have formed capital Scenes, could they have
been introduced consistently with the Unity of Place. Were it necessary
to inlarge on this Subject, which is not incurious, it might be proved by an
Induction of particulars, that there is not a great and affecting Tragic Action
in the whole Compass of Antiquity, but what is miserably cramped and maimed
by this Constraint; <HI>That</HI> of the <HI>Oedipus Tyrannus</HI> only
excepted, which indeed seems nearly, if not absolutely perfect, in all the
Parts of its Construction.</NOTE>. Above all, the Occosions must have a
strong Reference to the most pathetic Situations of the tragic action: The
<HI>Choir</HI> must consist of such Characters, as may with
<HI>Probability</HI> appear in the musical Department: The Ode must be
written in the Style of Passion; not with the Parade of unaffecting
Imagery, or tedious Allegory; which, instead of rowzing an Audience, would
lull them to Repose: The Music and Performance must be of a
correspondent Nature. In pointing out this Reform of the musical Drama, the
Writer may seem to separate the two Sister <PB N="232" REF="241"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/> <PB N="233" REF="242"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/> <PB N="234" REF="243"/> Arts,
instead of uniting them: But in Reality, he only proposes their Separation
in one Circumstance, as the necessary means of compleating their Union in
another.</P>
<P>But lest this should seem to confine the musical Art to an
Alliance with the mere <HI>Ode</HI> or <HI>Hymn</HI> only, and to banish it
entirely from the Representation of <HI>Actions</HI>; let us now proceed to
another and more perfect Kind of Re∣form, in which many of the
<HI>Subjects</HI> of the <HI>Opera</HI> and <HI>Oratorio</HI> may be exhibited
in <HI>full Union</HI> with the <HI>Powers of Music,</HI> joined with
<HI>Probability</HI> and <HI>Nature.</HI></P>
<P>We have seen above, that from an Union of the <HI>Ode</HI> and
<HI>Epic,</HI> a first rude Outline of Tragedy naturally arose, compounded
of <HI>musical Narration</HI> and <HI>choral Song</HI><NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>See above, Sect. vi. Art. 19.</BIBL></NOTE>. Here then let
us fix, for the proper Form of the musical Exhi∣bition of great, terrible, or
pathetic Actions. This Union forms what may properly be styled the
<HI>Narrative</HI> or <HI>Epic Ode.</HI> It arose from Nature, at a Period
when the Actions represented were of the <HI>simplest</HI> Kind<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>See ibid.</BIBL></NOTE>. This Simpli∣city of Action is
still necessary to be preserved, for the Perfection of this Species;
because a complicated Action would inevitably produce long and unanimated
Narra∣tions, would unnerve the musical Recitation, and destroy the very
Genius of the Poem. Supposing, then, the Action to be simple and
impassioned; the <HI>Poem,</HI> the <HI>Music,</HI> and
<HI>Performance,</HI> if well conducted, will be at∣tended with such a Degree
of <HI>Nature</HI> and <HI>Probability,</HI> as will give the Alliance of
Poetry and Music their highest Power and Pathos. The intermixed Narrations
must be short and animated: The Songs and Choirs various and 
<PB N="235" REF="244"/> expressive; and being frequently interrupted by the
brief Recitals, may by these Means be inspirited far beyond the simple
and continued Ode, which from its unbroken Length often degenerates into
Languor. By this Union, all the striking Parts of the Action may be brought
forth to View, while every thing that is cold, improbable, and unaffecting, may
be veiled in Darkness.—The <HI>Recitative,</HI> or musical
Accompanyment in the <HI>narrative</HI> Parts, will <HI>here</HI> lose a
great Part of that Improbability which incumbers it in the <HI>dramatic</HI>
Representation: For <HI>here,</HI> the <HI>Reciter</HI> is a professed
Musician, whose Province lies in the Enthu∣siasm of Song; and the
<HI>Narrations</HI> being <HI>short</HI> and <HI>animated,</HI> beyond what
is possible in the continued Use of <HI>Dialogue,</HI> they approach
nearer to the Genius of the <HI>Ode,</HI> and there∣fore may without
Improbability or Impropriety receive a musical Accompanyment which approaches
nearer to a full and direct Song.—And lastly, the <HI>Songs</HI> and
<HI>Choirs</HI> are in their Performance so far from being unnatural, that
they are no more than a powerful Transcript from Nature, impelling those
who hear the Recital of the Action, and are instructed in the Laws of Melody,
to join in every represented Scene of Joy, Triumph, Terror, Exultation,
Devotion, or Distress.</P>
<P>Of this <HI>narrative or Epic Ode,</HI> we have two fine Exam∣ples
in our Language, written by POPE and DRYDEN. In Force of Passion, and
Variety of correspondent Versi∣fication<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">We have
shewn above, that the Return of the <HI>same Measure</HI> in the
<HI>Strophe, Antistrophe,</HI> and <HI>Epode,</HI> of the ancient <HI>Greek
Ode,</HI> was the natural Consequence of its Union with the <HI>Dance.</HI>
But this Union being irre∣coverably lost, the unvaried Measure of the Ode
becomes at best an un∣meaning Thing; and is indeed an absurd one, as it
deprives the Poet of that Variety of Measure, which often gives a great
Energy to the Com∣position, by the incidental and sudden Intervention of an
<HI>abrupt</HI> or <HI>lengthened</HI> Versification. The two Odes here
mentioned, contain a Variety of fine Examples in this Kind of Beauty.</NOTE>,
they are admirable. The Songs and Choirs <PB N="236" REF="245"/> are by Turns
tender, joyous, and majestic, and are often calculated for the noblest and
most powerful Union of Poetry and Music. On the other Hand, while their
un∣rivalled Excellence is admitted, critical Justice demands, that we point
out some Blemishes in these two immortal Odes, lest an
undistinguishing Principle of Imitation should lead to an Adoption of
their Faults along with their Beau∣ties.—With Respect to Mr. POPE's Ode
on St. CECILIA's Day, the <HI>Subject</HI> seems to want <HI>Unity:</HI> It
is not a Recital of <HI>one</HI> great Action, but rather a poetic
Description of the <HI>Adventures</HI> of ORPHEUS.—Mr. DRYDEN's Ode is
perfect in the Unity of the Action; but <HI>imperfect</HI> in the <HI>moral
End:</HI> For it is a Representation of the abused Power of Music, in
firing a young Prince to an Act of Revenge and Cruelty. In the Execution, there
is but one Er∣ror of Consequence; which seems to run through both these
Odes, so justly celebrated: The <HI>Narrative</HI> Part is not always
sufficiently <HI>distinguished</HI> from the <HI>Song.</HI> They run into
each other in such a Manner, that the musical Composer must often find
himself embarassed, whether to accompany with Recitative, or a more
compleat Melody. Indeed, it is manifest, that these illustrious Poets
were not aware of this Distinction: And hence it came to pass, that many
Passages which they evidently meant for <HI>Song,</HI> are in the Form of
<HI>Narration.</HI> But let this be added, as a Justice due to these
celebrated Names, that the Nar∣rations <PB N="237" REF="246"/> are in some
Parts so highly animated, that without any striking Impropriety they admit
the Accompanyment either of the Song or Choir. 'Tis obvious to remark, that
HANDEL was sometimes perplexed by this Irregularity of the poetic
Composition, when he set DRYDEN's Ode to Music: For some Parts are
thrown into Recitative which might seem rather to demand the Song; and others
are thrown into Song, which, in their present Narrative Form, seem rather
to demand the Recitative.—A Poet of inferior Rank<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Mr. HUGHES.</BIBL></NOTE> hath attempted to rectify this
Disorder in DRYDEN's <HI>Ode.</HI> But he had not sufficiently estimated
his own Strength, when he adventured to tamper with the Bow of ULYSSES.
Whenever he hath attempted a <HI>Change,</HI> he hath quenched the poetic
Fire.</P>
<P>The Subjects of the narrative or <HI>Epic Ode</HI> may be drawn with
Propriety either from <HI>ethnical</HI> or <HI>sacred Story.</HI> The
<HI>ethnical</HI> will furnish those which are <HI>moral</HI> or
<HI>political</HI>; the <HI>sacred</HI> is a rich Field of Subjects
<HI>moral</HI> and <HI>religious.</HI> There is a peculiar Propriety in
exhibiting the sacred Story in this Manner of the <HI>Epic Ode</HI>;
because in the dramatic Representation of antique Subjects, through the
great Dissimilarity of ancient Manners to our own, 'tis difficult to avoid
the Introduction of Circumstances which will not be either manifestly
<HI>incongruous,</HI> or <HI>contemptible</HI> to an <HI>Eye</HI> merely
<HI>modern</HI>; two Appearances, which are carefully to be avoided in the
Representation of sacred Story. The Way of <HI>Narration,</HI> therefore,
is highly preferable; be∣cause in this, the Poet can produce the greatest
and most striking Situations, and at the same Time preserve both
<HI>Probability</HI> and <HI>Respect,</HI> by throwing the rest into
Shades.</P>
<P><PB N="238" REF="247"/>That this Representation of sacred
Subjects is the highest and most interesting Union of Poetry and Music,
needs no elaborate Proof: It stands intimately connected with all the
sublime Truths, the great and affecting Events of our Religion, which, when
thus exhibited by the united Powers of <HI>Poem</HI> and <HI>Song,</HI> call
forth all the noblest Emotions of the human Soul; and exalt it to the
highest Pitch of Elevation that our mortal Condition will admit.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="14" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. XIV. CONCLUSION.</HEAD>
<P>THUS far then, at least, the poetic and musical Arts may admit
an effectual Re-union, so as to produce their noblest Ends. As to any
farther Consequences, they must be the Effect of this first Reform: And
therefore, till something be done here, it can be of no Importance to point
out higher Improvements, which in the present State of Things would certainly
be esteemed chimerical.</P>
<P>Let us then, for the present, conclude with offering a Question,

<Q REND="inline">"Whether our Age and Nation might not still
farther distinguish itself in its Regard for the nobler Arts, by the
Institution of <HI>A Poetic and Musical Academy,</HI> for the more
effectual <HI>Re-union</HI> of these two Arts, and their better
<HI>Direction</HI> to their <HI>highest Ends?</HI>"</Q>—The Judgment of
an able and disinterested Society, established for this Purpose,
might perhaps effect every Reform here proposed in the four distinct
Species in which the two Arts are still imperfectly and improperly united.
The Prize must be Honour only; lest mercenary Spirits <PB N="239" REF="248"/> should intrude upon the Walk of Genius. It may be sup∣posed,
that the best Poets, of the rising Age at least, would court the
Approbation of such an Academy: And from this Institution, as from a
Nursery of these Sister-Arts, a Succession of approved Poems would
naturally arise, in every Form that could properly receive the Colourings and
Embellishments of Music.—The familiar <HI>Song,</HI> com∣posed for
domestic and social Entertainment, when thus chastised by the moral
Decrees of the Academy, would gradually rise into its ancient Dignity and
Use.—The Selection of the <HI>Anthem</HI> from the sacred Scriptures
might receive the public Approbation of the Society: And the <HI>Hymn,</HI>
controuled by the same sober Judgments, would as∣sume that pathetic
Sublimity and Simplicity of Style, which tends to elevate the Soul to the
Contemplation and Love of divine Things.—The <HI>tragic Choir,</HI>
properly restrained and limited by such an Authority, might
<HI>oc∣casionally</HI> be introduced and applied to the Increase of Pity
and Terror, and to all the moral Ends of the dramatic Species. The <HI>Epic
Ode,</HI> directed by the Taste and Wis∣dom of this Academy, would obtain
its Completion. The greatest and most affecting Subjects, drawn from the
History of our own or other Countries, would rise before us; while the
sublimest and most interesting Events re∣corded in the sacred
Scriptures, thus recommended and adorned, would make their Way through the
nobler Pas∣sions to the Heart.</P>
<P>The State and Character of our <HI>Music</HI> would be no less
influenced by the Authority of such an Institution. The Poems which
should receive its unbiassed Approbation, would naturally become Objects
of the Ambition of our <PB N="240" REF="249" MS="y"/> best
<HI>Composers:</HI> Whose Genius, thus chastised and di∣rected to its
proper Ends, would no longer wander into the illegitimate Fantasies of Song;
but in just Subor∣dination to the poetic Expressions, would only be
am∣bitious of joining its Powers, for the Production of a true
<HI>Pathos.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Performance</HI> of these approved <HI>Poems</HI> thus
heighten∣ed by approved <HI>Music,</HI> would naturally correspond with the
Genius of Both, if under the Controul of the same wise Judgments. The
<HI>Singers</HI> would no longer think themselves at Liberty to desert
their Subject for the Pride of Execution: But, under the Inspection of a
superior Taste and Authority, would be led to adopt a true Sim∣plicity of
Manner; and, like the just <HI>Actor,</HI> would be only ambitious of
assisting the Poet and Musician, in adorn∣ing and compleating the
intended Representation.</P>
<P>The <HI>Importance</HI> of such an Institution may deserve our
most serious thoughts. We have seen above, how con∣genial the
<HI>poetic</HI> and <HI>musical</HI> Arts are with the Frame and Faculties of
Man: That in every Period of Manners, whether savage, barbarous, civilized,
refined, or cor∣rupted, their Influence hath been felt in every Nation of the
Earth. So universal and powerful are their Effects on the Passions of the
Soul, that perhaps no Period of human Nature can be assigned (at least,
the Writer knows of none) in which they have not been either
<HI>salu∣tary</HI> or <HI>pernicious:</HI> In which they have not either
tended to promote and confirm Religion, Virtue, and public Hap∣piness; or
been the Instruments of Licentiousness, and public Ruin.</P>
<P><PB N="241" REF="250" MS="y"/>Add to this, that whoever will look
back into the pre∣ceding Pages, will find that in all <HI>polished
States</HI> these Arts have a natural Tendency towards Corruption, unless
checked and chastised by wholesome Institutions. This Tendency
ariseth not from the Nature of the Arts them∣selves; but from that
<HI>Period of Manners,</HI> which tends to pervert them from their <HI>proper
Ends.</HI>—Would you quench this natural Flame implanted in the human
Breast? The Attempt were Folly. You must destroy our <HI>Eyes</HI> and
<HI>Ears,</HI> those Inlets to the Powers of <HI>Poetry</HI> and
<HI>Music,</HI> before you can accomplish such a Purpose. What then is
to be done, but to regulate this mighty Stream, which will inevitably run
either in the Channel of <HI>Vice</HI> or <HI>Virtue?</HI></P>
<P>More particularly, in a great and powerful Kingdom, where additional
Degrees of Wealth should flow in with every Tide; these, especially in a
Time of Peace, must in∣evitably be followed by new Degrees of inventive
Luxury, and an unwearied Passion for Dissipation and Amusement. Hence
the peculiar Danger would arise, even where no ill Intentions should dwell,
of a Perversion of the <HI>mimetic,</HI> and especially, of the
<HI>poetic</HI> and <HI>musical Arts,</HI> from their proper and exalted, to
their improper and ignoble Ends.—If in such a Kingdom, their lowest
Forms should be sought for, while their higher were neglected; if Tragedy
should give Way to Comedy, and Comedy to Farce, and Farce to Pantomime; if
Privileges should be denied to the <HI>Labours</HI> of <HI>Genius,</HI> which
were indulged to the Tricks of <HI>Harlequin</HI> and
<HI>Pierot</HI>;—what could be more justly feared, than a general
Decline of Taste, which by silent and un∣perceived Degrees might
insensibly slide into the same <PB N="242" REF="251" MS="y"/> fatal
Effects, which marked the later Periods of the <HI>Greek</HI> Republics, and
the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire?</P>
<P>On the contrary; an effectual Union of these two power∣ful Arts,
directed to their proper Ends, would be pro∣ductive of the noblest
Consequences: It would renew and augment the Dignity of every elegant
Accomplishment; would refine the Taste, inforce the Religion, purify the
Morals, strengthen the Policy, of the most prosperous Kingdom; in a Word,
would give a proper and salutary Direction to that Overflow of Wealth, which
must either <HI>adorn</HI> or <HI>overwhelm</HI> it.</P>
<P>An <HI>Institution,</HI> therefore, which may promote such
<HI>im∣portant Ends,</HI> may seem not only to claim the Atten∣tion of the
<HI>Wise</HI> and <HI>Good</HI> in every private Station; but might perhaps
be regarded as not unworthy the <HI>Protection</HI> of the <HI>best</HI> and
<HI>greatest</HI> KING.</P>

those which are re∣corded of the <HI>Irish.</HI> 3<SUP>dly</SUP>, That public
