<P>THESE home-travels are the first part of an account of my own country; and were actually performed in the year mentioned in the title page. The world justly loves the reality; therefore, this is mentioned to satisfy the public, that they are not formed out of tours undertaken at different periods.</P>
<P>THESE make of themselves a complete tour of the tamer parts of our country. In a future volume, the wild and romantic scenery will be presented, inter∣mixed with the rich vallies so frequently interspersed. To this will be added an Appendix, containing the sub∣jects referred to in this volume, with variety of other mat∣ter. I implore the aid of my countrymen to assist me in the attempt; and to favor me with the necessary mate∣rials. They will see, that great part of <HI>Denbighshire,</HI> and all parts of the four remaining counties of our principality, are still to be described. My frequent
<PB N="ii" REF="3"/>
journies through them, render me a tolerable master of their topography. I look up to my friends for history and anecdote latent among their papers; or references to our writers, least any facts lodged in books might escape my memory.</P>
<P>AMONG the gentlemen I am chiefly indebted to for information respecting the present work, I cannot pass unthanked:</P>

<HEAD>THE TOUR IN NORTH WALES, MDCCLXXIII.</HEAD>
<P>I NOW speak of my native country, celebrated in our ear∣liest history for its valour and tenacity of its liberty; for the stand it made against the <HI>Romans;</HI> for its slaughter of the legions<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vita Agricolae.</NOTE>; and for the subjection of the nation by <HI>Agricola,</HI> who did not dare to attempt his <HI>Caledonian</HI> expedition, and leave behind him unconquered so tremendous an enemy.</P>
<P>WHEN our first invaders landed in <HI>Great Britain, North Wales</HI> was possessed by the <HI>Ordovices,</HI> a name derived from the language of the country, signifying the situation; being almost entirely bounded by the river <HI>Deva,</HI> or the modern <HI>Dee,</HI> and another river of the name of <HI>Dyvi</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>Llwyd</HI> in <HI>Cambden</HI> II. 778.</NOTE>. The one flows into the <HI>Irish</HI> sea below <HI>Chester,</HI> the other into the same sea on the borders of <HI>Cardi∣ganshire.</HI></P>
<P>THE spirit which the people shewed at the beginning, did not desert them to the last. Notwithstanding they were obliged
<PB N="2" REF="10"/>
to submit to the resistless power of the <HI>Romans,</HI> they never fell a prey to the enervating charms of luxury, as the other nations of this island did. They never, with womanish invocations, requested the aid of the deserting conquerors, or sunk beneath the pressure of the new invaders; they preserved an undaunted courage amidst their native rocks, and received among them the gallant fugitives, happy in congenial souls. The hardy <HI>Saxons,</HI> for above three centuries, could not make an impression even on our low lands. <HI>Offa</HI> was the first; who extended his kingdom for some miles within our borders. His conquest was but temporary; for we possessed <HI>Chester,</HI> the capital of the <HI>Cornavii,</HI> till the year 883, when it was wrested from us by the united force of the Heptarchy beneath the able <HI>Egbert.</HI> This indeed reduced our confines; but did not subdue our spirit. With obdurate valour we suftained our independency for another four centuries, against the power of a kingdom more than twelve times larger than itself: and at length had the glory of falling, when a divided country, beneath the arms of the most wise, and most warlike of the <HI>English</HI> mo∣narchs.</P>
<P>I NATURALLY begin my journey from the place of my nativity,<NOTE PLACE="marg">FLINTSHIRE.</NOTE> <HI>Downing</HI> in the county of <HI>Flint.</HI> To give a general idea of this shire, the reader must learn, that it is lest of the twelve <HI>Welch.</HI> Its northern side is washed by the estuary of the <HI>Dee,</HI> the <HI>Seteia Estuarium</HI> of <HI>Ptolemy.</HI> The land rises suddenly from the shore in fine inequalities, clayey, and plenteous in corn and grass, for two, three or four miles, to a montanous tract that runs parallel to it for a confiderable way.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="11"/>THE lower part is divided by picturesque dingles, which run from the mountains, and open to the sea, filled with oaks. The inferior parts abound with coal and freestone; the upper with minerals of lead and calamine, and immense strata of lime∣stone and chert. The principal trade of the country is mining and smelting.</P>
<P>The northern part of the county is flat, and very rich in corn, especially wheat, which is generally exported to <HI>Liverpool.</HI> The shire, in most places, raises more than is sufficient for the use of the inhabitants. It is extremely populous; and in the mine∣ral parts composed of a mixed people, whose fathers and grand∣fathers had resorted here for sake of employ out of the <HI>English</HI> mine counties; many of whose children, born of <HI>Welsh</HI> mothers, have quite lost the language of their fathers.</P>
<P>A LOFTY range of mountains rise on the west, and form a bold frontier. Our county is watered by several small rivers; such as the <HI>Allen,</HI> the <HI>Terrig,</HI> and the <HI>Wheeler;</HI> part of its western boundary by the <HI>Clwyd;</HI> and <HI>Maelwr,</HI> a disjoined part of the country, by the DEE.</P>
<P>WE are ignorant of the classical name of this little province. The <HI>Ordovices,</HI> of which all west of <HI>Cheshire</HI> was part, were subdivided in the time of the <HI>Romans,</HI> in all probability, as the rest of the country was. They had <HI>Reguli</HI> or Lords who ruled over little districts, and united under a common leader when the exigencies of the time required. These factions weakened the state, separated their interest, and facilitated their conquest by the first invaders.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="12"/>THE names of these districts are now unknown. <HI>Gwynedd</HI> is the most antient we are acquainted with for the country of <HI>North Wales.</HI> The portion I inhabit was called <HI>Tegangle,</HI> which com∣prehends the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hree modern hundreds of <HI>Coleshill, Prestatyn,</HI> and <HI>Rudland.</HI> The name is preserved in the montanous parts of this parish, and some others, to this day called <HI>Mynnydd Tegang.</HI> I reject the translation of <HI>Tegangle</HI> into <HI>Fair England,</HI> as a mongrel compound. The word is of a much more antient date; it be∣ing derived from <HI>Cangi</HI> or <HI>Ceangi,</HI> a set of people, according to the learned <HI>Baxter,</HI> belonging to every <HI>British</HI> nation; who at∣tended the herds and resided with them in different grazing grounds at different times of the year. The neighboring <HI>Cornavii</HI> had their <HI>Ceangi,</HI> who wintered in <HI>Wiral,</HI> and took their summer residence in <HI>Tegangle;</HI> a word to be properly derived on that account from <HI>Teg,</HI> fair, <HI>Cang,</HI> the name of the people, and <HI>Lle,</HI> a place. To corroborate which, at this very day is a plain in the parish of <HI>Caerwys,</HI> a part of the old <HI>Tegangle,</HI> adjoining to this mountain, that still retains the title of <HI>Maes can havod,</HI> or the plain of the hundred summer residences. For this reason I presume to differ from Mr. <HI>Baxter,</HI> in his notion of the sum∣mer residence of these <HI>Cangi.</HI> He places it near the <HI>Canganorum Promontorium,</HI> or <HI>Braich y pwll</HI> head in <HI>Caernarvonshire;</HI> but those were the <HI>Cangi</HI> of the <HI>Ordovices,</HI> these of the <HI>Cornavii.</HI></P>
<P>IT may be remarked, that, contrary to what happens to most subdued nations, our country preserved its own language: and the conquerors even deigned to adopt the names of the <HI>British</HI> towns and people, latinizing them from the original words. Thus <HI>Londinium</HI> from LUNDEIN, <HI>i. e.</HI> LLONG DIN or
<PB N="5" REF="13"/>
DINAS, <HI>the city of ships</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cambden I. 370.</NOTE>, from its considerable commerce; DEVA from its situation on the river <HI>Deva</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Or</HI> Dysi.</NOTE>; DUNMONII from <HI>Dun∣mnyn,</HI> or <HI>the hill of ore;</HI> BRIGANTES from <HI>Brig,</HI> choice or chief men; <HI>Coritani,</HI> or rather <HI>Coitani,</HI> from <HI>Coed,</HI> a wood<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Mr. Pegge.</NOTE>. On the retreat of their <HI>Roman</HI> masters, the latinized names were dropt, except in a very few instances, and their own resumed; but the rest of the <HI>Britons,</HI> who submitted to the <HI>Saxon</HI> yoke, uni∣versally received with it the names of places from their con∣querors.</P>
<P>THE whole of <HI>Flintshire</HI> was subdued by the <HI>Saxons</HI> immediately after the taking of <HI>Chester</HI> by <HI>Egbert.</HI> It was an open country, destitute of inaccessible rocks and mountains, like the rest of <HI>North Wales;</HI> and consequently incapable of defence against so potent an enemy. The conquerors, as usual, new-named the towns, villages, and hamlets; but could not cancel the antient. Thus <HI>Hawarden</HI> still is known to the <HI>Welsh</HI> by the name of <HI>Pen∣nardd Lâg,</HI> or <HI>Halawg; Mold</HI> by that of <HI>Wyddgryg;</HI> and <HI>Hope</HI> by that of <HI>Estyn;</HI> which (with the continuance of our language to this day) proves that even at that time it mixed but little with our conquerors. Numbers of <HI>Saxons</HI> were settled among us, who held their lands from the <HI>Mercian</HI> governors or earls: we find in the Doomsday book many of their names who had possessions in this tract; such as <HI>Ulbert, Osmer,</HI> and <HI>Elmer.</HI></P>
<P>THE first notice of any sub-division of the tract called <HI>Flint∣shire,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">DOOMSDAY BOOK.</NOTE> appears in the <HI>Doomsday</HI> book. When that survey was taken, it was made a part of <HI>Cheshire,</HI> to which it was considered as
<PB N="6" REF="14"/>
an appendage, by conquest. Old records affirm, that <HI>the county of</HI> FLINT <HI>appertaineth to the dignity of the sword of</HI> CHESTER. It was soon subdued by <HI>Robert de Rothelent,</HI> commander in chief under <HI>Hugh Lupus,</HI> who carried his arms far into <HI>Wales;</HI> and secured his conquests in the marches by building, or rather by adding new works to the castle of <HI>Rudland,</HI> which he had wrested from one of our princes.</P>
<P>THE tract from <HI>Chester</HI> to the <HI>Clwyd</HI> was then considered as a hundred of <HI>Cheshire,</HI> and called in the Doomsday Book <HI>Atiscros</HI> hundred. Numbers of places still existing are mentioned in it, disguised often by the <HI>Norman</HI> spelling. <HI>Whiteford,</HI> the place in question, is called <HI>Widford:</HI> notice is also taken of some of the present townships, such as <HI>Tre-mostyn, Tre-bychton,</HI> and <HI>Merton,</HI> under the names of <HI>Mostone, Widsord, Putecaine,</HI> and <HI>Meretone.</HI> MOSTONE was then a <HI>plough-land, terra unius Carucae.</HI> It had on it four villeyns and eight boors; (<HI>Bordarii</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Borda signifies a cottage, with a small piece of land annexed, held by the service of finding for the lord, poultry, eggs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> for his <HI>bwrdd,</HI> or table.</NOTE>,) a wood a league long, and forty perches, <HI>particatae,</HI> broad, and was valued at twenty shillings.</P>
<P>WIDFORD is joined with <HI>Putecaine:</HI> The first seems to have com∣prehended our present <HI>Trelan,</HI> or the place where the church-village now stands. These had one plough-land, two villeyns, and twelve others between men and maid servants, fisheries, and a wood half a league long and forty perches broad; the value was the same with that of <HI>Mostone.</HI></P>
<P>WITH <HI>Meretone</HI> is joined the third part of <HI>Widford;</HI> and the <HI>Berewicha</HI> or hamlet of <HI>Caldecote,</HI> the last at present a township
<PB N="7" REF="15"/>
of the parish of <HI>Holywell.</HI> In this division was a presbyter, a church, and six villeyns. Here was a wood half a league long and twenty perches broad. One <HI>Odin</HI> held these of the earl.</P>
<P>AT the time of the conquest, all this tract of <HI>Flintshire,</HI> which was called by the <HI>Saxons Englefield,</HI> and afterwards by the <HI>Nor∣mans Atiscros,</HI> was in possession of <HI>Edwin,</HI> the last Earl of <HI>Mercia;</HI> and on his defeat and forfeiture, bestowed, with the earldom of <HI>Chester,</HI> on <HI>Hugh Lupus.</HI> The whole was in a manner depopu∣lated and reduced to a waste, I imagine by the two inroads made into those parts by <HI>Harold,</HI> at the command of <HI>Edward</HI> the confessor, to revenge on <HI>Griffith ap Lhewelyn</HI> the insult offered him, by giving protection to <HI>Algar,</HI> one of his rebellious sub∣jects<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Powell,</HI> 100.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>It is observable, that there were only seven churches at that time in the whole hundred: 1. <HI>Haordine,</HI> the present <HI>Hawardin;</HI> 2. <HI>Widford;</HI> 3. <HI>Bissard, Boteuuaral,</HI> and <HI>Ruagor;</HI> 4. <HI>Inglecroft, Brunfor,</HI> and <HI>Alchene;</HI> 5. <HI>Danfrond, Calston,</HI> and <HI>Wesbie;</HI> 6. <HI>Pres∣tetone</HI> and <HI>Ruestoch;</HI> and finally, the 7th at <HI>Roelend;</HI> besides one that lay waste at <HI>Cancarnacan</HI> and <HI>Whenescol.</HI> Parochial divisions had not yet taken place. Mr. <HI>Agard</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Antiquary Discourses, I. 194.</NOTE>, a writer in the latter end of the sixteenth century, remarks, that the old historians make no mention of either parishes, parsons, vicars, incumbents, or curates. The people attended, in those days, either the cathe∣dral churches, or the conventual; which were served by the prelates or monks, and those often assisted by presbyters, clerks,
<PB N="8" REF="16"/>
and deacons. As piety gained strength, other churches, for the conveniency of the devout, were erected by the no∣bility and men of property, who were desirous of spiri∣tual assistance within their precincts; and to this were owing the churches, which, at the period in question, were so spar∣ingly scattered over the land. The places which enjoy∣ed this advantage had the title of <HI>Lhan</HI> prefixed; as that of <HI>Tre,</HI> which signifies primitively a habitation, is to the town∣ships.</P>
<P>THUS in our parish is <HI>Tre-mostyn,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">TRE-MOSTYN.</NOTE> remarkable for the antient seat of the family of the same name, which acquired it by the marriage of <HI>Jevan Vychan</HI> with <HI>Angharad,</HI> heiress of <HI>Howel ap Ithel Vychan</HI> of <HI>Mostyn,</HI> in the reign of <HI>Richard</HI> II. The great gloomy hall is of very old date, furnished with the high <HI>Dais,</HI> or elevated upper end, and its long table for the lord and his jovial companions; and another in the side, the seat of the inferior partakers of the good cheer. The walls are furnished, in a suit∣able manner, with antient militia guns, swords, and pikes; with helmets and breast plates; with funereal atchievements; and with variety of spoils of the chace. A falcon is nailed against the upper end of the room, with two bells hung to each foot. With these incumbrances it flew from its owner, a gentleman in the county of <HI>Angus,</HI> on the morning of the twenty-fourth of <HI>September</HI> 1772, and was killed near this house on the morning of the twenty-sixth. The precise time it reached our country is not known; therefore we are uncertain whether this bird exceeded in swiftness the hawk which flew thirty miles in an hour in pursuit of a woodcock; or that which made a flight out of <HI>Westphalia</HI>
<PB N="9" REF="17"/>
into <HI>Prussia</HI> in a day: instances recorded<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Miscellany Tracts, Tr. V. p. 38.</NOTE> by the learned Sir <HI>Thomas Brown.</HI> The adjacent kitchen is overlooked by a gallery leading to the antient apartments of the lady of the house, at a period when the odours of the pot and spit were thought no ill savours. At one end of the gallery is a great room, remarkable for a singular event. During the time that <HI>Henry</HI> earl of <HI>Richmond</HI> was secretly laying the foundation of the overthrow of the house of <HI>York,</HI> he passed concealed from place to place, in order to form an interest among the <HI>Welsh,</HI> who favored his cause on account of their re∣spect to his granfather, <HI>Owen Tudor,</HI> their countryman. While he was at <HI>Mostyn,</HI> a party attached to <HI>Richard</HI> III. arrived there to apprehend him. He was then about to dine; but had just time to leap out of a back window, and make his escape through a hole, which to this day is called the <HI>King</HI>'s. <HI>Richard ap Howel,</HI> then lord of <HI>Mostyn,</HI> joined <HI>Henry</HI> at the battle of <HI>Bosworth,</HI> and after the victory received from the King, in token of gratitude for his preservation, the belt and sword he wore on the day: he also pressed <HI>Richard</HI> greatly to follow him to court; but he nobly answered, like the <HI>Shunamitish</HI> widow, <HI>I dwell among mine own people.</HI> The sword and belt were preserved in the house till within these few years. It is observable, that none of our historians account for a certain period of <HI>Henry</HI>'s life, previous to his accession. It is very evident, that he passed the times, when he disappeared from <HI>Bretagny,</HI> in <HI>Wales.</HI> Many cotemporary bards, by feigned names, record this part of his life, under those of the LION, the EAGLE, and the like, which were to restore the

empire to the <HI>Britons:</HI> for the inspired favorers of the house of <HI>Lancaster</HI> did not dare to deliver their verses in other than terms allegorical, for fear of the reigning prince.</P>
<P>THERE is little more remarkable about the house than what is common to others built at different times. Here are two re∣markable portraits; one of Sir <HI>Roger Mostyn,</HI> knight, with a white beard and locks, in black, with great breeches stuck round the waist-band with points. This piece of magnificence gave rise to a very coarse proverb, applied to inferior people ambitious of acting beyond their station. The other portrait is of his Lady, <HI>Mary,</HI> eldest daughter of Sir <HI>John Wynne</HI> of <HI>Gwedir,</HI> baronet. Both are full lengths, dated 1634, and I think painted by <HI>Mytens.</HI></P>
<P>HERE is another picture, not less remarkable for its ridiculous composition, than for the distinguished person painted in it. A kit-cat length of Sir <HI>Roger Mostyn,</HI> the first baronet; in a strange long flaxen wig, a breast-plate, buff skirts, and antique <HI>Roman</HI> sleeves; a black holding his helmet; his lady reading, with one hand on a scull; and by her husband a lap-dog. This gentle∣man was the most eminent loyalist of our county: raised a regi∣ment in support of the crown, consisting of fifteen hundred men, in twelve hours time<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Whitelock, 78.</NOTE>, mostly colliers; and garrisoned his house, which, in <HI>September</HI> 1643, was surrendered to the parlemen∣tary forces, with four pieces of cannon and some arms<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>.</P>

Here are besides a few small monumental marbles, with inscrip∣tions, which the antiquarian reader may find in the Ap∣pendix.</P>
<P>IN the Library is a most elegant collection of the classics,<NOTE PLACE="marg">LIBRARY.</NOTE> con∣taining variety of the most antient and rare editions; a nume∣rous collection of books relating to the <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Roman</HI> anti∣quities, especially those which comprehend the medallic history; variety of manuscripts, mostly on vellum, and many of them richly illuminated. In a few words, scarce any private library can boast of so valuable an assemblage; which remain indis∣putable evidences of the taste and judgment of that excellent man, its accomplished founder, the late Sir THOMAS MOSTYN. The family are besides possessed of other very valuable anti∣quities; such as the cake of copper found at <HI>Caer-hén</HI> in <HI>Caernarvonshire;</HI> the <HI>Torques</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This very curious antiquity is engraven in the Appendix, with the account drawn up by my learned countryman <HI>Llwyd</HI></NOTE>, discovered near <HI>Harlech;</HI> and the silver harp which the family had the power of bestowing on the most skilful minstrel, rythmer, or bard, at the <HI>Eisteddfad,</HI> or assem∣bly
<PB N="12" REF="20"/>
held for trials of their several merits. Each of these shall be spoken of in their proper places.</P>
<P>BEFORE I quit the house, I must take notice, that <HI>Thomas ap Richard ap Howel ap Jevan Vychan,</HI> Lord of <HI>Mostyn,</HI> and his brother <HI>Piers,</HI> founder of the family of <HI>Trelacre,</HI> were the first that abridged their name; and that on the following occasion. <HI>Rowland Lee,</HI> bishop of <HI>Lichfield,</HI> and president of the marches of <HI>Wales,</HI> in the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. sat at one of the courts on a <HI>Welsh</HI> cause, and, wearied with the quantity of <HI>aps</HI> in the jury, directed that the panel should assume their last name, or that of their residence; and that <HI>Thomas ap Richard ap Howel ap Jevan Vychan,</HI> should for the future be reduced to the poor dissyllable <HI>Mostyn;</HI> no doubt to the great mortification of many an antient line.</P>
<P>IN the higher part of this township stands the curious cross called MAEN ACHWYNFAN,<NOTE PLACE="marg">MAEN ACHWYN∣FAN.</NOTE> or <HI>the stone of lamentation;</HI> because penances were often finished before such sacred pillars, and concluded with weeping and the usual marks of contrition: for an example, near <HI>Stafford</HI> stood one called the <HI>weeping cross,</HI> a name analogous to ours. This is of an elegant form and sculpture: is twelve feet high, two feet four inches broad at the bottom, and ten inches thick. The base is let into another stone. The top is round, and includes, in raised work, the form of a <HI>Greek</HI> cross: beneath, about the middle, is another in the form of St. <HI>Andrew</HI>'s: and under that, a naked figure, with a spear in its hand. Close to that, on the side of the column, is represented some animal. The rest is covered with very beautiful fret-work, like what may be seen on other pillars of ancient date in several parts of <HI>Great Britain.</HI></P>

I do not presume (after the annotator on <HI>Cambden</HI> has given up the point) to attempt a guess at the age. Only must observe, that it must have been previous to the reign of gross supersti∣tion among the <HI>Welsh,</HI> otherwise the sculptor would have employ∣ed his chizzel in striking out legendary stories, instead of the elegant knots and interlaced work that cover the stone.</P>
<P>THOSE, who suppose it to have been erected in memory of the dead slain in battle on the spot, draw their argument from the number of adjacent <HI>tumuli,</HI> containing human bones, and sculls often marked with mortal wounds; but these earthy sepulchres are of more antient times than the elegant sculpture of this pillar will admit. This likewise (from the crosses) is evidently a Christian monument. The former were only in use in Pagan days.</P>
<P>THERE are likewise,<NOTE PLACE="marg">GILLI.</NOTE> near to it, an antient chapel, now a farm∣house, called <HI>Gelli,</HI> the name of an adjacent tract. This might have relation to the cross: as well as a place for performance of divine service to the abbot of <HI>Basingwerk,</HI> who had a house at no great distance, in one of our townships still called <HI>Tré-r-abbot,</HI> or the abbot's habitation. This tract (mis-spelt by the <HI>English, Getely</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Ayloff</HI>'s, Rotuli Walliae, 64, 72, 95.</NOTE>,) with the wood (at that time on it) was granted by <HI>Edward</HI> I. to the abbot and convent, on the tenth of <HI>No∣vember,</HI> at <HI>Westminster,</HI> before the death of our last prince. He also gave him power to grub up the wood, which, by the pre∣sent nakedness of the place, appears to have been done ef∣fectually.</P>
<P>FROM the summit of <HI>Garreg,</HI> a hill in this parish, the traveller may have an august foresight of the lofty tract of <HI>Snowdon,</HI> from
<PB N="14" REF="23"/>
the crooked <HI>Moel Shabog</HI> at one end, to the towering <HI>Pen∣maen-mawr</HI> at the other: of the vast promontory of <HI>Llandidno,</HI> and part of the isle of <HI>Anglesea,</HI> with the great bay of <HI>Llandulas,</HI> forming a vast crescent; the estuaries of the <HI>Dee</HI> and the <HI>Mersey:</HI> and to the north (at times) the isle of <HI>Man</HI> and the <HI>Cumberland Alps,</HI> the sure presages of bad weather.</P>
<P>I WILL descend now to <HI>Tre-Bychton,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">TRE-BYCHTON.</NOTE> another of our maritime townships, where stands my paternal house, attended (with what was very frequent in our principality) a summer-house, at a very small distance, and a cellar beneath; used as a retreat for the jolly owners and their friends, to enjoy, remote from the fair, their toasts and noisy merriment. This, and the other lower parts of the parish, are finely wooded with oaks; which grow so spontaneously, that, was the place depopulated, it would in a very few years relapse into an impenetrable forest.</P>
<P>IN <HI>Tre-lan</HI> is the parish-church, dedicated to Saint <HI>Mary.</HI> The rectory is a sinecure, which, with the vicarage, is in the gift of the Bishop of St. <HI>Asaph.</HI> The church, I imagine, retains the antient site it had at the time of the conquest. The present building consists of a nave and one aile. The last was built by a <HI>Blethyn Drow,</HI> of the house of <HI>Mostyn,</HI> to whom that part belongs.</P>
<P>THE two <HI>Mertons,<NOTE PLACE="marg">MERTON.</NOTE> Uch glan</HI> and <HI>Isglan,</HI> are adjacent townships. In the reign of <HI>Edward</HI> I. (before his conquest) the lands of the men of <HI>Merton,</HI> to the amount of sixteen plough-lands, were taken from them, and bestowed on the abbot and convent of <HI>Ba∣singwerk,</HI> against the laws of <HI>Wales,</HI> and the custom of the country; and contrary to the peace between the King and Prince <HI>Lhewelyn</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pewel, 360.</NOTE>.

<P>FOLEBROC,<NOTE PLACE="marg">FOLEBROC.</NOTE> or <HI>Feilebroc,</HI> belonged to the monks of <HI>Basingwerk:</HI> and is mentioned in the confirmation of the grants to that con∣vent by <HI>Henry</HI> II. and again in the charters renewed to it by <HI>Lhe∣welyn ap Jorwerth,</HI> and <HI>David ap Lhewelyn,</HI> princes of <HI>North Wales.</HI> The monks had a grange on it, and right of pa∣sturage on the mountain, in common with neighboring in∣habitants<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Dugdale's Monast.<HI>I.</HI> 720, 721.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE products of this parish are corn of every sort excepting rye. Little cheese or butter is made here for sale, as the grass is chiefly consumed by horses; for the farmers are greatly em∣ployed in carrying the minerals of the country: the same may be said of the shire in general. Every cottager has his potatoe garden, which is a great support to them; and was a conveni∣ency unknown fifty years ago. The lower parts are well wooded; and much timber is at times sold to <HI>Leverpool</HI> and other places, at good prices; much is also used at home in the mines.</P>
<P>THE collieries of <HI>Mostyn</HI> and <HI>Bychton</HI> have been worked for a very considerable space;<NOTE PLACE="marg">COAL.</NOTE> and in the last century supplied <HI>Dublin</HI> and the eastern side of <HI>Ireland</HI> with coal. They are at present but in a low state; partly from the rise of the works at <HI>Whitehaven,</HI> but more from the loss of the channel of the <HI>Dee;</HI> which in the beginning of this century flowed so close to our shore, that ships of two hundred tons lay under this parish, with their
<PB N="16" REF="25"/>
cables twisted round the trees. At this time vessels of sixty or seventy cannot approach nearer than two miles, the <HI>Dee</HI> now flowing under the opposite shore. Still we load a few vessels for <HI>Ireland</HI> and some parts of <HI>North Wales.</HI> Much is also consumed by the neighboring smelting-houses, and the inland parts of <HI>Denbighshire.</HI> The improvements of land by lime has of late occasioned a great comsumption of coal by the farmer, and by the persons who burn it for sale.</P>
<P>THE coal is of different thickness, from three quarters to five yards. The beds dip from one yard in four to two in three. They immerge beneath the estuary of the <HI>Dee;</HI> are dis∣covered again on the south side of <HI>Wiral</HI> in <HI>Cheshire,</HI> as if cor∣responding with some of the <HI>Flintshire:</HI> they remain as yet lost, on the northern part of the same hundred; but are found a third time in vast quantities in <HI>Lancashire,</HI> on the opposite side of the <HI>Mersey.</HI> Their extent from west to east, in this county, may be reckoned from the parish of <HI>Llanasa,</HI> through those of <HI>Whiteford, Holywell, Flint, Northop,</HI> and <HI>Hawarden.</HI> Our coal is of diffe∣rent qualities, suited to the variety of demands of the several sorts of founderies in the neighborhood. Beds of canal are met with; inferior indeed in elegance to those of <HI>Lancashire,</HI> but greatly coveted by the lime-burners. Sometimes is also found the <HI>Peacock</HI>-coal of Doctor <HI>Plot</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hist. Staffordshire, 126.</NOTE>, remarkable for the beauty of its surface, glossed over with the changeable brilliancy of the colors of that beautiful bird.</P>
<P>COALS were known to the <HI>Britons</HI> before the arrival of the <HI>Romans,</HI> who had not even a name for them: yet <HI>Theophrastus</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">In his book on stones.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="26"/>
describes them very accurately, at lest three centuries before the time of <HI>Caesar:</HI> and even says that they were used by workers in brass. It is highly probable that the <HI>Britons</HI> made use of them. It is certain they had a primitive name for this fossil, that of <HI>Glo;</HI> and as a farther proof, I may add, that a flint-ax, the instru∣ment of the <HI>Aborigines</HI> of our island, was discovered stuck in cer∣tain veins of coal, exposed to day in <HI>Craig y Parc</HI> in <HI>Monmouth∣shire</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ph. Tr. <HI>N<SUP>o</SUP></HI> 335. p. 500.</NOTE>; and in such a situation as to render it very accessible to the inexperienced natives, who, in early times, were incapable of pursuing the veins to any great depths. The artless smelters of antient times made use of wood only in their operations, as we find among the reliques of their hearths, as shall be observed hereafter.</P>
<P>A VERY useful species of ash-colored greasy clay is discovered over one of the beds. It resists the fire remarkably well; and has been used with great success in the mineral smelting fur∣naces.</P>
<P>THE beds of sandstone are frequent in the lower parts of the parish,<NOTE PLACE="marg">FREESTONE.</NOTE> and reach within half a mile of the mountain; when the stratum changes: first to a blackish shale, soon dissolluble by exposure to the air; after that to a whitish limestone, or to a hard chert. Both are found in strata a of vast thickness:<NOTE PLACE="marg">LIME.</NOTE> the first is burnt into excellent lime, and is also used as a flux for lead ores. The common sort of houses are built with it; for which it is less proper by reason of its excessive dampness at change of weather.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="27"/>IN the township of <HI>Tre-mostyn,</HI> near the shore, is a cliff of a very singular appearance, looking like the semi-vitrified <HI>lava</HI> of a <HI>volcano.</HI> The stratum is in front universally changed in its dispo∣sition, and run into a horrible mass of red and black; often porous, but in all parts very hard. In it is a hollow, a vein in which was lodged the pyritical matter that took fire, and caused the phaenomenon. Its fury chiefly raged towards the front, and diminished gradually in the internal part of the bed; which, at some distance within land, appears only discolored. The stratum is a sandstone of the common sort<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Da Costa's <HI>Fossils,</HI> 133.</NOTE>. I am informed, that these appearances are not uncommon in <HI>Derbyshire;</HI> and that Mr. <HI>Ferber,</HI> an ingenions <HI>Swede,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Whitehurst,</HI> our ingenious countryman, hath taken notice of them in their writings.</P>
<P>THE chert is the <HI>petros<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ex</HI> of the later writers. It is of a flinty nature,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHART.</NOTE> and is the only stone that resembles flint in our county. The annotator on <HI>Cronsted</HI> justly remarks, that the true flint abounds in chalk, which is an absorbent earth, as chert does in the neighborhood of limestone, which is also calcareous. As yet, this species of stone has nor been found of any use. I sus∣spect, that in case it was burnt and ground, it might prove serviceable in making a coarse stone ware, as the nodular flints are in making the finer.</P>
<P>THE hilly part of our parish has been for a long succession of years rich in minerals of lead and calamine. Some years ago, about seventeen hundred of copper ore was discovered; but none since, notwithstanding it has been diligently searched

<PB N="19" REF="29"/>after I shall suspend enquiry after these and other minerals and fossils of this tract, till I am about to leave the part of <HI>Flint∣shire</HI> productive of these sources of wealth. I shall here only take notice of a vegetable, rare in other places, which grows on certain parts of the mountain in plenty; and in <HI>May</HI> makes a pretty appearance with its white flowers. This is the <HI>arenaria saxatilis,</HI> or mountain chickweed, engraven in the annexed plate; with a scarlet kind of mushroom, unnoticed by <HI>Linnaeus;</HI> but described by Mr. <HI>Ray,</HI> p. 18. N<SUP>o</SUP> 5. of his Synopsis of <HI>British</HI> Plants.</P>
<P>IN my road to the next parish south of this, I take that which lies on the shore; and pass by the antient smelting-house of <HI>Llanerchymor,</HI> which is still in use for fusing of lead ore, and ex∣tracting of silver.</P>
<P>THE sea, or the estuary of the <HI>Dee,</HI> lies at a small distance on the left, a verdant marsh intervening. The hundred of <HI>Wiral,</HI> a portion of <HI>Cheshire,</HI> is seen on the other side; a hilly tract, woodless and dreary, chequered with corn-lands and black heaths; yet formerly was so well cloathed, as to occasion this proverbial distich:</P>

<P>THE tides recede here so very far, as to deny us any variety of fish. The species most plentiful are of the flat kind; such as flounders, a few plaice, small soles, and rays. Dabs visit us in <HI>November;</HI> and in the last year was taken that rare species or flounder the <HI>whiff,</HI> whose figure is given in the annexed plate. The weever is very common here: other species are taken ac∣cidentally.</P>
<P>THE herring in this sea is extremely desultory. At times they appear in vast shoals, even as high as <HI>Chester;</HI> arrive in the month of <HI>November,</HI> and continue till <HI>February;</HI> and are followed by multitudes of small vessels, which enliven the channel.

<PB N="21" REF="32"/>of colors; being spotted with triangular marks of pure white in rusty brown. In size it is somewhat inferior to a jackdaw: the bill very strong, sharp, and fitted for the piercing of trees; which makes it very destructive to timber. It inhabits the vast forests of firs; from which it has been styled <HI>Pica abietum guttata.</HI> Like the jackdaws, it also nestles in lofty towers; and like them is very noisy. Its food is nuts, which it breaks with its bill; the cones of firs, acorns, berries, and insects.

<P>ACCORDINGLY, the first notice I find of it is in the life of St. <HI>Werburg,</HI> by <HI>Bradshaw;</HI> who informs us, that <HI>Richard,</HI> on his return out of <HI>Normandy,</HI> where he had been educated, be∣gan his reign with an act of piety. He attempted, in 1119, a pilgrimage to the well of St. <HI>Wenefrede;</HI> but either in going or returning, was attacked by the <HI>Welsh,</HI> and obliged to take shelter in <HI>Basingwerk.</HI> He applied to St. <HI>Werburg</HI> for relief; who miraculously raised certain sands between <HI>Flintshire</HI> and <HI>Wiral,</HI> and thus gave means to his constable to pass to his assistance: which sands, from that time were called the <HI>Constable's Sands. Bradshaw</HI> styles the place of his retreat an abby; a proof that here had been a religious community before the time usually
<PB N="23" REF="34"/>
assigned for the foundation of this house. I must also draw from Lord <HI>Lyttelton</HI>'s authority (for I can find no other) that this castle was demolished by the <HI>Welsh</HI> in the reign of <HI>Stephen</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hist. Henry II.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>HENRY II. in 1157, after his escape from the ambuscade of <HI>Eulo,</HI> left <HI>Basingwerk</HI> restored, well fortified, and manned<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">M.Paris, 129.</NOTE>, in order to secure a retreat on any future disaster. He did the same by the caste of <HI>Rudland.</HI> In his days the inland parts of our county were a dangerous wild of forest. After his defeat he never trusted himself among our woods; but made his marches along the open shores.</P>
<P>THE same monarch left another species of garrison<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Powel, 208.</NOTE>; for he established here a house of knights templars, a military order introduced into <HI>England</HI> in the preceding reign. They were first instituted in the Holy Land for the protection of pilgrims; and possibly <HI>Henry</HI> might have, the same view in fixing them here, to secure the <HI>English</HI> devotees in performing their vows to our neighboring saint, who seems about this time to have come into reputation. It is singular, that these religious knights were allowed at their institution only one horse between two; yet so greatly did they flourish, that about the year 1240, or a hundred and fifty years after their institution, the order had acquired, in different parts of <HI>Christendom,</HI> nineteen thousand manors.</P>
<P>THIS castle was but of very short duration; for in 1165, the gallant prince <HI>Owen Gwynedd</HI> laid siege to it, took<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">The same, 223.</NOTE> and levelled it to the ground; after which the name occurs no more as a

For my part, I believe it to be of greater antiquity; but do not pretend to derive its origin. No light into the matter can be collected from the charters preserved by Sir <HI>William Dugdale.</HI>
There are three of them, either serving to confirm the antient donations, or confer new: in each is mention of the earl as a benefactor; but there is not the left hint of his having been the founder. I must attribute that honor to one of the princes of <HI>Wales;</HI> for both <HI>Lhewelyn ap Jor∣werth,</HI> and his son <HI>David,</HI> in their respective charters recite, that they give and confirm the several donations to GOD, St.<HI>Mary,</HI> the monastery of <HI>Basingwerk,</HI> and the monks, which had been bestowed on them by their predecessors for the salvation of their souls.</P>
<P>RANDAL was certainly a great benefactor; for it appears, that before his days the monks had only a chapel here. From that period it became considerable; and about that time part of the present buildings were erected, for the conveniency of its inhabit∣ants, who were of the <HI>Cistorcian</HI> order.</P>
<P>THE architecture is mixed. Here appears what is called <HI>Saxon;</HI> having the round arches and short columns in some parts; and the</P>
<P><PB REF="36"/><FIGURE>

</FIGURE></P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="37"/>Gothic narrow slips of high-pointed windows in others. The first: species had not fell out of use, and the last was coming into fashion, in the days of the first great benefactor.</P>
<P>THE church lay on the east side; but is now totally de∣stroyed. The refectory is pretty entire; and on one side has a great recess, with two round arches and a plain in front.</P>
<P>ABOVE were the cells for the lodgings of the monks, with a small window to each.</P>
<P>THE chapel of the knights templars is a spacious building. The windows are long, narrow, and pointed; the pilasters be∣tween them on the inside slender and elegant.</P>
<P>THERE are some remains of offices, used at present by a tanner. Within less than fifty years, much of the habitable part was standing; and sometimes used by the worthy family, the <HI>Mostyns</HI> of <HI>Trelacre:</HI> a lady now living was born within the walls.</P>
<P>DURING the preparations for the conquest of <HI>Wales</HI> by <HI>Ed∣ward</HI> I. the abby was under the protection of the <HI>English.</HI> There are extant two orders for the purpose, providing that they had no commerce with what are styled the <HI>Welsh</HI> rebels<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ayloff's Rotuli Walliae, 68, 82.</NOTE>. I imagine that the convent was firmly attached to the victor; for I have been informed that there are, among the lists of summons in the Tower, writs for calling the abbot to parlement, in the 23d, 24th, 28th, 32d, and 34th of <HI>Edward</HI> I.</P>
<P>ACCORDING to the valuation of its revenues in 1534, the gross sum at the dissolution was, according to <HI>Dugdale,</HI> 150 <HI>l.</HI> 7 <HI>s.</HI> 3 <HI>d.</HI>;

<P>THE particular endowments, as I collect from <HI>Dugdale</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Menasticon, I 720, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE>, were these: <HI>Henry</HI> III. by charter, grants and confirms ten <HI>librates</HI> in <HI>Longenedale</HI> in <HI>Derbyshire,</HI> with the church of <HI>Glossope,</HI> and all its appertenances, to be held by them as freely as <HI>William Peverel</HI> held the same in the time of <HI>Henry</HI> his grand∣father. The same charter confirms the donations of <HI>Ranulph</HI> carl of <HI>Chester,</HI> and other barons, <HI>viz. Holywell, Fulbrook,</HI> the chapel of <HI>Basingwerst,</HI> the antient residence of the monks, with the mills and their appertenances; likewise <HI>Holes,</HI> and a moiety of <HI>Lecche,</HI> and one hundred shillings of the revenues of <HI>Chester,</HI> the gift of the said earl. <HI>Calders</HI> with its inhabitants, and finally, <HI>Kethlenedei,</HI> the gift of <HI>Robert Banastre.</HI></P>
<P>LHEWELYN AP JORWERTH, prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> and cotemporary with <HI>Henry</HI> III. confirms all the donations of his ancestors; particularly the site of their house, the mill before their gate, and the land before their doors; which last was granted to them by <HI>Ranulphus,</HI> and his brother <HI>Aeneas.</HI> The same grant gives them also the land of <HI>Meredeth Wawor</HI> in <HI>Holywell; Ful∣brook,</HI> a community of pasturage on the mountains; <HI>Hanot de le Weceb,</HI> and <HI>Creicgraft,</HI> with all their appertenances. His son and successor <HI>David,</HI> by another charter, confirms the dona∣tions of his father, and adds the lands of <HI>Huttred,</HI> brother to <HI>Meredeth Wawor</HI> of <HI>Holywell;</HI> the grange of <HI>Fulbrook;</HI> the church of <HI>Holywell,</HI> and the chapel of <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lsul;</HI> and the land and pasturage</P>

Also, the fifth part of the fish taken in his fisheries at <HI>Rudland;</HI> and the tenth of the fish belonging to him in other parts. He confirms to them all the village of <HI>Wenhewm,</HI> with all its inhabitants and appertenances, being the gift of <HI>Howen de Porkenton,</HI> and confirmed by <HI>Helyso.</HI> He at the same time confirms the lands and pasturage in <HI>Penthlin,</HI> the gift of his father.</P>
<P>THIS charter is dated from <HI>Coleshill</HI> in 1240, and witnessed by <HI>Hugh</HI> bishop of St. <HI>Asaph,</HI> and his chancellor, the famous <HI>Ednyfed Vychan,</HI> and others.</P>

<P>THE abby also was possessed of the hospital or chapel of <HI>Sponne</HI> near <HI>Coventry,</HI> which had been originally founded by <HI>Hugh Ceveilioc</HI> earl of <HI>Chester,</HI> who probably bestowed it on these monks<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Dugdale's Warwickshire, I. 197.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE revenues of the abbot amounted in the whole, reckoning <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>rising from the mills, lands, cows, and sheep, to 46 <HI>l.</HI> 11 <HI>s.</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Willis's St. Asaph, 176.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IN 1540, the house and lands in the neighborhood were granted to <HI>Henry ap Harry,</HI> whose only daughter <HI>Anne,</HI> by her

marriage with <HI>William Mostyn</HI> esquire, of <HI>Trelacre,</HI> conveyed it into that family, in which it now remains.</P>
<P>I CANNOT recover the names of any more than two of the abbots; both of the same with my own. <HI>Thomas ap Dafydd Pennant</HI> presided over the house in the time of <HI>Guttun Owain;</HI> a bard who flourished in the year 1480, and celebrates the hospitality of the abbot, in some verses printed in the collection of Mr. <HI>Rhys Jones.</HI> The poet is so liberal of his praise as to say, <HI>That he gave twice the treasure of a king in wine.</HI></P>
<Q><L>Er bwrw yno, aur Brenin</L>

<P>HE speaks also of his works of utility; of the water and of the windmills he erected. Neither is he silent on a subject, pleasing to every <HI>Welsh</HI> ear, the pedigree of his patron; whom he derives from <HI>Edwin</HI> and from <HI>Elidir ap Rhys Sais,</HI> a direct descendant from <HI>Tudor Trevor</HI></P>
<P>THE last abbot conformed, and married <HI>Angared</HI> daughter to <HI>Gwillim ap Gryssydd ap Gwillim.</HI> The <HI>Harleian</HI> MS. calls him Sir <HI>Thomas Pennant.</HI> The remains of a very antient oak, still to be seen near the ruins of the house, is called the abbot's, and is supposed to be his cotemporary.</P>
<P>THE road from hence is remarkably picturesque, along a little valley, bounded on one side by hanging woods, beneath which the stream hurries towards the sea, unless where interrupted by the fre∣quent manufactories. Its origin is discovered at the foot of a steep hill,<NOTE PLACE="marg">ST. WENEFREDE'S WELL.</NOTE> beneath the town of <HI>Holywell,</HI> or <HI>Trefynnon,</HI> to which it gave the name. The spring boils with vast impetuosity out of a rock;</P>

<HEAD>S<SUP>T</SUP> WENEFRED'S WELL, MOSS, &amp; SEAL.</HEAD>
</FIGURE></P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="43"/>and is formed into a beautiful polygonal well, covered with a rich arch supported by pillars. The roof is most exquisitely carved in stone. Immediately over the fountain is the legend of St. <HI>Wenefrede,</HI> on a pendent projection, with the arms of <HI>Eng∣land</HI> at the bottom. Numbers of fine ribs secure the arch, whose intersections are coupled with some sculpture.</P>
<P>SOME are mere works of fancy; grotesque figures of animals: but the rest allude chiefly to the <HI>Stanley</HI> family. This building, and the chapel over it, rose from the piety of that great house, who left these memorials of their benefactions: there are besides some marks of illustrious donors; for example, the profile of <HI>Margaret,</HI> mother to <HI>Henry</HI> VII. and that of her husband the earl of <HI>Derby,</HI> cut on the same stone.</P>
<P>THE compliments to the <HI>Stanlies</HI> are very frequent. The <HI>wolf</HI>'s head is the arms of the earls of <HI>Chester:</HI> it is inclosed in a garter, in respect to Sir <HI>William Stanley,</HI> knight of that order, who had been chamberlain of that city, and justiciary of <HI>North Wales.</HI> The tun with a plant issuing out of it, is a <HI>rebus,</HI> the arms of his wife <HI>Elizabeth Hopton,</HI> allusive to her name. This proves, that the building was erected before 1495, in which year Sir <HI>William</HI> lost his head. The other badges of the same house are, the stag's head; the eagle's leg; and the three legs, the arms of the isle of <HI>Man.</HI></P>
<P>WE also find, that <HI>Catherine</HI> of <HI>Arragon,</HI> widow to prince <HI>Arthur,</HI> and afterwards the unfortunate wife of his brother <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. was a benefactress to this building; at lest her arms appear here: three pomegranates in a shield, surmounted with a crown; the badge of the house of <HI>Granada,</HI> in memory of the
<PB N="30" REF="44"/>
expulsion of the Moors, by her father <HI>Ferdinand</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sandford's Geneal. 475.</NOTE>. The eagle seems also to belong to her, being one of the supporters of the arms of her family.</P>
<P>OVER one of the lesser arches, on each side of the well, are the dragon and gre-hound, the supporters of the arms of <HI>Eng∣land</HI> during the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> VII. and part of that of <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. The first was born by <HI>Henry</HI> VII. as a badge of the house of <HI>Tudor,</HI> which derived itself from <HI>Cadwalader,</HI> last king of <HI>Britain,</HI> who bore on his ensign a red dragon. <HI>Henry,</HI> in imitation of him, at the battle of <HI>Bosworth</HI> carried on his standard a red dragon, painted on white and green silk; which afterwards gave rise to the office of <HI>Rouge dragon</HI> among the heralds.</P>
<P>ON one side of a wall that supports the roof, was painted the tale of the tutelar saint; at present almost defaced: over it is inscribed, <HI>in honorem Sanctae Wenefredae,</HI> V. &amp; M.</P>
<P>IN another wall is an elegant nich, in which stood a statue of the Virgin <HI>Mary;</HI> pulled down, as I have been informed, in the year 1635.</P>
<P>I have also heard, that there had been another of St. <HI>Wene∣frede.</HI> To grace the image on high festivals, it is probable, that <HI>Isabel,</HI> countess of <HI>Warwick,</HI> widow to the great <HI>Richard Beauchamp,</HI> left to St. <HI>Wenefrede,</HI> in 1439, her gown of russet velvet<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Dugdale's Warwickshire, I. 414.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>OVER this spring is a chapel,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAPEL.</NOTE> of the same date with the other building: a neat piece of gothic architecture; but in a very ruinous state. This had been a free chapel, in the gift of the
<PB N="31" REF="45"/>
bishop, with the reserve of a stipend to the chapter; but the rest of the offerings were to be expended on the chapel. In <HI>Richard</HI> III.'s time, the abbot and convent had from the crown ten marks <HI>yerely, for the sustentacione and salarie of a prieste, at the chapelle of St. Wynesride</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Harleian <HI>MSS.</HI> N<SUP>o</SUP> 433, 338.</NOTE>. The chapel is the property of <HI>John Davies</HI> esquire, of <HI>Llanerch.</HI> The well is common; for I find by a decision of the court of chancery, on a law-suit respecting the lordship of <HI>Holywell,</HI> between Sir <HI>John Egerton</HI> knight, and <HI>John Eldred;</HI> chancellor <HI>Ellesmere</HI> decrees, <Q>That on calling to mind, that within the said manor there is a fountain or well of antient and worthy memory, he doth not think fit that the petitioner, or any other, should have the property thereof, notwithstanding the general words of the grant of the manor: and therefore his lordship doth order, that notwithstanding the said grant, that the well shall continue as now it is, or heretofore hath been; saving to the petitioner, and his heirs and assigns, the benefit of the stream and watercourse, with the appertainances.</Q></P>
<P>THERE are two different opinions about the origin of this stream. One party makes it miraculous: the other assert it to be owing only to natural causes. The advocates for the first, deliver their tale thus:</P>
<P>IN the seventh century lived a virgin of the name of <HI>Wenesrede,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">OF SAINT WING FREDE.</NOTE> of noble parents; her father's name was <HI>Thewith,</HI> a potent lord in the parts where <HI>Holywell</HI> now stands; her mother's, <HI>Wenlo,</HI> de∣scended from an antient family in <HI>Montgomeryshire,</HI> and sister to
<PB N="32" REF="46"/>
St. <HI>Beuno. Beuno</HI> assumed the monastic habit, retired to <HI>Clynnog,</HI> in <HI>Caernarvonshire,</HI> where he built a church and founded a con∣vent. After completing this work of piety, he visited his rela∣tions in <HI>Flintshire,</HI> and obtaining from his brother-in-law a little spot at the foot of the hill on which he resided, erected on it a church; and took under his care his niece <HI>Wenefrede.</HI> A neighboring prince of the name of <HI>Cradocus,</HI> son of King <HI>Alen,</HI> was struck with her beauty, and at all events determined to gratify his desires. He made known his passion to the lady; who, affected with horror, attempted to escape. The wretch, enraged at the disappointment, instantly pursued her, drew out his sabre, and cut off her head. <HI>Cradocus</HI> instantly received the reward of his crime: he fell down dead, and the earth opening, swallowed his impious corps. <HI>Hidgen,</HI> in his <HI>Polychronicon</HI> adds, that even the descendents of this monster were visited with hor∣rible judgments, to be expiated only by a visit to this well, or to the bones of the saint at <HI>Salop.</HI></P>

<P><PB N="33" REF="47"/>THE severed head took its way down the hill, and stopt near the church. The valley, which, from its uncommon dryness, was heretofore called <HI>Sych nant,</HI> now lost its name. A spring of uncommon size burst from the place where the head rested. The moss on its sides diffused a fragrant smell<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Life of St. <HI>Wenefrede,</HI> from which the materials for this part are mostly taken.</NOTE>.

<P>ST. BEUNO took up the head, carried it to the corps, and, offering up his devotions, joined it nicely to the body, which instantly re-united. The place was visible only by a slender white line encircling her neck, in memory of a miracle, which surpassed far that worked by St. <HI>Dionysius,</HI> who marched in triumph after decapitation, with his head in his hands, from <HI>Mont martre</HI> to St. <HI>Dennis</HI>'s<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Histoire de l'abbaye de St. Denys, 76.</NOTE> or that of St. <HI>Adelbertus,</HI> who, in like circumstances, swam across the <HI>Vistula.</HI></P>
<P>TO conclude: St. <HI>Wenefrede</HI> survived her decollation fifteen years. She died at <HI>Gwytherin</HI> in <HI>Denbighshire,</HI> where her bones
<PB N="34" REF="48"/>
rested till the reign of king <HI>Stephen;</HI> when, after divine admo∣nition, they were surrendered to the abby of St. <HI>Peter</HI> and St. <HI>Paul</HI> at <HI>Shrewsbury.</HI> The memory of the two great events, that of her first death is celebrated on the 22d of <HI>June:</HI> that of her translation the 3d of <HI>November.</HI></P>
<P>A FRATERNITY and gild was established in honor of our faint at <HI>Shrewsbury.</HI> It had its common seal, which, through the kindness of my friend, Mr. <HI>Henry Levingston,</HI> is now in my pos∣session. It is of copper, of the form expressed in the plate. In the centre is a representation of the martyrdom; above is a cross in form of a T, placed between the letters <HI>T. m.</HI> which mark the time when the fraternity was instituted, during the abbacy of <HI>Thomas Mynde;</HI> who was elected in 1459, and died in 1499, a period in which these religious societies were much in fashion. The T or cross refers to the church of <HI>St. Cross</HI> within this monastery. Beneath are probably the arms of the house, a sword and a key, symbols of its tutelar apostles; and round the mar∣gin is this inscription:</P>
<Q><L>sigillū cōe pfraternitat beate wenefride virginis</L>
<L>ī ecc̄īa sc̄e cruc ī fra monaster. sc̄i petri salopie.</L></Q>
<P>A bell belonging to the church was also christened in honor of her. I cannot learn the names of the gossips, who, as usual, were doubtlessly rich persons. On the ceremony, they all laid hold of the rope; bestowed a name on the bell; and the priest sprinkling it with holy water, baptized it in the name of the Father, <HI>&amp;c. &amp;c.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Stavely</HI>'s Hist. Churches, 130.</NOTE> He then cloathed it with a fine garment: after this the gossips gave a grand feast, and made great pre∣sents,
<PB N="35" REF="49"/>
which the priest received in behalf of the bell. Thus blessed, it was endowed with great powers; allayed (on being rung) all storms; diverted the thunder-bolt; drove away evil spi∣rits. These consecrated bells were always inscribed. The in∣scription on that in question ran thus:</P>
<Q><L>Sancta <HI>Wenefreda,</HI> Deo hoc commendare memento,</L>
<L>Ut pietate sua, nos servet ab hoste cruento.</L></Q>
<P>And a little lower was another address:</P>
<Q>Protege Prece pia, quos convoco, virgo <HI>Maria.</HI></Q>
<P>AFTER her death, her sanctity, says her historian, was proved by numberless miracles. The waters were almost as sanative as those of the pool of <HI>Bethesda:</HI> all infirmities incident to the human body met with relief; the votive crutches, the barrows, and other proofs of cures, to this moment remain as evidences pen∣dent over the well. The saint is equally propitious to Protestants and Catholics; for among the offerings are to be found these grateful testimonies from the patients of each religion.</P>
<P>THE Holy Father gave all encouragement to the piety of pil∣grims to frequent this fountain. Pope <HI>Martin</HI> V<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Selden's <HI>notes on</HI> Michael Drayton, 289.</NOTE>. in the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> V. furnished the abby of <HI>Basingwerk</HI> with pardons and indulgences, to sell to the devotees. These were renewed again in the reign of queen <HI>Mary,</HI> by the interest of <HI>Thomas Goldwell</HI> bishop of St. <HI>Asaph</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Powel</HI>'s notes on <HI>Girald.

<PB N="36" REF="50"/>
<HI>Elizabeth.</HI> Multitudes of offerings flowed in; marks of gratitude from such who had received benefit by intercession of the virgin.</P>
<P>THE resort of pilgrims of late years to these <HI>Fontanalia</HI> has considerably decreased; the greatest number are from <HI>Lancashire.</HI> In the summer, still a few are to be seen in the water in deep devotion up to their chins for hours, sending up their prayers, or performing a number of evolutions round the polygonal well; or threading the arch between well and well a prescribed number of times. Few people of rank at present honor the fountain with their presence. A crowned head in the last age dignified the place with a visit. The prince who lost three king∣doms for a mass, payed his respects, on <HI>August</HI> 29th 1686, to our saint; and received as a reward a present of the very shift in which his great grand-mother <HI>Mary Stuart</HI> lost her head<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The late Doctor <HI>Copper</HI> of <HI>Chester</HI>'s MSS.</NOTE>.

<P>WE, whose ancestors, between two and three centuries ago, abridged our faith to the mere contents of the Old and New Testament, and to the creed called the <HI>Apostles,</HI> do not think
<PB N="37" REF="51"/>
the belief in the above, and other legends, requisite. I refer the reader to the arguments used by the antiquary Doctor <HI>Powel,</HI> in his notes on the Itinerary of <HI>Giraldus Cambrensis,</HI> and to bishop <HI>Fleetwood</HI>'s annotations on the life of the saint, for proofs against the truth of the tale: but with Protestants, and temperate Catho∣lics, it carries with it self-confutation.</P>
<P>THE waters are indisputably endowed with every good quality attendant on cold baths; and multitudes have here experienced the good effects that thus result from natural qualities, implanted in the several parts of matter by the divine Providence in order to fulfil his will. Heaven for a short period deigned to convince a dark and obdurate age with a series of miracles; which were de∣livered down to succeeding times, as incontestible proofs of the reality of the divine mission. Without them, a sufficient ground of trust and reliance upon the Supreme Being has long since been established. Second causes innumerable are dispersed throughout the universe, subordinate to the FIRST. Every element proves to us a medicine or a bane, as suits His unerring dispensa∣tion. We cannot want, we cannot have the mediation of poor departed mortals. The supposition would be bestow∣ing on them the attributes of the Deity; omnipresence and omniscience.</P>
<P>SOME eminent botanists of my acquaintance have reduced the sweet moss,<NOTE PLACE="marg">MOSSES</NOTE> and the bloody stains, to mere vegetable produc∣tions, far from being peculiar to our fountain. The first is that kind of moss called a <HI>Jungermannia,</HI> imperfectly described and figured by <HI>Dillenius,</HI> in his history of mosses; which has induced us to give a new engraving of it.

He says, the stone to which it adheres easily betrays itself by the color, being as if smeared with blood; and if rubbed, yields a smell like violets. <HI>Micheli,</HI> in his <HI>Genera</HI> of plants, mentions the same<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Gen. 210. tab. 89. fig. 3.</NOTE>; and <HI>Schwenckselt</HI> discovered it among the vegetables of <HI>Silesia.</HI> He calls it a <HI>muscus subrubeus,</HI> and informs us, that the smell is grateful to the heart; and that, if put among cloaths, it gives them a good scent, and serves to drive away moths<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Cat. Stirp. &amp;c. Silesiae, 382.</NOTE>. <HI>Linnaeus</HI> says<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">As quoted by Baron Halier, N<SUP>o</SUP> 2090.</NOTE>, that it is of use in eruptive disorders.</P>
<P>ABOVE the well stands the church, dedicated to St. <HI>Wenefrede.</HI> The parish wakes are celebrated in <HI>November,</HI> the time of her translation. The living, before the dissolution, belonged to the abby of <HI>Basingwerk;</HI> and is a vicarage in the gift of <HI>Jesus College Oxford,</HI> which nominates; and <HI>John Davies</HI> esquire, of <HI>Llanerch,</HI> the lay-rector, presents.</P>
<P>ABOVE the church is a hill called <HI>Bryn y Castell,</HI> narrow, and very steep on the sides, projecting at the end over the little valley. On this might have stood the castle of <HI>Treffynnon,</HI> or St. <HI>Wenefrede,</HI> built by <HI>Randle</HI> III. earl of <HI>Chester,</HI> in the year 1210 <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Powel, 262.</NOTE>. There are not at present any vestiges left.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="53"/>IT is singular, that no mention is made in the Doomsday book of either chapel, church, or well; yet townships now of less note are named; such as <HI>Brunford Caldecote,</HI> and others. Notwithstanding bishop <HI>Fleetwood</HI>'s opinion, I think the legend of St. <HI>Wenefrede</HI> was known previous to that survey; for the very name of <HI>Holywell</HI> is <HI>Saxon,</HI> probably bestowed on it before the Conquest, on account of the imputed sanctity of the well.</P>
<P>THE spring is certainly one of the finest in these kingdoms; and, by the two different trials and calculations lately made for my information, is found to fling out about twenty-one tons of water in a minute. It never freezes; or scarcely varies in the quantity of water, in droughts or after the greatest rains. After a violent fall of wet, it becomes discolored by a wheyey tinge.</P>
<P>THE stream formed by this fountain runs with a rapid course to the sea, which it reaches in little more than a mile's distance. The industry of this century hath made its waters of much com∣mercial utility. The principal works on it at this time are bat∣tering mills for copper; a wire-mill, coarse paper mill, snuff∣mill, a foundery for brass; and at this time, a cotton manu∣factory is establishing, the success of which will be an extensive blessing to the neighborhood.</P>
<P>DURING the reign of pilgrimages, nothing but a corn-mill or two, the property of the monks, found employ for this bene∣ficial stream.</P>
<P>THE town was also very inconsiderable till the beginning of this century; the houses few, and those for the most part
<PB N="40" REF="54"/>
thatched; the streets unpaved; and the place destitute of a mar∣ket. The flourishing mines, that for some time were discovered in the neighborhood, made a great change in the appearance, and introduced the effects of wealth. The town, or rather township, contains somewhat more than two thousand souls.</P>
<P>THE monks of <HI>Basingwerk</HI> obtained for it the grant of a fair and a market. The first has been dropt beyond the memory of man. The market was also lost, till it was renewed by letters patent, dated <HI>Jan.</HI> 20th, 1703, granted to Sir <HI>John Egerton</HI> baronet. The patent also contains a grant of three fairs, <HI>viz.</HI> on the 23d of <HI>April,</HI> the <HI>Tuesday</HI> in <HI>Easter</HI> week, and the 2d of <HI>September.</HI> The market has been the most flourishing in <HI>North Wales;</HI> but the fairs never could be established.</P>
<P>THE situation of the town is pleasant and healthy. On the back is a lofty hill, at times extremely productive of lead ore. Towards the sea is a pretty valley, bounded by woods: the end finishes on one side with the venerable abby. To such who requ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e the use of a cold-bath, few places are more proper; for, besides the excellence of the waters, exceeding good medical assistance, and comfortable accommodations, may be found here; and the mind entertained, and the body exercised, in a variety of beautiful rides and walks.</P>
<P>MY next visit was to <HI>Flint.</HI> I took the lower road, by the shore, blackened with the smoke of smelting-houses; and, in the more flourishing times of the collieries, with vast stacks of coal. The last township in <HI>Ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ywell</HI> parish, on this side, is that of <HI>Coleshill;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">COLESHILL.</NOTE> which gives name to a hundred, and was so called from its abundance of foss<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l fuel. This place had at the
<PB N="41" REF="55"/>
Conquest four villeyns, two boors, and a <HI>Radman.</HI> This last seems to have been the same with the <HI>Rod</HI> or <HI>Rad-knights,</HI> who, by the tenure of their lands, were bound to ride with or for their lord, as often as his affairs required.</P>
<P>AFTER crossing a small brook, enter the town of FLINT:<NOTE PLACE="marg">FLINT.</NOTE> a place laid out with great regularity; but the streets far from being completed. The removal of the greater and the lesser sessions, and its want of trade, will be farther checks to its improve∣ment. This town gave name to the county, which, with that of <HI>Caernarvon, Merioneth,</HI> and <HI>Anglesey,</HI> composed the four an∣tient <HI>North Welsh</HI> shires, formed by <HI>Edward</HI> I. immediately after the conquest of our principality. I cannot assign any derivation of the word: our county is totally destitute of the fossil usually so called. I can only remark, that it is purely <HI>Saxon;</HI> and, not∣withstanding it is not mentioned in the Doomsday book, was called so before the Conquest.</P>
<P>THIS place also seems to me to have been the same with what was named <HI>Colsul</HI> or <HI>Coleshill.</HI> I can find no other site for the chapel of <HI>Colsul,</HI> granted by <HI>David ap Llewelyn</HI> to the abby of <HI>Basingwerk.</HI> The present <HI>Flint</HI> probably went at this period under both names. There is no trace of any chapel in the neighborhood excepting this; nor any other place of consequence enough to tempt our princes to live at. It was called in the Doomsday book <HI>Coleselt;</HI> and was possessed by <HI>Robert</HI> of <HI>Rudland. Edwin</HI> held it from him, and as a free-man. Here was one hide of land taxable.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="56"/>THE whole place appears to have been founded in times of dan∣ger; and every provision made against an attack from a people recently subdued, and who had submitted reluctantly to a foreign yoke. The town is formed on the principle of a <HI>Roman</HI> en∣campment, being rectangular, and surrounded with a vast ditch and two great ramparts, with the four regular <HI>portae,</HI> as usual with that military nation. I shall hereafter give a conjecture of the probability of its having been a <HI>Roman</HI> station.</P>
<P>THE public buildings within this precinct are the church, the town-hall, and the jail; not one of which is any ornament to this little capital. The church, or rather chapel, is dedi∣cated to St. <HI>Mary;</HI> and is only a perpetual curacy under <HI>Nor∣thop.</HI> I imagine this to have been the <HI>capella de Colsul</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dugdale Monast. I. 720.</NOTE>, belong∣ing to the abby of <HI>Basingwerk,</HI> mentioned in the charter of <HI>David ap Llewelyn;</HI> at lest, I can trace no other. <HI>Flint,</HI> in that time, was probably comprehended under the name of <HI>Colsul.</HI></P>
<P>THE castle stands on a low free-stone rock that juts into the sands, a little north-east of the town; and was once joined to it by a bridge which led to the outwork, called the <HI>Barbican;</HI> a square tower, with a gateway, now entirely demolished. Within was a court surrounded with a ditch faced with a wall, that joined by means of a drawbridge to the main fortress; whose entrance, for better security, was little more than a postern.</P>
<P>THE castle is a square building, with a large round tower at three of the corners, and a fourth a little disjoined from the other, and much larger than the rest. This is called the <HI>double tower.</HI></P>
<P><PB REF="57"/><FIGURE>
<HEAD>FLINT CASTLE</HEAD>
</FIGURE></P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="58"/>
It had been joined to the castle by a drawbridge, and is of great thickness. It has a circular gallery beneath, vaulted, with four arched openings into a central area, a little more than twenty-two feet in diameter. In one part, the gallery is suddenly low∣ered, and goes sloping towards the castle; and then rising upwards, makes a sort of communication with an upper gallery.</P>
<P>THIS was the Keep, or strong part of the castle, and the same that the <HI>French</HI> call <HI>le Dongeon;</HI> to which, as <HI>Froissart</HI> informs us, the unfortunate <HI>Richard</HI> II. retired, as the place of greatest security, when he was taken by <HI>Bolingbroke.</HI></P>
<P>THE channel of the <HI>Dee</HI> at present is at some distance from the walls; but formerly flowed beneath. There are still in some parts rings, to which ships were moored.</P>
<P>THE founder of this castle is uncertain. <HI>Cambden</HI> attributes it to <HI>Henry</HI> II. and his noble hisstorian<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lord <HI>Lyttelton.</HI></NOTE> is of the same opinion. After his escape at <HI>Euloe,</HI> it is possible that he might have begun a fortress here for security in future times; that he might have left it incomplete; and that it was finished by <HI>Edward</HI> I. The rolls of the last reign mention the place several times.</P>
<P>IN the year 1277, there was an order for proclaming a mar∣ket and fair to be held at <HI>Flint;</HI> and the same was afterwards done through <HI>Cheshire,</HI> and the cantreds of <HI>Wales.</HI></P>
<P>IN 1280, appears an order for the custody of the gate of the castle of <HI>Flint.</HI> Perhaps this might have been the year in which it was first garrisoned.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="59"/>
IN 1283, the town received its first charter; was made a free borough; and the mayor sworn faithfully to preserve its liberties. This is dated at <HI>Flint</HI> on the 8th of <HI>September:</HI> it was confirmed again in the 2d and 3d years of <HI>Philip</HI> and <HI>Mary,</HI> and afterwards in the 12th of <HI>William</HI> III.</P>
<P>IN 1283, the burgesses also received a grant from <HI>Edward,</HI> of timber out of the woods of <HI>Northop, Ledebroke</HI> the greater and lesser, <HI>Keldreston, Wolsynton, Weper,</HI> and <HI>Sutton,</HI> in order to smelt their lead ore; and at the same time a right of pasturage in the same woods.</P>
<P>IN 1290, there is an order for superintending the works of this castle, and those of <HI>Rudland</HI> and <HI>Chester;</HI> places of the first importance, on the borders of a new-conquered country<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rotuli <HI>Walliae,</HI> 98</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE first great event that occurs to me respecting this for∣tress is in the year 1280, when the <HI>Welsh,</HI> wearied with the reitera∣tion of oppression, as a signal of general insurrection, surprized the place<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">76.</NOTE>; at the same time that <HI>David,</HI> brother of <HI>Llewelyn;</HI> took <HI>Hawarden;</HI> and <HI>Rees</HI> the son of <HI>Malgon,</HI> and <HI>Griffith ap Meredeth ap Owen,</HI> seized the castle of <HI>Aberystwyth</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Powel, 337.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>HERE, in 1311, the infatuated son of our conqueror received from exile his imperious favorite <HI>Piers Gaveston,</HI> who had landed at <HI>Caernarvon</HI> from <HI>Ireland</HI><NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Stow, 214.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>FROM this period I find nothing remarkable relating to this fortress, till the year 1335, the 9th of <HI>Edward</HI> III. when ap∣pears an order to the Black Prince, as earl of <HI>Chester,</HI> to take in
<PB N="45" REF="60"/>
safe custody the castle of <HI>Flint</HI> and <HI>Rudland,</HI> and to furnish them with men and provisions<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rotuli <HI>Scotiae,</HI> 165.</NOTE>. <HI>Edward,</HI> in his 7th year, had by charter granted to his gallant son the castles of <HI>Chester, Beeston, Rudland;</HI> and <HI>Flint,</HI> and all his lands there; and also the cantred and lands of <HI>Englefield,</HI> with all their appertenances, to have and to hold to him and his heirs, kings of <HI>Eng∣land</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Dodridge, 125.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IN this <HI>dollorous castell</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">III.</NOTE>, as <HI>Halle</HI> styles it, was deposed the unfortunate monarch <HI>Richard</HI> II. To this place he was inveigled by <HI>Henry Percy,</HI> earl of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> with the assurance that <HI>Bolingbroke</HI> wished no more than to be restored to his own pro∣perty; and to give to the kingdom a parlement. <HI>Northumberland,</HI> with a small train, first met <HI>Richard</HI> at <HI>Conway,</HI> then on his re∣turn from <HI>Ireland.</HI> The king distrusted the earl; who, to re∣move all suspicion, went with him to mass, and at the altar took an oath of fidelity. The king fell into the snare; pro∣ceeded with the earl for some time, till he perceived, about the precipice of <HI>Penmain Rhôs,</HI> a large band of soldiers with the <HI>Percy</HI> banners. The king would have then retired; but <HI>Nor∣thumberland,</HI> catching hold of his bridle, forcibly directed his course. The poor prince had just time to reproach him with his perjury, telling him, that the God he had sworn upon that morning, would do him justice at the day of judgment<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Carte. II. 634.</NOTE>. He caused the king to dine at <HI>Rudland,</HI> and conveyed him that night to <HI>Flint.</HI> The next morning, he was astonished with the sight, of a numerous army, commanded by his rival, in full march
<PB N="46" REF="61"/>
along the sands: they soon surrounded the castle. The prince descended from the <HI>Keep</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This place, in old writers, is called the <HI>Dongeon,</HI> or <HI>Donjon:</HI> according to SKINNER, <HI>Turris mu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ssima pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pagnaculi ad ultimum receptum;</HI> but the word be∣ing now entirely applied to the miserable hole in which captives are confined, I shall still retain the term <HI>Keep.</HI></NOTE>, to meet <HI>Bolingbroke;</HI> who fell on his knees, and for a short space assumed a respectful appearance: but he soon stung off the mask; for, 'with a high sharpe voyce,' say Stow, <Q>the duke badde bring forth the kings horses; and then two little nagges, not worth forty franks, were brought forth; the king was set on the one, and the earl of <HI>Salisbury</HI> on the other; and thus the duke brought the king from <HI>Flint</HI> to <HI>Chester,</HI> where hee was delivered to the duke of <HI>Glocester</HI>'s sonne, and to the earle of <HI>Arundel</HI>'s sonne, that loved him but a little; for he had put their fathers to death; who led him strait to the castle<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Stow's</HI> Annals, 322.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>IF <HI>Froissart</HI> may be credited, <HI>Richard</HI> did not experience the pang of ingratitude from man alone: by a strange infection, it seized the most faithful of the brute creation; for his very dog deserted him, and fawned on his rival <HI>Bolingbroke,</HI> as if he understood and predicted the misfortunes of his old master, The story is so singular, that I shall relate it in the words of his noble translator Sir <HI>John Bouchier,</HI> lord <HI>Berners</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Fol. cccxii.</NOTE>; who, speaking of the transactions in <HI>Flint</HI> castle, says,</P>
<P><Q>AND as it was enfourmed me, kyng <HI>Richarde</HI> had a gray∣hounde called <HI>Mathe,</HI> who alwayes wayted upon the kynge, and woulde knowe no man els. For whan so ever the kynge

<P>IN the insurrection of <HI>Owen Glendwr, Henry</HI> prince of <HI>Wales</HI> procured from his father a pardon for several of his tenants in these parts, who took up arms in the cause of our valiant countryman<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Harlcian MSS. N<SUP>o</SUP> 2099.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THERE is another gap in the history till the troubles of the last century; when this county took an active part in support of royalty, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wn castle was garrisoned for the king, after having
<PB N="48" REF="63"/>
been repaired at the expence of Sir <HI>Roger Mostyn</HI> knight, who was appointed governor. In 1643, it was closely besieged by Sir <HI>Wil∣liam Brereton</HI> and Sir <HI>Thomas Middleton;</HI> and was defended by the governor till all provisions, even to horses, failing, he then surren∣dered it upon honorable terms.</P>
<P>'THIS colonel <HI>Mostyn,'</HI> says <HI>Whitelock,</HI> <Q>is my sister's son, a gentleman of good parts and mettle; of a very antient family, large possessions, and great interest in that country; so that in twelve hours he raised fifteen hundred men for the king<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Whitelock, 76.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>I MAY add, that after a long imprisonment in the castle of <HI>Conway,</HI> towards the conclusion of the war, his circumstances were so reduced, having spent sixty thousand pounds in the service of the crown, he was obliged to desert his family-seat, and live several years in an ordinary farm-house.</P>
<P>FLINT fell afterwards into the hands of the loyalists; for, under the year 1646, I find in the same historian, that the garrison seemed inclinable to come to a treaty. In <HI>November</HI> of the pre∣ceding year, it had received that of <HI>Beeston;</HI> which, after a most gallant defence, capitulated, and was allowed to march with all the honors of war to this place<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Rushworth 1. part iv. 136.</NOTE>. But on the 29th of <HI>August, Flint</HI> castle was surrendered to major-general <HI>Mytton;</HI> and in 1647 was, with other <HI>Welsh</HI> castles, dismantled by order of the house, directed to the general for that purpose<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Idem, Ibid. 456.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>ON the restoration, it was resumed by the crown, among its other rights, in which it still continues. The crown governs it
<PB N="49" REF="64"/>
by a constable, who is likewise mayor of <HI>Flint.</HI> These offices are at present filled by my friend <HI>Owen Brereton,</HI> esquire.</P>
<P>THE town, in conjunction with <HI>Caerwys, Rudland, Caergwrley,</HI> and <HI>Overton,</HI> sends a member to parlement. The election is made by the inhabitants paying parochial taxes; and the return made by the two bailiffs of <HI>Flint,</HI> appointed by the mayor. The borough land of this town extends over the whole parish, and also the township of <HI>Coleshill,</HI> in the parish of <HI>Holywell.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>Welsh</HI> boroughs and counties received the privilege of representatives by act of parlement of the 27th of <HI>Henry</HI> VIII.</P>

<P>ABOUT a mile from the town, on the lower road to <HI>Chester,</HI> stood a cross, whose pedestal I remember, which was called <HI>Atis-cross,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">ATIS-CROSS.</NOTE> and the land around is still called Croes-ati. This probably was a place of note; for, at the Conquest, it gave name to a very considerable hundred, at that time considered as part of <HI>Cheshire. Exestan</HI> was another, now given to <HI>Flintshire;</HI> which will be noticed in its place.</P>
<P>THERE is a tradition, that in very old times there stood a large town at this place; and it is said the foundations of build∣ings have been frequently turned up by the plough. But what is most remarkable, is the great quantities of scoria of lead, bits of lead ore, and fragments of melted lead, discovered in several spots here, and along the country, just above the shore, in the adjoining parish of <HI>Northop.</HI> These have of late been dis∣covered to contain such quantities of lead, as to encourage the washers of ore to farm the spots. In this tract, numbers of tons have been gotten within a small time, especially at <HI>Pentre</HI> FFWRN-DAN, or the <HI>place of the fiery furnace;</HI> a name it was al∣ways known by, and which evinces the antiquity of smelting in
<PB N="51" REF="66"/>
these parts; but this etymology was never confirmed, till by means of these recent discoveries.</P>
<P>In page 42 I mentioned my suspicion, that the precinct of <HI>Flint</HI> town once served to inclose a small <HI>Roman</HI> station: I am confirmed in my opinion, from the multitudes of <HI>Roman</HI> coins, <HI>Fibulae,</HI> and variety of antique instruments, lately discovered by the workmen in the old washes of this and the next parish; which prove that the <HI>Romans</HI> made this their port for exporting the metal, after it was fused from the ore of the adjacent mountains. Here might be placed a small garrison to protect the antient smelters, or to collect the duties, or to receive the tribute of metal. Previous to the settlement of the <HI>Romans</HI> in <HI>Britain, Strabo</HI> speaks<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lib. iv. p. 307.</NOTE> so slightly of our articles of commerce, as to say, they were not worth the expence of one legion and a few horse. He died in the year 25, before our country was scarcely known, except by the attempt of <HI>Caesar.</HI> But the trade, both in his days, and those of that great geographer, was carried on merely by exchange. The <HI>Britons</HI> worked their own mines of tin and lead; and in their room received from the foreign mer∣chants, earthen ware, salt, and works of brass<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Idem, lib. iii. p. 265.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IN a small time after the <HI>Romans</HI> had carried their arms through our island, they began to apply with vigor to the working of the mines. At first, the ore of lead was got with ease: it offered itself on the surface. In <HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>Gaul,</HI> much labor was required to dig it up; in <HI>Britain</HI> it was found near the common soil<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>Plinii,</HI> Hist. Nat. xxxiv. c. 17.</NOTE>; and in such quantities, that in <HI>Pliny</HI>'s time
<PB N="52" REF="67"/>
(who died in the year 79) there was a law (as there is at present in respect to black lead) limiting the annual produce<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Pliny,</HI> lib. xxxiv. c. 17.</NOTE>. Chance was the general detector of metallic riches in early times. The gold mines of <HI>Galicia</HI> were discovered by the plough<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Justin</HI> lib. xliv. c. 3.</NOTE>: those of <HI>India</HI> by the casting up of hillocks by the pismires<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Strabo, lib. ii. p. 121. lib. xv. p. 1028.</NOTE>: the silver mines of <HI>Spain</HI> by the casual burning of a wood<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Diod. Siculus, lib. v. c. 2.</NOTE>. Tri∣vial accidents, even to this age, have been the cause of mighty mineral discoveries. The great mine at <HI>Halkin</HI> was discovered by ditching: that at <HI>Llangynnog</HI> in <HI>Montgomeryshire,</HI> by the slip of a woman ascending a hill, and baring the vein with her feet. Many of the works that we suspect to have been <HI>Roman</HI> are very shallow; generally in form of trenches, through which they pursued the veins. They probably were discovered from slight causes. But as ore grew more scarce, and avarice en∣creased, the pursuit went as deep as the art or powers of the time would permit. <HI>Imus in viscera ejus (Telluris) et in sedes ma∣nium opes quearimus</HI><NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Plinii, lib. xxxiii. Proemium.</NOTE>. <Q>We descend into the very bowels of the earth; and seek riches even in the seat of departed spirits.</Q> The want of gun-powder was a great impediment. Instead, we find that great fires were used; the rock intensely heated, and cracks formed in it by the sudden infusion of water; <HI>Pliny</HI> says of vinegar<NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">Lib. xxxiii. c. 4.</NOTE>. The wedge or pick-ax<NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE> was then insinu∣ated into the apertures, and the stone or the ore forced out. Miners often discover the marks of fire in antient mines. I am in possession or a little wedge, five inches and a quarter long,
<PB N="53" REF="68"/>
presented to me by Mr. <HI>Smedly</HI> of <HI>Bagilt Hall,</HI> discovered in working the deep fissures of <HI>Dalar Goch</HI> rock in the parish of <HI>Disert</HI> in this county. This little instrument affords a proof of its antiquity, by being almost entirely incrusted with lead ore. It had probably lain in the course of some subterraneous stream, which had brought along with it the leaden particles, and de∣posited them on the iron.</P>
<P>PICK-AXES of an uncommon bulk, and very clumsy, have been discovered in the bottom of the mineral trenches. These seem to have been the same with the <HI>Fractaria</HI> of the <HI>Romans,</HI> pick-axes of enormous size, used by the miners in the gold mines<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pliny, <HI>lib.</HI> xxxiii. c. 4.</NOTE> of <HI>Spain.</HI> Buckets of singular construction, and other things of uses unknown at present, have been found among the antient mines.</P>
<P>IN many respects the antient methods of mining were similar to those in present use. The laborers worked by stems, relieving each other at stated times. They worked night and day, by the light of lamps. They drove levels, and sunk shafts, propping up the ground as they went on. They pursued the veins by forming drifts<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>; and finally, whenever the mines were molested with water, they had pumps, which flung up the water from the greatest depths they arrived at<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Diodorus Siculus, <HI>lib.</HI> v. c. 2.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>I HAVE mentioned above,<NOTE PLACE="marg">DIVINING ROD</NOTE> the casual detection of our mineral wealth. It will perhaps amuse the reader, by informing him, that in this county, within my memory, recourse was had to the <HI>virgula divinatoria,</HI> or divining rod; which, by powers sympa∣thetic
<PB N="54" REF="69"/>
with the latent ore, was to save the usual expences of search, and to point out the very spot where the treasures lay. A foreign adventurer, half knave half enthusiast, made the trial; but it proved as unfortunately unsuccessful to himself, as to his ad∣mirers. The instrument of the attempt was no more than a rod forked at one end, <Q>to be cut in a planetary hour on SA∣TURN'S <HI>day</HI> and hour; because SATURN <HI>is the significator of lead.</HI></Q> <HI>Jupiter, Venus, Sol,</HI> and <HI>Mercury,</HI> were also concerned in the time of the operation. <Q><HI>Jupiter,</HI> or <HI>Pars Fortunae,</HI> was to be in <HI>Conjunction, Sextile,</HI> or <HI>Trine</HI> to the LORD of the as∣cendent or second; and the better, if any reception happen; but BEWARE it be not by <HI>Square</HI> or <HI>Opposition;</HI> for that spoils all<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Hoosons</HI> Miner's Dictionary, article <HI>virgula divinatoria.</HI></NOTE>.</Q> Thus cut, it is laid by for use on a heap of wheat or barley; and from the rod of <HI>Moses,</HI> was also profanely called the <HI>Mosaical</HI> rod. This was to be held by the forks in both hands; and carried over the grounds suspected to contain the ore. It went unaffected over all the barren spots; but no sooner did it impend over a vein, than it pressed strongly down, and seemed to feel the same attraction as is between iron and the magnet. The sen∣sible <HI>Agricola</HI> speaks of this practice incidentally; and gives a long account of the process; but places no kind of faith in it, assuring us, that the skilful miner should follow the natural signs of the mineral veins, and despise the use of these enchanted sticks. He traces their origin from imposture. The magicians of <HI>Pharaoh</HI> made use of wands in their deception of the serpents: <HI>Minerva,</HI> by virtue of a wand, turned the aged Ulysses into a

young man; and again to his former state: <HI>Circe,</HI> by the ma∣gical powers of a rod, changed his companions into beasts: And lastly, <HI>Mercury,</HI> by the same means, impelled the watchful to sleep, and the sleepy to wake<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Agricola, de Re Metallica, <HI>lib.</HI> ii. p. 26, 27.</NOTE>. Let me now return to realities!</P>
<P>THE miners, in the earlier times of the <HI>Romans</HI> in <HI>Britain,</HI> seem to have been the subdued natives. <HI>Galgacus</HI> encourages his sol∣diers to conquer or die, by laying before them the dreadful consequences of a defeat; <HI>Tributa et</HI> METALLA, <HI>et caeterae servien∣tium panae.</HI> <Q>Tributes and mines, and all the dire penalties of slavery.</Q> <HI>Agricola</HI> himself verifies the prophetic spirit of our brave chieftain, by calling our mines the reward of victory. These were to be worked, not by the conquerors, but by con∣demned criminals, by slaves<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Diodorus Siculus,</HI> lib. v. c. 2. gives a melancholy account of these slaves; whose state can only be paralleled by the poor <HI>Indians</HI> in the mines of <HI>Potost.</HI></NOTE>, and <HI>Britons</HI> newly subjugated. It is probable, that when the island was entirely settled, this badge of slavery was taken away, and the miners were, as be∣fore the arrival of the <HI>Romans,</HI> voluntary laborers.</P>
<P>WHEN the ore was got, it was cleansed according to the modern method, and smelted in a furnace<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Plinii, <HI>lib.</HI> xxxiv. c. 16.</NOTE>, and cast into forms very nearly resembling the common pigs of lead.</P>
<P>OF such,<NOTE PLACE="marg">ROMAN PIGS OF LEAD</NOTE> I have seen three, found in different parts of Bri∣tain: the one in <HI>Hints,</HI> common, in the manor of <HI>Ralph Floyer</HI> esquire, in the county of Stafford, in the year 1771. It was found under ground, at the depth of four feet. Its length
<PB N="56" REF="71"/>
is twenty-two inches and a half; the weight a hundred and fifty-two pounds, about two pounds heavier than our common pigs of lead. On the upper surface is a rim; within that, in raised capitals, struck when the metal was hot, is this inscription: IMP.x.VESP¦<ABBR>VII</ABBR>xTxIMPx<ABBR>V</ABBR>xCOS. or <HI>Imperatore</HI> VES∣PASIANO <HI>Septimùm</HI> TITO <HI>Imperatore quintùm Consule:</HI> which answers to the year 75 or 76.</P>
<P>ON one side is the word DECEA, and at a distance the letter G. An ingenious Anonymous, in the Gentleman's <HI>Magazine</HI> of 1772, conjectures it to have been a C, made by the superintendant of the mine, or furnace, to shew either that the pig had paid duty, or was of due weight, or of proper purity. For my part, I am of opinion, that DECEA had once between it and the G, the letter N; which will render it DECEANG, or <HI>de Ceangis,</HI> the place which produced the ore; but by some accident that letter was defaced, and the G left seemingly un∣connected. This explanation will fling light on certain pieces of lead described by <HI>Cambden,</HI> to be taken notice of a few lines lower.</P>
<P>THIS curious antiquity is in the cabinet of Mr. <HI>Green,</HI> apothe∣cary in <HI>Litchfield;</HI> whose collection merits the attention of the inquisitive traveller; who may be assured of the most liberal reception from the worthy owner.</P>
<P>IN 1731, two pigs of the same kind, and of the same length, were discovered on <HI>Hayshaw</HI> moor, in the manor of <HI>Dacre,</HI> in the west riding of <HI>Yorkshire,</HI> on the estate of Sir <HI>John Ingleby</HI> of <HI>Ripley.</HI> One is preserved by the family: the other was pre∣sented to the <HI>British Museum.</HI> These also have an imperial inscrip∣tion
<PB N="57" REF="72"/>
on the top; <HI>Imperatore</HI> CAESARE DOMITIANO AUGUSTO <HI>Con∣sule Septimum.</HI> This was cast in the year 87, and under the same regulation, The other pig, which I saw at <HI>Ripley Hall,</HI> has the same inscription; and on one side the word <HI>Brig,</HI> signifying that it came from the country of the <HI>Brigantes</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide tab. IX.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IN the time of <HI>Cambden,</HI> twenty pieces of lead, similar to the above, were found near <HI>Halton</HI> in <HI>Cheshire;</HI> some inscribed, IMP. DOMIT. AUG. C. DE CEANG.; others, IMP. VESP. VII. T. IMP. V. COSS. These have been supposed to commemorate a victory over the <HI>Cangi;</HI> but it is evident that they were nothing more than pigs of lead brought here for use, or for transportation: and I am farther satisfied, that the ore which produced this lead was dug and smelted, either in that part of <HI>Flintshire</HI> an∣tiently called <HI>Tegangle,</HI> or the summer's residence of the <HI>Cangi,</HI> or <HI>Ceangi;</HI> or from the residence of the same order of people either in <HI>Derbyshire,</HI> or some neighboring county. This gives reason to suspect, that these <HI>Cangi,</HI> during their long vacant time, might sometimes engage in mineral concerns; and then the ore, when smelted, might receive the mark of the people from whom it was received. The pig of lead in Mr. <HI>Green</HI>'s cabinet, certain∣ly came from the <HI>Cangi</HI> of <HI>Derbyshire.</HI></P>
<P>FROM the regulation mentioned by <HI>Pliny,</HI> and all these impe∣rial inscriptions, it is clear, that the public took the mineral concerns into its own hands; and had their stamp-masters in proper places. I cannot pretend to fix the period of the first establishment. If the inscription to <HI>Claudius</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Cambden, I. 83. Horsely, 328.</NOTE>, on a mass of lead
<PB N="58" REF="73"/>
found in <HI>Henry</HI> VIII.'s time, near <HI>Wokey Hole</HI> in <HI>Somersetshire,</HI> be of the same kind with the former, it must have been within the year 49, the time of his ninth tribuneship.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Romans</HI> found such plenty of silver in the <HI>Spanish</HI> mines, that for some time they never thought it worth their labor to extract it from lead<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Strabo, <HI>lib.</HI> iii. p. 221.</NOTE>. In later times, they discovered an ore that contained silver, tin, and lead; and these three metals were smelted from it. It appears, that the first product was the tin; the second, the silver; and what <HI>Pliny</HI> calls <HI>Galaena,</HI> which was left behind in the furnace, and seems to be the same with our <HI>litharge,</HI> and being melted again, became lead, or, as the antients called it (to distinguish it from white lead or tin) <HI>black lead</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Plinii, <HI>lib.</HI> xxxiv. c. 16.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE <HI>British</HI> name of lead is lost. The only word we have to express an ore is <HI>mwyn;</HI> but the species is expressed by an ad∣junct, as <HI>mwyn aur,</HI> gold, <HI>mwyn plwm,</HI> lead ore; both which were probably derived from the <HI>Latin.</HI> The <HI>Romans</HI> made use of the word <HI>metallum</HI> to express ore, as well as the metal fused from it: the word <HI>minera</HI> is a word of a barbarous age, and pro∣bably derived from our <HI>mwyn.</HI></P>
<P>I SHALL finish this account of the <HI>Roman</HI> state of the lead concerns, with observing, that they appeared to have been well versed in metallurgy, and to have had their smelting-houses. The ruder <HI>Britons,</HI> before their conquest by the <HI>Romans,</HI> had a very simple process. They placed the ore in a hole in the ground, and mixed it with wood; which being fired, proved
<PB N="59" REF="74"/>
sufficient to melt the lead out of the soft and kindly ores of this country; a small gutter communicated with a second hole, into which the metal ran from the first. These artless slag-hearths are very frequent in our county, discovered by the quantity of <HI>scoria</HI> mixed with charcoal. Some of our modern smelters have endeavoured to extract the remaining part of the metal from these slags, but in vain; the antient smelters having so effectually done their business, as not to have left behind sufficient to pay the expences of a second operation: the most that could be procured from a ton of slags, amounting only to about a hundred and fifty pounds weight.</P>
<P>I CANNOT tell what use the <HI>Britons</HI> made of the metal, except∣ing as an article of commerce. I must not dare to assent to the tale of the venerable <HI>Bede</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lib. i. c. 2. p. 42.</NOTE>, who says, that the stakes driven in∣to the <HI>Thames,</HI> to obstruct the passage of <HI>Caesar,</HI> were wrapped round with lead. The project was useless, This expedient of the <HI>Britons</HI> was temporary; the stakes did not require such a covering to preserve them; and the metal of lead was surely very improper to point them with.</P>
<P>I am of opinion, that there had been in our country a succes∣sion of founderies of lead, from the time of the <HI>Romans</HI> to the present, at every period in which the civil commotions would permit them to be carried on. The <HI>Saxons</HI> worked the <HI>British</HI> mines as well as the <HI>Romans,</HI> and made frequent use of the lead in all works of ecclesiastial magnificence. The cathedral of <HI>Lindisfarn</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Bede</HI> Hist, lib, iii. c. 25. p. 131.</NOTE> was roofed with lead by its bishop <HI>Eadberct,</HI> about
<PB N="60" REF="75"/>
the year 652; that of <HI>York</HI> was covered with the same metal by its great prelate <HI>Wilfrid</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Eddii vit. Wilfridi, <HI>in</HI> Gale iii. 59.</NOTE>, in 669; and after that, <HI>Egelric,</HI> who was elected abbot of <HI>Crowland</HI> in 975, roofed the infirmary and chapel of that famous abby in a similar manner<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Ingulphi</HI> Hist. apud <HI>Cambden.</HI> Script, post. <HI>Bedem.</HI> 888.</NOTE>. I men∣tion these circumstances merely to shew, that the <HI>Saxons</HI> continued the business of smelting in the different parts of our island. We are assured that there have been, at different times, smelting-works for a century or two past in the parishes of <HI>Flint</HI> and <HI>Hawarden;</HI> and at present there is one in use in each of them.</P>
<P>I shall take this opportunity of mentioning incidentally the other minerals of <HI>Greet Britain,</HI> taken notice of by the antients, either as articles of trade or matters of curiosity.</P>
<P>TIN was aot only the first metal in these islands which we read of;<NOTE PLACE="marg">TIN</NOTE> but also the greatest object of commerce; and which originally led to the discovery of <HI>Great Britain</HI> by the <HI>Romans.</HI> The mercantile <HI>Phoenicians</HI> traded to the <HI>Silley</HI> islands, the <HI>Cassi∣terides,</HI> or land of tin, from the port of <HI>Cadiz,</HI> four hundred years before CHRIST. The <HI>Romans,</HI> for a considerable space, could not discover the place from whence the former procured the precious, metal. They attempted to detect the trade, by following the course of a <HI>Phoenician</HI> vessel; but the master, faithful to the in∣terest of his country, voluntarily run his ship ashore in another, place; preferring the loss of all, rather than suffer a foreign na∣tion to become partakers of so profitable a secret. The public immediately compensated his loss out of its treasury. This did
<PB N="61" REF="76"/>
but make the <HI>Romans</HI> more eager after the discovery; and after many trials, succeeded. <HI>Publius Crassus</HI> (father of <HI>Marcus Crassus</HI> the <HI>Triumvir)</HI> who was praetor, and governed <HI>Spain</HI> for several years, landed in the <HI>Cassiterides,</HI> and found the report of their riches verified<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Strabo,</HI> lib. iii. p. 265. to 309</NOTE>.</P>
<P>As soon as the <HI>Romans</HI> made a conquest of the country, they formed in the tin province camps and roads, still visible; and left behind vases, urns, sepulchres, and money, that exhibit daily proofs of their having been a stationary people in those parts<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Borlase, Antiq. Cornwall. p. 278.</NOTE>; and that <HI>Dunmonium</HI> extended even to the <HI>Belerian</HI> promontory, or the Land's-end; and was not, as some writers imagine, limited by the western parts of <HI>Somersetshire.</HI></P>
<P>IT is not to be imagined, that they could neglect a corner of our island, productive of a metal so useful in mechanics as tin, and which it yielded in such plenty, as to receive from that circumstance the name. So great was the intercourse that fo∣reign nations had with the inhabitants bordering on <HI>Belerium,</HI> as to give them a greater <HI>sçavoir vivre,</HI> and more extensive hos∣pitality, than was to be found in other parts of the island. They were equally expert in working the mines, and preparing the ore, which lay in earthy veins within the rocky strata. They melted and purified it, then cast it into rows of cubes, and car∣ried it to <HI>Ictis,</HI> the modern Isle of <HI>Wight:</HI> from thence it was transported into <HI>Gaul;</HI> conveyed from the place, it was landed at, on horses backs, a journey of thirty days, to the mouth
<PB N="62" REF="77"/>
of the <HI>Rhone,</HI> and then to the <HI>Massylians,</HI> and the town of <HI>Nar∣bon</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Diodorus Siculas, Ed. Wechel, 1604. <HI>pp.</HI> 209, 218.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WITH tin the <HI>Romans</HI> made mirrors; lined their vessels of brass to prevent its deadly effects<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Plinii,</HI> lib. xxxiv. c. 17.</NOTE>; made pewter, and from that a variety of domestic vessels; and, by the combination of other metals, formed a substance that mimicked silver<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>: so that a country, abundant in so useful an ore, would never be neglect∣ed by these wise people.</P>
<P>DID not <HI>Caesar</HI> and <HI>Strabo</HI> agree in their account,<NOTE PLACE="marg">COPPER</NOTE> I should ne∣ver have believed it was possible that the <HI>Britons</HI> could have neglected their rich mines of copper, and have been obliged at first to have imported that metal. Perhaps the ore was less ac∣cessible, and the art of fusion unknown; for islands, from their very situation, must remain longer ignorant of arts than conti∣nents; especially ours, which lay far to the west of the origin of all science.</P>
<P>STRABO says, that they imported works of brass; but it is as certain, that they afterwards did themselves fabricate that metal into instruments. The <HI>Celts,</HI> a <HI>British</HI> instrument, was made in this island. Numbers have been found in <HI>Yorkshire</HI> and in <HI>Essex</HI><NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Borlase, Antiq. 265, 266.</NOTE>, to∣gether with cinders, and lumps of melted metal; which evince the place of a forge. We cannot ascertain the period when the <HI>Britons</HI> had the art of adding the mixture of lead<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot"><HI>Plinii,</HI> lib. xxxiv. c. 9.</NOTE> that is found combined with them; or whether they learned it from their con∣querors,
<PB N="63" REF="78"/>
who were fully possessed of the art of fusing this, as well as other metals, is unknown. The <HI>Romans</HI> had their foun∣deries of copper in our island; and cast the metal into regular forms. A mass was found at <HI>Caer hėn,</HI> the antient <HI>Conarium,</HI> four miles above <HI>Conway,</HI> which probably was smelted from the ore of the <HI>Snowdon</HI> hills; where of late years much has been got. This mass is in shape of a cake of bees-wax; and on the up∣per part is a deep concave impression, with the words SOCIO ROMAE; across these is impressed obliquely, in lesser letters, <HI>Natsol.</HI> I cannot explain it, unless <HI>Nat.</HI> stands for <HI>natio,</HI> the people who paid this species of tribute; and <HI>sol.</HI> for <HI>solvit,</HI> that being the stamp-master's mark. These cakes might be bought up by a merchant resident in <HI>Britain,</HI> and consigned SOCIO ROMAE, to his partner at <HI>Rome.</HI> The weight of this antiquity is forty-two pounds; the diameter of the upper part eleven inches; the thickness in the middle two and three quarters<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tab. ix. This curious antiquity is preserved at <HI>Mostyn.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>CALAMINE,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CALAMINE.</NOTE> the <HI>Cadmia</HI> of <HI>Pliny</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Lib. xxxiv. c. 10.</NOTE>, and the stone-<HI>Cadmia</HI> of <HI>Strabo</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Lib, iii. 248.</NOTE>, abounds in the mineral parts of this island. The <HI>Ro∣mans</HI> knew its uses in making of brass; therefore cannot be sup∣posed to have overlooked so necessary an ingredient. The re∣mains of the brass-founderies, discovered in our kingdom, shew, that they were acquainted with it. The knowlege of this mine∣ral in after-ages was long lost. Before the reign of <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> much was imported from <HI>Sweden;</HI> but at that period it was dis∣covered again in the <HI>Mendip</HI> hills; and, fortunately, at the same time that the working of the copper mines in those of <HI>Cumberland.</HI>
<PB N="64" REF="79"/>
was renewed. Our county abounds with it; but, till within these sixty years, we were so ignorant of its value, as to mend our roads with it.</P>

<P>THESE metals have, in later times, been got in quantities sufficient to prove, that they might, in earlier time, be an ob∣ject worthy of conquest. In the reigns of <HI>James</HI> IV. and V. vast wealth was procured in the <HI>Lead Hills,</HI> from the gold col∣lected from the sand washed from the mountain.

In the reigns of <HI>Edward</HI> I. and III. there were very considerable works at <HI>Combmartin</HI> in <HI>Devonshire</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Camb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en, i. 47.</NOTE>: three hundred and thirty-seven miners, sent for out of <HI>Derbyshire,</HI> were employed in them; and the produce was so great as to assist <HI>Edward</HI> the third to carry on the war with <HI>France.</HI> In the beginning of this cen∣tury, much native silver was found on the estate of Sir <HI>John Erskine,</HI> in the county of <HI>Stirling;</HI> but the vein was soon ex∣hausted.</P>
<P>THE BRITONS were acquainted with the uses of gold and the art of coining before the arrival of the <HI>Romans;</HI> witness the golden sickles of the <HI>Druids,</HI> the coins found at <HI>Carnbre</HI> in <HI>Corn∣wall,</HI> and the coins of <HI>Cassivelaunus.</HI> They made use of diffe∣rent sorts of metals; but mostly of gold, being the easiest fused, and most capable of an impression. Doctor <HI>Borlase</HI> has preserved a series of these very early coins, from the rudest and most un∣intelligible impressions, to the period when the <HI>Britons</HI> made an attempt to form a face on their coins. All these are unlettered; a proof of their antiquity, and of their having been struck before their intercourse with the <HI>Romans.</HI> The first we know of, which is inscribed, is that of <HI>Cassrvelaunus,</HI> cotemporary with <HI>Caesar.</HI> The next is of <HI>Cunobeline,</HI> who had even been at
<PB N="67" REF="82"/>
<HI>Rome.</HI> As soon as the <HI>Britons</HI> became acquainted with the <HI>Ro∣mans,</HI> they made an essay to imitate their manner of coining; they put letters on them, elephants, and gryphons; things they were before unacquainted with. They were not suffered to make any progress in the art; for as soon as their conquest was effected, their coin was suppressed. The learned have en∣deavoured to trace these antient monies from the <HI>Phoenicians;</HI> but the comparison would not hold. The <HI>Gauls</HI> alone had some pieces similar: nor is this to be wondered at, since they and the <HI>Britons</HI> had a common origin, were neighbors, and might as well agree in the few arts they had, as in religion and lan∣guage<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Borlase</HI>'s <HI>Antiq. Cornwall,</HI> 242. tab. xix. tab. lxxxv.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>I NOW return to the subjects which occassioned this digres∣sion; and to give some account of the various antique instruments and coins found near <HI>Flint;</HI> and accompany the same by the more expressive description, a print.</P>
<P>N<SUP>o</SUP> 1. tab. viii. is a rich ornament of gold, in form of a but∣ton with a shank. It is composed elegantly with twisted wire, and studded with little globular bits of solid gold. This seems to have belonged to the bracelet or necklace (it is uncertain which), whose fragment is represented at N<SUP>o</SUP> 2. This is also composed of gold links, with round beads of a rich blue glass placed between every second link. Something similar to this is preserved by count <HI>Caylus,</HI> which is entire, and appears to have been a necklace<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Tom. iii. 312.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="83"/>N<SUP>o</SUP> 3. is a cylindric fragment of glass, probably part of some ornament, being of a rich blue color, and perforated as if it was designed to be strung. With it was found a thick piece of sea-green glass, part of a vase. Glass was among the earlier imports into <HI>Britain</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Strabo, 305.</NOTE>, when the wild natives were as much cap∣tivated with toys as the <HI>Indians</HI> of new-discovered countries are at present. At first they received these, and all their other vitreous commodities, by means of the <HI>Phaenicians,</HI> whose ca∣pital, <HI>Tyre,</HI> was pre-eminent in that manufacture. The <HI>glain nadroedd,</HI> or snake-gems, were at first obtained by way of exchange for the <HI>British</HI> exports. They were originally made by the <HI>Britons</HI> of stone. I have such a one in my cabinet. I have seen another in possession of the Reverend Mr. <HI>Hugh Davies,</HI> found in <HI>Anglesea.</HI> The traders soon learned to imitate what was prized so high in our island, in a more elegant material; and imported them as a most captivating article of commerce; in the same manner as circum navigators often mimic, in shewy brass, the utensils and weapons of <HI>Indian</HI> nations, in order to engage their friendship.</P>
<P>N<SUP>o</SUP> 4. is a small brazen head, with the back part affixed to iron. Perhaps this was one of the <HI>Sigillaria,</HI> or little images sold at the fairs, and presented usually to children<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Non cognoscis me? ego sum <HI>Policio,</HI> cui solebas sigillaria afferre. SENICA, Epist. 12.</NOTE>: and the fairs where these toys were sold went by the same name. A learned friend also supposes these to be miniature likenesses, which friends presented to each other as memorials.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="84"/>N<SUP>o</SUP> 5. is a <HI>Stylus,</HI> or instrument for writing on the <HI>ceratae ta∣bellae,</HI> or waxen tablets; which were made of thin leaves of lead, brass, or ivory, and covered with a thin coat of wax. The pen, if I may call it so, was usually of brass; one end pointed, in order to write; the other flatted, in order to efface what was wrong, by smoothing or closing the wax. <HI>Horace</HI> gives every writer most excellent advice, in alluding to this prac∣tice:</P>
<Q><L>Saepe <HI>Stylum</HI> vertas, iterum quae digna legi sint,</L>
<L>Scripturns.</L></Q>
<Q><L>Oft turn your style, when you intend to write</L>
<L>Things worthy to be read.</L></Q>
<P>N<SUP>o</SUP>; 6. is an instrument of very singular use: a narrow species of spoon, destined to collect, at funerals, the tears of the relations of the deceased, in order to deposit them in the little phials which were placed with the ashes in the urn, memo∣rials of their grief. Such are very frequently found: but the custom is far higher than that of classical antiquity; for the PSALMIST, in expressing his sorrows, alludes to it; THOU <HI>tellest my flittings; put my tears into thy bottle.</HI></P>
<P>N<SUP>o</SUP> 7. is an instrument seemingly designed for the purpose of dressing the wicks of lamps.</P>
<P>N<SUP>o</SUP> 8. may possibly be destined for the same uses.</P>
<P>N<SUP>o</SUP> 9. is a brazen bodkin.</P>
<P>N<SUP>o</SUP> 10. is a <HI>fibula</HI> or brotche, gilt, and enameled with deep blue in front.</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="85"/>N<SUP>o</SUP> 11. is a brotche, not unlike some used at present by the common Highlanders; whose dress, in its genuine simplicity, seems to have been borrowed from the <HI>Romans.</HI></P>
<P>N<SUP>o</SUP> 12. is also a species of button; but differs from the modern (as do all I have seen) by having no shank: instead, was a tongue, similar to those of the common <HI>fibulae.</HI> The front of this is enameled with deep blue.</P>
<P>N<SUP>o</SUP> 13. is another, of a very different form. This has also lost its <HI>fibulae;</HI> but the defect is very apparent.</P>
<P>N<SUP>o</SUP> 14. is a <HI>forceps;</HI> an instrument much in vogue among the <HI>Romans,</HI> for extirpating hairs. This was used for the same pur∣pose as the <HI>Turkish</HI> fair do the <HI>Rusma.</HI> The pincers here en∣graven are of great size and strength; perhaps used by some robust coxcomb, such as <HI>Persius</HI> rallies so severely, in his fourth satire, for his unbecoming effeminacy.</P>
<P>N<SUP>o</SUP> 15. 15. seem to have been instruments of sacrifice. One end of each is round, and of the form of an olive; and was intended for the use of the <HI>aruspices,</HI> to insinuate under the en∣trails of the victim, and to lift them up for the better inspec∣tion of the parts. The other extremity of the longer is formed into a spoon, for the purpose of putting the frankincense into the censer.</P>
<P>ACCORDING to the uncertainty that reigns respecting the uses of the antient instruments, I may hazard another conjecture, that they have been chirurgical instruments. The rounded ends were the probes; the hollow end of the longer, the spoon by which the balm was poured into the wound. The metal of which these instruments were made, proves, as count <HI>Caylus</HI> re∣marks<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Recueil d'Antiquitez, iv. 169.</NOTE>,</P>
<P><PB REF="86"/><FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="87"/>that the <HI>Romans</HI> had no apprehensions of its dangerous qualities. It is probable, that they had the art of tempering the metal so as to prevent the noxious effects.</P>
<P>N<SUP>o</SUP> 16. is a brass nail<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. Antiquaries may rejoice that the <HI>Romans</HI> preferred this metal to mouldering iron, which has pre∣served to them many a delicious morsel.</P>
<P>N<SUP>o</SUP> 17. tab. ix. is one of those <HI>Bullae,</HI> or amulets, called <HI>Ithyphallus,</HI> in form of a heart, with a figure (in which decency was little consulted) on the upper part. These were suspended from the necks of children, and originally designed to preserve them from the effects of envy; afterwards from all kinds of evil<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Pueris turpicula res in collo quaedam suspenditur, ne quid obsit bonae scaevae causa. VARRO de Ling. Lat. vi.</NOTE>. I cannot help thinking, that the good nurses had another view, that of attracting (in years of maturity) the affections of the fair towards their little favorite.</P>
<Q><L>Hunc optent generum Rex et Regina; puell<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e</L>
<L>Hunc rapiant. Quicquid calcaverit hic, Rosa fiat.</L></Q>
<Q><L>Wherever he treads let there rise up a rose,</L>
<L>And the ladies die for him wherever he goes.</L></Q>
<P>For it is well known, the obscene god, in all times, had his votaries among both sexes.</P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="88"/>THESE amulets also represented the god <HI>Fascinus,</HI> synonymous with that Deity. <HI>Pliny</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lib. xxviii, c. 4.</NOTE> relates, that he was not only the guar∣dian of infants, but of the emperors themselves; that the very vestals worshipped him; and the victors placed him (the physician of Envy) beneath their triumphal cars.</P>
<P>N<SUP>o</SUP> 18. is a locket with a hole at one end, in order to sus∣pend it round the neck, or fasten it to the wrist. This, per∣haps, was designed to hold a charm; and the holes on one side intended that the contents should transpire, and reach the object of fascination; whether of love; whether of am∣bition.</P>
<P>N<SUP>o</SUP> 19. a key; which gives one no very high idea of the ele∣gance of the <HI>Roman</HI> locksmiths.</P>
<P>N<SUP>o</SUP> 20. is one of a nicer form, and which served both for a ring and key. It possibly was designed for the cabinet of a <HI>Roman</HI> lady or some <HI>Bellus homo.</HI></P>
<P>N<SUP>o</SUP> 21. two rings; one of brass, the other of silver wire.</P>
<P>N<SUP>o</SUP> 22. a brazen weight belonging to a mason's levelling-in∣strument, answerable to a modern plummet.</P>
<P>N<SUP>o</SUP> 23. another of lead, belonging to a fishing-net.</P>
<P>N<SUP>o</SUP> 24. the tongue of an ordinary <HI>fibula.</HI></P>
<P>THESE are the subjects I thought most worthy of engraving: but there were multitudes of other things found in the same place; but almost all of them so mutilated or injured by time, as to be rendered quite unintelligible.</P>

<P><PB N="73" REF="90"/>ON leaving <HI>Flint,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">FINE PROSPECT.</NOTE> I took the road to <HI>Halkin;</HI> and immediately on quitting the town, began to ascend the steep slope of the county, fertile, and inclosed to the very edge of the mountain, which was parallel with the shore. The prospect improves the whole way; and from the heights expands to the north-east and south, into an almost boundless one. The estuary of the <HI>Dee</HI> appears beneath, with the city of <HI>Chester</HI> at its extremity. The peninsula of <HI>Wiral,</HI> a naked contrast to our country, limits the eastern side of our sea; and the western of the <HI>Mersey,</HI> rich in the commerce of <HI>Leverpool;</HI> beyond which stretches the great county of <HI>Lancashire,</HI> varying with plains and hills. The moun∣tains of <HI>Yorkshire</HI> and <HI>Derbyshire</HI> unite to bound the VALE ROYAL of <HI>England;</HI> and the rich and wooded tract about <HI>Northop</HI> and <HI>Hawarden,</HI> with its neighboring mountains, bring relief to the eye, tired with the contemplation of the far remote views.</P>
<P>THIS is but part of the magnificent terras formed by the pub∣lic road, that is continued from <HI>Hawarden</HI> to <HI>Clynnog</HI> in <HI>Caernar∣vonshire,</HI> varying continually with matchless changes of scenery.</P>
<P>THE first place of any note which occurs in the parish of <HI>Halkin,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">HALKIN.</NOTE> is a hamlet of a number of houses, called the <HI>Pen-tre,</HI> or hamlet; a name in <HI>Wales</HI> common to all such assemblages of dwellings, where there is no church; to distinguish it from <HI>Llan,</HI> where the place of devotion stands. This took its rise in the present century, and was much increased by the concourse of miners, on the discovery of a rich vein in the adjacent fields.</P>
<P>ALMOST contiguous, lies <HI>Halkin</HI> mountain; a vast tract, in the parish of the same name, and in those of <HI>Northop, Skeiviog,</HI> and <HI>Holywell.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="91"/>THE surface is common: the mineral the property of Lord <HI>Grosvenour,</HI> by virtue of a grant, made in 1634, to his ancestor, Sir <HI>Richard Grosvenour</HI> knight, by <HI>Charles</HI> I. of all the mines of lead or rakes of lead, within the hundreds of <HI>Coleshill</HI> and <HI>Rud∣land</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Harleian</HI> MSS. N<SUP>o</SUP> 2002. 9.</NOTE>. These tracts were before set on leases for a certain term of years. Thus <HI>James</HI> I. grants that term to <HI>Richard Gwynne,</HI> on payment of the annual acknowlegement of sixty-six shillings and eight pence; and a new one was granted in 1629, by a warrant from lord treasurer <HI>Weston,</HI> to <HI>Richard Grosvenour</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> <HI>Roger Grosvenour</HI> his son, and Mr. <HI>Thomas Gamul,</HI> for their joint lives, paying the usual rent, and a fine of ten pounds<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>I APPREHEND that this grant, and another similar, of the mi∣nerals in <HI>Bromefield</HI> and <HI>Yale,</HI> made to the same gentleman, are the first alienations of this nature from the crown; which, for many centuries after the Conquest, assumed the entire claim of all mines and minerals, by virtue of the royal prerogative. Sir <HI>John Pettus</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>Fodinae Regales,</HI> from p, 11. to 19.</NOTE> has preserved a series of grants, from the reign of <HI>Edward</HI> I. to that of <HI>Henry</HI> VII. in which they empower different persons to scarch for ore. Some of them are confined to particular counties, others to the kingdom in general: and the only prohibition is that of working beneath castles or houses; in gardens or meadows; the owners of which were to be indemnified in all damages they might sustain. <HI>Richard</HI> II. is the first prince who makes a general allowance. In his letters patent to <HI>Richard Wake,</HI> clerk, for searching for mines
<PB N="75" REF="92"/>
of gold and silver in the county of <HI>Devon</HI> for ten years, the adventurer had power to dig (paying damage to the owner of the ground) as well within liberties as without; and to pay one-tenth of the profit to the Holy Church, and a ninth into the exchequer.</P>
<P>THIS is not the first instance of the application of the tithe of ore to religious uses: <HI>Edward</HI> I. directs the same proportion to be payed to the parochial churches in <HI>Wales,</HI> out of the neighboring mines<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rotull Wallia (<HI>Sir</HI> Joseph Ayloff's) 75.</NOTE>. The abby of <HI>Basingwork</HI> had also a reve∣nue arising from the same source<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Tanner's <HI>Notit.</HI> Monast. 711.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>I CANNOT find that the owner of the ground, in case the mine was discovered in private property, was permitted to have any share of the profit, till the fifth of <HI>Henry</HI> VI. (1426); when the duke of <HI>Bedford,</HI> regent of <HI>France,</HI> received a ten years leafe of all the mines of gold and silver in the kingdom of <HI>England,</HI> paying to Holy Church a tenth, to the king a fifteenth, and to the lord of the soil the twentieth part. This allotment, though finall, is a proof of the justice and moderation that guided the actions of the protector of <HI>Henry</HI>'s infant years.</P>
<P>THESE regal grants were for every species of metal, except∣ing iron; for gold and silver, copper, tin and lead, and all other metals containing gold and silver. These two were the great object; yet the grants do not preclude the royal clame to the baser kinds.</P>
<P>DURING this reign, the art of refining, or the separation of metals from the ore, was made the ground of an imposture
<PB N="76" REF="93"/>
common enough in after times. There are not fewer than four instances of persons undertaking the transmutation of the baser metals into pure gold and silver; each of whom received the royal protection<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Rymer's Foedera,</HI> xi 68. 128. 240. 309. <HI>Henry</HI> IV. had passed an act, that <Q>none shall use to multiply gold or silver, nor use the craft of multiplication; and if any the same do, that he incur penalty of felony.</Q> This was aimed at persons, who, under pretence of transmutation, counterfeited the nobler metals. But afterwards it was found a check on the metallurgic art; as it extended even to the punishment of any ingenious refiner, who had discovered the method of getting more gold and silver out of the baser kinds than was known before, which occasioned the repeal of the act, in the first year of <HI>William</HI> and <HI>Mary,</HI> c. 30.</NOTE>, to prevent them from being interrupted in their operations: for certain malevolent people supposed they used unlawful arts, <HI>i. e.</HI> the art magic. In a supersticious age, this suspicion might have proved fatal to the projectors; who wisely assumed the most religious term for their mystery, to ob∣viate the malice of their enemies. The metals were not to be transmuted, but <HI>transubstantiated</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>; for they had great reason to imagine, that the believers of the word in the religious sense, would hardly contradict the feasibility of the project in the temporal meaning.

not die with this weak prince; for in 1476, we find that <HI>Ed∣ward</HI> IV. gave the same encouragement to one <HI>David Beaupe</HI> and <HI>John Marchaunt,</HI> to have for four years <HI>facultatem et scientiam philosophiae artificialem naturalem generationis a mercurio in aurum faciendo, et simili modo a mercurio in argentum:</HI> the liberty of changing <HI>mercury</HI> into gold and silver<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rymer, xii. 28.</NOTE>.

<P>EDWARD continued the mineral grants to several great men; among others to the earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI> the earl of <HI>Northumber∣land,</HI> and his brother <HI>Richard</HI> earl of <HI>Gloster.</HI> The farm was now encreased; they were to pay the king an eighth neat profit, the lord of the soil the ninth, and the curate of the place the tenth.</P>
<P>IN the short and turbulent reign of <HI>Richard</HI> III. no attention was paid to concerns of this kind; but his successor, <HI>Henry</HI> VII. in his very first year, discovered his ruling passion, avarice, by immediately appointing <HI>Jasper</HI> duke of <HI>Bedford,</HI> and several other persons of distinction, to be governors of all his mines in <HI>England</HI> and in <HI>Wales,</HI> paying to the king the fifteenth<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>Moses Stringer,</HI> author of <HI>Opera Mineralia explicata,</HI> calls it the <HI>fifth,</HI> which suits better the character of that monarch.</NOTE> of the <HI>pure</HI> gold and silver, and to the lord of the soil the eleventh, <HI>as it grows.</HI></P>
<P>ELIZABETH was the first of our princes who laid the founda∣tion for our mineral success, and for all the vast manufactures
<PB N="78" REF="95"/>
that arose in consequence. I read, that in 1452, <HI>Henry</HI> VI.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rymer, xi. 317.</NOTE>, (possibly on discovery of the imposture of metallic transmuta∣tions) had sent for, out of <HI>Hungary, Austria,</HI> and <HI>Bohemia,</HI> three experienced miners, and thirty assistants, to work his mines; so unskilled were the <HI>English</HI> at that time. The civil wars, which broke out immediately after, frustrated this wise measure. <HI>Elizabeth</HI> resumed it, being too quick-sighted not to see into the defects and wants of her kingdom. She not only adopted it, but improved on the plan. Our knowlege of minerals was almost extinguished, and of course the manufactures which depended on them. We imported our swords, our knives, stir∣rups, bits, and even our pins, out of <HI>Germany,</HI> through the channel of the <HI>Netherlands.</HI> Our works of brass, and even our wire, excepting a small quantity which was worked by hand, were of foreign fabrick. The first step taken by this politic princess, was to forbid the importation of these and several other articles, from parts beyond sea<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Statute 5th <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> c. 7.</NOTE>: the next, was to invite into her kingdom foreign miners, foreign smelters, and foreign arti∣ficers of metallic productions.</P>
<P>SHE next formed a corporation, under the title of THE SOCIETY FOR THE MINES ROYAL. The first governor was <HI>William</HI> earl of <HI>Pembroke:</HI> several men of rank were joined in the commis∣sion as assistants, and several citizens, and some foreigners of known experience in these matters. She likewise framed the same members into another corporation, which naturally depended on the former, <HI>viz.</HI> the SOCIETY FOR THE MINERALS AND BATTERY WORKS. These corporations were founded on <HI>May</HI> the 28th 1567.</P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="96"/>SOME progress had been made, a few years before, for the procuring materials for these new manufactures; for in 1563, she had granted the mines of eight counties, besides those in <HI>Wales,</HI> to <HI>Daniel Houghsetter:</HI> in 1564, she made another grant to <HI>Cornelius Devosse;</HI> and a third in the same year, more com∣prehensive than all, to <HI>Christopher Shutz,</HI> of all mines, minerals, and subterraneous treasures, (except copperas and allum) which shall be found in all other parts of <HI>England</HI> (not mentioned in the former patent) or within the <HI>English</HI> pale in <HI>Ireland,</HI> by the name of gold, silver, copper, tin, lead, quicksilver, <HI>cadmian</HI> ore, or <HI>lapis calaminaris;</HI> and all manner of ewres or oares, simple or pure, mixt or compounded for latten wire or steel, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> To each of these patentees an <HI>Englishman</HI> was joined.</P>
<P>IT is worth observing, that the crown, in most of these grants, lays absolute clame to all mines whatsoever, under a notion that they are royal mines; yet the prerogative could only be entitled to such which yielded gold and silver. The ori∣gin of this pretence arose from the king's right of coinage, in order that he might have the requisite materials; which would have confined him to the two noble metals. But until the happy period arrived when our constitution was established, and the royal and the private property justly distinguished, the subject was too weak to assert his rightful clame. ELIZABETH herself was too fond of the darling prerogative (even with all her boasted love to her people) to resign this part. Her pa∣tent to <HI>William Humfrey</HI> and <HI>Christopher Shutz</HI> is worded in the most unlimited manner; for it not only gave them power to sink shafts wheresoever they pleased (gardens, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> excepted),
<PB N="80" REF="97"/>
but to build houses requisite to carry on the works, not only upon the royal demesnes, but in the grounds of any of her subjects. The spirited <HI>Percies,</HI> in the person of <HI>Thomas</HI> earl of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> first withstood this invasion of his right. He contested with the crown the title to the copper mines in his manor of <HI>Keswick;</HI> but the lawyers decided against him, al∣leging, that although the crown had a power to grant away its manors, it had not the power to alienate the mineral, being per∣fectly linked to the prerogative of the crown.</P>
<P>BUT, as usual, the gentlemen of the long robe had two opinions respecting this point: some asserting, that if any gold or silver was found in the mines of baser metal, the whole would belong to the king; which, in fact, was bestowing all the mineral property on the crown, there being scarcely any base metal but what holds some particles of the nobler: others again, in a future reign, qualified this by saying, <Q>That although the gold or silver contained in the base metal of a mine, in the hands of a subject, be of less value than the base metal, yet if the gold or silver do countervail the charge of resining it, or be of more worth than the base metal spent in resining it, THIS IS A ROYAL MINE; and as well the base metal as the gold and silver in it, belong to the prerogative of the crown<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This opinion was given in 1640, 1641, and subscribed by <HI>Maynard, Glaw ville,</HI> and others, the first <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>vers of the time.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>SUCH was the state of the royal clame; so discouraging to the industry of the subject, till the great event of the REVO∣LUTION,
<PB N="81" REF="98"/>
when the crown, in the first year of <HI>William</HI> and <HI>Mary,</HI> fully gave up all pretensions to the mines of copper, tin, iron, and lead, notwithstanding gold or silver may be extracted from them in any quantities. By a following act, this right was again confirm∣ed; only the crown reserved to itself a power of purchasing, within thirty days after raising, all ores made merchantable, at the fol∣lowing rates: copper at 16 <HI>l. per</HI> ton, tin at 40 <HI>l.</HI> lead at 9 l.; and in default of such payment, the owners were at liberty to dispose of their ore as they pleased. Thus, as Mr. BLACKSTON<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">COMMENTARIES, 4 to, i. 294.</NOTE> ob∣serves, the private owners were not discouraged from working mines, through a fear that they may be clamed as royal; neither does the king depart from the just rights of his revenue, since he may have all the precious metal contained in the ore, paying no more for it than the value of the base metal is supposed to be; to which base metal the land-owner is by reason and law entitled.</P>
<P>SOME account of the ores and fossils of the mineral tract, which gave rise to this digression, will be given when I cross it again in the course of my journey.</P>
<P>FROM <HI>Pentre Halkin,</HI> I pursued my journey along the <HI>Chester</HI> road: and pass by the <HI>Llan.</HI> The church is dedicated to St. <HI>Mary;</HI> is a neat small edifice, lately re-built, partly by a brief, partly by subscription. It stood on the site of a church, men∣tioned in Doomsday book. At the Conquest, this tract bore the name of <HI>Alchene,</HI> from which the present name is taken. <HI>Brunford,</HI> a township now in the parish of <HI>Holywell,</HI> and a place
<PB N="82" REF="99"/>
called <HI>Inglecroft,</HI> at that time were joined to it. Doomsday book says, that here was a church and a presbyter, and three boors; a mill of five shillings annual value; and a wood half a league long, and forty perches broad; the whole valued at ten shil∣lings.</P>
<P>THE old <HI>British</HI> name of this place (still retained by the <HI>Welsh</HI>) is <HI>Lugan,</HI> from a saint, known, I believe, only in the <HI>Welsh</HI> calendar.</P>
<P>ABOUT two or three miles farther, in a woody morass on the left hand, are the foundations of an antient pile, called <HI>Llýs Edwin,</HI> or Llýs Llan <HI>Eurgain,</HI> originally the seat of <HI>Edwin ap Gronw,</HI> lord of <HI>Tegangle,</HI> about the year 1041. It continued in the family till the death of a descendant of his, <HI>Howel Gwynedd,</HI> who lost his life in the cause of <HI>Glendwr;</HI> when his forfeited estates were bestowed by <HI>Henry</HI> IV. on one <HI>Bryan Saxton.</HI> His posterity possessed them till the 17th of <HI>Henry</HI> VI. who granted them to Sir <HI>John Stanley,</HI> groom of the bedchamber<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">History of the house of <HI>Starley,</HI> 28.</NOTE>. They afterwards became the property of a younger branch of the <HI>Stanleys,</HI> and remained in their possession in the last century.

<P>I MUST not pass unnoticed a strong <HI>British</HI> post, which soars above the road,<NOTE PLACE="marg">MOEL Y GAER.</NOTE> about two miles to the right. It lies on the summit of a hill, and is surrounded with a great foss and dike
<PB N="83" REF="100"/>
of a circular form, with an entrance as usual to such places; and a small artificial mount within the precinct; a <HI>tribunal cespi∣titium,</HI> from whence our antient heroes might deliver their <HI>araith</HI> or <HI>allocutio,</HI> to animate their followers against the invading strangers. This post is called <HI>Moel y Gaer,</HI> or the hill of the fortress; a name common to several others of similar use. This seems to have been an out post of the <HI>Ordovices,</HI> in order to defend their country against the <HI>Roman</HI> invaders. We shall, towards the end of the volume, have occasion to mention the chain of posts along the <HI>Clwydian</HI> hills, from that next to the sea, to remote and internal parts. Our an∣cestry disputed the possession of their country by inches. Here they lodged their wives and children; to these places they drove their cattle out of the low country: they established in each numerous garrisons ready to sally forth and repel the foe; or to defend all that was dear to them, should the in∣vaders be hardy enough to attack them in their intrench∣ments.</P>
<P>IN later times, this spot proved fatal to a valiant partizan of <HI>Owen Glendwr. Howel Gwynedd</HI> (whom we lately mentioned) was surprized in a negligent hour, within this post, and there be∣headed.</P>
<P>NORTHOP,<NOTE PLACE="marg">NORTHOP</NOTE> a little town, lies next on the road. It bears the addition of <HI>North,</HI> to distinguish it from the other. <HI>Hope.</HI> The <HI>British</HI> name is <HI>Llan Eurgain,</HI> from St. <HI>Eurgen,</HI> daughter of <HI>Mal∣gwyn Gwynedd, ap Caswallon Law-hir, ap Enion Yrth, ap Cunedda Wledic,</HI> &amp;c. who died in 586.</P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="101"/>THE church is dedicated to St. <HI>Peter.</HI> The body is long and embattled: the tower lofty and handsome. Within are three effigiated tombs; one of a fat knight, whose name is lost, and figure much injured by time. Another of a short warrior, com∣pletely armed, and in good preservation: on his shield is a cross <HI>pattée,</HI> charged in the middle with a mullet between four others. The inscription is thus, <HI>Hic jacet Ith. Vach. ap Bledd Vach.</HI> I suspect him to have been a captain of <HI>Inglefield,</HI> mentioned in the pedigree of the <HI>Humphreyses</HI> of <HI>Bodlwyddan,</HI> and said to have been interred here. The third is of a lady, inscribed <HI>Llewc</HI> * * * *, and <HI>anno domini</HI> 1402. According to tradition, her name was <HI>Lleuci Llwyd,</HI> a celebrated beauty of that period; perhaps the same who was beloved by a noted bard, who coming to visit her after long absence, met with the same shock as the <HI>Che∣valier de Rancè</HI> did; for each found their beloved in her coffin. The bard fainted at the sight, revived, and composed an elegy on her. The <HI>Chevalier</HI> retired from the world, and founded the abby of <HI>La Trappe,</HI> famous for its religious austerities.</P>
<P>BETWEEN the eighth and ninth stone,<NOTE PLACE="marg">EULO CATSLE.</NOTE> about a quarter of a mile out of the <HI>Chester</HI> road, are the ruins of <HI>Eulo</HI> castle, placed on the edge of a deep wooded dingle. It is a small fortress, consisting of two parts: an oblong tower, rounded at the side, and guarded on the accessible places by a strong wall at some distance from it: an oblong yard, with the remains of a circu∣lar tower at its extremity, forms the other part. The towers are now finely over-grown with ivy, and command the view of three wooded glens, deep and darksome, forming a most gloomy solitude.</P>

<P>A CIRCUMSTANCE, consequential of this battle, proves, that the report of <HI>Edgar</HI>'s having extirpated the race of wolves out of the principality, was erroneous.

will pretend not to determine. It has been for centuries in ruins; for <HI>Leland</HI> speaks of it as <Q>a ruinus castle or pile, belonging to <HI>Hoele,</HI> a gentleman of <HI>Flyntshire,</HI> that by auncient accustume was wont to give the bagge of the sylver harpe to the beste harpir of <HI>North Walys,</HI> as by a privelege of his ancestors<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Leland Itin.</HI> V. 56.</NOTE>.</Q> The antiquary adds, 'that he dwellith at <HI>Penrine</HI> in <HI>Flyntshire.'</HI> We know of no such place in the county; but suspect that the gentleman intended was <HI>Thomas ap Richard ap Howel,</HI> lord of <HI>Mostyn,</HI> in whose family that privilege was long invested; that gentleman having been cotemporary with <HI>Leland.</HI></P>
<P>THE manor of <HI>Eulo</HI> was in the crown in the 26th of <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. who granted it to <HI>Peter Stanley</HI> esquire,<NOTE PLACE="marg">MANOR.</NOTE> gentleman of his hous∣hold, with the tolls of the market of <HI>Flint</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Harleian</HI> MSS.

<P>WITHIN this lordship are very considerable potteries of coarse earthen-ware;<NOTE PLACE="marg">POTTERIES.</NOTE> such as pans, jugs, great pots for butter, plates, dishes, ovens, flower-pots, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> There are fourteen works, which make annually between three and four thousand pounds worth. The ware is mostly exported to <HI>Ireland,</HI> and the towns on the <HI>Welsh</HI> coast; particularly to <HI>Swansey.</HI> There are besides six other works, for the making of fire-bricks, few clays being better fitted for the purpose of resisting the intense heat of the smelt∣ing-furnaces. These are made of different sizes; and some of
<PB N="88" REF="106"/>
those which are called bearers weigh two hundred pounds. Great quantities of tiles for barn-floors, and for rooms, are also made here; and the annual sale of these two articles amounts to about twelve hundred pounds.</P>
<P>THIS clay is of a deep ash color; is found in beds of a great thickness; and is dug up in hard lumps, resembling a shaley rock; after which it is left for a considerable time exposed to the air, in order to effect its dissolution. The bricks made with it are set in the lead-furnaces with the unburnt clay, instead of mortar.</P>
<P>I must not leave the parish of <HI>Northop</HI> without visiting the maritime parts, which stretch along the channel of the <HI>Dee.</HI> We find there the names of certain townships taken notice of in Doomsday book; <HI>Lead-brook, Normanized</HI> into <HI>Lathroc,</HI> from the <HI>Anglo-Saxon, Laed,</HI> and <HI>Broca</HI> either from the quantity of lead washed out of it, or from the smelting-works established on it. This township, after the Conquest, was held by <HI>Robert</HI> of <HI>Rudland.</HI></P>
<P>ULFMILTONE was another, now known by the name of <HI>Golf∣tyn.</HI></P>
<P>WEPRE, another township, was held by <HI>William de Malbedeng,</HI> from the church of <HI>Chester.</HI> It is twice mentioned in Doomsday book; and is said to have had on it a wood a league and a half long. In one place mention is made of two villeyns and two boors: in another, of one villeyn and a <HI>radman;</HI> and that it had been possessed by one <HI>Ernui,</HI> a freeman. Of late years, a very handsome pier has been built by the river <HI>Dee</HI> company in this township, jutting into the channel, for the protection of
<PB N="89" REF="107"/>
the ships bound to or from <HI>Chester,</HI> under which they may take shelter in bad weather or adverse winds.</P>
<P>FROM hence I ascended to <HI>Hawarden,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">HAWARDEN.</NOTE> a small town, flourishing under the auspices of its lord, Sir <HI>John Glynne</HI> baronet. I shall speak first of the manor and castle. The last forms a most picturesque object, soaring above the woods. This place, like most others in our county, bears two names, <HI>Pennard halawg,</HI> perhaps corrupted from <HI>Pen y Llŵch,</HI> or <HI>the head land above the lake; Saltney,</HI> and the other subjacent marshes having once been covered by the sea. The other name is <HI>Saxon,</HI> as we find it written in Doomsday book, <HI>Haordine;</HI> at which time it was a lordship; had a church, two <HI>Carucae</HI> or ploughlands, half of one belonging to the latter; half an acre of meadow; a wood two leagues long and half a league broad. The whole was valued at forty shillings; yet on all this were but four vil∣leyns, six boors, and four slaves: so low was the state of popu∣lation.</P>
<P>IT is probable,<NOTE PLACE="marg">ROMAN</NOTE> that this place had been a <HI>British</HI> post, opposed to the country of the <HI>Cornavii,</HI> and to the invading <HI>Romans.</HI> To the west of the church, in a field adjoining to the road, is a mount called <HI>Truman</HI>'s hill, within a piece of ground which appears to have been squared, and nicely sloped. This evi∣dently had been a small camp, whose figure has been much obliterated by the frequency of agriculture. It stood on the brow of the hill, and commanded a full view of the country. Another mount, called <HI>Conna's. Hê,</HI> is to be seen near Broad∣lane house. The Rost, an eminence (overlooking another flat) with fosses, and an exploratory mount, lying in the parish of

<HI>Gresford,</HI> was another; and at <HI>Caer-Estyn,</HI> a fourth. We shall find occasion to speak more of these in the course of our journey.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Saxons</HI> possessed themselves of every strong hold which the <HI>Britons</HI> or the <HI>Romans</HI> had deserted.<NOTE PLACE="marg">SAXON.</NOTE> Some they retained, others they neglected, as the policy of the new invaders, and the necessity of the situation, required. This, before the Conquest, was a chief manor, and the capital one of the hundred of <HI>Atiscross.</HI> On the invasion of <HI>William,</HI> it was found in the possession of the gal∣lant <HI>Edwin,</HI> and probably was one of the places of his residence. It was a cover to his <HI>Mercian</HI> dominions against the <HI>Britons,</HI> the natural and inveterate enemies of the <HI>Saxon</HI> race.</P>
<P>ON the Conquest,<NOTE PLACE="marg">NORMAN.</NOTE> it was comprehended in the vast grant made to <HI>Hugh Lupus.</HI> It afterwards devolved to the barons of <HI>Mont-alto,</HI> or <HI>Mold,</HI> which they held by stewartship to the earls of <HI>Chester,</HI> and made it their residence<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cambden, ii. 826.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>GENEALOGISTS<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Collin</HI>'s Peerage, i. 48.</NOTE> tell us, that <HI>Roger Fitz-valerine,</HI> son of one of the noble adventurers who followed the fortunes of <HI>William</HI> the conqueror, possessed this castle; and having frequent con∣tests with the <HI>Welsh,</HI> often saved himself by retreating to it; and from that circumstance it was called <HI>Howard's Den.</HI> But, with high respect to all the blood of all the <HI>Howards,</HI> it does not appear that their name was then known: with more probabi∣lity does their historian say, that <HI>William,</HI> the son of <HI>Fitz-vale-rine,</HI> received the addition of <HI>de Haward</HI> or <HI>Howard,</HI> from the accident of being born in this place.</P>

Hist. xxii, 384.</NOTE>. This induced <HI>Glynne</HI> to make an offer to the earl, of the surrender of <HI>Hawarden,</HI> for a lease of three lives<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Account communicated to me by Sir <HI>John Glynne.</HI></NOTE>. The proposal was either rejected, or not imme∣diately accepted: the consequence of which was, the loss of the whole to the <HI>Derby</HI> family. The Lords, resentful of the indigni∣ties their order had experienced in the late troubles, began with an attempt to obtain reparation to one of the greatest sufferers. In the <HI>December</HI> of the same year, they sent down to the Com∣mons a private bill, for the restoring to <HI>Charles</HI> earl of <HI>Derby,</HI> all the manors, lands, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which belonged to his late father. This was strongly opposed; and the bill was laid aside, without<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Drake, xxiii. 50.<PB N="96" REF="114"/></NOTE>
ever coming to a second reading<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Drake, xxiii. 53.</NOTE>. The earl was then glad to compound with the serjeant for the property of this place, and granted it to him and his heirs; in whom it still remains.</P>
<P>IT appears by these proceedings, as if the parlement was fearful of the consequences of even an act of justice; for, during the long troubles, there had been such vast change of property, effected by fuch variety of means, that it was apprehended, that the enquiry into the causes, and the dispossession of numbers who had quietly enjoyed such property from their fathers, might be attended with the most inflammatory consequences. It is likewise probable, that many of the members might be interested in the event; therefore, were determined to stop at once any proceeding that might tend to affect the fortunes of themselves or friends. Numbers of sales were made by the loyalists them∣selves, under the influence of fear. They were content to receive a trifle for the purchase, rather than lose the whole by violence; for there were very few who had not incurred a premunire under the ruling powers; which they were glad to get clear of by a seemingly voluntary sale. When they were thus disappointed in the hope of re-enjoyment of their fortunes, they laid the blame on the king, and invented the calumny of his rejecting this bill, after it had been passed unanimously by both houses.</P>

<P>ALL this eloquence would have been flung away, had not more forces on the side of the king, and want of provisions on that of the garrison, co-operated with this valiant epistle. So, as <HI>Rushworth</HI> says, <Q>after a fortnight's siege, and much ink and little blood spilt, the castle being in want of provisions, was surrendered to Sir <HI>Michael Earnley,</HI> on condition to march out with half arms and two pair of colors, one flying, and the other furled; and to have a convoy to <HI>Wem</HI> or <HI>Nantwyche.</HI></Q></P>

At that time Sir <HI>William Neal</HI> was governor, who declined to give it up till he had obtained his majesty's permission<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">MS. at <HI>Mostyn</HI></NOTE>. On the 22d of <HI>December</HI> it was by vote of parlement ordered to be dismantled,<NOTE PLACE="marg">DISMANTLED.</NOTE> with four other castles in this part of <HI>North Wales.</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Whitelock, 231.</NOTE> These orders extended only to the rendering it unte∣nable; but the farther destruction was effected by the owner, Sir <HI>William Glynne,</HI> the first baronet of the name, between the years 1665 and 1678.</P>
<P>THE remains are a fine circular tower or keep,<NOTE PLACE="marg">DESCRIBED.</NOTE> on the summit of a mount. This alone is pretty entire. Nothing except this,
<PB N="100" REF="118"/>
and a few walls, and the foundations of some rooms, exist at pre∣sent; which Sir <HI>John Glynne</HI> has, with great pains, laid open by the removal of the rubbish. In one place was discovered a long flight of steps, at the bottom of which was a door, and for∣merly a draw-bridge, which crossed a deep long chasm (nicely faced with freestone) to another door leading to two or three small rooms. Probably they were places of confinement, where pri∣soners might be lodged with the utmost security, after pulling up the bridge over the deep chasm that intervened between them and open day.</P>
<P>THE several parts of this fortress seem to have been built at different times. It is surrounded with deep fosses, now filled with trees. In 1665, the timber of the park and demesne was valued at five thousand pounds, and was sold in that century; but the present owner will have the merit of restoring it many∣fold to the next, by the vast plantations he has made.</P>
<P>THE living is in the gift of the lord; who presents;<NOTE PLACE="marg">RECTORY.</NOTE> and the bishop of <HI>Chester</HI> inducts. The rector does all episcopal acts, ex∣cept those of ordination and confirmation; and has a peculiar exempt jurisdiction: grants licences, registers and proves wills; and has his court and his proctors.</P>
<P>THE living is at present eleven hundred pounds a year; and, in proportion as the subjacent lands are cultivated, will experi∣ence a far greater improvement.</P>
<P>THE church is a plain but handsome building, kept in neat and decent repair. The parsonage-house is new, and suitable to the revenue. The garden is very prettily layed out, upon a high and commanding ground.</P>

school was that of the college at <HI>Westminster;</HI> his academic learning was instilled into him at <HI>Hart-ball, Oxford;</HI> and his knowlege of the law at <HI>Lincoln's-Inn,</HI> where he became a bencher. His abilities were immediately discovered by the popular party, by whose in∣fluence he was made steward of <HI>Westminster,</HI> recorder of <HI>London,</HI> and twice elected member for the former, in the two parlements of 1640. He was, next to <HI>Pym,</HI> the most active manager against the earl of <HI>Strafford.</HI> The unfortunate peer remarked, that <HI>Glynne</HI> and <HI>Maynard</HI> treated him like advocates; <HI>Palmer</HI> and <HI>Whitelock</HI> like gentlemen; and yet omitted nothing material that could be urged against him<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Whitelock, 49</NOTE>.

<P>IN the case of <HI>Strafford,</HI> and in that of the impeachment of the twelve bishops, they acted on principle. This appears evident from the prosecution they afterwards underwent, for the noble stand they made against the ruin of the constitution, planned, and afterwards effected by the army. On <HI>September</HI> the 8th 1647, they were expelled the house, committed to the Tower, and had a charge of high-treason brought against them<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Parliament.

<P><PB N="103" REF="123"/>commissioners for carrying on the treaty with the king in the isle of <HI>Wight;</HI> and voted by the house to be a serjeant at law in the new call it thought fit to make. He, as well as the artful <HI>Whitelock,</HI> evaded all concern in trial of the king: but after∣wards temporized fully with the powers in being. <HI>Cromwel</HI> soon made him one of his council. In 1654, he was constituted cham∣berlain of <HI>Chester:</HI> in the following year, was (on the refusal of the chief justice <HI>Rolles</HI>) sent into the west with a commission to try colonel <HI>Penruddock,</HI> and the other insurgents<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Athenae Oxon. ii. 386.</NOTE>. <HI>Rolles</HI> lost his place for his scruples; and in his room the serjeant was re∣warded with the office of lord chief justice of the upper bench. He was grateful to his patron; for, being appointed of the committee to receive the protector's scruples about being made king, he urged the acceptance with the utmost zeal. It is amusing to compare the change of sentiment, from the year 1648, when the kingly office was voted to be unnecessary, burthensome, and dangerous, with the opinion of 1657, when the learned serjeant tells <HI>Cromwel,</HI> that it is essential to the settlement of the nation<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Parliament Hist. xxi. 90.</NOTE>. Notwithstanding the usurper did not dare to assume the name, he mimicked the powers; and honored his advocate with calling him up by writ into his house of peers; that motley assembly of the year 1657. The prudent lawyer maintained his ground till the year of the restoration, when, by a master-piece of cunning, he published in octavo, the arguments he had used to prevale with his former master to mount the throne, under the title of MONARCHY <HI>asserted to be the best, the most antient, and</HI>

legal form of government. How flattering must this have been to the rightful prince, to find the antient mode acknowleged as most eligible (even after the long abuse of it in his family) by one of the ablest supporters of the protectorate?</P>
<P>WHETHER this recommended him to the new government, or whether he had made his peace before, is not certain. He was received by <HI>Charles</HI> with distinguished marks of favor, who not only knighted him, but bestowed on him the honor of prime ser∣jeant, and even created his eldest son a baronet. In the convention parlement, he was elected for the county of <HI>Caer∣narvon;</HI> and was appointed one of the committee for examining the acts passed during the late usurpation, which were inconsist∣ent with the present government; and how the many fines, reco∣veries, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> made in the late courts of law, might be confirmed and rendered good. He had likewise a concern in the act of general pardon, and in all others in which the assistance of an able lawyer was requisite<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Drake's</HI> Parlem.

<P>He retired from the house in the following parlement; and lived till the year 1666, when he died in <HI>London,</HI> and was inter∣red in his own vault, beneath the altar of St. <HI>Margaret</HI>'s church, <HI>Westminster</HI></P>

This tract was formerly granted, by <HI>Robert</HI> lord of <HI>Mold,</HI> to the monks of <HI>Basingwerk,</HI> for pasturage; he also gave them the same privilege in <HI>Hawarden,</HI> and the liberty of cutting rushes for thatching their buildings<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Harleian</HI> MS.

<P>THE form of the city evinces the origin to have been <HI>Roman,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">FOURS CHIEF STREETS.</NOTE> being in the figure of their camps; with four gates; four prin∣cipal streets; and variety of lesser, crossing the others at right angles, dividing the whole into lesser squares. The walls, the precincts of the present city, mark the limits of the antient. No part of the old walls exist; but they stood, like the modern, on the soft freestone rock, high above the circumjacent country, and <HI>escarpe</HI> on every front.</P>
<P>THE structure of the four principal streets is without parallel. They run direct from east to west, and north to south; and were excavated out of the earth, and sunk many feet beneath the surface.<NOTE PLACE="marg">EXCAVATED</NOTE> The carriages are driven far below the level of the kitchens, on a line with ranges or shops; over which, on each side of the streets, passengers walk from end to end, se∣cure from wet or heat, in galleries (or <HI>rowe,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></NOTE> as they are called) purloined from the first floor of each house, open in front and balustraded. The back-courts of all these houses are level with the rows; but to go into any of these four streets, it is ne∣cessary to descend a flight of several steps.</P>
<P>THESE rows appear to me to have been the same with the antient <HI>vestibules;</HI> and to have been a form of building preserved from the time that the city was possessed by the <HI>Romans.</HI> They were built before the doors, midway between the streets and the
<PB N="109" REF="129"/>
houses; and were the places where dependents waited for the coming out of their patrons<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">De signif. vocab. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</NOTE>, and under which they might walk away the tedious minutes of expectation. <HI>Plautus,</HI> in the third act of his <HI>Mostella,</HI> describes both their situation and use:</P>
<Q>Viden' vestibulum ante aedes, et ambulacrum ejusmodi?</Q>
<P>The shops beneath the rows were the <HI>cryptae</HI> and <HI>apothecae,</HI> ma∣gazines for the various necessaries of the owners of the Houses.</P>
<P>The streets were once considerably deeper, as is apparent from the shops, whose floors lie far below the present pavement. In digging foundations for houses, the <HI>Roman</HI> pavement is often dis∣covered at the depth of four feet beneath the modern. The lesser streets and allies, which run into the principal streets, sloped to the bottoms of the latter, as is particularly visible in were <HI>Bridge Street;</HI> but these are destiture of the galleries or rows.</P>
<P>IT is difficult to assign a reason for these hollowed ways.<NOTE PLACE="marg">GREAT VAULTS,</NOTE> An antient historian mentions the existence, in his days, of certain vaults and passages, of which not a trace, nor even the lest memory is left, notwithstanding the most diligent search and enquiries have been made. <HI>In this cyte,</HI> says the author of the <HI>Poly∣chronicen, ben ways under erthe, with vowtes and stone werke wonder∣ly wrought; thre chambred werkes.

A few years ago it was pulled down, on account of its straitness and inconveniency, to give way to a magnifi∣cent gate, which rose in its place by the munificence of lord <HI>Grosvenor.</HI> I remember the demolition of the antient structure; and on the taking down the more modern case of <HI>Norman</HI> ma∣sonry, the <HI>Roman</HI> appeared full in view.</P>
<P>IT consisted of two arches, formed of vast stones, fronting the <HI>East-gate</HI> street and the <HI>Forest</HI> street: the pillar between them dividing the street exactly in two. The accurate repre∣sentation</P>
<P><PB REF="131"/><FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P><PB N="111" REF="132"/>of them by Mr. <HI>Wilkinson,</HI> of this city, will give a stronger idea of them than words can convey; as also of the figure of the <HI>Roman</HI> soldier, placed between the tops of the arches facing the <HI>Forest</HI> street.</P>
<P>THIS species of double gate was not unfrequent. The <HI>Porta esquilina</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Montfaucon,</HI> III. part ii. p. 177.</NOTE>, and the <HI>Porte portese</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Nardini, Roma Anticha, p. 37.</NOTE> at <HI>Rome,</HI> were of this kind. <HI>Flores,</HI> in his medals of the <HI>Roman</HI> colonies in <HI>Spain</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">P. 384. tab. xxi.xxii.xxiii.</NOTE>, exhibits one on the coins of <HI>Merida,</HI> the antient <HI>Emerita,</HI> particularly on those of <HI>Augustus;</HI> which shews, that the colonists were proud of their gate; and perhaps not without reason, as it appears to have been the work of the best age. I must conclude, that the mode seems to have been derived from the <HI>Grecian</HI> architec∣ture; for at <HI>Athens</HI> stood a <HI>Dipylon,</HI> or double gate, now demo∣lished<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">As I have been informed by my friend Mr. <HI>Stuart.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE gate in question faced the great <HI>Watling street road,</HI> and near the place where other military ways united. Through this was the greatest conflux of people; which rendered the use of the double portal more requisite.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Roman</HI> bath beneath the <HI>Feathers Inn,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">HYPOCY</NOTE> in <HI>Bridge street,</HI> is probably still entire; but the only part which can be seen, by reason of the more modern superstructures, is the <HI>Hypocaust.</HI> This is of a rectangular figure, supported by thirty-two pillars, two feet ten inches and a half high, and about eighteen inches distant from each other. Upon each is a tile eighteen inches
<PB N="112" REF="133"/>
square, as if designed for a capital; and over them a perforated tile two feet square. Such are continued over all the pillars. Above these are two layers; one of coarse mortar, mixed with small red gravel, about three inches thick; and the other of finer materials, between four and five inches thick: these seem to have been the floor of the room above. The pillars stand on a mortar-floor, spread over the rock. On the south side, between the middle pillars, is the vent for the smoke, about six inches square, which is at present open to the height of sixteen inches. Here is also an anti-chamber, exactly of the same extent with the <HI>Hypocaust,</HI> with an opening in the middle into it. This is sunk near two feet below the level of the former, and is of the same rectangular figure; so that both together are an exact square. This was the room allotted for the slaves who attended to heat the place; the other was the receptacle of the fuel de∣signed to heat the room above, the <HI>concamerata sudatio</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vitruvius,</HI> lib. v. c. II.</NOTE>, or sweating-chamber; where people were seated, either in niches, or on benches placed one above the other, during the time of the operation. Such was the object of this Hypocaust; for there were others of different forms, for the purposes of heating the waters destined for the use of the bathers.</P>
<P>I MUST now descend towards the bridge, in search of the few further reliques of the antient colonists. After passing through the gate, on the right, near some skinners houses, is a small flight of steps, which lead to a large round arch, seemingly of <HI>Roman</HI> workmanship. It is now filled with more modern ma∣sonry,
<PB N="113" REF="134"/>
and a passage left through a small arch of a very eccentric form.<NOTE PLACE="marg">ANTIENT POS∣TERN.</NOTE> On the left, within the very passage, is the appearance of another round arch, now filled up. This postern is called the <HI>Ship-gate,</HI> or <HI>Hole in the Wall.</HI></P>
<P>THIS seems originally designed for the common passage over the <HI>Dee,</HI> into the country of the <HI>Ordovices,</HI> either by means of a boat at high-water, or by fording at low, the river here being re∣markably shallow. What reduces this to a certainty is, that the rock on the <HI>Hanbridge</HI> side is cut down, as if for the conveniency of travellers. And immediately beyond, in the field called <HI>Ed∣gar</HI>'s, are the vestiges of a road pointing up the hill;<NOTE PLACE="marg">ROMAN ROAD.</NOTE> and which we shall have hereafter occasion to say, was continued toward <HI>bonium,</HI> the present <HI>Bangor.</HI></P>
<P>IN a front of a rock in the same field, and facing this relique of the <HI>Roman</HI> road, is cut a rude figure of the <HI>Dea armigera,</HI> MINERVA with her bird and altar.<NOTE PLACE="marg">SCULPTURE OR MINERVA.</NOTE> This probably was a se∣pulchral monument; for such were very usual on the sides of highways; but time or wantonness has erased all inscription.</P>
<P>BEYOND this stood, past all memory, some antient buildings, whose site is marked by certain hollows; for the ground (pro∣bably over the vaults) gave way and fell in within the remem∣brance of persons now alive. Tradition calls the spot the site of the palace of <HI>Edgar.</HI> Nothing is now left, from which any judgment can be formed, whether it had been a <HI>Roman</HI> build∣ing, as Doctor <HI>Stukeley</HI> surmises; or <HI>Saxon,</HI> according to the pre∣sent notion; or <HI>Norman,</HI> according to <HI>Braun</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Civitates Ortis,</HI> iii. pl. 3. This work was published in 1576.</NOTE>, who, in his antient
<PB N="114" REF="135"/>
plan of this city, styles the ruins, then actually existing, <HI>Ruinosa domus Comitis Cestriensis.</HI> Perhaps it might have been used succes∣sively by every one; who added or improved according to their respective national modes.</P>
<P>HAVING had occasion to mention the name of a departed an∣tiquary, I think fit to acknowlege my obligations for the many hints I have benefitted by, from the travels of that great and lively genius; but at the same time lament, that I must say, I often find him <HI>Plus beau que la</HI> VERITE. His rapid fancy led him too frequently to paint things as he thought they ought to be, not what they really were. In the subject before us, this asser∣tion may be supported, by his giving three arches to the antient <HI>East gate,</HI> and hollow ways to every part of the city; where search, has been made.</P>
<P>THE beautiful altar,<NOTE PLACE="marg">ALTAR.</NOTE> in possession of Mr. <HI>Dyson,</HI> and the soldier in the garden or Mr. <HI>Lawton,</HI> are the only pieces of detached antiquities now ramaining in this city. The first is of great elegance, and was erected by <HI>Flavius Longus,</HI> tribune of the twentieth victorious legion, and his son <HI>Longinus,</HI> in honor of the emperors <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and <HI>Maximian.</HI> The father and son, who thus expressed their gratitude, were of <HI>Samosata,</HI> a city of <HI>Syria</HI> On one side is the inscription, on the opposite is a cur∣tain with a festoon above. On one of the narrower sides is a genius with a <HI>cornucopia;</HI> and on the other is a pot with a plant of the supposed <HI>acanthus,</HI> elegantly leaved. On the summit is a head included in a circular garland. I fogot to remark, that immediately over the inscription is a globe overtopped with palm-leaves. If this is not a general compliment to their
<PB N="115" REF="136"/>
victories, I should imagine it designed to express their particu∣lar successes in <HI>Africa,</HI> of which the palm-tree was a known emblem.</P>
<P>THIS was found in digging for a cellar near the <HI>East-gate,</HI> on the antient pavement, which consisted of great stones. Around it were found the marks of sacrifice; heads, horns, and bones of the ox, roe-buck, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and with them two coins; one of <HI>Vespasian</HI> in brass, with his head, inscribed IMP. CAES. VESP. AUG. COSS. III. and on the reverse, VICTORIA AUGUSTI S. C. and a winged Victory standing. The other was of copper, in∣scribed round the head, of <HI>Constantius,</HI> FL. VAL. CONSTANTIUS NOB. C. and on the other side, GENIO POPULI ROMANI; allud∣ing to a genius holding in one hand a sacrificing bowl, in the other a <HI>cornucopia.</HI></P>
<P>THE other antiquities discovered here are now dispersed; which obliges me to have recourse to books, in order to place them in one point of view.</P>
<P>THE first is the noted altar discovered in 1653,<NOTE PLACE="marg">ANOTHER.</NOTE> at present preserved at <HI>Oxford.</HI> It is inscribed to <HI>Jupiter,</HI> with the <HI>British</HI> epithet <HI>Tanarus,</HI> or the Thunderer, by the transposal of the let∣ters <HI>r</HI> and <HI>n</HI> in the word <HI>Taran.</HI> This appears to have been complimentary to the <HI>Britons,</HI> by adopting the epithet in their language, instead of that of <HI>Tonans.</HI> The inscription (approved most by Mr. <HI>Horsely</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tab, 67. N<SUP>o</SUP> iii.</NOTE>) runs thus:</P>
<Q><PB N="116" REF="137"/>

<P>THE word <HI>Guntic,</HI> in the learned <HI>Prideaux</HI> and <HI>Gale</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gale's Comm. 53.</NOTE>, is read <HI>Gunethae,</HI> as if derived from <HI>Gwinedd,</HI> one of the <HI>British</HI> names of <HI>North Wales;</HI> over which they suppose <HI>Elupius</HI> had presided. This might account for his preference of the word <HI>Tanaro,</HI> as highly flattering to the vanity of those he governed.</P>
<P>THE next is a statue in possession of the late Reverend Mr. <HI>Prescot,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">STATUE or MI∣THRAS.</NOTE> with a <HI>Phrygian</HI> bonnet on his head, a little mantle cross his shoulders, and a short jacket on his body. He is placed standing with a torch in his hands declining. This is supposed to have been <HI>Mithras,</HI> or the sun; a deity borrowed from the <HI>Persians,</HI> and much in vogue among the <HI>Romans</HI> in the second and third century<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Horsely, Cumberland, 259.</NOTE>. An inscription, DEO SOLI MITRAE, has been discovered in <HI>Cumberland.</HI> The <HI>Phrygian</HI> bonnet marks him for a foreign deity. The declining torch shews the fune∣brious occasion of this stone.</P>
<P>MR. HORSELY mentions another stone, discovered in digging a cellar in <HI>Water-gate street,</HI> in 1729. The inscription is so im∣perfect, that he ingenuously confesses, that without the aid of fancy, it cannot be made out.</P>
<P><PB N="117" REF="138"/>A FEW bricks, with the number of the legion stationed here, fill the list of the <HI>Roman</HI> antiquities of the place. I say nothing of the inscription DEAE NYMPHAE BRIGANTES, preserved by Mr. <HI>Gale,</HI> it being justly disputed whether it belonged to this place.</P>
<P>I MUST not omit the most valuable memorial which the <HI>Ro∣mans</HI> left,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHEESE-MAKING.</NOTE> in a particular manner, to this county; the art of cheese-making: for we are expressly told, that the <HI>Britons</HI> were ignorant of it till the arrival of the <HI>Romans.</HI> The <HI>Cestrians</HI> have improved so highly in this article, as to excel all coun∣tries, not excepting that of <HI>Italy,</HI> the land of their antient masters.</P>
<P>THE twentieth legion was recalled from <HI>Britain</HI> before the writing of the <HI>Notitia,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">THE LEGION QUITS THIS STA∣TION</NOTE> it not being mentioned in that work, which was composed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Horsely, 473.</NOTE> about the year 445.

The city must not at that period be supposed to be totally deserted; it remained oc∣cupied by the descendants of the legionaries, who partook of the same privileges, and were probably a numerous body. Num∣bers likewise, who had married with the native islanders, and embraced civil employs, in all likelihood stayed behind after the final abdication of <HI>Britain</HI> by the legions in 448. After this, the city fell under the government of the <HI>Britons,</HI> till their conquest was entirely effected by the new invaders the <HI>Saxons.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="139"/>BRITAIN,<NOTE PLACE="marg">SAXON PERIOD.</NOTE> now left defenceless, quickly experienced all the calamities that could be inflicted on it from a oreign and bar∣barous people. While <HI>Hengist</HI> and <HI>Horsa</HI> poured in their troop<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> upon the south, another set of <HI>Banaitli</HI> landed in <HI>Wales,</HI> from their settlements in the <HI>Orcades</HI> and the north of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tland.</HI> These with their allies the <HI>Picts,</HI> were defeated near <HI>Mold,</HI> by the Christian <HI>Britons.</HI> headed by St. <HI>Germanus.</HI> I mention this out of course, merely to shew, that the probable rest that <HI>Deva</HI> enjoyed for another century, was owing to this victory, which, obtained seemingly in a miraculous manner, discouraged for a long space any new attempts.</P>
<P>THE fate of this city was at length decided in 607<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sax. Chren. 25.</NOTE>,<NOTE PLACE="marg">ETHELFRID, 607.</NOTE> when <HI>Ethelfrid</HI> king of <HI>Northumbria</HI> resolved to add this rich tract to his dominions.

He made an easy conquest of <HI>Brochmail,</HI> who, as the <HI>Saxon</HI> chronicle<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">P. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></NOTE> informs us, escaped with about fifty men.

<P><PB N="119" REF="140"/>WE are left unacquainted with the history of this city for a long period. The <HI>Britons</HI> seem to have continued in possession of it, and it was considered to be the capital city of <HI>Venedotia,</HI> or <HI>North Wales,</HI> till it was finally wrested out of their hands by <HI>Egbert,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">EGBERT, 828.</NOTE> about the year 828, during the reign of the <HI>British</HI> prince <HI>Mervyn</HI> and his wife <HI>Esylht</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Powel, 27.</NOTE>; which contracted the limits of <HI>Wales,</HI> during the remainder of its independent existence.</P>

They seized on <HI>Legaceaster</HI> before the king could overtake them.

<P>IN the following century, the invasions of the <HI>Danes</HI> were conducted with so much policy as to induce the factious and traiterous nobility of <HI>England</HI> to rise and favor their designs. <HI>Edmund,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">EDMUND IRON∣SIDES.</NOTE> surnamed <HI>Ironside,</HI> took arms to relieve his distressed country, and carried the war into the northern counties, among which lay the principal partizans of the invaders: whose country he ravaged, in resentment of their treason.

<P>ON the restoring of the <HI>Saxon</HI> line, it reverted, with the rest of the <HI>Mercian</HI> province, to its old masters. <HI>Leofric,</HI> a munifi∣cent nobleman, was at that time governor of <HI>Mercia,</HI> and earl of <HI>Chester.</HI> These earls were not created, but merely official.

earl,<NOTE PLACE="marg">POST-CONQUEST EARLS OF CHES∣TER</NOTE> and ruled by what was called, in the <HI>Saxon</HI> phrase, the <HI>Merchenlege,</HI> received in many cases a distinct master. <HI>Cheshire</HI> fell to the share of <HI>Gherbod,</HI> a valiant <HI>Fleming.</HI> By misfortune he fell into the hands of his enemies (being called into <HI>Flanders</HI>) soon after he had taken possession of his new territories, and by reason of a long captivity was obliged to resign them to ano∣ther. The Conqueror, in his place, appointed <HI>Hugh de Aurange,</HI> better known by the name of <HI>Hugh Lupus;</HI> the first <HI>Norman</HI> earl of <HI>Chester</HI> who ever possessed the county. To him he dele∣gated a fulness of power; made his a <HI>county palatine,</HI> and gave it such a sovereign jurisdiction, that the antient earls kept their own parlements; and had their own courts of law, in which any offence against the dignity of the sword of <HI>Chester</HI> was as cognizable here, as the like offence would have been at <HI>Westminster</HI> against the dignity of the royal crown; for <HI>William</HI> allowed <HI>Lupus</HI> to hold this county <HI>tam liberè ad gladium, sicut ipse</HI> REX <HI>tenebat</HI> Angliam <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d coronam.</HI> The sword by which he was invested with this dignity is still to be seen in the <HI>Museum,</HI> inscribed <HI>Hugo comes Cestriae.</HI> Another inferior office was also held by the earls, by virtue of this sword; that of sword-bearer of <HI>England</HI> at the times of coronation<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Leicester, 105.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>LUP<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>S instantly took possession of his dominions. It is probable that he was invested in them by <HI>William</HI> himself; for we find the Conqueror at <HI>Chester</HI> in person in 1069, where he repelled the <HI>Welsh,</HI> and finally reduced the <HI>Mercian</HI> province, which appears to have been in arms to this period<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ordericus vitalis, lib. iv. p. 516.</NOTE>. At the same time restored
<PB N="125" REF="146"/>
the walls and built the castle; the former having either fallen into decay since the days of <HI>Ethelfreda,</HI> or were not thought suffi∣ciently strong for the exigencies of the times.</P>
<P>As soon as <HI>Lupus</HI> was firmly established, he began to exert his regal prerogatives. He formed his parlement by the crea∣tion of eight barons, <HI>viz. Nigel</HI> baron of <HI>Halton; Robert,</HI> of <HI>Montalt; William Malbedeng</HI> baron of <HI>Nantwich; Vernon,</HI> of <HI>Shipbrook; Fitzhugh,</HI> of <HI>Malpas; Hamon de Massie Venables,</HI> of <HI>Kinderton;</HI> and <HI>Nicholas,</HI> of <HI>Stockport.</HI> These were to assist the earl with their advice: <HI>Ego comes</HI> HUGO <HI>et mei</HI> BARONES, was the form of his writs. They were obliged to pay him attend∣ance, and to repair to his court to give it the greater dignity. They were bound, in time of war with <HI>Wales,</HI> to find for every knight's-fee a horse with caparison and furniture, or two with∣out furniture, in the division of <HI>Cheshire.</HI> Their knights and freeholders were to have corselets and habergeons, and were to defend their lands with their own bodies. Every baron had also four esquires; every esquire one gentleman; and every gen∣tleman one valet<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Erdeswicke</HI>'s MSS. quoted by Doctor <HI>Gower,</HI> p. 22.</NOTE>. Each of these barons had also their free courts of all pleas and suits, and all plaints, except what be∣longed to the earl's <HI>sword.</HI> They had besides power of life and death. The last instance of the exertion of this power was in the person of <HI>Hugh Stringer,</HI> who was tried for murder in the baron of <HI>Kinderton</HI>'s court, and executed in 1597<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Doctor <HI>Gower</HI>'s materials, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> p. 22.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE earls had their chamberlain, which supplied the place of chancellor; an office continued to this day. The first we
<PB N="126" REF="147"/>
know of was <HI>Philippus Camerarius,</HI> who took his name from his office, in the time of <HI>Randle Gernouns</HI> earl of <HI>Chester.</HI> Here is a baron of the exchequer, and other officers conformable to those of the crown at <HI>Westminster:</HI> also justices, before whom the causes which of their nature should otherwise belong respectively to the courts of king's-bench and common-pleas, are triable<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Leicester, 152.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IN imitation of regal power, the earls appointed a high con∣stable of <HI>Cheshire,</HI> correspondent to the high constable of <HI>Eng∣land;</HI> which was held in fee by the baron of <HI>Halton,</HI> who by virtue of this office took place of the other barons; and the baron of <HI>Montalt</HI> had precedency (after him) by virtue of his office in fee, of high steward.</P>
<P>ROBERT DE ROTHELENT was another baron, who was com∣mander in chief of the forces in <HI>Cheshire,</HI> and prime governor of the county under his cousin <HI>Hugh Lupus.</HI> As his office and rank dropt with him, he is not reckoned among the barons. Probably the office was found unnecessary, and clashing with the priveleges of the high constable.</P>
<P>THIS species of government continued from the Conquest till the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> III. a period of about 174 years; when, in 1237, on the death of <HI>John Scot</HI> (the seventh earl of the <HI>Norman</HI> line) without issue male, <HI>Henry</HI> took the earldom into his own hands, and gave the daughters of the late earl other lands in lieu; unwilling, as we said, that so great an inheritance should <HI>be parcelled out among distaffs.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">THE EARLDOM RESUMED BY THE CROWN.</NOTE> The king bestowed the coun∣ty
<PB N="127" REF="148"/>
on his son <HI>Edward,</HI> who did not assume the title; which he afterwards bestowed on his son <HI>Edward</HI> of <HI>Caernarvon,</HI> first <HI>English</HI> prince of <HI>Wales.</HI></P>
<P>AFTER the resumption of the earldom by the crown, the government of the city assumed a new form; for in the year 1242, the 26th of <HI>Henry</HI> III. it appears to have first been under the directions of a mayor and sheriffs. The mayor seems to have been the substitute for the constable; an office which, during the period of the <HI>Norman</HI> earls, was, under them, supreme in all matters military and civil, in both city and county. The sheriffs seem to have been a new name for bailiffs, who acted under the former<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vale royal, 161.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>AFTER giving a general idea of the state of this place and county to the time of <HI>Henry</HI> III. I shall return to the time of <HI>Hugh Lupus,</HI> and give, to the best of my power, a brief chronolo∣gical account of its history; leaving the ecclesiastical part to be treated apart.</P>
<P>IN the days of that potent earl, and probably long before he was possessed of this city, it enjoyed by prescription divers priveleges.<NOTE PLACE="marg">GUILD MIRCA∣TORY.</NOTE> It had a <HI>guild mercatory</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid. 157.</NOTE>, analogous to a modern corporation; so that no person who was not of that society could exercise any trade or carry on any commerce within its pre∣cinct. Such was the state in which the <HI>Normans</HI> found it; which the earls afterwards confirmed under their seals.</P>
<P>Two overseers, selected out of the most respectable citizens, were appointed to maintain the rights of this <HI>guild.</HI> They re∣ceived,
<PB N="128" REF="149"/>
for the use of the city, all the customs paid by strangers, unless at the fairs, which in those days were said to have been held three times in the year. These officers were probably of the same nature as the deans of <HI>guild</HI> in <HI>Scotland.</HI> It appears also from the Doomsday book, that here was a supreme officer, called the <HI>Prapesitus Regis,</HI> or provost, who had the care both of the civil and commercial interests.</P>
<P>IT is difficult to say at this time what were the articles of ex∣portation, excepting slaves and horses.<NOTE PLACE="marg">EXPORTS. SLAVES.</NOTE> The first barbarous traffic was carried on by the <HI>Saxons</HI> to a great height. The de∣scription of the mart is an exact picture of the <HI>negro</HI> commerce<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">THERE is a town called <HI>Brichstou (Bristol)</HI> opposite to <HI>Ireland,</HI> and ex∣tremely convenient for trading with that country. <HI>Wulfstan</HI> induced them to drop a barbarous custom, which neither the love of God nor the king could prevale on them to lay aside. This was the mart for slaves, collected from all parts of <HI>England;</HI> and particularly young women, whom they took care to provide with a pregnancy, in order to enhance their value. It was a most moving sight to see, in the public markets, rows of young people of both sexes tied together with ropes; of great beauty, and in the flower of their youth, daily prossituted, daily sold. Execrable fact! wretched disgrace! Men, un∣mindful even of the affection of the brute creation! delivering into slavery their relations, and even their very offspring. Vita <HI>S.

<P>HORSES were another article;<NOTE PLACE="marg">HORSES, HIDES, &amp;c.</NOTE> but their exportation was pro∣hibited, excepting they were designed for presents, by a law of <HI>Athelstan.</HI> But these, as well as several others, such as metals, hides, dogs, and chalk, were probably still exported, as in the
<PB N="129" REF="150"/>
times of the <HI>Romans. Chester</HI> was, admirably situated for supplying all these articles, excepting the last. The frequent wars carried on with the <HI>Welsh,</HI> furnished them with slaves; if those were wanting, their neighbors of the <HI>Northumbrian</HI> kingdom were ready to dispose of their nearest relations<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Willielm. Malmesh. <HI>in script. post,</HI> Bedam, p. 17.</NOTE>. The rich plains of <HI>Cheshire</HI> furnished horns and hides; and the <HI>Cambrian</HI> mines, lead and copper.</P>
<P>CHEESE must not be omitted,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHEESE.</NOTE> as a most important article; for the <HI>Britons</HI> made so great a progress in the arts of the dairy, that even under the <HI>Roman</HI> reign there was great exportation of cheeses for the use of the <HI>Roman</HI> armies; in which this county doubtlessly had the greatest share.</P>

<P>It is certain that <HI>Chester</HI> had long been a celebrated port. It appears to have been a station for the <HI>Saxon</HI> navy; and fre∣quently the seat of the court of the <HI>Mercian</HI> kingdom, both during the Heptarchy, and after it became a province at the general union under <HI>Egbert.</HI></P>
<P>THE state of this city, in the time of <HI>Edward</HI> the Confessor, and at the Conquest, must be collected from the famous survey the <HI>Doomsday</HI> book.</P>
<P><PB N="131" REF="152"/>IT appears, that in the time of the <HI>Saxon</HI> monarch here were four hundred and thirty-one houses which were taxable, besides fifty-six that belonged to the bishop: that it yielded ten marks of silver and a half; two parts to the king, and the third to the earl: that whenever the king came in person, he clamed from every plough-land two hundred <HI>hesthas,</HI> one <HI>cuna</HI> of ale, and one <HI>rusca</HI> of butter<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Hestha</HI> is supposed to be a capon; <HI>cuna</HI> &amp; brewing tub or vat. I do not find <HI>rusca</HI> explained.</NOTE>: that if any persons made bad ale, they were either to sit in a chair full of dung, or pay four shilings: that there were twelve judges in the city, and seven mint-masters: that whenever repairs were wanting for the walls or the bridge, notice was given for one man out of every hide-land in the county to appear; and in case of absence, he was fined forty shillings, to be divided between the king and the earl: and that the city was so depopulated at the time that <HI>Hugh Lupus</HI> took possession, that there were two hun∣dred and five houses fewer than in the time of the Con∣fessor.</P>
<P>IT is probable that the city soon emerged from its calamities, and felt a considerable increase under its new masters, a more polished race; for the <HI>Normans</HI> affected as much elegance in their dress and their buildings, as they did temperance in their meat and drink. The example of a magnificent warrior, such as the new earl, was quickly copied. His court, and that of his successors, rendered it the most considerable place in these parts.</P>

<P>THESE plays had probably been dropt for a considerable time; which occasioned the proclamation, in the reign of that pageant-loving prince <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. Forty-three years had elapsed since the last performance of this nature, when the <HI>Assumption of our Lady</HI> was played before his brother <HI>Arthur,</HI> at the abby∣gates of this city.</P>
<P>THESE Mysteries were the rude origin of the <HI>English</HI> theatre. Our drama, as the very ingenious Mr. <HI>Warton</HI> remarks, was in early times confined entirely to religious subjects; and these plays were nothing more than an appendage to the specious and mechanical devotion of the age<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">History of <HI>English</HI> Poetry, i, 237.</NOTE>. I refer the reader to that gentleman's amusing history of the rise and progress of these performances; and confine myself to a few specimens of the gross and ridicu∣lous exhibitions of the times; when the audience listened with
<PB N="139" REF="160"/>
the fullest admiration and devotion to what would at present fill a theatre with laughter from the gay, at the absurdity, or scandalize the serious part, with the (unintentional) impiety. I shall only premise, that the scene of action was the church, in defiance of the fulminations of the furious <HI>Bonner,</HI> and the pious <HI>G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>indal.</HI></P>
<P>THESE plays were twenty-five in number. They were per∣formed for above three centuries, to the staring audience; who received the unvaried subject with the same annual pleasure as the <HI>Romans</HI> did the farces in their days of honest simplicity.</P>

<P>They do not appear to us in the words of the original deviser: but, the language and the poetry being grown obsolete, they were altered to that of the time, for the performance of the year 1600, and were acted by the craftsmen of the twenty-five com∣panies, who were all dressed in suitable habits.</P>

<P N="2">2.

<P>She is then welcomed by the devils; which closes the piece, and all I shall relate of those heaps of absurdities.</P>
<P>THE city had,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1542 PUBLIC STEWS.</NOTE> till this time, been indulged with public stews or brothels, which, for some centuries, were permitted by le∣gislative authority, and regulated by wholesome laws, ordained by the commons, and confirmed by the king and lords. hose of <HI>Southwark</HI> were attended to in a particular manner in 1161, the 8th of <HI>Henry</HI> II. One article affords reason to believe, that a certain disease had a much earlier date than the siege of <HI>Naples;</HI> for it prohibits the stew-holders from keeping any wo∣man that hath the <HI>perillous infirmity of burning</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Stow's</HI> Hist. <HI>London,</HI> II. book iv. 7.</NOTE>. Their houses were distinguished by having the fronts whitewashed, by having signs, not hung out, but painted against the walls. Among the signs, I observe the singular one of the cardinal's hat. Notwith∣standing the keepers were protected in their profession, they were reckoned infamous, were not to be impannelled on any juries,
<PB N="146" REF="167"/>
or allowed to hold a tavern<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Drake's</HI> Parlem. Hist. ii. 233.</NOTE>. The women that frequented them were forbidden the rites of the church, as long as they exercised their profession, and were excluded from Christian burial, if they were not reconciled before their death. <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. suppressed the <HI>Surry</HI> houses in 1537; those in this city in 1542.</P>
<P>THIS year was distinguished by one of the cruel deeds that marked the reign of the bigotted <HI>Mary;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1554.</NOTE> the burning of <HI>George Marsh,</HI> for his adherence to the Protestant faith. I have often been informed by the worthy Doctor <HI>William Cooper,</HI> that when <HI>Marsh</HI> was brought to <HI>Boughton,</HI> the place of execution, by the sheriffs <HI>Amory</HI> and <HI>Cooper,</HI> the last, an ancestor of the Doctor; favoring the religion of the sufferer, attempted his rescue; but being overpowered by his brother-officer, was obliged to fly till better times, when he returned, and discharged the office of mayor in 1561.</P>
<P>FESTIVE times now took place again,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1564.</NOTE> probably in compliment to the taste of the glorious but romantic Queen <HI>Elizabeth.</HI> In the year 1564, upon the <HI>Sunday</HI> after Midsummer, in the mayor∣alty of Sir <HI>Lawrence Smith,</HI> <Q>the history of <HI>Aenecs</HI> and queen <HI>Dido</HI> was played on the <HI>Reed's-eye,</HI> set forth by <HI>William Croston,</HI> gent. and Mr. <HI>Man;</HI> on which triumph was made two forts, and shipping on the water, besides many horsemen well armed and appointed.</Q> The forts and shipping seem to have been pageants, to carry on some deeds of chivalry.

<P>THE virtue of <HI>Edward Dutton,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1604.</NOTE> mayor or the city in 1604, must not pass unnoticed. This worthy magistrate, like <HI>Mar∣seilles</HI>' good bishop, kept his station during the whole time of a dreadful pestilence;</P>
<Q>When nature sickened, and each gale was death.</Q>
<P>HIS house was infected, and some of his children and ser∣vants died. The court of exchequer was removed to <HI>Tarvin;</HI>

the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> assizes were held at <HI>Namptwich;</HI> and the fairs ceased during this sad visitation.</P>
<P>IN this year the city was honored with the presence of <HI>James</HI> I. where he was received with a magnificence that did honor to the place.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></NOTE> The mayor. <HI>Edward Button,</HI> presented his majesty with a fair standing cup, with a cover double gilt, and in it a hundred jacobins or gold. He also delivered the city's sword to the king, who returning it, the mayor bore it before him on horseback. His worship was offered the honor of knighthood, but declined it. The city did not confine its munificence to crowned heads; I find, that in 1583, <HI>Robert</HI> earl of <HI>Leicester,</HI> chamberlain of the county palatine, met with a most honorable reception; was received at the high-cross by the whole cor∣poration, entertained by the mayor, and presented with a cup containing forty angels. The unfortunate earl of <HI>Essex,</HI> in 1598, in his way to <HI>Ireland,</HI> was still more distinguished. He was pre∣sented with the like sum; but in a cup of the same kind as that which was afterwards presented to <HI>James.</HI></P>
<P>FROM 1617, I discover nothing very particular for a consi∣derable space; till the city was involved in the calamities of a siege in 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>45-6, in consequence of its unshaken loyalty to <HI>Charles</HI> I. At the beginning of the civil war, immediate attention was paid to this important city, by the royal party. The fortifications were put into the best repair, and outworks extended from the alcove on the north part of the walls, to the brink of the river near <HI>Boughton;</HI> and in consequence, numbers of houses were pulled down, to prevent them from giving shelter to the enemy. The first attempt made on the place by the parlement army was
<PB N="149" REF="170"/>
on the 20th of <HI>July</HI> 1643, when Sir <HI>William Brereton</HI> gave a violent assault on the works; but met with a repulse. In the same year he sent a summons to Sir <HI>Abraham Shipman,</HI> then go∣vernor, to surrender: the gallant commander bid him come and win it and wear it.</P>
<P>AFTER the repulse of Lord <HI>Biron</HI> before <HI>Namptwich,</HI> the county of <HI>Chester</HI> was almost entirely in the hands of Sir <HI>Wil∣liam Brereton,</HI> and the city suffered from that time a sort of blockade, from the quarters the enemy possessed in the neighbor∣hood, even as near as the village of <HI>Christleton.</HI> Sallies and excur∣sions were frequently made; and, according to the diary of the siege with advantage to the loyalists.</P>
<P>ON <HI>September</HI> the 19th 1645, the parlement gained an advan∣tage irrecoverable by the besieged. Colonel <HI>Jones</HI> and adjutant-general <HI>Lothian,</HI> who were employed in the reduction of <HI>Beeston</HI> castle, drew from before that place, in a secret manner, a large body of forces, and in the night stormed the outworks, and made themselves masters of every thing, even to the city walls. His majesty, immediately after this misfortune, passed through <HI>Wales,</HI> and got into the city, in hopes of animating the garrison, and was lodged at Sir <HI>Francis Gamul</HI>'s, near the bridge. He ar∣rived only time enough to be a spectator, from the leads of the <HI>Phoenix</HI> tower, of the fatal battle on <HI>Rowton</HI> heath, on <HI>September</HI> 24; when his forces, under Sir <HI>Marmaduke Langdale,</HI> then on their march to raise the siege, after a well-disputed action, sunk under the superior fortune of general <HI>Pointz.</HI></P>
<P>THE king continued that night in <HI>Chester;</HI> and on quitting it the next day, gave orders to the governor, lord <HI>Biron,</HI> that
<PB N="150" REF="171"/>
in case there was no appearance of relief within eight days, he was to treat of a surrender. The king took the route of <HI>Den-high,</HI> attended to that town by the three respectable citizens, Sir <HI>Francis Gamul,</HI> alderman <HI>Cooper,</HI> and captain <HI>Thropp.</HI> The siege was continued with the utmost vigour by Sir <HI>William Brereton;</HI> notwithstanding which, the gallant garrison held out for twenty weeks, beyond the expectation of every body: and, after having been reduced to live on horses, dogs, and cats, yielded, on the 3d of <HI>February</HI> 1645-6, on terms that did honor to the spirit of the besieged. The city was evacuated by the royalists; and received from the parlement, as governor, colonel <HI>Jones.</HI> But the miseries of the citizens did not terminate with the siege: a dreadful pestilence broke out in 1647: two thousand inhabi∣tants perished, and the city became almost a desert.</P>
<P>IN order to give a further history of the military,<NOTE PLACE="marg">BRIDGE.</NOTE> civil, and ecclesiastical architecture of this antient city, I return to the bridge. This passage was prior to the Conquest; at which pe∣riod it seems to have been either destroyed, or found to be so much out of repair, that I find in <HI>Doomsday book</HI> an or∣der for the provost to summon one man from each hide of land in the county, in order to re-build the bridge and the walls; and, in case of neglect of appearance, the lord of the per∣son so summoned was to forfeit to the king and earl forty shillings.</P>
<P>ACCORDING to a MS. quoted by Mr. <HI>Grose,</HI> it was begun by the great restorer of the city, <HI>Ethelfieda,</HI> and after her death completed by her brother <HI>Edward.</HI> Before that time, the pas∣sage was by a ferry that plied between the postern, called the
<PB N="151" REF="172"/>
<HI>Ship-gate,</HI> and <HI>Edgar</HI>'s field. It does not appear to me that any part of the <HI>Saxon</HI> bridge remains; so frequently has it been re∣paired since that distant period.</P>
<P>BENEATH the arch next to the city,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CAUSEWAY AND MILLS.</NOTE> is a current, which, by means of a great dam or causeway that crosses the river obliquely, supplies the city mills with water. These mills and the cause∣way were originally founded by <HI>Hugh Lupus</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Harleian</HI> MSS. 2082. 10. 2003. 41. 43.</NOTE>, and retained by his successors, and afterwards by the earls of <HI>Chester</HI> of the royal line. I find them often leased by the crown; <HI>Edward</HI> the black prince, in particular, in 1355, grants them, the fishing, suit, court, and calsey, for three years, to <HI>Robert</HI> of <HI>Bredone,</HI> parson of St. <HI>Peter</HI> of <HI>Chester,</HI> and others, at the annual rent of 190 <HI>l.</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Idem, 2081. 21.</NOTE>. This rent was very considerable in those days; and arose from the obligation every inhabitant of the city then lay under to grind at these mills, excepting the tenants of the abbot and monks of St. <HI>Werburgh,</HI> and, in after times, those of the dean and chapter, inhabiting without the <HI>North-gate,</HI> who had a mill of their own at <HI>Bachpool.</HI></P>
<P>I MUST not omit, that a grant of these mills for life was the reward of valor to my countryman Sir <HI>Howel y Fwyall,</HI> for his bravery in taking prisoner <HI>John</HI> king of <HI>France,</HI> in the battle of <HI>Poitiers.</HI> This grant was also made by the black prince, who not only knighted <HI>Howel,</HI> but allowed a mess of meat to be served before his battle ax, in memory of the good use he made of it in that day; from which he acquired the name of <HI>Fwyall,</HI> or <HI>Howei</HI> or the ax<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Hist. <HI>Gwedir</HI> family.

<P><PB N="152" REF="173"/>ON each side of the <HI>Bridge-gate</HI> are two rounders:<NOTE PLACE="marg">BRIDGE-GATE.</NOTE> over it are the three feathers, the arms of the princes of <HI>Wales.</HI> Those were first assumed by the BLACK PRINCE after the battle of <HI>Cresh,</HI> in 1346: our historians assert, that they were the three ostrich-feathers which the king of <HI>Bohemia</HI> bore that day in his coronet; and that he was slain by <HI>Edward,</HI> who seizing on the crest, bore from that time both the feathers and the motto <HI>I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>b dien, I serve.</HI> I am unwilling to sully the honor of our gallant prince, by supposing that he would stain his sword in so unequal an encounter. The king was blind with age; and, finding the battle go against his allies, was led, by his own orders, into the rage of the combat, determined to die in the cause of <HI>France.</HI> Our brave prince, probably, might assume this royal cognizance in memory of the glorious day, and add to it his own motto, <HI>Ic dien,</HI> the old <HI>English</HI> for <HI>I serve</HI> allusive to the Scriptural verse, <HI>The heir while he is a child differeth not from a servant</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Cambden</HI>'s Remains, 344.</NOTE>, an imprese extremely suitable to the characteristic modesty and filial piety of this prince.</P>
<P>THIS and the other city gates were placed under the pro∣tection of certain great men, who held lands within the county palatine. The earl of <HI>Shrewshury</HI> had the care of the <HI>Bridge-gate;</HI> the earl of <HI>Oxford,</HI> of the <HI>East-gate;</HI> the earl of <HI>Derby,</HI> of the <HI>Water-gate.</HI> But the <HI>North-gate,</HI> belonging peculiarly to the city, was intrusted only to its chief magistrates. Tolls were exacted at entrance, from all strangers, for the support of the
<PB N="153" REF="174"/>
guard; and, notwithstanding the cause has long since ceased, are still demanded at the <HI>Bridge-gate.</HI></P>
<P>ABOVE the gate is a lofty octagonal tower,<NOTE PLACE="marg">WATER-WORKS.</NOTE> begun in 1600, by permission of the corporation, by <HI>John Tyrer</HI> of this city, containing the works which for a long time raised water out of the <HI>Dee</HI> to a cistern in the top, whence it was conveyed in pipes to almost all parts of the city. Possibly these did not answer their purpose effectually; for in 1622, <HI>Tyrer</HI> had a new grant of a tower erected for a water-work and a well-place, ten feet square, near <HI>Spittle Boughton,</HI> with full powers for the conveyance of the water to the cistern or conduit near the high-cross. This work (which was first begun by the <HI>black friers</HI> in the time of <HI>Edward</HI> I.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">De aquaeductu per ipsos (the black friers) faciendo a fonte prope furcas. Vide <HI>Tanner,</HI> 65.</NOTE>) fell to decay. In 1692, the works undertaken by <HI>Tyrer</HI> being found to be ruinous and useless, <HI>John Hopkins</HI> and <HI>John Hadley,</HI> by the encouragement of the corporation, began new works for supplying the city with water from the river <HI>Dee:</HI> for this purpose, they purchased the grant made to <HI>Tyrer,</HI> and also one of the corn-mills, for the conveniency of placing their engine. The city confirmed to them all the powers formerly vested in <HI>Tyrer,</HI> and particularly that of setting up a cistern opposite to the abby court, as a constant receptacle for fresh water.</P>
<P>NEAR the <HI>Bridge-gate</HI> is one ascent to the city walls;<NOTE PLACE="marg">WALLS.</NOTE> which are the only entire specimen of antient fortification now in <HI>Great Britain.</HI> They are a mile and three quarters, and a hun∣dred
<PB N="154" REF="175"/>
and one yards in circumference; and, being the principal walk of the inhabitants, are kept in excellent repair, by certain imposts,<NOTE PLACE="marg">MURRACE</NOTE> called murage duties, collected at the custom-house, upon all goods and merchandize brought into the port of <HI>Chester</HI> from parts beyond the seas, belonging to persons not freemen of the city. The <HI>Irish</HI> linen adds considerably to the fund, be∣ing nearly two-thirds of the whole: the duty on this article is two pence on every hundred yards. The annual receipt of the different duties, on the average of the last seven years, is about 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>0<HI>l..</HI> An officer, called a murenger, is chosen out of the body of the aldermen, to inspect the repairs; generally an old member, to whom the duty affords amusement and health. This fund is now permanent: in old times, the murage was only occasional. Thus, in the 14th of <HI>Edward</HI> II. there was a grant for two years of a half-penny for every cranock of corn; and a farthing of ale, meal, and malt; and for commodities not expressed in the grant, a farthing out of every two shillings-worth.</P>
<P>I CANNOT discover any vestige of the original walls, such as those which are said to have been restored by the warlike <HI>Ethelfleda.</HI> I would not willingly detract from the lady's merit; but I must deny her that of being the foundress of the forti∣fications, and of enlarging the city beyond the <HI>Roman</HI> precincts. The form at present is so entirely <HI>Roman,</HI> that any addition she could make would have destroyed the peculiar figure that wise people always preserved in their stations or castrametations, where∣soever the nature of the ground would permit. The antiquities which distinguish their residence are not found confined to any one quarter: they are met in digging on every side within the walls.</P>
<P><PB N="155" REF="176"/>THE military architecture is still entirely on the <HI>Roman</HI> plan; it is probable, that after their retreat it fell into ruin, in the empoverished, turbulent, and barbarous ages that succeeded, yet never was so totally demolished, but that it might still yield a defence to the possessors. We find it wrested out of the hands of the <HI>Britons</HI> by <HI>Egbert,</HI> in 828: we again see it possessed by the <HI>Danes</HI> in 895, and besieged by <HI>Alfred,</HI> who slew all the banditti whom he found <HI>without the walls;</HI> and, lastly, we find it taken by <HI>Ethelfleda,</HI> by the voluntary surrender of the garrison. All this proves a continuance of the fortifications, probably ruinous, and wanting that restoration which they found from that illustrious woman.</P>
<P>WE see the <HI>Roman</HI> mode of fortification preserved to this day, exactly on the antient plan. From each side of the gates projects a <HI>propugnaculum</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vegetius,</HI> lib. iv. c. 4.</NOTE> or bastion, in order to annoy the ene∣my who attempted to enter; and between them, in the very entrance, was the <HI>cataracta</HI> or portcullis, ready to be dropt in case they forced the gates, so that part of them might be caught within the walls, and the rest excluded. Should it happen that they set the gates on fire, there were holes above, in order to pour down water to extinguish the flames.</P>
<P>THE walls are in many parts, especially on the north and cast sides, guarded by towers, placed so as not to be beyond bow-shot of one another, in order that the archers might reach the enemy who attempted to attack the intervals<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Intervalla autem turrium ita sunt facienda ut ne longius sit alia ab alia sagittae intermissione, &amp;c, <HI>Vitruvius,</HI> lib. i. c. 5.</NOTE>. They also
<PB N="156" REF="177"/>
are mostly of a round form, as was recommended by the <HI>Roman</HI> architects, in order the better to elude the force of battering rams<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Turres itaque rotundae aut polygoniae sunt faciendae, <HI>quadratas</HI> enim ma∣chinae celerius dissipant, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Ibid. Turres sunt projiciendae in exteriorem partem, uti cum ad murum hostis im∣petu velit appropinquare, a turribus, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Ibid.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE thickness of the walls answer to the breadth prescribed by <HI>Vitruvius.</HI> Only two persons can walk abreast, excepting where the ground adjacent gives a larger expanse. The great architect directs, that they should be of such a breadth, that two armed men may pass each other without any impe∣diment.</P>
<P>THE city to this time enjoys the four gates; answerable to the <HI>principalis dextra &amp; sinistra, praetoria &amp; decumana.</HI> The <HI>East-gate,</HI> one of the <HI>principales,</HI> existed within my memory.</P>
<P>MY walk leads me beneath the castle, to another of the <HI>principales,</HI> the present <HI>Water-gate,</HI> that opens towards the water∣side, and near which the <HI>Dee</HI> in former times flowed.</P>
<P>AT the extreme angle of the city, beyond this gate, is a salient tower, exactly round,<NOTE PLACE="marg">WATER-TOWER.</NOTE> unless where interrupted by a small squared projection at the entrance. This tower is joined to the walls by a deep open gallery, embattled on each side, beneath is a large arch for the passage of the tide, before the late inclo∣sures, which also are within my remembrance. This tower is at present called the <HI>Water-tower.</HI> It jutted into the antient chan∣nel or the river, where the ships lay, which fastened their cables
<PB N="157" REF="178"/>
to its sides by the great iron rings infixed in the stone. This tower was formerly called the new; yet was founded in 1320; for there exists a contract for that purpose, between the mayor and citizens of <HI>Chester</HI> and one <HI>John de Helpston,</HI> mason, for building <HI>quandam turrem rotundum,</HI> &amp;c. a round tower <Q>of the thickness of ten yards and a half, with a cavity within; twenty-four yards high, and so strong as to be defensible;</Q> and all this for the sum of one hundred pounds<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Harleian MSS. N<SUP>o</SUP> 2046. 10.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE next remarkable outlet is the <HI>North-gate,</HI> beyond which is a large suburb.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Phoenix</HI> tower stands on the angle of the walls beyond this gate. The present tower was built in 1613, and was used by six of the companies of the city as a chamber for business. It took its name from the fabulous bird, the crest of the painter-stainers company, which was placed in front.</P>
<P>THE <HI>East-gate</HI> is the next entrance.<NOTE PLACE="marg">EAST-GATE.</NOTE> Here stood a lofty square tower, with many apartments, erected (according to tradi∣tion) by <HI>Edward</HI> III. This had been a <HI>Porta principalis,</HI> was the grand entrance into the town, and was the termination of the great <HI>Watling-street</HI> road, which crossed the island from <HI>Dover,</HI> and was the great road from that port to this place. In 1769, this gate, being found too narrow and inconvenient, was pulled down, and a magnificent arch arose in its room, at the sole ex∣pence of <HI>Richard</HI> lord <HI>Grosvenour.</HI> Beyond this is a vast sub∣urb, called the <HI>Forest-street;</HI> whose lower part was defended by a gate, demolished as a nusance within these few years.</P>
<P><PB N="158" REF="179"/>AFTER passing the <HI>East-gate,</HI> the traveller will observe, without the walls, a vast foss cut through the live rock, now a common road to the water; but which appears to me to have been a work of the <HI>Romans,</HI> as a defence on this side, and which con∣tinues the rectangular shape of the station.</P>
<P>THE views from the several parts of the walls are extremely elegant.<NOTE PLACE="marg">FINE-VIEWS.</NOTE> The mountains of <HI>Flintshire</HI> and <HI>Denbighshire,</HI> the hills of <HI>Broxton,</HI> and the insulated rock of <HI>Beeston,</HI> form the ruder part of the scenery, a rich flat gives a softer view; and the pro∣spect up the river towards <HI>Boughton</HI> recalls, in some degree, the idea of the <HI>Thames</HI> and <HI>Richmond-bill.</HI></P>
<P>ON the Conquest, as has been before related, the king visited this city in person, and restored the fortifications, It is probable that he only repaired the walls, but that he entirely re-built the castle<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ordericus Vitalis, 516.</NOTE> on the <HI>Norman</HI> model, and en∣larged it far beyond the dimensions of that of the <HI>Saxons,</HI> which occupied the summit of the mount or little hill on which the fortress stands. That part is artificial, in order to give a great elevation, as was customary in the <HI>Saxon</HI> keeps; and the portion so flung up appears here to have been a mixture of stones and exceedingly hard clay.</P>
<P>THE castle is composed of two parts, an upper and a lower: each with a strong gate,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CASTLE.</NOTE> defended by a round bastion on each side, with a ditch, and formerly with draw-bridges. Within the precincts of the upper <HI>Ballium</HI> are to be seen some towers of <HI>Norman</HI> architecture, square, with square projections at each
<PB N="159" REF="180"/>
corner, very slightly salient. The handsomest is that called <HI>Ju∣lius Caesar</HI>'s. Its entrance is through a large Gothic door, pro∣bably of later workmanship. The lowest room has a vaulted roof, strengthened with ordinary square couples. The upper had been a chapel, as appears by the holy-water pot, and some figures, almost obsolete, painted on the walls. Its dimensions are nineteen feet four inches, by sixteen six, the height also six∣teen feet six. The roof is vaulted; but the couples, which are rounded, slender, and elegant, run down the walls, and rest on the cornuted capitals of five short but beautiful round pillars, in the same style with those in the chapter-house of the cathe∣dral; probably the work of the same architect. The arsenal, some batteries, and certain habitable buildings, occupy the re∣maining part.</P>
<P>ON the sides of the lower court stands the noble room called <HI>Hugh Lupus</HI>'s hall,<NOTE PLACE="marg">LUPUS'S HALL.</NOTE> in which the courts of justice for the county are held. The length is very near ninety-nine feet; the breadth forty-five; the height very aweful, and worthy the state-apartment of a great baron. The roof supported by wood∣work, in a bold style, carved; and placed on the sides, resting on stout brackets.</P>
<P>THIS magnificent building probably retains its original dimen∣sions. The character of the first <HI>Norman</HI> earl required a hall suited to the greatness of his hospitality; which was confined to no bounds. 'He was,' says <HI>Ordericus</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lib, iv. p 522.</NOTE>, <Q>not only liberal, but prosuse. He did not carry a family with him, but an army.
<PB N="160" REF="181"/>
He kept no account of receits or disbursements. He was per∣petually wasting his estates: and was much fonder of falconers and huntsmen, than of cultivators of the land and holy men: and by his gluttony he grew so excessively fat, that he could hardly crawl about.</Q></P>
<P>ADJOINING to the end of this great hall is the court of ex∣chequer,<NOTE PLACE="marg">EXCHEQUER</NOTE> or the chancery of the county palatine of <HI>Chester.</HI> The earl of <HI>Cholmondely</HI> is the present chamberlain; Sir <HI>Richard Perrin,</HI> my worthy countryman, sits and discharges the office of vice-chamberlain. In respect to matters of equity, he here acts as lord chancellor. The chamberlain was one of the an∣tient earl's great officers, and had a fee of twenty-two pounds a year. This very building is said to have been the parlement∣house of the little kings of the palatinate. It savors of anti∣quity in the architecture; and within are a number of seats described by Gothic arches and neat pillars; at the upper end are two; one for the earl, the other for the abbot. The eight others were allotted to his eight barons, [and occupy one side of the room.</P>
<P>UNDER the vice-chamberlain is a baron, who holds a weekly court, in which appearances are entered for bringing causes to a trial. Writs and subpoenas are also here made out, as well for the great sessions for this county, as for those of the county of <HI>Flint.</HI> Here is, besides, an examiner; and a seal-keeper, who has the charge of the records.</P>
<P>THE judges have lodgings within the castle, during their circuit, by antient custom. These are furnished by the sheriffs of the city. The sheriffs of the county take care of their horses; but
<PB N="161" REF="182"/>
are allowed the expences when they bring in their accounts at the audit.</P>
<P>THE county jail for felons and debtors is the last place to be described.<NOTE PLACE="marg">JAIL</NOTE> I can do little more than confirm the account of it by the humane <HI>Howard.</HI> Their day-confinement is in a little yard, surrounded on all sides by lofty buildings, imper∣vious to the air, excepting from above, and ever unvisited by the purifying rays of the sun. Their nocturnal apartments are in cells seven feet and a half by three and a half; ranged on one side of a subterraneous dungeon; in each of which are often lodged three or four persons. The whole is rendered more (wholesomely) horrible, by being pitched over three or four times in the year. The scanty air of their streight prison-yard is to travel through three passages to arrive at them: through the window of an adjacent room; through a grate in the floor of the said room into the dungeon; and finally, through the dungeon, through a little grate above the door of each of their kennels. In such places as these are the innocent and the guilty permitted to be lodged, till the law decides their fate. I am sure the humane keeper, Mr. <HI>Thomas,</HI> must feel many a pang at the necessary discharge of his duty. Mr. HOWARD compares the place to the black-hole at <HI>Calcutta.</HI> The view I had of it, assisted to raise the idea of a much worse prison where</P>
<Q><L>No light, but rather darkness visible,</L>
<L>Served only to discover sights of woe.</L></Q>
<P>The constable of the castle holds his place for life; is properly the keeper of the prison; but appoints a deputy. He is ac∣countable
<PB N="162" REF="183"/>
for all prisoners and debtors, and answerable for their escapes.</P>
<P>WITHIN the walls of this fortress, was an instance of a felon suffering <HI>prison forte et dure,</HI> for standing mute on his trial, till he died of hunger.<NOTE PLACE="marg">PRISON FORTE IT DURE.</NOTE> One <HI>Adam,</HI> son of <HI>John,</HI> of the <HI>Woodhouses,</HI> was, in 1310, the 4th of <HI>Edward</HI> II. committed for burning his own houses, and carrying away the goods. He stood mute; a jury, as usual, was empanelled, who decided, that he could speak if he pleased. On this he was committed <HI>ad dietam;</HI> and after∣wards <HI>John le Morgan,</HI> constable of the castle, testified, that the aforesaid <HI>Adam</HI> was dead <HI>ad dietam</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Harleian</HI> MSS, N<SUP>o</SUP> 2079. 63.</NOTE>. This was the origin of the punishment of pressing to death, or the <HI>peine forte et dure,</HI> which seems a sort of merciful hastening of death; for it must have been much more horrible, as well as tedious, in the manner prescribed by the law of the first <HI>Edward,</HI> in whose reign it ori∣ginated. The words of the statute are, <Q>Qe les felouns ecriez et que sont apertement de male fame, et ne se voillent mettre en enqueste des felonies qe lem lui mette devant justices a la suite le Roy, <HI>soient mys en la prison fort et dure,</HI> &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P>THE term <HI>ad dietam</HI> was ironical, expressive of the sad suste∣nance the sufferer was allowed; <HI>viz.</HI> on the first day, three morsels of the worst bread; on the second, three draughts of water out of the next puddle: and this was to be alternately his daily diet till he died.</P>
<P>MR. RYMER records a strange instance of a woman at <HI>Not∣tingham,</HI> who underwent this punishment, and lived forty days
<PB N="163" REF="184"/>
without meat or drink. This happened in 1357, in the reign of <HI>Edward</HI> III. who, <Q>ad laudem Dei et gloriosae virginis MA∣RLAe matris suae, unde dictum miraculum processit, <HI>at credi∣tur</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The woman's name was <HI>Caecilia,</HI> indicted for the murder of her husband, <HI>John de Rygeway, Rymer</HI>'s Foedera, vi. 13.</NOTE>,</Q> granted the sufferer a free pardon. After mentioning, that it is probable that the miracle was a little assisted by natural means, I must observe, that, according to this instance, the con∣demned were, in some cases, absolutely denied any species of food; in others, it seems probable, from the name of the pu∣nishment of <HI>Adam,</HI> that they sometimes were allowed that wretched diet which was continued when the punishment changed into the <HI>peine dure et forte.</HI></P>
<P>THERE is a singularity in the manner of the treatment of the prisoners who are released by capital punishment out of their dreadful cells, which merits mention. They are delivered by the constable or his deputy, at a stone called <HI>Glover's-stone,</HI> about ninety yards distant from the outward gate, into the hands of the sheriffs of the city; who receive them at that stone, which is the extreme limit of the castle precincts, and from thence convey them to the place of execution, which they also have the charge of. This custom is not accounted for, any more than by tradition, that a felon was formerly rescued in his way to the gallows by the citizens of <HI>Chester,</HI> and perhaps by the connivance of the magistrates, who are supposed to have had the disagreeable duty inflicted on them of executing all criminals, whether they are of the county or the city.</P>
<P><PB N="164" REF="185"/>THE city was separated from the castle, and made a county of itself, by the charter of <HI>Henry</HI> VII: the castle was left as an ap∣pertance to the shire; and has the small outlet of a little street called <HI>Glover's-stone,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">GLOVER'S STONE.</NOTE> which is also independent of the city; and in which non-freemen may set up any trade unmolested by the corporation.</P>
<P>THE castle has a governor, lieutenant-governor, and constable; and is garrisoned by two companies of invalids.</P>
<P>THE civil government and architecture is next to be taken notice of. I have, in my account of <HI>Saxon</HI> and <HI>Norman</HI> CHES∣TER, given a brief relation of the government of the city in those periods. I shall at present only mention the principal charters; and flatter myself, that the reader will excuse my brevity, not only as it is beyond the power of the travelling topographer to collect the same materials as the resident; but because his curiosity will, it is to be hoped, soon be satisfied by the publication of the history of this city by the Reverend Doctor GOWER, which will amply supply all my defici∣encies.</P>
<P>THE first royal charter which this city was honored with is that of <HI>Henry</HI> III;<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHARTERS.</NOTE> who confirms all the priveleges bestowed on them by the <HI>Norman</HI> earls, and, I imagine, first flung the government into the form of a regular corporation; for he grants and confirms to them, that none shall buy or sell mer∣chandise in the city except citizens, unless it be in the fairs, under the penalty of ten pounds.</P>
<P>EDWARD I. gave the city of <HI>Chester,</HI> with the appertenances, and all the liberties and priveleges, to its citizens and their heirs,
<PB N="165" REF="186"/>
to be holden of him and his heirs for ever, paying annually 100 <HI>l;</HI> he also granted them the election of a coroner, and pleas of the crown; and that they should have sock<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sock, he who is invested with this, has power to hold courts within his own lands. SACK, power of deciding complaints and quarrels, and applying to his own use the fines resulting from such decisions within his own territory. TOLL, needs no explanation. THEME, the right to dispose of all his bonds∣men, their children, and goods. INEANGTHEFE, the power of apprehending, in his own lands, thieves, whether they be his own people or those of another lord. OUTFANGTHEFE, is the power of seizing, in any person's land, a vassal of his own, who has committed a robbery within his jurisdiction, and bringing him to trial to his own court. <HI>Vide</HI> Skene, de verb, signific. and <HI>So<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r</HI>'s Gloss.</NOTE>, sack, toll, theme, infangthefe, outfangthefe, and freedom throughout all the land and dominion, of toll, passage, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>EDWARD III. confirmed the past grants, and added another, of all the vacant lands within the liberty of the city, with leave for the citizens to build on such vacant spots.</P>
<P>EDWARD the black prince prescribed by particular names the boundaries of the city, beginning at the <HI>Iron-bridge,</HI> and from thence to <HI>Saltney,</HI> the <HI>Port-pool, Flukersbrook, Boughton,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>RICHARD II. was particularly kind to his favorite city. In consideration of some distresses it had undergone, he released them from the payment of seventy-three pounds ten shillings and eight-pence arrears of rent due to the crown: he gave them the profits of the ferry towards the re-building and repairing of <HI>Dee</HI> bridge: he made them two grants of the murage, the first for four years, the second for five, for the repairs of the walls.
<PB N="166" REF="187"/>
But in the 22d year of his reign, <Q>for the furtherance of justice in the same city, and better execution thereof, he grants unto his subjects, majors, sheriffs, and commonalty of the said city, to hold their courts; and limited what processes they might award in, actions, personal felonies, appeals, processes of utlagary, as at common law. Granted under the seal of the principality of <HI>Chester,</HI> at <HI>Chester, May</HI> 2, 1398<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">King, ii. 159</NOTE>.</Q> This seems to have been found necessary, in order to strengthen the civil policy of this place, which had four years before been greatly insulted by a dreadful riot in the abby by Sir <HI>Baldwyne</HI> of <HI>Radyngstone,</HI> supported by Sir <HI>John</HI> of <HI>Stanley</HI> with eight hundred men. A sheriff was killed, and many other excesses committed<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Harleian</HI> MSS. N<SUP>o</SUP> 2057. 34.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>AFTER the revolution which happened in 1399, the mayor and citizens continued to favor the cause of their deposed master; and after his death, gave all the assistance in their power to <HI>Harry Percy.</HI> On his defeat, they obtained the royal pardon; and in order to conciliate their affections, young <HI>Henry</HI> prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> and earl of <HI>Chester,</HI> confirmed all their former charters and priveleges; and afterwards granted to them the profits of murage and bridge tower, where tolls were collected, <HI>durante bene placito.</HI></P>
<P>IN a confirmation of the former charters by <HI>Henry</HI> VI. we learn the former concourse of strangers; the greatness of the commerce of <HI>Chester,</HI> by reason of the goodness of its port; and the great trade carried on in provisions into and out of
<PB N="167" REF="188"/>
<HI>Wales.</HI> It farther recites the melancholy change of affairs; the conflux of foreign merchants being put a stop to by the choaking of the creek with sands; and the intercourse with <HI>Wales</HI> destroyed, since the insurrection of <HI>Owen Glendwr:</HI> which considerations moved the king to remit ten pounds of the antient fee-farm rent.</P>
<P>THE provisions alluded to were probably cheeses, on the part of the citizens of <HI>Chester;</HI> and perhaps wines, spices, and other foreign luxuries; for which they might receive in exchange from the <HI>Welsh,</HI> cattle of different kinds.</P>
<P>HENRY VII.<NOTE PLACE="marg">MEMBERS.</NOTE> in 1506, in consideration of farther distresses of the city, not only remitted eighty pounds of its annual rent; but granted it a new charter, by which he separated it from the county, and granted it several of the most valuable prive∣leges which it still enjoys: but being a county palatine, and in the time of <HI>Edward</HI> I. vested in the crown, never received summons, either for county or city, to return members to parlement, till the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. when the county, in 1543, was empowered to send two knights, and the city two citizens. The electors of the last are the freemen of the city; the returning-officers the sheriffs.</P>
<P>THE corporation consists of a mayor,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CORPORATION.</NOTE> recorder, two sheriff s, twenty-four aldermen, and forty common-council. Here are beside two annual officers, called <HI>leave-lookers,</HI> whose business was to prevent all persons who are not free of the city from exer∣cising any trade, or exposing to sale any wares or merchandise within the liberties. They were accustomed to go round the city in order to preserve these its privileges; and sometimes were used

to take small sums, called <HI>leave-lookerage,</HI> for <HI>leave</HI> for non-free∣men to sell wares by retail; but at present the yeoman of the Pentise discharges this office, and returns the names of such per∣sons who are found to offend, in order that actions might be brought against them. We find, as early as 1297, that similar officers were elected, under the name of <HI>custos guild mercator;</HI> and who discharged the same function<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">King, ii. 167.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE places where the mayor and other officers of the corpo∣ration assemble for the dispatch of business,<NOTE PLACE="marg">PEXTISE.</NOTE> or administration of justice, are two; the first is the Pentise, an antient building in the center of the city, near the junction of the four principal streets. Mention is made of the north-side having been builded in 1497. Here all business within the cognizance of a justice of the peace is transacted; the aldermen that have past the chair being empowered to act as long as they wear the gown. Here also the sheriffs, assisted by the recorder, sit and determine civil causes.</P>
<P>I IMAGINE that this building,<NOTE PLACE="marg">PRAETORIUM.</NOTE> St. <HI>Peter</HI>'s church, and a few houses to the north and west, occupy the site of the <HI>Roman Prae∣torium;</HI> for they not only fill the very situation of that part of the old castrametations, but account for the discontinuance of the <HI>Bridge street,</HI> which ceases opposite to these edifices. This also is the cause why the nearer part of the <HI>North-gate street</HI> is thrown out of its course, and falls into the <HI>East-gate street,</HI> many yards beyond the mouth of the <HI>Bridge street;</HI> for the lower part of the <HI>North-gate street,</HI> where the exchange and shambles stand.
<PB N="169" REF="190"/>
points directly towards the former; but is interrupted by the space occupied by these buildings. The limit of the <HI>Praetorium</HI> on the east, was the narrow portion of <HI>North-gate street;</HI> on the south, part of the present <HI>Bridge, East-gate,</HI> and <HI>Water-gate streets;</HI> on the west <HI>Goss lane;</HI> and on the north, the space now occupied by the fish-market. The <HI>praetorium,</HI> with its attendants, de∣manded no small space; for, besides the spot possessed by the general, were the apartments of the <HI>imperatoris contubernales,</HI> or the young nobility immediately under his care; the <HI>augurale,</HI> where prayers, sacrifices, and other religious rites were performed, which might have stood on the site of the modern church; and the general might have had his tribunal on the very spot where the worshipful corporation at present sit for the redress of grievances.</P>
<P>THE courts of justice are held in the common hall,<NOTE PLACE="marg">EXCHANGE.</NOTE> a large and commodious room over the exchange, adorned with the portraits of several popular persons: among them is a full-length of Sir <HI>William Williams,</HI> recorder of this city, speaker of the house of commons in the reign of <HI>Charles</HI> II. and solicitor-general in that of his successor. In this place are held a crown-mote court, portmote court, and court of sessions. The mayor, assisted by the recorder, is judge of the crownmote court. He has jurisdiction in all criminal causes, treason only excepted. He is also judge of the portmote court, with the same assistant. This court holds plea in all actions real, personal, and mixed. In the court of sessions, the aldermen above the chair try petty-larcenies, and determine upon inferior offences. In this place, the body corporate hold their assemblies for making bye-laws
<PB N="170" REF="191"/>
for the government of the city; for managing the public build∣ings and directing the charities; and finally, the city elec∣tions of magistrates, as well as members, are made in this court.</P>
<P>THE only remains of any <HI>hotel,</HI> and that of no antient date, stood in <HI>Old Common-ball lane;</HI> which, when entire, surrounded a square, and communicated with <HI>Water-gate street.</HI> It was founded by Sir <HI>Thomas Egerton,</HI> chamberlain of <HI>Chester,</HI> afterwards lord chan∣cellor of <HI>England,</HI> and designed by him for a dwelling-house. The small remainder, which faced the lane, and was occupied by a poor family, on the 5th of <HI>November</HI> 1772, was the scene of a dreadful calamity. The first floor was engaged by a puppet-show man; and at the moment he was exhibiting to a very full audience, by some unknown accident 800 pounds weight of gunpowder, which was lodged in a warehouse beneath, took fire, and blew up three stories. Twenty-three people pe∣rished, and eighty-three were much burnt, bruised, and received broken and dislocated limbs; of which number only three died, and those with locked jaws. The remedy found most efficacious for the burnt, was <HI>Goulard</HI>'s extract of lead.</P>
<P>THE external effects of this explosion were these: the win∣dows and broken glass of several of the neighboring houses fell outwards; from which it appears, that they were not broken by the shock of the gunpowder, but by the pressure of the air within the apartments, which rushed out into the <HI>vacuum</HI> oc∣casioned by the explosion. A similar phaenomenon has been remarked from an explosion from the inflammable vapor of a mine, when the neighboring trees fell towards the blast. Howso∣ever,
<PB N="171" REF="192"/>
where the force of the powder was confined by narrow passages, its centrifugal effect took place; for two boys, walk∣ing along the rows in <HI>Water-gate street,</HI> opposite to a passage leading to the building, were blown, one against the rails, the other into the street; and the roof of a house was blown off, op∣posite a passage into <HI>Common-hall lane.</HI></P>
<P>IT is much to be wished, that the easy magistracy of this city would, from this dire accident, take into consideration the safety of the whole, in preference to the conveniency of a few lazy individuals; and either compel them to keep by them only the legal quantity, or at their session appoint proper places for lodging gunpowder. This is the second tremendous warning of the same nature which the city hath been visited with. On the first of <HI>April</HI> 1726, the shop of Mr. <HI>Thomas Murray</HI> in <HI>Bridge street,</HI> and the house, were blown up; and himself and a young gentleman killed. Notwithstanding this double admoni∣tion, I fear its attention still continues lethargic.</P>
<P>THE surviving sufferers of this calamity were relieved<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">630 <HI>l.</HI> was also immediately collected from the humane inhabitants of the city, to be distributed among these miserable maimed objects.</NOTE> in the well-regulated infirmary established here, and supported by the voluntary contributions from the city, county, and neigh∣boring parts of <HI>Wales.</HI> It is a handsome building, in an airy situation, and detached from the streets. This charity was founded in 1756, and originated from a bequest of 300 <HI>l.</HI> left by Dr. <HI>Stratford,</HI> commissary of <HI>Richmond,</HI> towards the com∣mencing of a public hospital in this city. Subscriptions were
<PB N="172" REF="193"/>
circulated, and a sum equal to the design soon raised. Before the present building could be ready for the reception of patients, a temporary infirmary was prepared for them, in 1756, in <HI>North∣gate street.</HI> The new infirmary was opened on the 17th of <HI>March</HI> 1761; and has been supported with a spirit that does honor to the environs; which has enabled the managers to receive, since its institution, not fewer than thirteen thousand six hun∣dred and thirty-six objects of relief. The portrait of the founder is placed in the council-room of the infirmary; a three-quarters piece, sitting, in a long wig and civilian's gown.</P>
<P>I SHALL now take a short view of the ecclesiastical state of this antient city. It is necessary first to observe, that the <HI>Mercian</HI> kingdom was divided into five bishopricks; <HI>Lichfield, Chester, Worcester, Lydnecester,</HI> and <HI>Dorchester;</HI> which last was afterwards removed to <HI>Lincoln. Lichfield</HI> was made, about the year 785, metropolitan, by order of <HI>Offa,</HI> and afterwards, for a long space, incorporated into itself its suffragan, <HI>Chester.</HI> How greatly the last flourished is evident from an account of its annual payment to the pope in very early times; for, when <HI>Lichfield</HI> payed only three thousand florins, our see advanced five thousand. No wonder that its jealousy should be excited! Very little is known of the state of this church in the <HI>Saxon</HI> period. Let it suffice to say, that a bishop of <HI>Lichfield,</HI> of the name of <HI>Peter,</HI> in the year 1075, removed his episcopal seat to <HI>Chester;</HI> and during his life made use of the church of St. <HI>John</HI>'s for his cathedral. This translation was of very short date; for his successor established himself in the former diocese, and <HI>Chester</HI> continued without a bishop till the dissolution of monasteries; when, in 1541,
<PB N="173" REF="194"/>
<HI>Henry</HI> VIII. restored it to its former honor, by creating it one of the six<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Westminster, Oxford, Bristol, Gloster, Peterborough, <HI>and</HI> Chester. <HI>The first was suppressed in the reign of queen</HI> Mary.</NOTE> new sees formed on that great event; and converted the church of the late abby of St. <HI>Werburgh</HI> into the ca∣thedral.</P>
<P>THE first of the new bishops was <HI>John Bird,</HI> a <HI>Carmelite,</HI> and provincial of the order; a man subservient to the court; who, by preaching against the pope's supremacy, so recom∣mended himself to the king as to obtain the bishoprick of <HI>Bangor;</HI> from whence he was removed to <HI>Chester,</HI> as a fit per∣son to suit the rapacity of the times. In 1546, he granted away the whole of the manors and demesnes of the see, and, accepting impropriation instead of them, left his successors not a single acre, excepting that on which the palace stands, and the court before it; another house, adjacent; a little orchard called the <HI>Woodyard;</HI> two houses near St. <HI>John</HI>'s church; and a few small tenements in the city of <HI>York.</HI> Notwithstanding the sum he amassed, he was found, at the accession of <HI>Mary,</HI> in debt to the crown 1087 <HI>l.</HI> 18 <HI>s.</HI> for tenths and subsidies; a vast sum for the times! His interest with bishop <HI>Bonner</HI> still would have saved him, had he not committed (in those days) the heinous crime of matrimony, for which he was deprived in 1554.</P>
<P>HE left his diocese one of the lest in value, yet greatest: in extent, of any in <HI>England;</HI> for it reaches from <HI>Hawarden</HI> in <HI>Flintshire,</HI> to the river <HI>Derwent</HI> in <HI>Cumberland:</HI> comprehending the entire counties of <HI>Cheshire</HI> and <HI>Lancashire;</HI> part of <HI>Westmore∣land,</HI>

<P>THE abby,<NOTE PLACE="marg">ABBY.</NOTE> out of which this see was formed, was of great antiquity. History relates, that it had been originally a nunnery, founded about the year 660, by <HI>Wulpherus,</HI> king of the <HI>Mer∣cians,</HI> in favor of his daughter's indisposition to a married life. This was the celebrated St. <HI>Werburgh,</HI> who took the veil after living immaculate for three years with her husband <HI>Ceolredus,</HI> after the example of her aunt, the great <HI>Ethelreda;</HI> who coha∣bited for three years with no less purity with her first spouse <HI>Tonberctus,</HI> and for twelve with her second, the pious prince <HI>Eg∣frid.</HI> St. <HI>Werburgh</HI> presided over several <HI>Mercian</HI> monasteries, died at <HI>Tricengham,</HI> and by her own order was interred at <HI>Heanburge;</HI> but on the approach of the <HI>Danes,</HI> in 875, her body was con∣veyed to <HI>Chester,</HI> as a place of security from the insults of those pagans<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hiden <HI>in</HI> Gale, iii. 240.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IT is uncertain how long this community existed. It probably was ruined by the ravages of the barbarians in 895, and finally suppressed; for we are told<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>, that from the reign of king <HI>Athelstan,</HI> in 925, to the coming of the <HI>Normans,</HI> a set of canons secular were established in the place of the nuns. This pious deed was that of <HI>Ethelsleda;</HI> who restored the buildings; which afterwards were repaired by earl <HI>Leofric,</HI> husband to the famous <HI>Go∣diva.</HI> The house was richly endowed by the kings <HI>Edmund</HI> and
<PB N="175" REF="196"/>
<HI>Edgar,</HI> and by <HI>Leofric. Edgar</HI>'s charter begins in a strain equally pious and sublime<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Dugdale,</HI> Monast. i. 200.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>ON the accession of <HI>Hugh Lupus</HI> to this earldom, he suppressed the canons secular, and established in their place a colony of his countrymen, <HI>Benedictines,</HI> from <HI>Bec</HI> in <HI>Normandy;</HI> for pro∣bably he did not care to trust his salvation to the prayers of the <HI>Saxon</HI> religious. It is said, that this piece of piety was owing to a fit of illness which the earl was seized with; when he took the usual way in those days of soothing a troubled conscience. <HI>Anselm,</HI> abbot of <HI>Bec,</HI> and afterwards archbishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> regulated the new foundation; and appointed his chaplain <HI>Richard</HI> to be the first abbot. <HI>Lupus</HI> and his successors were very liberal in their endowments<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Idem, 985, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE>; and the place flou∣rished till its dissolution; which was effected by the surrender of the last abbot, <HI>Thomas Clerk;</HI> who received in reward the of∣fice of the new deanry, which he enjoyed only six weeks. The revenues of this great abby were, according to <HI>Dugdale,</HI> 1003 <HI>l.</HI> 5 <HI>s.</HI> II <HI>d.</HI> to Speed, 1073 <HI>l.</HI> 17 <HI>s.</HI> 7 <HI>d.</HI></P>
<P>ACCORDING to a survey of this abby, preserved in the <HI>Harleian</HI> collection, its extent was very considerable; surrounding the present square, and covering several parts of the adjacent ground. The old abby-court is adorned on two sides by very handsome modern houses, built between the years 1750 and 1754, on leases granted by the dean and chapter. Another side is filled by the new palace; an elegant pile, which rose under the auspices of that munificent and hospitable prelate <HI>Edmund</HI>
<PB N="176" REF="197"/>
<HI>Keen,</HI> present bishop of <HI>Ely.</HI> Its place was before occupied by the house of the antient abbots.</P>
<P>THE old gate is yet standing: is a plain but noble entrance; and consists, towards the street, of two Gothic arches included within a round one, of great diameter; and which appears <HI>to</HI> have been of far older date. One side was the porter's lodge; on the other, a place called St. <HI>Thomas</HI>'s court. A chapel, dedicated to the same saint, stood where the present deanry is; and, from its antient appearance, seems to have been externally the same building.</P>
<P>THE cloisters are entire; but consist only of three walks, the court extending on one side quite to the church. By the dif∣ferent arms on the roof, it appears to have been repaired at several times, from the time of <HI>Edward</HI> III. to that of <HI>W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sey</HI> whose arms, with those of the see of <HI>York,</HI> with the cardinal's cap, are also to be seen here.</P>
<P>ON one side stood the fratry;<NOTE PLACE="marg">SCHOOL</NOTE> a vast room, which is used as a free-school, founded by <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. in the 36th year of his reign, for twenty-four boys, who are appointed by the dean and chapter: they may continue there four years, if their conduct be regular; but the dean has power to grant a year of grace. No boy (unless he be a choirister) ought to be chosen before he is nine years old, or after he is fifteen. Two masters are appointed for their instruction, a chief and an under master; elected by the dean and chapter.</P>
<P>IN a corner of the east-side of the cloister, is a passage and stairs to the dormitory; and the antient priests cellars and kitchen. On the same side is a passage, formerly called the Maidens aile,</P>
<P><PB REF="198"/>
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P><PB N="177" REF="199"/>which leads to the little abby-court, a part of the antient build∣ing belonging to the prebends.</P>
<P>THE beautiful edifice,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAPTER-HOUSE.</NOTE> the chapter-house, stands in the same walk, of the cloister. The vestibule is arched, supported by four columns, each surrounded with eight slender pilasters with∣out capitals, which converge near the top of the column, and spread over the roof. The dimensions of this room are thirty-three feet four inches, by twenty-seven four; the height twelve feet nine. On the sides is a stone-feat for the attendants on the business of the chapter.</P>
<P>THE chapter-house is fifty feet long, twenty-six feet broad, end thirty-five feet high; at the upper end is a window, con∣sisting of five lancet-shaped divisions; and on each side is ano∣ther of three. At the height of eight feet and a half from the floor, a narrow gallery runs along three parts of the room, divided from the windows by a triplet of most elegant, lofty, slender pillars. The roof is of stone; the springs of the arches which secure it, are supported by neat pilasters with palmy capitals.</P>
<P>THE modern book-cases deform the lower parts of the room, as high as the bottoms of the windows. The walls, 1 conjecture, had been ornamented with pilasters, and had a stone-seat like that of the vestibule. The entrance, both from the cloisters and between the vestibule and the chapter-house, are Gothic; but apparently of a later species of architecture than either of those rooms.</P>
<P>THE chapter-house was built, in all probability, in the time of <HI>Rendle the first,</HI> earl of <HI>Chesler,</HI> who died in 1128, after en∣joying
<PB N="178" REF="200"/>
his earldom eight years. The great earl, <HI>Hugh Lupus</HI> uncle to <HI>Randle,</HI> had been interred in the church-yard of the abby: the first care of the nephew was to remove the body into this building<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Leicester's Hist.</HI> Antiq. 127.</NOTE>, as the most honorable place; a respect which would certainly have been payed to it, had this edifice existed at the time of his death. Here his remains continued unmolested till the year 1724, when, in digging within the chapter-house, they were found in a stone coffin, wrapped in leather, with a cross on the breast; and at the head of the coffin a stone in shape of a T, with the wolf's head, the allusion to his name, engraven on it. Other coffins were discovered beneath the two rooms, of earls, their countesses, or of abbots; but the great leveller death had reduced them to dust indistinguishable.</P>
<P>THE earls who were interred here, were <HI>Hugh,</HI> who died in 1101; <HI>Randle the first,</HI> or <HI>de Meschina,</HI> in 1128; <HI>Randle the second,</HI> or <HI>de Gernouns,</HI> who was poisoned in 1155, by <HI>William Peverel; Hugh Cyvelioc,</HI> who died at <HI>Leek</HI> in 1181; <HI>Randle the third,</HI> or <HI>de Blundeville,</HI> who died at <HI>Wallingford</HI> in 1232, where his bowels were interred; his heart was buried at the abby of <HI>Dieulacres</HI> in <HI>Staffordshire,</HI> and his body transported to <HI>Chester:</HI> finally, <HI>John Scot,</HI> who, in 1237, underwent the same fate as <HI>Randle the second.</HI> So that every earl of the <HI>Norman</HI> line were deposited here, excepting <HI>Richard,</HI> who perished by shipwreck; in 1120<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The particulars of the deaths of this illustriou. line may be seen is LEICESTER: or in DUGDALE'S <HI>Baronage,</HI> i. 32, &amp;c.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>THE church bounds the north side of the cloisters. The lower part of the wall has a row of arches, now filled up, and savors more of antiquity than any other part, This, and a portion of the north-transepts, are the oldest parts of the present building; but there is no part left at present that can boast of a remote date. All the labors of the <HI>Saxons,</HI> and almost all of those of its re-founder <HI>Hugh Lupus,</HI> are now lost. The abbot, <HI>Simon Ripley,</HI> who was elected in 1485, finished the middle aile and the tower. The body is supported by six sharp-pointed arches. The co∣lumns are thick, surrounded by pilasters with small rounded capitals. Above is a gallery, with a neat stone balustrade in the parts where it is entire, and a row of large and broad, pointed windows; which is the general style.</P>
<P>THE present cathedral appears to have been built (excepting the slight fragments just mentioned) in the reigns of <HI>Henry</HI> VI. VII. and VIII; but principally in that of the two last. The beau∣tiful west-end was begun in 1508, and the first stone laid with much ceremony. The window over the door is filled with beau∣tiful tracery; and the door-case enriched with figures and other sculpture. The descent into the church is down a multitude of steps; so there is reason to suspect, that the present was on the foundation of the antient church; which had been on a level with the old streets, which we know are many feet higher than they were originally, by the accession of rubbish, and other adventitious matter.</P>
<P><PB N="180" REF="203"/>THE center beneath the great tower is greatly injured by a modern bell-loft, which conceals a crown-work of stone, that would have a good effect was the loft destroyed.</P>
<P>FROM the springs of arches that appear in the walls of the n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e and its ailes, it appears as if the architect had intended to have vaulted them, in the manner in which St. <HI>Mary</HI>'s chapel and the choiral ailes are done.</P>
<P>THE choir is very neat; and the Gothic tabernacle-work over the stalls carved in a light and elegant manner. The arches in the galleries are divided by pretty slender pillars; and perhaps were of a date prior to the body of the church; probably the work of abbot <HI>Oldham,</HI> who was a benefactor, and had a con∣cern in the building.</P>
<P>IN the chancel are four stone-stalls for the officiating priests; with carved Gothic work above; a recess or two for the pre∣serving either the reliques or the sacred utensils. About the walls are dispersed the monuments of several bishops and church∣men; but none of any magnificence; and one of Sir <HI>William Manwaring,</HI> a gallant young man, who sell in the defence of the city during its long siege.</P>
<P>THE bishop's throne stands on a stone base, as remarkable for its sculpture as its original use. Its form is an oblong square; and each side most richly ornamented with Gothic carving, arches, and pinnacles. Around the upper part is a range of little images, designed to represent the kings and saints of the <HI>Mercian</HI> kingdom. Each held in one hand a scroll with the name inscribed. Fanatic ignorance mutilated many of the la∣bels, as well as the figures; but the last were restored about
<PB N="181" REF="204"/>
the year 1748; but the workman, by an unlucky mistake, has placed female heads on male shoulders, and given manly faces to the bodies of the fair-sex. At first, there were thirty-four figures: four are lost; the remainder are faithfully described, and the history of each monarch and saint accurately given, in a little pamphlet, published in 1749, by the worthy Doctor <HI>William Cooper,</HI> who dedicated the profits for the use of the blue∣coat hospital in this city. I beg leave to dissent from the notion of this having been the shrine of St. <HI>Werbugh,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">ST. WERBURCH'S SHRINE</NOTE> as it is po∣pularly called. It certainly was nothing more than the pedestal on which the real shrine, or, as the <HI>French</HI> call it, <HI>la chasse,</HI> stood, which contained the sacred reliques. These are made of gold, silver, vermeil, <HI>i. e,</HI> silver gilt, or some precious materials, and often enriched with gems of great value. They are of different forms, such as churches, cabinets, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and, should the relique be a head, or limb, the <HI>chasse</HI> is made conformable to the shape of the part. These are seated usually conspicuous on an ele∣vated place; and are always moveable, in order that they may be carried in procession, either in honor of the saint, or to divert some great calamity. Thus, in 1180, the shrine of St. <HI>Werburgh</HI> was brought out to stop the rage of a fire in the city, which for a long time was invincible by every other means; but the approach of the holy remains instantly proved their sanctity, by putting an end to its furious desolation.</P>
<P>BEFORE I take leave of this part of the church,<NOTE PLACE="marg">ASSASSINATION.</NOTE> I must men∣tion an impious outrage committed at the high altar in 1492, by a gentleman of <HI>Wales,</HI> who wounded almost to death one <HI>Patrick Filling,</HI> I suppose the officiating priest. The church, as
<PB N="182" REF="205"/>
usual, was immediately suspended, till a lustration in order to purify it from the foul stain was performed. The abby was reconciled on St. <HI>Werburgh</HI>'s day; the parish-church on that of St. <HI>Oswald</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">King, ii. 189.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>AN impiety of this kind was committed in the church of <HI>Notre Dame</HI> at <HI>Paris,</HI> in 1670<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Felibica Hist. Paris, ii, 1500. Pieces Justif. iii. 212.</NOTE>. The priest died of his wound; and expiation was made by order of the archbishop: public prayers were offered up for forty hours in all the churches; processions made; a fast of three days appointed. The whole terminated by a general (<HI>reparation</HI>) satisfaction of the injury by a grand pro∣cession, in which the whole parlement assisted. The streets were covered with tapestry, and the avenues barred up with the chains to keep off the mob; and thus the place was restored to the discharge of the sacred offices.</P>
<P>IT is with a kind of horror I read in the zealous <HI>Fox,</HI> of an outrage of this sort committed in our own kingdom, in the reign of queen <HI>Mary</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Martyrs., iii.</NOTE>. The enthusiast was taken, and punished by the striking off the criminal hand, and by being burnt: yet the historian gives him a place among the more well-meaning sufferers of that barbarous period.</P>
<P>BEHIND the choir is St. <HI>Mary</HI>'s chapel; and on each side is an aile. The monuments in these parts are in no wise remark∣able. In its north-aile is a tomb with a flowery cross, that of an abbot; and another of an altar-form, ascribed to <HI>Henry</HI> IV. em∣peror of <HI>Germany,</HI> who, according to a legendary tale, was
<PB N="183" REF="206"/>
said to have escaped from his troubles, and to have resided in <HI>Godstall lane,</HI> in this city; to have died there; and to have been interred in the abby.

<P>The transepts are of unequal lengths. The north is very large. dedicated to St. <HI>Oswald,</HI> and is the parish-church of that name. This is said to have stood on the first church of St. <HI>Peter</HI> and St. <HI>Paul;</HI> which was afterwards changed to that of the <HI>Holy Trinity,</HI> and finally, to the name it now bears. On the re∣building of the church, this aile was designedly enlarged, and allotted by the monks to the neighboring inhabitants, who were for the most part their servants or tenants. At first, the reli∣gious wished to have the whole to themselves, and on that ac∣count built, at a distance from this aile, a chapel called St. <HI>Nicholas</HI>'s, and endowed it with a vicarage, for the use of the laity; but afterwards, at the request. of the inhabitants, and by composition between the mayor and abbot, about the year 1488, they were restored to the use of the church of St. <HI>Oswald,</HI> which they still retain<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>King,</HI> ii. 39. 196.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE chapel falling into disuse, was purchased by the citizens, and converted into their common-hall for dispatch of business<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">It is probable that there had been a more antient common-hall; a lane in this city still retains the name of <HI>Old Common-hall lane.</HI></NOTE>. In later times, since the building of the exchange, it has been

converted into a magazine for wool; into a carrier's warehouse; and part into a theatre, acting under parlementary license.</P>
<P>THIS abby afforded only a temporary sanctuary to the prosh∣gate. The privelege which <HI>Hugh Lupus</HI> granted is particular: he ordered, that no thief or other malefactor, that attended the fair held at the feast of St. <HI>Werburgh,</HI> should be attached, unless he committed some new offence there<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Leicester,</HI> 119.</NOTE>. This, says <HI>King,</HI> drew a vast: concourse of loose people together at that season, and proved of singular advantage to <HI>Randle the third,</HI> earl of <HI>Chester;</HI> who, in being surrounded in the castle of <HI>Rudland</HI> by a nu∣merous army of <HI>Welsh,</HI> and in great danger, sent for relief to his general, <HI>Roger Lacy,</HI> at that time attending the midsummer-fair. <HI>Lacy</HI> instantly collected a body of minstrels, fiddlers, and idle people, who were assembled here on account of this privelege; marched with them into <HI>Wales,</HI> and relieved the earl from his distress. <HI>Randle,</HI> on his return, immediately rewarded <HI>Lacy</HI> with a full power over all the instruments of his preservation, <HI>me∣gisterium omnium lecatorum et meretricam totius</HI> CESTRESHIRE. By this grant he was empowered to require the attendance of all the minstrels and musicians of the county on the anniversary of the exploit. They were to play before him and his heirs for ever, in a procession to the church of St. <HI>John;</HI> and, after divine service, to the place where he kept his court. The minstrels were there examined concerning their lives and conversation; whether any of them played without annual licence from their lord, or whether they had heard any words among their fellows
<PB N="185" REF="208"/>
tending to his dishonor. These priveleges were afterwards devolved by <HI>John,</HI> son of <HI>Roger de Lacy,</HI> to <HI>Hugh de Dutton</HI> and his heirs. The procession and courts were held by their steward within my memory; but the custom is now dropt. I find also, that <HI>Dutton</HI> and his heirs clamed at the feast from the minstrels, <HI>quatuor lagenas vini et unam lancem,</HI> four bottles of wine, and one lance; and at the same time a fee of four pence halfpenny: and from every <HI>Meretrix</HI> in <HI>Cheshire,</HI> and in the city of <HI>Chester, officium suum exercente,</HI> four pence<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Leicester,</HI> 142</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE other religious houses in this city were,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CARMELITES.</NOTE> the <HI>Carmelites,</HI> or <HI>White friers,</HI> who had a convent in that part of St. <HI>Martin</HI>'s parish still called <HI>White-friers lane:</HI> part of Mr. <HI>Marsden</HI>'s house is formed of the remains. The church, as appears by <HI>Braun</HI>'s view of this city in 1581, stood a little west of it.</P>
<P>BY the charter of <HI>Roger Lacy</HI> to the abby of <HI>Norton,</HI> it ap∣pears, that there was a monastery in the parish of St. <HI>Michael</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Dugdale Monast</HI> ii. 185.</NOTE> which he grants to the canons of the former. We are left igno∣rant of the order it was of.</P>
<P>IN <HI>Trinity</HI> parish stood a house of <HI>Franciscan</HI> or <HI>Grey friers,</HI> which bishop <HI>Tanner</HI> conjectures might have been as antient as the time of <HI>Henry</HI> III. The site was granted to one <HI>John Cokke.</HI> I imagine that this stood in the <HI>Yatch field,</HI> near the place occu∣pied by the new linnen-hall. By <HI>Speed</HI>'s plan of <HI>Chester,</HI> it ap∣pears that there was a church there in his time; and to this day painted tiles and painted glass, reliques of ecclesiastical sinery, are still dug up.</P>
<P><PB N="186" REF="209"/>IN the parish of St. <HI>Martin</HI>'s<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rather is that of <HI>Trinity;</HI> 9 <HI>s.</HI> 2 ½ <HI>d.</HI> is paid at the audit for the site of it.</NOTE> was a monastery of preach∣ing or <HI>Black friers,</HI> said by <HI>Speed</HI> to have been founded by a bishop of <HI>Chester,</HI> meaning (as <HI>Tanner</HI> observes) of <HI>Lichfield.</HI> This, as well as the other religious house in this parish, was granted to the same <HI>John Cokke.</HI> Part of this house, and its fine vaults, are occupied by <HI>Hanry Hesketh</HI> esquire.</P>
<P>ST. JOHN'S,<NOTE PLACE="marg">ST. JOHN'S.</NOTE> which lies without the walls on the east-side of the city, was once a collegiate church, reputed to have been founded by king <HI>Ethelred</HI> in 689, on being admonished by a vision to build it on the spot where he should find a white hind. After the ruin of the city by the <HI>Danes,</HI> the church was restored by his namesake, earl of <HI>Mercia,</HI> in 906; and was in the next century repaired and endowed by earl <HI>Leofric.</HI> A monastery was also founded here; for historians record, that king <HI>Edgar</HI> was rowed from his palace to the monastery of St. <HI>John.</HI> The Doomsday book also mentions the monastery of St. <HI>Mary,</HI> near the same church. This, besides, was the cathedral during the short time the see was removed from <HI>Lichfield</HI> by bishop <HI>Peter.</HI> In an old plan of it appears a house called the bi∣shop's.</P>
<P>AT the dissolution, here was found a dean and seven pre∣bendaries or canons (in the collation of the bishop of <HI>Lichfield</HI>); seven vicars, two clerks, four choiristers, sextons, and other servants; most of whose houses are distinguished in the same plan. Their yearly revenue, after reprisals, was only 27 <HI>l.</HI> 17 <HI>s.</HI> 4 <HI>d.</HI> The site of the college, and some part

of the buildings, were granted by queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> to <HI>John Fortescue</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Tanner,</HI> 59.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>ON the east-side of the church-yard stood the chapel of St. <HI>Anne,</HI> belonging to the brethren and sisters of the fraternity of St. <HI>Anne</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Harleian</HI> MSS. N<SUP>o</SUP> 1994. 69.</NOTE>. This in later days was called <HI>Cholmondly</HI> hall; but is now totally demolished.</P>
<P>ST. JOHN'S, when entire, was a magnificent pile. The tower once stood in the center; but falling down in 1574, was never rebuilt. The chancel was probably demolished at the same time; but at that end are some fine arches, and other remains of antient chapels. Withinside are curious specimens of the clumsy strength of <HI>Saxon</HI> architecture, in the massy columns and round arches which support the body. The tower is now placed at the west-end; and has on one side the legend, repre∣sented by the figure of a man and a hind.</P>
<P>ON the south-side of the church-yard, impending over a high cliff, supposed to be the <HI>Radeclive</HI> of the Doomsday book, is a small antient building, probably a chapel, called the <HI>Anchori∣tage,</HI> placed over the retreat of some holy hermits. This might have been their place of sepulture; for in the live rock were found two bodies deposited in coffin-shaped cavities. This might have been the place, where legend says that <HI>Harold,</HI> the last <HI>Saxon</HI> king, ended his days; for it was long believed by the <HI>English,</HI> that he escaped from the battle of <HI>Hastings,</HI> and finished his life in retirement.</P>
<P>DOCTOR TANNER supposes, that the convent of <HI>Benedictine</HI> nuns, dedicated to St. <HI>Mary,</HI> originated either from the mo∣nastery
<PB N="188" REF="211"/>
of St. <HI>John,</HI> or was a relique of one of the old nunneries be∣longing to St. <HI>Werburgh.</HI> This, perhaps, may have been the case; for, from a charter preserved by <HI>Dugdale,</HI> it appears, that <HI>Ranale the second,</HI> earl of <HI>Chester,</HI> had obtained <HI>for the nuns of</HI> Chester, certain crofts from <HI>Hugh Fitzoliver,</HI> for them to build a church and convent on; which implies that there had been nuns in the city previous to his grant<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sciatis me dedisse, et in perpetuam elemosynam concepisse D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o et sanctae <HI>Mariae</HI> et MONIALIBUS <HI>Cestriae,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Monasticon,</HI> i. 507.</NOTE>. I find also, that <HI>Edward</HI> the black prince had been a benefactor; for there is mention of a charter of his to the nuns, granted in the 32d of his father's reign<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Herleian</HI> MSS. N<SUP>o</SUP> 2057. 36.</NOTE>. This was suppressed (with the other religious houses) in 1537. At that time <HI>Elizabeth Grosvenour</HI> was prioress, who made a surrender of the house, and had a pension for life of twenty pounds; and eleven of the sisters had also pensions, from 4 <HI>l.</HI> to 1 <HI>l.</HI> 6 <HI>s.</HI> 8 <HI>d.</HI> each. The site was granted, in the 33d of <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. to the <HI>Urian Breretons,</HI> senior and junior. The revenues were, according to <HI>Dugdale,</HI> 66 <HI>l.</HI> 18. <HI>s.</HI> 4 <HI>d.;</HI> to <HI>Speed</HI> 99 <HI>l.</HI> 16 <HI>s.</HI> 2 <HI>d.</HI> I have a ground-plot of this nunnery; by which it appears to have been a compact but small building. The church was twenty-two yards long and fifteen broad; and supported in the middle by a row of pillars. The chapel was nine yards by four three-quarters; the cloisters thirty yards by twenty-one. It stood in the nursery-garden on the west-side of the city, still called the <HI>Nun's garden;</HI> where vestiges of the walls and arches are yet remaining.</P>
<P><PB N="189" REF="212"/>WITHOUT the <HI>North-gate</HI> stood a hospital dedicated to St. <HI>John the Baptist,</HI> and formerly a sanctuary, and endowed with great priveleges. The mastership was granted by <HI>Edward</HI> II. to the prior of <HI>Berkinhead</HI> and his successors; but afterwards disposed of by the crown to secular clergy. The house, at the dissolution, consisted of a chaplain and six poor brethren, whose income, after reprisals, was 13 <HI>l.</HI> 7 <HI>s.</HI> 10 <HI>d</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Tanner,</HI> 64.</NOTE>.

I am told, that a fragment, supposed to be part of this charity, is to be seen in the <HI>Forest street.</HI></P>
<P>THE last antient hospital was instituted for lepers, in the suburbs of <HI>Boughton,</HI> about the beginning of <HI>Edward</HI> II.'s reign; I think, opposite to the place of excution: the burying-ground is still made use of by the parish of St. <HI>Oswald.</HI></P>
<P>THE number of parishes are nine. None of the churches are remarkable, excepting those of St. <HI>Peter</HI>'s and <HI>Trinity;</HI> which are distinguished by their handsome spires. The first was finished in 1489; when the parson and others signalized themselves by eating part of a goose on it, and flinging the rest into the four streets<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>King,</HI> i. 76.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE number of inhabitants, including the suburbs of <HI>Bough∣ton</HI> and <HI>Hanbridge,</HI> are estimated to be fourteen thousand seven hundred and thirteen. The houses are almost entirely situated in a dry sand-stone rock. Whether it be owing to that, the clearness of the air, and the purity of the water, it is certain
<PB N="190" REF="213"/>
that the proportion of death among the inhabitants is only as one to thirty-one: whereas I am informed, by my worthy friend Doctor <HI>Haggarth</HI> of this city, that in <HI>Leeds,</HI> one in twenty-one; in <HI>Northampton</HI> and <HI>Shrewsbury,</HI> one in twenty-six; and in <HI>London,</HI> one in twenty and three-fourths, annually pay the great tribute of nature.</P>
<P>I DO not recollect any thing remarkable on the outside of the walls which has been unnoticed, unless it be the <HI>Rood-eye,</HI> and the adjacent places. The <HI>Dee,</HI> after quitting the contracted pass at the bridge, flows beneath an incurvated clayey cliff; and washes on the right a fine and extensive meadow, long since protected against its ravages by a lofty dike. I imagine, that it lay open to the tides till about the year 1587, when the corporation (to whom it belongs) demised to one <HI>Thomas Lyneal,</HI> servant to Sir <HI>Francis Walsingham,</HI> this pasture for the term of twenty-one years, together with as much land as he could gain to it from the sea. He was also to make at his own costs a quay for boats and barks to unload at full sea, near the water-gate; for which he was at first to have two pence for every vessel pass∣ing by with any lading; but after that, the sum was encreased to four pence: and <HI>Lyneal</HI> was to pay an annual rent of 20 <HI>l.</HI> to the city. At first he met with some obstructions: Sir <HI>Francis</HI> therefore interfered, in order that his servant might proceed without further interruption<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Harleian</HI> MSS. N<SUP>o</SUP> 2082. 31. 34.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE name of this spot is taken from <HI>eye,</HI> its watery situation, and <HI>rood,</HI> the cross which stood there, whose base is still to be

seen. On this place the lusty youth, in former days, exercised themselves in manly sports of the age; in archery, running, leaping, and wrestling; in mock-fights, and gallant and romantic triumphs. From the hints dropt by <HI>Daniel King,</HI> I imagine them to have been of the same nature with those practised by the young men of the metropolis, described by <HI>Fitz-Stephen,</HI> a writer cotemporary with <HI>Henry</HI> II. <Q>The lay sons of the citizens rush out of the gates in shoals, furnished with lances and shields; the younger sort with javelins pointed, but disarmed of their steel; they ape the feats of war, and act the sham-fight. Part took the field well mounted. The generous coursers neigh and champ the bit. At length, when the course begins, and the youthful combatants are divided into classes or parties, one body retreats, and another pursues without being able to overtake them; while, in another quarter, the pursuers overtake the foe, unhorse them, and pass them many a length. The elders of the city and the fathers of the parties, and the rich and the wealthy, come into the field on horseback to behold the exercises</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide <HI>Fitz-Stephen</HI>'s Deser, <HI>Lend,</HI> translated by an Antiquary, 1772, 46, 7, 8.</NOTE>.

<P>A STANDARD was the prize of emulation in the sports cele∣brated on the <HI>Rood-eye</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Which was won in 1578 by sheriff <HI>Montford,</HI> on <HI>Shrove-Tuesday.</HI></NOTE>: but in the year 1609 the amusements took a new form; and under the reign of the peaceful <HI>James,</HI> the youthful cavaliers layed aside their mimic war, and began that species of horsemanship which the romantic philosopher, lord <HI>Herbert,</HI> thought unworthy of a man of honor; "for," says he, 'the exercise I do not approve, is the running of horses, there 'being much cheating in that kind.</P>
<P>THE first prizes we hear of, after the suppression of the tri∣umph, were a bell and bowl, to be run for on St. <HI>George</HI>'s day; which were provided in 1609 by Mr. <HI>Robert Amery,</HI> formerly sheriff of the city, and were brought down to the <HI>Rood-eye</HI> with great solemnity. This seems to have been the origin of the plate given by the city, and annually run for on the same day,
<PB N="193" REF="216"/>
to the present time. A bell was a common prize: a little golden bell was the reward of victory in 1607, at the races near <HI>York;</HI> whence came the proverb for success of any kind, <HI>to bear the bell.</HI></P>
<P>AT one end of the <HI>Rood-eye</HI> stands the <HI>House of Industry;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">POOR-HOUSE.</NOTE> a large and useful building, founded in 1757, by money raised by the city on life-annuities, for several improvements within its li∣berties. Here the poor are provided for in a fit manner, and to the great ease of the parishes; who are relieved from the bur∣den of a numerous poor, who were too idle to work, and too proud to enter into this comfortable <HI>Asylum.</HI> Those of the parish of <HI>Hawarden</HI> are also sent here, by virtue of an agree∣ment made between the governors of this charity and the over∣seers of the poor of that parish. The inmates contribute, by some coarse linen manufactures, towards their support.</P>
<P>A LITTLE beyond this building are the quays,<NOTE PLACE="marg">QUAYS.</NOTE> cranes, ware∣houses, and other requisites for carrying on the naval trade of this city. These are opposite to the <HI>Water-gate,</HI> and have been much improved of late years; and the intervening space has not long since been filled with a neat street. Ships of 350 tons burden <HI>can</HI> now reach the quays, where the spring-tides rise at a medium fifteen feet: the neap-tides, eight. In the year 1674, this port was in so deplorable a state, and so choaked with sands, that a vessel of twenty tons could not arrive here; but the ships were obliged to lie under <HI>Neston,</HI> ten miles distant; which gave rise to the assemblage of houses called <HI>Parkgate,</HI> built on the shore beneath that town. A quay, called the <HI>New quay,</HI> (now in ruins) was erected near this place in the begin∣ning
<PB N="194" REF="217"/>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Harleaan</HI> MSS. N<SUP>o</SUP> 2003. 39.</NOTE> of the last century, for the conveniency of loading and unloading the vessels trading with <HI>Chester;</HI> and the goods were carried to and from the city by land. The misfortune of the port of <HI>Chester</HI> at length gave rise to the prosperity of <HI>Le∣verpool,</HI> about this time a very inconsiderable place. It now began to discover its own advantages of situation; and quickly emerged from its despicable state to its present flourishing con∣dition.</P>
<P>IN 1674,<NOTE PLACE="marg">New Cut.</NOTE> some friend to the former prevaled on Mr. <HI>Andrew Yarranton,</HI> a gentleman extremely conversant in the commercial advantages of this island, to make a survey of the river <HI>Dee</HI> and its estuary. He drew a plan, formed the project of a new chan∣nel, a scheme for recovering from the sea a large tract of land, and restoring the antient navigation even to the present quays: and this he got to be presented to the duke of <HI>York,</HI> the patron, at that time, of all useful undertakings. He also suggested the idea of a canal from the collieries at <HI>Aston</HI> near <HI>Hawarden;</HI> which was to drop into this new channel, and facilitate the carriage of coal up to the city<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>Andrew Yarranton's England</HI>'s Improvements by sea and land, &amp;c. to, <HI>London,</HI> 1677. His plan for that of the <HI>Dee,</HI> is at p. 192.</NOTE>. Future times had the advantage of his inventive genius. Both plans were brought into execution with∣out any great deviation from Mr. <HI>Yarranton</HI>'s project. His new cut was to end opposite to <HI>Flint;</HI> the present opens opposite to <HI>Wepra,</HI> on this side of <HI>Flint.</HI> Sir <HI>John Glynne</HI>'s little canal approaches the <HI>Dee,</HI> about two miles below the city,
<PB N="195" REF="218"/>
Mr. <HI>Yarranton</HI>'s coal canal was to fall into the <HI>Dee</HI> near to <HI>Flint.</HI></P>
<P>AN act of parlement was obtained for the recovering and preserving the navigation of the river, for settling the duties on ships, and for the establishing two ferries for the conve∣niency of travellers into the county of <HI>Flint.</HI> Other acts were passed in the years 1732, 1740, 43, 1752; and the works were begun with vigor. The project was carried on by subscription; and the adventurers were to be rewarded by the lands they were empowered to gain on both sides, from <Q>the <HI>white sands</HI> or the sea from <HI>Chester;</HI> and between the county of <HI>Cheshire,</HI> on the north-side, and the county of <HI>Flint</HI> on the fouth-side; being sands, soil, and ground not bearing grass.</Q> Party contests at first filled the subscriptions: zeal for the house of <HI>Hanover</HI> was at that time mixed, in this city, with zeal for its commercial interest; but in a little time it was discovered to be the <HI>madness of many, but the gain of few.</HI> The expences proved enormous; multitudes were obliged to sell out at above ninety <HI>per cent.</HI> loss; and, their shares being bought by persons of more wealth and foresight, at length the plan was brought to a considerable degree of utility; and a sine canal formed, guarded by vast banks, in which the river is consined for the space of ten miles; along which ships of three hundred and fifty tons burden may safely be brought up to the quays. Much land has been gained from the sea; and good farms now appear in places not long since possessed by the unruly element.</P>
<P>I REMEMBER an almost useless tide flowing about the water-tower,
<PB N="196" REF="219"/>
the antient channel of the <HI>Dee</HI> flowing under <HI>Blacon</HI> point; and the access to the county of <HI>Flint,</HI> on this side, open only at the recess of tides, and annually occasioning the loss of multitudes of lives. Two ferries are established at fit places. The lower is the proper passage for travellers by <HI>Holyhead</HI> into the kingdom of <HI>Ireland;</HI> and calls aloud for the aid of a turn∣pike, to render it at all times pervious; or the road may be con∣tinued to <HI>Saltney,</HI> along the flat, so as to fall into the other turn∣pike on the marsh.</P>
<P>I SHALL now take a short view of the trade of this city,<NOTE PLACE="marg">TRADE.</NOTE> as it stood in the years 1771 and 1776. I bring the last into sight, in order to shew how far this port has been affected by the commotions of our <HI>American</HI> subjects; and oppose it to the commerce of 1771, when it appears to have been in its meri∣dian, since the restoration of the channel. In that year were entered inwards</P>
<P>297 coasting-vessels; 19 of which were laden with groceries, and other goods from <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>526 coast ships outwards; of these 23 came from the port of <HI>London,</HI> and were laden here with lead, iron cannon, two thousand tons of cheese, and other goods.</P>
<P>IN the same year, 95 vessels were entered inwards from foreign parts; and 216 entered inwards from <HI>Ireland, Portugal, Spain, Italy,</HI> and <HI>America.</HI></P>
<P>FROM <HI>Norway</HI> and the <HI>Baltic,</HI> are imported timber, flax, tal∣low, hemp, iron, and deals.</P>
<P>FROM <HI>Leghorn,</HI> large quantities of kid and lamb skins; which are manufactured by the glovers, after being dressed here.
<PB N="197" REF="220"/>
This, in fact, is the only manufacture which the city can boast of. I find, that in the reigns of queen <HI>Elizabeth, James</HI> I. and the be∣ginning of that of <HI>Charles</HI> I. here was a vast trade in calves skins. In the first of those monopolizing times, the queen grants one <HI>Arthur Balsano</HI> a licence to export 6000 dickers of leather of calves skins, ten dozens to every dicker, for seven years, paying five shillings <HI>per</HI> dicker. <HI>James</HI> I. granted to <HI>James Maxwel</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> a licence to export 18,000 dickers, for the same duty, and for twenty-one years; and this was afterwards confirmed to him by <HI>Charles</HI> I<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Harleian</HI> MSS. N<SUP>o</SUP> 2004. 4, 5, 16.</NOTE>. This <HI>Maxwel</HI> was one of the grooms of the bed∣chamber to his majesty; and in the preceding reign, by a piece of insolence to a gentleman of the inns of court, brought on him the resentment of the <HI>English;</HI> and was obliged to atone for it by making due submission. The first grant might be made to him by <HI>James,</HI> to make amends for the mortifications he had un∣dergone.</P>
<P>FROM <HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>Portugal</HI> are imported great quantities of cork, fruit, oil of olives, nuts, <HI>Barilla</HI> ashes, and raisins; and several hundred tons of wine from <HI>Portugal;</HI> which last form the greatest foreign import of this city.</P>
<P>WHILE the trade with <HI>America</HI> was open, fish and oil were brought from <HI>Newfoundland;</HI> and a small trade was carried on with <HI>Caroling.</HI></P>
<P>THE exports this year were upwards of 6000 chaldrons of coal from the <HI>Cheshire</HI> and <HI>Flintshire</HI> collieries (which lie within this port); 1000 tons of lead; 300 of lead ore; 300 of oak
<PB N="198" REF="221"/>
bark; all these to foreign parts. Besides 3470 tons of lead, and 431 of lead ore, sent coastways; that is, to the ports of <HI>London</HI> and <HI>Leverpool, vae! nimium vicina!</HI> for the purpose of re-ex∣portation.</P>
<P>IN 1776, 208 coasting-vessels were entered inwards, and 619 outwards.</P>
<P>166 ships entered inwards from foreign parts, including those trading between <HI>Dublin</HI> and <HI>Parkgate;</HI> and 131 outwards. The following table will shew the division of the commerce.</P>

<P>2877 chaldrons of coal, 1184 tons of lead, and 168 of lead ore, were sent abroad; but so exhausted are our oak-trees, that only 18 tons of bark were shipped. 2813 tons of lead, and 431 of lead ore, were sent coastways.</P>
<P>FROM the table of entries it appears, that the great trade of this city is with <HI>Ireland;</HI> which receives annnally from hence <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>

a magazine) large quantities of hops, woollen cloths, worsted stuffs, hosiery, fustians, <HI>Manchester</HI> goods, cheese, wrought-iron, iron great guns, hardware, bound and unbound books, carpets, flint-glass, wrought silks, and great quantities of foreign goods sent from <HI>London</HI> by land, and shipped from this port.</P>
<P>IN return, it imports from <HI>Ireland,</HI> at the <HI>Midsummer</HI> and <HI>Michaelmas</HI> fairs, upwards of 1000 boxes and packs of linen cloth, containing 25,000 pieces at lest: besides 300 boxes or packs imported into <HI>Leverpool,</HI> and sent across the <HI>Mersey</HI> to <HI>Ince,</HI> from whence they are conveyed in carts to <HI>Chester.</HI> These form all together a million of yards each fair. This trade began no longer ago than the year 1736, in which 449, 654. yards were imported. The importations continually increased till the last year of the late war; from which period it has been on a par.</P>
<P>IRELAND also sends considerable quantities of lamb-skins, wool, linen and bay-yarn, tallow, hides, butter, feathers, and quills, ox bones and hoofs, glue, sheep and cat guts; calve-velves, pro∣visions, and live cattle.</P>
<P>THE number of ships belonging to this port shew the uncom∣mercial genius of its inhabitants; there being only twenty-two in the foreign trade, containing in all 1449 tons, and 169 men: and 13 in the coast-trade, whose tonnage is 680 tons, and num∣ber of men 58: yet the port extends, on the <HI>Cheshire</HI> side of the estuary, as far as the end of <HI>Wiral;</HI> and on the <HI>Flintshire,</HI> to the <HI>Ver-rýd,</HI> or the mouth of the <HI>Clwyd.</HI></P>
<P>THERE was lately a very fair prospect of adding much to the trade of the city, by an i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>land navigation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CANAL.</NOTE> which was begun
<PB N="200" REF="223"/>
with great spirit a few years ago. It was to run through the county beneath <HI>Beeston</HI> castle, and to terminate near <HI>Middlewich.</HI> Another branch was to extend to <HI>Namptwich.</HI> One mouth opens into the <HI>Dee,</HI> below the water-tower. A fine bason is formed, into which the boats are to descend, by means of five successive locks, beneath the northern walls of the city, cut in the live rock. A few miles of this design are completed: but, by an unhappy miscalculation of expence, and by unforeseen difficul∣ties occurring in the execution, such enormous charges were in∣curred, as to put a stop for the present to all proceedings. The other branch, which was to extend towards <HI>Middlewich,</HI> was to end within a limited distance from the great canal between the <HI>Trent</HI> and <HI>Mersey</HI> navigation. The great objects were the salt and cheese trade; and coal for the supply of the interior parts of <HI>Cheshire,</HI> from the vast collieries in <HI>Staffordshire.</HI> Share also in the exportation of hard-ware, earthen-ware, and all the manu∣factures of the internal part of the kingdom within its reach, might have been reasonably expected.</P>
<P>THE idea of a canal along the dead flat between <HI>Chester</HI> and <HI>Ince</HI> has been long since conceived, by persons very conversant in the nature of the trade of this city. One mouth might have opened into the <HI>Dee</HI> in the place of the present; another near <HI>Ince,</HI> which would create a ready intercourse with <HI>Leverpool,</HI> the <HI>Weever,</HI> and the salt-works and great dairies on that river; with <HI>Warrington,</HI> and with the flourishing town of <HI>Manchester,</HI> and a numerous set of places within reach of the <HI>Mersey,</HI> and of the canal belonging to that useful Peer, the duke of <HI>Bridgewater,</HI> to which the greatest of our inland navigations is connected.

This little cut the city might, and still may, enjoy unenvied, un∣rivalled; and, what is a material consideration, the distance is trifling (seven miles<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">According to <HI>Burdet</HI>'s map.</NOTE>); the expences small, and the profits to the undertakers great.</P>
<P>ON leaving the city, I repassed <HI>Hanbridge;</HI> and at the may pole took the left-hand road, which is a continuation of the <HI>Roman</HI> road from the river. The strait direction is the only proof of its antiquity, till it falls into the fields on the left, where its tract is often distinguishable by certain ridges or ele∣vated spots. The farmer also, in digging, often falls on adventi∣tious matters; such as gravel, and remains of pavements. It points towards <HI>Eccleston,</HI> near which are the reliques of a mount; the site, perhaps, of a small castlet. It passes through <HI>Eaton</HI> park, and crosses the <HI>Dee</HI> at <HI>Oldford.</HI></P>
<P>THE village of <HI>Eccleston</HI> is prettily seated near the <HI>Dee,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">ECCLESTON.</NOTE> and commands a view of the towers and spires of <HI>Chester</HI> rising above the wooded banks. The most extensive prospect is from a bench on <HI>Eccleston</HI> hill, on the road-side; which takes in the vast en∣virons of <HI>Wales, Cheshire,</HI> and part of <HI>Shropshire,</HI> forming a n admirable composition of rich cultivation, bounded by hills of various forms.</P>
<P>ECCLESTON retains the same name which it had at the Conquest. It was held at that time by <HI>Gilbert de Venables,</HI> from <HI>Hag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Lupus;</HI> before that event, by <HI>Edwin</HI> a freeman. On the demesne land were two servants, four villeyns, and a boor, a boat and a net. Part of the place afterwards fell to the <HI>Vernors</HI> of <HI>Kinder∣len;</HI> and finally, by a late purchase, was added by the family of
<PB N="202" REF="225"/>
the <HI>Grosvenours</HI> to their antient property in this parish. The church is a rectory dedicated to St. <HI>Mary.</HI></P>
<P>A LITTLE farther is <HI>Eaton,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">EATOS.</NOTE> or the hamlet on the water; a name the most common of any in <HI>England.</HI> At the Conquest, here was a fishery, which employed six fishermen, and yielded a thousand salmon. This fishery has long since ceased; but dur∣ing its existence, the minister of <HI>Eccleston</HI> clamed the twentieth fish. The seat of the antient family of the <HI>Gresvenours</HI> lies in this township; a brick house, built about the latter end of the last century. The <HI>Gresvenours</HI> came in with the Conqueror, and took their name from the office they held in the <HI>Norman</HI> court, that of grand huntsman. Their first settlement in this county was, <HI>Over Lostock,</HI> bestowed by <HI>Hugh Lupus</HI> on his great nephew <HI>Robert le Gresvenour.</HI> In 1234, <HI>Richard le Grosvenour</HI> purchased and fixed his seat at <HI>Hulme:</HI> but in the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> VI. by the marriage of <HI>Rawlin</HI> or <HI>Ralph Gresvenour</HI> with <HI>Jean</HI> daughter of <HI>John Eaton</HI> of <HI>Eaton,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> it was transferred to this place While chivalry was the passion of the times, few families shon in so distinguished a manner: none shewed equal spirit in vin∣dicating their right to their honors. Witness the famous cause between Sir <HI>Robert le Gresvenour</HI> with Sir <HI>Richard le Scrope,</HI> plain∣tiff, about a coat of arms, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> one land, or;</HI> tried before the high constable and high marshal of <HI>England,</HI> in the reign <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Richard</HI> II. and lasted three years. Kings, princes of the blood and most of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> bore witness in this important affair.

In one window, over the pew of the respectable family of <HI>Barnston,</HI> is some very beautiful painted glass, of a commander in his tent, with a truncheon in his hand, surrounded with the military instruments in use during the reign of <HI>Charles</HI> I. Around these are sixteen elegant figures of different ranks of soldiery, as low as the drummer, with their respective badges. Over the heads of the officers are coats of arms: over that of the commander are those of <HI>Gamul;</HI> and seem intended to preserve the memory of Sir <HI>Francis Gamul</HI> baronet, the active mayor of <HI>Chester</HI> during the civil wars. Over the heads of three others are the arms of the <HI>Grosvenours,</HI> the <HI>Mainwarings,</HI> and the <HI>Barndistons;</HI> three loyalists, who served in the same cause: <HI>Roger Grosvenour;</HI> Sir <HI>William Mainwaring,</HI> who was slain in defence of <HI>Chester;</HI> and <HI>William Barndiston</HI> of <HI>Chirton,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> who died in 1664.</P>

<P>THE poor reliques of the castle are seated close to the river; and are insulated by a vast foss cut through a deep bed of soft red stone;<NOTE PLACE="marg">CASTLE.</NOTE> which seems originally to have been thus quarried for the building of the castle. This fortress consisted of five bastions, and the work cut into that form, to serve as a base to as many towers. An antient survey I met with in the <HI>Museum,</HI> among the <HI>Harleian</HI> MSS. taken in 1620 by <HI>John Norden,</HI> when it was entire, will give a true idea of this curious structure. It had been defended in three parts by the great chasm formed by the quarry; on the fourth by the <HI>Dee,</HI> into which jutted a great quay, still to be seen in very dry seasons; for it has long since been covered by the encroachment of the river.</P>
<P>ORIGINALLY this place had been a small out-post to <HI>Deva.</HI> Slopes, and other now almost obsolete works, may be seen near the castle, and on the opposite side of the water: and coins have been found here, that put the matter out of doubt. I have seen some of <HI>Antoninus, Galienus, Constantinus,</HI> and <HI>Constantius.</HI> I conjecture that the <HI>Roman</HI> name had been <HI>Castra Legionis,</HI> and the <HI>Welsh, Castell Llcon,</HI> or the castle of the legion; because it was garrisoned by a detachment of the legion stationed at <HI>Chester.</HI> The <HI>English</HI> borderers might easily mistake <HI>Lleon</HI> for the plural of <HI>Llew,</HI> which signifies a lion, and so call it the <HI>castle of Lions;</HI> as we find it styled when it came into possession of earl <HI>Warren</HI> and his successors.</P>

<P><PB N="211" REF="235"/>HAVING now brought the succession to the required period, I shall only say, that <HI>Gryffydd,</HI> the third son, was suffered to enjoy his portion of <HI>Glyndyfrdwy;</HI> from whom sprung OWEN, the great revenger of the wrongs of his family: and the fourth son, <HI>Owen,</HI> received for his share, <HI>Cynllaeth.</HI> This afterwards de∣volved to <HI>Gryffydd,</HI> father of <HI>Glyndwr.</HI></P>
<P>THE barbarity of the two guardians, so far from being pu∣nished by their master, was rewarded. <HI>Warren</HI> had the grant of <HI>Dinas Brân</HI> and all <HI>Bromfield</HI> confirmed to him, dated from <HI>Rudland, October</HI> 7th, 1281<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">AYLOFF's Rotuli <HI>Walliae,</HI> 81.</NOTE>; <HI>Mortimer</HI> that of <HI>Chirk.</HI> The for∣mer began immediately to secure his ill-gotten possessions by building <HI>Holt Castle;</HI> but dying, left the finishing of it to his son <HI>William.</HI> Before this grant, a family of the name of <HI>Holt,</HI> held this place; I suppose under its lord paramount. These estates continued in the family till 1347, when, on the death of <HI>John</HI> earl <HI>Warren,</HI> they devolved to <HI>Edward Fitz∣alan</HI> earl of <HI>Arundel,</HI> in right of his wife <HI>Alice,</HI> sister to the for∣mer. <HI>Warren</HI> had been divorced from his wife <HI>Joan de Baars,</HI> and had obtained from <HI>Edward</HI> II. a grant of his <HI>Welsh</HI> estates, and others in <HI>Surrey</HI> and <HI>Sussex,</HI> in favor of <HI>John</HI> and <HI>Thomas,</HI> sons of his by <HI>Maud de Nereford,</HI> to whom he had been contracted before his marriage with <HI>Joan.</HI> These children, probably, died without issue; the estates reverting, as he had in such a case provided, to his own right heirs<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Dugdale Baron. i. 82.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THEY continued with the <HI>Fitzalans</HI> during three generations. <HI>Richard</HI> II. probably seized on them after the execution of <HI>Richard</HI> earl of <HI>Arundel;</HI> for we find that unhappy prince had lodged in <HI>Holt Castle,</HI> during his <HI>Irish</HI> expedition, jewels to the value of

<P>HENRY VIII. bestowed this lordship on his natural son <HI>Henry Fitzroy</HI> duke of <HI>Richmond;</HI> and had possession given him at its capital of <HI>Holt,</HI> in 1534, by the duke of <HI>Norfolk</HI> and others<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">King, ii, 195.</NOTE>.

<P>IN 1643, <HI>Holt Castle</HI> was in the hands of the crown; but in that year was feized for the use of the parlement, by Sir <HI>Wil∣liam Brereton</HI> and Sir <HI>Thomas Middhton</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Whitelock, 77. <HI>Idem,</HI> 192. 201.</NOTE>.

<P>THE lordship is at present in the crown, under the direction of the steward of <HI>Bromfield</HI> and <HI>Yale;</HI> an office in his majesty's disposal: but a grant of the minerals (the far more valuable part) was made to the <HI>Grosvenour</HI> family in the reign of <HI>Charles</HI> I. subject to the annual payment of twenty shillings. An attempt was made by king <HI>William</HI> to alienate these important do∣mains in favor of the earl of <HI>Portland,</HI> and his heirs for ever; but on a vigorous representation of the illegality, but par∣ticularly on the noble speech<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot"><HI>British</HI> Biogr. vii. app. 141.</NOTE> of <HI>Robert Price</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> after∣wards baron of the exchequer, his majesty thought fit to with∣draw the grant already made out in the treasury.

the prince on his accession, in old times, in cattle; but after its conquest, changed into money. It amounted to about five thousand pounds.

<P>ON leaving <HI>Holt,</HI> I returned over the bridge; and, passing along a portion of CHESHIRE, in a flat country, with a pleasing view of the <HI>Broxton</HI> hills on the left, I reached the site of <HI>Shocklach</HI> castle. This, with great part of the antient hundred of <HI>Dudestan,</HI> was held after the Conquest by <HI>Robert Fitzbugh,</HI> from <HI>Hugh Lupus.</HI> It belonged to the barony of Malpas; but on the division of it, one part came to <HI>John de Sutton</HI> baron of Dudley, the other to <HI>Urien de Sancto Petro.</HI> What is remarkable, it was held of queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> as of her ma∣nor of <HI>East Greenwich.</HI> Nothing, excepting a foss, marks the place of this fortress.

<P>AT a small distance from <HI>Shocklach</HI> castle, I entered <HI>Maelor Saesneg,</HI> a hundred of FLINTSHIRE, disjoined from the rest of the county. At the time of the making of the, Doomsday book, the lands about <HI>Worthenbury, Overton,</HI>

<P><PB N="216" REF="241"/>THE lordship or superiority of the hundred was granted (I be∣lieve) by <HI>Henry</HI> IV. to Sir <HI>John Stanley</HI> knight, and continued in his family till the 41st of <HI>Elizabeth;</HI> when <HI>William</HI> earl of <HI>Derby</HI> devised it to Sir <HI>Randle Brerelon;</HI> and it has since devolved to Sir <HI>Walden Hanmer</HI> baronet, and <HI>Philip Lloyd Fletcher</HI> esquire.</P>
<P>THIS part of <HI>Flintshire</HI> is under the same government as the rest; excepting the obligation of attending the county courts, which is dispensed with by reason of its distance from the towns where they are held. It has also a coroner of its own; but eli∣gible by the county at large.</P>

Numbers of houses are scattered over the common for their reception. This tract, till of late years, had the ill-fortune to be extra-parochial: at first, either because it was in the hands of irreligious or careless owners, or was situated in forest or desert places<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Blackstone, 4 to, i. 113.</NOTE>, it never was united to any parish. The inhabitants, therefore, considered themselves as be∣yond the reach of law, resisted all government; and even opposed the excise laws, till they were forced to submit, but not without bloodshed on the occasion. The very name of the place speaks the manners of the dwellers, <HI>Threap-wood,</HI> derived from the <HI>Anglo-Saxon Threapian,</HI> to <HI>threap</HI> (a word still in use); signifying to persist in a fact or argument, be it right or wrong. It is seated between the parishes of <HI>Malpas, Hanmer,</HI> and <HI>Worthenbury;</HI> but belonged to none, till it was, by the late militia acts, decreed to be in the last. Still doubts arise about execution of several laws within this precinct. It is to be hoped, that legislature will take an opportunity of rendering the magisterial power as valid here as in other places; especially when it is to be considered, that there are to the amount of two hundred and sixty-seven inha∣bitants, who want instruction in the doctrine of universal submis∣sion to law.</P>

The part about the little town of <HI>Hanmer</HI> is extremely beautiful; varied with a lake of fifty acres, bounded on all sides with small cultivated eminences, embellished with woods. The town, church, and the chief seat of the family of the <HI>Hanmers,</HI> a modern brick house, adorn one part; and on the opposite side of the water, on the sire of the old house of <HI>Greddington,</HI> another seat is pro∣jected by that eminent lawyer, <HI>Lloyd Kenyon,</HI> esquire.</P>
<P>THE church is a very handsome embattled building,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHURCH.</NOTE> of the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> VII. in whose time numbers of churches were re-built alter the long desolation of civil war.

I am assured by Mr. STUART, that this kind visits <HI>Attica</HI> in vast flocks every spring, and breeds there. It is no wonder that the <HI>Athenian</HI> goddess should have this bird as her conco∣mitant, being so very common there. It is very frequently ex∣pressed on the <HI>Athenian</HI> coins and sculptures; and I have seen it placed on the hand of a statue of hers, in the noble collection belonging to <HI>William Weddel</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> at <HI>Newby</HI> in <HI>Yorkshire.</HI></P>
<P>WITHIN a small distance from <HI>Overton,</HI> I entered the county of SALOP or SHROPSHIRE, at <HI>Trench-lane,</HI> once infamous for its depth and badness. This county was peopled by the <HI>Cornavii;</HI> and, till the time of <HI>Offa,</HI> was divided between the princes of <HI>Powys</HI> and the <HI>Mercian</HI> king∣dom: but <HI>Offa,</HI> after his expulsion of the <HI>Welsh</HI> from their an∣tient seat of <HI>Pengwern</HI> or <HI>Shrewsbury,</HI> added their part to his dominions. At the Conquest, it was possessed by the brave
<PB N="230" REF="260"/>
<HI>Edwin,</HI> the last earl of <HI>Mercia.</HI> On his death, it was bestowed by the Conqueror on <HI>Roger de Montgomery,</HI> a potent <HI>Norman,</HI> the first earl of <HI>Arundel</HI> and <HI>Shrewsbury.</HI></P>
<P>THE country,<NOTE PLACE="marg">ELLESMERE.</NOTE> for the greatest part of the way to <HI>Ellesmere,</HI> is flat, dirty, and unpleasing. On the approach to the town, be∣comes more agreeable; and about it, breaks into most beauti∣ful risings, fertile, and finely wooded; the bottoms are indeed destitute of rivers; but frequently filled with little lakes, called here <HI>meres,</HI> elegantly bordered by the cultivated hills. It is singular that none of them are the parents of streams; their encrease from rains and springs, and their loss by exhalations, keep such equal pace!</P>
<P>ELLESMERE is a town seated on a lake of a hundred and one acres in dimensions; and whose greatest depth is twenty-six yards; well stocked with fish.</P>
<P>THE environs have two advantages superior to the other lakes. A good town borders on one side: the fine park of <HI>Ockle,</HI> or <HI>Ottley,</HI> is a great ornament to another. The property of the water is in the duke of <HI>Bridgewater.</HI></P>
<P>THE town is of <HI>Saxon</HI> origin, and takes its name from the water; which was called <HI>Aelsmere,</HI> or the <HI>greatest mere,</HI> being the chief in this part of the county. The place has little to boast of except its situation. The principal trade is that of malt; the barley of the neighborhood being remarkably good.</P>
<P>THE castle stood on a vast artificial mount on a rising ground,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CASTLE.</NOTE> with three great ditches on the more accessible side. At present not a vestige is to be seen; the top being formed into a bowl∣ing-green, that may vie with any in <HI>England</HI> for the elegance

and extent of inland prospect; of the lake beneath; of the rich country and woods surrounding the town. At a distance, <HI>Chester</HI> and the <HI>Broxton</HI> hills; <HI>Wrexham</HI> and the <HI>Caergwrle</HI> mountains; Castle <HI>Dinas Brân,</HI> and the <HI>Berwyn</HI> alps; and some of those of <HI>Merionethshire; Llanymynach</HI> hill, the <HI>Breyddin, Pimhill, Cleehill,</HI> and the noted <HI>Wrekin.</HI></P>
<P>I CANNOT trace the founder of the castle, nor yet the time of its destruction. The place was possessed, as I before said, by <HI>Edwin</HI> immediately before the Conquest; and on that event, by <HI>Roger de Montgomery.</HI></P>
<P>IN 1177, it was transferred to a prince of <HI>North Wales. Henry</HI> II. in that year, assembled a council at <HI>Oxford,</HI> and, among other regulations for the security of the kingdom, bestowed on <HI>David ap Owen</HI> his natural sister <HI>Emma,</HI> with the lordship of <HI>Ellesmere</HI> as a portion. This the politic monarch did, in hopes of retaining the affections of <HI>David,</HI> and to prevent a breach with the <HI>Welsh;</HI> who gave him such great disturbance, and so often baffled his greatest endeavors to subdue them during the reign of <HI>Owen Gwynedd</HI> father to <HI>David.</HI> This alliance answered his purpose; for the <HI>English</HI> remained unmolested during the life of that prince.</P>
<P>AFTER his decease, <HI>Robert Lupus</HI> held, by his bailiff, this manor.</P>
<P>AFTER this, it came a second time into the hands of a prince of <HI>Wales.</HI> King <HI>John,</HI> by grant dated from <HI>Dover, April</HI> 16th 1204, bestowed it, with <HI>Joan,</HI> his natural child by <HI>Agatha</HI> daughter of <HI>Robert Ferrers</HI> earl of <HI>Derby,</HI> on <HI>Llewelyn ap Jorwerth.</HI> It is probable that <HI>John</HI> hoped, by means of his son-in-law, to ter∣rify
<PB N="232" REF="262"/>
the lord marchers into obedience: but the unfortunate mo∣narch reaped no benefit from the alliance. <HI>Joan</HI> proved un∣faithful to our prince's bed; who hanged <HI>William de Breos,</HI> author of his disgrace, and turned his arms against the <HI>English.</HI> This induced <HI>John</HI> to divest <HI>Llewelyn</HI> of the government of so im∣portant a fortress as a frontier castle; for, by a writ dated from <HI>Warwick,</HI> in the tenth year of his reign, he orders the govern∣nor, <HI>Bartholomew Turol,</HI> to deliver it instantly to <HI>William</HI> earl of <HI>Salusbury</HI> and <HI>Thomas</HI> of <HI>Endinton.</HI> But still left the revenues of the lands to his daughter.</P>
<P>IN the fourth or <HI>Henry</HI> III. or the year 1219, <HI>Roger L'Estrange</HI> yielded to the king the manors of <HI>Colmere</HI> and <HI>Hampton;</HI> but received them again, together with the hundred of <HI>Ellesmere</HI> and its castle; but for life only.</P>
<P>In 1236, or the 21st of the same monarch, it appears that <HI>John L'Estrange</HI> was governor of the castle. Four years after this, <HI>Henry</HI> determined no longer to leave a place of this con∣sequence in the hands of the <HI>Welsh.</HI> Accordingly, we find him obliging <HI>David ap Llewelyn</HI> to make a formal renunciation of this territory, which he cedes for ever. The treaty was dated from <HI>Alnet</HI> on the <HI>Elwy,</HI> on the feast of the decollation of St. <HI>John the Baptist,</HI> in 1240.</P>
<P>IN 1252, the 37th of <HI>Henry</HI> III. the manor and castle of <HI>Ellsmere</HI> were committed to <HI>John de Grey,</HI> paying an annual fine of ten shillings.</P>
<P>IN the 43d year, or 1258, <HI>Peter de Montfort</HI> was governor of the castle. In the 51st, the manor, castle, and hundred were granted to <HI>Hamon L'Estrange</HI> and his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, with a provision</P>

out of the escheat of the manor, castle, and hundred, of a hundred pounds a year. This nobleman took a large share in the barons wars; was excommunicated for his insolence by the archbishop of <HI>Canterbury;</HI> but returning to his allegiance, was employed in places of trust, which he discharged with the ut∣most fidelity. It is said that he purchased the manors of <HI>Coal∣mere</HI> and <HI>Hampton</HI> from <HI>Peter de Montfort,</HI> which he left to his brother Sir <HI>Roger L'Estrange. Edward</HI> I. in the fourth year of his reign, on the surrender of the grant of <HI>Hamon</HI> (which was to him and his heirs) confirmed it anew, on condition he would receive the castle and hundred of <HI>Ellesmere</HI> for life, and the remainder to the king in fee. This <HI>Roger,</HI> by the king's warrant, granted several parcels of the manor to different per∣sons: and about the same time, the wastes and commons were inclosed and converted into freeholds.</P>
<P>In 1320, <HI>Edward</HI> II. on the insurrection of the earl of <HI>Lan∣caster,</HI> appointed <HI>Oliver de Ingehan</HI> governor of the castle. <HI>Ed∣ward</HI> III. in 1329, after causing the encroachments made on this manor to be reduced, bestowed the castle, and the hamlets of <HI>Colmere</HI> and <HI>Hampton,</HI> on Sir <HI>Eubule L'Estrange,</HI> younger son of baron <HI>L'Estrange</HI> of <HI>Knockin.</HI> They continued in his line till 1477, the 17th of <HI>Edward</HI> IV; when, by the marriage of <HI>Joan,</HI> daughter of the last male heir, with <HI>George Stanley,</HI> eldest son to <HI>Thomas</HI> first earl of <HI>Derby,</HI> they were conveyed to that great house, which was possessed of them till 1549, the 42d of <HI>Eliza∣beth;</HI> when <HI>William</HI> earl of <HI>Derby</HI> had licence from the queen to alienate them; which he did, to <HI>Richard Spencer</HI> and <HI>Edward Savage;</HI> and they, to Sir <HI>Thomas Egerton</HI> keeper of the great seal, and afterwards chancellor of <HI>England</HI> and baron of <HI>Ellesmere.</HI>
<PB N="234" REF="265"/>
It is now in possession of his descendant, the duke of <HI>Bridgewater,</HI> who has vast property about the town; but no seat, except a very mean one, called <HI>Birch.</HI></P>
<P>THE church antiently belonged to the knights of St. <HI>John</HI> of <HI>Jerusalem.</HI> It was granted to them by <HI>Llewelyn;</HI> and <HI>Ed∣ward</HI> III. confirmed to their prior the donation. The vica∣rage is in the gift of the duke of <HI>Bridgewater.</HI> The chapels of <HI>Cockshute, Dudleston,</HI> and <HI>Penley,</HI> are dependent on it.</P>
<P>IN the church is an alabaster figure of Sir <HI>Francis Kynaston</HI> of <HI>Ottley;</HI> and another of his lady, much mutilated. He died in 1590. The venerable house to which this knight belonged, was one of the most antient freeholds now in the parish; being found to have been the property of e <HI>Kynastons</HI> in 1308, the 2d of <HI>Ed∣ward</HI> II. It has been distinguished by many eminent persons; particularly another Sir <HI>Francis,</HI> esquire of the body to <HI>Charles</HI> I. famous for his Latin translation of the Loves of <HI>Troilus</HI> and Cres∣sida, from the <HI>English</HI> of <HI>Chaucer.</HI></P>
<P>From <HI>Ellesmere</HI> I continued my journey towards <HI>Oswestry.</HI> From an eminence called the <HI>Perthy,</HI> have a most extensive view of the flat part of the county, bounded by the hills of <HI>Den∣bighshire, Montgomeryshire,</HI> and <HI>Shropshire.</HI> Amidst them appear the vast gaps, through which the <HI>Severn</HI> and the <HI>Dee</HI> rush upon the plains out of their mountanous confinement. This tract is intermixed with woods, fertile land, and moors of great extent. After a ride of two or three miles along the flat, reach HALSTON, the seat of the <HI>Myttons,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">HALSTON.</NOTE> my maternal ancestry; a good house, built about the year 1690, with the advantage of wood and

water, managed with excellent taste by my worthy cousin <HI>John Mytton</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR>. The house is situated on an elevated plot of ground, which rises out of an extensive flat, great part of which was subject to frequent floods; an inconvenience which has since been removed by the present owner, at the expence of much trouble and money, in draining considerable tracts of low ground; whereby the neighborhood is rendered more healthy and pleasant. This flat, being well dotted with trees, agree∣ably foreshortens the prospect, till it is bounded by the magni∣ficent scenery of the surrounding hills, which distinctly form, in various shapes, many pleasing points of view. A very extensive wood flanks each side of the house, which is bounded by a fine piece of water, made by extending the banks of the river <HI>Perry,</HI> and by conveying a branch of it through the lower parts of the wood, inclosing several islands, whose shores are shaded by very large full-grown oaks; which all together forms one of the most pleasing artificial pieces of water that is to be met with. The rest of the grounds are watered with the river <HI>Perry;</HI> a stream which used to abound with excellent pike, perch, trout, dace, gudgeons, cray-fish, and eels, till modern luxury gave an additional spur to the dexterity of poachers; a grievance complained of, though encouraged, in this as well as in most rivers in the kingdom. The <HI>Perry</HI> rises in the hills, in the parish of <HI>Syllatyn,</HI> and passes through several moors to the village of <HI>Ryton,</HI> and afterwards falls into the <HI>Severn</HI> a little be∣low <HI>Montford bridge.</HI></P>

<P>IN <HI>Saxon</HI> times,<NOTE PLACE="marg">ANTIENT OWN∣ERS.</NOTE> the lordship of <HI>Halston</HI> belonged to <HI>Edric.</HI> At that time there were on it two <HI>Welshmen</HI> and one <HI>French∣man.</HI> After the Conquest, it became the property of <HI>Guarine,</HI> sheriff of <HI>Shropshire,</HI> ancestor to the <HI>Fitzalans</HI> earls of <HI>Arundel,</HI> by marriage with a <HI>Mellet Peverel,</HI> who received this as part of her fortune.

<P>AT the dissolution, <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. empowered, by his letters patent, <HI>John Sewster</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> to dispose of this manor to <HI>Alan Horde,</HI> who did homage for it; and afterwards exchanged it for other lands, with <HI>Edward Mytton</HI> of <HI>Habberley;</HI> which alienation was confirmed afterwards by queen <HI>Elizabeth.</HI></P>

<P>MR.

AFTER the Conquest, it was held by <HI>Roger</HI> earl of <HI>Shrews∣bury.</HI> It is called in the Doomsday book <HI>Wititone.</HI> It had at that time eight <HI>berewicks</HI> or corn-farms; twelve <HI>bovarii</HI> or ox∣stalls; and a league of wood. The mill yielded five shillings, and the <HI>Welsh</HI> residents there paid twenty shillings.</P>
<P>ON the forfeiture of the cruel <HI>Robert</HI> earl of <HI>Shrewsbury,</HI> it was bestowed on <HI>William,</HI> a sister's son of <HI>Pain Peverel,</HI> lord of <HI>Whittington;</HI> and by the marriage of his second daughter <HI>Mellet,</HI> with <HI>Guarine de Mets,</HI> a noble <HI>Lorrainer,</HI> it became his property, about the year 1083, The deeds of arms, and feats of chivalry, made their progeny the admiration of the times, and the subject of high-flown romance. <HI>Guarine,</HI> then lord of <HI>Ab∣berbury,</HI> and sheriff of the county, hears of the resolution of <HI>Mellet</HI> to marry no one but the knight of most distinguished prowess. The emulous youths were to assemble at <HI>Peverel</HI>'s place, or the castle in the <HI>Peak,</HI> there to approve their worth. Our knight appears among the rest, with his <HI>sylver shelde, and a proude pecok upon his beualme creste;</HI> overthrows his rivals; car∣ries off the fair prize; and receives the lordship of <HI>Whittington</HI> as her dower. His posterity assumed the name of <HI>Fitz-warine;</HI> continued lords of this place for near four hundred years; and every heir, for nine descents, preserved the Christian name of <HI>Fulk.</HI></P>
<P>THIS warlike race, and their warlike neighbors the <HI>Welssh,</HI> had perpetual feuds: their spirits were too congenial to enjoy peace. <HI>Guarine</HI> and the prince of <HI>Wales</HI> instantly attacked each other. The son of <HI>Conan</HI> had the advantage<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Dugdale Baron.</HI> i. 4431.</NOTE>, and carried destruction

through all the borders. <HI>Guarine</HI> died in the reign of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and left behind him a son, the first <HI>Fulk Fitz-warine,</HI> one of the great glories of his race, who shone pre-eminent in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> line.</P>
<P>LOVE was the first inducement, in the days of chivalry, to great actions in youthful breasts. <HI>Fulk</HI> becomes enamour<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> with <HI>Hawise,</HI> the daughter of his guardian <HI>Joos.</HI> At her request he relieves the father from most eminent danger; and recent her hand in reward.</P>
<P>To him was entrusted by <HI>Henry</HI> I. the care of the march<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> about the year 1122; from which he was styled <HI>Fulco <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, or</HI> the <HI>lieutenant.</HI> It was not long before he found employ for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> sword.

In future en∣terprizes he was less fortunate: the <HI>British</HI> prince wrested from him the lordship and castle of <HI>Whittington;</HI> which, by a su∣ceeding treaty with <HI>Henry</HI> II. in the second year of his reign <HI>Owen Gwynedd</HI> thought proper to retain; and <HI>Fulk</HI> was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> pensated by a grant of the honor of <HI>Alston</HI> in <HI>Gwynedd∣shire.</HI> He died in an advanced age, and was buried at <HI>Abberbury.</HI></P>
<P>I MUST not forget, that it is related of this <HI>Fulk,</HI> that being at the play of chess with <HI>John,</HI> second son to <HI>Henry</HI> II. he received from him a blow with the board, which he returned with such violence, as almost to demolish the young prince.</P>
<P><PB N="241" REF="272"/>
THE succeeding <HI>Fulk</HI> did not degenerate from his ancestors. He rendered himself so renowned in the wars abroad, that a <HI>French</HI> romance was composed on the actions of himself and progenitors; and translated into <HI>English,</HI> under the title of the <HI>Gestes of</HI> GUARINE <HI>and his sonnes</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Much of it is preserved in the first volume of <HI>Leland</HI>'s <HI>Collectanea,</HI> p. 230.</NOTE>. It consists, as in the case of most writings of this nature, of a mixture of some truth with much fiction.</P>
<P>To him was restored the castle of <HI>Whittington</HI> and its depen∣dencies, after satisfaction had been made by king <HI>John</HI> to <HI>Wrenoc</HI> and <HI>Wennen,</HI> the sons of <HI>Meyric,</HI> on whom the prince of <HI>Wales</HI> had bestowed it in the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> II. <HI>Wrenoc</HI> received cer∣tain lands in the neighborhood, which he was to hold by the service of being the king's <HI>Latimer,</HI> or interpreter, in these parts, between the <HI>Welsh</HI> and the <HI>English</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Blunt</HI>'s antient tenures, 17.</NOTE>. <HI>Fulk,</HI> notwithstanding this, fell afterwards from his allegiance to <HI>John;</HI> and was excommu∣nicated by name<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>Rymer.</HI></NOTE> for his defection from that monarch: but his sufferings were in the cause of liberty; for he was among the glorious band who obtained from <HI>John</HI> the charter so highly prized by every true <HI>Briton.</HI></P>
<P>IT appears that he did not neglect, in the following reign, to obtain a confirmation of these estates, and to secure them to all posterity. He obtained in 1219 from <HI>Henry</HI> III. a grant of <HI>Whittington</HI> to him and his heirs; for which he gave the king two hundred and sixty-two pounds, and two coursers. He also procured the liberty of a market here on a <HI>Wednesday,</HI> and a</P>
<P><PB N="242" REF="273"/>
fair on St. <HI>Luke</HI>'s day; for which he presented his majesty with a palfrey.<NOTE PLACE="marg">FAIRS.</NOTE> The first is lost. There are still considerable fairs or shews of cattle on the last <HI>Thursdays</HI> in <HI>April, July,</HI> and <HI>September.</HI></P>
<P>FROM another favor bestowed on him by the same monarch, in the year 1220, it appears, that probably the castle of <HI>Whitting∣ton</HI> had been dismantled by the <HI>Welsh;</HI> for <HI>Henry</HI> gives permis∣sion to this <HI>Fulk</HI> to fortify it. The memory of this is still pre∣served in a room in the gateway, by the figure of a knight on horseback coarsely painted on the wall, with the following lines, now almost obliterated, placed beneath:</P>
<Q><L>This was Sir <HI>Foulk Fitz-warren,</HI> late a great and valiant knight,</L>
<L>Who kept the <HI>Britons</HI> still in awe, and oftimes put to flight.</L>
<L>He of this castle owner was, and held it by command</L>
<L>Of <HI>Henry,</HI> late surnamed the third, then king of all this land.</L>
<L>His grandfather, a <HI>Lorrainer,</HI> by fame was much befriended,</L>
<L>Who <HI>Peverley</HI>'s daur took to wife, from this <HI>Foul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> descended.</L>
<L>His antient feats of chivalry in annals are recorded,</L>
<L>Our king of <HI>England</HI> afterwards him baron made, and lorded.</L></Q>
<P>DUGDALE informs us, that this baron was drowned in a river at the battle of <HI>Lewes,</HI> fighting in behalf of the king; but Mr. <HI>Mytton</HI> reasonably supposes, that it must have been his son who appeared in the field that day: for, from the time that this <HI>Fulk</HI> was appointed lieutenant of the marches by <HI>Richard</HI> I. to that of the battle, seventy-five years had elapsed; so it is pro∣bable that he was dead, or at lest unable to act the warrior. His son, therefore, must have been the person who fell in that fatal action; followed by a body of hardy soldiers, raised in
<PB N="243" REF="274"/>
these marches, inured to war by their frequent conflicts with the <HI>Welsh.</HI></P>
<P>IMMEDIATELY on the defeat, the rebel victor, <HI>Montfort</HI> earl of <HI>Leicester,</HI> appointed <HI>Peter de Montfort,</HI> a creature of his own, governor of this castle; and soon after, making use of the cap∣tive monarch's power against himself, obliged him<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rymer, i. 814.</NOTE> to resign to <HI>Llewelyn ap Gryffydd</HI> prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> the hundred of <HI>Ellesmere,</HI> several of the border castles, and among others that of <HI>Whit∣tington</HI> and its appertenances. This writ was dated from <HI>Here∣ford, June</HI> 22d 1265. <HI>Henry</HI> also ceded to him the sovereignty of <HI>Wales,</HI> and homage of all the <HI>Welsh</HI> barons, and the lord of <HI>Whittington.</HI> These grants were afterwards confirmed to him by <HI>Henry,</HI> with the homage of the neighboring counties (which were usually paid to princes ancestors) in consideration of 30,000 marks paid by <HI>Llewelyn.</HI></P>
<P>IN 1281, <HI>Fulk</HI> attended <HI>Edward</HI> I. in his expedition against the <HI>Welsh;</HI> and was rewarded by the grant of free-warren on his lands in this manor.</P>
<P>IN 1300, he had a feud with his potent neighbor <HI>Richard</HI> earl of <HI>Arundel;</HI> but it was prevented by the interference of the king.</P>
<P>HE died in the reign of <HI>Edward</HI> II. His son was at that time in <HI>France,</HI> in his majesty's service; whose lady, <HI>Alionora,</HI> had livery of the manor till her husband could return to do homage.</P>
<P>IN 1329, or the 3d of <HI>Edward</HI> III. the new earl was accused by <HI>Edmund</HI> earl of <HI>Kent,</HI> uncle to the king, of raising seditious
<PB N="244" REF="275"/>
reports, that <HI>Edward</HI> II. was still alive; and endeavouring to excite a rebellion. For this offence his castle of <HI>Whittington</HI> was seized; but, by the intercession of his peers, restored to him the following year.</P>
<P>IN the insurrection of <HI>Owen Glyndwr,</HI> the vassals favored his cause: but their lord obtained a pardon for them from <HI>Henry</HI> IV.</P>
<P>IN 1420, the 8th of <HI>Henry</HI> V. this illustrious race became ex∣tinct in the male line; the last <HI>Fulk</HI> dying in his non-age, leav∣ing <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> his only sister, heiress to his estates. She married <HI>Richard Haukford</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> who dying in 1430, the 9th of <HI>Henry</HI> VI. left an only daughter <HI>Thomasine.</HI> She married Sir <HI>William Bourchier,</HI> created, on that account, lord <HI>Fitz-warine.</HI> A descendant of his, John earl of Bath, exchanged this manor with <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. for other lands. <HI>Edward</HI> VI. granted it to <HI>Henry Grey</HI> duke of <HI>Suffolk:</HI> and <HI>Mary,</HI> on his attainder, bestowed it on <HI>Henry</HI> last earl of <HI>Arundel</HI> of the name of <HI>Fitz-alan.</HI> It was by him mortgaged to one <HI>William Albany,</HI> and other citizens of <HI>London.</HI> The last released their title to <HI>Albany,</HI> who foreclosed the estate. His great grandaughter, and sole heiress, married <HI>Thomas Lloyd</HI> of <HI>Aston,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> in this county.</P>
<P>THE castle stands on a flat: the gateway,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CASTLE.</NOTE> and the ruins of two vast round towers, with cruciform slips by way of windows, still remain; and the bare vestiges of two others may yet be traced. It had been surrounded by a moat, and several vast ditches, which comprehended several other works. The moat was filled by a rivulet that rises near <HI>Pentre Pant,</HI> in the parish of <HI>Sela∣tyn.</HI> On entering this parish, it is lost for near a mile, and emerges in the fields on the back of the castle.</P>
<P><PB N="245" REF="276"/>
IT is probable, that this was a place of defence from the time of its earliest possessors. No place on the borders of unfriendly nations could possibly remain unfortified; but the architect of the castle whose ruins we now contemplate, was certainly the great <HI>Fitz-warine,</HI> granson of Guarine, founder of the family. These were among the greatest of the barons called <HI>Lord marchers of Wales;</HI> of whose origin an ample account will be given in the appendix.</P>
<P>THE steward of the manor holds annually a court-leet and court-baron in a room in the castle;<NOTE PLACE="marg">STEWARD.</NOTE> to which the inhabitants are summoned, and fined one penny each for non-attendance. Chief-rents are payed to the lord; and a heriot of the best beast is clamed at the death of most of the freeholders within the lordship.</P>
<P>THE church,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHURCH.</NOTE> dedicated to St. <HI>John</HI> the <HI>Baptist,</HI> is a rectory, valued in the king's books at 25 <HI>l.</HI> 4 <HI>s.</HI> It is a small building, supposed to have been originally designed as the chapel to the castle, and made out of the refuse materials of that fortress by its founder. According to the tradition of the place, he was buried in the porch, it being an act of devotion, in those days, for all persons, on their entrance into churches or religious houses, to pray for the souls of the founders and benefactors. <HI>Fulk Fitz-warine,</HI> seventh of the name, who had the greatest revenue of any of the family, by will, dated the 15th of <HI>Rich∣ard</HI> II. directed that his body should be buried in the chancel. The largest part of his estates were in other counties; but he gave this place the preference, as the antient seat of the family.</P>
<P><PB N="246" REF="277"/>
IN the year 1630, a commission was issued from the council in the marches of <HI>Wales,</HI> to <HI>John Trevor</HI> and <HI>Richard Lloyd,</HI> gentle∣men, to make a terrier of the glebe-land, and to return an in∣ventory of the furniture belonging to it; among which were found three pair of armour, furnished with two pikes and two head-pieces. These seem to have been designed for the use of the rector, for the defence of the castle, in case of any sudden inroad of the <HI>Welsh.</HI></P>
<P>AFTER leaving the village, in the road towards <HI>Oswestry,</HI> I observed on the right <HI>Tre-newydd,</HI> a seat of <HI>Watkin Williams</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> in right of his mother, heiress of the place. Her gran∣father, <HI>Edward Lloyd</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> who died in 1715, was eminent for his learning, and had prepared materials for the history of this his native country.

The barbarian victor cut the body of the slain prince into pieces, and stuck them on stakes dispersed over the field, as so many trophies; or, according to the antient verses that relate the legend, his head and hands only were thus exposed:</P>

<P><PB N="251" REF="282"/>I MUST add,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CAE-NET.</NOTE> that near the town is a field called <HI>Cae-nes,</HI> or <HI>Heaven-field,</HI> which some have imagined to have been the place of his martyrdom.

<P>THE vassals of the earls of <HI>Arundel</HI> in these parts were of a mixed nature; either descendants of the <HI>Norman</HI> followers of their ancestor <HI>Alan,</HI> or of the native <HI>Welsh,</HI> who were most nu∣merous, and bore an hereditary dislike to their co-tenants of foreign stock. The <HI>welsh</HI> part was called <HI>walcheria,</HI> and lay in the upper part of the manor.</P>
<P>THIS charter of earl <HI>Thomas</HI> was confirmed by his several suc∣cessors, to the time of <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. <HI>Charles</HI> II. granted another;

<P>ABOUT a mile from <HI>Oswestry,</HI> in the parish of <HI>Sellatyn,</HI> lies a fine military post, on an insulated eminence of an oblong form, which has been fortified with much art. The top is an exten∣sive area, containing fifteen acres, three roods, and eight perches, of fertile ground, surrounded with two ramparts and fosses of great heighths and depths. At a distance from these, at the foot of the hill, is another deep foss, which surrounds the whole, and ends (as do the two others) at the two entrances; which are placed diagonally opposite to each other. On the slope of the hill, on both sides of one entrance, are a range of deep oblong trenches, running transversely between the second ditch and another, which seems to be designed for their immedi∣ate protection; for the first extends no farther than these trench∣es; the other, to no great distance beyond them.</P>
<P>THIS place is called <HI>Old Oswerstry,<NOTE PLACE="marg">OLD OSWESTRY.</NOTE> H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n Ddinas,</HI> and antiently <HI>Caer Ogyrfan,</HI> from <HI>Ogyrfan</HI> a hero co-existent with <HI>Arthur.</HI> There is no certainty of the origin of it: some ascribe it to <HI>Oswald</HI> or to <HI>Penda,</HI> and imagine that it was possessed, before the battle of <HI>Maserfeld,</HI> by one of those princes. Others think it to have been the work of the antient <HI>Britons;</HI> to which opinion I in∣cline. The strength, and the labor in forming it, evince that it was not a sudden operation, like that of a camp. Its con∣struction, even to the oblong trenches, is <HI>British;</HI> for example, that of <HI>Bryn y Clawddiau,</HI> on the <HI>Clwydian</HI> hills, which divide <HI>Flintshire</HI> from the vale of <HI>Clwyd,</HI> is a similar work.</P>
<P><PB N="259" REF="290"/>A GREAT dike and foss,<NOTE PLACE="marg">WAT'S DIKE.</NOTE> called <HI>Wat</HI>'s, is continued from each side of this post.

<P>No reason appears why its course was not continued from sea to sea. It seems probable that <HI>Offa</HI> imagined that the <HI>Clwydian</HI> hills, and the deep valley that lies on this side at their base,
<PB N="261" REF="292"/>
would serve as a continuance of his prohibitory line: he had carried his arms over most part of <HI>Flintshire,</HI> and vainly ima∣gined, that his labors would restrain the <HI>Cambrian</HI> inroads in one part, and his orders prevent any incursions beyond these na∣tural limits, which he had decreed should be the boundaries of his new conquests. The weakness of this great work appeared on the death of <HI>Offa:</HI> the <HI>Welsh,</HI> with irresistible fury, despised his toils, and carried their ravages far and wide on the <HI>English</HI> marches. Superior force often repelled our countrymen. San∣guinary laws were made by the victorious <HI>Harold</HI> against any that should transgress the limits prescribed by <HI>Offa.</HI> The <HI>Welsh∣man</HI> that was found in arms on the <HI>Saxon</HI> side of the ditch, was to lose his right-hand<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Leland Collect.</HI> iii. 230. <HI>Joannes Sarishuriensis,</HI> as quoted by <HI>Camden,</HI> 698.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IT is observable, that in all parts the ditch is on the <HI>Welsh</HI> side; and that there are numbers of small artificial mounts, the sites of small forts, in many places along its course. These were garrisoned, and seem intended for the same purposes as the towers in the famous <HI>Chinese</HI> wall, to watch the motions of their neighbors, and to repel the hostile incursions.</P>
<P>IT is remarkable, that <HI>Wat</HI>'s dike should have been overlooked or confounded with that of <HI>Offa,</HI> by all writers, except by <HI>Tho∣mas Churchyard</HI> the poet<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Vide <HI>Churchyard</HI>'s Worthines of <HI>Wales,</HI> originally printed in 1587; re∣printed by <HI>Thomas Evans</HI> 1776.</NOTE>, who assigns the object of the work: that the space intervening between the two was free ground, where the <HI>Britons</HI> and <HI>Saxons</HI> might meet with safety for all com∣mercial purposes.</P>

<P>THIS happy disproportion of encrease between births and bu∣rials, seems to arise from the hilly situation of the parish; which slopes down to the moory flats of those of <HI>Oswestry</HI> and <HI>Whit∣tington,</HI> without partaking the lest of their nature. The improve∣ments in agriculture contribute much to retain numbers of the inhabitants, by finding them a wholesome and innocent em∣ploy: the want of which exiles multitudes, in many places, to the vice and disease of great cities.</P>
<P>THE first house I visited is <HI>Porkington,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">PORKINGTON.</NOTE> the seat of <HI>Robert Go∣dolphin Owen</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR>.

These are now destroyed. The whole parish consists of a single township, which also bears the same title with the mansion.</P>
<P>THE name of the house was soon altered to one very nearly resembling the present.

<P>I MUST now make a very long transition from this period to that which produced another distinguished personage of this family.<NOTE PLACE="marg">SIR JOHN OWEN.</NOTE> Here is preserved the portrait of Sir <HI>John Owen</HI> knight, of <HI>Clenneney</HI> in <HI>Caernarvonshire;</HI> a gallant officer, and strenuous supporter of the cause of <HI>Charles</HI> I.

Congenial qualities recommended him to his highness; who, superseding the appoint∣ment of archbishop <HI>Williams</HI> to the government of <HI>Conway</HI> castle, in 1645, constituted Sir <HI>John</HI> commander in his place. This fortress was soon given up to general <HI>Mytton,</HI> by the con∣trivance of the prelate, and the power of his friends: and the knight retired to his seat in the distant parts of the county.

He then laid siege to <HI>Caernarvon;</HI> but hearing that certain of the parlement forces, under the colonels <HI>Carter</HI> and <HI>Twisleton,</HI> were on their march to attack him, he hastened to meet them, and took the sheriff with him on a litter. He met with his enemies near <HI>Llandegai:</HI> a furious recontre ensued, in which Sir <HI>John</HI> had at first the advantage; but falling in with their reserve, fortune de∣clared against him: in a personal contest with a captain <HI>Taylor,</HI> he was pulled off his horse, and made prisoner; and his troops, disheartened by the loss of their commander, took to flight. The sheriff died the same day. The victory was esteemed of that consequence, that captain <HI>Taylor,</HI> who was the messenger of the news to the parlement, received a reward of two hundred pounds out of Sir <HI>John</HI>'s estate<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Rushworth,</HI> ii. part iv. 1146.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>SIR JOHN was conveyed to <HI>Windsor</HI> castle, where he found four noblemen under confinement for the same cause.

The duke of <HI>Hamilton,</HI> the earl of <HI>Holland,</HI> and the lords <HI>Goring</HI> and <HI>Capel,</HI> were put upon their trials. Sir <HI>John</HI> shewed a spirit worthy of his country. He told his judges, that <Q>he was a plain gentleman of <HI>Wales,</HI> who had been always taught to obey the king; that he had served him honestly during the war; and, finding many honest
<PB N="265" REF="299"/>
men endeavored to raise forces, whereby he might get him out of prison, he did the like;</Q> and concluded like a man who did not much care what they resolved concerning him. In the end he was condemned to lose his head; for which, with a hu∣morous intrepidity, he made the court a low reverence, and gave his humble thanks. A by-stander asked what he meant: he replied aloud, <Q>It was a great honour to a poor gentleman of <HI>Wales</HI> to lose his head with such noble lords; for by G—, he was afraid they would have hanged him.</Q></P>
<P>SIR JOHN, by mere good-fortune, was disappointed of the honor he was flattered with; being, as his epitaph says, <HI>Famae plus quam vitae sollicito.</HI> He neither solicited for a pardon, nor was any petition offered to parlement in his favor; which was strongly importuned in behalf of his fellow-prisoners. <HI>Ireton</HI> proved his advocate, and told the house, <Q>That there was one person for whom no one spoke a word; and therefore requested, that he might be saved by the sole motive and goodness of the house.</Q> In consequence, mercy was extended to him; and, af∣ter a few months imprisonment, he was, on his petition, set at liberty. He retired again into his country, where he died in 1666; and was interred in the church of <HI>Penmorva</HI> in <HI>Caer∣narvonshire,</HI> where a small monument preserves the following epitaph.</P>

<P>FROM hence I hastened towards <HI>Chirk</HI> castle, keeping a lower road between the two dikes. On approaching the village of <HI>Chirk,</HI> is a very deep valley, consisting of fertile meadows, wa∣tered by the brook <HI>Ceiriog,</HI> and finely bounded by lofty wooded banks. On the very verge of that next to <HI>Chirk,</HI> stands an ar∣tificial mount; and, I think, the vestige of another, on the other side of the road which goes between them. These were explo∣ratory, and probably designed also for defence; and might have had on them a small fort for the protection of the pass. I imagine these mounts to have been <HI>Saxon,</HI> and coeval with the great labor of <HI>Offa,</HI> which runs at a small distance from them.</P>
<P>IN this deep valley,<NOTE PLACE="marg">BATTLE OF CRO∣GEN.</NOTE> which winds along the foot of the vast <HI>Berwyn</HI> mountains, was a bloody conflict between part of the forces of <HI>Henry</HI> II. and the <HI>Welsh,</HI> in 1165. <HI>Henry</HI> had determined once more to attempt the subjection of <HI>Wales,</HI> and to revenge the ravages carried through the borders by its gallant prince
<PB N="268" REF="302"/>
<HI>Owen Gwynedd;</HI> for that end, he assembled a vast army at <HI>Os∣westry.

He marched towards him; and in this valley, finding himself intangled in impenetrable woods, and recollecting his ill∣fortune among the forests of <HI>Eulo,</HI> directed his vanguard to make the passage clear, by cutting down the trees, in order to secure himself from ambuscade. The pikemen, and flower of his army, were posted to cover the workmen. The spirit of the common soldiers of the <HI>Welsh</HI> army grew indignant at this attempt; and, without the knowlege of their officers, fell with unspeakable fury on these troops. The contest was violent; numbers of brave men perished; in the end, the <HI>Welsh</HI> retired to <HI>Corwen. Henry</HI> gained the summit of the <HI>Berwyn;</HI> but was so distressed by dreadful rains, and by the activity and prudence of <HI>Owen,</HI> who cut him off from all supplies, that he was ob∣liged to return ingloriously, with great loss of men and equipage<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Powel,</HI> 221.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>THE next possessor which occurs to me, is the unfortunate Sir <HI>William Stanley,</HI> who, as <HI>Leland</HI> says, 'repayred it welle.' After his ungrateful execution, it became forfeited to his rapacious master; and, as I conjecture, was bestowed, in 1534, along with <HI>Holt Castle</HI> (another of Sir <HI>William</HI>'s castles) by <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. on his natural son <HI>Henry Fitz-roy</HI> duke of <HI>Richmond</HI> and Somerset <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>King</HI>'s Vale-royal, 195.</NOTE>.

<P>IN the following reign, I imagine it to have been granted to <HI>Thomas</HI> lord <HI>Seymour,</HI> brother to the protector <HI>Somerset;</HI> for I find him in possession of <HI>Holt</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>Dugdale Baron.</HI> ii. 368.</NOTE>, to which it was an ap∣pendage.</P>
<P>ELIZABETH granted it, with the same lordships, to her worth∣less favorite <HI>Dudley</HI> earl of <HI>Leicester.</HI> On his death, <HI>Chirk Castle</HI> became the property of lord St. <HI>John</HI> of <HI>Bletso;</HI> whose son, in 1595, sold it to Sir <HI>Thomas Middleton</HI> knight, mayor of <HI>London</HI> in 1614.</P>
<P>THIS exalted pile has much to boast of in its vast view into seventeen counties; a most elegant and varied extent! The castle is square, and has five rounders uncommonly clumsy and

<P>THE chief apartments are a saloon, fifty-six feet by twenty-seven; and a drawing-room within: a gallery, a hundred feet by twenty-two, filled with portraits.

<P><PB N="273" REF="308"/>THE usual appertenance to antient castles, the dungeon, must not be forgotten.

<P>RE-PASSING through the castle-gate,<NOTE PLACE="marg">BARBAROUS CUSTOM.</NOTE> I recollect a barbarous privelege, retained longer in this country than in any other part of <HI>Britain,</HI> that of exempting from capital punishment even the most atrocious assassin, by payment of a certain fine. This was practised by the lord marchers of these parts in the fifteenth century; and continued in <HI>Mowddwy</HI> in <HI>Merionethshire</HI> till it was abolished in the 27th of <HI>Henry</HI> VIII <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Gwydir</HI> family, 107.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THIS custom was derived from the antient <HI>Germans,</HI> who accept∣ed a fine of cattle as a compensation for murder; which satisfied the relations, and was not detrimental to the public, which could not fail being injured by the extension of private re∣venge <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Tacitus</HI> de mor. Germ. c. z.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Saxons</HI> continued this custom under the name of <HI>Were-geld;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">WERE-GELD.</NOTE> and accordingly set a price on every rank, from the king to the peasant <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Wilkin's Leges Sax. 71.</NOTE>. The head of the king was valued at thirty thousand <HI>thrymses,</HI> or 4,500 <HI>l.</HI>; half to be paid to his relations, and half to the kingdom for the loss it had sustained: that of a countryman was esteemed at two hundred and sixty-six, or 39 <HI>l.</HI> 18 <HI>s.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="274" REF="309"/>THE <HI>Were-geld</HI> of a <HI>Welshman</HI> was very low; for, unless he had property enough to be taxed for the king's use, his life was not reckoned of higher price than seventy <HI>thrymses,</HI> or ten guineas. The money or fine was distributed, as in the time of the antient <HI>Germans,</HI> among the relations of the deceased; and oftentimes part went to the lord of the soil, as compensation for his loss.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Welsh</HI> had in like manner their <HI>Galanas</HI> and <HI>Gwerth,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">GWERTH.</NOTE> of the same nature with the former; but our fine was usually paid in cattle, the wealth of the country.</P>
<P>BUT the <HI>Gwerth</HI> was not only a compensation for murder or homicide; but for all species of injuries. To cuckold the prince was expiated at a very high rate <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Leges Wallica,</HI> 199.</NOTE>; the offender was fined in a gold cup and cover, as broad as his majesty's face, and as thick as a ploughman's nail who had ploughed nine years; and a rod of gold as tall as the king, and as thick as his little finger; a hundred cows for every <HI>cantref</HI> he ruled over, with a white bull with different colored ears to every hundred cows.</P>
<P>THE recompence to a virgin who had been seduced is very sin∣gular: on complaint made that she was deserted by her lover, it was ordered by the court, that she was to lay hold of the tail of a bull three years old, introduced through a wicker-door, and shaven, and well-greased. Two men were to goad the beast: if she could by dint of strength retain the bull, she was to have it by way of satisfaction; if not, she got nothing but the grease that remain∣ed in her hands <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The same, 82.</NOTE>. I fear by this, and other penalties for the
<PB N="275" REF="310"/>
same offence, that the crime was not held by my countrymen to be of a very deep dye.</P>
<P>WELSH, SAXONS, and NORMANS, had each their pecuniary atonements for lesser injuries. A <HI>Welshman,</HI> for the loss of his finger, received one cow and twenty pence; of his nose, six oxen and a hundred and twenty pence; and for being pulled by the hair, a penny for every finger, and two-pence for the thumb, the instruments of the insult <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Leges Wallicae,</HI> 278.</NOTE>. The <HI>Saxons</HI> had similar fines <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Wilkin's Leges Saxon.</HI> 44.</NOTE> and the <HI>Normans,</HI> like persons of nice honor, provided a penalty of five <HI>sous</HI> for a lug by the nose, and ten <HI>pour un coup au derriere</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">MS. notes to my copy of <HI>Les Coustumes de Normandie.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Scotch</HI> had also similar compensations for homicides and injuries; which, in their old laws, passed under the name of <HI>Cro, Galnes,</HI> and <HI>Kelchyn</HI> <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot"><HI>Regiam majestatem,</HI> 74.</NOTE>: and lastly, the <HI>Irish</HI> had their <HI>Eric,</HI> or satisfaction for blood <NOTE N="|" PLACE="foot"><HI>Davies,</HI> Hist. <HI>Ireland,</HI> 109.</NOTE>. In fact, it prevaled over all parts of <HI>Europe,</HI> with variations conformable to the several complections of the country.</P>
<P>I CANNOT but relate the occasion of this digression. Two villains, who had committed a most horrid murder <NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">They had killed a poor parson, at the instigation of their chieftain, because his wife had preferred the nursing another great man's child to his.</NOTE> in the re∣mote of parts <HI>Wales,</HI> had fled into this neighborhood for pro∣tection, about the latter end of the fifteenth century. Two fa∣milies at that time divided the country with their feuds; the <HI>Kyffins</HI> and the <HI>Trevors:</HI> who were ready at any time to receive
<PB N="276" REF="311"/>
under their protection, any banditti that were recommended to them by their remote friends, when their villanies rendered it unsafe for them to remain at home. The <HI>Trevors</HI> at this time gave <HI>asylum</HI> to these murderers. The friends of the person they had slain wished for revenge: being at that time in league with the <HI>Kyffins,</HI> a plot was laid to surprize the assassins. <HI>Jevan ap Meredeth,</HI> a gentleman of <HI>Caernarvonshire,</HI> who was most anxious to obtain redress for the injury, came over with six men, and was directed to keep himself concealed, least the <HI>Trevors</HI> should be alarmed, and frustrate his design. He accordingly kept within all day, and watched all night: at length the villains fell in∣to his hands. The <HI>Trevors</HI> instantly pursued him; when he was told by the <HI>Kyffins,</HI> that if he was overtaken, and the offenders rescued, he would lose his revenge; for, according to the cus∣tom of the country, they would be carried before the gate of <HI>Chirk-castle,</HI> and be instantly cleared, on the payment of five pounds. This determined <HI>Jevan</HI> to order his followers to strike off their heads on the spot. One of them executed his order but faintly; when the criminal told him, that if he had his neck under his sword, he would <HI>make it take a better edge</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Gwydir</HI> family, 107.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>I WISH the cause had been better, that applause might have been given to this contempt of death; but such assassins as these could scarcely be animated with the prospect of immortality; which made their remote ancestors, inspired by the <HI>Druid</HI> songs, think it disgraceful to preserve a life that was so soon to return.</P>
<P><PB N="277" REF="312"/>THE same consideration influenced the antient <HI>Danes;</HI> a warrior <HI>fell</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Bartholinus</HI> de Contempt. mortis. p. 5.</NOTE>, <HI>laughed, and died.</HI> Thus was the end of the <HI>Scandinavian</HI> hero, <HI>Agnerus.</HI></P>

<P><PB N="278" REF="313"/>DESCEND towards <HI>Llangollen,</HI> seated on the river, environed by lofty mountains.

<P>LITTLE remains of the old house, excepting a narrow, vaulted room, whose roof is formed or nine strong ribs of stone, covered with narrow flags layed over them like planks.

<P>LLANGOLLEN is a small and poor town,<NOTE PLACE="marg">LLANGOLLEN.</NOTE> seated in a most romantic spot, near a pretty common watered by the <HI>Dee,</HI> which, emblematic of its country, runs with great passion through the valley.

<P>THE bridge,<NOTE PLACE="marg">BRIDGE.</NOTE> which was founded by the first <HI>John Trevor</HI> bishop of St. <HI>Asaph</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Willis</HI>'s St. <HI>Asaph,</HI> 52. 285.</NOTE>, who died in 1357, is one of the <HI>Tri Thlws Cymru,</HI> or three beauties of <HI>Wales:</HI> but more remarkable for its situa∣tion than structure. It consists of five arches; whose widest does not exceed twenty-eight feet in diameter. The river usually runs under only one; where it has formed a black chasm of vast depth, into which the water pours with great fury, from a high broken ledge, formed in the smooth and solid rock, which composes the whole bed of the river. The view through the arches, either upwards or downwards, is extremely pictu∣resque.</P>
<P>NEAR the foot of the bridge, opposite to the town,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CASTELL DINAS BRAN.</NOTE> begins the ascent to <HI>Castell Dinas Brân,</HI> whose remains nearly cover the summit of a vast conoid hill, steeply sloped on every side. The form is oblong: the materials the coarse stone of the country, with here and there a few free-stone moldings. The side, which
<PB N="280" REF="317"/>
is less steep, defended by deep trenches, cut through the solid rock. This was one of our primitive <HI>Welsh</HI> castles. The foun∣der is unknown. I dare not attribute its origin and name to <HI>Brennus</HI> king of the <HI>Gauls,</HI> who besieged the capitol; and is fabled to have come into these parts to fight with his brother <HI>Belinus:</HI> nor yet do I derive it from <HI>Bryn,</HI> a hill, nor <HI>Bran,</HI> a crow; but from the mountain river <HI>Brân,</HI> that runs down its side.</P>
<P>IT had been the chief seat of the lords of <HI>Jâl</HI> or <HI>Yale;</HI> and probably was founded by one of them. In the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> III. it was the retreat of <HI>Gryffydd ap Madog,</HI> who traiterously siding with the <HI>English</HI> against his countrymen, was obliged to secure himself in this aërial fastness.</P>
<P>ON the death of <HI>Gryffydd, Edward</HI> I. ungratefully bestowed on <HI>John</HI> earl <HI>Warren,</HI> the wardship of the eldest son of his old partizan; as he did that of the second on <HI>Roger Mortimer.</HI> Both the guardians understood the meaning of the favor; and accor∣dingly made away with the poor children, and received full possession of their estates <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rotuli Walliae, 81.</NOTE>, as before related. From the <HI>Warrens</HI> it passed by marriage to the <HI>Fitzalans,</HI> and followed the succession of the lords of <HI>Bromfield.</HI></P>
<P>THE time of its ruin is unknown. <HI>Leland</HI> speaks of it as a demolished place; and adds, that an eagle built annually in the neighboring rocks; that a person was wont to be lowered down in a basket to take the young; and was obliged to have another basket over his head, to save him from the fury of the old birds.</P>

<P>AFTER a short repose,<NOTE PLACE="marg">RHIWABON.</NOTE> on my descent from the castle, I made an excursion to <HI>Rhiwabon,</HI> a few miles from <HI>Llangollen.</HI> For some time the ride was along the sides of the <HI>Dee,</HI> which wa∣tered a beautiful narrow vale. The hills at length approximate so nearly, as only to leave room for a most picturesque passage, shaded with trees. Cross a bridge called the <HI>New bridge,</HI> and ascend for some space, leaving on the left considerable pits both of coal and canal: reach the village of <HI>Rhiwabon,</HI> which takes its name from the <HI>Avon,</HI> or little river on which it lies.</P>
<P><PB N="285" REF="322"/>THE church is dedicated to St. <HI>Mary.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">CHURCH.</NOTE> It has been lately fit∣ted up in a very neat manner by Sir <HI>Watkin Williams Wynn,</HI> who bestowed on it an organ, and a small font; the last, on occasion of the christening of his eldest son in 1772: is of white marble, supported by a tripod of distinguished elegance.</P>
<P>THE monument to his first wife,<NOTE PLACE="marg">MONUMENTS.</NOTE> lady <HI>Harriet Somerset,</HI> is in fine taste. The figure of Hope reclines on an urn, and is at∣tended with her usual emblem of an anchor. A serpent with its tail in its mouth, expressive of eternity, includes the inscription on one side of the pedestal.</P>
<P>As a contrast to this excellent performance of Mr. <HI>Nollikin,</HI> is placed against the wall a great monument of <HI>Henry Wynn</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> tenth son of Sir <HI>John Wynn</HI> of <HI>Gwydir,</HI> who died in 1671. His attitude is that of a fanatical preacher; and his dress a full-buttoned coat, short skirts, and square shoes; a most un∣happy subject for the sculptor. On one side kneels Sir <HI>John Wynn</HI> of <HI>Wynn-stay,</HI> baronet; and on the other, <HI>Jane</HI> his wife, daughter to <HI>Eyton Evans,</HI> by whom he acquired the estate. He died at the age of ninety-one, in 1718; and left his fortune to the late Sir <HI>W. W. Wynn.</HI> He is represented blind: this accident (in his extreme age) is mentioned in his epitaph as a benefit, since his inward perceptions were improved by this bodily defect. It reminds me of two lines of <HI>Waller,</HI> in which the same idea is much better expressed:</P>
<Q><L>The soul's dark cottage batter'd and decay'd</L>
<L>Lets in new light, thro' chinks which time hath made.</L></Q>
<P><PB N="286" REF="323"/>IN the same chapel is an antient tomb, of the altar fashion, with monkish <HI>pleureurs</HI> on the sides, and angels holding shields of now defaced arms. On the top are recumbent two figures; an armed man with a collar of SS. and a lady lying on a cloak: at their feet a lion with a monk sitting on it, with his head reclined on one hand.</P>
<P>AROUND the edges of the tomb is this inscription:</P>
<P>Orate pro anima <HI>Johannis ap Elis Eyton,</HI> armigeri qui obiit vicessimo octavo die menfis <HI>Septembris</HI> anno Domini 1526; et pro anima <HI>Elizabeth. Calfley</HI> uxoris ejus, quae obiit xi. die menfis <HI>Junii</HI> anno Domini 1524; quorum animabus pro∣picietur Deus. <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
<P>THIS gentleman joined <HI>Henry</HI> VII. before the battle of <HI>Bos∣worth;</HI> and for his good services had considerable grants of land in these parts. He was of the house of <HI>Eyton</HI> before-men∣tioned. His grandfather was twice married to the same lady; who, on some pretence of consanguinity, had been divorced from him after bearing him a son of the name of <HI>Ellis:</HI> but, obtaining a dispensation, they were re-united in form. After the second marriage, were born other children. A division of the estates was then made: <HI>Rhiwabon</HI> and <HI>Watstay</HI> fell to the share of <HI>Ellis;</HI> and <HI>Eyton</HI> to <HI>John,</HI> the first of the second brood <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Eyten</HI> Pedigree.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>ON the other side of the altar is a noble monument to the late Sir <HI>Watkin Williams Wynn,</HI> whose virtues are still fresh in the minds of his countrymen. A fall from his horse, on <HI>Sep∣tember</HI> 26th 1749, deprived the world of a useful citizen. <HI>Rys∣brack</HI>

the <HI>Berwyn</HI> mountains, and the august breach made into them beyond <HI>Llangollen</HI> by the rapid <HI>Dee,</HI> through the country of the <HI>irregular and wild</HI> GLYNDWR.</P>
<P>NANTY BELE,<NOTE PLACE="marg">NANTY BELE.</NOTE> or the <HI>Dingle of the Martin,</HI> lies about a mile from hence, and merits a visit from every traveller. From a rock at its extremity, is a magnificent view of the <HI>Dee,</HI> rolling awefully in a deep chasm fringed with woods; at last terminat∣ing sullenly in a black and still pool. Towards the north is a great view of the conic mountain, and the rude fortress of <HI>Dinas Brân,</HI> rising amidst a fertile vale, and bounded by the barren <HI>Alps.</HI></P>
<P>THE house has been built at various times. The most antient is a gateway of wood and plaister, dated 1616. On a wall within the court, is this excellent distich, allusive to the name of the house;—<HI>Wynn stay,</HI> or rest satisfied with the good things Providence has so liberally showered on you.</P>

<P>The former name of the place was <HI>Wat-stay,</HI> from its situation on the famous dike; but was changed to the present by Sir <HI>John Wynn,</HI> out of respect to his own name. It was originally called simply <HI>Rhiwabon,</HI> and had been the residence of <HI>Madeg ap Gryffydd Maelor,</HI> founder of <HI>Vale Crucis</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Eyton</HI> Pedigroe.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE new part was built by the late Sir <HI>Watkin;</HI> is of itself a good house; yet was only part of a more extensive design. It is
<PB N="289" REF="326"/>
finished in that substantial yet neat manner becoming the seat of an honest <HI>English</HI> country gentleman; adapted to the recep∣tion of his worthy neighbors, who may experience his hospitality without dread of spoiling the frippery ornaments, becoming only the assembly-rooms of a town-house, or the <HI>villa</HI> of a great city. The present owner meditates the re-building of the old part; and, as he has already shewn such good judgment in a noble room, in which simplicity is joined with grandeur, there is little doubt but he will preserve a style of local propriety throughout the whole.</P>
<P>THE present set of pictures belonging to the house are por∣traits of the families of <HI>Wynn</HI> and <HI>Williams.</HI> Here is a very fine three-quarters of the old Sir <HI>John Wynn</HI> of <HI>Gwedir,</HI> in a high hat, and with a vast white beard, and in the dress of the times of <HI>James</HI> I. I reserve further mention of him till I arrive at his antient seat.</P>
<P>HIS son, Sir <HI>John Wynn</HI> knight, is drawn half-length; a young man, with whiskers and a peaked beard; dark hair; great flat ruff; black vest; white girdle, stuck with points; a white flowered baldric. Sir <HI>John</HI> died on his travels, at <HI>Lucca,</HI> and was succeeded by his brother <HI>Richard.</HI> A most exquisite head of Sir <HI>Richard,</HI> by <HI>Vandyck,</HI> is preserved here. He was gentleman of the privy-chamber to <HI>Charles</HI> I. when prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> and attended him in the romantic journey he took into <HI>Spain,</HI> in 1623, to visit his designed bride. Sir <HI>Richard</HI> drew up an admirable account of his travels, which is printed among other scarce tracts, by Mr. <HI>Thomas Hearn.</HI> On the accession of <HI>Charles</HI> to the throne, he was appointed treasurer to the queen;
<PB N="290" REF="327"/>
and, dying without issue, was succeeded by his brother <HI>Owen.</HI></P>
<P>A HALF-LENGTH of <HI>Henry Wynn</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> another son of the old Sir <HI>John,</HI> and representative of the county of <HI>Merioneth,</HI> in the last parlement of <HI>James</HI> I. He is painted in black hair, a great <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>-over, and a letter in his hand. Here is also a portrait of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> brother, a captain of a man of war, in the same dress: Both of them good performances.</P>
<P>HERE are, besides, several more modern portraits; such as of the two late dukes of <HI>Beaufort</HI> in their robes. A composition, with <HI>Charles</HI> duke of <HI>Beaufort</HI> leaning on the late Sir <HI>Watkin</HI>'s shoulder, looking at the horse legacy. This figure of Sir <HI>Wat∣kin</HI> is the strongest resemblance of him of any.</P>
<P>TWO portraits of the late owner of this place, and his first lady, by <HI>Dahl.</HI> His full wig and dress gives a very disadvan∣tageous idea of him. The fashion is equally the misfortune of the artist and his employer.</P>
<P>A THREE-quarters length of Sir <HI>John Wynn</HI> baronet, with a full wig and cravat. The same whose monument we have be∣fore mentioned.</P>
<P>TWO very fine full-lengths of <HI>Charles</HI> II. and his queen, close this short list.</P>
<P>ON my return to <HI>Rhiwabon,</HI> I passed through the turnpike to∣wards <HI>Wrexham.</HI> On the road I digressed a little to the left, to visit a great <HI>Caer</HI> in this parish, called the <HI>Garthen,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">GARTHEN.</NOTE> i. e. <HI>Caer-ddm,</HI> seated on the summit of a hill commanding a most extensive view a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>urd, of the fine and fertile country of <HI>Maelor Gymraeg,</HI> or <HI>Bromfield;</HI> and part of <HI>Maelor Saesneg,</HI> or <HI>English Maelor,</HI>
<PB N="291" REF="328"/>
mostly flat and wooded. This <HI>Caer</HI> contains about four acres of ground, protected in some parts by one, in others with two very strong dikes and deep ditches. The inner dike is made of loose stones, with a wall of vast thickness on the top. Within the area are many vestiges of buildings, the habitations of the old possessors. It lies between the <HI>Offa</HI>'s and the <HI>Wat</HI>'s dike. Part of the turnpike-road is formed for a considerable way along the top of the first, which shews its prodigious thick∣ness.</P>
<P>I PURSUED the tract of <HI>Wat's dike</HI> to <HI>Erddig,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">ERDDIG.</NOTE> the elegant seat of <HI>Philip Yorke</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> a place where nature has been lavish of beauties, and improved by the excellent taste of the worthy owner. Two little vales bound his lands, watered by a pretty stream, and bordered with hanging woods. Along one side of the bank runs the dike; and at the end, between the two vales, impending over them, are small but strong entrenchments. One surrounds a work of a pentagon form; beyond which, at the very verge, is a mount that seems to have been a <HI>dernier resort</HI> to the garrison, in case they had been beaten out of the former. These compose what is called the <HI>Roman fort;</HI> but there are neither coins or any thing else to confirm the conjecture of its having been one. A fragment of wall cemented with mortar is all that remains of this castelet.</P>
<P>WREXHAM lies at a small distance from this place.<NOTE PLACE="marg">WREXHAM.</NOTE> This town is the largest in <HI>North Wales,</HI> and the parish the most populous. It appears by the antient name to have been of <HI>Saxon</HI> origin; being called <HI>Wrightesham.</HI> I can trace it no farther back than the time of the last earl <HI>Warren,</HI> who had a grant of
<PB N="292" REF="329"/>
it <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Dugdale Baren.</HI> i. 82.</NOTE> <HI>Leland</HI> speaks of it as a place where there were some merchants and good buckler-makers <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Itin.</HI> v. 34.</NOTE>. The parish is at this time noted for a manufactory of instruments of war; but altered for those of offence, instead of defence. Near the place is a great foun∣dery for cannon, under the direction of Mr. <HI>Wilkinson,</HI> who supplies many parts of <HI>Europe</HI> with this <HI>ratio ultima regum;</HI> and in the late war between <HI>Russians</HI> and <HI>Turks,</HI> furnished both parties with this species of logic.</P>
<P>THE church of <HI>Wrexham</HI> is the glory,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHURCH.</NOTE> not only of the place, but of <HI>North Wales;</HI> being a magnificent pile, erected in the time of <HI>Henry</HI> VII. The date on the steeple is 1506. The inside of the church is very spacious; and consists of a nave, two ailes, and a chancel. Above the pillars is abundance of grotesque carv∣ing, in ridicule of the regular clergy, and the female religious, abbesses and nuns; and over the arches of the nave, are many of the arms of the old <HI>British</HI> and <HI>Saxon</HI> princes.<NOTE PLACE="marg">TOMBS.</NOTE> The tombs are numerous. The most antient is of a knight all armed: at his feet is a dog, and beyond that a dragon, whose tail ter∣minates in a serpent's head. On his shield is a lion rampant. Around is an inscription; but all I could make out was <HI>Hic jacet * * * * * * * * * * ap Howel</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">The letters are REH. (or R) EVEHIRE.</NOTE>. This had been dug up, and is now reared against the steeple.</P>
<P>THAT of <HI>Hugh Bellot</HI> vicar of <HI>Gresford,</HI> and afterwards bishop of <HI>Bangor</HI> and of <HI>Chester,</HI> is the next. He lies in his robes re∣cumbent, near the altar. It was his request to be interred in the parish where he died. His death happened at <HI>Berse,</HI> near this
<PB N="293" REF="330"/>
town, in 1596. His funeral was celebrated at <HI>Chester,</HI> and his body deposited here.</P>
<P>ALMOST opposite to the prelate is a magnificent monument, in memory of Mrs. <HI>Mary Middleton,</HI> daughter of Sir <HI>Richard Middleton</HI> of <HI>Chirk castle</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">She died <HI>April</HI> 8th 1747, aged 59.</NOTE>. She is represented rising out of her tomb in all the fulness of youth and beauty. She died a very withered old woman; but I like the thought of the sculptor, allusive to the sublime passage in the burial-service: <HI>The irum∣pet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.</HI> Above is a shattered pyramid, and, what might have been well excused, the gross representation of the angelic beings founding the awakening call.</P>
<P>IN a corner of one aile is a small but elegant monument of the Reverend Mr. <HI>Thomas Middleton,</HI> and his wife <HI>Arabella Hacker,</HI> by <HI>Roubiliac.</HI> Their faces are in profile on a medallion, with a curtain lightly hanging on one side.</P>
<P>AMONG the epitaphs are some to every taste. That to a wor∣thy usher, my earliest instructor, in the school of this town, merits preservation.</P>

<P>ON the outside of the church is great variety of ludicrous and gross sculpture.<NOTE PLACE="marg">STEEPLE.</NOTE> The steeple is a fine tower, richly ornamented on three sides with rows of saints placed in rich gothic niches. Among them is St. <HI>Giles,</HI> the patron saint of the church, with the hind which miraculously nourished him in the desert. At each corner is a light turret with a winding stair-case, twenty-four feet high: the whole height of the steeple is a hundred and thirty-five feet.</P>
<P>Two casualties are recorded to have befallen this building. The steeple was blown down on St. <HI>Catherine</HI>'s day, 1331; and the church was burnt about the year 1457. In order to rebuild it, an indulgence of forty days, for five years, was granted to every contributor to so pious a work.</P>
<P>THE church is a vicarage, formerly an impropriation, belong∣ing to the abbey of <HI>Valle Crucis;</HI> but on a dispute between <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>n</HI> the second, bishop of St. <HI>Asaph,</HI> was restored to the see <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the account of <HI>Valle Crucis,</HI> in the further progress of this work.</NOTE>.

<P><PB N="296" REF="333"/>THE free-school is endowed with ten pounds a year, paid by the mayor of <HI>Chester,</HI> being the bequest of <HI>Valentine Broughton,</HI> alderman of that city, for the instruction of twelve boys.</P>

This place was formerly the property of the <HI>Jefferies,</HI> a race that, after running uncontaminated from an antient stock, had the dis∣grace of producing in the last century <HI>George Jefferies,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">CHANCELLOR JEFFERIES.</NOTE> chancellor of <HI>England;</HI> a man of first-rate abilities in his profession, but of a heart subservient to the worst of actions.

<PB N="297" REF="334"/>
<HI>Charles</HI> II. sat to this great painter; who survived to draw <HI>George</HI> I. and to receive from him the dignity of baronet. <HI>Jef∣feries</HI> was sixth son of <HI>John Jefferies,</HI> and <HI>Margaret</HI> daughter to Sir <HI>Thomas Ireland</HI> of <HI>Beausey,</HI> near <HI>Warrington.</HI> Here is pre∣served a good portrait of the old gentleman, in black, sitting: it was drawn in the 82d year of his age, in 1690. <HI>George</HI> had the common school education of the country, from which he was removed to that of <HI>Westminster.</HI> He never had an academic edu∣cation, but was placed immediately in the inner temple, where he was chiefly supported by his grand-mother.</P>
<P>HE was never regularly called to the bar. The accident of the plague in the neighborhood of <HI>London</HI> first introduced him into his profession; for, in 1666, he put on a law-gown, and pleading at the <HI>Kingston</HI> assizes, where few counsel chose to at∣tend, he from that time acted without any notice being taken of his obtrusion. About this time, he made clandestine addresses to the daughter of a wealthy merchant; in which he was assisted by a young lady, the daughter of a clergyman. The affair was discovered, and the confidante turned out of doors. <HI>Jefferies,</HI> with a generosity unknown to him in his prosperous days, took pity and married her. She proved an excellent wife, and lived to see him lord chief justice of <HI>England.</HI> On her death he married the widow of Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> of <HI>Montgomeryshire,</HI> and daughter to Sir <HI>Thomas Blodworth.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="298" REF="335"/>HIS first preferment from the court was that of a <HI>Welsh</HI> judge. In 1680, he was made chief justice of <HI>Chester.</HI> After this, he rose with great rapidity; and, as is well known, fell as suddenly. His conduct, as chancellor, was upright and able; as a politi∣cian, unrestrained by any principle; devoted to the worst mea∣sures of an infatuated court. He was extremely given to the bottle; and paid so little respect to his character, that one day having drank to excess with the lord treasurer and others, they were going to strip, and get upon a sign-post to drink the king's health, had not they been prevented <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Reresby</HI>'s Memoirs, 231.</NOTE>. He died soon after his commitment, either from hard-drinking or a bro∣ken heart, and so was preserved from the infamy of public execution.</P>
<P>GRESFORD or <HI>Croes-ffordd, the road of the cross,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">GRESFORD:</NOTE> lies about two miles further.

<P>HE appears to have had a liberal education. His ambition overcame the prejudices of his country against the <HI>English;</HI> and determined him to seek preferment among them. He entered himself in the inns of court, and studied there, till he became a barrister. It is probable, that he quitted his profession; for we find, that he was appointed <HI>scutiger,</HI> or squire of the body to <HI>Richard</HI> II. whose fortunes he followed to the last; was taken with him in <HI>Flint</HI> castle; and, when the king's houshold was dis∣solved, retired, with full resentment of his sovereign's wrongs, to his patrimony in <HI>Wales.</HI> I judge that he was knighted before the deposal of his master; for I find him among the witnesses in the celebrated cause between Sir <HI>Richard le Scrope</HI> and Sir <HI>Ro∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> le Grosvenour,</HI> about a coat of arms, under the title of Sir <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> de Glendore.</HI> His brother also appears there by the name of <HI>Tudor de Glendore.</HI> This cause lasted three years, and ended in 1389 <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Collins</HI>'s Peerage, vii. 507.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="305" REF="342"/>JOLO GOCH,<NOTE PLACE="marg">HIS HOUSE.</NOTE> the celebrated poet of this period, resided here for some time. He came on a pressing invitation from <HI>Owen;</HI> who, knowing the mighty influence of this or∣der of men over the antient <HI>Britons,</HI> made his house, as <HI>Jolo</HI> says, a sanctuary for bards. He made them the instru∣ments of his future operations, and to prepare the minds of the people against the time of his intended insurrec∣tion. From <HI>Jolo</HI> I borrow the description of the seat of the chieftain, when it was in full splendor. He compares it, in point of magnificence, to <HI>Westminster</HI> abby; and informs us, that it had a gate-house, and was surrounded with a moat.</P>
<P>THAT within were nine halls, each furnished with a ward∣robe; I imagine, filled with the cloaths of his retainers, accor∣ding to the custom of those days.</P>
<P>NEAR the house, on a verdant bank, was a wooden house, supported on posts, and covered with tiles. It contained four apartments, each subdivided into two, designed to lodge the guests.</P>
<P>HERE was a church in form of a cross, with several cha∣pels.</P>
<P>THE seat was surrounded with every conveniency for good living; and every support to hospitality: a park, warren, and pigeon-house; a mill, orchard, and vineyard; and fish-pond, filled with pike and gwyniads. The last introduced from the lake at <HI>Bala.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="306" REF="343"/>A HERONRY, which was a concomitant to the seat of every great man, supplied him and his guests with game for the sport of falconry.</P>
<P>A PLACE still remains, that retains the name of his park. It extends about a mile or two beyond the site of his house, on the left-hand of the valley.</P>
<P>THE vestiges of the house are small. The moat is very ap∣parent: the measurement of the area it inclosed, is forty-six paces by twenty-six. There is the appearance of a wall on the outside, which was continued to the top of a great mount, on which stood the wooden house. On the other side, but at a greater distance, I had passed by another mount of the same kind, called <HI>Hêndom;</HI> which probably might have had formerly a building similar to that described by the bard. This, per∣haps, was the station of a guard, to prevent surprize or insult from the <HI>English</HI> side. He had much to apprehend from the neighboring fortress of <HI>Dinas Brân,</HI> and its appendages, possessed by the earl of <HI>Arundel,</HI> a strenuous supporter of the house of <HI>Lancaster.</HI></P>
<P>THE bard speaks feelingly of the wine, the ale, the braget, and the white bread; nor does he forget the kitchen, nor the important officer the cook; whose life (when in the royal service) was estimated by our laws at a hundred and twenty-six cows <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Leges Wallicae.</NOTE>. Such was the hospitality of this house, that the place of porter was useless; nor were locks or bolts known. To sum up all, no one could be hungry or dry in <HI>Sycharth,</HI> the name of the place.</P>

<P>'Her father was a potent prince. All <HI>Wales</HI> was in his council.'</P>
<P><PB N="309" REF="346"/>I MUST not omit notice of a mistake of the <HI>English</HI> historians, who mention the marriage of another daughter of <HI>Glyndwr</HI> to <HI>Edmund</HI> earl of <HI>March.</HI> This, they assert, was also effected by force, after the earl became his prisoner: but it does not appear that he ever was <HI>Glyndwr</HI>'s captive; or that <HI>March</HI> had any other wife than <HI>Anne</HI> †, daughter to <HI>Edmund</HI> earl of <HI>Stafford;</HI> besides, the <HI>Welsh</HI> histories are totally silent on that head.</P>
<P>SUCH was the state of the domestic affairs of <HI>Glyndwr</HI> at the change of government in 1399. His resentment against the usurper was whetted by wrongs public and private: by the murder of the unhappy <HI>Richard,</HI> to whom he was strongly attach∣ed by being a personal favorite; and by the strong partiality the <HI>Welsh</HI> had for their late king.</P>
<P>IN the very first year or the new reign, he experienced the frowns of the court.<NOTE PLACE="marg">OPPRESSED BY LORD GREY.</NOTE> <HI>Reginald</HI> lord <HI>Grey</HI> of <HI>Ruthyn,</HI> taking ad∣vantage of the deposal of <HI>Richard,</HI> instantly seized on a certain common, called <HI>Croeseu,</HI> which <HI>Glyndwr,</HI> in a former reign, had recovered from him by course of law. <HI>Owen</HI> fought justice without having recourse to violence: he laid his case be∣fore parlement; but his suit was dismissed without re∣dress.</P>
<P>THIS insult was aggravated by another injury. When <HI>Henry</HI> went on his expedition against the <HI>Scots, Owen</HI> was to have been summoned, among other barons, to attend the king with his vassals. The writ for that purpose was delivered to <HI>Reginald</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Visa Ricardi, ii. 171.</NOTE>, who designedly neglected to deliver it till the time was nearly
<PB N="310" REF="347"/>
elapsed, and it became impossible for him to obey. <HI>Regineld</HI> returned to the king, and misrepresented the absence of <HI>O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>n</HI> as an act of wilful disobedience; and, by this piece of treachery, took possession of all his land; and on this, under pretence of forfeiture, invaded such parts of <HI>Glyndwr</HI>'s estates as lay adjacent to his own.</P>
<P>THE danger of driving into desperate measures a person of his interest, spirit, and abilities, was foreseen by <HI>John Trevor</HI> bishop of St. <HI>Asaph,</HI> who advised more temperate proceedings; that <HI>Owen</HI> was by no means a despicable enemy; and that the <HI>W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lsh</HI> would certainly be provoked into a general insurrection. His advice was rejected, and he was told there could be no fear about such a bare-footed rabble<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Leland's <HI>Collect.</HI> i. 310.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IT does not appear that <HI>Glyndwr,</HI> till this period, had any settled design of flinging off the <HI>English</HI> yoke. Ambition now came in, and joined with his revenge.<NOTE PLACE="marg">ASSERTS HIS CLAME TO WALES.</NOTE> He revolved in his mind his own genealogy: he derived himself from the antient race of <HI>British</HI> princes; and, apparently laying aside all sense of private wrong, made open clame to the throne of <HI>Wales.</HI> To encou∣rage his countrymen, strongly attached to the prophecies of an∣tient times, he reminded them of those of <HI>Merlin</HI> and other sages. His bards set before them the great qualities of their leader; and taught them to expect from his valor and con∣duct, the freedom of antient <HI>Britons</HI> from the galling weight of the <HI>Saxon</HI> yoke.

<P>He first appeared in arms in the summer of the year 1400<NOTE PLACE="marg">APPEARS IN ARMS</NOTE>. He naturally directed his attack against the lands of his enemy lord <HI>Grey;</HI> and immediately recovered what he had unjustly been dispossessed of, during the absence of the former. As soon as the news reached <HI>Henry,</HI> he sent lord <HI>Talbot</HI> and lord <HI>Grey</HI> to reduce him. They arrived with such speed, that they surrounded his house before he had any notice; but he had the good fortune to escape into the woods. He immediately raised a powerful band of men; and, after causing himself to be proclamed prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> on the 20th of <HI>September,</HI> surprized, plundered, and burnt to the ground the town of <HI>Ruthyn,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">BURNS RUTHYN.</NOTE> at the time a fair was held

there. After which he retired to his fastnesses among the moun∣tains. One, I imagine to have been the great strength, sur∣rounded by a vast rampart of stones, near <HI>Corwen,</HI> called <HI>Caer Drewyn.</HI></P>
<P>HENRY,<NOTE PLACE="marg">FIRST MARCH OF HENRY AGAINST HIM.</NOTE> determined to suppress this revolt in the beginning, marched in person against <HI>Owen,</HI> and penetrated as far as the isle of <HI>Anglesea,</HI> putting to the sword all that resisted. He plun∣dered the convent of <HI>Llanvaes</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Leland's <HI>Collect.</HI> i. 311.</NOTE>; slew some of the monks, and took the rest away with him; at length set them at liberty, and made restitution to the monastery; but peopled it again with <HI>English</HI> religious. The monks of <HI>Llanvaes</HI> had been <HI>Franciscans;</HI> an order who were firm adherents to the late prince; and who, in general, were suspected of promoting the insurrection of Glyn∣dwr, and even of inviting him to invade <HI>England.</HI> This occa∣sioned a persecution of them, and several<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE> were executed on that account. Their intelligence with <HI>Glyndwr</HI> is very evident from the favor he shewed the order on the taking of <HI>Cardiff,</HI> in the year 1402; when he burnt the whole town, excepting the street inhabited by the Franciscans<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Idem, 313.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE king returned without effecting any material action; for, on his approach, <HI>Owen</HI> retired among the Snowdon hills<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Holinshed, 519.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE proclamation for assembling the forces for this expedi∣tion, was dated on the 19th of <HI>September,</HI> from <HI>Northampton,</HI> and addressed to the lieutenants of <HI>Warwickshire, Leicester,</HI> and
<PB N="317" REF="354"/>
eight other counties; in which all persons capable of bearing arms, within their jurisdiction, were directed to array themselves, and be ready to march to such place as his majesty directed; who acquaints the lieutenants, that he should lie at <HI>Coventry</HI> on his road to <HI>Wales</HI> the <HI>Monday</HI> following<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Rymer</HI>'s Foedera, viii. 159.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>ON the same day he issued out an order to the bailifss and good people of <HI>Shrewsbury,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">SHREWSBURY SE∣CURED BY HENRY:</NOTE> to take proper steps to secure that important place; and that they oblige all the <HI>Welsh</HI> resident in the town, to give security for their loyal behaviour; and in case of refusal, to commit them to prison<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Idem, 160.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>ON the eighth of <HI>November</HI> in the same year,<NOTE PLACE="marg">WHO GRANTS OWEN'S ESTATES TO THE EARL OF SOMERSET;</NOTE> he made a grant of all the estates of <HI>Glyndwr,</HI> in <HI>North</HI> and <HI>South Wales,</HI> to his brother <HI>John</HI> earl of <HI>Somerset</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Idem, 163.</NOTE>; an act as weak as it was irri∣tating: for <HI>Owen</HI> was so far from being in any danger of be∣ing dispossessed of them, that at this very time he was growing more powerful by the accession of new forces. It is remark∣able, that his revenue in money at this period did not exceed three hundred marks; which shewed that his rents in kind must have been very considerable.</P>
<P>BUT the last public act of this year was conciliating.<NOTE PLACE="marg">AND OZERRS PAR∣DON TO THE WELSH.</NOTE> The king made one endeavour to bring back the <HI>Welsh</HI> to their al∣legiance by fair means; and for that end issued a proclamation, on the 30th of <HI>November,</HI> offering to take under his protec∣tion all that would resort to the city of <HI>Chester,</HI> and there make their submission to his son <HI>Henry</HI> prince of <HI>Wales;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">PRINCE HENRY FIRST APPEARS.</NOTE> after which they should be at liberty to return to their respective

<P>1401</P>
<P>THE first half of this year passed without any memorable action.<NOTE PLACE="marg">OWEN AUGMENTS HIS FORCES.</NOTE> <HI>Owen</HI> was busied in augmenting his forces; he made considerable levies in <HI>Wales;</HI> and received continual addition to his strength, by the great resort of his countrymen of all orders, who had gone into <HI>England</HI> for the sake of education, or to gain a livelihood by different occupations.</P>
<P>THE state of <HI>Henry's</HI> affairs,<NOTE PLACE="marg">STATE OF HEN∣EY'S AFFAIRS AT THIS TIME.</NOTE> in respect to the <HI>European</HI> mo∣narchs, the badness of his title to the crown of <HI>England,</HI> and the repentance of several of the great men for their disloy∣alty to their late prince, were circumstances highly in favor of <HI>Glyndwr.</HI></P>
<P>CHARLES VI. of <HI>France,</HI> father-in-law to the unhappy <HI>Rich∣ard,</HI> prepared to revenge his deposal and murder. The confu∣sion of his own affairs, luckily for <HI>Henry,</HI> prevented the resent∣ment of the <HI>French</HI> monarch. He contented himself with re∣ceiving back, his daughter <HI>Isabel,</HI> and her <HI>paraphernalia:</HI> and <HI>Henry</HI> gladly renewed a truce with him for thirty years.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Scots</HI> taking advantage of his situation, threatened him with invasion. This made it dangerous for him to engage in a distant war, and obliged him to continue for a considerable time in the central parts of his dominion, to act according to the ne∣cessity
<PB N="319" REF="356"/>
of events. In respect to the <HI>Welsh,</HI> he contented himself with issuing out pardons<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rymer, viii. 181, 182.</NOTE>, (at the instance of prince <HI>Henry,</HI>) to all that had appeared in arms in the counties of <HI>Caernarvon, Anglesey,</HI> and <HI>Flint,</HI> and the people of <HI>Denbigh</HI> and <HI>Merioneth;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">HENRY OFFERS NEW PARDONS.</NOTE> to the in∣habitants of <HI>Chirkland, Bromfield,</HI> and <HI>Yale;</HI> to the hundred of <HI>Oswestry;</HI> and to those of <HI>Ellesmere</HI> and <HI>Whittington;</HI> which I find were then reckoned parts of <HI>Wales. Owen</HI> himleif, <HI>Rice ap Tudor, William ap Tudor,</HI> and all such as were in actual custody, or such who should continue in arms, were excepted. The first pardon was given out the 10th of <HI>May,</HI> the latest, the 5th of <HI>June,</HI> and, as will appear, with some effect.</P>
<P>GLYNDWR's fortune and interest lay, as was before mentioned, both in <HI>North</HI> and in <HI>South Wales.</HI> This summer he marched with a hundred and twenty men of arms, and, with great policy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">OWEN POSTS HIM∣SELF ON PLIN∣LIMMON.</NOTE> posted himself on <HI>Plinlimmon</HI> hill, a lofty mountain, the limits of <HI>Cardiganshire</HI> and <HI>Montgomeryshire,</HI> admirably adapted for receiving succours from his vassals and friends in each part of the princi∣pality. From hence his followers made plundering excursions, and were the terror of all that declined espousing his cause. The county of <HI>Montgomery</HI> suffered greatly.<NOTE PLACE="marg">PLUNDERS MONT∣GOMERY.</NOTE> He sacked the capital town<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Leland Itin. v. 4.</NOTE>, burnt the suburbs of <HI>Pool,</HI> and ravaged all the borders. He destroyed the abby of <HI>Comhere</HI> in <HI>Radnorshire;</HI> took the castle of <HI>Radnor,</HI> and caused the whole garrison, to the number of three∣score,<NOTE PLACE="marg">BEHEADS SIXTY MEN.</NOTE> to be beheaded on the brink of the castle-yard<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. The provocation to this piece of cruelty does not appear.</P>
<P><PB N="320" REF="357"/>THE <HI>Flemings,</HI> inhabitants of <HI>Ross, Pembroke,</HI> and <HI>Cardigan∣shire,</HI> suffered so greatly from <HI>Glyndwr,</HI> that they determined to attempt to remove so troublesome a neighbour.<NOTE PLACE="marg">SURPRISED;</NOTE> They assembled a body of fifteen hundred men, and made so expeditious a march, as to surround <HI>Owen</HI> and his forces, at a place called <HI>Mynydd Hyddgant,</HI> before he had any notice of their approach. They hemmed him in on every side; and, notwithstanding he could make no retreat without great disadvantage, he made a long; and manful defence. At length, finding it impossible to subsist in that place, he determined to cut a passage through the enemy, or perish in the attempt.<NOTE PLACE="marg">YET DEFEATS THE ENEMY.</NOTE> He knew that neither he nor his men were to expect any mercy; so, actuated by despair, they fell furiously on the <HI>Flemings,</HI> and, after a strong dispute, flung them into great disorder; which <HI>Owen</HI> taking advantage of, redoubled his attack, and at length put them to night, leaving two hundred of their party dead on the spot.</P>
<P>THIS victory added greatly to the reputation of <HI>Glyndwr.</HI> Mul∣titudes resorted to his standard, and contributed to make him a most formidable enemy.</P>
<P>HENRY, alarmed at his successes, marched a second time in per∣son.<NOTE PLACE="marg">HENRY'S SECOND MARCH.</NOTE> He entered <HI>Wales</HI> with a great army about the beginning of <HI>June</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vita <HI>R.</HI> II. 174.</NOTE>, destroyed the abby of <HI>Strathfleur</HI> in <HI>Cardiganshire,</HI> and ravaged the country; but was obliged to make a disgraceful retreat, after his forces had suffered greatly by famine, and the great fatigues they continually underwent.</P>
<P><PB N="321" REF="358"/>THE monk of <HI>Evesham</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vita R. ii. 174</NOTE> relates an instance of paternal affec∣tion, much to the honor of our country.

<P>IT is probable,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CORRUPTS SOME OF OWEN'S FRIENDS.</NOTE> that during this expedition <HI>Henry</HI> found means to corrupt the fidelity of several of the friends of <HI>Glyndwr;</HI> for we find a free pardon granted to <HI>William ap Tudor,</HI> (a gentleman who had been excepted in the pardon of last year) and to thirty-one principal persons of the country.

<P>THIS defection seemed to have very little effect on the spirit of <HI>Glyndwr.</HI> He acquired new friends, and such addition of strength, that the king resolved to go again in person against him. He issued out his orders to the lieutenants of <HI>Devonshire,</HI> and one and twenty other counties, to repair with their forces to <HI>Wor∣cester</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ibid, 225.</NOTE> on the first of <HI>October.</HI> Our old historians are silent about the event of this expedition; but Mr. <HI>Carte</HI> says, that it was un∣fortunate as the former.<NOTE PLACE="marg">MAKES A THIRD EXPEDITION.</NOTE> Thus concluded the transactions of this year.</P>
<P>1402.</P>
<P>THIS year was ushered in with a comet,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A COMET.</NOTE> or blazing-star; which the bards interpreted as an omen favourable to the cause of <HI>Glyn∣dwr.</HI> It served to infuse spirit into the minds of a superstitious
<PB N="322" REF="359"/>
people: the first success of their chieftain confirmed their belief, and gave new vigor to their actions.</P>
<P>LORD GREY was the first that felt the effects of <HI>Owen's</HI> power. That nobleman, strongly attached to <HI>Henry,</HI> and impatient of the injuries which he and his friends received from <HI>Glyndwr,</HI> raised a considerable army; encountered him; was defeated, and made prisoner.<NOTE PLACE="marg">OWEN DEFEATS LORD GREY.</NOTE> Historians differ about the scene of action. The <HI>Welsh</HI> lay it on the banks of the <HI>Fyrnwy,</HI> in the county of <HI>Montgo∣mery.</HI> The <HI>English</HI> say that it was in the neighborhood of <HI>Ru∣thyn;</HI> and that <HI>Owen</HI> advancing towards the castle with a party of men, drew his incautious rival into the field, where he fell into an ambush, and was taken, and carried fast bound into confinement, amidst the savage fastnesses of the <HI>Snowdon</HI> hills<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vita <HI>Ricardi</HI> II. 178.</NOTE>. This relation seems probable, not only as the castle of <HI>Ruthyn</HI> was the chief seat of lord <HI>Grey,</HI> but a fortress of such strength as to baffle all attempts of <HI>Glyndwr,</HI> in the infancy of his insur∣rection, without having recourse to stratagem.</P>
<P>LORD GREY remained for a long time in captivity,<NOTE PLACE="marg">MAKES HIM PAY A GREAT RANSOM</NOTE> nor did he gain his liberty till he paid to him the vast sum of ten thou∣sand marks. He was such a personal favorite with the king, who, pitying the severity with which he was treated, and ad∣miring the firmness with which he resisted the offers of <HI>Glyndwr</HI> to make him swerve from his loyalty, that his majesty issued out a special commission, dated the 10th of <HI>October</HI> in this year, empowering Sir <HI>William de Roos,</HI> Sir <HI>Richard de Grey,</HI> Sir <HI>William de Willughby,</HI> Sir <HI>William de Zouch, John Henry, William Vans,</HI>
<PB N="323" REF="360"/>
<HI>John Lee, John Longford, Thomas Payne,</HI> and <HI>John Elnstow,</HI> to treat with <HI>Owen</HI> and his council about the ransom. It was agreed to pay six thousand marks on the day of St. <HI>Martin</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rymer, viii. 279.</NOTE> following, and give, as hostages for the payment of the remainder, his eldest son, and some other persons. And, in order to raise the money, <HI>Henry</HI> gave licence to <HI>Robert Braybrook</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Dagdale's Baron. i. 717.</NOTE> bishop of <HI>London,</HI> and two others, feoffees of divers lordships for lord <HI>Grey,</HI> to sell the lordship of <HI>Herteleigh</HI> in <HI>Kent.</HI> He also absolved him for six years from the forfeiture of two-thirds of the profits of his <HI>Irish</HI> estates, usually exacted from such who were non-resident in that kingdom.</P>
<P>AFTER this he was set at liberty, and he and his tenants suf∣fered to enjoy their property without molestation. It is probable, that <HI>Owen</HI> engaged his lordship to observe a neutrality, as another term of redemption. Lord <HI>Grey</HI> seemed likewise to think it necessary to secure both his people and himself by an alliance with <HI>Owen;</HI> for no sooner was he released, than he married <HI>Jane,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">AND MARRY ONE OF HIS DAUGH∣TERS.</NOTE> third daughter of the furious chieftain. He had no issue by this lady. The match was probably compulsive; at best, political. Some of the <HI>English</HI> historians pretend that he died in captivity: but that he obtained his liberty, and long survived this treaty, is evident: for in 1409, he was ordered by <HI>Henry</HI> to his estates, to repel the ravages his father-in-law made on the borders. He even lived to serve in the <HI>French</HI> wars in the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> V. and his successor, and died in the year 1440<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Collins's Peerage, ii. 382.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="324" REF="361"/>OWEN, after securing this potent enemy, began to give a free rein to his revenge; to punish such of his countrymen whom he considered as traitors to the generous cause of freedom, by an unnatural adherence to the <HI>English,</HI> whose yoke they had borne for such a length of time.</P>

<P>HOWEL SELE of <HI>Nannau</HI> in <HI>Merionethshire,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">STORY OR HOWEL SELE.</NOTE> first cousin to <HI>Owen,</HI> had a harder fate. He likewise was an adherent to the house of <HI>Lancaster. Owen</HI> and this chieftain had been long at variance. I have been informed, that the abbot of <HI>Kymmer,</HI> near <HI>Dolgellu,</HI> in hopes of reconciling them, brought them together, and to all appearance effected his charitable design. While they were walk∣ing out, <HI>Owen</HI> observed a doe feeding, and told <HI>Howel,</HI> who was reckoned the best archer of his days, that there was a fine mark for him. <HI>Howel</HI> bent his bow, and, pretending to aim at the doe, suddenly turned and discharged the arrow full at the breast of <HI>Glyndwr,</HI> who fortunately had armour beneath his cloaths, so received no hurt. Enraged at this treachery, he seized on <HI>Sole,</HI> burnt his house, and hurried him away from the place; nor could ever any one learn how he was disposed of: till, forty
<PB N="325" REF="362"/>
years after, the skeleton of a large man, such as <HI>Howel,</HI> was dis∣covered in the hollow of a great oak, in which <HI>Owen</HI> was sup∣posed to have immured him in reward of his persidy. The ruins of the old house are to be seen in <HI>Nannau</HI> park, a mere compost of cinders and ashes.</P>
<P>IT must be observed, that when <HI>Owen</HI> was carrying him away, his relation <HI>Gryffydd ap Gwyn,</HI> of <HI>Ganllwyd</HI> in <HI>Ardudwy,</HI> attempted his rescue, but was defeated with the loss of numbers of his men, and of his houses of <HI>Berthlwyd</HI> and <HI>Cesn Coch,</HI> which were burnt to ashes.</P>
<P>IT was about this period that <HI>Owen</HI> wreaked his revenge on the ecclesiastics who had favored the cause of the <HI>English.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">BURNS ST.

<P>HENRY considered him as a sufferer in his cause; therefore gave power to the bishops of <HI>Hereford, Voltorno,</HI> and <HI>Bangor,</HI> to suffer him to hold in <HI>commendam</HI> the living of <HI>Meivod,</HI> with the chapels of <HI>Pool</HI> and <HI>Kegidva,</HI> or <HI>Guilsfield,</HI> in order to support his dignity during the ravage of his diocese<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Rymer,</HI> viii.222.246; the bishop of <HI>Voltorno</HI> probably acted as the pope's legate.</NOTE>.</P>

Owen,</HI> after the defeat of lord <HI>Grey,</HI> pursued his resentment against all the chieftains unfavorable to his de∣signs; advanced with his army towards <HI>Herefordshire,</HI> and the borders of <HI>South Wales;</HI> and carried fire and sword through the lands of his opponents. None suffered so severely as the vassals and tenants of <HI>Edward Mortimer</HI> earl of <HI>March,</HI> a child of ten years of age, who, with his brother <HI>Roger,</HI> was in the custody of the king at that time. <HI>Henry</HI> was very sensible of the just title this child had to the crown, being desended from <HI>Lionel</HI> duke of <HI>Clarence,</HI> third son to <HI>Edward</HI> III. His title had even been acknowleged in parlement. This increased his majesty's apprehensions, and made him consider the misfortunes of that family the strengthening of his own throne.</P>
<P>SIR EDMUND MORTIMER, uncle to this youth, unable any longer to bear the depredations of <HI>Owen,</HI> collected a large body of his nephew's tenants and retainers out of the county of <HI>Here∣ford,</HI> and the adjacent parts, particularly from <HI>Melienydd</HI> in <HI>Radnorshire,</HI> and with these marched against the invader. A bloody action ensued on <HI>Bryn-glas,</HI> a mountain near <HI>Pilleth,</HI> a little south-west of <HI>Knighton,</HI> in <HI>Radnorshire.</HI> Victory de∣clared in favor of our countryman. Some writers assert, that the archers of <HI>Mortimer</HI>'s army bent their bows against their own party<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Stow, 327.</NOTE>. Another says<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Vita <HI>Ricardi</HI> II. 178.</NOTE>, that <HI>March</HI>'s <HI>Welsh</HI> tenants took
<PB N="328" REF="365"/>
to flight at the first onset, and occasioned the defeat. The loss chiefly fell on the people of <HI>Herefordshire.</HI> Eleven hundred fell on the side of <HI>Mortimer.</HI> <Q>The shamefull villanie used by the <HI>Welshwomen</HI> towards the dead carcasses,</Q> says <HI>Holinshed,</HI> <Q>was such as honest eares would be ashamed to heare, and continent toongs to speak thereof.

<P>SHAKESPEAR flings a fine horror over this dreadful tale, in relating,</P>
<Q><L>When, all athwart there came</L>
<L>A post from <HI>Wales</HI> loaden with heavy news;</L>
<L>Whose worst was, that the noble <HI>Mortimir,</HI></L>
<L>Leading the men of <HI>Herefordshire</HI> to fight</L>
<L>Against the irregular and wild <HI>Glendower,</HI></L>
<L>Was by the rude hands of that <HI>Welshman</HI> taken;</L>
<L>A thousand of his people butchered,</L>
<L>Upon whose dead corpse there was such misuse,</L>
<L>Sach beastly, shameless transformation</L>
<L>By those <HI>Welshwomen</HI> done, as may not be,</L>
<L>Without much shame, re-told or spoken of.</L></Q>
<P>I WISH I could exculpate my countrywomen from this heavy charge. It originates from <HI>Thomas de Walsmgham,</HI> an historian who, it must be confessed, wrote within forty years of this event. To his authority I beg leave to oppose that of another antient writer, who ascribes these barbarities to a follower of <HI>Glyndwr,</HI>
<PB N="329" REF="366"/>
one <HI>Rees a Gyrch</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vita <HI>Ricardi,</HI> 175.</NOTE>. I flatter myself that this was the case; for, had it been otherwise, it would have been totally unnecessary to discourage the <HI>English,</HI> by an express law<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Statute 4th <HI>Henry</HI> IV. c. 34.</NOTE>, from marrying with such furies as the <HI>Welshwomen</HI> were represented to have been.</P>
<P>MANY historians pretend, that the young earl of <HI>March</HI> was present at this defeat; was made prisoner; and, to ensure his allegiance, obliged to marry a daughter of <HI>Glyndwr.</HI> But at this time he endured another species of confinement at <HI>Windsor:</HI> his uncle commanded the forces of the family,<NOTE PLACE="marg">TAKES PRISONER SIR EDMUND MORTIMER</NOTE> and lost his liberty in the battle. Great instances were made to <HI>Henry</HI> for leave to ransom him; but the jealous king, rejoicing in the misfortunes of this rival house, suffered him to continue in the power of his enemy; alleging, that Sir <HI>Edmund</HI> had treacher∣ously flung himself into the hands of <HI>Glyndwr.</HI></P>
<P>AFTER this victory, <HI>Glyndwr</HI> received from all parts of <HI>Wales</HI> accession of strength. Notwithstanding <HI>Henry</HI> was indifferent about the fate of the <HI>Mortimers,</HI> his own safety now required him to act with vigor. The design of assembling his army at <HI>Lichfield</HI> was laid aside. New writs were issued out, dated the 31st of <HI>July.</HI> It was resolved to distract the <HI>Welsh</HI> by three in∣vasions from different quarters. The rendevous of the first army was to be at <HI>Shrewshury,</HI> to be commanded by the king in person; the second at <HI>Hereford,</HI> to be assembled by <HI>Edmund</HI> earl of <HI>Stafford, Richard</HI> earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI> and the lords <HI>Grey, Alergavenny, Audeley,</HI> and <HI>Berkly;</HI> and the third, under the con∣duct
<PB N="330" REF="367"/>
of prince <HI>Henry,</HI> at <HI>Chester.</HI> The forces were to be assem∣bled at each place by the 27th of <HI>August</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rymer, viii. 271.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>OWEN, assured that these preparations could not take effect till a certain time, gave loose to his resentment, in the beginning of <HI>August,</HI> against the inhabitants of <HI>Glamorganshire,</HI> who had sided with the <HI>English.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">RAVAGES GLA∣MORGANSHIRE.</NOTE> He marched into that county, ravaged it on all parts; and, after burning the bishop's castle and the arch∣deacon's house<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Willis's Llandaff, 30, 31.</NOTE> at <HI>Llandaff,</HI> in the same inroad he likewise burnt <HI>Cardiff</HI> and <HI>Abergavenny;</HI> and then returned to make head against the <HI>English.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>Scots,</HI> at this time, took advantage of the commotions of the <HI>Welsh;</HI> and, under the command of the great <HI>Douglas,</HI> invaded <HI>England</HI> with a body of twelve or thirteen thousand men. It is almost certain, that they acted in concert with <HI>Glyndwr.</HI> Both nations were united in a common hatred of the <HI>English.</HI> Both had felt the weight of their power. The <HI>Scots meditated</HI> their inroad at the very time that <HI>Henry</HI> had drawn his forces to the borders of <HI>Wales,</HI> and, as they hoped, left the northern bor∣ders unguarded. <HI>Henry</HI> had intelligence, that it was to take place on the assumption of the blessed Virgin, or the 15th of <HI>August;</HI> and, in order to defeat it, directed the lieutenant of the county of <HI>Lincoln</HI> to hasten towards the north, with all the men he could raise.</P>
<P>HENRY,<NOTE PLACE="marg">HENRY'S FOURTH MARCH.</NOTE> during this time, proceeded on his expedition against the <HI>Welsh.</HI> It does not appear whether the army under his son, and that under the earl of <HI>Arundel</HI> (on whom the command of the
<PB N="331" REF="368"/>
second army was bestowed) made separate diversions into differ∣ent parts of the country in his favor; or whether he united their forces with his own. The event of his invasion was very unfor∣tunate. <HI>Glyndwr,</HI> who had too much prudence to hazard a battle against so superior an army, retired to the fastnesses of the mountains; and drove away the cattle, and destroyed every means the <HI>English</HI> had of subsistence. The season proved uncommonly bad; for the very elements seem to have warred against them.<NOTE PLACE="marg">UNSUCCESSFUL.</NOTE> A continued course of storms and rains, with the continual watching against an enemy ever hovering over them, and ready to take every occasion of falling on them from the heights, wasted the army with sickness and fatigue; and obliged the king once more to make a most inglorious retreat.</P>
<P>THE <HI>English,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">OWEN REPUTED A MAGICIAN.</NOTE> willing to cover their shame, attributed the cause of their disgrace to the incantations of the <HI>British</HI> chieftain; 'who,' as an old historian expresses, <Q>through art magike (as was thought) caused such foule weather of winds, tempest, raine, snow, and haile, to be raised for the annoiance of the king's armie, that the like had not beene heard of.</Q> Perhaps <HI>Glyndwr,</HI> as well to infuse terror into his foes, as to give his people a more exalted notion of him, might politically insi∣nuate his skill in spells and charms, that they might suppose him aided by more than mortal power. This species of credu∣lity was not only strong at this time, but even continued to more enlightened days.</P>
<P>OWEN, by the mouth of <HI>Shakespear,</HI> speaks thus of his in∣tercourse with the tribe of spints, and of his skill in the mystic arts of divination:</P>
<Q><PB N="332" REF="369"/>
<L>Where is he living, clipt in with the sea</L>
<L>That chides the banks of <HI>England, Wales,</HI> or <HI>Scotland,</HI></L>
<L>Who calls me pupil, or has read to me?</L>
<L>And bring him out, that is but woman's son,</L>
<L>Can trace me in the tedious ways of art,</L>
<L>Or hold me pace in deep experiments.</L>
<L>I can call spirits from the vasty deep!</L></Q>
<P>THE poet, on this occasion, plays finely with the warmth of <HI>Glyndwr;</HI> and draws from him that characteristic spirit of our country, which is nobly prompt to rise on the appearance, or sometimes even on the very apprehension of insult.</P>
<P>HENRY quickly received news from the north, that served to alleviate the ill success of his invasion. The earl of <HI>Northum∣berland,</HI> and other northern barons, had assembled their forces to oppose the <HI>Scots,</HI> then on their return home; overtook them on <HI>Holyrood</HI>-day, or the 15th of <HI>September,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">BATTLE OF HO∣MELDON:</NOTE> on <HI>Homeldon</HI> hill near <HI>Wooler,</HI> and gained over them a complete victory. Numbers of the <HI>Scotch</HI> nobility were slain in the fight; and numbers taken, among whom was their gallant commander <HI>Archibald</HI> earl or <HI>Douglas,</HI> styled by his countrymen <HI>Tyneman,</HI> from the loss of men that attended him in all his conflicts.</P>
<P>THIS battle was productive of great events; and proved in the end the destruction of the <HI>Percy</HI> family. It was usual for the prisoners to fall to the share of the victors; and that each person who was fortunate or brave enough to make a captive, should receive the reward of his valor, by having liberty to ran∣som him, according to his rank or abilities.<NOTE PLACE="marg">ITS CONSE∣QUENCES.</NOTE> <HI>Henry Percy</HI> sur∣named <HI>Hotspur,</HI> had himself, by the fortune of war, been made
<PB N="333" REF="370"/>
prisoner by the <HI>Scots,</HI> and was redeemed according to the antient custom of arms. The victors at this time expected and clamed the same right; but <HI>Henry,</HI> wishing to detain, as hostages for the peaceable conduct of the <HI>Scottish</HI> nation, these illustrious captives, sent directions to the earl of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> that he should by no means set them at liberty; but that he should deliver them to him. <HI>Henry</HI> softened this demand by rewarding <HI>Northumber∣land</HI> with a considerable grant of lands on the borders of <HI>Scot∣land</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rymer, viii. 289.</NOTE>; and parlement even sent him a letter of thanks for his good services.<NOTE PLACE="marg">THE PERCIES DIS∣CONTENTED;</NOTE> Notwithstanding this, the <HI>Percies</HI> were greatly dissatisfied. Whether their high spirit resented the invasion of the antient title of victors to their prisoners; or whether they were seized with remorse for their disloyalty to their former master; or whether they were actuated by the ambition of be∣coming independent; or whether all these causes might not co∣operate, is not very certain; yet, from this time, they formed their design of flinging off their allegiance to <HI>Henry.</HI></P>
<P>A GREAT discontent with his government at this period began to seize the nation. The affection for the murdered <HI>Richard</HI> revived. So willing were the people to imagine him still alive, that the many reports invented on that subject were greedily swallowed; and a proneness to revolt almost generally ap∣peared.</P>
<P>THE first step taken by the <HI>Percies,</HI> was the release of the <HI>Scottish</HI> prisoners without ransom.<NOTE PLACE="marg">RELEASE THEIR PRISONERS.</NOTE> This gained the heart of <HI>Douglas;</HI> who went home, raised a body of men, and joined in the enterprize.</P>
<P><PB N="334" REF="371"/>SIR EDMUND MORTIMER,<NOTE PLACE="marg">GLYNDWR SETS MORTIMER AT LIBERTY.</NOTE> from the time of his defeat, was treated with the utmost humanity and respect. <HI>Glyndwr,</HI> politi∣cally determined to make use of this important prisoner as an instrument of his ambition, reminded him of the right of his, house to the crown of <HI>England,</HI> and flattered him with the hopes of restoring it to the throne<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vita <HI>Ricardi</HI> II. 179.</NOTE> of his ancestors. The <HI>Percies,</HI> to whom he was allied, had made frequent instances to <HI>Henry</HI> for his ransom, who, on false and injurious pretences, constantly refused attention to their request; notwithstanding, he never rested till he had procured the enlargement of his favorite, lord <HI>Grey.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>Percies</HI> now began to extend their views; and to form a confederacy that promised fair to effect another revolution. They entered into an alliance with <HI>Glyndwr;</HI> obtained the release of <HI>Mortimer;</HI> and, like the famous triumvirate of <HI>Rome,</HI> deter∣mined to divide the empire between them.</P>
<P>THEIR place of meeting,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CONSPIRACY OF THE PERCIES:</NOTE> the <HI>Mutina</HI> of these heroes, was at the house of <HI>David Daron,</HI> or of <HI>Aberdaron,</HI> dean of <HI>Bangor</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Willis's Bangor, 122.</NOTE>, son of <HI>Evan ap Dafydd ap Gryffydd,</HI> descended from <HI>Caradoc ap Jestyn,</HI> a prince of <HI>Wales.</HI> He was a man of interest and wealth; entered strongly into their views; and in consequence, in the year 1406, was outlawed for his attachment to them.</P>
<P>HERE the three chieftains formed the division of <HI>Britain.<NOTE PLACE="marg">UNITE WITH GLYNDWR.</NOTE> Sir Edmund Mortimer,</HI> in behalf of his nephew the earl of <HI>March,</HI> took all the country from the <HI>Trent</HI> and <HI>Seven</HI> to the eastern and southern limits of the island; <HI>Northumberland</HI> was to have all the
<PB N="335" REF="372"/>
counties north of the <HI>Trent;</HI> and <HI>Glyndwr</HI> every thing that lay beyond the <HI>Severn</HI> westward.</P>
<P>IT was on this occasion that <HI>Owen,</HI> to animate his country∣men, called up the antient prophecy, which predicted the de∣struction of <HI>Henry,</HI> under the name of the <HI>Moldwarp, cursed of</HI> GOD'S <HI>own mouth.</HI> Himself he styled the <HI>dragon;</HI> a name he assumed in imitatation of <HI>Uther,</HI> whose victories over the <HI>Saxons</HI> were foretold by the appearance of a star with a dragon beneath; which <HI>Uther</HI> used as his badge; and on that account it became a favorite one with the <HI>Welsh.</HI> On <HI>Percy</HI> he bestowed the title of <HI>lion,</HI> from the crest of the family; on <HI>Mortimer,</HI> that of the <HI>wolf,</HI> probably from a similar reason. And these three were to divide the realm between them.</P>
<P>GLYNDWR was now in the meridian of his glory.<NOTE PLACE="marg">CONCENTION OF THE ESTATES OF WALES.</NOTE> He assem∣bled the estates of <HI>Wales</HI> at <HI>Machynlleth,</HI> a town of <HI>Montgomery∣shire:</HI> he caused there his title to the principality to be acknow∣leged, and was formally crowned.</P>
<P>AT this meeting he narrowly escaped assassination.<NOTE PLACE="marg">DAVID GAM CON∣SPIRES AGAINST OWEN.</NOTE> Among the chieftains, who appeared to support his title, came a gentleman of <HI>Brecknockshire, David Gam,</HI> or the one-eyed; a man, says Mr. <HI>Carte</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">ii. 654.</NOTE>, who held his estate of the honor of <HI>Hereford,</HI> who had long been in the service of <HI>Bolingbrook,</HI> and was firmly at∣tached to his interest. Notwithstanding he had married a sister of <HI>Glyndwr,</HI> yet such a furious hatred had he conceived to his cause, that he appeared at the assembly with the secret and treacherous resolution of murdering his prince and brother-in-law.
<PB N="336" REF="373"/>
<HI>Carte</HI> says, that he was instigated to it by <HI>Henry;</HI> but gives no authority for his assertion. Party-zeal, or hopes of reward, probably determined him to so nefarious a deed, He was a fit instrument for the purpose: a man of unshaken cou∣rage; which was afterwards put to the proof in the following reign, at the battle of <HI>Azincourt.</HI> This was the gentleman who was sent to explore the numbers of the enemy before the action; and who informed the king, that there were <HI>enough to kill, enough to be taken prisoners, and enough to run away.</HI> In the battle, <HI>David,</HI> his son-in-law <HI>Roger Vychan,</HI> and his relation <HI>Waltar Llwyd,</HI> rescued the king, when environed with his foes. They saved his life at the expence of their own, and fell with many mortal wounds. The king, after the victory, ap∣proached the place where they lay weltering in their blood; and, in the moment of death, bestowed on them the only reward of their valor which he could confer in that sad time, the ho∣nor of knighthood.</P>
<P>BUT to return to the subject immediately under consideration.<NOTE PLACE="marg">DETECTED</NOTE> The plot of <HI>David</HI> against <HI>Glyndwr</HI> was discovered.

He was pardoned on a solemn promise of attachment to the cause of <HI>Glyndwr</HI> and his country. It appears, that our chieftain did not chuse to rely on his promise; but kept him in close confinement till the year 1412, as will appear in the transaction of that period.</P>
<P><PB N="337" REF="374"/>GLYNDWR, as usual, wreaked his vengeance on the lands and dependents of <HI>Dafydd Gam;</HI> entered his country, and burnt his house; and, while it was burning, calling one of <HI>David</HI>'s tenants, spoke thus merrily to him in verse; which shews the general turn of our people to the rhyming art:</P>
<Q><L>O gweli di wr coch Cam</L>

<L>Dywed ei bod hi tan y lan</L>

<P>PREPARATIONS were made with great vigor by all parties.<NOTE PLACE="marg">HOTSPUR MARCH∣ES TO SHREWSBU∣RY.</NOTE> <HI>Hotspur,</HI> leaving his father ill at <HI>Berwick,</HI> marched with his forces from the north; and, passing through <HI>Cheshire,</HI> a county ever affectionate to <HI>Richard,</HI> was joined there by a numerous party. <HI>Percy</HI> sent to <HI>Owen,</HI> to desire he would meet him; but our countryman declined to comply: howsoever, numbers of the <HI>Welsh</HI> joined <HI>Hotspur,</HI> and marched with him to <HI>Lichfield,</HI> carry∣ing the stag, the badge of the late king, as a party distinc∣tion. In that city he published his reasons for taking arms against <HI>Henry,</HI> whom the family had so lately placed on the throne<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Leland</HI> Collect. ii. 312.</NOTE>. From hence he led his army towards <HI>Shrewshury;</HI> probably because he found himself too weak to attack the usurper; for it seems as if his intention had been to have met him on his march, had <HI>Glyndwr</HI> joined him with his whole force. <HI>Glyndwr,</HI> on the other hand, had formed a considerable
<PB N="338" REF="375"/>
army in <HI>Wales;</HI> and Sir <HI>Edmund Mortimer</HI> had raised the vassals of his nephew.</P>
<P>IN the month of <HI>March, Henry</HI> gave a strong proof of the high opinion he had of his son <HI>Henry</HI> of <HI>Monmouth,</HI> afterwards king of <HI>England,</HI> at this time only fifteen years of age; for by writ, dated from <HI>Westminster</HI> the 7th of that month, he appoints him his lieutenant for <HI>Wales</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rymer, viii. 291.</NOTE> and all the adjacent counties, with full powers to raise men, and to act against the insurgents as he should think proper: to enquire into all treasons; to ex∣amine who supplied the rebels with arms or provisions; and to grant pardon to all who would lay down their arms, and give security for their peaceful behaviour.</P>
<P>HAVING thus provided, as he imagined, for the security of the borders of <HI>England</HI> on the side of <HI>Wales,</HI> he began to consi∣der of his march against the <HI>Percies.</HI> But hearing that <HI>Glyn∣dwr</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Idem, 304.</NOTE>, by reason of want of provisions, was preparing to make an inroad into the borders, issued orders from <HI>Westminster,</HI> dated <HI>June</HI> 12th, to the lieutenant of <HI>Gloucestershire</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Idem, 314.</NOTE>, to prepare to repel the invasion, with forces he should assemble for that purpose. <HI>Henry</HI> then made a most expeditious march to <HI>Burton</HI> upon <HI>Trent,</HI> where we find him on the 16th, on his way against the northern rebels<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Rymer.</NOTE>.<NOTE PLACE="marg">HENRY GOES TO MEET HIM.</NOTE> Here he understood that <HI>Percy,</HI> with his army, had advanced towards <HI>Shrewshury,</HI> and was preparing to effect a junction with the forces of <HI>Glyndwr</HI> and <HI>Mortimer.</HI> He well knew the importance of preventing it from taking place;

and directed his <HI>march</HI> towards that town, as is said, by the advice of the earl of <HI>Dunbar,</HI> a <HI>Scottish</HI> nobleman, who had espoused his cause. The dispatch with which the king executed this resolu∣tion, saved his crown. <HI>Glyndwr,</HI> who had assembled his forces at <HI>Oswestry,</HI> had sent off only his first division, amounting to four thousand men, who behaved with spirit in the day of ac∣tion<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Holinshed, 523.</NOTE>; in which fell his brother-in-law Sir <HI>Jenkin Hanmer</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Collins's Baronets, ii. 236. ed. 1720.</NOTE>. <HI>Henry</HI> prevented him from proceeding with the rest, by posting himself between <HI>Glyndwr</HI> and <HI>Shrewsbury,</HI> and at the critical time that the northern rebels were about to scale the walls. <HI>Percy</HI> quitted the attempt; and, after rejecting the offer of peace, attacked the royal army at <HI>Battlefield,</HI> three miles from the place.<NOTE PLACE="marg">PERCY DEFBATED AND SLAIN.</NOTE> He behaved with the spirit worthy of his name; fell valiantly, and with him the hopes of his party.

His great oversight appears to me to have been the neglect of attacking <HI>Henry</HI> immediately after the battle, when the royal forces had sustained a vast loss, and were overcome with fatigue; when his own followers, and the remains of the northern troops, would have formed an army nearly double to that of the king; when <HI>Northumberland,</HI> now recovered from his illness, was in full march towards him, the army of <HI>Mortimer</HI> entire, that of the king

He did propose to remedy the first, by seizing on the superfluous wealth of the prelates; but was prevented by the spirit of the archbishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> who boldly declared, that none of his province should be spoiled on any account; which frustrated <HI>Henry</HI>'s intent on <HI>Glyndwr.</HI> The prelate was afterwards better advised, and made a grant of the tenth towards the king's necessary charges<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Helinshed, 524.</NOTE></P>

<P>THE affairs of <HI>Glyndwr</HI> bore so prosperous an aspect, that about this time <HI>Trovor</HI> bishop of <HI>St. Asaph</HI> revolted from <HI>Henry,</HI> and joined with his countryman; whether actuated by remorse for his dealings with his old master, or tempted by the hopes of preferment under a new government, is not evident.</P>
<P>OWEN opened the campaign of this year with vigor. He laid waste the country of his enemies; took several castles,<NOTE PLACE="marg">GLYNDWR RE∣TEATS BEFORE THE ENGLISH:</NOTE> among others, those of <HI>Harlech</HI> and <HI>Aherystwyth.</HI> Some he dis∣mantled, and others he reserved, and garrisoned.

<P>THE <HI>English</HI> historians mention the defeat of <HI>Glyndwr.</HI> They inform us, that the <HI>English</HI> army was commanded by <HI>Richard Beauchamp</HI> earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI> who took the banner of <HI>Glyndwr</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Dugdale's Baron, i, 243.</NOTE>; but are silent in respect of the revenge that so immediately fol∣lowed. The king undertook nothing this year against <HI>Glyndwr. Beauchamp</HI> had large possessions in the county of <HI>Monmouth,</HI> and found it requisite to raise his vassals to preserve his country from desolation.</P>
<P><PB N="344" REF="381"/>1405.</P>
<P>THIS year opened with an attempt of a very extraordinary nature; nothing less than to free from their confinement the young earl of <HI>March</HI> and his brother,<NOTE PLACE="marg">ATTEMPTS TO STEAL AWAY THE EARE OF MARCH.</NOTE> with the intent of setting up the title of the first first that of <HI>Henry,</HI> and to involve the whole kingdom in his quarrel. There were many engaged in the design. <HI>Wales</HI> was to have been his asylum, and <HI>Glyndwr</HI> his pro∣tector: such deep intelligence had he with the dissaffected, even near the seat of the court. <HI>March</HI> was kept in close custody at <HI>Windsor,</HI> a royal residence, amidst guards, and secured by every precaution that a jealous usurper could invent. Notwithstanding, a plot was laid. <HI>Constance</HI> lady <HI>Spencer,</HI> widow to lord <HI>Spencer,</HI> and sister to the duke of <HI>York,</HI> contrived their deliverance. She procured false keys, stole away the two youths, and was has∣tening with them towards <HI>Wales,</HI> when they were seized and brought back. The lady was imprisoned. A severer fate at∣tended the poor smith that made the keys, who was beheaded, after having both his hands chopped off<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Holinshed, 527.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>FORTUNE now began to frown upon <HI>Glyndwr.</HI> The first experience he had of her mutability was on the 11th of <HI>March:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">BATTLE OF USKE;</NOTE> a body of his partizans, to the amount of eight thou∣sand, had assembled out of <HI>Glamorganshire, Uske, Netherwent,</HI> and <HI>Overwent.</HI> As usual, they began their march with desolat∣ing the country; and burnt part of the town of <HI>Grosmont,</HI> in the county of <HI>Monmouth. Henry</HI> prince of <HI>Wales</HI> was at that time at <HI>Heresord,</HI> with the army entrusted to him by his father,
<PB N="345" REF="382"/>
ready to open the campaign. He there received an account of the defeat of these malecontents, by a handful of men commanded by Sir <HI>Gilbert Talbot,</HI> joined by Sir <HI>William Newport</HI> and Sir <HI>John Greindre.</HI> He transmitted the account to his father, in a letter written in an uncommon strain of piety and dutifulness, contra∣dictory to the popular opinion of his early licentiousness; for at that time he was only seventeen years of age. He begins with imploring Heaven for its favor towards his father: <HI>Je supplie vraiement que</HI> DIEU <HI>vous montre graciousment pour vous son miracle on toutes parties, loez soit il en toutes ses ocures.—Il est bien voirs, que la victoire n'est pas en le multitude de people mes en la puissance de</HI> DIEU.</P>
<P>IT seems that the <HI>Welsh</HI> forgot the antient spirit of their coun∣try; and yielded an easy victory to the enemy. Eight hundred or a thousand were stain. No quarter was given on the occa∣sion, except to one person, <HI>un grant chiefteyn entre eulx.</HI> The humanity of young <HI>Henry</HI> appears to great advantage on this affair. He tells his father, that he would have sent the prisoner to him, but that he could not yet ride with any ease (I sup∣pose on account of his wounds) <HI>mes il ne poet chivacher uncore a son aise</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rymer, viii. 390.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>To repair this disaster, <HI>Glyndwr</HI> instantly sent one of his sons with another army. They probably were reinforced by the fugitives from the last action.<NOTE PLACE="marg">OF PWLL MELYN.</NOTE> Another battle was fought on the fifteenth of the same month, at <HI>Mynydd y Pwll Melyn</HI> in <HI>Brecknockshire,</HI> again fatal to the cause of <HI>Owen.</HI> Fifteen hun∣dred
<PB N="346" REF="383"/>
of his men were slain or taken prisoners: among the last was his son; among the first his brother <HI>Tudor,</HI> who resembled <HI>Glyndwr</HI> so greatly, that a report was spread of his death, to the great dejection of his countrymen: but, on examining the dead body, it was found to want a wart over the eye, which dis∣tinguished our chieftain from his brother. According to <HI>Carte</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">ii. 665.</NOTE>, young <HI>Henry</HI> commanded at this battle.</P>
<P>HOLINSHED<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">528.</NOTE> mentions another defeat which the <HI>Welsh</HI> sus∣tained in the month of <HI>May,</HI> in which <HI>Gryffydd Yonge, Owen'</HI>'s chancellor, was made prisoner. I suspect that the historian con∣founds this action with that near <HI>Grosmont;</HI> but that the chan∣cellor was the great chieftain there made prisoner, must be a mistake; for we find him witness, the next year, to a pardon granted by <HI>Owen</HI> to one <HI>Jeven Gôch.</HI></P>
<P>AFTER these defeats, all <HI>Glamorganshire</HI> submitted to the king, a few faithful friends only excepted; who, on discovering that <HI>Owen</HI> was alive, fled and joined him. It was at this time that he suffered those distresses which the <HI>English</HI> attribute to the latter part of his life. During this dispersion of his friends, he was obliged to seek protection from a few trusty partizans; and often to conceal himself in caves and desert places. A cavern near the sea-side, in the parish of <HI>Llangelynin,</HI> in the county of <HI>Merioneth,</HI> is still called <HI>Ogof Owain,</HI> in which he was secretly supported by <HI>Ednyfed ap Aaron,</HI> of the tribe of <HI>Ednowain ap Bradwen.</HI></P>
<P>THE bard <HI>Jolo Gôch</HI> deplores his absence; and calls him home from different parts of the globe, to re-possess himself of
<PB N="347" REF="384"/>
his principality. He in one place supposes him to be at <HI>Rome,</HI> and entreats him to return laden with tokens from St. <HI>Peter.</HI></P>
<P>ABOUT this time the earl of <HI>Northumberland</HI> began another conspiracy; which was detected, and several of his adherents were executed. Among others, one Sir <HI>John Griffith,</HI> a <HI>Welsh</HI> knight; which makes it probable, that the earl and <HI>Glyndwr</HI> still acted in concert. The king, by his activity, quickly frus∣trated this plot; seized on the earl's castles, and obliged him to fly into <HI>Scotland</HI> for protection. With him fled the bishops of St. <HI>Asaph</HI> and <HI>Bangor</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ferdun. Scotichronicon. ii, 441.</NOTE>, and the abbot of <HI>Welbeck.</HI> The two first were probably placed by <HI>Glyndwr</HI> about the earl, to consult the proper measures for the successful execution of their designs.</P>
<P>HENRY then returned,<NOTE PLACE="marg">HENRY MARCHRS AGAIN INTO WALES</NOTE> and marched into <HI>Wales</HI> with an army of 37,000 men. The same ill-fortune attended him in this as in former expeditions. The weather proved so bad, that he was obliged to make a hasty retreat to <HI>Worcester,</HI> aggravated with the loss of fifty of his carriages<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Walsingham, 566.</NOTE>. <HI>Shakespear</HI> makes our chieftain thus vaunt the frequent defeats of his antagonist, even before the battle of <HI>Shrewshury:</HI></P>

<P>OUR historians say, that they were commanded by the <HI>Mare∣chal de Montmorency;</HI> but I cannot discover that any of that great houss was engaged in the expedition.

of <HI>Ricux,</HI> seems to have been the acting general. According to the genius of the nation, the officers made the most bril∣liant appearance; and <HI>Hugueville</HI> actually sold to the church of <HI>Paris</HI> his fine estate of <HI>Agencourt</HI> near <HI>Mondidier,</HI> in order to furnish himself with a magnificent equipage<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Histoire et regne de <HI>Charles</HI> VI. tom. iv, 190.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE sleet had a very favorable passage; but, by neglect of pro∣viding sufficient quantity of fresh water, most of the horses pe∣rished.<NOTE PLACE="marg">LANDIN WALES.</NOTE> According to the best authority<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Rymer,</HI> viii. 406.</NOTE>, the forces landed, under the command of <HI>Hugueville,</HI> in <HI>Milsord Haven.</HI> He im∣mediately marched towards <HI>Caermarthen,</HI> which he besieged and look by capitulation.

<P>HE declined making any attempt on <HI>Pembroke,</HI> by reason of the strength of the castle; but sat down before <HI>Haversord-west:</HI> where the earl of <HI>Arundel</HI> made so gallant a defence, that the <HI>French</HI> were obliged to raise the siege with considerable loss. <HI>Glyndwr</HI> had, by this time, reached <HI>Tenbigh</HI> with ten thousand men, where he was joined by <HI>Hugueville.</HI> As soon as the neces∣sary preparations were finished, they marched through <HI>Glamor∣ganshire,</HI> reached <HI>Worcester,</HI> and burnt the suburbs, and ravaged the country round<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Monstrelet.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>As soon as <HI>Henry</HI> heard of the intended invasion, he issued out a proclamation<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Rymer, viii.</NOTE>, dated from <HI>Westminster, July</HI> 2d; in which he directs the lieutenants of several counties to raise forces to repel the foe. Lord <HI>Berkley,</HI> and <HI>Henry Pay</HI> admiral of the

<P>IN the beginning of <HI>August, Henry</HI> received advice that the <HI>French</HI> were landed; and again sends out a proclamation, dated from <HI>Pontesract, August</HI> 7th, addressed to the lieutenant of the county of <HI>Hereford,</HI> with orders to raise without delay his forces, and repair with them to the city of <HI>Hereford.</HI> It is in this proclamation he expressly calls the <HI>French</HI> general, lord of <HI>Hugue∣vilie.</HI></P>
<P>HENRY marched in person to oppose an enemy now grown so very formidable;<NOTE PLACE="marg">HENRY MARCHES AGAISST THEM</NOTE> but <HI>Hugueville,</HI> after plundering the country, on the king's approach, made a sudden retreat, and posted him∣self on a high hill, about three leagues from <HI>Worcester,</HI> with a deep valley between his and the royal army. Each endeavored to bring the enemy to make the attack; and for eight days they respectively presented themselves in order of battle, and so con∣tinued from morning till night; but neither party ventured to descend from its advantageous situation. During this time, there
<PB N="351" REF="388"/>
were several skirmishes. The loss on both sides was about two hundred, besides numbers wounded. The <HI>French</HI> lost <HI>Patrouil∣lart de Trie,</HI> lord of <HI>Mouci</HI> and <HI>Plessis,</HI> chamberlain to the king, and brother to the admiral; a gallant officer, whose fate was much lamented by the army *<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Moreri;</HI> who says he fell a the attack of Haversord-west</NOTE>.

<P>THE camp that <HI>Owen</HI> is supposed to have possessed, is on <HI>Wobury hill,</HI> in the parish of <HI>Whittley,</HI> exactly nine miles north-west of <HI>Worcester,</HI> It is surrounded with a single foss; and contains near twenty-seven acres.

I never had an opportunity of examining the na∣ture of the ground, and how far it suits the description given by <HI>Monstrelet;</HI> but the public will have their curiosity amply grati∣fied by the pen of my friend Dr. NASH, now employed in forming the history of his native county.</P>

<P>AFTER the defeat of <HI>Gryssydd</HI> son of <HI>Glyndwr,</HI> by <HI>Henry</HI> prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> that youthful warrior undertook the siege of <HI>Llan∣bedr</HI> castle, in the county of <HI>Cardigan.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">SIEGE OF LLAN∣BEDR CASTLE.</NOTE> After some time, the governor placed there by <HI>Glyndwr</HI> agreed to give it up, in case it was not relieved between the 24<SUP>th</SUP> of <HI>October</HI> and the feast of <HI>All Saints.</HI> He was to surrender it in good condition; not to injure the habitations in the town, nor seize any ships that should be

driven into the port by distress of weather: that he should have free pardon, and have liberty, at the end of the term, to depart with all his effects, and those of his friends.

<P>THE presence of that brave and active prince <HI>Henry</HI> of <HI>Mon∣mouth,</HI> who at the express request of parlement<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>Parliamentary Hist.</HI> ii. 93.</NOTE> resided in some part of <HI>Wales,</HI> was no small check on the enterprizing temper of <HI>Glyndwr,</HI> nor a less terror to the <HI>Welsh,</HI> who had felt the force of his arms. At the same time, parlement, sensible of the folly of the premature grants before made of the estates of the insurgents, entered on record, that no heritages conquered from the <HI>Welsh,</HI> be given away till one quarter of an year after<NOTE N="|" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>:

so precarious seemed the tenure, even in the declining state of our chiestain. I may remark, that he still had strength enough to give protection to the <HI>English</HI> fugitives. The great earl of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> and lord <HI>Bardels,</HI> found here a hospitable asy∣lum, after the <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ts,</HI> to whom they had entrusted themselves, meditated the giving of them up to <HI>Henry,</HI> in exchange for cer∣tain prisoners.

<P>BEFORE the expiration of this year, <HI>Henry</HI> made a grant in fee to Sir <HI>John Tibetot,</HI> speaker of the house of commons, and father to the accomplished peer <HI>John</HI> earl of <HI>Worcester,</HI> of the estates of <HI>Richard ap Gryffydd ap Vychan,</HI> in the counties of <HI>Caer∣marthen</HI> and <HI>Cardigan,</HI> forfeited by his adherence to the party of <HI>Glyndwr</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Parliamentary Hist,</HI> ii, 106.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>GLYNDWR again was not behind hand in acts of regal power;<NOTE PLACE="marg">GLYNDWR CRANTS A PAR∣DON.</NOTE> for about this he grants a pardon to one <HI>John ap H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d ap Jevan gôch; anno principatus nostri VI* datum apud Kevn Llan∣vair X die Jon per ipsum principem.</HI> On the seal was the portrait of <HI>Owen</HI> seated in a chair, holding a sceptre in his right hand, and a globe in the left.</P>
<P>IT is observable, that among the witnesses are <HI>Gryffydd</HI> his eldest son, and <HI>Gryffydd yonge</HI> his chancellor; both of whom, the <HI>English</HI> historians say, were made prisoners, and sent to the Tower. As <HI>Henry</HI> shewed no mercy to the partizans of <HI>Owen,</HI> it is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> probable that these two would have escaped his rage, had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>

ever been in his power. The other two witnesses are <HI>Meredith,</HI> another of his sons, and <HI>Rhys ap Tudur,</HI> and <HI>Gwillim ap</HI> ******.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING this ostentation of regal power,<NOTE PLACE="marg">HIS AFFAIRS DE∣CLINE.</NOTE> the affairs of <HI>Glyndwr</HI> evidently declined. The garrisons placed in most of the different fortresses of <HI>North Wales</HI> had kept the maritime parts from rising in any numbers in his favor. In the island of <HI>Auglesca,</HI> he seems to have had a very strong party. It does not appear that there ever was any battle in that island. It is my opi∣nion, that the partizans of <HI>Owen</HI> had passed the <HI>Menai,</HI> and, while their zeal was warm, had joined his army; and, like the custom in all feudal times, returned to their homes when wearied with the campaign, or satiated with plunder.</P>
<P>BY the latter end of this year, they had submitted to the royal authority: for I find, from a transcript of a manuscript found among the papers of the learned EDWARD LLWYD of the <HI>Mu∣saeum,</HI> this particular:</P>

<P>HISTORY furnishes us with very few materials respecting the transactions of this year. They were probably few and unim∣portant. <HI>Owen</HI> had lost the fortresses of <HI>Llanbedr</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Near <HI>Aberystwyth</HI> is an old embattled house, (as I am informed) called <HI>Ty Crys,</HI> reported to have been <HI>Glyndwr</HI>'s.</NOTE> (which was soon retaken) and that of <HI>Harlech.</HI> He was consined to the hills, and seems never to have quitted his fastnesses but to make a praedatory war.

<P>1408.</P>
<P>IN this year I discover nothing relative to the <HI>Welsh</HI> affairs, farther than a due compliment paid to the prince of <HI>Wales</HI> by the commons; who, by their speaker, desired the king to give public thanks to young <HI>Henry</HI> for his great fatigue and good conduct in <HI>Wales;</HI> for which both king and prince returned their compliments again to the commons<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Rymer,</HI> viii, 547.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>IN this year <HI>Glyndwr</HI> again began to make head.<NOTE PLACE="marg">MAKES HEAD A∣GAIN.</NOTE> By him∣self, or his partizans, he made great devastations on the marches, and in those parts of <HI>Wales</HI> that were well affected to the <HI>English</HI> government.

<P>THIS activity proved fatal to <HI>Rhys Ddu</HI> and <HI>Philip</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, two of <HI>Owen</HI>'s best officers, whom he had sent into <HI>Sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> where they committed great excesses. They were both made prisoners, sent to <HI>London,</HI> and executed. <HI>Caxton</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Cronycle of <HI>Englonde,</HI> 143.</NOTE> relates, that <HI>Rhys</HI> was taken before the justices, condemned, and drawn on a hurdle through the city to <HI>Tyburn,</HI> where he suffered the death of a traitor. His quarters were sent to four other cities; his head placed on <HI>London</HI> bridge.</P>
<P>ON the 18th of <HI>November,</HI> in this year, <HI>Henry</HI> issued out an order to the constable of <HI>Windsor</HI> castle, to deliver to Sir <HI>Wil∣liam Liste</HI> knight, marshal of <HI>England,</HI> the following <HI>Welsh</HI> pri∣soners:</P>

<P>AFTER this follows a warrant to Sir <HI>William</HI> to receive them. I imagine, that all these gentlemen were delivered to the marshal for execution; who, by his commission, seems to have been expressly appointed for that purpose; <HI>certis de causis ad ea omnia et singula quae ad officium</HI> Marescalli Angliae <HI>pertinent ex∣ercenda per litteras nostras patentes quam diu nobis placuerit, duraturas deputavimus.</HI></P>
<P>TOWARDS the latter end of the year, several of the officers of the lords marchers, either through dislike to the war, or for the sake of preserving their country from the fury of the <HI>Welsh,</HI> of their own authority formed a truce with <HI>Glyndwr</HI> and his partizans. This only served to enable them to make their in∣roads on other parts with more security. Many of the loyal borderers were slain, and others plundered, in consequence of these agreements. <HI>Henry</HI> was highly irritated, and immediately issued out writs<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Dated from <HI>Northampton,</HI> 23d <HI>November.</HI></NOTE> to <HI>Thomas</HI> earl of <HI>Arundel,</HI> Sir <HI>Richard L'E-strange</HI> lord of <HI>Knockyn, Ellesmere,</HI> and other borderirg manors, <HI>Edward Charlton</HI> lord <HI>Powys,</HI> and <HI>Reginald</HI> lord <HI>Grey</HI> of <HI>Ruthyn,</HI> and to the deputy-lieutenant of <HI>Heresordshire,</HI> directing them to
<PB N="362" REF="399"/>
cause all such illegal compacts to be rescinded, and <HI>Glyndwr</HI> and his adherents to be pursued, and attacked with the utmost vi∣gor.</P>
<P>FROM this period <HI>Owen</HI> never made any attempts worthy of historic notice. Numbers of his followers deserted; which obliged him to confine himself to the hills, and to act entirely on the defensive. Notwithstanding his power was reduced, he was far from being subdued. The years 1410 and 1411 were passed without any memorable actions. The <HI>English</HI> were con∣tent with the ease they enjoyed by restraining the outrages of the mountaneers.<HI>Glyndwr</HI> maintained that extensive tract that forms the <HI>Alps</HI> of our country, and kept his prisoners so securely consined, that even <HI>Henry,</HI> in 1412, was under the necessity of permitting (by writ<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dated <HI>July</HI> 14th. <HI>Rymer,</HI> viii. 753.</NOTE>) his esquire <HI>Llewelyn ap Hoel,</HI> father to the noted <HI>David Gam,</HI> to make use of Sir <HI>John Tiptoste</HI> and <HI>William Botiller,</HI> to treat with <HI>Owen</HI> about the redemption of his son, who was kept <HI>forti et durâ prisonâ,</HI> or to endeavour to seize fome of <HI>Glyndwr</HI>'s friends to exchange for <HI>Gam.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">TREATY.</NOTE> What the result of this affair was, does not appear. It serves, though, to disprove the opinion, that <HI>David</HI> escaped to <HI>England</HI> after his infamous at∣tempt in 1402; for which, as is now evident, he suffered a most fevere, but merited captivity of ten years, from which all the power of his <HI>English</HI> friends could not release him.</P>
<P>THE prison where <HI>Owen</HI> confined his captives was not far from his house,<NOTE PLACE="marg">THE PRISON OF GLYNDWR.</NOTE> in the parish of <HI>Llansanfraid Glyndwrdwy;</HI> and the place is to this day called <HI>Carchardy Owen Glyndwrdwy.</HI> Some
<PB N="363" REF="400"/>
remains are still to be seen near the church, which form part of a habitable house. It consists of a room thirteen feet square, and ten and a half high. The sides consist of three horizontal beams, with upright planks, not four inches asunder, mortised into them. In these are grooves with holes in the bottom, as if there had been originally cross-bars, or grates. The roof is exceedingly strong, composed of strong planks almost conti∣guous. It seems as if there had been two stories; but the up∣per part at present is evidently modern.</P>
<P>IT is singular, that the government did not take advantage of two <HI>Welshmen</HI> of rank, whom they had this year in their power, and whom they might have made the price of the liberty of their partizan. These were <HI>Rhys ap Tudur</HI> of <HI>Penmynydd</HI> in <HI>Angle∣sea,</HI> and his brother. Perhaps they were taken after the treaty had its effect; perhaps their crimes were too enormous for par∣don: but whatsoever the case was, they were both conveyed to <HI>Chester,</HI> and there put to death.</P>
<P>I MUST not omit, that in 1410, <HI>Henry</HI> prince of <HI>Wales</HI> gave a free pardon to certain of his tenants in the comot of <HI>Coleshill,</HI> in the county of <HI>Flint</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Harleian</HI> MSS. N<SUP>o</SUP> 1999. 32.</NOTE>, for the share they had in what was styled the rebellion of <HI>Glyndwr.</HI> That county was much divided in those troubles. <HI>Howel Gwynedd,</HI> descended from <HI>Edwin</HI> lord of <HI>Tegengle,</HI> a valiant gentleman, who sided with our chieftain, was in one of tire preceding years surprised by his enemies from the town of <HI>Flint.</HI> He probably was posted within the trenches
<PB N="364" REF="401"/>
of <HI>Moel y Gaer,</HI> in the parish of <HI>Northop;</HI> on which he was without process, beheaded.</P>
<P>1413.</P>
<P>HENRY died in the beginning of this year;<NOTE PLACE="marg">HENEY DIES.</NOTE> and left his youth∣ful successor so engaged in his preparations for the conquest of <HI>France,</HI> as to lose ail thoughts of the entire subjection of his <HI>British</HI> dominions. <HI>Glyndwr</HI> remained still inaccessible; but was so closely guarded, as to cease to be tremendous. The <HI>W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sh</HI> who had submitted, now began to indulge their revenge against such of the <HI>English</HI> who had slain, or otherwise injured any of their relations or friends in the late war. This revenge was taken by various kinds of distress and imprisonment, till they had cleared themselves by compurgation, or made some satis∣factory agreement. To remedy this, <HI>Henry</HI> the Vth, in his first year, abolishes<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Statutes at Large, <HI>Ruffhead</HI>'s; ed. i. 484. <HI>Par un</HI> ASSACH <HI>solonc la cus∣tome de</HI> GALES <HI>dest à dire par la serement de CCC bommes.</HI> See also <HI>Leges Wallicae,</HI> 188. <HI>&amp; seq.</HI></NOTE> the <HI>Assach,</HI> or oath of 300 men, necessary, ac∣cording to the custom of <HI>Wales,</HI> to clear a person accused of any crime.<NOTE PLACE="marg">ASSACH.</NOTE> Before that, an <HI>Englishman</HI> was liable to continue in jail for life, as it seems impossible for one of that hated nation to procure even a far less number of compurgators than this strange law required for his acquittal. <HI>Henry</HI> made the attempt penal, and the prosecutor liable to an imprisonment of two years, to pay treble damages, and to pay beside, a fine and ransom before he could be released.</P>
<P><PB N="365" REF="402"/>THIS was the last of the many laws enacted against the <HI>Welsh</HI> on occasion of this insurrection.<NOTE PLACE="marg">SEVERE LAWS.</NOTE> They were certainly very se∣vere; yet, perhaps, no more than what any government would have directed, against a people that had submitted to conquest near a hundred and twenty years, and who were considered in no other light than that of rebellious subjects.</P>
<P>ON the first insurrection, conciliatory methods were tried, and pardons offered. After experience of the little effect these had on the minds of the <HI>Welsh,</HI> every lenient step was laid aside, and laws of a very severe nature were put in force against them.</P>
<P>THE first was in the year 1400. It was found expedient to prevent, as much as possible, all intercourse between the <HI>Welsh</HI> and <HI>English.</HI> The first were strongly attached to the cause of <HI>Richard;</HI> the last had many secret favorers of that unhappy prince among them. There appeared much danger, if the for∣mer were permitted to strengthen their interest in <HI>England:</HI> a coalition fatal to the new government was apprehended. As a preventative, it was enacted: That no person born on both sides of <HI>Welsh</HI> parents should purchase lands or tenements near any of the cities or towns on the marches of <HI>Wales,</HI> on pain of forfeit∣ing them to the lord paramount where such estates lay: That no <HI>Welshman</HI> should be received into any corporation town; or, if they had been settled in any such before, they were to find security for their good and loyal behaviour; they were to be totally disquali∣fied from any civil office, and never allowed to carry any weapons.</P>
<P>IN case any <HI>Welshman</HI> refused to restore to any <HI>Englishman</HI> the cattle, horses, or the like, (which he had forcibly taken) within seven days, the <HI>Englishman</HI> was allowed to retaliate.</P>
<P><PB N="366" REF="403"/>So little trust was there in justice from our countrymen, that it was enacted, that no <HI>Englishman</HI> should be condemned at the suit of a
<HI>Welshman,</HI> unless by <HI>English</HI> justices, or <HI>English</HI> bur∣gesses.</P>
<P>So greatly did the government apprehend the seduction of <HI>English</HI> loyalty by the charms of our countrywomen, that the <HI>Eng∣lish</HI> were prohibited from marrying with a <HI>Welshwoman,</HI> under the pain of being disqualified from holding any office in <HI>Wales.</HI></P>
<P>IN 1402, there is a very particular statute, intended to remedy the mischiefs resulting from some customs peculiar to <HI>Wales.</HI> This directs,<NOTE PLACE="marg">KYMHORTHA.</NOTE> that <HI>nul westour, rymour, minstrall, ne vagabond, soit aucunement sustenuz en la terre de</HI> Gales, <HI>par faire kymorthas ou coillage sur le commune poeple illoeqes.</HI> I cannot give a better trans∣lation, than that in the observations on the antient statutes, by my esteemed friend the honorable DAINES BARRINGTON; which is to this purpose: THAT no host<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I beg leave to render the word <HI>westour</HI> differently: it seems derived from the <HI>Welsh, gwestwr,</HI> which signifies a person who kept a place of public entertainment; and such a place was very proper for a rendezvous of this nature.</NOTE>, rhymer, minstrel, or other vagabond, should presume to assemble or collect together.</P>
<P>THE word <HI>kymhortha</HI> is mis-spelt from the <HI>Welsh cymmorth,</HI> or the plural <HI>cymmorthau,</HI> assemblies of people to assist a neigh∣bor in any work. Such are very frequently in use at present. There are <HI>cymmorthan</HI> for spinning; for works of husbandry; for coal-carriage. But at this time, these meetings were mere pretences; and their end was the collecting a sufficient number
<PB N="367" REF="404"/>
of able-bodied men to make an insurrection. Of such a nature, in old times, were the hunting-matches in <HI>Scotland.</HI> The legisla∣ture in that part of <HI>Great Britain</HI> found the evils resulting from them, and at length suppressed them by a law.</P>
<P>BUT <HI>cymhorthau</HI> of our countrymen were at this period of a most tremendous nature. They were composed of men the most dreaded by tyrants and usurpers; of BARDS, who animated our nation, by recalling to mind the great exploits of our an∣cestors, their struggles for liberty, their successful contests with the <HI>Saxon</HI> and <HI>Norman</HI> race for upwards of eight centuries. They rehearsed the cruelty of their antagonists, and did not forget the savage policy of the first <HI>Edward</HI> to their proscribed bre∣thren. They brought before their countrymen the remembrance of antient prophecies. They shewed to them the hero <HI>Glyndwr,</HI> descended from the antient race of our princes; and pronounced, that in him was to be expected the completion of every predic∣tion of our oracular MERLIN. The band of minstrels now struck up; the harp, the <HI>crwth,</HI> and the pipe, filled the mea∣sure of enthusiasm which the others had begun to inspire. They rushed to battle, fearless of events, like their great ancestry, moved by the <HI>Druids</HI> songs; and scorned death, which conferred immortality in reward of their valor,

<P>WE find that <HI>Glyndwr</HI> maintained his situation for two year; longer.

This does not wear the face of probability; for, had his situation been so deplorable, majesty would never have condescended to propose terms to such a scourge as <HI>Glyndwr</HI> had been to his kingdom. This retreat, and the distresses he underwent, were probably after the battle of <HI>Pwll Melyn</HI> in 1405, from which he quickly emer∣ged. Death alone deprived <HI>Owen</HI> of the glory of accepting an offered accommodation. The treaty was renewed by the same minister, on the 24th of <HI>February</HI> 1416, with <HI>Meredydd ap Owen,</HI> the son of <HI>Glyndwr;</HI> which it is to be supposed took effect, and peace was restored to <HI>England,</HI> after an indecisive strug∣gle of more than fifteen years.

<P>THERE still remain the ruins of the church,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHURCH.</NOTE> and part of the abby: the last inhabited by a farmer. The church was built in form of a cross, in different styles of architecture. The most antient is that of the east end, where the windows are in form of long and narrow slips, pointed at top. The window at the west end is large, divided by stone tracery; and above is a round window of elegant work. Above it is an inscription in memory of the person who repaired or re-built this part: an honor frequently paid to benefactors of this kind. It is in this form; ĀD. ADAM. DMS. <HI>Fecit Hoc opus.

<P>THE capitals of the pilasters within the church, are finished with elegant foliage. In the north transept, is a cloister of two arches; an arch that once contained a tomb; and near it a double <HI>benetoire,</HI> or holy-water pot.</P>
<P>MUCH of the building is made of the coarse slaty stone of the country. The door and window frames of fine free∣stone.</P>
<P>THE abbot's apartment was contiguous to the church. There opens from it a small space, where he might stand to hear the holy offices performed below.</P>
<P>THE lower part of the abby is vaulted, and supported by rows of low pillars; now divided into different rooms. In front is a large window with curious stone tracery, which reaches to the ground.

<P><PB N="373" REF="413"/>ABOUT a quarter of a mile higher up the vale,<NOTE PLACE="marg">PILLAR OF EAISEQ</NOTE> in the hedge of a meadow, I met with the remainder of a round column, perhaps one of the most antient of any <HI>British</HI> inscribed pillar now existing.</P>
<P>IT was entire till the civil wars of the last century, when it was thrown down and broken by some ignorant fanatics; who thought it had too much the appearance of a cross, to be suf∣fered to stand. It probably bore the name of one; for the field it lies in is still called <HI>Llwyn-y-Groes,</HI> or the Grove of the Cross, from the wood that surrounded it. It was erected at so early a period, that there is nothing marvellous, if we should perceive a tincture of the old idolatry, or at left of the primeval customs of our country, in the mode of it when per∣fect.</P>
<P>THE pillar never had been a cross; notwithstanding folly and superstition might, in later times, imagine it to have been one and have paid it the usual honors. It was a memorial of the dead; an improvement on the rude columns of <HI>Druidical</HI> times and cut into form, and surrounded with inscription. It is among the first lettered stones that succeeded the <HI>Meini-hirion, Meini∣Gwŷr,</HI> and <HI>Llcchau.</HI> It stood on a great <HI>tumulus;</HI> perhaps always environed with wood (as the mount is at present) according to the custom of the most antient times, when standing. pillars were placed under <HI>every green tree</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Kings, ii. 17. See the learned <HI>Rowlands,</HI> 52.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>It is said that the stone, when complete, was twelve feet high. It is now reduced to six feet eight. The remainder of the

capital is eighteen inches long. It stood infixed in a square pe∣destal, still lying in the mount; the breadth of which is five feet three inches: the thickness eighteen inches.</P>
<P>THE beginning of the inscription gives us nearly the time of its erection: <Q><HI>Concenn</HI> filius <HI>Cateli, Catteli</HI> filius <HI>Broch∣mail, Broch∣mail</HI> filius <HI>Eliseg, Eliseg</HI> filius <HI>Cnoillaine, Concenn</HI> itaque prone∣pos <HI>Eliseg</HI> edificavit hunc lapidem proavo suo <HI>Eliseg.</HI></Q></P>
<P>THIS <HI>Concenn,</HI> or <HI>Congen,</HI> was the grandson of <HI>Brochmail Ys∣cithroc,</HI> the same who was defeated in 607 at the battle of <HI>Chester</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">BEDE Hist. lib. ii. c. 2. p. 80.</NOTE>. The letters on the stone were copied by Mr. <HI>Edward Llwyd:</HI> the inscription is now illegible; but, from the copy taken by that great antiquary, the alphabet nearly resembles one of those in use in the sixth century<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Vide Doctor MORTON'S Table of Alphabeth.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>ONE of the seats of <HI>Concenn</HI> and <HI>Eliseg</HI> was in this country. A township adjacent to the column bears, from the last, the name of <HI>Eglwyseg;</HI> and the picturesque tiers of rocks are called <HI>Gliseg</HI> for the same reason. The habitation of this prince of <HI>Powys</HI> in these parts was probably <HI>Dinas Brân,</HI> which lies at the head of the vale of <HI>Gliseg.</HI> Mr. <HI>Llwyd</HI> conjectures, that this place took its name from the interment of <HI>Eliseg;</HI> by a similar in∣stance in the county of <HI>Caermarthen;</HI> where the place in which a monumental stone stands, is called <HI>Pant y Polion,</HI> corruptly for <HI>Pant Pawlin,</HI> from <HI>Paulinus,</HI> the person it was inscribed to:</P>

<P><PB N="375" REF="417"/>THERE are two ways from this pillar: the usual is along the vale, on an excellent turnpike-road leading to <HI>Ruthyn;</HI> the other is adapted only for the travel of the horsemen; but far the more preferable, on account of the romantic views. I returned by <HI>Valle Crucis;</HI> and, after winding along a steep midway to the old castle, descended, and after crossing the rill of the <HI>Brán,</HI> ar∣rived in the valley of <HI>Glisseg;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">VALLEY OF GLISSEG.</NOTE> long and narrow, bounded on the right by the asbonishing precipices, divided into numberless paral∣lel strata of white limestone, often giving birth to vast yew-trees: and on the left, by smooth and verdant hills, bordered by pretty woods. One of the principal of the <HI>Glisseg</HI> rocks is honored with the name of <HI>Craig-Arthur.</HI> That at the end of the vale is called <HI>Craig y Forwyn,</HI> or the maiden's; is bold, precipitous, and termi∣nates with a vast natural column.</P>
<P>THIS valley is chiefly inhabited (happily) by an independent race of warm and wealthy yeomanry, undevoured as yet by the great men of the country.</P>
<P>IN order to get into the great road, I pursued a path up a steep ascent to the left; and about mid-way visited a house noted for being the residence of one <HI>Edward Davies,</HI> a low partizan. and plunderer on the side of the usurper during the civil wars. He was best known in his own country by the title of <HI>Cneifiwr Glâs,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">CNEIPIWR GLAS.</NOTE> or the <HI>Blue Shaver,</HI> from his rapacity, and the color of his cloaths; and was considered as a fit instrument of the tyranny of the times. In 1654, he was appointed, by the commissioners for sequestration, steward of the court-leet within the manor of <HI>Valle Crucis,</HI> being recommended to the office by colonel <HI>George Twisleton,</HI> The <HI>Cneifiwr</HI> seems to have not been over-true to his

own party, when his interest stood in the way. He was accus∣tomed to take even the royalists under his protection, on receiving a proper reward. He once concealed Sir <HI>Evan Llwyd</HI> of <HI>Bodi∣dris,</HI> at the time that a considerable sum was ordered for his apprehension. He lodged him in a cellar below the parlor; then summoning his people, ordered them, in a seeming rage, to sally out in quest of Sir <HI>Evan,</HI> stamping with his foot, and declaring, that if the knight was <HI>above ground,</HI> he would have him.</P>
<P>AFTER continuing an ascent for a little space longer, reach the pass called <HI>Bwlch y Rhiw Velen,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">BWLCH Y RHIW VELEN.</NOTE> and fall again into the great road. This place is distinguished by the deaths of two of the sons of <HI>Llowarch Hên,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">LLOWARCH HEN.</NOTE> the <HI>Cumbrian</HI> prince of the sixth century; who were slain in battle, and whose loss the princely bard, their father, deplores in an elegy, of which these lines are a fragment:</P>

<P>LLOWARCH HEN left his country to expel the <HI>Saxons</HI> and <HI>Irish</HI> out of this part of <HI>Britain.</HI> He leaves us ignorant of the event: all he acquaints us with is, that he lost twelve sons in the gene∣rous attempt.</P>
<P><PB N="377" REF="419"/>FROM the height above <HI>Rhiw Velen,</HI> is a very extensive pro∣spect of the hundred of <HI>Yale;</HI> hilly, fertile in grass, abundant in cattle; but in this part dreary, and destitute of hedges and woods: banks, for the most part, supply the place of the first; and brakes of the latter. After some descent, cross the <HI>Alyn,</HI> Here a trifling rill (which, after running for some time, receives much increase) waters the rich vales of <HI>Mold</HI> and <HI>Hope;</HI> and passes between the picturesque banks from near <HI>Caergwrle</HI> to <HI>Gresford,</HI> where it goes through an extensive flat, and falls into the <HI>Dee</HI> midway between <HI>Holt</HI> and <HI>Eaton</HI> Boat. Leave, a little to the left, a place called <HI>Havod yr Abad,</HI> the site of one of the country-seats of the abbot of <HI>Valle Crucis.</HI> Close to the road∣side lies <HI>Tommen y Rhodwydd,</HI> once a fortress known by the name of the castle of <HI>Yale</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Powel,</HI> 201.</NOTE>, built by <HI>Owen Gwynedd,</HI> about the year 1148<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Powel,</HI> 201.</NOTE>. This is the place <HI>Leland,</HI> mistakenly, calls a castle belonging to <HI>Owen Glyndwr</HI> ‡. It consists of a vast artificial mount, with another still loftier near one end, the keep of the place. These are surrounded with a great foss and rampart; and have only a single entrance. At present, there are not the lest reliques of the superstructure: which was probably of wood; for we are told, that this short-lived castelet was burnt nine years after its erection, by <HI>Jorwerth Goch ap Meredydd</HI><NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot"><HI>Powel,</HI> 208.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IT is in this manner we must account for the total disappear∣ance of many <HI>Welsh</HI> castles, whose names are preserved in history;<NOTE PLACE="marg">WOODEN CASTLES.</NOTE> and whose vestiges we have sought for in vain. They were made of wood, as was very customary with several antient na∣tions,
<PB N="378" REF="420"/>
and with others of later date. The <HI>Persians,</HI> on the ap∣proach of the <HI>Spartans,</HI> secured themselves within their wooden walls: and <HI>Cesar</HI> found great resistance from a tower in the <HI>Al∣pine</HI> castle of <HI>Larignum,</HI> made of the timber of the <HI>Larix,</HI> or the <HI>Larch,</HI> which was found to be incombustible<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vitruvsius, <HI>lib.</HI> ii. c. 9. p. 35.</NOTE>. In later times, the castle of <HI>Bamborough</HI> was built originally by <HI>Ida</HI> with wood; the burgh of <HI>Murray</HI> was fortified by the <HI>Danes</HI> with the same material. The people of the same county, in 1228, had castles of wood<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Annals Scotland, 149.</NOTE> and, a century after these, more recent instances: <HI>William de Melton,</HI> archbishop of <HI>York</HI> in 1317, fortified the mount in that city, called the <HI>Old Bale,</HI> with planks eighteen inches thick.</P>
<P>WHENSOEVER we find an antient fortress totally vanished, and we cannot account for the disposal of the materials in the erecting of any neighboring buildings, we must suppose that they had been constructed of wood; and that they had been destroyed by fire, either flung into them by means of torches, or by <HI>veltae,</HI> or vast masses of combustibles rolled against them by the force of numbers, as was the practice of the antient <HI>Scandi∣navians,</HI> described by <HI>Olaus Magnus.</HI></P>
<P>FROM <HI>Tommen y Rhodwydd</HI> I crossed the country for about two miles to the village of <HI>Llandegla,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">LLANDEGLA.</NOTE> noted for its vast fairs for black cattle. The church is dedicated to St. <HI>Tecla,</HI> virgin and martyr; who, after her conversion by St. <HI>Paul,</HI> suffered under <HI>Nero</HI> at <HI>Iconium.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="379" REF="421"/>ABOUT two hundred yards from the church, in a quillet called <HI>Gwern Degla,</HI> rises a small spring, with these letters cut on free-stone: A.

These ceremonies are never begun till after sun-set, in order to inspire the votaries with greater awe. If the afflicted be of the male-sex, like <HI>Socrates,</HI> he makes an of∣fering of a cock to his <HI>Aesculapius,</HI> or rather to <HI>Tecla Hygeia;</HI> if of the fair-sex, a hen. The fowl is carried in a basket, first round the well; after that into the church-yard; when the same orisons, and the same circum-ambulations are performed round the church. The votary then enters the church; gets under the communion-table; lies down with the Bible under his or her head; is covered with the carpet or cloth, and rests there till break of day; departing after offering six pence, and leaving the fowl in the church. If the bird dies, the cure is supposed to have been effected, and the disease transferred to the devoted victim.</P>
<P>FROM hence I visited the house of <HI>Bodidris,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">BODIDRIS.</NOTE> a large and antient place, belonging to <HI>Evan Lloyd Vaughan</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> of <HI>Corsygedol,</HI> in right of his mother <HI>Margaret,</HI> daughter of Sir <HI>Evan Lloyd</HI> ba∣ronet, the last male of the family: descended from <HI>ynyr ap Howel ap Moriddig ap Sandde Hardd;</HI> who, by his valor at the battle of <HI>Corwen;</HI> in 1165, obtained from his prince the honorable dis∣tinction in his arms of four bloody strokes, or, in the heralds

The prince observing this, ordered him to carry them on his shield; and at the same time bestowed on him the township of <HI>Gelligynan</HI> in this neighbor∣hood, as a more substantial mark of his favor.</P>
<P>BODIDRIS takes its name from <HI>Idris,</HI> son of <HI>Llewelyn</HI> AUR∣DORCHOG, <HI>or of the goden torques,</HI> the antient lord of <HI>Yale.</HI> It stands in two counties, <HI>Flintshire</HI> and <HI>Denbighshire;</HI> the long table in the hall having an end in each.</P>
<P>FROM hence I continued my journey to <HI>Llanarmon,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">LLAMARMON</NOTE> a village whose church is dedicated to St. <HI>Germanus</HI> bishop of <HI>Auxerre;</HI> who, with St. <HI>Lupus,</HI> contributed to gain the famous <HI>Victoria Alleluiatica</HI> over the Picts and <HI>Saxons</HI> near <HI>Mold.</HI> He was a most popular patron, and has numbers of other churches in <HI>Wales</HI> un∣der his protection. An image of an ecclesiastic, still to be seen in the church-wall, is called his.

<P>IN the church is the tomb of a grandson of the bloody-fingered warrior above mentioned, carrying on his shield the arms won by his ancestor, inscribed around, <HI>Hic jacet Grusudd ap Lhewelyn ap Ynyr.</HI> At his feet lies a dog gnawing a heap of intestines. The tradition of the country is, that he engaged in
<PB N="381" REF="423"/>
a <HI>crusade,</HI> in which he lost his life by a wound in the abdomen; that his bowels fell out, and were seized by a dog, as expressed by the sculptor. If he fell in the romantic cause of the holy sepulchre, the artist must have forgot to have placed him cross-legged, the monumental distinction of all such knights-errant. The tomb is a chest cut out of one stone, in which his body was put, and sent home. The lid is another stone, with his effigies carved out of it.</P>
<P>SEPULCHARAL <HI>tumuli</HI> are very frequent in this parish.<NOTE PLACE="marg">TUMILI.</NOTE> I was present at the opening of one, composed of loose stones and earth, covered with a layer of soil about two feet thick, and over that a coat of verdant turf. In the course of our search, were discovered, towards the middle of the tumulus, several urns made of sun-burnt clay, of a reddish color on the outside, black within, being stained with the ashes they contained. Each was placed with the mouth downwards on a flat stone; above each was another, to preserve them from being broken by the weight above. Mixed with the loose stones, were numerous fragments of bones; such as parts of the thigh-bones, the arm-bones, and even a scull. These had escaped the effects of the fire of the funeral pile, and were deposited about the urns; which con∣tained the residuum of the corpse, that had been reduced to pure ashes.</P>
<P>I SHALL mention in the following pages the high antiquity of this custom; that it was in use with the most polished nations, with the <HI>Greeks</HI> and with the <HI>Romans,</HI> as well as with the most barbarous. The antient <HI>Germans</HI> practised this rite, as appears

<P>THE second was styled <HI>Hoigold,</HI> and <HI>Hoielse-tiide,</HI> or the age of <HI>tumuli,</HI> or hillocks. The corpse at this period was placed entire, with all the ornaments which graced it during life. The bracelets, or arms, and even the horse of the departed hero, were placed beneath the heap. Money, and all the rich property of the deceased, used to be buried with him, from the persuasion that the soul was immortal<NOTE N="|" PLACE="foot">Pomponius Mela, <HI>lib.</HI> iii. c. 2.</NOTE> and would stand in need of these things in the other life. Such was the notion both of the <HI>Gauls</HI> and of the northern nations. Among the last, when py∣racy was esteemed honorable, these illustrious robbers directed that all their rich plunder should be deposited with their re∣mains<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Bartholinus <HI>Antiq.</HI> Dan. 438.</NOTE>, in order to stimulate their offspring to support them∣selves, and the glory of their name, by deeds of arms. Hence it is we hear of the vast riches discovered in sepulchres, and of
<PB N="383" REF="425"/>
the frequent violation of the remains of the dead, in expecta∣tion of treasures, even for centuries after this custom had ceased.</P>
<P>THE third age was called <HI>Christendoms-old,</HI> when the introduc∣tion of Christianity put a stop to the former customs: for 'Christians,' as the learned physician of <HI>Norwich</HI> observes, <Q>ab∣horred this species of obsequies; and though they stickt not to give their bodies to be burnt in their lives, detested that mode after death; affecting rather depositure than absumption, and properly submitted unto the sentence of GOD, to return not unto ashes, but to dust again.</Q></P>
<P>FROM the remarks of these able writers, we may learn the time of the abolition of the custom of burning among the se∣veral nations; for it ceased with paganism. It therefore fell first into disuse with the <HI>Britons;</HI> for it was for some time retained by the <HI>Saxons</HI> after their conquest of this king∣dom; but was left off on their receiving the light of the go∣spel. The <HI>Danes</HI> retained the custom of urn-burial the last of any: for of all the northern nations who had any footing in these kingdoms, they were the latest who embraced the doc∣trines of Christianity.</P>
<P>I CANNOT establish any criterion by which a judgment may be made of the people to whom the different species of urns and tumuli belonged, whether they are <HI>British, Roman, Saxon,</HI> or <HI>Danish.</HI></P>
<P>SOME of the tumuli consist of heaps of naked stones, such as those in the isle of <HI>Arran;</HI> in many parts of <HI>Scotland;</HI> and in some parts of <HI>Cornwall.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="384" REF="426"/>OTHERS are composed, like this of <HI>Llanarmon,</HI> with stones and earth, nicely covered with earth and sod. Of these the base is in certain places level with the ground, in others, surrounded with a trench: they were sometimes formed of earth only. Others are of a conoid form, and some oblong; of which there is an example in the neighborhood of <HI>Bryn y pys,</HI> called the <HI>Giant's Grave.</HI> Finally, other places of antient sepulture con∣sisted only of a flat area, encompassed, like the <HI>Druidical</HI> circles, with upright stones; and such were those of <HI>Ubbo,</HI> and of king <HI>Harald,</HI> in <HI>Sweden</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Suecia</HI> Antiqua et Hodierna, <HI>tab,</HI> 315.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE urns are also found placed in different manners, with the mouth resting downwards upon a flat stone, secured by an∣other above; or with the mouth upwards, guarded in a like way.</P>
<P>VERY frequently the urns are discovered lodged in a square cell composed of flags. Sometimes more than one of these cells are found beneath a <HI>carn</HI> or <HI>tumulus.</HI> I have even met with, near <HI>Dupplin</HI> in <HI>Perthshire,</HI> not fewer than seventeen, disposed in a circular form<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Tour in <HI>Scotland,</HI> iii-106.</NOTE>. When numbers are found together, the tu∣mulus was either a family-cemetery, or might have contained the reliques of a number of heroes who perished with glory in the same cause: for such honors were paid only to the great and good.</P>
<P>THE urns found in these cells are usually surrounded with the fragments of bones that had resisted the fire; for the friends of the deceased were particularly careful to collect every particle;
<PB N="385" REF="427"/>
which they placed, with the remains of the charcoal, about the urns, thinking the neglect the utmost impiety, We have no certainty of the ceremonies used by the antient <HI>Britons</HI> on these mournful occasions; but, from many circumstances which we continually discover in our tumuli, there appear many, analo∣gous to those used in antient <HI>Greece</HI> and <HI>Rome.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>Greeks</HI> first quenched the funeral pile with wine, and the companions or relations of the departed performed the rest. Such was the ceremony at the funeral of <HI>Patroclus.</HI></P>

<P>I BEG leave to add the account given by <HI>Virgil</HI> of the funereal rites of <HI>Pallas</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Lib. xi. I. 184.</NOTE>. We find in it many ceremonies that were used by the northern nations. Animals of different species were burnt or deposited with the body. The spoils of war, and weapons of various kinds, were placed on the pile; the bones and ashes were collected together; and a heap of earth, or a <HI>tumulus,</HI> flung over them. Each of these circumstances are continually disco∣vered in our barrows. Horns, and other reliques of quadrupeds, weapons of brass and of stone, all placed under the very same sort of tombs as are described by <HI>Homer</HI> and <HI>Virgil.</HI> Perhaps
<PB N="387" REF="429"/>
the other ceremonies were not omitted; but we have no record that will warrant us to assert that they were in all respects simi∣lar.</P>

<P>SINCE I am engaged in this funebrious subject, it will be fit to observe, that a discovery of an entire skeleton, placed between flags of a proportionable size, was made near this place. This,
<PB N="388" REF="430"/>
as well as others similar in different parts of our islands, evinces that the antient inhabitants did not always commit their bodies to the fire: for, besides this instance, a skeleton thus inclosed was found in one of the <HI>Orknies</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Letter from the Rev. Mr. <HI>Low</HI> of <HI>Birsa</HI></NOTE>, and others in the shire of <HI>Murray;</HI> and with one of the last was found an urn with ashes, and several pieces of charcoal<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Tour <HI>Scotl.</HI> 1769, q<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arto ed.</NOTE> which-shews, that each practice was in use in the same age.</P>
<P>FROM <HI>Llanarmon</HI> I continued my journey along the bad roads of that parish. The country now grows more contracted, by the approximation of the hills. On one side are the rocky ledges of limestone, in the township of <HI>Tre'r Yrys,</HI> rich in lead-ore; and which is supposed to have taken its name from <HI>Gyrys,</HI> who made the first collection of <HI>Welsh</HI> proverbs, known by the name of <HI>Mad-waith bén Gyrys o Jal,</HI> or the good work of old Gyrys of <HI>Yale.</HI></P>
<P>ON the left are the <HI>Clwydian</HI> hills, which divide this country from the vale of <HI>Clwyd.</HI> These are cultivated pretty high; are free from rocks, covered with heath.</P>
<P>THERE is a <HI>Bwlch,</HI> or pass through these hills, of a most re∣markable name, lying between the summits called <HI>Moel Eithinen,</HI> and <HI>Moel Fenlli,</HI> in this parish. This is called <HI>Bwlch Agricla,</HI> or the pass of <HI>Agriccla;</HI> and, since there is no other translation to be given of the <HI>welsh</HI> word, we may conjecture this to have been his passage to <HI>Mona.</HI> That the <HI>Romans</HI> were in after-times resident in these parts, is evident from the number of coins found
<PB N="389" REF="431"/>
in the neighborhood, particularly in the parish of <HI>Llanverres,</HI> where abundance of <HI>Denarii</HI> have been met with.</P>
<P>MOEL FENLLI, or <HI>Benlli</HI>'s hill, is remarkable for having on it a strong <HI>British</HI> post, guarded as usual by dikes and fosses. This probably was possessed by a chieftain of that name; for <HI>Nen∣nius</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">C. xxx. xxxi</NOTE> speaks of such a <HI>regulus</HI> of the country of <HI>Yale;</HI> but, as too usual with our antient historians, blends so ridiculous a legend with the mention of him, as would destroy belief of his existence, did not the hill remain a possible evidence. St. <HI>Ger∣manus,</HI> says the abbot, designed to make this <HI>Benlli</HI> a visit; but meeting with a most inhospitable reception, was kindly enter∣tained by a servant of the king in his humble cottage; who killed his only calf, dressed, and placed it before the saint and his companions. This goodness met with its reward; for lo! the next morning the identical calf was found alive and well with its mother.</P>
<P>A LITTLE beyond this pass, entered the parish of <HI>Llanverres,</HI> rich in mineral. Pass through the village, and by the church. The last is dedicated to St. <HI>Berres (Britius)</HI> disciple of St. <HI>Mar∣tin</HI> the <HI>Hungarian,</HI> and his succesor in the bishoprick of <HI>Tours,</HI> the latter end of the fourth century. The church at this time was rebuilding, chiefly by the bounty of Mrs. <HI>Catherine Jones</HI> of <HI>Clommendy.</HI></P>
<P>THE east end of the old church was repaired in 1650, by Dr. <HI>John Davies,</HI> the author of the <HI>Welsh-Latin</HI> dictionary, a most skilful antiquary; native of this parish.</P>
<P><PB N="390" REF="432"/>IN the course of my ride, cross the turnpike-road between <HI>Mold</HI> and <HI>Ruthyn;</HI> which, after a long ascent, passes <HI>Bwlch Pen∣y-Barras,</HI> a spot extremely worthy of the traveller's attention, on account of the beautiful view over the vale of <HI>Clwyd.</HI></P>
<P>MY route this time led me eastward, along the great road, into the county of FLINT.</P>
<P>THIS spot being confirmed to it by the event of a most ex∣pensive law-suit, by the court of exchequer, in 1763, between the <HI>Grosvenour</HI> family and the lords of the manor of <HI>Mold:</HI> the first claming it as part of his mineral grant of the hundred of <HI>Yale;</HI> the others affirming it to be part of the county of <HI>Flint,</HI> and within the parish of <HI>Mold.</HI> The decision, which was in favor of the lords of <HI>Mold,</HI> is recorded on an arch over a noted stone, called <HI>Carreg Carn March Arthur;</HI> which was then ad∣judged to be the boundary of the parish of <HI>Mold</HI> in the county of <HI>Flint,</HI> and of <HI>Llanverres</HI> in that of <HI>Denbigh.</HI></P>
<P>I CONTINUED along the great road; and, within two miles of <HI>Mold,</HI> hung long over the charming vale which opens with ex∣quisite beauty from <HI>Vron,</HI> the seat of the ingenious <HI>Richard Williams</HI> Esquire. <HI>Cambria</HI> here lays aside her majestic air, and condescends to assume a gentler form, in order to render less violent her approaching union with her <HI>English</HI> neighbor. It were to be wished she had acted with more moderation, and not outshone it at a rate, the most partial <HI>Saxon</HI> must allow it to have done.</P>
<P><PB N="391" REF="433"/>THIS was antiently called <HI>Ystrad-Alun,</HI> or the <HI>Strath</HI> of the <HI>alun;</HI> a comot in the cantref <HI>Y Rhiw:</HI> inhabited by a hardy race, at perpetual feud with the men of <HI>Cheshire</HI> on one side, and the men of <HI>Yale</HI> on the other: for my countrymen never suffered their active swords to rust; in default of <HI>Saxon,</HI> they would take up with the blood of their <HI>Cambrian</HI> neighbors.</P>
<P>ON the first regulation of the <HI>Welsh</HI> counties by <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. this vale, then called <HI>Molesdale,</HI> with the continuation of it which went under the name of <HI>Hopesdale,</HI> were annexed to the county of <HI>Denbigh;</HI> but, in the 33d year of the same monarch, were given to <HI>Flintsire.</HI></P>
<P>ALMOST the whole is seen from this spot; a delicious compo∣sition of rich land finely bounded by gentle risings, watered by <HI>Alun,</HI> and varied with a pretty town and fine church in the middle; with numbers of seats, groves, and well-cultivated farms. Among the former appears conspicuous, <HI>Leeswood,</HI> the creation of the late Sir <HI>George Wynne,</HI> rising palace-like along a fine slope on the south side of the vale, surrounded with woods and lawns; a sad <HI>Mausoleum</HI> of fugacious wealth! The distant view is not less beautiful. The three fine estuaries of the <HI>Dee, Weever,</HI> and <HI>Mersey,</HI> the hills of <HI>Cheshire,</HI> and the more remote range of those of <HI>Shropshire, Staffordshire, Derbyshire, Yorkshire, Lancashire, Westmoreland,</HI> and <HI>Cumberland,</HI> complete this beautiful scene.</P>
<P>FROM hence to the town of <HI>Mold</HI> is a pleasant ride. <HI>Mold</HI> consists principally of one broad and handsome street on a gentle rising, in the midst of a small but rich plain. The church is placed on an eminence; and is of the time of <HI>Henry</HI> VIII.
<PB N="392" REF="434"/>
adorned with a very handsome steeple built of late years. Before the Reformation, it belonged to the abby of <HI>Bustlesham,</HI> or <HI>By∣sham,</HI> in <HI>Berkshire.</HI> The living is a vicarage, and has dependent on it the chapelries of <HI>Nerquys</HI> and <HI>Treuddyn.</HI></P>
<P>THE architecture of the church is of the gothic of that pe∣riod, the windows large, and their arches obtuse. Within and without, is a row of animals carved, as usual at that period. The same may be observed on the old building over St. <HI>Winifrede</HI>'s well. The inside is extremely elegant; con∣sists of a nave and two ailes, supported by seven arches, whose pillars are much to be admired for their lightness. They consist of four round pilasters, with the intermediate space hollowed, and the capitals elegantly carved. Between the springs of every arch is an angel holding a shield, on which are either the arms of benefactors, or the instruments of the Passion. The arms of the <HI>Stanlies,</HI> who long possessed this manor, are very frequent. Among the other sculptures, is the <HI>Veronica,</HI> or face of our Saviour impressed on a handkerchief given to him by a woman on his way to the place of crucifixion. He took it, wiped his face, and returned it with the miraculous impression. This precious relique is preserved in St. <HI>Peter</HI>'s at <HI>Rome,</HI> and the woman worshipped as a saint, under the name of the <HI>Handker∣chief;</HI> which at first was called the <HI>Vera Icon,</HI> or true image; but becoming thus personified, received the title of St. <HI>Veronica.</HI> Beneath two windows above the chancel, are carved in a rude manner, the nails, pincers, and other tokens of the cruci∣fixion.</P>
<P><PB N="393" REF="435"/>AT the eastern ends of the two ailes are three gothic niches elegantly carved. They formerly were filled with images, now destroyed. The two in the south aile are almost hid with mo∣numents. Among them is a very superb one in memory of <HI>Robert Davies,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> of <HI>Llanerch,</HI> with his figure in a standing attitude, and dressed in a <HI>Roman</HI> habit.</P>
<P>NEAR it is a mural monument of his ancestor, another <HI>Robert Davies,</HI> of <HI>Gwysaney</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This gentleman died in 1666: the preceding, in <HI>May</HI> 1728.</NOTE>, the paternal seat of the family, and the residence, before the acquisition of <HI>Llanerch</HI> in the vale of <HI>Clwyd,</HI> by the marriage of this gentleman with <HI>Anne</HI> daughter and heiress to Sir <HI>Peter Mutton</HI> knight.</P>
<P>NOT far from <HI>Mold</HI> stands <HI>Gwysaney;</HI> a most respectable old house, beautifully situated. It was of strength sufficient to be garrisoned, in the time of the civil wars; and was taken, on the 12th of <HI>April</HI> 1645, by Sir <HI>William Brereton</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Whitelock,</HI> 142.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>NEAR this is an antient mural monument,<NOTE PLACE="marg">MONUMENTS.</NOTE> in memory of,<HI>Robert Warton,</HI> alias <HI>Parfew.</HI> He was first abbot of <HI>Bermondsey,</HI> and elected to the see of St. <HI>Asaph</HI> in 1536. He lived much at <HI>Denbigh</HI> and <HI>Wrexham</HI> during his continuance in this see<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>Willis's Bangor,</HI> 341. <HI>Cathedrals,</HI> i. 521. <HI>Athenae Oxon.</HI> i. 682.</NOTE> and was removed to that of <HI>Hereford</HI> in 1554, where he died in 1557. He was unjustly accused of impairing the revenues of this dio∣cese: on the contrary, it appears, that he had been a consi∣derable benefactor to the churches of <HI>Gresford, Wrexham,</HI> and <HI>Mold;</HI> which, probably, he found in an unfinished state. He was interred at <HI>Hereford,</HI> under a handsome tomb with his effi∣gies;
<PB N="394" REF="436"/>
but this grateful memorial of his benevolence to the church of <HI>Mold</HI> was erected, as an inscription beneath once informed, by one <HI>John ap Rys. Hoc opus factum fuerit, per John ap Rys.</HI> Above are his arms in a shield, quartered with those of the see of St. <HI>Asaph;</HI> and over them a label, inscribed, <HI>Robtus pmissione Divinâ Epus</HI> ASSAV. An angel supports one end; a bishop the other.</P>
<P>THE epitaph on the reverend Doctor <HI>Wynne,</HI> composed by him∣self, several years before his decease, merits publication.</P>

<P>In conformity to an antient usage, from a proper regard to decency, and a concern for the health of his fellow-creatures, he was moved to give particular directions for being buried in the adjoining church-yard, and not in the church.</P>
<P>And, as he scorned flattering of others while living, he has taken care to prevent being flattered himself when dead, by causing this small memorial to be set up in his life-time.</P>
<P>GOD, be merciful to me a sinner! Heb <HI>DDUW,</HI> Heb ddim.</P>
<P><PB N="395" REF="437"/>At the north-end of the town stands the mount, to which it owes the <HI>British</HI> and <HI>Latin</HI> names, YR WYDDGRUG, and MONS ALTUS, <HI>the lofty</HI> or <HI>conspicuous mount.</HI> This is partly natural, partly artificial. Our <HI>British</HI> ancestors, and afterwards the <HI>Saxons</HI> and <HI>Normans,</HI> taking advantage of so defencible an emi∣nence, cut it into form, and placed on it a castle. It is possible, that the <HI>Romans</HI> might also have had some concern in it; for a beautiful gold coin of <HI>Vespasian</HI> was found here; but this being the only proof of its having been possessed by them, I shall not insist on it any farther than to urge the probability; <HI>Mold</HI> being in the neighborhood of many of their mines, and of places where much of their money has been found.</P>
<P>THE mount is now called the <HI>Bailey</HI>-hill, from the word <HI>Bal∣lium,</HI> or castle-yard. It appears to have been strongly for∣tified by great ditches, notwithstanding its arduous ascent. It is divided into three parts: the lower <HI>Ballium</HI> or yard; the up∣per; and the keep, or <HI>Donjon.</HI> The tops of the two first are levelled by art; and all are separated by deep fosses. The keep was on a part greatly and artificially elevated; and around its edges are a few stones, the only reliques of the fortress. On one side of the upper yard are found vast quantities of bones, some human; others of animals, mostly domestic, such as of oxen, sheep, horses, and hogs; and a few remnants of horns of stags and roe-bucks.</P>
<P>THE summit of this hill commands a short but most exqui∣site view of the circumjacent vale; and to the west, <HI>Moel famma</HI> rises with aweful pre-eminence among the <HI>Clwydian</HI> hills.</P>
<P><PB N="396" REF="438"/>THE first certain account I have of this place is in the reign of <HI>William Rufus,</HI> when we find it in possession of <HI>Eustace Cruer</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Powel,</HI> 151.</NOTE>, who then did homage for <HI>Mold</HI> and <HI>Hopedale;</HI> he, probably, hav∣ing been the person who had ravished them from the antient owners.</P>

<P>AFTER this it was again restored; for we find in the <HI>aerae Cambro-Britannicae</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">At the end of <HI>Llwya</HI>'s Com∣mentariolum, 157.</NOTE>,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1198.</NOTE> that it was taken, in the winter of 1198, by <HI>Llewelyn ap Jorwerth:</HI> and about the year 1267 it was a third time besieged, taken, and demolished, by <HI>Gryffydd ap Gwenwynwyn,</HI> lord of <HI>Powis.</HI></P>

<P>I AM uncertain how long the crown reserved this lordship. I find it was granted to the <HI>Stanley</HI> family, perhaps to Sir <HI>John Stanley,</HI> by <HI>Henry</HI> IV. at the same time that he bestowed on him <HI>Hope</HI> and <HI>Hopedale.</HI> The earls of <HI>Derby</HI> possessed it till the exe∣cution of earl <HI>James;</HI> after which, both the manor of <HI>Hope</HI> and <HI>Mold</HI> were purchased by certain persons, who enjoyed them till the Restoration: after that event, a reference was made by his majesty, in 1662, to the lords, respecting the re-purchase of those manors by the earl of <HI>Derby;</HI> in which it had been agreed by his lordship, to pay the parties, on the 26th of <HI>March</HI> 1664, the sum of eleven thousand pounds, and to be put into full possession of the manors. The lords imagined that every thing had been adjusted; but the earl of <HI>Derby</HI> refusing to per∣form his part, the referrees layed the affair before the king; who, on the 14th of <HI>June</HI> 1664, ordered that the former purchasers should remain in quiet possession. The <HI>Derby</HI> family, by some
<PB N="399" REF="441"/>
means, regained the lordship of <HI>Hope;</HI> but that of <HI>Mold</HI> is at present the property of lady <HI>Vincent.</HI> The mineral advantages of the manor, which have, at times, been very considerable, are equally, divided between her ladyship, the <HI>Trevors,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Lloyd</HI> of <HI>Tyddyn.</HI></P>
<P>FROM <HI>Mold,</HI> I took the west side of the vale; a tract filled with numbers of gentlemen's seats of independent fortunes, as yet not caught and absorbed in the gulphy vortex of our <HI>Leviathans.</HI> These are the remnants of the custom of gavel-kind, so prevalent formerly in <HI>North Wales,</HI> and which have re∣mained unimproved by those accidents which, by time and chance, happen to many. I digressed a little to the right, to see the magnificent gates of <HI>Leeswood,</HI> the seat of the late Sir <HI>George Wynne</HI> baronet: and a little higher up to <HI>Tower,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">TOWER.</NOTE> to enjoy the witty, the lively and agreeable conversation of the reverend Doctor <HI>William Wynne</HI> (now departed). This gentleman was one of those who kept the patrimony derived from a long train of an∣cestors, without increase, yet without impair. The house is small; but part of it is a true specimen of the border-houses on the confines of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Scotland:</HI> a square tower: of three stories. In the lower, still remains a staple in the ceiling; a memorial of the rudeness of the times. During the wars be∣tween the houses of <HI>York</HI> and <HI>Lancaster,</HI> this place was inhabited by <HI>Reinallt ap Gryffydd ap Bleddyn,</HI> one of the six gallant captains who defended <HI>Harlech</HI> castle on the part of <HI>Henry</HI> VI. He and his people were in continual feud with the citizens of <HI>Chester.</HI> In 1465, a considerable number of the latter came to <HI>Mold</HI> fair; a fray ensued between the two parties; a dreadful
<PB N="400" REF="442"/>
slaughter was made on both sides: but <HI>Reinallt</HI> got the victory; took prisoner <HI>Robert Bryne</HI> linen-draper, and mayor of <HI>Chester</HI> in 1461, whom he led to his tower, and hung on the staple in his great hall. An attempt was made afterwards to seize <HI>Reinallt;</HI> and two hundred tall men sallied from <HI>Chester</HI> for that purpose. He retired from his house to a neighboring wood, permitted part of his enemies to enter the building; then rushing from his cover, fastened the door; and, setting fire to the place, burnt them with∣out mercy: he then attacked the rest, pursued them to the sea-side, where those who escaped the sword, perished in the channel. His actions were celebrated at the time, in poems still extant; particularly by <HI>Lewis Glyn Cothi,</HI> in an <HI>Awdl</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A <HI>Cywydd</HI> and an <HI>Awdl</HI> differ in these respects: the first consists of cou∣plets generally of seven syllables; the last of stan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>as of different lengths of metre; somewhat like a <HI>Pindaric</HI> ode.</NOTE>, in praise of <HI>Reinallt.</HI> It seems <HI>Lewis</HI> had married a widow of <HI>Chester,</HI> against the consent of the inhabitants; who spoiled him of all his ef∣fects. This whetted the poet's satyr: <Q>Who summons the ministry of angels and of devils to his assistance; and pours a profusion of curses on <HI>Caer Lleon</HI> and its people. He wishes water to drown, fire to burn, and air to infect the hated place; and that grass might grow in every part, except the sacred edifices, of this habitation of the seven deadly sins.</Q></P>
<P>THE TOWER, in old times, was called after the name of this hero. It was also named <HI>Bryn-coed,</HI> from the wood that might have surrounded it. In the time of <HI>Leland</HI> it was inhabited by <HI>John Wynn ap Robert.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="401" REF="443"/>I DESCENDED into my former road, and passed along the course of the <HI>Terrig,</HI> or the <HI>violent;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">TERRIG.</NOTE> at this time a trifling brook; but often of a tremendous swell and fury.

<P>FARTHER on is <HI>Hartsheath,</HI> the house of <HI>Guillim Wardle</HI> esquire, descended, by the female line, from the <HI>Lloyds</HI> of the same place. It is most beautifully seated on a long rising, insulated by the vale, and finely wooded and cultivated. The house stands on the southern extremity, and commands a most elegant view of the valley, divided by the insulated rock of <HI>Caergwrle,</HI> soaring out of the valley, and capped with a ruined castle.</P>
<P>A LITTLE further up the vale stands <HI>Plâs-Têg;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">PLAS-TEG.</NOTE> a singular house, belonging to the <HI>Trevors;</HI> but, for numbers of years, oc∣cupied by farmers.

In the centre is a hall forty-three feet long by twenty-three. A spacious stair-case; and above, is a dining-room of the same dimensions with the hall, and twelve feet nine inches high. At each corner of the house is a square wing or tower,
<PB N="402" REF="444"/>
consisting (as does the centre) of five floors. In each is a room twenty-two feet six, by nineteen six; and within each of these rooms a closet thirteen feet seven inches square.</P>
<P>THIS house was built in 1610 by Sir <HI>John Trevor</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Epitaph in <HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pe</HI> church.</NOTE>, a second son of the branch of <HI>Trevalun.</HI> The design is attributed to <HI>Inigo Jones;</HI> but I doubt the tradition.

<P>FROM hence I pursued my journey to <HI>Caergwrle,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">CAERGWRLE.</NOTE> a village on the banks of the <HI>Alun,</HI> in the parish of <HI>Hope</HI> or <HI>Estyn,</HI> whose form speaks it to have been a <HI>Roman</HI> station, which appears very evident to the antiquarian eye, from the summit of the adjacent rock, the site of the castle. The precincts shew them∣selves to have been rectangular, with one side formed by the s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ope along the banks of the river. Here is yet preserved the antient disposition, in three broad streets, running parallel, and three narrower intersecting them at right angles. It had been only a small place, an out-post to <HI>Deva;</HI> but had the usual con∣comitants of <HI>Roman</HI> luxury.<NOTE PLACE="marg">RO<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>.</NOTE> In <HI>Camden</HI>'s time (1606) a <HI>hy∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/></HI> was discovered near the place five ells long, four broad, and half an ell high, cut out of the live rock.

<PB N="403" REF="445"/>
<HI>Hope,</HI> the seat of the family of the same name. I have also heard, that large beds of iron cinders have been discovered near <HI>Caer Estyn</HI> in this parish, the supposed works of the <HI>Romans.</HI></P>
<P>BESIDES these proofs, here is the trace of a <HI>Roman</HI> road, pointing from the village towards <HI>Mold,</HI> and is visible in two or three places; especially in the fields on this side of <HI>Plâs-têg.</HI> I think that part of the present road was a portion of the <HI>Roman.</HI> An artificial mount stands close on its course.<NOTE PLACE="marg">ROADS.</NOTE> Another road points towards <HI>Hawarden;</HI> which increases my suspicion of that having also been a <HI>Roman</HI> out-post. As the word <HI>street</HI> is generally a sign of a <HI>Roman</HI> road, there might have been a third on the <HI>Wrexham</HI> side of <HI>Caergwrle;</HI> for we find on that road, <HI>Croes y street</HI> passing over a place called <HI>Cesn y Bêdd,</HI> or the hill of the grave, and leading to the castle.

<P>THIS place, in the division of <HI>Wales</HI> by <HI>Roderic</HI> the great, formed part of the <HI>Cantref y Rhiw.</HI> When the <HI>Saxons</HI> made a con∣quest

It is a common notion in the country, that the last was effected by the interest of the earl of <HI>Derby,</HI> in or∣der to have his <HI>Welsh</HI> estates in the same county; for at that time, the family was possessed of <HI>Hawarden, Molesdale,</HI> and this <HI>manor;</HI> which had been granted, on <HI>January</HI> 1st 1401, by <HI>Henry</HI> IV. to Sir <HI>John Stanley.</HI> The family had at the same time, the lordship of <HI>Maelor Saesneg,</HI> which was a portion of <HI>Flintshire</HI> since its first being formed into a county.

<P>THE castle of <HI>Caergwrle</HI> stood on the summit of a great rock,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CASTLE.</NOTE> precipitous on one side, and of steep ascent on the others. Some of the walls, and part of a round tower still remain, suf∣ficient to shew, that its size was never great. Close to it, on the accessible parts, it was protected by very deep fosses cut through the rock. On the north-east side, there is a pretty extensive area; and round its verge the vestiges of a rampart of earth and stones, and a foss, such as usual in the <HI>British</HI> posts: it may be therefore supposed, that it had been possessed by the <HI>Britons</HI> in early times; and that it served to defend, in conjunc∣tion
<PB N="405" REF="447"/>
with <HI>Caer Estyn,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">CAER ESTYN.</NOTE> a <HI>British</HI> post of one rampart and ditch on the opposite side of the dale above the village, the entrance through this pass into <HI>Wales.</HI> The vale almost closes in this place, leaving only room enough for the <HI>Alun</HI> to flow through its picturesque dingles, till it gains the open country near the church of <HI>Gresford.</HI></P>
<P>I CANNOT trace the founder of this castle.<NOTE PLACE="marg">FOUNDER.</NOTE> It probably was one of the few <HI>Welsh</HI> fortresses that we have to boast of. Its oblong form; its comparative deficiency of towers; and its ge∣neral agreement in structure, with others whole origin I am ac∣quainted with, make me willing to suppose it the work of our countrymen, after they had recovered possession of this tract.

<P>DAVID, brother to <HI>Llewelyn,</HI> last prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> held it from <HI>Edward</HI> I. <HI>David</HI> made great complaints of the injurious treat∣ment he met with from <HI>Roger de Clifford,</HI> the justiciary of <HI>Chester,</HI> who cut down his woods about <HI>Hope;</HI> and endeavored to dispos∣sess him of his rights<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The same, 350.</NOTE>. When <HI>David</HI> took up arms in defence of his brother, he left a garrison in this castle; but in <HI>June</HI> 1282, it surrendered to the <HI>English</HI> monarch.

The effect was, purging, griping, and sickness at the stomach, which went off in a few days, and then

produced a good appetite. Dr. <HI>Short</HI> gives an instance of a woman in a deplorable situation from a deep scurvy, who was perfectly restored by the use of these springs.</P>
<P>FROM the village of <HI>Hope,</HI> I returned on the north side of the valley; re-passed <HI>Mold;</HI> and, about a mile west of the town, visited <HI>Maes-Garmon;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">MAES-GARMON.</NOTE> a spot that still retains the name of the saintly commander in the celebrated battle, the <HI>Victoria Alleluic∣tica,</HI> fought in 420, between the <HI>Britons,</HI> headed by the bishops <HI>Germanus</HI> and <HI>Lupus,</HI> and a crowd of pagan <HI>Picts</HI> and <HI>Saxons,</HI> who were carrying desolation through the country.

<P>THIS valley is a boundary of the mineral tract of our county.<NOTE PLACE="marg">MINERAL TRACT.</NOTE> I shall now take a kind of bird's eye view of the whole, which I surrounded, beginning with the northern extremity. The highland part may be divided into two.<NOTE PLACE="marg">FIRST DIVISION.</NOTE> The first is insulated by valley, plain, and sea.

<P>THE second division is separated from the first by a deep de∣pression of the country between <HI>Rhos Esmor,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">SECOND DIVISION.</NOTE> and the parish of <HI>Mold.</HI> There is even in the lower parts, on the west side, a chain of mines. But the land rises again at <HI>Mold</HI> mountain, and the mineral tract is continued through the parishes of <HI>Llanverres,</HI> the eastern sides of <HI>Llanarmon, Llandegla,</HI> the <HI>Glisseg</HI> rocks, and <HI>Minera</HI> above <HI>Wrexham.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="416" REF="458"/>THE middle of the first division is entirely limestone, as is the western side, from <HI>Dalar goch</HI> to <HI>Rhos Esmor:</HI> from thence, or on the eastern side the strata alters.<NOTE PLACE="marg">LIME-STONE.</NOTE> Towards the skirts of the hills,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHERT.</NOTE> it changes to that flinty substance called <HI>chert,</HI> more or less pure.<NOTE PLACE="marg">SHALE.</NOTE> Lower down it degenerates into shale of a black stone, soon dissoluble in the air.

<P>THE same observations might be made on the <HI>strata</HI> in the se∣cond division.

<P>WAS I to continue my aerial speculation, I should see a dis∣continuance of the limestone <HI>strata</HI> till they rose on the opposite side of the vale of <HI>Clwyd.</HI> My eye would catch the most remote part on the northern side of <HI>Red Wharf-bay</HI> in <HI>Anglesea,</HI> insulated far from any other.

<HI>Coed Marchon</HI> beyond <HI>Ruthyn,</HI> which yield to the industrious farmer, by their excellent lime, a manure more certainly pro∣ductive of wealth, than the precarious search after the deep-hid minerals.</P>
<P>THE limestone and the chert of our mineral tracts are of unknown depth; neither their bottom, nor that of the fissars or veins which cross them, have ever been discovered.<NOTE PLACE="marg">DEPTH OF VEINS.</NOTE> The ore of lead has been followed to the depth of a hundred and thirty, or a hundred and forty yards, and then has ceased; but the unprofitable vein appears below unclosed. Our mines, as I have shewn before, have been worked from very early times<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 51.</NOTE>, but not without long interruptions. But as several of our veins have been pursued for a hundred years past, the point may be affirmed of the depth to which they bear ore in our coun∣try.</P>
<P>THE veins run either north and south, or east and west.<NOTE PLACE="marg">THEIR COURSE.</NOTE> But it is remarkable, that the lead ore got in the first, scarcely ever produces a quantity of silver worth the refiner's labor. The ores of <HI>Mold</HI> mountain, and <HI>Minera,</HI> yield scarcely any silver.</P>
<P>THE minerals of the tracts in question, are ore of lead, ca∣lamine, or <HI>Lapis calaminaris;</HI> and a mineral, that answers the same purpose, called by the miners <HI>black jack.</HI></P>
<P>OUR ores of lead differ in quality. The lamellated,<NOTE PLACE="marg">ORES OF LEAD: THEIR PRODUCE OF LEAD.</NOTE> or com∣mon kind, usually named <HI>potters ore,</HI> yields from fourteen to sixteen hundred and a quarter of lead, from twenty hundred of the ore: but the last produce is rare.</P>
<P><PB N="418" REF="460"/>THE quantity of silver produced from our lead is also va∣riable.<NOTE PLACE="marg">OF SILVER.</NOTE> The upper part of a vein of lead ore is always richest in silver; the bottom, in lead. Our refiners will assay any lead that will yield ten ounces in the ton of lead and upwards. The usual produce is fourteen ounces: sixteen have been gotten; but acquisitions of that kind within this circuit are extremely uncommon.</P>
<P>SOME years ago, a green lead ore was discovered in the <HI>silver</HI> rake on <HI>Halkin</HI> mountain.<NOTE PLACE="marg">GREEN LEAD-ORE.</NOTE> Only a small quantity was found, which yielded about thirteen hundred and a quarter from a tun of the ore. It was of a very stubborn quality, and resisted the greatest powers of the blast furnace before it would yield any metal.</P>
<P>THE brown or whitish stoney species of ore called <HI>Caulk,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">BROWN, OR CAULK.</NOTE> pro∣duce from five hundred and a quarter to eleven hundred of lead from the ton. The smelters likewise get from what is called <HI>waste,</HI> or the hillocks, which are the refuse of good ores, so mixed with clay, gravel, stone, or calamine, as not to be separated but by fire, from ten to thirteen hundred of lead per ton.</P>
<P>WE have had at different periods mines productive of vast wealth in several parts of this tract.<NOTE PLACE="marg">RICH MINES.</NOTE> The richest vein was dis∣covered about fifty years ago at <HI>Rowley</HI>'s rake, or <HI>Pant y Pwll dwr</HI> on <HI>Halkin</HI> mountain, continued with some interruption into a small inclosure, the property of Sir <HI>George Wynne</HI> of <HI>Leeswood,</HI> and the freehold of Mr. <HI>David Hughes;</HI> which, in less than thirty years, yielded to different proprietors, adventurers, and smelters, above a million of money. The reader will naturally expect to find in these parts a nation of <HI>Craesus</HI>'s; but <HI>citò parta,</HI>
<PB N="419" REF="461"/>
<HI>citò dilabuntur.</HI> It is at this time an undetermined question, whether more wealth has been gotten out of the earth, or more lost in the search after the prizes in this subterraneous lottery.</P>
<P>MUCH of the ore obtained in our country is smelted in the several furnaces belonging to different companies: much also is exported in the form of ore. I wished to be acquainted with the annual quantity smelted from those of the country; but found, by reason of the ores imported from <HI>Scotland</HI> and other parts, that the computation would be of insuperable difficulty. All the lead and ore is exported from the port of <HI>Chester,</HI> a small quantity excepted, consumed by the plumbers and other trades in the adjacent parts. I therefore refer the reader to pages 196, 197, for the number of tuns sent from that port in the years 1771, 1776. By the favor of Mr. <HI>Jken,</HI> collector, I am per∣mitted to say, that, from the year 1758 to <HI>Christmas</HI> 1777, the following quantities have been entered in the custom-house, fo∣reign and coast-ways.</P>

<P>THE reader need not be told, that the former were the years of mineral plenty; and such, which I must say, are seldom known. There are five other smelting houses; but I believe none equalled this in the quality of silver. This precious metal is chiefly bought by the artificers at <HI>Sheffield</HI> and <HI>Birmingham.</HI></P>
<P>CALAMINE is found in great abundance in the veins of lime∣stone and chert, in the same manner as the ores of lead. Where there is plenty of the former, there is little or none of the lat∣ter. The calamine is also entirely confined to the eastern side of the country. About a thousand tons of this mineral is an∣nually exported. I have mentioned, in p. 62. how little it was known in <HI>Flintshire</HI> till within these sixty years; and may here add, that we were indebted to <HI>John Barrow,</HI> a native of <HI>Somerset∣shire,</HI> who being well acquainted with that mineral in his own country, pointed out to us its uses.</P>
<P>CALAMINE assumes various shapes and colors. Green, yellow, red, and black, often has a stony appearance, and often like the lattice work of bones. The richest looks like bees-wax; but that species is not common any more than the curious cry∣stallized specimens.</P>
<P>THE ores of <HI>Zink,</HI> called here <HI>black jack,</HI> are met with in our mines. We have it in a metallic form of a bluish grey color;

and burns and destroys in a dreadful manner,<NOTE PLACE="marg">FIRE-DAMP.</NOTE> as the colliers, through negligence, in not setting fire to the vapor be∣fore it gets to a head, do often experience. The most tremen∣dous instance was on <HI>February</HI> 3d, 1675, in a coal-work at <HI>Mos∣tyn,</HI> which I shall relate from the <HI>Philosophical Transactions</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">N<SUP>o</SUP> 136. or Vol. ii. 378. <HI>Lowthorb</HI>'s Abridgement. The account was drawn up by Mr. <HI>Roger Mostyn.</HI></NOTE>; and so conclude the account of our mineral concerns.</P>
<Q><P>The damp had been perceived for some time before,<NOTE PLACE="marg">IN MOSTYN COLLIERY.</NOTE> resem∣bling fiery blades darting and crossing each other from both sides of the pit. The usual methods were taken to free the pit from this evil. After a cessation of work for three days, the steward thinking to fetch a compass about from the eye of the pit that came from the day, and to bring wind by a secure way along with him, that, if it burst again, it might be done without danger of men's lives, went down, and took two men along with him, which served his turn for this purpose. He was no sooner down, but the rest of the work∣men that had wrought there, disdaining to be left behind in such a time of danger, hasted down after them; and one of them, more indiscreet than the rest, went headlong with his candle over the eye of the damp-pit, at which the damp im∣mediately catched, and flew to and fro over all the hollows of the work, with a great wind, and a continual fire; and, as it went, keeping a mighty great roaring noise on all sides.</P>
<P>THE men, at first appearance of it, had most of them fallen upon their faces, and hid themselves as well as they could, in
<PB N="423" REF="465"/>
the loose, slack, or small-coal, and under the shelter of posts; yet, nevertheless, the damp returning out of the hollows, and drawing towards the eye of the pit, it came up with incredible force; the wind and fire tore most of their clothes off their backs, and singed what was left, burning their hair, faces, and hands; the blasts falling so sharp on their skin, as if they had been whipt with cords. Some, that had lest shelter, were carried fifteen or sixteen yards from their first station, and beaten against the roof of the coal, and sides of the post, and lay afterwards a good while senseless; so that it was long be∣fore they could hear or find one another. As it drew up to the day-pit, it caught one of the men along with it, that was next to the eye; and up it comes, with such a terrible crack, not unlike, but more shrill, than a cannon, that was heard fif∣teen miles off, with the wind; and such a pillar of smoak, as darkened all the sky over-head for a good while. The brow of the hill above the pit was eighteen yards high, and on it grew trees of fourteen or fifteen yards long; yet the man's body, and other things from the pit, were seen above the tops of the highest trees, at least 100 yards. On this pit stood a horse-engine of substantial timber, and strong iron work; on which lay a trunk, or barrel, for winding the rope up and down, of above 1000 pounds weight; it was then in motion, one bucket going down, and the other coming up full of wa∣ter. This trunk was fastened to that frame with locks and bolts of iron; yet it was thrown up, and carried a good way from the pit; and pieces of it, though bound with iron-hoops and strong nails, blown into the woods about: so likewise were
<PB N="244" REF="466"/>
the two buckets; and the ends of the rope, after the buckets were blown from them, stood a while upright in the air like pikes, and then came leisurely drilling down. The whole frame of the engine was stirred, and moved out of its place; and those mens clothes, caps, and hats, that escaped, were afterwards found shattered to pieces, and thrown amongst the woods a great way from the pit.</P></Q>
<P>FROM <HI>Nannerch,</HI> I continued my journey along the narrow vale, picturesquely ornamented with hanging woods. Leave the church of <HI>Skeiviog</HI> on the right.

<PB N="425" REF="467"/><HI>Caer,</HI> the fortress and <HI>Gwŷs,</HI> a summon, which shews it had been in early times, the place of judicature; and it certainly had that honor long before it was removed to the county-town of <HI>Flint.</HI> I will not assert that it had been a <HI>Roman</HI> station, notwithstanding I am credibly informed, that in the present century, a number of copper coins were found in a bottom below the town; and there still remains in the parish, a Latin inscription, cut in rude letters, on an unhewn upright stone to this effect: HIC JACIT MULI ERBO . . . . OBIIT. Multitudes of <HI>tumuli</HI> are scattered over the neighborhood; and one very near to it. This plain, probably, had been a field of bat∣tle. Whether this inscription referred to any heroine that fell on this place, I will not dare to affirm. It is an unfinish∣ed piece, <HI>Hic jacit mulier</HI> BO—and, at a distance, the word <HI>obiit.</HI></P>
<P>CAERWYS<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Powel,</HI> 360.</NOTE>, with a neighboring town now lost, called <HI>Tref Edwyn,</HI> and <HI>Rhuddlan,</HI> had been, from very early time, the seats of the judicature for these parts of <HI>Wales.</HI> In 1281, the noble∣men of <HI>Tegengl</HI> layed before the archbishop of <HI>Canterbury</HI> (who came down on the Christian design of reconciling the differ∣ences between <HI>Edward</HI> I. and <HI>Llewelyn</HI>) the infringement of their liberties in this particular; asserting, that it was the tenor of their privilege to be judged according to the laws of <HI>Wales,</HI> at those three places; and that the best men of the country were taken because they desired to be judged at <HI>Tref Edwyn</HI> by the laws of <HI>Wales</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. How far their complaints were remedied does
<PB N="426" REF="468"/>
not appear: but when justiciary courts were in after times ap∣pointed, <HI>Caerwys</HI> recovered its antient honors. In this town were held the great sessions. It had its town-hall, and its jail; and was the place of execution. It remained the place of ju∣dicature till sometime past the middle of the last century, when the courts were removed to <HI>Flint.</HI></P>
<P>IN the year 1241, or the 26th of <HI>Henry</HI> III. that prince granted to the inhabitants of <HI>Tegengl,</HI> a charter<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Mostyn</HI> MSS.</NOTE>, exempting them from the <HI>amobr;</HI> but at the same time, imposes on them an obliga∣tion to find twenty-four people, who were to keep the peace of the country: and obliges this town, <HI>Picton, Axton,</HI> and other hamlets, to find three men each, to work three days in the harvest, as they were wont in the days of the two preceding <HI>Welsh</HI> princes. This seems during some temporary advantage which <HI>Henry</HI> had over the <HI>Welsh.</HI></P>
<P>CAERWYS has the most considerable fairs for cattle, sheep and horses, in all the county. They are of great antiquity. The first <HI>John Trevor,</HI> bishop of St. <HI>Asaph,</HI> appears among the sub∣scribers to a charter for a market in 1356; but the markets have now failed entirely, since the increase of <HI>Holywell.</HI></P>
<P>THE earl of <HI>Plymouth</HI> is lord of this manor; and possesses, by purchase of an ancestor, the estate of the <HI>Griffiths,</HI> descended from <HI>Ednowen-Bendew,</HI> one of the fifteen tribes, whose seat is still standing, inhabited by tenants.</P>
<P>BUT what gave a particular glory to the town of <HI>Caerwys,</HI> was the honor it had of being the place of the <HI>Eisteddfod,</HI> or the
<PB N="427" REF="469"/>
sessions of the bards and minstrels for many centuries. It was the resort of those of a certain district; as <HI>Aberfraw</HI> in <HI>Anglesea</HI> was of those of that island, and the neighboring county; and <HI>Mathraval</HI> of those of the land of <HI>Powys.</HI> The reason that these places were thus distinguished, was, because the two last were the residence of princes; and <HI>Caerwys,</HI> on account of the royal palace that stood below the town, the residence of <HI>Llewelyn ap Gryffydd.</HI></P>
<P>THESE <HI>Eisteddfods</HI> were the <HI>British Olympics.</HI> Fired at first with generous emulation, our poets crowded into the list, and carried off the prize, contented with the mere honor of vic∣tory. At length, when the competitors became numerous, and the country became oppressed with the multitude, new regula∣tions of course took place. The disappointed candidates were no longer suffered to torture the ears of the principality with their wretched compositions. None but bards of merit were suffered to rehearse their pieces; and minstrels of skill, to perform. These went through a long probation: judges were appointed to decide on their respective abilities; and degrees suitable were conferred, and permissions granted for exercising their ta∣lents, in the manner that will be related in the following pages. The judges were appointed by commission from our princes; and after the conquest of <HI>Wales,</HI> by the kings of <HI>England,</HI> notwithstanding, <HI>Edward</HI> I. exercised a political cruelty over the generation of bards of his time; yet future princes thought fit to revive an institution so likely to soften the manners of a fierce people. The crown had the power of nominating the judges, who decided not only on the merit, but the subject of
<PB N="428" REF="470"/>
the poems; and, like our modern lord chamberlains, were cer∣tain of licensing only those which were agreeable to the <HI>English</HI> court.</P>
<P>BEFORE I enter on the account of the succession of <HI>British Eisteddsfods,</HI> I shall just mention the high antiquity of the cha∣racter that made,<NOTE PLACE="marg">ANTIENT BARDS.</NOTE> in after times, the principal figure in these meetings. The <HI>Bardi</HI> (the <HI>Beirdds</HI> of the <HI>Britons</HI>) were of great authority among the <HI>Celtic</HI> nations: the <HI>Germans</HI> were animated in battle by verses delivered in a deep and solemn tone<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Tacitus</HI> de mor. German, lib. vi. 246.</NOTE>. among the <HI>Gauls</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Strabo,</HI> lib. iv. 302. <HI>Athenaeus,</HI></NOTE>, they sung the actions of great men; and particularly, celebrated in their hymns, the heroes who fell in fight:</P>
<Q><L>Vos quoque qui fortes animas belloque peremtas</L>
<L>Laudibus in longum vates dimittis in aevum</L>
<L>Plurima fecuri fudistis carmina BARDI.</L>
<BIBL>LUCAN. i.</BIBL></Q>
<Q><L>YOU too, ye bards, whom sacred rapture fire</L>
<L>To chaunt your heroes to your country's lyre,</L>
<L>Who consecrate in your immortal strain,</L>
<L>Brave patriot souls in righteous battle slain;</L>
<L>Securely now the tuneful task renew,</L>
<L>And noblest themes in deathless songs pursue.</L>
<BIBL>ROWE.</BIBL></Q>
<P>IT is highly probable, that the bards and minstrels were under certain regulations during the time of <HI>Druidism;</HI> but we find no
<PB N="429" REF="471"/>
proofs of them till long after;<NOTE PLACE="marg">IN TIME OF CAP∣WALADR:</NOTE> till the days of <HI>Cadwaladr,</HI> last king of <HI>Britain,</HI> who died at <HI>Rome</HI> about the year 688. Of him it is said, that being at an assembly of this nature, with his nobles, there came a minstrel, and played in a key so displeasing, that he and all his brethren were prohibited, under a severe pe∣nalty, from ever playing on it any more; but were ordered to adopt that of <HI>Mwynen Gwynedd,</HI> or the sweet key of Gwy∣nedd<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">North Wales.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>I IMAGINE,<NOTE PLACE="marg">OF ARTHUR:</NOTE> that previous to this, there had been musical re∣gulations in <HI>Britain;</HI> for I find that a tune, called <HI>Gosteg yr Halen,</HI> or the <HI>Prelude of the Salt,</HI> was always played whenever the salt-seller was placed before king <HI>Arthur</HI>'s, knights, at his round table<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>Morris</HI>'s MSS. of <HI>British</HI> music.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>AFTER <HI>Cadwaladr,</HI> the next princes who undertook the re∣form of our minstrelsie, were <HI>Bleddyn ap Cynfyn</HI> and <HI>Gryssydd ap Cynan.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">OF GRYFFYDD AP CYNAN</NOTE> The first was cotemporary with the conqueror; the last with king <HI>Stephen.</HI> These enacted, that no person should follow the <HI>profession</HI> of bard or minstrel, but such only who were admitted by the <HI>Eisteddfod,</HI> which was held once in three years. They were prohibited from invading one another's province: nor were they permitted to degrade themselves by following any <HI>other</HI> occupation. Neither of these were to demand above ten shillings in any article, under pain of losing the whole, besides being suspended from their profession for three years<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>Leges Wallieae,</HI> 35.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>AFTER the times of the princes, the great men, their descen∣dants, took these people under their care and protection, allow∣ing
<PB N="430" REF="472"/>
them the liberty of circuiting their respective territories thrice a year, viz. at <HI>Christmas, Easter,</HI> and <HI>Whitsuntide;</HI> and the whole principality once in three years.</P>
<P>THE bards were in the highest repute. I cannot give a strong∣er idea of the esteem they were in, than by citing from the <HI>Welsh</HI> laws, the account of their rank in the prince's court, and the various rewards and fees they were entitled to, and the severe penalties that were enacted to preserve their persons from insult. They were supposed to be endowed with powers equal to inspi∣ration. They were the oral historians of all past transactions, public and private. They related the great events of the state; and, like the <HI>scalds</HI> of the northern nations, retained the memo∣ry of numberless transactions, which otherwise would have pe∣rished in oblivion. They were likewise thoroughly acquainted with the works of the three primary bards, <HI>viz.</HI> MYRDDYN AP MORFRYN, MYRDDYN EMRYS, and TALIESIN BEN BEIRDD. But they had another talent, which probably endeared them more than all the rest to the <HI>Welsh</HI> nobility; that of being most accom∣plished genealogists, and flattering their vanity, in singing the deeds of an ancestry derived from the most distant period.</P>
<P>THE BARDD TEULU, or COURT BARD, held the eighth place in the prince's court. He possessed his land free. The prince supplied him with a horse and woollen robe, and the princess with linen<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Leges Wallicae, 35.</NOTE>. He sat next to the governor of the palace at the three great festivals; for, at those seasons, the governor was to deliver him his harp<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The same, 35, and 16.</NOTE> On the same festivals, he was also to
<PB N="431" REF="473"/>
have the <HI>Disdain</HI>'s, or steward of the houshold's garment for his f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e.</P>
<P>WHEN a song is called for, the <HI>Cadeir-fardd,</HI> or the bard who has got the <HI>badge of the chair,</HI> is first to sing a hymn in glory of GOD; after that, another in honor of the prince. When those are over, the <HI>Teuluwr,</HI> or bard of the hall, is to sing some other subject.</P>
<P>IF the princess calls for a song after she has retired from table to her apartment, the <HI>Teuluwr</HI> must sing to her highness in a low voice, least he should disturb the performers in the hall. <HI>John Dafydd Rhys</HI> says, that the subject was to be on death; but I rather follow <HI>Wotton,</HI> who, instead of <HI>angau,</HI> which signifies <HI>death,</HI> prefers the word <HI>amgen,</HI> or a <HI>separate subject</HI> from what was sung in the hall.</P>
<P>WHEN the bard goes with the prince's servants on a plun∣dering expedition, and performs before them his animating com∣positions, he is to have the finest heifer of the booty; and in case the detachment was drawn up in order of battle, he was to sing at their head, the <HI>praises of the</HI> British <HI>monarchy.</HI> This was to remind them of their antient right to the whole kingdom; for their inroads being almost always on the <HI>English</HI> territories, they thought they did no more than seize on their own.</P>
<P>THE prince bestowed on him an ivory chess-board; others say a harp: and the princess a golden ring. His lodging was to be with the governor of the palace.</P>
<P>WHEN he is required to sing with other bards, by way of distinction, he is to have a double portion.</P>
<P><PB N="423" REF="474"/>IF the bard asks any favor of the prince, he must sing one of his compositions: if of a nobleman, three: if of a common person, he must sing till he is so weary as to rest on his elbow, or to fall asleep. This, I fear, shews our bards were a very impor∣tuning race, and required a check; yet still they were in high estimation. Their <HI>Gwerth,</HI> or compensation for their life, was rated at cxxvi cows<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">leges Wallicae, 37.</NOTE>, and any injury done them, at vi cows and cxx pence.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Merch-Gobr</HI> of his daughter,<NOTE PLACE="marg">MERCH-GOBR.</NOTE> or marriage fine of his daughter, was cxx pence. Her <HI>cowyll, argyffreu,</HI> or nuptial pre∣sents, was thirty shillings; and her portion three pounds<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid. 37.</NOTE>. It is remarkable, that the PENCERDD GWLAD, or chief of the fa∣culty, was entitled to the <HI>merch-gobr,</HI> or <HI>amobr</HI> for the daughters of all the inferiors of the faculty within the district, who payed xxiv pence on their marriage; which not only shews the anti∣quity, but the great authority of these people.</P>
<P>THE PENCERDD was not among the<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ibid. 68.</NOTE> officers of the court: but occasionally sat in the tenth place. He also had his land free; was to perform much in the same manner as the court bard, whom he seems to have taken place of, whenever he attended; for, when the <HI>Pencerdd</HI> was present, the former sat only in the twelfth seat. No other was to play without li∣cense from him. His death was valued at cxxvi cows; and any injury done him, at vi cows, and cxx pence. Each of the chief musicians was to receive from their lord, the first,
<PB N="433" REF="475"/>
a harp; the second, a <HI>crwth;</HI> the third, a pipe; which, on their deaths, were to revert to the lord<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Leges Wallicae, 68.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE prince's harp was valued at cxx pence, and that of <HI>Pen∣cerdd</HI> at the same; the key at xxiv pence: a gentleman's harp was estimated at lx pence.</P>
<P>POWEL<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">191.</NOTE> says, that <HI>Gryffydd ap Cynan</HI> brought over with him out of <HI>Ireland,</HI> divers cunning musicians, who devised in a man∣ner, all the instrumental music now used. With all respect to our sister kingdom, I must imagine, that if our instruments were not originally <HI>British,</HI> we were copyists from the <HI>Ro∣mans,</HI> who, again, took their instruments from the <HI>Greeks.</HI> Me∣thinks I see the model of a harp in fig. 7. tab. lxxvi. of the supplement of <HI>Montfaucon,</HI> volume iii.; of the <HI>crwth</HI> in Doctor BURNY'S Psalter, tab. v. fig. 4. or his <HI>Etruscan</HI> lyre, fig. 10. and of the pipe, in several simple pipes, before it received from us the addition of the horns, from whence it got the title of <HI>pib-gorn,</HI> and the <HI>English</HI> name of <HI>cornet</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">See figures of the <HI>crwt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> and <HI>pib-gorn</HI> in <HI>Archaeologia,</HI> iii. tab. vii.</NOTE>.</P>

<P><PB N="440" REF="482"/>It must be observed, that players on crwths with three strings, taborers, and pipers, were reckoned among the ignoble performers: they were not allowed to sit down, and had only a penny for their pains.</P>
<P>THE different degrees were comprehended in this list. There were four in the poetical, and five in the musical faculty. The lowest, or more properly what should be called a candidate or probationer, was <HI>Y Dyscybl Yspâs,</HI> or the <HI>lowest disciple,</HI> who was obliged (if a candidate for poetry) to understand the con∣traction or five species of <HI>Englyns,</HI> and to compose them before a <HI>Pencerdd,</HI> who was to declare upon his conscience, that he was endowed with a true poetical genius. After this he com∣menced</P>
<P>DYSCYBL DYSCYBLAIDD, <HI>Discipulus disciplinabilis:</HI> here he becomes a graduate, but must understand twelve of our dif∣ferent metres, and produce specimens of each of his own com∣position, and if in three years time he does not, by his me∣rit, acquire the next degree, he is degraded from this. If he succeeds, he then proceeds to the degree of</P>
<P>DYSCYBL PENCEIRDDIAIDD, or candidate for degree of <HI>Pencerdd,</HI> when he must understand the propriety of expressions, and the different metres, and compose in twenty-one species; and if in three years he does not attain by his own merit to the next de∣gree, he falls back into that of <HI>Dyscybl dyscyblaidd;</HI> otherwise he becomes a</P>
<P>PENBARDD or PENCERDD, chief of the faculty he was can∣didate in; when it is necessary he should be accomplished in every branch of his art. He then received the badge of the
<PB N="441" REF="483"/>
silver-harp; or that of a golden or silver chain, which he wore upon his shoulder. He also was placed with much ceremony on a magnificent chair, part of the <HI>furnyture</HI> mentioned in the pa∣tent; was there invested with his degree, and then acquired the honorable name of <HI>Cadeirfardd,</HI> or <HI>Bardd cadeiriawg.</HI></P>
<P>IN instrumental music there were five degrees; which differ nothing from those in the other faculty, except in the two lowest: I. the <HI>Dyscybl yspas heb râdd,</HI> or without a degree, 2. <HI>Dyscybl yspas graddawl,</HI> or graduated; 3. <HI>Dyscybl dyscyblaidd;</HI> 4. <HI>Dyscybl pen∣ceirddiaidd;</HI> 5. <HI>Pencerdd.</HI> These, like the others, were to be at∣tained by their respective merits in the science; but as then qua∣lifications are expressed in technical terms of <HI>British</HI> music, it is past, my skill to give an explanation. None but a <HI>Pencerdd</HI> should presume to become an instructor. The chief of our days, is that uncommon genius, the blind Mr. JOHN PARRY of RHIWABON, who has had the kingdom for his <HI>Cylch clera,</HI> or musical circuit, and remains unrivalled.</P>
<P>OUR PENCERDDS thus qualified, were licensed to sing, or to perform under certain restrictions. By the law of our princes, particular regard was paid to their morals: <Q>They were to be no make-bates, no vagabonds, no ale-house haunters, no drunkards, no brawllers, no whore-hunters, no theeves, nor companions of such, in which things, if they offend, everie man, by the statute, is made an officer, and authorized to ar∣rest and punish them; yea, and to take from them all that they have about them<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Powel, 192.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="442" REF="484"/>THEY were prohibited from uttering any scandalous words in speech or whispers; detraction, mocking, scoffing, inventing lies, or repeating them after others, under pain of fine and im∣prisonment: nor were they to make a song of any person with∣out his consent; nor to enter any man's house without formal leave first obtained.</P>
<P>EVERY <HI>Penbardd</HI> and <HI>Pencerdd</HI> was allowed to take in dis∣ciples for a certain space of time, but not above one at a time. A disciple was not qualified to make another. Each was to be with his teacher during <HI>Lent,</HI> unless prevented by sickness or imprisonment, under pain of losing his degree. He was obliged to shew every composition to his teacher before it was publicly sung. They were not to follow the practice of <HI>cl̄er y dom,</HI> i. e. dunghill bards and musicians, or any other species of vagabond minstrels. They were enjoined a month before each festival, to settle their routs with their respective teachers, least too many of them should crowd to the same places; only one being al∣lowed to go to a person who paid ten pounds a year rent; and two to such who payed twenty pounds, and so on in proportion to those of higher rank: and every teacher was obliged to keep a copy of these rules, to shew and inculcate to his pupils in time of <HI>Lent,</HI> when they came for their instructions.</P>
<P>No person was to mimic, mock, or scoff at the <HI>awenyddion</HI> on account of their mental absence, or when they had on them the AWEN or <HI>poeticus furor;</HI> from an opinion that no bard, duly authorized, could ever meditate on improper subjects.</P>
<P>To whatsoever house they came in the time of wakes, they must remain there while the feasting lasted; unless they had leave
<PB N="443" REF="485"/>
from the master of the house, or were invited by another. If they wandered from house to house, they were to be apprehended as strollers and vagabonds, and to be deprived of their <HI>clera</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Or their pay. Sometimes it signifies the act of their perambulation.</NOTE>, which was forfeited to the use of the church. If they got in∣toxicated, they forfeited their reward: but if they violated the chastity of wife or maid, they were fined and imprisoned, and lost their <HI>clera</HI> for seven years.</P>
<P>THEIR fees or rewards were regulated. <HI>A dyscybl dyscyblaidd</HI> was entitled to 3 <HI>s.</HI> 4 <HI>d.</HI> for his <HI>cowydd.</HI></P>
<P>A DYSCYBL PENCEIRDDIAIDD, received for the same species of composition 6 <HI>s.</HI> 9 <HI>d.</HI></P>
<P>His teacher, or the <HI>Pencerdd,</HI> had no more; only the master of the house usually presented him with a garment, or some other mark of favor.</P>
<P>THE minstrels received these rewards; a <HI>dyscybl yspas graddawl</HI> had only 1 <HI>s.</HI> upon each of the great festivals.</P>
<P>A DYSCYBL DYSCYBLAIDD, at the same seasons 2 <HI>s.</HI> and a <HI>dyscybl penceirddiaidd</HI> 3 <HI>s.</HI> 4 <HI>d.</HI></P>
<P>A PENCERDD the same, besides a voluntary gratuity. He was also entitled to fees at royal and other weddings; and upon their <HI>cylch clera,</HI> which was permitted only once in three years. But besides these fees, in order to encourage the <HI>clerwyr</HI> to keep up the language and the memory of the exploits and pedigrees of the <HI>Britons,</HI> they were allowed a penny out of every plough∣land, and a halfpenny out of every half ploughland of their district.</P>
<P><PB N="444" REF="486"/>THE <HI>Penbardd</HI> and <HI>Pencerdd,</HI> in their circuits, frequented only the houses of the gentry; but if he degraded himself by visiting the commonalty, he was only to expect the fee of a com∣mon <HI>clerwr,</HI> whose province it was to visit the <HI>plebeian</HI> houses. The following were the persons who were allotted to entertain the vulgar ears.</P>
<P>A PERSON laboring under any infirmity; such as blindness, lameness, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> a <HI>dyscybl yspas,</HI> a <HI>dyscybl dyscyblaidd,</HI> and <HI>dyscybl pen∣ceirddiaidd.</HI> The first regulation was founded on humanity.</P>
<P>No public festivity, great feast, or wedding could be duly solemnized without the presence of the bards and minstrels. A glorious emulation arose among them; and prizes were bestowed on the most worthy. In 1176, the lord <HI>Rhys</HI> prince of <HI>South Wales,</HI> made a great feast<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Powel, 237.</NOTE> at <HI>Christmas,</HI> on account of the finish∣ing his new castle at <HI>Aberteifi;</HI> of which he proclamed notice through all <HI>Britain</HI> a year and a day before; great was the resort of strangers, who were nobly entertained; so that none departed unsatisfied. Among deeds of arms, and variety of <HI>spectacles,</HI> RHYS invited all the bards of <HI>Wales,</HI> and provided <HI>chairs</HI> for them, which were placed in his hall, where they fat and dis∣puted, and sang, to shew their skill in their respective faculties, and bestowed great rewards, and rich gifts on the victors. The bards of <HI>North Wales</HI> won the prizes; but the minstrels of <HI>Rhys</HI>'s houshold, excelled in their faculty. On this occasion the <HI>Brawdwr Llys,</HI> or <HI>judge of the court,</HI> an officer fifth in rank, declared aloud the victor, and received from the bard, for his fee, a mighty
<PB N="445" REF="487"/>
drinking-horn, made of the horn of an ox; a golden ring, and the cushion on which he sat in his chair of dignity<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Leges Wellicae, 28.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE bards of those times often accompanied their voices with the harp, as they were wont of old, in the manner described by <HI>Ammianus Marcellinus</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Lib. xv. 9.</NOTE>. There was also another species of musi∣cian, of an inferior kind, called <HI>Datceiniad,</HI> who accompanied the musical instruments of others with his song. He was infe∣rior to both bard and minstrel; yet it was requisite he should be possessed of a considerable degree of knowledge in both sci∣ences: he ought to be able to tune the harp and <HI>crwth:</HI> to shew his skill in playing several notes and keys, and to be perfectly conversant in what are called the twenty-four measures of instru∣mental song; and to be able to sing with judgment and melody. He was likewise to be master of reading justly, and writing correctly. He was not only to understand the twenty∣four modes of metrical compositions; but to exhibit specimens of his own, at left in three of them; and if he met with any old song faultily transcribed, he was to rectify it. He was also to carry with him a harp or a <HI>crwth</HI> in a white case. He was further required, not only to be a ready waiter at table, but to be an expert carver of every species of fowl. At the weddings of any of the royal family, his office was to wait on the bride.</P>
<P>ON those occasions, I am reminded of another custom in which the bards were concerned. After their nuptial feast, a <HI>Pencerdd</HI> was constituted CYFF CLER, or <HI>pillar of the clêr,</HI> and
<PB N="446" REF="488"/>
seated in a chair surrounded by the other bards standing, who made him the subject of their merry and ludicrous compositions, to raise mirth in the company. He was that day to make no reply; but on the next, he was to divert the hall at the ex∣pence of the inferior bards; and was also to compose a poem upon a subject given him suitable to his dignity.</P>
<P>THE most inferior of the musical tribe was sometimes admit∣ted.<NOTE PLACE="marg">DATCEINIAD.</NOTE> This was the <HI>Datceiniad pen pastwn,</HI> or he that sung to the sound of his club; being ignorant of every other kind of in∣strument. When he was permitted to be introduced, he was obliged to stand in the middle of the hall, and sing his <HI>cowydd</HI> or <HI>awdl,</HI> beating time, and playing the symphony with his <HI>pastwn</HI> or club; but if there was a professor of music present, his leave must be first obtained before he presumed to entertain the company with this species of melody. Wherever he came he must act as a menial servant to the bard or musician<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Several parts of this account are translated from <HI>Cambrobrytannicae Cymra∣ecaeve Linguae Institutiones;</HI> a very rare book, written by Doctor <HI>John Davydd Rhys</HI> of <HI>Llanfaethlu</HI> in <HI>Anglesey,</HI> printed in 1592. He took his doctor's degree at <HI>Sienna;</HI> but was educated at <HI>Oxford.</HI> He returned to his own country, where he practised with great success.

<P>NEAR GADLYS smelting works is a lofty round mount, flat at top.<NOTE PLACE="marg">p. 85. GADLYS.</NOTE> On this had probably been a casteler, the residence of

some of our princes; which gave rise to the name GADLY's <HI>Palatium Castrense.</HI> This may, perhaps, be a better reason than that which I assign; notwithstanding, I believe it to be the spot occupied by <HI>Henry.</HI></P>
<P>THAT <HI>Edward</HI> I.<NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 43.

<P>A REMARKABLE circumstance, which put a stop to much cruelty exercised by ordonnance of parlement against the native <HI>Irish,</HI> who served in <HI>England</HI> in the royal army during the civil wars, happened at this place Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI> in one of his marches across this country, halted at <HI>Ellesmere,</HI> and determined, by retaliation, to revenge the deaths of the <HI>Irish</HI> sufferers; thir∣teen
<PB N="451" REF="493"/>
of that kingdom had lately been executed by the parle∣ment army in cool blood. Here the prince ordered the prisoners whom he had in possession, to cast lots for their lives on the drum-head; and the thirteen on whom the fatal destiny fell, to be hanged. The die was cast, and the unfortunate men se∣lected. While preparation was making for their execution, one of them (<HI>Philip Littleton</HI>) who had been park-keeper to <HI>Robert Corbet</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> of <HI>Stanwardine,</HI> saw Sir <HI>Vincent Corbet</HI> of <HI>Moreton Corbet</HI> ride by, who was in the prince's army. <HI>Littleton</HI> told a soldier, that he was sure if Sir <HI>Vincent</HI> knew he was there, he would intercede for him. The soldier, with great humanity, ran to the knight, and informed him of the case; who immedi∣ately obtained his pardon. The rest were executed, and after this, no more <HI>Irish</HI> were put to death in this kingdom.</P>

It was besieged by general <HI>Mytton,</HI> who placed his can∣non against the new gate, which he soon demolished. A bold and daring young man, named <HI>George Cranage,</HI> went with his hatchet, and cut down the chains of the draw-bridge. The parlement forces then entered, and obliged the royalists to retire into the castle. <HI>Cranage</HI> was then persuaded to hang a <HI>buttar (petard)</HI> at the castle gate. After being well animated with sack, he under∣took this desperate attempt: crept with the engine from house to house, till he got to that next to the castle; fastened it to the gate, set fire to it, and escaped unhurt. The gate was burst open, and the place taken. Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI>'s MSS.</P>

King <HI>William</HI> found it necessary to make use of <HI>Trevor,</HI> who was made first lord commissioner of the great seal, and privy counsellor. He had been speaker of the house of commons in each reign. In that of <HI>William,</HI> he is recorded to have been the first who managed a party by buying of votes, for which purpose he was intrusted with mo∣ney by the court; but in 1694-5, was expelled the house for receiving a bribe of a thousand guineas from the city of <HI>Lon∣don,</HI> in order to expedite the passing of the <HI>Orphan</HI> bill, which had long stuck in the house; and which he ought to have done from the sole motive of justice and compassion.

<P>HE has this year received his manu-mission, and preferring a quiet life to the hazard of embarking in a stormy and tumul∣tuous world, has lately settled himself in a small retreat under my wing.
