<L>Judge well my <HI>ups</HI> and <HI>downs,</HI> my wit and metre,</L>
<L>And swear that Pindar's self was never greater;</L>
<L>But ah! you won't, for none can please like Peter.</L>
<L>In Peter's praise you're louder still and louder,</L>
<L>I fear that rogue has giv'n you all <HI>love-powder.</HI></L>

<L>O say, dread sirs, what <HI>Sop in Pan</HI> will please you;</L>

<L>AH well-a-day!</L>
<L>Ah well-a-day!</L>
<L>What shall I say?</L>
<L>What shall I say?</L>
<L>Ah! in what dictionary shall I find</L>
<L>Meet words to vent the grief that labours in my mind?</L>
<L>O Muse! a hapless brother Bard deplore,</L>
<L>Who's fallen, fallen, fall'n to rise no more.</L>
<L>Mourn all ye friends of Peter and of fun,</L>
<L>Mourn very hard indeed—and when ye've done,</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="5"/>Come listen to my lay,</L>
<L>And mind what I've to say.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now you must know this cock of rhyme</L>
<L>Was hatch'd in some unlucky time.</L>
<L>Some planet of malignant pow'r</L>
<L>Presided o'er his natal hour.</L>
<L>I see, I see</L>
<L>The Fates decree,</L>
<L>Or do or say whate'er we can</L>
<L>To serve this poor unhappy man,</L>
<L>Some dire disaster must attend,</L>
<L>And so he'll come to no good end.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>You know,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide &amp; eme <HI>Sop in the Pan.</HI></NOTE> at Court I got him plac'd,</L>
<L>But now he's ousted and disgrac'd.</L>
<L>Did I not give him good advice,</L>
<L>And that not once, but twice or thrice?</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="6"/>But all advice, I fear, is vain,</L>
<L>The rogue has been at his old tricks again.</L>
<L>Nay, what is worse than all that's past,</L>
<L>He now is held in durance fast;</L>
<L>As you will hear, if you'll attend</L>
<L>The following story to its end.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Scarce had he warm'd himself at Court</L>
<L>Before he fell to wicked sport.</L>
<L>Well fed and cloth'd, he there begun</L>
<L>To play all sorts of wanton fun.</L>
<L>Complaints were brought from ev'ry quarter—</L>
<L>—One while he'd steal a maid of honour's garter,</L>
<L>And by such flatt'ring token prove</L>
<L>How high he stood in maiden's love.</L>
<L>Another while, perdue as dead</L>
<L>He'd couch 'neath maid of honour's bed,</L>
<L>As if intent on nightly wickedness;</L>
<L>But now I'm well assur'd 'twas nothing less.</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="7"/><HI>Bromfield</HI> and <HI>Hawkins</HI> both declare</L>
<L>That he could do no mischief there,</L>
<L>(I mean in maid of honour's bed)</L>
<L>For all his mischief's in his head.</L>
<L>In ambush thus he only lay</L>
<L>To hear what they in sleep would say,</L>
<L>And then forsooth the wag would run</L>
<L>And tell their secrets all in fun.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>On this the maidens all combin'd,</L>
<L>And in petition formal join'd</L>
<L>With loud complaints against our Bard,</L>
<L>Declaring it was very hard</L>
<L>That he their private chambers should invade,</L>
<L>And hear what they in midnight dreaming said;</L>
<L>Such test was far too much for any mortal maid.</L>
<L>Of waking maids, all own, there are great numbers;</L>
<L>But ah! what earthly maid can answer for her slumbers?</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="8"/>But what they most of all things fear'd,</L>
<L>Was, that he'd publish all he heard.</L>
<L>They knew that Peter had a tattling tongue,</L>
<L>Which blabb'd out all, but chief if aught was wrong.</L>
<L>Should he in nightly ambuscade discover</L>
<L>That they, in sleeping fancy only, had a lover,</L>
<L>Of courtly maids, this sland'rous tale</L>
<L>In Peter Pindar's Ode would stand,</L>
<L>And fly forthwith in Palmer's mail</L>
<L>To all the gossips in the land.</L>
<L>In short—if he must be indulg'd in such-like sport,</L>
<L>The sisters, one and all, resolv'd to quit the Court.</L>
<L>The virtuous maidens rueful plaints were heard,</L>
<L>And full of reason and of truth appear'd.</L>
<L>Peter was question'd on these heads</L>
<L>Of maidens garters and their beds,</L>
<L>Was by his master reprimanded,</L>
<L>And to his proper post remanded,</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="9"/>With charge, no more to be so rude</L>
<L>As thus indecently t' intrude,</L>
<L>To gratify a curious whim;</L>
<L>For maids or not, what was't to him?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But not the virtuous maids alone,</L>
<L>His fellow-servants ev'ry one</L>
<L>Complain'd of saucy Peter,</L>
<L>His gibing and his metre.</L>
<L>But chief of all the Laureat-Bard</L>
<L>With reason good averr'd, 'twas hard</L>
<L>That he could never make a Birth-day Song</L>
<L>To 'scape the witty malice of his tongue.</L>
<L>That when he did his very best,</L>
<L>Of all his words, he'd make a jest.</L>
<L>Oft as he form'd a sober rhyme,</L>
<L>Or strove to soar in verse sublime,</L>
<L>The rogue was sure to mock him with another,</L>
<L>And now would call him Tom, and now would call him Brother.</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="10"/>Long had he borne his arch grimace,</L>
<L>But now grew weary of his place.</L>
<L>Rather than be the butt of monkey Peter,</L>
<L>He'd quit the trade, and deal no more in metre.</L>
<L>To fly from such intol'rable attack,</L>
<L>He'd forfeit both his bays, and marks, and sack.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Of chaplains all he'd make a jest,</L>
<L>For Peter never lov'd a priest.</L>
<L>He always was a very wicked boy,</L>
<L>And never would the Sabbath-day employ</L>
<L>In conning over<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The phrase is rather stiff-rump'd, but Peter Pindar must answer for it.</NOTE> <HI>Bible-phrase sublime;</HI></L>
<L>His Sabbaths all were giv'n to fiddling and to rhyme.</L>
<L>His mother told him 'twas a shameful thing</L>
<L>To make such wicked songs about his K—g.</L>
<L>Ah! son, she'd say, 'twill bring thee to the gallows,</L>
<L>As sure as spending Sabbath-day in ale-house.</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="11"/>And as he added year to year,</L>
<L>He more and more alarm'd her fear,</L>
<L>Lest he should take to wicked ways,</L>
<L>And in a halter end his days.—</L>
<L>—But after this digression short,</L>
<L>Let's now resume our thread at Court,</L>
<L>And Peter's farther pranks report.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Bed-chamber lord or page in waiting</L>
<L>Was sure to bear his waggish baiting.</L>
<L>Whoever came to Court</L>
<L>Was Peter's butt and sport.</L>
<L>At ev'ry human ailing,</L>
<L>At ev'ry human failing,</L>
<L>Whether halt, or blind, or lame,</L>
<L>He'd loll his tongue, and make his game.</L>
<L>With hasty speech, and utt'rance quick,</L>
<L>He'd play you ev'ry monkey trick.</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="12"/>'Tis said his r—l master didn't escape</L>
<L>The mimic wagg'ry of this rhyming ape.</L>
<L>At length the courtiers, one and all,</L>
<L>Determin'd to effect his fall.</L>
<L>And yet the question may admit of doubt,</L>
<L>Wheth'r all their efforts could have got him out;</L>
<L>So much his master lov'd him,</L>
<L>Till he a traitor prov'd him.</L>
<L>Now, gentle reader, let us straight repair</L>
<L>To council-hall, and learn what passes there.</L>

<L>My Lords, if my poor feeble voice be heard,</L>
<L>This puzzling point had better be deserr'd,</L>

<L>Meanwhile, my Lords, we may go home and dine,</L>

<L>May take a little private recreatiion,</L>

<L>Done, done,</L>
<L>Nem. con.</L>
<L>Now, gentle reader, should some Lord invite thee,</L>
<L>Perhaps a sumptuous dinner may delight thee;</L>
<L>But if no lordly invitations come,</L>
<L>Then cat thy mutton-chop, and be content at home.</L>
<L>But if nor house nor home be thine,</L>
<L>Nor mutton-chop, nor silver coin,</L>
<L>Alas, thy case is very hard,</L>
<L>Thou'dst better change it with our Bard.</L>
<L>Peter lives well, and at free charge,</L>
<L>Until he's set once more at large;</L>

<L>Unless Lord T—y, right or wrong,</L>

<L>Should grasp him in his arbitrary paw,</L>

<L>From thence our Bard may strait proceed,</L>

<L>What tho' the plot did not succeed,</L>
