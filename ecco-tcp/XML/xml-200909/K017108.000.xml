<P>Who's the Dupe? A FARCE: As it is ACTED at the THEATRE-ROYAL IN
DRURY-LANE.</P>
<P>By Mrs. COWLEY, AUTHOR of the RUNAWAY, a COMEDY.</P>
<P>LONDON: Printed for J. DODSLEY, L. DAVIS, W. OWEN, S. CROW∣DER, T.
LONGMAN, T. CADELL, T. BECKET, and Messrs. CARNAN and NEWBERY.

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE Reader will find Passages in the following Scenes, which
are not spoken on the Stage. Actors of skill and ability, ac∣quainted with
the ideas of the Writer, and assisted by all the advantages of
Stage-repre∣sentation, give impressions of character and situation with
more expedition and certainty than can be done by Words alone; elucida∣tions,
which may be necessary for the Reader, are therefore very frequently and
properly omitted by them.</P>
<P>The Author owes too much to the very excellent manner in which the
Farce is acted, not to seize this opportunity of acknow∣ledging her
obligations to the Performers.</P>
<P>Judging from her own experience, as well as her observation on
that of others, she feels that Authors are so far from having reason to
join in the common clamour on the declension <PB N="4" REF="3"/> of the Stage,
that there has been no period in which performances in the Comic line have been
represented with such uniform strength: and though it is impossible
for her to form distinctions on the merit of so perfect a
repre∣sentation, yet she cannot omit expressing her particular
obligations to Mr. King, for accept∣ing, from the best motives, and in the
most polite and candid manner, a part not perfectly agreeable to himself,
but which owes its effect principally to his performance.</P>

<HEADNOTE>
<P>[The AUTHOR was disappointed of a promised
<HI>Pro∣logue</HI>—The following was sketched the evening pre∣vious to
the representation of the Farce, but not spoken, on account of the length
of the several enter∣tertainments on that night.—It is printed, as an
explanation of the principal idea on which the plot was formed.]</P>
</HEADNOTE>
<LG>
<L>IN days of yore liv'd doughty Knights,</L>
<L>Enchanters, 'Squires, and valiant Wights—</L>
<L>Scamp'ring o'er mountains, seas, and land,</L>
<L>Prompt at their haughty Fair's command.</L>
<L>Castles were raz'd, and Giants kill'd,</L>
<L>Volcanos sunk, or Rivers fill'd:</L>
<L>No Ravisher dar'd stalk the earth;</L>
<L>No faithless Lover turn'd to mirth</L>
<L>The oaths his fondness once had swore—</L>
<L>Is he inconstant?—He's <HI>no more.</HI></L>
<L>Rare times were these! yet some there were</L>
<L>Who even then against the Fair,</L>
<L>Fearless of Conj'rer, 'Squire, or Knight,</L>
<L>Could shew their teeth, and vent their spight.</L>
<L>These were your Learned Men—your <HI>Writers,</HI></L>
<L>Whom no age ever mark'd for Fighters;</L>
<L>But war with <HI>Women</HI> they could wage,</L>
<L>And fill their bold, satyric page</L>
<L>With petty foibles—<HI>Ladies</HI> faults—</L>
<L>Who still endure their rude assaults;</L>
<L>For even now it is the way,</L>
<L>In this our polish'd modern day,</L>
<L>On Female Follies to be witty,</L>
<L>From the Court Beauty to the City.</L>
<L>Those who can't rhyme, in weighty Prose</L>
<L>Their <HI>whims</HI> and <HI>vanity</HI> expose:</L>
<L>In Epigrams Sir Witling's folio</L>
<L>Makes of the sex a perfect olio—</L>
<L>Of noise, caprice, and pride, compos'd,</L>
<L>To ev'ry thing <HI>outré</HI> dispos'd—</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="5"/>Whilst Cards, and Dress, and studied
 Airs,</L>
<L>More than good Housewifery, or Prayers,</L>
<L>Engross their time, their hearts, their cares.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus have they borne, from distant ages,</L>
<L>The lash of Wit, the frown of Sages.—</L>
<L>Sure then 'tis fair <HI>one</HI> hour to give—</L>
<L>'Tis all she asks—a Woman leave</L>
<L>To laugh at those same <HI>learned</HI> Men!</L>
<L>The gall of whose sarcastic pen</L>
<L>By Youth, and Beauty, is supply'd,</L>
<L>Nor spares the Matron, Maid, nor Bride.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>If any from the musty Halls,</L>
<L>Or the chill gloom of College-walls,</L>
<L>To bask in Pleasure's tempting ray,</L>
<L>Have Phaëton-like obtain'd a day,</L>
<L>And, thron'd in yonder circle, sit,</L>
<L>Deciding on the claims of Wit—</L>
<L>Think not that <HI>you,</HI> our Author means,</L>
<L>When thro' her saucy Farcic scenes,</L>
<L>A Pedant she has dar'd to scan</L>
<L>From Alma Mater—spick and span.</L>
<L>No; in her name she bids me swear</L>
<L><HI>You</HI> are chief fav'rites of the Fair—</L>
<L>You've blood and spirits in your veins,</L>
<L>And give—<HI>ge-heup</HI>—to joy the reins;</L>
<L>Skim Life's sweet surface, and pursue</L>
<L>The flying blessings, still in view—</L>
<L>For Pleasure ever on the beat,</L>
<L>And <HI>roasted</HI> SQUARE CAPS—think a treat.</L>

 <STAGE>[Pinching her cheek.]</STAGE></P>

<P>I can't sell them alone—the tree and the roses must
 go together.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><PB N="2" REF="7"/>Enter GRANGER.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sand.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! Granger, by all that's fortunate! I wrote to you last
 night in Devonshire, to hasten your return.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Grang.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then your letter and I jostled each other at two o'clock, on
 this side Hounslow. My damn'd postillion—nodding, I suppose,
 over the charms of some Greasalinda—run against the letter-cart,
 tore off my hind wheel; and I was forced to mount his one-ey'd hack, and, in
 that curious equipage, arrived at three this morning.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sand.</SPEAKER>
<P>But how has the negotiation with your Brother ended? Will he put
 you in a situation to—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Grang.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, to take a sweating with the Gentoos. He'll speak to Sir
 Jacob Jaghire to get me a commission in the East-Indies—<Q REND="inline">"and, you know, every body grows rich
 there—and then you know you're a Soldier, you can fight." 
 <STAGE>[In a tone of mimickry.]</STAGE></Q> </P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sand.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, what answer did you give him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Grang.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Sir Bobby, I can fight 
 <STAGE>[mimicking];</STAGE> but I can't grow rich upon the
 smell of gun∣powder. Your true <HI>East-India</HI> Soldier is a dif∣ferent
 genius from those who strew'd Minden with Frenchmen, and must have as
 great a fe∣cundity of character, as a Dutch Burgomaster. Whilst his sword
 is in his hand, his pen must be in his cockade: he must be as expert at
 Frac∣tions, as at Assaults; to-day mowing down ranks of soft Beings,
 just risen from their Embroidery; to-morrow, selling Pepper and
 Beetle-nut—this hour a Son of Mars, striding over heaps of slain; the
 next, an Auctioneer—knocking down Chintz and Callico to the best
 bidder.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sand.</SPEAKER>
<P>And thus your negotiation ended?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="3" REF="8"/>
<SPEAKER>Grang.</SPEAKER>
<P>Except that I was obliged to listen to some very wise
 dissertation about <HI>running out,</HI> as he calls it. 
 <Q REND="inline">"Five Thousand—enough for any younger
 Son, but the Prodigal." 
 <STAGE>[mimicking]</STAGE></Q> Really, Sandford, I can't see
 how I could help it. Jack Spiller, to be sure, had Nine Hundred. The poor
 fellow was honest; but he married a Fine Lady, so died insolvent. I had a
 few more accidents of the same kind; my Captaincy cost a
 Thousand—and the necessary expences in America, with the
 distresses of my fellow Soldiers, have swallowed the rest.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sand.</SPEAKER>
<P>Poor Granger! So, with a spirit to do honour to Five
 Thousand a year, thou art not worth Five Shillings.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Grang.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>C'est vrai.</HI> Should my affairs with Elizabeth be
 cross'd, I am the most undone Dog on earth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sand.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now, tell me honestly, is it Elizabeth, or the fortune, which
 is your object?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Grang.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why look'ee Sandford! I am not one of those sighing
 Milksops who could live in a cottage on love, or sit contentedly under a
 hedge, and help my wife to knit stockings; but, on the word of a Soldier, I
 had rather marry Elizabeth Doily with Ten Thousand Pounds, than any other
 woman on earth with an Hundred.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sand.</SPEAKER>
<P>And the woman must be very unreason∣able, who would not be
 satisfied with such a distinction. But do you know, that Elizabeth's
 Father has taken the liberty to chuse a Son-in-law without your
 permission?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Grang.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha! a Lover! That then is the secret my Charmer hinted, and
 which brought me so hastily to Town. Who—what is he?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sand.</SPEAKER>
<P>Every thing that you are not.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="4" REF="9"/>
<SPEAKER>Grang.</SPEAKER>
<P>There is such a mixture of jest and earnest—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sand.</SPEAKER>
<P>Upon my soul, 'tis confoundedly serious.—Since they
 became my neighbours in Suffolk, I am in the secrets of the whole family,
 and, for <HI>your</HI> sake, have cultivated an intimacy with Abraham Doiley,
 Citizen and Slop-Seller. In a word, the Father consults me, the Daughter
 complains to me, and the Cousin, fille-de∣chambre, romps with me—Can my
 importance be increased?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Grang.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dear Sandford! 
 <STAGE>[impatiently.</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sand.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dear Granger! the sum total is this: old Doily—bred,
 you know, in a Charity-school—swears he'll have a Man of LARNING for
 his Son. His caprice makes him regardless of fortune; but Elizabeth's
 husband must have Latin at his fingers' ends, and be able to teach his
 Grandsons to sputter in Greek.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Grang.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! I'll study Hebrew, and write Odes in Chaldee, if that will
 content the old Gentleman—but, may I perish, if all the Pedants in
 England, with the Universities to back 'em, shall rob me of my
 Elizabeth!—See here 
 <STAGE>[producing a Letter]</STAGE>—an invitation, from her
 own dear hand.—This morning—this very hour—in a moment I
 shall be at her feet 
 <STAGE>[Going]</STAGE>—Go with me through the
 Park—Oh, no—I cry you mercy—You walk, but I fly.</P>
<STAGE>[Exit.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sand.</SPEAKER>
<P>Propitious be your flight!—Egad! there are two fine
 Girls—I'll try 'em—half afraid—the Women dress so
 equivocally, that one is in danger of attacking a Countess, when one only
 means to address a Nymph of King's-Place.</P>

<P>Yes,

 last night. 
 <STAGE>[Exit Servant]</STAGE> What! I see you are resolved
 for to have poor Gradus's heart, Elizabeth!—I never saw you so
 trick'd out in a morning before. But he is n't none of your Chaps that's to be
 catch'd with a Mountain∣head, nor knots, nor gew-gaws.—No, no; you must
 mind your <HI>P</HI>s and <HI>Q</HI>s with him, I can tell you. And don't laugh
 now when he's with you.—You've a confounded knack at laughing; and
 there's nothing so odious, in the eyes of a wise man, as a great
 laugher.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Doil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! his very idea is as reviving as burnt feathers in
 hysterics.—I wish I had seen him last night, with all the rust
 of Oxford about him! he must have been the greatest provocative to
 mirth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doil.</SPEAKER>
<P>How! what! a provokive to mirth! why, Hussey, he was
 recommended to me by an antikary Doctor of the Royal Society—he has
 finished his Larning some time; and they want him to come and drink and
 hunt in Shropshire—not he—he sticks to Al-mater; and the
 College-heads have been laid together many a time to know whether he shall be
 a great Judge, a larned Physician, or a Civility Doctor.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Doil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay then, Sir—if he's all this, laughing will be
 irresistible.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Doil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don't put me in a passion, Betty—don't go for to put
 me in a passion. What, would you have a Man with an eternal grin upon, his
 face, like the head of a knocker? and hopping and skipping about like a Dutch
 Doll, with quicksilver in its heels? If you must have a Husband of that
 sort, so be it, so be it—you know the rest.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Doil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Surely, Sir, 'tis possible for a Man who does not move as if
 cut in wood, or speak as though he delivered his words by tale, to have
 Breeding, and to—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doil.</SPEAKER>
<P>May be—may be; but your Man of Breeding is not fit for old
 Doiley's Son. What! shall I go for to give the labour of thirty years to a
 young Jackanapes, who'll come into the room with a Dancing-school
 step—and prate of his Grandfather Sir Thomas, his Great-Grand∣father
 the General, and his Great-great-great-Grandfather—merely because I
 can't tell whether I ever had one, or no?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Doil.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope, Sir, that such a Man could never engage my—</P>
</SP>

<P>Pshaw, pshaw! <HI>you</HI> can't pretend for to judge of a

<P>Except Mr. Gradus.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, He! He's very different from your Men of Breeding, I
 assure you—The most ex∣traordinary Youth that was ever turn'd out
 of College. None of your Randans, up all night—not drinking and
 wenching—No—in his room—poring, and reading, and studying.
 Oh, the joy that I shall have in hearing him talk! I do love LARNING. I was
 grieved—grieved to the soul, Betty, when thou wert born. I had set my
 heart upon a Boy—and if thou'd'st been a Boy, <PB N="7" REF="12"/> thou
 shouldst have had Greek, and Algebra, and Jometry enough for an

<P>No, no; don't be sorry—be obedient, and all will be as
 it should be. You know I doat on you, you young Slut. I left Eastcheap for
 Westminster, on purpose to please you. Hav'n't I not carried you to
 Bath, Brimigem, and Warley-Common, and all the genteel places? I never grudge

<P>Perfectly right, Madam, perfectly right. The more simple your

<P>Not read, nor write! Zounds, what a time was that for to bring
 up a Daughter! Why, a Peeress in those days did not cost so much as a
 Barber's Daughter in ours. Miss Friz must have her Dancing, her French, her
 Tambour, her Harpsicholl, her Jography, her Stronomy—whilst her

<P>Aye, to be sure; what's reading good for, but to give a

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Grad.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Lovers of that age, Madam, were ignorant of frothy
 compliments. Instead of be∣ing gallant, they were brave; instead of
 Flattery, they studied Virtue and Wisdom. It was <HI>these,</HI> Madam,
 that nerved the Roman arm; that em∣powered her to drag the nations of the world
 at her chariot-wheels, and that raised her to such an exalted
 height—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Doil.</SPEAKER>
<P>That down she tumbled in the dust—and there I beg
 you'll leave her. Was ever any thing so monstrous! I ask for a
 Compliment, and you begin an Oration—an oration on a par∣cel of stiff
 Warriors, and formal Pedants. Why, Sir, there is not one of these brave,
 wise, god∣like Men, but would appear as ridiculous in a Modern Assembly
 as a Judge in his long wig and a Maccaroni jacket.</P>

<P>What! now you're in the pouts, Sir? 'Tis mighty well. Bless
 us! what a life a Wife must have with such a Being! forever talk∣ing
 sentences, or else in profound silence. No delightful nonsense, no
 sweet trifling—all must be solemn, wise, and grave. Hang me if I

 have all the gravity and coldness of Wisdom, without its impertinence.</P>

 it by in lavender, for your Grandson's christening—and here's
 cambrick enough in your ruffles to make his shirt.</P>

<P>Yes, Madam, still Gradus; but not that stiff, scholastic

<P>Why, doubtless, a little Classical know∣ledge might have

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sand.</SPEAKER>
<P>How so?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, I tended the Common Council, and all the Parish-meetings,
 for fifteen years, without daring for to make one arangue—at last 
 <PB N="30" REF="35"/> a Westry was call'd, about chusing of a Turncock. So,
 now, thinks I, I'll shew 'em what I'm good for—our Alderman was in the
 Purples—so, thinks I, if he tips off, why not I, as well as
 another?—so I'll make a speech about Patrots, and then ax for their

<P>Aye, Sir! but this Youth disappointed all his hopes. Mighty
 pleasant, to see a young Fellow—form'd to possess life in all

<P>Oh, Sir! this Youth has found a dozen mistakes in his
 theories, and proved him wrong in one or two of his calculations—in
 short, he is advised to give the world a system of his own—in
 which, for aught I know, he'll prove the earth to be concave instead of
 spherical, and the moon to be no bigger than a punch-bowl.</P>

 <STAGE>[Pulls in <HI>Gradus</HI> by the arm.]</STAGE> Here, I've
 brought him—one of your own kidney—ha! ha! ha! Now I'll lay a

<P>Here's a blow-up!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, for all he looks so like a Nin∣compoop in this pye-pick'd
 jacket, he's got his noddle full of Greek, and Algebra, and them things. Why,
 Gradus, don't stand aloof, Man—this is a Brother Scholar, I tell
 ye.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Grad.</SPEAKER>
<P>A Scholar! <HI>all</HI> who have earn'd that distinction, are
 my Brethren. <HI>Carissime frater, gaudeo te videre.</HI></P>

<P>Sir—you—I—most obedient. I wish thou wert
 in the bottom of the Red Sea, and the largest folio in thy library about thy
 neck.

<SPEAKER>Sand.</SPEAKER>
<P>For Heaven's sake, Mr. Doiley, what do you mean?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mean! why, I mean for to pit 'em, to be sure—and to give
 Elizabeth to the winner. Touch him up—touch him up!

 is.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sand.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, sure, you won't set them together by the ears!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doil.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no—but I'm resolved for to set 'em together by the
 tongues. To cut the business short—Mr. Gradus! you are, to be
 sure, a great dab at Larning, and what not; but I'll bet my Daughter, and
 Fifty Thousand to boot, that Granger beats ye—and he that wins, shall
 have her.</P>
</SP>

<P>Heavens! what a stake! 'Tis suffi∣cient to inspire a dolt

<P>My dear Friend, think of the inde∣licacy—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Fiddle-de-dee!—I tell you, I will have my whim—and
 so, Gradus, set off. By Jenkins, you'll find it a tough business to
 beat Granger—he's one of your great Genis Men—going to write a
 book about Sir Isaac, and the Moon, and the Devil knows what.</P>
<STAGE>[Miss <HI>Doil.</HI> and <HI>Charl.</HI> enter at the back
 of the stage.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>If so, the more glorious will be my victory. Come, Sir! let us
 enter the lists, since it must be so, for this charming prize 
 <STAGE>[pointing to Miss <HI>Doiley.</HI>]</STAGE> Chuse your
 weapons—Hebrew—Greek—Latin—or English. Name your
 subject; we will pursue it syllogistically, or socratically, as you
 please.</P>

 Socraticisms!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doil.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, I'll not have no English—What a plague! every
 Shoe-black jabbers English—so give us a touch of Greek to set off
 with—Come, Gradus, you begin.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Doil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Undone! undone!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Grad.</SPEAKER>
<P>If it is merely a recitation of Greek that you want, you shall
 be gratified. An epi∣gram that occurs to me, will give you an idea of that
 sublime language.</P>

<P>Yes, Sir. I—I—am not much pre∣pared—I could

<P>Hoity, toity! What, at a stand! Why sure you can talk Greek
 as well as Gradus?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Grang.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis a point <HI>I</HI> cannot decide—<HI>you</HI> must

 Zanthus, I re∣member, in describing such a night as this—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Grad.</SPEAKER>
<P>Zanthus! you surely err. I remem∣ber but one being of that
 name, and he was a Horse.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Grang.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, he was an Orator—and <HI>such</HI> an one that,
 Homer records, the Gods themselves in∣spired him.</P>

<P>True, Sir,—but you wo'n't deny—</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come—come! I sha'n't have no brow-beating—nobody
 offer'd for to contradict you—So begin 
 <STAGE>[to Granger.]</STAGE> What said Orator Zan∣thus?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Grang.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yon lucid orb, in aether pensile, irra∣diates th'expanse.
 Refulgent scintillations, in th'ambient void opake, emit humid splendor.
 Chrysalic spheroids th'horizon vivify—astifarious constellations,
 nocturnal sporades, in refrange∣rated radii, illume our orb terrene.</P>

<P>There! there!—Well spoke, Granger!—Now, Gradus,
 beat that!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Grad.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am enrapt in astonishment! You are imposed on,
 Sir—instead of classical language, you have heard a rant in
 English—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doil.</SPEAKER>
<P>English! Zounds! d'ye take me for a fool? D'ye think I don't
 know my own Mother-tongue!—'Twas no more like English, than I am like
 Whittington's Cat.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Grad.</SPEAKER>
<P>It was every syllable English.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doil.</SPEAKER>
<P>There's impudence!—There was'nt a word of it
 English—If you take that for English, devil take me if I believe
 there was a word of Greek in all your <HI>tri pantrys.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Grad.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! the torture of Ignorance!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ignorant!—Come, come, none of your tricks upon travellers.
 I thought you meant all that as a skit upon my edication—but I'll have
 you to know, Sir, that I'll read the Tenth Chap∣ter of Nehemiah with you for
 your ears.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Grad.</SPEAKER>
<P>I repeat, that you are imposed on. Mr. Sandford, I appeal to
 you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Grang.</SPEAKER>
<P>And I appeal—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sand.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, Gentlemen, Mr. Doiley is your Judge in all disputes
 concerning the Vulgar Tongue.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, to be sure, I am. Who cares for your Peals? I peal too;
 and I tell you, I wo'n't be imposed on. Here, Elizabeth—I have got ye a
 Husband, at last, to my heart's content—</P>

<P>Him, Sir! You presented that Gentleman to me this morning, and

<P>In he! what in that Beau-bookworm! that argufies me down, I

<P>Sir, in obedience to the com∣mands of my <HI>Father</HI>— <STAGE>[significantly.]</STAGE></P>

<P>Sha'n't say Obedience—say something kind to him of

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Doil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then, Sir, without reserve, I ac∣knowledge your choice of Mr.
 Granger is per∣fectly agreeable to mine.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doil.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's my dear Bet!— <STAGE>[kissing her]</STAGE>—We'll have the wedding
 directly. There! d'ye understand <HI>that,</HI> Mr. Tri-Pantry?—is
 <HI>that</HI> English?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Grad.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, so plain, that it has exsuscitated my
 understanding—I perceive I have been dup'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, well! I had rather you should be the Dupe than me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Grad.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Sir, I have no inclination to contest—if the

</SP>
<SP>

<P>Agreed! provided that, in your cha∣racter of Husband, you will
 be as singular and old-fashion'd as the Wig you wore this morn∣ing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doil.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, Cousin! have <HI>you</HI> taken a fancy to the Scholar?
 Egad! you're a cute Girl, and mayhap may be able to make something of him—and I don't care if I throw in a few Hundreds, that you mayn't repent
 your Bargain. Well, now I've settled this affair exactly to my own mind, I am
 the happiest man in the world—And, d'ye hear, Gradus?—I don't
 love for to <PB N="40" REF="45" MS="y"/> bear malice- If you'll trot back to
 College, and larn the difference between Greek and English, why you may
 stand a chance to be Tutor—when they've made me a Grandfather.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Grad.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have had enough of languages. You see I have just engaged
 a Tutor to teach me to read the World; and if I play my part there as well as I
 did at Brazen-Nose, your indulgence will grant me applause.</P>
