<STAGE>MARTIN <HI>and</HI> LUCETTA <HI>meeting.</HI></STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Luc.</SPEAKER>
<P>MR. Martin, good morning! you are abroad very early. Have you alter'd your hour of rising, or are you troubled with a bad conscience?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mart.</SPEAKER>
<P>I make you as early a visit as this is, my dear girl, each morning of my life—in imagi∣nation;—but I now pay my duty to you in per∣son, and by order of my master. He, poor soul! full of anxiety, bad me attend your levée for an account of the health of that sweet swain his uncle, How has he passed the night?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Luc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Never worse.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mart.</SPEAKER>
<P>Heav'n be praised! The old fellow must have had a noble constitution, or he never could have stood buff; at once to so many diseases.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Luc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very true. He has twice within these two days fallen into my arms in a profound lethargy:
<PB N="2" REF="6"/>and, I believe, no earthly care but mine could have revived him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mart.</SPEAKER>
<P>O curse your care! And pray how are you rewarded?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Luc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, I can't say I have either present pay, or good quarters. He seems sensible of my good offices; but begs to be excused the paying for them.—He, indeed, promises faithfully to remem∣ber me in his Will.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mart.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, is he going to make one at last?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Luc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Immediately—where my name, I believe, will make no small figure.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mart.</SPEAKER>
<P>Heav'n send it, say I!—the old fellow must be very rich.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Luc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Rich! so he had need be to satisfy all those who are gaping for his death.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mart.</SPEAKER>
<P>He'll treat them with a mouthful of moonshine. My master flatters himself the best part of the wealth will fall to his lot. I think, I, as a relation, am entitled to a legacy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Luc.</SPEAKER>
<P>A relation! You!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mart.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes I—My master and his uncle are re∣lations, that can't be deny'd.—My late wife was as obliging as she was handsome—indeed we were look'd on as the most agreeable couple in the pa∣rish—but let that pass. She, I say, by a small ex∣ertion of that good nature for which she was re∣markable, took care that my master and I should be kin. O, I'm certainly one of the family.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Luc.</SPEAKER>
<P>At that rate, I believe, you are related to more families than this. O wedlock would be a wealthy state indeed if husbands could inherit by such a title.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mart.</SPEAKER>
<P>True, true—but joking apart—'tis ne∣cessary that we should do every thing in our power to forward this will, get it made, and to our
<PB N="3" REF="7"/>liking too—for if my master should not be remem∣bered by the old gentleman, he must, the rest of his days, take up with very spare diet. But what is most materially to be considered, is the reward of five hundred, which he has promised to give you and me, as secret service money, on the day of his marriage with Myra: and which, to avoid disputes concerning dividends, you have consented shall be common stock, and we are to follow their example. O, here comes my master.—</P>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> SAVILLE.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sav.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, my dear Lucetta, what news? af∣ford me some comfort! How is my poor uncle? How has he passed the night? Can he bear com∣pany? May I be permitted to see him this morn∣ing?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Luc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Really, Sir, he has passed the night very ill; and, if I can form any judgment, he has not a right to expect many more on this side the grave.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sav.</SPEAKER>
<P>Good heav'n! What say you, Lucetta? Notwithstanding my great expectations, duty and nature are very powerful in me; and his approach∣ing end causes certain emotions, which you cannot feel, or I describe.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mart.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot answer for her feelings, or your descriptions; but as to emotions, I believe they are such as I felt when I paid the last duties to my poor dear wife of pious memory. I found myself attacked by a kind of a certain fort of a—flow—pungent—pleasing—melancholy—that had such an effect on my spirits, that—as if—in short, as you say, Sir, it is a situation easier felt than told, and what many a married man wishes to experi∣ence,
<PB N="4" REF="8"/>that he may become a more competent judge.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Luc.</SPEAKER>
<P>—I believe the old gentleman begins to think himself in a bad way at last; for he has or∣dered me to provide two proctors.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sav.</SPEAKER>
<P>My heart throbs to find my fate so near its crisis.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Luc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Be of good cheer, Sir; I believe all will go well: within these two days he and your mi∣stress's mother, Mrs. Watchly, were laying their heads together, and in deep muttering for some time—Deeds—legacies—marriages, and so forth; and I make no doubt the main point was making a conditional match for you and the young lady.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sav.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don't flatter me, Lucetta. Heaven is my witness, I should not think wealth worth a wish, did it not shorten the journey of my desires to my dear Myra.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Luc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come, come, Sir, you are in a fair way of having both—Nay, I make no doubt of your being sole heir.—Troth 'twould grieve me to see the stock divided: for, Sir, I know you would do a world of good with it.—Now, as to your pro∣mise to Martin and me, I know—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sav.</SPEAKER>
<P>Say no more of that, Lucetta: I remem∣ber my promise, and will be even better than my word.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Luc.</SPEAKER>
<P>O, Sir, I don't doubt your generosity: and I hope I may venture to say, I shall not be al∣together unworthy. I have always kept praising you and your good qualities to the old gentleman. —Lord, Sir, says I, how happy are you in such a nephew! so sweet a disposition! so complaisant! so respectful! not urged to attend you, like most of your relations, from a principle of selfishness, but by a regard of the most delicate and tender nature.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="5" REF="9"/>
<SPEAKER>Mart.</SPEAKER>
<P>You hear, Sir, how well she knows and describes you—to say the truth, Sir, I think you can no more over-rate <HI>her</HI> merit, than she can over∣praise <HI>yours.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sav.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think her desert is great—and I'll tell you what else I think—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mart.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, Sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sav.</SPEAKER>
<P>That you are not quite disinterested in your recommendation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mart.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why the truth is, Sir, the poor girl has cast a favourable eye on the person and good qua∣lities of your humble servant, and I have con∣sented to follow your example. I'm sure, Sir, you can't blame me for taking pity on her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Luc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pity, Sauce-box! pity!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mart.</SPEAKER>
<P>O, that dissembled anger becomes you mightily. You see, Sir, she has her attractions; she's young, handsome, <HI>en bon point;</HI> and—I had better not be too lavish neither, lest he shou'd take a fancy to her too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Luc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hush! I hear the old gentleman. You have detain'd me so long here, I shan't be able to go to the Proctors. Run you, Martin, directly, and tell them to come hither; they both live in Doctor's Commons; one is named Caveat, the other Item.—go.—</P>

<P>Ah, Nephew! good-morrow!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sav.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear Sir, how do you find yourself? sit down, Sir—Lucetta, draw forward the arm-chair, that my uncle may be more at his ease.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ling.</SPEAKER>
<P>So—so—so— <STAGE>(sits down)</STAGE></P>

<SP>
<PB N="6" REF="10"/>
<SPEAKER>Sav.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think, Sir, you look much better than when I saw you last—But, Sir, I really think you don't do yourself justice; your frame must be much weaken'd by your disorder, and you neglect the proper applications to restore it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ling.</SPEAKER>
<P>They are not to be had, nephew, without a considerable expence. Those props for the constitution are very dear; and I think the building so crazy, 'tis hardly worth repairing— But, dear Charles, I'm glad you call'd; for I have some thoughts of settling my small worldly matters—Have you sent for the Proctors?</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>(to Lucetta)</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Luc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Sir; and expect them here very soon.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ling.</SPEAKER>
<P>My good Charles, I shall take care of thee.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>I have no cause to doubt it, Sir.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ling.</SPEAKER>
<P>You know that I have relations, that— euh, euh— <STAGE>(coughs)</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Luc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, in troth, a hopeful pack, and a com∣fortable number.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ling.</SPEAKER>
<P>Who watch my door as eagerly as the undertaker.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sav.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope my uncle knows me too well to put me in the list.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Luc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Heaven be praised! I shall see the harpies fitted for their avarice. Such a crew! hungry as wolves, and cunning as foxes. O, what raising of shoulders, and dropping of jaws there will be, whenever the will's produc'd, and the long ex∣pected ticket proves a blank. Never stir, Sir, but I think it wou'd be worth a trip from the other world to behold their disappointment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ling.</SPEAKER>
<P>May be so, Lucetta—But as I am not got there yet, I need not at present think about making the experiment. However I'll put my
<PB N="7" REF="11"/>affairs in order, and have sent for the Proctors to take my instructions.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Luc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, you act as a prudent man ought—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ling.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nephew, you have now and then seen our neighbour, Mrs. Watchly?</P>

<SPEAKER>Ling.</SPEAKER>
<P>And her daughter, Myra,—euh, euh—you have seen her too?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sav.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Sir; and have been much pleas'd with her ease, affability, and amiable manners.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ling.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very amiable! I am glad, Charles, we think so near alike—for—I am going to marry her.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Wat.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. Linger, your most obedient. How are you, Sir? I did not expect, after what I heard this morning, to find you so well. We were alarmed with a report that you had had a bad night, and were given over.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ling.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, Madam, those reports are spread by my vile relations, who speak as they wish.—I was never better.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>I think, Madam, my uncle's countenance is a confirmation of it: he really looks like a man of thirty.</P>

<P>Yes, in a coffin.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Wat.</SPEAKER>
<P>You see, my dear Myra, the man I have fix'd on as your future husband; and I am convinced you are too well acquainted with your duty, to dispute my pleasure.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Myra.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is true, Madam, my duty urges a con∣sent; but believe me, my compliance can answer no other end than to convince the gentleman of
<PB N="9" REF="13"/>his mistake and make me unhappy.—He will find, upon a short trial, my eyes will not have the won∣derful effect his present partiality ascribes to them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sav.</SPEAKER>
<P>That, Madam, must be according as they are applied. I dare say, when rightly used, they have a very healing quality.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ling.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah, well said, Charles! I believe I shall prove the truth of what you say; and in a few months give occasion for a report that will not be so pleasing to my hungry relations—as—Euh, euh! <STAGE>(coughs.)</STAGE></P>

<STAGE>(To Myra)</STAGE>
<P>Lord, Madam, how melan∣choly you look! you don't seem in the least to be sensible of your felicity—why, you'll be the envy of your sex—Pin-money for the present! a fine jointure in future! a charming equipage! a hand∣some man! a parcel of sweet babes! and the curses of all your husband's relations—I know no happi∣ness like it.</P>

<SPEAKER>Ling.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thank you, Lucetta, thank you!</P>

<P>I can't bear this impertinence. Why, Sir, <STAGE>(to Linger)</STAGE> they are laughing both at you and me.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ling.</SPEAKER>
<P>Laughing at us!—who is it, my sweet Myra, that dares to laugh at us? What, is it you, nephew?—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sav.</SPEAKER>
<P>Heaven forbid, Sir—I was never more se∣rious than I am at present. Were I in your place I would do just the same. Warm passions require a wife, and a good estate wants an heir; the young lady's mother gives her consent, and I would marry the sweet, young, amiable creature directly.— <STAGE>(looking tenderly at Myra)</STAGE></P>

<P>Why, I think, if the wedding takes place, Mrs. Watchly will be a cruel avaritious je∣zabel; that e'er long the old man will be heartily tir'd, and Miss heartily mortified—that you will run distracted; these put together will make up a bad piece of news for your creditors, and I shall run away, which I may say without vanity, Sir, will be a very severe stroke upon you.</P>

<SPEAKER>Luc.</SPEAKER>
<P>The best in the world. I think your uncle grows worse and worse; and his wishes for the match seem to give way with his health. I did as you desired with Miss Myra.—I am con∣vinced all the old lady's rhetoric will be thrown away—this I have told the old gentleman, not omitting a few aggravating circumstances which invention supplied me with, and he as good as says he has no hopes.—Now if we can but— <STAGE>(bell rings)</STAGE> Hark, his bell rings—I'll go to him, and make the best use of my time, ay, and my tongue too—Courage, Sir, we shall come through at last never fear. <STAGE>(bell rings.)</STAGE> So, so, so.</P>

<P>Huzza! things begin to look as they should do. Farewel expectation and welcome re∣gular meals. Ah, my dear Sir, we shall yet be made men. Exit penury, enter generosity. The cash will tumble into proper hands—consent will follow cash, and matrimony follow consent. My good fortune depends on your marriage, and my marriage on your good fortune. You will—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sav.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hold, hold! not quite so fast! you seem to be reckoning without your host. I will, how∣ever, run and acquaint my dear Myra with the present posture of affairs, and try what I can do with the old lady.—Do you stay in the way to usher in the proctors; and if any thing extraordi∣nary happens, you know where to find me. <STAGE>(going.)</STAGE></P>

<P>Dead, Sir. The moment I got into his room, I saw every token of life forsaking him— he just muttered something, that he wished for the proctors, that he would now leave you sole heir.

<P>I can't say—My Lord has a great deal of understanding and but little money; the lady's friends a great deal of money, and a very small share either of right or understanding—so—but as I have told you the situation of both parties, I dare say, Brother Item, we may both guess how it will end.</P>

<P>Sir yours—pray how is good Mr. Linger?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sav.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Sir, in a very disagreeable situation and I fear near his end.—When he sent to you we had very little expectation of his living till you came—but he has taken a little nap since, and seems tolerably refresh'd. He is preparing to re∣ceive you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Caveat.</SPEAKER>
<P>See, Sir, how contrary to his intentions things might have ended.—A man who has any thing to leave, should not defer settling his affairs till the last moment. Some idle people will tell you, that a man may often change his mind as to the disposal of his property. So let him, so let him—he can also change the form of his will as often; and might I advise, a man of fortune should rather make ten wills a month, than live a month after he's of age without one.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sav.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, my uncle, without hearing your opi∣nion seems conscious of his error, and wants to do all in his power to prevent the inconveniencies you seem to apprehend from his neglect. He is wholly unable to bear much light or talk—therefore I must beg you will put up with as little of one, and provoke as little of the other, as the nature of the case will admit. Come, gentlemen, I'll shew you the way.</P>

<P>Gentlemen, I'm glad you are here and in health; I really don't envy you, though I can∣not

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Caveat.</SPEAKER>
<P>Courage, my good Sir; a man is not a bit nearer death for making his will; nay, I affirm the very contrary.—Nothing so likely to give re∣pose as easing the mind; nothing so likely to ease the mind, as settling one's worldly affairs; nothing so absolute a settlement of worldly affairs as a well made will—ergo—a well made will is the likeliest medicine to re-establish health.—</P>

<P>I am sorry you are displeased, Sir. But we can set it all to rights. The will is not yet executed. When the proctors return you may dismiss them—or let me execute it, and afterwards put it in the fire, and let matters stand as your good uncle left them.</P>

<STAGE>(Aside.)</STAGE>
<P>The arch rascal has me secure on every side. Well, Martin, I've done!—you
<PB N="21" REF="25"/>shall have your annuity; but you must deserve it by some further assiduity in the affair: I cannot leave the house, and as it will be some time before the proctors can finish their business, you must, to answer present occasions, put yourself in statu quo; then send the boy to Mrs. Watchly. Let him tell her and my dear Myra I am impatient to see them, and beg they will pay me a visit here. He must say, my uncle is confined to his room, so they will run no hazard of seeing him.</P>

<P>After all, I cannot reconcile myself to the having been a party in executing this decep∣tion; 'tis true my uncle promised to leave all to me, in preference to every other relation. But tho' he had an undoubted right so to give it, I have by no means a privilege thus to take it—I will, however, so far make use of the fraud, as to blind Mrs. Watchly; and when Myra and I are settled, I make no doubt of gaining her pardon for the deceit, and liberty to make satisfaction to all parties.—</P>

<P>I owe him fifty pounds! I never had an accompt with him in my life.—</P>

<P>How, Mr. Caveat! Two hundred a year? Why this could not—</P>

<P>No, as you say, Sir, this could not be in your lethargy.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ling.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lethargy or no lethargy, I am glad the will was not executed. I desire, Mr. Caveat, it may be immediately burnt. I would not have such a testimony of my folly in being. Two hun∣dred a year!—O burn it, burn it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mart.</SPEAKER>
<P>Burn it, mercy forbid, Sir! Destroy all my hopes at once! Consider how kind providence has been in restoring you, and don't begin your new life in an ill humour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ling.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear Charles, there is nothing convinces me of the reality of this will, but my having taken
<PB N="28" REF="32"/>notice of thee in it; nor indeed is there any thing which prevents my confirming it, but the sums mentioned to be left to thy injury in favour of these two—who, however deserving—</P>

<P>Wough!—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ling.</SPEAKER>
<P>How!—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sav.</SPEAKER>
<P>We have deceived both you and the law∣yers. This fellow, mischievous and selfish, taking the advantage of your supposed death, took upon him to counterfeit you, and dictated that wicked absurd will which you have heard.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ling.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am in a cold sweat!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mart.</SPEAKER>
<P>And I in a colder!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sav.</SPEAKER>
<P>My offences are greater than his—for I, who ought to have had feeling and honour to for∣bid the deceit, hurry'd on by the Devil, interest, and that passion Love (for Myra's charms had
<PB N="29" REF="33"/>bewitched me) gave way to the temptation, and now stand before you, with the most keen, con∣trite feeling of my offence, but without the least hope of your forgiveness.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ling.</SPEAKER>
<P>But you shall have hope; for I do, and will forgive thee. 'Twas my abominable prepo∣sterous love that drove thee to despair.—I see, I confess, my errors, and will attone for them im∣mediately. Call Lucetta, call the proctors, call every body.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mart.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lucetta! Proctors! Every body.—</P>

<SPEAKER>Ling.</SPEAKER>
<P>O, Mr. Caveat, I am too full of joy to talk about my will now—But send me a blank li∣cence; come to me in the evening, and I will sa∣tisfy you all.
<STAGE>[Exit Proctors.</STAGE> Nephew, run this moment to Mrs. Watchly and her daughter Myra; bring them to me directly!— Lucetta! do you and Martin get all the assistance you can, and procure me a wedding feast in a hurry. If I don't see you married, nephew, be∣fore I die, I shan't die in peace; and that I may die in peace, I must see you wedded and bedded directly. Ah Martin, you have been a great rogue to be sure, but I forgive you, I'm in a humour now to forgive every body.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sav.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, Sir, it is more than he deserves; but after the indulgence shewn to me, I think I must forgive him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mart.</SPEAKER>
<P>Forgive me! is that all?—so the best of my situation is likely to be that of wearing this
<PB N="30" REF="34"/>livery during pleasure;—a vile exchange for two hundred a year and my wife's portion!—I am now oblig'd to return to the comb and the cloath brush —tho' tis hardly a minute ago that my head was full of nothing but lands, tenements and provision for younger children,—however I ought not to complain, 'tis a proper punishment for my eager desire of growing rich too soon;—but—courage! give me thy hand, Lucetta!—I am not yet afraid to follow my master in matrimony; and will hence∣forward endeavour to imitate him in every virtue.</P>
<L>We see in him integrity rewarded,</L>
<L>While scheming Martin's very near discarded:</L>
<L>In future plans contracted be our views,</L>
<L>The proverb says—who covet all—all lose.</L>
