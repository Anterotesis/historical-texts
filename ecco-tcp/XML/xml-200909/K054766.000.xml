<HEAD>TO HIS SERENE HIGHNESS THE MARGRAVE OF BRANDEBOURG, ANSPACH,
AND BAREITH.</HEAD>
<P>CUSTOM has long given a Preface to every book that has been
published—It is likewise accompanied with a Dedicati∣on. I have
always thought the last made the first unnecessary—Indeed both
may <PB N="4" REF="4"/> be dispensed with, if an author does not think his
stile requires an apology for offering to the Public a work, which his
humility or justice may lead him to think fit only to put his readers to
sleep—The greatest part of the public has my permission to doze
over the following sheets, as I expose them to the malice of my enemies,
without reserve, merely to oblige many of my friends; who, know∣ing I had
taken a long and extraordi∣nary journey, have desired me to give them some
account of it. The best I could give, and in the most agreeable manner to
myself, was by transcribing part of my letters to you—in which,
though in a cursory manner, I have gi∣ven you a faithful picture of what I
have seen. Beside curiosity, my friends <PB N="5" REF="5"/> will in
these Letters see at least for some time where the real Lady Craven has
been, and where she is to be found—it having been a practice for some
years past, for a Birmingham coin of myself to pass in most of the inns
in France, Switzerland, and England, for the wife of my husband—My arms
and coronet sometimes support∣ing, in some measure, this insolent
de∣ception; by which, probably, I may have been seen to behave very
improperly. I think it my duty to aver upon my ho∣nour, that it has frequently
happened to me, travelling with my sweet child, to find a landlady, who has
shewn a parti∣cular desire of serving me in the most menial offices,
with tears in her eyes, and upon my asking the reason, in the ho∣nest
indignation of her heart, she said, <PB N="6" REF="6"/> she had been
imposed upon, at such a time, by a traveller who called herself by my
name. If I had possessed the inva∣luable blessing of having you for
my real brother—this curious and unheard of treason to my birth and
character would long since have been punished in the person who could
only countenance the deceit. But let me thank Heaven that I have found in you,
Sir, all the virtues which I could desire in a <HI>brother,</HI> and that
affection and respect which leads me to dedicate these Letters to you. My
actions in future will prove more than this feeble tribute, how deeply
im∣pressed I am with all the feelings of es∣teem that can fill a grateful
heart; your people, Sir, your many virtues, that make <PB N="7" REF="7"/> all
that approach you happy, will justify my dedicating my studious, as my
social hours to you—</P>

<P>THE honour you do me, in wishing to hear from me, deserves in
return a greater entertainment than my letters can afford; and if it was not
for the precious name of sister, which you order me to take, I should 
<PB N="2" REF="10"/> perhaps be a long time before I could ven∣ture to write to
you; but when you com∣mand me to look upon you as my brother, the idea
coincides so perfectly with the es∣teem and friendship I feel for you,
that I obey with pleasure—</P>
<P>Since your Highness left Paris, I have had my brother and
sister here; the south of France has entirely recovered her, and she is
in a fair way of producing an heir—I have many nephews, but none of that
name yet —</P>
<P>I shall set out to-morrow for Touraine, called by the French
<HI>le Jardin de la France;</HI> and at three o'clock in the morning, as it is
very hot—My harp is in the coach with me; for though my intention is not
to stay above three weeks where I am going to—I cannot be so long
absent from the sound of an instrument that I prefer to every other.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="11"/> I have sent you some English
garden-seeds which were given me by Lady —. I hope when you are eating
your sallads this summer, you will think of your adopted Sister, and
believe that it must be very good reasons, that deter her from vi∣siting

<HEAD>LETTER II.</HEAD>
<P>I SLEPT at Orleans last night—and as the weather is
extremely hot, I rested in the middle of the day at Blois, where I examined
the Royal <HI>Chateau,</HI> a house com∣posed of different orders of
architecture, built at different periods of time, and by various persons. The
most modern ad∣dition has been made by Gaston Duc d'Or∣leans, who chose
to place an Italian struc∣ture in the midst of the various irregu∣larity
belonging to the ancient Gothic, one part of which was built by Francis the
First—The ornaments of this (seve∣ral of them) were to me as
incompre∣hensible as Egyptian hieroglyphics would have been. I wished my
friend Mr. W. at my elbow, whose knowledge in, and taste for the Gothic,
might have explained them. The porter who conducted me <PB N="5" REF="13"/>
about, seemed a good historian for a per∣son of his condition. I need not
tell you, how many extraordinary personages and events this <HI>Chateau</HI>
called to my mind. If the confusion which ambition naturally creates in
history, should at this moment prevent your memory from placing them before
you—I refer you to the <HI>Nouveau Voyage de la France, par Mr. Piganiol
de la Force,</HI> who gives a cursory account of Blois, and this
Chateau—but he does not say, what I can assert, that so many
per∣sons have scraped the stone on which Henry Duc de Guise's blood
fell, that there remains but one half of it. My old conductor told me those
who preserved the powder as a relick, were people related to the Guise
family, and curious travel∣lers—I was not one of them. This let∣ter would
be too long if I inserted an ad∣venture which happened to me at the post
beyond Blois. You shall have it in my next. I will only add to this, that if
ever you go from Blois to Tours, do not go by night—the road is on a
causeway, the Loire on your left, and a precipice into <PB N="6" REF="14"/>
meadows on your right, without any fence to prevent an accident, if your
postillions were drunk, or your horses frightened.</P>
<P>The uncommon dryness of the season prevented my judging of the
much boasted beauties of the Loire, which is now re∣duced to the narrowest
rivulet I have seen—There are many castles on the banks which
ornament the landscape—and were probably fortified, in former days; one
in particular put me in mind of dear B. Castle. I suppose they are left
now, as most habi∣tations in France are (distant from Ver∣sailles) for a
<HI>Concierge</HI> to keep his pigs and chickens in—Adieu—</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="3" TYPE="letter">

<HEAD>LETTER III.</HEAD>
<P>AT the post beyond Blois, while the horses were changing, (an
operation not performed in one minute as in England) one of my servants came
up to the door and said, <HI>ces maudits postillons ne veulent point
laisser monter cet enfant derriere la voi∣ture.</HI> The word
<HI>enfant</HI> always strikes to my heart: among the many reasons I had
before, I have now an additional one for feeling about an <HI>enfant</HI> of
any sort.</P>
<P>I am at this moment above a hundred miles distant from the most
affectionate, the most engaging, and the most beautiful child that ever
mother had—and for the first time I have ever left him —</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="16"/> QUEL ENFANT? says I, looking out on the left
towards the hind wheel of my <HI>Berline</HI>—I saw a boy, seemingly
about ten years old, decently dressed in mourn∣ing—a crape round his
hat, and black buckles in his shoes.</P>
<P><HI>Madame;</HI> says he—and the tears in his eyes stopped
his voice—</P>
<P><HI>Eh bien, mon enfant; parlez—</HI></P>
<P><HI>Madame, le Maitre de poste à Blois m'a
conseillé de monter derriere votre Berline, comme il n'y avait point
de malle—à présent les postillons ne veulent pas m'y
laisser—</HI></P>
<P><HI>Comment vous appellez vouz?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Cassius.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Cassius—voila un beau nom; oui, Madame,</HI> said
the child; who had never heard or read of any other Cassius but
himself—<HI>mon pere était géntilhomme,—</HI>and he
gave me a pocket-book which contains letters. One of these was from a lady of
quality to the child's distant relations at la Rochelle, de∣siring them to
place him on board a ship.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="17"/> <HI>Comment,</HI> says I; <HI>wous voudriez
ser∣vir</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Servir</HI> in French conversation
always means serve in a military capacity, and not as a
servant—</NOTE>.—</P>
<P><HI>Oui, Madame; je ne saurais étre domestique, parce que
mes peres étaient gentilhommes,</HI>—and among a variety of
questions which I asked him—and to which he answered modestly and
pertinently—whenever he recollected that circumstance, it was a painful
idea. He had a brother and sister at Paris, who had sent him to go from
thence to la Ro∣chelle on foot, with six livres, and his let∣ters of
recommendation, for his support and protection. What unfeeling people!
<HI>Avez vous diné aujourd' hui?</HI> It was then about six
o'clock.</P>
<P><HI>Oui, Madame, le maitre de poste à Blois m'a
donné à diner—ce sont les postillons d'ici qui ne
veulent pas que je monte derriere votre voiture.</HI> The postillions by this
time were listening to my conversation with the child, and one of them with
a gruff voice said—<HI>si ce petit monsieur veut payer un cinquieme
cheval, il</HI> <PB N="10" REF="18"/> <HI>montera.—Et si j'avais une
grande malle, comme de coûtume?</HI> says I. <HI>Montez, montez mon
enfant,</HI> and turning to the postillion, <HI>vous aurez de quoi boire
à sa santé;</HI> so he was pleased, and the boy
delighted; but as in France more than in any other country in the world, the
value of every thing is—<Q REND="inline">"So much money as 'twill bring;"</Q>—my maid
was surprized at my <HI>bonté d'ame.</HI>—As I never eat but
once a day in travelling, and that at the end of my journey—I shall
never forget my supper last night—I had got into my bed fatigued, and
ordered my maid to bring me a soup. I had lain half an hour; the room was
dark; and when the door opened, the first thing I saw was Cassius
holding two wax-lights, preceding my maid. He said, Mademoiselle might go
to her supper, and he would wait upon me, and his countenance had a mixture
of comfort, joy, and gratitude in it, scarcely to be seen but in the
candour of youth. This morning I had settled with the mis∣tress of the
inn that she should agree with a waggoner to take Cassius safe to
Ro∣chelle—I had given him some money (too <PB N="11" REF="19"/> little
for charity to name—perhaps what the avaricious would think too much) and
a recommendation signed with my name, and my seal upon it, when the
postillions I had ordered to take me to—came to in∣form me, that, as it
was a cross-country road, they expected three times the sum usually
paid—As I might just as effec∣tually argue with a horse as with a
French postillion, I asked where the post-house was?</P>
<P>Only two doors off.</P>
<P>I went there; the master was out, but his wife was at home; and
while I was settling matters with her, one of the old fashioned French
post-chaises stopt at the door, with an officer in it, seemingly
ema∣ciated by sickness, and his head wrapp'd up very
much.—Cassius was at my el∣bow: <HI>Madame, Madame,</HI> says he,
<HI>ce mon∣sieur n'a point de malle,</HI> (in fact all the lug∣gage was
before;) <HI>Jirais bien plus vite à la Rochelle, si vous vouliez lui
demander de me laisser monter sur sa voiture.</HI>—I went up to 
<PB N="12" REF="20"/> the chaise, and curtsied very low; the officer bowed
slightly; I stept back; but Cassius pulled me by the
sleeve,—so I once again advanced and
curtsied—<HI>Monsieur—</HI></P>
<P><HI>Madame—</HI></P>
<P>I brought Cassius forward—<HI>Voici un pauvre orphelin qui
va à la Rochelle—Il est venu depuis Blois sur ma Berline; si
vous voulez bien lui permettre de monter derriere votre voiture ce sera moi
qui vous en aurai Pobligation—Moi—</HI>I repeated in a higher tone
of voice. The officer had be∣gun by staring at me from head to foot; and
before I had finished my speech he en∣deavoured, but in vain, to draw off
his night-cap—<HI>Tout ce que vous ordonnez—tout ce qu'il vous
plaira, Madame—</HI></P>
<P>And I had the satisfaction of seeing the little orphan
comfortably seated, and fly∣ing towards la Rochelle, certain that he would
neither be robbed nor beaten on the road—</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="21"/> I am setting out for * * * from whence I will
write you an account of any thing I shall observe worthy of being

<HEAD>LETTER IV.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>—EN TOURAINE, 
<DATE>June 21, 1785.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>MY approach to this place was through bad cross-country roads. I
have seen no∣thing yet that could justify the idea of this province being
<HI>le Jardin de la France.</HI> I saw many <HI>chateaux,</HI> which from the
singular towers, their only ornaments, my fancy might have represented
heralds, giants, or dwarfs, issuing forth to enquire what be∣wildered
heroine came so near—<HI>mais hélas</HI>—I did not see
one <HI>preux chevalier,</HI> nor any thing about these ancient structures
that could make me imagine they belonged to gentlemen, much less to noble
warriors—Besides I was gravely seated in a comfort∣able coach,
varnished and gilt, instead of be∣ing on a white palfrey. To be serious,
I am probably writing in a room once in∣habited <PB N="15" REF="23"/> by one of
<HI>Marguerite Reine de Na∣varre's</HI> ladies of honour; for this chateau was
built by Francis the First for his sister. The outside is neither
regular nor beautiful, and I cannot guess what order of archi∣tecture was
intended to be shewn in the building—One front is towards the river
Cher, flanked by two large round towers with spiral tops, and the ground
floor, towards the court, is at least four stories high from the meadows in
which the Cher runs; this suite of apartments was probably royal, the rooms
remarkably lofty and well pro∣portioned—I am told the
<HI>proprietaire</HI> had laid out four thousand pounds to repair the house
and beautify the gardens—As to the first, it is in the same state
most country-houses in France are—wanting painting, white-washing,
and repairs of every sort—The ornaments in the garden are these: many
canals small enough to look like troughs—and statues made in
plaister, all mutilated; the little that remains of them made me wish they
had never existed—Part of the castle-ditch remains, and under it are
cellars and subterraneous passages of an <PB N="16" REF="24"/> enormous
size and length—In this part of the country, the peasant's habitation
is chiefly hewn in the rock, the door being the only wooden part of it; the
labourers catch agues and fevers frequently, by re∣turning home warm, and
resting in these damp cells. From my windows I could see the Loire if at
its usual height, and I have the prospect of a <HI>Chateau</HI> where the
heiress of <HI>Bretagne</HI> gave with her hand that pro∣vince to
France.—In a few days I shall go to Tours, from whence I shall again
write, and assure you how much I am your af∣fectionate
<HI>sister</HI>—</P>

<P>I GALLOPED all the way here on horseback, along a delightful
meadow, and got off my horse at the bottom of the <HI>Mail,</HI> a very fine
walk shaded by some venerable elms, which, by some strange pro∣digy,
have escaped the <HI>cizeau</HI> of the <HI>tondeur</HI>—and spread
their majestic branches much to the comfort of the <HI>Bourgeoifie</HI> of
Tours, who here find a cool <HI>promenade.</HI> But I am told they are soon
to be cut down. <HI>Ils sont trop vieux</HI>—If Mr. d'Eclusel, the
late <HI>intendant,</HI> was alive, he would oppose this horrid scheme; for
as he had lived in England some months, and had sense enough to adopt
what was good with us, he has given this town a clean appearance by adding
<HI>trottoirs</HI> on each side of the new streets—I am lodged at the
archiepiscopal palace. <HI>Monseigneur</HI> is not here, which 
<PB N="18" REF="26"/> I regret—I am told he is a man of let∣ters—of
taste I am sure he is, by a chapel he has just added to his
palace.—There is a large cathedral close to it, the out∣side
Gothic—the stone-work is worth see∣ing—nothing in the inside
but what is very <HI>mediocre.</HI></P>
<P>Another large church here, de St. Mar∣tin<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The king is chanoine de St. Martin—a very singular
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>rcumstance—In the
cloister is a most beautiful frize, done by the masterly hand of Michael
Angelo.</NOTE>, is so nearly connected with our St. Martin's in the Fields in
London, that the Tours clergy were obliged to send to London to get some
ancient charter explained—There are many English here —</P>

<POSTSCRIPT>
<P>P. S. I recollect that you may not know what I mean by the
<HI>cizeau</HI> of the <HI>tondeur;</HI> to explain which I must inform you,
that <PB N="19" REF="27"/> shearing the trees in a French garden is a custom
as ancient, and thought as necessary, as shaving the beard; and
<HI>tondeurs</HI> are paid for it by the year, as barbers are by the month. I
have had several reasons given to me for this Gothic custom; among the
rest, that it made a tree grow more beautiful and strong; which last
excuse must no longer be mentioned, naturalists having discovered
lately, that a tree draws as much nourish∣ment from the fluid received by the
leaves, as from the root itself, — But nature may plead in vain her
cause for centuries to come in France, she will long go
disguised—The gardens and the poetry exhibit melancholy proofs of
this truth, without my mentioning any more at pre∣sent.</P>

<P>I HAVE been to see Veret, a house of the Duc d' Aguillon's,
where there is nothing worth looking at, and <HI>Richelieu,</HI> where not only
the palace but the town was built by the Cardinal of that name—I rode to
a village called <HI>Lillebouchar,</HI> lost my way, and rambled above thirty
miles over the country, before I could find out the <HI>Cure</HI>'s house I
was going to dine with. He is a good sort of a map, sensible and learned,
and had assembled all the good company in the neighbourhood to dine under a
large tent in the garden with me—I must not forget to tell you that I
passed close by the church from whence Joan of Are took her invincible
sword, placed there by Divine Power. Lillebouchar is only two leagues from
Richelieu; where at the first gate of the avaunt-cour two old guards, with
clothes <PB N="21" REF="29"/> as ancient as their faces, their bayonets on their
shoulders, precede the company to the inner court. Here the concierge shews
first, statues of the Roman emperors and heroes, tolerable copies. The
chapel is next shewn, where there is a picture that pleased me much, and
which is said to have been painted by Michael Angelo—I take it to be a
copy—It is spoiling for want of care—and I was told most of the
good pictures were sent to Paris. I was led through many rooms—the
palace is immensely large. One apartment was called the Queen's<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">For the Queen's apartment, and all the rooms, accord∣ing to their
destinations, are shewn.</NOTE>—It was the Car∣dinal's first
intention to bring the whole court to Richelieu—Every beam of wood was
shewn in the cielings of those times—Here they are almost all
carved and gilt over—judge of the expence. There is a whole-length
picture of the Cardinal, by an Italian master, and a good one. After being
walked over the house, large enough to tire a very able walker, I was offered
<PB N="22" REF="30"/> to see the <HI>Jardins;</HI> but from the windows I had
perceived the taste of them, and therefore declined that pleasure—I
ima∣gine the reason why the Cardinal prevented the court from ever coming to
Richelieu, was the same policy that he introduced, and that exist even now,
of drawing all the rich nobles from the seats of their
an∣cestors—involving them in all the ex∣pences of the court at
Versailles, that they might not feel they had a protection in their
home—but look for that, and sup∣port likewise, from royal favour
alone—A cunning idea of making the nobles sup∣port him in his
measures, and particularly if he acted contrary to the good of his
country.</P>
<P>The nobles of my country may thank heaven, when they reflect that
they are members of a great nation, enjoying their ancient seats, and
expecting honours and emoluments from the court as they may deserve them from
their country.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="31"/> The French noblesse, at present, indeed
have a comfort under the weight of debts their fathers may have left
them—they have a young monarch, generous and just—and I really
believe one of the best kings that ever existed. As his power is
great—if the nobles deserve—he will bestow greatly—</P>

claiming him—but I took upon me to say I believed Scot∣land might
boast of being his native land, and that of most of his

earlier period, most of us old English would be found to be Danes, Normans,

<P>I AM safely arrived here, and to avoid going round some leagues
I came a cross-country road; look on your post-map for Cormery, Loches,
Buxancely, Chateau∣roux, Ardante, la Chatre, Montmarau-Culan, Roanne—But,
dear Sir, follow me only on paper; for the roads in some places were so
bad, and the lanes so narrow, that my coach is scratched—and the
drivers, with difficulty persuaded to go to the places I ordered them,
sometimes lost their way. I went through great part of the
Bourbonnais—and within ten miles of Vichy, where the king's aunts were
taking the waters. The Auvergne mountains were fine objects to the right. On my
approach∣ing Lyons, I felt a great difference in the air—A warmer climate
was easily to be <PB N="26" REF="34"/> perceived—The small conic
winding hills, round which the country girls with their strange straw hats,
and their distaff at their side, were conducting their goats as they
spun, formed a landscape new to me—particularly as the flat roofs to
the cottages gave a lightness to the buildings that pleased me
much—</P>
<P>A simple kind of plough likewise, drawn by two oxen, brought
that period to my mind, when the Romans were conquering towns, or founding
colonies—The even∣ing coming on, with a stormy sky, made me almost
fancy that a Roman legion was here and there concealed by the rocks, which
crown almost every one of the conic hills I have before mentioned, and which
might serve as small batteries; nay the very clouds, which I often saw
resting between the hills, might have served for momentary concealment.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="35"/> But we will step out of these clouds if you
please—for I am neither a Roman general nor a goddess, but at this

the junction of the Soane and the Rhone, but on the 17th I saw the paintings
in the <HI>Hotel de Ville,</HI> mostly by Blanchet: his works are spoiling
under the cold hands of neglect and time—The Taurobolum may be very fine,
and much to be admired by all lovers of antiquity; but I, who cannot admire
what I do not think beautiful, looked at it with great indifference—Spon
and other writers give a learned ac∣count of this, and of the brass-plate on
which is engraved the speech made by Claudius in favour of the town, and
which is lest within the reach of mischievous boys or idle beggars. The
people of Lyons seem to pay a greater regard to the vanity 
<PB N="29" REF="37"/> of the moderns than to the pride of the ancients. I saw
a beautiful sarcophagus in a lawyer's court-yard that served as a
cistern—and, in many old walls and houses, carvings or inscriptions
which I wished to examine, while the tradesmen within these habitations
siared at the strangers, who could be more anxious about ruins than the new
silks or embroidery they wished to sell. I cannot help thinking any
anti∣quary might find many more things well worthy of the cabinet of the
curious here than have already been discovered. As to the town's being
handsome, which I was told it was, I must assert that many parts of it
are positively frightful; that the houses are crouded together; each
story, as it rises, projecting over the other—and the streets, as
narrow and stinking as those of Paris; but the environs are beautiful, and
it is extremely amusing to go in a boat every way out of the town—I
took seve∣ral sketches from different points, one from a little island,
which was formerly called Insula Barbara. You recollect a large round 
<PB N="30" REF="38"/> tower which crowns the prison of Pierre∣encise. The
proportions of it struck my ideas of symmetry very much—and after
looking at it for some time, I landed at the foot of the prison, and walked
up a hun∣dred and twenty steps cut in the rock: the guards let me in very
civilly, and, to my utter surprise, among the prisoners I found the
— whom you must remember, as he was very often with — He asked
me a thousand questions about J—, and laughed very much in talk∣ing
over several parties with him and —; but I laughed on my part at his
taking Mr. — for Lord B—.</P>
<P>I had been told Pierre-encise was a state prison, but it is no
such thing: it serves as a temporary retreat for people of fashion who
live too fast—and are placed there by Lettres de cachet, till it
pleases the kind parents who have obtained them to release 
<PB N="31" REF="39"/> their prisoners. — de∣clares, whenever he obtains
his liberty, he shall revisit England, which I suppose at this time,
more than at any other, seems to him a paradise, as there is no such
thing as a Lettre de cachet there—</P>
<P>Do you recollect a most charming picture by Rubens, in the
chapelle <HI>des Penitents?</HI> I examined it a long time with great
de∣light—And did you ever observe that all the fine pictures in France
are spoiling, but those possessed by the church? Indeed know∣ledge
and taste are chiefly confined to the clergy—all other <HI>etats</HI>
in France not having leisure to form their taste; of which truth I must
give a most ridiculous example—Every body last year, that would be
quite <HI>à l' Anglaise</HI> at Paris, had to wait on them, what they
called a <HI>Jakay,</HI> a little boy with straight, lank, unpowdered hair,
wearing a round hat—and this groom-like looking thing waited upon them at
dinner, and was frequently stuck up with three tall footmen behind a fine
gilt coach—It was in vain for me to assert to some 
<PB N="32" REF="40"/> grave old French people that jockey meant riding-groom in
a running-horse stable, and that no grooms ever waited upon us, nay
scarcely ever came into the house, and certainly nothing but servants, as
well dressed and powdered as the French, waited upon us, or went behind our
carriages. They answered, it must then be a new fashion, for it was
<HI>tout-à-fait à l' Anglaise—et comme on fesait
à Londres—</HI></P>

<P>THE fine prospect I was promised from the tower was immensely
so indeed—Landscapes so various, and objects so vast and
innumerable, that the eye seeks in vain for a resting place—I do not
know, dear Sir, if you are of my opinion; but I like that my sight as well as
my mind should be collected, to enjoy one pleasing subject at a
time—Vary the scene as often as you please—but I hate
confusion so much, that if I was obliged to choose a house, situated
on an eminence, commanding a large city, many windings of a river, and an
immense tract of coun∣try, or one at the bottom of that eminence, with a view
so confined that I could see only to the end of a small garden, I think I
should prefer the latter—I know this may seem very stupid, but I
never <PB N="34" REF="42"/> could comprehend the pleasure of what is usually
called a fine prospect, where it is only with a telescope that the
wanderings of the sight are to be fixed—</P>
<P>I have hired a boat to take me down the Rhone to Avignon; it is only
a few planks nailed together that brought wood from Savoy, a sort of raft,
but looks quite strong enough to contain me and my small re∣tinue. I send
my horse by the <HI>coche d'eau</HI>—Do not suppose that my love
for the ancients has totally made me over∣look the modern artists here; a
Lyonnais merchant, whom I bought silks of in Lon∣don, has shewn me all the
new silks and patterns. An ill taste prevails universally as to dress
in France; the last new designs for waistcoats, particularly, are
frightful great sprawling butterflies—the very man who was shewing
them shrugged up his shoulders:</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="43"/><HI> Que voulez vouz, Madame? Il faut tou∣jours
du nouveau—</HI></P>
<P>There is a curious mill to wind silk on bobbins here; a horse in
a garret on the fourth story turns one wheel which sets several on all
the other floors in motion, and those turn many thousand bobbins.</P>
<P>Every ancient building here is stuck upon a rock; and I cannot
help thinking they look like teeth, the rocks serving as roots to
them.—I was assured the Saone ran in a different channel from what it
now does, and that it was the Swiss who had cut through the rocks to give the
river its present course—but if it ever was turned, I should think
it was done by the Romans, whose works, great and useful, stamped their
date—The remains, that testify how much they did in the environs of
this place, may fairly excuse my supposition—if Cali∣gula's 
<PB N="36" REF="44"/> successor could now peep out of his grave—or
Nero, who re-established this town—they might have some difficulty
in believing it was the same—</P>

<P>NOTHING can be more delightful than my last method of travelling
by water. I have had high and contrary winds; but the Rhone's famed rapidity
that I had heard so much of, was neither surprising nor
ter∣rifying—the shores on each side were rocks interspersed with
vine-yards and castles—I landed the first day at Condrieux, where I
bought some excellent wine for 25 sols a bottle, the growth of that
place—About a league from thence is la Montagne Tupain, belonging to Mr.
de la Condamine, where the best Côte-rotie wine is to be had; that word
signifies really and truly roasted-coast, the grapes being almost
broiled by the sun. The wine is of a red and strong kind—reckoned
very fine; but like many other fine things, I did not relish it,—A
little <PB N="38" REF="46"/> farther on the left is l'Hermitage, a spot so
called because formerly a hermit lived upon that hill, the wine of which is
too much known for me to say any thing about it. I gave three livres a bottle
for it, but found the white so much better than the red that I ordered some
to be sent to Mar∣seilles, from whence I shall have it shipped for
England.</P>
<P>There is a small town called Vienne, that has a fine Gothic
cathedral, which I went on shore to look at, together with a monument
belonging to the Montmorin family, well executed.</P>
<P>I saw several people on the banks of the Rhone sifting gravel;
they find among it little bits of solid gold, washed down from the
mountains; a most horrid em∣ployment in this hot weather I should think;
but what will not poor mortals do for gold, since the rich are often slaves
to that which they ought to be masters of —</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="47"/> Montelimart is a castle from whence I am told
three kingdoms are seen, and se∣ven provinces. I did not stop to see
this or any other of the many castles I passed by.</P>
<P>At the Pont St. Esprit, which is a noble bridge indeed, I think
the passage might be dangerous, if the boatmen were not very
attentive.—My coach is so large, and has such excellent blinds, that
I have not suffered from the heat at all—The shores lose all their
beauty near Avig∣non, which I could not see, because it is surrounded by
a high turreted wall.—</P>
<P>Madame de Brancas, the Duc de Cril∣lon's sister, was very civil
to me, and we talked about — I dined with Lord —, whose health is
much impaired, and I hope this cli∣mate will do him good.—Adieu, dear

<P>DEAR Sir, I thought it unnecessary to give you any description
of Avignon, because you have been there, but as you did not take the same
road to it as I did in coming from it, I will endeavour to give you some
faint idea of a natural curiosity that I have seen, and which pleased me
highly—the much famed Fontaine de Vau∣cluse.—</P>
<P>I set out from Avignon in the middle of the day, and arrived at a
town called Lille, where I took a French post chaise, and went in it by the
side of the Sorgue's clear stream, till the road was too narrow for the
carriage to proceed; I then walked in a narrow path winding <PB N="42" REF="50"/> round the immense rocky mountains to the left, with the stream
rapidly flying by me to the right about a mile, till a ca∣vern, pretty much in
the shape of those which lions come out of in an opera, pre∣sented
itself to my view, and from that flows the river. I am told it is an
unfathom∣able abyss. Why it is called a <HI>Fontaine,</HI> I am at a loss
to guess.</P>
<P>Monstrous rocks rise over and on each side of this craggy
arch; these seem to bend forward to meet or crush the
cu∣rious.—Which ever way I turned my eyes, I saw gigantic and
fantastic shapes, which nature seems to have placed there to
as∣tonish the gazer with a mixture of the me∣lancholy, terrible, and
cheerful; for the clearness and rapidity of the river make it a lively
object, and where there is a flat place on the banks, though not above a few
feet in circumference, the peasants have planted trees or sowed
gardens—you lift up your eyes, and see the most perfect contrasts
to them—the birds, which hovered towards the upper part of the 
<PB N="43" REF="51"/> rocks, were scarcely perceptible. In look∣ing into the
cavern, it appears horrible and gloomy; I could almost have fancied the river
ran thus fast, rejoiced to quit the mansion from whence it sprung. No
won∣der Petrarch's song was plaintive, if he courted his muse with this
scene perpetually before his eyes; Love and all his laughing train must fly
the human imagination, where nature displays her features in the majestic
and terrible stile, and I was very glad to find so good an excuse as this
situation for Petrarch's eternal complaint—till now I was puzzled to
guess, how a man of his sense could pass the greatest part of his
life in eternizing a lady's contempt of a faithful passion—but I now
believe there was no Laura—or if there existed one, he found in either
case his imagination parti∣cularly turned to poetry, and that of the
melancholy kind, in this, probably his summer's residence. I, who you know
—, and have as playful a muse as ever smiled upon mortal, sat
examining the astonishing picture before me with a silent reverential
sort of admiration— <PB N="44" REF="52"/> and should have remained
there till night, if I had not been informed that it grew very late, and I
must see the pictures of Petrarch and Laura in the Chateau of the Marquis
de Chamont, which is a miser∣able house a few steps from the
<HI>Fontaine.</HI> These pictures are very modern—probably as like you
as the persons they were drawn for.—I returned to Lille, and eat
craw∣fish and trout, the most excellent that I ever tasted, which abound
in the Sorgue—I passed through Aix, to come to this place; I did not
stop, as I expected a letter at Marseilles, the contents of which
interested me very much: for —</P>
<P>I saw many plantations of canes, which I wonder we do not
cultivate in our water-meadows in England—and I bought very excellent
melons out of the fields for five sols a piece.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="53"/> A country flowing with wine and oil, and where
figs and melons are to be gathered on each side of the public road, may be a
very fine thing; but a want of verdure and fine trees gives it a most
uncomfortable and ungentlemanlike ap∣pearance. When I compared England and the
scene before me together, I could al∣most have fancied I had the
<HI>maladie du pays</HI> upon me—so much did I wish to see a green
carpet under my feet, and some of our beautiful foliage over my
head—</P>
<P>Adieu, dear Sir; how often I wish to be with you I leave the
justice of your heart to determine. I remain yours most
affectionately—</P>
<CLOSER><POSTSCRIPT>
<P>P. S. I forgot to tell you, that while I was changing horses at
Lille, I talked to Captain B—, a sailor, who lives with his wife and
two children in that neigh∣bourhood—He very civilly invited me to pass
the evening at his house, talked about my brother G—, and informed 
<PB N="46" REF="54"/> me that the source of the Sorgue was at this time
remarkably low; and I found by the marks the torrent had left on the rocks when
at its height, that it must be at least forty feet lower now than when it
takes its winter-course: as I saw it, it creeps humbly from the cavern
under part of the rock, and becomes rapid as it finds its level and forms a
river; whereas, when it is in all its glory, it tumbles over the rock a wild
cascade, which must add con∣siderably to its terrific beauties
—</P>
<P>I was informed by the inhabitants of Vaucluse, that people, who
are tired of life, fling themselves into the cavern, where, as I told you
before, the water is unfathomable; upon this information, I asked if bodies
were often found there; I was answered in the affirmative, and that they were
chiefly the bodies of priests—Adieu—</P>

<P>I HAVE examined the rocks just out of this harbour, and think
some of them most fortunately situated to defend the port, but what
surprised me much, was being assured by the boatmen who row me out
twice a day (to get a breath of air) that, at all times of the night, boats are

—</P>
<P>People of all nations, that fili every day the great walk leading to
the quay, made me think on my arrival that some impor∣tant event had drawn
all the people from the houses and the ships together—but a
repetition of the same scene soon convinced me of my mistake. There are
two very <PB N="48" REF="56"/> fine pictures, painted by Puget, represent∣ing
some of the horrid scenes at the time of the plague at Marseilles; they
are only too well executed; I saw several dying figures taking leave of
their friends and looking their last anxious kind and wishful prayer on
their sick infants, that made the tears flow down my cheeks—I was told
the physicians and noblemen who were as∣sisting the sick and dying
were all portraits. I can easily conceive it, for in some of the faces
there is a look of reflexion and con∣cern which could only be drawn from the
life—</P>
<P>I have spoke to Captain —, who com∣mands the King-Fisher;
he is obliged to perform quarantine here, though he had already done his duty

<P>I STOPPED in my way here at Toulon, and intended to look at the
dock-yards, but was refused, which surprised me very much, as an
English lady of my acquain∣tance was suffered to go into them at the time
of the last war with France, when her husband and all the gentlemen with
her were sent out of the town—I could get no other reason
assigned for the refusal, but this—that since Lord — had
seen them, nothing of <HI>English blood</HI> should ever be permitted to
go into them. So I walked about, and all I could see was that the finest
ports in the world, and ships worthy of being commanded by our admirals, will
never make (at least for a great while to come) good sailors of the
French—my rea∣sons I will tell you, when we meet. —</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="59"/> Mr. de S—, who refuses to let any
English person see the dock-yards at Toulon, expressed a great
dislike to our nation, saying he had reason; you will laugh when I tell
you, that his reason for hating us is, that in the late war two thirds of his
squadron were taken, with the greatest part of his convoy, destined for
the East-Indies, and had he not bravely ran away himself, he would
certainly have fallen a prey to those <HI>opiniatres, feroces matelots</HI>
as he calls our sailors—</P>
<P>The gentleman who waited upon Sou∣langes to ask permission and
plead my cause, wishing to recollect what defence Mr. de Soulange's
squadron had made, asked an officer in the room the name of the French
ships, which the poor Mr. de Soulanges so bitterly lamented, he answered
he should recollect them if he heard their names, but could not exactly
remember—</P>
<P>My friend asked if it was—the Ville de Paris, le
Glorieux—le Centaur—l'Ar∣tois—le
Caton—l'Argonaut—le Jason—<PB N="52" REF="60"/> le
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>rothee—le Solitaire—le
Pegase—here the gentleman stared at him, and said, le Pegase was
one of them—</P>
<P>Soulanges said, yes, but the Foudroyant that took her was one of
the largest ships in our navy, and commanded by that <HI>feroce
matelot</HI> Captain Jervais, who would attack the devil, if he met him at
sea; but, added he, Jervais could not have taken the <HI>Pegase,</HI>
unless assisted by other ships—</P>
<P>My friend told him, the Foudroyant was a two decker and carried only
six more guns than the Pegase, and was taken in the war before the last,
by the English ship the Monmouth, commanded by Captain Gardiner, that
carried but 64 guns—that, though he had not the plea∣sure of being
personally known to Captain Jervais, from his public character he was sure
he would do his best in time of war to burn, sink, or take the devil, if
under French colours—He had a great incli∣nation to have told Mr. de
Soulanges what is very well known, that Captain Jervais took the Pegase after
an action of little <PB N="53" REF="61"/> more than half an hour, without any
help whatsoever, but his commands to a gal∣lant crew—and that the other
sail of the line under Soulange's command struck to the Queen, Captain
Maitland, after re∣ceiving a single broadside; but he thought a repetition
of naval actions, fairly stated, might be painful to many officers who were
present, and who paid the tribute due to our navy, in expressing the
highest esteem for it; and so took his leave.</P>
<P>The <HI>Pegase</HI> in question is the very ship my brother
commanded last war. I have often been told that she could not sail, by
the French—but I always assured them, that she has profited so
much by the trim he gave her, that she goes now perfectly well—</P>
<P>They have also talked much of the im∣provement made in their
marine the last war; but unless it is in the cloathing their ships'
company, I cannot find out in what—Old English officers have told me,
they always found their hearts lay in the <PB N="54" REF="62"/> same place as
heretofore—and that when∣ever they could sail fast enough to get
along side of the enemy, the business was pre∣sently settled—I
think I need no better proof of this assertion than one, which I hope may
stand unaltered in the book of Fame for centuries to come; it is
this—our marine is in part composed of line-of-battle ships taken
from our enemies; whereas there exists not a power upon the face of the globe
that can boast of having in their marine one ship of the line taken from
the British nation—</P>
<P>I do not doubt but that the <HI>Ministre de la marine de
France,</HI> and French officers, are excellent naval officers in
theory—but when that is to be put in practice, I hope events will prove,
that we remember we have no other ramparts to defend our coun∣try and our
liberties but the ocean, and that we ever were, are, and must be, a race of
<HI>feroces, opiniatres, matelots</HI>—You say amen to this wish, I
am sure—so remain yours most affectionately.</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="63"/> I think the drive from Marseilles to Toulon
is beautiful—the rocks are as stu∣pendous and nearly as fantastic as
those about Vaucluse, and for some miles they are covered with fir
trees—</P>
<P>You may form some idea of the magni∣tude of the hills and rocks by
my protest∣ing, that the trees and a few cottages which adorn them, look, the
first like tooth-picks, and the latter like the smallest Dutch
toys—the road winds round most gracefully; wherever there was a little
valley, I saw large flocks of goats—As I came nearer to Toulon, I began
to see many orange and pomegranate trees in the gardens; and the caper, which
is a pretty but stinking creeper, grows wild, wherever it is permitted to
take root—</P>
<P>From Toulon to Hyeres I was gradually apprised of the charming
situation of the latter place, by the approach to it, which grew more and
more lovely every step I took—The hedges on the road are com∣posed of
myrtle, pomegranate, and wild <PB N="56" REF="64"/> vine; I passed by
several neat-looking white houses, the gardens of which are full of large
orange trees.</P>
<P>The town of Hyeres is about a league from the sea, placed on the
side of a hill. I shall wait patiently here for that letter I expected at
Marseilles—This happy spot is refreshed by sea-breezes—and
from the elegant cheerfulness which reigns here, it might almost tempt one
to devote many months to solitude and study.</P>

narrow road, forms a landscape worthy of a great master's pencil—On
looking towards the land, mountains on every side, whose tops are decorated
with firs and rocks alternately, and towards the bottom, with olive, orange,
and fig trees, form a beautiful circle, seemingly intended by nature to
prevent the sea from extend∣ing any farther—At a little distance,
in∣land, rises the hill, on the side of which is built the town of Hyeres:
above the town are seen rocks and remains of the ancient town and

<P>DEAR Sir! I am extremely surprised that invalids, who fly to the
south in winter, do not choose Hyeres in pre∣ference to Montpellier or
Nice; it is true that it is more solitary than either of these places; but
I am sure, by the ac∣counts I have had of the last, its lying,
gossiping, mischievous stile of the society must be a most horrid
thing for nerves sha∣ken by illness. There is an uncommon clearness in
the air here; the islands ap∣pear to the eye to be not above three miles
distant, and I am assured they are seven leagues—Provisions are
excellent here, par∣ticularly fish; among these, the John-dory and the red
Mullet are of an amazing size, and excellent; I thought the Dory was called
the Dorade, but it is called the Poisson de St. <PB N="74" REF="82"/>
Pierre; and the Dorade, of which there is plenty, is a very indifferent
fish—They spoil the red Mullet by constantly pulling out the
livers. The land is too precious here to be spared for building, yet there
are houses enough to lodge se∣veral families—</P>
<P>There is very seldom any rain at Hyeres, and the rides of the
environs are the most beautiful that your imagination can
form—particularly one towards the residence of a Mr. Glapiere de St.
Tropés—who has near his house a beautiful large valley between
the mountains, which he might with little expence turn into a charming park
with a river running through it—You most not suppose from the want
of rain here, that there is no verdure, or that the orange-gardens look burnt
by the sun; the natives of this happy spot are extremely in∣genious in
turning every little spring that comes from the mountains (and these
springs are numerous) over their fields and gardens, so that the constant
want of rain here is <PB N="75" REF="83"/> the very reason why every
vegetation ne∣ver fails of being refreshed perpetually.—</P>
<P>Put all these circumstances together, with another, which I
think must weigh with every reasonable person, out of their own country,
which is, that provisions are very cheap, and you will agree with me, that
Hyeres is a very good place for an invalid to pass a winter in.—</P>
<P>I am setting out for Antibes, having re∣ceived the information I
waited for —</P>

<P>MOST part of the road from Hyeres to this place is very mountainous
and nar∣row, so I rode along the greatest part of it—</P>
<P>I find here an ancient work of the Ro∣mans; it is an aqueduct which
a Colonel d'Aquillon imagined might be restored to its former use of
bringing water to the town, at a small expence; he met with much
op∣position and ingratitude from the very peo∣ple to whom it could be of
use; but I am told he has obtained a pension, and a mo∣nument is intended
to be erected to his honour—I believe there is no nation but ours that
waits for a person's death, to shew some sign of
satisfaction—for the benefit derived from their superior talents
—</P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="85"/> If Vauban's plan had been followed for this
port, it would have been one of the finest in the Mediterranean—As it
is at present, none but vessels of the lightest burthen can
enter—</P>
<P>I have hired a felucca, a long narrow boat with three
shoulder-of-mutton-sails, and ten oars, in which I mean to go from hence to
Leghorn—I have talked so much lately to you about orange-gardens, that
you may fairly suppose, I passed much of my time in them; but indeed I
have not, for they are far from being comfortable things to be in, though
magnificent to look at, from a little distance; there is one, and not a very
large garden, at Hyeres, that brings the proprietor in fifteen hundred pounds
sterling a year; I was taken to see it upon my arrival—but the ground
is so precious in these gardens, that none is to be spared for
walks—so that I was forced to creep among the orange-trees as I could,
like any other earthly reptile—</P>
<P>The Spaniards and Algerines having late∣ly made a peace, I am
informed I run <PB N="78" REF="86"/> some risk of being taken by a Barbary
corsair, as the Algerines turn their spirit of piracy on all other
vessels but Spanish at present—however I cannot say I am the
least afraid, since the very fears of my Italian sailors will prevent
them from going farther from the shore than what is abso∣lutely
necessary for sailing—</P>

being ancient and irregular; he has taken most of the fine pictures to Paris,
as his people told me, and I was shewn a modern cornish in stucco, one of
Adam's designs, executing as a great curiosity, though it was none to me,
as we have such in most of our parlours in England—There are the
remains of some fine painting <HI>eu fresque</HI> in the court—The
room the poor Duke of York died in is one of the most melancho∣ly I ever

and dismal—The prince has three <PB N="80" REF="88"/> houses for his
own residence, at a small distance from each other, on this
coast—Monaco, Moncobron, and Menton—His possessions do
not seem very fertile, from whence probably arises an Italian distich my
boatmen repeated so often in going up to Monaco, that I could not avoid
retaining it; in English it is—Monaco upon a rock, neither sows nor
reaps, but lives on others property—They added, that part of his revenue
consisted in a tribute which all small vessels pay in going from
France to Italy, that is, all but the French, who are exempt from this tax,
which, by the bye, I saw no other method of exacting but a mi∣serable
little vessel of his I saw in the port, which they told me went after the
others, who might refuse to pay it—</P>
<P>There were arms and ammunition for forty thousand men sent in
there, by small quantities at a time, for fifteen months past—from
France—</P>
<P>Monaco's Prince, from his connection with French families, and his
frequenting <PB N="81" REF="89"/> Versailles, is become, I suppose (though
a sovereign prince) only a tool of that court—These private military
preparations are conveniently placed for Italy, Monaco be∣ing within
four-and-twenty hours sail of any Italian port north of Leghorn. Here I found
the great use of my new travelling bed—the feet, which are of iron, are
placed in tin cups full of water, and a zinzalière, or gauze curtain
with no opening to it, that lets down over me, prevented my be∣ing devoured by
gnats and every other sort of biting, stinging vermin—</P>
<P>I can conceive nothing pleasanter than having a clean comfortable
English yatcht, with four or five sensible people to go with into Italy,
coasting as I do—The scenery is beautiful—Nice, which I
passed by, is a fine object; the sky too is so clear, every thing
seems to conspire in making this voyage de∣lightful—but, alas! in a
felucca, it is too true, what the late Lord D— said, that you never
come out of one, without feeling all alive. As soon as the heat of the sun
goes off, with the approach of the even∣ing, <PB N="82" REF="90"/> these
Italian sailors make a horrid noise too; they sing, it is true, not
unharmoni∣ously; but for two hours, nay more, the same bymn to the
Virgin—now and then interspersed with a lively ballad—so that
the still part of the evening, which at sea parti∣cularly invites to
contemplation or conver∣sation, is ruffled by the gaiety of these poor
fellows.—I am at present in a very good inn, the Golden Stag—and
every thing I see here is so unlike any thing I ever saw before, that I
am at the window gaping like a country-miss, that is in London for the
first time in her life—</P>
<P>When I have gaped to some purpose, you shall profit by it

<OPENER><DATELINE>GENOA, 
<DATE>Sept. 16, 1785.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>THIS town is oddly situated—it is so much confined between
the sea and high mountains; the churches, convents, and their gardens, take
up so much room, that mercantile people can scarcely find habi∣tations; the
palaces are extremely fine, but so lofty, and the streets so narrow, that
to see the outside of the houses, I think one should lie down in the
middle of a street—I never saw any thing more truly magnifi∣cent than
some of the palaces, the pillars and staircases of which are all
marble—You may judge of the solidity of these buildings: some of
them are seven and eight hundred years old—I saw one stair∣case,
the altering of which cost twenty thousand pounds. It is well worth any
per∣son's <PB N="84" REF="92"/> while to come here who loves fine
pic∣tures—in most of the palaces there are some—a few of the
palaces have large col∣lections; and in these printed catalogues of
them—I have had the greatest pleasure in looking at
some—there are two Vandykes in one of the Brignoli palaces, that I
think invaluable. The man is on a grey horse, the lady his wife, is a whole
length—there is as much grace and beauty in her face and figure, as his
pencil could express—</P>
<P>All the magnificence of the Genoese is confined to their palaces;
by their laws, they cannot have gold either on their clothes, carriages, or
liveries. The chief amusement of ladies here is walking the streets in the
evening, with their sedan∣chair and several servants behind them,
ac∣companied by one or more gentlemen—it is very much the fashion
likewise, for every person who can afford it, to have one or several
country-houses—as they call them; but the situations of them, perched
about the steep rocks, gives me but little idea of the country. The people in
general do not <PB N="85" REF="93"/> look healthy—All the women wear what
is called a mezzaro, viz. about two yards or more of black silk or chintz,
wrapped about their heads and shoulders, instead of a cloak, it is
extremely graceful, if well put on. Every woman has an opportunity of hiding a
defect, or shewing a beauty, as they may conceal one eye, the throat, the
forehead, the chin, or in short suffer those they meet to see only what
they choose to display. The mezzaro too has a great con∣venience, which is,
that a woman can so hide herself in it, that she may walk all over the
town unknown; this mezzaro is particularly advantageous to a person with fine
shoulders and eyes. There are but two streets in the town where carriages
can go; so that sedan chairs or walking are the principal methods of going
from one place to another.—</P>
<P>The females among the lower class dis∣gusted me much by their
head-dress—their hair is strained up to a point on the top of their
head, and fastened to a pin—judge what a figure an old greyheaded or
bald woman must make.—</P>
<P><PB N="86" REF="94"/> I cannot help thinking this once flourish∣ing
republic, notwithstanding the opulence of some of its noble families, is
becoming very fast a dependent on, or a creature of the court of France. Some
of their nobles marry into French families—and soon lose their
fortune and their patriotic ideas in the extravagance and servility of that
court—Corsica is a melancholy proof of this opi∣nion—</P>
<P>Of the two noble Genoese, to whom I had letters, the lady is dead,
and the gen∣tleman is not here; so that I have announc∣ed myself no where,
as I would not be de∣tained here longer than just to see the churches and
pictures, and though I should have been pleased to have seen the manner
of living of the Genoese nobles, I would not upon any account get into a
train of mi∣nisters dinners and visits—</P>
<P>I have been much surprised to see a black Virgin and child in
one of the churches here: unless it be to tempt Negroes to turn Christians.
I cannot conceive why they suf∣fer it to remain—</P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="95"/> I have been on board the
<HI>Galéres</HI>—and if the variety of very fine pictures have
de∣lighted me, the sight of heavy chains, and so many human beings enduring
slavery for years, has shocked me beyond description; yet they do not
look unhappy; and I think servitude a more rational punishment for some
crimes than death; but slavery to an English mind, I suppose, must be
very horrible by what I feel—</P>
<P>Yesterday two Algerine slaves came to my apartment to sell
slippers; the oldest of the two was one of the handsomest brown men,
with the best countenance I ever saw; he has been a slave five-and-twenty
years, and is suffered to go about without the usual attendant, which is a
man with a stout stick in his hand, who follows the slaves who walk about
the town chained together, always in pairs—</P>
<P>When I thought upon the fate of this old man; guilty of no crime; a
prisoner of war; his looks so noble and so honest; I wept, and wished
I might have had interest <PB N="88" REF="96"/> enough with the Doge and
Senate of Genoa to have sent him home to Al∣giers—</P>
<P>These sort of pictures in real life, are of a dark hue: I must
therefore again turn to those I have seen in the palaces; I confess I
should not dislike to pass three winter months here to examine them at
leisure, and copy a few. There is a bust of Vitellius in one of the
palaces, for which I am assured the Duke of Marlborough offered to give its
weight in gold. The sum must necessarily have been very large, for the
bust is so massy that it probably weighs above half any other marble
statue: But it does much honour to the duke's taste, as the work is
perfect; and much likewise to the possessor, to prize so highly
what deserves so well to be esteemed. I have been offered any price I
choose to ask for a chestnut Suffolk-horse here; the stable it is in
is crowd∣ed every day, and it grieves some of the Genoese very much that I
will not part with him; but I think a good woman's <PB N="89" REF="97"/> horse
is so difficult to be had, that I never can understand how any person can
part with one—</P>

<P>I Set out again in a felucca, intending to land at Leghorn, but
contrary winds or calms became so tiresome to me, that I landed at an
Italian port called Via regia, had my coach taken out, and set out by land
for this place. I have passed through a forest of oaks, belonging to the
Grand Duke.</P>
<P>Some of these oaks are the largest and finest looking
timber-trees I ever saw; I am assured here the wood is not hard and good,
like our English oak; if so, I suppose it is affected by the
climate—</P>
<P>I could not help reflecting in one of the finest palaces at Genoa
on the want of unity and order, the two principles on <PB N="91" REF="99"/>
which good taste is founded, that is ever discovered in the dress and
ornaments of all kinds which foreigners have—</P>
<P>I had passed through an immense suite of rooms, each more
magnificent than the other; when coming into the bed-chamber of the
mistress of the house, her dress which she had pulled off the night
before, even her bracelets and rings lay upon a table, and I can with truth
assert, no village-girl could have adorned herself with more mean,
ordinary, paltry finery than was exhi∣bited. The heir to this noble house, a
child of about two years old, that had taken a fancy to my looks, and
accompanied me through the apartments, was dressed like∣wise in a
coarse coloured linen—</P>
<P>These circumstances were such contrasts to the house, that
it brought to my mind a hundred examples of the like in France, where often, to
get at the most elegant <HI>Salle de Compagnie,</HI> you are obliged to
pass through a dirty antichamber, where you are forced to hold up your
petticoats, <PB N="92" REF="100"/> that you may not sweep in to the inner
rooms a load of filth. In the streets you meet a magnificent carriage,
attended by servants in costly liveries, drawn by a pair of dog-horses,
the harness of which a hack∣ney-coachman would not use with us; and
frequently at Paris the finest hotels have their architecture disgraced by
the black funnel of a temporary chimney, run∣ning out at a window or through a
cor∣nice—</P>
<P>These incongruities cannot be imagined, nor believed, but by
those that have seen them. With us cleanliness constitutes our first
elegance; and fitness of things is next considered; and I believe it is the
combi∣nation of these two circumstances which enchants foreigners of
sense and parts so much in England—</P>
<P>The Grand Duke and Duchess are here, so that the apartments
usually let out to company are taken up by them and their suite—</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="101"/> I have hired a comfortable house here by the
week; these baths, first built by the Roman Emperors, are kept in excellent
re∣pair; and well they may, for the bathing is excessively dear—</P>
<P>There is a public room at the palace, where the company assemble
about nine in the evening; the heat in the day is exces∣sive; all the
Italians lie down and sleep after dinner, and get up to dress about six,
walk afterwards, and meet in the great room. I met the Grand Duchess last
night, with another lady; I had not the least idea who she was, being
followed by a single foot∣man in grey; she looked at me with the greatest
attention, and curtsied very civil∣ly; I curtsied and stared at her, from
her extreme likeness to my cousin of witty me∣mory, the late lady
T—</P>
<P>I was pestered to death with questions about my harp at night. I
find a harp with pedals is a very rare thing in Italy, and an English
person meets with homage little short of adoration. The very shopkeepers 
<PB N="94" REF="102"/> and peasants look in my face and
say—<HI>Cara—Cara Inglese—</HI></P>
<P>These baths are very good for palsies, paralytic disorders,
gout, rheumatism, and scrophulous complaints, Pisa and Lucca are near;
Pisa, I find, the Grand Duke pre∣fers to Florence. I should think an
invalid might pass a comfortable winter here—</P>

<P>I Have rode over to Pisa, where I have been much entertained; the
cathedral, the baptistery, and the Campo Santo are well worthy a voyage from
England—</P>
<P>The leaning tower, which you may probably have seen, or at least
read and heard many accounts of, is a proof, among many others, that in all
ages fancy is too often mistaken for taste—It has the appearance of
patchwork, from the variety of orders of architecture displayed in the
pillars, which stand in rows one above the other, from the base to the
top—As to the learned in building pretending to say the tower was built
leaning, only to shew the excellence of the workmanship, they 
<PB N="96" REF="104"/> certainly delude themselves, or desire to im∣pose
upon credulous persons—There are many proofs of the ground having
sunk; one infallible, according to my judgment; and that is, the first row
of pillars being above half buried in the earth—This tower stands by
itself—some paces from it I entered the cathedral through brass
doors brought from Jerusalem, represent∣ing, in relievo, the history of
Christ—but I would prefer the possession of one pannel of the
folding doors on the opposite side of the cathedral to the whole of
these; for the modern relievo, executed by John of Bologna, is full of grace
and nature; while the ancient seems chiseled out by an awkward
carpenter—There is a beau∣tiful urn placed on a pillar on the outside
of the church, which was shewn formerly as the cup which measured the
tribute paid to Caesar—but that mistake is now rec∣tified, and the
true ancient use restored to it—it contained the ashes of some
illustri∣ous personage—A fine sarcophagus is likewise placed at
the door of the cathe∣dral, as a monument to the Comtesse 
<PB N="97" REF="105"/> Matilda—who was sovereign of this
coun∣try—and is said piously to have added much to the magnificence
of these buildings—but the croisades have afforded their most
curious relics—</P>
<P>I refer you to books for a precise and minute account of all that
is to be seen in this vast and magnificent cathedral; I have only time to
give you a few obser∣vations—</P>
<P>The chief altar is composed mostly of lapis lazuli and all that
is rare and costly—Some of the pictures are fine, but the ca∣thedral is
too dark to permit them to be seen to advantage—At the lower end is a
handsome sarcophagus to the memory of the Emperor Henry VII. who was
poisoned by a priest at the holy table with a consc∣crated
wafer—</P>
<P>I quitted the Cathedral to go into the Baptistery, a building
standing like the tower at a small distance from the cathedral; it is
shaped like a handsome bell—the first and <PB N="98" REF="106"/>
second row of pillars on the outside of this, one above the other, are in a
good stile; but the man dying without leaving a drawing, or plan of his
intentions towards the finishing, the upper part is finished in the gothic
stile, and ill done—</P>
<P>There are granite pillars at the entrance, very fine
indeed—</P>
<P>The front is very remarkable, it is im∣mensely large, of white
marble, beautiful Mosaic sculpture in different pannels, which surround
the outside—and the de∣sign of every one differs from the others,
so that there are not two alike—</P>
<P>The sculpture too of the pulpit is very fine; it represents a
groupe of personages—I was told they were all portraits—many of
the faces are ridiculous caricaturas—but some barbarous travellers have
plucked off several of the heads; a thing easily done by a strong hand,
as they are not so large as my fist, when doubled; if <PB N="99" REF="107"/>
you have never seen that, you may guess at the size from what I
say—</P>
<P>The Campo Santo is earth brought from Jerusalem, which had the
singular pro∣perty of destroying the dead bodies put into it,
four-and-twenty hours after they had lain there. It was the burying-place of
the noble Pisans, when Pisa was a flou∣rishing republic; at present no
use is made of it; it is an oblong square built round with a cloister;
the length is three hundred and fifty feet, in the center is deposed the holy
earth, round which reign Gothic arches forming doors and windows, these
arches are so light and simple, that they seem to hold together by magic
power; and if any thing could reconcile me to the Gothic, these arches would:
against the wall on the opposite side from the cloister, there are the
remains of a painting <HI>en fresque</HI> upon the plaster, which is very
fine.—This plaster or stucco is broken off in several places, and
discovers that the outlines of the painting were done upon the wall,
be∣sore the stucco was laid on; this appears <PB N="100" REF="108"/>
perfectly incomprehensible, as the stucco is thick, and can never have been
transparent—but I am affured that the red lines un∣derneath, which
appear to me to be com∣mon chalk pencil, were done with a com∣position which
pierced through the stucco when wet, in a faint line, the only way of
accounting for this singular circumstance—I confess the drawing on
the wall is done with so much more freedom and boldness than the painting
expresses, that I wished all the stucco fallen off, that I might see
all the spirit of the design at once.—As I walked back through the
town, I was shewn an ugly strange-shaped tower, where Ugo∣lino and his
innocent family were starved to death—As I looked at it, I thought,
that if every man in these days, who did not exert his utmost abilities to
save his country, was starved to death, there might be formed a large
regiment of good cooks wanting employment—</P>
<P>The grass grows in every street in the town; a melancholy proof
of the sad reverse <PB N="101" REF="109"/> this city exhibits to that
picture it once gave the admiring world—</P>
<P>There are many remarkable mouments placed in the cloisters of the
Campo Santo. The King of Prussia has erected one in memory of
Algarotti—I cannot possibly give you a list of them—I only
mean to be your finger post, just to point out to you what is worth
seeing, if chance or choice should lead you this way—</P>
<P>I was shewn several curious statues, and pillars in the
streets; till night only, as usual, sent me home—</P>

<P>SINCE I wrote last, I have been to see Lucca—a virgin
republic, for it has never lost its liberty. The motto over the gates, or
wherever it can be placed, is <HI>Libertas.</HI> The territories belonging to
it are only for∣ty-six miles long from St. Pellegrins to the Pisan
mountains, and nineteen from Via regia to Porquetto, the half of which town
belongs to the Tuscan dominion—</P>
<P>Lucca is extremely well fortified; crouds of people in the street,
and a look of opu∣lence among the <HI>bourgeoisie</HI> prove the good effect
of their motto. The oil is remark∣ably good here. I was shewn the Cathedral,
which has nothing very remarkable in it but a circular chapel, the shape of
which is <PB N="103" REF="111"/> pleasing, and it has four statues of the
Apostles, good. I was told this chapel, dedicated to the Virgin, was
transported in one night, entire, from another church at some distance.
The figure of the Virgin I could not see, it was covered up; she wears
constantly golden slippers, and there is a skull of one of the senators
of Lucca, who was hung for stealing one of them, though he declared that
she flung it at him, as he was praying at her feet for more wealth—</P>
<P>I met in the inn —, whom I cer∣tainly should not have
recollected again, his countenance is so altered: I believe the Muses
should not marry, and he certainly is one —</P>
<P>There is something romantic and <HI>pitto∣resque</HI> in the
manner of training the vines here. In the low grounds they twine round the
trees which surround the little enclosures, and hang in festoons from one
tree to another. The oxen too are of a particular kind, very large, and of no
other colour but a light grey; in a small field I <PB N="104" REF="112"/> have
seen these yoked to a plough, prepar∣ing one corner of it for corn, while
the rest was filled with melons, olive, and fig-trees: I am told the sun is
powerful enough to bring the fruits of the earth to perfection through the
branches of the trees; if so, they are extremely careless in making their
wine; there is little or none to be bought good.—</P>
<P>I do not know what people mean by say∣ing Italy is a beautiful
country; a want of fine trees and turf makes it in general very ugly. If
travellers would content them∣selves with saying, that in Italy, a person
who is passionately fond of the fine arts might find constant
amusement, I believe the praise would be just; but when led by their
enthusiasm for them, they say, Italy is the finest country in the
world, they prepare many people, as easy in their faith as I am, to be as
much disappointed as I have been—</P>
<P>A lady on a side-saddle is an object of great wonder here; the
peasants who pass <PB N="105" REF="113"/> me on the right hand, when I am on
horse∣back, the women, particularly, say, <HI>Pove∣rina—Jesu
Maria—Povera—una gambia—</HI></P>
<P>They actually fancy I have one leg only; their stare of concern
always makes me laugh; and then they add <HI>cara</HI> to their la∣mentations.
In a day or two I shall set out for Florence, from whence I shall write
to you. I confess I long to see the Venus de Medicis, and the Niobe family.
I do not envy the Grand Duke his sovereignty; but his collection of
perfections, I confess, I should like to share with him—</P>

<P>I Hope you do not expect a very rational letter from me, as I have
been three days successively to see the statues and pictures, and am
so much delighted with them, that I am at a loss how to give you an account
of my feelings, otherwise than by telling you, that while I am in the
Tribune, the vulgar idle tale of real life never once comes into my mind, and I
feel quite happy; and if till now I have been sorry often, when I have felt
conscious of having nice feelings, or what is commonly called taste, at
this moment I am extremely glad of it; I think and dream of nothing but the
statues, from the time I leave them till I see them again; so till a few
days repetition of the same sights has familiarized my head to them, I 
<PB N="107" REF="115"/> shall content myself with telling you two little
adventures I have had; which may prove to you I have neither lost my
eye-sight nor my pleasantry upon occasions which fret and anger
others—</P>
<P>I set out from the Pisa baths on the 23d in the afternoon; I
sent on my coach and some of my servants two posts, and went on
horseback myself: when I got about half way, I passed by a gentleman in
an English phaeton, whose curiosity I suppose was awakened by an
English horse and side-saddle. From an uncommon slow trot he flew
after me full gallop; I was warned of this frightful operation by my servant,
and had just time to turn my horse into a gateway; he could not stop his
horses im∣mediately, but being determined to see me, as soon as he could,
he pulled up, and went as slow as it was possible: I thought this so
impertinent, that I determined on my part, that he should not see me; so
I desired the person who accompanied me to follow me; and I passed by
the left side of the phaeton as fast as my horse could go, 
<PB N="108" REF="116"/> with my hat and head so low, that the foolish man
could not see me. My horse is a most excellent and fleet one, and I kept
him on till my pursuer gave up the chase; and I then, when out of his
sight, turned into a farm-yard, and hid myself, till I saw the phaeton
pass again; so I positively got to my carriage without being seen by
this curious gentleman—</P>
<P>The man at the post-house, upon my asking for something to
drink, brought me a bottle of white wine, which he told me he had made
himself, and which he would have given to no one but me; it was the very
best white I ever tasted since I drank <HI>vin d'Arbois,</HI> with which
Henry <HI>quatre</HI> used to drink to his fair Gabrielle; but I mixed it
with water, <HI>parcequ'il faut que les Dames mettent un peu d'eau dans leur
vin—</HI></P>
<P>The man was quite offended at my of∣fering to pay for it—</P>
<P>So I thanked him with one of my best smiles, and got into my
coach, where I had <PB N="109" REF="117"/> not been above two hours before I was
fast asleep, and waked only to see the walls of Florence, which do not
seem calculated to defend it from any enemies, but those which smuggling
might create to the Tus∣can sovereign's purse—</P>
<P>I went to Meggit's inn, and got into bed about four o'clock in the
morning. I have the same apartment my mother and Lady Louisa H—
occupied—when there.</P>
<P>The next day, the first thing I did, was to go and see the Venus
de Medicis: I was shewn a youthful figure opposite as an Apollo; and after
I had examined it some time, I asked why it was called an Apollo. Does not
Eccelenza see, says the guide, his attribute the lyre? I do, returned I,
but that is modern to the statue; I made my observation; the man laughed.
You are perfectly right, said he, and I do not know any other reason for
its being an Apollo, than because probably that God was thought a proper
companion for the Venus. But how did you know those pieces were
res∣stored? <PB N="110" REF="118"/> said he; I told him from some
ob∣servations I had made upon other fine works of that sort—</P>
<P>However this statue is very pleasing; but I do not think it has
the commanding look of the God of day. I looked at the face with delight; for
about the nose and upper lip it put me in mind of my dear son William, who,
probably, is now nearly as tall—</P>
<P>It is lucky for my friends that I have that son and some others,
for in the humour I am in, I could almost be tempted to remain a prisoner
for life, upon condition my <HI>ca∣cbot</HI> was the Tribune; and I would ask
for no other company than the heavenly inani∣mate figures in it, their
silence is so much more eloquent than language, their forms so
harmonious. I think you begin not to understand me, and as I am not at all
cer∣tain, if your ear and your eye agree toge∣ther, as mine do, I will not
attempt to ex∣plain what may be felt, but not described; so I beg you would
recollect I did not pro∣mise <PB N="111" REF="119"/> this letter should be
perfectly rational; and I believe I am in my sober senses, when I have
courage to end my rhap∣sody—</P>
<CLOSER>
<SIGNED>I remain your's affectionately—</SIGNED> <POSTSCRIPT>
<P><HI>P. S.</HI> Apropos, on looking over my let∣ter, I find that I
have forgot to tell you, the only object I took notice of, from my coach going
to Florence, was the moon; it put me in mind of what Mr. de Caraccioli says;
<HI>que la lune de Naples valait bien le so∣leil d' Angleterre;</HI> however
our English sun has but one fault notwithstanding the Mar∣quis's witty
remark; and that is the same that an English mind has—peeping through
a cloud too often. The Venus suited the ideas I had formed of her; but the
Niobe family surpassed them; there is a horse be∣longing to that, which
is not placed in the <PB N="112" REF="120"/> room with them, and which certainly
was held by the bridle by one of the sons. Every thing else seems to be
in perfect order—</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>FLORENCE, 
<DATE>October 12, 1785,</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>THIS city is very clean and chearful; the streets are paved with
large flat pieces of rock, unlike any other pavement I have seen, and much
smoother; fine statues and relievos in marble stand in the squares and
angles of streets, without having any thing to protect them but the respect
the very lowest people have for them—Sir Horace Mann, Lord Cowper, the
Prince Corsini, the Lucca minister Comte Santini, and the Comte d'Albany,
give great dinners here to all foreigners of distinction; but the Floren∣tine
noblesse never invite any one to dine or sup at their houses—When
they give an entertainment, it is an assembly, where every creature that
can call itself a gentle∣man or gentlewoman, can easily go—I was at
one the other night given on account of a wedding, and though it was but a few 
<PB N="114" REF="122"/> paces from our English minister's house, all his
carriages, horses, and servants, paraded with flambeaux to the
house—I went in one of his coaches with him—The mistress of
the house, and bride, stood at the door to receive every body, and
curtsey to them as they passed—The number of rooms opened and
illuminated upon such an oc∣casion is incredible—I was told in this
house there were eleven rooms which were not seen, because they were not
finished—I could not help observing that all the hand∣some
Florentines are very like the English, an effect perhaps of the great
partiality the Italian ladies have for my country people. What I mean is, that
as they have con∣stantly so many English people here, their looking at
them constantly may very natu∣rally occasion the likeness—</P>
<P>The Italian ladies are very good-humored, which is more than I can
say for their neigh∣bours the French, and they have likewise more natural
civility to strangers; for they do not stare at them, and whisper to one
another, so as to leave no doubt to the <PB N="115" REF="123"/>
<HI>Anglaise</HI> that her dress is criticised; but they speak to her,
and if they remark any thing new to them, they do not tell her, <HI>ce n'est
pas a-la-mode</HI>—but they suppose it is the fashion of the
country she is come from—</P>
<P>The sovereign might make Florence a paradise; but he keeps no
court—There is nothing about his manner of living that betrays either the
gaiety or magnificence that naturally belong to royalty—Any person
whose rank suits presentation might be presented to the Grand Duke or
Duchess, but I shall certainly not be so; for sove∣reigns, like the
sun, should chear with their rays the people who look up to them; and when
they choose to hide those rays in a corner, strangers must be very
foolish to go and seek them out, disturb their privacy, and gain neither
pleasure nor amusement by it. Florence swarms with English—The
operas here are very indifferent—</P>
<P>In the palaces here, there are generally several indifferent
pictures mixed with a few good ones—There are two Apostles out of four,
painted by Carlo Dolci, in the <PB N="116" REF="124"/> Palazzo Riccardi, which I
think invaluable; there is a Muse by the same in the Palazzo
Corsini—</P>
<P>The Grand Duke has just purchased from the Dini family a picture
done by Guercino da Cento, and placed it in the Tribune; it is an Endymion
sleeping the sweetness and beauty of the countenance are enchant∣ing; but
Guercino was so taken up with the mortal, that he has represented the
Goddess in one corner of the sky, like the paring of of a nail, however
this new pur∣chase is well worthy a place in the Tribune; It cost the Grand
Duke not quite an hun∣dred guineas—</P>
<P>I have been obliged again to assure the French, at the French
minister's table the other day, that Sir George Elliot was not born of French
parents—</P>
<P>Sterne's adventure about Yorick, I have now good reason to believe
was a fact; for I was asked too by a Frenchman if Sir Joshua Reynolds did
not build St. Paul's. <PB N="117" REF="125"/> I think Frenchmen should never
quit Paris; for they do not choose to be acquainted with the chronology or
genealogies of any other nation but their own. The only thing which seems to
delight the French minister here is, that the bridge over the Arno, which is
just before his windows, puts him in mind of the Pont-neuf at Paris; the only
observation I have ever heard him make upon the beauties of this
town—</P>
<P>Judge of my surprise the other morning. Meggit came running in
haste to my apart∣ments, to assure me, that Lord B— would be here
in two or three days, he was at Venice he said, and produced a letter to
prove his assertion; but as I thought I was more likely to have
intelligence than he was, and as the name was not spelt right, I contented
myself with telling him to re∣serve, as long as he could, an apartment
adjoining to mine, then empty, and pro∣mised him I should endeavour to make
him lodge there; though my brother wrote me <PB N="118" REF="126"/> word, he
should have <HI>une maison montée</HI> if he should pass the
winter in Italy; but I think it will be less trouble for him and me to be
here, if Florence is the place he fixes in—</P>
<P>There is a charming ride here about a mile from the town, in a wood
of the Grand Duke's, called the Cashins, (where the ladies walk or go in
phaetons, called here <HI>Bir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>hes</HI>)—but its chief-beauty, the most enormous firs I
ever beheld, are now felling; — There is also a dairy, where cream,
milk, and butter are sold, at a royal price indeed. There is an excellent
invention in it to keep the milk sweet in this hot climate, the pans are
placed in a trough or frame, full constantly of fresh water, which runs in
at one end and out at the other.—Talking of inventions too; I wonder why
in all great cities they do not copy one from the clock in the Piazza <HI>di
gran Duca</HI> here, the figures shewing the hour are transparencies, with
a light behind them; so that in the darkest night, the sober citizen can
see what hour of the night it is—</P>
<P><PB N="119" REF="127"/> Lucca Giordano's painting <HI>en
fresque</HI> here I admire; though he was called <HI>fa presto</HI>
because he ended in three weeks what most painters would have been two
years about; but the genius that could produce such effect by drawing, in
so short a time, has that freedom and grace, which the precision
attendant on study seldom can give—</P>
<P>Miss Davies is here, and I am very sorry she does not sing
at the opera; for her voice and manner please me more than any thing I have
heard here—</P>
<CLOSER>
<SIGNED>Your's affectionately—</SIGNED> <POSTSCRIPT>
<P><HI>P. S.</HI> The Titian Venus, and the child by Titian in the
Strozzi palace, are both much impaired by time; very soon the copies will be
invaluable, because necessa∣rily all the beauties of the originals must
vanish—</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>BOLOGNA, 
<DATE>Nov. 15, 1785</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Received about a week since a letter from Lord B—,
informing me that he could not pass this winter in Italy; so I im∣mediately
determined my course; and it is North. Now I am on the wing, I will see
courts and people that few women have seen, as I may never have an
opportunity of travelling again; and I will make the best use of my time;
few as the months are I can allow myself to run about in, I will employ them,
I hope, to my satisfaction and your amusement—</P>
<P>I stopped my coach to look at the flame which issues
constantly from the ground <PB N="121" REF="129"/> about four miles from
Fillegara: Mr. Dutens mentions it in his Itinerary. From Florence to Fillegara
the road winds round one brown mountain to another; but to-day the landscape
improved much on my ap∣proaching Loianc. Some spots were not unworthy the
pencil of Salvator Rosa.—There is a beautiful descent of a mile and a
half to Pianoro; I there got upon my horse and rode to this place; and I can
never believe it is ten miles from Pianoro here, which I am assured it is.
I lodge at the Locando Reale, a large inn, the mistress of which
assured me the Princess Czartoriska was in Bologna; but it proves to be
the Princess Lubomirska, her sister-in-law, whom I do not know; I have
only time to tell you, if you should ever pass through this city, that you
must ask to see the Palazzo Zampieri, the church of St. Giovanni in
monte, and a few others. This is a clean looking town, but I do not comprehend
the dialect; I had accustomed myself to the Tuscan manner of
substituting the <HI>H</HI> for the <HI>C;</HI> but here, I do not conceive
what letters they put in <PB N="122" REF="130"/> the place of those which they
ought to pro∣nounce —</P>
<P>I can tell you no more at present. I mean to get to Venice as
soon as possible; from thence to Vienna, and I afterwards intend to
proceed to Warsaw and Petersburgh. I take the advantage of the winter, in
hopes I may go on a sledge the greatest part of my road, for I hate the
jumbling of a coach, though mine is as easy as possible. Pray do not make
yourself unhappy concerning the delicacy of my constitution, and the dread
of pulmonary affections, for I assure you I have neither had a pain in my
breast, nor spit blood, since I quitted the environs of Paris, which
makes me suppose the air of that part of France did not agree with me; and
I hope the frequent change of air I am taking will strengthen my
consti∣tution, so that I shall never have any re∣turns of those ugly
complaints; it is <PB N="123" REF="131"/> now four months since I was last
troubled with them. Adieu, dear Sir; believe that the greater the distance is
between me and the objects of my affection, the more I am anxious to hear from
them, so write often to your affectionate sister—</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXVI.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>VENICE, 
<DATE>NOV. 18, 1785.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Stopped for a moment at Cento, to see the picture which is
called Guercino's <HI>chef d'oeuvre;</HI> he was born there, and is buried in
the Cathedral. From thence I proceeded to Ferrara, my road to which I advise
none to go by night; the country all about is so low and flat, that the road,
to be passa∣ble, is raised upon a causeway, with nothing to prevent
your horses from rolling down on one side or the other; it is extremely
narrow likewise. Ariosto, who was born and died at Ferrara, did not gallop
his Pegasus, or invoke his Muse in the clay, and among the dismal poplars
to be seen in the small fields thereabouts; I went about three miles an
hour, I slept at Ferrara, and among twenty things served up to my table at
supper, I could eat nothing but celery. In <PB N="125" REF="133"/> Italy
cinnamon is an ingredient they put into every dish, which I have a mortal
aver∣sion to, woodcocks stewed in sugar, and chickens roasted till they
are as hard and as dry as wood—<HI>voila la cuisine—</HI></P>
<P>I embarked with my coach in a very good boat at a place called
Francolino, and was rowed down the Po; I had a fine clear sky, and did not
feel that I was in the month of November: From the Po I came into a canal, and
from thence into the Brenta, a pretty but narrow river; except the Sorgue, it
was the only clear stream I had looked into since I had left my native
Thames; I heard much of the beautiful villas on the borders of the Brenta; but
I saw none that gave me the idea of elegance or beauty on the
outside—</P>
<P>A mile before I arrived at Fusino, a vil∣lage, where I was obliged
to leave my coach and saddle-horses, I passed a lock which separates
the salt water from the fresh, and there quitted the land, going five miles
across the sea, intermixed with flat sands, <PB N="126" REF="134"/> to get
into the great canal at Venice. I had just read the Abbé Coyer, who
says, <HI>Rome est batie par les hommes; mais Venise par les Dieux,</HI>
and I had formed some idea of it from the pictures I had seen, and expected
to see a gay clean looking town, with quays on each side of the canals; but
was ex∣tremely disappointed; the houses are in the water, and look dirty
and uncomfortable on the outside; the fine palaces have most of them above
half their windows shut up by dirty shutters not painted.</P>
<P>The innumerable quantity of gondolas too, that look like swimming
coffins, added to the dismal scene; and, I confess, Venice on my arrival
struck me rather with horror than with pleasure; but now that I am
ac∣customed to a gondola, have seen the inside of the <HI>Casini,</HI>
and have trusted to my own eyes about several things, I cannot say I
dislike Venice in the least. The whole scene is unlike any thing I could
have ima∣gined: I walk all the morning, and that is the best way of seeing
the town and peo∣ple. There are narrow passages that you 
<PB N="127" REF="135"/> arrive at from one to another by bridges which cross
the small canals; the famed Rialto is built across the large canal, the
arch of which is very noble and light; but there are three distinct
passages over it, formed by rows of shops, the tops of which are so
heavy that they disfigure this fine bridge very much; you may walk quite from
one end of Venice to the other. The extraordinary figures I saw in the Piazza
San Marco would tempt one to believe, it is a <HI>bal masqué en plein
air.</HI> We are not now in the time of the Carnaval; but I meet as many men in
black dominos and masks as without them; these are the no∣ble Venetians,
who, constantly watched by the state-spies, dare not go about
un∣masked; for if an ambassador's servant, or a minister, or consul
of any other nation, was seen speaking to a noble Venetian, he might be
imprisoned: The laws are so ex∣cessively strict upon this subject,
that the <HI>Corps diplomatique</HI> are confined extremely in their society,
and I am amazed any gen∣tleman can accept of an embassy to a place where
the natives must avoid them, as if <PB N="128" REF="136"/> they were infected
with the plague.—Strangers pass their time well here; for nothing can
be more sociable, civil, and magnificent, than the ministers are to one
another, and strangers presented to them—</P>
<P>The Casini are very small houses hired by one person, or a
set of people, to meet in of an evening, where cards, conversation, tea,
coffee, lemonade, &amp;c. and a well se∣lected society conspire to give
pleasure: These Casini are fitted up with an elegance of which you can
form no idea; I have dined in one, which has so fine a view from it, that
from the neatness and taste of the inside, and of the magnificence of the
objects on the without, I could almost have fancied a little fairy's palace.
Venice seems to me to be a new world, retired and different from any other I
have seen; the Venetian ladies are some of them very handsome, and a few
of them are most re∣markably determined in their resolutions. It is not an
uncommon thing here for a lady, married in the morning, to declare to her
parents before night that she has taken <PB N="129" REF="137"/> an aversion
to her husband, who, upon such an occasion, is forced with the parents to
apply to the great master of the church (the Pope) who is always good enough
to admit of the reasons given him, as suffi∣cient to grant a divorce; the
lady, once out of her convent, bears the name of her own family in the world,
and the gentle∣man looks out for another wife—</P>
<P>Nothing is more frequent here than to see a Venetian lady quit her
palace, for months together, to live in a casino; of which the husband
perhaps does not even know the situation; I could divert you ex∣tremely with
some Venetian anecdotes, but I have no leisure to make this letter much
longer; for between my Venetian acquaintance and the ambassadors I have
scarcely time to breathe. The Comte Justiniani was delighted to see me
again; he has promised to accompany me to the Arsenal, which is extremely
large, and where the man, who shewed it to me, was pleased to say, the
State was building frigates of a hundred guns each, and twenty 
<PB N="130" REF="138"/> such lies. The ancient families of Venice are the
most pure noblesse in Italy, and that idea, together with their natural
spirit and extraordinary situation, will produce many brave and gallant
soldiers among them, whenever a good cause calls them into the
field—</P>
<P>Adieu, dear Sir, I have three gondolas waiting at my door for me,
so I quit my pen.—</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXVII.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>VENICE, 
<DATE>Nov. 24. 1785.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Have been to see the Doge's palace, and the church in the Piazza
San Marco, both Gothic, and what is very shocking to the eye, the fine bronze
horses brought from Constantinople are perched over the door of the church.
Books will inform you more minutely than I can of the pictures to be seen in
Venice. The council chamber is a very fine room; but all the paintings in it
are dirty; I went likewise into the court of justice, because every body
was running to hear l'Avocato Stephano; and I thought from the grimaces and
gesticulations Italians make use of in common conversation, some
entertainment might be expected from one, upon an occasion, where art would
natu∣rally produce action. Nor was I deceived; nothing can be more comic than
what I saw—his pleading was scolding—and his 
<PB N="132" REF="140"/> two thumbs which he had stuck upright, and moved very
quickly from and near his breast, was perhaps the most ridiculous ac∣tion
that ever was imagined, nor can I con∣ceive how any persons, much less the
judges, could keep their countenances.</P>
<P>It is impossible for you to imagine any thing more entertaining
than the Piazza San Marco: people of every nation, and in dresses I never
saw, and indeed never can see but at Venice, are lounging in the shops
and coffee-houses; and it is a great amuse∣ment to me as I walk there every
morning. But I never stay long, for they read English in my looks; and
their love for any thing of that nation is so great, that they will come from
the other end of the Piazza to look at an English woman—</P>
<P>There are two fine lions at the door of the Arsenal, in marble,
brought from the entrance of the Piraean port: it is a pity I cannot make them
speak, they might tell me many things I want to know about Athens—</P>
<P><PB N="133" REF="141"/> The house I lodge in is miserably cold,
it is upon the grand canal—and as the gla∣ziers here seldom put putty
to the panes of glass, the winds come in. This damp sea-air agrees
perfectly well with me — Provisions are very good here; every lady
seems determined to be amused and chear∣ful, and I think I could pass a
very merry winter here; there are several theatres, and I have been to an
opera—very good. The Russian minister's wife is Madame de —'s
daughter, a very young, and very amiable modest woman. The Minister's wife
from Vienna is likewise extremely sen∣sible and polite, and her husband
the best man in the world; and I must not forget, for the honour of our
country, Madame de —, who from her charming disposition and talents I
absolutely love so much, that it will be a grief to me to part with her.
The Russian Minister's wife often talks to me of Stowe in raptures,
though she was quite a child when she passed some days
there—</P>
<P><PB N="134" REF="142"/> Mr. Emo's floating batteries are much
spoken of here; I understand they were five hours and a half before the
forts of Golleta; so I have desired a receipt to make them, and I have it
as exactly <HI>to be</HI> copied as any receipt to make a good pye; I shall
give it to G. B—, who being a professor in the art of war, may
present to our ene∣mies a dish of the same sort of his making, whenever
occasion requires he should treat them according to their
deserts—</P>
<P>I must tell you a most ridiculous thing that has happened to two
English travellers that are here now, and advise every gentle∣man who
cannot speak German, not to tra∣vel in Germany without a companion, or
servant that knows the language. These gentlemen not having either, were in
great haste to arrive at Venice from Vienna; they left a large town they had
slept at over night, one morning, and, after travelling post for two days,
found themselves drove into the very town they had quitted, eight-and-forty
hours before If they hate the <PB N="135" REF="143"/> motion of a carriage as I
do; I can easily guess how angry they must have been—</P>
<P>I am advised to take a new road to Vi∣enna as the best. I
shall write from thence, I hope soon; as I do not mean to proceed in a
retrograde motion—so with all kind wishes to your
fire-side—</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>VIENNA, 
<DATE>Dec. 14, 1785.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Came, as I told you I was advised, by a new road; but I should
imagine from the difficulties I met with it was the worst. It is true, some
of them were owing to rivers, which, swelled by the late rains, are be∣come
torrents which have carried whole vil∣lages and many miles of the road before
them—</P>
<P>I set out from Venice on the 30th of last month, going by water
to Mestre, where my coach and horses met me. I meant that night to have
slept at Mr. —, at Cor∣negliano; but the weather was so bad that I
was obliged to stay at a village called Tre∣visa, where there is an
excellent and clean inn. The next day, I endeavoured to cross the river, but
the boatmen would not ven∣ture <PB N="137" REF="145"/> over, though I had my
coach embark∣ed, and would have gone myself, knowing I was expected by Mr.
—, so I was obliged to return to the good inn—where I was
surprised to see, what I thought a fine large chicken served up to my
table, which upon cutting, I found to have brown flesh; I asked what it
was, and was answered—<HI>una Colombina</HI>—it was a pigeon. I
begged to see one alive, or at least with the feathers on, for it must
have been a most extraordi∣nary sight; but the people seemed more
astonished at my admiration of this bird than I was at the size of it;
for it is the com∣mon pigeon there—</P>
<P>The next day, the rain and wind being somewhat abated, I got to
Cornegliano, and you may imagine the real pleasure I was re∣ceived with by a
countryman, who had not seen me for many years, and that in my own house in
the country. I never was more delighted in my life than by the music I heard
there; his eldest daughter, a child about seven years old, plays on the
harpsi∣chord with a taste and feeling at which few <PB N="138" REF="146"/>
people, more advanced in age and music, ever arrive. Her sister too, an
infant of five years of age, played and sung her part afterwards wonderfully
for her years—</P>
<P>In the evening many of the Venetian no∣blesse came to partake of
the concert, and see the Donna Inglese; among Mr. —'s country
neighbours there were several who were as fat, fair, and heavy as many of our
English Country 'Squires, and, like them, had never stirred from their
family mansion; and I fancy the English lady and her horses, will be the
subject of their fire-side conver∣sation for some time—</P>
<P>The next day I passed the Taillamanta, a river which had torn
and washed away the road for nine miles before I came to it; so I travelled
in a bed of gravel, every now and then jumping into and out of a little ditch
formed by the different torrents. The river was frightful to pass. I got to
San Daniello, from which place, this new road is called the San Daniello road;
from thence <PB N="139" REF="147"/> to Pontiebba, the road is good; but winds
round rocks according to the turns of a ri∣ver, which was sometimes on the
right, sometimes on the left, in a most beautiful manner. It is so
narrow, that I think it the most dangerous I ever went, nothing between the
precipice and the carriage to prevent an accident. It would be well worth any
person's while, who is as fond of the beauties of nature as I am, to ride
along this road. The views are romantic and majestic beyond
description—</P>
<P>Trevisa, which is the place I next slept at, I arrived at with
much difficulty; my coach drawn with ten horses and four oxen; and you can
form to yourself no idea of the obstinacy, and provoking phlegm of a
Ger∣man postillion or postmaster. At one place, tired of the snail-like
pace I went, I hired a traineau of a peasant, and went on before my carriage.
It seems there is an order at every frontier town in Germany, not to suffer
strangers who travel without post∣horses, to leave the town without
staying in it two hours; this the German post-mas∣ter 
<PB N="140" REF="148"/> did not choose to tell me, nor did he re∣fuse me
another traineau and horses, but sat with two other fat Germans playing at
cards, without deigning to give me any other an∣swer
than—<HI>Patienza,</HI> to any thing I could say to him. When I
recollect the scene of these three fat men playing at cards, their figures,
and all I said in Italian to persuade the man and his <HI>patienza</HI> I
could die with laughing; however, in about an hour, an officer came in, who
looking at me some time, said, <HI>Parles vous Francais?—Mon Dieu,
oui Monsieur,</HI> says I; and I found, the post-master's deafness
proceeded from his not being able to talk Italian very well, French not at all;
so he took me for an im∣patient boy, and sent me to Coventry. When the
gentleman called me <HI>Miladi,</HI> these three fat Germans deigned to look
at me; for I must tell you that in this coun∣try, the respect paid to our
sex is such, that it is enough for a woman to speak, she is obeyed
immediately; and I had a traineau, and six horses for my coach ready in an
in∣stant. One night I slept at Klagenfurt, a large town, where one of the
Emperor's <PB N="141" REF="149"/> unmarried sisters lives. I am arrived here
at last, through a very beautiful country; but must observe, that whoever
wrote L. M—'s Letters (for she never wrote a line of them)
misrepresents things most terribly; I do really believe, in most things
they wished to impose upon the credulity of their readers, and laugh at
them. The stoves of this country, which she praises so much, are the
most horrid invention you can conceive. The country people in Ger∣many seem
to fear the cold very much; the casements of their windows are double; and
there being no chimney in the rooms, there is no vent for fumes of any sort,
so that the breath of the inhabitants of them rests in drops of steam on
all the tables, &amp;c. and the stink and suffocating heat that
as∣sails the traveller's senses when he enters any room, particularly
where people are, cannot be conceived. I do not believe the German women, of
the lower order, are very gentle tempers; for several of them flew into the
most violent passions, when I opened a door or window, and shut them
again immediately. My only resource upon <PB N="142" REF="150"/> these
occasions was to go out into the yard—</P>
<P>As to the stoves being ornamental; I think they are frightful from
the compositi∣on of them, the ground work of which must be iron to
resist the fire within; the glaz∣ing, painting, and varnish soon
moulder off; and I leave you to judge, from this in∣evitable circumstance,
together with ano∣ther, which is the size of them, how it is possible
they can represent either China jars or any other thing that may be elegant
or pretty, as a stove fills up one corner of the room—</P>
<P>In this town, several of the first houses have fine
comfortable chimnies, and stoves are, where they should be—in the
anti∣chamber. The difference of the chearful∣ness which a good fire gives to
a room, to that which reigns in one where there is only a stove, is very
visible. I think things must be very much altered since that lady or
gentleman wrote about Vienna. The German ladies are handsome, accomplished,
<PB N="143" REF="151"/> and civil to a degree you have no idea of; several of
them, besides possessing many other languages, read, write, and
speak English well; and I was surprised to find my connections, and
other circumstances flattering to my pride, better known here than they are
by half my acquaintances in London—</P>
<P>Most of the Germans are naturally musi∣cians, and I am sure a
young Englishman, with good manners, may every evening here pass his hours
in a circle of handsome and accomplished women of the first rank. I have
seen no place yet I should so much wish my son to come to as Vienna.
Sir Robert Keith assures me he has presented above four hundred noblemen
and gentle∣men, young countrymen of mine, and has never had reason to
complain of them, while we hear and see constantly the follies of the
<HI>Anglais</HI> at Paris, where they go to ruin themselves, equally with the

<OPENER><DATELINE>VIENNA, 
<DATE>Dec. 15, 1785.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Went with Madame Granieri, the Sar∣dinian Minister's wife, to
court. Nothing is more striking, I think, than the variety of the officers
dresses in the Emperor's anti-chamber. The Hungarian and Polish I think
beautiful, and I now am strengthen∣ed in the opinion I always had, though
pro∣bably I have never told it, even to you, that every nation ought to
preserve the fashion of their country, and that there is no necessity
for mankind to ape one ano∣ther in dress—</P>
<P>The Emperor gives a private audi∣ence for ladies that are
presented to him. There was only myself and the lady who accompanied me
that went into his room together; we met a Princess Ester∣hazi coming out.
The Emperor was close <PB N="147" REF="155"/> to the door; and after bowing
very civilly, he made us sit upon a sofa, and stood the whole time
himself; I staid three quarters of an hour; there is no occasion to fear
staying too long; for when he cannot spare any more for the audience, or
for any other reason chooses to end it, he very ci∣villy says, he will
detain you no longer; you then get up, and go to the door, which he opens
himself, and thus ends the presen∣tation, I think much more agreeably than
to answer any questions a Sovereign chooses to make before a hundred
people that are within hearing in the circle of a drawing-room, who generally
repeat what they hear, according to the folly or malice they pos∣sess;
and I should think it totally impossible for a monarch to converse with
any satisfac∣tion surrounded by so many ears, which have often no brains
belonging to them. The Emperor is like the Queen of France, and the only thing
that <HI>genéd</HI> me at was his not being seated. He converses
politely and agreeably—</P>
<P><PB N="148" REF="156"/> The first minister here, Prince
Kaunitz—is a very extraordinary personage; he is reckoned an able
minister and a good pa∣triot; I see in him all that sincerity<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and frankness which are the
constant attendants on a mind truly great—and I believe the we fare of
the people at large is his delight; for he asked me what I thought of Vienna;
I told him that I had not time to make many observations, but that there was
an air of plenty and comfort among the lower sort of people very striking;
<HI>meme les vendeuses de pommes out l'air aise, mon Prince;</HI> on my
saying this, there was a smile upon his coun∣tenance, which I am sure
came from his heart; and he condescendingly told me se∣veral particulars
relative to the markets and provisions, one of which I cannot help thinking
very necessary in all large cities, which is, that there is an inspector
for the garden-stuff—another for meat—and so on, for all
provisions exposed to sale; and if they are not found perfectly good they
are fiung away. And now we are upon the subject of provisions, I must
say, that I never saw such a profusion of things, and 
<PB N="149" REF="157"/> those so excellent in their kind, as are served up
at the tables here. Green peas, artichokes, and asparagus, I eat every day.
The crawfish are as large as the Chichester lobsters; and the pheasants
from Bohemia have a flavour you can form no idea of. Yet I do not think the
people are <HI>gourmands;</HI> but they pique themselves on having the
greatest abundance and the best sort of eat∣ables of every kind. The
forests and rivers of this country do not in a small degree contribute to
the possibility of these things; for with us, our cooks cannot produce
wild boar and venison, <HI>gelinottes,</HI> and <HI>coqs de bruyeres;</HI> or
crawfish as big as lobsters—</P>
<P>There is one thing here that shocks me and that is, that every
lower class of wo∣men paint white; and even girls of ten years old going of
errands in the street are painted. What their reason for so doing is I
cannot guess; for the Germans are gene∣rally fair. I dine very often with
Prince Kaunitz; and as I am naturally as sincere as he is, our
conversations do not grow languid. There is nothing that ever did 
<PB N="150" REF="158"/> really flatter me so much, as when people of his age
and experience forget for half an hour, the distance which time and
know∣ledge must naturally put between us; and as I have often been rallied by
—, upon my taste for old beaus, I think I am justi∣fied in his eyes,
when I place him at the head of them, and say I am proud they should lose
their time with me; while, I confess, I hate the conversation of boys.</P>
<P>There are great assemblies here as in London; and I repeat it,
there are women here with whom I could pass my life. They have not the cold
silent reserve of English women, nor the impertinent
<HI>interêt</HI> for me, of the French ladies—</P>
<P>The public works (such as sweeping the streets, &amp;c.
&amp;c.) are done by malefactors, who, chained two and two, perform their
task attended by a guard—</P>
<P>The Emperor has given up a park called the Prater, to the public,
where the <HI>bour∣geoise</HI> and <HI>noblesse</HI> ride, drive, and
walk; <PB N="151" REF="159"/> and have little cottages, where refreshments are
sold. It has many fine trees in it, and the Danube is one of its fences; it
is very like an English park—</P>
<P>I have been to see the pictures in the house that was formerly
Prince Eugene's, now the Emperor's, and many things of which I have neither
time nor inclination to give you a description — and there are so
many Englishmen here, that, when I am at Sir Robert Keith's, I am half
tempted to fancy myself in Eng∣land—</P>

<P>I Got away as fast as I possibly could from Vienna; for if I
had staid a week longer, I am convinced I should have staid the whole
winter. The country between Vienna and Cracow is very fine; chiefly open, here
and there the plain beautifully varied with hills of gentle ascent, and
small woods; the sportsman and the painter would be pleased with it, as
it affords a variety of landscapes and game, equally favourable to both. The
firs and deciduous trees do not seem to flourish in the same spot; I
frequently saw a wood of the one to my right, and of the other to my left; I
observed, that cattle of all sorts are suffered to eat the green corn
during the hard weather—</P>
<P><PB N="154" REF="162"/> The herdsman with his cows, and the
shepherd with his sheep, gave living beau∣ties to the fine features of
nature, whose graces I have studied with much satisfaction to myself,
when very young, pointed out by Mr. Brown, who certainly never learnt their
value in the gardens of my an∣cestors—</P>
<P>I slept the first night at Nicolsbourg, a small town, six
posts, or sixty miles from the capital; the next at Brun, a neat for∣tified
town, commanded by a fort, and steep hill west of the city, that is watered
by a branch of the river Thaja, which stream, a few miles lower, mixes with
the river Mash, at a short distance west of Pres∣burgh, and by
uniting afterwards with the Danube, adds considerably to the rapidity of that
river.</P>
<P>Most of the villages are situated under the shelter of hills;
the houses are chiefly built of logs of the fir-trees, laid horizon∣tally
upon one another, the interstices filled <PB N="155" REF="163"/> up with
moss or clay. The road from Brun to Olmutz is bordered with large old
cherry-trees. After quitting Olmutz, I passed a large convent on the plain
to the left; this and the <HI>Chartreuse reformée</HI> to the right,
make two fine objects for tra∣vellers.</P>

<P>THE entrance into the town of Cracow exhibits a melancholy proof
that confusion ever ends in ruin. The system of govern∣ment in Poland is
of all others the surest source of confusion that ever yet was imagined
by mankind; an elected King from the noble families, most of which think they
have a right to royalty, and several really are en∣titled to it —</P>
<P>I think, Sir, had I been born a Polish nobleman, rather than have
seen my exten∣sive country divided between ambitious neighbours, I would
have called my coun∣trymen together, proposed to have relin∣quished (for us
and for our heirs for ever) that unfortunate privilege; have invited some
spirited prince from Germa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> in 
<PB N="157" REF="165"/> whom hereditary courage and all the virtues belonging to
a good soldier were blended, and made him and his descendants the law∣ful
Sovereigns of this kingdom—</P>
<P>Dirty suburbs filled with Jews; and the Emperor's eagle, are the
only objects that precede the gates of Cracow; these gates are pierced by
many a ball, and probably, if each bore the name of his sender, the gateway
might be divided into as many pieces for those who have claims to it, as
Poland herself is divided into parties; I had letters for several Polish
ladies at Cracow, but I staid only to rest myself, and get a traineau
made; for I was told I might go thus, but a couple of miles from the town I was
obliged to take my coach off the sledge; and here I must observe, Sir,
that the Prince Galitzin at Vienna, was very much mistaken, when he told me,
he should advise me to have just such a coach as mine made if I were
not already mistress of such a one—</P>
<P>I hung more than once upon fir-trees; the track of the road being
too narrow for <PB N="153" REF="166"/> my wide carriage; and when travellers
come into Germany, I think they ought to part with their French and English
carriages, as the carriages of our northern countries are liable to
inconveniencies and accidents—</P>
<P>I staid two hours one night, so fastened with the hind-wheel
upon a fir-tree, that six men could not stir it, and peasants were called
to cut down the tree, before I could proceed—</P>
<P>I shall refer you to Mr. Coxe's book for the accommodations I met
with on the road, and confine my descriptions to agreeable
circumstances—</P>
<P>When I arrived at Warsaw, I found my apartments had been warmed
and ready two days before my arrival; the Comte de Stackelberg having bespoke
them, by the desire of Prince Galitzin, and the Russian Minister
C— de S— waited on me. The King received us in his study; I was
accompanied by the Grand Marechal's <PB N="159" REF="167"/> wife, who is one of
the King's nieces—You, Sir, do not speak better French and Eng∣lish
than that amiable Sovereign; he told me he had been in England thirty years
past, and asked me if Mr. W— was still living? not only living I
replied, Sir; but in good spirits; for I have a charming letter in my pocket
from him—He said, if there was nothing imprudent in his request, he
would ask to see it. He imagined Mr. W's stile must be uncommon; I gave
him the letter, he put it into his pocket after reading it, and told me, as his
sister, the Princess of Cracovia did not understand English, he
should translate it into French for her; and if I would dine with him two
days after, he would read me his translati∣on, which indeed surprized me;
he must be a very elegant writer in every language he chooses to profess;
I wish I had dared to have asked him for a copy. Well, Sir, he is the
second person I have seen, whom I wished were not sovereigns, for it
is impos∣sible that the many disagreeable persons and circumstances,
that surround them, should <PB N="160" REF="168"/> not deprive them of the
society of people who, sacrificing only to the Muses, are better company
than those who only sacri∣fice to ambition, when they give their time to
sovereigns. We were only fourteen people at the King's dinner, and we
con∣versed as chearfully and as rationally as if we had not been at
court—</P>
<P>The King, in his face, is very like the Duke of Marlborough, and
there is an ele∣gance in his language, with a softness in the tone of his
voice, that pleases the ear to the highest degree. My old acquaintance, the
princess C—, will be the occasion of my shortening my stay here;
for it is many years since I saw her, and as she does not come here on
account — I shall give her the meeting in the country, and afterwards
set out for Petersburgh. I told the King I should see her, as he
spoke to me of her: I hate party affairs—and —</P>
<P><PB N="161" REF="169"/> I make visits in a new stile here, in the
Comte de Stackelberg's coach and six, and a couple of equerries at the two
coach win∣dows on horseback. The Polish ladies seem to have much taste,
magnificence, spirit and gaiety; they are polite and lively, ex∣cessively
accomplished, partial to the Eng∣lish. There is a Princess de Radzivil,
who, if I were a man, I should certainly be de∣voted to—I could be very
happy here, Sir, if my heart could forget maternal duties, or those of
friendship —</P>
<P>I have seen several dwarfs here, who with equerries stand in
drawing-rooms of the great houses, and hear all the conver∣sation that
passes, an uncomfortable custom I think; and which in any other country
would be dangerous; but here servants and dependants are the absolute
property of the master—and their fidelity in general is equal to their
subjection; to the credit of the Polish nobles, I believe there are few
ser∣vants that, having proved for eight or ten <PB N="162" REF="170"/> years
their attachment, are not dismissed with a pension for life. I found
the French maid, the Princess C— had from me, in this situation; nine
years service had ob∣tained a hundred pounds a year, and a farm of sixty
acres of land for the rest of her life; she seems the happiest creature
in the world. The King has a manner of saying things obliging or flattering,
pecu∣liar to himself; he tells me he thinks men, animals, trees, every thing
in short, that takes its birth or is produced by England, is more perfect
than the produce of other countries; the climate, the soil probably, he
says, may occasion this; his partiality to the English, together with
your's, Sir, would make me prejudiced in favour of my own country, if I could
love it better than I do; but the word comfort which is under∣stood there
only, has long stamped the value of it in my mind—</P>
<P>I am going to see the Princess to-mor∣row, and am sorry to
quit this place so soon; not that there is any thing in this flat 
<PB N="163" REF="171"/> country that would tempt me to see the beauties of it
in the spring, but the King's acquaintance, with that of some of the
ladies, and monsieur de Stackelberg's con∣versation, I am sorry to
quit—</P>

<P>THE road between Warsaw and this place is one insipid flat,
except just in and about the town of Nerva, where I took a sledge and flew
hither. When I wrote last, dear Sir, I think I was upon the point of going to
see the Princess C—, I passed two days with her at a country
house of the Princess Lubomirska's, her sister-in-law; I was most
sincerely glad to see her, and we parted with regret. I received a very
civil message from the King, and M. de Stackel∣berg sent me six bottles
of bishop, which I can assure you was very serviceable to me; I did not
stop at Warsaw on my re∣turn from the P—, and the messenger
caught me just one post on this side of Warsaw; I can conceive nothing
so <HI>enuyant</HI> as travelling in such a country as this, one 
<PB N="165" REF="173"/> flat plain; the view terminated by a forest, which you
drive through, only to arrive at the same scene you have quitted, the
frost was not hard enough to make the road good, till I came to Nerva. I am
something like a country Miss, gaping at the window all day here, every
creature that goes about the streets, seem as if they were in a violent
hurry, they drize full gallop, traineaus with one horse ply at the corners of
the streets as do your hackney-coaches and chairs. Mr. S— informed me,
it belonged to my dignity to have six horses to my coach, in order to pay
my visits; and I beg you will imagine my surprise, when I found I had a
coachman on the box, with three postil∣lions, one to each pair of horses;
and these sitting on the right hand, I go thus, full gallop, running races
with every other <HI>attelage</HI> that falls in my way; the streets are

<P>I Was to have been presented to the Em∣press next Sunday, but
she graciously sent me word to come to the Hermitage on Thursday, where
she keeps her court in the evening every week; and has alternate∣ly a French
play or an Italian opera—Marchesini and Madame Todi are the first
singers. It is but justice to say, that no∣thing can be more magnificent
than the appearance the Empress makes when she comes into the drawing-room;
she has a lively and good-humoured look, and her politeness to me was very
great; but I could plainly see that some one had told her I was not an
English woman, for she asked me if I was not of a Scotch family. I
can∣not conceive why this building which she has added to the palace is
called the Hermi∣tage; <PB N="167" REF="175"/> it is a long suite of rooms,
full of fine pictures. You are not ignorant, dear Sir, of the many collections
the Empress has purchased; among the rest Lord Orford's; all these fine
works want at present, a per∣son to arrange them according to their
shades and size, and I doubt not but the Empress will find one—</P>
<P>Petersburgh is a chearful and fine looking town; the streets are
extremely wide and long, the houses stucco'd to imitate white stone; none
above three stories high, which certainly adds to the lively and airy
appear∣ance of them; I think, Sir, if a young woman may permit herself to
judge of things otherwise than <HI>en detail</HI>—that not only the
town, but the manner of living is upon too large a a scale; the nobles seem
to vie with one another in extravagancies of every sort, particularly in
foreign luxuries and fashion. The fashion of the day is most ridiculous
and improper for this cli∣mate; French gauzes and flowers were not intended for
Russian beauties, and they are sold at a price here which must ruin the
buyers.</P>
<P><PB N="168" REF="176"/> There are buildings erected for the
re∣ception of Arts and Sciences of every kind; for artists or amateurs,
though but the sur∣plus of Italy, France, and England, would find handsome
encouragement and house∣room from the Empress, whose respect for
talents, and generosity to those who possess them, have induced
some, and would many more, to fix in the present capital of this vast
empire; but, alas! Sir, eight months of winter, and the horrid cold I feel,
must congeal the warmest imagination; poets and painters require verdant
lawns; and the flowers of fancy must fade and die, where spring is not to
be found—</P>
<P>The Empress and the Princess d'Ashkow are the only ladies who
wear the Russian dress; it is I think a very handsome one; and I am
more surprised every day, that nations do not each preserve their own
fashions, and not copy one country that is at present only the ape of every
other—From Cherson, the new town on the Tur∣kish frontiers, which is
one thousand six hundred miles from hence, are brought 
<PB N="169" REF="177"/> many provisions; from Archangel likewise this town
is provided, and from Astracan on the Caspian Sea, near two thousand
miles, all the dainties, such as grapes, pease, beans, artichokes, are
brought. It is na∣tural to suppose, that the necessaries of life are
dear, from these circumstances; but some of them are extremely cheap, and
I believe Russia is one of the cheapest coun∣tries in the world to live
in; if French wines and fashions, and English comforts can be dispensed
with. To these last I never felt so much attachment as at this
moment—<HI>Dans le Ligne Anglais,</HI> a quarter of this town, where the
English merchants live, I find English grates, English coals, and
English hospitality, to make me wel∣come, and the fire-side chearful; I
have never yet been fortunate enough to make any acquaintance in the world of
com∣merce; but if all English merchants and their families are as well
informed and civil as those I find here; I should be very glad to be
admitted into the city of London as a visitor, to enjoy a little rational
conversa∣tion, which at the court-end is seldom to <PB N="170" REF="178"/>
be found. How should it be otherwise? A little Latin and Greek in the
schools of Westminister and Eton, and a great deal of vulgar rioting,
make our young men a strange mixture of pedantism and vice, which can only
produce impudence and folly. Thus tutored, at sixteen they are turned upon
the hands of some unhappy man, who is to present them at foreign courts,
with no other improvement or alte∣ration in the boys heads, than that of their
hair being powdered and tied behind—</P>
<P>The careful citizen, conscious that fair dealing and knowledge
only can promote the well-being of his family, brings up his son to
business, and that only, as you know well, makes the idle moments of life
happy. Peter the First thought commerce an essen∣tial pillar to his
empire, and the English trader was encouraged; our little island is a proof
of the consequence which trade alone can give any country; and the new
ac∣quired possessions of the largest empires may only become
additional trouble to their masters, unless the advantages of trade give
them new life—</P>
<P><PB N="171" REF="179"/> The French Ambassador, and the Comte
Sergé de Romanzow (named to Berlin) are men of wit. Mr. Ellis is with
Mr. Fitzher∣bert; and conversation does not languish or grow insipid in
their company. We are in the last part of the carnival and balls; those
given by the Ambassadors are very superb. Mr. de Segur, and the Duc de
Serra Capriola, the Neapolitan Minister, have each given one in a very
magnificent style—</P>
<P>I was presented to the Grand Duchess the same night that I
waited upon the Em∣press; she has since been brought to bed. There are
some young Russian ladies very pretty and much accomplished; many of
them sigh after a different climate from their own, and — told me he
had no idea of happiness in the world like that of re∣turning to England as a
private man, and purchasing a farm; he speaks very good English. Indeed,
Sir, the elegance which is produced by the cleanliness and order seen with
us, is found no where out of England; here the houses are decorated 
<PB N="172" REF="180"/> with the most sumptuous furniture from every
country; but you come into a draw∣ing-room, where the floor is of the finest
inlaid woods, through a staircase made of the coarsest wood in the
rudest man∣ner, and stinking dirt—The postillions wear
sheep-skins; and at a ball, when a nobleman has proposed his hand to a
fair lady, he often kisses her before the whole company—<HI>à

propos</HI> to this custom—I must tell you an anecdote of —</P>
<P>Thus you perceive he was nearly in the same predicament as the
Chevalier dans la Fée Urgele, and might have said, <HI>pour un
baiser faut-il perdre la vie?</HI></P>
<P>Adieu, Sir—I will give you some ac∣count in my next of what
I have seen at the Museum—</P>
<P>You may have heard much of Prince Potemkin; I see him every where,
but he is reserved and converses very little with ladies. I was invited by
him to dine in an <PB N="173" REF="181"/> immense palace he is building in the
sub∣urbs; the only room finished is too particu∣lar not to be described;
it is three hundred feet in length, and on the side opposite the windows
there are two rows of stone pillars, whose height and breadth are
proportioned to the immense size of the room, which is an oblong square;
in the centre of which on the side where the windows are, it is formed into a
semi-circle or what we call a bow—which bow forms another large space
independent of, though in the room; this space was laid out by his English
gardener into a shrubbery, with borders of flowers, hyacinths, and
narcissuses—myrtles, orange-trees, &amp;c. &amp;c. were in plenty.
We were seven or eight ladies, and as many men—immense stoves
concealed by the pillars, were heated in order to make such a hall in such
a climate supportable—but I came home quite ill with cold. It was there
I heard that extraordinary music performed by men and boys, each blowing a
straight horn adapted to their size—sixty-five of these
musicians produce a very harmonious melody, something like an immense
organ. <PB N="174" REF="182"/> The music, the room, the cold, all was
gi∣gantic I sat by Prince Potemkin at din∣ner; but except asking me to eat
and drink, I cannot say I heard the sound of his voice; so am unable to
tell you what species of <HI>es∣prit</HI> has raised him to the fortunes
and dig∣nities he possesses, or what occasions Mr. S— and
others to call him a sensible man—</P>
<P>I have seen likewise the cabinet of medals and the Museum
here<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A complete set of harness made of white
leather, stitch∣ed with coloured silks, for six dogs, with a sledge for
one person, brought from Kamskatka, was the lightest, neatest, and
most curious piece of workmanship I ever saw.</NOTE>; the last when
fi∣nished, will be a very beautiful suite of rooms. Peter the Great
likewise sitting in a chair, with a coat of his amiable Catha∣rine's
embroidery. I cannot help thinking, and often here, that notwithstanding he
transferred his capital to this place, and that the Empress, Prince Potemkin,
and others, may build palaces of the finest orders of architecture, to
contain the produce of learning and commerce, that a time will 
<PB N="175" REF="183"/> come when the heads of an empire, which extends from the
South to the North, will prefer basking in the rays of the sun, which chear
the mind and the body together—to eternal frost—and these
stately buildings will be turned into storehouses—<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></P>
<P>Justice obliges me to say, the Empress does all she can to
invite politeness, science, and comsorts from other countries, to cheer
these regions of ice—but, until she can alter the climate, I believe
it is a fruitless trial. I am informed the spring, or rather the time of
the year we call spring, is more melan∣choly than winter here, so I shall
hasten my departure; but a conversation I had with the Swedish
Minister, a few days past, will make me give up entirely the thoughts of
returning into Germany through Sweden and Denmark. I shall in my next have
the honour of repeating it to you; I remain with the highest respect and

<P>Où il serait dangereux que la glace se

</SP> 
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M—</SPEAKER>
<P>Comme je n'ai jamais commencé un voyage pour
retourner sur mes pas, et qu'il me sem∣ble que je cours risque
d'être enfant perdu moi-même, si j'entreprens ce voyage, je
re∣mettrai ma visite à votre pays pour une au∣tre occasion,
Monsieur l'Ambassadeur; <HI>and so we talked of other
things—</HI></P>
</SP></Q></P>
<P>I shall now prepare every thing to visit the Crimea or rather
the Tauride; I have been told it is a very beautiful country; and I confess I
am not sorry this <HI>enfant perdu</HI> gives me a good excuse for turning
my steps towards Constantinople—</P>
<P><PB N="178" REF="186"/> There are ladies here whom I shall be
sorry to quit; who in youth are possessed of many talents, and with
whom I could form an agreeable society; Italian music, the pedal harp, and
our English poets are perfectly understood by them; I think often I can
trace Grecian features among the fe∣males of this country, and the subtle wit
of the Greek in the men: that pliability of genius which causes them to
speak so many different languages well, and adopt all the inventions and
arts of other countries that are good—</P>
<P>I am speaking without any partiality, dear Sir; but I do not
see here the preju∣dices of the English, the conceit of the French, nor the
stiff German pride, which national foibles make often good people of each
nation extremely disagreeable. I am assured the Russians are
deceitful—it may be so; but as I do not desire to have inti∣macies, I
am much better pleased to find new acquaintances pleasant and civil than
morose or pert—</P>
<P><PB N="179" REF="187"/> Mine at present is a geographical
inter∣course with the world; and I like to find the road I travel smooth.
Wit and talents will always be objects of importance to me; I have found them
here, and shall be sorry to quit them. Prince Repnin and his ne∣phew Prince
Kourakin, whom I often saw in England, are both here, and I look upon them as
old acquaintances, as it is thirteen years since that period. The latter is
grown fat.</P>
<P>I forgot to tell you. Sir, that the Grand Duchess was brought to
bed five days after my arrival; so I have only seen her the night I was
presented to her, which was the same on which I was presented to the
Empress; her affability is great to strangers; for Mr. S— had not
announced me to her; but seeing me move from one seat to another at the
opera, by the Empress's desire, and probably being informed who I was,
she sent for me to come to her after the specta∣cle—which I did. A
most ridiculous thing happened to me; for though I had no less than three
carriages as I thought waiting for <PB N="180" REF="188"/> me, I was above an
hour getting at one, owing to the great distance of the Grand Duchess's
apartments from the Hermitage, where the theatre is—and Mr. S—'s
telling me he waited for me at the Hermi∣tage. I went three times through the
whole palace, and while I was at one door, two of the carriages were at the
other. Prince Kourakin, who had offered to conduct me back to the Hermitage
from the Grand Du∣chess, and who was engaged to sup with the Grand Duke,
was not a little embarrassed; for the doors, opened to let in company, were
shut; and I had no other resource but to sit in the guard-room of the
Duchess, till Prince Kourakin's servant should find one of the carriages
belonging either to me or my party. The Prince went in to sup, but the Grand
Duchess hearing this circumstance sent me a very fine pelisse, which
I told the Prince I really did not want; but he in∣formed me I must put it
on, so I did; and in a few minutes I had a carriage; but the most
ridiculous circumstance was, that the Saxon Minister's wife, whom I had
come to court with, thought I was gone home <PB N="181" REF="189"/> in my own
carriage—the company in that, thought I was gone home with her, and gave
me up, after having paraded on the outside of the palace from door to door,
as I had on the inside. My servants at home I thought I had been invited to
sup at the palace—</P>
<P>The Grand Duchess is fair and tall; the Duchess of Wirtemberg,
who is the Duchess of Brunswick's daughter, is pretty, and very like our
royal family—she was very ci∣vil to me—I have not seen the
Grand Duchess's children—I am told they are fine and healthy—</P>
<P>Adieu, Sir, for the present. I remain your's, with great
respect and truth—</P>
</POSTSCRIPT><POSTSCRIPT>
<P><HI>P. S.</HI> I am not a little surprised to hear people
say: I shall inherit so many hundred peasants, or such a one lost a
village—it is the number of men, and not of acres, that make a fortune
great here; so that a plague or any distemper that would prove mortal to
the peasants, would be death to the no∣bles pockets likewise—</P>
<P><PB N="182" REF="190"/> I have taken leave of the Empress, and
you may judge if I do not leave Petersburgh with a good impression of her
politeness; she told me before the opera, that she knew my intention; but
as we defer disagreeable things as long as possible, you shall not take
leave till after the spectacle; these words she said with the most
gracious smile; and asked me if I was satisfied with the amuse∣ments
and civilities I met with. I told her I must be both stupid and ungrateful,
not to regret infinitely, that I could not stay any longer, to shew how
sensible I was of the hospitality and magnificence with which I was
treated. The Vicechancellor, Comte d'Ofterman, is obliged to have a table for
sixty foreigners every Wednesday; and a widow Princess de Galitzin, a
supper once a week—at Mons. d'Osterman's too, a ball every Sunday
night. The Empress is at the expence of these dinners and suppers; and I
confess, I think it an excellent and royal idea, to be certain of having
houses open for the entertainment of foreign ministers and strangers of
distinction; for you know, my dear Sir, that private houses are seldom 
<PB N="183" REF="191"/> open to strangers now in most coun∣tries, for
various reasons. Here I am told there are many Princes who keep a public day,
as we do in England, for the conveni∣ence of our country neighbours, and expect
people whom they leave a card with, to dine with them upon such a day; but,
if I was to stay here ten years, I should never be prevailed upon to go to
those houses to dine without invitation; nor can I believe it possible
the masters of them can expect a foreigner to grace their table, without
being desired even by word of mouth. I am as∣sured I shall affront
— and — but as I meet them every where, I cannot think they
should be so totally ignorant of the manners of other countries, to expect
me to dine at their house without asking me. There is a custom here which
I think very abominable; noblemen, who are engaged to marry young ladies, make
no ceremony, but embrace them in the midst of a large company at a
ball—</P>
<P>I have mentioned to a few people my in∣tention of seeing the
Crimea; and I am told <PB N="184" REF="192"/> that the air is unwholesome, the
waters poi∣sonous, and that I shall certainly die if I go there; but as in
the great world a new ac∣quired country, like a new beauty, finds detractors, I
am not in the least alarmed; for a person, not a Russian, who has been
there on speculation, has given me so charm∣ing a description of it, that
I should not be sorry to purchase a Tartarian estate.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXXIV.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>MOSCOW, 
<DATE>Feb. 29, 1786.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Left my coach at Petersburgh, and hi∣red for myself and my
small suite, the car∣riages of the country, called Kibitkas; they are
exactly like cradles, the head having windows to the front which let down; I
can sit or lie down, and feel in one like a great child, very comfortably
defended from the cold by pillows and blankets. These car∣riages are upon
sledges, and where the road is good, this conveyance is comforta∣ble and not
fatiguing; but from the incre∣dible quantity of sledges that go constantly
upon the track of snow, it is worn in tracks like a road; and from the
shaking and vio∣lent thumps the carriage receives, I am con∣vinced the
hardest head might be broken. I was overturned twice; the postillions I
fancy are used to such accidents; for they <PB N="186" REF="194"/> get
quietly off their horse, set the carriage up again, and never ask if the
traveller is hurt. Their method of driving is singu∣lar: they sit behind
three horses that are harnessed abreast—a shrill whistling
noise, or a savage kind of shriek is the signal for the horses to
set off, which they do full gal∣lop; and when their pace slackens, the
dri∣ver waves his right-hand, shrieks or whistles, and the horses obey. I
am told the whip is unmercifully used in the stables; I ob∣served a
postillion never strikes a horse in driving; which caused my
astonishment at their being so tractable to the raising of a hand only.
I would never advise a travel∣ler to set out from Petersburgh as I have,
just at the end of the carnival; he might with some reason suppose it
is a religious duty for the Russian peasant to be drunk; in most
villages I saw a sledge loaded with young men and women in such a manner,
that four horses would have been more pro∣per to draw it than one, which
wretched beast was obliged to fly with this noisy company up and down the
village, which is generally composed of houses in straight 
<PB N="187" REF="195"/> rows on each side of the public road. The girls are
dressed in their holiday-clothes, and some are beautiful, and do not look
less so from various coloured handkerchiefs tied over their forehead, in a
becoming and <HI>pittoresque</HI> manner. There is one particular piece of
roguery practised after this diversi∣on upon travellers, which ought to be
put an end to: the horse employed upon these festive occasions is
generally upon the point of death; and the first post-horse that is
wanted, that horse is harnessed to a kibitka in his place, because a
traveller is obliged to pay the value of any horse that dies in his
service. I had one that died thus, though I remonstrated upon his being put
to the collar, seeing that he was dying—but unless I could have armed
six servants with good cudgels, my arguments were as fruitless as those
employed at the next post, to prove how unreasonable it was, that I
should pay a great deal of money for a dead horse, that was dying when he
was put to the car∣riage—</P>
<P><PB N="188" REF="196"/> The Russian peasant is a fine, stout,
straight, well-looking man; some of the women, as I said before, are
uncommonly pretty; but the general whiteness of their teeth is something
that cannot be conceiv∣ed; it frequently happened that all the men of the
village were in a circle round my car∣riages—and rows of the most
beautiful ori∣ental pearl cannot be more regular and white than their teeth. It
is a matter of great astonishment to me, how the infants outlive the
treatment they receive, till they are able to crawl into the air; there is a
kind of space or <HI>entresol</HI> over every stove, in which the
husband, wife, and children lie the greatest part of the day, and where
they sleep at night—the heat appeared to me so great that I have no
conception how they bear it; but they were as much surprised at me for
seeking a door or window in every house I was obliged to go into, as I
could possibly be at their living in a manner with∣out air. The children
look all pale and sickly, till they are five or six years old. The houses
and dresses of the peasants are by no means uncomfortable; the first is
ge∣nerally <PB N="189" REF="197"/> composed of wood, the latter of
sheep-skins; but trees laid horizontally one upon another makes a very
strong wall, and the climate requires a warm skin for cloth∣ing. It might
appear to English minds, that a people who are in a manner the pro∣perty of
their lord, suffer many of the af∣flictions that attend slavery; but the
very circumstance of their persons being the pro∣perty insures them the
indulgence of their master for the preservation of their lives; and that
master stands between them and the power of a despotic government or a
brutal soldiery. Beside, my dear Sir, the invaluable advantage which
these peasants have, as in paying annually a very small sum each, and
cultivating as many acres of land as he thinks fit, his fortune depends
entirely upon his own industry; each man only pays about the value of
half-a-guinea a year. If his lord would raise this tax too high, or make
their vassals suffer; misery and desertion would ruin his fortune,
not theirs; it is true, that a lord is obliged to give one man as a recruit
yearly out of such a number; but it is one out of three or 
<PB N="190" REF="198"/> four hundred; so that notwithstanding this great
empire is said not to be popu∣lated in proportion to the extent of it; when
you reflect what a number of troops the Empress has, and these kept up by
this method; the Russian people must be more numerous than strangers
may imagine, in travelling through this country. It is very amusing to me to
reflect, without prejudices of any kind, upon the ridiculous ideas of liberty
and property that our English com∣mon people have; for —</P>
<P>And now, my most honoured and dear brother, that I have given you
so pretty a picture of English liberty—I shall wish you a good
night, and remain</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXXV.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>MOSCOW, 
<DATE>March 3, 1786.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Believe I have not told you, that I am possessed of all
the instructions to proceed upon this new journey in a very pleasant
manner. The commanders at Krement-chouck and at Cherson are informed of my
intention to proceed to Perekop, where I shall enter into that peninsula
called the Tauride, which, from the climate and situ∣ation, I look upon to be
a delicious coun∣try; and an acquisition to Russia which she should
never relinquish. I must take off your attention, for some time from your
own people and my journey, and, in as few words as possible, shew by
remote and past ages, that the Tauride must naturally become a treasure
to posterity. Long be∣fore Homer, the first inhabitants of it that can be
traced were the Cimmerians; a nu∣merous <PB N="192" REF="200"/> and warlike
people, descendants of the Thracians; in their incursions into Asia
Minor, they were robbed by the Scy∣thians of their possessions, but
preserved the Crimea longer than the rest of them; the Scythians drove them
from the flat country 656 years before Christ; but they remained concealed in
the mountains, calling them∣selves Taourians—and from thence the
pen∣insula took the name of Taourica—Taou∣rinia—or Tauris. The
Greeks began to establish themselves in the sixth century be∣fore
Christ. The Milesians built a town called Panticapoeum or Bosporus, now
called Kierche; and Theodosia, which at present is mostly called Kaffa.
The Em∣press has ordered this town to be restored to the original Greek
name Theodosia; it is at present a town of no inconsiderable com∣merce.
Before I proceed to follow the vari∣ations which the changes, and I may say
mixtures of nations that have governed this country, and have produced the
present an∣nexion of it to Russia, I must observe that, according to
my usual mode of tracing ex∣traordinary appearances to their primitive 
<PB N="193" REF="201"/> causes—I yet think I am perfectly right in
perceiving a lineal descent in many Russians from the Greeks. The
darkness in which we are lost, when we turn back to nations conquered by
savage unlettered people, puts a stop to all certainty as to genealogy; but
when the Greeks by terror and oppres∣sion were driven from Theodosia, and
other towns on the sea—coast—is it not very natu∣ral to
suppose that they wandered, or were driven farther up into the country, and
that by degrees their descendants peopled a country, which nothing but
necessity forced them to inhabit? Many marks of superior genius have
pierced through all the diffi∣culties that ignorance and the climate have
occasioned, and shewn themselves in the Russian peasant, nor
should I wonder to find, if their genius was traced, it descend∣ed from a
Thales or an Alcibiades. Let us return to history—480 years before the
birth of Christ, the people from Mitylene sounded a monarchy in the Crimea,
which was governed forty-two years afterwards by Spartacus. This King and his
successors, we are told, favoured the Greeks, particu∣larly 
<PB N="194" REF="202"/> the Athenians, and drove away the Scythians in a great
measure; but they were entirely exterminated by the Sarmati∣ans. At this
period, the Taourians from the mountains molested the new monarchy, till
Mithridrates, King of Pontus, about 112 years before the birth of Christ
subdued them, and made himself master of the whole peninsula. About the
birth of Christ, the Alains made the Kings, possessors of
Bos∣phorus, his tributaries, and drove away the Taourians. These new
masters held their power about a century and a half. In the second century
the Goths succeeded to the Alains, and it was under their dominion that
Christianity was first introduced into the Crimea. During the lives of
Diocletian and Constantine the Great, bishopricks were created. But the
Goths were obliged to submit to the Huns, and like all other
possessors of the Crimea, when driven from the plains, they, in their
turn, took refuge in the mountains, where they had their own sovereigns, who
were Christians; at that time there remained some of the Alains in the
mountains likewise, and a few were dis∣persed <PB N="195" REF="203"/> over
the plains. About the fourth century, what was called the kingdom of
Bosphorus ceased to exist as a kingdom; the Hungarians entered the Crimea
in 464, they having, with the Bulgarians, all the country between the Don and
the Dneister.</P>
<P>The Goths and Alains went to Taman, where they settled
habitations. The descen∣dants of the Hungarians took the name of
Aoultziagrians, and led a wandering life in the Crimea, but were obliged to
submit to the Khatyares, who made likewise the Goths in the mountains, and
the Grecian towns on the coast, their tributaries. About the eighth century
the Goths attempted a revolt, but were subdued, yet were go∣verned among
themselves by their own Kings. In the year 840, the Emperor Theophilus
erected a government at Cher∣son, to which he subjected all the other towns
of the Crimea and Kouban, for though these countries were tributary to the
Khatyares, they acknowledged the so∣vereignty of the Byzantian court.
Not∣withstanding <PB N="196" REF="204"/> this, from the time the Khat∣yares
had first conquered the Crimea, that peninsula had taken the name of Khat,
or Gatyaria, except the mountainous part, which was called Gothia, from the
Goths, and Tsikia, from the remaining Alains—Jews were then numerous in
the Crimea—</P>
<P>The Petchenegues or Kanglis, in 882, drove the Hungarians from the
Crimea; but beyond the Isthmus of Or, remained two detached branches of
Bulgarians and Hungarians, known in the annals of Russia by the name of
Berendec, or Black Bul∣garians; from this period the Khatyares preserved no
power but in Asia, where it was likewise annihilated in 1015; yet even then
the Crimea preserved the name of Khatyaria—</P>
<P>About the eleventh century, the Petche∣negues were obliged to give
up that peninsula and most of their possessions to the Ko∣manes,
otherwise called Butyes or Polouzes, who likewise subdued the Goths and
Greeks that were left in it. At this period of time the town of Sougdaia, now
called Soudak, <PB N="197" REF="205"/> became so considerable from the
commerce and trade carried on there, that all the land possessed by the
Greeks in the Crimea was called after it Soudak—</P>
<P>Till the year 1204 they acknowledged the sovereignty of the
Byzantian empire; but then they made themselves indepen∣dent, or submitted
to the power of different princes, so that when the Ottomans con∣quered that
country, there existed two principalities, one called Theodor, now Inkerman;
and the other Gothia, now called Mangoute. In 1237, the Polouzes were subdued
in the Crimea by the Mon∣gouls or Tartars, who were governed in clans by their
princes, by the titles of Ouloug Beigh, in the plains, till Menguelci-Ghierai
converted the Crimea into a kind of state. The Goths and Greeks paid a
tribute to the Mongouls, as they had be∣fore to the Polouzes. In the first
part of the Tartarian reign, a number of Tcher, Kafes or Circassians,
established themselves in the Crimea in 1333; that part called Kierche
was governed by a Prince of that <PB N="198" REF="206"/> nation; and, as the
Tartars carried on a great trade in the town of Krim, the pen∣insula took the
name of Krim, by which only it is known to the Orientals at this hour. While
the Latins were masters of Constantinople, they carried on a
conside∣rable trade at Krim, Tamane, and Tana; the most considerable
traders were the Ve∣netians. But when the Genoese, by a treaty with the
Emperor Michael Paleologus, had obtained an exemption of all duties in the
Grecian states, and a free navigation in the Black Sea, they began to
monopolife all the trade of the Crimea; bloody wars en∣sued, in which they
were almost constantly victorious. They rebuilt, with the consent of the
Mongoul Khan, the town of Kaffa; made it the chief repository or capital of
their commerce, and at last of such conse∣quence, that Kaffa, for a time,
was the name by which the peninsula was called. By degrees they conquered
Soudak, and Cembals, now called Balouklava; it is true, they paid a tribute to
the Mongouls, while these preserved their power; but when their own
intestine divisions had weakened <PB N="199" REF="207"/> it, the Genoese
shook off their yoke, and the Mongoulian or Tartarian Princes were elected or
deposed as the Genoese thought fit. It was at this period that the trade
from India to the Crimea was divided into two branches by the Amou, the
Caspian Sea, and Astrakan—one ended at Tana; the other proceeded by
Bagdad and Tauris to Trapesond and Savastopolis. Tana be∣longed to the
Genoese and Venetians, un∣der the supremacy of the Mongouls; the Genoese
had their consuls at Traposond and Savastopolis.</P>
<P>In 1575 the Genoese lost their power in the Crimea, by the Turks
having con∣quered Kaffa, Soudak, and Balouklava, and Tana upon the Don. These
new con∣querors put an end to the principalities of the Goths and of Theodori,
established garrisons in all the principal towns upon the coast, and by
that measure checked the power of the Khans of the Crimea; these however,
till the year 1584, were rather the allies than the subjects of the Porte,
till it attained the power of naming them, or <PB N="200" REF="208"/> confirming
their nomination, when they ventured to be chosen without having
pre∣viously obtained the sanction of the Ottoman council—</P>
<P>The Turkish cabinet began by establish∣ing at Kaffa a Sandjak,
and then a Behjler∣beghjilik, which governed all the domains belonging to the
Porte either in the Crimea, on the borders of the Don, or upon the sea of
Asoph, and left a very strong garrison in that town to intimidate the
Khans. But from the wretched policy of the Turks, they at the same time
shut up the entrance of the Black Sea to other European nati∣ons, so that
trade and commerce were almost ruined in the Crimea, and the ex∣ports, from
that time to this, were con∣fined to the productions of the country and
slaves—</P>
<P>The great market for the Circassians, of which we have heard
so much and know so little, was at Kaffa; where they came and sold their
children to Greeks, Genoese, Jews, or Armenians, who sold them in their
turn <PB N="201" REF="209"/> at Constantinople, but that was before the Turks
had extended their power over the Crimea—</P>
<P>When the sovereignty of the peninsula passed to
Mengheli-Gherai, there were but few Tartarian inhabitants; but the wars he was
engaged in against them, on the borders of the Volga, gave him an
oppor∣tunity to bring back into the Crimea with him many thousand Nogais,
which he oblig∣ed to fix there, in this method of peo∣pling the country, he was
followed by his successors, who furnished the Kouban, and the country
between the Don and the Dneister with their prisoners—</P>
<P>The Crimea was for a long time a formi∣dable power to the
Russians and Poles, till these nations became improved in military
science. Until the peace of Karlowitz, both these nations were obliged to
pay the Khan to the amount of 100,000 rixdollars, to insure their countries
from the incursions of the Tartars; Russia has gained ground by degrees,
and by arms and policy is be∣come <PB N="202" REF="210"/> master of the
peninsula; the last Khan has a pension from the Empress, and is
re∣tired to live as a private gentleman; long before he resigned his
sovereignty; the Turkish cabinet on one side; the crafty policy of the
Russians on the other, left him no peace; even some hordes of Tartars
insulted his tottering power. Thus, my dear Sir, I have summed up as well
as I am able, a sketch of the past and present revo∣lutions that happened
in the country I am proceeding to, in which there are at present about thirty
thousand of the Empress's troops, including five thousand Cossacks in
her pay; which I am very curious to see. The Khan's palaces, noble Tartar
houses, and others are prepared for her re∣ception, in which I am assured
I shall be received and treated perfectly well. Not∣withstanding all that
has been said to deter me from continuing my tour, I shall certain∣ly go
on, and if I am not poisoned by the waters in Tartary, or drowned in my
pas∣sage by the Black Sea to Constantinople, I shall, I hope, afford
you some amusement <PB N="203" REF="211"/> in the geographical
descriptions I shall give you, and variety of military figures: who though
not versed in tactics like your Prus∣sian troops, may always entertain
any per∣son, who, like you, are a good soldier by in∣heritance, example,
and practice; I am going to dine at my banker's, who insists on shewing
me his very fine hot-houses, and having the honour of giving me a good

<P>I Was obliged to put my kibitkas on wheels at a vile little town
called Soumi, before I arrived at Pultawa. Notwithstand∣ing there might have
been many things worth stopping to look at in the immense town of Moscow,
I was so impatient to meet the spring, that I would not send my name to
any person whose civilities would have obliged me to stay. I cannot say
that Mos∣cow gives me any other idea than of a large village, or many
villages joined, as the houses stand at such a distance, and it is
such a ter∣rible way to go to visit things or people, that I should have
made as many long journeys in a week, as there are days in one, had I staid.
What is particularly gaudy and ugly at Moscow are the steeples, square
lumps of <PB N="205" REF="213"/> different coloured bricks and gilt spires or
ovals; they make a very Gothic appearance, but it is thought a public beauty
there; a widow lady was just dead, who having outlived all the people that
she loved, she left an immense sum of money to gild with the purest
gold, the top of one of the steeples—</P>
<P>At Pultawa I was shewn the ground on which the armies moved, a
memorable check to the wild spirit of Charles the Twelfth. A private
person, one Paul Budenkof, has, at his own expence, erected a monument in
remembrance of that event; it is a plate of brass, on which is represented
the battle in a good engraving, the plate is fixed into a pillar. At Soumi I
conversed with a brother of Prince Kourakin's and a Mr. Lanskoy, both
officers quartered there; and to whom I was indebted for a lodging: they
obliged a Jew to give me up a new little house he was upon the point of
inha∣biting. The thaw had come on so quickly <PB N="206" REF="214"/> that I
was obliged to stay two days while my carriages were taken off the
sledges—</P>
<P>Mr. Lanskoy has a little of the beauty and sweetness of
countenance of his cousin who died; the favourite of the Empress; and who,
if his pictures and the medal do not flatter him, was perfectly beautiful. Both
Prince Kourakin and Lanskoy are very impatient to quit such dismal
quarters, and seem to desire some event in which they may display a
military ardour, very natural to soldiers, and increased in them by having
no polished people to converse with; as I found, upon my asking what
society they had, their account of the country nobles thereabout was truly
laugh∣able—</P>
<P>There is no gentleman's house at Pul∣tawa; I slept at my
banker's, and walked all about the skirts of the town—</P>
<P>At Chrementchouk, the general who commands has a very pretty
well-bred wife, <PB N="207" REF="215"/> who did the honours of her house and
the place perfectly well. Prince Potemkin has a large house just out of the
town, which I went to see; at the Governor's I assisted at a dinner
where there was such a num∣ber of people, and so much company after dinner,
that I was heartily tired; there I began to find the manner in which I was
recommended by the prince; the greatest attentions and respect were paid
me. An English woman, married to a Russian who was there, came to my
lodging, and looking earnestly at me, said, are you an English lady? I
smiled and said, quite so: she flung her arms round my neck, and
almost smo∣thered me with kisses; forgive me, said she, I too was
born in England, and have never had the happiness of seeing a
country-wo∣man since I left it; I am married, have children here, and
probably shall never see England again. I was intreated to stay by all
the ladies at least some days; but I can∣not defer too long letting —
know what is become of me; I concealed from — and — my intended
journey, and only wrote word from Petersburgh, that I was 
<PB N="208" REF="216"/> going to make a little tour to a warmer part of that
country; and I mean not to let either of them know where I am till I get safe
to Constantinople.</P>
<P>I am going to see the Dock-Yard here and the fortifications, which
are to be new done by a Colonel Korsakof, a very civil spirited young man
here, who seems to have the welfare of this place and the honour of his
nation very much at heart. I shall give you an account of what I have seen
to∣morrow.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>CHERSON, 
<DATE>March 9, 1786.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>THIS place is situated upon the Dneiper, called by the ancients,
the Boristhenes; which falls into the Black Sea; the only inconvenience of
the Docks here is that the ships, when built, are obliged to be taken with
camels into that part of the channel deep enough to receive them. The town is
not at present very large, though there are many new houses and a church
built after pretty models; good architecture of white stone. There are no
trees near this place; Korsakof is trying to make large plantations; the town
is intirely furnished with fuel by reeds, of which there is an
in∣exhaustible forest in the shallows of the Boristhenes, just facing
Cherson; Rails, and even temporary houses are made of them. These reeds
are strong and tall, and are a <PB N="210" REF="219"/> harbour for birds of
various kind, particu∣larly aquatics; of which there are such a number, and
of such beautiful kinds, that I can conceive nothing so entertaining as
shooting parties in boats here; Korsakof, and a Captain Mordwinof, who both
have been educated in England, will, I have no doubt, make a distinguished
figure in the military annals of Russia; Mordwinof is a sea-officer, and
superintends the ship-build∣ing here; there are some very pretty frigates
on the stocks. Repninskai is the gover∣nor's name, and he has a young wife,
who is very civil; my loding is a large house built for a Greek Archbishop;
but, being empty, was appropriated to my use: I have remonstrated here, but
in vain, against having centinels, and the guard turning out as I pass
through the gates. I hate all kind of ceremony and honours, particularly such
as I am not accustomed to, but I am told here I must content myself with
not refus∣ing the orders that are given; the Empe∣ror's Consul has a wife
who wears a Greek dress here; I think it by no means
becom∣ing—Cherson may in time become a very <PB N="211" REF="220"/>
beautiful town, and furnish the borders of the Boristhenes with examples of
com∣merce; that inestimable and only real source of greatness to an
empire; I am not soldier enough to know what fault there was in the
fortifications, so that they are intirely to be done anew—but by the
active and studious spirit of Korsakof, I have no doubt that they will be
executed in a masterly manner—</P>
<P>I can conceive nothing so pleasant to a young soldier, as to
be employed in places where his talents must create the defence and
stability of newly acquired possessions; I leave this place in two
days, dear Sir; and will do myself the honour of writing from the first
town where I can sit down again for a few days—</P>
<P>I have nothing but maps and plans of various sorts in my head at
present, having looked over all such as my curiosity could induce me to
ask for. The fortifications and plantations are executed here by
ma∣lefactors, whose chains and fierce looks <PB N="212" REF="221"/> struck
horror into my heart, as I walked over them, particularly when I was inform∣ed
there are between three and four thou∣sand. Yet I must confess, I think
this me∣thod of treating criminals much more rati∣onal than that of shutting
them up; and rendering them useless members of the society by which they
must be maintained—</P>
<P>Mordwinof informs me, the frigate which is to convey me to
Constantinople is pre∣pared, and is to wait my pleasure at one of the
seaports in the Crimea, and that the Comte de Wynowitch, who commands at
Sevastopole has directions to accommodate me in the best manner; Mordwinof
and Korsakof both are much more like English∣men than any foreigners I ever
met with, except one, whom you are assured is the person upon earth I
honour and esteem the most; and to whom I subscribe myself with all
respect,</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>KARASBAYER, 
<DATE>April 3, 1786.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Went in a barge for about two hours down the Boristhenes, and
landed on the shore opposite to that on which Cherson stands. A
carriage and horses belonging to a Major who commands a post about two
hours drive from the place where I landed were waiting, and these conveyed me
to his house, where I found a great dinner prepared, and he gave me some
excellent fresh-butter made of Buffalo's milk; this poor man has just
lost a wife he loved, and who was the only delight he could possess in
a most disagreeable spot, marshy, low, and where he can have no other
amuse∣ment but the troops. From thence I crossed the plains of Perekop,
on which nothing but a large coarse grass grows, which is burnt at certain
periods of the year. All <PB N="214" REF="223"/> this country, like that between
Cherson and Chrementchruh, is called Steps, I should call it desert;
except where the post-horses are found, not a tree not a habita∣tion is to
be seen. But one thing which delighted me much, for several miles after I
had quitted Cherson, was the immense flocks of birds; bustards, which I
took at a certain distance for herds of calves, and millions of a small
bird about the size of a pigeon, cinnamon colour and white; droves of a kind
of wild small goose, cinnamon colour, brown, and white. As I went farther
on, these multitudes decreased, not choosing I suppose to go too far
from their shelter, the reeds—</P>
<P>Perekop is situated upon an eminence; the ditch of it seems
rather calculated for the lodgment of an enemy than a defence. The governor did
every thing he could to detain me a few hours; but, as there was nothing to
see, I went on. Just without the fortress of Perekop I was obliged to
send one of my servants to a Tartar village to get a pass; the servant
whom I sent, whose <PB N="215" REF="224"/> ridiculous fears through the
whole journey have not a little amused me, came back as pale as death. He
told me the chiefs were sit∣ting in a circle smoaking, that they were very
ill black-looking people; I looked at the pass, it was in Turkish or
Tartarian characters. I saw there two camels drawing a cart; this village
gave me no great opinion of Tartarian cleanliness, a more dirty misera∣ble
looking place I never saw. The land at Perekop is but six miles across
from the sea of Asoph, or rather an arm of it called the Suash, to the
Black Sea. The Crimea might with great ease be made an island; after
leaving Perekop, the country is exactly like what we call downs in England, and
the turf is like the finest green velvet. The horses flew along; and though
there was not a horse in the stables of the post-houses, I did not wait
long to have them harnessed; the Cossacks have the furnishing of the
horses, and versts or mile-stones are put up; the horses were all
grasing on the plain at some distance, but the instant they see their
Cossack come out with a little corn the whole herd surrounds him, and he
takes <PB N="216" REF="225"/> those he pleases. The posts were sometimes
in a deserted Tartarian village, and some∣times the only habitation for the
stable-keeper was a hut made under ground, a common habitation in this
country, where the sun is extremely hot, and there is no shade of any
sort. To the left of Perekop I saw several lakes about the third post;
it was a most beautiful sight. About sun-set I arrived at a Tartarian
village, of houses or rather huts straggling in a circle without fence of
any kind. At different spots upon the downs, large herds of horses, cows,
and sheep were approaching, with a slow pace, the village; making at once a
simple and majestic landscape, full of that peace and plenty which
possessions in the primitive state of the world might have
en∣joyed—</P>
<P>I stopped there and made tea; that I might go on, as far as I
could that night. You must not suppose, my dear Sir, though I have left
my coach and harp at Peters∣burgh, that I have not all my little
necessa∣ries even in a kibitka—a tin-kettle in a bas∣ket 
<PB N="217" REF="226"/> holds my tea equipage, and I have my English
side-saddle tied behind my carriage. What I have chiefly lived upon is new
milk, in which I melt a little chocolate. At every place I have stopped at I
asked to taste the water from curiosity, I have always found it perfectly
good —</P>
<P>I can easily suppose people jealous of Prince Potemkin's
merit; his having the government of the Tauride, or command∣ing the troops in
it, may have caused the invention of a thousand ill-natured lies about this
new country, in order to lessen the share of praise which is his due,
in the attainment or preservation of it; but I see nothing at present
which can justify the idea of the country's being unwholesome. To-morrow I
shall have the honour of giv∣ing you an account of my arrival and recep∣tion
here, and what sort of a place it is.</P>

<DATE>April 4. 1786.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>ABOUT half an hour after ten last night I ordered my servants
not to have the horses put to, as I intended to sleep, for the only thing
in which I am a bad travel∣ler is, that I cannot go to sleep while the
carriage is in motion. I had not an idea of getting out of it, as our Post
was a vile Tartar village; in a few minutes the ser∣vants called me, and
said, the General's ne∣phew and son were arrived to meet me, and very
sorry to find I had quitted Perekop, as they had orders to escort me from
thence. I opened my carriage and saw two very pretty looking young men; I
told them I should certainly not think of detaining them; and we set off,
nor did I suspect that there were any persons with me but them: at
— o'clock I let down the forepart of my carriage to see the sun
rise; when, to my great surprise, I saw a guard of between twenty and
thirty Cossacks, with an officer, who was close to the fore-wheel of the
car∣riage; <PB N="219" REF="228"/> upon seeing me he smiled and pulled off
his cap—his companions gave a most vi∣olent shriek, and horses,
carriages, and all increased their pace, so that the horses in the
carriage behind mine took fright, ran away, and running against my carriage
very nearly overturned it; and when I ask∣ed what occasioned this event, I
found my Cossack escort, seeing my carriage shut, thought I was dead;
as a Cossack has no idea that a person in health can travel in a carriage
that is not open, and the shout I had heard, the smile I had seen, was
the surprise they had felt, that the young Eng∣lish princess, as they
called me, was alive; as they believed it was only my corpse that was
conveying to Karasbazar to be buried. They always ride with long pikes,
holding the points upwards; the Tartars ride with pikes, but they hold the ends
of theirs to the ground. About six I passed the Tartar town of
Karasbazar, lying to the left—and arrived at the General's house, a
very good one, newly built for the recepti∣on of the Empress; the General
Kokotch∣ki, his brother the governor, and almost all the general officers
were up and dressed; <PB N="220" REF="229"/> upon the steps of the house
I found myself in my night-cap, a most tired and forlorn figure, in the
midst of well-powdered men, and as many stars and ribbons around me as if I
had been at a birth-day at St. James's. I retired, but rose again at one,
dressed and dined, and looked about me; this house is situated near the
river Karasou or Black∣water, which bathes the lawn before the house, and
runs in many windings towards the town; it is narrow, rapid, and very clear;
this is a most rural and lovely spot, very well calculated to give the
Empress a good opinion of her new kingdom, for so it may be called. I had a
Cossack chief pre∣sented to me, a soldier-like fine white∣haired
figure, he wore a ribband and order the Empress had given him set round
with brillants. The general told me he was sorry he was not thirty years
younger, as the Empress had not a braver officer in her service. In the
evening, in an amazing large hall, several different bands of music played;
and I heard the national songs of the Russian peasants, which are so
singular that I cannot forbear endeavouring to give <PB N="221" REF="230"/>
you some idea of them. One man stands in the midst of three or four, who
make a circle round him; seven or eight more make a second round those; a
third is composed of a greater number; the man in the mid∣dle of this groupe
begins, and when he has sung one verse, the first circle accompany him,
and then the second, till they become so animated, and the noise so
great, that it was with difficulty the officers could stop them. What is very
singular they sing in parts, and though the music is not much varied nor
the tune fine, yet as some take thirds and fifths as their ear direct, in
per∣fect harmony, it is by no means unpleasing. If you ask one of them why
he does not sing the same note as the man before him, he does not know what
you mean. The subjects of these ballads are, hunting, war, or
counterfeiting the gradations between soberness into intoxication, and very
di∣verting. As these singers were only young Russian peasants, they
began with great timidity, but by little and little ended in a kind of wild
jollity, which made us all laugh very heartily. The Governor's residence is 
<PB N="222" REF="231"/> not here, but at a place called Atchmechet; he is only
come here to meet and conduct me through the Crimea; he is a grave
sen∣sible mild man. I am told he has conciliated the Tartars to their
change of sovereign very much by his gentleness and firmness. To their
honour, I find none would stay who could not bear the idea of taking the
oaths of allegiance, but are gone towards Mount Caucasus. They have repented
since, but it was too late. All the country here is downs except the borders
of vallies, where rice is cultivated, and what the Tartars call gardens, which
I call orchards. I cannot tell you, Sir, with what respect and atten∣tion I
am treated here, and how good-na∣turedly all the questions I ask are
answer∣ed—</P>
<P>There is an Albanian Chief here, though his post is at Bilaklava,
a sea-port; he is distinguished by the Empress likewise for his
bravery; his dress differs much from the Cossack; it is something like
the ancient Romans—he is an elderly man too. In a day or two I shall
give you an account of <PB N="223" REF="232"/> the source of the Karasou,
and take my leave of this place for Batcheferai, the prin∣cipal town and
formerly the chief residence of the Khans.</P>

<P>YESTERDAY I went to see the source of the river, it lies in the
recess of a rock, which is placed between many others that line the steep
sides of a valley; a Major Ri∣bas, a very lively handsome officer of the
Chasseurs, has drawn it for me. I rode a white horse of the general's, a
very quiet creature, but awakward, not being used to a
side-saddle—</P>
<P>I never saw a scene so lively as this visit; there were near
forty people on horseback; the variety of dresses and colours upon the
green carpet was gay and picturesque. We continued going up hill to the
source, till we perceived the rocks, but the sides of them were so
steep that we were obliged to dis∣mount and scramble down as we could; 
<PB N="225" REF="234"/> this spring does not present itself like the
Vaucluse, majestic and terrible, but pretty and romantic; and might be
copied in a park where huge fragments of stone could be had. As we returned,
I got off and walked beside the soldiers houses, and went into some;
they are placed in a line on the declivity of the down, as they descend to
the General's house; all things were very neat and orderly. The old
Cossack chief had looked with the greatest astonishment at my riding,
and when I jumped down from my horse on returning home, he kissed the
edge of my petticoat, and said something in his language which I did not
comprehend, but the general told me he had paid me the highest compliment
imaginable, viz. I was worthy of being a Cossack—</P>
<P>In the evening I went in a carriage with the governor and general to
Karasbazar; and on the road saw a mock battle between the Cossacks. As
I was not apprised before∣hand, I confess the beginning of it
astonish∣ed me very much. I saw the Cossack guard 
<PB N="226" REF="235"/> on each side the carriage spring from their
stirrups, with their feet on the saddle and gallop away thus with a loud
shriek. The General smiled at my astonished looks; and told me the
Cossack Chief had ordered an entertainment for me, and desired me to get
out and stand on the rising part of the down, facing that where a troop of
Cossacks was posted, which I saw advancing with a slow pace; a
detached Cossack of the adverse party approached the troop, and turning
round sought his scattered compa∣nions, who were in search like him of
the little army; they approached, but not in a squadron, some on the left,
some on the right, some before, some behind the troop—a
shriek—a pistol fired, were the signals of battle—the troop
was obliged to divide in order to face an enemy that attacked it on all
sides. The greatest scene of hurry and agility ensued; one had seized
his enemy, pulled him off his horse, and was upon the point of stripping
him<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A Cossack, if he can avoid it, never kills his
enemy be∣fore he has stripped him, because the spoils are his property,
and he fears the blood should spoil the dress—</NOTE>, when 
<PB N="227" REF="236"/> one of the prisoner's party came up, laid him to the
ground, remounted his compa∣nion, and rode off with the horse of the first
victor. Some flung themselves off their horses to tear their foe to the
ground; alternately they pursued or were pursuing, their pikes, their
pistols, their hangers all were made use of; and when the parties were
completely engaged together, it was difficult to see all the adroit
manoeuvres that passed—</P>
<P>I was much entertained and pleased; and desired the Cossack
Chief might have my best thanks. I arrived at the town, and was led to the
Kadis' house, where his wife received me, and no male creature was suffered
to come into the room, except the interpreter and a young Russian nobleman
only twelve years of age. This woman had a kind of turban on, with some
indif∣ferent diamonds and pearls upon it. Her nails were dyed scarlet, her
face painted white and red, the veins blue; she appear∣ed to me to be a
little shrivelled woman of near sixty, but I was told she was not above 
<PB N="228" REF="237"/> fifty. She had a kind of robe and vest on, and her
girdle was a handkerchief embroi∣dered with gold and a variety of colours. She
made me a sign to sit down; and my gloves seeming to excite much
uneasiness in her I took them off; upon which she drew near, smiled,
took one of my hands be∣tween her's, and winked and nodded as a sign of
approbation; but she felt my arm up beyond the elbow, half way up my
shoulder, winking and nodding. I began to wonder where this extraordinary
exami∣nation would end, which it did there. Coffee was brought, and after that
rose-leaves made into sweetmeats, both of which the interpreter obliged me
to taste. The sweetmeats are introduced last, and among the Orientals
they are a signal that the visit must end. Our conversation by the
inter∣preter was not very entertaining. She asked if I had a child, and told
me what I have been told so often before, though I confess not by
women<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tartarian and Turkish women, deriving the only
plea∣sures of society from women, have none of that envy which prevails in
European female breasts—and among the Tartarian and Turkish women,
the extravagant encomiums which fall from the lips of a man desperately in
love with a pretty woman, are to be heard and are in frequent use.</NOTE>,
that would be <PB N="229" REF="238"/> unnecessary to repeat it. A Tartar
house is a very slight building of one story only; no chair, table, or
piece of furniture in wood to be seen; large cushions are ranged round the
room, on which we sat or reclined; but what is extremely convenient, I
ob∣served more than double the space of the room behind the wainscot,
which drew back in most places, so that in a small room, where it appears
there is nothing but the cushions, every necessary is to be found. As the
visit was at an end, I curtsied and she bowed. In the court-yard there
was a dancer, a woman accompanied in her ges∣tures by a boy, but it was
impossible to see them either with pleasure or propriety; she never
lifted her feet off the ground but once in four minutes, and then only one foot
at a time, and every part of her person danced except her feet. I went to a
Mosque, where several pious Mussulmen were going round in a circle in
the midst of the build∣ing, <PB N="230" REF="239"/> groaning and slinging
their heads al∣most to the ground and then up again, a constant motion
which with the moving round one way soon puts them into a kind of torture,
under which they fall to the ground; and then are dragged into recesses in
the Mosque, made on purpose to receive these boly men, who sacrifice
so many hours, and their persons to idle pain, in order to prove their
devotion to Mahomet. They frequently pronounced Allah—</P>
<P>In one of the recesses I saw a man lying, that I was told had
been there without eating or drinking forty hours; which ab∣stinence is
another pious act, and if their courage is excessive, and Allah can
inspire them with strength enough, they endeavour in getting out of the
dark and damp hole where they lay for many hours, to join in the circle, and
begin to move, but in this attempt they generally fall senseless to the
ground, and are carried home to recover their strength. This kind of mummery
in∣spires the people with a great reverence and esteem for those who
practise it. I return∣ed <PB N="231" REF="240"/> home as much disgusted
with this non∣sense as I was displeased with the dirt of the town. The
Mosque was shabby on the outside and gloomy within, notwithstand∣ing
many lamps in it. The Minaret, which we should call a steeple, and all the
other Minarets I saw in the town, are uncom∣monly light, being very high and
narrow. A man stands at the top and calls to pray∣ers, instead of tolling
bells as we do, at par∣ticular hours, and makes a noise to the full as
agreeable—</P>
<P>The chief traffic of this town is the lea∣ther which we call
Morocco, of various co∣lours, yellow, red, green, and blue; it is to be had
very cheap, and is like sattin. The innumerable sheep with which these
plains are covered furnish much leather, which is a cheap commodity, as well
as the most beautiful and costly pelisses. The sheep are all
spotted. The lamb-skins are beautiful, and they kill the ewes to have the
lamb-skins before the birth; these have small spots, and are smooth
like the lightest and finest sattins. As many of these little 
<PB N="232" REF="241"/> animals must be skinned to make the lin∣ing of one
coat, it is no wonder this is one of the most sumptuous presents the
Empress can make to an ambassador. I wish I was rich enough to send
you a pe∣lisse made of these skins—</P>

<P>IN my way hither I dined at the Cossack Chief's post, and my
entertainment was truly Cossack. A long table for thirty peo∣ple; at one
end a half-grown pig roasted whole; at the other a half-grown sheep, whole
likewise; in the middle of the table an immense tureen of curdled milk;
there were several side-dishes made for me and the Russians, as well
as the cook could imagine to our taste. The old warrior would fain have made
me taste above thirty sorts of wine from his country, the borders of the
Don; but I contented myself with three or four, and some were very good.
After dinner from the windows, I saw a fine mock battle between the
Cossacks; and I saw three Calmoucks, the ugliest fiercest looking men
imaginable, with <PB N="234" REF="243"/> their eyes set in their head,
inclining down to their nose, and uncommonly square jaw∣bones. These
Calmoucks are so dexterous with bows and arrows that one killed a goose at
a hundred paces, and the other broke an egg at fifty. The young Cossack
officers tried their skill with them, but they were perfectly novices in
comparison to them; they sung and danced, but their steps and their tones
were equally insipid, void of grace and harmony.</P>
<P>When a Cossack is sick he drinks sour milk for a few days,
and that is the only remedy the Cossacks have for fevers—</P>
<P>At night I lodged at a house that had belonged to a noble Tartar,
where there is a Russian post, with about twelve hundred of the finest
men I ever saw, and uncom∣monly tall. A Tartarian house has always another
building at a little distance from it for the convenience of travellers or
strangers, whom the noble Tartar always treats with the greatest
hospitality; here the General parted from us. I proceeded in the Go∣vernor's 
<PB N="235" REF="244"/> carriage with him thus far, the rest of our company
went to see Kaffa or The∣odosia. I go to meet them to-morrow, at a place
called Mangouss. We had only two Cossacks with us, as the General, to
please the Tartars, never is escorted by a military party. Batchescrai is
situated in so steep a valley, that some of the hanging pieces of rock
seem ready to fall and crush the houses. About a mile from the town on
the left, I saw a troop of well-dressed Tartars, there were above a
hundred on horseback; the Kaima-Kan<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">That word means
the Khan's first minister—a person called him cream of
Tartar—which I fearing he should be told of, turned into the cream of
the Tartars—which he said was no wonder; as he was so—</NOTE>
was at the head of this company, who were come out to meet and escort us, but
I who did not know this, asked the Governor if there was a Russian post
here; which there is above the town, of a thousand men. There are five
thousand Tartar inhabitants here; I do not believe there was a man left in
his house, the streets being lined with Tartarian men on each side; their
countenances were very <PB N="236" REF="245"/> singular, most of them kept
their eyes fixed on the ground, as we passed; but some just looked up,
and, as if they were afraid of seeing a woman's face uncovered, hastily
cast their eyes downward again; some diverted at the novelty, looked and
laughed very much—There is a great trade here of blades for swords,
hangers, and knives—I am assured many made here are not to be
distinguished from those of Damascus—</P>
<P>The Khan's palace is an irregular build∣ing, the greatest part of
it is one floor raised upon pillars of wood painted and gilt in a fanciful
and lively manner, the arch, or last door-way, has fine proportions, a large
in∣scription in gilt letters is the chief ornament—I am told it was
perfectly in ruins, but the governor has had it repaired, new gilt, and painted
for the Empress's reception. Court within court, and garden within gar∣den,
make a variety of apartments where the Khan walked from his own residence to
the Harem<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Harem means that apartment where the women
reside; which is always a separate building from that which the ma∣ster
inhabits—and sisters, mothers, wives, or mistresses all inhabit
the Harem—</NOTE>, which is spacious and higher <PB N="237" REF="246"/>
than the other buildings. What I thought pretty enough was that several of
the square places under his apartment were paved with marble, and have in the
center fountains which play constantly. My room is a square of more than
forty feet, having two rows of windows one above the other on three sides,
and it was with diffi∣culty I found a place to have my bed put up in—</P>
<P>I never saw such a variety of colours—different coloured
gold and silver mixed to∣gether. The Kaima-Kan, and two other principal
Tartars, supped with us, and I find nothing can exceed the ignorance and
simplicity of these people. The Kaima-Kan is the Khan's first minister;
he is total∣ly ignorant of the geography of his own country; and says that
England and Peter∣sburgh are the same thing; I am to dine with his
sister to-morrow; she is married to a rich Tartar, who has given a
certain yearly sum to possess, solely, the profits of the soap
mines. For among the excellent productions of this peninsula, there is a mine
of earth exactly like soap, and reckoned <PB N="238" REF="247"/> very good for
the skin; the Turkish wo∣men consume a great quantity of it at
Con∣stantinople; and I am told this Tartar makes an immense income from it.
I saw from the windows a kind of dome which raised my curiosity, and I am
told it is a monument built to the memory of a Chris∣tian wife, which the
Khan loved so tender∣ly that he was inconsolable for her loss; and that
he had placed it there, that he might have the satisfaction of looking at the
building which contained her remains<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Many buildings
such as baths, summer-houses, &amp;c. are in ruins near Batcheserai. I
went into one bath, it was circular, having white marble on the inside, with
niches for the bathers to sit in, which we have no idea of. Cold bathing is
unknown in Turkey and Tartary—</NOTE>—This Tartar Khan must have
had a soul worthy of being loved by a Christian wife I think—</P>

<P>THE last time I wrote I was at Batche∣serai, since which I
have been at another Russian post, at the place where the ancient town of
Krim stood, of which there is not a vestige left. A General Schlikt
commands a fine regiment of Russian cavalry there, and lodges in an outer
building belonging to a good house prepared for the Empress. This general
fought very valiantly in the Polish Confederacy against the Russians,
and his bravery induced the Empress to take him into her service. He
shewed me among his horses a fine chestnut or rather gold-coloured
Arabian, so beautiful an ani∣mal I never before saw. I must not forget to
tell you that I went, as I told you I should, to dine with the Kaima-Kan's
sister, whose harem, with her husband's house, <PB N="241" REF="250"/>
is situated in a very romantic manner at the foot of some very
extraordinary rocks, from which issue many clear springs, that supply
the houses and her bath with perpe∣tual fresh water; there is a strange
ap∣pearance on the summit of those rocks, places where immense cables
have certainly passed and been tied. The Tartarians in∣sist upon it
that the sea once lay at the foot of them; and ships were fastened to
them. We dined in the husband's apartment, a very dirty shabby place for
so rich a gentle∣man—Tartarian cookery consists in much grease
and honey; after dinner, the Kaima-Kan walked across a yard, and I was bid to
follow. I did so into another court, where four women and some young girls
met us, and last of all his sister. Her dress was magnificent,
particularly her girdle, in the front of which were two circles like bracelet
lockets; the centers of them contained two fine emeralds. She offered me a
large gob∣let which held two quarts of sherbet, an in∣different kind of
lemonade; after that coffee, and last of all sweetmeats. We conversed
very well by signs, she was neither old nor <PB N="242" REF="251"/> ugly,
but how is it possible to judge of a countenance hid under bad painting,
and eyebrows which join into one straight line drawn across the nose? My
gloves gave her the same uneasy appearance I had seen in the other
Tartarian woman, so I pulled them off, but she was not so curious as the
other, and it seemed to be a high entertain∣ment to her brother to see us
converse by signs. I wore a <HI>chemise</HI> with two rows of very fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e lace at the bosom, which I thought
would surprise her, but lace, and every magnificence which is not gold,
silver, pearls, or diamonds, I am told passes unnoticed—Linen is
not much in use; their shifts, and the shirts of the men, are generally
made of very thin silk, or silk mixed with cotton, which is seldom
changed; but the very srequent use of baths makes this custom less
loathsome than it would otherwise be, When she had quitted the harem, her
bro∣ther staid behind a little, and afterwards came up to me, kissed the
bottom of my gown, and presented me a very beautiful handkerchief of his
sister's embroidery, which the governor told me I must accept; 
<PB N="243" REF="252"/> I desired the Kaima-Kan to thank her, and tell her I
would keep it for her sake; it is of muslin, the borders embroidered with
different coloured silks and gold, and what I cannot comprehend, both sides
are the same—</P>
<P>I have been at Soudak, where the foun∣dations yet remain of a very
large town, which was rebuilt by the Genoese, on the descent of steep
rocks. When you get to the summit of these you look down to the sea, and
there are the remains of a chapel, where a granite pillar is so placed that
the first shake it receives it must fall perpendicu∣larly into it This
town must have been in∣accessible to a fleet, and from the position of
the fortifications and out-posts, of which there are remains, must have
been ex∣tremely well defended from the inhabitants of the interior part of the
country—</P>
<P>To the left of the town there is a fine harbour; it is upon this
southern part of the peninsula that vines are cultivated, and grow wild in
great abundance; at present only a few private people there have vine∣yards 
<PB N="244" REF="253"/> of their own. There is little good wine made, and the
Empress has indeed a Frenchman, who seems to care only about the strength
of the wine being sufficient to make brandy, which he distils in great
quantities. He is settled at Soudak at pre∣sent, and probably will make a
great for∣tune, but not teach the culture of vines to the Russians. From
Soudak I went to Atchmetchet, the residence of the gover∣nor; it is prettily
situated on a rising ground, not far from the valley which borders the
river Salguir; and the soil on the borders of this river is exactly like the
black mould of our kitchen gardens, and extremely fer∣tile. The governor's
house is comfortable, and the barracks with the other buildings erected by
the Russians make a good ap∣pearance; I saw some people coursing with
Tartarian greyhounds, which are remarka∣bly tall, and reckoned very good. The
go∣vernor shewed me likewise a pretty collec∣tion of stuffed birds, and
other preservati∣ons; with stones, minerals, the produce of the Crimea; but
the fine turf, the excel∣lent soil, the orchards, the climate, are 
<PB N="245" REF="254"/> sufficient inducements to be partial to this country.
One very particular thing I took notice of was a small pink flower, that
spread like net-work over the turf—and, asking what it was, found
they were peach∣trees, which when very young, being nip∣ped by the sheep,
grow into little bushes—I was really sorry to quit the governor;
grave, steady, and cold in his manner, there was a dignity in it which made
his extreme attention and respect for me the more acceptable, nor can I say
that he for∣got any thing that could make me take a true impression of the
country, or a favour∣able one of the Russian officers, who have given me
several maps, and every infor∣mation I dould desire—I wish it may
ever be in my power to shew him in my country any marks of the sense! I
have of his goodness—I have promised to take a barrel of wine
belonging to Mr. de Bullakos, the Russian Minister at the
Porte—and a root of horse-radish from him—</P>
<P>I find a thirty-six gun frigate, under the disguise of a
merchant-ship, had been fitted <PB N="246" REF="255"/> out for me, and had
been ready above a fortnight; the governor accompanied me to this place, which
the description of would be too long for this letter, so I shall take my
leave of you for the present, only observing that I have a whole house to
my∣self, where the architecture and furniture are English; it belonged to
an Admiral Mackenzie, who is just dead—I crossed an arm of the
sea in the Comte de Wynowitch's barge to arrive here—and upon landing,
at the bottom of a flight of several steps, I was surprised by two or
three voices, who said. we are your countrymen, my Lady—and in fact,
there are several of my country∣men as captains or lieutenants in this navy.
The Admiral's house is just above this land∣ing-place, and makes a fine
appearance—</P>

<HEAD>LETTER LXIII.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Should be very glad you could see this place—From the
singularity of the coast, the harbour is unlike any other I ever saw; it
is a long creek that is formed by the Black Sea between two ridges of land,
so high that The Glory of Catherine, one of the largest ships in the
Russian navy, which is at anchor here, cannot be seen, as the shore is
above the pendant—The water is so deep that this ship touches the
land—All the fleets in Europe would be safe from storms or enemies in
these creeks or har∣bours, for there are many. Batteries at the entrance of
them, on one side, would be sufficient effectually to destroy any ships
that would venture in, and placed towards the sea must even prevent the
entrance of <PB N="248" REF="257"/> a fleet. The Comte de Wynowitch com∣mands
here, and has a little farm at Inker∣man, which must have once been a very
considerable and extraordinary town; at present the only remains of it are
rooms hewn out of the rock. Here is a large chapel, the pillars and altars of
which are extremely curious; the stone is whitish, and not unlike marble. I
climbed up a stair-case, and crept into and out of very extraordinary
spaces large and commodious; I entered at the bottom of these singular
habitations, and like a chimney-sweeper came out at the top; and though it
cost me not a little trouble in turning and climbing up so high, I had no
idea I had mounted so much, till on looking about me I turned quite giddy, in
seeing the Bay of Inkerman and all the Black Sea, at least two hundred and
fifty feet beneath the place where I stood. Though I have not been
absolutely all over this peninsula. I think I am perfect∣ly acquainted with
it; and though it is a new acquaintance to me, I sincerely wish it to be
peopled by the industrious, who may restore to it that commerce and
opu∣lence, <PB N="249" REF="258"/> which the natural productions of it demand
from the hand of man. Can any rational being, dear Sir, see nature, with∣out
the least assistance from art, in all her grace and beauty,
stretching out her liberal hand to industry, and not wish to do her
justice? Yes, I confess, I wish to see a colony of honest English
families here; establishing manufactures, such as England produces, and
returning the produce of this country to ours; establishing a fair and free
trade from hence, and teaching industry and honesty to the insidious but
oppressed Greeks, in their islands—waking the indolent Turk from
his gilded slumbers, and carrying fair Li∣berty in her swelling sails as
she passes through the Archipelago and the Mediter∣ranean, to our
dangerous (happily for us our dangerous) coast—This is no visi∣onary
or poetical figure—it is the honest wish of one who considers all
mankind as one family, and, looking upon them as such, wishes them to be
united for the com∣mon good; excluding from nations all sel∣fish and
monopolizing views—I am in <PB N="250" REF="259"/> possession of
several maps of this country, drawn and coloured very well, which I shall
have the honour of shewing you when I see you. I take my leave at

<HEAD>LETTER XLIV.</HEAD>
<P>WE set out the day before yesterday to see a most beautiful
valley called Baydar, but when we had gone a considerable way across the
mountains in carriages, the Comte de Wynowitch told me that we were
five-and-twenty miles from the place we were going to, and that we must take
the Cossack horses, of which we had five with us, and ride them. As I was
not apprised of this, I had not brought my side-saddle with me. I told
him it was impossible for me to ride astride, and the Cossack
saddles I could not sit upon, so we returned back to Sevastopole. We
set out again yester∣day for the valley of Baydar, and at the same place
where we had left the carriages the day before, I had my side-saddle put 
<PB N="252" REF="261"/> upon the tallest of the Cossack horses, and
after going about twelve miles among the most beautiful mountains imaginable,
a small valley appeared a little to the right of us infinitely pretty. We
crossed that and went through a thick wood, which led to the valley of
Baydar; a most enchanting and magnificent spot, intended by nature for
some industrious and happy nation to enjoy in peace. A few Tartar villages
lessen the wildness of the scene, but, in such a place, the meadow
part should be covered with herds, and the mountainous with sheep. When we
were come into this valley we found the mountains to the left less high, and
less rocky than those to the right, which run in a line with those to
Soudak, and form the coast. When we were in the valley we could not have
ima∣gined that we were so near the sea; as the rocks which are above it are
covered with wood of every sort, wild vine, pomegranate, and many sweet
shrubs; I rode up to an elevation, which is, for as much as I can guess,
the centre of the valley, and sat there <PB N="253" REF="262"/> with my
companions contemplating the beautiful scene. The valley is above twenty
miles long, wide enough to form it into a graceful oval—two or three
small rivers run through it, and there are fine clear springs in every
village. The Albanian Colonel, who had been presented to me at
Karas∣basar, met us with his son; and I shall ne∣ver forget their
appearance. When they heard us coming they got off their horses. I saw the
son first, a tall lad about thirteen years old, in a kind of Roman
warrior's dress, with rows of gold like armour all down the fore part of the
vest—He had a helmet on—As I was not apprised of this, I had no
idea what the vision was that pre∣sented itself, till I saw the father.
They were both leading their horses, and came to me to insist on my
dining at Balaklava, on my way home, which I did; and if I had not been obliged
to quit this country in a ship, I should certainly have bribed my
Cossack to have sold his horse to me; the animal was so excellent a
galloper that I was obliged several times to stop till the rest of the
company came up—</P>
<P><PB N="254" REF="263"/> The Cossacks, Sir, are extremely proud of
their horses, as they say since your im∣mortal uncle the King of
Prussia first rode one, he never has, in time of war, made use of any
other than a horse from the borders of the Don. I do not know who was most
pleased, the Cossack that lent me his horse, or I who rode him. We
turned to the left to go to the Colonel's house, and winding round some
beautiful rocks, the descent of which was gentle, we saw before us the
harbour of Balaklava. The Albani∣an Chief had ranged his regiment in one
straight line, at the foot of the rocks to the left facing the sea, on the
edge of which his house stood. I can conceive nothing so sin∣gular to a
regular corps as the sight of an Albanian troop; they had firelocks of every
country; each man is at liberty to dress and arm himself as he pleases.
Oriental and Italian poniards, with the oddest pistols in the world were
stuck in their girdles; some had hats, others caps, and helmets upon their
heads. Gregorio Chapone, the colonel, desired I might be told they were 
<PB N="255" REF="264"/> alert, spirited, and brave; his post indeed was of
infinite consequence, and he was placed there on that account; opinions were
unanimous concerning his military re∣putation. The Albanians wear short
jack∣ets, with two, three, or four rows of filla∣gree buttons, an ornament they
like much, and I thought them pretty. The Colonel's wife and several other
women received me at the door, and we conversed by interpre∣ters. There were
several Turkish boats in the harbour, but there was a line on the shore
marked with fires which they were not permitted to pass. The Turks came to
sell oranges, and every precaution is taken to prevent their communicating
the plague; so that although they may come on shore, they are obliged to
heap their oranges with∣in the space allotted to them, and bargain at a
distance. We were above thirty people at table, and I returned with my
company to Sevastopole in carriages. I called just now the Turkish
vessels boats, but I am told they are ships; a most dangerous sort of
conveyance for men or merchandise in <PB N="256" REF="265"/> my opinion, long,
narrow, and top-heavy. The frigate prepared for me seems a good ship; the
three sea-officers who go with me, have never been at Constantinople; we go
as merchants, for by a treaty be∣tween the Forte and Russia, trading
vessels may come from the Black Sea into the Canal of Constantinople, but
not men of war. We have a Greek pilot on board, who is to steer us safe,
please Heaven. I am told we are not to be much more than two days in our
passage; but I have told my company I expect to be seven. Why I have
chosen the number seven I cannot guess; but I can give no other reason
to you than that I have long resolved in my mind to expect a triple dose of
any bitter draught I am obliged to swallow; and I assure you, Sir, in
this method of calculating events, I shall not be so often disappointed
as I have been in life, when the natural chearfulness of my mind made me
always <HI>foresee prospe∣rous gales.</HI> I shall write to you next from

<DATE>April 20, 1786.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Am safely arrived, dear Sir, and hasten to inform you how I
made my voyage. I set out the 13th at five in the morning; Mr. de Wynowitch
took me out of the harbour in a small frigate, and after seeing me safe
in my cabbin took leave. I gave him many thanks for the attentions he had paid
me, and wished him an opportunity of signalizing his courage at sea,
which seemed to be the thing he had most at heart. He gave me a royal
salute, and as his guns fired, we set sail with a fair wind; we had not
been two days at sea before we were becalmed; and we lay three days and three
nights, wishing for wind, which came on at last very fresh with rain. It
was a side-wind, the rain prevented us from seeing the Turkish shore
sometimes, and sometimes <PB N="260" REF="269"/> we could see it very
distinctly; but we ran thus four-and-twenty hours to the left, without
seeing the objects that precede the entrance of the Canal. On the seventh
day, the Greek pilot, the only person on board who had ever been at
Constantino∣ple, was dead drunk and incapable of speak∣ing, much less of
steering the ship. The officers were greatly alarmed, and there was a long
consultation between them and the rest of the company. I luckily had a
small map of the Black Sea, and the entrance of the Canal, which alone was
our guide. As to me I had dressed myself in a riding habit, and had a
small box in one hand, an um∣brella in the other, and had told the cap∣tain I
was determined to get into the boat and land on the Turkish shore, rather
than lose sight of the Canal, or sail into it with∣out being quite sure
that we were right. There is a large rock on the European shore, which is
so far distant from it that, unless a map or pilot directs the mariner,
he must infallibly take it for the entrance of the Bosphorus, and several
hundreds of Turk∣ish boats are wrecked upon it yearly.</P>
<P><PB N="261" REF="270"/> The gentlemen and officers stood all the
morning upon deck, watching the shore; we had ran then above ninety leagues
to the left, always seeing land, which was owing to the currents which had
taken our ship during the three days calm, so much more to the right. As to
me I stood be∣tween decks, till the Captain told me to come and look at a
village, church, or something. It was a Turkish Minaret, and a few moments
afterward we saw that rock I dreaded so much, upon which there are about a
thousand Turkish vessels that pe∣rish constantly every year, as the
Turks for∣get as they leave it to the left in coming out, they must leave it
to the right in going in. Perhaps they are like an Irish acquaint∣ance of
mine, who going up a very steep hill in a carriage to pay a visit, could
never be made to understand that he was to go down the hill in returning; the
only argu∣ment he made use of was, that as the road was the same, he must
necessarily go up the hill, having done so, in going over that same
road—</P>
<P>To return to my voyage, Sir: you may judge how infinitely
comfortable I felt, in <PB N="262" REF="271"/> being at anchor about six in
the evening; escaped from all the dangers I had been threatened with upon the
Black Sea; and the ugly circumstance that attended us when we were about to
take our leave of it. I had so many birds, among which was a most beautiful
milk-white small heron, that had taken refuge in the ship, that my cabbin
looked like a bird-shop. We sup∣ped on board very comfortably, and I took
some hours rest; and the next morning we put ourselves in the long-boat,
and were rowed to Mr. de Bukalow's house at Bou∣yukdere, but he was at Pera,
so we were rowed by a Turkish boat down to Pera. The Bosphorus takes a
sudden turn at Bou∣yukdere—I refer you to Mr. Gibbon, Sir, for his
account of the singular situation of Constantinople, my pen will repeat
feebly what he has described in language majestic as the subject
deserves. But I am certain no landscape can amuse or please in
compa∣rison with the varied view, which the bor∣ders of this famed Straight
compose. Rocks, verdure, ancient castles, built on the summit of the
hills by the Genoese—modern Kiosks<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Kiosk
means a summer-house with blinds all round.</NOTE>, <PB N="263" REF="272"/>
Minarets, and large platane-trees, rising promiscuous in the
vallies—large meadows—multitudes of people, and boats swarm∣ing
on the shore and on the water; and what was particular, nothing to be seen
like a formal French garden. The Turks have so great a respect for natural
beauties, that if they must build a house where a tree stands, they leave
a large hole for the tree to pass through and increase in size, they
think the branches of it the prettiest ornament for the top of the house;
in truth, Sir, contrast a chimney to a beauti∣ful foliage, and judge if they
are right or wrong. The coast is so safe that a large fleet of Turkish
vessels is to be seen in every creek, masts of which are intermingled
with the trees, and a graceful confusion and va∣riety make this living
picture the most poignant scene I ever beheld.</P>
<P>Judge of Mr. de Bukalow's surprise, when he had opened his
letters and read my name, he had scarcely time to offer me his services,
when Mr. de Choiseul's people came and claimed me from their master, 
<PB N="264" REF="273"/> who had been prepared for three weeks be∣fore my
arrival, by Mr. de Segur at Peters∣burgh; and, I confess, from the
character I had heard of him, I was not at all sorry that he claimed my
society as his <HI>droit</HI>—And now I have heard him speak, I am
ex∣tremely glad that I am to profit by his con∣versation and company, both of
which are as much to be desired as talents and polite∣ness can make them.

been out, but his spirits are better, and upon my ac∣count he has opened his
house, and goes out a little, which cannot fail to do him good. He has some
artists with him, whose pencils he has employed to collect all the finest
drawings, coloured, of the finest ruins that exist either in Europe or
Asia, where an artist could venture. Monsieur Casas, one of them, has
been plundered by Arabs several times; but his beautiful and accurate
drawings will gain him immortal honour. The Comte de Choiseul's collection
is, per∣haps, the only thing in the world of the kind, and he means, when he
returns to <PB N="266" REF="275"/> Paris, to have all the ruins and temples
ex∣ecuted in plaster of Paris, or some materials which will copy the

drawings of them. At night when we have no visitors, and all the

singular instance of good taste in a Frenchman, to have given him∣self
up ten years ago to the finding and col∣lecting all that is really best
worthy of re∣cord, <PB N="267" REF="276"/> as to the ancient architecture. Mr.
de Choiseul's <HI>Voyage Pittoresque de la Grece,</HI> and when he was but
two-and-twenty, taking the most perilous journeys to find out new
antiquities, if I may so call them, must endear him to all lovers of the
fine arts—but now that his judgment is formed, and that he sits down to
collect all his materials together, I doubt not the work he is about to
publish, which is an addition to the first, will be the most perfect
thing of the kind existing. You will wonder that I do not begin this letter
by giving you a magnifi∣cent account of the view from my windows; but my eyes
and ears both are so much better pleased within than without doors, that I
must first give you an account of what passes there. Mr. de Choiseul,
beside being a very fine scholar, is a very lively and polite man; and has
none of that kind of most odious attention which young Frenchmen display,
thinking it necessary to say fine things to, or admire ladies upon the
slightest acquaintance; he has the dig∣nity of the <HI>Vieille cour,</HI>
with the ease of modern manners; and, if I was the Em∣press 
<PB N="268" REF="277"/> of Russia, he could not treat me with more
respect, no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> if I was his
sister with more regard. His house is like a very fine French Hotel at
Paris, built with good stone and wood, rare materials here, where every
house is in the construction like a stage, and composed of as slight
materials From some of the windows I look across that harbour called the
Golden Horn by the ancients, and from others can see the sea of Marmo∣ra,
the islands therein, and part of the Se∣raglio—from mine I saw
yesterday the Sul∣tan sitting on a silver sofa, while his boats, and
many of the people who were to ac∣company him, were lining the banks of the
garden. A magnificent sight, as they are of a light shape, gilt, and
painted very beautifully. We had a large telescope, and saw the Ottoman
solendour very distinctly. The Sultan dyes his beard black, to give
himself a young look—and he is known at a considerable distance by
that, which con∣trasts singularly with his face, that is ex∣tremely livid
and pale. The kiosk, which contained him and his silver sofa, was not
very large, and like a hundred others to be <PB N="269" REF="278"/> seen on
the Canal. It is strange, Sir, how words gain in other countries a
signification different from the meaning they possess in their own.
Serail, or Seraglio, is generally understood as the habitation, or rather the
confinement of women; here it is the Sul∣tan's residence; it cannot be called
his pa∣lace, for the kiosks, gardens, courts, walls, stables, are so
mixed, that it is many houses in many gardens.</P>
<P>The streets both of Pera and Constanti∣nople are so narrow
that few of them admit of a carriage—the windows of every story project
over those under them, so that at the upper people may shake hands
some∣times across the street. No Turk of any consequence makes a
visit, if it is only four doors from his own, but on horseback; and, on my
arrival here, I saw one who landed in a boat, and had a fine grey horse led
by four men, that went a long way round, which he mounted gravely, to get off
in a few moments.</P>
<P><PB N="270" REF="279"/> As to women, as many, if not more than men,
are to be seen in the streets—but they look like walking mummies. A
large loose robe of dark green cloth covers them from the neck to the ground,
over that a large piece of muslin, which wraps the shoulders and the arms,
another which goes over the head and eyes; judge, Sir, if all these
co∣verings do not confound all shape or air so much, that men or women,
princesses and slaves, may be concealed under them. I think I never saw
a country where women may enjoy so much liberty, and free from all reproach,
as in Turkey. A Turkish husband that sees a pair of slippers at the
door of his harem must not enter; his res∣pect for the sex prevents him
from intrud∣ing when a stranger is there upon a visit; how easy then is
it for men to visit and pass for women! If I was to walk about the
streets here I would certainly wear the same dress, for the Turkish
women call others names, when they meet them with their faces uncovered. When I
go out I have the Ambassador's sedan-chair, which is like mine in London,
only gilt and varnished <PB N="271" REF="280"/> like a French coach, and six
Turks carry it; as they fancy it impossible that two or four men can carry
one; two Janissaries walk before with high fur caps on. The Ambassadors
here have all Janissaries as guards allowed them by the Porte. Thank Heaven
I have but a little way to go in this pomp, and fearing every moment the Turks
should fling me down they are so awkward; for the platform, where people
land and embark from and to Pera is not far from this house—</P>
<P>There the Ambassador's boat waits for us, and we row out: boats
here are to be hired as hackney-coaches are in London, and all very beautifully
carved, most of them with some gilding; the shape of these boats is
light and beautiful, and the Turks row very well, which is a thing quite
in∣compatible with the idleness visible in all ranks of people. I saw a
Turk the other day lying on cushions, striking slowly an iron which he
was shaping into an horse∣shoe, his pipe in his mouth all the
time—nay, among the higher order of Turks, <PB N="272" REF="281"/> there
is an invention which saves them the trouble of holding the pipe, two small
wheels are fixed on each side the bowl of the pipe, and thus the smoaker
has only to puff away, or let the pipe rest upon his under lip, while he
moves his head as he pleases. Perhaps, Sir, it is lucky for Europe that the
Turks are idle and ignorant; the immense power this empire might have, were
it peopled by the industrious and ambitious, would make it the mistress
of the world. At present it only serves as a dead wall to intercept the
commerce and battles which other powers might create one another—</P>
<P>The quiet stupid Turk will sit a whole day by the side of the
Canal, looking at flying kites or children's boats—and I saw one who
was enjoying the shade of an im∣mense platane-tree—his eyes fixed on
a kind of bottle, diverted by the noise and motion of it, while the stream
kept it in constant motion. How the business of the nation goes on at all
I cannot guess, for the cabinet is composed generally of ignorant
mercenaries; the Visir was a water-carrier <PB N="273" REF="282"/> to
Hassan Bey, the Capitan Pacha, or high∣admiral. Hassan himself was
only a ser∣vant at Algiers. Places are obtained at the Porte by intrigue;
each placeman, each Sultaness has her creatures, and plots for placing them;
and Versailles has not more intricate intrigue than the Porte. A rebel∣lious
bashaw raises troops and lives in open defiance of the sovereign who
invested him with his authority. There is one at this moment, at the head of
forty thousand men in Albany, who might with the greatest ease make
himself king of a large country—his name is Masmoud, not above thirty
years of age—and he succeeded his father in the government, which he
now holds in defiance of the Porte. Is it to be won∣dered at if the Turk is a
predestinarian in most things, since it is neither birth or abi∣lities
that can give him place or power—nor is there generally any visible
just reason why heads are struck off. There is a re∣cent example here,
proving that the confi∣dence of the Sultan is not the surest way to
escape a sudden and unexpected death. One Petraki, a Greek, a kind of
banker to <PB N="274" REF="283"/> the court, by his frequent access to Achmet,
raised the jealousy of the ministry, who, upon various pretences, one day
in council, desired Petraki's head might fall—</P>
<P>The Sultan, whose private reasons for keeping it on, were
infinitely better than those Petraki's enemies had alledged, was extremely
averse to such a thing; but the Capitan Pacha and his friends were bold
enough to declare, they would not stir out of the council till Achmet had
signed the order; which he did, with the tears stream∣ing down his cheeks.
Upon such occa∣sions, there is a person whose place it is to go to the
house of the unfortunate dead man, and examine the papers of any person who
in his life-time had dealings with the cabinet—</P>
<P>The man found some, which he seal∣ed up with four large seals,
and de∣sired they might be delivered into the <PB N="275" REF="284"/> Sultan's
own hands; very much alarmed at having seen them; for Petraki was the
pri∣vate agent of the Sultan, who received the money, which Petraki seemed
only to re∣ceive for places which his interest pro∣cured; and Petraki's
accounts were so regularly kept, that the money he deli∣vered, with the dates
and the places, were registered—</P>
<P>The vile low intrigues of the ministers here are not to be
imagined. The Sultan has the highest opinion of the sense and courage of
the Capitan Pacha; when he quits Constantinople the Sovereign thinks his
capital in danger. But I find all ranks of people agree in his having
introduced a better police for the town than hitherto existed. At a fire
some Janissaries not do∣ing their duty properly, he had four of them
flung into it. <HI>Pour encourager les autres,</HI> as Voltaire has observed
upon ano∣ther occasion. He is always accompanied by a lion, who follows him
like a dog; the other day he suffered him to accompany him 
<PB N="276" REF="285"/> to the Divau, but the ministers were so terrified
that some jumped out of the windows, one was near breaking his neck in flying
down stairs, and the High Admiral and his lion were left to settle the
councils of the day to∣gether—</P>
<P>I think it a lucky thing for the Am∣bassadors that the Turks
neither pay nor receive visits.—Could any thing be so terrible as the
society of the most ignorant and uninformed men upon earth?</P>
<P>You know, I suppose, that they were always persuaded it was
impossible for a Russian fleet to come to Constantinople by any other
sea than the Black Sea; and though the French endeavoured to prove to them by
maps, the passage of their enemies to the Archipelago; till the Turkish
fleet was engaged with the Russian in the Bay of Tchesme, no Turk would
believe the pos∣sibility of the thing—</P>
<P><PB N="277" REF="286"/> I am told here that a Mr. Bouverie, who
desired to see Constantinople, came and looked at it from the frigate he
was in—but never landed—I really do not think he was to blame.
Constantinople, and the en∣trance of the Bosphorus by the sea of
Mar∣mora, is the most majestic, magnificent, graceful, and lively scene
the most luxuriant imagination can desire to behold.</P>
<P>It was no wonder Constantine chose it for the seat of empire.
Nature has com∣posed of earth and water such a landscape, that taste,
unassisted by ambitious reflecti∣ons, would naturally desire to give
the picture living graces; but I who am apt to suppose whatever is in
possibility to exist, often place along the shore, Petersburgh,
Paris, London, Moscow, Amsterdam, and all the great towns I have seen,
separate from each other, and there is full room enough. Here I will end my
suppositions, and think it better that man has done so little where
nature has done so much—<HI>et que tout est comme il doit etre;</HI>
who ought with more justice to think so; I who have <PB N="273" REF="287"/>
you for my friend and brother. But lest you should not be of the same
opinion as to the length of this letter, I will now take my leave, and

<HEAD>LETTER XLVII.</HEAD>
<P>THE harbour called the Golden Horn, which separates Pera and
Constantinople, has a singularity I wish much to have ex∣plained to me.
All the filth and rubbish of both towns are constantly flung into it;
custom-houses, barracks, store-houses, the dock-yard, all these are
placed on the bor∣ders of it; whole dunghills are swept into it; no
measures for keeping it clean are taken, no quays are formed by men; yet by
the strength or variety of currents, or some other natural cause, this
port is always clean, and deep enough to admit of the en∣trance of the
largest merchantmen; which, like as in all the other harbours in the canal,
may be hooked on, close to the shore—This harbour grows narrower as
it meets the fresh water, and ends at last in a small 
<PB N="280" REF="289"/> rivulet; but where it is just wide enough to have the
appearance of a small river, the French some time past have dammed the
fresh water up, making of it square pieces of water, to imitate those of
Marly. Here kiosks and trees have been placed in great regularity, and it is
here that on a Friday Turks in groupes are to be seen dining, taking coffee,
or smoaking upon carpets, spread under the shade of the immense and
lofty platane. I can give you no other idea of the size of some of these
beautiful trees, but by telling you it corresponds to the gigantic
landscape of which they make the finest ornament; yes, my dear Sir, the
largest oaks you can have seen would look, set down by these, as little
broomsticks. Women in groupes likewise, apart from the men, meet here; but
when they come to these places, of which there are a great number near
Constantinople, they hire what they imagine to be coaches, called
<HI>arabats</HI>—A vile machine like a covered cart, with rows of benches
in the inside There are no springs to them; and one day in a valley called
<HI>l' Echelle du grand Seigneur,</HI> I <PB N="281" REF="290"/> got into one,
but chose rather to get out and walk six miles, than be jolted
unmer∣cifully. All the Ambassadors since my arrival here have given balls
and dinners. Madame d'Herbert, the Imperial Minister's wife, is lively, and I
see her often. The Dutch Ambassador's wife is a very good woman; and I am
very comfortable, think∣ing people extremely good to me to answer the million
of questions I ask. There is but one person here to whom I never ap∣ply
about any thing; for I observe a shifted smile upon every person's
countenance when he opens his lips; his long residence here has given the
other —</P>
<P>So if his details to the — cabinet are as true as those in
society—the business of the nation will go on admirably —</P>
<P><PB N="282" REF="291"/> By the by, Sir, I forgot to tell you I found
Sir Richard Worsley here, who has travelled much, with a person to take
views for him. He shewed me a coloured draw∣ing of the castle of Otranto;
which, said he, I intend to present to Mr. W—; and pray, Sir, says
I, are you an acquaint∣ance of his? <HI>No;</HI> upon which I hesitated not
to ask him for it; that I as a friend of W—'s may have the pleasure
of giving it to him. He intreated me to accept of some Egyptian pebbles, as
knife handles—and I obtained for him a permission to go in the
frigate, that brought me hither, to the Crimea—</P>
<P>I am told there is an English merchant here extremely offended at
my loding <HI>au Palais de France,</HI> and says, if Sir R. Ainstie's
house was not good enough for me, he had a new house, which he would have
emptied, and let me have had it all to myself—It is an affront to the
<HI>nation,</HI> he says—<HI>A peeress of England to lodge at the
French Ambas∣sador's!</HI>—The English merchants are very 
<PB N="283" REF="292"/> good to me; I believe they guess the respect and
esteem I have for them—</P>
<P>Mr. de Bukalow sent me a few days past one of Merlin's finest
piano-fortes, to re∣main here as long as I stay; and Mr. de Choiseul found
out a pedal-harp somewhere, and had it set in my room—I believe
peo∣ple think it so singular a thing for a lady to come here without being
obliged, as a minister's wife, that they endeavour to keep me as long as they
can; Mr. d'Herbert told me —</P>
<P>I repeat this to you, Sir, that you may know at least that
—</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XLVIII.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT would seem that every thing in nature which has remarkable
advantages, has like∣wise some misfortunes attending it that counterbalance
the good, so as to reduce the portion of happiness to a level for man∣kind.
This beautiful enchanting country, the climate, the objects, the situation of
it, make it an earthly Paradise; but the plague—but
earthquakes—what terrifying sub∣jects, to make the thinking part fly it
for ever. If things and persons may be compa∣red, it is not a beautiful
woman, who is handsomer than most of her sex, with ac∣complishments
equal to her beauty; but whom the world, her very inmates envy those
advantages—and might not the base <PB N="285" REF="294"/> passions
that surround her frighten her greatest admirers from trusting to her
be∣witching charms—</P>
<P>I was led to this comparison by talking about the Grecian
Islands, which I mean to visit—they are all I am told volcanos;
some of them have disappeared; and those who have furnished Greece with
their men of greatest genius, only like them, are to be found in books; and
by an adventure which happened to us yesterday, as we em∣barked at Tophana.
There are small plat∣forms of wood fixed on to the edge of the water, where
people leave or take boats. As we arrived a boat full of Turks landed with a
corpse, seemingly in great haste, and as they passed, touched Mons
de Choi∣seul and me. He started, and I asked him what was the
matter—He told me he was sure it was a man dead of the plague; and in
truth it was so. Judge how disagreeable to one who had not been out for
six months—</P>
<P><PB N="286" REF="295"/> I have been to see the Mosque of St.
So∣phia, with two others. The dome of St. Sophia is extremely large, and well
worth seeing, but some of the finest pillars are set topsy-turvy, or
have capitals of Turkish architecture. In these holy temples neither the
beautiful statues belonging to Pagan times, nor the costly ornaments of
modern Rome, are to be seen: some shabby lamps, hung irregularly, are the
only expence the Mahometans permit themselves, as a proof of their respect
for the Deity or his Prophet. I went and sat some time up stairs, to look
down into the body of the temple—I saw several Turks and women
kneeling, and seemingly praying with great devotion. Mosques are
constantly open; and I could not help reflecting that their mode of
wor∣ship is extremely convenient for the carry∣ing on a plot of any sort. A
figure, wrap∣ped up like a mummy, can easily kneel down by another without
being suspected, and mutter in a whisper any sort of thing; the longer
the conversation lasts the more edified a silent observer may be. No
par∣ticular hour for divine service, or person to <PB N="287" REF="296"/>
officiate, is appointed. It is true, that at certain hours of the day men are
seen on the minarets or steeples, bawling and hal∣looing to all good
Mussulmen, that it is the hour appointed for prayer; but they follow their
own convenience or devout humour, and say their prayers not only when but
where they choose—for I have seen several Turks, in the most
public and noisy places about Constantinople, kneeling and praying, without
being the least deranged or disturb∣ed by the variety of objects or
noises that surrounded or passed by them. In order to procure me a
sight of the Mosques, the Ambassador was obliged to apply for a
permission; the Porte graciously gave one; in which I had leave to see
seventy-five. The burial places for the dead are very nu∣merous, and in a
manner surround Con∣stantinople and Pera, forming very shady romantic
walks, as the trees and grave-stones are huddled together in a confused
manner; both presenting great variety to those who ramble among them. Each
grave-stone is crowned with a turban, the form of which shews the
employment or <PB N="288" REF="297"/> quality of the corpse when
living—I shall send you a drawing that will give you some idea of
them—</P>
<P>I can give you no just idea of the beauty of the trees; which,
particularly in these burial places, are never touched, therefore spread
and grow in the most luxuriant and graceful disorder. There are no bounds
set, or fences to restrain or design the form of these burial places,
some extend a mile or two; and, if it was not for one disagreeable
reflexion, would be as pleasant to a foreign∣er as to a Turk; but when we
consider that it is pestiferated earth we tread on; that every new made
grave may contain a body rotting with the plague, and the slight man∣ner in
which it is covered with earth, from the hurry with which it is thrown in, we
cannot with reason stay therein. Turks are predestinarians, and therefore
imagine it is fate, and not the care which is taken in Christian houses
that prevents them from dying of this horrid disorder; therefore walk
unconcerned, under the dangerous shade of the trees that hang over their
deceased neighbours—</P>
<P><PB N="289" REF="298"/> Constantinople is almost surrounded by
a very high wall, turreted and flanked by large square towers, built by the
Greek Emperors—the style of architecture exactly like that of Warwick
and Berkeley Castle; but many of the square towers, which serve as
gateways, are mouldering away under the negligence of the Turks; most of whom
believe in an ancient prophecy, which announces that the time is near when the
Empress of Russia is to make her public and triumphal entry through one
of these towers, as Empress of Greece, into Con∣stantinople. Many have
made up their minds, and taken their measures to transport themselves
across the Bosphorus into Asia; nay, some go so far as to point to
the very identical gateway through which she is to proceed. To some nations
it would be very agreeable that the Turkish empire was to be driven from a
situation, which seems by nature formed as an universal passage for
trading nations, which the inactivity of the Turks has too long obstructed.
And it is to be wished by all those who bear any res∣pect to the best
monuments of sculpture, <PB N="290" REF="299"/> that Athens, and all it yet
contains, might not by Mahometan ignorance be entirely destroyed: at
present, ruins, that would adorn a virtuoso's cabinet, are daily burnt into
lime by the Turks; and pieces of ex∣quisite workmanship stuck into a wall
or fountain. There remains but a very little of that pillar that once probably
was a fine ornament to the Atmeidan, or market for horses.</P>
<P>I have seen likewise the Sultan go in ce∣remony to
prayers—from the gate of the Seraglio to the door of the
Mosque—it was but a few paces. He was preceded by a double row of
Janissaries, to the amount of about an hundred and fifty, with other
at∣tendants; he was mounted on a grey horse led by two persons, and
followed by his son, a sickly looking child, sitting on a milk-white
horse; over his head was held a green umbrella, the ribs of which were set
with diamonds. You must know diamonds are the things which the Turks are
most fond of. While the Porte delays erecting batteries upon the most
important posts, under the <PB N="291" REF="300"/> pretence of wanting money
to pay for the pieces and work necessary for the defence of the empire, the
jewellers cannot find diamonds enough to supply the demands of the Harem, for
which they are paid ready money. It is the quantity, and not the quality of
this stone, which they prize: scarcely any other than rose diamonds are
to be seen here—</P>
<P>I have been with a large party to see the Captain Pacha's wife,
but as this letter will not contain an account of this curious visit, I
must defer my account of it to the next. Believe me, Sir, with the truest
esteem and affection,</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XLIX.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>PALAIS DE FRANCE, PERA, 
<DATE>May 7, 1786.</DATE></DATELINE> 
<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>MONSIEUR de Choiseul proposed to the Ambassadors wives and
me to go and see the Capitan Pacha's country seat; accord∣ingly we set
out with several carriages, and about a league from Constantinople,
to∣wards Romelia, we arrived there: The house and plantations about it are
new and irregular. The Ambassadors and the rest of the male party were
suffered to walk in the garden; but the Minister's wives and myself were
shewn into a separate building from the house, where the ground floor was
made to contain a great quantity of water, and looked like a large clean
cistern. We then were led up stairs, and upon the land∣ing-place, which was
circular, the doors of <PB N="293" REF="302"/> several rooms were open. In
some there was nothing to be seen, in others two or three women sitting
close together; in one, a pretty young woman, with a great quan∣tity of
jewels on her turban, was sitting al∣most in the lap of a frightful negro
woman; we were told she was the Capitan Pacha's sister-in-law; she
looked at us with much surprise; and at last, with great fear, threw
herself into the arms of the Black woman, as if to hide herself. We were
called away into a larger room than any we had seen, where the Capitan
Pacha's wife, a middle∣aged woman, dressed with great magnifi∣cence,
received us with much politeness; many women were with her, and she had by
her a little girl, dressed as magnificently as herself, her adopted
child. She made an excuse for not receiving us at the door, as she was
dining with her husband when we arrived. Coffee, sherbet, and sweetmeats
were offered, and we hastened to take our leave, as our cavaliers were
cooling their heels in the garden.</P>
<P><PB N="294" REF="303"/> You can conceive nothing so neat and clean
to all appearance as the interior of this Harem; the floors and passages
are cover∣ed with matting of a close and strong kind; the colour of the
straw or reeds with which they are made is a pale straw. The rooms had no
other furniture than the cushions, which lined the whole room, and those,
with the curtains, were of white linen. As the Turks never come into the room,
either men or women, with the slippers they walk abroad with there is not a
speck of sand or dirt within doors. I am <HI>femmelette</HI> enough to have
taken particular notice of the dress, which, if female envy did not spoil
every thing in the world of women, would be graceful. It consists of a
petticoat and vest, over which is worn a robe with short sleeves; the one
belonging to the lady of the house was of sattin, embroidered richly with
the finest colours, gold and diamonds—A girdle under that, with two
circles of jewels in front, and from this gir∣dle hangs an embroidered
handkerchief—A turban with a profusion of diamonds and pearls, seemed
to weigh this lady's head <PB N="295" REF="304"/> down; but what spoiled the
whole was a piece of ermine, that probably was origi∣nally only a cape, but
each woman increa∣sing the size of it, in order to be more mag∣nificent
than her neighbour, they now have it like a great square plaister that
comes down to the hips; and these simple igno∣rant beings do not see that
it disfigures the <HI>tout ensemble</HI> of a beautiful dress. The hair is
separated in many small braids hang∣ing down the back, or tied up to the
point of the turban on the outside. I have no doubt but that nature intended
some of these women to be very handsome, but white and red ill applied,
their eye-brows hid under one or two black lines—teeth black by
smoaking, and an universal stoop in the shoulders, made them appear
rather disgusting than handsome. The last defect is caused by the
posture they sit in, which is that of a taylor, from their
infancy—</P>
<P>The black powder with which they line their eyelids gives their eyes
likewise a harsh expression. Their questions are as simple as their
dress is studied—Are you marri∣ed? <PB N="296" REF="305"/> Have you
children? Have you no disorder? Do you like Constantinople? The Turkish
women pass most of their time in the bath or upon their dress; strange
pastimes! The first spoils their persons, the last disfigures them.
The frequent use of hot-baths destroys the solids, and these women at
nineteen look older than I am at this moment. They endeavour to repair by art
the mischief their constant soaking does to their charms; but till some
one, more wise than the rest, finds out the cause of the premature decay
of that inva∣luable gift, beauty, and sets an example to the rising
generation of a different mode of life, they will always fade as fast as the
roses they are so justly fond of—</P>
<P>Our gentlemen were very curious to hear an account of the Harem, and
when we were driving out of the court-yard, a mes∣senger from the Harem
came running after us, to desire the carriages might be driven round the
court two or three times, for the amusement of the Capitan Pacha's wife and
the Harem, that were looking through <PB N="297" REF="306"/> the blinds; this
ridiculous message was not complied with, as you may imagine; and we got
home, laughing at our adventures.</P>
<P>You must not suppose that carriages may proceed in the
streets of Pera, or Constan∣tinople, as fast as in those of London or
Paris. A race of dogs, belonging to no one in particular but to every Turk
indifferent∣ly, swarm in the streets; and so accustom∣ed are they to
have the Turks on horseback turn out of the middle of the street, where

carriages and lift the dogs out of the way, several times, be∣fore we reached
the <HI>Palais de France.</HI> No∣thing is more horrible than the species of
this animal here, all of the same race, an ugly currish breed; nothing more
absurd than the general protection afforded them; on every dunghill you may
see a hundred fighting and scrambling for the filth they can scratch out
of it; for the ill-understood charity, publickly given them, is by no means
sufficient to feed them, and many hundreds die with hunger. No man has a

lie and breed about the streets. Turtle-doves are likewise an object of
respect with the Turks, and they are seen disput∣ing the crumbs with the

<HEAD>LETTER L.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Have seen a very horrible sight, though not a new one to
those who inhabit Con∣stantinople or Pera. Yesterday I went upon the
Canal to see the departure of the Capitan Pacha, commanding the Turkish
fleet, which set sail for Egypt; and at night a most dreadful fire broke
out in Constan∣tinople, probably kindled by the partizans of the commander,
in order to persuade the Sultan that in the absence of this favourite, he
is not in the same security as when he is at present—</P>
<P>You may be surprised at this supposition, but nothing is
more frequent than tricks of this kind: I went up with the Ambassador and
many more persons into the Observa∣tory, and staid till three in the
morning, <PB N="300" REF="309"/> to make my remarks. The houses are like
tinder, and burn as fast as matches from their slight construction and
the material which is wood. The scene of horror and confu∣sion was great,
and though the fire began at the edge of the water, and the Janissaries
were very diligent, above seventy houses were burnt presently—</P>
<P>The Sultan, when he wants to make the common people believe he has
no fears, goes out incognito, in a hired boat with only two or three
attendants. I had seen him come out thus of a back-door of his garden, just
after the fleet had sailed; the fire at night was calculated to renew his
fears, if he had lost them. But here it is known when he sallies forth
without guards and ceremony: it is like children that sing in the dark, to
make their nurses believe they are not afraid—</P>
<P>Upon new buildings or children, the Turks imagine the looks of
Christians bring ill luck—and so to attract what they call the
<HI>evil fight,</HI> upon arches or houses they sus∣pend 
<PB N="301" REF="310"/> a ball, or some fantastic thing to fix the attention
of those who pass, in order that the eyes may not be fixed too long on the
building. As to children, particularly the Sultan's, the guards hide them when
Christian men or women would look at them—</P>
<P>All this is very childish indeed; but there are a thousand
superstitious ideas the Turks have relative to the Franks, which is the
name by which they distinguish every one who wears an European dress.
Among others, they imagine them to have an in∣tuitive knowledge in
physic—and ask Chris∣tians oftener to give them a cure for
disor∣ders than any other question.</P>
<P>The red leather pocket-books, embroi∣dered with gold so neatly,
and which you may have seen, are to be had cheap here; half-a-guinea or
fifteen shillings is the high∣est price for them: I shall send you one
or two, and beg you will keep my letters to you in them. I know, dear Sir, the
mag∣nificent <PB N="302" REF="311"/> outside of them will not please you
half so well as the simple scrawl within—</P>
<P>Among many absurdities the Turks are guilty of, there is one for
which I see no reason. The Sultans formerly built diffe∣rent palaces on the
borders of the Canal, which are now forsaken. There is one on the Asiatic
side in the midst of a fine gar∣den, falling to ruin very fast: In it
there are yet costly looking-glasses and furniture, these are not
removed but suffered to fall and perish as it may please the winds and
ruin to direct. As no one is to touch or remove any thing, the Porte and public
are equally losers; the garden, large enough to make a beautiful park, is
quite wild; and as no one goes into it, one of the finest spots on that
coast, just facing the Seraglio, is lost to every one. I find this is the
case with every royal residence, which, when abandoned by the caprice of
the sovereign, is not demolished or unfurnished, but left in the same
manner—</P>
<P>If there are many simple and absurd cus∣toms and opinions
among the Turks, there <PB N="303" REF="312"/> exists likewise much
generosity and magni∣ficence in their conduct when in an opulent situation.
No minister of the Porte has an interview with a foreign ambassador, or
stranger of any rank, without making pre∣sents; which these return
according to their opulence, or inclination to be noble. Mr. de Choiseul will
not avail himself of this op∣portunity of becoming rich, for I am told he
never receives any thing without giving in return a present of double the
value; and I am sure more from the noble disposi∣tion of his own mind,
than for the honour of his King and country—though both in him would
weigh greatly towards this con∣duct. It is not so with — and
—</P>
<P>You see nothing is more easy here than for a Minister to
<HI>make money</HI> of <HI>interviews,</HI> and turn political conversations
into <HI>solid gold—</HI></P>
<P><PB N="304" REF="313"/> The Turks in their conduct towards our sex
are an example to all other nations. A Turk has his head cut off—his
papers are examined—every thing in his house seized—but the
wife is provided for; her jewels are left her—</P>
<P>The Harem is sacred even to that rapaci∣ous power which has
seized the master's life, only because he was rich. It may be said,
that in Turkey likewise, women are perfectly safe from an idle, curious,
imper∣tinent public, and what is called the <HI>world</HI> can never disturb
the ease and quiet of a Turkish wife. Her talents, her beauty, her
happiness, or misery, are equally concealed from malicious observers. Of
misery, un∣less a Turkish woman is beyond conception unreasonable, I
cannot imagine that her portion can be great; for the wife whose wretched
husband earns subsistence by car∣rying water, or burthens, sits at
home be∣decked with jewels, or goes out as her fan∣cy directs, and the fruits
of his labour are appropriated to her use. In great houses, the wives of
the Turks, who compose the <PB N="305" REF="314"/> train of a Turkish
husband, are destined to be subservient to the state of the first
wife, and she treats them as she pleases in her Harem. According to what
I hear, a Turkish husband does not care for his wife, as the object of his
passion, except for a very short space of time; but as wife she
enjoys all the luxury of his fortune; and I repeat it, Sir, I think no women
have so much li∣berty, safe from apprehension, as the Turkish—and
I think them, in their man∣ner of living, capable of being the happiest
creatures breathing.</P>
<P>I have been to see two Greek brides in Constantinople: Their
custom is to receive every body who has any curiosity to see their
wedding clothes. These were very magni∣ficent, and the women pretty; and
looked prettier from a singular contrast in the turn of their features. One
had a true Greek face, her head small, her nose straight, large blue
eyes, with dark or rather black eyelids and hair, and her eyebrows straight;
her neck long and round, her person rather inclining to lean than fat; a
soft and sad <PB N="306" REF="315"/> countenance. The other was fattish;
had black lively eyes, with a chearful laughing countenance, her blood seemed
to ebb and flow with more vivacity than her sister's-in-law. Her mouth,
rather large, shewed a fine set of teeth, while the one with a smaller
mouth and prettier teeth, seemed as unwilling to shew them, or light up her
fine features with smiles, as the black-eyed bride was ready to laugh upon
every or no occasion. They had both very little red on, and the pallid skin
of the delicate Greek was perfectly suited to the form of the one—the
other blushed often. They might have served for good models of the Tragic
and Comic Muse. I would Sir Joshua had been at my elbow, his compositions
are fine enough to satisfy a youthful poet's imagi∣nation, but here his
pencil might not have disdained to copy two such charming origi∣nals. It is
a very rare thing in this country to find fair or auburn hair. I am told if a
slave can be bought with such—many more purses are given for them
than for any other. A large sum of money here is reckoned by purses. Adieu
for the present, dear Sir—<PB N="307" REF="316"/> may you receive have
the satisfaction in reading my letters, that I feel in devoting my solitary

<P>YOU must not suppose, my dear Sir, that I am so delighted
with the scene before me, that I mean not to avail myself of being so
near the Grecian Islands. I had consulted Mr. de Choiseul upon the best
method of hiring a vessel, but the difficulties were so great that, with
his usual goodness and po∣liteness, he has sound a method of
oblite∣rating them all by lending me a little frigate called the Tarleton, of
fourteen guns, com∣manded by a very pleasant civil little man, and his
friend, Mr. de Truguet; this little frigate is English built, and was taken
in America. Mons de Choiseul, whose health requires the hot-baths of
Bursa, is to ac∣company <PB N="309" REF="318"/> us to the port of Moudagna,
and when he is landed safely, I shall sail for the places which he, as
the best director I can have, will order: I shall take two of his artists
with me, and in all things be guided by him. You see, Sir, my happy star is
then to permit me to see places in an agree∣able manner, with less
difficulty, and more comfort than generally falls to the lot of one person.
Some old <HI>wise</HI> observer says, a <HI>single</HI> misfortune
never comes alone: I may say so of pleasant circumstances—</P>
<P>I should imagine the different stile of life here to that in
Europe must influence Mr. de Choiseul's spirits, and of course his
health. I cannot call this a social place, the Am∣bassadors are totally
confined for conversa∣tion or society to themselves, and you know very
well, it is not being incorporated into the <HI>corps diplomatique</HI> that
gives a person the qualities necessary to make them good company. The
different interests of their different courts must inevitably make them
disagree in public matters, and that disa∣greement <PB N="310" REF="319"/>
may produce reserve in private life. I shall give you a sketch of all the
Ministers at present here —</P>
<P>And now, Sir, we will turn to the Greeks, which are as numerous as
the Turks here. The remains or rather renovation of Greek beauty is often to be
seen among them, but their patriotic spirit seems all centered in this
age, in a violent attachment to the borders of the Canal. It is always among
them that a prince is named by the Porte to reign in Moldavia and Wallachia;
they stay generally three years, and retire with great fortunes, which they
lay out in houses and gardens in the neighbourhood of Constanti∣nople,
where they are pretty sure they shall not be suffered to die in peace,
but are generally beheaded; repeated examples do <PB N="311" REF="320"/> not
deter them from staying, and leading a life of continual fear. They conceal
as much as possible their riches, but the Se∣raglio has good spies, and
these wretched Greeks are absolutely, through a just fear, prisoners in
their own houses. It seems possible that the sight of the Bosphorus
makes up to them for the loss of every other pleasure. A strange
infatuation, when there is another empire whose religion is theirs, where
they would meet with protec∣tion, and into which they might retire with their
fortunes—</P>
<P>I saw the other day the public departure of a new named Prince for
Wallachia. The procession was very fine, his own court and guards, with
many escorts from the Porte, preceded and followed him two by two, a great
number of horses, Janissaries, and cooks—the horses coverings
were of cloth of gold or rich embroideries; two white horses tails on
sticks, and a kind of cap like a helmet, the emblem of his dignity, were
carried before him. He was an elderly <PB N="312" REF="321"/> man, and knowing
the Ambassador, he looked up at the windows where we were sitting, and
nodded. This <HI>cortége</HI> lasted a long time, and was really as
fine a processi∣on as ever I saw. This Prince calls himself Nicolai
Morezzind, he is originally of the Island of Naxia—and he has taken a
name that is not his own, because it is a better one with the
Porte—</P>
<P>The lyre of the ancients is often to be seen in the hands of the
Greeks; but I suppose in ancient days, as in these, whatever harmony
possessed their souls, it affected only their eyes. From the lyre, or
from any miserable fiddle or guit∣tar they touch they only draw the most
abominable discordant sounds, that accom∣pany a kind of bawling, which they
fancy is singing. Indeed music is a thing of which Turks and Greeks have
not the least idea—</P>
<P>I am sure you wish me prosperous gales, and I will write from
the first place I can <PB N="313" REF="322"/> find any conveyance for a letter
to reach you—</P>

<P>I Intended not to have written before I reached the Trojan coast
at least, but as some account of the Sultan will not be un∣interesting, I
shall tell you what I have heard. He is extremely fearful, <HI>timid,</HI>
and igno∣rant, totally unable to quell the interested little intrigues of his
ministers, and direct the interior policy of his cabinet or empire. His
excessive ignorance makes it impossible for him to imagine it
necessary he should be acquainted with any thing out of
Constan∣tinople. He has an implicit faith in Hassan, the admiral or
Capitan Pacha—that man's personal bravery being a kind of refuge for
the Sultan's fears. The body of Janissaries sometimes make a
revolt—several governors of provinces or Pachas have revolted at one
time—fires are so frequent in Constantino∣ple—and 
<PB N="315" REF="324"/> at present the Russian cabinet is so
<HI>exigeant,</HI> that the moment is not far off when the Turks must be
trampled upon, or break out with an honest indignation. There is a large
party now murmuring loudly against the patience of the Porte; amidst this
confusion is it to be wondered at that a man who has never been out of the
Seraglio, of course less resolute than half the women in it, should
tremble on his throne?</P>
<P>Selim, his nephew, who is to succeed him, is about
six-and-twenty, and I am told has an understanding that breaks through the
effeminate education he has received. Among other proofs of his being of a
reso∣lute disposition, as soon as he knew the hor∣rid custom of
strangling every infant which is born in the Seraglio, not the child of the
reigning Sultan, he declared he would never be the cause of a human
creature's death; and has constantly avoided any opportuni∣ties of becoming a
father.</P>
<P><PB N="316" REF="325"/> To night all the people who have been
presented to me came to wish me a safe and pleasant voyage — come
in, looking as like the Cousin Hogres∣ten, as possible, and assured
me the Islands of Naxos and Smyrna were ravaged by the plague at this moment;
and that the rocks and storms in the Archipelago were the most dangerous in
the world; that he wish∣ed me a safe return, but my intended voyage was
very perilous. A stifled smile upon some people's faces, and the
settled reputa∣tion he has for invention, made me perfect∣ly easy, and if
his intention was to render me otherwise, it has failed thoroughly; nor could
we refrain from laughing when this Hogresten took his leave—</P>
<P>The Venetian Ambassador here is a very sensible man, but he
dislikes his post; his passion is Rome; where he might sollow his
taste for the fine arts. He is very conver∣sible, and I dare say feels,
as Mons. de Choiseul must, like the Prince in the Ara∣bian 
<PB N="317" REF="326"/> Nights, who landed in a country where all the
inhabitants were turned into stone; for indeed a nation with which one does
not associate, is a nation of statues to strangers who are forced to
remain in it, except that the people walk, ride, and go in boats—</P>
<P>Mr. de Choiseul has some excellent mu∣sicians, and we have had
concerts; there are ladies that sing, but according to my usual shyness
about music, I shall let no one here know I can — for — and
so remaining—I wish you a good night—</P>

<P>I Set out on the 12th, at half past six in the evening, on board
the Tarleton, which contained Mr. de Choiseul and great part of his
household, myself, my fellow-tra∣veller, and the officers; how this little
fri∣gate contained us all I do not know, but so it was, and all our
servants. It was the finest weather in the world, and we passed those
islands, called the Princes, to the left, which are seven miles and a half
from Con∣stantinople; from those to Cape Bourbou∣ron, which is the
promontory of land that forms part of the port of Moudagna, it is
four-and-twenty miles and a half; from Cape Bourbouron to the port of Moudagna,
thirteen. As we had but little wind, we did not make these four-and-forty
miles <PB N="319" REF="328"/> and a half in less than seventeen hours; and
after having landed our sick but amia∣ble Ambassador, we set sail
again, and when fairly out at sea, we had a most vio∣lent storm, and with
difficulty saved our∣selves from the Island of Marmora, a most
tremendous naked rock, which seems only placed in the midst of that sea
to re∣ceive a wreck from a thunder-storm. I was heartily sick and tired,
for the shaking of so small a vessel shocks my slight person
most horridly. When we were just over against the Trojan shore, I would
fain have landed, but as there is nothing to see on the surface of the
ground, and we had not time to stay, and dig for the ashes of the heroes'
buried there, we contented ourselves with supposing what we might have
found; we deplored Leander's fate as we passed the Straits, and found there
the Capitan-Pacha and his fleet: our little frigate saluted him, he returned
our salutation. We passed the western points of the Islands of
Mittelina and Ipsera, leaving to the left the Island of Scio; to the right
that of Miconia, and the little <PB N="320" REF="329"/> one of Dragonissa,
and landed at the Island of Naxia or Naxos. I saw but little re∣mains of
the temple dedicated to Bacchus, which stands on the point of a rock, which
probably was part of the island when the temple was built; at present one
must scram∣ble in a boat to reach that point where it stands; a fine
proportion gives room to sup∣pose it might have been very majestic. I was
shewn the fountain beside which it is said the forsaken Ariadne wept
her lover's flight, and where Bacchus found her; it is of white marble, too
much destroyed by time to admit of description, and contains a spring of
clear water.</P>
<P>The town of Naxos is a poor place; we waited near four hours to
see a Naxiote maiden dressed in her holiday clothes, which are neither
decent nor pretty: A short shift reaching to her knees served as a
petticoat; her vest was fantastic beyond conception, pearls, feathers,
beads, sowed on, in vari∣ous forms; and two wings like those of a
butterfly, stuck between her shoulders, added to the strange appearance.
Her head <PB N="321" REF="330"/> and neck were adorned with gold, chains,
pearls, stones, ribbands; in my life I never saw so bizarre a figure. We
took our leave of her, making many excuses for the trou∣ble we had given her,
and sailed for the small island of Antiparos, which is to the right of
Paros, where I could plainly disco∣ver the mouths of several quarries of
that famous marble, of which, had I possessed a fairy's wand, I would
have conveyed large blocks to England, and laid them at the feet of my friend
Mrs. Damer, whose talent for sculpture makes her as distinguished in
that art as in every other which she has chosen to profess—though
her modesty has concealed many from the world—</P>
<P>Mr. de Choiseul's artists were to take as∣tronomical and
geometrical observations of the famous grotto, and I had promised to
descend into it with them. An ass led by two Greeks was waiting on the
shore for me, as the heat was excessive, and my com∣panions were afraid I
should be too much fatigued if I had walked. Indeed it was a league distant
from the shore, and we as∣cended <PB N="322" REF="331"/> constantly;
turning suddenly to the left, we descended a little, and a scene truly
romantic offered itself; a vaulted semicircle formed by craggy rocks,
some bearing the appearance of pillars, which seemed to support the
pendant roof, and caverns which afforded a refreshing shade to diffe∣rent
flocks of goats which the Greek shep∣herds had driven in, and were resting
by, was an object worthy the pencil of my companions—</P>
<P>Here we rested, and a small hole on the ground was pointed to me
as the entrance of the grotto. I was obliged to crawl in, a strong cord was
fastened to the outside, and several sailors and Greeks preceded us
with flambeaux; it required a good deal of courage and dexterity to proceed,
sometimes I sat, and slid down small points of rock, which were the
only support for hands or seet; in two places the descent was
perpen∣dicular; there rope ladders were fastened, and in one or two places,
through holes on the left, we could look down perpendicu∣larly into the grotto,
where I arrived safely, <PB N="323" REF="332"/> refusing constantly to be
assisted, for I thought myself in greater safety in trusting to my
own hands and feet than to the as∣sistance of others, who had enough to
do in preventing themselves from slipping—</P>
<P>Tournefort says the grotto is three hun∣dred fathoms perpendicular
from the en∣trance; it is three hundred feet only; but as there are several
windings in the passage, in times when mathematical calculations were in
less perfection than at present, the mistake was an easy one. The
feeble de∣scription my pen may trace of this famous grotto I must defer at
present; I yet remem∣ber with pleasure its gloomy freshness, and the
sweet spring of soft water we found in one corner of it, that made us
relish our cold collation with much pleasure. My patient contemplation of
objects, which the silent and cold hand of time only can pro∣duce, was very
favourable to the artist who was taking a drawing of the interior of the
grotto, intended for Mr. de Choiseul's se∣cond volume of his publication,
<HI>du Voyage Pittoresque de la Grece,</HI> where I am to be seated at the
foot of what they call <HI>le</HI> <PB N="324" REF="333"/> <HI>Grand Autel.</HI>
Would, my dear and ho∣noured friend, you had been sitting by my side, for!
fear no pen or pencil can do justice to the immensity of objects I saw,
nor the beauty of them. When I recollect the coolness of my seat, I feel
the more fa∣tigued with the almost insupportable heat of this place, so I
quit my pen—</P>

<P>THE water, which distils drop by drop constantly from the top of
the grotto, hard∣ens, and by degrees the first drop acquires a
consistency like a brittle and thin shell; the the next extends round the
first, so that upon breaking off and examining the pen∣dent point, at the
end of which there was constantly a drop of clear water, it resem∣bles many
glass quills that are made to go within each other; the last forming a more
considerable circle than that hardened to precede it. These are of a
beautiful colour like alabaster. The altars and pillars which rise from the
ground upwards, some of them being taller than the tallest men, are of a
different colour to those which descend, a greyish brown, and seemingly
more hard than the hardest stone; but evidently <PB N="326" REF="335"/>
caused by the dropping of the water like∣wise; and it must be a curious
speculation for naturalists to explain why the same matter, in the same
atmosphere, should, in their congelation, produce such different
petrifactions; the cause seems perfectly natural to me; for the first is
suspended, and as it were congeals in the air, while the other rests upon
the rock, and settles gra∣dually into stone, like sand in the bowels of
the earth.</P>
<P>When the Russian fleet was here, some of the officers broke
off some glorious pil∣lars, which by a slow process, and proba∣bly by the
distillations going in the same perpendicular line downwards for ages, had
reached from the top to the bottom of the <HI>grande salle</HI>—I saw
them in a very imper∣fect state at Petersburgh, and in the grotto the tops
and bottoms of them; for the ma∣terial being so brittle they could not be
broken off in their length. If the Empress could know how little
satisfaction the curi∣ous must receive by seeing them in an im∣perfect
and mutilated state in her Museum—<PB N="327" REF="336"/> and what
beautiful things they must have been in the grotto—she would grieve
with me, that ever a desire of obliging could in∣duce her officers to commit
what I think a sacrilege against antiquity. Nothing can be more beautiful
than the shapes the chrysta∣lisations have taken in some parts of the
ceiling, if I may so call it, of this place—Wherever by any accident
the congealing drop has been removed from its direction, it takes another
course—As there are mil∣lions constantly oozing out and congealing,
some of which are removed accidentally, the petrifactions represent the
folds of dra∣pery curtains, hanging festoons, &amp;c. As to the altars, as
the French call them, which mount spirally towards the cieling, their ends
have been deranged likewise, and wherever the congelation has ceased at the
point, it is like a cauliflower head; and most of them look like pyramids
composed of cauliflowers, supposing them to be brown; the contrast of
this form, as well as the colour of the superior part, is a great addition to
the beauty of the place. After the drawings were taken, the measures 
<PB N="328" REF="337"/> ascertained, and the artists had perfectly
finished what Mons. de Choiseul had com∣manded them to do, we searched
in every corner of the grotto, and found another chamber lower than that we
were in, with several recesses unsuspected by us; names were engraven
on the most conspicuous parts of the <HI>grande salle,</HI> and we left
ours engraved in the rock, and burnt into a board, for any bold adventurer to
read after us—and reascended, but with much more difficulty than we had
entered, for one of the rope-ladders was so contrived that I could not reach
from one step while my foot was on the other; how I scrambled up at last
I cannot very well tell—but I was not sorry to see the light of the
sun again—I was now much surprised to find myself sur∣rounded
by Greek peasant women, one pointing to her head, another to her sto∣mach,
a third to her arm, all bewailing their ill state of health, and touching my
clothes with devotion—I found at last, that hearing a woman had
descended, they took her to be a supernatural being, and was perfectly
convinced I could cure all disor∣ders; <PB N="329" REF="338"/> nor could I
<HI>tirer myself d'affaire,</HI> other∣wise than by distributing some
thieves vinegar which I had in my pocket—</P>
<P>One of the most singular scenes I ever saw, was the
descending of about five-and-twenty people after I was at the bottom of the
grotto, most of them with torches; as there was but one rope to hold by, when
we were obliged to have recourse to it, I insisted that only five people
should go down with me—and the rest set out when we were safely
landed, lest the rope should break. As the passage to the <HI>grande
salle</HI> is winding, and as there are many gaps in it, we caught and lost
sight of these people alternately and of the torches—The brilli∣ancy
of the petrifactions, the jagged shapes of the rocks, through which we saw
the men, the darkness of part of the grotto, and the illuminations which
reflected light in new places every moment, displayed the strangest and
most beautiful scencry that can be imagined. Doubtless, my dear Sir,
there are many observations, easy to make, which my ignorance prevents me
from at∣taining <PB N="330" REF="339"/> to, but you will be amply satisfied,
when Mr. de Choiseul's account of this grotto shall appear—</P>
<P>He has promised me two copies of his works; and there his pencil
will give you a better idea of this remarkable curiosity than my pen
possibly can. And now I confess to you, that had it not been that my
pride rose superior to my fears, I never should have gone down. Mr. de
C—, when we were laying out the plan of my Grecian tour, said,
<HI>Jamais femme n'a descen∣due dans la grotte d' Antiparos, peu d'hommes
veulent y descendre; mais vous, Miladi vous, il faut absolument que vous y
entriez.</HI> When I had got about two or three yards into the narrow entrance
of the cavern, the smoke of the torches, which could only find issue
there, almost took my breath away, and I was forced to set myself down,
or rather lie upon the rock—as I fell almost suffo∣cated—and I
was upon the point of going out again: but I should have been ashamed to
have seen the spirited Ambassador, who had ran so many risques in
searching <PB N="331" REF="340"/> after the truths of antiquity, if I had
re∣turned without seeing the <HI>Grotte d' Antiparos,</HI> and I took courage
and descended—</P>
<P>We supped very agreeably on board the Tarleton, and looked over
the pieces we had brought out of the Grotto; but they were so brittle, they
almost mouldered away at the touch; I put some into a box with cotton. As
we sailed for this place we passed the islands of Siphanto, Milos,
Argentiera, St. George of Arbora—and arrived happily in the Piraean port,
in which remain the two pedestals of the lions which are now at the door of
the Arsenal at Venice—</P>
<P>There is nothing left in these islands worth the stopping to
look at, and they all appear like naked rocks from the sea, of a volcanic
nature—several have disappeared, and others have been so shaken
by earth∣quakes that they are uninhabited—I made a little drawing of one,
which will give you a perfect idea of them all—</P>
<P><PB N="332" REF="341"/> From the Piraean port to Athens the ground
rises gradually—and the only fine things which are seen are, to the
left near the sea, a large grove or wood of olive trees; and just below the
town, standing unincumbered with other objects, the superb, the beautiful
temple of Theseus; the architecture simple and grand; pro∣portioned with
majesty and grace; it has stood to this day an eternal monument of the good
taste of the ancients. But I now finish this letter, for upon paper as upon
land, there is no such thing as tearing me away from this charming building;
so I shall defer some account of it with other things to another
sheet—</P>

<HEAD>LETTER LV.</HEAD>
<P>THE Temple of Minerva, in the citadel of Athens, was used by the
Turks as a ma∣gazine for powder, which blowing up has flung down such a
quantity of beautiful sculpture that I should be very happy to have
permission to pick up the broken pieces on the ground—but, alas, Sir,
I cannot even have a little finger or a toe, for the Ambassador who had
been a whole year negociating for permission to convey to Constantinople
a fragment he had pitched upon, and thought himself sure of, will be
sadly disappointed. The sailors were pre∣pared with cranes, and every
thing neces∣sary to convey this beautiful relick on board the Tarleton;
when after the governor of the citadel, a Turk, had received us with great
politeness, he took Mr. de Truguet <PB N="334" REF="343"/> aside, and told
him, unless he chose to endanger his life, he must give up the thoughts
of touching any thing—That there was an intrigue in the Seraglio to
displace him, and that if any thing was removed, that plea would be
sufficient for his enemies to get his head struck off—Chagrined and
disappointed as Mr. de Truguet was, he could not with any huma∣nity press
the performance of the promise; and we returned to the Consul's, very much
concerned at the excessive injustice and ignorance of the Turks, who have
really not the smallest idea of the value of the treasures they
possess, and destroy them wantonly on every occasion; for, from one
of the pillars of the temple of Theseus, they have sliced a piece of
marble, to burn into lime for the construction of a Turkish fountain; and
such is the fate of many a <HI>chef d'oeuvre</HI> of the best Grecian
sculp∣tors—</P>
<P>The citadel is in an extremely elevated situation, and if
<HI>wisdom</HI> was the virtue the Athenians prized most, the temple could 
<PB N="335" REF="344"/> not be better placed, for the Goddess to direct and
overlook their actions—The Go∣vernor's daughters received me, and the
Consul's wife, and a relation of theirs was brought in who was a melancholy
prey to some inward disease, that was wasting a fine form and features
to decay. I was applied to, and pressed to give a receipt to cure her; and,
when our visit was ended, the Governor and his sons were as impor∣tunate as
the women had been; so I ad∣vised cream of tartar whey, being sure it
could not hurt her. I am sure you laugh if you think there is any thing in my
coun∣tenance that may lead people to take me for a physician—but the
fact is, that the Turks ask every stranger for preseriptions—I will
give you no account of our interview with the Turkish women—dress,
manners, reception is the same every where, the clothes and jewels more or
less magni∣ficent according to the quality of the hus∣band—</P>
<P>In many authors you will find an account of the Temple of Minerva;
of a sweet little <PB N="336" REF="345"/> temple called the Lanthorn of
Diogenes, which is in good preservation; and of the Temple of the Winds
likewise, the interior of which is not at all damaged, but the outside is
half sunken in the ruins of Athens, which has often been ruined, and many
things bearing the stamp of the artist, are, like the artist, buried in
the earth—From my bed-chamber window I look down upon the ruins of a
beautiful gateway, the half of whose pillars are only to be seen, on the
superior part much damaged, and, three large storks nests, with the old
and young—their filth and habitation finishing the me∣lancholy shade,
which the rust of time and the abominable ignorance of the Turks have cast
over them—</P>
<P>The few remaining pillars of the Temple of Jupiter Olympus, or
rather supposed to be that which contained the statues of all the Gods,
give one a very good idea of the incredible size of that temple. A hermit,
not thinking the earth mortifying enough, had perched himself upon the top of
one of these pillars, and never descended for above <PB N="337" REF="346"/>
twenty years; he is long since dead, but his habitation was quite large
enough for one man. Nothing can exceed the magnitude of these enormous
columns; all fluted of the Corinthian order. I think there were two very
natural reasons why our astonish∣ment at these stupendous works
should cease—The first is, in ancient days, slaves or helotes
were by hundreds or thousands to be fed, the masters of them, it is
reason∣able to suppose, would keep them employed; the second is, the
climate and soil were un∣fit for gardens, marble of the purest and
whitest kind was not only found at Paros, but close to Athens—May we
not ima∣gine that this was dug out and worked up, under the direction of the
Athenian archi∣tects and sculptors, by these slaves; the ornamental part,
and perhaps only the finishing strokes of that, was only done by the hand
of a master, in either sculpture or architecture. We produce effects for
the pencil by the trees we plant in our parks or gardens; the Athenians could
neither form landscape or shade by these—but they brought to
perfection an art which gave <PB N="338" REF="347"/> them seats and walks,
secured from the scorching rays of the sun, by their marble edifices,
which were both useful and orna∣mental—A little orange-garden, not
twenty feet square, is shown at Athens, as a more delicious thing in
these days than a new temple, a pillar consecrated, or a prize gained in
the Olympic games. We make a lawn, or plant a clump—they raised an
edifice. The variety of these, and the number of pillars, destined only to
comme∣morate the most trifling events, prove that it was the natural produce
of the soil; and the impossibility of their ingenuity being employed in
any thing but that which caused architecture and sculpture to be brought to
that exquisite perfection in which we find it to this hour—</P>
<P>A book written by Guilletere, which you probably have, gives a very
good account of the port; but the lion and many things he saw do not exist
at present—and the Ilyssus, that river on whose banks so many
philosophers and heroes have walked in <PB N="339" REF="348"/> times of peace,
when the one encouraged, and the other protected, the arts and scien∣ces, is
now no more—it has been drained to water the gardens of Athens by many
cuts, which with the bed of the river are scarcely now to be
traced—</P>
<P>It was Pericles that built the Temple of Minerva; in the Citadel, on
the principal entrance, the basso-relievos are executed in the most
masterly manner; there is a female figure holding the reins to drive two
fiery steeds, which seem to snort and prance in marble—</P>
<P>As to the basso-relievos of the Temple of Theseus, the few
that remain are muti∣lated, and represent the combats between Theseus and
the Amazons—Part of the Theatre remains—and every object that I
saw made me grieve most truly that I could not restore things to their
primitive state of perfection—As to the many recesses and arches
over one another, that seem to be∣long to the Theatre, it is impossible
to ascer∣tain the use that was made of them; nor <PB N="340" REF="349"/> do
I think it a search worthy of our times. But it would be worthy the Emperor's
situ∣ation to take advantage of the desire the Porte has to oblige him, in
order to collect the fragments of the sculpture of the Temple of Minerva, to
preserve them as examples to this or rising generations, and as models for
the ingenious workman to study from—I am called away to see the
Baths—</P>

<P>THE Baths here are very well contrived to stew the rheumatism
out of a person's constitution—but how the women can sup∣port the
heat of them is perfectly incon∣ceivable—The Consul's wife, Madame
Gaspari, and I went into a room which precedes the Bath, which room is the
place where the women dress and undress, sitting like tailors upon
boards—there were above fifty; some having their hair washed, others
dyed, or plaited; some were at the last part of their toilet, putting with
a fine gold pin the black dye into their eyelids; in short, I saw here
Turkish and Greek nature, through every degree of concealment, in her
primitive state—for the women sitting in the inner room were
absolutely so many Eves—and as they came out their flesh 
<PB N="342" REF="351"/> looked boiled—These Baths are the great
amusement of the women, they stay gene∣rally five hours in them; that is in
the water and at their toilet together—but I think I never saw so
many fat women at once together, nor fat ones so fat as these. There is
much art and coquetry in the ar∣rangement of their dress—the shift
parti∣cularly, which closes by hooks behind be∣tween the shoulders; after
it is fastened round the waist, there is a species of stay or corset,
that I had no idea of, but which to whom melted down as these were, was
perfectly necessary. We had very pressing solicitations to undress
and bathe, but such a disgusting sight as this would have put me in an
ill humour with my sex in a bath for ages. Few of these women had fair
skins or fine forms—hardly any—and Madame Gaspari tells me,
that the encomiums and flattery a fine young woman would meet with in these
baths, would be astonishing—I stood some time in the door-way
between the dressing-room and the Bath, which last was circular, with
niches in it for the bathers to sit in; it was a very fine room with a 
<PB N="343" REF="352"/> stone dome—and the light came through small
windows at the top—</P>
<P>In the evening, the Athenian girls were invited to perform before me
the ancient dance called Ariadne's dance. A more stu∣pid performance as a
dance I never saw; but I can conceive that the pantomime of it represents
the despair of Ariadne, when she saw herself forsaken. A woman, that
is to say she who is the most esteemed dan∣cer, gets up, and with a
handkerchief in one hand, waves it about in a languid man∣ner; with the other
she holds the hand of a second, who leads a third, and so on; they move
in a string, ten, twelve, six, eight, the number is indifferent, and this
female line moves in a circle, or according to the direction it shall
please the girl with the handkerchief to give; her eyes are fixed on the
ground, and her step is a sort of swim or sink; the music is as dull
and uniform as her steps, which like her eyes, never lose the
ground—</P>
<P>A sweet little Greek, a girl of five years old, the adopted child
of Madame Rogne, <PB N="344" REF="353"/> the French Consul's sister,
joined in this dance, and then came and sat in my lap, and went to sleep in
my arms; she was something like my Keppel, and her little caresses gave
me more pleasure than all the languid figures of the dancers before my eyes.
To-morrow I set out again upon these seas, where at this hour Turkish
ig∣norance presents different scenes to those that existed, when the
Athenians gave en∣couragement to heroes and sages—

<P>THIS place seems much more alive than any I have been at yet; a
great number of commercial people, and many good houses, with a constant
variety of vessels arriving and departing, make the lazy Turk pass
unnoticed. The French Consul has a young wife, very lively and civil. There
is lying at anchor here the Minerva, a beautiful French ship of
seventy-five guns, com∣manded by the Chevalier de Lygondes, a Knight of
Malta, an elderly and polite man, who happens to be a near relation of Lord
Huntingdon, and we were not a little pleased to talk of him, and claim a
relati∣onship with a person which any one might be honoured to call friend
or parent. He had five-and-twenty young French officers with him, when I saw
him first—and a most <PB N="347" REF="356"/> ridiculous circumstance
happened. I was sitting by Mr. de Lygondes and talking to him; the other
Frenchmen were laughing with the Consul's wife, when a little man came into
the room and addressed himself to me, but so low that I could not
distin∣guish what he said, and took him to be some interpreter (of
which I believe I had seen a dozen in the morning) who complimented me upon
my arrival; but he seeing that I mistook the purport of his speech,
raised his voice, and in good English said, My lady, hearing that you
were here, I would not depart without offering you any servi∣ces in my power;
I answered I was much obliged to him; he made his bow, and went out again;
upon which the giddy part of the company laughed very much, none of them
knowing either the person or the language. I sent after him, and found out
that it was the worthy Mr. Howard, who has sacrificed so much of his time
to the most humane purpose; I begged he might be informed I returned to
Constanti∣nople and from thence to Vienna, and if I could be of the least
use to him in his return, <PB N="348" REF="357"/> I begged he would command
me; but he sent me word his route lay to Venice, meaning to visit all the
lazarettos and pri∣sons on the coasts.</P>
<P>There are no remains of antiquity here, but a spring called
Homer's Fountain; a broken pillar on the ground, by a clear rill, seems to
indicate that a temple may have been dedicated to this source, which
proba∣bly bore the name of a Deity—</P>
<P>I spare you an account of my voyage hither from Athens, a violent
squall of wind forced us to lie two days in the Port Gabrio, where I amused
myself with going on shore, and up to a convent of Greek Monks. The Isle
of Andros and this port, is well marked in the Grecian annals, by the
extraordinary summons Alcibiades gave the inhabitants, and the very ingenious
excuse they made, in order to obviate complying with his demands.</P>
<P>The only pretty shrub to be found on the islands is the
rose-laurel, which is now <PB N="349" REF="358"/> covered with the flower, but
the Greeks imagine it diffuses a noxious vapour, and avoid touching or going
near it. I found out one thing which may be of use to sol∣diers or
sailors. We had endeavoured in vain to get fruit or garden-stuff; a
prodi∣gious quantity of large thistles was the only thing that presented
itself: I desired the largest heads might be picked, and had them boiled,
which, without being partial, I can assure you, were infinitely better than
artichokes; but they must be dressed im∣mediately, for if they are kept
till the next day they become so hard that twelve hours boiling will not make
them tender.</P>
<P>The Chevalier de Lygondes gave me a very fine dinner on board the
Minerva. I shall set out again the day after to-morrow to take up Mr. de
Choiseul at Bursa; and hope I shall meet with no more storms, for I am
sick and tired when violently tossed about—</P>

<P>I Arrived at Bursa just three weeks after I left the port of
Moudagna, and found the Ambassador rather better than I left him. The
situation of Bursa is very beautiful, in a valley between two hills, and is
now a very considerable town. The waters are boiling hot; almost every
house has a circu∣lar bath under it, that adds to the heat of the climate, I
found it intolerable, and Mons. de Choiseul set out a day or two sooner
than he intended, because the inconveniencies of the house were too great;
he laughed very much at my saying <HI>Bon dieu, nous sommes tous ici au
Bain.</HI> To my great surprise, I found there — who intends to
travel by land into Egypt—he set out at twelve <PB N="352" REF="361"/>
o'clock at night—a few hours after my ar∣rival —</P>
<P>I had a very pleasant passage from Smyr∣na to Moudagna. Just
as the Tarleton ar∣rived at the entrance of the Straits the wind dropped
entirely, and we found ourselves in the midst of a large fleet, composed
of vessels of every size and nation, that waited for a south wind to
pass the Dardanels—luckily we did not lie a considerable time at
anchor, a southerly breeze sprung up, and our swift Tarleton left all the
other sails, <HI>lost soon to our sight,</HI> far behind us; nothing
could be more pretty and lively than the scene; and I told Mr. de Choiseul
no fri∣gate in the English or French service could be a better
messenger than this, which I shall ever be obliged to him for having
sent with me. You may think it somewhat strange that the Mount Olympus,
which rises above the town of Bursa, is constantly <PB N="353" REF="362"/>
covered with snow, but so it is. This is not the famed Olympus of the
Heathen Gods, but named after it, probably by a colony, which settled there,
originally from the other Olympus. It is very common to find several places
called by one name in all this part of the world, and to this hour you know, my
dear Sir, the names of France, Scotland, and England, are given by settlers
in newly acquired coun∣tries—</P>
<P>We did not stop at Pera, but came to the Ambassador's house
upon the Canal in his boat, leaving the Tarleton at anchor where she is
constantly placed. This is the only cool house I believe in the environs of
Constantinople. The sea beats against the foundation constantly, and
from my windows I see the entrance of the Canal by the Black Sea, in which,
between ten and eleven, a north wind constantly rises, blowing pretty
fresh till the evening. And it is a very strange thing to aver, but just
over against the house, vessels are sailing, <PB N="354" REF="363"/>
some with a south and others with a north wind; a circumstance only to be
account∣ed for by the shores, which form a kind of horizontal funnel, drawing
in a large body of air from the Black Sea, which loses its force after it has
gone a certain length, and ceases intirely just opposite this house. It
is quite diverting to see the Turkish fishing boats sailing very
fast, and endeavouring to weather this spot when the wind is south∣erly,
but in vain; they are obliged to lower their canvass and tug at the oar, or
anchor in some valley, till the wind or their strength permit them to
proceed—</P>
<P>If any thing could excuse the infatuation of the Greeks to remain
here at the risque of their lives, this situation would plead for them; but
still their manner of life must be a torment even in Paradise itself;
there is one who, fearing the Porte should think him opulent, yet too proud
to appear in public without his attendants, rides round his court-yard every
morning with twenty horsemen at his heels—</P>
<P><PB N="355" REF="364"/> Another sent me word he begged I would not
walk in his garden, for as I generally was accompanied by some of the foreign
ministers, the Porte might imagine he was carrying on some treason
against the empire, if strangers were seen within his enclosures. This
message was told me by a person who added that, all the time I was in his
kitch∣en garden with my company, this wretched Greek had retired into the
most remote clo∣set in his house, fearing our curiosity should prompt
us to look at the build∣ing—</P>
<P>This Greek Prince had hired a French gardener, and we seeing an
European gar∣den close to the Ambassador's, it induced us to walk into
it, as the door was open. When the Turks or Greeks have one, they walk into it,
and eat their sal∣lads there. Fruit and vegetables are luxuries unknown in
general to them—</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Have been to see the forest of Belgrade, where the oaks are
extremely venerable, and, from a superstitious idea, not one of them is
ever felled, so that the greatest part of them are spoiling. The Dutch
Ambas∣sador has a house there, and the English Minister, both of whom
I have promised to dine with. At the latter end of the sum∣mer these
country-houses are deserted, for there is a lake in the forest that
produces such unwholesome exhalations that, if peo∣ple stay in the
neighbourhood of it, they generally have dreadful fevers. There is a kiosk of
the Sultan's at the end of the lake, which would be pretty enough with a little
alteration—</P>
<P><PB N="357" REF="366"/> We are now at the beginning of what is called
the Ramazan—the fast of the Turks, which they observe with great
strictness; from sun-rise to sun-set no Turk tastes any thing,
not even a drop of water; but at night all the shops for eatables, and the
places where coffee is sold, are illuminated with many little lamps; and it
is a pretty sight to go in a boat at sunset along the Ca∣nal. Terrapia,
Buyekdere, and all the places where several people live, look like so many
Vauxhalls; and if the boat draws near enough to the shore, one is apt to
imagine all the world is supping together, the smell of fried fish, and
mutton, and other Turkish eatables is so strong. The Ambassador's
first oar is an old venerable Turk with a long white beard, who has rowed
<HI>au Palais de France</HI> forty years, and it is with great difficulty Mr.
de Choiseul's strictest orders can keep him from his duty—though it
is horrible to think that if he were permitted to attend the boat, he would row
several hours in the day, in the heat of the sun, without taking a drop of
water to refresh himself; for whether a Turk <PB N="358" REF="367"/> be
obliged to the hardest labour, or whether he do nothing, the law of the
Ramazan is equally observed by him—This fast lasts six
weeks—</P>
<P>With respect to coffee, which you may imagine is good in Turkey, I
assure you, prepared by the Turks, it is the nastiest potion ever
invented—They make it weak and muddy, and drink it without sugar. As to
the Moka coffee, not enough of that comes into Constantinople to supply the
Seraglio, and all the rest is furnished by France from her West-Indian
possessions, no inconsiderable branch of commerce as you may easily
believe, when I tell you that every fifty yards upon a public road, under the
shade of a tree or a tent, coffee is sold, and at most of these places
the Turkish traveller or visitor stops and takes a cup—it is true
these cups are not much bigger than egg cups—but four-and-twenty in a
day to each person travelling, visiting, or staying at home, must
consume an im∣mense quantity—</P>
<P><PB N="359" REF="368"/> Mr. de Bukalow has given me a very fine ball
at his house at Buyekdere—and I assure you his garden is large
enough to be a small park. There I saw a tree the leaves of which are of
the same shape and quality with the sensitive plant—they shrink
and close when touched. Mr. d'Herbert has a pretty house and garden at
Buyekdere like∣wise—</P>
<P>Have you never heard at Paris of one Isaac Bey, a Turk, that was
much there? Mr. de Choiseul brought him to me the other morning; he entered
my room fol∣lowed by this Isaac, a lively, and rather well-looking man, who,
after being seated a few minutes, prostrated himself at my feet,
kissed the hem of my garment, and laid a fine embroidered muslin
handkerchief there for my acceptance. He has been at Petersburgh, and in
London, which he dis∣likes of all places in the world, because the common
people would not let him walk along the streets without calling him,
<HI>French dog of a Turk.</HI> He says he will ne∣ver go there again; but
<HI>Paris Paradis—</HI> <PB N="360" REF="369"/> <HI>Paradis

was in agitation two days ago, in presence of the same tall gloomy figure
that promised me the plague in Greece, who gravely told me I should run
much greater risques in taking this new route, for that I should find heads
stuck up on poles at every mile, those countries being much more infested
with robbers and murderers <PB N="362" REF="371"/> than the other. I would not
for the world have given him the mortification to see that I did not believe
a word he said, and I hope he thinks I was extremely terrified. —</P>
<P>Nothing is more diverting than to see the Greeks in
pleasure-boats here, stopping to hear the Ambassador's musicians
play, which they do every evening. I must first tell you that they are
Germans, sent to Mr. de Choiseul from Vienna, and the best per∣formers I
have heard, playing always the finest Italian or German music. The Greeks,
in their parties upon the water, have generally a lyre, a fiddle, and a guittar
or two in the boats. With these instruments they make a horrid noise,
each performer playing in a different key, and if they sing, all in
discordant tones; the sound of the clarinets stops them before the
windows, but after listening a little time, they shake 
<PB N="363" REF="372"/> their heads, and with one accord begin their abominable
noises again, and row away from sounds which they think much inferior to
those they produce. The servants often ask them if their master's
music is not fine, but they are all of opinion it is very disa∣greeable.
This puzzles all my ideas con∣cerning harmony; because nature has fixed the
rules of it so well that any person, pos∣sessing a good ear for
music, will compose in all the perfection of harmony without knowing the
rules of composition, or even a note of music. Why then do not these
Greeks find out they make nothing but dis∣cordant sounds when they sing
or play?—I confess it seems to me a very strange thing.</P>
<P>I wish the Turkish salute was in fashion instead of the
ridiculous bow and curtesey we have which indicates nothing, and is seldom
executed gracefully. A Turk puts his right-hand upon his heart, and bends
forward a little—and I assure you if this kind of salutation is
accompanied with a smile or a respectful look, it conveys to me 
<PB N="364" REF="373"/> more <HI>greeting</HI> than all our <HI>bonjours</HI>
and <HI>how d'ye do's,</HI> which would be often excused with pleasure by
me from half my acquaint∣ance.</P>
<P>I am not sorry to think the time is not far off when I shall
draw nearer to Franconia; where I hope to see you; where I shall tell you
many particulars which I do not choose to trust to the post. But I
confess I shall be very sorry to leave Mr. de Choiseul with∣out being
certain when I can have an op∣portunity of shewing him the least return for
the civilities and kindnesses he has be∣stowed upon me. He is a very
extraordi∣nary and superior man as to his talents—and his amiability is
not contrasted by that conceit which we have too often seen in all
Frenchmen that are not almost superannu∣ated—</P>
<P>I only wish he was honoured by your ac∣quaintance, as you would
like him for his good qualities, as much as you will esteem him without
knowing him for his brotherly and respectful care of me. Can I give you 
<PB N="365" REF="374"/> a greater proof that I believe in the sinceri∣ty of
your friendship to me, than by wish∣ing you to be a friend to one that has
beha∣ved like one to me—I remain always the same—</P>

<HEAD>LETTER LXI.</HEAD>
<P>MR. de Choiseul and the Imperial Mi∣nister assured me very
seriously that they would not let me set out without being ac∣companied
by a Visir's Tchouadar, that is to say, a kind of upper servant, or
rather creature of the Visir. They applied for one, but as these are never
employed to accom∣pany travellers, and have only upon occasi∣on been sent
with the French officers of artillery, when there was a battery or fort to be
erected—the <HI>Sublime Porte</HI> was ex∣ceedingly surprised at this
request—and was five days in looking over papers to find any example of
a Tchouadar being sent to es∣cort a traveller; none being found, my two
friends were told that in the annals of the empire the thing was unprecedented;
but they answered they cared little for that, but requested that I might
have a Tchouadar. <PB N="367" REF="376"/> The Visir was so much
surprised at this that, when he had named one, he sent him to Terrapia to
judge if <HI>I was worth</HI> all the trouble given him upon my
account—</P>
<P>You think, my dear Sir, that it was my birth, or consequence of
any sort that was to be enquired into—not at all—he was to look
at me and see if I was pretty. I was sent for by Mr. de Choiseul into the
draw∣ing-room yesterday before dinner; and when I came in, I saw a yellow
looking Turk sitting on the sofa. Mr. de Choiseul told me that was the
Tchouadar named to accompany me. I curtsied to him, and, after he had looked
at me as much as he pleased, he took his leave. Mr. d'Herbert has since
told me laughing, he made so fa∣vourable a report of me, that the Visir
said according to accounts he could not do enough for me. I have hired two
Greek boats with Greek sailors, that are to row when the wind is contrary,
and I am to land at a Turkish town called Varna, which is upon the shore of
the Black Sea called Romelia. I am there to take horses and go 
<PB N="368" REF="377"/> across Bulgaria to a town called Silistria, where I
shall find all the accommodations I want from the Prince of Wallachia,
whose territories reach that town.</P>
<P>It is said Varna was the place where Ovid was sent into
banishment; it might be so; but the chief of his exile was passed in
Moldavia; the borders of a lake where he often walked, have become famous; the
gentleness of his manners, and the sweet tone of his voice have been
recorded from father to son, down to the present inhabi∣tants of that part
of Moldavia—</P>
<P>I have bought a German carriage, and the Ambassador's
<HI>Tapissier</HI> has very cleverly fitted up a little bed in it for me.
Mr. de Choiseul and his friends are very obliging in imagining every thing
that can conduce to the safety or convenience of my journey. I have a
beautiful coloured map of Constan∣tinople and the Canal, executed in a
mas∣terly manner by his steward and engineer, one Khauffer. Mr de
Choiseul has given me likewise a bottle of Essence of Roses—
<PB N="369" REF="378"/> and a Mr. de Brintanneau has presented me with a
beautiful Turkish fan, painted and made at Constantinople for me. I hope
soon, Sir, to give you a good account of myself; you may depend upon it I
shall write wherever I can find an opportunity of sending a letter to
you—</P>
<P>I have an interpreter with me, and am to have a guard of
Janissaries upon the road wherever it will be thought
necessary—Adieu, for the last time, from this beautiful and
sublime situation, which must make all landscapes appear trifling to me
for the future.</P>
<P>Adieu, dear Sir, till an occasion offers for me to repeat my
sincere esteem and grateful affection for you—</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>VARNA, 
<DATE>July 8, 1786.</DATE></DATELINE> 
<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Take the opportunity of my Greek sailors return to write to my
good friends at Con∣stantinople and to you. On Monday last, which was the
third of July, I set out about six o'clock in the evening in Mr. de
Choiseul's boat, accompanied by him and Mr. le Hocq, a very amiable and
sensible man, who is <HI>Secretaire d'Ambassade,</HI> and the good
little Truguet. I took leave of them at the mouth of the Canal, and stepped
into the largest of the two Greek boats I had hired. The wind, blowing
constantly north, makes the navigation of the Rome∣lian coast extremely
tedious. The idleness and fears of my Greek sailors increased the
inconvenience, for instead of turning the <PB N="371" REF="380"/> point of
Kara-buron they lay-to all night, and on the fourth I made but thirty Turkish
leagues. Kara-buron is a rock standing over the bay of that name, where the
Turks are now erecting a fort. Nothing can be more safe or pleasant than
coasting in this manner. The shores of Romelia abound with many delicious
bays and fine harbours, where, upon the appearance of danger from the Black
Sea, vessels may run in and lie at anchor. The Bay of Agatopoly of Miolick
of Vasilico I rested in likewise; and the last day I came
seven∣ty-five miles in six hours, but not without having many quarrels with
my Greek sailors, who would have delayed me more than they really did, if I
had permitted them—I am convinced a traveller might easily reach Varna
from Constantinople in two days; particularly if he has not the honour of
being accompanied by a Tchouadar, who seems to promise me much more delay
and inconvenience than his presence can make repay. As the Greeks and Turks
know his consequence, it is his wants that are at∣tended to, and not mine. I
positively was <PB N="372" REF="381"/> extremely diverted at my first
occasion of finding this out—The day after we had left
Constantinople, we were at anchor in a little bay to breakfast, when upon
asking my valet de chambre where the boiling water was to make my chocolate,
he could not find it, and began to make a great riot for the loss of his
kettle; when the inter∣preter pointed to a flat rock where my Tchouadar was
sitting on a carpet smoak∣ing his pipe and drinking his coffee, very
quietly, made with the water my servants had prepared for me—You must
not sup∣pose he ever asks if I want any thing. If any travellers were to
meet us, they would certainly take him for some <HI>Grand Seigneur,</HI> and
that I am of his suite, by the care taken of him, and the perfect
indifference all, but my two companions and my servants, show for my ease
and convenience. As to me, I now and then have asked him some questions
about the places I saw, to which I get the most laconic answers; however,
I thought it right to point to two most ex∣cellent little English pistols
I wear at my girdle, and assure him they would be well 
<PB N="373" REF="382"/> employed against any offence I met with. And when the
interpreter had done I could not help calling him a stupid disagreeable
Turk, in English, which he took for a com∣pliment, and bowed his head a
little—When I arrived here, he took me to a shabby Greek house, where
a landing-place on the top of a stair-case was the only lodging he said
he could find for six people—but I told him I should send to the
go∣vernor, upon which I was taken to another house, where a long gallery
looking towards the harbour, with rooms adjoining to it, composed a very good
apartment. Here I found my Tchouadar had established his carpet, his pipe,
his coffee, and his tra∣velling bags and pistols. I thanked him in good
English, as I should, for his civility; and then ordered the interpreter to
tell him he might lodge upon the stair-case he had destined for me. The
Governor sent to know if I chose to have a guard of Janissaries for the
house, but I thought myself quite se∣cure, being shut in by two
court-yards—However, in the evening, I was not a little 
<PB N="374" REF="383"/> surprised to hear a great noise; the old Greek,
who lodged me, my interpreter, and servants, came running with great hor∣ror
in their looks, saying, that the Turks had broke the gates of the court open,
and were looking for me—I was, at that mo∣ment, sitting with
Mademoiselle by me, on a trunk just facing the door; I had scarcely time
to understand what was said to me, when I saw above fifty Turkish heads
at the door, with eager eyes looking about for something—<HI>Que
veulent ils done?</HI> said Mademoiselle—<HI>car n'est pas
nous</HI>—I be∣lieve I told you she had a most beautiful little
milk-white rough dog—It was this animal that some Turk had seen
carrying along the streets, which had awakened the curiosity of the Turks;
and two or three parties, as I found afterwards, had endea∣voured to come into
the house to see him. This last, bolder than the rest, had forced the
doors open. The little dog, as great a coward in his nature as my servants
(and that is saying all I can to prove his <HI>poltron∣nerie)</HI> upon the
first noise had taken refuge under the skirts of Mademoiselle's
petti∣coats—But <PB N="375" REF="384"/> one of them, taking her by the
arm, made her get up, the dog appeared; when the Turks, with a savage shout
of joy, all pointed to him; and I had no doubt but he was the object they had
in view—However, when I thought they had stared enough at him, I grew
out of patience, and made a sign for the Turks to leave the door, which they
did immediately; and I think a Turkish rabble very civil, as not one of the
party passed the threshold of the door.—</P>
<P>People imagine this coast to be inhabited by savage Turks, who
live by rapine and plunder, uncontrolled by the Porte; but it is no such
thing; Greeks and Armenians, very inoffensive, live in habitations thinly
scattered—Wine and corn are cultivated, but in no great abundance.
There is a place called Shiumla, eghteen leagues west of Varna, remarkable
for the retreat which eighty thousand Turks made in the last war, when
twelve thousand Russians, un∣der Romanzof, crossed the Danube to
at∣tack them—</P>
<P><PB N="376" REF="385"/> My Greek sailors lived upon nothing but
dried fish during the voyage, and it is very excellent provision, and
better than any preserved fish I ever tasted; I had often seen great
poles stuck up in the Canal, with strings tied across, under these the
fishermen catch the fish, which they clean and stick up on these
strings to dry by the heat of the sun. Nothing can look more dry and
un∣like food than these fish; but I assure you they are extremely good,
having much more flavour than any salted fish I ever eat.—</P>
<P>I shall set out to-morrow morning at three o'clock—I hire
arabats for my servants and baggage—The Governor is to furnish me
with Janissaries and horses; and I hope my good star will lead me
safely through these countries, where I confess, I feel like the Comte de
—'s servant, who in∣treated his master to let him kill only one or
two Turks, at the last post on leaving the Ottoman empire—By the by,
Sir, that servant lived with you; and when I saw him, you had given him
so English a <PB N="377" REF="386"/> <HI>tournure,</HI> that I insisted
on his being an Englishman; but he told me he was your subject. You must
not suppose that I mean to <HI>murder</HI> any one, but I think of all the
two-legged animals I have seen I should re∣gret killing a Turk the least.
Most women would be frightened with the journey I am taking; but I must get
out of this country of Mahomet's now I am in it, and so I shall proceed
chearfully and merrily—If my Tchouadar could but know the pretty things I
say to him in English; and how I mean to watch him, he would not have given
such a picture of me to his master.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER LXIII.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>SILISTRIA, 
<DATE>July 15, 1786.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Am arrived here very safely and merrily notwithstanding my
intriguing Tchouadar, who probably had his orders to frighten me, that I might
complain of the Governor of Varna. Figure to yourself, dear Sir, how much
surprised I was at six o'clock the day before yesterday in the evening,
in the wildest country imaginable, after travelling all day well escorted
by Janissaries, to see them ride away when the approach of even∣ing made
me think them most necessary—I asked my Tchouadar what was the
mean∣ing of their sudden departure? He shrugged up his shoulders, and
said he supposed it was the Governor's orders. However, I rested near a
hedge, where a caravan of merchants halted likewise, that evening, without
seeing any thing that could alarm <PB N="379" REF="388"/> me. When I left
Varna in the morning, my lazy Tchouadar had a whole arabat to himself, where
he would not suffer my ser∣vants to put the smallest parcel—I
order∣ed the interpreter to tell him, if I had known his intention I should
have hired saddle-horses for myself and servants, and guarded his
arabat. Yesterday, in the middle of a plain where the coachmen had halted,
which they do every ten mi∣nutes, I heard a most violent quarrel be∣tween
them, and my interpreter upon ask∣ing what it was occasioned the dispute,
I found one coachman chose to return with three horses to Varna. My vile
Tchouadar sat upon his carpet smoaking his pipe, without attempting to
use his authority, and when I asked him to interfere, he muttered out a few
<HI>Ish Allas</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Ish Alla</HI> is an
expression by which Turks constantly avoid giving a direct answer to a
plain question—it amounts to <HI>it may be so</HI>—or,
<HI>please God</HI>—</NOTE>, and he supposed the Gover∣nor of Varna
had given such orders to the coachmen—Upon which I saw very plain∣ly
my journey was to be a pretext for find∣ing fault with this Governor. I
determined <PB N="380" REF="389"/> immediately upon putting a stop to such a
base manoeuvre; I told my Turk that I perceived his intention, but that if he
did not immediately order the coachman to put the horses to and go as far as
Silistria, I should write an account of the whole trick to the Imperial
Minister and the French Ambassador, and have <HI>him,</HI> not the
Gover∣nor of Varna, punished for the delays of my journey. The very instant
he under∣stood I was not to be imposed upon, he spoke to the drivers, the
horses were put to, and we proceeded.</P>
<P>Bulgaria is but little cultivated, and where I saw a Turk at work
in the fields, he was armed with a gun, pistols, and hang∣ers, sometimes a
Janissary or two guarded the peasant at his work. Such a sight, and a
wood I passed through, so little worn by travellers, that the trees and
bushes tore off the door of my carriage, were circumstances that might have
made any fine lady trem∣ble; but you know, Sir, that my spirits and courage
increase with difficulties, and my female companion is by much the best
tra∣veller <PB N="381" REF="390"/> I ever saw. She expressed no fears if
she had any, and the strange manner in which we travelled, with our manner
of resting at night, made us laugh instead of alarming us. Every ten
minutes, as I told you, our horses were taken from the car∣riage, and with
the coachmen rested under trees, if they were at hand. The heat was beyond
any I ever felt. At night we halted with the caravans, and then my servants
picked up sticks to make the fire for my supper, and after I had
stretched my legs a little, I drew my carriage close, and had a very
comfortable bed; my companions and servants lay on the ground with their
heads under the body of my carriage, and in the morning before day-break, we
set off again. But when day-light permitted us to look at one another, it was
impossible not to laugh, the dew was so excessive that we all looked
as if we had been drawn through a river. When we arrived near this town, I
order∣ed my Tchouadar to get out, and go into the town to find me a
lodging—and here I saw that if his presence had been of any use to
me, his courage would not have served me <PB N="382" REF="391"/> greatly, for
instead of getting upon the horse prepared for him, he gravely turned about
and seated himself in the arabat again. I asked why he did so; he
answered he might be robbed and murdered before he reached the town; which we
were so near to that a whole string of arabats and caravans were halting
there for the night. At last we reached the gateway, and then my
trouble∣some Turk condescended to go and look me out a lodging—a
tolerable good one. Here I had a new contest with him; he intended to
escort me from hence to Buccorest, but I was determined to send him from
this place back to Constantinople. I enquired for the Prince of Wallachia's
agent this morning, he came, but I found I could get no intelligence from him
before my Turk—so I ordered him into another room, and there found he
had received orders from the Prince to furnish me with boats, horses, or
any kind of thing I should ask for. My abominable Tchouadar had
constantly deni∣ed that any such orders were given, in order to persuade
me I could not proceed in my journey without him. However I was 
<PB N="383" REF="392"/> heartily glad I had guessed the truth, and so
returning with my interpreter to him, I gave him the twenty guineas I had
promised him, for the <HI>favour</HI> of his agreeable compa∣ny, and told him
to wait till I had written to the Ministers at Constantinople, which I did,
and now write to you, dear Sir. This town stands in a valley; upon a hill
which we descended to come here, there is a fine view of the Danube with
islands. Silistria is beautifully situated upon this river—and I am
going six miles down in a boat to Kara∣lash, the frontier town of
Wallachia—and from Buccorest I shall again have the honour of
assuring you I am in all places,</P>

<P>WHEN I landed in Wallachia I found horses, provisions, and
guards, provided for me, and I rather flew than drove along. From Karalash,
for a considerable way, the route lay on the borders of the Danube, where
cattle of all sorts were feeding upon the finest sorts of clover,
intermixed with various flowers. There is no road made, and I saw no carriage
track, but a fine soil without stones or ruts, made the journey very
pleasant. As I came near to Bucco∣rest I quitted the meadows, and saw a
most beautiful country, where small woods of fine timber and Turkish
corn, standing above six feet high, formed a rich and varied pic∣ture.
Several boyards came to meet me, and my Arnauts, or guards, were extreme∣ly
alert and clever; though their usual mode of supplying my carriages with
horses often <PB N="386" REF="395"/> gave me great displeasure; for it
frequently happened, that a peasant mounted on a good-looking horse, with
his sack of flour behind him, was dismounted in an instant, a tired
horse left him, and his fresh horse harnessed to my carriage. I
wanted at least to have some money given the man, and an explanation of the
affair, but it seems the Prince of Wallachia had ordered that I should have
no trouble or delay—and not be suffered to pay for any thing, so that
the little money I gave away was privately, and not without much management
could I con∣trive it. Just as I was about to enter Bucco∣rest, I found a
party of Janissaries with a tent pitched about a mile from the town, who
quarrelled with all my attendants, and made the postillions drive back to
enter the town another way as I was told, that road having been shut by order
of the Prince. My sur∣prise increased, when I found myself drove under
a large gateway belonging to a Greek convent, the inner court of which was very
fine and spacious surrounded by cloisters with Gothic arches—My
carriage was pre∣sently surrounded by people of various na∣tions, talking
all languages to me—At last <PB N="387" REF="396"/> I addressed
myself to one in a French dress; pray, Sir, said I, where am I? A German
servant of mine spoke to him in German, and I found I was driven in there
to per∣form quarantine, for five days at least. The superior of the
convent, by this time had come up to the door of the carriage: fancy∣ing by my
looks, I suppose, that I had not the plague, he desired me to make use
of his rooms till I had chosen my lodging for the night. The old venerable
man sat by me and Mademoiselle while we dined; and I had then sent down
to the town to inform the Prince of my situation—But I asked my
respectable host where I should lodge if I staid—He pointed to a
small miserable room across the court, with only bare walls, and the
windows of it were all broken. This room was to contain all my suite with me;
for every company I found that arrived, was kept apart from the rest. Close
to the door of this room I saw a wretched crea∣ture alone, with death in his
countenance. And pray, says I, what is that miserable figure?—A man
suspected to have the plague, who was put away as far from the 
<PB N="388" REF="397"/> others as possible, with a little clean straw to
lie upon. I confess I was heartily glad when the Imperial agent came from the
town, to inform me the Prince was very sorry for the mistake—that it
never was his intention I should be sent to the convent. I thanked my old
father for his civilities, and hastened to the town, where I had been but a
few moments, before a gold coach, made I believe in the year one, came to the
door, with a set of brown-bay stone-horses, that seemed to spurn the
earth. There was a Turkish groom that held the bridle of each horse. A kind
of chamberlain, with a gold robe on, and a long white stick in his hand, and
the Prince's private secretary came to fetch me. The whole town, I believe,
by this time was got round the equipage, and we proceeded very slowly to the
first court of the palace, in which I went through a double row of guards,
some of them Janis∣saries, and the others Arnauts and Albani∣ans. In the
second court was another dou∣ble row of guards, and these extended up a
large flight of steps that conducted us to the great audience-chamber, in the
corner of <PB N="389" REF="398"/> which, a space was divided off with
cushi∣ons, upon which sat the Prince, dressed and attended <HI>à

la Turque;</HI> over his head were ranged the horses tails, the great helmet
and feather, the magnificent sabre, and other arms which I had seen parade
before him in the streets of Constantinople. He asked me by the
interpreter, how Mons. de Choiseul did—and if I would not make some
stay in Wallachia. Coffee and sweetmeats were served, and when I rose
to take my leave, one of his chamberlains told me in a whisper to sit down
again, when my ears were assailed by the most diabolical noise I ever
heard; upon which with a very grave loud voice the secretary said,
<HI>c'est pour vous Madame—c'est la musique du Prince;</HI> and the
Prince desired me to look out into the court—There I saw trumpets of
all kinds, brass plates striking together, and drums of all sizes, some
of which, not larger than breakfast-cups, were ranged on the ground, and the
strikers of them squatted on the ground to beat them. Each musician was
endeavouring to drown the noise of his neigh∣bour, by making a louder if
possible; and <PB N="390" REF="399"/> I do not know that my nerves ever were
so tried before; for my companion, who saw the difficulty I had to refrain
from laughing, was saying, for God's sake do not laugh—</P>
<P>Mr. de Choiseul's excellent German mu∣sicians came into my head
too at that mo∣ment, and the contrast of his music to the noise I heard,
added to the absurdity of the thing, so that I suffered extremely;
how∣ever this scene did not last long, I was called to have an audience of
the Princess—</P>
<P>But here I must leave you for the present. Before I set out I
will finish my account of this reception.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER LXV.</HEAD>
<P>THE Princess was sitting <HI>à la Turque,</HI> with three
of her daughters by her, they were about nine, ten, and eleven years old. The
Princess might be about thirty, a very handsome face, something like the
Duchess of Gordon, only her features and counte∣nance had more softness,
and her skin and hair were fairer. Her person was rather fat, and she was
above six months ad∣vanced in her eighth pregnancy. She took my hand and
seated me by her—The Prince, to shew me an extraordinary degree of
respect, had suffered Mr. V— to come into the Harem, and he sat
down by him. There were near twenty women in the room, one of whom, instead
of a turban, had a high cap of sable put behind her hair, that was combed up
straight over a kind of <PB N="392" REF="401"/> roll—This head-dress
was far from being ugly or unbecoming—The Princess told me it was a
lady of Wallachia, and that the cap was the dress of the country. After the
Princess had asked me all the simple questi∣ons generally asked by
the Eastern females—she asked me if I was dressed in the French
fashion; and told me she should be happy to know any thing she could do
to detain me in Wallachia a whole year—The Prince seemed to desire it
as much as she did—But I assured them I should not stay
four-and-twenty hours in Buccorest. They then de∣sired me to sup with
them, which I consent∣ed to, but desired I might return to my lodgings to
write to Constantinople, as I had promised immediately upon my arrival to
this place. I was conducted back to my coach, and through the courts with the
same ceremony as I came. And being seated, the secretary told me he was
ordered to shew me a fine English garden belonging to an old boyard, which
we went to. A country curate's kitchen-garden in England and that were the
same—But the master of it was a venerable figure with a beard as
white as <PB N="393" REF="402"/> snow, dressed in a long muslin robe,
sup∣ported by his servants, as he walked with difficulty. He presently
ordered all the fruit in his garden to be presented to me; and when I was
going out of the garden, I met the very lady, with her fur cap, I had seen in
the palace. She shewed such trans∣ports of joy upon finding me at her
father's house, that it was with difficulty I could get from her; she had
taken me in her arms, and almost smothered me with kisses—</P>
<P>The respectable father's name is Bano Dedescolo, and one of the
principal noble∣men in Wallachia; however I got to my lodgings at last, and
scarcely had finished a letter to Mr. de Choiseul, when two of the
Prince's people with the secretary came in, followed by many more of his
household. The secretary desired me to go and look over a gallery that
surrounded the back court of the house, I did so; and I saw a beautiful
Arabian horse, in the midst of a great mob; two Turks held his bridle. The
secretary told me the Prince hearing that I <PB N="394" REF="403"/> was fond
of horses desired me to accept that, which a Pacha of three Tails had given
him a few days before; and he hoped I should accept of it with the regard
with which it was presented. I gave him as civil an an∣swer as I could
imagine, and very handsome presents in money to the grooms that brought
him, and to the whole set of stable people. The supper was served in a
more European manner than I should have imagined; a ta∣ble upon legs, and
chairs to sit on were things I did not expect. The Prince sat at the end of
the table, his wife on one side, and I on the other. Mr. V— was
like∣wise invited, and sat at my left. Several women sat down to supper
with us. The Princess had nine females behind her chair to wait upon her;
several silver things, evi∣dently the produce of England, were set upon
the table, such as salt-sellers, cruets, &amp;c. &amp;c. but there were
four candlesticks that seemed to be made of alabaster, set with flowers
composed of small rubies and eme∣ralds, that were very beautiful.
Detestable Turkish music was played during the whole supper, but
relieved now and then by Bo∣hemians, <PB N="395" REF="404"/> whose tunes were
quite delightful, and might have made the heaviest clod of earth desire to
dance. The Prince saw the impression this music made upon me, and
desired they might play oftener than the Turks. It seems these Bohemians
are born slaves, the property of the reigning Prince of Wallachia, while his
power lasts. There are, as he told me, five thousand of them left, formerly
there were five-and-twenty thousand. After the supper was over we sat
some time in the large room the Princess first received me in, but the
Prince and Mr. V— sat on one side, and the Princess, myself, and
the other women on the other. The Princess, I believe, thought I gave
my∣self the liberties of a traveller, when I told her the ladies with us
learned to dance and write—with some other things which she doubted
of, likewise —</P>
<P><PB N="396" REF="405"/> Her husband smoaked his pipe, and I was
sorry she did not too, for I saw that it was her civility to a stranger
that prevented her—The Prince asked me if I knew the Emperor and Prince
Kaunitz? and upon my answering in the affirmative, he asked me—<Q REND="inline">"Should I see them?"—"Probably"—"Why
then (said he) do you tell the Prince I am devoted to his commands—and
tell the Emperor, I hope now we are so near one another, we shall be good
friends."</Q>—The odness of these messages was very near making
me laugh; but I gravely assured him I should deliver them faithfully, if
I had an opportunity—About half past eleven I rose to take my leave,
and received from the Princess some very beautiful embroidered
handkerchiefs, and was obliged again to excuse myself from staying only a
twelvemonth with her, which she said would be a great amusement to her,
as my presence was full of graces. I retired with all the attendants I had
before, only with the addition of I believe a hundred flam∣beaux, and all the
Turkish and Bohemian music playing by the side of the large gold 
<PB N="397" REF="406"/> coach. The horrid disorder and comical procession
got the better of all my gravity; and though the secretary was there, I
laugh∣ed all the way to the French Consul's house, where I now write, the
civil man and wife insisting upon giving me a bed. Mr. V—'s ideas of
good-breeding were so discompesed, by my laughing, that he assured
the secre∣tary the <HI>perfection</HI> of my ear for music was such, that
the least discord in it made me laugh; and he repeated this in all the ways
he could turn it. I said, <HI>oh! out, c'est bien vrai;</HI> but between
whiles I said in English, what would you have me do, I feel like Punch
parading through the streets, with all these trumpets and this mob about
me. However, the secretary and Mr. V— at last caught the infection,
and we arrived laughing all three at the house, where the Consul's wife had
prepared me a comforta∣ble bed, and I got rid of my music by giving them a
handful of money.</P>
<P>It is so hot that I cannot sleep, and I am writing to you, dear
Sir. This is no incon∣siderable town, the situation of it is very 
<PB N="398" REF="407"/> beautiful; indeed in this country it would be difficult
to find an ugly scite; Wallachia pays to the Porte a tribute of four hundred
purses<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A purse is 100 sequins.</NOTE> yearly,
exclusive of grain, wool, and many thousand sheep; shepherds pay an
annual tribute besides, of eighty thou∣sand skins of the cattle, with
butter, cheese, and tallow—</P>
<P>If the grain fails from Egypt, this coun∣try is obliged to supply
the deficiency at Constantinople. Still I affirm that upon earth, Sir, all
things superior in their nature, either animate or inanimate, are taxed
cruelly. This beautiful country, the soil and climate of which makes every
produce luxuriant, is by the hand of fate under a power which extorts
unmercifully from the natives, through the necessities of the Porte, if not
by the rapine of the Princes, and presses plenty from her source, driving
often the wretched Wallaques to fly into the mountains, where, at least for a
time, they avoid the cruelties they find from a tyrannical government, which
punishes <PB N="399" REF="408"/> them for the deficiencies the extortions of
that very government have occasioned.</P>
<P>I set out early to-morrow, and shall write from Hermanstadt,
the first imperial town I shall reach. I have a very clever addition to my
suite here, a kind of trader and interpreter, who speaks the Wallachian
language perfectly, and is going to Her∣manstadt—</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>HERMANSTADT, 
<DATE>July, 18, 1786.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>THE first post from Buccorest is a place called Floresty,
situated eight leagues west of Buccorest. I passed two small
rivers, that unite and increase the current of the river Argis, which river
runs many leagues along the bottom of the Wallachian and Transylvanian
mountains. I was overtaken by the most terrible storm of thunder and rain
that I think I ever saw, and instead of reaching a boyard's house
prepared for me, the first night, I was obliged to halt, and wait patiently
till the elements chose to abate their fury. I was less incommoded than my
fellow-travellers, whose carriages were quite open; and the wind, rain,
thunder, and lightning delayed us the greatest part of the night. When we
could proceed we went on, and rested under the hospita∣ble 
<PB N="401" REF="410"/> roof of a boyard, whose house was beau∣tifully
situated on the river Argis, at the foot of the mountains. Here ended the
flat part of the country, which extends from the Danube, and we began gradually
to ascend. I rested at another boyard's house, and saw, to the right as
I passed, a large Greek monastery, situated on the declivity of a
mountain, surrounded by some well cul∣tivated lands; I shall not attempt
to de∣scribe the majestic beauties of the moun∣tains; timber and shrubs
of all kinds gave them a variety of greens, when we got to the bottom we
followed the course of the river, which ran with rapidity, and its
serpentine meanders were as graceful and sublime as the mountains that
poured forth the stream. Here and there, indeed, the sides of the
moun∣tains were perpendicular, and accidents, or tempests, had thrown down
huge trees that lay across the river, and damming up the water made it fall
in cascades. Nothing more wild or romantic can be conceived, than many places
of this sort by which I passed; but such scenery could scarcely
compensate for the dreadful road. You <PB N="402" REF="411"/> may conceive, my
dear Sir, what a slow progress I made in the mountains, about twenty
peasants on foot held up my carriage, the wheels of which were lifted over
stones as big as the carriage; the night before last, just upon a little
plain, when my guides thought they might venture to let the carriage go, I was
overturned, and as it was for the first time in my life, upon the ground, I
was so much astonished, though not hurt, that I never thought of getting
out, till Mademoiselle D— repeatedly crying out, <HI>Je suis
morte,</HI> raised me out of my stupid surprise; she had received a
blow in the middle of her stomach, but it was only an outward bruise, and
in two hours she felt no inconvenience. This road be∣tween Transylvania and
Wallachia is torn up and destroyed; it was an article in the last peace
concluded between the Emperor and the Porte, I suppose to make the
con∣veyance of heavy artillery impossible. How∣ever convenient this may be
to either power, the inconvenience to travellers must be dreadful. One of the
carriages that fol∣lowed mine was broken into a thousand 
<PB N="403" REF="412"/> pieces, and my new interpreter with one servant came
upon horses, having put the baggage upon others, just in time to see my
carriage set up again; as to theirs it re∣mains in fragments in the place
where it broke to pieces. If any German of your acquaintance, for business
or curiosity, comes into these countries, let him make his journey on
horseback; I assure you, Sir, these beautiful mountains are well worth
seeing; from the foot to the crown of them they bear the richest foliage.
And in Wallachia, where the wood has been cut, and agriculture has been
employed, the finest turf, the finest crops of grain, prove the soil to
be what it is, when you can see it freshly flung up; a rich black mould.
This country may be called indeed a jewel ill set, what would it be under the
hands of taste and industry—</P>
<P>The timber at present is but little em∣ployed, the trouble of
conveying it away from the mountains being excessive; the 
<PB N="404" REF="413"/> river is too shallow, and too much obstructed to
admit of rafts. I slept the night before last, after my overturn, at a
place where there were only two miserable huts; one had a kitchen just big
enough to hold one mat∣tress, which Mademoiselle and I divided. The morning
waked me, and I saw my Arabian grasing close to my window, upon a little
green plain; the two Arnauts that conducted him were fast asleep under his
feet; he was tethered by a rope, and seemed to be much accustomed to have
attendants waiting upon him. A few hours brought me to a custom-house of
the Emperor's, that is upon the frontiers, still at the edge of the river
that I had followed, and at the bottom of those enchanting mountains,
destined certainly for other purposes than harbouring oppressed
subjects or fugitive murderers. I cannot tell you, Sir, how glad I was to
see the eagle upon a post, and feel myself under the Imperial protection,
though I never travelled so well attended, and so courteously treated as
in Wallachia. The ill-administered government of the <PB N="405" REF="414"/>
Porte can never secure travellers per∣fectly from the outrages of rebellious
provinces—</P>
<P>From the custom-house I reached a for∣tress, where an old
grey-headed major re∣ceived me with the greatest respect and attention, and
I walked up above eighty steep stone steps to come to his apartments.
There he gave me a supper, and had some clean comfortable beds prepared for
me and all my suite—This old gentleman told me he had commanded there
three-and-twenty years, and I was the first lady he had seen or heard of
passing that frontier—If some of my friends could have seen the
outside of this fortress, and been told I was there, without knowing
why—they would have thought me shut up for life —</P>
<P><PB N="406" REF="415"/> Five leagues more brought me to this place,
where I am lodged at a Baron de Buccow's, son of the late Governor's, but who
lives now in partnership with a Swiss family, who are worthy good people;
and who seem to me to be as glad to have me rest three days, as I am to
feel myself among Christian like people—</P>
<P>There is a camp of cavalry here, and the Emperor arrived the day
before I did to review the regiments—He sent me a mes∣sage the
instant he knew I was come, to know if I was lodged well, and to ask how I
did, and if I was not accommodated pro∣perly, he should give orders that I
might find a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ments to my
liking—I sent him back word I could not be better situated, and he is
to do me the honour of calling upon me to-morrow morning. He has only General
Brown with him, and he lodges like a private gentleman, at an inn in the town
One of the wheels of my carriage broke, and they were all in so bad a
con∣dition. that I am obliged to stay here four <PB N="407" REF="416"/> days,
to have a new set. I shall write the day after to-morrow, when I quit my

<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Have been extremely well entertained here by the Governor, who is
a sensible old man, and the only governor remaining in the Imperial
service, as I am told, that was so named by the late Empress—He is
a Protestant—He has a well arranged cabinet of specimens from all the
mines of Tran∣sylvania; the gold is very fine, the gold mines are rich, I am
told they pay annu∣ally two hundred and fifty thousand ducats to the Emperor;
this is a tax upon the proprietors of the mines, which is about the rate of a
third of the solid weight of ore extracted—viz. three florins out of
nine—a much more sensible plan than making all the gold or silver
mines in a country the <PB N="409" REF="418"/> property of the sovereign, if
once disco∣vered; the natural consequence of which law is, that the
possessors of the land which contain those precious mines, take great
care they should never be found —</P>
<P>He is very fond of pictures, and has a collection among which a
Charles the First and his wife are extremely fine—and a St. Jerome, by
Guido, with a lion, is in∣valuable—indeed he said he had been of∣fered
four thousand pounds for the last—A noble Hungarian, a Comte de
Vitzay, and his wife, who was an Esterhazy, with some more nobility, dined
with me at the Governor's, and the Comte de Vitzay has taken the charge of my
Arabian to Vienna. I believe I told you in my last that the Emperor had
sent me word he should wait upon me, which he did. He came on foot,
attended only by General Brown, and sat two hours and a half looking over the
maps and presents I have received; the maps seemed to please him very
much; and <PB N="410" REF="419"/> when I delivered to him the Prince of
Wallachia's message he laughed, as I was a very faithful ambassador.
Yesterday mor∣ning I was at the review, but the day was wet, stormy, and
uncomfortable. The Emperor quitted Hermanstadt after the review was over. He
sent General Brown to tell me, he had been so good to order him to write to
the Comte de Soro, that commanded at Temeswar, and to the Comte de Colloredo,
at Peterwaradin, that post-horses might be ready for me, if I chose to go
round by Peterwaradin to see the Croat troops; which I suppose you know
form a kind of militia, that, guarding the frontiers in time of peace,
cultivate the land; and in time of war are the troops most to be depended
upon. The Emperor had given me an account of these troops, and seemed to
wish I should go round to see them; but I confess I long much to reach
Vienna, having letters I am sure which interest me very much, waiting for
me —</P>
<P><PB N="411" REF="420"/> I shall write when I reach Vienna—and
remain with great respect and affection,</P>

<DATE>August 30, 1786</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Am arrived very safely and pleasantly here, and was only
delayed upon the road by the Comte de Soro, who insisted upon my dining
with him. I think Hungary a noble country, and only wants navigations made
across from the Adriatic to the Da∣nube, to be one of the richest and
best peo∣pled countries upon earth. Turkish idle∣ness, which probably
ever will remain the same, gives a fine opportunity for the in∣habitants of
Hungary to become the richest and happiest people in the world—If
fate had made me mistress of that particular spot, I should form a
strict alliance with the Porte, asking nothing but a free trade 
<PB N="413" REF="422"/> upon the Black sea—Can you conceive, Sir, any
thing so comfortable as to have an immense wall or barrier, such
Turkish supineness creates, between my kingdom and an ambitious
neighbour?—How I would encourage Asiatic splendour,
super∣stition, and laziness, and never do any thing that could weaken
such a barrier—Ambition, which often leads men into many wrong paths in
politics, may suggest to the Imperial courts that the Turks should be
confined to their Asiatic shore, and all European Turkey should belong to
the Christians—but I am not of that opinion; and after the sea, I
would not wish to surround my country with any other de∣fence than that
which Mahometan idleness could form—The Turks are faithful to their
treaties, and do not seek war under false pretences—Their revolted
pachas give them too much trouble, constantly, not to make them desire
eternal peace with their foreign neighbours—A gentleman with a foolish
troublesome wife to make his fireside uncomfortable, does not go out 
<PB N="414" REF="423"/> of his house to seek new discontents—Such is
the situation of the Porte—The per∣petual disquietude of the empire
makes the thinking Turk find a comfort in the dull moments of rest he finds
upon his carpet, spread under the lofty plantane—and we must not
wonder to see so many of them seemingly to enjoy moments, which to us
would be death-like stupidity. But as I am not the sovereign of any
country, I will not take up more of your time with my reflections, but tell you
that I found Prince Kaunitz here very glad to see me; he saluted me with
a—<HI>Ah, vous voila ma noble Dame</HI>—I have a great
satisfaction here in seeing the young Countess of C— and her
sister, whom I was acquainted with before; but Lady G— I never had an
opportunity of seeing since her new connection with me—She is gentle,
modest, and amiable, and I find both her and her sister please very
much here—I shall stay only till I receive letters from — and
—, and then set out for Anspach, where I shall have the honour and
most <PB N="415" REF="424"/> sincere pleasure of paying my respects to
you, and assuring you in person how much I am, dear brother,</P>
