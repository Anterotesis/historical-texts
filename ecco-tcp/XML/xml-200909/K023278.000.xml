<HEAD>PREFACE TO THE ENGLISH EDITION.</HEAD>
<P>FROM the part Mr. Burke took in the American Revolution, it was natural that I should consider him a friend to mankind; and as our acquaintance commenced on that ground, it would have been more agreeable to me to have had cause to continue in that opinion, than to change it.</P>
<P>At the time Mr. Burke made his violent speech last winter in the English Parliament against the French Revolution and the Na∣tional Assembly, I was in Paris, and had written him, but a short time before, to in∣form him how prosperously matters were going on. Soon after this, I saw his adver∣tisement of the Pamphlet he intended to pub∣lish: As the attack was to be made in a language but little studied, and less understood, in France, and as every thing suffers by translation, I promised some of the friends of the Revolution in that country, that when∣ever Mr. Burke's Pamphlet came forth, I
<PB N="viii" REF="3"/>
would answer it. This appeared to me the more necessary to be done, when I saw the flagrant misrepresentations which Mr. Burke's Pamphlet contains; and that while it is an outrageous abuse on the French Revolution, and the principles of Liberty, it is an impo∣sition on the rest of the world.</P>
<P>I am the more astonished and disappointed at this conduct in Mr. Burke, as (from the circumstance I am going to mention), I had formed other expectations.</P>
<P>I had seen enough of the miseries of war, to wish it might never more have existence in the world, and that some other mode might be found out to settle the differences that should occa∣sionally arise in the neighbourhood of nations. This certainly might be done if Courts were disposed to set honestly about it, or if coun∣tries were enlightened enough not to be made the dupes of Courts. The people of America had been bred up in the same prejudices against France, which at that time character∣ized the people of England; but experience and an acquaintance with the French Nation have most effectually shown to the Americans the falsehood of those prejudices; and I do not believe that a more cordial and confiden∣tial intercourse exists between any two coun∣tries than between America and France.</P>
<P><PB N="ix" REF="4"/>When I came to France in the Spring of 1787, the Archbishop of Thoulouse was then Minister, and at that time highly esteemed. I became much acquainted with the private Secretary of that Minister, a man of an enlar∣ged benevolent heart; and found, that his sentiments and my own perfectly agreed with respect to the madness of war, and the wretched impolicy of two nations, like Eng∣land and France, continually worrying each other, to no other end than that of a mutual increase of burdens and taxes. That I might be assured I had not misunderstood him, nor he me, I put the substance of our opinions into writing, and sent it to him; subjoining a request, that if I should see among the peo∣ple of England, any disposition to cultivate a better understanding between the two nations than had hitherto prevailed, how far I might be authorized to say that the same disposition prevailed on the part of France? He an∣swered me by letter in the most unreserved manner, and that not for himself only, but for the Minister, with whose knowledge the letter was declared to be written.</P>
<P>I put this letter into the hands of Mr. Burke almost three years ago, and left it with him, where it still remains; hoping, and at the same time naturally expecting, from the opi∣nion
<PB N="x" REF="5"/>
I had conceived of him, that he would find some opportunity of making a good use of it, for the purpose of removing those errors and prejudices, which two neighbouring na∣tions, from the want of knowing each other, had entertained, to the injury of both.</P>
<P>When the French Revolution broke out, it certainly afforded to Mr. Burke an opportu∣nity of doing some good, had he been disposed to it; instead of which, no sooner did he see the old prejudices wearing away, than he immediately began sowing the seeds of a new inveteracy, as if he were afraid that England and France would cease to be enemies. That there are men in all countries who get their living by war, and by keeping up the quar∣rels of Nations, is as shocking as it is true; but when those who are concerned in the go∣vernment of a country, make it their study to sow discord, and cultivate prejudices between Nations, it becomes the more unpardonable.</P>
<P>With respect to a paragraph in this Work alluding to Mr. Burke's having a pension, the report has been some time in circulation, at least two months; and as a person is often the last to hear what concerns him the most to know, I have mentioned it, that Mr. Burke may have an opportunity of contradicting the rumour, if he thinks proper.</P>

<HEAD><HI>RIGHTS OF MAN,</HI> &amp;c. &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>AMONG the incivilities by which nations or individuals provoke and irritate each other, Mr. Burke's pamphlet on the French Revolution is an extraordinary instance. Neither the People of France, nor the National Assembly, were troubling themselves about the affairs of England, or the English Parliament; and why Mr. Burke should commence an unprovoked attack upon them, both in parliament and in public, is a con∣duct that cannot be pardoned on the score of manners, nor justified on that of policy.</P>
<P>There is scarcely an epithet of abuse to be found in the English language, with which Mr. Burke has not loaded the French Nation and the National Assembly. Every thing which rancour, prejudice, ignorance, or knowledge could suggest, are poured forth in the copious fury of near four hundred pages. In the strain and on the plan Mr. Burke was writing, he might have written on to as many thousands. When the tongue or the
<PB N="8" REF="8"/>
pen is let loose in a frenzy of passion, it is the man, and not the subject, that becomes ex∣hausted.</P>
<P>Hitherto Mr. Burke has been mistaken and disappointed in the opinions he had formed of the affairs of France; but such is the ingenuity of his hope, or the malignancy of his despair, that it furnishes him with new pretences to go on. There was a time when it was impossible to make Mr. Burke believe there would be any revolution in France. His opinion then was, that the French had neither spirit to undertake it, nor fortitude to support it; and now that there is one, he seeks an escape, by condemning it.</P>
<P>Not sufficiently content with abusing the Na∣tional Assembly, a great part of his work is taken up with abusing Dr. Price (one of the best-hearted men that lives), and the two societies in England known by the name of the Revolution Society, and the Society for Constitutional Information.</P>
<P>Dr. Price had preached a sermon on the 4th of November 1789, being the anniversary of what is called in England, the Revolution which took place 1688. Mr. Burke, speaking of this sermon, says, <Q>The Political Divine proceeds dogmati∣cally to assert, that, by the principles of the Revolution, the people of England have ac∣quired three fundamental rights:
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. To choose our own governors.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. To cashier them for misconduct.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. To frame a government for ourselves.</ITEM>
</LIST></Q></P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="9"/>Dr. Price does not say that the right to do these things exists in this or in that person, or in this or in that description of persons, but that it exists in the <HI>whole;</HI> that it is a right resident in the nation. —Mr. Burke, on the contrary, denies that such a right exists in the nation, either in whole or in part, or that it exists any where; and, what is still more strange and marvellous, he says, <Q>that the people of England utterly disclaim such a right, and that they will resist the practical assertion of it with their lives and fortunes.</Q> That men should take up arms, and spend their lives and fortunes, <HI>not</HI> to maintain their rights, but to maintain they have <HI>not</HI> rights, is an entire new species of dis∣covery, and suited to the paradoxial genius of Mr. Burke.</P>
<P>The method which Mr. Burke takes to prove that the people of England have no such rights, and that such rights do not now exist in the nation, either in whole or in part, or any where at all, is of the same marvellous and monstrous kind with what he has already said; for his arguments are, that the persons, or the generation of persons, in whom they did exist, are dead, and with them the right is dead also. To prove this, he quotes a declaration made by parliament about a hundred years ago, to William and Mary, in these words: <Q>The Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Com∣mons, do, in the name of the people aforesaid, —(meaning the people of England then living)— most humbly and faithfully <HI>submit</HI> themselves, their <HI>heirs</HI> and <HI>posterities,</HI> for EVER.</Q> He also
<PB N="10" REF="10"/>
quotes a clause of another act of parliament made in the same reign, the terms of which, he says, <Q>binds us—(meaning the people of that day)— our <HI>heirs,</HI> and our <HI>posterity,</HI> to <HI>them,</HI> their <HI>heirs</HI> and <HI>posterity,</HI> to the end of time.</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Burke conceives his point sufficiently esta∣blished by producing those clauses, which he en∣forces by saying that they exclude the right of the nation for <HI>ever:</HI> And not yet content with making such declarations, repeated over and over again, he further says, <Q>that if the people of England possessed such a right before the Revolution, (which he acknowledges to have been the case, not only in England, but throughout Europe, at an early period), yet that the <HI>English nation</HI> did, at the time of the Revolution, most solemnly renounce and abdicate it, for themselves, and for <HI>all their posterity, for ever.</HI></Q></P>
<P>As Mr. Burke occasionally applies the poison drawn from his horrid principles, (if it is not a profanation to call them by the name of princi∣ples), not only to the English nation, but to the French Revolution and the National Assembly, and charges that august, illuminated and illumi∣nating body of men with the epithet of <HI>usurpers,</HI> I shall, <HI>sans ceremonie,</HI> place another system of principles in opposition to his.</P>
<P>The English Parliament of 1688 did a certain thing, which, for themselves and their consti∣tuents, they had a right to do, and which it ap∣peared right should be done: But, in addition to this right, which they possessed by delegation,
<PB N="11" REF="11"/>
<HI>they set up another right by assumption,</HI> that of bind∣ing and controuling posterity to the end of time. The case, therefore, divides itself into two parts; the right which they possessed by delegation, and the right which they set up by assumption. The first is admitted; but, with respect to the second, I reply—</P>
<P>There never did, there never will, and there never can exist a parliament, or any description of men, or any generation of men, in any coun∣try, possessed of the right or the power of binding and controuling posterity to the <HI>"end of time,"</HI> or of commanding for ever how the world shall be governed, or who shall govern it; and there∣fore, all such clauses, acts or declarations, by which the makers of them attempt to do what they have neither the right nor the power to do, nor the power to execute, are in themselves null and void.—Every age and generation must be as free to act for itself, <HI>in all cases,</HI> as the ages and generations which preceded it. The vanity and presumption of governing beyond the grave, is the most ridiculous and insolent of all tyrannies. Man has no property in man; neither has any generation a property in the generations which are to follow. The parliament or the people of 1688, or of any other period, had no more right to dispose of the people of the present day, or to bind or to controul them <HI>in any shape whatever,</HI> than the parliament or the people of the present day have to dispose of, bind or controul those who are to live a hundred or a thousand years hence.
<PB N="12" REF="12"/>
Every generation is, and must be, competent to all the purposes which its occasions require. It is the living, and not the dead, that are to be ac∣commodated. When man ceases to be, his power and his wants cease with him; and having no longer any participation in the concerns of this world, he has no longer any authority in direct∣ing who shall be its governors, or how its govern∣ment shall be organized, or how administered.</P>
<P>I am not contending for nor against any form of government, nor for nor against any party here or elsewhere. That which a whole nation chooses to do, it has a right to do. Mr. Burke says, No. Where then <HI>does</HI> the right exist? I am contend∣ing for the rights of the <HI>living,</HI> and against their being willed away, and controuled and contracted for, by the manuscript assumed authority of the dead; and Mr. Burke is contending for the au∣thority of the dead over the rights and freedom of the living. There was a time when kings disposed of their crowns by will upon their death∣beds, and consigned the people, like beasts of the field, to whatever successor they appointed. This is now so exploded as scarcely to be remem∣bered, and so monstrous as hardly to be believed: But the parliamentary clauses upon which Mr. Burke builds his political church, are of the same nature.</P>
<P>The laws of every country must be analogous to some common principle. In England, no parent or master, nor all the authority of par∣liament, omnipotent as it has called itself, can
<PB N="13" REF="13"/>
bind or controul the personal freedom even of an individual beyond the age of twenty-one years: On what ground of right, then, could the parlia∣ment of 1688, or any other parliament, bind all posterity for ever?</P>
<P>Those who have quitted the world, and those who are not yet arrived at it, are as remote from each other, as the utmost stretch of mortal imagi∣nation can conceive: What possible obligation, then, can exist between them; what rule or prin∣ciple can be laid down, that two non-entities, the one out of existence, and the other not in, and who never can meet in this world, that the one should controul the other to the end of time?</P>
<P>In England, it is said that money cannot be taken out of the pockets of the people without their consent: But who authorized, or who could authorize the parliament of 1688 to controul and take away the freedom of posterity, and limit and confine their right of acting in certain cases for ever, who were not in existence to give or to with∣hold their consent?</P>
<P>A greater absurdity cannot present itself to the understanding of man, than what Mr. Burke offers to his readers. He tells them, and he tells the world to come, that a certain body of men, who existed a hundred years ago, made a law; and that there does not now exist in the nation, nor ever will, nor ever can, a power to alter it. Un∣der how many subtilties, or absurdities, has the divine right to govern been imposed on the cre∣dulity of mankind! Mr. Burke has discovered a
<PB N="14" REF="14"/>
new one, and he has shortened his journey to Rome, by appealing to the power of this infal∣lible parliament of former days; and he produces what it has done, as of divine authority: for that power must certainly be more than human, which no human power to the end of time can alter.</P>
<P>But Mr. Burke has done some service, not to his cause, but to his country, by bringing those clauses into public view. They serve to demon∣strate how necessary it is at all times to watch against the attempted encroachment of power, and to prevent its running to excess. It is some∣what extraordinary, that the offence for which James II. was expelled, that of setting up power by <HI>assumption,</HI> should be re-acted, under another shape and form, by the parliament that expelled him. It shews, that the rights of man were but imperfectly understood at the Revolution; for, certain it is, that the right which that parliament set up by <HI>assumption</HI> (for by delegation it had it not, and could not have it, because none could give it) over the persons and freedom of posterity for ever, was of the same tyrannical unsounded kind which James attempted to set up over the parliament and the nation, and for which he was expelled. The only difference is, (for in principle they dif∣fer not), that the one was an usurper over the living, and the other over the unborn; and as the one has no better authority to stand upon than the other, both of them must be equally null and void, and of no effect.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="15"/>From what, or from whence, does Mr. Burke prove the right of any human power to bind pos∣terity for ever? He has produced his clauses; but he must produce also his proofs, that such a right existed, and shew how it existed. If it ever exist∣ed, it must now exist; for whatever appertains to the nature of man, cannot be annihilated by man. It is the nature of man to die, and he will continue to die as long as he continues to be born. But Mr. Burke has set up a sort of political Adam, in whom all posterity are bound for ever; he must therefore prove that his Adam possessed such a power, or such a right.</P>
<P>The weaker any cord is, the less will it bear to be stretched, and the worse is the policy to stretch it, unless it is intended to break it. Had a person contemplated the overthrow of Mr. Burke's posi∣tions, he would have proceeded as Mr. Burke has done. He would have magnified the authorities, on purpose to have called the <HI>right</HI> of them into question; and the instant the question of right was started, the authorities must have been given up.</P>
<P>It requires but a very small glance of thought to perceive, that altho' laws made in one generation often continue in force through succeeding genera∣tions, yet that they continue to derive their force from the consent of the living. A law not re∣pealed continues in force, not because it <HI>cannot</HI> be repealed, but because it <HI>is not</HI> repealed; and the non-repealing passes for consent.</P>
<P>But Mr. Burke's clauses have not even this quali∣fication in their favour. They become null, by
<PB N="16" REF="16"/>
attempting to become immortal. The nature of them precludes consent. They destroy the right which they <HI>might</HI> have, by grounding it on a right which they <HI>cannot</HI> have. Immortal power is not a human right, and therefore cannot be a right of parliament. The parliament of 1688 might as well have passed an act to have authorized them∣selves to live for ever, as to make their authority live for ever. All therefore that can be said of them is, that they are a formality of words, of as much im∣port, as if those who used them had addressed a con∣gratulation to themselves, and, in the oriental stile of antiquity, had said, O Parliament, live for ever!</P>
<P>The circumstances of the world are continully changing, and the opinions of men change also; and as government is for the living, and not for the dead, it is the living only that has any right in it. That which may be thought right and found convenient in one age, may be thought wrong and found inconvenient in another. In such cases, Who is to decide, the living, or the dead?</P>
<P>As almost one hundred pages of Mr. Burke's book are employed upon these clauses, it will con∣sequently follow, that if the clauses themselves, so far as they set up an <HI>assumed, usurped</HI> dominion over posterity for ever, are unauthoritative, and in their nature null and void; that all his voluminous inferences and declamation drawn therefrom, or founded thereon, are null and void also: and on this ground I rest the matter.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="17"/>We now come more particularly to the affairs of France. Mr. Burke's book has the appear∣ance of being written as instruction to the French nation; but if I may permit myself the use of an extravagant metaphor, suited to the extravagance of the case, It is darkness attempting to illumi∣nate light.</P>
<P>While I am writing this, there are accidentally before me some proposals for a declaration of rights by the Marquis de la Fayette (I ask his pardon for using his former address, and do it only for distinc∣tion's sake) to the National Assembly, on the 11th of July 1789, three days before the taking of the Ba∣stille; and I cannot but be struck by observing how opposite the sources are from which that Gentleman and Mr. Burke draw their principles. Instead of referring to musty records and mouldy parchments to prove that the rights of the living are lost, <Q>re∣nounced and abdicated for ever,</Q> by those who are now no more, as Mr. Burke has done, M. de la Fayette applies to the living world, and empha∣tically says, <Q>Call to mind the sentiments which Nature has engraved in the heart of every citizen, and which take a new force when they are so∣lemnly recognized by all:—For a nation to love liberty, it is sufficient that she knows it; and to be free, it is sufficient that she wills it.</Q> How dry, barren, and obscure, is the source from which Mr. Burke labours! and how ineffectual, though gay with flowers, are all his declamation and his argument, compared with these clear, concise, and soul-animating sentiments! Few and short as they
<PB N="18" REF="18"/>
are, they lead on to a vast field of generous and manly thinking, and do not finish, like Mr. Burke's periods, with music in the ear, and nothing in the heart.</P>
<P>As I have introduced M. de la Fayette, I will take the liberty of adding an anecdote re∣specting his farewel address to the Congress of America in 1783, and which occurred fresh to my mind when I saw Mr. Burke's thundering at∣tack on the French Revolution.—M. de la Fayette went to America at an early period of the war, and continued a volunteer in her service to the end. His conduct through the whole of that enterprise is one of the most extraordinary that is to be found in the history of a young man, scarcely then twenty years of age. Situated in a country that was like the lap of sensual pleasure, and with the means of enjoying it, how few are there to be found who would exchange such a scene for the woods and wildernesses of America, and pass the flowery years of youth in unprofitable danger and hardship! but such is the fact. When the war ended, and he was on the point of taking his final departure, he pre∣sented himself to Congress, and contemplating, in his affectionate farewel, the revolution he had seen, expressed himself in these words: <Q>May this great monument, raised to Liberty, serve as a lesson to the oppressor, and an example to the oppressed!</Q> —When this address came to the hands of Doctor Franklin, who was then in France, he applied to Count Vergennes to have it inserted in the French Gazette, but never could obtain his consent. The
<PB N="19" REF="19"/>
fact was, that Count Vergennes was an aristo∣cratical despot at home, and dreaded the example of the American revolution in France, as certain other persons now dread the example of the French revolution in England; and Mr. Burke's tribute of fear (for in this light his book must be considered) runs parallel with Count Vergennes' refusal. But, to return more particularly to his work—</P>
<P><Q>We have seen (says Mr. Burke) the French rebel against a mild and lawful Monarch, with more fury, outrage, and insult, than any people has been known to rise against the most illegal usurper, or the most sanguinary tyrant.</Q>—This is one among a thousand other instances, in which Mr. Burke shews that he is ignorant of the springs and principles of the French revolution.</P>
<P>It was not against Louis the XVIth, but against the despotic principles of the government, that the nation revolted. These principles had not their origin in him, but in the original establishment, many centuries back; and they were become too deeply rooted to be removed, and the augean stable of parasites and plunderers too abominably filthy to be cleansed, by any thing short of a complete and universal revolution. When it becomes neces∣sary to do a thing, the whole heart and soul should go into the measure, or not attempt it. That crisis was then arrived, and there remained no choice but to act with determined vigour, or not to act at all. The king was known to be the friend of the nation, and this circumstance was favourable to the enter∣prise. Perhaps no man bred up in the stile of an
<PB N="20" REF="20"/>
absolute King, ever possessed a heart so little dispo∣sed to the exercise of that species of power as the present King of France. But the principles of the government itself still remained the same. The Monarch and the Monarchy were distinct and sepa∣rate things; and it was against the established despotism of the latter, and not against the per∣son or principles of the former, that the revolt commenced, and the revolution has been carried.</P>
<P>Mr. Burke does not attend to the distinction between <HI>men</HI> and <HI>principles;</HI> and therefore, he does not see that a revolt may take place against the des∣potism of the latter, while there lies no charge of despotism against the former.</P>
<P>The natural moderation of Louis XVI. contri∣buted nothing to alter the hereditary despotism of the monarchy. All the tyrannies of former reigns, acted under that hereditary despotism, were still liable to be revived in the hands of a suc∣cessor. It was not the respite of a reign that would satisfy France, enlightened as she was then become. A casual discontinuance of the <HI>practice</HI> of despotism, is not a discontinuance of its <HI>princi∣ples;</HI> the former depends on the virtue of the in∣dividual who is in immediate possession of the power; the latter, on the virtue and fortitude of the nation. In the case of Charles I. and James II. of England, the revolt was against the personal despotism of the men; whereas in France, it was against the hereditary despotism of the established government. But men who can consign over the
<PB N="21" REF="21"/>
rights of posterity for ever on the authority of a mouldy parchment, like Mr. Burke, are not qua∣lified to judge of this revolution. It takes in a field too vast for their views to explore, and pro∣ceeds with a mightiness of reason they cannot keep pace with.</P>
<P>But there are many points of view in which this revolution may be considered. When despo∣tism has established itself for ages in a country, as in France, it is not in the person of the King only that it resides. It has the appearance of being so in show, and in nominal authority; but it is not so in practice, and in fact. It has its standard every-where. Every office and department has its despotism, founded upon custom and usage. Every place has its Bastille, and every Bastille its despot. The original hereditary despotism resi∣dent in the person of the King, divides and subdi∣vides itself into a thousand shapes and forms, till at last the whole of it is acted by deputation. This was the case in France; and against this species of despotism, proceeding on through an endless labyrinth of office till the source of it is scarcely perceptible, there is no mode of redress. It strengthens itself by assuming the appearance of duty, and tyrannises under the pretence of obey∣ing.</P>
<P>When a man reflects on the condition which France was in from the nature of her govern∣ment, he will see other causes for revolt than those which immediately connect themselves with the person or character of Louis XVI. There were,
<PB N="22" REF="22"/>
if I may so express it, a thousand despotisms to be reformed in France, which had grown up un∣der the hereditary despotism of the monarchy, and became so rooted as to be in a great measure inde∣pendent of it. Between the monarchy, the par∣liament, and the church, there was a <HI>rivalship</HI> of despotism; besides the feudal despotism operating locally, and the ministerial despotism operating every-where. But Mr. Burke, by considering the King as the only possible object of a revolt, speaks as if France was a village, in which every thing that passed must be known to its commanding officer, and no oppression could be acted but what he could immediately controul. Mr. Burke might have been in the Bastille his whole life, as well under Louis XVI. as Louis XIV. and neither the one nor the other have known that such a man as Mr. Burke existed. The despotic principles of the government were the same in both reigns, though the dispositions of the men were as remote as tyranny and benevolence.</P>
<P>What Mr. Burke considers as a reproach to the French Revolution (that of bringing it for∣ward under a reign more mild than the preced∣ing ones), is one of its highest honours. The revolutions that have taken place in other Euro∣pean countries, have been excited by personal hatred. The rage was against the man, and he became the victim. But, in the instance of France, we see a revolution generated in the rational contemplation of the rights of man, and dis∣tinguishing
<PB N="23" REF="23"/>
from the beginning between persons and principles.</P>
<P>But Mr. Burke appears to have no idea of principles, when he is contemplating governments. <Q>Ten years ago (says he) I could have felicitated France on her having a government, without enquiring what the nature of that government was, or how it was administered.</Q> Is this the language of a rationable man? Is it the language of a heart feeling as it ought to feel for the rights and happiness of the human race? On this ground, Mr. Burke must compliment every go∣vernment in the world, while the victims who suffer under them, whether sold into slavery, or tortured out of existence, are wholly forgotten. It is power, and not principles, that Mr. Burke venerates; and under this abominable depravity, he is disqualified to judge between them.—Thus much for his opinion as to the occasions of the French Revolution. I now proceed to other considerations.</P>
<P>I know a place in America called Point-no-Point; because as you proceed along the shore, gay and flowery as Mr. Burke's language, it con∣tinually recedes and presents itself at a distance before you; but when you have got as far as you can go, there is no point at all. Just thus it is with Mr. Burke's three hundred and fifty-six pages. It is therefore difficult to reply to him. But as the points he wishes to establish, may be inferred from what he abuses, it is in his paradoxes that we must look for his arguments.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="24"/>As to the tragic paintings by which Mr. Burke has outraged his own imagination, and seeks to work upon that of his readers, they are very well calculated for theatrical representation, where facts are manufactured for the sake of show, and accommodated to produce, through the weakness of sympathy, a weeping effect. But Mr. Burke should recollect that he is writing History, and not <HI>Plays;</HI> and that his readers will expect truth, and not the spouting rant of high-toned exclama∣tion.</P>
<P>When we see a man dramatically lamenting in a publication intended to be believed, that, <Q>The age of chivalry is gone! <HI>that</HI> The glory of Europe is ex∣tinguished for ever! <HI>that</HI> The unbought grace of life <HI>(if any one knows what it is),</HI> the cheap defence of nations, the nurse of manly sentiment and heroic enter∣prize, is gone!</Q> and all this because the Quixote age of chivalry nonsense is gone, What opinion can we form of his judgment, or what regard can we pay to his facts? In the rhapsody of his imagination, he has discovered a world of wind-mills, and his sor∣rows are, that there are no Quixotes to attack them. But if the age of aristocracy, like that of chivalry, should fall, and they had originally some connection, Mr. Burke, the trumpeter of the Or∣der, may continue his parody to the end, and finish with exclaiming—<HI>"Othello's occupation's gone!"</HI></P>
<P>Notwithstanding Mr. Burke's horrid paintings, when the French Revolution is compared with that of other countries, the astonishment will be, that it is marked with so few sacrifices; but this
<PB N="25" REF="25"/>
astonishment will cease when we reflect that <HI>principles,</HI> and not <HI>persons,</HI> were the meditated objects of destruction. The mind of the nation was acted upon by a higher stimulus than what the consideration of persons could inspire, and sought a higher conquest than could be produced by the downfal of an enemy. Among the few who fell, there do not appear to be any that were intentionally singled out. They all of them had their fate in the circumstances of the moment, and were not pursued with that long, cold-blooded, unabated revenge which pursued the unfortunate Scotch in the affair of 1745.</P>
<P>Through the whole of Mr. Burke's book I do not observe that the Bastille is mentioned more than once, and that with a kind of implication as if he were sorry it was pulled down, and wished it were built up again. <Q>We have rebuilt New∣gate (says he), and tenanted the mansion; and we have prisons almost as strong as the Bastille for those who dare to libel the Queens of France<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Since writing the above, two other places occur in Mr. Burke's pamphlet, in which the name of the Bastille is mentioned, but in the same manner. In the one, he introduces it in a sort of obscure question, and asks—"Will any ministers who now serve such a king, with but a decent appearance of respect, cordially obey the orders of those whom but the other day, <HI>in his name,</HI> they had committed to the Bastille?" In the other, the taking it is mentioned as implying criminality in the French guards who assisted in demolishing it.— "They have not (says he) forgot the taking the king's castles at Paris."—This is Mr. Burke, who pretends to write on constitu∣tional freedom.</NOTE>.</Q> As to what a madman, like the person called Lord G— G—, might say, and to
<PB N="26" REF="26"/>
whom Newgate is rather a bedlam than a prison, it is unworthy a rational consideration. It was a madman that libelled — and that is sufficient apology; and it afforded an opportunity for con∣fining him, which was the thing that was wished for: But certain it is that Mr. Burke, who does not call himself a madman, whatever other people may do, has libelled, in the most unprovoked man∣ner, and in the grossest stile of the most vulgar abuse, the whole representative authority of France; and yet Mr. Burke takes his seat in the British House of Commons! From his violence and his grief, his silence on some points, and his excess on others, it is difficult not to believe that Mr. Burke is sorry, extremely sorry, that arbitrary power, the power of the Pope, and the Bastille, are pulled down.</P>
<P>Not one glance of compassion, not one commi∣serating reflection, that I can find throughout his book, has he bestowed on those who lingered out the most wretched of lives, a life without hope, in the most miserable of prisons. It is painful to be∣hold a man employing his talents to corrupt him∣self. Nature has been kinder to Mr. Burke than he is to her. He is not affected by the reality of distress touching his heart, but by the showy resemblance of it striking his imagination. He pities the plumage, but forgets the dying bird. Accustomed to kiss the aristocratical hand that hath purloined him from himself, he degenerates into a composition of art, and the genuine soul of nature forsakes him. His hero or his heroine must
<PB N="27" REF="27"/>
be a tragedy-victim expiring in show, and not the real prisoner of misery, sliding into death in the silence of a dungeon.</P>
<P>As Mr. Burke has passed over the whole transac∣tion of the Bastille (and his silence is nothing in his favour), and has entertained his readers with reflec∣tions on supposed facts distorted into real false∣hoods, I will give, since he has not, some account of the circumstances which preceded that transac∣tion. They will serve to shew, that less mischief could scarcely have accompanied such an event, when considered with the treacherous and hostile aggravations of the enemies of the Revolution.</P>
<P>The mind can hardly picture to itself a more tremendous scene than what the city of Paris exhi∣bited at the time of taking the Bastille, and for two days before and after, nor conceive the possibility of its quieting so soon. At a distance, this transac∣tion has appeared only as an act of heroism, stand∣ing on itself; and the close political connection it had with the Revolution is lost in the brilliancy of the atchievement. But we are to consider it as the strength of the parties, brought man to man, and contending for the issue. The Bastille was to be either the prize or the prison of the assailants. The downfal of it included the idea of the down∣fal of Despotism; and this compounded image was become as figuratively united as Bunyan's Doubt∣ing Castle and Giant Despair.</P>
<P>The National Assembly, before and at the time of taking the Bastille, was sitting at Versailles, twelve miles distant from Paris. About a week before the
<PB N="28" REF="28"/>
rising of the Parisians, and their taking the Bastille, it was discovered that a plot was forming, at the head of which was the Count d'Artois, the King's youngest brother, for demolishing the National As∣sembly, seizing its members, and thereby crushing, by a <HI>coup de main,</HI> all hopes and prospects of form∣ing a free government. For the sake of humanity, as well as of freedom, it is well this plan did not succeed. Examples are not wanting to shew how dreadfully vindictive and cruel are all old govern∣ments, when they are successful against what they call a revolt.</P>
<P>This plan must have been some time in con∣templation; because, in order to carry it into exe∣cution, it was necessary to collect a large military force round Paris, and to cut off the communica∣tion between that city and the National Assembly at Versailles. The troops destined for this service were chiefly the foreign troops in the pay of France, and who, for this particular purpose, were drawn from the distant provinces where they were then stationed. When they were collected, to the amount of between twenty-five and thirty thousand, it was judged time to put the plan into execution. The ministry who were then in office, and who were friendly to the Revolution, were instantly dismissed, and a new ministry formed of those who had con∣certed the project;—among whom was Count de Broglio, and to his share was given the command of those troops. The character of this man, as de∣scribed to me in a letter which I communicated to Mr. Burke before he began to write his book, and
<PB N="29" REF="29"/>
from an authority which Mr. Burke well knows was good, was that of <Q>an high-flying aristocrat, cool, and capable of every mischief.</Q></P>
<P>While these matters were agitating, the National Assembly stood in the most perilous and critical situation that a body of men can be supposed to act in. They were the devoted victims, and they knew it. They had the hearts and wishes of their coun∣try on their side, but military authority they had none. The guards of Broglio surrounded the hall where the assembly sat, ready, at the word of com∣mand, to seize their persons, as had been done the year before to the parliament of Paris. Had the National Assembly deserted their trust, or had they exhibited signs of weakness or fear, their enemies had been encouraged, and the country depressed. When the situation they stood in, the cause they were engaged in, and the crisis then ready to burst which should determine their personal and political fate, and that of their country, and probably of Europe, are taken into one view, none but a heart callous with prejudice, or corrupted by dependance, can avoid interesting itself in their success.</P>
<P>The archbishop of Vienne was at this time pre∣sident of the National Assembly; a person too old to undergo the scene that a few days, or a few hours, might bring forth. A man of more ac∣tivity, and bolder fortitude, was necessary; and the National Assembly chose (under the form of a vice-president, for the presidency still resided in the archbishop) M. de la Fayette; and this is the only instance of a vice-president being
<PB N="30" REF="30"/>
chosen. It was at the moment that this storm was pending (July 11.) that a declaration of rights was brought forward by M. de la Fayette, and is the same which is alluded to in page 17. It was hastily drawn up, and makes only a part of a more extensive declaration of rights, agreed upon and adopted afterwards by the National As∣sembly. The particular reason for bringing it forward at this moment, (M. de la Fayette has since informed me) was, that if the National As∣sembly should fall in the threatened destruction that then surrounded it, some traces of its princi∣ples might have the chance of surviving the wreck.</P>
<P>Every thing now was drawing to a crisis. The event was freedom or slavery. On one side, an army of nearly thirty thousand men; on the other, an unarmed body of citizens: for the citizens of Paris, on whom the National Assembly must then immediately depend, were as unarmed and as un∣disciplined as the citizens of London are now.— The French guards had given strong symptoms of their being attached to the national cause; but their numbers were small, not a tenth part of the force that Broglio commanded, and their officers were in the interest of Broglio.</P>
<P>Matters being now ripe for execution, the new ministry made their appearance in office. The reader will carry in his mind, that the Bastille was taken the 14th of July: the point of time I am now speaking to, is the 12th. Immediately on the news of the change of ministry reaching Paris, in the afternoon, all the play-houses and places of
<PB N="31" REF="31"/>
entertainment, shops and houses, were shut up. The change of ministry was considered as the prelude of hostilities, and the opinion was rightly founded.</P>
<P>The foreign troops began to advance towards the city. The Prince de Lambesc, who commanded a body of German cavalry, approached by the Place of Lewis XV. which connects itself with some of the streets. In his march, he insulted and struck an old man with his sword. The French are re∣markable for their respect to old age, and the in∣solence with which it appeared to be done, uniting with the general fermentation they were in, pro∣duced a powerful effect, and a cry of <HI>To arms! to arms!</HI> spread itself in a moment over the city.</P>
<P>Arms they had none, nor scarcely any who knew the use of them: but desperate resolution, when every hope is at stake, supplies, for a while, the want of arms. Near where the Prince de Lam∣besc was drawn up, were large piles of stones collected for building the new bridge, and with these the people attacked the cavalry. A party of the French guards, upon hearing the firing, rushed from their quarters and joined the people; and night coming on, the cavalry retreated.</P>
<P>The streets of Paris, being narrow, are favour∣able for defence; and the loftiness of the houses, consisting of many stories, from which great annoy∣ance might be given, secured them against noctur∣nal enterprises; and the night was spent in provid∣ing themselves with every sort of weapon they could make or procure: Guns, swords, black∣smiths hammers, carpenters axes, iron crows,
<PB N="32" REF="32"/>
pikes, halberts, pitchforks, spits, clubs, &amp;c. &amp;c. The incredible numbers with which they assem∣bled the next morning, and the still more incredible resolution they exhibited, embarrassed and astonished their enemies. Little did the new ministry expect such a salute. Accustomed to slavery themselves, they had no idea that Li∣berty was capable of such inspiration, or that a body of unarmed citizens would dare to face the military force of thirty thousand men. Every moment of this day was employed in collecting arms, concerting plans, and arranging themselves into the best order which such an instantaneous movement could afford. Broglio continued lying round the city, but made no further advances this day, and the succeeding night passed with as much tranquillity as such a scene could possibly produce.</P>
<P>But defence only was not the object of the ci∣tizens. They had a cause at stake, on which de∣pended their freedom or their slavery. They every moment expected an attack, or to hear of one made on the National Assembly; and in such a situation, the most prompt measures are some∣times the best. The object that now presented it∣self was the Bastille; and the eclat of carrying such a fortress in the face of such an army, could not fail to strike a terror into the new ministry, who had scarcely yet had time to meet. By some intercepted correspondence this morning, it was discovered, that the Mayor of Paris, M. Deff∣lesselles, who appeared to be in their interest, was betraying them; and from this discovery, there
<PB N="33" REF="33"/>
remained no doubt that Broglio would reinforce the Bastille the ensuing evening. It was therefore necessary to attack it that day; but before this could be done, it was first necessary to procure a better supply of arms than they were then posses∣ed of.</P>
<P>There was adjoining to the city a large maga∣zine of arms deposited at the Hospital of the In∣valids, which the citizens summoned to surren∣der; and as the place was not defensible, nor attempted much defence, they soon succeeded. Thus supplied, they marched to attack the Bas∣tille; a vast mixed multitude of all ages, and of all degrees, and armed with all sorts of weapons. Imagination would fail in describing to itself the appearance of such a procession, and of the anxie∣ty for the events which a few hours or a few minutes might produce. What plans the mini∣stry was forming, were as unknown to the peo∣ple within the city, as what the citizens were doing was unknown to the ministry; and what move∣ments Broglio might make for the support or relief of the place, were to the citizens equally as un∣known. All was mystery and hazard.</P>
<P>That the Bastille was attacked with an enthusi∣asm of heroism, such only as the highest animation of liberty could inspire, and carried in the space of a few hours, is an event which the world is fully possesed of. I am not undertaking a detail of the attack; but bringing into view the conspi∣racy against the nation which provoked it, and which fell with the Bastille. The prison to which
<PB N="34" REF="34"/>
the new ministry were dooming the National As∣sembly, in addition to its being the high altar and castle of despotism, became the proper object to begin with. This enterprise broke up the new ministry, who began now to fly from the ruin they had prepared for others. The troops of Broglio dispersed, and himself fled also.</P>
<P>Mr. Burke has spoken a great deal about plots, but he has never once spoken of this plot against the National Assembly, and the liberties of the nation; and that he might not, he has passed over all the circumstances that might throw it in his way. The exiles who have fled from France, whose case he so much interests himself in, and from whom he has had his lesson, fled in conse∣quence of the miscarriage of this plot. No plot was formed against them: they were plotting against others; and those who fell, met, not unjustly, the punishment they were preparing to execute. But will Mr. Burke say, that if this plot, contrived with the subtilty of an ambuscade, had succeeded, the successful party would have restrained their wrath so soon? Let the history of all old governments answer the question.</P>
<P>Whom has the National Assembly brought to the scaffold? None. They were themselves the devoted victims of this plot, and they have not re∣taliated; why then are they charged with revenge they have not acted? In the tremendous breaking forth of a whole people, in which all degrees, tempers and characters are confounded, and de∣livering themselves, by a miracle of exertion,
<PB N="35" REF="35"/>
from the destruction meditated against them, is it to be expected that nothing will happen? When men are sore with the sense of oppressions, and menaced with the prospect of new ones, is the calmness of philosophy, or the palsy of insensi∣bility, to be looked for? Mr. Burke exclaims against outrage; yet the greatest is that which himself has committed. His book is a volume of outrage, not apologized for by the impulse of a moment, but cherished through a space of ten months; yet Mr. Burke had no provocation—no life, no interest at stake.</P>
<P>More of the citizens fell in this struggle than of their opponents: but four or five persons were seized by the populace, and instantly put to death; the Governor of the Bastille, and the Mayor of Paris, who was detected in the act of betraying them; and afterwards Foulon, one of the new mi∣nistry, and Berthier his son-in-law, who had accep∣ted the office of Intendant of Paris. Their heads were stuck upon spikes, and carried about the city; and it is upon this mode of punishment that Mr. Burke builds a great part of his tragic scene. Let us therefore examine how men came by the idea of punishing in this manner.</P>
<P>They learn it from the governments they live under, and retaliate the punishments they have been accustomed to behold. The heads stuck upon spikes, which remained for years upon Temple-bar, differed nothing in the horror of the scene from those carried about upon spikes at Paris: yet this was done by the English go∣vernment.
<PB N="34" REF="36"/>

<PB N="35" REF="37"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="36" REF="38"/>
It may perhaps be said, that it signi∣fies nothing to a man what is done to him after he is dead; but it signifies much to the living: it either tortures their feelings, or hardens their hearts; and in either case, it instructs them how to punish when power falls into their hands.</P>
<P>Lay then the axe to the root, and teach govern∣ments humanity. It is their sanguinary punish∣ments which corrupt mankind. In England, the punishment in certain cases, is by <HI>hanging, draw∣ing,</HI> and <HI>quartering;</HI> the heart of the sufferer is cut out, and held up to the view of the populace. In France, under the former goverment, the pu∣nishments were not less barbarous. Who does not remember the execution of Damien, torn to pieces by horses? The effect of those cruel specta∣cles exhibited to the populace, is to destroy ten∣derness, or excite revenge; and by the base and false idea of governing men by terror, instead of reason, they become precedents. It is over the lowest class of mankind that government by terror is intended to operate, and it is on them that it operates to the worst effect. They have sense enough to feel they are the objects aimed at; and they inflict in their turn the examples of terror they have been instructed to practise.</P>
<P>There is in all European countries, a large class of people of that description which in Eng∣land is called the <HI>"mob."</HI> Of this class were those who committed the burnings and devasta∣tions in London in 1780, and of this class were those who carried the heads upon spikes in Paris.
<PB N="37" REF="39"/>
Foulon and Berthier were taken up in the coun∣try, and sent to Paris, to undergo their examina∣tion at the Hotel de Ville; for the National As∣sembly, immediately on the new ministry coming into office, passed a decree, which they commu∣nicated to the King and Cabinet, that they (the National Assembly) would hold the ministry, of which Foulon was one, responsible for the mea∣sures they were advising and pursuing; but the mob, incensed at the appearance of Foulon and Berthier, tore them from their conductors before they were carried to the Hotel de Ville, and exe∣cuted them on the spot. Why then does Mr. Burke charge outrages of this kind on a whole people? As well may he charge the riots and outrages of 1780 on all the people of London, or those in Ireland on all his countrymen.</P>
<P>But every thing we see or hear offensive to our feelings, and derogatory to the human character, should lead to other reflections than those of re∣proach. Even the beings who commit them have some claim to our consideration. How then is it that such vast classes of mankind as are dis∣tinguished by the appellation of the vulgar, or the ignorant mob, are so numerous in all old countries? The instant we ask ourselves this question, reflection feels an answer. They arise, as an unavoidable consequence, out of the ill construction of all old governments in Europe, England included with the rest. It is by distorted∣ly exalting some men, that others are distortedly debased, till the whole is out of nature. A vast
<PB N="38" REF="40"/>
mass of mankind are degradedly thrown into the back-ground of the human picture, to bring for∣ward with greater glare, the puppet-show of state and aristocracy. In the commencement of a Revolution, those men are rather the followers of the <HI>camp</HI> than of the <HI>standard</HI> of liberty, and have yet to be instructed how to reverence it.</P>
<P>I give to Mr. Burke all his theatrical exagge∣rations for facts, and I then ask him, if they do not establish the certainty of what I here lay down? Admitting them to be true, they shew the necessi∣ty of the French Revolution, as much as any one thing he could have asserted. These outrages were not the effect of the principles of the Revolution, but of the degraded mind that existed before the Revolution, and which the Revolution is calculated to reform. Place them then to their proper cause, and take the reproach of them to your own side.</P>
<P>It is to the honour of the National Assembly, and the city of Paris, that during such a tremen∣dous scene of arms and confusion, beyond the controul of all authority, they have been able, by the influence of example and exhortation, to restrain so much. Never were more pains taken to instruct and enlighten mankind, and to make them see that their interest consisted in their virtue, and not in their revenge, than have been displayed in the Revolution of France. I now proceed to make some remarks on Mr. Burke's account of the expedition to Versailles, October the 5th and 6th.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="41"/>I cannot consider Mr. Burke's book in scarcely any other light than a dramatic performance; and he must, I think, have considered it in the same light himself, by the poetical liberties he has taken of omitting some facts, distorting others, and making the whole machinery bend to pro∣duce a stage effect. Of this kind is his account of the expedition to Versailles. He begins this account by omitting the only facts which as causes are known to be true; every thing beyond these is conjecture even in Paris: and he then works up a tale accommodated to his own passions and prejudices.</P>
<P>It is to be observed throughout Mr. Burke's book, that he never speaks of plots <HI>against</HI> the Revolution; and it is from those plots that all the mischiefs have arisen. It suits his purpose to exhibit the consequences without their causes. It is one of the arts of the drama to do so. If the crimes of men were exhibited with their sufferings, stage effect would sometimes be lost, and the audience would be inclined to ap∣prove where it was intended they should commi∣serate.</P>
<P>After all the investigations that have been made into this intricate affair, (the expedition to Ver∣sailles), it still remains enveloped in all that kind of mystery which ever accompanies events produ∣ced more from a concurrence of awkward circum∣stances, than from fixed design. While the cha∣racters of men are forming, as is always the case in revolutions, there is a reciprocal suspicion, and
<PB N="40" REF="42"/>
a disposition to misinterpret each other; and even parties directly opposite in principle, will some∣times concur in pushing forward the same move∣ment with very different views, and with the hopes of its producing very different consequences. A great deal of this may be discovered in this em∣barrassed affair, and yet the issue of the whole was what nobody had in view.</P>
<P>The only things certainly known, are, that con∣siderable uneasiness was at this time excited at Paris, by the delay of the King in not sanctioning and forwarding the decrees of the National Assem∣bly, particularly that of the <HI>Declaration of the Rights of Man,</HI> and the decrees of the <HI>fourth of August,</HI> which contained the foundation principles on which the constitution was to be erected. The kindest, and perhaps the fairest conjecture upon this matter is, that some of the ministers intended to make remarks and observations upon certain parts of them, before they were finally sanctioned and sent to the provinces; but be this as it may, the enemies of the revolution derived hope from the delay, and the friends of the revolution, un∣easiness.</P>
<P>During this state of suspense, the <HI>Garde du Corps,</HI> which was composed, as such regiments generally are, of persons much connected with the Court, gave an entertainment at Versailles (Oct. 1,) to some foreign regiments then arrived; and when the entertainment was at the height, on a signal given, the <HI>Garde du Corps</HI> tore the national cockade from their hats, trampled it under foot, and re∣placed
<PB N="41" REF="43"/>
it with a counter cockade prepared for the purpose. An indignity of this kind amounted to defiance. It was like declaring war; and if men will give challenges, they must expect consequen¦ces. But all this Mr. Burke has carefully kept out of sight. He begins his account by saying, <Q>History will record, that on the morning of the 6th of October 1789, the King and Queen of France, after a day of confusion, alarm, dismay, and slaughter, lay down under the pledged secu∣rity of public faith, to indulge nature in a few hours of respite, and troubled melancholy re∣pose.</Q> This is neither the sober stile of his∣tory, nor the intention of it. It leaves every thing to be guessed at, and mistaken. One would at least think there had been a battle; and a battle there probably would have been, had it not been for the moderating prudence of those whom Mr. Burke involves in his censures. By his keeping the <HI>Garde du Corps</HI> out of sight, Mr. Burke has afforded himself the dramatic licence of putting the King and Queen in their places, as if the ob∣ject of the expedition was against them.—But, to return to my account—</P>
<P>This conduct of the <HI>Garde du Corps,</HI> as might well be expected, alarmed and enraged the Pari∣sians. The colours of the cause, and the cause itself, were become too united to mistake the in∣tention of the insult, and the Parisians were deter∣mined to call the <HI>Garde du Corps</HI> to an account. There was certainly nothing of the cowardice of assassination in marching in the face of day to de∣mand
<PB N="42" REF="44"/>
satisfaction, if such a phrase may be used, of a body of armed men who had voluntarily given defiance. But the circumstance which serves to throw this affair into embarrassment is, that the enemies of the revolution appear to have encoura∣ged it, as well as its friends. The one hoped to prevent a civil war by checking it in time, and the other to make one. The hopes of those opposed to the revolution, rested in making the King of their party, and getting him from Versailles to Metz, where they expected to collect a force, and set up a standard. We have therefore two different ob∣jects presenting themselves at the same time, and to be accomplished by the same means: the one, to chastise the <HI>Garde du Corps,</HI> which was the object of the Parisians; the other, to render the confu∣sion of such a scene an inducement to the King to set off for Metz.</P>
<P>On the 5th of October, a very numerous body of women, and men in the disguise of women, collected round the Hotel de Ville or town-hall at Paris, and set off for Versailles. Their professed object was the <HI>Garde du Corps;</HI> but prudent men readily recollect that mischief is more easily begun than ended; and this impressed itself with the more force, from the suspicions already stated, and the irregularity of such a cavalcade. As soon there∣fore as a sufficient force could be collected, M. de la Fayette, by orders from the civil authority of Paris, set off after them at the head of twenty thousand of the Paris militia. The revolution could derive no benefit from confusion, and its
<PB N="43" REF="45"/>
opposers might. By an amiable and spirited man∣ner of address, he had hitherto been fortunate in calming disquietudes, and in this he was extraor∣dinarily successful; to frustrate, therefore, the hopes of those who might seek to improve this scene into a sort of justifiable necessity for the King's quitting Versailles and withdrawing to Metz, and to pre∣vent at the same time the consequences that might ensue between the <HI>Garde du Corps</HI> and this phalanx of men and women, he forwarded expresses to the King, that he was on his march to Versailles, by the orders of the civil authority of Paris, for the purpose of peace and protection, expressing at the same time the necessity of restraining the <HI>Garde du Corps</HI> from firing upon the people<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I am warranted in asserting this, as I had it personally from M. de la Fayette, with whom I have lived in habits of friendship for fourteen years.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>He arrived at Versailles between ten and eleven at night. The <HI>Garde du Corps</HI> was drawn up, and the people had arrived some time before, but every thing had remained suspended. Wisdom and policy now consisted in changing a scene of danger into a happy event. M. de la Fayette became the mediator between the enraged parties; and the King, to remove the uneasiness which had arisen from the delay already stated, sent for the President of the National Assembly, and signed the <HI>Declaration of the Rights of Man,</HI> and such other parts of the constitution as were in readiness.</P>
<P>It was now about one in the morning. Every thing appeared to be composed, and a general
<PB N="44" REF="46"/>
congratulation took place. By the beat of drum a proclamation was made, that the citizens of Versailles would give the hospitality of their houses to their fellow-citizens of Paris. Those who could not be accommodated in this manner, remained in the streets, or took up their quarters in the churches; and at two o'clock the King and Queen retired.</P>
<P>In this state matters passed till the break of day, when a fresh disturbance arose from the censurable conduct of some of both parties, for such charac∣ters there will be in all such scenes. One of the <HI>Garde du Corps</HI> appeared at one of the windows of the palace, and the people who had remained during the night in the streets accosted him with reviling and provocative language. Instead of retiring, as in such a case prudence would have dictated, he presented his musket, fired, and kil∣led one of the Paris militia. The peace being thus broken, the people rushed into the palace in quest of the offender. They attacked the quar∣ters of the <HI>Garde du Corps</HI> within the palace, and pursued them throughout the avenues of it, and to the apartments of the King. On this tumult, not the Queen only, as Mr. Burke has represented it, but every person in the palace, was awakened and alarmed; and M. de la Fayette had a second time to interpose between the parties, the event of which was, that the <HI>Garde du Corps</HI> put on the national cockade, and the matter ended as by oblivion, after the loss of two or three lives.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="47"/>During the latter part of the time in which this confusion was acting, the King and Queen were in public at the balcony, and neither of them concealed for safety's sake, as Mr. Burke in∣sinuates. Matters being thus appeased, and tran∣quillity restored, a general acclamation broke forth, of <HI>Le Roi à Paris—Le Roi à Paris</HI>—The King to Paris. It was the shout of peace, and immediately accepted on the part of the King. By this mea∣sure, all future projects of trapanning the King to Metz, and setting up the standard of opposition to the constitution, were prevented, and the suspi∣cions extinguished. The King and his family reached Paris in the evening, and were congra∣tulated on their arrival by Mr. Bailley the Mayor of Paris, in the name of the citizens. Mr. Burke, who throughout his book confounds things, per∣sons, and principles, has in his remarks on M. Bailley's address, confounded time also. He cen∣sures M. Bailley for calling it, <HI>"un bon jour,"</HI> a good day. Mr. Burke should have informed him∣self, that this scene took up the space of two days, the day on which it began with every appearance of danger and mischief, and the day on which it terminated without the mischiefs that threatened; and that it is to this peaceful termination that M. Bailley alludes, and to the arrival of the King at Paris. Not less than three hundred thousand persons arranged themselves in the procession from Versailles to Paris, and not an act of molestation was committed during the whole march.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="48"/>Mr. Burke, on the authority of M. Lally Tol∣lendal, a deserter from the National Assembly, says, that on entering Paris, the people shouted, <HI>"Tous les eveques à la lanterne."</HI> All Bishops to be hanged at the lanthorn or lamp-posts.—It is sur∣prising that nobody could hear this but Lally Tollendal, and that nobody should believe it but Mr. Burke. It has not the least connection with any part of the transaction, and is totally foreign to every circumstance of it. The bishops had never been introduced before into any scene of Mr. Burke's drama; Why then are they, all at once, and altogether, <HI>tout à coup et tous ensemble,</HI> introduced now? Mr. Burke brings forward his bishops and his lanthorn like figures in a magic lanthorn, and raises his scenes by contrast instead of connection. But it serves to shew, with the rest of his book, what little credit ought to be given, where even probability is set at defiance, for the purpose of defaming; and with this reflec∣tion, instead of a soliloquy in praise of chivalry, as Mr. Burke has done, I close the account of the expedition to Versailles<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">An account of the expedition to Versailles may be seen in No. 13. of the <HI>Revolution de Paris,</HI> containing the events from the 3d to the 10th of October 1789.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>I have now to follow Mr. Burke through a path∣less wilderness of rhapsodies, and a sort of descant upon governments, in which he asserts whatever he pleases, on the presumption of its being be∣lieved,
<PB N="47" REF="49"/>
without offering either evidence or rea∣sons for so doing.</P>
<P>Before any thing can be reasoned upon to a conclusion, certain facts, principles, or data, to reason from, must be established, admitted, or de∣nied. Mr. Burke, with his usual outrage, abuses the <HI>Declaration of the Rights of Man,</HI> published by the National Assembly of France as the basis on which the constitution of France is built. This he calls "paltry and blurred sheets of paper about the rights of man."—Does Mr. Burke mean to deny that <HI>man</HI> has any rights? If he does, then he must mean that there are no such things as rights any where, and that he has none himself; for who is there in the world but man? But if Mr. Burke means to admit that man has rights, the question then will be, What are those rights, and how came man by them originally?</P>
<P>The error of those who reason by precedents drawn from antiquity, respecting the rights of man, is, that they do not go far enough into an∣tiquity. They do not go the whole way. They stop in some of the intermediate stages of an hundred or a thousand years, and produce what was then done, as a rule for the present day. This is no au∣thority at all. If we travel still farther into anti∣quity, we shall find a direct contrary opinion and practice prevailing; and if antiquity is to be au∣thority, a thousand such authorities may be pro∣duced, successively contradicting each other: But if we proceed on, we shall at last come out right; we shall come to the time when man came from
<PB N="48" REF="50"/>
the hand of his Maker. What was he then? Man. Man was his high and only title, and a higher cannot be given him.—But of titles I shall speak hereafter.</P>
<P>We are now got at the origin of man, and at the origin of his rights. As to the manner in which the world has been governed from that day to this, it is no farther any concern of ours than to make a proper use of the errors or the improve∣ments which the history of it presents. Those who lived a hundred or a thousand years ago, were then moderns, as we are now. They had <HI>their</HI> ancients, and those ancients had others, and we also shall be ancients in our turn. If the mere name of anti∣quity is to govern in the affairs of life, the people who are to live an hundred or a thousand years hence, may as well take us for a precedent, as we make a precedent of those who lived an hundred or a thousand years ago. The fact is, that por∣tions of antiquity, by proving every thing, establish nothing. It is authority against authority all the way, till we come to the divine origin of the rights of man at the creation. Here our enquiries find a resting-place, and our reason finds a home. If a dispute about the rights of man had arisen at the distance of an hundred years from the creation, it is to this source of authority they must have re∣ferred, and it is to the same source of authority that we must now refer.</P>
<P>Though I mean not to touch upon any sectarian principle of religion, yet it may be worth observ∣ing, that the genealogy of Christ is traced to Adam.
<PB N="49" REF="51"/>
Why then not trace the rights of man to the crea∣tion of man? I will answer the question. Be∣cause there have been upstart governments thrusting themselves between, and presumptuously working to <HI>un-make</HI> man.</P>
<P>If any generation of men ever possessed the right of dictating the mode by which the world should be governed for ever, it was the first generation that existed; and if that generation did it not, no succeeding generation can shew any authority for doing it, nor can set any up. The illuminating and divine principle of the equal rights of man, (for it has its origin from the Maker of man) re∣lates, not only to the living individuals, but to ge∣nerations of men succeeding each other. Every generation is equal in rights to the generations which preceded it, by the same rule that every individual is born equal in rights with his contem∣porary.</P>
<P>Every history of the creation, and every tradi∣tionary account, whether from the lettered or un∣lettered world, however they may vary in their opinion or belief of certain particulars, all agree in establishing one point, <HI>the unity of man;</HI> by which I mean, that men are all of <HI>one degree,</HI> and consequently that all men are born equal, and with equal natural right, in the same manner as if po∣sterity had been continued by <HI>creation</HI> instead of <HI>generation,</HI> the latter being only the mode by which the former is carried forward; and consequently, every child born into the world must be considered as deriving its existence from God. The world is
<PB N="50" REF="52"/>
as new to him as it was to the first man that ex∣isted, and his natural right in it is of the same kind.</P>
<P>The Mosaic account of the creation, whether taken as divine authority, or merely historical, is full to this point, <HI>the unity or equality of man.</HI> The expressions admit of no controversy. <Q>And God said, Let us make man in our own image. In the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.</Q> The distinction of sexes is pointed out, but no other distinction is even implied If this be not divine authority, it is at least historical authority, and shews that the equality of man, so far from being a modern doc∣trine, is the oldest upon record.</P>
<P>It is also to be observed, that all the religions known in the world are founded, so far as they relate to man, on the <HI>unity of man,</HI> as being all of one degree. Whether in heaven or in hell, or in whatever state man may be supposed to exist here∣after, the good and the bad are the only distinc∣tions. Nay, even the laws of governments are obliged to slide into this principle, by making de∣grees to consist in crimes, and not in persons.</P>
<P>It is one of the greatest of all truths, and of the highest advantage to cultivate. By considering man in this light, and by instructing him to consi∣der himself in this light, it places him in a close connection with all his duties, whether to his Cre∣ator, or to the creation, of which he is a part; and it is only when he forgets his origin, or, to use a more fashionable phrase, his <HI>birth and family,</HI> that
<PB N="51" REF="53"/>
he becomes dissolute. It is not among the least of the evils of the present existing governments in all parts of Europe, that man, considered as man, is thrown back to a vast distance from his Maker, and the artificial chasm filled up by a succession of barriers, or sort of turnpike gates, through which he has to pass. I will quote Mr. Burke's catalogue of barriers that he has set up between man and his Maker. Putting himself in the character of a he∣rald, he says—<Q>We fear God—we look with <HI>awe</HI> to kings—with affection to parliaments—with duty to magistrates—with reverence to priests, and with respect to nobility.</Q> Mr. Burke has forgotten to put in <HI>"chivalry."</HI> He has also for∣gotten to put in Peter.</P>
<P>The duty of man is not a wilderness of turnpike gates, through which he is to pass by tickets from one to the other. It is plain and simple, and con∣sists but of two points. His duty to God, which every man must feel; and with respect to his neighbour, to do as he would be done by. If those to whom power is delegated do well, they will be respected; if not, they will be despised: and with regard to those to whom no power is de∣legated, but who assume it, the rational world can know nothing of them.</P>
<P>Hitherto we have spoken only (and that but in part) of the natural rights of man. We have now to consider the civil rights of man, and to shew how the one originates from the other. Man did not enter into society to become <HI>worse</HI> than he was before, nor to have fewer rights than he had
<PB N="52" REF="54"/>
before, but to have those rights better secured. His natural rights are the foundation of all his civil rights. But in order to pursue this distinction with more precision, it will be necessary to mark the different qualities of natural and civil rights.</P>
<P>A few words will explain this. Natural rights are those which appertain to man in right of his existence. Of this kind are all the intellectual rights, or rights of the mind, and also all those rights of acting as an individual for his own com∣fort and happiness, which are not injurious to the natural rights of others.—Civil rights are those which appertain to man in right of his being a member of society. Every civil right has for its foundation, some natural right pre-existing in the individual, but to the enjoyment of which his individual power is not, in all cases, sufficiently competent. Of this kind are all those which relate to security and protection.</P>
<P>From this short review, it will be easy to distin∣guish between that class of natural rights which man retains after entering into society, and those which he throws into the common stock as a mem∣ber of society.</P>
<P>The natural rights which he retains, are all those in which the <HI>power</HI> to execute is as perfect in the individual as the right itself. Among this class, as is before mentioned, are all the intellectual rights, or rights of the mind: consequently, re∣ligion is one of those rights. The natural rights which are not retained, are all those in which, though the right is perfect in the individual, the
<PB N="53" REF="55"/>
power to execute them is defective. They an∣swer not his purpose. A man, by natural right, has a right to judge in his own cause; and so far as the right of the mind is concerned, he never surrenders it: But what availeth it him to judge, if he has not power to redress? He therefore de∣posits this right in the common stock of society, and takes the arm of society, of which he is a part, in preference and in addition to his own. Society <HI>grants</HI> him nothing. Every man is a proprietor in society, and draws on the capital as a matter of right.</P>
<P>From these premises, two or three certain con∣clusions will follow.</P>
<P>First, That every civil right grows out of a na∣tural right; or, in other words, is a natural right exchanged.</P>
<P>Secondly, That civil power, properly considered as such, is made up of the aggregate of that class of the natural rights of man, which becomes de∣fective in the individual in point of power, and an∣swers not his purpose; but when collected to a focus, becomes competent to the purpose of every one.</P>
<P>Thirdly, That the power produced from the ag∣gregate of natural rights, imperfect in power in the individual, cannot be applied to invade the natu∣ral rights which are retained in the individual, and in which the power to execute is as per∣fect as the right itself.</P>
<P>We have now, in a few words, traced man from a natural individual to a member of society, and shewn, or endeavoured to shew, the quality of the
<PB N="54" REF="56"/>
natural rights retained, and of those which are ex∣changed for civil rights. Let us now apply these principles to governments.</P>
<P>In casting our eyes over the world, it is ex∣tremely easy to distinguish the governments which have arisen out of society, or out of the social com∣pact, from those which have not: but to place this in a clearer light than what a single glance may afford, it will be proper to take a review of the several sources from which governments have a∣risen, and on which they have been founded.</P>
<P>They may be all comprehended under three heads. First, Superstition. Secondly, Power. Thirdly, The common interest of society, and the common rights of man.</P>
<P>The first was a government of priestcraft, the second of conquerors, and the third of reason.</P>
<P>When a set of artful men pretended, through the medium of oracles, to hold intercourse with the Deity, as familiarly as they now march up the back∣stairs in European courts, the world was completely under the government of superstition. The oracles were consulted, and whatever they were made to say, became the law; and this sort of government lasted as long as this sort of superstition lasted.</P>
<P>After these a race of conquerors arose, whose government, like that of William the Conqueror, was founded in power, and the sword assumed the name of a scepter. Governments thus established, last as long as the power to support them lasts; but that they might avail themselves of every engine in their favour, they united fraud to force,
<PB N="55" REF="57"/>
and set up an idol which they called <HI>Divine Right,</HI> and which, in imitation of the Pope, who affects to be spiritual and temporal, and in contradiction to the Founder of the Christian religion, twisted itself afterwards into an idol of another shape, called <HI>Church and State.</HI> The key of St. Peter, and the key of the Treasury, became quartered on one another, and the wondering cheated multitude worshipped the invention.</P>
<P>When I contemplate the natural dignity of man; when I feel (for Nature has not been kind enough to me to blunt my feelings) for the honour and happiness of its character, I become irritated at the attempt to govern mankind by force and fraud, as if they were all knaves and fools, and can scarcely avoid disgust at those who are thus imposed upon.</P>
<P>We have now to review the governments which arise out of society, in contradistinction to those which arose out of superstition and conquest.</P>
<P>It has been thought a considerable advance to∣wards establishing the principles of Freedom, to say, that government is a compact between those who govern and those who are governed: but this can∣not be true, because it is putting the effect before the cause; for as man must have existed before governments existed, there necessarily was a time when governments did not exist, and consequently there could originally exist no governors to form such a compact with. The fact therefore must be, that the <HI>individuals themselves,</HI> each in his own personal and sovereign right, <HI>entered into a compact with each other</HI> to produce a government: and this
<PB N="56" REF="58"/>
is the only mode in which governments have a right to arise, and the only principle on which they have a right to exist.</P>
<P>To possess ourselves of a clear idea of what go∣vernment is, or ought to be, we must trace it to its origin. In doing this, we shall easily discover that governments must have arisen, either <HI>out</HI> of the people, or <HI>over</HI> the people. Mr. Burke has made no distinction. He investigates nothing to its source, and therefore he confounds every thing: but he has signified his intention of undertaking at some future opportunity, a comparison between the constitutions of England and France. As he thus renders it a subject of controversy by throwing the gauntlet, I take him up on his own ground. It is in high challenges that high truths have the right of appearing; and I accept it with the more readiness, because it affords me, at the same time, an opportunity of pursuing the subject with respect to governments arising out of society.</P>
<P>But it will be first necessary to define what is meant by a <HI>constitution.</HI> It is not sufficient that we adopt the word; we must fix also a standard signi∣fication to it.</P>
<P>A constitution is not a thing in name only, but in fact. It has not an ideal, but a real existence; and wherever it cannot be produced in a visible form, there is none. A constitution is a thing <HI>an∣tecedent</HI> to a government, and a government is only the creature of a constitution. The constitution of a country is not the act of its government, but of the people constituting a government. It is the
<PB N="57" REF="59"/>
body of elements, to which you can refer, and quote article by article; and which contains the principles on which the government shall be esta∣blished, the manner in which it shall be organized, the powers it shall have, the mode of elections, the duration of parliaments, or by what other name such bodies may be called; the powers which the executive part of the government shall have; and, in fine, every thing that relates to the compleat or∣ganization of a civil government, and the principles on which it shall act, and by which it shall be bound. A constitution, therefore, is to a govern∣ment, what the laws made afterwards by that go∣vernment are to a court of judicature. The court of judicature does not make the laws, neither can it alter them; it only acts in conformity to the laws made: and the government is in like manner go∣verned by the constitution.</P>
<P>Can then Mr. Burke produce the English Con∣stitution? If he cannot, we may fairly conclude, that though it has been so much talked about, no such thing as a constitution exists, or ever did exist, and consequently that the people have yet a constitution to form.</P>
<P>Mr. Burke will not, I presume, deny the position I have already advanced; namely, that govern∣ments arise, either <HI>out</HI> of the people, or <HI>over</HI> the people. The English government is one of those which arose out of a conquest, and not out of society, and consequently it arose over the people; and though it has been much modified from the opportunity of circumstances since the time of
<PB N="58" REF="60"/>
William the Conqueror, the country has never yet regenerated itself, and is therefore without a constitution.</P>
<P>I readily perceive the reason why Mr. Burke declined going into the comparison between the English and French constitutions, because he could not but perceive, when he sat down to the task, that no such thing as a constitution existed on his side the question. His book is certainly bulky enough to have contained all he could say on this subject, and it would have been the best manner in which people could have judged of their separate merits. Why then has he declined the only thing that was worth while to write upon? It was the strongest ground he could take, if the advantages were on his side; but the weakest, if they were not: and his declining to take it, is either a sign that he could not possess it, or could not maintain it.</P>
<P>Mr. Burke said in a speech last winter in parliament, That when the National Assembly first met in three Orders, (the Tiers Etats, the Clergy, and the Noblesse), France had then a good constitution. This shews, among nume∣rous other instances, that Mr. Burke does not understand what a constitution is. The persons so met, were not a <HI>constitution,</HI> but a <HI>convention,</HI> to make a constitution.</P>
<P>The present National Assembly of France is, strictly speaking, the personal social compact.— The members of it are the delegates of the na∣tion in its <HI>original</HI> character; future assemblies will be the delegates of the nation in its <HI>organized</HI>
<PB N="59" REF="61"/>
character. The authority of the present Assembly is different to what the authority of future Assem∣blies will be. The authority of the present one is to form a constitution: the authority of future Assemblies will be to legislate according to the principles and forms prescribed in that constitu∣tion; and if experience should hereafter shew that alterations, amendments, or additions, are neces∣sary, the constitution will point out the mode by which such things shall be done, and not leave it to the discretionary power of the future govern∣ment.</P>
<P>A government on the principles on which con∣stitutional governments arising out of society are established, cannot have the right of altering itself. If it had, it would be arbitrary. It might make itself what it pleased; and wherever such a right is set up, it shews there is no constitution. The act by which the English Parliament empowered itself to sit seven years, shews there is no constitu∣tion in England. It might, by the same self-authority, have sat any greater number of years, or for life. The Bill which the present Mr. Pitt brought into parliament some years ago, to reform parliament, was on the same erroneous principle. The right of reform is in the nation in its original character, and the constitutional method would be by a general convention elected for the purpose. There is, moreover, a paradox in the idea of vitia∣ted bodies reforming themselves.</P>
<P>From these preliminaries I proceed to draw some comparisons. I have already spoken of the
<PB N="60" REF="62"/>
declaration of rights; and as I mean to be as con∣cise as possible, I shall proceed to other parts of the French constitution.</P>
<P>The constitution of France says, That every man who pays a tax of sixty sous <HI>per annum,</HI> (2s. and 6d. English), is an elector.—What article will Mr. Burke place against this? Can any thing be more limited, and at the same time more capri∣cious, than the qualifications of electors are in England? Limited—because not one man in an hundred (I speak much within compass) is admit∣ted to vote: Capricious—because the lowest cha∣racter that can be supposed to exist, and who has not so much as the visible means of an honest live∣lihood, is an elector in some places; while, in other places, the man who pays very large taxes, and has a known fair character, and the farmer who rents to the amount of three or four hundred pounds a year, with a property on that farm to three or four times that amount, is not admit∣ted to be an elector. Every thing is out of nature, as Mr. Burke says on another occasion, in this strange chaos, and all sorts of follies are blended with all sorts of crimes. William the Conqueror and his descendants parcelled out the country in this manner, and bribed some parts of it by what they called Charters, to hold the other parts of it the better subjected to their will. This is the reason why so many of those charters abound in Cornwall; the people were averse to the government esta∣blished at the Conquest, and the towns were garri∣soned and bribed to enslave the country. All the
<PB N="61" REF="63"/>
old charters are the badges of this conquest, and it is from this source that the capriciousness of elections arises.</P>
<P>The French constitution says, That the number of representatives for any place shall be in a ratio to the number of taxable inhabitants or electors. What article will Mr. Burke place against this? The county of Yorkshire, which contains near a million of souls, sends two county members; and so does the county of Rutland, which contains not an hundredth part of that number. The town of old Sarum, which contains not three houses, sends two members; and the town of Manchester, which contains upwards of sixty thousand souls, is not ad∣mitted to send any. Is there any principle in these things? Is there any thing by which you can trace the marks of freedom, or discover those of wisdom? No wonder, then, Mr. Burke has decli∣ned the comparison, and endeavoured to lead his readers from the point by a wild unsystematical display of paradoxical rhapsodies.</P>
<P>The French constitution says, That the National Assembly shall be elected every two years.—What article will Mr. Burke place against this? Why, that the nation has no right at all in the case: that the government is perfectly arbitrary with respect to this point; and he can quote for his au∣thority, the precedent of a former parliament.</P>
<P>The French constitution says, There shall be no game laws; that the farmer on whose lands wild game shall be found (for it is by the produce of his lands they are fed) shall have a right to what
<PB N="62" REF="64"/>
he can take: That there shall be no monopolies of any kind—that all trade shall be free, and every man free to follow any occupation by which he can procure an honest livelihood, and in any place, town or city throughout the nation.—What will Mr. Burke say to this? In England, game is made the property of those at whose expence it is not sed; and with respect to monopolies, the country is cut up into monopolies. Every chartered town is an aristocratical monopoly in itself, and the qualification of electors proceeds out of those char∣tered monopolies. Is this freedom? Is this what Mr. Burke means by a constitution?</P>
<P>In these chartered monopolies, a man coming from another part of the country, is hunted from them as if he were a foreign enemy. An English∣man is not free of his own country: every one of those places presents a barrier in his way, and tells him he is not a freeman—that he has no rights. Within these monopolies, are other monopolies. In a city, such for instance as Bath, which contains between twenty and thirty thousand inhabitants, the right of electing representatives to parliament is monopolised by about thirty-one persons. And within these monopolies are still others. A man even of the same town, whose parents were not in circumstances to give him an occupation, is debar∣red, in many cases, from the natural right of ac∣quiring one, be his genius or industry what it may.</P>
<P>Are these things examples to hold out to a coun∣try regenerating itself from slavery, like France?— Certainly they are not; and certain am I, that when
<PB N="63" REF="65"/>
the people of England come to reflect upon them, they will, like France, annihilate those badges of ancient oppression, those traces of a conquered na∣tion.—Had Mr. Burke possessed talents similar to the author "On the Wealth of Nations," he would have comprehended all the parts which enter into, and, by assemblage, form a constitution. He would have reasoned from minutiae to magnitude. It is not from his prejudices only, but from the disorderly cast of his genius, that he is unfitted for the subject he writes upon. Even his genius is without a constitution. It is a genius at random, and not a genius constituted. But he must say something—He has therefore mounted in the air like a balloon, to draw the eyes of the multitude from the ground they stand upon.</P>
<P>Much is to be learned from the French consti∣tution. Conquest and tyranny transplanted them∣selves with William the Conqueror from Normandy into England, and the country is yet disfigured with the marks. May then the example of all France contribute to regenerate the freedom which a province of it destroyed!</P>
<P>The French constitution says, That to preserve the national representation from being corrupt, no member of the National Assembly shall be an officer of the government, a place-man, or a pen∣sioner.—What will Mr. Burke place against this? I will whisper his answer: <HI>Loaves</HI> and <HI>fishes.</HI> Ah! this government of loaves and fishes has more mis∣chief in it than people have yet reflected on. The National Assembly has made the discovery, and it
<PB N="64" REF="66"/>
holds out the example to the world. Had govern∣ments agreed to quarrel on purpose to fleece their countries by taxes, they could not have succeeded better than they have done.</P>
<P>Many things in the English government appear to me the reverse of what they ought to be, and of what they are said to be. The Parliament, imper∣fectly and capriciously elected as it is, is neverthe∣less <HI>supposed</HI> to hold the national purse in <HI>trust</HI> for the nation: but in the manner in which an English parliament is constructed, it is like a man being both mortgager and mortgagee; and in the case of misapplication of trust, it is the criminal sitting in judgment upon himself. If those who vote the supplies are the same persons who receive the sup∣plies when voted, and are to account for the expen∣diture of those supplies to those who voted them, it is <HI>themselves accountable to themselves,</HI> and the Co∣medy of Errors concludes with the Pantomine of HUSH. Neither the ministerial party, nor the op∣position, will touch upon this case. The national purse is the common hack which each mounts up∣on. It is like what the country people call, <Q>Ride and tie—You ride a little way, and then I <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is a practice in some parts of the country, when two travellers have but one horse, which like the national purse will not carry dou∣ble, that the one mounts and rides two or three miles a-head, and then ties the horse to a gate, and walks on. When the second travel∣ler arrives, he takes the horse, rides on, and passes his companion a mile or two, and ti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e again; and so on—<HI>Ride and tie.</HI></NOTE>.</Q>— They order these things better in France.</P>
<P>The French constitution says, That the right of war and peace is in the nation. Where else should it reside, but in those who are to pay the expence?</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="67"/>In England, this right is said to reside in a <HI>meta∣phor,</HI> shewn at the Tower for sixpence or a shilling a-piece: So are the lions; and it would be a step nearer to reason to say it resided in them, for any inanimate metaphor is no more than a hat or a cap. We can all see the absurdity of worshipping Aaron's molten calf, or Nebuchadnezzar's golden image; but why do men continue to practise themselves the absurdities they despise in others?</P>
<P>It may with reason be said, that in the manner the English nation is represented, it signifies not where this right resides, whether in the Crown, or in the Parliament. War is the common harvest of all those who participate in the division and ex∣penditure of public money, in all countries. It is the art of <HI>conquering at home:</HI> the object of it is an increase of revenue; and as revenue cannot be increased without taxes, a pretence must be made for expenditures. In reviewing the history of the English government, its wars and its taxes, a by-stander, not blinded by prejudice, nor warped by interest, would declare, that taxes were not raised to carry on wars, but that wars were raised to carry on taxes.</P>
<P>Mr. Burke, as a Member of the House of Com∣mons, is a part of the English Government; and though he professes himself an enemy to war, he abuses the French Constitution, which seeks to ex∣plode it. He holds up the English Government as a model in all its parts, to France; but he should first know the remarks which the French make upon it. They contend, in favour of their own,
<PB N="66" REF="68"/>
that the portion of liberty enjoyed in England, is just enough to enslave a country by, more produc∣tively than by despotism; and that as the real ob∣ject of all despotism is revenue, a Government so formed obtains more than it could do either by di∣rect despotism, or in a full state of freedom, and is therefore, on the ground of interest, opposed to both. They account also for the readiness which always appears in such governments for engaging in wars, by remarking on the different motives which produce them. In despotic governments, wars are the effect of pride; but in those govern∣ments in which they become the means of taxation, they acquire thereby a more permanent promptitude.</P>
<P>The French Constitution, therefore, to provide against both these evils, has taken away the power of declaring war from kings and ministers, and placed the right where the expence must fall.</P>
<P>When the question on the right of war and peace was agitating in the National Assembly, the people of England appeared to be much in∣terested in the event, and highly to applaud the decision.—As a principle, it applies as much to one country as to another. William the Con∣querer, <HI>as a conqueror,</HI> held this power of war and peace in himself, and his descendants have ever since claimed it under him as a right.</P>
<P>Although Mr. Burke has asserted the right of the parliament at the Revolution to bind and con∣troul the nation and posterity for <HI>ever,</HI> he denies, at the same time, that the parliament or the na∣tion had any right to alter what he calls the suc∣cession
<PB N="67" REF="69"/>
of the crown, in any thing but in part, or by a sort of modification. By his taking this ground, he throws the case back to the <HI>Norman Conquest;</HI> and by thus running a line of succession springing from William the Conqueror to the present day, he makes it necessary to enquire who and what William the Conqueror was, and where he came from; and into the origin, history, and nature of what are called perogatives. Every thing must have had a beginning, and the fog of time and antiquity should be penetrated to dis∣cover it. Let then Mr. Burke bring forward his William of Normandy, for it is to this origin that his argument goes. It also unfortunately happens, in running this line of succession, that another line, parallel thereto, presents itself, which is, that if the succession runs in the line of the con∣quest, the nation runs in the line of being con∣quered, and it ought to rescue itself from this reproach.</P>
<P>But it will perhaps be said, that tho' the power of declaring war descends in the heritage of the conquest, it is held in check by the right of the parliament to with-hold the supplies. It will always happen, when a thing is originally wrong, that amendments do not make it right; and it often happens, that they do as much mischief one way, as good the other: and such is the case here; for if the one rashly declares war as a matter of right, and the other peremptorily with-holds the supplies as a matter of right, the remedy becomes as bad, or worse than the disease. The one forces
<PB N="68" REF="70"/>
the nation to a combat, and the other ties its hands: but the more probable issue is, that the contest will end in a collusion between the parties, and be made a screen to both.</P>
<P>On this question of war, three things are to be considered. First, the right of declaring it: Secondly, the expence of supporting it: Thirdly, the mode of conducting it after it is declared. The French constitution places the <HI>right</HI> where the <HI>expence</HI> must fall, and this union can be only in the nation. The mode of conducting it after it is declared, it consigns to the executive depart∣ment.—Were this the case in all countries, we should hear but little more of wars.</P>
<P>Before I proceed to consider other parts of the French constitution, and by way of relieving the fatigue of argument, I will introduce an anecdote which I had from Dr. Frank∣lin.—</P>
<P>While the Doctor resided in France as mini∣ster from America during the war, he had nume∣rous proposals made to him by projectors of every country and of every kind, who wished to go to the land that floweth with milk and honey, America; and among the rest, there was one who offered himself to be King. He introduced his proposal to the Doctor by letter, which is now in the hands of M. Beaumarchais, of Paris—stat∣ing, first, that as the Americans had dismissed or sent away <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The word he used was <HI>renvoyé,</HI> dismissed or sent away.</NOTE> their King, that they would want
<PB N="69" REF="71"/>
another. Secondly, that himself was a Norman. Thirdly, that he was of a more ancient family than the Dukes of Normandy, and of a more honourable descent, his line having never been bastardized. Fourthly, that there was already a precedent in England, of Kings coming out of Normandy: and on these grounds he rested his offer, <HI>enjoining</HI> that the Doctor would forward it to America. But as the Doctor neither did this, nor yet sent him an answer, the projector wrote a second letter; in which he did not, it is true, threaten to go over and conquer America, but only with great dignity proposed, that if his offer was not accepted, an acknowledg∣ment of about £ 30,000 might be made to him for his generosity!—Now, as all arguments respecting succession must necessarily connect that succession with some beginning, Mr. Burke's arguments on this subject go to shew, that there is no English origin of kings, and that they are descendants of the Norman line in right of the Conquest. It may, therefore, be of service to his doctrine to make this story known, and to inform him, that in case of that natural extinction to which all mortality is subject, Kings may again be had from Normandy, on more reasonable terms than William the Conqueror; and conse∣quently, that the good people of England, at the Revolution of 1688, <HI>might have done much bet∣ter,</HI> had such a generous Norman as <HI>this</HI> known <HI>their</HI> wants, and they had known <HI>his.</HI> The chi∣valry character which Mr. Burke so much ad∣mires,
<PB N="70" REF="72"/>
is certainly much easier to make a bargain with, than a <HI>hard-dealing Dutchman.</HI>—But, to return to the matters of the constitution—</P>
<P>The French constitution says, <HI>There shall be no titles;</HI> and of consequence, all that class of equivocal generation, which in some countries is called <HI>"aristocracy,"</HI> and in others <HI>"nobility,"</HI> is done away, and the <HI>peer</HI> is exalted into MAN.</P>
<P>Titles are but nick-names, and every nick-name is a title. The thing is perfectly harmless in it∣self; but it marks a sort of foppery in the human character, which degrades it. It reduces man into the diminutive of man in things which are great, and the counterfeit of woman in things which are little. It talks about its fine <HI>blue ribbon</HI> like a girl, and shews its new <HI>garter</HI> like a child. A certain writer of some antiquity, says, <Q>When I was a child, I thought as a child; but when I became a man, I put away childish things.</Q></P>
<P>It is, properly, from the elevated mind of France, that the folly of titles has fallen. It has outgrown the baby-cloaths of <HI>Count</HI> and <HI>Duke,</HI> and breeched itself in manhood. France has not levelled; it has exalted. It has put down the dwarf, to set up the man. The punyism of a sense∣less word like <HI>Duke,</HI> or <HI>Count,</HI> or <HI>Earl,</HI> has ceased to please. Even those who possessed them have disowned the gibberish, and as they outgrew the rickets, have despised the rattle. The genuine mind of man, thirsting for its native home, soci∣ety, contemns the gewgaws that separate him
<PB N="71" REF="73"/>
from it. Titles are like circles drawn by the ma∣gician's wand, to contract the sphere of man's felicity. He lives immured within the Bastille of a word, and surveys at a distance the envied life of man.</P>
<P>Is it then any wonder that titles should fall in France? Is it not a greater wonder they should be kept up any-where? What are they? What is their worth, and "what is their amount?" When we think or speak of a <HI>Judge</HI> or a <HI>General,</HI> we associate with it the ideas of office and character; we think of gravity in the one, and bravery in the other: but when we use a word <HI>merely as a title,</HI> no ideas associate with it. Through all the vocabulary of Adam, there is not such an ani∣mal as a Duke or a Count; neither can we connect any certain idea with the words. Whether they mean strength or weakness, wisdom or folly, a child or a man, or the rider or the horse, is all equi∣vocal. What respect then can be paid to that which describes nothing, and which means noth∣ing? Imagination has given figure and character to centaurs, satyrs, and down to all the fairy tribe; but titles baffle even the powers of fancy, and are a chimerical non-descript.</P>
<P>But this is not all.—If a whole country is dis∣posed to hold them in contempt, all their value is gone, and none will own them. It is common opinion only that makes them any thing, or no∣thing, or worse than nothing. There is no occa∣sion to take titles away, for they take themselves away when society concurs to ridicule them. This
<PB N="72" REF="74"/>
species of imaginary consequence has visibly de∣clined in every part of Europe, and it hastens to its exit as the world of reason continues to rise. There was a time when the lowest class of what are called nobility was more thought of than the highest is now, and when a man in armour riding throughout Christendom in quest of adventures was more stared at than a modern Duke. The world has seen this folly fall, and it has fallen by being laughed at, and the farce of titles will follow its fate.—The patriots of France have discovered in good time, that rank and dignity in society must take a new ground. The old one has fallen through.—It must now take the substantial ground of character, instead of the chimerical ground of titles; and they have brought their titles to the altar, and made of them a burnt-offering to Reason.</P>
<P>If no mischief had annexed itself to the folly of titles, they would not have been worth a serious and formal destruction, such as the National As∣sembly have decreed them: and this makes it necessary to enquire farther into the nature and character of aristocracy.</P>
<P>That, then, which is called aristocracy in some countries, and nobility in others, arose out of the governments founded upon conquest. It was origi∣nally a military order, for the purpose of supporting military government, (for such were all govern∣ments founded in conquest); and to keep up a succession of this order for the purpose for which it was established, all the younger branches of those
<PB N="73" REF="75"/>
families were disinherited, and the law of <HI>primoge∣nitureship</HI> set up.</P>
<P>The nature and character of aristocracy shews it∣self to us in this law. It is a law against every law of nature, and Nature herself calls for its destruc∣tion. Establish family justice, and aristocracy falls. By the aristocratical law of primogenitureship, in a family of six children, five are exposed. Aristo∣cracy has never more than <HI>one</HI> child. The rest are begotten to be devoured. They are thrown to the cannibal for prey, and the natural parent prepares the unnatural repast.</P>
<P>As every thing which is out of nature in man, affects, more or less, the interest of society, so does this. All the children which the aristocracy dis∣owns (which are all, except the eldest) are, in ge∣neral, cast like orphans on a parish, to be pro∣vided for by the public, but at a greater charge.— Unnecessary offices and places in governments and courts are created at the expence of the public, to maintain them.</P>
<P>With what kind of parental reflections can the father or mother contemplate their younger off∣spring. By nature they are children, and by mar∣riage they are heirs; but by aristocracy they are bastards and orphans. They are the flesh and blood of their parents in one line, and nothing akin to them in the other. To restore, therefore, parents to their children, and children to their pa∣rents—relations to each other, and man to society —and to exterminate the monster Aristocracy, root and branch—the French constitution has destroyed
<PB N="74" REF="76"/>
the law of PRIMOGENITURESHIP. Here then lies the monster; and Mr. Burke, if he pleases, may write its epitaph.</P>
<P>Hitherto we have considered aristocracy chiefly in one point of view. We have now to consider it in another. But whether we view it before or be∣hind, or side-ways, or any way else, domestically or publicly, it is still a monster.</P>
<P>In France, aristocracy had one feature less in its countenance, than what it has in some other coun∣tries. It did not compose a body of hereditary le∣gislators. It was not <HI>"a corporation of aristocracy,"</HI> for such I have heard M. de la Fayette describe an English House of Peers. Let us then examine the grounds upon which the French constitution has resolved against having such a House in France.</P>
<P>Because, in the first place, as is already men∣tioned, aristocracy is kept up by family tyranny and injustice.</P>
<P>Secondly, Because there is an unnatural unfit∣ness in an aristocracy to be legislators for a nation. Their ideas of <HI>distributive justice</HI> are corrupted at the very source. They begin life by trampling on all their younger brothers and sisters, and relations of every kind, and are taught and educated so to do. With what ideas of justice or honour can that man enter a house of legislation, who ab∣sorbs in his own person the inheritance of a whole family of children, or doles out to them some piti∣ful portion with the insolence of a gift?</P>
<P>Thirdly, Because the idea of hereditary legisla∣tors is as inconsistent as that of hereditary judges,
<PB N="75" REF="77"/>
or hereditary juries; and as absurd as an hereditary mathematician, or an hereditary wise man; and as ridiculous as an hereditary poet-laureat.</P>
<P>Fourthly, Because a body of men holding them∣selves accountable to nobody, ought not to be trusted by any body.</P>
<P>Fifthly, Because it is continuing the uncivilized principle of governments founded in conquest, and the base idea of man having property in man, and governing him by personal right.</P>
<P>Sixthly, Because aristocracy has a tendency to degenerate the human species.—By the universal oeconomy of nature it is known, and by the in∣stance of the Jews it is proved, that the human spe∣cies has a tendency to degenerate, in any small number of persons, when separated from the gene∣ral stock of society, and intermarrying constantly with each other. It defeats even its pretended end, and becomes in time the opposite of what is noble in man. Mr. Burke talks of nobility; let him shew what it is. The greatest characters the world have known, have risen on the democratic floor. Arist∣ocracy has not been able to keep a proportionate pace with democracy. The artificial NOBLE shrinks into a dwarf before the NOBLE of Nature; and in the few instances of those (for there are some in all countries) in whom nature, as by a miracle, has survived in aristocracy, THOSE MEN DESPISE IT. —But it is time to proceed to a new subject.</P>
<P>The French constitution has reformed the con∣dition of the clergy. It has raised the income of the lower and middle classes, and taken from
<PB N="76" REF="78"/>
the higher. None is now less than twelve hun∣dred livres (fifty pounds sterling), nor any higher than about two or three thousand pounds. What will Mr. Burke place against this? Hear what he says.</P>
<P>He says, <Q>That the people of England can see without pain or grudging, an archbishop pre∣cede a duke; they can see a bishop of Durham, or a bishop of Winchester, in possession of £. 10,000 a-year; and cannot see why it is in worse hands than estates to the like amount in the hands of this earl or that 'squire.</Q> And Mr. Burke offers this as an example to France.</P>
<P>As to the first part, whether the archbishop precedes the duke, or the duke the bishop, it is, I believe, to the people in general, somewhat like <HI>Sternhold</HI> and <HI>Hopkins,</HI> or <HI>Hopkins</HI> and <HI>Stern∣hold;</HI> you may put which you please first: and as I confess that I do not understand the merits of this case, I will not contend it with Mr. Burke.</P>
<P>But with respect to the latter, I have something to say.—Mr. Burke has not put the case right.— The comparison is out of order, by being put be∣tween the bishop and the earl or the 'squire. It ought to be put between the bishop and the curate, and then it will stand thus: —<HI>The people of England can see without pain or grudging, a bishop of Durham, or a bishop of Winchester, in pos∣session of ten thousand pounds a-year, and a curate on thirty or forty pounds a-year, or less.</HI>—No, Sir, they certainly do not see those things without
<PB N="77" REF="79"/>
great pain or grudging. It is a case that applies itself to every man's sense of justice, and is one among many that calls aloud for a constitution.</P>
<P>In France, the cry of <HI>"the church! the church!"</HI> was repeated as often as in Mr. Burke's book, and as loudly as when the dissenters' bill was be∣fore the English parliament; but the generality of the French clergy were not to be deceived by this cry any longer. They knew, that whatever the pretence might be, it was themselves who were one of the principal objects of it. It was the cry of the high beneficed clergy, to prevent any regulation of income taking place between those of ten thousand pounds a-year and the parish priest. They, therefore, joined their case to those of every other oppressed class of men, and by this union obtained redress.</P>
<P>The French constitution has abolished tythes, that source of perpetual discontent between the tythe-holder and the parishioner. When land is held on tythe, it is in the condition of an estate held between two parties; the one receiving one-tenth, and the other nine-tenths of the produce: and, consequently, on principles of equity, if the estate can be improved, and made to produce by that improvement double or treble what it did before, or in any other ratio, the expence of such improvement ought to be borne in like propor∣tion between the parties who are to share the pro∣duce. But this is not the case in tythes; the farmer bears the whole expence, and the tythe-holder takes a tenth of the improvement, in ad∣dition
<PB N="78" REF="80"/>
to the original tenth, and by this means gets the value of two-tenths instead of one. This is another case that calls for a constitution.</P>
<P>The French constitution hath abolished or re∣nounced <HI>Toleration,</HI> and <HI>Intolerance</HI> also, and hath established UNIVERSAL RIGHT OF CONSCIENCE.</P>
<P>Toleration is not the <HI>opposite</HI> of Intolerance, but is the <HI>counterfeit</HI> of it. Both are despotisms. The one assumes to itself the right of with-hold∣ing Liberty of Conscience, and the other of granting it. The one is the pope armed with fire and faggot, and the other is the pope selling or granting indulgencies. The former is church and state, and the latter is church and traffic.</P>
<P>But Toleration may be viewed in a much stronger light. Man worships not himself, but his Maker; and the liberty of conscience which he claims, is not for the service of himself, but of his God. In this case, therefore, we must necessarily have the associated idea of two beings; the <HI>mortal</HI> who renders the worship, and the IM∣MORTAL BEING who is worshipped. Toleration, therefore, places itself, not between man and man, nor between church and church, nor be∣tween one denomination of religion and ano∣ther, but between God and man; between the being who worships, and the BEING who is wor∣shipped; and by the same act of assumed autho∣rity by which it tolerates man to pay his worship, it presumptuously and blasphemously sets itself up to tolerate the Almighty to receive it.</P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="81"/>Were a Bill brought into any parliament, in∣titled <Q>AN ACT to tolerate or grant liberty to the Almighty to receive the worship of a Jew or a Turk,</Q> or <Q>to prohibit the Almighty from receiving it,</Q> all men would startle, and call it blasphemy. There would be an uproar. The presumption of toleration in religious mat∣ters would then present itself unmasked: but the presumption is not the less because the name of "Man" only appears to those laws, for the associated idea of the <HI>worshipper</HI> and the <HI>worship∣ped</HI> cannot be separated.—Who, then, art thou, vain dust and ashes! by whatever name thou art called, whether a King, a Bishop, a Church or a State, a Parliament, or any thing else, that obtrudest thine insignificance between the soul of man and its Maker? Mind thine own concerns. If he believes not as thou believest, it is a proof that thou believest not as he believeth, and there is no earthly power can determine between you.</P>
<P>With respect to what are called denominations of religion, if every one is left to judge of its own religion, there is no such thing as a religion that is wrong; but if they are to judge of each others religion, there is no such thing as a religion that is right; and therefore, all the world is right, or all the world is wrong. But with respect to religion itself, without regard to names, and as directing itself from the universal family of man∣kind to the Divine object of all adoration, <HI>it is man bringing to his Maker the fruits of his heart;</HI> and though those fruits may differ from each other
<PB N="80" REF="82"/>
like the fruits of the earth, the grateful tribute of every one is accepted.</P>
<P>A Bishop of Durham, or a Bishop of Winche∣ster, or the Archbishop who heads the Dukes, will not refuse a tythe-sheaf of wheat, because it is not a cock of hay; nor a cock of hay, because it is not a sheaf of wheat; nor a pig, because it is neither one nor the other: but these same persons, under the figure of an established church, will not permit their Maker to receive the varied tythes of man's devotion.</P>
<P>One of the continual choruses of Mr. Burke's book is, "Church and State." He does not mean some one particular church, or some one parti∣cular state, but any church and state; and he uses the term as a general figure to hold forth the po∣litical doctrine of always uniting the church with the state in every country, and he censures the National Assembly for not having done this in France.—Let us bestow a few thoughts on this subject.</P>
<P>All religions are in their nature kind and be∣nign, and united with principles of morality. They could not have made proselites at first, by professing any thing that was vicious, cruel, per∣secuting, or immoral. Like every thing else, they had their beginning; and they proceeded by persuasion, exortation, and example. How then is it that they lose their native mildness, and become morose and intolerent?</P>
<P>It proceeds from the connection which Mr. Burke recommends. By engendering the church
<PB N="81" REF="83"/>
with the state, a sort of mule animal, capable only of destroying, and not of breeding up, is pro∣duced, called <HI>The Church established by Law.</HI> It is a stranger, even from its birth, to any parent mother on which it is begotten, and whom in time it kicks out and destroys.</P>
<P>The inquisition in Spain does not proceed from the religion originally professed, but from this mule-animal, engendered between the church and the state. The burnings in Smithfield proceeded from the same heterogeneous production; and it was the regeneration of this strange animal in England afterwards, that renewed rancour and ir∣religion among the inhabitants, and that drove the people called Quakers and Dissenters to America. Persecution is not an original feature in <HI>any</HI> reli∣gion; but it is always the strongly-marked feature of all law-religions, or religions established by law. Take away the law-establishment, and every religion reassumes its original benignity. In Ame∣rica, a Catholic Priest is a good citizen, a good character, and a good neighbour; an Episcopa∣lian Minister is of the same description: and this proceeds, independently of the men, from there being no law-establishment in America.</P>
<P>If also we view this matter in a temporal sense, we shall see the ill effects it has had on the pros∣perity of nations. The union of church and state has impoverished Spain. The revoking the edict of Nantes drove the silk manufacture from France into England; and church and state are now driving the cotton manufacture from Eng∣land
<PB N="82" REF="84"/>
to America and France. Let then Mr. Burke continue to preach his antipolitical doc∣trine of Church and State. It will do some good. The National Assembly will not follow his advice, but will benefit by his folly. It was by observing the ill effects of it in England, that America has been warned against it; and it is by experiencing them in France, that the National Assembly have abolished it, and, like America, have established UNIVERSAL RIGHT OF CONSCIENCE, AND UNI∣VERSAL RIGHT OF CITIZENSHIP<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">When in any country we see extraordinary circumstances taking place, they naturally lead any man who has a talent for observation and investigation, to enquire into the causes. The manufactures of Manchester, Birmingham, and Sheffield, are the principal ma∣nufactures in England. From whence did this arise? A little ob∣servation will explain the case. The principal, and the generality of the inhabitants of those places, are not of what is called in Eng∣land, <HI>the church established by law;</HI> and they, or their fathers, (for it is within but a few years), withdrew from the persecution of the chartered towns, where test-laws more particularly operate, and established a s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rt of asylum for themselves in those places. It was the only asylum that then offered, for the rest of Europe was worse.—But the case is now changing. France and America bid a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> comers welcome, and initiate them into all the rights of citizen∣ship. Policy and interest, therefore, will, but perhaps too late, dic∣tate in England, what reason and justice could not. Those manu∣factures are withdrawing, and are arising in other places. There is now erecting at Passey, three miles from Paris, a large cotton-mill, and several are already erected in America. Soon after the rejecting the Bill for repealing the test-law, one of the richest manufacture<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s in England said in my hearing, "England, Sir, is not a country for a dissenter to live in—we must go to France." These are truths, and it is doing justice to both parties to tell them. It is chiefly the dissenters who have carried English manufactures to the height they are now at, and the same men have it in their power to carry them away; and though those manufactures will afterwards continue to be made in those places, the foreign market will be lost. There are frequently appearing in the London Gazette, extracts from certain acts to prevent machines and persons, as far as they can extend to persons, from going out of the country. It appears from these, that the ill effects of the test-laws and church-establishment begin to be much suspected; but the remedy of force can never supply the re∣medy of reason. In the progress of less than a century, all the un∣represented part of England, of all denominations, which is at least a hundred times the most numerous, may begin to feel the necessity of a constitution, and then all those matters will come regularly be∣fore them.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>I will here cease the comparison with respect to the principles of the French constitution, and conclude this part of the subject with a few ob∣servations on the organization of the formal parts of the French and English governments.</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="85"/>The executive power in each country is in the hands of a person stiled the King; but the French constitution distinguishes between the King and the Sovereign: It considers the station of King as official, and places Sovereignty in the nation.</P>
<P>The representatives of the nation, who com∣pose the National Assembly, and who are the le∣gislative power, originate in and from the people by election, as an inherent right in the people.— In England it is otherwise; and this arises from the original establishment of what is called its monarchy; for, as by the conquest all the rights of the people or the nation were absorbed into the hands of the Conqueror, and who added the title of King to that of Conqueror, those same matters which in France are now held as rights in the people, or in the nation, are held in Eng∣land as grants from what is called the Crown.
<PB N="84" REF="86"/>
The Parliament in England, in both its branches, was erected by patents from the descendants of the Conqueror. The House of Commons did not originate as a matter of right in the people to de∣legate or elect, but as a grant or boon.</P>
<P>By the French constitution, the Nation is always named before the King. The third article of the Declaration of rights says, "<HI>The nation is essential∣ly the source</HI> (or fountain) <HI>of all sovereignty.</HI>" Mr. Burke argues, that, in England, a King is the fountain—that he is the fountain of all honour. But as this idea is evidently descended from the Conquest, I shall make no other remark upon it, than that it is the nature of conquest to turn every thing upside down; and as Mr. Burke will not be refused the privilege of speaking twice, and as there are but two parts in the figure, the <HI>fountain</HI> and the <HI>spout,</HI> he will be right the second time.</P>
<P>The French constitution puts the legislative be∣fore the executive; the Law before the King; <HI>La Loi, Le Roi.</HI> This also is in the natural order of things; because laws must have existence, be∣fore they can have execution.</P>
<P>A King in France does not, in addressing him∣self to the National Assembly, say, "My assem∣bly," similar to the phrase used in England of "<HI>my</HI> Parliament;" neither can he use it consistently with the constitution, nor could it be admitted. There may be propriety in the use of it in Eng∣land, because, as is before mentioned, both Houses of Parliament originated from what is called the Crown by patent or boon—and not from the
<PB N="85" REF="87"/>
inherent rights of the people, as the National Assembly does in France, and whose name desig∣nates its origin.</P>
<P>The President of the National Assembly does not ask the King <HI>to grant to the Assembly liberty of speech,</HI> as is the case with the English House of Commons. The constitutional dignity of the National Assembly cannot debase itself. Speech is, in the first place, one of the natural rights of man always retained; and with respect to the Na∣tional Assembly, the use of it is their <HI>duty,</HI> and the nation is their <HI>authority.</HI> They were elected by the greatest body of men exercising the right of election the European world ever saw. They sprung not from the filth of rotten boroughs, nor are they the vassal representatives of aristocratical ones. Feeling the proper dignity of their cha∣racter, they support it. Their parliamentary lan∣guage, whether for or against a question, is free, bold, and manly, and extends to all the parts and circumstances of the case. If any matter or sub∣ject respecting the executive department, or the person who presides in it, (the King), comes be∣fore them, it is debated on with the spirit of men, and the language of gentlemen; and their answer, or their address, is returned in the same stile. They stand not aloof with the gaping vacuity of vulgar ignorance, nor bend with the cringe of sycophantic insignificance. The graceful pride of truth knows no extremes, and preserves, in every latitude of life, the right-angled character of man.</P>
<P><PB N="86" REF="88"/>Let us now look to the other side of the ques∣tion.—In the addresses of the English Parliaments to their Kings, we see neither the intrepid spirit of the old Parliaments of France, nor the serene dignity of the present National Assembly; neither do we see in them any thing of the stile of Eng∣lish manners, which border somewhat on blunt∣ness. Since then they are neither of foreign ex∣traction, nor naturally of English production, their origin must be sought for elsewhere, and that ori∣gin is the Norman Conquest. They are evidently of the vassalage class of manners, and emphati∣cally mark the prostrate distance that exists in no other condition of men than between the conquer∣or and the conquered. That this vassalage idea and stile of speaking was not got rid of even at the Revolution of 1688, is evident from the de∣claration of Parliament to William and Mary, in these words: <Q>We do most humbly and faith∣fully <HI>submit</HI> ourselves, our heirs and posterities, for ever.</Q> Submission is wholly a vassalage term, requgnant to the dignity of Freedom, and an echo of the language used at the Conquest.</P>
<P>As the estimation of all things is by comparison, the Revolution of 1688, however from circum∣stances it may have been exalted beyond its va∣lue, will find its level. It is already on the wane, eclipsed by the enlarging orb of reason, and the luminous revolutions of America and France. In less than another century, it will go, as well as Mr. Burke's labours, "to the family vault of all the Capulets." Mankind will then scarcely believe
<PB N="87" REF="89"/>
that a country calling itself free, would send to Holland for a man, and clothe him with power, on purpose to put themselves in fear of him, and give him almost a million sterling a-year for leave to <HI>submit</HI> themselves and their posterity, like bond-men and bond-women, for ever.</P>
<P>But there is a truth that ought to be made known: I have had the opportunity of seeing it; which is, <HI>that, notwithstanding appearances, there is not any description of men that despise monarchy so much as courtiers.</HI> But they well know, that if it were seen by others, as it is seen by them, the juggle could not be kept up. They are in the con∣dition of men who get their living by a show, and to whom the folly of that show is so familiar that they ridicule it; but were the audience to be made as wise in this respect as themselves, there would be an end to the show and the profits with it. The difference between a republican and a cour∣tier with respect to monarchy, is, that the one op∣poses monarchy, believing it to be something; and the other laughs at it, knowing it to be nothing.</P>
<P>As I used sometimes to correspond with Mr. Burke, believing him then to be a man of sounder principles than his book shews him to be, I wrote to him last winter from Paris, and gave him an account how prosperously matters were going on. Among other subjects in that letter, I referred to the happy situation the National Assembly were placed in; that they had taken a ground on which their moral duty and their political interest were united. They have not to hold out a language
<PB N="88" REF="90"/>
which they do not themselves believe, for the fraudulent purpose of making others believe it. Their station requires no artifice to support it, and can only be maintained by enlightening mankind. It is not their interest to cherish ignorance, but to dispel it. They are not in the case of a ministerial or an opposition party in England, who, though they are opposed, are still united to keep up the common mystery. The National Assembly must throw open a magazine of light. It must shew man the proper character of man; and the nearer it can bring him to that standard, the stronger the National Assembly becomes.</P>
<P>In contemplating the French constitution, we see in it a rational order of things. The princi∣ples harmonise with the forms, and both with their origin. It may perhaps be said as an excuse for bad forms, that they are nothing more than forms; but this is a mistake. Forms grow out of principles, and operate to continue the prin∣ciples they grow from. It is impossible to prac∣tise a bad form on any thing but a bad principle. It cannot be ingrafted on a good one; and where∣ever the forms in any government are bad, it is a certain indication that the principles are bad also.</P>
<P>I will here finally close this subject. I began it by remarking that Mr. Burke had <HI>voluntarily</HI> de∣clined going into a comparison of the English and French constitutions. He apologises (in page 241) for not doing it, by saying that he had not time. Mr. Burke's book was upwards of eight months in hand, and is extended to a volume of
<PB N="89" REF="91"/>
three hundred and sixty-six pages. As his omis∣sion does injury to his cause, his apology makes it worse; and men on the English side the water will begin to consider, whether there is not some radical defect in what is called the English con∣stitution, that made it necessary for Mr. Burke to suppress the comparison, to avoid bringing it into view.</P>
<P>As Mr. Burke has not written on constitutions, so neither has he written on the French revolution. He gives no account of its commencement or its progress. He only expresses his wonder. "It looks," says he, <Q>to me, as if I were in a great crisis, not of the affairs of France alone, but of all Europe, perhaps of more than Europe. All circumstances taken together, the French revolution is the most astonishing that has hitherto happened in the world.</Q></P>
<P>As wise men are astonished at foolish things, and other people at wise ones, I know not on which ground to account for Mr. Burke's asto∣nishment; but certain it is, that he does not un∣derstand the French revolution. It has apparently burst forth like a creation from a chaos, but it is no more than the consequence of a mental revolu∣tion priorily existing in France. The mind of the nation had changed before hand, and the new order of things has naturally followed the new order of thoughts.—I will here, as concisely as I can, trace out the growth of the French revolu∣tion, and mark the circumstances that have con∣tributed to produce it.</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="92"/>The despotism of Louis XIV. united with the gaiety of his Court, and the gaudy ostentation of his character, had so humbled, and at the same time so fascinated the mind of France, that the people appeared to have lost all sense of their own dignity, in contemplating that of their grand Mo∣narch: and the whole reign of Louis XV. re∣markable only for weakness and effeminacy, made no other alteration than that of spreading a sort of lethargy over the nation, from which it shewed no disposition to rise.</P>
<P>The only signs which appeared of the spirit of Liberty during those periods, are to be found in the writings of the French philosophers. Mon∣tesquieu, president of the Parliament of Bour∣deaux, went as far as a writer under a despotic government could well proceed; and being obliged to divide himself between principle and prudence, his mind often appears under a veil, and we ought to give him credit for more than he has expressed.</P>
<P>Voltaire, who was both the flatterer and the satirist of despotism, took another line. His forte lay in exposing and ridiculing the supersti∣tions which priest-craft united with state-craft had interwoven with governments. It was not from the purity of his principles, or his love of mankind, (for satire and philanthropy are not naturally concordant), but from his strong capa∣city of seeing folly in its true shape, and his ir∣resistible propensity to expose it, that he made those attacks. They were however as formida∣ble
<PB N="91" REF="93"/>
as if the motives had been virtuous; and he merits the thanks, rather than the esteem of man∣kind.</P>
<P>On the contrary, we find in the writings of Rousseau, and the Abbé Raynal, a loveliness of sentiment in favour of Liberty, that excites re∣spect, and elevates the human faculties; but having raised this animation, they do not direct its operations, and leave the mind in love with an object, without describing the means of pos∣sessing it.</P>
<P>The writings of Quesnay, Turgot, and the friends of those authors, are of the serious kind; but they laboured under the same disadvantage with Montesquieu: their writings abound with moral maxims of government, but are rather directed to oeconomise and reform the administration of the government, than the government itself.</P>
<P>But all those writings and many others had their weight; and by the different manner in which they treated the subject of government, Montesquieu by his judgment and knowledge of laws, Voltaire by his wit, Rousseau and Ray∣nal by their animation, and Quesnay and Turgot by their moral maxims and systems of oeconomy, readers of every class met with something to their taste, and a spirit of political enquiry began to diffuse itself through the nation at the time the dispute between England and the then colonies of America broke out.</P>
<P>In the war which France afterwards engaged in, it is very well known that the nation appeared
<PB N="92" REF="94"/>
to be before hand with the French ministry. Each of them had its view: but those views were di∣rected to different objects; the one sought liberty, and the other retaliation on England. The French officers and soldiers who after this went to Ame∣rica, were eventually placed in the school of Freedom, and learned the practice as well as the principles of it by heart.</P>
<P>As it was impossible to separate the military events which took place in America from the principles of the American revolution, the pub∣lication of those events in France necessarily con∣nected themselves with the principles which pro∣duced them. Many of the facts were in them∣selves principles; such as the declaration of American independence, and the treaty of alliance between France and America, which recognised the natural right of man, and justified resistance to oppression.</P>
<P>The then Minister of France, Count Vergennes, was not the friend of America; and it is both justice and gratitude to say, that it was the Queen of France who gave the cause of America a fashion at the French Court. Count Vergennes was the personal and social friend of Dr. Frank∣lin; and the Doctor had obtained, by his sensible gracefulness, a sort of influence over him; but with respect to principles, Count Vergennes was a despot.</P>
<P>The situation of Dr. Franklin as Minister from America to France, should be taken into the
<PB N="93" REF="95"/>
chain of circumstances. The diplomatic cha∣racter is of itself the narrowest sphere of society that man can act in. It forbids intercourse by a reciprocity of suspicion; and a diplomatic is a sort of unconnected atom, continually repelling and repelled. But this was not the case with Dr. Franklin. He was not the diplomatic of a Court, but of MAN. His character as a philosopher had been long established, and his circle of society in France was universal.</P>
<P>Count Vergennes resisted for a considerable time the publication in France of the American constitutions, translated into the French language; but even in this he was obliged to give way to public opinion, and a sort of propriety in admit∣ting to appear what he had undertaken to defend. The American constitutions were to liberty, what a grammar is to language: they define its parts of speech, and practically construct them into syntax.</P>
<P>The peculiar situation of the then Marquis de la Fayette is another link in the great chain. He served in America as an American officer un∣der a commission of Congress, and by the univer∣sality of his acquaintance, was in close friendship with the civil government of America, as well as with the military line. He spoke the language of the country, entered into the discussions on the principles of government, and was always a wel∣come friend at any election.</P>
<P>When the war closed, a vast reinforcement to the cause of Liberty spread itself over France, by
<PB N="94" REF="96"/>
the return of the French officers and soldiers. A knowledge of the practice was then joined to the theory; and all that was wanting to give it real existence, was opportunity. Man cannot, pro∣perly speaking, make circumstances for his pur∣pose, but he always has it in his power to improve them when they occur; and this was the case in France.</P>
<P>M. Neckar was displaced in May 1781; and by the ill management of the finances afterwards, and particularly during the extravagant admini∣stration of M. Calonne, the revenue of France, which was nearly twenty-four millions sterling <HI>per</HI> year, was become unequal to the expenditure, not because the revenue had decreased, but because the expences had increased; and this was the cir∣cumstance which the nation laid hold of to bring forward a revolution. The English Minister, Mr. Pitt, has frequently alluded to the state of the French finances in his budgets, without un∣derstanding the subject. Had the French Parlia∣ments been as ready to register edicts for new taxes, as an English Parliament is to grant them, there had been no derangement in the finances, nor yet any revolution; but this will better ex∣plain itself as I proceed.</P>
<P>It will be necessary here to shew how taxes were formerly raised in France. The King, or rather the Court or Ministry acting under the use of that name, framed the edicts for taxes at their own discretion, and sent them to the Parliaments to be registered; for until they were registered
<PB N="95" REF="97"/>
by the Parliaments, they were not operative. Dis∣putes had long existed between the Court and the Parliaments with respect to the extent of the Par∣liament's authority on this head. The Court insisted that the authority of Parliaments went no farther than to remonstrate or shew reasons against the tax, reserving to itself the right of determining whether the reasons were well or ill-founded; and in consequence thereof, either to withdraw the edict as a matter of choice, or to <HI>order</HI> it to be enregistered as a matter of authority. The Par∣liaments on their part insisted, that they had not only a right to remonstrate, but to reject; and on this ground they were always supported by the Nation.</P>
<P>But, to return to the order of my narrative— M. Calonne wanted money; and as he knew the sturdy disposition of the Parliaments with respect to new taxes, he ingeniously sought either to approach them by a more gentle means than that of direct authority, or to get over their heads by a manoeuvre: and, for this purpose, he revived the project of assembling a body of men from the several provinces, under the stile of an "Assem∣bly of the Notables," or Men of Note, who met in 1787, and who were either to recommend taxes to the Parliaments, or to act as a Parlia∣ment themselves. An Assembly under this name had been called in 1617.</P>
<P>As we are to view this as the first practical step towards the revolution, it will be proper to enter into some particulars respecting it. The Assem∣bly
<PB N="96" REF="98"/>
of the Notables has in some places been mis∣taken for the States-General, but was wholly a different body; the States-General being always by election. The persons who composed the As∣sembly of the Notables were all nominated by the King, and consisted of one hundred and forty members. But as M. Calonne could not depend upon a majority of this Assembly in his favour, he very ingeniously arranged them in such a man∣ner as to make forty-four a majority of one hun∣dred and forty: to effect this, he disposed of them into seven separate committees, of twenty mem∣bers each. Every general question was to be decided, not by a majority of persons, but by a majority of committees; and as eleven votes would make a majority in a committee, and four committees a majority of seven, M. Calonne had good reason to conclude, that as forty-four would determine any general question, he could not be out-voted. But all his plans deceived him, and in the event became his overthrow.</P>
<P>The then Marquis de la Fayette was placed in the second committee, of which Count D'Artois was president: and as money-matters was the object, it naturally brought into view every cir∣cumstance connected with it. M. de la Fayette made a verbal charge against Calonne, for selling crown-lands to the amount of two millions of livres, in a manner that appeared to be unknown to the King. The Count D'Artois (as if to inti∣midate, for the Bastille was then in being) asked the Marquis, if he would render the charge in
<PB N="97" REF="99"/>
writing? He replied, that he would.—The Count D'Artois did not demand it, but brought a message from the King to that purport. M. de la Fayette then delivered in his charge in writing, to be given to the King, undertak∣ing to support it. No farther proceedings were had upon this affair; but M. Calonne was soon after dismissed by the King, and set off to England.</P>
<P>As M. de la Fayette, from the experience of what he had seen in America, was better ac∣quainted with the science of civil government than the generality of the members who com∣posed the Assembly of the Notables could then be, the brunt of the business fell considerably to his share. The plan of those who had a constitu∣tion in view, was to contend with the Court on the ground of taxes, and some of them openly professed their object. Disputes frequently arose between Count D'Artois and M. de la Fayette, upon various subjects. With respect to the ar∣rears already incurred, the latter proposed to remedy them, by accommodating the expences to the revenue, instead of the revenue to the expences; and as objects of reform, he pro∣posed to abolish the Bastille, and all the State-prisons throughout the nation, (the keeping of which was attended with great expence), and to suppress <HI>Lettres de Cachet:</HI> But those matters were not then much attended to; and with respect to <HI>Lettres de Cachet, a majority of the Nobles appeared to be in favour of them.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="100"/>On the subject of supplying the Treasury by new taxes, the Assembly declined taking the matter on themselves, concurring in the opini∣on that they had not authority. In a debate on this subject, M. de la Fayette said, that raising money by taxes could only be done by a Na∣tional Assembly, freely elected by the people, and acting as their representatives. Do you mean, said the Count D'Artois, the <HI>States Ge∣neral?</HI> M. de la Fayette replied, that he did. Will you, said the Count D'Artois, sign what you say, to be given to the King? The other replied, that he not only would do this, but that he would go farther, and say, that the effectual mode would be, for the King to agree to the establishment of a Constitution.</P>
<P>As one of the plans had thus failed, that of getting the Assembly to act as a Praliament, the other came into view, that of recom∣mending. On this subject, the Assembly agreed to recommend two new taxes to be enregistered by the Parliament: The one a stamp-tax, and the other a territorial tax, or sort of land-tax. The two have been estimated at about five millions sterl. <HI>per ann.</HI> We have now to turn our atten∣tion to the Parliaments, on whom the business was again devolving.</P>
<P>The Archbishop of Thoulouse (since Arch∣bishop of Sens, and now a Cardinal) was ap∣pointed to the administration of the finances, soon after the dismission of Calonne. He was also made Prime Minister, an office that did not
<PB N="99" REF="101"/>
always exist in France. When this office did not exist, the Chief of each of the principal de∣partments transacted business immediately with the King; but when a Prime Minister was ap∣pointed, they did business only with him. The Archbishop arrived to more State-authority than any Minister since the Duke de Choiseul, and the nation was strongly disposed in his fa∣vour; but by a line of conduct scarcely to be accounted for, he perverted every opportunity, turned out a despot, and sunk into disgrace, and a Cardinal.</P>
<P>The Assembly of the Notables having broken up, the new Minister sent the edicts for the two new taxes recommended by the Assembly to the Parliaments, to be enregistered. They of course came first before the parliament of Paris, who returned for answer, <HI>That with such a reve∣nue as the Nation then supported, the name of taxes ought not to be mentioned, but for the purpose of reducing them;</HI> and threw both the edicts out <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">When the English Minister, Mr. Pitt, mentions the French finances again in the English Parliament, it would be well that he noticed this as an example.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>On this refusal, the Parliament was ordered to Versailles, where, in the usual form, the King held, what under the old government was called, a Bed of Justice; and the two edicts were enregistered in presence of the Parliament, by an order of State, in the manner mentioned in page 94. On this, the Parliament immedi∣ately returned to Paris, renewed their session in
<PB N="100" REF="102"/>
form, and ordered the enregistering to be struck out, declaring that every thing done at Ver∣sailles was illegal. All the members of the Parliament were then served with Lettres de Cachet, and exiled to Trois; but as they con∣tinued as inflexible in exile as before, and as vengeance did not supply the place of taxes, they were after a short time recalled to Paris.</P>
<P>The edicts were again tendered to them, and the Count D'Artois undertook to act as repre∣sentative of the King. For this purpose, he came from Versailles to Paris, in a train of pro∣cession; and the Parliament were assembled to receive him. But show and parade had lost their influence in France; and whatever ideas of im∣portance he might set off with, he had to return with those of mortification and disappointment. On alighting from his carriage to ascend the steps of the Parliament House, the crowd (which was numerously collected) threw out trite expressions, saying <Q>This is Monsieur D'Artois, who wants more of our money to spend.</Q> The marked disapprobation which he saw, impressed him with apprehensions; and the word <HI>Aux armes! (To arms!)</HI> was given out by the officer of the guard who attended him. It was so loudly vociferated, that it echoed through the avenues of the House, and produced a temporary confusion: I was then standing in one of the apartments through which he had to pass, and could not avoid re∣flecting
<PB N="101" REF="103"/>
how wretched was the condition of a disrespected man.</P>
<P>He endeavoured to impress the Parliament by great words, and opened his authority by saying, "The King, our Lord and Master." The Parliament received him very coolly, and with their usual determination not to register the taxes: and in this manner the interview ended.</P>
<P>After this a new subject took place: In the various debates and contests which arose between the Court and the Parliaments on the subject of taxes, the Parliament of Paris at last de∣clared, that although it had been customary for Parliaments to enregister edicts for taxes as a matter of convenience, the right belonged on∣ly to the <HI>States-General;</HI> and that, therefore, the Parliament could no longer with propriety continue to debate on what it had not authority to act. The King after this came to Paris, and held a meeting with the Parliament, in which he continued from ten in the morning till about six in the evening; and, in a manner that ap∣peared to proceed from him, as if unconsulted upon with the cabinet or the ministry, gave his word to the Parliament, that the States-General should be convened.</P>
<P>But after this another scene arose, on a ground different from all the former. The minister and the cabinet were averse to calling the States-General: They well knew, that if the States-General were assembled, themselves must
<PB N="102" REF="104"/>
fall; and as the King had not mentioned <HI>any time,</HI> they hit on a project calculated to elude, without appearing to oppose.</P>
<P>For this purpose, the Court set about making a sort of constitution itself: It was principally the work of M. Lamoignon, Keeper of the Seals, who afterwards shot himself. This new arrangement consisted in establishing a body un∣der the name of a <HI>Cour pléniere,</HI> or full Court, in which were invested all the powers that the government might have occasion to make use of. The persons composing this Court were to be nominated by the King; the contended right of taxation was given up on the part of the King, and a new criminal code of laws, and law proceedings, was substituted in the room of the former. The thing, in many points, contained better principles than those upon which the government had hitherto been ad∣ministered: but with respect to the <HI>Cour pléniere,</HI> it was no other than a medium through which despotism was to pass, without appearing to act directly from itself.</P>
<P>The Cabinet had high expectations from their new contrivance. The persons who were to compose the <HI>Cour pléniere,</HI> were already nomi∣nated; and as it was necessary to carry a fair appearance, many of the best characters in the the nation were appointed among the number. It was to commence on the 8th of May 1788: But an opposition arose to it, on two grounds— the one as to principle, the other as to form.</P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="105"/>On the ground of Principle it was contended, That government had not a right to alter itself; and that if the practice was once admitted, it would grow into a principle, and be made a precedent for any future alterations the govern∣ment might wish to establish: That the right of altering the government was a national right, and not a right of government.—And on the ground of Form, it was contended, That the <HI>Cour pléniere</HI> was nothing more than a larger Cabinet.</P>
<P>The then Duke de la Rochefoucault, Lux∣embourg, De Noailles, and many others, re∣fused to accept the nomination, and strenuously opposed the whole plan. When the edict for establishing this new Court was sent to the Parliaments to be enregistered, and put into execution, they resisted also. The Parliament of Paris not only refused, but denied the au∣thority; and the contest renewed itself between the Parliament and the Cabinet more strongly than ever. While the Parliament were sitting in debate on this subject, the Ministry ordered a regiment of soldiers to surround the House, and form a blockade. The Members sent out for beds and provision, and lived as in a besieged citadel: and as this had no effect, the com∣manding officer was ordered to enter the Parlia∣ment house and seize them; which he did, and some of the principal members were shut up in different prisons. About the same time a de∣putation of persons arrived from the province
<PB N="104" REF="106"/>
of Brittany, to remonstrate against the establish∣ment of the <HI>Cour pléniere;</HI> and those the Arch∣bishop sent to the Bastille. But the spirit of the Nation was not to be overcome; and it was so ful∣ly sensible of the strong ground it had taken, that of withholding taxes, that it contented itself with keeping up a sort of quiet resistance, which effectually overthrew all the plans at that time formed against it. The project of the <HI>Cour plé∣niere</HI> was at last obliged to be given up, and the Prime Minister not long afterwards followed its fate; and M. Neckar was recalled into office.</P>
<P>The attempt to establish the <HI>Cour pléniere</HI> had an effect upon the Nation which itself did not perceive. It was a sort of new form of govern∣ment, that insensibly served to put the old one out of sight, and to unhinge it from the super∣stitious authority of antiquity. It was govern∣ment dethroning government; and the old one, by attempting to make a new one, made a chasm.</P>
<P>The failure of this scheme renewed the subject of convening the States-General; and this gave rise to a new series of politics. There was no settled form for convening the States-General: all that it positively meant, was a deputation from what was then called the Clergy, the Noblesse, and the Commons; but their num∣bers, or their proportions, had not been always the same. They had been convened only on extraordinary occasions, the last of which was
<PB N="105" REF="107"/>
in 1614; their numbers were then in equal proportions, and they voted by orders.</P>
<P>It could not well escape the sagacity of M. Neckar, that the mode of 1614 would answer neither the purpose of the then government, nor of the nation. As matters were at that time circumstanced, it would have been too contentious to agree upon any thing. The de∣bates would have been endless upon privileges and exemptions, in which neither the wants of the government, nor the wishes of the nation for a constitution, would have been attended to. But as he did not chuse to take the decision upon himself, he summoned again the <HI>Assembly of the Notables,</HI> and referred it to them. This body was in general interested in the decision, being chiefly of the aristocracy and the high-paid clergy; and they decided in favour of the mode of 1614. This decision was against the sense of the Nation, and also against the wishes of the Court; for the aristocracy opposed itself to both, and contended for privileges inde∣pendent of either. The subject was then taken up by the Parliament, who recommended, that the number of the Commons should be equal to the other two; and that they should all sit in one house, and vote in one body. The num∣ber finally determined on was twelve hundred: six hundred to be chosen by the Commons, (and this was less than their proportion ought to have been when their worth and consequence is con∣sidered on a national scale), three hundred by
<PB N="106" REF="108"/>
the Clergy, and three hundred by the Aristo∣cracy; but with respect to the mode of assem∣bling themselves, whether together or apart, or the manner in which they should vote, those matters were referred <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Burke, (and I must take the liberty of telling him he is very unacquainted with French affairs), speaking upon this subject, says, <Q>The first thing that struck me in the calling the States-General, was a great departure from the ancient course;</Q>— and he soon after says, <Q>From the moment I read the list, I saw distinctly, and very nearly as it has happened, all that was to follow.</Q>—Mr. Burke certainly did not see all that was to follow. I endeavoured to impress him, as well before as after the States-General met, that there would be a <HI>revolution;</HI> but was not able to make him see it, neither would he believe it. How then he could distinctly see all the parts, when the whole was out of sight, is beyond my comprehension. And with respect to the "departure from the ancient course," besides the natural weak∣ness of the remark, it shews that he is unacquainted with circum∣stances. The departure was necessary, from the experience had upon it, that the ancient course was a bad one. The States-General of 1614 were called at the commencement of the civil war in the minority of Louis XIII; but by the clash of arranging them by orders, they increased the confusion they were called to compose. The Author of <HI>L'Intrigue du Cabinet</HI> (Intrigue of the Cabinet), who wrote before any revolution was thought of in France, speaking of the States-General of 1614, says, <Q>They held the public in suspense five months; and by the questions agitated therein, and the heat with which they were put, it appears that the Great <HI>(les grands)</HI> thought more to satisfy their <HI>par∣ticular</HI> passions, than to procure the good of the nation; and the whole time passed away in altercations, ceremonies, and parade.</Q> L'Intrigue du Cabinet, vol. i. p. 329.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The election that followed, was not a con∣tested election, but an animated one. The candidates were not men, but principles. So∣cieties were formed in Paris, and committees of

correspondence and communication establish∣ed throughout the nation, for the purpose of enlightening the people, and explaining to them the principles of civil government; and so or∣derly was the election conducted, that it did not give rise even to the rumour of tumult.</P>
<P>The States-General were to meet at Ver∣sailles in April 1789, but did not assemble till May. They situated themselves in three sepa∣rate chambers, or rather the Clergy and the Aristocracy withdrew each into a separate cham∣ber. The majority of the aristocracy claimed what they called the privilege of voting as a separate body, and of giving their consent or their negative in that manner; and many of the bishops and the high-beneficed clergy claimed the same privilege on the part of their Order.</P>
<P>The <HI>Tiers Etat</HI> (as they were then called) disowned any knowledge of artificial Orders and artificial privileges; and they were not only re∣solute on this point, but somewhat disdainful. They began to consider aristocracy as a kind of fungus growing out of the corruption of society, that could not be admitted even as a branch of it; and from the disposition the aristocracy had shewn by upholding Lettres de Cachet, and in sundry other instances, it was manifest that no constitution could be formed by admitting men in any other character than as National Men.</P>
<P>After various altercations on this head, the Tiers Etat or Commons (as they were then called) declared themselves (on a motion made
<PB N="108" REF="110"/>
for that purpose by the Abbé Sieyes) "THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE NATION; <HI>and that</HI>
<Q>the two Orders could be considered but as depu∣ties of corporations, and could only have a de∣liberative voice when they assembled in a national character with the national representa∣tives.</Q> This proceeding extinguished the stile of <HI>Etats Généraux,</HI> or States-General, and erected it into the stile it now bears, that of L'Assemble Nationale, or National Assembly.</P>
<P>This motion was not made in a precipitate manner: It was the result of cool deliberation, and concerted between the national represen∣tatives and the patriotic members of the two chambers, who saw into the folly, mischief, and injustice of artificial privileged distinctions. It was become evident, that no constitution, wor∣thy of being called by that name, could be established on any thing less than a national ground. The aristocracy had hitherto opposed the despotism of the Court, and affected the language of patriotism; but it opposed it as its rival (as the English Barons opposed King John), and it now opposed the nation from the same motives.</P>
<P>On carrying this motion, the national repre∣sentatives, as had been concerted, sent an invi∣tation to the two chambers, to unite with them in a national character, and proceed to business. A majority of the clergy, chiefly of the parish priests, withdrew from the clerical chamber, and joined the nation; and forty-five from the
<PB N="109" REF="111"/>
other chamber joined in like manner. There is a sort of secret history belonging to this last circumstance, which is necessary to its explana∣tion: It was not judged prudent that all the pa∣triotic members of the chamber stiling itself the Nobles, should quit it at once; and in con∣sequence of this arrangement, they drew off by degrees, always leaving some, as well to reason the case, as to watch the suspected. In a little time, the numbers increased from forty-five to eighty, and soon after to a greater number; which, with a majority of the clergy, and the whole of the national representatives, put the mal-contents in a very diminutive condition.</P>
<P>The King, who, very different from the gene∣ral class called by that name, is a man of a good heart, shewed himself disposed to recommend an union of the three chambers, on the ground the National Assembly had taken; but the mal-contents exerted themselves to prevent it, and began now to have another project in view. Their numbers consisted of a majority of the aristocratical chamber, and a minority of the clerical chamber, chiefly of bishops and high-beneficed clergy; and these men were deter∣mined to put every thing to issue, as well by strength as by stratagem. They had no ob∣jection to a constitution; but it must be such a one as themselves should dictate, and suited to their own views and particular situations. On the other hand, the Nation disowned know∣ing any thing of them but as citizens, and was
<PB N="110" REF="112"/>
determined to shut out all such up-start preten∣sions. The more aristocracy appeared, the more it was despised; there was a visible imbecillity and want of intellects in the majority, a sort of <HI>je ne sais quoi,</HI> that while it affected to be more than citizen, was less than man. It lost ground from contempt more than from hatred; and was rather jeered at as an ass, than dreaded as a lion. This is the general character of aristo∣cracy, or what are called Nobles or Nobility, or rather No-ability, in all countries.</P>
<P>The plan of the mal contents consisted now of two things; either to deliberate and vote by chambers, (or orders), more especially on all questions respecting a constitution, (by which the aristocratical chamber would have had a ne∣gative on any article of the constitution); or, in case they could not accomplish this object, to overthrow the National Assembly entirely.</P>
<P>To effect one or other of these objects, they began now to cultivate a friendship with the despotism they had hitherto attempted to rival, and the Count D'Artois became their chief. The King (who has since declared himself de∣ceived into their measures) held, according to the old form, <HI>a Bed of Justice,</HI> in which he ac∣corded to the deliberation and vote <HI>par tete</HI> (by head) upon several subjects; but reserved the deliberation and vote upon all questions re∣specting a constitution, to the three chambers separately. This declaration of the King was made against the advice of M. Neckar, who
<PB N="111" REF="113"/>
now began to perceive that he was growing out of fashion at Court, and that another mini∣nister was in contemplation.</P>
<P>As the form of sitting in separate chambers was yet apparently kept up, though essentially destroyed, the national representatives, imme∣diately after this declaration of the King, re∣sorted to their own chambers to consult on a protest against it; and the minority of the chamber (calling itself the Nobles), who had joined the national cause, retired to a private house to consult in like manner. The mal∣contents had by this time concerted their mea∣sures with the Court, which Count D'Artois undertook to conduct; and as they saw from the discontent which the declaration excited, and the opposition making against it, that they could not obtain a controul over the intended constitution by a separate vote, they prepared themselves for their final object—that of con∣spiring against the National Assembly, and overthrowing it.</P>
<P>The next morning, the door of the chamber of the National Assembly was shut against them, and guarded by troops; and the Mem∣bers were refused admittance. On this, they withdrew to a tennis-ground in the neighbour∣hood of Versailles, as the most convenient place they could find, and, after renewing their session, took an oath never to separate from each other, under any circumstance whatever, death excepted, until they had established a
<PB N="112" REF="114"/>
constitution. As the experiment of shutting up the house had no other effect than that of pro∣ducing a closer connection in the Members, it was opened again the next day, and the pub∣lic business recommenced in the usual place.</P>
<P>We now are to have in view the forming of the new Ministry, which was to accomplish the overthrow of the National Assembly. But as force would be necessary, orders were issued to assemble thirty thousand troops, the command of which was given to Broglio, one of the new-intended Ministry, who was recalled from the country for this purpose. But as some manage∣ment was necessary to keep this plan concealed till the moment it should be ready for execution, it is to this policy that a declaration made by Count D'Artois must be attributed, and which is here proper to be introduced.</P>
<P>It could not but occur, that while the mal∣contents continued to resort to their chambers separate from the National Assembly, that more jealousy would be excited than if they were mixed with it, and that the plot might be sus∣pected. But as they had taken their ground, and now wanted a pretence for quitting it, it was necessary that one should be devised. This was effectually accomplished by a declaration made by Count D'Artois, <Q>That if they took not a part in the National Assembly, the life of the King would be endangered:</Q> on which they quitted their chambers, and mixed with the Assembly in one body.</P>
<P><PB N="113" REF="115"/>At the time this declaration was made, it was generally treated as a piece of absurdity in Count D'Artois, and calculated merely to re∣lieve the outstanding Members of the two chambers from the diminutive situation they were put in; and if nothing more had followed, this conclusion would have been good. But as things best explain themselves by their events, this apparent union was only a cover to the machi∣nations which were secretly going on; and the declaration accommodated itself to answer that purpose. In a little time the National Assembly found itself surrounded by troops, and thousands more were daily arriving. On this a very strong declaration was made by the National Assembly to the King, remonstrating on the impropriety of the measure, and demanding the reason. The King, who was not in the secret of this business, as himself afterwards declared, gave substantially for answer, that he had no other object in view than to preserve the public tranquillity, which appeared to be much dis∣turbed.</P>
<P>But in a few days from this time, the plot unravelled itself. M. Neckar and the Ministry were displaced, and a new one formed, of the enemies of the Revolution; and Broglio, with between twenty-five and thirty thousand foreign troops, was arrived to support them. The mask was now thrown off, and matters were come to a crisis. The event was, that in the
<PB N="114" REF="116"/>
space of three days, the new Ministry and their abettors found it prudent to fly the nation; the Bastille was taken, and Broglio and his foreign troops dispersed; as is already related in the former part of this work.</P>
<P>There are some curious circumstances in the history of this short-lived ministry, and this short-lived attempt at a counter-revolution. The palace of Versailles, where the Court was sitting, was not more than four hundred yards distant from the hall where the National Assem∣bly was sitting. The two places were at this moment like the separate head-quarters of two combatant armies; yet the Court was as perfectly ignorant of the information which had arrived from Paris to the National Assembly, as if it had resided at an hundred miles distance. The then Marquis de la Fayette, who (as has been already mentioned) was chosen to pre∣side in the National Assembly on this particu∣lar occasion, named, by order of the Assembly, three successive deputations to the King, on the day, and up to the evening on which the Bastille was taken, to inform and confer with him on the state of affairs: but the ministry, who knew not so much as that it was attacked, pre∣cluded all communication, and were solacing themselves how dextrously they had succeeded; but in a few hours the accounts arrived so thick and fast, that they had to start from their desks and run. Some set off in one disguise, and some
<PB N="115" REF="117"/>
in another, and none in their own character. Their anxiety now was to outride the news lest they should be stopt, which, though it flew fast, flew not so fast as themselves.</P>
<P>It is worth remarking, that the National As∣sembly neither pursued those fugitive conspira∣tors, nor took any notice of them, nor sought to retaliate in any shape whatever. Occupied with establishing a constitution founded on the Rights of Man and the Authority of the People, the only authority on which Government has a right to exist in any country, the National As∣sembly felt none of those mean passions which mark the character of impertinent governments, founding themselves on their own authority, or on the absurdity of hereditary succession. It is the faculty of the human mind to become what it contemplates, and to act in unison with its object.</P>
<P>The conspiracy being thus dispersed, one of the first works of the National Assembly, instead of vindictive proclamations, as has been the case with other governments, published a Declaration of the Rights of Man, as the basis on which the new constitution was to be built, and which is here subjoined:</P>

<DIV1 TYPE="declaration">
<HEAD>DECLARATION OF THE RIGHTS OF MAN AND OF CITIZENS, <HI>By the National Assembly of France.</HI></HEAD>
<P>"THE Representatives of the people of FRANCE, formed into a NATIONAL ASSEMBLY, considering that ignorance, neglect, or contempt of human rights, are the sole causes of public misfortunes and corruptions of Government, have resolved to set forth, in a solemn declara∣tion, these natural, imprescriptible, and unalie∣nable rights: that this declaration being con∣stantly present to the minds of the members of the body social, they may be ever kept attentive to their rights and their duties: that the acts of the legislative and executive powers of Govern∣ment, being capable of being every moment compared with the end of political institutions, may be more respected: and also, that the future claims of the citizens, being directed by simple and incontestible principles, may always tend to the maintenance of the Constitution, and the general happiness.</P>
<P>"For these reasons, the NATIONAL ASSEMBLY doth recognize and declare, in the presence of the Supreme Being, and with the hope of his blessing and favour, the following <HI>sacred</HI> rights of men and of citizens:</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="117" REF="119"/><Q><HI>I.</HI> Men are born, and always continue, free, and equal in respect of their rights. Civil dis∣tinctions, therefore, can be founded only on public utility.</Q></P>
<P N="2"><Q><HI>II.</HI> The end of all political associations, is, the preservation of the natural and imprescriptible rights of man; and these rights are liberty, pro∣perty, security, and resistance of oppression.</Q></P>
<P N="3"><Q><HI>III.</HI> The nation is essentially the source of all sovereignty; nor can any <HI>INDIVIDUAL,</HI> or <HI>ANY BODY OF MEN,</HI> be entitled to any authority which is not expressly derived from it.</Q></P>
<P N="4"><Q>IV. Political Liberty consists in the power of doing whatever does not injure another. The exercise of the natural rights of every man, has no other limits than those which are necessary to secure to every <HI>other</HI> man the free exercise of the same rights; and these limits are determinable only by the law.</Q></P>
<P N="5"><Q>V. The law ought to prohibit only actions hurtful to society. What is not prohibited by the law, should not be hindered; nor should any one be compelled to that which the law does not require.</Q></P>
<P N="6"><Q>VI. The law is an expression of the will of the community. All citizens have a right to concur, either personally, or by their repre∣sentatives, in its formation. It should be the same to all, whether it protects or punishes; and <HI>all being equal in its sight, are equally eli∣gible to all honours, places, and employments,
<PB N="118" REF="120"/>
according to their different abilities, without any other distinction than that created by their virtues and talents.</HI></Q></P>
<P N="7"><Q>VII. No man should be accused, arrested, or held in confinement, except in cases deter∣mined by the law, and according to the forms which it has prescribed. All who promote, solicit, execute, or cause to be executed, arbitrary orders, ought to be punished; and every citizen called upon, or apprehended by virtue of the law, ought immediately to obey, and renders himself culpable by resistance.</Q></P>
<P N="8"><Q>VIII. The law ought to impose no other penalties but such as are absolutely and evi∣dently necessary: and no one ought to be pu∣nished, but in virtue of a law promulgated before the offence, and legally applied.</Q></P>
<P N="9"><Q>IX. Every man being presumed innocent till he has been convicted, whenever his de∣tention becomes indispensible, all rigour to him, more than is necessary to secure his per∣son, ought to be provided against by the law.</Q></P>
<P N="10"><Q>X. No man ought to be molested on account of his opinions, not even on account of his <HI>re∣ligious</HI> opinions, provided his avowal of them does not disturb the public order established by the law.</Q></P>
<P N="11"><Q>XI. The unrestrained communication of thoughts and opinions being one of the most precious rights of man, every citizen may speak, write, and publish freely, provided he
<PB N="119" REF="121"/>
is responsible for the abuse of this liberty in cases determined by the law.</Q></P>
<P N="12"><Q>XII. A public force being necessary to give security to the rights of men and of citi∣zens, that force is instituted for the benefit of the community, and not for the particular benefit of the persons with whom it is en∣trusted.</Q></P>
<P N="13"><Q>XIII. A common contribution being ne∣cessary for the support of the public force, and for defraying the other expences of go∣vernment, it ought to be divided equally among the members of the community, ac∣cording to their abilities.</Q></P>
<P N="14"><Q>XIV. Every citizen has a right, either by himself or his representative, to a free voice in determining the necessity of public contri∣butions, the appropriation of them, and their amount, mode of assessment, and duration.</Q></P>
<P N="15"><Q>XV. Every community has a right to de∣mand of all its agents, an account of their conduct.</Q></P>
<P N="16"><Q>XVI. Every community in which a sepa∣ration of powers and a security of rights is not provided for, wants a constitution.</Q></P>
<P N="17"><Q>XVII. The right to property being invio∣lable and sacred, no one ought to be deprived of it, except in cases of evident public neces∣sity, legally ascertained, and on condition of a previous just indemnity.</Q></P>

<HEAD>OSBERVATIONS ON THE DECLARATION OF RIGHTS.</HEAD>
<P>THE three first articles comprehend in gene∣ral terms, the whole of a Declaration of Rights: All the succeeding articles either originate from them, or follow as elucidations. The 4th, 5th, and 6th, define more particularly what is only generally expressed in the 1st, 2d, and 3d.</P>
<P>The 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, and 11th articles, are declaratory of <HI>principles</HI> upon which laws shall be constructed, conformable to <HI>rights</HI> al∣ready declared. But it is questioned by some very good people in France, as well as in other countries, whether the 10th article sufficiently guarantees the right it is intended to accord with: besides which, it takes off from the di∣vine dignity of religion, and weakens its opera∣tive force upon the mind, to make it a subject of human laws. It then presents itself to Man, like light intercepted by a cloudy medium, in which the source of it is obscured from his sight, and he sees nothing to reverence in the dusky ray <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There is a single idea, which, if it strikes rightly upon the mind either in a legal or a religious sense, will prevent any man, or any body of men, or any government, from going wrong on the subject of Religion; which is, that before any human institu∣tions of government was known in the world, there existed, if I may so express it, a compact between God and Man, from the be∣ginning of time; and that as the relation and condition which man in his <HI>individual person</HI> stands in towards his Maker, cannot be changed, or any-ways altered by any human laws or human authority, that religious devotion, which is a part of this com∣pact, cannot so much as be made a subject of human laws; and that all laws must conform themselves to this prior existing com∣pact, and not assume to make the compact conform to the laws, which, besides being human, are subsequent thereto. The first act of man, when he looked around and saw himself a creature which he did not make, and a world furnished for his reception, must have been devotion, and devotion must ever continue sacred to every individual man, <HI>as it appears right to him;</HI> and govern∣ments do mischief by interfering.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="123"/>The remaining articles, beginning with the twelfth, are substantially contained in the prin∣ciples of the preceding articles; but, in the particular situation which France then was, having to undo what was wrong, as well as to set up what was right, it was proper to be more particular than what in another condition of things would be necessary.</P>
<P>While the Declaration of Rights was before the National Assembly, some of its members remarked, that if a Declaration of Rights was published, it should be accompanied by a De∣claration of Duties. The observation discovered a mind that reflected, and it only erred by not reflecting far enough. A Declaration of Rights is, by reciprocity, a Declaration of Duties also. Whatever is my right as a man, is also the right of another; and it becomes my duty to guarantee, as well as to possess.</P>
<P><PB N="122" REF="124"/>The three first articles are the basis of Liber∣ty, as well individual as national; nor can any country be called free, whose government does not take its beginning from the principles they contain, and continue to preserve them pure; and the whole of the Declaration of Rights is of more value to the world, and will do more good, than all the laws and statutes that have yet been promulgated.</P>
<P>In the declaratory exordium which prefaces the Declaration of Rights, we see the solemn and majestic spectacle of a Nation opening its commission, under the auspices of its Creator, to establish a Government; a scene so new, and so transcendantly unequalled by any-thing in the European world, that the name of a Revo∣lution is diminutive of its character, and it rises into a Regeneration of man. What are the present Governments of Europe, but a scene of iniquity and oppression? What is that of England? Do not its own inhabitants say, It is a market where every man has his price, and where corruption is common traffic, at the expence of a deluded people? No wonder, then, that the French Revolution is traduced. Had it confined itself merely to the destruction of flagrant despotism, perhaps Mr. Burke and some others had been silent. Their cry now is, "It is gone too far:" that is, it has gone too far for them. It stares corruption in the face, and the venal tribe are all alarmed. Their fear
<PB N="123" REF="125"/>
discovers itself in their outrage, and they are but publishing the groans of a wounded vice. But from such opposition, the French Revolu∣tion, instead of suffering, receives an homage. The more it is struck, the more sparks it will emit; and the fear is, it will not be struck enough. It has nothing to dread from attacks: Truth has given it an establishment; and Time will record it with a name as lasting as his own.</P>
<P>Having now traced the progress of the French Revolution through most of its principal sta∣ges, from its commencement, to the taking of the Bastille, and its establishment by the Decla∣ration of Rights, I will close the subject with the energetic apostrophe of M. de la Fayette— <HI>May this great monument raised to Liberty, serve as a lesson to the oppressor, and an example to the oppressed!</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See page 18 of this work.—N. B. Since the taking of the Bastille, the occurrences have been published: but the matters recorded in this narrative, are prior to that period; and some of them, as may be easily seen, can be but very little known.</NOTE></P>

<HEAD>MISCELLANEOUS CHAPTER.</HEAD>
<P>TO prevent interrupting the argument in the preceding part of this work, or the narrative that follows it, I reserved some observa∣tions to be thrown together into a Miscella∣neous Chapter; by which variety might not be censured for confusion. Mr. Burke's Book is <HI>all</HI> Miscellany. His intention was to make an attack on the French Revolution; but instead of proceeding with an orderly arrangement, he has stormed it with a mob of ideas tumbling over and destroying one another.</P>
<P>But this confusion and contradiction in Mr. Burke's Book is easily accounted for.—When a man in a long cause attempts to steer his course by any thing else than some polar truth or principle, he is sure to be lost. It is beyond the compass of his capacity to keep all the parts of an argument together, and make them unite in one issue, by any other means than having this guide always in view. Neither memory nor invention will supply the want of it. The for∣mer fails him, and the latter betrays him.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding the nonsense, for it de∣serves no better name, that Mr. Burke has as∣serted about hereditary rights, and hereditary succession, and that a Nation has not a right to form a Government for itself; it happened to fall in his way to give some account of what
<PB N="125" REF="127"/>
Government is. <Q>Government, <HI>says he,</HI> is a contrivance of human wisdom.</Q></P>
<P>Admitting that Government is a contrivance of human <HI>wisdom,</HI> it must necessarily follow, that hereditary succession, and hereditary rights, (as they are called), can make no part of it, because it is impossible to make wisdom heredi∣tary; and on the other hand, <HI>that</HI> cannot be a wise contrivance, which in its operation may commit the government of a nation to the wis∣dom of an ideot. The ground which Mr. Burke now takes, is fatal to every part of his cause. The argument changes from hereditary rights to hereditary wisdom; and the question is, Who is the wisest man? He must now shew that every one in the line of hereditary succession was a Solomon, or his title is not good to be a king.—What a stroke has Mr. Burke now made! To use a sailors phrase, he has <HI>swabbed the deck,</HI> and scarcely left a name legible in the list of kings; and he has mowed down and thinned the House of Peers, with a scythe as formidable as Death and Time.</P>
<P>But Mr. Burke appears to have been aware of this retort; and he has taken care to guard against it, by making government to be not only a <HI>contrivance</HI> of human wisdom, but a <HI>mo∣nopoly</HI> of wisdom. He puts the nation as fools on one side, and places his government of wisdom, all wise men of Gotham, on the other side; and he then proclaims, and says, that <Q>Men have a <HI>RIGHT</HI> that their <HI>WANTS</HI> should
<PB N="126" REF="128"/>
be provided for by this wisdom.</Q> Having thus made proclamation, he next proceeds to explain to them what their <HI>wants</HI> are, and also what their <HI>rights</HI> are. In this he has succeeded dextrously, for he makes their wants to be a <HI>want</HI> of wisdom; but as this is but cold com∣fort, he then informs them, that they have a <HI>right</HI> (not to any of the wisdom) but to be go∣verned by it: and in order to impress them with a solemn reverence for this monopoly-government of wisdom, and of its vast capacity for all purposes, possible or impossible, right or wrong, he proceeds with astrological mysteri∣ous importance, to tell to them its powers, in these words—<Q>The Rights of men in govern∣ment are their advantages; and these are often in balances between differences of good; and in compromises sometimes be∣tween <HI>good</HI> and <HI>evil,</HI> and sometimes between <HI>evil</HI> and <HI>evil</HI> Political reason is a <HI>computing principle;</HI> adding—subtracting—multiplying —and dividing, morally, and not metaphy∣sically or mathematically, true moral demon∣strations.</Q></P>
<P>As the wondering audience, whom Mr. Burke supposes himself talking to, may not under∣stand all this learned jargon, I will undertake to be its interpreter. The meaning then, good people, of all this, is, <HI>That government is govern∣ed by no principle whatever; that it can make evil good, or good evil, just as it pleases. In short, that government is arbitrary power.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="129"/>But there are some things which Mr. Burke has forgotten. <HI>First,</HI> He has not shewn where the wisdom originally came from: and <HI>secondly,</HI> he has not shewn by what authority it first began to act. In the manner he introduces the matter, it is either government stealing wisdom, or wisdom stealing government. It is without an origin, and its powers without authority. In short, it is usurpation.</P>
<P>Whether it be from a sense of shame, or from a consciousness of some radical defect in a government necessary to be kept out of sight, or from both, or from any other cause, I under∣take not to determine; but so it is, that a monarchical reasoner never traces government to its source, or from its source. It is one of the <HI>shibboleths</HI> by which he may be known. A a thousand years hence, those who shall live in America or in France, will look back with contemplative pride on the origin of their go∣vernments, and say, <HI>This was the work of our glorious ancestors!</HI> But what can a monarchical talker say? What has he to exult in? Alas! he has nothing. A certain something forbids him to look back to a beginning, lest some robber or some Robin Hood should rise from the long obscurity of time, and say, <HI>I am the origin!</HI> Hard as Mr. Burke laboured the Regency Bill and hereditary succession two years ago, and much as he dived for precedents, he still had not boldness enough to bring up William of Normandy, and say, <HI>There is the head of the
<PB N="128" REF="130"/>
list! there is the fountain of honour!</HI> the son of a prostitutc, and the plunderer of the English nation.</P>
<P>The opinions of men with respect to govern∣ment, are changing fast in all countries. The revolutions of America and France have thrown a beam of light over the world, which reaches into man. The enormous expence of govern∣ments have provoked people to think, by mak∣ing them feel: and when once the veil begins to rend, it admits not of repair. Ignorance is of a peculiar nature: once dispelled, and it is impossible to re-establish it. It is not originally a thing of itself, but is only the absence of knowledge; and though man may be <HI>kept</HI> igno∣rant, he cannot be <HI>made</HI> ignorant. The mind, in discovering truth, acts in the same manner as it acts through the eye in discovering objects; when once any object has been seen, it is impossi∣ble to put the mind back to the same condition it was in before it saw it. Those who talk of a counter revolution in France, shew how little they under∣stand of man. There does not exist in the com∣pass of language, an arrangement of words to express so much as the means of effecting a counter revolution. The means must be an obliteration of knowledge; and it has never yet been discovered, how to make man <HI>unknow</HI> his knowledge, or <HI>unthink</HI> his thoughts.</P>
<P>Mr Burke is labouring in vain to stop the pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gress of knowledge; and it comes with the worse grace from him, as there is a certain trans∣action
<PB N="129" REF="131"/>
known in the city, which renders him suspected of being a pensioner in a fictitious name. This may account for some strange doctrine he has advanced in his book, which, though he points it at the Revolution Society, is effectually directed against the whole Nation.</P>
<P>"The King of England," says he, <Q>holds <HI>his</HI> Crown (for it does not belong to the Nation, according to Mr. Burke) in <HI>contempt</HI> of the choice of the Revolution Society, who have not a single vote for a King among them either <HI>individually</HI> or <HI>collectively;</HI> and his Majesty's heirs, each in their time and order, will come to the Crown <HI>with the same con∣tempt</HI> of their choice, with which his Majesty has succeeded to that which he now wears.</Q></P>
<P>As to who is King in England or elsewhere, or whether there is any King at all, or whether the people chuse a Cherokee Chief, or a Hessian Hussar for a King, it is not a matter that I trouble myself about—be that to themselves; but with respect to the doctrine, so far as it re∣lates to the Rights of Men and Nations, it is as abominable as any thing ever uttered in the most enslaved country under heaven. Whether it sounds worse to my ear, by not being accus∣tomed to hear such despotism, than what it does to the ear of another person, I am not so well a judge of; but of its abominable principle I am at no loss to judge.</P>
<P>It is not the Revolution Society that Mr. Burke means; it is the Nation, as well in its
<PB N="130" REF="132"/>
<HI>original,</HI> as in its <HI>representative</HI> character; and he has taken care to make himself understood, by saying that they have not a vote either <HI>col∣lectively</HI> or <HI>individually.</HI> The Revolution So∣ciety is composed of citizens of all denomina∣tions, and of members of both the Houses of Parliament; and consequently, if there is not a right to a vote in any of the characters, there can be no right to any, either in the nation, or in its parliament. This ought to be a caution to every country, how it imports foreign families to be kings. It is somewhat curious to observe, that although the people of England have been in the habit of talking about kings, it is always a Foreign House of kings; hating Foreigners, yet governed by them.—It is now the House of Brunswick, one of the petty tribes of Germany.</P>
<P>It has hitherto been the practice of the English Parliaments, to regulate what was called the suc∣cession, (taking it for granted, that the Nation then continued to accord to the form of annex∣ing a monarchical branch to its government; for without this, the Parliament could not have had authority to have sent either to Holland or to Hanover, or to impose a King upon the Na∣tion against its will.) And this must be the ut∣most limit to which Parliament can go upon the case; but the right of the Nation goes to the <HI>whole</HI> case, because it has the right of changing its <HI>whole</HI> form of government. The right of a Parliament is only a right in trust, a right by delegation, and that but from a very small part
<PB N="131" REF="133"/>
of the Nation; and one of its Houses has not even this. But the right of the Nation is an original right, as universal as taxation. The Nation is the paymaster of every thing, and every thing must conform to its general will.</P>
<P>I remember taking notice of a speech in what is called the English House of Peers, by the then Earl of Shelburne, and I think it was at the time he was Minister, which is applicable to this case. I do not directly charge my memory with every particular; but the words and the purport, as nearly as I remember, were these: <HI>That the form of a Government was a matter wholly at the will of a Nation, at all times: that if it chose a monarchi∣cal form, it had a right to have it so; and if it afterwards chose to be a Republic, it had a right to be a Republic, and to say to a King, 'We have no longer any occasion for you.'</HI></P>
<P>When Mr. Burke says that <Q>His Majesty's heirs and successors, each in their time and order, will come to the crown with the <HI>same contempt</HI> of their choice with which His Ma∣jesty has succeeded to that he wears,</Q> it is saying too much even to the humblest individual in the country; part of whose daily labour goes towards making up the million sterling a year, which the country gives the person it stiles a King. Government with insolence, is despotism; but when contempt is added, it becomes worse; and to pay for contempt, is the excess of slavery. This species of Government comes from Ger∣many; and reminds me of what one of the
<PB N="132" REF="134"/>
Brunswick soldiers told me, who was taken pri∣soner by the Americans in the late war: "Ah!" said he, <Q>America is a fine free country, it is worth the people's fighting for; I know the difference by knowing my own: in my coun∣try, if the prince says, Eat straw, we eat straw.</Q> God help that country, thought I, be it Eng∣land or elsewhere, whose liberties are to be pro∣tected by German principles of government, and Princes of Brunswick!</P>
<P>As Mr. Burke sometimes speaks of England, sometimes of France, and sometimes of the world, and of government in general, it is difficult to answer his book without apparently meeting him on the same ground. Although principles of Government are general subjects, it is next to impossible in many cases to separate them from the idea of place and circumstance; and the more so when circumstances are put for arguments, which is frequently the case with Mr. Burke.</P>
<P>In the former part of his book, addressing himself to the people of France, he says, <Q>No experience has taught us, (meaning the Eng∣lish), that in any other course or method than that of an <HI>hereditary crown,</HI> can our liberties be regularly perpetuated and preserved sacred as our <HI>hereditary right.</HI></Q> I ask Mr. Burke, who is to take them away?—M. de la Fayette, in speaking to France, says, <Q>For a Nation to be free, it is sufficient that she wills it.</Q> But Mr. Burke represents England as wanting capa∣city to take care of itself, and that its liberties
<PB N="133" REF="135"/>
must be taken care of by a King holding it in "contempt." If England is sunk to this, it is preparing itself to eat straw, as in Hanover or in Brunswick. But besides the folly of the de∣claration, it happens that the facts are all against Mr. Burke. It was by the Government <HI>being hereditary,</HI> that the liberties of the people were endangered. Charles I. and James II. are in∣stances of this truth; yet neither of them went so far as to hold the Nation in contempt.</P>
<P>As it is sometimes of advantage to the people of one country, to hear what those of other countries have to say respecting it, it is possible that the people of France may learn something from Mr. Burke's book, and that the people of England may also learn something from the an∣swers it will occasion. When Nations fall out about freedom, a wide field of debate is opened. The argument commences with the rights of war. without its evils; and as knowledge is the object contended for, the party that sustains the defeat obtains the prize.</P>
<P>Mr. Burke talks about what he calls an here∣ditary crown, as if it were some production of Nature; or as if, like Time, it had a power to operate, not only independently, but in spite of man; or as if it were a thing or a subject uni∣versally consented to. Alas! it has none of those properties, but is the reverse of them all. It is a thing in imagination, the propriety of which is more than doubted, and the legality of which in a few years will be denied.</P>
<P><PB N="134" REF="136"/>But, to arrange this matter in a clearer view than what general expressions can convey, it will be necessary to state the distinct heads under which (what is called) an hereditary crown, or, more properly speaking, an hereditary succession to the Government of a Nation, can be consi∣dered; which are,</P>
<P>First, The right of a particular Family to establish itself.</P>
<P>Secondly, The right of a Nation to establish a particular Family.</P>
<P>With respect to the <HI>first</HI> of these heads, that of a Family establishing itself with hereditary powers on its own authority, and independent of the consent of a Nation, all men will concur in calling it despotism; and it would be trespass∣ing on their understanding to attempt to prove it.</P>
<P>But the <HI>second</HI> head, that of a Nation establish∣ing a particular Family with <HI>hereditary powers,</HI> does not present itself as despotism on the first reflection; but if men will permit a second re∣flection to take place, and carry that reflection forward but one remove out of their own per∣sons to that of their offspring, they will then see that hereditary succession becomes in its conse∣quences the same despotism to others, which they reprobated for themselves. It operates to preclude the consent of the succeeding genera∣tion; and the preclusion of consent is despotism. When the person who at any time shall be in possession of a Government, or those who stand in succession to him, shall say to a Nation, I
<PB N="135" REF="137"/>
hold this power in 'contempt' of you, it signifies not on what authority he pretends to say it. It is no relief, but an aggravation to a person in slavery, to reflect that he was sold by his parent; and as that which heightens the criminality of an act cannot be produced to prove the legality of it, hereditary succession cannot be established as a legal thing.</P>
<P>In order to arrive at a more perfect decision on this head, it will be proper to consider the gene∣ration which undertakes to establish a Family with <HI>hereditary powers,</HI> a-part and separate from the generations which are to follow; and also to con∣sider the character in which the <HI>first</HI> generation acts with respect to succeeding generations.</P>
<P>The generation which first selects a person, and puts him at the head of its Government, either with the title of King, or any other distinction, acts its <HI>own choice,</HI> be it wise or foolish, as a free agent for itself. The person so set up is not hereditary, but selected and appointed; and the generation who sets him up, does not live under an hereditary go∣vernment, but under a government of its own choice and establishment. Were the generation who sets him up, and the person so set up, to live for ever, it never could become hereditary succes∣sion; and of consequence, hereditary succession can only follow on the death of the first parties.</P>
<P>As therefore hereditary succession is out of the question with respect to the <HI>first</HI> generation, we have now to consider the character in which <HI>that</HI> generation acts with respect to the commencing generation, and to all succeeding ones.</P>
<P><PB N="136" REF="138"/>It assumes a character, to which it has neither right nor title. It changes itself from a <HI>Legislator</HI> to a <HI>Testator,</HI> and affects to make its Will, which is to have operation after the demise of the makers, to bequeath the Government; and it not only attempts to bequeath, but to establish on the suc∣ceeding generation, a new and different form of government under which itself lived. Itself, as is already observed, lived not under an hereditary Government, but under a Government of its own choice and establishment; and it now attempts, by virtue of a will and testament, (and which it has not authority to make), to take from the com∣mencing generation, and all future ones, the rights and free agency by which itself acted.</P>
<P>But, exclusive of the right which any generation has to act collectively as a testator, the objects to which it applies itself in this case, are not within the compass of any law, or of any will or testament.</P>
<P>The rights of men in society, are neither devise∣able, nor transferable, nor annihilable, but are descendable only; and it is not in the power of any generation to intercept finally, and cut off the descent. If the present generation, or any other, are disposed to be slaves, it does not lessen the right of the succeeding generation to be free: wrongs cannot have a legal descent. When Mr. Burke attempts to maintain, that the <HI>English Nation did at the Revolution of</HI> 1688, <HI>most solemnly renounce and abdicate their rights for themselves, and for all their posterity for ever;</HI> he speaks a language that merits not reply, and which can only excite contempt for his prostitute principles, or pity for his ignorance.</P>
<P><PB N="137" REF="139"/>In whatever light hereditary succession, as grow∣ing out of the will and testament of some former generation, presents itself, it is an absurdity. A cannot make a will to take from B the property of B, and give it to C; yet this is the manner in which (what is called) hereditary succession by law operates. A certain former generation made a will, to take away the rights of the commencing gene∣ration, and all future ones, and convey those rights to a third person, who afterwards comes forward, and tells them, in Mr. Burke's language, that they have <HI>no rights,</HI> that their rights are already be∣queathed to him, and that he will govern in <HI>con∣tempt</HI> of them. From such principles, and such ignorance, Good Lord deliver the world!</P>
<P>But, after all, what is this metaphor called a crown, or rather what is monarchy? Is it a thing, or is it a name, or is it a fraud? Is it "a contrivance of human wisdom," or of human craft to obtain money from a nation under spe∣cious pretences? Is it a thing necessary to a nation? If it is, in what does that necessity consist, what services does it perform, what is its business, and what are its merits? Doth the vir∣tue consist in the metaphor, or in the man? Doth the goldsmith that makes the crown, make the vir∣tue also? Doth it operate like Fortunatus's wish∣ing-cap, or Harlequin's wooden sword? Doth it make a man a conjuror? In fine, what is it? It appears to be a something going much out of fashion, falling into ridicule, and rejected in some countries both as unnecessary and expensive. In
<PB N="138" REF="140"/>
America it is considered as an absurdity; and in France it has so far declined, that the goodness of the man, and the respect for his personal cha∣racter, are the only things that preserve the ap∣pearance of its existence.</P>
<P>If Government be what Mr. Burke describes it, "a contrivance of human wisdom," I might ask him, if wisdom was at such a low ebb in Eng∣land, that it was become necessary to import it from Holland and from Hanover? But I will do the country the justice to say, that was not the case; and even if it was, it mistook the cargo. The wisdom of every country, when properly exerted, is sufficient for all its purposes; and there could exist no more real occasion in England to have sent for a Dutch Stadtholder, or a German Elector, than there was in America to have done a similar thing. If a country does not understand its own affairs, how is a foreigner to understand them, who knows neither its laws, its manners, nor its language? If there existed a man so transcen∣dantly wise above all others, that his wisdom was necessary to instruct a nation, some reason might be offered for monarchy; but when we cast our eyes about a country, and observe how every part understands its own affairs; and when we look around the world, and see that of all men in it, the race of kings are the most insignificant in capacity, our reason cannot fail to ask us—What are those men kept for?</P>
<P>If there is any thing in monarchy which we people of America do not understand, I wish Mr.
<PB N="139" REF="141"/>
Burke would be so kind as to inform us. I see in America, a government extending over a country ten times as large as England, and conducted with regularity, for a fortieth part of the expence which government costs in England. If I ask a man in America, if he wants a King? he retorts, and asks me if I take him for an ideot? How is it that this difference happens? are we more or less wise than others? I see in America, the generality of people living in a stile of plenty unknown in monarchical countries; and I see that the principle of its government, which is that of the <HI>equal Rights of Man,</HI> is making a rapid progress in the world.</P>
<P>If monarchy is a useless thing, why is it kept up anywhere? and if a necessary thing, how can it be dispensed with? That <HI>civil government</HI> is necessary, all civilized nations will agree; but civil government is republican government. All that part of the government of England which begins with the office of constable, and proceeds through the department of magistrate, quarter-session, and general assize, including trial by jury, is republican government. Nothing of monarchy appears in any part of it, except the name which William the Conqueror imposed upon the English, that of obliging them to call him "Their Sove∣reign Lord the King."</P>
<P>It is easy to conceive, that a band of interested men, such as Placemen, Pensioners, Lords of the bed-chamber, Lords of the kitchen, Lords of the necessary-house, and the Lord knows what besides, can find as many reasons for monarchy as their
<PB N="140" REF="142"/>
salaries, paid at the expence of the country, amount to; but if I ask the farmer, the manufac∣turer, the merchant, the tradesman, and down through all the occupations of life to the common labourer, what service monarchy is to him? he can give me no answer. If I ask him what mo∣narchy is, he believes it is something like a sinecure.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding the taxes of England amount to almost seventeen millions a-year, said to be for the expences of Government, it is still evident that the sense of the Nation is left to govern itself, and does govern itself by magistrates and juries, almost at its own charge, on republican principles, exclusive of the expence of taxes. The salaries of the Judges are almost the only charge that is paid out of the revenue. Considering that all the internal Government is executed by the people, the taxes of England ought to be the lightest of any nation in Europe; instead of which, they are the contrary. As this cannot be accounted for on the score of civil government, the subject necessa∣rily extends itself to the monarchical part.</P>
<P>When the people of England sent for George the First, (and it would puzzle a wiser man than Mr. Burke to discover for what he could be wanted, or what service he could render), they ought at least to have conditioned for the aban∣donment of Hanover. Besides the endless Ger∣man intrigues that must follow from a German Elector being King of England, there is a natural impossibility of uniting in the same person the principles of Freedom and the principles of
<PB N="141" REF="143"/>
Despotism, or, as it is usually called in England, Arbitrary Power. A German Elector is in his electorate a despot: How then could it be ex∣pected that he should be attached to principles of liberty in one country, while his interest in another was to be supported by despotism? The union cannot exist; and it might easily have been foreseen, that German Electors would make Ger∣man Kings, or, in Mr. Burke's words, would assume government with 'contempt.' The English have been in the habit of considering a King of England only in the character in which he appears to them: whereas the same person, while the connection lasts, has a home-seat in another coun∣try, the interest of which is different to their own, and the principles of the governments in opposition to each other—To such a person England will appear as a town-residence, and the Electorate as the estate. The English may wish, as I believe they do, success to the principles of Liberty in France, or in Germany; but a German Elector trembles for the fate of despotism in his electorate: and the Dutchy of Mecklenburgh, where the present Queen's family governs, is under the same wretched state of arbitrary power, and the people in slavish vassalage.</P>
<P>There never was a time when it became the English to watch continental intrigues more cir∣cumspectly than at the present moment, and to distinguish the politics of the Electorate from the politics of the Nation. The revolution of France has entirely changed the ground with respect to
<PB N="142" REF="144"/>
England and France, as nations: but the German despots, with Prussia at their head, are combin∣ing against Liberty; and the fondness of Mr. Pitt for office, and the interest which all his family-connections have obtained, do not give sufficient security against this intrigue.</P>
<P>As every thing which passes in the world be∣comes matter for history, I will now quit this sub∣ject, and take a concise review of the state of par∣ties and politics in England, as Mr. Burke has done in France.</P>
<P>Whether the present reign commenced with contempt, I leave to Mr. Burke: certain however it is, that it had strongly that appearance. The animosity of the English Nation, it is very well remembered, ran high; and, had the true principles of Liberty been as well understood then as they now promise to be, it is probable the Nation would not have patiently submitted to so much. George the First and Second were sensible of a rival in the remains of the Stuarts; and as they could not but consider themselves as standing on their good beha∣viour, they had prudence to keep their German principles of Government to themselves; but as the Stuart family wore away, the prudence be∣came less necessary.</P>
<P>The contest between rights, and what were cal∣led prerogatives, continued to heat the Nation till some time after the conclusion of the American War, when all at once it fell a calm—Execration exchanged itself for applause, and Court popularity sprung up like a mushroom in a night.</P>
<P><PB N="143" REF="145"/>To account for this sudden transition, it is pro∣per to observe, that there are two distinct species of popularity; the one excited by merit, the other by resentment. As the Nation had formed itself into two parties, and each was extolling the merits of its parliamentary champions for and against prerogative, nothing could operate to give a more general shock than an immediate coalition of the champions themselves. The partisans of each being thus suddenly left in the lurch, and mutually heated with disgust at the measure, felt no other relief than uniting in a common execration against both. A higher stimulus of resentment being thus excited, than what the contest on prerogatives had occasioned, the Nation quitted all former objects of rights and wrongs, and sought only that of gratification. The indignation at the Coalition, so effectually superseded the indignation against the Court, as to extinguish it; and without any change of principles on the part of the Court, the same people who had reprobated its despotism, united with it, to revenge themselves on the Coalition Parliament. The case was not, which they liked best,—but, which they hated most; and the least hated passed for love. The dissolution of the Coalition Parliament, as it afforded the means of gratifying the resentment of the Nation, could not fail to be popular; and from hence arose the popularity of the Court.</P>
<P>Transitions of this kind exhibit a Nation under the government of temper, instead of a fixed and steady principle; and having once committed itself,
<PB N="144" REF="146"/>
however rashly, it feels itself urged along to justify by continuance its first proceeding.— Measures which at other times it would censure, it now approves, and acts persuasion upon itself to suffocate its judgment.</P>
<P>On the return of a new Parliament, the new Minister, Mr. Pitt, found himself in a secure majority: and the nation gave him credit, not out of regard to himself, but because it had re∣solved to do it out of resentment to another. He introduced himself to public notice by a proposed Reform of Parliament, which in its operation would have amounted to a public justification of corruption. The Nation was to be at the expence of buying up the rotten boroughs, whereas it ought to punish the per∣sons who deal in the traffic.</P>
<P>Passing over the two bubbles, of the Dutch business, and the million a-year to sink the national debt, the matter which most presents itself, is the affair of the Regency. Never, in the course of my observation, was delusion more successfully acted nor a nation more com∣pletely deceived.—But, to make this appear, it will be necessary to go over the circumstances.</P>
<P>Mr. Fox had stated in the House of Com∣mons, that the Prince of Wales, as heir in suc∣cession, had a right in himself to assume the government. This was opposed by Mr. Pitt; and, so far as the opposition was confined to the doctrine, it was just. But the principles
<PB N="145" REF="147"/>
which Mr. Pitt maintained on the contrary side, were as bad, or worse in their extent, than those of Mr. Fox; because they went to establish an aristocracy over the Nation, and over the small <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>presentation it has in the House of Commons.</P>
<P>Whether the English form of Government be good or bad, is not in this case the question; but, taking it as it stands, without regard to its merits or demerits, Mr. Pitt was farther from the point than Mr. Fox.</P>
<P>It is supposed to consist of three parts:— while therefore the Nation is disposed to con∣tinue this form, the parts have a <HI>national standing,</HI> independent of each other, and are not the creatures of each other. Had Mr. Fox passed through Parliament, and said, that the person alluded to claimed on the ground of the Nation, Mr. Pitt must then have contended (what he called) the right of the Parliament, against the right of the Nation.</P>
<P>By the appearance which the contest made, Mr. Fox took the hereditary ground, and Mr. Pitt the parliamentary ground; but the fact is, they both took hereditary ground, and Mr. Pitt took the worst of the two.</P>
<P>What is called the Parliament, is made up of two Houses; one of which is more hereditary, and more beyond the controul of the Nation, than what the Crown (as it is called) is sup∣posed to be. It is an hereditary aristocracy, assuming and asserting indefeasible, irrevokable rights and authority, wholly independent of the
<PB N="146" REF="148"/>
Nation. Where then was the merited popula∣riity of exalting this hereditary power over ano∣ther hereditary power less independent of the Nation than what itself assumed to be, and of absorbing the rights of the Nation into a House over which it has neither election nor controul?</P>
<P>The general impulse of the Nation was right; but it acted without reflection. It approved the opposition made to the right set up by Mr. Fox, without perceiving that Mr. Pitt was supporting another indefeasible right, more remote from the Nation, in opposition to it.</P>
<P>With respect to the House of Commons, it is elected but by a small part of the Nation; but were the election as universal as taxation, which it ought to be, it would still be only the organ of the Nation, and cannot possess inher∣ent rights.—When the National Assembly of France resolves a matter, the resolve is made in right of the Nation; but Mr. Pitt, on all national questions, so far as they refer to the House of Commons, absorbs the rights of the Nation into the organ, and makes the organ into a Nation, and the Nation itself into a cypher.</P>
<P>In a few words, the question on the Regency was a question on a million a-year, which is appropriated to the executive department: and Mr. Pitt could not possess himself of any management of this sum, without setting up the supremacy of Parliament; and when this was
<PB N="147" REF="149"/>
accomplished, it was indifferent who should be Regent, as he must be Regent at his own cost. Among the curiosities which this contentious debate afforded, was that of making the Great Seal into a King; the affixing of which to an act, was to be royal authority. If, therefore, Royal Authority is a Great Seal, it conse∣quently is in itself nothing; and a good Consti∣tution would be of infinitely more value to the Nation, than what the three Nominal Powers, as they now stand, are worth.</P>
<P>The continual use of the word <HI>Constitution</HI> in the English Parliament, shews there is none; and that the whole is merely a form of Govern∣ment without a Constitution, and constituting itself with what powers it pleases. If there were a Constitution, it certainly could be referred to; and the debate on any constitutional point, would terminate by producing the Constitution. One member says, This is Constitution; and another says, That is Constitution—To-day it is one thing; and to-morrow, it is something else—while the maintaining the debate proves there is none. Constitution is now the cant word of Parliament, tuning itself to the ear of the Nation. Formerly it was the <HI>universal supremacy of Parliament</HI>—the <HI>omnipotence of Par∣liament:</HI> But since the progress of Liberty in France, those phrases have a despotic harshness in their note; and the English Parliament have catched the fashion from the National Assem∣bly,
<PB N="148" REF="150"/>
but without the substance, of speaking of <HI>Constitution.</HI></P>
<P>As the present generation of people in Eng∣land did not make the Government, they are not accountable for any of its defects; but that sooner or later it must come into their hands to undergo a constitutional reformation, is as certain as that the same thing has happened in France. If France, with a revenue of nearly twenty-four millions sterling, with an extent of rich and fertile country above four times larger than England, with a population of twenty-four millions of inhabitants to support taxation, with upwards of ninety millions sterling of gold and silver circulating in the nation, and with a debt less than the present debt of England—still found it necessary, from whatever cause, to come to a settlement of its affairs, it solves the problem of funding for both countries.</P>
<P>It is out of the question to say how long what is called the English constitution has lasted, and to argue from thence how long it is to last; the question is, how long can the funding system last? It is a thing but of modern invention, and has not yet continued beyond the life of a man; yet in that short space it has so far accumulated, that, together with the current expences, it requires an amount of taxes at least equal to the whole landed rental of the nation in acres to defray the annual ex∣penditure.
<PB N="149" REF="151"/>
That a government could not al∣ways have gone on by the same system which has been followed for the last seventy years, must be evident to every man; and for the same reason it cannot always go on.</P>
<P>The funding system is not money; neither is it, properly speaking, credit. It in effect creates upon paper the sum which it appears to borrow, and lays on a tax to keep the imagi∣nary capital alive by the payment of interest, and sends the annuity to market, to be sold for paper already in circulation. If any credit is given, it is to the disposition of the people to pay the tax, and not to the government which lays it on. When this disposition expires, what is supposed to be the credit of Government expires with it. The instance of France under the former Government, shews that it is im∣possible to compel the payment of taxes by force, when a whole nation is determined to take its stand upon that ground.</P>
<P>Mr. Burke, in his review of the finances of France, states the quantity of gold and silver in France, at about eighty-eight millions ster∣ling. In doing this, he has, I presume, divided by the difference of exchange, instead of the standard of twenty-four livres to a pound ster∣ling; for M. Neckar's statement, from which Mr. Burke's is taken, is <HI>two thousand two hun∣dred millions of livres,</HI> which is upwards of ninety-one millions and an half sterling.</P>
<P><PB N="150" REF="152"/>M. Neckar in France, and Mr. George Chalmers of the Office of Trade and Plantation in England, of which Lord Hawkesbury is president, published nearly about the same time (1786) an account of the quantity of money in each nation, from the returns of the Mint of each nation. Mr. Chalmers, from the returns of the English Mint at the Tower of London, states the quantity of money in England, in∣cluding Scotland and Ireland, to be twenty millions sterling<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>See</HI> Estimate of the Comparative Strength of Great Britain,<HI>by G. Chalmers.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>M. Neckar <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See Administration of the Finances of France, Vol. III. by M. Neckar.</NOTE> says, that the amount of money in France, recoined from the old coin which was called in, was two thousand five hundred millions of livres, (upwards of one hundred and four millions sterling); and, after deducting for waste, and what may be in the West Indies, and other possible circumstances, states the circulation quantity at home, to be ninety-one millions and an half sterling; but, taking it as Mr. Burke has put it, it is sixty-eight millions more than the national quantity in England.</P>
<P>That the quantity of money in France can∣not be under this sum, may at once be seen from the state of the French Revenue, without referring to the records of the French Mint for proofs. The revenue of France prior to
<PB N="151" REF="153"/>
the Revolution, was nearly twenty-four mil∣lions sterling; and as paper had then no exist∣ence in France, the whole revenue was col∣lected upon gold and silver; and it would have been impossible to have collected such a quan∣tity of revenue upon a less national quantity than M. Neckar has stated. Before the estab∣lishment of paper in England, the revenue was about a fourth part of the national amount of gold and silver, as may be known by referring to the revenue prior to King William, and the quantity of money stated to be in the nation at that time, which was nearly as much as it is now.</P>
<P>It can be of no real service to a Nation, to impose upon itself, or to permit itself to be imposed upon; but the prejudices of some, and the imposition of others, have always repre∣sented France as a nation possessing but little money—whereas the quantity is not only more than four times what the quantity is in England, but is considerably greater on a proportion of numbers. To account for this deficiency on the part of England, some reference should be had to the English system of funding. It ope∣rates to multiply paper, and to substitute it in the room of money, in various shapes; and the more paper is multiplied, the more opportu∣nities are afforded to export the specie; and it admits of a possibility (by extending it to
<PB N="152" REF="154"/>
small notes) of increasing paper till there is no money left.</P>
<P>I know this is not a pleasant subject to English readers; but the matters I am going to mention, are so important in themselves, as to require the attention of men interested in money-transactions of a public nature.—There is a circumstance stated by M. Neckar, in his treatise on the administration of the finances, which has never been attended to in England, but which forms the only basis whereon to esti∣mate the quantity of money (gold and silver) which ought to be in every nation in Europe, to preserve a relative proportion with other nations.</P>
<P>Lisbon and Cadiz are the two ports into which (money) gold and silver from South America are imported, and which afterwards divides and spreads itself over Europe by means of commerce, and increases the quantity of money in all parts of Europe. If, therefore, the amount of the annual importation into Europe can be known, and the relative pro∣portion of the foreign commerce of the several nations by which it is distributed can be ascer∣tained, they give a rule, sufficiently true, to ascertain the quantity of money which ought to be found in any nation, at any given time.</P>
<P>M. Neckar shews from the registers of Lis∣bon and Cadiz, that the importation of gold and silver into Europe, is five millions sterling
<PB N="153" REF="155"/>
annually. He has not taken it on a single year, but on an average of fifteen succeeding years, from 1763 to 1777, both inclusive; in which time, the amount was one thousand eight hundred million livres, which is seventy-five millions sterling <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Administration of the Finances of France, Vol. iii.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>From the commencement of the Hanover succession in 1714, to the time Mr. Chalmers published, is seventy-two years; and the quan∣tity imported into Europe, in that time, would be three hundred and sixty millions sterling.</P>
<P>If the foreign commerce of Great Britain be stated at a sixth part of what the whole foreign commerce of Europe amounts to, (which is probably an inferior estimation to what the gentlemen at the Exchange would allow) the proportion which Britain should draw by commerce of this sum, to keep herself on a proportion with the rest of Europe, would be also a sixth part, which is sixty mil∣lions sterling; and if the same allowance for waste and accident be made for England which M. Neckar makes for France, the quantity remaining after these deductions would be fifty-two millions; and this sum ought to have been in the nation (at the time Mr. Chalmers pub∣lished) in addition to the sum which was in the nation at the commencement of the Hano∣ver succession, and to have made in the whole at least sixty-six millions sterling; instead of
<PB N="154" REF="156"/>
which, there were but twenty millions, which is forty-six millions below its proportionate quantity.</P>
<P>As the quantity of gold and silver imported into Lisbon and Cadiz, is more exactly ascer∣tained than that of any commodity imported into England; and as the quantity of money coined at the Tower of London, is still more positively known; the leading facts do not admit of controversy. Either, therefore, the commerce of England is unproductive of profit, or the gold and silver which it brings in, leak continually away by unseen means, at the average rate of about three quarters of a million a-year, which, in the course of seventy-two years, accounts for the deficiency; and its absence is supplied by paper <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Whether the English commerce does not bring in money, or whether the Government sends it out after it is brought in, is a matter which the parties concerned can best explain; but that the deficiency exists, is not in the power of either to disprove. While Dr. Price, Mr. Eden (now Auckland), Mr. Chalmers, and others, were debating whether the quantity of money in England was greater or less than at the Revolution, the circum∣stance was not adverted to, that since the Revolution, there can∣not have been less than four hundred millions sterling imported into Europe; and therefore, the quantity in England ought at least to have been four times greater than it was at the Revo∣lution, to be on a proportion with Europe. What England is now doing by paper, is what she would have been able to have done by solid money, if gold and silver had come into the nation in the proportion it ought, or had not been sent out; and she is endeavouring to restore by paper, the balance she has lost by money. It is certain, that the gold and silver which arrive annu∣ally in the register-ships to Spain and Portugal, do not remain in those countries. Taking the value half in gold and half in silver, it is about four hundred tons annually; and from the number of ships and galloons employed in the trade of bringing those metals from South America to Portugal and Spain, the quantity sufficiently proves itself, without referring to the regis∣ters.</P>
<P>In the situation England now is, it is impossible she can increase in money. High taxes not only lessen the property of the indi∣viduals, but they lessen also the money-capital of a nation, by inducing smuggling, which can only be carried on by gold and silver. By the politics which the British Government have carried on with the Inland Powers of Germany and the Continent, it has made an enemy of all the Maritime Powers, and is there∣fore obliged to keep up a large navy; but though the navy is built in England, the naval stores must be purchased from abroad, and that from countries where the greatest part must be paid for in gold and silver. Some fallacious rumours have been set afloat in England to induce a belief of money, and, among others, that of the French refugees bringing great quantities. The idea is ridiculous. The general part of the money in France is silver; and it would take upwards of twenty of the largest broad wheel waggons, with ten horses each, to remove one million sterling of silver. Is it then to be supposed, that a few people fleeing on horse-back, or in post-chaises, in a secret manner, and having the French Custom-House to pass, and the sea to cross, could bring even a sufficiency for their own expences?</P>
<P>When millions of money are spoken of, it should be recollected, that such sums can only accumulate in a country by slow degrees, and a long procession of time. The most frugal system that England could now adopt, would not recover, in a century, the balance she has lost in money since the commencement of the Hanover succession. She is seventy millions behind France, and she must be in some considerable proportion behind every country in Europe, because the returns of the English Mint do not shew an increase of money, while the registers of Lisbon and Cadiz shew an European increase of between three and four hundred millions sterling.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="155" REF="157"/>The Revolution of France is attended with many novel circumstances, not only in the po∣litical
<PB N="156" REF="158"/>
sphere, but in the circle of money trans∣actions. Among others, it shews that a Go∣vernment may be in a state of insolvency, and a Nation rich. So far as the fact is confined to the late Government of France, it was in∣solvent; because the Nation would no longer support its extravagance, and therefore it could no longer support itself—but with respect to the Nation, all the means existed. A Govern∣ment may be said to be insolvent, every time it applies to a Nation to discharge its arrears. The insolvency of the late Government of France, and the present Government of Eng∣land, differed in no other respect than as the disposition of the people differ. The people of France refused their aid to the old Govern∣ment; and the people of England submit to taxation without enquiry. What is called the Crown in England, has been insolvent several times; the last of which, publicly known, was in May 1777, when it applied to the Nation to discharge upwards of £. 600,000, private debts, which otherwise it could not pay.</P>
<P>It was the error of Mr. Pitt, Mr. Burke, and all those who were unacquainted with the affairs of France, to confound the French Na∣tion with the French Government. The French Nation, in effect, endeavoured to render the late Government insolvent, for the purpose of taking Government into its own hands; and it reserved its means for the support of the new
<PB N="157" REF="159"/>
Government. In a country of such vast extent and population as France, the natural means cannot be wanting; and the political means appear the instant the Nation is disposed to permit them. When Mr. Burke, in a speech last Winter in the British Parliament, <HI>cast his eyes over the map of Europe, and saw a chasm that once was France,</HI> he talked like a dreamer of dreams. The same natural France existed as be∣fore, and all the natural means existed with it. The only chasm was that which the extinction of despotism had left, and which was to be filled up with a constitution more formidable in resources than the power which had expired.</P>
<P>Although the French Nation rendered the late Government insolvent, it did not permit the insolvency to act towards the creditors; and the creditors considering the Nation as the real paymaster, and the Government only as the agent, rested themselves on the Nation, in pre∣ference to the Government. This appears greatly to disturb Mr. Burke, as the precedent is fatal to the policy by which Governments have supposed themselves secure. They have contracted debts, with a view of attaching what is called the monied interest of a Nation to their support; but the example in France shews, that the permanent security of the creditor is in the Nation, and not in the Government; and that in all possible revolutions that may happen in Governments, the means are always with the
<PB N="158" REF="160"/>
Nation, and the Nation always in existence. Mr. Burke argues, that the creditors ought to have abided the fate of the Government which they trusted; but the National Assembly con∣sidered them as the creditors of the Nation, and not of the Government—of the master, and not of the steward.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding the late Government could not discharge the current expences, the present Government has paid off a great part of the capital. This has been accomplished by two means; the one by lessening the expences of Government, and the other by the sale of the monastic and ecclesiastical landed estates. The devotees and penitent debauchees, extortioners and misers of former days, to ensure themselves a better world than that which they were about to leave, had bequeathed immense property in trust to the priesthood, for <HI>pious uses;</HI> and the priesthood kept it for themselves. The Na∣tional Assembly has ordered it to be sold for the good of the whole Nation, and the priest∣hood to be decently provided for.</P>
<P>In consequence of the Revolution, the an∣nual interest of the debt of France will be re∣duced at least six millions sterling, by paying off upwards of one hundred millions of the capital; which, with lessening the former ex∣pences of Government at least three millions, will place France in a situation worthy the imitation of Europe.</P>
<P><PB N="159" REF="161"/>Upon a whole review of the subject, how vast is the contrast! While Mr. Burke has been talking of a general bankruptcy in France, the National Assembly has been paying off the capital of its debt; and while taxes have increased near a million a-year in England, they have lowered several millions a-year in France. Not a word has either Mr. Burke or Mr. Pitt said about French affairs, or the state of the French finances, in the present Session of Parliament. The subject begins to be too well understood, and imposition serves no longer.</P>
<P>There is a general enigma running through the whole of Mr. Burke's Book. He writes in a rage against the National Assembly; but what is he enraged about? If his assertions were as true as they are groundless, and that France, by her Revolution, had annihilated her power, and become what he calls a <HI>chasm,</HI> it might excite the grief of a Frenchman, (con∣sidering himself as a national man), and pro∣voke his rage against the National Assembly; but why should it excite the rage of Mr. Burke?—Alas! it is not the Nation of France that Mr. Burke means, but the COURT; and every Court in Europe, dreading the same fate, is in mourning. He writes neither in the cha∣racter of a Frenchman nor an Englishman, but in the fawning character of that creature known in all countries, and a friend to none,
<PB N="160" REF="162"/>
a COURTIER. Whether it be the Court of Versailles, or the Court of St. James or Carl∣ton-House, or the Court in expectation, sig∣nifies not; for the caterpillar principle of all Courts and Courtiers are alike. They form a common policy throughout Europe, detached and separate from the interest of Nations: and while they appear to quarrel, they agree to plunder. Nothing can be more terrible to a Court or a Courtier, than the Revolution of France. That which is a blessing to Nations, is bitterness to them; and as their existence depends on the duplicity of a country, they tremble at the approach of principles, and dread the precedent that threatens their over∣throw.</P>

<HEAD>CONCLUSION.</HEAD>
<P>REASON and Ignorance, the opposites of each other, influence the great bulk of man∣kind. If either of these can be rendered suffi∣ciently extensive in a country, the machinery of Government goes easily on. Reason obeys itself; and Ignorance submits to whatever is dictated to it.</P>
<P>The two modes of Government which pre∣vail in the world, are, <HI>first,</HI> Government by election and representation: <HI>Secondly,</HI> Govern∣ment by hereditary succession. The former is generally known by the name of republic; the latter by that of monarchy and aristocracy.</P>
<P>Those two distinct and opposite forms, erect themselves on the two distinct and opposite bases of Reason and Ignorance.—As the exer∣cise of Government requires talents and abili∣ties, and as talents and abilities cannot have hereditary descent, it is evident that hereditary succession requires a belief from man, to which his reason cannot subscribe, and which can only be established upon his ignorance; and the more ignorant any country is, the better it is fitted for this species of Government.</P>
<P>On the contrary, Government in a well-constituted republic, requires no belief from man beyond what his reason can give. He sees the <HI>rationale</HI> of the whole system, its origin and its operation; and as it is best supported
<PB N="162" REF="164"/>
when best understood, the human faculties act with boldness, and acquire, under this form of Government, a gigantic manliness.</P>
<P>As, therefore, each of those forms acts on a different base, the one moving freely by the aid of reason, the other by ignorance; we have next to consider, what it is that gives motion to that species of Government which is called mixed Government, or, as it is sometimes lu∣dicrously stiled, a Government of <HI>this, that,</HI> and <HI>t'other.</HI></P>
<P>The moving power in this species of Go∣vernment, is of necessity, Corruption. How∣ever imperfect election and representation may be in mixed Governments, they still give ex∣ercise to a greater portion of reason than is con∣venient to the hereditary Part; and therefore it becomes necessary to buy the reason up. A mixed Government is an imperfect every-thing, cementing and soldering the discordant parts toge<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>her by corruption, to act as a whole. Mr. Burke appears highly disgusted, that France, since she had resolved on a revolution, did not adopt what he calls <HI>"A British Constitution;"</HI> and the regretful manner in which he expresses himself on this occasion, implies a suspicion, that the British Constitution needed something to keep its defects in countenance.</P>
<P>In mixed Governments there is no responsi∣bility: the parts cover each other till respon∣sibility is lost; and the corruption which moves
<PB N="163" REF="165"/>
the machine, contrives at the same time its own escape. When it is laid down as a maxim, that <HI>a King can do no wrong,</HI> it places him in a state of similar security with that of ideots and persons insane, and responsibility is out of the question with respect to himself. It then descends upon the Minister, who shel∣ters himself under a majority in Parliament, which, by places, pensions, and corruption, he can always command; and that majority justi∣fies itself by the same authority with which it protects the Minister. In this rotatory motion, responsibility is thrown off from the parts, and from the whole.</P>
<P>When there is a Part in a Government which can do no wrong, it implies that it does no∣thing; and is only the machine of another power, by whose advice and direction it acts. What is supposed to be the King in mixed Governments, is the Cabinet; and as the Ca∣binet is always a part of the Parliament, and the members justifying in one character what they advise and act in another, a mixed Go∣vernment becomes a continual enigma; entail∣ing upon a country, by the quantity of cor∣ruption necessary to solder the parts, the ex∣pence of supporting all the forms of Govern∣ment at once, and finally resolving itself into a Government by Committee; in which the advisers, the actors, the approvers, the justi∣fiers,
<PB N="164" REF="166"/>
the persons responsible, and the persons not responsible, are the same persons.</P>
<P>By this pantomimical contrivance, and change of scene and character, the parts help each other out in matters which neither of them singly would assume to act. When money is to be obtained, the mass of variety apparently dissolves, and a profusion of parliamentary praises passes between the parts. Each ad∣mires with astonishment, the wisdom, the libe∣rality, the disinterestedness of the other; and all of them breathe a pitying sigh at the bur∣thens of the Nation.</P>
<P>But in a well-constituted republic, nothing of this soldering, praising, and pitying, can take place; the representation being equal through∣out the country, and compleat in itself, however it may be arranged into legislative and execu∣tive, they have all one and the same natural source. The parts are not foreigners to each other, like democracy, aristocracy, and monar∣chy. As there are no discordant distinctions, there is nothing to corrupt by compromise, nor confound by contrivance. Public measures appeal of themselves to the understanding of the Nation, and, resting on their own merits, dis∣own any flattering application to vanity. The continual whine of lamenting the burden of taxes, however successfully it may be practised in mixed Governments, is inconsistent with the
<PB N="165" REF="167"/>
sense and spirit of a republic. If taxes are necessary, they are of course advantageous; but if they require an apology, the apology itself implies an impeachment. Why then is man thus imposed upon, or why does he impose upon himself?</P>
<P>When men are spoken of as kings and subjects, or when Government is mentioned under the dis∣tinct or combined heads of monarchy, aristocracy, and democracy, what is it that <HI>reasoning</HI> man is to understand by the terms? If there really existed in the world two or more distinct and separate <HI>elements</HI> of human power, we should then see the several origins to which those terms would de∣scriptively apply: but as there is but one species of man, there can be but one element of human power; and that element is man himself. Monar∣chy, aristocracy, and democracy, are but creatures of imagination; and a thousand such may be con∣trived, as well as three.</P>
<P>From the Revolutions of America and France, and the symptoms that have appeared in other coun∣tries, it is evident that the opinion of the world is changed with respect to systems of Government, and that revolutions are not within the compass of political calculations. The progress of time and circumstances, which men assign to the accomplish∣ment of great changes, is too mechanical to mea∣sure the force of the mind, and the rapidity of reflection, by which revolutions are generated:
<PB N="166" REF="168"/>
All the old governments have received a shock from those that already appear, and which were once more improbable, and are a greater subject of wonder, than a general revolution in Europe would be now.</P>
<P>When we survey the wretched condition of man under the monarchical and hereditary systems of Government, dragged from his home by one power, or driven by another, and impoverished by taxes more than by enemies, it becomes evident that those systems are bad, and that a general revo∣lution in the principle and construction of Govern∣ments is necessary.</P>
<P>What is government more than the management of the affairs of a Nation? It is not, and from its nature cannot be, the property of any particular man or family, but of the whole community, at whose expence it is supported; and though by force or contrivance it has been usurped into an inheritance, the usurpation cannot alter the right of things. Sovereignty, as a matter of right, appertains to the Nation only, and not to any individual; and a Nation has at all times an in∣herent indefeasible right to abolish any form of Government it finds inconvenient, and establish such as accords with its interest, disposition, and happiness. The romantic and barbarous distinction of men into Kings and subjects, though it may suit the condition of courtiers, cannot that of citizens; and is exploded by the principle upon which Governments are now founded. Every
<PB N="167" REF="169"/>
citizen is a member of the Sovereignty, and, as such, can acknowledge no personal subjection; and his obedience can be only to the laws.</P>
<P>When men think of what Government is, they must necessarily suppose it to possess a knowledge of all the objects and matters upon which its authority is to be exercised. In this view of Go∣vernment, the republican system, as established by America and France, operates to embrace the whole of a Nation; and the knowledge necessary to the in∣terest of all the parts, is to be found in the center, which the parts by representation form: But the old Governments are on a construction that ex∣cludes knowledge as well as happiness; Govern∣ment by Monks, who know nothing of the world beyond the walls of a Convent, is as consistent as government by Kings.</P>
<P>What were formerly called Revolutions, were little more than a change of persons, or an altera∣tion of local circumstances. They rose and fell like things of course, and had nothing in their existence or their fate that could influence beyond the spot that produced them. But what we now see in the world, from the Revolutions of America and France, are a renovation of the natural order of things, a system of principles as universal as truth and the existence of man, and combining moral with political happiness and national pro∣sperity.</P>
<P N="1"><Q><HI>I.</HI> Men are born and always continue free, and equal in respect of their rights. Civil distinctions, therefore, can be founded only on public utility.</Q></P>
<P N="2"><PB N="168" REF="170"/><Q><HI>II.</HI> The end of all political associations is the pre∣servation of the natural and imprescriptible rights of man; and these rights are liberty, property, security, and resistance of oppression.</Q></P>
<P N="3"><Q><HI>III.</HI> The Nation is essentially the source of all So∣vereignty; nor can any <HI>INDIVIDUAL,</HI> or <HI>ANY BODY OF MEN,</HI> be entitled to any authority which is not expressly derived from it.</Q></P>
<P>In these principles, there is nothing to throw a Nation into confusion by inflaming ambition. They are calculated to call forth wisdom and abilities, and to exercise them for the public good, and not for the emolument or aggrandizement of particular descriptions of men or families. Monar∣chical sovereignty, the enemy of mankind, and the source of misery, is abolished; and sovereignty itself is restored to its natural and original place, the Nation. Were this the case throughout Europe, the cause of wars would be taken away.</P>
<P>It is attributed to Henry the Fourth of France, a man of an enlarged and benevolent heart, that he proposed, about the year 1610, a plan for abolishing war in Europe. The plan consisted in constituting an European Congress, or as the French Authors stile it, a Pacific Republic; by appointing delegates from the several Nations, who were to act as a Court of arbitration in any disputes that might arise between nation and nation.</P>
<P>Had such a plan been adopted at the time it was proposed, the taxes of England and France, as two of the parties, would have been at least ten millions sterling annually to each Nation less than
<PB N="169" REF="171"/>
they were at the commencement of the French Revolution.</P>
<P>To conceive a cause why such a plan has not been adopted, (and that instead of a Congress for the purpose of <HI>preventing</HI> war, it has been called only to <HI>terminate</HI> a war, after a fruitless expence of several years), it will be necessary to consider the interest of Governments as a distinct interest to that of Nations.</P>
<P>Whatever is the cause of taxes to a Nation, becomes also the means of revenue to a Govern∣ment. Every war terminates with an addition of taxes, and consequently with an addition of revenue; and in any event of war, in the manner they are now commenced and concluded, the power and interest of Governments are increased. War, therefore, from its productiveness, as it easily furnishes the pretence of necessity for taxes and appointments to places and offices, becomes a prin∣cipal part of the system of old Governments; and to establish any mode to abolish war, however advantageous it might be to Nations, would be to take from such Government the most lucrative of its branches. The frivolous matters upon which war is made, shew the disposition and avidity of Governments to uphold the system of war, and betray the motives upon which they act.</P>
<P>Why are not Republics plunged into war, but because the nature of their Government does not admit of an interest distinct from that of the Nation? Even Holland, though an ill-constructed Republic,
<PB N="170" REF="172"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ith a commerce extending over the world, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> nearly a century without war: and the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>tant the form of Government was changed in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rance, the republican principles of peace and domestic prosperity and oeconomy arose with the new Government; and the same consequences would follow the same causes in other Nations.</P>
<P>As war is the system of Government on the old construction, the animosity which Nations reciprocally entertain, is nothing more than what the policy of their Governments excites, to keep up the spirit of the system. Each Government accuses the other of perfidy, intrigue, and ambition, as a means of heating the imagination of their respective Nations, and incensing them to hostilities. Man is not the enemy of man, but through the medium of a false system of Government. Instead, there∣fore, of exclaiming against the ambition of Kings, the exclamation should be directed against the principle of such Governments; and instead of seeking to reform the individual, the wisdom of a Nation should apply itself to reform the system.</P>
<P>Whether the forms and maxims of Govern∣ments which are still in practice, were adapted to the condition of the world at the period they were established, is not in this case the question. The order they are, the less correspondence can they have with the present state of things. Time, and change of circumstances and opinions, have the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>e progressive effect in rendering modes of Government obsolete, as they have upon customs
<PB N="171" REF="173"/>
and manners.—Agriculture, commerce, manufac∣tures, and the tranquil arts, by which the prosperity of Nations is best promoted, require a different system of Government, and a different species of knowledge to direct its operations, than what might have been required in the former condition of the world.</P>
<P>As it is not difficult to perceive, from the enlightened state of mankind, that hereditary Governments are verging to their decline, and that Revolutions on the broad basis of national sovereignty, and Government by representation, are making their way in Europe, it would be an act of wisdom to anticipate their approach, and produce Revolutions by reason and accommoda∣tion, rather than commit them to the issue of con∣vulsions.</P>
<P>From what we now see, nothing of reform in the political world ought to be held improbable. It is an age of Revolutions, in which every thing may be looked for. The intrigue of Courts, by which the system of war is kept up, may provoke a confederation of Nations to abolish it: and an European Congress, to patronize the progress of free Government, and promote the civilization of Nations with each other, is an event nearer in probability, than once were the revolutions and alliance of France and America.</P>
