<P>AN ACCURATE AND DESCRIPTIVE CATALOGUE OF THE SEVERAL PAINTINGS IN THE KING OF SPAIN's PALACE AT MADRID; WITH SOME ACCOUNT OF THE PICTURES IN THE BUEN-RETIRO.</P>

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>THIS Catalogue was made at my request by the Gentleman, who has the superintendance of the Royal Collection in the Palace at Madrid; and by his favour transmitted to me after my return out of Spain, but too late to be inserted in my <HI>Anecdotes of Spanish Painters:</HI> There can be no doubt therefore of its being accurate; and I have accordingly so stated it in the title of this publication. If the <HI>descriptive</HI> part had been executed by
<PB N="iv" REF="3"/>
the same hand, I might have safely re∣commended this performance even to <HI>Professors</HI> of the Art; I must now ad∣dress it to the <HI>Lovers</HI> only, and sub∣mit my weak attempt, with all its errors, to the candour of the Public.</P>

<HEAD>FRESCOS.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="room">
<HEAD>1. Great Stair-Case; by D. Cor∣rado Giaciunto.</HEAD>
<P>THE composition of this bril∣liant ceiling represents the rising of the Sun: Apollo, sur∣rounded by various allegorical fi∣gures and emblems, gives life and motion to the Elements. Spain, as a matron, habited in an imperial
<PB N="2" REF="5"/>
mantle, with several attributes and insignia proper to her character. The colouring, drawing and design very masterly.</P>
<P>The stair-case itself is a very magnificent work, projected and executed by the celebrated <HI>Sabatini,</HI> a Neapolitan, Architect to His Ca∣tholic Majesty.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="room">
<HEAD>2. Great Guard-Chamber; by D. Juan Bautista Tiepolo.</HEAD>
<P>Vulcan forging the armour of Aeneas at the request of Venus: Mars, in a triumphal character, su∣perintending and protecting the work. Various figures, emblema∣tic of the Provinces, Religion, Va∣lour, Victories and Productions of Spain.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="room">
<PB N="3" REF="6"/>
<HEAD>3. Ball-Room; by Corrado.</HEAD>
<P>In the center of this ceiling Re∣ligion is seated, and the Church triumphant, enthroned amidst the clouds; to which Spain is offering gifts and incense in an attitude of adoration: The nations, subject to her empire, are introduced with their respective emblems: In the four corners are the Elements, in medallic compartments: Over one of the entrances there is a group of various figures, with Boys em∣ployed in placing crowns of palm upon the principal characters: Over another entrance, Hercules is de∣scribed in the act of pulling down his pillars at the command of Nep∣tune, who in his chariot passes the
<PB N="4" REF="7"/>
Streights, making his way through the barrier of antient navigation. This is a very brilliant design, rich and glowing in colour and execu∣tion, and producing a very superb and striking effect.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="room">
<HEAD>4. King's Anti-Chamber; by Tie∣polo.</HEAD>
<P>The Monarchy of Spain, as a majestic Matron in an imperial mantle, with a Lion at her side: An attendant figure in the act of placing a crown on her head: Apollo with his lyre and the Muses form a separate group: Castile in the character of a female, with her proper attributes: Hercules break∣ing down his pillars for the purpose of laying open the barrier of Africa:
<PB N="5" REF="8"/>
Sacrifices and Oblations repre∣sented in four medallic compart∣ments, and addressed to the Deities, who appear in the principal com∣position.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="5" TYPE="room">
<HEAD>5. Grand Saloon; by the same Master.</HEAD>
<P>The painter has here personified the various characters of the Spa∣nish monarchy: The figures are emblematic of Power, Religion, Wealth, Plenty, Victory, &amp;c. &amp;c. The provinces of Spain are disposed over the cornice with their proper attributes: The medals in the an∣gles are by the same master; but the Boys that support them, and the naked River-Gods, as likewise the gilt compartments, where the Ele∣ments
<PB N="6" REF="9"/>
are represented, are by the hand of <HI>Robert Mitchell.</HI> This ceil∣ing and all the embellishments are profusely rich and splendid.</P>
<P><HI>Tiepolo</HI> was a student of the Ve∣netian school, and died at Madrid, in the king's service, on the 27th of March 1770.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="6" TYPE="room">
<HEAD>6. King's Dining-Room; by A. R. Mengs.</HEAD>
<P><HI>The Apotheosis of Trajan.</HI> The deified Hero is seated on a throne of resplendent glory: The virtues and attributes of a perfect monarch surround his throne: A chaplet of laurel is supported in the air by five imaginary beings, under which the artist has contrived to deli∣neate the victories of this imperial
<PB N="7" REF="10"/>
Spaniard: The temple of Immor∣tality appears in view, and the choir of Muses are seen in the act of ce∣lebrating his glories. Other alle∣gorical figures are interspersed in the composition with extraordinary judgment and contrivance.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="7" TYPE="room">
<HEAD>7. King's Supper-Room; by the same.</HEAD>
<P><HI>The Apotheosis of Hercules.</HI> He is conducted by Mercury to Jupi∣ter, who invests him with the crown of immortality, as a reward for his labours and conquests: A group of Deities assist in the ceremony; the distinguishing characteristics of the several Deities, male and fe∣male, are marked with great taste and much classical precision: The
<PB N="8" REF="11"/>
artist has given proof of his pro∣found study and experience in the antique: The colouring, perspec∣tive, and general disposition of these two ceilings are inimitable: There is no crowd, flutter, or deficiency in the whole or part; the several groups conspire and harmonize in the most perfect and beautiful man∣ner; the eye is not distracted by any predominance of detached parts, but receives the whole magnificent composition, as one compleat pic∣ture, at a glance.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="note">
<P>These Frescos (especially the Apotheosis of Trajan) are, as I conceive, far superior to his Paint∣ings in oil; and in this province of his art, Mengs appears a very ca∣pital master: I have never seen any
<PB N="9" REF="12"/>
thing equal to them; and so admi∣rable they appeared to me upon re∣peated visits, that I must believe there are few productions in art, which can better gratify the curio∣sity of a traveller. One thing is clear, that <HI>Mengs</HI>'s colouring in fresco is totally of another cast from what he practised upon can∣vass.</P>
</DIV2>

<HEAD>8. King's Retiring-Room; by Tiepolo.</HEAD>
<P>Juno in her car, with her proper attributes, &amp;c.</P>

<DIV2 N="10" TYPE="room">
<HEAD>10. Queen's second Anti-Chamber; by Antonio Velasquez.</HEAD>
<P>The subject nearly corresponds with the above, and the artist has treated it pretty much in the same manner: Both are respectable per∣formances. <HI>Antonio</HI> was the bro∣ther of <HI>Luis Velasquez.</HI></P>

</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="13" TYPE="room">
<HEAD>13. State Bed-Chamber; by Mengs.</HEAD>
<P>Another beautiful composition of this master, representing Aurora going forth in her car, drawn by horses: All the emblems of Morn∣ing are exquisitely conceived: The breaking forth of Light (which is personified), the accompaniment of the Hours, the group of Night and her attendant emblems in the rear of the procession, and all the cor∣respondent embellishments in high
<PB N="12" REF="15"/>
relief, are finely executed: In these are represented the four Seasons of the year, and the Elements.</P>

<P>The Choice of Hercules.</P>
<P><HI>Maella</HI> was a disciple of <HI>Mengs,</HI> and is now in the service of the King as Royal Artist: He has made several portraits of the royal family. I have seen some good original compositions of this mas∣ter, and several copies from <HI>Mengs</HI> and the elder painters of great me∣rit and truth: I am convinced he is a man of talents and candour, and could refer to a striking in∣stance of his honour and integrity. I would recommend it to any ar∣tist, or lover of art, who shall visit Madrid, to introduce himself to the acquaintance of <HI>Maella,</HI> from whose

<HEAD>PICTURES.</HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="room">
<HEAD>King's Anti-Chamber.</HEAD>
<DIV3 TYPE="artist">
<P><HI>Titian.</HI> Two large pictures of Sisyphus and Prometheus in their torments: the figures above hu∣man size: They were painted by this master in Spain, and are fi∣gures of great force, colouring and expression. The manner of treat∣ing the Prometheus much resembles that of a celebrated picture on the same subject at Kimbolton Castle: As the noble owner has no deter∣mined tradition of its author, I shall hazard a conjecture, that it
<PB N="17" REF="20"/>
was painted by <HI>Rubens</HI> upon the idea of this figure of <HI>Titian</HI>'s, after that artist had visited Spain.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="artist">
<P><HI>Titian.</HI> Four half-length pour∣traits of Women, not in his bright∣est manner.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="artist">
<P><HI>Titian.</HI> Four pourtraits of Men, seemingly of the same period; one of which is a pourtrait of the great artist himself in his advanced age; a grand and venerable piece.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="artist">
<P><HI>Titian.</HI> A pourtrait of a Boy, full length. Correct and beautiful nature.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="artist">
<P><HI>Titian.</HI> Two fancy composi∣tions, companions; the figures half length: One, two Bacchants; the other a Venus, admiring herself in a
<PB N="18" REF="21"/>
Mirror, which Cupid holds up to her face. With one of her hands she presses her bosom, which is un∣covered, and the action is delicately expressed. These pictures hang level with the eye on each side of a door fronting the great entrance; the effect is remarkably striking, the relief bold, and the colouring nature itself; but perhaps the exe∣cution has not that finished delica∣cy, which many of his earlier com∣positions have: The characters, both of one and the other, are cer∣tainly of a wanton cast; the per∣son half-uncovered, half-concealed, with such a studied negligence of dress, and so much playfulness of expression and attitude, that the draperies seem introduced sor no
<PB N="19" REF="22"/>
other purpose but to attract the at∣tention more strongly to the charms they do not serve to hide.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="artist">
<P><HI>Titian.</HI> Venus presents a cup to a Nymph: Two Satyrs in the back ground with baskets of fruit: This, like the former, is the <HI>Venus lasciva.</HI> The contrast of hues between the prominent figure and the Satyrs in shades is managed with masterly address.</P>
<P>All who are conversant in the works of this master will better conceive the striking effect of these three compositions, than any de∣scription of mine can convey: In whatever collection they hung, they would certainly be very dangerous neighbours to most other colourists who came in contact with them.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="artist">
<PB N="20" REF="23"/>
<P><HI>Titian.</HI> Adam and Eve in Pa∣radise; the size of life; a very ca∣pital picture, upon a large canvass; both figures of consummate beauty, and of a sublime and chaste charac∣ter; their attitudes simple, natural, without any trace of the Academy in their disposition: The carna∣tions are not florid, and the whole hue of the piece rather duskier than is usual with this master: The back-ground presents a noble land∣scape; the scenery finely character∣ed, and in beautiful harmony.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="artist">
<P><HI>Rubens.</HI> A copy of the above on a cloth of the same size; this copy hangs between the windows in an unfavourable light, and op∣posite to the original. It is a mas∣terpiece of colouring, and though
<PB N="21" REF="24"/>
it has missed the delicacy of the model, I am inclined to think it has surpassed it in force and effect. It is evident that Rubens has put his whole strength to the work, and as his efforts have been decidedly ad∣dressed to the colouring, his figures have a broader nakedness (if I may so express it), than they have in the original; whereas there is a purity in Titian's nakedness, which is in character with the subject, and fully corresponds with the most refined conceptions of human nature in it's primitive state of innocence and beauty: When we contemplate Titian's Adam and Eve, we are convinced they never wore cloaths; turn to the copy, and the same per∣sons appear to have laid theirs
<PB N="22" REF="25"/>
aside, and exposed themselves to shame for the credit of the painter.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="artist">
<P><HI>Tintoret.</HI> Two noble composi∣tions from sacred history, compa∣nions. The one a Judith, with the head of Holofernes; the other, a Martyrdom of Saint Ursula and her companions: The characters in both are of great grandeur, finely conceived and executed with pecu∣liar brilliancy and spirit.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="artist">
<P><HI>Paul Veronese.</HI> Two charming pictures, and the subjects beautiful. One, a Venus and a Sleeping Ado∣nis; the other, Cephalus and Pro∣cris, both natural size.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="artist">
<P><HI>Juan Labrador.</HI> Two flower-pieces of the best master Spain ever
<PB N="23" REF="26"/>
produced in this stile of painting. These pieces are held in high es∣teem; and, though in company with works of a superior cast, will attract the admiration of the be∣holder. It has never been my chance to meet with any paintings of the like sort, which I have thought comparable to these of <HI>La∣brador.</HI> He died at Madrid in 1600, at a very advanced age. (See <HI>Anecdotes, vol. i. p.</HI> 151.)</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="artist">
<P><HI>Pedro Orrente.</HI> A Nativity; a capital composition: This picture was removed from the chapel <HI>de los Reyes nuevos,</HI> belonging to the ca∣thedral of Toledo. Orrente was a familiar of the Inquisition, and died in 1642, very old. He was a dis∣ciple of Bassan; and greatly sa∣voured
<PB N="24" REF="27"/>
and employed by the mi∣nister Olivares: <Q REND="inline">"He coloured in the stile of his master, but in his choice of nature did not imitate his vulgarity of taste; in correct∣ness of drawing, he has rarely been exceeded. He was buried at Toledo, where he died, and is deservedly to be numbered amongst the most eminent Spa∣niards of his profession." <BIBL>(<HI>See</HI> Anecdotes, vol. i. p. 193.)</BIBL></Q></P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="artist">
<P><HI>Bassan.</HI> Nine pictures of this master, viz.

<ITEM><HI>Noah,</HI> introducing them into the Ark, its companion; both charm∣ing pictures.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Two upon scripture subjects.</ITEM>

Four of rural and domestic scenes.</ITEM>
<ITEM>One, very beautiful, of <HI>Orpheus</HI> harping to the beasts.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>These pictures have been drawn from the great collection of <HI>Bassans</HI> in the <HI>Buen Retiro;</HI> but it does not appear to have been a very ju∣dicious selection, for they have certainly left many there of a supe∣rior merit to these; particularly some upon historical subjects in a great stile, and which are probably the most capital of their master any where to be met with.</P>

<HEAD>King's Dining-Room.</HEAD>
<DIV3 TYPE="artist">
<P><HI>Velasquez.</HI> Five magnificent pourtraits, by this greatest of all the Spanish masters, adorn this stately
<PB N="26" REF="29"/>
chamber: It is altogether one of the most striking spectacles that can meet the eye; few scenes are to be found, that can better repay the curiosity of a traveller, and a stran∣ger to the works of this great paint∣er. The magnitude of these ob∣jects, the force and vigour of their colouring, the proud character they are displayed in, the profuse splen∣dor of the draperies, and (more than all) the stately horses, on which they are mounted, dressed out with such redundancy of embel∣lishment, conspire to produce an astonishing effect; of these pour∣traits, four are of royal person∣ages, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>Philip III. and IV. and their re∣spective Queens.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="30"/>
The last and best is the pourtrait of the <HI>Conde Duque de Olivares,</HI> minister of Spain and patron of the artist. There are etchings of all these pourtraits, copies of which I brought over from Spain.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="artist">
<P><HI>Rubens.</HI> Philip the Third on horseback: A very noble pour∣trait.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="artist">
<P><HI>Vanlo.</HI> Philip the Fifth on horseback, and Queen Isabella on foot. The inferiority of this artist is rendered very conspicuous by the contrast of the capital pictures a∣bove-mentioned.</P>

<P>The sculptures in this, and the anti-chamber above described, are numerous and fine: In the former there is a remarkable bust of Sene∣ca by Bernini; and in this several of Roman emperors and empresses, antique; an infant Hercules sleep∣ing, of exquisite workmanship, &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>

<PB N="29" REF="32"/>
Germany, with various other per∣sons in different employments; a large group: The painter has intro∣duced two dwarfs, and (what adds greatly to its value) he is repre∣sented in person in the act of paint∣ing the Infanta, whose pourtrait ap∣pears upon the easel. <Q REND="inline">"It is related of this picture, that King Philip, with his own hand, painted the order of Santiago upon the dra∣pery of Velasquez's figure, which order he was not till then possess∣ed of. When Charles the Se∣cond of Spain shewed this pic∣ture to Luca Jordano, he ex∣claimed with rapture and surprize, Sen̄or, <HI>esta es la Theologia de la pintura.</HI>" <BIBL>(Anecdotes, vol. ii. p. 37.)</BIBL></Q></P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="33"/>
A copy of this famous picture, upon a small scale, was taken for the late Lord Grantham, when he was ambassador in Spain, and brought over by his Lordship to England. It is to be hoped his successors in that station will follow his example, and obtain copies or drawings of other capital pictures in that kingdom.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="artist">
<P><HI>Titian.</HI> Charles V. in complete armour; his lance in his hand, his vizor up, and himself mounted on a beautiful horse; he is preparing to pass his troops over a river, which is described in the scenery of the back-ground, of the size of life, upon a very large canvass: This picture sets all description at de∣fiance,
<PB N="31" REF="34"/>
at least all such description as I can attempt: I cannot doubt its being the most capital pourtrait of the master, and has been so es∣teemed by the best judges, who have seen it; there is reason to believe that Titian rated it as such him∣self.</P>
<P>In the countenance of the mo∣narch we read his history, or (which perhaps is nearer to truth) recol∣lecting his history, we acknowlege the agreement of character in every line, and in the reflection of his features we find the painter has re∣corded the annals of his life: Ne∣ver was more expression of a mind committed to canvass. A pensive dignity prevails, traced with marks of pain and bodily decay: He is
<PB N="32" REF="35"/>
deep in thought; his eyes gloomy and severe, the lids heavy, inflated and remarkably low over the eye∣balls; the under-lip projecting, and the mouth characteristic of revenge and resolution: He is advancing to give battle to the unfortunate Elec∣tor of Saxony and the Landgrave, those opposers of his power and of his faith; external objects have no share in his attention; the whole man is engrossed by the deepest meditation: His lance is poised pa∣rallel with the ground, and ranges along the side of his horse, with the point advanced beyond its breast; the action of the animal harmonizes with the character of his rider, slowly and composedly stepping forward, the head low
<PB N="33" REF="36"/>
and submitted, and the eye expres∣sive of the most resigned obedience to his imperial master: All is calm and still in the scene, no flutter or disturbance in the objects; the co∣louring, drawing and perspective are the life itself; the whole is such perfect nature, that art seems extin∣guished by its own excellence.</P>

<P><HI>Velasquez.</HI> A group of Spaniards carousing. These rustic Bacchana∣lians are evidently sketched from nature: Bacchus is introduced sit∣ting on a cask, putting a garland on the head of a Peasant, who kneels at his feet: On his left hand is a group of five other rustics, one of which holds a goblet of wine, ano∣ther a can, and another has a lea∣ther bag slung across his shoulder;
<PB N="36" REF="39"/>
their faces are grotesque and savage, and strongly marked with the Cas∣tilian cast of features: On the right hand of Bacchus are two fi∣gures attendant upon him; one of these is naked, and sits at his back, leaning on one elbow, and in the other hand holding a narrow-bot∣tomed drinking glass with wide lips; the other is in strong shade in the fore-ground, his face turned from the spectator, in a crouching attitude, embracing a large earthen amphora, which stands on the ground; both these figures are crowned with wreaths of vine; and the God, who has a mantle loosely thrown over his waist, has his whole head covered with a large cluster of broad vine leaves,
<PB N="37" REF="40"/>
in a grand and picturesque stile: His countenance is strongly charac∣tered in the Moorish or Andalusian cast, with a broad nose, full lips, wide mouth, and black sparkling eyes: The figures are of the size of life. A very capital compo∣sition.</P>

it with consummate address. The effect of light and shade from the reflection of the forge, and the sparks which fly from their ham∣mers, produce a striking effect.

<P>This is his celebrated picture, which the king has covered with a magnificent plate of glass: It was painted at Rome, and sent from

thence to Madrid. In the person of one of the Shepherds, the artist has introduced his own pourtrait: The whole is laboured with amaz∣ing care and study, and very ten∣derly coloured: His miniature-edu∣cation is conspicuous in this per∣formance, and the Infant is remark∣ably diminutive and delicate: The subject perhaps precludes origina∣lity, and it does not seem to be attempted. It is scarce necessary to add, that this picture is a great court-favourite; all the works of <HI>Mengs</HI> are generally extolled in Spain, and this the most: I have observed, however, that the opi∣nions of mankind at large, with re∣gard to his rank in the list of artists, run much into opposite extremes;
<PB N="45" REF="48"/>
and this is generally the fate which eminent men experience in the judgment of their contemporaries: This does not seem to proceed from any want of present capacity to as∣certain the degrees of merit in men, before Time has pronounced upon them with more authority, but is rather owing to the good and evil passions of mankind, to their lik∣ings and their antipathies, to an affectation of singularity, and a vanity to be thought a leader in taste, and a discoverer of latent merit; surprised by these motives into sudden applause, we commit ourselves to it with a warmth which, though it frequently cools, we dare not disavow, and thus become par∣ties

<P><HI>Velasquez.</HI> A grand and cele∣brated piece of history, upon a very large canvas, representing the fa∣mous General Pescara receiving the keys of a Flemish citadel from the Governor of the place; the groupe of Generals, Soldiers, Citi∣zens, Horses, &amp;c. and the striking effect of the town and landscape in the back-ground, all in the most harmonious perspective, have esta∣blished the fame of this noble pic∣ture, in the opinion of judges, as one of the first, if not the very first, production of the master. <HI>Mengs</HI> says decidedly that it is the chef∣d'oeuvre of <HI>Velasquez,</HI> and has pro∣nounced it to be faultless, except in the circumstance of the soldiers' lances, which he criticises as being
<PB N="74" REF="77"/>
too long: Surely this is a very trivial remark, to fall from the pen of so great authority, and, trivial as it is, there is great reason to doubt if it is founded in truth. Af∣ter all, if the painter has enlarged upon the actual height of Pescara's lances for the purpose of effect, who would expect that any eminent critic, after pronouncing the com∣position faultless in every noble part, would seriously state this re∣mark as a single exception? Let us therefore admit, with <HI>Mengs,</HI> that <HI>Velasquez</HI> has taken a wrong mea∣sure of Pescara's lances; but at the same time let us take his word for the perfection of the picture in every other respect. If any lover of the art, who resorts to this col∣lection,
<PB N="75" REF="78"/>
should at the same time dis∣cover that there is one foot in the famous <HI>Pasmo de Sicilia</HI> more than can be accounted for, I hope for his sake it will not abate the rap∣ture he would else receive in the contemplation of such unrivalled compositions.</P>

<P><HI>Raphael.</HI> The celebrated pic∣ture called PASMO DE SICILIA, purchased by Philip the Fourth of the Monks of Palermo, and by him termed <HI>La Joya,</HI> in preference to all others! An annual-rent of one thousand scudi was the price at which the king purchased it of the monks of our Lady dello Spasimo; and hence it got the name of <HI>Pasmo de Sicilia. Vasari,</HI> and the cele∣brated canon of Valencia, <HI>Don Vi∣cente Victoria,</HI> and in late times <HI>Mengs,</HI> have all written largely in testimony of its unrivalled excel∣lence; and there seems a general

concurrence amongst the judges of the art to set it down as the master-piece of Raphael. In my second volume of the Anecdotes of Spanish Painters I have collected several cir∣cumstances relating to this famous picture, and attempted a description of it, which, if the reader is disposed to, refer to will be found in <HI>vol. ii. from page</HI> 172 <HI>to</HI> 182, <HI>inclusive.</HI></P>

<P>This picture, like the <HI>Last Supper</HI> of <HI>Titian</HI> in the Refectory of the Escorial, is the standard work of its master. It was begun in Flanders; enlarged, retouched and finished during his embassy in Spain; no∣thing that his art, genius and in∣dustry

could effect is omitted: In grandeur of design, display of colour∣ing, dignity of character; in com∣position, drawing, perspective, har∣mony, it is a model of excellence: Rubens, in putting his last hand to it, has inserted his own pourtrait amongst the groupe of the Magi; the noblest signature that could be set upon his canvass.</P>

he never draws but with a tragic pencil, and so truly, that he gives the nature itself upon his canvass: In melancholy grace and penitential beauty he is equal to <HI>Guercino;</HI> in anatomical science and muscular correctness he ranks with <HI>Leonardo de Vinci,</HI> and in the sublime and terrible approaches to <HI>Michael An∣gelo.</HI> The examples of his art, which he has left in Spain, if they were generally known, would, I am per∣suaded, warrant what I now venture to say; and for his life and misfor∣tunes, which are very interesting, I beg leave to refer once more to the <HI>Anecdotes, vol. i. page</HI> 197.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<P>I have now gone through the Ca∣talogue of this noble collection; and, as I have reason to think it is the only correct and entire account yet
<PB N="106" REF="109"/>
published, I hope it will be accept∣able to the curious reader. Mengs's remarks only go to a few pictures, and the account of them in the <HI>Viage de Espan̄a,</HI> by <HI>Don Antonio Ponz,</HI> is very far from perfect, though it is a work otherwise replete with in∣teresting information; and, as a ge∣neral directory to travellers in Spain, no book can be better contrived.</P>
<P>If the lovers of the art are curi∣ous to analyze this account, and se∣parate the respective works of the several great masters, they will find it to be a vast collection, which the Spanish monarchs Charles V. Phi∣lip II. III. and IV. amassed within the periods of their reigns: And if we add to this the great collection in the Escorial, that of the Buen-Retiro,
<PB N="107" REF="110"/>
the many fine pictures which were burnt in the Pardo, and some of the most capital which have been discarded in the present reign, the amount will appear prodigious, and, I apprehend, is not to be equalled by any other single collection in Europe.</P>
<P>Of <HI>Titian, Velasquez, Rubens, Mu∣rillo</HI> and <HI>Spagnolet,</HI> I find above one hundred and forty pictures in this sin∣gle Catalogue; forty-three of which are by the hand of <HI>Titian:</HI> I must take the liberty notwithstanding to suggest that this collection would still allow of many draughts to be made; and if these vacancies were filled up from the Buen-Retiro only (not to mention the Escorial) it would be much more perfect.
<PB N="108" REF="111"/>
Some of <HI>Luca Jordano</HI>'s pictures might well be spared; <HI>Corrado</HI>'s sketches, the pourtraits of <HI>Vanlo</HI> and <HI>Ynza,</HI> and some of <HI>Mengs</HI>'s inferior performances, would be well ex∣changed for a select number of <HI>Bas∣san</HI>'s from the old Palace, for a ca∣pital <HI>Lucretia</HI> by <HI>Guido,</HI> which hangs there in obscurity, and many others that might be named.</P>
<P>It is also to be regretted, that <HI>Ve∣lasquez</HI>'s famous picture of Jacob re∣ceiving the bloody Coat of his Son Joseph, and a very fine <HI>Guercino</HI> on the subject of Susanna and the El∣ders, both which now hang in a wretched hole in the Escorial, not appropriated to any sacred uses, should not be removed from thence, and added to the royal collection.</P>
<P><PB N="109" REF="112"/>
Advantageous changes might also be made in the arrangement of the pictures; for in the quarter belong∣ing to the Prince and Princess many capital pictures of <HI>Raphael, Corregio, Leonardo de Vinci, Julio Romano, An∣drea Sacchi, Andrea del Sarto,</HI> and others, are very unfavourably hung; the chamber in which the principal pieces are, being a mean obscure room, filled with lumber, and not in the suite of great apartments: The masters are classed, in general, with∣out much scientific attention to their stiles of colouring; so that the florid pictures oftentimes brow-beat the more tender; and the cold, laboured regularity of Mengs ill contrasts the warm and glowing canvasses of <HI>Ti∣tian, Rubens,</HI> and <HI>Velasquez.</HI> But if
<PB N="110" REF="113"/>
this remark holds good against the sorting of the pictures in this palace, how much more to be lamented is the condition of the capital pictures in the Escorial, where the inimitable <HI>Perla</HI> of <HI>Raphael,</HI> the Holy Family of <HI>Andrea del Sarto,</HI> and the famous <HI>Tintorett</HI> of Christ washing his Disciples' Feet, hang aloft in dust and darkness over the presses that contain the Reliques in the Sacristy, and are almost totally out of sight. This must be painful to every lover of the art, but to the English tra∣veller more than any, who will na∣turally cast a look of pity and af∣fection towards these interesting ob∣jects, once in the possession of an elegant and unhappy monarch, who left them as monuments of his
<PB N="111" REF="114"/>
taste, to be alienated from his crown and nation by an unfeeling crew of fanatics, as barbarous as they were bloody.</P>
<P>It is to be regretted, that so few engravings have been taken from the capital pictures in Spain; I procured all that were to be had, and the col∣lection is very small: Two more may be soon expected by the hand of <HI>Zelma,</HI> an eminent artist; viz. of the <HI>Pasmo de Sicilia</HI> and the <HI>Perla:</HI> The <HI><ABBR>Nra</ABBR> Sen̄ora del pez</HI> has been en∣graved by Bartolozzi. It were greatly to be wished that proper encourage∣ment should be given to our young artists of talents to take drawings of some of these pictures above de∣scribed; in which I am confident they would meet every possible fa∣vour
<PB N="112" REF="115"/>
and protection from the royal owner of the collection. Several pictures might be pointed out in this Catalogue, and elsewhere, which would be admirable subjects, and raise the credit of our artists, already so high in estimation: At the same time that I venture to recommend this undertaking, I am not without some grounds to hope that it is in contemplation.</P>
<P>I should here take notice, that in the above Catalogue no account is taken of the pictures in the apart∣ments of the Infants Don Gabriel; Don Antonio and Don Luis: In the former there are six Sacred Histories by <HI>Luca Jordano,</HI> from passages in the Life of the Virgin Mary; also an Absalom, and a small sketch by
<PB N="113" REF="116"/>
the same hand; two sketches by <HI>Cor∣rado;</HI> a Saint Joseph, with the young Jesus about ten years of age, by <HI>Spagnolet;</HI> a Saint Sebastian and a Magdalen, by the same; Charles V. haranguing his Army, by <HI>Titian;</HI> Or∣pheus harping to the Beasts, by <HI>Ru∣bens;</HI> and a Vulcan, by the same ma∣ster; with a large Flemish painting of Still Life, finely coloured, and capital in its stile.</P>
<P>In the quarter of Don Antonio there are several by <HI>Luca Jordano</HI> on sacred as well as fabulous story: A pourtrait of a Youth in Armour, by <HI>Vandyke;</HI> another of <HI>Carreno,</HI> after <HI>Velasquez;</HI> and a composition, after <HI>Rubens,</HI> on the subject of Moses and Pharaoh's Daughter.</P>
<P><PB N="114" REF="117"/>
In the apartments late appropri∣ated to Don Luis we find the copies which <HI>Rubens</HI> made of <HI>Titian</HI>'s fa∣mous pictures of the Cupids and Bac∣chanals above described, and which <HI>Mengs</HI> so tauntingly compared to a Dutch translation: There are several others of the same master, particu∣larly a Saint George slaying the Dragon, of the size of life, coloured with surprising brilliancy, but in a gaudy stile and flattering. Amongst the works of <HI>Rubens</HI> there is an Ar∣chimedes, a Mercury, Hercules kil∣ling the Hydra, Apollo and Pan, and two pourtraits of Ladies of the House of Medici, with some sketches; two pourtraits by <HI>Vandyke,</HI> one very capital of the Infant Don Ferdinand. There is a Woman, with
<PB N="115" REF="118"/>
several boys, in the manner of <HI>Leo∣nardo de Vinci;</HI> a Scriptural Piece by <HI>Paul Veronese;</HI> a Christ, of the size of life, with the Cross, by <HI>Guido;</HI> a pourtrait of a Woman, by <HI>Titian;</HI> of a Man, by <HI>Vandyke;</HI> and some beautiful Flower-pieces by <HI>Brughel.</HI></P>
<P>Having mentioned some pictures cast out of the royal collection, which I saw in the custody of an artist belonging to the king, it may be proper to observe, that they con∣sist of five capital <HI>Titians;</HI> the first of which is his inestimable <HI>Venus,</HI> once the property of King Charles I. of England, described in the <HI>Anecdotes</HI> (<HI>vol. i. p.</HI> 56.) the greatest model of beauty and perfection in the world: 2. A <HI>Venus and Cupid,</HI> with a Per∣son in the back-ground playing on
<PB N="116" REF="119"/>
an Organ, the Venus recumbent on a couch: 3. A <HI>Venus</HI> of the same size, attitude, &amp;c. with the addition of a little Dog, which she is caress∣ing: 4. A <HI>Venus</HI> in the action of holding back <HI>Adonis</HI> in her embrace, who is setting out for the chace with his dogs, &amp;c. 5. A <HI>Danae,</HI> naked, re∣ceiving the golden shower: There is also a half-length pourtrait of <HI>Ti∣tian,</HI> by his own hand. Besides these, there is a <HI>Venus,</HI> by <HI>Paul Ve∣ronese;</HI> and an <HI>Adonis</HI> and <HI>Cupid,</HI> by <HI>Annibal Caracci;</HI> an <HI>Atalanta</HI> and <HI>Hippomenes</HI> in the Race, by <HI>Guido,</HI> of consummate beauty: The figures are of very tall life, the outline as glittering as <HI>Corregio,</HI> the limbs di∣vinely graceful, and the air of the heads unspeakably elegant and ex∣pressive;
<PB N="117" REF="120"/>
the attitudes perhaps have more of the academy than might be wished, the colouring warmer than his usual hue. Of <HI>Rubens</HI> there are several, and such as would dignify the first collections in Europe; viz. <HI>The Rape of the Sabines; The Baths of Diana;</HI> a <HI>Bacchanalian Tri∣umph,</HI> wherein several Bacchants are plucking fruits, and the figure of Bacchus himself in a capital stile; a <HI>Perseus and Andromeda,</HI> which is a wonderful picture; a group of <HI>Juno, Minerva,</HI> and <HI>Venus; Paris carrying away Helen,</HI> capital; and <HI>The Judg∣ment of Paris,</HI> with the Rival God∣desses, a matchless piece of colour∣ing; all of the size of life, and the very best of the master. There are
<PB N="118" REF="121"/>
also two beautiful pictures by <HI>Al∣bano;</HI> one of them <HI>The Judgment of Paris;</HI> the other a <HI>Venus</HI> coming out of the Bath; and a <HI>Lot and his Daughters,</HI> by <HI>Andrea del Sarto.</HI> I need not observe what an accession these inestimable pictures might be to the collection in the palace.</P>
<P>The royal chapel of the palace is a very beautiful piece of archi∣tecture, supported by vast columns of Biscayan black and white marble, each of one entire block; and in the sacristy and chaplain's room there are several fine pictures by <HI>Spagnolet, Murillo, Luca Jordano, Corrado, Cambiaso, Alonzo Cano,</HI> and other Spanish masters; besides which there is a Descent from the Cross, by <HI>Al∣bert</HI>
<PB N="119" REF="122"/>
<HI>Durer;</HI> and a Conversation-piece of Saint Anthony and Saint Paul the Hermit, by <HI>Andrea Sacchi.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Old Palace of the Buen-Retiro.</HEAD>
<P>In the chamber called <HI>de los Rey∣nos,</HI> there are twelve large Battle-pieces by Spanish masters, and the Labours of Hercules, boldly exe∣cuted by <HI>Francisco Zurbaran.</HI></P>
<P>In the anti-chamber to the queen's apartment there are two large pic∣tures by <HI>Luca Jordano,</HI> some by <HI>Rico</HI> a Neapolitan, and the representation of an Auto de Fé by <HI>Francisco Rizi;</HI> a Roman Triumph, by <HI>Bor∣giani;</HI> and a fine pourtrait of Hen∣ry II. of France, ascribed to <HI>Titian;</HI> also pourtraits of <HI>Ferdinand</HI> and <HI>Isa∣bella.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="120" REF="123"/>
In the chamber of Castrillo a Tantalus and an Ixion, both by <HI>Spagnolet,</HI> colossal, and of striking expression; a view of Saint Peter's in Rome, Saint Mark's Place in Venice, and the Vatican, with the Pope and Cardinals in procession.</P>
<P>In a passage-room leading from this chamber there are some noble pictures of <HI>Snyders, John Tillen,</HI> and <HI>Peter de Vos;</HI> in the Hunting-pieces of <HI>De Vos</HI> there are several persons introduced with wonderful spirit and expression. A capital composition by <HI>Rubens</HI> of Hercules slaying the Hy∣dra; the Queen Mother of Charles II. of Spain; two full-lengths of Charles V. by <HI>Juan Pantoia de la Cruz;</HI> two of Philip IV. of different ages; and one of a Buffoon, in the
<PB N="121" REF="124"/>
stile of <HI>Velasquez;</HI> several Sacred Histories, finely executed by Bassan, and some by <HI>Estevan Marc.</HI></P>
<P>In a large room adjoining are two grand Historical Compositions by <HI>Pedro de Cortona,</HI> in both which he has introduced Pope Urban VIII. with his Cardinals, and views of the Vatican; two small compositions on the subject of Diana, by <HI>Titian,</HI> painted in his latter age; a Mercury and Argos, by <HI>Jordaens,</HI> and several excellent <HI>Bassans,</HI> and some land∣scapes by <HI>Marc.</HI></P>
<P>In the Court-room many pic∣tures by <HI>Luca Jordano;</HI> a large Bac∣chanalian piece, by <HI>Cornelius de Vos;</HI> a large Fruit-piece, of unparalleled execution and variety, representing
<PB N="122" REF="125"/>
the Golden Age, by <HI>Adrian Van Utrecht,</HI> with nine figures of the School of <HI>Rubens;</HI> also another ad∣mirable piece of Fruits, Birds, &amp;c. to which <HI>Van Utrecht</HI> has set his name and the date of the year 1642; Orpheus redeeming Eurydice from Hell, by <HI>Rubens;</HI> a capital Land∣scape, signed with the Name of <HI>Jor∣daens,</HI> in which he has represented Vertumnus and Pomona, naked figures.</P>
<P>In a small room next to this some copies by <HI>Luca Jordano,</HI> and a su∣perb picture by <HI>Rubens,</HI> representing the Fall of the Giants; a Saturn de∣vouring a Child, by the same. A fine composition, by <HI>Nicholas Poussin,</HI> with an Amphitheatre, and many
<PB N="123" REF="126"/>
figures, amongst which are four Ele∣phants; and several other pictures, which I forbear to enumerate.</P>
<P>In one of the private chapels there is a fine Altar-piece by <HI>Vasari,</HI> with the Holy Family at full-length, admirably executed; other pictures by <HI>Luca Jordano</HI> and the Spanish masters.</P>
<P>In the passage to this chapel hangs an original drawing, by <HI>Raphael,</HI> of his famous Battle-piece of Constan∣tine and Maxentius, now in the Va∣tican; an exquisite <HI>Parmegiano</HI> of the Espousals of Christ with Saint Catherine; the Centurion at the Feet of our Saviour, a fine picture by <HI>Paul Veronese;</HI> a grand Head of Saint Jerom, by <HI>Guido;</HI> the four Evangelists, by <HI>Rubens;</HI> and sketches
<PB N="124" REF="127"/>
of the famous pictures he made for the Convent of Loeches, by com∣mission from Olivarez; some heads of Martyrs by <HI>Spagnolet;</HI> several pictures by <HI>Corrado,</HI> and a very fine composition by <HI>Marc.</HI> All these va∣luable pieces are buried in a dark lobby, and every spectator, who has a feeling for merit in obscurity, will regard them with a mixture of ad∣miration and regret.</P>
<P>In the apartments of the Infants we again meet with several very fine Scriptural Histories, by <HI>Bassan,</HI> in a stile superior to any thing I have elsewhere seen of that master; some landscapes by <HI>Claud Lorrain,</HI> several large compositions by <HI>Sneyder,</HI> and a variety of pictures of the Spanish School.</P>
<P><PB N="125" REF="128"/>
In the passage to this apartment many curious pieces will be found; amongst them a Saint J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>es, by <HI>Paul Veronese,</HI> very fine; a beautiful Ver∣tumnus and Pomona, by <HI>Rubens;</HI> a half-length of a Woman with a basket on her arm, by <HI>Spagnolet;</HI> a Saint Francis, by the same; some excellent pourtraits by <HI>Leonardo de Vinci,</HI> and other old masters; a Boy and an old Woman, a candle-light, very capital, by <HI>Rembrandt;</HI> Pilate washing his Hands, by <HI>Guercino,</HI> a noble picture; and a Sacrifice to Po∣mona, exquisitely finished, by <HI>Jacobo Jordaeno.</HI></P>
<P>In a room adjoining there is a great collection of <HI>Sneyders, Bassan, Golze, Bosco, Dominichino, Francisco Perez, Luca Jordano,</HI> and others.</P>
<P><PB N="126" REF="129"/>
A Lucretia by <HI>Guido,</HI> full length, of the size of life, in the act of self-destruction; a matchless picture, that would dignify the first collection in Europe.</P>
<P>In this deserted palace are to be seen the celebrated frescos of <HI>Luca Jordano,</HI> supposed to be the very best of the master: The climate at least has been favourable to them, for they are in fresh and perfect pre∣servation.</P>
<P>In the queen's chamber are some incomparable performances of <HI>Gas∣par Poussin;</HI> a Firework in the Spa∣nish Square at Rome, finely painted by <HI>Sebastian Conca;</HI> an Herodias, by <HI>Caravagio;</HI> a Hercules, by <HI>Caesar Tracarzane,</HI> and many others worth attention.</P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="130"/>
There is a grand sketch of <HI>Tinio∣rett</HI>'s famous Last Supper, in the quarter of the late Infant Don Luis; some fine <HI>Spagnolets,</HI> and two very curious Histories of Adam and Eve, the size of life, signed as fol∣lows, <HI>Albertus Durerus Almanus fa∣ciebat post Virginis partum</HI> 1507.</P>
<P>The Theatre, though now in dis∣use, is extremely fine, and so con∣trived as to admit of the whole back scene to be occasionally drawn off, and laid open to the garden: The paintings are by <HI>Amiconi.</HI></P>
<P>From this imperfect account of the paintings in this deserted palace, it will readily be acknowledged, that it still contains a very respect∣able collection, and that a superb gallery might be furnished by
<PB N="128" REF="131"/>
draughts of the capital pictures still remaining in it.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<P>In the little suburban palace, called <HI>The Caso del Càmpo,</HI> are some curious Caprichios of the noted <HI>Ja∣cobo Calot,</HI> representing the Temp∣tations of St. Anthony, and an alle∣gorical invention of <HI>Geronimo Bosch,</HI> which in wildness of idea exceeds every thing that ever fell from the pencil of an artist: The design is the Creation of Man, and the state to which his nature may be reduced by vice, the painter having described the human passions by a vast multi∣tude of symbolical figures of Birds, Beasts, and monstrous compounds. The conceits of this moral and sa∣tyrical humourist are infinite; a man of curiosity may amuse a leisure hour
<PB N="129" REF="132"/>
in the examination of them, but I am persuaded the reader will readily excuse me from attempting to de∣scribe them.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<P>The churches and convents of Madrid are possessed of very many fine paintings, and it is in them the works of the Spanish masters will be found in the greatest number and perfection: Several of them, how∣ever, contain very capital produc∣tions of the best Italian painters, and in particular the Convent of San Pasqual on the Prado, to which Cabrera, great admiral of Castile, bequeathed his whole valuable col∣lection. There is a large Altar-piece by <HI>Guercino,</HI> superlatively fine, and several capital paintings on the
<PB N="130" REF="133"/>
altars and in the sacristy, by <HI>Jacobo Palma, Leonardo de Vinci, Titian, Andrea Schiavone, Paul Veronese, Guercino, Vandyke, Bassan, Luca Jor∣dano</HI> and <HI>Spagnolet.</HI> A lover of the art must not omit to visit the Con∣vent of San Placido, if it were only for the purpose of contemplating that wonderful picture of the Dead Christ on the Cross, painted by Ve∣lasquez in the year 1638; though he will find further gratification for his curiosity in the same convent, which possesses two of the very best pictures which <HI>Claudio Coello</HI> ever composed.</P>
<P>As these churches and convents are very numerous, the research would be much too intricate and la∣borious without a clue; but this will
<PB N="131" REF="134"/>
be so readily had in the <HI>Viage de Espana</HI> before mentioned, that a tra∣veller has only to provide himself with those volumes, and he will there find an excellent guide for his curiosity.</P>
