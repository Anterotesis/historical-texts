<HEAD>SECTION I. Of the Progress of AMIR TIMUR, or TAMERLANE, in
Hindostan.</HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1397. Higerah 800.</NOTE><NOTE PLACE="marg">Tamerlane invades Hindostan.</NOTE>AMIR TIMUR, being informed of
the commotions and civil wars of Hindostan, began his expedition into that
country, in the eight hundredth year of the Higerah, and, on the twelfth of
Mohirrim, in the following year, arrived on the banks of the Chule Jallali<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A river on the frontiers of Hindostan.</NOTE>. He
immediately dispatched Amir Shech Noor ul Dien to dispossess Shab ul
Dien Mubarick, who had, in charge, the defence of the frontier districts.
When Shech Noor <PB N="2" REF="7"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1397. Hig. 800.</NOTE>ul Dien had arrived
within a few miles of Shab ul Dien Mubarick, he summoned him to submit to
Timur. But as the imperial general had previously retreated into a strong
hold, on the bank of the river, round which he had drawn a ditch, forming the
place into an island, he determined to defend himself to the last.</P>
<P>Shech Noor ul Dien, however, found means, upon making his
approaches, to fill up the ditch: but at night he suffered a consi∣derable
loss, by a violent sally of the besieged; whom, in the end, he
repulsed, and forced to take shelter within their walls. Amir Timur
himself advanced against the enemy, with his whole army. Shab ul Dien
intimidated, by the approach of Timur, stowed pri∣vately, in forty boats, his
treasure and family, and fell down the river, being two days pursued in
vain, by Shech Noor ul Dien, who was detached with a party after him. The
garrison, after the departure of their leader, immediately surrendered.</P>
<P>Amir Timur proceeded down the river to the conflux of the Jimboo
and Chinab, where there was a strong fort and town, known by the name of
Tulmubini. He ordered a bridge to be laid across, by which his army might
pass. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tamerlane lays Tulmu∣bini under
contribution.</NOTE>Having pitched his camp, without the town, he laid it under
a heavy contribution. But whilst the inhabitants were very busy in
collecting the sum demanded, a complaint being made in the camp, of the
scarcity of provisions, orders were issued to seize grain wherever it
should be found. The soldiers, upon this, hastened to search the town,
but not being content to take provisions alone, the natural con∣sequence
was, that a general plunder ensued. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The inhabi∣tants massa∣cred.</NOTE>The
inhabitants, endeavouring to oppose this outrage, were massacred without
mercy.</P>
<P>To besiege the citadel would but retard the designs of Timur.
He therefore marched, the next day after the massacre, to a town called
Shawnawaze, where he found more grain than was suffi∣cient <PB N="3" REF="8"/>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1397. Hig. 800.</NOTE>to serve his whole
army. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Shawnawaze pillaged.</NOTE>He therefore ordered,
that what could not be carried away should be burnt; having previously cut
off Jisserit, the brother of Shuha Giker, who had attempted to defend the
place with two thousand men. Timur marched, on the third day, from
Shawnawaze, and, crossing the Bea, came into a rich and plentiful
country.</P>
<P>It may not be improper here to say something concerning the
proceedings of Mirza Pier Mahummud, after his having, as has been already
mentioned, taken Moultan. The Solstitial rains hav∣ing destroyed a great
part of his cavalry, in the field, he was under the necessity of drawing
his army into the city of Moultan. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mirza Pier Mahummud blockaded in
Moultan.</NOTE>There he was driven to the utmost distress by the
inhabitants of the country, who had closely invested him. His cavalry,
instead of being able to act against them, diminished daily in their
numbers, for want of forage.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Is relieved by Timur.</NOTE>In this untoward
situation were the affairs of that prince, when his grandfather, Amir Timur,
entered Hindostan, who immediately reinforced Mahummud with a detachment of
thirty thousand chosen horse, and soon joined him with his whole army.
The prince carried in his mind great animosity against the governor of
Bat∣tenize, who had chiefly distressed him. Amir Timur himself, to
chastise the governor, selected ten thousand horse, with which he
marched directly towards him. When he reached Adjodin, he was shewn the tomb
of Shech Ferid Shuckergunge, the poet, in respect to whose memory he
spared the few inhabitants who remained in the place, the greater part having
fled to Delhi and Battenize.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">who
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> at Battenize.</NOTE>Timur
continued then his march to Battenize, crossing the river of Adjodin, and
encamping at Chaliskole, from which place, in one day, he marched fifty
crores to Battenize. Upon his arrival, the people of Debalpoor, and other
adjacent towns, crowded into <PB N="4" REF="9"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1397. Hig. 800.</NOTE>the place, in such
numbers, that half of them were driven out, and obliged to take shelter under
the walls. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">and invests it.</NOTE>They were there
attacked, the first day, by the king, and some thousands of them slain.
Raw Chillige, who was governor of the place, seeing the enemy so few in
number, drew out the garrison, and formed them without the town, in order of
battle. The Moguls, how∣ever, upon the first onset, drove him back within
his walls, while the king himself pressed so hard upon the enemy's
rear, that he possessed himself of the gates before they could be
shut. Then driving the runaways from street to street, he became, in a
few hours, intirely master of the place, except the citadel; to reduce which,
he ordered a party immediately to dismount, and begin to undermine it.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The city taken.</NOTE>The garrison desired
to capitulate, to which Timur agreed; and the governor, having had an interview
with the king, presented him with three hundred Arabian horses, and with
many of the va∣luable curiosities of Hindostan. Timur, in return, honoured
him with a chelat; and after the conditions were settled, sent Amir
So∣liman, Sheh, and Omar Ulla, to take possession of the gates,
com∣manding them to slay all those who had taken refuge in the place, and
had before been active against his grandson Mirza Pier Mahum∣mud. The
rest, after being plundered, were ordered to be dis∣missed.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">and the inha∣bitants put to the
sword.</NOTE>In consequence of this inhuman order, five hundred persons,
in a few minutes, were put to death. Those who remained still within the
sort, were so struck with this massacre, that they set fire to the
place, murdered their wives and children, and, in mere despair, sought
after nothing but revenge and death. The scene now became terrible indeed!
but the unfortunate inhabitants were, in the end, cut off to a man; they
however revenged themselves amply, upon the rapacious and inhuman authors of
their distress; some thou∣sands <PB N="5" REF="10"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1397. Hig. 800.</NOTE>of the Moguls,
having fallen by their hands. This so much exasperated Amir Timur, that
firebrand of the world, that he or∣dered every soul in Battenize to be
massacred, and to reduce the city itself to ashes.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Several cities taken by Ti∣mur, and the
inhabitants massacred.</NOTE>Timur, marching to Surusti, put the
inhabitants of that place, also, to the sword, and gave the town up to
pillage. Advancing to Fatteabad, he continued the same scene of barbarity,
through that, and the adjacent towns of Rahib, Amirani, and Jonah. He de∣tached
Hakîm Agherâck towards Sammana, with five thousand horse, and
with the few that remained, he himself scoured the country, and cut off a
tribe of banditti called Jits, who had lived for some years by rapine. His
army, in the mean time, being di∣vided under different chiefs, carried fire and
sword through all the provinces of Moultan and Lahore, but when they
advanced, near the capital, he ordered a general rendezvous at Keitil, a town
with∣in five crores of Sammana.</P>
<P>Timur himself soon joined his army, and having regulated the
order of his march, advanced towards Delhi. When he reached Panniput, he
ordered his soldiers to put on their fighting apparel<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Coats stuffed thick with cotton, worn instead of
armour.</NOTE>; and, that he might be the better supplied with forage,
crossed the Jumna, took the fort of Lowni by assault, and put the
garrison to the sword. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Arrives be∣fore Delhi,</NOTE>He then marched
down along the river, and encamped opposite to the citadel of Delhi,
posting guards to prevent all com∣munication. He immediately detached Amir
Soliman Shaw, and Amir Jehan Shaw, to scour the country behind him to the
south and south east of the city; 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">which he re∣connoitres.</NOTE>whilst he
himself that very day, with seven hundred horse only, crossed the
river to reconnoitre the citadel.</P>
<P>Mahmood Shaw and Mullu Eckbal Chan, seeing so few in the
retinue of Timur, issued forth with five thousand foot and twenty-seven
<PB N="6" REF="11"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1397. Hig. 800.</NOTE>elephants against
him. Mahummud Sillif, an Omrah of repute in Delhi, who led on the attack, was
repulsed and taken prisoner by the Moguls. Timur ordered him to be
immediately beheaded, and after having made the observations which he
design∣ed, repassed the river and joined his army.</P>
<P>He next morning moved his camp more to the eastward, where he
was told, by the princes and generals of his army, that there were then above
one hundred thousand prisoners in his camp, who had been taken since he
crossed the Sind; that these unfortunate persons had, the day before,
expressed great joy, when they saw him attacked before the citadel; which
rendered it extremely pro∣bable, that, on a day of battle, they would join with
their country∣men against him. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">He massacres 100,000 pri∣soners in cold
blood.</NOTE>The inhuman Timur, who might have found other means of prevention,
gave orders to put all above the age of fifteen to the sword, so that, upon
that horrid day, one hundred thousand men were massacred, in cold blood.
This barbarity, to∣gether with his other actions of equal cruelty, gained him
the name of Hillâk Chan, or the destroying Prince.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Crosses the Jumna,</NOTE>Upon the fifth of
Jemmad ul Awil, Timur forded the river with his army without opposition, and
encamped on the plains of Firo∣seabad; where he entrenched himself, filling
the ditch with buffa∣loes fronting the enemy, whom he fastened with ropes and
picquets to their stations, placing, at the same time, strong guards, at
proper distances, behind them.</P>
<P>Though the astrologers pronounced the seventh an unlucky day,
the king marched out of his lines, and drew up his army in order of battle.
Sultan Mamood and Mullu Eckbal Chan, with the ar∣my of Delhi, and one hundred
and twenty elephants in mail, ad∣vanced towards him. But upon the very first
charge of a squa∣dron, called the Heroes of Chighitta, the elephant-drivers
were dis∣mounted, <PB N="7" REF="12"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1397. Hig. 800.</NOTE>and the outrageous
animals, deprived of their guides, ran roaring back, and spread terror and
confusion among their own ranks. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">totally de∣feats the enemy.</NOTE>The veteran
troops of Timur, who had already conquered half the world, improved this
advantage, and the degenerate Hin∣doos were, in a few minutes, totally routed,
without making one brave effort for their country, lives, and fortunes. The
conqueror pursued them, with great slaughter, to the very gates of Delhi,
near which he fixed his quarters.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">who desert the city.</NOTE>The
consternation of the fugitives was so great, that, not trust∣ing to their
walls, Sultan Mamood and Mullu Eckbal Chan, de∣serted, in the night, their
capital; the former flying to Guzerat, the latter taking the route of Berren.
Timur, having intelligence of their flight, detached parties after them, one of
which coming up with Sultan Mamood, killed a great number of his retinue, and
took his two infant sons, Seif ul Dien and Choda Daad, prisoners. Timur
received the submission of all the great men of the city, who crowded to
his camp, and were promised protection upon paying great contributions; and,
upon the Friday following, he ordered the Chutba in all the mosques, to be
read in his own name. Upon the sixteenth of the same month he placed guards
at the gates, and appointed the scriviners of the city, and magistrates, to
regulate the contribution according to the wealth and rank of the inhabitants.
Information was, in the mean time, lodged, that several omrahs and rich men
had shut themselves up in their houses, with their de∣pendents, and
refused to pay down their share of the ransom. This obliged Timur Shaw to
send troops into the city, to enforce the au∣thority of the magistrates. A
general confusion, uproar, and plun∣dering, immediately ensued, which could
not be restrained by the Mogul officers, who, at the same time, durst not
acquaint the king that their authority was contemned by the troops.</P>
<P> <PB N="8" REF="13"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1397. Hig. 800.</NOTE>Timur was then
busy in his camp, in celebrating a grand festival, on account of his
victory, so that it was five days before he received any intelligence of
these proceedings. The first notice he had of them, was by the flames of
the city; for the Hindoos, according to their manner, seeing their wives and
daughters ravished and pol∣luted, their wealth seized by the hand of
rapine, and they them∣selves insulted, beat, and abused, at length, by
one consent, shut the city gates, set fire to their houses, murthered
their wives and children, and ran out like madmen against their enemies.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A general massacre.</NOTE>But little effect
had the despair of the unfortunate upon the Mo∣guls, who soon collected
themselves, and began a general massacre. Some streets were rendered
impassable, by the heaps of dead; and, in the mean time, the gates being
forced, the whole Mogul army were admitted. Then followed a scene of horror,
much easier to be imagined than described.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The unparal∣leled misfor∣tunes of the
Delhians.</NOTE>The desperate courage of the unfortunate Delhians, was at
length cooled in their own blood. They threw down their weapons, they
submitted themselves like sheep to the slaughter. They permitted one
man to drive a hundred of them prisoners before him; so that we may plainly
perceive, that cowardice is the mother of despair. In the city the Hindoos
were, at least, ten to one, superior in num∣ber to the enemy, and had they
possessed souls, it would have been impossible for the Moguls,
who were scattered about in every street, house, and corner, laden with
plunder, to have resisted the dreadful assault. But though the Hindoos
had the savage resolution of im∣b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ing their hands in the blood of their wives and children, we find
them still the slaves of fear, and shrinking at the approach of that
death, which they could so readily execute upon others.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Nizam ul Dien ac∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>nt of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in Delhi.</NOTE>This massacre is, in the History of Nizam ul
Dien Ahmud, other∣wise related. The collectors of the ransom, says he,
upon the part <PB N="9" REF="14"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1397. Hig. 800.</NOTE>of Timur, having
used great violence, by torture and other means, to extort money, the
citizens fell upon them, and killed some of the Moguls. This circumstance
being reported to the Mogul king, he ordered a general pillage, and, upon
resistance, a massacre to com∣mence. This account carries greater
appearance of truth along with it, both from Timur's general character of
cruelty, and the improbability of his being five days close to the city
without having intelligence of what passed within the walls.</P>
<P>But the race of the Mogul prince take, to this day, great pains to
invalidate this opinion, nor do they want arguments upon their side. The
principal one is this, that, in consequence of a general plunder, the king
would have been deprived of the ransom, which must have been exceedingly
great, and for which he only received the elephants and regalia. Neither have
we any account of his taking any part of the plunder from his army afterwards,
though it must have been very immense.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Timur enters Delhi.</NOTE>The king, after this
horrid scene, entered the city, taking to himself one hundred and twenty
elephants, twelve rhinoceroses, and a number of curious animals, that had
been collected by Firose Shaw. The fine mosque, built by that prince, upon
the stones of which he had inscribed the history of his reign, being
esteemed a master-piece of architecture and taste, took so much the
fancy of the conqueror, that he ordered stone-cutters and masons from Delhi
to Samarcand, to build one upon the same plan.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Resolves to return. Marches to
Firoseabad,</NOTE>After having stayed fifteen days at Delhi, Timur took a
sudden resolution of returning, and he accordingly marched out to
Firo∣seabad, whither Bahadre Nahir sent him two white parrots, as
cu∣riosities from Mewat, with prosessions of subjection. The king
sent Seid Shumse ul Dien Turmuzi to bring him to the presence, which 
<PB N="10" REF="15"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1397. Hig. 800.</NOTE>summons he
immediately obeyed; and Chizer Chan, who had lain concealed in the hills,
presented himself at court, and was fa∣vorably received.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">and to Pani∣put.</NOTE>The king marching from
Firoseabad arrived at Paniput, from whence he detached Amir Shaw Malluk, to
besiege Merat, a strong fort, situated between the rivers, about thirty
crores from Delhi. When Amir Shaw Malluk reached the place, upon reconnoitring
its strength, and finding the garrison determined to defend it, he
mentioned in a letter to the king, that they insulted him from the walls, by
telling him he could succeed no better than Tirrim Seri Chan, the Mogul
Prince, who had formerly attempted to take the place.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Besieges and takes Merat.</NOTE>This had the
desired effect upon the king, who immediately marched his army against
Merat, and, without delay, began to sink his mines, and carry on his
approaches; advancing his sap towards the walls, at the rate of fifteen yards
every twenty-four hours. Elias Adyhuni, the son of Moluna, Ahmud Jannasure,
and Mulleck Suffi Kebire, defended the place with great resolution. But the
Moguls having filled up the ditch, placed their scaling lad∣ders, and
fastened their hook-ropes to the wall, in spite of all op∣position; and,
without waiting for a breach, by means of the mines, stormed the place, and
put every soul within it to the sword. The mines, however, being
finished, the king ordered them to be sprung, which blew the walls and
bastions into pieces.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">His progress towards the
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the Ganges.</NOTE>Timur
continued his march to the skirts of the mountains of Sewalic, marking his
way with fire and sword. Crossing, then, the Ganges, he subdued the
country as high as where the river issues from the mountains; returning
from thence, he repassed the river, and marched through the hills, where he
was opposed by a zemindar called Zein Dund, whom he defeated and plundered. 
<PB N="11" REF="16"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1397. Hig. 800.</NOTE>He then continued
his rout, taking several small forts in his way; having arrived at
Jimmugur, he fought the raja of that place, who was wounded, taken, and forced
to become a Mussulman.</P>
<P>Jisserit, the brother of Shuha Gicker, who had fled to him
after his being defeated by Timur Shaw, had by his brother been severely
reprimanded for opposing the king; which having been represented to Timur,
Shuha Gicker was admitted into his presence, and became a great favorite. But
when the king had marched on to Delhi, he remembered not his obedience, and in
the absence of Ti∣mur possessed himself of Lahore. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Shuha Gic∣ker refuses to submit to Timur.
Timur takes Lahore.</NOTE>The king having returned to Jimbo<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A fort in Punjaab, three days journey north of Lahore.</NOTE>,
Shuha Gicker refused to submit to his authority. The sultan sent part
of his army to besiege Shuha Gicker in Lahore, which being taken in a few
days, he was brought prisoner to the king, who ordered him to be instantly
beheaded.</P>
<P>We do not find that Timur appointed any king to govern
Hin∣dostan, which he had in a great measure subdued. He, however,
confirmed the subas, who had submitted to him, in their govern∣ments; and,
from this circumstance, we may suppose, that he in∣tended to retain the
empire in his own name; though he left no troops behind him, except a small
detachment in Delhi, to secure it from further depredations. While he
remained at Jimbo, he appointed Chizer Chan viceroy of Moultan, Lahore, and
Dibalpoor, then proceeded, by the way of Cabul, to Samurcand.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION II. The conclusion of the reign of MAHMOOD
SHAW.</HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1397. Hig. 800.</NOTE>THE city of Delhi
had remained in anarchy for the space of two months, when it was taken
possession of by Nuserit Shaw, with only two thousand horse, from
Merat. Shab Chan and Mal∣leck Almass, with their troops and ten elephants,
joined him soon after from the same place; Nuserit Shaw sent
immediately Shab Chan, with his troops, towards Birren, against Eckbal Chan,
who had there taken up his residence. But Shab Chan was attacked, in the
night, upon his march, by the zemindars in the interest of Eckbal Chan, and
slain; Eckbal Chan pursuing this advantage, took all the baggage of Shab
Chan's army.</P>
<P>This success raising the reputation as well as spirits of
Eckbal Chan, he, in a few days, thought himself in a condition to at∣tempt
the capital, which he did with success; for Nuserit Shaw, upon his
approach, fled to Merat; 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Eckbal Chan recovers Delhi.</NOTE>and Eckbal
Chan resumed the administration of affairs in the ruined city. The
inhabitants, who had fled to different places, having still a natural
hankering after their old abode, began to assemble again, and the place, in
a short time, put on the appearance of populousness, especially the
quarter called the New City.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1399. Hig. 802</NOTE>Eckbal Chan
possessed himself soon of the country between the two rivers,
which, with a small district round the city, was all that now held of the
capital. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Subahs revolt from the empire.</NOTE>The
subas had rendered themselves inde∣pendent, in their own governments,
during the misfortunes and confusion of the empire. Guzerat was seized upon
by Chan Azim Ziffer Chan;—Malava by Delawir Chan;—Kinnoge, Oud,
Kur∣rah, and Jionpoor, by Sultan ul Shirk Chaja Jehan;—Lahore,
Di∣balpoor, <PB N="13" REF="20"/>

Chizer Chan;—Sammana by Ghalil Chan;—Beana by Shumse
Chan;—Mahoba by Mahummud Chan ben Malleck Zadda Firose; and so on
with regard to the other pro∣vinces, the governors asserting their own
independence, and stiling themselves kings.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1400. Hig. 803.</NOTE><NOTE PLACE="marg">Eckbal Chan defeats Shumse Chan.</NOTE>In the month of Jemmad ul
Awil, 803, Eckbal Chan marched with an army from Delhi towards Biana, and
defeated Shumse Chan; whose troops joining him, he proceeded to Kittar, and
after having levied a great contribution upon the territory of Narsingh,
returned to Delhi. Intelligence was soon after brought him, that Chaja Jehan
was dead at Jionpoor, and that his adopted son, Kir∣rinphil, having
assumed the title of Sultan Mubarick Shaw, held that government. Eckbal
Chan being in alliance with Shumse Chan, governor of Biana, Mubarick Chan and
Bahadre Nahir of Mewat, marched the same year against Kirrinphil.</P>
<P>When he had reached the village of Pattiali, upon the banks of the
Ganges, Rai Sere, and all the zemindars of that country, op∣posed him; but he
defeated them, with great slaughter. After this victory, he marched to
Kinnoge, with an intention to proceed to Jionpoor, and from thence to
Lucknouti. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Frustrated in his designs upon the pro∣vince
of Jou∣poor.</NOTE>Upon his march, how∣ever, he was met by Mubarick Shaw, who
opposed his crossing the Ganges so effectually, that, after repeated
efforts for two months, he was forced to abandon the undertaking, and to return
to his own country. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1401. Hig. 804.</NOTE><NOTE PLACE="marg">His persidy.</NOTE>But the perfidious Eckbal, entertaining
some groundless suspicions of Shumse Chan and Mubarick Chan,
assassinated them both upon their way back to their own
governments.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Sultan Mah∣mood returns to Delhi.</NOTE>Sultan
Mahmood Shaw, in the year 804, being disgusted with Ziffer Chan at Guzerat,
fled from him to Malava, and soon after, by the invitation of Eckbal Chan,
returned to Delhi. He, how∣ever, contented himself with a pension, fearing
that his interfering <PB N="14" REF="21"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1401. Hig. 804.</NOTE>in the government
would prove fatal to him. Advice being arrived, that Mubarick Shaw was dead, at
Jionpoor, Eckbal Chan, taking along with him Sultan Mahmood, marched again
towards Kin∣noge; upon which Sultan Ibrahim, the brother of Mubarick Shaw, who
had mounted the throne, advanced with the troops of the East to meet him.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">His folly.</NOTE>When the armies were near one
another, Sultan Mahmood, dissa∣tisfied with his condition, and having the
folly to imagine that Sultan Ibrahim would acknowledge him king, and abdicate
the throne for his sake, escaped, one day, when he was out hunting, to the
army of Ibrahim. But when that prince learned the intentions of Mah∣mood, he
even with-held from him the necessaries of life, and inti∣mated to him to
quit the camp. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Made gover∣nor of Kin∣noge.</NOTE>Sultan Mahmood
returned, in great distress, to Kinnoge, and was left, by Eckbal Chan, in
the government of that city; the governor, who was formerly there on the part
of Sultan Ibrahim, being driven out. Ibrahim, however, put up with this
insult, and returned to Jionpoor, while Eckbal Chan retired to Delhi.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1402. Hig. 805.</NOTE><NOTE PLACE="marg">Eckbal Chan marches a∣gainst Gua∣lier,</NOTE>In the year 805,
Eckbal Chan marched against Gualier, which had fallen into the hands of
Narsing, during the invasion of Timur, and had now, upon Narsing's death,
descended to his son, Byram Deo Rajaput. The fort being very strong, he
could effect no∣thing against it, but plundering the district around, he
returned to Delhi. Brooking ill, however, this disappointment, he, in a
short time, marched a second time against Gualier. Byram Deo sallied
out of the place, and engaged Eckbal Chan, but he was soon driven back into
the fort, the siege of which Eckbal Chan was again obliged to raise; and
having plundered the country as before, he returned to Delhi.</P>
<P> <PB N="15" REF="22"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1404. Hig. 807.</NOTE><NOTE PLACE="marg">Atava,</NOTE>Eckbal Chan, in the year 807, drew his army towards
Atava, and having, in several battles, defeated Rai Sibbiri, Rai Gualier, Rai
Jallar, and others, who possessed that country, he raised
con∣tributions there. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">and Kinnoge.</NOTE>He then turned his arms
against Sultan Mah∣mood, in Kinnoge. The Sultan shut himself up in the
city, and Eckbal Chan invested it for some time, but, not being able to
reduce the place, he raised the siege, and marched towards Sam∣mana.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Byram Chan.</NOTE>Byram Chan, a descendant of
one of the Turkish slaves of Firose Shaw, had fixed himself in Sammana,
and, upon the approach of Eckbal Chan, had fled to the hills of Budhoor; Eckbal
closely pursuing him, encamped at the skirts of the mountains. Seid Alim
ul Dien came to mediate matters, and a peace was soon patched up between the
contending parties, and both joining their forces together, marched towards
Moultan, against Chizer Chan. At Tilbundi they were opposed by Rai Daood,
Camal Mai, and Rai Hubbu, who were defeated and taken prisoners. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">is flay'd alive.</NOTE>The perfidi∣ous Eckbal
Chan, after this victory, without any apparent reason, except a desire of
aggrandizing himself, seized upon Byram Chan, and ordered him to be flay'd
alive.</P>
<P>The death of Byram did not remain long unrevenged. Eckbal arriving
near Adjodin, Chizer Chan met him, with the troops of Moultan, Punjaab, and
Dibalpoor, and, upon the nineteenth of Jemad ul Awil the two armies engaged;

<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pursued by Sultan Ibra∣him.</NOTE>Sultan
Ibrahim marched against him, and, after some skirmishes, obliged him to
retreat to Delhi. The Sultan's spiritless behaviour lost him the
affections of his troops, and they accordingly, with one consent,
dispersed themselves.</P>
<P>Sultan Ibrahim, having received intelligence of this desertion,
crossed the Ganges, and marched towards Delhi, with great ex∣pedition. When
he had reached the banks of the Jumna, he heard that Chan Azim Ziffer Chan of
Guzerat, had taken Alip Chan, Suba of Mindu, and the country of Malava, and was
then upon his march towards Jionpoor. Upon which he immediately re∣treated, to
cover the capital of his dominions.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1407. Hig. 810.</NOTE><NOTE PLACE="marg">Byram Chan defeated by Lodi.</NOTE>In the month of Rigib, 810,
Dowlat Chan Lodi and Byram Chan, the Turk, came to battle near Sammana. Byram
Chan was defeated, and surrendered himself to Dowlat Chan; but be∣fore the
latter had enjoyed any fruits of his victory, he was him∣self beat back to
Delhi, by Chizer Chan. Sultan Mahmood, in the following year, marched against
Keiwan Chan, who, upon the part of Chizer Chan, commanded the fort of Firosa.
The Sultan, after levying contributions, returned; 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Sultan besieged in Feroseabad.</NOTE>and
Chizer Chan, upon advice of these transactions, marched against Delhi,
and be∣sieged Sultan Mahmood, who was neither a warrior nor a politician, in
Firoseabad. But fortune, for this time, supplied the want of abi∣lities in
Mahmood, for Chizer Chan being in want of forage and grain, was obliged to
raise the siege, and retire to Fattipoor.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A D. 1411. Hig. 814.</NOTE><NOTE PLACE="marg">Chizer Chan besieges Mahmood in Delhi.</NOTE>Chizer Chan, in the
beginning of the year 814, returned by the way of Rhotuck, a country then in
the possession of Sultan Mah∣mood, where Malleck Ecteriz and Mubariz

town of Nar∣noul, <PB N="17" REF="24"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1413. Hig. 816.</NOTE>and again advanced
to Delhi; Mahmood Shaw shut him∣self up in the old citadel of Seri, which
Chizer Chan immediately besieged. Achtiar Chan, who commanded in
Firoseabad, seeing the affairs of Mahmood in a desperate situation,
joined himself to Chi∣zer Chan, and admitted him into the place. They then,
with all their troops, took possession of the country on the opposite
side of the river, and prevented all supplies from Sultan Mahmood.</P>
<P>But that famine which they designed for the Sultan and his
ad∣herents, recoiled upon themselves; for a great drought had occa∣sioned a
scarcity of provisions between the rivers, and in the neigh∣bourhood of
Delhi; 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">But retires.</NOTE>insomuch that Chizer Chan
was, a second time, forced to raise the siege, and retire to Fattipoor.
Mahmood Shaw being delivered from this imminent danger, took no pains to
strengthen himself against a future attack. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mahmood dies.</NOTE>He took the diversion of
hunting in the neighbourhood of Keitul, where he was seized with a fever, and
died in the month of Zecada; and with him the empire of Delhi fell from the
race of the Turks, who were ad∣opted slaves of Sultan Shab ul Dien Ghori.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">His charac∣ter.</NOTE>The disastrous,
interrupted, and inglorious reign of the weak Mahmood, lasted twenty years
and two months. He was just as un∣fit for the age in which he lived, as he
was unworthy of better times. God was angry with the people of Hindostan, and
he gave them Mahmood, whose only virtue was, that his folly made him
insensible, in a great measure, to those strokes of fortune, which
abilities much greater than his could not, perhaps, avert. The omrahs, soon
after his death, elected, in his stead, Dowlat Chan Lodi, a Patan by nation,
and originally a private secretary, whom Sultan Mah∣mood had raised to the
dignity of Aziz Mumalick<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">An officer something

received upon the throne, struck the currency in his own name, and began his

Malleck Ecteriz, and Mubariz Chan, who abandoned the interest of Chizer Chan.
He marched, in the first month of his reign, towards Kittar, and was met by
Rai Narsingh, and other zemindars of those districts, who acknowledged
his title. Arri∣ving at the town of Battiali, Mohabut Chan, of Budaoon, came to
meet him.</P>
<P>Advices, in the mean time, arrived, that Sultan Ibrahim Shirki was
besieging Kadir Chan, the son of Mahmood Chan, in Calpee, but as the
sultan had not forces enough to march to his relief, he returned to Delhi to
recruit his army. Chizer Chan, who had been preparing to invade the capital,
advanced, in the month of Zihidge, with sixty thousand horse, and a third
time laid siege to the citadel of Seri, whither Dowlat Chan had retired. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Is taken and deposed by Chizer

<NOTE PLACE="marg">His family.</NOTE>His father, Malleck Soli∣man,
being a person of some distinction, became the adopted son of Malleck
Murdan Dowlat, a great omrah, and Suba of Moultan, in the reign of Firose
Shaw. Malleck Murdan Dowlat was, upon his death, succeeded in his government
by his own son Malleck Shech; and he soon dying, Malleck Soliman was
appointed to that vice-royship, which descended to Chizer Chan from his
father. Chizer being defeated, as we have already observed, by Saring Chan,
and driven from his country, he waited upon Timur Shaw, after the conquest of
Delhi, and, having gained his favor, was by him re∣instated in his former
government, with the addition of Punjaab and Dibalpoor. This accession of
strength enabled him to pave afterwards his way to the empire.</P>
<P>Chizer Chan, upon his accession, conferred the title Tage ul
Malleck, upon Malleck Joppa, and made him Vizier; and that of Alla ul Malleck
upon Abdul Rahim, the adopted son of Mal∣leck Soliman, with the government of
Fattepoor and Moultan. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Does not as∣sume the name of

his other omrahs, but would not assume the imperial titles to himself,
hold∣ing forth, that he held the empire for Timur Shaw: and ordered the coin to
be struck in his name. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pretends to hold of Ti∣mur.</NOTE>The Chutba,
during the life of Timur, was read in that conqueror's name in the mosques;

Malleck, with an army, towards Kittar, which he subdued, and drove Rai
Narsingh to the mountains; but upon paying a tribute Rai Narsingh was again
put in possession of his country. Mohabut Chan, Suba of Badaoon, at the
same time came to meet Tage ul Malleck, and pro∣mised allegiance; and from
thence he marched towards Koes, Kumbul, and Chidewar, and levied the revenues
which were due for some years before. After recovering Jellasar out of the
hands of the Rajaputs of Chundwar, Malleck marched to Atava, which he brought
under subjection, by changing the administration; and after these
exploits returned to Delhi.</P>
<P>In the month Jemmad ul Awil of this year, a tribe of Turks, who
were of the adherents of Byram Chan, assassinating Malleck Siddic,
governor of Sirhind, took possession of his country.

Zirick Chan pursued them thither; but those mountains being a continuation
of those of Nagracot, which were then possessed by powerful
zemindars, who assisted the Turks, he could effect nothing material
against them; and, in the end, he was obliged to retreat.</P>

built by Sultan Alla ul Dien Chilligie, came out to meet him, and was honorably
received. The Sultan proceeded from thence to Gaulier, where he levied the
tribute upon the Raja, and then continued his march to Biana, taking tribute
from Kerim ul Mu∣luck. He after these transactions returned to Delhi.</P>

Chan, governor of Sammana, was immediately dispatched by Chizer, with a
strong force, against the Turk who besieged Sirhind, and he was once more
driven back to his hills; and a seasonable relief was accomplished for
the empire. Zirick Chan having, in pursuit of the enemy, reached the village
of Pael, Taan consented to pay tribute, and gave him his son as a
hostage, expelling the murderers of Malleck Siddic. Upon this pacification he
was left in possession of Jallender, and Zirick Chan returned to
Sammana, sending the hostage and contributions which he had raised, to
the royal presence.</P>

without ending the war, plundered and laid waste the province of Kittar, and
returned to Budaoon. Crossing then the river, he came to Atava, where he
raised contributions, and from thence returned to Delhi. Chizer went, in

the ban∣ditti of Schole. He crossed the Rahib, laid waste the country of
Simbol and Kittar, and, without coming to battle, returned to his capital.</P>
<P>He continued at Delhi a few days, and then moved towards Bu∣daoon,
crossing the Ganges at Pattali. Mahabut Chan being alarmed at his approach,
shut himself up in Budaoon, where the king be∣sieged him for six

vice∣roy of Lahore, and to recall Hassen. But, in the year eight hun∣dred
and twenty six, the Sultan deprived him of the vizarit, and conferred it upon
Surur ul Muluck, whom he dispatched against the Hindoos of Kittar. The
emperor himself followed that general with a greater army. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sultan Mu∣barick in∣vades Kittar.</NOTE>The
inhabitants of Kittar were sub∣dued, and a great tribute exacted from them.
The Sultan having settled affairs with Mahabut Chan, governor of Budaoon,
commanded him to march against the tribe of Toor, whom that general
plundered, and took prisoners to a man. The Raja of Attava hav∣ing, at this
time, withdrawn himself from the king's camp, Sultan Mubarick pursued him
to that place, and besieged him there. But terms of peace were settled
between them, and the Raja's son given as a hostage for his father's future
good behaviour. The king, after these transactions, returned to Delhi.</P>
<P>Malleck Hassen was, about this time, appointed Buxshi, or
pay∣master and commander in chief of the troops. Jisserit, unconquered by
his misfortunes, raised again his head, and, having defeated and slain Rai
Bimé, by a fresh acquisition of reputation and wealth, raised an
army of Gickers, with which he again attempted the conquest of Delhi. Having
ravaged the countries of Lahore and Debalpoor, he collected together very
considerable plunder, but when Malleck Se∣cunder Topha advanced against
him, he did not chuse to risque a battle, and therefore retired, with his
spoils, to the hills, where he busied himself in recruiting his army for
another attempt.</P>
<P>In the mean time, Jisserit made an alliance with Amir Ali, a
Mogul Omrah, a subject of Mirza Sharoch, who resided at Cabul. 
<PB N="26" REF="33"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A D. 1423. Hig. 827.</NOTE>He persuaded Amir
Ali to make an incursion into the territories of Seistan, Backer, and
Tatta, to draw off the king's attention from Delhi, and so to facilitate his
own schemes. Malleck Alla ul Dien, regent of Moultan, dying about this time,
and the news of Amir Ali's incursion being noised abroad, the sultan,
without delay, sent Malleck Mahummud Hassen, with the army, towards
Moultan. Sultan Hoshung, raja of Malava, had, in the same year, invested
Gualier, which obliged Sultan Mubarick Shaw to raise all the forces of
those provinces, and to march against him; levying, on his way,
contributions upon Amir Chan, of Biana.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Defeated by Mubarick.</NOTE>Sultan Hoshung,
upon the approach of Mubarick, crossed the Chumbul, and sat down on the
opposite bank. Mubarick Shaw having, in the mean time, found another ford,
crossed the river with great expedition, attacked Hoshung in his camp,
took many priso∣ners, and a part of the enemy's baggage. The prisoners
being found to be Mahommedans, were dismissed by the king. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sues for peace.</NOTE>Hoshung thought it then
adviseable to compound all differences, by paying down a sum of money to
the sultan; upon which he was permitted to withdraw towards Dhar. Mubarick
Shaw having tarried for some time in that place, to levy contributions upon
the neighbouring Ze∣mindars, returned, in the month of Rigib, eight hundred and
twenty seven, to Delhi.</P>
<P>The sultan, next year, made a motion towards Kittar, where Rai
Narsingh came to the banks of the Ganges, to pay his respects to him; but
as he did not pay the revenues of his territory, for three years back, he was
confined for a few days, till his accounts were settled, and then he was
released. The sultan crossed the river, chastised some riotous
Zemindars, and returned to Delhi. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mubarick re∣duces Mewat,</NOTE>He did not remain
there many days, before he drew his army towards Mewat, from whence he drove

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Disturbances in Mewat.</NOTE>But the
inhabitants of Mewat, rendered more desperate and distressed by the
king's bad policy, in ruining their country, were obliged to prey upon their
neighbours, and to infest all the adja∣cent countries. This circumstance
obliged the king, in the year eight hundred and twenty nine, to collect again
an army to subdue them. Upon his approach, Jillu and Kiddu, the grandsons
of Bad∣hader Nahir, retreated to the hills of Alwar, where they defended the
passes with great bravery. Being, at length, reduced to great distress,
they surrendered themselves, were imprisoned, their country was again
ravaged, and the sultan returned to Delhi.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mewat again reduced.</NOTE>But the
distresses of the people of Mewat did not render them peaceable
subjects. The sultan, after a recess of four months only, was again
obliged to turn his arms against them, and to carry fire and sword through
their whole country. He proceeded as far as Biana, where, after the death of
Amir Chan, his brother Ma∣hummud held the chief sway. Upon the approach of
the sultan, Mahummud shut himself up in the city, which he held out
against the king sixteen days; but, upon the desertion of the greatest
part of the garrison, he surrendered at discretion, and was, with a rope
about his neck, brought into the presence. The sultan de∣livered the city
to the care of Muckbul Chan, and sent Mahummud and his family to Delhi. To
Malleck Cheir ul Dien Topha he gave in charge the town of Sikri, known now by
the name of Fattipoor, marched to Gualier, raised contributions there, and
re∣turned to Delhi. He removed, at that time, Mahummud Hassen from the
government of Moultan to that of Firosa, bestowing the former upon Malleck
Rigib Nadir.</P>

to escape, with his family, to Mewat, and collecting a considerable force,
took the city of Biana, in the absence of Muckbul Chan, on an expedition to
Mahaban. The sultan dispatched Malleck Mu∣bariz, whom he appointed to that
government, to drive Mahum∣mud Chan from thence. Mahummud retired into the
fort, when Malleck Mubariz took possession of the country. After a few

<P>Kadir Shaw, governor of Calpee, upon this occasion sent

re∣lief, and having reached Aterawli, detached Malleck Mahummud Hassen,
with ten thousand horse, against Muchtiss Chan, the brother of Sultan
Shirki, who was in motion with a considerable force to reduce Attava. This
detachment, however, encountering Muchtiss, drove him back to his brother,
and Mahummud Hassen returned to the army.</P>
<P>Sultan Shirki advanced along the banks of the Black River to
Burhanabad, from thence to the village of Raberi, and so on to the banks of
Kinhire, where he encamped. Mubarick Shaw, in the mean time, crossing the
Jumna, near Chundwar, encamped within five crores of the enemy. Both armies
remained in their trenches for the space of twenty-two days, during which
time, slight skirmishes daily happened between them. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sultan Shirki advances against

the advantage he had gained, returned towards Gualier, crossing the river
at Hitgaut. Having received there the usual presents, he turned off towards
Biana, into which Mahummud Chan had again thrown himself, after the battle.
He made a gallant defence, but was again obliged to capitulate, and had leave

sent him governor to Moultan. The sultan, in the fol∣lowing year, proceeded
to Gualier, which country he ravaged, and carried off some thousands of the

hopes, it is said, that they might be sent with a force to sup∣press
the rebellion, and so have an opportunity to join the rebels. But the plot
was discovered, and both imprisoned; while, in the mean time, Malleck

a negotiation, lulled into a negligent secu∣rity the imperial generals, and
sallying one night from his fort, sur∣prized their camp. He was, however,
so warmly received by the king's troops, that he was soon driven back. This
did not deter him from making another effort next night, at the same time
making a great discharge of artillery from the works, which struck a panic
into the imperial troops, who took immediately to their heels, leav∣ing their

<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mubarick marches against him.</NOTE>Sultan
Mubarick, upon receiving advice of that disaster, was constrained to
march to∣wards Tibberhind in person. The rebel daily gathered strength, and
the king was obliged to call Ameid ul Muluck from Moultan, and several other
governors, to join him. Every thing for the expedi∣tion being prepared, the
sultan stopped at Sursutti, and dispatched the greatest part of his
army to invest the fort of Tibberhind. Fow∣lad sent a message to the
imperial camp, importing, that he had <PB N="31" REF="38"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1429. Hig. 833.</NOTE>great confidence in
Ameid ul Muluck, and said, that if he should be sent with promise of
pardon, he himself would deliver up the place. The sultan accordingly
sent Ameid ul Muluck to Tibberhind, where Fowlad met him a little without the
gate. Having accordingly re∣ceived assurances of pardon, he promised to
give up the place the next day. But one of Ameid ul Muluck's attendants, who
was of Fowlad's acquaintance, told him privately, that though Ameid ul Muluck
was a man of strict honour, and would certainly adhere to his promise, yet
the king might not be so tender of preserving his, and that it was very
probable he might bring Fowlad to punishment. Fowlad, after the conference
was over, revolved this intimation in his own mind, and repented seriously
of his promise; and, therefore, as he had both money and provisions, he
determined to hold out to the last.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Besieges him.</NOTE>The sultan seeing
that the taking of the place would be a work of time, and that there would be
no occasion for so great an army to besiege it, he permitted Ameid ul
Muluck to return with the forces of Moultan, and leaving Islam Chan Lodi,
Cummal Chan, and Rai Firose, to carry on the siege, he himself retired to
Delhi. Fowlad having held out six months, he was greatly distressed,
and saw no means of extricating himself, but by an alliance with Amir Shech

sent, for this purpose, messengers to him, with large pro∣mises for

Lahore, he raised the usual tribute from Se∣cunder Topha, then returned
towards Dibalpoor, desolating the country wherever he went; insomuch that
forty thousand Hindoos were computed to have been massacred, besides a
greater number carried away prisoners. Ameid ul Muluck posted himself to
oppose Ali, at the town of Tilbanna, but he gave him the slip, and went to
Chitpoor, when Ameid ul Muluck received the sultan's orders to retreat to
save Moultan. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">March to Moultan.</NOTE>The flight of the

Islam Chan Lodi, who had been left to stop his progress.</P>
<P>From thence the Moguls advanced to Cheirabad, within three crores

Afghan, of the tribe of Lodi, which people, forming themselves into a
commercial society, carried on a trade between Persia and Hindostan. In
the time of Sultan Firose Shaw, Malleck Ibrahim, the grandfather of Beloli,
being possessed of wealth, made his way at the court of Delhi, and
raised himself to the government of Moultan. Malleck Ibrahim had five
sons, Malleck Sultan Shech, Malleck Culla, Malleck Firose, Mal∣leck
Mahummud, and Malleck Chaja, who, on the death of their father remained in
Moultan.</P>
<P>When Chizer Chan was appointed to that government, Sultan Shech
received the command of all his Afghan troops. In the action which Chizer Chan
had with Eckbal Chan, Sultan Shech had the good fortune to kill Eckbal, by
which means he became a great favorite with Chizer Chan. He was accordingly
appointed by that prince governor of Sirhind, with the title of Islam Chan,
while his brothers partook of his fortune. One of whom, Malleck Calla, the
father of Sultan Beloli, had a district bestowed upon him by his

Beloli.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Distinguishes himself in an

went to his uncle, Islam Chan, at Sirhind, and upon his distinguishing
himself in a battle, his uncle gave him his own daughter in marriage. Islam
Chan was, at this time, so powerful, that he retained twelve thousand
Afghans, mostly of his own tribe, in his service.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Islam Chan recommends B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>loli to the government of Sirhind.</NOTE>Islam Chan, at

of which adhered to Beloli, one to Malleck Firose, brother to Islam Chan,
who had been made an omrah by the king of Delhi, and the other to Cuttub Chan,
the son of Islam Chan. But Malleck Beloli, who was the most artful of the
three, found means to weaken his rivals, and en∣crease his own power.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cuttub Chan complains at the court of

Shaw, that the Afghans of Sirhind were establishing a power, which,
unless it was soon prevented, would shake the empire. The sultan

great part of his army slain.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Beloli be∣comes pow∣erful.</NOTE>When
Jisserit had retired to Punjaab, Beloli collected the re∣mains of his
tribe, and began to raise contributions, or plunder wherever he could, and as
he was extremely generous in dividing the spoil among his followers, he
soon became very powerful. Some time after Malleck Firose fled from Delhi,
and joined him; and Cuttub Chan, repenting of his former behaviour, found means
to be reconciled to Beloli. Beloli soon after invaded Sirhind, and
possessed himself of that province. Upon receiving intelligence of
these transactions, Sultan Mahummud Shaw sent Hissam Chan, his
vizier, with a great army against him. Malleck Beloli took the field, and
giving the vizier battle, defeated him, by which his power and reputation
greatly encreased.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Is promised
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> by a Dirvesh.</NOTE>We are
told, that when Beloli was yet a youth in his uncle's service, one day he was
permitted to pay his respects to a fa∣mous Dirvesh of Sammana, whose name
was Sheidai. When he sat in a respectful posture before him, the
Dirvesh cried out, in an enthusiastick manner, 
<Q REND="inline">"Who will give two thousand rupees for the
empire of Delhi?"</Q> Upon which Malleck Beloli told him, he had only one
thousand six hundred rupees in the world, which he ordered his servant to
bring immediately and present to the Dirvesh. The Dirvesh accepted the
money, and, laying his hand upon the head of Beloli, saluted him king.</P>
<P>The companions of Beloli ridiculed him very much for this ac∣tion;
but he replied,

<P>Upon a mind naturally ambitious, and in an age of
superstition, this prediction of the Dirvesh might have great effect, in
promoting its own end; for when a man's mind is once bent upon the at∣tainment
of one object, the greatest difficulties will be often sur∣mounted, by a
steady perseverance. But to return from this di∣gression.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1450. Hig. 854.</NOTE>After Beloli had
defeated the vizier, he wrote to the sultan, as before related, laying the
whole blame of his rebellion upon the vizier's conduct towards him. When the
sultan basely complied with his desire of cutting off the vizier, Beloli,
according to his promise, waited upon the king, that he might be better able
to carry on his intrigues at court. He managed his affairs at Delhi so well,
that he got the government of Sirhind, and other districts near it, confirmed
to him in jagier; which were the means that enabled him to mount the musnud,
as we have already seen, in the former reign.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">His sons and relations.</NOTE>He had, at the

omrahs of renown, who were related to him, there were thirty six in the
empire.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">His strata∣gem against Hamid Chan.</NOTE>As
Hamid Chan, the vizier, who conferred the empire upon him, had great influence
still in the state, he treated him for some time with honor and
respect. Being one day in Hamid Chan's house, at an entertainment, he
ordered the companions whom he carried with him, to make themselves appear as
foolish and ridiculous as possible, that the vizier might consider them
as <PB N="49" REF="56"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1450. Hig. 854.</NOTE>silly fellows;
that so he might be less upon his guard against them. When they
accordingly came into company, some tied their shoes to their girdles, and
others put them up in the niches of the apartment.</P>
<P>Hamid Chan asked them the reason of that extraordinary
custom. They replied, that they were afraid of thieves. When they had taken
their seats upon the carpet, one of them began to praise the flowers, and
brightness of the colours, saying, He would be extremely glad to have
such a carpet, to send home to his own country, to make caps for his boys.
Hamid Chan laughed, and told him, he would give him velvet or brocade for that
purpose. When the plates and boxes of perfumes were laid before them, some
began to rub the finest otter of roses all over them, others to drink it,
and others to devour whole festoons of flowers, while the beetle stood no
chance, but was eat up, cover and all; some, who had eat large pieces of
chunam, by having their mouths burnt, made a terrible outcry; and, in this kind
of foolery every one was endeavouring to outdo another, while the king and the
vizier were almost bursting with laughter.</P>
<P>The vizier, imagining that this behaviour proceeded from the
king's humour, who had a mind to make merry in his house, was extremely
pleased, and had no suspicion of men given to so much mirth. The next
visit the king paid to Hamid Chan, a greater number of his attendants were
admitted; but as Hamid Chan had still a greater number of his own friends
within the court, it was necessary to gain admission for some more of
the king's people, who were stopped without by the guards. The king having
before in∣structed them how to proceed in this case, they began loudly to
wrangle with the guard, and threw out bitter invectives against the king, for
permitting them to be so unworthily treated. They even swore that they
respected the vizier, and would see him.</P>
<P> <PB N="50" REF="57"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A D. 1451. Hig. 855.</NOTE>The vizier hearing
this, ordered the doors to be thrown open, and as many to be admitted as the

all his people drawing at once, told Hamid Chan's servants to remain quiet,
and they should come to no harm.

government. Beloli marching from thence to Attava, he regulated that
government, and confirmed the former Suba.</P>
<P>Jonah Chan quitted, about this time, the court in disgust, and
joined Sultan Mahmood Shirki, from whom he received the go∣vernment of
Shumseabad.

Beloli should keep possession of all the countries possessed
by Mubarick Shaw, and that Sultan Mahmood should hold all that was in the
possession <PB N="52" REF="59"/> of Sultan Ibrahim, of Jionpoor; that
the former should give up all the elephants taken in the engagement with
Fatti Chan, and the latter turn Jonah Chan out of his government.</P>
<P>Sultan Mahmood, immediately after this pacification, returned to
Jionpoor, and Sultan Beloli went to Shumseabad to take possession of
it. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Shirki, of∣fended at Beloli, marches against

Lodi surprized his camp in the night. But during the attack, the horse of
Cuttub Chan having trod upon a tent-pin, threw him, and he was taken by the
enemy, and his party re∣treated to their own camp. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dies.</NOTE>Sultan Beloli drew out his army in
the morning, but received advice that Sultan Mahmood had just ex∣pired, and
that the omrahs had set up his son Mahummud Shaw; and, by the mediation of
Bibi Raja, the young king's mother, who probably had received previous
assurances, a peace was immediately concluded. Mahummud Shaw returned to
Jionpoor, and Sultan Beloli took the rout of Delhi.</P>
<P>Before the sultan arrived at the capital, he received a letter
from Shumsh Chatoon, the sister of Cuttub Chan, conjuring him, in the
most tender manner, not to suffer her brother to remain in captivity. This
prevailed upon Beloli to break up the peace he had just con∣cluded, and to
march towards Jionpoor. Mahummud Shaw met him near Sirsutti. The younger
brother of Mahummud Shaw, Has∣sen Chan, fearing his brother's resentment
for some trespass, took this opportunity of marching off, with all his
adherents, to Kinnoge. Sittal Chan, his other brother, soon followed him, but
the detach∣ment which Sultan Beloli had sent after Hassen Chan, met
Sittal Chan on the way, and took him prisoner. The sultan determined to
keep him as a ransom for Cuttub Chan.</P>
<P> <PB N="53" REF="60"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Beloli marches against Mahummud, who is

Mahummud Shaw, and having assassinated him, advanced Hassen Chan,
who had fled to Kinnoge, to the throne. Sultan Beloli, for what reason we
know not, took no advantages of these disorders, but now en∣tered into a
truce with Sultan Hassen Chan for the space of four years; Cuttub Chan
and Sittab Chan being interchangeably re∣leased.</P>
<P>Beloli returned towards Shumseabab, whither Bir-Singh, the son
of Rai Partab, came to pay his compliments. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Treachery of Diria Chan.</NOTE>But as his father
had taken a standard and a pair of drums formerly from Deria Chan in an

assassi∣nating Bir-Singhi. Cuttub Chan, the son of Hassen Chan,
Muba∣riz Chan, and Rai Partab, differing with the cruel traitor about this
murder, were obliged to fly to Sultan Hassein. Beloli, after these
transactions, returned to Delhi.</P>
<P>But, upon account of the rebellion of the viceroy of Moultan, and
the disorders in Punjaab, he marched towards that quarter. Upon his way, he
heard that Sultan Hassein Shirki was advancing, in his absence, with a
great army, to take Delhi. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Beloli marchers against Sultan

peaceable terms.</P>
<P>Much about this time, the mother of Sultan Hassein, Bibi Raja,
died at Attava, and the Raja of Gualier and Cuttub Chan Lodi, went to console
him upon that occasion. When in discourse, Cut∣tub Chan perceived that
Hassein Chan was a bitter enemy of Beloli, he began to flatter him after
this manner:—Beloli is one of your dependants, and cannot think of
contending long with you. If I do not put you in possession of Delhi,
look on my word as nothing. He then, with much art, got leave to depart from
Hassein's court, and returned to Delhi, and there he told to Sultan Beloli
that he had escaped with a great deal of difficulty from the hands of Sultan
Has∣sein, who was meditating a fresh war against him.</P>

<P> <PB N="55" REF="62"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1478. Hig. 883.</NOTE>Cuttub Chan
dispatched a person to Hassein, informing him, that Sultan Beloli was
ready to relinquish all the countries beyond the Ganges, upon condition he
should leave him in possession of all the provinces on this side of
that river. These terms being accepted, they reversed their hostile
spears, and Sultan Hassein marched homeward. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Beloli's per∣fidy.</NOTE>But Sultan Beloli, in a
perfidious manner, broke the peace, and pursuing Hassein, attacked him
upon his march, killing a great number, and taking forty omrahs prisoners,
besides part of his treasure and equipage. Beloli pursued his victory,
and took several districts belonging to Sultan Hassein, such as
Campul, Pattiali, Shumseabad, Sickite, Marhera, Sittali, and Koli, appointing
agents to manage them under him. But when he had pursued Hassein as far
as Arumbidger, the latter stood his ground, and engaged Beloli. The victory
being dubious, a peace was patched up between them, the village of Doupamou
being settled as the boundary between the empires. After this pacification,
Sultan Hassein proceeded to Ra∣beri, and Sultan Beloli returned to
Delhi.</P>
<P>Sultan Hassein could not, however, forget the perfidy of
Beloli. He recruited his army, and some time after marched against him, and
met him at the village of Sinhar, when an obstinate battle en∣sued, in
which Sultan Hassein was defeated, and lost all his treasure and
baggage; which, together with an addition of reputation, greatly promoted the
affairs of Beloli. Sultan Hassein having re∣treated to Raberi, he was
followed thither by Beloli, and upon standing a second engagement, he was
again totally defeated. After the battle, he retreated towards Gualier; the
raja of Gualier brought him some lacks of rupees, elephants, horses,
camels, and a fine set of camp equipage, and accompanied him to Calpie.</P>
<P>Sultan Beloli went, in the mean time, to Attava, where he
be∣sieged Ibrahim Chan, the brother of Sultan Hassein, and took the place
by capitulation. He, however, generously made him a present 
<PB N="56" REF="63"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1478. Hig. 883.</NOTE>of the fort, and
proceeded to Calpie; Sultan Hassein met him upon the banks of the river,
where they remained for some months. But Rai Muluck Chand of Buxar, coming
over to Sultan Beloli, shewed him a passable ford in the river, by which
he crossed, and attacking Sultan Hassein, defeated him, and drove him
to Jionpoor, upon which Sultan Beloli turned off to the left towards Kinnoge.
Sultan Hassein again met him near that city, but he was once more defeat∣ed
with great slaughter. His regalia and equipage were taken, and also the
chief lady of his seraglio, Bibi Conzah, the daughter of Sultan Alla ul Dien,
who was treated with great respect. Sultan Beloli returned, after this
victory, to Delhi.</P>
<P>Having recruited and regulated his army, he advanced the spear
of hostility again towards Jionpoor. He conquered that country, and gave it
to Mubarick Chan Lohani, leaving Cuttub Chan Lodi, Chan Jehan, and other
omrahs, at Migouli, to secure his conquests. He himself went to Budaoon,
where he soon after heard of Cuttub Chan's death. Chan Jehan, Mubarick Chan,
and other omrahs, though they kept up the appearance of fidelity, were, after
the death of Cuttub, concerning measures to throw off the sultan's
yoke.</P>
<P>Beloli being apprized of their intentions, marched towards
Jion∣poor, and drove away Hassein, who had made an attempt to recover it,
and placed Barbee Shaw, one of his own sons, upon the throne of Jionpoor. He
himself returned to Calpie, which he took, and gave to his grandson, Azim
Hamaioon Ben Baizied. He directed then his march to Dolepore, raising a
tribute upon the raja of that place, who began to rank himself among Beloli's
subjects. The sultan went from thence to a place in the districts of
Rintimpore, which he plundered, and soon after returned to Delhi.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Beloli, being old and infirm, divides his

little before by his own servant; Budaoon to Chan Jehan, one of his old
omrahs, and a relation; and Delhi, with several countries be∣tween the two
rivers, to his son Nizam Chan, known afterwards by the name of Sultan
Secunder, whom he appointed his successor in the imperial dignity.</P>
<P>Some time after this division the sultan proceeded to Gualier,
and raising a tribute of eighty lacks of rupees from the raja of that place,
came to Attava, from whence he expelled Sickit Sing, and then turned his face
towards Delhi. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">He falls sick.</NOTE>Falling sick upon his
march, many of the omrahs were desirous that he should alter his former
will, with re∣spect to the succession, which, they said, was the
undoubted right of Azim Humaioon, his grandson. The sultana, upon this,
wrote to her son, Nizam Chan, who, having heard of his father's illness,
was setting out from Delhi, by no means to come, otherwise he might be
impri∣soned by the omrahs: At the same time the sultan, by the advice of
some omrahs, ordered public letters to be sent him, to hasten him to
camp, that he might see him before his death. Nizam Chan was greatly
perplexed how to act upon this nice occasion. He, at length, was advised by
Cuttuluk Chan, the vizier of Sultan Hassein Shirki, who was then prisoner
at Delhi, to pitch his tents without the city, and to advance by very slow
marches.

rewarded according to their merit. He had given so many proofs of personal

excess, never chusing to trust much to chance, and delighting greatly in

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1488. Hig. 894.</NOTE><NOTE PLACE="marg">The omrahs variously inclined.</NOTE>THE omrahs, immediately
upon the death of Beloli, formed themselves into a council, in which some
appeared to be attached to the interest of Azim Humaioon, some to Barbeck,
the eldest son of the sultan then living, and some to Secunder, in
con∣sequence of his father's will. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Debate about a successor to
Beloli.</NOTE>When they were debating, the mo∣ther of Secunder, whose name
was Rana, originally a goldsmith's daughter, but raised to the sultan's
bed, by the same of her beauty, came behind the curtain, in the great tent,
and made a speech to the omrahs, in favor of her son. Upon which Isah
Chan, the nephew of Beloli, answered her, in a disrespectful manner, and
con∣cluded with saying, that a goldsmith's offspring was not qualified to
hold the empire.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Firmilli's boldness.</NOTE>Chan Chanan
Firmilli, a stout daring man, took him up, and told him, That the sultan

<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1488. Hig. 894.</NOTE>to be despised.
Isah Chan replied, That silence would better become him, who was only a
servant of the state. Upon which the other rose up, in a rage, and told
him, he was, indeed, a servant of Sultan Secunder, and would maintain his
right against all who durst oppose it. He rushed out of the council,
followed by all his party, and carried off the body of the deceased king to
Jellali, 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Secunder mounts the throne.</NOTE>where he was
met by Sultan Secunder, who there ascended his father's throne.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Defeats and pardons Isah Chan.</NOTE>Secunder
sending the corpse of his father to Delhi, marched against Isah Chan,
and having defeated him, afterwards forgave his offence. Returning then to
Delhi, he, in the manner of his father, con∣ferred favors upon all his
kindred.</P>
<P>Secunder had, at this time, six sons, Ibrahim Chan,
Jellâl Chan, Ishmaiel Chan, Hassein Chan, Mahmood Chan, and Shech
Azim Humaioon; and likewise fifty three omrahs of distinction in his
service.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Marches against his brother Allum.</NOTE>Some
time after his accession, Secunder marched towards Ra∣beri, and besieged
his own brother, Allum Chan, in the fort of Chundwar, for some days. Allum
evacuated the place, and fled to Isah Chan Lodi, at Pattiali. Sultan Secunder
gave Raberi to Chan Chanan, went, in person, to Attava, and calling Allum
Chan, his brother, to court, gave him possession of that country. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Again defeats Isah Chan.</NOTE>He then
advanced to Pattiali, engaged Isah Chan, wounded, and defeated him; after
which Isah Chan threw himself upon Secunder's mercy, was pardoned, and
soon after died of his wound.</P>
<P>Sultan Secunder, about that time, sent a trusty person to
Barbeck Shaw, his brother, king of Jionpoor, desiring he would do him homage,
and order his name to be read first in the chutba all over his do∣minions.

him, alighted from his horse, and embraced him, saying, that he esteemed

<P>Calla Par, confounded at this honor done him, replied, that,
except his life, he had nothing to make a recompence for such kindness,
desiring to get a horse, that he might show himself not wholly unworthy
of his favor. He was accordingly mounted, and he perfidiously sold his
honor for a compliment, turning his sword against Barbeck Shaw; which
circumstance, in some measure, con∣tributed to the success of
Secunder.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">and taken; used with kindness and

Shaw in Budaoon, who, soon driven to distress, capitulated, and was
receiv∣ed with great kindness and respect. The sultan carried Barbeck
with him to Jionpoor; but as Sultan Hassein Shirki was still a powerful
prince in Behar, he thought Barbeck would be the pro∣perest person to check
him, and accordingly confirmed him as before in the government of Jionpoor;
leaving, however, some trusty friends at his court, upon whom he bestowed
jagiers and pergunnahs, to keep them firm in his own interest.</P>

<P>The sultan, after these transactions, marched towards
Chinar, which was held for Sultan Hassein Shirki; upon his approach, the

<NOTE PLACE="marg">Battea taken and destroy∣ed.</NOTE>Secunder,
to revenge this affront, put his army in motion against the Raja, in the year

ravaged the country round Bandugur, he returned to Jionpoor, where he spent
some time, in the civil regulations of the empire.</P>

inspected for the time of his administration in Jionpoor, and a great
ballance being found due to the royal revenue, the king ordered it to be levied
upon him. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The omrahs dissatisfied.</NOTE>This
severity greatly disgusted the omrahs, among whom Mubarick Chan was very
much esteemed. A faction accordingly arose in the army, which first
discovered itself by private quarrels. For, one day, as the sultan and
his court were playing a party at club and ball, on horseback, the club of
Hybut Chan, by accident, or design, fractured the scull of one Soliman.
Chizer, the brother of Soliman, came up, and returned the compliment to Hybut
Chan; 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Quarrels in the camp.</NOTE>so that, in a few

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The sultan suspects a

but nothing of that kind transpiring, he made another party at the same
game, some days thereafter, and a quarrel of the same nature ensued, for
which Shumse Chan, who begun it, was disgraced, and bastinadoed. But the
sultan would not be satisfied but that there was some plot in agitation,
and therefore ordered his guards to be selected, and to keep upon the
watch.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A plot dis∣covered.</NOTE>The king's
jealousies were not groundless; for at that time, Hybut Chan, and two other
chiefs, had proposed to Fatti Chan, the king's brother, to cut off the
sultan, who, they said, was now disliked by <PB N="66" REF="73"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1499. Hig. 905.</NOTE>the generality of
the omrahs, and to place Fatti upon the throne. Fatti Chan desiring some
time to consider of it, disclosed the secret to Shech Cabuli, and to
his own mother, who advised him against so horrid an action; and, lest
the affair should, by any other means, transpire, she desired him to
acquaint the sultan of their proposal. This he did accordingly, and the
conspirators were detached upon different services, where they were put to
death by the sultan's orders.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The sultan retires for four years to
Simbol.</NOTE>Secunder, in the year nine hundred and five, marched to Simbol,
where he spent four years in pleasure, and in transacting civil affairs.
But hearing of some bad administration of Asghir, the governor of Delhi,
he sent an order to Chawass Chan, governor of Matchiwarri, to march to
Delhi, and send Asghir prisoner to court. The go∣vernor receiving advice
of this order, left Delhi, and threw himself at the sultan's feet, but not
being able to form any excuse for his bad practices, he was ordered into
confinement.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A remarka∣ble instance of religious
persecution.</NOTE>At this time there happened a remarkable instance of
reli∣gious zeal and persecution. A Brahmin, whose name was Bhodin, upon
being abused by a Mahommedan, for his idolatry, happened to make a very
moderate, but what proved to him a fatal reply. The reply was this: 
<Q REND="inline">"That he esteemed the same God to be the
object of all worship, and, therefore, believed the Mahomedan and Hindoo
religions to be equally good."</Q> The bigotted Ma∣hommedan, for what he
thought the impiety of this answer, sum∣moned the Brahmin immediately
before the easy. The affair making some noise, by the various opinions of
the public, the king called together all the Mahommedan doctors of fame in the
empire, to decide the cause. After many long disputes, the doctors brought
in their verdict, that the Brahmin should be forced to turn Mahom∣medan, or
be put to death. The Brahmin, however charitable he might have been to all
opinions upon religion, refused to apostatize, <PB N="67" REF="74"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1501. Hig. 907.</NOTE>and accordingly died
a martyr to his faith, which reflects no small dishonor upon the sultan
and his inquisitors.</P>
<P>When Chawass Chan entered Delhi, he found an order from the
emperor to proceed immediately to court, with which he instantly complied. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Some fac∣tious omrahs banished.</NOTE>At the

factious disposition, and com∣menced some treasonable projects, for
which he, Tattar Chan, and Mahummud Shaw, were banished to Guzerat.</P>
<P>In the nine hundred and seventh of the Higera, Rai Man Sing, of

<NOTE PLACE="marg">Disturbances in Biana.</NOTE>But he was
prevented from the execution of his purpose, for some time, by the death of
Chan Chanan Firmilli, governor of Biana, and by those disturbances in that
province, which succeeded his death. The government of Biana having devolved
upon Ameid Soliman, the son of Chan Chanan, who was yet too young and
unexperienced for such a charge, the king gave that appointment to Chawass
Chan. Sifdir Chan was sent with a force to reduce Agra, which belonged to the
province of Biana, and had then revolted; another detachment being sent, at
the same time, to reduce the fort of Dolipoor, which was in the
possession of Raja Benaecdeo, who had begun to make warlike
preparations. Here Chaja Bein, a warrior of great fame, fell by the sword,
which so irritated the sultan, who had a great esteem for him, that he
marched himself against that place. Upon his approach Rai Be∣naecdeo left
some friends in the fort, and fled towards Gualier, but the garrison, the
next night, evacuated the place, and left the sultan to take
possession of it.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Secunder marches to Gualier.</NOTE>He tarried

sending him Seid Chan, Baboo Chan, Rai Ginish, and others, who had, at
different times, fled from the sultan, and taken protection under him. At the
same time, he sent his own son, Bickermagit, with presents, who had the
address to procure peace.</P>
<P>The sultan returned to Dolipoor, which he again bestowed upon
Rai Benaecdeo; 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Makes Agra the royal re∣sidence.</NOTE>then
marching to Agra, he, for the first time, made that city imperial, by fixing
his residence there, and aban∣doning the city of Delhi. Here he remained
during the rains, and, in the year nine hundred and ten, marched towards
Munderael, which he took, and destroyed the Hindoo temples, ordering
mosques to be built in their stead. Secunder returning to Dolipoor, removed
the raja from his office, and gave it to Shech Kimir ul Dien. He passed
from thence to Agra, giving his omrahs leave to return to their respective
estates.</P>

the third of Siffer, there was a violent earthquake in Agra, so that the
mountains shook on their broad bases, and every lofty building was levelled
with the ground, some thousands being buried in the ruins. The sultan, in
the same year, moved towards Gualier, and stopped by the way some time at
Dolipoor, where he left his family, and, with an unincumbered army of horse,
proceeded to the hills, to plunder some Hindoo rajas, from whom he took great
spoils, and ravaged their peaceful habitations. Just as the sultan was
passing by the town of Javer, in the dominions of the raja of Gualier, he
was attacked by a resolute body of men, who had laid in ambush for him;
but, by the bravery of Awid Chan and Ahmed Chan, the sons of Chan Jehan, the
Hindoos were defeated, and a great number of rajaputs put to the sword.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1506. Hig. 912.</NOTE><NOTE PLACE="marg">Secunder be∣sieges Awint∣gur, which is taken.</NOTE>The sultan
returned to Agra; and, in the year nine hundred and twelve, he went towards the
fort of Awintgur; and, as he had des∣paired of reducing Gualier, he bent his
whole strength to the re∣duction of this place. It was accordingly, in a
short time, taken, and all the rajaput garrison put to the sword, the
temples destroyed, and mosques ordered to be built in their places. This
government was conferred upon Bickin, the son of Mujahid Chan, when some
envious persons gave the king information that Mujahid Chan had taken a bribe
from the raja of Awintgur, when they were marching against him, in order to
divert the king from that resolution. This being proved, Mujahid Chan was
imprisoned at Dolipoor; after which the king, returning towards Agra, on the
way lost eight hundred men, in one day, for want of water.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Secunder marches against Nar∣var,</NOTE>The
sultan, eyeing from his march the ruins of Agra, moved towards Narvar, a
strong fort, in the district of Malava, then in the possession of
the Hindoos. He ordered Jellal Chan, governor of Calpie, to advance before him,
and invest the place, which was ac∣cordingly done. When the sultan arrived
before Narvar, Jellal Chan drew up his army, out of respect, that the king
might review them as he passed. This circumstance proved very hurtful to
Jellal, for, from that time, the king became jealous of his power, and
determined to ruin him.</P>
<P>The sultan surrounded the place, which was eight crores in
cir∣cumference, and began to carry on the siege. The siege was now
protracted eight months, when the sultan received intelligence, that a
treasonable correspondence was carried on between some of his omrahs and
the garrison, for which Jellal Chan and Sheri Chan were imprisoned in the
fort of Awintgur. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">which he takes.</NOTE>The garrison, soon
after, was obliged to capitulate, for want of provisions, and the king
re∣mained, for the space of six months, at Narvar, breaking down

<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1509. Hig. 915.</NOTE>temples, and
building mosques. He there also established a kind of monastery,
which he filled with divines and learned men.</P>
<P>Shab ul Dien, the son of Nasir ul Dien, king of Malava, being
at this time discontented with his father, proposed to meet Secun∣der. The
sultan immediately sent him a dress, and promised to sup∣port him in
the government of Chinderi, against the power of his father. But
circumstances so fell out, that it became unnecessary to take that
unnatural step.</P>
<P>The sultan, in the month of Shuban, nine hundred and fourteen,
marched from Narvar; but after he had advanced to the river, he began to
consider that it would be proper to surround that fortress with another
wall. He therefore ordered that work to be immediately begun, and then he
himself took the rout of Lohar. At that place he bestowed Calpie, in
jagier, upon Niamut Chatoon, the wife of Cuttub Chan Lodi, and daughter of the
prince Jellâl Chan. He then directed his march towards the capital, and
arriving at Hitgat, sent a detachment against some rebels in that
country, and destroyed all their habitations, placing small garrisons at
proper distances to overawe them. About this time he received advices, that
Ahmed Chan, the son of Mubarick Chan Lodi, governor of Lucknore, had turned
idolater; upon which orders were dispatched to send him pri∣soner to
court, and that his second brother, Sud Chan, should take the
administration of affairs in his stead.</P>
<P>In the year nine hundred and fifteen, the king marched to
Doli∣poor, and ordered caravanseras to be built at every stage. Mahum∣mud
Chan Nagori having defeated Ali Chan and Abu Bicker, who had conspired
against him, they fled to the sultan for protection. Mahummud Chan, fearing
they would bring the sultan against him, sent presents by way of
prevention, and ordered the chutba to be <PB N="71" REF="78"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1509. Hig. 915.</NOTE>read in Secunder's
name. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The sultan returns to∣wards Agra.</NOTE>The
sultan, pleased with his submission, sent him a dress of
confirmation, and returned to Agra.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Secunder's transactions at Delipoor.</NOTE>He
spent some months there in building, making spacious gardens, and in
hunting, then returned to Dolipoor, ordering Miah Soliman, the son of Chan
Chanan, to succour Hussen Chan. Soliman very imprudently told the king,
that he could not prevail upon himself to leave the presence. This
expression threw the sultan into a violent rage, and he forthwith ordered
him from his service and camp by next morning at day-light, or that
otherwise all his effects should be given to the soldiers as public
plunder.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Reduces Chinderi.</NOTE>Much about this time,
Bogit Chan, governor of Chinderi, who held that place of the king of Malava,
seeing the weakness of his own prince, turned his face to Sultan Secunder.
That monarch sent Amad ul Muluck to support Bogit in his rebellion. He
soon after returned to Agra, and issued a proclamation bearing the
sub∣mission of Bogit Chan, and his own consequent right to that
coun∣try. He sent more troops and omrahs to Chinderi, who entirely settled
it as an appendage of the empire. Bogit Chan found matters carried on in his
government in such a manner, that he was con∣strained to resign his
office, and come to court.</P>
<P>After this, we find no transactions worthy of memory in the
em∣pire, till the year nine hundred and twenty two. Ali Chan Nagori,
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uba of Suisuper, in that year
prevailed upon Dowlat Chan, gover∣nor of Rintimpore, which he then held of
Malava, to deliver the fort to Sultan Secunder, if that monarch should come
in person to take possession of it. The sultan, with great joy,
closed with the proposal, and set out towards Biana, to which place the
governor of Rintimpore came to meet him, and was graciously received. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Disappointed in his designs upon
Rin∣timpore.</NOTE>But Ali Chan, who had been disappointed in some favors

prevent the <PB N="72" REF="79"/>

found out the cause of this change, disgraced Ali Chan, and deprived him of

insupportable pride and arrogance to his friends and family. One foolish
expression of his was, that king's had no relations, but that every body
should be the slaves of royalty. The omrahs, who were always before honored
with a seat in the presence, were now constrained to stand by the
throne, with their hands crossed before them. They were so much
disgusted with this insolence, that they privately became his
enemies.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A conspi∣racy.</NOTE>A conspiracy therefore

<P>Chan Jehan Lohani came at that time from Beri, to congratulate
Sultan Ibrahim upon his accession, and, in a very high strain, be∣gan to
blame the omrahs for dividing the empire, which, he said, would be attended
with many evil consequences. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Designs to reunite it.</NOTE>The omrahs,
sensible of the impropriety of their conduct, determined, as Jellal Chan
could not yet be well established, to call him back, and so divest him
of his new-assumed royalty. They accordingly sent Hybut Chan, with
deceptious letters, to recal him, saying, that there was a scheme for him
in agitation, and that it was necessary he should speedily come to
support it.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The omrahs endeavour in vain to inveigle

<P>Sultan Ibrahim, and his omrahs, finding that these baits would
not take with Jellal, issued a proclamation, declaring all the om∣rahs, who
should join him, traitors to the state; at the same time sending
presents and envoys to all the principal officers in those parts. These

<P>Diria Chan, suba of Beria, died about this time, and his son
of the same name, assumed the title of Sultan Mahummud, with all the
ensigns of royalty. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Another re∣bellion.</NOTE>He was joined by all

<P>Ghazi Chan Lodi came about this time with the army from Lahore, by
the sultan's orders. But having heard of his tyrannies, by the way, he was
apprehensive of danger to himself, and returned to his father, Dowlat Chan,
at Lahore. Dowlat, seeing no safety but in extremes, revolted from the
sultan, and sollicited Baber, who then reigned in Cabul, to come to the
conquest of Hindostan. The first thing, however, that Dowlat did, was to
obtain from Sultan Baber, Alla ul Dien, the brother of Ibrahim, now in the
service of Cabul. Supporting him, as a cover to his measures, with his
whole force, he reduced the country as far as Delhi. Alla was joined by the
omrahs of those parts, so that his army now consisted of upward of
forty thousand horse, with which he invested Delhi. <PB N="79" REF="86"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1525. Hig. 932.</NOTE>Ibrahim resolved
to march against him, but when he came within six crore of Alla ul Dien's
army, he was surprized by that prince in the night. A confused and
tumultuous fight was maintained to day-light, when Ibrahim found that he was
deserted by some of his omrahs, who had joined Sultan Alla ul Dien. Sultan
Ibrahim ob∣serving, in the morning, that the troops of Alla ul Dien were
dis∣persed, in plundering his camp, rallied a number of his troops, and the
greatest part of his elephants, returned to the attack, and drove him off the
field, with great slaughter. Ibrahim entered Delhi in triumph, and Alla ul
Dien, seeing no hopes of reducing it, re∣treated to Punjaab.</P>
<P>In the year nine hundred and thirty two, Zehir ul Dien Ma∣hummud
Baber drew his army against Ibrahim, as will be hereafter related at large,
overthrew him in the field of Panniput, deprived him of his life and kingdom,
and transferred the empire to the family of Timur. Sultan Ibrahim reigned
twenty years.</P>

Baber had taken the place by capitulation, and forbad all manner of plunder,
the army, to whom he was greatly in arrears, and who served him only for the

Ibrahim Chan Begehuck, went off in a body, and were followed by several other
chiefs, with their whole dependents, to Achsi, where Jehangire, the brother
of Baber, commanded. Jehangire, by the aid of the deserters, and that of a
prince, called Ozin Hassen, declared himself king of In∣dija. He wrote,
by way of sneer to his brother, that as Baber had subdued the kingdom of
Samarcand, he begged to be indulged with that of Indija.</P>

resented this behaviour, by abandoning him, and joining his brother. Baber,

cut him to pieces.</P>

rather than his paternal dominions, and accordingly directed his march
homewards. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Indija taken.</NOTE>But Ali Doost, and his

of Mahmood. That sultan hastened to Jilka, where he and Baber met; but an
emissary, at the same time, came to Mahmood, from Jehangire, who managed
matters so well, that Sultan Mahmood left his two nephews to settle their

that the place in which he was then could not protect him from the fury of his
enemies;

earnestly solicited him to permit him to pass the winter at Bishaer.
Mahummud Hassein consented to this request; and Baber accordingly took
up his quar∣ters there. He began to recruit a new army, writing to all the
friends he could think of, to join him.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">He takes the field with a few.</NOTE>After a
few were gathered round his standard, he considered that his future fortune
depended entirely upon the reputation of his arms, and resolved to employ
them against his enemies. He, therefore, hastened to Barnilack, where he
took some forts by assault, and some by stratagem. But these petty
exploits were of little service to him, for his affairs bore still a very
ruinous aspect, which threw him into great perplexity.

<P>Baber did not hesitate to accept this offer, and arriving at the
place, he met Alli Doost at the gate, who put him into possession of

the fourth day after the arrival of Baber, he set out for Achsi, where Ozin
Hassen capitulated, and was permitted to retire to Hissaar, Casim

they marched towards Ouse. The king having recruited his army, marched, in
the year nine hundred and five, towards Ouse,

and the districts of Orgund, should re∣main to Baber; that if the latter
should ever recover the kingdom of Samarcand, he should give up Indija to

sides were set at liberty. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The inso∣lence of Ali Doost.</NOTE>The king
returned to Indija, where Alli Doost, who was a man of great wealth and
power, had began to exert unbounded authority. He banished some, and
imprisoned others, without the king's permission; while his son,
Mahummud Doost, took a princely state upon himself. The king, upon
ac∣count of his great influence, and the numerous enemies which envi∣roned his
dominions, was constrained to dissemble his resentment.</P>
<P>In the mean time, Mahummud Mazidlir Chan, an omrah of Sultan Alli
Mirza of Samarcand, apprehensive of danger from his master, joined Bijaan
Mirza, the son of Sultan Mahmood, and carried him against Samarcand. Bijaan
Mirza was defeated, returned, and sent an embassador to Baber, inviting

<NOTE PLACE="marg">Obliged to retreat.</NOTE>Baber, as his scheme
was not ripe for execution, thought it high time to make his escape, which he
did accordingly, without any loss.</P>
<P>After he had got clear of the city, he looked back and repented of
his precipitate flight. He immediately stopped in a grove, where, being
wearied with the fatigue of the day, he laid himself down upon the ground to
sleep, as did the greatest part of his retinue. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">His dream.</NOTE>In about an hour he awaked from

The king begged he would excuse him, as the offence was com∣mitted by a

towards the sky, upon which he awoke, and call∣ing up his attendants, related
his dream, and determined to make an attempt immediately upon Samarcand.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Returns to Samarcand which he

of a hook-rope, and coming round to the gate and falling upon the guard
commanded by Casiter Chan, killed and dispersed them. They immediately
set open the gate, and admitted the king and his small party. The city was
alarmed; but the party proclaiming the name of Baber as they passed through
the streets, all who were his friends flocked to him, while his enemies, not

<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1500. Hig. 906.</NOTE>knowing his
strength, ran distracted from place to place to join their leaders.</P>
<P>In a short time the alarm reached the house of Chaja Cuttub ul
Dien Eiah, where seven thousand Usbecks were quartered. They rushed out
and joined Shubiani Chan, who, with eight thousand Ushecks, lay in the
citadel of Didar. Shubiani, with one hundred and fifty men, commanding the
rest to wait for orders, set out for the iron gate, but seeing he could
do nothing with that handful, he retreated. Baber, in the mean time, attended
by some thousands, who rent the sky with acclamations, followed him so
close, that Shubiani Chan could not, either by words or example, make one of
the Usbecks stand his ground 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Samarcand submits.</NOTE>He therefore followed
them out at the opposite gate, and fled towards Bochara, and Samarcand
imme∣diately submitted to Baber.</P>
<P>This action, if we consider the strength of the place, the
troops it contained, the alarm that had been spread in the evening, the
small number who attempted it, the uncertainty of being joined by the
citizens, and many other difficulties, we must esteem it equal to the
boldest enterprize in history. The authors who relate it, very justly
give it the preference to any of the exploits of Timur.</P>
<P>Mahummud Musidter Chan took this opportunity of wresting the
forts of Kirshi and Heraz from the Usbecks; while Abul Hassen Mirza,
from Muracuss, came and took Kole. Sultan Baber sent ambassadors to
Sultan Hassein Mirza, and other neighbouring princes, his relations, to
request their alliance, to drive Shubiani Chan out of Maver ul Nere. They
either paid no regard to Baber's ambassy, or sent such pitiful
supplies, as served no purpose. Shu∣biani, by this means, recovered
strength during the winter, taking Karacole, and other districts.</P>

advanced, and laid siege to the city; the king taking up his quarters at the

for many days, numbers being killed on both sides; during which time, Kutch
Beg, Loma Kokultass, and Kelnizer Taghai, gave extraordinary examples of
bravery. Four months had now passed in attacking and repulsing, when a
dreadful famine began to rage in the city. The inhabitants eat their horses,
and even the most unclean animals, while those who could not procure other
provisions, subsisted upon the bark of trees.</P>
<P>Though the king, at the commencement of the siege, had sent

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Besieged at Artaba by Shubiani.</NOTE>But in
the beginning of the spring, he was again attacked by Shubiani Chan, who, not
being able to effect any thing against the city, plundered the country, and
retreated to Samarcand. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">His misfor∣tunes.</NOTE>In this manner, the
sultan, unable to raise his head from his misfortunes, lived for some
time, Ahmed Timbol having taken possession of the kingdom of Indija,
which Baber had resigned to his brother Jehan∣gire, upon his taking
Samarcand.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Aided by his uncles.</NOTE>Sultan Mahmood Chan,
and his brother, Sultan Ahmed Chan, were at length prevailed upon to support
Baber in an attempt to recover the kingdom of Indija from Ahmed Timbol. When
the confederates had reached the boundaries of Ferghana, Ahmed Timbol marched
out to oppose them. It was agreed, that Sultan Baber, with a small
detachment of Moguls, should march towards Osh, to raise a party there,
whilst his uncles opposed Ahmed Tim∣bol. Baber accordingly took Osh, and
was joined by some of the inhabitants of Orgun and Marinan, who expelled the
garrisons of Ahmed Timbol. The king immediately marched towards Indija; and
Ahmed Timbol decamped from before the confederate princes, and hastened back
to cover Indija.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Defeated by Timbol.</NOTE>Timbol happened, by
accident, to fall in with Baber's camp, when the troops were out foraging, and
defeated him. The king escaped, wounded, to Osh, while Ahmed Timbol threw
himself into Indija, and prepared for a defence.

<P> <PB N="93" REF="100"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1502. Hig. 908.</NOTE>In the mean time,
Shubiani Chan, fearing the success of Baber, advanced from Samarcand with a
very great army, towards Achsi. Baber immediately joined his allies, and they
prepared to receive him. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Totally de∣feated by Shubiani.</NOTE>But in this
action, which was very obstinate and bloody, the fortune of Shubiani Chan
prevailed, and both the uncles of Baber were taken prisoners. The King
escaped to Mogulistan, and the king∣dom of Tashcund fell into the hands
of Shubiani Chan, which greatly augmented his power.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Sultan Ba∣ber's uncles
released.</NOTE>Shubiani, some time after, released the two brothers, but
Sultan Mahmood retired, and fell into a deep melancholy. When one of his
friends told him, that Shubiani Chan had poisoned him, and begged to supply
him with some famous Theriac of Chitta, as a powerful antidote against
poisons; the prince replied, 
<Q REND="inline">"Yes! Shu∣biani Chan has poisoned me, indeed! he
has taken my kingdom, which is not in the power of your Theriac to
restore."</Q></P>
<P>Sultan Baber left Mogulistan, and came to Shudma, and from
thence proceeded to Turmuz, where Amir Mahummud Backer, prince of that place,
who was uneasy at the great power of the Us∣becks, glad of Baber's
alliance, who still had the command of an army, received him with great
kindness and respect, and gave him large presents. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">He asks ad∣vice of Ma∣hummud

the foot-ball of fortune, and like a piece of wood on a chess-board, moved
from place to place, vagrant as the moon in the sky, and restless as a
stone upon the beach, he would therefore be glad of his friendly advice, as
he had been so unsuccessful in his own resolves. Meer Mahummud Backer
replied, That, however inca∣pable he was to advise him, he would not withold
his opinion, which was, that, as Shubiani Chan was now in full
possession of Baber's kingdom, and many others, which rendered him
extremely powerful, it would be more adviseable for him to pursue his

<P>The king followed this advice, and, in the year nine hundred and
ten, marched towards Cabul. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Baber's in∣gratitude to Chusero
Shaw.</NOTE>Passing, in his way, through the do∣minions of Chusero Shaw
of Kunduz, he was entertained by him with great hospitality, for which, we
are sorry to relate, our hero made a very bad return. During the time that
Baber resided there, he stirred up a faction in Chusero's court, and
gained over seven thousand of his troops to his own interest. This plot
being disco∣vered, Chusero, with a few servants, was obliged to abandon
his capital and fly to Biddiulzeman Mirza, leaving his troops, his trea∣sure,
and every thing in the possession of Baber.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Marches to∣wards Cabul.</NOTE>Baber did not
fail to avail himself of these advantages. He march∣ed immediately towards
Cabul, which had been in possession of Mirza Abdul Rysaac, the son
of Mirza Aligh Beg, Baber's uncle, who was then in his minority. One Zicca,
exerting too much authority in the country at that time, disgusted the
other omrahs, who assassinated him in the month of Zihidge. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Confusions of that coun∣try.</NOTE>This
circumstance occasioned great convul∣sions in the kingdom; for Mahummud
Mokîm, the son of Amir Zulnôn, Prince of Garrimsere, took
advantage of the intestine divi∣sions of the Cabulians, and invaded them,
forcing Mirza Abdul Ry∣sac to take shelter among the Afghâns: 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Baber seizes upon Cabul∣istan.</NOTE>he
himself took possession of that country, and married the sister
of the former prince.</P>
<P>Affairs being in this situation, Sultan Baber arrived upon the
borders of Cabul, and driving Mahummud Mokîm out of the field, forced him
to take refuge in his capital, which Baber besieged and took. He then applied
himself to regulate and improve that coun∣try, as dominions belonging to
himself.</P>

dreadful earthquakes which laid most of the cities in ruins. Baber
endeavoured to alleviate this public calamity in such a manner, by his

fidelity of all his new subjects.</P>
<P>The restless genius of Baber could not lie quiet. His
aspiring dis∣position began to extend his views to conquest. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Baber in∣vades Canda∣har.</NOTE>He accordingly
led an army against the Argôns of Kandahar, and deprived them of the

Baddiulze∣mân of Herât. He marched in the same year to
Kussluckát, which he brought into subjection, and gave the
government of Ghizni, which, from a great empire, was diminished into an
inconsiderable province, to his brother Jehangire.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Marches to Chorrasân.</NOTE>In the year
nine hundred and twelve, Baber marched towards Chorrasân to join Sultan
Hussein Mirza, who, ashamed of his former behavior, and irritated, by
fresh injuries from Shubiani Chan, now proposed to Baber, that they
should join in alliance against him. But when Baber had reached
Nîmrosa, he heard of Sultan Hussein's death. He proceeded, however,
to Chorrassân, and endeavored to stir up the princes and omrahs
against the Usbecks. He was not able to effect his purpose, and he
therefore returned, by the way of Herât, towards Cabul. The snows were,
at that time, very deep, and prevented his passage over the hills, which
obliged him to cantoon his troops in Hazara.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Disturbances in Cabul.</NOTE>When Baber was
thus constrained to remain at Hazara, Mahum∣mud Hassein Gurgan,
Birlass, and other Mogul omrahs, joining with Chan Mirza his cousin,
raised him to the throne of Cabul, by promoting false intelligence of the
sultan's death. But when the news of his return reached the people, they
rebelled against the new government, and as soon as the season
permitted his approach, <PB N="96" REF="103"/>

in the revolt, were expelled the country. About this time Nasir Mir∣za, the
sultan's youngest brother, who held the government of Baduchshan, being
defeated, by one of the generals of Shubiani Chan, took refuge at Cabul, and,
as Mirza Jehangire had killed himself by hard drinking, his government of
Ghizni was now con∣ferred upon Nasir Mirza.</P>
<P>In the year nine hundred and thirteen, Baber marched against the
Afghans of Ghalingi, who infested his country, and took from them one hundred
thousand sheep, and some thousands of other cattle, and returned. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Baber invited to Candahar.</NOTE>The omrahs of
the house of Argôn, being greatly oppressed by the Usbecks, wrote
to Baber, at this time, that if he would march that way, they would put him in
possession of Candahar. The sultan did not hesitate to comply with
their request. He immediately set out, and, as he was pas∣sing
Kilât, Chan Mirza begged the favor of being admitted into his presence,
and, receiving his pardon, accompanied him. When he had reached the borders of
Candahâr, he wrote to Shaw Beg and Mahummud Mokêm, that he was so
far upon his way, ac∣cording to their desire, and that, therefore, he
expected to see them in his camp.</P>
<P>Since the time of their writing to Baber, some alterations in
their politicks, had made them repent of the application they had made, so
that instead of receiving the sultan in a friendly manner, they prepared
for war, and desired he would return home. But the sultan determined not to
suffer such an indignity with impunity. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Takes Can¦dahar.</NOTE>He marched forward, and

divided, by weight, amongst his officers and troops, according to their
respective stations. He left Nasir Mirza in the government of Candahar
and Dawir, and then returned in triumph to Cabul.</P>
<P>Mahummud Mokîm having, this very year, complained to
Shu∣biani Chan, prevailed upon him to engage in his behalf, and to march
towards Candahar. Nasir Mirza, upon receiving this intel∣ligence, shut
himself up in the town, and sent expresses to his brother for
assistance. Baber wrote him to defend the place as long as he could, but
if he should be driven to great distress, to capitulate, and come to him
at Cabul; for that, at this time, he was in no condition to dispute the field
with Shubiani Chan, whose forces and finances were greatly superior;
besides, that a defeat might ruin him for ever, and overset all the
projects he had formed of raising himself a kingdom in Hindostan. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">which is retaken by Shubiani.</NOTE>Nasir
Mirza, accord∣ing to these instructions, after he could hold out no longer

after taking the place, gave it back to the sons of Zulnôn, and marched
with his army towards Chorrassân. But no sooner had Shubiani
evacuated Candahar, than the Arguniahs made an in∣cursion, and
possessed themselves of the place. This was an agree∣able piece of

carried to the field, Baber had now scarce five hundred remaining in his
camp.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">His daring enterprize.</NOTE>Notwithstanding
of these misfortunes, Baber boldly resolved to advance towards Cabul, with
the few trusty friends he had left. Abdul Rysaac, upon the sultan's
approach, came out of the city with an army ten or twelve thousand strong.
The sultan, with his small troop, advanced towards them, and when he came
near, ordered them to halt. He himself rode close up to the rebel-army, and
challenged Adbul Rysaac to fight;

<P>This heroic behavior struck the rebels with so much admiration

mother, Sha Begum, who traced her genealogy to the great Secunder<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Alexander the Great.</NOTE>, began to entertain hopes, and to take
measures to raise himself to that kingdom. Having previously obtained

kept him under guard. Eusoph Alli Kockultash, who had been an old servant
of Mirza, formed a conspiracy against Zeiper, and assassinated him,
and Chan Mirza was raised to the throne by the people.</P>
<P>In the year nine hundred and sixteen, Shaw Ismaiel Suffavi,
king of Iran, wrote to Shubiani Chan to withdraw his troops from some of the
skirts of his dominions, upon which he had begun to en∣croach, to root up the
tree of contention, which produced bitter fruits, and to plant that of
friendship, whose blossoms shed the most grateful perfume. Shubiani
Chan replied, That it was only for those who were descended from kings to
entertain thoughts of empire; that it was true, that Shaw Ismaiel, though the
son of a Turkuman Fa∣kier, had raised himself to a kingdom, when there
was no lord of seven nations around him, to oppose him; that therefore, it
would be now adviseable for him to retire to his former obscurity, and
that, for that purpose, he sent him a staff and a beggar's dish for his
inheritance; for that Shubiani only was worthy of possessing the bride
of royalty, who durst kiss her through opposing swords.</P>
<P>Ismaiel Suffavi answered, That if empire was an inheritance,
by what means was it so often violated, till it sell to his lot? for his
own part, he had always considered the right of kings as sounded upon
power, and that the longest sword was the best title. That, with the
latter, he was, at all times, ready to dispute with Shubiani; and that,
though he himself had no opinion of contemptuous ostentation, yet in return
for Shubiani's present, he had sent him a gridiron and spinning-wheel for
his amusement. As for the rest, that Ismaiel would be his own
messenger.</P>

Shubiani Chan could make the least opposition. Shubiani not being then
prepared to engage Ismaiel, in the field, he shut himself up in Murve.
But being severely reproached by Shaw Ishmaiel, he marched out and gave him
battle, in which he was defeated. In his flight he had the misfortune to get
into a park, with about five hundred princes and principal officers, from

<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reduces Punjaab.</NOTE>He subdued all the
countries in his way, and crossing the river, advanced to Berah in Punjaab,
raising heavy contributions for with-holding his troops from plunder. He
sent from Berah, Moulana Murshid with an embassy to Sultan Ibrahim,
acquainting him, that as that country had been for many years in the
possession of the house of Timur, it was proper he should now
relinquish his pretensions to it, and so prevent the war from being
carried further into his country.</P>
<P>At this place Baber received advice of the birth of another son,
whom he named Hindal Mirza. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Marches against he Gickers.</NOTE>He appointed
Hassen Beg, go∣vernor of the conquered countries as far as Chinaab, and
marched in person against the Gickers, and besieged the fort of Pirhala,
whither Hati their chief had retired. The Gickers were, one day, tempted to
take the field, and were defeated by Doost Beg, the sul∣tan's general,

was a descendant of the race of that name who heretofore reigned at Delhi. He
gave to Sultan Baber information, that Ismaiel Jelwani, Mai Jelwani, and
other Afghans, were collected at Kharah; that it would, therefore, be
adviseable to dispatch a force against them. The sultan agreed to this
pro∣posal, and prepared to send a detachment that way.

convinced of the truth of this information, ordered Dowlat Chan Lodi, and his
son Ghazi Chan, into confinement. He then crossed the Suttuluz, advanced
to Sirhind, and there released the prisoners, and gave them jagiers. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">escapes.</NOTE>But when they had reached
Sultanpoor, they deserted the camp, and fled to the hills. The sultan, upon
this, gave to Delawir Chan the title of Chan Chanan, and both their jagiers;
but as the father and son's desertion greatly affected Baber's interest
in Hindostan, he thought it no ways adviseable to proceed to Delhi this
year. He, accordingly, returned to Lahore, <PB N="106" REF="113"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1524. Hig. 931.</NOTE>and, having
appointed governors to the different countries in his possession in
Hindostan, set out for Cabul.</P>

his son, Chan Chanan, who had betrayed him, and put him in chains;

with a formidable army to Debalpoor, fought Sultan Alla ul Dien and Baba
Kiska, and defeating them, subdued that country. Sultan Alla ul Dien fled
to Cabul, and Baba Kiska to Lahore. Dowlat Chan sent five thousand
Sirwani Afghans against Salcot, but Mir Abdul Aziz, of Lahore, immediately
march∣ed, with what forces he had, to the assistance of Kokiltash, who
held the government of Salcot, and meeting with this detachment of Afghans,
defeated them, and returned to Lahore.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Sultan Ibra∣him attacks him.</NOTE>Much about
this time, an army, on the part of Sultan Ibrahim, of Delhi, marched against
Dowlat Chan and his son. Dowlat turned his army to give them battle, and,
having met them at Bidjwarrah, found means to stir up a faction in his own
favor in the imperial camp, insomuch that such as were not disaffected
were obliged to fly the camp, and return to Ibrahim.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Alla arrives at Lahore.</NOTE>Sultan Alla ul

arrived in Lahore, with orders from Baber to all his omrahs of those parts,
to join him with all their forces, and march towards Delhi, and that he would
support them in person as soon as his affairs at home would permit.
Dowlat Chan and Ghazi Chan Lodi, hearing of this order, wrote to the Mogul
omrahs, that they were glad to find that Sultan Baber espoused the cause
of Alla ul Dien, who was the very person they themselves would chuse to
raise to the throne of Delhi; that if they would, therefore, send him to
them, they would undertake to place him upon the Musmid.</P>

for some time in Cabul, 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Baber's fifth expedition into

used to hunt rhinoceroses, with which that country abounded, and so had
an opportunity of putting the personal bravery of most of his omrahs to
trial, as that was a dangerous and warlike exercise. Many of those animals
were killed, and some taken alive in toils.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Crosses the Sind.</NOTE>Upon the first of

mustered his army, which consisted of only ten thousand choice horse.

<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dowlat taken.</NOTE>Sultan Baber invested
Milwit, and Dowlat Chan, after a few days, capitulated. It seems, that some
days before, he put on two swords, and boasted what he would do to Sultan
Baber. Baber now ordered those two swords to be hung round his neck, and in
that manner Dowlat was brought to his presence; but notwithstanding his
behaviour, the sultan forgave all his crimes, and took him into favor.</P>
<P>When the gates of the fort were opened, the troops pressed in
in an irregular manner, and began to plunder. Baber, upon this, mounted his
horse, and entering, was under the necessity of using violence, to
prevent their outrages. He killed, upon this occasion, a principal officer of
his son Humaioon's retinue, with an arrow, for which he was extremely
grieved, as it happened by mistake. The sultan, by this means, saved the
honor of Dowlat Chan's family, who were all in the place, and preserved a
noble library which he had collected, Dowlat Chan being a poet and a man of
learning. Baber marched from thence the next day, and pursued Ghazi Chan,
when Chan Chanan, Ghazi Chan's brother, found means to escape to him, and was
honorably received. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ghazi de∣feated.</NOTE>Chapihoon Chan, who was

<P>Baber having, in several actions, perceived the inferiority of
the Patan troops to his own, determined to delay no longer his final at∣tempt
upon the empire. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Baber marches to∣wards Delhi.</NOTE>He
accordingly marched towards Delhi, having some letters of encouragement, at
the same time, from a few of the malcontents at the court of Sultan Ibrahim.
When he had <PB N="109" REF="116"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1525. Hig. 932.</NOTE>reached the banks of

<NOTE PLACE="marg">Humaioon defeats a Patan army.</NOTE>Baber,
therefore, sent Humaioon, Kallan Beg, Sultan Duldi, Jehan Beg, Chusero Beg,

the first battle in which prince Humaioon commanded, his fa∣ther was greatly
rejoiced, and gave him the countries of Firosa and Jallender. Two days after,
Meian, an omrah of the party of Ibrahim, appeared in fight, and desired to
join Baber's colours, with three thousand Patan horse, and was accordingly
entertained in his service.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Baber arrives at Shawabad.</NOTE>Baber having
arrived within two stages of Shawabad, received in∣telligence that Sultan

Daood Chan and Hatim Chan, formed his vanguard with twenty seven thousand
horse. The sul∣tan immediately detached Chin Timur Sultan, Muedi Chaja,
Ma∣hummud Sultan Mirza, Adil Sultan Mirza, with all the troops of the left
wing, and the squadrons of Sultan Juneid Birlass, and Shaw Hassein
Birlass, against this advanced post. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Defeats the van of Ibra∣him's army.</NOTE>They

of prisoners, with whom they returned to Baber; but he, we are sorry to
relate such barbarity, put them to death, by way of striking terror into
his enemies.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Preparations for a general
engagement.</NOTE>Baber advancing to the field of battle, encamped there six
days, ordering chains to be made to link the carriages of his guns together, to
prevent the horse breaking through them. The army of Sultan Ibrahim, by this
time, consisted of one hundred thousand horse, and a thousand
elephants; that of Sultan Baber, of thirteen thousand only. When Sultan
Ibrahim had advanced near, Baber ordered five <PB N="110" REF="117"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1525. Hig. 932.</NOTE>thousand horse
to storm his camp in the night; but finding the enemy upon their guard, this
detachment returned without attempt∣ing any thing.</P>
<P>This retreat hastened Sultan Ibrahim to action, and accordingly
he marched next morning to Panniput. Baber, at the same time, ad∣vanced
within six crores of Ibrahim's encampment. Upon the day after, being the
seventh of Rigib, the two armies came in sight of each other. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Baber forms his army into order
battle.</NOTE>Baber divided his troops into two lines, and four grand
divisions, with a body of reserve in the rear of each, and a few light
horse to skirmish in front. The first division on the right was
com∣manded by Prince Humaioon, with the squadron of Chaja Cullan Beg, Sultan
Mahummud Dewilde, Hindo Beg, Willi Beg Chazin, and Pier Kulli Seistani. The
first on the left was under the orders of Mirza Mahummud Sultan, with the
squadrons of Meridi Chaja, Ghazi Sultan, Sultan Suneid Birlass, and Shaw
Hassein Birlass. The second, on the right towards the center, was
commanded by Chin Timur Sultan, Mirza Mahummud Kokultash, and Shaw Munsoor.
The second, to the left towards the center, by Meer Chalifa, Tirdi Beg, and
Mihib Alli Chalifa. Chusero Kokultash, Mahummud Alli Jungjung, and Mirza
Soliman, were appointed to command the light horse, or herawils, in the
front. Abdul Aziz and Bar Tirrah, in the rear of the right, and Kirrah Keri
Bahadur and Willi Kizil, in the rear of the left. Besides which, there was a
reserve in the rear of both lines, that on the right commanded by Malleck
Casim, and that on the left by Alli Bahadur. The king himself took his
post in the centre of the first line, after having personally given
or∣ders to his generals.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibrahim draws out his army.</NOTE>The emperor
Ibrahim, ignorant of the art of war, observed no regular order of battle, but

the Moguls to the Patans, from their known courage and steady order, that the
emperor's unweildy column began to break and turn thin, before they came up to
the charge, which was directed at the center of the Mogul army. Those who
advanced were repulsed with great bravery, but when they sought to retreat,
they found themselves surrounded; for the two bodies of reserve, in the
rear of the Mogul line, had wheeled round their flanks, and meeting in the
center, fell upon the rear of those who had advanced to the charge, by which
means the Afghans were almost all cut to pieces. The reserve having
performed this service, retired to their post in the rear, and the Mogul
lines advanced, sustaining various irregular charges from the Indian army,
whom they repulsed with great slaughter.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Sultan Ibra∣him charges the Moguls in

indignation, ad∣vanced in person, followed by the flower of his army, and
gave such a violent shock to the Mogul line, as threw it into disorder.
Nothing now but personal bravery was left to decide the day; but in this, and
the compact form in which the Moguls whole force was wedged, they were still
superior to the Indians.

the pursuit; but being wearied with slaughter, he gave hope to fear, and
respite to death.</P>
<P>According to the most moderate accounts there were sixteen
thousand Afghans killed in this action, though most of the Indian authors
say fifty thousand. Of the loss of Baber we have no infor∣mation;
conquerors having it always in their power to conceal the number of their
slain.

<P>Sultan Baber did not fail to make the best use of his victory.
He immediately after the battle detached Humaioon, and three of his principal
omrahs, to Agra, before they could have time to recover from their
consternation, or to remove their wealth. He also sent Mahummud Sultan,
and three other omrahs, to Delhi, to take possession of that capital,
while he himself came up in the rear, 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Baber enters Delhi, and assumes the

<NOTE PLACE="marg">Arrives be∣fore Agra,</NOTE>he set out for

invested the fort, which was in possession of the former go∣vernment,

<NOTE PLACE="marg">which sub∣mits.</NOTE>But so much had the

the property of Sultan Alla ul Dien Chilligi. Sultan Baber presented it to
his son Humaioon. Thus, upon the fifth day after his arrival, he was put in
possession of the place, in which he found the mother of Sultan
Ibrahim, who was treated with becoming respect, and permitted to carry away
all her wealth.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Reflexions upon the con∣quest of Hin∣dostan
by Baber.</NOTE>This conquest of Hindostan, as Baber himself writes in
his Com∣mentaries<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The Commentaries of Baber are
still extant, and reckoned one of the best per∣formances of the kind in the
East.</NOTE>, was certainly superior to that of any former conqueror.
Sultan Mahmood of Ghizni was not only a powerful emperor, but the country was,
at that time, divided into a number of kingdoms, which greatly facilitated his
enterprizes. Shab ul Dien Ghori brought an army of one hundred and twenty
thousand men with him, when the king∣dom <PB N="113" REF="120"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1526. Hig. 933.</NOTE>was not so
powerful. The like may be said of Timur, who ra∣vaged Hindostan when it was
torn to pieces by civil commotions. But the army of Sultan Baber was but a
handful in proportion to that of Sultan Ibrahim, who possessed all the
countries between the Sind and Behar, and could bring five hundred thousand
men to the field; while Baber only possessed the poor countries of
Cabul, Buduchshan, and Candahar, the revenues of which were very
inconsiderable.</P>
<P>To what then can we attribute this extraordinary conquest, in a
natural light, but to the great abilities and experience of Baber, the bravery
of his few hardy troops, trained up to war, for their sub∣sistance, and
now fired with the hopes of glory and gain? But what contributed most to
weigh down the scale of conquest, was the de∣generacy of the Patans,
effeminated by luxury and wealth, and dead to all principles of virtue and
honor, which their corrupt factions and civil discords had totally effaced;
it being now no shame to fly, no infamy to betray, no breach of honor to
murther, and no scandal to change parties. When, therefore, the fear of
shame and the love of fame were gone, it was no wonder that a herd, without
unanimity, order, or discipline, should fall into the hands of a few brave
men. This is the general tendency of wealth in all governments, if the reins
are not held fast, the laws punctually executed, and the progress of
corruption checked both by private and public oeconomy.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Baber's ge∣nerosity.</NOTE>Upon the twentieth
of Rigib, Baber went into the treasury, which was very rich. He reserved
not a single dinar for himself, but divi∣ded it among his omrahs and
troops; the share of the former com∣ing to two lacks of rupees each; and
those of others were pro∣portionable to their rank and stations. A part was
sent to Cabul, to be divided among Baber's subjects, which yielded to each
a silver sha∣roch<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A silver sharoch is in value
about a shilling sterling.</NOTE>, besides presents, which he sent to
Samarcand, Chorrassan, <PB N="114" REF="121"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1526. Hig. 933.</NOTE>Kashgur, Ayrac,
Mecca, Medina, Kirbilla, Negif, Mushad, and other holy places, in charity.
This generosity, which bordered upon prodigality, got Baber the name of a
Collinder, whose custom it is to keep nothing for to-morrow.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The provin∣cial omrahs refuse to
sub∣mit.</NOTE>As the Patans were in great terror of the Moguls, and had a
natural antipathy to their government, they still refused to submit, and
appeared every where in arms, strengthening their forts, and erecting the
standard of defiance in their different provinces; Ca∣zim, in Simbol; Alli
Chan Formalli, in Mewat; Mahummud Zeitôn, in Dolepoor; Tatar Chan, in
Gualiêr; Hussein Chan Lo∣hani, in Rhaberi; Cuttub Chan, in Atava;
Allum Chan, in Calpee; Nizim Chan, in Biana; besides Nasir Chan Lohani, and
Maroof Furmalli, on the other side of the Ganges. All these omrahs
refu∣sed to acknowledge Baber's authority. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Raise Ma∣hummud to the throne.</NOTE>But as it
was necessary to form an alliance for their mutual defence, they
unanimously appoint∣ed Par Chan, the son of Diria Chan Lodi, their general,
or, rather, king, by the title of Sultan Mahummud; and, rendezvousing at
Kin∣noge, advanced towards Agra. At the same time, Mai, the Afghan chief, who
had joined Baber, now deserted him, with all his adhe∣rents: even the
inhabitants of the country round Agra, cut off his foraging parties, and
rendered it very difficult for him to support his cavalry, or supply his
troops with provisions: Add to this, the in∣tolerable heat of the weather, by
which a great many Moguls, not being accustomed to such a climate,
died.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Baber's dis∣tressful situa∣tion.</NOTE>In
this situation of affairs, Baber received an address from all his omrahs,
advising him to return to Cabul; to which he replied, That a kingdom which
had cost him so much pains in taking, was not to be wrested from him but
by death alone. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">His resolute behavior.</NOTE>He, at the same
time, issued a proclamation, that he was determined to abide his fate in
Hindostan; but if any person was desirous of returning to Cabul,
preferring safety to glory, and ignoble ease to the manly toils and 
<PB N="115" REF="122"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1526. Hig. 933.</NOTE>dangers of war, they
might retire in peace, and leave him only those whose valor would reflect
honour on themselves, and glory on their king and country.</P>
<P>The omrahs hearing this, were ashamed of their former beha∣vior,
and, striking their breasts, swore they would never forsake him; all,
except Chaja Callân, whose bravery was too well esta∣blished to be
disputed, though he was advised, being at the point of death, to retire to
recover his health. He was appointed governor of Cabul and Ghizni, for the
great services which he had rendered to the king. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Some Patan chiefs come over to his
party.</NOTE>When it was known that Baber had determined not to leave
Hindostan, as his ancestor Timur had done, some om∣rahs, who were willing
to be first in favor, began to come over to him; first, Shech Gurin, with
three thousand horse, from between the rivers, offered his service, which
was accepted. The next was Alli Chan Formalli, from Mewat, to redeem his sons
who had been taken in the battle; then Firose Chan and Shech Baizid Chirmali,
with their whole dependents.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Casim of Simbol sub∣mits.</NOTE>Much about

Kokultash, with a detachment, that way, who engaged Bein, the Afghan, and
defeated him, after which Casim put the Moguls in possession of the
fort. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Humaioon marches against the confederate

to Jionpoor. Humaioon having prevailed upon Fatie Chan, the former emperor's

<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nizam, go∣vernor of Biana, sub∣mits.</NOTE>But
Rana Sinka soon after reduced Nizam to such extremities, that he sent a

sending a force to drive off Rana, Nizam was put in possession of the

received into the sort with a few at∣tendants. He, from time to time,
pretended occasion to send fre∣quent messages in and out; till the

garrison before the entertainment was ended. Saring Chan was told to give up
the place, and threatened with instant death, in case of refusal; so
having satisfied himself of the circum∣stances, he made a virtue of
necessity, and replied, That had he not intended giving up the place to the
king, he would never have been so unguarded as to permit his party to take
this advantage, and ac∣cordingly submitted without resistance, going in
person to Agra, and entered into the king's service. Mahummud Zeiton, at
the same time, arrived from Dolepoor, and had a command conferred upon
him.</P>
<P>Not long after these transactions, Hamid Chan, Saring Chan,
and other Afghans, raised, by a family quarrel, a great disturbance in the
castle of Firosa. The king sent Chin Timur Sultan, Abul Fatte Turkuman,
and others, against them, who chastised both parties.</P>
<P>In the year nine hundred and thirty three, Chajagi Assid, who
had gone ambassador from Cabul to Shaw Tamas of Irack, returned,
accompanied by Solimân, and brought various curiosities. But that which
pleased the king most, was two beautiful female slaves, just come to
maturity, of whom he became greatly enamoured. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An attempt to poison

Ibrahim, who had been before the greatest favo∣rite in the seraglio,
incensed at this change in the sultan's affections, conspired with the

in some hare-soup; but the king, after eat∣ing <PB N="118" REF="125"/>

nauseated the taste, and immediately vomited, which saved his life. After
proper enquiry had been made, the taster and cook denying their knowledge of
any such thing, the king ordered a dog to be brought, who having eat of the

<NOTE PLACE="marg">The conspi∣rators pu∣nished.</NOTE>Two of
the under cooks being also brought to the trial, expired in the same
manner: upon which the taster and head cook, with several of their
assistants, were put to the torture. The plot was discovered, and the
mother of Sultan Ibrahim cast into prison, and all her wealth
confiscated. One of Sultan Ibrahim's sons was sent, at the same time,
to Cabul, where he remained in banishment.</P>

this panic, called, immediately, a council of war. The greatest part of the
officers gave it, as their opinion, that, as the superiority of the enemy was
evident, it was adviseable to leave a strong garrison in Agra, and to
retreat with the bulk of the army to Punjaab.</P>
<P>Baber, with a discontented aspect, fixed his eyes, in
silence, upon the ground. He, at length, sternly asked the omrahs, What
would the world say of a monarch, whom the fear of death should oblige to
abandon such a kingdom? 
<Q REND="inline"><NOTE PLACE="marg">The intrepid conduct of

meet him with honor, face to face, than shrink back, to gain a few years of a
miserable and ignominious existence; for what can we inherit but fame,

halted, and en∣camped his army. Several young warriors, fond of
distinguishing themselves, issued out, under the command of Mahummud
Casim, to skirmish with the enemy's scouts and advanced guards, among
whom they did great execution.</P>
<P>The sultan, next day, advanced another crore, and marked out his
camp at the village of Kava, but his tents were scarcely pitched, 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The enemy advance to attack him.</NOTE>when he
perceived the enemy advancing upon him. He formed his line with great
expedition, in the manner which he had practised for some days before, and,
in a few minutes, was able to receive the shock of battle. The army was
chiefly drawn up by Nizam ul Dien Chalipha, whom Baber reckoned his ablest
general; and this order of battle being, on account of circumstances,
different from the former, we shall relate it at large in this place.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The order of battle.</NOTE>The line which, upon
this occasion was single, consisted of six brigades, exclusive of
the king's life guards in the center, where Baber posted himself. Before
each of the brigades, a few paces in front, the sultan placed a squadron of
light horse, which formed another kind of line with great intervals. In front
of the whole, the artillery and rocket-waggons were drawn up in three
divisions, the right, left, and center. The guns were chained together, so
that there was a kind of fortification formed against the enemy's
cavalry.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Arrangement of the troops.</NOTE>The brigade
immediately to the right of the center, was com∣manded by Chin Timur Sultan,
consisting of his own tribe, and the troops of Soliman Shaw, Shaw Munsur

The bri∣gade to the left of the center was under the immediate orders of Allum

<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prince Hu∣maioon com∣mands the right

charging the right of the Mo∣guls, soon fell in hand to hand, with the

Chin Timur, by the sultan's orders, inclining to the right with his brigade,
took <PB N="122" REF="129"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1526. Hig. 933.</NOTE>up their ground, and
falling upon the assailants with great fury, put them to flight, the light
horse pursuing them with great slaugh∣ter, quite through their own line. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Baber's army surrounded.</NOTE>The enemy, in
the mean time, being so numerous, extended their flanks far beyond the wings
of the sultan, and came down upon him from all sides. Baber ordered his
right and left wing to fall back, by which means his army was thrown into a
circle. In this position he resisted the repeated as∣saults of the
Patans till three o'clock, Alla Kuli Rumi, who com∣manded the artillery, making
great slaughter among them.</P>
<P>Baber finding the enemy fatigued by their repeated assaults,
deter∣mined to act offensively, to drive them quite out of the field. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">He over∣throws the enemy.</NOTE>He therefore put
himself at the head of the brigades of Chin Timur and Allum Chan, and
charging them like a lion rushing from his forest, after an obstinate
resistance put their whole army to flight. Hassen Chan, of Mewat, was
killed with a cannon shot, and Raw Luddive Rai, Chunder Ban Chohan, Mannuk
Chand Chohan, Kirim Sing, all powerful princes of the enemy, were numbered
among the dead.</P>

Raberi. But upon the approach of the Moguls, they fled, and Hassein Chan
was drowned in crossing the Jumna, while Diria Chan escaped. Ma∣hummud
Sultan Mirza was detached at the same time to Kinnoge, against Bein Afghan,
who fled from thence to Cheirabad.</P>
<P>Upon the twenty ninth of Zihidge, in the year nine hundred and
thirty four, the king marched to hunt towards Kole and Simbol. Having diverted
himself with the chace for some time, he returned to his capital, and was
taken ill of a fever, of which however he soon recovered.

arriving at the river, he threw over it a bridge of boats. Chin Timur was
ordered to cross in the front, the enemy being then on the opposite

pursuing them, took part of their baggage, and a great num∣ber of their women

his sickness, to write a poem in praise of Chaja Abud Ahrar, one of the
saints, to induce him to intercede with God for his health. Baber, though it
is highly probable he did not give much credit to the power of the saint,
actually wrote the poem, in the measure of Mowlani Jami, or Rimel

During this festival, Chandamire, the author of the Habib al Sier, Mow∣lana

preparing boats to cross; but Chin Timur begged permission to go before.
As soon as he made his landing good with eighty horse, Mirza Ashkari, who
had crossed at another place, appeared in the enemies rear; and they
imme∣diately took to flight. The king, after this action, left Sultan Ju∣nied
Birlass to prosecute the war in conjunction with Nuserit Shaw, and
returned to pass the rainy season in Agra. He visited, upon his way,
Shech Eiah, at Monier, the father of Shech Sherrif Mo∣niri, and carried him to

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Transactions in Cabul.</NOTE>Humaioon having
left Mirza Hindal to govern in his absence, re∣turned about this time from
Cabul to visit his father. Sultan Seid Chan of Argund, took this opportunity
of invading Buduchshan, and sent Mirza Hyder Dughelaff, to attack Minkilla.
Hindal, upon the approach of the enemy, retreated into the fort of Ziffer,
where he was besieged. Sultan Seid of Argund, finding that he could not
reduce the place, and that the inhabitants would not join him, ravaged the
country, and returned home. But as the news of his retreat had not reached
Agra, the government of Buduchshan was bestowed upon Soliman Mirza, who
set out immediately for that province with a letter from the king to Sultan
Seid Chan, expressing his surprize at hostilities, for which he could
not account, but by some misbehavior of Mirza Hindal; that, therefore, he
had sent another person, who was allied to them both, to supply his
place. When Soliman Mirza arrived, he found the country in perfect
tran∣quillity, and took possession of the government, which his family
have kept to this day. Mirza Hindal returned to Agra.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">His charac∣ter.</NOTE>What shall we say of
Baber, the wonder of the age in which he lived! He mounted a throne at twelve
years of age, and, with va∣rious turns of fortune, reigned thirty eight. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">His huma∣nity and generosity.</NOTE>He was a
prince of great humanity, and he carried his generosity to such excess,
that it bordered upon prodigality. With respect to the first, he so often
pardoned ingratitude and treason, that he seemed to make a princi∣ple of
rendering good for evil. He thus disarmed vice, and made the wicked the
worshipers of his virtue.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">His religion.</NOTE>He was of the sect of the
Hanifites, in whose doctrine and tenets he was perfectly versed; yielding
more to the evidence of reason, than to the marvellous legends of
superstitious antiquity. He was not, however, forgetful of that rational
worship which is due to the great Creator, nor a despiser of those laws
and ceremonies which are founded on found policy for the benefit of the
superficial judges of things. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">His genius for the fine arts.</NOTE>He was a
master in the arts of Poetry, Writing, and Music. He wrote his own
Commentaries in the Mogul language, with such elegance and propriety, that
they are universally admired. This work was translated, in the reign of
Ackbar, by Chan Chanan, into the Persian language, and from it we have
abridged the preceding history of the life of Baber.</P>
<P>In his person, he was something above the middle size,
nervous, and well formed. His countenance was pleasant, and in
dispo∣sition he was easy, facetious, and affable.</P>
<P> <PB N="128" REF="135"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1530. Hig. 937.</NOTE><NOTE PLACE="marg">His justice.</NOTE>To establish his reputation for justice
and honor, we shall relate one instance out of many. When he was prince of
Ferghana, a rich caravan of Chitta and China, which was crossing the
mountains of Indija, was buried in the snow. He ordered all the goods to be
collected, and sent messengers to China to proclaim the accident, and
bring the owners, or their heirs, to his court. Upon their ar∣rival, at the end
of two years, he entertained them hospitably, and returned them all their
goods, not only refusing to accept a present, but even to be reimbursed
for his expences.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Addicted to pleasure.</NOTE>Notwithstanding
his great vigor in war, he was much addicted to wine and women, and all the
fashionable pleasures of courts. He sometimes used, when he had an
inclination to make merry, to fill a fountain with wine, upon which was
inscribed a verse to this pur∣pose: 
<Q REND="inline">"Jovial days! Blooming springs! Old wine, and
young maidens! Enjoy freely, O Baber, for life is not twice to be
en∣joyed!"</Q> He then would sit down in the midst of his friends, drink
freely, and feast his eyes on the daughters of beauty who danced before
him.</P>
<P>Whithersoever he marched, or rode, he always had the road
measured after him. This custom obtains with the emperors of Hin∣dostan
to this day. He made a statute concerning the measurement of distances,
which has hitherto remained in force. He appointed a hundred tinnabs to one
crore, each tinnab being forty guz<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A guz is not quite
an English mile.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">His talents for war.</NOTE>With respect to
his military character, he seems to have had few that could equal him. He
rendered the most dangerous enterprizes easy, by his undaunted courage and
perseverance, which rose above all difficulties, and made him much more the
object of admiration in his adversity, than in the height of his
prosperity. Nor did he for∣get <PB N="129" REF="136"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1530. Hig. 937.</NOTE>himself in the
latter, but always behaved with that moderation and equanimity which
characterizes a great soul.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">His genea∣logy.</NOTE>We have already traced
Baber's descent from Timur; but as he was the founder of a great dynasty,
it will be proper to follow his ge∣nealogy further back into antiquity. The
great Chingez Chan, the son of Pissuka, the son of Pirna, had four
sons of renown, who were all kings, and the fathers of nations. Their names
were Oktai Chaân, Chigittai Chan, Judgi Chan, and Tooli Chan. Though
Oktai Chaân was not the eldest son, yet he was, by his father,
appointed his successor, and ruled in Kirrakerim and Kilwarân,
which were the original territories of Chingez Chan. Oktai Chan died, by
ex∣cess of wine, in the year six hundred and thirty nine.</P>
<P>Chigittai Chan, the second son, possessed the kingdoms
of Maver∣ulnere, Tarkistân, Balich, and Buduchshan, and became the
greatest of the family. Kirrachar Nuain, who was the fifth ancestor of
Timur, was one of his omrahs, and, at length, captain general of all his
forces. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The family of Timur, or Tamerlane</NOTE>The
genealogy of Kirrachar runs thus: Timur, the son of Amir Jiraghai, the son

the son of Kirrachar Nuian, the son of Sagungi, the son of Ibumgi
Berlass, the son of Katchuli Badahur, the son of Jumnai Chan, the son
of Bacsinker Chan, the son of Kidu Chan, who, by the mother's side, was
descended from Basinger, a lady, from whom Chingez Chan derived his
pedigree.</P>

<P>But the urgency of important affairs did not permit Humaioon to
follow long these innocent whims. Such only suited the days of peace, when
the mind might enjoy her harmless follies. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Designs of his brother against him.</NOTE>He
scarcely had ascended the throne, when his brother, Mirza Camiran, who was
then in Cabul, formed a design of making himself master of Punjaab. To
conceal his intentions, he gave out, that he was go∣ing to Hindostan, to
congratulate Humaioon upon his accession. The king being, however, apprized
of Camiran's views, by his be∣havior in those countries through which he
passed, and being ex∣tremely unwilling to make war upon his brother,
consented to let him govern Punjaab, Pishawir, Lemghan, Cabul, Candahar,
and Biana. This effectually stopped the progress of Mirza Camiran. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Promotions.</NOTE>The king, in the mean time,
conferred the government of Mewat upon Mirza Hindal, his brother, and appointed
Mirza Askari to that of Simbol, the other provinces being left in the
possession of the former subas.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Humaioon besieges Callinger.</NOTE>Humaioon,
in the year nine hundred and thirty eight, led an army against the strong
fortress of Callinger, and invested the place. While the king carried on
the siege, Mahmood, the son of Sultan Secunder Lodi, in conjunction with
Bein Afgan, took possession of Jionpoor, and kindled the flames of war
in the east. Humaioon, having received intelligence of these commotions,
decamped from before Callinger, marched to Jionpoor, in a pitched battle
over∣threw the Afghans, and reinstated Juneid Birlass in his former go∣ment
of that province.</P>

refused, the sultan marched his army that way. When Humaioon lay before
Chinâr, he was informed, that Sultan Bahadur, of Guzerat, had turned
to∣wards him the points of his spears. This obliged him to patch up a kind of
a peace with Shere Chan, and to return towards Agra. Cuttub Chan, the son of
Shere Chan, whom the emperor had taken as an hostage, found means, on the
way, to make his escape, and to return to his father at Chinâr.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A conspiracy discovered.</NOTE>Mahummud
Ziman Mirza, the grandson of Sultan Hussein Mirza, aspired to the
throne, and was supported in his pretensions by the omrahs of Chigittai.
The plot was discovered, and the leader of the conspiracy pardoned: But
Humaioon finding him, a second time, meditating treasonable practices, he
ordered him to be confined in the fortress of Biana. Orders were given to put
out the eyes of Mahummud Sultan and Nuherit Mirza, for being the principal
abet∣tors of the prince's ambitious designs; but the person to whom it was
intrusted to inflict this punishment, saved the eyes of the for∣mer,
while the latter found means to escape to Guzerat. Mahum∣mud Sultan, by the
aid of his sons Ali Mirza and Shaw Mirza, who formed a party, was carried
away to Kinnoge, where he was joined by about six thousand Moguls, Afghans,
and Rajaputs.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rebellion at Kinnoge.</NOTE>Humaioon sent to
Bahadur, the governor of Kinnoge, and com∣manded him to deliver up Mahummud,

considerable sum of money, to Bahadur, which induced him to raise the

Mendu, and other places, began to shew his contempt of Humaioon, by advancing
the conspirator Mahum∣mud to great honors. He also prompted Sultan Alla ul

himself of the throne of Delhi.

with which he subdued Biana, and advanced to the environs of Agra.</P>
<P>This pressing danger awaked the king from his lethargy. He
im∣mediately sent Mirza Hindal, with a force, to oppose Tatar Chan. When
the armies approached one another, there was so great a de∣sertion from
Tatar's troops, that, in the space of ten days, ten thousand horse
scarce remained to him. He however resolved, with these, to stand his
ground, and give battle to the imperial army,

founded the miserable witticism contained in the verses. The words were, 
<Q REND="inline">"O thou plunderer of the city of Chitor! <HI>in

began the pun is most to blame.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Calls a coun∣cil of war.</NOTE>Sultan Bahadur,
after sending the above billet to Humaioon, called a council of war. It was
the opinion of the majority, that as Hu∣maioon had all his force with him, it
were better to raise the siege, and march against him, and thus to take
up the war by the roots. Others urged, that Humaioon was so rigid in his
religious princi∣ples, that he would not disturb them in their war with
idolaters; that therefore it was most adviseable to finish the siege,
which was now far advanced, and afterwards to think of other matters.</P>
<P>Bahadur himself favoured the latter opinion. The siege was
ac∣cordingly continued; and Humaioon, piquing himself upon his re∣ligious
principles, continued loitering at Saringpoor, till Sultan Ba∣hadur had taken
the fort.

from risquing an attack, and both armies continued in sight of one another
for the space of two months. Daily skirmishes were, in the mean time,
fought, with various success.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Humaioon cuts off his
supplies.</NOTE>Humaioon, finding that he could not draw Bahadur out of his
trenches, employed all his attention to cut off his supplies. He or∣dered his
horse, in successive bodies of five or six thousand, to scour the
rear of the enemy, by which means famine began soon to be severely felt in
their camp; men, horses, elephants, and camels, pe∣rishing daily in great
numbers.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cowardice and flight of Bahadur.</NOTE>Bahadur,
instead of making one brave effort to relieve himself, permitted base
fear and despair to seize upon him; and, with only five friends, left his
camp in the night, and fled towards Mindu. This was no sooner known, than the
flight became general; the chiefs dispersing themselves, with their
adherents. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">His army is routed, and he him∣self besieged
in Mindu.</NOTE>Humaioon, in the morning, ordered the pursuit to commence,
which was continued, as far as Mindu, with great slaughter of the unfortunate
wretches, who had neither the power to escape, nor the means to defend
them∣selves. Bahadur threw himself into Mindu, and the place was closely
invested.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mindu taken by surprize.</NOTE>In a few days,
three hundred Moguls scaled the walls of Mindu, in the night; and though the

all betook themselves to flight. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bravery of Humaioon and Sidder

Guzerat, while Sidder Chan, his Amir ul Omrah, who was dangerously wounded,
not able to proceed farther, shut himself up in the sort of Sunkar,
where, being besieged, he capitulated the second day, and was, on account
of his excellent character, received into great favor. Sidder Chan, during the
pursuit, saved Sultan Bahadur, <PB N="137" REF="145"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1534. Hig. 941.</NOTE>when almost taken
by Humaioon, by throwing himself in between the kings, till his master had
an opportunity of making his escape. But he himself was attacked with
such violence by the king, in person, that, after receiving many wounds, he
got off with great difficulty.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Humaioon pursues Sul∣tan Bahadur.</NOTE>The
king, three days after the taking of Mindu, renewed the pursuit after Sultan
Bahadur, who, having taken all his treasure and jewels out of Mahummud Abad
and Chapanier, fled towards Amu∣dabad. The king, giving up the city of
Chapanier to plunder, and committing the siege of the citadel, which still
held out, to Dowlat Chaja Birlass, continued to pursue Bahadur. The
unfortunate sul∣tan, hearing of his approach, fled to Cambait, but Humaioon
pur∣suing him thither, he retired to the island of Deo, Humaioon ar∣riving
in Cumbait, the very evening of the same day in which Ba∣hadur forsook
it.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Returns to the siege of
Chapanier.</NOTE>Humaioon remained a few days in this place, but hearing that
the sultan's wealth was mostly in the citadel of Chapanier, he re∣turned to
carry on that siege. Achtiar Chan, who commanded in the place, defended it
with great bravery. But though he had some years provision in the fort, he
was covetous of more, and took in daily supplies from a certain part of the
citadel, which was covered by a thick wood.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">His strata∣gem.</NOTE>The king, one day,
reconnoitring the place, observed the pro∣ceedings of Achtiar Chan, with
regard to the provisions. He im∣mediately seized upon a party of country
people who carried the supplies through the woods. He persuaded, or rather
commanded them, to carry him, in disguise, to the place. They had
admit∣tance. The king made the necessary remarks, returned to his camp, and
the same night ordered a parcel of iron spikes to be made.</P>
<P> <PB N="138" REF="146"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1535. Hig. 942.</NOTE><NOTE PLACE="marg">Be a gallant exploit, takes Cha∣panier.</NOTE>He himself, with
three hundred select men, went to the place, while feigned attacks were made
upon every other quarter of the fort. As the access to this part of the
fortress was extremely diffi∣cult, the attention of the enemy was entirely
drawn towards the different assaults. This furnished the king with an
opportunity of fixing his iron spikes in the wall, by which means thirty-nine
officers mounted, and the king himself made the fortieth. Before sun-rise
his whole detachment was within the walls, when he displayed a signal which
had been previously settled with his troops. They ac∣cordingly made a
violent assault upon all sides, and Humaioon, in the mean time, at the
head of his detachment, cried out, Alla Akbar!<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">That is,
God is greatest.</NOTE> and forcing his way, sword in hand, through the
enemy, possessed himself of one of the gates: he immediately opened
it, and admitted his troops, and all, except Achtiar Chan and his fa∣mily, who
were in an outwork, were put to the sword. The go∣vernor defended himself
so bravely, that he obtained a capitu∣lation.</P>
<P>The great strength of this place, the numerous garrison, and
the boldness of the attempt by which it fell, rendered this action of the
king, equal, in the opinion of all mankind, to any thing of the like nature
recorded in history. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Divides the spoil among his troops.</NOTE>Here
the treasure of Guzerat, which had been collected in the course of many
years, was distributed among the troops. He gave to the officers and

strength, and marched, with an army, towards Ahmedabad.</P>
<P>Humaioon, in the mean time, invested Chinar, and reduced it,
after a siege of six months. Having then gained the passes, he en∣tered
Bengal. Shere Chan, in the mean time, carried away the treasure of the
princes of Gour and Bengal, whom he had reduced, and fled to the mountains of
Jarcund. The king continued his march to Gour, the capital of Bengal, took it,
and commanded it to be called Ginnitabad<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The

the King's brother, was sent to suppress Mahum∣mud Sultan Mirza, who, we
have already observed, had escaped to Kinnoge. But instead of performing
that service, he, as soon as he saw himself at the head of an army,
began to aspire to the throne. He accordingly marched back to Agra, where he
discovered his treasonable intentions, by putting some of the principal
people, who rejected his authority, to death. He thus enforced obedience, and
throwing away every disguise, ordered the chutba to be read in his own
name, and, with all the ensigns of royalty, marched to Delhi, and besieged
it.</P>
<P>The king, having heard of these proceedings, left Jehangire Beg
and Ibrahim Beg to command in Bengal, and hastened towards Agra. When he was
about half way, Mahummud Zeman Mirza, who had formerly joined Sultan Bahadur,
returned from Sind, and, being promised a pardon, joined the king with a
considerable party. In the mean time, Shere Chan, finding the king's army
so much weakened by sickness and desertion, and his affairs further
per∣plexed by the rebellion of Mirza Hindal, marched with his troops from
Rotas, and came behind the king on the Jossa<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Perhaps the Sone, or Carimnassa.</NOTE>. Both armies lay three
months inactive, at a time when the king ought to have run all hazards, being

at Delhi, Mirza Hindal prevailed upon him, to join his forces with his own,
after which they both continued the siege.</P>
<P> <PB N="141" REF="149"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1539. Hig. 946.</NOTE>Fuchir ul Dien Alli,
who commanded in the city, acquainted Mirza Camiran, that he could never think
of betraying his trust, and rather than be so ungrateful to his prince, he
was determined to hold out to the last drop of his blood; but, that, if he
would first possess himself of the capital of Agra, and entirely
subdue his bro∣ther, he would then, and not till then, give up the city of
Delhi. When Mirza Camiran and his brother found him so determined, and that
the siege would cost them much blood and time, they set out together for
Agra.</P>
<P>When they had reached the environs of that city, the jealousy,
which the brothers naturally entertained of each other, the eyes of both being
turned towards the throne, broke out into open war. Mirza Hindal, being
deserted by many of his party, fled to Alwir, with five thousand horse,

Humaioon endeavored, by every possible argument with his brothers, to bring
about a coalition of interests against Shere Chan, telling them, that their
family quarrels would certainly, in the end, lose them that mighty empire,
which had cost their father so much pains to conquer, and involve the
family of Chigittai in one common ruin; that it was, therefore, adviseable to
join against the common enemy, and afterwards divide the empire amongst
themselves. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">They reject his proposals.</NOTE>These
arguments had no weight with his brothers, who were so blinded by ambition,
that they were determined ra∣ther to lose all, than be contented with a part.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Treachery of Shere Chan.</NOTE>When the
conditions were signed and ratified by mutual oaths, Humaioon, trusting too
much to the faith of his enemy, permitted a free intercourse between both
armies. This was what the per∣fidious Shere Chan aimed at by the peace. He
accordingly, next morning, surprized the sultan's camp, before day-break,
and totally defeated him. As the bridge of boats, which the sultan had been
preparing, was not finished, there was no way of escape left, but by
plunging into the river; all the boats being seized by a part of the enemy,
who had turned the rear of the emperor's army.

resolution he was very much instigated by Chaja Callan Beg. Sultan Humaioon
used every argument to prevent his departure; but the ambitious Camiran was
deter∣mined to be every thing himself, or to give no assistance to his

driven to extremities, requested Mirza Eadgar to join him, with what forces
he had in Bicker; but this ungrateful man chose rather to be prevailed upon
to join Mirza Shaw Hassein, who promised him his daughter, and to
secure him in his government. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">He slies to∣wards Bicker.</NOTE>He immediately
deserted the king's interest, at this dangerous crisis, and Humaioon was
obliged to retreat precipitately from before Sewan, towards Bicker.

obtain, in that place, a few boats, from his own per∣fidious subjects, to

wandering along the banks, he discovered some boats that had been sunk,
raised them, and transported his troops to the other side.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Eadgar Nasir

Humaioon had strength enough left to strike terror in Eadgar Nasir Mirza,
who, to avoid his resentment, came and made his submission. The

Humaioon's clemency, he began to raise sedition among his troops, and
privately to draw them over to his own interest. This treason being
commu∣nicated to the king, the traitor, upon being taxed with it, appeared at
the head of his troops, in open rebellion. But the principal officers of the

prevented, when both parties were formed in order of battle.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Humaioon obliged to fly.</NOTE>The king being
in no condition, at that juncture, to contend with the rebel, thought it high
time to provide for his own safety else∣where. He therefore marched, by the
way of Jasselmere, to Raja Maldeo, then the most potent Hindoo prince in
Hindostan, having before received an invitation from him. But as he was
passing through the territories of Jasselmere, the raja of that country
sent a force to oppose him. The king defeated them, and passed on to
the boundaries of Maldeo, where he halted, and sent a messenger to the
raja.</P>

seeing he had nothing to fear from Humaioon, sound in his own mind no

formerly lived under Humaioon, having intelligence of this design,
immediately informed the king.</P>

fled towards Amercot, which is about one hundred crores from Tatta. His
horse, on the way, falling down dead with fatigue, he desired Tirdi Beg,
who was well mounted, to let him have his; but so ungene∣rous was this man,
and so low was royalty fallen, that he refused to comply with his
request. The troops of the raja being close to his heels, he was
necessitated to mount a camel, till one Nidim Koka, dismounting his own

that the only bucket they had, took a great deal of time in being wound up, and
therefore a drum was beat to give notice to the caffilas when the bucket
appeared, that they might repair by turns to drink. The people were so
impatient for the water, that as soon as the first bucket appeared, ten or
twelve of them threw themselves upon it, before it quite reached the brim of
the well, by which means the rope broke, and the bucket was lost, and
several fell headlong after it. When this fatal accident happen∣ed, the
screams and lamentations of all became loud and dreadful. Some lolling out
their tongues, rolled themselves, in agony, on the hot sand; while others,
precipitating themselves into the well, met with an immediate, and
consequently an easier death. What did not the unhappy king feel, when he
saw this terrible situation of his few faithful friends!</P>
<P>The next day, though they reached water, was not less fatal than
the former. The camels, who had not tasted water for several days, now
drank so much, that the greatest part of them died. The people also,

<HEAD>SECTION II. History of SHERE SHAW, before his accession
to the imperial throne.</HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1542. Hig. 949.</NOTE><NOTE PLACE="marg">Shere Shaw's family,</NOTE>THE original name of Shere Shaw was
Ferîd. His father was Hassin, of the Soor tribe of the Afghans of
Roh. When Sultan Beloli placed his foot on the musnud of empire, the
grand∣father of Shere Shaw, Ibrahim Soor, came to Delhi in quest of mi∣litary
service.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">of the Af∣ghans of Roh.</NOTE>The original
seat of the Afghans was Roh. This word, in their language, signifies a
mountainous country. It extended, they say, in length, from Sewad and Bijore,
to the town of Sui in the domi∣nions of Buckurast, and in breadth, from
Hussin Abdal to Rabul. This tract, in its fertile vallies, contained many
separate tribes; among the number of these was that of Soor, who derive
themselves from the princes of Ghor. One of the sons of the Ghorian family,
whose name was Mahummud Soor, having left his native coun∣try, placed
himself among the Afghans of Roh, and was the father of the tribe of Soor,
which was esteemed the noblest among them.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibrahim Soor arrives at Delhi,</NOTE>Ibrahim
Soor, arriving at Delhi, engaged himself in the service of an omrah of the
court of Beloli. When the empire fell to Se∣cunder, Jemmal Chan an omrah was
appointed suba of Jionpoor, who took Hassen, the son of Ibrahim, in his
retinue. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">his son Hassin obtains a ja∣gier.</NOTE>He
found him a youth of parts, and favored him so much, that, in a short time,
he gave him the pergunnahs of Schsarâm and Chawasspoor Tanda, in
jagier, for which he was to maintain five hundred horse. Hassen had eight
sons; Ferîd and Nizâm of one mother, of a Pa∣tan family; the
other sons were born of slaves.</P>
<P> <PB N="151" REF="159"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1542. Hig. 949.</NOTE><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ferîd flies from his fa∣ther's house.</NOTE>Hassen had
no great love for his wife, and he therefore neglected her sons. Ferîd,
upon this, left his father's house, and enlisted himself a soldier in
the service of Jemmal Chan. Hassen wrote to Jemmal Chan<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sub<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of Jionpoor</NOTE>
upon this occasion, requesting him to send back his son, that he might
be educated. But all that Jemmal Chan could say had no effect upon
Ferîd. Jionpoor, he said, was a better place for instruction than
Sehsaram; 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Applies him∣self to letters.</NOTE>and he
affirmed that he would at∣tend to letters of his own accord. This he did to
so much purpose, that he soon could repeat the works of Shech Sadi, and
was, be∣sides, a proficient in all the learning of the country. He, however,
employed most of his time in history and poetry, being supported by the
liberality of Jemmal Chan.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Is reconciled with his fa∣ther,</NOTE>After
three or four years had passed, Hassen came to Jionpoor, and, by the
mediation of friends, the father and son were reconci∣led. Hassen gave
Ferîd the charge of his jagier, and remained himself at Jionpoor.
Ferîd, when he took leave of his father, said, 
<Q REND="inline">"That the stability of government depended on
justice, and that it would be his greatest care not to violate it, either
by oppressing the weak, or permitting the strong to infringe the laws
with im∣punity."</Q> When he arrived at his jagier, he actually put this
re∣solution in practice, by rendering justice to the poor, and reducing to
order such of his zemindars as opposed his authority. He, by this means,
had his revenues punctually paid, and his country well cultivated. His
reputation grew apace; for all his actions discovered uncommon genius and
resolution.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">who is pleas∣ed with his
behavior.</NOTE>Hassin coming to visit the pergunnahs, was extremely
pleased with the management of his son, and therefore continued him in his
office. But the father had a slave by whom he had three sons, So∣liman,
Ahmed, and Mudda, and the old man was extremely sond of her. She told him,
that now her son Soliman was grown up, <PB N="152" REF="160"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1542. Hig. 949.</NOTE>and that he ought to
provide for him. She, day after day, conti∣nued to teaze Hassin for the
superintendency of the pergunnahs for Soliman. This gave the old omrah great
concern, knowing the su∣perior abilities of Ferîd. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">He resigns the manage∣ment of the
jagier.</NOTE>The son, hearing that the domestic peace of his father was
destroyed, by the importunities of his favorite, made a voluntary
resignation of his trust, which was accordingly conferred upon Soliman.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Goes to Agra.</NOTE>Ferîd, and his
brother Nizam, set out immediately for Agra, and entered into the service
of Dowlat Chan, one of the principal om∣rahs of Sultan Ibrahim. Ferîd, by
his good behavior, soon insi∣nuated himself into his master's
affection. Dowlat desired him, one day, to tell him what he was most
desirous to obtain, and that he would use his interest with the sultan
in his favor. Ferîd replied, That his father was now in his dotage, and
wholly guided by an art∣ful mistress, who had deprived both himself and
his brother of their patrimonial inheritance, and had procured their jagier for
her own spurious offspring. That if Dowlat would, therefore, by his
interest at court, procure the jagier-sonnad in his name, he would
promise to provide for his father, and maintain five hundred good horse for
the service of the empire.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The emperor refuses to grant him his father's
ja∣gier,</NOTE>Dowlat Chan accordingly preferred this request to the
sultan, who replied, That he must be a bad man indeed, who reviled and
un∣dermined his own father. Dowlat Chan retired in silence, and ac∣quainted
him of the answer he had received, but comforted Ferîd, by telling him
that he would take another opportunity to urge his request. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">which, upon his father's death, he
ob∣tains.</NOTE>In the mean time, the father of Ferîd died, and Dowlat
Chan obtained the emperor's grant, with which the two brothers set out to
Sehsaram with a grand retinue.</P>
<P>Soliman, upon the arrival of his brothers, evacuating the country,
went off to Mahummud Chan Soor, who held the purgunnah of <PB N="153" REF="161"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1542. Hig. 949.</NOTE>Chond, and kept up a

Ferîd. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">His brother Soliman complains of him to
Ma∣hummud Soor;</NOTE>Mahummud Chan told him, that Baber, having invaded
Hindostan, a war between him and Sul∣tan Ibrahim was unavoidable. That,
therefore, if he should ac∣company him when called to the imperial army, he
would endea∣vor to get him redress. Soliman was too impatient to wait so
long in suspence. Mahummud Chan, therefore, sent a person to
Ferîd, to treat about a reconciliation. Ferîd replied, That he was
willing to give him a proper share of his father's inheritance, but that he
must be excused from parting with any of his power; repeating, at the
same time, the old adage, That two swords could never rest in one
scabbard.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">who forms designs a∣gainst
him.</NOTE>Soliman could not be satisfied with sharing the government, and
therefore nothing was settled between the brothers. This irritated Mahummud
Chan so much, that he resolved to compel him to the measures which he
himself had proposed. Ferîd being informed of this resolution,
began to provide for his own security; but news ar∣riving of Sultan Ibrahim's
death, the whole country was thrown into confusion. Ferîd resolved
not to lie idle in the midst of the troubles which ensued. He joined
Pâr Chan, the son of Diria Chan Loha∣ni, who had subdued Behar, and
assumed the royal dignity, under the name of Sultan Mahummud, or Mahmood.
As the sultan was one day on a hunting party, he roused an enormous tiger;
which Ferîd immediately attacked and killed with one blow of his fabre. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></NOTE>For this bold action, which was done in the sultan's
presence, he was honored with the title of Shere Chan<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Shere signifies a lion.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Shere Chan rose gradually to great influence and favor, in the
sul∣tan's service. He was even appointed tutor to the sultan's son,
Jellal Chan. He, in the mean time, requested permission to go to hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> jagier, but he was detained there by
business, till his leave of ab∣sence <PB N="154" REF="162"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1542. Hig. 949.</NOTE>expired. Sultan
Mahummud, dissatisfied with this behavior, reproached him, one day in
public, with breach of promise; 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">He is accused to Sultan Mahmood.</NOTE>and
Mahummud Chan, an omrah, being present, took that opportunity of accusing
him of treasonable designs, and with favoring the interest of Sultan
Mamood, the son of Sultan Secunder. The sultan was, by this means, so
incensed against him, that he intimated, at the same time, a design to
deprive him of his jagier, and to confer it upon his brother Soliman, as a
just punishment for his offence, and the only thing that could bring him to
a proper sense of his duty.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Proceedings against him.</NOTE>The sultan,
however, having a great esteem for Shere Chan, against whom nothing was yet
proved, laid aside the violent measure to which he was instigated by
Mahummud. He, at the same time, by way of alarming him, gave orders to his
accuser to enquire into his father's estate, and make an equal division
of it among all the bro∣thers. Mahummud Chan, glad of this order, sent one of
his servants to Shere Chan to acquaint him, that his brothers, according to
the sultan's commands, were to have their proportionable dividends of the
estate which he had hitherto so unjustly with-held from them.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The nature of tenures in
Hindostan.</NOTE>Shere Chan returned for answer, that Mahummud was very
much mistaken in this matter. That there were no heritable estates in
Hindostan, among Mahomedans, for that all lands belonged to the king, which
he disposed of at pleasure. That as he himself had a personal grant
of his jagier, his brethren were entirely out of the question. That he,
however, had already consented to give to his brother Soliman a part of the
money and moveables, according to law.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Shere Chan attacked.</NOTE>When the
messenger returned with this answer to Mahummud Chan, who was then at
Jiond, he was enraged at so flat a denial, and raising all his forces,
sent them against Shere Chan, under the command of Shadi, his adopted
slave, accompanied by Soliman and <PB N="155" REF="163"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1542. Hig. 949.</NOTE>Ahmed. His orders
were to take possession of the country, and to leave a force with
Soliman, to protect him in the jagier.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">who deter∣mines to op∣pose him.</NOTE>This
resolution being quickly taken, Shere Chan had not time to collect his
people; but, upon the first alarm, he wrote to Malleck Sook, his deputy in
the pergunnah of Chawasspoor Tandah, to harrass the enemy with what troops
he had, but to avoid an ac∣tion till he joined him in person. But Malleck
Sook, desirous to dis∣tinguish himself, gave them battle, and lost
his life and the victory.</P>
<P>This disaster weakened Shere Chan so much, that he was in no
condition to oppose Mahummud; 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">He flies to Kurrah.</NOTE>he therefore evacuated
the coun∣try, and fled to Juneid Birlass, suba of Kurrah and Maneckpoor, on
the part of Sultan Baber. He made the suba a handsome present, was taken
into favor, and obtained a body of troops to recover his country. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Returns and defeats Ma∣hummud.</NOTE>With
these he defeated Mahummud, who fled to the mountains of Rhotas, so that he
not only possessed himself of his own country, but added several
other pergunnahs to his jagier, which he now held of Sultan Baber. Having
rewarded the Moguls who had assisted him, he permitted them to return to
their master. He, at the same time, levied troops, and was joined by his
former friends, who had fled to the hills, which rendered him very formi∣dable
in those parts.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">His generosi∣ty to him.</NOTE>Shere Chan
having thus established himself in his jagier, per∣formed an act of
generosity, which, if it was not intended to de∣ceive the world, does him
much honor. He recalled Mahummud Chan, who had fled, and put him in
possession of his former jagier. This generous treatment converted his
greatest enemy into one of his best friends.</P>
<P>Shere having settled his affairs, left his brother Nizam in
charge of his country, and paid a visit to his benefactor Juneid Birlass,
at <PB N="156" REF="164"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1542. Hig. 949.</NOTE>Kurrah. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Goes to Agra.</NOTE>Birlass was then going to
Agra, and Shere resolved to ac∣company him thither. He was, upon this
occasion, introduced to Sultan Baber, and attended that prince in his
expedition to Chinderi.</P>
<P>After Shere had staid some time in the Mogul camp, and
observed their manners and policy, he, one day, told a friend, that he
thought it would be an easy matter to drive those foreigners out of
Hindostan. His friend asked him, what reason he had to think so? Shere
re∣plied, 
<Q REND="inline"><NOTE PLACE="marg">His opinion concerning the
Moguls.</NOTE>"That the king himself, though a man of great parts, was but
very little acquainted with the policy of Hindostan; and that the vizier, who
held the reins of government, would be too much biassed in favor of his own
interest, to mind that of the public. That therefore if the Patans, who were
now at enmity among themselves, could be brought to mutual concord, the work
was compleated; and should fortune ever favor him, he imagined him∣self
equal to the task, however difficult it might, at present, ap∣pear."</Q>
His friend burst out into a loud laugh, and began to ri∣dicule this vain
opinion.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">His behavior at the King's table</NOTE>Shere, a
few days after, had, at the king's table, some solid dishes set before
him, with only a spoon to eat them. He called for a knife, but the servants
had orders not to supply him with one. Shere, not to lose his dinner, drew
his dagger, without ceremony, and cutting up his meat, made a hearty meal,
without minding those who diverted themselves at this odd behavior. When he
had done, the king, who had been remarking his manner, turned to Amir
Chalisa,

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">He privately withdraws.</NOTE>Shere Chan
perceiving, by these words, that the king had been informed of his private

Shere Chan's protection. Sultan Mahmood, to revenge this insult, ordered
Cuttub Chan, governor of Mongier, with a great force, against Behar. As the
forces of Behar were in∣considerable, in comparison of those of Bengal,
Shere Chan made many overtures for accommodating differences, but to no effect.

<NOTE PLACE="marg">Overthrows the

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A plot against his life.</NOTE>After this

great influence of his minister. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">He offers to resign.</NOTE>He told, on this
occasion, to the young prince, that there was no necessity of taking

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mahmood of Bengal assists him with an
army,</NOTE>Sultan Mahmood, joining his compassion for the young prince, to
his personal hatred for Shere, sent Ibrahim Chan, the son of Cuttub Chan,
with a considerable army against the usurper. The Bengalians besieged
Shere in a mud fort, for a long time, without success; so that Ibrahim
was obliged to send home for succours. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">which is overthrown by Shere.</NOTE>Shere Chan,
being informed of this circumstance, came out, offered battle, and, by means
of a common stratagem, ordering his troops to fly at the first onset, to
draw the enemy into an ambush, defeated them, and took all their guns and
elephants. Ibrahim Chan was slain in the action, and the young prince fled in
great distress to Bengal.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">All Behar submits to him.</NOTE>Shere, by
this victory, became lord of all Behar, and grew daily more and more
formidable. Taje Chan was, at this time, governor of the strong fort of
Chinâr, which he had held for himself ever since the death of Sultan
Ibrahim Lodi. His wife Lade Mallecke, who was barren, yet for whom he had a
very great affection, being envied by his other wives, by whom he had children,
they instigated their sons to make away with her. But one of the sons,
who had under∣taken the murder, missed his blow, and only inflicted a
slight wound. Taje Chan, alarmed by her cries, came to her assistance,
and drew his sword to kill his son. The son, seeing no means to
escape, as∣saulted his father, and slew him. The sons of Taje Chan
were yet <PB N="159" REF="167"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1542. Hig. 949.</NOTE>too young to be
entrusted with the government, and Lade Mallecke drew the reins into her own
hands, by her address among the chiefs and zemindars. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Shere Chan, by marriage, obtains the
possession of Chinâr.</NOTE>Shere Chan, informed of these
transactions, set a treaty of marriage on foot with Lade Mallecke, which
was soon concluded. Shere seized upon Chinâr and the dependant
districts, which was a great acquisition to his power, there being a
consider∣able treasure in the place.</P>
<P>Much about this time, Sultan Mahmood, the son of Sultan
Se∣cunder Lodi, having taken protection with Rana Sinka, by his
as∣sistance, and that of Hassen Chan Mewati, advanced against
Sultan Baber, and were defeated, as we have already seen, at Janveh. Sultan
Mahmood, flying to Chitor, was from thence invited by the omrahs of Lodi, who
were gathered together at Patna, and by them proclaimed king. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sultan Mah∣mond Lodi possesses
him∣self of Behar.</NOTE>He made himself soon master of all Behar.
Shere Chan perceiving that he could not draw the omrahs over from the
sultan's interest, and that he had not sufficient force to oppose him,
submitted to his authority, and, by that means, saved a part of Behar,
which the sultan permitted him to retain. The sultan told him, at the
same time, that if he should effectually assist him in recovering
Jionpoor from the Moguls, he would return Behar to him; and a contract to that
effect was drawn up and executed between them.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Shere Chan obtains leave to visit his
jagier.</NOTE>Shere Chan, some time after, obtained leave to return to
Shessaram, to levy troops, and Sultan Mahmood marching, with an army,
against the Moguls, sent him orders to join. But as Shere delayed for
some time, the sultan, persuaded by his omrahs that he was playing a
loose game, marched his army through his jagier on his way to Jionpoor. Shere
came out to meet him, had an elegant en∣tertainment provided for his reception,
and then marched with him to Jionpoor. The troops of Humaioon evacuated the
province upon their approach, so that the Afghans took possession of
the country as far as Lucknore.</P>

having, on this occasion, given a superior command to Bein Baezîd,
Shere Chan, who thought himself ill-used, betrayed his master, and wrote
a private letter, the night before the action, to Hindoo Beg, one of the Mogul
generals, acquainting him, 
<Q REND="inline">"That he esteemed himself a servant of
Baber's family, to whom he owed his advancement, and that he would be the
cause of defeating the Afghans next day."</Q> He drew off his troops in the
action, which occasioned Mahmood's defeat, for which service he was greatly
fa∣vored by Humaioon. Sultan Mahmood, after this defeat, retreated to Patna,
retired from the world, and, in the year nine hundred and forty nine, died in
Orissa.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Refuses to give up Chinâr to

he was willing to pay him the proper revenues of the lands which he held, and

consented to these terms, and, ac∣cordingly, being joined by Cuttub Chan
and Isey Chan Hajbil, with five hundred horse, he marched towards Sultan
Bahadur. The king, <PB N="161" REF="169"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1542. Hig. 949.</NOTE>however, had
scarcely reached Guzerat, when Cuttub Chan deserted with his horse, and

<NOTE PLACE="marg">Shere re∣duces Behar, and enters

Behar. Not satisfied with this success, he pursued his fortune, and
penetrated into the heart of Bengal, having fought with the omrahs of that
country several sharp battles, before he could make himself master of
the passes, which were defended a whole month.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Besieges Sul∣tan Mah∣mood Lodi, in
Gour.</NOTE>Sultan Mahmood of Bengal shut himself up in Gour, which Shere
Chan for a long time besieged. One of the zemindars of Behar hav∣ing raised
a disturbance, he left Chawass Chan to carry on the siege, and returned
himself to Behar. Provisions becoming at length very scarce in Gour,
Sultan Mahmood fled in a boat to Hadjepoor; and Shere Chan, having settled
affairs in Behar, returned and pursued him. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Overthrows Mahmood.</NOTE>Mahmood being
necessitated to give battle, was defeated, and being wounded in the
engagement, fled his kingdom, which imme∣diately fell into the hands of the
conqueror.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Humaioon turns his arms against
him.</NOTE>Humaioon, returning from his expedition to Guzerat, thought it
necessary to put a stop to the rising power of Shere Chan. He for that
purpose turned towards the reduction of Chinâr. Jellal Chan, who
commanded there, left the defence of the place to Ghazi Soor, and retired to
the hills of Bercundah, from whence he very much annoyed the besiegers. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Takes Chi∣nâr.</NOTE>The siege had been
carried on six months, when Rumi Chan, who commanded the king's artillery, by
some kind of a floating battery, which he sent down the river close to
the wall, reduced the place.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Marches to∣ward Ben∣gal,</NOTE>Humaioon left
two hundred soldiers in garrison there, and marched towards Bengal. Sultan
Mahmood, who, as we have already ob∣served, was wounded in the action with
Shere Chan, threw himself under the protection of Humaioon. When the king had
advanced to Gurhi, which is the frontier of Bengal, he found that Shere Chan
had <PB N="162" REF="170"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1542. Hig. 949.</NOTE>sent Jellal Chan,
Chawass Chan, and a good detachment, to guard that pass. The king sent
Jehangire Kulli Beg, and some other omrahs, to dislodge them; but they were
repulsed in several attacks. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">forces the passes.</NOTE>Being, however,
supported by more troops, and the whole army appearing in sight, a
successful assault was made, and the Moguls became mas∣ters of the
pass. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Drives Shere Chan to the mountains of
Jarchund.</NOTE>Jellal Chan fled to his father Shere Chan at Gour, who, being
in no condition to engage so superior a force, evacuated that capital,
carried off all his wealth to the mountains of Jarcund, and begun to project a
scheme for possessing himself of Rhotas, that he might there lodge
his family and wealth in security.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Shere Chan, by a strata∣gem, takes the
im∣pregnable fortress of Rhotas.</NOTE>To take Rhotas by open force was an
impossible attempt. It was therefore necessary to devise some
stratagem, by which success might be hoped. Shere, for this purpose,
sent a message to Raja Berkiss, who was in possession of this
impregnable fortress, and told him, 
<Q REND="inline">"That as he himself was going to attempt the
recovery of Bengal, he hoped, from their former friendship, that he would
permit him to send his family and treasure into the place, with a few
attendants."</Q> The raja at first rejected this request, but Shere Chan
sent an artful embassador to the raja, a second time, with some
handsome presents, acquainting him, 
<Q REND="inline">"That it was only for his women and treasure he
requested the raja's protection: That should he be fortunate enough to
conquer Bengal, he would make proper acknowledgments for the favor on his
return; but if he should lose his life in the contest, he rather chose
that his family and wealth should fall into his hands, than into those of
the Moguls, his inveterate enemies."</Q></P>
<P>The raja, permitting himself to be deluded by his avarice,
deter∣mined, when once in possession of the treasure, to keep it, and
therefore consented to Shere's request. Shere Chan having pro∣vided covered
doolies<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The same with sedan chairs.</NOTE>, filled
them all, except two or three, which were to go first, with armed men and
arms. He, at the <PB N="163" REF="171"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1542. Hig. 949.</NOTE>same time, filled
five hundred money bags with ball, and appointed some of his best
soldiers to carry them, in the disguise of slaves, with sticks in
their hands, to help the treasure up the mountain. The men, who carried the
doolies, were disguised in the same man∣ner. This train accordingly set
out, and the first and second dooly being examined at the gate, were found
to contain only old women, so further examination was neglected. The raja
was, in the mean time, busy in counting the bags, which he now reckoned part
of his own fortune. When the doolies had reached the house which the raja had
appointed, the wolves rushed out among the sheep, and begun to dye the fold
with their blood. The porters used their staves, till they supplied
themselves with arms from the doolies. They easily mastered the
garrison, who were off their guard, and admitted Shere Chan, who was encamped
at a small distance. The raja himself, with a few followers, found means
to escape into the woods, by a private passage behind the fort.</P>
<P>Thus fell one of the most impregnable fortresses in the
world into the hands of Shere Chan, together with much treasure, which had
been accumulating there for ages. The merit of the invention of this
stratagem is not due to Shere. The fort of Asere, in the De∣can, was, long
before, taken in the same manner by Nasir Chan Faroki, governor of
Chandez.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Description of Rhotas.</NOTE>Rhotas is built
upon the level top of a mountain; the only en∣trance to it is a very narrow
road, through a steep ascent of one crore, from the foot of the hill to the
gates, which are three in number, one above another, defended by guns and
rolling-stones. The square contents of the fortified table land, on the top
of the mountain, is more than five crores. In this space are contained towns,
villages, and corn fields, and water is found a few feet from the surface. On
one side runs the river Sone, under an immense precipice, and another
river, in the same manner, passes close to the <PB N="164" REF="172"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1541. Hig. 948.</NOTE>other side, and
both meeting a little below, form the hill into a tri∣angular peninsula.
There is a very deep valley on the third side, full of impervious woods,
which spread all over the mountains, and render all access that way next to
impossible.</P>
<P>Shere Chan had now a secure retreat for his family, and his
friends began to acquire fresh spirits by this piece of success.
Hu∣maioon, in the mean time, spent three months in luxurious plea∣sures, at
Gour, or Lucknouti. He there received advices that Mirza Hindal, his brother,
had revolted in Agra and Mewat; that he had put Shech Phoul to death, and
coined money in his own name. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Humaioon marches back towards Agra.</NOTE>He
therefore left Jehangire Kulli Beg, with five thousand horse, in Gour, and
returned towards Agra.</P>
<P>By the excessive rains and bad roads, the king's cavalry and

want of forage.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Shere Shaw
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>.</NOTE>SHERE SHAW, immediately
after the reduction of Bengal, assumed the imperial title, struck the
coin, and read the chutba, in his own name. He marched, the next year, with a
great army, to∣wards Agra. The unfortunate Humaioon was, by this time,
deserted <PB N="165" REF="173"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A D. 1542. Hig. 949.</NOTE>by his brother Mirza
Camiran, and hated by his Mogul omrahs, on account of his attention to his
Turkuman mercenaries. He, how∣ever, crossed the river with one hundred
thousand horse, and met Shere Chan, who had but fifty thousand. Shere, as
we have already men∣tioned, defeated Humaioon, and pursued him to Agra,
Lahore, and Choshâb; from which place the king retreated towards
Sind.</P>
<P>Ismaiel Chan, Ghazi Chan, Fatti Chan, and Billoche Dudai, all
omrahs of that country, joined Shere Shaw. The sultan, observ∣ing a hill,
among the mountains of Balnat, proper for a fortress, or∣dered one to be
built, which he named Rhotas. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Makes Cha∣was Chan captain
gene∣ral.</NOTE>Chawass Chan, his faithful slave, to whose bravery and
conduct he owned himself greatly indebted for his fortune, was now made Amir
ul Omrah, with a pension of a tenth of the royal revenue.</P>
<P>Having left the Amir ul Omrah, and Hybut Chan Neazi, with a great
army, in the north west, Shere Shaw returned towards Agra. He was in that
city informed, that Chizer Chan Sirik, whom he left suba of Bengal, had
married the daughter of Mahmood, the for∣mer sultan of that province, and
held the state of a sovereign prince. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reduces the
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Ben∣gal.</NOTE>Having
experienced, in his own fortune, the danger of permitting such behavior to go
unpunished, he marched immediately to Bengal. Chizer Chan being unexpectedly
surprized, submitted without trouble, and was imprisoned. Shere Shaw very
prudently divided the kingdom of Bengal among a number of omrahs, independent
of one another, and appointed Kasi Fazilit, a native of Kurrah, famous for
his learn∣ing and policy, to superintend the whole. He himself, after
these transactions, retired to Agra.</P>
<P>In the year nine hundred and forty nine, Shere made a motion
to∣wards Malava. Having advanced as far as Gualier, Suja Chan Af∣ghan, who had
before inverted the place, on the part of Shere Shaw, found means to settle

entered Malava, Mullu Chan, governor of that province, submitted without a
blow. Being, however, a few days after, alarmed by something, he fled from
the king's camp, and Hadjee Chan was appointed to that government; Suja Chan
had also a jagier conferred upon him in that country. Shere Shaw having
marched from thence to Rintimpore, Mullee Chan fell upon the go∣vernor of
Malava, and upon Suja Chan, but he was defeated. Suja Chan having acquired all
the honor of the victory, Hadjee Chan was superseded and recalled, and the
government conferred upon Suja.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Takes Rin∣timpore.</NOTE>Shere Shaw arriving
before Rintimpore, had the address to get possession of that
important fortress, from the governor, on the part of Sultan Mahmood Lodi,
who had still kept it. The emperor, after taking Rintimpore, returned to
Agra. He remained in that city a whole year, settling the internal police of
the empire, and regulating his army. He, in the mean time, ordered Hybut Chan
to wrest Moultan from the Bellochies. This Hybut soon effected by defeating
Fatti Chan Bellochi, and entirely subduing that country. He had, on ac∣count
of this exploit, the title of Azim Humaioon conferred upon him.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">He marches against Raja Paran, for keeping
two thousand concubines.</NOTE>In the year nine hundred and fifty, Paran
Mull, the son of Raja Suckdeo Parbia, having conquered some neighbouring
pergunnahs, kept no less than two thousand concubines and dancing girls in
his zinnana. The king, resenting this indignity, marched and invested him
in the sort of Raisein. The siege being protracted for a long time, Paran
Mull began to treat of a capitulation. This was granted to him upon the
honorable terms of marching out, with all his arms, treasure, family,
garrison, and effects. Paran accordingly marched out with four thousand
rajaputs, and, trusting to the faith which had been pledged, encamped at a
small distance.</P>
<P> <PB N="167" REF="175"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1543. Hig. 950.</NOTE><NOTE PLACE="marg">His treachery and cruelty.</NOTE>But Shere Shaw, who never kept
the faith of treaties, was easily persuaded, by his base ministers,
particularly by Amir Ruffi ul Dien Suffvi, infamously to violate his honor.
He surrounded the rajaputs, and ordered them all to be massacred. He,
however, paid very dear for this horrid piece of cruelty and treachery The
rajaputs, placing death in one eye and revenge in the other, sought till
every man of them was laid dead on the plain, and above double their number of
the assassins.</P>
<P>Shere Shaw, after this infamous transaction, returned to Agra. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">He marches towards Mar∣wâr,</NOTE>Having
remained there a few months, to refresh and recruit his army, he marched
towards Marwâr. During his march he intrenched him∣self every night, as
well for security, as to exercise his troops, and make them expert in this
necessary service. When he came to cross the sands, he formed
redoubts all round him with gabions. In this manner he entered the country of
the raja of Nagor and Todpoor, whose name was Maldeo, and esteemed the
most powerful raja in Hindostan. He opposed the king, with fifty
thousand rajaputs, and both armies lay thirty days in sight of one
another.</P>
<P>Shere Shaw would now have been glad to retreat quietly. But the
dan∣ger was too great, at the same time the enemy was so advantageously
posted as to render an attack too hazardous. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">and,
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>.</NOTE>In the midst of this
alarm∣ing situation, a successful stratagem suggested itself to
the king. Raja Maldeo having conquered that country, to which he had no right
by inheritance, Shere Shaw forged a letter, in the Hindoo language and
character, in the name of the raja's generals, addressed to himself,
setting forth, 
<Q REND="inline">"That, being conquered by the raja, they had,
through necessity, served him till then with fidelity; but that they
were, in secret, very weary of his yoke. That if he would therefore,
reinstate them in their former possessions, they were willing to make

super∣scribed, as usual, in Persian, That they should fear nothing,

<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1544. Hig. 951.</NOTE>them to persevere
in their intentions, and that they might rest assured, that he would
comply with their demand.</P>
<P>This letter was purposely thrown into the way of the raja, who,
being always in dread of his omrahs, was easily deceived. He there∣fore
declined the battle, which he intended to give that day. He was even more and
more confirmed in his unjust suspicion, by the eagerness which they
expressed to engage. Upon the fourth day he ordered a retreat; 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gallant pro∣posal of Ra∣japut omrah.</NOTE>but
Cunia, one of his principal omrahs, having found out in what manner the raja
had been deceived by these forge∣ries, endeavoured to persuade him of his
mistake. Having found that the raja's suspicions could not be removed, he
told him, That the suspected treachery was unprecedented among true
Rajaputs, and that he was determined to wipe off the stain which the raja had
thrown upon their reputation, by his own blood, or the conquest of Shere
Shaw, with his own tribe.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">He returns with his own tribe, and at∣tacks
Shere.</NOTE>The raja continued to retreat, but the gallant Cunia, with a few
other chiefs, and ten or twelve thousand men, turned back, with an intent to
surprize Shere Shaw's camp. They, however, by some mistake, lost their
way, and it was fair day light before they saw the enemy. Shere Shaw
immediately formed, and came out against them. Though the king's army, by the
smallest computation, consisted of eighty thousand fighting men, this
handful of brave Rajaputs repulsed them repeatedly, and would have certainly
defeated them, if Jellal Chan Selwani had not at that instant arrived with a
fresh reinforce∣ment, to join the imperial army. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">After an ob∣stinate battle, the rajaputs are

prepared himself for hostilities. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">besieges the place.</NOTE>Shere Shaw, having
drawn a line of circumvallation, begun to carry on his ap∣proaches to the

the rock. The royal batteries were now ad∣vanced very near the walls, breaches
were made, and a general assault ordered, when a live shell, which had
been thrown against the fort by the imperialists, rebounded back into the
battery in which the king stood. The shell burst in the midst of a
quantity of powder, which had not been properly secured. Several gunners were
blown up; 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The king burnt by the blowing up of

orders, till in the evening news was brought him of the reduction of the place.

sat upon the musnud five years, as em∣peror of Hindostan.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">His charac∣ter.</NOTE>The character of Shere
Shaw is almost equally divided between virtue and vice. Public justice
prevailed in the kingdom, while private acts of treachery dishonored the
hands of the king. He seemed to have made breach of faith a royal property,
which he would by no means permit his subjects to share with him. We ought,
perhaps, to ascribe this vice to the ambition of Shere. Had he been born to
the musnud, he might have been just, as he was valiant and politic in war:
Had he confined his mind to his jagier, he might merit the character of a
virtuous omrah; but his great soul made him look up to the throne, and he
cared not by what steps he was to ascend.</P>

monuments of his magnificence behind him. From Bengal and Sennargaum, to the
Sind, or Nilab, which is fifteen hundred crores<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">About

stage, and dug a well at the end of every crore. Besides, he raised many
magnificent mosques for the worship of God on the highway, wherein he
appointed readers of the Koran and Imams. He or∣dered that at every serai,
all travellers, without distinction of country or religion, should be
entertained, according to their quality, at the public expence. He, at the
same time, planted rows of fruit trees along the roads, to preserve
travellers from the scorching heat of the sun, as well as to gratify their
taste.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Was the first who establish∣ed regular
horse posts.</NOTE>Horse-posts were placed at proper distances, for

<HEAD>SECTION IV. The reign of SELIM SHAW, the Son of SHERE
SHAW.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN Shere Shaw was numbered with the dead, his eldest son,
Adil Chan, whom he appointed his successor, was at Rintimpore, and his
younger son, Jellal, in the village of Rewin, near Phetah. The omrahs, who
favored Jellal more than his brother, then at so great a distance,
prevended the necessity of filling the throne as soon as possible.
They, for that purpose, dispatched expresses to Jellal Chan, who
arrived in five days in the camp. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jellal Chan mounts the throne by the
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of Se∣lim Shaw.</NOTE>Jellal,
by the in∣fluence of Isah Chan Hugab, and his party, mounted the throne, in
the fortress of Callinger, upon the seventeenth of Ribbi ul Awil, in the
year nine hundred and fifty two, and assumed the title of Islam Shaw,
which, by false pronunciation, was turned to that of Selim Shaw, by which
name he is more generally known.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">He writes to his brother.</NOTE>Selim Shaw,
having taken upon him the imperial dignity, wrote to his elder brother, in the
following words: 
<Q REND="inline">"Adil being at so great a distance, and I so
near, to prevent disturbance, I took upon me <PB N="172" REF="180"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1545. Hig. 952.</NOTE>the command of the
army till his return. But my intentions are only to forward my brother's
interest, and to support his authority."</Q></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">He is placed a second time upon the
musnud.</NOTE>Jellal, after writing this letter, marched from Callinger
towards Agra, and at Kurrah was met by Chawass Chan, who renewed the
ceremonies of royalty, and placed Selim Shaw a second time on the throne,
holding a magnificent festival upon that occasion. From Kurrah, Selim Shaw
wrote another letter to his brother, begging in the most affectionate terms,
that he would come and see him.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">His brother's answer.</NOTE>Adil Chan wrote
to the omrahs of Selim Shaw, particularly to Cuttub Chan Naib, Isah Chan
Neazi, Chawass Chan, and Jellal Chan Selwani, to know to what purpose he
was invited, and what he was to hope from them. He, at the same time,
returned to his brother for answer, 
<Q REND="inline">"That, if he would send these four omrahs to
him, with proper assurances, he would come."</Q> Selim Shaw sent
accordingly the four omrahs to Adil Shaw, to assure him, in the most
solemn manner, that he would permit him, if he pleased, to depart after the
first in∣terview: But that, as the omrahs had invested him with the
imperial power, he could not be so ungrateful as to desert them. However,
to make some compensation to Adil, for the empire, he was deter∣mined to
give him his choice of any of the provinces in free jagier.</P>
<P>Adil Shaw, upon these assurances, proceeded to Agra. When he
had reached the village of Sikri<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Now Fattepoor.</NOTE>,
Selim Shaw was out on a hunting party, near that place, and appointed carpets
to be spread for their interview. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The inter∣view of the brothers.</NOTE>Here the
brothers dissembled the greatest af∣fection for one another, and after
some discourse set out for Agra. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their designs against one
another.</NOTE>Selim Shaw, who wanted to seize his brother, gave private
orders, that only a few of his retinue should be admitted into the citadel;
but Adil Shaw had also given orders to his people to press in, at all
hazards, which they accordingly did, in spite of all opposition.</P>
<P> <PB N="173" REF="181"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1545. Hig. 952.</NOTE><NOTE PLACE="marg">Transactions in the palace.</NOTE>Selim Shaw saw, that,
without running a great risque, nothing could be effected against his
brother, who was so much upon his guard. He, therefore, had recourse to
flattery and dissimulation. He even proceeded so far, as to lay hold of
Adil's hand, to place him upon the throne. Adil Shaw, who was naturally a
timorous and indolent man, rejected this proposal, knowing how little he had
to trust from the omrahs, and a deceitful, ambitious brother. Selim Shaw was
well aware of all this, before he made this extraordinary offer.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Adil makes a solemn resig∣nation of the
empire.</NOTE>Just as Selim expected, so it fell out; Adil Shaw,
intimidated by the disturbance which had been made at the gate, made a
voluntary resignation of his birthright, and placing Selim Shaw on the
throne, saluted him emperor. This was instantly followed by all the court,
who were waiting with impatience the issue of this extraordinary farce.
They immediately advanced to the throne in succession, and, according to
their rank, presented their nazirs<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Offerings made
upon public occasions to the emperor.</NOTE>, while others ex∣hibited the
ceremony of the isar<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Isar, or Tessiduck,

delivered over to the royal almoner, to be distributed in charity, as indeed
are all offerings made to the emperor.</NOTE>, crying out aloud, 
<Q REND="inline">"We offer our lives and fortunes to the
king."</Q></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Adil obtains the province of Biana in
jagier.</NOTE>The ceremonies being ended, Cuttub Chan, and the other omrahs,
who had passed their words to Adil Shaw, requested, that, as he had
pitched upon Biana for his jagier, he, according to promise, should be
regularly invested with that province, and permitted to depart. Selim Shaw
consented, and all matters being settled, he gave Adil leave to quit Agra,
accompanied by Isah Chan and Chawass Chan.</P>
<P> <PB N="174" REF="182"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1545. Hig. 952.</NOTE>But after two
months, Selim gave to Ghazi Mahli, one of his eunuchs, a pair of golden
fetters, to go and bring Adil Shaw prisoner. Adil Shaw, having timeous
intelligence of this design against him, set out for Mewat, where
Chawass Chan then resided. He acquainted that omrah, with tears, of his
brother's baseness. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chawass Chan kindles a rebellion in favor of
Adil.</NOTE>Chawass Chan, whose honor was concerned in this affair, was
rouzed with com∣passion for the unfortunate prince. He seized upon Ghazi
Mahli, placed his fetters upon his own legs, and exalted the spear of
rebel∣lion against Selim Shaw.</P>
<P>The interest of Chawass was great among the omrahs. He wrote
to them private letters, and brought many over to his party. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">He marches towards Agra.</NOTE>A great army was
soon raised, and Chawass, with Adil Shaw and Isah Chan, marched towards
Agra. He, upon his way, received letters from Cuttub Chan and Jellal Chan, who
thought themselves dis∣honored by the king's behavior, assuring him of
their assistance.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Selim in great perplexity.</NOTE>When the
confederate omrahs arrived before Agra, Selim Shaw, at this unexpected visit,
was thrown into the utmost perplexity. He called Cuttub Chan and Jellal Chan
to his presence, and reproached them for not dissuading him from that
impolitic step which had drawn upon him such dangerous consequences.
Cuttub Chan re∣plied, 
<Q REND="inline">"That the business was not yet irremediable;
that he would undertake to settle every thing in an amicable manner."</Q>
Selim Shaw not suspecting the fidelity of the two omrahs, immediately
desired that they should go to Adil Shaw, and compromise affairs.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Proposes to fly to Chinar.</NOTE>When they
were gone, Selim Shaw discovered to his friends his intentions of flying to
Chinâr, where the treasure was lodged, and there to raise an army to
reduce his brother, whom he was not at present in a condition to oppose. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Is dissuaded by Isah Chan, and resolve,
to stand his ground.</NOTE>Isah Chan Hujâb dissuaded him from
this resolution. He told him, 
<Q REND="inline">"That he had with him ten thousand Chermalli
Patans, who had served him before he ascended <PB N="175" REF="183"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1545. Hig. 952.</NOTE>the throne, whom
he could not suspect of disaffection, besides many other faithful
servants. That therefore, it was the heighth of folly, to trust the empire,
which God had given him, to the future ca∣price of fortune, when he had it in
his power to defend it instantly in the field. Do not, said Isah, throw
away the friends whom you have acquired in your prosperity, with a vain hope
to pick up others in the season of distress. The wisest course
for you, continued the omrah, is to appear at the head of your troops, and to
fix the foot of resolution on the field of war. This will secure your
wavering troops, and intimidate the enemy."</Q></P>
<P>Selim Shaw, encouraged by this bold advice, resolved to stand
his ground. He immediately dispatched a message to Cuttub Chan, and the
other omrahs, who had not yet set out, to accommodate matters with Adil, and
commanded them to his presence. He told them, That having altered his mind,
he was resolved not to trust his faithful omrahs in the hands of his
enemies. He forthwith ordered his troops to their arms, marched out of the
city, and formed his army on the plain.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Engages the enemy, and over∣throws
them.</NOTE>The omrahs, who had promised to favor Adil Shaw, seeing their
king in the field, ashamed to betray him, were necessitated to fight,
which greatly disconcerted Chawass Chan, who, every minute, ex∣pected they
would join him. He, however, sought with great bra∣very, but he was
overthrown.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Adil Shaw disappears.</NOTE>Adil Shaw, after
this unfortunate battle, fled towards Patna, but he soon disappeared, and
was never heard of afterwards. Chawass Chan and Isah Chan Neazi, fled to
M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wât. Selim Shaw sent an
army in pursuit of those omrahs, but they came off victorious, at
Firospoor. The imperial army being soon after reinforced, the rebel chiefs
were obliged to retreat among the mountains of C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>maoon. Selim sent Cuttub Chan in pursuit of them, and
he plundered all <PB N="176" REF="184"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1545. Hig. 952.</NOTE>the countries lying
about the skirts of the hills, without effecting any thing against
them.</P>
<P>Selim Shaw, after these transactions, marched to Chinâr.
On the way, he was informed of the treasonable correspondence of Jellal
Chan with Adil, before the late decisive battle, and ordered him to be put to
death, together with his brother, who was concerned in the conspiracy. The
king having arrived at Chinâr, he took out of that fortress all the
treasure, sent it to Gualier, and returned himself to Agra.</P>
<P>Cuttub Chan, finding that Selim was no stranger to the part
which he had acted in the late disturbances, was afraid to return to court.
He fled, therefore, to Hybut Chan at Lahore, known by the title of Azim
Humaioon, and claimed his protection. Selim Shaw sent or∣ders to Lahore, that
Cuttub should be sent to Agra, with which Azim Humaioon complied. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Several sus∣pected per∣sons
punish∣ed.</NOTE>The unfortunate Cuttub, upon his ar∣rival, was sent
prisoner to Gualier, with many other suspected per∣sons, particularly
Shebaz Chan Lohani, the king's brother-in-law, whose eyes were put out. Azim
Humaioon and Suja Chan, suba of Malava, were, much about this time, called to
court. The first excused himself, and the latter, obeying the summons,
had the ad∣dress to clear himself of what he was accused, and so was
reinstated in his government.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The king marches to Rhotas.</NOTE>The king,
after these transactions, moved towards Rhotas, to bring the treasure,
which his father had deposited in that place, to Agra. Seid Chan, the brother
of Azim Humaioon, deserted him on the way, and fled to Lahore. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A rebellion.</NOTE>The king, from this
circumstance, concluded that a rebellion was in agitation, which determined
him to return immediately to Agra. He soon assembled his forces from all
quarters, and marched to Delhi, where he ordered the new city which Humaioon
had built, to be walled in with stone. At Delhi, <PB N="177" REF="185"/>

Chawass Chan, and other disaffected chiefs, with double the king's forces,
came out before Selim at Ambatta. Selim arriving within sight of the rebels,
dismounted, and, with a few friends, ascended a rising ground for the
purpose of reconnoitring; when he had for some time viewed their
disposition, he said: 
<Q REND="inline">"It is not consistent with my honor to have
any patience with a rebel∣lious army;"</Q> and, at these words, he ordered
his line to be formed, and to advance against them.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></NOTE>It happened very fortunately for the affairs of Selim, that,
upon the preceding night, there had arisen a dispute among the rebel
gene∣rals, about the succession to the throne. Chawass Chan
insisted that search should be made for Adil Shaw, and Azim Humaioon
strenu∣ously affirmed, 
<Q REND="inline">"That the empire was no man's inheritance, but
should always follow the fortune of the sword."</Q> This plainly point∣ed
out his own views. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></NOTE>On this head, animosity and faction arose, so that as
soon as the rebels had formed the line, Chawass Chan re∣treated, with all

discouraged the remaining part of the rebels, that their resistance was
faint, and an unexpected victory fell to Selim.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></NOTE>But, in the midst of this tide of good fortune, the

<HEAD>SECTION VIII. The transactions of HUMAIOON, from his arrival
in Persia, to his return to Hindostan.</HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1544. Hig. 951.</NOTE><NOTE PLACE="marg">Humaioon arrives in Persia.</NOTE>WE have already seen that
Humaioon, having arrived at Kizvi in Iran, dispatched Byram Chan to the
Persian monarch at Ispahan. That omrah accordingly waited upon Shaw
Tamasp at Nilack Kidar, between Abher and Sultania, and received an answer
which testified the king's great desire to have an interview with Humaioon,
The unfortunate sultan accepted, with joy, of the invitation, and in the
month of Jemmad ul Awil, in the year nine hundred and fifty one, had a
conference with Shaw Tamasp, the son of Shaw Ismaiel Suffvi, and was
royally entertained.</P>
<P>The king of Iran, one day, in conversation, asked Humaioon, By
what means his weak enemy became so powerful? Humaioon re∣plied, 
<Q REND="inline">"By the enmity of my brothers."</Q> The Persian
then told him, 
<Q REND="inline">"The political manner of treating brothers is not
such as they re∣ceived from you."</Q> And being, at that time, at table, as
soon as Shaw Tamasp was done eating, Byram Mirza, his brother, who attended
him, as a servant, came with the bason and ewer for him to wash<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">To attend the sovereign in any menial office about his
person, is the greatest honor that can be conferred upon a subject in the
East.</NOTE>. When this was done, Tamasp turned to Humaioon, and resuming
the discourse, said, 
<Q REND="inline">"In this manner you ought to have treated your
brothers."</Q> Humaioon, out of compliment to the king, seemed to assent
to what he said; which so much offended Byram Mirza, the king's brother,
that he never after could forgive him, while he re∣sided at court. He took
every opportunity to calumniate Humaioon to the king, and was ever harping in
his ears, how much against the interest of Persia it was, that a prince
of the line of Timur should sit <PB N="191" REF="199"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1544. Hig. 951.</NOTE>upon the throne of
Hindostan. This maxim Byram Mirza took care to inculcate upon all who had the
king's confidence. This circum∣stance greatly retarded the affairs of
Humaioon, and, at length, wrought so visibly upon the king's
disposition, that the unfortunate fugitive began to fear death or
imprisonment.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The king's sister and some omrahs favor
the cause of Humaioon.</NOTE>In the mean time, Sultanum Begum, the king's
sister, and Cusi Jehan of Kizvi, the high chancellor, in conjunction with
Hakîm Noor ul Dien, one of the king's privy counsellors, taking
compassion upon Humaioon's distressed situation, joined their
interests to work a reconciliation, and to reinstate him in the favor of
the king. The wit of Sultanum Begum had a great effect upon this occasion.
She, one day, produced a stanza of verses to the king, of her own
composition, in the name of Humaioon, extolling his devotion and happy turn
of expression in the praise of Ali. This greatly pleased Tamasp,
zealous for the sect of the Shiahs, who differ from the Sinnites, the sect
whose tenets Humaioon followed. The Shiahs hold Ali to be the only
assistant of Mahommed in his apostolic function, but the Sinnites
believe in four, adding Osman, Omar, and Abubecker to Ali.</P>
<P>The king, in short, told his sister, That if Humaioon
should be∣come a Shiah, and enforce that doctrine in Hindostan, he would
assist him to recover his empire. Sultanum Begum having acquainted
Humaioon of these particulars, he was not so much wedded to a sect, as to
lose a kingdom for an immaterial difference in a point of religion. He
accordingly returned for answer, 
<Q REND="inline">"That he had always privately favored the opinions
of the Shiahs, which was partly the occasion of the animosity
subsisting between him and his brothers."</Q></P>
<P>Shaw Tamasp, soon after, had a private conference with Byram
Chan, examined him concerning the policy and state of Hindostan; and when
he had satisfied himself upon that head, he promised that his son
Murad, who was then but an infant, with his general Biddai

should accompany Humaioon, with ten thousand horse, to chastise his
brothers, and drive them out of Cabul, Candahar, and Buduchshan. Every thing
accordingly was, in a short time, got in readiness, and Humaioon took leave
of the Persian king. He told him, that he had long proposed to take a tour
through Tibrez and Ardebiel, to visit the tomb of Shech Suffi, and then to
proceed on his expedition. The king consented to this proposal, and
issued or∣ders to all governors through whose territories Humaioon was to
pass, to supply him and his army with all necessaries, and treat him in
a manner becoming his dignity.</P>
<P>Humaioon having visited and paid his devotions at the shrine
of Suffi, marched with the young prince Murad, towards Candahar. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Humaioon takes Gar∣rimsere.</NOTE>He
invested the fort of Garrimsere, took it, and read the chutba in his own
name. Mirza Ashkari, who commanded at Candahar for Camiran, hearing of
these proceedings, sent the young prince, the son of Humaioon, Mahummud
Akbar, to his uncle at Cabul, and prepared the fort of Candahar for a
siege.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Humaioon invests Can∣dahar.</NOTE>Humaioon
invested it upon the seventh of Mohirrim, in the year nine hundred and
fifty two. The siege had been carried on for six months, when Humaioon
sent Byrâm Chan with a message to Mirza Cami∣ran, then at Cabul. A
tribe of the Patans of Hazara, attacked By∣râm with great resolution,
but they were defeated, and that omrah having obtained an audience of Mirza
Camiran, according to his in∣structions made a demand of Candahar, and
required a resignation of all those provinces which he had usurped from
his brother Hu∣maioon. But it was not to be expected that Mirza Camiran would
as yet listen to such a demand, and so the ambassador departed
with∣out effecting any thing.</P>

circumstance might have obliged Humaioon to raise the siege, had he not
been joined by Mahummud Sultan Mirza, Aligh Beg Mirza, Cusim Hussein
Sultan, Mahummud Mirick, Shere Askun Beg, Fusil Beg, and other omrahs, who,
disgusted with Mirza Camiran, had left his service. Some of the
besieged deserted also, and joined the king. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Candahar taken by capitulation.</NOTE>These
favorable circumstances revived the sink∣ing spirits of his army, and
equally depressed those of the besieged. Mirza Ashkari desired to
capitulate; his request was granted upon honorable terms; he gave up the
place, and, much ashamed of his former behavior, waited upon the king.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Put into the hands of the Persians.</NOTE>The
fort of Candahar, as had been stipulated with Shaw Tamasp, was given to his
son Mirza Murad. The winter having now come on, the young prince Murad,
Biddai Chan, Abul Fatte Sultan Af∣shâr, and Sufi Willi Sultan
Aridmullu, took up their quarters in the fort, without admitting the Mogul
omrahs. This so much disgusted them, that some, having no quarters,
went off to Cabul, while Mirza Ashkari, with a view of raising more
disturbance, also fled. Ashkari, however, was pursued, and brought back
prisoner.</P>

marched towards Cabul.

render themselves masters of the place. These omrahs, accordingly, sent

suggested their apprehensions from Mirza Camiran, and advised the king
to incamp somewhere near the city, which would fall into his hands in the

commanded in person. He gallantly opposed them hand to hand, and with his

ashamed of no villainy, told Camiran, that, as the greatest part of the

join him in the action. Ca∣miran did not let this favorable opportunity slip
through his hands. He returned, by the way of Kipchach, whither, the king,

enterprizing: But the clemency of his disposition hindered him from using
his victories in a manner which suited the vices of the times. Had he been
less mild and religious, he would have been a more successful prince: Had
he been a worse man, he would have been a greater monarch.</P>

to Punjab, to acquaint Akbar of the accident which had befallen his father. Not
many days after, the news of his father's death came to the prince at
Callanore. The Omrahs, who were present, after expressing their grief for
the deceased, raised Akbar to the throne, on the <PB N="210" REF="218"/>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Byram's wife administra∣tion.</NOTE>Byram
Chan, on the accession of Akbar, became absolute re∣gent, and had the
whole civil and military power of the empire in his hands. The first orders
issued from the throne, after dis∣patching the letters of proclamation,
were, to prohibit the ex∣action of Peshcush money, from the farmers; to let
all goods pass toll-free, and to prevent the injurious practice of
pressing labourers to the war.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Abul impri∣soned at La∣hore.</NOTE>Not many
days after the accession of Akbar, Shaw Abul Mali, who began to discover
treasonable intentions, was seized and imprisoned in Lahore. He, however,
found means, some time after, to escape; and Pulwan Gul, the Cutwal, to
whose charge he was committed, killed himself.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Akbar de∣feats Secun∣der Shaw.</NOTE>The king
led his army towards the hills, with a view to ex∣terminate the party of
Secunder Shaw: he defeated Secunder, and obliged him to fly farther among the
mountains; whither the imperial army could not pursue him. Akbar, in the mean
time, subdued the country of Nagracot; received the Raja of that pro∣vince
into favor; and the rains coming on, took up his quarters at Jallender.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mirza Soli∣mân rebels in
Buduchshan.</NOTE>In the mean time, Mirza Solimân, who had been left
gover∣nor of Buduchshan, threw off his allegiance, set up for himself,
and marched against Cabul. That city was defended by Monim Chan, the tutor of
Mahammud Hakim, the king's brother. Intelligence of this rebellion being
brought to Akbar, he imme∣diately detached Mahummud Kulli Chan Burlass, Chan
Azim, Chizer Chaja, and other Omrahs, to succour Monim Chan. 
<PB N="211" REF="219"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1555. Hig. 963.</NOTE>Some of those
Omrahs entered Cabul, while others encamped without, to harrass the
besiegers; which they continued to do for the space of four months. The
garrison, in the mean time, became to be distressed for provisions;
which obliged Monim Chan, to consent, that the chutba, for the kingdom of
Cabul, should be read in the name of Solimân. The rebel, after this
submission, raised the siege, and returned to Buduchshan.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cabul sub∣mits to him.</NOTE>During these
transactions at Cabul, Himu, the vizier of Mahummud Shaw Adili, of Bengal,
advanced towards Agra, with thirty thousand horse and two thousand
elephants. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Himu, the vizier of Shaw Adili, takes
Agra,</NOTE>He obliged Secunder Chan, the governor of that city, to retreat to
Delhi. Shadi Chan, an Afghan Omrah of Shaw Adili, in the mean time, raised an
army, and advanced to the banks of the Rehib; where Alli Kulli Chan Seistani,
entituled Chan Ziman, with three thousand horse, crossing the river,
attacked him, but was defeated; and carried only two hundred of his army,
alive, from the field; those who escaped the sword, being drowned in the
river.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">advances to Delhi,</NOTE>Himu having taken
Agra, marched towards Delhi, where Tirdi Chan commanded. Tirdi sent
expresses to all the Omrahs around, soliciting succours, and was joined
by Abdulla Chan, Lal Sultan Buduchshi, Alli Kulli Inderani, Merick Chan
Kullabi, and others; and then he thought himself in a condition to give the
enemy battle, without waiting for Chan Ziman; who, with several other Omrahs,
and a considerable reinforcement, was marching to his assistance. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">defeats Tirdi Beg, and takes Delhi.</NOTE>Himu,
who was a very valiant man, selected three thousand chosen horse, and
some of his best elephants, which he posted about his own person in the
center; and with which he charged Tirdi Beg so violently, that he drove him
quite off the field. Himu then fell, with great impetuosity, 
<PB N="212" REF="220"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1555. Hig. 963.</NOTE>upon the right wing,
which he routed so that the flight became general. This victory was so
compleat, that in consequence of it, the city immediately surrendered; and
Tirdi Beg, flying to Sirhind, left all the country open to the enemy. Chan
Zimani, having received intelligence of this disaster, at Merat, hastened
also to Sirhind.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The king in great per∣plexity.</NOTE>The king,
during these transactions, was at Jallender; and, finding all his
dominions, except Punjab, wrested from him, was greatly affected with the
news of Himu's success. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Devolves his power upon Byram Chan.</NOTE>He
called to him Byram Chan, then distinguished by the name of Chan Chanan,
and conferred upon him the honorable title of Chan Baba<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Baba signifies father.</NOTE>. He told that able man, that he
reposed his whole trust in his prudence and good conduct, in this perilous
situation of affairs, and desired that he might take whatever measures he
thought most conducive to retrieve his affairs. He, at the same time,
assured Byram, in the most solemn manner, that he would give no
attention to any malicious insinuations which might be suggested to the
royal ear by his enemies. The young prince having thus expressed the
genuine sentiments of his soul to Byram, he made him swear, by the soul
of his father Humaioon, and by the head of his own son, that he would be
faithful to the great trust, which was now reposed in him.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A council of war is called.</NOTE>A council of
war was immediately called, in which Byram Chan presided. The majority of the
Omrahs were of opinion, that as the enemy consisted of above a hundred
thousand horse, while the royal army scarce amounted to twenty
thousand, it would be most prudent to retreat to Cabul. Byram Chan
stre∣nuously opposed this measure, and was almost singular in his 
<PB N="213" REF="221"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1555. Hig. 963.</NOTE><NOTE PLACE="marg">It is resolved to engage the enemy.</NOTE>opinion, which was to
give battle instantly to the enemy. The young king joined Byram's
sentiments with so much warmth and gallant anxiety, that the Omrahs cried
out, in rapture, that their lives and fortunes were at his service.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The king marches a∣gainst
Himu.</NOTE>Immediate hostilities being resolved upon, Chaja Chizer Chan,
who was married to the king's aunt, Gulbaddin Begum, was appointed governor of
Lahore, to act against Secunder Shaw; while the king himself prepared, in
person, to chastise Himu. He marched to Sirhind, and was there joined by
his defeated Omrahs, who had assembled at that place.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Byram Chan punishes Tir∣di Beg.</NOTE>The
king being out, one day, at the diversion of hawking, Byram Chan, called
Tirdi Beg to his tent, and ordered him to be beheaded for abandoning Delhi,
where he might have defended himself, and for other unmilitary crimes, with
which he was justly charged. When Akbar returned, Byram Chan waited upon him,
and informed him of what he had done; he excused himself for not
acquainting the king of his intentions, by insinu∣ating, that he was certain
his royal clemency was so great, that notwithstanding Tirdi's crimes, he
would have forgiven him; which, at such a time, would be attended with very
dangerous consequences, as the hopes of the Moguls rested upon every
in∣dividual's strict performance of duty. He affirmed, that negligence was,
in such a critical situation, as great a crime as treason, and ought to
meet with an equal punishment. But that, on the other hand, desert should
meet with reward: for a dan∣gerous crisis, is the season of strict
justice, in both respects. Without his reward, the soldier becomes
languid and discon∣tented; when he fears no punishment, he becomes
negligent and insolent.</P>
<P> <PB N="214" REF="222"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1556. Higer. 964.</NOTE>The king saw
into the propriety of the measure, but he shud∣dered at the inhumanity of
the punishment. He, however, thanked Byram for the service which he had
done him; and, in∣deed, though the policy of that minister was severe, it
had the intended effect among the Omrahs. They saw that they had nothing to
hope, and every thing to fear from faction and bad behaviour; and therefore,
they became very obedient to the orders of Byram Chan.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Akbar mar∣ches towards Delhi.</NOTE>The king
soon after marched from Sirhind towards Delhi, detaching Secunder Chan,
Abdulla Chan, Alla Kulli Inderani, Lal Sultan, Mahummud Chan Jellaher, Mudjenu
Chan Cashkal, and others, under the command of Chan Ziman, Amir ul Omrah<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Captain-general.</NOTE>, some miles in his front. Himu,
who had assumed the title of Raja Bickermajit, in Delhi, having attached
Shadi Chan, and other Afghan Omrahs to his interest, marched out of that city
with all his forces; which, by the lowest computa∣tion, exceeded a hundred
thousand horse, besides elephants and infantry, with a great train of
artillery. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The van∣guard of the Afgans de∣feated.</NOTE>He
detached, in front, a great body of Afgans, with some artillery, which
falling in with Chan Ziman, were defeated by that general, with the loss of
all their guns, which proved a signal advantage to the king. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Himu arrives at Panniput.</NOTE>Himu having
arrived at Panniput, heard that the king was ad∣vanced very near him. He
divided his elephants, in which he greatly confided, among his principal
officers.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A general ac∣tion.</NOTE>In the morning of the
second of Mohirrim, 964, Chan Ziman, who had been, by that time, joined by
the whole army except a few, who remained to guard the king, drew up in order
of battle, and waited the attack. Himu began the action with his 
<PB N="215" REF="223"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1556. Higer. 964.</NOTE>elephants, in
hopes of frightening the Mogul cavalry, who were not accustomed to those
enormous animals. He, however, found that he was deceived. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Afgans broke.</NOTE>The Chigittai Omrahs,
either from a fear of the fate of Tirdi Beg, or from a nobler cause, their
own valor, attacked Himu, with such resolution, after he had pene∣trated
the center of the Mogul army, where Ziman commanded, that the elephants, galled
with lances, arrows and javelines, be∣came quite outrageous, and submitting
no longer to command, fell back and disordered the Afgan ranks.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The bravery of Himu.</NOTE>Himu, who rode a
prodigious elephant, still continued the action with great vigor, at the head
of four thousand horse, in the very heart of the Moguls; being at last,
pierced through the eye, with an arrow, the greatest part of his troops,
fearing that his wound was mortal, forsook him. But that valiant man, drew
the eye out of the socket, with the arrow; and, in that terrible condition,
continued the fight with unequalled resolution and courage. He encouraged the
few who remained by his side, and advanced through a bloody path which his
weapons made; till Kulli Chan Mhiram stretched his spear to kill the driver
of Himu's elephant: that timorous wretch, to save his own life, pointed to
Himu, and addressing him, by name, said, he would carry him
whithersoever he pleased. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">He is taken prisoner,</NOTE>Kulli Chan,
immediately surrounded him with a body of horse, and carried him prisoner
to Akbar, whom Byram Chan, as upon him rested the hopes of all, detained in
the rear.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">and slain.</NOTE>When the unfortunate Himu
was brought into the presence, almost expiring with his wounds, Byram Chan
told the king, that it would be a meritorious action in him, to kill that brave
infidel with his own hand. Akbar, in compliance to the advice of his tutor,
drew his sword, but only gently touched the head <PB N="216" REF="224"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1556. Higer. 964.</NOTE>of Himu,
bursting into tears of compassion. Byram, looking sternly upon the
king, insinuated, that the ill-timed clemency of his family, was the source
of all their misfortunes, and with one stroke of the sabre, severed
Himu's head from his body.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Akbar arrives at Delhi.</NOTE>Akbar took, in
this action, fifteen hundred elephants, and all the artillery of the enemy. He
immediately marched from the field, and took possession of Delhi. From
that city, he dis∣patched Mullu Pier Mahummud Shirwani, manager of the
private affairs of Byram, towards Mewat, to seize the treasure of Himu,
which was deposited in that place. This service was accomplished, with
some loss on the side of the Moguls; and the empire, in some measure,
returned to its former tranquillity.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION II. The History of SULTAN AKBAR, from the Death of
HIMU, to that of BYRAM CHAN.</HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Persians besiege and take
Kanda∣har.</NOTE>SULTAN HUSSEIN, the grandson of Shaw Ismaiel Suffvi
advanced, this year, by the orders of Shaw Tamasp of Iran, and laid siege
to Kandahar. After a sharp engagement, before the walls, with Mahummud
Kandahari, who commanded in the place, as deputy of Byram Chan, the city fell
into the hands of the Persians. Chizer Chaja Chan was, at the same time,
de∣feated by Secunder Shaw, and obliged to fly to Lahore.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The king marches to∣wards Punjab.</NOTE>The
king, having received intelligence of this double disaster, put his army in
motion, and marched towards Punjab. Secunder Shaw, who had advanced as far as
Callanore, retreated upon the <PB N="217" REF="225"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1556. Higer. 964.</NOTE>king's approach,
to the fort of Mancot, which had been built by Selim Shaw. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Besieges Se∣cunder Shaw in Mancot, and takes
that place by capitulation.</NOTE>Akbar besieged Secunder, in that
fortress, for the space of six months: he then began to treat about
surrendering the place, upon conditions; and Chan Azim being sent into the
fort to settle the terms of capitulation, Secunder proposed to that Omrah,
to give his son, as a hostage to the king, for his future obedience, if he
himself should be permitted to retire to Bengal. This being granted, on the
part of Akbar, Sheck Abul Rhiman, the son of Secunder Shaw, was, in the month
of Ramzan, 964, brought to the king, with presents, consisting chiefly of
ele∣phants. Secunder Shaw was permitted to retire to Bengal, and Mancot was
delivered up to Akbar. The king left a trusty governor in the place, and
proceeded to Lahore.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Byram Chan disgusted with the
king.</NOTE>Byram Chan, being privately disgusted at favors which the king
had conferred upon some persons, whom he suspected to be enemies to
himself, for some days, refused to come to court. The king, in the mean
time, happened to amuse himself with an elephant fight, and the outrageous
animals chanced to run over the tents of Byram Chan. The minister immediately
suspected, that this was done designedly by the king, and he sent to
ac∣quaint him: 
<Q REND="inline">"That he was sorry to see that he had
disobliged the king: but that, if he deserved Akbar's dislike, he would
be glad to know the crime he had committed, that he might be the better able to
make his excuse, and then, retire for ever from the presence."</Q> The king
was touched with an imputation, which his soul abhorred; but he
condescended to acquaint By∣ram, that the circumstance, from which his
ungenerous suspi∣cious arose, was a mere accident. This, however, did not
satisfy Byram Chan, who still continued to suspect that the king's mind
was estranged from him.</P>
<P> <PB N="218" REF="226"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1556. Higer. 964.</NOTE><NOTE PLACE="marg">Vindictive disposition of Byram.</NOTE>The king, soon after
this transaction, marched from Lahore to Delhi. Chaja Callan, who was proud
of his family, and of the signal services which he had rendered to the
king, set himself up to oppose Byram Chan in his administration. That
vindictive minister, to get rid of his antagonist, condemned him to death
upon very slight pretences, which raised great commotions among the Omrahs.
The king also expressed his dislike of this violent proceeding; for the
whole had been done without his orders.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Breach be∣tween him and the king.</NOTE>Upon
this occasion, high words arose between the king and his minister; and
the former, in a few days, set out for Agra. Though the king did not
discover what had passed between him and Byram, the cause of his
journey was no secret at court. The people sided with their young king, in
this quarrel, and the power of the minister began to decline visibly every
day. The enraged Byram, in the mean time, endeavored to recover his authority
by rigor and severity.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">He punishes the insolence of Pier
Ma∣hummud.</NOTE>Much about this time, Mullu Pier Mahummud, who had been
formerly a retainer of Byram Chan, was, on account of his great abilities,
preferred to the high office of tutor to the king. He soon engrossed a
great share of the king's favor; and the pride of advancement began to
swell in his heart. He used often to make the Omrahs, who attended his
levee, to wait whole hours, and, at last, to send them word that he could
not see them: which insolent behaviour gave great offence to many. Byram
Chan himself was little better treated, one day, by Mahummud; and he took it
so much amiss, that, by virtue of his own autho∣rity, he sent the tutor
prisoner to Biana, from thence he banished him to Guzerat, and there
shipped him off for Mecca, to prose∣cute his devotion.</P>
<P> <PB N="219" REF="227"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1556. Higer. 964.</NOTE><NOTE PLACE="marg">The king be∣ing offended, Byram pro∣jects an expe∣dition against
Gualier.</NOTE>The king was highly offended at this proceeding, as it seemed
to debar him from even the liberty of disposing of his own pri∣vate favors.
The artful minister, perceiving the Sultan's rage, projected an expedition
against Gualier, to divert the king's at∣tention to an other object. That
fortress was then in the possession of Bibil, one of the slaves of
Selim Shaw, who held it for Mahummud Shaw Adili. Bibil, hearing of Akbar's
design against him, wrote to Ram Shaw, a descendant of Raja Man Singh,
that as his ancestors had been masters of Gualier, and as he did not think
himself capable to hold out the place against the king, he would put it
into the possession of the Raja for a reasonable sum.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Gualier de∣livered up to Akbar.</NOTE>Ram Shaw,
glad at this offer, immediately moved towards the fort: but Kika Chan, who
possessed a jaghier from the king in the neighbourhood of Gualier,
raised all his vassals, and attacking Ram Shaw, defeated and drove him
into the domi∣nions of Rama. Kika, immediately after this victory, returned and
invested the fortress. Bibil, seeing himself thus besieged, made
overtures of capitulation. The king being informed of this circumstance,
ordered Chaja Mahummud Chan, with a de∣tachment, to give Bibil the terms he
required, and to sieze upon the fortress. The traitor accordingly, being
gratified with some money and a promise of future favour, delivered up the
impor∣tant castle of Gualier.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Actions of Chan Ziman.</NOTE>In the course of
the same year, Chan Ziman, to wipe off some aspersions under which he
lay, exerted himself in a particular manner in the king's service; for he
subdued all the provinces near Jionpoor and Benaris, which till then were in
the hands of the Patans.</P>
<P> <PB N="220" REF="228"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1556. Higer. 964.</NOTE><NOTE PLACE="marg">Transactions at court.</NOTE>Sheck Mahummud Ghori, the brother
of Sheck Phul, who having been firmly attached to the Chegittai, or Mogul
interest, during the late supremacy of the Patans, had fled to Guzerat,
this year returned to court with his family, and was very favourably received
by the king, who ordered Byram Chan to provide for him in a manner suitable
to his dignity. Mahum∣mud Ghori trusting too much to the king's authority,
neglected to pay that court to Byram Chan which that haughty minister
expected: Byram therefore took every possible means to avoid to serve
Mahummud, and made things so very disagreeable to him, that he left the
court and retired to his old family resi∣dence at Gualier.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An expedi∣tion against Malava.</NOTE>This
being represented to the king, revived his former dis∣content against
Byram Chan. The artful minister soon observed a visible alteration in
the countenance of his sovereign. He therefore formed an expedition against
Malava, to turn the king's active mind from the private politics of the court.
Byram ac∣cordingly called Bahadur, the brother of Chan Ziman from Debalpoor,
and gave him the command of the army destined to act against Baz Bahadur,
who then ruled over Malava.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Transactions at court.</NOTE>The king much
about this time went out upon a hunting party, and made a progress as far as
Secundra, within forty miles of Delhi, between the rivers. Mahim his
foster-brother joined him there, and told him, that his mother was extremely
ill at Delhi, and was very desirous to see the king. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Great power of Byram Chan.</NOTE>He imme∣diately
set out for Delhi, and Shabul dien Ahmed Chan Neisha∣puri, an Omrah of five
thousand, who then commanded in the city, came out to meet Akbar with
presents: that Omrah was in great perplexity how to act. He was assured,
that Byram Chan would impute the king's journey to Delhi to his intrigues, 
<PB N="221" REF="229"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1557. Higer. 965.</NOTE>and would not fail
to get rid of him, as he had done of Mu∣suai Beg; he therefore acquainted the
king of his apprehen∣sions, and begged he might be permitted to make a
pilgrimage to Mecca. The king was very much affected upon hearing this
request, by observing how formidable the power of his minister was become
to all his friends; but after he had considered the many obligations under
which he and his family lay to that able man, he could not think of removing
him: to lessen how∣ever, in some measure, the apprehensions of Ahmed
Chan, the king wrote Byram that he had of his own accord proceeded to Delhi,
and not at the instigation of any person, but merely to pay his respects
to his mother; that therefore a letter from him to appease the minds of
those who were apprehensive of his displeasure, would be extremely
necessary. Byram Chan re∣turned for answer, that 
<Q REND="inline">"he should never entertain resentment
against any whom the king was pleased to honor with his favor."</Q> He
moreover sent Hadjee Mahummud Seistani and Tirdi Beg to Delhi, with
assurances of his loyalty and absolute obedience to the king's royal
pleasure.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A faction ac∣cuses him to the king.</NOTE>In
the mean time, Shabuldien Ahmed Chan finding the king disposed to protect
him, and to hear accusations against Byram Chan, gave a loose to his
tongue one day in public against that minister. He was joined by the whole
court, whom he had previously attached to his interest. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A breach be∣tween him and the king.</NOTE>In
short, so many crimes were alledged against Byram Chan, particularly his
designs in favor of Abul Casim, the son of Mirza Cameran, that the king
was alarmed and thought it necessary to curtail his authority. When
therefore Hadjee Mahummud and Tirdi Beg arrived, in∣stead of being admitted
to an audience, they were immediately imprisoned.</P>
<P> <PB N="222" REF="230"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1557. Higer. 965.</NOTE><NOTE PLACE="marg">Transactions at court.</NOTE>This breach between the king and
Byram Chan, is related with other particulars by Abul Fazil. One day at Agra,
says that great man, one of the king's elephants in the r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tting season, attacked an elephant
of Byram Chan and killed him. Byram, for this offence, commanded that the
keeper of the king's ele∣phants should be put to death, without giving any
notice to the sultan. Akbar was greatly displeased with this piece of
cruelty, especially when he found that the poor man was innocent, having
lost all his command over the outrageous animal. Soon after, continues Abul
Fazil, as Byram Chan was taking his pleasure in a barge on the river, one of
the elephants, which had been carried down to the water, run furiously
against the barge, and had almost sunk it, before, by the uncommon
efforts of the rider, he was brought to obedience. The minister, na∣turally
of a suspicious and unforgiving temper, imagined that these were actually
plots laid against his life; and he publickly petitioned the king to punish
the rider of the elephant. The king, to appease Byram, and to remove all
suspicions, ordered that the elephant-rider should be sent to him, to
be punished at discretion. But Byram, either to make an example to others,
or to gratify his resentment against the innocent man, who might even be
said to have saved his life, ordered him also to be put to death.</P>
<P>The king was highly incensed by these two instances of
Byram's presumption and cruelty. His displeasure became visible to the
court; and there were not wanting many, who made it their business by
private insinuations, to encrease his resentment. The king, at length,
came to the resolution of depriving Byram of the reins of government, which
required some delicacy in the present situation of affairs. Some authors
mention a scheme <PB N="223" REF="231"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1558. Higer. 966.</NOTE>suggested to
Akbar by his nurse<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This was she that the king went
to visit at Delhi.</NOTE>, upon this occasion, to get possession of
the seals which were in Byram Chan's possession. They also say,
that she discovered to him that minister's design to confine him, which
she had accidentally heard, in a conversa∣tion between Byram and the
queen-mother. This, say they, was the circumstance that determined Akbar to
leave Agra. Abul Fazil mentions nothing of this affair; for that historian
informs us, with greater probability, that the whole was con∣certed between
Adam Chan and Mahim Anigah, on the part of the young king, who now began to be
tired of a tutor, and thought he was capable of acting for himself. But to
return from this digression.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Byram Chan is disgraced.</NOTE>When it became
public that the deputies from Byram Chan had been imprisoned by the king,
every body predicted the ruin of the minister, and endeavoured to shake him
off as fast as possi∣ble. They flocked daily to Akbar by hundreds to
Delhi. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The king takes the ad∣ministration of affairs

expedition against Cashmire; 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">He is defeat∣ed,</NOTE>but they were defeated
with great slaughter. Mali flying to Debalpoor, joined himself with Bahadur

<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1558. Higer. 966.</NOTE>thence to
Jionpoor, from whence Chan Ziman, by the order of Byram Chan, sent him
prisoner to Agra. He was sent to per∣petual imprisonment in the fort of
Biana.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Various schemes of Byram Chan.</NOTE>Byram
Chan, finding that he had no farther hopes from the king, began to form a
resolution of going to Malava, to reduce that country, and found an
independant kingdom. To accom∣plish his purpose, he proceeded to Biana, and
called Bahadur Chan and other Omrahs, who had been sent upon the expedition
to Malava before him. But perceiving that he was deserted by those Omrahs,
in whom he placed his chief confidence, he began to despair of succeeding
in that enterprize. He, therefore, re∣leased Abul Mali from his confinement,
intending by his assist∣ance and that of Chan Ziman, to attack the Patans
of Bengal, and to fix himself in that kingdom. But before he had pro∣ceeded
many days on this scheme, he changed his resolution, and took the way of
Nagore, with a design to make a pilgrimage to Mecca; upon which, Bahadur
Chan, Kika Chan, and many other Omrahs, who had determined to follow his
fortunes, took leave of him. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">His irresolute behaviour.</NOTE>But so
irresolute was the unfortunate Byram be∣come, at a time too when firmness,
constancy, and perseverance were absolutely necessary, that, like a
person infatuated, he had no sooner reached Nagore, after having lost all
his friends, than he changed again his resolution of going to Mecca, and
be∣gan to assemble troops, with a view to conquer Punjab.</P>
<P>When the king was informed of this new scheme of Byram's, he
sent Meer Abdul Latîf Shusvini, his own preceptor, with a message
to him to the following purpose. 
<Q REND="inline"><NOTE PLACE="marg">The king's message to

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">He resolves to go to Mecca.</NOTE>Byram Chan,
upon receiving this letter, professed passive obe∣dience, and sent
his ensigns of state, elephants, banners and drums, by the hand of
Hussen Kulli Beg Zul Kudder, to the king. He then returned to Nagore, to
prepare for Mecca, being now abandoned by all his friends, except Willi Beg Zul
Kuddur, Ismaiel Kulli Chan, Shaw Kulli Chan Merhum, Hassen Chan Tughlich,
Shech Gaddai, and Chaja Muziffer Alli Jurbutti, the rest having joined the
king. Among the latter, was Abul Mali, who, coming up to Akbar when hunting,
neglected to dismount, when he made his obeisance, for which he was
immediately confined.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Repents of his resolution, and levies
forces.</NOTE>Byram Chan having proceeded on his pilgrimage as far as
Bickanere, repented of his resolution, and returned again to Na∣gore, where
he began to assemble troops. The king being in∣formed of that proceeding,
marched to Jidger. Mulla Pier Mahummud, being now returned from his
banishment, to which he had been condemned by Byram Chan, was thought a
proper person to carry on the war against him. He was accordingly dignified
with titles by the king, and sent with an army to∣wards Nagore. The king, in
the mean time, returned to Delhi, and sent orders to Monim Chan, at Cabul, to
repair to court.</P>

take charge of his baggage. Byram Chan set out from thence for Debalpoor,
which was then governed by one of his old friends, Dirvesh Mahummud Usbeck.
When he came near the place, he sent his secretary, Chaja Mu∣ziffer Ali, to
wait upon him, but that ungrateful man, pretend∣ing to be affronted at Byram's
request, confined the secretary, and sent him to the king. Byram Chan,
who had conceived great hopes from his friendship, was astonished at a
behaviour so common to men in adversity, and set out, in great
perturbation of mind, towards Jallender.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Defeated.</NOTE>The king had, by this time,
recalled Pier Mahummud Chan, and appointed Chan Azim to reduce Punjab, and to
quell the rebellion of Byram Chan. Chan Azim coming up soon after with Byram
Chan, at Matchiwarrah, a battle ensued, which was maintained with great
bravery on both sides; Chan Azim's line being broke by the enemy:

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Byram Chan submits.</NOTE>Akbar immediately
dispatched Mulla Abdulla Sultanpuri, with assurances of his clemency, and

number of Omrahs, whom the king had ordered to meet him. He was brought into
the presence with every possible mark of favor and distinction. When he
appeared within sight of the king, he hung his turban round his neck, and
suddenly advancing, threw himself, in tears, at the foot of the throne. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Is received with every mark of dis∣tinction by

dispel at once his uneasiness and grief, the king honored him with a
splendid chelat; and spoke to him after the following manner.

have the govern∣ment of Calpé and Chinderi, in which he may exercise

then should I remain in the presence? The clemency of the king is enough
for me, and his forgiveness for my late errors, a sufficient reward for my
former services. Let then the unfortunate Byram turn his face from this world

<HEAD>SECTION III. The Transactions of AKBAR from the Death of
BYRAM CHAN, to the total Defeat of the rebellious USBECK Omrahs.</HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Akbar sends an army a∣gainst
Malava.</NOTE>TOWARDS the close of the year 968, Sultan Akbar ap∣pointed Adam
Chan and Pier Mahummud to command an army destined for the conquest of
Malava. Bas Bahadur in whose hands that country was then, spent his time in
luxurious pleasures at Saringpoor, when he was informed of the expe∣dition
which the Moguls meditated against him: but the enemy <PB N="229" REF="239"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1560. Higer. 968.</NOTE>had advanced
within ten crores of his capital, before he could prevail with himself to
quit the pillows of indolence; and then in the best manner the time and his
own confusion would per∣mit, he prepared for action. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Which is re∣duced.</NOTE>But the bold Chigittai
upon the first onset shook his order of battle, and sent him with
stream∣ing eyes and a broken heart towards Burhanpoor.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The king sus∣pecting Adam of treasonable
intentions, marches to∣wards him.</NOTE>Adam Chan after the victory
distributed the spoil and the governments of Malava among his Omrahs,
reserving the trea∣sure, royal ensigns, and the ladies of the Haram for
himself. He sent nothing except a few elephants to the king of what was
customary on those occasions. Akbar fearing from this behaviour, that he
entertained treasonable intentions, put the royal standard in motion
towards him. When the imperial ensigns appeared before Shakeran, the governor
of that fort on the part of Bas Bahadur, delivered it up to the king. The
Sultan from thence made a sudden excursion by night, and in the morning
arrived before Saringpoor. He met Adam Chan com∣ing out with an intention to
besiege Shakeran: he permitted that Omrah to pay his respects, and then he
carried him back to the city. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">He submits, and is par∣doned.</NOTE>Adam Chan
suspecting the king's displeasure and the cause of his visit, laid
all the treasure and spoil at his feet: he excused himself by
alledging, that he reserved every thing till he should have the honour of
presenting them to Akbar in person. The king saw through his designs,
but preferring cle∣mency to rigour, he drew the pen of forgiveness over his
crime.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Akbar kills an enormous ty∣gress.</NOTE>The
king soon after returned towards Agra; hunting one day on the way near
Narvar, a great royal tygress with five young ones took the road before him.
Akbar advanced to the animal, while his retinue stood trembling with fear and
astonishment to behold the event. The king having meditated his blow,
spurred <PB N="230" REF="240"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1561. Higer. 969.</NOTE>on his horse
towards the fierce tygress, whose eyes flamed with rage, and with one
stroke of his sabre, cut her across the loins and stretched her dead
upon the ground. The Omrahs who were present, in excess of joy, ran to
kiss his royal stirrup, and offer up their thanks to God for his
preservation.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The son of Shaw Adili invading Jion∣poor is
over∣thrown by Chan Ziman.</NOTE>The king having remained some months at
Agra, Sheri Chan the son of Mahummud Shaw Adili, with 40,000 horse,
advan∣ced from Bengal to reduce the province of Jionpoor. He was opposed by
Chan Ziman with 12,000 horse, and received a total defeat. Bahadur Chan the
brother of Chan Ziman, distinguished himself in a very particular manner
in this action; so that the two brothers were esteemed the boldest
warriors of the age: but reckoning too much on their services, they neglected
to send to the king the elephants which they had taken in the battle, which
were always considered as royal property.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The king dis∣satisfied with Chan
Ziman.</NOTE>The king, though he gave to the brothers all due praise for
their valour, would by no means permit any violation of his laws or
encroachment upon his prerogative: this determined him to march towards
Jionpoor, 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Who submits himself to his royal
clemen∣cy.</NOTE>but when he had arrived at Kurrah, the brothers, sensible
of his resolution and their own misbeha∣viour, advanced to congratulate him
with all the spoils which they had taken, and other suitable presents.
The king, whose generosity and clemency could be only equalled by his
spirit, returned all, except what belonged properly to the exchequer. At the
same time he gave them a gentle reproof for their neglect, and afterwards
engaged their affections by his princely bounty and gracious favour. The king
returning to Agra, on the third day's march gave the brothers permission to
go back to Jion∣poor.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1561. Higer. 969.</NOTE><NOTE PLACE="marg">Promotions at court.</NOTE>By the time that the king had reached
Agra, Chan Azim viceroy of Punjab, and Adam Chan governor of Malava, arrived at
court according to orders, with suitable presents. The king gave the
government of Malava to Pier Mahummud Chan, and the office of prime minister
to Chan Azim.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The king makes a pro∣gress to
Aj∣mere.</NOTE>The king after these transactions in the year 969, made a
progress to Ajmere, to visit the shrine of Chaja Moin ul Dien: when Akbar
arrived at Sumbre, Raja Birbil of that country gave his daughter to him in
marriage, and listed himself and his son Bowan Dass, among the number
of the king's Omrahs. When Akbar had reached Ajmere, and had performed his
devotions, he sent Mirza Shirrif ul dein Hussein, governor of Ajmere, to
invest the fort of Mertah, which was in the territories of Raja Maldeo of
Marwar. He himself returned in three days and nights, with a retinue of six
persons only to Agra, which was a distance of more than one hundred and
thirty crores.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mirza Hus∣sein besieges
Mertah.</NOTE>Mirza Hussein having advanced near Mertah, Jig Jal and Dewan
Dass, who were principal Omrahs of that country, threw a detachment into the
place and prepared for a siege. Mirza Hussein invested the fort, and
began to carry on his ap∣proaches. In a few days he extended one of his mines
under a bastion, and sprung it, by which a practicable breach was made. He
advanced in person with a select body of troops to the assault, while
the enemy bravely filled the breach to oppose him. Tho' fresh supplies of
troops mounted from time to time, they were so warmly received, that
Hussein was obliged to sound a retreat, and the next morning he found
that the breach was filled up by the Rajaputs, who had continued to work,
notwithstanding the fire he had kept up the whole night. The siege being
prolonged for some months, the brave garrison were unable to hold out

request was granted, and the terms were, that they should march out with
all their arms and horses.</P>
<P>Jig Jal according to these terms left all his money and effects,
and marched forth; but Dewan Dass, who had been averse to the capitulation,
collected five hundred of the garrison together, and having burnt all their
effects, they rushed out of the place. Mirza Hussein having heard of this
breach of the capitulation, ordered them to be attacked, and the Rajaputs on
the other hand fought with such valour, that they cut their way through the
Mogul army with the loss of two hundred and fifty of their number. Among the
slain was Dewan Dass, whose head his friends carried away when they saw
him mortally wounded, that it might not fall into the hands of the enemy. Mirza
Hussein after having possessed himself of the fort, wrote an
account of his victory to the king, and was honoured with par∣ticular
favours.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Transactions in the pro∣vince of

Shadi-abad-mendu, and carried on the war with Bas Bahadur with such
success, that he entirely possessed him∣self of his dominions. He
took the strong fort of Bijanagur, and put all the garrison to the sword,
as they obliged him to risque an assault. Bas Bahadur having taken
protection under the governor of Brampoor on the borders of Chandez, he
some∣times by the aid of that Omrah, made incursions into the territories
of Malava, and kept the country in a state of hosti∣lity. Pier Mahummud
Chan was obliged to march against Brampoor, and having taken it, ordered a
cruel massacre of all <PB N="233" REF="243"/>

among whom was a number of philosophers and learned men, who resided in the

prevailed upon Miran Mubarick Shaw and Tiffâl Chan, the former prince of
Candez, and the latter of Berar, to join him, advanced with a great army
towards the Mogul, upon which he retreated to Bijanagur, his Omrahs being all
averse to engage. However he resolved to halt at Bijanagur contrary to all
their opinions, and to give battle to the enemy. He did it, but not being
supported by his officers, he was defeated, and being dis∣mounted by a
camel that attacked his horse in crossing the rapid river Narbudda, he
was drowned. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Malava lost to the empire.</NOTE>The enemy
continuing the pursuit, drove the Moguls from place to place, as far as Agra,
without being able to make one stand before them: so that Bas Bahadur in
the year 969, recovered his whole domi∣nions of Malava.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Malava re∣covered.</NOTE>The king immediately
after this disaster, appointed Abdulla Chan Usbeck governor of Calpee, to
carry on the war against Bas Bahadur. This Omrah drove him a second time
out of his country among the mountains of Comilmere. Abdulla Chan
possessed himself of Mindu, and fixed his residence in that
city.</P>

himself of two lacks of rupees from the king.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Designs of Adam Chan against the prime

in his ministerial office. Adam Chan envying his great∣ness, 
<PB N="234" REF="244"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1561. Higer. 969.</NOTE>attempted to bring
about his ruin, as some courtiers had before done that of Byram Chan: but the
intrigues of Adam were discovered, and his calumnies reverted upon his own
head. Stung with disappointed malice, he at last determined to act the
assassin himself. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">He basely as∣sassinates him.</NOTE>He
accordingly one day in the audience cham∣ber, while the minister was reading
the Koran, stabbed him under pretence that he took no notice of the
salutation which Adam made him at his entrance, though he well knew, that at
such a time it was not customary to make or return any compli∣ments. Adam
after having committed this horrid murder, ascended one of the terraces, and
stood there in hopes of the king's pardon, though he might possibly have
escaped.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Adam is killed by the king.</NOTE>The king who
had been asleep in the Haram, hearing the noise that was made on this
occasion, asked the cause. When they informed him of what had happened,
he arose, and without changing his sleeping dress, went up to the terrace
in a great rage. He was struck with horror when he saw the blood of his
Vizier. Having approached the murderer with a sword in his hand, he drew it
half out, but reflecting upon his own dignity, he returned it again into the
scabbard, and sternly asked the assassin, Why have you killed my
Vizier? The wretch, fearing that the king was going to kill him, seized his
hands. This behaviour so enraged Akbar, that disengaging himself, he
struck him a blow with his fist, and stretched him senseless at his
feet. In this rage he ordered one of his attendants to throw the wretch over
the wall, which was forty guzes<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A guze is about a yard
English.</NOTE> in heighth. Mahim Anigah, this unfortunate man's father, died
with grief about a month after, and Monim Chan who was an abettor of the
assassination of the Vizier, fled to Lahore, where he was seized and
sent to Agra: but as the proofs against him were not <PB N="235" REF="245"/>

Punjab, the Omrahs of that country were ordered to reduce him, and place Kummal
Chan one of the same nation, upon the musnud. Kummal Chan had been once
miraculously preserved from death. Selim Shaw ordered a prison, wherein
he was at Gualier, with some hun∣dreds of Gickers who had been taken
prisoners, to be blown up with gunpowder. This was done, and Kummal was
thrown to some distance, without receiving any considerable hurt. The

reduced that fierce nation, and took Sultan Adam prisoner.</P>
<P>Chaja Moin the father of Shirrif ul Dein Hussein, came about

might with truth be said to have ruled that kingdom. He then pretended to act
as regent for the young prince, who was still in his minority, with a view to
get rid of him as soon as he could conciliate matters with the Omrahs. In the

fixed an arrow in his bow and pointed it towards the sky. The royal retinue,
imagining that the villain was going to shoot at some bird flying overhead,
gazed upward: he immediately lowered his aim to the king, who was at some
distance upon his elephant, and let fly his arrow, which lodged itself
some inches deep in Akbar's shoulder. In a moment a thousand swords
were drawn, and the people cut one another, each anxious to kill the
assassin, who was in a moment hewn to pieces. The surgeons being
called, the arrow was, with great difficulty, extracted on the place, before

drove them, with great difficulty, into a kedda or fold constructed for that
purpose: one of the male ele∣phants, of a prodigious size, finding
himself confined, strode over the ditch, bore down the wall and the
pallisadoes before him, and made his way into the plain. Three trained
elephants were sent after him: he stood to fight, and before they could

remarkably fond of the boisterous contention of those enor∣mous

proposed to confine all the <PB N="239" REF="249"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1564. Higer. 972.</NOTE>Omrahs of that
nation who were in his service. This calumny gained so much credit, that
Secunder Chan, Ibrahim Chan Usbeck, and others, who had governments about
Jionpoor and Behar, turned their heads from obedience, and drew over Chan
Ziman, Bahadur Chan, and Shubiani Chan to their party: Asaph Chan Hirrevi,
who held the government of Kurrah, on account of some disputes with the
collector of the king's revenues, took part in their rebellion. In a short
time, their army con∣sisted of thirty thousand horse, with which they
possessed them∣selves of all the territories near Behar and
Jionpoor.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The policy of Akbar.</NOTE>News of this
rebellion being brought to the king, he seemed to take no notice of it. He
ordered his troops to attend him on a hunting party towards Narvar, in the
opposite direction to the enemy. He accordingly employed himself in taking
elephants for some days; during which time, Asherif Chan, a scribe, was
sent privately to Secunder Chan, to endeavor to bring him over from his
faction. Lashkar Chan Bukshi, was sent with a great body of horse to
seize the treasures of Asaph Chan, upon whom the king had a large demand,
which was the sole cause of that Omrah's rebellion.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A digression concerning Asaph Chan's war
with the queen of Gur∣rah.</NOTE>It seems, that when Asaph Chan was made an
Omrah of five thousand, and obtained the government of Kurrah and Maneckpoor,
he obtained permission of the king to subdue a country called Gurrah or
Kattuck, lying between the provinces of Rintimpore, Malava, Behar and the
Decan. At that time, the kingdom of Gurrah<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Now part of
Orissa and Bundel-cund.</NOTE> was governed by a queen, whose name was
Durgautti, famous for her beauty and accomplishments: her dominions were
about one hundred and fifty crores in length, <PB N="240" REF="250"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1564. Higer. 972.</NOTE>and about fifty in
breadth: yet so flourishing was the country, that in this small tract,
there were about seventy thousand towns and villages well inhabited; which
had the good fortune never to have fallen under the dominion of foreigners.</P>
<P>Asaph Chan, having heard of the riches of this country,
dis∣turbed the peaceable inhabitants, unaccustomed to the sound of war,
with constant depredations; he at length marched against them with six
thousand horse, and about double that number of infantry. The queen, with
fifteen hundred elephants, eight thousand horse and some foot, prepared
to oppose him. Like a bold Heroine she led on her troops to action,
cloathed in armour, with a helmet upon her head, mounted in a howdar, on an
ele∣phant, with her bow and quiver lying by her side, and a burnished lance
in her hand. Though her troops had not been accustomed to action, the love of
liberty, and the example of their queen, inspired every breast with a
lion's courage. Their eagerness to engage, made them march in disorder
towards the enemy, which the queen observing, commanded them to halt, and
forming her line anew, gave her troops strict orders to march on slowly, as
compact as possible, and to observe the signal to engage, when it
should be displayed from the elephant of the royal standard.</P>
<P>In this manner she received the enemy, whom she quickly
re∣pulsed, and pressing upon them, laid six hundred Mahommedan
horsemen dead on the field; she pursued the rest till the evening, with
great slaughter. When night came on, the queen halted with her army, and gave
them orders to wash and refresh them∣selves, that they might be prepared
for a night attack upon the enemy, before they could recover from their
consternation. But her vizier, and the rest of her chiefs, less daring,
and conse∣quently <PB N="241" REF="251"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1564. Higer. 972.</NOTE>less prudent
than this heroine, opposed this salutary mea∣sure, and seditiously
insisted on returning to the field of battle to bury their friends. She,
accordingly, returned unwillingly; and, after the dead were burnt, again
addressed her chiefs, and soli∣cited them, one by one, to accompany her
to storm the Mahom∣medan camp: none of them, however, had the spirit to
second her in this daring enterprize. They vainly imagined, that the enemy
would of their own accord evacuate the country.</P>
<P>The Omrahs of Gurrah, soon found that they were fatally
frustrated in their hopes. Asaph Chan, to wipe away the dis∣grace which
he sustained the day before, and finding what enemy he had to deal with,
advanced in the morning towards the queen, with his artillery; which, in the
preceding action, he had left behind him, on account of the badness of the
roads. The queen, upon Asaph's approach, advanced to a narrow pass, and
prepared to oppose him. The Mogul, scouring the pass with his artillery,
soon opened to himself a way into the plain beyond it, where the queen's
army were drawn up in order of battle. Raja Bier Shaw, the queen's son, a
young prince of great hopes, as soon as the Mahommedan army came into the
plain, made a resolute charge, and exhibited prodigies of valour. He
repulsed the enemy twice, but in the third attack, being wounded, he became
faint with loss of blood. When he was just falling from his horse, his
mother, who was mounted on an elephant in the front of the battle, observed
her son ready to expire. She immediately called to some of her people to
carry him back to the rear; many of them accordingly crowded around him, some
with a friendly in∣tention to serve him, but more to have an opportunity to
quit the field. The loss of the Raja, in short, together with the retreat
of so many with his body, struck a pannic into the rest, so that the
unfortunate queen was left with only three hundred men in <PB N="242" REF="252"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1564. Higer. 972.</NOTE>in the field. The
heroine, however, seemed no ways affected by her desperate situation;
she stood her ground with her former fortitude, till she received an
arrow in her eye; she endeavoured to extricate it from the wound, but as
she tugged it, part of the steel broke short, and remained behind. In the
mean time, another arrow passed through her neck, which she also drew
out, but nature sinking under the pain, a dimness swam before her eyes,
and she began to nod from side to side of the howdar<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A wooden tower on the back of the elephant.</NOTE>. She, however,
recovered from her fainting by degrees; and a brave officer of her houshold,
by name Adhar, who drove her elephant, singly repulsed numbers of the enemy
whithersoever he turned the outragious animal; begged permission, as the
day was now irretrievable, to carry the queen from the field. She re∣jected the
proposal with a noble disdain: 
<Q REND="inline">"It is true, said she, we are overcome in war,
but shall we ever be vanquished in honor? Shall we, for the sake of a
lingering ignominious life, lose that reputation and virtue which we have
been so solicitous to ac∣quire? No: let your gratitude now repay that
service for which I lifted up your head, and which I now require at your
hands. Haste, I say; let your dagger save me from the crime of putting a
period to my own existence."</Q></P>
<P>Adhar burst into tears, and begged, that as the elephant was
swift of foot, he might be permitted to leave the field, and carry her to a
place of safety. In the mean time, the queen, finding that the enemy crowded
fast around her, and that she must be taken prisoner, she, suddenly
leaning forward, seized the dagger of Adhar, and plunging it into her
bosom, expired. The death of the queen, rendered Asaph Chan's victory
compleat. Six Hindoo chiefs, upon their elephants, still stood firm: and
ashamed <PB N="245" REF="253"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1564. Higer. 972.</NOTE>of being outdone
by a woman, dedicated their lives to revenge the death of the queen.</P>
<P>Asaph Chan, a few days after this battle, laid siege to
Joragur, where all the treasures of this noble family had been for ten
ge∣nerations deposited. The hopes of gain rendered the Moguls desperate;
they begun to attack the fort with uncommon resolu∣tion, till the place was
taken. The young Raja, bravely exert∣ing what little strength he had left,
lost his life in defence of his independence and kingdom. The unfortunate
garrison, accord∣ing to their barbarous custom, had performed the joar<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The joar, is a general massacre of the women and
children.</NOTE>. This dreadful ceremony was performed after this manner: a
house was filled with wood, straw and oil; the unfortunate victims were
forced in, and fire set to the horrid pile. When the bloody con∣querors, who
had brought this dreadful calamity upon the miser∣able Hindoos, entered the
place, they found two women still alive, and untouched by the flames; one of
them was called Camela∣willi, the sister of the deceased queen, and the
other the daughter of the Raja of Biragur, who had been brought to be
espoused by the young Raja of Gurrah. These two ladies were reserved by
Asaph Chan, for the king. The riches of Joragur, in gold, silver, jewels
and precious effects were invaluable; of gold alone, there were found, in one
treasury, one hundred and one chests of mhers. When Asaph Chan had
glutted his avarice and ambition with the blood and treasure of this brave,
though peace∣able family, he took up his residence in that country. His view
was to maintain his conquest agaist the king; and he, therefore, did not
return to his government of Kurrah. That avarice, which prompted him to this
public robbery, prevented him from pre∣senting the king with his part of the
plunder. Out of a thousand <PB N="244" REF="254"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1564. Higer. 972.</NOTE>elephants, which
he had taken, though all should fall to the share of the king, he sent
him only two hundred of the worst, and sent no part of the jewels and
treasure. It was therefore this just demand which the king had upon
Asaph, that made that ambitious Omrah join in rebellion with the
disaffected Usbecks.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The king marches against Asaph Chan: falls
sick and re∣turns.</NOTE>The king having found that Lashkar Chan could
effect nothing against Asaph, he determined to march in person into

they were defeated, and the two last taken prisoners. The king apprized of
this disaster, sent Menim Chan Chanan with an army some days journey in

retreat with great loss towards the body of the army, which by this time was

Chan, concluded the victory already their own, pur∣suing in an irregular
manner, were received so warmly by Ba∣hadur Chan, that they were repulsed

act of clemency, or rather weakness in the king, he obtained, as well as a
confirmation of all his estates and honors. The king after passing his
royal word for all these favours, ordered Ziman to come to court: but the
traitor excused him∣self, by pretending that shame for his past
offences would not permit him to appear in the presence, till time should
erase his behaviour from his majesty's mind; that as soon as the king

turned towards the center, where the king commanded in person: Akbar
observing him, came down from his elephant, and mounting a horse,
pressed towards him; but by this time an arrow having killed Bahadur Chan's
horse, he was obliged to retreat on foot, among his own troops. The king

ordered that particular care should be taken of Bahadur; but some of the

would pardon that consummate rebel, prevented it by putting him immediately
to the sword. Akbar, though it is highly probable that he would have forgiven

Sultan Mahummud Mirza, who had possessed themselves of Mindu, hearing
of the emperor's progress, were greatly distressed. To compleat their
misfortunes, Aligh Mirza died at that time, and his adherents fled with
precipi∣tation towards Guzerat.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The king in∣vests Chitor.</NOTE>The king left
Malava under the charge of Shab ul dein Ahmed Shaw Neshapuri, and marched
from Kakeran to expel the Rana from Chitor. The Rana left eight thousand
disciplined Rajaputs, with a great store of provisions in the fort of
Chitor, which is built on a mountain, and retired himself with his family to
an inaccessible place. The king immediately invested Chitor, and set
five thousand pioneers to work in throwing up trenches, and carrying on
approaches to the place. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An accident in carrying on the

different bastions, he endevoured to spirng them at once: but one of them

<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1567. Higer. 975.</NOTE>a practicable
breach. Two thousand men who were prepared to storm, advanced immediately,
upon a supposition that both of the mines had been sprung. They divided
into two bodies in order to enter at once both breaches: one of the parties
advanc∣ing near the bastion, perceived that the mine had not been sprung,
but before they could retreat it blew up, and killed above five hundred of the
Moguls, and about double that number of the enemy who were crouded on the
bastion. Among the latter were fifteen Omrahs of distinction. The
explosion so terrified those who were entering the breach, that they
retreated in the utmost consternation.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The king kills the governor of Chitor with his

was one day standing in one of the batteries, he perceived Jeimal the
governor of the place very assiduous in filling up the breaches, and giving
orders for the defence: the king immedi∣ately called for a fuzee, and took so
good an aim that he lodged the ball in Jeimal's brains, and laid him dead on
the spot.</P>
<P>The spirit of the besieged fell with their chief, and in the
utmost despair, they performed the horrid ceremony of the Joar, put all
their wives and children to the sword, and burned their bodies with that of
their governor, on a prodigious funeral pile. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chitor stormed.</NOTE>The Imperial army
perceived what was going on by the light of the fire: they advanced under the
cover of night to the breach, which they found abandoned, so that they
entered the place without opposition. It was day-light before a number
sufficient to attack the enemy could enter: then the king in per∣son led on
his men, and the unfortunate garrison devoting them∣selves to death, had
retired to their temples. Akbar perceiving that he must lose a great number
of his troops in case of a close attack, ordered a distant fire to be
kept up upon the desperate <PB N="255" REF="265"/>

became now too shocking to be described. Brave men rendered more valiant by
despair, crouded around the ele∣phants, seized them even by the tusks,
and inflicted upon them unavailing wounds. The terrible animals trode the
Rajaputs like grasshoppers under their feet, or winding them in their
powerful trunks, tossed them aloft into the air, or dashed them against
the walls and pavements. Of the garrison, which con∣sisted of eight
thousand Rajaputs and of forty thousand inhabi∣tants, thirty thousand
were slain, and the most of the rest taken prisoners. A few escaped
in the confusion, by tying their own children like captives, and driving them
through the king's camp. They by this means passed undiscovered, being
taken for some of the followers of the camp.</P>

touch the animal, and riding forward himself, he began to wound him with
arrows. The terrible ani∣mal stood growling on a rising ground near the
king, and being enraged by his wounds, he ran directly towards the king, who
stood to receive him with his lance. One of his attendants called Adil,
fearing the consequence, rushed between Akbar and the tyger, and

against it. He therefore marched to Ajmere under a pretence of a pilgri∣mage,
and from that place detached Chan Callan before him towards Guzerat. The king
followed at some distance with the main body of the army. Akbar in his way
appointed Rai Singh to the government of Joelpoor, the residence of Raja
Maldeo, whom on account of some misdemeanor he deposed. When the emperor
arrived at Nagore, he received advices of the birth of another son, on the 2d

more effectual when the means are used.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Which sub∣mits without a blow.</NOTE>The king
appearing with his army on the confines of Guzerat, Shere Chan Fowladi, an
Omrah of distinction who defended the frontiers, abandoned his post and
fled with precipitation. The king took immediate possession of Pattan,
and gave the government of it to Seid Ahmed Chan. He from that place moved his
standard of victory towards Ahmed-abad; but before he had marched two
stages, Sultan Muziffer came to meet him, and without a blow, sur∣rendered
his kingdom into the hands of Akbar, so that the king entered Ahmed-abad, the
capital of Guzerat, in as peaceable a manner, as if he had been entering Agra.
To account for this it may not be improper to say something concerning the
state of Guzerat at that period.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The state of Guzerat.</NOTE>Sultan Mamood
king of Guzerat, having sometime before this event died, his Omrahs,
particularly Seid Mubarik Actemad Chan, and Amad ul Muluck, who
possessed all the power of the government during the minority of the
prince Sultan Ahmed, the son and successor of Sultan Mamood, finding
him begin to think for himself, were unwilling to part with their power, and
found means privately to make away with him: but to keep up the appearance of
loyalty, they raised a child of doubtful birth to the throne, on whom they
imposed the name of Sultan Mu∣ziffer, and divided the kingdom among
themselves in the fol∣lowing manner. Ahmed-abad, Cambait, and some other
pro∣vinces, were possessed by Actemad Chan; Anduka, Dolukch, and some
other countries, by Juil Chan the grandson of Seid Muba∣rick;

Birod and Japanier, by Chingez Chan the son of Amad ul Muluck, while other
Omrahs who had influ∣ence in the state, had the rest of the kingdom
partitioned among them. The nominal king Sultan Muziffer was in the mean time
cooped up by Actemad Chan in Ahmed-abad; during this oligarchy, the government
became very oppressive, by con∣tinual wars and civil dissentions. This
made the unhappy people of Guzerat turn their eyes towards Akbar, to relieve
them from their petty tyrants, who like vultures, gnawed the bowels of their
country. The easy conquest of Guzerat was therefore no ways surprizing,
as the nominal king tired of his situation, hoped more from the favor of a
foreign prince, than from his own factious and independant Omrahs.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Akbar's trans∣actions in Gu∣zerat.</NOTE>But
to return from this digression. The second day after the king's entrance
into Ahmed-abad, he was waited upon by the principal Omrahs of Guzerat, who
hastened to make their sub∣mission. But Aligh Chan and Hujaz Chan, two
Abyssinian Omrahs, were ordered into confinement, as they gave some
evi∣dent signs of discontent. Ibrahim Hussein Mirza was still at the
head of an army in Biroge, and Mahummud Hussein Mirza at the head of
another considerable force near Surat. The king therefore resolved to
reduce them: Aichtiar ul Muluck one of the Omrahs of Guzerat, having broke his
parole of honor and fled at this time, all the other Omrahs were ordered into
close confinement. When the king arrived at the port of Cambait, he appointed
Chan Azim Mirza Aziz governor of Ahmed-abad.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Exploits of Akbar against Ibrahim
Hus∣sein.</NOTE>Ibrahim Hussein Mirza, who we have already observed
was in Biroge, hearing of Akbar's approach, and suspecting the fidelity of

and discovered an inclination to march into <PB N="261" REF="271"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1572. Higer. 980.</NOTE>Punjab to raise
disturbances in that quarter. The king receiv∣ing intelligence of this
design about midnight, left his camp in charge of Chaja Jehan and Calliche
Chan, and with a chosen detachment marched himself that night with all
expedition to cut off Ibrahim's retreat: the next day he reached the river
Mhenderi, which runs by the town of Sirtal, with only forty horse, the rest
having lagged behind with fatigue. The enemy being encamped on the opposite
bank of the river, and in sight, the king thought it prudent to proceed no
further, till the rest of his detachment should arrive. Had Ibrahim
therefore known any thing of the art of war, he might have easily taken Akbar
prisoner. But that unenterprizing officer made no attempt of that kind, till
the king was joined by a fresh detach∣ment, which had been ordered some
days before to Surat, and happened to be then encamped at a little
distance.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">He attacks 1000 of the enemy with 70

Baherra, Raja Buguan Dass, Raja Man Singh, Shaw Kulli Chan Myram, and Raja
Surjun of Rintimpore. With these the king, without waiting for more troops,
took the des∣perate resolution to attack the enemy, one thousand of whom
commanded by Ibrahim Hussein, waited to receive him, while the main body of
the army pursued their march. It happened very fortunately for Akbar that the
enemy instead of permitting him to come into the plain, opposed him between
two hedges, where not above six horsemen could fight abreast. The king in
this narrow pass put himself upon the footing of a private trooper, and
performed extraordinary seats of personal valour: which however avail
little to wipe away the folly of this piece of his conduct.

Hussein fled to his army, but such was their conster∣nation and opinion
of Akbar's prowess, that the greatest part of his forces deserted him,
which was all the advantage that could be gained by such a victory. The king
contenting himself with what he had done, desisted from the pursuit,
and waiting till his army came up, marched and invested Surat. In the mean
time the Omrahs of Guzerat collected themselves in the environs of Pattan,
and held a council how to proceed. They agreed that Ibrahim Hussein Mirza
should prosecute his scheme of rais∣ing disturbances in Punjab, and
that Mahummud Hussein Mirza, Shaw Mirza, and Shere Chan Fowladi, should
invest Pattan. They expected by these means to draw the king from the
siege of Surat.</P>

governor of Jodpoor, who had pursued him, came up with him one day towards
the evening, at a place where there was no water to be found, but what Ibrahim
possessed. This made the troops of Rai Singh, who were in great
distress for water, call out to attack the enemy. This favorable
disposition and the neces∣sity of the attempt, made Rai Singh, though
much inferior to the enemy, join battle. Ibrahim's horse being killed, and he
himself dismounted in the first charge, his army imagining that he was
actually slain, gave ground. The enemy took such advan∣tage of their
confusion, that the whole efforts of Ibrahim were not capable to recover the
disorder, and he was totally routed: he fled with great precipitation towards
Delhi, and from thence to Simbol.</P>

out to meet him, and gave him battle. Aziz Koka had at first the
disadvantage, both his wings being thrown into disorder, but his troops

formerly made. Daood being threatened at the time with a civil war by one Lodi,
who discovered an inclination to usurp the kingdom, consented upon
Jodermul's appearance to pay the tribute de∣manded. He then found means to
seize upon Lodi, whom he put to death. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">He is over∣thrown.</NOTE>Daood relieved from
that domestic danger, broke the treaty with the king, and advancing against
Chan Chanan and Raja Jodermul, engaged them at the confluence of the Sool, Gang
and Sirve, where being defeated, he lost his fleet of boats and all his
baggage. Chan Chanan crossed immediately the river, and laid siege to
Patna.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The king sets out for Bengal.</NOTE>The king
informed of these transactions, set out from Agra in the middle of the
rains, with as many troops as could be con∣tained in a thousand boats: he
halted a few days at Benaris, where he was joined by the forces which marched
overland: he immediately embarked the whole, and fell down to Patna, and on his
way he received the news of the reduction of Becker by Jesu Chan, who had
been sent against that place. Akbar having arrived within a few miles of
Patna, heard that Isah Chan Neazi, one of the enemies principal generals, had
marched out of the fort and fought Chan Chanan, but that he was defeated and
lost his life, so that the place was upon the point of being evacuated. The
king therefore sent Chan Allum with three thousand horse, to
possess himself of the fort of Hadgeepoor, on the opposite bank of
the river, and to endeavour to harrass the enemy in their retreat, should
they be already gone, if not, to stop them. Chan Allum accordingly took that
place by assault, and made Fatte Chan the governor, and the garrison
prisoners: Daood intimi∣dated <PB N="269" REF="279"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1574. Higer. 982.</NOTE>by this, sent a
herald to the king to beg terms of accom∣modation.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The king challenges the Suba of Ben∣gal to a
single combat.</NOTE>The king returned him for answer, that he granted him
his life, but that he must trust every thing else to his clemency, after
making his submission; but if he should be obstinate enough to hold
out some few days merely to give him trouble, he could have no reason to
hope for pardon; 
<Q REND="inline">"and though, said the king, I have a thousand
in my army as good men as you, rather than fatigue my troops with a siege, I
will put the whole upon the issue of a single combat between you and me,
and let him take the fort who shall best deserve it."</Q> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Who declines and flies.</NOTE>Daood did not
chuse to accept the challenge, nor even to put him to farther trouble, but
took boat at the water-gate that night, and fled down the river: soon after
all his army evacuated the place. The next morning the king pursued them and
took four hundred ele∣phants, and the greatest part of their baggage. He then
returned to Patna, conferred the government of that place and its depen∣dencies
upon Chan Chanan, then returned without pursuing his conquest farther to
Agra.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Transactions at Agra.</NOTE>Chan Azim from
Guzerat and Chan Jehan from Lahore, came to pay their respects to the king,
and returned afterwards to their respective governments. Akbar at the same
time conferred the title of Muziffer Chan upon Chaja Muziffer Alli, and
appointed him to command a force against the fort of Rhotas in Behar: he
himself made a tour to Ajmere, where having bestowed great charities, he
returned to Agra.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The war in Bengal, and the reduction of that

further into Bengal against Daood. That general having forced the pass of
Killagurry, Daood fled into Orissa, whither he was <PB N="270" REF="280"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1575. Higer. 983.</NOTE>pursued by Raja
Jodermul, with part of the king's army. Junied the son of Daood defeated
Jodermul in two battles, which obliged Chan Chanan to march to his aid: both
the Mogul generals having joined their forces, engaged Daood.</P>
<P>Kudgera, an Afghan chief of great bravery, who commanded Daood's
vanguard, attacked the vanguard of Chan Chanan com∣manded by Chan Allum, and
defeated and killed that Omrah. The Afgan pursued the run-aways through the
center of their own army, which were by that time drawn up in order of battle.
Chan Chanan observing the disorder hastened himself with a small body
to renew the ranks, Kudgera attacked him in person, and wounded him in
several places, so that he was obliged to quit the field, and he was soon
followed by his army. The valiant Kudgera being killed by an arrow, Chan Chanan
rallied his troops, and being a little recovered, led them back to the charge:
he found Daood's army intent upon the plunder, and soon put them to flight,
taking all their elephants.</P>
<P>Raja Jodermul being detached to pursue the enemy, came up with
Daood on the banks of the Chin, which he could not cross. The rebel finding
no means for escaping, faced about to defend himself. Raja Jodermul did not
chuse to provoke Daood too far, and immediately sent intelligence of what
had passed to Chan Chanan. That Omrah, notwithstanding his wounds which
were very bad, hasted to that place: Daood surrendered himself upon
terms, and was permitted to retain Orissa, after which Chan Chanan
returned. The city of Gore, which had been the capital of Bengal till the time
of Shere, who on account of the badness of the air, had made Chawasspoor
Tanda, the me∣tropolis, was now greatly decayed. Chan Chanan admiring the
antiquity and grandeur of that place, gave orders to repair the 
<PB N="271" REF="281"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1575. Higer. 983.</NOTE>palaces, and made
it his residence: but he soon fell a victim to the unhealthy air of Gore
and died. He was succeeded in his government by Hussein Kulli Chan
Turkuman, to whom the king gave the title of Chan Jehan.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Transactions at court.</NOTE>Mirza Soliman
prince of Buduchshan, being expelled by his own grandson Mirza Shaw, was
about this time obliged to seek protection at the court of Agra. He soon
after took leave of the king, to go on a pilgrimage to Mecca, after which he
returned to Buduchshan, and found means to reinstate himself in his
domi∣nions. Some Omrahs at court who envied the greatness of Mirza Aziz Koka,
viceroy of Guzerat, accused him to the king of trea∣sonable intentions:
they so far prevailed upon him, that he recalled him from his government and
confined him. Koka's readiness to comply with the imperial order, convinced
Akbar that he was no ways guilty; but that the whole proceeded from the malice
of his enemies: however, Shab ul Dein Ahmed Chan Neishapuri, who was advanced
to the government of Guzerat, had sufficient inte∣rest at court to retain
his office after his predecessor was acquitted.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rebellion in Bengal.</NOTE>Before Chan Jehan
had taken possession of his government of Bengal and Behar, the
Zemindars of those provinces had risen in favour of Daood, and invested
Chawasspoor, which they took. Daood found himself soon at the head of
fifty thousand horse, and in possession of the greatest part of
those countries. Chan Jehan having assembled all the Imperial Omrahs in
that quarter, advanced against Daood, and that chief retreated beyond the
passes, which Chan Jehan forced, and killed above a thousand of the
enemy, who attempted to stop his march. The enemy on account of the
narrowness of the defile, had not time to escape. Chan Jehan immediately
marched towards Daood's camp, and on the 15th of Shawal 983, drew up his army
in order of battle <PB N="272" REF="282"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1575. Higer. 983.</NOTE>near to the enemy,
who stood ready to receive him. Callapar, an Omrah famous in the army of
Daood for personal strength and valor, made a resolute charge upon the
left of the imperial line, and threw it into disorder; while Muziffer Chan,
who commanded the right of Chan Jehan's army, had the same ad∣vantage over
the enemy on the left; in this situation they fought in a circle, when Chan
Jehan made a home charge upon the center of the enemy, which was sustained
with great bravery. At length however the gale of victory blew on the imperial
standards, and the enemy were dispersed like leaves before the autumnal
wind. Daood being taken prisoner, was according to the barba∣rous custom of
war when the king was not present, put to death by the conqueror in cold
blood upon the field: his son Juneid, a youth of great bravery, died in a few
days of his wounds. Chan Jehan took immedate possession of all Bengal,
and sent all the elephants and other spoils to the king.</P>
<P>Muziffer Chan in the year 984, set out against Rhotas, and
sent Mahummud Masoom to expel Hussein Chan, an Afghan, who was hovering
about with a flying party in that quarter. Masoom Chan having engaged him,
defeated him and took pos∣session of his Pergunnahs; but Callapar in
the mean time with eight thousand horse, surrounded him and thought to
have obliged him to surrender. Masoom Chan breaking down the wall of the
town in which he was shut up, rushed out unex∣pectedly upon the enemy. In
the action which ensued Masoom Chan's horse was killed by a stroke of
the trunk of the elephant. Callapar immediately rode up and he himself was in
the most imminent danger of being crushed to death, had he not wounded the
elephant with an arrow in the eye, which rendered the ani∣mal so unruly, that
he would obey no command: he therefore rushed back through the Afgan troops,
carrying off Callapar, <PB N="273" REF="283"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1576. Higer. 984.</NOTE>which made his
army believe that he fled, and they quickly followed him. Callapar was soon
overtaken and slain.</P>
<P>Masoom after this victory returned and joined Muziffer Chan, who
left Shabass Chan Cumbo to blockade the fort of Rhotas, and marched against
Raja Chander Sein, from whom he took the fort of Savana. From thence he
directed his march against Raja Gudgeputti, from whom he took the fort of
Keregur, situated in the woods between Behar and Bengal.</P>
<P>The Afghans in the fort of Rhotas being destitute of
provi∣sions, were prevailed upon by promises and a favorable capitu∣lation
to give up the place: Shabass Chan left Rhotas under the command of his
brother, and went himself to court.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The king makes a pro∣gress through his
dominions.</NOTE>The king this year made a progress towards Ajmere, and
sent Shabass Chan against Comilmere, a strong fortress in the
pos∣session of the Rana; he took the place, and in the mean time the
king made a tour towards the borders of the Decan: Murtaza Nizam Shaw prince of
Ahmednagur, was at that time become melancholy mad and confined to his
apartments: Akbar thought this a proper opportunity to seize upon that
country; but he was diverted from his purpose by some domestic affairs
which occurred at that time, and he returned towards Agra by the way of Ajmere,
where he appointed Muziffer Chan to the high office of the Vizarit. From Ajmere
the Sultan marched to Delhi, and from thence he took the rout of Cabul. When he
was upon his way, a comet of an extraordinary magnitude appeared in the west.
The king having reached Adjodin, visited the tomb of Sheck Ferid
Shuckergunge, and quitting his resolution of going to Cabul, returned to
Agra.</P>

same year imprisoned Muziffer Hussein Mirza by the king's commands, and
sent him to Agra. In the course of the same year Chan Jehan died in
Bengal. In 987 a great fire happened in Fattepoor in the wardrobe, which
consumed effects to a prodigious amount. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Disturbances in Bengal.</NOTE>After the death

Omrah of Punjab, and routed. When Mirza Mahummud Hakim had reached Rhotas in
Punjab, Man Singh retreated to Lahore, whither he was pur∣sued by the prince.

upon the Nilab, which he called Attock, which means in the Indian language
Forbidden; for by the superstition of the Hindoos, it was held unlawful to
cross that river. The king having arrived at Lahore upon the 19th of Ramzan,

<HEAD>SECTION VI. The History of the Reign of AKBAR, from the Year
989, to the Rebellion in Cashmire, in the 1000th of the Higerah.</HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1581. Higer. 989.</NOTE><NOTE PLACE="marg">The king re∣inforces his ar∣my in Bengal.</NOTE>THE troubles in
Bengal still continuing, the king sent Sha∣bass Chan Cumbo, with a
considerable force to reinforce his army in those parts. In the year 991 he
made a progress to Priag, where he ordered the fort of Allahabad to be built
at the confluence of the Jumna and Ganges.</P>
<P>Sultan Muziffer of Guzerat, who had been kept a prisoner at
large since the reduction of his kingdom, began now to exhibit great loyalty
and affection for the king. Akbar upon this ac∣count rewarded him with a large
Jagier, and he became a great favourite at court.</P>
<P>But indulgences of this sort could not gratify the ambition of
the conquered king: he made his escape to Guzerat, while Akbar was at
Allahabad, and by the assistance of Shere Chan stirred up a rebellion
in that kingdom. The king upon the first intelligence of this insurrection,
sent Actemad Chan in qua∣lity of governor to Guzerat, and recalled Shab ul
Dien, who was suspected of favouring Sultan Muziffer. After the arrival of
the new governor, Shab ul Dien came out of Ahmed-abad, and halted some days
at Pattan to prepare for his journey, during which time a great part of his
army deserted to Sultan Muziffer. This enabled that prince to march towards
Ahmed-abad.</P>
<P> <PB N="277" REF="287"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1582. Higer. 990.</NOTE>Actemad Chan the
governor left an officer and part of his troops to defend the city, and with
the rest marched out to Pattan, where Shab ul Dien was encamped. Sultan
Muziffer in the mean time, with very little opposition, possessed
himself of Ahmed-abad. The new governor then prevailed upon Shab ul Dien to
accompany him, and marched back to retake the place. Sultan Muziffer who came
out to battle, defeated the two gover∣nors, and drove them back to Pattan.
Actemad sent an express from Pattan, to acquaint the king of his
misfortune.</P>
<P>Akbar being informed of the untoward situation of affairs in
Guzerat, dispatched Abdul Rustum, commonly called Mirza Chan, the son of
the great minister Byram Chan, together with the Omrahs of Ajmere, to
restore the tranquility of that pro∣vince; but before Mirza Chan had reached
Guzerat, Sultan Muziffer had reduced the fort of Biruderra, which was defended
by Cuttub ul Dien Mahummud, Jagierdar of Beroche, and had there taken fourteen
lacks of rupees belonging to the king, and ten crores of rupees of the property
of the governor, who lost his life on the occasion. This immense
acquisition of treasure enabled him to recruit a great army at Ahmed-abad,
whither Mirza Chan marched to attack him with eight thousand horse.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mirza Chan engages and defeats Sultan

out to meet him with thirty thousand horse, and drew up in his presence.
The Imperial general noways intimidated by his numbers, encouraged his men,
charged the enemy vigorously sword in hand, defeated them with great
slaughter, and pursued them quite through the city. Being soon after
joined by the Omrahs of Malava with a considerable force, he marched after
Sultan Muziffer towards Combait, and drove <PB N="278" REF="288"/>

mountains of Nadout. Muziffer faced about to oppose the Moguls in a narrow
defile, but he was driven from his post by the artillery of Mirza Chan, and
fled towards Jionagur, taking refuge with Jame, a Raja of these parts.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mirza reduces Guzerat.</NOTE>Mirza Chan
thinking it unnecessary to pursue Muziffer further, returned to
Ahmed-abad, and sent Callehi Chan to besiege the fort of Baroche, which he
took from Nasire Chan, the brother-in-law of Sultan Muziffer. Nasire held
out the place seven months, and at last made his escape to the Decan.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Muziffer makes several attempts upon

sudden pannic, and made a precipitate retreat: but strengthened by new

two months at Cabul viewing the gardens of pleasure, and distributing
justice and charity among the inha∣bitants, conferred the government upon
Mahummud Casim Chan, and on the 20th of Mohirrim 998, returned towards

of Ribbi ul Sani 1004: they employed themselves in carrying on approaches,
raising mounts, erecting batteries, and sinking mines; while Chand Bibi
defended the place with a manly resolution, and wrote to Adil Shaw for

himself in the center to receive him: Raja Alli Chan and Raja Ram Chund being
at the head of a body of Herawils in his front, to begin the attack. The charge
was made with such intrepidity on the side of the Moguls, that they broke
through the Herawils of the enemy, and fell upon Joheil Chan. They were however
repulsed by a heavy discharge of artillery, small arms and rockets, which
did great execution particularly among the Rajaputs and the troops of Chandez,
who advanced under Raja Alli Chan and Raja Ram Chund. Both those chiefs were
killed, with above three thousand of their horse. The center being broke,
the Usbecks and Moguls on the left wing gave way also, and Joheil Chan
remained master of the field on that side: but Chan Chanan, who had
shifted his post to the right during the action, had made an impression
there, and was pursuing the enemy, without knowing what had happened on the
left. Night in the mean time coming on, and Joheil Chan equally ignorant of
what had happened on his left, thought he had gained a complete victory: he
however contented him∣self, as it was now dark, with keeping
possession of the field, and permitted his troops to plunder the
baggage. To secure their plunder, half of his army deserted to lodge their
spoils in places of security. Joheil Chan with the remainder sat in the
dark, without knowing whither to proceed.</P>
<P>Chan Chanan in the mean time returning from the pursuit, fell in
with Joheil Chan's artillery, within a small distance of that General, and
thinking the enemy entirely routed, de∣termined to remain there till morning

themselves defeated, had fled full speed to Shapoor. While things were in
this perplexing situation, Joheil Chan's troops began to light up fires and
flambeaus where they stood, having heard that Chan Chanan was near. The Mogul
General being informed also by his spies, that the enemy was in his
neighbourhood, he ordered some pieces of artillery to be loaded and fired
among them, which threw them into great confusion. Joheil Chan immediately
ordered all the fires to be extinguished, and shifting his ground, sent
scouts all round to collect such of his troops as were dispersed over
the plain and in the adjacent villages.</P>
<P>In the mean time Chan Chanan blew his trumpets and beat to arms,
according to his manner, which being heard by such of his troops as were
dispersed over the field, they hastened towards him in small
detachments. Several of the Moguls meeting with others of the enemy in the
dark, they fought and formed such a scene of horror and confusion, as is
not easy to be described; while Allah! Allah! resounded from all sides,
and every eye was fixed upon the east in expectation of the dawn. When the
day exalted his beams, Joheil Chan was seen marching towards the Moguls with
twelve thousand horse. Though the army of Chan Chanan did not exceed four
thousand, he determined once more to dispute the field, and formed his line
to oppose the enemy. The battle now joined with redoubled fury on both
sides, but Joheil Chan after exhibiting the most daring acts of valor,
sunk at last under fatigue and wounds, and fell from his horse. A body of
his dependants bore him instantly off: his army according to custom
followed him, and left Chan Chanar master of a bloody field. Chan Chanan in
no condition to pur∣sue the run-a-ways, returned to Shapoor, to join the

of the Decan. Ahmednagur was taken in the beginning of the year 1009: the
strong fortress of Asere, some months after, was surrendered to the

The king reduced Asere, Birhanpoor, Ahmednagur, and Berar, into the form of a
province, and conferred the government upon Da∣nial, under the tuition and

in a declining state of health, that he every day became worse, 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Akbar dies.</NOTE>till upon the 13th of Jemmad

much lustre, after having reigned fifty-one years, and some months.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">His character.</NOTE>Mahummud Akbar was a
prince endued with many shining virtues. His generosity was great, and his
clemency without bounds: this latter virtue he often carried beyond the bounds
of prudence, and in many instances past the limits of that justice which
he owed to the state; but his daring spirit made this noble error seem to
proceed from a generous disposition, and not from an effeminate weakness
of mind.</P>
<P>His character as a warrior was rather that of an intrepid
par∣tizan, than of a great general: he exposed his person with unpardonable
rashness, and often attempted capital points with∣out using that power
which at the time he possessed.—But fortune and a daring soul
supplied the place of conduct in Ak∣bar: he brought about at once by
desperate means, what calm caution would take much time to accomplish. This
circum∣stance spread the terror of the name of this son of true glory
so wide, that Hindostan, ever subject to the convulsions of rebel∣lion,
became settled and calm in his presence. He raised a wall 
<PB N="298" REF="308"/> of disciplined valor<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Soldiers.</NOTE> against the powers of the north, and by his own
activity inspired his Omrahs with enterprize.</P>
<P>He loved glory to excess, and thirsted after a reputation for
personal valor: he encouraged learning with the bounty of kings, and
delighted in history, which is in truth the school of sovereigns. As his
warm and active disposition prompted him to perform actions worthy of the
divine pen of the poet, so he was particularly fond of heroic compositions

extremes; and if he sometimes did things beneath the dignity of a great king,
he never did any thing unworthy of a good man.</P>

<HEAD>HISTORY OF THE MOGUL EMPIRE, FROM Its decline, in the Reign of
MAHUMMUD SHAW, to the Present Times.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECTION I. General Observations.—The Succession,
from AKBAR to MAHUMMUD SHAW. The growing Imbecillity of the
Empire.—Governors of the Provinces assume Inde∣pendence. Their
Intrigues at the Court of Delhi.—The Invasion of NADIR SHAW.</HEAD>
<P>MAHUMMUD CASIM FERISHTA, the author of the preceding history,
finishes his account of the kings of Delhi with the death of Akbar. The
trans∣lator is still in hopes of being able to procure original and
au∣thentic histories of the empire of Hindostan, from that period down to
the present times. He, therefore, will not break in <PB N="2" REF="310"/> upon
his design of giving, some time or other, to the public, a complete
history of the reigns of the posterity of Timur in India, by retailing the
very imperfect accounts already published in Europe.</P>
<P>But as, to translate from the Persian language is a task
of labor and difficulty, his engaging further, in works of this kind, will
depend entirely upon the reception the public shall give to his first
attempt in that way. If he shall find that he is not capable to acquit
himself, in some degree, to the satisfaction of the world, he will, in
prudence, lay down his pen; and leave that field to men of greater abilities,
who may hereafter turn their thoughts to the subject.</P>
<P>The transactions of the court of Delhi, since the invasion
of Nadir Shaw, are very little known in the West. They have not, even in
Asia, been hitherto committed to writing; and if the present confusions
of the Mogul empire shall long continue, it is probable the memory of them
will die with those who were principally concerned in them. This
consideration has induced the translator of Ferishta's history, to
throw together the most material events, which happened in the empire,
since the memo∣rable irruption of the Persians, in the year 1738. He
derives his authority, for some of the facts, from a Persian manuscript,
now in his hands, concerning six years of the reign of Mahummud Shaw; and as
to the rest, he principally follows a short sketch of the affairs of the
empire, given to him in writing, by his intimate friend the Rai Raiân,
secretary of state to the present mogul.</P>
<P>To continue the line of connection, between the preceding
history and the reign of Mahummud Shaw, who sat upon the throne of Delhi
when the invasion of Nadir Shaw happened, it may not be improper, just to
mention the succession of the kings, <PB N="3" REF="311"/> from Akbar to
that period. It is necessary to observe, that, after consulting the
most authentic Persian histories, the author of this account finds
himself obliged to differ from all the European writers, who have treated on
the subject, with regard to the du∣ration of most of the reigns.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1605</NOTE>Upon the death of Akbar, his
son Selim ascended the throne, in Agra, upon Thursday the 20th of Jemmad
ul Sani, in the 1014 year of the Higera. He, upon his accession,
assumed the title of JEHANGIRE, and reigned twenty-two years, nine months,
and twenty days, with much more reputation and success than could have been
expected of so weak a prince. His death hap∣pened upon Sunday the 28th of
Siffer, in the 1037 year of the Higera.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">1627</NOTE>SULTAN KURRUM, the third son of
Jehangire, mounted the throne at Agra, upon the 8th of Jemmad ul Sani, in the
year 1037, and, under the title of SHAW JEHAN, reigned thirty-two years, three
months, and twenty days. He was deposed by his third son, the famous
Aurungzebe, who dated the commence∣ment of his reign, from the first of
Ramzan, in the 1069 of the Higera. Aurungzebe, upon his accession, took the
name of Allumgire<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Though Shaw Jehan was confined during
the time his four rebellious sons, Dara Shekoh, Sultan Suja, Aurungzebe, and
Morad Buksh, contended for the crown, yet as Aurungzebe prevailed over his
brothers, and dated his reign from the year 1069, we have included the time of
the civil wars in the reign of his father.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">1648</NOTE>ALLUMGIRE, having reigned fifty
years, two months, and twenty-eight days, died, in a very advanced age, at

<P> <PB N="4" REF="312"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">1707</NOTE>Mahummud Mauzim, Aurungzebe's
second son, succeeded his father in the throne, under the title of
BAHADAR SHAW. He died, after a short reign of four years and eleven months,
and was succeeded by his eldest son, Moaz ul Dien.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">1712</NOTE>Moaz ul Dien, under the title of
JEHANDAR SHAW, reigned eighteen months. Some writers do not include him in the
suc∣cession of kings, as the succeeding emperor, the son of Azim ul

dated his reign from the death of his grandfather.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">1713</NOTE>FIRROCHSERE, according to his own
computation, reigned six years. He was blinded, and afterwards put to death,
by the two SEIDS, upon the 12th of Jammad ul Sani, in the 1130 of the
Higera.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">1717</NOTE>RAFFEIH UL DIRJAT, the son of
Raffeih ul Shaw, the third son of Bahadar Shaw, was raised to the throne,
by the ambitious Seids; and after a nominal reign of three months, was put to
death by the same faction, by whose interest he had obtained the
crown.—His brother RAFFEIH UL DOWLAT succeeded him; but he died in a
few days.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">1718</NOTE>MAHUMMUD SHAW, the son of Jehan
Shaw, and grandson of Bahadar Shaw, acceded to the throne of Delhi, in the
month of Shawal of the year 1130 of the Higera.—Mahummud Shaw, having rid
himself of the two Seids, Abdalla Chan, and Hassen Chan, who had so
long tyrannized in the empire, raising and de∣posing kings at pleasure,
gave himself wholly up to indolence, and the enervating pleasures of the
Haram. The distractions, before Mahummud's accession, occasioned
principally by the ambition of the Seids, gave the first mortal wound to the
Mogul empire, under which it has ever since languished. Most of the
Omrahs, <PB N="5" REF="313"/> either envying or dreading the power of the Seids,
formed ambitious schemes of independence in their respective provinces,
which the aparent debility of the regal authority very much favored.</P>
<P>Cuttulich Chan, who, as Nizam ul muluck, commanded all the
provinces of the Decan, being sensible of the weakness of Mahummud,
maintained a great standing army, under a pretence of keeping the unsubdued
Hindoo Rajas and Mahrattor<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">These are they, who are
known in Europe, under the disfigured name of Marattoes.</NOTE> chiefs in awe.
But the real design of this force was to found an inde∣pendent kingdom for
the Nizam in the Decan, as Hassen Caco Bemeni had done in the reign of
Tuglick Shaw<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">This Hassen Caco mounted the
throne at Kilbirga in the Decan, which city
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e called from himself,
Hassen-abad, upon the 24th of Ribbi ul Achir, in the
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>48 of the Higera. He assumed
the title of sultan Alla ul Dien.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>To facilitate his ambitious views, the Nizam ul muluck began to
extend his power in the Decan, by the reduction of the neighbouring Rajas.
Though the revenues of his government must have been very considerably
increased by these conquests, he remitted none to the Delhi; and, at the
same time, to weaken the empire, he encouraged, or at least, permitted the
Mahrattors to make hostile incursions into the interior provinces. These
ir∣regular marauders ravaged the kingdoms of Malava, Narvar, Biana and Ajmere,
in such a manner, that no revenues could be paid by the unfortunate
inhabitants.</P>
<P>The weak Mahummud, instead of checking this insolence by the
sword, disgraced the dignity of the house of Timur, by submitting to
become, in a manner, tributary to these despicable banditti. He agreed to
pay them the Chout, or fourth part of the revenues of those provinces, which
had been subject to their <PB N="6" REF="314"/> depredations. From this
pusillanimous conduct of Mahummud, we may date the irretrievable decline of
the Mogul empire. That opinion, which supports government in every country,
was now destroyed in India; and each petty chieftain began to start into a
prince, as he had nothing to fear from a government which had betrayed such
evident symptoms of timidity.</P>
<P>Chan Dowran Sumsam ul Dowla was, at this time, Amir ul Omrah,
or captain-general of the empire. As the offices of paymaster-general and
commander in chief of the troops are injudiciously joined in one person, in
Hindostan, Chan Dowran had such an influence in the state, that he
engrossed to himself all the ministerial power. He left, in short,
nothing but their names in the government to the king and his vizier, Kimmir ul
Dien Chan.</P>
<P>Chan Dowran was sly, artful, insinuating; of an active and
intriguing disposition; in appearance assuming no authority, when, at
the same time, he directed every thing. He executed, in public, as by the
king's orders, whatever he himself had resolved upon in private. As the
indolent Mahummud was even averse to the trouble of thinking, the
suggestions of this artful Omrah, who was full of plausibility, and
prompt to execute whatever he advised, were always grateful to the royal ear.
The captain-general, though personally brave, permitted his master's
authority to be daily insulted by despicable enemies. He foresaw that to
take the field, without the king, would probably put an end to his influence
over him; for he knew that the disposition of Mahummud was sickle and
inconstant; and apt to be swayed to any thing, by every artful person
near him.</P>
<P>Dowran made many unsuccessful attempts to persuade
Ma∣hummud to accompany him to the field. The dissolute monarch was not to
be removed from the luxurious indolence of the <PB N="7" REF="315"/> palace. The
Mahrattors, in the mean time, continued their inroads. They ravaged the
province of Guzerat, and raised the Chout as far as the Indus. They returned
back from that river, by the way of Ajmere and Biana, and spread their
devasta∣tions to the very gates of Agra.</P>
<P>The captain-general, though much against his inclination,
found himself obliged to march against these plunderers. But, instead
of chastising them, he ingloriously promised to pay them the Chout,
upon condition they should immediately evacuate the provinces.</P>
<P>The barbarians, gaining courage by this submission, and
trust∣ing very little to promises extorted by fear, from Dowran,
crossed the Jumna, near Calpee, with a design to plunder the province of
Oud. Sadit Chan, who then possessed that subaship, opposed them,
between the rivers in the district of Korah, and gave them a total defeat.
They fled to Feridabad near Delhi, whither they were closely pursued by
Sadit, who had, on his way, joined the imperial army under Dowran.</P>
<P>Before the united armies under Dowran and Sadit came up, the
Mahrattors made an attempt to plunder Delhi. They were opposed, without the
walls, by two imperial Omrahs, Hassen Chan and Amir Chan, the former of
whom was killed in the action. The Mahrattors had now possessed
themselves of the suburbs, when Kimmir the vizier, coming up with an army,
put them to flight. But notwithstanding these repeated defeats, the
Mahrattors found means to retreat, with a great booty to the Decan.</P>
<P>The king and his ministers, finding that the Nizam of the
Decan favored the incursions of the Mahrattors, devised many 
<PB N="8" REF="316"/> schemes to inveigle him to court, that they might
deprive him either of his life or government. The crafty Nizam, pene∣trating
into their designs, conceived an implacable resentment against Chan
Dowran, who, he knew, was at the bottom of the whole affair. But as the empire,
notwithstanding its grow∣ing imbecillity, was still sufficiently strong
to reduce the Nizam, had he broke forth in open rebellion, he thought it most
prudent to obey the royal command. He, however, previously, strength∣ened
his interest at court, by a coalition with many great Omrahs, who were
disgusted with the insolence of Dowran.</P>
<P>Cuttulich Chan, having taken a step so necessary for his
own safety, set out for court, leaving his son Ghazi ul Dien in the
govern∣ment of the Decan. He arrived at Agra, with a retinue, or rather an army
of 20000 men; and, as he held the office of Vakeel Muttuluch<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">For the nature of this office see the preface.</NOTE>, he
expected to command Chan Dowran, and to draw all the reins of government into
his own hands.</P>
<P>Sadit Chan, Suba of Oud, pluming himself upon his success
against the Mahrattors, aspired to the ministerial power. The king
continued to favor Dowran, and to support him against the Nizam; for,
however weak Mahummud was, he could not but see through that ambitious
governor's designs, by his behavior for some years back. But, as the Nizam
had, upon the spot, a force to protect his person, and a strong party at
court; and as his son, a man of great parts, commanded all the provinces of
the Decan, the king was assured, that to deprive Cuttulich Chan of his
government, would occasion a revolt, which, in its conse∣quences, might
prove fatal to the royal house of Timur.</P>
<P>In the mean time, Sadit Chan, finding that he could not effect
any thing against the united interests of the Nizam and vizier, 
<PB N="9" REF="317"/> who had joined factions, was easily brought over to
their party. The terms of this coalition were, that when the Nizam and Vizier
should force themselves into the management of the affairs of government,
Sadit Chan should be appointed buckshi<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Paymaster-general of the forces.</NOTE>, with the title of Amir
ul omrah, which Dowran at that time possessed.</P>
<P>The accession of Sadit and his party did not render the
faction of the Nizam and Vizier sufficiently strong to turn Dowran from his
high employ. He had absolute possession of the royal ear, and the
army, who depended upon him for their pay, remained firm to his interest. The
faction of the malcontents was reduced to despair; and Nizam ul muluck, to
gratify his resentment against Dowran, concerted, with Sadit, a plan, which
gave the last stroke to the tottering authority of the crown.</P>
<P>The famous Nadir Shaw, king of Persia, was, at this juncture,
in the province of Candahar. The disaffected Omrahs resolved to invite him
to Hindostan. They foresaw that a Persian invasion would occasion
confusions and distractions in the empire, which must facilitate their
own schemes of independence in their respective governments; it must, at
any rate, ruin Chan Dowran, which was a very capital object to men
possessed of such inveterate animosities against that
minister.</P>
<P>Whether the Nizam did not even extend his views to the empire
itself, admits of some doubt. Many sensible men in India think that he
did; and affirm, that his opinion was, that Nadir Shaw would depose Mahummud;
and, to secure his conquest, extirpate the family of Timur: he argued with
himself, that as it was not probable that the Persian would fix his
residence in Hin∣dostan, he hoped, for his services, to secure to
himself the vice∣royship <PB N="10" REF="318"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1738.</NOTE>of that empire; and that
afterwards time and circum∣stances would point out the line of his future
proceedings.</P>
<P>Full of these ambitious projects, and at the same time to
avenge himself of his political enemy, the Nizam, in conjunction with Sadit,
wrote to Nadir Shaw. That monarch received their letters at Candahar, and, in
an answer to them, pointed out many difficulties which he had to surmount
in the pro∣posed invasion. He represented to them, that it would be
extremely difficult to penetrate even into Cabul and Peshawir, which
provinces Nasir Chan had governed for twenty years, with great reputation,
and kept in pay a formidable army of Moguls and Afgans: that should he even
force his way through the government of Nasir, there were five great rivers
to cross in Punjâb, where Zekirriah Chan, subadâr of Lahore,
would cer∣tainly oppose him; and that even should he get over those
ob∣stacles, the imperial army still remained to be defeated.</P>
<P>Nizam ul muluck, and his colleague in treason, endeavoured to
remove the king's objections, by assuring him, that they would bring over
the governors of the frontier provinces to their faction; and that, as they
themselves commanded one half of the imperial army, little danger was to be
dreaded from the other. Nadir Shaw began his march from Candahar, with a great
army, 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">March.</NOTE>about the vernal equinox of the
1149 of the Higera. He took the rout of Ghizni, and the governor of that city
came out with presents, and submitted himself and the province to the
king, agreeing to pay the usual revenues to Persia. Nadir Shaw continued
his march from Ghizni to Cabul, which city he im∣mediately invested. Shirza
Chan, an omra of seventy years of age, was, at this time, governor of Cabul.
Being summoned, <PB N="11" REF="319"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1738.</NOTE>he refused to surrender,
and made the proper dispositions for an obstinate defence.</P>
<P>The king of Persia finding that neither fair promises nor
threats could induce Shirza to open the gates of Cabul, assaulted the place
for six days together. In this desperate manner, many of the bravest
soldiers, who suffer most upon these occasions, fell; without making
any impression on the besieged: upon the seventh day, Nadir Shaw found
means to bring over to his party Nasir Chan, governor of the province of
Cabul, the son of that Nasir, who was, for twenty years, subadâr of
Peshawir. That traitor, with the provincial army, presented himself at
that gate of the city which was opposite to the side of the attack, and
sent a letter to the gallant Shirza. He requested immediate admittance to
the place, to prevent his being cut off by the enemy; insinuating, that his
forces, when joined with the gar∣rison, would be a match for the Persians
in the field.</P>
<P>The unfortunate Shirza, not suspecting the treachery of the
young Omrah, consented to receive within the walls the women and baggage of
the provincial army; but insisted that the troops should encamp before
the gate, till they should consult together what was best to be done upon
this urgent occasion.</P>
<P>The women and baggage were accordingly admitted, with a proper
guard, and Shirza, with a few attendants, went out to have an interview with
Nasir. No sooner was Shirza out of the city, than the king of Persia
began a general assault; while one Abdul Rahim, an officer of the traitor
Nasir, seized upon Shirza, and confined him.</P>
<P> <PB N="12" REF="320"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1738.</NOTE>The two sons of Shirza,
ignorant of their father's fate, in the mean time defended the gates with great
firmness and resolution; till one of them was killed by that part of
Nasir's army that had been admitted into the city. The remaining brother, in
this desperate situation, knew not which enemy he ought to oppose, while
the garrison, struck with terror and confusion, deserted their posts
upon the wall. Nadir Shaw took advantage of this panick, forced open the gates,
took the place, massacred many of the inhabitants, and inhumanly put to
death the gallant Shirza Chan and his son.</P>
<P>The king of Persia found in the treasury of Cabul two crores
of roupees, and effects to the value of two crores more: in these were
included four thousand complete suits of armour, in∣laid with gold; four
thousand of polished steel, four thousand mails for horses, and a
great quantity of fine tissues and dresses, deposited in Cabul by
Shaw Jehan. Nadir Shaw remained at Cabul seven months, before he would
attempt to cross the Indus. He, in the mean time, kept up a correspondence
with the con∣spirators in Delhi, and maturely settled his plan of
operations. He, at length, put his army in motion, and directed his march to
Pishawir.</P>
<P>Nasir Chan, subadar of Pishawir, had wrote, repeatedly, to
the court of Delhi, for succours; but Chan Dowran, in his answers, affected
to despise the king of Persia; and insinuated, that it was
impossible he could meditate the conquest of Hin∣dostan. He, however,
promised, from time to time, that he himself would march with the imperial
army, and drive the invader back to Persia. The disaffected Omrahs wrote,
at the same time, to Nasir, to make the best terms he could with Nadir 
<PB N="13" REF="321"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1738.</NOTE>Shaw; for that there was
little hopes of his being reinforced with any part of the royal army.</P>
<P>Nasir Chan, finding himself neglected by the court, after a
faint resistance, surrendered himself prisoner to the king of
Persia, 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Novemb. 20.</NOTE>upon the 20th of
Shabân. He was soon after taken into favor by that monarch, and
appointed one of his viziers. Nadir Shaw had, by this time, crossed the
Attock or the Nilâb, one of the most considerable of the five
branches of the Indus. He issued out an order to ravage the country, to
spread the terror of his arms far and wide.</P>
<P>Daily advices of the approach of the Persians came to Delhi. A
general consternation among the people, and a distraction in the councils
of the government ensued. The king and his mi∣nister, Dowran, were so
weak, that either they did not suspect the treachery of the disaffected
Omrahs, or took no measures to prevent their designs. New obstacles were
daily thrown in the way of the military preparations of Dowran, till the Nizam
and his colleagues thought, that the procrastination which they had
occasioned, had sufficiently weakened the imperial cause.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">December 1.</NOTE>Upon the first of Ramzan,
the Vizier, the Nizam ul muluck, and Dowran, incamped without the city, with a
great train of artillery, and began to levy forces. Nadir Shaw, during these
transactions, crossed the Bea, and on the first of Shawal appeared
before Lahore. Zekeriah Chan, governor of the city and pro∣vince, who was
incamped with 5000 horse before the walls, retreated into the city. He, the
next day, marched out and attacked the Persians. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">1739.</NOTE><NOTE PLACE="marg">January.</NOTE>A general rout of his army was the con∣sequence,
and the conquerors were so close to the heels of the run-aways, that they
possessed themselves of the gates.—Ze∣keriah 
<PB N="14" REF="322"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1739.</NOTE>waited immediately upon
Nadir Shaw, with a nazir of half a lack of roupees, was politely received by
that monarch, and Lahore was preserved from being plundered.</P>
<P>The king of Persia continued his march towards Delhi, and, 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">February 14.</NOTE>upon the 14th of Zicada,
appeared in sight of the imperial army. Mahummud Shaw was incamped upon the
plains of Karnal; so that only the canal, which supplied Delhi with water,
divided the armies. The Moguls had only possessed themselves of that
ground about two days before the arrival of Nadir Shaw, and had thrown up
entrenchments and redoubts before them, mounted with five hundred pieces of
artillery. The army, which the king now commanded in person, consisted of
150,000 horse, ex∣clusive of irregular infantry. This unweildy body of
militia was composed of all sorts of people, collected indiscriminately
in the provinces, by the Omrahs, who thought that a sufficient number of men
and horses was all that was necessary to form a good army. Subordination
was a thing unknown in the Mogul camp: the private soldier, as well as the
Omrah, acted only by the impulse of his own mind.</P>
<P>The Persians, though not so numerous as the Moguls, were
under some degree of regulation. The rank of Nadir Shaw's officers was
determined; and his own commands were instantly and implicitly obeyed. Severe
to excess, he pardoned no neglect or disobedience in his Omrahs. He has
even been known to send an essawil<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A
mace-bearer.</NOTE> to a general, at the head of 5000 horse; with orders to
make him halt and receive corporal punishment, for a misdemeanor, in the
front of his own men. Though this rigor may be thought in Europe too tyrannical
and repugnant to a mi∣litary spirit; yet, in a country where the principles
of honor are <PB N="15" REF="323"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1739.</NOTE>little known, fear is the
strongest motive to a strict performance of duty.</P>
<P>Sadit Chan, 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">February 14.</NOTE>upon the 14th of Zicada,
having out-marched his baggage, joined the imperial army. Just as he was
receiving an honorary dress from Mahummud Shaw, advice came that the Herawils
of Nadir Shaw had attacked his baggage. Sadit Chan requested of the king to
be permitted to march out against the Herawils. The whole of this attack was
a plan concerted between Nadir Shaw and the traitor, in order to draw the
Mo∣guls from their entrenchments. The king, however, laid his commands upon
Sadit to wait until the next morning, when, 
<Q REND="inline">"by the favor of God,"</Q> he intended to march
out, with his whole army, to give the Persians battle.</P>
<P>But so little did Sadit regard Mahummud's orders, that, as
soon as he had quitted the presence, he issued out with 10000 horse,
which he had brought from his government, and attacked the enemy. A mock
engagement now commenced, between Sadit and a part of the Persian army; who
were ordered to retreat before him. He sent repeated messages, from the
field to the king, requesting more troops, and that he would drive the enemy
back to Persia.</P>
<P>Mahummud, justly incensed at the disobedience of Sadit,
would not, for some time, permit any succours to be sent to him. Chan
Dowran, at length, prevailed with the king to permit him, with 15000 men, to
support Sadit. When Chan Dowran came up to the field, Sadit, in a feigned
attack, joined the Persians, and permitted himself to be taken prisoner.
His design was to get the start of his partner in treason, Nizam ul
muluck, in en∣gaging the Persian monarch in his interest.</P>
<P> <PB N="16" REF="324"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></NOTE>In the mean time, the troops of Sadit being strangers to
the treachery of their commander, joined Chan Dowran, and con∣tinued the
engagement. Chan Dowran was immediately attacked on all sides, by the bulk of
the Persian army. He, however, for some time, maintained his ground with
great firmness and re∣solution; and was at length unwillingly drawn from
the field, though he had received a wound which soon after proved mortal, by
three repeated messages from the king, commanding his im∣mediate
attendance.</P>
<P>Mahummud Shaw was, with good reason, apprehensive that Nizam
ul muluck, who was then in the camp, was preparing to seize him, which made
him so anxious for the presence of Dow∣ran. When the wounded general
appeared before the king, he told him the situation of affairs, and
earnestly intreated him to permit him to return to the field, with the troops
which were under his immediate command, as captain-general, consisting of
36000 men, together with two hundred pieces of cannon. 
<Q REND="inline">"Grant my request," said he, "and you
shall never see me re∣turn but in triumph."</Q></P>
<P>The king was now perplexed beyond measure. He dreaded the
designs of the Nizam, should Dowran be absent, and, at the same time,
he durst not permit the traitor to march out of the lines, for fear he
should join the Persians. He, therefore, fell into the common error of weak
minds, and hesitated, in hopes that delay would give birth to a more
favorable concurrence of events.—He was deceived: the happy moment, for
the preser∣vation of himself and the empire, was now upon the wing. His
troops maintained still their ground, under Muzziffer, the gallant brother of
Dowran; and a reinforcement would turn the scale of victory in their
favor.</P>
<P> <PB N="17" REF="325"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1739.</NOTE>When Chan Dowran quitted the
field, the command of those Moguls, who were engaged, devolved upon his
brother Muzziffer. That brave Omrah made a violent charge upon the Persian
army, and penetrated to the very door of Nadir Shaw's tent. There, for want of
being supported from the camp, Muzziffer, Assil Ali Chan, Dowran's son,
Raja Gugermull, Meer Mullu, Eadgar Chan, and twenty-seven officers of
distinction, covered one small spot of ground with their bodies. Ten
thousand common Mogul soldiers were slain in this desperate action;
which had almost proved fatal to Nadir Shaw, for his whole army were upon the
point of giving way; several great detachments having fled back forty miles

Moguls, retired within the entrench∣ments<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Fraser

<P>Chan Dowran, though wounded, had that night an interview with
the Nizam ul muluck. It was agreed, that the whole army should next morning
march out of the lines, and attack the Per∣sians in their camp. But when the
morning came, Chan Dow∣ran's wound, which he had received in the arm, was so
much inflamed, that he could not act, and, therefore, the meditated at∣tack was
delayed. In the evening of the 18th, a mortification ensued, which was then
attributed to something applied to the wound by a surgeon bribed by the
Nizam; and many in India still continue in the same belief. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">February 18.</NOTE>Be that as it will, Chan
Dowran expired that night, amidst the tears of his sovereign, who had a
great friendship for him.</P>
<P> <PB N="18" REF="326"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1739.</NOTE>When this brave Omrah, on
whom alone the hopes of Ma∣hummud Shaw rested, was dead, Nizam ul muluck
stood un∣rivalled in the management of affairs. The whole authority de∣volved
upon him, and the king became a cypher in the midst of his own camp. The
traitor finding now the power of the em∣pire in his hands, under a certainty of
being able to dispose of the king at any time, according to his own
pleasure, set a treaty on foot with Nadir Shaw, for the immediate return of
that mo∣narch into Persia. So little hopes had the Persian, at this time,
of conquering the Mogul empire, that he actually agreed for the pitiful sum
of fifty lacks of roupees to evacuate Hindostan.</P>
<P>Sadit Chan, who, we have already observed, was in the
Persian camp, hearing of these transactions, used all possible
means to break off the treaty. The regard of Nadir Shaw to his plighted faith,
was not proof against the lucrative offers of Sadit. That Omrah promised to
pay to the Persian two crores of roupees out of his own private fortune, upon
condition he should reduce the Nizam, and place himself at the head of the
administration.—In the mean time, the Nizam, who was now appointed Amir
ul omrah, by Mahummud, finding that Nadir Shaw broke the treaty, began to talk
in a high strain, and to make preparations for coming to action with the
Persians, to which the king stre∣nuously urged him. But the active
spirit of Nadir Shaw was not idle during these transactions. He
possessed himself of several strong posts, round the Indian
camp, and totally cut off their supplies of provisions. The Nizam
perceiving that he must act with great disadvantage, if he should march
out of his lines and attack the Persians, began to renew the treaty, and
offered more than Sadit had done to Nadir Shaw.</P>
<P> <PB N="19" REF="327"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1739.</NOTE><NOTE PLACE="marg">February
20.</NOTE>Mahummud, being informed that these two villains, with∣out his
communication, were making separate bargains, about himself and his empire,
and that he even had not the shadow of authority in his own camp, took a
sudden resolution to throw himself upon the clemency of Nadir Shaw. 
<Q REND="inline">"A declared ene∣my," said he to the few
friends who still adhered to him, "is by no means to be dreaded so much as
secret foes, under the specious character of friends."</Q> Having,
therefore, previously acquainted the Persian of his intentions, he set
out in the morn∣ing of the 20th, in his travelling throne, with a small
retinue, for Nadir Shaw's camp.</P>
<P>The king of Persia, upon the Mogul's approach, sent his
son, Nisir Alla Mirza, to conduct him to the royal tent. Nadir Shaw
advanced a few steps from his Musnid, and embraced Mahum∣mud, and,
sitting down, placed him upon his left hand. The substance of their
conversation has been already given to the public by Fraser: and,
therefore, we shall only observe here, that Nadir Shaw severely
reprimanded Mahummud, for his pu∣sillanimous behaviour, in paying the Chout
to the Mahrattors, and for suffering himself to be invested in his camp,
in the very center of his dominions, without making one single effort to
re∣pel the invasion.</P>
<P>Nadir Shaw, after this conversation, retired to another tent,
called to him his vizier, and consulted with him what was best to be done
with Mahummud, in this critical situation. The vizier told him, that,
should he confine the king, the Nizam, who commanded the army, would
immediately act for himself; and, as he was an able officer, they might meet
with great diffi∣culty in reducing him. But that, should the king be
permitted to return to the camp with assurances of friendship and
pro∣tection, <PB N="20" REF="328"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1739.</NOTE>a party would join Mahummud,
that would, at least, be a ballance against the influence of the Nizam.</P>
<P>Nadir Shaw saw the propriety of what his vizier advised. He
immediately returned to the royal tent, and told Mahummud, that, as hitherto
the imperial house of Timur had not injured the Persians, it was far from
his intentions to deprive Mahum∣mud Shaw of his kingdom. 
<Q REND="inline">"But," said he, with a deter∣mined look, "the
expence of this expedition must be paid, and, during the time of collecting
the money, my fatigued army must refresh themselves in Delhi."</Q></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">February 24.</NOTE>The emperor made little
reply to Nadir Shaw's discourse. He was, however, permitted to return to
his camp, and the Per∣sian began to lay schemes to seize the Nizam. One
Casim Beg was employed in this affair. He, in Nadir Shaw's name, made the
Nizam many protestations of friendship, and obtained a promise, that he
would visit that monarch in his camp. He ac∣cordingly, upon the 24th, set
out, and was, immediately upon his arrival in the Persian lines, seized,
and, together with some great Omrahs who attended him, confined.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">February 26.</NOTE>Mahummud Shaw, looking
upon the Nizam's confinement as a plan laid by the traitor himself, in order
that he might negotiate matters with the Persian with more security,
determined to pay a second visit to Nadir Shaw.—That monarch had, by
this time, secured most of the Mogul omrahs, one after another, and when
Mahummud, upon the 26th, arrived in the camp, a tent was pitched for him near
the royal pavilion. The unfortunate Ma∣hummud was carried into his tent, and
left for some time alone. A collation was brought him, and he ate very
heartily; with∣out betraying any symptoms of being affected with his unhappy 
<PB N="21" REF="329"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1739.</NOTE>situation. Nadir Shaw was
greatly astonished when he heard of Mahummud's behavior, and exclaimed: 
<Q REND="inline">"What kind of man must this be, who can, with
so much indifference, give his freedom and empire to the wind? But we are
told, by the wise, that greatness of mind consists in two extremes: to
suffer patiently, or to act boldly; to despise the world, or to exert all
the powers of the mind to command it. This man has chosen the former: but the
latter was the choice of Nadir Shaw."</Q></P>
<P>Though Mahummud was hindered from returning to his own camp, he
was permitted to have all his domestics about him, who amounted to three
thousand. A thousand Kisselbash horse mounted guard upon him: but
this pretended honor, which was conferred upon him, was a certain badge of his
forlorn condi∣tion. In the mean time, Kummir ul dien, the vizier, Surbullind
Chan, Nizam ul muluck, and all the principal Mogul omrahs, were kept in the
same kind of honorable confinement. The Persian had now nothing to fear
from an army without officers. He entered the camp, seized upon the ordnance,
the military chest, the jewel-office, the wardrobe and armory.—He
ordered three months pay to be immediately advanced to his troops, and the
best of the artillery he sent off to Cabul.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">March
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE>Upon the 2d of Zehidge,
Nadir Shaw moved from Karnâl towards Delhi. The emperor, guarded by ten
thousand men, marched a few miles in his rear. The Mogul army were, at the
same time, ordered to march in two irregular columns, one on each side of
the Persians, the front of whose column was ad∣vanced two miles beyond the
other two. By continued marches, Nadir Shaw arrived upon the 8th in the
suburbs of the city. He himself, at the head of 12000 horse, entered the
city next day.</P>
<P> <PB N="22" REF="330"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1739.</NOTE>The king of Persia,
finding himself in possession of Delhi, called Nizam ul muluck and
Sadit Chan into his presence, and addressed them in the following
extraordinary manner; 
<Q REND="inline">"Are not you both most ungrateful villains to
your king and coun∣try; who, after possessing such wealth and
dignities, called me, from my own dominions, to ruin them and yourselves? But
I will scourge you all with my wrath, which is the instru∣ment of the
vengeance of God."</Q> Having spoke these words, he spit upon their
beards, and turned them, with every mark of indignity, from his presence.</P>
<P>After the traitors were thrust out into the court of the
palace, the Nizam addressed himself to Sadit Chan, and swore, by the
holy prophet, that he would not survive this indignity. Sadit Chan applauded
his resolution, and swore he would swallow poison upon his return home;
the Nizam did the same; and both determined in appearance upon death, retired
to their respective houses.</P>
<P>Sadit Chan, in the mean time, sent a trusty spy to bring
him intelligence when the Nizam should take his draught. The Nizam, being
come home, appeared in the deepest affliction: but having privately intimated
his plot to a servant, he ordered him to bring him the poison. The
servant acted his part well. He brought him an innocent draught, with great
reluctance. The Nizam, after some hesitation, and having formally said
his prayers, drank it off in the presence of Sadit's spy, and soon after
pretended to fall down dead.</P>
<P>The spy hastened back to his master, and told him that the
Nizam had just expired. Sadit, ashamed of being outdone in a point of honor
by his fellow in iniquity, swallowed a draught of <PB N="23" REF="331"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1739.</NOTE>real poison, and became
the just instrument of punishment to his own villainy. The Nizam was not
ashamed to live, though none had greater reason. He even prided in that
wicked trick, by which he had rid himself of his rival, and afterwards
actually enjoyed the intended fruits of all his villainies.</P>
<P>The Persian, in the mean time, placed guards upon the gates of
Delhi, with orders to permit no person whatever to pass in or out without
his special licence. These strict injunctions were given to prevent the
inhabitants from evacuating the place, and from carrying away their wealth. He,
at the same time, issued his commands, that no person whatsoever
should be molested; but he demanded twenty-five crores, as a contribution
for sparing the city.</P>
<P>Whilst the magistrates were contriving ways and means to
raise this enormous sum, by laying a tax in proportion to their wealth on
individuals, famine began to rage in the city, as all commu∣nication with the
country was cut off. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">March 10.</NOTE>Upon the 10th Nadir Shaw
ordered the granaries to be opened, and sold rice at a certain price. This
occasioned a prodigious mob in all the public Bazars, particularly in the
Shawgunge, or royal market. A Persian kis∣selbash in this market,
seeing a man selling pigeons, seized by force upon his basket. The
fellow, to whom the pigeons be∣longed, made a hideous outcry, and proclaimed
aloud, That Nadir Shaw had ordered a general pillage.</P>
<P>The mob immediately fell upon the Kisselbash, who was
pro∣tected by some of his own countrymen. A great tumult arose, and some
persons, bent upon more mischief, cried aloud, That Nadir Shaw was dead;
and that now was the time to drive the Persians out of the city. The
citizens, who in general carried <PB N="24" REF="332"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1739.</NOTE>arms, drew their swords,
and began to cut to pieces the Persians, wherever they could be found. The
report of the death of Nadir Shaw flew, like lightning, through every street
in Delhi; and all places were filled with tumult, confusion, and death. It
was now dark, and the Persians, who had been straggling through the city,
returned to the citadel, except two thousand who were killed by the mob.</P>
<P>About twelve o'clock at night, the king of Persia was informed
of these transactions. He immediately ordered what men he had with him
under arms, and, putting himself at their head, marched out as far as the
Musgid of Roshin ul Dowlat. He thought it prudent to halt there till
day-light should appear. He, in the mean time, sent for the Nizam,
Sirbillind Chan, and Kimmir ul dien, and threatened to put them to instant
death, charging them with fomenting these tumults. They swore upon the
Coran, that they were innocent, and he pardoned them.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">March 11.</NOTE>When day began to appear, a
person from a neighbouring ter∣race sired upon Nadir Shaw, and killed an
officer by his side. The king was so enraged, that, though the tumult had,
by this time, totally subsided, he ordered the officers of the cavalry to
lead their squadrons through the streets, and some musqueteers to
scour the terraces, and to commence a general massacre among the
unfortunate inhabitants. This order was executed with so much rigor, that,
before two o'clock in the afternoon, above 100,000, without distinction of
age, sex, or condition, lay dead in their blood, though not above one third
part of the city was visited by the sword. Such was the panic, terror and
con∣fusion of these poor wretches, that instead of bravely opposing
death, the men threw down their arms, and, with their wives and children,
submitted themselves like sheep to the slaughter. <PB N="25" REF="333"/>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1739.</NOTE>One Persian soldier
often butchered a whole family, without meetings with any resistance. The
Hindoos, according to their barbarous custom, shut up their wives and
daughters, and set fire to their apartments, and then threw themselves into
the flames. Thousands plunged headlong into wells and were drowned; death was
seen in every horrid shape; and, at last, seemed rather to be sought
after than avoided.</P>
<P>The king of Persia sat, during this dreadful scene, in the
Musgid of Roshin ul Dowlat. None but his slaves durst come near him,
for his countenance was dark and terrible. At length, the unfortunate emperor,
attended by a number of his chief Omrahs, ventured to approach him with
downcast eyes. The Omrahs, who preceded Mahummud Shaw, bowed down their
foreheads to the ground. Nadir Shaw sternly asked them what they wanted?
They cried out, with one voice, 
<Q REND="inline">"Spare the city."</Q> Mahummud said not a
word, but the tears flowed fast from his eyes. The tyrant sheathed his
sword, and said, 
<Q REND="inline">"For the sake of Mirza Mahummud, I
forgive."</Q></P>
<P>No sooner had he pronounced these words than, according to
our author, the massacre was stopt; and so instantaneous was the
effect of his orders, that in a few minutes every thing was calm in the city.
He then retired into the citadel, and inquired into the original cause of the
tumult. Seid Neaz Chan, the superintendant of the royal market, for having
been active in this affair, was put to death. Kisrah Chan, a brave Omrah, for
having defended his house against the Persians who came to massacre
his family, but who had not been concerned in the tumult, was beheaded.</P>
<P> <PB N="26" REF="334"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1739.</NOTE>The tyrant's thirst for
blood was not yet satisfied. He sent detachments daily to plunder the
villages near Delhi, and to put all the inhabitants to the sword. Six
thousand of the inhabitants of Mogulpurra were cut off for a very trivial
offence. He sent a party into the royal market, where the tumult first
arose, and ordered seven hundred persons to be seized
indiscriminately, and to cut off their noses and ears.</P>
<P>When now all disturbances were quelled by the blood of the
unfortunate Delhians, the king of Persia had leisure to pillage the city at
pleasure. He seized upon the public treasure and the regalia of Mahummud
Shaw. In the treasury several vaults were discovered, in which much
wealth lay concealed, as well as many valuable effects. In the public
treasury was found in specie, three crores of roupees: in the private
vaults near two crores more. The Jewaer Channa<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The
jewel-office.</NOTE> was estimated at twenty-five crores, including the Tucht
Taoos, which alone cost ten. The royal wardrobe and armory were valued at
five crores. Six crores were raised in specie, by way of contribution, upon
the city, and about eight crores in jewels; all which, together with horses,
camels and elephants, amount to about fifty crores, or sixty-two millions
five hundred thousand pounds of our money.</P>
<P>Great cruelties were exercised in levying the contributions
upon the city. Under an arbitrary government, like that of India, individuals
find it necessary to conceal their wealth. Some Omrahs, therefore, who had
very little were taxed very high, whilst others who were rich came off with a
moderate sum. Many of the former, under the supposition, that they
actually possessed more wealth, were, after they had given all they
were <PB N="27" REF="335"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1739.</NOTE>worth in the world, tortured
to death; whilst others, to avoid pain, shame and poverty, put, with their
own hands, an end to their miserable existence.</P>
<P>Upon the 21st of Mohirrim, the king of Persia celebrated the
nuptials of his son, Mirza Nasir Alli, with the daughter of Ezidan Buksh,
the son of Kaam Buksh, and grandson of the famous Aurungzebe. The Shaw
himself discovered a violent desire to espouse the beautiful daughter
of Muzisser Chan<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The brother of Chan Dowran. He was
slain in the battle at Karnal.</NOTE>; but he was prevented by one of his
wives, who had the art to command the furious spirit of Nadir Shaw, which the
rest of the world could not controul.</P>
<P>During all these transactions the gates of the city were
kept shut. Famine began to rage every day more and more; but the Shaw was
deaf to the miseries of mankind. The public spirit of Tucki, a famous
actor, deserves to be recorded upon this occasion. He exhibited a play
before Nadir Shaw, with which that monarch was so well pleased, that he
commanded Tucki to ask what he wished should be done for him. Tucki fell
upon his face, and said, 
<Q REND="inline">"O king, command the gates to be opened, that
the poor may not perish."</Q> His request was granted, and half the city
poured out into the country; and the place was supplied in a few days with
plenty of provisions.</P>
<P>The king of Persia, having now raised all the money he could
in Delhi, reinstated Mahummud Shaw in the empire, upon the third of Siffer,
with great solemnity and pomp. He placed the crown upon his head with his own
hand, and presented him with a rich chelat; distributing, at the same
time, forty more among the Mogul omrahs. He then gave to the emperor some
in∣structions concerning the regulation of his army; to which he 
<PB N="28" REF="336"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1739.</NOTE>added some general maxims
of government. He put him upon his guard against the Nizam, who, he plainly
perceived, aspired above the rank of a subject. 
<Q REND="inline">"Had not I," said the king of Persia,
"foolishly passed my word for his safety, the old<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Nizam was near ninety years of age.</NOTE> traitor should
not now live to disturb Mahummud."</Q></P>
<P>Every thing being ready upon the 7th, for Nadir Shaw's return to
Persia, strict orders were issued to his army to carry no slaves
away, nor any Indian women, contrary to their inclinations, upon pain of
immediate death. Before his departure, he obliged Mahummud formally to cede to
the crown of Persia, the pro∣vinces of Cabul, Peshawir, Kandahâr,
Ghizni, Moultan and Sind, or, in general, all those countries which lie to
the north-west of the Indus and Attoc. The whole of the treasure which
Nadir Shaw carried from Hindostan, amounted, by the best computa∣tion, to
eighty millions of our money.</P>
<P>When this destructive comet, to use the expression of
our Indian author, rolled back from the meridian of Delhi, he burnt all the
towns and villages in his way to Lahore, and marked his rout with devastation
and death. 
<Q REND="inline">"But before he disappears be∣hind the
mountains of Persia," says our author, continuing the metaphor of the
comet, "it may not be improper to throw some light on the character of this
scourge of Hindostan."</Q> Nadir Shaw, together with great strength of
body, was endued with uncommon force of mind. Innured to fatigue from his
youth, struggling with dangers and difficulties, he acquired vigor from
opposition, and a fortitude of soul, unknown in a life of ease. His
ambition was unbounded and undisguised: he never fawned for power, but
demanded it as the property of his superior parts. Had he been born to a
throne, he deserved it; had he conti∣nued <PB N="29" REF="337"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1739.</NOTE>a subject, his glories
would have been less dazzling, but more permanent and pure.</P>
<P>In a country where patriotism and honor are principles little
known, fear is the only means to inforce obedience. This ren∣dered Nadir Shaw
so cruel and inexorable, that often, in his rage and the hurry of action, he
inflicted general punishments for the crimes of a few. Courage, which he
possessed in com∣mon with the lion, was his only virtue; and he owed
his great∣ness to the great defects of his mind. Had his eye melted at human
miseries, had his soul shuddered at murder, had his breast glowed once
with benevolence, or, had his heart revolted at any injustice, he might have
lived to an old age, but he would have died without the name of Nadir<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Wonderful.</NOTE>.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION II. The Conclusion of the Reign of MAHUMMUD
SHAW.</HEAD>
<P>THE king of Persia having evacuated Hindostan, the Nizam
began to discover his own ambitious designs. His rivals were now all
removed; some by his villainy, and others by favorable accidents. Without
opposition, the management of affairs fell into his hands. Though he
ingrossed, in fact, the whole power, he delegated the great offices of
state to others. The name of vizier was retained by Kimmir ul Dien, and that
of Buckshi, or captain-general, was conferred upon the Nizam's son, Ghazi
ul Dien Chan. He appointed Emir Chan subadâr of Allahabad, which so
disgusted Mahomed Chan Bunguish, to whom that government was promised
by the former administra∣tion, that he left the court without leave, and
repaired to his Jagier at Ferochabad.</P>
<P>The government of Oud being vacant by the death of Sadit Chan,
that subaship was conferred upon an Omrah, called Seifdar Jung, together
with the title of Burhan ul muluck. The Nizam, having nothing to fear from the
subas of the other provinces, continued them in their employs.
Notwithstanding the severe blow which the empire had just received, no
measures were taken to revive the declining power of the crown. This was, by
no means, the interest of the Nizam, who now assumed every thing of the
king, but the name.</P>
<P>Mahummud Shaw having suffered himself to be divested of
his power in his capital, it could not be expected that his autho∣rity should
be much regarded in the provinces. The nabobs <PB N="31" REF="339"/> and rajas,
throughout the empire, paid now little attention to the firmâns of the
court of Delhi. Each of them entertained ideas of independence, and actually
possessed a regal authority in their governments.—The Mahrattors,
who had, for some time back, made large strides to establish the
ancient Hindoo government in India, 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1740.</NOTE>in the year 1153, made an
incursion into the Carnatic with an army of eighty thousand horse, under
the command of Ragojee. Having forced the passes of the mountains, they
fell unexpectedly upon Doost Ali, nabob of that province, in subor∣dination
to the Nizam, who was governor-general of the Decan. The forces of Doost Ali
were defeated, and he himself, together with his son, Hassin Ali, fell
in the action, after having exhibited extraordinary feats of bravery and
firmness.</P>
<P>Sipadar Ali, the son, and Chunder Saib, the son-in-law of
Doost Ali, had still considerable armies under their command. But both
having views upon the government of the province, instead of opposing the
Mahrattors, committed hostilities upon one another. The consequence was,
that they were obliged to shut themselves up in places of strength, the
first in Velour, and the latter in Trichinopoly. The enemy were, by this
means, permitted to ravage the province at their leisure, and to raise
heavy contributions upon the inhabitants.</P>
<P>Sipadar Ali, finding he could effect nothing in the field
against the Mahrattors, set a negotiation on foot with them, by the means
of his father's minister, who had been taken prisoner in the action by
those barbarians. It was at last determined in private, that, upon
condition the Mahrattors should immediately evacuate the Carnatic, they
should receive one hundred lacks of roupees, at stated periods; and that,
as a security for the payment of this sum, they should be put in
possession of the territory of <PB N="32" REF="340"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1740.</NOTE>Trichinopoly. One of the
terms was, that Sipadar Ali-should be acknowledged nabob of the Carnatic.</P>
<P>Ali, having thus strengthened himself with the alliance of
the Mahrattors, his brother-in-law thought it prudent to pay him homage at
Arcot; not knowing that Trichinopoly, and those districts which he
possessed, had been made over to the Mahrattors. The barbarians, in the
mean time, returned to their own domi∣nions; but, about six months
thereafter, they made a second ir∣ruption into the Carnatic, to take
possession of the territories which had been privately ceded to them by
Sipadar Ali. Chunder Saib shut himself up in Trichinopoly; and after
sustaining a siege of three months, was, upon the seventh of Mohirrim,
1154, obliged to surrender at discretion.</P>
<P>These transactions in the Decan did not disturb the peace
at Delhi. The king and his ministers continued in a profound lethargy ever
since the invasion of Nadir Shaw, and seemed indifferent about the
affairs of the distant provinces. But a pressing danger at home roused
them for a moment. A fellow, from the low rank of a grass-cutter, raised
himself to the command of a gang of rob∣bers. As in the debilitated state
of government, he committed, for some time, his depredations with impunity,
his banditti, by degrees, swelled to an army of twelve thousand men. He
im∣mediately assumed the imperial ensigns, under the title of Daranti
Shaw. This mushroom of a king was, however, soon destroyed. Azim Alla, a
gallant Omrah, was sent against him with an army from Delhi. He came up
with the rebels, cut the most of them to pieces, and slew Daranti in the
action. This happened in the 1153 of the Higera.</P>
<P> <PB N="33" REF="341"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1741.</NOTE>In the month of Regib, 1154,
Sipadar Ali, nabob of the Carnatic, was assassinated by his
brother-in-law, Mortaz Ali, who immediately acceded to the Musnud. But a
general mutiny arising in the army, the murderer was obliged to fly from his
capital, in a female dress; and Mahummud Chan, the son of Sipadar, was
proclaimed suba of the Carnatic.</P>
<P>The Nizam, who claimed the sovereignty of the Decan, seeing
these repeated revolutions in the Carnatic, without his concurrence, began to
prepare to leave the court of Delhi. He settled his affairs with the
ministry, and returned to Hydrabad. He imme∣diately collected an army, and,
in the month of Ramzan, 1155, marched towards the Carnatic with near
three-hundred thousand men. In the Sisser of 1156, the Nizam arrived at
Arcot with∣out opposition; and found the country in such anarchy and
con∣fusion, that no less than twenty petty chiefs had assumed the
titles of Nabob. The Nizam made a regulation, that whoever should take the
name of Nabob, for the future, without permission, should be publickly
scourged; and raised immediately Abdulla Chan, one of his own generals, to
the subaship of Arcot; ordering the son of Sipadar Ali into confinement.
He, at the same time, possessed himself of the city of Trichonopoly
by means of a sum of money which he gave to Malhar Raw, who commanded there
on the part of the Mahrattors.</P>
<P>The Nizam, without drawing the sword, thus settled the
affairs of the Carnatic. He returned in triumph to Golcondah, whither Abdulla
Chan, the new governor of Arcot, accompanied him. Abdulla, returning towards
his government, was, the first night after his taking leave of the Nizam,
found dead in his bed; not without suspicion of poison from Anwar ul Dien
Chan, who succeeded him in the nabobship of Arcot, in the year 1157.</P>
<P> <PB N="34" REF="342"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1741.</NOTE>The Nizam in this absolute
manner disposed of the provinces of the Decan, without the concurrence of
the court, and actually became king of that country, though he never
assumed that title. In the mean time, the Nizam's son, Ghazi ul Dien
Chan, overawed Mahummud Shaw at Delhi, and left that indo∣lent prince no more
than the mere shadow of royalty.</P>
<P>Whilst the Decan, that great limb of the Mogul empire, was cut
off by the Nizam, Aliverdi Chan usurped the government of Bengal, Behar, and
Orissa. This fellow was once a common soldier, who, together with his
brother Hamed, came from Tartary in quest of service to Delhi. In that city
they continued for some time in the service of the famous Chan Dowran, and
afterwards became menial servants to Suja Chan, nabob of Cattack. Suja Chan,
after the death of Jassier Chan, succeeded to the government of the three
provinces of Bengal, Behar, and Orissa.</P>
<P>The two Tartars, being possessed of good natural parts
and some education, rose gradually into office, and were greatly fa∣vored
by the nabob. Hodjee Hamed had, in a manner, be∣come his prime minister, and,
by his political intrigues in the Haram, obtained the place of Naib, or deputy
of the province of Behar, for his brother Aliverdi, who was then a captain of
horse.</P>
<P>Aliverdi was not long established in his high employ, when
he began to tamper with the venal ministry of Delhi, for a se∣parate
commission for the province, which he then held of Suja Chan. Money, which
has great influence in every country, is all powerful in Hindostan. Aliverdi
strengthened his solicita∣tions <PB N="35" REF="343"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1741.</NOTE>with a round sum, and, by
the means of Chan Dowran, became independent suba of Behar.</P>
<P>Suja Chan dying soon after, was succeeded in the
subaship of Bengal by his son Sirfaraz Chan. We do not mean to
insinuate, that he had any right of inheritance to his father's government,
or that the subadary had been established in his family by any grant of
the crown, which was contrary to the established laws of the empire: but
the government was now so weak, that the nabobs took upon themselves to
bequeath their governments to their sons, which were afterwards, through a
fatal necessity, ge∣nerally confirmed to them from Delhi.</P>
<P>Sirfaraz, being a man of a haughty and imperious
disposition, soon lost the affection of all his officers. He
disgraced Hodjee Hamed, and tarnished the honor of the powerful family of
Jagga Seat. Hamed, however, took advantage of the general disaffection to
Sirfaraz's government. He formed a conspiracy against the nabob, and
invited his brother Aliverdi to invade Bengal. Aliverdi accordingly marched
from Patna, in the month of Ramzan 1154, and entering Bengal, defeated and
killed Sir∣faraz Chan, at Geriah, near Muxadabad, and, without further
opposition, became suba of the three provinces.</P>
<P>The weak emperor, instead of chastising the usurper with
an army from Delhi, fell upon an expedient, at once disgraceful and
impolitic. The Mahrattors threatened Mahummud for the Chout, which, before the
Persian invasion, he had promised to pay them; and he gave them a
commission to raise it themselves upon the revolted provinces. The
Suu<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Suu, in the Shanscrita language, signifies
<HI>Glorious.</HI></NOTE> Raja, the chief of the Mahrattors, sent accordingly
an army of 50000 horse, from <PB N="36" REF="344"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1742.</NOTE>his capital of Sattara, to
invade Bengal. This force, under the conduct of Boscar Pundit, ravaged, with
fire and sword, all those districts which lie to the west of the
Ganges.</P>
<P>Aliverdi, who was a brave soldier, defended himself with
great resolution. But he owed more to his villainy than to his arms. Having
found means to assassinate the leader of the Mahrattors, he forced them
to retreat.—When the news of this horrid murder reached the ears of the
Suu Raja, he ordered two other armies into Bengal; one by the way of Behar, and
another by that of Cattack. The first was, commanded by Balla Raw, and the
latter by Ragojee.—Aliverdi, not being able to cope with this great force
in the field, had recourse to art. He sowed dis∣sention between the two
chiefs; set a private treaty on foot with Balla Raw; who, having received two
years Chout, evacuated the provinces, leaving his colleague to make the best
terms he could for himself. The scale was now turned against the
Mahrattors. Ragojee retreated to Cattack, and, with constant incursions and
flying parties, greatly harrassed the provinces. The good fortune of
Aliverdi at length prevailed, and he saw himself independent sovereign of
Bengal, Behar, and Orissa: though, to quiet the minds of the people, he
pretended to pos∣sess grants from the court, which he himself had
actually forged.</P>
<P>We have been purposely succinct on the manner in which the
Decan and Bengal were dismembered from the empire, as the facts are already
pretty well known in Europe. We re∣turn, now, to, the affairs of the interior
provinces. This subject has hitherto been touched by no writer, and very few
Euro∣peans in Asia have made any considerable enquiries concern∣ing it.</P>
<P> <PB N="37" REF="345"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1744.</NOTE>During these
transactions, nothing happened at Delhi, but the intrigues and factions of a
weak and corrupt administration. In the year 1157, Ali Mahummud, a Patan of
the Rohilla tribe, Zemindar of Bangur, and Awla, began to appear in arms. Ali
was a soldier of fortune, and a native of the mountains of Cabulistan, who,
some years before his rebellion, came to Delhi, with about three hundred
followers of his own tribe, and was entertained in the service of Mahummud
Shaw. Being esteemed a gallant officer, the command of a small district,
upon the road between Delhi and Lahore, was conferred upon him; where he
entertained all vagrants of his own clan, who came down in quest of military
service, from their native mountains. In this man∣ner Ali expended all the
rents of his district, and he was hard pressed for the payment of the
crown's proportion of his income, by the fogedar of Muradabad, to whom he was
accountable.</P>
<P>Hernind, the fogedar, despairing to get any part of the
re∣venue from Ali Mahummud, by fair means, prepared to use force. He raised
15000 of his own vassals, with a design to ex∣pel or chastise the
refractory Zemindar. Ali, by the assistance of his northern friends, who
lived upon him, defeated the fogedar, with great slaughter, and thus laid the
foundation of the Rohilla government, now so formidable in Hindostan.</P>
<P>Kimmir ul Dien, the vizier, upon receiving intelligence at Delhi
of this blow to the regal authority, dispatched his own son, Meer Munnu, a
youth of great bravery, with an army of 30000, against the rebels. Meer
Munnu, crossing the Jumna, advanced to a place called Gurmuchtisher, on
the banks of the Ganges, and found that Ali Mahummud had acquired so much
strength since his late victory, that he feared the issue of an
en∣gagement. A negotialion, therefore, was set on foot, and, after 
<PB N="38" REF="346"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1745.</NOTE>the armies had lain three
months in sight of one another, a treaty was concluded. The conditions were,
that Ali Mahummud should keep possession of the countries, formerly
comprehended in the government of Hirnind, upon paying the ancient revenues to
the crown, and that, in the mean time, one year's payment should be advanced
in four months.</P>
<P>After this treaty was ratified, Meer Munnu returned to Delhi:
but the appointed time elapsed, without any payments on the part of Ali
Mahummud. He continued to strengthen himself, annexed more districts to
his government, and ravaged the neighbouring countries to subsist his
army. He, in short, be∣came formidable enough to rouse the indolent
Mahummud Shaw from his lethargy. That monarch took the field, with fifty or
sixty thousand horse, and, in the year 1158, crossed the Jumna.</P>
<P>Ali Mahummud, upon the king's approach, retreated across the
Ganges, and shut himself in Bangur, a place of some strength, where the
imperial army invested him. The rebel, for the first two nights, made
successful sallies, and killed many in the camp of Mahummud Shaw. The
king, however, having drawn lines of circumvallation round the fort, after a
short but bloody siege, obliged the garrison to capitulate. Ali made
terms for his own life, and he was brought prisoner to Delhi, where he
remained in confinement for six months.</P>
<P>The Patan chiefs, who were always, in private, enemies to the
government of the Moguls, casting their eyes upon Ali Mahum∣mud, as a very
proper person to raise their own interest, solicited the emperor for
his release. The weak monarch granted their request; but the Patans, not
yet satisfied, obtained for Ali Ma∣hummud <PB N="39" REF="347"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1747.</NOTE>the fogedarship of
Sirhind.—This was such wretched policy in the court of Delhi, that
nothing but downright infa∣tuation, folly, and the last degree of corruption
in the ministry, could ever have permitted it to take place. The
consequence was, that Ali Mahummud collected his dispersed tribe, kept
possession of Sirhind, of several districts between the rivers and
beyond the Ganges, without remitting one roupee to court.</P>
<P>We have already seen, that all the provinces to the
north-west of the Indus were ceded to Nadir Shaw. When that conqueror was
assassinated in Persia, Achmet Abdalla, a native of Herat, who had
raised himself in his service, from the office of Chobdar, or
mace-bearer, to that of Chazanchi, or treasurer, found means, with the
assistance of his own tribe, in the confusion which suc∣ceded the
Shaw's death, to carry off three hundred camels loaded with wealth, to the
mountains of Afganistan. This treasure enabled Abdalla to raise an army,
and to possess himself by de∣grees of the districts of the mountains,
Herat, part of Chor∣rassan, and all the provinces ceded by the crown of
Hindostan to the king of Persia. Thus Abdalla laid the foundation of an
empire, in those countries, which formerly composed the great monarchy of
Ghizni.</P>
<P>Achmet Abdalla, perceiving the declining state of the Mogul
government in Hindostan, crossed the Attock, in the beginning of the year
1160, and raising contributions upon his march, advanced towards Delhi, with
50000 horse. The poor Delhians were struck with universal panic. The king
himself was sick; and there were distractions in the councils of the
ministers. The pressure of the danger cemented all their differences.
Ahmed Shaw, the prince royal, Kimmir ul Dien, the vizier, Seid Sul∣labit 
<PB N="40" REF="348"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1747.</NOTE>Chan, and Seifdar Jung, took
the field, with 80000 horse, and marched to oppose the invader.</P>
<P>The imperial army left Delhi upon the 18th of Sisser, and
advanced to a place called Minoura, ten crores beyond Sirhind. Abdalla's army
were here in sight; and both, afraid of the issue of a battle, strongly
entrenched themselves. In this situation they remained for thirty days;
sometimes skirmishing, and at other times negotiating; but Ahmed Shaw
having no money to give, Abdalla would not retreat.</P>
<P>Abdalla, in the mean time, found means to advance some pieces
of artillery, which bore upon the flank of the imperial army. In the evening
the vizier, being at prayers, received a shot in the knee, and died that
night. As he was very much esteemed by the army, which in reality he
commanded, though the prince bore the name, it was proposed to Ahmed Shaw, by
Meer Munnu, the vizier's son, to conceal his death, lest the troops, who
depended upon his courage and capacity, should be affected by that accident.
The prince, seeing the propriety of this measure, called together a few of
his principal Omrahs, and held a council of war. It was resolved, that the
body of the vizier should be mounted upon his own elephant, in the Howadar,
supported with pillows; and that in the morning, by day-break, they should
issue out of the camp and engage the enemy.</P>
<P>Orders were accordingly given that night to the Omrahs, to hold
their troops in readiness, and their respective stations ap∣pointed to
each. In the morning, before day, the imperial army was in motion; but Abdalla,
having previous notice of their intentions, had prepared to receive them in his
camp. The young prince Ahmed led the attack with uncommon bravery, 
<PB N="41" REF="349"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1747.</NOTE>and was gallantly seconded
by Meer Munnu, who performed surprizing feats of personal valour.—The
Persian defended him∣self with equal resolution, for the space of three
hours. At length, his entrenchments were trodden down by the elephants, and the
imperial army poured into his camp.</P>
<P>An unfortunate circumstance, at this instant, totally
changed the face of affairs. Issur Singh, the son of Joysingh, raja of
Amere, who commanded twenty thousand horse, rode up to the vizier's
elephant for orders, and discovered that he was dead. Issur Singh was
naturally a coward, and only wanted an excuse to hide his head from danger.
He turned immediately his face from the field, and was followed by all his
troops. The flight of so great a part of the army drew many after them,
parti∣cularly Seifdar Jung, nabob of Oud. Abdalla not only recovered his troops
from their confusion, but pressed hard upon the im∣perialists in his
turn.</P>
<P>Meer Munnu, upon this urgent occasion, displayed all the
bravery of a young hero, together with all the conduct of an old general. He
formed in a column, and encouraging his troops, by words and example, bent his
whole force against Abdalla's center. He, at the same time, dispatched a
messenger to Issur Singh and Seifdar Jung, assuring them that
Abdalla was already defeated, and if they would return and assist him in
the pursuit, he would permit none of them ever to repass the Indus. The
stratagem had the desired effect. They returned in full gallop to the
field, and re∣newed the charge with great bravery.</P>
<P>Abdalla, having almost assured himself of the victory,
was, by this unexpected check, thrown into great confusion. Meer Munnu took
immediate advantage of the enemy's consternation, <PB N="42" REF="350"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1747.</NOTE>drove them off the field,
and pursued them five crores beyond their camp. The loss was nearly equal
on both sides; but a compleat victory remained to the Moguls; for which they
were entirely indebted to the surprising efforts of Meer Munnu.</P>
<P>A single defeat was not enough to discourage Abdalla, who
was a brave officer. He collected his discomfited army, dis∣graced some
of his chief Omrahs, conferred their rank and honors upon others, rewarded
those who had behaved well, and, with his sword drawn, riding through and
through his troops, encouraged them again to action. The Moguls were not a
little surprized, next morning, to see Abdalla, whom they prepared to
pursue, with his army drawn up in order of battle before their
camp.—This uncommon confidence in a defeated enemy, threw a damp upon the
courage of the conquerors. They contented themselves with forming the line,
and with standing in expecta∣tion of the charge.—Abdalla, as the prince
had some advantage of ground, at the same time declined coming to action,
and, in the evening, encamped at a small distance.</P>
<P>The second day was spent in skirmishes, and a distant
can∣nonade: but, upon the third, to use a Persian expression, the
interval of battle was closed, and the shock was very violent. Though
irregular armies of horse make little impression upon a solid body of
well-disciplined infantry; yet when they engage one another, upon equal
terms, each trusts to the strength of his own arm, and the battle is in
general extremely bloody. This irregular kind of attack, it must be allowed,
requires a greater degree of personal courage, where man to man is opposed,
than to stand wedged in a close battalion, where the danger may in∣deed be
as great, but not so apparent.</P>
<P> <PB N="43" REF="351"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1747.</NOTE>The young prince Ahmed
distinguished himself in a particular manner in this action; and Meer
Munnu, tenacious of the glory he had already acquired, was not to be
resisted. Abdalla, after an obstinate resistance, was again driven
off the field, and pur∣sued across the Suttuluz. Here Abdalla, in spite
of his misfor∣tunes, like an able and gallant commander, put the best face
upon his affairs. He had lost all his artillery and baggage, and being now
less incumbered than the imperial army, he made a forced march, and, taking a
circuit to the right, repassed the river, and next day, to the
astonishment of the prince and Meer Munnu, was heard off eighteen crores in
their rear, in full march towards Delhi.</P>
<P>Intelligence of Abdalla's march being received in the capital,
every thing fell into the utmost confusion, and a general panic prevailed.
Ghazi ul Dien, the nizam's son, being at court, collected what forces he
could, and marched out of the city to oppose Abdalla. The enemy hearing of
this army in their front, would proceed no further. His troops, with one voice,
told Abdalla, That, before they advanced towards Delhi, it was necessary to
defeat the imperial army which was behind them. He was therefore constrained
to march back towards the prince and Meer Munnu, who expected a third battle:
but Abdalla thought it prudent to decline it; and, by night, repassed the
Moguls, and continued his rout to Lahore.</P>
<P>A change of affairs at the court of Delhi happening at this
time, prevented the prince and Meer Munnu from pursuing Abdalla. They
encamped on the banks of the Suttuluz, where Ahmed Shaw proposed to confer
the subaship of Lahore upon any of his Omrahs who would undertake to
recover it from Abdalla. After this offer had been declined by all of them, it 
<PB N="44" REF="352"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1747.</NOTE>was accepted upon these
terms by Meer Munnu; who, with a division of the army, marched towards
Lahore, while Ahmed Shaw returned with the rest to Delhi. Mahummud Shaw had
an inviolable friendship for his vizier, Kimmir ul Dien Chan. In the
tottering state of the regal authority, all his confidence was reposed in
that minister. When therefore the news of Kimmir's death came to him at
Delhi, he immediately considered his own affairs as desperate. He retired
to a private apartment, and wept bitterly all night. In the morning he mounted
the throne as usual, to give public audience; and, whilst every flat∣tering
courtier was running out in praise of the deceased, the emperor seemed
much affected. He, at last, exclaimed: 
<Q REND="inline">"O cruel fate! thus to break the staff of my
old age.—Where now shall I find so faithful a
servant?"—</Q>With these words he fell into a fit, to which he was
sometimes subject, and expired sitting upon his throne.</P>
<P>The death of Mahummud Shaw happened upon the 8th of Ribbi ul
Sani, in the 1160 year of the Higera, after a disastrous reign of thirty
years. The court endeavored to conceal his death till his son prince Ahmed
should arrive. He accordingly, upon the 7th day after his father's decease,
entered Delhi; being sent for by express from Ghazi ul Dien Chan, who was
supposed by the ignorant vulgar, who are always ready to ascribe sudden
deaths to violence, to have made away with Mahummud Shaw.</P>
<P>MAHUMMUD SHAW was remarkably comely; of a stately stature
and affable deportment. He was no small proficient in the learning of his
country; and he wrote the Arabic and Persian languages with the greatest
elegance and propriety. He was personally brave; but the easiness and
equality of his tem∣per made his actions appear undecisive and irresolute.
Good-natured <PB N="45" REF="353"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1747.</NOTE>to a fault, he forgave, in
others, crimes which his own soul would abhor to commit; and thus he
permitted his autho∣rity to become a victim to an ill-judged clemency.
Naturally indolent and diffident of his own abilities, his mind perpetually
fluctuated from one object to another. His passions therefore took no
determined course of their own; but were easily diverted into any channel,
by whatever person was near him.— 
<Q REND="inline">"The soul of Mahummud," said a Mogul who
knew him well, "was like the waters of a lake, easily agitated by any
storm, but which settle immediately after the winds are laid,"</Q> If his
easiness or irresolution in politicks led him into many errors, he bore
with indifference, if not with sortitude, the misfortunes which were their
natural consequence.</P>
<P>Born in the sunshine of a court, brought up in the bosom
of luxury, confined within the walls of a zennana, and, in a man∣ner, educated
among eunuchs, as effeminate as those whom they guard, we are not to wonder
that the princes of the East should degenerate in a few generations. If to
these obstructions to the exertion of the manly faculties of the soul, we
add the natural lenity of Mahummud, a common but unfortunate virtue in the race
of Timur, it ought not to surprize us, that in a country like India, his
reign should be crowded with uncommon misfor∣tunes. Had his fate placed
Mahummud in Europe, where established laws supply the want of parts in a
monarch, he might have slumbered with reputation upon a throne; and left
behind him the character of a good, though not of a great, prince.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION III. The History of the Reign of AHMED SHAW.</HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1747.</NOTE>UPON the 17th of Ribbi ul
Sani, in the year 1160 of the Higera, AHMED SHAW, the son of Mahummud,
mounted the throne of Delhi. The first act of this reign, was the
ap∣pointment of Seifdar Jung, the irresolute suba of Oud, to the vizarit.
This fellow was originally a merchant of Persia, known there by the name of
Abul Munsur. He travelled to India to sell his commodities; and was
retained there as an accomptant, by the famous Sadit Chan, governor of Oud. He
behaved so much to his master's satisfaction in that station, that he
advanced him to a command in the army, and conferred upon him his daughter in
marriage. His alliance with Sadit so much raised his interest at the
court of Delhi, that, upon the death of his father-in-law, he was raised to
the subaship of Oud. Though he was a very bad soldier, such was the
smoothness of his tongue and plausibility of behavior, that he passed
upon the weak as a man of considerable parts; which, together with some
know∣ledge in the finances, paved his way to the high employ of vizier. Ghazi
ul Dien continued bukshi; and no other material changes in the
administration happened upon the accession of Ahmed.</P>
<P>The war with Abdalla, which was now carried on in Punjab by Meer
Munnu with various success, ingrossed the attention of the court of
Delhi; for the greatest part of the imperial army was employed in that
service. Advices, in the mean time, arrived from the Decan, of the death of
the famous Nizam ul muluck, in the one hundred and fourth year of his age; and 
<PB N="47" REF="355"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1747.</NOTE>that his second son,
Nasir Jung, acceded to the government. It may not, perhaps, be out of place
here, to give a short sketch of the character of the Nizam, who for a long
time made so great a figure in India.</P>
<P>The Nizam, though no great warrior, was reckoned a consum∣mate
politician, in a country where low craft and deceit, with∣out any principles of
honor and integrity, obtain the appellation of great parts. The dark designs
of his mind lay always con∣cealed behind an uncommon plausibility and
eloquence of tongue. His passions were so much under his command, that he
was never known to discover any violent emotion even upon the most critical
and dangerous occasions: but this apathy did not arise from fortitude, but
from deep dissimulation and designs. It was with him an unalterable maxim
to use stratagem rather than force; and to bring about with private
treachery, what even could be accomplished with open force. He so
habituated him∣self to villainy, that the whole current of his soul ran in
that channel; and it was even doubtful whether he could for a moment divert it
to honesty to bring about his most favored designs. If the Nizam shewed
any tendency to virtue, it was by substituting a lesser wickedness
for a greater. When fraud and circumvention could accomplish his purpose,
he never used the dagger or bowl. To sum up his character in a few words;
without shame, he was perfidious to all mankind; without remorse, a traitor
to his king and country; and, without, terror, a hypocrite in the presence of
his god.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Nasir Jung, the nizam's son, having
rebelled, was at the head of a great army. The deceitful old man counterfeited
sickness so well, and wrote such pathetic letters to Nasir,
requesting to see him before he died, that the young fellow was taken in
the snare, visited his father, and was imprisoned.</NOTE></P>
<P> <PB N="48" REF="356"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1748.</NOTE>When the news of Nizam ul
muluck's death came to Delhi, Ghazi ul Dien, who was his eldest son,
applied to the king for his subaship. But Nasir Jung, being
possessed of his father's treasure, raised a great army, and
marched from Aurungabad towards Delhi; not on pretence of war, but to pay his
respects to the emperor. Ahmed dreaded nothing more than this cere∣monious
visit from a man at the head of so great a force. He judged that Nasir
Jung, under that specious pretext, covered a design to extort from him a
confirmation of the subadary of the Decan. He therefore durst not favor the
pretensions of Ghazi to the provinces of the Decan, and consequently was
reduced to the necessity of confirming Nasir Jung in his usurpation.
Thus the storm was diverted, and the new Nizam returned to Aurungabad.</P>
<P>In the year 1161, Caim Chan Bunguish, jagierdâr of
Feroch∣abad, having differed with Ali Mahummud, a neighbouring Zemindar, they
both drew out their vassals and dependents, and fought about ten crores
above Ferochabad, and Caim Chan was defeated and slain. Seifdar Jung, the
vizier, being informed of these transactions, sent orders to Raja Nevil
Roy, his deputy in the province of Oud, to confiscate the estate of Caim
Chan. The deputy rigorously executed the vizier's orders. He seized upon
Caim Chan's five sons, together with five of his adopted slaves, confined,
and afterwards assassinated them at Allahabad. Ahmed Chan, another
son of Caim Chan, remained still alive; and, in order to revenge the death
of his brothers, raised the Patan tribe, of which he was now acknowledged
chief, and marched against Nevil Roy, who had collected all his forces to
oppose him.</P>
<P> <PB N="49" REF="357"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1748.</NOTE>In the beginning of the year
1162, the two armies met at a place near Lucknow, called Callinuddi. The Patans
were scarcely four thousand strong; but the army of the deputy of Oud
consisted of at least twenty thousand. The Patan chief, inspired by
revenge, and vigorously supported by his friends, attacked in person
Nevil Roy in the very center of his army, and slew his enemy with his own
hand. The army of Nevil Roy, seeing him fall, immediately quitted the field.
Their artillery and baggage, and soon after almost the whole province of
Oud, fell into the victor's hands.</P>
<P>When the news of this disaster arrived at Delhi, Seifdar
Jung, the vizier, talked in a very high strain, and requested of the
emperor, that he might be permitted to lead an army against Ahmed Chan. The
sultan consented; but the season being far spent before the army was
levied, the expedition was deferred till the solstitial rains should be
over. In the month of Mohirrim, 1163, the vizier, with an army of eighty
thousand men, marched from Delhi; and, without distinction of age, sex,
or condition, put all the Patans he could find to the sword. Ahmed Chan was
not intimidated by this great force. With scarce twelve thousand men he
marched from Ferochabad, and met the imperialists at Shuru Sahawir, near that
city.</P>
<P>The day happened to be very windy, and Ahmed improved that
circumstance to his own advantage. He wheeled to windward, and the dust
flew in such clouds in the face of the imperial army, that they did not
discover the motions of Ahmed; but ascribed the darkness which involved
themselves to the effects of a whirlwind, common at that season of the
year. The enemy, however, like a thunderbolt, issued from the bosom of
this storm, and at once struck the Moguls with terror and dismay. 
<PB N="50" REF="358"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1749.</NOTE>The Patans made such good
use of their swords, that they soon covered the field with dead; and the
cowardly Seifdar Jung, without making one effort, was the first of his army
who fled. The Jates and Rohillas, though thus shamefully deserted by their
general, made head against Ahmed Chan, and found means to carry off the
greatest part of the artillery, which consisted of twelve hundred pieces
of various bores. But neither of those tribes returned the guns to the king:
they carried them to their own forts, to strengthen themselves against
his authority.</P>
<P>This overthrow was a dreadful stroke to the tottering empire.
The greatest part of the province of Oud was lost; the Jates, a numerous
tribe of Hindoos, who possessed a large territory near Agra; and the
Rohillas, a Patan nation, who inhabited the greatest part of the country
between Delhi and Lucknow, seeing the whole imperial force baffled by a petty
chief, began to throw off their allegiance. Seifdar Jung, in the mean time,
arrived with a small part of his army at Delhi; and Ghazi Chan advised the
king to put him to death for the disgrace which he had drawn upon his arms.
This punishment would not have been too severe for the vizier's bad
behaviour: but that minister had strengthened his interest by a coalition
with Juneid Chan, the chief eunuch.</P>
<P>The queen-mother, Begum Kudsia, being a woman of gal∣lantry,
had, for want of a better lover, fixed her affection upon the chief eunuch. She
had the address to direct the weak monarch in every thing, and to keep him in
leading-strings upon the throne. Juneid Chan, though in no public employ, by
means of Kudsia's favor, held the helm of government; and, by his influence,
not only saved the vizier's life, but continued him in his office.</P>
<P> <PB N="51" REF="359"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1750.</NOTE>In the course of the
same year, a treaty was concluded with the Mahrattors, who were spreading,
their devastations over the southern provinces. The Chout was stipulated
to be regularly paid by the empire to those troublesome barbarians. Ahmed
Shaw ordered an army to be levied, to recover the province of Oud; and it was
soon compleated by the accession of forty thou∣sand Mahrattors, who
inlifted themselves in the imperial service. But instead of putting
himself at the head of his forces, the weak emperor, by the advice of his
mother and her gallant, gave the command of it to his vizier, that he might
have an opportunity to retrieve his lost honour.</P>
<P>Raja Sourage Mull, prince of the Jates, by the acquisition of
the Mahrattors to the imperial army, judged it prudent once more to join the
vizier with all his forces; so that the minister's army now consisted
of no less than one hundred thousand men. Seifdar Jung marched from Delhi,
in the year 1164, against Ahmed Chan: but the Raja of the Jates, instead of
aiding him, found means to frustrate all his designs. Having spent a
whole campaign without coming to action, he patched up a very dishonorable
peace, and returned to Delhi with the Mahrattor mercenaries at his heels,
mutinous for want of their pay.</P>
<P>The demand of the Mahrattors amounted to fifty lacks of roupees,
which the government was in no condition to pay: and the sum gradually
increased with the delay. Ghazi ul Dien, who had been for some time
soliciting for a royal commission for the subaship of the Decan,
promised to pay off the Mahrattor debt, upon condition he should receive
from the emperor that appointment. Ahmed Shaw was glad upon any terms to pet
rid of those clamorous and dangerous mercenaries, and accordingly issued
out the imperial sunnuds to Ghazi. That Omrah having <PB N="52" REF="360"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1751.</NOTE>satisfied the Mahrattors
in their demands upon Ahmed, engaged them immediately in his own service; and
having added to them a great army of either troops, obtained his own office of
buckshi for his son Ghazi, a youth of fifteen years of age, and marched
towards the Decan.</P>
<P>The elder Ghazi's brother, Nasir Jung, suba of the Decan,
and his son Muziffer, who had succeeded him in the government, were both
dead. Sillabut Jung, the third son of the old Nizam, now sat upon the
Musnud, which Ghazi claimed by the right of primogeniture. In the month of
Zehidge, 1165, he, with an army of one hundred and fifty thousand men,
arrived in the environs of Aurungabad. The forces of his brother, Sillabut
Jung, the reigning suba, were somewhat inferior in number, but they were
strengthened by a body of French mercenaries, which, in all probability,
would insure to him the victory. Sillabut Jung, however, was afraid of the
issue of a general battle; and, after some slight skirmishes, he
found means to prevail with his uncle's wife to take off his competitor with
poison. Thus did the perfidious Sillabut Jung secure to himself the
empire of the Decan, without a rival.</P>
<P>But to return to the transactions of the court of Delhi:
Seifdar Jung, the vizier, finding that his own influence declined, and that
Juneid Chan, the favorite eunuch, carried all before him, invited him to an
entertainment, and, contrary to the laws of hospitality, and altogether
forgetful that he owed to Juneid his own life and fortune, assassinated
him by the hands of Ishmaiel Chan, one of his adopted slaves. Ahmed Shaw,
being informed of this presumptuous villainy, flew into a violent rage,
degraded Seifdar Jung from the vizarit, and banished him the court. This was
the effect of a sit of passion; for the unfortunate king was 
<PB N="53" REF="361"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1751.</NOTE>in no condition, in fact, to
exert so far his authority. The per∣fidious vizier, finding that he had
nothing to hope from submis∣sion, broke out into open rebellion. He
soon after, by the assistance of the Jates, advanced to Delhi, and
besieged Ahmed Shaw and young Ghazi, the buckshi, in that city.</P>
<P>The son of Kimmir ul Dien, who, in the reign of Mahummud, held
so long the vizarit, was raised, under the title of Chan Chanan, to the
vacant employ of Seifdar Jung, and began to shew some abilities in his new
office. Young Ghazi, who was a youth of extraordinary parts, defended the city
with great reso∣lution for three months. The rebels were at last so
dispirited, that Ghazi ventured to attack them in the field, and gained a
complete victory. Seifdar Jung fled towards his former subaship of Oud, and
left his allies, the Jates, under Raja Sourage Mull, to extricate themselves
from the perilous situation to which he had brought them.</P>
<P>The rebellion of Seifdar happened in the year 1166. The Jates
being deserted by him, were in no condition to keep the field against
Ghazi. They fled before the imperial army under Akebut Chan, to their own
territories near Agra. That general invested the strong fortress of
Billemgur, which he took by capi∣tulation; but so little did he regard his
plighted faith to the gar∣rison, that he put them all to the sword. The
Jates, in the mean time, came before the imperial army; but diffident of their
own strength in the field, they separated their forces, and shut
themselves up in their forts. The imperial general also divided his army
into detachments, and laid at once siege to the two strong forts of Dieg
and Combere, lying in the territory between Agra and Delhi.</P>
<P> <PB N="54" REF="362"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1752.</NOTE>Ghazi ul Dien, in the mean
time, to carry on more effectually the war against the Jates, obtained
permission from the emperor, to call in forty thousand Mahrattors, under
their two chiefs, Jeiapa Malhar Raw, and Raganut Raw. By this acquisition of
strength, the imperialists were enabled to carry on the sieges with
vigor. At Delhi, young Ghazi and the new vizier con∣tended for the command of
the army. This contest was after∣wards fatal in its consequences; but for
the present Ghazi ul Dien prevailed. He marched with a reinforcement from
Delhi; and, upon his arrival in the country of the Jates, took the com∣mand of
the imperial army.</P>
<P>The sieges continued two months after the arrival of Ghazi;
and the garrisons were reduced to the last extremities. The
im∣perialists, in the mean time, had expended all their ammunition; and Ghazi
was, upon that account, obliged to dispatch Akebut Mahmood to Delhi, with a
good force, to bring him the necessary stores. The vizier seeing that
the strong holds of the Jates must soon fall into the hands of Ghazi,
should he be supplied with ammunition, and being extremely jealous of any
thing that might throw honor upon his rival, poisoned the mind of the weak
king against his buckshi, by means of forged letters and villainous
insinuations, that the young Omrah aspired to the throne. The enterprizing
genius, and great abilities of Ghazi, gave some color to suspicions of
that kind; and the unfortunate Ahmed, in∣stead of promoting his own cause
against the Jates, took every measure to prevent the success of
Ghazi.</P>
<P>The king accordingly begun to levy forces in Delhi, and wrote a
letter to Raja Sourage Mull, the chief of the Jates, to make an obstinate
defence, and that he himself would soon relieve him: that, under pretence
of joining the army under Ghazi, he would <PB N="55" REF="363"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A.D. 1752.</NOTE>attack that general in the
rear, and at the same time display a signal to the Raja, to sally from
the fort of Combere.—Thus the king, as if infatuated by his evil genius,
planned his own ruin. His letter fell into the hands of Ghazi, whose friends
at court had informed him of the intrigues of the vizier. Struck with the
king's ingratitude, and urged on by self-defence, he immediately resolved
upon open hostility. He raised the sieges, and crossed the Jumna, to
oppose Ahmed Shaw and his vizier, who were marching down between the
rivers.</P>
<P>The king, hearing of Ghazi's approach, halted at Secundra, and
endeavoured, by fair promises, to bring back that Omrah to his duty. Ghazi,
in answer to the king's message, returned to him his own letter to Raja
Sourage Mull. He wrote him, at the same time, that 
<Q REND="inline">"he could place no confidence in a man, who
plotted against his life, for no crime; if to serve the state was not
one. What mercy," continued Ghazi, "can I ex∣pect from Ahmed, in the days of
rebellion, when he treated me as a traitor, in the days of loyalty and
friendship? A prince, that is weak enough to listen to the base
insinuations of every sycophant, is unworthy to rule over brave men; who,
by the laws of God and nature, are justified to use the power which
providence has placed in their hands, to protect themselves from
injustice."</Q></P>
<P>The king perceived, by the strain of this letter, that Ghazi
was resolved to push him to the last extremity. He, however, durst not
engage him in the field. He made the best of his way to Delhi, and was so
closely pursued by Ghazi, that that Omrah possessed himself of
one of the gates; upon which Ahmed Shaw and the vizier shut themselves up,
with a small party, in the citadel. Ghazi immediately invested the place;
and the <PB N="56" REF="364"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1753.</NOTE>king, after a faint
resistance, surrendered himself. Ghazi, after reproaching him for his
intentions against his life, committed him and the vizier to the charge of
Akebut Mahmood. The unfortunate sultan was deprived of sight, the next day,
by the means of an hot iron. It is said, by some, that this was done by
Akebut Mahmood, without orders, to shew his zeal for the ser∣vice of his
patron; but, from the general character of Ghazi, we have no reason to doubt
his being concerned in this crime.</P>
<P>Thus ended the reign of the unfortunate Ahmed Shaw: a prince,
who, in his first exploits, appeared with some lustre. When he mounted
the throne, as if action degraded royalty, he altogether gave himself up to
indolence. To save the trouble of thinking, he became the dupe of every
specious flat∣terer, and at last fell the unlamented victim of his own
folly. He possessed all the clemency of the house of Timur; but that
virtue was now, in some measure, a vice, in a country so corrupt, and in
an age so degenerate. Though Ahmed was not defective in personal courage,
he may truly be said to be a coward in mind: dangers appeared formidable to
him, through a troubled imagi∣nation, which, upon trial, he had fortitude to
surmount.—He sat upon the throne of Delhi seven lunar years and one
month; and was deposed in the month of Jemmad ul awil, in the 1167 of the
Higera.</P>
<P>The power and extent of the empire were very much dimi∣nished
in the reign of Ahmed Shaw. All the provinces, except those between the
frontiers of the Jates, a few miles to the east of Delhi, and Lahore to the
west, were, in fact, dismembered from the government of the house of
Timur, though they paid a nominal allegiance. The rich kingdom of Guzerat was
divided between the Mahrattors and a Patan tribe, called Babbé; the 
<PB N="57" REF="365"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1753.</NOTE>Decan was usurped by the
Nizam ul muluck's family; Bengal, Behar, and Orissa, by Aliverdi Chan, and
his successors; Oud, by Seifdar Jung; Doab, by Ahmed Chan Bunguish;
Allahabad, by Mahummud Kuli; and the countries round Agra, by Raja Sourage
Mull, the chief of the Jates.—Budaoon, and all the provinces to the north
of Delhi, were in the hands of Mahum∣mud Ali, Sadulla Chan, and other chiefs of
the Rohilla tribe of Patans. A number of petty Rajas started up into
independent princes in Malava: Bucht Singh seized upon the extensive
ter∣ritory of Marwâr, and Madoo Singh reigned in the provinces round
Joinagur and Amere.</P>
<P>The gallant Meer Munnu still opposed the torrent of
invasion from the north. He maintained the war with success, against
Abdalla, for the provinces of Moultan and Punjab, and, for a short space of
time, supported the declining empire. Every petty chief, in the mean time, by
counterfeited grants from Delhi, laid claim to jagiers and to districts: the
country was torn to pieces by civil wars, and groaned under every species of
domestic confusion. Villainy was practised in every form; all law and
religion were trodden under foot; the bands of private friend∣ships and
connections, as well as of society and government, were broken; and every
individual, as if amidst a forest of wild beasts, could rely upon nothing
but the strength of his own arm.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION IV. The History of the Reign of ALLUMGIRE
SANI.</HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A.D. 1753.</NOTE>UPON the same day that
Ahmed Shaw was deprived of sight, Ghazi ul Dien released from confinement
Eaz ul Dien, the son of Moaz ul Dien, and grandson of Bahadar Shaw, the
son and successor of the famous Aurungzebe. This prince was placed by
Ghazi upon the throne, by the name of ALLUM∣GIRE. To begin his reign with an
act of beneficence, he ordered seventeen persons of the imperial house of
Timur to be released from prison, to grace his coronation. It may not be
improper here to say something concerning the inauguration of the Mogul
emperors.</P>
<P>When a prince is, for the first time, seated upon the
throne, with the royal umbrella over his head, the Omrahs, according to their
dignity, are ranged in two lines before, one upon his right, the other to his
left hand. A herald then proclaims his titles; and the Omrahs, each in his
station, advance with an offer∣ing in gold, which he himself receives from
their hands. The superintendant of the kitchen brings then a golden salver,
with bread, confections, and other eatables, over which the king, joined by the
whole court, repeats a form of grace; and then he eats a little, and
distributes the remainder, with his own hand, among the nobility. This latter
is an ancient Mogul ceremony, introduced by the family of Timur. The emperor
mounts then his state-elephant, and, attended by all the court, moves
slowly towards the great Musgid, throwing, as he advances, gold, silver,
precious stones, and pearls, among the populace. In the Musgid he repeats a
prayer, and afterwards divine service is performed by <PB N="59" REF="367"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1753.</NOTE>the Sidder ul
suddûr, or the metropolitan of Delhi. The Chutba, or the genealogy and
titles of the king, are then read, and he re∣turns to the palace with the
same magnificence and pomp. The Mogul emperors are never crowned: but upon
some festivals they sit in state, under a large golden crown, which is
suspended by a chain to the roof of the presence-chamber, and serves
the purpose of a canopy.</P>
<P>Allumgire found himself as much a prisoner upon the throne,
as he was formerly in his confinement. He was not a man of parts sufficient
to extricate himself from the toils of that power, to which he owed his
advancement; but had he made no efforts to acquire some authority, the empire
might have been, perhaps, restored to its original dignity and splendor, by
the very extraor∣dinary abilities of Ghazi ul Dien.—That Omrah now
possessed the office of the vizarit. Allumgire, without the capacity of
guiding the operations of government himself, began to turn all his mean
parts to thwart the schemes of the vizier. Without considering whether the
measure was right or wrong, it was suf∣ficient that it came from the
vizier, for the emperor to oppose it by his minions.</P>
<P>This aversion in the king to Ghazi, did not long escape the
penetrating eyes of that young Omrah. He knew that he was surrounded by many
enemies, and therefore was unwilling to resign an employ, from which he
derived protection to his own person. In the mean time all business was
suspended, and the two factions, like armies afraid of the issue of a
battle, watched the motions of one another.—Nothing remarkable happened
at Delhi, during the first year of Allumgire, but the assassination
of the former vizier, about six months after his imprisonment, by the
orders of Ghazi ul Dien.</P>
<P> <PB N="60" REF="368"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1754.</NOTE>But, in the course of this
year, the empire received a severe blow on its frontiers, by the death of the
gallant Meer Munnu, by a fall from his horse. He had, in many engagements,
de∣feated Abdalla, and recovered from him the whole province of Lahore. No
sooner was this brave Omrah dead, than Abdalla re∣conquered all he had
lost; and, advancing to Lahore, confirmed his son, then an infant, in the
government of that place, under the direction of an experienced Omrah.</P>
<P>The great success of Abdalla, in the north-west, began to
rouse the court of Delhi. It was at last resolved, that Ali Gohar<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The present emperor.</NOTE>, Allumgire's eldest son,
should, in conjunction with Ghazi ul Dien, the vizier, march with the
imperial army against the Persians. The treasury was now empty; and the
few provinces, subject to the empire, were grievously oppressed for
money to raise a force for this expedition.</P>
<P>In the beginning of the year 1169, the imperial army,
con∣sisting of 80000 men, under the prince and young Ghazi, took the field.
They advanced to a place called Matchiwarra, about twenty crores beyond
Sirhind. They found Abdalla so well established in his new conquests,
that they thought it prudent to proceed no further. The whole campaign
passed in settling a treaty of marriage, between the vizier and the
daughter of Meer Munnu. It seems that Omrah, to strengthen his interest
at the court of Delhi, had, before his death, promised his daughter to Ghazi;
but, after that event, both the young lady and her mother were extremely
averse to the match. When the imperial army lay at Matchiwarra, the vizier
inveigled both the ladies from Lahore to the camp, and finding all intreaty was
in vain to obtain their consent, he, with peculiar baseness, closely
confined them, to intimidate them into a compliance. This together with
op∣pressing <PB N="61" REF="369"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1755.</NOTE>the provinces, through which
he marched, comprehended the whole exploits of Ghazi on this expedition. After
spending all the public money in this vain parade, the prince and vizier,
without striking a blow, returned to Delhi.</P>
<P>The cause of this inaction of the vizier proceeded from
ad∣vices which he daily received from court. The king and his faction gained
strength during his absence; and he foresaw his own ruin, in case he
should meet with a defeat from Abdalla. Upon his return to Delhi, he found it
necessary, in order to support his declining authority, to act with great
rigor and tyranny. Some Omrahs he removed with the dagger, and others he
deprived of their estates. He confined the king in the citadel, and did
whatsoever he pleased, as if he himself was vested with the regal
dignity.</P>
<P>Allumgire, finding himself in this disagreeable situation,
adopted a very dangerous plan to extricate himself. He wrote privately to
Abdalla, to advance with his army, to relieve him from the hands of his
treacherous vizier. He promised, that upon his arrival on the environs of
Delhi, he should be joined by the bulk of the imperial army, under the
command of Nigib ul Dowla, a Rohilla chief, to whom Ghazi had delegated his own
office of buckshi, when he rose to the employ of vizier. Thus the weak
Allumgire, to avoid one evil, plunged headlong into greater misfortunes.</P>
<P>Abdalla, having received these assurances from the king,
marched from Cabul, where he then kept his court, entered Hindostan with a
great army, and, in the year 1171, appeared before Delhi. The vizier marched
out with the imperial forces to give him battle; but, in the field he was
deserted by his <PB N="62" REF="370"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1757.</NOTE>friend, Nigib ul Dowla, with
the greatest part of his army. The ignorance of Ghazi ul Dien of a plot so
long carried on, is a great proof of his extreme unpopularity. The
consequence was, that Ghazi was obliged to throw himself upon the clemency
of Abdalla, who had sworn vengeance against him, should he ever fall into
his hands. But such was the address of the vizier, that he not only found
means to mollify the Persian, but even to make him his friend. He was,
however, at first turned out of his office, but he was soon after
restored by Abdalla himself, who now disposed of every thing, as if he
was absolute king of Delhi.</P>
<P>Abdalla entered the city, and laid the unfortunate inhabitants
under a contribution of a crore of roupees; a sum now more difficult to
raise than ten crores, in the days of Nadir Shaw. The Persian remained two
months in Delhi. The unhappy Allumgire, not only found that his capital was
robbed, but that he himself was delivered over again into the hands of a
person, who had now added resentment to ambition and power.</P>
<P>The Persian, after these transactions, took the prince,
Hedad Buxsh, brother to the present emperor, as hostage for Allumgire's
future behavior; and, having forced Meer Munnu's daughter to solemnize her
marriage with Ghazi, marched towards Agra. He, on his way, laid siege to
Muttra, took it by assault; and, having sacked the place, put the
inhabitants to the sword, for the enormous crime of attempting to defend
their lives and pro∣perty. After this scene of barbarity, Abdalla advanced to
Agra, which was held on the part of the king<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Though the
Jates had all the country round Agra, they had not yet possessed
themselves of that city.</NOTE> by Fazil Chan. This Omrah defended the city
with such resolution, that Abdalla, <PB N="63" REF="371"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1757.</NOTE>after sustaining some
loss, thought it prudent to raise the siege; but, being exasperated at
this repulse, he spread death and de∣vastation through the territories of
the Jates, who, unable to cope with him in the field, had retired into their
strong holds; from which, they at times issued, and cut off his
straggling parties.—The Persian returned to a place called Muxadabad,
about eight crores from Delhi. Allumgire came out to pay his respects to him;
and, by his conduct, seems to have been per∣fectly infatuated. When the cries
of his distressed people reached heaven, that contemptible monarch,
instead of endeavoring to alleviate their miseries, either by force or
negotiation, was wholly bent on the gratification of a sensual appetite.
The cause of his visit to Abdalla, was to obtain his influence and
mediation with Sahibe Zimany, the daughter of Mahummud Shaw, whom he wanted to
espouse; the princess herself being averse to the match. When kings,
instead of exerting their talents for the protection of their people,
suffer themselves to be absorbed in indolence and sensuality,
rebellion becomes patriotism, and treason itself is a virtue.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the news of some incursions from the
west∣ern Persia, into the territories of Abdalla, recalled that prince from
India. Malleké Jehan, the widow of Mahummud Shaw, and her daughter
Sahibe Zimany, claimed his protection against Allumgire. He carried them both
to Cabul, and some time after espoused the daughter himself.—The
Persian having evacuated the imperial provinces, the vizier became more cruel
and oppres∣sive than ever: he extorted money from the poor by tortures, and
confiscated the estates of the nobility, upon false or very frivolous
pretences. To these tyrannies he was no less driven by the necessity of
supporting an army to inforce his authority, than he was by the natural
avidity and cruelty of his own unprincipled mind.</P>
<P> <PB N="64" REF="372"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1758.</NOTE>The king and his eldest
son, Ali Gohar, were, in the mean time, kept state prisoners. The latter
made his escape in the year 1172, and levying six thousand men at Rowari,
began to raise the revenues of the adjacent territories. After he had
continued this vagrant kind of life for nine months, the vizier, by the means
of insidious letters, in which Ittul Raw, chief of the Mahrattors, Raja
Dewali Singh, Raja Nagor Mull, and many other Omrahs, swore to protect him,
inveigled him to Delhi. But, in violation of all oaths and fair promises, he
was instantly confined by Ghazi, in the house of Alla Murda Chan, where he
remained for the space of two months.</P>
<P>The vizier having received intelligence that the prince was
privately attaching some Omrahs to his interest, and fearing that, by their
means, he might again make his escape, determined to remove him to the
citadel. He ordered a detachment of five hundred horse to execute this
service. The prince not only refused to comply with the vizier's orders for
his removal, but ordered the gates of the house to be shut, and, with a few
friends, betook himself to arms. The houses of the nobility in Hindostan
are surrounded by strong walls; and, in fact, are a kind of small forts.
The vizier's troops found it therefore extremely difficult to reduce the
prince. He was besieged closely for two days; and, finding that he could
not defend himself much longer from the thousands that surrounded the
house, he formed the gallant resolution to cut his way through the
enemy.</P>
<P>He imparted his intentions to his friends, but they shrunk
from his proposal as impracticable. At last, six of them, seeing him
resolved to attempt this desperate undertaking alone, pro∣mised to
accompany him. On the morning of the third day, <PB N="65" REF="373"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1758.</NOTE>they mounted their horses
within the court. The gate was suddenly thrown open, and they issued
forth sword in hand, with the prince at their head. He cut his way through
thousands of Ghazi's troops, with only the loss of one of his gallant
follow∣ers. Raja Ramnat, and Seid Ali, were the two principal men concerned in
this extraordinary exploit; the other four being common horsemen. Seid Ali
was wounded, but four and the prince escaped without any hurt.</P>
<P>The prince having thus forced his way through the vizier's army,
issued out of the city, and arrived at a place, called Vizierabad, about
six crores from the suburbs. Ittul Raw, the Mahrattor chief, lay encamped
with ten thousand horse at Vizier∣abad. Ittul had been hired as a mercenary
by the vizier, to sup∣port him in his tyrannical proceedings: but resenting
Ghazi's breach of promise to the prince, and not being regularly paid, he now
thought of plundering the country under the sanction of Ali Gohar's name. He
received him, therefore, with very great respect, and promised to support
him.</P>
<P>The prince, and Ittul Raw, accordingly continued, for the
space of six months, to raise contributions on the provinces to the
south of Delhi: but as the petty chiefs of villages had, during the
confusions of the empire, constructed mud forts, whither they retired with
their families and effects, at the approach of danger, the Mahrattors found
great difficulty in supporting themselves, as none of those forts could
be reduced without a regular siege, in which they were very little skilled.
Ittul Raw, tired of this kind of unprofitable war, proposed to the prince to
retire to Gualiêr, where the Mahrattors had now established a
government, promising to give him a tract of country for his maintenance. 
<PB N="66" REF="374"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1759.</NOTE>Ali Gohar thanked the
Mahrattor for his generous proposal, but declined to accept of it.</P>
<P>His eyes were now turned to another quarter. Nigib ul Dowla, who
had, at the king's request, betrayed Ghazi ul Dien to Ab∣dalla, was, upon the
reinstatement of the vizier in his office, obliged to fly to his jagier of
Secundra, between the rivers, about forty crores below Delhi. The prince looked
upon him as the most proper person to conduct his affairs. He accord∣ingly
took leave of Ittul Raw, crossed the Jumna, arrived at Secundra, and was
received with great respect by Nigib ul Dowla, who, however, did not think
proper to join heartily in his cause.</P>
<P>To return to the transactions at Delhi: Ahmet Abdalla had no
sooner settled his affairs, than he prepared for an∣other expedition into
Hindostan. He resolved to support his army with the plunder of that
country, and to keep them in action there for other enterprizes more arduous.
He accordingly marched from Candahar, and, in the month of Ribbi ul awil, 1174,
arrived in the environs of Delhi. The unhappy Allumgire applied to him for
relief; and, if possible, exaggerated his own misfortunes, and the
unheard of villainies of his vizier. He, at the same time, by his
emissaries, stirred up factions in the army of Ghazi, who had marched out
of the city to give battle to Abdalla. The discerning mind of that minister
soon penetrated into the king's machinations against him. He did not for a
moment hesitate what to do; his hands had already been imbrued in blood, and
he started not at murder. He resolved to take off the king, and then to let
future events direct his line of action.</P>
<P> <PB N="67" REF="375"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A.D. 1760.</NOTE>Though the king was in some
measure a prisoner, he was permitted to keep his guards and a great retinue
of ser∣vants. They pitied his misfortunes, and became firmly attached to his
interest. Abdalla, who was near with his army, seemed to give some
encouragement to Allumgire, and that prince's party acquired strength every
day. The vizier saw himself hemmed in upon all sides by enemies; he,
therefore, thought it high time to assassinate his master.—He
knew the weakness and superstition of the mind of Allumgire. He,
therefore, trumped up a story concerning a Fakier, who prophesied and
wrought miracles at the Kottulah of Ferose Shaw. The poor enthusiastic
king, just as Ghazi expected, expressed a great desire to see the
holy Fakier. As it would derogate from the reputation of the pretended saint,
to pay a visit, even to a king; Allumgire resolved to confer upon him that
piece of respect.—But he had no sooner entered the apartment where
the holy impostor sat, than two assassins started from behind a
curtain, cut off his head with a scimiter, and threw his body, out of a back
window, upon the sands of the Jumna. It lay there two days without interment;
none daring to pay the last office to the remains of their unfor∣tunate king.
This tragedy was acted at Delhi, in the month of Ribbi ul Sani, 1174.</P>
<P>Such was the end of Allumgire, who, in an age of peace and
tranquillity, might have lived with some reputation, and have died with the
character of a saint. But the times required uncommon abilities in a king,
and the most vigorous exertion of the manly faculties of the soul; neither
of which that unhappy monarch in any degree possessed. His struggles,
therefore, against the ambition of Ghazi, were puerile and impotent. Had he
employed the assassin against the breast of that treacherous
mini∣ster, justice would have warranted the blow; had he possessed 
<PB N="68" REF="376"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A.D. 1760.</NOTE>courage to have aimed it with
his own hand, a thousand oppor∣tunities were not wanting. What then can be
said in favor of a man, who durst not make one manly effort for his
authority, or resent indignities which he daily received in person?</P>
<P>The perfidious vizier ordered the body of the king, after lying
two days exposed on the sand of the Jumna, to be privately interred. He
then took another prince of the blood, and placed him upon the throne, by the
name of Shaw Jehan.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION V. Transactions at the Court of Delhi, from the
Death of ALLUMGIRE SANI, to the present Times.</HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1761.</NOTE>NIGIB UL DOWLA, who had,
some time before the assassination of Allumgire, made up matters with
the vizier, had the address to retain the office of buckshi. Shocked at the
villainy of Ghazi, or desirous to transfer to himself the whole power, he
again betrayed that minister, and went over with all his forces to Abdalla.
Ghazi, in consequence of this desertion, found himself obliged also to
make peace with the invader.</P>
<P>These factions proved fatal to the unhappy Delhians. Abdalla
laid the city under heavy contributions, and inforced the col∣lection with
such rigor and cruelty, that the unfortunate inhabi∣tants, driven to
despair, took up arms. The Persian ordered a general massacre, which,
without intermission, lasted for seven days. The relentless
Durannies<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The tribe, of which Abdalla is the chief, are
distinguished by that name.</NOTE> were not even then glutted with
slaughter, but the stench of the dead bodies drove them out of the city. A
great part of the buildings were, at the same time, reduced to ashes, and
many thousands, who had escaped the sword, suffered a lingering death
by famine, sitting upon the smoaking ruins of their own houses. Thus the
imperial city of Delhi, which, in the days of its glory, extended itself
seven∣teen crores in length, and was said to contain two millions of
people, became almost a heap of rubbish.</P>
<P> <PB N="70" REF="378"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1761.</NOTE>The miseries of the
unfortunate Delhians were not yet at an end. The Mahrattors, who now, without
intermission, traversed the empire for plunder, advanced to partake of
the spoils of Delhi with Abdalla. Jincow and Malharraw, accordingly, occupied
the environs of the city. The Persian marched but against them, and both
armies joined battle at a place called Mudgenu Tuckia, two crores from the
depopulated capital. The Mahrattors were defeated, and pursued one hundred
and fifty crores from the field: but they, in the mean time, gave Abdalla the
slip, turned his rear, and set out in full march for Delhi. The Durannies,
however, were so close to their heels, that, before they could attempt any
thing against the city, they were a second time obliged to retreat.</P>
<P>In the mean time news arrived, that the Mahrattor chiefs were
advancing with another very numerous army from the Decan, with a professed
design to re-establish the ancient Hindoo government. Bisswass Raw,
Baow, and Ibrahim Chan Ghardi, commanded this force, which, independent of the
army of Mahrattors, whom Abdalla had already defeated, consisted of one
hundred thousand horse. The Mahommedans were struck with terror; they
thought it necessary to join Abdalla, to support the faith: Suja ul
Dowlat, who had succeeded his father, the infamous Seifdar Jung, in the
province of Oud, Ahmed Chan Bunguish, chief of the Patans and all the petty
chieftains of the Rohillas, hastened with their forces to Delhi.</P>
<P>The Mahrattors had now entered the territories of the Jates, and
summoned Raja Sourage Mull to join them. Though Sourage Mull, as a Hindoo,
wished for the extirpation of Mahommedism in India, he was too jealous of
the power of the Mahrattors, to obey their orders. Enraged at his obstinacy, 
<PB N="71" REF="379"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1761.</NOTE>they carried fire and
sword through his dominions, com∣pelled him at last to join them with fifty
thousand men.</P>
<P>The Maharattors now consisted of two hundred thousand
horse, and the Mahommedans, whom Ahmet Abdalla commanded in chief, of near
one hundred and fifty thousand. The eyes of all India were now turned towards
the event of a war, upon which depended, whether the supreme power should
remain with the Mahommedans, or revert again to the Hindoos. Upon the approach
of the Mahrattors, Abdalla evacuated Delhi, and, having crossed the Jumna,
encamped on the opposite bank.</P>
<P>The Mahrattors immediately entered the city, and filled every
quarter of it with devastation and death. Not content with robbing the
miserable remains of Abdalla's cruelty of every thing they possessed,
they stripped all the males and females quite naked, and wantonly whipped
them before them along the streets. Many now prayed for death, as the
greatest blessing, and thanked the hand which inflicted the
wound.—Famine begun to rage among the unfortunate citizens to such a
degree, that men fled from their dearest friends, as from beasts of prey,
for fear of being devoured. Many women devoured their own children, while
some mothers, of more humanity, were seen dead in the streets, with
infants still sucking at their breasts.—But let us now draw a veil
over this scene of horror.</P>
<P>Ghazi ul Dien found, by this time, that Abdalla was become his
enemy, and inclined to the interests of Nigib ul Dowla. He therefore
endeavoured to make up matters with the Mahrattors, but his proposals were
rejected. He then turned himself to the Raja of the Jates, who was in the
field an unwilling auxiliary to the Mahrattors, and persuaded him to desert
their cause, and <PB N="72" REF="380"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1761.</NOTE>retire to his own country,
whither he himself accompanied him. Thus ended the public transactions of
Ghazi ul Dien, who crowded into a few years of early youth more crimes and
abilities, than other consummate villains have done into a long life of
wickedness and treachery. Though he did not possess the Decan, the
fruits of his grandfather's uncommon crimes, he may truly be said to have
been the genuine heir of the parts and treasons of that monster of iniquity
and villainy.</P>
<P>The Mahrattors, when they entered Delhi, confined Shaw Jehan,
who had borne the title of royalty for a few weeks; and, to quiet the minds of
some Mahommedan omrahs, who aided them, raised to the throne Jewan Bucht,
the eldest son of prince Ali Gohar, who had by this time assumed the
title of Shaw Allum in Behar. But this young prince, had he even abilities to
reign, had now no subjects left to command; for he may be considered as the
image of a king, set up by way of insult in the midst of the ruins of his
capital.</P>
<P>Abdalla being informed of the desertion of the Jates, was
extremely desirous of repassing the Jumna, and to come to battle with the
Mahrattors. He, for this purpose, marched up along the bank opposite to the
enemy, to Kungipurra, a place of some strength, possessed by
Nizabat Chan, an independent Rohilla chief. The Persian summoned him to
surrender, which he refused, and the place was consequently taken by
assault, and the garrison and inhabitants put to the sword.—The
Mahrattors, at the same time, marched up upon the side of Delhi, and, too
confident of their own strength, permitted Abdalla, without opposition, to
cross the Jumna, by the ford of Ramra: but observing him more bold in his
motions than they expected, they became somewhat afraid, and intrenched
themselves at <PB N="73" REF="381"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1761.</NOTE>Karnâl, in the very
same ground which was occupied formerly by Mahummud Shaw, while Abdalla
chose the more fortunate situation of Nadir Shaw.</P>
<P>Both armies lay in their entrenchments, for twelve days,
skirmishing at times with small parties. Abdalla, in the mean time, found
means to cut off some Mahrattor convoys, with pro∣visions, and, by the
vigilance and activity of his Durannies, to prevent all supplies from coming
to the enemy's camp.—As famine began to rage among the Mahrattors, they
were necessi∣tated to march out of their lines, upon the 20th of Jemmad ul
Sani, 1174, and to offer battle to Abdalla, which he immediately accepted. The
first shock was extremely violent: the Mah∣rattors advanced with great
resolution, and charged Abdalla sword in hand with such vigor, that he
was upon the point of being driven off the field, when Suja ul Dowlat, well
known to the British in India, and Ahmed Chan Bunguish, the Patan chief of
Doab, fell upon the flank of the Mahrattors, with ten thousand
horse.—This circumstance immediately turned the scale of victory.
Abdalla recovered from his confusion, renewed the charge, and drove back the
enemy. Should we credit common report, fifty thou∣sand Mahrattors fell in
this action, and in the pursuit: but be that as it will, the battle was
extremely bloody, for all the ge∣nerals of the vanquished, excepting Malhar
Raw, who fled upon the first charge, were slain.</P>
<P>Abdalla, after having pursued the Mahrattors for the space
of three days, returned to Delhi. He wrote from thence letters to prince Ali
Gohar, who had proclaimed himself king in the pro∣vince of Behar, under the
title of Shaw Allum, requesting him to return to Delhi, and to take upon him
the management of the affairs of government. Shaw Allum was too prudent to 
<PB N="74" REF="382"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1761.</NOTE>trust himself in the
hands of Abdalla, and therefore that prince, whose affairs on the side of
Persia required his presence, confirmed Jewan Bucht<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The present emperor's eldest son.</NOTE> upon the throne of
Delhi, under the tuition of Nigib ul Dowla, from whom he exacted an annual
tribute. Abdalla, after these transactions, returned to Cabul.</P>
<P>No sooner had Abdalla evacuated Delhi, than the Jates
com∣menced hostilities against Nigib ul Dowla. They seized upon Camgar
Chan, Zemindâr of Ferochagur, and appropriated to themselves his wealth
and territory. The minister, upon this, took the field. The Jates advanced
against him, with a great army, under the conduct of their chief, Raja
Sourage Mull. The Jates being much superior to the force of Nigib ul Dowla,
became confident of success; so that, when the armies approached within a
few miles of one another, near Secundra, the Raja went carelessly out, with
some of his officers, upon a hunting party. Nigib ul Dowla, being informed of
this circumstance by means of his spies, immediately detached a party of
five hundred horse, under Seidu, a bold partizan, in quest of the Raja.</P>
<P>Seidu fell in with Sourage Mull, whose party consisted of
about three hundred. They engaged sword in hand, with great resolution on
both sides; but, at length, the Jates were cut off to a man, and the Raja's
head was brought to Nigib ul Dowla, who was then upon his march to attack the
enemy. The unex∣pected appearance of Nigib, in the absence of their prince
and best officers, struck the Jates with universal panic; when, at that
very instant, a horseman advancing at full speed, threw the Raja's head
into their line. This circumstance compleated their confusion, so that
Nigib ul Dowla defeated them with ease, and pursued them, sword in hand,
some crores from the field of battle.</P>
<P> <PB N="75" REF="83"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1762.</NOTE>The minister, after this
victory, returned to Delhi. But he had not long remained in that capital,
before Joahir Singh, the son and successor of Sourage Mull, hired
twenty thousand Mah∣rattors, under Malhar Raw, and advanced with all his
forces to Delhi. Nigib ul Dowla was not capable to cope with the Jates and
their auxiliaries in the field. He shut himself up in the city, where he
was besieged for three months, and at last reduced to great distress.
However, a handsome present to Malhar Raw saved him upon this critical
occasion. The Jates, finding them∣selves betrayed by their mercenaries,
were obliged to patch up a peace, and retire into their own country. These
transactions happened in the year 1175 of the Higera. Nigib ul Dowla has been
since frequently attacked by the Jates to the east, and the Seiks to the
west, but he still maintains his ground with great resolution and
ability.</P>
<P>But to return to the adventures of the prince Ali Gohar, who,
under the title of emperor, now reigns in the small pro∣vince of Allahabad:
we have already observed, that he, after parting with the Mahrattors, threw
himself upon Nigib ul Dowla at Secundra. He could not, however, prevail upon
that Omrah to take up arms in his favor, He, therefore, left Secundra, with a
small retinue of servants, who lived at their own expence, in hopes of
better days, with their prince. With these he arrived at Lucknow, one of the
principal cities of the province of Oud, where Suja ul Dowlat kept then his
court. Suja ul Dowlat re∣ceived the king with seeming great respect, and
paid him royal honors; but this was only the false politeness of an Indian
court; which is always less deficient in ceremony than in saith. It was not
the interest of Suja ul Dowlat, who, by the villainies of his father, the
infamous Seifdar Jung, had become an independent prince, to revive the power of
the empire, he therefore declined <PB N="76" REF="384"/> all connection with the
affairs of Ali Gohar. He, how∣ever, made him a Nasir of some elephants,
horses, and half a lack of roupees in money, and insinuated to him, to
leave his court.</P>
<P>Ali Gohar, in this distressed situation, turned towards
Alla∣habad. Mahummud Kuli Chan, at that time, possessed that city and
province. Mahummud received the prince with friend∣ship as well as respect;
for being a man of an enterprizing ge∣nius, he entertained great hopes of
raising himself with the for∣tunes of the Shaw Zadda<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Shaw Zadda literally signifies the king's son: a title by
which Ali Gohar was distinguished during the life of his father Allumgire
Sani.</NOTE>. After maturely deliberating upon the plan of their future
operations, it was resolved, that, instead of relieving the unfortunate
Allumgire from the tyranny of Ghazi at Delhi, they should endeavor to
possess themselves of the provinces of Bengal and Behar, the revenues
of which might enable them to support a sufficient army to restore the
power of the empire. Though the Shaw Zadda was the undoubted heir of the
empire, yet, to take away every pretence of right from Jaffier Ali Chan, whom
the British, on account of his villainies, had raised to the government of
Bengal, he obtained a private grant of the subaships of the three provinces
from his father at Delhi.</P>
<P>Every thing being now concerted, public orders were issued
to the neighbouring rajas and sogedars, to repair to the standard of the
Shaw Zadda; while Mahummud Kuli Chan raised all the troops of Allahabad.
Camgar Chan, one of the principal foge∣dars of Behar, Pulwan Singh, raja of
Budgepoor, Bulbidder, raja of Amati, and many other, both Hindoo and Mahomedan 
<PB N="77" REF="385"/> chiefs, obeyed the summons, and joined the prince.
Soldiers of fortune, in the mean time, stocked to him from all quarters, so
that Ali Gohar found himself soon at the head of sixty thousand
men.</P>
<P>In the month of Ribbi ul Sani, of the year 1173, the Shaw Zadda
marched from Allahabad towards Bengal. The parti∣culars of this war are well
known. Let it suffice to mention here, that the prince was unsuccessful
in all his attempts upon Bengal; and was, at last, obliged to surrender
himself to the commander of the British forces, at Geiah in Behar. He
re∣ceived intelligence, soon after, of the assassination of his
father at Delhi. He was accordingly proclaimed emperor at Patna; but nothing
being done for him, by the British, the unfortunate prince found himself
obliged to throw himself into the hands of Suja ul Dowlat, who, in the
absence of Kuli Chan, had seized upon the province of Allahabad. The
villainy of Suja ul Dow∣lat did not rest there: he invited Kuli Chan to a
conference, and basely assassinated him.</P>
<P>Suja ul Dowlat, having possessed himself of the king's
person, closely confined him. He, at the same time, mocked the un∣happy
man with a farce of royalty, and obliged him to ratify all grants and
commissions, which might serve his own purposes. Under the sanction
of these extorted deeds, Suja ul Dowlat made war upon the neighboring
states, in which, however, he was not very successful. When Cassim
Ali Chan was driven from the subaship of Bengal, Suja ul Dowlat joined him,
in order to re∣cover his government. He was defeated at Buxar, by the
British, and the king being, in his flight, left behind him, threw himself
a second time under our protection.</P>
<P> <PB N="78" REF="386"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1764.</NOTE>He hoped, now, that as Suja
ul Dowlat's dominions fell into the hands of the British, in consequence of
this victory, that they would confer them upon him. But the unfortunate prince
de∣ceived himself. He had no money, and consequently had no friends. Suja
ul Dowlat was still possessed of wealth: and the virtue of the
conquerors was by no means proof against temp∣tation. They restored to him
his dominions, and, by a mere mockery of terms, called injustice by the name
of generosity. A small part of the province of Allahabad was allotted to
the king, for a subsistence, and the infamous son of a still more
in∣famous Persian pedlar enjoys the extensive province of Oud, as a reward
for a series of uncommon villainies.—But the trans∣actions of the
BRITISH SUBAS in India, will furnish materials for a distinct history. We
shall not, therefore, break in upon that subject in this place; as to
mention them slightly would be, in some measure, detracting from the
fame, which those GREAT MEN have so justly acquired.</P>

<PB N="79" REF="387"/>
<HEAD>SECTION VI. Of the present State of HINDOSTAN.</HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1764.</NOTE>THE short sketch which
we have given in the preceding sections, of the History of Hindostan, may
serve to throw light on the decline of the great empire of the Moguls in that
part of the world. We saw it gradually shrinking into itself, till the
race of Timur are, at last, confined within the narrow limits of an
insignificant province. It must, however, be al∣lowed, that the uncommon
misfortunes of that family, proceeded no less from their own weakness,
than from the villainy of their servants. Had a man of parts succeeded the
debility of Mahum∣mud Shaw's government, the ancient glory of the empire might
have been still restored. The revolted subas were not, then, well
established in their independence; and the gallant resistance which
Abdalla met with, in the reign of Ahmed, shewed that the Moguls could still
defend themselves from foreign invasions.</P>
<P>This, like other great states, fell into pieces, more by
do∣mestic factions, than by foreign arms. Even the ministers of the
unfortunate Mahummud were men of parts; those who ma∣naged the affairs of
Ahmed were possessed of great abilities; and, in the reign of Allumgire
Sani, young Ghazi displayed an uncommon and enterprizing genius. But virtue
had fled from the land: no principle of honor, patriotism, or loyalty,
remained; great abilities produced nothing but great crimes; and the eyes of
individuals being wholly intent upon private advantage, the affairs of the
public fell into ruin and confusion.</P>
<P> <PB N="80" REF="388"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1764.</NOTE>As from the ruins of the
extensive empire of the Moguls, many independent governments have started
up of late years, it may not be improper, in this place, to take a cursory
view of the present state of Hindostan. To begin with the northern
provinces. We have already observed, that Candahar, Cabul, Ghizni,
Pishawir, with a part of Moultan and Sind, are under the dominion of Ahmet
Abdalla. That prince possesses also, upon the side of Persia, the
greatest part of Chorrassân and Seistan, and all Bamia, on that
of Tartary. Abdalla, in short, reigns over almost all the countries which,
formed the empire of Ghizni, before it descended from the moun∣tains of
Afganistân to Lahore and Delhi. It is highly pro∣bable that, as Kerim
Chan has settled the western Persia, he may soon extend the empire to
its ancient boundaries towards the east, and drive Abdalla into Hindostan;
so that a third dynasty of kings of India may arise from among the
Afgans.</P>
<P>The revenues of Abdalla are very considerable, amounting to
about three crores of roupees. But as he is always in the field, and maintains
an army of 100,000 horse, to defend himself from the Persians and
Tartars, he is in great distress for money. This circumstance obliges
him, not only to oppress his own sub∣jects, but also to carry his
depredations to foreign countries. During the competition of the seven
conspirators for the throne of Persia, Abdalla had little to fear from that
quarter. But as Kerim Chan has established himself, by the defeat and
death of his rivals, it is extremely probable, that Abdalla will soon feel,
as we have already observed, the weight of his arms, as Chorrassân
and Seistan are properly provinces of the Persian empire.</P>
<P> <PB N="81" REF="389"/> However, Abdalla is, at present, at
peace with Kerim, and has taken that favorable opportunity for invading
Hindostan. He had, in April 1767, defeated the Seiks in three different
actions, and advanced to Sirhind, about forty crores from Delhi, with an army
of fifty thousand horse. It is supposed that Nigib ul Dowla, who, in
the name of the present emperor's son, manages the affairs of Delhi, had,
as he himself was hard pres∣sed by the Seiks and Jates, called in
Abdalla, to take upon him the government. Nigib ul Dowla, by our best
intelligence, marched out of the city to meet his ally, with forty thousand
men. The armies lay in fight of one another, and they were busy in
negotiation, and in settling a plan for their future opera∣tions. Abdalla, in
the mean time, wrote circular letters to all the princes of India, commanding
them to acknowledge him KING OF KINGS, and demanding a tribute. Suja ul Dowlat,
in particular, had received a very sharp letter from him, upbraid∣ing him for
his alliance with INFIDELS, and demanding the im∣perial revenues, which that
suba had converted to his own use for some years back.</P>
<P>Such was the situation of the affairs of Ahmed Abdalla, by our
last accounts from Delhi. This prince is brave and active, but he is now in
the decline of life. His person is tall and ro∣bust, and inclinable to
being fat. His face is remarkably broad, his beard very black, and his
complexion moderately fair. His appearance, upon the whole, is majestic, and
expressive of an uncommon dignity and strength of mind. Though he is not
so fierce and cruel as Nadir Shaw, he supports his authority with no less
rigor, and he is by no means less brave than that extraor∣dinary monarch. He,
in short, is the most likely person now in India, to restore the
ancient power of the empire, should he assume the title of king of
Delhi.</P>
<P> <PB N="82" REF="390"/> The SEIKS border upon the Indian
dominions of Abdalla. That nation, it is said, take their name of SEIKS,
which signi∣fies DISCIPLES, from their being followers of a certain
philoso∣pher of Thibet, who taught the idea of a commonwealth, and the pure
doctrine of Deism, without any mixture of either the Mahommedan or Hindoo
superstitions. They made their first appearance about the commencement of
this century, in the reign of Bahadar Shaw, but were rather reckoned then a
parti∣ticular sect than a nation. Since the empire began to decline, they
have prodigiously increased their numbers, by admitting proselytes of all
religions, without any other ceremony than an oath, which they tender to them,
to oppose monarchy.</P>
<P>The Seiks are, at present, divided into several states,
which in their internal government are perfectly independent of one another,
but they form a powerful alliance against their neighbors. When they are
threatened with invasions, an assembly of the states is called, and a
general chosen by them, to lead their respective quotas of militia into the
field; but, as soon as peace is restored, the power of this kind of
dictator ceases, and he re∣turns, in a private capacity, to his own
community. The Seiks are now in possession of the whole province of
Punjâb, the greatest part of Moultan and Sind, both the banks of the
Indus from Cashmire to Tatta, and all the country towards Delhi, from Lahore
to Sirhind. They have, of late years, been a great check upon the arms of
Abdalla; and, though in the course of the last year they have been
unsuccessful against that prince in three actions, they are, by no means
subdued, but continue a severe clog upon his ambitious views in India.</P>
<P>The chief who leads at present the army of the Seiks, is
Jessarit Singh; there is also one Nitteh Singh, who is in great 
<PB N="83" REF="391"/> esteem among them. They can, upon an emergency,
muster 60000 good horse; but, though in India they are esteemed brave,
they chuse rather to carry on their wars by surprize and stratagem, than
by regular operations in the field. By their principles of religion and
government, as well as on account of national injuries, they are inveterate
enemies to Abdalla, and to the Rohilla powers.</P>
<P>To the east of the dominions of the republic of the Seiks lie
the countries which are possessed by the Rohilla Afgans. Nigib ul
Dowla, whose history is comprehended in the preceding sections, is, from
his power, as well as from the strength of his councils and his own bravery,
reckoned their prince. He possesses the city of Delhi, in the name of
the family of Timur, together with a considerable territory around it, on
both the banks of the Jumna, and his revenues amount to one crore of roupees.
He publickly acknowledges the unfortunate Shaw Allum, at Allahabad, king, and
allows a pension to his son Jewan Bucht, who, without any power, maintains
a kind of regal dignity at Delhi.</P>
<P>Nigib ul Dowla has been known, when hard pressed by his
hostile neighbors, to raise 60000 horse; but his revenues are not
sufficient to support one tenth part of that number. He continues to take
the held under the name of buckshi, or captain-general of the Mogul empire;
and though he has not the power, or per∣haps the inclination, to assist
the king, he keeps up a friendly correspondence with him, and, without any
necessity, prosesses obedience and a shew of loyalty.</P>
<P>Besides Nigib ul Dowla, there are chiefs of the Rohilla race,
who are perfectly independent; but when danger presses, they unite with him
their forces. The most respectable of these chiefs <PB N="84" REF="392"/>
is Hasiz Rhimut, who possesses a considerable district between
the rivers. The next to him, in power, is Doondi Chan; and with him we may
number Mutta Hussein, Jacob Ali Chan, Fatte Chan Zurein, and others of
less note, who command inde∣pendent tribes beyond the Ganges to the north of
Delhi.</P>
<P>The whole power of the Rohillas may amount to 100,000 horse,
and an equal number of infantry, upon an emergency; but these are so
wretchedly appointed and ill paid, that they furnish more of ridicule, than
they can impress of terror in the field. Their infantry are armed with
rockets, pointed with iron, which they discharge in vollies among cavalry,
which frighten more with their noise and uncommon appearance, than by the
execution which they make. The Rohillas are remarkable for nothing more than
their natural antipathy to the Mahrattors, which might be turned to advantage
by the British in their future views upon Hindostan: but the truth is, that
the Hindoos and Mahommedans so equally ballance one another in that country,
that by supporting one, we may, with great facility, command both.</P>
<P>There is a small government of the Patans to the east of the
Rohilla tribes. Their district is bounded by the dominions of the present
king, by those of Suja ul Dowlat, and by the terri∣tories of the Jates. The
capital of this petty principality is Fero∣chabad, which is situated upon the
banks of the Ganges, a few crores above the ruins of the celebrated city of
Kinnoge. Ahmed Chan Bunguish, who made a great figure against Seifdar Jung,
the father of Suja ul Dowlat, rules over this district. Ahmed is more
distinguished by his abilities and personal bravery, than by the extent
of his power. His revenues do not exceed fifty lacks; but he always keeps a
standing force of two or three thousand <PB N="85" REF="393"/> good horse,
which he pays well; and, upon an emergency, he raises all his vassals,
who consist of about 20000 men. His country is full of forts; and he has,
consequently, been hitherto able to defend himself against the
Mahrattors, Jates, and Suja ul Dowlat, who have respectively invaded his
dominions.</P>
<P>The city of Agra, and a very considerable tract of country
round it, extending along the Jumna, from forty crores below that city to
within five of Delhi, and stretching back to Gualier and Barampulla, are now
in the hands of a Hindoo nation, called the Jates. The raja who, commands the
Jates, is descended of the ancient race of the Jits, who possessed
the banks of the Indus, as far back as the reign of Sultan Mahmood of Ghizni.
From their prince, the whole body of the Jates, though made up of many
distinct tribes and sects, take their name; but others, with less
probability, trace it to JATE, which in the Hindoo language signifies a
labourer.</P>
<P>The Jates made no figure in the Mogul empire, as a nation, till
the reign of Allumgire, commonly known in Europe by the name of Aurungzebe. In
that monarch's expedition to the Decan, they were first heard of as a gang of
banditti, under an intrepid fellow, called Chura Mun. They were then so
daring as to harrass the rear of the imperial army. After the death of
Allumgire, the Jates took advantage of the growing imbecility of the empire,
and fortifying themselves among the hills of Narvar, spread their
depredations to the gates of Agra. Mokun Singh, who, after the death of Chura
Mun, commanded the Jates, took upon himself the title of Raja. Their power
increased under Bodun Singh and Sourage Mull, which last was dignified with
titles from the emperor.</P>
<P> <PB N="86" REF="394"/> Joahir Singh, the son of Sourage Mull,
now reigns over the Jates, and is a very weak prince. His revenues do not
exceed two crores of roupees; his dominions, like the rest of India, being
harrassed by the Mahrattors. He may, upon some occasions, be able to
bring into the field sixty or seventy thousand men, but he cannot keep
long in pay one third of that number. The dominions of the Jates abound with
strong fortresses, such as Dieg, Cumbere, and Aliver; in one of which
their prince frequently resides, though he spends the most part of his
time at Agra.</P>
<P>To the south-west of the Jates, Mudoo Singh, a rajaput raja,
possesses a very considerable territory, and resides for the most
part at Joinagur. He is the son of Joy Singh, a prince famous for his
knowledge in astronomy, and other mathematical sciences. He entertained
above a thousand learned brahmins for some years, in rectifying the
kalendar, and in making new tables for the calculation of eclipses, and for
determining the longitude and declination of the stars.—The revenues of
Mudoo Singh are not very considerable, being reckoned only eighty lacks; his
domi∣nions being woody, mountainous, and consequently ill cultivated. He can,
however, raise forty thousand men; and he himself is esteemed a good
soldier.</P>
<P>Bordering upon Mudoo Singh, upon the frontiers of the Decan, is
the extensive country of Marwar, ruled, at present, by Bija Singh, the
son of Bucht Singh, and grandson of Jessawind Singh. Marwar, when the
empire was in a flourishing condition, yielded annually five crores of
roupees: at present its revenues do not amount to half that sum, on account
of the incessant depredations of the Mahrattors, its next neighbours.</P>
<P>The next Hindoo government to Marwar, is that of Odipour. The
raja of this country is distinguished by the name of Rana. 
<PB N="87" REF="395"/> That prince, more from his nobility of family than from
his power, assumes a superiority over all the rajas of Hindostan. His
dominions were formerly very extensive, but, of late years, they have been
circumscribed within narrower bounds. His territories abound with mountains
and forests, and are almost sur∣rounded by the kingdoms of Malava and
Guzerat. His revenues are inconsiderable, and he cannot bring into the field
above fifteen thousand men.—In the vallies between the mountains of
Odipour, there are many petty independent rajas; Bundi, Cottu, Rupnagur,
Jesselmere, and Bianere, being governed by their respective princes, each
of whom can muster six or eight thou∣sand men.</P>
<P>The Mahrattors are the most considerable Hindoo power in
Hindostan. The principal seat of their government is Sattarah, and
sometimes Puna, on the coast towards Bombay. Though the genuine Mahrattors
all over India do not exceed 60000 men, yet, from their superior bravery and
success in depredation, thousands of all tribes enlist themselves
under their banners. These, instead of pay, receive a certain proportion of
the plunder. By this means an army of Mahrattors increases like a river, the
farther it advances; so that it is no uncommon thing for a force of ten or
twelve thousand genuine Mahrattors to grow into 100,000, before they arrive
in the place which they destine to plunder.</P>
<P>The present chief of the Mahrattors is Ragenot Raw, the son
of Bagiraw. He possesses one half of Guzerat, and all the territories
between that province and the Decan. He has, of late years, extended his
conquests to all the provinces of Malava, and to a part of Allahabad; having
reduced Himmut Singh, raja of Gualier, Anarid Singh, raja of Badawir, Anarid
Singh, of Chunderi, and the princes of Dittea, Orcha, Elichpoor, Bandere, 
<PB N="88" REF="396"/> and Jassey; all of whom have become tributary to the
Mahrat∣tors. They have, moreover, possessed themselves of Orissa,
which ought, in propriety, to be annexed to the subaship of Bengal,
according to the late grant of the king to the British. Thus the dominions of
the Mahrattors extend quite across the peninsula of India, from the bay of
Bengal to the gulph of Cambait or Cambay.</P>
<P>The amount of the revenues of the Mahrattors cannot easily be
ascertained. They must, however, be very considerable. They subsist
their armies by depredations on their neighbors, and are become the terror of
the East, more on account of their barbarity than their valour. They never
want a pretence for hostilities. They demand the Chout, or fourth part of the
reve∣nues of any province; and, in case of a refusal, they in∣vade,
plunder, and lay waste the country. Their horses be∣ing very hardy, their
incursions are sudden, unexpected, and dreadful. They generally appoint a
place of rendezvous, and their invasions are carried on by detached parties.
Should a considerable force at any time oppose them, they decline coming to
action; and, as they invigorate their hardy horses with opium, their flight,
like their incursions, is very expeditious.</P>
<P>The armies of the Mahrattors do not, like the troops of other
Indian powers, incumber themselves with bazars or markets. They trust for
their subsistence to the countries through which they march. They are
armed with firelocks, some with match∣lock guns, and others with bows,
spears, javelins, swords and dag∣gers. They have, within three years back,
made some advances towards forming a disciplined army of infantry. They
have, accordingly, at present, ten or twelve battalions of Seapoys, uniformly
cloathed and armed.—All the powers of India being now sensible of the
advantages which the British have gained by disciplined infantry, turn
their thoughts to a similar regulation in <PB N="89" REF="397"/> their armies,
and to improve their artillery, which was formerly too unweildy and
ill-mounted, to be of any service in the field.</P>
<P>To the east of Malava, and to the south of Allahabad, is the
country of Bundelcund, governed by Hindoput. His territories are of a
considerable extent and very fertile, and he moreover draws great wealth from
his diamond mines of Hieragur and Punagur. He also claims a right to the
mines of Sommelpour, but another raja possesses them at
present.—The annual revenues of Hindoput amount to near two crores of
roupees, including the profits arising from his mines. These he farms out
to merchant-adventurers, who purchase a certain number of superficial feet
of ground, and they are permitted to dig down perpendicularly as far as they
please. Diamonds beyond a certain weight are the property of the prince, who
has inspectors, to superintend the works.</P>
<P>The raja of Bundelcund possesses the impregnable
fortress of Callinger and several other considerable strong holds. He
has, notwithstanding, been obliged to compound for a certain tribute with the
Mahrattors, who generally paid him an annual visit. Between Bundelcund and
Cattack, in Orissa, lie the rajaships of Patna and Sommelpour, which are
not very considerable; the country being mountainous, woody, and unhealthy,
and the in∣habitants barbarous in every respect.</P>
<P>Part of the province of Allahabad is now possessed by
SHAW ALLUM, by birthright and title, though nothing less so in power,
emperor of Hindostan. He keeps the poor resemblance of a court at
Allahabad, where a few ruined Omrahs, in hopes of better days to their prince,
having expended their fortunes in his service, still exist the ragged
pensioners of his poverty, and burthen his gratitude with their presence.
The districts of Korah and Allahabad, in the king's possession, are
rated at thirty <PB N="90" REF="398"/> lacks, which is one half more than they
are able to bear. Instead of gaining by this bad policy, that prince,
unfortunate in many respects, has the mortification to see his poor
subjects oppressed by those who farm the revenue, while he himself is
obliged to com∣pound with the farmers for half the stipulated sum.
Besides the revenue arising from Allahabad and Korah, which we may at a
medium estimate at twelve lacks, the British pay to the king twenty-six
lacks out of the revenues of Bengal; which is all Shaw Allum possesses
to support the dignity of the imperial house of Timur.—It may not,
perhaps, be unacceptable to the public, to delineate, in this place, the
character of that unfortunate prince.</P>
<P>SHAW ALLUM is robust in his person, and about six feet
high. His complexion is rather darker than that which was common to the race of
Timur, and his countenance is expressive of that melancholy which naturally
arose from his many misfor∣tunes. He possesses personal courage;
but it is of the passive kind, and may be rather called fortitude to bear
adversity, than that daring boldness which loves to face danger.—He
has been so often dismounted in the course of ambition, that he now fears
to give it the rein; and seems less desirous to make any efforts to
retrieve the power of his family, than to live quietly under the shadow of
its eclipsed majesty.—His clemency borders upon weakness, and his
good nature has totally subverted his authority. He is daily induced, by
importunity, to issue out orders which he takes no means to inforce, and
which, he is certain, will not be obeyed. From this blemish in the character
of Shaw Allum, arose the half of his misfortunes; for the great secret of
establish∣ing authority, is to give no orders which cannot be inforced, and
rather to suffer small injuries, than shew resentment, without the
power of punishing.</P>
<P> <PB N="91" REF="399"/> His generosity is more than equal to
his abilities, and, too often, ill bestowed. He is too much addicted to
women, and takes more pains to maintain his Haram, than to support an
army.—But though we cannot call him a great prince, we must allow him
to be a good man. His virtues are many; but they are those of private life,
which never appear with lustre upon a throne. His judgment is by no means
weak; but his passions are not strong: the easiness of his temper is
therefore moulded like wax by every hand; and he always gives up his own better
opinion for those of men of inferior parts.—He is affable in his
conversation, but seldom descends to pleasantry. Upon the whole, though
Shaw Allum is by no means qualified to restore a lost empire, he might have
maintained it with dignity in prosperous times, and transmitted his name,
as a virtuous prince, to posterity. It is with great regret that the author,
from his regard to truth, cannot speak more favorably of a prince, to whom
his gratitude and attachment are due, for repeated testimonies of his
esteem and friendship.</P>
<P>The territories of Suja ul Dowlat, who possesses the
province of Oud, border upon those of the king. His revenues amount to near
two crores of roupees, out of which he pays nothing to the emperor, though he
pretends to recognize his title as his sovereign. Since his defeat at Buxar,
Suja ul Dowlat attends very much to the discipline of his army, and the
proper regu∣lation of his finances. He has already formed ten battalions of
Seapoys, and has made great improvements in his artillery. When the news of
Abdalla's late invasion came, he levied twelve thousand horse, upon a
better footing than is generally practised in Hindostan. He is now the ally
of the British in India, and as his revenues will never enable him to
support himself in the field against them, it is probable his principle
of <PB N="92" REF="400"/> fear, for he has none of honor or gratitude, will make
him stand to the letter of the treaty.</P>
<P>Suja ul Dowlat is extremely handsome in his person; about
five feet eleven inches in height, and so nervous and strong, that, with
one stroke of the sabre, he can cut off the head of a buffalo. He is
active, passionate, ambitious; his penetrating eye seems, at first
sight, to promise uncommon acuteness and fire of mind: but his genius is
too volatile for depth of thought; and he is consequently more fit for the
manly exercises of the field, than for deliberation in the
closet.—Till of late he gave little atten∣tion to business. He was
up before the sun, mounted his horse, rushed into the forest, and
hunted down tigers or deer till the noon of day. He then returned, plunged into
the cold bath, and spent his afternoons in the Haram among his
women.—Such was the bias of Suja ul Dowlat's mind till the late war.
Ambitious without true policy, and intoxicated with the passions of youth,
he began a wild career, in which he was soon checked. Stung with the loss
of reputation, his passions have taken another course. His activity is
employed in discipling his army, and he now spends more time at the
comptoir of his finances, than in dallying with the ladies of his seraglio.
His authority, there∣fore, is established, his revenues increased, and
his army on a respectable footing. But, with all his splendid qualities, he
is cruel, treacherous, unprincipled, deceitful: carrying a spe∣cious
appearance, purposely to betray, and when he embraces with one hand, will
stab with the other to the heart. Toge∣ther with being heir to the fruits of
his father's crimes, he in∣herits all his latent baseness of mind; for, if
we except personal courage, he possesses not one virtue more than
Seisdar Jung.</P>
<P>The province of Oud is situated to the north-east of the
Ganges, bordering upon Behar, from which it is, on the one side, divided by
the river Deo, or Gagera, and on the other by <PB N="93" REF="401"/> the
Carumnassa. The country is level, well cultivated and wa∣tered. It is
divided, on the north, by a chain of mountains from Thibet. In the vallies,
which intersect that immense ridge of hills, there are several
independent rajas, too inconsiderable to be formidable to Suja ul Dowlat.</P>
<P>The provinces of Bengal and Behar are possessed by the
British East-India company, in reality, by the right of arms, though, in
appearance, by a grant from the present emperor. This is not a proper place
to enter into particulars concerning those pro∣vinces: it may suffice to
observe, that Bengal and Behar, in∣cluding what is called the company's lands
and duties upon mer∣chandize, yielded in April, 1766, 33,025,968 Sicca,
roupees. The expences of government, the tribute to the king, and a pension
to a nabob, set up on account of the villainies of his father, amounted to
22,450,000 roupees, and consequently the ballance in favor of the company was
10,575,968 roupees, or 1,321,994l. 15s. of our money.—The British force
in Bengal consists of three battalions of Europeans, and thirty of Seapoys,
regularly armed, disciplined, and uniformly cloathed; so that we are much
superior, even upon that establishment, to any other power at present
in Hindostan.</P>
<P>In the Decan the British are almost as powerful as in
Bengal. We support Mahommed Ali, as nominal nabob of the Carnatic, while, in
fact, we govern the country without control, having the possession of
the garrisons and the disposal of the revenues. The power of the Nizam,
who resides at Hydrabad, though he possesses all the province of
Golconda, is, of late, very much circumscribed. He, however, still
maintains an army of 60 or 70000 men; but without discipline, and ill paid
they are by no means formidable. He, some time ago, entered into a treaty
with the British, but he has, of late, shewn no disposition to ad∣here
to it long.</P>
<P> <PB N="94" REF="402"/> Hydernaig, a soldier of fortune, who,
by his, personal merit, raised himself from a common Seapoy, to be
sovereign of almost all the coast of Malabar, threatened, last year, to
attack the Nizam, if he did not break his unnatural alliance with the
Bri∣tish. The part which the Nizam will take upon this occasion, will
entirely depend on the spirit of the councils of the British on the
coast.—As Hydernaig had also threatened Mahommed Ali, nabob of the
Carnatic, it was judged prudent to march an army against him in March, 1767;
but what success may have attended the expedition, has not hitherto reached
Europe.</P>
<P>Hydernaig is said to have thirty disciplined battalions of
Sea∣poys, twenty thousand good horse, and a great train of artillery,
wrought by five hundred European renegadoes. This prince having served in
person in European armies, models his troops upon their plan, pays
punctually, and enforces discipline with rigor. Together with being an able
politician, he is a daring, active, and impetuous soldier, and if he is not
immediately crushed, he may prove the most dangerous enemy that the
British have hitherto met with in the East. He is, at present, the most
for∣midable prince in all India, and he will, no doubt, take advantage of the
divided state of that country, and endeavor to extend his conquests.</P>
<P>Thus have we, in a few words, endeavored to give a general idea
of the present state of Hindostan. The reflexions which naturally arise
from the subject, might swell this work into a volume. It is apparent,
however, from what has been said, that the immense regions of Hindostan
might be all reduced by a handful of regular troops.—Ten thousand
European infantry, together with the Seapoys in the company's service, are
not only sufficient to conquer all India, but, with proper policy, to
main∣tain it, for ages, as an appendage of the British crown.—This
position may, at first sight, appear a paradox, to people unac∣quainted 
<PB N="95" REF="403"/> with the genius and disposition of the inhabitants of
Hindostan: but to those who have considered both with atten∣tion, the
thing seems not only practicable, but easy.</P>
<P>That slavery and oppression, which the Indians suffer
from their native princes, make the justice and regularity of a British
go∣vernment appear to them in the most favorable light. The great men of the
country have no more idea of patriotism, than the meanest slaves; and the
people can have no attachment to chiefs whom they regard as tyrants. Soldiers
of fortune are so numerous in India, that they comprehend one fourth of the
inha∣bitants of that extensive country. They are never paid one third of the
stipulated sum, by the princes of Hindostan, which renders them mutinous
and discontented; but they would most certainly approve themselves
obedient, faithful, and brave, in the service of a power who should pay
them regularly.</P>
<P>In a country like India, where all religions are tolerated, the
people can have no objection to the British, on account of theirs. The army
might be composed of an equal number of Mahom∣medans and Hindoos, who would
be a check upon one another, while a small body of Europeans would be a
sufficient check upon both. The battalions ought to be commanded altogether
by European officers, who, if they do their duty properly, and behave with
justice to their men, may attach them to their per∣sons, with stronger
ties than any troops born in Europe. But if justice is not observed to
soldiers, human nature, in this, as in all countries, will and must revolt
against oppression.</P>
<P>At present, the black officers of the Seapoys must rise
from the ranks. This is sound policy, and ought to be continued. Men of
family and influence are deterred, by this circumstance, from entering into
the service. These officers are, therefore, en∣tirely our creatures, and
will never desert a people, among whom <PB N="96" REF="404"/> alone they can
have any power; for no acquired discipline will give weight to a mean man,
sufficient to bring to the field an army of Indians.</P>
<P>The advantages of a conquest of Hindostan to this country
are obvious. It would pay as much of the national debt, as go∣vernment should
please to discharge. Should the influx of wealth raise the price of the
necessaries and conveniences of life, the poor, on the other hand, by being
eased of most of their taxes, would be more able to purchase
them.—But, say some grave moralists, how can such a scheme be
reconciled to justice and humanity?—This is an objection of no
weight.—Hindostan is, at present, torn to pieces by factions. All
laws, divine and human, are trampled under foot.—Instead of one tyrant,
as in the times of the empire, the country now groans under thou∣sands; and
the voice of the oppressed multitude reaches heaven. It would, therefore,
be promoting the cause of justice and hu∣manity, to pull those petty
tyrants from the height to which their villainies have raised them, and to
give to so many millions of mankind, a government founded upon the principles
of virtue and justice.—The task is no less glorious than it is
prac∣ticable; for it might be accomplished with half the blood which is often
expended, in Europe, upon an ideal system of a ballance of power, and in
commercial wars, which must be attended with little eclat, as they are
destitute of striking and beneficial consequences.</P>
