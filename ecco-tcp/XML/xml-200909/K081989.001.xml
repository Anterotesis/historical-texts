<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE Letters, which I have herewith the Honour and Happiness of
offer∣ing to the Public, were to me the volun∣tary Gift of an elegant Friend of
the late Mr. SHENSTONE; of a Friend, who, like myself, loved his private
Virtues, and ad∣mired his literary Abilities; and if the Va∣lue of such a
Gift could have received En∣hancement, it was effectually derived from the
polite Manner wherein it was presented. The following Extracts from some
Letters which accompanied them, will shew on what unreserved Stipulations I
received them, and consequently will (I hope) jus∣tify the Use I make of
them. 
<LETTER>
<HEAD>Extract the first, from a Letter dated 
<DATE>Nov. 9, 1775.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>I herewith perform my Promise; as I found the Letters in my
Bureau, so I <PB N="ii" REF="4"/> send them to you, having neither Time nor
Spirits to look them over. They are now your own, with full Permission to
apply them to any Purpose you think proper. I shall be glad if they
answer your Expectation. As <HI>some</HI> of them are those of a Friend
so highly valued, they will, with <HI>you,</HI> I know, have Merit, and, I
hope, with the <HI>World.</HI> Of the latter, however, you are the best
Judge, and to your Decision I implicitly trust them. I wish I could add
much more—the little I can, I will. PINDAR's Odes, VER∣NON's Poems, (with
Observations by Mr. SHENSTONE) and the <HI>Gentle Shep∣herd,</HI> were
<HI>all his,</HI> and as such I hope you will accept them, in Remembrance of
him. Besides the Letters which are tied up, the Parcel will contain Remarks
on MILTON's <HI>Paradise Lost,</HI> Copies of the Duchess of SOMERSET's
Letters, (transcribed by Mr. SHENSTONE<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"> These
particular Letters (I should presume) will unquestionably be allowed to
deserve the Character which Mr. SHENSTONE has prefixed to them in his
Transcript. It is as follows: 
<Q>Copies of Letters from her Grace the Duchess Dowager of
SOMERSET (formerly Countess of <HI>Hertford)</HI> in which is discernible a
perfect Rectitude of Heart, Delicacy of Sentiment, and a truly-classic
Ease and Elegance of Style. There are many of them tinged with an Air of
Melancholy, thro' the Loss of her only Son, Lord BEAUCHAMP.</Q></NOTE>) and 
<PB N="iii" REF="5"/> bound in Vellum, three loose in the Leaves, (her Grace's
own Hand-Wri∣ting) the <HI>Scotch</HI> Fragments, and a little Memorandum-Book,
over which, per∣haps, you will like to spend Half an Hour, though it contains
nothing but <HI>Names.</HI></P>
</LETTER> Again, in a Letter, dated <HI>April</HI> 4, 1776. 
<LETTER>
<P>Have you seen, or heard from Mr. —? Have you yet got,
or are you like∣ly to get, that Letter of the Duchess of SOMERSET's which was
missing? I hope so—May Success attend you! When the whole is
digested and revised, I have no Doubt of its being valuable.</P>
</LETTER></P>
<P>This explicit Disclosure of the liberal Means, by which
these Letters came into <PB N="iv" REF="6"/> my Hands, will, I presume,
confirm the Authenticity of them, if they can be sup∣posed to stand in
Need of such Confirma∣tion; I say, <HI>if they can,</HI> for surely they
possess indubitable Marks of Originality, and require no adventitious
Evidence to support them.</P>
<P>Being thus possessed of such an unlimited Power, my
first Care was to make the most cautious and delicate Use of it. I have
ac∣cordingly suppressed all entire Letters, as well as distinct
Passages, which appeared to contain Matter improper for public
Inspec∣tion; all, in Fact, which might be liable (in the slightest
Degree) to Misconstruction, either relative to the Writer, or the Party
addressed, or that might awaken unwelcome Feelings in the Breast of any
surviving Friend or Relation. I have likewise, where a Correspondent is
introduced, or other Per∣son alluded to, who may be still alive, (tho'
most of the Correspondents, I am convinced, are dead) I have, I say, on
such Occasions, preserved only Initials of the Names, in order that
public Curiosity should be no <PB N="v" REF="7"/> further gratified than
might be agreeable to the Parties concerned.</P>
<P>After what I have advanced to prove the nice Precaution I have
taken, does this pleasing, and, at the same Time, useful Undertaking of
mine stand in Need of an Apology?—I hope not.—I flatter myself,
the very Persons, to whose Situations I have alluded in the foregoing
Paragraph, will confess, it does not. Not to say a Word of my own
Principles, I affirm that the bare Idea of a Publication, wherein Mr.
SHENSTONE's Talents are displayed, or wherein even his Name is mentioned,
would deter me from advancing one Step beyond the Bounds of Propriety and
Decorum.</P>
<P>Yet, notwithstanding all I have said in Self-Justification,
I know there are some very peculiar (if I dared, I would call them
<HI>over-nice)</HI> Persons, who alledge, that no private Letters should be
made public, with∣out the Consent of the Writers of such Let∣ters. This I
will readily allow to be a good <HI>general</HI> Rule, but, like many others,
may <PB N="vi" REF="8"/> admit of an Exception, in particular In∣stances; and
these Instances are, where a <HI>proper Mode</HI> of introducing them to
the World is inviolably attended to. It is a well-known, and equally
uncontrovertible, Maxim, that Persons of the highest Ex∣cellence
(especially in the literary Walk) are possessed of the greatest
Reserve and Diffidence. Were the private Sentiments of such to be with-held
from the Public, till their individual Consent were obtained, what a Loss
would it be to the Republic of Letters, and what an Injury to moral
Im∣provement! Any Person's general Princi∣ples and Ideas may be seen,
perhaps, in the respective public Profession and Situation of Life, and
their general Intercourse with Mankind; but the innate Sensations, the more
refined Emanations of the Mind, are alone discoverable in the private
Com∣munications of Friendship. There can therefore be no unpardonable Liberty
in <HI>de∣coying,</HI> or even <HI>gently-compelling</HI> such De∣servers
into public Notice; nor is it, by any Means, uncharitable to suppose, there
may be many, who would not be violently displeased to see their
Sentiments in Print, <PB N="vii" REF="9"/> however reluctant they might, and,
per∣haps, ought to appear, if their particular Permission were applied
for.</P>
<P>To illustrate and enforce this Position, let me be permitted
to ask, if the Duchess of SOMERSET had been requested to have suf∣fered
her Letters to be made public, whe∣ther she would have consented? Probably
not—Yet what an Advocate would moral Virtue, pious Resignation, and
genuine Piety have been deprived of, if those exqui∣site Transcripts of
her Mind had been con∣cealed from public View!—It is, moreover, Matter of
great Doubt, whether we should have been so well acquainted with the
Ta∣lents of a SHENSTONE, had Providence in∣dulged the Wishes of his most
intimate Friends and Acquaintances, in prolonging so valuable a Life.</P>
<P>Thus it has been, is, and will be, with most People of
distinguished Abilities; their Excellencies must, in a Manner, be
<HI>forced</HI> into Day-light, or we should lose the Bene∣fit of their
Precepts; they might otherwise be said, like Misers, to have a valuable
Trea∣sure <PB N="viii" REF="10"/> buried with them, which ought, in common
Justice, to be left behind for the Advantage of Survivors.</P>
<P>I have, I doubt, been too prolix; but the Fear of offending, or,
at least, a Desire to wipe off the Stain of such an <HI>Intention,</HI>
has led me into it. I hope, I stand excul∣pated; and now beg only to
conclude, with sincere Thanks to the Gentleman, who po∣litely obliged me with
Letter XXVII. of the Duchess of SOMERSET's, and my most grate∣ful
Acknowledgements to the first men∣tioned Friend, who conferred on me the
ele∣gant Pleasure of conveying to the Public some few more Excellencies of
that benevo∣lent Man whose living Talents I admired, and whose Memory I
revere.</P>

<TAILNOTE>
<P>{inverted ⁂}The accurate Reader will discover some Letters
erroneously placed in Point of Date, owing principally to some Copies not
being received early enough for their proper Situations; but as no Chain of
Events is inter∣rupted thereby, it is hoped the Error may easily be
ex∣cused.</P>

<P>I AM sorry to put you to an Expence for a trifling Letter at this
Distance. It seems too, to give you leave to expect some∣thing
extraordinary, or uncommon. Whatever is so in my Letters, I am sure, must
be on the bad Side. I may however have the greater Power to convince you, that
Distance is in∣capable to separate you from my Thoughts.</P>

than to live over again the Pleasures of <HI>Oxford</HI> and your Com∣pany.
You might convey me a Letter full, would you be so exceedingly good as your
Promise. I am vastly self-interested, for I write only in order to beg
a Letter from you, with very small Hopes of your receiving much Plea∣sure
from mine.</P>
<P>I should here give you an Account of the Pleasures we have had
at M—, but my Paper won't contain it. There was one only wanting,
<HI>pour le comble</HI>—you'll be the last to find it out—your
Company. I aim at render∣ing my Letters as odd and fantastical as
possi∣ble; but when I write to a Person of your elegant character, my
Compliments degenerate into downright Truths, just (I was going to say) as
the Sun turns bad Wine to Vinegar; but downright Truths are sometimes
valuable, though a Person of your Taste might reason∣ably expect more
refined—at least less obvious ones. Sometimes, however, Vinegar has
also <PB N="3" REF="21"/> its Use, though to treat a Gentleman with it
entirely may well create a <HI>Nausea.</HI> I fancy my poignant Simile grows
stale by this Time. I write to an Intimate, and a Man of Sense, whose
Good-nature will forgive what his Judg∣ment may find fault with.</P>
<P>I hope your Ring gives you all imagina∣ble Happiness, however
fatal it may prove to female Ken. I suspect to hear of you as the finest
Performer on the Spinnet in the World. Were I a Poet, I should be highly
pleased to celebrate the admirable Conduct of your little Finger—

are, I assure you, a vast Part of my Pleasure at <HI>Oxford,</HI> as
POPE is in the Country; indeed, you might share that Effect with Mr. POPE,
would you write. It is a Favour, for which I must grow importunate;
notwithstanding <PB N="4" REF="22"/> which, the Favours I have already
received, would make me uneasy, were I not conscious who bestows
them.</P>
<P>Of all the moral Virtues, Gratitude is sure the most beautiful;
so far from betraying any Thing mean or ignoble in her Behaviour, she has
an Air which naturally discovers her Qua∣lity.—I can't stay to
describe her now—It is sufficient that I pay some Sort of Tribute
to her, when I call myself Mr. D—'s</P>

<HEAD>LETTER II. W. SHENSTONE, Esq. to Miss G—.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Sent 
<DATE><HI>Oct.</HI> 30, 1736.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE sent the Patterns, though with far less Expedition than
you might expect from one so entirely yours. The truth is, I was sensible
how insupportable the Transition must be from your Company to none at
all, so contrived to pay several Visits immediately after I had left
M—. You'll guess how suffi∣cient a Mortification I found even thus.
To pass from yours to the Company of dull Aunts and Cousins must needs
prove tedious, as the Reverse would be agreeable.</P>
<P>As to the Draughts, I am satisfied in what a ridiculous Light they
must appear; it was a Task I was very much unused to, and solicited
rather out of an officious Fondness to be em∣ployed for you, than any Skill I
was conscious of in myself. I must beg Mr. G—'s Pardon for engaging
in a Work, wherein he is far <PB N="6" REF="24"/> my Superior. Such as they are,
I beg you would believe they are the best I am capable of. I would rather
have my Judgment than Care censured, in any Thing I am employed in for you.
You'll be surprized to find them joined with a Paper scrawl'd over with
dull Poetry: however, I must confess, as I wrote it to please myself, I
sent it, not without Hopes that it might, in an inferior Manner, please
you. One may sometimes amuse one's-self with what one can't entirely
approve. As I can't flatter myself, your Judgment can excuse, so I can't
apprehend your Good-nature will ex∣pose me. To vindicate my Character to you,
as a Poet, I shall only join these alleviating Circumstances; First,
that nothing makes so aukward a Figure in Verse (as well as in some other
Respects) as Sincerity. Secondly, that these Lines were wrote when I had no
great Flow of Spirits, namely, when I had just left M—, and you; but I
shall want your Patience elsewhere, so will say no more about
'em—only this—that I should not have mentioned Miss L—,
were I not persuaded that, as you are entirely free from the other Faults of
your <PB N="7" REF="25"/> Sex, so you are from that of not bearing to hear
another commended. It is a Sign of a great Want of Accomplishments, when a
Per∣son is continually suspicious of being rivalled; and, for that Part,
you may give every One many more than their Due, without the least Danger of
being so.</P>
<P>I could not help envying WHISTLER's Hap∣piness, when I came away;
I fancy your Lives have been a constant Round of Delights; I don't know any
Neighbourhood more likely to produce 'em. I could reconcile myself, how∣ever,
pretty well to <HI>Harborough</HI>'s melancholy Scenes, were I not conscious
of such superior Pleasures, <HI>où vous sçavez.</HI> You
might convey me a Letter full of them, but you'll, perhaps, think it an
impertinent Request. I could set what Value you please on the Favour,
though the Pleasure I can't pretend to limit.</P>
<P>I must now break off my Letter in as auk∣wark a Manner as I take
my Leave, which is likewise usually most aukward, where I have most
Respect. I'll e'en lay aside further Cere∣mony <PB N="8" REF="26"/> in this,
as in the other Case, and say no more than that I am,</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU express so great a Concern for my Brother's Illness, that
not only common Civility, but Humanity, obliges me to acquaint you, that he is
upon the Recovery. His Phy∣sicians have thought him out of Danger these
three Weeks, as to his Fever, but are appre∣hensive of a Consumption; to
prevent which, they have ordered him a Milk-Diet, as soon as 
<PB N="9" REF="27"/> he gets into the Country, which he hopes to do, some Time
next Week. My Brother G— is with him. To make the Journey easy, they
propose to hire a Chaise, and make three or four Days of it.</P>
<P>DICK has been so compassionate to write to me twice; the
First was only to shew me he was alive; in the last Letter he seems to
have recovered his usual Spirits, and says, he must be obliged to the
most despicable Creature in the Universe for the most valuable
Blessing in Life. He is quite determined to leave the Study of Physick,
and turn Friar, which I am delighted at, as I believe it will be conducive to
his Health.</P>
<P>I think I have been very particular in my Account of my Brother,
which you would have received last Post, but that I was from Home when
yours came, and did not return till late on Saturday Night. I write this in the
greatest Hurry, for Company waits for me to set out for S—: but I
must tell you, that I am very angry you should think so meanly of me, as
to imagine I had not Generosity enough to <PB N="10" REF="28"/> send you an
Account of my Brother and your Friend, without the Bribe of a Compliment. Out
of Regard, however, I must pardon you.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I THINK it would be inconsistent with Gra∣titude, as well as
Good-manners, not to return you Thanks for the Pleasures your Wri∣tings have
given me; but I shall desist from <PB N="11" REF="29"/> declaring my
Sentiments of them, lest you should stile it Flattery. Writing has been
my constant Employ (when at Home) ever since you left us, and I hope you
could not expect them sooner. I could not but think Fate doubly cruel, (when
to part us was as much as we <HI>here</HI> could bear with Decency) to embroil
us still more by the Hurt of the Leg, which I am glad to hear is got
well.</P>
<P>With you fled all Life and Spirit from A—; a total Eclipse
succeeded you, and the Sun will shine no more till your <HI>bright
Influence</HI> dispels the Cloud. Company and Fruit come in of∣ten, but all
in vain, for nothing has any Re∣lish, but the Writings of him who caused
the Malady. You have shone so much to the Prejudice of our Neighbours, that
it is with Difficulty we behave with tolerable Decorum. We drink your Health as
constant as Appetite (or rather, Custom) calls to Table, for nothing has
any Taste, except the Glass, in which you are named.</P>
<P>We sent <HI>Tom Thumb</HI>'s Performance (I think in my Heart it
is Nonsensense) to Mr. —, who <PB N="12" REF="30"/> read it, called
him <HI>nasty Dog,</HI> and put it in his Pocket. Whether it will be a
Spit-Cat, or dumb Madness, I don't know; but I am sure the bottled
Small-Beer was very brisk last <HI>Sunday.</HI></P>
<P>From <HI>August</HI> 25th we date our Misery; no Smile seen,
or Laugh heard since, till last Night.—What could cause one
then?—Why, Mr. SHENSTONE, who had been dumb so long, spoke then, and
who can hear him without being pleased? It is meet and right, as well as
highly pleasing to Mrs. MARY, that you should respect Mr. A—, who,
I believe, in∣tends to spend his last Breath in your Praise, but he'll
make your Name glorious. Nothing could give him more Pleasure than you have
done, except a Present of Lawn-Sleeves. As to the Scheme you mention, I dare
not bid you hope, but I will venture to bid you not de∣spair, on a
Presumption that your Rhetorick can never fail of Success.</P>
<P>I can't prevail with my Sisters for a Letter a-piece. One says,
that you shall be the next Gentleman she writes to. Mrs. A— says,
tho' <PB N="13" REF="31"/> you cut off your Hair, she believes your Ears will
remain, and wishes nothing so much as an Opportunity to pinch 'em. Miss
K— says, she has already suffered too much by <HI>that Ty∣rant,
Love,</HI> ever to engage with Mankind more, not even Mr. SHENSTONE; but cannot
bear that Miss D— should be so happy. S— says, she would
make a handsome Speech, but cannot, and therefore sends you <HI>only
Service.</HI> My Brother desires his Compliments, and says, he can't fix a
Time for seeing <HI>the Leasowes,</HI> but designs to be at
<HI>Broom</HI> with your Brother, in Three Weeks Time. So here you have <HI>the
Sayings of the A—ians.</HI> But I have not done yet, till I have been a
little more troublesome.</P>
<P>Note. If I did not know you to be a good Judge of Mankind, and had
not experienced your Good-nature, (which inclines you to ex∣cuse the Foibles
of the <HI>weaker Vessel)</HI> together with the Hopes, that, for the Sake
of some happy Favourite, you would not expose the Sex, I should not have
trusted you with my Nonsense. This concludes, therefore, with de∣siring
one Favour, which is, that you would <PB N="14" REF="32"/> burn this, and that
the Flame and my Folly may die together; and be assured you'll oblige</P>

<P>ON a Time, as 'tis reported, the Moun∣tains were in Labour; when,
after a long Course of Pains and Inquietudes, they made a shift to produce
that puny Animal, a Mouse. <PB N="15" REF="33"/> Now that very individual
Mouse, according to the mysterious and figurative Import of Types and
Shadows, was the perfect Image and Re∣presentative of this mine Epistle. A
groveling, starveling, insignificant Production, conceived with much
Difficulty, and transmitted to you with Confusion of Face. In short, you
may look upon it as the noble Booty you have taken, by baiting your
<HI>Trap</HI> so artfully with Praise and Compliment, about two or three
Months ago. True it is, that, considering the Politeness and Complaisance
of your obliging Letter, my Behaviour since must appear the most
<HI>unknightly</HI> of all Proceedings, But your Packet did not arrive till
three Weeks after it was sent; so you will excuse my Silence till the Day
after I received it, and whatever was <HI>more</HI> than that, I freely
acknowledge, came of Sin. However, you will, upon Confession, par∣don me,
as you expect Pardon from your Con∣fessor, should the Benedictines and
Friars get a Footing in this Island, which I find your Brother is
endeavouring to prevent.</P>
<P>I can be no longer ludicrous on this last Article. I am too
seriously concerned for his <PB N="16" REF="34"/> Safety; yet I don't fear
but the Rebels will be defeated, and, it may be, all Danger over in less than
a Fortnight. But General WADE's Behaviour, loitering so long at
<HI>Newcastle,</HI> asto∣nishes me. I was at <HI>Birmingham</HI> on
<HI>Tuesday</HI> Morning, from whence I saw the Remains of LIGONIER's
Horse march with vast Spirits and Alacrity. They wish to have, what they
call, the <HI>Refusal</HI> of the <HI>Highlanders.</HI> They are Men of
experienced Bravery, and fought like Furies at the Battle of <HI>Fontenoy.</HI>
May they do so now, and with better Success!</P>
<P>B— told me, your Brother would borrow my Pistols. At that
Time, supposing him in Jest, I sent him no very serious Answer. I
now think it incumbent on me to say, that I would lend them him with all my
Heart, but that one of them is broke in the Stock, and cannot be fired with
Safety till it is stocked afresh. Perhaps he might recollect it was so
when I was at A—.</P>
<P>We have been best Part of a Week at <HI>Litchfield,</HI> where we
lived like Chickens in a Pen, confined and crammed, and where we 
<PB N="17" REF="35"/> served God after the Manner of Popes and
Cardinals.—I only allude to Cathedral Service. Mr. and Mrs. D—
seemed quite disposed to entertain us agreeably. The Son and Daugh∣ter,
to say the least, appeared much more indifferent in that Particular. 
<Q REND="inline">"These,"</Q> as SHAKESPEARE says, 
<Q REND="inline">"are certainly better Christians, or else, are
worse than we."</Q></P>
<P>You have escaped me at <HI>Birmingham,</HI> by concealing the Time
of your Visit. Surely, you will come over to <HI>Broom,</HI> ere it be long,
and give me my Revenge.</P>
<P>Tell Mrs. A—, my Ears make great Shoots, and such as may
tempt her Hand egregiously: but if I <HI>am</HI> metamorphosed into an
Ass entirely, I will come and serenade her in a Morning, when she has
been up late the Night before.</P>
<P>I beg my Compliments to all Friends. I must not make my Letter
much longer—the Mouse will else grow to the Size of a Rat. I beg you
to accept this idle Billet in Part of an Answer to your elegant Letter, and
in Lieu <PB N="18" REF="36"/> of a thousand Professions of the

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>Jan.</HI> 21, 1745-6.</DATE></DATELINE> 
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE several Times examined myself, to find out what can
authorize or qualify me to write to Poets and Men of Letters. Upon strict
Enquiry, I am sensible, that nothing I am possessed of, can entitle
me to it, and no∣thing but Vanity and Selfishness could spur 
<PB N="19" REF="37"/> me on to this Impertinence; Vanity, in being addressed
by a Man of your Capacity and Fi∣gure in the World, and Selfishness, as I
am sure to be a Gainer by your Correspondence. I must, however, tell you,
the Epithets of art∣ful, polite, and witty, I have no Right to. In these
Respects, I am an Heroine of your own making, but I attribute all this to the
Con∣sequence of that great and generous Mind of your own, and in whose
Nature it is to ima∣gine you see in others what you really possess
yourself.</P>
<P>I shall not trouble you with a Detail of the Frights, Fears, and
dreadful Apprehensions, almost every body has been under, concerning the
Devil, the Pope, and the Pretender; 'tis my good Fortune to have more of that
strength∣ening Ingredient, called Hope, than that of the destructive one,
called Fear, in my Composi∣tion, which has prevented my suffering so much
upon the Occasion, as the rest of my Neigh∣bours. For my own Part, I had
but one Fear, which was that of my Brother's march∣ing; but I was soon made
easy in that Parti∣cular, <PB N="20" REF="38"/> when I found the
<HI>Duke</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Duke of CUMBERLAND, second Son to King
GEORGE the Second, who headed the Forces against the Rebels.</NOTE> had no
Occa∣sion for, nor would accept of, the new-raised Regiments. All the
neighbouring Gentlemen, who had not Commissions, went Volunteers in Captain
WHITMORE's Company, but are all come Home again, and begin to think they have
been upon a Don QUIXOTE Expedition, or have done like the King of
<HI>France,</HI> and his Forty-thousand.</P>
<P>All the Females are turned Politicians, except myself. I
bestowed two Minutes and an half in considering whether I should affect
to appear one or not. In the first Minute, my Thoughts suggested to me,
that there never would be a Parliament of Women; in the second, I was
convinced, if that should happen, it was mo∣rally impossible I should
ever have a Seat in the House; and the last Half-minute confirmed me in my
Resolution, not to meddle with Po∣litics, which, I imagine, was never
designed a Province for Women. I shall therefore be content till they act
in their proper Sphere, <PB N="21" REF="39"/> and Ribbons, and Fans, (which are
better adapted to my Capacity) are again their Theme.</P>
<P>What shall I say, as to neighbouring Oc∣currences? Your Friend,
Mr. A—, is very well, and often talks of you. He told me, last Time I
was in his Company, he designed him∣self the Pleasure of calling on you
in his Way to <HI>B—,</HI> early in the Spring. Meeting with
<HI>bright</HI> B— the other Day, I desired him to stir up his
Muse, to <HI>whip</HI> her, and <HI>lash</HI> her, and put forth
something upon the Times. A Gen∣tleman, who sat by, replied, 
<Q REND="inline">"Perhaps he may ruin himself in Whip-cord, before
he rouses her."</Q> The <HI>Brobdignags</HI> go on with their Knotting, as
usual; but I don't find that your <HI>favourite</HI> Miss D—
designs you any for a Waistcoat.</P>
<P>It was not in my Power to give you more Notice of my Visit to
<HI>Birmingham</HI> than I did, as the Time was not fixed above six Days
be∣fore I set out, in which Time my Brother went to <HI>B—,</HI> and
desired Mr. D— to let you know, when he saw you, (which he said
would be in a Day or two) you would think you had <PB N="22" REF="40"/> Revenge
enough, if you knew how I was dis∣appointed. At last, <HI>I sighed within
myself,</HI> and said, 
<Q REND="inline">"Surely, the Favour is more than I can
merit."</Q></P>
<P>I shall now <HI>cry aloud,</HI> and say, <HI>Wo unto them</HI>
that forget their Promise, for therein is their Fidelity called in
Question!—<HI>Wo unto them</HI> that erase out of their Letters what
they had written, for thereby they injure the Brain of <HI>her</HI> that would
find it out!—<HI>Wo unto them</HI> that are three Months in answering a
Letter, for surely it must tire the Patience of <HI>her,</HI> who is, all
that Time, in Expectation!—<HI>Woful Truths!</HI></P>
<P>S— <HI>the Valiant</HI> desires his Compliments, and thanks
you for the Offer of your Pistols, which Favour he never asked, as he did
not imagine they should fight with Pistols. He has been at Home this Month
recruiting. I don't doubt but the <HI>Shropshire Fusileers</HI> will make a
great Figure in military History—at least, in the <HI>Prints.</HI>
The tender, the wild, the grave, and the mild, all lump their Compli∣ments.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="41"/>By the Time you come to this Place, (which,
without a double Share of Patience, you will never arrive at) you must be
greatly disap∣pointed, as you'll then find the Sum Total of all I have said
amounts to Nothing: but don't then blame Nature, Education, or the Stars that
presided at my Birth, that I'm not a No∣velist, nor capable of saying any
Thing that can possibly entertain you herein, but <HI>rather</HI> blame
your own wrong Choice in a Correspon∣dent. I will now, out of Compassion
to you, put an End to this unparalleled Piece of Non∣sense, by wishing

<DATE><HI>March</HI> 19, 1745-6.</DATE></DATELINE> 
<SALUTE>Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT can't possibly be otherwise, than that I shall soon
arrive at the Pinnacle of the Tem∣ple of Vanity, in full Persuasion of the
just and deserved Encomiums on my Letters. In the Name of all that's
sincere and honest, let me prevail with you to leave off Flattery, and act
the Plain-Dealer; and let it suffice, when I tell you, that the grand
Compliment of all is, that you think my Letters worthy an An∣swer, which
alone is sufficient to feed my Vanity.</P>
<P>Now, lest you should not immediately re∣collect the fatal
Consequences, that may attend Flattery, from a Person one may chance to
have a good Opinion of, imagine that you see me intoxicated to the greatest
Degree that weak Woman is capable of; in order to which, <PB N="25" REF="43"/>
you are to suppose that I have taken it into my Head, that the House I
live in, is not em∣bellished with Ornaments and Decorations fit for me to
inhabit; that the Meat I eat is too coarse for my delicate Constitution,
and Orto∣lans alone fit for my Palate; that the Conver∣sation of my own
Family is quite despicable; my Neighbours not worth my Notice; that the Air
is not pure enough for me to breathe; in fine, that I am a <HI>celestial
Creature,</HI> far su∣perior to the Race of Mortals on Earth. And, should
this happen, you must then smite your Breast, and say, 
<Q REND="inline">"Alas! these are the Effects of
Flattery!—Which shall deter me from the Practice of it upon Womankind
for the future."</Q> I know 'tis a received Maxim with most Men, that no
Woman can be pleased without Flattery; but why might there not be an
Exception to this Rule? If my Letters are polite, 'tis what I never designed;
nor do I think you could possibly expect they should be so, from a
little Garret, in a Corner of a House, in a Corner of the World; and from one
who has nothing more to boast of, than the common Gifts of Nature, without
any other <PB N="26" REF="44"/> Assistance than what proceeds from her
Hand∣maid <HI>Time.</HI></P>
<P>As to your Dispute with Mr. B—, 'tis so like that between
the <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Persians,</HI> that I fancy it won't be determined
soon. For my own Part, tho' the Fighters have done little, I am inclined to
think the Writers have done less; for, as yet, I have not seen one Line in
the poetical Way, but what a B— may rival; and as to historical Facts,
I think they hang much upon Uncertainties. As it probably will be demanded of
every true Englishman, what he has done in Defence, or to the Honour of his
Country, I would fain know, if you are provided with an hundred Pages to throw
in the Teeth of any one who shall ask you the Question.</P>
<P>We are going to have some new Neighbours at <HI>W—d</HI>;
they are Sisters in Law to old Mrs. D—T; perhaps, as compleat a Pair of
old Maids as <HI>England</HI> can produce. The youngest is past Sixty, and
yet the Lungs of of the eldest are so good, that I'll be answer∣able
she shall harangue ten Hours together, <PB N="27" REF="45"/> upon the
Subject of Matrimony. She will scarce allow St. PAUL in the Right, when he
says, 
<Q REND="inline">"They that marry do well;"</Q> but is thoroughly
persuaded of the Truth of his next Assertion, 
<Q REND="inline">"They which don't marry do bet∣ter."</Q> The
youngest is not so fluent with her Tongue, but she, like the Welchman's
Owl, <HI>pays it off with thinking.</HI> I fancy we shall be able, in a
little Time, to furnish out a consider∣able Society of old Maids, whereof
Mrs. L— (which is the Name of one of the above-men∣tioned Ladies) shall
be Lady-President.</P>
<P>The <HI>Amazonian Mrs.</HI> A— will not own that she envies
Mrs. M—; but I have a great Sus∣picion, that she intends to rival
JENNY CAME∣RON, being equally fond of Wisdom, to which I may add, some
Ambition to out-shine her in the Field. She has practised frequently on one
or other of the Family this Winter, by which Means it has been my Fate, more
than once, to lye in Honour's Truckle-bed. I believe she designs to do
great Feats in War this Spring.</P>
<P>I am vastly pleased with the Conversation of your Tenants, and
laughed immoderately <PB N="28" REF="46"/> when I came to JOHN W—R's
Witticism. I don't intend to appear in Print, till I am well assured I
shall rival Mrs. — <HI>(A. P.)</HI> with her COPE, WADE, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Mr. PITT has resigned his Post in the Army, and recommended one
of his Nephews in his Room; not Mr. B—, I believe, for I don't hear that
he intends <HI>to boil his Lobster.</HI>—I love a genteel Phrase.

did not insist upon my Oath. He told me, he had, before this Time, done
himself that Pleasure, had not Illness pre∣vented him; but, if he lives,
he intends to see you this next ensuing Summer. I have been un∣der dreadful
Apprehensions of his drawing near the Time of his Dissolution, and great
Reason I <PB N="29" REF="47"/> had, you'll say, when I tell you, that for
six Weeks he had not Spirits to squeeze <HI>his dear</HI> MOLLY by the

improve his little Flock; yet (such is the Perverseness of the People,

<SALUTE>Dear Madam,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I OUGHT, and really intended, to have made Use of the
Permission you gave me, to trou∣ble you with a Letter before this Time; but
you do not need any Thing to lower your Spirits, and my Letters can hardly have
any other Effect upon harder Hearts than yours, When I lost my dear, and by
me, ever-lament∣ed Son,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Lord BEAUCHAMP.</NOTE>
every Faculty to please (if ever I were possessed of any such) died
with him. I have no longer any chearful Thoughts to communi∣cate to my Friends;
but as the Joy and Pride of my Heart withers in his Grave, my Mind 
<PB N="31" REF="49"/> is continually haunting those Mansions of the Dead,
and is but too inattentive to what passes in a World, where I have still
Duties and At∣tachments, which I ought to be, and, I hope, I may truly say, I
am thankful for. I am sure my Affection for my Lord HERTFORD, and Solicitude
for his Welfare, are sincere; since, if I know my own Heart, I would not
deliberate a Mo∣ment to lay down my Life for his Service. Lady BETTY and Sir
HUGH SMITHSON, and their Chil∣dren, are justly dear to me; and I still feel
the Bonds of tender Friendship: but I enjoy all these Blessings with
Trembling and Anxiety; for, after my dear BEAUCHAMP, what human Things can
appear permanent? Youth, Beauty, Vir∣tue, Health, were not sufficient to
save him from the Hand of Death! And who then can think themselves
secure? These are the melan∣choly Considerations, which generally
entertain my waking Hours. Tho' sometimes I am able to view the bright Side
of my Fate, and ask myself, for whom I grieve? Only for my∣self? How
narrow an Affection does this im∣ply! Could he have lived long as my fondest
Wish desired, what could I have asked, at the End of that Term, more,
than the Assurance <PB N="32" REF="50"/> that he should be placed where I
humbly hope, and confidently trust, he is, beyond the Reach of Sorrow, Sin,
or Sickness? But I must leave a Subject, which, tho' I am never tired of, I
ought, in regard to my Friends, to be silent upon, and ask you, where you
would have the Collection of Letters sent, which you were so good to
subscribe for at my Desire? I have a Letter from Mr. COLLINS this Day, in
which he desires to receive your Commands. My Lord, and Mr. COWLAD, charge me

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I MUST certainly stand in a very bad Light, if, after so many
Favours and Obligations conferred on me, I should be so idle, as not to
attempt to shew my Gratitude. But how can this be done? Where is the Pen that
can describe the Pleasures I have been entertained with? (mine cannot do
it—nay, even a THOM∣SON's would fail here) or where shall those
Thanks, or that Praise begin, that ne'er can end?—But hold—He
wants no Thanks, he desires no Praise, he follows not Fame, but Fame takes
Pride in following him. I shall only say, all that's agreeable is to be
found at that elegant Place, <HI>the Leasowes,</HI> where you reign, as
Monarch of all, and have only to say to this Man, "Go," and he goeth, to
ano∣ther, "Come," and he cometh, to your Ser∣vants, "Do this," and they do it,
and that <PB N="34" REF="52"/> with a Smile, which shews that Love, as well as
Duty, binds 'em to Obedience.</P>
<P>Mrs. A— opens not her Mouth, but in Praise of you and yours.
She designs to me∣tamorphose into a Pigeon, and you may ex∣pect to find her
cooing in VIRGIL's Grove. Miss K— thanks you for her Picture, and

<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>A—n,</HI> 
<DATE><HI>Nov.</HI> 1, 1746.</DATE></DATELINE> 
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I CAN no longer forbear telling you, that you have in your last,
obliged me more than by any one Action of your whole Life, and for which I
could almost call you Friend; (which, I assure you, is the highest
Appellation I can bestow) for I must tell you, that no one yet ever
commenced a Friend of mine, till they had corrected me of some Fault,
Failing, or Error; and tho' I've long since been taught, that I ought not to
make a Friend of any but my own Sex, together with other Particulars parallel
to that, yet I cannot but think it a friendly Act, and as such esteem it.
For my∣self, <PB N="36" REF="54"/> let me say, that I am not so
obstinate as to persist in an Error for the Sake of supporting a wrong
Judgment; and had I discovered Rea∣son to dispute Superiority with you in
any Respect, I should have thought you little wor∣thy of my
Correspondence; instead of which, I allow you to excel, much beyond
myself, in all Pre-eminence.</P>
<P>Before I proceed any farther, let me clear Mrs. A— from the
<HI>Aspersion</HI> her Judgment seems to lie under in this Affair,
otherwise I shall appear to be afraid of the Censure it de∣serves. Know
then, 'twas I chose her Shape; and, peradventure, the better to serve my
own Purposes; for how know you, but I intended to make a Letter-Carrier of
her, (as they do in <HI>Babylon, Aleppo,</HI> and the <HI>East-Indies)</HI>
and by that Means to accommodate myself with a swifter Messenger than
the Post? And as I knew her Inclination, when a reasonable Crea∣ture, I
concluded, after Transmigration, In∣stinct would then as naturally incline
her to frequent VIRGIL<HI>'s Grove.</HI> How unnatural so∣ever this Shape may
appear to the Grove, I must tell you, I could produce some Authori∣ties 
<PB N="37" REF="55"/> on my Side, exclusive of those you have mentioned; but
I am not about to do this, for, as you seem to disallow it, I readily give
it up, and answer, 
<Q REND="inline">"True, O King!"</Q>—Nay, I think to be in the
Wrong, and to be re∣proved in such an ingenious, humane, and po∣lite Manner
by you, more than equals being in the Right. I believe too, 'twill be for your
Interest, that she remain in her own Shape, for some Time, as her Fingers
are employed in knotting Fringe for you, so you find you have no Occasion
to buy; 'twill be ready be∣fore the Season for wearing it comes.</P>
<P>Marvel not that I don't admit your next Assertion, maugre all
the Forces you can raise, nay, tho' the whole nine Muses com∣bined
against me, I'll be absolute for once. I am as tenacious of my Prerogatives
as any of my Sex, nor do I think I have been guilty of an Infringement in what
I have said. I am neither so insensible of Favours as not to
dis∣cover 'em, nor am I so proud, or so prudish, as not to acknowledge
'em. Surely, you have dealt with none but the last-mentioned Sort of the Sex,
that you are so alarmed at what I <PB N="38" REF="56"/> have said. But no
more of this—I now enter a Caveat to the Subject.</P>
<P>Mr. A— is much pleased with your kind Remembrance of him. He
made an excellent <HI>Hare-Chase</HI> Preachment on the
<HI>Thanksgiving-Day</HI>; for he told us all the Doublings and Turnings
<HI>the Pretender</HI> and his Party made from their first Effort to their
Defeat. He has got his Brother with him, a Man, whose Aspect, at one View,
discovers to you the Im∣becility of his Mind. I do not yet know in what
Capacity he is to act, but am a little afraid 'twill prove that of a Servant,
which will be similar to P—Y's Generosity.</P>
<P>There was a droll Scene the other Day, at <HI>W—d,</HI>
between bright B—Y, and old Mrs. D—T's Servant, who was sent to
ask him to Dinner. The Message delivered, B—Y nodded his Head, and
replied, 
<Q REND="inline">"I conno' come."</Q> The Servant, not content with
this, followed, pulled him by the Sleeve, and intreated him; upon which he
responsed, 
<Q REND="inline">"<HI>I conno' come, nor I won∣no' come.</HI>"</Q> At
this, the Man retreated, much chagrin'd, thinking, no doubt, his Mistress 
<PB N="39" REF="57"/> slighted, that his own Pocket had lost a
<HI>Chance,</HI> and nothing had been befriended—but the Sir-Loin. It was
great Glee to the Spectators, and, being <HI>Sunday,</HI> there was a numerous
Audience.</P>
<P>You have certainly added Beauty as well as Gentility to the Place,
by destroying those Hedges; for I think there can scarce be a Hedge near
you, that does not hide a thou∣sand Beauties; and as to the Horse-Pond, it
disturbed me greatly when I was there. Has Monsieur <HI>Snuff-Box</HI>
sent your Busts, and will your Elegies ever be printed? Lord DUDLEY does us
an honour, when he mentions us, and, if drinking his Health is an Equivalent, I
assure you we are not behind-hand with his Lord∣ship. I had a Letter from
Mr. D—N this Week; he seems as much alarmed as you at my moderate
Acknowledgment. Miss F—Y is very glad to hear that you design her a
Pic∣ture. The enclosed is from Mr. D—IE. Sure∣ly, <HI>Gossip</HI>
JOAN never prated faster.</P>
<P>I have only to add, that I wish you an un∣tarnished Bliss in
the Company of your po∣lished Friend, and that you may enjoy each 
<PB N="40" REF="58"/> other's Friendship even to the Age of old NESTOR,

<SALUTE>Dear Mr. JAGO,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I THINK I have out-corresponded all my Correspondents; whether
you are the last that is to be subdued, I cannot say; but the Rest are
so fatigued, that they are not able to achieve a Line. Apprized of this, and
being by Nature disposed to have Mercy on the Van∣quished, 
<Q>Parcere subjectis, &amp; debellare superbos,</Q> 
<PB N="42" REF="60"/> I seldom write a Syllable more than is requisite to
further some Scheme, or ascertain some In∣terview; the latter being the
Purpose of this mine Epistle. I am in great Hopes I shall be at Liberty
to see you, ere many Weeks be past, and would beg of you to let me know by
a Line, when I am most likely, or when very unlikely, to meet with you at
Home. The Reason why I can fix no week, at present, is, that I am in daily
Expectations of Mr. LYTTELTON, and the HAGLEY Family. I dined there, some
Time since, with Mr. PITT, Mr. BOUHOURS, Mr. CAMPION, and all the World. Mr.
THOM∣SON, that right friendly Bard, was expected, and I fancy may be there now.
Mr. LYT∣TELTON offered me the Visit, and I own I am pleased with the
Prospect of shewing him some∣thing at the <HI>Leasowes</HI> beyond his
Expectations. I have made a great Improvement in VIRGIL's Grove, since you
were here, and have finished a new Path from it to the House, after the
Manner you approved. They are going to build a Rotund to terminate the Visto
at <HI>Hagley</HI>; I think there is a little Hill joining the Park, that would
suit one better, tho' it will be very pretty where it is.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="61"/>If I come to your House, I won't go to Mr.
M—R's. He has been, twice, as near me as the <HI>Grange,</HI> with
CHARLES LYTTELTON, but never deemed my Situation worth seeing. I doubt you
are a little too modest in praising it, wherever you go. Why don't you
applaud it with both Hands?— 
<Q> 
<L>Parcentes ego Dexteras odi—</L> 
<L>Sparge Rosas—</L></Q> I am so very much enamoured,
that is, so very partial to my native Place, that it seems a Mi∣racle to
me, how it comes not to be famous. But to be serious—How my Lord DUDLEY
is tumbled about the World! He was overturned in going to Town, and now again
in coming back. Is not this falling up Stairs and down
Stairs?—Nevertheless, he is safe and sound, and able to sit up
with you and me till twelve or one at Night, as I know by last
<HI>Monday's</HI> Ex∣perience.</P>
<P>I have somewhere about a thousand Things to say to
you—not now tho'—Mrs. KNIGHT's <PB N="44" REF="62"/> Visit I
reserve till I see you. A Coach with a Coronet is a pretty Kind of
Phaenomenon at my Door;—few Things prettier—ex∣cept the Face of
such a Friend as you; for I do not want the Grace to prefer a spirituous
and generous Friendship to all the Gewgaws that Ambition can contrive.</P>
<P>I have wrote out my Elegies, and heartily wish you had them to
look over, before I come, but I know not how to send them. I shall bring
and leave much Poetry with you—

<P>AS it has hitherto seemed good to you to expatiate pretty largely
on so diminu∣tive a Subject as a Thimble, I flatter myself that you may
read with Patience an Account of the Life and Conversation of your most
trifling humble Servant. Otherwise, I should not have told you, that I am
extremely un∣happy in my present Situation; that, when you left the Country,
I had recourse to another Kind of natural Beauties, namely, that which is to
be found in 
<Q REND="inline">"Groves, Meads, and murmuring Streams,"</Q> and so
long as Summer was pleased to continue his Favours, I looked upon your 
<PB N="46" REF="64"/> Departure as what only changed my Pleasure to
Amusement. Now, indeed, Summer has forsaken me likewise; the Trees and
Groves are stripped of their Covering, and I am left without any Fence
against Spleen, Vapours, Megrim, Discontent, and a numerous Train of such
Sort of Beings, which plague me to Death, whenever I offer to recollect your
Ab∣sence; and how often that happens, I leave any one to guess but
yourself, because any one else is better acquainted with the numerous
Ways and Means you have of rendering your Company agreeable. I appeal also to
the same Persons to guess how provoking you are, when you mention the
Possibility there was that I might have seen you at the
<HI>Leasowes</HI> some Time ago. What need you tell one of it, since it
could not be effected? Why will you put me upon cursing Fortune upon more
Accounts than I have already Occasion to do? Pray let me endeavour to conform
myself to my real Circumstances, rather than give me a Glimpse of the
Pleasure which you was about to do me, and yet had not the Goodness to go
through with. I want no Inducements to come to <HI>Wor∣cester,</HI> since I
discovered that you lived there, <PB N="47" REF="65"/> and that being all that
was necessary, tho' you have mentioned others that are attractive.</P>
<P>I beg you would make my Compliments agreeable to Mrs. WINSMORE,
which you are best capable of doing, for two Reasons; first, because
you know the Sincerity of my Esteem, and, secondly, because I have no
Idea how any Thing you say can be disagreeable. The Con∣sideration that
she remembers me, and that she spoke of me in the same Breath with Mrs.
KNIGHT (as my Vanity interprets your Letter) makes me so vain, that I, with

<P>I WAS much concerned to hear by Mr. WILLIAMS's Account, last
<HI>Thursday,</HI> that your Ladyship has been greatly indisposed. The
Particulars of your Disorder he does not mention, but tells me, he was
desired to give it as a Reason that I did not hear from you before. It is
as natural for me to make En∣quiry concerning the Recovery of your Health, as
it is for me to wish it, which I very ear∣nestly do; I have, therefore,
sent an honest Neighbour of mine upon this Errand, who will be glad of an
Opportunity of seeing <HI>Bar∣rels.</HI> Poor TOM, my trusty Servant, has,
ever since I came from <HI>Barrels,</HI> been in a very dange∣rous way; and
whether he ever may regain the small Share of Health he has been used to,
is a great Question, else I had sent something <PB N="51" REF="69"/>
sooner. But I must request your Ladyship not to write, if you find it
the least trouble∣some. A verbal Message will be very sufficient,
till such Time as you can write me a full Account of your Recovery.</P>
<P>I have no Particulars that can tempt me to enlarge this Letter, and,
indeed, I hardly wish for any, lest I should accidentally let fall any
Thing, that might tempt you, at this Time, to write an Answer; which, tho'
so highly agreeable to me at a more favourable Season, can afford me little
Satisfaction, when I con∣jecture that you write in Pain.</P>
<P>I hope Mr. HALL is recovered by this Time. As my rural Scenery could
not attract him hither in Summer, I have little Hopes that my Conversation
can have that Effect in Win∣ter. Few Persons care to ride twelve dirty Miles
in Winter, be their Charity ever so great,

<P>AFTER having owned, that the Fear your Ladyship has been under, is
in reality to be imputed to me, I am at a Loss for Words to express my
Concern, or to alleviate my Fault. I will not, however, disallow that the
Book came to Hand much sooner than I could reasonably expect it, and that
the Let∣ter enclosed in it, gave me that uncommon Pleasure, which your
Ladyship's never fail to do. I have nothing to say in my Behalf, but that I
have never had Health or Spirits since I received it, that might encourage me
to think I could return an Answer as I ought; and even to-night my Spirits
are so bad, and my Head so confused, that I have no Reason to hope
<HI>these few Lines</HI> can do any Thing more, than free you from your

<P>I do not know how far your Ladyship's Name may be

I had been Par∣son H—K, your Ladyship should not have known from
me, that there was any Woman in the World, who could express herself
con∣cerning you with the Indecency you mention. I am astonished at her
Behaviour, and not a little at her Forgetfulness. There seems to me to be
no surer Conveyance in the World than that of the Farmer, by whom I sent my
Letter to the Post-Office at <HI>Henley,</HI> and by whom, I suppose, you
conveyed your Parcel. However, in Obedience to your Ladyship's Commands, I
have sent this Letter to Master H—K, and shall have an additional
Pressure on my Spirits, till I hear you have been pleased to forgive my
Neglect. I know extremely well, that Want of Time and Leisure, and some
other Excuses, which are often made for not writing, can be of Weight from
<HI>no one</HI> but a Cobler, who has ten or a dozen Children dependent on a
<HI>Tatch∣ing-End</HI>; <PB N="55" REF="73"/> but I know as well, that your
Lady∣ship's is no ordinary Correspondence, and that a Person ought to
have a clear Head, and an unembarrassed Chearfulness of Temper, when he
sits down to answer any Letter of yours. For my Part, I hardly look upon
this as any Letter <HI>at all,</HI> and will infallibly write again, as soon
as I can recover my natural State of Mind. I have <HI>as</HI> little Reason
to consider the enclosed <HI>as Poetry</HI>; but as they were
<HI>short</HI> Compositions, I had been writing them out yesterday, with
a Design to send them to the Post-Office to-night.</P>
<P>I am afraid I have tired your Ladyship with Madrigal and Sonnet. I
hope, when the Weather gets finer (with which my Spirits uniformly
sympathize) to vary my Stile a lit∣tle for your Ladyship's Amusement; in
the mean Time, I have sent you a Poem, written by a Gentleman of my
Acquaintance, and shewn up, for a College-Exercise, in Print. Your
Ladyship will soon discover a juvenile Want of Judgment in several
Places; but I trust that the Elegance of his Fancy you will admire. He
sometimes comes and and stays <PB N="56" REF="74"/> a Month with me at the
<HI>Leasowes,</HI> in the Sum∣mer; the next Time he does so, I will be
obliged to your Ladyship for Leave to intro∣duce him at <HI>Barrels.</HI> I
am mistaken, if he will not be pleased almost to a Degree of
En∣thusiasm.</P>
<P>As to your Ladyship's Lameness, tho' it comes last in this
irregular Letter, I beg Leave to assure you, that it gave me a sincere
Con∣cern to hear that it was bad, and a very sen∣sible Pleasure to hear
it was abated. I as hear∣tily wish your Ladyship's Health and Happi∣ness
as you do yourself; and as I solemnly as∣sure you, that such is
always the Disposition of my Mind, I <HI>will</HI> hope to be forgiven, if
I should, through Ignorance, fall short in my Means of expressing it.
This last Neglect is what I shall scarce again be guilty of, and can only
be excused by your Ladyship's Candour.</P>

<P>I HAVE sent your Ladyship a Book of Gar∣dening, which I
borrowed, about five Years ago, of a Neighbour. If it will be of any Service to
you, in modelling the crooked Walks in your Shrubbery, I shall be glad; and
you may return it at your Leisure, as <HI>I</HI> do. It is written by a poor
illiterate Fellow, notwith∣standing its Dedication to His Majesty, <HI>who

something of his Ignorance, perhaps, in every Page; more especially Page
204, first Part, where he talks of MINERVA <PB N="58" REF="76"/> <HI>and</HI>

seemingly, when the present <HI>natural</HI> Taste began to dawn, and

that it is more in the Mind than Externals is to me a Demonstra∣tion. I'm

it may be allowable for a Recluse to admire, under certain Limitations. If
not, I can only say, that I must remain a very im∣perfect Hermit, till I am

<OPENER><DATELINE>The <HI>Leasowes.</HI></DATELINE> 
<SALUTE>Dear Madam,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THO' I think it is a Sort of Maxim, that a Person in
<HI>London</HI> seldom <HI>complains</HI> he is forgotten by his Friends in
the Country, yet I cannot, by any Means, prevail upon my Con∣science to
acquit me of a Sort of disrespectful Silence, since your Ladyship went
to Town. It was not either the Politics or the Amuse∣ments of our great
Metropolis, that could make the Letters of your Friends appear impertinent, or
even indifferent to you; and tho' the sublime Entertainment you must
receive from the Con∣versation of so great a Man as Lord BOLING∣BROKE,
might bid the fairest to do so, yet was I not without Conviction, that your
Ladyship would feel some sort of Complacency upon the Sight of a Scrip of
Paper, which should ac∣quaint you that I was alive.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="81"/>Alive, indeed, I am; at least, if it may be
called so, to exist among a Set of People, whose Employments,
Passions, and Sentiments, are entirely foreign to my own; and where I
see, and hear, and do nothing, but what I think may as well be left unseen,
unheard, and un∣done. What can your Ladyship expect from a Correspondent
so situated, beside pure Re∣spect and Friendship, and many artless
Assu∣rances of their Reality and Continuance?</P>
<P>Mr. O— stayed pretty near a Week with me. He has, I think,
strict Honour, Good-nature, and good Sense. What he wants, in my Eye, is a
little genuine <HI>Taste</HI>; for tho' good Sense may, by Degrees, enable
a Person to discover the Beauties of Nature or Art, yet it can never
furnish him with any extraordinary Relish or Enjoyment of them, which is
the Effect of innate Taste alone, and which differs as widely from the
former, as the Palate differs from the Brain. Your Ladyship has, I dare
say, frequently made the same observation.</P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="82"/>You will hear Sir THOMAS LYTTELTON,
notwithstanding he complained always of his <HI>Head,</HI> died of a
<HI>Polypus</HI> in the <HI>great Artery</HI>; which, I do not find, was ever,
in the least, suspected by his Physicians; but which, if it had been
ever so apparent, they could not pos∣sibly have cured. You will imagine
that his Death must have thrown a Sort of Gloom round the Villages in his
Neighbourhood. A nume∣rous and fashionable Family animates a Coun∣try-Place
to an inconceivable Degree. The Family at <HI>Hagley</HI> will be immediately
dispersed. Miss LYTTELTON goes to Lady LITCHFIELD's, to the
<HI>Colonel</HI>'s, to <HI>London,</HI> and does not think to settle. Miss
WEST goes first to <HI>Stow,</HI> and then intends to reside with her
Brother the <HI>Commodore.</HI> Sir GEORGE and his Lady set out for
<HI>London</HI> to-morrow, and as they propose to build, next Spring, upon
the <HI>old Foundation,</HI> it may be many Years ere they come to reside
amongst us, even for a small Part of the Sum∣mer.</P>
<P>Lord DUDLEY and I dined together at <HI>Hag∣ley</HI> last
<HI>Wednesday,</HI> where we found Lord AN∣SON's <PB N="65" REF="83"/>
Brother, and some other Company. Mr. MILLER unluckily asked me at Table,
how I liked the new Situation of their Column; which threw me under a
Necessity of offending either against the Rules of Politeness, or (what
it more sacred with me) the Laws of Sincerity. The Truth is, I do not like it
upon many Ac∣counts; and I am persuaded, before many Years are past, they
will be of the same Mind. But least of all, do I approve their Intentions
of building three new Fronts, and altering every Room by a gothic Model, and
that with an Eye to Frugality, at the same Time that they have not an Inch of
Gothicism about the House, to warp their Imagination that Way. But this
Subject never fails to lead me too far; nor can I explain myself to the full,
unless I could shew your Ladyship their Plan. The fine Si∣tuation they
have, within an hundred Yards, they neglect;—in short, as it appears to
me, they are going to sacrifice an Opportunity of rendering their Place
compleat, for the Sake of an imperfect, but expensive Specimen of gothic
Architecture; which, not having its Founda∣tion either in Truth or Proportion,
will fall into <PB N="66" REF="84"/> Disgrace again in the Course of a few
Years—Can one then forbear crying out, 
<Q REND="inline">"The Graces droop"—</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">"Am I in <HI>Greece</HI> or in
<HI>Gothland?</HI>"</Q> But as their Resolution seems fixed, I mention this
in Confidence, and must, for the future, lay my Finger on my Mouth.</P>
<P>Mr. S— has so mangled and disfigured my <HI>Grove,</HI> that
I dare not send it to your Lady∣ship, till he has altered the Plate, so
as to render it less intolerable. FLUELLIN, as I remember, in
SHAKESPEARE,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Historical Play of King HENRY V.</NOTE>

modest Man, has seemed to content himself with some such Degree of
Resemblance: but I wish him well, and will cause him, one Day, to do the
Place Justice, for his own Sake as well as mine—for his own, as his

<DATE><HI>May</HI> 15, 1748.</DATE></DATELINE> 
<SALUTE>Dear Madam,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HOW long soever your Letters are in co∣ming, they never fail to
assure their Welcome, by being more agreeable and en∣tertaining, as well as
breathing more of Friend∣ship, than any Body's <HI>else</HI> have the Art
of doing. I have been here about a Month, and find some little Improvements,
which were ordered when we went to <HI>London,</HI> compleated; 
<PB N="68" REF="86"/> and I think they are not quite unworthy of the Name. A
Piece of waste Ground, on the lower Side of the Abbey-Walk, has been turned
into a Corn-Field, and a Turf-Walk, about eight Feet wide, round it; close to
a flourishing Haw∣thorn Hedge; on one Side, there is a thatched Seat open on
three Sides, which pretends to no Name of greater Dignity, than justly
be∣longs to what it represents, namely a Shep∣herd's Hut; before it there is
an irregular Piece of Turf, which was spared for the Sake of some old Oaks
and Beeches, which are scattered upon it; and as you are sitting down
there, you have, under these Boughs, a direct View of <HI>Windsor</HI>
Castle. There are Sweet-Williams, Narcissus's, Rose-Campions, and
such Flowers as the Hares will not eat, in little Borders, round the Foot of
every Tree; and I almost flatter myself, that you would not be
displeased with the rural Appearance of the whole. The Rains have given us
the strongest Verdure I ever saw: our Lawns and Meadows are enamelled
with a Profusion of Dasies and Cowslips, and we have the greatest
Appearance of Fruit that has been seen these many Years. I conclude you
will read Mr. <PB N="69" REF="87"/> THOMSON's <HI>Castle of Indolence</HI>:
'tis after the Manner of SPENCER, but I think he does not always keep so
close to his Stile, as the <HI>Author of the School-Mistress,</HI>
whose Name I never knew, till you were so good as to inform me of it. I
think it a charming Poem; and was very much pleased with his Ballad of
<HI>Queen</HI> ELIZABETH's seeing the Milk-Maid. She ap∣appears, at least
in my humble Imagination, in a more natural Light, than when we hear of her
bullying foreign Powers, and cutting off the Head of an unhappy Queen, who fled
to her for Protection. But to return to <HI>the Castle of Indolence</HI>; I
believe it will afford you much Entertainment; there are many pretty Paintings
in it, but I think the <HI>Wizard's Song</HI> deserves a Preference.— 
<Q REND="inline">"He needs no Muse who dictates from his
Heart."</Q> Have you met with two little Volumes, which contain four
Contemplations, written by a Mr. JAMES HERVEY, a young <HI>Cornish</HI> or
<HI>Devonshire</HI> Cler∣gyman? The Subjects are upon walking among the
Tombs, upon a Flower Garden, upon Night, and upon the starry Heavens. There
is something poetical and truly pious. Now I have got into the Impertinence
of recommen∣ding <PB N="70" REF="88"/> Books to one who is a much better Judge
than myself, I must name an <HI>Essay on Delicacy,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"> 
<P>The <HI>Essay on Delicacy,</HI> here mentioned, was the
Pro∣duction of Dr. NATHANIEL LANCASTER, many Years Rector of <HI>Stanford
Rivers,</HI> near <HI>Ongar,</HI> in <HI>Essex,</HI> Uncle to the Editor of
these Letters. He was a Man of strong natural Parts, great Erudition,
refined Taste, and master of a nervous, and at the same Time, elegant
Stile, as is very obvious to every one who has had the Happiness to read the
Essay here spoken of. His Writings were fewer in Number than their
Author's Genius seemed to promise to his Friends, and his Publications
less known than their intrinsic Excellence deserved. Had he been as
solicitous, as he was capable, to instruct and please the World, few
Prose-Writers would have surpassed him; but in his later Years, he
lived a Recluse, and whatever he composed in the Hours of retired
Leisure, he (unhappily for the Public) ordered to be burned, which was
religiously (I had almost said irreligiously) performed.</P> 
<P>He was a Native of <HI>Cheshire,</HI> and, in his earlier
Years, under the Patronage and Friendship of the late Earl of CHOLMONDELEY,
mixed in all the more exalted Scenes of polished Life, where his lively
Spirit, and brilliant Conversation, rendered him universally
distinguished and esteemed; and even, till within a few Months of his
De∣cease, (near seventy-five Years of Age) these Faculties could scarce
be said to be impaired.</P> 
<P>The <HI>Essay on Delicacy,</HI> (of which we are now
speaking) the only material Work of his, which the Editor knows to have
survived him, was first printed in the Year 1748, and has been very
judiciously and meritoriously preserved by the late Mr. DODSLEY, in his
Fugitive Pieces, published in two Volumes.</P></NOTE> a Subject which, if I
were not acquainted with <PB N="71" REF="89"/> you, and one or two more, I
should imagine had no longer an Existence upon our Globe.</P>
<P>I sincerely sympathize in the Pleasure which you must feel,
Dear Madam, from the extreme good Character which every Body gives of your Son,
and which his Behaviour to you proves he deserves. May this, with every other
Bles∣sing, be long continued to you, and may you always look upon me as a

<SALUTE>Dear Mr. GRAVES,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I FIND a very strong Impulse, prompting me to write to you this
Evening. I don't know whether I ever let you into the Secret, that I re∣ceive
an inward Satisfaction at the Time that I am sending you a Letter, and that
this Action partakes of the Nature of all virtuous ones, in being its own
Reward. However we are taught to hope for <HI>other</HI> and more
<HI>ample</HI> Rewards at∣tending Virtue, as I am inclined to expect a more
considerable Pleasure, when I receive your Answer. My Soul now leans
entirely on the Friendship of a few private Acquaintance, and if they drop
me, I shall be a wretched Misan∣thrope. Is it a great Fatigue to you to
sit down some vacant Half-Hour, and scribble me a few Lines, relating to
the State of your Mind, <PB N="73" REF="91"/> and your Affairs?—DICK JAGO,
who called accidentally at a Public-house, at <HI>Mickleton,</HI> told me,
they heard —; mentioning, at the same Time, his thorough Conviction,
that, <HI>whatever</HI> might prove the Event of this Affair, as <HI>you</HI>
were a Principal, it would be as it <HI>ought.</HI> Mr. SMITH, (the Designer)
who knew you too, was here at the same Time, and many civil Things, very
agreeable to me, were said in your Behalf; 
<Q REND="inline">"<HI>Immo, Omnes omnia bona dix∣ere.</HI>"</Q> As to
—</P>
<P>I thank you for your little Strictures on the
<HI>School-Mistress.</HI> I have sacrificed my Partiality to your
unbiassed Judgment; <HI>Multa gemens,</HI> have I sacrificed it. The
Truth is, I am not quite convinced (tho' I have acted as if I were) that one
should give up any Part, that appears droll in itself, and makes the Poem,
on the whole, more agreeable, for the Sake of rendering it a more perfect
Imitation of SPENCER. But when you have more Leisure, and I collect my 
<PB N="74" REF="92"/> Pieces, I don't despair of furnishing a more compleat
Edition yet.</P>
<P>Mr. SMITH (whom I mentioned just now) has taken two Views of
<HI>Hagley-Park,</HI> which, with two from other Places, compleat a Set; the
Subscription-Price, half a Guinea; but he takes other little Views of the
closer Scenes, and of particular Beauties, which will form a Draw∣ing-Book,
and which I shall like beyond those I have subscribed for. Would you
not be sur∣prized to see a Draught of my VIRGIL's <HI>Grove</HI> inserted
among the latter?—He took one, and promised to have it engraved, and
inserted somewhere; but I had rather he should stay a Week, and take
about four Views, and that you were here, and would give him some
In∣structions, and it should make a little Drawing-Book to sell for a
Shilling. But, 
<Q REND="inline">"Ah, me!—I fondly dream"</Q>—The Days of
Fancy and dear Enthusiasm will never more return! Such as those that flew
over our Heads when you were <HI>here,</HI> and at <HI>Harborough,</HI> on your

<P>WHEN I received your Ladyship's Letter on <HI>Friday,</HI> I was
just upon the Point of setting out for <HI>Broom</HI>; I therefore declined
answering it, till I had spoke with Miss DOL∣MAN. It is now with the
greatest Thankful∣ness for your obliging Invitation, and the most
pleasing Idea of the Visit we propose, that I am to inform your
Ladyship, we intend wai∣ting on you upon <HI>Tuesday</HI> or
<HI>Wednesday</HI> sev'n-night. If you should have <HI>much</HI> Company
at that Time, or the Visit should be otherwise unseasonable, your
Ladyship will be so good as to let us know; if not, I will not fail to
shew Miss DOLMAN the Way to the most agreeable Entertainment, and the
most enga∣ging Conversation, I have met with any where. Your Ladyship
will not imagine that I under∣stand <PB N="77" REF="95"/>
<HI>Entertainment</HI> in the vulgar Sense; (tho' what I say is true enough
in <HI>that)</HI> my chief Pleasures, I flatter myself, are Pleasures of
the <HI>Mind</HI>; and I can say, with great Truth, that my Mind was never
more <HI>disposed</HI> to be pleased any where <HI>else,</HI> or found
equal Opportunities to gratify that Disposition.</P>
<P>Miss DOLMAN, tho' she has not seen much of the World, has done
great Things, or, in other Words, has made good Use of the Op∣portunities
she <HI>has</HI> had, if she can deserve any Part of that favourable
Mention you make of her. All I know is, that she has <HI>Taste</HI> enough
to put the Pleasure I have promised her at <HI>Barrels</HI> out of all
Dispute.</P>
<P>I now proceed to other Things. I have sent your Ladyship the
<HI>first Number</HI> of <HI>Sickness,</HI> a Poem, which is all I have. I
<HI>send</HI> it as indeed I <HI>offered</HI> it, because it bears some
Relation to Lady HERTFORD, on Account of the Panegy∣rick of Lord BEAUCHAMP,
which I believe is just.</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="96"/>I have of late read the Life of Colonel
GAR∣DINER, being induced to do so by a Vision, which is described there,
and which I hear Mr. LYTTELTON countenances. I will give your Ladyship my
Opinion of the Story, when I come to <HI>Barrels.</HI></P>
<P>Pray don't buy the Books <HI>I</HI> talked of; you will hardly read
them twice; and I can lend you HERVEY's <HI>Meditations,</HI> the <HI>Life of
Colo∣nel</HI> GARDINER, and, in a short Time, <HI>Memoirs of Mrs.</HI>
PILKINGTON, either of my own, or my Brother's. I beseech your Ladyship,
that I may have leave to save you six Shillings, and three Shillings, and
three Shillings; that is, according to the old Maxim, <HI>(viz.</HI> a
<HI>Penny sav'd, &amp;c.)</HI> put into the Power of my Grati∣tude, to be of
about twelve Shillings signifi∣cancy. By so doing, I shall not only talk,
but proceed to one <HI>ouvert Act</HI> in the Cause of Oeconomy.—I
wish it be not the only one.</P>
<P>In regard to Mr. OUTING, I will only say, that I please myself
with the full Assurance of meeting him at <HI>Barrels.</HI> It is out of my
Power this Day to send you an <HI>amusing</HI> Letter, <PB N="79" REF="97"/>
whether it be so at other Times or not. There is not a single Cloud or
Dimness in the Sky, but has its exact Image or Counterpart in my Imagination;

<HEAD>LETTER XXIII. Countess of HERTFORD to Lady LUXBOROUGH.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Percy Lodge,</HI> 
<DATE><HI>Nov.</HI> 20, 1748.</DATE></DATELINE> 
<SALUTE>Dear Madam,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Remember Mrs. HIGGONS used to say, Lady CLARENDON had such a
Power over her Understanding, that she might persuade her she was a
Fish. You have pretty near the same Ascendant over mine, yet cannot quite
convince me, that eight Months is not an immoderate while to keep Silence, and
make a Chasm in a Correspondence with a Friend, who incessantly
wishes to hear of your Health and Happiness. I am not more easily
seduced into an assent to your Apology; for though I admire the beautiful
Language in which the Fiction of your Dullness is painted, I cannot mistake
it for a Truth. I am so bad at Inven∣tion, that I will not search for an
ingenious Fable, to excuse myself for troubling you with an Answer so
soon, though my Readiness to obey <PB N="82" REF="100"/> your Commands, in
subscribing for the Prints you mention (if you will let me know where I
must send for a Receipt) might furnish me with one: but honestly own,
that as my Lord has been in <HI>London</HI> since <HI>Thursday,</HI> I did
not know how to employ the leisure Hours his Absence afforded me, more to
my Satisfaction.</P>
<P>We returned hither from <HI>Bath</HI> only <HI>Friday</HI> the
Eleventh: we were there two Months, the last Fortnight of which we were
detained, after all our Things were gone, by my poor Lord's having a Fit of the
Gout; and I be∣lieve we came away rather too soon after it, for his Limbs had
not recovered their Strength, so that he was terribly fatigued; however, he
has now recovered it, and is certainly upon the whole infinitely the better,
for having drank the <HI>Bath</HI> Waters. If I could envy you, dear Ma∣dam, I
should be tempted to do it, for being in Reach of <HI>Hagley,</HI> for having
Mr. WEST for a Neighbour, and Mr. SHENSTONE for a Friend. He has obliged me
so much, in letting me see his charming Ode upon Autumn, and the Ho∣nour he
does Mr. THOMSON's Memory in that Poem, and in his Design to erect an Urn 
<PB N="83" REF="101"/> for him in VIRGIL's <HI>Grove,</HI> that I am sorry I
cannot agree with him, in his Dislike to <HI>Au∣tumn.</HI> On the contrary, I
draw one Motive of my Partiality to it, from a similar Cause to what he
partly ascribes his Aversion: he hates it as a Season which deprived him
of a Friend; I love it, because the latest Days my Heart could boast of
Happiness, in the best and most beloved of Sons, were in that Time of the
Year, till (as Dr. YOUNG says) 
<Q> 
<L>—At <HI>Death</HI>'s Toll, whose restless, iron
Tongue</L> 
<L>Calls daily for his Millions at a Meal,</L> 
<L>Starting I woke, and found myself undone.</L></Q></P>
<P>And then, 
<Q> 
<L>The Clouds, the Winds, the Rains, the falling Leaves,</L> 
<L>The naked Branches, the poor shivering Birds—</L></Q>
Every Thing around me seemed to sympathize in my Distress, and still
at every melancholy Anniversary of my ever-to-be-lamented Loss, put on the
same friendly Appearance of social Sorrow; and I may say with MYRA, in
her <PB N="84" REF="102"/> Poem, before Mr. THOMSON's first Edition of the
Seasons, 
<Q> 
<L>To thee, my gently-drooping Head I bend,</L> 
<L>Thy Sigh my Sister, and thy Tear my Friend.</L></Q></P>
<P>Forgive me, dear Madam, for thus continu∣ally returning to this
afflicting Subject: but two Lines of Mr. POPE's, with the Alteration only of
one Word, must plead my excuse, 
<Q> 
<L>Of all Affliction taught a <HI>Sufferer</HI> yet,</L> 
<L>'Tis sure the hardest Science to forget.</L></Q></P>
<P>I have done—and will now tell you, that our being obliged to
go to <HI>Bath,</HI> has hindered us from undertaking any Thing here, so that
I have nothing to talk of that is new, and I am afraid there was Nothing here
before, that would make a tolerable Figure, either in a Print or a Drawing; a
Flat can hardly look well upon Paper, though in reality, the Variety of Woods
and Lawns, Water, Grass, and Gravel, may produce a Contrast not
unpleasing to the Eye. I am sorry you find any Defects in Mr. HERVEY; for
both the Design and Manner of his Writing pleases me extremely.</P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="103"/>I want to know what you think of the
<HI>Peru∣vian Letters,</HI> and especially of the Fifth in the Suite. I have
been very well entertained lately with the two first Volumes of the
<HI>Foundling,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The History of TOM JONES, by
HENRY FIELDING, Esq.</NOTE> written by Mr. FIELDING, but not to be
pub∣lished till the 22d of <HI>January</HI>; if the same Spi∣rit runs
through the whole Work, I think it it will be much preferable to JOSEPH
ANDREWS. My Lord is absent from <HI>London,</HI> but I hope will be here Time
enough to free this Letter, for I'm sure it is not worth the Postage.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN the first Place, I return you Thanks for your very polite
Letter, which, I do assure you, I was proud of receiving, and should have
troubled you with an Answer the same Day, could I write with as little
Difficulty as you.</P>
<P>I admire the Countess's Letter, and espe∣cially that Part about
her Son. She seems sensi∣ble of her great Loss still. She talks of
VIR∣GIL's <HI>Grove,</HI> as if she had seen it. I am sure, if she had,
she would have been highly de∣lighted with the Beauties of that Place. I want
Summer to come, that I may see the Urn, which you intend to erect to
THOMSON's Memory, and VIRGIL's <HI>Grove</HI> in Perfection.</P>
<P>With Carelessness and Inattention, I have read Mrs.
PILKINGTON's second Volume; she <PB N="87" REF="105"/> is still more
entertaining; I think she ex∣presses herself well; I fancy too her
Poetry to be good; and I dare say, she will think it hard not to be allowed
the Liberty of her Tongue and Pen.—But I ought to be ashamed of giving
my Opinion, with so much Free∣dom, to one who is so good a Judge of
Wri∣ting as you are.</P>
<P>My <HI>Litchfield</HI> Journey afforded me but slen∣der
Amusement; less even than I expected. Mrs. DOLMAN had two Visitants, Mrs.
WHIT∣BY and her Daughter, who came from the same Town where Lord ANSON lives.
They talked much in Praise of his Lordship, and seemed to be intimate
Acquaintance of his.</P>
<P>Miss FLETCHER's severe Letter has never been answered yet: I
hope, Sir, that will ex∣cuse for the Shortness of this, because I must
instantly set about writing one to her. Pray excuse this Nonsense,
with all its Faults, which are very numerous.</P>

<DATE><HI>March</HI> 26, 1749.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>SO, you are determined, Sir, to be silent, till I have wrote
again!—An effectual Me∣thod, indeed, to make me; for I should be very
imprudent, did I not procure myself your ini∣mitable Letters every
Opportunity I had, which are sure to please, amuse, and instruct at the
same Time. But I have really so great Con∣tempt for my own, that, when I
have finished a Letter, I can scarcely persuade myself to send it,
were I not inclined to believe, you are more my Friend, than to make any Use
of it to my Disadvantage.</P>
<P>Last Week I received an Epistle from Miss FANNY FLETCHER. All
she says in Relation to Lady LUXBOROUGH is as follows: 
<Q REND="inline">"Pray don't think what I said of Lord LUXBO∣ROUGH
proceeded either from Envy or Jea∣lousy. <PB N="89" REF="107"/> I assure
you, it did not. I am nei∣ther so stupid, nor so unreasonable, to
desire you to like me only, and hope I am far from speaking ill of any
Persons, because they have Accomplishments."</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">"Mrs. D—T, of <HI>Worfield,</HI> is dead. Her
Son is gone to <HI>Oxford,</HI> to qualify himself for a Living of
£.600 a Year, which his Aunt S—N has given him, together with an
Estate of £.100. The Living is held in Trust by one Mr.
W—RE."</Q></P>
<P>This is all she informs me of, that I think worth relating to you,
only that she has your Eclogues very safe, and has kept them, she says,
seven Months longer than you gave her Leave, yet hopes, and trusts, you
will forgive to <HI>seventy Times seven.</HI></P>
<P>If you only mentioned the Ruffles to me, as a Hint that you wanted a
Pair of that Sort, I am mighty glad I have taken it so. I have sent the
enclosed, to know whether the Flowers are filled up in the Manner you would
have 'em; if not, please to communicate to me, <PB N="90" REF="108"/> some
way or other, how you mean, and then I will persevere in my Work with
infinite Plea∣sure.</P>
<P>This Summer I shall also begin my Brother a Fire-Screen, if he
can contrive the Pattern of it. I wish I may be so fortunate, to please
you both in the Performances which I have undertaken, and then I shall be
sure my Time has not been spent in vain: but if the contrary should
happen, I will immediately go in Search of the great Mr. AESOP, and intreat a
Cup of the Waters of Forgetfulness. Adieu!—I would add more
Nonsense to what I have already wrote, did not your Servant wait.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>The <HI>Leasowes,</HI> 
<DATE><HI>June</HI> 2, 1749.</DATE></DATELINE> 
<SALUTE>Madam,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THO' I may seem to have been extremely idle, I have really taken
no small Pains in endeavouring to obey your Ladyship's Com∣mands. I wish,
when you peruse my Pacquet, you may not rather think me too officious; tho' I
should imagine even that a Crime by no Means equal to Negligence, in any
Affair, wherein you are pleased to employ me. How far I have erred in that
Respect, I am utterly unable to judge, as your Ladyship's Directions were
not very <HI>explicit,</HI> and as I have not been favoured with a single
Syllable from Mr. H—LL, to inform me <HI>whether,</HI> or <HI>how
far</HI> he approved of <HI>any</HI> Alterations. But what Harm do I commit? I
do not call them <HI>Alterations,</HI> which I send; they are only a small
Cargo of different Expressions, which I sincerely desire you will apply
or <HI>reject,</HI> entirely as you think <PB N="92" REF="110"/> proper; nor
shall it give me the least Offence if you reject the whole, if so be you
please to acquit me of Presumption. To speak my <HI>pre∣sent</HI>
Thoughts, I think the Epitaph on Mr. H—LL's Father, and, indeed, all
Epitaphs, should be short. What I have chiefly aimed at in Number I. and
Number II. is to express his <HI>general</HI> Character in few Words.
Neverthe∣less, if Mr. H—LL chuses to have a more <HI>par∣ticular</HI>
Account of his Father, I should think he had better let 
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A Printer then residing at
<HI>Birmingham.</HI></NOTE>ARIS take off about half a Score Copies (on a
single Sheet) of that which your Ladyship has sketched out; after you
have made what Improvements and Additions you shall think advisable; I mean
to give them away amongst a few Friends or Relations. I am not languid, in my
Wishes to advance the Character to as high a Pitch, as Mr. H—LL can
desire, for I believe his Father might de∣serve as good an one, as any
Person in a public Station. But you remember these Lines of Mr.
POPE—according to the Way of the World, 
<Q> 
<L>'Tis from high Life, high Characters are drawn;</L> 
<L>A Saint in Crape is twice a Saint in Lawn,</L> 
<L><PB N="93" REF="111"/>A Judge is just, a Chanc'llor juster
still,</L> 
<L>A Gownman learn'd, a Bishop—what you will;</L> 
<L>Wise, if a Minister; but if a King—</L> 
<L>More wise, more learn'd, more just, more ev'ry
Thing.</L></Q> Where, by the Way, the second and third Verses seem to
dwell upon the same Distinc∣tion—but the whole Paragraph, to the
best of my Memory, is exceedingly beautiful. What there seems of
<HI>Weight</HI> in this, so far as regards the present Purpose, is, that
the Character of a Person in private Life should not be drawn too
pompously. Perhaps, I am <HI>too</HI> scrupulous; however, I wish your
Ladyship may be full as much so, in Regard to my trifling Criticisms.
Does the Affair require Haste, or may it be deferred till I have the Honour
of seeing you?—I will, however, for the present, take Leave of the
Subject.</P>
<P>I lead the unhappy Life of seeing nothing in the Creation so
idle as myself. I am continually piddling in little Matters about my Farm.
What do you think of my publishing Verses once a Week upon my Skreens, for
the Amusement <PB N="94" REF="112"/> of my good Friends the Vulgar?—My
Verses for the present Week are published in VIRGIL's <HI>Grove,</HI> and
run thus:<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Editor is well aware, that the
Substance of these Lines has been repeatedly published, but as this was
pro∣bably the original Reading, he thought that it might not be unacceptable in
this Place.</NOTE> 
<Q>

<L>Here in cool Grot, and mossy Cell,</L>
<L>We Fauns, and tripping Fairies dwell,</L>
<L>Tho' rarely seen by human Eye;</L>
<L>Yet, when the Moon, ascended high,</L>
<L>Darts thro' yon Limes her quiv'ring Beam,</L>
<L>We frisk it near this crystal Stream.</L>
</LG> 
<LG>
<L>Then fear to spoil these sacred Bow'rs,</L>
<L>Nor wound the Shrubs, nor cross the Flow'rs;</L>
<L>So may your Path with Sweets abound,</L>

<L>But ill betide or Nymph or Swain</L>
<L>Who dares these hallow'd Haunts profane!</L>
</LG><BIBL>OBERON.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>My Method is a very cheap one; I paste some Writing-Paper to a
Piece of Deal, then print with a Pen. This serves in Root-Houses, and under
Cover.</P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="113"/>Your Ladyship has been so unkind, as not to
let me know how your Pavilion proceeds; whether you are happy in planning, or
in be∣holding the Plans executed—May I hope to hear soon?—Two
hundred Pounds expended in a Rotund at <HI>Hagley,</HI> on Ionic Pillars! The
Dome of Stone, with thin Lead underneath, to keep out wet. While <HI>I</HI>
propose, or <HI>fancy</HI> I propose to build a Piece of Gothic
Architec∣ture, at Sight of which, all modern Castles near shall bow their
Heads abased, like the other Sheaves to JOSEPH's. I send you the Plan; 'tis
for a Seat on the Bank above my Hermitage, and will amount, on a moderate

<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Percy-Lodge,</HI> 
<DATE><HI>June</HI> 17, 1749.</DATE></DATELINE> 
<SALUTE>Dear Madam,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR Ladyship bids me give you an Ac∣count of what Alterations we
are making at present, but I feel myself much less able to describe the
Fabrick and Furniture of a Palace than a Hermitage, and while I am attending to
all my Lord's Designs there, I fancy I'm no better acquainted with the Effect
it will pro∣duce, than a Person would be with the Beauty of a Piece of
Tapestry, who saw only the wrong Side of it. My Lord will do a good Deal to
the Front of the House, in order to make it appear less like a Prison; he
builds a new Wing on the Right-hand Side of the Gar∣den, which will contain a
Library, Bed-Cham∣ber, Dressing-Room, and a Waiting-Room. I think I told
you, that all the Sashes, Doors, and Ceilings, in both Apartments, must be
in∣tirely <PB N="97" REF="115"/> new, and the Floors in my Lord's; the
Stair-case is very noble, but will require as large a Lanthorn to light it,
as that at <HI>Hough∣ton,</HI> so much celebrated in the News-papers. The
Chimney-Pieces in both Apartments are to be all new, and some of them very
expen∣sive; the Draughts are mighty pretty. My Lord's Bed on the Ground-Floor
is crimson Damask, with Tapestry Hangings; the next Room is furnished
with green Damask, on pur∣pose to set off his Pictures; the next with a
Set of very fine old Hangings of the Duke of NEWCASTLE's Horsemanship, with
his own Pic∣ture, on Horseback, as big as Life; and, now they are clean,
looking neat, as when new. The Parlour to be hung with some very good
Pictures; above Stairs, the great waiting Room, with <HI>Saxon</HI> green Cloth
Chairs, with gilt Nails, and green Lutestring Window Curtains, mar∣ble Table,
and large Glass between the Win∣dows; first Drawing-Room, new crimson
Da∣mask, with Lutestring Window Curtains, two very fine <HI>Japan</HI>
Tables and Glasses between the Windows, with carv'd and gilt Frames; inner
Drawing-Room, Tapestry Hangings, with small Figures very pretty, and as
fresh as new. <PB N="98" REF="116"/> He lays two Rooms together in the right
Wing of the Court, on the ground Floor, in order to make a Chapel, with a
Gothic Wainscot, Cei∣ling, and painted Windows; there is to be a
<HI>Dutch</HI> Stove in it, which is so contrived, as to represent a Tomb
with an Urn upon it. The Court is to be paved, and the Foot-Way al∣tered; and
my Lord is in Treaty for nine Houses on the other Side the Way, in order to
pull them down and build Stables, (for there are none belonging to the House)
whose Gates are intended to open directly over against those of the
Court; if he can agree for this Purchase, he will widen the Street in that
Part about eight Feet. Now, dear Madam, I have obeyed, you in the best Manner
I am able: but upon looking back into my Letter, I find I have forgot my
Bed-Chamber, Dressing-Room and Closet, which one would think, should
not appear least interesting to myself; the first of these is to have
a new Bed-Hanging, and Chairs of crim∣son Queen's Damask; the
Dressing-Room, which has two large Sashes, will have Tapestry Hangings
and green Damask Chairs; the Clo∣set, which is small, and has only one
Sash, ex∣actly facing the Chimney, furnished with paint∣ed 
<PB N="99" REF="117"/> Paper; the Chimney-Piece in the Dressing-Room, is to
be of Statuary-Marble and <HI>Giallo di Siering,</HI> and just in the Front
of it, the Fable of the Stork inviting the Fox to Dinner, very neatly carved;
there is another little Waiting-Room, at this End of the Apartment, for the
Groom of the Chambers to be in, in the Morn∣ing, or, when I'm not in Form, in
the Evening. To return to my <HI>Bergerie,</HI> nothing has been done in it
this Summer, nor have I the Heart to propose any Thing, for I'm actually
frightened with the Sum my Lord is laying out, about
<HI>Nor∣thumberland-House</HI>; and I find, by living long in strait
Circumstances, one contracts a Narrow∣ness of Mind, which makes launching
out at once into great Expence, not appear so desirable, as it would be
thought by young, gay People. The cold North Winds have blighted and ruined the
Beauty of my Roses for the Remainder of this Year, and starved all the
various Flowers, which used to adorn our Clumps and Borders. The Time of our
going into <HI>Sussex</HI> remains unfixed; but I fancy it will be in about
a Month: and we have taken a new House in <HI>Bath,</HI> for the first Week
in <HI>September,</HI> so that instead of en∣joying my peaceful Shades, as
I used to do, <PB N="100" REF="118"/> I appear engaged in a tedious
Pilgrimage, and am looking (over the Charms of the Summer Month) to a resting
Place in <HI>Northumberland-House,</HI> and where, perhaps, I may never come;
the probability is much stronger against me, than it was, this Time five
Years, against my ever-lamented BEAUCHAMP; and indeed I am far from well at
present, having a most terrible Cough and Cold, with a continual Head-ach
and Sickness at my Stomach.</P>
<P>I am glad to hear, that Mrs. W—L's seem∣ing Neglect did not
proceed from her own Heart, but the Hardness of another's, which is a
Stranger to all that is gentle or humane. I am persuaded, your Improvements
will add great Beauty to your Habitation, and would make me long to see it,
if I were a movable Being, but you know I never was fond of tra∣velling, and I
cannot take a Journey now, but as the <HI>Rhodian Colossus</HI> might do.
Among all my Lord's Acquisitions, none has given me more Pleasure than his
Chaplain, who is be∣tween sixty and seventy, very well bred, strictly
pious, and they say, is an admirable Scholar; has a Genius for all the polite
Arts, is a good <PB N="101" REF="119"/> Judge of Poetry, has read a prodigious
deal, is very <HI>modest,</HI> and at the same Time constant∣ly chearful,
but naturally inclined to a solitary Country Life; in short, we are all
fond of his Company, from my Lord to the lowest Servant in the House. I am
sure you are tired of my Obedience by this Time, and will be glad to see me
come to a Conclusion, by subscribing my∣self,</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXVIII. Mr. WHISTLER to W. SHENSTONE, Esq.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Whitchurch,</HI> 
<DATE><HI>Oct.</HI> 7, 1749.</DATE></DATELINE> 
<SALUTE>Dear Mr. SHENSTONE,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE buried a Friend, who has made me his Executor, and, of
consequence, I have had a good deal of Fatigue. I tell you this thus
abruptly, because I could not have wrote a Sentence without blushing, till
I had, in my Opinion, made a reasonable Excuse for my seeming Neglect of
you; you, who so abun∣dantly obliged me by your last Favour. The Flowers
were the finest I have seen this Season, though I have seen those of
a celebrated Flo∣rist this Year—inferior in no Respect, and
supe∣rior in this, (which weighs much with me) that they will not fade. Such
is the Advantage of Art, the Offspring of the Mind, above the perishable
Beauties of Nature. I am sure they shall never perish in my Hands, for I
shall even piously transmit them down to Posterity, 
<PB N="103" REF="121"/> as they deserve. You are continually finding out
some new Way to ravish your Friends, and yet that seems needless,
since in your old one, I mean that of Wit, you seem to be infinite. All
this is so, and so superlatively so, that I begin to think myself a
Fool to hold so unequal a Cor∣respondence. I am a Gainer in one Respect,
but I am certainly a Loser in another. It is a great Proof of my Affection to
you however, for none but mean Souls would, otherwise, prefer their
Pleasure to their Honour. To speak in the most sincere Manner, I never
am so sensible of my own Inability, as when I take one of your Letters
before me to answer it. Emulation immediately ceases, and then you cannot
wonder if I fall even below the Bathos of my own Genius.</P>
<P>I know you are, by this Time, impatient to hear what Friend I have
lost. It is Mr. BROOKER, of whom you have often heard me speak. I have
<HI>got,</HI> indeed, by his Death, but I assure you, no Gain would be
sufficient to make me unconcerned at the Loss of a Friend—so far
from it, that the Acquisition only adds <PB N="104" REF="122"/> to the
Tenderness, and consequently to the Re∣gret.</P>
<P>Now I must return to the old Burthen. When shall I see
you?—I long to see you—'Tis more than GARRICK playing RICHARD to
see you—the next highest Pitch my Imagination can soar. I long too
to see your Alterations, which I look upon as so many of your visible
Ideas.</P>
<P>As for my Retreat, it is not worth descri∣bing; or, to describe
it at once, I may call it a Band-Box, <HI>viz.</HI> "The Citizen's Delight."
However, I wish you were in it: and now let me propose my Scheme. It is the
same I pro∣posed last Year. It is to meet either here, or at
<HI>London,</HI> first; for I shall be alternately at both Places, and will
order my Route at your Pleasure. I purpose going soon; but a Let∣ter from
you shall determine my Schemes at any Time. Though if I should be at
<HI>London,</HI> and you would come thither first, and after∣wards with me to
<HI>Whitchurch,</HI> it would com∣pleat my Wishes, for I long to be at both
Places with you. My Residence in <HI>London</HI> is at Mr. PEARETH's
Chambers, <HI>King's-Bench-Walks,</HI> <PB N="105" REF="123"/> No. 7; but direct
to me at <HI>Whitchurch</HI> as yet.</P>
<P>If you have any Vanity, it must be exquisitely fed by the
smallest Favour from Lady LUXBO∣ROUGH. If you have a Taste for
Pleasure, refined to the highest Degree, (Why did I say, <HI>If?)</HI> by
all Accounts, her Politeness must gra∣tify it to the full. When I say
this, I don't speak in the Gross; I don't say, that this Per∣son or the
other said she was a Wonder, (tho' that I can aver too) but I go upon
better Grounds for my Assertion, than general Applause; I go upon
Particulars, from which I have formed a Character that must be beautiful.</P>
<P>You complain of Mr. —. I told him of it, but don't know
whether he has made an At∣tonement. I am a good deal picqued at him myself.
Tho' we live next Door to each other, he has spent but one Evening with me
since he has been at —, and that was after a thousand
Remonstrances, and much against his Will. He neglects every Body for his
Wife; in short, <HI>he is no more.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="124"/>I hope you will favour me with a Line soon,
and that it may bring 
<Q REND="inline">"sweet Boadments."</Q> All Compliments wait on
you. With these I must conclude, applauding myself, whenever I re∣flect
that I am</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXIX. The Duchess of SOMERSET to Lady

<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Percy-Lodge,</HI> 
<DATE><HI>Jan.</HI> 21, 1749-50.</DATE></DATELINE> 
<SALUTE>Dear Madam,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHEN I look upon the Date of your Letter, it puts me both out of
Coun∣tenance and Patience with myself. Your Letter found me at <HI>Bath,</HI>
from whence, I thank God, my Lord is returned with his Health and Ap∣petite 
<PB N="107" REF="125"/> much improved; and I hope, the good Effects of this
Journey, will continue longer than those of the preceding Years. Our
Ser∣vants and Goods have all been removed to <HI>Northumberland-House,</HI>
since before Michaelmas, but when we shall get into it ourselves, is yet
among the Secrets of Fate. It is still hid with Scaffolds towards the Street,
but by the Plan, and the little I could see of it when I was in
<HI>London,</HI> on the King's Birth-Day, it will be very handsome, and
indeed it should, my Lord destined 10,000<HI>l.</HI> for the Alterations;
but I believe he has by this Time experienced, that he deceived himself, at
not setting it at above double; for though the House itself will not
cost, perhaps, above 14.000<HI>l.</HI> yet the Houses he has purchased,
in order to widen the Street and build his Sta∣bles, and the Remainder of the
Duke of CHAN∣DOS's grant for <HI>Scotland-Yard,</HI> which he is in Treaty for,
in order to carry down his Garden, and open a View from his House to the
<HI>Thames,</HI> will cost at least as much more. Mean Time, you may
guess our poor <HI>Bergerie</HI> has been neg∣lected, and except a very
pretty and convenient Hot-House for Pine-Apples, has had no addi∣tional
Ornament of any Kind. We pass this <PB N="108" REF="126"/> Winter here, which
I should not regret at any other Time but as Lady BETTY<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The late Duchess of NORTHUMBERLAND.</NOTE> is to lie in, and is
already gone a Month past her Reckon∣ing, I should like to be nearer to
her. I was not eight and forty Hours in Town, when I went to be presented, on
my Lord's new Earl∣doms, and to make my Appearance on the Birth-Day; for I went
from hence at Seven on the <HI>Sunday</HI> Morning, and was presented that
Day at Noon, and on the <HI>Monday,</HI> as soon as the Drawing-Room was
over, undressed and came back directly. I lay at Sir HUGH SMITHSON's, for I
could not have a Room at <HI>Northumberland-House,</HI> and I have never
seen <HI>London</HI> since. We have the most glorious Weather that I
believe was ever seen in Winter: but, alas! I can only admire it from my
Windows, being under Dr. SHAW's Hands, for the ill Consequence of a Fall,
which I had before I went to <HI>Bath,</HI> by a Servant heedlessly taking
away a Chair, just as I was going to sit down, and which I took too little
Care of at first, so I am now forbid all Sort of Exercise, which gives me
but a melan∣choly Prospect, as to my Health, for the fu∣ture: but God's Will
be done! and I hope I <PB N="109" REF="127"/> shall chearfully submit to the
Event, whatever it be.</P>
<P>Have you seen a little <HI>French</HI> Book called <HI>Con∣seils
à une Amie,</HI> said to be written by Madame de POMPADOUR: the Name
of the Author will not induce you to expect any very exalted Sentiments of
Religion or Morality; but it contains good Rules for making a proper Figure in
High-Life. I have also had the Letters of Monsieur RACINE LE PERE, and
some Me∣moirs of his Life, by his Son, lent me; and they give me a greater
Esteem for him as a Man, than as the Author of <HI>Ester and Athaliah.</HI>
I hope you have seen my old Acquaintance, the Minister of B—'s
Answer to Dr. MIDDLETON's <HI>Free Enquiry about Miracles.</HI> I cannot
ima∣gine how he can reply to it, without owning himself a Deist, or
explaining some of his Innu∣endos in a different Way to what they appear at
first Sight. Mr. and Mrs. WYMONDESOLD's handsome Behaviour to you, dear
Madam, gives me a good Opinion of them both. I be∣lieve I shall never have
reason to alter that which I have formed of my Lord L— for some Years
past; and as to that I strove to enter∣tain <PB N="110" REF="128"/> of him
before, 'twas the Work of Art, and a <HI>Contre-coeur.</HI> As to your Son, I
think he does not act of himself. I am sorry to hear Mr. SHENSTONE has been
so ill, but I hope his Muse has not left him; I am sure yours has not; I
am confident she attended you very agreeably upon his Bench. Mr. LINDSEY, my
Lord's Chaplain, (who by the Way is a very good Judge, and a pretty Sort of
Man) prefers his Ode on Autumn to almost every modern Performance. My Lord
sends you his Compli∣ments; and I am, with a very sincere Regard,</P>

<DATE><HI>Feb.</HI> 26, 1750-1.</DATE></DATELINE> 
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Return you a Multitude of Thanks for the Favour of your last
Letter to me. I think you seem to have had as solitary a Winter as we have
at <HI>Broom.</HI> This is the Season a Town Life is vastly preferable to
that of the Country; the Country now is only fit for Poachers and Game-keepers.
Like old DARBY and JOAN, we live now upon the Thoughts of past Pleasures; 
<Q> 
<L>In fondly meditating o'er</L> 
<L>Past Pleasures, and in hoping more.</L></Q> However, we have
two Amusements which ne∣ver fail us, and those are Reading and Music. In
order that we may enjoy the latter in a great∣er Degree than we have done of
late, we have got Mr. G— over sometimes, you know, who has procured us
a new Spinnet, and he says, <PB N="112" REF="130"/> he'll make us proficient
in the Art of Music presently, provided we will but be diligent.</P>
<P>I have sent for the Pamphlet that is wrote against Mr.
G—'s Compositions. As he's my Master, I have a Curiosity to it. He
says, it pulls him all to Pieces. I can't tell what Ge∣nius he has for
composing Music, but certainly he's a very good Music-Master. As a
Compa∣nion, I do not much admire him: I think he's a disagreeable Man; very
mercenary; always full of Esteem for himself, and of Contempt for all
others; and does not consider, that it is almost as glorious to acknowledge
Merit in other Persons, as to have it oneself: but he sets good
Lessons, so I'll bear with him; as Lord FOPPINGTON tells his
Shoemaker— 
<Q REND="inline">"Now by all that's great and powerful, thou art a
most incomprehensible Coxcomb; but thou makest good Shoes, so I'll bear
with thee."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sir JOHN VANBURGH's Comedy of the
<HI>Relapse.</HI></NOTE></Q> </P>
<P>Pray have you seen the Memoirs of the House of
<HI>Brandenburgh</HI> in <HI>English,</HI> by the King of
<HI>Prussia?</HI> I have some Thoughts of buying <PB N="113" REF="131"/>
the "<HI>Oeconomy of Life,</HI>"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A most excellent
little Work published about this Time by Mr. R. DODSLEY, and by most

should be glad of your Opinion of it first: it is wrote in the Manner of
SOLOMON's <HI>Proverbs,</HI> which I think is a pretty one. I am very glad to
hear that Lady LUXBOROUGH has her Health. The Family at <HI>A—n</HI> are

<OPENER><DATELINE>The <HI>Leasowes,</HI> 
<DATE><HI>March,</HI> 1750-1.</DATE></DATELINE> 
<SALUTE>Madam,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I CAN very faithfully assure your Ladyship, that the
Pleasure I received from your <HI>French</HI> Letter was equal to what I
expected; and as I can hardly form an Expression that implies my 
<PB N="114" REF="132"/> Approbation more fully, I ought, perhaps, to add nothing
more upon this Head. How∣ever, I can ill avoid being more explicit; for
besides that your Choice of Words gives me an agreeable Idea of the
<HI>French</HI> Language, there is I don't know what Kind of Pleasure
arises upon seeing common or domestic Affairs treated of in a Language
foreign to one's own. I wish it may not one Day tempt me to hazard a few
<HI>French</HI> Lines to your Ladyship, altho' I have, in a great Measure,
forgot the Termination of my Moods and Tenses, and should of course make
a thousand Blunders, in regard to the proper Idiom: but if I should, I
trust your Ladyship would be prevailed upon to burn what I wrote
immediately. Surely it is either owing to the Delicacy of your Choice, or the
<HI>French</HI> have great Numbers of Words more ex∣pressive than our own:
for Instance 
<Q REND="inline">"<HI>trop bonne pour avoir Besoin de cet
Assaisonnement</HI>;"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"> 
<Q REND="inline">"Too good to stand in need of this
Recommendation."</Q></NOTE></Q> I know not of any <HI>English</HI> Word that
would be proper here besides Recommendation, which is greatly inferior. I
have observed the same of many others. But I confine my Partiality to their
<HI>Prose,</HI> and I dare say your Ladyship (who <PB N="115" REF="133"/>
knows so well all the Beauties of their Lan∣guage) is also not unacquainted
with the Im∣perfections of it; by which Means you find yourself so well
enabled to disguise the latter, at the same Time that you are
displaying the former. Notwithstanding the supposed Qua∣lifications of
the GLUMS and the GAWRIES ex∣cites one's Curiosity, the Book does not, I
think, deserve a Place in your Ladyship's Library, and I would not have you
purchase it. It makes two Volumes in 12mo. Price 6s. It came into my Way,
so I read it, giving it just Atten∣tion enough to let it amuse me with
the imagi∣nary Scenes it describes. As to what I said of the
<HI>Scribbleriad,</HI> you will observe, I had read nothing but a few
Quotations, and am now to request your Ladyship's Opinion, who have
re∣ceived the Book. Believe me, my Lady, I am not lazy in <HI>Mind.</HI> I long
for nothing so much as bodily Health and Spirits, to be able to ac∣quit
myself better of my Share of the Corre∣spondence, and to deserve the
Vivacity of yours somewhat more than I do. But when I shall be able to
exchange the Cypress Grove for the more agreeable Verdure of the Myrtle or
the Laurel, is a Question I cannot pretend to solve—Very 
<PB N="116" REF="134"/> pedantic truly this!—But to proceed: I wrote many
ludicrous Things at College, and in the former Part of my Life, and one or two
of these am I thinking to enclose during this insipid Season; perhaps
taking, like Woodcocks, the Advantage of a Fog, they may hope at such a Time
for something better Quarter, though, to speak the Truth, they are much too
silly, and your Judgment too penetrating, to give them any Room for such an
Expectation. As to printing, I will not say that I never intend it, but I
must first be able to spend a few Weeks with my Friend GRAVES, who is a
Person of great Delicacy, and whose Friendship may, per∣haps, induce him
to examine my Trifles with some Attention, no very agreeable Task to him or
any one else. Mean Time, the Complaint you make of your present Want of
Amusement, gives me an Occasion to pour in Floods of my <HI>written</HI>
Impertinence. The <HI>Progress of Taste</HI> I meant to shew you long
ago. The <HI>Snuff-Box</HI> (which by interweaving another Poem or two, is now,
I see, a mere Piece of Patch-Work) ap∣pears before you for no other Reason
in the World, but that it happens to be transcribed in the same Book with
the former; and is interested <PB N="117" REF="135"/> in my desiring you not
to read a Line of it. I send also the Ode I first mentioned to the
Du∣chess,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"<HI>Rural Elegance,</HI>" an Ode to the
late Duchess of SOMERSET. See SHENSTONE's Works, Vol. i, Page 105.</NOTE> and
would ask, in the first Place, whether it <HI>deserves</HI> Correction?
If you would not choose I should immediately destroy it, will you be so
Kind as to mark any Improprieties, or propose any Improvements to me? I hope
you will be in no concern about defacing the Copy, in that Case, for I would
write it over ever so often, if I could by that Means add a Syllable that was
more expressive of my Veneration for her Grace, or that tended to give her
a Mo∣ment's Amusement. I calculated the <HI>Subject</HI> as well as I could;
but I am fearful you will discover nothing but common-place Thoughts. I think
most of my Verses smell of nothing but Field-Flowers, and considering
how I spend my Time, they can scarce do otherwise.</P>
<P>A Word more, in regard to the proposed Al∣teration in your Room.
If your Ladyship does not choose to go to the Expence of a carved Frame,
what think you of a white oval Frame to your Glass in the middle, and a
Festoon on <PB N="118" REF="136"/> each Side; this with the Stucco need amount
to no more than four Guineas. But the Room is mighty well as it <HI>is,</HI>
and you are yourself the Judge, whether the Expence of the Altera∣tion would
afford you an answerable Amuse∣ment. I am greatly pleased with what your
Ladyship mentions of coming to the <HI>Leasowes</HI>; for tho' you will
see but little new this Year, yet by allowing yourself some little Time,
you will see the same with much greater Ease than you could before; and
if I should add, Pleasure, I hope you will allow it to my Fond∣ness for a
Place that has engrossed my Care so long. You complain, Madam, of the
Want of fresh Ideas, (which I never yet observed in your Conversation or
Letters at any Time or Tide) guess, however, what must be <HI>my</HI>
Case, who see nothing from Day to Day but 
<Q> 
<L>Bleak Mountains and wild staring Rocks,</L> 
<L>The wretched Result of my Pains;</L> 
<L>The Swains, greater Brutes than their Flocks,</L> 
<L>And the Nymphs as polite as the Swains—</L></Q> I once
thought of inscribing these on a Seat, but now my very Spleen forsakes
me.</P>

<DATE><HI>May</HI> 24, 1751.</DATE></DATELINE> 
<SALUTE>Dear Madam,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Hasten to acquaint your Ladyship, that my Brother is now
greatly better, and, is, we all hope, in a fair Way of Recovery.</P>
<P>What small Hopes I have entertained for most Part of the Time
since I wrote last to <HI>Barrels,</HI> have been rather owing to a Kind of
Self-Flattery, and an Unwillingness to De∣spair, than any proper
Foundation—but these three Days, his Disorder is so much abated,
that they seem to receive some Sanction from <HI>Reason</HI>; not that I
am entirely free from Ap∣prehensions. The asthmatical Disorder is fallen
down into his Legs, where it continues at pre∣sent. But what by Means of
Ass's Milk, which agrees with him, the Advantage of a few Days, in which he
has been carried Sedan-Fashion <PB N="120" REF="138"/> about my Grounds, and
the most scrupulous Care, in regard to what we suffer him to eat or
drink, his Spirits, Pulse and Com∣plexion are astonishingly recovered,
and his Strength and Stomach proportionably restored.</P>
<P>I will not detain your Ladyship any longer on this Head, than to
acquaint you, that I have thought about writing to <HI>Barrels</HI> every Day
since your Servant was here; but finding all along, such frequent Changes
in the Disor∣der, and being utterly incapable to give your Ladyship any
<HI>satisfactory</HI> Account, I had not the Spirit to set Pen to
Paper.</P>
<P>This has been to me the most disagreeable Season, for a
Continuance, I ever spent in my Life; betwixt sleepless Nights, painful
Ap∣prehensions, constant Solicitude, Confinement, and an entire Alteration
in regard to my Way of Life, I found my own Situation not a little endangered:
but as the original Cause begins to cease, I hope the Effect will. I might
have added to the former Vexations, the Difficulty of procuring good Advice,
and the no less Difficulty of prevailing on my Brother to fol∣low 
<PB N="121" REF="139"/> it. Such Persons as he ought always to be well; I
mean, to guard more than <HI>others</HI> against Diseases, as they have
so little Pa∣tience in reserve to submit to the Means of Cure.</P>
<P>But to lead your Ladyship from the sick Room into the open Air a
little—I am now beginning, for the first Time, to brush up my Walks.
The Trees and Shrubs are in full Bloom all of a sudden; I mean, so far as
concerns the green Leaves, for the latter have not yet flowered. The Servants
are now very busy in cleaning my Grove, &amp;c. whither I stray now two or
three Times a Day, with great Complacency. I doubt the Death of poor Mr.
H—LL's Brother will occasion him much worldly Perplexity, as well as
Concern, at present: I would otherwise press him to spend a Week with
me at the <HI>Leasowes,</HI> as some Kind of Relief to him, and a great
Plea∣sure to us. I think a Change of Place, after such an Affliction, is
very often of no small Service. That Book of Mr. PEARSALL's which your
Ladyship subscribed for, is come out, I hear, but I have had no Copies
sent yet. Your <PB N="122" REF="140"/> Ladyship, I know, intended to oblige
<HI>me</HI> by your Subscription, and THAT Point you can never fail to
obtain—more I am not at Liberty to say. You will please to mention
this Publica∣tion to Mr. H—LL; I sent <HI>his</HI> Name, tho' I am not
<HI>sure</HI> that he subscribed: but I know he would be the readiest
of Men to serve an old Schoolfellow. Would your Ladyship be so Kind as to
lend me POMPEY <HI>the Little?</HI> I have read, as I said before, nothing
but Physic-Books for these last six Weeks, and I want now to be
indulged with somewhat more amusing. I won't pretend to your Ladyship
that I am a very great <HI>Physician,</HI> but I consider myself as
qua∣lified to make the best <HI>Nurse</HI> of any body in the three
Kingdoms. I hope soon to be able to adjust a Time, when I may have the
long∣wished-for Happiness of waiting on your Lady∣ship at the
<HI>Leasowes.</HI> In the mean Time, I am to return my Brother's Thanks with
my own, for every obliging Instance of your Regard, and to subscribe
myself inviolably</P>

W. SHENSTONE.</SIGNED> <POSTSCRIPT>
<PB N="123" REF="141"/>
<P>P. S. <HI>May</HI> 25. I should have sent the fore∣going
Account yesterday, when it was wrote; but I find nothing to add hitherto,
that may <HI>discolour</HI> the favourable Relation I have been giving of my
Brother's Recovery. I <HI>will</HI> yet hope that there is some good in
reserve for us, which may in <HI>some Measure,</HI> compensate for the
gloomy Season we have past—I don't know from what Quarter, but I'll
still confide—I hope your Ladyship does.</P>
<P>I did not propose to do <HI>much</HI> about my House this
Year, and I now shall do <HI>nothing.</HI> But I know your Ladyship will
find some Pleasure in the Conjecture, that the Money which might have been
expended upon Rooms or Furni∣ture, has been spent with some Effect upon my
Brother's Recovery; without which, the <HI>Leasowes</HI> would have afforded
no Pleasure of one while. I hope, with this good Weather, your Ladyship's
wonted Spirits will return; I hope, also, that I shall henceforth be able
to cor∣respond with you upon more agreeable Subjects than I could of late.
Miss DOLMAN desired her Compliments when she was here last, which 
<PB N="124" REF="142"/> was about a Week ago. I cannot yet write with any Sort

<P>I Return you the Collection of Poems, which you were so kind as to

Perusal of them.</P>
<P>If I did not expect the Pleasure of seeing them soon again in

really design those charming 
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Elegies published in Mr. SHENSTONE's

and that they will no longer be concealed in the little secret Box, from

<P>Sometime before my Lord DUDLEY sets out for <HI>London,</HI> my
Brother and I flatter ourselves, that he and Miss LEA will come to

there, whenever they in∣tend us the Honour of a Visit.</P>
<P>I came Home from the <HI>Grange</HI> so much ena∣moured with the
Concert I heard there, that the Desire I had before of being a Performer in
such a one has, if possible, taken a deeper Root. CLARENDON calls
Ambition a Weed, which, he says, is apt to grow in the best Soils, so I
will not be wholly void of it; I will be ambi∣tious of attaining to some
Knowledge of two Things, namely, Music and the <HI>French</HI> Lan∣guage; and
in order to do the latter, I believe my Brother and I shall be so very
extravagant, as to have a <HI>French</HI> Master attend us at <HI>Broom,</HI>
as frequently as we have G—M to teach as Music now.</P>
<P><PB N="126" REF="144"/>How do you approve of the Scheme of our having

<SALUTE>Dear Madam,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAD wrote to your Ladyship long before this Time, to acknowledge
the Kindness of your Letter and Present: but I have a most deplorable
Account to give of my Delay, and what so good a Friend as yourself will not
read without a Sigh. Alas, dear Madam, I have lost my only Brother! A more
sincere or truly affectionate one never bore the Name. I cannot now add more;
tho' I should not want Matter to expatiate upon his Merit, if I were not at
the same Time to revive and lament the Loss of it. He is gone <HI>before
me</HI> in the very Prime of his Days, and ere the Force of his
Understanding, or the Benevolence of his Heart has been half exerted or
known.</P>
<P><PB N="128" REF="146"/>Future Letters, and other Conversations, may
afford me an Opportunity to pour out all my Soul; at present, I am not enough
Ma∣ster of myself. I find all my Views intercept∣ed: my Schemes,
Measures, and even my Heart itself, to be well nigh broken. I have lost
that Spirit of a Man, which alone is able to sustain his Infirmities. Every
Object round me, that was once the Source of my Amuse∣ment, revives a Train
of Ideas that I can hardly render supportable. I procure a Set of low Friends
to chat around me, and call off my Attention. But the greatest Relief I have
found, since the fatal Close of <HI>November,</HI> is what I have drawn
from Stupefaction.</P>
<P>Pardon me, my good Lady; I do not mean to make a Display of my
Affliction. I mention it, that you may account for, and excuse any
Omissions or Improprieties in your unfortu∣nate Correspondent.</P>
<P>Since this unhappy Catastrophe, it has been my Lot to hear of one
that must nearly af∣fect your Ladyship. Believe me, my honoured Lady, I am
far from an unconcerned Observer <PB N="129" REF="147"/> of Events, that
must afford you either Pleasure or Pain. But I am not in a Condition to
<HI>re∣ceive</HI> Relief, and how can I pretend to <HI>give</HI> it? One Thing,
however, I will suggest—I think <HI>CAESAR</HI> confessed at an
earlier Period of Life than what my Lord BOLINGBROKE arrived at, that he had
lived enough, either in regard to Nature or to Glory.</P>
<P>During the Height of our Afflictions, we can scarce believe it
possible they should ever wear off. In my Case, there are some
Parti∣culars which render it improbable they should. Yet Time, we find,
alleviates the Misfortunes of others, and it is fitting we should hope
im∣plicitly, that it may some how diminish our own.</P>
<P>I will excuse your Ladyship from dwelling upon the Subject.
Assure me only of the Con∣tinuance of your Esteem, and it will be of
great∣er Service than whole Volumes of Philosophy.</P>
<P>Pray be so good as to write or dictate a Let∣ter to me. I
earnestly pray that it may be <PB N="130" REF="148"/> the former, I am, dear
Madam, with all the Tenderness of my present State of Mind, your</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>most obliged, faithful, and very affectionate
Servant, W. SHENSTONE.</SIGNED> <POSTSCRIPT>
<P>This is the third Time I have begun this Letter, without being
able to finish it till now. If your Ladyship will favour me with a Line, I
hope to be able to answer it without the same Difficulty.</P>
<P>I have some Thoughts of waiting on you at <HI>Barrels</HI> for a
Week, when I hear you are come down, but I have had a Kind of nervous Fever,
for which I have been taking Medicines. This I did, tho' I knew at the same
Time how ineffectual they must prove. I was taking Drugs from the Shop to
cure Anxiety of the Mind.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXXV. Mr. WHISTLER to W. SHENSTONE, Esq.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Whitchurch,</HI> 
<DATE><HI>June</HI> 2, 1752.</DATE></DATELINE> 
<SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>MR. GRAVES has lately set me right as to a Mistake, which
otherwise I might have remained in much longer. As I hope to live, I had
quite forgot my Promise of writing to you from <HI>London,</HI> and so
wondered I did not hear from you. But upon his men∣tioning it, I immediately,
to my great Con∣fusion, recollected my Error. I felt a great deal of
Uneasiness, while I imagined the Fault to lie at your Door; but I
assure you, much more, since I find it to be at my own. In∣gratitude is
what I most abhor; and I must be a Monster, to slight such a Favour
as your last to me, and from such a Friend. Pray believe me incapable of
it, or of possessing a serene Mind, while there should be any
Misun∣derstanding between you and me. I am like∣wise sincerely
concerned for the Death of your Bro∣ther, especially as Mr. GRAVES says, it
touched <PB N="132" REF="150"/> you so nearly, consequently I should
advise you to change the Place a little after so melancholy an Affair; and
I am sure you can find in no Place, <HI>one</HI> who would be more
solicitous to divert you than at <HI>Whitchurch.</HI> I can't ask that
Favour of you, because I am so much in Debt to you already. But it would
give me a double Pleasure, since I believe at present it might be
beneficial to you. For my own Part, I long to wait on you; but my Mother's
State of Health is so bad, that I must not think of gratifying that
Passion this Summer; tho' I can hardly lay that Hope aside, or forbear
saying, that a small Altera∣tion in her for the better would make me
pur∣sue it. I have got a little Chaise, which at present I am much
pleased with, and I assure you, its Wheels have a natural
<HI>Penchant</HI> to run to the <HI>Leasowes.</HI></P>
<P>I wish'd for you much at <HI>London.</HI> Plays are well worth
seeing now. I reckon those who can't be pleased with the present
Per∣formances of the Stage, are too delicate ever to be pleased. There are a
great many very good Actors, and some (GARRICK and Mrs. CIBBER) acknowledged
to exceed all that ever <PB N="133" REF="151"/> have been. You must come once
more in∣to the World, I mean to <HI>London</HI>; I am sure it will do you
good: I find the Benefit of it myself; Change of Place gives me Spirits for
the Year, which, I find, fail me very much without—Don't let us grow old
if we can help it; and I think Variety and new Scenes are the most likely to
keep us young, at least produce the Effects of Youth. I own Life is dull at
best, and therefore it is the wisest Way to vary it as much as
possible. The most stupid Vulgar (both high and low) find their Account
in this Method. Then you must find a double Pleasure in it, who know how to
vary it so elegantly, as to entertain others as well as yourself. I
assure you, you succeeded so well as to the first, when you were
here, that your Praises are still blooming; the agree∣able Impression
still remains on all. I long to see you, and hope to hear from you. Pray
harbour no ill Thought of me, for if I have erred, it was, I assure you,
from Mistake or Forgetfulness, and not with Intention. I never did, nor
ever can, mean Ill or Disrepect to dear Mr. SHENSTONE, but shall ever be
his most sincere Friend and humble Servant,</P>

<DATE><HI>June</HI> 6, 1752.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>MY Conversation, dear Lady LUXBOROUGH, is by no Means equal to the
Reception I find at <HI>Barrels,</HI> and if you return me Thanks upon
<HI>that</HI> Score, you make me doubly sensi∣ble how unable I am to make a
due Ac∣knowledgement.</P>
<P>The Day after I left <HI>Barrels,</HI> I had a Morning Visit from
Admiral SMITH, Captain WHOOD, Mrs. STANLEY, and her two Daugh∣ters, who engaged
me to dine with Sir G. <PB N="135" REF="153"/> LYTTELTON. These are Ladies of
Taste, I think; but Admiral SMITH is the Delight of Mankind! I forgot to
mention Mr. MILLER, who seems to recommend my Walks with great Cordiality. I
see they condescend to look upon <HI>modern</HI> Plans at <HI>Hagley,</HI>
and if they build anew, I suppose it will be in that Style.</P>
<P>Since this I have seen a good deal of Com∣pany, more of whom
arrive to see my <HI>Walks</HI> than <HI>me</HI>; yet I am not jealous or
invidious: my Walks are truly more deserving of this Favour.</P>
<P>Yesterday, I had the Company of Miss LEA, and Mr. HILTON, a very
modest and ingenious Man, who came with Lord DUD∣LEY from <HI>London</HI>;
besides two other Parties of Visitants, who engrossed my whole Day.</P>
<P>And now I sit down by <HI>Five</HI> in the Morn∣ing to answer
your Queries concerning the <HI>Papier-Machée.</HI> It is bought of Mr.
BROM∣WICH, at the <HI>Golden-Lion,</HI> upon <HI>Ludgate-Hill.</HI> What you
will want, will be an Ornament <PB N="136" REF="154"/> for the Middle, and four
Spandrells for the Corners. I have taken down the Pine-Apple from the middle of
my Cieling, and send it you to see, together with some other Orna∣ments
which were never yet fixed up. They will cost (I mean a middle and four
corner Ornaments) somewhere about eight Shillings. You may ornament it
<HI>more</HI> or <HI>less</HI> tho' as you please. As to the Cracks of your
Cieling, (which I don't remember) if they are not violently bad, they may be
mended by a com∣mon Mason, and the <HI>Colour</HI> will disguise them. As
for putting them up, I will send you over a very agreeable Neighbour of mine,
who was once an eminent Upholsterer, but now lives upon his Fortune, who
seems glad of the Op∣portunity it will give him to see <HI>Barrels,</HI>
and the Honour it will afford him of being ser∣viceable to your Ladyship.
They should be painted with Flake White and thin Starch; but all this he will
manage to your entire Satis∣faction. He is a Person of Taste, has seen a
good deal of Life; and tho' he has had his Share of Difficulties, always
chearful. You must not offer him any Thing. Thus have I been as short as I
can, in pointing out <PB N="137" REF="155"/> your quickest Method of
embellishing your Cieling. The whole Cove (except the Moul∣ding) should be
washed with Oker; but this you may defer, if you please, till Mr. PIXELL
arrives.</P>
<P>I beg my Thanks to Mrs. WEYMONDE∣SOLD, for her kind Remembrance of
me: am a little fearful her Visit will be too late in the Year; but 'tis in
Mrs. WEYMONDESOLD's Power to make <HI>all</HI> Seasons pleasing.</P>
<P>My Lord DUDLEY will be extremely glad to wait on Mr. OUTING: but he
must come hither first, and we will adjust the Remain∣der.</P>
<P>I have taken the Liberty to send this by my Servant Girl, who is
desirous to see her Sister and <HI>Barrels</HI>; and really my Man is
so much Assistant in the Way of fitting up my Room (which engages me)
that I could very ill spare him.</P>
<P>I hope Mr. PRICE is recovered, by the Men∣tion you make of his going
again to <HI>London.</HI> I <PB N="138" REF="156"/> did not merely ask, but
wish to see him here. And now I must leave your Ladyship for the
Company of my Carpenters; yet am ever <HI>uniformly</HI> your Ladyship's
most obliged</P>

<DATE><HI>Aug.</HI> 16, 1752.</DATE></DATELINE> 
<SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS I promised to write to you soon, I hope you will excuse the
Haste and Errors of this Epistle. I was almost wet through before I
reached <HI>Birmingham</HI> last <HI>Wednesday,</HI> where I eat a Mouthful
of Dinner at my Inn, and proceeded to <HI>Solihull:</HI> there I stopt, and
was told by the Landlady, I should be too late for the Races at
<HI>Warwick,</HI> if I did not make haste. I thanked her, and proceeded to 
<PB N="139" REF="157"/> Mr. WREN's, who gave me a very friendly Reception, and
asked me to stay all Night, which I immediately accepted. We walked and
talked much; he praised Gloom and So∣litude, and I fine Prospects: not but
that (I told him) sometimes I could relish a <HI>grave</HI> Scene, and lo!
he opens a Door, and turned me into the Church-Yard, which he said was full
of <HI>Graves,</HI> and desired me to tell you the same. Great Alterations
might be made there, which he will never do. Next Day, after Breakfast, I
took my Leave, and reached <HI>Warwick,</HI> and yesterday came hither. I
fear my Business cannot be ended before the Begin∣ning of next Week, as it
is Assize-Time, and my Brother is but in an indifferent State of Health. I
have wrote thus far, and find my Pen can scrawl nothing but what is as
insipid as myself. Lord WILLOUGHBY DE BROOKE is dead. The Distemper is
amongst the Cattle here. Lord BROOKE is at <HI>War∣wick,</HI> and has locked
up the Castle Gardens.</P>
<P>I have not been at <HI>Coventry</HI> yet; neither do I intend to
enter often into a Place so dia∣metrically opposite to those sylvan
Scenes I <PB N="140" REF="158"/> was entertained with at the
<HI>Leasowes.</HI> Oh! when shall I sit down and end my Days on such a
Spot somewhere near you? The mo∣ney-getting Slaves all think me mad to
spend my Life in Idleness, and wonder I have passed another Year
without setting up in my Busi∣ness. Sordid wretches! whose only God is
Gold. How despicable must Life appear, when it has past away only in
collecting a Heap of shining Cinders! My Resolutions are more strongly
attached than ever to retire. When I come over, I purpose to talk with Mr.
SHAW about <HI>Palmer's-Hill,</HI> which, if not much out of the Way, I will
purchase. I should be glad, when you meet any of the Work∣men, you would
ask, now and then, how they go on at <HI>Northfield.</HI> I hope yourself
and all Friends are well, to whom my best Devoirs, from</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Your affectionate Friend and humble Servant, J. S.
H—N.</SIGNED> <POSTSCRIPT>

<P>P. S. I fear Lady LUXBOROUGH, and all your fine Company, will
visit you before I come back. Pray let me hear from you, if convenient. I
have wrote to Lord DUDLEY, of whom I begged the Favour to send you this.

<HEAD>LETTER XXXVIII. The Duchess of SOMERSET to Lady
LUXBO∣ROUGH.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Percy-Lodge,</HI> 
<DATE><HI>Sept.</HI> 9, 1750.</DATE></DATELINE> 
<SALUTE>Dear Madam,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM extremely sorry for the Accident which prevented my having
the Pleasure of hear∣ing from you, and sincerely hope you have overcome all
the ill Effects of it. You are very obliging in the Concern you express, for
the Scenes of Sorrow I have passed through. I have, indeed, suffered
deeply; but when I <PB N="142" REF="160"/> consider it is the Will of God, who
never cha∣stises his poor Creatures but for their Good, and reflect, at the
same Time, how unwor∣thy I was of these Blessings, which I now la∣ment
the Loss of, I lay my Hand upon my Mouth and dare not repine; but I hope can
with Truth appeal to him in the following Words: 
<Q>Questo affano ei su che non si oppone al suo santo
voler: Chio gemo e gli affro tutti il ge∣miti miei Chio Rango &amp; in tanto
Benedico il suo Nome in Mezzo al Pianto.</Q></P>
<P>You are so good, as to wish my Solitude may afford me some
Amusement; and as I think it a Duty, while it pleases God to con∣tinue us
here, not to let ourselves sink into a stupid and unthankful Melancholy,
I endea∣vour to find out such Entertainments, as my Retirement, and my dear
Lord's unmerited Bounty will admit of. I have built a Por∣ter's Lodge at my
Gate, and am now turn∣ing the long Drawing-Room into a Chapel, which will be
finished in the Gothic Taste, and have three fine painted Windows; these
I <PB N="143" REF="161"/> had bespoke for <HI>Northumberland-House,</HI> but
as its present Owners do not intend that their Chapel shall be in the
same Place that we had proposed, they would not have fitted there. The Room
where you were so good as to break∣fast with us, and my Lord's Bed-chamber,
I could not bear to go into since my <HI>irrepara∣ble</HI> Misfortune, and
therefore, with Lord NOR∣THUMBERLAND's Advice, have laid them to∣gether, which
will make a Room of 35 by 21. I shall put up a very pretty Chimney-Piece in
it with Paper, on which I shall hang my best Pictures.</P>
<P>The Season for some little Alterations with∣out Doors is now
coming on, and I intend some Change in my Rosary, and Openings in other
Parts of the Park. I have also erected a little Hermitage in one of the Woods
near the Canal, whose Roof is thatched, and its Walls of Straw. I read as
usual, and have lately been much pleased with the new Edi∣tion of SULLY's
<HI>Memoirs.</HI> Besides this, my own Servant and myself have worked five
cross-stitch Chairs, and intend three more for my Chapel; they are a Gothic
Mosaic, in fine Crimson, and are to have Gothic Frames. 
<PB N="144" REF="162"/> Thus, dear Madam, I have given you an Account of my
Schemes and Occupations. My Company, at present, consists of Dr. LE
COURAYET, Mr. COWSLAD, and my Chaplain, who is a modest, sensible and
truly pious young Man. The Gentleman who travelled with poor Lord BEAUCHAMP has
been with me two Months, but left me yesterday. What is come to Lord
LUXBOROUGH, or rather to his Son? And why is poor Mrs. WYMONDESOLD to be
treated as an Alien? I conclude she did not marry without her Father's
Consent.</P>
<P>I hear an extreme good Character of your Nephew, Lord ST. JOHN,
which I am sure will give you Pleasure. I must do Lord EGRE∣MONT the
Justice to tell you, that it is impos∣sible for any one to behave in a
more kind and handsome Manner, than he has done ever since my dreadful
Loss; but Mrs. O—N has never taken the least Notice of me. Lord and
Lady NORTHUMBERLAND are at present in the Country, and very well. I am so
near the End of my Paper, that I must only add the Assurance of being,
dear Madam,</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>The <HI>Leasowes,</HI> 
<DATE><HI>Jan.</HI> 1753.</DATE></DATELINE> 
<SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Letter with which you favoured me deserves my earliest
Acknowledgments, and will prove not a little serviceable, in re∣gard to the
Subscription we have in Hand. The whole Account of that Affair is as
fol∣lows: I had been assured by Persons of Ve∣racity, (amongst which I
may safely name Lord DUDLEY, Mr. PIXELL, and THO. COT∣TEREL) that you had
generously made an Of∣fer of twenty Guineas towards the Addition of two new
Bells to our present Set; and that in Case the Parish would supply what
was wanting, it would be a Pleasure to you, Sir, to have your Offer accepted.
Upon this Encouragement, I determined to make Trial what a Subscription would
produce, and ac∣cordingly drew up a Form for that Purpose; intending to write
you an Account of the <PB N="146" REF="164"/> Undertaking, so soon as I
could form a Con∣jecture of its Success. This I was upon the Point of doing,
when I had the Pleasure of a Letter from you, which, nevertheless, was
extremely seasonable, as it immediately removed a Doubt that began to
spread, in Regard to your Concurrence.</P>
<P>There is now subscribed, (exclusive of your Benefaction) the
Sum of fifty Guineas; and I make no Scruple of raising twenty more, by an
Application to such Persons as have not yet been solicited. Be our
Progress what it will, I purpose in a few Weeks to give you a farther
Account of it; in the mean Time, can assure you, that the Subscription
will be pushed forward with all possible Diligence, that it may give us
the earlier Chance for the Pleasure of your Company. I have only to add, that
the Bells will never sound more agreeably, than when they ring for your
Arrival; will be heard no where more advantageously than from some Parts of
my Farm, and that you will find no one more desirous of making the Coun∣try
agreeable to you than</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>March</HI> 20, 1753.</DATE></DATELINE> 
<SALUTE>My dear Friend,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR two last Epistles, of the 4th and 9th Instant, merit
greater Acknowledg∣ments than the trifling Return of mine. I am going upon an
Expedition in a few Hours, yet must not neglect assuring you, how
great∣ly I think myself indebted to your Care and Informations relative to my
Tenants, and beg, if they apply to you again, to tell them, I have lately had a
Letter from Mr. I—, who has promised me to be down at Lady-Day, and
settle Affairs with them all. The Brickman's Bill is much higher than I
thought it would have been. Believe me, between Law∣yers and Builders I am
almost wearied out of my Life, and sincerely wish myself disengaged
from them, especially the former; I hope they may be the last Set of People
applied to by you or me.</P>
<P><PB N="148" REF="166"/>The Malady you complain of at present is
not, I conjecture, so much owing to the Winter, as to Solitude; Cold braces
and Heat relaxes. Could you have in Winter the same Round of Company and
enchanting Scenes that you enjoy in Summer, your Nerves would, I am con∣vinced,
be stronger, and your Spirits more alert. Your Friends (more particularly
myself) ought to think ourselves much obliged to you for that small
Palliative you administer to your languid Hours, in thinking of, or writing
to us. I could cure you much better by a Prescrip∣tion out of Madame DE
MAINTENON's <HI>Letters,</HI> or our Friend HORACE, than by any the whole
<HI>Materia Medica</HI> affords; should these fail, SAP∣PHO, that
universal <HI>Panacea,</HI> might prove a Restorative. I think myself
very happy in ha∣ving this Opportunity of conveying to you, (according to
Promise) what she says of you in her Letter to me, which I shall do in
her own Words, <HI>viz.</HI> 
<Q REND="inline">"Pray tell the <HI>Salopian</HI> Bard, that 'tis my
Wish more than Hope, to preserve him as an Admirer; I would cautiously
avoid losing a common PHILAN∣DER, but a Son of APOLLO is inestimable,"</Q> 
<PB N="149" REF="167"/> and again, 
<Q REND="inline">"The Genii could not please more than VIRGIL's
Grove does; Miss H—'s Glass <HI>shews</HI> it perfectly."</Q> In
the Postscript; 
<Q REND="inline">"Say something clever to my second Poet, and
persuade him, I should do the same my∣self."</Q> You see how far the
Lady is gone only by my Commendations: she is a comi∣cal Girl, and I wish
you were to see her; she has promised me to visit you, as soon as our
new Road will admit of their Coach, if I will escort her to the
<HI>Leasowes.</HI></P>
<P>I was somewhat surprised at being nomi∣nated for a
Commissioner of our new Road, as my Residence is precarious; my Vote, if
ne∣cessary, will be guided by Merit, and the Di∣rection of my Friends. As
C— has been a Servant to my Father, and recom∣mended by you as
deserving, I will give him my Vote, if in the Country. My Lord DUDLEY has
been applied to by Captain W— for his Father, but declined it, and was
so good to declare to me, he would serve C— before he saw your
Letter.</P>
<P>The —, who <HI>never knew me at Hales,</HI> met me at my
Lord's House, and requested my <PB N="150" REF="168"/> Vote; my Answer
was, I knew so little of the Affair, and my coming down was so un∣certain,
that I could not declare myself in any one's Favour.</P>
<P>Mr. CHEEK I have not lately seen. Mr. OUTING and self set out
this Day for <HI>Pur∣ford's-Green,</HI> to make a Visit to our honest
Friend CHARLES WALKER, where we hope to arrive before this Letter does at
<HI>Lombard-Street.</HI></P>
<P>My Lord, Miss LEA, Mrs. ROCK, and her Daughter, all join in
Compliments and good Wishes to you. They are in tolerable good Health,
excepting now and then catching Cold. I had the Pleasure of the three last
to Break∣fast with me yesterday Morning.</P>
<P>Mr. O— has often been solicited by me to write to you, which
he sincerely says he intends when we return to <HI>London</HI> next Week,
and with his Compliments, hopes you will forgive the seeming Neglect he has
been guilty of. His going to sleep at the <HI>Leasowes,</HI> and my
accompanying him therein, has been often <PB N="151" REF="169"/> Matter of
Discourse between us. He declares, he will soon write a Panegyric upon
Sleep, and the Benefit arising from the unrestrained Occupation of one's
own Bed.</P>
<P>I can furnish you with few Particulars con∣cerning Mrs. W—'s
Amour. All I know is, her Husband and other People had ocular Demonstration
of her Guilt, by a Servant Boy's boring three Holes in the Wainscot, which
were afterwards cut in one. I am myself sorry to see a Person
possessed of amiable and noble Qualities, so much sunk by one fatal
Error; and much greater is her Fall, when the <HI>less</HI> malicious Part of
the World condemn her, and declare her Foible of no late Com∣mencement. Mr.
O— tells me, Mr. K— (though I should little have thought it)
wears a <HI>triste</HI> Visage on this Occasion, and whimpers that he is
much concerned.</P>
<P>Your Glass is done, and I have got the gold Clasp back from the
Chaser's. Do let me procure you something, if it is but in Silver, which
perhaps you may like as well, and be Money in Pocket.</P>
<P><PB N="152" REF="170"/>DODSLEY's Man told me, Mr. GRAY's Poems would
come out in about three Weeks. The <HI>Earl of Essex</HI> is a fine
Tragedy; I have seen it, and the <HI>Rival Brothers,</HI> but do not like the
Plot of the last. I am now reading the <HI>Memoirs of Sir Charles

be∣lieve I shall like them full as well as those you designed for the
Colonel, because more friendly than panegyrical.</P>
<P><PB N="153" REF="171"/>I wish (to the Lord! as O— says) I
had the Spirit of Versification, and I would exert it most
superabundantly against two or three of my witty Enemies, and believe I
shall one Day endeavour to finish my <HI>Birming∣ham</HI> Verses, to
revenge myself on some <HI>Folk</HI> in and near this Town, for smiling
in my Face, and cutting my Throat at the same Time with a Feather. Mrs.
R— is quite sick of their Folly and Hypocrisy, and I believe no∣body
will ever lament the Loss of their Ac∣quaintance.</P>
<P>Miss L— is, I think, more improved since she came to
Town than before; and I am glad to see her address People with a little
more Vi∣vacity than she used to do. My Lord has presented her with a fine
new flowered silk Sack, laced Linen, and a Pair of Diamond Ear-Rings, &amp;c.
&amp;c. We were all, last Night, at the Concert in <HI>Dean-Street,
Soho,</HI> and wish your Company had added to our Pleasure.</P>
<P>Upon reconnoitering my Epistle, I imagine it appears a mere
<HI>Farrago Litterarum,</HI> or more properly like a <HI>Welsh</HI> Dish,
called a <HI>Salma∣gundy,</HI> <PB N="154" REF="172"/> which hungry People may
eat, but not well digest, and wish you may have any Re∣lish for this of
mine.</P>

Letters ridiculous and rude; may they ever think so! I am now at my
Conclusion of the fourth Page, and will so far avoid an Apology for it,
that I assure you, it is only Want of more Time, that makes me conclude
this, with the Request of as speedy, and as long an Answer, which will

will send another I bespoke for myself, as soon as it arrives.</P>
<P>The Memoirs of Lord BOLINGBROKE's Life abound too much with
Politicks for <HI>me.</HI> I be∣lieve the <HI>World</HI> also would be as
well pleased with the more private Anecdotes of so great a Man. Herein your
Ladyship would shine; and I could wish you to engage in something of
this Kind, though ever so short; if not for the Public, at least as an
Amusement to your∣self and Friends, and a Legacy to the pre∣sent Lord
BOLINGBROKE, or whom else you should prefer.</P>
<P>Now I have begun to mention Books, let me finish the Subject. The
<HI>Gamester</HI> I have read no more of, than what I gleaned from the
Quotations in the Magazines. I never yet had any Opinion of the Genius of Mr.
MOORE, and I hardly think I shall alter my Sentiments, on Account of this
Performance. The <HI>Moral,</HI> however, must be allowed to be extremely
seasonable.</P>
<P><PB N="157" REF="175"/>The <HI>Earl of Essex</HI> I have read;
the <HI>unfortunate</HI> Earl of ESSEX! whose Story, whatever it may
deserve, has never yet produced a good Line, and now hardly ever will, yet I
am willing, with your Ladyship, to make all Allowances for the Writer.</P>
<P>The <HI>Brothers,</HI> which I have also read, is a noble Tragedy,
full of refined and elevated Sentiments, and, generally speaking, of
suita∣ble Expressions. I am not blind to many of its Faults—but I
have read nothing of late Years that has <HI>affected</HI> me more.</P>
<P>Shall I beg the Favour some Time of bor∣rowing "<HI>Manners,</HI>"
the Book you mention to have read.</P>
<P>I don't remember to have heard you men∣tion any Thing about
VOLTAIRE's last Play. I therefore send it—and thus ends all I have to
say upon the Article of Books.</P>
<P>I am truly glad to hear that you had Mrs. DAVIES so long at
<HI>Barrels,</HI> to counterwork the Effects of this unjoyous Season. For my 
<PB N="158" REF="176"/> own Part, had my Health permitted, I could gladly have
borne a Part there; but I have been little better in bodily Health than I have
been in Mind; and <HI>Home,</HI> when one is not truly well, has more
Attractions than Elysium. Pardon this unpolite Assertion, which seems
to partake of Selfishness: and yet it is <HI>as</HI> un∣polite at least,
to offer one's Company to ano∣ther, when one is not pleased with it
one's-self. I deny that Penances can be done at <HI>Barrels.</HI> At the
<HI>Leasowes,</HI> I have had many a Winter's Experience they may; and what
adds to their Severity is, that they are no way meritorious.</P>
<P>The Jack was sent to COTTEREL to be copied in Mahogany long ago.
'Tis possible, your Servant may find it ready to take Home.</P>
<P>I was two or three Times in company with Captain SOMERVILLE, when he
went to <HI>West∣minster-School.</HI> I would send my Compliments, and an
Invitation, if there was probability enough of his remembering me, to render it
proper: though his Good-nature alone could induce him to visit me now, when
there is <PB N="159" REF="177"/> not a Grain of Amusement to be expected
either from my Place or myself.</P>
<P>I hear now and then of Mr. O—, by Means of my <HI>good
Friend</HI> Mr. H—. They were both going last Week to CHARLES WAL∣KER's
<HI>Villa</HI>; not his Cabbage-Garden <HI>orné,</HI> as Mr. GRAVES
calls his Place at <HI>Claverton,</HI> and for which I rebuke him, for fear the
Bur∣lesque should spread. The last I heard of O— was, that he
blamed Mr. H— for not travelling like an Apostle, as <HI>he</HI> did,
with one Coat, one Shirt, one Pair of Stockings, one Wig, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>I have promoted and accomplished the Ad∣dition of two new Bells to
our present Set; towards which, however, I give but two Gui∣neas.</P>
<P>I drew up a Specimen, or foul Copy of a Petition to Sir GEORGE,
about the Turn∣pike, and so the People of our Parish have both signed and
sent the <HI>Echantillon.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="178"/>Pardon me, if I leave half your Letter

<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Whitchurch,</HI> 
<DATE><HI>May</HI> 14, 1753.</DATE></DATELINE> 
<SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>NOthing but ill Health could have hindred me from writing to you,
and acknow∣ledging the most agreeable Favour of your Letter. I have been
confined ever since <HI>Christ∣mas</HI> with that odious Distemper the
Gout. The very Name of it is abominable. What leng∣thened my Confinement was,
that as soon as I was almost well, I fell down Stairs, hurt the 
<PB N="161" REF="179"/> Part, and was again laid up; but you'll say, I might
have wrote for all this. Indeed I could not. For one of the malicious Imps of
the old Demon got into the Fore-finger of my right Hand at the same Time. I
can shew the Mark now—Besides, my Mother's Health has been so bad,
as quite to dispirit me, and continues to be so; else I assure you, I
should think of seeing the <HI>Leasowes</HI> this Summer. But I can't do
it, as Things are, upon any Ac∣count, nor should I ever forgive myself,
should she die in my Absence. All these Reasons have likewise
hindered my Journey to <HI>London</HI> this Year. Mr. PEARETH too, has been
exceeding ill; so that I may look upon this Year, as unfortunate both to
myself and Friends. I hope, however, you have not felt the Influence of this
evil Star. That Health and Happiness may attend you, is the Interest of all
that know you; mine I am sure in particular; and I can add, that I am
thoroughly sensible of it.</P>
<P>I am an Architect at present. Since I have been able to hop about,
I have amused my∣self that Way. I have been altering the Dis∣position 
<PB N="162" REF="180"/> of my Rooms, and have made them more commodious as I
think: but I will not prejudice your Judgment before-hand. I have, like you,
been at some Expence this Way. But there are two Imperfections I have to
struggle with at <HI>Whitchurch,</HI> which never appeared at the
<HI>Leasowes</HI>; an indifferent Situation, and but a second-hand Head for
Architecture. I long to see your Improvements, from those I have seen
already. Lady LUXBOROUGH has cele∣brated you as a Designer very justly and
very elegantly.</P>
<P>I have got the Verses, and wonder you did not communicate them to
me, for they please me on two Accounts, yours and Lady LUX∣BOROUGH's. I dare
say it would have given me double Pleasure, to have received a Letter from
you by the Hand you proposed. I am much obliged to you for your kind
Inten∣tion, and think myself unhappy I was not in <HI>London</HI> on that
Account. Now, though I cannot ask the Favour with any Propriety, yet, give me
Leave to say, how glad I should be to see you at <HI>Whitchurch</HI> this
Summer; and whenever I have that Pleasure, I beg you <PB N="163" REF="181"/>
will let me know before-hand, for fear of Ac∣cidents. As for my Part, I
resolve to wait on you at the <HI>Leasowes,</HI> as soon as ever it is in
my Power to do it.</P>
<P>I have one Piece of News to tell you, which most likely you have
heard by Mr. GRAVES, which is, that my Brother and Mrs. H—S are married.
I think they are very likely to be happy. I had rather have a Relation than a
Friend married, for the last is always en∣tirely lost. You have the
Compliments of all this Place. But my own I shall always sepa∣rate from the
Vulgar, when addressed to dear Mr. SHENSTONE, from</P>

WHISTLER.</SIGNED></CLOSER>

<HEAD>LETTER XLIII. The Duchess of SOMERSET to Lady
LUXBO∣ROUGH.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Percy-Lodge,</HI> 
<DATE><HI>Dec.</HI> 31, 1751.</DATE></DATELINE> 
<SALUTE>Dear Madam,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>APologies between Friends appear so un∣necessary, that if you
have still the same Inclination which you have formerly shewn to look
upon me in that Light, you will never again treat me with the Ceremony of a
for∣mal Acquaintance; when you write to me, you give me Pleasure; when you do
not, I love my own Peace two well to fancy you are angry with me, while I am
not conscious of my deserving to have you so. You see I do not regulate
my Correspondence as poor Lady — did her Visits; which she never
was to return sooner than her former ones had been repaid.</P>
<P>I am not in the least surprised that you were pleased to
return to the venerable Seat of your <PB N="165" REF="183"/> Ancestors, and
the Abode of your first and happiest Days, and find nothing trivial or
chil∣dish in the Satisfaction you felt, in seeing old Faces full of
Gratitude for Obligations long since past, and by you, perhaps, forgot; or
in recalling some little lively Incidents in the earliest and innocent
Hours of Youth. As for the Wise and Witty of the present Age, I know not
what they would say, and I do not design to hear it; they will scarce
visit my Hermi∣tage, and I shall not leave it to visit <HI>them.</HI> I
hope to dispose of my House in <HI>Downing-Street,</HI> which I would not
do, if I ever in∣tended to pass six Weeks in <HI>London,</HI> for I am fond
of the Situation. But I find myself hap∣piest in the Retreat which my dear
Lord's un∣merited Beneficence has made me Mistress of, and fixed my Home
upon the Spot of Earth I would have chose for myself. Every Thing both
within and without the House reminds me of my Obligations to him; and I
cannot turn my Eyes upon any Object, which is not an Object of his Goodness
to me. The Satisfac∣tion I take in adding either Beauty or Con∣venience to my
Habitation, is greatly enhanced by the Reflection, that while I am adorning 
<PB N="166" REF="184"/> it, I at the same Time can shew my Value for the
Gift, and my Gratitude to the lamented Giver.</P>
<P>I have a regular, and, I hope, a religious Family. My Woman, though
she has not lived with me quite three Years, had before lived twenty-three
betwixt Lord GRANTHAM's and Lady COWPER's; my House-keeper has been a Servant
as long; the Person who takes in my Accounts, pays the Bills, and overlooks
the Men within Doors, has been in the Fami∣ly nineteen Years; and the other,
who has lived ten, has the Care of the Stables, and every Thing without. I
rise at seven, but do not go down till nine, when the Bell rings, and my
whole Family meet me at Chapel; after Prayers, we go to Breakfast; any Friend
who happens to be there, myself, and my Chap∣lain, have ours in the little
Library: the rest in their respective eating Rooms. About ele∣ven, if the
Weather permits, we go to walk in the Park, or take the Air in the Coach: but
if it be too bad for either, we return to our various Occupations. At three we
dine; sit perhaps near an Hour afterwards; then se∣parate, 
<PB N="167" REF="185"/> till we meet at eight for Prayers; af∣ter which we
adjourn again to the Library, where somebody reads aloud, unless some
Stran∣ger comes who chuses Cards, until Half an Hour past nine, when we
sup, and always part before eleven. This to the fine World would sound a
melancholy monastic Life; and I cannot be supposed to have chosen it
from my Ignorance of the Splendour and Gaiety of a Court, but from a thorough
Experience that they can give no solid Happiness; and I find myself more
calmly pleased in my pre∣sent Way of Living, and more truly contented, than
I ever was in the Bloom and Pomp of my Youth. I am no longer dubious what Point
to pursue. There is but one proper for the Decline of Life, and indeed the
only one worth the Anxiety of a rational Creature at any Age: but how do the
Fire of Youth and Flattery of the World, blind our Eyes, and mislead our
Fancies, after a Thousand imaginary Plea∣sures which are sure to
disappoint us in the End!</P>
<P>I condole with you for the Loss of Mr. PRICE, as a faithful
Servant is always a va∣luable Possession.</P>
<P><PB N="168" REF="186"/>Mr. SHENSTONE does me a great deal of Honour
in inscribing his Ode upon <HI>Rural Elegance</HI> to me. I am persuaded he
is Ma∣ster of the Subject, for I have heard from People who saw his Gardens
not long ago, that they are the most perfect Model of it.</P>
<P>I dare say, Lady NORTHUMBERLAND did not know how near she was to
you, or she would not have passed by, without enquiring after you. The
News-papers will inform you, that her Lord supplies the Place of Lord
WALDGRAVE, in the King's Bed-Chamber. Their Children, I mean the two
youngest, were both here, while they made their <HI>Warwick</HI> and
<HI>Staffordshire</HI> Tour, and also till they came from <HI>Bath.</HI>
The little Boy is called ALGER∣NOON, after his Grand-Papa; and is, though
less handsome, the Counterpart of his poor Uncle, Lord BEAUCHAMP; his
Innocence, his Temper, and his Voice, are just the same, and every Motion
of his Body: judge if I am fond of him.</P>
<P>Books you wish me to name. You have undoubtedly read VOLTAIRE's
<HI>Siecle de Louis,</HI> and <PB N="169" REF="187"/> Madame MAINTENON's
<HI>Letters</HI>; I have been entertained with both: he informs the Head;
she, I think, instructs, and may reform the Heart. I often regret that I
had not seen her Writings thirty Years ago. I have seen no∣thing in the
<HI>Genie</HI> of CECILE, except <HI>la lai∣de aimable,</HI> which I think are
pretty. But as for <HI>Jenny Jessamy, Betty Barnes,</HI> and their
Compeers, I never buy any of them, though I have looked over the two last I
have named, in their Passage between Lady NORTHUMBER∣LAND and Mrs. KINGDON.
I hope you will prevail with Mr. SHENSTONE to let me see his <HI>Ode.</HI>
There are some Particulars in Arch∣bishop TILLOTSON's Life, that may
amuse you, and a Dialogue upon Beauty, by Sir HARRY BEAUMONT; these are the
only new Things I have seen. I have hardly Room to subscribe
myself,</P>

<SALUTE>Dear Mr. GRAVES,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AFTER a long Season of Vanity and uni∣versal Dissipation, I
return with <HI>unfeigned</HI> Pleasure to a Correspondence with my
dearest and most familiar Friends. So just is your Notion of the
Permanency of my Affection; and so true it is, that much greater
<HI>Civilities,</HI> than any <HI>yet</HI> shewn me by the Great, can ne∣ver
alter my Opinion of the Valuableness of your Friendship. Will you believe
my simple Assertion, or shall I take Pains to prove it by the very
Nature of Things? I cannot esteem it necessary.</P>
<P>Your Accounts of Mrs. WALKER's Death was new to me. I will write to
Mr. WHISTLER shortly, and am in Hopes, I shall <HI>now</HI> prevail with
him to give me some Weeks of his Com∣pany. Amongst the Strangers who
visited my Walks this Summer, there were three or more, as their Servants
informed us, who had re∣course <PB N="171" REF="189"/> to these
Amusements, on the Death of their Relations. Perhaps the Sight of an old
Friend is no less serviceable on such Occa∣sions.</P>
<P>Your Stream, I find, is very considerable; I dare say HORACE's
was not larger, though mentioned as 
<Q REND="inline">"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Fit to be called a River;
insomuch that neither a <HI>cooler,</HI> nor a purer Stream, surrounded
<HI>Hebrus,</HI> the <HI>Thra∣cian</HI> River.</NOTE><HI>rivo dare nomen

<HI>Notice</HI> taken of it, for I assure you I have heard it commended
here this Summer: I forget by whom. You shew excessive Delicacy in your
Dislike of its running over Water-Cresses as Pot-Herbs. Pray what can at
once have more Beauty and more Pro∣priety, supposing your Stream to pass
through the Kitchen-Garden? But I will not quarrel with you about the
<HI>Kind</HI> of Aquatick, if you will allow me to think nothing more
pleasing than <HI>Greens beneath transparent Water.</HI></P>
<P>When I can fix upon a Painter, to draw me an Head of Lord DUDLEY,
(for which he promises <PB N="172" REF="190"/> to sit at the
<HI>Leasowes)</HI> I will endeavour to get your Picture altered; though
BOND,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. BOND, a Painter in <HI>Birmingham,</HI> an

moreover to send it in the Dress it wore at <HI>Hagley</HI> Table. I would

grievously irksome to tran∣scribe it at this Time. The <HI>antiquary</HI>

<P>DODSLEY adds this Winter a fourth Vo∣lume to his Miscellanies. He
wrote to me last Week, to beg a few Copies of Verses; I shall send him
the Autumn Verses, and two Copies that are upon my Seats,

<SALUTE>Dear Mr. H—N,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THIS can prove no other than an heavy, stupid Letter, agreeable to
the present Disposition of my Mind. The most it can pretend, is to
acquaint you, in vulgar Terms, that you retain your usual Place in my
Af∣fection and Esteem; yet this may be no tri∣vial Information, now you have
accepted a Place at Court, and have left your Friends at Liberty to form
Conjectures about your future Conduct; to continue, or to dismiss you, as
our Electors do their Representatives. Be this as it will, I confess that I
rechuse you, and wish that every Court in <HI>Europe</HI> consisted of
as honest Men.</P>
<P>You are in the right to decline taking M—s, if you find the
Scheme too expensive; and as <PB N="175" REF="193"/> he could not have come
into your Service, without purchasing his Time out from his Master, I
believe it will now be his Point to continue with him till the Expiration of
his Indentures.</P>
<P>I am now in some Sort of Doubt, con∣cerning the Management of my
Snuff-Box; whether to have it repaired in the cheapest Way, with a figured
Tortoise-Shell on the Top, and a plain Tortoise-Shell in the Bot∣tom; or to
exchange the Gold of it, and have a figured Tortoise-Shell Box with a gold
Rim, <HI>like yours with a gilt one,</HI> only in the Shape of an oblong
Square, a little rounded at the Corners. I should have no Thoughts of this,
but that my own seems too little and unmanly. Give me your Opinion soon;
though, if this latter Scheme includes much Expence, pro∣ceed with the former,
if you please, imme∣diately.</P>
<P>I desire my gold Clasp and Rim may be directly exchanged; I
shall have a new gold Clasp and Rim: perhaps, may enclose a Pat∣tern for
the former, before I seal this Letter. <PB N="176" REF="194"/>
<HI>Quaere,</HI> therefore, whether the Man, who makes it, will now allow
most in the Exchange.</P>
<P>I believe I shall defer the Purchase of my favourite Waistcoat
till the Spring. My Vi∣sitants begin to fail me, (though Sir GEORGE
LYTTELTON, the Dean, and Mr. LYTTELTON, were here yesterday) my Verdure
abandons me, and I have little else to do, than go to sleep for the
Winter.</P>
<P>Pray send me the Verses on Miss B—R, by the honourable
Personage. As to mine, you may give Copies, if you please; but as they are
not fully corrected, I hope whoever has those Copies, will take care they be
not printed. I can say nothing polite at present, so must defer my
Acknowledgments to the Ladies at <HI>Woolston,</HI> till I write to you
again.</P>
<P>Your Letter to Lady LUXBOROUGH was promised, so I think you
should by all Means write, though I confess it appears to have been rather
too long deferred.</P>
<P><PB N="177" REF="195"/>And now having spoke to the principal Parts
of your Letter, let me consider what I have to add.</P>
<P>First then, your Tenant, old Mr. P—s, of the Hill-Top, was
carried in a Hearse, through my Grounds, to be buried yesterday. Mr.
I— has been two or three Days in this Country adjusting Matters with
your Tenants. —.</P>
<P>C—Y tells me, you may have your Place sup∣plied at the
Expence of five Pounds <HI>per</HI> Year. If so, is it not your Point to come
down and live at <HI>Lappal?</HI> I do not herein speak merely for my own
Sake. Sir GEORGE told me yesterday, that he had secured me BLOOMER'S
Cottage. I said, I was obliged to him, but did not ask, after what Manner.
He promised to come and dine, and stay a Night with me next Year. In the
mean Time, I am beguiled of his dining with me, by <HI>your</HI> venerable
D—; for having had an Offer from him, from Mr. <PB N="178" REF="196"/>
LYTTELTON and the Dean, to take a Dinner here this Week, the D—, through
his great Address, conveyed all these Honours to the <HI>Grange</HI>; and
to-morrow, it seems, Sir GEORGE dines with Master PEARSALL. I
remonstrated upon this to Mr. LYTTELTON, at the <HI>Grange,</HI> in a Manner
pretty forcible, and yet tolera∣bly decent. He excused for himself and them
in a Manner that made me quite satisfied with <HI>him.</HI> He is an
excellent young Man.</P>
<P>Let these Things serve as Lessons to you, who are a
Courtier, not to hope from Am∣bition to receive the

<SALUTE>Madam,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I FIND myself at length enabled to obey your Grace's Commands,
after a Delay, but ill expressive of the Pleasure with which I received
them. But by some Means or other, the Original of this Ode was mislaid, and
it was not immediately in my Power, from scat∣tered Materials, to give it
once more the Form, in which it now appears.</P>
<P>I fear it is no less requisite to make an Apology for the
Freedom of inscribing it to your Grace from the Beginning. In this
Re∣spect, I have but little to offer, beside the flattering Imagination,
that the <HI>Subject</HI> might recommend it. It would be no small Vanity in
me to presume, that in Regard to the more elegant Amusements of a Country
Life, I had <PB N="180" REF="198"/> the Honour to entertain the same
Sentiments with your Grace; however, something of this Kind I must of
Necessity confess, if I would give a genuine Account of the Liberty I
have taken.</P>
<P>The additional Fragment was originally in∣tended as an Episode to
a much larger Poem on the Subject. It was thrown into its pre∣sent Form
soon after the Rebellion, and it is now transcribed, because I would not
send a vacant Space in my Paper, wherein I had the most distant Chance of
contributing to your Grace's Amusement.</P>
<P>Lady LUXBOROUGH, who does me the Ho∣nour of communicating these
trifling Produc∣tions to your Grace, will not fail to do me the
<HI>Justice</HI> of declaring the singular Veneration I have for your
Grace's Character. She will testify, with how much Diffidence I offer you
such imperfect Compositions, written at a Dis∣tance from every judicious
Friend, with too much Inaccuracy, by the Side of Meadows and Streams, from
which little can be ex∣pected, but a Group of rural Allusions. Above 
<PB N="181" REF="199"/> all she will be so obliging as to suggest, how
little I am influenced by any other Ambition, compared with that of being
esteemed,</P>

confess to you, that the Honour you have done me by the Inscription of the
First, and a Stanza or two in the Poem itself, has given me some Pain?
And I shall look upon it as a very great Addition to the Favour, if whenever
my Name, or that of <HI>Piercy-Lodge</HI> occurs, you will have the Good∣ness
to fill the Blank (which leaving out those Words must occasion) with
Stars, Dashes, or any other Mark you please, without suspecting me of
an affected or false Modesty, since to either of these Accusations I
can honestly plead not guilty. The Idea you have formed of my Character, you
have taken from a partial Friend, whose Good-nature may have (and in this
Case certainly has) warped her Judgment. The World in general, since they
can find no Fault in your Poem, will blame the Choice of the Person to whom
it is inscribed, and draw mortifying Comparisons betwixt the ideal Lady and
the real one. But I have a more impartial Judge to produce, than either my
Friend or the World, and that is my own <PB N="183" REF="201"/> Heart, which
though it may flatter me, I am not quite so faulty as the latter would
repre∣sent me, at the same Time loudly admonishes me, that I am still
further from the valuable Person Lady LUXBOROUGH has drawn you in to
suppose me.</P>
<P>I hope you will accept these Reasons as the genuine, and most
serious Sentiments of my Mind, which indeed they are, though accom∣panied
with the most grateful Sense of the Ho∣nour you designed me.</P>
<P>I cannot help mentioning another Copy of Verses of yours, which,
if it is not already printed, I hope you will permit Mr. DOD∣SLEY to add to his
new Collection, and that is <HI>Damon's Bower,</HI> occasioned by the Death
of Mr. THOMSON. If you should have mis∣laid the Original, I have a Copy at
your Ser∣vice, which I will transmit either to you, in Case you should
have a Mind to look it over again, or transmit it directly to Mr.
DODSLEY.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XLVIII. The Duchess of SOMERSET to Lady
LUX∣BOROUGH.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Piercy-Lodge,</HI> 
<DATE><HI>Nov.</HI> 23, 1753.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I DID indeed, dear Madam, begin to de∣spair of having the Honour,
and (what I felt more sensibly) the Pleasure of hearing from you again. I
am so subject to fall into Errors, that I was afraid some unguarded
Expression in my last Letter might have given you Of∣fence, and yet my
Heart bore witness, how far I had been from intending it.</P>
<P>I have been extremely ill the whole Sum∣mer, and for some Weeks
believed in great Danger; but, by the Blessing of God upon Dr. SHAW's
Prescriptions, I am at present, though lean and ill-favoured, much better;
yet still obliged to be carried up and down Stairs, for Want of Strength and
Breath to carry my∣self: but I have great Reason to bless God 
<PB N="185" REF="203"/> for the Ease I now enjoy. When one comes to the last
broken Arches of MIRZA's Bridge, Rest from Pain must bound our Ambition,
for Pleasure is not to be expected in this World; where I have no more a
Notion of laying Schemes to be executed six Months, than I have six Years
hence; which, I believe, helps to keep my Spirits in an even State of
Chear∣fulness to enjoy the Satisfactions which pre∣sent themselves,
without anxious Solicitude about their Duration. We have lived to an Age that
necessarily shews us the Earth crum∣bling under our Feet, and as our
Journey seems approaching towards the Verge of Life, is it not more natural
to cast our Eyes to the Prospect beyond it, than by a retrospective View,
to recall the troublesome Trifles that ever made our Road difficult or
dangerous? Methinks it would be imitating LOT's Wife, (whose His∣tory is
not recorded as an Example for us to follow) to want to look back to the
mi∣serable Scene we are so near escaping <HI>from.</HI></P>
<P>I have spent the last three Weeks most agree∣ably. The first
of them, the Bishop of <HI>Ox∣ford</HI> and Mr. TALBOT, passed with us,
and <PB N="186" REF="204"/> had the Goodness to leave Miss TALBOT (whose
Character I think you must have heard) when they went away. She is
<HI>all</HI> the World has said of her, as to an uncommon Share of
Un∣derstanding: but she has other Charms, which I imagine you will join
with me in giving the Preference even to that; a mild and equal Temper, an
unaffected pious Heart, and the most universal Good-will to her
Fellow-Crea∣tures, that I ever knew. She censures Nobody, she despises
Nobody, and whilst her own Life is a Pattern of Goodness, she does not
ex∣claim with Bitterness against Vice. We spent a good deal of our Time
in our own Rooms, except in the Mornings, but our Time is a good deal broken in
upon. Soon after nine we meet in the Chapel; as soon as Prayers are over, we
go to Breakfast, and after that we work, during which, Mr. COWSLAD, or my
Chaplain, read aloud; at eleven we go, if the Weather is tolerable, to take the
Air for two Hours at least, which Dr. SHAW insists upon my doing. The
Moment we get out of the Coach, we see no more of one another till three,
when the Dinner is punctually upon the Table. Dinner and Tea are both over 
<PB N="187" REF="205"/> by five, when we retire till eight, and then go to
Prayers; after which we adjourn into the little Library, where we work, and the
Gen∣tlemen read, as in the Morning, till Supper, a Quarter before ten, and it
is a Rule to be all in our Rooms a Quarter before eleven.</P>
<P>We are at present very highly entertained with the <HI>History
of Sir Charles Grandison,</HI> which is so vastly above <HI>Pamela</HI>
or <HI>Clarissa,</HI> that I shall not be easy till you have read it,
and sent me your Sentiments upon it. Miss TAL∣BOT received Lady GRAY's
[<HI>Somewhat omitted, perhaps some Remarks on Grandison</HI>] in a Let∣ter
of six Sides, wrote with the greatest good Sense and Vivacity imaginable.
I fancy she is an excellent and agreeable young Woman.</P>
<P>It is now more than Time to return you Thanks for the Trouble you
have taken in conveying Mr. SHENSTONE's admirable Poem<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Rural Elegance,</HI> inscribed to the Writer of this
Letter.</NOTE> to me. I have wrote to him this Post, and could not do it
sooner, because his Letter was only dated <HI>Leasowes,</HI> and I could
not find out his Post-Town, without sending to Mrs. STANLEY, whom I do not
visit, and who <PB N="188" REF="206"/> lives twelve Miles from me. I have
expressed my Gratitude in the best Manner I am able; but am under the
Necssity of declining the Honour he intended me, and have begged him to
fill up the Blanks with Stars, or what he pleases, whenever my Name, or that
of <HI>Pier∣cy-Lodge</HI> was designed, and I hope he will oblige me.</P>
<P>You say, you have been in a Lethargy. Dear Madam, this must have
proceeded from some Oppression upon your Spirits, for which I have known
Tar-Water to be a sovereign Remedy, and wish you would try it. Poor Mrs.
W—D! but since we can say nothing to her Honour, let us not expatiate
upon her Disgrace.</P>
<P>Any Thing directed to be left with WIL∣LIAM PHILLIPS, my Porter, in
<HI>Downing-Street,</HI> will be sent to me directly.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XLIX. W. SHENSTONE, Esq. to Mr. IAGO.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>The <HI>Leasowes,</HI> 
<DATE><HI>Jan.</HI> 29, 1754.</DATE></DATELINE> 
<SALUTE>Dear Mr. IAGO,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM at a Loss how to begin this Letter. I will not, however, in
the usual Way, give you a tedious List of Apologies in the Front of it.
Some Account of my Silence you will find dispersed throughout the Letter,
and as for what is deficient, I will depend up∣on your Friendship.</P>
<P>There has not been a Person here since you left me, of whom I
could obtain the least Intelligence concerning you; and as an Enquiry by the
Post was my only obvious Method, and as I both owed and promised you a
Letter at Parting, I do acknowledge my∣self to blame, notwithstanding all
the Excuses I can make.</P>
<P><PB N="190" REF="208"/>Amidst all that Conflux of Visitants whom
I received this last Season, I was hardly once <HI>so</HI> happy as I was
in <HI>your</HI> Company: I was the happier in seeing you so, and if you
re∣member, I took Notice at the Time, how little your Vivacity was impaired, in
compa∣rison of mine. If I was then but a sorry Companion, it was not
Solitude and Winter that could make me a better <HI>Correspondent.</HI> That
Gaiety and Humour, which you was once so partial as to discover in my
Letters, will hardly appear again there, even to the Eyes of my most partial
Friend; at least, they will not enliven any Letter that I write in Winter.
Yet Friendship still remains; Friend∣ship, like the Root of some
perennial Flower, perhaps even then gathers Strength in Secret, that it may
produce a better Display of its Colours in the Spring.</P>
<P>This I do not pretend to be an adequate Apology. I know, my
dearest Friend, that you both like to see and to hear from me at all Times;
but it proves that you have no <HI>great</HI> Loss, either of my Letters or
my Company.</P>
<P><PB N="191" REF="209"/>I am, as the Phrase is, deeply penetrated by
the Civility of your Neighbour, Mr. MIL∣LER. He took a short Dinner with me
once, dropping Sir GEORGE at Mr. PEARSALL's; he could not have pleased me
better: he after∣wards breakfasted here, and in general seemed fond of
every Opportunity of bringing good Company to my Hole, the <HI>Leasowes.</HI>
Do you think that <HI>Radway</HI> or that <HI>Harbury</HI> have no Attractions
for me? You know me too well to imagine it—But I truly am not well enough
to dare to be from Home. Friends will say, 
<Q REND="inline">"You may be as free at my House as at your
own,"</Q> and they will mean what they say. But what is this to the
Purpose, if you can∣not make yourself so?</P>
<P>I cannot pretend to give you a Detail of what passed since I
saw you. Lord D— with myself made one Visit to <HI>Hewell.</HI> I
will not say, that his Lordship only, for I also was received in the
politest Manner imaginable. We met Mr. and Mrs. WINNINGTON. We took a Trip to
Mr. VERNON's, where we met also Mr. COVENTRY, and a deal of other 
<PB N="192" REF="210"/> Company. All this would afford Subject for
Conversation betwixt you and me, but I must not use so much of my Paper
to this Pur∣pose.</P>
<P>Lord P—'s Piece of Water should have been only a large
Serpentine Stream. I can give you many Reasons. I think him such a Sort of
Character, as may <HI>shine</HI> in Company upon growing older; he is, and
must be beloved already: he has been here once since, and talks of
causing me to come and design for him in his Park. The Plan for the House
is right, supposing it right to continue it. His Park may have many
Beauties. I hope some time to meet <HI>you</HI> there.</P>
<P>My Ode after long Delay has been sent to the Duchess of
SOMERSET. It has produced me two genteel Letters from her Grace, and I am
pleased with the Event, for some Rea∣sons which I could mention.</P>
<P>Soon after this, DODSLEY asked me to con∣tribute to a fourth
Volume of his Miscellanies. I meant at first to do so pretty largely; but
I <PB N="193" REF="211"/> afterwards changed my Mind, and determined to send
only little Pieces. I did send him se∣veral of my own, some of my Friends
WHIST∣LER, and GRAVES, and some accidental Pieces of yours, which lay in my
Drawer. I meant to send something of yours of my own Accord, if I was
hurried, otherwise not without ap∣plying for Consent. He wrote me word,
last Week, that his Publication must be deferred, upon Account of the
Elections, so that we shall now have Time enough to meet or write upon the
Subject. What I purposed was your <HI>Linnets,</HI> 
<Q REND="inline">"I owe, &amp;c."</Q> Dick G—s sent me the
inclosed little comical Fable; I made some few Alterations, and put it into
DODSLEY's Hands. Be so good as to return it, as I have now no other Copy.</P>
<P>Some Correspondence I have had this Win∣ter with Mr. H—N,
about Toys and Trinkets, which he gets done for me in <HI>London.</HI> He is by
far a better Friend and Correspondent than a Poet. Should you take a Trip to
Town, he would be quite <HI>proud</HI> to see you.</P>
<P><PB N="194" REF="212"/>I am like the rest of the World, perusing
<HI>Sir Charles Grandison.</HI> I don't know whether that World joins me in
preferring the Au∣thor's <HI>Clarissa.</HI> He wants the Art of Abridg∣ment
in every Thing he has yet wrote.</P>
<P>My dear Friend, pardon this flegmatic Let∣ter, and cherish and
preserve your own Viva∣city. If Occasion offers, do not neglect to call
upon me, for my own Sake, and believe you have not alive a more lasting, or,
more affectionate Friend, than</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I WOULD sooner have returned you my Thanks for the Favour of your
most truly obliging Letter, but was afraid of being too troublesome, by
engaging so much of your Time, which you know so well how to em∣ploy to
better Purposes.</P>
<P>The kind Offer you made me, of sending me any Thing you
occasionally happened to write, I look upon as the highest Obligation; and
you will greatly add to it, if you will permit me to shew them to a very
ingenious Friend of mine, whose Ingenuity is her least Praise, since
the even Chearfulness of her Temper, the Candour and Integrity of her Heart,
joined with the most unaffected and honourable Piety, must claim the
Esteem of all <PB N="196" REF="214"/> Lovers of Virtue, who have the
Happiness of being acquainted with her. You may possibly have heard of
her, as in her very young Days, some little Things of her writing got abroad,
which were thought worthy of Notice, consi∣dering the Age she was then of.
She is a Grand∣daughter of old Bishop TALBOT's and Niece to the Lord
Chancellor of that Name. She has lately spent six Weeks with me here, and
went away only last <HI>Thursday.</HI></P>
<P>I take the Liberty to send this Letter with∣out a Cover, as I am
conscious that nothing I write is worth double Postage, since its only
Meaning is to express the Regard with which I am,</P>

<HEAD>LETTER LI. Mr. H— to W. SHENSTONE, Esq.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Mr. SHENSTONE,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>FEW People can boast a greater Sensibi∣lity of the Obligations
conferred upon them than myself, and few are, I believe, less able to repay
them: but that I may not ap∣pear quite defective in both, I will endeavour to
send you a long, though not a very ele∣gant Epistle, in return for the many
obliging ones you have favoured me with.</P>
<P>My Spirits, like yours, have a Tendency towards Retirement, and
whatever brings them into violent Action, is sure to destroy them. No
less than ten or twelve Persons in different Parts of the Town, who are
lately arrived from the Country, have I been obliged to at∣tend to one Place or
another, which, with my own Affairs likewise, have often made we wish to
dwell where no one should find me out for <PB N="198" REF="216"/> seven
Years to come. Mr. B—H was one of my Visitors, and brought great
Complaints from SAPPHO, and the Ladies at <HI>W—n,</HI> against me, for
not writing according to Promise; I have wrote her a very penitential Letter
of two Sheets, which I hope will make an At∣tonement, and produce an Answer.
Thus far have I wrote a Week ago, and by many Oc∣currences have been prevented
finishing my Letter till this Day, when I received yours of the twelfth
Current, to which, as well as your former Epistles, I will scrawl forth
some Things by Way of Answer.</P>
<P>I have at last got (after having two returned) a gold Pencil
Case made to my Mind for you, which with the <HI>Aegyptian</HI> Pebble, and
some Im∣pressions of my Seals, I packed up in a Box, and carried them
myself to the <HI>White-Horse,</HI> in <HI>Friday-Street,</HI> last
<HI>Tuesday,</HI> in Order to go by ROWLEY's Waggon, but he was gone be∣fore
I arrived there; which induced me to leave the Box (packed up in blue Paper,
and sealed with my Arms) in the Hands of the Wo∣man of the House, who
promised herself to deliver it to-day to old DANKS, and hope you 
<PB N="199" REF="217"/> will receive it safe some-time next Week. The Pebble
I was obliged to return, for I did not think it was made concave and convex
enough; it is not quite as I would have it, however, it is as well as I can
procure it, and if it pleases you, it will please me of course. I saw a
beautiful Onyx at the Lapidary's, eight Inches long or more, and four broad, it
was to be cut for an Etwee. I have bought a Sheet of China Paper, pink Colour,
bigger than this, for one Shilling and Six-pence, and some few Prints, a new
Pair of fine silver Buckles, &amp;c.</P>
<P>If I could be astonished at any Thing, it would be at the
Perplexity and Delay of the Law; and to compleat my Amazement, my Attorney has
presented me with a Bill of Costs of more than two hundred Pounds.
Positively I will leave <HI>London.</HI> My Scheme is this; to board at
<HI>L—,</HI> and see no Company, except yourself and Lord DUDLEY's
Family, on any Account whatever. Do stand my Friend, and advise me what do
in regard to settling there. I propose to send down my Cabinet, and
some other Boxes, very soon. If you will be so good <PB N="200" REF="218"/> to make JOHN TAYLOR and SAMUEL PARKES set their merry Men to work
for me. I will prepare to depart from <HI>London</HI> the Be∣ginning of next
Month; must call for a few Days at <HI>Gore-Lands,</HI> as being the first
visiting Place in my Rout; next, <HI>Oxford</HI> will detain me a little
while; from thence to <HI>Edge-Hills,</HI> (to see Mr. T—N, who I hear
has got a Living of three hundred Pounds <HI>per Annum</HI> lately fell to
him;) next to <HI>Coventry,</HI> where I must stay a Fortnight, or perhaps
a Month, then to <HI>Birmingham,</HI> and then to the <HI>ne plus ultra</HI> of
my Tours till next Summer, of which I can say nothing certain; however, I
will live <HI>in Spe melioris Aevi,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In Hope of
better Times.</NOTE> and, with sometimes your Company, I shall esteem
myself happier than if I remained here. Pardon me, when I confess, I fear
you will think me altered in many Respects; that I am no very elegible
Companion is most certain: what with the Intricacy of my Affairs, indifferent
Health, (for my Pain in my Breast has troubled me much of late) and some
other Incidents, I am rendered so stupid and confused, that I scarce
can rank myself a Degree above the <PB N="201" REF="219"/> veriest Boor in
the Country; and when I come down, I shall put a quick Stop to all the
in∣tended Visits from all the <HI>Jack-a-Nokes</HI>'s and
<HI>Tom-a-Stiles</HI> of <HI>Hales-Owen,</HI> even though that double-faced
<HI>Janus</HI> you mention were at the Head of them, peeping in at both Doors
at once. I absolutely have laughed very heartily this Afternoon, at your odd
Account of the old Cur, whom I should take great Pleasure to mortify, or
even to mar, for he can never be mended before the D—l has him.</P>
<P>I fear your Anger against me is at this Hour, (past eight at
Night) at a Crisis; another very pestilent Fit will arise, worse than
the former on <HI>Monday,</HI> which I prognosticate will go off at the
same Time, the very Instant you read this Part in my Letter. Am not I
<HI>very</HI> vain, to think you can so <HI>very</HI> easily forgive me; I
fear you will have more Reason to find Fault with me in the Country, when I
shall be so much nearer to you then than I am now. I do not fish for a
Compliment, when I say, I have many dark Spots for a few white ones: but I
flatter myself, you will have the Good∣ness to bear with my Foibles, more
than any <PB N="202" REF="220"/> body else. Be not angry at me for not
en∣closing this to Lord D—Y. I write so of∣ten there, and so
seldom have answers, that I fear his Lordship will think I make too free
with him: I desired a few Franks a while ago, but have heard nothing
concerning them; however, do make my respectful Compliments at the
<HI>Grange,</HI> when you go there. I hear that Miss DOLMAN and Miss
MILLWARD are in <HI>London</HI>; the former I have not seen, and the latter I
am unacquainted with.</P>
<P>I lately contracted some Acquaintance with a Gentleman who is a
great Virtuoso, he is a F. R. S. and has a very fine Collection both of
Medals and Fossils, especially the latter, which he is willing to
increase, at the Ex∣pence of the former. I told him of the <HI>Dud∣ley</HI>
Lime-Pitts; he shewed me some Fossils, like those you gave me from
thence; begs me to procure him all I could lay my Hands upon, and he would
exchange Medals for them. I should be obliged to you, if you meet with any
more, to reserve them till I come down, and in the next to inform me, if you
are like∣ly to procure any for me, as I have promised <PB N="203" REF="221"/>
the Gentleman to visit him again soon: you must not let the
<HI>D—y</HI> Fellow impose upon you, he is ignorant, though impudent.
The Gentleman's Name is B—E, of <HI>Swedish</HI> Pa∣rents: I bought
some silver Coins of him very cheap. I saw the famous Mr. A. POND at his
House in the City, who had a Diamond on his Finger, which I think outshone
the D— of E—'s, who I find is, as a F. R. S. an Acquaintance of
theirs. The D—n is gone to <HI>E—r.</HI></P>
<P>What to say concerning Miss — I know not! All has been
done, and said, and thought of, by all of us that could be. I pity her for
her Mother's, as well as for her own Sake, and should be sorry to have her
Mother think her incapable of going into the World; I do assure you, (under
the Veil of Secrecy) she is too giddy, young and thoughtless, as well as
proud, to know her own Interest, or even, knowing it, to pursue it. A young
Lady will not bear with her; and it would be somewhat difficult to introduce
her to one of middle Age, who would strictly keep her under her Eye, and
improve her by Advice and Instruc∣tion <PB N="204" REF="222"/> more than
Command; for she has at School a great deal of Work to very little Book,
which I am certain makes her, at her leisure Hours, fly to Amusement rather
than Study. Do not mention this to Mrs. R. I will talk to Mrs. B—
concerning her.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Mr. SHENSTONE,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>MY last Letter will reach your Hands this Evening; it will be very
unamu∣sing I dare say, and though I snatch this Mo∣ment to write, I do it
at the Expence of postponing many other affairs; but the me∣lancholy
Occasion demands, nay compels it.</P>
<P>Poor Miss D— expired yesterday Morning at three o'Clock;
Dr. B— and Mr. S— were called up to no Purpose. Miss M—
fell into violent Hysterics, and is now very indifferent. What sad
Catastrophes oftentimes attend the most desirable and innocent
Pleasures! I will say no more of this Matter to you, as I be∣lieve every
Body of her Acquaintance must regret the Loss of her.</P>
<P>I saw Mr. CRAWLEY to-day, who enquired after your Health, &amp;c.
desiring his Compli∣ments <PB N="206" REF="224"/> to you. I am by him
informed, that Miss L— is one of Mr. W—'s Executors, and will
inherit great Part of his Fortune; tho' the Will has a Caveat lodged against
it, which may probably cause some Trouble before she can enjoy what I
hope will render her inde∣pendent of the World. Pray do you know whether Lord
D— is coming to Town or not? I hear he is.</P>
<P>My Cabinet and Boxes did not go last <HI>Sa∣turday</HI> it
seems, but will next—When I shall follow them I know not; my Attorney
tells me, I must stay in Town till my Cause comes on, and is over. I have
taken another Lod∣ging, but shall not go to it till the Middle of next Month;
and even then would have you direct your Letters here as usual. I ne∣ver
shall like another Lodging so well as I do this.</P>
<P>My Brother, who is my principal Witness, is to come up; in
short, I have little Time of Relaxation, either to Body or Mind, and wish I
were once settled in the Country. Your kind Invitation to the
<HI>Leasowes</HI> obliges me much, <PB N="207" REF="225"/> but do not press
me to see Company, whilst I am so much happier <HI>there</HI> without. By
Com∣pany, I mean Visitors whom I am unacquainted withal.</P>
<P>Sir G— L— is to be Treasurer of the Navy, as reported.
People tell me, I should make an Interest for myself in his Favour. How
am I to introduce myself? Believe me, I had rather live at <HI>L—</HI>

<SALUTE>Dear Mr. H—,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Write in the utmost Astonishment and Con∣fusion of
Spirit!—I wonder Mr. C— did not give me some Intimation of Miss
D—'s Ill∣ness before. However, all her Relations will think
themselves lastingly indebted both to him and to all beside who have
contributed their kind Endeavours to further her Recovery. We are under a

Vigilance of Dr. B—, and convinced of the friendly Care of her
Acquaintance that attend her, I shall dread to look into the Letter that I
expect by to-morrow's Post. God grant it may be favourable! I have Hopes

<HEAD>LETTER LIV. Mr. H— to W. SHENSTONE, Esq.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Mr. SHENSTONE,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Really compassionate your Sufferings, both of Body as well as
Mind, the former (the Tooth-ach I mean) may perhaps soon be re∣medied, the
latter, I fear, must be effected by Time, But it is needless, as well as
imper∣tinent, in me to moralize to you upon this, or any other unavoidable
Misfortune, who know how to reconcile the seeming Contradictions in the
Decrees of Providence, and to submit to them in a better Manner than People
of weak∣er Judgments than yourself can. Let me have the Pleasure, my dear
Friend, to find your Spirits unbroken by this Shock, and endeavour to shake
off the Melancholy you are too sub∣ject to indulge, to the Prejudice of your
Health, when Accidents like this, or sometimes less, befal you. I have not
seen Mr. C—, (nor can I till <HI>Thursday)</HI> therefore do not
pretend to send <PB N="211" REF="229"/> you any more Particulars, relating to
the un∣welcome News you have received. I beg, if you would have me think you
well, to let me hear from you immediately.</P>
<P>I am extremely pleased with your Argument upon Enmity and Revenge;
it is my own Way of thinking, yet I often lament, that I am compelled to act
contrary to it, in the Prose∣cution of my Law-Suit against —, the
faithless Guardian of my younger Days and shattered Fortune. <HI>If any Man
will take my Coat, I must give him my Cloak also.</HI> This is very
self-denying Doctrine, and what I scarce think was intended to be literally
accepted. I have been these three Days past attending on my Attorney, about
settling some disagreeable Truths relating to my Cause; and greatly
wronged as I am, I would forgive the Author of my Evils, if he would restore
what he un∣justly detains from me, and banish himself from my Knowledge,
without calling him to Ac∣count for what his Extravagancy has hitherto robbed
me of; this I fear he will not do, and Self-preservation will compel me to
take all Advantages I can.</P>
<P><PB N="212" REF="230"/>I am greatly concerned to think, I shall not
be able to come down before the End of Summer. I will write to Mr. I—, to
see what he can do with A— T—, in order to make him quit, when he
meets him at <HI>Birmingham</HI>; am much obliged to you, for the Trouble you
already have had, and still offer to undertake to serve me.</P>
<P>As I am in great Expectations my Cause will be determined this
Summer, I would defer doing any Thing material at <HI>L—</HI> till it is
over, unless it be putting the Parlour in some Repair when the Tenants
quit, which I shall desire them by Mr. I— to comply with.</P>
<P>More Particulars I will mention in my next, and will write next
Post, notwithstanding Franks, I am told, will not go after to-night. Adieu,
dear Sir, and let your next assure me, of your being as well as I can
wish you, which will be the greater Satisfaction</P>

<HEAD>LETTER LV. Mr. H— to W. SHENSTONE, Esq.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Mr. SHENSTONE,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Should not have let two Posts slip away since I received
your last Letter, dated the 6th Instant, could I have avoided such an
Omission; I will give my Reasons for so doing before I end my
Letter.</P>
<P>When I reflect upon the melancholy Situa∣tion of Mind you labour
under, I think I should not indulge it. It is offering an una∣vailable
Sacrifice to an irremediable Misfortune. I can sympathize with my Friend, and
partake of his Grief, yet it is not, I believe, any Im∣peachment of a
compassionate Temper, to en∣deavour to remove those Ideas from the Mind
(if they impair the Health of the Sufferer) which are too violent for it; even
though the Object were (if possible) more meritorious than the
greatly-lamented Lady who was so <PB N="214" REF="232"/> suddenly hurried
from us: however, while this Catastrophe is so recent, I may venture to
write upon a Subject which I hope Time will draw the Veil over, though not
totally efface; you expect it from me; yet I know few Par∣ticulars that have
not very probably reached your Ears by other Hands. I purposely avoid∣ed
going to Mr. C—'s, by Reason of the great Confusion they were in,
till the Middle of this Week, when I called, and paid the Thanks you desired,
both to that Family and Dr. B—, for their Care and Attendance. Mrs.
C—'s little Girl was sent out of the Way, and is not permitted to come
Home yet; she has been so ill herself, that it was feared she would
have miscarried, but is now better. Miss M—D came into the Room while
I was there, and asked much after you and Mr. D—, whom she was glad
to hear was gone to D—'s. She desired me to remember her Compliments
when I wrote to you, and should be glad to hear how you were in Health. I
thought she looked a little Wild, and was fearful of mentioning any Thing
that might disorder her again; they tell me, she is, in a Manner, quite
well, for when she was at the worst, <HI>Ophelia</HI> in <HI>Ham∣let,</HI> 
<PB N="215" REF="233"/> Mrs. B— said, could not equal her Deli∣rium.</P>
<P>Mrs. B— could scarcely refrain her Tears when she spoke
upon the Subject, and it gave me great Pain to hear her Detail. She told me,
the Doctor left her at half an Hour past ten as well as could be expected. At
three in the Morning, the Nurse went down Stairs; Miss M— dropt
asleep, when Miss S— perceived the poor Lady struggling to spit,
and though every Assistance was imme∣diately at Hand, she expired in
less than five Minutes. The Doctor returned, Mrs. B— said, so
affected, that he did not recover his Spirits for two or three Days afterwards,
and wished often, that he had never known her, though every body is well
satisfied with what he did; Miss M—, in particular, spoke in
Raptures upon the Tenderness of Conduct, and friendly Affability that
appeared through his whole At∣tendance.</P>
<P>I will here put an End to my Narration. I fear I have said too
much, and am almost inclined not to send what I have wrote. My 
<PB N="216" REF="234"/> Motives for not writing sooner appear on the other
Side; only a disagreeable Hurry you will find.</P>
<P>You may, perhaps, remember me to have mentioned a Relation I had in
<HI>Norfolk,</HI> of my Name, who always was seemingly fond of me, and having
no Children, promised to make me his Heir. I was sent for by a Gentleman, a
few days ago, who informed me, he was dead and buried; that his Will was proved
in the Country, the Contents of which he knew nothing of; but that the
Executors have sold off all his Effects. I wrote last <HI>Tuesday</HI> to
an Attorney near there, to whom I gave Orders to seek out the Executors, and
send me a Copy of the Will. My Time has been some∣what employed in
seeking what Intelligence I could amongst his Acquaintance here, who none
of them had heard of his Death. I ne∣ver had any great Reason to expect any
Thing from this Gentleman; and I think it an Abuse upon a Person's
Credulity, to amuse and de∣ceive one with unmeaning Promises and false
Hopes. If I am disappointed, I will not suf∣fer it to grieve me one Moment,
but forget <PB N="217" REF="235"/> it as soon as possible; to which
Purpose, I will (if Mr. I— can spare me) come down to the
<HI>Leasowes</HI> for a Week or two, as my Cause will not come on these
two Months, I be∣lieve.</P>
<P>I do not find that Mr. COVENTRY and Mr. PYTTS are likely to have an
Opposition in <HI>Worce∣stershire,</HI> therefore my Appearance will not
serve them much, but only will prove an unneces∣sary Expence to myself.
I have been impor∣tuned, by many well-wishers to me, to congra∣tulate Sir
G— L— on his new acquired Ho∣nour. Where would the Advantage be to
either? I declare I would not (contracted as my For∣tune is) willingly accept a
Place of one hun∣dred Pounds <HI>per Annum,</HI> to be confined to one Spot. I
wish I were once fixed at some Cer∣tainty in the Country, and twice that
Sum should not move me. I seemingly contradict myself, but you
understand my Meaning. <HI>I would not sell my Liberty.</HI></P>
<P>Let me beg you to write to me soon; I hope you will be more
capable of so doing than you were a while ago. Remember me 
<PB N="218" REF="236"/> to Lord D—'s Family, whom I wish (the better
Part I mean) Success and Happiness. I can learn no Particulars concerning
Mr. W—'s Affairs. Miss R— dines with me to-morrow, at Dr.

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Arrival of your Servant gave me a retrospective View of my own
intolera∣ble Omissions, and oppressed me with some∣what like the Load
of an evil Conscience. I must allow that Appearances make against me; and
yet I must and will assert, that there is no one has a truer Respect
for Mr. D—, a deeper Sense of his Civilities, a greater Re∣lish for
his Company, or a more lively De∣sire to partake of those Beauties which he
is daily distributing round his Situation. Of these last, Miss F—
F— has sometimes favoured me <PB N="220" REF="238"/> with the greatest
Encomiums: I am sure she knew how much I should enjoy them, and might
also mean them as Inducements (which I never yet wanted) to hasten the
Visit I in∣tended you at <HI>W—.</HI> Alas! neither her Plea∣sure in
giving me these Descriptions, nor mine in receiving them, were unmixed with
Pain; as she was too often forced to adjoin but an indifferent Account of
poor Miss D—'s Health. For this, and for the Affliction it occasions
you and Mrs. D—, I really feel a Concern that I am not satisfied to
express in the ordinary Forms of Condolence.</P>
<P>I have passed this Summer in a Series of Dissipation;
betwixt some Events disagreeable enough, and others that wear at least
the Ap∣pearance of Pleasure. I have done (what <HI>I</HI> must call) a good
deal round my Place. Com∣pany produced new Operations, and new Ope∣rations
produced almost daily Company. The Line of my Path is now almost
universally ex∣tended to the Sides of Hedges, and, together with some
slighter Improvements, have been added two new Cascades: of the first of
these, I believe you have heard some Account; it is <PB N="221" REF="239"/>
really, if you'll pardon such an Expression from the Proprietor, a very
<HI>great</HI> Thing for the <HI>Size</HI> of it.</P>
<P>My Servant has been <HI>weekly</HI> upon the Point of setting out
for <HI>D—</HI> House, ever since the Time I first heard of your
Return to it: but as he is here much less of the Footman or Groom, than the
River-God, he has been al∣most continually called upon to unlock and conduct
his Rivulets; for this Fortnight, in∣deed, or three Weeks last, he has been
less importuned on that Score; but then, during that Space, arrived a
Visitant, who is now with me in the House, and, till the Time of whose
Departure was ascertained, I was unable to fix a Day when I could wait upon
you and Mrs. D—: I hope to do so about the Mid∣dle of next Week; and
will not fail to send TOM over upon <HI>Monday</HI> or <HI>Tuesday.</HI> If
he can be of any possible Service, in Regard to the Cascades you
proposed (and I think his Head a clear one) you are welcome to com∣mand him
over as often as you please. I have detained your Servant much beyond the
Time he purposed to return. I can therefore only <PB N="222" REF="240"/>
desire my best Compliments to Mrs. D—, and assure her, that my
Muse is not less at her Service, and beg your Acceptance of this Ode to,
&amp;c. and would, I am sure, esteem it greater Honour to embellish your
Place than mine. I wish you do not find it obscure; however, if it
discover but an ordinary Talent for Poetry, it will discover at least a
warm Attachment to rural Improvement. With this I shall be quite contented,
so long as I think it has the least Tendency to recommend me to Mr.
D—'s good Opinion.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>The <HI>Leasowes,</HI> 
<DATE><HI>Feb.</HI> 27, 1755.</DATE></DATELINE> 
<SALUTE>Dear Madam,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I FIND it necessary to write to your Lady∣ship this Week, not
being able to endure that you should think hardly of me, during the Time that
may elapse before I can possi∣bly see you. When I have the Honour of
doing so, I trust that I can erase any unfa∣vourable Impressions, and
very fairly acquit myself of all voluntary Neglect; meantime, let me only
beg, that you would suspend your Accusation. I wish I could fix a Time
for the Performance of this Visit, but it is not in my Power: such Weather
as the present does not only numb ones Limbs, but extends its Severity to our
Projects, Hopes and Reso∣lutions. Your Ladyship well knows how Win∣ter
affects <HI>me</HI>; and have indeed yourself re∣marked it in the very Style
of my Letters. <PB N="224" REF="242"/> I am dull enough to be unworthy of a
Con∣versation much inferior to yours; and if I add, that I am a little
peevish withal, I shall do myself no Injustice. Were it then
possi∣ble to retain the same venomous or torpid Qualities, when arrived
upon the Coast of <HI>Bar∣rels,</HI> I ought in common Policy to confine
myself at Home: but I have been, and am confined upon a different Score, a
Kind of Partition-treaty with Master D—, and when this is concluded or
broken off, as I trust will soon be the Case, I shall not then draw
Excuses from the Stupidity with which it is my Fate to be <HI>visited</HI>
in Winter. I have, indeed, some∣times imagined, that I brightened up in your
Company, when I had before esteemed it as impossible as that you should
polish a Piece of Cinder or of Spunge.</P>
<P>I have expected to see DODSLEY's Miscellany advertised six
Weeks ago. Had he allowed me but one Half of this Time to deliberate, I could
have adjusted the Share we have of it much more to my own Satisfaction. I
know but little what he has done, in Consequence of that discretionary
Power, with which, through <PB N="225" REF="243"/> mere Haste, I was obliged
to intrust him; and this possibly at a Time when his own Hurry was as
great as mine. But this I know, that in all I did myself, you may expect to
trace the Finger of Stupidity precipitated.</P>
<P>Stupidity, however, is many an honest Man's Lot; Presumption is
less excusable; and it is with the utmost Humility, that I beg your
La∣dyship's Pardon for the Liberty I took in pro∣posing what I thought
might be an Improvement of your Verses. I have only this to plead, that you
write these lively Pieces almost extempore; that you lay no Stress upon
them, and scarce ever revise them; that, on these Accounts only, I
thought it possible an Expression not altogether exact might here and
there escape you; that finding my Proposals disapproved, I did all my
<HI>Time</HI> would allow, to cause DOD∣SLEY to have Recourse to your
original Rea∣dings; and if he <HI>have</HI> not done so universally, (as I
apprehend may be the Case) those Rea∣dings may be restored in any future
Impres∣sion. I will resume the Subject on some other Occasion; at
present let me only mention, that DODSLEY, when he wrote to me last,
desired my <PB N="226" REF="244"/> Opinion, whether or no he should be
thought impertinent if he presented your Ladyship with a complete Set of
his Miscellanies. It seems the three first Volumes are out of Print at
this Time; but will be reprinted in about a Month: the fourth he gives me
Reason to ex∣pect every Day.</P>
<P>I am particularly glad to hear that your Health is tolerable, during
this rigorous Wea∣ther, as it gives me Room to conceive the Ad∣vantage you may
derive from a better. How do I long for the Approach of Spring! Me∣thinks I
could travel Leagues to meet it, were it possible by so doing to bring it
faster on its Way: and yet, unless it should supply me with Health, as
well as with Company, with Spirits, as well as Spring-Flowers, and in one Word,
enliven both the Farmer, and the Farm, what would it avail? The two Ca∣nary
Birds that were given me about three Weeks ago sing whilst I am writing;
sing from Morn to Night, and that with all the Vigour which the Spring
itself could inspire; yet I do not half enjoy them; my Mind is not in tune:
<PB N="227" REF="245"/> the Commencement of my Spring must receive its Date at
<HI>Barrels.</HI> I am, with constant At∣tachment,</P>

<DATE><HI>March</HI> 21, 1755.</DATE></DATELINE> 
<SALUTE>Dear Mr. GRAVES,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>PARDON the Arrival of this one more Letter without a Frank; I have
sent some Covers to my Lord of <HI>D—,</HI> who is down, and shall
probably enough receive them before I write again.</P>
<P>There is nothing that I can less forgive the World than your Want
of Leisure. Do not misinterpret me, or take amiss what I say. I know
you to be infinitely more happy than <PB N="228" REF="246"/> myself, who am
cloyed with it: but it would add something to my Happiness, if not to your
own, that you had more vacant Spaces or Intervals of Time to employ in those
re∣fined Amusements, for which you are so ex∣quisitely qualified.</P>
<P>I am in doubt, whether I should add Mot∣tos to my Seal, or not
rather cause the Circum∣ference, which at present is rather of the
largest, to be contracted. Should you have struck out any Thing since you
wrote to me, you will be so good as to let me know.</P>
<P>As to Sun-Dials, I never much affected the Things themselves, nor
indeed any Mottos with which I have seen them inscribed; perhaps this
Indifference may arise from no very com∣mendable Sources, a Reflection upon
my own Want of Proficiency in Mathematics, and an habitual Consciousness
of my own Waste of Time. However, I have often had Thoughts of placing a
slight one somewhere upon my Premises, for the Sake of inscribing it
with a Couple of Lines from VIRGIL: 
<Q><PB N="229" REF="247"/> 
<L>Sed fugit interea fugit, irreparabile tempus,</L> 
<L>Singula dum capti circumvectamur amore.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">IMITATED. 
<Q> 
<L>Meantime the Hours, th' irreparable Hours,</L> 
<L>Wing their swift Flight, while Streams, and rural
Bow'rs,</L> 
<L>And Love engage the Mind.</L></Q></NOTE></L></Q></P>
<P><HI>All</HI> the Lines in VIRGIL afford me that Sort of Pleasure
which one receives from melancho∣ly Music; and I believe I am often struck
with the Turn and Harmony of his Expres∣sion, where a Person less
attached to these can discover no great Beauty.</P>
<P>I told you, how much I was vexed that DODSLEY did not suffer me to
avail myself of the Time that passed from the Correction of the
Proof-Sheets to the Publication of his Book. He has at last sent me a Copy,
which I received last <HI>Thursday</HI> Se'en-night. I wish the last
Stanza of WHISTLER's Verses upon Flowers had remained as he himself wrote
it: but being somewhat dissatisfied with the ori∣ginal Reading, and
having no Time left to improve it myself, I left it to D—, who I think
has made it worse; however, in this Respect, and some others, it may be
proper to <PB N="230" REF="248"/> fix one's Eye upon a subsequent
Impression; and DODSLEY has acted as discreetly as it was possible
for him to do, considering what In∣structions were given him, and how
<HI>much</HI> was left to his Discretion. Our Contributions may be said to
begin with Mr. SOMERVILLE's <HI>Ad∣dress, &amp;c.</HI> Page 302; amongst
which he has inserted two Odes (Page 305 and 307) to which I am a Stranger.
The Song marked J. S. H. is my Neighbour Mr. H—'s, who has a pretty
Collection of Drawings, Petrefactions, and Coins. The <HI>Lady of Quality</HI>
you know; and as to all the Pieces that follow, you know the Authors of them as
well as I do. I will not anticipate your own Observations; but I cannot help
remarking that MILTON's <HI>Il Pen∣seroso</HI> has drove half our Poets
crazy: it has, however, produced some admirable Odes to <HI>Fancy,</HI>
amongst which, that of WHARTON (not in this Volume) I think deserves the
Prefe∣rence; and after his, MERRICK's, PENSHURST, and the Ode on
<HI>Solitude</HI> are of the same Tribe, and are good. The <HI>Pleasures of
Melancholy,</HI> and MARIOTT's Ode to <HI>Fancy,</HI> of the same Tribe, are
indifferent. There is nothing I am more pleased with, than Father FRANCIS's
Prayer, <PB N="231" REF="249"/> MRS. BERKLEY repeated it to me in my
Root-House this last Summer, and, I think, said it was Mr. WEST's. I
could wish I had made you some Compliments in this Volume, for particular
Reasons, and had resolutely done so, had your own Diffidence permitted
me.</P>
<P>I have now and then some Thoughts of printing that <HI>Ode to the
Duchess,</HI> together with something sufficient to make a twelve or an
eighteen-penny Pamphlet, about the Time the Parliament rises; but not
unless it sits till <HI>June</HI> as was reported, and not unless you
will pro∣mise me the Favour of your Assistance.</P>
<P>'Tis the Property of great Delicacy, to be often-times too
diffident; possibly then you may not long persevere in that Manner of
spelling your Name, which you seem at present to prefer; yet is nothing
so clear to me, as that yourself and your Relations should spell their
Name GREAVES to the End of the World—<HI>Nati Natorum &amp; qui
nascentur ab illis.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Grandsons, great
Grandsons, and all your Poste∣rity.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="232" REF="250"/>COWPER's Performance is all that you think it:
but would you see both his Style and Sentiments effectually demolished,
look into the Account of Books in that <HI>Gentleman's Maga∣zine</HI> where it
was first advertised.</P>
<P>You will guess that I shall want impatiently to hear from you,
when you have received your Set of Books, or perused them elsewhere.</P>

<SALUTE>Dear Mr. B—,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE affectionate Letter I received from you ought to have been
answered by the next Post; it had been so, if I had pursued the
Dictates of a Heart, I will not say, al∣together <PB N="233" REF="251"/> happy
in our Reconciliation, but more properly in the Manifestation of our
ever-un∣divided Friendship. I have had a large Con∣flux of Visitants this
Summer, and the Dissi∣pation they have occasioned me, was for the most
Part very agreeable. But it must not be by any Accession of
<HI>Pleasure,</HI> that I at∣tempt to excuse my unseasonable Neglect of
writing; for Pleasure I have in writing to my Friends, when my Mind is free
from Anxiety, and that Pleasure connected with a Duty I owe to Friendship,
superior to what is claimable by any mere Visitant or Acquaintance; yet I
can∣not but confess the Change which a very few Years have wrought in me; for
surely it is not long since I wearied you, and the rest of my
Correspondents, with my <HI>Assiduity</HI>; where I now write
<HI>one</HI> Letter, I then wrote <HI>twenty:</HI> mean while, the Warmth of my
Heart is not diminished, with regard to Friendship; I know it from the
Pleasure which the Receipt of your Letter gave me. Of this Kind are the only
Pleasures which accompany us through Life; they encrease upon Repetition,
and grow more lively from Indulgence. 
<Q REND="inline">"<HI>Vient l'Appetit en mangeant,</HI>"</Q> was, I
think, an Answer made <PB N="234" REF="252"/> by a <HI>French</HI> Courtier to
his Sovereign, when it was objected to him by the latter, that there was no End
of his Importunities. But whatever odd Instances may be found of a perverted
Appetite, the Maxim is only univer∣sal, in regard to social Pleasure. The
Case is not the same, with regard to Pleasures of Sense; it is not so
even with regard to Plea∣sures of Imagination. Accordingly, though I first
embellished my Farm, with an Eye to the Satisfaction I should receive from
its Beauty, I am now grown dependent upon the Friends it brings me, for the
principal Enjoyment it affords; I am pleased to find them pleased, and
enjoy its Beauties by Reflection. And thus the durable Part of my Pleasure
appears to be, at the last, of the social Kind.</P>
<P>With much Willingness would I have waited upon your Friend Colonel
C— this Year, but for the perplexing Law-Suit in which I am involved with
young D—. It has made me rude to my Superiors, deaf to all inviting
Of∣fers, and neglectful, at once, to my old Friends and my new. Pray make my
Compliments to him, and assure him how sensible I am of the 
<PB N="235" REF="253"/> Honour he has done me. Another Year, if I live, will, I
hope, make me some Amends for this, by affording me an Opportunity of
wait∣ing upon him and you.</P>

<SALUTE>Dear S—,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM truly glad to hear of your Recep∣tion with our worthy Admiral,
to whom I will take the first Occasion of conveying my Acknowledgments. It
is not quite clear from your Letter, whether you are Mate or Midshipman; but
whatever your Post may be, I hope, and make no Doubt, that you will endeavour
to fill it as becomes you. Should you happen to be continued in the Admiral's
own Ship, you will have the Honour to serve more immediately under the most
generous Man alive; whose Penetration will not suffer any Degree of Merit
to escape his Notice, and who will allow yours the more Consideration, on
Account of his Regard for me. As the best Means, therefore, of promoting your
In∣terest, you will need to concern yourself little further, than to
deserve well; and this by an <PB N="237" REF="255"/> uniform Course of
Diligence and Sobriety, by the strictest Attention to Honour and your
Du∣ty, and by a Conduct entirely free from all Artifice and Disguise. You
have an honest, open Countenance; I do not in the least ques∣tion that
you will verify it in your Behaviour; neither do I drop <HI>any</HI> of these
Hints, as though I mistrusted your Conduct; I do unfeignedly believe them
to be every one superfluous: how∣ever, it may prove a Satisfaction for you to
reflect, that the Temper, which I trust is na∣tural to you, is what I think
most likely to recommend you to the Admiral. And be as∣sured, that you
shall acquire no Reputation in the Service, which shall not be seconded
by all the Interest and good Offices of your affec∣tionate Kinsman,</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>D—,</HI> 
<DATE><HI>Aug.</HI> 19, 1758.</DATE></DATELINE> 
<SALUTE>My dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AFTER a Journey of above a Month, is it not very reasonable to
allow a Man of my Age, a Month to rest himself? I have been here indeed
so long; but Visits, and re∣turning Visits, and Business, have
prevented most of it from being a Time of Rest. I am now set down to
writing Letters, which I ve∣rily believe will take up another Month, for, on
casting up my Accounts of that Kind, I found myself no less than
forty-seven in Debt; a Number, for which I am sure you must pity me.</P>
<P>I don't know how to thank you enough, for all the Pleasure we had
during the Week we were at the <HI>Leasowes.</HI> I have talked of it every
Day since, and dream of it a-nights. If you loved travelling as well as I do,
I should <PB N="239" REF="257"/> certainly beseech you to come and stay a
Month or two here at <HI>Durham</HI>; and I should be the more encouraged to
do so, because our Friend Mr. DODSLEY left us quite in love with the Place;
(I don't mean the Town itself, but the Walks about it.) Indeed, if Wood, and
Water, and Wildness, are the Things that make a Place agreeable, we are as
must obliged to Nature here, and more, than any Town I have ever seen,
either at Home or abroad.</P>
<P>My Obligations to you are not confined to <HI>Shropshire,</HI> and
your delightful Paradise in it; but spread through all the Counties that we
passed; and increased, when we had Time to set down here, from your
Works of another Kind; they often gave me the greatest Plea∣sure, not only
from their Spirit and Elegance, but from the good Heart that shines forth
throughout them. Whatever Excellencies a Writer possesses, and to
whatever Degree, this is the true Sun, that gives the noblest gild∣ing of all
to his Compositions; and you must give me leave to say, that you are the
most sun-shiny Writer of this Kind that ever warmed me.</P>
<P><PB N="240" REF="258"/>If, in the first Month that you can't walk
abroad, you would favour me with the natural History, how, and why, and in
what Order, you laid out every Part of your Gardens, it would not only be a
Continuation of the Plea∣sure you have given me ever since I saw you, but
would be, I dare say, of particular Use to me, as a Guide and
Assistant in many Things, and particularly in those two great Articles
of Vistos and Cascades. What I wrote down, was a mere Skeleton of the
Ground, and was only intended to enable me to take all the Round of it,
whenever I should want to do so, in my Imagination; but what I would beg of
you, is, a more lively Account of a Place, that is so much mine and every
Body's Fa∣vourite.</P>
<P>I went from you to <HI>Scotland,</HI> as I fear too many People do,
with an Expectation of scarce seeing any Thing there worth seeing: but
after passing above one hundred Miles of it, through bad Roads, over
Mountains, by Cottages com∣posed of Dirt, and a barren, bleak Country, we
were very agreeably surprised, on our Approach <PB N="241" REF="259"/>
toward <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> to find ourselves in an open Country, well
cultivated, and in a noble View, that struck us with double Pleasure, from
our being used so long to see almost nothing but what was
displeasing. When you have coasted the <HI>Pentland</HI> Hills, and get
upon a Rising, you see the City all at once, spread in a Line before you,
with the Castle to the right, the Palace and a Rock (the middle Part of which
is called ARTHUR's Seat) to the left; and a vast Bason of Water (the Frith
of <HI>Forth)</HI> ap∣pearing from behind it; the Country near is varied with
little Swells and Risings, and stud∣ded with Villas; the Land spreads on
with a chearful and cultivated Look, and the whole is terminated with a long
Range of Hills, that grow dimmer and ruder, quite on to those of the
Highlands. You may a little conceive of what an Extent this View must be,
when I assure you, that the Bason of Water about the Mid∣dle of it does
not appear at all over-propor∣tioned, and yet we were assured, that it was
sixty Miles long, about thirty in the broadest Part, and fifteen in its
opening to the Sea. I could say much more of this same <HI>Edinburgh,</HI>
but I have been already rather too diffusive.</P>
<P><PB N="242" REF="260"/>When you see Mr. BASKERVILLE, I beg my
Compliments to him, and all the good Family. May you long enjoy the delicious
Spot you live in; and may you always look upon me as a faithful Friend, and one
of</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>your most affectionate humble Servants, J—
S—</SIGNED> <POSTSCRIPT>
<P>P. S. Could you send me a Receipt how to build a Root House?
In my wild Abbey-Grounds, I have a Place that asks for one loudly; but we
have neither any Gentleman or Artist here, who understands any Thing of
that Stile of Architecture.</P>
<P>Secondly, I hope you won't forget your Promise of a Visit to
me at <HI>B—</HI> next <HI>May.</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly, Mr. DODSLEY told me, you de∣sired me to mark any Thing
that I thought suspicious in your Elegies; and wherever I 
<PB N="243" REF="261"/> had the least Feeling of any such Thing in my Mind,
I have writ it down, without much Reason, but with great Honesty. I beg you
would look upon them only as Queries, and not as Assertions.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Covent-Garden,</HI> 
<DATE><HI>Jan.</HI> 31, 1759.</DATE></DATELINE> 
<SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>BEING gone for a few Days to <HI>Hampton-Court,</HI> I did not
receive the Favour of yours so soon as you might naturally imagine,
consequently it was not in my Power to write to you by the returning Post;
and ever since being full of Employment, I deferred that Pleasure till the
present Moment, which I fear will produce little worth your Attention;
how∣ever, such as it is I give unto you.</P>
<P><PB N="244" REF="262"/>In going to <HI>Hampton-Court,</HI> I met with
lit∣tle or nothing curious or entertaining, as in∣deed mere Motion and
Horse-Language are Subjects that afford no great Matter for Nar∣rative. As to
the Place, it is a flat, but very pleasant, and has the Advantage of being
al∣ways dry. The Palace has externally little to recommend it besides Bulk,
and in this Re∣spect, it would excite the Admiration of my Friend Dr.
A—, who would call it a <HI>noble</HI> Pile. There are many grand Rooms
within, and some fine Paintings; but the Method of shewing such Places
would not allow me much Time to examine them. The Gardens are all in the
<HI>Dutch</HI> Taste, with Ever-greens and strait Canals, and some fine
Brass Statues interspersed; there is a Terrass by the Side of the
<HI>Thames</HI> a great Length, with a Wall on one Side, and Iron Pallisades
on the other, which, from the Quantity of Iron and the Workmanship, will
deserve the Approbation of those who deal in that Manufacture, but I think
their least Merit is in the Place they occupy. I took several Walks round
about, and the Number of Gentlemen's Seats and neat Villages in the
Neighbourhood make it a de∣sirable Situation. Mr. GARRICK has built at 
<PB N="245" REF="263"/> <HI>Hampton</HI> a Rotund Temple, in Honour of
SHAKESPEARE, but I could not have an Oppor∣tunity of seeing the Inside of
it. The Morn∣ing I was to go to <HI>London,</HI> the Stage was full, therefore
being very dry and pleasant, I walked to Town; but taking Cold that Night
after∣wards at the Play, I was laid up for a Week. On my Return to
<HI>Covent-Garden,</HI> I found, be∣sides your Letter, a Card from Mr.
D—; I waited on him the next Morning, but had not the Pleasure to find
him at Home; he has since, however, been so obliging as to call on me, when
I told him your Request, which he promised to gratify. He was to have dined
with the Mr. K—s and me on <HI>Sunday</HI> last, but sent us Word, he
had that Morning lost some Blood. Mr. K— promises to write to you
soon; he gave me some of Mr. P—'s Subscrip∣tions, which I make no
Doubt but I shall dispose of as soon as I go abroad; for not having a
single Article of Mourning by me, I am obliged to buy all new, and my Taylor
is a Man of such Consequence, that I have not been able to obtain the
Favour of mine from his Hands yet.</P>
<P><PB N="246" REF="264"/>I have not seen Mr. DODSLEY some Time; I
intend him a Visit soon. I have not met yet with an <HI>Antinous.</HI> Mr.
K— and I shall some Morning scrutinize all the Shops in Town. It is
very odd, that not many Nights ago, I dreamt somebody had made you a
Present of one; if that should happen to be the Case hereafter, I shall
have more Faith in Dreams than ever I had before.</P>
<P>All public Diversions were stopped for a Week on the Death of
the Prince of ORANGE; how the Town so long subsisted without, and what
new Amusement served to kill Time, would be a Subject well worth knowing.
There has been a successful Method thought of to tax Curiosity these
last three Weeks, with the Sight a famous <HI>Mohawk</HI> Warrior, armed with
his Scalping Knife, Battle Axe, &amp;c. and painted in the <HI>Indian</HI>
Manner for War: his Body is stained Mahogany, but his Face is made most
terrific by the Hand of some Sign-Post APPELLES; in his Cheeks, the Red is
very predominant; his Eye-Brows owe their Breadth and Colour to a thick
<HI>Stratum</HI> of Lamp-black, and his Nose is not <PB N="247" REF="265"/>
less remarkable for a large Line of sable. He goes through his Exercise
with great Ex∣pedition; performs the War Dance and Whoop, which is a Noise
unheard in this Part of the World before: all this is very fine, exceeding
curious, &amp;c. but will not you laugh when I tell you who this formidable
Hero is, <HI>Ecce ite∣rum Crispinus!</HI> Mr. FOOTE, and no less a Man; if
'tis not him <HI>in propriâ personâ,</HI> it is one of his
Agents; 'tis certain it is no <HI>In∣dian</HI>; if it was, he could not bear
Confine∣ment: another Circumstance, Mr. FOOTE is missing, and has not
been seen since the Arrival of this <HI>Mohawk,</HI> which gives strong
Proof to suspect him; however, be who he will, he is a clever Fellow, and
has got a great deal of Money. To-morrow Night a new Farce is to be acted at
<HI>Drury-Lane,</HI> for the Benefit of Mr. S—, who has been some Time
confined in <HI>Luke</HI>'s Hospital.</P>
<P>Mr. G— B— is just come from <HI>Bath,</HI> where he
left Mrs. P— in high Spirits, and Mr. and Mrs. B—; Mr. P— is
gone into <HI>Warwickshire,</HI> to attend a Law-Suit; somebody having laid
Claim to a Part of his Estate, which his Fa∣mily <PB N="248" REF="266"/> have
had uninterrupted Possession of, for above fifty Years.</P>
<P>Your State of one Day's Account is, I must confess, very
natural, and too often true, par∣ticularly in some Articles; in return for
it, I am promised by some Gentlemen of my Acquaintance, a true State of
their Expences one Day, which, from the Manner of the Men and Way of Life,
cannot fail of being extraor∣dinary. Some Choice Spirits, to the Number of five
and twenty, agreed to dine at WHITE's; and the Orders were, Get a Dinner as
expen∣sive as you can possibly make it; which was punctually performed,
and, to their great Sur∣prize and Mortification, found that the most
luxuriant Dinner amounted to no more than ten Pounds a Man! This Experiment
served to convince them, that eating was a <HI>mean, pal∣try</HI> Enjoyment,
and only fit for Cits and Al∣dermen, to whom they left it, because it cost
so <HI>little,</HI> and therefore confessed the Supre∣macy of Gaming,
which they embraced as their <HI>Summum Bonum,</HI> for the contrary
Reason.</P>
<P><PB N="249" REF="267"/>Mr. BURKE's Treatise on the <HI>Sublime and
Beautiful</HI> I read almost two Years ago, in his first Edition: the
Pleasure I received from the Perusal, will make me embrace the first
Op∣portunity I have of reading the second—<HI>Quaere,</HI> whether Lady
COVENTRY corresponds with his Idea of Beautiful? The Study of Physic
cer∣tainly will produce in us Admiration; because when we trace the
Mechanism of Nature phi∣losophically, as in the human Body, it becomes an
Object of the Sublime; every Step we take in such Researches, fills us with
amazing In∣stances of Wisdom and Contrivance: but in the living Body,
Nature there conceals her Machinery, and presents to our Eyes a smooth
Object, whose external Figure is moulded with such inimitable Harmony,
such an insensible and pleasing Variation from the right Line,
toge∣ther with such a Delicacy and Transparency in the Skin, that it cannot
fail of exciting our Ideas of Beauty, which as <HI>they</HI> tend to relax the
Solids, will refine them into those of Love. <HI>Quaere</HI> then, if that
Love may not receive additional Force in the Breast of an Anatomist, 
<PB N="250" REF="268"/> from his previous Acquaintance with the in∣ternal
Springs and Structure of such an Ob∣ject, and thereby the better qualified to
judge of the Beauty of the whole? In other Words, may not his Admiration,
co-operating with his Love, make him a more sensible and feeling
Observer? <HI>Argol,</HI> the Study of Physic may be said (if not to
produce) to heighten Love. I submit it to your Decision; for who can paint
Nature, must have <HI>felt,</HI> and who has <HI>felt</HI> is the best
Judge.</P>
<P>I did not understand you literally, that you meant what you wrote:
but as I am, beyond what many may conceive, taken up every Hour of the Day, I
intended my Insinuation of my Industry as a Plea for any seeming Neglect
I might be guilty of towards my Friends, in not writing to them so punctually
as I could wish; for I have known it a Maxim with many, that no People had
so much leisure Time as those who lived in <HI>London.</HI> But let it
not discourage the Oracle; let him deal out with as liberal a Hand as he
pleases, myste∣rious Truths, and they shall be applied to form

<SALUTE>Dear SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Received the Tobacco-Stopper, which my Friend Mr. PERCY bought at
MOODY's Shop, and also the Letter, to authenticate its being made of the Tree
he mentioned. I am also pretty well assured of the Truth thereof, having
lately seen Mr. HOBBS of <HI>Birmingham.</HI> who informs me, that he has a
Piece of the same Tree, which he brought from <HI>Stratford,</HI> in his
Possession. I think the Wood much too spungy to carve neatly on it,
else should <PB N="252" REF="270"/> like to improve a Hint that Mr. HOBBS
gave me, of having a Cup or little Bowl, with some particular Scene out of
one of SHAKE∣SPEARE's favourite Plays carved thereon; how∣ever, if you will get
him to procure (but not at an extravagant Rate) any, or what he can of the
said Mulberry-Tree, I will have something made of it, as shall make it
advantageous to him for undertaking the same, if he pleases. I have Coins
of most Sorts, both <HI>English</HI> and fo∣reign, and some of JAMES the
First, therefore do not want what seems to me to be imper∣fect: however, if
that he mentions was really dug up near the Tree in SHAKESPEARE's Gar∣den, I
shall be glad to give a small Matter more than the Weight for it, and Mr.
HOD∣GETTS, will pay for the same.</P>
<P>I will not apologize for applying to you on this whimsical
Occasion, as I have no other Connections about your Part of the World, by
which I could procure such a Me∣morial of our distinguished Bard. When I
am so happy as to be the Subject of your Pen next, be so good as to give me
your Thoughts on this Kind of <HI>Curiosity,</HI> (or whatsoever else 
<PB N="253" REF="271"/> you please to call it) which induces us to pay a
<HI>Price</HI> for a Morsel of a Tree, planted (as Report says) by
SHAKESPEARE's own Hand; and how far you think such a Passion allow∣able,

<SALUTE>Dear Mr. DODSLEY,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM afraid you think me negligent: know then that I sat down
last <HI>Thursday,</HI> to write you a long Letter, about seven o'Clock
at Night, when I discovered that the Post went out at that very Hour I
sat down to write. I had immediate Recourse to such Con∣solation 
<PB N="254" REF="272"/> as the Case admitted; and supposed a Letter
received on <HI>Monday</HI> Morning, might do near as well as one on
<HI>Saturday</HI> Night, considering that <HI>Sunday</HI> intervened, which
must be a leisure Day, <HI>even</HI> for <HI>Printers.</HI> But in good
Earnest now, do you <HI>think</HI> me lazy? Or have not you, under your
present <HI>Dissipa∣tion,</HI> an <HI>heavier</HI> Complaint against my
<HI>Dili∣gence?</HI> You and I shall hardly agree about the <HI>Means</HI> of
<HI>estimating</HI> Letters; you, conscious of your own Genius, are
desirous to value them by their <HI>Weight</HI>; while I, conscious of my
late <HI>Industry,</HI> would fix their Value by the Number of
<HI>Words.</HI> What Pretensions, pray, can you suggest, for so very
<HI>perverse</HI> a Man∣ner of Reckoning? Is not <HI>Industry</HI> a
<HI>moral Virtue?</HI> And are not many written Words a <HI>Proof</HI> of
Industry? But though your <HI>Ingenuity</HI> be even a Miracle, you will
hardly prove it to be a <HI>moral Virtue,</HI> unless, indeed, in the <HI>Way
you manage it</HI>; and <HI>so, all</HI> your Faculties are moral Virtues:
however, we less <HI>artful,</HI> or less <HI>heroick</HI> Personages,
must magnify the Virtues that we <HI>have</HI>; of these, Industry is
one, though perhaps <HI>this</HI> had been scarce <HI>allowed</HI> me, till
within these three or four <PB N="255" REF="273"/> Months past. I say,
that we, who are the <HI>Animae nil magnae Laudis egentes</HI>;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"> 
<Q REND="inline">"Souls little desirous of Praise."</Q></NOTE>
we, the <HI>Animae viles, inhumata infletaque turba:</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Low Souls—an unburied, and unlamented Multitude.</NOTE> In
other Words, the <HI>Numerus,</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">The Crowd,
born to consume the Produce of the Ground.</NOTE> and the 
<Q REND="inline">"<HI>nati Fruges consumere;</HI>"</Q> if
<HI>we</HI> would appear considerable, pray what Method can we take? I know,
in∣deed, but two; the one of disparaging <HI>your</HI> Abilities, which is
not quite so feasible; the other, of taking all occasion to magnify our
own good Qualities. If then, Industry be a Virtue, I am possessed of
it very remarkably: Not a Moment of my Time passes, but I am employed,
either in overseeing Labourers; reading ROBINSON's <HI>History of
Scotland</HI>; writing in my Paper Books, ('tis not material <HI>what,</HI> but
writing;) perplexing the <HI>Birmingham</HI> Ar∣tists with Sketches for
Improvements in their Manufactures, which they <HI>will</HI> not understand;
and lastly, and finally, feeding my Poultry, my Ducks, my Pigeons, and my
Swans; which last give me as much Pleasure, as what I had be∣fore gave me
Vexation. No inconsiderable Pane∣gyrick, <PB N="256" REF="274"/> I'll
assure you! And surely this is not only <HI>Industry,</HI> but an
<HI>Industry</HI> of a <HI>better Kind</HI> than what employs the <HI>Animae
viles</HI> of a Drawing-room. And now this <HI>last Instance</HI> of my
great Industry puts me in Mind of asking you a Question:</P>
<P>Pray now, you that are a Mythologist, what an absurd Man you
are, not to jump at an Invitation to come directly to the <HI>Leasowes?</HI>
Here am I, (like your Friend AESOP, before OGILBY's <HI>Fables</HI>; or like
ADAM, in our old <HI>Bibles</HI>) sitting once or twice a Day with eve∣ry
created Animal before me. Is not this the only Residence for a Person that
is writing Fables? 'Tis true, this very Person may con∣template better in a
<HI>Crowd,</HI> than <HI>another</HI> in the Depth of Solitude: <HI>you</HI>
may far surpass <HI>me,</HI> who thus <HI>converse</HI> with
<HI>Birds,</HI> while he describes a Sparrow from <HI>Pall-Mall,</HI> or a
King-fisher from <HI>Charing-Cross:</HI> but <HI>Imagination</HI> is a
pro∣digious <HI>Heightener</HI>; and unless he paints them from Life, may he
not <HI>attribute</HI> to a <HI>King-fisher</HI> much finer Feathers than he
in Truth possesses? Pray take the Opinion of Mr. SPENCE—How I
blush, while I recollect that Name! <PB N="257" REF="275"/> And yet, were it
not for my <HI>own</HI> Omissions, it must revive <HI>only</HI> my most
<HI>favourite</HI> Ideas. Surely 'tis written in the Book of Fate, that I
shall discharge my Debt within a Post or two; for Fate evidently enough
interferes, or I could never have been so long silent. I am almost
ashamed to desire my humble Respects to him, and yet it is impossible
for me to sup∣press my Feelings.</P>
<P>I must now proceed to Business. Past six o'Clock once
more; but the Post now goes out at ten. If you <HI>can</HI> procure me the
quarto Cuts for MILTON, it will be a very desirable Fa∣vour.</P>
<P>Mr. BOND has made some Alteration in your <HI>Grove,</HI> which I
thought very pretty on its <HI>Arrival</HI>; yet, perhaps, he may be right
enough, if Mr. GRIGNION can comprehend his Meaning. The Trees he means <HI>on
the wrong Side the Water,</HI> are some of those opposite to the Letter
<HI>S,</HI> which I have put upon the Back: but I am fearful of
<HI>spoiling</HI>; and must beg Mr. GRIGNION would re-compare the Print
with Mr. BOND's original Drawing, then retouch his <PB N="258" REF="276"/>
Plate, and let me have a few more Proof-Sheets of both the Prints. Give me one
or two Lines by <HI>Return</HI> of Post, if possible.</P>

<SALUTE>Dear SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is, perhaps, no uncommon Case for the Magnitude of a Debt to
prevent, or at least retard every Step toward a Discharge. In Truth, the
many Favours you have con∣ferred upon me by the Packet I have received 
<PB N="259" REF="277"/> for <HI>E—,</HI> have made me ashamed of such
a partial Payment, as my Health and Lei∣sure would permit; when I complain of
Health, I mean no other than a Kind of Drowsihead and Lentor which has
somewhat infested me at this Season; perhaps it were better expressed
by that disreputable Name, Stupidity: be that, however, as it may, it is by
this chiefly, I have been disqualified from those refined Sorts of
Amusement, in which your Letters and Pac∣kets required me to engage.</P>
<P>I have been expected to pass a Week at <HI>Shiffnal,</HI> ever
since the Beginning of <HI>May,</HI> where I was by particular Appointment to
meet our Friend Mr. BINNEL. The Visit is not laid aside, but will probably
take Place in about a Fortnight's Time or less. One Pleaure I expect from it,
beside what I shall reap from Mr. PITT and Mr. SLANEY's Com∣pany, and that
turns upon the Opportunity it will afford me of perusing your OVID in
Conjunction with Mr. BINNEL; and it has been with this View, in some
Measure, that I have deferred the Examination you desired me to bestow
upon it. In general, I would <PB N="260" REF="278"/> wish you to make it as
just to the Author's Sense, and to your own Sentiments, as you can, and
afterwards consider me as a mere Music Master, whom you would employ to
tune your Harpsichord; in other Words, as a proper Person to retrench any
little Encroachments upon Simplicity, Ease of Style, or Harmony.</P>
<P>I want to communicate many Things; but must defer most of them
till I see you. And pray let Mrs. PERCY know me for one of your peculiar
Friends, and then I hope she will not scruple to reward me with an
irregular Visit, by Way of Distinction. I brought my Friend JAGO's new
Bride to pay me that Compli∣ment the other Day.</P>
<P>Mr. DODSLEY in his last Letter desired, I would present you
with his new Edition of <HI>Cleone,</HI> which is the only one you should
pre∣serve. It is, according to my best Calculation, improved in about an
hundred Places merely, and altered in about six. I will either keep it till

Stanzas must undoubtedly approach nearer to what was the original Reading,
than those which I have substituted, and which I will not send you now,
because I will multiply your In∣ducements to visit my Place in the proper

<P>You must by all Means read Dr. YOUNGE's <HI>New Conjectures on
original Composition</HI>; and let it deter you, when you have compleated
OVID, from engaging in any more Translations. I have also read the
Essay on the present State of Learning, written by a Dr. GOLDSMITH, whom
you know, and whom such as read it will desire to know. LA MOTTE also has
afforded me no little Entertainment: I read it on Account of DODSLEY, who you

<SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Finished my Peregrinations the Day before you began yours; for
the Day after my Arrival at this Place, I called at your Lod∣gings, and was
informed you set off that very Morning for Mr. SHENSTONE's. I have of∣ten
thought you, in many Respects, a Man to be envied; but in your present
Situation, you are in Possession of a Happiness too great for
Mortals; enjoying in one of the hottest Seasons that ever was known in
<HI>England,</HI> the Shade and Coolness of the finest Groves per∣haps in
the World, rendered still more en∣chanting by the Conversation of one of
the best Poets, as well as one of the worthiest Men of the Age. A certain
Monarch of old <PB N="263" REF="281"/> broke off all Connexion and Alliance with
a Brother King in <HI>Greece,</HI> for no other Reason, but because the
other experienced an uncommon Share of Felicity. If his Example deserved to
be followed, you are the Man of all others, whose Friendship I would
renounce. But the Truth is, you cannot have more Happiness than I wish you;
nor more, I am persuaded, than you deserve; and therefore, I will e'en be
contented to hold on my Amity with you, till I have a better Reason for
parting with it, which I am very sure I shall never be fur∣nished
with.</P>
<P>With Respect to my own Travels, I have little to say worth
relating. Finding my Health not equal to so long a Journey as to
<HI>Scarborough,</HI> and the Weather at the same Time proving extremely cold
and wet, I turned out of the high Road at <HI>Newark,</HI> and crossed the
Coun∣try to <HI>Nottingham.</HI> As I found the Air of the Place agree with me,
and likewise met with an old Friend, who lives like a true <HI>Arcadian,</HI>
in a little rural Cottage, at a short Distance from the Town, I continued
there till my Re∣turn hither. I saw every Thing in the Neigh∣bourhood 
<PB N="264" REF="282"/> worth looking at; but what pleased me most was Lord
BYRON's Abbey upon the Forest, which without Doubt you have visited. Adieu,
dear Sir.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>Oct.</HI> 12, 1759.</DATE></DATELINE> 
<SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHAT Apology can I make for not writing to you now for more than a
Month, after receiving so much Pleasure and so many Civilities? However,
as you too well know how easy it is for such Things to hap∣pen, I will make
none, but leave you to <HI>for∣give us our Trespasses, as we forgive them
that trespass against us.</HI> And this would lead me to expostulate
with you for not coming <PB N="265" REF="283"/> to <HI>Bath:</HI> but I forbear,
having many Things to be pardoned in myself, as well as many to deliver to
you, and therefore so much for Apo∣logy.</P>
<P>I have seen <HI>Persfield,</HI> Mr. MORRIS's Seat; and Mr. SPENCE
was just come from seeing it, when he arrived at <HI>Bath:</HI> he is much
struck with it, and has attempted somewhat towards a Description of it. I
shall have a Copy of his Papers soon, and will transmit it to you. The
Place is certainly of the great and sub∣lime Kind; most of the near Views
are seen below you from the Top of high Precipices, consisting of steep
Rocks, hanging Woods, the Rivers <HI>Severn</HI> and <HI>Wye,</HI> which last
winds about the Feet of the Rocks below you, in a very romantic Manner,
almost surrounding a very pretty Farm, where Cattle and Sheep are feed∣ing
in the Meadows, at such a Depth below your Eye, that they seem very much
diminished. The Rocks are bold and numerous, half co∣vered with Woods, and
rise almost perpendi∣cular from the Edge of the Water to a sur∣prising
Height, forming, from the great Cliff, a Kind of double Amphitheatre. A Gun
fired <PB N="266" REF="284"/> from the Top of this Cliff, creates, by the
Reverberation of the Report amongst other Rocks, a loud Clap of Thunder, two
or three Times repeated, before it dies away: but even this Echo, conformably
to the Pride and Gran∣deur of the Rest of the Place, will not deign to
answer a smaller Voice than that of a Mus∣ket; with a Culverin, I
suppose, it would hold a noble Dialogue. The Town of <HI>Chepstow,</HI>
and its ruined Castle, appear in the near View at somewhat more than the
Distance of <HI>Hales Owen</HI> from your Grove; and the romantic Windings of
the <HI>Wye</HI> are seen all the Way to them, except now and then that its
Stream is hid among the Rocks; and all the Way below them, till it is
swallowed up by the <HI>Se∣vern,</HI> at about two miles Distance, where
that River is also near two Miles over, and from whence it extends, enlarging
in Breadth, quite down to <HI>King-Road,</HI> below <HI>Bristol.</HI> I can
con∣ceive nothing finer than these Views would be, were the Waters of the
Rivers as clear as that of the <HI>Thames:</HI> but, alas! they are so muddy,
that they will scarce return the Images of the Rocks, Trees, and other
Objects, that rise upon their Banks. The distant Views are very
ex∣tensive, <PB N="267" REF="285"/> and lets the Eye into Parts of four∣teen
different Counties. The Extent of the Walks is near four Miles, which in about
five Hours Time I made shift to accomplish. I went from <HI>Bath</HI> with
a polite Party of Gen∣tlemen and Ladies, and our three Days Ex∣cursion was
altogether exceedingly agreeable.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I am this Instant
favoured with a more particular De∣scription of the Scenes and Views I have

<HEAD>LETTER LXVIII. Mr. DODSLEY to W. SHENSTONE, Esq.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>Dec.</HI> 1, 1759.</DATE></DATELINE> 
<SALUTE>Dear Mr. SHENSTONE,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Suppose you have some Time ago received from my Brother the
Things you ordered. I desired him to send them, as also the Poems for Mr.
WOODHOUSE, to whom I beg my Com∣pliments, and am sorry he had them not
sooner, but I had really forgot them. I have been such a Rambler since I
came to Town, that I have not had Time to attend to any Thing. I have not
written a single Fable since that I sent you, and yet am so
unreasonable, as to wonder you have not sent me your half Dozen. I am
writing an Essay on Fable, and thinking of a Preface, both of which I
shall desire you to take the Trouble of reading and correct∣ing, as soon
as I have done them; however, I believe I shall take your Advice, and not
think of printing this Winter. I was glad to hear you had some Hopes of
finishing your <PB N="272" REF="290"/> Affairs with Mr. D—, and hope
they are com∣pleated to your Satisfaction. I have been fa∣voured with a Letter
from Mr. WREN, which I answer by this Post. You said, my Lord LYTTELTON
was to be at the Admiral's till af∣ter Christmas, but I saw him pass by
in his Chariot a few Days ago. You have given me Hopes of seeing a Survey of
your Farm; I beg you will not delay what will give me so much Pleasure:
would to God you would bring it yourself, with all your verbal
Descriptions, Mottoes, &amp;c. and let them be engraved and printed. I wish
I could hear that you was writ∣ing somewhat. What think you of an Elegy on
the Death of General WOLFE? You know, I suppose that he was to have been
married to a Sister of —, before he went on his last Expedition, but
that she desired it might be deferred till his Return. I think the Scene
might be laid in her Chamber, on the re∣joicing Night for the taking of
<HI>Quebec</HI>; her Friends may be supposed to have concealed his Death
from her, and her Anxiety for his Welfare, in the Midst of the Rejoicings,
might have a fine Effect: when suddenly his Ghost should appear, inform
her of his Fate, and <PB N="273" REF="291"/> endeavour to comfort her in her
Affliction. Here is Room for Description, Reflection, and the true Pathetic.
Such a Story as this in your Hands could not fail to be fine: I wish you to
try, and that right soon.</P>
<P>I have searched all the Shops in <HI>London</HI> for a
<HI>Pan</HI> proper for the Subject we talked of, but in vain. What think you
of the enclosed Sketch? I think it might be mended. Is not the left Hand
raised too high?</P>
<P>I had written thus far on <HI>Saturday</HI> After∣noon, when your
Letters and Plans arrived by the Penny-Post, which determined me to stay
till <HI>Tuesday</HI> before I finished my Letter. You have now
embarrassed me; I have so many Things to reply to, that I know not where
to begin: I must take them as they lie.</P>
<P>Did I ever tell you of Mr. P—'s <HI>Chinese</HI> Novel? If I
did, I have quite forgot it, and will therefore never own it. I shall be very
glad to see Mr. H—'s Picture: my Compli∣ments to him, and tell him, I
suspect he in∣tends it as a reconciling Present to Miss S—. 
<PB N="274" REF="292"/> I wish Mr. ALCOCK would finish my two Draw∣ings for
the Fables; as to my Face, it is a Subject not worth considering; however, I
will make you an impudent Proposal: if you will exchange Faces with me when
you come up to Town, we will both sit to the same Painter.
Notwithstanding you have taken Pains to for∣feit all Claim to Favour from Mr.
SPENCE, I am very well satisfied, the Letter you pro∣mise will effectually
cancel all your Offences: I shall go down to him in about a Month, (you see
I give you Time enough) enclose it to me, and I will carry it to him, with
one of your small Plans, to which I will put Re∣ferences; at the same Time,
I will endeavour to get the <HI>Scotch</HI> Paper on Gardening. As to my Sketch
of the <HI>Leasowes,</HI> I have not yet had Time to think of it; but as
soon as I have finished my Essay, especially if you make it
unnecessary for me to write any more Fables, by sending me your half
Dozen, I will certainly sit down to it; you see I am willing to make good
Bargains. The Duchess of SOMERSET's Letters I have safe, and will send
them to you. I am glad Mr. GRAVES is going on; and doubt not but the Work 
<PB N="275" REF="293"/> will turn to his Advantage. I shall certainly not
print the Fables this Winter; and as to the Essay, I hope to have gone
through it in about a Fortnight. I have read Dr. HAWK∣SWORTH's
<HI>Adventurer</HI> on the Subject, in which I exactly agree with you; and I
have read a bad Translation of LA MOTTE's Essay: I know nothing else on
the Subject worth rea∣ding. When I send you my Essay, I beg you will give
it any Improvement which you may think it wants, either in correcting
Im∣perfections, or in supplying Deficiencies. I have got six more new
Fables from Dr. L—.</P>
<P>Do not think that I will tamely hear my Friend's <HI>Custard</HI>
abused; I shall certainly find a Time to vindicate his Honour, and to make
your proud Foreigner own the superior Merit of <HI>English</HI>
Custard.</P>
<P>And now for your Plans: I am much obliged to you for sending them;
and if I might have my Wish, I would engrave the small coloured one, with
Figures of Reference. This should be the Frontispiece to a Pamphlet, which
should contain a Description of the Places and Things referred to,
somewhat more at large <PB N="276" REF="294"/> than they are in this Drawing;
together with all your Mottos, Verses, Compliments, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as
also a verbal Description of the rising and fall∣ing of the Ground; the
Objects, Prospects, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> all the Way round. In the Middle of the
Title-Page, I would put the last Plate of VIRGIL's <HI>Grove</HI>; as a
Head-piece at the Beginning of the Pamphlet, I would have a Print of your
House; and at the End, which should be contrived to be almost a whole
Page, I think the chief Cascade might be placed. The Plate should be worked
off in Green; the Road through the Path round the House, and the Water,
should be afterwards coloured by Hand. Think of these Things; and may
Heaven give you Resolution to put them in practice!</P>
<CLOSER>
<SIGNED>I am, dear Sir, most affectionately yours, R.
DODSLEY.</SIGNED> <POSTSCRIPT>
<P>P. S. Get a Drawing, by BOND, of the great Cascade, and of your
House, of a pro∣per <PB N="277" REF="295"/> Size, and I will be at all other
Expence; and if you have any Delicacy about being the Editor of this
yourself, I will write a short Preface, and sign my Name to it, in which
I will say, that I teized you into it, which is no more than Truth.</P>

<P>HEALTH, Happiness, and all the Com∣pliments of the Season, to
dear Mr. SHENSTONE! I have enquired of all the SPILS∣BURY's in Town, but I
cannot find that my little Drawings are yet sent up. This, if Mr. ALCOCK be
still with you, I wish you would be so good as to tell him, with my

when am I to have your half dozen Fables? I have sent my

this Night's Post, with a Desire, that he will transmit them to you in a
Post or two. When you get them, I shall be very glad if you will look them
carefully and cri∣tically over: they are both very short; and there are blank
Pages on one Side, for what∣ever Alterations or Remarks you shall favour me
with. I beg you will be so good as to let me have them back, with your
Fables, as soon as possible. I shall not publish this Win∣ter: but I
want to have all my Materials to∣gether, that I may begin to think of
dispo∣sing them in the Order they are to stand.</P>
<P>I have Compliments to you from Mr. SPENCE, and he is much obliged to
you for the Sur∣vey of your Farm. He has never been able to get DALRYMPLE's
<HI>Essay on Garden Grounds.</HI> I enclose a few Lines on the
<HI>Leasowes.</HI> If you should think them not totally unworthy of the
Subject, I should be glad if you would please to bestow such Correction
upon them as you may think will tend to their good. I have other Matters to
communicate to you, and to advise with you about; but you have

<OPENER><DATELINE>The <HI>Leasowes,</HI> 
<DATE><HI>Jan.</HI> 7, 1761.</DATE></DATELINE> 
<SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM with you aware, that the Story of the <HI>Spanish Lady</HI>
is rather too simple, too de∣stitute of Matter for the Generality of People
who frequent the Galleries of a <HI>London</HI> Thea∣tre; but might not some
Incidents of Humour be extracted from the Group of Sailors, which must
necessarily be introduced in the Piece? There are in real Life various, and
very stri∣king Characters among our <HI>English</HI> Tars. In∣deed, 
<PB N="280" REF="298"/> much Use has been made of them al∣ready, and to very
pleasing Purposes.</P>
<P>Observe, I propose (or rather merely <HI>allow</HI>) this
Violation of the Simplicity of the Story, as a Means to make it answer the
Purposes of Emolument to you, if you choose to under∣take it; for, as far
as relates to my own Taste, I think, even in Representation, it could not
be preserved too simple.</P>
<P>The Consideration that an Author is com∣pelled to forego, in many
Instances, his fa∣vourite Intention, renounce a Compliance with his own
Judgment, and even sometimes abo∣lish the very Excellencies of his Genius,
to gratify the vitiated Taste of a few noisy Au∣ditors, who otherwise
would condemn the Work, is rather melancholy; and could not by any Species of
Reason be supported, except that which you advanced, namely, that your
Thea∣tres in <HI>London</HI> are maintained in these Days at a very great
Expence, and that Expence must be repaid; consequently, if SHAKESPEARE
cannnot elicit a full House, HARLEQUIN must extort it; but woe the while
for the State of <PB N="281" REF="299"/> Letters and Genius!—Such was not
the ge∣nuine End and Intention of a Theatre. I, for my own Part, look upon it
as a Temple raised to <HI>Moral Virtue</HI>; the Design of it is to
instruct through the Medium of Delight; to shew Virtue and Vice in their
respective Co∣lours: and the Business of the Audience is, to judge,
compare, define, to distinguish between what is given for Example, and what
for Pre∣caution: so conducted and preserved, a Thea∣tre truly merits the
Denomination I have given it; but if <HI>Moral</HI> is to submit to
<HI>Matter,</HI> if <HI>fine Sentiment</HI> is to give Way to <HI>fine
Scenery,</HI> it falls from the Purposes for which is was originally
instituted, and becomes a Place of <HI>Shew</HI> indeed, but not of
<HI>Science,</HI></P>
<P>All these Absurdities and Misfortunes are owing to the Audience;
and it is much to be lamented, that the Conductor of an useful Place of
Amusement cannot oppose and rectify them; but I clearly see he cannot.
Your Anecdote of Mr. GARRICK's laudable Attempt, some Years ago, to remove
from public View an annual Object of Indecorum and Immorality, and
substitute a Piece, which (however antique) <PB N="282" REF="300"/>
furnished Matter for the moral HOGARTH to display his Genius on, diverts me
much, and would (were I of any Country beside <HI>England)</HI> most
probably astonish me. As an <HI>Englishman</HI> it does not. The Attempt
was as much to the Credit of Mr. GARRICK, as the Defeat of it was
disreputable to the Audience.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It had been a Custom
at both the royal Theatres, for many Years, to perform the <HI>London
Cuckolds</HI> on the Lord-Mayor's Day; Mr. GARRICK, from Motives of Pro∣priety,
endeavoured to substitute the old Play of <HI>East∣ward-Hoe</HI>; but the
Audience exploded it.</NOTE></P>
<P>This Subject might, I think, by itself fur∣nish Matter for a
tolerably-sized Essay; and I marvel that some Writer, who has rather
more Affection for the Use of a Pen than myself, does not adopt it. A
Reflection on the very severe Trial a dramatic Writer undergoes, when he
offers his Work to the Public, has frequent∣ly called forth my Compassion;
the Means to procure general Approbation are so vague and precarious, that I
almost wonder when I hear of any one hardy enough to stand a Can∣didate for
it.</P>
<P>My Zeal in these Particulars has made me deviate from the
principal Object of this Let∣ter, <PB N="283" REF="301"/> which was to request
you to make a lit∣tle Sketch of my favourite Story upon drama∣tic Principles,
during the Course of this Win∣ter; and let us <HI>(Deo favente)</HI> when
next we meet at the <HI>Leasowes,</HI> see how the Design ap∣appears. It
may be an agreeable Amusement, if it answers no other Purpose.</P>
<P>Whether I may ever execute the Elegy which Mr. DODSLEY has
recommended, is very uncertain, though I much approve his Plan. Suppose you
were to attempt it—I have some Reasons for thinking that Elegy would
suit your Disposition and Abilities. The Men∣tion of DODSLEY's
Application<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Letter lxviii. <HI>Dec.</HI> 1,
1759.</NOTE> to me has procured me <HI>twelve</HI> Lines, for which I hold
myself indebted. You do not tell me who they were written by, so I
suppose I am to ask no Questions.</P>
<P>When you get any more such original Mor∣sels, your communicating
them will be a Kind∣ness. While I am thus a Winter Solitudina∣rian, while 
<Q><PB N="284" REF="302"/> 
<L>Scarce one Friend my Grass-grown Threshold finds,</L></Q>
You can hardly conceive how much Value such Trifles bear.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER LXXI. Miss M— to W. SHENSTONE, Esq.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Bath,</HI> 
<DATE><HI>July</HI> 21, 1760.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>SCARCE was I sat down after our agree∣able Jaunt, when I was
welcomed by my dear Mr. SHENSTONE's polite Favour. You are particularly good in
conferring so much Honour on a poor, prattling, insignificant Being like
me; yet, however ill I may confess I de∣serve it in my Ability to repay it,
I will ven∣ture to affirm, that my Merits, if rated by the Value I set on it,
are equal to those of any other wild Female in the Circle of your
Acquaintance. But is it come to this? And must I really take Pen in Hand, and
describe our little Peregrinations? I must, for you have commanded me. If I
even wanted an Induce∣ment beyond your Command, it is at Hand. I mean our
common Friend, Mr. HULL. I applied to him for Counsel, and he flatly says,
I shall be <HI>rude,</HI> if I decline to obey. Here then, my 
<PB N="286" REF="304"/> good Sir, take it in the best Manner I am able to
execute a descriptive Letter, and if it is badly done, you must be my
Advocate to yourself, for having drawn me into such a Dilemma; in short,
your own humane Heart must make Allowances for whatever is un∣worthy your
Judgment.</P>
<P>Be it known unto you then, that last <HI>Wed∣nesday</HI>
Morning, we all four (you know our Party) got into a Coach, at six o'Clock,
and drove at no slow Rate, for we got to <HI>Bristol</HI> at eight. There
we were met by a Gentleman and a Lady from the Hot-well, as wild and as
whimsical as ourselves; we are all of a Spinning I can tell you. We just
took a Bit of Breakfast at <HI>Bristol,</HI> and then made the best of
our Way to <HI>Aust,</HI> the old Passage over to <HI>Wales</HI>; there
we dined, and then, after dri∣ving a long Way over the Rocks, amongst
Sea-Weed, and I can't tell what, with some Difficulty we got into a
<HI>Stable,</HI> in which we were to cross the Water—A Stable! methinks
I hear you say—Why yes, in Truth, good Sir; for pray what can one
better compare a Thing to, that was littered from one End to the 
<PB N="287" REF="305"/> other with dirty Straw, and filled with as many Horses
as People? Oh, we went most socia∣bly over, Horses, Coach, and
ourselves, all to∣gether: this, however, was the worst of the Bargain, all
the best was to come.</P>
<P>When we arrived in <HI>Wales,</HI> we just took a little
Refreshment, and then drove to <HI>Chepstow,</HI> remarkable for the great
Height of its Bridge, the Tide rising higher by some Degrees there than in
any Part of the three Kingdoms. At this Place we were to sleep, so we went
to the best Inn to get Accommodations. These secured, we made the best
of our Way to <HI>Persfield,</HI> the Seat of Mr. MORRIS; and such a Place,
for the Variety and Beauty of its Prospects, I never saw.</P>
<P>The Gardens are seven Miles round, so our poor old Lady was
forced to occupy a Seat just by the House, and the rest of us then walked
as far as our Legs were able to carry us. We could not compass the whole
round, but saw all the principal Prospects. To at∣tempt describing them
is impossible, at least to do it with Justice to their Merit, yet,
though <PB N="288" REF="306"/> unequal to the Task, I must say
something. The Gardens are situated on the <HI>Rocks,</HI> I can∣not call
them the <HI>Banks,</HI> of the River <HI>Wye,</HI> and cut into Walks, in
themselves excessively beautiful, but the superior Beauty of the Views
they command, so entirely engrosses the Eye, that they can be very little
heeded. Some∣times we look down upon the River, from an Eminence of near four
hundred Feet, which winds itself round as in a Semi-circle. The opposite
Side is bounded by Rocks of equal Height, some barren, and resembling the
Ruins of old Fortifications; others covered with the most pleasing Variety
of Greens the Eye can wish to behold, while at the Bottom, Cattle are feeding
in the sweet Pastures by the Ri∣ver's Side: Cattle, we were told the
Creatures were which we saw; but really our Faith had need be strong to
believe it, since they appeared to our View more like Hens and Chickens, and
I do assure you, one of our Company took them for such.</P>
<P>Here too we saw a Place called the <HI>Lover's-Leap,</HI> it was
at the Summit of a Rock full four hundred Feet high from the River, and 
<PB N="289" REF="307"/> I believe, if used, would be a certain Cure for Love
or any other Kind of Trouble. Af∣ter having delighted our Eyes as long as our
Feet would support us, we went back to the reverend Lady; and one of our
Company being acquainted with a Lady at Mr. MORRIS's House, we were invited
to eat a Bit of Cake and drink a Glass of Wine; this was a most agreeable
Repast after our Fatigue, and helped us on very notably. But here, methinks,
I hear you say, Alas, the poor old Lady! She saw none of these fine
Sights!—Yes, but she did, Sir, as you shall hear: We had a Servant of
Mr. MORRIS's to attend our Coach, and he con∣ducted us through various Fields
to some Views we had not seen in the Part of the Gardens we walked over,
and from these the reverend Dame feasted her Eyes; so you see she
came in for a Share of the Show.</P>
<P>We now returned to <HI>Chepstow,</HI> where, after spending as
laughable an Evening as could be desired, (I have before told you, we were
all of a Spinning) we retired to rest, a Thing not at all unpleasing after
the Employment of the Day.</P>
<P><PB N="290" REF="308"/>Next Morning we got into a large Boat, with
two Pair of Oars, and went up the Ri∣ver <HI>Wye,</HI> to a Place called
<HI>Tintern-Abbey.</HI> Here we had the extreme Pleasure of contemplating the
most curious Piece of Ruins I ever beheld; I do not believe your
<HI>Balbecks</HI> or <HI>Palmiras</HI> can much exceed it. It is the Remains of
a Cathedral; all the outside Walls remain so far entire, as to be a Fence
to keep People out, but are in a cracked, ruinous State; most of the Pil∣lars
on the Inside are standing, though robbed of the fine Carving which adorned
them; yet we had some Notion of their former Beauty, from many Pieces
tolerably intire, which lay scattered here and there on the Ground. Grass
and Wood Strawberries here supply the Place of a Pavement, except in one
small Part, where it has not yet been broken. Here is discerni∣ble a very
pretty Kind of Tile OF Stone, the Ground yellow, flowered with black.</P>
<P>The Top of the Church is entirely off, so that Birds build all
around in the Pillars and Walls. There are planted a great Va∣riety of Trees in
many Parts of the Edifice, <PB N="291" REF="309"/> some Fruit-Trees: I
myself eat three Straw∣berries I gathered in the Body of the Church. This
Place, it seems, was dedicated to the Virgin MARY, and Part of an Image
remains, which still bears some Resemblance to her. There is likewise
one of an Earl of PEM∣BROKE, formerly Lord of the Place; that Earl who was
sirnamed <HI>Strong-Bow,</HI> and as Tradition says, who had five Fingers
and two Thumbs on each Hand; one Hand of the monumental Figure is so perfect,
that we could distinguish the five Fingers and two Thumbs. In short, I
never in my Life saw any Place so well worth visiting of its Kind as this
<HI>Tintern-Abbey,</HI> and we were as loath to quit it, as I seem now to be
of finishing my wild Description.</P>
<P>Next we went to look at some Iron Works, and saw the Manner of
making Bar Iron, and Drawing of Wire. After this we got again into our Boat, to
return to <HI>Chepstow,</HI> and as we rowed along the River, had the
Pleasure of looking up to those beautiful Rocks we had looked down from, in
Mr. MORRIS's Ground. This Reverse of View made a second Enjoyment, and we
were more sensible of the <PB N="292" REF="310"/> Height of the Mountains in
this Situation, than when we were at the Summit of them. So delightful was this
Water-Scene, that we all wish∣ed a Continuance of it. This put us upon
ask∣ing the Master of the Boat, if he could safely ven∣ture to land us in
<HI>England</HI>; he assured us he could, and then it was resolved,
<HI>nem. con.</HI> only to stop at <HI>Chepstow</HI> to dine—we did
so, and sending our Carriage and Horses to the Passage, to be again
taken over in the before-mentioned Stable, we went on board our Boat, and rowed
till we got into the <HI>Severn,</HI> and then the Wind favouring us, we had a
most charming sail to the opposite Shore. Here we had another Piece of
Variety; the River was not deep enough from the Rocks to bring the Boat to dry
Ground, nor shallow enough to let the Car∣riages come to us, so we were all
compelled to be carried out on Men's Shoulders.</P>
<P>We drank Tea at the old Passage-House, and then drove to the
Hot-well, <HI>Bristol,</HI> but made <HI>King's-Weston-Down</HI> in our
Way, which, for the Beauty of its Prospects, could well vie with what we had
been seeing in <HI>Wales.</HI> Next Morning our first Route was up to
<HI>Clifton,</HI> <PB N="293" REF="311"/> where we saw Mr. GOLDNEY's Grotto;
of its Kind, to be sure, the most finished Thing; all Description
must fail to do it Justice, so let your Imagination form the most
regular, elegant, costly Arrangement of Shells it is able, and it can't go
beyond the real Beauty.</P>
<P>From a Part of Mr. GOLDNEY's Garden, we had a Prospect I think
rather superior to what we saw in <HI>Wales</HI>; it was, if I mistake
not, more extensive, commanding a full Scope of the <HI>Severn</HI> losing
itself in the Sea, an en∣tire, and uninterrupted View of <HI>Bristol,</HI>
and as fine a rural Prospect around, as the Eye could wish to behold.</P>
<P>Are you not, my good Sir, almost weary with reading? I am of
writing, I can assure you; and I fear you'll not make out what I have wrote
without some Difficulty. But my Ideas of this charming Scene flowed so
fast, I could not keep my Pen in any Order, it run on, and I must beg you
to take it as it is, for I have not Time to write a fair Copy.</P>
<P><PB N="294" REF="312"/>Mr. HULL, I take it for granted, will have the
Happiness to deliver this Scrawl of mine, as he sets out for
<HI>Warwickshire</HI> to-morrow Morning. He has been endeavouring to
per∣suade us to another Jaunt incontinently, and to let him guide us to the
sweetest Retirement in the World, such he calls the <HI>Leasowes.</HI>
That Happiness is denied us at present, but I trust will not be always
so.</P>
<P>I hope, my good Sir, this implicit Obe∣dience to your Commands, will
entitle me to some small Degree of Approbation, and that you will continue
to esteem me</P>

<DATE><HI>Feb.</HI> 25, 1754.</DATE></DATELINE> 
<SALUTE>Dear Madam,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>PRAY never think Excuse can be necessary to me about
Exactness in answering my Letters; I am always glad to hear from you when
it is agreeable to you to write, but am not one of those over-kind Friends
who are for ever out of Humour with those whom they rather enthrall than
oblige, by giving them that Name. As a Proof I never wish to act so by my
Friends, or am afraid of being treated so by them, I will own to you, I am
not quite sure, I should have answered your last Let∣ter so soon,
were it not that I am under se∣rious Concern to find how aukwardly I must
have expressed myself to Mr. SHENSTONE, if I gave him Room to believe, I
harboured a secret Wish to have so fine a Poem as his Ode 
<PB N="296" REF="314"/> suppressed. On the contrary, I should think
myself guilty of a very great Crime and In∣justice to the Public, if I were
to be the Means of depriving them of so charming and rational an
Entertainment. I gave him the true Rea∣sons in my Letter, for desiring that
my own Name, nor that of my humble yet peace∣ful Dwelling, might be inserted.
You know I always envied the Lot of 
<Q REND="inline">"<HI>La Vislette, qui se cache sous
l'Herbe.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>'Tis true, my dear Lady LUXBOROUGH, Times are changed with us,
since no Walk was long enough, or Exercise painful enough to hurt us, as we
childishly imagined; yet after a Ball or Masquerade, have we not come Home
very well contented to pull off our Ornaments and fine Cloaths, in order to go
to rest? Such methinks is the Reception we naturally give to the Warnings of
our bodily Decays; they seem to undress us by Degrees, to prepare us for a
Rest that will refresh us far more power∣fully than any Night's Sleep could
do. We shall then find no Weariness from the Fatigues which either our
Bodies or our Minds have under∣gone; but all Tears shall be wiped from our 
<PB N="297" REF="315"/> Eyes, and Sorrow, and Crying, and Pains, shall be no
more; we shall then without Weariness move in our new Vehicles, transport
ourselves from one Part of the Skies to another, with much more Ease and
Velocity, than we could have done in the Prime of our Strength, upon the
fleetest Horses, the Distance of a Mile. This chearful Prospect enables
us to see our Strength fail, and await the Tokens of our approaching
Dissolution with a Kind of awful Pleasure. I will ingenuously own to
you, dear Madam, that I experience more true Happiness in the retired Manner
of Life that I have embraced, than I ever knew from all the Splen∣dour or
Flatteries of the World. There was always a Void: they could not satisfy a
rational Mind: and at the most heedless Time of my Youth, I well remember,
that I always looked forward, with a Kind of Joy, to a de∣cent Retreat, when
the Evening of Life should make it practicable.</P>
<P><HI>Boadicea</HI> I have read—there is an interesting Scene
or two in it; but there is something wanting in the Management of the Drama
to keep up the Spirits of the Audience. <HI>Philo∣clea</HI> 
<PB N="298" REF="316"/> I have not seen, nor have heard such a Cha∣racter of
it, as to raise my Curiosity. If you have not read <HI>Deformity,</HI> an
Essay, by Mr. HAY, nor his <HI>Religio Philosophi</HI> (I don't know how
that last Word should end) I believe they will entertain you very well in
their different Ways. The <HI>Adventurer</HI> will soon be published in
Volumes, and will be very well worth buy∣ing. I doubt I must agree with Mr.
SHEN∣STONE, that the Stile of <HI>Sir Charles Grandison</HI> is too prolix,
and yet I don't know any of it I should be willing to part with, except
<HI>Harriot Byron</HI>'s Conversation with the <HI>Oxonian,</HI> in the
first Volume, and the Preparations and Entertainments at Sir
<HI>Charles</HI>'s Wedding, in the fifth.</P>
<P>When I came home from taking the Air on <HI>Friday,</HI> I was very
agreeably surprised to find Lady NORTHUMBERLAND ready to receive me, as I
had no Notion of her coming. She had been alarmed with a false Report, that I
had not been so well for some days as she left me. I took the Opportunity
of shewing her your Letter, and she desired me to make her Com∣pliments
to your Ladyship, and tell you, she <PB N="299" REF="317"/> keeps no Servant
about Lady ELIZABETH, while she is at School, and at her Return will think it
necessary to have a Person of a middle Age about her. Such a one she
now has about her little Boy; a pretty Sort of Woman, who speaks
<HI>French</HI> and <HI>English</HI> equally well, is grave and properly
behaved, and, I believe, hopes for Lady ELIZABETH's Place, when her little
An∣gel of a Master goes into the Hands of the Men. His Mamma took him away
with her on <HI>Saturday,</HI> after lending him to me for a Month (though
she is excessively fond of him) because she sees he is the Joy of
my Life. He has some faint Resemblance (though not a good one) of his poor
Uncle; but his Open∣ness and Mildness of Temper are the very same. Her
eldest Boy too, is a very sensible and good one. He and Lady GREVILLE
dine with me from <HI>Eaton</HI> every <HI>Sunday</HI>; they are here at
present for two or three Days, on Account of their being Hollidays. I have
hardly left my∣self Room to make Mr. COWSLAD's Compli∣ments, and

<HEAD>LETTER LXXIII. Mr. DODSLEY to W. SHENSTONE, Esq.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>Jan.</HI> 5, 1761.</DATE></DATELINE> 
<SALUTE>Dear Mr. SHENSTONE,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM very glad, that with the Return of Spring, your Strength and
Spirits begin also to revive. May they proceed and encrease with the
Season, and communicate such Health and Vigour to your vernal Shoots, as
will en∣courage and enable them to bud, blossom, and bear; for 'tis Pity,
that Fruit of so exquisite a Fla∣vour should be lost to the Taste of
Mankind! But your Generosity and Benevolence lead you to cultivate and
improve the barren Soil and sorry Shrubs of your Friends, to the Neglect of
your own rich Fields and more excellent Plantations. You will see in the
<HI>Critical Review</HI> a Character of my Fables sufficient to make me
excessively proud, were I not inwardly checked by consi∣dering how much
they owe to your Correc∣tion: but I ought to be proud of that, and I am so.
They do not, however, yet appear <PB N="301" REF="319"/> to be much taken Notice
of; but it is early Days, and my Friends encourage me to hope, that when they
are known, they will not be neglected. I am much pleased with the fur∣ther
Honour you have done them, in getting new Head and Tail Pieces executed, and
shall be very impatient till I see your List of the Subjects.</P>
<P>As to your Picture, you may be sure I long to receive it, as it
will at once adorn my Room, and do Honour to myself; and I think farther,
that as it will, probably not be much mended by Alteration, the best Way will
be to send it up without Delay: but this, how∣ever, I leave intirely to your
Determination.</P>
<P>I have applied to Mr. RICH, in Behalf of Mr. HERON; but he has no
Vacancy in his House, nor Room to employ him: as to Mr. GARRICK, I am not on
such Terms, at pre∣sent, as to ask a Favour of him. I have spo∣ken
also to two or three Printers about Mr. W—, but I have not yet been
able to hear of any Thing for him—but I will not <PB N="302" REF="320"/>
give it up: I shall be glad to know what Pay he will expect.</P>
<P>Mr. JENNYNS's Book will be published in about a
Fortnight—When Mr. PERCY's will be ready is uncertain. All your Letters
are very acceptable to me, as they assure me of your Friendship;
therefore, pray write to me as often as you can, though you should have
nothing more to say, than to give me that As∣surance.</P>

<SALUTE>Dear Mr. DODSLEY,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE spoken to Mr. L— upon the Sub∣ject of his Dedication;
and he agrees with me, that there can be no properer Person to procure the
Leave we want than Mr. D—. Suppress, therefore, if you please, my
Letter to Mr. L—, and engage Mr. D— as soon as ever you can, to
do his best Offices in this Affair. They wait only for the Plates, and my
Lord's Answer, before they can order his Arms to be engraved. I blundered, in
regard to L—'s University; a Blunder so much the more unlucky, as
they have no Masters of Arts at <HI>Edinburgh:</HI> he was of
<HI>Aberdeen.</HI> As to the rest, you will give Mr. D— any pro∣per
Information my Letter affords you. L— does not expect a Present; he
will be perfectly satisfied if the Work entitle him to any Degree of Lord
B—'s esteem: and this Mr. D— may <PB N="304" REF="322"/>
<HI>say,</HI> should his Lordship give him an Oppor∣tunity. Perhaps it
need not be mentioned, that L— is a <HI>Scotchman,</HI> unless my Lord
should make particular Enquiry. Betwixt Friends, I believe, that having no
Establishment, he means here∣after to ask some little Matter, by Means
of a <HI>Scotch</HI> Lady, who is my Lord's Relation.</P>
<P>The smaller Drawing you enclosed is really a perfect Beauty, and
must be executed at all Events when I return it, which I mean to do on
<HI>Saturday</HI>; I shall give the Engraver one or two Directions.</P>
<P>I wish I could think as highly of the Fron∣tispiece. In Truth,
it does not please me; and what to do, I cannot tell. The Designer does not
seem to enter into the Spirit of the Story; and the Circumstance of the
Shield hung upon the Pillar, (a single Pillar of the Temple had been
sufficient) with the Motto being wholly omitted, throws the whole Stress
upon the Me∣rit of the two Figures in the fore Ground. I am sorry to say,
these do not answer, MAE∣CENAS appears with no Dignity, and HORACE's
Attitude I can't explain. If the Floor had <PB N="305" REF="323"/> been raised
one Step where the Patron sits, and his Person tall, or his Chair
embellished a little, &amp;c. and if HORACE were shorter, (as his Nature
was) his Attitude no Way vio∣lent, and his Head down-cast, it would,
per∣haps, have removed some of my Objections. But if there were no
Possibility of hanging a Shield, &amp;c. on a Piece of a Temple, and so
making the Back-Ground important, (as the Designer surely might have done)
yet there evidently were Means of rendering it more beautiful than it appears
here. HAYMAN cer∣tainly should have been the Man! But more of this when I
write on <HI>Saturday.</HI></P>
<P>When shall I see <HI>Baptista Porta?</HI> As also the
Frontispiece only to the Ornaments, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of Temples and Churches?
The Verses in the <HI>London Magazine</HI> are tolerably well printed, though
my Punctuation is not observed. Your Brother was to send me also the
<HI>Annual Re∣gisters</HI>; all, except that for the Year 1759. I believe
W— has or will desire your Bro∣they to supply him with the few
Magazines he distributes here. This Letter is written amid much Hurry and
Confusion of Brain, <PB N="306" REF="324"/> when I can really express
nothing to my Mind, much less the Esteem and Affection with which I am,</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR very obliging Letter gave me great Pleasure; pardon my Delay
in not re∣turning my Thanks for that Favour sooner; I waited to have offered
my small Collection to your View at the same Time, which Dr. W—
gen∣teely excused himself from the Trouble of pe∣rusing, professing
he had not Leisure or critical Skill enough to be of Service to the
Work.—<PB N="307" REF="325"/> When my Brother received my Papers at
<HI>Bir∣mingham,</HI> he shewed them to Dr. H—, who obligingly asked
Leave to shew them to Lord LYTTELTON, which you will imagine was too
agreeable an Offer not to be accepted: the Doctor took them to <HI>Hagley,</HI>
about a Fort∣night since, to be transmitted to his Lordship by Admiral
SMITH. As soon as I receive them, I shall immediately do myself the
Plea∣sure of sending them to the <HI>Leasowes.</HI></P>
<P>To Mr. — I find myself indebted for the Publication of my
Verses to Miss L—, of which, and my Letter to her, she had given
him Copies. I received the first Intimation of that Affair from you, but
soon after saw the same incorrect Copy, together with his ab∣surd and
disadvantageous Account of me, in two different Magazines. I wrote to him
up∣on that Subject; he promised to retract what he had asserted upon
Misinformation; but his Letters and Behaviour did not appear quite equal to
the amiable Idea I had conceived of him. I am informed by a Friend in Town,
that the same Person has sent up a handsome Apo∣logy, to be inserted
in the <HI>Gentleman's Maga∣zine,</HI> <PB N="308" REF="326"/> for
<HI>February,</HI> which (as if it were intended purely for the Satisfaction of
the Public, and not to do Justice to an injured Person) he did not
condescend to honour me with the Peru∣sal of.</P>
<P>I am extremely obliged to you for the Trou∣ble you took in sending
a correct Copy of those Verses to the <HI>London Magazine,</HI> which I
saw with much Satisfaction. I am also to acknowledge the Favour of your
friendly Advice, in Regard to Mr. W—'s Papers; what you say on that
Head gives me great Pleasure, as it intirely coincides with my own
Sentiments: I had no Thoughts of inserting those Papers in my Collection,
but looked up∣on them as Things of a private Nature, in∣tended only for the
Amusement of ourselves.</P>
<P>When last I saw that Gentleman, he men∣tioned my adding those
to the Number I in∣tended to print; had I directly objected to it, I had some
Reason to think it would disgust him: he mentioned referring it to you,
which I agreed to with Pleasure, resolving to give it a fair Chance, not
doubting but your Judgment <PB N="309" REF="327"/> and Delicacy would
disapprove of such an Ad∣dition to my little Volume: (that is to be.) I
have not yet wrote to Mr. W—, but shall take an early Opportunity of
letting him know your Opinion, which cannot (I think) be any Diminution of the
Pleasure he may take in his Composition, as it is only the Subject which
denies it a Place in my Collection.</P>

<SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is not in my Power to express the grate∣ful Sense of the
Obligations I owe you, for your most agreeable Letter, and for those
valuable Pieces which accompanied it, and your other Favours. I am
sensible, that so late a Return to such repeated Marks of Goodness,
carries with it Appearances against me; but as I am convinced, your
Good-nature cannot in∣terpret any Thing harshly, I hold it as almost
unnecessary to assure you, that Neglect was not the Cause of my
Silence; that, indeed, would have been a Fault for which I could not have
forgiven myself, far less could I have asked Forgiveness of you; the
Hurry of Bu∣siness, during the Winter Sessions, is the only Excuse I
shall plead in my Defence, which but too effectually deprived me of the
Pleasure of corresponding with my Friends, and cut me off from all
Communication with Elegance or the fine Arts—and of late, an Inflammation
in my <PB N="311" REF="329"/> Eyes has much distressed me, which at
present gives the more Pain, as it prevents me from the Satisfaction of
writing so fully as I in∣tended, and from giving you any Remarks on those
Pearls you was so good as to send me; the chief Intention of this is to
assure you, that I have not been unmindful of your Friend Mr. PERCY,
whose Design I much approve of, and the more especially, as he has given
you a rejecting Power. Please to let him know that I have written to my
Friends every where, to pick up all the Ballads they can, while I am
searching every Part in Town, where I sus∣pect any Thing may be found
worthy of Pub∣lication. In a short Time I hope to have it in my Power to
transmit you some Pieces which will merit a Place in his Collection.</P>
<P>Although it is not without some Difficulty that I now write, yet I
cannot leave off with∣out letting you know, how much I was de∣lighted with your
excellent Verses, intended for the Pedestal of <HI>Venus de
Medicis:</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"> 
<Q REND="inline">"To VENUS, VENUS here retir'd,"
<HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q> See the last Composition, in the Description of the
<HI>Leasowes,</HI> SHEN∣STONE<HI>'s Works.</HI></NOTE> but all the Encomiums
that I can give them (or your <PB N="312" REF="330"/> other Compositions) fall
infinitely short of their real Value. The Thoughts are fine, and rise
naturally from the Subject; the three first Stanzas shew, indeed, the Hand
of a Master, nor do I remember any Thing of Antiquity superior to them for
Elegance and Simplicity of Versification, Justness of Sentiment, or
Beau∣ty of Allusion; nothing can be more happily imagined, than the
Opposition of your bash∣ful Beauty to the <HI>Paphian</HI> and
<HI>Phrygian</HI> God∣dess, while the Choice of Words does Ho∣nour to the
Truth and Beauty of the Senti∣ment. The seventh is charming, and the Epi∣thet
<HI>Meretricious</HI> conveys so striking a Descrip∣tion of false
Taste, and is so well adapted to the fulsome carving and gilding of
<HI>Chinese</HI> Baubles, that he must be dull indeed who is not struck
by it. It irks me, that I am obliged to defer taking Notice of the other Pieces
till another Time.</P>
<P>I had lately the Pleasure of a Visit from your Friend Mr.
COOKES, whose Connection with you I wish I had known sooner. I shall
take the first Opportunity of sending you the Anandale Bronze Earth he
mentioned. In the <PB N="313" REF="331"/> mean Time, I have sent you a little
Provi∣sion of the best <HI>Preston-Pans</HI> Snuff, both toasted and
untoasted, in four Bottles, with one Bot∣tle of Highland Snishon, and four
Bottle Bon∣nets, all packed in a Box, along with some Things for our worthy
Friend Dr. ROEBUCK, at <HI>Birmingham,</HI> which I hope you will accept of, as
a small Stimulus to our Friendship. Please to let me know, which Sort is
most agreeable, that I may send you a fresh Sup∣ply in due Time.</P>
<P>The good Lord ALEMOOR is just now getting the better of a tedious
Fit of the Gout; he returns you his kindest Respects, and bids me
assure you in the strongest Manner, of his most cordial Esteem,
that he would be happy to hear from you, but much more to see you in this
Corner of the World. Professor SMITH, DOUGLAS, HUME, Dr. ROBERTSON, (now
Prin∣cipal of our University here) and many other of your Friends, desire
me to return you their Compliments centuplicated. Allow me a small Share in
your Friendship, and believe that I am, with the utmost Esteem, dear
Sir,</P>

<HEAD>LETTER LXXVII. Mr. DODSLEY to W. SHENSTONE, Esq.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>Sept.</HI> 18, 1761.</DATE></DATELINE> 
<SALUTE>Dear Mr. SHENSTONE,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AFTER I parted from you at <HI>Broomsgrove,</HI> I arrived very
safe and speedily at <HI>Wor∣cester,</HI> as I hope you did at the
<HI>Leasowes.</HI> I found Dr. D— in the same infirm State of Health,
in which he has lingered for some Years past; but by keeping up his Spirits
and his Appetite, by great Temperance, and by taking an Airing regularly twice
a Day in his Chaise, for six or eight Miles at a Time, he has so nicely
trimmed his feeble Lamp of Life, that he has prevented it from going out, and
may possibly preserve it burning some few Years longer. I employed Mrs.
D— to get me a Pot of Lampreys, which I sent, Carriage paid, to be left
for you at Mr. HODGETT's: I hope you received them safe, and that they proved
good.</P>
<P><PB N="315" REF="333"/>On the <HI>Monday</HI> following, I went from
<HI>Wor∣cester,</HI> in the <HI>Birmingham</HI> Stage, to <HI>Bristol,</HI>
and the next Morning in a Post-Chaise to <HI>Bath.</HI> I found a Letter at
LEAKE's, which had lain for me eight or ten Days, and the Morning after my
Arrival received another, both ear∣nestly pressing my Return; I set out
again, therefore, in two or three Days for <HI>London,</HI> where, without the
least Fatigue, on <HI>Tuesday</HI> last I arrived. If I can be of any
Service to the Widow, I shall be very glad; but I am afraid the Father is
inclined to take every Advantage which the Law will allow him.</P>
<P>At <HI>Bath,</HI> I saw Mr. MELMOTH, who arrived there with his
Lady the Day before I set out. He laments very much his Misfortune in
mis∣sing you at the <HI>Leasowes:</HI> but hopes he shall have the
Pleasure of seeing you some Time or other at <HI>Bath,</HI> where for the
future (ex∣cept two or three Months in the Winter, which he will dedicate to
his Friends in <HI>London</HI>) he intends to reside. I spent a Day with
Mr. W—, who is meditating an Essay on <HI>Simplicity,</HI> of which
he shewed me an imperfect Plan, and <PB N="316" REF="334"/> some few
Sketches of the Work; he considers it in Sentiments, Language, Actions, and
Works of Art, and I fancy will make a good Performance of it. I spent also
a Day with Mr. GRAVES. Mr. ALLEN has built him a good additional Room, and a
handsome School. He is very earnest in his Wishes, that you would
pursue your Subscription without farther Delay, and desires that I will
press you to it without In∣termission; I told him, I had said all I
could, and hoped you would proceed. You are in the Meridian of your Fame, he
says, and should not let your Sun decline one Moment, before you put your
Work in Agitation.</P>
<CLOSER>
<SIGNED>I am, dear Sir, with great Truth, affectionately yours, R.
DODSLEY.</SIGNED></CLOSER>

<HEAD>LETTER LXXVIII. Mr. T. L— to W. SHENSTONE, Esq.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Northfield,</HI> 
<DATE><HI>Oct.</HI> 18, 1761.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>THAT the Polite must ever please equally in the Matter and
Manner is what I am not now to learn, having had convincing Proof of it, ever
since I have had the pleasing Ho∣nour of being known to Mr. SHENSTONE. To
comprehend in a Nut-Shell a Volume of Ideas, is the happy Talent of a
superior Genius, which those of the more minute, at a Distance, admire,
but cannot attain; at least, in our dull Pro∣fession, the Difficulties
attending such an At∣tempt are almost insuperable. It can't have
escaped so penetrating an Observation as Mr. SHENSTONE's, that bad Men
examine every Law with no other Intention than to reap the Benefits, and at the
same Time to evade the equal Contributions intended to be levied from all
those, who, as they enjoy the Benefits, ought in Reason to contribute their
just Pro∣portions of the Expences incurred by those, <PB N="318" REF="336"/>
to whom they are indebted for those Advan∣tages. Against such artful and
mischievous Examiners, it is the Duty of those of our dull Profession
to be upon our Guard, and to protect, by all the Vigilance we are able, the
honest and well-meaning from the Artifices and Designs of the dishonest
and ungenerous. Few Words, alas! however significcant, are not able to effect
such a Security; and though Dullness has been the unfortunate Cause of
in∣troducing a Multiplicity of useless Tautology in many legal
Transactions, yet the necessary Cau∣tions, requisite to protect the
undesigning from the Dangers of Fraud, from those who are the Pests of
Society, have unhappily made some Repetitions necessary in many Cases,
where a liberal Interpretation, and Elegance of Expres∣sion would point
them out as unnecessary, and place them in a ridiculous, and, indeed,
con∣temptible Light, in the Judgment of a liberal and generous Observer,
unacquainted with the hackneyed Ways of bad and designing Men. But, alas!
Such Men there are—such must be guarded against; and to aid me in
such an <HI>Herculean</HI> Labour, to unite Force, and intro∣duce, at the
same Time, Dignity of Expression <PB N="319" REF="337"/> and Elegance,
instead of dull Form, I took the Liberty of requesting the Aid of a
<HI>Pen-Shenstonian!</HI> I return my very sincere Thanks for the kind
Assistance you have been so good as to give me; and, as far as the
Cautions I am obliged to observe, in order to guard against the
Inconveniences I have before hinted at, will permit me, shall profit by them;
and as I foresee many Difficulties that may be likely to arise before the
Benefits we wish for from the intended Act may be brought to Perfection, I
shall take the Liberty you so obligingly per∣mit me, of desiring the
Assistance and Honour of your Advice, where I have Occasion for it.</P>
<P>If I was much susceptible of Vanity, I should have ample Food
for it in indulging the Belief you flatter me with, that a Corre∣spondence
from — could give you any Pleasure or Entertainment: but I am not yet
so vain—Plain Facts, and plain Truth and Since∣rity, are all that I can
aim at in a Corre∣spondence; nor can I think, that simple Nar∣ratives,
unaided with any Embellishments of Genius, or Liveliness of Fancy, can give
Plea∣sure to a Mind so stored with brilliant Ideas <PB N="320" REF="338"/>
as Mr. SHENSTONE's; yet permit me to as∣sure you, if you honour me with any
Com∣mands, I shall take a very sincere Pleasure in obeying them.</P>
<P>You have much damped the pleasing Ex∣pectations I had formed of
seeing you in — but I yet can't help indulging an Hope, that we yet
may, by some happy Event that may deserve your Attention there, be
gratified with that Pleasure the ensuing Winter. But wherever you are,
permit me very sincerely to wish you every Felicity, and to join in a
par∣ticular Assurance, with the general Assurances which I am desired
to add from all this Fa∣mily, that they are, as I am,</P>
<CLOSER>
<SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE> 
<SIGNED>your faithful and obedient Servant, T.
