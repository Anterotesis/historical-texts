<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>MONG the several degrees of authors, there are none perhaps,
who have more obstacles to surmount at their setting out, than the
writers of periodical essays. Talk with a modern critic, and he will tell
you, that to set up a new paper is a vain attempt after the inimitable
SPECTATORS and others; that the subjects are already pre∣occupied, and that
it is equally impossible to find out a new field for observation, as to
discover a new world. With these prejudices the public are prepared to
receive us; and while they expect to be cloyed with the stale repetition of
the same fare, though tossed up in a different manner, they have but
little relish for the entertainment.</P>
<P><PB N="422" REF="3"/>THAT the SPECTATOR first led the way,
must undoubt∣edly be acknowledged: but that his followers must for that
reason be always supposed to tread in his steps, can by no means be
allowed. In the high road of life there are several extensive walks, as
well as bye-paths, which we may strike into, without the necessity of
keeping the same beaten track with those that have gone before us. New
objects for ridicule will continually present themselves; and even the
same characters will appear different by being differently disposed, as
in the same pack of cards, though ever so often shuffled, there will
never be two hands exactly alike.</P>
<P>AFTER this introduction I hope to be pardoned, if I in∣dulge
myself in speaking a word or two concerning my own endeavours to entertain
the public; which I imagine I could never do with so good a grace, as at the
beginning of my second volume. And first, whatever objections the reader
may have had to the subjects of my papers, I shall make no apology for the
manner in which I have chose to treat them. The dread of falling into (what
they are pleased to call) colloquial barbarisms has induced some
unskilful writers to swell their bloated diction with uncouth phrases and
the affected jargon of pedants. For my own part, I never go out of the common
way of expression, merely for the sake of introducing a more sounding
word with a <HI>Latin</HI> termination. The <HI>English</HI> language is
sufficiently co∣pious and expressive without any further adoption of new
terms; and the native words seem to me to have far more force than any
foreign auxiliaries, however pompously ushered in: as <HI>British</HI>
soldiers fight our battles better than the troops taken into our pay.</P>
<P><PB N="423" REF="4"/>THE subjects of my essays have been
chiefly such, as I thought might recommend themselves to the public notice
by being new and uncommon. For this reason I purposely avoided the worn out
practice of retailing scraps of mora∣lity, and affecting to dogmatize on the
common duties of life. In this point, indeed, the SPECTATOR is inimitable; nor
could I hope to say any thing new upon these topics after so many
excellent moral and religious essays, which, are the principal ornament of
his work. I have therefore contented myself with exposing vice and folly by
painting the actors in their natural colours, without assuming the
rigidness of a preacher, or the moroseness of a philosopher. I have
oftener chose to undermine our fashionable excesses by secret
sapping, than to storm them by open assaults. In a word, upon all
occasions I have endeavoured to laugh peo∣ple into a better behaviour; as I
am convinced, that the sting of reproof is not less sharp for being
concealed; and advice never comes with a better face, than when it comes with a
laughing one.</P>
<P>THERE are some points in the course of this work, which
perhaps might have been treated of with a more serious air. I have thought it
my duty to take every opportunity of ex∣posing the absurd tenets of our
modern free-thinkers and enthusiasts. The enthusiast is, indeed, much
more difficult to cure than the free-thinker; because the latter, with all
his bravery, cannot but be conscious that he is wrong; whereas the former has
perhaps deceived himself into a be∣lief, that he is certainly in the right,
and the more he is op∣posed, the more he considers himself as 
<Q REND="inline">"patiently suffer∣ing for the truth's
sake."</Q> Ignorance is too stubborn to yield to conviction; and on the
other hand those, whom <PB N="424" REF="5"/> 
<Q REND="inline">"a little learning has made mad,"</Q> are too
proud and self∣sufficient to hearken to the sober voice of reason. The
only way left us, therefore, is to root out superstition, by making its
followers ashamed of themselves: and as for our free-thinkers, it is but
right to turn their boasted weapons of ridicule against them; and as they
them∣selves endeavour to banter all others out of their serious and
virtuous notions, we too (in the language of the Psalmist) should 
<Q REND="inline">"laugh them to scorn, and have them in
derision."</Q></P>
<P>BUT whatever merit I may assume to myself from my
writings, I must at the same time confess myself indebted to several
correspondents for many excellent pieces; and more particularly to the
gentlemen, who have signed themselves A. B. and G. K. As I know not the
real names of any of my correspondents, I am not without some hopes, that I
have been honoured by an Earl or a Right Honourable at least: for to say
the truth, I cannot at present apply to myself the known boast of
<HI>Terence,</HI> 
<Q> 
<L>—Homines nobiles</L> 
<L>Eum adjutare, assiduèque unà
scribere.</L></Q></P>
<P>IT is with infinite pleasure, that I find myself so much
encouraged to continue my labours, by the kind reception which they have
hitherto met with from the public: and Mr. <HI>Baldwin</HI> with no less
pleasure informs me, that as there are but few numbers left of the present
edition, he intends to collect them into Two Pocket Volumes. The reader cannot
conceive, how much I already pride myself on the charming figure, which my
works will make in this new <PB N="425" REF="6"/> form: and I shall endeavour
to render these volumes as complete as I possibly can, by several
considerable additions and amendments. Though contracted into the small
space of a twelves volume, I still hope to maintain my former dignity; like
the Devils in <HI>Milton's Pandaemonium,</HI> who, 
<Q> 
<L>—To smallest forms</L> 
<L>Reduc'd their shapes immense, and were at
large.</L></Q></P>
<P>THE SPECTATOR has very elegantly compared his single papers,
as they came out, to 
<Q REND="inline">"cherries on a stick,"</Q> of the dearness
of which the purchasers cannot complain, who are willing to gratify their
taste with choice fruit at its earliest production. I have considered my
own papers as so many flowers, which joined together would make up a pretty
nosegay; and though each of them, singly taken, may not be equally admired
for their odours, they may receive an additional fragrance by an happy union of
their sweets.</P>
<P>CUSTOM hath lately introduced a new fashion among
essay-writers, of giving translations of the mottos for the benefit of
the ladies. But (as <HI>Denham</HI> has remarked of translation in general) 
<Q REND="inline">"the spirit of the original is evapo∣rated in
the transfusion, and nothing is left behind but a mere <HI>caput
mortuum.</HI>"</Q> Translations, however, must be given; and it has been
the usual way to copy them pro∣miscuously from <HI>Dryden</HI> or
<HI>Francis:</HI> though they are gene∣rally very wide of the intended
sense of the original, and not unfrequently nothing to the purpose. For
this reason I de∣sign to give new translations, or rather imitations, of
all the mottos and quotations, adapted to the present times. Some of these
will admit of epigrammatic turns; and many of <PB N="426" REF="7"/> them will
afford room for lively and picturesque allu∣sions to modern manners. In
this dress they will at least appear more of a piece with the essays
themselves; and not like the patch-work of random translations.</P>
<P>IN the mean time, I shall only add, that if any Noble∣man,
Gentleman, or Rich Citizen, is ambitious to have his name prefixed to either of
these volumes, he is desired to send in proposals, together with a
list of his virtues and good qualities, to the publisher; and the
Dedications shall be disposed of to the best bidder.</P>
<P>{inverted ⁂}None but principals will be treated with.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE managers of our Public Gardens, willing to make their
summer diversions as com∣plete as possible, are not content with laying
out beautiful walks, and providing an excel∣lent band of music, but are
also at much expence to amuse us with the old <HI>English</HI>
entertainment of Ballad-singing. For this end they not only retain the best
voices that can be procured, but each of them also has a poet in ordinary,
who is allowed a stated salary, and the run of the Gardens. The productions
of these petty lau∣reats naturally come within my notice as CRITIC; and,
indeed, whether I am at <HI>Vauxhall, Ranelagh, Marybone,</HI> or even
<HI>Sadler's Wells,</HI> I indulge myself in many remarks on the poetry of
the place; and am as attentive to the songs as to the Cascade, the
Fireworks, or Miss <HI>Isabella Wilkinson.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="428" REF="9"/>BALLADS seem peculiarly adapted to the
genius of our people; and are a species of composition, in which we are
superior to all other nations. Many of our old <HI>English</HI> Songs have
in them an affecting simplicity; and it is re∣markable, that our best
writers have not been ashamed to cultivate this branch of poetry. <HI>Cowley,
Waller; Rofcommon, Rowe, Gay, Prior,</HI> and many others, have left behind
them very elegant Ballads; but it must be confessed, to the honour of the
present age, that it was reserved for our modern writers to bring this kind
of poetry to perfection. Song-writing is now reduced to certain rules of art,
and the Ballad-maker goes to work by a method as regular and me∣chanical, as a
carpenter or a blacksmith.</P>
<P>SWIFT, in his "Voyage to <HI>Laputa,</HI>" describes a
ma∣chine to write books in all arts and sciences: I have also read of a
mill to make verses; and remember to have seen a curious table, by the
assistance of which the most illiterate might amuse themselves in
composing hexameters and pentameters in <HI>Latin:</HI> Inventions
wonderfully calculated for the promotion of literature. Whatever gentlemen of
<HI>Grub-street</HI> or others are ambitious to inlist themselves as
hackney sonetteers, are desired to attend to the following rules, drawn
from the practice of our modern song-writers: a set of geniusses
excellent in their manner, and who will probably be hereafter as much known and
admired as Garden-Poets, as the celebrated <HI>Taylor</HI> is now famous under
the denomination of Water-Poet.</P>
<P>I MUST beg leave possitively to contradict any reports,
insinuating that our Ballad-makers are in possession of such a
machine, mill, or table as above-mentioned; and believe <PB N="429" REF="10"/>
it to be equally false, that it is their practice to hustle certain quaint
terms and phrases together in a hat, and take them out at random. It has,
indeed, been asserted on some just ground, that their productions are
totally void of sense and expression, that they have little rhyme and
less reason, and that they are from beginning to end nothing more than
nonsensical rhapsodies to a new tune. This charge I do not mean to deny:
though I cannot but lament the deplorable want of taste, that mentions it as
a fault. For it is this very circumstance, which I, who am professedly a
CONNOISSEUR, particularly admire. It is a received maxim with all composers
of music, that nothing is so melodious as nonsense. Manly sense is
too harsh and stubborn to go through the numberless divisions and
sub∣divisions of modern music, and to be trilled forth in crotchets and
demiquavers. For this reason, thought is so cautiously sprinkled over a
modern song; which it is the business of the singer to warble into
harmony and sentiment.</P>
<P>OUR Ballad-makers for the most part slide into the familiar
stile, and affect that easy manner of writing, which (accord∣ing to
<HI>Wycherley)</HI> is easily written. Seeing the dangerous consequence of
meaning, in words adapted to music, they are very frugal of sentiment: and
indeed they husband it so well, that the same thoughts are adapted to
every song. The only variation requisite in twenty ballads is, that the
last line of the stanza be different. In this ingenious line the wit of the
whole song consists; and the author, whether <HI>he shall die if he has
not the lass of the mill,</HI> or <HI>deserves to be reckon'd an
ass,</HI> turns over his dictionary of rhymes for words of a similar
sound, and every verse jingles to the same word <PB N="430" REF="11"/>
with all the agreeable variety of a set of bells eternally ring∣ing the
same peal.</P>
<P>THE authors of love-songs formerly wasted a great deal of
poetry in illustrating their own passion and the beauty of their
mistress; but our modern poets content themselves with falling in love
with her name. There cannot be a greater misfortune to one of these rhymers
than a mistress with a hard name; such a misfortune sends them all over
the world and makes them run through all arts, sciences, and languages for
correspondent terms: and after all per∣haps the name is so harsh and
untractable, that our poet has as much difficulty to bring it into verse, as
the cele∣braters of the Duke of <HI>Marlborough</HI> were puzzled to reduce to
rhyme the uncouth names of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Towns taken in Queen
<HI>Anne</HI>'s wars. <HI>Valentine</HI> in <HI>Love for Love,</HI> when he
talks of turning poet, orders <HI>Jeremy</HI> to get the maids together of an
evening to Crambo: no contemptible hint to our Ballad∣makers, and which, if
properly made use of, would be of as much service to them as <HI>Byshe's
Art of Poetry.</HI></P>
<P>FEARING lest this method of song-writing should one day
grow obsolete, in order to preserve to posterity some idea of it, I
have put together the following dialogue as a specimen of the modern manner.
I must, however, be in∣genuous enough to confess, that I can claim no
farther me∣rit in this elegant piece than that of a compiler. It is a Canto
from our most celebrated new songs; from which I have carefully culled all
the sweetest flowers of poetry, and bound them up together for the delight
and wonder of the world. As all the lines are taken from different songs
set to different tunes, I would humbly propose that this curious 
<PB N="431" REF="12"/> performance should be sung jointly by all the best
voices, in the manner of a <HI>Dutch</HI> concert, where every man sings his
own tune. I had once some thoughts of affixing mar∣ginal references to each
line, to inform the reader by note at what place the song whence it is taken
was first sung. But I shall spare myself that trouble by desiring
the reader to look on the whole piece as arising from a coalition of our
most eminent song-writers at <HI>Vauxhall, Ranelagh, Mary∣bone,</HI> and
<HI>Sadler's Wells:</HI> assuring him, that this short dia∣logue contains
the pith and marrow, or rather (to borrow an expression from the Fine Lady
in <HI>Lethe)</HI> the <HI>Quinsetence</HI> and <HI>Emptity</HI> of all our
modern songs.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="body of issue">
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">W</SEG>ALKING the other, day in <HI>Westminster</HI> Abbey, among
the many oftentatious monu∣ments erected to kings and warriors, I could not
help observing a little stone, on which was this pompous
inscription—<HI>Aeternae Memoriae Sacrum</HI>—Sacred to the
Eternal Memory of —. The name of the person, to whom immortality was
thus secured, is almost obliterated; and perhaps, when alive, he was little
known, and as soon forgot by the small circle of his friends and
acquaintance.</P>
<P>I HAVE been used to look upon epitaphs as a kind of flattering
dedications to the dead; in which is set down a long catalogue of virtues,
(that nobody knew they were <PB N="434" REF="15"/> possessed of while
living) and not a word of their vices or follies. The veracity of these
posthumous encomiums may, indeed, be fairly suspected, as we are
generally told, that the disconsolate widow, or weeping son, erected the
monu∣ment in testimony of their affliction for the loss of the kind∣est
husband, or most affectionate father. But what dowager, who gets a
comfortable jointure by her good man's decease, would refuse to set her
hand to it on his tomb-stone, that he was the best of husbands; though
perhaps they had parted beds? or what heir would be so base and ungrateful,
as not to give a few good words to a crabbed parent after his death, in return,
for his estate?</P>
<P>BY the extravagant praises, which are indiscriminately
lavished on the ashes of every person alike, we entirely pervert the
original intent of epitaphs, which were contrived to do honour and justice to
the virtuous and the good: But by the present practice the reputations of men
are equally con∣founded with their dust in the grave, where there is no
dis∣tinction between the good and the bad. The law has ap∣pointed searchers
to enquire, when any one dies, into the cause of his death: in the same
manner I could wish, that searchers were appointed to examine into his way
of living, before a character be given of him upon the tomb-stone.</P>
<P>THE flatteries, that are paid to the deceased, are
un∣doubtedly owing to the pride of their survivors, which is the same among
the lowest as the highest set of people. When an obscure grocer or
tallow-chandler dies at his lodg∣ings at <HI>Islington,</HI> the news-papers
are stuffed with the same parade of his virtues and good qualities, as when
a duke, goes out of the world: and the petty overseer of a little 
<PB N="435" REF="16"/> hamlet has a painted board with the initials of his name
stuck up at the end of his wicker'd turf, while the noblemen reposes under
a grand mausoleum erected to his memory, with a long list of his titles and
heroic deeds.</P>
<P>THE Great, indeed, have found means to separate them∣selves
even in their graves from the vulgar, by having their ashes deposited in
churches and cathedrals, and covered by the most superb monuments. In my
late visit to <HI>Westminster</HI> Abby, I could not but remark the
difference of Taste, which has prevailed in setting up these edifices for
the dead. In former times, we find, that they were content to clap up the
bust or statue of the deceased, set round perhaps with the emblems of
his merits, his employment, or station of life. If any person was
remarkable for his virtue and piety, it was pointed out by two or three little
chubby-faced che∣rubims, who were crying for his death, or holding a crown over
his head. The warriour was spread along at full length in a complete suit
of armour, with the trophies of war hung round about him; and the bishop was
laid flat upon his back, with his coifed head resting on a stone bible, and
his hands joined together in the posture of praying.</P>
<P>IF <HI>Socrates,</HI> or any other of the ancient Philosophers
could revive again, and be admitted into <HI>Westminster</HI> Abby, he
would be induced to fancy himself in a <HI>Pantheon</HI> of the Heathen Gods.
The Modern Taste, (not content with introducing <HI>Roman</HI> temples into
our Churches, and repre∣senting the Virtues under allegorical images) has
ransacked all the fabulous accounts of the Heathen Theology to strike out
new embellishments for our <HI>Christian</HI> monuments. We are not in the
least surprised to see <HI>Mercury</HI> attending <PB N="336" REF="17"/>
the tomb of an orator, and <HI>Pallas</HI> or <HI>Hercules</HI> supporting
that of a warriour. <HI>Milton</HI> has been blamed for his frequent
allusions to the Heathen Theology in his Sacred Poem: but surely we are
more to be condemned, for admitting the whole class of their fictitious
deities into the House of God itself.</P>
<P>IF there is not a stop put to this Taste, we may soon
expect to see our churches, instead of being dedicated to the service of
religion, set apart for the reception of the Heathen Gods. A deceased
admiral will be represented like <HI>Neptune,</HI> with a trident in his
hand, drawn in a shell by dolphins, preceded by <HI>Tritons,</HI> and
followed by <HI>Nereids</HI> lashing the marble waves with their tails. A
general will be habited like <HI>Mars,</HI> bearing an helmet and spear in
polished stone; and a celebrated toast will be stuck up naked, like the
<HI>Ve∣nus de Medicis,</HI> cut in alabaster.</P>
<P>IT has been proposed (on a different account) to have a
separate place distinct from our churches, for the reception of our
monuments. I could wish to see such a scheme put in execution: for the
present absurd mixture of the several objects of <HI>Pagan</HI> and
<HI>Christian</HI> belief, as represented on the tombs lately set up in
compliance of the modern taste, must be shocking to every serious
beholder. Our pious fore∣fathers were content with exhibiting to us the usual
em∣blems of death, the hour-glass, the skull, and the cross-marrow-bones:
but these are not sufficient for our present more refined age: The Three
Fatal Sisters, mentioned in the Heathen Mythology, must be introduced
spinning, draw∣ing, and cutting the thread of life. Could one of the last
century see a winged figure blowing a trumpet on the top <PB N="337" REF="18"/> of a modern monument, he would be apt to mistake it for an
arch-angel, and be naturally put in mind of that awful time, 
<Q REND="inline">"when the trumpet shall sound, and the dead
shall rise."</Q> But the design, we are told, is very different; and this
winged messenger is no other than the ancient personage of Fame, who is
proclaiming the virtues of the defunct round the world.</P>
<P>SHOULD any one propose to take down from St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s
Ca∣thedral those paintings of Sir <HI>James Thornhill</HI> representing the
transactions of St. <HI>Paul,</HI> and in their place to set up
<HI>Titian</HI>'s pictures of the amours of the Heathen Gods and Goddesses,
every one would be shocked at the impiety of the proposal. Nor is the
fashion of introducing Heathen Deities into our monuments much less
absurd: for while any of those are suffered to remain in our Churches,
the reproof of our Sa∣viour concerning the Temple at <HI>Jerusalem</HI> may
perhaps be∣come applicable to the present times— 
<Q REND="inline">"My House is an House of Prayer; but ye have
made it a DEN OF THIEVES."</Q></P>
<P>I HOPE I shall not be thought too grave or whimsical, if I
earnestly recommend it to the consideration of those whom it may concern,
whether a reformation is not necessary in our Churches, to purge them from
these prophane images; which, though not the objects of our idolatry, have no
more pretence to be set up in the Temple of the Living Lord, than those of
the canonized Saints of the <HI>Roman Catholics.</HI></P>
<P>MODERN Taste is continually striking out new improve∣ments.
We may therefore conclude, that when our statu∣aries <PB N="338" REF="19"/>
have travelled through the ancient <HI>Pantheon,</HI> and ex∣hausted all the
subjects of the <HI>Grecian</HI> and <HI>Roman</HI> Mytho∣logy, we shall
have recourse to the superstitions of other nations for the designs of
our monuments. They will then probably be adorned with <HI>Aegyptian</HI>
Hieroglyphics, and the tomb of some future hero may be built according to the
model of the Prophet's tomb at <HI>Mecca.</HI> It is not to be doubted, but
that the <HI>Chinese</HI> Taste, which has been already introduced into our
gardens, our buildings, and our furni∣ture, will also soon find its way
into our Churches; and how elegant must a monument appear, which is erected
in the <HI>Chinese</HI> Taste, and embellished with dragons, bells,
Pagods, and Mandarins!</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HERE is no method of reproof more in vogue, than the drawing
invidious parallels between the present times and the past. The grumbling
politician rails over his coffee at the present ministry, and reminds you
with a sigh of the golden Days of Queen <HI>Bess:</HI> while, in mat∣ters
of less consequence, the critic shakes his head at Mr. TOWN, and mentions
BICKERSTAFF. But the mo∣ralists are above all others devoted to this
practice. These wise gentlemen are continually looking backwards, and
con∣demning what lays immediately before them by retrospect. They are for
ever harping on this jarring chord, and have <PB N="440" REF="21"/> scarce
more words in their mouths than the solemn sentences said to be delivered
by Fryar <HI>Bacon's</HI> Brazen Head, <HI>Time is—Time was—Time is
past.</HI></P>
<P>NO comparisons of this sort are so frequently repeated,
and so much insisted on, as those drawn between the An∣cients and
Moderns. If an eloquent member of the House of Commons is cruelly
suspected of bellowing for a place, no∣thing rings in his ears but
<HI>Tully</HI> and <HI>Demosthenes.</HI> If a gen∣tleman or perhaps a
nobleman, with a heavy mortgage on his estate, disencumbers it by selling
his interest at a county election, he is immediately upbraided with one
<HI>Roman</HI> that was not ashamed to follow the plough-tail, and another
who could refuse large bribes, and content himself with a cottage and
turnips. If a lady makes an unfortunate slip, she is told again and again
of <HI>Lucretia,</HI> and fifty other school-boy tales of honour and
chastity. In a word, there is not one fashiona∣ble frailty but has some
stubborn antiquated virtue set in oppo∣sition to it; and our unhappy
metropolis is every day threaten∣ed with destruction for its degeneracy from
the rigid maxims of <HI>Rome</HI> or <HI>Sparta.</HI></P>
<P>IN the midst of all these severe reflections, it gives me
infinite pleasure, that I can with justice take notice of the
incontestable superiority of the Moderns in point of Modesty. The
arrogance of the Ancients was so remarkable, that, in their idea of a perfect
character, they included every public and private virtue. They aimed at a
strict observance of all the duties of life: and if some old
<HI>Romans</HI> had been stiled Gods while living, it would not have been
such gross flattery as was afterwards practised, in honouring the
Emperors with an <HI>Apotheosis.</HI> Their inflexible honesty was their
perpetual <PB N="441" REF="22"/> boast, and their virtue was their pride. This
high idea of a Perfect Character among the Ancients naturally urged them to
lift themselves to an invidious superiority above the rest of the world:
while the modest Moderns, by taking all the vices instead of the virtues
into their notion of a Fine Gentle∣man, endeavour to let themselves down to a
level with the lowest of their species, and have laid the surest
foundation for humility. Fine Gentlemen are so far from being proud, that
they are never guilty of any thing which gives them the least reason to be
so: and our Fine Ladies have none of the disgusting haughtiness of
virtue, though indeed they are sel∣dom known to be ashamed.</P>
<P>IT is impossible to devise one method of lowering the good
opinion a man might possibly conceive of himself, that has not been put
in practice. No Fine Gentleman ever aimed at acquiring any excellence, and if
any natural perfections might give some little occasion for pride, the
greatest pains have been taken to destroy them. Good parts have been often
drowned in drunkenness, and a strong constitution sweated away in
bagnios: and in the mean time learning has been totally neglected, lest
improvement should bring on pedantry and literary pride. The most shining
parts in the character of a Fine Gentleman are, that he drinks deep,
dresses gen∣teelly, rides well, can shoe his own horse, and is
possessed of some few other qualifications, which nobody can ever
sus∣pect a mind the least given to ambition would ever labour to acquire.
For my part I am so far from agreeing with our famous satirist that love
of fame is the universal passion, that when I observe the behaviour of
our Fine Gentlemen, I am apt to think it proceeds from the lowest and
humblest turn of mind: indeed their singular modesty appears to me the 
<PB N="442" REF="23"/> only means of accounting for their actions, which
commonly tend to place them in the meanest and most contemp∣tible
light.</P>
<P>NOTHING but this invincible Modesty, and fear of seeming to
aim at excellence, could ever give rise to certain habits, not only
ridiculous, but ungraceful. Good eyes, for instance, are universally
acknowledged to give lustre to the whole coun∣tenance, yet fashion and
humility have blinded the whole town. The beau draws his eyes out of his
pocket, and the beauties kill us through spying-glasses. It has been
known to be the vogue for persons of fashion to lose the use of their
legs, and limp along as if they were crippled: this practice I daily expect to
be revived, for I take it for granted that the tall staves now carried about
must naturally dwindle into crutches. An inarticulate lisp even now infects
the delivery in polite conversation. It is not at all unfashionable to
pre∣tend deafness; and unless the ladies object to it, I do not despair
of seeing the time when the whole modish world shall affect to be
dumb.</P>
<P>THIS humble way of thinking has been carried so far, that it
has even introduced a new species of hypocrisy. Fine Gen∣tlemen, fearing
lest their good qualities should in their own despite overbalance their
bad ones, claim several vices to which they have no title. There is
something very admirable and ingenuous in this disposition among our
young people, who not only candidly discover all their frailties, but
accuse them∣selves of faults, which they never intended to commit. I know a
young fellow who is almost every morning complain∣ing of the head-ache, and
cursing the last night's champagne at the St. <HI>Alban</HI>'s, when I am
well assured he passed his evening <PB N="441" REF="24"/> very soberly
with his maiden aunts in <HI>Cheapside.</HI> I am also acquainted with
another gentleman, who is very fond of con∣fessing his intrigues, and often
modestly takes shame to him∣self for the great mischief he does among
the women; though I well know he is too bashful even to make love to his
laun∣dress. He sometimes laments publickly the unlucky conse∣quences of an
amour, and has more than once been discover∣ed to send pill-boxes and
gallipots directed for himself, to be left at the bar of neighbouring
coffee-houses. The same humble turn of mind induces the frugal to appear
extravagant: and makes many a religious young fellow deny his principles, brave
his conscience, and affect the character and conversation of an Atheist.
To say the truth, the generality of the gay world are arrant hypocrites in
their vices, and appear to be worse than they really are. Many of our
pretended Bloods are, in fact, no more drunkards, whoremasters, or infidels,
than a bully is a man of courage: and are as sincere in their boasts of
vice, as statesmen or beauties in their mutual pro∣fessions of
friendship.</P>
<P>THAT part of the female world, which composes the order of
Fine Ladies, have as much humility as their counterparts, the Fine Gentlemen.
There is something so charming in the fair sex that we should almost
adore them, if they did not lay aside all the pride of reputation, and by
some good-natured familiarities reduce themselves to an equality with us.
It is indeed wonderful to see with what diligence our polite ladies pare off
the excellencies from their characters. When we see them almost as naked as
the <HI>Graces,</HI> it is natural to suppose them as warmly devoted to
<HI>Venus</HI>; and when we hear them talk loosely, and encourage double
meanings in conversation, we are apt to imagine their notions of honour not
very strict <PB N="444" REF="25"/> or severe. But after all this is
frequently mere hypocrisy, and the effect of humility. Many a lady very
wanton in appear∣ance, is in reality very modest; and many a coquet has
lost her reputation, without losing her virtue. I make no doubt but that
several ladies of suspicious characters are not so bad as they seem,
and that there are honourable persons among the gayest of our women of
quality.</P>
<P>TO return whence I see set out, the extraordinary Modesty
of the Moderns, so averse to the arrogant pride of the Ancients claiming
all virtues and good qualities whatsoever, is the only key to their
behaviour. Thus vice, or at least the appear∣ance of vice, becomes
absolutely requisite to pass through the world with tolerable decency,
and the character of a man of spirit. As Sir <HI>John Brute</HI> says, 
<Q REND="inline">"they were sneaking dogs, and afraid of being
damned in those days,"</Q> but we are better informed, and fear nothing but
the appearance of too much virtue. To secure the nobility, gentry, and others
from so shocking an imputation, I shall speedily present the world
with a curious piece, compiled from the practice and principles of the
present times, entitled <HI>A New Treatise on Ethicks; or, a System of
Immoral Philosophy.</HI> In this treatise I have treated at large of Modern
Modesty, shewn the excel∣lence and utility of Immorality, and considered
Drinking, Whoring, Fighting, and Gaming, as the four Cardinal Vices, or in
other words, the principal constituents of Bucks, Bloods and Fine
Gentlemen.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="body of issue">
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">G</SEG>OOD-NATURE is to the mind, what beauty is to the body; and an
agreeable dis∣position creates a love and esteem for us in the rest of
mankind, as an handsome person recommends us to the good graces of the
fair-sex. To say the truth, any little defect in point of figure is
sooner overlooked than a sourness in the temper; and we conceive a more
lasting disgust at a morose chur∣lishness of manners than at a
hump-back or a pair of bandy legs. Good-Nature is, indeed, so amiable a
qualification, that every man would be thought to possess it: and the
ladies themselves would no more like to be accused of a perverse turn of
mind than of an unhappy cast of features. Hence it proceeds, that those
unfortunate stale virgins, usually call'd Old Maids, have both these
heavy censures <PB N="446" REF="27"/> thrown upon them; and are at once
condemned, as ugly and ill-natured.</P>
<P>SOME persons are (according to the strict import of the
phrase itself) born Good-Natured. These fortunate people are easy in
themselves, and agreeable to all about them. They are, as it were,
constitutionally pleasing, and can no more fail of being affable and
engaging in conversation, than a <HI>Hamilton</HI> or a <HI>Coventry</HI> can
be otherwise than beautiful and charming. Yet it is the duty even of these,
who are naturally endowed 
<Q REND="inline">"with the soft parts of conversation."</Q>
to be careful not to deprave or abuse them. They must not rely too
confidently on their native agreeableness of temper: for we should no more
esteem a man, who discovered a negligence of pleasing, than we should
admire a beauty, who was an intolerable slattern. Nor on the other hand,
should they let their Good-Nature run to an excess of com∣pliment and
extravagant civility: for an engaging temper has been as often spoiled by
this troublesome politeness, as a fine shape has been squeezed into
frightful distortions by bad stays, and a fine complexion entirely ruined
by paint.</P>
<P>BUT if this care is requisite even in those few, who are
blest with this native complacency and good humour, how necessary is it
for the generality of mankind to labour at rectifying the irregularities in
their temper. For this pur∣pose it would be fully sufficient, if they would
employ half the art to cultivate their minds, that is daily made use of to
set off their persons. To this important end not only the female delicacies
of paint and essence are called in as auxi∣liaries to the embroidered
suits and <HI>French</HI> perukes, but this anxiety to supply any
personal defect has set the invention of <PB N="447" REF="28"/> artificers
to work with so much earnestness, that there is scarce any external
blemish, which may not be removed or con∣cealed: and however unkindly nature
may have dealt with you, you may by their assistance be made a model for
a statuary, or a pattern for a painter to study. If you want an inch in
height, your shoemaker can supply it, and your hosier can furnish you
with a pair of calves that may put an <HI>Irishman</HI> to the blush. An
irregularity in your shape can be made invisible by your taylor, or at
least by the artist near the <HI>Hay-market,</HI> who daily gives notice,
that he makes steel stays for all those who are INCLINED <HI>to be
crooked.</HI> There are various compounds and cosmetics that will cure
spots and freckles in the complexion, and combs and oint∣ments that will
change red hair to the finest brown. Do you want an eye? <HI>Taylor</HI> will
fill the vacant socket with as bright a piercer as the family of the
<HI>Pentweazles</HI> can boast: or is your mouth <HI>deficient</HI> for want
of teeth, <HI>Paul Jullion</HI> (to use his own phrase) will <HI>rectify
your head,</HI> and fix a set in your gums as even and beautiful as ever
adorned the mouth of a chimney-sweeper. These and many other inven∣tions as
curious and extraordinary have been devised; and there are no operations,
however painful, which have not been submitted to with patience to conquer
personal defor∣mities. I know a gentleman who went through the agony of
having his leg broke a second time, because it had been set awry; and I
remember a lady, who died of a cancer in her breast, occasioned by the
application of repelling plaisters to keep back her milk, that the beauty of
her neck might not be destroyed. I most heartily wish the same
resolution was discovered in improving the disposition. Half the care
that is taken of the body would have happy effects upon the 
<PB N="448" REF="29"/> temper. <HI>Tully</HI> in that part of his
<HI>Offices,</HI> where he speaks of Grace, tells us, 
<Q REND="inline">"that it is destroyed by any violent
per∣turbations either of the body or mind."</Q> It is a pity that mankind
cannot be reconciled to this opinion; since it is likely, they would spare
no pains in cultivating their minds if it tended to adorn their persons. Yet
it is certain that a man makes a worse figure with an ignorant pate than an
un∣powdered peruke, and that knowledge is a greater ornament to the head than a
bag or a smart cocked hat; that anger sets like a blood-shot in the eyes,
while good-nature lights them up with smiles, and makes every feature in the
face charming and agreeable. There is a certain sweetness of
dis∣position, which is sure to procure to those who possess it
the good-will of their acquaintance; but it is as ridiculous for a man to hope
to be beloved, while he neglects to be amiable, as it would be in a lady, who
expects a multitude of admi∣rers, to appear always in a dirty dishabille.</P>
<P>THE difficulty of being convinced that we want this social
turn, is the grand reason that so little pains are taken to acquire and
perfect it. Would a man once be persuaded of any irregularity in his temper,
he would find the blemishes of the mind more easily corrected and amended
than the de∣fects and deformities of the body; but alas! every man is in his
own opinion sensible and good-humour'd. It is, indeed, possible to
convince us, that we have a bad complexion or an aukward deportment, which we
endeavour to amend by washes and a dancing-master; but when the mind is in
fault, self-adulation, the most fatal species of flattery, makes us
cajole ourselves into a belief, that the fault is not in our own
disposition, but in that of our companions: as the mad <PB N="449" REF="30"/> inhabitants of <HI>Moor-fields</HI> conclude all, that come to
visit them, out of their senses. A whimsical person complains of the
perverseness of his acquaintance, and constantly ac∣cuses them of fancy
and caprice: and there never was an instance of a positive untoward man,
that did not continu∣ally rail at the stubbornness and obstinacy of the
rest of the world. A modern Buck damns you for a sullen fellow, if you
refuse a pint bumper, and looks upon you as a sneaking scoundrel if you
decline entering into any of his wild pranks, and do not chuse to lay all
night in the round-house. It was the saying of an old philosopher, that 
<Q REND="inline">"the eye sees not itself:"</Q> but when this
blind partiality is carried so far, as to make us think those guilty of the
folly who make us sensible of it, it is surely as absurd as to imagine,
that the hair-lip or carbuncled nose, a man sees in the glass, belongs to
the figure in the mirror, and not to his own face. This foolish flattery it
is, that makes us think ourselves inflexibly right, while we are
obstinately wrong, and prevents our receiving or communicating, any
pleasure in society. The untractable humourist, while he disgusts all
that are about him, conceives himself to be the person affronted, and
la∣ments that there is no harmony in the conversation, though he is himself
the only one out of tune.</P>
<P>PERFECTION is no more to be expected in the minds of men than in
their persons: Natural defects and irregularities in both must be
overlooked and excused. All I desire at present is, that they would
endeavour with equal earnestness to cultivate their minds, as they do to
adorn their persons. To this end we should examine ourselves impartially,
and not erect ourselves into judges, and treat all the rest; of man∣kind
like criminals. Would it not be mighty ridiculous in <PB N="450" REF="31"/> a
person of quality to go to court in a ruff, a cloak, a pair of trunk
breeches, and the habit worn in the days of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> and while
he strutted about in this antiquated garb, to accuse all the rest of the
world of being out of the fashion? As we are composed of a body and mind,
equal attention should be paid to both; and we should not be anxious to
cloath the person, and at the same time let the mind go naked. We should
be equally assiduous to obtain knowledge and virtue as to put on lace and
velvet: and when our minds are completely dressed, we should take care
that good-nature and complacency influence and direct the whole; which will
throw the same grace over our virtues and good qualities, as fine cloaths
receive from being cut according to the fashion.</P>
<P>I CANNOT conclude better than with a passage from
<HI>Swift</HI>'s <HI>Tale of a Tub,</HI> where the strict analogy between the
cloathing of the mind and the body is humourously pointed out. 
<Q REND="inline">"Man (says he) is a <HI>Micro-coat.</HI> As to
his body there can be no doubt; but examine even the acquirements of his mind,
you will find them all contribute in their order towards furnishing out an
exact dress. To instance no more; is not <HI>religion</HI> a cloak,
<HI>honesty</HI> a pair of shoes worn out in the dirt, <HI>self-love</HI>
a surtout, <HI>vanity</HI> a shirt, and <HI>conscience</HI> a pair of
breeches, which though a cover for lewdness as well as nastiness, is
easily slipt down for the service of both."</Q></P>

<HEAD>To Mr. TOWN.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>—, 
<DATE>June 30 1755.</DATE></DATELINE> 
<SALUTE>DEAR COUSIN!</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WAR, though it has not laid our fields waste or made our
cities desolate, engrosses almost all the at∣tention of this place.
Every farm-house swarms with poli∣ticians, who lay their wise heads
together for the good of the nation, and at every petty chandler's shop in
town, while the half quarterns of tea are weighed out, the balance of
<HI>Europe</HI> is adjusted. The preparations now making by sea and land
are as popular subjects as the price of hay or the Broad-Wheel-Act. Success
to our noble admirals, and a speedy war, are also as common toasts over a
mug of ale as a good harvest: though it must be owned, that some
sel∣fish farmers, who have not an equal share of public spirit and love
of their country with their fellow rustics, are somewhat apprehensive of
the influence, which a war may have upon the Land-tax.</P>
<P>I AM at present on a visit to Sir <HI>Politic Hearty,</HI>
who is one of those country gentlemen, that are continually athirst for
news, and are more anxious about the affairs of the nation, than the care of
their own estates. Sir <HI>Politic</HI> is miserable three days in the week
for want of fresh in∣telligence; but his spirits revive at the sound of
the post∣horn, <PB N="454" REF="35"/> when the mail brings him the <HI>Lomdon
Evening Post,</HI> and a long letter of news from his nephew at the
<HI>Temple.</HI> These Sir <HI>Politic</HI> himself reads after dinner to
me, the cu∣rate of the parish, and the town-apothecary, whom he indulges with
the run of his table for their deep insight into the proceedings of the
government. He makes many shrewd remarks on every paragraph, and frequently
takes the opinion of the two Doctors (for he honours both the curate and
apothecary with that title) on the asterisks, dashes, and italics. He has
also discovered several mysteries in his Majesty's visit to
<HI>Hanover,</HI> has elected a king of the <HI>Romans,</HI> and laid a better
plan for discharging the national debt, than has ever yet been proposed by
<HI>Jacob Henriques.</HI> Many of his reflections have given me great
entertainment but I was never more diverted than at the following droll
incident at one of our late privy councils. Sir <HI>Politic</HI>'s nephew, who,
it seems, has made as great a proficiency in the study of the Humbug as of
the law, sent him down, as a serious prophecy, a new pamphlet humourously
foretelling the des∣truction of the <HI>French</HI> from <HI>Ezekiel.</HI>
This the unsuspicious Baronet read very gravely over, and then turning to
the cu∣rate, cried out, 
<Q REND="inline">"Rare news, doctor!—Come fill a bumper
to <HI>Old England</HI>—We have the bible of our side, you see, and
hark ye, Doctor, I'd advise you as a friend to preach a sermon upon
<HI>Thou shalt be desolate,</HI> O MOUNT SEIR!"</Q></P>
<P>NOTHING at first puzzled the honest baronet, and the
rest of our country politicians so much as the new seat of war. They were
pretty tollerably acquainted with <HI>Brussels, Ghent, Antwerp,</HI> and
the other scenes of action in <HI>Flanders,</HI> but <HI>Virginia,</HI> the
<HI>Ohio,</HI> the Lake <HI>Ontario,</HI> &amp;c. (to use a common phrase)
were quite out of their latitude. This <PB N="455" REF="36"/> difficulty was
however at length surmounted by the tem∣plar's transmitting to his uncle
one of <HI>D' Anville</HI>'s maps, which has enabled the baronet sometimes to
delineate the progress of the <HI>French</HI> up the <HI>Ohio</HI> in
meanders of port winding along the table, and sometimes to demolish the
forts lately raised by the enemy behind <HI>Pensylvania</HI> and at
<HI>Crown Point.</HI> Sir <HI>Politic</HI> has indeed studied Monsieur
<HI>D' Anville</HI> very thoroughly, and I dare say is better ac∣quainted
with his plan of <HI>North America,</HI> than with the map of his own
estate.</P>
<P>WAR never fails of producing several groundless and
contradictory reports; but if Fame is a lying jade in town, she is the
idlest gossip that ever spoke in the country. It is impossible for
you, Cousin, or any of your readers, who reside constantly in
<HI>London,</HI> to form any tolerable idea of a country news-paper. There is
in this town a petty printer who sets his press to work once a week by
publishing a journal, which contains advices more extraordinary, if not
authentic, than the gazette. It has been his custom for some years past
to raise apparitions in country churches, to give accounts of battles fought
in the air, comets, and several other preternatural phoenomena: but since
the rumour of a war, he has dealt in nothing but skirmishes and
engage∣ments. He gave the <HI>French</HI> fleet several furious broadsides
before it sailed from <HI>Brest,</HI> and has gained us several
vic∣tories in <HI>Virginia</HI>; though in his last journal he shot off
both <HI>Boscawen</HI>'s legs, and made him fight, like
<HI>Wither∣ington,</HI> on his stumps; and it was but yesterday that Sir
<HI>Politic,</HI> on the authority of a letter from his nephew, confuted this
intelligence, and set the Admiral on his legs again.</P>
<P><PB N="456" REF="37"/>THIS, Cousin, is the present state
of politics at —, which I think, in the stile of our news-papers, might
cause you much speculation. You would be of great service, if you could
persuade our country statesmen that they would be better employed at
their rustic occupations than in mana∣ging the affairs of the nation, and
that many a man would make a scurvy figure at the helm of the state, who is
of great use at the plough-tail. As to my friend Sir <HI>Politic,</HI> I
should be very glad if he would leave the conduct of the war, and the
destination of our fleets and armies to the mi∣nistry, who will, I doubt
not, adjust matters as prudently as himself, the curate, and apothecary:
and I think his thoughts might be more properly exercised in contriving
some method of redeeming two heavy mortgages that in∣cumber his estate,
than in laying plans for the discharge of the national debt.</P>

<HEAD>To Mr. TOWN.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>July</HI> 14, 1755.</DATE></DATELINE>

<SALUTE>SIR!</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> READ your late paper, shewing the close analogy which
cloathing the body bears to adorning the mind, with great attention: and am
thoroughly persuaded, that the generality of mankind would be as glad to
embellish their minds as to set off their persons, if they could procure
knowledge, virtue, and good-nature, with the same ease that they can
furnish themselves with the ornaments of the body. The clown in rug or
duffel can, at a moment's warning, be furnished with a complete suit of
lace or embroidery <PB N="458" REF="39"/> from <HI>Monmouth-street</HI>: his
long lank greasy hair may be exchanged in <HI>Middle Row</HI> for a smart
bag or a jemmy scratch; and his clouted shoes, with the rough hobnails in
the heel and sole clumping at every step, may be transformed into a pair of
dancing pumps at the <HI>Yorkshire</HI> Warehouse, or the <HI>Old
Crispin</HI> in <HI>Cranbourn Alley.</HI> The draggled street walker can
rig herself with a clean smock, a linen gown, and a hat smartly cocked up
behind and before, in <HI>Broad St. Giles</HI>'s; or if she can afford it,
every pawn-broker will let out a gold watch with coronets, a tissue or
brocaded sack, and all the <HI>paraphernalia</HI> of a countess. But where,
Mr. TOWN, can these people go to cloath their minds, or at what shops are
retailed sense and virtue? Honour and honesty are not to be purchased
in <HI>Monmouth-street</HI>: Know∣ledge is not infused into the head
through the powder-puff; and, as good wine needs no bush, sense is not
derived from the full-bottomed periwig. The woman of the town, vamped up for
show with paint, patches, plumpers, and every external ornament that art can
suggest, knows no me∣thod to beautify her mind. She cannot for any price
buy chastity in <HI>Broad St. Giles</HI>'s, or hire honesty from the
pawn∣broker's.</P>
<P>SEEING therefore at one view the difficulty in obtaining the
accomplishments of the mind, and the exact analogy they bear to dress, I
have been labouring this week past to remedy that inconvenience, and have at
length devised a scheme which will fully answer that purpose. In a word
then, I shall next winter open a shop or warehouse in the most public
part of the town, under the name of a MIND-AND BODY-CLOTHIER: two trades which,
though never yet united, are so far from being incompatible, that they are in
<PB N="459" REF="40"/> their nature inseparable. I shall not only supply
my friends with a suit or a single virtue, but furnish them with
com∣plete habits of mind and body from head to foot: and by a certain secret
art in the form and texture of the things sold, the required virtues shall
be as inherent in them, as the materials of which they are composed. That
such virtues may be transfused by cloaths is evident from experience. In
the narrow extent of my reading, Mr. TOWN, I remem∣ber to have met with an
account of <HI>Fortunatus</HI>'s <HI>Wishing-Cap,</HI> by which he could
transport himself in an instant from one place to another: It is also
well known, that the famous <HI>Jack</HI> the Giant-killer possessed a
sword of sharpness, shoes of swiftness, and a coat of
invisibility. Why then may not I sell a suit of patriotism, a sword
of honour, and retail modesty and chastity to fine ladies in tuckers and
aprons. My scheme is already in great forwardness; and I shall be able to
accommodate my customers by the next birth-day: wherefore, as Messieurs
<HI>Paris</HI> and others daily advertise in the news-papers, I also
chuse to give the world public notice of my scheme, and shall be proud to
see them first apprised of it by means of your paper.</P>
<P>NO one, who duly considers the natural influence, which
cloaths commonly have upon their wearers, will object to my scheme as utterly
impracticable. That a person can put on or throw off the internal habits of
his mind together with his coat or his perriwig, is plain in very numerous
instances. The young counsellor, who every morning in term time takes the
measure of <HI>Westminster-Hall</HI> with the importance of a judge upon
the circuit, at once divests himself of his gravity with the starched
band and long robe, and resumes the spirit of a buck together with the 
<PB N="460" REF="41"/> sword and bag-wig. In the same manner the orthodox
vicar once a week wraps himself up in piety and virtue with his canonicals;
which qualities are as easily cast off again as his surplice; and for the
rest of the week he wears the dress as well as the manners of his
fox-hunting patron. We may learn the disposition of a man by his apparel,
as we know the trade of a carpenter by his leathern apron, or a soldier by
his red coat. When we see a snuff-coloured suit of <HI>ditto</HI> with
the bolus buttons, a metal headed cane, and an enormous bushy grizzle, we as
readily know the wearer to be a dispenser of life and death, as if we had
seen him pounding a mortar or brandishing a clyster-pipe. The different
affections of the mind have been distinguished by different colours; as
scarlet has been made to represent valour, yellow to denote jealousy, and
true blue to signify integrity: but we may likewise discover all the
virtues and vices lurking in the different parts of the apparel. When at a city
feast I see the guests tucking their napkins into their shirt-collars,
as if they were all of them going to be shaved, I very well know that their
thoughts wear a different dress than in the Alley: and when the antiquated
toast is laying on her complexion at the toilette, and repairing the ruins of
beauty, what is she doing but patching her mind with pride and conceit? In a
word, I can discover impudence staring from the bold cock of a
<HI>Kevenhuller,</HI> frugality skulk∣ing in a darned stocking, coquetry
spread out in a hoop∣petticoat, and soppery dangling from a
shoulder-knot. I often please myself with thus remarking the various
dresses of the mind; and by the clue you have already given us I have been
able to unfold the inmost linings of the heart, and discover 
<Q REND="inline">"the very stuff of the thoughts."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="461" REF="42"/>IT must, however, be owned, that in
these matters the nicest penetration may be imposed on; since in the
present random method of dressing, many persons appear in
mas∣querade. This inconvenience, among many others, will be remedied by my
project; for, as whoever deals with me will at once cloath his mind and his
body, the whole town will be dressed in character. Thus if a
chimney-sweeper or a plough-boy put on a suit of embroidery, a sword,
bag-wig, &amp;c. they will at the same time invest themselves with the
inter∣nal dignity of a person of quality: my lady's youngest son may buy
courage with his regimentals, and orthodoxy may be purchased at the same
time with a gown and cassock by the young smarts from the universities.
My scheme also further recommends itself, by laying open the only path to
virtue and knowledge, that the world will chuse to follow: and as my cloaths
will always be cut according to the newest and most elegant manner, these
qualifications of the mind, inherent in them, must necessarily come into
fashion. Thus our fine gentlemen will learn morality under their valet de
chambre; and a young lady of fashion will acquire new ac∣complishments with
every new ribband, and become virtu∣ous as well as beautiful at her toilette. I
depend on your readiness to promote my scheme; but what I most
earnestly intreat of you, Mr. TOWN, is to use your utmost interest with
the polite world, but especially with the ladies, not to discard cloaths
entirely; as by such a resolution my scheme must be defeated: and
indeed it will not be in the power of man to give them virtue, if they
determine to go naked.</P>
<P>AS knowledge and virtue can never be sufficiently
dif∣fused, my warehouse will be calculated for general use, and stored
with large assortments of all kinds of virtues and dresses, that I may
suit persons of whatever denomination. Physicians may be furnished from
my shop with gravity and learning in the tyes of a perriwig; serjeants at
law may be fitted with a competent knowledge of reports under a coif; 
<PB N="460" REF="43"/> and young counsellors may be endued with a sufficient
fund of eloquence for the circuits, in a smart tye between a bob and a flow,
contrived to cover a toupee. I shall sell religion to country parsons in
pudding-sleeves, and to young town curates just come from the university,
in doctors scarfs and cut grizzles: I shall have some pious ejaculations,
whi∣nings, and groans, ready cut out in leathern aprons and blue frocks, for
the preaching fraternity of carpenters, brick∣layers, tallow-chandlers, and
butchers, at the Tabernacle and Foundery in <HI>Moor-fields.</HI> For our
military gentlemen de∣signed to go abroad, I shall have several parcels
of true <HI>Bri∣tish</HI> courage woven in a variety of cockades and
sword-knots: and for our fine gentlemen, who stay at home, I have pro∣vided
a proper quantity of <HI>French Bagatelle,</HI> in cut velvet, lace and
embroidery, neat as imported.</P>
<P>AS the ladies, I suppose, will all of them to a woman be
desirous of purchasing beauty with every branch of the fe∣male apparel, I
am afraid I shall not be able to answer their demands: but I shall have
several dresses, which will make up for the want of it. I shall have
neatness done up in a great variety of plain linnen; decency and discretion
in several patterns for mobs, hoods, and nightgowns; together with modesty
disposed into tuckers, kerchiefs for the neck, stays that almost meet
the chin, and petticoats that touch the ground. I shall also have a small
portion of chastity knit into garters, and laces for the stays, very proper
to be worn at masquerades and assemblies.</P>
<P>I HAD almost forgot to mention, that authors, who are often
in equal want of sense and cloaths, shall be fitted out by me with both
at once on very reasonable rates. As for yourself, Mr. TOWN, I shall beg
leave to present you with an entire suit of superfine wit and humour,
warranted to wear well, and appear creditable, and in which no author would be
ashamed to be seen.</P>

<HEAD>To Mr. TOWN.</HEAD>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>SIR!</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">N</SEG>OTHING appears to me to be more neces∣sary in order to
wear off any particularities in our behaviour, or to root out any
per∣verseness in our opinions, than mixing with persons of ages and
occupations different from our own. Whosoever confines himself entirely to
the society of those who are engaged in the same persuits, 
<PB N="464" REF="45"/> and whose thoughts naturally take the same turn with
his own, acquires a certain stiffness and pedantry of behaviour, which is
sure; to make him disagreeable, except in one particular set of company.
Instead of cramping the mind by keeping it within so narrow a circle, we
should endeavour to enlarge it by every worthy notion and accomplishment;
and temper each qualification with its opposite, as the four elements are
compounded in our natural frame.</P>
<P>THE necessity of this free conversation, to open and
im∣prove the mind, is evident from the consequences, which always follow a
neglect of it. The employment each man follows, wholly engrosses his
attention, and tinges the mind with a peculiar die, which shews itself in
all the operations of it, unless prevented by natural good sense and
liberal education. The physician, the lawyer, and the tradesman will appear
in company, though none of those occupations are the subject of
discourse; and the clergyman will grow morose and severe, who seldom
or never converses with the laity. But if no particular profession has
this influence over us, some darling passion or amusement gives a
colour to our thoughts and actions, and makes us odious, or at least
ridiculous. Fine ladies for instance, by despising the con∣versation of
sensible men, can talk of nothing but routes, balls, assemblies,
birth-day suits, and intrigues; and fine gentlemen, for the same reason,
of almost nothing at all. In like manner, the furious partizan, who has not
been weaned from a mad attachment to particular principles, is weak enough to
imagine every man of a different way of thinking a fool and a scoundrel; and
the sectary or zealot devotes to eternal damnation all those, who will not
go to heaven in the same road with himself, under the guidance 
<PB N="465" REF="46"/> of <HI>Whitefield, Wesley,</HI> or <HI>Count
Zinzendorff.</HI> To the same cause we owe the rough country squire,
whose ideas are wholly bent on guns, dogs, horses, and game; and who has
every thing about him of a piece with his diversions. His hall must be
adorned with stags heads instead of busts and statues, and in the room
of family pictures, you will see prints of the most famous stallions and
race-horses: all his doors open and shut with foxes feet, and even the
buttons of his cloaths are impressed with the figures of dogs, foxes,
stags, and horses. To this absurd practice of culti∣vating only one set
of ideas, and shutting ourselves out from any intercourse with the rest
of the world, is owing that narrowness of mind which has infected the
conversations of the polite world with insipidity, made roughness and
bruta∣lity the characteristics of a mere country gentleman, and pro∣duced the
most fatal consequences in politics and religion.</P>
<P>BUT if this commerce with the generality of mankind is so
necessary to remove any impressions, which we may be liable to receive
from any particular employment or darling amusement, what precautions ought
to be used, in order to remedy the inconveniences naturally brought on us by
the different ages of life! It is not certain that a person will be engaged
in any profession, or given up to any peculiar kind of pleasure, but the
mind of every man is subject to the inclinations arising from the several
stages of his existence, as well as his body to chronical distempers.
This indeed, Mr. TOWN, is the principal cause of my writing to you, for it
has often given me great concern to see the present division between the
young and the old; to observe elderly men forming themselves into clubs and
societies, that they may be more securely separated from youth; and to
see <PB N="466" REF="47"/> young men running into dissipation and
debauchery, rather than associate with age. If each party would labour to
conform to the other, from such a coalition many advanta∣ges would accrue to
both. Our youth would be instructed by the experience of age, and lose much
of that severity, which they retain too long: while at the same time the
wrinkled brow of the aged would be smoothed by the sprightly chearfulness
of youth; by which they might supply the want of spirits, forget the loss
of old friends, and bear with ease all their worldly misfortunes. It is
re∣markable, that those young men are the most worthy and sensible, who
have kept up any intercourse with the old; and that those old men are of
the most chearful and amiable disposition, who have not been ashamed to
con∣verse with the young.</P>
<P>I WILL not pretend to decide which party is most blame∣able
in neglecting this necessary commerce between each other, which, if
properly managed, would be at once so beneficial and delightful: but it
undoubtedly arises from a certain selfishness and obstinacy in both,
which will not suffer them to make a mutual allowance for the natural
difference of their dispositions. Their inclinations are indeed as
diffe∣rent as their years; yet each expects the other to comply, though neither
will make any advances. How rarely do we see the least degree of society
preserved between a father and son! a shocking reflection, when we
consider that na∣ture has endeavoured to unite them by parental affection on
one side, and filial gratitude on the other. Yet a father and son as
seldom live together with any tolerable harmony as a husband and wife; and
chiefly for the same reason: for though they are both joined under the
same yoke, yet they <PB N="467" REF="48"/> are each tugging different ways. A
father might as well expect his son to be as gouty and infirm as himself,
as to have the disposition which he has contracted from age: and a son
might as reasonably desire the vigour and vivacity of five and twenty, as
his own love of gaiety and diversions in his father. It is therefore plainly
evident, that a mutual endeavour of conforming to each other is absolutely
requi∣site to keep together the cement of natural affection, which the want
of it so frequently dissolves: or at at least, if it does not disturb
the affection, it constantly destroys the society between father and
son.</P>
<P>THIS unhappy and unnatural division is often the subject
of complaint in persons of both ages, but is still unremedied because
they neither reflect on the cause whence it proceeds. Old men are perpetually
commenting on the extreme levity of the times, and blaming the young, because
they do not admire and court their company: which indeed is no wonder, since
they generally treat their youthful companions as mere children, and expect
such a slavish deference to their years, as destoys that equality by
which chearfulness and society subsists. Young men do not like to be
chid by an ill-natur'd proverb, or reproved by a wrinkle: but though they do
not chuse to be corrected by their grave seniors, like school-boys, they
would be proud to consult them as friends; which the injudicious severity
of old age seldom will permit, not deigning to indulge them with so great a
degree of freedom and familiarity. Youth, on the other hand, shun the company
of age, complaining of the small regard and respect paid to them, though
they often act with so little reserve and such unbecoming confidence as
not to deserve it. Suppose the old were pleased with the natu∣ral 
<PB N="468" REF="49"/> flow of spirits and lively conversation of youth,
still some respect may be challenged as due to them: nor should the
decency and sobriety of their characters ever be insulted by any improper
or immodest conversation.</P>
<P>I AM an old man myself, Mr. TOWN, and I have an only boy,
whose behaviour to me is unexceptionable: per∣mit me therefore to dwell a
moment longer on my favourite subject, and I will conclude. With what harmony
might all parents and children live together, if the father would strive to
soften the rigour of age, and remember that his son must naturally
possess those qualities, which ever ac∣company youth; and if the son
would in return endeavour to suit himself to those infirmities which his
Father received from old age! If they would reciprocally study to be
agree∣able to each other, the father would insensibly substitute
affection in the room of authority, and lose the churlish severity and
peevishness incident to his years: while the son would curb the
unbecoming impetuosity of his youth, change his reluctance to obey into a
constant attention to please, and remit much of his extreme gaiety in
conformity to the gra∣vity of his father. Wherever such a turn of mind is
en∣couraged there must be happiness and agreeable society; and the
contrary qualities of youth and age, thus com∣pounded, compose the surest
cement of affection, as colours of the most opposite tints by a skilful
mixture, each giving and receiving certain shades, will form a picture, the
most heightened and exquisite in it's colouring.</P>

<OPENER>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> HAVE been very much diverted with your observations on
our honest tradesmen, who make weekly excursions into the neigh∣bouring
villages; and I agree with you, that the generality of our citizens seldom
dare trust themselves out of the sight of <HI>London</HI> smoke, or
extend their travels further than with their wives and chil∣dren in the
<HI>Wandsworth</HI> double post-chaise, or the <HI>Hampton</HI> long
coach. But we may now and then pick up a stray citizen, whom business has
dragged beyond the bills of <PB N="470" REF="51"/> mortality, as it happened to
myself the other day about twenty miles from <HI>London:</HI> and as I was
mightily pleased with his behaviour and conversation, I have taken the
liberty to send you an account of it.</P>
<P>BEING caught in a shower upon the road, I was glad to take
shelter at the first inn I came to; which, if it had been called the NEW
INN, I should have thought, from its antique appearance, that it had been an
house of entertain∣ment in the time of our great grandfathers. I had scarce
alighted, when a strange figure (driven thither, as I supposed, on the
same account with myself,) came soberly jogging into the yard, dripping
wet. As he waited for the steps, before he would venture to get off his
horse, I had the opportu∣nity of surveying his whole appearance. He was
wrapped up in an old thread-bare weather-beaten surtout, which I believe had
once been scarlet; the cape was pulled over his head, and buttoned up close
round his face; and his hat was flapped down on each side, and fastened
about his ears with a list garter tyed under his chin. He wore upon his legs
something that resembled splatterdashes, which (as I afterwards
learned) were cut out of an old pair of boots; but his right shoe was
considerably larger than the other, and had several slits in the upper
leather. He had spurs on, indeed, but without rowels; and by way of whip a
worm-eaten cane, with a bone head studded with brass pins, hung from his
wrist by a string of greasy black leather.</P>
<P>I SOON found I was nobody: for the GENTLEMAN, it seems, took
up the whole attention of the maid, mistress, and ostler, who all of them
got round him, and with much difficulty, by the assistance of the
steps, helped him down. <PB N="471" REF="52"/> My landlady, (after the usual
welcome) before it was pos∣sible for her to see any part of him but his
nose, told him 
<Q REND="inline">"he looked brave and jolly;"</Q> and when
she had led him into the kitchen, she fetched a large glass of what she
called 
<Q REND="inline">"her own water,"</Q> which (she said)
would keep the cold out of his stomach. All hands were now busied in
drawing off his surtout, which discovered underneath a full-trimmed white
coat, and a black velvet waistcoat with a broad gold lace very much
tarnished. The surtout was hung to dry by the fire as well as his coat, the
place of which was sup∣plied by a long riding-hood of my landlady; and as the
gentleman complained of having suffered by a loss of leather, the maid was
dispatched to the doctor's for some <HI>diachylon.</HI> The usual
question now succeeded, concern∣ing dinner; and as he observed I was all
alone, he very courteously offered me to join company, which I as rea∣dily
accepted.</P>
<P>THE important business of dinner being settled, we
ad∣journed into a private room; when my fellow-guest told me of his own
accord, that he lived in <HI>London</HI>; that for these twenty years he had
always come to the town we were now in, once a year, to receive money, and take
orders for goods; and that he had always put up at this house. He then run on
in the praises of the landlady; and tipping me a wink, 
<Q REND="inline">"ay, says he, she has been a clever woman
in her time, before she bore children."</Q> He added, that for his part he
did not like your great inns; for that they never looked upon any thing under a
coach and six. He fur∣ther informed me, that he was married to his present
wife in the first mayoralty of Alderman <HI>Parsons,</HI> and in the very
waistcoat he had on: 
<Q REND="inline">"but, says he, I now wear it only 
<PB N="472" REF="53"/> on a journey; because, you know, a bit of lace
com∣mands respect upon the road."</Q> Upon enquiring about his family, I
found he had three boys; one of whom was bound prentice to himself; the other
was sent to sea, be∣cause he was a wild one; and the third he designed
to make a parson of, because he was grave, and his play-fellows at
<HI>Poule</HI>'s school used to call him 
<Q REND="inline">"bishop."</Q></P>
<P>ALL this while he had sat in my landlady's riding-hood, with
a linen nightcap on his head tyed on the top with a piece of black ribband,
which (he told me) he always rode in, because it was cooler than a wig. But
the saddle-bags were now ordered in; and out of one of them he drew a large
flowing grizzle carefully buckled, which he combed out himself, borrowing
some flour from the kitchen drudger. His splatterdashes were next taken
off, his shoes wiped with a wisp of hay; and being assured by the
landlady herself, that his coat was dry enough to put on, he completely
equipped himself, in order to wait on several tradesmen, with whom he had
dealings, after dinner. As this was not quite ready, we took a walk to the
stables to see his mare: and though the beast seemed as lean and
harmless as <HI>Sancho</HI>'s ass, he assured me he had much ado to
ride her, she was so frisky; 
<Q REND="inline">"for she had not run in the chaise these
two sundays past."</Q></P>
<P>BEING summoned in to dinner, we sat down to a repast of
mutton chops and sheeps hearts, which last he declared to be the
wholsomest eating in the world. He objected to wine, because there was
not a drop good for any thing to be got upon the road; but he vastly
recommended my landlady's home-brewed, which he affirmed to be better 
<PB N="473" REF="54"/> than <HI>Hogsden</HI> ale, or the thatch beer at
<HI>Islington.</HI> Our meal being ended, my companion took his pipe; and we
laid our heads together for the good of the nation, when we mauled the
<HI>French</HI> terribly both by land and sea. At last, among other talk,
he happened to ask me, if I lived in the City? As I was desirous of hearing
his remarks, I answered, that I had never seen <HI>London.</HI> 
<Q REND="inline">"Never seen it? (says he) Then you have
never seen one of the finest sights in the whole world. <HI>Paris</HI> is
but a dog-hole to it."</Q> There luckily hung a large Map of <HI>London</HI>
over the chimney-piece, which he immediately made me get from my chair to look
at. 
<Q REND="inline">"There, says he, there's <HI>London</HI> for
you.—You see it is bigger than the Map of all <HI>England.</HI></Q> He
then led me about, with the end of his pipe, through all the principal
streets from <HI>Hyde-Park</HI> to <HI>White-Chapel.</HI>— 
<Q REND="inline">"That, says he, is the River
<HI>Thames</HI>;—There's <HI>London</HI> Bridge—There my Lord Mayor
lives—That's <HI>Poule</HI>'s—There the <HI>Mo∣nument</HI>
stands: And now, if you was but on the top of it, you might see all the
houses and churches in <HI>London.</HI>"</Q> I expressed my
astonishment at every particular: but I could hardly refrain laughing, when
pointing out to me <HI>Lincoln's Inn Fields</HI>— 
<Q REND="inline">"There, said he, there all the noblemen
live."</Q> At last, after having transported me all over the town, he set
me down in <HI>Cheapside,</HI> 
<Q REND="inline">"which (he said) was the big∣gest street
in the City."—</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">"And now, says he, I'll show you where I
live.—</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">"That's <HI>Bow-Church</HI>—and
there∣abouts—where my pipe is—there—just there my shop
stands."</Q> He concluded with a kind invitation to me to come and see him;
and pulling out a book of patterns from his coat-pocket, assured me, that
if I wanted any thing in his way, he could afford to let me have a bargain.</P>
<P><PB N="474" REF="55"/>I PROMISED to call upon him; and the
weather now clearing up, after settling the ballance of our reckoning with
the landlady, we took leave of each other: but just as I had mounted my

<HEAD>To Mr. TOWN.</HEAD>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>F polygamy was allowed in this country, I am sure I might
maintain a seraglio of wives at less expence than I have brought upon
myself by marrying one woman. One did I say? Alas! I find it to my cost,
that a wife, like a polypus, has the power of dividing and multi∣plying
herself into as many bodies as she pleases. You must know, Mr. TOWN, I
took a woman of small fortune and made her my own flesh and blood: but I
never thought that all her relations would likewise fasten on me with as
little ceremony as a colony of fleas. I had scarce brought 
<PB N="476" REF="57"/> her home, before I was obliged to marry her mother: then
I was prevailed on to marry her two maiden sisters; after that I married
her aunts; then her cousins—In short, I am now married to the whole
generation of them. I do not exaggerate matters, when I say that I am married
to them all: for they claim as much right to every thing that is mine, as the
person whom the world calls my wife. They eat, drink, and sleep with me:
Every room in my house is at their command, except my bedchamber: They
bor∣row money of me:—and since I have the whole family quartered upon
me, what signifies which of them takes upon her my name,—my wife, her
sister, or her twen∣tieth cousin?</P>
<P>O Mr. TOWN! I never sit down to table without the lamentable
prospect of seeing as much victuals consumed, as would dine a whole
vestry. So many mouths constantly going at my expence! And then there is
such variety of provi∣sions! for cousin <HI>Biddy</HI> likes one dish;
my aunt <HI>Rachel</HI> is fond of another; sister <HI>Molly</HI> cannot
abide this; and mother could never touch that:—though I find they are all
of them unanimous in liking the best of every thing in season. Besides,
I could entertain a set of jolly topers at a less rate than it costs me
in light wines for the women. One of them drinks nothing but <HI>Lisbon</HI>;
with another nothing goes down but <HI>Rhenish</HI> and <HI>Spa</HI>; a third
swallows me an ocean of <HI>Bristol Milk,</HI> with as little remorse as
she would so much small beer: my eldest aunt likes a glass of dry
<HI>Mountain,</HI> while the other thinks nothing helps digestion so well
as <HI>Madeira.</HI> 'Twas but the other day, that my wife expressed a
desire of tasting some <HI>Claret,</HI> when im∣mediately all my
good-natured relations had a mighty <PB N="477" REF="58"/> longing for it: but
with much ado I at last prevailed on them to compound with me for a chest
of <HI>Florence.</HI></P>
<P>YOU may imagine, that my house cannot be a very small one:
and I assure you there are as many beds in it, as in a country inn. Yet I
have scarce room to turn myself about in it; for one apartment is taken up
by this relation, another by that; and the most distant cousin must
have more respect shewn her than to be clapped up in a garret with the
maid-servants: so that poor I have no more liberty in my own house than a
lodger. Once, indeed, I in vain endeavoured to shake them off, and took a
little box in the neighbourhood of town, scarce big enough to hold my own
family. But alas! they stuck as close to it, as a snail to her shell:
and rather than not lie under the same roof with their relation, they
contrived to litter together like so many pigs in a stye. At another time,
thinking to clear my house at once of these vermin, I packed up my wife and
mother, and sent them to her uncle's in the country for a month. But what
could I do? there was no getting rid of those left behind: my wife had made
over to them the care of the household, allotting to each of them her
particular employment during her absence. One was to pickle walnuts, another
to preserve sweetmeats, another to make Morella brandy; all which they
executed with the notableness peculiar to good housewives, who spoil and
waste more than they save, for the satisfaction of making these things
at home. At last my wife returned; and all that I got by her journey, was the
importation of two new cousins fresh out of the country, who she never
knew before were the least related to her:—but they have been so kind
as to claim kindred with me by hanging upon me ever since.</P>
<P><PB N="478" REF="59"/>ONE would imagine, that it were
sufficient for these loving relations to have the run of my table, and to
make my house in every respect their own: but not content with this, they
have the cunning to oblige me in a manner to find them in cloaths likewise. I
should not repine, if any of my worthy relations were humble enough to put up
with a cast-off suit of my wife's; but that would be robbing the maid of
her just dues, and would look more like a dependant than a relation: Not but
that they will con∣descend now and then to take a gown, before it is half
worn out, (when they have talked my wife into a dislike of
it)—because it is too good for a common servant. They have more
spirit than to <HI>beg</HI> any thing: but—if my wife has a fancy to
<HI>part</HI> with it—they will wear it, purely for her sake. A cap, an
apron, or an handkerchief, which looks hideous upon her, I always find is very
becoming on any other of the family: and I remember, soon after we were
married, happening to find fault with the pattern of a silk brocade my wife
had just bought, one of her sisters took it from her, and told me she
would have it made up for herself, and wear it on purpose to spite
me.</P>
<P>YOU must know, Mr. TOWN, that upon my marriage I was
indiscreet enough to set up my chariot: and since my family has
increased so prodigiously, this has given them a handle to have a coach
likewise, and another pair of horses, for them to take an airing in. This
also furnishes them with a pretence for running about to public
diversions, where I am forced to treat them all: for they are so very fond
of each others company, that one will hardly ever stir out without the other.
Thus, at home or abroad, they con∣stantly herd together: and what is still
more provoking, <PB N="479" REF="60"/> though I had rather have a route every
week at my house, my wife makes a merit of it, that she keeps little or no
company.</P>
<P>SUCH is the state of my family within doors: and though you
would think this sufficient for one man, I can assure you that I have
other calls on me from relations no less dear to me, though I have never yet
had the happiness to see them. A third cousin by my wife's father's
side was set up in the country in a very good way of business; but by
mis∣fortunes in trade must have gone to jail, if my wife had not teized me
into being bound for him, and for which I was soon after arrested, and
obliged to pay the money. Ano∣ther, a very promising youth, was just out of
his time, and only wanted a little sum to set him up; which as soon as I
had lent him, he run away, and is gone to sea. One of the aunts, who is now
with me, (a widow lady) has an only daughter, a sober discreet body, who
lived as a com∣panion with an old gentlewoman in the country: but the poor
innocent girl being drawn aside by a vile fellow that ruined her, I have been
forced to support the unhappy mother and child ever since, to prevent any
reproach falling on our family. I shall say nothing of the various
presents, which have travelled down to my wife's uncle, in return for one
turkey and chine received at <HI>Christmas</HI>; nor shall I put to account
the charge I have been at, in the gossips fees, and in buying corals,
&amp;c. for half a dozen little ne∣phews, neices, and cousins, to which I had
the honour of standing godfather.</P>
<P>AND now, Mr. TOWN, the mention of this last circum∣stance
makes me reflect with an heavy heart on a new ca∣lamity, <PB N="480" REF="61"/>
which will shortly befal me. My wife, you must know, is very near her time:
and they have provided as great a store of caps, clouts, biggens,
belly-bands, whittles, and all kinds of childbed-linnen, as would set up a
Lying-in Hospital. You will conclude that my family wants no fur∣ther
increase: Yet, would you believe it? I have just re∣ceived a letter, that
another aunt, and another cousin, are coming up in the stage coach to see
their relation, and are resolved to stay with her the month. Indeed I am
afraid, when they have once got footing in my house, they will resolve to
stay with her till she has another and another child.</P>

<OPENER>
<SALUTE>DEAR COUSIN!</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG> MERE Country Squire, who passes all his time among dogs
and horses, is now become an uncommon character; and the most aukward
loobily inheritor of an old mansion-house is a fine gentleman in
comparison to his forefathers. The principles of a town education for∣merly
scarce spread themselves beyond the narrow limits of the bills of
mortality: but now every <HI>London</HI> refinement travels to the remotest
corner of the kingdom, and the polite families from the town duly import to
their distant seats the customs and manners of <HI>Pall-mall</HI> and
<HI>Grosvenor-Square.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="482" REF="63"/>I HAVE been for this fortnight past at
Lord <HI>Courtley</HI>'s, who for about four months in every year leads a town
life at the distance of above two hundred miles from <HI>London.</HI> He
never rises till twelve or one o'clock; though indeed he often sees the
sun rise; but then that only happens, when, as the old song says, he
has 
<Q REND="inline">"drank down the moon."</Q> Drinking is the
only rural amusement he persues, but even that part of his diversions is
conducted entirely in the <HI>Lon∣don</HI> fashion. He does not swill
country ale, but gets drunk with Champagne and Burgundy; and every dish at
his table is served up with as much elegance as at <HI>White</HI>'s or
<HI>Ryan</HI>'s. He has an excellent pack of hounds: but, I believe, was never
in at the death of a fox in his life: yet strangers never want a chace, for
the hounds are out three times a week with a younger brother of Lord
<HI>Courtley</HI>'s, who never saw <HI>London</HI> in his life; and who, if
he was not indulged with a place at his lordship's table, might naturally be
considered as his whipper-in, or his game-keeper.</P>
<P>THE evening-walk is a thing unknown and unheard of at Lord
<HI>Courtley</HI>'s: for, though situated in a very fine country, he knows no
more of the charms of purling streams and shady groves, than if they never
existed but in poetry or romance. As soon as the daily debauch after
dinner, and the ceremonies of coffee and tea are over, the company is conducted
into a magnificent apartment illuminated with wax-candles, and set but with
as many card-tables, as the route of a foreign ambassador's lady. Here
Faro, Whist, Brag, Lansquenet, and every other fashionable game make up
the evening's entertainment. This piece of politeness has sometimes fallen
heavy on some honest country gentlemen, who have found dining with his
lordship turn out a very dear ordinary; and many a good lady has had
occasion to <PB N="483" REF="64"/> curse the cards, and her ill-starred
connections with per∣sons of quality: though his lordship is never at a
loss for a party, for as several people of fashion have seats near him,
he often sits down with some of his friends of the club at
<HI>White</HI>'s. I had almost forgot to mention that her ladyship
<HI>keeps a day,</HI> which is Sunday.</P>
<P>THIS, Dear Cousin, is the genteel manner of living in the
country; and I cannot help observing, that persons polite enough to be fond
of such exquisite refinements, are partly in the same case with the
mechanic at his dusty villa. They both, indeed, change their situation; but
neither find the least alteration in their ideas. The tradesman, when at
his box, has all the notions that employ him in his compting-house: and the
nobleman, though in the far∣thest part of <HI>England,</HI> may still be
said to breath the air of St. <HI>James</HI>'s.</P>
<P>I WAS chiefly induced to send you this short account of
the refined manner, in which persons of fashion pass their time at Lord
<HI>Courtley</HI>'s, because I think it a very striking contrast to the
character described in the inclosed paper. I hope your readers will not do
either you or me the honour to think this natural description a mere creature
of the ima∣gination. The picture of the extraordinary gentleman here
described is now at the seat of Lord <HI>Shaftsbury</HI> at St.
<HI>Giles</HI>'s near <HI>Cranborn</HI> in <HI>Dorsetshire,</HI> and this
lively character of him was really and truly drawn by <HI>Anthony Ashly
Cowper,</HI> first Earl of <HI>Shaftsbury,</HI> and is inscribed on the
picture. I doubt not but you will be glad of being able to communicate it to
the public, and that they will receive it with their usual candour.</P>

<HEAD>The Character of the Honourable W. HASTINGS of
<HI>Woodlands</HI> in <HI>Hampshire;</HI> Second Son of FRANCIS Earl of
<HI>Huntingdon.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IN the Year 1638 lived Mr. <HI>Hastings</HI>; by his
Quality Son, Brother, and Uncle to the Earls of <HI>Huntingdon.</HI> He was
peradventure an original in our Age; or rather the Copy of our ancient
Nobility, in hunting, not in warlike times.</P>
<P>He was low, very strong and very active; of a
reddish flaxen Hair. His Cloaths always green Cloth, and never all worth
(when new) five Pounds.</P>
<P>His House was perfectly of the old Fashion, in the
midst of a large Park well stocked with Deer; and near the House Rabits
to serve his Kitchen; many Fishponds; great store of Wood and Timber; a
Bowling Green in it, long but narrow, full of high Ridges, it being never
levell'd since it was plough'd. They used round Sand Bowls; and it had a
Banquetting House like a Stand, built in a Tree.</P>
<P>He kept all Manner of Sport Hounds, that ran Buck, Fox,
Hare, Otter, and Badger. And Hawks, long and short winged. He had all Sorts
of Nets for Fish. He had a Walk in the <HI>New Forest,</HI> and the Manor
of <HI>Christ-Church.</HI> This last supply'd him with Red Deer, Sea and
River Fish. And indeed all his Neighbours Grounds and Royalties were free to
him, who bestow'd all his Time on these Sports, but what he borrow'd to
caress his Neighbours Wives and Daughters; there being not a Woman in all his
Walks, of the Degree of a Yeoman's Wife or under, and under the Age of forty,
but it was extremely her Fault, if he was not intimately acquainted with her.
This made him very po∣pular; always speaking kindly to the Husband, Brother
or Father: who was to boat, very welcome to his House, whenever he came.
There he found Beef, Pudding, and <PB N="485" REF="66"/> small Beer in great
plenty. A House not so neatly kept as to shame <HI>Him</HI> or his dirty
shoes: the great Hall strow'd with Marrow-bones, full of Hawks-Perches,
Hounds, Spaniels and Terriers: the upper Side of the Hall hung with Fox-skins
of this and the last Year's kiiling; here and there a Pole-Cat intermixt;
Game-keepers and Hunter's Poles in great Abundance.</P>
<P>The Parlour was a large Room as properly furnished. On
a great Hearth paved with Brick lay some Terriers, and the choicest Hounds
and Spaniels. Seldom but two of the great Chairs had litters of young Cats in
them; which were not to be disturbed; he having always three or four
attend∣ing him at Dinner; and a little white round Stick of fourteen Inches
lying by his Trencher, that he might defend such Meat as he had no mind to
part with to them. The Win∣dows (which were very large) served for Places to
lay his Arrows, Cross-Bows, Stone-Bows, and other such like Ac∣coutrements.
The Corners of the Room full of the best-chose Hunting and Hawking Poles.
An Oyster Table at the lower End, which was of constant Use twice a Day
all the Year round. For he never failed to eat Oysters, before Dinner and
Supper, through all Seasons; the neighb'ring Town of <HI>Pool</HI> supply'd
him with them.</P>
<P>The upper part of the Room had two small Tables and a
Desk, on the one side of which was a Church Bible, and on the other the
Book of Martyrs. On the Table were Hawks-Hoods, Bells, and such like; two or
three old green Hats, with their Crowns thrust in so as to hold ten or a
dozen Eggs, which were of a Pheasant kind of Poultry he took much care of and
fed himself. Tables, Dice, Cards, and Boxes were not wanting. In the Hole of
the Desk were store of Tobacco Pipes that had been used.</P>
<P><PB N="486" REF="67"/>On one Side of this End of the Room
was the Door of a Closet wherein stood the Strong Beer and the Wine, which
never came thence but in single Glasses; that being the Rule of the
House exactly observ'd. For he never exceeded in Drink or permitted it.</P>
<P>On the other Side was the Door into an old Chapel, not
used for Devotion. The Pulpit, as the safest Place, was never wanting of
a cold Chine of Beef, Venison Pasty, Gammon of Bacon, or great Apple-pye
with thick Crust, extremely baked.</P>
<P>His Table cost him not much; though it was good to eat
at. His Sports supplied all but Beef and Mutton, except Fridays, when he had
the best Saltfish (as well as other Fish) he could get; and was the Day
his Neighbours of best Quality most visited him. He never wanted a
<HI>London</HI> Pudding, and always sung it in with <HI>My Part lies
therein-a.</HI> He drank a Glass or two of Wine at Meals; very often Sy∣rup
of Gilly-flower in his Sack; and had always a Tun Glass, without Feet,
stood by him, holding a Pint of Small-Beer which he often stirr'd with
Rosemary.</P>
<P>He was well natured but soon angry, calling his
Servants, Bastards and cuckoldy Knaves, in one of which he often spoke
Truth to his own Knowledge; and sometimes in both, though of the same Man.
He lived to be an hundred; never lost his Eye-sight, but always wrote and
read without Spectacles; and got on Horseback without Help. Until past
fourscore he rode to the Death of a Stag as well as any.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HOUGH the following letter was origi∣nally written for the
instruction of a Young Gentleman going to the University, yet as it
contains several just and sensible reflections, (which may be of use
to many of my rea∣ders,) I have willingly complied with the request of my
correspondent in making it the entertainment of to-day.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS you are now going to the University, I would not be
thought to pay so ill a compliment to your own natural good sense, as to
suppose, that you will not (like many young gentlemen of fortune) in some
measure apply yourself to study: otherwise the time you spend there 
<PB N="494" REF="69"/> will be entirely lost; for (as the SPECTATOR very
justly remarks) 
<Q REND="inline">"all ornamental parts of education are better
taught in other places."</Q> At the same time I do not mean, that you
should commence Pedant, and be continu∣ally poring on a book; since that
will rather puzzle than inform the understanding. Though I know many
sprightly young gentlemen of lively and quick parts affect to despise it
altogether, it will be necessary to learn something of Lo∣gic; I mean in
the same manner one would learn Fencing—not to attack others, but to
defend one's self. In a word, you will find it a great unhappiness, when
you return hither, if you do not bring with you some taste for reading: for
a mere Country Gentleman, who can find no society in books, will have little
else to do, (besides following his sports,) but to sit (as squire of
the company) tippling among a parcel of idle wretches, whose understandings
are nearly on a level with his dogs and horses.</P>
<P>IT has been an established maxim, that the world will
always form an opinion of persons according to the company they are known to
keep. In the University, as well as in other places, there are people, whom
we ought to avoid, as we would the plague: and as it is of the utmost
conse∣quence, whether you plunge at once into extravagance and debauchery, or
sink gradually into indolence and stupidity, I shall point out some of
these pests of society in as few words as possible.</P>
<P>THE first person I would caution you against, is the
wretch that takes a delight to turn religion into ridicule: one that employs
that speech, which was given him by God to celebrate his praise, in
questioning his very being. This, as it is impious in itself, is likewise
the height of <PB N="495" REF="70"/> ill-manners. It is hoped there are but few
of them to be met with in a place of sound doctrine and religious education:
but wherever they are, they ought as much as possible to be avoided: and if
they will force themselves into our com∣pany, they should be used with
the same contempt, with which they have the hardiness to treat their Maker.
And this, I can assure you, may be done safely: for I never knew any
body, who pretended to be above the fear of God, but was under the most
terrible apprehensions, whenever attacked by man.</P>
<P>THE next character whom I would advise you to shun, is the
GAMESTER, in some respects not unlike the former. The gaming-table is his
shrine, and fortune his deity; nor does he ever speak or think of any
other, unless by way of blasphemy, oaths and curses, when he has had a
bad run at cards or dice, He has not the least notion of friend∣ship; but
would ruin his own brother, if it might be of any advantage to himself. He,
indeed, professes himself your friend; but that is only with a design
to draw you in: for his trade is inconsistent with the principles of honour
or justice, without which there can be no real friendship. It should
therefore be the care of every gentleman not to hold any commerce with such
people, whose acquaintance he cannot enjoy, without giving up his
estate.</P>
<P>THE next person, whom you ought to beware of, is a DRUNKARD;
one that takes an unaccountable pleasure in sapping his constitution, and
drowning his understanding. He constantly goes senseless to bed, and
rises maukish in the morning: nor can he be easy in body or mind, 'till
he has renewed his dose, and again put himself beyond the reach of
reflection. I would therefore entreat you by all <PB N="142" REF="71"/> means to
avoid an habit, which will at once ruin your health, and impair your
intellects. It is a misfortune, that society should be esteemed dull and
insipid without the assistance of the bottle to enliven it; so that a
man cannot entirely refrain from his glass, if he keeps any company at all.
But let it be remembered, that in drinking, as well as in talking, we ought
always to keep a 
<Q REND="inline">"watch over the doors of our lips."</Q></P>
<P>A LOWNGER is a creature, that you will often see lolling in
a coffee-house, or sauntering about the streets, with great calmness,
and a most inflexible stupidity in his coun∣tenance. He takes as much pains
as the Sot, to fly from his own thoughts, and is at length happily arrived at
the highest pitch of indolence both in mind and body. He would be as
inoffensive, as he is dull, if it were not that his idleness is contagious;
for, like the <HI>torpedo,</HI> he is sure to benumb and take away all
sense of feeling from every one, with whom he happens to come in
contact.</P>
<P>IT were also best to forbear the company of a WRANG∣LER,
or a person of a litigious temper. This sometimes arises, not from any
great share of ill-nature, but from a vain pride of showing one's parts, or
skill in argumentation. It is frequently observed of young Academics in
particular, that they are very apt impertinently to engage people in a
dispute whether they will or not. But this is contrary to all the rules of
good-breeding, and is never practised by any man of sense, that has
seen much of the world. I have some∣times known a person of great
sauciness, and volubility of expression, confuted by the <HI>Argumentum
Baculinum,</HI> and both his head and his syllogism broken at the same
time.</P>
<P><PB N="497" REF="72"/>I NEED not point out to you the
profligate RAKE or the affected COXCOMB, as persons from whose company you
can reap no sort of benefit. From the first the good principles, already
instilled into you, will doubtless preserve you; and I am sure you have
too much real sense, not to despise the absurd fopperies of the
latter. Noted LYARS are no less to be avoided, as the common pests of
society. They are often of a mischievous disposition, and by their
calumnies and false suggestions take a pleasure in setting the most
intimate friends at variance. But if they only deal in harmless and
improbable lies, their acquaintance must fre∣quently be out of countenance
for them: and if we should venture to repeat after them, I am sure it is
the way to be out of countenance for ourselves.</P>
<P>BUT above all I must advise you never to engage, at
least not with any degree of violence, in any PARTY. Be not transported by
the clamorous jollity of talking patriots be∣yond the sober dictates of
reason and justice; nor let the insinuating voice of corruption tempt you
to barter your integrity and peace of mind for the paultry satisfaction of
improving your fortune. If you behave with honour and prudence, you will be
regarded and courted by all parties; but if otherwise, you will certainly be
despised by all. Per∣haps indeed, if you should hereafter engage in
elections, and spend your own money to support another's cause, the
person, in whose interest you are, may shake you by the hand, and
swear you are a very honest gentleman:—just as butchers treat their
bull-dogs, who spit in their mouths, clap them on the back, and then halloo
them on to be tossed and torn by the horns of their antagonist.</P>
<P>AFTER having guarded you against the evil influence of your
own sex, I cannot conclude without throwing in a <PB N="198" REF="73"/> word
or two concerning the Ladies. But that I may not be thought unmannerly to the
fair, I shall pass over their faults; only hoping, that their excellencies
will not tempt you to precipitate a match with one much your inferior in birth
and fortune, though 
<Q REND="inline">"endowed with every accom∣plishment
requisite to make the marriage state happy."</Q> In these hasty and
unequal matches it sometimes happens, that mutual love gives way to mutual
reproaches. We may per∣haps too late repent of our bargain: and though
Repentance be an excellent visiting friend, when she reminds us of our
past miscarriages, and prescribes rules how to avoid them for the future,
yet she is a most troublesome companion, when fixed upon us for life.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>I am, dear sir, your sincere friend, &amp;c.

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">S</SEG>INCE genius is the chief requisite in all kinds of poetry,
nothing can be more con∣trary to the very essence of it, than the adopting,
as beauties, certain arts, which are merely mechanical. There are daily
arising many whimsical excellencies which have no foun∣dation in nature,
but are only countenanced by the present mode of writing: with these it is
as easy to fill our compo∣sitions as to dress ourselves in the
fashion; but the writer, who puts his work together in this manner, is no
more a poet than his taylor. Such productions often betray great labour and
exactness, but shew no genius: for those who sit down to write by rule,
and follow 
<Q REND="inline">"dry receipts how <PB N="500" REF="75"/> poems
should be made,"</Q> may compose their pieces with∣out the least
assistance from the imagination; as an apothe∣cary's prentice; though
unable to cure any disease, can make up medicines from the physician's
prescription, with no more knowledge of physic than the names of the drugs.
Thus the Muse that ought to fly, and 
<Q REND="inline">"ascend the brightest heaven of
invention,"</Q> walks in leading-strings, or is sup∣ported by a
go-cart.</P>
<P>AMONG the many poetical tricks of this sort, none has been
more successfully practised, or had more advocates and admirers, than a
certain fantastical conceit called ALLITERA∣TION: which is nothing more than
beginning two, three, or perhaps every word in a line with the same letter.
This method of running divisions upon the alphabet, and pressing
particular letters into the service, has been accounted one of the first
excellencies in versification, and has indeed received the sanction of
some of our best poets; but wherein the beauty of it consists, is
something difficult to discover: since <HI>Quarles</HI> or
<HI>Withers</HI> might practise it with as much adroit∣ness as
<HI>Dryden</HI> or <HI>Spenser.</HI> It is one of those modern arts in
poetry which require no fancy, judgment, or learning in the execution: for an
author may huddle the same letters on each other again and again, as
mechanically as the printer selects his types, and ranges them in
whatsoever order he pleases.</P>
<P>THIS partial attachment to particular letters is a kind of
contrast to the famous Odyssey of <HI>Tryphiodorus,</HI> where every
letter in the alphabet was in its turn excluded: and the Al∣literator must be
as busily employed to introduce his favou∣rite vowel or consonant, as the
<HI>Greek</HI> poet to shut out the let∣ter he had proscribed. Nothing is
esteemed a greater beauty <PB N="501" REF="76"/> in poetry than a happy choice
of epithets; but Alliteration reduces all the elegancies of expression to a
very narrow com∣pass. Epithets are culled indeed with great exactness, but
the closest relation they are intended to bear to the word to which they
are joined, is that the initials are the same. Thus the <HI>fields</HI>
must be <HI>flowry, beauty</HI> must be <HI>beaming, ladies</HI> must be
<HI>lovely,</HI> and in the same manner must the 
<Q REND="inline">"waves wind their watry way,"</Q> the 
<Q REND="inline">"blustring blasts blow,"</Q> and 
<Q REND="inline">"locks all loosely lay,"</Q> not for the
sake of the poetry, but the elegance of the Alliteration. This beauty has
also taken possession of many of our tragedies, and I have seen
ladies wooed and heroes killed in it: though I must own I never hear an actor
dying with deadly darts and fiery flames &amp;c. but it always puts me in mind
of the celebrated pippin-woman in <HI>Gay</HI>'s <HI>Trivia,</HI> whose head,
when it was severed from her body, rolled along the ice crying <HI>pip, pip,
pip,</HI> and expired in Alliteration.</P>
<P>THE same false taste in writing that 
<Q REND="inline">"wings display'd and altars rais'd,"</Q>
also introduced Alliteration; and Acros∣tics in particular are the same
kind of spelling-book poetry. It is therefore somewhat extraordinary that
those sublime writers, who have disgraced their pages with it, did not
leave this as well as the other barbarous parts of literature to the
<HI>Goths</HI> in poetry: since it is a whimsical beauty, below the
practice of any writer, superior to him who turned the <HI>Aencid</HI> into
Monkish verses. <HI>Shakespeare,</HI> who was more indebted to nature
than art, has ridiculed this low trick with great humour in his burlesque
tragedy of <HI>Pyramus</HI> and <HI>Thisbe.</HI> Besides that noted
passage of 
<Q> 
<L>—With blade, with bloody, blameful blade</L> 
<L>He bravely broach'd his boiling bloody breast,</L></Q> 
<PB N="502" REF="77"/> He before introduces a mock rant, which <HI>Bottom</HI>
calls <HI>Ercles'</HI> vein, which is not only rank fustian, but is also
remarkable for its Alliteration. <HI>To make all split the raging rocks, and
shivering shocks shall break the locks of prison gates—and</HI>
Phibbus <HI>car shall shine from far, and make and mar the foolish
fates.</HI> In this strange stile have whole poems been written, and every
learned reader will recollect on this occasion the <HI>Pugna Porcorum per P.
Porcium Poetam,</HI> which I wish some of our poetasters would
translate, in the true spirit of the original, and praise pigs and pork
with all the beauties of Alliteration.</P>
<P>THE advocates and admirers of this practice have assert∣ed,
that it adds significance and strength of expression to their verses,
but I fear this boasted energy seldom appears to the reader. The
Alliteration either remains unregarded, or, if it is very striking,
disgusts those who perceive it, and is often in itself, from such a
disagreeable cluster of the same letters, harsh and uncouth. There are
very many instances where Alliteration, though studiously introduced,
renders the versification rough and inharmonious; and I will appeal to the
greatest lovers of it, whether the following line, where the repetition was
scarce intended, is one of the most pleasing in all <HI>Virgil</HI>'s
works. 
<Q> 
<L>Neu patriae Validas in Viscera Vertite Vires.</L></Q></P>
<P>IT must be acknowledged, that there is something very
mechanical in the whole construction of the numbers in most of our modern
poetry. Sound is more attended to than sense, and the words are expected to
express more than the sentiment. There are set rules to make verses run
off glibly, or drawl slowly on, &amp;c. and I have read many a 
<PB N="502" REF="78"/> poem with scarce one tolerable thought in it, that has
con∣tained all these excellencies of versification: for which reason I
must confess myself no friend to those critics, who analyse words and
syllables, and discover latent beauties in every letter, when the author
intended that the whole should be taken together. Poetry should seem at
least to flow freely from the imagination, and not to be squeezed from the
droppings of the brain. If we would endeavour to acquire a full idea of what we
mean to describe, we should then of course express ourselves with
force, elegance, and perspi∣cuity: and this native strength of
expression would have more true energy than elaborate phrases, and a
quaint and studied combination of words and letters. Fine numbers are
undoubtedly one of the chief beauties in poetry; but to make the sound echo
to the sense, we should make the sense our chief object. This appears
to me to have been the manly practice of the Ancients, and of our own
<HI>Shake∣speare, Milton,</HI> &amp;c. who breathed the true spirit of
poetry, without having recourse to little tricks and mean artifices, which
only serve to disgrace it. A good writer, who would be above triffling even
with a thought, would never persue words, and play with letters, but leave
such a childish em∣ployment for the small fry of rhimers who amuse
them∣selves with anagrams and crambo. The true poet trusts to his natural
ear and strong conception, and knows that the versification is adapted to
the sentiment without culling particular letters, and stringing them on his
lines; as he is sure that his verses are just measure, without
scanning them on his fingers.</P>
<P>THERE are almost daily published certain Lilliputian
volumes, entitled <HI>Pretty Books for Children.</HI> A friend of mine 
<PB N="503" REF="79"/> who considers the little rhimers of the age as only 
<Q REND="inline">"children of a larger growth,"</Q> who amuse
themselves with rhimes instead of rattles, proposes to publish a
small pocket volume for the use of our Poetasters. It will be a
treatise on the art of poetry <HI>adapted to the meanest capacities,</HI>
for which sub∣scriptions will be taken, and specimens may be seen, at
<HI>George</HI>'s and the <HI>Bedford</HI> coffee-houses. It will contain
full directions how to modulate the numbers on every occa∣sion, and will
instruct the young scribbler in all the modern arts of versification. He
will here meet with infallible rules how to soften a line and lull us to
sleep with liquids and dipthongs; to roughen the verse and make it roar
again with reiteration of the letter R; to set it hissing with
semi∣vowels; to make it pant and breathe short with a hun∣dred heavy
aspirates; or clog it up with the thickest double consonants and
monosyllables: with a particular table of Al∣literation, containing the
choicest epithets for any words that can be wanted. To be illustrated with
examples from the modern poets. The whole to be published about the mid∣dle
of the winter under the title of <HI>The Rhimer's Play-thing,</HI> or,
<HI>Poetaster's Horn-book;</HI> since there is nothing necessary to
form such a poet, except teaching him his letters.</P>

<LETTER>
<HEAD>To Mr. TOWN.</HEAD>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">Y</SEG>OU obliged the world some time ago with a few reflections
on the Gentlemen of the Army: at the present juncture, a word or two on our
Sea-Officers would not be un∣seasonable. I do not mean that you should
presume to direct them how to behave in their several stations, but
rather to remark on their conduct and conver∣sation in private life, as far
as they are influenced by their maritime characters. There is a certain
unfashionable dye, which their manners often take from the salt-water, that
tinctures their whole behaviour on shore. If you could <PB N="506" REF="81"/>
assist in blotting out these stains, and give a new colour to their
conduct, you would add grace and politeness to their ordinary conversation,
and would be of as much service to our naval commanders in this point, as he
was to navigation in general, who first invented the compass.</P>
<P>AS the conversation of those fair-weather foplings, many
of whom may be met with in the three regiments of guards, is usually flat and
insipid, that of our sea-officers is turbulent and boisterous: and as a
trip to <HI>Paris</HI> has perhaps over-refined the coxcomb in red, a voyage
round the world fre∣quently brutalizes the seaman, who comes home so rough
and unpolished, that one would imagine he had not visited any nation in the
world except the Savages, the <HI>Chinese,</HI> or the <HI>Hottentots.</HI>
The many advantages he has received from having seen the customs and
manners of so many different people, it is natural to suppose, would
render his conver∣sation very desirable, as being in itself particularly
instructive and entertaining: but this roughness, which clings to the
seaman's behaviour like tar to his trowsers, makes him un∣fit for all civil
and polite society. He behaves at an assembly as if he was upon deck; and
his whole deportment mani∣festly betrays, that he is, according to the common
phrase, quite out of his element. Nor can you collect any more from him
concerning the several nations he has visited, than if he had been during
the whole time confined to his cabin: and he seems to know as little of them,
as the fine gentleman of his travels after the polite tour, when he has, for
the sake of improvement, rid post through all <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>THAT our ordinary seamen, who are, many of them draughted
from the very lowest of the populace, should be thus uncivilized, is no
wonder. The common sailor's <PB N="507" REF="82"/> education in <HI>Broad St.
Giles's, Tottenham Court,</HI> or at <HI>Hock∣ley in the Hole,</HI> has not
qualified him to improve by just reflections on what he sees during his
voyage; and going on board a man of war is a kind of university education,
suitably adapted to the principles imbibed in the polite semi∣naries, which
he came from. A common sailor too is full as polite as a common soldier;
and behaves as genteely to a <HI>Wapping</HI> landlady as the gentleman
soldier at a suttling-house. But surely there ought to be as much
difference in the behaviour of the commander and his crew, as there is in their
situation: and it is beneath the dignity of the <HI>British</HI> Flag to
have an Admiral behave as rudely as a Swabber, or a Commodore as foul-mouthed
as a Boatswain.</P>
<P>IT may perhaps be alledged in excuse, that the being placed
among such a boisterous set of people, as our com∣mon sailors, must
unavoidably wear off all politeness and good-manners: as it is remarkable,
that all those who are employed in the care of horses, grow as mere brutes
as the animals they attend; and as we may often observe those justices,
whose chief business is the examination of high∣waymen, house-breakers,
and street-walkers, grow at least as vulgar and foul-mouthed as a
pick-pocket. As there may be some truth in this, the commander should
therefore be still more on his guard to preserve the gentleman in his
behaviour, and like the sea itself, when the storm is over, grow smooth
and calm. It is accounted a piece of humour on the <HI>Thames</HI> to abuse
the other passengers on the water; and there are certain set terms of
abuse, which fly to and fro from one boat to another on this occasion. A
wag might perhaps amuse himself with this water-language in his voyage to
<HI>Vaux-Hall,</HI> but must be a very silly fellow indeed, to think of
carrying the joke on shore with him. In <PB N="508" REF="83"/> the same
manner some roughness may perhaps be necessary to keep the crew in
order; but it is absurd for an officer to retain his harshness in polite
company: and is in a manner tying his friends up to the yard-arm, and
disciplining all his acquaintance with the cat-of-nine-tails.</P>
<P>BUT the worst part of this maritime character is a certain
invincible contempt, which they often contract for all man∣kind, except their
fellow-seamen. They look on the rest of the world as a set of
fresh-water wretches, who could be of no service in a storm or an
engagement; and from an unaccountable obstinacy are particularly deaf to any
proposals of new improvements in navigation: though experience daily teaches
them the great use of the discoveries already made, and how much room there
is for more. They have no notion, how studious men can sit in their
closets, and devise charts and instruments to direct them in their
course; and despise those ingenious persons, who would assist
them in their undertakings; while they consider them with the utmost
contempt, as going round the world in their closets, and sailing at sea
in their elbow-chairs. It is no less shameful than true, that the
Ventilator, one of the most beneficial inventions that ever was devised,
was first offered to the service of our men of war, and rejected. It was
first used in foreign ships, then by our merchantmen, and last of all
among our men of war, to whose use it was first recom∣mended. This is a
strong proof of that fatal obstinacy, which our Sea-Commanders are too apt
to contract; and as a further instance of it, I have been told of an
Admiral's indignation on this subject, venting itself in the following
manner. 
<Q REND="inline">"A pack of blockheads, (said he,) sit
poring, and pretend to make improvements for our use. They 
<PB N="509" REF="84"/> tell you that they discover this, and discover that;
but I tell you they are all fools.—For instance now, they say the
world is round; every one of them says the world is round;—but I have
been all round the world, and it is as flat as this table."</Q></P>
<P>THE chief reason of their unpolished behaviour is owing to
their being often sent to sea very young with little or no education,
beyond what they have received perhaps at the academy of <HI>Woolwich</HI> or
<HI>Portsmouth.</HI> A lad of good family, but untoward parts, or
mischievous disposition, who has been flogged for a while at the
grammar-school, or snubbed by his parents and friends at home, is
frequently clapped on board a ship in order to tame him, and to teach him
better manners. Here perhaps he at first messes with the lowest of the
seamen: and all that the young gentle∣man can learn from his jolly mesmates
in the course of two or three voyages, is to drink flip, sing a bawdy
catch, and dance an horn-pipe. These genteel accomplishments he is sure
to retain, as he grows old in the service; and if he has the good fortune to
rise to a command, he is as surly and brutal when advanced to the cabin, as
when he was tugging before the mast.</P>
<P>AFTER all it is but justice to confess, that there are
many among our Sea-Officers, who deservedly bear the character of gentlemen
and scholars; and it is easy to perceive, with how much better grace they
appear in the world than the rest of their brethren, who (when laid up and
taken out of service) are as mere logs as the main-mast. An officer, who
has any relish for reading, will employ the many vacant hours (in which he is
relieved from duty) much more to his improve∣ment <PB N="510" REF="85"/> and
satisfaction, than in sauntering between the decks, or muddling over a bowl
of punch. I would therefore seri∣ously recommend it to those young
sailors, who have the hap∣piness to launch forth with a genteel and liberal
education, not to suffer every trace of it to be washed away, like words
written on the sands; but that, when they return from sea, they may be fit
to be admitted at St. <HI>James</HI>'s, as well as at <HI>Wapping</HI> or
<HI>Rotherhithe.</HI></P>
<P>BEFORE I conclude, I must beg leave to say a word or two
concerning our Sea-Chaplains. The common sailors are known to have, when on
board, a very serious regard for religion; and their decent behaviour at
prayers, and sedate attention to the sermon upon quarter-deck, might
shame a more polite audience at St. <HI>James</HI>'s Church. For this
rea∣son a truly religious Chaplain of good morals and sober con∣versation
will necessarily have as much influence on their be∣haviour, as a mild and
prudent Commander: Nor can a clergyman be too circumspect in this point;
since, if he does not act in every respect conformable to his function, his
place for ought I know might be as well supplied by any one of the
unbeneficed Doctors of the Fleet. In a word, if a Chaplain will so far
divest himself of his sacred character, as to drink, swear, and behave
in every respect like a com∣mon sailor, he should be obliged to work in
the gang-way all the rest of the week, and on sundays be invested with a
jacket and trowsers instead of his canonicals.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">S</SEG>O long ago as my fourth number (the reader perhaps may not
remember) I made men∣tion of a FEMALE THERMOMETER, constructed by my
ingenious friend Mr. <HI>James Ayscough,</HI> Optician, on
<HI>Ludgate-Hill</HI>; and I then informed the public, that 
<Q REND="inline">"the liquor contained within the tube was a
chymical mixture, which being acted upon by the circulation of the blood and
animal spirits, would rise and fall according to the desires and
affections of the wearer."</Q> But I have now the further satisfaction to
acquaint my fair readers, that after several repeated trials and improvements
we have at length brought <PB N="512" REF="87"/> the instrument to so great
a degree of perfection, that any common by-stander may, by a proper
application of it, know the exact temperature of any lady's passions. The
liquor, among other secret ingredients, is distilled <HI>secundúm
artem</HI> from the herbs lady's love, and maiden-hair, the wax of virgin-bees,
and the five greater hot and cold seeds: and the properties of it are so
subtle and penetrating, that immediately on its coming within the
atmosphere of a lady's affections, it is actuated by them in the same
manner, as the spirits are by the impulse of the air in the common
Ther∣mometer.</P>
<P>IT was not without some difficulty, that we could settle the
different degrees of heat and cold in a lady's desires, which it would be
proper to delineate on our Thermometer: but at last we found, that the whole
scale of female characters might be reduced to one or other of the
fol∣lowing; <HI>viz.</HI> 
<LIST>
<ITEM>Abandoned IMPUDENCE.</ITEM>
<ITEM>— GALLANTRY.</ITEM>
<ITEM>— LOOSE BEHAVIOUR.</ITEM>
<ITEM>— INNOCENT FREEDOMS.</ITEM>
<ITEM>— INDISCRETIONS.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Inviolable MODESTY.</ITEM>
</LIST> </P>
<P>FROM these degrees, which we have accurately marked on the
side of the tube, we have been able to judge of the characters of several
ladies, on whom we have made the experiment. In some of these we have found
the grada∣tions very sudden; and that the liquor has risen very fast from
the lowest point to the highest. We could likewise discover, that it
was differently affected according to the <PB N="513" REF="88"/> different
station and quality of the subject: so that the same actions, which in
a lady of fashion scarce raised the liquor beyond INDISCRETIONS, in
another caused it to mount almost to IMPUDENCE. Much also depended upon
the air and temperature of the place, where we made our trials: and even the
dress had some influence on our Thermo∣meter; as we frequently observed,
that the rise and fall of the liquor in the tube bore an exact proportion to
the rise and fall of the stays and petticoat.</P>
<P>I SHALL now proceed to give a succinct account of the many
repeated experiments, which we have made on differ∣ent subjects in different
places. During the winter season we had frequent opportunities of trying
the effects, which the play-house, the opera, and other places of
diversion, might have on the Thermometer. At the play-house we always found
the liquor rise in proportion, as the drama was more or less indecent or
immoral: at some comedies, and particularly the <HI>Chances,</HI> its
elevation kept pace exactly with the lusciousness of the dialogue and the
ripening of the plot; so that it has often happened, that with some
subjects, at the opening of the play, the liquor has struggled a-while, and
rose and sunk about the degrees just above MODESTY; but before the third
act it has stood suspended at the middle point between MODESTY and
IMPUDENCE; in the fourth act it has advanced as far as LOOSE BEHA∣VIOUR; and at
the conclusion of the play it has settled at downright IMPUDENCE. At public
concerts, and the opera especially, we observed that the Thermometer
constantly kept time (if I may say so) with the music and singing:
and both at the opera and the play-house, it always regulated its motions by
the dancer's heels. We have frequently <PB N="514" REF="89"/> made trials of our
instrument at the masquerades in the <HI>Hay-Market</HI>: but the
temperature of that climate has proved so exceeding hot, that on the moment
of our coming into the room the liquor has boiled up with a surprising
effer∣vescence to ABANDONED IMPUDENCE.</P>
<P>DURING the summer season we have not failed to make our
observations on the company at the public gardens. Here we found, indeed,
that with some raw unpolished females, who came only to eat cheese-cakes
and see the fire-works, the liquor did not stir beyond MODESTY; with many
it has crept up to INDISCRETIONS; and with some it has advanced to LOOSE
BEHAVIOUR. We had no opportunity to try our Thermometer in the dark walks: but
with some subjects we have plainly perceived the liquor hastening up
towards INNOCENT FREEDOMS, as they were retiring to these walks from the
rest of the company; whilst with others, who have gone the same way, it
has only con∣tinued to point (as it did at the beginning of our
obser∣vations) at GALLANTRY. One young lady in particular we could not help
remarking, whom we followed into <HI>Vaux-Hall,</HI> gallanted by an officer;
we were glad to see, at her first going in, that the liquor, though it now
and then faintly aspired towards INDISCRETIONS, still gravitated back again
to MODESTY: after a turn or two in the walks we perceived it fluctuating
between INNOCENT FREEDOMS and LOOSE BEHAVIOUR: after this we lost sight of
them for some time; and at the conclusion of the entertainment (as we
followed them out) we could not without concern observe, that the liquor was
hastily bubbling up to a degree next to IMPUDENCE.</P>
<P><PB N="515" REF="90"/>BESIDES the experiments on those ladies,
who frequent the public places of diversion, we have been no less careful
in making remarks at several private routs and assemblies. We were here
at first very much surprised at the extreme degree of <HI>Cold</HI> which
our Thermometer seemed to indicate in several ladies, who were seated
round the card-tables; as we found not the least alteration in it either from
the young or old: but we at last concluded, that this was owing to their love
of play, which had totally absorbed all their other passions. We have,
indeed, more than once perceived, that when a lady has risen from cards after
so much ill luck as to have involved herself in a debt of honour to a
gentle∣man, the Thermometer has been surprisingly effected; and as she
has been handed to her chair, we have known the liquor, which before was quite
stagnate, run up instantane∣ously to the degree of GALLANTRY. We have
also been at the trouble to try its efficacy in the long rooms at <HI>Bath,
Tun∣bridge, Cheltenham</HI> &amp;c. as it is well known, that these places
have brought about surprising changes in the constitutions of those
SICK ladies, who go thither for the benefit of the waters.</P>
<P>HAVING thus sufficiently proved the perfection of our
Thermometer, it only remains to acquaint my readers, that Mr,
<HI>Ayscough</HI> will be ready to supply the public with these useful
instruments, as soon as the town fills. In the mean time I would advise
those ladies, who have the least regard for their characters, to reflect
that the gradations, as marked on our Thermometer, naturally lead to each
other; that the transitions from the lowest to the highest are quick and
obvious; and that though it is very easy to advance, it is impossible to
recede back again, Let them, therefore, be <PB N="516" REF="91"/> careful to
regulate their passions in such manner, as that their conduct may be
always consistent with decency and honour; and (as <HI>Shakespeare</HI>
says) 
<Q REND="inline">"not stepping o'er the bounds of MODESTY."</Q>
I shall conclude with observing, that these Thermometers are designed
only for the ladies: for though we imagined at first, that they might serve
equally for the men, we have found reason to alter our opinion; since, in
the course of several fruitless experiments on our own sex, there has
scarce appeared any medium in them between MODESTY and IMPUDENCE.</P>

<Q REND="inline">"Wisdom crieth without; she uttereth her
voice in the streets; she crieth in the chief place of concourse, in the
openings of the gates: in the city she uttereth her words,"</Q> and no man
regardeth her. Every lane teems with instruction, and every alley is big with
erudition: though the ignorant or incurious passer-by shuts his eyes
against that universal volume of arts and sciences, which constantly
lies open before him in the highways and bye-places; like the laws of the
<HI>Romans,</HI> which were hung up in the public streets.</P>
<P>YOU must know, Mr. TOWN, that I am a very hard student,
and have perhaps gleaned more knowledge from my reading, than any of your
poring fellows of colleges, though I was never possessed of so much
as an horn-book. In the course of my studies I have followed the example of
of the ancient <HI>Peripatetics,</HI> who used to study walking: and as I
had not the advantage to be brought up a scholar, I have been obliged, like
the <HI>Lacedaemonian</HI> children, to the public for my education. My first
relish for letters I got by conning over those elegant monosyllables,
which are chalked out upon walls and gates, and which (as pretty books for
children are adorned with cuts) are generally en∣forced and explained by
curious hieroglyphics in <HI>caricatura.</HI> I soon made a further
progress in the alphabet by staring up at the large letters upon
play-bills, &amp;c. 'till at length I was enabled to make out the
inscriptions upon signs, bills on empty houses, and the titles on
rubric-posts. From these I proceeded gradually to higher branches of
literature, and went through a complete course of physic by perusing the
learned treatises of Dr. <HI>Rock</HI> and other eminent practi∣tioners.
Having thus laid in the rudiments of literature, my <PB N="519" REF="94"/>
method has since been to visit the <HI>Philobiblian</HI> libraries, and
other learned stalls, and the noble collections at <HI>Moor-fields</HI>; in
which choice repositories I have with infinite pleasure and advantage ran
over the elaborate systems of ancient divines, politicians, and
philosophers, which have escaped the fury of pastry-cooks and
trunk-makers. As for the modern writings of pamphletteers and
magazine-compilers, I make it my business to take my rounds every morning
at the open shops about the <HI>Royal Exchange</HI>; where I never fail to
run through every thing, fresh as it comes out. Thus, for example, I make a
shift to squint over the first page of the <HI>Connoisseur,</HI> as
it lies before me, at Mrs. <HI>Cooke</HI>'s; at the next shop I steal a
peep at the middle pages, at another proceed on to the fourth or fifth, and
perhaps return again to conclude it at Mrs. <HI>Cooke</HI>'s. By the same
means I am myself become a <HI>Connoisseur</HI> likewise; and you will
be sur∣prised when I assure you, that I have a great variety of the
finest prints and paintings, and am master of a more curious set of
nicknacks, than are to be found in Sir <HI>Hans Sloane</HI>'s
<HI>Collection:</HI> for, as I constantly survey the windows of every
printshop, and attend every auction, I look upon every curiosity as
actually in my possession; and you will agree with me, that while I
have the opportunity of seeing them, the real owners cannot have more
satisfaction in locking them up in cabinets and musaeums.</P>
<P>YOU will conclude, that the knowledge, which I have thus
picked out of the streets, has been very extensive: I have learned at every
corner, that the scurvy is a popular disease,—that the bloody flux
cannot be cured by any of the faculty, except the gentlewoman at the blue
posts in <HI>Haydon Yard,</HI>—that nervous diseases were never
so frequent, <PB N="520" REF="95"/> —and that the royal family and
most of our nobility are troubled with corns;—and many other curious
particulars of the same kind: I have also got a smattering of the
<HI>French</HI> language from the advertisements of taylors and staymakers,
and of Mrs. <HI>Dubois</HI>'s portable soop, in <HI>French</HI> and
<HI>English.</HI> I was completely grounded in politics by stopping at
<HI>Temple Bar</HI> every morning to read the <HI>Gazzetteer,</HI> which used
to be pasted up there to the great emolument of the hackney-coachmen upon
their stands. But above all, I have acquired the most sublime notions of
religion by listening attentively to the spirited harangues of our most
eminent field-preach∣ers: and I confess myself highly obliged to the
itinerant missionaries of <HI>Weslley, Whitefield,</HI> and
<HI>Zinzendorf,</HI> who have instructed us in the New Light from empty
barrels and joint-stools. Next to these, I have received great
im∣provements from the vociferous retailers of poetry; as I constantly used
to thrust myself into the circle gathered round them, and listen to their
ditties, till I could carry away both words and tune. I have likewise got
some notion of the drama by attending the theatres; though my finances were
too scanty for me ever to get admittance into them. I therefore had
recourse to the following practice: I would contrive to hear one act at the
outside of one of the pit-doors; the next act I took my stand at the other;
and as the author generally rises in the middle, I could catch the most
tearing parts during the third act in the passage to the two-shilling
gallery: in the fourth act the rants came tole∣ably loud to my ear at the
entrance of the upper gallery; and I very attentively listened to the
pathetic at the con∣clusion of the play with the footmen in the lobby.</P>
<P><PB N="521" REF="96"/>ENDOWED with so much learning, you will
doubtless be curious to know to what purposes I have turned it. Al∣most
before I could read at all, I got into the service of a very eminent doctor
of physick, who employed me in stick∣ing up his bills, and slipping them
slily into the hands of spindle-shanked young fellows, as they passed
by. After this, by closely studying these elegant compositions, I got
together a sufficient set of medical phrases, which (by the help of
<HI>Bayley</HI>'s dictionary) enabled me to draw up bills and affidavits for
those doctors, who were not so happy as to be able to write or read. I was
next promoted to the gar∣ret of a printer of bloody murders, where my
business was to invent terrible stories, write <HI>Yorkshire</HI>
tragedies, or Christ∣mas carrols, and occasionally to put the Ordinary of
<HI>New∣gate</HI>'s Account of Dying Speeches into lamentable rhyme. I was
afterwards concerned in works, that required a greater fund of erudition,
such as bog-house miscellanies, and little books for children; and I was
once engaged as the principal compiler of a two-penny magazine. Since that I
followed the occupation of an Eves-dropper, or Collector of News for the daily
papers; in which I turned a good penny by hunting after marriages and deaths,
and inventing lyes for the day. Once indeed, being out of other business, I
de∣scended to the mean office of a ballad-singer, and hawked my own
verses; but not having a good ear for music, and the tone of my voice being
rather inclined to whining, I con∣verted my ballads into penitential hymns, and
took up the vocation of Methodist Preacher. In this station I made new
converts every day among the old women by my sighs and groans, who in return
contributed their half-pence, which I disposed of in charity—to
myself: but I was at last beat off the field by a journeyman shoe-maker,
who fairly out-whined <PB N="522" REF="97"/> me; and finding myself deserted
by my usual audi∣ence, I became Setter to a Fleet-parson.</P>
<P>MY employment now was to take my stand at the end of
<HI>Fleet-Market,</HI> and whenever I saw any gaping young couple staring
about them, to whisper them softly in the ear, and ask them whether they
wanted to be married; assuring them withal, that ours was the only
marriage-booth in the fair. Whenever the ceremony was performed, I officiated
as clerk: and when my master the doctor died, I made a shift to purchase
his entire stock in trade, (consisting of a rusty cassock, an old
grizzle wig, and one lappet of a band) and succeeded him in his benefice of
the <HI>Hand-and-Pen Chapel.</HI> I now got a more comfortable
subsistance than many regularly ordained curates in the country: but the
marriage-act soon after taking place, I was flung out of employ; and as the
Primate of <HI>May-Fair,</HI> the reverend Dr. <HI>Keith,</HI> is forced to
sell snuff in the Fleet-prison, I have been obliged to re∣tail gin in a
night-cellar.</P>
<P>THUS, Mr. TOWN, have I set before you the progress I have
made in literature, as well as the particular circumstances of my life, in
hopes they will induce you to the notice of the public. As the parliament has
not thought fit to make any provision for the poor distrest Clergy of the
Fleet, I in∣tend to open a New Oratory-Chapel in <HI>Fleet-market,</HI> to be
conducted on the same principles with that established in
<HI>Clare-market</HI>; and for which, I flatter myself, I shall appear no
less qualified by my education, than the renowned <HI>Henley</HI> or any of
his butchers. I shall therefore beg leave to subscribe myself, hoping
for your countenance and protection,</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">E</SEG>ATING and drinking being absolutely requisite to keep our
crazy frames together, we are obliged to attend to the calls of na∣ture, and
satisfy the regular cravings of the appetite: Though it is, in truth, but a
very small part of the world, that eat because they are hungry, or drink
because they are dry. The common day-labourer may, indeed, be glad to
snatch an hasty meal with his wife and children, that he may have
strength to return to his work; and the porter finds it necessary to
refresh himself with a full pot of entire butt, while he rests his load
upon the bulk at the ale-house door: but those, who have more leisure to
study what they shall eat and drink, require some∣thing 
<PB N="524" REF="99"/> more in their food, than what is barely wholsome or
necessary; their palates must be gratified with rich sauces and
high-seasoned delicacies; and they frequently have re∣course to whetters
and provocatives, to anticipate the call of hunger, and to enable their
stomachs to bear the load they lay on it. There are a sort of men, whose
chief pride is a good taste (as they call it) and a great stomach: and the
whole business of their lives is included in their breakfast, dinner and
supper. These people, of whatever rank and denomination, whether they
regale with turtle, or devour shoulders of mutton and peck-loaves for wagers,
whether a duke at <HI>White</HI>'s, or a chairman at the <HI>Blue-Posts,</HI>
are cer∣tainly of the number of those, 
<Q REND="inline">"whom nature, (as <HI>Sallust</HI> tells us,)
has made like the brutes, obedient to their bellies;"</Q> and, indeed, partake
in some measure of the sentence passed on the Serpent, 
<Q REND="inline">"to be cursed <HI>above</HI> all cattle, and
to go for ever on their bellies."</Q></P>
<P>THERE are many follies and vices, which men endeavour to hide
from the rest of the world: but this, above all others, they take a pride in
proclaiming; and seem to run about with the cap and bells, as if they were
ambitious to be ranked among the Sons of Folly. Indeed, as the politeness of
the <HI>French</HI> language has distinguished every glutton by the title
of <HI>Bon Vivant,</HI> and the courtesy of our own has honoured their
beastly gluttony by the name of <HI>Good Living,</HI> the epi∣cure thinks to
eat and drink himself into your good opinion, and recommend himself to your
esteem by an exquisite bill of fare. However this may be, it is remarkable,
that as the fox-hunter takes delight in relating the incidents of the chace,
and kills the fox again over a bowl of punch at night, so the <HI>Bon
Vivant</HI> enjoys giving an account of a de∣licious <PB N="525" REF="100"/>
dinner, and chews the cud of reflection on such ex∣quisite
entertainment.</P>
<P>I HAVE been led into these thoughts by an acquaintance which I
have lately made with a person, whose whole con∣versation is, litterally
speaking, <HI>Table-Talk.</HI> His brain seems to be stuffed with an
hodge-podge of ideas, consisting of several dishes, which he is
perpetually serving up for the en∣terainment of the company. As it was said
of <HI>Longinus,</HI> that he was a Walking Library, in the same manner I
con∣sider this gentleman as a Walking Larder: and as the ora∣tions of
<HI>Demosthenes</HI> were said to smell of the lamp, so my friend's
whole conversation savours of the kitchen. He even makes use of his
stomach as an artificial memory; and recol∣lects every place he has been at,
and every person he has seen, by some circumstances relating to the
entertainment he met with. If he calls to mind any inn, he adds, 
<Q REND="inline">"for there the cook spoiled a fine
turbot:"</Q> another house is recollected, 
<Q REND="inline">"because the parson took all the fat of the
haunch of venison:"</Q> he remembers a gentleman you mention, 
<Q REND="inline">"because he had the smallest stomach he
ever knew;"</Q> or one lady, 
<Q REND="inline">"because she drank a great deal of wine at
supper;"</Q> and another, 
<Q REND="inline">"because she has the best receipt for
making her pickled cu∣cumbers look green."</Q></P>
<P>HIS passion for eating also influences all his actions,
diversions, and studies. He is fond of hare-hunting, as he says his
persuit is animated by the hopes of seeing puss smoking on the table;
but he wonders how any man can venture his neck in a chace after a fox, which,
when it is got, is not worth eating. He has had occasion to visit the 
<PB N="526" REF="101"/> several Wells in this kingdom, which he considers,
not as places where persons go to drink the waters, but where they go to eat;
and in this light he gives a character of them all. 
<Q REND="inline">"<HI>Bath,</HI> says he, is one of the best
markets in the world: At <HI>Tunbridge</HI> you have fine mutton, and most
exquisite wheat-ears: But at <HI>Cheltenham,</HI> pox take the place, you
have nothing but cow-beef, red veal, and white bacon."</Q> He looks upon every
part of <HI>England</HI> in the same light; and would as soon go to
<HI>Cheshire</HI> for butter, and <HI>Suffolk</HI> for cheese, as miss
eating what each particular town or county is famous for having the most
excellent in its kind. He does not grudge to ride twenty miles to dine on a
favourite dish; and it was but last week, that he appointed a friend in
<HI>Buckinghamshire</HI> to meet him at <HI>Uxbridge,</HI> 
<Q REND="inline">"which (says he in his letter) is the best
place we can settle our business at, on account of those excellent
rolls we may have for breakfast, and the delicious trout we are sure to
have at dinner."</Q></P>
<P>MR. CRAMWELL (for that is his name) is so unfortunate as to
want a purse adequate to his taste; so that he is put to several
shifts, and obliged to have recourse to several arti∣fices, to gratify
his appetite. For this purpose he has with great pains constituted a Club,
consisting of persons most likely to promote Good Living. This Society
is composed of members, who are all of them of some trade that can
furnish it with provisions, (except one country squire, who supplies it
with game,) and they are obliged to send in the best of whatever their
trade deals in, at prime cost: by which wise management the Club is
supplied with every delicacy the seasons affords, at the most
reasonable rates. Upon any vacancy much care and deliberation is used in 
<PB N="527" REF="102"/> electing a new member. A candidate's being able to
de∣vour a whole turkey with an equal proportion of chine, or eat one haunch of
venison with the fat of another as sauce to it, would be no recommendation:
On the contrary; there was never more caution used, at the death of a Pope,
to elect a successor who appears the most likely to be short-lived,
than by this Society of <HI>Epicurean</HI> Hogs to admit nobody of a stomach
superior to their own. Mr. CRAMWELL, on account of his extraordinary
profici∣ency in the Science of Eating, is honoured with the office of Caterer;
and has arrived to such a pitch of accuracy in the calculation of what is
sufficient, that he seems to gage the stomachs of the Club, as an
Exciseman does a cask: and when all the members are present, they
seldom send away three ounces of meat from the table. A Captain of a ship
trading to the <HI>West-Indies</HI> has been admitted an hono∣rary member,
having contracted to bring over as a present to them a sufficient cargo of
turtle every voyage; and a few days ago I met CRAMWELL in prodigious high
spirits, when he told me, that he was the happiest man in the world: 
<Q REND="inline">"for now, says he, we shall have Ortolans as
plenty as pidgeons; for it was but yesterday, that we balloted into our
society one of the <HI>Flanderkin-Bird-Merchants.</HI>"</Q> This
association for the preservation of elegant fare gratifies my friend
CRAMWELL's luxury at a cheap rate: and that he may make as many good meals as
possible, he often con∣trives to introduce himself to the tables of
persons of quality. This he effects by sending my lord or her ladyship a
present of a <HI>Bath Cheese,</HI> a <HI>Ruff</HI> or <HI>Land-Rail</HI>
from his friends in <HI>Lincolnshire</HI> or <HI>Somersetshire,</HI>
which seldom fails to procure him an invitation to dinner. It once happened,
that dining <PB N="528" REF="103"/> with an Alderman his appetite got the better
of his good-breeding, when he shaved off all the outside of a
plumb-pudding; and he has ever since been talked of in the city by the name
of SKIN-PUDDING.</P>
<P>AS all his joy and misery constantly arises from his
belly, he thinks it is the same with others; and I heard him ask a perfect
stranger to him, who complained that he was sick, whether he had over-eat
himself. It is no wonder, that CRAMWELL should be sometimes troubled with
the gout: I called upon him the other morning, and found him with his legs
wrapped up in flannel, and a book lying open before him upon the table. On
asking him what he was reading, he told me he was <HI>taking physic</HI>;
and on enquiring whose advice he had, 
<Q REND="inline">"Oh, says he, nobody can do me so much good
as Mrs. <HI>Hannah Glasse.</HI> I am here going through a course of her
<HI>Art of Cookery,</HI> in hopes to get a stomach: for indeed, my dear
friend, (added he, with tears in his eyes) my appetite is quite gone; and I am
sure I shall die, if I do not find something in this book, which I think
I can eat."</Q></P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<DIV2 TYPE="body of issue">
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">H</SEG>ORACE, in the passage quoted at the head of my paper,
tells us (after <HI>Aristotle</HI>) of a man, who used to sit in the
empty theatre, and fancy that he saw real exhi∣bitions on the stage. We
have the like account in another ancient author, of a person that used to
wait with great sollicitude the coming in of ships into 
<PB N="530" REF="105"/> the harbour, believing them to be his own property. The
end of these madmen was also similar: they were both cured; and both
complained, that they were deprived of the satisfaction which they before
enjoyed from a pleasing error of their minds.</P>
<P>THAT the happiness and misery of the far greatest part of
mankind depends upon the fancy, need not be insisted on: <HI>Crede
quòd habes et babes,</HI> Think that you have and you have, is a maxim
not confined to those only within the walls of <HI>Bedlam.</HI> I remember an
humourist, who would fre∣quently divert himself in the same manner with
the mad∣men above-mentioned, and supply his real wants by the force of his
imagination. He would go round the markets, and suppose himself to be
cheapening the most dainty provisions; and when he came home to his
scanty meal, by the same ideal contrivance he would convert his trotters
into turbot, and his small beer into the most delicious Burgundy. As he was
a barber by trade, he would put on the air and manners of his customers,
while he combed out their wigs: with every bag he would conceive himself
going to court or a ridotto; and once, when he was sick, he got together
three or four of the largest tyes, placed them upon blocks round his
bed-side, and called them a consultation of physicians.</P>
<P>BUT of all others, there are none perhaps, who are more obliged
to the imagination for their ideal happiness, than the fraternity of which I
am an unworthy member. There is no set of people, who are more ambitious to
appear grand in the world, and yet have less means, than those gentlemen
whom the world has stiled Authors. Wit and pride as often 
<PB N="531" REF="106"/> go hand in hand together as wit and poverty: but though
the generality of writers are by the frowns of fortune de∣barred from
possessing a profuse share of the good things of this world, they
are abundantly recompenced by enjoying them in speculation. They indulge in
golden dreams, at the time that they have not sixpence in their pockets, and
conjure up all the luxuries of <HI>Pontac</HI>'s before them, though they are
at a loss perhaps where to get a dinner. Thus a Critic by a kind of magic
will transport himself to the thea∣tres in an imaginary gilt chariot, and
be seated at once in the front-boxes; when in reality he has waited for two
hours in <HI>Vinegar-Yard</HI> before the opening of the doors, to secure to
himself a corner in the twelve-penny gallery. Hence it also happens to
most Authors, that though their way of life be ever so mean, their writings
favour of the most unbounded magnificence; and as they have nothing to
bestow, a most surprising generosity always accompanies every action
of the quill. Thus a Novellist, for example, is remarkably lavish of his
cash on all occasions; and spares no expence in carrying on the designs
of his personages through ever so many volumes. Nothing, indeed, is more
easy than to be very profuse upon paper: An author, when he is about it,
may erect his airy castles to what height he pleases, and with a wave of
his pen may command the mines of <HI>Peru:</HI> and as he deals about his money
without once untying his purse-strings, it will cost him the same
whether he throws away a mite or a million; and another dip of ink, by the
addition of two or three <HI>gratis</HI> cyphers, may in an instant convert a
single ten into as many thou∣sands. We must not therefore be
surprised, that the heroes of our modern novels seem to possess the
Purse of <HI>Fortu∣natus,</HI> <PB N="532" REF="107"/> as their writers have
all of them the power of his Wishing-cap.</P>
<P>BUT it must be confessed, that we Essay-writers, as we
are the greatest <HI>Egotists,</HI> are consequently most vain and
ostentatious. As we frequently find occasion to prate about ourselves, we
take abundant care to put the reader con∣stantly in mind of our importance.
It is very well known, that we keep the best company, are present at the
most expensive places of diversion, and can talk as familiarly of
<HI>White</HI>'s, as if we had been admitted to the honour of lo∣sing an
estate there. Though the necessaries as well as the luxuries of life may
perhaps be denied us, we readily make up for the want of them by the creative
power of the imagination. Thus, for instance, I remember a bro∣ther
Essayist, who took a particular pride in dating his lu∣cubrations,
<HI>From my own Apartment</HI>; which he represented as abounding with every
convenience: though at the same time he was working three stories from the
ground, and was often forced to scribble upon wrappers of tobacco for want of
other paper. As to myself, I make no doubt but the reader has long ago
discovered without my telling him, that I loll at my ease in a crimson
velvet chair, rest my elbow on the polished surface of a mahogany table,
write my essays upon gilt paper, and dip my pen into a silver
standish.</P>
<P>Indeed, though I have taken upon me the Title of a CONNOISSEUR,
I shall not presume to boast, that I am pos∣sessed of a
<HI>Musaeum</HI> like <HI>Sloane</HI>'s, or a Library equal to
<HI>Mead</HI>'s. But as <HI>Pliny,</HI> and after him our countryman Mr.
<HI>Pope,</HI> have left us a description of their elegant <HI>Villa,</HI> I
hope <PB N="533" REF="108"/> it will not be thought arrogance in me (after what
I have said,) if I set before the reader an account of my own STUDY. This
is a little edifice situated at a small distance from the rest of the
house, for the sake of privacy and re∣tirement. It is an ancient pile of
building, and hangs over a small rivulet, which runs underneath it; and as
the entrance into it is shaded by a thick hedge of ever-greens, which cast
a kind of awful gloom about it, some learned antiquarians have been led to
conjecture, that it was formerly a Temple (or rather Chapel of Ease,)
dedicated to one of the heathen Goddesses. This Goddess, they inform me,
was worshipped by the <HI>Romans,</HI> and was probably held in no less
veneration by the <HI>Aegyptians, Chaldees, Syrians,</HI> and other nations.
However this be, the walls on the inside are deco∣rated with various
inscriptions alluding to the religious rites performed there, and hung round
with the rude rhymes of ancient bards.</P>
<P>TO this STUDY I retire constantly every morning after
breakfast, and at other parts of the day, as occasions call. Here I am at
liberty to indulge my meditations unin∣terrupted, as I suffer no one to break
in upon my privacy; and (what will perhaps surprise my readers) I find in
myself the greatest inclination to visit it after an hearty meal. In this
place I have made a very rapid progress in literature, and have gone through
several very learned volumes, which otherwise I should never have looked
into. I have here travelled leaf by leaf through the works of many worthy, but
neglected ancient divines, critics, and politicians; and have turned over many
a modern pamphlet or poem with equal satisfaction. I must not forget to
mention, that (like the scrupulous <HI>Mahometans)</HI> I have often picked
up the <PB N="534" REF="109"/> fragments of several learned writers, which
have come from the chandlers, and lodged them, among others no less
valu∣able, in my STUDY.</P>
<P>I MAY safely boast, that I am indebted for many of my best
thoughts in the course of these papers to the reflections I have had the
leisure to make in this STUDY; which pro∣bably has the same influence on my
mind, as the stew'd prunes, which <HI>Bayes</HI> tells us he always took when
he wrote. But if my STUDY serves to inspire me sometimes with agre∣eable
ideas, it never fails on the other hand to remind me of the mortality of
writers; as it affords repeated proofs, that we may justly say of our
works, as well as of ourselves,

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">G</SEG>OING the other day to visit Mrs. <HI>Penelope Doat,</HI>
after I had waited some time in the parlour, the maid returned with her
mistress's compliments, and informed me, that as she was extremely
busy, she begged to be excu∣sed coming down to me, but that she would
be very glad to see me in the <HI>Nursery.</HI> As I knew she was a
maiden lady, I was a good deal startled at the message; but how∣ever I
followed the servant up stairs to her mistress; whom I 
<PB N="536" REF="111"/> found combing a little white dog that lay in her lap,
with a grey parrot perched on one arm of the settee where she sat, a
monkey on the back, and a tabby cat with half a dozen kittens in the other
corner. The whole room, which was a very large one, was indeed a Nursery for
all kinds of animals, except those of the human species: It was hung every
where with cages, containing parrots, mackaws, ca∣nary birds, nightingales,
linnets, goldfinches, &amp;c. on the chairs were several cats reposing on
soft cushions; and there were little kennels, in the <HI>Chinese</HI>
taste, in almost every corner of the room, filled with Pugs, Fidos, and
King <HI>Charles</HI>'s breed. As soon as the chattering of the birds, the
barking of the dogs, and the mewing of the cats, which my entrance
oc∣casioned, began to cease, 
<Q REND="inline">"You find me here, Sir, (said the lady)
tending my little family, the only joy of my life: Here's a dear pretty
creature (holding up the dog she was combing) a beauty! sir, a fine
long-eared snub-nosed beauty! Lady <HI>Faddle</HI> advertised three
quarters of a year, and cold not get the fellow to it. Ah, bless it, and love
it, sweet soul!"</Q>—And then she stroaked it, and kissed it
for near two minutes, uttering the whole time all those inarticulate
sounds, which cannot be committed to paper, and which are only addressed
to Dogs, Cats, and Children, and may be stiled the language of the Nursery.
Upon ob∣serving me smile, at the embraces she bestowed on her little
motley darling, 
<Q REND="inline">"I am afraid (said she) you don't love
these pretty creatures. How can you be so cruel? Poor <HI>dumb</HI> things!
I would not have them hurt for all the world: nor do I see why a lady
should not indulge herself in having such sweet little company about
her, as well as you men run out estates in keeping a pack of filthy 
<PB N="357" REF="112"/> hounds."</Q> Then she laid <HI>Pompey</HI> on his
cushion by the fire-side, and railed at the barbarity of the human
species to the rest of the creation, and entered into a long
dissertation on tenderness and humanity.</P>
<P>A HUMANE disposition is, indeed so amiable either in man
or woman, that it ought always to be cherished and kept alive in our
bosoms; but at the same time we should be cautious not to render the
first virtue of our nature ridi∣culous. The most compassionate temper
may be sufficiently gratified by relieving the wretches of our own species:
but who would ever boast of their generosity to a lap-dog, and their
conferring eternal obligations on a monkey? or would any person deserve to
be celebrated for their charity, who should deny support to a relation or a
friend, because he maintains a litter of kittens? For my part, before I would
treat a <HI>Dutch</HI> puppy with such absurd fondness, I must be
brought to worship dogs, as the <HI>Aegyptians</HI> did of old; and e'er I
would so extravagantly doat upon a monkey, I would (as <HI>Iago</HI> says
on a different occasion) 
<Q REND="inline">"change my huma∣nity with a baboon."</Q></P>
<P>YET there have been many instances, besides my female
friend, of this fondness for the brute creation being carried to very
ridiculous lengths. The grave doctors of the faculty have been called in to
feel the pulse of a lap-dog, and inspect the urine of a squirrel: nay, I
am myself acquainted with a lady, who carried this matter so far, as to
discharge her chaplain, because he refused to bury her monkey. But the
most solemn piece of mummery on these occasions is the making
provisions for these animals by will; which absurd legacies as little
deserve the title of humanity, as those people <PB N="538" REF="113"/> merit
being called charitable, who in a death-bed fright starve their relations, by
leaving their estates to found an hos∣pital. It were indeed to be wished,
that money left in trust for such uses were subject to some statute
of <HI>Mortmain</HI>; or at least that the gentlemen of the long robe, would
contrive some scheme to cut off the entail from Monkeys, Mackaws,
<HI>Italian</HI> Greyhounds, and Tabby Cats.</P>
<P>THAT a stage coachman should love his cattle better than his
wife and children, or a country squire be fond of his hounds and hunters, is
not so surprising, because the reason of their regard for them is
easily accounted for; and a sea∣captain has, upon the same principles,
been known to con∣tract an affection for his ship: but no coachman would,
like <HI>Caligula,</HI> tye his horses to a golden rack, but thinks he
shews sufficient kindness by filling them with good wholesome
provender; and the country sportsman takes care to provide his hounds with
a good kennel and horse∣flesh, but would never think of placing them on
cushions before the fire, and feeding them with fricasees, or breed them
with as much care as the heir to his estate. This irre∣gular passion (if
I may so call it) is most frequently to be met with among the ladies. How
often has the slighted gallant envied the caresses given to a lap-dog, or
kisses be∣stowed on a squirrel! and 
<Q REND="inline">"I would I were thy bird!"</Q> has been the fond
exclamation of many a <HI>Romeo.</HI> But it is remarkable, that this affection
for birds and beasts generally wears off after marriage, and that the ladies
discard their four-footed darlings and feathered favourites, when they can
bestow their endearments on an husband. Wherefore, these dry nurses to
Puggs and Grimalkins are mostly to be met with among those females, who
have been disappointed <PB N="539" REF="114"/> in the affairs of love, and
have against their will retained the flower of virginity till it has withered
in their possession. It often happens, that there is some kind of
analogy between the gallant they once loved, and the animal on which they
afterwards fix their affections: and I myself remember an instance of a
lady's passion for a lawyer being converted into dotage on a parrot; and
have an old maiden aunt, who once languished for a beau, whose heart is now
devoted to a monkey.</P>
<P>BUT I should not so much quarrel with these humane ladies,
who chuse to settle their affections on the brute spe∣cies, if they were
not troublesome to others, who are not so sensible of the charms of a
snub nose, or can discover any beauty in the grey eyes of a cat. A
doating mother would never forgive you, if you did not call her brat a fine
child, and dangle it about, and prattle with it, with as much seeming rapture
as herself: and in like manner, a lady would take it as an affront to her own
person, if you did not pay your adresses equally to her pug or her
parroquet. I know a young fellow, that was cut off with a shilling by an old
maiden aunt, because he gave poor <HI>Veny</HI> a kick only for lifting up
his leg against the gentleman's stocking: and I have heard of another, who
might have carried off a very rich widow, but that he could not prevail upon
himself to extend his caresses to her dormouse. Indeed, I cannot help
thinking, that the embraces and endearments bestowed on these rivals of the
human species should be as private as the most secret intrigues; and I
would have lap-dogs, like fretful and squalling children, confined to bark
and growl only in the Nursery. We may often see a footman following his
lady to church with a common prayer-book under one arm <PB N="540" REF="115"/> a
dog under the other: I have also known a grave divine forced to stop
short in the middle of a prayer, while the whole congregation has been
raised from their knees to attend to the howling of a lap-dog: and I once
saw a tragedy monarch disturbed in his last moments, as he lay expiring
on the car∣pet, by a little black dog of king <HI>Charles</HI>'s breed, who
jumped out of the stage-box, and seizing upon the hero's perriwig, brought
it off in his mouth, and lodged it in his lady's lap.</P>
<P>IT will not appear strange, after what has been said, that
these ladies (or lady-like gentlemen) should be as sollicitous to
preserve the breed of their favourite animals, as a sports∣man of his
hounds and horses. I have known a gentleman in St. <HI>James</HI>'s street
send his little <HI>Cupid</HI> in a sedan chair as far as
<HI>Grosvenor</HI> square to wait upon a lady's <HI>Veny</HI> for this very
purpose: and I shall never forget a Card, which was sent to another lady
on a like occasion, expressed in the fol∣lowing terms.— 
<Q REND="inline">"Mr. —'s compliments to Lady <HI>Betty
—,</HI> is glad to hear Miss <HI>Chloe</HI> is safely delivered, and
begs it as a particular favour, that her ladyship would be pleased to SET
HIM DOWN FOR A PUPPY."</Q></P>

<DIV2 TYPE="body of issue">
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>F we consider that part of our acquaintance, whom we
remember from their infancy, we shall find, that the expectations we once
en∣tertained of their future abilities are in many instances disappointed.
Those, who were accounted heavy dull boys, have by diligence and application
made their way to the first honours, and become eminent for their learning
and knowledge of the world; while others who were regarded as bright lads, and
imagined to possess parts equal to any scheme of life, have turned out
dissolute and ignorant; and quite unworthy the title of a Genius, except in
the modern acceptation of the word, by which <PB N="542" REF="117"/> it
signifies a very silly young fellow, who from his extrava∣gance and
debauchery has obtained the name of a Genius, (like <HI>lucus a non
lucendo)</HI> because he has no Genius at all.</P>
<P>IT is a shocking draw-back from a father's happiness, when
he sees his son blessed with strong natural parts and quick
conception, to reflect that these very talents may be his ruin. If vanity
once gets into his head and gives it a wrong turn, the young coxcomb will
neglect the means of improvement, trust entirely to his native abilities, and
be as ridiculously proud of his parts, as the brats of quality are taught to
be of their family. In the mean time those, whom nature threw far behind him,
are by application enabled to leave him at a distance in their turn; and he
continues boasting of his Genius, till it subsists no longer, but dies
for want of cultivation. Thus vanity and indolence prevents his improvement,
and if he is to rise in the world by his merit, takes away the means of
success, and perhaps reduces him to very miserable distresses. I
know one of these early Geniuses, who scarce supports himself by
writing for a bookseller; and another, who is at leisure to contem∣plate
his extraordinary parts in the Fleet-prison.</P>
<P>IF we look into the world, we shall find that the mere Genius
will never raise himself to any degree of eminence without a close and
unwearied application to his respective business or profession. The
Inns of Court are full of these men of parts, who cannot bear the drudgery of
turning over dry Cases and Reports; but, though they appear ever so
eloquent in taverns and coffee-houses, not the nearest relation will
trust them with a Brief: And many a sprightly physician has walked on
foot all his life, with no more <PB N="543" REF="118"/> knowledge of his
profession than what lies in his perriwig. For whatever opinion they
themselves may have of their own parts, other persons do not chuse to be
bantered out of their estates, or joked out of their lives: And even in
trade, the plodding men of the Alley would foretell the bankruptcy of any wit
among them, who should laugh at the labour of Accounts, or despise the
<HI>Italian</HI> Method of Book-keeping. Thus we see, that parts alone are
not suf∣ficient to recommend us to the good opinion of the world: and even
these, if not roused and called forth by study and application, would
become torpid and useless: as the race∣horse, though not put to drag a
dray or carry a pack, must yet be kept in exercise. But I shall enlarge
no further on this subject, as I would not anticipate the thoughts con∣tained
in the following elegant little Fable; which (as my correspondent informs me)
is written by the same ingenious hand, that obliged the public with the
Verses on <HI>Imitation,</HI> inserted in my sixty-seventh number.</P>

<L>But yet suppose a Genius true,</L>

<L>Whate'er he tries with due intention,</L>
<L>Rarely escapes his apprehension;</L>
<L><PB N="544" REF="119"/>Surmounting ev'ry opposition,</L>
<L>You'd swear he learnt by intuition.</L>
<L>Should he presume alone on parts,</L>
<L>And study therefore but by starts?</L>
<L>Sure of success whene'er he tries,</L>
<L>Should he forego the means to rise?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Suppose your watch, a <HI>Graham</HI> make,</L>
<L>Gold if you will for value sake,</L>
<L>It's springs within in order due,</L>
<L>No watch, when going, goes so true:</L>
<L>If ne'er wound up with proper care,</L>
<L>What service is it in the wear?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Some genial spark of <HI>Phoebus'</HI> rays</L>
<L>Perhaps within our bosom plays.</L>
<L>O how the purer rays aspire,</L>
<L>If Application fans the fire!</L>
<L>Without it Genius vainly tries,</L>
<L>Howe'er sometimes it seems to rise:</L>
<L>Nay, Application will prevail,</L>
<L>When braggart parts and Genius fail.</L>
<L>And now, to lay my proof before ye,</L>
<L>I here present you with a story.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In days of yore, when Time was young,</L>
<L>When birds convers'd as well as sung,</L>
<L>And use of speech was not confin'd</L>
<L>Merely to brutes of human kind;</L>
<L>A forward Hare of swiftness vain,</L>
<L>The Genius of the neighbouring plain,</L>
<L>Would oft deride the drudging croud:</L>
<L>For Geniuses are ever proud.</L>
<L><PB N="545" REF="120"/>His flight, he'd boast, 'twere
vain to follow</L>
<L>For horse and dog, he'd beat them <HI>hollow</HI>;</L>
<L>Nay, if he put forth all his strength,</L>
<L>Outstrip his brethren <HI>half a length.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>A Tortoise heard his vain oration,</L>
<L>And vented thus his indignation.</L>
<L>O Puss! it bodes thee dire disgrace,</L>
<L>When I defy thee to the race.</L>
<L>Come, 'tis a match,—nay no denial,</L>
<L>I lay my shell upon the trial.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'Twas done and done, all fair, a bet,</L>
<L>Judges prepar'd, and distance set.</L>
<L>The scamp'ring Hare outstrip'd the wind,</L>
<L>The creeping Tortoise lagg'd behind,</L>
<L>And scarce had pass'd a single pole,</L>
<L>When Puss had almost reach'd the goal.</L>
<L>Friend Tortoise, cries the jeering Hare,</L>
<L>Your burthen's more than you can bear:</L>
<L>To help your speed, it were as well</L>
<L>That I should ease you of your shell:</L>
<L>Jog on a little faster prithee,</L>
<L>I'll take a nap, and then be with thee.</L>
<L>So said so done, and safely sure;</L>
<L>For say, what conquest more secure?</L>
<L>Whene'er he wak'd (that's all that's in it)</L>
<L>He could o'ertake him in a minute.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Tortoise heard the taunting jeer,</L>
<L>But still resolv'd to <HI>persevere</HI>;</L>
<L><PB N="546" REF="121"/>Still drawl'd along, as who should
say</L>
<L>I win, like <HI>Fabius,</HI> by delay;</L>
<L>On to the goal securely crept,</L>
<L>While Puss unknowing soundly slept.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The betts are won, the Hare awake,</L>
<L>When thus the victor Tortoise spake:</L>
<L>Puss, though I own thy quicker parts,</L>
<L>Things are not always won by starts:</L>
<L>You may deride my aukward pace,</L>
<L>But <HI>slow and steady</HI> wins the race.</L>

<LETTER>
<HEAD>To Mr. TOWN.</HEAD>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE explanation which you gave us some time ago of GOOD
COMPANY, has led me to consider the import and extent of the epithet GOOD;
which, in the modern sense of the word, is indiscrimi∣nately applied to
things very bad in their nature, and is sometimes used only as a term of
reproach.</P>
<P><PB N="548" REF="123"/>To begin, first, with what is called a
GOOD MAN. By this, one would imagine, should be understood an honest,
virtuous, and religious person: but to look for a GOOD MAN, in this strict
acceptation of the phrase, among the men of fashion, would be as vain a
search as that of <HI>Diogenes</HI> with his lanthorn in open day-light. This
appellation is, indeed, very familiarly used among the gentlemen of
<HI>'Change Alley:</HI> but there it is meant only to signify a <HI>Rich</HI>
man. He is there called a GOOD MAN, who is able to answer a bill at sight,
though he is known to be ever so great a cheat. So by the same
unaccountable phraseology, a scoundrel with a large estate is entitled a
<HI>Man of Worth</HI>: as among rakes the HONEST fellow may be the most
abandoned debauchee and great∣est villain upon earth.</P>
<P>BY the same figure, the GOOD FELLOW is he, who at a Country
Wake can soil the best wrestler, break most heads, and challenge the
ring; take <HI>Broughton</HI> by the nose; bid defiance to the
<HI>Clare-Market</HI> butchers; knock down the constables and watch, in
beating the rounds in <HI>Covent-Garden</HI>; bilk the waiter, and kick the
bully out of doors in the hundreds of <HI>Drury</HI>; carry off his six
bottles of port at a sitting; or drink October, till he leaves the country
squire and the parson on the floor.</P>
<P>AS to the other sex, the term GOOD WOMAN is applied, as a
mere expletive without any meaning, to the poor only, or perhaps to get rid of
the importunity of a beggar. In the country, indeed, a GOOD LADY is sometimes
mentioned with a sneer or as a term of reproach; and means one, who is so
old-fashioned, as to go to church, say her prayers, <PB N="549" REF="124"/>
and convert her dressing room into an apothecary's shop. But I would
ask any well-bred lady, if she would be content to banish herself from
the delights of the theatre, opera∣house, masquerades, routs, drums,
assemblies, and the dear card-table, to be confined to the country, have
prayers in her own house twice a day, and do charitable offices to her poor
neighbours, merely to acquire the ridiculous reputation of a GOOD LADY.</P>
<P>I SHALL proceed next to consider what is generally
under∣stood by a GOOD EDUCATION. This is not to be found in either of our
Universities: nor is any learning or know∣ledge implied in it, except what is
called the <HI>Knowledge of the World,</HI> which cannot be attained among
pedants, or gathered from musty books. Common lads may be lashed through a
grammar-school, and afterwards locked up in colleges: but young fellows of
taste and spirit have better opportunities of improving themselves by
mixing with the town and the <HI>beau monde.</HI> For this reason they are
intro∣duced very early into those excellent Seminaries of GOOD EDUCATION
about <HI>Covent Garden,</HI> and placed under the tuition of <HI>Haddock,
Douglass, Harris,</HI> &amp;c. It is also neces∣sary, to ground them in
the genteel principles of infidelity and free-thinking, that they should
attend the disputations at the <HI>Robin Hood</HI> and the lectures of the
<HI>Clare-market</HI> Orator: and it would not be amiss, if they were to get
a little notion of the modern Art of Criticism by frequenting the
<HI>Bedford</HI> and <HI>George</HI>'s coffee-houses. After this it is
proper, to compleat their education, that they should make the tour of
<HI>France</HI> and <HI>Italy</HI>; which will not fail to inspire them with
the laudable love of every thing that is foreign, and a thorough contempt for
their own country. <PB N="550" REF="125"/> Nothing now remains but to instruct
them in the noble Science of Gaming; for which purpose it has been found
expedient to constitute an Academy at <HI>White</HI>'s; where it is taught in
all it's branches. The consequences of such a GOOD EDUCATION, as is here
set down, may be seen in many instances: Some have been enabled by it to
ruin their constitutions, and others to run out their estates. Some have
received the finishing stroke of a GOOD EDU∣CATION at <HI>Tyburn,</HI>
while others have given sufficient proofs of it by being gallantly run
through the body in a duel, or genteelly shooting themselves through the
head.</P>
<P>LET us now take a view of the GOOD EDUCATION, which is at
present in vogue among the fair sex. As the GOOD LADIES of former days were
desirous, that their daughters should make GOOD WIVES, they thought the
first step towards it was to make them GOOD HOUSE∣WIVES. They therefore
bred them up in the domestic arts of pickling, preserving, distilling
simple waters, and the like: they also taught them to work at their needle,
write, cast accounts, and read a chapter in the Bible or some other Good
BOOK, as they are ridiculously oalled. But this method of education has been
found to be fit only for low girls designed to go to service, or poor
parsons daugh∣ters that must come to be milliners, or something worse.
As to ladies of fashion, to learn <HI>English</HI> would only obstruct
their advancement in the <HI>French</HI> language, which they are taught to
<HI>speak</HI> from their infancy, but never to read: besides, they will
get a better knowledge of their mother tongue from the peculiar dialects used
at routes and assem∣blies, and the spirited conversations carried on at
masquerades and other public places, than they could possibly do from 
<PB N="551" REF="126"/> books. All the writing required is to be able to
scrawl out a billet-doux; for which we must also own, that
spelling-books are of no service: and working we know would hurt their eyes
no less than reading: As to religion, honour, virtue, charity, and the like
old-fashioned cant, nobody would think of stuffing any girl's head with it,
above the degree of a chambermaid.</P>
<P>THE present notion of a GOOD Education was, there∣fore,
unknown to the females of former ages; as, besides the usual
accomplishments of dancing, or the like, it will be found to consist in
the knowledge of Intriguing, Dress, and (I may add too) the Card-table. In
the first of these particulars they constantly receive lessons from
the milli∣ners, mantua-makers, and maid-servants; and by being carried about
to all public places of diversion, they soon become proficients in the
sciences. The same tutors like∣wise take care to instruct their young
pupils in the Art of Dress; and I have known a little miss, by the time
she was arrived at her teens, so nice an adept in face-painting, as to
apply the <HI>rouge</HI> to her pretty cheeks with as much elegance and
propriety as her mamma. To conclude, when a young lady has got <HI>Hoyle</HI>'s
rules by heart, and is qua∣lified to play a rubbers at a Sunday route, it is a
sure mark of her having had a compleat GOOD EDUCATION.</P>
<P>THERE are many other instances, in which this word GOOD is
perverted to a very preposterous sense. Thus GOOD LIVING is made to
signify the practice of no other excellence, but what consists in Good
Eating and Drinking: but as you have formerly given us the character of one of
these GOOD LIVERS, I shall only take notice, that the ill 
<PB N="552" REF="127"/> humours consequent of their luxury and intemperance,
which shew themselves in blotches and breakings out on their faces, are
emphatically called their <HI>Goodness.</HI> In like manner, by GOOD BLOOD we
are taught to understand a gentility of birth: and though a nobleman be ever
so noto∣rious for his vices, or though his ancestors have been raised by
the vilest means, his posterity always pride themselves on the GOOD BLOOD
of the family. I would not be thought to quibble about words, when I observe,
that the most shocking and blasphemous ridicule on the sacred tenets of
our religion (though without the least shadow of wit) is by the present
shallow race of free-thinkers applauded as a GOOD JOKE. The most cruel and
unmanly actions are by our Bucks and Bloods set down under the same
denomination: and if blasphemy and profaneness is a GOOD JOKE, a rape or a
murder is upon the same pinciples esteemed a very GOOD THING.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">D</SEG>RINKING is one of those popular vices, which most people
reckon among their venial failings, and it is thought no great blot on a man's
character, to say he takes his glass rather too freely. But as those
vices are most dangerous and likely to prevail, which if not approved are at
least excused by most people, I have been tempted to examine, whether
Drinking really deserves that quarter it receives from the generality of
mankind: and I <PB N="554" REF="129"/> must own, that after a strict
attention to the principal mo∣tives that induce men to become hard-drinkers, as
well as to the consequences which such excesses produce, I am at a
loss to account for the received maxim that 
<Q REND="inline">"in good wine there is truth;"</Q> and should
no more expect happiness in a full bowl, than chastity in the bar of a
tavern.</P>
<P>THE incentives to this practice are some of them very
shocking, and some very ridiculous; as will perhaps appear from the
following characters. Poor <HI>Heartly</HI> was blest with every noble
qualification of the head and heart, and bade fair for the love and admiration
of the world, but was unfortunately bound in a very large sum for a friend,
who disappeared, and left him to the mercy of the law. The distresses,
thus brought upon him by the treachery of another, threw him into the deepest
despair, and he had at last re∣course to drinking, to benumb (if
possible) the very sense of reflection. He is miserable when sober,
and when drunk stupified and muddled: His misfortunes have robbed him of all
the joys of life, and he is now endeavouring wilfully to put an end to them by
a slow death.</P>
<P>TOM BUCK, from the first day that he was put into breeches,
was always accounted a boy of spirit: and before he reached the top of
<HI>Westminster</HI> school, knew the names and faces of the most noted
girls upon town, tossed off his claret with a smack, and had a long tick
at the ta∣vern. When he went to <HI>Oxford,</HI> he espoused the Tory
party, because they drank deepest; and he has for some years been
accounted a four-bottle man. He drank for fame, and has so well
established his character, that he was never known to send a man from his
chambers sober, but gene∣rally laid his whole company under the table. Since
his <PB N="555" REF="130"/> leaving the university, nobody ever acquired more
reputa∣tion by Electioneering; for he can <HI>see out</HI> the stoutest
free∣holder in <HI>England</HI>: He has, indeed, swallowed many a tun in the
service of his country, and is now a sounder pa∣triot by two bottles than
any man in the county.</P>
<P>POOR <HI>Wou'd-be</HI> became a debauchée through mere
bash∣fulness, and a foolish sort of modesty, that has made many a man
drunk in spite of his teeth. He contracted an acquaintance with a set of
hard drinkers, and though he would as soon chuse to swallow a dose of
physic, has not courage to refuse his bumper. He is drunk every night, and
always sick to death the next morning, when he con∣stantly resolves, to
drink nothing stronger than small beer for the future; but at night the
poor fellow gets drunk again through downright modesty. Thus
<HI>Wou'd-be</HI> suffers himself to be prest into the service; and
since he has com∣menced a jolly fellow is become one of the most
miserable wretches upon earth.</P>
<P>HONEST <HI>Ned Brimmer</HI> is at present the most dismal
object that ever fell a sacrifice to liquor. It was unluckily his first
ambition to promote what is usually called Good Fellowship: In this
undertaking he has in a very few years entirely ruined his constitution, and
now stalks up and down in so piteous a condition, as might inspire his
companions with more melan∣choly reflections than an empty bottle. He has quite
lost all appetite; and he is now obliged to keep up a weak arti∣ficial heat
in his body, by the same means that destroyed the natural warmth of his
constitution. Rum, brandy, and us∣quebaugh are his diet-drinks, and he may
perhaps linger a few months, before he falls a martyr to Good Fellowship.</P>
<P><PB N="556" REF="131"/>HAVING thus taken a short view of the
unhappy mo∣tives, that induce men to become hard-drinkers, few perhaps will
think such reasons any recommendation to Drunkenness: nor can I imagine
they will grow more fond of it, by ob∣serving what strange creatures they
are during their intoxi∣cation. <HI>Shakespeare</HI> calls it 
<Q REND="inline">"putting a devil into their mouths to steal
away their brains;"</Q> and indeed a cup too much turns a man the wrong side
out; and wine, at the same time it takes away the power of standing from
the legs, de∣prives the mind of all sense and reflection. It is whimsical
enough to consider the different effects, which wine produces on different
tempers. Sometimes, like love, it makes a fool sensible, and a wise man
an ass; and seems to imbibe a new quality from every different body, as
water takes a tincture from the ground it runs through.</P>
<P>HORACE has with great pleasantry recapitulated the various
effects of wine in a stanza, which I have placed at the head of this paper.
One man grows maudlin and weeps; ano∣ther becomes merry and facetious; a third
quarrels, throws a bottle at his companion's head, and could run his dearest
friend through the body; a fourth is mad for a girl, and falls in love with a
street-walker, or an old woman roasting chesnuts; while to a fifth, the
liquor serves as an opiate, and lulls him to sleep. <HI>Shakespeare</HI>
has also shewn this vari∣ety of characters with great humour.
<HI>Cassio</HI> crys, 
<Q REND="inline">"let's to business,"</Q> and immediately
begins to hiccup out his prayers, and belches out his hopes of salvation:
Justice <HI>Silence,</HI> who does not speak a word while he is sober,
has no sooner swal∣lowed the rouzing cup, than he roars out a catch, and
grows the noisiest man in the company. It is reported to have been one of
the most exquisite entertainments to the <PB N="557" REF="132"/> choice
spirits in the beginning of this century, to get <HI>Addison</HI> and
<HI>Steele</HI> together in company for the evening. <HI>Steele</HI>
enter∣tained them till he was tipsy; when the same wine that stu∣pified
him, only served to elevate <HI>Addison,</HI> who took up the ball just
as <HI>Steele</HI> dropt it, and kept it up for the rest of the evening. They
who have never been present at a scene of this kind may see the whole
group of drunken characters, displayed at one view with infinite humour, in
<HI>Hogarth's Modern Midnight Conversation.</HI></P>
<P>THUS excess of drinking verifies all the transformations
recorded in the fable of <HI>Circe</HI>'s cup; and perhaps the true reason
why <HI>Bacchus</HI> is always painted with horns, is to in∣timate that wine
turns men into beasts. Indeed, if none were to indulge themselves in
drinking, except those who, like <HI>Steele</HI> and <HI>Addison,</HI>
could be witty and agreeable in their cups, the number of hard-drinkers would
be very hap∣pily diminished. Most men have so little right to plead an
excuse of this sort in vindication of their drunkenness, that wine either
makes them very rude, very stupid, or very mad. It is a vulgar error to
suppose that liquor only shews ill qualities, since it also
frequently creates them; and engen∣ders notions in the mind quite foreign to
its natural disposi∣tion, which are the mere effects of wine, and break
out, like blotches and carbuncles on the face. The disgustful appearance,
which most people make when they are drunk, was what induced the
<HI>Spartans</HI> to intoxicate their slaves, and shew them to their
children, in order to deter them from so odious a vice: In like manner let
the Choice Spirit, who is often seen hanging his head over the pot, or
snoring in an armed-chair in a tavern, reflect what a shocking figure he
must have made, when he sees the drunken beggar sleeping on a bulk, or
rolling in the kennel.</P>
<P><PB N="558" REF="133"/>WHOEVER thus considers the motives that
generally in∣duce men to give into these excesses, and how ridiculous and
unhappy they are often rendered by the effects, will hardly be tempted by the
charms of a bottle: and, indeed, Hard-Drinking is frequently one, among the
many evils, that arise from want of education. The dull squire, settled
in the country, who has no taste for literary amusements, has nothing,
except his dogs and horses, but his bumper to divert him: and the town
squire fits soaking for the same reasons in a tavern. These are the
common herd of <HI>Bacchus</HI>'s swine: but nothing is more shocking, than
to see a man of sense thus destroying his parts and constitution. It
not only makes a terrible innovation in his whole frame and intellects; but
also robs him of the society of those like himself, with whom he
should associate, and reduces him to the level of a set of wretches;
since all may be admitted to his com∣pany and conversation, who are able to
toss off a bumper.</P>
<P>THESE considerations are sufficient to convince us of the
evils which result from hard-drinking: but it will shock us still more,
if we reflect how much it will influence our life and conduct. Whoever is
engaged in a profession will never apply to it with success, while he
sticks so close to his bottle; and the tradesman, who endeavours to
make business and plea∣sure compatible, will never be able to make both
ends meet. Thus whether health, fame, or interest is regarded, Drunken∣ness
should be avoided; and we may say with <HI>Cassio,</HI> 
<Q REND="inline">"Every inordinate cup is unblest, and the
ingredient is a Devil."</Q></P>

<DIV2 TYPE="body of issue">
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> CANNOT but admire the ingenious device prefixed to the
advertisements of <HI>Hazard</HI>'s Lottery-Office, in which Fortune is
repre∣sented hovering over the heads of a number of people, and scattering
down all kinds of Prizes among them. What Mr. <HI>Hazard</HI> has here
delineated, every adventurer in the late Lottery had pictured to himself: the
ten thousand constantly floated before his eyes, and each person had
already possessed it in imagination. But alas! all our expectations are
now at an end; the golden dream is at length vanished; and those, who were
kept giddy all the while that the wheel of For∣tune <PB N="560" REF="135"/> was
turning round, have now leisure soberly to reflect on their
disappointment. How many unhappy tradesmen must now trudge on foot all
their lives, who designed to loll in their chariots! how many poor maidens,
of good family but no fortune, must languish all their days with∣out the
comforts of an husband and a coach and fix! Every loser thinks himself
ill used by Fortune: and even Mrs. <HI>Betty,</HI> the possessor of a
single sixteenth, flies to the Office, pays her penny, and receives the
tidings of her ill luck with surprize; goes to another Office, pays her
penny, hears the same disagreeable information, and can hardly, very hardly
persuade herself, that Fortune should have doom∣ed her still to wash
the dishes and scrub down the stairs.</P>
<P>THUS the views of every adventurer are directed to the same
point, though their motives for engaging in the Lot∣tery may be different. One
man puts in, because he is willing to be in Fortune's way; another, because
he had good luck in the last; and another, because he never got any thing
before. This indulges in the prospect of making a fortune, and that buoys
himself up with the hopes of retrieving his desperate circumstances.
Every one, however, thinks himself as sure of the ten thousand, as if he
had it in his pocket; and his only concern is, how to dispose of it. In
this light we may consider every adventurer, as having been in actual
possession of this treasure; and out of fifty thousand people, who
have been blest within this fortnight with such ideal good fortune, I
shall select the fol∣lowing instances, which fell within my own
notice.</P>
<P>JOSEPH WILKINS of <HI>Thames Street</HI> Esquire, Oilman and
Cheesemonger, got the 10,000 l. He could not bear <PB N="561" REF="136"/> the
foggy air and dingy situation of the City: he therefore resolved to take an
house at the St. <HI>James</HI>'s end of the town, and intended to fit up a
snug box at <HI>Hampstead</HI> in the <HI>Chinese</HI> taste, for his
retirement on Sundays. A Chariot was absolutely necessary, to carry him
to and from <HI>'Change</HI> every morning: but he designed to have it made
accord∣ing to the modern fashion, that it might occasionally be con∣verted
into a Post-Chaise, to wheel him on a Saturday night to his Country-seat,
and back again on the Monday morning. Nothing was now wanting but a careful
plod∣ding partner, who should take upon himself the whole drudgery of the
shop; so that the Squire might have no farther trouble than to receive his
dividend of the profits. But while he was considering on whom this important
favour should be conferred, his ticket was drawn—blank: and Squire
<HI>Wilkins</HI> is contented with his greasy employment of measuring out
lamp-oil, and cutting out penny-worths of <HI>Cheshire</HI> Cheese.</P>
<P>JOHN JONES of <HI>Ludlow</HI> in the county of <HI>Salop</HI>
Esquire, Dealer and Chapman, got the 10,000 l. This gentleman was fore-warned
of his success by several undeniable to∣kens. His lady had dreamt of a
<HI>particular Number</HI> four nights together; and while the bells were
ringing upon his being chose Bailiff of the Corporation, they spoke in as
plain words, as ever <HI>Whittington</HI> heard, 
<Q REND="inline">"<HI>Mr. John Jones will get ten thousand
pound—Mr. John Jones will get ten thousand pound.</HI>"</Q> He and his
lady therefore came up to <HI>London:</HI> and not being able to meet with the
<HI>particular Number</HI> at <HI>Hazard</HI>'s or <HI>Wilson</HI>'s or any
other Office always remarkable for selling the ten thousands, they
advertized it <PB N="562" REF="137"/> in the papers, and got the great Prize,
for only paying a guinea more for their ticket than the market-price. As Mrs.
<HI>Jones</HI> knew a good deal of the world, (having lived for some years in
quality of an upper servant in a great house,) she was determined that
Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> should take the opportunity, now they were in town, of
learning how to behave himself as he should do, when he came to his
fortune. She therefore introduced him into the best com∣pany in all the
house-keepers and stewards rooms in the best families, where she was
acquainted: and as Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> was so deficient in politeness, as
not even to know how to make a bow in coming into a room, he had private
lessons from Mr. <HI>Dukes,</HI> who undertakes to teach Grown Gentle∣men
to dance. Mrs. <HI>Jones</HI> herself was very busy in con∣sulting with
the milliner and mantua-maker about the newest fashions, when the long
looked-for ten thousand came up: and directly after the <HI>Hey-Ge-Ho</HI>
carried them down again to <HI>Salop</HI> with this only consolation, that
their ticket was within one of the fortunate Number.</P>
<P>JONATHAN WILDGOOSE of <HI>Cheapside,</HI> Silk Mercer, had too
much taste to be confined to dirty business, which he neglected for the
more agreeable persuits of pleasure. Having therefore met with great
losses in trade, he was obliged to embark the remains of his shattered
fortune in the Lottery, and by purchasing a number of tickets secured to
himself the 10,000 l. He had determined to keep his success secret,
bilk his creditors by becoming bankrupt, turn the whole into an annuity for his
life, and live abroad like a gentleman upon the income. But unluckily his
creditors came upon him too quickly; and before he could know that he had
<HI>not</HI> got the ten thousand, hurried him <PB N="563" REF="138"/> to
jail, where he now lies, lamenting that the <HI>Act of Insol∣vency</HI> was
not postponed 'till after the Lottery.</P>
<P>SIR HUMPHRY OLDCASTLE, having greatly dipt his estate by being
chosen into Parliament on the Tory interest, mortgaged all he had left, to
put himself in the way of the the 10,000l. for the good of his country. This
seasonable recruit fixed him a staunch patriot: and he declared he would
stand another election against all oppositions. But, however it happened,
the finishing of the lottery has induced him to change his sentiments; and
Sir <HI>Humphry</HI> in lieu of the 10,000 l. has accepted a place.</P>
<P>JEMMY LISTER, an Attorney's Clerk, was carried into the Lottery
by pure disinterested love. He had conceived a violent passion for his
master's daughter; but the prudent old gentleman could not be prevailed on to
give her away to an handsome young fellow without a penny. This enra∣ged him
so much, that he was in doubt whether he should bestow his 10,000 l. on
the young lady, or employ it more fashionably in keeping a girl. However, his
hopes soon sunk to one of the 5,000 l. prizes, which he at once deter∣mined
to settle upon her together with his person. But in this too he was
disappointed, as also of the other inferior prizes; and having received a
positive refusal from his mistress, out of mere spite he directly
married the maid.</P>
<P>CAPTAIN MAC MULLEN, a decayed Gamester, made a shift to
purchase the <HI>Chance</HI> of a Ticket, which came up 10,000l. He
immediately flew to <HI>Arthur</HI>'s (late <HI>White</HI>'s,) risked it all
at Hazard, set the whole table, and stript the company of their last
shilling. After this he bought running-horses, made matches, carried off
the best plates, and took in all the Knowing-Ones on the Turf. But so
fluctuating is the situation of a Gamester, that at the end of the Lottery 
<PB N="564" REF="139"/> he found that Fortune had left him in the lurch, without
so much as a groat to buy an halter. 
<Q> 
<L>Et frustrà mortis cupidum, cùm deerit
egenti</L> 
<L>As, laquei pretium,—</L> 
<BIBL>HOR.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>I NEED not point out any particular instances among the other
sex, with respect to their disposal of the 10,000 l. which every lady
had secured by chusing the ticket herself, taking particular care that
the number be an odd one. The married ladies have sufficient calls for even
double this sum, to supply them with the necessaries of dress, and to
answer the expences of frequenting public diversions: and as to the
unmarried ladies, they very well know the truth of that maxim in the ballad,
that 
<Q REND="inline">"in ten thousand pounds ten thousand charms
are center'd."</Q> Some ancient maiden ladies, who could never be brought to
think of an husband, or to give into the vanities of the world, were
resolved to live retired upon their Prize in the country, and leave proofs of
their good dispositions behind them, by swelling out their Wills with a
long list of <HI>Items</HI> to this or that charity or hospital.</P>
<P>BEFORE I conclude, I cannot but take notice of the great
generosity of my own PUBLISHER upon getting the 10,000 l. As his success
was owing to his laying out in the Lottery all the profits, which had already
risen from the publication of this Paper, he had determined to circulate my
future numbers <HI>gratis</HI>; and had even designed to keep open house
for the re∣ception of poor authors. Unhappily for the public, as well as my
brother-writers, Fortune has frustrated his disinterested scheme: Even
I myself am admitted to eat his mutton but once a week; and (instead of
giving away my papers) he has advertised, that the <HI>Twelves</HI> edition
of the CONNOISSEUR will be published on <HI>Tuesday</HI> the 25th of this
instant <HI>No∣vember,</HI> in <HI>Two Pocket Volumes, Price</HI> Six

<DIV2 TYPE="body of issue">
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>S I was going through <HI>Smithfield</HI> the other day, I
observed an old fellow with a wooden leg, drest in a sailor's habit, who
courte∣ously invited the passer-by to peep into his raree-show, for the
small price of an half∣penny. His exhibitions, I found, were very well
suited to the times, and quite in character for himself: for among other
particulars, with which he amused the little audience of children that
surrounded his box, I was mightily pleased to hear the following, 
<Q REND="inline">"—there you see the <HI>British</HI>
fleet persuing the <HI>French</HI> ships, which are running
away—there you see Major-General <HI>Johnson</HI> beating the
<HI>French</HI> soldiers in <HI>America,</HI> and taking Count
<HI>Dieskau</HI> pri∣soner—there you see the <HI>Grand
Monarque,</HI> upon his <PB N="566" REF="141"/> knees before King
<HI>George,</HI> begging his life."</Q> As the thoughts of the public are now
wholly turned upon war, it is no wonder that every method is taken to inspire
us with a love of our country, and an abhorrence of the <HI>French</HI> king:
and not only the old seaman with his raree-show, but the public theatres
have likewise had a view to the same point. At <HI>Drury-Lane</HI> we have
already been enter∣tained with the <HI>Humours of the Navy</HI>; and I am
assured, that at <HI>Covent-Garden</HI> Mr. <HI>Barry</HI> will make an
entire con∣quest of <HI>France</HI> in the person of that renowned hero
<HI>Henry the fifth.</HI> And as the <HI>English</HI> are naturally fond of
bloody exhibitions on the stage, I am told that a new Pantomime, entitled the
<HI>Ohio,</HI> is preparing at this last house, more terrible than any of
it's <HI>Hells, Devils,</HI> and <HI>fiery Dragons;</HI> in which will be
introduced the <HI>Indian Manner of Fighting,</HI> to conclude with a
representation of the Grand <HI>Scalping Dance with all its Horrors.</HI></P>
<P>WHILE this warlike disposition prevails in the nation, I am
under some apprehensions, lest the attention of the public should be
called off from the weighty concerns of these papers. I already perceive,
that the common news∣papers are more eagerly snatched up in the public
coffee-houses than my essays; and the <HI>Gazette</HI> is much oftener
called for than the <HI>Connoisseur.</HI> For these reasons I find it
necessary to lay open my own importance before the public, to shew that I
myself am acting (as it were) in a military capacity, and that
Censor-General TOWN has done his country no less service as a valiant and
skilful com∣mander at home, than Major-General <HI>Johnson</HI> in
<HI>America.</HI> Authors may very properly be said to be engaged in a
state of literary warfare; many of whom are taken into <PB N="567" REF="142"/>
pay by those great and mighty potentates the booksellers: and it will be
allowed, that they undergo no less hardships in the service, than the
common soldiers who are contented to be shot at for a groat a day.</P>
<P>IT has been my province to repell the daily inroads and
encroachments made by vice and folly, and to guard the nation from an
invasion of foreign fopperies and <HI>French</HI> fashions. The town has
been principally the scene of action; where I have found enemies to encounter
with, no less formidable than the <HI>Tquattotquaws</HI> or the
<HI>Chickchimuckchis</HI> of <HI>North-America.</HI> But as the curiosity of
the public is so much engaged in attending to the enterprizes of Old
<HI>Hendrick</HI> the <HI>Sachem,</HI> and the incursions of <HI>Indians</HI>
who have taken up the hatchet against our Colonies, I am afraid that my
exploits against the Savages, which infest this metropolis, will be wholly
over-looked. I have therefore resolved to give my readers fresh advices
from time to time of what passes here, drawn up in the same warlike
stile and manner as those very alarming articles of news, which are
commonly to be met with in our public papers.</P>
<P>WE hear from <HI>White</HI>'s, that the forces under Major
General <HI>Hoyle,</HI> which used to encamp at that place, are removed from
thence, and have fixed their winter quarters at <HI>Arthur</HI>'s. The same
letters say, that an obstinate engage∣ment was fought there a few nights
ago, in which one party gained a great booty, and the other suffered a
consi∣derable loss. We are also informed, that an epidemical distemper
rages among them, and that several of the chiefs have been carried off by a
sudden death.</P>
<P><PB N="568" REF="143"/>THEY write from <HI>Covent-Garden,</HI>
that last week a Body of <HI>Irregulars</HI> sallied out at midnight,
stormed several forts in that neighbourhood, and committed great outrages;
but being attacked by a detachment from the allied army of watchmen,
constables, and justices, they were put to flight, and several of them
taken prisoners. The plague still rages there with great violence, as well
as in the neigh∣bouring territories of <HI>Drury.</HI></P>
<P>WE hear from the same place, that the <HI>Company</HI>
com∣manded by Brigadier <HI>Rich</HI> has been reinforced with several
new-raised recruits to supply the place of some deserters, who had gone
over to the enemy: but his chief dependance is on the light-armed troops, which
are very active, and are distinguished, like the <HI>Highlanders,</HI> by
their party-coloured dress. The enemy, on the other hand, have taken
several <HI>Swiss</HI> and <HI>Germans</HI> into pay; though they were at
first under terrible apprehensions of their being set upon by the
<HI>Critics.</HI> These are a rude, ignorant, savage people, who are always
at war with the nation of <HI>Authors.</HI> Their constant manner of fighting
is to begin the onset with strange hissings and noises, accompanied
with an horrid instrument, named the <HI>Cat-call</HI>; which, like the
<HI>War-hoop</HI> of the <HI>Indians,</HI> has struck a panic into the hearts
of the stoutest heroes.</P>
<P>WE have advice from the <HI>Butcher Row,</HI> that on monday
night last the <HI>Infidels</HI> held a grand Council of war at their head
quarters in the <HI>Robin Hood,</HI> at which their good friend and ally, the
<HI>Mufti</HI> of <HI>Clare-market,</HI> assisted in person. After many
debates, they resolved to declare war against the <HI>Christians,</HI>
and never to make peace, till they had pulled <PB N="569" REF="144"/> down all
the Churches in <HI>Christendom,</HI> and established the
<HI>Alcoran</HI> of <HI>Bolingbroke</HI> in lieu of the Bible.</P>
<P>ALL our advices from the City of <HI>London</HI> agree in their
accounts of the great havock and slaughter made there on the Festival,
commonly called <HI>My Lord Mayor's Day.</HI> All the <HI>Companies</HI> in
their black uniform, and the trained bands in their regimentals, made a general
forage. They carried off vast quantities of chickens, geese, ducks, and all
kinds of provisions. Major <HI>Guzzledown</HI> of <HI>Bassishaw</HI>
distinguished himself greatly, having with sword in hand gallantly
attacked the out-works, scaled the walls, mounted the ramparts, and forced
through the covert-way of a large fortified Custard, which seemed
impregnable.</P>
<P>THE Inhabitants of <HI>Sussex</HI> have lately been alarmed
with the apprehensions of an Invasion; as the <HI>French</HI> have been
very busy in fitting out several small vessels laden with stores of
wine and brandy, with which it is thought they will attempt to make a descent
somewhere on our coasts. The Independant Companies of <HI>Smugglers</HI> in
the service of <HI>France</HI> are to be sent on this expedition: but if
the fleet of Custom-house smacks, &amp;c. do not intercept them at sea,
we are preparing to receive them as soon as they are landed.</P>
<P>FROM divers parts of the country we have advice, that the roads
are every where crowded with Ladies, who (not∣withstanding the severity of
the weather) are hurrying up to <HI>London,</HI> to be present at the meeting
of the <HI>Female Parli∣ament.</HI> At this critical juncture the fate of the
nation de∣pends entirely on the deliberations of this wise and august
Assembly: and as there are known to be many disinterested 
<PB N="570" REF="145"/> patriots in the House, it is not to be doubted but
that proper measures will be persued for the good of their country. Many

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>S every marriage is a kind of family festival, the
wedding-day is honoured with various celebrities, and distinguished like
the fifth of <HI>November,</HI> the birth-days of the Royal Family, or any
other public day, with many demonstrations of joy: The happy couple are
drest in their richest suits, the bells ring all day, and the evening is
con∣cluded with the merry ceremony of throwing the Stocking. But these
festivities are not always so religiously observed in Town, where many
a pair of quality are tacked together with the utmost privacy, and
immediately after sneak out of town, as if they were ashamed to shew
their faces after what they had done. In the Country, when the squire, or 
<PB N="572" REF="147"/> any other person of distinction is married, the
Honey-Moon is almost a continued Carnival: and every marriage is ac∣counted
more or less likely to be prosperous, in proportion to the number of deer,
oxen, and sheep, that are killed on the occasion, and the hogsheads of
wine and tuns of ale, with which they are washed down. By the last post I
received an account from my Cousin VILLAGE, of the wedding of a near
relation, with a particular detail of the magnificence of the entertainment,
the splendor of the ball, and the uni∣versal joy of the whole manour. At
the same time I received compliments from the new-married couple, with a
large slice of the BRIDE-CAKE; the virtues of which are well known to every
girl of thirteen. I was never in pos∣session of this nuptial charm
before: but I was so much delighted with this matrimonial token, and it
excited in my mind so many reflections on conjugal happiness, that (though
I did not lay it under my pillow,) it gave oc∣casion to the following
Dream.</P>
<P>I FOUND myself in the middle of a spacious building, which
was crouded with a variety of persons of both sexes; and upon enquiry was
told, that it was the Temple of the God of Marriage; and that every one who had
an incli∣nation to sacrifice to that Deity, was invited to approach a large
altar which was covered with a great number of CAKES of different shapes and
appearance. Some of these were moulded into the form of hearts; and others
were woven into true-lovers-knots: some were strewed with sugar, and
stuck about with sweet-meats; some were covered with gold; some were
stamped with coronets; and others had their tops embellished with
glittering toys, that represented a fine house, a set of jewels, a coach
and <PB N="573" REF="148"/> six or the like. <HI>Plutus</HI> and
<HI>Cupid</HI> were busily employed in distributing these Cakes (which
were all of them marked with the word MATRIMONY, and called BRIDE-CAKES) to
different persons, who were allowed to chuse for them∣selves, according
to their different views and inclinations.</P>
<P>I OBSERVED several hasten to the altar, who all appeared to
be differently affected by their choice. To some the Cakes seemed of so
delicious a flavour, that they imagined they should never be surfeited;
while others who found the taste very agreeable at first, in a short time
declared it to be flat and insipid: However, I could not help remark∣ing,
that many more (particularly among the quality) ad∣dressed themselves to
<HI>Plutus,</HI> than to <HI>Cupid.</HI></P>
<P>BEING desirous to take a nearer view of the company, I
pushed through the croud, and placed myself close by the altar. A young
couple now advanced, and applying to <HI>Cupid,</HI> desired him to reach
them one of the Cakes, in the shape of a double heart pearced through with
darts; but just as they were going to share it betwixt them, a crabbed old
fellow, whom I found to be the girl's father, stepped up, broke the cake in
two, and obliged the young lady to fix upon another which <HI>Plutus</HI>
picked out for her, and which represented the figure of a fine gentleman in
gilt ginger-bread.</P>
<P>AN old fellow of sixty-two, who had stolen one day from the
business of the <HI>'Change</HI> and the <HI>Alley,</HI> next came towards
the altar, and seemed to express a strong desire for a Cake.
<HI>Plutus,</HI> who recollected him at first sight, immedi∣ately offered
him one, which, though very mouldy and <PB N="574" REF="149"/> coarse, was
gilt all over; but he was astonished at the old gentleman's refusing it,
and petitioning <HI>Cupid</HI> for a Cake of the most elegant form and
sweetest ingredients of any on the altar. The little God at first
repulsed him with indig∣nation, but afterwards <HI>sold</HI> it to him for
a large sum of money; a circumstance which amazed me beyond
expres∣sion, but which I soon found was very commonly practised in this
Temple. The old fellow retired with his purchased prize: and though I
imagined he might still have a colt's tooth remaining, after having for
some time mumbled it be∣tween his old gums in vain, it lay by him untouched
and unenjoyed.</P>
<P>I WAS afterwards very much disgusted with the many
instances that occurred, of these delicate morsels being set up to
sale: and I found, that their price rose and fell, like that of beef or
mutton, according to the glut or scarcity of the market. I was particularly
affected with the disposal of the two following. A young gentleman and lady
were ap∣proaching the altar, and had agreed to take between them a Cake of a
plain form but delicious flavour, marked <HI>Love and Competence</HI>; but a
person of quality stepping forward persuaded the false female to join
with him, and receive from <HI>Plutus</HI> a glittering dainty, marked
<HI>Indifference and a large Settlement.</HI> Another lady was coming up with a
Knight of the Bath, being tempted by a Cake with a red ribbon streaming from
it, like the flags on a Twelfth-Cake; but was prevailed on by a person of
greater rank and dis∣tinction to accept a more showy Cake, adorned with a
blue ribbon and a coronet.</P>
<P>A BUXOM dame of an amourous complexion came next, and begged
very hard for a Cake. She had before received <PB N="575" REF="150"/> several
which suited her tooth, and pleased her palate so excessively, that
as soon as she had dispatched one, she constantly came to
<HI>Cupid</HI> for another. She now seized her Cake with great transport,
and retiring to a corner with it, I could discern her greedily mumbling the
delicious morsel, though she had fairly worn out six and twenty of her
teeth in the service. After this an ancient lady came tottering up to the
altar, supported by a young fellow in a red coat with a shoulder-knot.
<HI>Plutus</HI> gave him a stale Cake marked with the word JOINTURE in large
golden capitals, which he received with some reluctance, while the old lady
eagerly snatched another from <HI>Cupid,</HI> (who turned his head aside
from her,) on which I could plainly discover the word DOTAGE.</P>
<P>A RICH rusty batchelor of the last century then came
bustling through the croud. He brought with him a red∣cheeked country girl of
nineteen. As he approached the altar, he met several coming from it with
Cakes, which he had refused: some of which were marked <HI>Riches,</HI>
some <HI>Family,</HI> some <HI>Beauty,</HI> and one or two
<HI>Affection.</HI> The girl he brought with him proved to be his dairy-maid,
whom he had for some time past been in vain attempting to bring over to his
wishes; but at last finding his design impracticable, he came with her to
the altar. He seemed, indeed, a little ashamed of his undertaking, and
betrayed a good deal of aukwardness in his manner and deportment. However, as
soon as he had taken his Cake, he retired; and determined to spend the
rest of his days with his milch-cow in the country.</P>
<P>TO satisfy a modest longing, there now advanced a mai∣den
lady in the bloom of threescore. She had, it seems, heretofore refused
several offers from <HI>Cupid</HI> and <HI>Plutus</HI>; but 
<PB N="576" REF="151"/> being enraged to find, that they had now given over all
thoughts of her, she seized by the hand a young Ensign of the Guards, and
carried him to the altar, whence she her∣self snatched up a Cake, and
divided it with her gallant. She was highly delighted with the taste of it at
first, but her partner being very soon cloyed, she too late discovered
that the half which she held in her hand was signed <HI>Folly,</HI> and
that which she had forced upon her paramour was marked
<HI>Aversion.</HI></P>
<P>A LITTLE, pert, forward Miss in a frock and hanging sleeves
briskly ran up to <HI>Cupid,</HI> and begged for a Cake: what it was she
did not care; but a Cake she must and would have, of one kind or another.
She had just stretched out her hand to receive one from <HI>Cupid,</HI>
when her mamma interposed, sent the child back again blubbering to the
boarding-school, and carried off the Cake herself.</P>
<P>AN old woman, fantastically drest, then burst into the
Temple, and run raving up to the altar, crying out that her name was MARY
SINGLETON, and she would have an hus∣band. But the poor lady seemed
likely to be disappointed; for as she could prevail on no one to join hands
with her, both <HI>Cupid</HI> and <HI>Plutus</HI> refused to favour her with
a Cake. Furious with rage and despair, she snatched one off the altar;
and seizing on the first man that came in her way, (which unfortunately
happened to be myself,) she would have crammed it forcibly down my throat.
As the least crumb of it was as disagreeable as a drench to an horse, I
began to spawl and sputter and keck; and though the flurry of spirits,
which it occasioned, awaked me, I thought I had the nauseous taste of it
still in my mouth.</P>

<HEAD>To Mr. TOWN.</HEAD>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>MONG the many <HI>Register Offices</HI> erected within
these few years past, I am surprized that no scheme of the like nature
has been thought of for the service of literature; and that no place has been
set apart, where Literary Commodities of every sort might be disposed
of; where men of learning might meet with employment, and where others, who
want their assistance, might be sure to <PB N="578" REF="153"/> meet
with men of learning. There is nothing of this kind in being at present,
except among the booksellers; who have made a monopoly of the trade, and
engrossed the whole market to themselves. To remedy this inconvenience,
my design is to set up a LITERARY REGISTER OFFICE: for which purpose I
intend to hire the now useless theatre in <HI>Lincolns Inn Fields,</HI> and
convert it into a mart for the staple commodities of the literary
commonwealth. I shall here fit up apartments for the reception of my authors,
who will be employed from time to time in supplying the public with the
requisite manufactures. This scheme, will, I doubt not, meet with great
encouragement, as it is of general utility: and I do not remember any design
of the same nature, except at a barber's on the other side the water, who
has hung out a board over his shop with the following
in∣scription—<HI>Letters read and written for Servants and
others.</HI></P>
<P>I SHALL always have a fresh assortment of goods in the
best taste and newest fashion: as of Novels for example, while the
humour of reading them is prevalent among all ranks of people. For this branch
I shall retain a very emi∣nent master-novellist, to cut out adventures
and intrigues; and shall employ a proper number of hands to finish the work
with all possible care and expedition: and if any ladies of quality, or
others, chuse to furnish their own materials for Memoirs and Apologies,
they may have them done up, and be fitted exactly, at my Office. Besides
several others, which my men shall get up with the greatest dispatch, I
can assure you I have myself worked night and day, and have already
finished six and thirty sheets of the History of Miss <HI>Sukey
Sapling,</HI> Written by Herself.</P>
<P><PB N="579" REF="154"/>PAMPHLETS of all sorts shall be
composed, whenever any popular subject starts up, that is likely to
engage the attention of the public. Every new play shall be followed by an
<HI>Examen</HI> or <HI>Remarks:</HI> all riots at either play-house will
afford scope for <HI>Letters to the Managers</HI>; and every new actor or
actress produce theatrical criticisms. Poetry, you know, Mr. TOWN, is a
mere drug; but I shall always have a number of ready-made Odes by me, which
may be suited to any Great Man, dead or alive, in place or out of place. I
shall also have a large bundle of <HI>Poems on several Occasions,</HI>
very proper for any gentleman or lady, who chuses to publish by
subscription; besides a more ordinary sort of Hymns to the Morning,
Verses on the Death of —, Odes to Miss <HI>A. B. C.</HI> Acrostics
and Re∣busses, for the use of the Magazines: to be sold a penny∣worth,
with allowance to those who take a great quantity.</P>
<P>WITH regard to Law matters, as they have no sort of
connexion with wit or learning, I shall not concern myself with their
unintelligible jargon; nor presume to interfere with those authors in
parchment, who measure their words by the foot-rule, and sell their
writings at so much <HI>per</HI> line. How∣ever, I shall furnish young
Students of the several Inns of Court with complete Canons of Criticism,
and Opinions on any new theatrical Cases; on which they may argue very
learnedly at a tavern, or plead at the bar of a coffee-house. For Medical
subjects, I shall procure a learned Graduate by <HI>Diploma</HI> from
abroad, whose practice will not so much take up his time as to prevent his
being at leisure to write oc∣casional treatises, setting forth the
virtues of any newly-invented Powder, or newly-discovered Water. He shall
also draw up the advertisements for medicines, that remove 
<PB N="580" REF="155"/> all diseases, and are never known to fail; he
shall compile the wonderful accounts of their surprising cures; and
fur∣nish cases that never happened, and affidavits that were never made.
With respect to Divinity, as I have reason to believe that controversial
writings will be often called for, I intend to bargain with the <HI>Robin
Hood</HI> Society to undertake in the lump to furnish my Office with Defences
of Lord <HI>Bo∣lingbroke,</HI> &amp;c. and till I can procure some poor
curate out of the country, or servitor from the university, to write the
<HI>Manuscript Sermons of eminent Divines lately deceased, war∣ranted
originals,</HI> I must make shift with the <HI>Fleet Parsons</HI> now out
of business.</P>
<P>THOUGH I shall not keep any dramatic works ready made by me,
(as these commodities are apt to grow stale and out of fashion,) yet
either of the theatres may be served with tragedy, comedy, farce, or the
like, by bespeaking them, and giving but three days notice. For the comic
pieces I shall employ a poet, who has long worked for the drolls at
<HI>Bar∣tholomew</HI> and <HI>Southwark</HI> fairs, and has printed a comedy as
it was <HI>half</HI> acted at <HI>Drury-Lane.</HI> My tragedies will be
furnished by a <HI>North Briton,</HI> who walked up to <HI>London</HI> from
his native country last winter with a most sublime tragedy in his
coat-pocket, and which is now to be disposed of to the best bidder. Any
old play of <HI>Shakespeare</HI> or <HI>Ben Johnson</HI> shall be pieced
with modern ones according to the present taste, or cut out in airs and
recitative for an <HI>English Opera.</HI> Rhymes for Pantomimes may be had,
to be set to the clack of a mill, the tinkling of a tin cascade, or the
slaps of <HI>Harlequin</HI>'s wooden sword. The proprietors of our public
Gardens, during the summer season, may be also <PB N="581" REF="156"/>
supplied from my Office with Love-Songs to a new burthen, or comic Dialogues
in <HI>Crambo</HI>; and words shall, at any time be fitted to the music,
after the tunes are composed.</P>
<P>AS I propose to make my Office of general utility, every
thing that bears the least affinity to literature will be natu∣rally
comprehended in my Scheme. Members of Parliament may be supplied with
Speeches on any political subject; and Country Justices may, on directing a
letter to the Office post paid, have Charges to the Jury at the Quarter
Sessions sent down to them by the first coach or waggon. Addresses
on particular occasions shall be drawn up for the worshipful mayor and
aldermen of any city or corporation: Laws, Rules, Regulations, or Orders,
shall be formed for the <HI>Anti-Gallicans, Ubiquarians, Gregorians,</HI> or
any private clubs and societies. <HI>N. B.</HI> The <HI>Free Masons</HI>
may depend upon secresy.</P>
<P>MANY advantages may likewise accrue to the polite world from
the establishment of my Office. Gentlemen and ladies may have
<HI>Billet-doaux</HI> written for them with the most soft and languishing
expressions: Message Cards, and Invitations to Routs, shall be filled
up and cir∣culated at so much <HI>per</HI> hundred, or undertaken in the
gross at a fixed price all the year round. Beaux may be accommodated with
letters of gallantry to send to their laundresses, or have them copied
out in a fashionable female scrawl, and directed to themselves; which
they may shew about as coming from ladies of quality in love with them.
Gentlemen who love fighting, but cannot write, may have challenges pen'd for
them in the true stile and spirit of a modern Blood.</P>
<P><PB N="582" REF="157"/>THERE are many other conveniencies
arising from such an Office, which it would be too tedious to enume∣rate:
and it will be found to be no less beneficial to you authors, Mr. TOWN, than
those other <HI>Register Offices</HI> are to men and maid-servants. If an
author (for example) wants employment, or is out of place, he has nothing to do
but to enter his name with me, and I shall presently get him work: or if a
bookseller wants an hand for any particular job, (as a
translation-spinner, a novel-weaver, a play-wright, a verse-turner, or
the like) upon searching my books he will be sure to meet with a man fit
for the business. In short, any composition, in prose or rhyme, and
on any subject, may be procured at a minute's warning, by ap∣plying to my
Office: and I dare say, you yourself, Mr. TOWN, will be very glad now and
then to purchase a <HI>Con∣noisseur</HI> of me, whenever the idle fit
seizes you. If that should happen to come upon you this week, and you have
nothing better, you will oblige me by laying the scheme here sent before
your readers; and in return, you shall have the credit of publishing your
papers at my Office, as soon as it is opened, and welcome.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<DIV2 TYPE="body of issue">
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> REMEMBER to have heard a cousin of mine, who was formerly
at <HI>Cambridge,</HI> often men∣tion a sect of Philosophers
distinguished by the rest of the collegians by the appellation of
<HI>Tuft-Hunters.</HI> These were not the disciples of the <HI>Stoics</HI>
or <HI>Epicureans,</HI> or the advocates for the old or new philosophy, but
the followers, literally speaking, of the fellow-commoners, noblemen, and
other rich students, whom, it seems, the courtesy of the Univer∣sity
has honoured with a cap adorned with a gold tossel. These few gold
threads have almost as much influence in the University as a red or blue
ribband at court, and always draw after the wearer a train of humble
companions, who <PB N="584" REF="159"/> will be at his call to breakfast,
dine, or sup with him whenever he pleases, will go with him any where,
drink with him, wench with him, borrow his money, or let him pay their
reckoning. They are, I am told, a sort of disease of the place, which a
man of fortune is sure to catch as soon as he arrives there: and these
fast friends stick so close to him, that he can never shake them off,
while he keeps his gown on his back.</P>
<P>THE University of <HI>London</HI> is not without its
<HI>Tuft-Hunters,</HI> who fasten, like leeches, on a young man of fortune at
his first coming to town. They beset him as soon as he arrives, and when
they have once surrounded him, seldom fail of se∣curing him to
themselves; for no persons of character care to have any connections with
him, when he has been fre∣quently seen in such bad company. It is a great
misfortune for any young gentleman to fall into their hands: though indeed, as
a fool is the natural prey of knaves, the wealthy maintainers of this
fraternity are generally none of the wi∣sest: And as at the University, 
<Q REND="inline">"where the learned pate ducks to the golden
fool,"</Q> the gentleman-student is distinguished by a cap with a gold
tuft, I always consider these sons of folly in town as adorned with a
showy cap hung with bells, which serve at once to denote the depth of their
parts, and to call their train about them.</P>
<P>THE dialect of the town has very expressively
charac∣terised these humble dependants on men of fortune by the name of
<HI>Hangers-on.</HI> They will, indeed, take such sure hold, and hang on a
man so constantly, that it is almost im∣possible to drop them.
Whenever the gentleman appears, the <HI>Hanger-on</HI> is sure to be at his
elbow. They will squeeze <PB N="585" REF="160"/> themselves into every party
that is formed; and I have known instances of their thrusting themselves
into strange families, by sticking to their patron's skirts, and
impu∣dently introducing themselves where he has been invited to dinner:
which, indeed, I think would not be an im∣proper custom, provided they would
submit to stand behind his chair. They will stick so closely, that
all the adhesive quality of burs, pitch, &amp;c. seem to be collected in
them; and the line in <HI>Pope</HI>'s <HI>Odyssey,</HI> so often
ridiculed, may rather be considered as emphasis than tautology in
speaking of Them. The <HI>Hanger-on</HI> clings to his fool, as
<HI>Ulysses</HI> did to the rock, and in <HI>Pope</HI>'s words, 
<Q> 
<L>They STICK ADHERENT, and SUSPENDED HANG.</L></Q></P>
<P>THE tenaciousness of a <HI>Hanger-on</HI> is so very
strong, that whoever is drawn into their snares, is so firmly limed he
can hardly ever loose himself from them. For as nothing but the lowest
meanness of spirit could ever prevail on a man to submit to such
dependance on another, it is in vain to think of getting rid of such abject
wretches by treating them with contempt. They will take as much beating,
provided you will allow them an equal degree of familiarity, as a spaniel.
They will also submit to do any little offices, and are glad to make
themselves useful, whenever they have an opportunity. They will go among
the brokers to borrow money for you, pimp for you, or submit to any other
such gentleman-like employment to serve their friend.</P>
<P>IT must here be noted, that every <HI>Hanger-on</HI> is a
person of strict honour and a gentleman; for though his fortune is (to be
sure) somewhat inferior to yours, and he submits to <PB N="586" REF="161"/> make himself convenient on several occasions, yet on that
account you are indebted to his infinite good-nature; and all his endeavours to
serve you proceed from his great friend∣ship and regard for you. I remember
one of these friendly gentlemen, who carried his esteem so far, that in a
quarrel with his rich companion, in which he was favoured with several tweaks
by the nose and kicks on the breech, he received all these injuries with
patience, and only said with tears in his eyes, 
<Q REND="inline">"Dear <HI>Jack,</HI> I never expected this
usage from you. You know I don't mind fighting; but I should never have a
moment's peace, if I was to do you the least injury. Come, <HI>Jack,</HI> let
us buss and be friends."</Q> Their gentility is unquestionable, for they
are seldom of any trade, though they are sometimes (being younger-brothers
perhaps) of a profession. I know one, who is a nominal lawyer; but though
his friend has often fee'd him, our Counsellor could never with any propriety
con∣sider him as a client; and I know another, who (like <HI>Gibbet</HI> in
the play) is called Captain, whose elegant manner of living must be
supported by his being on full pay with his patron, since he does not
receive even the common soldier's groat a day from his commission.
However, con∣sidering at one view the gentility of their profession, and
the shortness of their finances, I often look on them as a band of decayed
gentlemen, the honourable pensioners of those they follow. The great men
among the <HI>Romans</HI> had a number of these <HI>Hangers-on,</HI> which
attended them where-ever they went, and were emphatically called
<HI>Umbrae,</HI> or <HI>Shadows</HI>; and, indeed, this appellation conveys a
very full idea of the nature of these humble retainers to the wealthy,
since they not only follow them like their shadows, but 
<Q REND="inline">"like a shadow prove the substance
true:"</Q> for whenever <PB N="587" REF="162"/> you observe one or more of
these <HI>Umbrae</HI> perpetually at the heels of any gentleman, you may
fairly conclude him to be a man of fortune.</P>
<P>THESE faithful friends are so careful of every thing that
concerns you, that they always enquire with the greatest exactness into
your affairs, and know almost as well as your steward the income of your
estate. They are also so fond of your company, and so desirous of
preserving your good opi∣nion, that a <HI>Hanger-on</HI> will take as much
pains to keep you entirely to himself, and to prevent a rival in your
af∣fections, as a mistress: and as a convenient female is a very
necessary part of the equipage of a person of fashion, these male
companions must be a very agreeable part of the retinue of those
high-spirited young gentlemen, who are fond of being the head of their
company. It is only a more refined taste in expence to pay a man for laughing
at your wit, and in∣dulging your humour: and who will either drink his bottle
with you at the tavern, or run to the end of the town for you on an errand.</P>
<P>I MIGHT also take notice of an humbler sort of
<HI>Hangers-on,</HI> who fix themselves to no one particular, but fasten
upon all their friends in their turns. Their views, indeed, are seldom
extended beyond a present subsistence, and their utmost aim perhaps
is to get a dinner. For this purpose they keep a register of the hours of
dining of all their acquaintance; and though they contrive to call in upon you
just as you are sitting down to table, they are always with much difficulty
prevailed upon to take a chair. If you dine abroad, or are gone into the
country, they will eat with your family to prevent their being melancholy on
account <PB N="588" REF="163"/> of your absence; or if your family is out,
they will break∣fast, dine, and sup with you out of charity, because you
should not be alone. Every house is haunted with these disturbers of
our meals: and perhaps the best way to get rid of them, would be to put them,
with the rest of your servants, upon board-wages.</P>
<P>BUT besides these danglers after men of fortune, and
in∣truders on your table in town, the country breeds a race of lowly retainers,
which may properly be ranked among the same species. Almost every family
supports a poor kinsman, who happening to be no way related to the
estate, was too proud of his blood to apply himself in his youth to any
profession, and rather chose to be supported in laziness at the
family-seat. They are, indeed, known perhaps to be cou∣sins to the
squire, but do not appear in a more creditable light than his servants out
of livery; and sometimes actually submit to as mean offices of drudgery as
the groom or whipper-in. The whole fraternity of <HI>Hangers-on,</HI> whether
in town or country, or under whatever denomination, are the sons of
idleness: for it will be found upon examina∣tion, that whenever a man,
whose bread depends on his industry, gives himself up to indolence, he
becomes capable of any meanness whatever: and if <HI>they cannot dig,</HI>
yet like our <HI>Hangers-on, to beg they are not ashamed.</HI></P>

<LETTER>
<HEAD>To Mr. TOWN.</HEAD>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>SIR!</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> HAVE been some years married to one of the best women
in the world. She possesses all the virtues that can be named: but
alas! she possesses some of them to excess. Those which I
wish to particularize, and which are infinitely pernicious to me, and my
fortunes, are her superabundant Good-nature, and her boundless
Generosity.</P>
<P>IT is a little difficult perhaps to ascertain what are, or
ought to be, the exact bounds of Good-nature; which, of all virtues, seems to
me most necessary to be confined, or at least mitigated in such a
manner, as to hinder it from de∣stroying <PB N="590" REF="165"/> its own
excellence and utility. On the one hand, if it is restrained too close, the
world will say, that it must entirely lose its essence: But fatal
experience has convinced me, that if it is permitted to enjoy a full unlimited
sway, this amiable virtue becomes a ridiculous vice; and brings with it, as
in my wife's case, fruitless expences, ill-judged concessions, and a
kind of blind folly, that is always liable to contempt.</P>
<P>GENEROSITY is the daughter of Good-nature. She is very fair
and lovely when under the tuition of Judgment and Reason; but when she
escapes from her tutors, and acts in∣discriminately, according as her fancy
allures her, she subjects herself, like her mother, to the blasts of
sneer, ridicule, and disdain.</P>
<P>TO illustrate these assertions by some examples,
from among the many mishaps, losses, and embarassments, which have
accrued to us in the course of our domestic affairs, give me leave to tell
you, that some years ago, we had a footboy who acted as butler, and had the
custody of all the little plate which our small fortune could afford us.
The fellow was aukward, and unfit for the station; but my wife very
good-naturedly was determined to keep him in our ser∣vice, because he
intended to marry the nursery-maid, and would undoubtedly make an excellent
husband. The rascal was a thief; but as it is ill-natured to suspect
people, before we have full proof of their knavery, several of his tricks,
and petty larcenies, were attributed to the itinerant Jews and higlers (we then
living at <HI>Newington)</HI> who frequently called at our door. Flushed with
success, and relying on my wife's credulity and Good-nature, he began to
form deeper designs; and (as he lay in the kitchen) pretended to have seen
a man breaking in at the window, and to have hid himself with a chopping
knife in his hand, so as to have felled the villain to the ground as soon
as he had put his body through the case∣ment. <PB N="591" REF="166"/> A
noise from without was said to have given an alarm to the housebreaker,
and to have interrupted him in his at∣tempt; but some whole panes of glass
being dislocated from their lead, and some hacks and scratches of a
chisel (marks all made by our own servant) being visible next morning, my
wife very generously <HI>rewarded</HI> her <HI>Jemmy,</HI> whom she
jocularly called <HI>Scrub,</HI> for his diligence and courage in defending us
from having our throats cut. This terrible tale was doubtless formed in order
to remove all suspicions, when he should pillage the house himself;
but precautions being taken by us, in consequence of this alarm, to fortify
our bed-chamber, where he knew our current treasure was reposited,
<HI>Jemmy</HI> thought it time to decamp; so that in about a week after he
had received the reward, I hinted at, of a crown piece from his lady, he
stole her gold repeating watch, and a pair of our best silver
candlesticks, with which he voluntarily tran∣sported himself, as we have
been since told, to the <HI>West-In∣dies,</HI> leaving his mistress the
nursery-maid, big with child, and thereby giving great licence to the
neighbourhood to animadvert upon my wife's amazing prescience in foreseeing
his excellencies as an husband.</P>
<P>YOU must further be told, Sir, that my dear consort, in
the full glow of her goodness, is never contented unless her servants
marry each other. All I can urge against so impo∣litic a custom has been
to no purpose: Marriage (she says) prevents vice, and saves souls
from destruction. Perhaps it may; but are no unmarried servants to be found
in Mr. <HI>Fielding</HI>'s Register Office, or elsewhere, but what are
vicious? At least I am sure, that this piece of sanctity is very
expensive in its effects, and is attended with many inconve∣niences. One of
her maids about two years ago was disco∣vered to be very intimate with my
footman; my wife, to prevent ill consequences, hastened to have them
married, and was present herself at the ceremony. She admired the
mo∣desty of the woman and the decent gravity of the man during 
<PB N="592" REF="167"/> the holy rites, and she was entirely convinced that no
harm could have happened from so decent a couple. In little more than three
months after the marriage, <HI>Patty</HI> brought forth a swinging girl; but
as it was born almost six months before its time, my wife advised them to
keep it the remain∣ing half year in cotton. She did this purely from a motive
of good-nature, to try to shield the new married woman's re∣putation; but
finding our neighbours fleer at the incident, and smile contemptuously at
the prescription of cotton, she contented herself in believing
<HI>Patty</HI>'s own account, that 
<Q REND="inline">"in truth she had been married eight months
before by a <HI>Fleet-parson,</HI> but was afraid to own it."</Q></P>
<P>BUT if my wife's indulging her domestics in matrimony was
productive of no other ill consequence than merely their being married, it
might indeed sometimes rather prove a bene∣fit than a detriment: but the
chaster and more sober they have been before marriage, the greater number
of children are pro∣duced in matrimony; and my wife looks upon herself as in
duty obliged to take care of the poor helpless offspring, that have been
begotten under her own roof; so that I assure you, Sir, my house is
so well filled with children, that it would put you immediately in mind of
the <HI>Foundling Hos∣pital</HI>; with this difference however, that in
<HI>my Hospital</HI> not only the children are provided for, whether
bastards or legi∣timate, but also the fathers and mothers.</P>
<P>YOUR high office, Mr. CENSOR, requires and leads you to hear
domestic occurrences, otherwise I should scarce have troubled you with
the records of a private family, almost ruined by excrescencies of virtue.
The same overflowing humanity runs through the whole conduct of the dear
wo∣man whom I have mentioned. Even in trifles she is full of works of
supererogation. Our doors are perpetually sur∣rounded with beggars, where
the halt, the maimed and the blind assemble in as great numbers, as at the
door of the <PB N="593" REF="168"/> <HI>Roman</HI> Catholic Chapel in
<HI>Lincoln's Inn-Fields.</HI> She not only gives them money, but sends them
out great quantities of bread, beer, and cold victuals; and she has her
different <HI>pensioners</HI> (as she herself calls them) for every day
in the week. But the expence attending these out-door petitioners (many of
whom have from time to time been discovered to be im∣postors) is nothing in
comparison to the sums that are almost daily drawn from her by begging
letters. It is impossible to imagine a calamity, by which she has not
been a sufferer, in relieving those who have extorted money from her, by
pretended misfortunes. The poor lady has been much hurt by losses in trade,
has been a great sufferer by fire, under∣gone many hardships from
sickness and other unforeseen ac∣cidents, and it was but yesterday that
she paid a long apothe∣cary's bill brought on by a violent fever. Thus, Sir,
though my wife goes into but little company, and the family-expences are to all
appearance very small, yet my wife's superabundant Good-nature is such
perpetual drawback on her oeconomy, that we run out considerably. This
extravagant and ill-judged Generosity renders all her numerous excellencies
of none effect: and I have often known her almost destitute of cloaths,
because she had distributed her whole wardrobe among lyars, sycophants,
and hypocrites.</P>
<P>THUS, Sir, as briefly as I can I have set before you my
un∣happy case. I am perishing by degrees, not by any real extravagance, any
designed ruin, or any indulgence of luxury and riot in the person who
destroys me. On the contrary, no woman can exceed my wife in the simplicity
of her dress, the humility of her desires, or the contented easiness of
her nature. What name, Sir, shall I give to my misfortunes? They proceed not
from vice, nor even from folly: they proceed from too tender a heart; a heart
that hurries away, or absorbs all judgment and reflection. To call these
errors the fruits of Good-nature is too mild a definition: 
<PB N="594" REF="169"/> and yet to give them an harsher appellation, is
unkind. Let me suffer what I will, I must kiss the dear hand that ruins
me.</P>
<P>IN my tender hours of speculation I would willingly im∣pute
my wife's faults to our climate, and the natural dis∣position of our
natives. When the <HI>English</HI> are Good-natured, they are generally so
to excess: and as I have not seen this particular character delineated in
any of your papers, I have endeavoured to paint it myself: and shall draw
to the conclusion of my letter by one piece of ad∣vice, <HI>Not to be</HI>
GENEROUS <HI>overmuch.</HI> The highest acts of Generosity are seldom
repaid in any other coin, but base∣ness and ingratitude: and we ought ever
to remember, that out of ten lepers cleaned, one only came back to return
thanks; the rest were made whole, and went their way.</P>

LONDON.</SIGNED></CLOSER>

<LETTER>
<HEAD>To Mr. TOWN.</HEAD>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>SIR!</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>T this season of the year, while the streets resound
with the cry of <HI>New Almanacks,</HI> and every stall is covered with News
from the Stars, Diaries, Predictions, Complete Ephemeris, &amp;c. drawn up by
<HI>Partridge, Parker, Vincent Wing,</HI> and the rest of the sagacious
body of Philomaths and Astrologers, give me leave to acquaint you of my
intentions of appearing annually in a like capacity. You must know, Sir, that
having observed, that among the great variety of Almanacks now published,
there is not one contrived for the use of people of fashion, I have
resolved to remedy this defect by publishing one every year 
<PB N="596" REF="171"/> under the title of the <HI>Court Calendar,</HI>
calculated for the Meridian of St. <HI>James</HI>'s.</P>
<P>THE plan, which has been hitherto followed by our
Almanack-makers, can be of no use whatever to the polite world, who are as
widely separated in their manner of living from the common herd of people as
the inhabitants of the <HI>Antipodes.</HI> To know the exact Rising and
Setting of the Sun may serve to direct the vulgar tradesman and mechanic
when to open shop or go to work: but persons of fashion, whose hours
are not marked by the course of that planet, are indifferent about its
motions; and like those who live under the Equinoctial Line, have their days
and nights of an equal degree of length all the year round. The Red-letter days
pointed out in our common Almanacks may perhaps be observed by some formal
ladies, who regulate their going to church by them: but people of quality
percieve no difference between the Moveable or Immoveable Feasts and Fasts,
and know no use of Sunday, but as it serves to call them to the card-table.
What advantage can a beau reap from <HI>Rider</HI>'s List of the Fairs, which
can only be of service to his groom? or what use can any gentleman or lady
make of those Diaries now inscribed to them; which are filled with Algebra
and the Mathematics? In a word, the present uncouth way of dividing the
months into Saints Days, Sundays, and the like, is no more adapted to the
present modes of polite life, than the <HI>Roman</HI> division into
<HI>Ides, Nones,</HI> and <HI>Calends.</HI></P>
<P>INSTEAD of supposing, with the vulgar tribe of
astro∣nomers, that the day begins at sunrise, my day, which will commence
at the time that it usually breaks in fashion∣able <PB N="597" REF="172"/>
apartments, will be determined by the Rising of people of quality. Thus the
morning dawns with early risers be∣tween eleven and twelve; and noon
commences at four, when, at this time of the year, the dinner and wax-lights
come in together. For want of a thorough knowledge of the distribution of the
day, all who have any connection with the polite world might be guilty of many
mistakes: and when an honest man from <HI>Cornhill</HI> intended a nobleman
a visit after dinner, he would perhaps find him sipping his morning
chocolate. The inconveniences of the old style in our manner of reckoning the
days were so manifest, that it was thought proper to amend them by act of
parli∣ament. I am resolved in like manner, to introduce the new style of
dividing the hours also into my Almanack: for can any thing be more absurd
than to fix the name of morning, noon, and evening, &amp;c. at present on the
same hours, which bore them in the reign of Queen <HI>Elizabeth?</HI> A
Dutchess is so far from dining at eleven, that it often happens that Her
Grace has not then opened her eyes on the tea-table; and a Maid of Honour would
no more rise at five or six in the morning, as it was called by the early
dames of Queen <HI>Bess</HI>'s court, than she would, in imitation of
those dames, breakfast upon strong beer and beef-steaks. Indeed in
those houses, where the hours of quality are observed by only one part of
the family, the impolite irre∣gularity of the other, in adhering to the old
style, occa∣sions great disturbance, for as Lady <HI>Townly</HI> says, 
<Q REND="inline">"such a house is worse than an inn with
ten stage coaches. What between the impertinent people of business in a
morning, and the intolerable thick shoes of footmen at noon, one has not a
wink of sleep all night."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="598" REF="173"/>THE reformation which I have also made
in respect to the Red-letter-days is no less considerable. I have not
only wiped away that immense catalogue of Saints which croud the
<HI>Popish</HI> Calendar, but have also blotted out all the other Saints
that still retain their places in our common Alma∣macks: well-knowing that
persons of fashion pay as little attention to the Apostles and
Evangelists, as to St. <HI>Mildred,</HI> St. <HI>Bridget,</HI> or St.
<HI>Winifred.</HI> Indeed I retain the old name of St. <HI>John,</HI> because
I am sure, that people of quality will not think of any body's being
designed under that title, except the late Lord <HI>Bolingbroke.</HI> Having
thus discarded the Saints, <HI>people whom nobody knows,</HI> I have taken
care to introduce my readers into the best company: for the Red-Letters in my
Calendar will serve to distinguish those days on which the ladies of
the first fashion keep their routes and visiting days: a work of infinite
use as well to the persons of distinction themselves, as to all those
who have any occa∣sional intercourse with the polite world. That season
of the year commonly distinguished by the appellation of <HI>Lent,</HI>
which implies a time of fasting, I shall consider, according to its real
signification in the <HI>Beau Monde,</HI> as a yearly <HI>festi∣val</HI>;
and shall therefore mention it under the denomination of <HI>The
Carnival.</HI> The propriety of this will be evident at first sight,
since nothing is so plain, as that at this season all kinds of
diversion and jollity are at the height in this metro∣polis. Instead of the
<HI>Man in the Almanack,</HI> I at first in∣tended (in imitation of Mr.
<HI>Dodsley</HI>'s Memorandum Book) to delineate the figure of a fine
gentleman drest <HI>à la mode:</HI> but I was at length determined, by
the advice of some inge∣nious friends, to suffer the old picture to remain
there; since as it appears to be run through the body in several places, it
may not improperly represent that fashionable character a Duellist.</P>
<P>IN the place which is allotted in other Almanacks for the
change of weather, (as hail, frost, snow, cloudy, and <PB N="599" REF="174"/> the like) I shall set down the change of dress, adapted to
different seasons, and ranged under the titles of hats, capu∣chins,
cardinals, sacks, negligees, gause handkerchiefs, ermine tippets, muffs,
&amp;c. and in a parallel column (according to the custom of other Almanacks)
I shall point out the several parts of the body, affected by these
changes; such as head, neck, breast, shoulders, face, hands, feet, legs,
&amp;c. And as Mr. <HI>Rider</HI> accompanies every month with seasonable
cau∣tions about sowing turnips, raising cabbages, blood-letting, and such
other important articles, I shall give such direc∣tions, as are most
suitable to the beau-monde: as a specimen of which I shall beg leave to
lay before you the following Observations on the month of May.</P>
<Q> 
<P>IF the season proves favourable, it will be proper at the
beginning of this month to attend to the cultivation of your public gardens.
Trim your trees, put your walks in order, look after your lamps, have ballads
written, and set to music, for the ensuing summer. Ladies and gentlemen
must be careful not to catch cold in crossing the water, or by
expo∣sing themselves to the damp air in the dark walk at
<HI>Vaux-hall.</HI></P> 
<P>Towards the middle of this month the air at both play∣houses
will begin to be too close and sultry for ladies, that paint, to risk the
loss of their complexion in them.</P> 
<P>About the end of this month it will be expedient for those
ladies, who are apt to be hysterical when the town empties, to prepare for
their removal to <HI>Tunbridge, Cheltenham,</HI> and <HI>Scarborough,</HI> for
the benefit of the waters.</P> </Q>

<P>AS my Aunt <HI>Singleton</HI> has publickly given her
honour, that she will never read any of your future papers, I think I may
venture to send you a letter without fear of her discovery: an incident,
which might per∣haps be of cruel consequence to me, as I know she can never
forgive. I am not under any apprehensions of being betrayed by her friends.
She has but few, and those are a sort that rather chuse to sooth her
weaknesses than to raise her choler; not knowing whether, in her hours of
peevishness, some of her bile may not fall upon themselves.</P>
<P>I OWN I was much surprised to find my name in print, and
to see my picture drawn at full length. I observe that my guardian Aunt,
like all painters whether male or female, has dipped her pencil in the colours
of flattery: and accordingly she has drawn me, if not entirely perfect, at
least only with such faults, as are rather commendable, than otherwise. 
<Q REND="inline">"A si∣lence in company, and too much
submission to judgments not so good as my own,"</Q> are failings
natural to my youth and want of experience, which time, and an introduction
into proper company, very different from such as I see at my Aunt's
tea-table, will soon cure: but I am still con∣scious that neither the
progress of time, the gifts of fortune, nor the success of improvement,
can render me, what she has already painted me, 
<Q> 
<L>A faultless monster whom the world ne'er
saw.</L></Q></P>
<P>SHE affirms, 
<Q REND="inline">"that I sing and play to great
perfection."</Q> Upon my word, Sir, I have no voice. She teizes me sometimes
to squall forth a Solo, and I obey, because as she justly tells you, 
<Q REND="inline">"I tremble at her look,"</Q> which, if it
had the family power of one of her antient ancestors, must long since
have turned me into stone. But what is the effect of my song? Alas it
generally proves, only an incantation to rouse the lapd-og out of a sound
sleep upon his cushion, or to set the parrot and the mackaw into a chorus
of screaming, that would if possible, awaken our neighbours the dead, in
<HI>St. Giles's Church Yard.</HI></P>
<P>SHE hints, that 
<Q REND="inline">"I am in love with a certain military
Gentleman of no fortune,"</Q> and she adds that 
<Q REND="inline">"he is modest, brave, studious, and
polite."</Q> That an officer comes often to our house is strictly true.
That he has no fortune is no less so. But that I am in love with him is
absolutely false, nor are his visits to me. They are to my Aunt, whom he
certainly 
<Q REND="inline">"would prefer to any dowager whatever
without a jointure;"</Q> and who, to my knowledge, would be highly pleased,
notwithstanding her family pride, to change the name of <HI>Singleton</HI>
into <HI>O-Kelly.</HI></P>
<P>THIS leads me to let you into the real cause, why she
prefers <HI>The</HI> WORLD to all other weekly essays whatever. The
partiality does not arise from the merit of the performance in general, but
from the subject of one parti∣cular paper, (N<SUP>o</SUP>. 28.) which constantly lies
upon her table, hid under the work-basket, and which strongly recommends by
various precepts and ex∣amples the admiration and love of OLD WOMEN.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR!</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> AM one of those idle people, (of whom you have lately
given an account) who not being bred to any business, or able to get a
livelihood by work, have taken up the more servile trade of an
<HI>Hanger-on.</HI></P>
<P>I FIRST served my time with an old nobleman in the country;
and as I was a distant relation of his lordship's, I was 
<PB N="602" REF="177"/> admitted to the honour of attending him in the double
ca∣pacity of valet, and apothecary. My business in a morn∣ing was to wait
on him at dressing time; to hold the bason while he washed his hands,
buckle his shoes, and tye on his neck-cloth. Besides this, his lordship
had such a regard for me, that nobody but myself was ever trusted with
cut∣ting his corns, or paring his toe-nails: and whenever he was sick, it was
always my office to hold his head during the operation of an emetic, to attend
him in the water-closet when he took a cathartic, and sometimes to
administer a clyster. If his lordship had no company, I was, indeed,
permitted to sit at table with him: but when he received any visiters more
grand than ordinary, I was equipped (toge∣ther with some of the
best-looking tenants) in a tye-wig, full-trimmed coat and laced-waistcoat,
in order to swell the retinue of his servants out of livery. I bore my
slavery with the greatest degree of patience; as my lord would often hint
to me, that I was provided for in his will. However, I had the mortification to
find myself supplanted in his good graces by the Chaplain, who had always
looked upon me as his rival, and contrived at length to out-wheedle, out-fawn,
and out-cringe me. In a word, my lord died:—and while the Chaplain (who
constantly prayed by him du∣ring his last illness) had the consolation
of having a good benefice secured to him in the will, my name was huddled
among those of the common servants, with no higher le∣gacy than twenty
guineas to buy mourning.</P>
<P>WITH this small pittance (besides what I had made a
shift to squeeze out of the tenants and tradesmen, as fees for my good
word, when I had his lordship's ear) I came up to town; and embarked all I
was worth in fitting my∣self <PB N="603" REF="178"/> out as a gentleman. Soon
after, as good luck would have it, the nephew and heir of my old lord came from
abroad: when I contrived to wind me into his favour by abusing his deceased
uncle, and fattened my∣self upon him. It is true, he supported me; admitted
me into an equal share of his purse: but considering the dan∣gers to
which I was constantly exposed on his account, I regarded his bounties as
only plaisters to my sores. My head, back and ribs have received many a
payment, which should have been placed to his lordship's account: and I
once narrowly escaped being hanged for murdering a poor fellow, whom my lord
in a frolick had run through the body. My patron, among other marks of his
taste, kept a mis∣tress; and I, as his particular crony and a man of
honour, was allowed to visit her. It happened one evening he un∣luckily
surprised us in some unguarded familiarities together. But my lord was
so far from being enraged at it, that he only turned madam out of the room,
and very coolly kicked me down stairs after her.</P>
<P>I WAS now thrown upon the wide world again: but as I never
wanted assurance, I soon made myself very familiarly acquainted with a
young gentleman from <HI>Ireland,</HI> who was just come over to
<HI>England</HI> to spend his estate here. I must own, I had some
difficulty in keeping on good terms with this new friend; as I had so many of
his own countrymen to contend with, who all claimed a right of acquaintance
with him, and some of them even pretended to be related to him. Besides,
they all persuaded the young squire, that they had fortunes in different
parts of <HI>Ireland</HI>; though not one of them had any real estate any
more than myself: though, indeed, I also had a nominal 1500<HI>l. per
Ann.</HI> in <PB N="604" REF="179"/> the <HI>West-Indies.</HI> These furious
fellows (for, Sir, they would all fight) gave me much trouble: however, I found
out my young friend's foible, and in spite of his countrymen became his
inseparable companion. He was not only very fond of women, but had a
particular passion for new faces; and to humour this inclination, I was
perpetually on the look-out to discover fresh pieces for him. I brought him
mantua-makers, milliners, and servant-maids in abundance; and at length grew
so great a favourite by having prevailed on one of my own cousins to comply
with his proposals, that I verily believe he would soon have made me easy
for life in an handsome annuity, if he had not been unfortunately run through
the body in a duel by one of his own countrymen.</P>
<P>I NEXT got into favour with an old colonel of the guards, who
happened to take a fancy to me one evening at the <HI>Tilt Yard</HI>
coffee-house, for having carried off a pint bumper more than a lieutenant of
a man of war, that had challenged my toast. As his sole delight was
centered in the bottle, all he required of me was to drink glass for glass
with him; which I readily complied with, as he always paid my reckon∣ing. When
sober he was the best-humoured man in the world: but he was very apt to be
quarrelsome and extremely mischievous when in liquor. He has more than once
flung a bottle at my head, and emptied the contents of a bowl of punch in my
face: sometimes he has diverted himself by setting fire to my ruffles,
shaking the ashes of his pipe over my perriwig, or making a thrust at me
with the red-hot poker: and I remember he once soused me all over with the
urine of the whole company, by clapping a large pewter Jordan topsy-turvy
upon my head. All these indignities <PB N="605" REF="180"/> I very patiently
put up with, as he was sure to make me double amends for them the next
morning: and I was very near procuring a commission in the army through his
interest, when to my great disappointment he was suddenly carried off by
an apoplexy.</P>
<P>YOU will be surprised when I tell you, that I next
con∣trived to squeeze myself into the good opinion of a rich old
curmudgeon, a city-merchant, and one of the circumcised. He could have no
objection to my religion, as I used to spend every Sunday with him at his
country-house, where I pre∣ferred playing at cards to going to church. Nor
could I, indeed, get any thing out of him beyond a dinner: but I had higher
points in view. As he had nobody to inherit his fortune but an only daughter,
(who was kept always in the country) I became so desperately in love with
her, that I would even have turned <HI>Jew</HI> to obtain her. Instead of
that, I very foolishly made a <HI>Christian</HI> of her, and we were
privately married at the <HI>Fleet.</HI> When I came to break the matter to the
father, and to make an apology for having converted her, he received me with a
loud laugh. 
<Q REND="inline">"Sir, says he, if my child had married the
DEVIL, he should have had every penny that was her due. But—as she is
only my Bastard, the law cannot oblige me to give her a farthing."</Q></P>
<P>THIS I found to be too true: and very happily for me my
<HI>Christian</HI> wife had so little regard for her new religion, that
she again became an apostate, and was taken into keep∣ing (to which I
readily gave my consent) by one of her own tribe and complexion. I shall
not tire you with a particular detail of what has happened to me since: I
shall only ac∣quaint <PB N="606" REF="181"/> you, that I have exactly followed
the precept of 
<Q REND="inline">"becoming all things to all men."</Q> I was
once supported very splendidly by a young rake of quality for my wit in
talking blasphemy and ridiculing the bible, till my patron shot himself
through the head: and I lived at bed and board with an old Methodist lady for
near a twelve-month on ac∣count of my zeal for the New Doctrine, till one of
the maid-servants wickedly laid a child to me. At present, Mr. TOWN, I am
quite out of employ; having just lost a very profitable place, which I held
under a great man in quality of his Pimp. My disgrace was owing to the
baseness of an old <HI>Covent-Garden</HI> acquaintance, whom I palmed upon
his honour for an innocent creature just come out of the coun∣try: but the
hussy was so ungrateful, as to bestow on both of us convincing marks of
her thorough knowledge of the town.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>S the appointed time of our publication now happens to fall on
New-year's-day, I cannot open the business of the year with a better grace,
than by taking the present hour for the subject of this paper: a subject,
which pleases me the more, as it also gives me an opportunity of paying my
readers the compliments of the season, and most sincerely wishing
them all <HI>a happy new year, and a great many of them.</HI> But in order to
make these civilities of more consequence than a bare compliment, I will
also endeavour to give them a little <PB N="608" REF="183"/> wholesome
advice, by which they may be most likely to ensure to themselves that
happiness, and to go through the ensuing year with ease and
tranquility.</P>
<P>No God in the heathen <HI>Pantheon</HI> was expressed by
properer emblems, or more significantly represented, than <HI>Janus,</HI>
whom we may fairly stile, in our language, the God of the New Year. The
medals on which the image of this Deity was engraved bore two faces, not ogling
each other like those on the shillings of <HI>Philip</HI> and
<HI>Mary,</HI> nor cheek by jowl like the double visage on the coin of
<HI>William</HI> and <HI>Mary,</HI> but turned from each other, one looking
forwards, as it were, into futurity, and the other taking a retrospective
view of what was past. There can∣not surely be devised a stronger, or
more sensible lesson of moral instruction, than this figure teaches
us. This double view comprehends in itself the sum of human prudence; for
the most perfect reason can go no higher than wisely to guess at the
future, by reflecting on the past; and morality is never so likely to
persevere in a steady and uniform course, as when it sets out with a
fix'd determination of mutually regulating the New Year by a recollection of
the Old, and at the same time making the succeeding a critique on the
last.</P>
<P>Most of the faults in the general conduct of mankind, and
their frequent miscarriages in their most favourite en∣terprizes, will be
found, upon examination, to result from an imperfect and partial view of what
relates to their duty or undertakings. Some regulate their actions by blind
guess, and rashly presuming on the future, without the least attention
to the past. With these the impe∣tuosity of the passions gives their
reason no scope to exert itself, but, neglecting the premises, they
jump to a con∣clusion. Others, who are often taken for men of deep 
<PB N="609" REF="184"/> reflection and marvellous understanding, meditate so
profoundly on the past, that they scarce take any notice either of the
present or the future. To these two cha∣racters, whose misconduct
arises from two such contrary sources, may indeed be added a third,
whose wild irre∣gular behaviour is founded on no fix'd principles, but
proceeds from a total absence of thought and reflection. These easy
creatures act entirely at random, neither troubling themselves with what has
been, what is, or what will be; and, as the image of <HI>Janus</HI> seems to
bear two heads, these thoughtless vacant animals may almost be said to
have no head at all.</P>
<P>But that the necessity of taking this comprehensive view of
our affairs may appear in the stronger light, let us consider the many
difficulties in which men of any of the above characters are involved from a
total neglect or partial survey of matters that should influence their
conduct. The first sort of men, who nourish great expectations from the
future, and suffer hope to lay their prudence to sleep, are very common:
Indeed almost every man, like the dairy-maid with her pail of milk, pleases
himself with calculating the advantages he shall reap from his
undertakings. There is scarce a servitor at either university, who, when
he takes orders, does not think it more than possible he may one day be a
bishop, or at least head of a college, though perhaps at first he is glad
to snap at a curacy. Every walking attendant on our hospitals flatters
himself that a few years will settle him in high practice and a chariot:
and among those few gentlemen of the inns of court, who really deserve the
name of students, there is hardly one who sits down to Lord <HI>Coke</HI>
without imagining that he may himself, some time or other, be Lord
Chancellor. At this early period <PB N="610" REF="185"/> of life these vain
hopes may perhaps serve as spurs to dili∣gence and virtue; but what shall
we say to those people, who in spite of experience and repeated
disappointments, still place their chief dependance on groundless
expecta∣tions from their future fortune? This Town swarms with people who
rely almost solely on contingencies: and our goals are often filled with
wretches who brought on their own poverty and misfortunes, by promising
themselves great profit from some darling scheme, which has at last
been attended with bankruptcy. The present extra∣vagance of many of our
spend-thrifts is built on some ideal riches of which they are soon to be
in pos∣session; and which they are laying out as freely, as the girl in
the farce squanders the ten thousand pounds she was to get in the
lottery. I am myself acquainted with a young fellow who had great
expectations from an old uncle. He had ten thousand pounds of his own in
ready money; and as the old gentleman was a good deal turned of sixty, the
nephew very considerately computed, that his uncle could hardly last above
five years, during which time he might go on very genteely at the rate of
2000<HI>l. per ann.</HI> However the old gentleman held toge∣ther above seven
years, the two last of which our young spark had no consolation but the
daily hopes of his uncle's death. The happy hour at length arrived; the will
was tore open with rapture; when, alas! the fond youth discovered, that he
had never once reflected, that though he had a ticket in the wheel, it might
possibly come up a blank, and had the mortification to find himself
disin∣herited.</P>
<P>I shall not dwell so particularly on the ridiculous folly of
those profound speculatists, who fix their attention en∣tirely on what is
past, without making their reflections of service either for the present
or the future, because it is not a very common or tempting species of
absurdity: <PB N="611" REF="186"/> but shall rather advise the reader to
consider the time past, as the school of experience, from which he may
draw the most useful lessons for his future conduct. This kind of
retrospect would teach us to provide with fore∣sight against the
calamities to which our inexperience has hitherto exposed us, though at the
same time it would not throw us so far back, as to keep us lagging, like
the Old Stile, behind the rest of the world. To say the truth, those
sage persons who are given to such deep re∣flection, as to let to-day and
to-morrow pass unregarded by meditating on yesterday, are as ridiculous in
their con∣duct, as country beaux in their dress, who adopt the town modes,
just after they are become unfashionable in <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>But there is no task so difficult as to infuse ideas into
a brain hitherto entirely unaccustomed to thinking: for how can we warn a man
to avoid the misfortunes which may hereafter befal him, or to improve by the
calamities he has already suffered, whose actions are not the result of
thought, or guided by experience? These persons are, indeed, of all others,
the most to be pitied. They are prodigal and abandoned in their conduct, and
by vi∣cious excesses ruin their constitution, till at length poverty and
death stare them in the face together; or if, unfortu∣nately, their crazy
frame holds together after the utter destruction of their fortune, they
finish a thoughtless life by an act of desperation, and a pistol puts
an end to their miseries.</P>
<P>Since then good fortune cannot be expected to fall into our
laps, and it requires some thought to ensure to our∣selves a likelihood
of success in our undertakings, let us look back with attention on the old
year, and gather instruc∣tions from it in what manner to conduct ourselves
through <PB N="612" REF="187"/> the New. Let us also endeavour to draw from it
a lesson of morality: and I hope it will not be thought too solemn a
conclusion of this paper, if I advise my readers to carry this reflection
even into religion. This train of thought, that teaches us at once to reflect
on the past, and look forward to the future, will also naturally lead us to
look up with awe and admiration towards that Being who has existed from all
eternity, and shall exist world with∣out end. No idea can give us a more
exalted idea of the Power who first created us, and whose providence is
always over us. Let us then consider with attention this pagan image, by
which we may add force to our morality, and prudence to our ordinary conduct;
nor let us blush to receive a lesson from Heathens, which may animate our
zeal and reverence for the Author of Christianity.</P>

<HEAD>To Mr. TOWN.</HEAD>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>T has been my good fortune to be born of a family, that is
recorded in the Herald's Dictionary, as one of the most antient in the
kingdom: We are supposed to have come into <HI>England</HI> with
<HI>William</HI> the Con∣queror. Upon my accession some years ago to my
elder brother's estate and title of a Baronet, I received a visit from
<HI>Rouge Dragon,</HI><ABBR>Esq</ABBR> Pursuivant at Arms, to congratulate
me upon my new rank of a <HI>Vavasour,</HI> and to know whether I should
chuse to bear the <HI>dexter base points of the Lady Isa∣bel's Saltire in
chief,</HI> or only her <HI>Sinister corners</HI>; she being one of the
seventeen coheiresses of my great great great <PB N="614" REF="189"/>
great great grandfather's fourth wife <HI>Dorothy,</HI> the daughter and sole
heiress of <HI>Simon de la Frogpool</HI> of <HI>Croakham</HI> in
<HI>Suf∣folk.</HI> This unexpected visit must have disconcerted me to an
invincible degree, if upon recollection I had not only re∣membered Mr.
<HI>Rouge Dragon</HI> as a constant companion to my late brother, but as a
kind of tutor in initiating him into the Science of Heraldy, and the Civil and
Military Atchievements, to which our nobility and gentry are entitled. As
soon, therefore, as I could recover myself from my first surprise in
hearing an unknown <HI>English</HI> language, I hum∣bly thanked Mr.
<HI>Dragon</HI> for the pains he had taken in con∣sidering my Coat of Arms
so minutely, but hoped he would give himself no farther trouble upon my
account: because I was fully determined to <HI>bear</HI> the plain
<HI>Shield</HI> of my grand∣father Sir <HI>Peter,</HI> without taking the
least notice of Lady <HI>Isabel's Saltire in chief,</HI> or even of her
<HI>Sinister corners.</HI></P>
<P>BE it to my shame or not, I must confess that Heraldry
is a science, which I have never much cultivated: nor do I find it very
prevalent among the fashionable studies of the age. Arms, and Armorial
tokens, may, I suppose, be regu∣larly distinguished, and properly
emblazoned, upon the family plate to which they belong: but I have observed
of late, that these honorable ensigns are not confined entirely to their
proper owners, but are usurped by every body, who thinks fit to take them;
insomuch that there is scarce an hackney coach in <HI>London,</HI> which is
not in possession of a Ducal Crest, an Earl's Coronet, or a Baronet's
Bloody Hand. This has often given me great offence, as it reflects a scandal
on our nobility and gentry: and I cannot but think it very indecent for a
Duke's coach to be seen waiting at a night-cellar while the coach∣man 
<PB N="615" REF="190"/> is tipping off a glass of gin, or for a Countess's
landau to set down ladies at the door of a common bawdy-house. I remember I
was one morning disturbed at my breakfast by a fashionable rap at my
door; when looking out of my window I saw the coach of the lady dowager
— drawn up before it. I was extremely surprised at so early and
un∣expected a visit from her ladyship; and while I was pre∣paring to
receive her, I over-heard her ladyship at high words with her coachman in my
entry; when stepping to the stair-case I found that they were
squabbling together about sixpence, and soon perceived that her
ladyship was dwindled into one of my house-maids. This badge of nobility,
assu∣med at random according to the fancy of the coach-painter, I have
found inconvenient on other occasions: for I once travelled from
<HI>London</HI> to <HI>Derby</HI> in an hired chariot finely or∣namented with a
Viscount's cypher and coronet; by which noble circumstance I was compelled
in every inn to pay as a Lord, though I was not at that time even a simple
Baronet, or (in the language of my friend Mr. <HI>Dragon)</HI> arrived to the
dignity of a <HI>Vavasour.</HI></P>
<P>I HAVE, indeed, sometimes doubted, whether nobility and high
rank are of that real advantage, which they are generally esteemed to be: and
I am almost inclined to think, that they answer no other desirable end,
than as far as they indulge our vanity and ostentation. A long roll of
ennobled ancestors makes, I confess, a very alluring appearance: To see
coronet after coronet passing before our view in an uninterrupted
succession, is the most soothing prospect, that perhaps can
present itself to the eye of human pride: The exaltation that we feel upon
such a review takes rise in a visionary and secret piece of flattery,
that as glorious, and as <PB N="616" REF="191"/> long, or even a longer line of
future coronets may spring from ourselves, as have depended from our
ancestors. We read in <HI>Virgil,</HI> that <HI>Anchises,</HI> to inspire
his son with the properest incitement to virtue, shews him a long race of
kings, emperors, and heroes, whom <HI>Aeneas</HI> is fore-doomed to give rise
to: and the misery of <HI>Macbeth</HI> is made by <HI>Shakespeare</HI> to
proceed, less from the consciousness of guilt, than from the
disappointed pride, that none of his own race shall succeed him in the
throne.</P>
<P>THE pride of ancestry, and the desire of continuing our
lineage, when they tend to an incitement of virtuous and noble actions, are
undoubtedly laudable; and I should per∣haps have indulged myself in the
pleasing reflection, had not a particular story in a <HI>French</HI> Novel,
which I lately met with, put a stop to all vain glories, that can
possibly be deduced from a long race of progenitors.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">"A NOBLEMAN of an antient house, of very
high rank and great fortune,"</Q> says the Novellist, 
<Q REND="inline">"died suddenly, and without being permitted
to stop at Purgatory, was sent down immediately into Hell. He had not been
long there, before he met with his coachman <HI>Thomas,</HI> who like his noble
master was gnashing his teeth among the damned. <HI>Thomas,</HI>
surprised to behold his lordship amidst the sharpers, thieves,
pickpockets, and all the <HI>Canaille</HI> of Hell, started and cried out in
a tone of admiration, Is it possible that I see my late master among
<HI>Lucifer</HI>'s tribe of beggars, rogues, and pilferers? How much am I
astonished to find your lordship in this place? Your lordship! whose
generosity was so great, whose affluent housekeeping drew such crowds
of nobility, gentry, and <PB N="617" REF="192"/> friends to your table, and
within your gates, and whose fine taste employed such numbers of poor in
your gardens, by building temples and obelisks, and by forming lakes of
water, that seemed to vye with the largest oceans of the creation. Pray, my
lord, if I may be so bold, what crime has brought your lordship into this
cursed assembly?—Ah, <HI>Thomas,</HI> replied his lordship with
his usual con∣descension, I have been sent hither for having defrauded
my royal master, and cheating the widows and fatherless, solely to
enrich, and purchase titles, honours, and estates for that ungrateful
rascal my only son. But prithee, <HI>Tho∣mas,</HI> tell me, as thou didst
always seem to be an honest, careful, sober servant, what brought thee
hither? Alas! my noble lord, replied <HI>Thomas,</HI> I was sent hither for
be∣getting that Son."</Q></P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>I am, Sir, your most humble Servant, REGINALD
FITZWORM.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>I MUST agree with my correspondent, that the study of
Heraldry is at present in very little repute among us; and our nobility are
more anxious about preserving the genealogy of their horses, than of their
own family. Whatever value their progenitors may have formerly set upon their
Blood, it is now found to be of no value, when put into the scale and weighed
against solid <HI>plebeian</HI> gold: Nor would the most illustrious
descendant from <HI>Cadwallader,</HI> or the <HI>Irish</HI> Kings,
scruple to debase his lineage by an alliance with the daughter of a
city-plumb, though all her ancestors were yeomen, and none of her family ever
<HI>bore arms.</HI> Titles of quality, when the owners have no other merit to
recommend them, are of no more estimation, than those which the courtesy
of the vulgar have bestowed on the deformed: and when I look over a long Tree
of Descent, I sometimes fancy I can discover the real characters of
<HI>Sharpers, Repro∣bates,</HI> and <HI>Plunderers of their Country,</HI>
concealed under the titles of <HI>Dukes, Earls,</HI> and
<HI>Viscounts.</HI></P>
<P>IT is well known, that the very servants, in the absence of
their master, assume the same titles; and <HI>Tom</HI> or
<HI>Harry,</HI> the butler or groom of his Grace, is always <HI>my Lord
Duke</HI> <PB N="618" REF="193"/> in the kitchen or stables. For this reason
I have thought proper to present my reader with the Pedigree of a Footman,
drawn up in the same sounding titles, as are so pompously displayed
on these occasions: and I dare say it will appear no less illustrious,
than the pedigrees of many families, which are neither celebrated for their
actions, nor distinguished by their virtues.</P>
<P>THE Family of the SKIPS, or SKIP-KENNELS, is very antient and
noble. The founder of it <HI>Maitre Jaques</HI> came into <HI>England</HI> with
the Dutchess of Mazarine. He was son of a Prince of the Blood, his mother
one of the <HI>Mesdames</HI> of <HI>France:</HI> This family is therefore
related to the most illus∣trious <HI>Maitres d' Hotèl</HI> and
<HI>Valets de Chambre</HI> of that kindgom. <HI>Jaques</HI> had issue two
Sons, <HI>viz. Robert</HI> and <HI>Paul</HI>; of whom <HI>Paul</HI> the
youngest was invested with the purple before he was eighteen, and made a
Bishop, and soon after became an Archbishop. <HI>Robert,</HI> the elder,
came to be a Duke, but died without issue: <HI>Paul,</HI> the Archbishop,
left behind him an only daughter, <HI>Barbara,</HI> base-born, who was
afterwards Maid of Honour; and inter-marrying with a Lord of the Bed-chamber,
had a very numerous issue by him; <HI>viz. Re∣becca,</HI> born a week after
their marriage, and died young; <HI>Joseph,</HI> first a Squire, afterwards
Knighted, High Sheriff of a County, and Colonel of the Militia; <HI>Peter,</HI>
raised from a Cabin-Boy to a Lord of the Admiralty; <HI>William,</HI> a
Faggot in the First Regiment of the Guards, and a Brigadier;
<HI>Tho∣mas,</HI> at first an Earl's Eldest Son, and afterwards Lord Mayor
of the City of <HI>London.</HI> The several branches of this family were no
less distinguished for their illustrious progeny. <HI>Jaques</HI> the
founder, first quartered lace on his coat, and <HI>Robert</HI> added the
shoulder-knot. Some of them, indeed, met with great trouble: Archbishop
<HI>Paul</HI> lost his See for getting a cook-maid with child;
<HI>Barbara,</HI> the Maid of Honour, was dismissed with a big belly;
Brigadier <HI>William</HI> was killed by a Chairman in a pitched battle at an
ale-house; the Lord of the Admi∣ralty was transported for seven years;
and Duke <HI>Robert</HI> had the misfortune to be hanged at
<HI>Tyburn.</HI></P>

<OPENER>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>T is my fortune to be married to a lady, who is an
extraordinary good housewife, and is cried up by all the good women of her
acquaintance, for being the <HI>neatest body in her house</HI> they ever
knew. This, Sir, is my grievance: This superabundant Neatness is so very
troublesome and disgusting to me, that I protest I had rather lodge in
a carrier's inn, or take up my abode with the horses in the stables.</P>
<P>IT must be confessed, that a due regard to Neatness
and Cleanliness is as necessary to be observed in our habitations 
<PB N="620" REF="195"/> as our persons: But though I should not chuse to
have my hands begrimed like a chimney-sweeper's, I would not, as among the
superstitious <HI>Mahometans,</HI> wash them six times a day: And
though I should be loth to roll in a pig-stye, yet I do not like to have my
house rendered useless to me under the pretence of keeping it clean.</P>
<P>FOR my own part, I cannot see the difference between having
an house that is always dirty, and an house that is always to be cleaned. I
could very willingly compound to be washed out of my home, with other
masters of families, every Saturday night: But my wife is so very notable,
that the same cleansing work must be repeated every day in the week. All
the morning long I am sure to be entertained with the domestic concert of
scrubbing the floors, scouring the irons, and beating the carpets; and I am
constantly hunted from room to room, while one is to be dusted, ano∣ther
dry-rubbed, another washed, and another run over with a dry mop. Thus,
indeed, I may be said to live in continual dirtiness, that my house may
be clean: For during these nice operations every apartment is stowed with
soap, brickdust, sand, scrubbing-brushes, hair-brooms, rag-mops, and
dishclouts.</P>
<P>YOU may suppose, that the greatest care is taken to
pre∣vent the least speck of dirt from soiling the floors: For this
reason all that come to our house, (besides the ceremony of scraping at
the door,) are obliged to rub their shoes for half an hour on a large ragged
mat at the entrance; and then they must straddle their way along several
lesser mats, ranged at due distances from each other in the passage,
and (like boys at play) come into the room with a hop, a step, and a 
<PB N="621" REF="196"/> jump. The like caution is used by all the family: I
my∣self am scarce allowed to stir a step without slippers: my wife
creeps on tip-toe up and down stairs: the maid-servants are continually
stumping below in clogs or pattens; and the footman is obliged to sneak
about the house bare-footed, as if he came with a sly design to steal
something.</P>
<P>AFTER what has been said you will naturally conclude, that
my wife must be no less nice in other particulars. In∣deed, she cannot
conceive that any thing, which is done by so neat a woman, can possibly
give offence: I have there∣fore been in pain for her several times, when I
have seen her, before company, dust the tea-cups with a foul apron or a
washing-gown; and I have more than once blushed for her, when through her
extreme cleanliness she has not been con∣tented without breathing into our
drinking-glasses, and after∣wards wiping them with her pocket handkerchief.
People, Mr. TOWN, who are very intimate with families, seldom see them
(especially the female part) but in disguise: and it will be readily
allowed, that a lady wears a very different aspect, when she comes before
company, than when she first sets down to her toilette. My wife appears
decent enough in her apparel, to those who visit us in the after∣noon: but
in the morning she is quite another figure. Her usual dishabille then is,
an ordinary stuff jacket and petticoat, a double clout thrown over her head
and pinned under her chin, a black greasy bonnet, and a coarse dowlas
apron; so that you would rather take her for a chair-woman. Nor, indeed does
she scruple to stoop to the meanest drudgery of one: for such is her
love of Cleanliness, that I have often seen her on her knees whitening an
hearth, or spreading dabs of vinegar and fullers earth over the boards.</P>
<P><PB N="622" REF="197"/>IT is observed by <HI>Swift,</HI> that

<Q REND="inline">"a nice man is a man of nasty ideas:"</Q> In
like manner we may affirm, that your very neat people are the most slovenly
on many occasions. I have told you my wife's morning trim: but besides
this, she has another custom, which creates the greatest disgust in
me. You must know, Sir, that among other charms she prides herself
vastly in a fine set of teeth: and somebody has told her, that nothing is
so good for them as to rub them every morning with <HI>Scotch</HI> snuff
and fasting spittle. As an hus∣band is no stranger, this recipe is
constantly administered in my presence before breakfast; and after this
delicate appli∣cation, her pretty mouth, (which is afterwards wiped for
<HI>me</HI> to kiss,) in order to preserve her gums from the scurvy,
must be rinced—would you believe it?—with her own water.</P>
<P>I SHALL dwell no longer on this subject, as I fear it may
prove surfeiting both to you and your readers: I shall there∣fore conclude
with telling you, that this scrupulous delicacy of my wife in the Neatness
of her house was the means of our losing a very good fortune. A rich old
uncle, on whom we had great dependance, came up to town last summer on
purpose to pay us a visit: but though he had rode above sixty miles that
day, he was obliged to stand in the passage till his boots were pulled
off, for fear of soiling the <HI>Turkey</HI> carpet. After supper the old
gentleman, as was his constant practice, desired to have his pipe: but this
you may be sure could by no means be allowed, as the filthy stench of the
to∣bacco would never be got out of the furniture again; and it was with much
ado, that my wife would even suffer him to go down and smoke in the
kitchen. We had no room <PB N="623" REF="198"/> lodge him in except a garret
with nothing but bare walls; because the Chints bed-chamber was, indeed, too
nice for a dirty country squire. These slights very much chagrined my
good uncle: but he had not been with us above a day or two, before my wife and
he came to an open quarrel; and the occasion of it was this. It happened,
that he had brought a favourite pointer with him, who at his first co∣ming
was immediately locked up in the coal-hole: but the dog having found means to
escape, had crept slily up stairs, and (besides other marks of his want
of delicacy) had very calmly stretched himself out upon a crimson
damask settee. My wife not only sentenced him to the discipline of the
whip, but insisted upon having the criminal hanged up after∣wards; when the
master interposing in his behalf, it pro∣duced such high words between
them, that my uncle or∣dered his horse, and swore he would never <HI>darken
our doors</HI> again as long as he breathed. He went home, and about two months
after died: but as he could not forgive the ill treatment, which both he and
his dog had met with at our house, he had altered his will, which before he
had made entirely in our favour.</P>

MUCKLOVE.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>IT may not be improper, as my correspondent has but slightly
touched upon this topic, to add a word or two, by way of postcript to his
letter, on the extraordinary sollici∣tude of many notable housewives in the
care and preserva∣tion of their furniture. In middling genteel families it is
not uncommon to have things more for shew than use: <PB N="624" REF="199"/>
and I cannot but applaud the ingenious thought of a friend of mine, who has
contrived to furnish his house in the most elegant taste at a very
small expence. He is pleased, it is true, to eat off your common stone
ware, because it looks so clean; but you see his beaufet crowded with a
variety of curious enamelled China plates, which are ranged in such manner as
to conceal the streaks of white paint that cement the broken pieces together:
he likes to drink his porter out of the original ale-house pewter pot; but a
large silver tan∣kard always stands upon the side-board, which the most
curious eye cannot at that distance discover to be <HI>French</HI> plate.
The whole range of rooms in his middle story is most grandly fitted up: but
as it would be pity to soil such good furniture, his curtains, which we
must suppose to be made of the richest damask, are carefully pinned
up in paper-bags; and the chairs, of which the seats and backs are
undoubtedly of the same stuff, are no less cautiously skreened with
ordinary-checked linnen. Thus does he an∣swer, by the appearance of finery,
all the purposes of pride and ostentation:—Like many families, who
being really possessed of ornamental and useful furniture, make no
more use of it than the beau blockhead does of his library; which, though it
contains many books finely bound and gilt, is designed merely for shew, and
it would spoil the backs or rumple the leaves to look into the contents of
them.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="body of issue">
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE use of language is the ready communi∣cation of our
thoughts to one another. As we cannot produce the objects which raise ideas
in our minds, we use words which are made signs of those objects
themselves. No man could convey to another the idea of a table or chair,
without pointing to those pieces of furniture: as children are taught to
remember the names of things by looking at their pictures. Thus if I wanted to
mention King <HI>Charles</HI> on horse-back, I must carry my companion to
<HI>Charing-Cross</HI>; and would I next tell him of the statue of Sir
<HI>John Barnard,</HI> we must trudge back again, and he must wait for my
mean∣ing 'till we got to the <HI>Royal Exchange.</HI> We should be like the
sages of <HI>Laputa,</HI> who (as <HI>Gulliver</HI> tells us) having
substituted <HI>things</HI> for <HI>words,</HI> used to carry about them 
<PB N="626" REF="201"/> such <HI>things</HI> as were necessary to
express the particular business they were to discourse on. 
<Q REND="inline">"I have often beheld (says he) two of those
sages almost sinking under the weight of their packs, like pedlars among
us: who, when they met in the streets, would lay down their loads, open their
sacks, and hold conversation for an hour together; then put up their
implements, help each other to resume their burthens, and take their
leave."</Q> In these circumstances a man of the fewest words could not,
indeed, talk without carrying about him a much larger apparatus of
conversation, than is contained in the bag of the noted <HI>Yeates,</HI> or
any other slight-of-hand artist: he could not speak of a chicken or an
owl, but it must be ready in his pocket to be produ∣ced. In such a case
we could not say we heard, but we saw the conversation of a friend; as in
the epistolary correspond∣ence carried on by those pretty
<HI>hieroglyphic</HI> letters (as they are called), where the picture of a
<HI>deer</HI> and a <HI>woman finely drest</HI> is made to stand for the
expression of <HI>dear lady.</HI></P>
<P>BUT the invention of words has removed these difficulties; and
we may talk not only of any thing we have seen, but what neither we, nor the
persons to whom we speak, ever saw. Thus we can convey to another the
idea of a battle, without being reduced to the disagreeable necessity of
learn∣ing it 
<Q REND="inline">"from the cannon's mouth:"</Q> and we can talk
of the people in the world of the moon, without being obliged to make use of
Bishop <HI>Wilkins</HI>'s artificial wings to fly thither. Words, therefore,
in the ordinary course of life, are like the paper-money among merchants;
invented as a more ready conveyance, by which the largest sum can be
trans∣mitted to the most distant places with as much ease as a let∣ter;
while the same in specie would require bags and chests, and even carts or
ships to transport it. But, however great these advantages are, the use
of language has brought along with it several inconveniences, as well as
paper-money: for as this latter is more liable to miscarry, more easily
concealed, <PB N="627" REF="202"/> carried off, or counterfeited than bullion,
merchants have frequent cause to complain, that the convenience of this
sort of cash is not without some alloy of evil; and we find, that in the
use of language there is so much room for deceit and mistake, that though
it does not render it useless, it is much to be wished some remedy
could be contrived.</P>
<P>MEN are so apt to use the same words in different
senses, and to call the same thing by different names, that they can∣not
oftentimes understand or be understood. If one calls that thing black which
another calls green, or that prodigality which another calls generosity, they
mistake each other's meaning; and can never come to agree, 'till they explain
the words. It is to this we owe so much wrangling in dis∣course, and so
many volumes of controversy on almost every part of literature. I have
known a dispute carried on with great warmth, and when the disputants have
come to explain what each meant, it has been discovered they were both of a
side: like the men in the Play, who met and fought first, and after each
had been heartily beat found themselves to be friends. What should we
say, if this practice of calling things by their wrong names was to obtain
among tradesmen? If you was to send to your haberdasher for an hat, you
might receive a pair of stockings; or instead of a cordial julep from your
apothecary, be furnished with a cathartic or a clyster.</P>
<P>IT would be needless to insist on the inconveniences
ari∣sing from the misuse or misapprehension of terms in all ver∣bal
combats; whether they be fought on the spot by word of mouth, or (like a game
of Chess) maintained, even tho' lands and seas interpose, by the
assistance of the press. In our ordinary conversation it is
notorious, that no less confu∣sion has arisen from the wrong application
or perversion of the original and most natural import of words. Thus, for
instance, the word <HI>Devil,</HI> is used at present only as a bug∣bear
for children; nor will it raise in the most vulgar minds 
<PB N="628" REF="203"/> the idea even of a cloven foot or the smell of
brimstone: and all we can understand by it are, the errand-boy of a
printing-house, the name of a tavern, and the broiled giz∣zard of a turkey.
The no less tremendous words, <HI>damned</HI> and <HI>hellish,</HI> are
usurped equally to signify any thing superla∣tively good, as well as bad:
and I am almost ashamed to mention, that we cannot wonder a particular
liquor should be distinguished by the name of <HI>bishop,</HI> when the
title of the highest dignitary of our church has been prostituted to a more
scandalous purpose. A mere country put might be startled (at this
juncture especially) at the warlike sound of a <HI>route,</HI> a
<HI>drum,</HI> or a <HI>drum-major</HI>; which, we know, have been long adopted
by the fashionable world without any de∣sign to alarm us with the notion of
a campaign or a battle, but only to call us (without a pun) to more peaceful
engage∣ments: and he would be very much surprised to receive a card from a
lady of quality inviting him to an <HI>Hurricane,</HI> or perhaps an
EARTHQUAKE.</P>
<P>I REMEMBER, when I commenced author, I published a little
pamphlet, which I flattered myself had some merit, though I must
confess it did not sell. Conscious of my grow∣ing fame, I resolved to
send the first fruits of it to an aunt in the country, that my relations
might judge of the great ho∣nour I was likely to prove to the family: but how
was I mortified, when the good lady sent me word, 
<Q REND="inline">"that she was sorry to find I had
<HI>ruined</HI> myself, and had wrote a book; for the parson of the
parish had assured her, that authors were never worth a farthing, and
always died in a goal."</Q> Notwithstanding this remonstrance I have
still persisted in my <HI>ruin</HI>; which at present I cannot say is
quite compleated, as I can make three meals a day, have yet a coat to my back,
with a clean shirt for Sundays at least, and am lodged somewhat below a
garret. However, this pre∣diction of my aunt has often led me to consider, in
how many senses different from its general acceptation the word 
<PB N="629" REF="204"/> RUINED is frequently made use of. When we hear this
ap∣plied to another, we should naturally imagine the person is reduced to a
state worse than he was in before, and so low that it is scarce
possible for him to rise again: but we shall often find, instead of
his being undone, that he has rather met with some extraordinary good
fortune; and that those who pronounce him <HI>ruined,</HI> either mean you
should understand it in some other light, or else call him undone,
because he differs from them in his way of life, or because they wish him
to be in that situation. I need not point out the extreme cruelty, as well as
injustice, in the misapplica∣tion of this term; as it may litterally
<HI>ruin</HI> a man, by de∣stroying his character: according to the old
<HI>English</HI> proverb, <HI>give a dog an ill name, and hang him.</HI></P>
<P>MOST people are, indeed, so entirely taken up with their own
narrow views, that, like the jaundiced eye, every thing appears to them of the
same colour; and it is no wonder, that they should see ruin staring
every man in the face, who happens not to think as they do. From this
selfish preju∣dice we are led to make a wrong judgment of the motives and
actions of others: I shall, therefore, here set down a catalogue of some
of my own acquaintance, whom the cha∣rity and good-nature of the world have not
scrupled to pro∣nounce absolutely <HI>ruined.</HI></P>
<Q> 
<P>A young clergyman of <HI>Cambridge</HI> might have had a good
college living in about thirty years time, or have been head of the house:
but he chose to quit his fellowship for a small cure in town with a view
of recommending himself by his preaching—<HI>Ruined.</HI></P> 
<P>A fellow of another college refused to quit his books and his
retirement, to live as chaplain with a smoking, drinking, swearing,
fox-hunting country squire, who would have pro∣vided for
him—<HI>Ruined.</HI></P> 
<P>Dr. <HI>Classic,</HI> a young physician from
<HI>Oxford,</HI> might have had more practice than <HI>Radcliffe</HI> or
<HI>Mead:</HI> but having studied <PB N="630" REF="205"/> <HI>Aristotle's
Poetics,</HI> and read the <HI>Greek</HI> Tragedies as well as <HI>Galen</HI>
and <HI>Hippocrates,</HI> he was tempted to write a play, which was
universally applauded—<HI>Ruined.</HI></P> 
<P>A Student of the <HI>Temple</HI> might have made sure of a
Judge's Robes or the Chancellor's Seals: but being tired of saunter∣ing in
<HI>Westminster Hall</HI> without even getting half a guinea for a motion,
he has accepted of a commission in one of the new-raised regiments, and
is—<HI>Ruined.</HI></P> 
<P>A younger brother of a good family threw himself away upon an
obscure widow with a jointure of 500<HI>l. per annum</HI> by which he
is—<HI>Ruined.</HI>—Another, a man of fortune, fell in love with,
and married a genteel girl without a farthing; and though she makes him an
excellent wife, he is universally allowed to have—<HI>Ruined
himself.</HI></P></Q>
<P>BEFORE I conclude I cannot but take notice of the strange
sense, in which a friend of mine once heard this word used by a girl of
the town. The young creature, being all life and spirits, engrossed all
the conversation to herself; and her∣self indeed was the subject of all
the conversation: But what most surprised him, was the manner, in which
she used this word <HI>Ruined</HI>; which occurred frequently in her
discourse, though never intended by her to convey the meaning gene∣rally
affixed to it. It served her sometimes as an aera to determine the date of
every occurrence—she bought such a gown just after she was
<HI>ruined</HI>—the first time she saw <HI>Garrick</HI> in
<HI>Ranger,</HI> she was in doubt whether it was before or after she was
<HI>ruined.</HI>—Having occasion to mention a young gen∣tleman, she
burst into raptures—O he is a dear creature!—He it was that
<HI>ruined</HI> me.—O he is a dear soul!—He car∣ried me to an inn
ten miles from my father's house in the country, where he <HI>ruined</HI>
me.—If he had not <HI>ruined</HI> me, I should have been as miserable
and as moping as my sisters. But the dear soul was forced to go to sea,
and I was obliged to come upon the town, three weeks after I was
<HI>ruined</HI>—no, not so much as three weeks after I was
<HI>ruined</HI>—yes, it was full three weeks after I was
<HI>ruined.</HI></P>

has lately sent me an account of a <HI>Country Parson</HI>; which I dare

our Clergy than what they have collected from the spruce and genteel figures,
which they have been used to contemplate here in doctors scarfs,
pudding-sleeves, starched bands, and feather-topp'd grizzles. It will be
found from my Cousin's de∣scription, that these reverent ensigns of

that when they are out of the pulpit or surplice, the good pastors may

<SALUTE>DEAR COUSIN!</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM just arrived here, after having paid a visit to our
old acquaintance <HI>Jack Quickset,</HI> who is now become the Reverend Mr.
<HI>Quickset,</HI> Rector of — parish in the North-Riding of this
county, a living worth upwards of three hundred pounds <HI>per annum.</HI> As
the ceremonies of ordination have occasioned no alteration in <HI>Jack</HI>'s
morals or behaviour, the Figure he makes in the church is some∣what
remarkable; but as there are many other incumbents of country livings, whose
clerical characters will be found to tally with his, perhaps a slight
sketch, or, as I may say, <HI>rough draught</HI> of him, with some
account of my visit, will not be unentertaining to your readers.</P>
<P>JACK, hearing that I was in this part of the world, sent me
a very hearty letter, informing me that he had been <HI>double-japanned</HI>
(as he called it) about a year ago, and was the present incummbent of
—; where if I would favour him with my company, he would give me a cup of
the best <HI>Yorkshire</HI> Stingo, and would engage to shew me a noble
day's sport, as he was in a fine open country with plenty of foxes. I
rejoiced to hear he was so comfortably settled, and set out immediately
for his living. When I arrived within the gate, my ears were alarmed with
such a loud chorus of <HI>No mortals on earth are so happy as we,</HI> that
I began to think I had made a mistake; till observing its close
neighbourhood to the church convinced me, that this could be no other than the
Parsonage-House. On my entrance my friend (whom <PB N="633" REF="208"/> I
found in the midst of a room-full of fox-hunters in boots and bob wigs) got
up to welcome me to —, and em∣bracing me, gave me the full flavour of his
Stingo by belching in my face, as he did me the honour of saluting me. He
then introduced me to his friends, and placing me at the right hand of his own
elbow chair, assured them that I was a very <HI>honest Cock,</HI> and
loved a chace of five and twenty miles an end as well as any of them: to
preserve the credit of which character, I immediately complied, with an
injunction (though I must confess with less real rapture than a staunch
foxhunter) to toss off a pint bumper of Port, with the foot of the fox dipped
and squeezed into it to give a zest to the liquor.</P>
<P>BUT the whole oeconomy of <HI>Jack</HI>'s life is very
different from that of his brethren. Instead of having a wife and a
house-full of children, (the most common family of a country clergyman,) he
is single, unless we credit some idle whispers in the parish that he
is married to his housekeeper. The calm amusement of piquet, chess, and
back-gammon have no charms for <HI>Jack,</HI> who sees 
<Q REND="inline">"his dearest action in the field,"</Q> and
boasts that he has a brace of as good hunters in his stable, as ever leg
was laid over. Hunting and shoot∣ing are the only business of his life,
foxhounds and pointers lay about in every parlour, and he is himself like
<HI>Pistol,</HI> al∣ways in boots. The estimation in which he holds his
friends is rated according to their excellence as sportsmen; and to be able
to make a good shot or hunt a pack of hounds well, are admirable qualities.
His parishioners often earn a shil∣ling and a cup of ale at his house, by
coming to acquaint him, that they have found a hare sitting, or a fox in
cover. One day, while I was alone with my friend, the servant 
<PB N="634" REF="209"/> came in to tell him that the Clerk wanted to speak
with him. He was ordered in; but I could not help smiling when (instead of
giving notice of a burying, christening, or some other church business,
as I expected) I found the ho∣nest clerk only come to acquaint his reverend
superior, that there was a covey of partridges, of a dozen brace at least,
not above three fields from the house.</P>
<P>JACK's elder brother Sir <HI>Thomas Quickset,</HI> who
presented him with the benefice he now enjoys, is lord of the manor: so
that <HI>Jack</HI> has full power to beat up the game unmolested. He goes out
three times a week with his brother's hounds, whether Sir <HI>Thomas</HI> hunts
or not; and has besides a deputation from him as lord of the manor,
consigning the game to his care, and empowering him to take away all guns,
nets, and dogs from persons not duly qualified. <HI>Jack</HI> is more proud
of this office than many other country clergymen are of being in the
commission for the peace. Poaching is in his eye the most heinous crime
in the two tables; nor does the cure of souls appear to him half so
important a duty as the preservation of the Game.</P>
<P>SUNDAY, you may suppose, is as dull and tedious to this
ordained sportsman, as to any fine lady in town: not that he makes the
duties of his function any fatigue to him but as this day is necessarily a
day of rest from the usual toils of the chase. It happened, that the
first Sunday after I was with him he had engaged to take care of a Church, in
the absence of a neighbouring clergyman, which was about twenty miles off. I
engaged to accompany him: and the more to encourage me, he had assured me,
that we should ride over as fine a champaign open country as any in the 
<PB N="635" REF="210"/> <HI>North.</HI> Accordingly I was rouzed by him in the
morning before day-break by a loud hollowing of <HI>hark to Merriman,</HI> and
the repeated smacks of his half-hunter; and after we had fortified our
stomachs with several slices of hung beef and a horn or two of stingo,
we sallied forth. <HI>Jack</HI> was mounted upon a hunter, which he
assured me was never yet <HI>thrown out</HI>: and as we rode along, he
could not help lament∣ing that so fine a <HI>soft</HI> morning should be
thrown away upon a Sunday; at the same time remarking, that the dogs might
run breast high.</P>
<P>THOUGH we made the best of our way over hedge and ditch, and
<HI>took</HI> every thing, we were often delayed by trying if we could prick a
hare; or by leaving the road to examine a piece of cover; and he frequently
made me stop, not to look at the prospect, but while he pointed out the
particular course that <HI>Reynard</HI> took, or the spot where he had
<HI>earth'd.</HI> At length we arrived on full gallop at the Church, where we
found the congregation waiting for us: but as <HI>Jack</HI> had no∣thing to do
but to alight, pull his band out of the sermon∣case, give his brown
scratch bob a shake, and clap on the surplice, he was presently
equipped for the service. In short he behaved himself both in the desk
and pulpit to the entire satisfaction of all the parish as well as the
squire of it, who after thanking <HI>Jack</HI> for his excellent
discourse, very cor∣dially took us home to dinner with him.</P>
<P>I SHALL not trouble you with an account of our enter∣tainment
at the squire's, who being himself as keen a sports∣man as ever
followed a pack of dogs, was hugely delighted with <HI>Jack</HI>'s
conversation. <HI>Church and King,</HI> and another particular toast, were
(in compliment I suppose to my friend's <PB N="636" REF="211"/> clerical
character) the first drank after dinner; but these were directly followed
by a pint bumper to <HI>Horses sound, Dogs hearty. Earth stopt, and Foxes
plenty.</HI> When we had run over again, with great joy and vociferation, as
many chaces as the time would permit, the bell called us to even∣ing prayers:
after which, (though the squire would fain have had us stay and take an
hunt with him) we mounted our horses at the church-door, and rode home in the
dark; because <HI>Jack</HI> had engaged to meet several of his
brother-sportsmen, who were to lie all night at his own house, to be in
readiness to make up for the loss of Sunday, by going out a cock-shooting
very early the next morning.</P>
<P>I MUST leave it to you, Cousin, to make what reflec∣tions

<DIV2 TYPE="body of issue">
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>T is with the utmost pleasure that I have observed an
article in the news-papers, sig∣nifying that the magistrates of this city
will oblige all taverns, ale-houses, &amp;c. to be shut up to-morrow, which
is appointed to be set apart as a day of solemn fast and humiliation, on
account of those dreadful Earthquakes from which we have been so
providentially preserved. Without such a restriction it is to be feared,
that too many of the vulgar will observe this day in the same manner as
they are wont to observe the or∣dinary <PB N="638" REF="213"/> Sundays; which
they have been long accustomed to look upon as dedicated to Idleness and
Intemperance; to which deities they very devoutly pour their libations
(accord∣ing to their own phrase) in a <HI>church with a chimney in
it.</HI></P>
<P>BUT if the common herd are to be thus compelled to their duty,
persons of fashion, who are above the law, will I doubt pay as little
regard to this nominal fast-day, as to <HI>Ash-Wednesday,
Good-Friday,</HI> or the long-exploded 30th of <HI>January.</HI> Nor can we
expect, that it will work any greater reformation of manners in them, than the
absurd panic oc∣casioned formerly by the ridiculous predictions of a
<HI>Swiss</HI> madman. Therefore, as they are not to be frightened into a
sense of virtue and religion, we should rather try to wean them gradually
from their darling vices; which may be kept under by softening methods,
though we cannot hope wholly to eradicate them. For this purpose, the first
step to be previously taken, as it appears to me, should be to decoy
people of quality into coming to church, by making it as fashionable to be
seen there, as it was some time ago to meet at <HI>Ranelagh</HI> on a
Sunday. They must, therefore, be al∣lowed to curtesy, bow, nod, smile,
ogle, whisper, or even bawl to one another, before the service is begun;
and that churches may resemble other public places of diversion, ladies and
gentlemen may be permitted to send their servants to keep places in the
pews: but it shall on no consideration be lawful for them (as is their
custom at the opera or play-house) to disturb the congregation by
dropping in while the prayers are reading or to, interrupt the parson by
talking loud in the middle of the sermon.</P>
<P><PB N="639" REF="214"/>THIS point being once gained, it might be
possible to bring about some other reformations in the polite
amuse∣ments. Perhaps to banish all such moral plays as the
<HI>Chances</HI> for ever from our theatres, would be in effect to shut them
up, or condemn them to empty boxes: the polite world may, therefore, be
sometimes indulged with them <HI>at the particular desire of several
persons of quality</HI>; or for the be∣nefit of some hospital, when their
appearance may be attri∣buted to a motive of charity. Nor would I be so
scrupu∣lous as to abolish Masquerades entirely; though I would have them
put under new regulations: and no lady should be suffered to go there
half-naked under the pretence of being better disguised; nor should any
one be allowed to personate <HI>Eve,</HI> though with a fig-leaf. As to the
darling amusement of Gaming, I fear it would be a vain attempt to think of
restraining it within any bounds at present: nor is it possible to
expell the card-table from the routes of persons of fashion, even upon a
Sunday. I would therefore pro∣pose, that since they must play, the
winnings on that day should be given to the poor of the parish; and that
they should use a particular sort of cards (like those contrived for
the amusement and instruction of children) strewed with texts of
scripture and other religious and moral sentences.</P>
<P>GALLANTRY and intrigue may be likewise reckoned among the
fashionable amusements of the present age: and I confess I am at a
loss to know under what restrictions to confine them. Married people may
perhaps be allowed to indulge themselves in any freedoms, by the mutual
consent of each party; provided always, that they are persons of
distinction, and that the match between them was made merely on account of
family or fortune, in conformity to <PB N="640" REF="215"/> the true sense
and spirit of the late Marriage Act. With respect to those, who take a
pleasure in debauching raw country girls and common tradesmens daughters, I
had once a thought, that a clause should be added to the above∣mentioned
Act, to oblige the offenders to do penance in a white sheet; but I have
since considered, that our modern bucks and bloods would probably take as
much pride in this badge of honour, as a young officer in his scarf and
cockade. As to the genteel practice of keeping mistresses, no one
should be allowed to take a girl into keeping, but those who are already
past their grand climacteric, and may be supposed to want a nurse:
except it should be thought expedient to extend this privilege to those
spirited young fellows, who at the age of five and twenty have worn down
their constitutions to threescore.</P>
<P>WE cannot but admire the extreme courage and sense of
honour, which characterises our modern heroes, and inspires them
sometimes with a desire of killing their friends, and sometimes of
killing themselves. But as this noble spirit should be only exerted
against the common enemy, the honour of the Duellist might be satisfied,
I should think, by a mock-combat without bloodshed; and the courage of the
Suicide might be confined to a bare <HI>attempt</HI> on his own life, without
the loss of it. Duels, therefore, should be fought with guarded soils, as
in tragedy-rencounters; and any gentleman (or even mechanic) who finds an
inclination to make away with himself, may be allowed to try the expe∣riment,
by drawing a knife or razor across his throat so as not to cut the
wind-pipe, or by running a sword through the skin without piercing the
ribs; or he may flash a pistol in his face charged with powder only, or be
tucked up in his <PB N="641" REF="216"/> own garters with a wad of cotton about
his neck, and his nearest relation standing by, ready to cut him down (if
he pleases) before he be quite dead.</P>
<P>I am prevented from persuing this subject any farther, in
order to make room for the following letter.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>Mr. TOWN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS the day appointed, for a General Fast in these
king∣doms is now at hand, I shall beg leave to touch upon some laxities in
the usual manner of observing a Fast; which though they are not of
sufficient dignity to be taken notice of from the pulpit, should yet be
pointed out, as the vio∣lation of the Fast in these particulars is almost
universal.</P>
<P>THE very name of a Fast implies a day of abstinence, of
mortification and self-denial; which has always been in∣joined as a
necessary means of subduing irregular desires, and fitting us for holy
meditations. For this reason, in former days, when people of quality rose
earlier than even mecha∣nics now open their shops, when the Court itself
dined at eleven, that meal was deferred till four o'clock in compliance with
this religious exercise, which was in those times a real abstinence, a
true piece of mortification and self-denial. But if the observance of a
Fast consists in not dining till four o'clock, our persons of fashion
may be said to fast every day of their lives. In truth, the several hours
of the day are adapted to such very different employments to what they were
formerly, that our four o'clock stands in the place of their eleven: and
nothing can be more absurd (to use no harsher term) than to adhere to the
form in the performance of a religious act, when by the alteration of
circumstances, <PB N="642" REF="217"/> that form flatly contradicts the very
meaning of its original institution. I would also ask those rigid
devotees, who ob∣serve this day in all the strictness of the letter, and
would be shocked at sight of a leg of mutton or beef-steak on their
tables, whether the dining upon salt or other fish, may not be considered
rather as feasting than fasting, if (as is often the case) it should
happen to be a dish they are remarkably fond of. All these methods of
keeping a Fast without absti∣nence, mortification, or self-denial, are
mere quibbles to evade the performance of our duty, and entirely frustrate
the design of appointing this solemnity. There is some∣thing of this
nature very commonly practised in <HI>France:</HI> where there are many
families who keep the whole Lent with great strictness; but the last
night of it invite a great deal of company to supper. The moment the clock
strikes twelve, a magnificent entertainment, consisting of all sorts of
rich fare, is served up, and these most Christian debauchees sit down
to indulge in luxury, without sinning against the Canon.</P>

<DATE><HI>Jan.</HI> 30<HI>th</HI> 1756.</DATE></DATELINE> 
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> HAVE just now, with near an hundred more, taken the
first degree, which this University confers on her sons; and begin to
consider within myself, in what manner we have spent our time for these
four years past, and what profit we are likely to receive hereafter from
these our academical studies: But upon retrospection I find that
instead of having laid up a store of learning, which might have been of
service to us in our future connections and intercourse with mankind, we
have been confounding our heads with a miscellaneous heap of nonsense,
which most of us, I am certain, are endeavouring to unlearn as 
<PB N="644" REF="219"/> fast as possible we can: instead of having
acquired such a share of common sense, as might have been of service
to ourselves and acquaintance, we must entirely sell off our old stock,
and begin the world of literature anew. This re∣flection cannot be very
pleasing to those, who I must say have squandered away so very
precious a time of life; a time of life, when, though judgment perhaps is not
come to maturity, yet imagination and invention, those noble off∣springs of
a promising mind, are in the very flower and bloom of perfection.</P>
<P>THIS seat of learning (for it undoubtedly deserves that
name) has drawn and kept us together for some years; our manners,
conversation, and studies bear a great similitude: but now either chance
or choice is going to disperse us over the whole kingdom; and our places of
abode will scarcely be more widely different, than our schemes of life.
Notwithstanding this, the same plan of study has been im∣posed on all:
Whether agreeable, or contrary to the bent of inclination, has never been
regarded. Mathematics is the standard, to which all merit is referred; and
all the excellencies, without these, are quite overlooked and neg∣lected: the
solid learning of <HI>Greece</HI> and <HI>Rome</HI> is a trifling
acquisition; and much more so, every polite accomplishment: in short,
if you will not get all <HI>Euclid</HI> and his diagrams by heart, and pore
over <HI>Saunderson</HI> 'till you are as blind as he was himself, they
will say of you, as in the motto to one of your late papers, <HI>actum est,
ilicet, peristi.</HI> Not that I would depreciate this kind of learning; it
is certainly a most noble science, and reflects the greatest honour on
human wit and invention: all that I complain of, is the unreason∣able
stress that is laid upon it; nay even the more abstruse 
<PB N="645" REF="220"/> parts of it: which is still more absurd, as there
are so very few heads able to perceive and retain the nice chain of
reasoning and deduction, which must necessarily be made use of, and
as a small number of mathematical geniusses would be sufficient for the
service of his Majesty's dominions.</P>
<P>I TAKE it for granted, that your sagacity has by this time
discovered, that you have been addressed by a young man, whose
too-overweening conceit of himself has, perhaps, in∣duced him to imagine,
that the University has not suffi∣ciently rewarded his deserts. If so,
you are not deceived: but though this disappointment may at present set a
little uneasy upon me, yet I think I can foresee, that it will be the
most fortunate mortification that could possibly have befallen me. For,
in the first place, it has sufficiently abated that upstart pride, which
most young men are apt to take in their own abilities; than which nothing can
be more insufferable to all their acquaintance, or a greater impediment to
their own real improvement. A pert scholar, whenever he enters a room of
company, immediately assumes a superiority in discourse, and thinks
himself obliged to correct all impro∣prieties in thought or expression.
You must 
<Q REND="inline">"speak by the card,"</Q> as <HI>Hamlet</HI>
says, or expect the censure of this super∣ficial coxcomb. If, according
to the common form of speech, you say that there is either heat in fire, or
coldness in ice, he will inform you, that you deliver yourself very
inaccurately, as Mr. <HI>Locke</HI> has fully demonstrated; he will tell you,
you cannot prove, that two and two make four, or that you are alive yourself.
These, and a thousand other equally impertinent observations, he is
continually making, to the no small uneasiness and perplexity of the
ladies, and honest country gentlemen.</P>
<P><PB N="646" REF="221"/>WHAT is still a greater misfortune, is
that a man of this cast is never likely to know any better: for having raked
together a few metaphysical distinctions and scholastic re∣finements,
he thinks, he has laid up a sufficient fund of knowledge for his whole life:
he despises all common sense (which is the best sense) through an
ambition of appearing particular; and as for the advice or opinion of others,
those he thinks himself indispensably bound to disregard; inas∣much
as such submission implies some inferiority, which he would by no
means be thought to labour under. Such a disposition as this, I take to be
the sure and infallible token of confirmed ignorance: a melancholy instance
of the de∣pravity of human nature, that the less we know, the more we
presume; and the fewer advances we have made to∣wards true knowledge, the
less occasion we think we have of any further improvement.</P>
<P>IN the second place, if I may be allowed to judge of what I
cannot possibly have experienced, I take it to be the greatest benefit to
a young person to meet with early disap∣pointments in life: for sooner or
later every one must have his share of them; and the sooner we meet with
some of them, the better: for by this means the mind is easily made
familiar with crosses and vexations, and is not thrown off its balance by
every thwarting and wayward accident. By this means, we submit to ills and
troubles, as the necessary attendants on mankind; just as on a rainy day
we make ourselves quiet and contented, but hope for sunshine on the
morrow. And, indeed, there seems to be a strong analogy between the
inclemency of the weather attacking our bo∣dies, and the storms of
afflictions which batter our minds. <PB N="647" REF="222"/> The rain will beat,
and the wind will roar, let us use our utmost endeavours to the contrary;
but by enuring our per∣sons to the vicissitudes of the seasons, and
using other pro∣per methods, we shall feel no very sensible
inconvenience from them: In like manner all our skill and art cannot prevent
or elude the rubs and disasters to which we are lia∣ble; but if by degrees,
and early in life, we are hardened and accustomed to them, and if by the help
of reason and sound philosophy we arm and fortify ourselves against
them, they may still perhaps reach us; but their shocks will be quite weak
and languid, and we may say of Fortune, as <HI>Virgil</HI> says of
<HI>Priam</HI> when he hurled a javelin at <HI>Pyrrhus,</HI> 
<Q> 
<L>—Telum imbelle sine ictu</L> 
<L>Conjecit—</L></Q> THUS you see, Mr. TOWN, that out
of a seeming evil, I have discovered a real good: and I am certain, if this
me∣thod of reasoning could be made universal, we should find much fewer

<P>I Am so great an admirer of the fair sex, that I never let
a tittle of their vendible writings escape me. I bought this year the
<HI>Lady</HI>'s <HI>Diary,</HI> merely because it was adver∣tised as the
<HI>Woman</HI>'s <HI>Almanack,</HI> which I construed, the Al∣manack
composed by a Woman: but I find I have been mistaken in my supposition.
It is not the work of a female. The Christian name of the author, I have
reason to believe, is <HI>Marmaduke</HI>; unless I misunderstand a
most curious copy of verses, describing a most superb entertainment,
of fish, flesh, pies, and tarts, exhibited upon New Year's Day 1755. His
Sirname remains as great an Aenigma as any in his book. His coadjutors,
contributers, or assistants are Messieurs <HI>Walter Trott, Timothy
Nabb, Patrick Ocavannah, John Honey,</HI> <PB N="648" REF="223"/> <HI>Henry
Season,</HI> and others. I honour these gentlemen, and their works; but I

<HI>Nancy Evelyn,</HI> Miss <HI>E. S.</HI> Miss <HI>Atkinson, Enira,</HI>
and other choice little feminine spirits of the age. Riddles are so
becoming, and appear so pretty, when dandled about by ladies, that they may
be compared to soft, smooth, painted waxen babbies, dressed up in a
pro∣per manner for Misses to play with, from eighteen to four∣score. But
above all I must take this opportunity of congra∣tulating dear Miss
<HI>Fanny Harris,</HI> who, I find, 
<Q REND="inline">"<HI>has given an elegant Solution to a Prize
Problem by a Fluxionary Cal∣culus founded on the Properties of

Diaries for this important year 1756. As this young lady is justly called the

in the Properties of Tangents, I fear she will never descend so low as
<HI>Riddleme Riddlemeree,</HI> and therefore I must humbly offer, by the

<SALUTE>Mr. TOWN!</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU must know, Sir, in my younger days I was very
susceptible of the passion of love: my heart was al∣ways fluttering,
jumping, and skipping, when a female object was in view: and being a pretty
good master of that <PB N="650" REF="225"/> kind of romantic nonsense,
with which the fair are too often captivated; being fond of dancing,
frisking, capering, and fidgeting to all public places; I gained the
affections of many, but could settle to none: and my heart constantly
returned to its owner with the wound healed.</P>
<P>IN this manner I lived till I grew past forty; and think∣ing
such kind of life not so agreeable, but rather fatiguing, I came to a
resolution to marry, and settle quietly in the world the remainder of my
days. You may guess from my general acquaintance, I could not be a great
while before I had an opportunity offered of meeting something suitable to
my inclinations: accordingly I fixed my mind on a widow lady about ten years
younger than myself; to whom I made known my intentions as soon as I could.
I was received in such a manner as all happy lovers would wish to be: and
at last got her promise for the completion: but when I pres∣sed the
day, was told it could not be so soon as I desired; for to surrender on
so short a courtship, the world might impute as an indecorum in her
character.</P>
<P>I MUST tell you, I soon found (like <HI>Malvolio</HI> in the
play) that she had a great passion for white silk stockings; and you
may be sure I always dressed my legs in that colour: but as ill luck
would have it, some little time since, having stayed with her pretty
late, and not being able to get either coach or chair, I was forced to trudge
home in the rain, my cursed white stockings were wet from top to bottom;
the next morning the rheumatism took possession of one of my knees,
which not only caused an hobble in my gait, but obliged me to cloath my legs
with thick ribb'd worsted for the sake of warmth.</P>
<P><PB N="651" REF="226"/>THUS hobbling and cloathed, I went to
visit my charmer, who as I entered the room was sitting in her chair more
grave than usual; which I imputed to her attention to do∣mestic affairs,
and sat down by her. I took hold of her hand, and was going to intrude on her
lips for a kiss—But would you think it, Mr. TOWN! instead of
suffering my sa∣lute, she reclined her head on the chair; drew her hand
from mine; held it up as a bar between us; arose; and told me I must take
no such liberties in future. I expostulated; and was for attempting again,
imagining it was only a whim, (for you well know they all have their whims) but
to my great misfortune found it was real. She resumed her place; and in a
grave manner told me, I must think no more of what had passed between us;
that she should al∣ways have a regard for me, but was determined not to
marry; and therefore expected I should from that time for∣bear all further
pretension. I earnestly (as you can make no doubt) pressed for
reasons, but could get none except broken hints; such as—I would not
have you marry—It may hurt your constitution, which seems to be very
delicate—I cannot turn Nurse—We shall not answer each others
expectations—and without any further or other ceremony, she quitted the
room with all the haughty airs of a fine lady, who knows she has the man
totally in her power.</P>
<P>OH Mr. TOWN! imagine what a confused situation I was in: I
was thunder-struck: I was over-whelmed with horror and astonishment: I
stood like the Soldier when he beheld the shocking condition of his General
<HI>Bellisarius.</HI> After being a long time in that condition, I a little
recovered my senses; and with much difficulty prevailed on her maid, to 
<PB N="652" REF="227"/> follow her to her retreat; and to beg the favour only to
speak to her. That was denied me; I was told her determination was fixed;
she expected I would obey it; and that she should be absent when I came
again.</P>
<P>I AM at present uncertain what to do: I shall therefore be
obliged to you, if you will advise me, (as I can prove a promise of
marriage) whether I shall put the affair into the hands of my attorney: or
whether I shall stay till the warm weather comes (which I imagine will
carry off my rheu∣matism) and attack her again: or whether I shall pocket
the disappointment, and think no more of matrimony. Give me some
consolation if you can: but if you have none, I desire, for the good of
young batchelors like myself, you would ad∣vise them all between forty and
fifty not to wear white stock∣ings in winter.</P>

<P>AS there are some vices, which the vulgar have pre∣sumed
to copy from the great, so there are others, which the great have
condescended to borrow from the vul∣gar. Among these I cannot but set
down the black-guard practice (for so I must call it) of Cursing and
Swearing: a practice, which (to say nothing at present of its
profaneness) is low and indelicate, and places a man of quality on the same
level with the chairman at his door. For my own part I cannot see the
difference between a <HI>By Gad</HI> or a <HI>Dem-me</HI> minced and softened
by a gentle pronunciation from well-bred lips, and the same expression
bluntly bolted out from the broad mouth of a carman or an oyster-wench.</P>
<P><PB N="653" REF="228"/>YOUR predecessor the SPECTATOR has
given us an account of a select party of Swearers, who were extremely
surprised at their own common talk, which was taken down in short∣hand,
and afterwards repeated to them. In like manner, if we were to draw out a
catalogue of fashionable Oaths and Curses in present use at
<HI>Arthur</HI>'s or any other polite assembly, would not the company
themselves be led to imagine, that the conversation had been carried on
between the lowest of the mob? Would they not blush to find, that they had
gleaned their choicest phrases from streets and allies, and en∣riched
their discourse by the elegant dialect of <HI>Wapping</HI> or <HI>Broad
Saint Giles</HI>'s?</P>
<P>I SHALL purposely wave making any reflections on the
im∣piety of this practice, as I am satisfied they would have but little
weight either with the <HI>beau-monde</HI> or the <HI>canaille.</HI> The
Swearer of either station devotes himself piece-meal (as it were) to
destruction; pours out anathemas against his eyes, his heart, his soul,
and every part of his body; and extends the same good wishes to the limbs
and joints of his friends and acquaintance. This they both do with the same
fearless unconcern; but with this difference only, that the
Gentle∣man-Swearer damns himself and others with the greatest ci∣vility and
good-breeding imaginable.</P>
<P>I KNOW it will be pleaded in excuse for this practice, that
Oaths and Curses are intended only as mere expletives, to fill up and give a
grace to conversation: but as there are still some old-fashioned
creatures, who adhere to their common acceptation, it would be proper to
substitute some other un∣meaning terms in their room, and at the same
time remote from the vulgar Cursing and Swearing. A worthy clergy∣man 
<PB N="654" REF="229"/> (whose name I cannot recollect) being chaplain of a
regiment, is said to have reclaimed the officers, who were much addicted to
the vulgar idiom of swearing, by taking occasion to tell them a story, in
which he introduced the words <HI>bottle and glass,</HI> instead of the

<DIV2 TYPE="body of issue">
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>T is not easy for the mind of man to recover itself from
any extraordinary panic which has once seized it: for this reason we
can∣not be surprised, that many well-meaning people, who have not yet
shook off the ap∣prehensions occasioned by the late dreadful earthquakes,
should be led to conjure up new terrors, and alarm them∣selves with
imaginary dangers. Their fears interpret every common incident, and even the
change of weather, as signs of approaching destruction: if the day be calm
and serene, such (they say) is the usual fore-runner of a shock; or
if the <PB N="656" REF="231"/> night prove tempestuous, they can hardly
persuade them∣selves that it is only the wind which rocks their houses.
With this propensity to entertain any unreasonable dread about future
events, it is no wonder, that weak minds should be further worked upon by
little dablers in philoso∣phy; who having gleaned a few barren scraps from
the Magazines, presume even to foretell the dissolution of the world by
the Comet which will appear in 1758. <HI>Swift,</HI> in his <HI>Voyage to
Laputa,</HI> has a passage so very apposite to these idle pretenders
to science, that I shall beg leave to transcribe it.</P>
<Q> 
<P> THESE people (says he) are under continual disqui∣etudes,
never enjoying a minute's peace of mind; and their disturbances proceed from
causes, which very little affect the rest of mortals. Their apprehensions
arise from several changes they dread in the celestial bodies. For
instance, that the earth by the continual approaches of the sun towards it
must in course of time be absorbed, or swallowed up. That the face of
the sun will by degrees be encrusted with its own effluvia, and give no
more light to the world. That the earth very narrowly escaped a brush from
the last comet, which would have infallibly reduced it to ashes; and that
the next, which they have calculated for one and thirty years hence, will
probably de∣stroy us. For, if in its perihelion it should approach with∣in
a certain degree of the sun (as by their calculations they have reasons to
dread) it will receive a degree of heat ten thousand times more intense,
than that of red hot glowing iron; and, in its absence from the sun carry a
blazing tail ten hundred thousand and fourteen miles long; through which if
the earth should pass at the distance of one hun∣dred thousand miles
from the <HI>nucleus,</HI> or main body of <PB N="657" REF="232"/> the comet, it
must in its passage be set on fire, and re∣duced to ashes. That the
sun, daily spending its rays without any nutriment to supply them, will
at last be wholly consumed and annihilated; which must be attend∣ed with
the destruction of this earth and of all the planets that receive their light
from it.</P> 
<P> THEY are so perpetually alarmed with the apprehensions of
these, and the like impending dangers, that they can neither sleep quietly
in their beds, nor have any relish for the common pleasures or amusements
of life. When they meet an acquaintance in the morning, the first question
is about the sun's health, how he looked at his setting and rising, and
what hopes they have to avoid the stroke of an approaching comet. This
conversation they are apt to run into with the same temper, that boys
discover to hear terrible stories of spirits and hobgoblins, which they
greedily listen to, and dare not go to bed for fear.</P></Q>
<P>LET us therefore banish from our thoughts all such vain
notions, and let us fortify our minds with a true sense of religion, which
will teach us to rely on the protection of that providence, which has hitherto
preserved us. It is with great pleasure, that I remarked the unanimous
concur∣rence of all ranks of people, in observing the late solemn Fast,
as a necessary act of humiliation, to avert the wrath and vengeance of
heaven, and to call down its mercies upon us: nor do I doubt, but the
approaching Season will awaken in us the same serious attention to our
duty; that we may not seem to have barely complied with a stated form, or
to have been affected with the short-lived piety of a single day.</P>
<P><PB N="658" REF="233"/>IT is true, indeed, that no persons do
more prejudice to the cause of religion, than they who cloud its genuine
chearfulness with the gloom of superstition, and are apt to consider
every common accident that befalls us, as a judg∣ment. They cloath religion in
the most terrifying habit, and (as it were, dress it up in all the horrors
of the Inquisition. These people are much to be pitied; and it is to be
wished, that their mistaken piety could be better regulated. But there is
another set of men of a different turn, more nume∣rous and much more
dangerous to the community, who treat every act of religion as a jest, and
hold its most sacred ordinances in contempt. Set forms and ceremonies,
though they have no essential virtue in themselves, are yet
indispen∣sably requisite to keep alive in us a quick sense of our
duty. It must be allowed, indeed, that if a man could constantly employ his
mind in holy meditations, exercise the virtues, and believe the mysteries
of our religion, he would be a true Christian, though he never complied with
any outward forms, or so much as repeated a single prayer. But it is
manifest from experience, that those who neglect the ordi∣nances, neglect
also the duties of a Christian; and the least reflection on the human
mind will convince us, that some external rites are necessary to settle
the wandering ideas, and to fix the attention on its proper object. The fervent
re∣petition of a prayer is apt to inspire us with love and gra∣titude towards
the DEITY, and kindles the sparks of devo∣tion within us: and it is easy to
conceive, that if the cele∣bration of public worship was neglected among us
only for one year, it would be a more fatal blow to religion than all the weak
attacks of infidels and free-thinkers. No argu∣ments, therefore, could be more
ill-grounded than the ob∣jections <PB N="659" REF="234"/> of those people, who
considered the appointment of the late solemn fast as useless and
unnecessary.</P>
<P>BUT though forms may be said to compose the body, a good
life is the soul of religion, without which the rest is but a dead mass.
The most rigid compliance with every ordinance of the Church, if it has no
influence on our con∣duct, is rather a solemn mockery than an attonement for
our offences: as they, who receive the bread and wine without a firm
resolution to lead a new life, are said to eat and drink their own
damnation: Wherefore, a strict observance of this or that particular day is
not a sufficient discharge of our duty, except it serve to rouze us from
the lethargy of sin, to awaken in us a desire of becoming worthy the
protection of the ALMIGHTY, by animating our faith, amending our lives, and
working in us a repentance of our transgressions. Thus the Lord's Day is
not merely set apart for devotion, with an unlimited licence to wickedness
all the rest of the week; but our being particularly exercised in acts of
piety for one day, is calculated to strengthen our virtue, and to give a
tincture of religion to our whole conduct through the other six.</P>
<P>THESE considerations I have thought fit to lay before the
reader, as preparatory to another solemn Fast ordained by the Church: and
if the observance of this should be neg∣lected or slightly passed
over, may we not conclude, that our sense of religion is only in proportion
to our sense of danger? As for those, who require constantly to be
fright∣ened into their duty, I will for once venture to commence prophet: and
let them be assured that my predictions will in∣fallibly come to pass.
There is a danger, more certain than an <PB N="660" REF="235"/> Earthquake or a
Comet, which will inevitably overwhelm us; from which we cannot possibly
guard ourselves, and which perhaps is even now at our doors. This danger I
cannot better set forth, than in the alarming words of a ce∣lebrated
<HI>French</HI> preacher. 
<Q REND="inline">"I know a man (and I will point him out
presently) who is now in this church; a man, in perfect health; a man, in the
flower of his age: And yet this man, perhaps before next Sunday, perhaps by
to-morrow, will be in his grave. This man, my dear brethren, is Myself who
speak to you, it is You who hear me."</Q></P>

<OPENER>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">E</SEG>VERY <HI>Englishman,</HI> who has the good of his country
at heart, must lament the per∣plexity which our ministers labour under, in
contriving ways and means to raise money for the present exigence of
affairs. I have with pleasure hearkened to the several projects proposed
in the debates of patriots in our coffee-houses and private clubs: but though
I find they are unanimous in allowing the neces∣sity of levying new taxes,
every one is willing to shift off the burthen from himself.</P>
<P><PB N="662" REF="237"/>I WAS introduced the other night into a
set of worthy citi∣zens, who very zealously took this subject into
consideration over their evening pipe. One of them a grave gentleman, pulling
the <HI>Evening Post</HI> out of his pocket, and putting on his spectacles,
read aloud to us the several methods already proposed; to which many wise
objections were immediately started by the company. 
<Q REND="inline">"What's that? says an old don, (who I
afterwards found had a small estate in houses) An additional duty upon
bricks, and pan-tiles, and plain-tiles, I suppose they will lay a tax upon
plain-tile-pegs by and bye?"</Q> This speech was received with an hearty
chuckle of applause from the rest of the company; when another took
occasion to observe, 
<Q REND="inline">"that he very much approved the scheme for
laying a larger tax upon cards and dice; one of which he called the <HI>devil's
books,</HI> and the other his <HI>bones.</HI>"</Q> The duty upon plate might
perhaps have passed into a law in this assembly, if it had not been
vehe∣mently opposed by one member, (whom I discovered to be a
silver-smith,) in which he was seconded by the landlord of the house,
who had a seat in this meeting, and told us, 
<Q REND="inline">"that it would lye very hard upon publicans,
as nobody would now drink their porter out of a pewter-pot."</Q> These and
the like arguments induced us to set aside all the pro∣jects, that had been
offered hitherto and to consult together in order to find new ones in their
room; among which I could not but smile at the proposal of an honest
peruke-ma∣ker, who advised the levying of a poll-tax upon all that wore their
own hair, 
<Q REND="inline">"For, says he, we have never had good times,
since wigs were out of fashion. What rare days were those in Queen
<HI>Anne</HI>'s reign, when the nobility and gentry wore large flaxen flows of
thirty guineas price! And <PB N="663" REF="238"/> as you may see in my lord
<HI>Godolphin</HI>'s monument in <HI>West∣minster</HI> Abby, a prime
minister's wig, could not be made, I am sure, under fifty guineas."</Q></P>
<P>THE discourse that passed at this society of
politicians has led me to turn my thoughts on devising some method, that
might answer the present demands for a supply, with the least injury to
the community. On this account I am of Opinion that private vices (according to
the favourite tenet of <HI>Maun∣derville)</HI> may in some measure be
converted into public benefits, by laying a certain tax or duty on the
fashionable amusements of the gay and polite world. For this purpose I
have with great pains and labour contrived a plan, a few heads of which,
without further preface, I shall (with your leave) submit to the
consideration of those whom it may concern.</P>
<P>FIRST then, I would propose, that no persons of quality,
or others, should be allowed to keep any route, drum, as∣sembly,
visiting-day, (or whatever other name it may here∣after be called by,) at
which more than one hundred persons shall be found assembled, without
paying a certain rate for every such route, drum, &amp;c. The number of
these meet∣ings, which are held in this town, (including the city of
<HI>London</HI> and the suburbs thereof) I have computed, upon an exact
calculation, to amount annually to eight thousand three hundred and upwards;
so that if a duty, at only six-pence <HI>per</HI> head, were to be levied
upon the company, it would bring in a prodigious income to the government;
deducting for the decrease consequent of this tax, as also for those
which we may expect will be smuggled or carried on clandes∣tinely. And as
gaming is an essential diversion at all these meetings, I would further
advise, that every card-table be <PB N="664" REF="239"/> marked and numbered,
in the same manner as waggons and coaches, and a proportionable rate fixed on
them according to the degree and quality of the owners. Be it enacted moreover,
that extraordinary licences shall be taken out for playing at cards on the
Sabbath-day; but that these be granted only to persons of the highest
rank and fashion.</P>
<P>AT the present juncture of affairs every one will agree with
me, that if an absolute prohibition be impracticable, an heavy duty should
be laid on the importation of <HI>French</HI> fashions and fopperies into
this kingdom. It is therefore but reasonable, that all <HI>French</HI> cooks,
valets de chambre, mil∣liners, mantua-makers, hair-cutters, &amp;c. should be
at least doubly taxed, as it is notorious that they exact from the dupes, who
employ them, more than double the wages or price for their labours, that our
own modest countrymen would re∣quire. This tax I make no doubt, would produce
no incon∣siderable sum for the public use: and as our ladies, though I
would not suspect that they have <HI>French</HI> hearts, are ambi∣tious of
wearing <HI>French</HI> complexions, a further sum might also be raised
by fixing an high duty upon <HI>rouge</HI> and <HI>carmine.</HI></P>
<P>I SHALL not dwell on other particulars, which might be turned
in the same manner to the public good; such as a tax on kept
mistresses, for example, which practice is now become so generally
fashionable, that I question not but a duty properly levied on them would
be sufficient to maintain all the widows of our soldiers and sailors, who
shall happen to be killed in the service. But as it is incumbent on every
<HI>Englishman</HI> to expose his life in defence of his country against
the common enemy, I must particularly re∣commend, that some means may be
devised, that the gallant <PB N="665" REF="240"/> feats of those men of
honour, who rather chuse to risk their lives in the modish way of
duelling, may be attended with some advantage to their countrymen. I would
therefore ad∣vise, that swords and pistols of a settled length and
bore, with the Tower-stamp, be provided by the government for the use of
Duellists, and that they shall not presume to make use of any other,
under pain of incurring the guilt of murder. These weapons may be let out at
a certain price; and if one of the parties happen to kill the other, the
sur∣vivor shall be subject to a fine according to his rank and station,
and a jury shall be directed to bring in the ver∣dict, <HI>Self-Defence.</HI>
In like manner, persons of quality may have leave granted them to put an end
to their own lives, after an ill luck at cards, or the like emergent
occa∣sions; when, upon paying a certain rate, they may be in∣dulged in a
private execution from the hands of <HI>Jack Ketch,</HI> and the Coroner's
inquest shall be directed to bring in their verdict, <HI>Lunacy.</HI></P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE generality of the young unmarried ladies of the present
age dislike no company so much as the elderly persons of their own sex,
whether married or unmarried. Go∣ing with an old maiden aunt, a mamma, or
grand-mamma to the play, or to <HI>Ranelagh,</HI> is so insipid an
amusement, that it robs their entertainment of the very name of a party of
pleasure. To be handed into a box, walk in the public gardens, or make one at
a card-table at a route, with a sprightly young nobleman, or gallant colonel
of the guards, has some life in it; but to be kept perpetually under the wing
of an old lady, can have no charms for a woman of spirit. The presence of
these antiquated females imposes a constraint on their behaviour: they
are, indeed, like the <PB N="668" REF="243"/> <HI>Duennas</HI> in
<HI>Spain,</HI> spies on the conduct of the gay and young; and a good old
gentlewoman with a young beauty by her side watches her every motion, and is
as much frighted, if the pretty creature makes any advances to a man, as a hen,
who has been foster-mother to a brood of duck∣lings, is alarmed at their
taking to the water.</P>
<P>BUT though a loose coquet behaviour is so much in vogue, a
modest deportment is most natural and becoming in the fair sex; and I am
always glad to see a young lady of sufficient sense and discretion,
to behave with an innocent chearfulness, instead of apparent uneasiness
and constraint, before her more aged female friends and relations. But though
a daughter should prefer no company to her mother, a son would appear as
ridiculous, if he always dangled at the side of his mamma, as if he wore his
sister's petticoats: and however amiable this maidenly demeanor might
seem in a young girl, I cannot view it with equal approbation in the
character of a Male-Virgin;—a character, with which I shall here
present the reader, as drawn by one of my cor∣respondents.</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>To Mr. TOWN.</HEAD>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU have already given us several instances of those
am∣biguous creatures among the men, who are both male and female: permit me to
add to them an account of those lady-like gentlemen, whom we may
distinguish by the title of <HI>their mother's own sons</HI>; who have in
vain changed the bib and leading-strings for the breeches, and stick as
close to their mammas, as a great calf to the side of an old cow. I am
intimately acquainted with one of these over-grown ba∣bies; 
<PB N="669" REF="244"/> who is indeed too big to be dandled in lap, or fed with
a pap-spoon, though he is no more weaned from his mother, than if he had not
yet quitted the nursery.</P>
<P>THE delicate BILLY SUCKLING is the contempt of the men, the
jest of the women, and the darling of his mamma. She doats on him to
distraction; and is in perpetual admi∣ration of his wit, and anxiety for his
health. The good young gentleman, for his part, is neither undutiful nor
un∣grateful: she is the only woman, that he does not look on with
indifference; and she is his tutoress, his physician, and his nurse.
She provides his broth every evening, will not suffer him to look into a book
by candle-light, lest he should hurt his eyes; and takes care to have his
bed warmed: nay, I have known him sit with his mamma's white hand∣kerchief
round his neck through a whole visit, to guard him from the wind of that
<HI>ugly door,</HI> or that <HI>terrible chink in the wainscot.</HI></P>
<P>BUT however familiarly he may behave in his addresses to
his mother, and whatever little acts of gallantry may pass between them, no
encouragement can prevail on him to treat other women with the same freedom.
Being once de∣sired at a ball to dance a minuet, instead of taking out any
of the young ladies, he could pitch upon no partner so agree∣able, to whom he
might offer the compliment of his hand, as his mother; and I remember, when he
was once called upon in a large company at a tavern to give a lady in his turn,
he plainly shewed who was the sole mistress of his affections, by
toasting his mother. The gallant custom of challenging a lady to drink a
bumper, by leaving it to her option whether she will have <HI>hob</HI> or
<HI>nob,</HI> frequently gives a <PB N="670" REF="245"/> delicious flavour to
the liquor, especially when, as I have known it happen, joining the lips of
the glasses has made the prelude to a meeting between the lips of the
parties: but he could not be prevailed on to accept a glass of claret from
the fairest hand, though a kiss were sure to follow it. I have known him
so very nice, as to refuse a glass of sack filled with walnuts, which
had been peeled by the snowy fingers of a beautiful young lady; though I have
seen him smack his lips after a glass of raisin wine, in which his
prudent mother had been dabbling with her snuffy finger, in order to fish
out the small particles of cork, which might possibly have choaked him.
If a lady drops her fan, he sits without any emotion, and suffers her to
stoop for it herself; or if she strikes her tea-cup against the
saucer to give notice that it is empty, he pays no regard to the signal,
but sees her walk up to the tea-table, without stirring from his chair. He
would rather leave the most celebrated beauty, in crossing the street,
to the mercy of a drayman, than trust her with his little finger: though at
the same time should his mother be so distressed, he would not
scruple to bear as much of her weight as he could stand under, and to
redeem her silk stockings from jeopardy would even expose his own.</P>
<P>ONE would imagine, that this extreme coyness and re∣serve,
in which he so remarkably differs from the generality of his own sex, would
in another respect as effectually distin∣guish him from the generality of
women: I mean, that being less polite in his address than a footman, we
should hardly ex∣pect to find him more loquacious than a chambermaid. But
this is really the case. Suffer him to take the lead in conver∣sation, and
there are certain topicks, in which the most <PB N="671" REF="246"/> prating
gossip at a christening would find it difficult to cope with him. The
strength of his constitution is his favourite theme: he is constantly
attempting to prove, that he is not susceptible of the least injury from
cold; though a hoarse∣ness in his voice, and the continual interruptions of
a con∣sumptive cough, give him the lye in his throat at the end of every
sentence. The instances, indeed, by which he endeavours to prove his
hardiness, unluckily rather tend to convince us of the delicacy of his frame,
as they seldom amount to more, than his having kicked off the bed-choaths in
his sleep, laid aside one of his flannel waistcoats in a hot day, or
tried on a new pair of pumps before they had been sufficiently aired. For the
truth of these facts he always appeals to his mamma, who vouches for him with
a sigh, and protests that his carelessness would ruin the
constitution of a horse.</P>
<P>I AM now coming to the most extraordinary part of his
character. This pusillanimous creature thinks himself, and would be
thought, a Buck. The noble fraternity of that order find, that their reputation
can be no otherwise main∣tained, than by prevailing on an <HI>Irish</HI>
chairman now and then to favour them with a broken head, or by conferring the
same token of their esteem on the unarmed and defence∣less waiters at a
tavern. But these exploits are by no means suited to the disposition of
our hero: and yet he always looks upon his harmless exploits as the bold
frolicks of a Buck. If he escapes a nervous fever a month, he is quite a
Buck: if he walks home after it is dark, without his mamma's maid to attend
him, he is quite a Buck: if he sits up an hour later than his usual time,
or drinks a glass or two of wine without water, he calls it a debauch; and
because his <PB N="672" REF="247"/> head does not ache the next morning, he is
quite a Buck. In short, a woman of the least spirit within the precincts
of <HI>St. James</HI>'s would demolish him in a week, should be pretend to
keep pace with her in her irregularities: and yet he is ever dignifying
himself with the appellation of a Buck.</P>
<P>NOW might it not be giving this gentleman a useful hint, Mr.
TOWN, to assure him, that while milk and water is his darling liquor, a
Bamboo cane his Club, and his mother the sole object of his affections, the
world will never join in denominating him a Buck: That if he fails in this
attempt, he is absolutely excluded from every order in society; for
whatever his deserts may be, no assembly of antiquated virgins can ever
acknowledge him for a sister, nature having as deplorably disqualified
him for that rank in the commu∣nity, as he has disqualified himself for
every other: And that, though he never can arrive at the dignity of leading
apes in hell, he may possibly be condemn'd to dangle in that capacity, at
the apron-string of an old maid in the next world, for having so abominably
resembled one in this.</P>

<HEAD>To Mr. <HI>TOWN.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>T has for a long time been observable that the ladies
heads have run much upon wheels, but of late there has appeared a strange
kind of inversion, for the wheels now run upon the ladies heads. As this
assertion may probably puzzle many readers, who pay no attention to the
rapid and whimsical revolutions of modern taste, it will be necessary
to inform them that instead of a cap, the present mode is for every female
of fashion to load her head <PB N="674" REF="249"/> with some kind of
carriage; whether they are made with broad wheels or not I cannot determine,
however, as they are undoubtedly excluded the Turnpike Act, it is by no means
material. Those heads which are not able to bear a coach and six (for
vehicles of this sort are very apt to crack the brain) so far act
consistently with prudence as to make use of a post chariot, or a
single horse chaise with a beau perching in the middle.</P>
<P>THE curiosity I had of knowing the purport of this
inven∣tion, and the general name of these machines led me to make enquiry
about them of a fashionable milliner at the court end of the town. She
obliged me with the sight of one of these equipages, designed for the
head of a lady of quality, which I surveyed with much admiration; and
pla∣cing it on the palm of my hand, could not help fancying myself like
<HI>Gulliver</HI> taking up the Empress of <HI>Lilliput</HI> in her
state-coach. The vehicle itself was constructed of gold threads, and was
drawn by six dapple greys of blown glass, with a coachman, postilion, and
gentleman within, of the same brittle manufacture. Upon further enquiry, the
milli∣ner told me with a smile, that it was difficult to give a reason for
inventions so full of whim, but that the name of this ornament (if it may be
called such) was a <HI>Capriole</HI> or <HI>Ca∣briole</HI>; which we may
trace from the same original with our <HI>English</HI> word
<HI>Caprice,</HI> both being derived from the <HI>French</HI> word
<HI>cabrer,</HI> which signifies <HI>to prance like an horse.</HI></P>
<P>IT is not to be doubted, but that this fashion took its
rise among the ladies from their fondness for equipage; and I dare say,
that every fair one, who carries a coach and six upon her head, would be glad
to be carried with equal splen∣dor <PB N="675" REF="250"/> in a coach of her
own. I would, therefore propose a scheme, which might render this
whimsical mode of some kind of service to both sexes; by which the
ladies may give a tacit hint of their inclinations without the least breach
of modesty, the men may prevent the danger and inconvenience attending the
present method of advertising for wives, and the whole course of a modern
courtship may be carried on by means of this new head-dress.</P>
<P>INSTEAD of a <HI>Capriole</HI> suppose this capital
decoration was called a <HI>Scutcheon</HI> of <HI>Pretence,</HI> which must
not here be un∣derstood as a Term of <HI>Heraldry,</HI> but as an invitation
to ma∣trimony. Thus if a lady presumes that she has a right either from her
wit, beauty, merit, or fortune, to pretend to a set of horses, let six
bright bays, blacks, or greys prance down one side of her head, and according
to the rank she insists upon, let a ducal, or an earl's coronet, or a
bloody hand be distinguished upon her <HI>Capriole.</HI> The females of
less ambition may likewise express their inclinations by a post∣chariot
and pair; and even those who, from a due consi∣deration of the low
condition of the funds, are so con∣descending as to stoop to a plain cit,
have nothing to do but to fix upon their heads a single horse chaise,
filled with a loving couple, sticking as close together as two dried figs.
As to those who have rashly vowed virginity, if their great proneness to
censure the rest of their sex, and the fretfulness of their aspect,
be not sufficient indications to keep the men at a distance, they may erect
upon their noddles a formal female seated in a Sulky, foolishly pleased
with having the whole vehicle to herself, and awkwardly exercising the
imaginary power of having the sole command of the reins.</P>
<P><PB N="676" REF="251"/>AS a farther means of facilitating this
new method of courtship, I must beg leave to propose, that every lady's
bosom should, instead of a pendent cross, which savours of popery, be
ornamented with a chain and locket, something like those bottle-tickets
which direct us to port, claret, or burgundy, upon which might be curiously
engraved the numbers two hundred, five hundred, or a thousand, accord∣ing to
the settlement expected. But to those female <HI>Quixotes</HI> who scorn
the <HI>Capriole,</HI> and erect <HI>Windmills</HI> upon their heads instead
of it, I shall offer a word of advice worthy their atten∣tion; which is, that
they would provide a pipe of commu∣nication, to be conveyed from these
machines to the brain, and constituted upon the model of the ingenious Dr.
<HI>Hale</HI>'s ventilators, that, whenever the sails of the Windmill are put
into motion by the external air, they may draw off all pernicious vapours which
may occasion a vertigo in the inside, as well as on the outside of their
heads.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>I am, Sir, your humble servant,
H.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>I AM much pleased with the proposal of my ingenious
correspondent, and think it particularly well adapted to the present
disposition of the ladies. A fondness for showy equipages is now become
one of their darling passions; and the splendor in which they are to be
maintained seems to be one of the chief considerations in modern matches.
If a fine lady can be carried to court in a chair richly ornamented, or roll to
the opera in a gilt chariot, she little considers with how disagreeable a
companion she goes through the journey of life: and a polite female would no
more fix her affections on a man, who drives but a beggarly pair, than she
could be content to be tumbled down to his country seat, like
<HI>Punch</HI>'s wife to <HI>Rumford,</HI> in a wheel-borrow.</P>
<P><PB N="677" REF="252"/>BUT as the ladies have strongly
manifested this passion for equipage, the gentlemen, I suppose out of
mere gal∣lantry, and in order to further the gratification of their de∣sires,
have taken great pains to convert themselves into coachmen, grooms, and
jockies. The flapped hat, the jemmy frock with plate buttons and a leathern
belt, and the pride which some young men of quality take in driving, are all
calculated the better to qualify them for being the ladies humble servants. I
am therefore for extending my corre∣spondent's scheme: and as the ladies
now adorn their heads with the sign of a coach and six, like the door of a
<HI>Meuse</HI> alehouse, I would have the gentlemen also bear these
emble∣matical vehicles; by which the other sex may, by a single glance at a
lover's head, see in what state they will be sup∣ported; as we know a
clergyman by his rose, or an officer by his cockade.</P>
<P>THE pretty fellows, who study dress, might shew a great
deal of invention in suiting their <HI>Caprioles</HI> to their
circum∣stances. Any nobleman or gentleman, who has the honour to be a
<HI>Knowing one,</HI> might shew his affection for the turf by carrying the
horse and jockey; another, who is an excellent driver, might bear his own
figure exalted in a <HI>Phaeton</HI>; and a third, who thinks of picking up a
partner for life, that can be pleased with a <HI>tête-a-tête</HI>
or sober picpuet party with her husband, may bear a
<HI>vis-à-vis.</HI> In a word, all the different proposals of various
suitors might be made by means of these ornaments, which might be worn over
the foreheads of the beaux, like the white horse in the grenadiers caps; and
the ladies might be as much smitten with a promising <HI>Capriole</HI> on
the head of a lover, as heretofore with an elegant perriwig.</P>
<P><PB N="678" REF="253"/>IF this mode should prevail, the
concluding a treaty of marriage between two persons of quality might be
considered in the same light, and expressed in the same terms as
<HI>making a match</HI> at <HI>New-market</HI>; and instead of the hackneyed
phrases at present used by our news-writers, we might perhaps see the
important articles in the public papers, concerning mar∣riages drawn up after
the following manner.</P>
<Q> 
<P>We hear that a match will be shortly made between the mourning
coach and six of a merchant's widow with a great jointure, and an hunter, in
fine order, belonging to a younger brother of a noble family.</P> 
<P>A running horse, highly valued for his blood, is expected to
start soon with a young filly from Yorkshire. Many thousand pounds are
depending on this match.</P> 
<P>A few days ago a young fellow from <HI>Ireland,</HI> mounted on
a single horse, attacked an heiress in her coach and six. The lady made
little or no resistance, and suffered herself to be taken out of the
coach, and carried off behind him.</P> 
<P>A gay coach and six, belonging to a young heir just of age,
came to town last week in great splendor, and was in∣tended to be matched
with an equipage of the same kind: but having unfortunately run against
<HI>Arthur</HI>'s chocolate-house, it broke down, and the owner was very much
hurt.</P> 
<P>We hear from <HI>Bath,</HI> that the post-chaise of a young
lady of great beauty lately made its appearance in the long room, and soon
after went off with the landau of a neighbouring country squire.</P> 
<P>We are also informed from the same place, that an
old∣fashioned two-wheel chaise with a single horse, contrived to hold
only one person, had drove about the walks for some time; but having
jostled against the Sulky of an old batchelor in his grand climacteric, it
was judged expedient to join them together; when they formed a most agreeable
<HI>vis-a-vis,</HI> for the mutual accommodation of both parties.</P> </Q>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">V</SEG>IRTU is almost the only instance, in which the appearance
of literary knowledge is affected in the present age; and our per∣sons of
rank acquire just enough scholarship to qualify themselves for
<HI>Connoisseurs.</HI> These sort of students become sufficiently
acquainted with the cus∣toms of the ancients, to learn the least
interesting par∣ticulars concerning them. They can distinguish a
<HI>Tiberius</HI> from a <HI>Trajan,</HI> know the <HI>Pantheon</HI> from the
<HI>Amphitheatre,</HI> and can explain the difference between the
<HI>praetexta</HI> and the <HI>tunica:</HI> which (only supposing the
present times to have elapsed some hundred years) is just as deep
knowledge as if <PB N="680" REF="255"/> some future antiquarian should
discover the difference between a <HI>Carolus</HI> and an <HI>Anna,</HI> or
St. <HI>Paul's</HI> church and <HI>Drury-Lane</HI> playhouse, or a
full-trimmed suit and a <HI>French</HI> frock.</P>
<P>BUT the full display of modern polite learning is exhi∣bited
in the decorations of parks, gardens, &amp;c. and centered in that important
monosyllable, Taste. Taste comprehends the whole circle of the polite
arts, and sheds its influence on every lawn, avenue, grass-plat, and
parterre. Taste has peopled the walks and gardens of the great with more
nu∣merous inhabitants than the ancient Satyrs, Fauns and Dry∣ads. While
infidelity has expunged the Christian Theology from our creed, Taste has
introduced the heathen Mytho∣logy into our gardens. If a pond is dug,
<HI>Neptune,</HI> at the command of Taste, emerges from the bason, and
presides in the middle; or if a vista is cut through a grove, it must be
terminated by a <HI>Flora</HI> or an <HI>Apollo.</HI> As the ancients held that
every spot of ground had its guardian Genius, and that woodland deities were
pegged in the knotty entrails of every tree, so in the gardens laid out by
modern Taste every walk is peopled with gods and goddesses, and every
corner of it has its tutelar-deity. Temples are erected to all the train of
gods and goddesses mentioned in <HI>Homer</HI> or <HI>Ovid,</HI> which
edifices as well as their several statues are adorned with <HI>Latin</HI>
or <HI>Greek</HI> inscriptions; while the learned owner won∣ders at his own
surprising stock of literature, which he sees drawn out at large before
him, like the whole knowledge of an apothecary inscribed upon his
gallipots.</P>
<P>THESE persons of Taste may be considered as a sort of
learned idolaters, since they may be almost said to adore these graven
images, and are quite enthusiastic in their veneration 
<PB N="681" REF="256"/> of them. The following letter may possibly give them
some offence; but as I have myself no extravagant fondness for a
<HI>Jupiter Tonans</HI> or a <HI>Belvidere Apollo,</HI> I heartily wish the
scheme proposed by my correspondent may take place, though it should
reduce the price of heathen godheads.</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>To Mr. TOWN.</HEAD>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AT a time when all wise heads are considering of ways and
means to raise taxes, that may prove the least oppressive to indigence,
and most effectually restrictive of luxury, permit me to propose (as a
supplement to the thoughts of one of your correspondents on this subject)
a national tax upon Gods.</P>
<P>IT is a strange but an undeniable truth, Mr. TOWN, that if
you and I were to travel through <HI>England,</HI> and to visit the citizen
in his country box, the nobleman at his seat, the esquire at the
hall-house, and even the divine at his parsonage, we should find the
gardens, avenues, and groves, belonging to each mansion, stuffed and
ornamented with Heathen Gods.</P>
<P>IN the present declining state of our established
religion, I almost tremble to consider what may be the consequences of
these ready-made deities. Far be it from me to suppose that the great and
the rich will worship any God what∣soever, but still I am induced to fear
that the poor and the vulgar, when they find all other worship ridiculed and
laid aside, may foolishly take to these molten images, and adore every
leaden godhead they can find. If a tax on wheels has put down some hundreds
of coaches, by a parity of reason, a tax upon gods may pull down an equal, if
not a greater <PB N="682" REF="257"/> number of statues. I would also offer
another proposal; which is this: That an oak be immediately planted,
where-ever a statue has been taken away, by which means those vast woods,
which of late years have been cut down in <HI>England,</HI> to supply the
immediate necessities of the illustrious <HI>Arthurites</HI> in St.
<HI>James</HI>'s-street, may be in some measure supplied to future
generations.</P>
<P>AMONG our present taxes some of them fall upon branches of
splendor not totally luxurious. Wheel carriages may be necessary: want of
health or lameness of limbs may require them: but what necessities can we
pretend for statues in our gardens, <HI>Penates</HI> in our libraries, and
<HI>Lares</HI> on every chimney-piece? I have remarked many wild whims of this
kind, that have appeared submissions, if not attachments, to idolatry. A
gentleman of my acquaintance has destroyed his chapel, merely because he
could not put up statues in it, and has filled his garden with every god,
that can be found in <HI>Spence</HI>'s <HI>Polymetis:</HI> Another of my
friends, after having placed a <HI>Belvidere Apollo</HI> very conspicuously
and na∣ked upon the top of a mount, has erected an Obelisk to the Sun: and
this expence he has not put himself to for the beauty of the Obelisk, for
it is not beautiful, nor again for the splendor of the planet, which is of
pewter double gilt, but only because being in possession of copies or
originals of every deity that <HI>Greece</HI> or <HI>Italy</HI> could boast,
he was resolved to have the God of <HI>Persia</HI> to compleat his
collection. A poll-tax therefore upon gods and goddesses, be their
repre∣sentation what it will, Suns, Dogs, Moons, or Monkies, is absolutely
necessary, and would infallibly bring in a large re∣venue to the
state.</P>
<P><PB N="683" REF="258"/>HAPPENING to be the other day at
<HI>Slaughter</HI>'s coffee∣house in St. <HI>Martin's Lane,</HI> I saw two
very fine statues of <HI>Fame</HI> and <HI>Fortune,</HI> brought out of Mr.
<HI>Roubilliac</HI>'s gate, and exposed to view before they were nailed up,
and carted. The boy of the house told us, they were to be placed upon the top
of Sir <HI>Thomas —</HI>'s chapel in <HI>Hampshire.</HI> 
<Q REND="inline">"Is it for such as these, observed a
sneering papist who stood near me, that crucifixes have been removed, and
that re∣verend saints and martyrs have been destroyed, and pounded into
dust? Is it for these, that St. <HI>Peter</HI> has been broken to pieces,
and St. <HI>Paul</HI> melted down into water pipes? Must <HI>Our Lady</HI>
make room for <HI>Proserpine?</HI> And the holy giant St.
<HI>Christopher</HI> fall a victim to the <HI>Farnesian Hercules?</HI> Will
you not agree with me, Sir, continued he, that as men are induced and almost
constrained to judge of others by their own manners and inclinations, we who
are sup∣posed to worship the images of christians, must naturally
conclude that the protestants of the Church of <HI>England</HI> worship the
images of heathens?"</Q> I confess I was at a loss how to answer the
acuteness of his questions; and must own that I cannot help thinking St.
<HI>Anthony</HI> preaching to the fishes, or St. <HI>Dunstan</HI> taking
the Devil by the nose, as pro∣per ornaments for a chapel, as any Pagan
deities whatever.</P>
<P>HITHERTO I have kept you entirely among the molten images
without doors, but were we to enter the several mansions whose avenues
and demesnes are adorned in the manner I describe, we should find every
chamber a pagod, filled with all the monstrous images that the idolatry of
<HI>India</HI> can produce. I will not presume to infer that the ladies
address <HI>Kitoos</HI> (prayers which the <HI>Japanese</HI> make use of
in <PB N="684" REF="259"/> time of public distress) to their
<HI>Ingens,</HI> but I am apt to sur∣mise, that in times of danger and
invasion, some of your fair readers would be more alarmed at the
<HI>French</HI> approach to their china than to their chapels, and would
sooner give up a favourite lap-dog, than a grotesque chimney-piece figure
of a <HI>Chinese</HI> saint with numberless heads and arms. I have not
yet digested my thoughts in what manner the fair sex ought to be taxed. It
is a tender point, and requires consi∣deration. At present, I am of
opinion, they ought to be spared, and the whole burthen entirely laid upon
those <HI>Bramins</HI> and <HI>Imams,</HI> whose idolatrous temples lie
publickly open to our streets.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="body of issue">
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> REMEMBER when I was very young, a re∣lation carried me to
visit a gentleman who had wrote some pieces that had been very well
received, and made me very happy by promising to introduce me to an Author.
As soon as I came, I surveyed his whole person from top to toe with the
strictest attention, sat open-mouthed to catch every syllable that he
uttered, and noticed his voice, manner, and every word and gesture with the
minutest observation. I could not help whispering to myself the whole
evening, 
<Q REND="inline">"I am in company with an Author,"</Q> and waited
with the most anxious impatience to hear him deliver something that 
<PB N="686" REF="261"/> might distinguish him from the rest of mankind.
The gentleman behaved with great chearfulness and politeness; but he did
not at all answer the idea which I had conceived of an Author, and I went
away exceedingly disappointed, because I could not find any striking
difference between him and the rest of my acquaintance.</P>
<P>THERE is no character in human life, which is the sub∣ject of
more frequent speculation among the vulgar, than an Author. Some look on him
with contempt, and others with admiration; but they all agree in believing him
to be something different from all other people: and it is re∣markable with
what greediness they attend to any little an∣ecdotes, which they can pick up
concerning his life and con∣versation. He is, indeed, a kind of an ideal
being, of which people conceive very different notions. By some he is
supposed never to stir out of a garret, to wear a rusty black coat,
dirty shirt, and darned stockings, and to want all the necessaries as
well as conveniences of life; while others regard him as a creature superior
to the rest of mortals, and endowed with something more than reason. One
part therefore is surprised to see him walk abroad, and appear as well
dressed as other people; and another is disappointed, when they find him
talk and act, and fill the offices of life, no better than any other common
man.</P>
<P>NOR is it less curious to consider the different ideas they
conceive of the manner in which the business of writing is executed. The
novice in literature, smit with the love of sacred song, but not yet dipt
in ink, supposes it all rapture and enthusiasm, and in imagination
sees the Author running wildly about his room, talking poetry to the chairs
and ta∣bles; <PB N="687" REF="262"/> while the mechanick considers him as
working at his trade, and thinks he can set down to write whenever he
pleases, as easily as the smith can labour at his forge, or a carpenter
plane a board. Indeed he regards the Author with some veneration as a
scholar; but writing appears to him a mighty easy business, and he
smiles whenever he hears any body mention the labour of it; nor has he the
least concep∣tion of the mind's being fatigued with thinking, and the fancy
harrassed with persuing a long train of ideas.</P>
<P>AS people are led frequently to judge of a man from his ordinary
conversation, so it is common for them to form an idea of the author's
disposition from the peculiar turn and colour of his writings: they expect
a gloom to be spread over the face of a mathematician; a controversial
writer must be given to wrangling and dispute; and they imagine that a
satirist must be made up of spleen, envy, and ill-nature. But this
criterion is by no means certain and determinate: I know an author of a
tragedy, who is the merriest man living; and one who has wrote a very witty
comedy, though he will sit an hour in company without speaking a word. Lord
<HI>Buckhurst</HI> is celebrated for being 
<Q REND="inline">"the best good man with the worst-natured
muse;"</Q> and Mr. <HI>Addison</HI> was remarkably shy and reserved in
conversation. I remember I once fell into company with a painter, a poet, a
divine, and a physician, who were no less famous for their wit and humour,
than for their excellence in their several professi∣ons. After the
usual common topics were discussed, the physician and the poet fell
into a dispute concerning pre∣destination, the divine smoked his pipe
quietly without put∣ting in a word, while the painter and myself formed a
privy <PB N="688" REF="263"/> council for the good of the nation. Thus were it
possible to conjure up the spirits of the most eminent wits in former
ages, and put them together, they would perhaps appear to be very dull company.
<HI>Virgil</HI> and <HI>Addison</HI> would probably sit staring at each
other without opening their mouths; <HI>Horace</HI> and <HI>Steele</HI> would
perhaps join in commendation of the liquor; and <HI>Swift</HI> would in all
likelihood divert him∣self with sucking his cheeks, drawing figures in the
wine spilt upon the table, or twirling the cork-screw round his finger.</P>
<P>THE strange prejudices which some persons conceive
against Authors, deter many a youth from drawing his pen in the service of
literature: or if he ventures to commit a favourite work to the press, he
steals to the printer's with as much caution and privacy, as he would
perhaps, on ano∣ther occasion, to a surgeon. He is afraid that he shall
in∣jure his character by being known to have written any thing, and that the
genteel part of his acquaintance will despise him as a low wretch, as
soon as they discover him to be an Author: as if merely the appearing in
print was a dis∣grace to a gentleman, and the <HI>imprimatur</HI> to his
works was no more than a stamp of shame and ignominy. These are the
terrors, which at first disturb the peace of almost every Au∣thor, and
have often put me in mind of the exclamation of that writer, who cried out, 
<Q REND="inline">"O, that mine enemy had writ∣ten a
book!"</Q></P>
<P>THESE fearful apprehensions are perhaps no unlucky drawback on
the vanity natural to all Authors, which un∣doubtedly they often conceal or
suppress, out of deference to the world: but if this false modesty is
too much che∣rished, <PB N="689" REF="264"/> it must of course damp all
genius, and discourage every literary undertaking. Why should it be
disgraceful to exert the noblest faculties given us by nature? and why
should any man blush at acquitting himself well in a work, which there is
scarce one in five hundred has a capacity to perform? Even supposing an
Author to support himself by the profit arising from his works, there is
nothing more dis∣honest, scandalous or mean in it, than an officer in the
army (the politest of all professions) living on his commission.
Sense and genius are as proper commodities to traffick in as courage, and an
Author is no more to be condemned as an hackney scribbler, though he writes
at the rate of so much <HI>per</HI> sheet, than a Colonel should be
despised as a mercenary and a bravo, for exposing himself to be
slashed, stuck, and shot at for so much <HI>per</HI> day. The truth
is, that Authors themselves often create the evils they complain of, and
bring a disgrace on the service of literature, by being ashamed to wear
the badge of it. <HI>Voltaire,</HI> in his <HI>letters on the</HI> English,
relates a remarkable instance of this kind of false pride in our own
<HI>Congreve. Voltaire,</HI> when he was in <HI>England,</HI> waited on
<HI>Congreve,</HI> and told him that he was glad of an opportunity of paying
his respects to a writer so much cele∣brated for his wit and humour.
<HI>Congreve</HI> received him po∣litely enough, but told him that he should
be glad to see him as a common gentleman, but would not be considered or
conversed with as an Author. The <HI>French</HI> writer was a good deal
surprised at such a ridiculous piece of delicacy, and could not help
telling him, that he thought this nicety some∣thing extraordinary, for that
if he had been no more than a common gentleman, he should never have had any
desire of seeing him.</P>
<P>I HAVE often pleased myself with reflecting on the
differ∣ent opinions, which my readers must have formed of me, since my
first appearance as an Author. As poverty is one of the general
characteristics of our brotherhood, those who indulge themselves in a
contempt of writers, have, I doubt <PB N="690" REF="265"/> not, often painted me
to their own imagination in a very grotesque taste. Their ideal caricatures
have perhaps often re∣presented me lodged at least three stories from the
ground, composing dissertations on the modern taste in architecture: at
another time I may have been delineated sitting in a tat∣tered night-gown and
the breeches of a heathen philosopher, writing satires on the present
modes in dress: and sometimes perhaps they have figured me half starved
for want of a hearty meal, penning invectives against luxury and
de∣bauchery.</P>
<P>BUT while these have reduced me to this low condition, and 
<Q REND="inline">"steeped me in poverty to the very lips,"</Q>
I flatter my∣self that some few have bestowed on me an extraordinary
share of virtue and understanding. After so many grave les∣sons
against the vices and luxury of the present age, they will naturally
suppose, that I never risked a farthing at the gaming-table, never kept a
mistress, would decline an invitation to a turtle-feast, and rather than
be provoked to fight a duel, would take a kick on the breech, or tweak by the
nose, with all the calmness and resignation imaginable. As to my wit and
humour, I should blush to set down the many com∣pliments I have had from
several unknown correspon∣dents on that head: and I once received a note
from a very honest gentleman, who desired to spend an evening with me,

Mr. TOWN.</P>
<P>THESE various opinions of me as an Author, I shall never
labour to reconcile, but shall be equally contented with in∣structing or
amusing the gentle reader, whether he considers my papers as favours
showered down upon him from a book∣seller's garret in <HI>Grub Street,</HI>
or issuing from my own apart∣ment. However this may be, I shall never
think it a disgrace to have written, or be ashamed to be considered as an
Au∣thor; and if ever Mr. <HI>Voltaire</HI> should think proper to visit
<HI>England</HI> again, I shall be very glad of a literary chat with him, and
will give him a very gracious reception.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>April</HI> 5, 1756.</DATE></DATELINE>

<SALUTE>SIR!</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">N</SEG>O man is a sincerer friend to innocent plea∣santry, or
more desirous of promoting it, than myself. Raillery of every kind,
pro∣vided it be confined within due bounds, is in my opinion an excellent
ingredient in conversation; and I am never displeased if I can contribute
to the harmless mirth of the company, by being myself the subject of it;
but in good truth, I have neither a fortune, a constitution, nor a temper
that will enable me to chuckle and skake my sides, while I suffer more
from the festivity of my friends, than the spleen or malice of my enemies
could possibly inflict upon me: nor do I see any reason why 
<PB N="692" REF="267"/> I should so far move the mirthful indignation of the
ladies, as to be teized and worried to death in mere sport, for no earthly
reason, but that I am what the world calls, an Old Bachelor.</P>
<P>THE female part of my acquaintance entertain an odd opinion,
that a Bachelor is not in fact a rational creature, at least that he has not
the sense of feeling in common with the rest of mankind; that a Bachelor
may be beat like a stock-fish, that you may thrust pins into his legs,
and wring him by the nose; in short that you cannot take too many liberties
with a Bachelor. I am at a loss to conceive on what foundation these
romping philosophers have grounded their hypothesis, though at the same
time I am a melancholy proof of it's existence, as well as of it's
absurdity.</P>
<P>A FRIEND of mine whom I frequently visit, has a wife and
three daughters, the youngest of which has persecuted me these ten years.
These ingenious young ladies have not only found out the sole end and
purpose of my being them∣selves, but have likewise communicated their
discovery to all the girls in the neighbourhood. So that if they happen at
any time to be apprized of my coming (which I take all possible care to
prevent) they immediately dispatch half a dozen cards to their faithful
allies, to beg the favour of their company to drink coffee, and <HI>help
teaze</HI> Mr. <HI>Ironside.</HI> Upon these occasions, my entry into the
room is sometimes obstructed by a cord fastened across the bottom of
the door∣case, which as I am a little near-sighted, I seldom discover
till it has brought me upon my knees before them. While I am employed in
brushing the dust from my black rollers, or chasing my broken shins, my
wig is suddenly conveyed <PB N="693" REF="268"/> away, and either stuffed
behind the looking-glass, or tossed from one to the other so
dextrously and with such velocity, that after many a fruitless attempt to
recover it, I am obliged to sit down bare-headed, to the great diversion of
the spec∣tators. The last time I found myself in these distressful
circumstances, the eldest girl, a sprightly mischievous jade, stepped
briskly up to me, and promised to restore my wig, if I would play her a
tune on a small flute she held in her hand. I instantly applied it to my
lips, and blowing lustily into it, to my inconceiveable surprise, was
immediately choked and blinded with a cloud of soot that issued from
every hole in the instrument. The younger part of the company declared I had
not executed the conditions, and refused to surrender my wig; but the
father who had a rough kind of facetiousness about him, insisted on
it's being delivered up, and protested that he never knew the <HI>Black
Joke</HI> better performed in his life.</P>
<P>I AM naturally a quiet inoffensive animal, and not easily
ruf∣fled, yet I shall never submit to these indignities with patience,
'till I am satisfied I deserve them. Even the old maids of my acquaintance,
who one would think might have a fellow-feeling for a brother in distress,
conspire with their nieces to harrass and torment me. And it is not many
nights since Miss <HI>Diana Grizzle</HI> utterly spoiled the only
superfine suit I have in the world, by pinning the skirts of it together
with a red-hot poker. I own my resentment of this injury was so strong,
that I determined to punish it by kissing the offender, which in cool
blood I should never have attempted. The satisfac∣tion however which I
obtained by this imprudent revenge, was much like what a man of honour feels on
finding him∣self <PB N="694" REF="269"/> run through the body by the
scoundrel who had offended him. My upper lip was transfixed with a large
corkin pin, which in the scuffle she had conveyed into her mouth, and I
doubt not that I shall carry the <HI>memorem labris natam</HI> from an old
maid to the grave with me.</P>
<P>THESE misfortunes, or others of the same kind, I en∣counter
daily; but at these seasons of the year which give a sanction to this
kind of practical wit, and when every man thinks he has a right to entertain
himself at his friend's ex∣pence, I live in hourly apprehensions of more
mortifying adventures. No miserable dunghill-cock, devoted a victim to the
wanton cruelty of the mob, would be more terrified at the approach of a
<HI>Shrove-Tuesday,</HI> were he endued with human reason and forecast,
than I am at the approach of a merry <HI>Christmas</HI> or the First of
<HI>April.</HI> No longer ago than last <HI>Thursday,</HI> which was the
latter of these festivals, I was pestered with mortifying presents from
the ladies; obliged to pay the carriage of half a dozen oyster-barrels
stuffed with brick-bats, and ten pacquets by the post containing nothing
but old news-papers. But what vexed me the most was the being sent fifty
miles out of town on that day by a counter∣feit express from a dying
relation.</P>
<P>I COULD not help reflecting with a sigh, on the
resem∣blance between the imaginary grievance of poor <HI>Tom</HI> in the
tragedy of <HI>Lear,</HI> and those which I really experienced. I, like him,
was led through ford and whirlpool, o'er bog and quagmire; and though knives
were not laid under my pil∣low, minced horse-hair was strewed upon my
sheets; like him I was made to ride on a hard trotting horse, through the
most dangerous ways, and found at the end of my jour∣ney, that I had only
been coursing my own shadow.</P>
<P><PB N="695" REF="270"/>AS much a sufferer as I am by the
behaviour of the women in general, I must not forget to remark, that the
pertness and sauciness of an old maid, is particularly offen∣sive to
me. I cannot help thinking that the virginity of these ancient misses, is
at least as ridiculous as my own celibacy. If I am to be condemned for having
never made an offer, they are as much to blame for having never accepted one.
If I am to be derided for having never married, who never attempted to make a
conquest; they are more properly the objects of derision, who are still
unmarried after having made so many. Numberless are the proposals they
have rejected according to their own account; and they are eter∣nally
boasting of the havock they have formerly made among the knights, baronets,
and squires, at <HI>Bath, Tun∣bridge</HI> and <HI>Epsom</HI>; while a
tattered madrigal perhaps, a snip of hair, or the portrait of a
cherry-cheeked gentleman in a milk-white periwig, are the only remaining proofs
of those beauties which are now withered like the short-lived rose, and
have only left the virgin thorn remaining.</P>
<P>BELIEVE me, Mr. TOWN, I am almost afraid to trust you with
the publication of this epistle; the ladies whom I last mentioned will be
so exasperated on reading it, that I must expect no quarter at their
hands for the future, since they are generally as little inclined to
forgiveness in their old age, as they were to pity and compassion in
their youth. One expedient however is left me, and which, if put in execution,
will effectually screen me from their resentment.</P>
<P>I SHALL be happy therefore, if by your means I may be
permitted to inform the ladies, that as fusty an animal as they think me, it
is not impossible but by a little gentler <PB N="696" REF="271"/> treatment
than I have hitherto met with, I may be huma∣nized into a husband. As an
inducement to them to relieve me from my present uneasy circumstances,
you may assure them I am rendered so exceeding tractable by the very
se∣vere discipline I have undergone, that they may mould and fashion me
to their minds with ease; and consequently that by marrying me, a woman
will save herself all that trouble which a wife of any spirit is obliged
to take with an unruly husband, who is absurd enough to expect from her a
strict performance of the marriage vow, even in the very minute article of
obedience: that so far from contradicting a lady, I shall be mighty well
satisfied if she contents herself with contradicting me: that if I happen
at any time inadvertently to thwart her inclinations, I shall think myself
rightly served if she boxes my ears, spits in my face, or treads upon my
corns. That if I approach her lips when she is not in a kissing humour, I
shall expect she will bite me by the nose; or if I take her by the hand
at an improper season, that she will instantly begin to pinch,
scratch, and claw, and apply her fingers to those purposes which they
were certainly in∣tended by nature to fulfil. Add to these accomplishments,
so requisite to make the married state happy, that I am not much turned
of fifty, can tie on my cravat, fasten a button, or mend a hole in my
stocking without any assistance.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HOSE parents, who are unable to give their sons an estate,
regard the educating them to one of the three great professions of Law,
Physic, and Divinity, as putting them in the high road to acquire one. Hence
it happens, that nineteen parts out of twenty of our young men are brought up
with a view to <HI>Lambeth,</HI> the <HI>Seals,</HI> or <HI>Warwick-Lane.</HI>
But alas! their hopes and ex∣pectations of rising by their professions
are often frustrated, and the surprizing numbers engaged in running the
same race necessarily jostle one another. For though the courts of
justice are tolerably supplied with matters of litigation; 
<PB N="698" REF="273"/> though there are many invalids and valetudinarians; and
though great part of <HI>England</HI> is laid out into church pre∣ferments; yet
there is not in all the kingdom sufficient matter for legal contention to
employ a tenth part of those who have been trained to engross deeds in
their chambers, or to harangue at the bar: the number of patients bears no
proportion to the swarms of the Faculty, nor would it, though a
consultation were to sit on every sick man, like carrion-flies upon a
carcase: and the prodigious number of reverend Divines infinitely exceeds
that of those bishopricks, deaneries, prebends, rectories, vicarages,
&amp;c. which, when they are ordained, they conceive it to be part of their
holy office to fill. From these frequent failures in each of the
professions, the younger sons of great men often wish they had been
permitted to disgrace the family by some mer∣cantile, or more plebeian
occupation; while the son of the mechanic curses the pride of his father,
who instead of securing him a livelihood in his own business, has
con∣demned him to starve in pudding-sleeves, that he might do honour to his
relations by being a gentleman.</P>
<P>THE Three Professions being thus crouded with more
candidates for business and preferment, than can possibly be employed
or promoted, has occasioned several irregula∣rities in the conduct of the
followers of each of them. The utter impossibility of supporting
themselves in the usual method of practising Law, Physic, or Divinity,
without clients, patients, or parishioners, has induced the labourers in each
of those vocations to seek out new veins and branches. The young Solicitor,
who finds he has nothing to do, now he is out of his clerkship, offers his
assistance, in the transaction of all law affairs, by the public
papers, and <PB N="699" REF="274"/> like the advertising taylors promises to
work cheaper than any of his brethren: while the young Barrister, after
having exhibited his tye-wig in <HI>Westminster-Hall,</HI> during several
terms, to no purpose, is obliged to forego the hope of ri∣valling
<HI>Murray</HI> and <HI>Coke,</HI> and content himself with being the oracle
of the courts of <HI>Jamaica.</HI> The graduate in me∣dicine, finding himself
unsolicited for prescription or advice, and likely to starve by
practising Physic <HI>secundùm artem,</HI> flies in the face of
the college, and professes to cure all dis∣eases by <HI>nostrums</HI>
unmentioned in the dispensatory. He com∣mences a thriving quack, and soon
makes his way through the important medical degrees of walking on foot, riding
on horseback, dispensing his drugs from an one-horse-chaise, and
lastly lolling in a chariot. The Divine, without living, cure, or
lectureship, may perhaps incur transportation for illegal marriages, set
up a theatrical-oratorical-<HI>Billingsgate</HI>-chapel under the shelter
of the toleration-act and the but∣chers of <HI>Clare-Market,</HI> or kindle the
<HI>inward light</HI> in the bosoms of the Saints of <HI>Moor-Fields,</HI>
and the <HI>Magdalens</HI> of <HI>Broad</HI> St. <HI>Giles</HI>'s.</P>
<P>BUT notwithstanding these shoots ingrafted, as it were,
into the main body of the professions, it is still impossible for the
vast multitude of Divines, Lawyers, and Physicians to maintain themselves
at any rate within the pale of their respective employments. They have often
been compelled, at least to call in adventitious ones, and have sometimes
to∣tally abandoned their original undertakings. They have frequently made
mutual transitions into the occupations of each other, or have perhaps
embraced other employments; which, though distinct from all three, and not
usually dig∣nified with the title of Professions, may fairly be
considered <PB N="700" REF="275"/> in that light: since they are the sole
means of support to many thousands, who toiled in vain for a
subsistance in the three Capital Ones. On these Professions, and
their various followers, I shall here make some observations.</P>
<P>THE first of these Professions is an Author. The mart of
literature is indeed one of the chief resorts of unbeneficed Divines, and
Lawyers and Physicians without practice. There are at present in the world
of Authors, Doctors of Physic who (to use the phrase of one of them) have
no great fatigue from the business of their profession: many Clergymen,
whose sermons are the most inconsiderable part of their compositions:
and several Gentlemen of the Inns of Court who, instead of driving the
quill over skins of parch∣ment, lead it through all the mazes of modern
novels, cri∣tiques, and pamphlets. Many also have embraced this
Pro∣fession, who were never bred to any other: and I might also mention
the many bankrupt tradesmen and broken artificers, who daily enter into this
new way of business, if by persuing it in the same mechanical manner as
their former occupati∣ons, they might not rather be regarded as following a
trade than a Profession.</P>
<P>THE second of these Professions is a Player. The
inge∣nious gentlemen, who assume the persons of the Drama, are composed
of as great a variety of characters as those they represent. The history
of the stage might afford many in∣stances of those who <HI>in the trade
of</HI> death <HI>might have slain men,</HI> who have condescended to deal
counterfeit slaughter from their right hands, and administer harmless
phials and bowls of poison. We might read also of persons whose fists
were intended to beat the 
<Q REND="inline">"drum ecclesiastic,"</Q> who have 
<PB N="701" REF="276"/> themselves become theatrical voluntiers. In regard to
the Law, many who were originally designed to manifest their talents for
elocution in <HI>Westminster-Hall,</HI> have displayed them in
<HI>Drury-Lane</HI>; and it may be added on theatrical authority, that 
<Q> 
<L>Not even <HI>Attorneys</HI> have this rage withstood,</L> 
<L>But chang'd their pens for truncheons, ink for blood,</L> 
<L>And, strange reverse!—died for their country's
good.</L></Q> I will not so far affront those gentlemen, who were at any
time engaged in the study of the three honourable profes∣sions of Law,
Physic, and Divinity, as to suppose that any of them, have ever taken up
the more fashionable employment of a Pimp. Yet it is certain, that this is a
very common and lucrative Profession, and that very many provide
themselves with the necessaries of life, by administering to the
pleasures of others. A convenient cousin, sister, or wife, has
some∣times proved the chief means of making a fortune; and the tongue of
slander has often ventured to affirm, that the price of procuration has been
paid with a place or a bishoprick.</P>
<P>THE most advantageous and genteel of all Professions is
Gaming. Whoever will make this science his study will find it the
readiest way to riches, and most certain passport to the best
company: for the polite world will always admit any one to their society, who
will condescend to win their money. The followers of this Profession are
very nume∣rous; which is indeed no wonder, when we reflect on the numbers it
supports in ease and affluence, at no greater pains than packing the cards
or cogging the dice, and no more risk than being sometimes tweaked by the
nose, or kicked out of company: besides which, this Profession daily
re∣ceives <PB N="702" REF="277"/> new lustre from the many persons of
quality that follow it, and croud into it with as much eagerness, as into the
army. Among Gamesters may also be found Lawyers, who get more by being
masters of all the Cases in <HI>Hoyle,</HI> than by their knowledge of
those, recorded in the report∣books; Physicians, the chief object of
whose attention is the circulation of the E. O. table; and Divines, who, we
may suppose, were hinted at by a famous wit in a certain assembly, when
among the other benefits resulting from a double tax upon dice, he thought
fit to enumerate, that it might possibly prevent the Clergy from playing at
back-gammon.</P>
<P>BUT the more danger the more honour: and therefore no
Profession is more honourable than that of a Highwayman. Who the followers
of this Profession are, and with what suc∣cess they practise it, I
will not pretend to relate; as the memoirs of several of them have been
already penned by the Ordinary of <HI>Newgate,</HI> and as it is to be hoped
that the lives of all the present practitioners will be written here∣after by
that faithful historian. I shall therefore only say, that the present
spirit of dissoluteness and freethinking must unavoidably bring this
honourable Profession more and more into vogue, and that every Sessions
may soon be expected to afford an instance of a
<HI>Gentleman</HI>-Highwayman.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="body of issue">
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> Have often amused myself with consi∣dering the mean and
ridiculous shifts, to which the extravagant are sometimes re∣duced. When
the certain supplies of a regular income are exhausted, they are obliged to
cast about for ready cash, and set the invention to work in order to
devise the means of repairing their finances. Such attempts to enlarge their
revenue have frequently driven those, whose great souls would not be
curbed by the straitness of their circumstances, into very uncommon
undertakings: they have sent lords to <HI>Arthur</HI>'s, and ladies to
assemblies, or sometimes worse places. We may safely conclude, that
whoever breaks through all oeconomy, will soon discard honesty; though
perhaps it might be deemed <HI>Scandalum Magnatum</HI> to aver, that prodigal
men of quality have often sold their <PB N="704" REF="279"/> country to redeem
their estates, and that extravagant ladies have been known to make up the
deficiencies of their pin-money by pilfering and larceny.</P>
<P>But one of the first and chief resources of extravagance,
both in high and low life, is the Pawnbroker's. I never pass by one of
these shops without considering them as the repositories of half the
jewels, plate, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in town. It is true, indeed, that the honest
and industrious are sometimes forced to supply their necessities by
this method: but if we were to enquire, to whom the several articles in
these miscellaneous warehouses belong, we should find the greatest
part of them to be the pro∣perty of the idle and infamous among the vulgar, or
the prodigal and luxurious among the great: and if, in imi∣tation of the
antients, who placed the Temple of Honour behind the Temple of Virtue,
propriety should be at∣tempted in the situation of Pawnbrokers' shops,
they would be placed contiguous to a gin-shop, as in the in∣genious print of
<HI>Hogarth,</HI> or behind a tavern, gaming-house, or bagnio.</P>
<P>Going home late last Saturday night, I was witness to a
curious dialogue at the door of one of these houses. An honest journeyman
carpenter, whose wife, it seems, had pawned his best cloaths, having
just received his week's pay, was come to redeem them, that he might appear
as fine as he usually did on Sunday: but it being past twelve o'clock, the
man of the house, who kept up the conversation by means of a little grate
in the door, re∣fused to deliver them; though the poor carpenter begged hard
for his holiday cloaths, as the morrow was <HI>Easter</HI> Sunday. This
accident led me to reflect on the various persons in town, who carry on this
kind of commerce with the Pawnbrokers, and gave occasion to the fol∣lowing
Dream.</P>
<P>I was scarce asleep, before I found myself at the entrance
of a blind alley, which was terminated by a little hatch; where I saw a
vast concourse of people, of different ages, sex, and condition, going in
and coming out. Some of these, I observed, as they went up, very 
<PB N="705" REF="280"/> richly drest; and others were adorned with jewels and
costly trinkets: but I could not help remarking, that at their return they
were all divested of their finery; and several had even their gowns and
coats stript off their backs. A lady, who strutted up in a rich brocaded
suit, sneaked back again in an ordinary stuff night-gown; a second
retreated with the loss of a diamond solitaire and pearl necklace; and a
third, who had bundled up her whole stock of linen, scarce escaped with
what she had upon her back. I observed several gentlemen, who brought
their sideboards of plate, to be melted down, as it were, into current
specie: many had their pockets dis∣burthened of their watches; and some,
even among the military gentlemen, were obliged to deliver up their swords.
Others of the company marched up, heavy laden with pictures, household goods,
and domestic utensils: one carried a spit; another brandished a
gridiron; a third flourished a frying-pan; while a fourth brought to my
remembrance the old sign of the Dog's Head in the Porridge-pot. I saw
several trot up merrily with their chairs, tables, and other furniture: but I
could not help pitying one poor creature among the rest, who, after having
stript his whole house, even to his feather-bed, stalked along like a
Lock-Patient, wrapt up in the blankets, while his wife accompanied him, doing
pe∣nance in the sheets.</P>
<P>As I was naturally curious to see the inside of the
re∣ceptacle, where all these various spoils were deposited, I stept up
to the hatch; and meeting a grave old gentleman at the threshold, I desired
him to inform me what place it was, and what business was transacted
there. He very courteously took me by the hand, and, leading me through a
dark passage, brought me into a spacious hall, which he told me was the
Temple of Usury, and that he himself was the chief priest of it. One part
of this building was hung round with all kinds of apparel, like the
sale-shops in <HI>Monmouth Street</HI>; another was strew'd with a
variety of goods, and resembled the brokers' shops in <HI>Harp Alley</HI>;
and another part was furnished with such an immense quantity of jewels
and rich plate, that I should rather have fancied myself in the Church of
the <PB N="706" REF="281"/> Lady of <HI>Loretto.</HI> All these, my guide
informed me, were the offerings of that croud, which I had seen re∣sorting
to this Temple. The Churches in Roman-Catholic countries have commonly a
cross fixed upon them; the <HI>Chinese</HI> erect dragons and hang bells
about their Pagods; and the <HI>Turkish</HI> Mosques have their peculiar
hieroglyphics: but I could not help taking particular notice, that this Temple
of Usury had its vestibule adorned with three wooden balls painted blue;
the mystery of which, I was told, was as dark and unfathomable as the
<HI>Pythagorean</HI> number, or the secret doctrines of
<HI>Trismegist.</HI></P>
<P>When I had in some measure satisfied my curiosity in
taking a general survey of the Temple, my instructor led me to an interior
corner of it, where the most splendid offerings were spread upon a large
altar. This bauble, said he, shewing me an elegant sprig of diamonds, is
an aigret, sent in last week by a lady of quality, who has ever since
kept home with her head muffled up in a double clout for a pretended fit of the
tooth-ache. She has at different times made an offering of all her jewels: and
besides these, her whole wardrobe was very lately lodged here, which threw
her into an hysteric fever, and con∣fined her to her bed-gown for upwards of
a month. Those ear-rings and other jewels are the <HI>parapher∣nalia</HI> of
a young bride; who was so constant a votary to this place, that, when
nothing else remained for an offering, she even brought in her
wedding-ring. You may be surprised, perhaps, to behold such a variety of
necklaces, girdle-buckles, solitaires, and other female ornaments, as are
here collected: but it is observable, that their devotions in the Temple of
Usury have been chiefly encouraged and kept alive by their assisting at
the midnight orgies of Avarice.</P>
<P>Nor are the gentlemen, continued he, less encouragers of our
rites. That gold watch laid snug, for a consi∣derable time, in the fob of a
young man of quality; but it was one night jerked out by a single throw of
the dice at a gaming-table, and made its way into the pocket of a stranger,
who placed it here, to keep company with several others, which have been
brought hither on a <PB N="707" REF="282"/> similar occasion. Those
brilliant buckles once glittered on the shoes of a very pretty fellow, who
set out last winter on his travels into foreign parts, but never got
further than <HI>Boulogne:</HI> and that sword with the rich fillagree hilt,
and elegantly-fancied sword-knot with gold tassels, once dangled at the
side of a spirited Buck, who left it here two years ago, when he went off
in a great hurry to take possession of a large estate in his native
country, <HI>Ireland,</HI> whence he is not yet returned. You may see many
others of these instruments of death, which rust peacefully in their
scabbards, as being of no use whatever to their owners: that, which
commonly hangs upon the vacant peg there, belongs, you must know, to a noble
captain: it is called upon duty once a month, and is at this instant mounting
guard at St. <HI>James</HI>'s.</P>
<P>Not far from these rich ornaments hung several em∣broidered
coats, laced waistcoats, <HI>Point d'Espagne</HI> hats, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
This suit, said my venerable instructor, pointing to one richly
embroidered, was made up for a noble lord on the last Birth-day, and was
conveyed hither the very next morning after it had appeared at court. That
jemmy waistcoat with the gold-worked button-holes, on the next peg, was the
property of a smart templar, who, having spent a night out of his chambers,
sent his waist∣coat hither in the morning, as a penitential offering, by
his landlady. As to that heap of camblet gowns, checked aprons, and coloured
handkerchiefs, which you see strung together a little further off, they are
oblations made here by a sect of maudlin votaries, who resort to this
Temple to pay their devotions to a Goddess, whom they have christened Madam
<HI>Gin,</HI> but whom they sometimes honour with the more proper appellation
of <HI>Strip me Naked.</HI></P>
<P>While my conductor was thus relating the history of the
various offerings, and the persons who had made them, he was suddenly
called aside to a dark closet, se∣veral of which were erected near the
entrance, and ap∣peared not unlike the confessionals of the
<HI>Romish</HI> priests. These little boxes, I found, were appointed to
receive the votaries, who came to pay their devotions, and make their
offerings: but the necessary rites and ceremonies <PB N="708" REF="283"/>
were commonly solemnized with as much caution and privacy, as the mysteries
of the <HI>Bona Dea</HI> among the <HI>Romans.</HI> At present, however,
there was a greater noise and hubbub than usual. A person of the first
rank in the kingdom, who had made some very considerable oblations of gold
and silver plate, was now about to celebrate a feast in honour of
<HI>Bacchus,</HI> in which these rich utensils would be requisite, on
which occasion he prayed to have the use of them. The chief priest, after
having received the customary fee, granted a dispen∣sation for this
purpose, and loaded the messengers with a number of wrought ewers,
vases, and chargers, at the same time commissioning two or three of the
inferior officials of the Temple to attend the celebration of the feast, and
to take care that the plate was duly returned, and safely lodged again in the
Temple.</P>
<P>These matters were scarce adjusted, before an unex∣pected
incident filled the whole Temple with confusion and disturbance. A rude
tribe of officers broke in upon us, put a stop to the rites, and seized the
chief priest himself, charging him with having prophaned the place by a
crime almost as infamous as sacrilege. He was accused of having
encouraged robbers to strip the citizens of their most valuable effects,
and for a small reward to deposit them as offerings. The clamour on this
occasion was very great, and at last one of the officers, methought,
seized me, as a party concerned; when endeavouring to clear myself, and
struggling to get out of his clutches, I awoke.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HERE is no race of people, that has been more conspicuous in
almost every relation of life, than the illustrious fa∣mily of NONSENSE. In
every age of the world they have shone forth with uncommon lustre, and have
made a wonderful progress in all the Arts and Sciences. They have at
different seasons delivered speeches from the throne, harangued at the
bar, debated in parlia∣ment, and gone amazing lengths in philosophical
enqui∣ries and metaphysical disquisitions. In a word, the whole history
of the world, moral and political, is but a <HI>Cyclo∣paedia of</HI> NONSENSE.
For which reason, considering the dignity and importance of the family, and
the infinite service it has been of to me and many of my cotemporaries, 
<PB N="710" REF="285"/> I have resolved to oblige the public with a kind of
abstract of the History of NONSENSE.</P>
<P>NONSENSE was the daughter of IGNORANCE, begot on FALSEHOOD many
ages ago in a dark cavern in BOEOTIA. As she grew up, she inherited all the
qualities of her parents: she discovered too warm a genius to re∣quire
being sent to school; but while other dull brats were poring over an
horn-book, she amused herself with spreading fantastical lies, taught
her by her mamma, and which have in later ages been familiarly known to us
under the names of <HI>Sham, Banter,</HI> and <HI>Humbug.</HI> When she grew
up, she received the addresses, and soon became the wife, of IMPUDENCE.
Who he was, or of what profession, is uncertain: Some say he was the
son of IGNORANCE by another <HI>venter,</HI> and was suffered to become the
husband of NONSENSE in those dark ages of the world, as the
<HI>Ptolemies</HI> of <HI>Aegypt</HI> married their own sisters. Some
record, that he was in the army; others, that he was an interpreter of the
laws; and others, a divine. However this was, NONSENSE and IM∣PUDENCE were
soon inseparably united to each other, and became the founders of a more
noble and nume∣rous family, than any yet preserved on any tree of descent
whatsoever; of which ingenious device they were said to have been the
first inventors.</P>
<P>It is my chief intent at present to record the great exploits
of that branch of the family, who have made themselves remarkable in
<HI>England</HI>; though they began to signalize themselves very early, and
are still very flourishing in most parts of the world. Many of them were
<HI>Aegyptian</HI> Priests four thousand years ago, and told the people,
that it was religion to wor∣ship dogs, monkeys, and green leeks: and their
descen∣dants prevailed on the <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Romans</HI> to build
tem∣ples in honour of supposed deities, who were, in their 
<PB N="711" REF="286"/> own estimation of them, whores and whore-mongers,
pickpockets and drunkards. Others rose up some ages after in
<HI>Turky,</HI> and persuaded the people to embrace the doctrine of
bloodshed and the sword, <HI>in the name of the most merciful God:</HI>
and others have manifested their lineal descent from NONSENSE and
IMPU∣DENCE, by affirming that there is no God at all. There were also among
them many shrewd philosophers; some of whom, though they were racked with
a fit of the stone, or laid up with a gouty toe, declared that they felt not
the least degree of pain; and others would not trust their own eyes, but
when they saw an horse or a dog, could not tell whether it was not a chair
or a table, and even made a doubt of their own existence.</P>
<P>We have no certain account of the progress of NON∣SENSE here
in <HI>England,</HI> till after the Reformation. All we hear of her and her
progeny before that period of time is, that they led a lazy life among the
monks in cloysters and convents, dreaming over old legends of saints,
drawing up breviaries and mass-books, and string∣ing together some
barbarous <HI>Latin</HI> verses in rhyme. In the days of Queen
<HI>Elizabeth,</HI> so little encouragement was given to her family, that it
seemed to have been almost extinct: but in the succeeding reign it
flourished again, and filled the most considerable offices in the nation.
NONSENSE became a great favourite at court, where she was highly caressed
on account of her wit, which consisted in puns and quibbles; and the bonny
monarch himself was thought to take a more than or∣dinary delight in her
conversation. At this time, many of her progeny took orders, and got
themselves preferred to the best livings, by turning the Evangelists into
pun∣sters, and making St. <HI>Paul</HI> quibble from the pulpit. Among the
rest, there was a bishop, a favourite son of NONSENSE, of whom it is
particularly recorded, that he used to tickle his courtly audience, by
telling them that <PB N="712" REF="287"/> <HI>matrimony</HI> was become a
<HI>matter of money,</HI> with many other right reverend jests recorded in
<HI>Joe Miller.</HI> Several bro∣thers of this family were likewise bred to
the bar, and very gravely harangued against old women sucked by devils in
the shape of ram-cats, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> As an instance of their profound
wisdom and sagacity, I need only men∣tion that just and truly pious act
of parliament made against the crying sin of witchcraft. 
<Q REND="inline"><BIBL>1 <HI>Jac.</HI> I. chap. 12.</BIBL>
<HI>Such as shall use invocation or conjuration of any evil spirit, or
shall consult, covenant with, entertain, employ, feed or reward any evil
spirit to any intent, or take up any dead person, or part thereof, to be
used in witchcraft, or have used any of the said arts, whereby any
person shall be killed, consumed, or lamed in his or her body, they,
together with their ac∣cessories before the fact, shall suffer as
felons, without benefit of clergy.</HI></Q></P>
<P>In the troublesome times of King <HI>Charles</HI> the first,
NONSENSE and her family sided with the Parliament. These set up new
sects in religion: some of them cropt their hair short, and called
themselves the <HI>enlightened</HI>; some fell into trances, and pretended
to see holy visions; while others got into tubs, and held forth, with many
whinings, and groans, and snuffling through the nose. In the merry days of
King <HI>Charles</HI> the second, NONSENSE assumed a more gay and
libertine air; and her progeny, from fana∣tics, became downright infidels.
Several courtiers of the family wrote lewd plays, as well as luscious
love-songs, and other loose verses, which were collected together, and
greedily bought up in miscellanies. In the succeeding reign, some of the
kindred, who had received their edu∣cation at St. <HI>Omers,</HI> thought
themselves on the point of establishing NONSENSE in church and state,
and were preparing to make bonfires on the occasion in <HI>Smithfield,</HI>
when they were obliged to leave the kingdom.</P>
<P>Since the Revolution, the field of Politics has afforded large
scope for NONSENSE and her family to make <PB N="713" REF="288"/> themselves
remarkable. Hence arose the various sects in party, distinguished by
the names of <HI>Whig</HI> and <HI>Tory, Ministerial</HI> and <HI>Jacobite,
Sunderlandians, Oxfordians, Go∣dolphinians, Bolingbrokians, Walpolians,
Pelhamians, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</HI> names, which have kindled as hot a war
in pamphlets and journals, as the <HI>Guelphs</HI> and <HI>Gibilines</HI> in
<HI>Italy,</HI> or the <HI>Big</HI> and <HI>Little-Endians</HI> in the kingdom
of <HI>Lilliput.</HI></P>
<P>I have here endeavoured to give a short abridgement of the
History of NONSENSE; though a very small part of the exploits of the family
can be included in so com∣pendious a chronicle. Some of them were very deep
scho∣lars, and filled the Professors' Chairs at the Universities. They
composed many elaborate dissertations to convince the world, that two and
two make four; and discovered by dint of syllogism, that white is not
black. Their enquiries in Natural Philosophy were no less extraordi∣nary:
many spent their lives and their fortunes in at∣tempting to discover a
wonderful Stone, that should turn every baser metal into gold; and others
employed them∣selves in making artificial wings, by the help of which they
should fly up into the world of the moon. Another branch of the family took
to the <HI>Belles Lettres,</HI> and were the original founders of the learned
Society of <HI>Grub-Street.</HI></P>
<P>Never was any aera in the annals of NONSENSE more illustrious
than the present; nor did that noble family ever more signally
distinguish itself in every occupation. In Oratory, who are greater
proficients than the progeny of NONSENSE? Witness many long and eloquent
speeches delivered in St. <HI>Stephen</HI>'s Chapel, in
<HI>Westminster</HI> Hall, at Assizes and Quarter-Sessions, at
<HI>Clare-Market,</HI> and the <HI>Robin-Hood.</HI>—In Philosophy, what
marvellous things have not been proved by NONSENSE? The sometime
Professor of Astronomy at <HI>Gresham</HI> College shewed Sir
<HI>Isaac Newton</HI> to be a mere ass, and wire∣drawed 
<PB N="714" REF="289"/> the books of <HI>Moses</HI> into a complete system
of Natural Philosophy: Life-guard-men have with the ut∣most certainty of
NONSENSE foretold Earthquakes; and others have penned curious essays on
Air-quakes, Water∣quakes, and Comets.—In Politics, how successfully
have the sons of NONSENSE bandied about the terms of Court and Country? How
wisely have they debated upon Taxes; and with what amazing penetration did
they but lately foresee an Invasion?—In Religion, their domain is
particularly extensive: for, though NONSENSE is ex∣cluded at least from the
first part of the service in all regular churches, yet she often occupies
the whole cere∣mony at the Tabernacle and Foundery in <HI>Moorfields,</HI> and
the Chapel in <HI>Long-Acre.</HI> But for the credit of so po∣lite an age, be
it known, that the children of NON∣SENSE, who are many of them people of
fashion, are as often seen at the Play-house as at Church: and it is
something strange, that the family of NONSENSE is now divided against
itself, and in high contest about the management of their favourite
amusement—the OPERA.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="body of issue">
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HERE is no mark of our confidence taken more kindly by a
friend, than the intrusting him with a secret; nor any which he is so
likely to abuse. Confidantes in general are like crazy fire-locks, which are
no sooner charged and cocked, than the spring gives way, and the report
immediately follows. Happy to have been thought worthy the confidence of one
friend, they are impatient to manifest their importance to another; 'till
between them and their friend, and their friend's friend, the whole matter is
presently known to <HI>all our friends round the Wrekin.</HI> The secret
catches as it were by contact, and like electrical matter breaks forth from
every link in the chain, almost at the <PB N="716" REF="291"/> same
instant. Thus the whole Exchange may be thrown into a buz to morrow, by what
was whispered in the middle of <HI>Marlborough Downs</HI> this morning; and
in a week's time the streets may ring with the intrigue of a woman of
fashion, bellowed out from the foul mouths of the hawkers, though at
present it is known to no creature living but her gallant and her
waiting-maid.</P>
<P>AS the talent of secrecy is of so great importance to
society, and the necessary commerce between individuals cannot be
securely carried on without it, that this deplorable weakness should be
so general is much to be lamented. You may as well pour water into a funnel,
or a sieve, and expect it to be retained there, as commit any of your
concerns to so slippery a companion. It is remarkable, that in those men
who have thus lost the faculty of retention, the desire of being
communicative is always most prevalent where it is least to be justified.
If they are intrusted with a matter of no great moment, affairs of more
consequence will perhaps in a few hours shuffle it entirely out of their
thoughts: but if any thing be delivered to them with an air of earnestness,
a low voice, and the gesture of a man in terror for the con∣sequence of
it's being known; if the door is bolted, and every precaution taken to prevent
a surprise; however they may promise secrecy, and however they may
intend it, the weight upon their minds will be so extremely oppressive,
that it will certainly put their tongues in motion.</P>
<P>THIS breach of trust so universal amongst us, is perhaps
in great measure owing to our education. The first lesson our little
masters and misses are taught, is to become blabs and tell-tales; they
are bribed to divulge the petty intrigues <PB N="717" REF="292"/> of the family
below stairs to pappa and mamma in the parlour, and a doll or a hobby-horse
is generally the encou∣ragement of a propensity which could scarcely be
attoned for by a whipping. As soon as children can lisp out the little
intelligence they have picked up in the hall or the kit∣chen, they are admired
for their wit: if the butler has been caught kissing the housekeeper in
his pantry, or the foot∣man detected in romping with the chambermaid, away
flies little <HI>Tommy</HI> or <HI>Betsy</HI> with the news; the parents are
lost in admiration of the pretty rogue's understanding, and reward such
uncommon ingenuity with a kiss and a sugar-plumb.</P>
<P>NOR does an inclination to secrecy meet with less
encou∣ragement at school. The governantes at the boarding-school teach
miss to be a good girl, and tell them every thing she knows: thus, if any
young lady is unfortunately discovered eating a green apple in a corner, if
she is heard to pronounce a naughty word, or is caught picking the letters
out of another miss's sampler, away runs the chit who is so happy as to
get the start of the rest, screams out her information as she goes, and
the prudent matron chucks her under the chin, and tells her that she is a
good girl, and every body will love her.</P>
<P>THE management of our young gentlemen is equally absurd: In
most of our schools if a lad is discovered in a scrape, the impeachment
of an accomplice, as at the <HI>Old Bailey,</HI> is made the condition of a
pardon. I remember a boy, engaged in robbing an orchard, who was unfortunately
taken prisoner in an apple-tree, and conducted under a strong guard of the
farmer and his dairy-maid, to the master's house. Upon his absolute
refusal to discover his associates, <PB N="718" REF="293"/> the
pedagogue undertook to lash him out of his fidelity, but finding it
impossible to scourge the secret out of him, he at last gave him up
for an obstinate villain, and sent him to his father, who told him he was
ruined, and was going to dis∣inherit him for not betraying his
school-fellows. I must own I am not fond of thus drubbing our youth into
treachery, and am much more pleased with the request of
<HI>Ulysses</HI> when he went to <HI>Troy,</HI> who begged of those who
were to have the charge of <HI>Telemachus,</HI> that they would above all
things teach him to be just, sincere, faithful, and to keep a secret.</P>
<P>EVERY man's experience must have furnished him with
instances of confidantes who are not to be relied on, and friends who are not
to be trusted; but few perhaps have thought it a character so well worth
their attention, as to have marked out the different degrees into which it may
be di∣vided, and the different methods by which secrets are communicated.</P>
<P>NED TRUSTY is a tell-tale of a very singular kind. Ha∣ving
some sense of his duty, he hesitates a little at the breach of it. If
he engages never to utter a syllable, he most punctually performs his
promise; but then he has the knack of insinuating by a nod and a shrug
well-timed, or a sea∣sonable leer, as much as others can convey in
express terms. It is difficult, in short, to determine, whether he is more
to be admired for his resolution in not mentioning, or his in∣genuity in
disclosing a secret. He is also excellent at a 
<Q REND="inline">"doubtful phrase"</Q> as Hamlet calls it, or
an 
<Q REND="inline">"ambiguous giving out,"</Q> and his
conversation consists chiefly of such broken innuendos 
<Q><PB N="719" REF="294"/> 
<L>As, well, I know—or, I could—an if I
would—</L> 
<L>Or, if I list to speak—or, there be, an if there
might &amp;c.</L></Q> Here he generally stops; and leaves it to his hearers
to draw proper inferences from these piece-meal premises. With due
encouragement however, he may be prevailed on to slip the padlock from his
lips, and immediately overwhelms you with a torrent of secret history,
which rushes forth with more violence for having been so long confined.</P>
<P>POOR MEANWELL, though he never fails to transgress, is
rather to be pitied than condemned. To trust him with a secret, is to
spoil his appetite, to break his rest, and to deprive him for a time of
every earthly enjoyment. Like a man who travels with his whole fortune in his
pocket, he is terrified if you approach him, and immediately suspects that
you come with a felonious intent to rob him of his charge. If he ventures
abroad, it is to walk in some unfre∣quented place, where he is least in
danger of an attack. At home, he shuts himself up from his family, paces it
to and fro' in his chamber, and has no relief but from muttering over to
himself, what he longs to publish to the world; and would gladly submit
to the office of town cryer, for the li∣berty of proclaiming it in the market
place. At length however, weary of his burthen, and resolved to bear it no
longer, he consigns it to the custody of the first friend he meets, and
returns to his wife with a cheerful aspect, and wonderfully altered for the
better.</P>
<P>CARELESS is perhaps equally undesigning, though not equally
excusable. Intrust him with an affair of the utmost importance, on the
concealment of which your fortune and happiness depend: he hears you with a
kind of half-atten∣tion; <PB N="720" REF="295"/> whistles a favourite air, and
accompanies it with the drumming of his fingers upon the table. As soon as
your narration is ended, or perhaps in the middle of it, he asks your opinion
of his sword-knot, damns his taylor for having dressed him in a
snuff-colour'd coat instead of a <HI>pompadour,</HI> and leaves you in
haste to attend an auction; where, as if he meant to dispose of his
intelligence to the best bidder, he divulges it with a voice as loud as the
auctioneer's; and when you tax him with having played you false, he is
hear∣tily sorry for it, but never knew that it was to be a secret.</P>
<P>TO these I might add the character of the open and
un∣reserved, who thinks it a breach of friendship to conceal any thing from
his intimates; and the impertinent, who ha∣ving by dint of observation made
himself master of your secret, imagines he may lawfully publish the
knowledge it has cost him so much labour to obtain, and considers that
privilege, as the reward due to his industry. But I shall leave these
with many other characters, which my reader's own experience may suggest to
him, and conclude with pre∣scribing, as a short remedy for this
evil,—That no man may betray the counsel of his friend, let every man
keep his own.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>ASTE is at present the darling idol of the polite world, and
the world of letters; and, indeed, seems to be considered as the
quin∣tessence of almost all the arts and sciences. The fine ladies and
gentlemen dress with Taste; the architects, whether <HI>Gothic</HI> or
<HI>Chinese,</HI> build with Taste; the painters paint with Taste; the
poets write with Taste; critics read with Taste; and in short, fidlers,
players, singers, dancers, and mechanics themselves, are all the sons and
daughters of Taste. Yet in this amazing super∣abundancy of Taste few can
say what it really is, or what the word itself signifies. Should I
attempt to define it in the stile of a <HI>Connoisseur,</HI> I must run
over the names of all the famous poets, painters, and sculptors, ancient and
mo∣dern; <PB N="722" REF="297"/> and after having pompously harangued on the
excel∣lencies of <HI>Apelles, Phidias, Praxiteles, Angela, Rubens,
Poussin,</HI> and <HI>Dominichino,</HI> with a word or two on all
<HI>taste∣ful</HI> compositions, such as those of <HI>Homer, Virgil,
Tasso, Dante,</HI> and <HI>Ariosto,</HI> I should leave the reader in
wonder of my profound erudition, and as little informed as before. But as deep
learning, though more flaming and pompous, is perhaps not always so useful
as common sense, I shall endeavour to get at the true meaning of the word
Taste, by considering what it usually imports in familiar writings and
ordinary conversation.</P>
<P>IT is supposed by <HI>Locke</HI> and other close
reasoners, that words are intended as signs of our ideas: but daily
expe∣rience will convince us, that words are often used to express no ideas
at all. Thus many persons, who talk perpetually of Taste, throw it out as a
mere expletive, without any meaning annexed to it. <HI>Bardolph,</HI> when
demanded the meaning of the word <HI>accommodated,</HI> wisely explains it by
say∣ing that 
<Q REND="inline">"<HI>accommodated,</HI> sir,
is—a—a—a—<HI>accommodated,</HI> sir, is as if one
should say—a—<HI>accommodated:</HI>"</Q> and if in like manner,
you ask one of these people <HI>What is Taste?</HI> they will tell you
that "Taste is a kind of a sort of a—a—a—, in short 
<Q REND="inline">"Taste is Taste."</Q> These talkers must
be con∣sidered as absolute blanks in conversation, since it is
im∣possible to learn the explanation of a term from them, as they affix no
determinate meaning to any expression.</P>
<P>AMONG men of sense, whose words carry meaning in their
sound, Taste is commonly used in one of these two significations.
First, when they give any person the ap∣pellation of a Man of Taste, they
would intimate that he <PB N="723" REF="298"/> has a turn for the polite arts,
as well as the lesser elegancies of life; and that from his natural bent to
those studies, and his acquired knowledge in them, he is capable of
distin∣guishing what is good or bad in any thing of that kind submitted
to his judgment. The meaning at other times implied by a Man of Taste is,
that he is not only so far an adept in those matters as to be able to judge
of them ac∣curately, but is also possessed of the faculty of
executing them gracefully. These two significations will perhaps be more
easily conceived, and clearly illustrated, when applied to our Sensual
Taste. The Man of Taste, according to the first, may be considered as a
<HI>Bon Vivant,</HI> who is fond of the dishes before him, and
distinguishes nicely what is savoury and delicious, or flat and insipid
in the ingredients of each: according to the second, he may be regarded as
the Cook, who from knowing what things will mix well together, and
distinguishing by a nice taste when he has arrived at that happy mixture,
is able to compose such exquisite dishes.</P>
<P>BOTH these significations of the word will be found
agree∣able to the following definition of it, which I have some∣where seen,
and is the only just description of the term, that I ever remember to have
met with. 
<Q REND="inline">"Taste consists in a nice harmony between
the Fancy and the Judgment."</Q> The most chastised judgment, without
genius, can never constitute a Man of Taste; and the most luxuriant
Imagina∣tion, unregulated by Judgment, will only carry us into wild and
extravagant deviations from it. To mix oil, vinegar, butter, milk, eggs,
&amp;c. incoherently together, would make an Olio not to be relished by any
palate; and the man who has no goût for delicacies himself will never
compose a good <PB N="724" REF="299"/> dish, though he should ever so
strictly adhere to the rules of <HI>La Chapelle, Hannah Glasse,</HI> and
<HI>Martha Bradley.</HI> I con∣fine myself at present chiefly to that
signification of the word, which implies the capacity of exerting our own
facul∣ties in the several branches of Taste, because That always includes
the other.</P>
<P>HAVING thus settled what Taste is, it may not be
unen∣tertaining to examine modern Taste by these rules: and perhaps it will
appear, that on the one hand its most pleasing flights and ravishing
elegancies are extravagant and absurd, and that on the other hand those who
affect a correct Taste in all their undertakings, proceed mechanically
without ge∣nius. The first species of Taste, which gives a loose to the
imagination, indulges itself in caprice, and is perpetually striking new
strokes, is the chief regulator of the fashion. In dress, it has put
hunting-poles into the hands of our gentlemen, and erected coaches and
windmills on the heads of our ladies. In equipage, it has built chariots of
<HI>papier maché,</HI> and by putting spotted <HI>Danish</HI>
horses into the harness, has made our beaux look like <HI>Bacchus</HI> in
his car drawn by leopards. The ornaments, both on the outside and inside of
our houses, are all <HI>Gothic</HI> or <HI>Chinese</HI>; and whoever makes
a pagod of his parlour, throws a plank or two with an irre∣gular cross-barred
paling over a dirty ditch, or places battle∣ments on a root-house or a
stable, fits up his house and garden entirely in Taste.</P>
<P>THE second sort of Men of Taste are to be found chiefly
among the Literati, and are those, who despising the mo∣dern whims to
which fashion has given the name of Taste, pretend to follow with the
most scrupulous exactness the <PB N="725" REF="300"/> chaste models of
the antients. These are the poets who favour us with correct, epithetical,
and <HI>tasteful</HI> compositions; whose works are without blemish,
and conformable to the precise rules of <HI>Quintilian, Horace,</HI> and
<HI>Aristotle:</HI> and as they are intended merely for the perusal of
persons of the most refined Taste, it is no wonder that they are above
the level of common understandings. These too are the Critics, who in their
comments upon authors, embarrass us with repeated allusions to the study
of <HI>Virtù:</HI> And these too are the Connoisseurs in
Architecture, who build ruins after <HI>Vi∣truvius,</HI> and necessaries
according to <HI>Palladio.</HI> One gentle∣man of this cast has built his
villa upon a bleak hill, with four spacious porticos, open on each side to
court the four winds; because, in the sultry regions of <HI>Italy,</HI>
this model has been thought most convenient; and another has, in great
measure, shut out the light from his apartments, and cut off all prospect
from his windows, by erecting an high wall be∣fore his house, which in
<HI>Italy</HI> has been judged necessary to screen them from the
sun.</P>
<P>ARCHITECTURE seems indeed to be the main article, in which the
efforts of Taste are now displayed. Among those who are fond of exerting
their fancies in capricious innova∣tions, I might instance the many pretty
whims, of which an infinite variety may be seen within ten miles of
<HI>London.</HI> But us a proof of the noble and judicious Taste among us, I
shall beg leave to describe, in the stile of a Connoisseur, a most
amazing curiosity, erected in a very polite quarter of this town.</P>
<P>IN the midst of a noble and spacious area stands a grand
Obelisk. The Base forms a perfect square with right <PB N="726" REF="301"/> angles; the Body of it is cylindrical; but the Capital is an
Heptagon, and has several curious lines and figures described on each of
its seven flat sides or superfices, which serve to terminate as many
most magnificent and striking Vistas. This superb Column, no less
remarkable than the famous Pillar of <HI>Trajan,</HI> seems (from the
several Gnomons and other Hieroglyphics stuck about it) to have been
originally dedicated to the Sun; but is now known among the vulgar by the more
common name of <HI>The Seven Dials.</HI></P>

<DIV2 TYPE="body of issue">
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HOUGH I shall not as yet vouchsafe to let the reader so
far into my secrets, as to inform him whether I am married or single, it
may not be amiss to ac∣quaint him, that supposing I still remain a
batchelor, it has not been the fault of my friends or relations. On the
contrary, as soon as I was what they call settled in the world, they were
so assiduous in looking out for a wife for me, that nothing 
<PB N="728" REF="303"/> was required on my part, but immediately to fall in love
with the lady they had pitched upon: and could I have complied with their
several choices, I should have been married at the same time to a tall
and a short, a plump and a slender, a young and an old woman; one with a
great deal of money, and another with none at all: each of whom were
separately recommended by them as the properest person in the world for
me.</P>
<P>I know not how it happens, but it is notorious, that most
people take a pleasure in making matches; either thinking matrimony a state
of bliss, into which they would charitably call all their friends and
acquaintance; or perhaps struggling in the toils, they are desirous of
catching others in the net that ensnared them. Many matches have been brought
about between two persons absolute strangers to each other, through this
kind mediation of our friends, who are always ready to take upon them the
office of an honourable go-between. Some have come together merely from having
been talked of by their acquaintance as likely to make a match; and I have
known a couple, who have met by accident at an horse-race, or danced together
at an assembly, that in less than a fortnight have been driven into
matrimony in their own defence, by having been first paired in private
conversations, and afterwards in the common news-papers.</P>
<P>As we cannot insure happiness to our friends, at the same
time that we help them to husbands or wives, one would imagine that few would
care to run the ha∣zard <PB N="729" REF="304"/> of bestowing misery, where
they meant a kindness. I know a good-natured lady, who has officiously
brought upon herself the ill-will and the curses of many of her dearest
and most intimate friends on this very account. She has a sister, for
whom she provided a most excellent husband, who has shewn his affection
for her by spend∣ing her whole fortune upon his mistresses: she
con∣trived, that another near relation should snap up a rich widow, who was
arrested for her debts within a week after marriage; and it cost her a
whole twelvemonth to bring two doating lovers of her acquaintance together, who
parted beds before the honey-moon was expired.</P>
<P>But if our friends will thus condescend to be Match-makers
from a spirit of benevolence, and for our own ad∣vantage only, there are
others who have taken up the pro∣fession from less disinterested
motives; who bring beauty and fortune to market, and traffick in all the
accomplish∣ments that can make the marriage state happy. These traders
dispose of all sorts of rich heirs and heiresses, ba∣ronets, lords,
ladies of fashion, and daughters of country squires with as much coolness
as drovers sell bullocks. They keep complete registers of the condition and
quali∣fications of all the marriageable persons within the king∣dom; and it
is as common to apply to them for an husband or wife, as to the
register-offices for a man or maid-servant. They may, indeed, be
considered as fa∣thers and guardians for the greatest part of our youth of
both sexes, since in marriage they may be most properly said to give
them away.</P>
<P><PB N="730" REF="305"/>It is something comical to consider
the various persons, to whom men of this profession are useful. We may
naturally suppose, that a young fellow, who has no estate, but what, like
<HI>Tinsel</HI>'s in the <HI>Drummer,</HI> is merely <HI>personal,</HI>
would be glad to come down handsomely after consummation with a woman of
fortune; and a smart girl, who has more charms than wealth, would give round
poundage on being taken for better for worse by a rich heir. Many a
tradesman also wants a wife to manage his family, while he looks after the
shop; and thinks it better to recommend himself by this convenient friend,
than by means of the <HI>Daily Advertiser.</HI> There are also several
young people, who are indifferent as to any person in particular, and have no
passion for the state itself, yet want to be married, because it will
deliver them from the restraint of parents. But the most unnatural, though
very common applications of this sort are from the rich and the noble; who
having immense estates to bestow on their children, will make use of
the meanest instruments to couple them to another of the same over∣grown
fortune.</P>
<P>I have known many droll accidents happen from the mistakes of
these mercenary Match-makers, and remem∣ber one in particular, which I
shall here set down for the entertainment of my readers. A careful old
gen∣tleman came up from the North on purpose to marry his son, and was
recommended by one of these couplers to a twenty thousand pounder. He
accordingly put on his best wig, best beaver, and gold-buttoned coat, and
went to pay his respects to the lady's mamma: He told her, 
<PB N="731" REF="306"/> that he had not the pleasure of being known to her;
but as his son's quiet depended on it, he had taken the liberty of waiting on
her: in short, he at length broke the matter to her, and informed her, that
his boy had seen her daughter at church, and was violently in love with her;
concluding, that he would do very hand∣somely for the lad, and would make it
worth her while to have him. The old lady thanked him for the ho∣nour he
intended her family; but she supposed, to be sure, as he appeared to be
a prudent and sensible gentle∣tleman he would expect a fortune
answerable. 
<Q REND="inline">"Say nothing of that, madam, say nothing of
that",</Q> inter∣rupted the Don;— 
<Q REND="inline">"I have heard—but if it was less, it
should not break any squares between us."—</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">"Pray, sir, how much does the world
say?"</Q> replied the lady.— 
<Q REND="inline">"Why, madam, I suppose she has not less
than twenty thousand pounds.—"</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">"<HI>Not so much, sir;</HI>"</Q> said the
old lady, very gravely.— 
<Q REND="inline">"Well, madam, I suppose then it may be
nineteen, or—or—only eighteen thousand pounds".—</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">"<HI>Not so much, sir.;</HI>"—</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">"Well, well, per∣haps not: but—if it was
only seventeen thousand."—</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">"No, sir."—</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">"Or sixteen".—</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">"No."—</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">"Or (we must make allowances) perhaps but
fifteen thousand".—</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">"<HI>Not so much, sir.</HI>"—</Q>Here
ensued a profound silence for near a minute; when the old gentleman,
rubbing his fore-head— 
<Q REND="inline">"Well, madam, we must come to some
con∣clusion—Pray is it less than fourteen thousand? How much more
is it than twelve thousand?"—</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">"Less, sir."—</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">"<HI>Less, madam?—</HI>"</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">"Less."—</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">"But is it more than ten thousand?"—</Q>

<Q REND="inline">"<HI>Not so much, sir.</HI>"—</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">"Not so much, madam?"—</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">"<HI>Not so much.</HI>"—</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">"Why, <PB N="732" REF="307"/> if it is lodged in
the funds, consider, madam, interest is low, very low—but as the boy
loves her, trifles shall not part us. Has she got eight thousand
Pounds?"—</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">"<HI>Not so much, sir.</HI>"—</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">"Why then, madam, perhaps the young lady's
fortune may not be above six—or five thousand pounds."—</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">"NOTHING LIKE IT, SIR."—</Q>At these
words the old gentleman started from his chair, and running out of the
room— 
<Q REND="inline">"Your servant, your servant—my son
is a fool; and the fellow who recommended me to you is a blockhead, and knows
nothing of business."</Q></P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> MENTIONED in a former paper, that a friend of mine was
writing <HI>A New Treatise on Ethics,</HI> or, <HI>A System of Immoral
Philosophy,</HI> compiled from the principles and practice of the present
age; in which the extraordinary modesty of the Mo∣derns would be enlarged on,
which has induced them to comprehend all the vices, instead of virtues, in
their idea of a Fine Gentleman. The work is now finished; and the Author has
sent me the following letter concerning the Dedication, with leave to
submit it to the public.</P>
<LETTER>
<PB N="734" REF="309"/>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>DEAR TOWN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE flatness and fulsom insipidity of Dedications has
often been the subject of our conversation; and we have always agreed, that
Authors have miscarried in these pieces of flattery, by injudiciously
affronting, when they meant to compliment their patrons. The humble Dedicator
loads his Great Man with virtues totally foreign to his nature and
disposition, which sit as aukwardly upon him, as lace or embroidery on a
chimney-sweeper: and so overwhelms him with the huge mass of learning,
with which he graciously dubs him a scholar, that he makes as ridiculous a
figure as the Ass in the <HI>Dunciad.</HI> After having thus bepraised his
patron, till the new <HI>Maecenas</HI> is heartily ashamed of himself, he
wonders that no notice is taken of so pompous an eulogium, and that a
Dedi∣cation should be as mere a drug as a sermon.</P>
<P><HI>Lory</HI> in the <HI>Relapse</HI> advises
<HI>Fashion</HI> to get into the good graces of Lord <HI>Foppington</HI> by
falling in love with his coat, being in raptures with his peruke, ravished
with the gen∣teel dangle of his sword-knot; and, in short, to recom∣mend
himself to his noble elder brother, by seeming to be captivated with his
favourites. In like manner, the au∣thor, who would make his Dedication really
valuable, should not talk to his patron of his honour, and virtue, and
integrity, and a pack of unfashionable qualities, which only serve to
disgrace a Fine Gentleman, but boldly paint him what he really is, and at the
same time convince him of his merit in being a fool, and his glory in being a
scoundrel. This mode of Dedication, though proper at all times, will appear
with a particular good grace, before a <HI>System of Immoral
Philosophy:</HI> where∣fore, <PB N="735" REF="310"/> as my book is now
finished, I have here sent you a rough draught of the Epistle Dedicatory,
and shall be glad to hear your opinion of it.</P>
<Q><HI>May it please your Grace!</HI> or, <HI>My Lord!</HI> or,
<HI>Sir!</HI></Q>
<P>YOU are in every point so complete a Fine Gentle∣man, that
the following treatise is but a faint transcript of your accomplishments.
There is not one qualification, requisite in the character of a man of
spirit, which you do not possess. Give me leave therefore, on the
present occasion, to point forth your inestimable qualities to the world,
and hold up to the public view so glorious an example.</P>
<P>YOU distinguished yourself so early in life, and
exalted yourself so far above the common pitch of vulgar Bucks, that you
was distinguished, before the age of twenty, with the noble appellation of
STAG. And when I con∣sider the many gallant exploits you have performed, the
number of rascally poltroons you have sent out of the world, the number of
pretty little foundlings you have brought into it, how many girls you have
debauched, how many women of quality you have intrigued with, and how many
hogsheads of <HI>French</HI> wine have run through your body, I cannot help
contemplating you as a STAG of the first head.</P>
<P>WHAT great reason have you to value yourself on your noble
Atchievements at <HI>Arthur</HI>'s! the sums you formerly lost, and those
you have lately won, are amazing instances of your spirit and address;
first, in venturing so deeply before you was let into the secret, and
then, in manag∣ing it with so much adroitness and dexterity, since you 
<PB N="736" REF="311"/> have been acquainted with it. Nobody cogs the dice, or
packs the cards half so skilfully; you hedge a bet with uncommon nicety;
and are a most incomparably shrewd judge of the odds.</P>
<P>NOR have your exploits on the Turf rendered you less famous.
Let the annals of <HI>Pond</HI> and <HI>Heber</HI> deliver down to posterity
the glorious account of what plates you have won, what matches you made, and
how often the Knowing Ones have been taken in, when, for private reasons, you
have found it necessary that your horse should run on the wrong side
of the post, or be di∣stanced, after winning the first heat. I need not
mention your own skill in Horsemanship, and in how many matches you have
condescended to ride yourself; for in this particular it must be
acknowledged that you cannot be outdone even by your groom or jockey.</P>
<P>ALL the world will witness the many instances of your
Courage, which has been often tried and exerted in <HI>Hyde-Park,</HI> and
behind <HI>Montague-House:</HI> nay, you have sometimes been known to draw
your sword most heroicly at the opera, the play, and even at private routes
and assemblies. How often have you put to flight a whole army of watchmen,
constables, and beadles, with the justices at their head! You have cleared
a whole bawdy-house before you, and taken many a tavern by storm: you have
pinned a waiter to the ground, and have besides proved yourself an
ex∣cellent marksman, by shooting a post-boy flying. With so much valour
and firmness, it is not to be doubted, but that you would behave with the
same intrepidity, if occasions called, upon <HI>Hounslow-Heath,</HI> or
in <HI>Maiden-head-Thicket:</HI> <PB N="737" REF="312"/> and, if it were
necessary, you would as boldly resign yourself up to the hands of
<HI>Jack Ketch,</HI> and swing as genteely as <HI>Maclean</HI> or
<HI>Gentleman Harry.</HI> The same noble spirit would likewise enable you
to aim the pistol at your own head, and go out of the world like a man of
honour and a gentleman.</P>
<P>BUT your Courage has not rendered you insusceptible of the
softer passions, for which your heart has been ever inclined. To say
nothing of your gallantries with women of fashion, your intrigues with
milliners and mantua-makers, or your seducing of raw country girls, and
innocent tradesmens daughters, you have formerly been so constant in your
devoirs to Mrs. <HI>Douglass,</HI> and the whole sister-hood, that you
sacrificed your health and constitution in their service. But above all,
witness that sweet delicate creature, whom you have now in keeping; and for
whom you entertain such a strong and faithful passion, that for her
sake you have tenderly and affectionately deserted your wife and
family.</P>
<P>THOUGH from your elegant taste for pleasures you appear
made for the gay world, yet these polite Amuse∣ments have not called off
your attention from the more serious studies of Politics and Religion. In
Politics you have made such a wonderful proficiency, both in theory and
practice, that you have discovered the good of your country to be a mere
joke, and confirmed your own interest, as well as established your
conse∣quence in the proper place, by securing half a dozen Boroughs. As to
Religion, you soon unravelled every mystery of that, and not only know the
Bible to be as romantic as the Alcoran, but have also written several 
<PB N="738" REF="313"/> volumes to make your discoveries plain to meaner
capa∣cities. The ridiculous prejudices of a foolish world un∣happily prevent
your publishing them at present; but you have wisely provided that they
shall one day see the light, when I doubt not they will be deemed
invaluable, and be as universally admired as the posthumous works of Lord
<HI>Bolingbroke.</HI></P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>I am, May it please your Grace, <HI>or,</HI> My
Lord, <HI>or,</HI> Sir, in humble admiration of your excellencies, <HI>&amp;c.
&amp;c. &amp;c.</HI></SIGNED></CLOSER>

</EPIGRAPH>
<DIV2 TYPE="body of issue">
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE notices in the public papers that the Foundling Hospital
will be open for the reception of all infants in general under a certain age,
have, I find, given uni∣versal satisfaction. The consequences of a big
belly do not appear so dreadful as heretofore: and it was but yesterday
that a young fellow of intrigue told me, he was happy that his children would
no longer be thrown out of the Hospital, as he himself was out of
<HI>Arthur</HI>'s, by black balls. For my part, though I have no lady in
keeping, no child by my house-keeper, nor any other affair of gallantry on my
<PB N="740" REF="315"/> hands, which makes me wish to swell the number of
infants maintained by that charity, I must own myself to be exceedingly
rejoiced at the extension of so benevo∣lent a design. I look upon it as
the certain preservation of many hundreds in embryo: nor shall we now hear
of so many helpless babes birth-strangled in a necessary, or
smothered by the ditch-delivered drab. As a bastard is accounted in law,
<HI>quasi nullius filius,</HI> the child of no∣body, and related to nobody,
and yet is blest with as fair proportions, and capable of an equal degree of
per∣fection with 
<Q REND="inline">"honest madam's issue,"</Q> it is surely
an act of great humanity thus to rescue them from untimely deaths and other
miseries, which They do not merit, whatever may be the guilt of their
parents.</P>
<P>THOUGH it is obvious, that this Hospital will be made the
receptacle of many legitimate children, it is no less certain that the rich,
as well as the poor, will often send their base-born bantlings to this
general nursery. The wealthy man of quality, or substantial cit, may have
their private family-reasons for not owning the fruits of their secret
amours, and be glad to put the little living witness of their intrigues out
of the way. For this reason, an history of the Foundlings received there
would be very curious and entertaining, as it would contain many anec∣dotes not
to be learned from any Parish Register. The reflections that passed in
my mind on this subject, gave occasion the other evening to the following
Dream.</P>
<P>Methought, as I was standing at the private door of the
Hospital, where a croud of females (each of them with a child in her arms)
were pressing to get in, an elderly gentleman, whom from his white staff
I took to <PB N="741" REF="316"/> be a governour of the charity, very
courteously invited me to come in. I accepted his offer; and having seated
myself next him— 
<Q REND="inline">"Mr. TOWN, says he, I am con∣scious that you
look upon most these little infants as the offsprings of so many
unmarried fathers, and maiden-mothers, which have been clandestinely
smuggled into the world. Know then that I am one of those guar∣dian Genii,
appointed to superintend the fortunes of Bastards: therefore, as this
Hospital is more immedi∣ately under my tuition, I have put on this
disguise; and, if you please, will let you into the secret history of
those babes, who are my wards, and their parents."</Q></P>
<P>I assured him, his intelligence would be highly agree∣able;
and several now coming up to offer their children, he resumed his
discourse— 
<Q REND="inline">"Observe, said he, that jolly little rogue,
with plump cheeks, a florid com∣plexion, blue eyes, and sandy locks. We have
here already several of his brethren by the mother's side; some fair,
some brown, and some black: and yet they are all supposed to have come
by the same father. The mother has for many years been housekeeper to a
gentleman who cannot see that her children bear the marks of his own
servants, and that this very brat is the exact resemblance of his
coachman.</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">"THAT puling whining infant there, with a pale
face, emaciated body, and distorted limbs, is the forced pro∣duct of
viper-broth and cantharides. It is the offspring of a worn-out buck of quality,
who at the same time he debauched the mother, ruined her constitution by a
filthy disease; in consequence of which, she with much 
<PB N="742" REF="317"/> difficulty brought forth this just picture of
himself in miniature.</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">"THE next that offers is the issue of a
careful cit; who, as he keeps an horse for his own riding on sundays, which
he lets out all the rest of the week, keeps also a mistress for his
recreation on the seventh day, who lets herself out on all the other six.
That other babe owes his birth likewise to the city, but is the joint
product, as we may say, of two fathers; who being great oeconomists in
their pleasures as well as in their business, have set up a whore and
an one horse-chaise in partnership together.</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">"THAT pert young baggage there, who so boldly
presses forward with her brat, is not the mother of it, but is maid to a
single lady of the strictest honour and unblemished reputation. About a
twelve month, ago her mistress went to <HI>Bath</HI> for the benefit of her
health; and ten months after, she travelled into <HI>North Wales</HI> to
see a relation; from whence she is just returned. We may suppose,
that she took a fancy to that pretty babe while in the country, and brought
it up to town with her, in order to place it here; as she did a few years ago
to another charming boy, which being too old to be got into this Hospital, is
now at a school in <HI>Yorkshire,</HI> where young gentlemen are boarded,
cloath∣ed, and educated, and found in all necessaries, for ten pounds a
year.</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">"THAT chubby little boy, which you see in the
arms of yonder strapping wench in a camblet gown and red cloak, is her own
son. She is by profession a bed-maker <PB N="743" REF="318"/> in one of
the universities, and of the same college, in which the father (a grave
tutor) holds a fellowship under the usual condition of not marrying. Many
sober gentlemen of the cloth, who are in the same scrape, are glad to
take the benefit of this charity: And if all of the same reverend order, like
the priests abroad, were laid under the same restrictions, you might
expect to see a particular Hospital, erected for the reception of the Sons
of the Clergy.</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">"THAT next child belongs to a sea-captain's
lady, whose husband is expected to return every moment from a long voyage;
the fears of which have happily hastened the birth of this infant a full
month before its time. That other is the posthumous child of a wealthy old
gentleman, who had married a young girl for love, and dyed in the honey-moon.
This his son and heir was not born till near a twelve month after his
decease, because its birth was retarded by the ex∣cessive grief of his
widow; who on that account ra∣ther chose to lye-in privately, and to lodge
their only child here, than to have its legitimacy and her own honour called in
question by her husband's relations."</Q></P>
<P>MY companion pointed out to me several others no less
extraordinary; among which I remember he told me, one was the unhallowed brood
of a Methodist teacher, and another the premature spawn of a Maid of
honour. A poor author eased himself of a very heavy load of two
twin-daughters, which in an evil hour he begot on an hawker of pamphlets, after
he had been writing a luscious novel: but I could not help smiling at the
marks sent in with these new Muses, signifying, that one had been 
<PB N="744" REF="319"/> christened <HI>Terpsichore,</HI> and the other
<HI>Polyhymnia.</HI> Several bantlings were imported from <HI>Islington,
Hoxton,</HI> and other villages within the sound of <HI>Bow Bell:</HI> many
were transplanted hither out of the country; and a whole litter of brats were
sent in from two or three parishes in particular, for which it is doubtful
whether they were most indebted, to the parson or the squire.</P>
<P>A modest-looking woman now brought a very fine babe to be
admitted; but the governors rejected it, as it appeared to be above two months
old. The mother on the contrary persisted in affirming, that it was but
just born, and addressing herself to me, desired me to look at it. I
accordingly took it in my arms; and while I was tossing it up and down, and
praising its beauty, the sly hussy contrived to slip away, leaving
the precious charge to my care. The efforts which I made to bawl after her, and
the squalling of the brat which rung pite∣ously in my ears, luckily awaked
me; and I was very happy to find, that I had only been dandling my pillow
instead of a bantling.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>LMOST every man is or has been, or at least thinks that he
is or has been a Lover. One has fought for his mistress, another has drank
for her, another wrote for her, and another has done all three: and yet perhaps
in spite of their duels, poetry, and bumpers, not one of them ever
entertained a sincere passion. I have lately taken a survey of the
numerous tribe of <HI>Enamoratos,</HI> and after having observed the various
shapes they wear, think I <PB N="746" REF="321"/> may safely pronounce, that
though all profess to have been in Love, there are very few who are really
capable of it.</P>
<P>IT is a maxim of <HI>Rochefoucault</HI>'s, that, 
<Q REND="inline">"many men would never have been in Love, if they
had never heard of Love."</Q> The justice of this remark is equal to its
shrewdness. The ridiculous prate of a family has frequently great influence
on young minds, who learn to Love, as they do every thing else, by imitation.
Young crea∣tures, almost mere children, have been consumed with this
second-hand flame lighted up at another's passion; and in consequence
of the loves of the footman and chambermaid, I have known little master fancy
himself a dying swain at the age of thirteen, and little miss pining away
with Love in a bib and hanging sleeves.</P>
<P>THAT vast heap of volumes, filled with Love, and suffi∣cient
in number to make a library, are great inflamers, and seldom fail to produce
that kind of passion described by <HI>Rochefoucault.</HI> The chief of
these literary seducers are the old romances, and their degenerate spawn,
the modern no∣vels. The young student reads of the emotions of Love, till he
imagines that he feels them throbbing and fluttering in his little breast; as
valetudinarians study the history of a disease, till they fancy
themselves affected with every symp∣tom of it. For this reason, I am
always sorry to see any of this trash in the hands of young people: I
look upon <HI>Cassandra</HI> and <HI>Cleopatra</HI> as well as <HI>Betty
Barnes, Polly Willis,</HI> &amp;c. as no better than bawds; and consider Don
<HI>Bellianis</HI> of <HI>Greece,</HI> and Sir <HI>Amadis de Gaul,</HI> with
<HI>George Edwards, Loveill,</HI> &amp;c. as arrant pimps. But though romances
and novels are both equally stimulatives, yet their operations are very
different. <PB N="747" REF="322"/> The romance-student becomes a fond
<HI>Corydon</HI> of <HI>Sicily,</HI> or a very <HI>Damon</HI> of
<HI>Arcadia,</HI> and is in good truth such a dying swain, that he believes
he shall hang himself on the next willow, or drown himself in the next
pond, if he should lose the object of his wishes: but the young
novelist turns out more a man of the world, and after having gained the
affections of his mistress, forms a hundred schemes to secure the
possession of her, and to bam her relations.</P>
<P>THERE are, among the tribe of Lovers, a sort of luke∣warm
gentlemen, who can hardly be said, in the language of Love, to entertain a
<HI>flame</HI> for their mistress. These are your men of superlative
delicacy and refinement, who loath the gross ideas annexed to the amours of
the vulgar, and aim at something more spiritualized and sublime. These
philosophers in Love doat on the mind alone of their mistress, and would
fain see her naked soul, diverted of its material incumbrances. Gentlemen
of this complexion might per∣haps not improperly be ranged in the romantic
class, but they have assumed to themselves the name of <HI>Platonic
Lovers.</HI></P>
<P>PLATONISM, however, is in these days very scarce; and there
is another class, infinitely more numerous, composed of a sort of Lovers,
whom we may justly distinguish by the title of <HI>Epicureans.</HI> The
principles of this sect are diametri∣cally opposite to those of the
<HI>Platonics.</HI> They think no more of the soul of their mistress,
than a mussulman, but are in raptures with her person. A Lover of this
sort is in perpetual extasies: his passion is so violent that he even
scorches you with his flame; and he runs over the perfec∣tions of his
mistress in the same stile that a jockey praises his 
<PB N="748" REF="323"/> horse. 
<Q REND="inline">"Such limbs! such eyes! such a neck and
breast! such—oh, she's a rare piece."</Q> Their ideas go no farther
than mere external accomplishments; and as their wounds may be said to be
only skin deep, we cannot allow their breasts to be smitten with Love,
though perhaps they may rankle with a much grosser passion. Yet it
must be owned that nothing is more common, than for gentlemen of this cast
to be involved in what is called a Love-match: but then it is owing to the
same cause with the marriage of Sir <HI>John Brute,</HI> who says, 
<Q REND="inline">"I married my wife, because I wanted to lie
with her, and she would not let me."</Q></P>
<P>OTHER gentlemen of a gay disposition and warm
consti∣tution, who go in the catalogue for Lovers, are adorers of almost
every woman they see. The flame of Love is as easily kindled in them, as
the sparks are struck out of a flint, and it also expires as soon. A
Lover of this sort dances one day with a lady at a ball, and loses his
heart to her in a minuet; the next another carries it off in the mall; and the
next day perhaps he goes out of town, and lodges it in the possession
of all the country beauties successively, till at last he brings it
back to town with him, and presents it to the first woman he meets. This
class is very numerous; but ought by no means to hold a place among the tribe
of true Lovers, since a gentleman who is thus in Love with every body, may
fairly be said not to be in Love at all.</P>
<P>LOVE is universally allowed to be whimsical; and if whim is
the essence of Love, none can be accounted truer Lovers, than those who
admire their mistress for some particular charm, which enchains them,
though it would singly never captivate any body else. Some gentlemen have
been won <PB N="749" REF="324"/> to conjugal embraces by a pair of fine arms;
others have been held fast by an even white set of teeth; and I know a very
good scholar, who was ensnared by a set of golden tresses, because
it was the taste of the antients, and the true classical hair. Those
ladies, whose lovers are such piecemeal admirers, are in perpetual danger
of losing them. A rash, or a pimple may abate their affection: All those,
the object of whose adoration is merely a pretty face or a fine person, are
in the power of the like accidents; and the small pox has occasioned many a
poor lady the loss of her beauty and her Lover at the same time.</P>
<P>BUT after all these spurious <HI>Enamoratos,</HI> there are
some few, whose passion is sincere and well-founded. True, ge∣nuine
Love is always built upon esteem: not that I would mean that a man can
reason and argue himself into Love; but that a constant intercourse
with an amiable woman will lead him into a contemplation of her excellent
qualities, which will insensibly win his heart before he is himself aware
of it, and beget all those hopes, fears, and other extrava∣gances, which are
the natural attendants on a true passion. Love has been described ten
thousand times: but that I may be sure that the little picture I would draw
of it is taken from nature, I will conclude this paper with the story of
honest WILL EASY and his amiable wife. WILL EASY and Miss — became
very early acquainted, and from being familiarly intimate with the whole
family, WILL might be almost said to live there. He dined and supped with
them perpetually in town, and spent great part of the summer with them at
their seat in the country. WILL and the lady were both universally allowed
to have sense, and their fre∣quent conversations together gave them
undoubted proofs of <PB N="750" REF="325"/> the goodness of each other's
disposition. They delighted in the company, and admired the perfections of
each other, and gave a thousand little indications of a growing passion,
not unobserved by others, even while it was yet unknown and unsuspected
even by themselves. However, after some time WILL, by mutual agreement,
demanded the lady of her father in marriage. But alas! 
<Q REND="inline">"the course of true Love never yet run
smooth:"</Q> the ill-judged ambition of a parent induced the father, out of
mere love to his daugh∣ter, to refuse her hand to the only man in the world
with whom she could live happily, because he imagined that he might in the
<HI>Smithfield</HI> phrase, do <HI>better</HI> for her. But Love, grounded on
just principles, is not easily shaken; and as it appeared that their
mutual passion had taken too deep root ever to be extirpated; the father at
last reluctantly half-consented to their union. They enjoy a genteel
competency, and WILL by his integrity and abilities is an honour to a learned
profession, and a blessing to his wife; whose greatest praise is,
that her virtues deserve such an husband. She is pleased with having 
<Q REND="inline">"left dross to duchesses."</Q> He
considers her happiness as his main in∣terest, and their example every
day gives fresh conviction to the father, that where two persons of
strong sense and good hearts, conceive a reciprocal affection for each
other, their passion is genuine and lasting, and their union is perhaps
the truest state of happiness under the sun.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR Essay on the abuse of words was very well received
here, but more especially that part of it, which contained the modern
definition of the word RUINED. You must know, Sir, that in the language of
our old Dons, every young man is <HI>ruined,</HI> who is not an arrant
<HI>Tycho Brahe,</HI> or <HI>Erra Pater.</HI> Yet it is re∣markable, that
though the servants of the Muses meet with more than ordinary
discouragement at this place, yet <HI>Cambridge</HI> has produced many
celebrated poets: witness <HI>Spenser, Milton, Cowley, Dryden,</HI> &amp;c.
not to men∣tion some admired writers of the present times. I my∣self,
Sir, am grievously suspected of being better ac∣quainted with
<HI>Homer</HI> and <HI>Virgil</HI> than <HI>Euclid</HI> or
<HI>Sander∣son;</HI> and am universally agreed to be <HI>ruined</HI> for
having concerned myself with Hexameter and Pentameter more than Diameter. The
equity of this decision I shall not <PB N="755" REF="330"/> dispute, but
content myself at present with submitting to the publick, by means of
your paper, the following lines on the import of another favourite word,
occasioned by the essay above mentioned.</P>
<Q> 
<LG>
<L>WORDS are, so <HI>Wollaston</HI> defines,</L>
<L>Of our ideas merely signs,</L>
<L>Which have a pow'r at will to vary,</L>
<L>As being vague and arbitrary.</L>
<L>Now <HI>damn'd,</HI> for instance—All agree</L>
<L><HI>Damn'd</HI>'s the <HI>superlative Degree</HI>;</L>
<L>Means <HI>that</HI> alone, and nothing more,</L>
<L>However taken heretofore.</L>
<L><HI>Damn'd</HI> is a word can't stand alone,</L>
<L>Which has no meaning of its own;</L>
<L>But signifies or bad or good,</L>
<L>Just as its neighbour's understood.</L>
<L>Examples we may find enough,</L>
<L><HI>Damn'd</HI> high, <HI>damn'd</HI> low, <HI>damn'd</HI>
fire, <HI>damn'd</HI> stuff.</L>
<L>So fares it too with its relation,</L>
<L>I mean its substantive <HI>damnation.</HI></L>
<L>The wit with metaphors makes bold,</L>
<L>And tells you he's <HI>damnation</HI> cold:</L>
<L>Perhaps, that metaphor forgot,</L>
<L>The self-same wit's <HI>damnation</HI> hot.</L>
</LG> 
<LG>
<L>AND here a fable I remember—</L>
<L>Once in the middle of <HI>December,</HI></L>
<L>When ev'ry mead in snow was lost,</L>
<L>And ev'ry river bound with frost,</L>
<L>When families got all together,</L>
<L>And feelingly talk o'er the weather;</L>
<L>When—pox of the descriptive rhime—</L>
<L>In short, it was the winter time.</L>
<L>It was a pedlar's happy lot</L>
<L>To fall into a <HI>Satyr</HI>'s cot:</L>
<L>Shiv'ring with cold and almost froze,</L>
<L>With pearly drop upon his nose,</L>
<L>His fingers ends all pinch'd to death,</L>
<L>He blew upon them with his breath.</L>
<L><PB N="756" REF="331"/>Friend, quoth the <HI>Satyr,</HI>
what intends</L>
<L>That blowing on thy fingers ends?</L>
<L>"It is to warm them, thus I blow,</L>
<L>"For they are froze as cold as snow;</L>
<L>"And so inclement has it been,</L>
<L>"I'm like a cake of ice within."</L>
<L>Come, quoth the <HI>Satyr,</HI> comfort, then!</L>
<L>I'll chear thy inside, if I can;</L>
<L>You're welcome in my homely cottage</L>
<L>To a warm fire and mess of pottage.</L>
</LG> 
<LG>
<L>THIS said, the <HI>Satyr</HI> nothing loth</L>
<L>A bowl prepar'd of sav'ry broth,</L>
<L>Which with delight the pedlar view'd,</L>
<L>As smoaking on the board it stood.</L>
<L>But though the very steam arose</L>
<L>With grateful odour to his nose,</L>
<L>One single sip he ventur'd not,</L>
<L>The gruel was so wondrous hot.</L>
<L>What can be done?—with gentle puff</L>
<L>He blows it, till it's cool enough.</L>
</LG> 
<LG>
<L>WHY how now, pedlar, what's the matter?</L>
<L>Still at thy blowing, quoth the <HI>Satyr.</HI></L>
<L>I blow to cool it, cries the clown,</L>
<L>That I may get the liquor down,</L>
<L>For tho' I grant you've made it well,</L>
<L>You've boil'd it, Sir, as hot as hell.</L>
</LG> 
<LG>
<L>THEN raising high his cloven stump,</L>
<L>The <HI>Satyr</HI> smote him on the rump.</L>
<L>"Begone, thou double knave or fool,</L>
<L>"With the same breath to warm and cool:</L>
<L>"Friendship with such I never hold</L>
<L>"Who're so <HI>damn'd</HI> hot, and so <HI>damn'd</HI>

<L>Proinde tona eloquio, solitum tibi—</L> 
<BIBL>VIRG.</BIBL></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<DIV2 TYPE="body of issue">
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> Remember a rector of a parish at the court end of the town,
who was gene∣rally accounted a very fine preacher, that used to aim at
delivering himself in the most bold and animated stile of oratory. The
tone of his voice was nicely accommodated to the different branches of his
dis∣course, and every thing was pronounced with uncommon energy and
emphasis; he also indulged himself in equal freedom of action, and
abounded in various extraordi∣nary gesticulations; his sermons themselves
were sown thick with tropes, metaphors, and similies, and every where
enriched with <HI>apostrophe</HI> and <HI>prosopopaeia.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="758" REF="333"/>AS I knew that this reverend gentleman had
been abroad with a young nobleman in the capacity of a tra∣velling tutor, I did
not wonder at the violent exertion of his voice, and the vehemence of his
action; as this is a piece of clerical foppery, which an itinerant clergyman is
apt to adopt, while his pupil is gleaning all the other follies of
<HI>Paris:</HI> at which place it is very common to see a <HI>capuchine</HI>
so heated with his subject, that he often seems in danger of throwing
himself out of the pulpit. But I was at a loss how to account for the
glowing stile of his discourses, till happening to turn over the works of
a celebrated <HI>French</HI> preacher, I found that the oratorical performances
of my friend were no other than faithful translations of them.</P>
<P>THIS sort of pulpit plagiarism may perhaps be more adapted
to the taste of some of our fashionable de∣claimers, than the more
hackneyed method of tran∣scribing a page from <HI>Barrow, Tillotson,</HI>
or <HI>Atterbury:</HI> but although such practices may be less liable to
de∣tection, it is certainly more orthodox to rifle the works of our own
Divines, than to ransack the treasures of <HI>Romish</HI> priests; and
their inflamed orations are undoubt∣edly less adapted to the genius of our
people, than the sober reasonings of our own preachers. It must be owned
indeed that some of our clergy are greatly want∣ing in that life and
spirit, which would render their instructions more affecting as well as
more pleasing. Their sermons are frequently drawn out in one continued
drawl, without any variation of voice or gesture: so that it is no wonder,
if some of the congregation should be caught napping, when the preacher
himself hardly <PB N="759" REF="334"/> seems to be awake. But though this
drowsy delivery is not to be commended, yet a serious earnestness is
most likely to engage the attention, and convince the reason. This manner,
as it is most decent in itself, is best suited to an <HI>English</HI>
audience; though it is no wonder that a different strain of oratory should
prevail in <HI>France,</HI> since a <HI>Frenchman</HI> accompanies almost
every word in ordinary conversation with some fantastic gesture, and
even enquires concerning your health, and talks of the weather, with a
thousand shrugs and grimaces.</P>
<P>BUT though I do not like to see a preacher lazily lolling on
the cushion, or dozing over his sermon-case, and haranguing his audience
with an unchristian apathy; yet even this unanimated delivery is perhaps
less offensive, than to observe a clergyman less assiduous to
instruct his audience, than to be admired by them. A sober divine should
not ascend the pulpit with the same passions that a public orator
mounts the <HI>rostrum:</HI> much less should he assume the voice,
gesture, and de∣portment of a player, and the language of the theatre. He
should preserve a temperance in the most earnest parts of his
discourse, and go through the whole of it in such a manner, as best
agrees with the solemn place in which it is uttered. Pompous nonsense,
bellowed out with a thundering accent, comes with a worse grace from the
pulpit, than bombast and sustian injudiciously ranted forth by a 
<Q REND="inline">"periwig-pated fellow"</Q> on the stage. I
can∣not better illustrate the absurdity and indecency of this manner, than
by a familiar, though shameful, instance of it. Whoever has occasionally
joined with the butchers in making up the audience of the <HI>Clare-Market</HI>
<PB N="760" REF="335"/> Orator will agree with me, that the impropriety of his
stile and the extravagance of his action become still more shocking and
intolerable by the day which they pro∣phane, and the ecclesiastical
appearance of the place in which the declaimer harangues. Thus while those
who thunder out damnation from parish pulpits, may, from assuming the
manners of the theatre, be resembled to ranting players; the
<HI>Clare-Market</HI> Orator, while he turns religion into farce, must be
considered as exhibiting shews and interludes of an inferior nature, and
himself regarded as a Jack-pudding in a gown and cassock.</P>
<P>A BLOATED stile is perhaps of all others least to be
commended. It is more frequently made a shelter for nonsense, than a
vehicle of truth: but though improper on all occasions, it more especially
deviates from the chaste plainness and simplicity of Pulpit Eloquence.
Nor am I less displeased with those who are admired by some as
<HI>pretty</HI> preachers; as I think a clergyman may be a coxcomb in his
stile and manner, as well as a prig in his appearance. Flowers of rhetoric
injudiciously scattered over a sermon are as disgusting in his
discourse, as the snug wig and scented white handkerchief in his
dress. The <HI>pretty</HI> preacher aims also at politeness and
good-breeding, takes the ladies to task in a genteel vein of raillery, and
handles their modish foibles with the same air that he gallants their fans:
but if he has a mind to put his abili∣ties to the stretch, and indulge
himself in a more than ordinary flow of rhetoric, he fritters away the
solemnity of some scriptural subject; and I have heard a flourishing
declaimer of this cast take off from the awful idea of the Passion by
dwelling principally on the gracefulness of person, sweetness of voice,
and elegance of deportment <PB N="761" REF="336"/> in the Divine Sufferer; and
at another time in speaking of the Fall, I have known him enter into a
picturesque description of the woods, groves, and rivulets, pansies,
pinks, and violets, that threw a perpetual gaiety over the face of nature in
the garden of <HI>Eden.</HI></P>
<P>AFFECTED oratory and an extravagant delivery were first
practised by those who vary from the regular esta∣blished church: nor
is there any manner so unbecoming and indecent, which has not at one time or
another been accounted truly spiritual and graceful. Snuffling through the
nose with an harmonious twang has been regarded as a kind of church-music
best calculated to raise devo∣tion, and a piteous chorus of sighs and
groans has been thought the most effectual call to repentance. Irregular
tremblings of the voice and contortions of the person have long been the
eloquence of Quakers and Presbyterians; and are now the favourite mode of
preaching practised by those self-ordained teachers, who strike out new
lights in religion, and pour forth their extempore rhapsodies in a torrent of
enthusiastical oratory. An inspired cobler will thunder out anathemas,
with the tone and gesture of St. <HI>Paul,</HI> from a joint-stool; and an
enlightened brick∣layer will work himself up to such a pitch of vehemence,
as shall make his audience quake again. I am sorry to see our regular
divines rather copying than reforming this hot and extravagant manner of
preaching; and have with pain been witness to a wild intemperate delivery in
our parish-churches, which I should only have expected at the chapel in
<HI>Long-Acre,</HI> or at the Foundery and Ta∣bernacle in
<HI>Moor-Fields.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="762" REF="337"/>AS a serious earnestness in the
delivery, and a nervous simplicity in the stile of a discourse, are the
most becom∣ing ornaments of the pulpit, so an affectation of elo∣quence is
no where so offensive. The delivery of a preacher as well as his diction
should, like his dress, be plain and decent. Inflamed eloquence and wild
gestures are unsuitable to the place and his function; and though such
vehement heat may perhaps kindle the zeal of a few enthusiastic old beldams
in the isle, it has a very dif∣ferent effect on the more rational part of the
congrega∣tion. I would therefore recommend it to our fashion∣able divines to
aim at being Preachers rather than Orators or Actors, and to endeavour to make
their discourses ap∣pear like Sermons rather than Orations.</P>

<HEAD>To Mr. TOWN.</HEAD>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">W</SEG>E are told, that in <HI>Spain</HI> it is the custom for
husbands never to let their wives go abroad without a watchful old woman to
attend them; and in <HI>Turkey</HI> it is the fashion to lock up their
mistresses under the guard of a trusty eunuch: but I never knew, that
in any country the men were put under the same restrictions. Alas! Sir, my
wife is to me a very <HI>Duena;</HI> she is as careful of me, as the
<HI>Keisler Aga,</HI> or Chief Eunuch, is of the Grand Signior's favourite
Sultana: <PB N="764" REF="339"/> and whether she believes, that I am in love
with every woman, or that every woman is in love with me, she will never
trust me out of her sight; but sticks as close to me, as if she
really was, without a figure, bone of my bone, and flesh of my flesh. I am
never suffered to stir abroad without her, lest I should go astray;
and at home she follows me up and down the house like a child in
leading-strings: nay, if I do but step down stairs on any ordinary
occasion, she is so afraid I shall give her the slip, that she
always screams after me, 
<Q REND="inline">"my dear, you are not going out;"</Q> though
for better security she generally locks up my hat and cane together with
her own gloves and cardinal, that one might not stir out without the
other.</P>
<P>I CANNOT flatter myself, that I am handsomer or better
made than other men: nor has she, in my eyes at least, fewer charms than
other women. Need I add, that my complexion is not over-sanguine, nor my
constitution very robust? Besides, we have not been married above a
month. And yet she is so very doubtful of my con∣stancy, that I cannot
speak, or even pay the compliment of my hat, to any young lady, though in
public, without giving new alarms to her jealousy. Such an one, she is
sure from her flaunting airs, is a kept madam; another is no better than
she should be; and she saw another tip me the wink, or give me a nod,
as a mark of some private assignation between us. A nun, Sir, might as
soon force her way into a convent of monks, as any young woman get admittance
into our house: she has therefore affronted all her acquaintance of her own
sex, that are not, or might not have been, the grandmothers 
<PB N="765" REF="340"/> of many generations; and is at home to nobody, but
maiden ladies in the bloom of threescore, and beauties of the last
century.</P>
<P>SHE will scarce allow me to mix even with persons of my
own sex; and she looks upon batchelors in particular, as no better than
pimps and common seducers. One evening she, indeed, vouchsafed to trust
me out of doors at a tavern with some of my male-friends: but the first
bottle had scarce gone round, before word was brought up, that my boy was
come with the lanthorn to light me home. I sent him back with orders to call
in an hour; when presently after the maid was dispatched, with no∣tice that
my dear was gone to bed very ill, and wanted me directly. I was preparing to
obey the summons; when to our great surprize the sick lady herself
bolted into the room, complained of my cruel heart, and fell into a fit, from
which she did not recover, till the coach had set us down at our own
house. She then called me the ba∣sest of husbands, and said that all
taverns were no better than bawdy-houses, and that men only went thither to
meet naughty women: at last she declared it to be her firm resolution,
that I should never set my foot again in any one of them, except herself
be allowed to make one of the company.</P>
<P>YOU will suppose, Sir, that while my wife is thus cautious
that I should not be led astray when abroad, she takes particular care
that I should not stumble on tempta∣tions at home. For this reason, as
soon as I had brought her to my house, my two maid-servants were
imme∣diately turned away at a moment's warning, not with∣out 
<PB N="766" REF="341"/> out many covert hints and some open accusations of
too near an intimacy between us: though I protest to you one was a feeble old
wrinkled creature, as haggard and frightful as mother <HI>Shipton</HI>; and the
other, a strapping wench, as coarse and brawny as the Female
<HI>Samson.</HI> Even my man <HI>John,</HI> who had lived in the family for
thir∣ty years, was packed off, as being too well acquainted with his master's
sly ways. A chair-woman was forced to do our work for some time, before
madam could suit herself with maids for her purpose. One was too pert an
hussy; another went too fine; another was an impudent forward young
baggage. At present our household is made up of such beautiful
monsters, as <HI>Caliban</HI> himself might fall in love with: my lady's
own waiting-woman has a most inviting hump-back, and is so charmingly
pa∣ralytic, that she shakes all over like a <HI>Chinese</HI> figure; the
house-maid squints most delightfully with one soli∣tary eye, which
weeps continually for the loss of its fel∣low; and the cook, besides a
most captivating red face and protuberant waist, has a most graceful
hobble in her gait, occasioned by one leg being shorter than the other.</P>
<P>I NEED not tell you, that I must never write a letter, but
madam must see the contents before it is done up; and that I never durst
open one till she has broke the seal, or read it till she has first run
it over. Every rap from the post-man at the door makes her tremble; and I
have known her ready to burst with spleen at seeing a superscription
written in a fair <HI>Italian</HI> hand, though perhaps it only comes from my
aunt in the country. She can pick out an intrigue even from the impression
on the wax: and a cupid, or two hearts joined <PB N="767" REF="342"/> in union,
or a wafer pricked with a pin, or stamped with a thimble, she interprets as
the certain tokens of a billet∣doux. The other week I received a letter from
<HI>Derby-shire,</HI> which awakened all her mistrust. She knew from the
scrawl and strange spelling on the outside, that it must come from a
woman: she therefore tore it open in a violent rage, in hopes of making a
most ma∣terial discovery; but to her great disappointment the con∣tents
were perfectly illegible. She was now convinced that it came from some
nasty creature, whom I maintained in the country; and that we corresponded
together in cypher. I was obliged to confess the truth; that it was, indeed,
drawn up in cypher, and that I had the key to it. At length, with much ado, I
explained the whole matter to her; telling her, that it was a letter from my
farmer, who not having been bred at a writing-school expressed his
meaning by characters of his own invention. However, this assurance did not
at all pacify her, till she had dispatched a trusty messenger to be
certified of the truth.</P>
<P>THIS loving creature happened to be taken ill lately, when
she thought that she was going to die. She called me to her bed-side, and
with tears in her eyes told me, that she should not be able to die in
peace, except I would promise her one thing. I assured her, I would
promise any thing to make her easy— 
<Q REND="inline">"O my dear, says she, I cannot bear the
thought of your being another's; and therefore I shall not rest in my
grave, if you do not swear to me, that you will never marry again, or think
of another woman, as long as you <PB N="768" REF="343"/> live."</Q> My poor dear
is, however, recovered, with∣out putting my faith to so hard a trial: though
I may venture to say, that I have already had so much of matrimony, I could
submit to any conditions to part with her.</P>

<HEAD>To Mr. TOWN.</HEAD>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>SIR!</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">M</SEG>Y wife is mad, stark mad; and unless you can prescribe
some remedy for that strange phrenzy that possesses her, my peace
of mind must be for ever broken, and my fortune in∣evitably ruined. You
must know, sir, that she is afflicted with a disorder exactly
opposite to the bite of a <HI>Tarantula:</HI> for as that is said to admit
of no cure but music, there is not a note in the <HI>Gamut,</HI> but what
tends to heighten and inflame my wife's lunacy. I find it is the fashion in
this age for singers and fidlers to publish Appeals to the public:
wherefore, as you have hitherto listened to the complaints of husbands, I
must beg you now to consider <PB N="770" REF="345"/> mine, and to suffer
me also to Appeal to the public by means of your paper.</P>
<P>A FEW years ago business called me over to <HI>Italy</HI>;
where this unfortunate woman received the first, touches of this disorder.
She soon conceived a violent passion for Taste in general, which
settled at last in an unquenchable rage after musical compositions.
Solos, Sonatas, Operas, and Con∣certos, became her sole employment and
delight, and singers and musicians her only company. At length full of
<HI>Italian</HI> airs she returned to <HI>England,</HI> where also her
whole happiness has been centered in the orchestra, and it has been her
whole pride to be thought a <HI>Connoisseur</HI> in music. If there is an
opera, oratorio, or concert, to be performed within the bills of mortality, I
do not believe that the riches of the <HI>Indies</HI> could prevail on her to
be absent. Two, and only two good consequences attend this madness, and
those are, that she constantly attends St. <HI>James</HI>'s chapel for
the sake of the anthem and the rest of the music: and out of the many
pounds idly squandered on minums and semi∣quavers, some few are dedicated
to charities, which are pro∣moted by musical performances.</P>
<P>BUT what makes this rage after catgut more irksome and
intolerable to me is, that I have not myself the least idea of what they
call Taste, and it almost drives me mad to be pestered with it. I am a
plain man, and have not the least spice of a <HI>Connoisseur</HI> in my
composition, yet nothing will satisfy my wife unless I appear as fond of
such nonsense as herself. About a month ago she prevailed on me to
attend her to the Opera, where every dying fall made her expire, as well as
Lady <HI>Townly.</HI> She was ravished with one air, in <PB N="771" REF="346"/> extasies at another, applauded <HI>Ricciarelli,</HI> encored
<HI>Mingotti,</HI> and in short acted like an absolute madwoman; while the
performance and her behaviour had a quite different effect upon me, who sat
dumb with confusion, 
<Q REND="inline">"most musical, most melancholy,"</Q> at
her elbow. When we came home again, she seemed as happy as harmony could
make her, but I must own, that I was all discord, and most heartily vexed
at being made a fool in public. 
<Q REND="inline">"Well, my dear, said she, how do you like
the opera?"—</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">"Zouns, madam, I would as soon be dragged
through a horsepond, as go to an opera with you again."—</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">"O fie! but you must be delighted with
<HI>The Mingotti.</HI>"—</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">"The Mingotti! <HI>The Devil.</HI>"—</Q>

<Q REND="inline">"Well, I am sorry for it, Sir
<HI>Aaron,</HI> but I find you have no Ear."—</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">"Ear, madam? I had rather cut off my ears,
than suffer them to make me an ideot."</Q> To this she made me no reply,
but began a favourite opera tune, and after taking a tour round the room like
one of the singers, left me alone.</P>
<P>IF my wife could be satisfied, like other musical ladies,
with attending public performances, and now and then thrumming on her
harpsicord the tunes she hears there; I should be content. But she has
also a concert of her own constantly once a week. Here she is in still
greater raptures than at the opera, as all the music is chosen and
appointed by herself. The expence of this whim is monstrous, for not one of
these people will open their mouths, or rosin a single string, without
being very well paid for it. Then she must have all the best hands and
voices, and has almost as large a set of performers in pay as the manager
of the opera. It puts me quite out of patience to see these fellows
strutting about my house drest up like lords and gentlemen. Not a 
<PB N="772" REF="347"/> single fiddler or singer but what appears in lace or
embroidery, and I once mistook my wife's chief musi∣cian for a foreign
ambassador.</P>
<P>IT is impossible to recount the numberless follies to
which this ridiculous passion for Music exposes her. Her devotion to
the art, makes her almost adore the professors of it. A musician is a
greater man in her eye than a duke, and she would sooner oblige an
opera-singer than a countess. She is as busy in promoting their benefits
as if she was to have the receipts of the house; and quarrels with all her
ac∣quaintance, who will not permit her to load them with tick∣ets. Every fidler
in town makes it his business to scrape an acquaintance with her, and an
<HI>Italian</HI> is no sooner imported than she becomes a part of my wife's
band of performers. In the late Opera disputes she has been a most
furious parti∣zan, and it is impossible for any patriot to feel more
anxiety for the danger of <HI>Blakeney</HI> and <HI>Minorca,</HI> than she
has suffered on account of the Opera, and the loss of
<HI>Mingotti.</HI></P>
<P>I DO not believe my wife has a single idea except
recita∣tive, airs, counter-tenor, thorough-bass, &amp;c. which are
perpetually singing in her head. When we sit together, instead of joining
in any agreeable conversation, she is always either humming a tune, or 
<Q REND="inline">"discoursing most eloquent music."</Q>
Nature has denied her a voice, but as <HI>Italy</HI> has given her Taste and
a graceful manner, she is continually squeaking out strains less
melodious, than the harmony of ballad-singing in our streets, or
psalm-singing in a country church. To make her still more ridiculous,
she learns to play on that masculine instrument the bass-viol; the
pleasure of which nothing can prevail on her to forego, as the 
<PB N="773" REF="348"/> bass-viol, she daily tells me, contains the whole
power and very soul of harmony.</P>
<P>WHAT method, Mr. TOWN, shall I persue to cure my wife of
this musical phrenzy? I have some thoughts of holding weekly a burlesque
<HI>Rorotorio,</HI> composed of mock-airs with grand accompanyments of the
Jew's Harp, Wooden Spoons, and Marrowbones and Cleavers on the same day with
my wife's concert; and have actually sent to two of Mrs. <HI>Midnight</HI>'s
hands to teach me the art and mystery of playing on the Broomstick and
Hurdy-Gurdy, at the same time that my wife learns on the bass-viol. I have
also a strong rough voice, which will enable me to roar out <HI>Bumper</HI>
Squire Jones, <HI>Roast Beef,</HI> or some other old <HI>English</HI>
ballad, whenever she begins to trill forth her melodious airs in
<HI>Italian.</HI> If this has no effect, I will learn to beat the drum, or wind
the post-horn: and if I should still find it impossible for noise
and clamour to overcome the sound of her voices and instruments, I have
half-resolved peremptorily to shut my doors against singers and
fidlers, and even to demolish her harpsichord and bass-viol.</P>
<P>BUT this, alas! is coming to extremities, which I am almost
afraid to venture, and would endeavour to avoid. I have no aversion to
music, but I would not be a fidler: nor do I dislike company, but I would
as soon keep an inn, as convert my house into a theatre for all the idle
things of both sexes to assemble at. But my wife's affections are so
wedded to the <HI>Gamut,</HI> that I cannot devise any means to wean her from
this folly. If I could make her fond of dress, or teach her to love cards,
plays, or any thing but music I should be happy. This method of
destroying <PB N="774" REF="349"/> my peace with harmony, is no better than
tickling me to death; and to squander away such sums of money on a parcel
of bawling scraping rascals in laced coats and bag-wigs, is absolutely
giving away my estate for an old song. You, Mr. TOWN, are a professed
<HI>Connoisseur,</HI> therefore either give me a little Taste, or teach
my wife to abandon it: for at present we are but a jangling pair, and there
is not the least harmony between us, though, like bass and treble, we are
obliged to join in concert.</P>

<OPENER>
<SALUTE>SIR!</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> AM a rich old bachelor, and like other an∣tient gentlemen
of that order, and very fond of being indulged in all my odd humours, and
always having my own way. This is one reason I never married, for if my wife
had been a shrewish termagant, she would have killed me, and if she had
been a tame domestic animal I should have killed her: but the way of life I
have now fallen into is of all others the best calculated to gratify my
fantastical temper. I have no near relation indeed to treat as an humble
cousin all my life, in hopes of being happy at my death; yet I abound in
sycophants and followers, all whom I delude, <PB N="776" REF="351"/> like
another <HI>Volpone,</HI> with the expectations of being made my heir. The
abject spirit of these wretches flatters me, and amuses me. I am indolent
and hate contradiction, and can safely say that not one of my acquaintance
has contra∣dicted me for these seven years. There is not one of them but
would be glad if I would spit in his face, or rejoice at a kick of the breech
from me, if they thought I meant it as a token of my familiarity. When I am
grave, they appear as dull as mutes at a funeral; when I smile, they grin
like monkies; when I tell a silly story, they chuckle over every ridiculous
particular, and shake their sides in admiration of my wit. Sometimes I
pretend to be short-sighted, and then not one of them sees farther than
his nose. They swallow sour wine, eat musty victuals, and are proud to
ride in my old boots.</P>
<P>I HAVE been told of a certain prelate, who brought his
chaplains to such a degree of servility, that after every deal at whist,
they would ask him, what he would chuse to have for trumps next deal? I
keep my fellows in equal good order. They all think me a close old hunks, and
imagining that winning their money will put me in good humour with them, they
practice all the arts of sharping to cheat them∣selves. I have known them
pack the cards at Whist, that I might hold all the four honours in my own
hand; they will load the dice in my favour at Hazard; pocket themselves on
purpose at Billiards; and at Bowls if any one is near win∣ning the game, he
never fails in the next cast to mistake his biass. It is impossible
for the most despotic monarch to be more absolute over his subjects,
than I am over these slaves and sycophants. Yet in spite of all their
endeavours to oblige me, I most heartily despise them, and have al∣ready 
<PB N="777" REF="352"/> drawn up a will, in which I have bequeathed to each of
them a shilling and a dog-collar.</P>
<P>BUT though I have settled in my mind what legacies I shall
leave them, I have not thoroughly resolved in what manner I shall
dispose of the bulk of my estate. Indeed I am fully determined, like
most other wealthy bachelors, either to leave my fortune to some
ostentatious pious uses, or to persons, whom I have never seen, and for
whose cha∣racters I have not the least regard or esteem. To speak
sin∣cerely, ostentation carries away my whole heart: but then it is a
little difficult to find out a new object to indulge my va∣nity, whilst I am
on this side the grave; by securing to me a certain prospect of
posthumous fame, which is always so agreeable to living pride.</P>
<P>THE hospitals are so numerous that my name will be lost
among those more known and established of <HI>Guy, Morden, Bancroft,</HI>
and I know not who. Besides in the space of four or five centuries perhaps
it may be thought, notwithstanding my whole length picture and statue, that
I had assistance from parliament. If I order my money to be laid out in
churches, they will never be built. If in temple, gardens, lakes, obelisks,
and serpentine rivers; the next generation of the sons of Taste will
demolish all my works, turn my rounds into squares, and my squares into
rounds, and not leave even my bust, although it were cast a plaister of
<HI>Paris</HI> by Mr. <HI>Racstrow,</HI> or worked up in wax by Mr.
<HI>Goupy.</HI> Or supposing in imitation of some of my predecessors,
I were to bequeath my fortune to my housekeeper, and recommend her in my will
as a pattern of virtue, diligence, and every good quality, what will be the
effect? In three weeks <PB N="778" REF="353"/> after my death she will marry
an <HI>Irishman,</HI> and I shall not even enjoy my monument and marble
perriwig in <HI>Westminster-Abby.</HI></P>
<P>NOTHING perplexes me so much as the disposal of my money
by my last will and testament. While I am living, it procures the most
servile compliance with all my whims from my sycophants, and several
other conveniences: but I would fain buy fame with it after my death. Do but
in∣struct me, how I may lay it out in the most valuable pur∣chases of
this sort, only discover some new object of charity, and perhaps I may
bequeath you a round sum of money for your advice.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>I am, SIR, Your humble Servant, THOMAS
VAINALL.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>IT is said by an old poet, that no man's life can be called
happy or unhappy till his death: in like manner I have often thought that no
words or actions are a better comment on a person's temper and
disposition, than his last will and testament. This is a true
portraiture of himself drawn at full length by his own hand, in which the
painting is com∣monly very lively, and the features very strongly marked. In
the discharge of this solemn act, people sign and seal themselves,
either wise and good characters, or villains and sools: and any person
that makes a ridiculous will, and be∣queaths his money to frivolous uses,
only takes a great deal of pains, like <HI>Dogberry</HI> in the play, 
<Q REND="inline">"that he may be set down and ass."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="779" REF="354"/>THE love of fame governs our actions more
universally than any other passion. All the rest gradually drop off,
but this runs through our whole lives. This perhaps is one of the chief
inducements that influences wealthy per∣sons to bequeath their
possessions to ostentatious uses, and they would as willingly lay
out a considerable sum in buying a great name (if possible) at their
deaths, as they would bestow it on the purchase of a coat of heraldry
during their lives. They are pleased with leaving some memorial of their
existence behind them, and to perpetuate the remembrance of themselves by
the application of their money of some vain-glorious purposes; though the
good gentlemen never did one act to make themselves remarkable, laid out a
single shilling in a laudable manner, while they lived. If an
<HI>Apotheosis</HI> were to be bought, how many rich scoundrels would be
deified after their deaths! not a plumb in the city but would purchase this
imaginary godship, as readily as he paid for his freedom at his first
setting up; and I doubt not but this fantastical distinction would be
more frequent on an escutcheon, than a coronet.</P>
<P>THE disposal of our fortunes by our last will should be
considered as the discharge of a sacred trust, which we should
endeavour to execute in a just manner; and as we have had the enjoyment of
rich possessions, we ought care∣fully to provide that they may devolve
to those, who have the most natural claim to them. They who may first
de∣mand our favour, are those who are allied to us by the ties of blood: next
to these stand those persons to whom we are connected by friendship:
and next to our friends and rela∣tions, mankind in general. But the humanity of
a tes∣tator will not be thought very extensive, though it reaches 
<PB N="780" REF="355"/> to posterity, or includes the poor in general, if it
neg∣lects the objects of charity immediately under his eye, or those
individuals who have the best title to his benevolence. <HI>Virgil</HI> has
placed those rich men, who bestowed none of their wealth on their
relations, among the chief personages in his Hell. Wherefore I would advise
my good correspondent Mr. <HI>Vainall</HI> first to consider, whether he
has not some poor relation, starving perhaps in some distant part of
the king∣dom: after that let him look round, whether he has not some friends,
whom he may possibly relieve from misery and distress. But if he has
no relation, nor no person in the world that has any regard for him, before
he begins to en∣dow a college or found an hospital, I should take it as a
par∣ticular favour if he would leave his money to me, and will promise to
immortalize his memory in the <HI>Connoisseur.</HI></P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> HAVE just received the following let∣ter from lady
<HI>Humkin,</HI> the musical con∣sort of my late correspondent Sir
<HI>Aaron.</HI> I shall not pretend to moderate in family disputes of so
important a nature, but leave each party to speak for themselves.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>Mr. TOWN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">P</SEG>RAY hear both sides fairly, before you judge; for (to
use a vulgar expression) one story is good, till the other is told. I
am, sir, the unfortunate wife of that <PB N="782" REF="357"/> inelegant (I had
almost said insensible) husband, who in your paper of the eighth
instant pronounces and pub∣lishes me to be mad, stark mad.</P>
<P>I CONFESS and glory in my passion for music: and can
there be a nobler or a more generous one? My nerves are naturally strung to
harmony, and variously affected by the various combinations of the
<HI>Gamut.</HI> Some stay in <HI>Italy</HI> added skill and taste in
composition to my natural happy disposition to music; and the best
judges, as well as the best performers in that country, allowed me to have an
uncommon share of <HI>virtù.</HI> I both compose and per∣form,
sir: and though I say it, perhaps few even of the profession
possess the <HI>contra-punto</HI> and the <HI>cromatic</HI> bet∣ter; and
I have had the unspeakable pleasure, of hearing my compositions and my
performances dignified in <HI>Italy</HI> with the unanimous appellations of
<HI>squisito, divino,</HI> and <HI>adorevole.</HI></P>
<P>IS there any madness in this? Does not he better de∣serve
that imputation, whose breast is insensible and im∣penetrable to all
charms and powers of harmony? To be plain, I mean my husband; whom I have
frequently seen yawn, nay leave the room, in the middle of the most
touching pathetic, sung by the most affecting <HI>Sig∣nora Mingotti,</HI>
accompanied by the divine <HI>Signor di Giar∣dino.</HI> And yet,—pardon
this digressive transport,—how irresistible is the
expression, the melody, the cadences, the <HI>appogyraturas</HI> of that
incomparable <HI>virtuosa!</HI> What energy, what delicacy, and what variety
are in the in∣imitable <PB N="783" REF="358"/> compositions and execution of
the charming <HI>Sig∣nor di Giardino!</HI> What an <HI>arpeggio</HI> he has,
what a <HI>stacca∣to,</HI> what an <HI>andante!</HI> In short, I may I am
sure with truth assert, that whether in the <HI>allegro</HI> or the
<HI>piano,</HI> the <HI>adagio,</HI> the <HI>largo,</HI> or the <HI>forte,</HI>
he never had his equal. O, Mr. TOWN, what an irretrievable loss has this
coun∣try sustained! My good man, among his other qualifi∣cations, is a
politician, you must know; and one of his principal objections against
these <HI>virtuosi</HI> is, that they are foreigners. He flew into a
violent passion with me last <HI>Sunday</HI> night, because I had a
concert at my house, when (he said) such bad news were received from
abroad. I know not what he, and other muddy-headed politicians may think: but
let him talk what he will of THE <HI>Blakeney,</HI> THE Governor, THE Admiral,
I am sure the nation cannot sustain a greater evil than the loss of THE
<HI>Mingotti;</HI> who, as the public prints will inform you, 
<Q REND="inline">"is gone to <HI>Holland,</HI> till her affairs
in <HI>England</HI> can be settled."</Q></P>
<P>BUT however gothic my husband may be, I am fully determined
to discharge the duty of a good wife. Ac∣cordingly, whenever he comes into my
room, I sit down to my harpsichord, and sing and play the most
soothing pieces of music, in hopes some time or other of hitting his
unison, but hitherto to no purpose; and, to say the truth, I fear he has
not one harmonic nerve in his whole system, though otherwise a man of
good plain sense. When he interrupts my performances, (as in his letter he
owns that he does) with wishing for the men from <PB N="784" REF="359"/>
<HI>Mother Midnight's,</HI> with their wooden spoons, salt-boxes,
jews-harps, and broom-sticks, to play in concert with me; I answer him with
all gentleness and calmness ima∣ginable.— 
<Q REND="inline">"Indeed, my dear, you have not the least
no∣tion of these things. It would be impossible to bring those
ridiculous instruments into a concert, and to adapt a thorough bass to
them: they have not above three notes at most, and those cannot be
<HI>softenute.</HI>"</Q>—I wish 
<Q REND="inline">"for all that, answers he, that they were
here; I should like them better than all your <HI>Signors</HI> and
<HI>Signoras</HI>; and I am sure they would cost a great deal
less."</Q></P>
<P>THIS article of <HI>expence</HI> he often dwells upon, and
sometimes even with warmth; to which I reply with all the mildness that
becomes a good wife, 
<Q REND="inline">"My dear, you have a good fortune of your own,
and I brought you still a better. Of what use is money, if not em∣ployed?
and how can it be better employed, than in encouraging and rewarding
distinguished <HI>gusto</HI> and merit? These people, that you call
ballad-singers and pipers, are people of birth, though for the most part of
small fortunes; and they are much more consi∣dered, as you know, in
<HI>Italy,</HI> than all the greatest antient <HI>Roman</HI> heroes, if
revived, would now be. Many of them, who would perhaps make a figure in the
church or the state, have been considerable losers by devoting
themselves to the pleasures of mankind. They leave their own country, where
they are infinitely esteemed for their moral as well as their musical
characters, and generously sacrifice all <PB N="785" REF="360"/> these
advantages to our diversion. Besides, my dear, what should we do wish
our money? would you lavish it away, upon foundling bastards, lying-in
women who have either no husbands or too many, importunate beggars, all
whose cries and complaints are the most shocking discords? or
suppose that we were to save our money, and leave our children better
fortunes, who knows but they might, as too many do, squander them away idly?
whereas what we give to these <HI>virtuosi,</HI> we know is given to merit.
For my own part, my dear, I have infinite pleasure, when I can get any of
them to accept of fifty or an hundred guineas, which by the way cannot always
be brought about without some art and contri∣vance; for they are most
exceedingly nice and de∣licate upon the point of honour, especially in the
article of money. And I look upon such trifling presents as a debt due to
superior talents and merit; and I endeavour to insinuate them in a way that
the receiver may not blush."</Q> —Here my husband breaks out into a
violent passion, and says,— 
<Q REND="inline">"Oons, madam, show me a <HI>virtuoso</HI>
or a <HI>virtuosa,</HI> (as you call them) who ever blushed in their lives,
and I will give them the fee simple of my estate."</Q> You see, Mr. TOWN,
what a strange man he is, that he has no idea of elegance and
<HI>divertimenti,</HI> and when he is so violently in <HI>alt,</HI> I will
leave you to judge who it is that is mad, stark mad.</P>
<P>IN short, sir, my husband is insensible, untuneable,
to the most noble, generous, and strongest of all hu∣man 
<PB N="786" REF="361"/> passions, a passion for music. That divine
passion alone engrosses the whole soul, and leaves no room for
lesser and vulgar cares; for you must certainly have ob∣served, Mr.
TOWN, that whoever has a passion for, and a thorough knowledge of music,
is fit for no one other thing. Thus truly informed of my case, I am sure
you will judge equitably between Sir <HI>Aaron</HI> and</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Your faithful humble servant, MARIA
HUMKIN.</SIGNED></CLOSER>

<DIV2 TYPE="body of issue">
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">N</SEG>O other disposition or turn of mind so totally unfits a
man for all the social offices of life as Indolence. An idle man is a mere
blank in the creation, he seems made for no end, and lives to no purpose.
He can∣not engage himself in any employment or profession, be∣cause he
will never have diligence enough to follow it; he can succeed in no
undertaking, for he will never persue it; he must be a bad husband,
father, and relation, for he will not take the least pains to preserve his
wife, children, and family from starving; and he must be a worthless
friend, for he would not draw his hand from his bosom, though to 
<PB N="788" REF="363"/> prevent the destruction of the universe. If he is
born poor, he will remain so all his life, which he will probably end in a
ditch or at the gallows; if he embarks in trade he will be a bankrupt; and if
he is a person of fortune, he stew∣ards will acquire immense estates,
and he himself perhaps will die in the <HI>Fleet.</HI></P>
<P>IT should be considered that nature did not bring us into
the world in a state of perfection, but has left us in a capacity of
improvement: which should seem to intimate that we should labour to
render ourselves excellent. Very few are such absolute ideots, as not to
be able to become at least decent, if not eminent, in their several
stations, by unwearied and keen application: nor are there any possest
of such transcendant genius and abilities, as to render all pains and
diligence unnecessary. Perseverance will over∣come difficulties, which at
first appear insuperable; and it is amazing to consider, how great and
numerous obstacles may be removed by a continual attention to any particular
point. I will not mention here the trite example of <HI>De∣mosthenes,</HI>
who got over the greatest natural impediments to oratory, but content
myself with a more modern and fami∣liar instance. Being at <HI>Sadler's
Wells</HI> a few nights ago, I could not but admire the surprizing feats of
activity there exhibited, and at the same time reflected what incredible
pains and labour it must have cost the performers, to ar∣rive at the art of
writhing their bodies into such various and unnatural contortions. But I was
most taken with the ingenious artist, who after fixing two bells to each
foot, the same number to each hand, and with great propriety placing a cap
and bells on his head, played several tunes, and went through as regular
triple peals <PB N="789" REF="364"/> and <HI>Bob Majors</HI> as the boys at
<HI>Christ Church</HI> Hospital; all which he effected by the due jerking
of his arms and legs, and nodding his head backward and forward. If this
artist had taken equal pains to employ his head in another way, he might
perhaps have been as deep a proficient in numbers as <HI>Jedediah Buxton,</HI>
or at least a tolerable modern rhimer, of which he is now no bad emblem: and
if our fine ladies would use equal diligence, they might fashion their
minds as successfully as Madam <HI>Catharina</HI> distorts her body.</P>
<P>THERE is not in the world a more useless idle animal, than
he who contents himself with being merely a Gentle∣man. He has an estate,
therefore he will not endeavour to acquire knowledge: he is not to labour in
any vocation, therefore he will do nothing. But the misfortune is that there is
no such thing in nature as negative virtue, and that absolute idleness is
impracticable. He who does no good, will certainly do mischief; and the mind,
if it is not stored with useful knowledge, will necessarily become a
magazine of nonsense and trifles. Wherefore a Gentleman, though he is not
obliged to rise to open his shop or work at his trade, may always find
some ways of employing his time to advantage. If he makes no advances in
wisdom, he will become more and more a slave to folly; and he that does
nothing because he has nothing to do, will become vicious and abandoned, or
at best ridiculous and contemptible.</P>
<P>THERE is not a more melancholy object, than a man of an honest
heart and fine natural abilities whose good quali∣ties are thus destroyed
by Indolence. Such a person is a constant plague to all his friends and
acquaintance, with all the means in his power of adding to their happiness;
and <PB N="790" REF="365"/> suffers himself to rank among the lowest
characters, when he might render himself conspicuous among the highest.
Nobody is more universally beloved, and more universally avoided than my
friend <HI>Careless.</HI> He is a humane man, who never did a beneficent
action; and a man of unshaken integrity, on whom it is impossible to
depend. With the best head, and the best heart, he regulates his conduct in
the most absurd manner, and frequently injures his friends; for whoever
neglects to do justice to himself, must in∣evitably wrong those with
whom he is connected; and it is by no means a true maxim, that an idle man
hurts nobody but himself.</P>
<P>VIRTUE then is not to be considered in the light of mere
innocence, or abstaining from harm, but as the exertion of our faculties in
doing good: as <HI>Titus,</HI> when he had let a day slip,
undistinguished by some act of virtue, cried out, 
<Q REND="inline">"I have lost a day."</Q> If we regard our time
in this light, how many days shall we look back upon as irretrievably lost?
and to how narrow a compass would such a method of cal∣culation frequently
reduce the longest life? If we were to number our days, according as we have
applied them to virtue, it would occasion strange revolutions in the manner
of reckoning the ages of men. We should see some few men arrived to a
good old age in the prime of their youth, and meet with several young fellows
of fourscore.</P>
<P>AGREEABLE to this way of thinking, I remember to have met with
the epitaph of an aged man, four years old: dating his existence, from the
time of his reformation from evil courses. The inscriptions on most
tomb-stones commemo∣rate no acts of virtue performed by the persons who lie
under <PB N="791" REF="366"/> them, but only record that they were born one day
and died another. But I would fain have those people, whose lives have been
useless, rendered of some service after their deaths, by affording
lessons of instruction and morality to those they leave behind them.
Wherefore I could wish, that in every parish several acres were marked
out for a new and spacious Burying-Ground: in which every person, whose
remains are there deposited, should have a small stone laid over them,
reckon∣ing their age according to the manner in which they have improved or
abused the time allotted them in their lives. In such circumstances, the
plate on a coffin might be the high∣est panegyric which the deceased could
receive; and a lit∣tle square stone, inscribed with <HI>Ob. Ann.
Aetat.</HI> 80. would be a nobler eulogium than all the lapidary adulation of
mo∣dern epitaphs. In a Burying-Ground of this nature, allow∣ing for the
partiality of survivors, which would certainly point out the most brilliant
actions of their dead friends, we might perhaps see some inscriptions,
not much unlike the following.</P>
<Q>Here lie the remains of a celebrated Beauty, aged 50, who died
in the fifth year of her age. She was born in her eighteenth year, and was
untimely killed by the small pox in her twenty third.</Q>
<Q> Here rests in eternal sleep the mortal part of L.
<HI>B.</HI> a Free∣thinker, aged 88, an Infant. He came into the world by
chance in the year — and was <HI>annihilated</HI> in the first year of
his age.</Q>
<Q> Here continue to rot the bones of a noted Buck, an em∣bryo, who
never shewed any signs of life, and after twenty <PB N="792" REF="367"/>
three years was so totally putrified, that it could not be kept above ground
any longer.</Q>
<Q> Here lies the swoln carcase of a Boon Companion, who was
born in a dropsy in the 40th year of his age: He lin∣gered in this condition,
till he was obliged to be tapped, when he relapsed into his former condition,
and died in the second year of his age, and the 23d of his drinking.</Q>
<Q> Here lies <HI>Isaac Da-Costa,</HI> a convert from
Judaism, aged 64. He was born and christened in his 61st year, and died
in the true Faith in the third year of his age.</Q>
<Q> Here is deposited the body of the celebrated Beau
<HI>Tawdry,</HI> who was born at court in the year — on a
<HI>Birthnight,</HI> and died of grief in his second year upon the court's
going into mourning.</Q>
<Q> Here rots A. <HI>B. Still</HI>-born, who died of a fright on
the twentieth of May, 1756.</Q>
<Q> Here rests from his labours the Brave General <HI>B.</HI> who
died about the hundredth year of his age, older than <HI>Methuselah.</HI></Q>

<DIV2 TYPE="body of issue">
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> KNOW not any greater misfortune that can happen to a young
fellow at his first setting out in life, than his falling into Low Company.
He that sinks to a familiarity with persons much below his own level, will
be constantly weighed down by his base connections: and though he may
easily plunge still lower, he will find it impossible ever to rise
again. We cannot give a liberal <PB N="794" REF="369"/> turn of mind to a vulgar
by introducing him to genteel company, any more than we can make a beau of him
by dressing him in embroidery: but a gentlemen will as na∣turally catch the
manners of a blackguard by mixing with blackguards, as he would daub his
cloaths with foot by running against a chimney-sweeper.</P>
<P>BY Low Company I would not be supposed to mean the best
and most valuable part of mankind, which have been distinguished by the
name of Middling sort of people: though I am not ignorant, that these are
despised by all, who would be thought to keep the Best Company. The apes
of quality affect to look upon all others, who have no relish for the
amusements of high life, or do not chuse to pay a guinea for their
ordinary, as downright vulgars: and it was with the utmost contempt I once
heard a young coxcomb of fashion speak of a most inti∣mate friend, 
<Q REND="inline">"that he should be forced to drop his
ac∣quaintance, because he kept such low company."</Q> Nei∣ther would I
confine this appellation solely to the inferior order of tradesmen and
mechanics, or the whole body of the mobility in general: for although this rank
of people may be literally said to be in low life, a right honourable, who
lets himself down to the manners of a porter or a hackney-coachman, differs
from them in nothing but his title.</P>
<P>A PROPENSITY to Low Company is either owing to an original
meanness of spirit, a want of education, or <PB N="795" REF="370"/> an
ill-placed pride, commonly arising from both the fore-mentioned causes.
Those, who are naturally of a grovelling disposition, shew it even at
school, by chusing their play-mates from the scum of the class; and are
never so happy, as when they can steal down to romp with the servants in
the kitchen. But the most frequent cause is the desire of being, as it is
called, the head of the company; and a person of this humble ambition will be
very well content to pay the reckoning, for the honour of being
distinguished by the title of The Gentle∣man. It sometimes happens, that
a man of genius and learning will stoop to receive the incense of mean and
illiterate flatterers in a porter-house or a cyder-cellar: and I remember to
have heard of a poet, who was once caught in a bawdy-house in the very fact,
of reading his verses to the good old mother and a circle of her
daughters.</P>
<P>THERE are some, who have been led into Low Company, merely
from an affectation of Humour; and from a notion of seeing life, and a
desire of being ac∣counted men of humour, have descended to associate
with the meanest of the mob, and picked their cronies from
<HI>White-Chapel</HI> and <HI>Broad St. Giles</HI>'s. Of these cha∣racters
the most remarkable is a young fellow of family and fortune, who was born and
bred a gentleman, but has taken great pains to degrade himself; and is now as
complete a blackguard as those whom he has chosen for his companions. He
will drink purl in a <PB N="796" REF="371"/> morning, smoke his pipe in a
night-cellar, and eat black puddings at <HI>Bartholomew Fair,</HI> for the
Humour of the thing. All the while, he is reckoned by his friends to be a
mighty good-natured gentleman, and without the least bit of pride in him.</P>
<P>IN order to qualify himself for the society of the vulgar,
<HI>Bob</HI> has studied and practised all the vulgar arts under the best
masters. He has therefore cultivated an intimacy with <HI>Buckhorse,</HI>
and is very proud of being sometimes admitted to the honour of conversing
with the great <HI>Broughton</HI> himself. He is also very well known among
the hackney-coachmen, as a brother∣whip: but his greatest excellence is
cricket-playing, in which he is reckoned as good a bat as either of the
<HI>Bennets</HI>; and is at length arrived at the supreme dig∣nity of being
distinguished among his brethren of the wicket by the title of <HI>Long
Robin.</HI></P>
<P>IT is diverting enough to consider the fate of many of
<HI>Bob</HI>'s intimate friends and acquaintance. It must be owned, that
some of these have come to an untimely end; that some have been sent
abroad, and others been set in the pillory, or whipt in <HI>Bridewell.</HI>
One of <HI>Bob</HI>'s favourite amusements is attending the executions at
<HI>Tyburn:</HI> and it once happened, that one of his com∣panions was
unfortunately brought thither; when <HI>Bob</HI> carried his regard for his
deceased friend so far, as to <PB N="797" REF="372"/> get himself knocked
down in endeavouring to rescue the body from the surgeons.</P>
<P>As <HI>Bob</HI> constantly affects to mimic the air and
man∣ners of the vulgar, he takes care to enrich his conver∣sation with the
emphatical oaths and expressive dialect of <HI>Billingsgate</HI> and
<HI>St. Giles</HI>'s; which never fails to re∣commend him as a man of excellent
humour among the <HI>Choice Spirits</HI> and the <HI>Sons of sound sense
and satis∣faction,</HI> and frequently promotes him to the chair in these
facetious societies. But he is particularly famous for singing those
<HI>Cant Songs,</HI> drawn up in the lingo of sharpers and pick-pockets; the
humour of which he greatly sets off and heightens, by screwing up his
mouth, and rolling about a large quid of tobacco be∣tween his jaws.</P>
<P><HI>BOB</HI> has indulged the same notions of humour even in
his amours: and he is well known to every street-walker between
<HI>Charing-Cross</HI> and <HI>Cheap-Side.</HI> This has ruined his
constitution, and often involved him in several unluckly scrapes. He has
been fre∣quently bruised, beat, and kicked by the bullies in
<HI>Fleet-Ditch</HI> and <HI>Blood-Bowl Alley</HI>; and he was once soundly
drubbed by a soldier for engaging with his trull in St. <HI>James</HI>'s
Park. The last time I saw him, he was laid up with two black eyes, and a
broken pate, which he got in a midnight skirmish about a mistress in a
night-cellar. He had carried down a <PB N="798" REF="373"/> bunter which he had
picked up in the streets, in order to treat her with a quartern of gin royal;
when a sturdy chairman attempting to take away his doxy, a battle ensued
between them, and he was severely handled, amid the universal cry of the
whole company, of—kick him <HI>up</HI> stairs—kick him
<HI>up</HI> stairs.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR!</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>F we look into the several inns of court, the profest
students of the law compose a very numerous body: but if we afterwards turn
our eyes on those few, who are employed in exercising their talents in
<HI>Westminster-Hall,</HI> this prodigious army of lawyers shrinks to a
very thin and inconsiderable corps. Thousands, it seems, are
disgusted with the unpleasing dryness of the study, as it is now
ma∣naged, and conceive an unconquerable aversion to the white 
<PB N="800" REF="375"/> leaves and the old black letter. This early dislike to
legal enquiries certainly proceeds from the fatal mistakes in the plan of
study hitherto marked out. According to all systems now extant, it is
absolutely impossible to be at once a lawyer and a fine gentleman. Seeing
with concern the many evils arising from these erroneous principles, I have
at length devised a method to remedy all these inconveniences; a method,
now very successfully practised by several young gentlemen. Wherefore I
must beg leave to submit my thoughts to the public by means of your paper,
and to chalk out the out∣lines of a treatise, now ready for the press,
intitled <HI>The Com∣plete Barrister,</HI> or, <HI>a New Institute of the
Laws of England.</HI></P>
<P>MY Lord <HI>Coke</HI> prescribes to our student to follow
the ad∣vice given in the ancient verses, prefixed to this letter, for the
good spending of the day. 
<Q REND="inline">"Six hours to sleep, six to the study of
the law, four to prayer, two to meals, and the rest to the Muses."</Q> But
what an absurd and un∣fashionable distribution of the four and twenty
hours! I will venture a thousand pounds to a shilling, that not one
student in the kingdom divides his time in this manner. Here is not a
single word of <HI>Vauxhall, Ranelagh,</HI> the theatres, or other public
diversions; not to mention that nobody but a methodist would ever think of
praying four hours, and that it would be impossible, though we were content
with snap∣ping up a chop every day at <HI>Betty</HI>'s, to dispatch even
dinner in two. How then shall we reconcile these precepts, scarce
practicable by a hermit, to the life of a young gentleman who keeps the best
company? Or how can these rules for severe application be made
consistent with the practice of those, who divide their whole time
between eating, drink∣ing, sleeping, and amusements? Well knowing that the 
<PB N="801" REF="376"/> volatile dispositions of the young gentlemen of the
present age can never submit the ordering of their lives to any
pre∣scribed rules, I have endeavoured to square my precepts to their lives;
and have so contrived the matter, that amidst the keenest persuit of
their pleasures, they shall be engaged in the most improving course of
the law.</P>
<P>AS laws are chiefly nothing else but rules of action, what
can be more cruel and absurd, than to coop up a brisk young man to learn in
his chambers, what he can so much better teach himself by going abroad into
the world? I propose to dose gentlemen with study, as Dr. <HI>Rock</HI>
does with physic, to be taken at home or abroad without loss of time or
hindrance of business. This, I am convinced, is not only the best
me∣thod, but also the only scheme which several inhabitants of the inns
of court would ever follow. I shall not at present forestall the contents
of my treatise by presenting you with a dry abstract of it, but rather
endeavour to give you an idea of the spirit and manner in which it is
written, by delineating the plan diligently persued by one of my favourite
pupils: and I cannot but congratulate the bar, that so many young men,
instead of blinding their eyes and bewildering their under∣standings with
<HI>Coke, Plowden, Salkeld,</HI> &amp;c. have sense enough to follow the
same course of study.</P>
<P>TOM RIOT, the principal ornament of my class of stu∣dents,
was sent to the <HI>Temple,</HI> not with any intention that he should
become a great lawyer, but merely because, for a few years, his father did
not know how to dispose of him other∣wise: but so unwearied has been
his application to the new method, that his father and the rest of his
friends will, I doubt not, be surprized at his wonderful proficiency. As 
<PB N="802" REF="377"/> nothing is of more consequence to those gentlemen,
who in∣tend to harangue at the bar, than the acquiring a ready elo∣cution, and
an easy habit of delivering their thoughts in pub∣lic, to this I paid
particular attention. For this purpose, I advised him to a diligent
attendance on the theatres, and I assure you, Mr. TOWN, he never fails to
take notes at a new play, and seldom or never misses appearing at one
house or the other in the green boxes. He has also gathered many beautiful
flowers of rhetorick, unblown upon by all other orators ancient or modern, from
the <HI>Robin Hood</HI> Society; and at the same place he has collected the
strongest argu∣ments on every subject, and habituated himself to modes
of reasoning never hitherto introduced into courts of justice. But what has
been of more than ordinary service to him, and is particularly recommended by
Lord <HI>Coke</HI> himself, who calls 
<Q REND="inline">"conference the life of study,"</Q> is his
so frequent atten∣dance at <HI>George</HI>'s and the other coffee-houses
about the <HI>Tem∣ple,</HI> where every student has so many opportunities
of bene∣fiting himself by daily conversation with counsellors,
attor∣nies, clerks to attornies, and other sages of law.</P>
<P>THE law is intended to take cognisance of all our actions,
wherefore my pupil, who is fond of exerting his faculties in polite life, has
already digested almost all the grand lead∣ing points of the law into a
journal of his transactions, which I shall lay before my readers at large
in my treatise, as the best method for a common-place-book. Thus for
instance, having been frequently employed, after leaving the
<HI>Shake∣speare,</HI> in what is called <HI>beating the rounds,</HI> it has
happened to him to be taken into custody by the magistrate of the night,
and carried the next morning before a justice, by which means he has attained
as full a knowledge of certain parts of the duty of a constable and justice
of peace, as could be collected from <HI>Dalton, Blackerby,</HI> or
<HI>Burn.</HI> Certain impertinences of his taylor and other tradesmen have
given him a very clear notion of the laws of arrest, and been of as 
<PB N="803" REF="378"/> much service to him as the best treatises on bail
and main-prize. Besides which, the several sums of money which he has
taken up at different times payable on his father's death, have opened to him
some difficult points in conveyancing, by teaching him the nature of bonds,
deeds, &amp;c. and have at the same time shewn him what Lord <HI>Coke</HI>
calls, 
<Q REND="inline">"the ami∣able and admirable secrets of the
common law,"</Q> by un∣ravelling to him the intricate doctrines of reversion
and re∣mainder, as well as the general nature of estates. Thus he is
continually improving, and whenever he should happen to commit a rape or a
genteel murder, it will serve him for matter of instruction as well as any
history of the pleas of the crown, and give him an insight into the nature
of the prac∣tice and extent of the jurisdiction of our courts of
justice.</P>
<P>BY this plan of study no time is lost; so that while
other students are idling away their vacation in the country, my pupil is
daily improving there. As he is a member of the association, he is very
conversant in all the laws enacted for the preservation of the game; and he
picks up all the learning of the circuit by dancing at the Balls at the
assizes. As his father has a place, he is employed in canvassing for
votes at the time of an election, which instructs him in all the points of
law touching those matters. He was principally concerned in discovering the
<HI>Customary Tenants,</HI> the new species of freeholders unknown to
<HI>Littleton, Coke,</HI> and all the lawyers of antiquity: and he is so
intimately acquainted with all the doctrine contained in the several
clauses of the bribery act, that I propose publishing in the body of my
treatise <HI>Les Read∣ings Del Mon Seignior</HI> RIOT <HI>Sur L'Estatute
de</HI> 2 <HI>Geo.</HI> 2. &amp;c.</P>
<P>BY this time, Mr. TOWN, you must perceive that the ground of
my scheme is in short no more than this, <HI>viz.</HI> that the student
should regard his life as a kind of commentary on the law, as it is
recommended to the clergy to become examples of the doctrine they teach. Or to
bring my illus∣tration more home to these gentlemen, let them learn the law
by being occasionally interested in different parts of it, 
<PB N="804" REF="379"/> as they become in some measure doctors of physic
from fre∣quent need of it, and can cure themselves in certain cases as well
as <HI>Rock</HI> himself. Instead of poring over books, a gen∣tleman need
only observe, how far the law and his actions tally with each other; and as
it is said by Lord <HI>Coke,</HI> 
<Q REND="inline">"that the knowledge of the law is like a deep
well, out of which each man draweth according to the strength of his
understanding,"</Q> so in persuance of my plan, the student will
improve according to the eagerness with which he engages in his pleasures:
and this, no doubt, was intended by Lord <HI>Coke,</HI> as it is the most
obvious inter∣pretation of his words, when he concludes the comparison by
saying, that 
<Q REND="inline">"when the professor of the law can dive
into the depth, it is <HI>delightful, easy,</HI> and <HI>without any heavy
bur∣then,</HI> so long as he keep himself <HI>in his own proper
element.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>WHAT plan, Mr. TOWN, can be more <HI>delightful, easy,</HI>
and <HI>without any heavy burthen</HI> than Institutes of this nature? I have
indeed often looked with concern upon those unhappy gentlemen who have
impaired their health by the old me∣thod of study, and considered them as
martyrs to huge vo∣lumes of reports and statutes at large: my pupils will be
in no danger of these misfortunes. It is recorded of an emi∣nent counsellor
of the <HI>North</HI> family, who being one of the ablest practitioners at
the bar, was so overloaded with business, that sometimes chusing to
retire awhile from hurry and per∣plexity, he would say to his clerk 
<Q REND="inline">"Tell the people I do not practise this
term."</Q> This proper relaxation I always recommend to my pupils, and have
some reason to think they are prudent enough to embrace it; for as I am
ac∣quainted with several students on the new plan, and do not remember to
have seen them doing any business in the courts for some time. I
suppose they had given notice to their clerks 
<Q REND="inline">"to tell the people that they did not
practise in those terms."</Q></P>

<LETTER>
<HEAD>Mr. VILLAGE to Mr. TOWN.</HEAD>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>Dear Cousin,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE country at present, no less than the metropolis,
abounding with politicians of every kind, I begun to despair of picking up
any intelligence, that might possibly be entertaining to your readers.
However, I have made a tour to some of the most distant parts of the
kingdom with a clergy∣man of my acquaintance; and shall not trouble you with
an account of the improvements that have been made in the seats we saw
according to the modern taste, but pro∣ceed <PB N="806" REF="381"/> to give
you some reflections, which occurred to us on observing several country
churches, and the behaviour of their congregations.</P>
<P>THE ruinous condition of some of these churches gave me
great offence; and I could not help wishing, that the honest vicar,
instead of indulging his genius for im∣provements, by inclosing his
gooseberry bushes with a <HI>Chinese</HI> rail, and converting half an
acre of his glebe-land into a bowling-green, would have applied part of his
in∣come to the more laudable purpose of sheltering his pa∣rishioners from
the weather during their attendance on divine service. It is no uncommon
thing to see the par∣sonag -house well thatched, and in exceeding good
re∣pair, while the church perhaps has no better roof than the ivy that grows
over it. The noise of owls, bats and magpies makes a principal part of the
church musick in many of these ancient edifices; and the walls, like a
large map, seem to be portioned out into capes, seas, and pro∣montories by
the various colours with which the damps have stained them. Sometimes it has
happened, that the foundation being too weak to support the steeple any
longer, it has been found expedient to pull down that part of the building, and
to hang the bells under a wooden shed on the ground beside it. This is the
case in a parish in <HI>Norfolk,</HI> through which I lately passed,
and where the clerk and the sexton, like the two figures at St.
<HI>Dun∣stan</HI>'s, serve the bells in capacity of clappers, by striking
them alternately with a hammer.</P>
<P>IN other churches I have observed, that nothing un∣seemly
or ruinous is to be found, except in the clergyman, and in the appendages of
his person. The squire of the pa∣rish, <PB N="807" REF="382"/> or his
ancestors perhaps, to testify their devotion, and leave a lasting
monument of their magnificence, have adorned the altar-piece with the richest
crimson velvet, embroidered with vine-leaves and ears of wheat, and have
dressed up the pulpit with the same splendour and expence; while the
gentleman who fills it is exalted in the midst of all this finery with a
surplice as dirty as a farmer's frock, and a periwig that seems to have
trans∣ferred its faculty of curling to the band, that appears in full-buckle
beneath it,</P>
<P>BUT if I was concerned to see many of our country churches
in a tottering condition, I was more offended with the indecency of worship
in others. I could wish that the pastors would inform their hearers, that
there is no occasion to scream themselves hoarse in making the
responses, that the town-cryer is not the only person qualified to pray
with due devotion, and that he who bawls the loudest may nevertheless be
the wickedest fellow in the parish. The old women too in the ayle might be
told that their time would be better employed in attending to the sermon,
than in fumbling over their tattered testaments till they have found the
text, by which time the discourse is near drawing to a conclu∣sion; while
a word or two of instruction might not be thrown away upon the younger part
of the congregation to teach them, that making posies in summer-time, and
cracking nuts in autumn, is no part of the religious ceremony.</P>
<P>THE good old practice of psalm-singing is, indeed,
wonderfully improved in many country churches since the days of
<HI>Sternhold</HI> and <HI>Hopkins</HI>; and there is scarce a 
<PB N="808" REF="383"/> parish-clerk, who has so little taste as not to
pick his staves out of the New Version. This has occasioned great
complaints in some places, where the clerk has been forced to bawl by
himself, because the rest of the congregation cannot find the psalm at
the end of their prayer-books; while others are highly disgusted at the
innovation, and stick as obstinately to the Old Version as to the Old
Stile. The tunes themselves have also been new-set to jiggish
measures; and the sober drawl, which used to accompany the two first
staves of the hundredth psalm with the <HI>gloria patri,</HI> is now
split into as many quavers as an <HI>Italian</HI> air. For this purpose
there is in every county an itinerant band of vocal musicians, who make it
their business to go round to all the churches in their turns, and, after a
prelude with the pitch-pipe, astonish the audience with hymns set to the
new <HI>Win∣chester</HI> measure and anthems of their own composing. As
these new-fashioned psalmodists are necessarily made up of young
men and maids, we may naturally suppose, that there is a perfect concord
and symphony between them: and, indeed, I have known it happen, that these
sweet singers have been brought more than once into disgrace, by too
close an unison between the thorough-base and the treble.</P>
<P>IT is a difficult matter to decide, which is looked upon to be
the greatest man in a country church, the parson or his clerk. The latter
is most certainly held in higher veneration, where the former happens to be
only a poor curate, who rides post every sabbath from village to village,
and mounts and dismounts at the church-door. The clerk's office is not only
to tag the prayers with an <HI>Amen,</HI> or usher in the sermon with a
stave; but he is also the universal <PB N="809" REF="384"/> father to give
away the brides, and the standing god∣father to all the new-born brats. But
in many places there is a still greater man belonging to the church, than
either the parson or the clerk himself. The person I mean is the
squire; who, like the King, may be stiled Head of the Church in his own
parish. If the benefice be in his own gift, the vicar is his creature, and of
con∣sequence entirely at his devotion: or, if the care of the church is left
to a curate, the Sunday fees of roast beef and plumb pudding, and a liberty
to shoot in the manor, will bring him as much under the squire's command as
his dogs and horses. For this reason the bell is often kept tolling, and
the people waiting in the church-yard, an hour longer than the usual time;
nor must the service begin, till the squire has strutted up the ayle,
and seated himself in the great pew in the chancel. The length of the
sermon is also measured by the will of the squire, as formerly by the
hour-glass: and I know one parish where the preacher has always the
complaisance to break off to a conclusion, the minute that the squire
gives the signal by rising up after his nap.</P>
<P>IN a village church, the squire's lady or the vicar's wife
are perhaps the only females that are stared at for their finery: but in the
larger cities and towns, where the newest fashions are brought down weekly
by the stage-coach or waggon, all the wives and daughters of the most
topping tradesmen vie with each other every Sunday in the elegance of their
apparel. I could even trace the gradations in their dress according to the
opu∣lence, the extent, and the distance of the place from <HI>London.</HI> I
was at church in a populous city in the north, where the mace-bearer cleared
the way for Mrs. Mayoress, <PB N="810" REF="385"/> who came sidling after
him in an enormous fan-hoop, of a pattern which had never been seen before in
those parts. At another church in a corporation-town, I saw several
Negligeès, with furbelow'd aprons, which had long dis∣puted the prize
of superiority: but these were most woe∣fully eclipsed by a burgess's
daughter just come from <HI>London,</HI> who appeared in a Trolloppeè
or Slammerkin, with treble ruffles to the cuffs, pinked and gymped, and the
sides of the petticoat drawn up in festoons. In some lesser borough
towns the contest, I found, lay between three or four black and green bibs
and aprons: at one a grocer's wife attracted our eyes by a new-fashioned cap
called a Joan; and at another they were wholly taken up by a mercer's daughter
in a Nun's Hood.</P>
<P>I NEED not say any thing of the behaviour of the
con∣gregations in these more polite places of religious resort; as the
same genteel ceremonies are practised there as at the most fashionable
churches at the court end of the town. The ladies immediately on their entrance
breathe a pious ejaculation through their fan-sticks, and the beaus very
gravely address themselves to the Haberdashers' Bills glewed upon the
linings of their hats. This pious duty is no sooner performed, than the
exercise of bowing and curtsying succeeds; the locking and unlocking of
the pews drowns the reader's voice at the beginning of the service, and the
rustling of silks, added to the whispering and tittering of so much
good company, renders him totally unintelligible to the very end of it.</P>

who never talk above a quarter of an hour together on any one subject, are
not expected to enter into philosophical disquisitions, or en∣gage in
abstract speculations: but it is supposed to be our principal aim to
amuse and instruct the reader by a lively representation of what
passes round about him. Thus, like those painters who delineate the 
<PB N="818" REF="393"/> scenes of familiar life, we sometimes give a
sketch of a Marriage <HI>à là mode,</HI> sometimes draw the
outlines of a Modern Midnight conversation, at another time paint the comical
distresses of itinerant Tragedians in a barn, and at another give a full
draught of the Rake's or Harlot's progress. Sometimes we divert the public by
exhibiting single portraits; and when we meet with a subject where the
features are strongly marked by nature, and there is something peculiarly
characteristic in the whole manner, we employ ourselves in drawing a full
length. In a word, we consider all mankind as sitting for their pictures,
and endeavour to work up our pieces with lively traits, and embellish them
with beautiful colouring: and though perhaps they are not always highly
finished, yet they seldom fail of pleasing some few at least of the
vast multitude of Critics and Con∣noisseurs, if we are so happy as to
hit off a striking likeness.</P>
<P>THERE is perhaps no knowledge more requisite, and certainly
none at present more ardently sought after, than the Knowledge of the
World. In this science we are more particularly expected to be adepts, as
well as to ini∣tiate, or at least improve our readers in it. And though this
knowledge cannot be collected altogether from books, yet (as <HI>Pope</HI>
says) 
<Q REND="inline">"Men may be read as well as books too much;"</Q>
and it is to be lamented, that many, who have only consulted the volume of
life as it lay open be∣fore them, have rather become worse than better by
their studies. They, who have lived wholly in the world <PB N="819" REF="394"/> without regarding the comments on it, are generally taint∣ed with
all its vices; to which the gathering part of their instructions from books
would perhaps have proved an antidote. There indeed, though they would have
seen the faults and foibles of mankind fairly represented, yet vice would
appear in an odious, and virtue in an amiable light; but those, who unwarned
go abroad into the world, are often dazzled by the splendor with which wealth
gilds vice and infamy, and being accustomed to see bare∣foot honesty
treated with scorn, are themselves induced to consider it as
contemptible. For this reason I am a good deal offended at the ingenious
contrivance of our modern novellists and writers of comedy, who often gloss
over a villainous character with the same false varnish, that lackers
so many scoundrels in real life; and while they are exhibiting a fellow,
who debauches your daugh∣ter or lies with your wife, represent him as an
agreeable creature, a man of gallantry, and a fine gentleman.</P>
<P>THE world, even the gayest part of it, may be paint∣ed like
itself, and yet become a lesson of instruction. The pieces of
<HI>Hogarth</HI> (to recur to the illustration I first made use of) are
faithful delineations of certain scenes of life, and yet vice and folly
always appear odious and contem∣ptible. I could wish it were possible to
learn the know∣ledge of the world without being 
<Q REND="inline">"hackney'd in the ways of men;"</Q> but as that
is impracticable, it is still our duty so to live in it, as to avoid being
corrupted by our intercourse with mankind. We should endeavour to guard
against fraud, without becoming ourselves deceit∣ful; <PB N="820" REF="395"/> and to see every species of vice and folly practised round
about us, without growing knaves and fools. The villainy of others is but a
poor excuse for the loss of our own integrity; and though, indeed, if I am
attacked on <HI>Hounslow-Heath,</HI> I may lawfully kill the highwayman in my
own defence, yet I should be very deservedly brought to the gallows, if I
took a purse from the next person I met, because I had been robbed
myself.</P>
<P>THE Knowledge of the World, as it is generally un∣derstood,
consists not so much in a due reflection on its vices and follies, as in
the practice of them; and those, who consider themselves as best
acquainted with it, are either the dupes of fashion, or slaves of
interest. It is al∣so supposed to lie within the narrow compass of
every man's own sphere of life, and receives a different interpre∣tation in
different stations. Thus, for instance, the man of fashion seeks it
no-where but in the polite circle of the <HI>beau-monde,</HI> while the man of
business looks no farther for it than the <HI>Alley.</HI> I shall beg
leave to illustrate this by two characters; each of whom, though
diametrically op∣posite to the other, has acquired a thorough Knowledge of
the World.</P>
<P>SIR <HI>Harry Flash</HI> had the good luck to be born be∣fore
his brother <HI>Richard:</HI> consequently the heir to the estate was bred
a gentleman, and the other condemned to plod in the dull drudgery of
business. The merchant was sent to learn accompts at the Academy upon
<HI>Tower-Hill,</HI> and the baronet had the finishing of his education in 
<PB N="821" REF="396"/> <HI>France.</HI> Sir <HI>Harry</HI> is now a most
accomplished fine gentleman, is an excellent judge of fashions, and can
cal∣culate the odds at any game as readily as <HI>Hoyle</HI> or
<HI>De∣moivre:</HI> the Alderman is the most knowing man upon
<HI>'Change,</HI> and understands the rise and fall of Stocks bet∣ter than
any <HI>Jew.</HI> Both of them know the world; but with this difference, that
one by his consummate know∣ledge has run out a large estate, while the
other has raised a plumb by it.</P>
<P>BEFORE I conclude, it will be proper to take notice of the great
improvements made by our modern ladies in this part of their education. The
pretty creatures were formerly kept at home, and employed in the domestic
cares of good housewifery: they were taught as much as possible to shun
the company of the men, and knew no more of the world than a cloistered Nun.
But these restraints are now happily removed by the present mode of
education. The little lady, instead of being sent to the boarding-school
to learn needle-work, is introduced to the politest routs and assemblies,
and taught to make one at the card-table: she is carried about to
<HI>Vauxhall, Rane∣lagh,</HI> and other genteel places of amusement; and
besides these, if we add a trip to <HI>Bath</HI> or <HI>Cheltenham,</HI>
there is no doubt but she is completely versed in the Knowledge of the
World. This, we must own, is very necessary to be attained by ladies of
fashion: but it is with great concern that I have observed the inferior
rank of females fre∣quenting the same schools, and learning the same
lessons. Some have purchased their knowledge very dearly at the 
<PB N="822" REF="397"/> expence of their reputation, while others have laid out
their whole fortunes to acquire it; and I could not but smile the other day
at reading an advertisement in the public papers, begging our charity for a
poor distressed gentlewoman, who had formerly lived well, and seen a
great deal of the World.</P>

<LETTER>
<HEAD>TO Mr. TOWN.</HEAD>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline"><SEG REND="decorInit">W</SEG>HAT cloying meat is love, when ma∣trimony is
the sauce to it!"</Q> says Sir <HI>John Brute.</HI> But if he had been
joined to such an <HI>Epicurean</HI> consort as I, those expressions
that favour of the kitchen would have been real, instead of metaphorical. We
live in a land really flowing with milk and honey, and keep a house of
entertainment for all comers and goers. We <PB N="824" REF="399"/> hardly ever
sit down to table less in number than twenty or thirty, and very often to
above double that number of dishes. In short, sir, so much feasting
has given me a surfeit.</P>
<P>THERE are, I see, scattered up and down your pa∣pers,
several accounts of the petty distresses and domestic concerns of
private families. As you have listened to many complaints from husbands, I
flatter myself you will not refuse your attention to the humble
remonstrance of a wife; being assured, that my only reason for thus
serv∣ing up my dear lord as a new dish to gratify the public taste, is to
check (if possible) his violent passion for give∣ing his friends
entertainments of another kind; which, if indulged much longer, must eat us
out of house and home.</P>
<P>THE magnificent feasts of <HI>Timon</HI> of <HI>Athens,</HI>
or the sto∣ries of old <HI>English</HI> Hospitality, would give you but a
faint idea of the perpetual riot and luxury of our family. Our house is
always stored with as large a quantity of provisi∣ons as a garrison in
expectation of a siege, and those too of the dearest and most
extravagant kind. Ortolans and woodcocks are as plenty as sparrows, and red
mullets are scarce a greater rarity with us than gudgeons or sprats; while
turtle and venison are regarded as branches of ci∣tizen-luxury, which
scarce deserve notice among the ma∣ny other delicacies in which we abound.
Authors, they say, (you will pardon me, Mr. TOWN,) are seldom ad∣mitted to
great entertainments; and I can assure you, that it is not easy for any,
but those who are present, to conceive the parade and extravagance
displayed in our house. I myself am condemned to sit at the head of the
<PB N="825" REF="400"/> table, while my lord is placed at the other end, in pain
and uneasiness at my aukward mistakes in <HI>doing the ho∣nours.</HI> You
must know, sir, that I was bred up under an housewifely aunt in the
country, who taught me to pickle and preserve, and gave me, as I thought, a
tole∣rable notion of cookery. But, alas! though I under∣stand plain boiled
and roast, and have a very good notion of a pudding, I am often totally
ignorant of the names and compositions of the delicacies before me, and have
imagined fish to be fowl, and mistaken a <HI>petit pateè</HI> for a
plebeian mince-pie. In the mean time my lord is dis∣playing his exquisite
taste by deciding upon every dish, and pronouncing with a critical smack
upon the flavour of the wines; all the while not a little solicitous about
the exactness of the Removes, and the duly adjusting the
<HI>entremets.</HI> Claret, Burgundy, and Champagne are as common as ale or
small-beer; and even Hermitage and Tokay are swallowed with as little
remorse as Port of Lis∣bon. To add to all this, is most absurdly
introduced the <HI>French</HI> custom of serving in <HI>les Liqueurs,</HI>
which consist of almost as many sorts as are contained in the
advertisements from the Rich Cordial Warehouse. In a word, every common
dinner with us is a feast; and when we have what my lord calls an
entertainment, it is an absolute de∣bauch.</P>
<P>BUT there is no part of this monstrous expence af∣fects me
so much as the vast sums ridiculously lavished on a Desert. This
piece of folly and extravagance could be nothing but the joint product of a
<HI>Frenchman</HI> and a con∣fectioner. After the gratification of the appetite
with more substantial fare, this whipt-syllabub raree-shew is served
up chiefly to feed the eye; not but that the mate∣rials, <PB N="826" REF="401"/>
of which the Desert is composed, are as expensive as the several
ingredients in the dinner: and I will leave you to your own method of rating
the rest, after telling you that my lord thinks himself an excellent
oecono∣mist, by having reduced the expence of the Hot-House to a thousand
<HI>per ann.</HI> which perhaps the admirers of exotic fruits will not think
dear, as we have pine-apples as plenty as golden-pippins or nonpareils.</P>
<P>ONE would think, that the first requisite in eating was
extravagance, and that in order to have any thing very good, it must be eat
at a time that it is out of season. Therefore one of the principal uses
of our Hot-House is to invert the order of nature, and to turn winter into
summer. We should be ashamed to see peas upon our table, while they are
to be had at a common market; but we never spare any cost to provide a good
crop by the assistance of our hot-beds at <HI>Christmas.</HI> We have
no relish for cucumbers during the summer months, when they are no rarity;
but we take care to have them forced in <HI>November.</HI> But my lord mostly
prides himself on the improvements that he has made in his Mushroom-Beds,
which he has at length brought to so great perfection, that by the help of
horse-dung, and throwing artificial sun-beams through a burning-glass, we
can raise any quantity of Mushrooms of the right <HI>Italian</HI> kind at
two hours warning.</P>
<P>FROM the Hot-House we may make a very natural transition
to the Kitchen; and as in the former every thing must be produced out of
season, so every thing in the latter must undergo a strange
metamorphosis. The ordinary distinctions of fish, flesh, and fowl are
quite <PB N="827" REF="402"/> destroyed; and nothing comes upon table under
its proper form and appellation. It is impossible to conceive what vast
sums are melted down into sauces! We have a cargo of hams every year from
<HI>Westphalia,</HI> only to ex∣tract the <HI>Essence</HI> of them for
our soups; and we kill a brace of bucks every week, to make a <HI>Cullis</HI>
of the haunches. Half a dozen turkies have been killed in one day merely for
the sake of the pinions; and I have known a whole pond dragged to furnish a
dish of Carps' Palates, and ten legs of mutton mangled raw to make out a
dish of Pope's Eyes.</P>
<P>THE concomitant charges of the cellar, you will ima∣gine, are
no less extravagant; and, indeed, it is not enough that we abound in the
best <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Italian</HI> wines, (which by the bye are
purchased on the spot at an extraordinary price,) but we must have
several other kinds of the highest value, and consequently a most
delicious flavour. And though but a taste of each has been sipped round by
the company, the same bottles must never be brought a second time upon
table, but are secured as perquisites by the butler, who fells them to the
merchant, who sells them back again to my lord. Besides these, his
lordship has lately been at an immense charge in raising a Pinery, in
order to try the experiment of making Cyder of Pine-apples; which he hopes to
do at little more than treble the expence of Champagne. To this article I might
also add the charge of his Ice-Houses: for although these are stored
with an home-commodity originally of no value, yet I may
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> to say, that every drop of
water comes as dear to us as the most costly of our wines.</P>
<P><PB N="828" REF="403"/>AS all our liquors, I have told you, are
of foreign growth, and all our dishes distinguished by foreign titles,
you will readily conceive, that our houshold is chiefly composed of
foreigners. The butler out of livery, and his two under-butlers, are
<HI>Frenchmen:</HI> the clerk of the kitchen is a <HI>Frenchman:</HI> and
<HI>Monsieur Fri∣cando,</HI> the head-cook, to be sure is a
<HI>Frenchman.</HI> This gentleman never soils his fingers in touching the
least bit of any thing, but gives his orders (like a general) to four
subalterns, who are likewise <HI>Frenchmen.</HI> The baker, the
confectioner, the very scullions, and even the fellow that looks after the
poultry, are all of them <HI>Frenchmen.</HI> These, you may be sure, are
maintained at very high salaries: and though <HI>Monsieur Fricando</HI> had
the pay of a captain in a marching regiment, my lord was forced to double his
wages at the beginning of the war, and allow him the free exercise of his
<HI>religion,</HI> to prevent his leaving the kingdom.</P>
<P>I AM sorry to add, that this pride of keeping a table has
visibly impaired my lord's fortunes: and this very summer he has been
obliged to fell all the timber on his estate, as I may say, to keep up his
kitchen fire. The only satisfaction he can possibly reap from all this
ex∣pence is the vanity of having it said, 
<Q REND="inline">"that no-body treats so elegantly as his
lordship,"</Q> and now and then perhaps reading in the news-papers, 
<Q REND="inline">"that such a day the right honourable
— gave a grand entertainment at his house in —, at which were
present the prin∣cipal Officers of State and Foreign Ministers."</Q></P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>N the comedy of the <HI>Frenchman in Lon∣don,</HI> which we
are told was acted at <HI>Paris</HI> with universal applause for several
nights together, there is a character of a rough <HI>Englishman,</HI> who is
represented as quite unskilled in the graces of conversation; and his
dialogue is made up of almost nothing but a repetition of the common
salutation of <HI>how do you do, how do you do?</HI> Our nation has, indeed,
been generally supposed to be of a sullen and uncommunicative
disposition; while, on <PB N="830" REF="405"/> the other hand, the
loquacious <HI>French</HI> have been allowed to possess the art of
conversing beyond all other people. The <HI>Englishman</HI> requires to be
wound up frequently, and stops as soon as he is down; but the
<HI>Frenchman</HI> runs on in a continued alarum. Yet it must be
acknow∣ledged, that as the <HI>English</HI> consist of very different
hu∣mours, their manner of discourse admits of great variety: but the whole
<HI>French</HI> nation converse alike; and there is no difference in their
address between a <HI>Marquis</HI> and a <HI>Valet de Chambre.</HI> We may
frequently see a couple of <HI>French</HI> barbers accosting each other in
the street, and paying their compliments with the same volubility of
speech and grimace of action, as two courtiers in the
<HI>Thuilleries.</HI></P>
<P>I SHALL not attempt to lay down any particular rules for
conversation, but point out such faults in the discourse and behaviour,
as render the company of half mankind rather tedious than amusing. It is in
vain, indeed, to look for conversation, where we might expect to find it in
the greatest perfection, among persons of fashion; where it is almost
annihilated by universal card-playing: insomuch that I have heard it given
as a reason, why it is impossible for our present writers to succeed
in the dialogue of genteel comedy, that our people of quality scarce ever
meet but to game. All their discourse turns upon the odd trick and the four
honours: and it is no less a maxim with the votaries of Whist than with
those of <HI>Bacchus,</HI> that talking spoils company. Every one
endeavours to make himself as agreeable to society as he can: but it often
happens, that those, who most aim at shining in conversation,
over-shoot their mark: and though a man succeeds, he should not (as is
frequently <PB N="831" REF="406"/> the case) engross the whole talk to
himself; for that destroys the very essence of conversation, which is
talk∣ing together. We should try to keep up conversation like a ball
bandied to and fro from one to the other, rather than seize it all to
ourselves, and drive it before us like a foot-ball. We should likewise be
cautious to adapt the matter of our discourse to our company; and not talk
<HI>Greek</HI> before the ladies, or of the last new furbelow to a meeting of
country justices.</P>
<P>THE pests and nuisances of society, which are com∣monly to
be met with, may be ranged in the following manner. And first, the
Attitudinarians and Face-makers. These accompany every word with a peculiar
grimace or gesture: they assent with a shrug, and contradict with a
twisting of the neck; are angry with a wry mouth, and pleased in a caper or
a minuet step. They may be considered as speaking Harlequins; and their
rules of eloquence are taken from the posture-master. These should be
condemned to converse only in dumb shew with their own persons in the
looking-glass; as also the Smirkers and Smilers, who so prettily set
off their faces together with their words by a <HI>je ne sçai
quoi</HI> between a grin and a dimple. With these we may likewise rank the
affected tribe of Mimics, who are constantly taking off the peculiar tone of
voice or gesture of their ac∣quaintance: though they 
<Q REND="inline">"imitate humanity so abomi∣nably,"</Q> that
(like bad painters) they are frequently forced to write the name under the
picture, before we can discover any likeness.</P>
<P>NEXT to these, whose elocution consists chiefly in the
action, we may consider the profest speakers. And first, 
<PB N="832" REF="407"/> of the Emphatical; who squeeze, and press, and beat
down every syllable with as much vehemence, as a paviour thumps the pebbles
with his rammer. These energetic orators are remarkable for the force of
expression, with which they utter the particle <HI>the</HI> and conjunctive
<HI>and</HI>; which they seem to hawk up with much difficulty out of their
own throats, and to cram them with no less pain in∣to the ears of their
auditors. These should be suffered only to syringe (as it were) the
ears of a deaf man through an hearing trumpet: and with these we may join the
Whisperers or Low Speakers, who come up so close to you, that they may be
said to measure noses with you, and have frequently a stinking breath.
I would have these oracular gentry obliged to talk at a distance through a
speaking trumpet, or apply their lips to the walls of a whispering gallery.
The Wits, who will not condescend to utter any thing but a <HI>bon mot,</HI>
and the Whistlers or Tune-hummers, who never articulate at all, may be joined
very agreeably together in concert: and to these tinkling cymbals I would
also add the sounding brass; the Bawler, who inquires after your health
with the bellowing of a town-cryer.</P>
<P>THE Tatlers, whose pliable pipes are admirably adapt∣ed to the

<Q REND="inline">"soft parts of conversation,"</Q> and
sweetly 
<Q REND="inline">"prattling out of fashion,"</Q> make very
pretty musick from a beautiful face and a female tongue: but from a rough
manly voice and coarse features it is as harsh and dissonant as a jig
from a bagpipe. The Half-Swearers, who split, and mince, and fritter their
oaths into <HI>gad's bud, ad's fish</HI> and <HI>demmee,</HI> and the
Humbuggers, and those who nickname God's creatures, who call a man a
cab∣bage, a crab, a queer cub, an odd fish, and an unac∣countable 
<PB N="833" REF="408"/> muskin, should never come into company with∣out an
interpeter. But I shall not tire my reader's pa∣tience by pointing out
others, no less destructive of so∣ciety: such as the Sensibles, who
pronounce dogmatical∣ly on the most trivial points, and speak in
sentences; the Wonderers, who are always <HI>wondering</HI> what o'clock it
is, or <HI>wondering</HI> whether it will rain or no, or <HI>wondering</HI>
when the moon changes; and lastly, the Silent Men, who seem afraid of
opening their mouths for fear of catch∣ing cold, and literally observe the
precept of the gospel, by letting their conversation be only <HI>yea
yea,</HI> and <HI>nay nay.</HI></P>
<P>THE rational intercourse, which is mutually kept up among men
by conversing with each other, is one of our principal distinctions from
brutes: and it is imagined by some philosophers, that birds and beasts
(though with∣out the power of articulation) perfectly understand one another
by the sounds they utter; and that dogs, cats, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> have each a
particular language to themselves, like different nations. Thus it may be
supposed, that the nightingales of <HI>Italy</HI> have as fine an ear for
their own na∣tive wood-notes, as any <HI>Signor</HI> or <HI>Signora</HI> for an
<HI>Italian Air;</HI> that the boars of <HI>Westphalia</HI> gruntle as
expressively through the nose, as the inhabitants in
<HI>High-German</HI>; and that the frogs in the dykes of <HI>Holland</HI> croak
as intelligibly as the natives jabber their <HI>High-Dutch.</HI> However this
may be, we may consider those, who let their tongues always vibrate as
their hearts beat, and do not keep up the proper conversation of human
creatures, as imitating the language of different animals. Thus, for
instance, the affinity between Chatterers and Monkeys, and Praters and
Parrots, is too obvious not to occur at once: Grunters <PB N="834" REF="409"/>
and Growlers may be justly compared to Hogs: Snarlers are Curs, that
continually shew their teeth, but never bite; and the Spitfire Passionate
are a sort of wild Cats, that will not bear stroaking, but will purr when
they are pleased. Complainers are Scriech-Owls; and Story-tel∣lers, who are
always repeating the same dull note, are Cuckows. Poets, that prick up their
ears at their own hideous braying, are no better than Asses: Critics in
gene∣ral are venomous serpents, that delight in hissing; and some of
them, who have got by heart a few technical terms without knowing their
meaning, are no other than Magpies. I myself, who have crowed to the whole
town for near three years past, may perhaps put my readers in mind of a
Dunghill Cock: but as I must acquaint them, that they will hear the last of
me on this day fortnight, I hope they will then consider me as a Swan, who is
supposed to sing sweetly at his dying moments.</P>

him, which I shall lay before my readers.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>DEAR COUSIN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT was not without some regret, that I received advice of
your intentions to bid adieu to the public: for as you had been so kind as to
introduce me to their notice, I began to indulge all the weakness and vanity
of a young author; and had almost persuaded myself, that I was the
principal support of your papers. Conscious of my own importance, I expect
that you will do me the justice to acknowledge, how much you are indebted to
the as∣sistance <PB N="836" REF="411"/> of your very ingenious Cousin;
and I care not how many compliments you pay me on my wit and learning: but at
the same time I must beg leave to put in a caveat against your
disposing of me in what manner you yourself please. Writers of
essays think themselves at liberty to do what they will with the
characters they have introduced into their works: as writers of tragedy, in
order to heighten the plot, have brought their heroes to an untimely end, when
they have died quietly many years before in their beds; or as our chroniclers
of daily occurrences put a duke to death, give away an heiress in marriage,
or shoot off an admiral's legs, whenever they please. Mr. ADDISON, while he
was carrying on the SPECTATOR, said 
<Q REND="inline">"he would kill Sir <HI>Roger de Coverly,</HI>
that nobody else might murder him:"</Q> In like manner, my dear Cousin, you
may perhaps take it into your head to cut me off: you may make an end of me by
a cold caught in partridge-shooting, or break my neck in a stag∣hunt. Or
you may rather chuse to settle me perhaps with a rich old country dowager,
or press me into the army, or clap me on board of a man of war. But I
desire that you will not get rid of me by any of these means: but permit me
to assure your readers, that I am alive and merry; and this is to let them
know, that I am in good health at this present writing.</P>
<P>YOUR papers, I assure you, have made a great noise in
the country; and the most intelligent among us read you with as much
satisfaction as the <HI>Evening Posts</HI> or the <HI>Weekly Journals.</HI>
I know more than one squire, who who takes them in constantly with the
<HI>Magazines</HI>; and I was told by the post-master of a certain town,
that they came down every week under cover to the but∣ler of a member of
parliament. There is a club of country parsons, who meet every
<HI>Saturday</HI> at a neigh∣bouring market-town, to be shaved and exchange
ser∣mons: they have a subscription for books and pamphlets; and the only
periodical works ordered in by them are <PB N="837" REF="412"/> the
<HI>Connoisseur,</HI> and the <HI>Critical</HI> and <HI>Monthly
Reviews.</HI> I was lately introduced to this society, when the
conver∣sation happened to turn upon Mr. TOWN. A young curate, just come
from <HI>Oxford,</HI> said he knew you very well at <HI>Christ Church,</HI>
and that you was a comical dog: but a <HI>Cantab.</HI> declared no less
positively, that you was either a pensioner of <HI>Trinity</HI> or a commoner
of <HI>Bennet</HI>'s. People, indeed, are very much perplexed about the real
author: some affirm, that you are a nobleman; and others will have it, that
you are an actor: some say you are a young lawyer, some a parson, and
some an old woman.</P>
<P>THE subjects of your papers have often been wrested to
various interpretations by our penetrating geniusses; and you have hardly
drawn a character, that has not been fixed on one or other of the greatest
personages in the nation. I once heard a country justice express his
won∣der, that you was not taken up, and set in the pillory; and I myself,
by some of my rural intelligence, have brought upon you the resentment of
several honest squires, who long to horse-whip the scoundrel for
putting them in print. Others again are quite at a loss how to pick out your
meaning, and in vain turn over their <HI>Bailey</HI>'s dictio∣nary for an
explanation of several fashionable phrases; which, though they have
enriched the town-language, have not yet made their way into the dialect of the
coun∣try. Many exquisite strokes of humour are also lost upon us, on
account of our distance from the scene of action; and the wit, which is
very brisk and lively upon the spot, loses much of its spirit in the
carriage, and sometimes wholly evaporates in the post-bag.</P>
<P>YOU moralists are very apt to flatter yourselves, that you
are doing a vast deal of good by your labours: but whatever reformation you
may have worked in town, give me leave to tell you, that you have sometimes
done us harm in the country, by the bare mention of the vices 
<PB N="838" REF="413"/> and follies now in vogue. From your intelligence some
of our most polite ladies have learned, that it is highly genteel to have a
route; and some have copied the fashion so exactly, as to play at cards
on <HI>Sundays.</HI> Your papers upon dress set all our belles at work in
following the mode: you no sooner took notice of the cocked hats, but every
hat in the parish was turned up behind and be∣fore; and when you told us,
that the town-beauties went naked, our rural damsels immediately began to
throw off their cloaths. Our gentlemen have been also taught by you all the
new arts of betting and gaming: and the only coffee-house in one little town,
where the most topping inhabitants are used to meet to play at draughts and
back-gammon, has, from the great increase of gamesters who resort to it,
been elegantly christened by the name of <HI>White</HI>'s.</P>
<P>AS to the small share, which I myself have had in your
work, you may be sure every body here is hugely delighted with it; at least
you may be sure, that I will say nothing to the contrary. I have done my
best to contribute to the entertainment of your readers: and as the name of
<HI>Steele</HI> is not forgot in the SPECTATOR, though <HI>Addison</HI> has
run away with almost all the honour, I am in hopes that whenever the great
Mr. TOWN is mentioned, they may possibly think at the same time on</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Your affectionate Cousin and Coadjutor,
VILLAGE.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>AFTER this account, which my Cousin has sent me, of the
reception I have met with in the country, it will be proper to say
something of my reception here in town. I shall therefore consider
myself in the threefold capacity of CONNOISSEUR, CRITIC, and CENSOR-GENERAL.
As a CONNOISSEUR, in the confined sense of the word, I must own I have
met with several mortifications. I have neither been made F. R. S. nor even a
member of the Academy of <HI>Bourdeaux</HI> or <HI>Petersburgh.</HI> They
have left <PB N="839" REF="414"/> me out of the list of Trustees to the
<HI>British Musaeum</HI>; and his Majesty of <HI>Naples,</HI> though he
presented an "Account of the Curiosities found in <HI>Herculaneum</HI>" to
each of the universities, never sent one to me. I have not been celebrated
in the Philosophical Transactions, or in any of our Magazines of Arts and
Sciences; nor have I been stiled <HI>tres-illustre</HI> or
<HI>tres-sçavant</HI> in any of the fo∣reign <HI>Mercures</HI> or
<HI>Journals Literaires.</HI> Once indeed, I soothed myself in the vain
thought of having been distin∣guished by the great <HI>Swedish</HI>
Botanist, <HI>Linnaeus,</HI> under the title of <HI>Eruditissimus
Urbanus,</HI> which I conceited to be the name of TOWN latinized; but to my
great disap∣pointment I afterwards discovered, that this was no other than
the learned Naturalist, Mr. <HI>Silvanus Urban,</HI> author of the
<HI>Gentleman's Magazine.</HI> This neglect of me, as a CONNOISSEUR, I can
attribute to no other cause, than to my not having made myself known by my
<HI>Musaeum</HI> or Cabinet of Curiosities: and to say the truth, I am
not worth a farthing in antique coins; nor have I so much as one single
shell or butterfly. All my complaints against the modern innovations of
Taste have been therefore disregarded: and with concern I still see the
Villas of our citizens fantastically adorned with <HI>Chinese</HI> palings,
and our streets encumbered with superb colonnades, porticos,
<HI>Gothic</HI> arches, and <HI>Venetian</HI> windows, before the shops of
our tradesmen.</P>
<P>NOR have I, as a CRITIC, met with greater success or
encouragement in my endeavours to reform the pre∣sent Taste in literature.
I expected to have the priviledge of eating beef <HI>gratis</HI> every night at
<HI>Vauxhall,</HI> for advising the garden-poets to put a little meaning into
their songs: but though I was there several nights this summer, I could
not say (with <HI>Cassio</HI>) of any of their productions, 
<Q REND="inline">"this is a more exquisite song than
t'other."</Q> I have not been able to write the operas out of the kingdom: and
though I have more than once shewed my contempt for Harlequin, I am
assured there are no less than three <PB N="840" REF="415"/> Pantomimes to
be brought on this season. As I set my∣self up for supreme judge in
theatrical matters, I was in hopes, that my Lord Chamberlain would at least
ap∣pointed me his Deputy-Licenser; but he has not even consult me on any
one new play. I made no doubt, but the managers would pay their court to me:
but they have not once sent for me to dinner; and so far from having the
freedom of the house, I declare I have not had so much as a single order
from any of the under-actors.</P>
<P>IN my office of CENSOR-GENERAL, though I cannot boast of
having over-turned the card-tables at routs and assemblies, or broke up the
club at <HI>Arthur</HI>'s, I can safely boast, that I have routed the
many-headed monster at the Disputant Society at the <HI>Robin-hood,</HI>
and put to silence the great <HI>Clare-market</HI> Orator. In a word, I have
la∣boured to prevent the growth of vice and immorality; and with as much effect
as the Justices at the Quarter-sessions. For this reason I expected
to have been put into commission, and to have had the power of licensing
all places of public diversion vested solely in my hands. But as I find
my merits have been hitherto overlooked, I am determined to lay down my office;
and in my next num∣ber I shall take my final leave of the public, when I
shall give them an account or my correspondents, together with a full and
particular account of MYSELF.</P>

burst forth at once, Mr. TOWN, must have introduced himself to the
acquaintance of the public with the aukward air and distance of a stranger;
but be now flatters himself, that they will look upon him as an old
companion, whose <PB N="842" REF="417"/> conversation they are pleased
with; and, as they will see him no more after this time, will now and then
perhaps miss their usual visiter.</P>
<P>HOWEVER this may be, the Authors of the CON∣NOISSEUR now think
proper to close the undertaking, in which they have been engaged for near
three years past: and among their general thanks to the indulgent readers of
their papers, they must include in a particular manner their acknowledgments
to those, who have been pleased to appear in them as writers. They have,
there∣fore, at the close of their work brought Mr. TOWN and all his
associates on the scene together, like the <HI>dra∣matis personae</HI>
at the end of the last act.</P>
<P>OUR earliest and most frequent correspondent is only known
to us by the initials G. K. and we are sorry, that he will not put it in our
power to mention his name; which (if we are not mistaken in our guess)
would reflect as much credit on our work, as we are sure will redound to it
from his contributions. To him we are proud to own ourselves indebted for
most part of N<SUP>o</SUP>. 14 and 17; for the letter, signed <HI>Goliah
English,</HI> in N<SUP>o</SUP>. 19; for a great part of N<SUP>o</SUP>. 33 and 40; and for the
letters, signed <HI>Reginald Fitzworm, Michael Krawbidge, Moses
Orthodox,</HI> and <HI>T. Vainall,</HI> in N<SUP>o</SUP>. 102, 107, 113, and 129.</P>
<P>THE next, in priority of time, is a gentleman of
<HI>Cam∣bridge,</HI> who signed himself A. B. and we cannot but re∣gret
that he withdrew his assistance, after having obliged us with the best
part of the letters in N<SUP>o</SUP>. 46, 49, and 52; and of the essays in N<SUP>o</SUP>. 62
and 64.</P>
<P>THE letters in N<SUP>o</SUP>. 82, 98, 112, and 130, came from various
hands, equally unknown to us. The Imi∣tation of <HI>Horace,</HI> in N<SUP>o</SUP>. 11,
was written (as we are in∣formed) by a gentleman of <HI>Oxford:</HI> the Ode to
Friend∣ship, in N<SUP>o</SUP>. 125, was sent to us by a gentleman of
<HI>Cam∣bridge</HI>; and from two other gentlemen of that University we
received the letter, signed <HI>W. Manly,</HI> in N<SUP>o</SUP>. 65, and another,
signed B. A. in N<SUP>o</SUP>. 107.</P>
<P><PB N="843" REF="418"/>THESE unexpected marks of favour,
conferred on us by strangers, demand our highest gratitude: but we are no
less happy in being able to boast of the assistance of some other
gentlemen, whom we are proud to call friends, though we are not at liberty to
introduce them to the acquaintance of our readers. From a friend, en∣gaged in
the Law, we had the first sketches and most striking passages in
N<SUP>o</SUP>. 75, 78, 87, and 104; though it may be regretted by the public as well as
ourselves, that his leisure would not permit him to put the finishing
hand to them. From a friend, a gentleman of the <HI>Temple,</HI> we received
N<SUP>o</SUP>. 111, 115, and 119. To a friend, a member of <HI>Trinity College,
Cambridge,</HI> we are indebted for the Song in N<SUP>o</SUP>. 72, and the Verses in
N<SUP>o</SUP>. 67, 90, 125, and 135. The list of contributions from such capable
friends would doubtless have been much larger, had they been sooner let
into the secret: but as Mr. TOWN, like a great prince, chose to appear
<HI>incog.</HI> in order to avoid the impertinence of others, he did not even
make himself known to those about his person, till at last they
themselves found him out through his disguise.</P>
<P>THERE are still remaining two correspondents, who must
stand by themselves; as they have wrote to us, not in an assumed
character, but <HI>in propriâ personâ.</HI> The first is no
less a personage than the great Orator HENLY, who obliged us with that
truly original letter, printed in N<SUP>o</SUP>. 37. The other, who favoured us with a
letter no less original in N<SUP>o</SUP>. 70, we have reason to be∣lieve, is a
Methodist Teacher and a mechanic; but we do not know either his name or his
trade.</P>
<P>WE now come to the most important discovery of Ourselves,
and to answer the often-repeated question of; <HI>Who is Mr.</HI> TOWN? it
being the custom for periodical writers, at the same time that they send
the hawkers abroad with their last dying speech like the malefactors, like
them also to couple it with a confession. The general method of
unravelling this mystery is by de∣claring, to whom the different signatures
affixed to dif∣ferent papers are appropriated. For ever since the days of the
inimitable SPECTATOR, it has been usual for a <PB N="844" REF="419"/> bold
Capital to stand, like a sentry, at the end of our essays, to guard the
author in secresy: and it is com∣monly supposed, that the writer, who
does not chuse to put his name to his work, has in this manner, like the
painters and statuaries of old, at least set his mark. But the Authors of
the CONNOISSEUR now confess, that the several letters, at first pitched
upon to bring up the rear of their essays, have been annexed to different
papers at random, and sometimes omitted, on purpose to put the sagacious
reader on a wrong scent. It is particularly the interest of a writer, who
prints himself out week by week, to remain unknown during the course of
this piece-meal publication. The best method, therefore, to prevent a
discovery is to make the road to it as intricate as possible; and,
instead of seeming to aim at keeping the reader entirely in the dark, to
hang out a kind of wan∣dering light, which only serves to lead him astray.
The desire of giving each writer his due, according to the signatures, has
in the course of this undertaking often confused the curious in their
inquiries. Soon after the publication of our first papers, some ingenious
gentlemen found out, that T, O, W, N, being the letters that form∣ed the name
of TOWN, there were four authors, each of whom sheltered himself under a
particular letter; but no paper ever appearing with an N affixed to it, they
were obliged to give up this notion. But, if they had been more able
decypherers, they would have made out, that though T, O, W, will not compose
the name of TOWN, yet by a different arrangement of the letters it will form
the word TWO; which is the grand mystery of our signatures, and couches
under it the true and real number of the Authors of the CONNOISSEUR.</P>
<P>HAVING thus declared Mr. TOWN to consist of two separate
individuals, it will perhaps be expected that, like two tradesmen, who have
agreed to dissolve their part∣nership, we should exactly ballance our
accounts, and assign to each his due parcel of the stock. But our
ac∣counts are of so intricate a nature, that it would be im∣possible for
us to adjust them in that manner. We have not only joined in the work taken
altogether, but almost every single paper is the joint product of both:
and, as we have laboured equally in erecting the fabric, we can∣not 
<PB N="845" REF="420"/> pretend, that any one particular part is the sole
work∣manship of either. An hint has perhaps been started by one of us,
improved by the other, and still further heigh∣tened by an happy coalition of
sentiment in both; as fire is struck out by a mutual collision of flint
and steel. Sometimes, like <HI>Strada</HI>'s lovers conversing with the
sym∣pathetic needles, we have written papers together at fifty miles
distance from each other: the first rough draught or loose minutes of an
essay have often travelled in the stage-coach from town to country, and
from country to town; and we have frequently waited for the postman (whom we
expected to bring us the precious remainder of a CONNOISSEUR) with the same
anxiety, as we should wait for the half of a bank note, without which the
other half would be of no value. These our joint labours, it may easily be
imagined, would have soon broke off ab∣ruptly, if either had been too fondly
attached to his own little conceits; or if we had conversed together with the
jealousy of a rival, or the complaisance of a formal ac∣quaintance, who
smiles at every word that is said by his companion. Nor could this work
have been so long car∣ried on, with so much chearfulness and good-humour
on both sides, if the Two had not been as closely united, as the two
Students, whom the SPECTATOR mentions as recorded by a <HI>Terrae Filius</HI>
at <HI>Oxford,</HI> 
<Q REND="inline">"to have had but one mind, one purse, one
chamber, and one hat."</Q></P>
<P>IT has been often remarked, that the reader is very desirous
of picking up some little particulars concerning the author of the book,
which he is perusing. To gratify this passion, many literary anecdotes
have been publish∣ed, and an account of their life, character, and behaviour,
has been prefixed to the works of our most celebrated writers.
Essayists are commonly expected to be their own Biographers: and perhaps
our readers may require some further intelligence concerning the Authors of
the CONNOISSEUR. But, as they have all along ap∣peared as a sort of
<HI>Sofias</HI> in literature, they cannot now describe themselves any
otherwise, than as one and the same person; and can only satisfy the
curiosity of the pub∣lic, by giving a short account of that respectable
personage Mr. TOWN, considering him as of the plural, or rather (according
to the <HI>Grecians</HI>) of the dual number.</P>
<P><PB N="846" REF="421"/>Mr. TOWN is a fair, black, middle-sized,
very short man. He wears his own hair, and a perriwig. He is about thirty
years of age, and not more than four and twenty. He is a Student of the Law,
and a Batchelor of Physic. He was bred at the University of
<HI>Oxford;</HI> where having taken no less than three degrees, he looks down
on many learned Professors, his inferiors: yet having been there but little
longer than to take the first degree of Batchelor of Arts, it has more than
once happened, that the CEN∣SOR-GENERAL of all <HI>England</HI> has been
reprimanded by the Censor of his College, for neglecting to furnish the
usual Essay, or (in the collegiate phrase) the Theme of the week.</P>
<P>This joint description of ourselves will, we hope,
sa∣tisfy the reader without any further information. For our own parts, we
cannot but be pleased with having raised this monument of our mutual
friendship and esteem: and if these essays shall continue to be
read, when they will no longer make their appearance as the fugitive pieces of
the week, we shall be happy in con∣sidering, that we are mentioned at the
same time. We have all the while gone on, as it were, hand in hand together:
and white we are both employed in furnishing matter for the paper now before
us, we cannot help smiling at our thus making our <HI>exit</HI> together,
like the two Kings of <HI>Brentford</HI> smelling at one nosegay.</P>
