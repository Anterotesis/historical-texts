<HEAD>AN HISTORY OF TESTACEOUS FISHES.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. I. Of the Shell of Testaceous Fishes.</HEAD>
<P>ONE is apt to combine very dissimilar objects in the same
groupe, when hurried into the vortex of method. No two animals are more unlike
each other than the whale and the limpet, the tortoise and the oyster. Yet,
as these animals must find some place in the picture of animated nature,
it is best to let them rest in the station where the generality of
mankind have assigned them; and as they have been willing to give them all
from their abode the name of fishes, it is wisest in us to conform.</P>
<P>But before I enter into any history of shell-fish, it may
not be improper to observe, that <PB N="2" REF="5"/> naturalists who have
treated on this part of hi∣story, have entirely attended to outward forms;
and, as in many other instances, forsaking the description of the animal
itself, have exhausted all their industry in describing the habitation.
In consequence of this radical error, we have volumes written upon the
subject of shells, and very little said on the history of
shell-fish. The life of these industrious creatures, that for the
most part creep along the bottom, or immove∣ably wait till driven as the
waves happen to di∣rect, is almost entirely unknown. The wreath∣ing of their
shells, or the spots with which they are tinctured, have been described
with a most disgusting prolixity; but their appetites and their combats,
their escapes and humble arts of subsistence, have been utterly
neglected.</P>
<P>As I have only undertaken to write the hi∣story of animated
nature, the variety of shells, and their peculiar spots or blemishes, do
not come within my design. However, the manner in which shells are formed
is a part of natural history connected with my plan, as it pre-sup∣poses
vital force or industry in the animal that forms them.</P>
<P>The shell may be considered as an habitation supplied by
nature. It is an hard stony sub∣stance, made up somewhat in the manner
of a <PB N="3" REF="6"/> wall. Part of the stony substance the animal
derives from outward objects, and the fluids of the animal itself furnish
the cement. These united make that firm covering which shell-fish
generally reside in till they die.</P>
<P>But, in order to give a more exact idea of the manner in which
sea-shells are formed, we must have recourse to an animal that lives
upon land, with the formation of whose shell we are best acquainted. This
is the garden-snail, that carries its box upon its back, whose history
Swammerdam has taken such endless pains to describe. As the manner of the
formation of this animal's shell extends to that of all others that have
shells, whether they live upon land or in the water, it will be proper to
give it a place before we enter upon the history of testaceous
fishes.</P>
<P>To begin with the animal in its earliest state, and trace
the progress of its shell from the time it first appears—The
instant the young snail leaves the egg, it carries its shell or its box
no its back. It does not leave the egg till it is arrived at a certain growth,
when its little ha∣bitation is sufficiently hardened. This beginning of the
shell is not much bigger than a pin's head, but grows in a very rapid manner,
having at <PB N="4" REF="7"/> first but two circumvolutions, for the rest
are added as the snail grows larger. In proportion as the animal encreases
in size, the circumvolu∣tions of the shell encrease also, until the
number of those volutes come to be five, which is never exceeded.</P>
<P>The part where the animal enlarges its shell is at the mouth,
to which it adds in proportion as it finds itself stinted in its habitation
below. Being about to enlarge its shell, it is seen with its little teeth
biting and clearing away the scaly skin that grows at the edges. It is
some∣times seen to eat those bits it thus takes off; at other times it
only cleans away the margin when covered with films, and then adds another rim
to its shell.</P>
<P>For the purposes of making the shell, which is natural to
the animal, and without which it could not live three days, its whole body is
furnished with glands, from the orifices of which flows out a kind of slimy
fluid, like small spiders threads, which join together in one common
crust or surface, and in time con∣dense and acquire a stony hardness.
It is this slimy humour that grows into a mem∣brane and afterwards a stony
skin; nor can it have escaped any who have observed the track of a
snail; that glistening substance <PB N="5" REF="8"/> which it leaves on
the floor or the wall is no other than the materials with which the animal adds
to its shell, or repairs it when broken.</P>
<P>Now to exhibit in a more satisfactory manner the method in
which the shell is formed,—The snail bursts from its egg with its
shell upon its back; this shell, though very simple, is the center round
which every succeeding convolu∣tion of the shell is formed, by new circles
added to the first. As the body of the snail can be ex∣tended no where but
to the aperture, the mouth of the shell only can of consequence receive
augmentation. The substance of which the shell is composed is chiefly
supplied by the animal itself, and is no more than a slimy fluid which
hardens into bone. This fluid passes through an infinite number of little
glands till it arrives at the pores of the skin; but there it is stopped by
the shell that covers the part below; and therefore is sent to the mouth of
the shell, where it is wanted for its enlargement. There the first layer of
slime soon hardens; and then ano∣ther is added, which hardens also, till
in time the shell becomes as thick as is requisite for the animal's
preservation. Thus every shell may be considered as composed of a
number of layers of slime, which have entirely proceeded from the animal's
own body.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="9"/>But though this be the general opinion with
regard to the formation of shells, I cannot avoid thinking there are still
other substances beside the animal's own slime which go to the
composition of its shell, or at least to its external coat, which is ever
different from the internal. The substances I mean are the accidental
con∣cretions of earthy or saline parts, which adhere to the slimy matter
upon its first emission. By adopting this theory, we can more
satisfactorily account for the various colours of the shell, which cannot
be supposed to take its tincture from the animal's body, as is the usual
opinion; for all the internal parts of the shell are but of one white colour;
it is only the outermost layer of the shell that is so beautifully
varied, so richly tinctured with that variety of colours we behold in the
cabinets of the curious. If the external coat be scaled off, as Mr.
Argenville asserts, all the inner substance will be found but of one
simple colouring; and consequently the animal's own juices can give only
one colour; whereas we see some shells stained with an hundred.</P>
<P>The usual way of accounting for the different colouring of
shells, which seems to me erroneous, is this. In the body of every one of
these ani∣mals, several streaks are discerned of a different 
<PB N="7" REF="10"/> colour from the rest. This variety, say they, is an
incontestible proof that the juices flowing from those parts will be also
of a different hue; and will consequently tinge that part of the shell
which their slime composes of a different colour. But this system, as
was observed before, is overthrown by the fact, which discovers that only
the outer surface of the shell is tinged; whereas, by this, it would have
been coloured throughout: nay, by this system, the internal parts of the
shell would be stained with the most vivid colouring, as being least
exposed to the external injuries of the element where it is placed. But the
truth is, the animal residing in the shell has none of these various
colours thus talked of: its slime is a simple pellucid substance; and
the only marblings which ap∣pear in its body, are the colour of the food, which
is seen through its transparent intestines. We must, therefore, account
for the various colouring of its shell upon a different principle.</P>
<P>If, as I said, we examine the cabinets of the curious, we
shall find shells with various and beautiful colouring; we shall find
them gene∣rally furnished with a white ground, tinctured with red, yellow,
brown, green, and several other shades and lovely mixtures, but never blue.
Shells are of almost all colours but blue. <PB N="8" REF="11"/> The reason
seems to be obvious; for blue is the colour which sea-water changes. A
piece of silk, or a feather, of this colour, put into an in∣fusion of
salt, urine, or nitre, lose their tint entirely. Now may not this give us a
hint with respect to the operation of Nature in co∣louring her shells? May
we not from hence conclude, that sea-water is efficacious in giving colour or
taking it away? That, to produce colour, the animal not only furnishes its
juices, but the sea or the earth that mixture of substance which is to
unite with them. Neither the ani∣mal slime alone, nor the external earthy or
sa∣line substances alone, could produce colours; but both united, produce
an effect which nei∣ther separately was possessed of. Thus shells
assume every colour but blue; and that sea-water, instead of producing,
would be apt to destroy.</P>
<P>From hence, therefore, it appears, that the animal does not
alone tincture its own shell; but that external causes co-operate in
contributing to its beauty. It is probable that, from the nature of its food,
or from other circumstances unknown to us, the external layers of its slime
may be of different consistencies; so as, when joined with the particles
of earth or salt that are accidentally united with them from without, 
<PB N="9" REF="12"/> they assume various and beautiful hues. But the
internal layers, which receive no foreign ad∣mixture, still preserve the
natural colour of the animal, and continue white without any vari∣ation.</P>
<P>Thus far we see that the animal is not wholly the agent in
giving beauty and colouring to its shell: but it seems otherwise with
respect to its convolutions, its prominences, and general form. These
entirely depend upon the art of the animal; or rather upon its instincts;
which, in the same kinds, are ever invariable. The shell generally bears
some rude resemblance to the body upon which it has been moulded. Thus it
is observable in all sea-shells, that if the animal has any tumour or
excrescence on its body, it creates likewise a swelling in that part of
the incrustation to which it corresponds. When the animal begins to alter
its position, and to make new additions to its apartments, the same
protuberance which had raised the shell before in one part, swells it
again at some little distance; by which means we see the same
in∣equality, in a spiral line, all round the shell. Sometimes these
tumours of the animal are so large, or so pointed, that those which
rise over them in the incrustation, appear like horns: after this the
animal disengages itself from its <PB N="10" REF="13"/> first cavities,
and then, by fresh evacuations, assumes a new set of horns; and so
encreases the number in proportion to its growth. If, on the other hand, the
body happens to be cha∣nelled, the shell that covers it will be chanelled
likewise; if there be any protuberances in the body, which wind in a spiral
line about it, the shell will likewise have its tumours and cavities
winding round to the end.</P>
<P>In this manner, as the animals are of various forms, the
shells exhibit an equal variety. In∣deed, the diversity is so great, and
the figures and colours so very striking, that several per∣sons, with a
kind of harmless indolence, have made the arrangement of them the study and
the business of their lives. Those who consult their beauty alone, take
care to have them polished, and to have an external crust, or periosteum,
as Swammerdam calls it, scoured off from their, surfaces by spirit of
salt. But there are others that, with more learned affectation, keep them
exactly in the state in which they have been found, with their precious
crust still round them. The expence men have sometimes been at in making
such collections, is amazing; and some shells, such as the Stairs
shell or the Admiral shell, are not more pre∣cious for their
scarceness, than pearls are for <PB N="11" REF="14"/> their beauty. Indeed,
it is the scarcity, and not the beauty, of the object that determines the
value of all natural curiosities. Those shells that offer but little
beautiful to the ignorant are often the most precious; and those shells
which an unlearned spectator would stop to ob∣serve with admiration, one
accustomed to the vi∣sitation of cabinets, would pass over with
disdain. These collections, however, have their use; not only by
exhibiting the vast variety of Nature's operations, but also by exciting
our curiosity to the consideration of the animals that form them. A mind
that can find innocent entertainment in these humble contemplations is well
employed; and, as we say of children, is kept from doing mischief. Although
there may be nobler occu∣pations than that considering the convolutions of a
shell, yet there may be some who want the ambition to aspire after such
arduous pursuits; there may be some unfit for them; there may be some who
find their ambition fully gratified by the praise which the collectors of
shells bestow upon each other. Indeed, for a day or two, there is no mind
that a cabinet of shells cannot furnish with pleasing employment. What
can be more gratifying, as Pliny says<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Plin. IX.
33.</BIBL></NOTE>, than to view Nature in all her irregularities, 
<PB N="12" REF="15"/> and sporting in her variety of shells! Such a
dif∣ference of colour do they exhibit; such a dif∣ference of figure; flat,
concave, long, lunated, drawn round in a circle, the orbit cut in two; some
are seen with a rising on the back, some smooth, some wrinkled,
toothed, streaked, the point variously intorted, the mouth pointing like a
dagger, folded back, bent inwards: all these variations, and many more,
furnish at once novelty, elegance, and speculation.</P>
<P>With respect to the figure of shells, Aristotle has
divided them into three kinds; and his method is, of all others, the most
conformable to nature. These are, first, the Univalve, or Turbinated, which
consist of one piece, like the box of a snail; secondly, the Bivalve,
consisting of two pieces, united by a hinge, like an oyster; and thirdly,
the Multivalve, consisting of more than two pieces, as the acorn-shell,
which has not less than twelve pieces that go to its composition. All
these kinds are found in the sea at different depths; and are valuable in
proportion to their scarceness or beauty.</P>
<P>From the variety of the colours and figure of shells, we may
pass to that of their place and situation. Some are found in the sea;
some in fresh-water rivers; some alive upon land; and a still greater
quantity dead in the bowels of the <PB N="13" REF="16"/> earth; But wherever
shells are found, they are universally known to be composed of one and
the same substance. They are formed of an ani∣mal or calcarious earth,
that ferments with vi∣negar and other acids, and that burns into lime, and will
not easily melt into glass. Such is the substance of which they are
composed; and of their spoils, many philosophers think that a great part
of the surface of the earth is composed at present. It is supposed by
them, that chalks, marles, and all such earths as fer∣ment with vinegar, are
nothing more than a composition of shells, decayed, and crumbled down to
one uniform mass.</P>
<P>Sea-shells are either found in the depths of the ocean, or
they are cast empty and forsaken of their animals upon shore. Those
which are fished up from the deep, are called by the Latin name Pelagii;
those that are cast upon shore, are called Littorales. Many of the
pelagii are never seen upon shore; they continue in the depths where they
are bred; and we owe their capture only to accident. These, there∣fore, are
the most scarce shells; and conse∣quently, the most valuable. The
littorales are more frequent; and such as are of the same kind with the
pelagii are not so beautiful. As they are often empty and forsaken, and as 
<PB N="14" REF="17"/> their animal is dead and perhaps putrid in the bottom of
the shell, they by this means lose the whiteness and the brilliancy of
their colouring. They are not unfrequently also found eaten through, either
by worms, or by each other; and they are thus rendered less valuable: but
what decreases their price still more is, when they are scaled and worn
by lying too long empty at the bottom, or exposed upon the shore. Upon the
whole, however, sea-shells exceed either land or fossil shells in
beauty; they receive the highest polish, and exhibit the most brilliant
and various colouring.</P>
<P>Fresh-water shells are neither so numerous, so various,
or so beautiful as those belonging to the sea. They want that solidity
which the others have: their clavicle, as it is called, is neither so
prominent nor so strong; and not having a saline substance to tinge
the surface of the shell, the colours are obscure. In fresh-water there
are but two kinds of shells; namely, the bivalved and the turbinated.</P>
<P>Living land shells are more beautiful, though not so various
as those of fresh-water; and some not inferior to sea shells in
beauty. They are indeed but of one kind, namely, the turbinated; but in that
there are found four or five very beautiful varieties.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="18"/>Of fossil, or, as they are called,
<HI>extraneous</HI> shells, found in the bowels of the earth, there are great
numbers, and as great a variety. In this class there are as many kinds as in
the sea itself. There are found the turbinated, the bi∣valve, and the
multivalve kinds; and of all these, many at present not to be found even in
the ocean. Indeed, the number is so great, and the varieties so many, that
it was long the opinion of naturalists, that they were merely the capricious
productions of Nature, and had never given retreat to animals whose
habitations they resembled. They were found, not only of various kinds, but
in different states of pre∣servation: some had the shell entire,
composed, as in its primitive state, of a white calcarious earth, and
filled with earth, or even empty; others were found with the shell entire,
but filled with a substance which was petrified by time; others, and
these in great numbers, were found with the shell entirely mouldered away,
but the petrified substance that filled it still exhibiting the figure of
the shell; others still, that had been lodged near earth or stone,
impressed their print upon these substances, and left the
impression, though they themselves were de∣cayed: lastly, some
shells were found half moul∣dered away, their parts scaling off from each 
<PB N="16" REF="19"/> other in the same order in which they were ori∣ginally
formed. However, these different stages of the shell, and even their
fermenting with acids, were at first insufficient to convince those who
had before assigned them a different origin. They were still considered
as accidentally and sportively formed, and deposited in the various
repositories where they were found, but no way appertaining to any part of
animated nature. This put succeeding enquirers upon more minute researches;
and they soon began to find, that often where they dug up petrified shells
or teeth, they could discover the petrified remains of some other bony
parts of the body. They found that the shells which were taken from the
earth, exhibited, the usual defects and mis∣chances, which the same kind
are known to receive at sea. They shewed them not only tinctured with a
salt water crust, but pierced in a peculiar manner by the sea worms, that
make the shells of fishes their favourite food. These demonstrations
were sufficient at last to convince all but a few philosophers who died
away, and whose erroneous systems died with them.</P>
<P>Every shell, therefore, wherever it is found, is now
considered as the spoil of some animal, that once found shelter
therein. It matters not by what unaccountable means they may 
<PB N="17" REF="20"/> have wandered from the sea; but they ex∣hibit all, and
the most certain marks of their origin. From their numbers and situation,
we are led to conjecture, that the sea reached the places where they are
found; and from their varieties we learn how little we know of all the sea
contains at present; as the earth furnishes many kinds which our most
exact and industrious shell-collectors have not been able to fish up from
the deep. It is most probable, that thousands o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> different forms still remain at the
bottom un∣known; so that we may justly say with the phi∣losopher: 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>Ea quae scimus sunt pars minima eorum
quae ignoramus.</HI></Q></P>
<P>It is well, however, for mankind, that the defect of our
knowledge on this subject is, of all parts of learning, that which may be
most easily dispensed with. An encrease in the number of shells,
would throw but very few lights upon the history of the animals that inhabit
them. For such information we are obliged to those men who contemplated
something more than the outside of the objects before them. To Reaumur we
are obliged for examining the manners of some with accuracy; but to
Swam∣merdam for more. In fact, this Dutchman has lent an attention to those
animals, that almost exceeds credibility: he has excelled even the 
<PB N="18" REF="21"/> insects he dissected, in patience, industry, and
perseverance. It was in vain that this poor man's father dissuaded him
from what the world considered as a barren pursuit; it was in vain that an
habitual disorder, brought on by his application, interrupted his efforts; it
was in vain that mankind treated him with ridicule while living, as they
suffered his works to remain long unprinted and neglected when dead: still
the Dutch philosopher went on, peeping into unwholsome ditches, wading
through fens, dissecting spiders, and enume∣rating the blood-vessels
of a snail: like the bee, whose heart he could not only distinguish,
but dissect, he seemed instinctively impelled by his ruling
passion, although he found nothing but ingratitude from man, and though his
in∣dustry was apparently becoming fatal to him∣self. From him I will take
some of the leading features in the history of those animals which breed
in shells; previously taking my division from Aristotle, who, as was
said above, divides them into three classes: the Turbinated, or those
of the Snail Kind; the Bivalved, or those of the Oyster Kind; and the
Multivalved, or those of the A corn-shell Kind. Of each I will treat in
distinct chapters.</P>

<P><PB N="19" REF="23"/> TO conceive the manner in which those
ani∣mals subsist that are hid from us at the bottom of the deep, we
must again have recourse to one of a similar nature and formation, that
we know. The history of the garden-snail has been more copiously
considered than that of the ele∣phant; and its anatomy is as well, if not
better known: however, not to give any one object more room in the general
picture of Nature than it is entitled to, it will be sufficient to
ob∣serve, that the snail is surprizingly fitted for the life it is formed
to lead. It is furnished with the organs of life in a manner almost as
com∣plete as the largest animal; with a tongue, brain, salival ducts,
glands, nerves, stomach and in∣testines; liver, heart and
blood-vessels: besides this, it has a purple bag that furnishes a red
matter to different parts of the body, together with strong muscles that
hold it to the shell, and which are hardened, like tendons, at their
insertion.</P>
<P>But these it possesses in common with other animals.
We must now see what it has peculiar <PB N="20" REF="24"/> to itself. The
first striking peculiarity is, that the animal has got its eyes on the
points of its largest horns. When the snail is in motion, four horns are
distinctly seen; but the two up∣permost and longest deserve peculiar
consi∣deration, both on account of the various mo∣tions with which they are
endued, as well as their having their eyes fixed at the extreme ends of them.
These appear like two blackish points at their ends. When considered as
taken out of the body, they are of a bulbous or tur∣nip-like figure; they have
but one coat; and the three humours which are common in the eyes of other
animals, namely, the vitreous, the aqueous and the chrystalline, are in
these very indistinctly seen. The eyes the animal can direct to different
objects at pleasure, by a regular motion out of the body; and some∣times it
hides them, by a very swift con∣traction into the belly. Under the small
horns is the animal's mouth; and though it may ap∣pear too soft a
substance to be furnished with teeth, yet it has not less than eight of
them, with which it devours leaves, and other sub∣stances, seemingly
harder than itself; and with which it sometimes bites off pieces of its own
shell.</P>
<P>But what is most surprizing in the formation of this animal,
are the parts that serve for ge∣neration. <PB N="21" REF="25"/> Every snail
is at once male and female; and while it impregnates another, is itself
impregnated in turn. The vessels sup∣plying the fluid for this purpose,
are placed chiefly in the fore part of the neck, and extend themselves over
the body; but the male and female organs of generation, are always found
united, and growing together. There is a large opening on the right side of
the neck, which serves for very different purposes. As an anus it gives a
passage to the excrements; as a mouth it serves for an opening for
respiration; and also as an organ of generation, it dilates when the
desire of propagation begins. Within this each animal has those parts, or
something similar thereto, which continue the kind.</P>
<P>For some days before coition, the snails gather together,
and lie quiet near each other, eating very little in the mean time; but they
settle their bodies in such a posture, that the neck and head are placed
upright. In the mean time, the apertures on the side of the neck being
greatly dilated, two organs, resem∣bling intestines, are seen issuing
from them, which some have thought to be the instruments of generation.
Beside the protrusion of these, each animal is possessed of
another peculiarity; for, from the same aperture, they launch forth 
<PB N="22" REF="26"/> a kind of dart at each other, which is pretty hard,
barbed, and ending in a very sharp point. This is performed when the
apertures approach each other; and then the one is seen to shoot its
weapon, which is received by the other, though it sometimes falls to the
ground: some minutes after, the snail which received the weapon, darts one
of its own at its antagonist, which is received in like manner. They then
softly ap∣proach still nearer, and apply their bodies one to the other, as
closely as the palms and fingers of the hands, when grasped together. At
that time the horns are seen variously moving in all directions; and this
sometimes for three days together. The coupling of these animals is
generally thrice repeated, at intervals of fif∣teen days each; and, at every
time, a new dart is mutually emitted.</P>
<P>At the expiration of eighteen days, the snails produce their
eggs, at the opening of the neck, and hide them in the earth with the
greatest solicitude and industry. These eggs are in great numbers,
round, white, and covered with a soft shell: they are also stuck to
each other by an imperceptible slime, like a bunch of grapes, of about the
size of a small pea.</P>
<P>When the animal leaves the egg, it is seen with a very small
shell on its back, which has but one convolution; but in proportion as it 
<PB N="23" REF="27"/> grows, the shell encreases in the number of its
circles. The shell always receives its additions at the mouth; the first
centre still remaining: the animal sending forth from its body that slime
which hardens into a stony substance, and still is fashioned into
similar volutions. The garden snail seldom exceeds four rounds and an
half; but some of the sea snails arrive even at ten.</P>
<P>The snail, thus fitted with its box, which is light and firm,
finds itself defended in a very ample manner from all external injury.
When∣ever it is invaded, it is but retiring into this fortress, and waiting
patiently till the danger is over. Nor is it possessed only of a power
of retreating into its shell; but of mending it when broken. Sometimes
these animals are crushed seemingly to pieces; and, to all appearance,
utterly destroyed: yet still they set themselves to work, and, in a few
days, mend all their numerous breaches. The same substance by which the
shell is originally made, goes to the re-establishment of the ruined
habitation. But all the junctures are very easily seen, for they have a
fresher colour than the rest, and the whole shell in some measure
resembles an old coat, patched with new pieces. They are sometimes seen
with eight or ten of these patches; so that <PB N="24" REF="28"/> the damage
must have been apparently irrepa∣rable. Still, however, though the animal is
possessed of the power of mending its shell, it cannot, when come to
its full growth, make a new one. Swammerdam tried the experiment: he stripped
a snail of its shell, without hurting any of the blood-vessels,
retaining that part of the shell where the muscles were inserted; but it
died in three days after it was stripped of its covering: not, however,
without making efforts to build up a new shell; for, before its death, it
pressed out a certain membrane round the whole surface of its body. This
membrane was entirely of the shelly nature; and was intended, by the animal,
as a supply towards a new one.</P>
<P>As the snail is furnished with all the organs of life and
sensation, it is not wonderful to see it very voracious. It chiefly
subsists upon the leaves of plants and trees; but is very delicate in its
choice. When the animal moves to seek its food, it goes forward by means of
that broad muscular skin which sometimes is seen pro∣jecting round the
mouth of the shell; this is expanded before, and then contracted with a kind
of undulating motion, like a man at∣tempting to move himself forward by one
arm, while lying on his belly. But the snail has ano∣ther advantage, by which
it not only smooths and planes its way, but also can ascend in the 
<PB N="25" REF="29"/> most perpendicular direction. This is by that slimy
substance with which it is so copiously fur∣nished, and which it
emits wherever it moves. Upon this slime, as upon a kind of carpet, it
proceeds slowly along, without any danger of wounding its tender body
against the asperities of the pavement; by means of this it moves upwards
to its food upon trees; and by this descends, without danger of falling, and
breaking its shell by the shock.</P>
<P>The appetite of these animals is very great; and the damage
gardeners in particular sustain from them, makes them employ every method
for their destruction. Salt will destroy them, as well as soot; but a
tortoise in a garden, is said to banish them much more effectually.</P>
<P>At the approach of winter, the snail buries itself in the
earth; or retires to some hole, to continue in a torpid state, during the
severity of the season. It is sometimes seen alone; but more
frequently in company in its retreat; several being usually found together,
appa∣rently deprived of life and sensation. For the purposes of
continuing in greater warmth and security, the snail forms a cover or lid
to the mouth of its shell with its slime, which stops it up entirely, and
thus protects it from every external danger. The matter of <PB N="26" REF="30"/>
which the cover is composed, is whitish, some∣what like plaister,
pretty hard and solid, yet at the same time porous and thin, to admit air,
which the animal cannot live without. When the cover is formed too thick, the
snail then breaks a little hole in it, which corrects the de∣fect of that
closeness, which proceeded from too much caution. In this manner,
sheltered in its hole from the weather, defended in its shell by a cover,
it sleeps during the winter; and, for six or seven months, continues
without food or motion, until the genial call of spring breaks its slumber,
and excites its activity.</P>
<P>The snail, having slept for so long a season, wakes
one of the first fine days of April; breaks open its cell, and sallies
forth to seek for nou∣rishment. It is not surprizing that so long a
fast should have thinned it, and rendered it very voracious. At first,
therefore, it is not very difficult in the choice of its food; almost any
vegetable that is green, seems welcome; but the succulent plants of the
garden are chiefly grateful; and the various kind of pulse are, at some
seasons, almost wholly destroyed by their numbers. So great is the
multiplication of snails at some years, that gardeners imagine they burst
from the earth. A wet season is generally fa∣vourable to their production;
for this animal <PB N="27" REF="31"/> cannot bear very dry seasons, or dry
places, as they cause too great a consumption of its slime, without
plenty of which it cannot subsist in health and vigour.</P>
<P>Such are the most striking particulars in the history of
this animal; and this may serve as a general picture, to which the manners
and ha∣bitudes of the other tribes of this class may be compared and
referred. These are, the sea snail, of which naturalists have, from the
apparent dif∣ference of their shells, mentioned fifteen kinds<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>D'Argenville's Conchyoligie.</BIBL></NOTE>; the
fresh-water snail, of which there are eight kinds; and the land-snail, of
which there are five. These all bear a strong resemblance to the garden
snail, in the formation of their shell, in their hermaphrodite natures, in
the slimy substance with which they are covered, in the formation of
their intestines, and the disposition of the hole on the right side of
the neck, which serves at once for the discharge of the faeces, for the
lodging the instruments of generation, and for respiration, when the animal
is under a necessity of taking in a new supply.</P>
<P>But in Nature, no two kinds of animals, however like each other
in figure or conform∣ation, are of manners entirely the same. Though the
common garden snail bears a very strong <PB N="28" REF="32"/> resemblance
to that of fresh-water, and that of the sea, yet there are differences to
be found, and those very considerable ones.</P>
<P>If we compare them with the fresh-water snail, though we
shall find a general resemblance, yet there are one or two remarkable
distinctions: and first, the fresh-water snail, and, as I should
suppose, all snails that live in water, are pecu∣liarly furnished with
a contrivance by Nature, for rising to the surface, or sinking to the
bot∣tom. The manner in which this is performed, is by opening and shutting
the orifice on the right side of the neck, which is furnished with
muscles for that purpose. The snail sometimes gathers this aperture
into an oblong tube, and stretches or portends it above the surface of the
water, in order to draw in or expel the air, as it finds occasion. This may
not only be seen, but heard also by the noise which the snail makes in
moving the water. By dilating this it rises; by compressing it, the
animal sinks to the bot∣tom. This is effected somewhat in the manner in
which little images of glass are made to rise or sink in water, by
pressing the air contained at the mouth of the tubes, so that it shall
drive the water into their hollow bodies, which before were filled only with
air, and thus make them heavier than the element in which they swim. 
<PB N="29" REF="33"/> In this manner does the fresh-water snail dive or
swim, by properly managing the air con∣tained in its body.</P>
<P>But what renders these animals far more worthy of notice is,
that they are viviparous, and bring forth their young not only alive, but with
their shells upon their backs. This seems surprizing; yet it is
incontestably true: the young come to some degree of perfection in the womb
of the parent; there they receive their stony coat; and from thence are
excluded, with a complete apparatus for subsistence.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">"On the twelfth of March," says Swam∣merdam,
"I began my observations upon this snail, and collected a great number of
the kind, which I put into a large bason filled with rain-water, and fed for
a long time with pot∣ter's earth, dissolved in the water about them. On the
thirteenth of the same month I opened one of these snails, when I found
nine living snails in its womb: the largest of these were placed
foremost, as the first candidates for exclusion. I put them into
fresh-water, and they lived to the eighteenth of the same month, moving and
swimming, like snails full grown: nay their manner of swimming was much
more beautiful."</Q> Thus, at what∣ever time of the year these snails are
opened, <PB N="30" REF="34"/> they are sound pregnant with eggs, or with
living snails; or with both together.</P>
<P>This striking difference between the fresh-water and the
garden snail, obtains also in some of the sea kind; among which there
are some that are found viviparous, while others lay eggs in the usual
manner. Of this kind are one or two of the Buccinums; within which living young
have been frequently found, upon their dissection. In general, however, the
rest of this numerous class bring forth eggs; from whence the animal
bursts at a proper state of maturity, completely equipped with an house,
which the moistness of the element where it resides does not prevent the
inhabitant from enlarging. How the soft slime of the snail hardens, at
the bottom of the sea, into the stony substance of a shell, is not
easy to conceive! This slime must at least be possessed of very
powerful petrifying powers.</P>
<P>All animals of the snail kind, as was ob∣served before, are
hermaphrodites; each con∣taining the instruments of generation double. But
some of the sea kinds copulate in a different manner from those of the
garden. The one im∣pregnates the other; but, from the position of the parts,
is incapable of being impregnated by the same in turn. For this reason it
is ne∣cessary <PB N="31" REF="35"/> for a third to be admitted as a partner
in this operation: so that, while one impreg∣nates that before it, another
does the same office by this; which is itself impregnated by a fourth. In
this manner, Mr. Adanson has seen vast numbers of sea snails, united
to∣gether in a chain, impregnating each other. The <HI>bulin</HI> and the
<HI>coret</HI> perform the offices of male and female at the same time. The
orifices in these are two, both separate from each other: the opening by
which the animal performs the office of the male, being at the origin of the
horns; that by which it is passive, as the female, being farther down upon
the neck. It may also be observed as a general rule, that all animals that
have this orifice, or verge, as some call it, on the right side, have their
shells turned from the right to the left; on the contrary, those which have
it on the left side, have their shells turned from left to right, in a
contrary direction to the former.</P>
<P>But this is not the only difference between land and sea
snails. Many of the latter en∣tirely want horns; and none of them have above
two. Indeed, if the horns of snails be fur∣nished with eyes, and if, as
some are willing to think, the length of the horn, like the tube of a
telescope, assists vision, these animals, that <PB N="32" REF="36"/>
chiefly reside in the gloomy bottom of the deep, can have no great occasion
for them. Eyes would be unnecessary to creatures whose food is usually
concealed in the darkest places; and who, possessed of very little
motion, are obliged to grope for what they subsist on. To such, I
say, eyes would rather be an obstruction than an advantage; and perhaps
even those that live upon land are without them!</P>
<P>Those that have seen the shells of sea snails, need
not be told that the animal which produces them is larger than those of the
same denomi∣nation upon land. The sea seems to have the property of
enlarging the magnitude of all its inhabitants; and the same proportion that
a trout bears to a shark, is often seen to obtain between a shell bred
upon the land, and one bred in the ocean. Its convolutions are more numerous.
The garden snail has but five turns at the most; in the sea snail the
convolutions are sometimes seen amounting to ten.</P>
<P>There is a difference also in the position of the mouth, in
the garden and the water snail. In the former, the mouth is placed
crosswise, as in quadrupedes; furnished with jaw-bones, lips and teeth.
In most of the sea snails, the mouth is placed longitudinally in the
head; <PB N="33" REF="37"/> and, in some, obliquely, or on one side. Others,
of the Trochus kind, have no mouth whatsoever; but are furnished with a
trunk, very long in some kinds, and shorter in others.</P>
<P>Snails of the Trochus kind, furnished thus with an
instrument of offence, deserve our par∣ticular attention. The trunk of the
Trochus is fleshy, muscular, supple, and hollow. Its extremity is
bordered with a cartilage, and toothed like a saw. The snails that are
pro∣vided with this, may be considered as the pre∣dacious tribe, among their
fellows of the bottom. They are, among snails, what the tiger, the eagle or
the shark is among beasts, birds or fishes. The whole race of shelled
animals avoid their approach; for their habitations, however powerfully and
strongly built, though never so well fortified, yield to the superior
force of these invaders. Though provided with a thick clumsy shell
themselves, yet they move with greater swiftness at the bottom than
most other shell fish; and seize their prey with greater facility. No
shell so large but they will boldly venture to attack; and, with their
piercing augre-like trunk, will quickly bore it through. No efforts the other
animal makes can avail: it expands itself, and rises to the surface; but
the enemy rises with it: it again sinks to the <PB N="34" REF="38"/> bottom,
but still its destroyer closely adheres. In this manner the carnivorous
shell-fish, as some naturalists call it, sticks for several days,
nay weeks, to its prey, until, with its trunk, it has sucked out all
substance, or until it drops off when the other begins to putrefy.</P>
<P>Thus it would seem throughout nature, that no animal is so
well defended, but that others are found capable of breaking in upon its
entrenchments. The garden snail seems tolerably well guarded; but the wall
of its shell is paper itself, in comparison with that which fortifies
some of the sea snail kind. Beside this thick shell, many of them are
also furnished with a lid, which covers the mouth of the shell, and which
opens and shuts at the animal's pleasure. When the creature hunts for food,
it opens its box, gropes or swims about; and, when satisfied, drops its lid
and sinks to the bottom: there it might be supposed to remain in perfect
security; but the trochus soon finds the way to break into the thickest
part of its enclosure, and quickly destroys it with the most fatal
industry.</P>
<P>The being liable to the attacks of the trochus seems to be a
calamity to which most of this tribe are subject. Scarce a shell is met
with entire and sound to the end of its convolutions; but particularly the
thinnest shells are the most <PB N="35" REF="39"/> subject to be thus
invaded. As their shells are easily pierced, the predatory shell-fish,
or the sea-worm, chiefly seek them for subsistence; and of those
thin paper-like shells, not one in an hundred is found that has not
suffered some disaster. As they are lighter than other shell-fish,
they swim with greater ease; and this is the chief method of avoiding their
heavier thick shelled pursuers. The food of all snails properly lies at
the bottom; when, therefore, the nau∣tilus, or other thin shelled fish, are
seen busily swimming at the surface, it may be, that, instead of
sporting or sunning themselves, as some are apt to suppose, they
are actually labour∣ing to escape their most deadly pursuers.</P>
<P>Of all sea snails, that which is most frequently seen
swimming upon the surface, and whose shell is the thinnest and most
easily pierced, is the Nautilus. Whether, upon these occasions, it is
employed in escaping its numerous enemies at the bottom, or seeking for
food at the sur∣face, I will not venture to decide. It seems most
probable, that the former is the cause of its frequently appearing; for, upon
opening the stomach, it is found to contain chiefly that food which it finds
at the bottom. This ani∣mal's industry, therefore, may be owing to its 
<PB N="36" REF="40"/> fears; and all those arts of sailing, which it has
taught mankind, may have been originally the product of necessity. But the
nautilus is too fa∣mous not to demand a more ample description.</P>
<P>Although there be several species of the nau∣tilus, yet they
all may be divided into two: the one with a white shell, as thin as paper,
which it often is seen to quit, and again to resume; the other with a
thicker shell, some∣times of a beautiful mother-of-pearl colour, and that
quits its shell but rarely. This shell out∣wardly resembles that of a
large snail, but is generally six or eight inches across: within, it is
divided into forty partitions, that commu∣nicate with each other by doors, if I
may so call them, through which one could not thrust a goose-quill:
almost the whole internal part of the shell is filled by the animal; the
body of which, like its habitation, is divided into as many parts as there are
chambers in its shell: all the parts of its body communicate with each other,
through the doors or openings, by a long blood-vessel, which runs from the
head to the tail: thus the body of the animal, if taken out of the shell, may
be likened to a number of soft bits of flesh, of which there are forty,
threaded upon a string. From this extraordinary conformation, one would not
be apt to suppose <PB N="37" REF="41"/> that the nautilus sometimes
quitted its shell, and returned to it again; yet nothing, though seemingly
more impossible, is more certain. The manner by which it contrives to
disengage every part of its body from so intricate an ha∣bitation; by which
it makes a substance, to ap∣pearance as thick as one's wrist, pass
through forty doors, each of which would scarcely admit a goose-quill, is
not yet discovered: but the fact is certain; for the animal is often found
without its shell; and the shell more frequently destitute of the animal.
It is most probable, that it has a power of making the substance of one
section of its body remove up into that which is next; and thus, by
multiplied removals, it gets free.</P>
<P>But this, though very strange, is not the pe∣culiarity for
which the nautilus has been the most distinguished. Its spreading the
thin oar, and catching the flying gale, to use the poet's description of
it, has chiefly excited human cu∣riosity. These animals, particularly
those of the white, light kind, are chiefly found in the Me∣diterranean; and
scarce any who have sailed on that sea, but must often have seen
them. When the sea is calm, they are observed floating on the surface;
some spreading their little sail; <PB N="38" REF="42"/> some rowing with
their feet, as if for life and death; and others still, floating upon their
mouths, like a ship with the keel upward. If taken while thus employed, and
examined, the extraordinary mechanism of their limbs for sailing will
appear more manifest. The nau∣tilus is furnished with eight feet, which
issue near the mouth, and may as properly be called barbs: these are
connected to each other by a thin skin, like that between the toes of a duck,
but much thinner and more transparent. Of these eight feet thus connected,
six are short, and these are held up as sails to catch the wind in
sailing: the two others are longer, and are kept in the water; serving,
like paddles, to steer their course by. When the weather is quite calm, and
the animal is pursued from below, it is then seen expanding only a part of
its sail, and rowing with the rest: whenever it is inter∣rupted, or fears
danger from above, it instantly furls the sail, catches in all its oars,
turns its shell mouth downward, and instantly sinks to the bottom.
Sometimes also it is seen pumping the water from its leaking hulk; and,
when unfit for sailing, deserts its shell entirely. The forsaken hulk
is seen floating along, till it dashes, by a kind of shipwreck, upon the
rocks or the shore.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="43"/>From the above description, I think we may
con∣sider this animal rather as attempting to save itself from the
attacks of its destroyers, than as rowing in pursuit of food. Certain it
is, that no creature of the deep has more numerous and more powerful enemies.
Its shell is scarcely ever found in perfect preservation; but is
generally seen to bear some marks of hostile invasion. Its little arts,
therefore, upon the surface of the water, may have been given it for
pro∣tection; and it may be thus endued with com∣parative swiftness, to
avoid the crab, the sea-scorpion, the trochus, and all the slower
pre∣dacious reptiles that lurk for it at the bottom of the water.</P>
<P>From this general view of snails, they appear to be a much
more active, animated tribe, than from their figure one would at first
con∣ceive. They seem, to an inattentive spectator, as mere inert masses
of soft flesh, rather loaded than covered with a shell, scarcely
capable of motion, and insensible to all the objects around them. When
viewed more closely, they are found to be furnished with the organs of life
and sensation in tolerable perfection: they are de∣fended with armour, that
is at once both light and strong; they are as active as their necessities
<PB N="40" REF="44"/> require; and are possessed of appetites more
poignant than those of animals that seem much more perfectly formed. In
short, they are a fruitful industrious tribe; furnished, like all other
animals, with the powers of escape and invasion; they have their pursuits
and their enmities; and, of all creatures of the deep, they have most to fear
from each other.</P>

<PB N="41" REF="45"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. III. Of Bivalved Shell-Fish, or Shells of the
Oyster Kind.</HEAD>
<P>IT may seem whimsical to make a distinction between the
animal perfections of turbinated and bivalved shell-fish, or to grant a
degree of su∣periority to the snail above the oyster. Yet this
distinction strongly and apparently obtains in nature; and we shall find
the bivalved tribe of animals in every respect inferior to those we have
been describing. Inferior in all their sen∣sations; inferior in their
powers of motion; but particularly inferior in their system of animal
generation. The snail tribe, as we saw, are hermaphrodite, but require the
assistance of each other for fecundation; all the bivalve tribe are
hermaphrodite in like manner, but they require no assistance from each
other towards impregnation; and a single muscle or oyster, if there were
no other in the world, would quickly replenish the ocean. As the land snail
from its being best known took the lead in the former class, so the
fresh-water muscle, for the same reason, may take lead in this. The
life and manners of such as belong to the sea will be best displayed in
the comparison.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="46"/>The muscle, as is well known, whether
be∣longing to fresh or salt-water, consists of two equal shells,
joined at the back by a strong muscular ligament that answers all the
purposes of an hinge. By the elastic contraction of these, the animal can
open its shells at pleasure, about a quarter of an inch from each other.
The fish is fixed to either shell by four tendons, by means of which it
shuts them close, and keeps its body firm from being crushed by any
shock against the walls of its own habitation. It is furnished, like all
other animals of this kind, with vital organs, though these are situated in
a very extraordinary manner. It has a mouth furnished with two fleshy lips;
its intestine begins at the bottom of the mouth, passes through the
brain, and makes a number of cir∣cumvolutions through the liver; on leaving
this organ, it goes on straight into the heart, which it penetrates, and ends
in the anus; near which the lungs are placed, and through which it breathes,
like those of the snail kind; and in this manner its languid circulation is
carried on<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>M. Mery. Anat. de Moule's
d'Etang.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P>But the organs of generation are what most deserve to excite
our curiosity. These consist in each muscle of two ovaries, which are
the fe∣male part of its furniture, and of two seminal <PB N="43" REF="47"/>
vessels resembling what are found in the male. Each ovary and each
seminal vessel has its own proper canal; by the ovary canal the eggs
de∣scend to the anus; and there also the seminal canals send their
fluids to impregnate them. By this contrivance, one single animal suffices
for the double purposes of generation; and the eggs are excluded and
impregnated by itself alone.</P>
<P>As the muscle is thus furnished with a kind of
self-creating power, there are few places where it breeds that it is not
found in great abundance. The ovaries usually empty them∣selves of their
eggs in spring, and they are re∣plenished in autumn. For this reason they
are found empty in summer and full in winter. They produce in great numbers,
as all bivalved shell-fish are found to do. The fecundity of the snail
kind is trifling in comparison to the fertility of these. Indeed it may be
asserted as a general rule in nature, that the more helpless and
contemptible the animal, the more prolific it is always found. Thus all
creatures that are in∣capable of resisting their destroyers, have nothing
but their quick multiplication, for the conti∣nuation of their existence.</P>
<P>The multitude of these animals in some places is very great;
but, from their defencelefs state, <PB N="44" REF="48"/> the number of their
destroyers are in equal proportion. The crab, the cray-fish, and many other
animals, are seen to devour them; but the trochus is their most formidable
enemy. When their shells are found deserted, if we then observe
closely, it is most probable we shall find that the trochus has been at
work in piercing them. There is scarce one of them without a hole in it; and
this probably was the avenue by which the enemy entered to destroy the
inhabitant.</P>
<P>But notwithstanding the number of this crea∣ture's animated
enemies, it seems still more fearful of the agitations of the element in
which it resides; for if dashed against rocks, or thrown far on the
beach, it is destroyed without a power of redress. In order to guard
against these, which are to this animal the commonest and the most
fatal accidents, although it has a power of slow motion, which I shall
presently describe, yet it endeavours to become stationary, and to attach
itself to any fixed object it happens to be near. For this purpose it is
furnished with a very singular capacity of binding itself by a number of
threads to whatever object it approaches; and these Reaumur supposed it
spun artificially, as spiders their webs which they fasten against a
wall. Of this however, latter <PB N="45" REF="49"/> philosophers have found
very great reason to doubt. It is therefore supposed that these
threads, which are usually called the beard of the muscle, are the natural
growth of the animal's body, and by no means produced at pleasure. Indeed,
the extreme length of this beard in some, which far exceeds the length of the
body, seems impossible to be manufactured by the thrusting out and
drawing in of the tongue, with the glutinous matter of which the French
philosopher supposed those threads were form∣ed. It is even found to
encrease with the growth of the animal; and as the muscle be∣comes larger
and older, the beard becomes longer and its filaments more strong<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Mercier du Paty, sur le bouchots a moules. Tom. ii. de
l'Academie de la Rochelle.</BIBL></NOTE>. Be this as it will, nothing is more
certain than that the muscle is found attached by these threads to every
fixed object; sometimes, indeed, for want of such an object, these
animals are found united to each other; and though thrown into a lake
separately, they are taken out in bunches of many together.</P>
<P>To have some fixed resting place where the muscle can
continue, and take in its accidental food, seems the state that this animal
chiefly desires. Its instrument of motion, by which <PB N="46" REF="50"/> it
contrives to reach the object it wants to bind itself to, is that muscular
substance resembling a tongue, which is found long in proportion to the
size of the muscle. In some it is two inches long, in others not a third
part of these dimen∣sions. This the animal has a power of thrusting out
of its shell; and with this it is capable of making a slight furrow in the
sand at the bottom. By means of this furrow it can erect itself upon the
edge of its shell; and thus continuing to make the furrow in proportion as it
goes for∣ward, it reaches out its tongue, that answers the purpose of an
arm, and thus carries its shell edge-ways, as in a grove, until it reaches
the point intended. There where it determines to take up its residence it
fixes the ends of its beard, which are glutinous, to the rock or the object,
whatever it be; and thus, like a ship at anchor, braves all the agitations of
the water. Sometimes the animal is attached by a large number of threads;
sometimes but by three or four, that seem scarce able to retain it. When
the muscle is fixed in this manner, it lives upon the little earthy particles
that the water trans∣ports to its shells, and perhaps the flesh of the
most diminutive animals. However, it does not fail to grow considerably;
and some of this kind have been found a foot long. I have seen 
<PB N="47" REF="51"/> the beards a foot and an half; and of this sub∣stance
the natives of Palermo sometimes make gloves and stockings.</P>
<P>These shell-fish are found in lakes, rivers, and in the
sea. Those of the lake often grow to a very large size; but they seem a
solitary animal, and are found generally separate from each other. Those
of rivers are not so large, but yet in greater abundance; but the sea
muscle of all others is perhaps the most plenty. These are often bred
artificially in salt-water marshes that are overflowed by the tide; the
fishermen throwing them in at the proper seasons; and there being
undisturbed by the agitations of the sea, and not preyed upon by their
powerful enemies at the bottom, they cast their eggs, which soon become
perfect animals, and these are generally found in clusters of several
dozen together. It requires a year for the peopling a muscle-bed; so that,
if the number consists of forty thousand, a tenth part may annually be
left for the peopling the bed anew. Muscles are taken from their beds from
the month of July to October; and they are sold at a very moderate price.</P>
<P>From this animal the oyster differs very little, except in the
thickness of its shell, and its greater imbecility. The oyster, like the
muscle, <PB N="48" REF="52"/> is formed with organs of life and respiration,
with intestines which are very voluminous, a liver, lungs, and heart. Like
the muscle, it is self-impregnated; and the shell, which the animal
soon acquires, serves it for its future habitation. Like the muscle, it
opens its shell to receive the influx of water; and like that animal is
strongly attached to its shells both above and below.</P>
<P>But it differs in many particulars. In the first place its
shells are not equal, the one being cupped, the other flat; upon the cupped
shell it is always seen to rest; for if it lay upon the flat side it
would then lose all its water. It differs also in the thickness of its
shells, which are so strongly lined and defended, that no animal will
attempt to pierce them. But though the oyster be secured from the attacks
of the small reptiles at the bottom, yet it often serves as an object to
which they are attached. Pipe∣worms and other little animals fix their
habi∣tation to the oyster's sides, and in this manner continue to live in
security. Among the number of these is a little red worm, that is often
found upon the shell; which some, from never seeing oysters copulate,
erroneously supposed to be the male by which their spawn was
impregnated.</P>
<P>The oyster differs also from the muscle in 
<PB N="49" REF="53"/> being utterly unable to change its situation. The
muscle, as we have observed, is capable of erecting itself on an edge,
and going forward with a slow laborious motion. The oyster is wholly
passive, and endeavours by all its powers to rest fixed to one spot at
the bottom. It is entirely without that tongue which we saw an∣swering the
purposes of an arm in the other animal; but nevertheless is often attached
very firmly to any object it happens to approach. Rocks, stones, pieces of
timber, or sea-weeds, all seem proper to give it a fixture, and to
se∣cure it against the agitation of the waves. Nothing so common in the
rivers of the tropical climates as to see oysters growing even amidst the
branches of the forest. Many trees which grow along the banks of the stream
often bend their branches into the water, and particularly the mangrove, which
chiefly delights in a moist situation. To these the oysters hang in
clusters, like apples upon the most fertile tree; and in proportion as the
weight of the fish sinks the plant into the water, where it still
continues growing, the number of oysters encrease, and hang upon the
branches. Thus there is nothing that these shell fish will not stick
to; they are often even found to stick to each other. This is effected by
means of a glue proper to <PB N="50" REF="54"/> themselves, which, when it
cements, the join∣ing is as hard as the shell, and is as diffi∣cultly broken.
The joining substance, however, is not always of glue; but the animal grows
to the rocks, somewhat like the muscle, by threads; although these are
only seen to take root in the shell, and not, as in the muscle, to
spring from the body of the fish itself.</P>
<P>Oysters usually cast their spawn in May, which at
first appear like drops of candle-grease, and stick to any hard
substance they fall upon. These are covered with a shell in two or
three days; and in three years the animal is large enough to be brought to
market. As they invariably remain in the places where they are laid, and as
they grow without any other seeming food than the afflux of sea-water, it
is the custom at Colchester, and other parts of the kingdom, where the tide
settles in marshes on land, to pick up great quantities of small
oysters along the shore, which when first gathered seldom exceed the
size of a sixpence. These are deposited in beds where the tide comes
in, and in two or three years grow to a tolerable size. They are said to be
better tasted for being thus sheltered from the agitations of the deep; and
a mixture of fresh-water en∣tering into these repositories, is said to
improve <PB N="51" REF="55"/> their flavour, and to encrease their growth and
fatness.</P>
<P>The oysters, however, which are prepared in this manner, are
by no means so large as those found sticking to rocks at the bottom of
the sea, usually called rock-oysters. These are sometimes found as
broad as a plate, and are admired by some as excellent food. But what is the
size of these compared to the oysters of the East-Indies, some of
whose shells I have seen two feet over! The oysters found along the
coast of Coromandel are capable of furnishing a plentiful meal to eight or
ten men; but it seems universally agreed that they are no way comparable to
ours for delicacy or flavour.</P>
<P>Thus the muscle and the oyster appear to have but few
distinctions except in their shape and the power of motion in the former.
Other bivalved shell-fish, such as the cockle, the scal∣lop, and the
razor shell, have differences equally minute. The power of changing place,
which some of them effect in a manner quite peculiar to themselves, makes
their greatest difference. The scallop is particularly remarkable for its
method of moving forward upon land, or swimming upon the surface of the
water. When this animal finds itself deserted by the tide, it makes very
remarkable efforts to regain the <PB N="52" REF="56"/> water, moving towards the
sea in a most sin∣gular manner. It first gapes with its shell as
widely as it can, the edges being often an inch asunder; then it shuts them
with a jerk, and by this the whole animal rises five or six inches from the
ground. It thus tumbles any how forward, and then renews the operation until it
has attained its journey's end. When in the water it is capable of supporting
itself upon the surface; and there opening and shutting its shells, it
tumbles over and over, and makes its way with some celerity.</P>
<P>The Pivot or razor shell has a very different kind of motion.
As the former moves labo∣riously and slowly forward, so the razor shell
has only a power of sinking point downward. The shells of this animal
resemble nothing so much as the haft of a razor; and by this form it is
better enabled to dive into the soft sand at the bottom. All the motions of
this little animal are confined to sinking or rising a foot downwards or
upwards in the sand, for it never leaves the spot where first it was
planted. From time to time it is seen to rise about half way out of its
hole; but if any way disturbed, it sinks perpendicularly down again. Just
over the place where the razor buries itself, there is a small hole like a
chimney, through which the animal breathes, <PB N="53" REF="57"/> or imbibes the
sea-water. Upon the desertion of the tide, these holes are easily
distinguished by the fishermen who seek for it; and their method of
enticing the razor up from the depth of its retreat is by sprinkling a little
sea-salt upon the hole. This melting, no sooner reaches the razor below
than it rises instantly straight upwards, and shews about half its
length above the surface. This appearance however is instantaneous; and if
the fisher does not seize the opportunity, the razor buries itself with
great ease to its former depth. There it continues secure; no salt can
allure it a second time; but it remains unmolested, unless the fisher
will be at the trouble of digging it out sometimes two feet below the
surface.</P>
<P>Such are the minute differences between bi∣valved
shell-fish; but in the great out-lines of their nature they exactly
resemble each other. It is particularly in this class of shell-fish
that pearls are found in greatest abundance; and it is in the internal parts
of those shells that are of a shining silvery colour that these gems
are usually generated; but the pearl is also found to breed as well in the
muscle or the scallop as in the oyster. In fact it is found in all
bi∣valved shells, the insides of which resemble that well known
substance called mother of pearl.</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="58"/>Whether pearls be a disease or an
accident in the animal is scarce worth enquiry. The com∣mon opinion is, that
they are a kind of calculous concretion in the body of the animal, somewhat
resembling a stone in the bladder, and are con∣sequently to be
considered as a disorder. It is said, in confirmation of this opinion,
that those coasts upon which pearls are fished are very un∣healthy; and
therefore most probably oysters share the general influence of the
climate; it is also added that those oysters in which pearls are found
are always ill-tasted, which is a sign of their being unfound; and
lastly, it is asserted that the pearl grows sometimes so big as to
keep the shells of the animal from shutting, and that thus it dies by being
exposed. It is easy to see the weakness of these assertions,
which seem neither true nor amusing. To answer them in their own way, if
a stone in the bladder be a disorder, a stone in the stomach of an
ostrich is a benefit, and so it may be in the shell of an oyster. If
the shores where the pearls are fished be unwholesome to man, that,
instead of being disadvantageous, is so much the more lucky for the
oyster. If the pearl oysters are the worst tasted, so are kites and
ravens among birds; and yet we know that they are healthy and long-lived
animals: if the oyster had ever <PB N="55" REF="59"/> its shell kept
asunder by the pearl within it, that would be a disease indeed: but this
in reality never happens; for the oyster that breeds a large pearl always
breeds a large shell, and the shell itself indents to receive its
impression. The pearl upon the whole seems bred from no dis∣order in
the animal, but accidentally produced by the same matter that goes to form
the shell. This substance, which is soft at first, quickly hardens;
and thus, by successive coats, layer over layer, the pearl acquires its
dimensions. If cut through, it will be found to consist of several
coats, like an onion; and sometimes a small speck is seen in the
middle, upon which the coats were originally formed.</P>
<P>All oysters, and most shell-fish, are found to contain
pearls; but that which particularly obtains the name of the pearl oyster, has
a large strong whitish shell, wrinkled and rough with∣out, and within
smooth and of a silver colour. From these the mother-of-pearl is taken,
which is nothing more than the internal coats of the shell, resembling the
pearl in colour and con∣sistence. This is taken out and shaped into that
variety of utensils which are found so beautiful; but the pearl itself is
chiefly prized; being found but in few oysters, and generally adhering,
sometimes making a print in the body <PB N="56" REF="60"/> of the shell,
sometimes at large within the sub∣stance of the fish.</P>
<P>There are a great number of pearl fisheries in America and
Asia; but as pearls bear a worse price than formerly, those of America
are in a great measure discontinued. The most famous of all the Asiatic
fisheries is in the Persian Gulph, near the Isle of Bahren. There is
another be∣tween the coast of Madura and the Island of Ceylon; and there
was a third on the coasts of Japan: but as these noble islanders have a
con∣tempt for jewels, and an abhorrence for such Europeans as come in
pursuit of them, that fishery which is thought to be the most valuable of
all others is discontinued. The diving bu∣siness is now carried on only
in those countries where the wretchedness of one part of mankind goes to
support the magnificence of the other.</P>
<P>The chief fishery, as was said, is carried on in the
Persian Gulph, and the most valuable pearls are brought from thence. The
value of these jewels encreases not only in proportion to their size, but
also their figure and colour; for some pearls are white, others are
yellowish, others of a lead colour; and some affirm they have been found as
black as jet. What it is that gives these different tinctures to pearls is
not known; Taverner ascribes it to their lying <PB N="57" REF="61"/> two or
three weeks upon shore after the oyster is taken; Reaumur thinks it
proceeds from the colour of that part of the fish's body upon which the pearl
lies It is most probable that this colour proceeds, like the spots
frequently found on the internal surface of the shell itself, from some
accident while the pearl is growing.</P>
<P>The best coloured pearls and the roundest are brought from
the East; those of America are neither so white nor so exactly oval.
All pearls however in time become yellow; they may be considered as an animal
substance con∣verted into a stony hardness, and like ivory taking a
tincture from the air. They have been even found to decay when kept in damp or
vaulted places, and to moulder into a sub∣stance scarce harder than
chalk. When the daughters of Stilicon, that were both betrothed, one after the
other, to the emperor Honorius, were buried, much of their finery was also
de∣posited with them in the same tomb. In this manner they remained buried
for above eleven hundred years, till the foundations of the church of St. Peter
were laying. Their tomb was then discovered, and all their finery was found
in to∣lerable preservation except their pearls, which were converted by time
and damps into a chalky powder.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="62"/>The wretched people that are destined to
fish for pearls, are either Negroes of some of the poorest of the natives
of Persia. The inhabitants of this country are divided into tyrants and
slaves. The divers are not only subject to the dangers of the deep, to
tempests, to suffocation at the bottom, to being devoured by sharks, but
from their profession universally labour under a spitting of blood,
occasioned by the pressure of air upon their lungs in going down to the
bottom. The most robust and healthy young men are chosen for this
employment, but they seldom survive it above five or six years. Their
fibres become rigid; their eye∣balls turn red; and they usually die
consumptive.</P>
<P>It is amazing how very long they are seen to continue at the
bottom. Some, as we are assured, have been known to continue three quarters
of an hour under water without breathing; and to one unused to diving, ten
minutes would suffo∣cate the strongest. Whether from some effort the
blood bursts the old passage which it had in the foetus, and circulates
without going through the lungs, it is not easy to tell; but certain it is
that some bodies have been dissected with this canal of communication
open, and these extraordinary divers may be internally formed in that
manner.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="63"/>Be this as it may, no way of life seems
so laborious, so dangerous, or so painful. They fish for pearls, or
rather the oysters that contain them, in boats twenty-eight feet long; and of
these there are sometimes three or four hundred at a time, with each
seven or eight stones, which serve for anchors. There are from five to
eight divers belonging to each, that dive one after another. They are quite
naked, except that they have a net hanging down from the neck to put their
oysters in, and gloves on their hands to defend them while they pick the
oysters from the holes in the rocks; for in this manner alone can they be
gathered. Every diver is sunk by means of a stone, weighing fifty pounds,
tied to the rope by which he de∣scends. He places his foot in a kind of
stirrup, and laying hold of the rope with his left hand, with his right he
stops his nose to keep in his breath, as upon going down he takes in a very
long inspiration. They are no sooner come to the bottom, but they give the
signal to those who are in the boat to draw up the stone; which done,
they go to work, filling their net as fast as they can; and then giving
another signal, the boats above pull up the net loaded with oysters, and
shortly after the diver himself to take a new inspiration. They dive 
<PB N="60" REF="64"/> to the depth of fifteen fathoms, and seldom go deeper.
They generally go every morning by break of day to this fatiguing employment,
taking the land wind to waft them out to sea, and returning with the
sea-breeze at night. The owners of the boats usually hire the divers, and
the rest of the boats crew, as we do our la∣bourers, at so much a day. All
the oysters are brought on shore, where they are laid in a great heap till
the pearl fishery is over, which continues during the months of November and
December. When opportunity serves, they then examine every oyster, and it
is accidental whe∣ther the capture turns out advantageous. In∣deed no human
being can wish well to a com∣merce, which thus chains such a number of
fellow creatures to the bottom, to pluck up a glittering mouldering pebble.</P>

</FIGURE></P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="66"/>MULTIVALVE SHELL-FISH may be con∣sidered
as animals shut up in round boxes. To view their habitations externally, one
would be little apt to consider them as the retreats of living creatures; and
still less, to suppose that some of them carry their boxes with a
tolerable share of swiftness, so as to escape their pursuers. Of
these there are principally two kinds; such as move, and such as are
stationary: the first are usually known in our cabinets by the name of
sea-eggs; the others are as often admired, from the cavities which they
scoop out for their habitation in the hardest marble. The first are
called, by naturalists, Echini, or Urchins: the latter are called Pholades,
or File Fish. Of both there are several sorts; but, by describing
these two, we shall have a competent idea of all the rest.</P>
<P>To a slight view, the sea urchin may be com∣pared to the
husk of a chestnut; being like it round, and with a number of bony prickles
standing out on every side. To exhibit this extraordinary animal in every
light—if we could conceive a turnip stuck full of pins on every 
<PB N="62" REF="67"/> side, and running upon these pins with some degree
of swiftness, we should have some idea of this extraordinary creature.
The mouth is placed downwards; the vent is above; the shell is a hollow
vase, resembling a scooped apple; and this filled with a soft,
mus∣cular substance, through which the intestines wind from the bottom
to the top. The mouth, which is placed undermost, is large and red,
furnished with five sharp teet, which are easily discerned. The jaws
are strengthened by five small bones, in the centre of which is a small
fleshy tongue; and from this the intestines make a winding of five
spires, round the internal sides of the shell, ending at top, where the
excrements are excluded. But what makes the most ex∣traordinary part of this
animal's conformation, are its horns and its spines, that point from every
part of the body, like the horns of a snail, and that serve at once as legs
to move upon, as arms to feel with, and as instruments of capture and
defence. Between these horns it has also spines that are not endued with
such a share of motion. The spines and the horns issue from every
part of its body; the spines being hard and prickly; the horns being soft,
longer than the spines, and never seen except in the water. They are put
forward and withdrawn like the <PB REF="68"/> 
<FIGURE>
<FIGDESC>depiction of sea urchins</FIGDESC>
<HEAD>Sea Urchins.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>E. Martin sculp.</BYLINE>
</FIGURE> <PB N="63" REF="69"/> horns of a snail, and are hid at
the bases of the spines, serving, as was said before, for procuring
food and motion. All this apparatus, however, is only seen when the animal is
hunting its prey at the bottom of the water; for a few minutes after it is
taken, all the horns are withdrawn into the body, and most of the spines
drop off.</P>
<P>It is generally said of insects, that those which have the
greatest number of legs, always move the slowest: but this animal seems
to be an ex∣ception to the rule; for though furnished with two thousand
spines, and twelve hundred horns, all serving for legs, and from their
number seeming to impede each other's motion, yet it runs with some share
of swiftness at the bottom, and it is sometimes no easy matter to
overtake it. It is often taken upon the ebb, by following it in shallow
water, either in an ozier basket, or simply with the hand. Both the
spines and the horns assist its motion; and the animal is usually
seen running with the mouth down∣ward.</P>
<P>Some kinds of this animal are as good eating as the lobster;
and its eggs, which are of a deep red, are considered as a very great
deli∣cacy. But of others the taste is but indifferent; and in all places,
except the Mediterranean, they are little sought for, except as objects of
curiosity.</P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="70"/>Very different in motion, though not much
different in shape from these, are the Acorn Shell-Fish, the Thumb-footed
Shell-Fish, and the Imaginary Barnacle. These are fixed to one spot, and
appear to vegetate from a stalk. Indeed, to an inattentive spectator, each
actually seems to be a kind of fungus that grows in the deep, destitute of
animal life as well as motion. But the enquirer will soon change his opinion,
when he comes to observe this mushroom-like figure more minutely. He will
then see that the animal residing within the shell has not only life, but
some degree of voraciousness; that it has a cover, by which it opens and
shuts its shell at pleasure; that it has twelve long crooked arms,
furnished with hair, which it thrusts forth for its prey; and eight
smaller, which are generally kept in the shell. They are seen ad∣hering
to every substance that is to be met with in the ocean; rocks, root of
trees, ships bot∣toms, whales, lobsters, and even crabs; like bunches of
grapes, clung to each other. It is amusing enough to behold their
operations<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Anderson's History of
Greenland.</BIBL></NOTE>. They for some time remain motionless within their
shell; but when the sea is calm, they are seen opening the lid, and
peeping about them. They then thrust out their long neck, look 
<PB N="65" REF="71"/> round them for some time, and then abruptly retreat back
into their box, shut their lid, and lurk in darkness and security. Some
people eat them; but they are in no great repute at the tables of the
luxurious, where their deformed figure would be no objection to their being
introduced.</P>
<P>Of all animals of the shelly tribe, the Pholades are the
most wonderful. From their great powers of penetration, compared with their
apparent imbecility, they justly excite the astonishment of the curious
observer. These animals are found in different places; sometimes cloathed
in their proper shell, at the bottom of the water; some∣times concealed in
lumps of marly earth; and sometimes lodged, shell and all, in the body of
the hardest marble. In their proper shell they assume different
figures; but, in general, they somewhat resemble a muscle, except that
their shell is found actually composed of five or more pieces, the
smaller valves serving to close up the openings left by the irregular
meeting of the two principal shells. But their penetration into rocks, and
their residence there, makes up the most wonderful part of their
history.</P>
<P>This animal, when divested of its shell, re∣sembles a
roundish, soft pudding, with no in∣strument that seems in the least
fitted for boring <PB N="66" REF="72"/> into stones, or even penetrating the
softest sub∣stances. It is furnished with two teeth indeed; but
these are placed in such a situation as to be incapable of touching the
hollow surface of its stony dwelling: it has also two covers to its
shell, that open and shut at either end; but these are totally
unserviceable to it as a miner. The in∣strument with which it performs all
its ope∣rations, and buries itself in the hardest rocks, is only a broad
fleshy substance, somewhat re∣sembling a tongue, that is seen
issuing from the bottom of its shell. With this soft, yielding
instrument, it perforates the most solid mar∣bles; and having, while yet
little and young, made its way, by a very narrow entrance, into the
substance of the stone, it then begins to grow bigger, and thus to
enlarge its apartment.</P>
<P>The seeming unfitness, however, of this ani∣mal for
penetrating into rocks, and there form∣ing an habitation, has induced many
philo∣sophers to suppose that they entered the rock while it was yet in
soft state, and from the petrifying quality of the water, that the whole
rock afterwards hardened round them by de∣grees. Thus any penetrating quality,
it was thought, was unjustly ascribed to them, as they only bored into a
soft substance, that was har∣dened by time. This opinion, however, has
been <PB N="67" REF="73"/> confuted, in a very satisfactory manner, by Doctor
Bohads, who observed, that many of the pillars of the temple of Serapis at
Puteoli were penetrated by these animals. From thence he very justly
concludes, that the pholas must have pierced into them since they were
erected; for no workmen would have laboured a pillar into form; if it had been
honey-combed by worms in the quarry. In short, there can be no doubt but that
the pillars were perfectly sound when erected; and that the pholades have
attacked them, during that time in which they continued buried under water, by
means of the earthquake that swallowed up the city<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Bohadsch de Animalibus Marinis, p. 153.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P>From hence it appears that, in all nature, there is not a
greater instance of perseverance and patience than what this animal is
seen to exhibit. Furnished with the bluntest and softest augre, by
slow, successive applications, it effects what other animals are
incapable of performing by force; penetrating the hardest bodies only with
its tongue. When, while yet naked and very small, it has effected an
entrance, and has buried its body in the stone, it there continues for life
at its ease; the sea water that enters at the little aperture supplying
it with luxurious plenty. When the animal has taken too great a quan∣tity 
<PB N="68" REF="74"/> of water, it is seen to spurt it out of its hole with
some violence. Upon this seemingly thin diet, it quickly grows larger, and
soon finds itself under a necessity of enlarging its habitation and its
shell. The motion of the pholas is slow beyond conception; its progress
keeps pace with the growth of its body; and, in proportion as it becomes
larger, it makes its way farther into the rock. When it has got a certain way
in, it then turns from its former direction, and hollows downward; till, at
last, when its habitation is completed, the whole apartment resembles the
bole of a tobacco pipe; the hole in the shank being that by which the animal
entered.</P>
<P>Thus immured, the pholas lives in darkness, indolence, and
plenty; it never removes from the narrow mansion into which it has
penetrated; and seems perfectly content with being inclosed in its own
sepulchre. The influx of the sea-water, that enters by its little gallery,
satisfies all its wants; and, without any other food, it is found to grow
from seven to eight inches long, and thick in proportion.</P>
<P>But they are not supplied only with their rocky habitation;
they have also a shell to pro∣tect them: this shell grows upon them in
the body of the rock, and seems a very unnecessary addition to their
defence, which they have pro∣cured <PB N="69" REF="75"/> themselves by art.
These shells take dif∣ferent forms, and are often composed of a different
number of valves; sometimes six; sometimes but three; sometimes the
shell re∣sembles a tube with holes at either end, one for the mouth, and
the other for voiding the ex∣crements.</P>
<P>Yet the pholas thus shut up, is not so solitary an animal
as it would at first appear; for though it is immured in its hole without
egress, though it is impossible for the animal, grown to a great size,
to get out by the way it made in, yet many of this kind often meet in the heart
of the rock, and, like miners in a siege, who sometimes cross each
other's galleries, they frequently break in upon each other's retreats. Whether
their thus meeting be the work of accident or of choice, few can take upon them
to determine; certain it is, they are most commonly found in numbers in the
same rock; and sometimes above twenty are discovered within a few inches
of each other.</P>
<P>As to the rest, this animal is found in greatest numbers at
Ancona, in Italy; it is found along the shores of Normandy and Poitou, in
France; it is found also upon some of the coasts of Scot∣land: and, in
general, is considered as a very great delicacy, at the tables of the
luxurious.</P>

<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="73" REF="77"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. I. Of Frogs and Toads in General.</HEAD>
<P>IF we emerge from the deep, the first and most obvious
class of amphibious animals that occur upon land are frogs and toads.
These, wherever they reside, seem equally adapted for living upon land
and in the water, having their hearts formed in such a manner as to
dispense with the assistance of the lungs in carrying on the
circulation. The frog and the toad there∣fore can live several days under
water, without any danger of suffocation; they want but little air at the
bottom; and, what is wanting, is sup∣plied by lungs, like bladders, which are
generally distended with wind, and answer all the purposes of a
reservoir from whence to breathe.</P>
<P>To describe the form of animals so well known would be
superfluous; to mark those differences that distinguish them from each
other may be necessary. The frog moves by leaping; the toad crawls along
the ground: the frog is in general less than the toad; its colour is
brighter, and with a more polished surface: the toad is brown, rough and
dusty. The frog is light and active, and its belly com∣paratively 
<PB N="74" REF="78"/> small; the toad is slow, swolen, and incapable of
escaping. The frog, when taken, contracts itself so as to have a lump on
its back; the toad's back is straight and even. Their in∣ternal parts are
nearly the same, except that the lungs of the toad are more compact than
those of the frog; they have fewer air-bladders, and of consequence the
animal is less fitted for living under water. Such are the differences with
respect to figure and conformation; their habi∣tudes and manners exhibit a
greater variety, and require a separate description.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II. Of the Frog and its Varieties.</HEAD>
<P>THE external figure of the Frog is too well known to need a
description. Its power of taking large leaps is remarkably great, com∣pared
to the bulk of its body. It is the best swimmer of all four-footed animals;
and Nature hath finely adapted its parts for those ends, the arms being light
and active, the legs and thighs long, and furnished with very strong
muscles.</P>
<P>If we examine this animal internally, we shall find that it
has a very little brain for its size; a very wide swallow; a stomach
seemingly small, but capable of great distension. The heart in the
frog, as in all other animals that are truly amphibious, has but one ventricle;
so that the blood can circulate without the assistance of the lungs,
while it keeps under water. The lungs resemble a number of small bladders
joined together, like the cells of a honey∣comb: they are connected to the back
by muscles, and can be distended or exhausted at the animal's pleasure.
The male has two testiculi lying near the kidnies; and the female has two
ovaries, lying near the same place: but <PB N="76" REF="80"/> neither male nor
female have any of the external instruments of generation; the anus serving
for that purpose in both. Such are the most striking peculiarities in the
anatomy of a frog; and in these it agrees with the toad, the lizard, and the
serpent. They are all formed internally pretty much in the same manner,
with spongy lungs, a simple heart, and are destitute of the ex∣ternal
instruments that serve to continue the kind.</P>
<P>Of all those who have given histories of the frog, Mr.
Raesel, of Nuremberg, seems the most accurate and entertaining. His
plates of this animal are well known; his assiduity and skil∣fulness in
observing its manners are still more deserving our esteem. Instead,
therefore, of following any other, I will take him for my guide; and though it
be out of my power to amuse the reader with his beautiful designs, yet
there will be some merit in transcribing his history.</P>
<P>The Common Brown Frog begins to couple early in the season,
and as soon as the ice is thawed from the stagnating waters. In some
places the cold protracts the irgenial appetite till April; but it generally
begins about the middle of March. The male is usually of a greyish brown
colour; the female is more inclining to yellow, speckled with brown. When
they <PB N="77" REF="81"/> couple, the colours of both are nearly alike on the
back; but as they change their skins almost every eighth day, the old one
falling off in the form of a mucous, the male grows yellower, and the female
more brown. In the males the arms and legs are much stronger than in the
females; and, at the time of coupling, they have, upon their thumbs, a kind of
fleshy excrescence, which they fix firmly to the breast of the female.
This Linnaeus supposed to be the male instrument of generation; but, by
closer inspection, it is found only of service in holding the female in a
more strict embrace. It may be cut off, and the impregnation con∣tinue
unimpaired: it is sometimes found in the opposite sex; and some of the
males are found entirely without it: however, when it is cut off, the male
cannot hold the female so strongly as before.</P>
<P>The sex couple only once a year; and then continue united
sometimes for four days to∣gether. At this time they both have their bellies
greatly swolen; that of the female being filled with eggs: the male having
the skin of the whole body distended with a limpid water, which is ejected
in impregnation. As soon as the male has leaped upon the female, he throws
his fore legs round her breast, and closes them so firmly that it is
impossible with the naked <PB N="78" REF="82"/> hands to loose them. The
male clasps his fingers between each other, in the same manner as people
when they are praying; the thumbs press with their thickest sides
against the breast of the female; and though she should struggle ever
so much, nothing can induce him to let go his hold. The grasp seems
involuntary and convulsive; they cannot be easily torn asunder; and they
swim, creep, and live united for some days successively, till the
female has shed her spawn, which at length she does almost in an
instant. But how the impregnation is performed, without any apparent
instruments of generation, has long been an object of enquiry; and still
continues in great obscurity. To inve∣stigate the difficulty as carefully
as possible, our German philosopher continued to examine their mutual
congress for three years together, and availed himself of all the lights
that the knife, or analogy, could furnish.</P>
<P>After having chosen twelve couple of frogs that were thus
joined to each other, and having placed each couple in a glass vessel
with water, he scarce let them out of his sight day or night, and even
sate up two nights together to examine their operations. The first day he
observed no∣thing that deserved remark; but the second they began to be
agitated more than before; the males made a noise somewhat resembling the
<PB N="79" REF="83"/> grunting of a hog; the females only kept sinking and
rising in the water.</P>
<P>The male of the first couple ejected the hu∣midity with which
his body was swolen, by which the water in the glass was made muddy; and he
soon after quitted the female. Our philosopher continued for twelve hours
to observe whether the female would cast her spawn; but finding her
tardy, he dissected both her and the male: in the latter, the spermatic
vessels were quite empty, as might naturally have been supposed; but
for the female, her spawn still remained in her body. Upon its being
extracted, and put into water, it perished without producing any animal
whatever. From hence he justly concluded, that it required that the eggs
should be ejected from the body of the female before they could be at all
prolific. In another pair the male quitted the female, who did not eject her
spawn till sixteen days after; and these, like the former, came to
nothing. But it was very different with some of the rest. The females
ejected their spawn, while the male still remained in his station, and
impregnated the masses at different intervals as they fell from her; and
these all brought forth animals in the usual course of generation. From
these observations it was easy to infer, that the female was impreg∣nated
<PB N="80" REF="84"/> neither by the mouth, as some philo∣sophers imagined,
nor by the excrescence at the thumbs, as was the opinion of Linnaeus, but by
the inspersion of the male seminal fluid upon the eggs as they proceeded
from the body.</P>
<P>A single female produces from six to eleven hundred eggs at
a time; and, in general, she throws them all out together by a single
effort; though sometimes she is an hour in performing this task. While
she is thus bringing forth, it may be observed, that the male acts the part
of a midwife, and promotes the expulsion of the eggs by working with his
thumbs, and compressing the female's body more closely. The eggs which
were compressed in the womb, upon being emitted, expand themselves into a
round form, and drop to the bottom of the water, while the male swims off,
and strikes with his arms as usual, though they had continued so long in
a state of violent contraction.</P>
<P>The egg, or little black globe, which pro∣duces a tadpole, is
surrounded with two different kinds of liquor. That which immediately
sur∣rounds the globe is clear and transparent, and contained in its proper
membrane; that which surrounds the whole is muddy and mucous. The
transparent liquor serves for the nourishment of the tadpole from time to
time; and answers <PB N="81" REF="85"/> the same purposes that the white
of the egg does to birds. The tadpoles, when this mem∣brane is broken, are
found to adhere with their mouth to part of it; and when they get free, they
immediately sink to the bottom of the water, never being able to get to the
top after while they continue in their tadpole form.</P>
<P>But to return—When the spawn is emitted and impregnated
by the male, it drops, as was said, to the bottom, and there the white
quickly and sensibly encreases. The eggs, which during the four first
hours suffer no perceptible change, begin then to enlarge and grow lighter;
by which means they mount to the surface of the water. At the end of eight
hours, the white in which they swim grows thicker, the eggs lose their
Blackness, and as they encrease in size, some∣what of their spherical
form. The twenty-first day the egg is seen to open a little on one side,
and the beginning of a tail to peep out, which becomes more and more distinct
every day. The thirty-ninth day the little animal begins to have motion; it
moves at intervals its tail; and it is perceived that the liquor in which it is
circumfused, serves it for nourish∣ment. In two days more, some of
these little creatures fall to the bottom; while others remain swimming in
the fluid around them, <PB N="82" REF="86"/> while their vivacity and motion is
seen to en∣crease. Those which fall to the bottom re∣main there the whole
day; but having length∣ened themselves a little, for hitherto they are
doubled up, they mount at intervals to the mucous which they had quitted, and
are seen to feed upon it with great vivacity. The next day they acquire their
tadpole form. In three days more they are perceived to have two little fringes,
that serve as fins beneath the the head; and these in four days after
assume a more perfect form. It is then also that they are seen to feed
very greedily upon the pond∣weed with which they are to be supplied; and,
leaving their former food, on this they continue to subsist till they
arrive at maturity. When they come to be ninety-two days old, two small feet
are seen beginning to burgeon near the tail; and the head appears to be
separate from the body. The next day, the legs are con∣siderably enlarged;
four days after they refuse all vegetable food; their mouth appears
fur∣nished with teeth; and their hinder legs are completely formed. In two
days more the arms are completely produced; and now the frog is every way
perfect, except that it still continues to carry the tail. In this odd
situation the animal, resembling at once both a frog <PB N="83" REF="87"/>
and a lizard, is seen frequently rising to the surface, not to take food
but to breathe. In this state it continues for about six or eight hours;
and then the tail dropping off by de∣grees, the animal appears in its most
perfect form.</P>
<P>Thus the frog, in less than a day, having changed its figure,
is seen to change its appe∣tites also. So extraordinary is this
transformation, that the food it fed upon so greedily but a few days before,
is now utterly rejected; it would even starve if supplied with no other. As
soon as the animal acquires its perfect state, from having fed upon
vegetables it becomes carni∣vorous, and lives entirely upon worms and
in∣sects. But as the water cannot supply these, it is obliged to quit its
native element, and seek for food upon land, where it lives by hunt∣ing worms
and taking insects by surprize. At first, being feeble and unable to bear
the warmth of the sun, it hides among bushes and under stones; but when a
shower comes to re∣fresh the earth, then the whole multitude are seen to
quit their retreats, in order to enjoy the grateful humidity. Upon many
occasions the ground is seen perfectly blackened with their numbers; some
hunting for prey, and some seeking secure lurking places. From the
myriads <PB N="84" REF="88"/> that offer on such occasions, some have been
induced to think that these animals were gene∣rated in the clouds, and thus
showered down on the earth. But had they, like Derham, traced them to the
next pool, they would have found out a better solution for the
difficulty.</P>
<P>The frog lives for the most part out of the water; but when
the cold nights begin to set in, it returns to its native element, always
chusing stagnant waters, where it can lie without danger concealed at the
bottom. In this manner it continues torpid, or with but very little motion, all
the winter: like the rest of the dormant race, it requires no food; and the
circulation is slowly carried on without any assistance from the
air.</P>
<P>It is at the approach of spring that all these animals are
rouzed from a state of slumber to a state of enjoyment. A short time
after they rise from the bottom they begin to pair, while those that are as
yet too young come upon land before the rest. For this reason, while the
old ones continue concealed in the beginning of spring, the small ones are
more frequently seen; the former remaining in the lake to propagate, while
the latter are not yet arrived at a state of maturity.</P>
<P>The difference of sexes, which was mentioned above, is not
perceivable in these animals, until <PB N="85" REF="89"/> they have arrived at
their fourth year; nor do they begin to propagate, till they have com∣pleted
that period. By comparing their slow growth with their other habitudes, it
would ap∣pear, that they live about twelve years; but having so many enemies,
both by land and water, it is probable that few of them arrive at the end of
their term.</P>
<P>Frogs live upon insects of all kinds; but they never eat any,
unless they have motion. They continue fixed and immovable till their prey
ap∣pears; and just when it comes sufficiently near, they jump forward with
great agility, dart out their tongues, and seize it with certainty. The
tongue, in this animal, as in the toad, lizard and serpent kinds, is
extremely long, and formed in such a manner that it swallows the point down
its throat; so that a length of tongue is thus drawn out, like a sword from
its scabbard, to assail its prey. This tongue is furnished with a
glutinous substance; and whatever insect it touches, infallibly adheres,
and is thus held fast till it is drawn into the mouth.</P>
<P>As the frog is thus supplied with the power of catching its
prey, it is also very vivacious, and able to bear hunger for a very long
time. I have known one of them continue a month in summer without any other
food than the turf <PB N="86" REF="90"/> on which it was placed in a glass
vessel. We are told of a German surgeon, that kept one eight years in a
glass vessel, covered with a net. Its food was at all times but
sparing; in summer he gave it fresh grass, which it is said to have
fed upon; and, in the winter, hay, a little moistened: he likewise now and
then put flies into the glass, which it would follow with an open mouth, and
was very expert in catching them. In winter, when the flies were difficult to
be found, it usually fell away, and grew very lean; but, in the summer,
when they were plenty, it soon grew fat again. It was kept in a warm room,
and was always lively and ready to take its prey; however, in the eighth
winter, when there were no flies to be found, it fell away and died. It is not
certain how long it might have lived, had it been supplied with proper
nourishment; but we are certain, that a very little food is capable of
sufficing its necessities.</P>
<P>Nor is the frog less tenacious of life. It will live and jump
about several hours after its head has been cut off. It will continue active,
though all its bowels are taken out; and it can live some days, though
entirely stripped of its skin. This cruel trick, which is chiefly
practised among school-boys, of skinning frogs, an operation which is
done in an instant, seems for some hours <PB N="87" REF="91"/> no way to
abate their vigour. I am assured that some of them get a new skin, and
recover after this painful experiment.</P>
<P>The croaking of frogs is well known; and from thence, in some
countries, they are distin∣guished by the ludicrous title of Dutch
Night∣ingales. Indeed, the aquatic frogs of Holland are loud beyond what one
would imagine. We could hardly conceive that an animal, not bigger than one's
fist, should be able to send forth a note that is heard at three miles
distance; yet such is actually the case<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Raesel, ibid.</BIBL></NOTE>. The large water frogs have a
note as loud as the bellowing of a bull; and, for this purpose, puff up their
cheeks to a sur∣prizing magnitude. Of all frogs, however, the male only
croaks; the female is silent, and the voice in the other seems to be the
call to court∣ship. It is certain, that at these times when they couple,
the loudness of their croaking is in some places very troublesome; for
then the whole lake seems vocal; and a thousand dissonant notes
per∣fectly stun the neighbourhood. At other times also, before wet weather,
their voices are in full exertion; they are then heard with unceasing
assiduity, sending forth their call, and welcoming the approaches of
their favourite moisture. No weather-glass was ever so true as a frog in
fore∣telling <PB N="88" REF="92"/> an approaching change; and, in fact, the
German surgeon, mentioned above, kept his frog for that purpose. It was
always heard to croak at the approach of wet weather; but was as mute as a
fish, when it threatened a con∣tinuance of fair. This may probably serve to
explain an opinion which some entertain, that there is a month in the year,
called Paddock Moon, in which the frogs never croak: the whole seems to be no
more than that, in the hot season, when the moisture is dried away, and
consequently when these animals neither enjoy the quantity of health or
food that at other times they are supplied with, they shew, by their
silence, how much they are displeased with the weather. All very dry
weather is hurt∣ful to their health, and prevents them from getting their prey.
They subsist chiefly upon worms and snails; and as drought prevents
these from appearing, the frog is thus stinted in its provisions, and
also wants that grateful humidity which moistens its skin, and renders it
alert and active.</P>
<P>As frogs adhere closely to the backs of their own species,
so it has been found, by repeated experience, they will also adhere to the
backs of fishes. Few that have ponds, but know that these animals will
stick to the backs of carp, and fix their fingers in the corner of each eye.
In <PB N="89" REF="93"/> this manner they are often caught together; the carp
blinded and wasted away. Whether this proceeds from the desires of the
frog, dis∣appointed of its proper mate, or whether it be a natural enmity
between frogs and fishes, I will not take upon me to say. A story told us
by Walton, might be apt to incline us to the latter opinion.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">"As Dubravius, a bishop of Bohemia, was
walking with a friend by a large pond in that country, they saw a frog, when
the pike lay very sleepily and quiet by the shore side, leap upon his
head, and the frog having expressed malice or anger by his swolen cheeks
and staring eyes, did stretch out his legs, and embraced the pike's head,
and presently reached them to his eyes, tearing with them and his teeth
those tender parts; the pike, irritated with anguish, moves up and down the
water, and rubs himself against weeds, and whatever he thought might quit
him of his enemy; but all in vain, for the frog did continue to ride
triumphantly, and to bite and torment the pike till his strength failed, and
then the frog sunk with the pike to the bottom of the water: then presently
the frog appeared again at the top and croaked, and seemed to rejoice like a
conqueror; after <PB N="90" REF="94"/> which he presently retired to his
secret hole. The bishop that had beheld the battle, called his fisherman
to fetch his nets, and by all means to get the pike, that they might de∣clare
what had happened. The pike was drawn forth, and both his eyes eaten out; at
which, when they began to wonder, the fish∣erman wished them to forbear,
and assured them he was certain that pikes were often so
served."</Q></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III. Of the Toad and its Varieties.</HEAD>
<P>IF we regard the figure of the Toad, there seems nothing in it
that should disgust more than that of the frog. Its form and proportions
are nearly the same; and it chiefly differs in colour, which is blacker; and
its slow and heavy motion, which exhibits nothing of the agility of the frog:
yet such is the force of habit, be∣gun in early prejudice, that those who
consider the one as an harmless, playful animal, turn from the other with
horror and disgust. The frog is considered as a useful assistant,
in ridding our grounds of vermin; the toad, as a secret enemy, that only
wants an opportunity to infect us with its venom.</P>
<P>The imagination, in this manner biassed by its terrors,
paints out the toad in the most hi∣deous colouring, and cloaths it in more
than natural deformity. Its body is broad; its back flat; covered with a
dusky, pimpled hide; the belly is large and swagging; the pace laboured and
crawling; its retreat gloomy and filthy; and its whole appearance calculated to
excite disgust and horror: yet upon my first seeing a 
<PB N="92" REF="96"/> toad, none of all these deformities in the least
affected me with sensations of loathing: born, as I was, in a country where
there are no toads, I had prepared my imagination for some dread∣ful object;
but there seemed nothing to me more alarming in the sight, than in that of
a com∣mon frog; and indeed, for some time, I mistook and handled the one
for the other. When first informed of my mistake, I very well remember my
sensations: I wondered how I had escaped with safety, after handling
and dissecting a toad, which I had mistaken for a frog. I then began to
lay in a fund of horror against the whole tribe, which, though convinced they
are harm∣less, I shall never get rid of. My first imagi∣nations were too
strong not only for my reason, but for the conviction of my senses.</P>
<P>As the toad bears a general resemblance of figure to the frog,
so also it resembles that ani∣mal in its nature and appetites. Like the
frog, the toad is amphibious; like that animal, it lives upon worms and
insects, which it seizes by dart∣ing out its length of tongue; and in the
same manner also it crawls about in moist weather. The male and female
couple as in all the frog kind; their time of propagation being very early in
the spring. Sometimes the females are seen upon land, oppressed by the
males; but <PB N="93" REF="97"/> more frequently they are coupled in the water.
They continue together some hours, and adhere so fast as to tear the very
skin from the parts they stick to. In all this they entirely resemble the
frog; but the as∣sistance which the male lends the female, in bringing
forth, is a peculiarity in this species that must not be passed over in
silence. 
<Q REND="inline">"In the evening of a summer's day, a French
gentleman, being in the king's gardens at Paris, perceived two toads coupled
together, and he stopped to examine them. Two facts equally new surprized
him: the first was the extreme difficulty the female had in laying her eggs;
the second was the assistance lent her by the male for this purpose.
The eggs of the female lie in her body, like beads on a string; and after the
first, by great effort, was excluded, the male caught it with his hinder
paws, and kept working it till he had thus extracted the whole chain. In this
man∣ner the animal performed, in some measure, the functions of a midwife;
impregnating, at the same time, every egg as it issued from the
body."</Q></P>
<P>It is probable, however, that this difficulty in bringing forth,
obtains only upon land; and that the toad, which produces its spawn in the 
<PB N="94" REF="98"/> water, performs it with as much ease as a frog. They
propagate in England, exactly in the manner of frogs; and the female, instead
of retiring to dry holes, goes to the bottom of ponds, and there lies torpid
all the winter, preparing to propagate in the beginning of spring. On these
occasions, the number of males is found greatly to surpass that of the
other sex, there being above thirty to one; and twelve or fourteen are often
seen clinging to the same female.</P>
<P>When, like the frog, they have undergone all the variations of
their tadpole state, they forsake the water; and are often seen, in a
moist summer's evening, crawling up, by myriads, from fenny places, into
drier situ∣ations. There, having found out a retreat, or having dug
themselves one with their mouth and hands, they lead a patient, solitary
life, seldom venturing out, except when the moisture of a summer's
evening invites them abroad. At that time the grass is filled with snails,
and the pathways covered with worms, which make their principal food. Insects
also of every kind they are fond of; and we have the authority of Linnaeus
for it, that they sometimes continue immovable, with the mouth open, at the
bot∣tom of shrubs, where the butterflies, in some <PB N="95" REF="99"/>
measure fascinated, are seen to fly down their throats<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Amaenit, vol. vi. p. 201.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P>In a letter from Mr. Arscott, there are some curious
particulars relating to this animal, which throws great light upon its
history. 
<Q REND="inline">"Con∣cerning the toad," says he, "that lived
so many years with us, and was so great a fa∣vourite, the greatest
curiosity was its be∣coming so remarkably tame: it had fre∣quented some
steps before our hall door some years before my acquaintance commenced with
it, and had been admired by my father for its size (being the largest I
ever met with) who constantly paid it a visit every evening. I knew it
myself above thirty years; and by constantly feeding it, brought it to be
so tame, that it always came to the candle and looked up, as if expecting to
be taken up and brought upon the table, where I always fed it with in∣sects
of all sorts. It was fondest of flesh mag∣gots, which I kept in bran; it
would follow them, and when within a proper distance, would fix his eyes and
remain motionless for near a quarter of a minute, as if preparing for the
stroke, which was an instantaneous throwing its tongue at a great
distance upon <PB N="96" REF="100"/> the insect, which stuck to the tip by
a glutinous matter. The motion is quicker than the eye can follow. I cannot
say how long my father had been acquainted with the toad, before I knew it;
but when I was first acquainted with it, he used to mention it as the old
toad I have known so many years. I can answer for thirty-six years. This
old toad made its appearance as soon as the warm weather came; and I al∣ways
concluded it retired to some dry bank, to repose till spring. When we new
layed the steps, I had two holes made in the third step, on each with a
hollow of more than a yard long for it; in which I imagine it slept, as it
came from thence at its first appearance. It was seldom provoked. Neither
that toad, nor the multitudes I have seen tormented with great cruelty, ever
shewed the least de∣sire of revenge, by spitting or emitting any juice
from their pimples. Sometimes, upon taking it up, it would let out a great
quantity of clear water, which, as I have often seen it do the same upon
the steps when quite quiet, was certainly its urine, and no more than a
natural evacuation. Spiders, millepedes, and flesh maggots, seem to be this
animal's favourite food. I imagine if a bee was to be put before a toad, it
would certainly eat it <PB N="97" REF="101"/> to its cost<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Raesel tried a frog; it swallowed the bee alive: its stomach
was stung, and the animal vomited it up again.</NOTE>; but as bees are
seldom stir∣ring at the same time that toads are, they rarely come in
their way; as they do not ap∣pear after sun-rising, or before sun-set.
In the heat of the day they will come to the mouth of their hole, I believe for
air. I once, from my parlour window, observed a large toad I had in the bank
of a bowling-green, about twelve at noon, a very hot day, very busy and
active upon the grass. So un∣common an appearance made me go out to see
what it was; when I found an innu∣merable swarm of winged ants had dropped
round his hole; which temptation was as ir∣resistible as a turtle would be
to a luxurious alderman. In respect to its end, had it not been for a tame
raven, I make no doubt but it would have been now living. This bird, one day
seeing it at the mouth of its hole, pulled it out, and, although I rescued
it, pulled out one eye, and hurt it so, that not∣withstanding its living a
twelve-month, it never enjoyed itself, and had a difficulty of taking its
food, missing the mark for want of its eye. Before that accident, it had
all the appearance of perfect health."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="102"/>To this account of the toad's inoffensive
qualities, I will add another from Valisnieri, to shew that, even taken
internally, the toad is no way dangerous. 
<Q REND="inline">"In the year 1692, some German soldiers, who
had taken possession of the castle of Arceti, finding that the
peasants of the country often amused themselves in catching frogs, and
dressing them for the table; resolved to provide themselves with a like
entertainment, and made preparations for frog fishing, in the same manner.
It may easily be supposed that the Italians and their German guests
were not very fond of each other; and indeed it is natural to think that the
soldiers gave the poor people of the country many good reasons for
discontent. They were not a little pleased, therefore, when they saw them
go to a ditch where toads instead of frogs were found in abundance. The
Germans, no way distinguishing, in their sport caught them in great
numbers; while the peasants kept looking on, silently flat∣tering
themselves with the hopes of speedy revenge. After being brought home, the
toads were dressed up, after the Italian fashion; the peasants quite
happy at seeing their tyrants devour them with so good an appetite, and
expecting every moment to see <PB N="99" REF="103"/> them drop down dead: But
what was their surprize to find, that the Germans continued as well as ever,
and only complained of a slight excoriation of the lips, which probably
arose from some other cause than that of their repast."</Q></P>
<P>I will add another story, from Solenander; who tells us, that
a tradesman of Rome and his wife had long lived together with mutual
dis∣content; the man was dropsical, and the woman amorous: this ill-matched
society promised soon, by the very infirm state of the man, to have an
end; but the woman was unwilling to wait the progress of the disorder; and
therefore con∣cluded that, to get rid of her husband, nothing was left her
but poison. For this purpose, she chose out a dose that she
supposed would be the most effectual; and having calcined some toads,
mixed their powder with his drink. The man, after taking a hearty dose, found
no considerable inconvenience, except that it greatly promoted urine. His
wife, who con∣sidered this as a beginning symptom of the venom, resolved
not to stint the next dose, but gave it in greater quantites than before.
This also encreased the former symptom; and, in a few days, the woman had
the mortification to see her detested husband restored to perfect 
<PB N="100" REF="104"/> health; and remained in utter despair of ever being a

<P>From all this it will appear with what in∣justice this animal
has hitherto been treated. It has undergone every reproach; and mankind have
been taught to consider as an enemy, a creature that destroys that infect
tribe which are their real invaders. We are to treat, therefore, as fables,
those accounts that represent the toad as possessed of poison to
kill at a distance; of its ejecting its venom, which burns wherever it
touches; of its infecting those vegetables near which it resides; of its
excessive fondness for sage, which it renders poisonous by its
ap∣proach: these, and an hundred others of the same kind, probably took
rise from an anti∣pathy which some have to all animals of the kind. It is
an harmless, defenceless creature, torpid and unvenemous, and seeking the
darkest retreats, not from the malignity of its nature, but the multitude of
its enemies.</P>
<P>Like all of the frog kind, the toad is torpid in winter. It
chuses then for a retreat either the hollow root of a tree, the cleft of a
rock, or sometimes the bottom of a pond, where it is found in a state of
seeming insensibility. As it is very long lived, it is very difficult to
be killed; its skin is tough and cannot be easily <PB N="101" REF="105"/>
pierced; and, though covered with wounds, the animal continues to shew
signs of life, and every part appears in motion. But what shall we say to
its living for centuries lodged in the bosom of a rock, or cased within the
body of an oak tree, without the smallest access on any side either for
nourishment or air, and yet taken out alive and perfect! Stories of this kind
it would be as rash to contradict as difficult to believe; we have the
highest authorities bearing wit∣ness to their truth, and yet the whole
ana∣logy of nature seems to arraign them of falsehood. Bacon asserts
that toads are found in this manner; Doctor Plot asserts the same; there
is to this day a marble chimney-piece at Chatsworth with the print of the
toad upon it, and a tradition of the manner in which it was found. In the
Memoirs of the Academy of Sciences there is an account of a toad found alive
and healthy in the heart of a very thick elm, without the smallest entrance
or egress<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Vide the Year 1719.</BIBL></NOTE>. In
the year 1731 there was another found near Nants in the heart of an old oak,
without the smallest issue to its cell; and the discoverer was of
opinion, from the size of the tree, that the animal could not have been
confined there less than eighty or a hundred years, without suste∣nance 
<PB N="102" REF="106"/> and without air. To all these we can only oppose the
strangeness of the facts; the ne∣cessity this animal appears under of
receiving air; and its dying like all others in the air-pump, when deprived of
this all-sustaining fluid. But whether these be objections to weigh
against such respectable and disinterested authority, I will not
pretend to determine; certain it is that, if kept in a damp place, the toad
will live for several months without any food whatsoever.</P>
<P>To this extraordinary account, which is doubtful, I will add
another not less so; which is that of toads sucking cancerous breasts,
and thus extracting the venom and performing a cure. The first account we
have of this is in a letter to the Bishop of Carlisle from Doctor Pitfield,
who was the first person of consequence that attended the experiment. His
letter is as follows.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">"Your lordship must have taken notice of a
paragraph in the papers with regard to the application of toads to a cancered
breast. A patient of mine has sent to the neighbourhood of Hungerford, and
brought down the very woman on whom the cure was done. I have, with all the
attention I am capable of, at∣tended the operation for eighteen or twenty days,
and am surprized at the phenomenon. <PB N="103" REF="107"/> I am in no
expectation of any great service from the application; the age,
constitution, and thoroughly cancerous condition of the person, being
unconquerable barriers to it. How an ailment of that kind, absolutely local,
in an otherwise sound habit and of a likely age, might be relieved I cannot
say. But as to the operation, thus much I can assert, that there is
neither pain nor nauseousness in it. The animal is put into a linen bag
all but its head, and that is held to the part. It has generally instantly
laid hold of the foulest part of the sore, and sucked with greediness
until it dropped off dead. It has frequently happened that the creature has
swolen immediately, and from its agonies appeared to be in great pain. I have
weighed them for several days together, before and after the application, and
found their encrease of weight, in the different degrees, from a drachm to
near an ounce. They frequently sweat exceedingly, and turn quite pale;
sometimes they disgorge, recover, and be∣come lively again: I think the
whole scene is surprizing, and a very remarkable piece of natural
history. From the constant inof∣fensiveness which I have observed in
them, I almost question the truth of their poisonous 
<PB N="104" REF="108"/> spitting. Many people here expect no great good from
the application of toads to cancers; and where the disorder is not
absolutely local none is to be expected. When it is seated in any part not
to be well come at for extir∣pation, I think it is hardly to be imagined, but
that the having it sucked clean as often as you please, must give great
relief. Every body knows that dogs licking of sores cures them, which is I
suppose chiefly by keeping them clean. If there is any credit to be given
to history, poisons have been sucked out. 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>Pallentina vulnera lambit ore venena
trakens,</HI></Q> are the words of Lucan on the occa∣sion. If the people to
whom these words are applied did their cure by immediately following the
injection of the poison, the local confinement of another poison brings the
case to a great degree of similarity. I hope I have not tired your
Lordship with my long tale: as it is a true one, and in my appre∣hension a
curious piece of natural history, I could not forbear communicating it to
you. I own I thought the story in the papers to be an invention; and when I
considered the instructive principle in all animals of
self-preservation, I was confirmed in my disbelief: but what I have
related I saw; and all theory <PB N="105" REF="109"/> must yield to fact. It
is only the Rubeth, the land toad, which has the property of sucking: I
cannot find any the least mention of the property in any one of the old
natu∣ralists. My patient can bear to have but one applied in twenty-four
hours. The woman who was cured had them on day and night without
intermission for five weeks. Their time of hanging at the breast has been
from one to six hours."</Q></P>
<P>Other remarks made upon their method of performing this
extraordinary operation are as follow. 
<Q REND="inline">"Some toads die very soon after they have
sucked; others live about a quarter of an hour, and some much longer. For
ex∣ample, one that was applied about seven o'clock sucked till ten, and
died as soon as it was taken from the breast: another that immediately
succeeded continued till three o'clock, but dropped dead from the wound: each
swelled exceedingly, and of a pale colour. They do not seem to suck
greedily, and often turn their heads away; but during the time of their
sucking, they were heard to smack their lips like a young child<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>British Zoology, vol. iii. p. 338.</BIBL></NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>From this circumstantial account of the pro∣gress of this
extraordinary application, one could <PB N="106" REF="110"/> hardly suppose
that any doubt could remain of the ingenious observer's accuracy; and yet,
from informations which I have received, from authority still more
respectable, there is much reason as yet to suspend our assent. A
lady, who was under the care of the present president of the college of
physicians, was induced, by her friends, to try the experiment; and as he
saw the case was desperate, and that it would quiet her mind as well as
theirs, he permitted the trial. During the whole continuance of their
application, she could never thoroughly perceive that they sucked her; but
that did not prevent their swelling and dying, as in the former instances.
Once indeed, she said, she thought that one of them seemed to suck;
but the physician, and those who attended, could not perceive any
appearance of it. Thus, after all, it is a doubt whether these animals die by
the internal or the external application of the cancerous poison.</P>
<P>Of this animal there are several varieties; such as the
Water and the Land Toad, which probably differ only in the ground-colour of
their skin. In the first, it is more inclining to ash-colour, with brown
spots; in the other, the colour is brown, approaching to black. The water
toad is not so large as the other; <PB REF="111"/>

<P>E. Martin sc.</P>
</FIGURE> <PB N="107" REF="112"/> but both equally breed in that
element. The size of the toad with us is generally from two to four inches
long; but, in the fenny countries of Europe, I have seen them much larger;
and not less than a common crab, when brought to table. But this is nothing
to what they are found in some of the tropical climates, where travellers
often, for the first time, mistake a toad for a tortoise. Their usual
size is from six to seven inches; but there are some still larger,
and as broad as a plate. Of these some are beautifully streaked and
coloured; some studded over, as if with pearls; others bristled with
horns or spines; some have the head distinct from the body, while others
have it so sunk in, that the animal appears without a head. All these are
found in the tropical climates, in great abundance; and particularly after a
shower of rain. It is then that the streets seem entirely paved with
them; they then crawl from their retreats, and go into all places, to enjoy
their favourite moisture. With us the opinion of its raining toads and frogs,
has long been justly ex∣ploded, but it still is entertained in the tropical
countries; and that not only by the savage na∣tives, but the more refined
settlers, who are apt enough to add the prejudices of other nations to their
own.</P>
<P><PB N="108" REF="113"/>It would be a tedious, as well as a
useless task, to enter into all the minute discriminations of these
animals, as found in different countries or places; but the Pipal, or the
Surinam Toad, is too strange a creature, not to require an ex∣act
description. There is not perhaps, in all nature, a more extraordinary
phenomenon, than that of an animal breeding and hatching its young in its back;
from whence, as from a kind of hot bed, they crawl, one after the other, when
come to maturity.</P>
<P>The pipal is in form more hideous than even the common toad,
Nature seeming to have marked all those strange mannered ani∣mals with
peculiar deformity. The body is flat and broad; the head small; the jaws,
like those of a mole, are extended, and evidently formed for rooting in the
ground: the skin of the neck forms a sort of wrinkled collar: the colour of
the head is of a dark chesnut, and the eyes are small: the back, which is
very broad, is of a lightish grey, and seems covered over with a number of
small eyes, which are round, and placed at nearly equal distances. These
eyes are very different from what they seem; they are the animal's eggs,
covered with their shells, and placed there for hatching. These eggs are
buried deep in the skin, and in <PB N="109" REF="114"/> the beginning of
incubation but just appear; and are very visible when the young animal is
about to burst from its confinement. They are of a reddish, shining
yellow colour; and the spaces between them are full of small warts,
resembling pearls.</P>
<P>This is their situation, previous to their coming forth; but
nothing so much demands our admiration, as the manner of their pro∣duction.
The eggs, when formed in the ovary, are sent, by some internal canals,
which ana∣tomists have not hitherto described, to lie and come to maturity
under the bony substance of the back: in this state they are impregnated
by the male, whose seed finds its way by pores very singularly contrived,
and pierces not only the skin but the periosteum: the skin, however, is
still apparently entire, and forms a very thick covering over the whole
brood; but as they advance to maturity, at different intervals, one after
another, the egg seems to start forward and burgeon from the back, becomes
more yellow, and at last breaks; when the young one puts forth its head: it
still, however, keeps its situation, until it has acquired a proper degree
of strength, and then it leaves the shell, but still continues to keep
upon the back of the parent. In this manner the pipal is seen travelling with
<PB N="110" REF="115"/> her wonderous family on her back, in all the different
stages of maturity. Some of the strange progeny, not yet come to
sufficient per∣fection, appear quite torpid, and as yet without life in the
egg: others seem just beginning to rise through the skin; here peeping
forth from the shell; and there, having entirely forsaken their prison:
some are sporting at large upon the parent's back; and others descending
to the ground, to try their own fortune below.</P>
<P>Such is the description given us of this strange production,
by Seba; in which he dif∣fers from Ruysch, who affirms, that the young ones
are bred in the back of the male only, where the female lays her eggs. I have
fol∣lowed Seba, however; not because he is better authority, but because he
is more positive of the truth of his account, and asserts, assuredly,
that the eggs are found on the back of the female only. Many circumstances,
however, are wanting towards completing his inform∣ation; such as a
description of the passage by which the egg finds its way into the back;
the manner of its fecundation; the time of gesta∣tion; as also an history
of the manners of this strange animal itself: but, by a prolixity that too
much prevails among naturalists at present, he leaves the most
interesting object of curiosity, <PB N="111" REF="116"/> to give us a
detailed description of the legs and claws of the pipal, about which we have
very little concern.</P>
<P>The male pipal is every way larger than the female, and has the
skin less tightly drawn round the body. The whole body is covered with
pustules, resembling pearls; and the belly, which is of a bright yellow,
seems as if it were sewed up from the throat to the vent, a seam being
seen to run in that direction. This ani∣mal, like the rest of the frog
kind, is most pro∣bably harmless; though we are told of terrible effects
resulting from its powder when calcined. This, however, must certainly be
false: no creature whatever, when calcined, can be poi∣sonous; for the fire
burns away whatever might have been dangerous in their composition: all
animal substances, when calcined, being entirely the same.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. Of Lizards in General.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is scarce a naturalist that has treated of Lizards,
but has a particular manner of ranking them, in the scale of animated nature.
Ray, rather struck with the number of their legs, than their habits and
conformation, has ex∣alted them among quadrupedes; while Linnaeus, attentive
only to their long slender forms, has degraded them among serpents.
Brisson gives them a distinct class by themselves, under the name of
Reptiles. Klein gives them a class inferior to beasts, under the name of
Naked Quadrupedes. Some, in short, from their scaly covering, and
fondness for the water, have given them to the fishes; while there have not
been wanting naturalists who have classed them with insects, as the
smaller kinds of this class seem to demand.</P>
<P>It is indeed no easy matter to tell to what class in nature
lizards are chiefly allied. They are unjustly raised to the rank of
beasts, as they bring forth eggs, dispense with breathing, and are not
covered with hair. They cannot be placed among fishes, as the majority of
them <PB N="113" REF="118"/> live upon land: they are excluded from the
serpent tribe, by their feet, upon which they run with some celerity; and
from the insects, by their size; for though the Newt may be looked upon in
this contemptible light, a Cro∣codile would be a terrible insect indeed. Thus
lizards are, in some measure, excluded from every rank; while they exhibit
somewhat of the properties of all; the legs and celerity of the quadrupede; a
facility of creeping through narrow and intricate ways, like the serpent; and
a power of living in the water, like fishes: however, though endued with
these various powers, they have no real advantages over any other class of
animated nature; for what they gain in aptitude for one element, they lose in
their fitness for another. Thus, between both, they are an aukward, ungainly
tribe; neither so alert upon land, nor so nimble in the water, as the
respective inhabitants of either abode: and, indeed, this holds through all
nature, that, in proportion as the seeming advantages of inferior animals are
multiplied, their real ones are abridged; and all their instincts are
weakened and lost, by the variety of channels into which they are
divided.</P>
<P>As lizards thus differ from every other class of animals, they
also differ widely from each <PB N="114" REF="119"/> other. With respect to
size, no class of beings has its ranks so opposite. What, for
instance, can be more removed than the small Cameleon, an inch long, and
the Alligator of the river Amazons, above twenty-seven feet? To an
in∣attentive observer, they would appear entirely of different kinds; and
Seba wonders how they ever came to be classed together.</P>
<P>The colour of these animals also is very va∣rious, as they
are found of a hundred different hues, green, blue, red, chesnut, yellow,
spot∣ted, streaked, and marbled. Were colour alone capable of
constituting beauty, the lizard would often please; but there is
something so repressing in the animal's figure, that the brilliancy of
its scales, or the variety of its spots, only tend to give an air of more
exquisite venom of greater malignity. The figure of these animals is not
less various: sometimes swolen in the belly; sometimes pursed up at
the throat; sometimes with a rough set of spines on the back, like the
teeth of a saw; sometimes with teeth, at others with none; sometimes
venomous, at others harmless, and even philanthropic: sometimes smooth
and even; sometimes with a long, slen∣der tail; and often with a shorter
blunt one.</P>
<P>But their greatest distinction arises from their manner of
bringing forth their young. Firstly, <PB N="115" REF="120"/> some of them
are viviparous. Secondly, some are oviparous; and which may be considered
in three distinct ways. Thirdly, some bring forth small spawn, like
fishes. The Crocodile, the Iguana, and all the larger kinds, bring forth
eggs, which are hatched by the heat of the sun: the animals that issue
from them are complete upon leaving the shell; and their first efforts are
to run to seek food in their pro∣per element. The viviparous kinds, in which
are all the salamanders, come forth alive from the body of the female,
perfect and active, and suffer no succeeding change. But those which are
bred in the water, and, as we have reason to think, from spawn, suffer a
very considerable change in their form. They are produced with an external
skin or covering, that sometimes encloses their feet, and gives them a
serpentine appearance. To this false skin, fins are added, above and
below the tail, that serve the animal for swimming; but when the false
skin drops off, these drop off also; and then the lizard, with its four
feet, is completely formed, and forsakes the water.</P>
<P>From hence it appears, that of this tribe there are three
distinct kinds, differently pro∣duced, and most probably very different in
their formation. But the history of these animals is <PB N="116" REF="121"/>
very obscure; and we are as yet incapable of laying the line that separates
them. All we know, as was said before, is, that the great animals of this
kind are <HI>mostly</HI> produced perfect from the egg; the salamanders are
<HI>generally</HI> vi∣viparous; and <HI>some</HI> of the water lizards
imper∣fectly produced. In all these most unfinished productions of
Nature, if I may so call them, the varieties in their structure encreases
in pro∣portion to their imperfections. A poet would say, that Nature grew
tired of the nauseous formation; and left accident to finish the rest of
her handy work.</P>
<P>However, the three kinds have many points of similitude; and,
in all their varieties of figure, colour, and production, this tribe is
easily distinguished, and strongly marked. They have all four short
legs; the two fore feet somewhat resembling a man's hand and arm. They have
tails almost as thick as the body at the beginning, and that generally run
tapering to a point. They are all amphibious also; equally capable of living
upon land and water; and formed internally in the same manner with the
tortoise, and other animals, that can continue a long time without
respira∣tion: in other words, their lungs are not so necessary to
continue life and circulation, <PB N="117" REF="122"/> but that their play may
be stopped for some considerable time, while the blood performs its
circuit round the body by a shorter commu∣nication.</P>
<P>These are differences that sufficiently separate lizards
from all other animals; but it will be very difficult to fix the limits that
distinguish the three kinds from each other. The <HI>crocodile</HI> tribe,
and its affinities, are sufficiently distin∣guished from all the rest,
by their size and fierce∣ness; the <HI>salamander</HI> tribe is
distinguished by their deformity, their frog-like heads, the shortness
of their snouts, their swolen belly, and their viviparous production. With
regard to the rest, which we may denominate the cameleon or lizard kind,
some of which bring forth from the egg, and some of which are im∣perfectly
formed from spawn, we must groupe them under one head, and leave time to
unravel the rest of their history.</P>

<PB N="118" REF="123"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. V. Of the Crocodile and its Affinities.</HEAD>
<P>THE Crocodile is an animal placed at a happy distance from the
inhabitants of Europe, and formidable only in those regions where men are
scarce, and arts are but little known. In all the cultivated and populous
parts of the world, the great animals are entirely banished, or rarely
seen. The appearance of such raises at once a whole country up in arms to
oppose their force; and their lives generally pay the forfeit of their
temerity. The crocodile, therefore, that was once so terrible along the banks
of the river Nile, is now neither so large, nor its numbers so great as
formerly. The arts of mankind have, through a course of ages, powerfully
operated to its destruction; and, though it is sometimes seen, it appears
comparatively ti∣morous and feeble.</P>
<P>To look for this animal in all its natural terrors, grown to an
enormous size, propa∣gated in surprizing numbers, and committing
unceasing devastations, we must go to the uninhabited regions of Africa
and America, to those immense rivers that roll through ex∣tensive

</FIGURE> <PB N="119" REF="125"/> and desolate kingdoms, where
arts have never penetrated, where force only makes distinction, and the
most powerful animals exert their strength with confidence and security.
Those that sail up the river Amazons, or the river Niger, well know how
numerous and terrible those animals are in such parts of the world. In both
these rivers, they are found from eighteen to twenty-seven feet long; and
sometimes lying as close to each other, as a raft of timber upon one of our
streams. There they indolently bask on the surface, no way disturbed at
the approach of an enemy, since, from the repeated trials of their
strength, they found none that they were not able to subdue.</P>
<P>Of this terrible animal there are two kinds; the Crocodile,
properly so called, and the Cay∣man or Alligator. Travellers, however, have
rather made the distinction than Nature; for in the general outline, and in
the nature of these two animals they are entirely the same. It would be
speaking more properly to call these animals the Crocodiles of the
eastern and the western world; for in books of voyages, they are so
entirely confounded together, that there is no knowing whether the Asiatic
animal be the cro∣codile of Asia, or the alligator of the western world.
The distinctions usually made between <PB N="120" REF="126"/> the crocodile
and alligator are these: the body of the crocodile is more slender than
that of the alligator; its snout runs off tapering from the forehead, like
that of a greyhound; while that of the other is indented, like the nose of a
lap-dog. The crocodile has a much wider swallow, and is of an ash-colour;
the alligator is black, varied with white, and is thought not to be so
mischievous. All these distinctions, however, are very slight, and can
be reckoned little more than minute variations.</P>
<P>This animal grows to a great length, being sometimes found
thirty feet long, from the tip of the snout to the end of the tail: its
most usual length, however, is eighteen. One which was dissected by the
Jesuits at Siam was of the latter dimensions; and as the description
which is given of it, both externally and inter∣nally, is the most accurate
known of this noted animal, I must beg leave to give it as I find it, though
somewhat tedious. It was eighteen feet and an half, French measure, in
length; of which the tail was no less than five feet and an half, and the
head and neck above two feet and an half. It was four feet nine inches in
circumference, where thickest. The fore legs had the same parts and
conformation as the arms of a man, both within and without. The 
<PB N="121" REF="127"/> hands, if they may be so called, had five fingers; the
two last of which had no nails, and were of a conical figure. The hinder
legs, including the thigh and paw, were two feet two inches long; the paws,
from the joint to the extremity of the longest claws, were above nine inches:
they were divided into four toes, of which three were armed with large claws,
the longest of which was an inch and an half: these toes were united by a
membrane, like those of a duck, but much thicker. The head was long, and had
a little rising at the top; but the rest was flat, and especially towards
the extremity of the jaws. It was covered by a skin, which adhered firmly to
the skull and to the jaws. The skull was rough and unequal in several
places; and about the middle of the forehead there were two bony crests,
about two inches high: the skull between these two crests was proof
against a musquet-ball; for it only rendered the part a little white that
it struck against. The eye was very small, in proportion to the rest of
the body, and was so placed within its orbit, that the outward part, when the
lid was closed, was only an inch long, and the line running parallel to the
opening of the jaws. It was covered with a double lid, one within and one
without: that within, like the nictitating membrane in birds, was folded in the
great corner of the eye, and had <PB N="122" REF="128"/> a motion towards the
tail, but being trans∣parent, it covered the eye without hindering the
sight. The iris was very large in proportion to the globe of the eye, and was
of a yellowish grey colour. Above the eye the ear was placed, which opened
from above downwards, as if it were by a kind of spring, by means of a
solid, thick, cartilaginous substance. The nose was placed in the
middle of the upper jaw, near an inch from its extremity, and was perfectly
round and flat, being near two inches in diameter, of a black, soft, spongy
substance, not unlike the nose of a dog. The jaws seemed to shut one
within another; and nothing can be more false than that the animal's under
jaw is without mo∣tion; it moves, like the lower jaw in all other animals,
while the upper is fixed to the skull and absolutely immoveable. The animal
had twenty-seven cutting teeth in the upper jaw, and fifteen in the lower,
with several void spaces between them: they were thick at the bottom, and
sharp at the point, being all of different sizes, except ten large hooked
ones, six of which were in the lower jaw, and four in the upper. The mouth
was fifteen inches in length, and eight and an half in breadth, where
broadest. The distance of the two jaws, when opened as wide as they could
be, was fifteen inches and an half: this is a very wide yawn, and could
easily enough take in the <PB N="123" REF="129"/> body of a man. The colour of
the body was of a dark brown on the upper part, and of a whitish citron
below, with large spots of both colours on the sides. From the shoulders
to the extremity of the tail, the animal was covered with large scales, of a
square form, disposed like parallel girdles, and fifty-two in num∣ber;
but those near the tail were not so thick as the rest. The creature was
covered not only with these, but all over with a coat of armour; which,
however, was not proof against a mus∣quet-ball, contrary to what has been
commonly asserted: however, it must be confessed, that the attitude
in which the animal was placed, might contribute to render the skin more
penetrable; for probably if the ball had struck obliquely against the
shell, it would have flown off. Those parts of the girdles underneath the
belly were of a whitish colour, and were made up of scales of divers
shapes, but not so hard as those on the back.</P>
<P>With respect to the internal parts of the ani∣mal, the gullet
was large in proportion to the mouth; and a ball of wood, as large as one's
head, readily ran down, and was drawn up again. The guts were but short, in
comparison, being not so long as the animal's body. The tongue, which
some have erroneously asserted <PB N="124" REF="130"/> this animal was
without, consisted of a thick spongy soft flesh, and was strongly
connected to the lower jaw. The heart was of the size of a calf's, of a
bright red colour, the blood passing as well from the veins to the aorta as
into the lungs. There was no bladder; but the kidneys sent the urine to be
discharged by the anus. There were sixty-two joints in the back-bone,
which, though very closely united, had sufficient play to enable the animal
to bend like a bow to the right and the left; so that what we hear of
escaping the creature by turning out of the right line, and of the animal's
not being able to wheel readily after its prey, seems to be fa∣bulous. It is
most likely the crocodile can turn with great ease, for the joints of its
back are not stiffer than those of other animals which we know by
experience can wheel about very nimbly for their size.</P>
<P>Such is the figure and conformation of this formidable animal,
that unpeoples countries, and makes the most navigable rivers desart and
dangerous. They are seen, in some places, ly∣ing for whole hours, and even
days, stretched in the sun, and motionless; so that one not used to
them, might mistake them for trunks of trees, covered with a rough and dry
bark; but the mistake would soon be fatal, if not pre∣vented: 
<PB N="125" REF="131"/> for the torpid animal, at the near approach of any
living thing, darts upon it with instant swiftness, and at once drags it
down to the bottom. In the times of an inun∣dation, they sometimes enter the
cottages of the natives, where the dreadful visitant seizes the first
animal it meets with. There have been several examples of their taking a man
out of a canoe in the sight of his companions, with∣out their being able to
lend him any assistance.</P>
<P>The strength of every part of the crocodile is very great; and
its arms, both offensive and defensive, irresistible. We have seen,
from the shortness of its legs, the amazing strength of the tortoise:
but what is the strength of such an animal, compared to that of the
crocodile, whose legs are very short and whose size is so superior.
The back-bone is jointed in the firmest manner; the muscles of the fore and
hinder legs are vigorous and strong; and its whole form calculated for force.
Its teeth are sharp, numerous and formidable; its claws are long and
tenaceous; but its principal instrument of destruction is the tail: with a
single blow of this it has often overturned a canoe, and seized upon the
poor savage its conductor.</P>
<P>Though not so powerful, yet it is very ter∣rible even upon
land. The crocodile seldom, <PB N="126" REF="132"/> except when pressed by
hunger, or with a view of depositing its eggs, leaves the water. Its usual
method is to float along upon the surface and seize whatever animals come
within its reach; but when this method fails, it then goes closer to the
bank. Disappointed of its fishy prey, it there waits covered up among the
sedges, in patient expectation of some land animal that comes to drink; the
dog, the bull, the tiger, or man himself. Nothing is to be seen of the
insiduous destroyer as the animal approaches; nor is its retreat
discovered till it be too late for safety. It seizes the victim with a
spring, and goes at a bound much faster than so unwieldy an animal could
be thought capable of exerting; then having secured the creature with both
teeth and claws, it drags it into the water, instantly sinks with it to the
bottom, and in this manner quickly drowns it.</P>
<P>Sometimes it happens that the creature the crocodile has thus
surprized escapes from its grasp wounded, and makes off from the
river∣side. In such a case, the tyrant pursues with all its force, and
often seizes it a second time; for though seemingly heavy, the crocodile
runs with great celerity. In this manner it is some∣times seen above half a
mile from the bank, in <PB N="127" REF="133"/> pursuit of an animal wounded
beyond the power of escaping, and then dragging it back to the river-side,
where it feasts in security.</P>
<P>It often happens, in its depredations along the bank, that the
crododile seizes on a crea∣ture as formidable as itself, and meets with a
most desperate resistance. We are told of fre∣quent combats between the
crocodile and the tiger. All creatures of the tiger kind are con∣tinually
oppressed by a parching thirst that keeps them in the vicinity of great
rivers, whither they descend to drink very frequently. It is upon these
occasions that they are seized by the crocodile; and they die not
unrevenged. The instant they are seized upon, they turn with the greatest
agility, and force their claws into the crocodile's eyes, while he plunges with
his fierce antagonist into the river. There they continue to struggle for
some time, till at last the tiger is drowned.</P>
<P>In this manner the crocodile seizes and destroys all
animals, and is equally dreaded by all. There is no animal but man alone that
can com∣bat it with success. We are assured by Labat, that a Negro,
with no other weapons than a knife in his right hand, and his left arm wrapped
round with a cow hide, ventures boldly to at∣tack this animal in its own
element. As soon <PB N="128" REF="134"/> as he approaches the crocodile, he
presents his left arm, which the animal swallows most gree∣dily; but
sticking in its throat, the Negro has time to give it several stabs under
the throat; and the water also getting in it at the mouth, which is held
involuntarily open, the creature is soon bloated up as big as a tun, and
expires.</P>
<P>To us who live at a distance from the rapacity of these
animals, these stories appear strange, and yet most probably are true.
From not having seen any thing so formidable or bold in the circle of our
own experience, we are not to determine upon the wonderful transactions in
distant climates. It is probable that these, and a number of more dreadful
encounters, happen every day among those forests and in those rivers
where the most formidable animals are known to reside; where the elephant
and the rhinoceros, the tiger and the hipopotamos, the shark and the
crocodile, have frequent op∣portunities of meeting, and every day of re∣newing
their engagements.</P>
<P>Whatever be the truth of these accounts, certain it is that
crocodiles are taken by the Siamese in great abundance. The natives of that
empire seem particularly fond of the capture of all the great animals with
which their country abounds. We have already seen their success 
<PB N="129" REF="135"/> in taking and taming the elephant; nor are they less
powerful in exerting their dominion over the crocodile. The manner of taking it
in Siam is by throwing three or four strong nets across a river, at proper
distances from each other; so that if the animal breaks through the
first, it may be caught by one of the rest. When it is first taken, it
employs the tail, which is the grand instrument of strength, with great
force; but after many unsuccessful struggles, the animal's strength is
at last exhausted. Then the natives approach their prisoner in boats, and
pierce him with their weapons in the
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> tender parts till he is
weakened with the loss of blood. When he has done stirring, they begin by
tying up his mouth, and with the same cord they fasten his head to his
tail, which last they bend back like a bow. However, they are not yet
perfectly secure from his fury; but, for their greater safety, they tie his
fore feet as well as those behind to the top of his back. These precautions
are not useless; for if they were to omit them, the crocodile would soon
recover strength enough to do a great deal of mis∣chief.</P>
<P>The crocodile thus brought into subjection, or bred up young,
is used to divert and enter∣tain the great men of the east. It is often 
<PB N="130" REF="136"/> managed like an horse; a curb is put into its mouth,
and the rider directs it as he thinks pro∣per. Though aukwardly formed, it does
not fail to proceed with some degree of swiftness; and is thought to move
as fast as some of the most unwieldy of our own animals, the hog or the
cow. Some, indeed, assert that no animal could escape it, but for its
difficulty in turning; but to this resource we could wish none would
trust who are so unhappy as to find themselves in danger.</P>
<P>Along the rivers of Africa this animal is some∣times taken in
the same manner as the shark. Several Europeans go together in a large
boat, and throw out a piece of beef upon a hook and strong fortified line,
which the cro∣codile seizing and swallowing, is drawn along, floundering
and struggling until its strength is quite exhausted, when it is pierced
in the belly, which is its tenderest part; and thus after num∣berless
wounds is drawn ashore. In this part of the world also, as well as at Siam,
the cro∣codile makes an object of savage pomp near the palaces of their
monarchs. Philips informs us that at Sabi, on the slave coast, there are
two pools of water near the royal palace, where cro∣codiles are bred as we
breed carp in our ponds in Europe.</P>
<P><PB N="131" REF="137"/>Hitherto I have been describing the
crocodile as it is found in unpeopled countries, and un∣disturbed by frequent
encounters with mankind. In this state it is fierce and cruel, attacking
every object that seems endued with motion: but in Egypt, and other countries
long peopled, where the inhabitants are civilized and the rivers fre∣quented,
this animal is solitary and fearful. So far from coming to attack a man, it
sinks at his ap∣proach with the utmost precipitation; and, as if
sensible of superior power, ever declines the en∣gagement. We have seen
more than one in∣stance in animated nature of the contempt which at first
the lower orders of the creation have for man, till they have experienced his
powers of de∣struction. The lion and the tiger among beasts, the whale
among fishes, the albatross and the penguin among birds, meet the first
encounters of man without dread or apprehension; but they soon learn to
acknowledge his superiority; and take refuge from his power in the deepest
fastnesses of nature. This may account for the different characters which
have been given us of the crocodile and the alligator by travellers at
different times: some describing them as harmless and fearful, as ever
avoiding the sight of a man, and preying only upon fishes; others ranking
them among the destroyers of <PB N="132" REF="138"/> nature; describing them
as furnished with strength and impelled by malignity to do mis∣chief;
representing them as the greatest ene∣mies of mankind, and particularly
desirous of human prey. The truth is, the animal has been justly
described by both; being such as it is found in places differently peopled
or dif∣ferently civilized. Wherever the crocodile has reigned long
unmolested, it is there fierce, bold, and dangerous; wherever it has been
harrassed by mankind, its retreats invaded, and its numbers destroyed, it
is there timorous and inoffensive.</P>
<P>In some places, therefore, this animal, instead of being
formidable, is not only inoffensive, but is cherished and admired. In the
river San Do∣mingo, the crocodiles are the most inoffensive animals in
nature; the children play with them, and ride about on their backs; they even
beat them sometimes without receiving the smallest injury. It is true the
inhabitants are very careful of this gentle breed, and consider them as
harmless domestics.</P>
<P>It is probable that the smell of musk, which all these
animals exhale, may render them agreeable to the savages of that part of
Africa. They are often known to take the part of this animal which contains the
musk and wear it as a per∣fume <PB N="133" REF="139"/> about their persons.
Travellers are not agreed in what part of the body these musk∣bags are
contained; some say in the ears; some, in the parts of generation; but
the most pro∣bable opinion is, that this musky substance is amassed
in glands under the legs and arms. From whatsoever part of the body this
odour proceeds, it is very strong and powerful, tinc∣turing the flesh of
the whole body with its taste and smell. The crocodile's flesh is at
best very bad tough eating; but unless the musk-bags be separated it is
insupportable. The Negroes themselves cannot well digest the flesh; but
then, a crocodile's egg is to them the most delicate morsel in the world.
Even sa∣vages exhibit their epicures as well as we; and one of true taste
will spare neither pains nor danger to furnish himself with his favourite
re∣past. For this reason, he often watches the places where the female
comes to lay her eggs, and upon her retiring seizes the booty.</P>
<P>All crocodiles breed near fresh waters; and though they are
sometimes found in the sea, yet that may be considered rather as a place
of excursion than abode. They produce their young by eggs, as was said
above; and for this purpose the female when she comes to lay, chooses a
place by the side of a river, or some <PB N="134" REF="140"/> fresh water
lake, to deposit her brood in. She always pitches upon an extensive sandy
shore, where she may dig a hole without danger of de∣tection from the
ground being fresh turned up. The shore must also be gentle and
shelving to the water, for the greater convenience of the animal's going and
returning; and a convenient place must be found near the edge of the
stream, that the young may have a shorter way to go. When all these
requisites are adjusted, the animal is seen cautiously stealing up on
shore to deposit her burthen. The presence of a man, a beast, or even a
bird, is sufficient to deter her at that time; and if she perceives any
creature looking on, she infallibly returns. If, however, nothing appears,
she then goes to work, scratching up the sand with her fore paws, and
making a hole pretty deep in the shore. There she de∣posits from eighty
to an hundred eggs, of the size of a tennis-ball, and of the same figure,
covered with a tough white skin like parchment. She takes above an hour to
perform this task; and then covering up the place so artfully that it can
scarcely be perceived, she goes back to return again the next day. Upon her
return, with the same precaution as before, she lays about the same
number of eggs; and the day following also a like number. Thus having 
<PB N="135" REF="141"/> deposited her whole quantity, and having co∣vered them
close up in the sand, they are soon vivified by the heat of the sun;
and at the end of thirty days, the young ones begin to break open the shell.
At this time the female is in∣stinctively taught that her young ones want
relief; and she goes up on land to scratch away the sand and set them
free. Her brood quickly avail themselves of their liberty; a part run
unguided to the water; another part ascend the back of the female, and are
carried thither in greater safety. But the moment they arrive at the water,
all natural connexion is at an end: when the female has introduced her young to
their natural element, not only she, but the male, become among the number of
their most formidable enemies, and devour as many of them as they can. The
whole brood scatters into different parts at the bottom; by far the
greatest number are destroyed; and the rest find safety in their
agility or minuteness.</P>
<P>But it is not the crocodile alone that is thus found to thin
their numbers; the eggs of this animal are not only a delicious feast to the
savage, but are eagerly sought after by every beast and bird of prey. The
ichneumon was erected into a deity among the ancients for its success in
destroying the eggs of these monsters: <PB N="136" REF="142"/> at
present that species of the vulture called the Gallinazo is their most
prevailing enemy. All along the banks of great rivers, for thousands of
miles, the crocodile is seen to propagate in numbers that would soon
over-run the earth, but for the vulture, that seems appointed by Providence
to abridge its fecundity. These birds are ever found in greatest numbers
where the crocodile is most numerous; and hiding themselves within the
thick branches of the trees that shade the banks of the river, they watch the
female in silence, and permit her to lay all her eggs without interruption.
Then when she has retired, they encourage each other with cries to the
spoil; and flocking all together upon the hidden treasure, tear up the
eggs, and devour them in a much quicker time than they were deposited. Nor
are they less diligent in at∣tending the female while she is carrying her
young to the water; for if any one of them happens to drop by the way, it is
sure to receive no mercy.</P>
<P>Such is the extraordinary account given us by late travellers of
the propagation of this animal; an account adopted by Linnaeus and the most
learned naturalists of the age<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Ulloa.</BIBL></NOTE>. Yet, if one might argue from the
general analogy <PB N="137" REF="143"/> of nature, the crocodile's devouring her
own young when she gets to the water seems doubtful. This may be a story
raised from the general idea of this animal's rapacious cruelty; when, in
fact, the crocodile only seems more cruel than other animals because it has
more power to do mischief. It is probable that it is not more divested of
parental tenderness than other creatures; and I am the more led to think so
from the peculiar formation of one of the crocodile kind. This is called the
Open Bellied Crocodile, and is furnished with a false belly like the
opossum, where the young creep out and in as their dangers or
necessities require. The crocodile thus furnished at least cannot be
said to be an enemy to her own young, since she thus gives them more than
parental protection. It is probable also that this Open Bellied Cro∣codile is
viviparous, and fosters her young that are prematurely excluded in this
second womb, until they come to proper maturity.</P>
<P>How long the crocodile lives we are not certainly informed; if
we may believe Aristotle, it lives the age of a man; but the ancients so
much amused themselves in inventing fables concerning this animal, that
even truth from them is suspicious. What we know for certain from the
ancients is, that among the various <PB N="138" REF="144"/> animals that were
produced to fight in the am∣phitheatre at Rome, the combat of the cro∣codile
was not wanting<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Plin. lib. viii. c.
26.</BIBL></NOTE>. Marcus Scaurus produced them living in his unrivalled
exhi∣bitions; and the Romans considered him as the best citizen, because
he furnished them with the most expensive entertainments. But
entertain∣ment at that corrupt time was their only occu∣pation.</P>

<PB N="139" REF="145"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. VI. Of the Salamander.</HEAD>
<P>THE ancients have described a lizard that is bred from heat,
that lives in the flames, and feeds upon fire as its proper nourishment. As
they saw every other element, the air, the earth and water, inhabited, fancy
was set to work to find or make an inhabitant in fire; and thus to people
every part of nature. It will be need∣less to say that there is no such
animal existing; and that, of all others, the modern Salamander has the
smallest affinity to such an abode.</P>
<P>Whether the animal that now goes by the name of the salamander
be the same with that described by Pliny, is a doubt with me; but this is
not a place for the discussion. It is suf∣ficient to observe, that
the modern salamander is an animal of the lizard kind, and under this name is
comprehended a large tribe that all go by the same name. There have been not
less than seven sorts of this animal described by Seba; and to have
some idea of the peculiarity of their figure, if we suppose the tail of a
lizard applied to the body of a frog, we shall not be far from precision.
The common lizard is long, small <PB N="140" REF="146"/> and taper; the
salamander, like the frog, has its eyes towards the back of the head; like
the frog, its snout is round and not pointed, and its belly thick and
swolen. The claws of its toes are short and feeble; its skin rough; and
the tongue, unlike that of the smallest of the lizard kind, in which it is
long and forked, is short, and adhering to the under jaw.</P>
<P>But it is not in figure that this animal chiefly differs from
the rest of the lizard tribe; for it seems to differ in nature and
conformation. In nature it is unlike, being an heavy, torpid ani∣mal; whereas
the lizard tribe are active, restless, and ever in motion: in conformation
it is un∣like, as the salamander is produced alive from the body of its
parent, and is completely formed the moment of its exclusion. It differs from
them also in its general reputation of being ve∣nomous; however, no trials
that have been hi∣therto made seem to confirm the truth of the report.</P>
<P>Not only this, but many others of the lizard tribe are said to
have venom; but it were to be wished that mankind, for their own happiness,
would examine into the foundation of this re∣proach. By that means many of
them, that are now shunned and detested, might be found in∣offensive;
their figure, instead of exciting either <PB N="141" REF="147"/> horror or
disgust, would then only tend to ani∣mate the general scene of nature;
and specu∣lation might examine their manners in con∣fidence and security.
Certain it is, that all of the lizard kind with which we are acquainted in this
country, are perfectly harmless; and it is equally true that, for a long
time, till our prejudices were removed, we considered not only the Newt, but
the Snake and the Blind∣worm, as fraught with the most destructive
poison. At present we have got over these pre∣judices; and, it is
probable, that, if other nations made the same efforts for information, it
would be found, that the malignity of most, if not all, of the lizard tribe,
was only in the imagination.</P>
<P>With respect to the Salamander, the whole tribe, from the
Moron to the Gekko, are said to be venomous to the last degree; yet, when
experiments have been tried, no arts, no pro∣vocations, could excite these
animals to the rage of biting. They seem timid and inoffensive, only living
upon worms and insects; quite destitute of fangs, like the viper; their
teeth are so very small, that they are hardly able to inflict a wound. But
as the teeth are thus in∣capable of offending, the people of the coun∣tries
where they are found have recourse to a venomous slaver, which, they
suppose, issues <PB N="142" REF="148"/> from the animal's mouth; they
also tell us of a venom issuing from the claws: even Linnaeus seems to
acknowledge the fact; but thinks it a probable supposition that this venom
may proceed from their urine.</P>
<P>Of all animals, the Gekko is the most no∣torious for its
powers of mischief: yet, we are told by those who load it with that
calumny, that it is very friendly to man, and though sup∣plied with the
most deadly virulence, is yet never known to bite. It would be absurd in
us, without experience, to pronounce upon the noxious or inoffensive
qualities of animals: yet it is most probable, from an inspection of the
teeth of lizards, and from their inoffensive qua∣lities in Europe, that the
gekko has been un∣justly accused; and that its serpent-like figure has
involved it in one common reproach with serpents.</P>
<P>The salamander best known in Europe, is from eight to eleven
inches long, usually black, spotted with yellow; and when taken in the
hand, feeling cold to a great degree. There are several kinds. Our Black
Water Newt is reckoned among the number. The idle report of its being
inconsumable in fire, has caused many of these poor animals to be burnt;
but we cannot say as philosophical martyrs; since scarce any 
<PB N="143" REF="149"/> philosopher could think it necessary to make the
experiment. When thrown into the fire, the animal is seen to burst with the
heat of its situation, and to eject its fluids. We are gravely told, in the
Philosophical Transactions, that this is a method the animal takes to
extinguish the flames.</P>
<P>When examined internally, the salamander exhibits little
different from other animals of the lizard kind. It is furnished with lungs
that sometimes serve for the offices of breathing; with a heart that has
its communications open, so that the animal cannot easily be drowned. The
ovary in the female is double the size of what it is in others of this tribe;
and the male is furnished with four testiculi instead of two. But what
deserves particular notice is the manner of this animal's bringing forth its
young alive<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Acta Hafniensia. ann. 1676.
Observ. 11. Memoires de l'Academie Royale de Sciences. tom. iii. part. 3, p.
80.</BIBL></NOTE>. 
<Q REND="inline">"The salamander," says my author, "begins to
shew itself in spring, and chiefly during heavy rains. When the warm
weather re∣turns, it disappears; and never leaves its hole, during either
great heats or severe colds, both which it equally fears. When taken in the
hand, it appears like a lump of ice; it consequently loves the shade, and
is found <PB N="144" REF="150"/> at the feet of old trees surrounded with
brush∣wood at the bottom. It is fond of running along new plowed grounds;
probably to seek for worms, which are its ordinary food. One of these,"
continues my author, "I took alive some years ago in a ditch that had been
lately made. I laid it at the foot of the stairs upon coming home, and there
it disgorged from the throat a <HI>worm</HI> three inches long, that lived
for an hour after, though wounded as I suppose by the teeth of the animal.
I afterwards cut up another of these lizards, and saw not less than fifty
young ones, re∣sembling the parent, come from its womb, all alive, and
actively running about the room."</Q> It were to be wished the author had
used another word beside that of <HI>worm</HI>; as we now are in doubt
whether he means a real worm, or a young animal of the lizard species: had he
been more explicit, and had it appeared that it was a real young lizard, which
I take to be his meaning, we might here see a wonder of Nature, brought to
the proof which many have asserted, and many have thought proper to
deny:—I mean the refuge which the young of the shark, the lizard, and
the viper kinds, are said to take, by running down the throat of the parent,
and there finding a temporary security. <PB N="145" REF="151"/> The fact
indeed, seems a little extraordinary; and yet it is so frequently
attested by some, and even believed by others, whose authority is
re∣spectable, among the number of whom we find Mr. Penant, that the argument
of strangeness must give way to the weight of authority.</P>
<P>However this be, there is no doubt of the animal's being
viviparous, and producing above fifty at a time. They come from the parent in
full perfection, and quickly leave her to shift for themselves. These
animals, in the lower ranks of nature, want scarce any help when excluded;
they soon complete the little circle of their education; and in a day or two
are capable of practising all the arts of subsistence and evasion
practised by their kind.</P>
<P>They are all amphibious, or at least are found capable of
subsisting in either element, when placed there: if those taken from
land are put into water, they continue there in seeming health; and, on the
contrary, those taken from the water will live upon land. In water, however,
they exhibit a greater variety in their appearance; and what is equally
won∣derful with the rest of their history, during the whole spring and
summer this water lizard changes its skin every fourth or fifth day; and
during the winter every fifteen days. This <PB N="146" REF="152"/> operation
they perform by means of the mouth and the claws; and it seems a work of no
small difficulty and pain. The cast skins are fre∣quently seen floating
on the surface of the water: they are sometimes seen also with a part
of their old skin still sticking to one of their limbs, which they have
not been able to get rid of; and thus, like a man with a boot half drawn, in
some measure crippled in their own spoils. This also often corrupts,
and the leg drops off; but the animal does not seem to feel the want of it,
for the loss of a limb to all the lizard kind is but a trifling calamity.
They can live several hours even after the loss of their head: and for
some time under dissection, all the parts of this animal seem to retain
life: but the tail is the part that longest retains its motion. Salt seems
to be much more efficacious in destroying these animals, than the knife;
for, upon being sprink∣led with it, the whole body emits a viscous li∣quor,
and the lizard dies in three minutes, in great agonies.</P>
<P>The whole of the lizard kind are also te∣nacious of life in
another respect, and the sala∣mander among the number. They sustain the
want of food in a surprizing manner. One of them, brought from the Indies,
lived nine months, without any other food than what it <PB N="147" REF="153"/>
received from licking a piece of earth on which it was brought over<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Phil. Trans. ann. 1661. N. 21. art. 7.</BIBL></NOTE>:
another was kept by Seba in an empty vial for six months, with∣out any
nourishment; and Redi talks of a large one, brought from Africa, that lived
for eight months, without taking any nourish∣ment whatever. Indeed, as many
of this kind, both salamanders and lizards, are torpid, or nearly so,
during the winter, the loss of their appetite for so long a time is the
less surprizing.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VII. Of the Cameleon, the Iguana, and Lizards of
different Kinds.</HEAD>
<P>IT were to be wished that animals could be so classed,
that by the very mentioning their rank, we should receive some insight
into their history. This I have endeavoured in most in∣stances; but in
the present chapter all method is totally unserviceable. Here
distribution gives no general ideas: for some of the animals to be here
mentioned produce by eggs; some by spawn; and some are viviparous. The
peculiar manner of propagating in each, is very in∣distinctly known. The
Iguana and the Came∣leon, we know bring forth eggs; some others also
produce in the same manner: but of the rest, which naturalists make
amount to above fifty, we have but very indistinct information.</P>
<P>In the former divisions of this tribe, we had to observe
upon animals, formidable from their size, or disgusting from their
frog-like head and appearance; in the present division, all the animals are
either beautiful to the eye, or grateful to the appetite. The lizards, properly
so called, are beautifully painted and mottled; <PB N="149" REF="155"/> their
frolicsome agility is amusing to those who are familiar with their
appearance; and the great affection which some of them shew to man,
should, in some measure, be repaid with kind∣ness. Others, such as
the Iguana, though not possessed of beauty, are very serviceable,
fur∣nishing one of the most luxurious feasts the tropical climates can
boast of. Those treated of before were objects of curiosity, because
they were apparently objects of danger: most of those here mentioned have
either use or beauty to engage us.</P>
<P>Directly descending from the crocodile, we find the Cordyle,
the Tockay and the Teju∣guacu, all growing less in order, as I have named
them. These fill up the chasm to be found between the crocodile and the
African iguana.</P>
<P>The Iguana, which deserves our notice, is about five feet
long, and the body about as thick as one's thigh: the skin is covered with
small scales, like those of a serpent; and the back is furnished with
a row of prickles, that stand up, like the teeth of a saw: the eyes seem
to be but half opened, except when the animal is angry, and then they appear
large and sparkling: both the jaws are full of very sharp teeth, and the
bite is dangerous though <PB N="150" REF="156"/> not venomous, for it never lets
loose till it is killed. The male has a skin hanging under his throat,
which reaches down to his breast; and, when displeased, he puffs it up
like a bladder: he is one third larger and stronger than the fe∣male; though
the strength of either avails them little towards their defence. The males
are ash-coloured, and the females are green.</P>
<P>The flesh of these may be considered as the greatest
delicacy of Africa and America; and the sportsmen of those climates go
out to hunt the iguana, as we do in pursuit of the pheasant or the hare. In
the beginning of the season, when the great floods of the tropical climates
are past away, and vegetation starts into uni∣versal verdure, the
sportsmen are seen, with a nooze and a stick, wandering along the
sides of the rivers, to take the iguana. This animal, though apparently
formed for combat, is the most harmless creature of all the forest; it
lives among the trees, or sports in the water, without ever offering to
offend: there, having fed upon the flowers of the mahot, and the leaves of the
mapou, that grow along the banks of the stream, it goes to repose upon the
branches of the trees that hang over the water. Upon land the animal is swift
of foot; but when once in pos∣session of a tree, it seems conscious
of the secu∣rity <PB N="151" REF="157"/> of its situation, and never offers
to stir. There the sportsman easily finds it, and as easily fastens
his nooze round its neck: if the head be placed in such a manner that the
nooze cannot readily be fastened, by hitting the animal a blow on the nose
with the stick, it lifts the head, and offers it in some measure to the
nooze. In this manner, and also by the tail, the iguana is dragged from the
trees, and killed by repeat∣ed blows on the head.</P>
<P>The Cameleon is a very different animal; and as the iguana
satisfies the appetites of the epicure, this is rather the feast of the
philosopher. Like the crocodile, this little animal proceeds from an egg; and
it also nearly resembles that for∣midable creature in form: but it differs
widely in its size and its appetites; being not above eleven inches long, and
delighting to sit upon trees, being afraid of serpents, from which it is
unable to escape on the ground.</P>
<P>The head of a large cameleon is almost two inches long; and
from thence to the beginning of the tail, four and an half: the tail is five
inches long, and the feet two and an half: the thickness of the body is
different at different times; for sometimes, from the back to the belly, it
is two inches, and sometimes but one; for it can blow itself up, and
contract itself, at <PB N="152" REF="158"/> pleasure. This swelling and
contraction is not only of the back and belly, but of the legs and tail.</P>
<P>These different tumours do not proceed from a dilatation of
the breast in breathing, which rises and falls by turns; but are very
irregular, and seem adopted merely from caprice. The ca∣meleon is often
seen, as it were, blown up for two hours together; and then it continues
growing less and less insensibly; for the dilatation is always more
quick and visible than the contraction. In this last state the animal
ap∣pears extremely lean; the spine of the back seems sharp, and all the
ribs may be counted; likewise the tendons of the legs and arms may be seen
very distinctly.</P>
<P>This method of puffing itself up, is similar to that in
pigeons, whose crops are sometimes greatly distended with air. The
cameleon has a power of driving the air it breathes over every part of the
body: however, it only gets between the skin and the muscles; for the
muscles them∣selves are never swolen. The skin is very cold to the
touch; and though the animal seems so lean, there is no feeling the beating
of the heart. The surface of the skin is unequal, and has a grain not
unlike shagreen, but very soft, be∣cause each eminence is as smooth as
if it were <PB N="153" REF="159"/> polished. Some of these little
protuberances are as large as a pin's head, on the arms, legs, belly and tail;
but on the shoulders and head they are of an oval figure, and a little
larger: those under the throat are ranged in the form of a chaplet, from the
lower lip to the breast. The colour of all these eminences, when the
cameleon is at rest in a shady place, is of a bluish grey, and the
spaces between is of a pale red and yellow.</P>
<P>But when the animal is removed into the sun, then comes the
wonderful part of its history. At first it appears to suffer no change of
colour, its greyish spots still continuing the same: but the whole
surface soon seems to imbibe the rays of light; and the simple
colouring of the body changes into a variety of beautiful hues. Wherever the
light comes upon the body, it is of a tawny brown; but that part of the skin
on which the sun does not shine, changes into se∣veral brighter colours,
pale yellow, or vivid crimson; which form spots of the size of half one's
finger: some of these descend from the spine half way down the back;
and others appear on the sides, arms and tail. When the sun has done
shining, the original grey colour returns by degrees, and covers all the
body. Sometimes the animal becomes all over <PB N="154" REF="160"/> spotted
with brown spots, of a greenish cast. When it is wrapped up in a white
linen cloth for two or three minutes, the natural colour becomes much lighter;
but not quite white, as some authors have pretended: however, from hence it
must not be concluded that the ca∣meleon assumes the colour of the
objects which it approaches; this is entirely an error, and pro∣bably has taken
its rise from the continual changes it appears to undergo.</P>
<P>Le Bruyn, in his Voyage to the Levant, has given us a very ample
description of the came∣leon. During his stay at Smyrna, he bought
several of this kind, and, to try how long they could live, kept four of them
in a cage, per∣mitting them at times to run about the house. The fresh
sea-breeze seemed to give them most spirits and vivacity; they opened
their mouths to take it in: he never perceived that they eat any thing, except
now and then a fly, which they took half an hour to swallow: he observed
their colour often to change, three or four times successively, without
being able to find out any cause for such alterations: their common colour
he found to be grey, or rather a pale mouse colour; but its most frequent
changes were into a beautiful green, spotted with yellow: some∣times the
animal was marked all over with dark <PB N="155" REF="161"/> brown; and this
often changed into a lighter brown: some colours, however, it never
as∣sumed; and, contrary to what was said above, he found red to be among
the number.</P>
<P>Though our traveller took the utmost care, he was unable to
preserve any of them alive above five months; and many of them died in four.
When the cameleon changes place, and attempts to descend from an eminence, it
moves with the utmost precaution, advancing one leg very deliberately before
the other, still securing itself by holding whatever it can grasp by
the tail. It seldom opens the mouth, except for fresh air; and when that is
supplied, discovers its satisfaction by its motions, and the frequent
changes of its colour. The tongue is sometimes darted out after its prey,
which is flies; and this is as long as the whole body. The eyes are remarkably
little, though they stand out of the head: they have a single eye-lid, like
a cap with a hole in the middle, through which the sight of the eye appears,
which is of a shining brown; and round it there is a little circle of a gold
colour: but the most extraordinary part of their conformation is, that the
animal often moves one eye, when the other is entirely at rest; nay,
sometimes one eye will seem to look directly forward, while the other looks
back∣ward; <PB N="156" REF="162"/> and one will look upwards, while the other
regards the earth.</P>
<P>To this class of lizards, we may refer the Dragon, a most
terrible animal, but most pro∣bably not of Nature's formation. Of this
death-dealing creature all people have read; and the most barbarous
countries, to this day, paint it to the imagination in all its terrors, and
fear to meet it in every forest. It is not enough that Nature has furnished
those countries with poi∣sons of various malignity; with serpents forty
feet long; with elephants, lions and tigers, to make their situation really
dangerous; the ca∣pricious imagination is set at work to call up new terrors;
and scarce a savage is found, that does not talk of winged serpents of
immoderate length, flying away with the camel or the rhino∣ceros, or
destroying mankind by a single glare. Happily, however, such ravagers are
no where found to exist at present; and the whole race of dragons is
dwindled down to the Flying Lizard, a little harmless creature, that only
preys upon insects, and even seems to embellish the forest with its
beauty.</P>
<P>The Flying Lizard of Java perches upon fruit-trees, and feeds
upon flies, ants, but∣terflies, and other small insects. It is a very
harmless creature, and does no mischief in <PB N="157" REF="163"/> any
respect. Gentil, in his Voyage round the World, affirms, that he has seen
these lizards, at the island of Java, in the East Indies. He observed
they flew very swiftly from tree to tree; and having killed one, he could not
but admire the skin, which was painted with several beautiful colours: it
was a foot in length, and had four paws, like the common lizards; but its head
was flat, and had a small hole in the middle; the wings were very thin, and
resembled those of a flying fish. About the neck were a sort of
wattles, not unlike those of cocks, which gave it no disagreeable
appearance. He intended to have preserved it, in order to bring it into
Europe; but it was corrupted by the heat, before the close of the day:
however, they have since been brought into England, and are now com∣mon
enough in the cabinets of the curious.</P>
<P>The last animal of the lizard kind that I shall mention, is
the Chalcidian Lizard of Aldro∣vandus, very improperly called the Seps, by
modern historians. This animal seems to make the shade that separates
the lizard from the serpent race. It has four legs, like the lizard; but so
short, as to be utterly unserviceable in walking: it has a long slender
body, like the serpent; and it is said to have the serpent's ma∣lignity
also. The fore legs are very near the <PB N="158" REF="164"/> head; the hind
legs are placed far backward; but before and behind they seem rather
useless incumbrances, than instruments serving to assist the
animal in its motions, or in providing for its subsistence. These
animals are found above three feet long, and thick in proportion, with a large
head and pointed snout. The whole body is covered with scales; and the
belly is white, mixed with blue. It has four crooked teeth; as also a pointed
tail, which, however, can inflict no wound. Whether the teeth be similar to
the viper's fangs, we are not told; though Volateranus says, they are covered
with a membrane; by which I am apt to think he means a venom-bag, which is
found at the root of the teeth of all serpents that are poi∣sonous. It is
viviparous; fifteen young ones having been taken alive out of its belly. Upon
the whole, it appears to bear a strong affinity to the viper; and, like that
animal, its bite may be dangerous.</P>

<PB N="159" REF="165"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. VIII. Of Serpents in General.</HEAD>
<P>WE now come to a tribe that not only their deformity, their
venom, their ready malignity, but also our prejudices, and our very religion,
have taught us to detest. The serpent has from the beginning been the enemy
of man; and it has hitherto continued to terrify and annoy him,
notwithstanding all the arts which have been practised to destroy it.
Formidable in itself, it deters the invader from the pursuit; and from its
figure capable of finding shelter in a little space, it is not easily
discovered by those who would venture to try the encounter. Thus
possessed at once of potent arms and inaccessible or secure
retreats, it baffles all the arts of man though never so earnestly bent
upon its de∣struction.</P>
<P>For this reason, there is scarce a country in the world that
does not still give birth to this poisonous brood, that seem formed to
quell human pride, and repress the boasts of security. Mankind have
driven the lion, the tiger and the wolf from their vicinity; but the snake
and the viper still defy their power, and frequently punish their
insolence.</P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="166"/>Their numbers, however, are thinned by
human assiduity; and it is possible some of the kinds are wholly
destroyed. In none of the countries of Europe are they sufficiently
nume∣rous to be truly terrible; the philosopher can meditate in the fields
without danger, and the lover seek the grove without fearing any wounds but
those of metaphor. The various malignity that has been ascribed to European
serpents of old, is now utterly unknown; there are not above three or four
kinds that are dangerous, and their poison operates in all in the same
manner. A burning pain in the part, easily re∣movable by timely applications,
is the worst effect that we experience from the bite of the most venomous
serpents of Europe. The drowsy death, the starting of the blood from
every pore, the insatiable and burning thirst, the melting down the solid
mass of the whole form into one heap of putrefaction, these are horrors
with which we are entirely unacquainted.</P>
<P>But though we have thus reduced these dan∣gers, having been
incapable of wholly remov∣ing them, in other parts of the world they still
rage with all their ancient malignity. Nature seems to have placed them as
centinels to deter mankind from spreading too widely, and from seeking new
abodes till they have thoroughly <PB N="161" REF="167"/> cultivated those at
home. In the warm coun∣tries that lie within the tropic, as well as in the cold
regions of the north, where the inhabitants are few, the serpents propagate
in equal pro∣portion. But of all countries, those regions have them in the
greatest abundance where the fields are unpeopled and fertile, and where the
climate supplies warmth and humidity. All along the swampy banks of the
river Niger or Oroonoko, where the sun is hot, the forests thick, and the
men but few, the serpents cling among the branches of the trees in infinite
num∣bers, and carry on an unceasing war against all other animals in their
vicinity. Travellers have assured us that they have often seen large
snakes twining round the trunk of a tall tree, encom∣passing it like a
wreath, and thus rising and de∣scending at pleasure. In these
countries, there∣fore, the serpent is too formidable to become an object of
curiosity, for it excites much more violent sensations.</P>
<P>We are not, therefore, to reject as wholly fa∣bulous, the
accounts left us by the ancients of the terrible devastations committed by a
single ser∣pent. It is probable, in early times, when the arts were little
known, and mankind were but thinly scattered over the earth, that serpents,
conti∣nuing undisturbed possessors of the forest, grew 
<PB N="162" REF="168"/> to an amazing magnitude; and every other tribe of
animals fell before them. It then might have happened, that serpents reigned
the tyrants of a district for centuries together. To animals of this kind,
grown by time and rapacity to an hundred or an hundred and fifty feet in
length, the lion, the tiger, and even the elephant itself, were but feeble
opponents. The dreadful mon∣ster spread desolation round him; every
creature that had life was devoured, or fled to a distance. That horrible
<HI>faetor</HI> which even the commonest and the most harmless snakes
are still found to diffuse, might, in these larger ones, become too
powerful for any living being to withstand; and while they preyed without
distinction, they might thus also have poisoned the atmosphere around
them. In this manner, having for ages lived in the hidden and unpeopled
forest, and finding, as their appetites were more powerful, the quantity of
their prey decreasing, it is possible they might venture boldly from
their retreats, into the more cultivated parts of the country, and carry
consternation among mankind, as they had before desolation among the lower
ranks of nature. We have many histories of antiquity, presenting us such
a picture; and exhibiting a whole nation sinking under the ravages of a
single serpent. At that time man had not learned the art of uniting the
efforts of <PB N="163" REF="169"/> many, to effect one great purpose.
Opposing multitudes only added new victims to the ge∣neral calamity, and
encreased mutual embar∣rassment and terror. The animal was therefore to
be singly opposed by him who had the greatest strength, the best
armour, and the most un∣daunted courage. In such an encounter, hun∣dreds
must have fallen; till one, more lucky than the rest, by a fortunate blow,
or by taking the monster in its torpid interval, and surcharged with
spoil, might kill, and thus rid his country of the destroyer. Such was the
original oc∣cupation of heroes; and those who first obtained that name,
from their destroying the ravagers of the earth, gained it much more
deservedly than their successors, who acquired their repu∣tation only
for their skill in destroying each other. But as we descend into more
enlightened anti∣quity, we find these animals less formidable, as being
attacked in a more successful manner. We are told, that while Regulus led
his army along the banks of the river Bagrada in Africa, an enormous serpent
disputed his passage over. We are assured by Pliny, who says that
he himself saw the skin, that it was an hundred and twenty feet long, and
that it had destroyed many of the army. At last, however, the battering
engines were brought out against it; and these assailing 
<PB N="164" REF="170"/> it at a distance, it was soon destroyed. Its
spoils were carried to Rome, and the general was de∣creed an ovation for his
success. There are, perhaps, few facts better ascertained in history
than this: an ovation was a remarkable honour; and was given only for some
signal exploit, that did not deserve a triumph: no historian would offer
to invent that part of the story at least, without being subject to the
most shameful de∣tection. The skin was kept for several years after in
the Capitol; and Pliny says, he saw it there: now, though Pliny was a
credulous writer, he was by no means a <HI>false</HI> one; and whatever he
says he has seen, we may very safely rely on. At present, indeed,
such ravages from serpents are scarce seen in any part of the world;
not but that in Africa and America, some of them are powerful enough to brave
the assaults of men to this day.</P>
<P>But happily for us, we are placed at such a distance as to
take a view of this tribe, without fearing for our safety; we can survey
their impo∣tent malignity with the same delight with which the poet
describes the terrors of a dead monster. 
<Q> 
<L>Nequeunt expleri corda tuendo</L> 
<L>Terribles occulos villosaque setis pectore.</L></Q> To
us their slender form, their undulating motion, their vivid colouring, their
horrid stench, their forky tongue, and their envenomed <PB N="165" REF="171"/>
fangs, are totally harmless; and in this country their uses even serve to
counterbalance the mis∣chief they sometimes occasion.</P>
<P>If we take a survey of serpents in general, they have marks
by which they are distinguished from all the rest of animated nature.
They have the length and the suppleness of the eel, but want fins to swim
with; they have the scaly covering and pointed tail of the lizard, but they
want legs to walk with; they have the crawling motion of the worm, but, unlike
that animal, they have lungs to breathe with: like all the reptile kind, they
are resentful when of∣fended; and Nature has supplied them with terrible
arms to revenge every injury.</P>
<P>Though they are possessed of very different degrees of
malignity, yet they are all formidable to man, and have a strong similitude
of form to each other; and it will be proper to mark the general characters
before we descend to par∣ticulars. With respect to their conformation, all
serpents have a very wide mouth, in pro∣portion to the size of the head;
and what is very extraordinary, they can gape and swallow the head of another
animal which is three times as big as their own. I have seen a toad taken out
of the belly of a snake, at Lord Spencer's, near London, the body of which
was thrice the <PB N="166" REF="172"/> diameter of the animal that swallowed
it. How∣ever, it is no way surprizing that the skin of the snake should
stretch to receive so large a morsel; the wonder seems how the jaws
could take it in. To explain this, it must be observed that the jaws of
this animal do not open as ours, in the manner of a pair of hinges, where bones
are applied to bones and play upon one another; on the contrary, the
serpent's jaws are held together at the roots by a stretching muscular
skin; by which means they open as widely as the animal chuses to stretch
them, and admit of a prey much thicker than the snake's own body. The throat,
like stretching leather, dilates to admit the morsel; the stomach
receives it in part; and the rest remains in the gullet, till putrefac∣tion
and the juices of the serpent's body unite to dissolve it.</P>
<P>As to the teeth, I will talk more of them when I come to treat
of the viper's poison; it will be sufficient here to observe, that some
serpents have fangs, or canine teeth, and others are without them. The teeth
in all are crooked and hollow; and, by a peculiar contrivance, are capable of
being erected or depressed at pleasure.</P>
<P>The eyes of all serpents are small, if compared to the
length of the body; and though dif∣ferently coloured in different kinds, yet
the <PB N="167" REF="173"/> appearance of all is malign and heavy; and from
their known qualities, they strike the imagination with the idea of a
creature me∣ditating mischief. In some, the upper eye-lid is wanting, and
the serpent winks only with that below; in others, the animal has a
nicti∣tating membrane or skin, resembling that which is found in birds,
which keeps the eye clean and preserves the sight. The substance of the
eye in all is hard and horny; the chry∣staline humour occupying a great part
of the globe.</P>
<P>The holes for hearing are very visible in all: but there are
no conduits for smelling; though it is probable that some of them enjoy
that sense in tolerable perfection.</P>
<P>The tongue in all these animals is long and forky. It is
composed of two long fleshy sub∣stances, which terminate in sharp
points, and are very pliable. At the root it is connected very strongly to
the neck by two tendons, that give it a variety of play. Some of the viper kind
have tongues a fifth part of the length of their bodies; they are continually
darting them out, but they are entirely harmless, and only terrify those
who are ignorant of the real situa∣tion of their poison.</P>
<P>If from the jaws we go on to the gullet, we 
<PB N="168" REF="174"/> shall find it very wide for the animal's size, and
capable of being distended to a great degree; at the bottom of this lies the
stomach, which is not so capacious, and receives only a part of the prey,
while the rest continues in the gullet for digestion. When the
substance in the sto∣mach is dissolved into chyle, it passes into
the intestines, and from thence goes to nourishment, or to be excluded by
the vent.</P>
<P>Like most other animals, serpents are fur∣nished with
lungs, which I suppose are service∣able in breathing, though we cannot
perceive the manner in which this operation is per∣formed; for though
serpents are often seen ap∣parently to draw in their breath, yet we cannot
find the smallest signs of their ever respiring it again. Their lungs
however are long and large, and doubtless are necessary to promote their
languid circulation. The heart is formed as in the tortoise, the frog, and
the lizard kinds, so as to work without the assistance of the lungs. It
is single, the greatest part of the blood flowing from the great vein to
the great artery by the shortest course. By this contrivance of Nature we
easily gather two consequences; that snakes are amphibious, being equally
capable of living on land and in the water; and, that also they are torpid in
winter, like the bat, the <PB N="169" REF="175"/> lizard, and other animals
formed in the same manner.</P>
<P>The vent in these animals serves for the emission of the
urine and the faeces, and for the purposes of generation. The instrument of
generation in the male is double, being forked like the tongue; the ovaries in
the female are double also; and the aperture is very large, in order to
receive the double instrument of the male. They copulate in their retreats;
and it is said by the ancients, that in this situation they appear like one
serpent with two heads; but how far this remark is founded in truth, I do not
find any of the moderns that can resolve me.</P>
<P>As the body of this animal is long, slender, and capable of
bending in every direction, the number of joints in the back-bone are numerous
beyond what one would imagine. In the gene∣rality of quadrupedes, they amount
to not above thirty or forty; in the serpent kind they amount to an hundred
and forty-five from the head to the vent, and twenty-five more from that to the
tail<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Vide Charat. Anatom.</BIBL></NOTE>. The
number of these joints must give the back-bone a surprizing degree of
pliancy; but this is still encreased by the manner in which each of these
joints are locked into the <PB N="170" REF="176"/> other. In man and
quadrupedes, the flat sur∣faces of the bones are laid one against the
other, and bound tight by sinews; but in serpents the bones play one within
the other like ball and socket, so that they have full motion upon each
other in every direction<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Derham, p.
396.</BIBL></NOTE>. Thus if a man were to form a machine composed of so
many joints as are found in the back of a serpent, he would find it no easy
matter to give it such strength and pliancy at the same time. The chain
of a watch is but a bungling piece of workmanship in comparison.</P>
<P>Though the number of joints in the back∣bone is great, yet that
of the ribs is still greater; for, from the head to the vent, there are two
ribs to every joint, which makes their number two hundred and ninety in all.
These ribs are furnished with muscles; four in number; which being
inserted into the head, run along to the end of the tail, and give the animal
great strength and agility in all its motions.</P>
<P>The skin also contributes to its motions, being composed
of a number of scales, united to each other by a transparent membrane,
which grows harder as it grows older, until the animal changes, which is
generally done twice a year. This cover then bursts near the head, and the
serpent <PB N="171" REF="177"/> creeps from it, by an undulatory motion, in a
new skin, much more vivid than the former. If the old slough be then
viewed, every scale will be distinctly seen, like a piece of net-work,
and will be found greatest where the part of the body they covered was
largest.</P>
<P>There is much geometrical neatness in the disposal of the
serpent's scales, for assisting the animal's sinuous motion. As the
edges of the foremost scales lie over the ends of their following scales,
so those edges, when the scales are erected, which the animal has a power
of doing in a small degree, catch in the ground, like the nails in the wheel
of a chariot, and so promote and facilitate the animal's progressive
motion. The erecting these scales is by means of a multitude of distinct
muscles, with which each is supplied, and one end of which is tacked each
to the middle of the foregoing.</P>
<P>In some of the serpent kind there is the ex∣actest
symmetry in these scales; in others they are disposed more
irregularly. In some there are larger scales on the belly, and often
an∣swering to the number of ribs; in others, how∣ever, the animal is without
them. Upon this slight difference, Linnaeus has founded his di∣stinctions
of the various classes of the serpent tribe. Human curiosity, however,
and even human in∣terest, <PB N="172" REF="178"/> seem to plead for a very
different method of distribution. It is not the number of scales on a
formidable animal's belly, nor their mag∣nitude or variety, that any way excite
our con∣cern. The first question that every man will naturally ask, when
he hears of a snake, is, whether it be large: the second, whether it be
venomous? In other words, the strongest lines in the animal's history are
those that first excite our attention; and these it is every
historian's business to display.</P>
<P>When we come to compare serpents with each other, the first
great distinction appears in their size; no other tribe of animals
differing so widely in this particular. What, for instance, can be so
remotely separated as the Great Ly∣boija of Surinam, that grows to
thirty-six feet long; and the Little Serpent, at the Cape of Good Hope and
the north of the river Senegal, that is not above three inches, and covers
whole sandy desarts with its multitudes! This tribe of animals, like that
of fishes, seems to have no bounds put to their growth: their bones are in
great measure cartilaginous, and they are con∣sequently capable of great
extension; the older, therefore, a serpent becomes, the larger it grows;
and as they seem to live to a great age, they arrive at an enormous
size.</P>
<P><PB N="173" REF="179"/>Leguat assures us, that he saw one
in Java, that was fifty feet long. Carli mentions their growing to above forty
feet; and we have now the skin of one in the Musaeum, that measures
thirty-two. Mr. Wentworth, who had large concerns in the Brebices in America,
assures me, that, in that country, they grow to an enormous length. He one
day sent out a sol∣dier, with an Indian, to kill wild fowl for the table;
and they accordingly went some miles from the fort: in pursuing their game,
the In∣dian, who generally marched before, beginning to tire, went to rest
himself upon the fallen trunk of a tree, as he supposed it to be; but
when he was just going to sit down, the enor∣mous monster began to move,
and the poor savage perceiving that he had approached a Li∣boya, the
greatest of all the serpent kind, dropped down in an agony. The soldier,
who perceived at some distance what had hap∣pened, levelled at the
serpents head, and, by a lucky aim, shot it dead: however he con∣tinued his
fire until he was assured that the ani∣mal was killed; and then going up to
rescue his companion, who was fallen motionless by its side, he, to his
astonishment, found him dead likewise, being killed by the fright. Upon
his return to the fort, and telling what had hap∣pened, <PB N="174" REF="180"/>
Mr. Wentworth ordered the animal to be brought up, when it was measured, and
found to be thirty-six feet long. He had the skin stuffed, and then
sent to Europe, as a pre∣sent to the Prince of Orange, in whose cabinet
it is now to be seen at the Hague; but the skin has shrunk, by drying,
two or three feet.</P>
<P>In the East Indies they grow also to an enormous size;
particularly in the Island of Java, where, we are assured, that one of
them will destroy and devour a buffalo. In a letter, printed in the German
Ephemerides, we have an account of a combat between an enormous serpent and a
buffalo, by a person, who assures us, that he was himself a
spectator. The ser∣pent had for some time been waiting near the brink of
a pool, in expectation of its prey; when a buffalo was the first that
offered. Hav∣ing darted upon the affrighted animal, it in∣stantly began to
wrap it round with its volu∣minous twistings; and at every twist the bones
of the buffalo were heard to crack almost as loud as the report of a cannon.
It was in vain that the poor animal struggled and bellowed; its enormous
enemy entwined it too closely to get free; till at length, all its bones
being mashed to pieces, like those of a malefactor on the wheel, and the
whole body reduced to one <PB N="175" REF="181"/> uniform mass, the serpent
untwined its folds to swallow its prey at leisure. To prepare for this, and
in order to make the body slip down the throat more glibly, it was seen to
lick the whole body over, and thus cover it with its mucous. It then began to
swallow it at that end that offered least resistance; while its length
of body was dilated to receive its prey, and thus took in at once a morsel
that was three times its own thickness. We are assured by travellers,
that these animals are often found with the body of a stag in their gullet,
while the horns, which they are unable to swallow, keep sticking out at
their mouths.</P>
<P>But it is happy for mankind that the rapacity of these
frightful creatures is often their punish∣ment; for whenever any of the
serpent kind have gorged themselves in this manner, when∣ever their body is
seen particularly distended with food, they then become torpid, and may be
approached and destroyed with safety. Pa∣tient of hunger to a surprizing
degree, when∣ever they seize and swallow their prey, they seem, like
surfeited gluttons, unwieldy, stupid, helpless, and sleepy: they at
that time seek some retreat, where they may lurk for several days
together, and digest their meal in safety: the smallest effort at that
time is capable of de∣stroying them; they can scarce make any
resist∣ance; <PB N="176" REF="182"/> and they are equally unqualified for
flight or opposition: that is the happy opportunity of attacking them with
success; at that time the naked Indian himself does not fear to
assail them. But it is otherwise when this sleepy in∣terval of
digestion is over; they then issue, with famished appetites, from their
retreats, and with accumulated terrors, while every ani∣mal of the forest
flies before them.</P>
<P>Carli describes the Long Serpent of Congo, making its track
through the tall grass, like mowers in a summer's day. He could not
with∣out terror behold whole lines of grass lying le∣velled under the sweep
of its tail. In this man∣ner it moved forward with great rapidity, until it
found a proper situation frequented by its prey: there it continued to lurk,
in patient ex∣pectation, and would have remained for weeks together, had it not
been disturbed by the natives.</P>
<P>Other creatures have a choice in their pro∣vision; but the
serpent indiscriminately preys upon all; the buffalo, the tiger, and the
gazelle. One would think that the porcupine's quills might be sufficient to
protect it; but whatever has life, serves to appease the hunger of these
devouring creatures: porcupines, with all their quills, have frequently been
found in their sto∣machs, when killed and opened; nay, they most frequently
are seen to devour each other.</P>
<P><PB N="177" REF="183"/>A life of savage hostility in the
forest, offers the imagination one of the most tremendous pictures in
nature. In those burning countries, where the sun dries up every brook for
hundreds of miles round; when what had the appearance of a great river in the
rainy season, becomes, in summer, one dreary bed of sand; in those
countries, I say, a lake that is never dry, or a brook that is perennial, is
considered by every animal as the greatest convenience of nature. As to
food, the luxuriant landscape supplies that in sufficient abundance: it
is the want of water that all animals endeavour to remove; and inwardly parched
by the heat of the cli∣mate, traverse whole desarts to find out a spring.
When they have discovered this, no dangers can deter them from attempting to
slake their thirst. Thus the neighbourhood of a rivulet, in the heart of
the tropical continents, is generally the place where all the hostile tribes
of nature draw up for the engagement. On the banks of this little envied
spot, thousands of animals of va∣rious kinds are seen venturing to quench
their thirst, or preparing to seize their prey. The elephants are perceived
in a long line, marching from the darker parts of the forest; the buffalos
are there, depending upon numbers for security; the gazells relying solely
upon their swiftness; <PB N="178" REF="184"/> the lion and tiger waiting a
proper opportunity to seize; but chiefly the larger serpents are upon guard
there, and defend the accesses of the lake. Not an hour passes without
some dread∣ful combat; but the serpent, defended by its scales, and
naturally capable of sustaining a multitude of wounds, is, of all others,
the most formidable. It is the most wakeful also; for the whole tribe
sleep with their eyes open, and are consequently for ever upon the watch:
so that, till their rapacity is satisfied, few other animals will venture
to approach their station.</P>
<P>But though these animals are, of all others, the most
voracious, and though the morsel which they swallow without chewing, is
greater than what any other creature, either by land or water, the whale
itself not excepted, can devour, yet no animals upon earth bear abstinence
so long as they. A single meal, with many of the snake kind, seems to
be the adventure of a sea∣son; it is an occurrence for which they have been
for weeks, nay sometimes for months, in pa∣tient expectation of. When they
have seized their prey, their industry for several weeks is entirely
discontinued; the fortunate capture of an hour, often satisfies them for
the remaining period of their annual activity. As their blood is colder than
that of most other terrestial ani∣mals, and as it circulates but slowly
through <PB N="179" REF="185"/> their bodies, so their powers of digestion
are but feeble. Their prey continues, for a long time, partly in the stomach,
partly in the gullet; and is often seen a part hanging out of the mouth. In
this manner it digests by degrees; and in proportion as the part below is
dissolved, the part above is taken in. It is not therefore till this
tedious operation is entirely performed, that the serpent renews its appetite
and its activity. But should any accident prevent it from issuing once
more from its cell, it still can continue to bear famine, for weeks, months,
nay for years together. Vipers are often kept in boxes for six or eight
months, without any food whatever; and there are little serpents sometimes
sent over to Europe, from Grand Cairo, the name of which I have not been able
to learn, that live for several years in glasses, and never eat at all,
nor even stain the glass with their excrements. Thus the serpent tribe
unite in themselves two very opposite qualities; won∣derful abstinence,
and yet incredible rapacity.</P>
<P>If leaving the consideration of their appetites, we come to
compare serpents as to their voices, some are found silent, some have a
peculiar cry, but hissing is the sound which they most com∣monly send
forth, either as a call to their kind, or as a threat to their enemies. In the
countries <PB N="180" REF="186"/> where they abound, they are generally silent
in the middle of the day, when they are obliged to retire from the heat of the
climate; but as the cool of the evening approaches, they are then heard
issuing from their cells, with con∣tinued hissings; and such is the
variety of their notes, that some have assured me they very much
resemble the music of an English grove. This, some will hardly credit:
at any rate, such notes, however pleasing, can give but very little
de∣light, when we call to mind the malignity of the minstrel. If considered
indeed, as they answer the animal's own occasions, they will be found well
adapted to its nature, and fully an∣swering the purposes of terrifying
such as would venture to offend it.</P>
<P>With respect to motion, some serpents, par∣ticularly
those of the viper kind, move slowly; while others, such as the
Ammodytes, dart with amazing swiftness. The motion in all is similar; but
the strength of body in some gives a very different appearance. The viper,
that is but a slow, feeble-bodied animal, makes way in a heavy undulating
manner; advancing its head, then drawing up its tail behind, and bending the
body into a bow; then from the spot where the head and tail were united,
advancing the head forward as before. This, which is the <PB N="181" REF="187"/>
motion of all serpents, is very different from that of the earth-worm, or the
naked snail. The ser∣pent, as was said above, has a back-bone, with
numerous joints; and this bone the animal has a power of bending in every
direction, but without being able to shorten or lengthen it at pleasure.
The earth-worm, on the other hand, has no back-bone; but its body is composed
of rings, which, like a barber's puff, it can lengthen or shorten as it finds
necessary. The earth-worm, therefore, in order to move forward, lengthens
the body; then, by the fore part clings to the ground, where it has reached,
and then con∣tracts and brings up its rear: then, when the body is thus
shortened, the fore part is length∣ened again for another progression;
and so on. The serpent, instead of shortening the body, bends it into
an arch; and this is the principal difference between serpentine and
vermicular progression.</P>
<P>I have instanced this motion in the viper, as most easily
discerned; but there are many ser∣pents that dart with such amazing
swiftness, that they appear rather to leap than crawl. It is most
probable, however, that no serpent can dart upon even ground farther than its
own length at one effort. Our fears indeed, may encrease the force of their
speed, which is some∣times <PB N="182" REF="188"/> found so fatal. We are
told by some, that they will dart to a very great distance; but this my
enquiries have never been able to ascer∣tain. The manner of progression
in the swiftest serpent we know, which is the Jaculus, is by instantly
coiling itself upon its tail, and darting from thence to its full extent;
then carrying the tail, as quick as lightening, to the head; coiling and
darting again: and by this means proceeding, with extreme rapidity, without
ever quitting the ground. Indeed, if we consider the length and the
weakness of the back-bone in all these animals; if we regard the make of
their vertebrae, in which we shall find the junctures all formed to give
play, and none to give power; we cannot be of opinion that they have a faculty
of springing from the ground, as they entirely want a <HI>fulcrum,</HI> if I
may so express it, from whence to take their spring; the whole body being
composed of unsupported muscles and joints that are yielding. It must
be con∣fessed, that they dart down from trees upon their prey; but their
weight alone is sufficient for that purpose, without much effort of their
own.</P>
<P>Though all serpents are amphibious, some are much fonder of
the water than others; and though destitute of fins or gills, remain at the
bottom, or swim along the surface with great ease. From their internal
structure, just sketched <PB N="183" REF="189"/> above, we see how well
adapted they are for either element; and how capable their blood is of
circulating at the bottom, as freely as in the frog or the tortoise. They
can, however, en∣dure to live in fresh-water only; for salt is an effectual
bane to the whole tribe. The greatest serpents are most usually found
in fresh-water, either chusing it as their favourite element, or finding
their prey in such places in the greatest abundance. But that all will live
and swim in liquids, appears from the experiment of Redi; who put a serpent
into a large glass vessel of wine, where it lived swimming about six
hours; though, when it was by force immersed and kept under that liquid, it
lived only one hour and an half. He put another in common water, where it lived
three days; but when it was kept under water, it lived only about twelve
hours<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Redi, Exper. p. 170.</BIBL></NOTE>. Their
motion there, however, is perfectly the reverse of what it is upon land; for,
in order to support themselves upon an element lighter than their bodies,
they are obliged to encrease their surface in a very artificial manner. On
earth their windings are perpendicular to the surface; in water they are
parallel to it: in other words, if I should wave my hand up and down, it will
give an idea of the animal's progress on land; if <PB N="184" REF="190"/> I
should wave it to the right and left, it will give some idea of its
progress on the water.</P>
<P>Some serpents have a most horrible faetor at∣tending them,
which is alone capable of intimi∣dating the brave. This proceeds from two
glands near the vent, like those in the weasel or polecat; and, like
those animals, in proportion as they are excited by rage or by fear, the
scent grows stronger. It would seem, however, that such serpents as
are most venomous, are least of∣fensive in this particular; since the
rattlesnake and the viper have no smell whatever: nay, we are told, that at
Calecut and Cranganon, in the East Indies, there are some very noxious
ser∣pents, who are so far from being disagreeable, that their excrements
are sought after, and kept as the most pleasing perfume. The Esculapian
Serpent is also of this number.</P>
<P>Some serpents bring forth their young alive; as the viper:
some bring forth eggs, which are hatched by the heat of their situation; as
the Common Black Snake, and the majority of the serpent tribe. When a reader,
ignorant of anatomy, is told, that some of those animals produce their
young alive, and that some pro∣duce eggs only, he is apt to suppose a
very great difference in the internal conformation, which makes such a
variety in the manner of <PB N="185" REF="191"/> bringing forth. But this is not
the case: these animals are internally alike, in whatever manner they
produce their young; and the variety in their bringing forth, is rather a
slight than a real discrimination. The only difference is, that the viper
hatches her eggs, and brings them to maturity within her body; the snake is
more premature in her productions, and sends her eggs into the light, some
time before the young ones are capable of leaving the shell. Thus, if either
are opened, the eggs will be found in the womb, covered with their mem∣branous
shell, and adhering to each other, like large beads on a string. In the
eggs of both the young ones will be found, though at different stages of
maturity: those of the viper will crawl and bite in the moment the shell
that encloses them is broke open; those of the snake are not yet arrived
at their perfect form.</P>
<P>Father Labat took a serpent of the viper kind, that was nine
feet long, and ordered it to be opened in his presence. He then saw the
manner in which the eggs of these animals lie in the womb. In this creature
there were six eggs, each of the size of a goose egg, but longer, more
pointed, and covered with a membranous skin, by which also they were united
to each other. Each of these eggs con∣tained from thirteen to fifteen young
ones, <PB N="186" REF="192"/> about six inches long, and as thick as a
goose∣quill. Though the female from whence they were taken was spotted, the
young seemed to have a variety of colours very different from the parent; and
this led the traveller to suppose that the colour was no characteristic
mark among serpents. These little mischievous animals were no sooner
let loose from the shell, than they crept about, and put themselves into
a threatening posture, coiling themselves up and biting the stick with
which he was destroying them. In this manner he killed seventy-four young
ones; those that were contained in one of the eggs escaped at the place
where the female was killed, by the bursting of the egg and their getting
among the bushes.</P>
<P>The last distinction that I shall mention, but the most
material among serpents is, that some are venomous and some
inoffensive. If we consider the poison of serpents as it relates to
man, there is no doubt but that it is a scourge and an affliction. The
various calamities that the poison of serpents is capable of producing, are
not only inflicted by the animal itself, but by men more mischievous even
than serpents, who pre∣pare their venom to destroy each other. With this
the savages poison their arms, and also pre∣pare their revengeful
potions. The ancients were known to preserve it for the purposes of
suicide; <PB N="187" REF="193"/> and even among semi barbarous countries at
this day, the venom of snakes is used as a philtre.</P>
<P>But. though the poison be justly terrible to us, it has been
given to very good purposes for the animal's own proper support and
defence. Without this, serpents of all other animals would be the most
exposed and defenceless; without feet for escaping a pursuit; without
teeth capable of inflicting a dangerous wound, or without strength for
resistance; incapable, from their size, of finding security in very
small retreats like the earth-worm, and disgusting all from their
deformity, nothing was left for them but a speedy extirpation. But
furnished as they are with powerful poison, every rank of animals approach
them with dread, and never seize them but at an advantage. Nor is this all
the advantage they derive from it. The malignity of a few serves for the
protection of all. Though not above a tenth of their number are actually
venomous, yet the similitude they all bear to each other excites a general
terror of the whole tribe; and the uncertainty of their enemies in which the
poison chiefly resides, makes even the most harmless formidable. Thus
Providence seems to have acted with double precaution; it has given some of
them poison for the general defence of a tribe naturally feeble; but it has 
<PB N="188" REF="194"/> thinned the numbers of those which are venom∣ous,
lest they should become too powerful for the rest of animated nature.</P>
<P>From these noxious qualities in the serpent kind, it is no
wonder that not only man, but beasts and birds, carry on an unceasing war
against them. The ichneumon of the Indians, and the pecary of America,
destroy them in great numbers. These animals have the art of seizing them
near the head; and it is said that they can skin them with great
dexte∣rity. The vulture and the eagle also prey upon them in great abundance;
and often sousing down from the clouds, drop upon a long serpent, which
they snatch up struggling and writhing in the air. Dogs also are bred up
to oppose them. Father Feuillée tells us, that being in the woods of
Martinico, he was attacked by a large serpent, which he could not easily
avoid, when his dog immediately came to his relief, and seized the
assailant with great courage. The serpent entwined him, and pressed
him so violently, that the blood came out of his mouth, and yet the dog never
ceased till he had tore it to pieces. The dog was not sensible of his
wounds during the fight; but soon after his head swelled prodigiously,
and he lay on the ground as dead. But his master <PB N="189" REF="195"/>
having found hard by a banana tree, he applied its juice, mixed with treacle,
to the wounds, which recovered the dog, and quickly healed his sores.</P>
<P>But it is in man that these venomous crea∣tures find the
most dangerous enemy. The Psylli of old were famous for charming and
destroying serpents. Some moderns pretend to the same art. Cassaubon
says that he knew a man who could at any time summon an hundred serpents
together, and draw them into the fire. Upon a certain occasion, when one of
them bigger than the rest would not be brought in, he only repeated his
charm, and it came forward, like the rest, to submit to the flames.
Philo∣stratus describes particularly how the Indians charm serpents. 
<Q REND="inline">"They take a scarlet robe embroidered with
golden letters, and spread it before a serpent's hole. The golden letters
have a fascinating power; and by looking stedfastly, the serpent's eyes
are overcome and laid asleep."</Q> These and many other feats have been
often practised upon these animals by artful men, who had first prepared
the serpents for their exercise, and then exhi∣bited them as
adventitiously assembled at their call. In India there is nothing so
common as dancing serpents, which are carried about in a 
<PB N="190" REF="196"/> broad flat vessel somewhat resembling a sieve.
These erect and put themselves in motion at the word of command. When their
keeper sings a slow tune, they seem by their heads to keep time; when he
sings a quicker measure, they appear to move more brisk and lively. All
animals have a certain degree of docility; and we find that serpents
themselves can be brought to move and approach at the voice of their
master. From this trick successfully practised before the ignorant, it
is most probable has arisen all the boasted pretensions which some
have made to charming of serpents; an art to which the native Americans
pretend at this very day. One of Linnaeus's pupils we are told pur∣chased the
secret from an Indian, and then dis∣covered it to his master; but, like
all secrets of the kind, it is probable this ended in a few unmeaning words
of no efficacy.</P>
<P>Though the generality of mankind regard this formidable race
with horror, yet there have been some nations, and there are some at this
day, that consider them with veneration and regard. The adoration paid by the
ancient Egyptians to a serpent is well known: many of the nations at
present along the western coast of Africa retain the same unaccountable
veneration. Upon the gold and slave coasts, a stranger, 
<PB N="191" REF="197"/> upon entering the cottages of the natives, is often
surprized to see the roof swarming with serpents, that cling there
without molesting and unmolested by the natives. But his surprize will
encrease upon going farther southward to the kingdom of Widah, when he
finds that a serpent is the god of the country. This animal, which travellers
describe as a huge overgrown creature, has its habitation, its temple, and
its priests. These impress the vulgar with an opinion of its virtues; and
numbers are daily seen to offer not only their goods, their pro∣visions,
and their prayers, at the shrine of their hideous deity, but also their
wives and daughters. These the priests readily accept of, and after some
days of penance, return them to their sup∣pliants, much benefited by the
serpent's sup∣posed embraces. Such a complicated picture of ignorance and
imposture gives no very fa∣vourable impressions of our fellow creatures;
but we may say in defence of human nature, that the most frightful of
reptiles is worshipped by the most uncultivated and barbarous of
mankind.</P>
<P>From this general picture of the serpent tribe, one great
distinction obviously presents itself; namely, into those that are
venomous and those that are wholly destitute of poison. 
<PB N="192" REF="198"/> To the first belong the viper, the rattlesnake, the
cobra di capello, and all their affinities: to the other, the common black
snake, the lyboya, the boiguacu, the amphisbaena, and various others that,
though destitute of venom, do not cease to be formidable. I will therefore
give their history separately, beginning with the ve∣nomous class as they
have the strongest claims to our notice and attention.</P>

<DIV2 N="9" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="193" REF="199"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. IX. Of venomous Serpents in general.</HEAD>
<P>THE poison of serpents has been for ages one of the
greatest objects of human consideration. To us who seldom feel the
vengeful wound, it is merely a subject of curiosity; but to those placed
in the midst of the serpent tribe, who are every day exposed to some
new disaster, it becomes a matter of the most serious importance. To
remedy the bite of a serpent is considered among our physicians as one of
the slightest operations in medicine; but among the phy∣sicians of the
east, the antidotes for this cala∣mity make up the bulk of their
dispensaries. In our colder climates, the venom does not ap∣pear with that
instantaneous operation which it exhibits in the warmer regions; for either
its powers are less exquisite, or our fluids are not carried round in
such rapid circulation.</P>
<P>In all countries, however, the poison of the serpent is
sufficiently formidable to deserve notice, and to excite our attention to
its nature and effects. It will therefore in the first place be proper to
describe its seat in the animal, as also the instrument by which the
wound is made <PB N="194" REF="200"/> and the poison injected. In all this
venomous class of reptiles, whether the viper, the rattle∣snake, or the
cobra di capello, there are two large teeth or fangs that issue from the
upper jaw, and that hang out beyond the lower. The rest of the snake tribe
are destitute of these; and it is most probable that wherever these
fangs are wanting, the animal is harmless; on the con∣trary, wherever they
are found it is to be avoided as the most pestilent enemy. These are the
instruments that seem to place the true distinc∣tion between animals of
the serpent kind; the wounds which these fangs inflict produce the most
dangerous symptoms; the wounds inflicted by the teeth only are attended with
nothing more than the ordinary consequences attending the bite of any other
animal. Our first great at∣tention, therefore, upon seeing a serpent
should be directed to the teeth. If it has the fang teeth, it is to be placed
among the venomous, class; if it wants them, it may be set down as
inoffensive. I am not ignorant that many ser∣pents are said to be
dangerous whose jaws are unfurnished with fangs; but it is most probable
that our terrors only have furnished these ani∣mals with venom; for of all
the tribe whose teeth are thus formed, not one will be found to have a bag
for containing poison, nor a con∣duit <PB N="195" REF="201"/> for injecting it
into the wound. The Black Snake, the Liboya, the Blind Worm, and a hundred
others that might be mentioned, have their teeth of an equal size, fixed into
the jaws, and with no other apparatus for in∣flicting a dangerous wound than a
dog or a lizard; but it is otherwise with the venomous tribe we are now
describing; these are well furnished, not only with an elaboratory where
the poison is formed, but a canal by which it is conducted to the jaw, a bag
under the tooth for keeping it ready for every occasion, and also an
aperture in the tooth itself for injecting it into the wound. To be more
particular, the glands that serve to fabricate this venomous fluid are
situated on each side of the head behind the eyes, and have their canals
leading from thence to the bottom of the fangs in the upper jaw, where they
empty into a kind of bladder, from whence the fangs on each side are seen
to grow. The venom contained in this bladder is a yellowish thick
tasteless liquor, which injected into the blood is death, yet which may be
swal∣lowed without any danger.</P>
<P>The fangs that give the wound come next under observation;
they are large in proportion to the size of the animal that bears them;
crooked, yet sharp enough to inflict a ready <PB N="196" REF="202"/> wound.
They grow one on each side, and sometimes two, from two moveable bones in
the upper jaw, which by sliding backward or forward, have a power of erecting
or depressing the teeth at pleasure. In these bones are also fixed
many teeth, but no way venomous, and only serving to take and hold the
animal's prey. Besides this apt disposition of the fangs, they are hollow
within, and have an opening towards the point like the slit of a pen, through
which when the fang is pressed down upon the bladder where it grows, there
is seen to issue a part of the venom that lay below. To describe this
operation at once, when the serpent is irritated to give a venomous wound, it
opens its for∣midable jaws to the widest extent; the moveable bones of the
upper jaw slide forward; the fangs that lay before inclining are thus
erected; they are struck with force into the flesh of the ob∣noxious
person; by meeting resistance at the points, they press upon the
bladders of venom from whence they grow; the venom issues up through the
hollow of the tooth; and is pressed out through its slit into the wound,
which by this time the tooth has made in the skin. Thus from a slight
puncture, and the infusion of a drop of venom scarce larger than the head
of a pin, the part is quickly enflamed and, without <PB N="197" REF="203"/> a
proper antidote, the whole frame contami∣nated.</P>
<P>The appearances which this venom produces are different,
according to the serpent that wounds, or the season, or the strength of
the animal that strikes the blow. If a viper inflicts the wound, and the
remedy be neglected, the symptoms are not without danger. It first causes
an acute pain in the place affected, attended with a swelling, first red,
and afterwards livid. This by degrees spreads to the neighbouring parts;
great faintness and a quick, though low and interrupted, pulse ensues: to
this succeed great sickness at the stomach, billious and con∣vulsive
vomitings, cold sweats, pains about the navel, and death itself. But the
violence of these symptoms depend much on the season of the year, the
difference of the climate, the size or rage of the animal, and the depth and
situa∣tion of the wound. These symptoms are much more violent, and
succeed each other more ra∣pidly after the bite of a rattle-snake; but when
the person is bit by the cobra di capello, he dies in an hour, his whole
frame being dissolved into a putrid mass of corruption.</P>
<P>Nothing surely can more justly excite our wonder than that
so small a quantity of venom should produce such powerful and deadly
effects. <PB N="198" REF="204"/> If the venom itself be examined through a
mi∣croscope, it will be found to shoot into little chrystals that, to an
imagination already im∣pressed with its potency, look like so many darts
fit for entering the blood-vessels, and wounding their tender coats. But
all these darts are wholly of our own making; the softest mildest fluid
whatever, possessed of any consistency, will form chrystals under
the eye of the micro∣scope, and put on an appearance exactly like the venom
of the viper. In fact, this venom has no acrid taste whatever; and to all
experi∣ments that our senses can make upon it, appears a slimy insipid
fluid. Charas, who often tasted it, assures us of the fact; and
asserts, that it may be taken inwardly without any sensible effects or
any prejudice to the constitution. But the famous experiments that were tried
by Redi and others, in the presence of the Great Duke of Tuscany and his
court, put this beyond any doubt whatsoever. By these it appeared, that the
serpent having once bitten, exhausted for that time the greatest part of
its poison; and though the wound caused by its biting a second time was
attended with some malignant symp∣toms, yet they were much milder than
before. It appeared that the serpent biting upon a sponge, or a piece of
soft bread, and then biting <PB N="199" REF="205"/> a dog immediately after,
did not inflict a wound more dangerous than the prick of a needle. It appeared
that the venom being collected, and a needle dipped therein, this produced
almost as painful effects as the tooth of the animal itself. But what
caused the greatest surprize in the court was the seeming rashness
of one Tozzi, a viper-catcher; who, while the philosophers were giving
elaborate lectures on the danger of the poison when taken internally, boldly
desired a large quantity of it might be put together; and then, with the
utmost confidence, drank it off before them all. The court was struck with
astonishment, and expected that the man would instantly fall dead; but
they soon perceived their mistake, and found that taken in this manner the
poison was as harmless as water; so true is that famous passage of
Lucan, 
<Q> 
<L>Noxia serpentum est admixto sanguine pestis:</L> 
<L>Morsu virus habent, et fatum in dente minantur:</L> 
<L>Pocula morte carent.</L></Q></P>
<P>What then shall we say to the speedy effect of so
seemingly harmless a liquid taken into the circulation? Let us first
observe, that milk is one of the most mild and nourishing of all fluids,
and seemingly the most friendly to the human constitution; yet if milk be
injected into a vein, <PB N="200" REF="206"/> it will quickly become fatal, and
kill with more certain destruction than even the venom of the viper. From
hence then we may infer, that the introducing not only the serpentine venom,
but also a quantity of any other mixture, into the circulation, will be
fatal; and that, conse∣quently, serpents kill as well by their power of
injecting the wound as by the potency of their poison. Some indeed may inject
a more acri∣monious mixture, and this may produce more speedy effects; but
any mixture thus injected would be dangerous, and many would be fatal.</P>
<P>Ray gives us an instance of the potency of the serpent
poison; which, though it has all the air of a fable, I cannot help
transcribing. 
<Q REND="inline">"A gentleman who went over to the East-Indies,
while he was one day sitting among some friends, was accosted by an
Indian smuggler, who offered to shew him some ex∣periments respecting
the venom of serpents; an exhibition usual enough in that country. Having
first, therefore, produced a large ser∣pent, he assured the company
that it was harmless; and to convince them of what he said, he tied up his
arm, as is usual with those who are going to be bled, and whipped the
serpent till it was provoked to bite him. Having drawn in this manner about
half a <PB N="201" REF="207"/> spoonful of blood from his arm, he put the
congealed clot upon his thigh. He then took out a much smaller serpent,
which was no other than the cobra di capello; and having tied up its neck, he
procured about half a drop of its venom, which he sprinkled on the clot of
blood on his thigh, which instantly began to serment and bubble, and soon
changed colour from a red into yellow."</Q></P>
<P>This he pretended was caused by the extreme malignity of that
animal's venom; however, I have no doubt that the whole is either a fable, or a
trick of the Indian; who, while he seemed to mix the serpent's venom,
actually infused some stronger ingredient, some mineral acid, into the
mass of blood, which was capable of working such a change. It cannot be
supposed that any animal poison could act so powerfully upon the blood
already drawn and coagulated; for a poison that could operate thus
instan∣taneously upon cold blood, could not fail of soon destroying the
animal itself.</P>
<P>Be this as it will, the effects of serpent poison are but
too well known, though the manner of operation be not so clear. As none of
this malignant tribe grow to a great size, the longest of them not
exceeding nine feet, they seldom seek the combat with larger animals, or
offend <PB N="202" REF="208"/> others till they are first offended. Did they
exert their malignity in proportion to their power, they could easily drive
the ranks of nature before them; but they seem unconscious of their own
superiority, and rather fly than offer to meet the meanest opposer. Their
food chiefly consists of small prey, such as birds, moles, toads and
lizards; so that they never attack the more formidable animals that would
seldom die unrevenged. They lurk therefore in the clefts of rocks, or among
stony places; they twine round the branches of trees, or sun themselves
in the long grass at the bottom. There they only seek repose and
safety. If some unwary traveller invades their retreats, their first
effort is to sly; but when either pur∣sued or accidentally trod upon, they
then make a fierce and fatal resistance. For this purpose, they raise
themselves according to their strength upon their tail, erect the head,
seize the limb that presses them, the wound is given and the head
withdrawn in a moment. It is not therefore without reason, that the
Asiatics, who live in regions where serpents greatly abound, wear boots and
long cloaths, which very well protect their lower parts from the accidental
resentment of their reptile annoyers.</P>
<P>In the eastern and western Indies, the number 
<PB N="203" REF="209"/> of noxious serpents is various; in this country we are
acquainted only with one. The viper is the only animal in Great Britain from
whose bite we have any thing to fear. In the tropical climates, the
rattle-snake, the whip-snake, and the cobra di capello, are the most
formidable, though by no means the most common. From the general notoriety of
these particular serpents, and the universal terror which they
occasion, it would seem that few others are possessed of such
powerful malignity.</P>
<P>Vipers are found in many parts of this island; but the dry,
stony, and in particular the chalky, countries abound with them. This animal
seldom grows to a greater length than two feet; though sometimes they are
found above three. The ground colour of their bodies is a dirty yellow; that of
the female is deeper. The back is marked the whole length with a series of
rhomboid black spots, touching each other at the points; the sides with
triangular ones, the belly entirely black. It is chiefly distinguished from
the common black snake by the colour, which in the latter is more
beauti∣fully mottled, as well as by the head, which is thicker than the body;
but particularly by the tail, which in the viper, though it ends in a point,
does not run tapering to so great a length <PB N="204" REF="210"/> as in the
other. When, therefore, other di∣stinctions fail, the difference of the tail
can be discerned at a single glance.</P>
<P>The viper differs from most other serpents in being much
slower, as also in excluding its young compleatly formed, and bringing them
forth alive. The kindness of Providence seems exerted not only in
diminishing the speed, but also the fertility, of this dangerous
creature. They copulate in May, and are supposed to be about three months
before they bring forth, and have seldom above eleven eggs at a time. These
are of the size of a blackbird's eggs, and chained together in the womb like
a string of beads. Each egg contains from one to four young ones; so that
the whole of a brood may amount to about twenty or thirty. They con∣tinue in
the womb till they come to such per∣fection as to be able to burst from the
shell; and they are said by their own efforts to creep from their
confinement into the open air, where they continue for several days without
taking any food whatsoever. 
<Q REND="inline">"We have been often assured," says Mr.
Penant, "by intelligent people, of the truth of a fact, that the young of the
viper when terrified will run down the throat of the parent, and seek
shelter in its belly in the same manner as the young of the 
<PB N="205" REF="211"/> oppossum retire into the ventral pouch of the old
one. From this," continues he, "some have imagined that the viper is so
unnatural as to devour its own young; but this deserves no credit, as these
animals live upon frogs, toads, lizards, and young birds, which they swallow
whole, though the morsel is often three times as thick as their own
body."</Q></P>
<P>The viper is capable of supporting very long abstinence, it
being known that some have been kept in a box six months without food; yet
du∣ring the whole time they did not abate of their vivacity. They feed only a
small part of the year, but never during their confinement; for if mice,
their favourite diet, should at that time be thrown into their box, though
they will kill, yet they will never eat, them. When at liberty, they re∣main
torpid throughout the winter; yet, when confined, have never been observed to
take their annual repose. Their poison, however, decreases in proportion
to the length of their confinement; and it is thought, that the virtues of the
animal's flesh are, by the same restraints, considerably
lessened.</P>
<P>They are usually taken with wooden tongs, by the end of the
tail, which may be done without danger; for, while held in that position,
they are unable to wind themselve up to hurt <PB N="206" REF="212"/> their
enemy: yet, notwithstanding this pre∣caution, the viper-catchers are
frequently bit by them; but, by the application of sallad-oil, the bite is
effectually cured.</P>
<P>One William Oliver, a viper-catcher at Bath, was the first who
discovered this admirable re∣medy. On the first of June, 1735, in the
pre∣sence of a great number of persons, he suffered himself to be bit
by an old black viper, brought by one of the company, upon the wrist, and
joint of the thumb of the right hand, so that drops of blood came out of the
wounds: he im∣mediately felt a violent pain both at the top of his thumb, and
up his arm, even before the viper was loosened from his hand; soon after he
felt a pain, resembling that of burning, trickle up his arm; in a few minutes
his eyes began to look red and fiery, and to water much; in less than an hour
he perceived the venom seize his heart, with a pricking pain, which was
attended with faintness, shortness of breath, and cold sweats; in a few
minutes after this, his belly began to swell, with great gripings, and pains
in his back, which were attended with vomitings and purgings: during the
violence of these symp∣toms, his sight was gone for several minutes,
but he could hear all the while. He said, that in his former experiments, he
had never de∣ferred <PB N="207" REF="213"/> making use of his remedy longer
than he perceived the effects of the venom reaching his heart; but this time,
being willing to satisfy the company thoroughly, and trusting to the
speedy effects of his remedy, which was nothing more than olive-oil, he
forbore to apply any thing, till he found himself exceeding ill and quite
giddy. About an hour and a quarter after the first of his being bit, a
chaffing-dish of glowing charcoal was brought in, and his naked arm was held
over it, as near as he could bear, while his wife rubbed in the oil with her
hand, turning his arm continually round, as if she would have roasted it
over the coals: he said the poison soon abated, but the swelling did
not diminish much. Most violent purgings and vomitings soon ensued; and
his pulse became so low, and so often interrupted, that it was thought
proper to order him a repetition of cordial potions: he said he was not
sensible of any great relief from these; but that a glass or two of
olive-oil drank down, seemed to give him ease. Continuing in this dangerous
con∣dition, he was put to bed, where his arm was again bathed over a pan of
charcoal, and rub∣bed with sallad-oil, heated in a ladle over the charcoal,
by Dr. Mortimer's direction, who was the physician that drew up the account.
From <PB N="208" REF="214"/> this last operation he declared that he found
immediate ease, as though by some charm: he soon after fell into a
profound sleep, and, after about nine hours sound rest, awaked about
six the next morning, and found himself very well; but in the afternoon, on
drinking some rum and strong beer, so as to be almost intoxicated, the
swelling returned, with much pain and cold sweats, which abated soon, on
bathing the arm, as before, and wrapping it up in a brown pa∣per, soaked in
the oil.</P>
<P>Such are the effects of the viper's bite; yet its flesh has
long been celebrated as a noble me∣dicine. A broth, made by boiling one viper
in a quart of water till it comes to a pint, is the usual method in which it
is given at present; and it is said to be a very powerful restorative in
battered constitutions: the salt of vipers is also thought to exceed any
other animal salt whatever, in giving vigour to the languid cir∣culation, and
prompting to venery.</P>
<P>The Rattle-snake is bred in America, and in no part of the old
world. Some are as thick as a man's leg, and six feet in length; but the
most usual size is from four to five feet long. In most particulars it
resembles the viper: like that animal, having a large head and a small
neck, being of a dusky colour, and furnished <PB REF="215"/>

</FIGURE> <PB N="209" REF="216"/> with fangs that inflict the
most terrible wounds. It differs, however, in having a large scale, which
hangs like a penthouse over each eye. The eye also is furnished with a
nictitating membrane, that preserves it from dust; and its scales are of
a considerable degree of hardness. They are of an orange, tawny, and
blackish co∣lour on the back; and of an ash-colour on the belly, inclining
to lead. The male may be readily distinguished from the female, by a black
velvet spot on the head, and by the head being smaller and longer. But that
which, be∣sides their superior malignity, distinguishes them from all
other animals, is their rattle, an instru∣ment lodged in their tail, by which
they make such a loud, rattling noise, when they move, that their approach
may readily be perceived, and the danger avoided. This rattle, which is placed
in the tail, somewhat resembles, when taken out of the body, the curb chain
of a bri∣dle: it is composed of several thin, hard, hollow bones, linked to
each other, and rattling upon the slightest motion. It is supposed by
some, that the snake acquires an additional bone every year; and that, from
hence, its age may be pre∣cisely known: however this may be, certain it is,
that the young snakes, of a year or two old, have no rattles at all; while
many old ones have <PB N="210" REF="217"/> been killed, that had from eleven to
thirteen joints each. They shake and make a noise with these rattles with
prodigious quickness when they are disturbed; however, the peccary and the
vulture are no way terrified at the sound, but hasten, at the signal, to
seize the snake, as their most favourite prey.</P>
<P>It is very different with almost every other animal. The
certain death which ensues from this terrible creature's bite, makes a
solitude wherever it is heard. It moves along with the most majestic
rapidity; neither seeking to offend the larger animals, nor fearing their
insults. If unprovoked, it never meddles with any thing but its natural prey;
but when accidentally trod upon, or pursued to be destroyed, it then makes
a dreadful and desperate defence. It erects it∣self upon its tail, throws
back the head, and in∣flicts its wound in a moment; then parts, and inflicts a
second wound: after which, we are told, by some, that it remains torpid and
inactive, without even attempting to escape.</P>
<P>The very instant the wound is inflicted, though small in
itself, it appears more painful than the sting of a bee. This pain, which
is so suddenly felt, far from abating, grows every moment more excruciating
and dangerous: the limb wells; the venom reaches the head, which 
<PB N="211" REF="218"/> is soon of a monstrous size; the eyes are red and
fiery; the heart beats quick, with frequent interruptions: the pain becomes
insupportable, and some expire under it in five or six hours; but others,
who are of stronger constitutions, survive the agony for a few hours
longer, only to sink under a general mortification, which ensues, and
corrupts the whole body.</P>
<P>As a gentleman in Virginia was walking in the fields for his
amusement, he accidentally trod upon a rattle snake, that had been lurking
in a stony place; which, enraged by the pressure, reared up, bit his
hand, and shook its rattles. The gentleman readily perceived that he was in
the most dreadful danger; but unwilling to die unrevenged, he killed the
snake, and carrying it home in his hand, threw it on the ground before his
family, crying out, I am killed, and there is my murderer! In such an
extremity, the speediest remedies were the best. His arm, which was
beginning to swell, was tied up near the shoulder, the wound was anointed
with oil, and every precaution taken to stop the infection. By the help of a
very strong constitution he re∣covered; but not without feeling the most
va∣rious and dreadful symptoms for several weeks together. His arm, below
the ligature, ap∣peared of several colours, with a writhing among 
<PB N="212" REF="219"/> the muscles, that, to his terrified imagination,
appeared like the motions of the animal that had wounded him. A fever ensued;
the loss of his hair, giddiness, drought, weakness, and nervous
faintings: till, by slow degrees, a very strong habit overpowered the
latent malignity of the poison.</P>
<P>Several remedies have been tried to alleviate this calamity. A
decoction of the Virginian snake-root is considered as the most
effectual; and at the same time the head of the animal bruised and laid
upon the part affected, is thought to assist the cure. In general,
however, it is found to be fatal; and the Indians, sensible of this, take
care to dip their arrows in the poison under the rattle snake's fangs, when
they desire to take a signal revenge of their enemies.</P>
<P>Thus much concerning this animal is agreed upon by every
naturalist: there are other cir∣cumstances in its history, which are not
so well ascertained. And first, its motion, which some describe as
the swiftest imaginable; asserting, that its Indian name of Ecacoalt,
which signifies the wind-serpent, implies its agility: others, on the
contrary, assert, that it is the slowest and the most sluggish of
all serpents; and that it seldom moves from one place. In this
oppo∣sition <PB N="213" REF="220"/> of opinions, there are others, who
assert, that on even ground it moves but slowly; but then, among rocks,
that it goes at a great rate. If we may argue from analogy, the opinion of
those who contend for its slow motion, seems the most probable; as the
viper, which it so very much resembles, is remarkable among serpents for
its inactivity.</P>
<P>It is said also by some, that the rattle-snake has a
power of charming its prey into its mouth; and this is as strongly
contradicted by others. The inhabitants of Pensylvania are said to have
opportunities of observing this strange fascination every day. The
snake is often seen basking at the foot of a tree, where birds and
squirrels make their residence. There, coiled upon its tail, its jaws
extended, and its eyes shining like fire, the rattle-snake levels its
dreadful glare upon one of the little animals above. The bird or the
squirrel, which ever it may be, too plainly perceives the mischief
me∣ditating against it, and hops from branch to branch, with a timorous,
plaintive sound, wish∣ing to avoid, yet incapable of breaking through the
fascination: thus it continues for some time its feeble efforts and
complaints, but is still seen approaching lower and lower towards the
bot∣tom branches of the tree, until, at last, as if <PB N="214" REF="221"/>
overcome by the potency of its fears, it jumps down from the tree directly into
the throat of its frightful destroyer.</P>
<P>In order to ascertain the truth of this story, a mouse was
put into a large iron cage, where a rattle snake was kept, and the effects
carefully observed. The mouse remained motionless at one end of the cage;
while the snake, at the other, continued fixed, with its eye glaring full on
the little animal, and its jaws opened to their widest extent: the mouse
for some time seemed eager to escape; but every effort only served to
encrease its terrors, and to draw it still nearer the enemy; till, after
several ineffectual attempts to break the fascination, it was seen to run
into the jaws of the rattle-snake, where it was in∣stantly killed.</P>
<P>To these accounts the incredulous oppose the improbability
of the fact; they assert, that such a power ascribed to serpents, is
only the rem∣nant of a vulgar error, by which it was supposed that
serpents could be charmed, and had also a power of charming. They aver,
that animals are so far from running down the throat of a rattle snake in
captivity, that the snake will eat nothing in that state, but actually dies
for want of subsistence.</P>
<P>A serpent, called the Whip-snake, is still 
<PB N="215" REF="222"/> more venomous than the former. This animal, which is a
native of the east, is about five feet long, yet not much thicker than the
thong of a coachman's whip. It is exceedingly venomous; and its bite is said
to kill in about six hours. One of the Jesuit missionaries, happening
to enter into an Indian pagoda, saw what he took to be a whip-cord lying on
the floor, and stooped to take it up; but, upon handling it, what was his
surprize to find that it was ani∣mated, and no other than the whip-snake,
of which he had heard such formidable accounts: fortune, however, seemed
favourable to him, for he grasped it by the head, so that it had no power
to bite him, and only twisted its folds up his arm. In this manner he held
it, till it was killed by those who came to his assistance.</P>
<P>To this formidable class might be added the Asp, whose
bite however is not attended with those drowsy symptoms which the
ancients ascribed to it. The Jaculus of Jamaica also, is one of the
swiftest of the serpent kind. The Hoemorrhois, so called from the
hoemorrhages which its bite is said to produce; the Seps, whose wound is
very venomous, and causes the part affected to corrupt in a very short
time; the Coral Serpent, which is red, and whose bite is said to be fatal.
But of all others, the Cobra <PB N="216" REF="223"/> di Capello, or Hooded
Serpent, inflicts the most deadly and incurable wounds. Of this formidable
creature there are five or six different kinds; but they are all equally
dangerous, and their bite followed by speedy and certain death. It is from
three to eight feet long, with two large fangs hanging out of the upper jaw. It
has a broad neck, and a mark of dark brown on the forehead; which, when viewed
frontwise, looks like a pair of spectacles; but behind, like the head of a
cat. The eyes are fierce, and full of fire; the head is small, and the nose
flat, though covered with very large scales, of a yel∣lowish ash-colour;
the skin is white, and the large tumour on the neck is flat, and covered with
oblong, smooth scales. The bite of this animal is said to be incurable,
the patient dying in about an hour after the wound; the whole frame being
dissolved into one putrid mass of corruption.</P>
<P>To remedy the bite of all these animals, per∣haps sallad-oil
would be very efficacious: how∣ever the Indians make use of a composition,
which is called, in Europe, Petro de Cobra, or the Serpent Stone; and which,
applied to the wound, is said to draw out the venom. The composition of
this stone, for it is an artificial substance, is kept a secret; and
perhaps its <PB N="217" REF="224"/> effects in extracting the venom may be
ima∣ginary: nevertheless, it is certain that it has a power of sticking to
the skin, and sucking a part of the blood from the wound. This it may do
somewhat in the same manner as we see a tobacco-pipe stick to the lips
of a man who is smoking: yet still we are ignorant of the man∣ner; and the
secret might probably be of some use in medicine. It were to be wished,
there∣fore, that those who go into India would examine into this
composition, and give us the result of their enquiries: but I fear that it
is not to be∣nefit mankind, that our travellers now go to India.</P>

<PB N="218" REF="225"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. X. Of Serpents without Venom.</HEAD>
<P>THE class of serpents without poison, may be
distinguished from those that are venomous, by their wanting the fang
teeth: their heads also are not so thick in proportion to their bodies;
and, in general, they taper off to the tail more gradually in a point. But
notwithstanding their being destitute of venom, they do not cease to be
formidable: some grow to a size by which they become the most powerful
animals of the forest; and even the smallest and most harmless of
this slender tribe, find protection from the similitude of their form.</P>
<P>The fangs make the great distinction among serpents; and all
this tribe are without them. Their teeth are short, numerous, and, in the
smaller kinds, perfectly inoffensive: they lie in either jaw, as in frogs
and fishes, their points bending backwards, the better to secure their
prey. They want that artificial mechanism by which the poisonous tribe
inflict such deadly wounds: they have no gland in the head for preparing
venom; no conduits for conveying it to the teeth; no receptables there; no
hollow <PB N="219" REF="226"/> in the instrument that inflicts the wound.
Their bite, when the teeth happen to be large enough to penetrate the skin,
for in general they are too small for this purpose, is attended with no
other symptoms than those of an ordinary puncture; and many of this tribe,
as if sensible of their own impotence, cannot be provoked to bite, though
never so rudely assaulted. They hiss, dart out their forky tongues,
erect them∣selves on the tail, and call up all their terrors to intimidate
their aggressors; but seem to con∣sider their teeth as unnecessary
instruments of defence, and never attempt to use them. Even among the
largest of this kind, the teeth are never employed, in the most desperate
engage∣ments. When a hare or a bird is caught, the teeth may serve to prevent
such small game from escaping; but when a buffalo or a tiger is to be
encountered, it is by the strong folds of the body, by the fierce
verberations of the tail, that the enemy is destroyed: by this twining round,
and drawing the knot with convulsive energy, this enormous reptile breaks
every bone in the quadrupede's body, and then, at one mor∣sel, devours its
prey.</P>
<P>From hence we may distinguish the unve∣nomous tribe into two
kinds: first, into those which are seldom found of any considerable 
<PB N="220" REF="227"/> magnitude, and that never offend animals larger or more
powerful than themselves, but which find their chief protection in flight, or
in the doubtfulness of their form; secondly, into such as grow to an
enormous size, fear no enemy, but indiscriminately attack all other animals
and devour them. Of the first kind is the Common Black Snake, the Blind Worm,
the Esculapian Serpent, the Amphisbaena, and several others. Of the
second, the Lyboya, the Boiguacu, the Depona, and the Boiquatrara.</P>
<P>The Black Snake is the largest of English ser∣pents,
sometimes exceeding four feet in length. The neck is slender; the middle of
the body thick; the back and sides covered with small scales; the belly
with oblong, narrow, transverse plates: the colour of the back and sides
are of a dusky brown; the middle of the back marked with two rows of small
black spots, running from the head to the tail; the plates on the belly are
dusky; the scales on the sides are of a bluish white: the teeth are
small and serrated, lying on each side of the jaw in two rows. The whole
species is perfectly inoffensive; taking shelter in dung hills, and among
bushes in moist places; from whence they seldom remove, un∣less in the
midst of the day, in summer, when they are called out by the heat to bask
themselves <PB N="221" REF="228"/> in the sun. If disturbed or attacked,
they move away among the brambles with great swiftness; but if too
closely pursued, they hiss and threaten, and thus render themselves
formidable, though incapable of offending.</P>
<P>The black snake preys upon frogs, insects, worms, mice, and
young birds; and, considering the smallness of the neck, it is amazing
how large an animal it will swallow. The black snake of Virginia, which is
larger than our's, and generally grows to six feet long, takes a prey
proportionable to its size; partridges, chickens, and young ducks. It is
generally found in the neighbourhood of the hen roost, and will devour the
eggs even while the hen is sitting upon them: these it swallows whole;
and often, after it has done the mischief, will coil itself round in the
nest.</P>
<P>The whole of this tribe are oviparous, ex∣cluding eighty or an
hundred eggs at a time, which are laid in dung-hills or hot-beds; the heat of
which, aided by that of the sun, brings them to maturity. During winter they
lie tor∣pid, in banks of hedges, and under old trees.</P>
<P>The Blind Worm is another harmless reptile, with a formidable
appearance. The usual length of this species is eleven inches. The eyes are
red; the head small; the neck still more slender: <PB N="222" REF="229"/>
from that part the body grows suddenly, and continues of an equal bulk to the
tail, which ends quite blunt: the colour of the back is ci∣nereous, marked with
very small lines, composed of minute black specks; the sides are of a
red∣dish cast; the belly dusky, and marked like the back. The motion of
this serpent is slow; from which, and from the smallness of the eyes,
are derived its names; some calling it the Slow, and some the Blind Worm.
Like all the rest of the kind in our climates, they lie torpid during winter;
and are sometimes found, in vast num∣bers, twisted together. This animal,
like the former, is perfectly innocent; however, like the viper, it brings
forth its young alive. Gesner tells us, that one of these being struck on
the head when it was pregnant, it immediately cast forth its young.</P>
<P>The Amphisbaena, or the Double Headed Serpent, is remarkable
for moving along with either the head or the tail foremost; and from thence
it has been thought to have two heads. This error took its rise from the
thickness of the tail, which, at a distance, may be mistaken for another
head. Upon a nearer view, however, the error is easily discovered, and the
animal will be found formed according to the usual course of nature. It is
as thick at one end as <PB N="223" REF="230"/> at the other; and the colour of
the skin is like that of the earth, being rough, hard, and va∣riously
spotted. Some have affirmed that its bite is dangerous; but this must be a
mistake, as it wants the fangs, and consequently the ela∣boratory that
prepares the poison.</P>
<P>These animals are only formidable from their similitude to
the viper tribe; and, in some coun∣tries, where such reptiles are common,
they make the distinction so exactly, that while they destroy serpents
of one kind with great ani∣mosity, they take others into their houses, and
even into their bosoms, with a kind of unac∣countable affection. The
Esculapian Serpent of Italy is among this number. It is there suf∣fered to
crawl about the chambers; and often gets into the beds where people lie. It is
a yel∣low serpent, of about an ell long; and though innocent, yet will bite
when exasperated. They are said to be great destroyers of mice; and this
may be the reason why they are taken under human protection. The Boyuna of
Ceylon is equally a favourite among the natives; and they consider the
meeting it as a sign of good luck. The Surinam Serpent, which some
improperly call the Ammodytes, is equally harmless and desirable among the
savages of that part of the world. They consider themselves as extremely 
<PB N="224" REF="231"/> happy if this animal comes into their huts. The colours
of this serpent are so many and beautiful, that they surpass all
description; and these per∣haps are the chief inducements to the savages
to consider its visits as so very fortunate. A still greater favourite
is the Prince of Serpents, a native of Japan, that has not its equal for
beauty. The scales which cover the back are reddish, finely shaded, and
marbled with large spots of irregular figures mixed with black. The fore part
of the head is covered with large beautiful scales, the jaws bordered with
yellow, the fore∣head marked with a black marbled streak, and the eyes
handsome and lively. But of all others, the Gerenda of the East Indies is
the most ho∣noured and esteemed. To this animal, which is finely spotted
with various colours, the natives of Calicut pay divine honours; and while
their deity lies coiled up, which is its usual posture, the people fall
upon their faces before it with stupid adoration. The African Gerenda is
larger, and worshiped in the same manner, by the inhabitants of the
coasts of Mozambique. The skin is not so finely spotted as the former;
but it is variegated all over the body with very fine white, ash coloured,
and black spots. The brilliancy of colouring in these reptiles would only
serve with us to encrease our disgust; but <PB N="225" REF="232"/> in
those countries where they are, common distinctions are made; and even in
this horrid class, there are some eyes that can discover beauty.</P>
<P>But in the larger tribe of serpents, there is nothing but
danger to be apprehended. This formidable class, though without venom, have
something frightful in their colour, as well as their size and form. They
want that vivid hue with which the savages are so much pleased in the
lesser kinds; they are all found of a dusky colour, with large teeth,
which are more for∣midable than dangerous.</P>
<P>The first of this class, is the Great Jiboya of Java and
Brasil, which Leguat affirms, he has seen fifty feet long. Nor is he
singular in this report, as many of the missionaries affirm the same;
and we have the concurrent testimony of historians as a further proof. The
largest ani∣mal of this kind, which has been brought into Europe, is but
thirty-six feet long; and it is probable, that much greater have been seen
and destroyed, before they were thought worth sending so far, to
satisfy European curiosity. The most usual length, however, of the
jiboya, is about twenty feet, and the thickness in pro∣portion. The teeth are
small in proportion to <PB N="226" REF="233"/> the body; nor are they used,
but when it seizes the smallest prey. It lies in wait for wild ani∣mals
near the paths, and when it throws itself upon them, it wraps them round so
closely as to break all the bones; then moistening the whole body over with
its slaver, it makes it fit for deglutition, and swallows it whole.</P>
<P>The Boiguacu is supposed to be the next in magnitude, and
has often been seen to swallow a goat whole. It is thickest in the middle
of the body, and grows shorter and smaller towards the head and the tail:
on the middle of the back, there is a chain of small black spots running
along the length of it; and on each side, there are large round black
spots, at some distance from each other, which are white in the center:
between these, near the belly, there are two rows of lesser black
spots, which run parallel to the back. It has a double row of sharp teeth
in each jaw, of a white colour, and shining like mother-of pearl. The head is
broad; and over the eyes it is raised into two prominences: near the
extremity of the tail there are two claws, resembling those of birds.</P>
<P>These serpents lie hid in thickets, from whence they sally
out unawares, and raising themselves upright on their tails, will attack
both men and <PB N="227" REF="234"/> beasts. They make a loud hissing
noise when exasperated; and sometimes winding up trees, will dart down
upon travellers, and twist them∣selves so closely round their bodies,
as to dispatch them in a very few minutes. Condamine, how∣ever, affirms, that
their bite is not dangerous; for though the teeth are so large, as to
inspire the beholder with terror, yet the wound they make is attended with no
dangerous conse∣quences whatever. Dellon affirms, that they generally haunt
desart places; and though they are sometimes seen near great towns, or on
the banks of rivers, yet it is generally after some great inundation: he
never saw any but what were dead; and they appeared to him, like the trunk of
a great tree lying on the ground.</P>
<P>To this class of large serpents, we may refer the Depona, a
native of Mexico, with a very large head and great jaws. The mouth is armed
with cutting, crooked teeth, among which there are two longer than the rest,
placed in the fore part of the upper jaw, but very different from the fangs of
the viper. All round the mouth there is a broad scaly border; and the eyes
are so large, that they give it a very terrible aspect. The forehead is
covered with very large scales; <PB N="228" REF="235"/> on which are placed
others, that are smaller, curiously ranged: those on the back are
greyish, and along it runs a double chain, whose ends are joined in the
manner of a buckler. Each side of the belly is marbled with large square
spots, of a chesnut colour; in the middle of which is a spot, which is
round and yellow. They avoid the sight of man; and consequently, never do
much harm.</P>
<P>Such are the most noted animals of the ser∣pent tribe: but
to recount all, would be a vain, as well as a useless endeavour. In those
coun∣tries where they abound, their discriminations are so numerous, and
their colours so various, that every thicket seems to produce a new
ani∣mal. The same serpent is often found to bring forth animals of eight or
ten different colours: and the naturalist who attempts to arrange them by
that mark, will find that he has made di∣stinctions which are entirely
disowned by Nature: however, a very considerable number might be added to
enlarge the catalogue; but having supplied a general history, the mind
turns away from a subject where every object presents something
formidable or loathsome to the imagination. Indeed, the whole tribe
resemble each other so nearly, that the history of one 
<PB N="229" REF="236"/> may almost serve for every other. They are all
terrible to the imagination, all frightful to behold in their fury, and have
long been con∣sidered as a race of animals between whom and man there is a
natural antipathy.</P>

<HEAD>AN HISTORY OF INSECTS.</HEAD>
<HEAD>Of Insects in general.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING gone through the upper ranks of nature, we descend to
that of insects, a subject almost inexhaustible from the number of its
tribes and the variety of their appearance. Those who have professedly
written on this subject seem to consider it as one of the greatest that
can occupy the human mind, as the most pleasing in animated nature. 
<Q REND="inline">"After an attentive examination," says
Swammerdam, "of the nature and anatomy of the smallest as well as the
largest animals, I cannot help al∣lowing the least an equal, or perhaps a
su∣perior, degree of dignity. If, while we dissect with care the larger
animals, we are filled <PB N="234" REF="239"/> with wonder at the elegant
disposition of their parts, to what an height is our astonish∣ment
raised, when we discover all these parts arranged in the least in the
same regular manner! Notwithstanding the smallness of ants, nothing
hinders our preferring them to the largest animals. If we consider either
their unwearied diligence, their wonderful strength, or their inimitable
propensity to labour. Their amazing love to their young is still more
unparalleled among the larger classes. They not only daily carry them to
such places as may afford them food; but if by accident they are killed, and
even cut into pieces, they, with the utmost tenderness, will carry them
away piecemeal in their arms. Who can shew such an example among the larger
animals, which are dignified with the title of perfect? Who can find an
instance in any other creature that can come in compe∣tition with
this?"</Q></P>
<P>Such is the language of a man who by long study became
enamoured of his subject; but to those who judge less partially, it will
be found that the insect tribe, for every reason, deserve but the last
and lowest rank in animated nature. As in mechanics the most complicated
machines are required to perform the nicest operations, so in 
<PB N="235" REF="240"/> anatomy the noblest animals are most variously and
wonderfully made. Of all living beings, man offers the most wonderful variety
in his internal conformation; quadrupedes come next; and other animals follow
in proportion to their powers or their excellencies. Insects seem of all
others the most imperfectly formed: from their minuteness, the
dissecting knife can go but a short way in the investigation; but one
thing argues an evident imperfection, which is, that many of them can live a
long time, though deprived of those organs which are necessary to life in
the higher ranks of nature. Many of them are furnished with lungs and an
heart like nobler animals; yet the caterpillar con∣tinues to live, though its
heart and lungs, which is often the case, are entirely eaten away.</P>
<P>But it is not from their conformation alone that insects are
inferior to other animals, but from their instincts also. It is true, that
the ant and the bee present us with very striking instances of
assiduity; but how far are theirs beneath the marks of sagacity exhibited
in the hound or the stag! A bee taken from the swarm is totally helpless
and inactive, inca∣pable of giving the smallest variation to its
in∣stincts: it has but one single method of ope∣rating, and, if put from
that, it can turn to <PB N="236" REF="241"/> no other. In the pursuits of the
hound, there is something like a choice; in the labours of the bee, the whole
appears like necessity or compulsion.</P>
<P>If insects be considered as bearing a relation to man, and
as assisting him in the pleasures or necessities of life, they
will, even in this respect, sink in the comparison with the larger tribes
of nature. It is true, that the bee, the silk-worm, the cochineal fly, and
the cantharides, render him signal services; but how many others of this
class, are either noxious, or totally unserviceable to him. Even in a
country like ours, where all the noxious animals have been reduced by repeated
assiduity, the insect tribes still maintain their ground, and are but
too often unwelcome intruders upon the fruits of human industry. But in more
uncultivated re∣gions, their annoyance and devastations are ter∣rible. What
an uncomfortable life must the natives lead in Lapland, and some parts of
America, where, if a candle be lighted, the in∣sects swarm in such
abundance, as instantly to extinguish it with their numbers; where the
in∣habitants are obliged to smear their bodies and faces with tar, or some
other composition, to protect them from-the puncture of their minute enemies;
where, though millions are destroyed, <PB N="237" REF="242"/> famished
millions are still seen to succeed, and to make the torture
endless!</P>
<P>Their amazing number is also an argument of their
imperfection. It is a rule that obtains through all nature, that the nobler
animals are slowly produced, and that nature acts with a kind of dignified
economy; but the meaner births are lavished in profusion, and thousands
are brought forth merely to supply the neces∣sities of the more favourite
objects of creation. Of all other productions in nature, insects are the
most numerous. Vegetables that cover the surface of the earth bear no
proportion to their multitudes; and though at first sight herbs of the
field seem to be the parts of organized na∣ture produced in the greatest
abundance, yet, upon minuter inspection, we shall find every plant
supporting a number of scarce perceptible creatures, that fill up the
various stages of youth, vigour, and age, in the compass of a few days
existence.</P>
<P>All other animals are capable of some degree of education;
their instincts may be suppressed or altered; the dog may be taught to
fetch and carry; the bird to whistle a tune; and the serpent to dance: but
the insect has but one in∣variable method of operating; no arts can turn it
from its instincts; and indeed its life is too <PB N="238" REF="243"/> short
for instruction, as a single season often terminates its
existence.</P>
<P>For these reasons, the insect tribe are de∣servedly
placed in the lowest rank of animated nature; and, in general, they seem
more allied to the vegetables on which they feed than to the nobler classes
above them. Many of them are attached to one vegetable, often to a single
leaf; there they encrease with the flourishing plant, and die as it decays;
a few days fill up the measure of their contemptible lives; while the ends
for which they were produced, or the pleasures they enjoyed, to us at
least, are utterly unknown.</P>
<P>Yet while I am thus fixing the rank of a certain class of
animals, it seems necessary to define the nature of those animals which
are thus degraded. Definitions in general produce little knowledge; but here
where the shades of nature are so intimately blended, some
discri∣mination is necessary to prevent confusion. The smallness of
the animal, for instance, does not constitute an insect; for then, many
of the lizard kind, which are not above two inches long, would come under this
denomination; and if the smaller lizards, why not the crocodile, which would
be a terrible insect indeed? In the same manner, smallness, with a
slow creeping <PB N="239" REF="244"/> motion, does not constitute an
insect; for, though snails might be called insects with the same
propriety, the whole tribe of sea shell-fish would then have equal
pretensions, and a very troublesome innovation would be brought into our
language, which is already formed. Ex∣cluding such animals, therefore, from
the insect tribe, we may define insects to be <HI>little animals without
red blood, bones or cartilages, furnished with a trunk, or else a mouth,
opening lengthwise, with eyes which they are incapable of covering, and with
lungs which have their openings on the sides.</HI> This definition
comprehends the whole class of insects, whether with or without wings,
whether in their caterpillar or butterfly state, whether produced in the
ordinary method of generation between male and female, or from an animal that
is itself both male and female, or from the same animal cut into several
parts, and each part reproducing a perfect animal.</P>
<P>From hence it appears, that in this class of animals there
are numerous distinctions, and that a general description will by no means
serve for all. Almost every species has its own di∣stinct history;
and exhibits manners, appetites, and modes of propagation, peculiarly its own.
In the larger ranks of existence, two animals that nearly resemble each
other in form will be <PB N="240" REF="245"/> found to have a similar
history; but here insects almost entirely alike will be often found
per∣fectly dissimilar, as well in their manner of bringing forth and
subsisting as in the changes which they undergo during their short
lives. Thus as this class is prolific beyond computa∣tion, so are its
varieties multiplied beyond the power of description. The attempt to
enume∣rate all the species of a fly or a moth would be very fruitless; but
to give an history of all would be utterly impracticable; so various are
the appetites, the manners, and the lives of this humble class of beings,
that every species re∣quires its distinct history. An exact plan,
there∣fore, of Nature's operations in this minute set of creatures is not to
be expected; and yet such a general picture may be given, as is sufficient
to shew the protection which Providence affords its smallest as well as
its largest productions, and to display that admirable circulation in
nature by which one set of living beings find sub∣sistence from the
destruction of another; and by which life is continued without a pause in
every part of the creation.</P>
<P>Upon casting a slight view over the whole insect tribe
just when they are supposed to rouze from their state of annual
torpidity, when they begin to feel the genial influence of spring, and again
exhibit new life in every part of nature, <PB N="241" REF="246"/> their numbers
and their varieties seem to exceed all powers of calculation, and they are
indeed too great for description. When we look closer, however, we shall
find some striking similitudes, either in their propagation, their
manners, or their form, that give us a hint for grouping several of them into
one description, and thus enabling us to shorten the labour of a separate
history for every species. Swammerdam, Reau∣mur, and Linnaeus, have each
attempted to abridge the task of description, by throwing a number of
similar animals into distinct classes, and thus making one general
history stand for all. I will avail myself of their labours; and uniting
their general distinctions, throw the whole class of insects into four
separate distri∣butions, giving under each the history of every species
that seems to me considerable enough to deserve our notice. Thus our
labour will be shortened; and the very rank in which an insect is placed
will, in some measure, exhibit a con∣siderable part of its history.</P>
<P>In our cursory inspection of the insect tribe, the
first animals that offer themselves are those which want wings, that
appear crawling about on every plant, and on every spot of earth we regard
with any degree of attention. Of these, some never obtain wings at any
period of their <PB N="242" REF="247"/> existence, but are destined to creep
on the ve∣getable, or the spot of earth where they are stationed, for their
whole lives. On the con∣trary, others are only candidates for a more happy
situation; and only wait their growing wings, when they may be said to
arrive at their state of full perfection.</P>
<P>Those that never have wings, but creep about till they die,
may be considered as constituting the <HI>first</HI> class of
insects. All these, the flea and the wood-louse only excepted, are
produced from an egg; and when once they break the shell, they never suffer
any further change of form, but continue to grow larger till they die. Thus the
louse or the spider are produced from an egg, never suffering any
alteration when once they are ex∣cluded; but, like the chicken or the duck,
remaining invariably the same, from their birth to their dissolution.</P>
<P>The second order of insects consists of such as have
wings; but which, when produced from the egg, have those wings cased up in
such a manner as not to appear. This casing up of the wing, however, does
not prevent the ani∣mal's running, leaping, and moving with its natural
celerity; but when the case bursts, and the wings have a power of
expanding, all <PB N="243" REF="248"/> the animal's motions become more
extensive, and the animal arrives at full perfection. Thus the grasshopper,
the dragon fly, and the ear∣wig, have their wings at first bound down; but
when the skin that, like a pair of stays, kept them confined, bursts,
they are then expanded, and the animal pursues the purposes for which it
was produced.</P>
<P>The third order of insects is of the moth and butterfly
kind. These all have four wings, each covered with a mealy substance of
various co∣lours, which when handled comes off upon the fingers; and, if
examined by the microscope, will appear like scales, with which the wing is
nicely embroidered all over. These insects also are produced in a manner
peculiar to them∣selves. They are first hatched from an egg, from whence
proceeds a caterpillar that eats, and often casts its skin; the caterpillar
having divested itself for the last time, assumes a new covering,
which is called a chrysalis, or the cone in the silk-worm, in which it
continues hidden till it comes forth a perfect moth or butterfly.</P>
<P>The fourth order is of those winged insects which come
from a worm instead of a cater∣pillar, and yet go through changes similar
to <PB N="244" REF="249"/> those which moths and butterflies are seen to
undergo. They are first excluded from the egg as a worm, and then become a
chrysalis; in some, their wings and legs are seen; in others, the animal
is quite detached from the cone in which it is concealed; but all at length
break their prison, and come out perfect winged ani∣mals; some furnished
with two wings and some with four. The wings of all these differ from
those of the butterfly and moth kind, by not having the mealy scales which
are ever found on the wings of the former. In this class we may place the
numerous tribes of gnats, beetles, bees, and flies.</P>
<P>To these I will add, as a fifth order, a nu∣merous tribe
lately discovered, to which na∣turalists have given the name of Zoophytes.
These do not go through the ordinary forms of generation, but may be
propagated by dissection. Some of these, though cut into an hundred
parts, still retain life in each, and are endued with such a vivacious
principle, that every part will in a short time become a perfect animal. They
seem a set of creatures placed between animals and vegetables, and make the
shade that connects animated and insensible nature. To this class
belong the polypus, the earth∣worm, and all the varieties of the
sea-nettle.</P>
<P><PB N="245" REF="250"/>Having thus given a general
distribution of insects, I will poceed to describe each class in the
order I have mentioned them; beginning with insects without wings, as they
more nearly resemble the higher ranks of nature, as well in their habits as
their conformation.</P>

<PB N="246" REF="251"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. II. Of Insects without Wings.</HEAD>
<P>EVERY moment's observation furnishes us with instances
of insects without wings; but the difficulty is to distinguish those
which are con∣demned continually to lead reptile lives, from such as only
wait the happy moment of trans∣mutation. For this, nothing but a long and
intimate acquaintance will suffice; but, in ge∣neral, all animals
resembling the flea, the louse, the spider, the bug, the wood-louse,
the water-louse, and the scorpion, never acquire wings, but are produced
from the egg in that form which they never change afterwards.</P>
<P>If we consider this class as distinct from others, we
shall find them in general longer lived than the rest, and often continuing
their term beyond one season, which is the ordinary period of an insect's
existence. They seem also less subject to the influence of the
weather; and often endure the rigours of winter without being numbed into
torpidity. The whole race of moths, butterflies, bees, and flies, are ren∣dered
lifeless by the return of cold weather; but we need not be told, that the
louse, the flea, <PB N="247" REF="252"/> and many of these wingless
creatures that seem formed to teize mankind, continue their painful
depredations the whole year round.</P>
<P>They come to perfection in the egg, as was said before; and
it sometimes happens, that when the animal is interrupted in performing the
offices of exclusion, the young ones burst the shell within the parent's
body, and are thus brought forth alive. This not unfre∣quently happens with the
wood-louse, and others of the kind, which are sometimes seen producing
eggs, and sometimes young ones perfectly formed.</P>
<P>Though these creatures are perfect from the beginning, yet
they are often, during their ex∣istence, seen to change their skin: this
is a fa∣culty which they possess in common with many of the higher ranks
of animals, and which answers the same purposes. However tender their
skins may seem to our feel, yet, if com∣pared to the animal's strength
and size, they will be found to resemble a coat of mail or, to talk more
closely, the shell of a lobster. By this skin these animals are
defended from accidental injuries, and particularly from the attacks of each
other. Within this they continue to grow, till their bodies become so large
as to be im∣prisoned in their own covering, and then the 
<PB N="248" REF="253"/> shell bursts, but is quickly replaced by a new
one.</P>
<P>Lastly, these animals are endued with a de∣gree of
strength for their size, that at first might exceed
credibility.—Had man an equal degree of strength, bulk for bulk, with a
louse or flea, the history of Samson would be no longer
miraculous.—A flea will draw a chain an hundred times heavier than
itself; and to compensate for this force, will eat ten times its own size
of provision in a single day.</P>

<P><PB N="249" REF="255"/>THE animal that deserves our first
notice in this principal order of insects is the spider, whose manners
are of all others the most subtle, and whose instincts are most
various. Formed for a life of rapacity, and incapable of living upon any other
than insect food, all its habits are calculated to deceive and surprize; it
spreads toils to entangle its prey; it is endued with patience to expect its
coming; and is possessed of arms and strength to destroy it when
fallen into the snare.</P>
<P>In this country, where all the insect tribes are kept under
by human assiduity, the spiders are but small and harmless. We are
acquainted with few, but the house-spider, which weaves its web in
neglected rooms; the garden-spider, that spreads its toils from tree to
tree, and rests in the center; the wandering-spider, that has no abode like
the rest; and the field spider, that is sometimes seen mounting, web
and all, into the clouds. These are the chief of our native spiders; which,
though reputed venom∣ous, are entirely inoffensive. But they form 
<PB N="250" REF="256"/> a much more terrible tribe in Africa and Ame∣rica. In
those regions, where all the insect species acquire their greatest
growth, where the butterfly is seen to expand a wing as broad as our
sparrow, and the ant to build an habita∣tion as tall as a man, it is not to
be wondered at that the spiders are seen bearing a propor∣tionable
magnitude. In fact, the bottom of the Martinico spider's body is as large as
a hen's egg, and covered all over with hair. Its web is strong, and its bite
dangerous. It is happy for us, however, that we are placed at a distance from
these formidable creatures, and that we can examine their history without
feeling their resentment.</P>
<P>Every spider has two divisions in its body. The fore-part,
containing the head and breast, is separated from the hinder part or belly
by a very slender thread, through which, however, there is communication from
one part to the other. The fore part is covered with a hard shell, as well as
the legs, which adhere to the breast. The hinder part is cloathed with a
supple skin, beset all over with hair. They have several eyes all round
the head, brilliant and acute; these are sometimes eight in number,
sometimes but six; two behind, two before, and the rest on each side.
Like <PB N="251" REF="257"/> all other insects, their eyes are immoveable; and
they want eye-lids; but this organ is fortified with a transparent horny
substance, which at once secures and assists their vision. As the
animal procures its subsistence by the most watchful attention, so
large a number of eyes was necessary to give it the earliest information
of the capture of its prey. They have two pincers on the fore-part of the head,
rough, with strong points, toothed like a saw, and ter∣minating in claws
like those of a cat. A little below the point of the claw there is a small
hole, through which the animal emits a poison, which, though harmless to
us, is sufficiently capable of instantly destroying its prey. This is the
most powerful weapon they have against their enemies; they can open or
extend these pincers as occasion may require; and when they are
undisturbed, they suffer them to lie one upon the other, never opening them
but when there is a necessity for their exertion. They have all eight legs,
jointed like those of lobsters, and similar also in another respect;
for if a leg be torn away, or a joint cut off, a new one will quickly grow in
its place, and the animal will find itself fitted for combat as be∣fore. At
the end of each leg there are three crooked moveable claws; namely, a small
one, <PB N="252" REF="258"/> placed higher up, like a cock's spur, by the
assistance of which it adheres to the threads of its web. There are two
others larger, which meet together like a lobster's claw, by which they can
catch hold of the smallest depressions, walking up or down the very
polished surfaces, on which they can find inequalities that are
imperceptible to our grosser sight. But when they walk upon such bodies
as are perfectly smooth, as looking glass or polished marble, they
squeeze a little sponge, which grows near the extremity of their claws, and
thus diffusing a glutinous substance, adhere to the surface until they
make a second step. Besides the eight legs just mentioned, these
animals have two others, which may more properly be called arms, as they do not
serve to assist motion, but are used in holding and managing their
prey.</P>
<P>The spider, though thus formidably equipped, would seldom
prove successful in the capture, were it not equally furnished with other
instru∣ments to assist its depredations. As it lives wholly upon flies,
and is without wings to pursue them, it is obvious they must for ever
escape so impotent an adversary; but the spider is a most experienced
hunter, and spreads its nets to catch those animals it is unable to
pur∣sue. The spider's web is generally laid in those 
<PB N="253" REF="259"/> places where flies are most apt to come and shelter;
in the corners of rooms, round the edges of windows, and in the open air among
the branches of trees. There the little animal remains for days, nay weeks
together, in pa∣tient expectation, seldom changing its situation though
never so unsuccessful.</P>
<P>For the purposes of making this web, Na∣ture has supplied
this animal with a large quan∣tity of glutinous matter within its body, and
five dugs or teats for spinning it into thread. This substance is
contained in a little bag, and at first sight it resembles soft glue;
but when examined more accurately, it will be found twisted into many coils
of an agate colour, and upon breaking it, the contents may be easily drawn
out into threads, from the tenacity of the substance, not from those
threads being already formed. Those who have seen the machine by which wire
is spun, will have an idea of the manner in which this animal forms the
threads of its little net, the orifices of the five teats above-mentioned,
through which the thread is drawn, contracting or dilating at plea∣sure. The
threads which we see, and appear so fine, are, notwithstanding,
composed of five joined together, and these are many times doubled when the
web is in formation.</P>
<P><PB N="254" REF="260"/>When a house-spider proposes to
begin a web, it first makes choice of some commo∣dious spot, where there
is an appearance of plunder and security. The animal then distils one
little drop of its glutinous liquor, which is very tenacious, and then creeping
up the wall, and joining its thread as it proceeds, it darts itself in a very
surprising manner, as I have often seen, to the opposite place, where
the other end of the web is to be fastened. The first thread thus formed,
drawn tight, and fixed at each end, the spider then runs upon it backward and
forward, still assiduously em∣ployed in doubling and strengthening
it, as upon its force depends the strength and stabi∣lity of the whole. The
scaffolding thus com∣pleted, the spider makes a number of threads parallel
to the first, in the same manner, and then crosses them with others;
the clammy substance of which they are formed, serving to bind them, when
newly made, to each other. The insect, after this operation, doubles and
trebles the thread that borders its web, by opening all its teats at once, and
secures the edges, so as to prevent the wind from blow∣ing the work away.
The edges being thus fortified, the retreat is next to be attended to; and this
is formed like a funnel at the bottom <PB N="255" REF="261"/> of the web, where
the little creature lies con∣cealed. To this are two passages, or outlets,
one above and the other below, very artfully contrived, to give the animal an
opportunity of making excursions at proper seasons, of pry∣ing into every
corner, and cleaning those parts which are observed to be clogged or
encum∣bered. Still attentive to its web, the spider, from time to time,
cleans away the dust that gathers round it, which might otherwise clog and
incommode it: for this purpose, it gives the whole a shake with its paws;
still, however, proportioning the blow so as not to endanger the fabric. It
often happens also, that from the main web there are several threads
extended at some distance on every side: these are, in some
measure, the outworks of the fortification, which, whenever touched from
without, the spider prepares for attack or self-defence. If the insect
impinging be a fly, it springs for∣ward with great agility; if, on the
contrary, it be the assault of an enemy stronger than itself, it keeps
within its fortress, and never ventures out till the danger be over. Another
advantage which the spider reaps from this contrivance of a cell or retreat
behind the web, is, that it serves for a place where the creature 
<PB N="256" REF="262"/> can feast upon its game with all safety, and conceal
the fragments of those carcasses which it has picked, without exposing
to public view the least trace of barbarity, that might create a
suspicion in any insects that their enemy was near.</P>
<P>It often happens, however, that the wind, or the rustling of
the branches, or the approach of some large animal, destroys in a minute
the labours of an age. In this case, the spider is obliged to remain a
patient spectator of the universal ruin; and when the danger is passed
away, it sets about repairing the calamity. For this purpose, it is
furnished with a large store of the glutinous substance of which the
web is made; and with this, it either makes a new web, or patches up the old
one. In general, however, the animal is much fonder of mending than making, as
it is furnished originally with but a certain quantity of glu∣tinous matter,
which, when exhausted, nothing can renew. The time seldom fails to come,
when their reservoirs are entirely dried up, and the poor animal is left to
all the chances of irretrievable necessity. An old spider is thus
frequently reduced to the greatest extremity; its web is destroyed, and it
wants the materials <PB N="257" REF="263"/> to make a new one. But as these
animals have been long accustomed to a life of shift∣ing, it hunts about to
find out the web of another spider, younger and weaker than itself, with
whom it ventures a battle. The invader generally succeds; the young one is
driven out to make a new web, and the old one remains in quiet
possession. If, however, the spider is unable to dispossess
any other of its web, it then endeavours, for a while, to subsist upon
accidental depredation; but in two or three months it inevitably dies of
hunger.</P>
<P>The garden-spider seems to work in a dif∣ferent manner.
The method with this insect is to spin a great quantity of thread, which
floating in the air in various directions, hap∣pens from its glutinous quality,
at last to stick to some object near it, a lofty plant or the branch of a
tree. The spider only wants to have one end of the line fast, in order to
secure and tighten the other. It accordingly draws the line when thus fixed,
and then by passing and repassing upon it, strengthens the thread in
such a manner as to answer, all its intentions. The first cord being thus
stretched, the spider walks along a part of it, and there fastens
ano∣ther, and dropping from thence, fastens the thread to some solid body
below, then climbs <PB N="258" REF="264"/> up again and begins a third, which it
fastens by the same contrivance. When three threads are thus fixed, it
forms a square, or something that very nearly resembles one; and in this
the animal is generally seen to reside. It often happens, however, when the
young spider begins spinning, that its web becomes too buoyant, and not
only the thread floats in the air, but even the little spinster. In this
manner we have often seen the threads of spiders floating in the air; and
what is still more surprizing, the young spiders themselves attached to
their own web. The reason is obvious; for as even gold itself may be so
finely drawn out as to float in the air, so the finer thread of a spider is
so buoyant as not only to swim in the air, but also to lift the spider
itself; which, like the tail of a kite, rises with its own manufacture.</P>
<P>The spider's web being thus compleated, and fixed in a
proper place, its next care is to seize and secure whatever insect
happens to be caught in the toil. For this purpose, it remains for weeks and
even months upon the watch, with∣out ever catching a single fly; for the
spider, like most other insects, is surprizingly patient of hunger. It
sometimes happens that too strong a fly strikes itself against the
web, and <PB N="259" REF="265"/> thus, instead of being caught, tears the net
to pieces. In general, however, the butterfly or the hornet, when they touch
the web, fly off again, and the spider seems no way disposed to
interrupt their retreat. The large blue-bottle∣fly, the ichneumon-fly, and the
common meat∣fly; seem to be its favourite game. When one of these strike
into the toils, the spider is in∣stantly seen alert and watchful at the
mouth of its hole, careful to observe whether the fly be compleatly
immeshed. If that be the case, the spider walks leisurely forward,
seizes its prey, and instantly kills it by instilling a venomous juice
into the wound it makes. If, however, the fly be not entirely immeshed, the
spider patiently waits, without appearing until its prey has fatigued
itself by its struggles to obtain its liberty; for if the ravager should
appear in all his terrors while the prey is but half involved, a desperate
effort might give it force enough to get free. If the spider has fasted for
a long time, it then drags the fly immediately into its hole and devours it;
but if there has been plenty of game, and the animal be no way pressed by
hunger, it then gives the fly two or three turns in its web, so as compleatly
to immesh it, and there leaves it impotently to struggle until the little
tyrant comes to its ap∣petite. <PB N="260" REF="266"/> Why the spider should
at one time kill its prey, and at another suffer it to struggle in the
toils for several hours together, I am not able to say; perhaps it only
likes its prey newly killed, and therefore delays to put the captive to death
until it is to be eaten.</P>
<P>It has been the opinion of some philosophers, that the
spider was in itself both male and fe∣male; but Lister has been able to
distinguish the sexes, and to perceive that the males were much less in
size than the females. But this is not the chief peculiarity; for, different
from all other animals, except the fish called the Ray, it has its
instruments of generation placed in the fore-arms, which have been already
described. When these animals copulate, they for some time teize each
other with their legs and arms, then appear the instruments of ge∣neration in
the male, as if bursting out from the points of its fore-feet, and are
inserted into the receptacle beneath the body of the female.</P>
<P>The female generally lays from nine hundred to a thousand
eggs in a season; they are of a bluish colour, speckled with black, and
sepa∣rated from each other by a glutinous substance, not unlike frog
spawn water. These eggs are large or small in proportion to the size of
the animal that produces them. In some they are <PB N="261" REF="267"/> as
large as a grain of mustard-seed; in others, they are scarcely visible.
The female never begins to lay till she be two years old at the least, and
her first brood is never so numerous as when she has come to her
greatest maturity.</P>
<P>When the number of eggs which the spider has brought forth
have remained for an hour or two to dry after exclusion, the little animal
then prepares to make them a bag, where they are to be hatched until they leave
the shell. For this purpose, she spins a web four or five times
stronger than that made for catching flies; and besides, lines it within
side by a down, which she plucks from her own breast. This bag, when
compleated, is as thick as paper, is smooth within side, but rougher
without. Within this they deposit their eggs; and it is almost incredible
to relate the concern and in∣dustry which they bestow in the preservation
of it. They stick it by means of their glutinous fluid to the end of their
body; so that the ani∣mal, when thus loaded, appears as if she had one body
placed behind another. If this bag be separated from her by any accident,
she employs all her assiduity to stick it again in its former
situation, and seldom abandons her treasure but with her life. When the
young ones are excluded from their shells, within the <PB N="262" REF="268"/>
bag, they remain for some time in their con∣finement, until the female,
instinctively knowing their maturity, bites open their prison, and sets
them free. But her parental care does not terminate with their exclusion;
she receives them upon her back for some time, until they have strength
to provide for themselves, when they leave her never to return, and each
begins a separate manufactory of its own. The young ones begin to spin when
they can scarcely be discerned; and prepare for a life of plunder before
they have strength to overcome. Indeed, Nature seems to have formed them in
every respect for a life of hostility. No other insect is
possessed of such various powers of assault and defence; and they
are able to destroy animals ten times bigger than themselves. Even after a
severe defeat, they quickly recover of their wounds; and as for their legs,
they con∣sider the loss of them as but a small misfor∣tune, as they grow
again very speedily to their former magnitude.</P>
<P>Thus there is no insect to which they are not an enemy; but
what is more barbarous still, spiders are the enemies of each other. Mr.
Reaumur, who was fond of making expe∣riments upon insects, tried to turn the
labours of the spider to human advantage, and actually <PB N="263" REF="269"/>
made a pair of gloves from their webs. For this purpose, he collected a large
number of those insects together: he took care to have them constantly
supplied with flies, and the ends of young feathers, fresh picked from
chickens and pigeons, which being full of blood, are a diet that spiders are
particularly fond of. But notwithstanding all his care, he was soon
convinced that it was impracticable to rear them, since they were of such a
malignant nature, that they could never be brought to live in society; but
instead of their usual food, chose to devour each other. Indeed, were it
practicable to reconcile them to each other, it would require too much
attendance to rear up a sufficient number to make the project any way
useful. Their thread is four, if not five times finer than that of the
silk-worm; so that upon the smallest calculation, there must have
been sixty thousand spiders to make a single pound of silk. That
which Reaumur made use of, was only the web in which they de∣posited their
eggs, which is five times stronger than their ordinary manufacture.</P>
<P>Of this animal, there are several kinds, slightly
differing from each other, either in habits or conformation. The Water-spider
is the most remarkable of the number. This insect <PB N="264" REF="270"/>
resembles the common spider in its appearance, except that its hinder part
is made rather in the shape of a nine-pin than a ball. They differ in being
able to live as well by land as water; and in being capable of spinning as
well in one element as the other. Their appear∣ance under water is very
remarkable; for though they inhabit the bottom, yet they are never touched by
the element in which they reside, but are enclosed in a bubble of air that,
like a box, surrounds them on every side. This bubble has the bright
appearance, at the bot∣tom, of quicksilver; and within this, they perform
their several functions of eating, spin∣ning and sleeping, without its
ever bursting, or in the least disturbing their operations: some∣times,
the bubble is seen divided into three distinct apartments; and in the
spring, the male enters one of those to impregnate the female, in the
manner mentioned above, while the bubble in which he was contained unites with
the other, like two drops of water, when approached to each other. They spin
their webs as well in the water as upon land; and it is most probable that
they make their food of the small insects of either element.</P>
<P>The Tarantula is also of this species, and de∣serves
particular notice, not for any remarkable <PB N="265" REF="271"/> properties
that really attend it, but for the nu∣merous falsehoods which have been
propagated concerning it. What may be said with truth concerning it is, that
it is the largest of the spider kind known in Europe, and is a native of
Apulia in Italy. Its body is three quarters of an inch long, and about as thick
as one's little finger; the colour is generally an olive brown, variegated with
one that is more dusky; it has eight legs and eight eyes, like the rest,
and nippers, which are sharp and serrated: be∣tween these and the fore
legs, there are two little horns, or feelers, which it is observed to move
very briskly when it approaches its prey. It is covered all over the body
with a soft down; and propagates, as other spiders, by laying eggs. In the
summer months, particularly in the dog days, the tarantula creeping among the
corn, bites the mowers and passengers; but in winter, it lurks in holes,
and is seldom seen.</P>
<P>Thus far is true; but now the fable begins: for though the
bite is attended with no dan∣gerous symptoms, and will easily cure of
itself, wonderful stories are reported concerning its virulence. The part
which is bitten, as we are told, is soon after discoloured with a livid
black, or yellowish circle, attended with an inflam∣mation. At first the
pain is scarcely felt; but <PB N="266" REF="272"/> a few hours after, come on
a violent sickness, difficulty of breathing, fainting, and sometimes
trembling. The person bit, after this does no∣thing but laugh, dance and
skip about, putting himself into the most extravagant postures; and
sometimes also is seized with a most frightful melancholly. At the
return of the season in which he was bit, his madness begins again; and
the patient always talks of the same things. Sometimes he fancies himself a
shepherd; some∣times a king; appearing entirely out of his senses.
These troublesome symptoms sometimes return for several years
successively, and at last terminate in death. But so dreadful a
disorder has it seems not been left without a remedy; which is no other
than a well played fiddle. For this purpose the medical musician plays a
particular tune, famous for the cure, which he begins slow, and encreases
in quickness as he sees the patient affected. The patient no sooner hears
the music, but he begins to dance; and continues so doing till he is all
over in a sweat, which forces out the venom that appeared so dangerous.
This dancing sometimes continues for three or four hours, before the patient
is weary, and before the sweating is copious enough to cure the disorder.
Such are the symptoms related of the tarantula poison; symptoms which 
<PB N="267" REF="273"/> some of the best and gravest physicians have
credited, and attempted to account for. But the truth is, that the whole is an
imposition of the peasants upon travellers who happen to pass through
that part of the country, and who pro∣cure a trifle for suffering
themselves to be bitten by the tarantula. Whenever they find a tra∣veller
willing to try the experiment, they readily offer themselves; and are sure
to counterfeit the whole train of symptoms which music is sup∣posed to
remove. A friend of mine, who passed through that part of the country, had
a trusty servant bitten, without ever administring the musical cure:
the only symptoms were a slight inflammation, which was readily removed,
and no other consequence ever attended the bite.—It is thus that
falsehoods prevail for a century or two; and mankind at last begin to
wonder how it was possible to keep up the delusion so long.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. Of the Flea.</HEAD>
<P>THE history of those animals with which we are the best
acquainted, are the first objects of our chiefest curiosity. There are
few but are well informed of the agility and the blood-thirsty
dis∣position of the Flea; of the caution with which it comes to the attack;
and the readiness with which it avoids the pursuit. This insect, which is
not only the enemy of mankind, but of the dog, cat, and several other
animals, is found in every part of the world, but bites with greater severity
in some countries than in others. Its numbers in Italy and France are much
greater than in England; and yet its bite is much more troublesome here, than
I have found it in any other place. It would seem that its force en∣creased
with the coldness of the climate; and though less prolific, that it became
more pre∣daceous.</P>
<P>If the flea be examined with a microscope, it will be
observed to have a small head, large eyes, and a roundish body. It has
two feelers, or horns, which are short, and composed of four joints; and
between these lies its trunk, which <PB REF="275"/>

</FIGURE> <PB N="269" REF="276"/> it buries in the skin, and
through which it sucks the blood in large quantities. The body ap∣pears to be
all over curiously adorned with a suit of polished sable armour, neatly
jointed, and beset with multitudes of sharp pins, almost like the quills
of a porcupine. It has six legs, the joints of which are so adapted, that
it can, as it were, fold them up one within another; and when it leaps, they
all spring out at once, whereby its whole strength is exerted, and the body
raised above two hundred times its own diameter.</P>
<P>The young fleas are at first a sort of nits or eggs, which
are round and smooth; and from these proceed white worms, of a shining
pearl colour: in a fortnight's time they come to a tolerable size, and are
very lively and active; but if they are touched at this time, they roll
themselves up in a ball: soon after this they begin to creep, like
silk-worms that have no legs; and then they seek a place to lie hid in,
where they spin a silken thread from their mouth, and with this they
enclose themselves in a small round bag or case, as white within as
writing paper, but dirty without: in this they continue for a fortnight longer;
after which they burst from their confinement perfectly formed, and armed
with powers to disturb the peace of an emperor.</P>

<DIV3 N="5" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="270" REF="277"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. V. Of the Louse and its Varieties.</HEAD>
<P>THE antipathies of mankind are various; some considering
the toad, some the serpent, some the spider, and some the beetle,
with a strong degree of detestation: but while all wonder at the
strangeness of each other's aver∣sions, they all seem to unite in their
dislike to the Louse, and regard it as their natural and most nauseous
enemy. Indeed, it seems the enemy of man in the most odious degree; for
wherever wretchedness, disease, or hunger seize upon him, the louse
seldom fails to add itself to the tribe, and to encrease in proportion to
the number of his calamities.</P>
<P>In examining the human louse with the mi∣croscope, its
external deformity first strikes us with disgust: the shape of the
fore part of the head is somewhat oblong; that of the hind part somewhat
round: the skin is hard, and being stretched, transparent, with here and
there se∣veral bristly hairs: in the fore part is a proboscis or
sucker, which is seldom visible: on each side of the head are antennae,
or horns, each divided into five joints, covered with bristly hair; and 
<PB N="271" REF="278"/> several white vessels are seen through these
horns: behind these are the eyes, which seem to want those divisions
observable in other insects, and appear encompassed with some few
hairs: the neck is very short, and the breast is divided into three parts;
on each side of which are placed six legs, consisting of six joints,
covered also with bristly hairs: the ends of the legs are armed with two
smaller and larger ruddy claws, serving those insects as a finger and
thumb, by which they catch hold of such objects as they approach: the end of
the body terminates in a cloven tail, while the sides are all over hairy; the
whole resembling clear parchment, and, when roughly pressed, cracking
with a noise.</P>
<P>When we take a closer view, its white veins, and other
internal parts appear; as likewise a most wonderful motion in its
intestines, from the transparency of its external covering. When the
louse feeds, the blood is seen to rush, like a torrent, into the
stomach; and its greediness is so great, that the excrements contained in
the intestines are ejected at the same time, to make room for this new
supply.</P>
<P>The louse has neither beak, teeth, nor any kind of mouth, as
Doctor Hooke described it; for the entrance into the gullet is absolutely
closed. In the place of all these, it has a pro∣boscis 
<PB N="272" REF="279"/> or trunk; or, as it may be otherwise called, a pointed
hollow sucker, with which it pierces the skin, and sucks the human blood,
taking that for food only. The stomach is lodged partly in the breast and
back; but the greatest portion of it is in the abdomen. When swolen with
blood, it appears of a dark brown colour, which is visible through the
skin; and is either a faint red, or a full or bright brown, as the contents
of the stomach are more or less changed. When it is empty, it is
colourless; but when filled, it is plainly discernible, and its motion
seems very extraordinary. It then appears working with very strong
agitations, and somewhat resembles an animal within an animal. Superficial
observers are apt to take this for the pulsation of the heart; but if the
animal be observed when it is sucking, it will then be found that the food
takes a direct pas∣sage from the trunk to the stomach, where the
remainder of the old aliment will be seen mixing with the new, and agitated
up and down on every side.</P>
<P>If this animal be kept from food two or three days, and then
placed upon the back of the hand, or any soft part of the body, it will
im∣mediately seek for food; which it will the more readily find, if the hand
be rubbed till it grows <PB N="273" REF="280"/> red. The animal then turns its
head, which lies between the two fore legs, to the skin, and diligently
searches for some pore: when found, it fixes the trunk therein; and soon
the mi∣croscope discovers the blood ascending through the head, in a very
rapid, and even frightful stream. The louse has at that time sufficient
appetite to feed in any posture; it is then seen sucking with its head
downward, and its tail elevated. If, during this operation, the skin be drawn
tight, the trunk is bound fast, and the animal is incapable of disengaging
itself; but it more frequently suffers from its gluttony, since it gorges
to such a degree, that it is crushed to pieces by the slightest
impression.</P>
<P>Whether lice are distinguished by the parts of generation
into males and females, is not yet discovered: Swammerdam is enclined to
think that they are hermaphrodites, having found an ovary in all those he
examined; and he dissected not less than forty-two. In one of these
animals were found ten large eggs; and forty-four smaller, that were not yet
come to their full perfection.</P>
<P>There is scarce any animal that multiplies so fast as
this unwelcome intruder. It has been pleasantly said, that a louse
becomes a grand∣father in the space of twenty-four hours: this 
<PB N="274" REF="281"/> fact cannot be ascertained; but nothing is more true
than, that the moment the nit, which is no other than the egg of the louse,
gets rid of its superfluous moisture, and throws off its shell, it then
begins to breed in its turn. Nothing so much prevents the encrease of this
nauseous animal, as cold and want of humidity; the nits must be laid in a
place that is warm, and mo∣derately moist, to produce any thing. This is the
reason that many nits laid on the hairs in the night-time, are destroyed by
the cold of the suceeding day; and so stick for several months, till
they at last come to lose even their external form.</P>
<P>The louse is found upon every part of the human body; but
particularly in the heads of children. Those found upon the miners in Sweden,
are said, by Linnaeus, to be very large; and he is of opinion, that the head
and the body-louse differ in no respect from each other. The Pthiriasis,
or lousy disease, though very little known at present, was frequent
enough among the ancients: Herod, Antiochus, Epi∣phanes, Alcman the poet,
Pherecydes, Cas∣sander, Callisthenes and Sylla, all died of this
disorder. The use of mercury, which was un∣known among the ancients, may
probably have banished it from among the moderns; for cer∣tain 
<PB N="275" REF="282"/> it is, that those animals seldom attack any in our
climate, but such as from sloth or famine invite their company.</P>
<P>Such is the history of the human louse; which, from its
connection with mankind, deserves first notice: but it would be endless
to de∣scribe the various tribes that go under this name, and swarm upon
every part of nature. There is scarce an animal, and scarce even a
vegetable, that does not suffer under its own peculiar louse. The sheep,
the horse, the hog, and the elephant, are all teized by them; the whale, the
shark, the salmon, and the lobster, are not without their company; while
every hot-house, and every gar∣den is infested with some peculiarly
destructive. Linnaeus tells us, that he once found a vege∣table-louse upon
some plants newly arrived from America; and willing to trace the little
animal through its various stages, he brought it with him from London to
Leyden; where he care∣fully preserved it during the winter, until it bred in
the spring: but the louse it seems did not treat him with all the
gratitude he expected; for it became the parent of so numerous a pro∣geny,
that it soon overrun all the physic-garden of that beautiful city; and
leaves, to this day, many a gardener to curse the Swede's too in∣dulgent
curiosity.</P>
<P><PB N="276" REF="283"/>The animal which some have called the
Leaf Louse, is of the size of a flea, and of a bright green, or bluish
green colour; the body is nearly oval, and is largest and most convex on
the hinder part; the breast is very small, and the head is blunt and green:
the eyes may be seen very plainly, being prominent on the fore part of the
head, and of a shining black colour; near these there is a black line on
each side; and the legs are very slender.</P>
<P>These animals are usually found upon the leaves of the
orache, and other plants; and the weaker the leaves and buds are, these
insects swarm upon them in greater abundance. Some plants are covered over
with them; though they are not the cause of the plants weakness, but the
sign: however, by wounding and sucking the leaf, they encrease the
disease. They ge∣nerally assume their colour from the plant on which
they reside. Those that feed upon pot∣herbs and plum trees, are of an
ash-colour; only they are greenish when they are young: those that belong
to the alder and cherry-tree, are black; as also those upon beans, and
some other plants: those on the leaves of apples and rose-trees, are
white: but as they leap, like grassshoppers, some place them in the
number of the flea kind. The most uncommon colour <PB N="277" REF="284"/> is
reddish; and lice of this sort may be found on the leaves of tansey; and
their juice, when rubbed in the hands, tinges them with no dis∣agreeable red.
All these live upon their re∣spective plant; and are often engendered
within the very substance of the leaf.</P>
<P>All these bring forth their young alive; and the faetus,
when it is ready to be brought forth, entirely fills the belly of the female;
its fore parts being excluded first, and then the hinder. The young one does
not begin to move till the horns or feelers appear out of the body of the old
one; and by the motion of these it first shews signs of life, moving
them in every di∣rection, and bending all their joints. When the horns and head
are excluded, the two fore feet follow, which they move with equal agility;
after this follow the middle feet, and then the hinder: still, however, the
young one continues sticking to its parent, supported only at one
extremity, and hanging as it were in air, until its small and soft members
become hardened and fitted for self-support. The parent then gets rid of
its burthen; by moving from the place where she was sitting, and forcing
the young one to stand upon its legs, leaves it to shift for itself.</P>
<P>As the animal has not far to go, its provision 
<PB N="278" REF="285"/> lying beneath it, during the summer it continues to
eat and creep about with great agility. But as it is viviparous, and must
necessarily lurk somewhere in winter, where its body may be defended from
the cold, it endeavours to secure a retreat near the trees or plants that
serve to nourish it in the beginning of spring. They never hide
themselves in the earth, like many other insects, because they have no
part of their bodies fitted to remove the earth; nor can they creep into every
chink, as their legs are too long: besides, their bodies are so tender,
that the least rough particle of the earth would hurt them. They therefore
get into the deep chinks of the bark, and into the cavities of the stronger
stalks, from whence they sally out upon the branches and leaves, when the
warmth of the sun begins to be felt. Neither the cold in the autumnal
season, nor the lesser degree of heat in the spring, ever hurts them;
they seldom, therefore, seek for hiding-places before the fall of the leaf,
and are alert enough to take the earliest advantage of the returning
spring.</P>
<P>Like many other insects, they cast their skins four
several times; and, what is very remarkable, the males have four wings, but
the females never have any. They all have long legs, not only to enable them to
creep over the long hairs of <PB N="279" REF="286"/> plants and leaves, but
also to travel from one tree to another, when they happen to stand at a
distance. Their trunk or snout lies under their breast; and this they
thrust into the pores of the plant to suck out the juice, for they do not
gnaw them, like the caterpillar; but so hurt them by sucking, that the
leaves become spotted, and as it were overrun with scabs; for which
reason their edges always turn up towards the middle.</P>
<P>It has been said, that these insects are often carried
away and devoured by ants; but this Frysch, from whom this description is
taken, could never observe. The ants indeed are fond of those trees where
there is a great number of those insects; but then it is only to suck the
juice which flows from the leaves that have been just wounded. This more
particularly happens in the heat of summer, when other moisture is wanting:
however, he never found them hurting or carrying away any of these insects
while alive; nor indeed were they able, for the leaf louse is more than a
match for the ant at single combat. Whenever they perceive the ant
approaching behind them, they kick back with their hinder feet, and thus drive
off the invader, as a horse would a lion.</P>
<P>The three principal and constant enemies to 
<PB N="280" REF="287"/> these insects are first, the fire-flie, which lays
its eggs where these insects are in greatest number, which producing a
worm, seizes and devours all the leaf lice that come near it: another enemy
is the worm of a peculiar kind of beetle, which destroys them in great
numbers: but the most formidable of all enemies, is the ichnenmon fly, that
seizes upon one of the largest females, and laying its egg upon her, this
is hatched into a worm, which soon devours and destroys the ani∣mal from
whose body it sprung.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI. Of the Bug and its Varieties.</HEAD>
<P>THE Bug is another of those nauseous insects that
intrude upon the retreats of mankind; and that often banish that sleep,
which even sorrow and anxiety permitted to approach. This, to many men, is,
of all other insects, the most troublesome and obnoxious. The night is
usually the season when the wretched have rest from their labour; but
this seems the only season when the bug issues from its retreats, to
make its depredations. By day it lurks, like a robber, in the most secret
parts of the bed; takes the advantage of every chink and cranny, to make a
secure lodgment; and contrives its habitation with so much art, that
scarce any industry can discover its retreat. It seems to avoid the
light with great cunning; and even if candles be kept burning, this formidable
in∣sect will not issue from its hiding-place. But when darkness
promises security, it then issues from every corner of the bed, drops
from the tester, crawls from behind the arras, and travels with great
assiduity to the unhappy patient, who vainly wishes for rest and
refreshment. It is <PB N="282" REF="289"/> generally vain to destroy one
only, as there are hundreds more to revenge their companion's fate; so that
the person who thus is subject to be bitten, remains the whole night like a
cen∣tinel upon duty, rather watching the approach of fresh invaders, than
inviting the pleasing approaches of sleep.</P>
<P>Nor are these insects less disagreeable from their
nauseous stench, than their unceasing ap∣petites. When they begin to
crawl, the whole bed is infected with the smell; but if they are accidentally
killed, then it is insupportable.</P>
<P>These are a part of the inconveniences that result from
the persecution of these odious in∣sects: but happily for Great Britain,
they mul∣tiply less in these islands, than in any part of the continent.
In France and Italy the beds, par∣ticularly in their inns, swarm with them;
and every piece of furniture seems to afford them a retreat. They grow larger
also with them than with us, and bite with more cruel appetite.</P>
<P>This animal, if examined minutely, appears to consist of
three principal parts; the head, the corselet, and the belly. It has two
brown eyes, that are very small, and a little prominent, besides two
feelers, with three joints: underneath these there is a crooked trunk, which
is its in∣strument of torture, and which, when in motion, 
<PB N="283" REF="290"/> lies close upon the breast. The breast is a kind
of ring, in which are placed the two first pair of legs. The belly
consists of nine rings; under which are placed two pair of legs more,
making six in all. Each leg has three joints, which form the thigh, the leg,
and the foot, which is armed with a crooked claw, like an hook. The body is
smooth, except a few short hairs, that may be seen by the microscope,
about the vent, and on the two last rings. Its motion is slow and unwieldy;
yet its sight is so exquisite, that the instant it perceives the light,
it generally makes good its retreat; and they are seldom caught, though the
bed swarms with them.</P>
<P>If we examine this insect internally, we shall find the
great artery, which in all insects per∣forms the functions of the heart; we
shall find the apertures of the lungs on the right side and the left,
through which the animal breathes; we shall find a stomach and
intestines, which, as in other animals, run from the mouth to the anus. If
the insect has been kept long fasting, there will be a mucous found in its
body, like the white of an egg; but if crushed after a full meal, the human
blood, which it has sucked in, will appear a little darkened by having
passed through the insect's body.</P>
<P>The male and female of these animals are 
<PB N="284" REF="291"/> plainly distinguishable from each other; and the
parts of generation are obvious enough. They are often found coupling tail to
tail; and in this state are very easily destroyed. The female has an
ovary filled with eggs, joined together like a bunch of grapes; each egg being
oblong, almost cylindrical, inclining to white, and pretty transparent. In
about two days after impregnation by the male, she deposits her eggs to the
number of about an hundred and fifty, in some convenient place where they are
likely to receive no disturbance. There they continue for some months;
during which time, neither cold nor heat, neither moisture nor fu∣migation,
can in the least retard their exclusion; but they come forth active, and
ready for mis∣chief. It is this hardiness in the shell that seems to
continue the breed; as the old ones die every winter, or are easily
destroyed by any fumigation that is used for that purpose. But the eggs
seem incapable of destruction; even those men who make a livelihood by
killing these nauseous insects, though they can answer for the parent,
can never be sure of the egg. For this reason they usually pay those
houses to which they are called a second or a third visit, and at last
ex∣terminate them by perseverance.</P>
<P>The manner of destroying them seems rather 
<PB N="285" REF="292"/> the effects of assiduity than antidote; for the men
called in upon this occasion, take every part of the furniture asunder,
brush every part of it with great assiduity, anoint it with a liquid,
which I take to be a solution of corrosive sub∣limate, and having
performed this operation twice or thrice, the vermin are most usually
destroyed.</P>
<P>Cleanliness, therefore, seems to be the best antidote to
remove these nauseous insects; and wherever that is wanting, their
encrease seems but a just punishment. Indeed, they are some∣times
found in such numbers among old fur∣niture, and neglected chambers, exposed
to the south, that, wanting other sustenance, they de∣vour each other.
They are also enemies to other vermin, and destroy fleas very effectually;
so that we seldom have the double persecution of different vermin in the
same bed. Of the bug kind Linnaeus reckons up forty.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VII. Of the Wood-Louse and its Varieties.</HEAD>
<P>THE common Wood Louse is seldom above half an inch long,
and a quarter of an inch broad. The colour is of a livid black, espe∣cially
when found about dung-hills, and on the ground; but those that are to be met
with un∣der tiles, and in drier places, are of the colour of the hair of an
ass. It has fourteen feet, seven on each side; and they have only one
joint each, which is scarcely perceivable. It has two short feelers, and
the body is of an oval shape. When it is touched, it rolls itself up into a
sort of a ball; and the sides, near the feet, are dentated, like a saw.
It is often found among rotten timber, and on decayed trees: in winter it lies
hid in the crevices of walls and all sorts of buildings. The male is easily
distinguishable from the female, being less, and more slender. The eggs
they lay are white and shining, like seed pearls, and are very numerous:
however, more properly speak∣ing, although, when excluded, the young have all
the appearance of an egg, yet they are alive, and, without throwing off any
shell, stir and <PB N="287" REF="294"/> move about with great vivacity; so
that this animal may properly be said to be viviparous. The little worms at
first seem scarce able to stir; but they soon feed, and become very
brisk. These animals are of great use in medicine: being impregnated with
a saline quality, which is diuretic and stimulating. Of this insect
Linnaeus makes three species.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII. Of the Monoculus, or Arborescent
Water-Flea.</HEAD>
<P>THIS animal, which is of the size of a flea, ap∣pears to the
sight, unassisted by the microscope, to have but one eye; for the
eyes, by reason of the smallness of the head, seem to be joined to each
other: they are situated in the trunk of this insect, and the beak is
likewise very small and sharp pointed. The structure of the eye is
seen, by the microscope, to be reticulated, or made like a net; and the
trunk of this insect, by which it feeds, is not only small and sharp, but
also transparent. The insects are of a blood red colour; and sometimes
are seen in such multitudes on the surface of standing water, as to
make them appear all over red, whence many fanciful people have thought the
water to be turned into blood.</P>
<P>Swammerdam tells us of a celebrated pro∣fessor of Leyden,
who was at first astonished by an appearance of this kind. Being once
intent upon his studies, he heard a noise, of which, as it encreased by
degrees, he was desirous to know the cause. The maid-servant attending to
his summons, appeared quite petrified with <PB N="289" REF="298"/> fear, and
told him, with a tremulous voice, that all the waters of Leyden were turned
into blood. Upon this he went directly in a small bark to the place where the
water was thus changed, and put some of the bloody water into a glass; but
upon viewing it with attention, he observed, that it abounded with infinite
num∣bers of these little red insects, which tinged the whole body of the
fluid with that seemingly formidable colour. Thus his sudden fright was
changed into lasting admiration.</P>
<P>Of all parts of this animal, its branching arms, and the
motion it makes with them in the water, deserve our greatest attention. By
these the little creature can move in a straight line; waving its arms, as
a bird does its wings in the air, sometimes upward, sometimes down∣ward,
sometimes to the right, sometimes to the left, yet still continuing to
proceed in a right line. By striking the water with its arms, it can ascend
with great velocity; and by striking in a contrary direction, it dives with
equal ease. As these motions are very rapid, the little ani∣mal appears to
jump in the water, its head always tending to the surface, and its tail
stretched downward. This insect is produced from an egg, which, when
excluded, is carried on the back of the female, and soon is seen 
<PB N="290" REF="299"/> floating in the water round her. Its ap∣pearance at
first is that of a very small whitish insect, endued with a very nimble
motion. Except in colour, it suffers no change, only continuing to grow
larger and redder, as it grows old. They sometimes remain several days on
the surface of the water; and sometimes are seen at the bottom only; but
they are never at rest. They change their skin, like most other
insects; and the cast skin resembles the insect itself so
exactly, that one might mistake the mask for the animal.</P>

<PB N="291" REF="300"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. IX. Of the Scorpion and its Varieties.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is scarce an insect without wings that is not
obnoxious to man: the smallest have the power of annoying him, either by
biting or stinging him; and though each is in itself con∣temptible, they
become formidable from their numbers. But of all this class, there is none
so terrible as the Scorpion, whose shape is hideous, whose size among
the insect tribe is enormous, and whose sting is generally fatal. Happy
for England, the scorpion is entirely a stranger among us! In several
parts of the continent of Europe it is but too well known, though it sel∣dom
grows above four inches long: but in the warm tropical climates, it is seen a
foot in length, and in every respect as large as a lobster.</P>
<P>The scorpion is one of the largest of the insect tribe,
and not less terrible from its size than its malignity. It resembles a
lobster some∣what in shape, but is infinitely more hideous. There have
been enumerated nine different kinds of this dangerous insect, chiefly
distin∣guished by their colour: there being scorpions 
<PB N="292" REF="301"/> yellow, brown, and ash coloured; others that are the
colour of rusty iron, green, pale yellow, black, claret colour, white, and
grey.</P>
<P>There are four principal parts distinguishable in this
animal; the head, the breast, the belly, and the tail. The scorpion's head
seems, as it were, jointed to the breast, in the middle of which are seen
two eyes; and a little more for∣ward, two eyes more, placed in the fore part of
the head: these eyes are so small, that they are scarcely perceivable;
and it is probable the animal has but little occasion for seeing. The mouth
is furnished with two jaws; the under∣most is divided into two, and the
parts notched into each other, which serves the animal as teeth, and with
which it breaks its food, and thrusts it into its mouth: these the
scorpion can at pleasure pull back into its mouth, so that no part of
them can be seen. On each side of the head are two arms, each composed of
four joints; the last of which is large, with strong muscles, and made in
the manner of a lobster's claw. Below the breast are eight articulated
legs, each divided into six joints; the two hind∣most of which are each
provided with two crooked claws, and here and there covered with hair. The
belly is divided into seven little rings; from the lowest of which is
continued a <PB N="293" REF="302"/> tail, composed of six joints, which are
bristly, and formed like little globes, the last being armed with a crooked
sting. This is that fatal instrument which renders this insect so
formi∣dable: it is long, pointed, hard and hollow; it is pierced near the
base by two small holes, through which, when the animal stings, it ejects
a drop of poison, which is white, caustic, and fatal. The reservoir in
which this poison is kept, is in a small bladder near the tail, into which
the venom is distilled by a peculiar apparatus. If this bladder be gently
pressed, the venom will be seen issuing out through the two holes
above∣mentioned; so that it appears, that when the animal stings, the
bladder is pressed, and the venom issues through the two apertures into
the wound.</P>
<P>There are few animals more formidable, or more truly
mischievous than the scorpion. As it takes refuge in a small place, and
is generally found sheltering in houses, so it cannot be other∣wise
than that it must frequently sting those among whom it resides. In
some of the towns of Italy, and in France, in the province of Lan∣guedoc, it
is one of the greatest pests that tor∣ment mankind: but its malignity in
Europe is trifling, when compared to what the natives of Africa, and the
east, are known to experience. <PB N="294" REF="303"/> In Batavia, where they
grow twelve inches long, there is no removing any piece of furniture, without
the utmost danger of being stung by them. Bosman assures us, that,
along the Gold Coast, they are often found larger than a lob∣ster; and that
their sting is inevitably fatal. In Europe, however, they are by no means
so large, so venomous, or so plenty. The general size of this animal
does not exceed two or three inches; and its sting is very seldom found to
be fatal. Maupertius, who made several experiments on the scorpion of
Languedoc, found it by no means so invariably dangerous as had till then been
represented. He provoked one of them to sting a dog, in three places of the
belly, where the animal was without hair. In about an hour after the poor
animal seemed greatly swolen, and became very sick: he then cast up
whatever he had in his bowels; and, for about three hours, continued vomiting a
whitish liquid. The belly was always greatly swolen, when the animal be∣gan
to vomit; but this operation always seemed to abate the swelling; which
alternately swelled, and was thus emptied, for three hours
suc∣cessively. The poor animal, after this, fell into convulsions, bit
the ground, dragged himself along upon his fore feet, and at last died,
five hours after being bitten. He was not partially <PB N="295" REF="304"/>
swolen round the place which was bitten, as is usual after the sting of a
wasp or a bee; but his whole body was inflated, and there only ap∣peared a
red spot on the places where he had been stung.</P>
<P>Some days after, however, the same expe∣riment was tried
upon another dog, and even with more aggravated cruelty; yet the dog seemed
no way affected by the wounds, but howling a little when he received them,
con∣tinued alert and well after them; and soon after was set at liberty,
without shewing the smallest symptoms of pain. So far was this poor
creature from being terrified at the experiment, that he left his own
master's house, to come to that of the philosopher, where he had received
more plentiful entertainment. The same experiment was tried by fresh
scorpions, upon seven other dogs, and upon three hens; but not the
smallest deadly symptom was seen to ensue. From hence it appears,
that many circumstances, which are utterly unknown, must contribute to give
efficacy to the scorpion's venom. Whether its food, long fasting, the
season, the nature of the vessels it wounds, or its state of
maturity, contribute to, or retard its malignity, is yet to be ascertained by
succeeding experiment. In the trials made by our philosopher, he em∣ployed 
<PB N="296" REF="305"/> scorpions of both sexes, newly caught, and
seemingly vigorous and active. The suc∣cess of this experiment may
serve to shew that, many of those boasted antidotes which are given for
the cure of the scorpion's sting, owe their success rather to accident
than their own efficacy. They only happened to cure, when their sting was no
way dangerous; but in cases of actual malignity, they might probably be
utterly un∣serviceable.</P>
<P>The scorpion of the tropical climates being much larger than
the former, is probably much more venomous. Helbigius, however, who re∣sided
for many years in the east, assures us, that he was often stung by the
scorpion, and never received any material injury from the wound: a painful
tumour generally ensued; but he al∣ways cured it, by rubbing the part with a
piece of iron or stone, as he had seen the Indians practise before him,
until the flesh became in∣sensible. Seba, Moore and Bosman, however,
give a very different account of the scorpion's malignity; and assert
that, unless speedily re∣lieved, the wound becomes fatal.</P>
<P>It is certain that, no animal in the creation seems endued
with such an irascible nature. I have often seen them taken and put into
a place of security, exerting all their rage against the 
<PB N="297" REF="306"/> sides of the glass vessel that contained them. I
have seen them attempt to sting a stick, when put near them; and attack a
mouse or a frog, while those animals were far from offering any injury.
Maupertius put three scorpions and a mouse into the same vessel
together, and they soon stung the little animal in different places. The
mouse, thus assaulted, stood for some time upon the defensive, and
at last killed them all, one after another. He tried this experiment, in
order to see whether the mouse, after it had killed, would eat the
scorpions; but the little qua∣drupede seemed entirely satisfied with the
victory, and even survived the severity of the wounds it had received.
Wolkamer tried the courage of the scorpion against the large spider, and
en∣closed several of both kinds in glass vessels, for that
purpose<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Ephemerides. Dec. II. 1687. Observ.
224.</BIBL></NOTE>. The success of this combat was very remarkable. The
spider at first used all its efforts to immesh the scorpion in its
web, which it immediately began spinning; but the scorpion rescued
itself from the danger, by stinging its adversary to death: it soon
after cut off, with its claws, all the legs of the spider, and then sucked
all the internal parts at its leisure.—If the scorpion's skin had
not been so hard, Wol∣kamer is of opinion that the spider would have 
<PB N="298" REF="307"/> obtained the victory; for he had often seen one of
these spiders destroy a toad.</P>
<P>The fierce spirit of this animal is equally dangerous to its
own species; for scorpions are the cruellest enemies to each other.
Maupertius put about an hundred of them together in the same glass; and
they scarce came into contact, when they began to exert all their rage in
mutual destruction: there was nothing to be seen but one universal
carnage, without any distinction of age or sex; so that, in a few days,
there remained only fourteen, which had killed and devoured all the rest.</P>
<P>But their unnatural malignity is still more apparent, in
their cruelty to their offspring. He enclosed a female scorpion, big with
young, in a glass vessel, and she was seen to devour them as fast
as they were excluded: there was but one only of the number that escaped the
general destruction, by taking refuge on the back of its parent; and this
soon after revenged the cause of its brethren, by killing the old one in
its turn.</P>
<P>Such is the terrible and unrelenting nature of this insect,
which neither the bonds of society, nor of nature can reclaim: it is even
asserted that, when driven to an extremity, the scorpion will often
destroy itself. The following expe∣riment <PB N="299" REF="308"/> was
ineffectually tried by Maupertius: but I am so well assured of it by many
eye∣witnesses, who have seen it both in Italy and America, that I have no
doubt remaining of its veracity. A scorpion, newly caught, is placed in the
midst of a circle of burning charcoal, and thus an egress prevented on
every side: the scorpion, as I am assured, runs for about a minute
round the circle, in hopes of escaping; but finding that impossible, it
stings itself on the back of the head, and in this manner the un∣daunted
suicide instantly expires.</P>
<P>It is happy for mankind that these animals are thus
destructive to each other; since other∣wise they would multiply in so
great a degree as to render some countries uninhabitable. The male and female
of this insect are very easily distinguishable; the male being
smaller and less hairy. The female brings forth her young alive, and
perfect in their kind. Redi having bought a quantity of scorpions,
se∣lected the females, which by their size and roughness were easily
distinguishable from the rest, and putting them in separate glass
vessels, he kept them for some days without food. In about five days one
of them brought forth thirty-eight young ones, well shaped, and of a
milk-white colour, which changed every day more and <PB N="300" REF="309"/> more
into a dark rusty hue. Another female, in a different vessel, brought
forth twenty-seven of the same colour; and the day following the young ones
seemed all fixed to the back and belly of the female. For near a fortnight
all these continued alive and well; but afterwards some of them died daily:
until, in about a month, they all died, except two.</P>
<P>Were it worth the trouble, these animals might be kept
living as long as curiosity should think proper. Their chief food is worms
and insects; and upon a proper supply of these, their lives might be
lengthened to their natural extent. How long that may be we are not told; but
if we may argue from analogy, it cannot be less than seven or eight years;
and perhaps, in the larger kind, double that duration. As they have somewhat
the form of the lobster, so they resemble that animal in casting their
shell, or more properly their skin; since it is softer by far than the
covering of the lobster, and set with hairs, which grow from it in great
abun∣dance, particularly at the joinings. The young lie in the womb of the
parent, each covered up in its own membrane, to the number of forty or fifty,
and united to each other by an oblong thread, so as to exhibit altogether the
form of a chaplet.</P>
<P><PB N="301" REF="310"/>Such is the manner in which the common
scorpion produces its young: but there is a scorpion of America, produced
from the egg, in the manner of the spider. The eggs are no larger than pins
points; and they are deposited in a web, which they spin from their bodies,
and carry about with them, till they are hatched. As soon as the young ones
are excluded from the shell, they get upon the back of the parent, who turns
her tail over them, and defends them with her sting. It seems probable,
therefore, that captivity produces that unnatural dispo∣sition in the
scorpion, which induces it to destroy its young; since, at liberty, it is
found to protect them with such unceasing assiduity.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. X. Of the Scolopendra and Gally-worm.</HEAD>
<P>OF these hideous and angry insects we know little, except
the figure and the noxious qua∣lities. Though with us there are insects
some∣what resembling them in form, we are placed at an happy distance
from such as are really for∣midable. With us they seldom grow above an inch
long; in the tropical climates they are often found above a quarter of a
yard.</P>
<P>The Scolopendra is otherwise called the Centipes, from the
number of its feet; and it is very common in many parts of the world,
especially between the tropics. Those of the East-Indies, where they grow
to the largest size, are about six inches long, of a ruddy colour, and as
thick as a man's finger: they consist of many joints; and from each joint
is a leg on each side: they are covered with hair, and seem to have no
eyes; but there are two feelers on the head, which they make use of to find
out the way they are to pass: the head is very round, with two small
sharp teeth, with which they inflict wounds that are very painful and
dan∣gerous. A sailor that was bit by one on board <PB N="303" REF="312"/> a
ship, felt an excessive pain, and his life was supposed to be in
danger: however, he recovered, by the application of three roasted onions to
the part; and was soon quite well. Of this ani∣mal there are different kinds;
some living, like worms, in holes in the earth; others under stones, and
among rotten wood: so that nothing is more dangerous than removing those
substances, in the places where they breed.</P>
<P>The Gally-worm differs from the scolopendra, in having
double the number of feet; there be∣ing two on each side, to every joint of
the body. Some of these are smooth, and others hairy; some are yellow,
some black, and some brown. They are found among decayed trees, between the
wood and the bark; as also among stones that are covered with moss. They
all, when touched, contract themselves, rolling themselves up like a ball.
Whatever may be their qualities in the tropical parts of the world, in Europe
they are perfectly harmless; having been often handled and irritated, without
any vindictive consequences.</P>
<P>All these, as well as the scorpion, are sup∣posed to
be produced perfect from the parent, or the egg; and to undergo no changes,
after their first exclusion. They are seen of all sizes; 
<PB N="304" REF="313"/> and this is a sufficient inducement to suppose,
that they preserve their first appearance, through the whole of their
existence. It is probable, however, that, like most of this class, they
often change their skins; but of this we have no certain information.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XI. Of the Leech.</HEAD>
<P>THE last of this wingless tribe that I shall mention is
the Leech, which, like all the former, undergoes no varieties of
transformation; but when once excluded from the body of the pa∣rent,
preserves its first figure to the end. I place the history of the leech
among the first class of insects; while I have degraded the Earth-worm,
the Taenia, and the Polypus, into the class of zoophytes, or that imperfect
tribe which serves to make the shade between animal and vegetable nature.
Not but that the earth-worm or the polypus have their motions, their appetites,
and their vital principles, as compleat as the leech, and to a cursory view
appear every way as compleat animals. But there is one circum∣stance that
lays the line between them; that exalts the one and degrades the other. The
earth-worm and the polypus may be cut into pieces, and each piece will produce
a new and perfect animal: the leech cannot suffer this dissection, but
dies when cut in two; an evident instance that it is possessed of a
more perfect <PB N="306" REF="315"/> organization than those animals which it
other∣wise very much resembles.</P>
<P>The leech, from its uses in medicine, is one of those
insects that man has taken care to pro∣vide; but of a great variety, one kind
only is considered as serviceable. The horse-leech, which is the
largest of all, and grows to four inches in length, with a glossy black
surface, is of no use, as it will not stick to the skin; the
snail-leech is but an inch in length; and though it will stick, is not
large enough to extract a sufficient quantity of blood from the patient; the
broad tailed leech, which grows to an inch and an half in length, with the back
raised into a sort of a ridge, will stick but on very few occasions: it
is the large brown leech, with a whitish belly, that is made use of in
medicine, and whose history best merits our curiosity.</P>
<P>The leech has the general figure of a worm, and is about as
long as one's middle finger. Its skin is composed of rings, by means of
which it is possessed of its agility, and swims in water. It
contracts itself, when out of water, in such a manner, that when touched it
is not above an inch long. It has a small head, and a black skin, edged
with a yellow line on each side, with some yellowish spots on the back.
The belly also, which is <PB N="307" REF="316"/> of a reddish colour, is
marked with whitish yellow spots. But the most remarkable part of this
animal is the mouth, which is composed of two lips, that take whatever form
the insect finds convenient. When at rest, the opening is usually
triangular; and within it are placed three very sharp teeth, capable of
piercing not only the human skin, but also that of an horse or an ox.
Still deeper in the head, is disco∣vered the tongue, which is composed of a
strong fleshy substance, and which serves to assist the animal
in sucking, when it has inflicted its triple wound; for no sooner is this
voracious creature applied to the skin, than it buries its teeth therein,
then closes its lips round the wounds which it has made; and thus, in the
manner of a cupping-glass, extracts the blood as it flows to the different
orifices.</P>
<P>In examining this animal's form farther to∣wards the tail, it
is seen to have a gullet and an intestinal canal, into which the blood
flows in great abundance. On each side of this are seen running along
several little bladders, which, when the animal is empty, seem to be filled
with nothing but water; but when it is gorging blood, they seem to
communicate with the intestines, and receive a large portion of the blood
which flows into the body. If these bladders should be 
<PB N="308" REF="317"/> considered as so many stomachs, then every leech
will be found to have twenty-four. But what is most extraordinary of all in
this animal's formation is, that though it takes so large a quantity of food,
it has no anus or passage to eject it from the body when it has been
digested. On the contrary, the blood which the leech has thus sucked
remains for several months clotted within its body, blackened a little by the
change, but no way putrefied, and very little altered in its texture or
consistence. In what manner it passes through the animal's body, or how
it contributes to its nourishment, is not easily accounted for. The water
in which they are kept is very little discoloured by their continuance; they
cannot be supposed to return the blood by the same passage through
which it was taken in; it only remains, therefore, that it goes off through the
pores of the body, and that these are sufficiently large to permit its
exclusion.</P>
<P>But it is not in this instance alone that the leech differs
from all other insects. It was remarked in a former chapter, that the whole
insect tribe had the opening into their lungs placed in their sides, and
that they breathed through those apertures as other animals through the
mouth. A drop of oil poured on the sides <PB N="309" REF="318"/> of a wasp,
a bee, or a worm, would quickly suffocate them, by stopping up the
passages through which they breathe; but it is otherwise with the leech,
for this animal may be im∣mersed in oil without injury; nay, it will live
therein; and the only damage it will sustain is, that when taken out it
will be seen to cast a fine pelucid skin exactly of the shape of the
animal, after which it is as alert and vigorous as before. It appears from
hence that the leech breathes through the mouth; and, in fact, it has a motion
that seems to resemble the act of respiration in more perfect animals:
but concerning all this we are very much in the dark.</P>
<P>This animal seems to differ from all others in several
respects; the rest of the reptile tribe are brought forth from eggs; the
leech is vi∣viparous, and produces its young one after the other, to the number
of forty or fifty at a birth. It is probable that, like the snail, each
insect contains the two sexes, and that it im∣gregnates and is impregnated
in the same man∣ner. The young ones are chiefly found in the month of July,
in shallow running waters, and particularly where they are tepified by the
rays of the sun. The large ones are chiefly sought after; and being put
into a glass vessel <PB N="310" REF="319"/> filled with water, they remain
for months, nay for years, without taking any other subsistence. But they
never breed in this confinement; and, consequently, what regards that part of
their history still remains obscure.</P>
<P>In this part of the world they seldom grow to above four
inches; but in America and the East they are found from six to seven.
Their pools there abound with them in such numbers, that it would be
dangerous bathing there, if for no other consideration. Our sailors and
soldiers, who the last war were obliged to walk in those countries
through marshy grounds, talk with terror of the number of leeches that
infested them on their march. Even in some parts of Europe they encrease
so as to become formidable. Sedelius, a German physician, relates, that a
girl of nine years old, who was keeping sheep near the city of Bomst in
Poland, perceiving a soldier making up to her, went to hide herself in a
neighbouring marsh among some bushes; but the number of leeches was so
great in this place, and they stuck to her so close, that the poor
creature expired from the quantity of blood which she lost by their united
efforts. Nor is this much to be wondered at, since one of those insects
that when empty ge∣nerally weighs but a scruple, will, when gorged, weigh
more than two drachms.</P>
<P><PB N="311" REF="320"/>When leeches are to be applied, the
best way is to take them from the water in which they are contained about an
hour before, for they thus become more voracious and fasten more readily.
When saturated with blood, they generally fall off of themselves; but if it
be thought necessary to take them from the wound, care should be used
to pull them very gently, or even to sprinkle them with salt if they
continue to adhere; for if they be plucked rudely away, it most frequently
happens that they leave their teeth in the wound, which makes a very
troublesome inflammation, and is often attended with danger. If they be
slow in fixing to the part, they are often enticed by rubbing it with milk or
blood, or water mixed with sugar. As salt is a poison to most
insects, many people throw it upon the leech when it has dropped from the
wound, by which means it disgorges the blood it has swallowed, and it is
then kept for repeated application. They seldom, however, stick after this
operation; and as the price is but small, fresh leeches should always be
applied whenever such an ap∣plication is thought necessary.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. I. Of the second Order of Insects.</HEAD>
<P>IN the former part we gave a concise history of the most
considerable insects that, without wings, were produced in a perfect
state; either from the body of the parent alive, like qua∣drupedes, or from
the egg, in the manner of birds. We come now to a second order of insects,
that are produced from the egg, like the former, but not in a perfect state;
for when first excluded, they are without wings. This, however, does not
hinder the exercise of their animal functions; the insect, although not yet
come to perfection, walks, leaps, and eats; nor is it ever deprived of motion,
only that it rests a little when it is about to cast that part of its
skin previous to its state of perfection. It is then seen to assume
two wings, which, like a budding flower, burst through the case that
contained them, and the animal becomes a winged insect in its state of
highest perfection. To this order we may refer the Libella, or Dragon-Fly;
the Formica Leo, or Lion-Ant; the Grashopper; the Locust; the Cricket; the
Wood-Cricket; the Mole-Cricket; the Flea-Locust; the Flying-Bug; the Tipula;
the Water-Scorpion; the Notonecta, or Water-Fly, and many others.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="2" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="316" REF="323"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. II. Of the Libella or Dragon-Fly.</HEAD>
<P>OF all the flies which adorn or diversify the face of
Nature, these are the most various and the most beautiful; they are of
all colours; green, blue, crimson, scarlet, white; some unite a variety
of the most vivid tints, and ex∣hibit in one animal more different shades
than are to be found in the rainbow. They are called, in different parts of the
kingdom, by different names; but none can be at a loss to know them, as they
are distinguished from all other flies by the length of their bodies, by
the largeness of their eyes, and the beautiful trans∣parency of their
wings, which are four in number. They are seen in summer flying with great
rapidity near every hedge, and by every running brook; they sometimes
settle on the leaves of plants, and sometimes keep for hours together on
the wing.</P>
<P>Dragon-flies, though there are three or four different kinds,
yet agree in the most striking parts of their history, and one account
may serve for all. The largest sort are generally found from two to three
inches long; their tail <PB N="317" REF="324"/> is forked; their body divided
into eleven rings; their eyes are large, horny, and transparent, divided by a
number of intersections; and their wings, that always lie flat when they are
at rest, are of a beautiful glossy transparency; sometimes shining
like silver, and sometimes glistening like gold. Within the mouth are to
be seen two teeth covered with a beautiful lip: with these the creatures
bite fiercely when they are taken; but their bite is perfectly harmless, as I
have experienced more than once.</P>
<P>These insects, beautiful as they are, are pro∣duced from
eggs, which are deposited in the water, where they remain for some time
with∣out seeming life or motion. They are ejected by the female into the
water in clusters, like a bunch of grapes, where they sink to the bottom by
their natural weight, and continue in that state till the young ones find
strength enough to break the shell, and to separate from each other. The
form in which they first shew life is that of a worm with six legs,
bearing a strong resemblance to the dragon-fly in its winged state,
except that the wings are yet concealed within a sheath peculiar to this
ani∣mal. The rudiments of these appear in bunches on the back, within which
the wings are folded up into each other, while all the colours and 
<PB N="318" REF="325"/> varieties of painting appear transparent through the
skin. These animals, upon quitting the egg, still continue in the water,
where they creep and swim, but do not move swiftly. They have likewise a
sharp sight, and imme∣diately sink to the bottom, if any one comes to the
places wherein they live, or when∣ever they perceive the least uncommon
object. Their food at that time is soft mud and the glu∣tinous earthy
substances that are found at the bottom.</P>
<P>When these animals prepare to change from their reptile to
their flying state, they then move out of the water to a dry place; as into
grass; to pieces of wood, stone, or any thing else they meet with. They
there firmly fix their acute claws; and, for a short time, con∣tinue quite
immoveable, as if meditating on the change they are to undergo. It is then
observed, that the skin first opens on the head and back; and out of this
opening they exhibit their real head and eyes, and at length their six legs;
whilst, in the mean time, the hollow and empty skin, or slough of their
legs, remains firmly fixed in its place. After this, the enclosed creature
creeps forward by degrees; and by this means draws first its wings and then
its body out of the skin; and proceeding a little <PB N="319" REF="326"/>
farther, sits at rest for some time, as if im∣moveable. During this time,
the wings, which were moist and folded, begin by degrees to expand
themselves, and to make smooth and even all those plaits which were laid
against each other, like a closed fan. The body is likewise
insensibly extended, until all the limbs have obtained their proper size
and dimensions. All these surprizing and difficult operations are
accomplished by the force of the blood and the circulating humours. The
creature cannot at first make use of its new wings, and therefore is forced
to stay in the same place until all its limbs are dried by the
circumambient air. It soon, however, begins to enter upon a more noble life
than it had hitherto led in the bottom of the brook; and from creeping slowly
and living accidentally, it now wings the air, and makes choice from amidst
the variety of its provisions.</P>
<P>Indeed, no animal is more amply fitted for motion,
subsistence and enjoyment. As it haunts and seeks after its food flying
in the air, Nature has provided it with two large eyes, which make almost the
whole head, and which resemble glittering mother of pearl. It has also four
expansive silver-coloured wings, with which, as with oars, it can turn
itself with pro∣digious <PB N="318" REF="327"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/> <PB N="319" REF="328"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/> <PB REF="329"/> velocity; and to
assist these, it is fur∣nished with a very long body, which, like a
rudder, directs its motions. As the wings, are long, and the legs short, they
seldom walk, but are ever seen either resting or flying. For this
reason, they always chuse dry branches of trees or shrubs to remain on;
and when they have refreshed themselves a little, they renew their flight.
Thus they are seen adorning the summer with a profusion of beauty,
lightly traversing the air in a thousand direc∣tions, and expanding the
most beautiful colours to the sun. The garden, the forest, the hedges,
and the rivulets, are animated by their sports; and there are few who have
been brought up in the country, who have not employed a part of their childhood
in the pursuit.</P>
<P>But while these beautiful flies appear to us so idly and
innocently employed, they are in fact the greatest tyrants of the insect
tribe; and, like the hawk among birds, are only hovering up and down to seize
their prey. They are the strongest and the most courageous of all winged
insects; nor is there one, how large soever, that they will not attack and
devour. The blue fly, the bee, the wasp, and the hornet, make their
constant prey; and even the butterfly, that spreads so large a wing, is
often caught <PB N="321" REF="330"/> and treated without mercy. Their appetite
seems to know no bounds; they spend the whole day in the pursuit, and
have been seen to devour three times their own size in the cap∣ture of a
single hour. They seize their prey flying with their six claws, and tear
it easily to pieces with their teeth, which are capable of inflicting
troublesome wounds.</P>
<P>But the males are upon the wing for another purpose beside
that of food, as they are very salacious, and seek the females with great
ar∣dour. The sun no sooner begins to warm the fields, than the mates are
found assiduously employed each in seeking its mate; and no sooner
does a female appear, but two or three males are seen pursuing and
endeavouring to seize her with all their arts and agility. The instrument
of generation in the male is placed very different from that of any other
insect, being not at the end of the tail as in others, but immediately under
the breast, and conse∣quently, at first view, incapable of being united
to the sexual part of the female; which, as in other insects, lies in the
tail. To perform this junction, Nature has provided the male with a very
peculiar manner of proceeding. As soon as he perceives the female, and finds
him∣self sufficiently near, he seizes upon the back <PB N="322" REF="331"/> of her head by surprize, and fastening his claws upon her, turns
round his forky tail, which he fastens round her neck, and in this manner
fixes himself so closely and firmly, that no efforts can remove him. It
is in vain that she flies from one branch to another and settles upon them,
he still keeps fixed, and often continues in this situation for three or
four hours suc∣cessively. When he flies, she is obliged to fly with
him; but he still directs the way: and though she moves her wings, she
seems entirely guided by his motions. As yet, however, the business of
impregnation is not performed; for to this the female must contribute; and
she at last seems, by the continuance of her constraint, to comply:
for, turning up the end of her tail to that part of the breast of the male in
which lies the part proper for generation, both instruments meet, and the
eggs of the female receive the necessary fecundation. An hour or two after
this, she flies to some neigh∣bouring pool, where she deposites her
eggs, as was already mentioned. There they continue in a reptile state for a
year; and then are changed into a beautiful fly, resembling the parent.</P>

<DIV3 N="3" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="323" REF="332"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. III. Of the Formica Leo, or Lion-Ant.</HEAD>
<P>ALTHOUGH this animal properly belongs to no order of
insects, yet, as it is changed into a fly very much resembling that
described in the preceding chapter, it may not be improper to give its
history here. If we consider the life of this animal in its different
stages of existence, we shall find it equally wonderful in all; but as it
changes to a dragon-fly, what we have said of that animal above need not be
repeated here. The ant-lion, when it becomes an in∣habitant of air, in every
respect resembles that which has been already described; its glossy
wings, its voracious appetites, its peculiar manner of generation, are entirely
the same. It is in its reptile state that it differs from all other
insects; and in that state it will be amusing to pursue its
history.</P>
<P>The ant-lion, in its reptile state, is of the size of a
common wood-louse, but somewhat broader. It has a pretty long head and a
roundish body, which becomes a little narrower towards the tail. The colour
is a dirty grey, speckled with black, and the body is composed 
<PB N="324" REF="333"/> of several flat rings, which slip one upon ano∣ther.
It has six feet, four of which are fixed to the breast and two to the neck.
The head is small and flat, and before there are two little smooth horns or
feelers, which are hard, about a quarter of an inch long, and crooked at the
ends. At the basis of the feelers there are two small black lively eyes, by
which it can see the smallest object, as is easily discovered by its
starting from every thing that approaches.</P>
<P>To a form so unpromising, and so ill provided for the
purposes of rapacity, this animal unites the most ravenous appetites in
nature; but to mark its imbecillity still stronger, as other ani∣mals have
wings or feet to enable them to ad∣vance towards their prey, the ant-lion is
un∣provided with such assistance from either. It has legs indeed; but
these only enable it to run backward, so that it could as soon die as
make the smallest progressive motion. Thus, famished and rapacious as
it ever seems, its prey must come to it, or rather into the snare
provided for it, or the insidious assassin must starve.</P>
<P>But Nature, that has denied it strength or swiftness,
has given it an equivalent in cunning, so that no animal fares more
sumptuously, with∣out ever stirring from its retreat. For this 
<PB N="325" REF="334"/> purpose, it chuses a dry sandy place, at the foot
of a wall, or under some shelter, in order to preserve its machinations
from the rain. The driest and most sandy spot is the most proper for
it; because a heavy clogged earth would defeat its labour. When it goes about
to dig the hole where it takes its prey, it begins to bend the hinder part of
its body, which is pointed, and thus works backward; making, after several
attempts, a circular fur∣row, which serves to mark out the size of the hole
it intends making, as the ancients marked out the limits of a city with the
plough. Within this first furrow it digs a second; then a third; and
afterwards others, which are always less than the preceding. Then it begins
to deepen its hole, sinking lower and lower into the sand, which it throws
with its horns, or feelers, to∣wards the edges, as we see men throw up sand
in a gravel-pit. Thus, by repeating its labours all round, the sand is thrown
up in a circle about the edge of the pit, until the whole is quite compleated.
This hole is always formed in a perfect circle; and the pit itself
resembles the inside of an inverted funnel. When this insect first
leaves the egg and is newly hatched, the first pit it makes is very small;
but as it grows bigger, it makes a larger hole; which <PB N="326" REF="335"/> is
destined, like a pit-fall, to entrap its prey. It is generally about two
inches deep, and as much in diameter.</P>
<P>The work being thus with great labour finished, the
insidious insect places itself in ambush, hiding itself at the bottom
under the sand in such a manner, that its two horns encircle the bottom of
the pit. All the sides of this pit-fall are made of the most loose and
crumbling materials; so that scarce any insect can climb up that has once
got down to the bottom. Conscious of this, the ant-lion re∣mains in patient
expectation, ready to profit by that accident which throws some heedless
little animal into its den. If then, by misfor∣tune, an ant, a wood-louse, or
a small cater∣pillar walks too near the edge of the precipice, the sand
gives way beneath them, and they fall to the bottom of the pit, where they meet
inevitable destruction. The fall of a single grain of sand gives the
murderer notice at the bottom of its cave; and it never fails to sally forth
to seize upon its prey. It happens some∣times, however, that the ant or the
wood-louse is too nimble, and runs up the sides of the pit∣fall before the
other can make ready to seize it. The ant-lion has then another contrivance,
still more wonderful than the former; for, by means <PB N="327" REF="336"/> of
its broad head and feelers, it has a method of throwing up a shower of sand
which falls upon the struggling captive with tremendous weight, and once more
crushes it down to the bottom. When the insect is once fallen thus low, no
efforts can retrieve or release it; the ant-lion seizes it with its
feelers, which are hollow, and darting them both into its body, sucks out all
the little animal's juices with the utmost rapacity.</P>
<P>When the prey is thus reduced to a husk, and nothing but the
external form remains, the next care of the murderer is to remove the body from
its cell; since the appearance of dead car∣cases might forewarn other
insects of the danger of the place. The insect, therefore, takes up the
wasted trunk with its feelers, and throws it, with wonderful strength, at
least six inches from the edge of its hole; and then patiently sets about
mending the breaches which its forti∣fications had received in the last
engagement. Nothing can abate its industry, its vigilance, its patience, or
its rapacity. It will work for a week together to make its pit-fall; it will
continue upon the watch for more than a month, pa∣tiently expecting the
approach of its prey; and if it comes in greater quantities than is needful,
yet still the little voracious creature will quit the <PB N="328" REF="337"/>
insect it has newly killed, and leave it half eaten, to kill and attack any
other that happens to fall within the sphere of its malignity: yet, though
so voracious, it is surprizingly patient of hunger; some of them having
been kept in a box with sand for six months and upwards, without feeding at
all.</P>
<P>When the ant-lion attains a certain age, in which it is to
change into another form, it then leaves off its usual rapacious habits, but
keeps on its industry. It no longer continues to make pits, but furrows up
the sand all round in an irregular manner; testifying those work∣ings and
violent agitations which most insects exhibit previous to their
transformation. These animals are produced in autumn, and generally live a
year, and perhaps two, before they assume a winged form. Certain it is,
that they are found at the end of winter of all sizes; and it would seem
that many of the smaller kinds had not yet attained sufficient maturity for
trans∣formation. Be this as it may, when the time of change approaches, if
the insect finds its little cell convenient, it seeks no other: if it is
obliged to remove, after furrowing up the sand, it hides itself under it,
horns and all. It there spins a thread, in the manner of the spider; which
being made of a glutinous substance, and being humid <PB N="329" REF="338"/>
from the moisture of its body, sticks to the little particles of sand
among which it is spun; and in proportion as it is thus excluded, the
insect rolls up its web, sand and all, into a ball, of which itself is
the center. This ball is about half an inch in diameter; and within it the
insect re∣sides, in an apartment sufficiently spacious for all its
motions. The outside is composed of sand and silk; the inside is
lined with silk only, of a fine pearl colour, extremely delicate, and
perfectly beautiful. But though the work is so curious within, it exhibits
nothing to external appearance, but a lump of sand; and thus escapes the
search of birds, that might otherwise disturb the inhabitant within.</P>
<P>The insect continues thus shut up for six weeks or two
months; and gradually parts with its eyes, its feelers, its feet, and its
skin; all which are thrust into a corner of the inner apart∣ment, like a
rag. The insect then appears almost in its winged state, except that
there is a thin skin which wraps up the wings, and that appears to be nothing
else but a liquor dried on their outside. Still, however, the little animal
is too delicate and tender to venture from its retreat; but continues
enclosed for some time longer: at length, when the members of this new
insect have acquired the necessary con∣sistence <PB N="330" REF="339"/> and vigour, it tears open its lodging, and breaks through its wall.
For this purpose it has two teeth, like those of grashoppers, with which
it eats through, and enlarges the opening, till it gets out. Its body, which is
turned like a screw, takes up no more than the space of a quarter of an
inch; but when it is unfolded, it becomes half an inch in length; while its
wings, that seemed to occupy the smallest space, in two minutes time
unfold, and become longer than the body. In short, it becomes a large and
beautiful fly of the libellula kind, with a long, slender body, of a brown
colour; a small head, with large bright eyes, long slender legs, and four
large transparent, reticulated wings. The rest of its habits resemble
that insect whose form it bears; except, that instead of dropping its
eggs in the water, it deposites them in sand, where they are soon hatched
into that rapacious insect so justly admired for its method of catch∣ing
its prey.</P>

<PB N="331" REF="340"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. IV. Of the Grasshopper, the Locust, the Cicada,
the Cricket, and the Mole Cricket.</HEAD>
<P>BELONGING to the second order of insects, we find a tribe
of little animals, which, though differing in size and colour, strongly
resemble each other in figure, appetites, nature, and transformation. But
though they all appear of one family, yet man has been taught to hold them in
different estimation; for while some of this tribe amuse him with their
chirpings, and banish solitude from the fields, others come in swarms,
eat up every thing that is green, and in a single night convert the most
delightful landscape into a dreary waste. However, if these animals be
separately considered, the de∣vouring locust is not in the least more
mis∣chievous than the musical grasshopper; the only difference is, that
one species come for food in a swarm, the other feeds singly.</P>
<P>That animal which is called the grasshopper with us, differs
greatly from the cicada of an∣tiquity; for as our insect is active enough in
hopping through the long grass, from whence it has taken its name, the cicada
had not this <PB N="332" REF="341"/> power, but either walked or flew. The
little hissing note also of our grasshopper is very dif∣ferent from the
song of the cicada, which was louder and far more musical. The manner in
which this note is produced by the two animals is very different; for the
cicada makes it by a kind of buckler, which the male has beneath its belly; the
grasshopper by a transparent membrane that covers an hole at the base of
its wings. There is still a greater variety in all these with regard to
shape and colour. Some are green, some black, some livid, and some
variegated; but many of them do not shew all their colours till they fly.
Some have long legs, some short; some with more joints, others with
fewer. Some sing, others are mute; some are innocent, doing no damage to
the husband∣man; while others do such prodigious mischief, that they are
looked upon in some countries as one of the terrible scourges of the
incensed Divinity.</P>
<P>Of this variegated tribe, the little grasshopper that breeds
in such plenty in every meadow, and that continues its chirping through the
summer, is best known to us; and by having its history we shall be
possessed of that of all the rest. This animal is of the colour of
green leaves, except a line of brown which streaks <PB N="333" REF="342"/> the
back, and two pale lines under the belly and behind the legs. It may be divided
into the head, the corslet, and the belly. The head is oblong, regarding the
earth, and bearing some resemblance to that of a horse. Its mouth is
covered by a kind of round buckler jutting over it, and armed with teeth of a
brown co∣lour, hooked at the points. Within the mouth is perceivable a large
reddish tongue, and fixed to the lower jaw. The feelers or horns are very
long, tapering off to a point; and the eyes are like two black specks, a
little prominent. The corslet is elevated, narrow, armed above and below, by
two serrated spines. The back is armed with a strong buckler, to which
the muscles of the legs are firmly bound, and round these muscles are
seen the vessels by which the animal breathes, as white as snow. The
last pair of legs are much longer and stronger than the first two pair,
fortified by thick muscles, and very well formed for leaping. It has four
wings; the anterior ones springing from the second pair of legs, the
posterior from the third pair The hinder wings are much finer and more
expansive than the foremost, and are the principal instruments of its
flight. The belly is considerably large, composed of eight rings, and
terminated by a forky tail, covered with <PB N="334" REF="343"/> down, like the
tail of a rat. When examined internally, besides the gullet, we discover a
small stomach; and behind that a very large one, wrinkled and furrowed
within side: lower down there is still a third; so that it is not without
reason that all the animals of this order are said to chew the cud, as they
so much resemble rumi∣nant animals in their internal conformation.</P>
<P>A short time after the grasshopper assumes its wings,
it fills the meadow with its note; which, like that among birds, is a call to
court∣ship. The male only of this tribe is vocal; and, upon examining at the
base of the wings, there will be found a little hole in its body, covered
with a fine transparent membrane. This is thought, by Linnaeus, to be the
instrument it employs in singing; but others are of opinion the sound is
produced by rubbing its hinder legs against each other: however this be, the
note of one male is seldom heard, but it is re∣turned by another; and the two
little animals, after many mutual insults of this kind, are seen to meet
and fight desperately. The female is generally the reward of victory; for,
after the combat, the male seizes her with his teeth behind the neck, and
thus keeps her for several hours, till the business of fecundation is
per∣formed. They are at that time so strongly <PB N="335" REF="344"/>
united, that they can scarcely be separated with∣out tearing asunder.
Towards the latter end of autumn the female prepares to deposite her burthen;
and her body is then seen greatly distended with her eggs, which she
carries to the number of an hundred and fifty. In order to make a proper
lodgement in the earth for them, Nature has furnished her with an
instrument at her tail, somewhat resembling a two-edged sword, which
she can sheathe and unsheathe at pleasure: with this she pierces the
earth as deep as she is able; and into the hole which her instrument has
made, she deposites her eggs, one after the other.</P>
<P>Having thus provided for the continuation of her posterity,
the animal herself does not long survive; but, as the winter approaches,
she dries up, seems to feel the effects of age, and dies from a total
decay. Some, however, assert, that she is killed by the cold; and others,
that she is eaten by worms: but certain it is, that neither the male nor
female are ever seen to survive the winter. In the mean time the eggs which
have been deposited, continue unaltered, either by the severity of the
season, or the retardation of the spring. They are of an oval figure,
white, and of the consistence of horn: their size nearly equals that of a
grain of anise: they are enve∣loped <PB N="336" REF="345"/> in the body within
a covering, branched all over with veins and arteries; and when ex∣cluded, they
crack, on being pressed between the fingers: their substance within is
a whitish, viscous and transparent fluid. In this manner they remain
deposited beneath the surface of the earth, during the whole winter; till
the genial return of spring begins to vivify and hatch them. The sun, with
its warmth, beginning to animate all nature, the insect eggs feel its benign
influence; and generally, about the beginning of May, every egg produces an
insect, about the size of a flea. These at first are of a whitish
colour; at the end of two or three days they turn black; and soon after they
become of a reddish brown. They appear, from the be∣ginning, like
grasshoppers wanting wings; and hop among the grass, as soon as excluded,
with great agility.</P>
<P>Yet still they are by no means arrived at their state of
full perfection; although they bear a strong resemblance to the animal in
its perfect form. They want, or seem to want the wings, which they are at
last seen to assume; and can only hop among the grass, without being
able to fly. The wings, however, are not wanting, but are concealed within four
little bunches, that seem to deform the sides of the animal: 
<PB N="337" REF="346"/> there they lie rolled up in a most curious manner; and
occupying a smaller space than one could conceive who saw them extended.
Indeed, all insects, whatever transmutations they seem to undergo, are
yet brought forth with those very limbs, parts and wings, which they
afterwards seem to acquire. In the most helpless cater∣pillar, there is
still to be seen the rudiments of that beautiful plumage which it
afterwards ex∣pands when a butterfly; and though many new parts seem unfolded
to the view, the animal acquires none but such as it was from the be∣ginning
possessed of. The grasshopper, there∣fore, though seemingly without
wings, is in reality, from the first, possessed of those
instru∣ments, and only waits for sufficient force to break the bonds that
hold them folded up, and to give them their full expansion.</P>
<P>The grasshopper, that for above twenty days from its
exclusion has continued without the use of its wings, which were folded up
to its body, at length prepares for its emancipation, and for a life of greater
liberty and pleasure. To make the proper dispositions for the
ap∣proaching change, it ceases from its grassy food, and seeks about
for a convenient place, beneath some thorn or thistle, that may protect it
from an accidental shower. The same laborious <PB N="338" REF="347"/>
writhings and workings, heavings and palpi∣tations, which we have remarked in
every other insect upon an approaching change, are ex∣hibited in this. It
swells up its head and neck; it then seems to draw them in again; and thus
alternately, for some time, it exerts its powers to get free. At length, the
skin covering the head and breast is seen dividing above the neck; the
head is seen issuing out first from the bursting skin; the efforts
still continuing, the other parts follow successively; so that the
little animal, with its long feelers, legs and all, works its way from the old
skin, that re∣mains fixed to the thistle or the thorn. It is, indeed,
inconceivable how the insect can thus extricate itself from so exact a
sheath as that which covered every part of its body.</P>
<P>The grasshopper, thus disengaged from its outer skin,
appears in its perfect form; but then so feeble, and its body so soft and
tender, that it may be molded like wax. It is no longer of that obscure
colour which it exhibited before, but a greenish white, which becomes more
vivid as the moisture on the surface is dried away. Still, however, the
animal con∣tinues to shew no signs of life, but appears quite spent and
fatigued with its labour for more than an hour together. During this time, 
<PB N="339" REF="348"/> the body is drying, and the wings unfolding to their
greatest expansion, and the curious observer will perceive them, fold
after fold, opening to the sun, till at last they become longer than the
two hinder legs. The insect's body also is lengthened during this
operation, and it becomes much more beautiful than before.</P>
<P>These insects are generally vocal in the midst of
summer; and they are heard at sun∣setting much louder than during the
heats of the day. They are fed upon grass; and, if their belly be
pressed, they will be seen to re∣turn the juices of the plants they have
last fed upon. Though unwilling to fly, and slow in flight, particularly
when the weather is moist or cool, they are sometimes seen to fly to
con∣siderable distances. If they are caught by one of the hinder legs, they
quickly disengage themselves from it, and leave the leg behind them. This,
however, does not grow again, as with crabs or spiders; for as they are
animals but of a single year's continuance, they have not sufficient time
for repairing those accidental misfortunes. The loss of their leg also
prevents them from flying; for, being unable to lift themselves in the air,
they have not room upon the ground for the proper expansion of their 
<PB N="340" REF="349"/> wings. If they be handled roughly, they will bite very
fiercely; and when they fly, they make a noise with their wings. They
generally keep in the plain, where the grass is luxuriant, and the ground
rich and fertile: there they deposite their eggs, particularly in those
cracks which are formed by the heat of the sun.</P>
<P>Such are the habits and nature of those little vocal
insects, that swarm in our meadows, and enliven the landscape. The larger
kinds only differ from them in size, in rapidity of flight, and the powers of
injuring mankind, by swarm∣ing upon the productions of the earth. The
quantity of grass which a few grasshoppers that sport in the fields can
destroy is trifling; but when a swarm of locusts, two or three miles
long, and several yards deep, settle upon a field, the consequences are
frightful. The annals of every country are marked with the devastation which
such a multitude of insects produces; and though they seldom visit
Europe in such dangerous swarms as formerly, yet, in some of the
southern kingdoms, they are still formidable. Those which have at
uncertain in∣tervals visited Europe, in our memory, are sup∣posed to have
come from Africa, and the animal is called the Great Brown Locust. It was
seen in several parts of England in the year 1748, and 
<PB N="341" REF="350"/> many dreadful consequences were apprehended from its
appearance. This insect is about three inches long; and has two horns or
feelers, an inch in length. The head and horns are of a brownish colour; it
is blue about the mouth, as also on the inside of the larger legs. The
shield that covers the back is greenish; and the upper side of the body
brown, spotted with black, and the under side purple. The upper wings are
brown, with small dusky spots, with one larger at the tips; the under
wings are more transparent, and of a light brown, tinctured with green, but
there is a dark cloud of spots near the tips. This is that insect that has
threatened us so often with its visitations; and that is so truly
terrible in the countries where it is bred. There is no animal in the creation
that multiplies so fast as these, if the sun be warm, and the soil in
which their eggs are deposited be dry. Happily for us, the coldness of our
climate, and the humidity of our soil, are no way favourable to their
pro∣duction; and as they are but the animals of a year, they visit us and
perish.</P>
<P>The Scripture, which was written in a country where the
locust made a distinguished feature in the picture of Nature, has given
us several very striking images of this animal's numbers 
<PB N="342" REF="351"/> and rapacity. It compares an army, where the numbers are
almost infinite, to a swarm of lo∣custs: it describes them as rising
out of the earth, where they are produced; as pursuing a settled march to
destroy the fruits of the earth, and co-operate with divine indignation.</P>
<P>When the locusts take the field, as we are assured, they
have a leader at their head, whose flight they observe, and pay a strict
attention to all his motions. They appear, at a distance, like a black cloud,
which, as it approaches, gathers upon the horizon, and almost hides the light
of the day. It often happens that the husbandman sees this imminent
calamity pass away without doing him any mischief; and the whole swarm
proceed onward, to settle upon the labours of some less fortunate
country. But wretched is the district upon which they settle: they ravage
the meadow and the pasture ground; strip the trees of their leaves, and the
garden of its beauty: the visitation of a few minutes de∣stroys the
expectations of a year; and a famine but too frequently ensues. In their
native tro∣pical climates they are not so dreadful as in the more southern
parts of Europe. There, though the plain and the forest be stripped of
their ver∣dure, the power of vegetation is so great, that an interval of
three or four days repairs the <PB N="343" REF="352"/> calamity: but our verdure
is the livery of a season; and we must wait till the ensuing spring
repairs the damage. Besides, in their long flights to this part of the world,
they are fa∣mished by the tediousness of their journey, and are therefore
more voracious wherever they happen to settle. But it is not by what they
devour that they do so much damage as by what they destroy. Their very bite
is thought to contaminate the plant, and to prevent its vegetation. To use
the expression of the husbandman, they burn whatever they touch; and
leave the marks of their devastation for two or three years ensuing. But if
they be noxious while living, they are still more so when dead; for
wherever they fall, they infect the air in such a manner that the smell is
in∣supportable. Orosius tells us, that in the year of the world 3800, there
was an incredible number of locusts which infected Africa; and, after having
eaten up every thing that was green, they flew off and were drowned in the
African sea; where they caused such a stench, that the putrefying
bodies of hundreds of thousands of men could not equal it.</P>
<P>In the year 1690, a cloud of locusts was seen to enter
Russia in three different places; and from thence to spread themselves
over <PB N="344" REF="353"/> Poland and Lithuania, in such astonishing
mul∣titudes, that the air was darkened, and the earth covered with their
numbers. In some places they were seen lying dead, heaped upon each other
four feet deep; in others, they covered the surface like a black cloth: the
trees bent beneath their weight; and the da∣mage which the country
sustained exceeded computation. In Barbary their numbers are formidable,
and their visits are frequent. In the year 1724, Doctor Shaw was a witness
in that country of their devastations. Their first appearance was about the
latter end of March, when the wind had been southerly for some time. In the
beginning of April, their numbers were so vastly encreased, that in the
heat of the day they formed themselves into large swarms, which appeared
like clouds, and darkened the sun. In the middle of May they began to
disappear, retiring into the plains to deposit their eggs. In the next
month, being June, the young brood began to make their appear∣ance, forming
many compact bodies of several hundred yards square; which afterwards
march∣ing forward, climbed the trees, walls, and houses, eating every thing
that was green in their way. The inhabitants, to stop their pro∣gress, laid
trenches all over their fields and <PB N="345" REF="354"/> gardens, filling them
with water. Some placed large quantities of heath, stubble, and such like
combustible matter, in rows, and set them on fire on the approach of the
locusts. But all this was to no purpose; for the trenches were quickly
filled up, and the fires put out by the vast number of swarms that
succeeded each other. A day or two after one of these was in motion, others
that were just hatched came to glean after them, gnawing off the young
branches and the very bark of the trees. Having lived near a month in this
manner, they arrived at their full growth, and threw off their worm-like
state, by casting their skins. To prepare themselves for this change,
they fixed their hinder feet to some bush or twig, or corner of a stone,
when immediately, by an undulating motion used on this occasion, their
heads would first appear, and soon after the rest of their bodies. The
whole transformation was per∣formed in seven or eight minutes time; after
which, they were a little while in a languishing condition; but as soon as
the sun and air had hardened their wings, and dried up the moisture that
remained after casting off their sloughs, they returned again to their
former greediness, with an addition both of strength and agility. But they
did not continue long in this state <PB N="346" REF="355"/> before they were
entirely dispersed; after laying their eggs, directing their course
northward, and probably perished in the sea. It is said that the holes
these animals make, to deposite their eggs, are four feet deep in the
ground; where the eggs are deposited, about fourscore in number, of the
size of caraway comfits, and bundled up together in clusters.</P>
<P>It would be endless to recount all the mis∣chiefs which
these famished insects have at dif∣ferent times occasioned; but what
can have in∣duced them to take such distant flights, when they come into
Europe, is not so easy to be accounted for. It seems most probable,
that by means of a very dry season in the heart of Africa, they are
propagated in such numbers, that the vegetables of the spot where they are
produced are not sufficient to sustain them. Thus being obliged to find
out other countries, they traverse the sandy deserts, where they can find
no sustenance; still meeting with nothing to allure them from their
height, they proceed forward across the sea, and thus come into Eu∣rope,
where they alight upon the first green pastures that occur.</P>
<P>In some parts of the world, the inhabitants turn what
seems a plague to their own advan∣tage. Locusts are eaten by the natives in
many <PB N="347" REF="356"/> kingdoms of the east; and are caught in small
nets provided for that purpose. They parch them over the fire in an earthen
pan; and when their wings and legs are fallen off, they turn reddish, of the
colour of boiled shrimps. Dampier has eat them thus prepared, and thinks them
a tolerable dish. The natives of Barbary also eat them fried with salt;
and they are said to taste like cray-fish.</P>
<P>There is a locust in Tonquin, about the bigness of the top
of a man's finger, and as long as the first joint. It breeds in the earth, in
low grounds; and in the months of January and February, which is the season
for taking them, they issue from the earth in vast swarms. At first
they can hardly fly, so that they often fall into the rivers in great
numbers: however, the natives in these months watch the rivers, and take them
up in multitudes in small nets. They either eat them fresh, broiled on the
coals, or pickle them for keeping. They are considered as a great delicacy in
that part of the world, as well by the rich as the poor. In the countries where
they are eaten, they are regularly brought to market, and sold as larks or
quails in Europe. They must have been a common food with the Jews, as
Moses, in the book of Leviticus, permits them to eat <PB N="348" REF="357"/>
four different kinds of this animal, which he takes care to specify. This
dish, however, has not yet made its way into the kitchens of the luxurious in
Europe; and though we may ad∣mire the delicacies of the east, we are as yet
happily deprived of the powers of imitation.</P>
<P>Of all animals, however, of this noxious tribe, the Great
West-Indian Locust, indi∣vidually considered, is the most formidable.
It is about the thickness of the barrel of a goose-quill, and the body is
divided into nine or ten joints, in the whole about six or seven inches
long. It has two small eyes, standing out of the head like those of
crabs, and two feelers like long hair. The whole body is studded with small
excrescences, which are not much bigger than the points of pins. The shape
is roundish, and the body diminishes in circumference to the tail, which is
forked into two horns. Between these, there is a sort of a sheath
containing a small dangerous sting. If any person happens to touch this
insect he is sure to be stung; and is immediately taken with a
shivering and trembling all over the body; which, however, may soon be put
a stop to, by rubbing the place that was affected with a little palm oil.</P>
<P>From the locust we descend to the cricket, 
<PB N="349" REF="358"/> which is a very inoffensive and pretty animal. Though
there be a species of this insect that lives entirely in the woods and
fields, yet that with which we are best acquainted is the House-cricket,
whose voice is so well known behind a country fire in a winter's evening.
There is something so unusual in hearing a sound while we do not see
the animal producing it, nor discover the place from whence it comes, that
among the country people the chirping of the cricket is always held ominous;
and whether it deserts the fire-side, or pays an unexpected visit, the
credulous peasantry always find some∣thing to be afraid of. In general,
however, the killing of a cricket is considered as a most unlucky omen; and
though their company is not much desired, yet no methods must be taken to
remove them.</P>
<P>The cricket very much resembles the grass∣hopper in its
shape, its manner of ruminating, its voice, its leaping, and methods of
propa∣gation. It differs in its colour, which is uni∣formly of a rusty brown;
in its food, which is more various; and in its place of residence, which is
most usually in the warmest chinks behind a country hearth. They are, in
some measure, obliged to the bad masonry employed in making peasants
houses for their retreats. <PB N="350" REF="359"/> The smallest chink
serves to give them shelter; and where they once make their abode they are
sure to propagate. They are of a most chilly nature, seldom leaving the
fire-side; and, if undisturbed, are seen to hop from their retreats to
chirrup at the blaze in the chimney. The wood-cricket is the most timorous
animal in nature; but the chimney-cricket, being used to noises,
disregards not only those, but the appearance of people near it. Whether
the voice of this animal is formed in the same manner with that of the
grasshopper, by a fine membrane at the base of the wings, which is moved by
a muscle, and which being coiled up, gives a sound like a quail-pipe is not
yet ascertained; nor do we well know the use of this voice, since
anatomical inspection has not yet been able to discover the smallest
organs of hearing. Still, however, we can make no doubt of their power of
distinguishing sounds, though probably not in the same manner with the
more perfect ranks of nature. Certain it is that I have often heard them call,
and this call was as re∣gularly answered by another, although none but the
males are vocal.</P>
<P>As the cricket lives chiefly in the dark, so its eyes seem
formed for the gloominess of its abode; and those who would surprize it,
have <PB N="351" REF="360"/> only to light a candle unexpectedly; by which it is
dazzled, and cannot find the way back to its retreat. It is a very voracious
little animal, and will eat bread, flower, and meat; but it is particularly
fond of sugar. They never drink, but keep for months together at the back of
the chimney, where they could possibly have had no moisture. The warmth
of their situation only serves to encrease their mirth and loquacity.
Except in the very coldest weather, they never cease their chirruping, but
continue that little piercing note, which is as pleasing to some as it is
disagreeable to others. The great Scaliger was particularly delighted with
the chirruping of crickets, and kept several of them for his amusement,
en∣closed in a box, which he placed in a warm situation. Others, on the
contrary, think there is something ominous and melancholly in the sound,
and use every endeavour to banish this insect from their houses.
Ledelius tells us of a woman who was very much incommoded by crickets, and
tried, but in vain, every method of banishing them from her house. She at
last accidentally succeeded; for having one day in∣vited several guests
to her house, where there was a wedding, in order to encrease the
festivity of the entertainment, she procured drums and 
<PB N="352" REF="361"/> trumpets to entertain them. The noise of these was
so much greater than what the little animals were used to, that they
instantly for∣sook their situation, and were never heard in that
mansion more.</P>
<P>But of all the cricket kind, that which is called the
Mole-Cricket is the most extraor∣dinary. This animal is the largest of all
the insects with which we are acquainted in this country, being two inches
and an half in length, and three quarters of an inch in breadth. The colour is
of a dusky brown; and at the extre∣mity of the tail there are two hairy
excrescences, resembling in some sense the tail of a mouse. The
body consists of eightscaly joints or separate folds, is brown on the
upper part, and more deeply tinged below. The wings are long, narrow, and
terminate in a sharp point, each having a blackish line running down it:
how∣ever, when they are extended, they appear to be much broader than could at
first sight be sup∣posed. The shield of the breast is of a firm
texture, of a blackish colour and hairy. The fore-feet, which are this
animal's principal in∣struments of burrowing into the earth, are strong,
webbed, and hairy; it generally, how∣ever, runs backward; but it is commonly
under ground, where it burrows even faster than a <PB N="353" REF="362"/>
mole. It is thought also to be amphibious; and capable of living under water,
as well as under ground.</P>
<P>Of all insects this is the most detested by gardeners,
as it chiefly resides in that ground which lies light, and where it finds
sufficient plenty under the surface. Thus, in a single night's time, it
will run along a furrow which has been newly sown, and rob it of all its
con∣tents. Its legs are formed in such a manner that it can penetrate the
earth in every di∣rection; before, behind, and above it. At night it ventures
from its underground habitation, and, like the cricket, has its chirping call.
When the female is fecundated, she makes a cell of clammy earth, the inside
of which is large enough to hold two hazle-nuts; and in this she lays her
eggs. The whole nest is about the size of a common hen's egg, closed up
on every side, and well defended from the smallest breath of air. The
eggs generally amount to the num∣ber of an hundred and fifty, being white, and
about the size of a carraway comfit. They are thus carefully covered, as well
to defend them from the injuries of the weather, as from the attacks of the
black-beetle; that being itself an underground inhabitant, would, but for
this precaution, devour or destroy them. To prevent <PB N="354" REF="363"/>
this, the female mole cricket is often posted as a centinel near the nest,
and when the black invader plunges in to seize its prey, the guar∣dian
insect seizes him behind, and instantly bites him in two.</P>
<P>Nothing can exceed the care and assiduity which these
animals exhibit in the preservation of their young. Wherever the nest is
placed, there seems to be a fortification, avenues and entrenchments, drawn
round it: there are num∣berless winding ways that lead to it, and a ditch
drawn about it, which few of its insect enemies are able to pass. But their
care is not confined to this only; for at the approach of winter they carry
their nest entirely away, and sink it deeper in the ground, so that the
frost can have no in∣fluence in retarding the young brood from coming to
maturity. As the weather grows milder, they raise their magazines in
propor∣tion; till, at last, they bring it as near the surface as they can,
to receive the genial in∣fluence of the sun, without wholly exposing it to
view: yet, should the frost unexpectedly re∣turn, they sink it agin as
before.</P>

<DIV3 N="5" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="355" REF="364"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. V. Of the Earwig, the Froth Insect, and some
others belonging to the second Order of Insects.</HEAD>
<P>WE should still keep in memory that all insects of the
second order, though not pro∣duced quite perfect from the egg, yet want very
little of their perfection, and require but a very small change to arrive at
that state which fits them for flight and generation. The natural functions
in these are never suspended: from the instant they leave the egg, they
continue to eat, to move, to leap, and pursue their prey: a slight change
ensues; a skin that enclosed a part of their body and limbs, bursts
behind, like a woman's stays, and gives freedom to a set of wings, with
which the animal expatiates, and flies in pursuit of its mate.</P>
<P>Of all this class of insects, the earwig under∣goes the
smallest change. This animal is so common, that it scarce needs a
description: its swiftness in the reptile state is not less
remark∣able than its indefatigable velocity when upon the wing. That it must
be very prolific, appears from its numbers; and that it is very harmless, 
<PB N="356" REF="365"/> every one's experience can readily testify. It is
provided with six feet, and two feelers: the tail is forked; and with this it
often attempts to de∣fend itself against every assailant. But its
at∣tempts are only the threats of impotence; they draw down the resentment of
powerful animals, but no way serve to defend it. The deformity of its figure,
and its slender make, have also sub∣jected it to an imputation, which,
though en∣tirely founded in prejudice, has more than once procured its
destruction. It is supposed, as the name imports, that it often enters
into the ears of people sleeping; thus causing madness, from the
intolerable pain, and soon after death itself. Indeed, the French name,
which signifies the Ear-piercer, urges the calumny against this harmless
insect, in very plain terms: yet nothing can be more unjust; the ear is
already filled with a substance which prevents any insect from en∣tering;
and besides, it is well lined and defended with membranes, which would keep
out any little animal, even though the ear-wax were away. These reproaches,
therefore, are entirely groundless: but it were well if the accusations
which gardeners bring against the earwig, were as slightly founded. There
is nothing more certain than that it lives among flowers, and destroys them.
When fruit also has been <PB N="357" REF="366"/> wounded by flies, the earwig
generally comes in for a second feast, and sucks those juices which
they first began to broach. Still, however, this insect is not so noxious
as it would seem; and seldom is found but where the mischief has been
originally begun by others. Like all of this class, the earwig is hatched
from an egg. As there are various kinds of this animal, so they chuse
different places to breed in: in general, however, they lay their eggs under
the bark of plants, or in the clefts of trees, when beginning to decay. They
proceed from the egg in that reptile state in which they are most commonly
seen; and, as they grow larger, the wings bound under the skin begin to
burgeon. It is amazing how very little room four large wings take up before
they are protruded; for no person could ever conceive such an expansion
of natural drapery could be rolled up in so small a pacquet. The sheath
in which they are enveloped, folds and covers them so neatly, that the animal
seems quite destitute of wings<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Swammerdam, p.
114.</BIBL></NOTE>; and even when they are burst from their confinement, the
animal, by the power of the muscles and joints which it has in the middle of
its wings, can closely fold them into a very narrow compass. When the
earwig has become a winged insect, it flies in <PB N="358" REF="367"/>
pursuit of the female, ceasing to feed, and is wholly employed in the
business of propagation. It lives, in its winged state, but a few days;
and having taken care for the continuance of posterity, dries up, and dies,
to all appearance consumptive.</P>
<P>To this order of insects we may also refer the Cuckow
Spit, or Froth Worm, that is often found hid in that frothy matter which we
find on the surface of plants. It has an oblong, ob∣tuse body; and a large
head, with small eyes. The external wings, for it has four, are of a dusky
brown colour, marked with two white spots: the head is black. The spume in
which it is found wallowing, is all of its own for∣mation, and very much
resembles frothy spittle. It proceeds from the vent of the animal, and
other parts of the body; and if it be wiped away, a new quantity will be
quickly seen ejected from the little animal's body. Within this spume it is
seen in time to acquire four tu∣bercles on its back, wherein the wings are
en∣closed: these bursting from a reptile, it becomes a winged animal; and
thus rendered perfect, it flies to meet its mate, and propagate its kind.</P>
<P>The Water Tipula also belongs to this class. It has an
oblong slender body, with four feet fixed upon the breast, and four feelers
near the <PB N="359" REF="368"/> mouth. It has four weak wings, which do not at
all seem proper for flying, but leaping only. But what this insect chiefly
demands our at∣tention for is, the wonderful lightness where∣with it runs on
the surface of the water, so as scarcely to put it in motion. It is
sometimes seen in rivers, and on their banks, especially under shady
trees; and generally in swarms of several together.</P>
<P>The Common Water-Flie also breeds in the same manner with
those above-mentioned. This animal is by some called the Notonecta,
because it does not swim, in the usual manner, upon its belly, but on its
back: nor can we help ad∣miring that fitness in this insect for its
situation, as it feeds on the under-side of plants which grow on the
surface of the water; and therefore it is thus formed with its mouth upwards,
to take its food with greater convenience and ease.</P>
<P>We may also add the Water-Scorpion, which is a large
insect, being near an inch in length, and about half an inch in breadth. Its
body is nearly oval, but very flat and thin; and its tail long and pointed. The
head is small; and the feelers appear like legs, resembling the claws of a
scorpion, but without sharp points. This insect is generally found in
ponds; and is, of all others, the most tyrannical and rapacious. 
<PB N="360" REF="369"/> It destroys, like a wolf among sheep, twenty times
as many as its hunger requires. One of these, when put into a bason of
water, in which were thirty or forty worms of the libellula kind, each as large
as itself, destroyed them all in a few minutes; getting on their backs, and
pierc∣ing with its trunk through their body. These animals, however, though
so formidable to others, are nevertheless themselves greatly overrun with
a little kind of louse, about the size of a nit, which very probably repays
the injury which the water-scorpion inflicts upon others.</P>
<P>The water-scorpions live in the water by day; out of which
they rise in the dusk of the even∣ing into the air, and so flying from
place to place, often betake themselves, in quest of food, to other waters.
The insect, before its wings are grown, remains in the place where it was
produced; but when come to its state of per∣fection, sallies forth in
search of a companion of the other sex, in order to continue its noxious
posterity.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI. Of the Ephemera.</HEAD>
<P>THE last insect we shall add to this second order, is
the Ephemera; which, though not strictly belonging to it, yet seems more
pro∣perly referred to this rank than any other. In∣deed, we must not attend
to the rigour of method, in an history where Nature seems to take delight
to sport in variety.</P>
<P>That there should be a tribe of flies whose duration
extends but to a day, seems at first surprizing; but the wonder will
encrease, when we are told, that some of this kind seem to be born and to
die in the space of a single hour. The reptile, however, from which they
are bred, is by no means so short lived; but is sometimes seen to live
two years, and many times three years together.</P>
<P>All ephemeras, of which there are various kinds, are produced
from the egg, in the form of worms; from whence they change into a more perfect
form; namely, that of Aurelias, which is a kind of middle state between a
worm and a fly: and from thence they take their last mutation, which is into
a beautiful fly, of <PB N="362" REF="371"/> longer or shorter duration,
according to its kind.</P>
<P>The ephemera, in its fly state, is a very beautiful winged
insect, and has a strong simi∣litude to the butterfly, both from its
shape and its wings. It is about the size of a middling butterfly; but its
wings differ, in not being covered with the painted dust with which those
of butterflies are adorned, and rendered opake, for they are very transparent
and very thin. These insects have four wings, the uppermost of which are
much the largest: when the insect is at rest, it generally lays its wings
one over the other, on the back. The body is long, being formed of six rings,
that are larger at the origin than near the extremity; and from this a tail
proceeds, that is longer than all the rest of the fly, and consists
sometimes of three threads of an equal length, or sometimes of two long and
one short. To acquire this beautiful form, the insect has been obliged to
undergo several transmutations: but its glory is very short lived, for
the hour of its perfection is the hour of its death; and it seems scarcely
intro∣duced to pleasure, when it is obliged to part with life.</P>
<P>The reptile that is to become a fly, and that is granted so
long a term, when compared to its <PB N="363" REF="372"/> latter duration, is an
inhabitant of the water, and bears a very strong resemblance to fishes,
in many particulars; having gills by which it breathes at the bottom, and
also the tapering form of aquatic animals. These insects have six
scaly legs, fixed on their corselet. Their head is triangular: the eyes are
placed forward, and may be distinguished by their largeness and colour.
The mouth is furnished with teeth; and the body consists of six rings;
that next the corselet being largest, but growing less and less to the
end: the last ring is the shortest, from which the three threads proceed,
which are as long as the whole body. Thus we see that the reptile bears a
very strong resemblance to the fly; and only requires wings, to be very
near its perfection.</P>
<P>As there are several kinds of this animal, their aurelias
are consequently of different colours; some yellow, some brown, and
some cream-coloured. Some of these also bore them∣selves cells at the
bottom of the water, from which they never stir out, but feed upon the mud
composing the walls of their habitation, in contented captivity; others, on
the contrary, range about, go from the bottom to the surface, swim between
two waters, quit that element entirely to feed upon plants by the river side,
<PB N="364" REF="373"/> and then return to their favourite element, for safety
and protection.</P>
<P>The reptile, however, though it lives two or three years,
offers but little, in its long du∣ration, to excite curiosity: it is hid at
the bot∣tom of the water, and feeds almost wholly within its narrow
habitation. The most striking facts command our attention during the
short interval of its fly state; into which it crouds the most various
transactions of its little life. It then may be said to be in a hurry to
live, as it has but so small a time to exist. The peculiar sign whereby
to know that these reptiles will change into flies in a short time,
consists in a protuberance of the wings on the back. About that time the
smooth and depressed form of the upper part of the body, is changed into
a more swolen and rounder shape; so that the wings are in some degree
visible through the external sheath that covers them. As they are not
na∣tives of England, he who would see them in their greatest abundance,
must walk, about sun-set, along the banks of the Rhine, or the Seine,
near Paris; where, for about three days, in the midst of the summer, he
will be astonished at their numbers and assiduity. The thickest
descent of the flakes of snow in winter seem not to equal their number;
the whole air seems alive <PB N="365" REF="374"/> with the new-born race; and
the earth itself is all over covered with their remains. The au∣relias, or
reptile insects, that are as yet beneath the surface of the water, wait
only for the ap∣proach of evening to begin their transformation. The most
industrious shake off their old gar∣ments about eight o'clock; and those
who are the most tardy, are transformed before nine.</P>
<P>We have already seen that the operation of change in other
insects is laborious and painful; but with these nothing seems shorter,
or per∣formed with greater ease. The aurelias are scarce lifted above the
surface of the water, than their old sheathing skin bursts; and through
the cavity which is thus formed, a fly issues, whose wings, at the same
instant, are unfolded, and at the same time lift it into the air. Millions
and millions of aurelias, rise in this manner to the surface; and at once
become flies, and fill every quarter with their flutterings. But all these
sports are shortly to have an end; for as the little strangers live but
an hour or two, the whole swarm soon falls to the ground, and covers the
earth, like a deep snow, for several hundred yards, on every side of the
river. Their num∣bers are then incredible, and every object they touch becomes
fatal to them; for they instantly die, if they hit against even each
other.</P>
<P><PB N="366" REF="375"/>At this time the males and females are
very differently employed. The males, quite inactive and apparently without
desires, seem only born to die: no way like the males of other insects;
they neither follow the opposite sex, nor bear any enmity to each other:
after fluttering for an hour or two, they drop upon land, without seeming to
receive wings for scarce any other purpose but to satisfy an idle
curiosity. It is otherwise with the females; that are scarce risen from
the surface of the water, and have dried their wings, but they hasten to
drop their eggs back again. If they happen also to flutter upon land, they
deposit their burthen in the place where they drop. But then it may be
demanded, where and in what manner are these eggs fecun∣dated, as no
copulation whatever appears be∣tween the sexes, in their transitory
visits in air? Swammerdam is of opinion, that they are im∣pregnated in the
manner of fish-spawn, by the male, after being ejected by the female: but,
beside that this doctrine is exploded even from the history of fishes, it
is certain, that the males have not time for this operation, as the eggs drop
to the bottom the instant they are laid on the water. Reaumur is of opinion
that they copulate; but that the act bears a proportion in shortness to the
small duration of their lives; <PB N="367" REF="376"/> and, consequently,
must be so soon performed, as to be scarcely visible. This, however,
is at best forcing a theory; and, it is probable, that as there are many
insects known to breed with∣out any impregnation from the male, as we have
already seen in muscles and the oysters, and shall hereafter see in
the gnat, and a species of the beetle, so the ephemera may be of this
number. Be this as it may, the females are in such haste to deposite
their eggs, that multitudes of them fall to the ground; but the greatest part
are laid in the water. As they flutter upon the surface, two clusters are
seen issuing from the extremity of their body, each containing about
three hundred and fifty eggs, which make seven hundred in all. Thus, of all
insects, this appears to be the most prolific; and it would seem that
there was a necessity for such a supply, as, in its reptile state, it
is the favourite food of every kind of fresh-water fish. It is in vain that
these little animals form galleries at the bottom of the river, from whence
they seldom remove; many kinds of fish break in upon their retreats, and
thin their numbers. For this reason fishermen are careful to provide
themselves with these insects, as the most grate∣ful bait; and thus
turn the fish's rapacity to its own destruction.</P>
<P><PB N="368" REF="377"/>But though the usual date of those
flies is two or three hours at farthest, there are some kinds that live
several days; and one kind in particular, after quitting the water, has
another case or skin to get rid of. These are often seen in the fields
and woods, distant from the water; but they are more frequently found in its
vici∣nity. They are often found sticking upon walls and trees; and frequently
with the head down∣wards, without changing place, or having any sensible
motion. They are then waiting for the moment when they shall be divested of
their last incommodious garment, which sometimes does not happen for two or
three days together.</P>
