<DIV2 TYPE="description">
<P>The Caterpillar of this singular Insect is very common in May; it is of a green colour, with a white stripe down the back, and one on each side; it casts its skin several times.</P>
<P>We have observed some Caterpillars which were quite smooth, after casting their skin become rough or covered with hairs; and others which
<PB N="6" REF="7"/>
were white become black by the same process; in this caterpillar we have observed a similar change: a specimen which was of a plain green as before described, became suddenly spotted with black as shewn in our plate, that skin being cast off it assumed its former appearance and became a pupa.</P>
<P>It feeds on grass, nettles, &amp;c. near the sides of ditches, and is found sporting in the evening, when in the fly state among the grass and herbage.</P>
<P>The Caterpillar becomes a Pupa about the beginning of June.—It affixes itself by the tail to a stalk of grass in the same manner as those of the Butterfly genus, and like them is often found with the head suspended downwards; it can by a sudden spring turn itself upright again.</P>
<P>In a little book entitled the AURELIAN'S POCKET COMPANION, by Moses Harris, we find this species described, and called the <HI>White Plumed,</HI> but the Linnaean specified Name <HI>Didactyla</HI> is added:—And under the Linnaean name Pentadactyla (our present specimen) he has described the <HI>Brown plumed</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Another specimen of the same division of the genus <HI>(Aluctae)</HI> but of a brown colour "Alis fissis fuscis, &amp;c." <HI>Linn.</HI></NOTE>.—The same confusion is extended to his folio work the AURELIAN. In Plate 1. he has figured the White plumed under the specific name Didactyla, and in Plate 30, the Brown plume, under Pentadactyla. Linnaeus has comprised all those Lepi∣dopterous Insects whose wings appear to consist of several distinct feathers, connected only at the shafts, under the subdivision <HI>Aluctae,</HI> but Fabricius has given them the new name PTEROPHORUS, and added the name Alucitae to a small division of the Tinea, as Phal. Christylostella, &amp;c. of <HI>Linn.</HI></P>
<P>The Phal. Pentadactyla appears in the perfect state about the latter end of June, sometimes earlier.</P>

<P><PB N="16" REF="19"/>The Caterpillar of the Goat Moth feeds on the internal substance of willow trees; it is said to be also found in the body of the oak, but we have never discovered any in such a situation. The eggs are laid in the crevices of the trees; as soon as the Caterpillars are hatched, they begin to pierce into the solid wood. In most parts of England they are called Auger Worms; the holes which they make in the timber appearing as if bored with that Instrument.</P>
<P>It lives in the Caterpillar state three years before it is transformed to a pupa; when full fed it is four inches long, the body appears very fleshy, and without hairs; the head is black, and armed with very sharp forceps; the case is composed of bits of wood and saw-dust, which it unites with a strong web; the inside is lined with a fine smooth white filmy substance, like sattin; it passes to the pupa state in the cavity which it has perforated in the caterpillar state, within three or four inches of the opening: it remains only two months in that state before the Fly is produced.</P>
<P>Is found in chrysalis in May; in the fly state, the latter end of June, or in July.</P>

<P>We have never found this Insect common, though it must not be considered as a rare species; it is seldom met with near London: our specimen was found in the Caterpillar state at Dartford in May. It changed to Chrysalis in June. The fly came forth in September.</P>
<P>The male is rather smaller than the female generally, though not always. The strength of their colours is very inconstant, especially in the female, which we have seen very dark in some specimens; in others nearly as pale as the male; the general distinction however between the two sexes is, the male being of a light grey with spots and waves of brown, the female of an obscure brown with spots more diffused.</P>

<P>The wonderful instinct that directs the smallest Insects to provide for the safety of their future progeny, never fails to strike the attention of the inquisitive researcher into their oeconomy.—To perpetuate their
<PB N="32" REF="35"/>
race is the great end of their being, and the most astonishing effort of their ingenuity and care is employed to perfect this grand design. We not only find innumerable eggs, and larvae of Insect on all kinds of plants; in all standing waters; and in animal matter, when putrid; but many which can only be hatched from the egg by the warmth of living animals; thus the Tabanus pierces the thick hide of the Cow, and plunges its eggs into the flesh; the heat and moisture of which nourishes both in the egg, and larva; the Hippobosca equina pro∣trudes its eggs into the <HI>rectum</HI> of Horses; and the Ichneumon into living Caterpillars: to those we could add many remarkable instances of Insects, who have shewn a lower species of perception, by deposit∣ing their eggs in places where the larvae would find abundance of proper food; and with such ingenious contrivances for their safety in a defenceless state, as we could only expect from the sagacity of larger animals; but it is only our intention to premise with those general re∣marks, lest the subject we have chosen for our present Plate should be considered as a solitary example of such ingenuity, and care towards their future offspring.</P>
<P>The Natural History of the Common Bee has been both fully and ably treated of, by <HI>Schirach, Maraldi, Reaumur, Debraw,</HI> and other authors of respectability, and may be supposed to be pretty generally known by those conversant in rural affairs; the manners, however, of other species of the same genus has neither been so fully explained, nor examined; they yet present a fund for the enquiries of the Na∣turalist, equally worthy his attention; though less beneficial; as the honey they make cannot be converted to our use.</P>
<P>Among the solitary Bees, some penetrate into the earth, scoop out hollow cavities; then polish the sides within, and deposit their eggs, with proper food for the larvae, till it becomes a Pupa. Others form nests of loose sand, which they glue together with a strong cement; those nests are generally formed against walls that are exposed to the south; without, they are rude and irregular, but within are very neatly finished, and divided into several cells or apartments, in each of which the Parent Bee lodges an egg. Of our present, and a few other species, we may say,
<Q><PB N="33" REF="36"/>
<L>In firmest oak they scoop a spacious tomb,</L>
<L>And lay their embryo in the spurious womb <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Brookes on Universal Beauty.</NOTE>.</L></Q></P>
<P>We find this season, the Apis Centuncularis has done considerable injury among the Timber Plantations in <HI>Essex;</HI> and we have similar information from some parts of <HI>Cambridgeshire.</HI> A Gentleman sent me (early in the Spring) a piece of Oak, containing a quantity of the larva, from his plantation at <HI>Birdbrook,</HI> in <HI>Essex.</HI> He informs me, several Gentlemen in his neighbourhood had found large trunks of apparently healthy Oaks, completely perforated and filled with the larva of this mischievous Insect; in many instances the trunk had been materially injured, and the cases were arranged as shewn by the hori∣zontal Section at Fig. 4, in our Plate.—The perforations were in a longitudinal direction, several feet through the solid timber, and when the leaves were fresh, appeared as shewn at Fig. 1.</P>
<P>The Insect commences its operation at the upper part of the trunk of the tree; then boring in an oblique direction for about two inches or more, it follows a longitudinal course, it divides the ligneous fibres, or threads, till it forms the diameter of the cavity, which is about three-eighths of an inch, its depth various; sometimes only a few inches, at others, considerably more; when the cavity is entirely formed, and all the dust and fragments cleared away, it finishes the sides perfectly smooth; the hardest knot in the timber being insufficient to resist the strength of its jaws.—The cavity, when finished, appears divided by slight ridges, placed at the distance of about three quarters of an inch from each other; this serves to regulate the size of each apartment or cell; and it now only remains to be lined for the reception of the egg: this lining is generally composed of rose-leaves; and is applied to the apartments in a very curious manner: the Parent Bee flies with a leaf to the orifice of the perforation, where she clips it round to the size of the hole; this is forced to the bottom of the lowest cell; about seven, eight, or ten of such pieces form the first layer; it next forms the sides, or cylindrical part of the lining; this is done by laying several whole leaves partly over each
<PB N="34" REF="37"/>
other, as shewn in our Plate, and cementing them together with a glutinous substance; thus the sides and bottom, each consisting of several layers, being finished, (in the form of a thimble) the Bee partly fills it with a kind of paste, then throws over it a small quantity of leaves, reduced to powder, and deposits the egg; the covering to the whole is formed of the same materials, and in the same manner as the bottom; when she has forced about ten or fifteen circular pieces of leaves into the avenue and cemented them to the top, the covering is completed, and the egg is completely secured from accident.—The covering separated is shewn in the Plate, at fig. 3, the larvae, at fig. 2.</P>
<P>In this manner she proceeds with, and finishes every cell distinctly, till the perforation is entirely filled: in some trees forty or fifty such perforations are placed within a quarter of an inch of each other.— The Bee comes forth late in August; if the lowest is formed before those above, it eats its way up the channel, through their cases.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Adams,</HI> in his Essay on the Microscope, mentions a remarkable circumstance of a Bee (we suspect of this species). "A friend of mine (says he) had a piece of wood cut from a strong post <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">We learn this post was fir.</NOTE> that supported the roof of a cart-house, full of these cells or round holes, three-eighths of an inch diameter, and about three-fourths deep, each of which was filled with these rose-leaf cases, finely covered in at top and bottom."</P>

<P>It has been suspected by some Entomologists, that this Insect should only be considered as a variety of Curculio Argentatus. Much of its beautiful appearance depends on the time we take it in; when first hatched its colours are very rich and highly glossed with gold, but it gradually becomes dirty brown, or almost black.</P>
<P>The cause of this alteration in its appearance is easily perceived by the microscope; the first, or ground colour is dark brown, but is entirely covered with oblong scales of various beautiful colours, particularly of a reddish gold, or bronze, interspersed with those of green, and brown colour; when the Insect is first hatched, the scales lay over each other so as to conceal the ground colour; but as they rub off, or are otherwise injured, the brown becomes the general colour.—They vary also very much from red, to
<PB N="37" REF="41"/>
yellow, or green hues, when first hatched; and are sometimes found late in the season, with almost every scale rubbed off.</P>

<P>A very rare species of Phalaena. In the perfect state it is seldom met with; and in the Caterpillar state few Collectors are acquainted with its haunts. It feeds on the sallow, willow, and poplar, and may be found sometimes by stripping off the bark of those trees.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="49"/>Our specimen was taken in the vicinity of Oak-of-Honor Hill, Surry. The Caterpillar was met with when it was ready to spin its web, in which state it is represented; its spinning was formed be∣tween the folds of a leaf in the month of October, the Moth came forth in May.</P>

<P>We were not so fortunate as to take this Insect, it was commu∣nicated by a person on whose veracity we can rely: he found it on the bark of an old willow tree, between Dulwich Common and
<PB N="52" REF="56"/>
Norwood, on, or about the 8th of June, 1794. As we know the precise spot where it was taken, we shall attend to it particularly next season, and the earliest intimation of success, shall be given through the medium of a future number.</P>
<P>When we consider how much the study of coleopterous Insects has been neglected in this country, even by those who have pursued with unremitting perseverance almost every other branch of Ento∣mology, we cannot be much astonished that such a minute Insect as the <HI>Buprestis Salicis</HI> should have escaped notice; add to this, we can scarcely doubt that it is very rare in this country, and probably lives concealed in the crevices of the tree, or under the rotten part of the bark. The number of new Insects that have been discovered in this country within a few years <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Among the rarities met with last summer, we may particularly mention the Pha∣laena Delphinii, <HI>Pease Blossom Moth.</HI> This very beautiful Insect was taken by a Gentle∣man at Chelsea; it was never ascertained before to be an English Insect.</NOTE>, renders it not improbable, that future English Entomologists, by extending their enquiries, may find many more of the species that are now met with in the northern, and per∣haps even southern parts of Europe.</P>

<P>In the larva and pupa state, this Insect is found under loose stones at the bottom of shallow pools; in the winged state it frequents the water.</P>
<P>We have several species of this genus in England. The Ephe∣mera Vulgata, is the largest among them. A very distinguishing character of them is the shortness of their lives, which seldom ex∣ceeds a few hours. In the month of May these Insects are seen in great plenty on the water, where they are greedily devoured by the fish; anglers say, when the large Ephemera appears, the trout will snap at no other bait, than the artificial fly made after its form.— In some specimens the wings are more clouded, and the tails longer than in others.</P>

have met with several about the narrow lanes in Darent-wood, Dart∣ford, in April, or early in the month of May. It is however very difficult to breed them; they generally die in the pupa state, or be∣fore they cast their last skin when caterpillars; from several speci∣mens taken during the three last summers, we have only had one Moth produced, and that so crippled, as merely to enable us to as∣certain the species.</P>
<P>The small Caterpillars are of a dark purplish colour, when nearly full fed they have a yellow under side marked with black, with the back purple; before they change to the pupa state, they become almost brown.</P>
<P>They remain only a month in the pupa state. The Moth appears about the middle of June.—Food, white-thorn and alder.</P>

<HEAD>PHALAENA ANASTOMOSIS. FIG. IV.</HEAD>
<P>Since the publication of the last Number, we have been favoured with a most beautiful specimen of the Moth figured in the 124th Plate of this Work, and present a figure of it to our subscribers, together with the several changes of the Phalaena Hastata; it will shew how very liable this Insect is to variation in its colours, size, &amp;c.</P>
<P>We find also that though this Insect has been named Phalaena Anastomosis in the most scientific Cabinets in London, and always received as such by the best authority, it is not the Insect referred to by Fabricius in his Species Insectorum under that title; that Author, as well as Linnaeus, refers under the specific name <HI>Ph. Curtula</HI> to the 43d Plate of the third Volume of Roesel's Insects; in this Plate is figured a Moth which is certainly a species distinct from our Insect, and is well known by its Linnaean name <HI>Curtula,</HI> or English title <HI>Chocolate Tip;</HI> yet Fabricius gives an addi∣tional reference for the same species to the 11th Plate of Roesel's
<PB N="57" REF="62"/>
fourth Volume of Insects, and in this we find the figure of a Moth whose markings and general appearance correspond with our speci∣men, though its colours are totally different, being a very pale grey with scarcely any dark colour near the apex of the wings; the larva much more resembles our figure, and induces us to conclude, that though the figure of this last Moth is so extremely different, it is probably intended for the same species as our Insect; and therefore that the two distinct species have been confounded together, by a false quotation of Linnaeus's Amanuensis.</P>
<P>And we are partly confirmed in this supposition by the words of Linnaeus himself; he says, <HI>Ph. Anastomosis</HI> is very like <HI>Ph. Curtula,</HI> but the Moth figured in Roesel's plate, and referred to in the Syno∣nyms under Anastomosis, does not bear the least resemblance to it; —our Insect on the contrary, though evidently a distinct species, is not unlike it.</P>

<P>The present species is perhaps not uncommon in many places, but it is very difficult to discover its hiding-places in the day-time; its chirp is sometimes heard in a calm Summer's evening, about sun-set, issuing from the bushes where it is concealed; and from which it seldom ventures till night: it continues its chirping at in∣tervals till morning.</P>
<P>The female seems to prefer a warm, and rather moist situation, to deposit her eggs in, and this is commonly the side of a bank that is exposed to the sun; but is well covered with grass and other herbage to keep it moist. She is furnished with a sharp double edged sheath, like a <HI>sword,</HI> with which she opens the ground in a perpendicular direction; first scooping out a convenient cylindrical aperture, and then widening the lower part into a spacious apartment for the re∣ception of the eggs. <HI>See</HI> Fig. I.</P>
<P>When the Insect bursts from the egg it is very minute, and with∣out Wings; in this state it nips the tender shoots of grass, &amp;c. It soon increases in size and assumes the pupa form; in which state though the Wings are not perfect, their rudiments appear next the Thorax: it continues in this state till it has nearly acquired its full size before the Wings burst open from the protuberances.</P>

<P><PB N="62" REF="68"/>In the months of June and July, or earlier in forward seasons, this Insect is found in great plenty in the lanes and skirts of woods; and are very troublesome to persons or animals who pass through such places in the middle of the day: they conceal themselves in the crevices of the bark of trees, or among the foliage till about an hour before noon, when they come forth in great plenty, and settle on the hands and face, or other thinly covered parts, and dart their sharp pointed trunks or proboscis into the flesh: we have observed the sting of this Insect to be most severe about mid-day, particularly when the sun shines bright, and emits much heat; a disagreeable sensation continues in the stung part for some time, and is generally succeeded by a large tumor, and a slight discharge of pungent fluid before it disappears entirely.</P>
<P>To explain more minutely the structure of the trunk, we have given a figure of its magnified appearance at Fig. III: the outer coat, or sheath, terminates at its extremity, in two lateral, moveable lips, and contains a longitudinal, horny, convex blade; the acute point of which is concealed between these lips: this interior tube, when examined with a Microscope, appears to consist of three others, exceedingly sharp at the points; and are used by the Insect as lancets to lacerate the flesh when it feeds, while it pumps, or sucks up the blood and moisture from the wound, through the capillary tubes with which several parts of the trunk are furnished.</P>
<P>It feeds in the same manner on Insects, but chiefly on those in the larva state.</P>

<P>We have been furnished with the larva of this extremely rare Insect in a singular manner; a wasted specimen of the female was taken in the Summer of the year 1794, and deposited a quantity of eggs in the box in which it was stuck; these hatching some time after, a great number of young Caterpillars were produced; several of a full size, passed to the pupa state, (in a reddish web spun on the leaves) and four fine Moths came forth last Summer.</P>
<P>The eggs were very minute, perfectly globular, and of a pale greenish colour: the cluster consisted of more than seventy, and few of them proved abortive; but some of the largest Caterpillars de∣voured

the rest, and many others wandered from the food, and so perished.

<P>Among an almost endless variety of species, which the tribes of Insects present, few have a more singular appearance than the little creature we have selected for our present subject. It is perhaps one of the most curious pieces of natural mechanism (if we may be allowed the expression) that can be conceived, for of a most com∣plicated fabric which the wings appear, every part, though separate,
<PB N="76" REF="83"/>
acts in perfect unison with the rest; in most winged Insects we find the tendons of each wing united by strong membranaceous webs, which prevent any one from acting without the others, but in this every tendon must perform a distinct part, and yet perfectly in conformity with the rest to assist the Insect in its flight. When the Insect rests the feathers fold over one another; but when it flies, they are thrown open, and resemble a full expanded fan.</P>
<P>The natural size of this singular creature is given at Fig. 1. and as a more correct figure than can be shewn in such a small compass was thought necessary, its magnified appearance is represented at Fig. 2.</P>
<P>The plumes of this Insect differs so much from those of other Moths, that we have also added, at Fig. 3, the appearance of the upper part of one, as seen by a very deep lens of the Microscope; by this the stem or quil is observed covered with scales of the form usually found on other Moths, but the sides are finely feathered with long hairs, in tufts, alternately of a light and dark colour, and which, owing to the minuteness of the Insect appear like patches of an uniform colour, before it is examined with the Microscope.</P>

<P><HI>Berkenhout</HI> has given a very false description of the Caterpillar of this Insect, he says it is "smooth, orange with white spots;" we think it necessary to note this error only as it may mislead young Collectors, who have no other assistant than his Synopsis, by which they can determine the Species, when in the Caterpillar state. It is astonishing how he could possibly be led into this error, when <HI>Albin, Fabricius</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Larva</HI> solitaria, gibbosa, viridis albo striata. <HI>Fabricius.</HI></NOTE>, and all preceding authors on Entomology, have described it so plainly.</P>
<P>It feeds on Nettles, and other Plants, growing among the low herbage by the side of banks; in fine seasons there are generally two broods of them from May, to June in the following year; the first are found early in May in the Caterpillar state, appear in June in the winged state; Caterpillars are full fed again in July, the Moths come forth in August.</P>

<P>This species is far less common than <HI>Cassida Viridis.</HI> It is a very beautiful Insect; but, like most other minute species, appears with infinitely more advantage in the Microscope for opake objects; in∣deed, without such assistance, it is impossible to perceive the beauty of that part by which it is distinguished from every other species of the same genus we have in England, the lines of fine gold and blue, which are seen on the middle of the Shells.</P>
<P>When the Insect is alive, it is of a pale greenish colour, inclining to brownish grey, and along the middle of each Shell appears a splendid streak, or line of gold, margined with a fine pale sky blue, alternately varying into green, and gold. By the Microscope we
<PB N="80" REF="89"/>
also discover many minute punctures, and several waved lines and streaks, which descend along the Shells from the base, and unite near the apex.</P>
<P>Its colours are more or less beautiful as the Insect is healthy or sickly; and as it dies, the colours gradually perish; the splendor of gold is no longer visible than life is retained, it changes to green; from green to a brown, which scarcely appears through a faint tinge of blue, and in a few hours it changes altogether to a rusty brown colour.</P>
<P>This Insect is admirably protected from external injury by the singular form of its Thorax and Shells, which are also so large as to conceal every other part when the Insect walks.</P>

<P>A figure of this Insect is given in Villers's Entomology as a native of France; in this he follows the authority of Fourcroy, who has a description of the same species in his Catalogue of Insects, found in the environs of Paris. This last author calls it Le Cigale renflée, from its puffed or swelled appearance. The name given by Villers is Cicada dilatata.</P>
<P>The confusion made by Fabricius, in his alterations of the <HI>Lin∣naean genera,</HI> renders it doubtful whether he has described this Insect, though, from its being commonly found in most parts of Europe, we must suppose he has not passed over it without notice: we have examined his last work, (Entomologia Systematica, &amp;c.) and cannot find an Insect answering our species with any reference either to Fourcroy or Villers, we therefore prefer the specific name given by the latter author.</P>

<P><PB N="84" REF="93"/>The Phalaena Meticulosa certainly exceeds many other Insects of the same tribe for elegance and simplicity: the variety of teints so delicately, indeed almost insensibly softened into one another, and neatness of the waves and lines interspersed over the whole, amply compensate for the defection of more gaudy colours. In the cater∣pillar state it is scarcely less deserving attention; the yellow specks on a beautiful, yet lucid green, have a very pleasing effect. The web it spins round its pupa is of a fine white colour, and silky tex∣ture; the pupa within of a blackish chocolate colour.</P>
<P>This species is sometimes met with in plenty, though less so in some seasons than in others; and not unfrequently is more abundant when the season appears most unfavourable. It feeds on nettles chiefly, but we have found it on several other plants; and once on a young oak, in Kent; the leaves of which we fed it on some time. In the caterpillar state it is found in April, changes to the pupa state in May, the Moth appears in June.</P>

thick and the bark covered with moss, &amp;c. and very seldom among young trees. In the Caterpillar state it lives concealed in a fine silky web, spun up on the leaves. When it is disturbed it drops by a single thread from one branch to another, the glutinous substance of the thread adhering wherever it touches, so that if it is damaged in any part the Insect is in no danger of falling, unless the last fast∣ening breaks off. The Caterpillar changes to the pupa state early in June: the first appearance of the Moth is commonly about the end of the same month.</P>
<P>In England we have another small Moth (Phalaena Chlorana) which at first sight may be mistaken for Phalaena Viridana. It differs from this Insect in several respects; the under Wings are whiter, and the stripe along the anterior margin of the upper Wings incline more to a cream colour than in our present species; the Caterpillar also is very different and feeds on the Willow.</P>
