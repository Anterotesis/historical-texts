<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> Wish I could have brought this Play upon the Stage with less Violence to its Author, and not so much Respon∣sibility on my own Part. New cha∣racters of necessity require some dis∣play. Many original passages of the first merit are still retained, and in the contemplation of them, my errors, I hope, will be overlooked or forgiven; In examining the Bril∣liancy of a Diamond, few people throw away any Remarks upon the dullness of the foil.</P>

<L>You see this confluence, this great flood of visiters.</L>
<L>I have upon a high and pleasant hill</L>
<L>Feign'd <HI>Fortune</HI> to be thron'd. The base o' th' mount</L>
