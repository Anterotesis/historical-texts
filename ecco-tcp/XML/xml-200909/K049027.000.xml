<P>Why, that's very pretty indeed, so, I am to stay here
freezing by way of a direction post, I got tipsey and lost my money in
France, and began to come to myself, when I was about half seas over; and
now when I thought, I shou'd be comfortable by a good fire, I must remain
freezing here, in all the horrors of sobriety. It is the fate of genius to
make discoveries by which other people profit—why, who have we here?
sure it can't be! yes it is—what my dear Master, Sir Palamede!</P>

accompany the Lady, because my Grandson, Martin here, will be your guide to
the Baron of Oakland's Castle.</P>

<P>What, d'ye say—why then who is this lord?</P>

behind their backs, for that it might get to their ears again.</P>

<P>Why, then Sir, you must know that about ten years ago, the old
Baron, Lord William, was accused of being in a plot, and conspiring
against the life of our good King William, the Con∣queror, and was
banished.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>I remember it.</P>

<P>Alas!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maud</SPEAKER>
<P>The King willing to make reperation, for the wrongs he had done
him, endeavoured to find him, but all in vain, therefore his lands and

<P>O, my lord de Courcy, I am glad I have found you, I have
strange news to tell you: only think my lord, when I thought my vassals
had re∣tired fatigued, and gone dutifully drunk to bed, the whole village is up
and scouring their old hel∣mets and armour; I am sure there's mischief in
the wind when these rascals are so industrious.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>De Cour</SPEAKER>
<P>Compose yourself my lord, you seem quite
alarm'd!—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bar</SPEAKER>
<P>Alarm'd my lord! why, tho' I am naturally as brave as a lion;
yet I do not like to be taken thus by surprize; it is that which alarms
me—and Sir Palamede I am sure is at the bottom of this.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>De Cour</SPEAKER>
<P>Perhaps then he has heard of my ar∣rival, and finding himself
discovered, means to op∣pose force by force.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bar</SPEAKER>
<P>You are right my lord, he has been send∣ing and receiving
letters and messages all night in a continual ebb and flow of
mischief.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>S'death, can he descend so low as to mislead the rabble
into revolt—the traitor shall perish—but where is my

<P>I don't know my lord, but here comes my son, I dare say

<P>I believe she was once attached to another, one Sir
Palamede.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>I believe not friend, and my reason for thinking so, is that
the dear little wench never saw Sir Palamede in all her life.</P>
