<HEAD>A CHARGE TO THE POETS.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>FULL twenty years have roll'd, ye rhiming band,</L>
<L>Since first I dipp'd in ink my trembling hand,</L>
<L>For much it trembled, tho' th'obliging few,</L>
<L>Who judge with candour, prais'd the
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"The danger of writing Verse." First printed in the year 1741. to which this Poem may be considered as a sequel.</NOTE> sketch I drew;</L>
<L>And Echo, answering from the public voice,</L>
<L>Indulg'd as genius, what I fear'd was choice.</L>
<L>At length, arriv'd at those maturer years</L>
<L>So rarely rais'd by hope, or sunk by fears,</L>
<L>I rest in peace; or scribble if I please:</L>
<L>In point of wealth not affluent, but at ease;</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="3"/>In point of what the world and you call fame,</L>
<L>(I judge but by conjecture) much the same.</L>
<L>But whether right or wrong I judge, to you</L>
<L>It matters not: the following fact is true.</L>
<L>From nobler names, and great in each degree,</L>
<L>The pension'd Laurel has devolv'd to me.</L>
<L>To me, ye Bards; and, what you'll scarce conceive,</L>
<L>Or, at the best, unwillingly believe,</L>
<L>Howe'er unworthily I wear the crown,</L>
<L>Unask'd it came, and from a hand unknown.</L>
<L>Then, since my King, and Patron have thought fit</L>
<L>To place me on the throne of modern wit,</L>
<L>My grave advice, my brethren, hear at large;</L>
<L>As Bishops to their Clergy give their charge,</L>
<L>Tho' many a Priest, who listens, might afford</L>
<L>Perhaps more solid counsel to my Lord.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>TO YOU, ye guardians of the sacred fount,</L>
<L>Deans and Archdeacons of the double mount,</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="4"/>That thro' our realms intestine broils may cease,</L>
<L>My first, and last advice is, "Keep the peace!"</L>
<L>What is't to you, that half the town admire</L>
<L>False sense, false strength, false softness, or false fire?</L>
<L>Through heav'n's void concave let the meteors blaze,</L>
<L>He hurts his own, who wounds another's bays.</L>
<L>What is't to you that numbers place your name</L>
<L>First, fifth, or twentieth, in the lists of fame?</L>
<L>Old Time will settle all your claims at once,</L>
<L>Record the Genius, and forget the Dunce.</L>
<L>It boots us much to know, observers say,</L>
<L>Of what materials Nature form'd our clay;</L>
<L>From what strange beast Prometheus' plastic art</L>
<L>Purloin'd the particle which rules the heart.</L>
<L>If milky softness, gliding through the veins,</L>
<L>Incline the Muse to panegyric strains,</L>
<L>Insipid lays our kindest friends may lull,</L>
<L>Be very moral, yet be very dull.</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="5"/>If bile prevails, and temper dictates satire,</L>
<L>Our wit is spleen, our virtue is ill-nature;</L>
<L>With it's own malice arm'd we combat evil,</L>
<L>As zeal for God's sake sometimes plays the devil.</L>
<L>O mark it well! does Pride affect to reign</L>
<L>The solitary tyrant of the brain?</L>
<L>Or Vanity exert her quick'ning flame,</L>
<L>Stuck round with ears that listen after fame?</L>
<L>O to these points let strict regard be given,</L>
<L>Nor<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>E coelo descendit, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. <BIBL>Juv.</BIBL></Q></NOTE> "KNOW THYSELF" in vain descend from Heaven.</L>
<L>Do Critics teize you?—with a smile I speak,</L>
<L>Nor would suppose my brethren were so weak.</L>
<L>'Tis on ourselves and not our foes, or friends,</L>
<L>Our future fame, or infamy depends.</L>
<L>Let envy point, or malice wing the darts,</L>
<L>They only wound us in our mortal parts.</L>
<L>Besides, 'tis much too late to go to school,</L>
<L>Grown men will judge by Nature's noblest rule,</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="6"/>Admire true beauties, and slight faults excuse,</L>
<L>Not learn to dance from
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is not intended as a reflection on either the Journals or the Reviews. They are not the Masters but the Scholars, the Grown Gen∣tlemen, at whom the Author smiles; and who, he thinks, had much better not pretend to judge at all, than borrow opinions which never sit easy upon them.</NOTE> Journals and Reviews.</L>
<L>If fools traduce you, and your works decry,</L>
<L>As many fools will rate your worth too high;</L>
<L>Then ballance the account, and fairly take</L>
<L>The cool report which men of judgment make.</L>
<L>In writing, as in life, he foils the foe,</L>
<L>Who, conscious of his strength, forgives the blow.</L>
<L>They court the insult who but seem afraid:</L>
<L>And then, by answering, you promote the trade,</L>
<L>And give them, what their own weak claims deny,</L>
<L>A chance for future laughter, or a sigh.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>YOU, who as yet, unsullied by the Press,</L>
<L>Hang o'er your labours in their virgin dress;</L>
<L>And YOU, who late the public taste have hit,</L>
<L>And still enjoy the honey-moon of wit,</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="7"/>Attentive hear me: grace may still abound,</L>
<L>Whoever preaches, if the doctrine's sound.</L>
<L>If Nature prompts you, or if friends persuade,</L>
<L>Why write; but ne'er pursue it as a trade.</L>
<L>And soldom publish: manuscripts disarm</L>
<L>The censor's frown, and boast an added charm,</L>
<L>Enhance their worth by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ming to retire,</L>
<L>For what but few can prate of, all admire.</L>
<L>Who trade in verse, alas, as rarely find,</L>
<L>The public grateful, as the Muses kind.</L>
<L>From constant feasts like fated guests we steal,</L>
<L>And tir'd of tickling lose all power to feel.</L>
<L>'Tis novelty we want; with that in view</L>
<L>We praise stale matter, so the Bard be new;</L>
<L>Or from known Bards with exstucy receive</L>
<L>Each part new whim they almost blush to give.</L>
<L>A life of writing, unless wond'rous short,</L>
<L>No wit can brave, no genius can support.</L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="8"/>Some soberer province for your business chuse,</L>
<L>Be that your helmet, and your plume the Muse.</L>
<L>Through Fame's long rubric, down from Chaucer's time,</L>
<L>Few fortunes have been rais'd by lofty rhime.</L>
<L>And, when our toils success no longer crowns,</L>
<L>What shelter find we from a world in frowns?</L>
<L>O'er each distress, which vice or folly brings,</L>
<L>Tho' Charity extend her healing wings,</L>
<L>No Maudlin Hospitals are yet assign'd</L>
<L>For slip-shod Muses of the vagrant kind;</L>
<L>Where anthems might succeed to satires keen,</L>
<L>And hymns of penitence to songs obscene.</L>
<L>What refuge then remains?—with gracious grin</L>
<L>Some practis'd Bookseller invites you in.</L>
<L>Where luckless Bards, condemn'd to court the town,</L>
<L>(Not for their parents' vices, but their own!)</L>
<L>Write gay conundrums with an aching head,</L>
<L>Or carn by defamation daily bread,</L>
<L><PB N="12" REF="9"/>Or friendless, shirtless, pennyless complain,</L>
<L>Not of the world's, but "Caelia's cold disdain."</L>
<L>Lords of their workhouse see the tyrants sit</L>
<L>Brokers in books, and scock-jobbers in wit,</L>
<L>Beneath whose lash, oblig'd to write or fast,</L>
<L>Our confessors and martyrs breathe their last!</L>
<L>And can ye bear such insolence?—away,</L>
<L>For shame; plough, dig, turn pedlars, drive the dray;</L>
<L>With minds indignant each employment suits,</L>
<L>Our fleets want sailors, and our troops recruits;</L>
<L>And many a dirty street, on Thames's side,</L>
<L>Is yet by stool and brush unoccupied.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Time was when Poets play'd the thorough game,</L>
<L>Swore, drank, and bluster'd, and blasphem'd for fame.</L>
<L>The first in brothels with their punk and Muse;</L>
<L>Your toast, ye Bards? "Pamassus and the stews!"</L>
<L>Thank Heaven the times are chang'd; no Poet now</L>
<L>Need roar for Bacchus, or to Venus bow.</L>
<L><PB N="13" REF="10"/>'Tis our own fault if Fielding's lash <HI>we</HI> feel,</L>
<L>Or, like French wits, begin with the Bastile.</L>
<L>Ev'n in those days some few escap'd their fate,</L>
<L>By better judgment, or a longer date,</L>
<L>And rode, like buoys, triumphant o'er the tide.</L>
<L>Poor Otway in an ale-house dos'd, and died!</L>
<L>While happier Southern, tho' with spots of yore,</L>
<L>Like Plato's hovering spirits, crusted o'er,</L>
<L>Liv'd every mortal vapour to remove,</L>
<L>And to our admiration join'd our love.</L>
<L>Light lie his funeral turf!—for you, who join</L>
<L>His decent manners to his art divine,</L>
<L>Would ye (whilst, round you, toss the proud and vain</L>
<L>Convuls'd with feeling, or with giving pain)</L>
<L>Indulge the Muse in innocence and ease,</L>
<L>And tread the flowery path of life in peace?</L>
<L>Avoid all authors.—What! th' illus<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ious few,</L>
<L>Who shunning Fame have taught her to pursue</L>
<L><PB N="14" REF="11"/>Fair Virtue's heralds?—yes, I say again,</L>
<L>Avoid all authors, 'till you've read the men.</L>
<L>Full many a peevish, envious, slandering elf,</L>
<L>Is, in his works, Benevolence itself.</L>
<L>For all mankind unknown, his bosom heaves,</L>
<L>He only injures those with whom he lives.</L>
<L>Read then the Man: Does truth his actions guide,</L>
<L>Exempt from petulance, exempt from pride?</L>
<L>To social duties does his heart attend,</L>
<L>As Son, as Father, Husband, Brother, Friend?</L>
<L>Do those who know him love him? if they do,</L>
<L>You've <HI>my</HI> permission, you may love him too.</L>
<L>But chief avoid the boist'rous roaring sparks,</L>
<L>The sons of fire!—you'll know them by their marks.</L>
<L>Fond to be heard they always court a croud,</L>
<L>And, tho' 'tis borrow'd nonsense, talk it loud.</L>
<L>One epithet supplies their constant chime,</L>
<L><HI>Damn'd</HI> bad, <HI>damn'd</HI> good, <HI>damn'd</HI> low, and <HI>damn'd</HI> sublime!</L>
<L><PB N="15" REF="12"/>But most in quick short repartee they shine</L>
<L>Of local humour; or from plays purloin</L>
<L>Each quaint stale scrap which every subject hits,</L>
<L>'Till fools almost imagine, they are wits.</L>
<L>Hear them on Shakespear! there they foam, they rage!</L>
<L>Yet taste not half the beauties of HIS page,</L>
<L>Nor see that Art, as well as Nature, strove</L>
<L>To place HIM foremost in th' Aonian grove.</L>
<L>For there, there only, where the sisters meet,</L>
<L>HIS Genius triumphs, and the work's compleat.</L>
<L>Or would ye sift more near these sons of fire,</L>
<L>'Tis Garrick, and not Shakespear they admire.</L>
<L>Without his breath, inspiring every thought,</L>
<L>They ne'er perhaps had known what Shakespear wrote;</L>
<L>Without his eager, his becoming zeal,</L>
<L>To teach them, tho' they scarce know why, to feel,</L>
<L>A crude unmeaning mass had Johnson been,</L>
<L>And a dead letter Shakespear's noblest seene.</L>
<L><PB N="16" REF="13"/>O come the time, when diffidence again</L>
<L>Shall bind our youth in Nature's modest chain!</L>
<L>Born in a happier age, and happier clime,</L>
<L>Old Sophocles <HI>had</HI> merit, in his time;</L>
<L>And so, no doubt, howe'er <HI>we</HI> flout his plays,</L>
<L>Had poor Euripides, in former days.</L>
<L>Not like the moderns we confess; but yet</L>
<L>Some seeming faults we surely might forget,</L>
<L>Because 'twould puzzle even the wise to show</L>
<L>Whether those faults were real faults, or no.</L>
<L>To all true merit give it's just applause,</L>
<L>The worst have beauties, and the best have flaws.</L>
<L>Greek, French, Italian, English, great or small,</L>
<L>I own <HI>my</HI> frailty, I admire them all.</L>
<L>There are, mistaking prejudice for taste,</L>
<L>Who on one species all their rapture waste.</L>
<L>Tho', various as the flowers which paint the year,</L>
<L>In rainbow charms the changeful Nine appear,</L>
<L><PB N="17" REF="14"/>The different beauties coyly they admit,</L>
<L>And to one standard would confine our wit.</L>
<L>Some MANNER'D VERSE delights; while some can raise</L>
<L>To fairy FICTION their exstatic gaze,</L>
<L>Admire PURE POETRY, and revel there</L>
<L>On sightless forms, and pictures of the air!</L>
<L>Some hate all RHIME; some <HI>seriously</HI> deplore</L>
<L>That Milton wants that one enchantment more.</L>
<L>Tir'd with th' ambiguous tale, or antique phrase,</L>
<L>O'er Spenser's happiest paintings, loveliest lays,</L>
<L>Some heedless pass: while some with transport view</L>
<L>Each quaint old word, which scarce Eliza knew;</L>
<L>And, eager as the fancied knights, prepare</L>
<L>The lance, and combat in ideal war</L>
<L>Dragons of lust, and giants of despair.</L>
<L>Why be it so; and what each thinks the test</L>
<L>Let each enjoy: but not condemn the rest.</L>
<L><PB N="18" REF="15"/>Readers there are of every class prepar'd,</L>
<L>Each village teems, each hamlet has its Bard</L>
<L>Who gives the tone, and all th' inferior fry,</L>
<L>Like the great vulgar here, will join the cry.</L>
<L>But be it mine with every Bard to glow,</L>
<L>And taste his raptures genuine as they flow,</L>
<L>Through all the Muse's wilds to rove along</L>
<L>From plaintive Elegy to Epic song;</L>
<L>And, if the sense be just, the numbers clear,</L>
<L>And the true colouring of the work be there,</L>
<L>Again, subdued by Truth's ingenuous call,</L>
<L>I own <HI>my</HI> frailty, I admire them all.</L>
<L>Nor think I, with the mob, that Nature now</L>
<L>No longer warms the soil where laurels grow.</L>
<L>'Tis true Our Poets in repose delight,</L>
<L>And, wiser than their fathers, seldom write.</L>
<L><PB N="19" REF="16"/>Yet I, but I forbear for prudent ends,</L>
<L>Could name a list, and half of them <HI>my</HI> friends,</L>
<L>For whom posterity it's wreaths shall twine,</L>
<L>And it's own Bards neglect, to honour mine.</L>
<L>Their Poets in their turn will grieve, and swear,</L>
<L>Perhaps with truth, no Patron lends an ear.</L>
<L>Complaints of times when merit wants reward</L>
<L>Descend like similies from Bard to Bard;</L>
<L>We copy our distress from Greece and Rome;</L>
<L>As in our Northern lays their flowrets bloom.</L>
<L>We feel their breezes, with their heats we burn,</L>
<L>And plead prescription to rejoice or mourn.</L>
<L>All present times are bad: then cast your eyes</L>
<L>Where fairy scenes of bliss in prospect rise.</L>
<L>As fond enthusiasts o'er the western main</L>
<L>With eager ken, prophetical in vain,</L>
<L><PB N="20" REF="17"/>See the mixt multitudes from every land</L>
<L>Grow pure by blending, virtuous by command;</L>
<L>'Till, phoenix-like, a new bright world of gold</L>
<L>Springs from the dregs and refuse of the old.</L>
<L>I'm no enthusiast, yet with joy can trace</L>
<L>Some gleams of sunshine for the tuneful race.</L>
<L>If Monarchs listen when the Muses woo,</L>
<L>Attention wakes, and nations listen too.</L>
<L>The Bard grows rapturous, who was dumb before,</L>
<L>And every fresh-plum'd eagle learns to soar!</L>
<L>Friend of the siner arts, when Aegypt saw</L>
<L>Her second Ptolemy give Science law,</L>
<L>Each Genius waken'd from his dead repose,</L>
<L>The column swell'd, the pile majestic rose,</L>
<L>Exact proportion borrow'd strength from ease,</L>
<L>And use was taught by elegance to please.</L>
<L><PB N="21" REF="18"/>Along the breathing walls, as fancy flow'd,</L>
<L>The sculpture soften'd, and the picture glow'd,</L>
<L>Heroes reviv'd in animated stone,</L>
<L>The groves grew vocal, and the
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Seven Poets patronised by Ptolemy Philadelphus are usually called by the name of that constellation.</NOTE> Pleiads shone!</L>
<L>Old Nilus rais'd his head, and wond'ring cried,</L>
<L>Long live the King! my Patron, and my Pride!</L>
<L>Secure of endless praise, behold, I bear</L>
<L>My grateful suffrage to my Sovereign's ear.</L>
<L>Tho' war shall rage, tho' Time shall level all,</L>
<L>Yon colours sicken, and yon columns fall,</L>
<L>Tho' art's dear treasures feed the wasting flame,</L>
<L>And the proud volume sinks, an empty name,</L>
<L>Tho' Plenty may desert this copious vale,</L>
<L>My streams be scatter'd, or my fountain fail,</L>
<L><PB N="22" REF="19"/>Yet Ptolemy has liv'd: the world has known</L>
<L>A King of arts, a Patron on a throne.</L>
<L>Ev'n utmost Britain shall his name adore,</L>
<L><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"And Boyn be sung, when it has ceas'd to flow." Addison.</NOTE> "And Nile be sung, when Nile shall flow no more."</L>

<LG>
<L>One rule remains. Nor shun nor court the great,</L>
<L>Your truest center is that middle state</L>
<L>From whence with case th' observing eye may go</L>
<L>To all which soars above, or sinks below.</L>
<L>'Tis yours all manners to have tried, or known,</L>
<L>T' adopt all virtues, yet retain your own:</L>
<L>To stem the tide, where thoughtless crowds are hurl'd,</L>
<L>The firm spectators of a bustling world!</L>
<L>Thus arm'd, proceed: the breezes court your wing.</L>
<L>Go range all Helicon, taste every spring;</L>
<L><PB N="23" REF="20"/>From varying nature cull th'innoxious spoil,</L>
<L>And, whilst amusement sooths the generous toil,</L>
<L>Let puzzled Critics with judicious spite</L>
<L>Descant on what you can, or can not write.</L>
<L>True to yourselves, not anxious for renown,</L>
<L>Nor court the world's applause, nor dread it's frown.</L>
<L>Guard your own breasts, and be the bulwark there</L>
<L>To know no envy, and no malice fear.</L>
<L>At least you'll find, thus Stoic-like prepar'd,</L>
<L>That Verse and Virtue are their own reward.</L>
