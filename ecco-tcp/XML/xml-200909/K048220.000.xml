<SPEAKER>Abs.</SPEAKER>
<P>It goes cursedly against my spirit to lay all the expences of my wedding on my honest friend the taylor! What to do now to raise but a little money.

<PB N="4" REF="6"/>Now if I could deliver this letter to the Bassa myself, he'd probably give me a reward sufficient to defray the charges of my wedding. How the deuce shall I get ad∣mission though? My old Uncle has always kept me at such a distance, that I'm not even known at the palace; and the attendants there are so saucy—No, they'll never let a poor strange barber pass the antichamber. <STAGE>(Crumpy sings without)</STAGE> Odso! here comes little Crumpy, the Bassa's favourite Hunch-back jester; he's a good-natur'd fellow; and from my saving him from a beating in the street quarrel, that his jokes brought him into the other night—If I could prevail on him—he has high interest at court, and— <STAGE>(enter Crumpy singing and dancing)</STAGE> How do you do, Mr. Crumpy?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Crumpy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Fellow! <STAGE>(proudly, but changes on recollecting Absalom)</STAGE> Ha! my gay spirited—my little finger <STAGE>(holds out his hand)</STAGE> don't slip my ring off. Your prowess in that re-encounter, when those villains attacked me the other night, saved—Did you ever see the like? The fellows thresh'd me as if I was a wheat-sheaf; had I the lives of seven cats they'd have hammered them out, for there I lay like a little anvil, and the rascals laid on me like so many Cyclops, turn'd me about as if was a three-penny nail—only for your passing by just at the nick, those ruffians would have broke my bones. Yes, they'd have crack'd my ivory; their heads were so hard, and their fists so heavy, that my great wit and little body—Oh dear!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Abs.</SPEAKER>
<P>Going to the palace, I presume, Sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Crumpy</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, his Highness has got into a merry mood, and just sent for me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Abs.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then, Sir, that horse with the fine trappings, that I saw the slaves take by just now, was to carry you to court?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Crumpy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; they had the insolence to think I'd peck upon a poney; but if I must ride to court, it shall be on an elephant.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Abs.</SPEAKER>
<P>Certainly, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Crumpy.</SPEAKER>
<P>By virtue of my high office, lord chief jus∣tice joker, I am obliged, when called upon, to be pro∣vided with some comical story to divert him, entre nous, though my wit is as ready as any man's, I am some times plaguily put to it; but as I'm determined to keep my place to pick up novelty and character, I get upon those night rambles in the street, which often, with a little of my ingenuity in dressing up, furnish a good merry tale or pleasant incident for the Bassa to laugh at the next morning.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="5" REF="7"/>
<SPEAKER>Abs.</SPEAKER>
<P>I thought, Sir, you statesmen was too wise to laugh?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Crumpy.</SPEAKER>
<P>He that's wise enough to refuse a good hearty laugh in this world, will be cursedly bob'd, if there should be no laughing in the next. Here he has sent for me now, takes me a little unprovided, so I'll go make my bow, and retire.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Abs.</SPEAKER>
<P>What a prodigious favourite you are, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Crumpy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, ay; the Circassian beauties dance am∣bassadories; black, blue and yellow pay compliments; courtiers smile, cringe and tell lies, but no life at court without little Crumpy <STAGE>(sings and dances).</STAGE> Oh, barber, could you supply me with a decent, fashionable, flourishing whisker?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Abs.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Sir, you've a very handsome pair al∣ready.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Crumpy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Only one real, t'other was pluck'd off by the roots in that affray; this is false, a favourite lock fell from the forehead of a celebrated beauty at the last ball, I pick'd it up, and stuck it on with a little gum, and it graces the lip of her humble admirer. Ha! ha! ha!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Abs.</SPEAKER>
<P>How gallant.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Crumpy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yet the courtiers smil'd, the ladies teehee'd, but <HI>Honi soit,</HI>—I should not wonder if the circumstance gave birth to an order of knighthood, and the black eagle and golden fleece give way to the knights of the whisker.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Abs.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha! ha! ha! Sir, I've a letter here for the Bassa, and—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Crumpy.</SPEAKER>
<P>A petition? Give it me; I'll deliver it into his Highness's own hand?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Abs.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah, Sir, if you'd only procure me the honour of laying it at his Highness's own feet?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Abs.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, but will his Highness condescend to listen to so poor a fellow as I?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Crumpy.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, don't you know our Bassa has tra∣velled through Europe, been at the English court, whose king has been the model for all his noblest actions, like their gracious monarch, the father of his people, he is above the little consideration of the co∣lour of a face, or the sod where a man first drew breath, when diftress is to be relieved or merit rewarded.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Abs.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, Sir, if any of the grand officers in waiting should stop me?</P>

Your friend for ever, SELIM, Vizier.</Q></P>

<P>Of such consequence! then I'll come in for my share <STAGE>(aside)</STAGE>. Yes, my Lord, I thought it my duty to see it delivered to your Highness; the young man here was for running back in a vast hurry to finish dressing a lady, daughter of a grand French merchant; but, says I, man alive, never mind her; bring this to the Bassa directly: for, my Lord, says I, is the most generous, liberal, prince-conditioned—he won't matter what he gives you and I for this piece of service. Well, Sir, he would go, I insisted he should come; he brandishes his curling tongs; I whip'd out my sabre, tuck'd him under my arm, and in five strides of a game cock, dash'd into the palace, cut, kick'd, shuffled and elbow'd my way through the guards, mutes, janizaries.—Here I've' have brought him, while poor mademoiselle waits, her hair half papered, half friz'd, fretting like an affronted porcu∣pine, ha! ha! ha!</P>

I and my guitar are tun'd for a frolic. I must sally now into the streets in search of a night adventure, to lay in a morning's hearty laugh for the Bassa. You'll come. When I'm in my joking humour I like to have one in company that's able to fight for me. I can fight myself, but I'd as leave let it alone, Indeed I have never been matched; bigger than myself won't fight me; less than myself I scorn to fight; and a man exactly my own size must be such a microcosm, such a neat picture of perfection, that I could not find in my heart to hurt him.

<P>I have got his murder off my shoulders mighty lucky! <STAGE>(aside)</STAGE> What a wicked man you must be to kill my dear little friend!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bassa.</SPEAKER>
<P>What proof, that this is the murderer?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Crank.</SPEAKER>
<P>Please your worship—Mr.—my Lord Mayor—I confess I did give this pretty little gentleman a dowse, but if it did kill 'twas in my own defence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bassa.</SPEAKER>
<P>How?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Crank.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can't drink alone—he wou'dn't drink with me—I should die without drinking—so let your jury of twelve bring it in manslaughter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bassa.</SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(apart to Babouc)</STAGE>
<P>I've thought of a method to come at the truth of this matter. Whoever kill'd him, instead of punishment shall have a reward. This buffoon was once my favourite, but growing most in∣tolerably stupid, I've long wish'd him out of my way. Give the Briton a purse of a thousand tomilees.</P>

<P>If I've kill'd a man I cou'd weep for it; but the price of blood shall never stain this hand</P>
<STAGE>(throws the purse down on the ground)</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Zeb.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cou'd cry myself for poor Crumpy—but give me the purse, for finding you wanted to get rid of him, to oblige your Highness, 'twas I that kill'd him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doct.</SPEAKER>
<P>You! Begar it was I dat did de murder him, to please you, my Lord, vid von grande kick of my fist I did give him de fine knock, a tumble down my tree pair of stair; and den I did drop his body down your chimney—so give de money—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cross-Leg.</SPEAKER>
<P>To me <STAGE>(holds out his hand)</STAGE> for with a fish bone, at my house, I gave him the fatal Cluck!—Cluck! <STAGE>(mimicks)</STAGE>—and that I might be sure of his being kill'd, I brought him to the Doctor's.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jug.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye; but who went to the market to buy that fish? My Lord, on the word of a woman, 'twas I that put the very bone on his plate that stuck in his throttle!—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bassa.</SPEAKER>
<P>So the reward has extorted a confession I wanted, and convicted you all of intentional murder from your own lips—Guards seize them—In reality his death grieves me, and the man that extracts the bone, and restore's the life of my poor favourite, shall have the purse I promis'd.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Crumpy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then that man am I <STAGE>(puts his hand to his mouth and takes out the bone)</STAGE> lay the cash here</P>

<P>A frolick; ha! ha! ha!—I've suffer'd this delicate little body of mine to be lug'd, thumpt, jum∣bled and tumbled all night, only to make a laugh for you this morning—and if you don't laugh, egad, you yourself in future for Crumpy!</P>

<P>Why, by Mahomet, it has been a laughable night's frolick indeed!—but all, but the honest En∣glishman, whose truth was above hope of reward or fear of punishment, shall die.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Crumpy.</SPEAKER>
<P>I Sieur Crumpy, Lord Chief Justice Joker, swear upon my hunch and honour, that nobody shall die, except Zebede the Jew, Quinquina the Doctor, Cross-Leg the Taylor, and Dame Juggy his ortho∣dox spousy.</P>

<P>You began your Chris∣tianity by robbing your uncle—justice, my Lord, on this!</P>

<SPEAKER>Crumpy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Stop; well remembered!—the barber and I here have yet two promises to claim; one is, that you'll give the purse to the generous Englishman, to give to me when I refuse next to drink with him—the other, that you'll repeal the law against the Christians—and the other—</P>

<P>Be quiet—this is the best of all—that you'll hang Zebede and the Doctor, if they don't give their consent and capital fortunes to this worthy young couple.</P>

<P>Presuming on my friend, the Vizier's favour, I'll grant them.</P>

<P>I grant you shou'd—Christians, Turks, Jews, my seeming death has prov'd my kind master wou'd mourn my worthless life! and when I cease to wish my Prince may live long and merrily, may I be choak'd with a whalebone.</P>
<L>All noble chops in princely Bagdad,</L>
