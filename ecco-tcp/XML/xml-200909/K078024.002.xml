will be ever ready to give it the first place as a British Papilio, and to those a figure of the Caterpillar and Chrysalis will be an ac∣ceptable acquisition. It derives the title of Purple High Flyer, as it very rarely descends to the ground; except in some few instances, it has never been taken but in the most elevated situations, and even those instances have been after a strong wind, or heavy rain: The tops of the loftiest forest trees afford it an asylum, and in the Caterpillar and Chrysalis state, it is preserved from the wanton cruelty of man, by the almost inaccessible height of its habitation. They feed on the Sallow, <HI>salix caprea,</HI> and the Caterpillars are obtained by beating the branches of the tree with a pole twenty or thirty feet in length; it is then but a necessary precaution to cover the ground beneath with large sheets to a certain distance, or the insects which fall, will be lost among the herbage.</P>
<P>It is in Caterpillar about <HI>May</HI> and <HI>June;</HI> it passes to the Chrysalis state, and in <HI>July</HI> or <HI>August</HI> is a Papilio.</P>
<P>The great difficulty and trouble to rear the Caterpillars, when found; and greater difficulty to take the Fly, has stamped a valuable consi∣deration on it, and particularly so when fine, and a high price is but esteemed an adequate compensation for it if in good preservation. The male is smaller, but more beautiful than the female; the upper side of the wings of the female not being enriched with that vivid change of purple which the male possesses in such an eminent degree; but the underside of the female is far richer in the various teints of colour than the male: they are both beautifully spotted, mottled, and waved with brown, black, white, and orange. The Chrysalis is of a very delicate texture, much resembling thin white paper, and is tinged in several parts with a very lively purple hue which it borrows from the wings of the enclosed insect, and bears the characteristic mark of a Papilio, by being suspended from the tail, with the head downward.</P>

<DIV3 TYPE="description">
<P>Many species of the <HI>Cimex</HI> genus differ so materially in their ge∣neral form, that very nice attention is necessary to discriminate the species which evidently belong to this extensive family. The external appearance of the House, or Scarlet Bug, cannot intimate the con∣nection to the same genus with this slender bodied insect; but so they are arranged by Linnaeus, and so they will appear on a proper inspec∣tion of those parts which constitute their generic character.</P>
<P>The present species is common, and may be taken during great part of the warm seasons. We have an Insect of the same genus <HI>(Cimex Lacustris)</HI> which has frequently attracted notice by the va∣riety and activity of its motions, when sporting on the surface of stagnant pools, or other standing water: It appears to fly, or skim the surface, but its wings are not often expanded, the lightness of its body
<PB N="6" REF="7"/>
and length of its legs, permitting it to dart with great velocity in any direction, and when it alights, it causes only a gentle tremulous motion beneath it. Its habits have much affinity to the generality of aquatic insects, and being constantly found on that element, would almost determine it to be of that race; but it is rather amphibious, and very rarely descends beneath the surface. It will at intervals rest for several minutes motionless on the water, its six legs are then ex∣panded, and the tarsi of the feet only touch the surface; but the <HI>Cimex Stagnorum</HI> is remarkable for the regularity and carefulness of all its actions; it rarely runs, but treads the water, slow, and ever appears to apprehend danger; it frequently pauses suddenly, and if it then perceives any thing disagreeable, retires. Aquatic Insects are generally supplied at several parts of their body with an oily matter that the water can∣not penetrate, and the legs of this Insect is apparently possessed of that property.</P>

<P>The history of those several insects so nearly resemble each other, that one general account will comprise all that can be said of any of the species. The larva is not unlike the adult insect, though its body js longer and tapering, and it hath no shells to defend it if in danger; its security therefore depends on its feet, which are rather longer, or at least appear longer, than in the after-state; all the species, whether as the larva or the adult, commonly feed on grass, but they as frequently are taken on the plantain, thistle and rose, or any other plant, whether wild or cultivated. They fasten themselves to the leaves of any plant that is near when they enter the Chrysalis state, and its appearance is then as if it were tied to the leaf by threads which pass each other in trans∣verse directions; they remain only a few days in the Chrysalis, as it undergoes but little change. May, June, and July, or later if the weather should prove fine, is the time to find them; many of the species are so numerous in almost every situation, that collectors give little trouble to obtain them, or at least search for such only as are most uncommon.</P>

<P>Ichneumons are the most voracious of all the winged Insects;—in their nature, robust and powerful, and armed with a formidable sting; they are the dread, and destroyer of other tribes, and mortal enemies to each other; like the animal <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Ichneumon is a well known animal in Egypt, particularly near the river Nile, and are useful for destroying the Eggs of the Crocodile, &amp;c.</NOTE> whence their significant appellation is derived, they exist by rapine and plunder, and support their infant offspring on the vitals of larger Insects.</P>
<P>The female Ichneumon, when ready to lay her eggs, is seen eagerly rushing from one plant to another, if its prey offers, which is generally the Larva of the <HI>Phalaena, Papilio,</HI> &amp;c. it darts down with the fero∣city of an eagle, and grasps the tender body in its claws; it is now in vain that the unwieldy animal attempts resistance, as all its efforts are but the sport of a savage conqueror. For raising the body almost upright, or into the form of a bow, the creature returns it in an in∣stant, and dashes the sting up to the base, in the softest part of the ca∣terpillar's body; this, if undisturbed, it will repeat thirty or forty times, always choosing a fresh spot for every new wound, and often entirely scarifying the Insect. The stung animal refuses to eat, and sometimes its illness terminates in its death, though generally the eggs are ma∣tured, and the Insects produced from the living body, so that if it survives its misery, and the wounds heal, the heat of the body ripens the embryos, and the young Ichneumons gnaw, and tear large passages through the body, to complete their delivery. July and August are the Months those species we have described are on the wing.</P>

<P>It is by no means for the beauty, but singularity of this creature that we have given it a place in our present selection. If it is too perfect for the larva of an Insect, it certainly appears too imperfect for the adult state; it has shells, but cannot fly, and their length compared with the proportion of the body contributes much to its awkward ap∣pearance. It is very quick-sighted, and runs with swiftness when in danger. After death the body is considerably contracted, and the native brilliancy of colour it possessed while living immediately va∣nishes. When touched, a brown liquor oozes from the sides.</P>
<P>We have several species of the Meloe differing in size, colour, and proportion; the <HI>Meloe Proscarabeus</HI> is the most common, at least near London.

<DIV3 TYPE="description">
<P>In Plate 24 of this work we have represented the LIBELLULA DEPRESSA in the winged state, and our present Figure is, of the Larva of that Insect. We have before described it as a savage vora∣cious creature in every state of its existence. The Larva, which is an aquatic, feeds on Insects of that element; and when it becomes adult, Moths, Butterflies, and other winged Insects are its prey. As Lepidopterous Insects are not provided with any weapons, defensive or offensive, it will encounter the largest, grasp them in its claws, and tear them to pieces. Its mouth is spacious, and well adapted for that purpose.</P>
<P>The Larvae of most winged Insects pass to the Aurelia, or Chrysalis state, and thence produce the Fly; but the Larvae of the <HI>Libellulae</HI> never undergoes that change, and though its appearance is altered several times in its progress to perfection, it does not become dormant. When the ultimate period of its last change arrives, it crawls to the bank, or side of the ditch, and affixing its legs firmly to the ground, or grass, it collects all its strength, and by one violent effort the fu∣ture between the Thorax and Abdomen is broken, whence the Head and Thorax is protruded; after some pause the exuvia is cast off, and the Wings, which were before enwrapped in the short cases at the bottom of the Thorax, expand. The creature now entirely formed for flight, only waits a short time to exhale the superfluous moisture, and then rushes into the air, to spread havoc and disorder.</P>

London it has been sought with most success in the Battersea Fields, or on those banks which abound with aquatic plants, between Battersea and Richmond; the marshes in the vicinity of Deptford and Rother∣hithe have been yet more productive; we do not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>owever understand that any have been taken this season about the metropolis.</P>
<P>The very singular manner in which this Caterpillar constructs its web, deserves particular notice: previous to its transformation from the <HI>Larva</HI> to the <HI>Aurelia,</HI> it quits the tender plants which afford nou∣rishment, and retires to those, better calculated for its protection, in its defenceless state; its choice is generally the Scirpus Lacustris <HI>(Bull Rush),</HI> or the stoutest plant that is near, if its leaves are rushy and strong. Its first process is to make a deep incision across the leaf, which it effects with little labour, as its mouth is well armed for the purpose; the upper part of the leaf being thus deprived of its support, instantly becomes dependent; the Caterpillar embraces the two sur∣faces of the fractured leaf, and weaves its web between. The web is of an exquisite texture and whiteness, and bears great resemblance to the webs of some spiders that frequent watery places.</P>

<P>The Genus <HI>Tipula,</HI> comprises an extensive family of the Dipterous Order, or of such Insects as are furnished with two Wings only. Our largest Species are <HI>Tip.</HI> Rivosa, Crocata, Lunata, &amp;c. the most com∣mon is <HI>T.</HI> Oleracea, generally known by the trivial appellations, <HI>Long Legs, Old Father,</HI> &amp;c. It is, as are also the other Species, perfectly harmless and inoffensive; yet their singular form, and more particularly the extraordinary disproportion of their legs, operates frequently to their disadvantage with the ignorant, who readily suppose they have to avoid, the secreted sting, of whatever appears aukward or uncommon.</P>
<P>Our smaller Species are infinitely more numerous, and many of them are not described, being so very minute as to remain unnoticed. The <HI>Tipula Plumosa,</HI> Plate XXII, differs materially in its general appear∣ance from the larger kinds.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="37"/>We rarely find a specimen of the larger kinds of Tipula with the legs complete; the loss of one or two of those members do not materially retard the briskness of its motions, but it cannot fly after suffering a total amputation, though it will then live a considerable time.</P>
<P>The Tipula Rivosa being entangled by two of its legs in the snare of a large spider [ARANEA DIADEMA], at first endeavoured to dis∣engage them by force, but this rather added to its calamity, and a third leg was attracted by the glutinous matter on the threads; the spider approached, and the creature accelerated its escape by leaving its legs in the web. It is very common to observe the broken limbs of the <HI>Tipulae</HI> in the snares of this species of spider.</P>
<P>The Larvae of many Tipulae, more especially the very minute sorts, are found in standing water, but the larger, generally feed on the roots of grass, and may be found by turning up the light surface of the earth. The Tipula Rivosa is taken in May and June, the Tipula Crocata in June and July; the latter is observed in the flower-garden or orchard.</P>

<P>The Genus <HI>Aranea</HI> includes a vast, if not endless variety of species, and though the greatest dissimilarity may be observed as to size, pro∣portion, or colouring, of many individual kinds, yet the rapaciousness
<PB N="34" REF="40"/>
common to the family, is apparent in all. Our domestic Spiders are plain in their colours, and seldom attain a very extraordinary size; the gardens are infested by species somewhat larger, and more lively in their marks and teints, but if we wish to trace the just gradations of the beauty, or size, of those detestable creatures, the forests abound; and will afford the highest gratification to the enquiries of the naturalist. We have Spiders purely white, or white stained with a lovely green; yellow, marked with a vivid red; purples shaded with the richest hues, and the brightest browns, bespangled with the utmost elegance and symmetry: Yet under those rich adornments which nature has so pro∣fusely bestowed on this complication of beauty, and ferocity, we dis∣cover inherent qualities, which, in larger animals, would become formidable, and though we feel confident of our superiority over the insidious art of such a contemptible creature, yet the mind is suscepti∣ble of an inward abhorrence at its touch, which neither the expansion of philosophy, or ignorance of its disposition, will sometimes suppress. It is probable, that <HI>Thomson,</HI> in his description of the Spider, felt this sympathy of the human mind,
<Q><L>"—To heedless flies the window proves</L>
<L>A constant death; where, gloomily retired,</L>
<L>The villain Spider lives, cunning and fierce,</L>
<L>Mixture abhorr'd! Amid a mangled heap</L>
<L>Of carcases, in eager watch he sits,</L>
<L>O'er-looking all his waving snares around.</L>
<L>Near the dire cell, the dreadless wanderer oft</L>
<L>Passes, as oft the ruffian shews his front;</L>
<L>The prey at last ensnar'd, he dreadful darts</L>
<L>With rapid glide along the leaning line;</L>
<L>And fixing in the wretch his cruel fangs,</L>
<L>Strikes backward grimly pleas'd: the flutt'ring wing,</L>
<L>And shriller found declare extreme distress,</L>
<L>And ask the helping hospitable hand."</L></Q></P>
<P>Early in the spring we find the nests of Spiders in the crevices of old walls, trees, and other obscure places. They are enclosed in webs of a white, yellow, or grey colour, varying according to the
<PB N="35" REF="41"/>
species; immediately that the warmth of the sun has hatched them, they disperse, it being no longer necessary to live in societies, which indeed, would deprive some of their subsistence.</P>
<P>In February we took a nest of minute yellowish eggs, which proved to be the infant offspring of the A. Diadema, they scarcely exceeded the size of a pin's head when hatched, and were of a bright yellow colour; at first their food was the common house fly, but their increase in bulk was so rapid that it was necessary to destroy many, to preserve a few; we therefore selected four specimens, which being fed in separate glasses, and on different insects, exhibited each a distinct degree of strength, and colour. One specimen destroyed thirty of the common house fly in a day; it then appeared much enlarged, and the colours were almost black, except the spots of white, which sparkled with infinite lustre; but being confined a week without a fresh supply, its colours were considerably faded; another week of abstinence reduced its colours to a pale uniform brown, the body was much wasted, and the creature became perfectly ravenous. It devoured a vast quantity of food, and recovered much of its former colours a few hours after.</P>
<P>Our largest Spiders are incomparable for their size, or venomous qualities, to the productions of America, or of the eastern countries; in Germany they are far superior in size to our specimens, but in Surinam they are infinitely surpassed, Spiders of those parts being often found with legs as thick as a goose-quill, and three or four inches in length, which with difficulty support a body as large as a pullet's egg. Their snares are commonly extended from one branch of a tree to another, covering the space of twenty or thirty feet, and is suffi∣ciently strong to entangle the largest insects. A. Seba has figured a Spider of this description, as descending from an arm of a tree, into the nest of a small species of Humming Bird, to suck the blood of the parent, and eggs.</P>
<P>"The eyes of the Spider are a very beautiful microscopic object, viewed either as transparent or opake; they have generally eight, two on the top of the head, that look directly upwards; two in the front, a little below the foregoing, to discover what passes before it; and on each side a couple more, one whereof points sideways forward, the other sideways backward; so that it can see almost all around it. They are immoveable, and seem to be formed of a hard, transparent, horny sub∣stance. The number of eyes is not the same in all the species of the
<PB N="36" REF="42"/>
Spider. They have eight legs, with six joints, thickly beset with hairs, and terminating in two crooked moveable claws, which have little teeth like a saw; at a small distance from these claws, but placed higher up, is another, somewhat like a cock's spur, by the assistance of which it adheres to it's webs; but the weapon wherewith it seizes and kills its prey is a pair of sharp crooked claws, or forceps, placed in the fore-part of the head. They can open or extend these pincers as occasion may require; when undisturbed they suffer them to lie one upon another. Mr. <HI>Lewenhoeck</HI> says, that each of these claws has a small aperture, or slit, through which he supposes a poisonous juice is injected into the wound it makes.</P>
<P>"The exuvia of the Spider, which may be found in cobwebs, be∣ing transparent, is an excellent object; and the fangs, or forceps, may be easier separated from it, and examined with more exactness than in a living Spider. The contexture of the Spider's web, and their man∣ner of weaving them, have been discovered by the microscope. The Spider is supplied with a large quantity of glutinous matter within it's body, and five dugs, or teats, for spinning it into thread. This substance, when examined accurately, will be found twisted into many coils, of an agate colour, and which, from its tenacity, may be easily drawn out into threads. The five teats are placed near the extremity of its tail; from these the aforesaid substance proceeds; it adheres to any thing it is pressed against, and being drawn out, hardens in the air. The Spider can contract or dilate at pleasure the orifices through which the threads are drawn. The threads unite at a small distance from the body, so that those which appear to us so fine and single, are notwithstanding composed of five joined together, and these are many times doubled when the web is in formation."</P>

<P>Caterpillars that enter the earth in the larva form, pass to the chrysalis, and issue forth in the perfect or Fly state, have no occasion for a web to protect them; and therefore few species prepare one.

<P>The Female deposits her eggs in the crevices of such twigs as are hollow; and a peculiar instinct almost invariably directs her to the stalks of the currant trees: which are not only easy of access, but afford grateful nourishment to the young brood. Immediately that the Caterpillar is enlarged from the egg, it perforates the stalk, and, hav∣ing entire possession of the inner channel, it feeds on the soft substance which is abundant within. Thus it is secured by nature, with a de∣fence against many depredators, to which all Caterpillars, except in∣ternal feeders, are exposed.</P>
<P>It changes to a Chrysalis within the stalk.</P>
<P>A short time before the Insect bursts forth, the Chrysalis is pro∣truded through the outer bark, precisely in the same manner as the Chrysalis of the <HI>Sp.

<P><HI>Cicada Spumaria</HI> is not only common in this country, but is abun∣dant in every part of Europe. It frequents most plants, but those especially which exhale much moisture. The food of the Larva ap∣pears entirely of the vegetable kind, and consists, for the most part, of the superabundant fluids which all plants transpire.</P>
<P>"The CUCKOW-SPIT, or FROTH-WORM, is often found hid in that frothy matter which we find on the surface of plants. It has an oblong, obtuse body; and a large head, with small eyes. The ex∣ternal Wings, for it hath four, are of a dusky brown colour, marked with two white spots: the head is black. The spume in which it is found wallowing, is all of its own formation, and very much resembles frothy spittle. It proceeds from the vent of the animal, and other parts of the body; and, if it be wiped away, a new quantity will be quickly seen ejected from the little animal's body. Within this spume, it is seen in time to acquire four tubercles on its back, wherein the wings are enclosed: these bursting, from a reptile it becomes a winged animal."</P>
<P>The colour of the winged Insect is found to vary from a deep cho∣colate, to a very pale brown. It is taken in July and August.</P>
<P>It rarely uses its wings for flight, as the hind legs are formed for leaping; at one effort it will frequently bound to the distance of two or three yards.</P>

<P>A very beautiful species of the <HI>Papilio;</HI> and, were it less frequent, would be infinitely esteemed for the elegant combination of its co∣lours; but is at present little regarded. The old Flies are observed in May, the Caterpillars are hatched about the middle of June; in July they are full fed, and cast their last exuviae: they transform into Chry∣salis, in which state they remain only fifteen days, and then burst forth a Papilio.</P>
<P>They continue to breed in vast quantities during the warm weather; and have, if the season be favourable, several broods before the winter.</P>
<P>The Chrysalis is brown, but often assumes much of a golden hue; and, though not its common appearance, is sometimes seen entirely of a rich gilded, or gold colour; but this is unnatural, and generally indicates that the Caterpillar has been stung by the Ichneumon Fly. The Caterpillars are taken on the Nettle <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Urtica Dioica. Linn.</HI></NOTE>.</P>

size, are to be seen in almost every cabinet; but that the species should have escaped the researches of the most eminent collectors, is rather astonishing.</P>
<P>We have sought every information which our connection would permit; and from the result we scarcely hesitate to pronounce the insect of a nondescript species, and our specimen to be perfectly unique; at least it is a newly-discovered acquisition to many scientific entymologists.</P>

<P>An insect so singularly marked, cannot readily be confounded with any other species, as we do not possess one which bears much resem∣blance to it; the most striking particular for a specific distinction are the two waved lines of white on the superior wings, which being con∣trasted with the brown colour, gives it a very unusual appearance.</P>
<P>It is an undescribed insect, and we have called it Phalaena Interroga∣tionana, as the white undulated mark, if viewed sideways, resembles a note of interrogation.</P>

<P>Pha. Semi-argentella is without exception one of the most brilliant little moths we have; the natural size is scarcely sufficient to display its superior elegance, but when examined by the microscope, imagi∣nation cannot paint a more resplendent object, for we instantly discover a most wonderful combination of all the varied shades of molten silver and burnished gold; its superior wings are entirely adorned with plates which exhibit in one view the appearance of those costly metals, but vary with every direction of light; that which appears gold in one point of sight becoming red, or bright orange, while the shades which were before of a dark brown, assumes the resplendence of burnished gold; the thorax glitters with the same splendor; the head, antennae, and even the legs, partake also of this rich colouring in some changes of light; the inferior wings are of a very delicate texture, grey colour, changeable, and though comparatively small, are surrounded by a deep fringe, which gives them the appearance of proportion.</P>
<P>We are unacquainted with the works of any author that contain a figure of this insect, or we might perhaps be enabled to determine

whether it is not the <HI>Pha. T. Seppella</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Alis auratis, strigis duabus argenteis. <HI>Gen. Ins. Mant.</HI> 296.</NOTE> of Fabricius; the descriptions nearly correspond, but we are unwilling, without other proof, to give it that specific name.</P>

The body is large in proportion to the other parts, but after death it is so contracted, or distorted from its natural shape, as to assume the appearance of an incoherent mass; the skin so co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rugated as to receive a false light on different parts of the surface, and consequently the natural glow of

<P>The underside, from the greater tenacity of the skin, or shelly sub∣stance, is less liable to alteration than the upper side; it is entirely of a dark, but beautiful purple, which is changeable in proportion to the convexity of the body, to the most brilliant hues; the legs are also of a beautiful purple, with the appearance of bronze or copper colour intermixed.</P>
<P>It does not appear to be frequent in any part of Europe; even in Germany it is rarely, if ever taken: as one of the <HI>British Coleopterae</HI> it is very little known, and is perhaps confined to the distant parts of Kent, where it is not generally diffused, but is found local to certain situations.</P>
<P>Mr. Crow, of Feversham, very fortunately met with a brood of them last season, and transmitted several specimens to his friends in London. They varied considerably in several respects, and particularly in their colours; some appearing much more beautiful than others.</P>
<P>The male is smaller than the female; they secrete themselves be∣neath the surface of the earth, and subsist on the roots of grass, or herbage in general: are sometimes found by turning up the mould, or may be observed crawling among the grass. Come forth in April, or May.</P>

<P>This species is found in every part of Europe, though very scarce; and in England it is extremely rare.</P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="115"/>And it is no less distinguished for the very singular structure and length of its antennae, than for its rarity; that part which forms one of the most certain characteristics of almost every tribe of Insects, constitutes the most prominent character in this.</P>
<P>Of its use, we are altogether ignorant, as the various opinions that have been given by former writers are now obliterated; some have supposed that they were the organs of hearing, or smell; and others have imagined that they were susceptible of the least motion in the ambient fluid in which they move.</P>
<P>Geoffroy discovered the organs of hearing in several amphibious animals, viz. in the toad, frog, viper, some other serpents, lizard, water-salamander, and skate <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Memoires Etrangers de l'Acad. de Paris, 1755.</NOTE>; and many of the most eminent ana∣tomists of the present time have discovered by their researches into the animal kingdom, those organs in different creatures. Profes∣sor Camper, in 1763, published remarks on the organs of hearing in fishes, in the Harlem Transactions <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">In the Year 1763, &amp;c.</NOTE>: Mr. Hunter has described others in the Philosophical Transactions <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Vol. lxxii.</NOTE>; and Dr. Monro has de∣scribed and figured great variety of them in his large work on the structure and physiology of fishes.</P>
<P>Probably, induced by those discoveries professor Fabricius endea∣voured to ascertain the organs of hearing in Insects also; and about nine years ago published an account of this interesting discovery in the New Copenhagen Transactions <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Vol. ii. p. 375.</NOTE>, with figures of those organs in the crab and lobster: he found the external orifice of the organ in these animals to be placed between the long and the short antennae, the cochlea, &amp;c. being lodged in the upper part, which Linnaeus calls the thorax, near the base of the serrated projection at its apex; we must therefore conclude that the antennae of Insects are appropriated for some other purposes than those it is at present suspected they answer.</P>
<P>The Cerambyx Aedilis, Fabricius informs us, lives in the trunks of trees; its horns are moveable, as it can either direct them forward, or support them in an erect position; and when it sleeps, it reclines them along its back; it also reclines them when it walks quick, or has to pass through a narrow track, as the least resistance from any thing in its way, would be very liable to injure, or break them off.</P>
<P>Our specimen was taken in May.</P>
