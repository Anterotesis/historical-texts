<P>THE author of the following rhimes, hath too much neglected the muses, either to deserve or expect any great reputation as a poet. He hath ever set so little store, indeed, by his poetical per∣formances, as to be now able to procure copies of but few of those, which have occasionally dropt from his pen. It would be impertinent in him however, to affect to undervalue what he is obtruding on the publick; especially as most of the pieces contained in this collection have been frequently printed, and therefore may be presumed to have met with some approbation.</P>

<HEAD>TO A GENTLEMAN, WHO CENSURED THE AUTHOR FOR SCRIBBLING VERSES.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">WRITTEN IN THE YEAR MDCCLXV.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>YOU ask me, why I spend my time</L>
<L>In fruitless ribaldry and rhime,</L>
<L>On Criticks, Poets, Players?</L>
<L>The Ministers of State, you say,</L>
<L>Would gladly take me into pay;</L>
<L>And none so good as theirs.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="2" REF="7"/>
<L>I thank ye, —but I've had to do</L>
<L>With Ministers, as well as you,</L>
<L>And know they're wond'rous civil;</L>
<L>They'll promise places for your pains,</L>
<L>But care not, when they've suck'd your brains,</L>
<L>If you were at the devil.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Did war, or rude rebellion, shake</L>
<L>The court, and make the city quake,</L>
<L>I then my pen might draw:</L>
<L>Not in these piping times of peace,</L>
<L>When wealth with taxes must increase,</L>
<L>And freedom's fix'd by law.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>I once, indeed, did such a thing,</L>
<L>To serve my country and my king,</L>
<L>And of my own accord,</L>
<L>A king, who had the grace and spirit</L>
<L>To know his friends, and loyal merit</L>
<L>Could liberally reward.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But since (for truth may dare be just)</L>
<L>False policy hath given disgust;</L>
<L>While Nature's powerful charms</L>
<L>Woo'd me, those hidden paths t'explore,</L>
<L>Which Locke and Newton trod before</L>
<L>And won me to her arms.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="3" REF="8"/>
<L>Not but, relaxing now and then,</L>
<L>Philosophy lays down the pen;</L>
<L>When pictures, poems, plays,</L>
<L>E'en musick's prostituted art,</L>
<L>Engage the eye, the ear, the heart;</L>
<L>Amusing various ways.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Meanwhile, an hour, I'd rather sit,</L>
<L>To look at Pritchard, from the pit,</L>
<L>Than kiss the papal toe;</L>
<L>Nay, rather than a monarch's hand,</L>
<L>For Garrick there would even stand</L>
<L>'Till I could hardly go.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>While thus amus'd, and thus employ'd,</L>
<L>Life wears away not unenjoy'd,</L>
<L>Tho' free from ill intention:</L>
<L>Good providence, but give me health,</L>
<L>I envy no man's wit or wealth,</L>
<L>Nor pine for place or pension.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Let others write to please the rabble,</L>
<L>In hopes some ministerial squabble</L>
<L>May pluck the fools a feather:</L>
<L>Believe me, I am no such fool,</L>
<L>Like —, to be made the tool,</L>
<L>Of knaves and fools together.</L>

<HEAD>FINE SIGHTS; OR THE COUNTESS OF C—Y, IN ELYSIUM.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">WRITTEN IN THE YEAR MDCCLX.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>ON the banks of the Styx, as a beautiful ghost,</L>
<L>In resemblance the shade of the Goddess of Love,</L>
<L>Was revolving the days, when a countess and toast</L>
<L>She flaunted about in the regions above.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>News arriv'd, which soon made all Elysium to ring,</L>
<L>That the Fates a great monarch had summon'd to rest,</L>
<L>In calling Old England's late father and king</L>
<L>To a crown of reward in the realms of the blest.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>My lady was vex'd to be robb'd of th' occasion,</L>
<L>By dying before him so mal-a-propos,</L>
<L>Of seeing his royal young heir's coronation;</L>
<L>And making a party herself in the show.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>She therefore in haste skipt away to the ferry,—</L>
<L>"Here, Charon, you're empty, come take over me;</L>
<L>"I'm resolv'd to go back to the world in your wherry,</L>
<L>"The only fine sight I e'er miss'd of, to see."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="5" REF="10"/>
<L>Old Charon most civilly bow'd to my lady;</L>
<L>Stept out of his wherry and handed her in;</L>
<L>But, finding she wanted a pass, was as ready,</L>
<L>Her ladyship roughly to turn out again.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then skudding away to the court in a hurry,</L>
<L>Direct, for a passport, to Pluto she ran;</L>
<L>And put madam Proserpine into a flurry,</L>
<L>Who thought she was come to seduce her good man.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Gloomy Dis grimly smil'd at the lady's request,</L>
<L>But more at her whimsical motive and reason;</L>
<L>And, having malignly a mind for a jest,</L>
<L>Represented her suit as a thing out of season.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>I cannot, said he, lady fair, with a frown,</L>
<L>Indulge ev'ry ghost in it's wanton desire,</L>
<L>But if for their sakes, wife or husband come down,</L>
<L>I then might restore the fond souls they require.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Since Orpheus, however, in risk of his life,</L>
<L>Long ago made us stare with his musick and passion,</L>
<L>Not a soul hath come down, or for husband or wife;</L>
<L>So that journies of this kind are quite out of fashion.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="6" REF="11"/>
<L>Yet, as you're a beauty, the favour I grant ye;</L>
<L>But wherefore again should you covet on earth,</L>
<L>To mix with a crowd, that perhaps only want ye</L>
<L>To make you the theme of impertinent mirth?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Besides, pretty lady, you're greatly mistaken,</L>
<L>If pleasure you promise yourself in the sight;</L>
<L>For, unseen by your friends, by admirers forsaken,</L>
<L>There's none will regard an impalpable spright.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Nay, nay, quoth the countess, if that be the case,</L>
<L>Take your passport again; I'll have no more chagrin;</L>
<L>A fig for fine sights, if unseen one's fine face;</L>
<L>What signifies seeing if one is not seen?</L>

<HEAD>AN EPISTLE TO MR. GARRICK, ON THE REPORT OF HIS HAVING LEFT THE STAGE.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">WRITTEN IN THE YEAR MDCCLXV.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>SO! Mr. Garrick! is it true,</L>
<L>As folks report, the stage and you</L>
<L>Took a French leave, at parting?</L>
<L>We hop'd th' Italian air and diet</L>
<L>Had quite restor'd your health and quiet,</L>
<L>And made you keen for starting.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In vain we listen'd to the tales</L>
<L>Brought over by the foreign mails,</L>
<L>That you were home returning;</L>
<L>To see your name in capitals,</L>
<L>Stuck up on tavern-posts, and walls.</L>
<L>With fond impatience burning!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Your wish'd arrival vain to boast,</L>
<L>If, never enter'd at the post,</L>
<L>You shun the race of glory!</L>
<L>As well you might have travell'd on,</L>
<L>From Pope to Turk, to Prester John:</L>
<L>The world was all before ye.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="8" REF="13"/>
<L>For to be plain Sir, entre nous,</L>
<L>'Twas not about your wife or you</L>
<L>We all were so solicitous:</L>
<L>You might as well be there as here,</L>
<L>If, as king Richard, Bayes, or Lear,</L>
<L>You mean no more to visit us.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Your friends, if friends they are, indeed,</L>
<L>Your spirit or your spleen may plead,</L>
<L>From acting to excuse ye;</L>
<L>But, spite of what your friends declare</L>
<L>We, your admirers, cannot bear</L>
<L>To get you thus to lose ye.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'Tis true, they make a mighty stir</L>
<L>About you, as a manager,</L>
<L>Intent on reformation;</L>
<L>Busy instructing, in their parts,</L>
<L>In clap-trap attitudes and starts,</L>
<L>The rising generation.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But ah! in vain removed from sight</L>
<L>The candles, to improve the light,</L>
<L>Tho' pleas'd the pit immensely!</L>
<L>If all your pupils need the rod</L>
<L>As much as fiddle-faddle—,</L>
<L>Or blustering, bouncing—.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="9" REF="14"/>
<L>To those, who ne'er have Garrick seen,</L>
<L>Such acting may not give the spleen:</L>
<L>To me, it is the devil,</L>
<L>To sit three hours, my noddle bare,</L>
<L>To see your—rant and tear,</L>
<L>And hear that—snivel!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>I, often as I come to town,</L>
<L>In order to spare you a crown,</L>
<L>Dine gratis, with my printer;</L>
<L>But, damn it, if I'm doom'd to see</L>
<L>Such mummers play, instead of thee,</L>
<L>I'll come no more this winter.</L>

<HEAD>ON THE INVESTIGATION OF TRUTH.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">AN EPISTLE TO LORENZO.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>TOO long have childish bards, too long,</L>
<L>Their hours employ'd in idle song;</L>
<L>Busied the lineaments to trace</L>
<L>Of wither'd Fiction's painted face;</L>
<L>Where not a native beauty blows,</L>
<L>But cankers eat the budding rose!</L>
<L>Yet, captive to her smiles and wit,</L>
<L>Pleas'd with their chains, her slaves have writ,</L>
<L>And all the labour'd pomp of verse</L>
<L>Employ'd, her fables to rehearse;</L>
<L>While thou, O sacred Truth! remain</L>
<L>The theme of ev'ry humbler strain.</L>
<L>And yet, believe what each pretends,</L>
<L>And num'rous are her rhyming friends!</L>
<L>While such her fond admirers prove,</L>
<L>And tune their rival songs to love.</L>
<L>But, fools in fondness as in awe,</L>
<L>The truth, 'tis plain, they never saw;</L>
<L>And but themselves her lovers boast,</L>
<L>Because her name the public toast;</L>
<L>Still playing a fictitious part;</L>
<L>No real passion at the heart.</L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="16"/>
For say, what lover's passion's true</L>
<L>For beauty that he never knew?</L>
<L>So eastern monarch's love their wives,</L>
<L>Tho' barren strangers all their lives.</L>
<L>So lov'd la Mancha's famous knight</L>
<L>The Fair, for whom he swore to fight;</L>
<L>Fir'd by th' enthusiastic rage,</L>
<L>With men and monsters to engage.</L>
<L>Yet ask'd, for whom this martial strife?</L>
<L>He never saw her in her life:</L>
<L>Nor was he positive, God wot,</L>
<L>Whether, indeed, she liv'd or not.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus bards too oft, in truth's defence,</L>
<L>Break through the rules of common sense;</L>
<L>And, o'er his rival, each, t' aspire,</L>
<L>Strives which shall prove the greatest liar:</L>
<L>Strange to the liberty of thought,</L>
<L>Vile slaves! but seeking to be bought,</L>
<L>To lying faction early train'd,</L>
<L>A purchase by the truth disdain'd.</L>
<L>Mean-time, as insolent as vain,</L>
<L>They freedom's sacred name profane,</L>
<L>And, boasting, hug the chains that bind</L>
<L>That worst of slaves, the servile mind,</L>
<L>Such, Dryden, thou immortal bard,</L>
<L>Whose genius claims supreme regard;</L>

How honour'd, might not truth accuse</L>
<L>Thy venal, prostituted muse.</L>

<L>Say'st thou 'tis strange the world should rest</L>
<L>Content, by falsehood thus depress'd?</L>
<L>Alas, thou little know'st mankind,</L>
<L>Who, seeing, imitate the blind;</L>
<L>In spite of truth and open day,</L>
<L>In darkness choose to grope their way;</L>
<L>Suspecting plainness of disguise,</L>
<L>The obvious sense of terms despise;</L>
<L>From sound or derivation gleaning</L>
<L>Some far-fetch'd, dark and doubtful meaning:</L>
<L>While each impostor's word prevails</L>
<L>In mystic parables and tales;</L>
<L>Neglected e'en the word divine,</L>
<L>If with it sense and reason join.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Look back through each successive age:</L>
<L>How honour'd the mysterious page!</L>
<L>What millions have been the tools</L>
<L>Of knaves, whose nat'ral prey is fools!</L>
<L>How strangely trick'd deluded crowds</L>
<L>Who, truth expecting from the clouds,</L>
<L>And therefore gaping into th' air,</L>
<L>On error stumbled unaware!</L>
<L>Thus an astrologer of old,</L>
<L>In learned history we're told,</L>
<L><PB N="13" REF="18"/>
Contemplating the milky way,</L>
<L>Neglected that before him lay;</L>
<L>And, led by wand'ring planets, fell,</L>
<L>Unluckily into a well.</L>
<L>Yet e'er with slander branding those</L>
<L>Who seek the naked truth t' expose,</L>
<L>Short-sighted mortals, in their pride,</L>
<L>Thus strive their ignorance to hide;</L>
<L>By holding all beyond their view</L>
<L>Beyond investigation too.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Lorenzo, our misfortune here</L>
<L>Th' effect of idleness and fear.</L>
<L>The sluggard shuns inquiry's task,</L>
<L>Because too great the pains to ask;</L>
<L>Stifling th' emotions of his breast,</L>
<L>T' indulge his lazy brains in rest.</L>
<L>A paradox, yet such the fact,</L>
<L>More fear to think than fear to act;</L>
<L>In thought, tho' danger we surmize,</L>
<L>In act while real danger lies.</L>
<L>In truth, my friend, 'tis sad to find</L>
<L>Hence rise the zeal of half mankind;</L>
<L>Religion but the compound vice</L>
<L>Of indolence and cowardice.</L>
<L>Ev'n pious christians, much I fear,</L>
<L>Are practically atheists here.</L>
<L><PB N="14" REF="19"/>
How deaf and blind to calls of grace</L>
<L>When nature wears a smiling face,</L>
<L>But when she frowns, in wild amaze</L>
<L>Look how th' affrighted cowards gaze!</L>
<L>When clouds drop fatness on the plains,</L>
<L>In mildly-soft descending rains;</L>
<L>In their due season harvests smile,</L>
<L>And plenty crowns the peasant's toil:</L>
<L>As nothing rare, as nothing new,</L>
<L>We take the blessing as our due.</L>
<L>For O! prosperity's a lot</L>
<L>At ease enjoy'd, with ease forgot.</L>
<L>In june's warm sun and april's shower</L>
<L>We trace not an almighty power:</L>
<L>Ingrates! so light of heav'n we make,</L>
<L>Nor think the hand that gives may take.</L>
<L>But ah! when threat'ning storms arise;</L>
<L>When thunders rattle through the skies;</L>
<L>When the tall mountain bows its head,</L>
<L>And earthquakes vomit up the dead;</L>
<L>Behold whole nations prostrate fall</L>
<L>Before the mighty God of all.</L>
<L>T' appease his anger now their care,</L>
<L>Lo, all is fasting, sighs and pray'r;</L>
<L>Till, the dread storm blown haply o'er,</L>
<L>They rise and revel as before,</L>
<L>Forget, or ridicule, the rod;</L>
<L>And laugh to scorn the fear of God.</L>
<L><PB N="15" REF="20"/>
Nor only mov'd when danger's nigh,</L>
<L>Our fears awake the gen'ral cry;</L>
<L>Imaginary scenes, alike,</L>
<L>The dastard soul with terror strike;</L>
<L>While to the coward's opticks seem</L>
<L>Light straws as each a giant's beam.</L>
<L>In honour thus of God above,</L>
<L>So weakly draw the cords of love;</L>
<L>While nature's groans, or fancy's fears,</L>
<L>Drive headlong down the vale of tears.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Lorenzo, wouldst thou freely trace</L>
<L>Whence grows a cowardice so base?</L>
<L>At th' early dawn of moral sense</L>
<L>Th' infatuation did commence;</L>
<L>And, propagated since by art,</L>
<L>We all have, more or less, a part.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ere hermit bald or pilgrim grey</L>
<L>Had worn the solitary way;</L>
<L>Ere yet the monk had told his beads;</L>
<L>Ere yet credulity or creeds;</L>
<L>To school, with sober Reason sent,</L>
<L>Young Genius to Experience went.</L>
<L>The latter, tho' as yet, 'tis true,</L>
<L>No wiser than the former two,</L>
<L>In charge the tender pupils took,</L>
<L>And with them read in Nature's book.</L>
<L><PB N="16" REF="21"/>
So pedagogues, unletter'd, use</L>
<L>No class of blockheads to refuse;</L>
<L>But gravely undertake t' explain</L>
<L>The arts themselves must first attain;</L>
<L>Sufficient if the master goes</L>
<L>Before his blundering pupil's nose.</L>
<L>Careful his vacant hours t' employ,</L>
<L>Now Reason prov'd a hopeful boy:</L>
<L>But Genius, insolent and wild,</L>
<L>By nature an assuming child,</L>
<L>A treach'rous memory his lot,</L>
<L>The little that he learn'd forgot;</L>
<L>Nor gave himself a moments pain</L>
<L>To con his lessons o'er again;</L>
<L>But, trusting to his forward parts,</L>
<L>Debauch'd with wit the sister-arts;</L>
<L>Who, yet unsettled, young and frail,</L>
<L>Enamour'd, listen'd to his tale;</L>
<L>And, since the cause of dire disputes,</L>
<L>Turn'd out abandon'd prostitutes:</L>
<L>By priest and prophet, once enjoy'd,</L>
<L>To basest purposes employ'd;</L>
<L>For ages past, their only use</L>
<L>To vitiate reason or traduce.</L>
<L>For this, Tradition foremost came,</L>

<L>Accordingly in numbers came,</L>

<L>Taught by Marcel himself to dance,</L>

<L>Rough Bruin, but as yet a cub,</L>

<L>Drown'd old Grimalkin, and in ire,</L>

<L>For, out of wantonness or spite,</L>
<L>In mischief lay his sole delight;</L>

<L>The maggots of a dancing bear,</L>
<L>To make the people hoot and stare;</L>

<L>He calls a blissful taste of heaven.</L>

<L>And his a mortal's bitter'st pains.</L>
<L>Pains which no aggravation know!</L>
<L>Yet, so comparative our woe,</L>
<L>Inflict them when Cleora's kiss,</L>
<L>Kind earnest of approaching bliss,</L>

<L>Lo, disappointment joins the curse,</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>Correct ideas let us gain.</L>
<L>Our sense of joy we owe to pain;</L>
<L>So strange a paradox is this!</L>
<L>And mis'ry to our sense of bliss;</L>

<LG>
<L>The tension of th'extended nerve,</L>

<L><PB N="78" REF="83"/>While such in tune, these sages say,</L>
<L>The smiling hours in concert play:</L>
<L>But if, in change, too lax or tense,</L>
<L>Health strikes no more the keys of sense:</L>
<L>But, tremblingly alive all o'er,</L>
<L>The tortur'd strings in discord roar:</L>
<L>While sickness, with her harpy claws,</L>
<L>Stranger to each harmonious pause,</L>
<L>Labours, benumb'd, the jarring strain,</L>
<L>That stuns our ear with deaf'ning pain.</L>
<L>Nor yet can health too oft repeat</L>
<L>Its musick, howsoever sweet;</L>
<L>While, by degrees, lo, ev'ry string,</L>
<L>Depriv'd of its elastic spring,</L>
<L>In gen'ral lassitude, full soon</L>
<L>The whole machine grows out of tune.</L>
<L>Should, also, passion, sense or art</L>
<L>Wind up too high the nervous part,</L>
<L>With noise the notes tumultuous tire;</L>
<L>Or breaking strings unman the lyre.</L>
<L>Of pain or pleasure on our frame</L>
<L>Th' effects, hence, frequently the same.</L>
<L>Thus, full of gladness or of grief,</L>
<L>In tears we find the same relief;</L>
<L>Alike the feeble nerve destroy</L>
<L>Exquisite pain, extatic joy.</L>
<L>The bandit, stretch'd upon the wheel,</L>
<L>Th' extreme of torture ne'er can feel;</L>
<L><PB N="79" REF="84"/>But, cruelty disarming, lies</L>
<L>Or dead to sense, or really dies.</L>
<L>So, rapture never meant to bless,</L>
<L>E'vn joy grows pain when in excess.</L>
<L>Indulg'd to print the burning kiss</L>
<L>On Chloe's lips, how fierce the bliss!</L>
<L>How keen the torture of her charms,</L>
<L>Caress'd, to pant within her arms,</L>
<L>Melting in fulness of desire,</L>
<L>Stretch'd on the rack of bliss, t'expire!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus constitutional, below,</L>
<L>Is all our bliss, is all our woe;</L>

<L>Like Persian monarchs, hardly known</L>

<L>Depos'd and sceptred in a day,</L>
<L>Pleasure begins its fickle reign,</L>

<L>When, as to cruel pain we bow,</L>
<L>Its rod grows light we know not how.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ah, cruel blow to human pride!</L>
<L>Is pain and pleasure thus allied,</L>
<L>That all the sweets of life grow sour</L>

<L>IN days of yore, when elves were seen,</L>
<L>By moon-light dancing on the green,</L>
<L>Leading in mystic steps their train,</L>
<L>O'er marshy mead or flow'ry plain;</L>
<L>A maiden with her milking pail,</L>
<L>Trip'd morn and eve across the vale;</L>
<L>Patty, the sweetest temper'd lass</L>
<L>That e'er beat dew-drop from the grass:</L>
<L>But nature, half unkind, had shed</L>
<L>Ill-natur'd influence on her head;</L>
<L>For oh! the cause of many a care!</L>
<L>Deep-tinted red the virgin's hair.</L>
<L>For sister nymphs she liv'd a jest,</L>
<L>And ne'er was kiss'd among the rest.</L>
<L><PB N="82" REF="87"/>Now so it chanc'd that by the mead</L>
<L>Where Patty's cows were us'd to feed,</L>
<L>There stood a mount, on verdant ground,</L>
<L>With daisies strew'd, and violets crown'd;</L>
<L>Round which had many a tim'rous swain,</L>
<L>Seen fairies sporting on the plain:</L>
<L>For under, as the story's told,</L>
<L>They dwelt in palaces of gold;</L>
<L>Safe in the bosom of the hill,</L>
<L>Where they convey'd themselves at will;</L>
<L>Or, when they pleas'd from thence could rise,</L>
<L>Invisible to mortal eyes.</L>
<L>By these the nymph was often seen,</L>
<L>With clear-starch'd coif so neat and clean,</L>
<L>Devoid of all that negligence,</L>
<L>That give the fairies just offence;</L>
<L>Who trace the house with critic eye,</L>
<L>Nor pass an unwash'd trencher by;</L>
<L>But pinch severe the careless maid,</L>
<L>For room unswept, or spoon mislaid.</L>
<L>They view in pity Patty's hair,</L>
<L>And take the virgin to their care.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now as at dusky eve the maid</L>
<L>Sat milking Mully in the shade,</L>
<L>Simkin, a sprite of neither sex,</L>
<L>That us'd old peevish maids to vex</L>
<L><PB N="83" REF="88"/>In flowing azure loosely drest,</L>
<L>A thin transparent gauze its vest;</L>
<L>Like that which now to us convey'd,</L>
<L>The modern females term a shade;</L>
<L>Astride a vapour dancing came;</L>
<L>A Will o'th' Wisp its mortal name.</L>
<L>The same which boys so often ken,</L>
<L>From distant lake or foggy fen;</L>
<L>A cloud of light that leads astray</L>
<L>Trav'llers, benighted on their way.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus over hill and dale, the maid</L>
<L>The well-designing Simkin led;</L>
<L>'Till twelve a clock, a solemn sound,</L>
<L>Rung, from a neighbouring village, round;</L>
<L>What time the nimble fairies tread</L>
<L>The maiden daisies of the mead,</L>
<L>Which scarcely bend beneath their weight,</L>
<L>So lightly trip their nimble feet.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>How blest the plain! thrice fertile soil,</L>
<L>On which the fairies deign to smile!</L>
<L>No barren spot can here be found,</L>
<L>No weed nor thistle curse the ground;</L>
<L>Nor here is heard the screech-owl's note,</L>
<L>Nor omen from the raven's throat;</L>
<L>But thrush and black-bird sweetly sing,</L>
<L>And the glad cuckoo hails the spring.</L>
<L><PB N="84" REF="89"/>Here too, the scented sweet-briar grows,</L>
<L>The woodbine wild, and wild the rose;</L>
<L>The king-cup smiles with brighter bloom,</L>
<L>Aud violets breathe more sweet perfume.</L>
<L>To such a spot, enchanted mead!</L>
<L>The sprightly elve doth Patty lead,</L>
<L>Now from his bounding steed alights,</L>
<L>And mixes 'mong his fellow sprights;</L>
<L>His bounding steed no more his care,</L>
<L>Directly vanish'd into air.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now, gentle Patty, in surprize,</L>
<L>Around her turns her wand'ring eyes.</L>

<L>Here stood a crowd in warm dispute,</L>
<L>About to form a birth-day suit;</L>
<L>And there in consultation sat</L>
<L>As many, modelling a hat;</L>
<L>Fast by, inspir'd by female love,</L>
<L>The spreading petticoat t' improve;</L>
<L>They met, and in debate were high,</L>
<L>Or is? —or is it not—a fly?</L>
<L><PB N="85" REF="90"/>Others, to greater deeds inclin'd,</L>

<L>The sprites, to all invention new,</L>
<L>Their slender fingers, dip in dew,</L>
<L>And fill with deeds unknown before,</L>
<L>Their tomes, the leaves of sycamore.</L>
<L>Hence are the lov'd of fairies taught,</L>
<L>And blest with ev'ry brilliant thought;</L>
<L>Who here peruse at early dawn,</L>

<L>A number more, at different toil,</L>

<L>But were it real, 'tis a fine example,</L>
<L>And of his taste, no doubt, a curious sample!</L>
<L>Because Dan Ovid's Jove, a filthy rake,</L>

<L>How ludicrous to see, altho in sport,</L>
<L>The fields of Cressy and of Agincourt</L>
<L>Scarce big enough t' admit a warriour's stride,—</L>
<L>Your heroes always straddle four feet wide,—</L>

<L>"The same the providential power,</L>

<L>"Softens the good man's casual woes;</L>
<L>"Abandons vice to fell despair;</L>

<L>"Opposing nature's righteous will,</L>

<L>So far, Lorenzo, I with thee,</L>

<L>That vice will leave a sting behind,</L>
<L>And virtue its reward shall find;</L>
<L>Yet all, with good St. Paul, confess</L>
<L>"Without a law we can't transgress."</L>
<L>Now nature's law is heaven's command;</L>

<LG>
<L>Lorenzo, state the matter clear.</L>
<L>Be pain and pleasure strangers here.</L>
<L>Strangers to pleasures and to pain,</L>
<L>What motives had we to complain?</L>
<L>Suppose we, then, in nature's plan,</L>
<L>T' exist th' antomaton of man,</L>
<L>Rising from senseless matter's arms,</L>
<L>Which perfect rest nor grieves, nor charms;</L>
<L>Should heaven a consciousness bestow,</L>
<L>Subject to good or ill below;</L>
<L>Not real pain or pleasure give,</L>
<L>But only make the form to live:</L>
<L>As yet from all reflection clear,</L>
<L>Unnerv'd by hope, unaw'd by fear,</L>
<L>Suppose to action thus consign'd</L>
<L>This naked, unaffected mind.</L>
<L>Lorenzo, with precision hence</L>
<L>Let us infer the consequence.</L>
<L>Ere yet existed moral ill,</L>
<L>The first sole agent was the will;</L>
<L>Reason without the pow'r to act,</L>
<L>To censure or advise a fact;</L>
<L>As from experience nought it knew,</L>
<L>Of good or bad, or false or true:</L>
<L><PB N="128" REF="133"/>For reason its conclusion draws</L>
<L>From similar effect and cause;</L>
<L>No instinct, faculty or sense,</L>
<L>Securing actual innocence,</L>
<L>That bids us virtue's steps pursue,</L>
<L>Or points to bliss it never knew:</L>
<L>Else giving reason bounteous heaven</L>
<L>Had also actual pleasure given:</L>
<L>This not suppos'd, —hence reason's use</L>
<L>Some known effect must introduce.</L>
<L>Now, as innate, if we maintain</L>
<L>A love of bliss and hate of pain,</L>
<L>Directed as the passions fir'd,</L>
<L>The will to pleasure first aspir'd;</L>
<L>The moral agent bound to chuse</L>
<L>From nature's most immediate views.</L>
<L>But, prone to censure and complain,</L>
<L>Suppose our first sensation pain;</L>
<L>Let pain or pleasure be attain'd,</L>
<L>Of both an equal sense was gain'd;</L>
<L>As the first tree of knowledge bore</L>
<L>Of good and evil equal store;</L>
<L>For when the mind one pleasure knew,</L>
<L>Its neutral state of rest withdrew;</L>
<L>Pleasure and pain, by contrast known,</L>
<L>Criteria of each other grown.</L>
<L>Hence felt th' initiated mind</L>
<L>The sting which pleasure left behind,</L>
<L><PB N="129" REF="134"/>And reason did to act commence</L>
<L>On th' information of the sense;</L>
<L>Still as the passions ebb and flow,</L>
<L>Now swoln with bliss, now sunk in woe,</L>
<L>Tracing the bounds, th' extremes between,</L>
<L>Of innocence, that golden mean.</L>
<L>But ah, the fluctuating tide</L>
<L>Of passion doth this mean deride:</L>
<L>Consistent only, 'tis confess'd,</L>
<L>With nature in a state of rest.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Here then from moral actions came</L>
<L>The necessary ill, we blame:</L>
<L>Running self-love, in full career,</L>
<L>Reason her guide not always near,</L>
<L>Her satisfaction oft pursuing,</L>
<L>Tho at her own and others' ruin.</L>
<L>Th' indulgence of the human will,</L>
<L>We hence presume is moral ill,</L>
<L>Whene'er from such indulgence flows</L>
<L>More pain than pleasure it bestows.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In guilt original involv'd,</L>
<L>Here see the wond'rous myst'ry solv'd.</L>
<L>To the first man no more confin'd</L>
<L>Than passions found in ev'ry mind,</L>
<L>Is, the plain cause of moral woe,</L>
<L>Sin, human frailty here below.</L>
<L><PB N="130" REF="135"/>Lorenzo, evil understood,</L>
<L>The die's reverse is moral good:</L>
<L>Whate'er more pleasure yields than pain <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Not, indeed, solely to the agent, but to mankind, or the moral world in general.</NOTE></L>
<L>The name of goodness doth obtain.</L>

<L>Unsatisfied, Lorenzo, yet,</L>
<L>Dost thou lost happiness regret?</L>
<L>Doth, from our plan of morals, seem</L>
<L>Still providence no perfect scheme,</L>
<L>Because, perplex'd with fear or pain,</L>
<L>Ev'n virtue covets bliss in vain?</L>
<L>Dost thou against the cause object?</L>
<L>"'Tis disproportion'd to th' effect,</L>
<L>"Thus in th' intemp'rance of the will</L>
<L>"To place the source of moral ill:</L>
<L>"Our passions but a nat'ral cause,</L>

<L>Must I repeat it o'er again?</L>
<L>From pleasure flows our sense of pain.</L>
<L>Dependent these as light and shade,</L>
<L>Thro life, each other's contrast made.</L>
<L>Whence, tho to moderation join'd</L>
<L>Content's serenity of mind,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="131" REF="136"/>
<L>While vice but sports with higher glee</L>
<L>To sink as low in misery,</L>
<L>Proportion'd to the guilty joy</L>

<L>Yet, on the whole, no abstract ill</L>
<L>Doth here confront th' eternal will;</L>

<L>But relative to human life.</L>

<L>Sayst thou indeed "if man confin'd</L>

<L>"But partially to rise, or fall,</L>
<L>"Why feels he misery at all?"</L>
<L>Another question answers this.</L>

<L>Claiming the world's regard, at most.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>As virtue here so vice depends.</L>
<L>Ourselves our guilt the most offends.</L>
<L>For know, proud man, no act of thine</L>
<L>Renders defective God's design:</L>
<L>No pow'r to human frailty given</L>
<L>To injure unpreventing heaven.</L>
<L>Presume not at so high a price</L>

<HEAD>ON THE IMMORTALITY OF THE SOUL.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">AN EPISTLE TO LORENZO.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>O Blind to truth, to science blind,</L>
<L>The skeptic tribe of human-kind!</L>
<L>Who doubt, Lorenzo, if our lot</L>
<L>Be here to die and be forgot,</L>
<L>Or if it prove our future fate</L>
<L>To know an intellectual state,</L>
<L>In death to perish, or to rise,</L>
<L>Immortal to our native skies.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Allur'd by wit to neither side,</L>
<L>Be reason our impartial guide;</L>
<L>Let us, Lorenzo, fairly weigh</L>
<L>What argument hath here to say.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Hast thou poor Dromio's sophisms got,</L>
<L>Who bids us vegetate and rot;</L>
<L>Man but a rank and useless weed?</L>
<L>Prove them alike, and 'tis agreed.</L>
<L>But the analogy of parts</L>
<L>Is all that's prov'd by skeptic arts.</L>
<L>Say that, "of vegetable race,</L>
<L>"We spread the root from place to place;</L>
<L><PB N="147" REF="152"/>"The lovely flow'r of beauty blows,</L>
<L>"Twin sister to the province rose,</L>
<L>"Allures at morn the gazing, eye,</L>
<L>"That ere the ev'ning sees it die."</L>
<L>Say, "years disrobe the mantled brow,</L>
<L>"As winter strips th' autumnal bough;</L>
<L>"The rough, rude blast to both unkind,</L>
<L>"Both perish by an eastern wind;</L>
<L>"Or, by the ax, untimely blow!</L>
<L>"Are laid their spreading honours low."</L>
<L>Admit, Lorenzo, this be true:</L>
<L>Go on,—the parallel pursue.</L>
<L>Say, "the tall elms, you stately row,</L>
<L>"Sweet transports of sensation know;</L>
<L>"When zephyrs kiss the lily's breast</L>
<L>"The lily's rapture be confess'd."</L>
<L>Say "the broad oak, when thunders roar,</L>
<L>"Fears till the thunder-storm be o'er;</L>
<L>"Conscious of doubt and dread by turns,</L>
<L>"Stands trembling as the forest burns;</L>
<L>"Alive, awake, to nature's laws,</L>

<L>"Grown old in wisdom as in years!"</L>
<L>Is this absurd? absurd indeed!</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="148" REF="153"/>
<L>To moral arguments dost run?</L>
<L>Here shall we end as we begun.</L>
<L>Sayst thou "the virtuous, when they die,</L>
<L>"In their own right ascend the sky;</L>
<L>"The wicked, here unpunish'd, go</L>
<L>"To torment in the world below;</L>
<L>"Heaven's justice else we should arraign,</L>
<L>"And prove the virtuous good in vain."</L>
<L>You take, my friend, for granted here,</L>
<L>What none by reason make appear;</L>
<L>That vice at God Almighty's hands</L>
<L>Eternal punishment demands;</L>
<L>While endless bliss beyond the skies</L>
<L>Justice bestows, as virtue's prize.</L>
<L>Justice! Lorenzo, what, my friend,</L>
<L>By justice dost thou here intend?</L>
<L>Her sword she holds; but say, what ails</L>
<L>The equilibrium of her scales?</L>
<L>How low the one, tho empty, lies,</L>
<L>To kick the beam while t' other flies!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Alas, I see by what compell'd;</L>
<L>In diff'rent mediums are they held;</L>
<L>One in material fluids buoy'd,</L>
<L>The other in a perfect void;</L>
<L>Weigh'd in eternity and time,</L>
<L>The punishment against the crime!</L>
<L><PB N="149" REF="154"/>Dare the self-righteous tribe to say,</L>
<L>That heaven's no more than virtue's pay,</L>
<L>While vice demerits endless woe?</L>
<L>Needs God a friend? fears God a foe?</L>
<L>Holding vindictive rage in store,</L>
<L>For his own sake, on man to pour?</L>
<L>O, No—unhurt th' Almighty cause,</L>
<L>Or kept, or broken, human laws.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Cease, then, presumption, to contend</L>
<L>That mortals heaven can so offend,</L>
<L>As at an infinite expence,</L>
<L>To answer a finite offence:</L>
<L>To pay the fine immortal made;</L>
<L>Which else they never could have paid.</L>
<L>The dying wretch tho tyrants cure,</L>
<L>But tortures longer to endure;</L>
<L>With nature cruelly at strife</L>
<L>When criminals are quit with life;</L>
<L>Can God, whose tender mercies flow</L>
<L>O'er all his varied works below,</L>
<L>Whose loving kindness all confess,</L>
<L>Whose name the distant nations bless;</L>
<L>Say, can this God, of boundless love,</L>
<L>Vengeful as earthly tyrants prove?</L>
<L>O shame, Lorenzo, shame to all</L>
<L>Who cruelty can justice call!</L>
<L><PB N="150" REF="155"/>Such argument, beside, is vain,</L>
<L>Unless the premises were plain;</L>
<L>Unless we first could make it clear,</L>
<L>That vice can ne'er be punish'd here;</L>
<L>That virtue must be ever blest,</L>
<L>For following but its interest;</L>
<L>Or that we truly could define</L>
<L>That justice mortals call divine.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>By metaphysicks dost thou strive</L>
<L>To keep the man in death alive?</L>
<L>Wouldst thou, set moral pleas aside,</L>
<L>The body from the soul divide?</L>
<L>Material that and born to die,</L>
<L>While this a native of the sky;</L>
<L>Objects that none can hear and see</L>
<L>Hence claiming immortality!</L>
<L>But, say, is thy corporeal claim</L>
<L>Laid to the matter, or the frame?</L>
<L>Is it the substance of the heart</L>
<L>Or make, that is the mortal part?</L>
<L>Doth change of form bring death alone?</L>
<L>Form we must immaterial own.</L>
<L>If to the essence of the clay,</L>
<L>Again, mortality we lay,</L>
<L>Doom'd the loath'd carcass to the worm,</L>
<L>The substance changes but its form:</L>
<L><PB N="151" REF="156"/>Through modes of being given to range,</L>
<L>Immortal in perpetual change,</L>
<L>Matter by all the skeptic crowd</L>
<L>Essentially the same allow'd;</L>
<L>In death, in life, our shame, our pride,</L>
<L>In various forms but modified.</L>
<L>Say, then, the matter or the frame,</L>
<L>Or both, in body have a claim;</L>
<L>Nor mortal, nor immortal, we</L>
<L>From our materiality.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Lorenzo, doth thy bosom beat,</L>
<L>To claim in heaven th' immortal seat?</L>
<L>So fond of thy existence here,</L>
<L>Dost thou annihilation fear?</L>
<L>To fall as undistinguish'd clay</L>
<L>To dumb forgetfulness a prey?</L>
<L>The joys of paradise in view,</L>
<L>Sayst thou "thy claim must needs be true,</L>
<L>"Else, wherefore doth thy fond desire</L>
<L>"To immortality aspire?"</L>
<L>Whate'er in hope be heaven's intent,</L>
<L>This is, my friend, no argument.</L>
<L>I, too, perhaps, so pleas'd to live,</L>
<L>My very means of life might give,</L>
<L>All I am worth, from death to save,</L>
<L>If hope were buried in the grave.</L>
<L><PB N="152" REF="157"/>But let Lorenzo never trust</L>
<L>To wish or hope, however just:</L>
<L>Nor let a passionate desire</L>
<L>To reason's sober task aspire.</L>
<L>Wouldst thou false principles defend,</L>
<L>Because they serve a pleasing end?</L>
<L>Who loves the truth will sure despise</L>
<L>Her cause to rest on specious lies.</L>
<L>What merit doth it add to worth</L>
<L>That knaves its virtues babble forth?</L>
<L>What added weight or consequence,</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>Again, is't said "so closely join'd</L>

<L>"In use of body or of mind."</L>
<L>Are there who weakly, hence, suppose</L>
<L>"The soul no sep'rate being knows;</L>
<L>"But, as the body doth decay,</L>
<L>"So wears the mortal mind away."</L>
<L><PB N="153" REF="158"/>Yet wherefore might not at our birth.</L>
<L>Lodg'd in this tenement of earth,</L>
<L>Lock'd up for life th' immortal mind,</L>
<L>Its temporary prison find,</L>
<L>Till paid our vital debt should be,</L>
<L>And death should set the captive free?</L>
<L>Mean-while, in hope, in fear, in doubt,</L>
<L>Concerning friends and foes without,</L>
<L>Prone thro its prison grates to pry,</L>
<L>It sees Time's scatter'd ruins lie,</L>
<L>In darkness and confusion hurl'd,</L>
<L>The embryo of another world.</L>
<L>Why may not thus, on earth, be join'd</L>

<L>Th'inhabitant, with cost and care,</L>

<L>When danger threats his tott'ring walls?</L>
<L>Nor strange, if, heedless.of their fate,</L>
<L>They tumble on his wareless pate;</L>
<L>Each other's mutual strength and ward,</L>
<L>The mansion and the mansion's lord.</L>
<L><PB N="154" REF="159"/>What tho we hold the soul to be</L>
<L>Attach'd to sensibility,</L>
<L>Concludes Lorenzo rashly hence</L>
<L>The soul's as mortal as the sense?</L>
<L>Alleging that "in life we find</L>
<L>"Perception to the organs join'd,</L>
<L>"Poor mortals of sensation void</L>
<L>"As these are damag'd or destroy'd;</L>
<L>"Therefore the soul on sense depends,</L>

<L>Lorenzo, thro a darken'd glass</L>
<L>Seest thou but faintly objects pass?</L>
<L>More darken'd yet, dost thou confess</L>
<L>Thy certainty of vision less?</L>
<L>With its transparency thy sight</L>

<L>Suppose it broke or let it fall,</L>
<L>Dost think thou couldst not see at all?</L>
<L>Ridiculous! when objects lie</L>
<L>All open to the naked eye.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus, may the soul, to body join'd,</L>
<L>Be deaf, irrational or blind:</L>
<L>But take th' obstructing organs hence,</L>
<L>At liberty its native sense,</L>
<L>By fits no more it hears and sees,</L>
<L>As now by piece-meal and degrees,</L>

<L>Now sense and science both combin'd</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>But here, Lorenzo, for a while</L>

<L>Doth Dromio say, to hold dispute,</L>

<HEAD>RALPH MOULSEY'S DESCRIPTION OF RICHMOND PLAYHOUSE.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>WHERE Hodge, ye great oaf, have you been,</L>
<L>That you ha'not yet been to the play?</L>
<L>The playhouse at Richmond I mean,</L>
<L>Which i'faith is most gallant and gay.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>We shew-folk have seen afore now</L>
<L>Enact kings and queens in a barn;</L>
<L>But this is a palace, I vow,</L>
<L>And a costly one too, as I learn.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>I star'd, as you'll think, all about,</L>
<L>To see such a wonderful thing;</L>
<L>But I found, when the secret came out,</L>
<L>'Twas design'd to be fit for the king.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>God bless'n, had he but been there,</L>
<L>And the queen, I'd ha' gi'n half a crown;</L>
<L>For they come not to wake nor to fair;</L>
<L>And 'tis miles up to London fine town.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Tho else there were smart folks enow:</L>
<L>No wonder, entic'd by such skill;</L>
<L>For they play'd so—I cannot tell how,</L>
<L>But I doat on that Maid i'the Mill.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="172" REF="177"/>
<L>So sweetly she sings, without doubt</L>
<L>I could like, and I'm sure so could you—</L>
<L>Could a body but bring it about;</L>
<L>But, pize on it, the maid's married too.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet, acting apart, there's the scenes,</L>
<L>All fresh as the barley-mow sign;</L>
<L>Shifting backwards and forwards like skreens,</L>
<L>And painted most desperate fine.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then, simple tho I as a sheep,</L>
<L>The man of the shew was so kind,</L>
<L>As to let me just have a bo-peep</L>
<L>At the fine actor-people behind.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>There I thought to have found out a flam;</L>
<L>For of tinsel and stuff I've been told;</L>
<L>But their dresses, ecod, were no sham;</L>
<L>But velvet and silver and gold.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In the green-room, which I took for blue,</L>
<L>Gay ladies I saw richly dress'd;</L>
<L>And some of them handsome ones too;</L>
<L>But their manners were none of the best.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="173" REF="178"/>
<L>For a lass, with one leg in the air,</L>
<L>The other knee-high to be seen,</L>
<L>With her head leaning back on her chair,</L>
<L>Look'd like a carv'd ivory queen.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Her red pouting nib lay so fair</L>
<L>For a kiss, had I fear'd no denial;</L>
<L>But her eyes sparkled, " Do if you date,"</L>
<L>So Ralph was afraid to stand trial.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>On the stage did you see her but dance,</L>
<L>And skip here and there like a vapour,</L>
<L>She'd fling you soon into a trance,</L>
<L>To see what you'd see ev'ry caper.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>For, whisking and frisking about,</L>
<L>As nimble and light as a feather,</L>
<L>Her petticoat makes such a rout,</L>
<L>That one's heart and her heels go together.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>So, Hodge, if so be you're inclin'd,</L>
<L>To the play we will go, lad, together:</L>
<L>Next week, if I hold in the mind,</L>
<L>And God sends the farmers good weather.</L>

<L>ONCE on a time, how long ago</L>

<L>Their island cabbins duly stor'd,</L>

<L>To industry and labour bred,</L>

<L>Sole masters of the wat'ry main,</L>

Condemn'd, tho starving on the shore,</L>
<L>To trespass on the lake no more:</L>
<L>Contented not that nature gave</L>
<L>The spoils and triumphs of the wave;</L>
<L>But, vainly fond to shew their might,</L>
<L>Or turn out champions for the right,</L>
<L>They interfere in all disputes</L>
<L>Between the continental brutes,</L>
<L>And, parties in their feuds to make,</L>
<L>Their island tenements forsake;</L>
<L>Transporting madly brutes and stores,</L>
<L>Blind war to wage on foreign shores,</L>
<L>And save, from otters, bears and cats,</L>

<LG>
<L>Sagacious creatures shall we call</L>

Yet neither, sure, can change the nature,</L>
<L>Of brutal more than human creature!</L>
<L>And yet, as if some revolution</L>
<L>Had happen'd in his constitution,</L>
<L>Thus, oft the beaver leaves his home,</L>
<L>On mountain wilds, for wars, to roam;</L>
<L>Unnatural wars! to him at least,</L>
<L>Amphibious, moisture-loving beast!</L>
<L>In which, a generous jack, with pride,</L>

<L>And hires the poor, at his expence;</L>
<L>To stand up in their own defence;</L>
<L>While ten to one, he trusts the gods,</L>
<L>To him are even trifling odds:</L>
<L>As if, to win, his surest way</L>
<L>Was still to choose the losing play,</L>
<L>Or loggerheads he took delight in,</L>
<L>And fought but for the sake of fighting.</L>

<LG>
<L>Yet beavers are accounted wise,</L>

Now so it happ'd, as poets sing,</L>
<L>A land-rat was the beavers' king:</L>
<L>By all belov'd, without dispute,</L>
<L>A just, humane, and honest brute;</L>
<L>Who, yet, throughout his gracious reign▪</L>
<L>Too highly priz'd his old domain;</L>
<L>Too poor, too weak, without allies</L>
<L>To stand amidst its enemies;</L>
<L>And therefore at their own expence</L>
<L>The beavers purchas'd its defence;</L>
<L>Or when by chance of war 'twas lost</L>

<L>Bribing the tygers, bears and cats,</L>

<L>The tyger bravely bid defiance,</L>

<L>And not an otter dar'd to dive;</L>
<L>Or, daring, reach'd the shore alive.</L>
<L>So powerful were the beavers grown,</L>

<L>Vain conquest! if constrain'd, at last,</L>
<L>To sully all their glory past,</L>

<L>Aloud for their assistance call'd;</L>

<L>And therefore, having got their end,</L>
<L>They need no longer to contend;</L>

<L>THE country was wond'ring for three weeks to∣gether,</L>
<L>Where Sol had retir'd to, and ta'en the fine weather;</L>
<L>Some said (for conjecture runs wild in these cases)</L>
<L>The poles of the world had got out of their places;</L>
<L>While others suppos'd some wet planet had cross'd us,</L>
<L>And some blam'd the Devil and some Dr. Faustus.</L>
<L>But, Saturday darting his beams all around,</L>
<L>The cause of our late want of sunshine I found:</L>
<L>Stepping into the play-house, lo, snug in the box,</L>
<L>Sat Phoebus himself, with his carrotty locks.</L>
<L>Your Godship's obedient, said I, with a sneer;</L>
<L>Who ripens the corn? What the deuce do you here?</L>
<L>"Why, faith, to confess it," his Godship replied,</L>
<L>"I have been on a visit a little aside;</L>
<L>"So well entertain'd I was never before,</L>
<L>"And han't been in heaven for this fortnight and more:</L>
<L>"Such a charmer I've met with, that loth I'm to go,</L>
<L>"And leave her unnotic'd with mortals below."</L>

But tell me what Fair could your heart thus engage—</L>
<L>"Look you there—don't you see her?—She's now on the stage."</L>
<L>I whipt out my glass, the rogue's charmer to see;</L>

<HEAD>THE LOADED ASS; OR PUBLIC CREDIT.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">A POLITICAL FABLE.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>A Mettled ass, in days of yore,</L>
<L>Who burthens basely never bore,</L>
<L>In freedom rang'd the fields around,</L>
<L>And leap'd whatever mares he found;</L>
<L>Where'er he chose in safety fed,</L>
<L>And made what straw he pleas'd, his bed.</L>
<L>But, grown by long indulgence bold,</L>
<L>He scorn'd at length to be controul'd;</L>
<L>And, when his master dar'd to lick him,</L>
<L>Was sure with lifted hoof to kick him.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>At length, howe'er, by chance he fell</L>
<L>To one, who knew the manage well;</L>
<L>And, bent to tame our restive jack,</L>
<L>Resolv'd to let him for a hack.</L>
<L>A neighbouring miller soon he found,</L>
<L>Who corn for all the parish ground,</L>
<L>And, wanting such a beast to bear</L>
<L>The grist committed to his care,</L>
<L><PB N="263" REF="268"/>
To him our sturdy ass was lent</L>
<L>At a large premium per cent.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To market soon the miller goes,</L>
<L>Leading the jack-ass by the nose;</L>
<L>At night returning with a sack,</L>
<L>Laid right across our hero's back;</L>
<L>Who, bending now beneath its weight,</L>
<L>Began to sorrow for his fate,</L>
<L>And, as the miller lagg'd behind,</L>
<L>Unburthen'd thus his troubled mind.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"Alas for what mysterious end</L>
<L>"Must I beneath this burthen bend?</L>
<L>"I, that have liv'd an ass so free</L>
<L>"And bray'd in boundless liberty!</L>
<L>"I, that have long disdain'd the bit!</L>
<L>"Must I, insulted thus, submit</L>
<L>"To bear a cruel weight, alack!</L>
<L>"That needs in time must break my back!"</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then, issuing forth a piteous groan,</L>
<L>His load he gladly would have thrown,</L>
<L>But that the miller fast had tied,</L>
<L>And girt it on the underside:</L>
<L>While having seen his inclination,</L>
<L>He gave him hearty flagellation.</L>
<L><PB N="264" REF="269"/>
With grumbling, and no little scrubbing,</L>
<L>Th' impatient ass put up the drubbing;</L>
<L>But still most grievously complain'd</L>
<L>Of pains he either felt or feign'd.</L>
<L>Again next day to market sent,</L>
<L>with heavy heart and head he went;</L>
<L>But guess with what disdain he burn'd,</L>
<L>When with two sacks he back return'd:</L>
<L>Yet, thus t' augment his toil and trouble,</L>
<L>Each day he found his burthen double;</L>
<L>At the same time (the truth be spoken)</L>
<L>His wind and back remain'd unbroken.</L>
<L>For, tho a life of toil he led,</L>
<L>The more he work'd, the more he fed;</L>
<L>So that, at first, tho lank and weak,</L>
<L>He daily grew mere round and sleek:</L>
<L>While, as they added sack by sack,</L>
<L>More sturdy seem'd his brawny back,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In such good case, 'twas all in vain</L>
<L>He found, to murmur or complain.</L>
<L>Tho constantly, the trough to fill,</L>
<L>More sacks were sent for to the mill.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But no this tonic once set thinking,</L>
<L>He judg'd. at least when fresh with drinking,</L>
<L>That fro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the grievous weights he bore,</L>
<L>He gather'd strength but more and more,</L>
<L><PB N="265" REF="270"/>
And might in time, like Atlas, carry</L>
<L>The world upon his back.—Ay, marry!</L>
<L>'Twere fine if that could come to pass;</L>
<L>But, what so stupid as an ass?</L>
<L>Know, dull machine, and have a care,</L>
<L>There is a weight thou canst not bear:</L>
<L>Much farther should thy masters try</L>
<L>Thy strength, 'twill give their hopes the lye.</L>
<L>Know, even now, thy life's at stake;</L>
<L>A few more sacks thy back will break.</L>
<L>Bethink thee, then, vain brute, in time;</L>
<L>Self-murder is a horrid crime;</L>

<L>Shewn how to write by those who cannot read;</L>

<L>Let me advise thee, tempt thy fate no more,</L>

<HEAD>MARY, THE COOK-MAID'S ADDRESS TO HER FELLOW ARTISTS OF LONDON AND WESTMINSTER.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">AN IMITATION OF SWIFT.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">WRITTEN SOON AFTER HIS MAJESTY'S ACCESSION.</HEAD>
<L>GE'MEN and ladies of the spits, pots, saucepans, and kettles,</L>
<L>And all the other 'tensils made use of in dressing of wittles;</L>
<L>These lines are to let you know, that I wonder what you mean,</L>
<L>That you don't all meet together, dress'd sweet and clean;</L>
<L>And, while you see 'tis the fashion, throughout the nation,</L>
<L>To 'drefs the K—(God bless him) with 'dolence and 'gratulation,</L>
<L>Go, all in a body, and present him your duty on his accession,</L>
<L>As other loyal subjects of like respectable profession.</L>
<L><PB N="284" REF="289"/>
You hear that as how the painters, and gravers that dine at</L>
<L>The foundling hospital, and called themselves artists, design it.</L>
<L>Now, that we are artists as well as they, stands upon record in bookery;</L>
<L>For who of you all hath not read books on the Art of Cookery?</L>
<L>Nay I myself have wrote a volume upon it.— But let that pass;</L>
<L>Tho' it was allowed to be as full of 'rudition as Mrs. Glasse;</L>
<L>And, but that I then liv'd well, and thought begging an impropriety,</L>
<L>I might have had, if I had ask'd, a premium from the what-do-ye-call-it society.</L>
<L>For you are to know that I have not had so low a breeding,</L>
<L>But that, tho' a cook-maid, I am had-up <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Adept.</NOTE> in writing and reading,</L>
<L>And remember that Mr. Pope, when he tells of lord Timon's feats,</L>
<L>Joins together the artists of pictures, musick, meats.</L>
<L>Stand up, therefore, my friends, for the honour of your profession,</L>
<L>And insist upon making a party in the artist's procession.</L>
<L><PB N="285" REF="290"/>
But, if you are prevented by those nigglers of the pencil and chissel,</L>
<L>Make a procession of your own, and let them go whistle;</L>
<L>At the same time give a hint to their cook, who is the son of a sinner,</L>
<L>If, while they are gone to St. James's, he don't take care to spoil their dinner;</L>
<L>Nay, for the slight already put on us, as I hold my pen,</L>
<L>If ev'ry cook was of my mind, they should never have a good dinner again.</L>
<L>They pride themselves mightily on their taste! to be sure!</L>
<L>But, in all matters of taste, a cook must certainly be the greatest coney-sewer <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Connoisseur.</NOTE>.</L>
<L>I like such fellows pretending to have of us no opinion,</L>
<L>When, I'll be hanged, if any of them know the taste of a shalott from an onion.</L>
<L>They are so vain forsooth, of their paultry raree-show of painting.</L>
<L>I am sure, I was starved and squeedged <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Squeezed.</NOTE> there till I was almost fainting.</L>
<L><PB N="286" REF="291"/>
Such sights may serve indeed your skinny, scraggy people of condition;</L>
<L>But, in my mind, a well-roasted sirloin of beef is a much more better exhibition.</L>
<L>Let these upstarts, however, do as they will, I do seriously profess</L>
<L>That, as to going to St. James's, I think you can do no less.</L>
<L>For, if what I have heard be true, our calling is aggriev'd:</L>
<L>And 'tis necessary you should do your best to get it reliev'd:</L>
<L>Being told as how that good-eating is going out of fashion,</L>
<L>Which is, you know, enough to put any cook in the world into a passion.</L>
<L>But what vexes me most, and seems to be a bad presage, is,</L>
<L>That I hear the K—g's, servants are all actually at board-wages:</L>
<L>So that, as his example will likely be followed by the quality,</L>
<L>Good-bye to new French sauces, and old English hospitality.</L>
<L>Nay, John, the butler, tells me (tho' he's a little waggish)</L>
<L>That one of the greatest ladies in the kingdom sups on Scotch kale and haggis.</L>
<L><PB N="287" REF="292"/>
Not but what ladies should eat what they like; but 'tis so comical,</L>
<L>That great folks should be, as our chaplain says, so e-canonical <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Oeconomical.</NOTE>.</L>
<L>I would have you, therefore, go and make an humble representation</L>
<L>Of the evils that threaten the state of cookery in this nation:</L>
<L>And I doubt not, by what I have heard of the K—g's goodness and sagicity <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Sagacity.</NOTE></L>
<L>But that you will meet with proper encouragement from his M-j—y;</L>
<L>Who, the premises considered, will certainly, on mature reflection,</L>
<L>Take every man and woman of us under his protection;</L>
<L>And, if he does not find us work, will have the gracious intentions,</L>
<L>To give us something to play with, by granting us all pensions.</L>

<HEAD>THE BULLFINCH AND SPARROW.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">A FABLE.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">FROM THE FRENCH OF THE KING OF PRUSSIA.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>O greatness, and its pompous train,</L>
<L>What notions false, we entertain!</L>
<L>The glitt'ring dress, the splendid feast,</L>
<L>Those seeking most who know them least;</L>
<L>Our time, anxiety, and cost,</L>

<L>Its joys and griefs to every state</L>
<L>Adapted by the will of fate,</L>
<L>The man we envy, oft as blest,</L>
<L>In secret pines, with care oppress'd!</L>
<L>Of this, though trite, just observation,</L>
<L>My fable is an illustration.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>As, on the rake, one winter's day,</L>
<L>A town-bred sparrow wing'd his way,</L>
<L>Possess'd of each engaging art</L>
<L>To win the feather'd sair one's heart,</L>
<L>To all his rivals still preferr'd,</L>

He lighted near an ancient seat,</L>

<L>Or the right worshipful the mayor,</L>
<L>Whose corporation's all his care.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>There, hopping round from tree to tree</L>
<L>Curious, no doubt, to hear and see,</L>
<L>A bullfinch, from a window nigh,</L>
<L>Attracted the young rover's eye.</L>
<L>Struck with the warbler's gilded cage,</L>
<L>He glow'd with envy, grief, and rage.</L>
<L>"How partial,"he exclaim'd, "is fate!</L>

<L>"To nipping frosts, or melting snows;</L>
<L>"Ills that no pamper'd bullfinch knows!</L>
<L>"He, cherish'd at a sumptuous board,</L>

<L>"Fondled, and by his master fed,</L>
<L>"With sweetest cakes and whitest bread;</L>

"While after me the village runs,</L>

<L>"Why, cruel fate! live I to rue</L>
<L>"I was not hatch'd a bullfinch too!"</L>

<L>The finch, in quite a well-bred way,</L>
<L>Heard what our sparrow had to say,</L>

<L>Without th' interpreter's assistance.</L>
<L>Indeed a bird, not quite a fool,</L>
<L>Brought up in so polite a school,</L>
<L>Could not be thought in want of learning:</L>

<L>"What is there in this fine gilt cage</L>
<L>"So much your fancy should engage?</L>
<L>"These wires my prison bars, where I,</L>

<L>To such a height as ne'er before was known—</L>

<L>By which king Pluto's mirmidons, outwitted,</L>
<L>Certain choice spirits, in theatric shape,</L>
<L>Have suffer'd from Elysium to escape;</L>

<L>Their names—I have 'em down—but, to be brief,</L>

<L>Imprimis, with madeira swell'd, and sack,</L>

But, poets having an exclusive right</L>
<L>To bring their mental progeny to light,</L>
<L>This right's invaded by the party 'peach'd;</L>

<L>Feloniously to set these vagrants free;</L>
<L>With base design t'adopt them for his own,</L>
<L>Tho' Shakespeare's property, and his alone.</L>
<L>Such is the fact.— A critic were an ass,</L>

<L>Great his presumption, to confess the truth:</L>

<L>Lost many an artless smile and dimple sleek,</L>

<L>So great his natural tendency to sinking,</L>

<L>Dramatic sprites (at least they tell me so)</L>
<L>Dwell not with saints above, nor devils below:</L>

But, form'd th' imagination to engage,</L>
<L>During their short-liv'd passage o'er the stage,</L>
<L>As mere ideal characters exist,</L>
<L>And stand as cyphers mark'd on nature's list;</L>
<L>To genius giv'n a delegated power</L>
<L>To form these transient beings of an hour;</L>
<L>Which, from this mimic world whene'er they go,</L>
<L>Are free to range in fancy's pimlico:</L>
<L>A limbo large and broad; which in the schools</L>
<L>Is call'd by some the paradise of fools.</L>
<L>Ferae naturae there, their preservation</L>
<L>Is purchas'd by no game association;</L>
<L>The poaching plagiary alone denied</L>
<L>A privilege, granted to each bard beside;</L>
<L>Who, tho' a cottager, to try his skill,</L>
<L>May shoot, or course, or hunt them down at will;</L>
<L>In his own paddock may the strays receive,</L>
<L>And scorn to ask a lordly owner's leave.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Not but that here, the author of the play,</L>

For know, what private worth soe'er thy boast,</L>
<L>Thy person I address not, but thy post.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Is there a time when statesmen, good or great,</L>
<L>Look down with pity on the toils of state;</L>
<L>Superiour to the boast of boasted things,</L>
<L>The pomp of titles, and the smile of kings;</L>
<L>When, in the private hour of social ease,</L>
<L>Ambition sleeps, and truth itself may please?</L>
<L>At such an hour, when ev'n politeness deigns</L>
<L>To taste the rudeness of familiar strains,</L>
<L>Presuming thou, in honour to the muse,</L>
<L>Indulgent once her labours mayst peruse,</L>
<L>To thee those honest labours she commends;</L>
<L>At court, while honest, doubtless finding friends.</L>
<L>But, through thy levee if forbid to press,</L>
<L>In freedom's plain and anti-courtier's dress,</L>
<L>Light of her rhimes, as of petitions, made,</L>
<L>Should they be lost, forgotten or mislaid,</L>
<L>If not so vain to think thou should'st commend,</L>
<L>In either case permit me to defend.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Too well I know imputed as a crime</L>
<L>The gift of reason to the man of rhime;</L>
<L>To childish Fiction jingling numbers tied,</L>
<L>As bells that dangle by an infant's side;</L>
<L>To useless whims poetic worth confin'd,</L>
<L>To please the sense, but not improve the mind.</L>
<L><PB N="302" REF="307"/>
Should on my daring verse, then, censure fall,</L>
<L>From priest or prelate, waken'd in the stall;</L>
<L>Or should the learned jurors take in hand</L>
<L>To burn the books they may not understand;</L>
<L>Scorn'd the loud torrent of the mob's abuse,</L>
<L>With thee I leave my errour and excuse.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Know then, my patron, once upon a time,</L>
<L>While yet a boy, I caught the itch of rhime:</L>
<L>But, born with hatred to the sing-song train,</L>
<L>Whose numbers charm, like senseless notes, in vain,</L>
<L>While strange to themes t'employ the muse about,</L>
<L>The peccant humour broke but little out;</L>
<L>Till late, in waking dreams that trouble youth,</L>
<L>On one side Prudence urg'd, on t'other Truth:</L>
<L>Prudence, a worldly-minded dame, and sly,</L>
<L>Who fix'd on earth still kept her cautious eye;</L>
<L>While Truth, whose open breast did mine inflame,</L>
<L>Look'd up to heaven; to heaven, from whence she came.</L>
<L>When now my eager heart her power confess'd,</L>
<L>And thus her willing captive she address'd.</L>
<L>"Art thou, my friend, that enterprizing youth</L>
<L>"Who make pretensions to the song of truth;</L>
<L>"By reason taught to leave, in early life,</L>
<L>"The wanton mistress, for the faithful wife?</L>
<L>"Among the sciences thy partner chuse.</L>
<L>"Philosophy's the sister of the muse."</L>
<L><PB N="303" REF="308"/>
Prudence, who heard, made various hems and haws;</L>
<L>And, after due deliberating pause,</L>
<L>Shaking her head, "beware rash youth" she cried,</L>
<L>"Let Prudence here, your early footsteps guide.</L>
<L>"Art thou so ignorant as not to know</L>
<L>"Truth leads us oft to poverty and woe?</L>
<L>"Let me advise—wouldst thou succeed in rhime?</L>
<L>"Mark, at the proper season, well thy time:</L>
<L>"Taking this maxim as a gen'ral rule,</L>
<L>"The knave is honest till he plays the fool:</L>
<L>"For times there are of such malignant face,</L>
<L>"That sharpers only rise to power and place;</L>
<L>"Times when the mere huzza for publick good</L>
<L>"Breaks down all ranks of honour and of blood;</L>
<L>"When sacred characters like bawds are us'd,</L>
<L>"And princes with impunity abus'd;</L>
<L>"The throne of majesty a vulgar thing,</L>
<L>"While George, the cobler, damns great George, the king.</L>
<L>"In times like these, behold on every side</L>
<L>"What pains we take offensive Truth to hide:</L>
<L>"Asham'd to shew her bashful face at court,</L>
<L>"See her simplicity but made its sport;</L>
<L>"Her lovers stigmatiz'd by gen'ral hate,</L>
<L>"As bold disturbers of the church and state.</L>
<L>"Would'st thou to this abandon'd tribe belong?</L>
<L>"What bard e'er heeded yet the truth of song?</L>
<L><PB N="304" REF="309"/>
"Again, 'tis certain there may come a time,</L>
<L>"When Impudence finds no excuse in rhime;</L>
<L>"When even Prudence may herself be just;</L>
<L>"Her int'rest more to keep than break her trust;</L>
<L>"When crowns are honour'd, and, in proper season</L>
<L>"S—, dread patriot, may be hang'd for treason:</L>
<L>"A time, perhaps (years work the strangest things)</L>
<L>"When the brave Scots may love their best of kings;</L>
<L>"When slighted science may approach the throne;</L>
<L>"And Britons make true policy their own.</L>
<L>"What tho their patriot hearts are known to fail,</L>
<L>"When dearth of barley threatens want of ale;</L>
<L>"What tho religion, arm'd by common-sense,</L>
<L>"Breaks but its weapons in its own defence;</L>
<L>"Ev'n yet may piety be kept alive,</L>
<L>"And half-expiring patriotism revive.</L>
<L>"At such a season, should the muse inspire,</L>
<L>"If touch'd with caution, thou mayst strike the lyre,</L>
<L>"Perhaps uncensur'd; but to look for praise!</L>
<L>"Know these, young bard, are no poetic days.</L>
<L>"But should the age, as probably it may,</L>
<L>"Turn its loose politicks another way;</L>
<L>"While, in religious mood, far push'd the schemes</L>
<L>"Of true born Britons, always in extremes,</L>
<L>"The times may yet return when frantic zeal</L>
<L>"Shall give its wooden sword an edge of steel;</L>
<L>"When convocation<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> shall in judgment sit,</L>
<L>"To canvass th' infidelity of wit;</L>
<L><PB N="305" REF="310"/>
"On wicked Knowledge Britain's guilt to lay,</L>
<L>"And drive the destin'd victim far away.</L>
<L>"If thus blind Ignorance should rule, in turn,</L>
<L>"Bards loose their ears, and martyr theists burn;</L>
<L>"Ready reforming constables, at hand,</L>
<L>"Of scientific vice to cleanse the land;</L>
<L>"Have thou with truth nor morals ought to do.</L>
<L>"Things are not always fit that may be true."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Here Prudence ended—her advice was good:</L>
<L>But Truth has charms that cannot be withstood.</L>
<L>Hers then the muse—how far, success will show</L>
<L>In times like ours her song be a-propos.</L>
<L>So much indeed of Prudence did I learn,</L>
<L>My fingers ne'er in politicks to burn.</L>
<L>Silent I sat, amidst the party rout,</L>
<L>When late the ministry turn'd in and out;</L>
<L>When rag'd the furious goose-quills of the times,</L>
<L>To shame their country with their shameless rhimes.</L>
<L>Careless what turtle-eating son of White's</L>
<L>Might set the blunders of the state to rights,</L>
<L>If Pollio, Gallus, Tully, or his grace,</L>
<L>Should all keep out, or who get into place;</L>
<L>I car'd not, I, tho these, or none of these,</L>
<L>The king, the house, or mightier mob might please.</L>
<L>Blam'd I the peer, whom adverse winds had blown</L>
<L>Round the wide world, to prop a monarch's throne;</L>
<L><PB N="306" REF="311"/>
Taught, in the hurricanes of southern seas,</L>
<L>The statesman's wisdom and the courtier's case;</L>
<L>By plunder'd Spaniards, the consummate skill</L>
<L>To steer a kingdom, like a bark, at will?</L>
<L>Tho made too plain the lee-way of the realm,</L>
<L>Did I presume to bid him mind the helm?</L>
<L>Nay, when the guardian genii of the land</L>
<L>To save our desp'rate fortunes took in hand;</L>
<L>I sung them not, tho crown'd, by half the nation,</L>
<L>With civic wreaths, from town and corporation.</L>
<L>I ne'er officious, crack'd my brains t'amend</L>
<L>Errours, the great alone might comprehend;</L>
<L>Plagu'd, with no songs of praise, our lord the king.</L>
<L>Nor gave one faggot to the blaze of Byng;</L>
<L>But, free from panegyrick as abuse,</L>
<L>Put all my little wit to private use.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus far of temp'ral politics I'm clear;</L>
<L>Nor has the spiritual had more to fear.</L>
<L>Since gospel witnesses in form were tried,</L>
<L>Their valid evidence I ne'er denied;</L>
<L>Ne'er intermeddled with the jury's quest,</L>
<L>Nor contradicted Littleton or West.</L>
<L>When church and state learn'd Warburton would join,</L>
<L>Tho sad th' affair, I made it none of mine;</L>
<L>Nor did I e'er, 'gainst Leland's pen, presume</L>
<L>To vindicate Lord Bolingbroke or Hume:</L>
<L><PB N="307" REF="312"/>
Made no pretence to freedom of debate;</L>
<L>Nor risk'd, like harmless Annet, Woolston's fate.</L>
<L>And tho for once, in this, a trick of youth,</L>
<L>Prudential views are sacrific'd to truth;</L>
<L>Could I shake off those vices rhime and sense,</L>
<L>My first might likely prove my last offence;</L>
<L>Or, in thy cause enlisted once my pen,</L>
<L>I never more might trouble Truth again;</L>
<L>But to thy purpose turn my ready hand,</L>
<L>True to the law and gospel of the land.</L>
