<HEAD>TO THE EARL OF HARCOURT.</HEAD>
<P>As I have attempted to write a Comedy at the flattering instigation of your Lordship, the following scenes have a natural claim to your protection. If, when you prompted and encouraged me to court the Comic Muse, you had imparted to me at the same time some share of your instinctive penetration into character— of your elegant, but impres∣sive ridicule of fashionable levities—had you consigned to my hand the clue that guides you in the chace and detection of folly through the intricate windings of her labyrinth, I should have presented to you a Comedy more worthy of your attention. Such as it is, it offers me an opportunity of publickly ac∣knowledging the high value I set upon a friendship, which I have had the happiness of enjoying so many years.</P>

<BYLINE>WRITTEN BY JOHN TAYLOR, ESQ.</BYLINE>
<SP>
<STAGE>Spoken by Mr. Barrymore.</STAGE>
<LG>
<L>"SHOOT Folly as it flies." Such is the game,</L>
<L>At which, 'tis said, the Comic Muse should aim;</L>
<L>The darker passions that the heart deform,</L>
<L>And spread o'er groaning states the moral storm,</L>
<L>Are pompous themes the sportive Maid resigns,</L>
<L>To swell her solemn Sister's lofty lines.</L>
<L>Yet when she fain would strike such tow'ring prey,</L>
<L>The serious Damsel takes the safest way;</L>
<L>Tho' proud yet prudent—wounding guilt too high,</L>
<L>To wake in you the self-reproaching sigh;</L>
<L>In sluggish apathy you careless sit,</L>
<L>Nor smart for crimes that you could ne'er commit:</L>
<L>But, in the comic province, who shall dare</L>
<L>To touch the faults that you may haply share?</L>
<L>For conscience then may strengthen the appeal,</L>
<L>And bid you crush what forces her to feel.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>For Virtue, zealous and disdaining awe,</L>
<L>E'en fear'd by those too mighty for the law,</L>
<L>The Stage, through ev'ry station, Vice has try'd,</L>
<L>And honest Satire has her lash applied.</L>
<L><PB REF="5"/>Hence, while the Comic Muse must fear to wound,</L>
<L>She still is doom'd to course o'er beaten ground;</L>
<L>Again bring forward what too well you know,</L>
<L>Or, if a novelty, some monster shew.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To-night our Bard, who long has struck the lyre,</L>
<L>A modest minstrel of the plaintive choir,</L>
<L>Attempts for once a harmless laugh to raise,</L>
<L>More dreading censure than presuming praise.</L>
<L>One point we fairly in his cause may plead—</L>
<L>For know, he dares to touch the scribbling breed;</L>
<L>Dares strip from dull conceit its bold pretence,</L>
<L>And prove an Author may be void of sense.</L>
<L>Then let your candour countenance the grace</L>
<L>That freely owns the follies of his race;</L>
<L>And sure our Bard e'en Malice need not fear,</L>
<L>(Could Malice lurk in specious ambush <HI>here</HI>)</L>
<L>E'en she may yield her pittance of applause</L>
<L>To him whose vent'rous pen a brother draws;</L>
<L>For while thus sportive on a scribbling elf,</L>
<L>Our simple Poet may deride himself.</L>

<HEAD>The following Lines, written by the Rev. Mr. PRITCHARD, Jun. before he knew the Author was in possession of another Pro∣logue, contain too much Merit to be sup∣pressed.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>THERE liv'd at Argos once a youth of fame,</L>
<L>(So Horace tells) and Lycas was his name,</L>
<L>Who, (if there is a joy which mad men know,</L>
<L>And such as madness only can bestow)</L>
<L>By the strong force of its prevailing pow'r,</L>
<L>Wak'd to fresh transport ev'ry new-born hour.</L>
<L>Each visionary scene that fancy drew,</L>
<L>His mind embodied, and confirm'd it true.</L>
<L>Oft, in the height of his distemper's rage,</L>
<L>He saw, or fancy'd that he saw, a stage;</L>
<L>Where as he heard the self-imagin'd sound,</L>
<L>And trod, or thought he trod, dramatic ground;</L>
<L>Where, with nice skill in imitative art,</L>
<L>Each son of Thespis seem'd to play his part,</L>
<L>The fond conceit drew down his loud applause,</L>
<L>As tho' reality had been the cause,</L>
<L>And ev'ry member, head, hands, lips, and eyes,</L>
<L>Profess'd their praise, and testified surprize.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>If such the charm where fancy gave delight,</L>
<L>Let truth, not fiction, plead our cause to-night;</L>
<L><PB REF="7"/>And, as I come to take a nearer view,</L>
<L>Pleading for him who strives to pleasure you,</L>
<L>Oh! may propitious Beauty<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">To the Boxes.</NOTE> smile reward!</L>
<L>May Science<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">To the Pit.</NOTE> favour, and the Gods<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">To the Galleries.</NOTE> regard!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Sons of renown, the bards of ancient days,</L>
<L>Wore on their heads a circling crown of bays,</L>
<L>These bloom eternal, for to them belong</L>
<L>The grace, the pride, the energies of song;</L>
<L>The tale well-told, the animated line,</L>
<L>The glow of sentiment, and thought divine;</L>
<L>Yet still there blossoms many a virgin flow'r,</L>
<L>On the fair spot where Genius rears her bow'r;</L>
<L>Of these our bard presents before your view,</L>
<L>One of a simple, but unsully'd hue;</L>
<L>Should the mild off'ring kind acceptance share,</L>
<L>Tis your's to weave the crown, and his to wear.</L>

<HEAD>ACT I.</HEAD>
<STAGE><HI>Enter Lady</HI> BELLAIR—<HI>Mr.</HI> FASHION.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mr.</HI> FASHION.</SPEAKER>
<P>I AM happy at your Ladyship's arrival. We ex∣pected you last night.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Bellair.</SPEAKER>
<P>I purposely avoided coming last night, that I might not be complicated in the em∣barrassment of the Welch family's arrival, whom I understand came yesterday. What sort of crea∣tures are they? How many did the caravan consist of? I expect to see the whole race of Shenkin.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Fash.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do not be alarmed as to their num∣ber; I will give your Ladyship a list of the <HI>dra∣matis personae,</HI> and a faint sketch of their characters.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray do! for I have seen nobody, not even my brother, the <HI>padrone della casa.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Fash.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lord Melcourt, I know, is walked out; I was just enquiring after him. But to return to the subject;—Yesterday evening, the family coach, covered with dust, and much damaged by the toil and length of the journey, waddled up to
<PB N="6" REF="10"/>the hall-door in great labour, and was happily de∣livered of Sir Pepper Plinlimmon, Lady Plinlim∣mon, Miss Plinlimmon, and a <HI>femme de chambre;</HI> two servants attended on Welch ponies. The coach, I must inform you, contained originally five persons, but it miscarried on the road of Mr. Taffey, their chaplain, who could not bear the in∣side of a carriage. He is, however, expected to∣morrow, in the basket of some stage-coach.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady B.</SPEAKER>
<P>I fancy we shall be able to do without Mr. Taffey.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Fash.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed you are mistaken. He is one of the essential personages in our drama, for he is to join the hands of Lord Melcourt and Miss Plinlimmon.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady B.</SPEAKER>
<P>What sort of a thing is the girl?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Fash.</SPEAKER>
<P>She is very well as to beauty; her shape elegantly and harmoniously formed, but when in motion, ungraceful. Her mind is a com∣pound of ignorance and information, like the waving branches that give a checquered kind of light. She made us laugh last night at supper with the childish simplicity of her questions, and sometimes she excited our admiration at the quickness of her repartee, and the solidity of her judgment; in a word, she appears to be an inspired ideot.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now let me have the portrait of Sir Pepper.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Fash.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir Pepper is a plain, unassuming man, subject at times to a warmth of temper, and whose local train of impoverished ideas are quite unsuitable to the scene he is now entering upon, and to the company with which he is now to asso∣sociate. His mind has received a peculiar biass respecting the prophecies that have been floating of late, and he is almost convinced the world will be at an end before his daughter has brought Lord Melcourt a son and heir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="7" REF="11"/>
<SPEAKER>Lady B.</SPEAKER>
<P>I confess, I like the whimsicallity of that notion; it will serve to amuse us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Fash.</SPEAKER>
<P>As for Lady Plinlimmon, she has a considerable share of vanity; half of which she spends in admiration of her daughter-in-law, the other she consumes upon herself. She imagines she has a refined taste for literature, that she is a supreme judge of painting, and—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! then she is intolerable.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Fash.</SPEAKER>
<P>By no means. There is a broad good-humour about her which makes her inoffensive. She looks with impatience for the honour of ce∣menting an acquaintance with your Ladyship.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady B.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think, from your description, it will not be unentertaining to pass a day or two with these Welch Emigrants. But does my brother seem happy at his approaching nuptials?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Fash.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yesterday he seemed at first over∣come by the invasion of these Vandals; but his native mirth rallied, and at the close of the evening he was himself again. But here he comes.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Enter Lord</HI> MELCOURT.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Mel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sister, you are welcome! You look in high beauty. The elegant circles in town will be eclipsed without you. Have you seen our new kindred?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not yet. Mr. Fashion has been giv∣ing me a slight sketch of them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Mel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, I am ready to consign Sir Pepper, and Lady Plinlimmon to the full dis∣charge of your raillery; but spare, I intreat you, my shepherdess of the Alps.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Never fear; never fear.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Mel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lady Plinlimmon looks for your arrival with all the flutter of anxious expectation. Your fame, like an artful prologue, has smoothed
<PB N="8" REF="12"/>the way to a kind reception: she talks of you as the paragon of excellence; she will study your whole person; observe every motion, attitude, and every article of your dress.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Fash.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lady Bellair may be said to be a capital picture from the gallery of fashion, for Lady Plinlimmon to copy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady B.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will venture to say, without the im∣peachment of vanity, that the copy will not come up to the merit of the original.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Fash.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your Ladyship is perfectly right.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady B.</SPEAKER>
<P>But tell me, brother, don't you feel, independent of the charms of your young bride, an uncommon elasticity of mind in the removal of the incumbrances which this marriage will effect?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Mel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes. Upon that ground I plant the standard of my gaudiest streamer. I have had a private conference with Sir Pepper, and his im∣mediate relinquishing of his Brecknockshire estate will enable me to part with my Irish acres, and satisfy all my noisy claimants; who, like a vora∣cious pack of hounds, have chaced me from hill to dale, and notwithstanding the windings of excuses, and the intricate mazes of delay, would have soon overtaken me, had not this golden shower from the Welch mountains put an end to the chace.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Bravo! Are we to expect any more company?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Mel.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have invited my friend Fancy, the miniature-painter. I expect also Phrensy, the poet, whom you have often heard me talk of; he will suit Lady Plinlimmon, and their mutual ec∣centricities will divert us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Fash.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am glad that oddity will be added to the group; you have frequently amused me with anecdotes concerning him. When will he be here?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Mel.</SPEAKER>
<P>I expect him every minute. He writes word he will be here to-day, but begs his
<PB N="9" REF="13"/>coming may be a secret; and, as he is not person∣nally known to any body but myself, he desires to assume the name of Tombstone.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Fash.</SPEAKER>
<P>What a whim! What can he mean?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Most likely he is afraid of his cre∣ditors—however, do not betray him to the rest of our society. But here come our Welch relatives, <STAGE>(<HI>Enter Sir</HI> PEPPER PLINLIMMON, <HI>Lady</HI> PLIN∣LIMMON, <HI>and Miss</HI> PLINLIMMON.)</STAGE> Give me leave to present Lady Bellair, to your Ladyship.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Plin.</SPEAKER>
<P>Independent of the connection that is taking place between our families, I rejoice at the opportunity that now offers of commencing an acquaintance with Lady Bellair.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your Ladyship does me a great deal of honour. I hope Sir Pepper, you will like this part of the world sufficiently to engage you to stay among us some time.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Plin.</SPEAKER>
<P>What ease! What elegance!</P>
<STAGE>Aside.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir P. Plin.</SPEAKER>
<P>I should wish to enjoy your Lady∣ship's society, but I am rather disposed to return as soon as I can; for if, as Nostradamus says, we are in the fifth act I should like to be at home when the curtain drops.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Plin.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear Sir Pepper, do not cloud the splendour of Lady Bellair's mind, with the dark mists of your odious prophecies.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady B.</SPEAKER>
<P>I beg your Ladyship will let Sir Pepper say what he chooses, I am not easily alarm∣ed: credulity is not my foible. But this is a con∣versation of too severe a cast for our young bride: you, my dear, may send your expecting eye through a long and gay perspective.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss P.</SPEAKER>
<P>So I do! I expect to have fine cloaths, to go to a great many balls, and I expect to be married!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir P. Plin.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your Ladyship will exuse the wild simplicity of my daughter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="10" REF="14"/>
<SPEAKER>Lady B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! I am a great admirer of artless simplicity; it is as rare to be met with as sincerity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Plin.</SPEAKER>
<P>When she has exchanged the rude breezes of the mountain where she was bred, for the gentler gales of polished society, she will assimi∣late with the soft elegance of her new situation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Fash.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lady Bellair herself could not have invented a metaphor more happily allusive.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir P. Plin.</SPEAKER>
<P>My wife is very metaphoricall.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Plin.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes! we all have our different <HI>calls;</HI> mamma is metaphoricall—papa is propheticall— I am comicall—the old curate, near Plinlimmon Castle, is classicall, and his wife is dropsicall!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Plin.</SPEAKER>
<P>You must check this careless volu∣bility.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Mel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Suppose, gentlemen, we leave the ladies to confer by themselves. Will you allow me, Sir Pepper, to shew you the Vandyke I men∣tioned last night?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Plin.</SPEAKER>
<P>I should wish your Ladyship not to be impressed with an idea that my daughter-in-law is deficient in the great outline of education, though she has not yet received the last touchings of embellishment. I myself have been her tuto∣ress, and have read to her several of the best En∣glish authors.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Plin.</SPEAKER>
<P>And all the Welch poets.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Plin.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your Ladyship's society will supply. I consign this young Alpine plant to your care: 'tis yours to give the pliant branches their proper direction, and to breathe on them a playful air of easy negligence. With your permission, I will now
<PB N="11" REF="15"/>withdraw for the purpose of my girls imbibing from your Ladyship those nameless graces you only can bestow.</P>

<P>What are those things mamma says you are to bestow upon me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady B.</SPEAKER>
<P>My friendship! And you in return must have some friendship for me, and speak to me with confidence upon every point that relates to your marriage with my brother. By what he has said to me, I find he is extremely attached to you: I hope his attachment will meet with an equal return on your part.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Plin.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is as it may be.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady B.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am sure Lord Melcourt is reckoned by all the ladies very handsome, amiable, enter∣taining, and —</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Plin.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know all that, and I should be very partial to him, if —</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady B.</SPEAKER>
<P>If what, my dear?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Plin.</SPEAKER>
<P>If—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Has he done any thing to offend you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Plin.</SPEAKER>
<P>No! but he has done nothing to please me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Does he appear to neglect you? I re∣collect he was uncommonly assiduous in writing to you last winter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Plin.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh yes! he frequently wrote to me, and he used to say in his letters, that when I should come to Melcourt Hall, we should wander through the groves together, and he would say such tender things to me by the river-side. Now we were by the river-side yesterday evening, and scarce one word did he say to me, but conversed with my papa about the winding of his river; egad! I wish it was wound round his neck.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Fie, child! You must not imagine that Lord Melcourt's attention is to be totally devoted to you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="12" REF="16"/>
<SPEAKER>Miss Plin.</SPEAKER>
<P>Am I then not to expect any share of his conversation? Is there to be no time for wooing? no flirtation? no whispering? no toying? no innocent anticipation?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Miss Plinlimmon, the manufacturing of love in Wales may perhaps be as coarse as a sackcloth, but in this part of the world, the cupids of fashion weave the fine texture with a light and invisible hand.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Plin.</SPEAKER>
<P>Invisible indeed! But if I am never to partake of his company, what am I come here for? what shall I be the better for being married to him? where is the advantage?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady B.</SPEAKER>
<P>You will obtain the advantage of his name and title; you will move in a higher sphere.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Plin.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I always understood, that wed∣lock was a kind of travelling through life toge∣ther?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady B.</SPEAKER>
<P>So it is, but then it is like travelling in the double stage-coach; you go the same jour∣ney together, without seeing or incommoding one another.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Plin.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hate the double stage-coach; I like a vis-a-vis much better. However, if Lord Mel∣court does not become more assiduous, he may be supplanted—Fashion is much more attentive.</P>

<P>Was it the fear of your creditors?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Phrensy.</SPEAKER>
<P>No such terrestrial motive urged me to assume another name: this liberty I have taken with myself flows from a more sublime cause, than the apprehension of bailiffs! I will now disclose the mystery—unless you choose to hear the epithalamium first—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Mel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do not trifle any longer, but let me know the purport of this mysterious conduct.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Phrensy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Envy, which attends living au∣thors, has pursued me with great implacability.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="14" REF="18"/>
<SPEAKER>Lord Mel.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not recollect that I ever heard your works censured.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Phrensy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Likely enough—censure would have excited notice—notice would have led to observation—observation to justice—justice to admiration—no no! Envy, my Lord took another method with me, she some how or other, contriv∣ed to breathe over me and my works a dread repose. The warehouse where my productions are deposited, resembles a family vault where all my numerous progeny are at rest! And are only distinguished from one another by labels—such as Phrensy's comedies—Phrensy's tragedies—Phren∣sy's satires—Phrensy's —</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Mel.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what has all this to do with the changing of your name?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Phrensy.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am now coming to the mark: my friends have soothed me with the idea, that posterity will do me justice—that posterity will say to these sleepers, arise! Then will my comedies, my tragedies, my odes, shake off their dust and dazzle the admiring world.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Mel.</SPEAKER>
<P>What is all this to the purpose?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Phrensy.</SPEAKER>
<P>You shall hear—instead of pati∣ently waiting the natural process of time, I con∣ceived a stratagem of anticipating my triumphs, and of taking a short cut to posterity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Mel.</SPEAKER>
<P>How do you mean—by cutting your throat?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>What's done?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Phrensy.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have killed myself; that is to say I have given out that I am dead. This is the reason for changing my name—envy was never played such a trick before—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Mel.</SPEAKER>
<P>But why take the melancholy name of Tombstone?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Phrensy.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is to keep me in recollec∣tion that I am dead.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="15" REF="19"/>
<SPEAKER>Lord Mel.</SPEAKER>
<P>There is sense in that.</P>
</SP>

<P>But this stratagem, my Lord, has not yet answered my sanguine expectation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Mel.</SPEAKER>
<P>How so?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Phrensy.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have been three weeks dead, and would you believe that there has not been in any of the papers, an elegy, a posthumous puff, or a line in my commendation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Mel.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is very strange.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Phrensy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Egad! A tallow-chandler might have slipt out of the world, as easily as I have done.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Mel.</SPEAKER>
<P>How did you insert your death in the papers, for it escaped my notice.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Phrensy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Simply thus—yesterday died, universally lamented, the eminent poet, Classical Phrensy, Esq.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Mel.</SPEAKER>
<P>To be sure, nothing could be more simple and modest—but I have an idea, that I think will serve your scheme better—I will have it inserted in the papers, and you shall draw up the paragraph, to this purpose—yesterday the emi∣nent poet, Classical Phrensy, Esq. died suddenly, at Melcourt-Hall, where he was upon a visit to his friend, Lord Melcourt.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Phrensy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very good—excellent concep∣tion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Mel.</SPEAKER>
<P>The circumstance of making your exit at my country-house, during the interesting moment of my nuptials, will give your death an eclat.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Phrensy.</SPEAKER>
<P>This second edition of my death, with additions, will do admirably faith, but what will your company say, when they shall read the paragraph?</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Lord Mel.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall take particular care, that none of them shall see it.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mr. Phrensy.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what does your Lordship smile at?</P>
</SP>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Phrensy.</SPEAKER>
<P>As how?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Mel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Fancy, the miniature-painter, will be here to day—I shall tell him as a profound secret that you lie dead in the house, and that it is unknown to the company—and I will beg of him, as you are my friend, to take a faint sketch of you—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Phrensy.</SPEAKER>
<P>This will, as your Lordship says, enrich the paragraph, which may run thus—Mr. Phrensy being the intimate friend of Lord Mel∣court, an eminent painter from town was sent for, to take a likeness of the great poet.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Mel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Admirable! You have only to whiten your face, and make yourself like a ghost in an opera, the painter shall only peep at you, and then finish the sketch from memory—trust to my contri∣vance, you shall not be detected.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Mr. Fancy.</SPEAKER>
<P>I never heard of his name.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Mel.</SPEAKER>
<P>He has lived a great deal abroad, he is lately returned from Africa; I had another ingenious man here, and he was my particular friend, but a sudden death has deprived me of that invaluable person: what I am going to relate, is a secret, nobody is acquainted with the terrible accident, except a confidential servant. Poor Phrensy, the poet, died suddenly last night; he is now in the house, and is to be removed this even∣ing: I should be happy to have a resemblance of my old friend, and if you would have the good∣ness to take a hasty sketch of him, you would in∣finitely oblige me.</P>

<P>You shall, Mr. Fancy. I suppose the bride is to be embellished by your pencil?</P>

<P>Of course. But Lord Melcourt did not send for me merely to paint the young lady.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mr. Phrensy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your pencil will undoubtedly run through the whole family.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Likely enough. But I have another meaning. I am sent for—I am sure Mr. Tomb∣stone may be trusted; and as the first fruits of my friendship for you, I will deposit in your breast a profound secret.</P>

<P>I will in return communicate to you, the first secret that is whispered in my ear.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Fancy.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have, then, to inform you, that there is a person lies dead in the house, and Lord Melcourt has begged I would just catch a resem∣blance of his departed friend.</P>
</SP>

<P>Who is it?</P>

<P>By no means! Reflect what an awful task is now imposed upon you! Methinks I

</SP>

<P>But whence this enthusiasm? After all it must be confessed, that the friendship of Lord Melcourt was the highest feather in his cap.</P>

<P>Talk not to me of feather, or of cap! His head was encircled with laurel, wove by the public hand! For shame Mr. Fancy, is it thus you revere the illustrious dead?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Fancy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don't be so warm, Mr. Tomb∣stone, I am perhaps a little ungenerous in speak∣ing against the dead who cannot defend them∣selves: but tell me dispassionately, do you admire poor Phrensy's writings?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Phrensy.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do! I know them by heart, have you a mind to hear the sixteenth scene of his tragi-comedy, in six acts, where the princess catches her.—</P>

<P>No, no! I will not give you the trouble of repeating your friend's verses.</P>

<P>But if he was so dear a friend, how comes it you are not more affected by his death?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Phrensy.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am astonished, stunned, bewil∣dered at the dreadful secret you disclosed! When the first impression is subsided, grief will succeed: Lord Melcourt out of affection for me secreted the melancholy event, but I begin to feel myself overpowered.</P>

<P>I am afraid the task I have imposed upon you, is unpleasant: you feel, I make no doubt, very disagreeable sensations upon this occa∣sion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Fancy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not in the least, a lifeless frame does not impress me with any disturbance; I drew Lady Fidget's dead monkey the other day without any kind of perturbation.</P>

<SPEAKER>Lord Mel.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, Mr. Fancy, do you make no dis∣tinction between Lady Fidget's dead monkey, and the remains of my friend?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Fancy.</SPEAKER>
<P>As he was your friend, I respect him, but does your Lordship really think he is worthy of those encomiums, that you and Mr. Tombstone, so profusely bestowed upon him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Mel.</SPEAKER>
<P>My partiality may perhaps cast a little suffusion over my judgment. But tell me, do

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Fancy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perhaps as much as your Lordship, 'tis impossible with so refined an understanding as yours to receive any entertainment from his writ∣ings; the characters in his plays, for example, may be compared to the incongruities that we meet with on sign-posts: things that never existed in nature, such as blue boars, black swans, dragons, and mermaids—I never felt a more pleasing invi∣tation to a slumber, than I did at his last comedy, which unfortunately I did not enjoy long, for I was roused by a thousand cat-calls.</P>

<P>I beg I may be the negociator of peace between the living and the dead; in the first place I can assure Mr. Fancy no indignity was meant to him—Mr. Phrensy, for particular rea∣sons, having given out that he was dead, I thought a portrait of the author, by a celebrated painter, would add lustre to the posthumous edition of his works.</P>

<P>I should like to be drawn reading, for I know I have a pretty down-cast look</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Plin.</SPEAKER>
<P>I must not forget to inform you that all the females of the Plinlimmon's have had a fa∣mily mole, a little above the left eye, for these two centuries: Now Isabella's is too complicated with the eye-brow; perchance you can make some slight alteration.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr Fancy.</SPEAKER>
<P>By the omnipotence of the pen∣cil we can raise the beauty spot, and place it in view.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Mel.</SPEAKER>
<P>But is not that departing from rea∣lity? is it not a deceit? a kind of pencil lie?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Fancy.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is only changing the local resem∣blance, it is at the worst a skilful and elegant inac∣curacy; the beauty-spot is there, I make no ad∣dition to what nature has already done, I only bring to the eye of admiration, what her Lady∣ship informs me nature has rather removed from the sight.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Plin.</SPEAKER>
<P>I declare Mr. Fancy, you defend yourself most ingeniously, does he not my Lord?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Mel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Most skilfully indeed!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Fancy.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have taken a much greater licence than this, without feeling any reproach of consci∣ence; for example, when I had the honor of draw∣ing Lady Frizlerump, I broke the immeasurable length of her bald buff forehead, by introducing two moles and a patch, the patch you know is a thing ad libitum, and as I knew Lady Frizlerump had a mole on each shoulder, I removed them from their native spot, (they were well worth the carriage) and I placed them in a more conspicuous situation; there is no great deceit in this, it is only
<PB N="28" REF="32"/>a kind of transplanting, which ought to be as al∣lowable in painting as in gardening.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Mel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well ladies, you perceive how sport-fully Mr. Fancy discourses, he has a mind to give you a specimen of his manner of entertaining his company, when they are sitting to him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Plin.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I think, before we come to any determination about the dress, it would be proper to consult the attic taste of Lady Bellair.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Fancy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Most assuredly, you may shew her these miniatures which I have lately finished. This is the portrait of Miss Harelip, <STAGE>(gives the miniatures)</STAGE> which attracted the public eye the last exhibition. This is only a profile of Miss Woolsack, the Judge's daughter.</P>

<P>The mutual exchange of pic∣tures, is one of the etiquettes of modern marriages.</P>

<P>In this mutual exchange, pray my Lord, inform me which of us two will be the gainer?</P>

<STAGE>(Taking the miniature.)</STAGE>
<P>'Tis beau∣tiful, nor could it be otherwise, while it presumed to have any resemblance of your Ladyship—but you just now mentioned your marriage, I know that you and Lord Bellair were separated not long after; interested as I am in whatever re∣lates to your Ladyship, do not imagine it is mere curiosity that solicits some illustration upon that point.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Bell.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am ready to give you every infor∣mation, and the more so, as ill-nature, that mono∣tonous and dull commentator, may have construed our separation in her invariable manner.</P>

<P>Lord Bellair, somewhat advanced in years, palled, and satiated with the pleasures of the town, began to medicate a retreat; but before he retired into the country, from which he was never
<PB N="30" REF="34"/>to return, he ranged through all the gay scenes of public resort, to find a youthful associate, to accompany him in his retirement.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Plin.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your mysterious history begins to unfold itself; the beauteous flower that flourished in the bright sunshine of admiration, grew pale and cheerless when it was transplanted to the soli∣tary gloom of the country.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady B.</SPEAKER>
<P>I must confess your Ladyship's ex∣temporary apologue comprises my little story, and makes my continuation unnecessary.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Plin.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not at all—I beg you will continue your interesting narrative.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lord Bellair, amidst the innumerable beauties, that at once attracted and bewildered his choice, threw at length his selecting glance upon me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Plin.</SPEAKER>
<P>His choice did honor to his taste.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady B.</SPEAKER>
<P>It did not however contribute to his happiness—the single voice of my reluctance was lost in the chorus of approbation that resounded from all my relations and friends—I then sum∣moned all the fortitude I was capable of, and took a courageous leave of the town—adieu, I cried, to the flattery of men—to the pleasing envy of the women—adieu to balls—adieu to the delight of charioteering in a phaeton through St. James's Street every morning—adieu to the easy instruc∣tions of the town, to the contemplation of man∣ners in caracature-shops, to the reading of Shakespear upon canvass, and to the study of the English history upon walls—the fatal hour arrived— the carriage was at the door—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Plin.</SPEAKER>
<P>You really excite my compassion! What ensued when you reached the ancient fa∣mily seat?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Say rather the family vault!—I wrapt myself up in my resignation, as in a winding sheet, and thought to have buried myself in a husband—
<PB N="31" REF="35"/>the fates decreed otherwise: I broke forth from the ponderous marble, beneath which I was quiet∣ly inurned, and am come again to reside among the living.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Plin.</SPEAKER>
<P>The world is a considerable gainer be enjoying you once more. Fortunate was the storm that blew such a flower upon the lap of so∣ciety. But whence arose that storm? Did it arise from Lord Bellair's ill-temper? however, I am not curious; indeed I can partly guess: the soli∣tude of the country, faintly checquered by the vi∣sits of the apothecary, and the vicar's wife; his Lordship's fulsome fondness—his odious approaches—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady B.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dear Lady Plinlimmon, you are going on so rapidly! It is of no use to reckon the slight imperceptible threads of discontent, which grew at length into a cable. Behold me restored to independence, sufficiently affluent, and almost as happy as a widow.</P>
</SP>

<P>May nothing interrupt the happiness you possess, and which you deserve! Before I had the honour of your acquaintance, I heard your merits highly extolled.</P>

<P>Yes! I recollect those old tapestry figures. But you must not imagine there was any intimacy between us! I endured them at my toilet. They may be reckoned, if you please, among my morning friends, but you may be sure I never ac∣knowledged the creatures in an evening.</P>
</SP>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Phrensy.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am calm again: but you will ex∣cuse a little warmth in favour of a person who is as dear to me as myself. We were inseparable; we never differed upon the smallest point; if one spoke, the other listened; if one slept, the other nodded.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Plin.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! such a friendship is seldom to be found. I can assure you, sir, the warmth that

<P>Nothing so proper. Give me leave to cite a couplet, composed by my lamented friend, applicable to this subject. It is a happy couplet; he sent it to Lady Nightshade, who is well versed in the loves of the plants; it runs thus:

<P>To undeceive me? What can you mean, Mr. Tombstone?</P>

<P>Be so good as to inform me, who fancied these decorations? Are they indebted to the hand of any foreign artist?</P>

<P>There is no occasion to apply to foreign auxiliaries, for the purposes of elegant art—the native growth of our soil, amply supplies the demands of taste in every department.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir P. Plin.</SPEAKER>
<P>This relievo, is happily executed! come here, Isabella, you understand mythology. Here is hymen, attended by a group of cupids? Do you conceive the allegoric meaning of the artist?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Plin.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perfectly! Here is Hymen, with a torch in his hand, that is, I suppose to light the bride and bridegroom home. And the dear little cupids I suppose, foretell the children.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir P. Plin.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ridiculous! You pervert every thing by your distorted applications! But explain the remainder—you see night personated follow∣ing Hymen, she throws o'er her frame a mantle studded with stars, and among the stars, appears a crescent—</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<SPEAKER>Miss Plin.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is your turn now, you shall explain this—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Fash.</SPEAKER>
<P>Upon my word, I think this a most excellent allegory, and illustrates well the short triumph of matrimony—the chain of roses is easily broken, and the roses soon fade.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Mel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Fashion speaks the language of an inveterate batchelor, yet every thing in nature condemns his sarcasm: the birds, that make this grove re-echo with their harmony, what are all their songs, but so many hymns in honor of the married state.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Fash.</SPEAKER>
<P>I ask your pardon, Lord Melcourt. The economy of your grove, will not assist your argument, in defence of Hymen, for every fea∣thered couple who were so happy the last spring are now divorced, and all the harmony and love, which now reign in your woods is the result of separation and of new engagements.</P>

SCENE—<HI>Book-Room.</HI></STAGE>
<STAGE><HI>Lady</HI> PLINLIMMON <HI>and Mr.</HI> PHRENSY, <HI>at a table covered with plants and flowers.</HI></STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Plin.</SPEAKER>
<P>What a wonderful system have you brought me acquainted with? I never could have conceived there were such astonishing things in nature, as male and female flowers—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Phrensy.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have most assuredly, let your Ladyship a little into Flora's secrets.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Plin.</SPEAKER>
<P>Male and female flowers! I am pe∣trified! But tell me, learned professor, when the flowers are at a distance from one another, how they communicate their mutual passion?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Phrensy.</SPEAKER>
<P>There nature interposes her happiest stratagem! She calls her western gales, her amo∣rous zephyrs, and they on heir fragrant wings convey the lovers to each other.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Plin.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now, Sir, as you have led me, as it were, behind the curtain into Flora's green-room, I confess, I am not much edified at the morals of the plants? Indeed the flowers appear to be an abandoned profligate race—here is a honey suckle, which you say contains five males, and only one female—this modest snow-drop, you tell me, has six husbands—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Phrensy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, nature has been rather partial to your sex in her economy of plants.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Plin.</SPEAKER>
<P>Poor things! What a pity it is they are not endowed with sensibility!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Phrensy.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have observed, since the ladies of fashion have applied to the study of botany, they are not only ambitious of rivaling the flowers in beauty, but they have also endeavoured in some degree to rival them in their other prerogatives.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Plin.</SPEAKER>
<P>Take care, Mr. Phrensy; you are
<PB N="43" REF="47"/>growing censorious. <STAGE>(<HI>Enter Sir</HI> PEPPER PLIN∣LIMMON.)</STAGE> You cannot imagine, Sir Pepper, how delighted I am with the beautiful and sublime science of botany!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir P. Plin.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Plin.</SPEAKER>
<P>This learned gentleman has raised, as it were, the veil of nature, and has revealed to me some of her secrets; and I must own, secrets that excite my astonishment. According to the illus∣trations of this learned professor, the chalice of every flower is a kind of a house of bad fame.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir P. Plin. </SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(ironically)</STAGE>
<P>Then a lady of your unspotted virtue ought to shrink, as the sensitive-plant, from a study that presents to you nothing but scenes of immorality.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Plin.</SPEAKER>
<P>There can be no harm in gratifying a literary curiosity. But I assure you, Sir Pepper, I shall be apt to think it is not extremely decent to wear a nosegay!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir P. Plin.</SPEAKER>
<P>If you would read the delightful poem of the Loves of the Plants, you need not give this gentleman any further trouble. At pre∣sent I must take the liberty of desiring him to leave us alone, as I have something to communicate to you in private.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Phrensy.</SPEAKER>
<P>I obey your commands. In our next lecture we will expatiate on the dews that re∣fresh the flowers at night.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Exit Mr.</HI> PHRENSY.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Plin.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Sir Pepper, what have you to communicate? Nothing I presume very entertain∣ing?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir P. Plin.</SPEAKER>
<P>You now receive a positive order, not to admit that literary fop any more into your study:</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Plin.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, Sir Pepper! When the ray of knowlege begins to dawn, must it expire at your uncreating word?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir P. Plin.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your Ladyship's metaphorical ex∣pressions
<PB N="44" REF="48"/>have no effect upon me, and give me leave to observe, that I have always found you refrac∣tory and uncomplying with any requests.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Plin.</SPEAKER>
<P>How can you be so unjust? Where is the wife throughout Wales that is more com∣placent? Did I ever refuse to comply with a re∣quest of yours, from January to January? Indeed, Sir Pepper, I might complain of the very few in∣dulgences you ever granted me—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir P. Plin.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dare you complain of my want of indulgence, when there is not a whim, that I have not always been ready to indulge you in! When the gardening parson from England came to us last year, did I not submit to have the front of my old forest, cicatrised into clumbs like large pies? Did he not fling a confining belt, as he called it, round my place! As if he thought the hills, vales and woods were going to run away! Did I not let him, to please you, zig zag the avenue in such a manner, that I could hardly find the way to my own house?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Plin.</SPEAKER>
<P>You must allow that Plinlimmon Castle, wanted a touch of the modern bard.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir P. Plin.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then I was obliged to endure his perpetual panegyric upon himself! How he was admitted to all the great tables in town? How he chose a picture for this Lord—and a fan for that Lady—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Plin.</SPEAKER>
<P>However, his visit was not long, he stayed with us but a little month.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir P. Plin.</SPEAKER>
<P>If it had not been for the death of the french cook, he would have been at Plin∣limmon Castle at this moment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Plin.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do you choose to put my patience to any further trial?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir P. Plin.</SPEAKER>
<P>Recall, if you please, the physician from the north, who came a practise-hunting into wales, did he not come twice a day to the
<PB N="45" REF="49"/>Castle to brace your nerves; was not this another indulgence? There you passed day after day, lan∣guishing on a sopha! Then the room for sooth was darkened. As you could endure only a kind of twilight, which you called <HI>a jour doux;</HI> then I was never to be admitted, because I spoke so loud.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady B.</SPEAKER>
<P>The doctor said you was too boister∣ous, Sir Pepper, for the chamber of a valetudina∣rian, notwithstanding your incredulity concerning the bad state of my nerves, at that time, I can assure you, that it was to the sopha, and to the doctor, that I owe—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir P. Plin.</SPEAKER>
<P>More than you will choose to allow.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Plin.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don't be scurrilous, Sir Pepper.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir P. Plin.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then there was the fencible colo∣nel, but I have done. Let me only entreat you not to complain any more of my not granting you any indulgences! Zounds, madam, the Pope at Rome could not have granted you more indul∣gences than I have. But no more, I have only to beg of you to stay here till I return with some papers for you to sign, and which Lord Melcourt and Mr. Fashion are to witness.</P>

<P>I confess, at least, your presumption does not offend me; but I am sorry to inform you that you must not stay with me at present; Sir Pepper is returning immediately, and Lord Mel∣court and Mr. Fashion are coming with him.</P>

<P>Pray, Lord Melcourt, have you a Virgil on those shelves behind the curtain? Tombstone and I had a dispute about a passage in the fourth book.</P>

<P>No! That is a mere lady's library, nothing but moderns—I ran up a few shelves, and furnished them with some every-day volumes for the convenience of any lady who might oc∣cupy these apartments.</P>

<P>Allow me to indulge Fashion's cu∣riosity.

<P>Gentlemen, you may laugh if you please, but we enterprising fellows are now and then exposed to these untoward discoveries. They are inevitable incidents in the comedy of life. This is an incident—</P>

<P>Arrogant pedant! If this was not Lord Melcourt's house, my cane would chastise your insolence.</P>

<SPEAKER>Lady Plin.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Sir Pepper, since we are among friends, I give you my word, that if ever I could be persuaded to deviate from the path of de∣corum, and make a little <HI>faux pas,</HI> it should not be with a literary person.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Fash.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your Ladyship is perfectly right. The literary heroes are not renowned in the an∣nals of gallantry; a bookworm is a poor harmless creature, without a sting,</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir P. Plin.</SPEAKER>
<P>What you say, Mr. Fashion, is sen∣sible and judicious. I have heard it observed, that a lieutenant of the guards is more formidable to a married man, than the whole body of the anti∣quarian society. Mr. Tombstone will excuse the warmth I was just now surprised into.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Mr. Phrensy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray do not mention it. Your prohibition with regard to my coming to this apart∣ment shall be strictly obeyed, and I shall for the future look for the honour of your Ladyship's so∣ciety only in the drawing-room, which you know is a neutral apartment, and accessible to every part of the family.</P>

<P>What do you call deficiencies?

<P>You are calm and philosophic; but I cannot be cooled and philosophised into the ap∣proval of what I am sensible is not strictly honour∣able; which is leading, and as it were betraying a young woman to the altar, for whom I entertain no passion, no preference, no esteem.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Mr. Fash.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your good nature will prompt you to treat her with civility; her simplicity will ex∣plain your politeness into love; and the torrent of amusements in town will prevent her prying into your private pleasure-ground.</P>

<P>Fashion, you talk it well; but I do protest, if I could be prevailed upon to marry this young woman, disliking her as I do, I should feel

<P>I have a scheme—a lucky thought occurred this morning. I think I have hit upon a method of escaping from the chains I have been forging for myself; and in preparing the girl for the event, I shall contrive to soften her disappoint∣ment by a kind of innocent imposition, which will make her believe that the breaking off the intended marriage is her own act.</P>

<P>What does your Lordship say?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Mel.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am afraid, Miss Plinlimmon, there are other objectionable circumstances relative to myself; with all the appearance of affability and condescension, I can assure you, that I am most vehemently passionate.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Plin.</SPEAKER>
<P>Matrimony will cure that vice! I have heard my mamma say, that marriage is a great tamer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Mel.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have also the misfortune of walk∣ing in my sleep, and I get out of the window, and walk upon the roof of the house.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Plin.</SPEAKER>
<P>As long as you do not insist upon my walking with you, I do not call that an objec∣tionable circumstance: and when you are tired of

<SPEAKER>Miss Plin. </SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(Rising.)</STAGE>
<P>Quite the reverse; your candour endears you the more to me; and to re∣turn you an equivalent of candour and unreserve, on my part, I will unfold to your Lordship a secret, though I am unwilling to disclose it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Mel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, what have you to communi∣cate?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Plin.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis what you would have found out, if I did not reveal it: but in this charming moment of mutual confidence, I cannot resist tell∣ing my love, that I have crooked legs;</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Mel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Crooked legs! The devil.</P>
</SP>

<P>Do not let such a trifle discompose you: my aunt, Lady Waddle, is made just the same as I am, and she has eleven children.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Mel.</SPEAKER>
<P>If you please, Miss Plinlimmon, we will put an end to this discourse.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Plin.</SPEAKER>
<P>If you desire it. We shall have time enough to talk, when we are man and wife: adieu, I am going to Lady Bellair, and will tell her all that has passed, in this delightful, confidential in∣tercourse.</P>

<P>I must insist upon your not revealing one word, to Lady Bellair, of what I have been saying to you.</P>

<P>Suppose while I am unwinding her affections and desires from you, I should endea∣vour to bottom, and twist them round myself?</P>

<P>What! you marry her? Are you in earnest? Will you quit your free roving pleasure-boat, for the monotonous hulk of matrimony?</P>

<P>Her guineas will decorate and enliven the hulk.</P>

<P>Well, if you can make a proselyte of the girl, you have my full permission, and best wishes; here is my license, which with a change of a name will serve your purpose, and you may get married immediately, without acquainting any of the family of it.</P>

<P>Was there ever such a Hottentot?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir P. Plin.</SPEAKER>
<P>You don't appear, Lord Mel∣court, to be struck with the artless manner of my girl.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Mel.</SPEAKER>
<P>I ask your pardon, I am exceedingly struck!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir P. Plin.</SPEAKER>
<P>She has a few rusticities adhering to her, all which will drop from her, like dross from gold.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Mel.</SPEAKER>
<P>In the crucible of Lady Bellair's re∣fining conversation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir P. Plin.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very true. I am certain Lady Bellair would perform miracles on my daughter— if she pleased.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady B.</SPEAKER>
<P>But why, Sir Pepper, do you doubt my inclination?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir P. Plin.</SPEAKER>
<P>Because you, fine ladies, dislike trou∣ble. I will be bold to say, that in the course of the winter, you never do any thing your inclina∣tion, that is to say, your vanity does not prompt you to do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady B.</SPEAKER>
<P>I ask your pardon, Sir Pepper.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir P. Plin.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indulge for once an old man's cu∣riosity, and edify me by recording some instances where you act in opposition to the dictates of your inclination.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Mel.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is a perfect challenge.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, let me recollect. I go every other Sunday, in the early part of the evening to
<PB N="59" REF="63"/>an old aunt, who lives at the Antipodes of the fash∣ionable part of the town, and there I retail to her the historic scandal of the fortnight; and then she reads to me through her green spectacles, out of a folio, a sermon of the last century.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Mel.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope, Sir Pepper, you will give Lady Bellair some credit for that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then I go once in the winter to the Ancient Music.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir P. Plin.</SPEAKER>
<P>That, I suppose, is a concert per∣formed by the decayed musicians.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not exactly so; it is, however, a very edifying concert, and composed of those hoary, venerable notes, that in days of yore delighted the ears of Harry the eighth and Anne Bullen, and is now a very suitable recreation for old batchelors, old maids, and emigrant nuns! But to continue the narrative of my mortified inclination: my carriage every morning makes one of the long procession of coaches that besiege the circulating library in Bond Street.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir P. Plin.</SPEAKER>
<P>That denotes your Ladyship's fondness for literature.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady B.</SPEAKER>
<P>I beg yor pardon, Sir Pepper, litera∣ture is my aversion; I never look into a book, but I cannot avoid calling every morning at the library; it is a kind of literary tavern, where the waiters are in perpetual demand. A dish of ele∣gant sonnets for Miss Simper; satires with a poig∣nant sauce for Mrs. Grumble; a sirloin of history for Lady Sleepless; a broil'd devil of private anec∣dote, highly peppered with scandal, for Lady An∣gelica Worthless. It would amuse you, Sir Pep∣per, to see these female academics enter the porch of Hookham College, their cheeks, paled by stu∣dy, a little relieved by a thin stratum of morning rouge. Then you would wonder at the method the learned professors adopt of supplying the im∣patience of their pupils: for example—one lady
<PB N="60" REF="64"/>receives the first volume of an author, of which she will never enquire for the second; at the same time she receives the second volume of another author, of which she has not yet an idea of the first.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir P. Plin.</SPEAKER>
<P>Give me leave to observe, this vague method of reading must create a kind of chaos, without consistency.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Consistency is a vulgar word, we do not admit into our vocabulary; and as for the chaos you disapprove of, I really think there is to be found the whole merit; for this miscellaneous, variegated, unconnected reading, forms the beautiful dove∣tailed, mosaic literature of the female mind.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir P. Plin.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope you will allow Lady Plin∣limmon to be a brilliant exception to your general description.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Most undoubtedly; I have a long list of exceptions. But not to interrupt the narrative of my own memoirs—I am sometimes obliged to mingle with the elegant mob at a sale of pic∣tures.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir P. Plin.</SPEAKER>
<P>A sale of pictures must be very improving. You there frequently meet with the works of the old masters.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady B.</SPEAKER>
<P>The ladies of fashion do not go to auctions for the sake of the <HI>old</HI> masters; do they, Lord Melcourt?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Mel.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, indeed! A bow from Lord Gauze, a smile from Lord Flimsy, or a compliment from Sir Gossamer Bagatelle, effaces the names of Rembrant, Corregio, and Vandyke!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady B.</SPEAKER>
<P>However, we play with the catalogue, and we stare at the pictures. And I have heard it observed, that in the two late celebrated sales, the love of Vertú made the ladies gaze at some pictures, from which their grand-mammas would have turned away.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir P. Plin.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="61" REF="65"/>
<SPEAKER>Lady B.</SPEAKER>
<P>But then, I will say for the ladies, that they stole a glance at these pictures, through the medium of their long veils, which you know trans∣mits a kind of drapery, to the paintings! But to proceed, I am under the obligation, sometimes, of getting up in the middle of the night, to be in readiness, to go to a new play, and with all my precaution, I never can get there before the middle of the second act.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir P. Plin.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is very unlucky.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not in the least; for I never listen to the play.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir P. Plin.</SPEAKER>
<P>But does not your talking loud in the first row, disturb the audience?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady B.</SPEAKER>
<P>I never occupy the first row; I place the old ladies, in the first and second row, they have nothing to do, (poor things) but to listen to the play? And then I sit snug on the last form, which we call among ourselves, tattle row, and then perhaps, I am seated between Sir Voluble Prattle, and Colonel Easy, and we three converse and titter <HI>a la sourdine,</HI> the whole evening: but I am afraid I grow dull.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir P. Plin.</SPEAKER>
<P>Quite the reverse, I assure you; I presume, your Ladyship pays more attention to the opera; the softness of the Italian language, has something enchanting to a delicate ear.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady B.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know nothing of the Italian lan∣guage, there is no attaining the knowledge of it, without passing through the perplexing, jumbling, cross-roads of a grammar; that would shake my intellects to pieces.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir P. Plin.</SPEAKER>
<P>Still the music may flatter the ear, though you do not comprehend the words.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady B.</SPEAKER>
<P>I comprehend the music as little as I do the words.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir P. Plin.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is, then, the dancing I conclude delights you—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="62" REF="66"/>
<SPEAKER>Lady B.</SPEAKER>
<P>No; the dancing does not particularly interest me; indeed I cannot see the dancing in my box, for I generally sit with my back to the stage.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir P. Plin.</SPEAKER>
<P>As neither the music, nor the dancing has any allurement, I suppose your Lady∣ship seldom or never goes to the opera.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady B.</SPEAKER>
<P>I ask your pardon, Sir Pepper, I never omit an opera.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir P. Plin.</SPEAKER>
<P>What then can be the attraction? I really see nothing to entice you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is it nothing, Sir Pepper, to lean half out of one's box; with the head inclined to give the easy feather a more graceful play? which looks a meteor, waving in the air; and which, as the poet says,
<Q><L>"Allures attention, from the tuneful scene;</L>
<L>"Gives fops the flutter, and old maids the spleen."</L></Q>
Is it nothing, Sir Pepper, to have all the opera glasses levelled at one? To sit in my box, as on a throne, the unrivalled queen of Fopland?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Mel.</SPEAKER>
<P>I must confess, Lady Bellair, you have an extensive dominion; Fopland is a very populous country.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady B.</SPEAKER>
<P>So it is, and what is still better, there is not an old man to be found in it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir P. Plin.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am sorry, I am excluded from being one of your majesty's subjects?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Out of regard to your gallantry, I will introduce a bill to naturalise you, Sir Pepper, but not to lose the thread of my narrative, I must in∣form you, that I go once in the winter to an assem∣bly, given by the wife of my physician; there all his pale convalescents stalk about like ghosts;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Mel.</SPEAKER>
<P>And to conclude the description; the lemonade is intentionally made so acid that the doctor is obliged to return all the visits of his company the next day.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="63" REF="67"/>
<SPEAKER>Sir P. Plin.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very good indeed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady B.</SPEAKER>
<P>You perceive what a mortified life I am obliged to lead.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir P. Plin.</SPEAKER>
<P>If your historic pencil has drawn a true resemblance, I must confess, a fashionable lady is to me an incomprehensible being.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Exit.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now we have got rid of the ridiculous baronet, I must assume a graver tone; you know, I can be very serious when occasion demands. The more I see of Sir Pepper's absurd daughter, the more I am sensibly affected at the thought of your approaching nuptials. The long train of pe∣culiar distresses incident to our family, I wish not to see terminated by means so unworthy and igno∣nimous.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Mel.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not comprehend you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady B.</SPEAKER>
<P>By marrying a young woman you are ashamed of; our family has been long involved in various difficulties; it has been known to misfor∣tune, but it has never been acquainted with dis∣honor? Imagine two large portals opening before you, through one of which, you should be obliged to pass! Imagine one presenting to your view a brilliant perspective, a sun streaming from a sum∣mer sky, and illuminating an earthly paradise! The other unfolding to your vision, a lowring atmosphere hanging over a blasted heath. Pic∣ture to yourself these words, engraved on the first portal; <HI>they who pass through me, must cast away honor.</HI>—Fancy on the other, you behold this in∣scription—<HI>This road leads, to honorable poverty;</HI> through which of these arches, would you direct your footsteps? Oh! my dear brother, in the agita∣tion you betray, I read your heroic answer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Mel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Before you had communicated your sentiments to me, upon this subject, I had made my reflection, and had resolved, but Mr. Fashion, whom I am glad to see, <STAGE>(<HI>Enter</HI> FASHION.)</STAGE> will
<PB N="64" REF="68"/>best unfold the plan we had formed together, I refer you to him, the confusion I am at present under, will excuse my leaving you so abruptly.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Exit.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Fash.</SPEAKER>
<P>Heyday, what is the matter with Melcourt? He stalked by me, in dumb shew, like a tragedy hero.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady B.</SPEAKER>
<P>The agitation you perceive he is in, is the honest working of nature, it will do him no harm; my brother tells me, you have something to communicate to me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Fash.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have, and it is of importance, I was commissioned by him, as he did not choose to speak himself, that he is determined to break off this match.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady B.</SPEAKER>
<P>He partly intimated his resolution. But who undertakes to inform the girl of his re∣solution?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Fash.</SPEAKER>
<P>That falls to my part in the play.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady B.</SPEAKER>
<P>What do you propose saying to the poor girl? How will you open your unpleasant embassy?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Fash.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not so unpleasant, because I intend to propose myself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Propose yourself!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Fash.</SPEAKER>
<P>As I do not occupy so high a station in life as Lord Melcourt, I mean, by proposing myself, to be a kind of a parachute, and so break, as it were, her fall.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady B.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are very kind, indeed. You may not perhaps be so invincible in the eyes of the young lady as you are in your own.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Fash.</SPEAKER>
<P>I rely on your friendly assistance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady B.</SPEAKER>
<P>There you are mistaken. But do not impute my declining to co-operate with you, to a fear that this may be the means of withdrawing your assiduities and attentions from me. I hope I act from a more noble impulse. I am ready to confess that the exclusive preference and predilec∣tion
<PB N="65" REF="69"/>you have shewn me of late, have gratified my vanity; but like the waves that beat against the heedless rock, they have not shook my constancy to the man whose name I bear.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Fash.</SPEAKER>
<P>The playful gaiety of your disposi∣tion led me astray, and I thought you was delighted to return to society unaccompanied by Lord Bell∣air.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady B.</SPEAKER>
<P>I own I have the appearance of airiness and levity; but my gaiety is frequently assumed, and I have recourse to dissipation more as a medicine than a feast.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Fash.</SPEAKER>
<P>As you are so kind as to speak to me in so unreserved a manner, I think it incumbent on me to declare that I have no inbred aversion to the girl. I am not so fastidious, so difficult, as Melcourt; and I will add, that was I to succeed, I would do every thing in my power to contribute to her happiness, and give me also leave to say that I believe I am not indifferent to her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady B.</SPEAKER>
<P>With such honorable sentiments as you now assure me you entertain, you have my permission to make the trial. Mutual propensity, believe me, is the best security for happiness. The smiling flowers she scatters from her hand can alone enliven the domestic walk! 'Tis she who displays to the bride and bridegroom that eternal spring which all lovers talk of, but which so few expe∣rience! 'Tis she who gilds and dissipates the clouds of care, and pours upon the soul the chear∣ful sunshine of the mind.</P>

<SPEAKER>Miss Plin.</SPEAKER>
<P>These letters are not intended for to-day's post, nor to morrow's post; but they are intended for the post the day after the wedding. You must know that I am bound by a solemn pro∣mise to write two letters the day after my mar∣riage, and as we shall be on our road to Ireland on that day, and consequently shall have no time to write, I thought it would be a good plan to write beforehand, and date the letters after the wedding,

<SPEAKER>Mr. Fash.</SPEAKER>
<P>But permit me to ask, how do you foresee you will have a bad head-ache?</P>

<SPEAKER>Miss Plin.</SPEAKER>
<P>I heard my mamma-in-law say that she had a terrible head-ache, the day after she married, so 'tis very probable—</P>

<P>I perceive there is another letter; who is honored with this mark of your remem∣brance?</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Sweet Academic Friend,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>Aurora, yesterday, put on her best saf∣fron robe, to assist at our wedding: we are on our road to Ireland, my lord, you know, is a na∣tive of that kingdom, what a delightful country must that be, which produces such men? Last night three minutes before twelve, I ascended the expecting couch.</P>
</LETTER>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Fash.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very happy expression that!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Plin.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am glad you are pleased with it, the expecting couch, is in the manner and style of our academic society; but to proceed: <STAGE>(reads)</STAGE><Q>History informs us, my dear Miss Bluehose, of the bed of Procustes, of the bed of Ware, of the <HI>Lit de Justice,</HI> and of the bed of honor; I wonder that in this learned catalogue, the historian omitted the bed of Hymen.</Q></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Fash.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is an unpardonable omission, in∣deed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss. Plin.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now we have done with the letters, be so good as to inform me why you look so serious? I begin to think, you envy Lord Mel∣court —well, if you do, I will tell you, for your comfort, that if I was to be a widow, and had
<PB N="69" REF="73"/>moulted away my black feathers, that is to say, when I had shed my weeds and got rid of my sorrow, I really think you would stand a good chance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Fash.</SPEAKER>
<P>You flatter me extremely, but to advert to the subject, which induced me to beg this private audience, I must inform you that no∣thing but the great respect I entertain for you, could compel me to mention Lord Melcourt, in terms not the most favourable.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Plin.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know what you allude to, but he has promised papa, never to touch a card again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Fash.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not allude to his passion for gaming, I point to quite a different thing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Plin.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know what you mean there too, he has told me all; he clambers up the roof of the house every night.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Fash.</SPEAKER>
<P>Clambers up the roof of the house! I can't tell what he has chosen to communicate to you, but I dare say, he has not given you any hint of what my regard for you prompts me to reveal; to keep you no longer in suspense, Melcourt does not love you; I can scarcely suppress my indig∣nation, when I behold so enchanting, so learned, so witty a young lady as Miss Plinlimmon be∣come—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Plin.</SPEAKER>
<P>How kind you are!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Fash.</SPEAKER>
<P>Become, I say, the dupe of that indi∣gent peer, who only wishes to have his debts paid by your fortune. He will look upon you with no greater sensibility than he does his old banker in the city: he will set you aside, like an useless piece of lumber.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Plin.</SPEAKER>
<P>You petrify me, Mr. Fashion! But I have a resource left, which will prevent my be∣ing reduced to an useless piece of lumber.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Fash.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what is that resource?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="70" REF="74"/>
<SPEAKER>Miss. Plin.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is a resource which belongs to the rights of women; a curtain lecture.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Fash.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! that will have no effect.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Plin.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know that my mamma-in-law has frequent recourse to that expedient.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Fash.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what has been her success? Her nocturnal murmurings, and her loud matin song, what have they produced, but an airy, talkative family of bickerings and discontent?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Plin.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis very true.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Fash.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have frequently been astonished at Lord Melcourt's cold indifference towards you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Plin.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed he has not said one kind word to me since I have been at Melcourt Hall.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Fash.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then the vehemence of his cha∣racter—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Plin.</SPEAKER>
<P>He told me himself he was as cross as the devil.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Fash.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then I have wondered at the con∣tempt with which he presumes to speak of you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Plin.</SPEAKER>
<P>I dare say he laughs at me behind my back.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Fash.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have heard him say you are an ideot.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Plin.</SPEAKER>
<P>I an ideot! Did he dare call me an ideot? I, who am one of the female academics at Carnarvon! I an ideot, with whom Miss Bluehose corresponds? I an ideot, who have been electri∣fied, and magnetised! I an ideot, who am ac∣quainted with Mr. Omega, the famous Jew bota∣nist, and have feasted as his house upon his He∣brew roots?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Fash.</SPEAKER>
<P>Notwithstanding all these credentials of your wit, you find what he says of you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Plin.</SPEAKER>
<P>I feel the blood of the Plinlimmons rise within me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Fash.</SPEAKER>
<P>I should not be surprised, if under the idea of your being an ideot, he should confine
<PB N="71" REF="75"/>you in some old castle in Ireland, without allowing you pen, ink or paper, to write to your friend, Miss Bluehose; without having the pleasure of being magnetised; and without ever having the gratification of dining upon Hebrew roots.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Plin.</SPEAKER>
<P>I renounce him from this moment! With this breath <STAGE>(blows through her fingers)</STAGE> I blow away all my love! Imagine you see it float∣ing through the air, never to return to Lord Mel∣court again!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Fash.</SPEAKER>
<P>Methinks I behold the fairy chariot bearing away your affections! Oh! that I could arrest the richly freighted vehicle, and seize the invaluable prize.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Plin.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed? Are you in earnest?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Fash.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am, upon my honour!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Plin.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! but you are so wild, and you love all the women!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Fash.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am like other young men, when under no particular engagement; like a bird in the grove, I wing from bough to bough; but once married, I should be as domestic and as constant as the turtle-dove.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Plin.</SPEAKER>
<P>If it be so, I could be almost in∣duced—</P>

<P>I am astonished to hear Lady Bellair encourage a rustic notion that is unknown to the regions of fashion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your Ladyship must allow that mutual happiness is the end proposed. 'Tis the mark, which if the bride and bridegroom in the higher sphere do not hit, it is because they take a false aim.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Plin.</SPEAKER>
<P>Morality, too!</P>

<P>Am not I an instance of the folly of hurrying into an unavoidable engagement?</P>
</SP>

<P>Not in the least. Does not the world encircle you with all its attractions? Do you not enjoy the advantages of wedlock, without the incumbrances?—your Lord's title, and a hand∣some allowance?</P>

<P>Give me leave to ask in what man∣ner your Ladyship can be supposed to be a suf∣ferer from your being separated from Lord Bellair? Do your jewels shine less bright? Is the ostrich-feather on your cap less playful? Is the lace—</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Phrensy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I do, as soon as I have, by means of my subscription) completed my poetical loan; my return to life will be a kind of an ova∣tion: the triumphal procession shall begin with my odes, each on his fiery Pegasus; my satires, like tomahawks, shall next appear; then my ele∣gies shall move like a weeping train of female captives, to these shall succeed my epigrams, a brisk troop of archers, with their pointed darts; my grand epic like a large unwieldy elephant, shall march by itself: then my tragedies, attired as widows, shall walk on one side, while my gaily vested comedies shall trip on the other.</P>

<LG>
<L>WITH gloomy bodings for his bantling play,</L>
<L>Our Author came to me the other day,</L>
<L>A boon to ask, tho' half afraid to break it;</L>
<L>He'd got an Epilogue, and I must speak it.—</L>
<L>All means he fain would try, if not too late,</L>
<L>Still to avert his dread, impending fate.</L>
<L>Sad visions, too, distract his anxious brain;</L>
<L>Rumours of ills, that wait the scribbling train.</L>
<L>'Tis said your taste for Comedy is flown;</L>
<L>That darling child you once were proud to own:</L>
<L>That Shakespear's fires no more your senses rouze;</L>
<L>Congreve and Vanbrugh seldom fill the house;</L>
<L>While childish pageants stuff the crouded scene,</L>
<L>No mortal even guessing what they mean;</L>
<L>Fierce wars they wage, and dreadful battles try,</L>
<L>With bloodless conflict: all one knows not why.</L>
<L>Till by the friendly banners we are told,</L>
<L>There Macedon's, there Persia's chief behold!</L>
<L>Just as on signs th' informing words declare,</L>
<L>This the Red Lion; that is the Black Bear.</L>
<L>Queens, and their maids of honor, wait in vain.</L>
<L>Till their mute lovers shall their suit explain.</L>
<L>They'd often heard, indeed from Greece and Rome,</L>
<L><PB N="79" REF="83"/>That love was blind; but ne'er that he was dumb.</L>
<L>There too those motly, female, manly graces,</L>
<L>With almost all things naked, but their faces;</L>
<L>Those modern Picts, at whom we gaze with wonder;</L>
<L>While their keen falchions cut whole ranks asunder.</L>
<L>Great Rusty-fusti's triumphs thus we greet;</L>
<L>Six holy Roman emp'rors breathless at her feet.</L>
<L>Nor less the neighb'ring temples of Apollo,</L>
<L>With equal steps the bright example follow.</L>
<L>There beardless warriors squeak each other's doom;</L>
<L>And silken Vandals plan the fall of Rome.</L>
<L>There demigods by entrechâts advance,</L>
<L>And Carthage flames demolish'd in a dance.</L>
<L>Arms clash, loud thunders roar, and chariots rattle;</L>
<L>While jarring trumpets animate the battle.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now critics, if you're angry think on these,</L>
<L>And spare the bard who strives at least to please:</L>
<L>Judge, and be judg'd, in anger just, I pray:</L>
<L><HI>Audire alteram partem</HI> is fair play.</L>
<L>In such a cause, altho' the task be hard;</L>
<L>I'll be myself of counsel for our bard;</L>
<L>I've such authorities as none refuses,</L>
<L>Fleta's, and Coke's, and Blackstone's of the Muses;</L>
<L>Farqhuar and Rowe, and Wycherly we boast!</L>
<L>And Avon's mighty seer, himself a host!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet, for I feel my female fears increase,</L>
<L>Tho' arm'd for war, <HI>yet still I wish</HI> for peace:</L>
<L>We own your pow'r, confess your wond'rous sway,</L>
<L>Whom all our great dramatic realms obey:</L>
<L><PB N="80" REF="84" MS="y"/>No merit we can claim, till you befriend it,</L>
<L>Wit is not wit, unless your taste commend it:</L>
<L>From th' Author's anvil a mere sluggish mass;</L>
<L>Your plaudits stamp the coin, and bid it pass.</L>
<L>By your mild sentence then decide our fate:</L>
<L>Far better to be good than to be great!</L>
<L>Like Britain's Monarch, act your generous parts,</L>
<L>And fix your empire, in our greatful hearts.</L>
