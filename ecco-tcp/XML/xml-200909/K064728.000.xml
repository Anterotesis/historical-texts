<P>THE APPRENTICE. A FARCE, IN TWO ACTS, As it is Perform'd at the THEATRE-ROYAL, in <HI>Drury-Lane.</HI></P>
<P>By Mr. MURPHY.</P>

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THERE was Room to apprehend, be∣fore the Representation of the following Farce, that the Subject might appear extravagant and merely ideal; but the real ex∣istence of it is displayed in such a lively and picturesque Manner by the Author of the Prologue, and was at once so universally felt by the Audience, that all necessity of saying any thing farther on this Head is now entirely superseded. What at present remains to be feared, is, that the <HI>Apprentice</HI> will not make so lively a figure in the closet, as on the Stage, where the Parts in general were allow∣ed to be well performed; where <HI>Simon</HI> was re∣presented with a perfection of folly, where the Skill of Mr. <HI>Yates</HI> exhibited the Impo∣tence of a Mind, whose Ideas extend very little beyond the multiplication Table, and whose Passions are ever in a crazy Conflict, unless when they all subside into a sordid Love of Gain; and where Mr. <HI>Woodward's</HI> admirable comic Genius gave such a Spirit to the whole, that there is Reason to think, when∣ever he relinquishes the Part, the <HI>Apprentice</HI> may again elope from his Friends, without any one's desiring him to Return to his Business.</P>
<P>The Author has however endeavoured to render all its Defects as excusable as he could, and he wishes no stronger Criticism could be brought against him, than the two following Observations, which he thinks very singular and somewhat entertaining. <Q><HI>I can't,</HI> says one, <HI>give my Opinion of the Piece, till I have</HI>
<PB REF="3"/>
Time to consider the Depth of it</Q>—<Q><HI>Po!</HI> says another, <HI>this is not all his</HI> OWN, <HI>I remember some of it in other Plays.</HI></Q>—In order to assist the former in his deep Researches, and to enable the latter to make good his charge of Plagia∣rism, References are made to the several Plays, from which the distempered Hero of the piece makes up his motley, but characteristick Dia∣lect. The intelligent Reader, if he think it worth his while to turn over these Leaves, will be pleased to remember that a Parody does not always carry with it a Burlesque on the Lines al∣luded to. For (as it is judiciously remarked in a note to Mr. <HI>Pope's</HI> Dunciad) <Q><HI>It is a common, but foolish, mistake that a ludicrous Parody of a grave and celebrated Passage; is a Ridicule of that Passage. A Ridicule indeed there is in every Parody, but where the Image is transfer∣red from one Object to another, there the Ri∣dicule falls not on the Thing</HI> imitated, <HI>but</HI> imitating. <HI>Thus for Instance, when</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A Line of pope's in a ludicrous Account of the coronation in Henry the VIIIth.</NOTE> <HI>Old Edward's Armour beams on Cibbers Breast.</HI> It is without Doubt an Object ridiculous enough; but then, I think, <HI>it falls neither on old King</HI> Edward, <HI>nor his</HI> Armour, <HI>but on his</HI> Armour-Bearer <HI>only.</HI></Q></P>
<P>But this is prefacing a Farce as if it were a Thing of moment; I shall therefore dismiss it to the Press, without adding any Thing far∣ther, except my grateful Acknowledgements for the very favourable Reception, with which the Public has honoured the trifling Scenes of</P>

<L>The <HI>Culprit</HI> of this Night, appears before ye.</L>
<L>Before his Judges dares these Boards to tread,</L>
<L>"With all his Imperfections on his Head!"</L>
<L>Prologues precede the <HI>Piece,</HI>—in mournful Verse;</L>
<L>As Undertakers — walk before the Hearse.</L>
<L>Whose doleful March may strike the harden'd Mind,</L>
<L>And wake it's feelings — for the Dead — behind.</L>
<L>Trickt out in Black thus Actors try their Art,</L>

<L>No smuggled, pilfer'd Scenes from France we show,</L>
<L>'Tis English — English, Sirs! — from Top to Toe.</L>
<L>Tho' Coarse my Colours and my Hand unskill'd,</L>
<L>From real life my little Cloth is fill'd.</L>
<L>My Hero is a Youth, — by Fate design'd</L>
<L><HI>For culling simples,</HI> — but whose Stage-struck Mind,</L>
<L>Nor <HI>Fate</HI> could <HI>rule,</HI> nor his <HI>Indentures</HI> bind.</L>

<L>A Very pretty Bill, — as I'm alive!</L>
<L>The Part of — Nobody — by Mrs. <HI>Clive!</HI></L>
<L>A paltry, scribling Fool — to have me out —</L>
<L>He'll say perhaps — he thought I could not <HI>spout.</HI></L>
<L>Malice and Envy to the last Degree!</L>
<L>And why? — I wrote a Farce as well as He.</L>
<L>And fairly ventur'd it, — without the Aid</L>
<L>Of Prologue dress'd in black, and Face in Masquerade;</L>
<L>O Pit — have Pity — see how I'm dismay'd!</L>
<L>Poor Soul! — this canting Stuff will never do,</L>
<L>Unless, like Bay's, he brings his Hangman too.</L>
<L>But <HI>granting</HI> that from these same Obsequies,</L>
<L>Some Pickings to our Bard in black arise;</L>
<L>Should your Applause to Joy convert his Fear,</L>
<L>As Pallas turns to feast — <HI>Lardella's Bier;</HI></L>
<L>Yet 'twould have been a better Scheme by half</L>
<L>T'have thrown his Weeds aside, and learn't with me to laugh.</L>
<L>I could have shewn him, had he been inclin'd,</L>
<L>A spouting Junto of the Female Kind.</L>
<L>There dwells a Milliner in yonder Row,</L>
<L>Well-dress'd, full-voic'd, and nobly built for Shew,</L>
<L>Who, when in Rage, she scolds at <HI>Sue</HI> and <HI>Sarah,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Damn'd, Damn'd Dissembler!</HI> — thinks she's more than <HI>ZARA.</HI></L>
<L><PB REF="7"/>She has a Daughter too that deals in Lace,</L>
<L>And sings — O <HI>Ponder</HI> well — and <HI>Cherry Chase,</HI></L>
<L>And fain would fill the fair <HI>Ophelia</HI>'s Place.</L>
<L>And in her cock't up Hat, and Gown of Camblet,</L>
<L>Presumes on something — <HI>touching the Lord Hamlet.</HI></L>
<L>A Cousin too she has, with squinting Eyes,</L>
<L>With wadling Gait, and Voice like <HI>London Cries;</HI></L>
<L>Who, for the Stage too short by half a Story,</L>
<L>Acts Lady Townly — thus — in all her Glory.</L>
<L>And, while she's traversing her scanty Room,</L>
<L>Cries — "Lord, my Lord, what can I do at home!"</L>
<L>In short, there's Girls enough for all the Fellows,</L>
<L>The Ranting, Whining, Starting, and the Jealous,</L>
<L>The Hotspurs, Romeos, Hamlets, and Othellos.</L>
<L>Oh! Little do those silly People know,</L>
<L>What dreadful Trials — Actors undergo.</L>
<L>Myself — who most in Hamony delight,</L>
<L>Am scolding here from Morning until Night.</L>
<L>Then take Advice from me, ye giddy Things,</L>
<L>Ye Royal Milliners, ye apron'd Kings;</L>
<L>Young Men beware and shun our slipp'ry Ways,</L>
<L>Study Arithmetic, and burn your Plays;</L>
<L>And you, ye Girls, let not our Tinsel train</L>
<L>Enchant your Eyes, and turn your madd'ning Brain;</L>
<L>Be timely wise, for oh! be sure of this; —</L>
<L>A Shop with Virtue, is the Height of Bliss.</L>
