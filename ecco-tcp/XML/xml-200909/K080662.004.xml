<DIV2 TYPE="description">
<P>The Heron is one of the most common birds that inhabit this kingdom: and there is scarcely any part of the globe that has been visited by travellers, in which it has not been noticed. In Britain it was formerly held in high estimation, not only because its flesh was accounted a delicacy at the tables of the nobility<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>It appears from a curious book, entitled <HI>The Regulations of the Houshold of the Fifth Earl of</HI> NORTHUMBERLAND, <HI>begun in</HI> 1512, that Herons were valued at the same price as <HI>Bytters</HI> (Bitterns), <HI>Fessaunts</HI> (Pheasants), <HI>Curlewes</HI> (Curlews), and <HI>Peacockes</HI> (Peacocks).</P>
<P>"At PRINCIPAL FEASTS.—Item, it is thought in likewyze that HEARONSEWYS be bought for my <HI>Lordees own mees;</HI> so that they be at xiid. a pece." The price of the Crane was 16d. at the same time, and the Goose 3d. or at most 4d.—<HI>Partridges</HI> 2d. <HI>Woodcocks</HI> 1 or 1½.; and <HI>Snipes</HI> three for a penny.</P></NOTE>: but because Heron Hawking was a favourite diversion, insomuch that laws were enacted for the preservation of the species, and any person by destroying the eggs incurred a penalty of twenty shillings.</P>
<P>The plumage of the male bird is remarkable for its elegance; per∣haps we could with less propriety use the same expression, if speaking of its general appearance and proportions. Nature has not provided it with webbed feet to swim after its prey, which is almost wholly of the aquatic kind, but has furnished it with very long legs to wade after it, and these give it rather an aukward appearance when standing on the land. The neck also is long and slender, but when it stands on the side of a stream or river waiting for the passing of a fish, its neck and head are drawn between the shoulders: in flying its neck is also crouched down, and the head almost concealed between the shoulders. The male is chiefly distinguished from the female by having a fine crest of black feathers; two in particular, in some specimens, are eight
<PB REF="7"/>
inches in length. Mr. Latham believes that this appendage is found only in males of a full age, or perhaps very old birds. Mr. Pennant says that the long soft black feathers on the sides were used in old times as egrets for the hair, or ornaments to the caps of knights of the garter; and the crests of the males are now used as ornaments in the East.</P>
<P>The female has only a very short plume of dusky greyish feathers, and the loose feathers that hang over the breast are very short, while those of the other sex are long. This has been generally supposed a distinct kind: the accurate Linneus described it as another species, under the specific name <HI>cinerea,</HI> and many other naturalists have been of the same opinion, as appears by the synonyms: Mr. Pennant ob∣serves this was formerly supposed; "but later observations prove them to be the same." Mr. Latham adopts precisely the opinion of Mr. Pennant, but in neither of their accounts can we find the au∣thority on which that opinion is founded. It is worthy of remark that Albin, who lived at a time when Heronries were far more nu∣merous than at present (though even now they are very common in some parts <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"At <HI>Cres<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Hall,</HI> near <HI>Gos<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI> in <HI>Lincolnshire,</HI> I have counted eighty nests in one tree." <HI>Pennant.</HI></NOTE>), in the first volume of his Birds, has figured the male, and in the third volume the female, yet gives not the smallest reason to conclude that he did not consider them as distinct species.</P>
<P>In the breeding season they unite in large societies, and build on the highest trees. The nest is made of sticks, and lined with rushes, wool, feathers, &amp;c. They lay four, five, or six eggs, of a pale green colour. They desert the nests in the winter, and are then found on the banks of rivers, or marshy places.</P>
<P>The length is about three feet: breadth five feet; weight exceeds three pounds.</P>

<P>The length of this species is commonly about ten inches: breadth twenty-four: weight two ounces and a half. The male is known by a white spot under the chin. Mr. Latham mentions a variety, (Var A) in which the lower part of the breast, belly, thighs, under wing coverts and vent are white; and in some specimens of the common kind the white at the vent is spread towards the thighs. The webs of the feet are depressed, and form a crescent: the colour of the legs seem to vary; our bird had scarcely any of the red tinge in the black colour.</P>
<P>These birds frequent our shores in summer. Latham says they are observed on the coasts of Kent in a few days after the other terns; and, as they differ somewhat in their manners, do not associate. They are found during spring and summer in vast numbers in the fens of Lincolnshire. The eggs are three or four in number, of a greenish or olive colour, spotted with black, and have also a band of the same colour about the middle. These eggs are deposited among the reeds in fens and other marshy places. The food is in∣sects and small fish, which it procures by hovering over the water, and darting on its prey in the same manner as most other birds of the same genus.</P>
<P><PB REF="11"/>It is an inhabitant of most of the northern countries of Europe: very common in Siberia, and about the salt lakes of the desarts of Tartary. It is also supposed to be the species which was seen by <HI>Kalm</HI> in vast flocks, beyond lat. 41. north, long. 47. W. He says, "It was rather darker than the common sea-swallow; the flocks consisted of some hundreds, and sometimes settled on the ship<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide <HI>Kalm.</HI> Travels in North America, &amp;c. translated by J.

<P>It seems undetermined whether we ought to consider this as a dis∣tinct species, or only as a variety of the Sky Lark. Mr. Latham, in his Synopsis, considers it a variety, and observes that he is aware of this and other Birds becoming black by feeding on <HI>Hemp-seed,</HI> as was the case with a Goldfinch and House Sparrow. It appears also liable to much variation of colours in different specimens. One in
<PB REF="17"/>
the British Museum is of a full deep black throughout, and that from which the figure in our plate is copied, is of a lighter colour in many parts than that seems to have been from which Albin engraved his plate. The account which this Author has given is curious: "This Lark," says he, "was taken with a clap net by one of the Bird-catchers in a field near <HI>Highgate,</HI> and brought to me by <HI>Mr. Davenport,</HI> which I have taken care to draw exactly from the Bird, neither adding nor diminishing in the draught or colouring. This being a curiosity, I was desired by one of my subscribers to make a plate of it."</P>
<P>The name Albin has given it is scarcely justified by this descrip∣tion which he has added. "The bill of this Bird was of a dusky yellow; the irides of the eyes yellowish: it was all over of a dark reddish brown, inclining to black, excepting the hind part of the head, on which was some dusky yellowish feathers; likewise some feathers with whitish edges on the belly."</P>
<P>Our specimen was shot in Scotland by Mr. Agneau, Gardener to the late Duchess of Portland, several years ago. Its length rather exceeds seven inches.</P>

<P>The length of this bird is eighteen inches: breadth three feet six inches; weight seventeen ounces. It is a common bird in England, and frequents the inland rivers, fens, and moist meadows many miles distant from the sea shore in winter.</P>
<P>Mr. Pennant observes, that the gelatinous substance, known by the name of <HI>Star Shot,</HI> or <HI>Star Gelly,</HI> owes its origin to this bird, or some of the kind; being nothing but the half digested remains of Earth-Worms, on which these birds feed, and often discharge them from their stomachs.</P>

<P>This species breeds on the borders of lakes in the northern parts of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and very rarely migrates to the southward but in severe winters.

<P>It has been supposed by some authors that the Parus Ater, and Parus Palustris <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Marsh Titmouse.</NOTE> of Linnaeus were not distinct species, but merely the two sexes of one kind; and others have thought the latter only a variety of the first. Willughby is the first author worthy of con∣sideration who has noticed the precise difference between the two birds. He says the Marsh Titmouse differs from the Colemouse in these particulars: 1st, that it is bigger: 2d, that it wants the white spot on the head: 3d, it has a larger tail: 4th, its under side is white: 5th, it has less black under the chin: 6th, it wants the white spot on the covert of the wings. Mr. Pennant observes on this account given by Willughby, that the last distinction does not hold in ge∣neral, as the subject figured in the <HI>British Zoology</HI> had those spots; yet wanted that on the hind part of the head.</P>
<P><PB REF="27"/>The opinion of Mr. Latham in this particular deserves attention also; he says, "it is much to be feared that the Marsh Titmouse is not a distinct species; most probably a mere variety of the Cole∣mouse." <HI>Gen. Syn. vol.</HI> 4.</P>
<P>In the <HI>Supplement</HI> to the <HI>General Synopsis of Birds,</HI> Mr. Latham has added the following account under the head MARSH TITMOUSE. "In my <HI>Synopsis</HI> it has not appeared clear to me, whether the <HI>Cole∣mouse</HI> and this were different species. I find it to be the opinion of <HI>Sepp,</HI> that they form but one, being both figured in the same plates as <HI>male</HI> and <HI>female.</HI> In one of them is a spot of white on the hind head, and the sides of the head are white: the throat black. The other has the top of the head wholly black, and the black spot of the throat wanting. The nest seems here composed of sedge, mixed with large <HI>cat's-tail,</HI> lined with down and feathers: furnished with five white eggs, mottled with red brown.</P>
<P>The Colemouse appears to be less injurious in gardens and orchards than others of the same genus: it is also less numerous, and generally inhabits woods. The length is four inches. It is found throughout <HI>Europe</HI> and in <HI>America.</HI></P>

<P>The Nutcracker is so extremely rare in this Country, that Mr. Pennant has added it to his British Zoology, in the third plate of the Appendix of Vol. II. And as we are indebted to his authority for ascertaining its being an English species, we have transcribed his account of it.</P>
<P>"The specimen we took our description from, is the only one we ever heard was shot in these kingdoms: it was killed near <HI>Mostyn, Flintshire, October</HI> 5, 1753."</P>
<P>"It was somewhat less than the Jackdaw: the bill strait, strong, black: the colour of the whole head and neck, breast and body, was a rusty brown: the other parts marked with triangular white spots: the wings black: the coverts spotted in the same manner as the body: the tail rounded at the end, black, tipt with white: the vent-feathers white: the legs dusky."</P>
<P>Mr. Latham mentions a second instance: he saw the mutilated skin of one that was shot in Kent.</P>
<P><PB REF="31"/>It appears from different authors, that this bird is most frequent in the pine forests in Russia, Siberia, and Kamtschatka: it is also found in Germany, where it is more common than in any other part of Europe, though it inhabits the mountainous parts of Sweden and Denmark: it sometimes visits France in flocks. Found also in North America.</P>
<P>In its manners it is said to greatly resemble the Jay. It feeds on the kernels of the pine, wild berries, and insects; and makes its nest in the holes of trees.</P>

<P>The Nuthatch is a small bird: it weighs about one ounce, and is five inches and three quarters in length. The female differs from the male only in size; the weight seldom exceeding five or six drams.</P>
<P>It breeds in the hollows of trees, and lays six or seven eggs, of a dirty white colour, dotted with rufous; these are deposited on the rotten wood, mixed with a little moss. If the entrance to the nest is too large, it closes up part of it with clay, leaving only a very small hole to creep through. The nest of this bird is seldom dis∣turbed, or the eggs taken away, when the female, is sitting, for her hissing so nearly resembles that of a snake, that few would venture to put their hands into the hole to search for them; and it is said, that the female will suffer her feathers to be plucked off rather than
<PB REF="35"/>
desert her eggs or young. The male also shews the greatest tender∣ness for them and its mate, during the time of incubation.</P>
<P>It feeds on all kinds of insects, as well as nuts: of the latter, it lays up a considerable hoard in the hollows of trees, and brings them out when other food is scarce. The manner of its cracking the nut is curious, and has been noticed by several authors, and par∣ticularly <HI>Willoughby:</HI> he says, "It is a pretty sight to see her fetch a nut out of her hoard, when, placing it fast in a chink, she stands above it, with the head downwards, and, striking it with all her force, breaks the shell, and catches up the kernel."</P>
<P>In its manners, it is not unlike the Woodpecker tribe. It is not supposed to sleep perched; for, when confined in a cage, it would creep into a corner at night to sleep. Dr. Plott says, "this bird, by putting its bill into a crack in the bough of a tree, can make such a violent sound as if it was rending asunder, so that the noise may be heard at least twelve score yards."</P>
<P>It is not migratory, but changes its situation in winter. Pennant observes, that it makes a chattering noise in Autumn. Latham says, he has been informed, that it has, at times, a whistle like that of a man.</P>

<P>This pretty species is very common in the summer. It is migra∣tory; visiting this country in the spring, and departing again in autumn; but does not leave the warmer parts of Europe so early. The nest is usually made in the hollows of broken walls, or old trees: it is composed of moss, with a lining of hair and feathers; and con∣tains four, sometimes five eggs, of a light blue colour; and in other respects resembling those of the Hedge Sparrow, except that they are rather more elongated at the smallest end. This bird is so very shy that if the eggs are only touched it forsakes the nest entirely.</P>
<P>The Redstart is rather smaller than the Redbreast; measuring about five inches. The male is known by the chin, cheeks, and throat being black: in the female the chin is white; and the red colour of the breast is paler than in the male. It has one very peculiar habit,
<PB REF="39"/>
when it shakes its tail it does not move it up and down like the Wag-tail, but horizontally, or sideways, like a Dog when he is fawning. Its note is soft and pleasing; but it will not bear confinement in a cage, unless when reared from nestlings, when it requires the same treatment as the Nightingale. In the wild state it feeds on every kind of Insects.</P>

<P>The Wryneck is the only species of the genus <HI>(Yunx)</HI> yet described by any author; and seems to have given Linnaeus some trouble to determine to what genus he should assign it; for though it has the tongue of the Woodpecker, as well as the situation of the toes, the bill is too weak for that genus. Linnaeus, in the former edition of the <HI>Fauna Suecica,</HI> placed it with the Cuckow; but it appears to be the opinion of later naturalists that it should form a distinct genus, his new genus having been generally adopted. The <HI>Jyngi Congener</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Le Torcol rayé of <HI>Brisson.</HI></NOTE> of Aldravendus is certainly no other than a variety.</P>
<P>The colours are altogether very plain, but are so beautifully varied and pencilled, that, as Mr. Pennant observes, Nature has made ample amends for their want of splendor. The colours are paler in the female than the male.</P>
<P><PB REF="43"/>This bird builds in hollow trees: <HI>Latham</HI> says they make no nest, but lay the eggs on the bare rotten wood. <HI>Pennant</HI> says it makes the nest of dry grass. The eggs, according to <HI>Buffon,</HI> are as white as ivory; and <HI>Pennant</HI> adds, that they are so thin that the yolk may be seen through them. The number of eggs seldom exceed nine.</P>
<P>The Wryneck is supposed to be a Bird of passage, appearing in the spring eight or ten days earlier than the Cuckow. It feeds on Insects, and seems particularly fond of Ants; these the extreme length of the tongue enables it to pick out of the cracks where they are concealed. It takes its name from a habit it has of turning its head back to the shoulders when alarmed or terrified: it can also erect the feathers of the head like those of a Jay.—Weight of this Bird is one ounce and a quarter: length seven inches: breadth eleven.</P>
<P>This Bird is found throughout <HI>Europe,</HI> and in many other parts of the world.</P>

<P>We have only three species of Butcher-birds, or Shrikes, in this country: the Great, Red-backed, and Wood Chat. The first is very scarce: the second is not common; and the last is extremely rare: so that we have little opportunity to notice the singular manners of this tribe. Nature seems to have allotted more than an ordinary share of courage to these little creatures: they equal the eagle in the fierceness of their attacks on smaller birds, and defend themselves against those they cannot overcome with the greatest vigour and resolution. Though in this respect they imitate the larger carnivorous birds, they have not, like them, claws strong enough to tear their prey to pieces, but, to supply this defect, they fasten it on a thorn and pull it asunder with their bill. Even when confined in a cage, it is said that they treat their food in a similar manner, sticking it against the wires be∣fore they eat it.</P>
<P>We now speak of the manners generally peculiar to the tribe: how far those of the Wood Chat accord with them, we can only presume from being of the same genus; no English naturalist having yet been so fortunate as to meet with it since <HI>Willoughby</HI> and <HI>Ray.</HI>
<PB REF="47"/>
Pennant has not given a figure of it in the British Zoology; and it is a fact well known, that both Lewin and Walcot have given figures of it drawn from mere descriptions: this is the more to be regretted as no specimen of it was either in the Leverian or British Museums: and that eminent ornithologist, Mr. Latham, with his accustomed candour acknowledges, in his account of it, that he has never seen it. "Mr. <HI>Pennant,</HI>" says he, "does not describe this bird from his <HI>own</HI> inspection; and I must confess that it has never come under <HI>mine.</HI>"— He also, says <HI>Buffon,</HI> does not speak of it as uncommon, but gives it, as his opinion, that the red-backed Shrike is a variety of this species, as well as some other kinds he mentions; and adds, that from his own observation he cannot deny the fact. We have com∣pared them, and do not hesitate to give them as two distinct species.</P>
<P>It is only the male bird that we have in our possession. We must own ourselves indebted for the following description of the female to Pennant and Latham; nor are we certain that our specimen was shot in England, but rather suspect that it came from Germany.—The length is seven inches and three quarters. The female differs from the male: the upper part of the head, neck and body are reddish, striated transversely with brown: the lower parts of the body are of a dirty white, rayed with brown, marked near the end with dusky, and tipped with red.</P>

<P>This is not a very common bird in England. It is of the migra∣tory kind and never builds here: is sometimes seen in large flocks, or in company with the Chaffinches. The colours of the female are not so bright as in the male: in some specimens of the latter the throat is black. Length rather exceeds six inches. They are found in vast abundance in France according to <HI>Buffon;</HI> and are said to breed about <HI>Luxemburg,</HI> making the nest on the tall fir-trees, com∣posed of long moss without, and lined with wool and feathers within. The eggs are four or five in number, yellowish, and spotted: the young are fledged at the end of May. They are also found in the Pine forests of <HI>Russia</HI> and <HI>Siberia.</HI></P>

<P>This species has not been described by Pennant in his British Zoology, nor is it certain that any preceding author has noticed it as a British species. The Rev. Mr. Lightfoot found it near <HI>Bulstrade,</HI>
<PB REF="53"/>
in <HI>Buckinghamshire,</HI> in May and June, and it is from a specimen found by him, and presented to the late Duchess of Portland, that our figure is taken. The nest on which the bird is placed is com∣posed of dry bents mixed with wool, and lined with a few hairs of some animal, probably of a Cow. There is at present only one egg in the nest <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Latham says there were three in that which came under his inspection.</NOTE>; it is of a pale colour, with small irregular spots of brown.</P>
<P>It was the opinion of Mr. Latham, to whose inspection Mr. Light∣foot submitted this bird, that it was perhaps the <HI>Motacilla Sylvia</HI> of Linnaeus; or that certainly it differed very little from it. Mr. Pennant also seems undetermined whether the White Throat was the <HI>M. Sylvia</HI> of Linnaeus; though Berkenhout <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Outlines of Nat. Hist.</NOTE> gives it as that species without hesitation. The opinion of Mr. Latham is of the most importance; and, if it does not positively confirm our bird being the true <HI>M. Sylvia</HI> of Linnaeus, it proves, at least, that the <HI>White Throat</HI> is not that bird as has been generally supposed <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><P>"That Linnaeus's bird is not our <HI>White Throat,</HI> I believe is manifest, both from size and colours. That author expressly says, that the size scarcely exceeds that of the <HI>Yellow Wren,</HI> and that it bears great affinity to the <HI>Sedge Bird.</HI> But that the bird in question is neither the <HI>Yellow Wren,</HI> not <HI>Sedge Bird,</HI> I am clear, as I have all the three before me."</P>

<P>The male and female are very much alike. The size is that of the Yellow Wren, length less than five inches.</P>

<P>The Great Cinereous Shrike is uncommon in England. It is of the migratory kind, coming in May and departing in September. We learn from Buffon that it is not scarce in France. It is found in Germany, Russia, and North America. In Russia it is trained to catch small birds; and the peasants value it because they believe that it destroys the rats, mice, and other vermin.</P>
<P><PB REF="58"/>The savage peculiarities of this carnivorous tribe of birds have been already noticed in the account of the Wood Chat and Red-Back Shrike: it is only necessary to add that this is the largest kind found in this country, and is inferior to very few from foreign countries either in size or courage. Its conflicts with larger birds are some∣times severe; but the smaller kinds it seizes by the throat and strangles: from this circumstance it is called, in Germany, the <HI>Warchangel,</HI> or Suffocating Angel.—The female differs from the male chiefly in the colour and markings of the breast, that part being of a dusky white, and marked with a number of transverse, semicircular brown lines. She lays six eggs, of a dull olive colour, spotted at the thickest end with black. The nest is composed of heath and moss, lined with wool. In North America, at Hudson's Bay, it is said to build its nest half way up a Pine, or Juniper-tree, in April, and that the hen fits fifteen days <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lath.

<P>This is rather smaller than the House Sparrow. The female is duller in colour than the male; and has not the black marks on the side of the head and throat. In some specimens the brown colour is more intermixed with black, or dark shades, than our bird; this change of colour has been often noticed in the House Sparrow, which is sometimes quite black.</P>
<P>We must consider this as a local species; common in <HI>Lancashire, Lincolnshire,</HI> and <HI>Yorkshire</HI> on<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, in this country. It is very common in many parts of Europe: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Siberia it is more common than the <HI>House Sparrow.</HI> It frequents trees, and, according to <HI>Sepp,</HI> builds its nest in a hollow. It is composed of <HI>bents,</HI> mixed with feathers; and contains five eggs of a pale brown, with spots of a darker colour.</P>
<P>Albin scarcely knew this species, from which we may infer, that it has seldom been taken near the metropolis; he says, "This bird delights in mountainous woody places, not frequented. It was shot by a gentleman in the country, and sent in a letter to me, by the name of the Mountain Sparrow." Vol. III. p. 62.</P>

<P>This noble bird was formerly an inhabitant of the woody and mountainous parts of Scotland <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>bi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>us.—Descr.

At this time it is supposed to be extinct in Ireland; and in Scotland is found only in the Highlands north of Inverness <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Rossshire. Sutherlandshire.</NOTE>. Mr. Latham says, the last bird
<PB REF="65"/>
of this kind found in Scotland was in <HI>Chicholm</HI>'s great forest, in Strathglass.</P>
<P>Albin gave a figure of it in his Ornithology, published sixty years since, and then he seems not to have known that it was a British species; he calls it the Mountain Cock from Muscovy. From this we may infer that the breed was nearly extirpated half a century ago.</P>
<P>According to most authors it thrives best in cold countries. It is found in Italy, but only in the higher regions, where the air is bleak. In Russia it is not uncommon, particularly in the Asiatic part of that empire. There is a variety of this species much smaller than the common sort, which is probably owing to the severe cold of the climate in which it lives, being found in Lapland and Norway, the farthest extreme of Europe towards the Icy Sea.</P>
<P>The male of this species is two feet nine inches in length, breadth four feet, and is as large as a Turkey <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In Scotland it is known by the name of <HI>Capercalze, Aver-calze,</HI> and in the old law books Caperkally: the last signifying the <HI>horse of the woods.</HI> In Germany it is called Aur-han, or Urus, <HI>Wild Ox Cock.</HI>—Pennant.</NOTE>. The female is smaller, twenty six inches in length. The bill is dusky, throat red, neck and back marked with transverse bars of red and black: a few white spots on the breast, the lower part of an orange colour, belly barred with pale orange and black, the tips of the feathers white; the fea∣thers of the back and scapulars black, the edges mottled with black and pale reddish brown: the scapulars tipped with white, the inner webs of the quills dusky; the exterior mottled with pale brown: the tail of a deep rust colour, barred with black and tipped with white.</P>
<P><PB REF="66"/>These birds feed on many kinds of plants, and particularly on the tender shoots and seeds of the Pine and Fir trees, which are in the greatest plenty in the forests they frequent. The males never associate with the females, except from the beginning of February till the end of March: when the male perches on a tree, with his tail spread, the quills lowered to the feet, the neck protruded, and the feathers of the head ruffled. In this posture it makes a loud and shrill noise, like the whetting of a scythe, and this it repeats till the females dis∣cover its haunts. They lay from eight to sixteen eggs, of a white colour, spotted with yellow, and larger than those of the common hen: these are deposited upon moss, on the ground <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Latham says of the last bird of this kind shot in Scotland, "I am well in∣formed that the nest was placed on a Scotch Pine."</NOTE>. The females only, sit the whole time of incubation, and cover the eggs with dry leaves when she is compelled to leave them. The young run after the mother as soon as hatched.</P>
<P>The flesh of the Wood Grous is much esteemed, except when it feeds on the berries of Juniper which communicates a very unpleasant taste to it.</P>

<P>The Little Owl appears to be no where a common bird; in this country it is scarce, and in France, Buffon informs us, it is also rare. It is very seldom found in the woods, which others of the same tribe inhabit, but frequents ruined edifices, caverns in rocks, and other such gloomy and solitary places. It lays five eggs, spotted with white and a yellowish colour. In England it has been chiefly found in Yorkshire and Flintshire.</P>
<P>This bird seems liable to much variation in colour. Buffon men∣tions one from St. Domingo which had less white on the throat, and
<PB REF="70"/>
brown bands on the breast instead of longitudinal spots; and another variety from Germany, with the plumage darker than usual and black irides. <HI>Frisch</HI> has a figure of this bird with irides of a dark blue colour.

<P>The Hobby is found in the temperate parts of Europe. It was antiently used in falconry in this country, particularly in daring of Larks and other small birds. It is said, that the Larks never venture to take their flight in sight of this bird; but that if it hovers over them, they will remain motionless on the ground while the fowler draws a net over them.</P>
<P>We find on comparing the different descriptions given by authors of this bird, with specimens that have fallen under our observation, that few birds vary more, in the colours of their plumage, than the Hobby: in some the back is reddish, or deep brown; in others almost black with a bluish cast. Again, we find some with the back throughout of a very deep lead colour; and others with the edges of the feathers of a pale yellow-brown. The breast is generally of a pure white with dark spots; but these also vary: the white is tinged with a faint dirty-brown in some; and the spots incline to brown, instead of black, in others. The irides are brown of every shade in different birds:
<PB REF="74"/>
one author<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">M. Brisson.</NOTE> says they are yellow. Some of these variations, we must presume, depend on the age of the bird; but one circumstance has been noticed in adult specimens that deserves particular notice, the vent and thighs, which are generally ferruginous or rufous, are sometimes white. Mr. Latham, speaking of this variation, says he has a specimen, in which the thighs are dusky white, longitudinally marked with brown; and the vent of a plain white: one of our specimens also precisely agrees with this account.</P>
<P>The length of the male bird is twelve inches, breadth two feet and three inches, weight seven ounces: the female is larger.</P>

<P>The Stone-Chat is a constant inhabitant of this country. In Sum∣mer it frequents heaths and commons: in Winter it retires to the marshes, being the only places in which its favourite food, Insects, is found in abundance.</P>
<P>The length of this bird is four inches and three quarters. The head of the female is ferruginous colour spotted with black; that of the male is entirely black: they differ very little in other respects, except that the colours of the former are more obscure than in the other sex.</P>
<P>Most authors agree that this is a noisy and restless creature, inces∣santly flying from bush to bush, and always carefully concealing the place where its nest is deposited; never alighting on the same spot, but creeping to it on the ground in an artful manner. The nest is placed at the bottom of some bush, or under a stone, and usually con∣tains five or six eggs, of a pale greenish colour with marks of rufous.</P>
<P><PB REF="78"/>The trivial English name of this bird has been accounted for by Mr. Latham in a very curious manner; he says, he cannot find it remarked any where for its having any song. <HI>Buffon</HI> compares its note to the word <HI>ouistrata</HI> frequently repeated; but he has ever thought it exactly imitated the clicking of two stones together, one being held in each hand. If others, says he, have thought the same, it will easily account for the reason of its being called the <HI>Stone-Chatter.</HI></P>

<P>Mr. Latham has given this species a place in his list of the Birds of Great Britain; and we cannot surely incur disapprobation by follow∣ing his example. If the authority of Mr. Latham is unsupported by the opinion of Mr. Pennant, we must recollect that the Zoology of the latter author appeared many years before the <HI>Synopsis</HI> of Mr. Latham; and probably the species was not so generally diffused and domesticated in this country before the British Zoology was published, as since that period. It is impossible that we can account otherwise for what reason he excluded it, since he has given the <HI>Peacock, Phea∣sant, Guinea Hen,</HI> and other domesticated Birds of foreign extraction, which certainly had no better claim to his attention, in that work, than the beautiful Bird before us.</P>
<P>This species is a native of Africa, particularly of the Cape of Good Hope: from the latter place vast numbers have been brought to this country; and the climate favouring their increase, the kind is not uncommon in many parts of the kingdom. It is rather an or∣namental than useful species, and is generally kept in Gentlemen's ponds for pleasure.</P>
<P>Albin published a figure and description of this Bird from a speci∣men reared in this country sixty years ago: he says it fed on grass and corn like other Geese, and thus concludes his observations on the two sexes, "The difference between the cock and hen could not be distinguished neither by the colours or shape, but only by the cock's running to the hen with open wings, clasping or embracing her round with them. I could not find any other name for them from the Poulterers but that of <HI>Ganser.</HI> This bird comes nearest to Mr. <HI>Willoughby's Gambo Goose,</HI> the span in the wings excepted, page 360. tab. 71."—<HI>Vide Albin. vol. ii. p.</HI> 84.</P>

<P>Mr. Pennant, and other writers on the Zoology of this country, supposed the Merlin never bred here, till Dr. Heysham met with two nests in <HI>Cumberland:</HI> they were placed on the ground like that of the Ringtail; and in each were four young. The egg, formerly in the Portland Museum, was of an uniform purplish brown colour, round∣ish, and one inch and a quarter in length. The Merlin appears in England when the Hobby disappears, which happens in October.</P>
<P>This species, like the Hobby, seems to vary exceedingly in colour in different specimens; in some the back and wings are bluish ash-colour<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A specimen in the Leverian Museum answers to this description.</NOTE>, in others ferruginous: the bars of clay-colour and dusky on the tail, are from thirteen to fifteen in most birds; but Mr. Pennant says, one he examined had only eight; our specimen has twelve bars across.</P>
<P>The length of the Merlin is twelve inches: though small, it was formerly trained for hawking, particularly for taking partridges, which some authors say, it could kill by a single stroke on the neck. The Merlin flies low, frequents the sides of roads, and skims from one part to another in search of prey. It is described as a bird wanting neither cunning nor spirit. It is at this time very scarce in England, and seems to be uncommon in every part of Europe.</P>

<P>The beautiful combination of vivid glosses with which the plumage of this common bird is enriched, has been so little attended to in paintings of it, that we are afraid we shall be accused of flattering its appearance, by a gaudy introduction of unnatural tints in the annexed figure: to avoid such imputation we have strictly observed, and ac∣curately expressed the colours from a specimen, in our collection, that had been taken in a state of nature. We are aware that the colours will vary in different specimens of every species, but by cor∣rectly representing one that is perfect, it will convey a better idea of the bird than any of the mutilated creatures kept in cages for amusement.</P>
<P>The tail of the Magpie is particularly remarkable: its colours are more splendid than any other part of the bird: its form is like a wedge; the two middle feathers eleven inches long, the rest decrease gradually, the outermost being only five inches and an half. The principal colour produced by reflection on the black part of the body is fine blue, or purple; the first tint is very vivid on the wings. The
<PB REF="88"/>
finest green is the predominant colour of the tail, which changes in the folds to reddish yellow, with a gilded hue, fine brown, blue, purple, and shades of glossy black throughout. These colours cannot be seen at a distance, because they are produced only by the light falling in a particular direction, and all the bright glosses assimilate with the blacker hues when the bird is removed far from the eye of the spectator.</P>
<P>It would be tedious to enlarge on the pecular habits of a bird, that is familiar to every rustic inhabitant in the kingdom. In all its actions it discovers a degree of instinct superior to most birds. In many respects it resembles the crow; like that creature, it feeds in∣discriminately on every kind of food, Insects, grain, small birds, or their eggs, carrion, and even young poultry. Sometimes it procures its food by stratagem, at others by annoying larger animals when it has no danger to apprehend from them. It is often seen perched on the back of a Sheep or a Cow, picking off the Insects that infest them. In this respect we allow them to be useful; but if they re∣lieve the poor animals from their smaller enemies, they subject them to their own uncontroulable insolence, and sometimes pick out the eyes of animals that attempt to resist them. In a domestic state it is often taught to repeat words, or sentences. It does not imitate the human voice with the same facility and propriety as the parrot, but sufficiently distinct to be understood.</P>
<P>Its great share of instinct is clearly demonstrated by the situation and manner in which the nest is built: it is placed conspicuously on the top of some tree, or in a hawthorn bush, but is always fenced below by brambles and other thick bushes, that make it difficult of access. The nest is composed of thorny twigs well interwoven, and has the
<PB REF="89"/>
thorns sticking outwards: it is lined with wool, feathers and roots, and is plaistered within with fine mud. It is defended above by a thorny covering, and has an entrance just large enough to admit the bird. The Magpie lays six or seven eggs of a greenish colour, spotted with black.</P>

<P>Five species of this tribe of birds are natives of this country, if we include the Brown Tern mentioned by Mr. Latham as a doubtful kind, and not noticed by Mr. Pennant.

<P>The Black Cock, like the Cock of the Wood, is seldom found, except in northern countries; in those near the south, which it sometimes inhabits, it prefers the coldest situations amongst woods and mountains: it feeds on the birch trees and mountain fruits. In Russia and Siberia, they are very abundant, as they were formerly in Scotland, Wales, and the north of England; at present they are much diminished in this country, and, perhaps, may become as scarce as the Cock of the Wood is at present, the flesh being much esteemed, and therefore eagerly sought for.</P>
<P>It seems to partake greatly of the habits of the Cock of the Wood; it frequents the same situations, and subsists on the same kind of food. It never pairs with the females; but, in the spring, the male ascends some eminence, crows, and claps his wings, and the females, attentive to his note, resort to the spot.</P>
<P><PB REF="97"/>The female is much smaller than the male. Its length is eighteen inches, weight two pounds; the colours are red, black, and dusky white, which are disposed in alternate bars and spots, in different directions. The most remarkable part of the male bird is the tail, which consists of sixteen feathers; the exterior ones curve very much outwards, and give it a forked appearance; but when the tail is expanded, it resembles a large fan. Length of the male is twenty-one inches.</P>
<P>The female lay six or eight eggs, of a yellowish colour, speckled with ferruginous, and blotched at the small end with the same colour. The young males leave the female parent in the beginning of winter, and keep in flocks, of six or eight, till spring. They are very quarrelsome, and fight like game-cocks.</P>

<P>Amongst the number of curious and elegant species that have been extirpated in this country, the English Naturalist will most regret the loss of this bird. It was formerly very common, and its flesh much admired. It formed a part of many of the old English feasts; and, amongst others, that recorded by Leland, which was given by George Nevell, archbishop of York, in the reign of Edward the Fourth, alone included <HI>"one thousand Egrittes."</HI> At this time it is consi∣dered such a rarity, that Mr. Pennant observes, in his Appendix to the British Zoology, "We once received out of <HI>Anglesea</HI> the feathers of a bird shot there, which we suspect to be the Egret; this is the only instance, perhaps, of its being found in our country." The same author adds, in another part, "We have never met with this bird, or the Crane, in England, but formed our descriptions from specimens in the elegant cabinet of Dr. Mauduit, in Paris."</P>
<P>In some foreign countries it is still very common: is found in several parts of Europe and Asia: it is also said to be found in Africa, and on the American continent.</P>
<P>The weight of this bird is one pound, the length about eleven inches; the appendage of loose feathers, which is situated on the back, and hang over the rump, were anciently used to decorate caps, or head pieces; and hence the ornament to a cap, in later times, was called an aigrette.</P>

<P>The Imber Diver inhabits the seas about the Orkney and Ferroe Islands, and never visits the southern parts of Great Britain, except in severe winters. Living chiefly at sea, it is taken with much dif∣ficulty. If pursued when swimming, it dives under the water, and does not appear again till it is at a considerable distance from its pursuers. It is often caught under water by a hook, baited with small fish. Willoughby says, they are sometimes taken in this manner sixty feet under water.</P>
<P>Being rarely seen on land, it has been believed that it never quitted the water, and that it hatched its young in a hole formed by nature under the wing. Naturalists have discovered its nest among <HI>reeds</HI> and <HI>flags</HI> in the water, where it is kept continually wet, as in some of the Grebe genus.</P>
<P>This species is larger than the common goose: the length is about twenty-five inches. The male is said to be distinguished by a few brown specks on the side of the neck, and by having the colours throughout more defined than in the female: some authors have, however, considered the supposed females as birds not in an adult state.</P>

<P>The Kingsfisher is seven inches in length; its weight is one ounce and a quarter. It is almost needless to remark, that this bird is esteemed the most beautiful of the feathered race that inhabits the south of Europe. In its form it is rather inelegant; but its colours are fine throughout: the azure of its back is exceedingly bright; and when the creature is hovering in the air, in a fine day, it appears resplendent in the highest degree.</P>
<P>The absurd fictions that poets, in the vigour of their imagi∣nation, have formed concerning this bird, have particularly in∣clined naturalists to examine its manners of life with attention. The poets placed it in a floating nest, during the time of incubation, and endowed it with power to calm the adverse winds and seas. <HI>Aristotle</HI> and <HI>Pliny</HI> tell us, that this bird is most common in the seas of Sicily: that it sat only a few days, and those in the depth of
<PB REF="107"/>
winter, and during that period the mariner might fail in full secu∣rity, for which reason they were styled <HI>Halcyon days</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pennant.</NOTE>. Among the moderns, its flesh has been thought unperishable, and capable of preserving woollen and other vestments from decay; and it has also been supposed to turn its breast to the north when hung up dead.</P>
<P>Specimens of this bird are brought from almost every part of the world: in England it is not uncommon: it frequents the sides of running streams, and takes its prey, which consists entirely of fish, by darting on it in the water. It makes no nest, but lays seven or more, beautiful transparent white eggs, in a large hole in the bank of a river or stream.</P>

<HEAD>ADDRESS.</HEAD>
<P>IMPELLED by grateful sentiments, the Author cannot conclude the Fourth Volume of this Work without expressing his sincere acknowledgments to the Public for the favourable manner in which it has been received. From the encourage∣ment which has attended it in the course of publication, he presumes that the expectations of the Subscribers have not been disappointed in any part of it; and it is particularly pleasing to find, the concluding numbers have given the utmost satisfaction.</P>
<P>The Author would have been happy if he could have promised, at the commencement of this Work, to present a complete History of British Ornithology; but, being aware of the difficulty of procuring some of the rare <HI>Aborigines</HI> of the Country, and fearful of displeasing many Subscribers, by introducing others that are familiar to every one, he con∣ceived it would be most advisable to select only those which were particularly interesting to the English Naturalist, or Country Gentleman; these, including all the Birds formerly known in Great Britain, together with those rare migratory Species that are sometimes found even in the interior of the Country.</P>
<P>As far as the prescribed limits of the Work would admit, the Author hopes he has fulfilled this promise to the Public. If he has excluded some fine Birds, such as the Goldfinch, the Bullfinch, the Pheasant and its varieties, with others no less beautiful, it was to reserve a place for some that were scarcely known to exist in the Country. The <HI>Rose-coloured Ouzel,
<PB REF="116"/>
Roller, Little Bittern,</HI> and <HI>Golden Oriole,</HI> are of this descrip∣tion; and to these we may add the <HI>Egret, Cock of the Wood, Black Cock, Black Woodpecker,</HI> and <HI>Waxen Chatterer.</HI> The <HI>Wood Chat,</HI> which English authors have figured from mere descriptions, sufficiently mark the attention of the Author to render this Work no less respectable than useful. The <HI>Red-necked Grebe, Northern Diver, Water Ouzel, Dartford War∣bler, Dusky Lark, Long-legged Plover,</HI> with many others, equally rare and interesting, having been procured purposely for this Work, evidently prove, that no expence has been spared to make it complete.</P>
<P>Since the one hundred Plates have been engraved, some rare Birds have come into the Author's possession; but rather than incur the imputation of trespassing on the public favour, he declined adding them to the Work, until it appeared to be the wishes of the Subscribers to have a Sup∣plement: that being to be added, at their request, the Public may be persuaded that every exertion will be made to render it worthy of their approbation.</P>
<P>The distinguished manner in which Works of Natural History are encouraged at this period, leads us to a few re∣flections, which, it is presumed, are not entirely inapplicable to the present Work, and may be some apology for the different publications of that description, which the Author has lately submitted to the Public.</P>
<P>It is a noble sentiment of the British Nation, to be no less respected for their learning than admired for their valour, by other nations; yet it is a truth which national pride dare not conceal, that several sciences, and those especially of Natural History, have been more successfully cultivated
<PB REF="117"/>
by our continental neighbours than by ourselves. The study of those sciences unfold too many advantages to civilized society to be entirely overlooked in any country; and some of its branches have ever found admirers in courts, and patrons in princes; but it is not in every country that a number of less exalted individuals are disposed to afford them that encouragement, which alone can evince the general taste of a nation.</P>
<P>The devastations of war have, indeed, materially checked many learned enquiries in other countries, whilst the English nation, by its fostering protection, have contributed much to their improvement. This may ultimately excite a laudable emulation in this country, to equal, or excel others, in the knowledge of those sciences; for, surely, it is not to our credit, that learned foreigners are well acquainted with the natural productions even of our country, while we remain ignorant of them.</P>
<P>The Author of this Work had formerly conceived, that an Epitome at least of the Natural History of Great Britain, would be acceptable to many; and this is now in forwardness to completion. Botany, the most useful and pleasing branch, has been, in part, illustrated already, in a manner that re∣flects honour on its Authors. The mineral, fossil, and ma∣rine productions, are, probably, less generally known. The Insects and Birds, the Author has endeavoured to illustrate, and he hopes his exertions have not been unsuccessful.</P>
<P>The inimitable beauty and variety, both of structure and colours, which distinguish the natural productions of warmer regions, will always obtrude on the attention of European Naturalists, and agreeably diversify a study, that without
<PB REF="118"/>
such auxiliary aid, might seem less interesting: yet we may observe, that, to become well acquainted with exotic Natural History, it is necessary to examine that of Europe. In England, like other northern countries, Nature assumes a grave aspect, but yet presents an unbounded source of amusement and information to the intelligent mind; and must merit the inquiries of learned men, who are inclined to promote knowledge, or feel an interest in the credit of the country.</P>
<P>Whoever has devoted much leisure to the study of Natural History, will be surprized at the inconsiderable number of learned works on that subject that are in the English lan∣guage; and of those it may be said, as Edwards in 1760 <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Essays on Natural History.</NOTE> remarks, that what we have are mostly translations from other languages. This is not, however, the only blame; the artists of our country have been condemned for pirating their figures from the works of foreign authors; and it must be owned, this has been too frequently practised. Since Edwards wrote his book, Botany and Ornithology have undergone great improvements; and the latter in particular, by the writings of Pennant; but more especially by Latham, who having added the information of preceding authors to a correct description of each Bird, seemed to leave little wanting of a complete British Ornithology, but a series of accurately coloured Figures of the different Species. To supply this deficiency in particular, has been the aim of the Author of this Work; and he trusts the Selection of rare Species that he has included in it, will facilitate the study of that important and amusing branch of Natural History.</P>
