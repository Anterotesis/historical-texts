<HEAD>TO THE MOST NOBLE THE <HI>MARQUIS OF SALISBURY.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>To neglect any proper opportunity of testifying my devotion to
your Lordship, would be unjust, unworthy, and ungrateful; there∣fore, I
only comply with the most manifest pro∣priety in humbly soliciting your
protection to this work.</P>
<P>Yet, my Lord, though the propriety is <PB N="ii" REF="4"/>
strong, though the task is indispensible, though the subject warmly
gratifies my best pride, yet never was effort so uncommonly
difficult.—Great men have patronized public characters, and the
encouragement of genius has been, in many instances, the most brilliant
distinction of English nobility: but there is no example of such an act
of beneficence as that which your Lordship has extended towards me. No
bene∣factor ever had the power to confer a favour of equal magnitude, nor were
those favours that have been conferred given from any such noble motive, or
independent principle.</P>
<P>It was reserved for your Lordship to dig∣nify patronage, by
blending solicitous condes∣cension with spontaneous liberality.</P>
<P>If then men of great and celebrated talents have found their
thanks inadequate to inferior favours, in attempting to describe the true 
<PB N="iii" REF="5"/> colour of my acknowledgments, how greatly must I fail,
who can express so little, and who have been honoured so much.</P>
<P>My sanctuary is in my mind. No man's feelings can be more alive
than mine are, nor was there ever an occasion on which they were so
sensibly or so worthily roused. I humbly hope, therefore, your
Lordship will, in your goodness, take my thanks upon trust, and give me
credit for that gratitude which glows in my heart, but which no language can
convey to my pen.</P>
<P>With the truest zeal, and most perfect devotion,</P>

<PB REF="6"/>
<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THERE cannot be any thing 10 fallacious as the cavils of those
authors who complain of being unjustly treated by the public. The judgment of
the public, like those laws to which they owe their existence, as a
respected and a happy people—spight of the factious few, whose
impotent clamour serves, as its shadow, to display the light of
reason—never fails to decide firmly, yet indulgently; and nothing can
more completely confirm character and security, than the dispassionate
determination of the one, and the unbiassed decision of the other.</P>
<P>But, though the judgment of the public and the laws of the land
contain in themselves all we know of reason and equity, yet nothing can be
so difficult as to make a fair appeal to either. The sons of chi∣cane, in
both, so clog up the course, and so poison the air, that the career is
fatiguing and dangerous; <PB N="ii" REF="7"/> and thus many, with fair
pretensions, turn back, their pursuits and purposes unaccomplished, and
ra∣ther resign the honours of the race, than strive to reach a delusive
goal, to obtain an unavailing vic∣tory.</P>
<P>Perhaps the painter, who had been ruined by going to law, without
bringing any thing to issue, had these ideas in his mind when he drew a
picture of justice, supported by hunger and thirst.</P>
<P>But I shall leave those laws which the prudence of our
forefathers has established for the security of property—which are,
in this country, a monument of sober reflection, sound wisdom, and
solid judg∣ment; which are, at this moment, dispensed by men of brilliant
talents, correct information, and invincible integrity, and which are only
inconve∣nient because they are abused, inefficient because their
essence is perverted, and oppressive because they are held out as
snares for the good and the wor∣thy, by the wicked and the
worthless—and speak of those other laws which civilization has
established <PB N="iii" REF="8"/> for the security of fame, and which,
being of a wider extent, and without so decided a criterion, are productive
of much more sportive mischief than the others; both because the
scribbling pettifoggers have warmer imaginations than the legal ones, and
because their nefarious freaks, though full as ras∣cally, may be
exercised with impunity.</P>
<P>According to this, illicit lawyers—for I really ought to
make this distinction—so they possess a plentiful stock of
cunning and craft, need not be overburdened with intellects; but this is not
the case with the other class. Illicit writers cannot combat opinions
without some stock of general in∣formation; their competitors being men of
abili∣ties: and thus it happens, that as you may call a lawyer a dunce and
welcome, so you do not call him a rogue, so you may call a scribbler a
rogue and welcome, so you do not call him a dunce: which is like Foote's
stroke at a society who sometime ago set themselves up as reformers,
under the appellation of The Christian Club.</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="9"/> Having talked of hanging, and being told that
such an insinuation would give offence, for that a brother of one of the
members had been hanged, he changes his ground, and talks of damning.— 
<Q REND="inline">'That is right,' says the other, 'damn as much
as you please; for though the Christian club may have some fears of the
gallows, they do not value damnation of a brass farthing!'</Q></P>
<P>The truth of this distinction which I have made will, I think,
be pretty clearly established, by a consideration that the traffic of the
lawyers depends on certain things called goods, chattles, houses,
hereditaments—in short any thing that can be con∣veyed—whereas
the scribblers cannot always convey the object of their traffic, even in
idea. A lam∣poon is not attachable; or, if it were, it would be of no value.
There is nothing tangible in a modern Pindaric ode; or, if there were, as
Shakespeare has it, 
<Q REND="inline">'Those that touch pitch will be defiled.'</Q>
Nor can poor Priscian bring his action of battery, though we see his head
broken every day.</P>
<P><PB N="v" REF="10"/> Thus, while they steer clear of hitting the
man, they may discharge whole vollies of their pointless arrows at the
writer with safety. He has no objection to their picking up their crumbs at
his expence. The sun nurtures myriads of insects, that at once inhale
poison and preservation from his genial influence.</P>
<P>As I certainly allude to the abuse with which, in my life, I
have been so foully bespattered, it should seem as if I had drawn this
conclusion with a view to announce myself a man of genius. Were I so
weak, I should be in a lamentable error indeed. For an author, with the
smallest pretensions to fame, I ought by this time to have been abused
ten times more than I have; unless indeed I rate the quality of the abuse
in addition to the quantity, and so, by throwing one lump of invidious
rascality into the scale, make it preponderate in my fa∣vour.</P>
<P>I am afraid however I am not so lucky; for, in this case, I
must take in the idea that the slander <PB N="vi" REF="11"/> of a rogue is a
compliment to an honest man: and I have already said, that every thing
beyond literary defamation is here out of the question. I have therefore
nothing left for it but a comparative view of that abuse which has been
levelled at others and myself, and, upon that enumeration, I shall be
driven to estimate my own labours at that humble rate which the public will
always give its due praise, but which aspires at nothing more.</P>
<P>To begin with the ancients. Has any writer sustained more rank
and foul abuse than Homer? who, after all, is so justly styled the
father of poetry: and if they began with the father, no wonder they have so
completely gone through all the family.—It has been said that the
muses themselves set him up a rival in Hesiod, whom they invited to
reside with them on Mount Helicon, and, that they might initiate him into all
their mysteries, actually took him into their service, and endowed him with
their own celestial genius. Tutored thus by his heavenly
instructresses, he is said to have won a tripod from Homer at a
poetical controversy at Chalcis; but <PB N="vii" REF="12"/> Alexander laughs
at this business, construing it into a compliment to Homer, and saying
that Hesiod might well win a prize from Homer, when not kings, but peasants
were the judges.</P>
<P>When you come to Virgil, these candid re∣porters allow nothing
more than that he was the translator and imitator of Homer; to prove which,
they instance his sending Aeneas to hell, in positive imitation of the
Odyssey, the conversation of the gods, the games, the ships, and many
other things. But what sort of an imitator of Homer must he have been if it
be true, as Le Mercier informs us, that Homer wrote neither the Iliad nor the
Odyssey!—but that they were compiled from the works of all the
eminent writers of that time; impressing very strongly an idea that Homer
was merely a ballad singer, and that he invented nothing, but only
pro∣mulgated the Grub-street doctrine of Greece.</P>
<P>It is said also that Virgil imitated Hesiod in his georgics,
and Theocritus in his pastorals. Ter∣rence too is said to have been no more
than the <PB N="viii" REF="13"/> translator of Plautus, Livy the imitator of
Hero∣dotus, and Sallust of Thucidides, who had before been imitated in his
writings—which, after all, were obscure—by Zenephon, and in his
orations by Demosthenes. Horace, they report, stole his art of poetry from
Aristotle's rhetoric; and, as to Aristotle himself, some have gone so
far as to ques∣tion whether we have any thing genuine of his at all, and they
offer the following circumstance as a notable proof of this vague and
strange opinion.</P>
<P>Theophrastus received, as a legacy, the writ∣ings of
Aristotle. The heirs of Theophrastus bu∣ried them in the ground, at
Scepsis, a town of Troas, to hide them from King Pergamus. Here they lay
concealed a hundred and sixty years, and were, at the end of that time,
sold to one Appelli∣con, a rich citizen of Athens. They fell afterwards into
the hands of Sylla; after that they were pos∣sessed by Tyrannian, a
grammarian; and next they became the property of Andronicus, of Rhodes, who
first made them public about two hundred and fifty years after the death of
Aristotle.</P>
<P><PB N="ix" REF="14"/> Thus, we have a Virgil who imitated a Homer,
who never was a writer!—and we have a Horace who stole from the works
of an Aristotle, which works it is insinuated are spurious! But neither
is Zoilus himself, of Philadelphus, nor Le Mercier, the Zoilus of France, to
be put in the smallest com∣petition with Father Ardouine, who, determined
to put the matter out of doubt, roundly asserts, upon his own single
authority, that Homer, Virgil, and Horace were all forged by monks, in the
twelfth century!! Perhaps it was upon some occasion like this that Pascal
said it was easier to find monks than reasons.</P>
<P>Thus go on these Aristarchuses in criticism. The defenders
of Virgil, assuming great candour, tell us that they subscribe to
those charges brought against him, above mentioned, but that he cer∣tainly
excelled Hesiod. Justice however obliges them to confess that he fell
short of Theocritus in the same proportion as the Latin is inferior to the
Greek. They confess too that he stole from Lu∣cretius; but this, they add,
was a proof of his es∣teem <PB N="x" REF="15"/> for him. They then candidly
hint that it was little better than receiving stolen goods, for that
Lucretius himself is suspected of having taken some of his works from
Empedocles and others, and yet, in the same breath, they say that Lucretius
ranks before all other Latin authors. They defend Vir∣gil from a charge that
Lucan was a greater poet, combating the opinions of Heinsius, Corneille,
Heron, and Fielding, who all give the palm to Lu∣can; but, to make this defence
as left-handed as possible, they allow that the Pharsalia is more
com∣plete than the Aeneid, because there is a fault in the chronology; which
anacronism, however, to gloss over, they insist that Virgil intended it
as a beauty, and then follow up this cold compliment by saying that Lucan,
though an original, was an original of no value. The deduction therefore is,
that it is doubtful whether Virgil was not a worse poet than Lucan, who,
after all, has no great merit himself. But a modern critic has gone a great
deal beyond this; asserting, that though the whole re∣putation of Virgil
stands upon three specimens of imitation, though he has no invention, no
origina∣lity, <PB N="xi" REF="16"/> no creation, yet he deserves all his
fame:—and how does he make this out? Why, truly, by attributing this fame
to his style, which he calls the 
<Q REND="inline">'pickle that has preserved his mummy from
cor∣ruption.'</Q></P>
<P>Were I to advert to the long catalogue of op∣posite opinions
which will very easily occur to any man of reading, who has a faithful and
retentive memory, it would be an intrusion on the patience of every
intelligent reader. I have instanced abun∣dantly enough to prove that
cavillers find it difficult to convince; that Envy beholds pigmy
imperfec∣tions, and neglects giant beauties; and that fools, in search of
defects and contradictions, deprive themselves of that pleasure and
improvement with which heaven permits men of superior talents to adorn the
world.</P>
<P>It is with me a matter of infinite concern, that if candour be the
criterion of genius, the ancients possessed more genius than the
moderns. When Euripides died, Sophocles went into mourning; 
<PB N="xii" REF="17"/> and yet, to prove that Sophocles was fond of ap∣plause,
he died with joy at the success of one of his own tragedies. What can be
more noble than the declaration of Theodore Gaza, that if all the works then
extant were to be thrown into the sea, the last that would merit such a
fate would be the works of Plutarch! Or the forbearance of Zenophon, who might
have had the writings of Thucidides attributed to him, but he disdained
it!</P>
<P>If the cotemporaries of Terence acknowledge that he has imitated
Plautus, they never fail to add that it was making gold out of dross. By one
it was said, that the very prostitutes of Terence speak with more
modesty than the honest women of Plau∣tus. Cicero, speaking of the purity
of Terence, calls him the regulator of the Latin tongue. Alex∣ander, when he
sacked Thebes, spared the house and posterity of Pindar. Plato was
called the di∣vine. Zenophon, from his sweetness and beauty, is called the
bee, and the attic muse. His works are said to have inspired Scipio, the
African, and <PB N="xiii" REF="18"/> Lucullus, in like manner as those of
Homer fired the mind of Alexander.</P>
<P>When do we hear, in these times, such warmth and candour as
that of Appolonius Molus? who, on hearing Cicero harrangue, exclaimed— 
<Q REND="inline">'Poor Greece! Now thou art utterly
undone!—The Romans had before conquered thee in arms: now they have
conquered thee in eloquence!'</Q></P>
<P>These few instances, among many that occur to me, prove that
the ancients possessed every merit that has been attributed to them,
and shew that the greatest effort of the human mind is to rise
su∣perior to envy.</P>
<P>The influence of this fiend, however, lay only dormant till the
inestimable works of these great men were universally diffused. The
moment that opportunity occurred, she shook off her torpor, awoke, walked
abroad, and looked so terrible, that modest reason sighed, blushed,
and retired.</P>
<P><PB N="xiv" REF="19"/> To be plain. It is remarkable that the more
modern we get, the more the number of cavillers increases; and, really, as
cavilling is a very un∣gracious thing, this is lucky for them; both be∣cause
the task becomes every day more and more difficult, and because the dunces
become every day more and more stupid. Thus the labour, by being given into
so many hands, is infinitely less tre∣mendous.</P>
<P>The quantum of abuse must be always the same, and how hard
it is to fall to the lot of one man, wholly to employ himself in searching
out the faults of his neighbour, when, by an honest appro∣priation of his
time, he might manifest some per∣fection of his own. This feat of
hardihood, how∣ever, we see Milbourn, almost single-handed, at∣tempt
against Dryden, though the portion of abuse is as great, and the quality as
malevolent, as all that vast cargo of Grub-street filth with which Pope was
bespattered, by all the heroes immortalized in the Dunciad; and, if we want a
climax, we have no∣thing to do but look at that flock of critical crows 
<PB N="xv" REF="20"/> who, even yet, have not left off gorging on the li∣terary
carcase of Doctor Johnson.</P>
<P>But, if I were to go into that large field of ob∣servation which
it would be necessary to traverse to get at the divers schisms that
have, at times, dis∣tracted the state of literature, I should make it the
field of battle between the moderns and the ancients. In France I should
set Corneille and Racine against Sophocles and Euripides; Malherbe
against Pin∣dar; Moliere against Menander and Aristophanes, nay Plautus
and Terence. The Countess De la Suse and Madame Dacier would pull caps with
Sapho. In Italy, Petrarch and Guarini would at∣tack Ovid and Tibullus;
Tasso would menace to their teeth Homer and Virgil; Camoes, Lopez de Vega,
Calderone, and Cervantes, would single out their respective antagonists,
for the honour of Spain and Portugal; and I should involve literature in that
chaos of prejudices and opinions, from which men of the best learning find it
so extremely diffi∣cult to separate its constituent parts.</P>
<P><PB N="xvi" REF="21"/> Did I extend the scene to England,
instead of the preface to a work, I must necessarily make this a work
of itself. So many, so extraordinary, so vague, so diversified have
been the real or affected opinions in this country, as to what constitutes
the essence of literary perfection, that you have only to transmute them,
as you ring changes upon bells, and every English writer, at different times,
has, and has not, possessed it.</P>
<P>I shall therefore, by way of corroborating my assertion,
that no man is entitled to any large por∣tion of literary fame till he has been
handsomely abused, only instance some of that prodigious load of foul
and slanderous filth which—as good some∣times grows out of
evil—procured the world those two monuments of genius and justice,
Mac Flecnoe, and the Dunciad; and I the more readily do this, to shew that
one specimen is as good as a thousand: because, were I to produce a
thousand, nothing could be said in them but what is already said here;
nay, nor even in one of these that is not said in the other.</P>
<P><PB N="xvii" REF="22"/> Milbourn, as I before mentioned, is the
au∣thor of nearly all the calumny against Dryden.—Pope's calumniators
are Dennis, Theobald, Old∣mixon, and a variety of others, who, one should
think, were more than adequate to the task; for they had nothing to do but
copy what had been written before. Dryden, upon this single, and Pope, upon
this complicate authority, are every thing that can be said of the worst
men and the worst writers.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">"Dryden is a mere renegado from monarchy, poetry,
and good sense!"</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Pope is an open enemy to his country and the
commonwealth of learning!'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">"Dryden is a true republican, son of a
mo∣narchical church, and a republican atheist!"</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Pope is both a roman-catholic whig, and a
pro∣testant tory!'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">"Dryden has notoriously traduced the king, the
queen, the lords, the gentlemen, and libelled <PB N="xviii" REF="23"/> the whole
nation and its representatives!"—</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Pope has abused the persons of the king, the
queen, both houses of parliament, the privy council, the bench of bishops,
the established church, and the ministry!'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">"Dryden looks upon God's gospel as a foolish
fable, like the pope, to whom he is a pitiful pur∣veyor. His very
christianity may be questioned. He ought to expect more severity than
other men, as he is more unmerciful in his reflections on others. With as good
a right as his holiness, he sets up for poetical infallibility."</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Pope is a popish rhymester, bred up with a
contempt of the sacred writings. His religion al∣lows him to destroy
heretics, not only with his pen, but with fire and sword; and such were all
those unhappy wits whom he sacrificed to his ac∣cursed popish
principles. It deserved vengeance to suggest that Mr. Pope has less
infallibility than his namesake at Rome.'</Q></P>
<P><PB N="xix" REF="24"/> 
<Q REND="inline">"Dryden's libel," meaning Mac Flecknoe, "is all
bad matter: beautiful (which is all that can be said of it) with good metre.
Mr. Dryden's genius did not appear in any thing more than his versification,
and whether he is to be ennobled for that only is a question."</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Pope's smooth numbers, in the Dunciad, are all
that recommend it; nor has it any other me∣rit. It must be owned he has got a
notable knack of rhyming and writing smooth verse.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">"Dryden's Virgil is so called to shew it is
not that Virgil so admired in the Augustan age, but a Virgil of another
stamp: a silly, impertinent, nonsensical writer. None but a Bavius, a
Mae∣vius, or a Bathyllus, carped at Virgil, and none but such unthinking
vermine admire his trans∣lator."</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Pope's Homer does not talk like Homer, but like
Pope, and he who translated him one would swear had a hill in Tiperary for
his Par∣nassus, <PB N="xx" REF="25"/> and a puddle in some bog for his
Hypo∣crene. He has no admirers among those who can distinguish,
discern, and judge.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">"Dryden deserves to be whipt for his igno∣rance
of Greek."</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Pope undertook to translate Homer, from the
Greek, of which he knows not one word, into English, of which he
understands as lit∣tle.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">"Dryden imposed upon his subscribers, by
holding out a partially and unseasonably cele∣brated name; which
imposition extended even to the picking of their pockets."</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Pope's subscribers have been deceived in
their expectations, in proportion as he has drained their pockets.'</Q></P>
<P>The epithets which have been bestowed on these great men are
still more curious. Milbourn <PB N="xxi" REF="26"/> thus calls Dryden an ape. 
<Q REND="inline">"A crafty ape, dressed in a gaudy gown. Whips
put into an ape's paw, to play pranks with. None but apish and papish brats
will heed him."</Q></P>
<P>Dennis is just as kind to Pope. 
<Q REND="inline">'Let us take,' says he, 'the initial letter of
his christian name, and the initial and final letters of his surname, viz.
A P E, and they give you the same idea of an ape as his face.'</Q></P>
<P>Dryden, according to Milbourn, is also an ass. 
<Q REND="inline">"A camel," says he, "will take upon him no more
burden than is sufficient for his strength; but there is another beast
that crouches under all."</Q></P>
<P>Pope is ingeniously paid the same compliment, by Dennis. 
<Q REND="inline">'It is my duty,' says he, 'to pull off the
lion's skin from this little ass.'</Q></P>
<P>Dryden is, after this, a frog. 
<Q REND="inline">'Poet Squab,' says Milbourn, "endued with Poet
Maroe's spirit: <PB N="xxii" REF="27"/> an ugly croaking kind of vermine,
which would swell to the bulk of an ox."</Q></P>
<P>Dennis, imitating his preceptor, says almost the same thing
of Pope. 
<Q REND="inline">'A squab, short gentle∣man: a little creature,
that, like the frog in the fable, swells, and is angry that it is not allowed
to be as big as an ox.'</Q></P>
<P>Dryden is, after this, and so is Pope, a knave, a coward, a
fool, and a thing; which indeed—if a pun may be pardoned—seems
the only thing left for them to say.</P>
<P>If then ignorance, imposition, cowardice kna∣very, profligacy,
irreligion, and treason are requisite attributes to establish the
same of Dryden and Pope, 
<Q REND="inline">"why what a vile and peasant slave am I!"</Q>
My calumniators have gone but a very little way indeed towards ascertaining
my merit by this criterion. I beg therefore they will bestir themselves;
and as, in this novel, I have given them new opportunity—especially as
they may find in it a mirror that will <PB N="xxiii" REF="28"/> reflect some
of their own faces—I assure them they cannot afford me a more
sensible pleasure than to avail themselves of it, as usual, unawed by
truth, candour, or consistency.</P>
<P>Having indubitably proved that it is my inte∣rest to be
abused, I shall now, for the advantage of those who, though they intend
enmity, confer kind∣ness, shew in what way it may best, or rather most
expediently, be done.</P>
<P>First, I would have them keep no sort of mea∣sures, but
indulge their rancour as much as possible. Let their method be to hold
such trifles as proba∣bility, propriety, and decency in contempt; to use
perpetually epithets which are appropriate to rage, disappointment, and
vexation, to enforce terms that imply candour, ingenuousness and
liberality.—Thus, in proportion as they are bursting with envy, so,
at least in their own opinions, they will conceal it: like the silly bird,
that thrusts its head into a hedge, to hide its body from its pursuers.</P>
<P><PB N="xxiv" REF="29"/> If they would detect nonsense, I would
have them write nonsense themselves; because this will shew
practically what it is. Ignorance of their sub∣ject is a good thing;
because it serves to exercise the ingenuity of the reader. Ill manners is
not a∣miss; for it often bullies the reader into a fancied comprehension of
what in reality is incomprehen∣sible.</P>
<P>I would have all their outworks of criticism fortified with
threats, denunciations, and menaces. I would have these supported by
impudence, arro∣gance, and cruelty. I would have them place about fascines of
hints, insinuations, and conjectures; and when, by a powerful onset of
truth and conviction, they were driven from these, I would have them take
shelter in their strong hold of <HI>ipse dixit;</HI> that anticipater of
argument, that reconciler of absur∣dity, that friend of ignorance, that
vehicle of ma∣levolence, that poisoned arrow, that coiled snake, that
baneful flower, that smiling precipice!</P>
<P><HI>Ipse dixit!—</HI>the skulking retreat of the
shuffler, <PB N="xxv" REF="30"/> the hypocrite, the villain, the traitor, and
the ras∣cal! <HI>Ipse dixit!—</HI>that shall blast the faith of
ho∣nour, that shall fully the purity of virtue, that shall pervert truth,
sanctify mischief, emulate murder, annihilate order, reprobate morality,
dignify sacri∣lege, profane the throne, and defy heaven!</P>
<P>Let them utter <HI>ipse dixits</HI> then like so many fiats,
but never let them presume to argue; lest, de∣tected by ignorance,
forsaken by truth, and ex∣posed to scorn, they betray frontless
impudence and scowling envy, hidden by a filmy veil of candour.</P>
<P>There are some subjects however with which I would not
advise them to tamper. In particular, let them not risk the awkward
predicament in which they would stand if they were hardy enough to cen∣sure
the public for the warm and liberal reception afforded to my labours. Let them
not venture to slander those men of worth and honour who ap∣prove in me, in
opposition to them, a life of regu∣larity, sobriety, and industry: and,
above all, as it is impossible for human invention—not even their
in∣vention—to <PB N="xxvi" REF="31"/> give any other motive to the
honourable and generous support by which I have the happiness to be
distinguished by that nobleman who presides over public amusements,
than unexampled and trans∣cendant benevolence; let them, instead of
attempt∣ing to describe it, scowl, bite their malignant quills, gnash
their teeth, and hang their recreant heads in sullenness and despair.</P>
<P>With these instructions, I think they can hardly miss their
way. If there should be any danger of it—as it would be a pity that
such charitable inten∣tions should reap nothing but shame and
confusion—by way of consummating their noble and manly purpose, let
them boldly assert that I have written none of this book. Let them be so
ungratefully se∣vere as to say it is not I who have given them this
friendly advice, but some outcast from society; and, as novelty in
slander is as catching as in any thing else—having gone every other
length—suppose this time, by way of variety, it were to be attributed
to some murderer. I think, as Mr. Bayes has it, the circumstance would
elevate and surprise. But this, <PB N="xxvii" REF="32"/> after all, I leave
to themselves; for it is impossible I should be an adept in an employ
the motives of which I scorn, and the malignity of which I detest.</P>
<P>If, by officiously pointing out their readiest road, it
should appear to them that I have, by anticipa∣tion, betrayed the cloven
foot, and they should be therefore induced to forego their intentions, from
an apprehension of detection—for assassins are always
cowards—let it be remembered that I shall set it down for a sulky
perverseness; and, even though no single word of abuse shall be
breathed against me, I shall take very comfortably to myself the same
portion of fame as if such advantageous circumstance had really happened,
and set it down, with all the composure in the world, as a large figure to
go to∣wards that aggregate of slander which I have so plainly shewn is
necessary to constitute the fame of a writer, and which, upon that ground
of argu∣ment, I am so ambitious to merit.</P>
<P>Having gone through the painful part of my duty—for there is
nothing so painful as that which <PB N="xxviii" REF="33"/> is unavailing, and
there is nothing so unavailing as giving advice to the incorrigible—a
few words will bring me to the end of this preface. A few very pleasing
words! They are these: that in this, as in every other instance where I
have offered any pro∣duction to the public, having portrayed vice in its
ugliest form and filthiest colours; having hunted craft and art to the
toils; having invited the broad laugh against vain and insuperable folly;
having ex∣cited the admiration, and commended the practice, of virtue and
honour, I fearlessly trust my book to its fortune, safe in the
criticism of the candid, and secure in the indulgence of the liberal; for
the moral I inculcate is the folly of wickedness, and the wis∣dom of
rectitude: a doctrine which shews, that while irritated vice multiplies
deformity, by break∣ing the mirror of nature, it remains entire and un∣fullied
to the eye of virtue, that consciously reflects its own unspotted
loveliness.</P>

COMPRISED IN SEVERAL VOLUMES—YET LESS THAN ANY BOOK IN THIS
HISTORY.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAPTER I.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>SHEWS UPON WHAT GROUNDS THE AUTHOR FOUNDS HIS PRE∣TENSIONS TO
THE READER'S INDULGENCE.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>As it very often happens that readers get half through a work
without knowing its drift—not un∣frequently because the author does not
know it him∣self—I hold it necessary to preclude all
possibility of any such thing in the perusal of this work, by
premising what, according to my conception, ought to be the tendency of
productions similar to this, and what I here mean to inculcate in
particular.</P>
<P>A novel, as the word is now understood and established, is
a general title for any work which <PB N="2" REF="35"/> springs solely from
the imagination, yet so deline∣ates men and manners as to place all its
events within view of probability. It is a kind of mean betwixt history,
which records mere fact, and ro∣mance, which holds out acknowledged
fiction.</P>
<P>As, however, pleasure and instruction are the only end that
any admitted exercise of the imagination can propose, these all labour,
with different materials, to produce the same effect. History not only
teaches mankind to shun vice and imitate virtue, by in∣stancing those
events which are most condusive to so laudable an end, but shews the
propriety of the doctrine it enforces, by authenticating the possibi∣lity
of such conduct.</P>
<P>The novelist, who is the biographer of an ima∣ginary hero,
chuses, for his source, manners in ge∣neral. His margin cannot swell with
authorities, nor can he—by way of notes—cite the contrary opinions
of great men concerning the vices or vir∣tues of those characters he
celebrates. So they possess the same qualities in common with the
rest of mankind, and the events brought about by their means are such as
our observation points out to be natural, his task is completely performed;
and he has a right to expect as much credit for relating circumstances that
might have happened, as he <PB N="3" REF="36"/> who—as far as he can clear
his narrative from the cobwebs of tradition, and disentangle it from the
labyrinth of contradictory authority—records facts that did happen.</P>
<P>Romances are, figuratively, in nature; and, lite∣rally,
fictitious. They are intended, by lifting the mind above probability, to
enforce moral by figure and allegory: and they attain their end—and
indeed laudably—for they rouse those torpid minds into action which
cannot relish writings that are kept within the bounds of simple
nature.</P>
<P>This species of composition is remarkably grati∣fying to
weak minds. It is—if I may be permitted so to express
myself—an honourable fraud; for, exaggerate the beauty of virtue how
you can, it will still be lovely; whereas vice, being ugly in itself,
becomes more hideous when it is carica∣tured.</P>
<P>These three different vehicles for the conveyance of truth and
morality, seem to require different conductors; and indeed it has seldom
happened that any one man has equally succeeded in them.—Romance
seems to require a poetic soul: strong in conception, fertile in
invention, and various in ex∣pression. History wants nothing but a
perspicuous <PB N="4" REF="37"/> style, authentic information, and
invincible vera∣city.</P>
<P>He who writes novels must partake of all these qualities. He
must unite in his imagination the glow of poetry with the steadiness of
narrative.—The latter must be as a curb to the former: not, however, to
damp its spirit, but to prevent it from running away:—like the
alderman, who, at a lord mayor's feast, would have made himself sick if
his physician had not sat by the side of him.</P>
<P>Thus I think it becomes pretty evident that novel writing holds
a very respectable stand in literature, and I sincerely believe that men
of considerable ta∣lents would very often practise it, were it not for
those spurious productions with which the press teems under the
appellation of novels, which means any love story calculated to madden the
minds of sentimental country ladies, to trouble the domestic happiness of
old gentlemen who marry young girls, and to overturn the purity imbibed at
boarding schools.</P>
<P>These are sure to make their way into all the cir∣culating
libraries in the kingdom, provided they are sufficiently stuffed with dying
lovers, inexorable parents, and impertinent chambermaids; with the 
<PB N="5" REF="38"/> addition of three or four elopements, half a dozen duels,
and an attempt or two at a rape; to which may be added, a little suicide, or
a smattering of incest—especially if it be written by a
lady—by way of zest, to make it go down the more glib.</P>
<P>Being about to give a novel to the world, I thought it incumbent
on me to say thus much; from which the reader will naturally conclude that I
intend, throughout this work, to keep nature and proba∣bility in sight, to
reject that which is frivolous and impertinent, and to adopt only what, by
means of amusement, may bring about instruction.</P>
<P>It will nevertheless be necessary to say further, that,
in portraying nature, I shall make her neither a flattering likeness, nor a
caricature. Nor is it ne∣cessary; for, let her sit for her picture ever
so often, she never will exhibit the same face twice, yet shall the
general resemblance always be striking; for it has been well observed,
that she takes every various hue of the camelion, yet, torture her how you
will, her form is as constant as the polypus. No two hu∣man faces, though
composed of the same features, ever were known to be correctly alike, and
the lu∣minous mind of LAVATER, did he attempt the ar∣duous and absurd task
of searching for any such would exactly resemble the lanthorn of
AESOP.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="39"/> To these general remarks—which I
conceived it expedient to place here—I shall add particular ones
whenever they appear to be necessary, and now I invite the reader to the
examination of a faithful, though a bold, representation of human life, for I
declare upon my word as a man, there is not a cha∣racter or circumstance in
this whole work which I do not experimentally know from a close
observa∣tion and mankind, to have virtual existence.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER II.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>CONTAINS A DESCRIPTION—TWO HOUSES—A
CITIZEN—AND A REFLECTION UPON DEATH.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>A BRIDGE thrown over the high road, at the en∣trance of a
village in Warwickshire, called Castle∣wick, is the separation of two
estates, one of which had been, at the period this history commences, for
half a century in the possession of the family of Ha∣zard, and the
other, for almost treble that space, in the family of Roebuck.</P>
<P>Nature had been equally bountiful in the distribu∣tion of her
favours on either side of the road, which fortuitous advantage art had been
industriously called in to improve. If a neat hamlet and a white spire
gave a more modern termination to the view, through a group of pines and
cedars, from Hazard lawn; an old market town and a contiguous moul∣dering
castle became visible, through an avenue of elms, from Roebuck park.</P>
<P>Every Chinese temple, urn, or statue, on one side, erected
to fancy, consecrated to friendship, or dedicated to the arts, had, on the
other, its rival <PB N="8" REF="41"/> grotto, cavern, or hermitage. Here was
seen a clump of elms, there a row of oaks; while the me∣andering
avon—lest the lord of one mansion should be jealous of its favours
lavished on the other—not only by the advantage of a distant height,
plunged up a rocky cliff to delight one favourite with the awful concussion
of a beautiful cascade, which fall∣ing, lessened into a gurgling rivulet;
but, also, opening its smooth, capacious bosom, moved on in majestic
silence, through the possessions of the other; stretching out on
one side a small, irregular stream, which supplied the house, watered
the gar∣den, and turned the village mill.</P>
<P>Old Rust, the grandfather of Lord Hazard, was a skinner in
the city. His profession unluckily made him rather a bye-word; for he had
such a vo∣racious thirst, or hunger, after money—for gold can be both
eaten and drank—that it was archly said he would skin any thing for
profit. Nay, some are of opinion that, from this very remark, originated the
epithet skinflint. Be that as it may, he cer∣tainly amassed a very large
fortune, and having run through the regular progression of livery-man,
common council-man, deputy, alderman, sheriff, and lord mayor, he married in
his seventy-first year, a girl of sixteen, without a sixpence, who bore
him—or somebody else—a son, portioned three of 
<PB N="9" REF="42"/> her sisters, granted a pension to an Irish
relation, set up a coach, and bought a villa; till at length, having
expostulated, stormed, threatened, prayed, and entreated, to no purpose,
poor Rust—think of it with horror ye antiquated Adonises—died
raving mad in St. Luke's hospital.</P>
<P>Previous to his insanity, however, he took care to make a
will, vesting his whole possessions in the hands of trustees, for
the use of his son. His re∣mains were, therefore, scarcely laid in the
earth, when the widow, with a moderate annuity, was obliged to sink into
retirement; and of her it will not be necessary to say more than that
she died when her son, who was purposely kept from her by his guardians,
came to be eighteen years old.</P>
<P>Young Rust, besides the possession of uncommon
talents, was wonderfully calculated for commerce. Before he was thirty he
considerably augmented his deceased father's wealth; and, a few years
after∣wards—having bought a large estate which gave him the entire
nomination of four members of par∣liament—he became so material an
object to the minister, that he was made one of those peers which it was
then expedient to create, lest the balance of power in the constitution
should be found to lean too much to the side of the people.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="43"/> No longer Mr. Rust, then, but Baron
Hazard, he pulled down the old mansion on the estate he had purchased,
and built that very chateau we have al∣ready commemorated. As he had a towering
am∣bition, he now married into an honourable family, not overburdened with
riches; was shortly blest with several children; and had made some
rapid strides towards an improvement in both church and state;
but—so transitory is the felicity of lords, as well as inferior
beings—he did not live long to en∣joy that success his hopes seemed
to promise:—for, sitting up a whole night to compose a speech,
which was to have introduced a plan to destroy pluralities, and root out
corruption, he caught a cold, which being followed by a fever, he was hurried
out of the world, having scarcely time to settle his affairs.</P>
<P>The young lord—but here, kind reader, let us both give a
sigh to the memory of Lord Hazard, and admire that the wisest designs
in this sublunary existence are liable, like a grain of sand, to be
scat∣tered at the will of providence!</P>

<PB REF="44"/>
<HEAD>CHAPTER III.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>CONTAINING ONE APPEAL TO THE HOUSE OF LORDS—AND ANOTHER
TO THE READER.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE young lord—for we shall have no occasion for the
rest of the family—saw himself his own mas∣ter at a very early
period of life; a circumstance which, together with dissipated company at
the uni∣versity, and a profligate tutor, contributed to form in him the
strongest principles of debauchery and libertinism.</P>
<P>When he became of age, his licentiousness made him the
terror of the neighbourhood. It is true he was a little checked in his wild
career by the wise and wholesome counsels of his mother, to which he at
first affected to listen; but, becoming more and more hardened, her
precepts and conduct were al∣together disregarded; till at length, worn out
with preaching to no purpose, she retired into the bosom of her own
family, with a firm determination to consider herself entirely alienated
from her disgra∣cious son.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="45"/> Lord Hazard being now left to the unbridled
in∣fluence of his headstrong passions, stopt at nothing to gratify
them. The farmers' wives and daughters, if they had the smallest
pretensions to beauty, were sure to become objects first of his
generosity, then his gratification, and afterwards his neglect: or, if they
durst dispute his impetuous wishes, his un∣alterable resentment. But,
as the swiftest cannon ball, which neither edifices of wood nor stone can
oppose, may be stopt in its very strongest velocity by the dull
resistance of a wool pack, so were the vehement pursuits of Lord Hazard
effectually checked by that dullest of all dull things, accord∣ing to the
bachelors—ay, and many of the married men too—a wife.</P>
<P>My lord's tutor, whose name was Viney, and who, as I hinted
before, had the highest ascendancy over his pupil—having ever been
cnofiderably more useful to him in the conduct of his love affairs than in
his study of the classics—had also another pupil. Indeed his
attention to this last mentioned scholar, on whom he had expended a large
part of that money which the bounty to Lord Hazard—for his lordship was
liberal to excess—had lavished on him, would appear very enigmatical
did we not derive it from its natural motive.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="46"/> This scholar then was no other than his
sister, who, without a penny, had married an Irish for∣tune hunter, and
was very shortly saved the trouble of breaking his heart by a kind friend
of his, who killed him in a duel. Viney had connived at this marriage, which,
soon after it was consummated, was found to be a mutual bite. However, as
his sister was left a blooming widow of twenty-two, he easily comforted
himself by considering her market as not yet over. In a word, he had long
in idea married her to Lord Hazard. This will account for his generosity:
nor, when it is considered how completely this same Mr. Viney ruled his
pupil, will it appear very unaccountable that the lady should become at
length in reality what she had long been in imagination.</P>
<P>Marriage stopt for a while the excesses of Lord Hazard. He
doated on his wife; and, having taken this step, Viney became his privy
counsellor in a stronger degree than ever. His tone, however, was soon
changed. He found her a mixture of arro∣gance, meanness, bridled
wantonness, and ignorant affectation. Nor is it difficult to divine where it
might have ended if he had not accidentally disco∣vered, after having been
about three months blessed with an heir, that she had an intrigue with
his valet de chamber.</P>
<PB N="14" REF="47"/>
<P>This roused him at once. She was properly de∣tected, the
necessary steps were taken, and a divorce obtained. She recriminated,
indeed, but he was a lord, and his success certain. Thus, having re∣ceived
satisfaction for the injuries he had sustained, he legally banished her
for ever from his presence, granting her only a decent provision for
life.</P>
<P>Any one experienced in the human heart will easily see the
part Viney took upon his sister's de∣tection. He exclaimed against her
with the great∣est violence, and was the forwardest in procuring his
lordship that redress which he knew it was not in his power to prevent.</P>
<P>This conduct established him more firmly than ever in the
good graces and household of Lord Ha∣zard; the first of which advantages he
often de∣clared—loudly to the world—was the ultimate end of all his
wishes; because, said he—softly to him∣self—it brings
about the other.</P>
<P>I have already shewn that marriage proved a pret∣ty tight curb
to the excesses of this young noble∣man, and one would think his divorce
had given him a reasonable surfeit of marriage; but, I know not how it is,
some men seem to be the bubble of their own arts: their whole study is to
overreach <PB N="15" REF="48"/> themselves, and if they stumble on tolerable
con∣tent, it is because things take a different turn from what they
designed.</P>
<P>Thus it happened with our peer. Every resolu∣tion he took, in
consequence of being a widower, was wrong; and yet he hit upon happiness
when he only meant revenge.</P>
<P>This was his argument. He had married a wo∣man of spirit, who
had injured him in the strongest degree, and, for this indignity, he was
determined to take vengeance on her whole sex; idly forgetting that this was
revenging himself on a whole hive, for the sting of a single bee.
Besides, he himself was to blame: the fault lay in his own want of
discern∣ment. Had he fairly examined the ground of the business, he would
have plainly seen that it origi∣nated with Viney, who had taught him nothing
but what disgraced his birth, and deprived him of the use of that valuable
goodness of heart which he re∣ally possessed, and which, had he
fallen into proper hands, might have induced him to have dispensed the
gifts of fortune nobly instead of licentiously.</P>
<P>To put this worthy project in execution, Lord Hazard resolved
once more to try the married state, resolutely vowing to conduct himself
in so authori∣tative <PB N="16" REF="49"/> a manner to his second wife, that
she should not dare even to think without his previous permis∣sion. He
had scarcely come to this resolution, but his uneasiness on his late
disgrace vanished. He looked round for a wife with the greatest
eagerness, till at length, with Viney's assistance, who was still
consulted, he thought he had found one to his wish.</P>
<P>But how was he astonished when he plainly saw it would be
impossible to avail himself of any one of those prudent determinations,
those ingenious precautions he had been so long and so industriously
arming himself with. He had now such a wife that to controul her was
impossible; to advise her, use∣less!</P>
<P>If my readers think he was again caught, after so much wary
and cautious resolution, after such an∣ticipation of success, I hope it
will be confessed he deserved it.</P>
<P>Certainly he was disappointed, but in that satis∣factory way
that a man would be at finding a lawyer who, taking a brief, should refuse
a fee. Lady Hazard could not be controuled, advised, or en∣treated; for she
had so high a sense of her duty, such equanimity of temper, and such
sweetness of <PB N="17" REF="50"/> manners, that she anticipated her
lord's very wishes. He had received her from her father, a wealthy country
neighbour, who wanted to aggrandize his family. The young lady, who had all her
life made it her study to please her father, found it no irksome task
to watch and comply with the tempers of her husband:—so true it is
that a dutiful daughter has gone a great way towards becoming a good wife.</P>
<P>If ever an extraordinary event new moulded a man's mind, this
unexpected merit in his wife had that effect on Lord Hazard. He saw in an
instant that his whole life had been one delusion; that while he had
sought for pleasure, he had neglected happiness; and, therefore,
resolved doubly to cherish it, since it had complacently condescended
to come home to him.</P>
<P>Nobody had ever dared to tell him he was a dupe to Viney: he now
saw it himself. He did not, how∣ever, think proper to withdraw his
protection from him, but contented himself only with giving him a handsome
rectory, to which that worthy incumbent shortly removed.</P>
<P>In about a twelvemonth after this second mar∣riage—but
hold, all great events should be ushered in with cautious preparation.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="51"/> A watchmaker would have called the
circum∣stance I am about to celebrate the main spring of this history; a
sailor would have said it was its helm; and an alderman its marrow.</P>
<P>It is something, therefore, of material conse∣quence; and,
of course, proper to be given in a new chapter, and with a particular
introduction:—all which ceremony, though it may be the limbs and outward
flourishes of writing, is not without its use; and though more than PHEDRUS
have said that a tree should be estimated by its fruit, and not by its
leaves, yet it must be considered, that, with∣out the proper shelter
afforded by the leaves, no fruit could arrive to perfection.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER IV.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>WHICH—FIRST ADJUSTING A VERY ABSTRUSE DOGMA IN
LI∣TERATURE—INTRODUCES THE HERO TO THE READER.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>IT falls out sometimes at the theatre, that, at the very
moment the audience are sitting with expec∣tation on its utmost stretch,
an actor, with a woe-begone countenance, comes on the stage to an∣nounce the
indisposition of the principal actress.</P>
<P>This once happened of Desdemona; and, as there was no lady in
the company competent to the part but her whose name was in the bills, a
gentleman undertook it at a very short warning. The spec∣tators were, as
usual, content per force; but, after waiting a considerable time, the
apologizer was a second time obliged to come on, who assured the audience
the play would soon begin, but at present Desdemona was not shaved.</P>
<P>I hope it will not be thought, by mentioning this case in
point, that I mean to introduce in a ludi∣crous way, a matter of such eminent
importance as that I now take the liberty of presenting to the 
<PB N="20" REF="53"/> reader's notice; but, my <HI>amour propre</HI> is wounded:
for being forced—at the very critical moment I considered myself
happy beyond all example in the mode of introducing my hero—to stopt
short, and put my readers in the exact situation of the specta∣tors above
described, I am obliged to exculpate myself from any intentional offence by
fairly laying the truth before them, and humbly appealing to their candour:
or—according to the language of the standing theatrical
apology—their usual indul∣gence.</P>
<P>I was going to begin this chapter in a most lovely style, by
saying that the bees came about somebody's cradle, and left their honey on
his lips; giving proof that he would be sweet and eloquent in dis∣course.
But, casting in my mind who this some∣body could be, it presently
struck me—for I 
<Q REND="inline">"do bear a brain"</Q>—that the point was
not settled.</P>
<P>This prodigy is related of ST. AMBROSE of Milan. Doctor JOHNSON,
who ought to have known some∣thing about the matter, says it was PINDAR;
but FENELON affirms it was said of PLATO by his pre∣ceptor SENECA, who, while
the circumstance was warm in his mind, dreamt that a cygnet flew to his
bosom, which, by degrees, became covered with feathers of a most beautiful
and dazzling whiteness; <PB N="21" REF="54"/> and which, taking wing, flew
with a force and ra∣pidity superior to an eagle:—and these prodigies
were so strongly verified in this great man, that CICERO said of him,
when he grew up, 
<Q REND="inline">"If JUPI∣TER had condescended to speak like
man, he would have used the language of PLATO."</Q></P>
<P>Now it cannot be denied but that here is proof upon proof on the
side of FENELON; and, as he ga∣thered this intelligence for the improvement
of princes, one would think that he must have made a point of collecting his
materials from the best au∣thorities. But as there is no court of criticism
to appeal to from the fiat of Dr. JOHNSON—his <HI>ipse dixit</HI> being
always final upon these occasions—if the reader please it shall
stand for PINDAR: not for the living PINDAR, because every body knows that,
in∣stead of honey, he deals in nothing but gall.</P>
<P>In this case it is melancholy to lose the beautiful dream of
SENECA, and the fine saying of CICERO, but ornament and flourish must
give way to truth and Dr. JOHNSON. Besides, Mr. BOSWELL informs us that the
Doctor had but a pitiful opinion of FE∣NELON, for that he would not allow
Telemachus to be written more than 
<Q REND="inline">"pretty well."</Q></P>
<P>Having established this important point, I shall 
<PB N="22" REF="55"/> regularly proceed to the business of introducing my
hero, who having set the poets together by the ears before he was born, will
be allowed to have given a pretty good specimen of the work he was to cut out
for them afterwards.</P>
<P>Many and various are the portents and omens that are said to
have announced the births, deaths, and marriages of great men and women; and I
could muster up a long catalogue of them, from the lady who made so
handsome a deluge as to swallow up all Asia, to Tom Thumb—which is
a pretty touch of the bathos—who was swallowed up by a cow; but that it
would insensibly draw me into an imitation of certain authors, who are
fonder of shewing their reading than their good manners.</P>
<P>I shall be forgiven however, since a great man and a prodigy
are almost synonimous terms, if I la∣ment that nature did not go a single
step out of her road to introduce our hero: neither his father nor his mother
having dreamt any thing prodigious on the occasion.</P>
<P>Viney indeed had a confused idea in a dream of a basilisk
which kept continually in his way, and the nurse, as she nodded by the fire
side while Lady Ha∣zard was in labour, dreamt that her young master— 
<PB N="23" REF="56"/> for she always said it would be a boy—spoke
the mo∣ment he came into the world, and that he believed any thing you said
to him; which she sagaciously interpreted as a sure sign that he
would be very learned, and very much imposed upon:—the truth of which
observation the reader may perhaps have occasion to admire before he and I
part.</P>
<P>Lady Hazard's being brought to bed of a son, to the great joy
of that honourable family, seems then to be the event I hinted at in the
third chap∣ter. It really took place about a twelve month after the marriage,
and three years and a quarter—for I love to be exact—after the
birth of the first son, whom Lord Hazard called Zekiel, after his
grand∣father, and this, our hero, Charles, after himself.</P>
<P>The happiness of Lord Hazard would now have been complete, had
it not been imbittered by a con∣sideration that the whole estate being
willed away with the title, he could not do his youngest son the justice
he wished. To amend, however, this defi∣ciency, he resolved to make him a
paragon of learn∣ing; and, as he knew very well that had not the former part of
his own life been devoted to idleness, it would have been less given to
dissipation, he re∣solved to add a complete study of the arts to his
son's education.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="57"/> In the contemplation of this plan he took
great delight. At length, when Zekiel had attained his eleventh year, he was
sent to Eaton school, to leave the coast clear for a proper attention to
the educa∣tion of Charles, which his lordship was determined to superintend
himself.</P>
<P>Many essays were made upon his tender intellects, which gave
very promising hopes; and now the difficulty was to get him a tutor. Lord
Hazard fairly owned he despaired of finding one to his wish. He declared he
had himself witnessed so much ill conduct in men of that description,
that he should be very cautious indeed how he made a choice.</P>
<P>These doubts he often imparted to Lady Hazard, who said
she had mixed very little in the world, and therefore was happy whenever he
was so good as to give her his opinion, in order that she might form hers.
She could not help thinking, however, that he was warmer on that subject than
he otherwise would have been, had not an ill choice been made in a tutor for
him. She hoped he would be able to find a man who should have talents, and
yet be honest.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'If,' said my lord, 'I could form a tutor, he
should be ingenuous above all things; not ashamed <PB N="25" REF="58"/> if
he found any of those trivial vices creeping on him to which human nature is
subject, to confess and amend them. Such a kind of man cannot design to
do ill, because he is sorry for his own infirmity. Ingenuousness has a
tendency to gratitude, which is with me the first of vir∣tues. I declare if I
was obliged to accuse a man of a crime, and he could prove his motive to be
in the smallest degree similar to any thing I had ever forgiven in
myself, I should instantly feel an inclination to pardon him. It is the
sneaking, un∣derhand villain I hate; the hypocrite, the de∣ceiver, who
studies to be a rascal; who stings while he fawns. But he who acts from
mere in∣tuitive principles, may correct his frailty by his judgment; and, at
any rate, you have a declared enemy, and know how to be on your guard. One
stands some chance with a lion, but who can pro∣vide against the venom of
a slow worm?'</Q></P>
<P>Thus ended a conversation which the reader may hereafter think
I had a reason for inserting.</P>
<P>Very little passed in this family worthy relation till
Master Charles was twelve years old, when one day my lord brought a gentleman
who, he said, an∣swered, in every particular, that description of
per∣son he had so long and so fruitlessly sought for, as 
<PB N="26" REF="59"/> a tutor for his darling son. As to Zekiel, he did not
believe him to be his son at all, though he had in vain tried to prove him
legally illegitimate. He therefore took very little further notice of him than
to remit him money; nor did he express either as∣tonishment or
dissatisfaction at being told he was both an arrant dunce and an arrant
puppy. On the contrary, he sarcastically observed 
<Q REND="inline">"he would do well enough for a lord."</Q></P>
<P>Having brought matters in the family of Lord Hazard to a sort
of stand still, the reader and I will now, if he please, take a walk
across the bridge into Roebuck park. But, upon recollection, being come now
to the center which commands a view of the whole village of Castlewick, and
its inhabitants making a part of our dramatis personae, we will take a
short view of that little community, which had really something to
recommend it to our notice.</P>

<DIV2 N="5" TYPE="chapter">
<PB REF="60"/>
<HEAD>CHAPTER V.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>IN WHICH A VILLAGE IS DESCRIBED, NOT UNLIKE AN ANT-HILL.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE village of Castlewick contained about five hundred
inhabitants. About half the men and boys were generally employed at the trade
of wool-comb∣ing; part of the women and girls in carding, spin∣ning,
twisting, and knitting; the more intelligent and experienced of the men in
journeying to large towns to purchase sheep, and supply factors,
clothiers, and hosiers with wool, yarn, worsted, stockings, nightcaps,
socks, and such other articles as they manufactured. The lower order of the
men and boys were employed in tilling, manuring, and enclosing; and the
remainder of the women busied themselves in household affairs, buying and
selling the necessaries of life, and such other occupations as the
vicar—for this parish had no curate—pointed out to them.</P>
<P>The vicar had two deputies, the clerk and the schoolmaster;
and these three were all the persons in the village who did no bodily
labour:—for Cas∣tlewick <PB N="28" REF="61"/> could boast neither
lawyer, exciseman, nor apothecary.</P>
<P>Their good pastor undertook to regulate the tem∣poral, as well
as spiritual, concerns of his flock; and, by a scrupulous discharge of
his duty as their treasurer, shewed them more than by a thousand precepts
how much it was their interest to act with truth and integrity towards each
other. Not that his preaching was not of a piece with his example, for every
Sunday they heard some new lesson of sweet and comfortable morality
from his mouth; for he, instead of describing religion as a denunci∣ation
of vengeance, and the deity as delighting in punishment, softened that high
duty into a gentle and intelligent system of morality, by inculcating the
principles of social virtue and brotherly love, and representing the
creator as an indulgent father watching with anxious and tender care over the
in∣terest and happiness of his children, and regarding their virtuous
endeavours with a smile of celestial benevolence:—thus troubling his
hearers with no∣thing beyond the reach of that capacity which had fallen to
their share, and leaving the discussion of dogmas to larger
communities, who better under∣stood cavilling.</P>
<P>The clerk and the schoolmaster kept an account 
<PB N="29" REF="62"/> of the receipts and disbursements throughout the
parish. These were faithfully audited by the vicar. Ten of the most
considerable of the inhabitants, who acted as a committee for the rest,
were called in every week to the vestry, where the books were always forth
coming for general inspection.</P>
<P>Every other regulation for the pleasure and ad∣vantage of this
happy community was proportion∣ably wise and salutary. Thus cheerfulness
smiled on their labours; content converted their pittance into plenty;
health, ease, and good humour accom∣panied their steps, and they passed
their time in the exercise of as much moral rectitude as would have
immortalized them—had they been born an∣cient Spartans—without
dreaming they did more than a common duty, for the sake of general
conve∣nience.</P>
<P>By this time I believe the reader begins to suspect that the
vicar, however well disposed to lend a help∣ing hand towards the regulation
of this little com∣monwealth, as well as the clerk and the school∣master,
who kept the account of their finances, were but subordinate actors in this
performance, and here introduced, like the centinels in Hamlet and the
servants in the Orphan—both of which circumstances VOLTAIRE is very
angry at—only to usher in the ca∣pital <PB N="30" REF="63"/>
personage, who, having once made his appear∣ance, is to receive all the
applause.</P>
<P>It must be owned that the motions of Castlewick appeared to
be as regular as those of its church clock, which clock, though any
blacksmith could wind it up, and set it a going, must have required a
much better mechanic to have invented it origi∣nally. If there should be a
hidden first cause for this, it will be announced in its proper place. In
the mean time I cannot prevail upon myself to re∣pent my having introduced
these sons of industry, insignificant as they are. The mind is often
both improved and amused by the most trifling objects: the smaller the
mite the more worthy the curiosity of the philosopher.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER VI.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>WHICH PROVES THAT SOME OF THE OLD FASHIONS ARE NOT TO BE
DESPISED.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>MY reader and I having passed through the rookery that
received us as we left the bridge, are now within sight of the mansion of
Sir Sydney Wal∣ter Roebuck, lord of the manor of Castlewick, and member of
parliament for the borough of Neither∣side.</P>
<P>The grandfather of this gentleman—for were I to trouble
the reader with any thing anterior, my description would resemble a game of
chess, where bishops, knights, castles, and the king and queen are
continually crossing each other. Indeed I have two other reasons for not
going farther back; one is, that in the course of this history Sir Sidney
will talk to us a little about the fame of his ancestors him∣self; and the
other, that, for ought I could ever learn, their lives were, take them all in
all, such a uniform mixture of morality, loyalty, and bro∣therly love, that
the description of one would serve for the whole. Their tempers might not
be unaptly <PB N="32" REF="65"/> compared to a bowl of punch, for though made up
of the same contrariety of ingredients in common with the rest of their
fellow creatures, the mixture was so happily blended, that they diffused
comfort and cheerfulness to all around them.</P>
<P>The grandfather then having taken umbrage at court for being
turned out of the cabinet, only be∣cause he maintained that the Lancashire
witches were harmless old women—for which indeed Dr. JOHNSON would have
been as angry with him as the council were, for he tells us he will not say
there never was any such thing as witchcraft, for that probably there might
have been, but that it had ceased—retired to the mansion of his
forefathers, which gothic and stately structure the reader and I are
looking at.</P>
<P>There having sat contentedly down, with a quiet conscience,
an active mind, and a princely fortune, he considered—which was nothing
more than his daily custom—how he might best be serviceable to his
fellow creatures.</P>
<P>He had not deliberated long on the subject before he
determined to build the village of Castlewick, and, like another Bishop
Blaze, set up the trade of wool-combing. Nor was this, would he argue, a 
<PB N="33" REF="66"/> project unworthy his rank; wool was the staple commodity
of that country he so dearly loved, and for which his ancestors had so
gallantly shed their blood; the wool sack was the emblem of honour, for it
sustained the leading member of the house, and took place in that
assembly of every thing but the throne. He had yet a better reason: his
scheme would give employment to his tenants and other poor neighbours, and he
should be sure to receive the daily blessings of many families who
would owe a subsistance to their honest labours, under the au∣spices
of his bounty.</P>
<P>This gentleman lived to see his benevolent plan carried into
execution, and he enjoined his son to pursue it. This injunction was
faithfully complied with, but the present Sir Sidney considerably
in∣creased the number of houses and inhabitants, al∣tered the former rules
and orders into a more regu∣lar and digested set of laws, and called in the
vicar and his adherents, as the reader has already seen, to assist him
in their execution.</P>
<P>Thus, burning the Lancashire witches was pro∣ductive of one
public benefit at least; for, had not the humanity of good old Sir Sidney
taken fire at the cruel proposition, in all probability the village of
Castlewick would never have been built.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="67"/> The surviving gentleman of this family I
now take the liberty of introducing in form to the rea∣der. He had many
singularities: one I have al∣ready hinted at: another was a fixed aversion
to cards and dice; yet he was a strenuous encourager of all athletic
sports. He would sometimes pitch the bar himself, and was allowed to be
the best bowler at cricket within ten miles. He was an ad∣mirer of the arts,
and never failed to bring with him from town, at the end of every
sessions, a poet, a painter, and a musician, who were obliged—and
so indeed were all others who wished for his esteem—to accompany
him in the different departments of his duty, as he called the regulation of
his little commonwealth. Nay sometimes he would set them to work, on which
occasion he enjoyed their awk∣wardness.</P>
<P>Seeing once the wig of a counsellor catch in the girt of a
twisting mill, as he was unhandily turning it round, it afforded no small
diversion to the ba∣ronet, who facetiously exclaimed, 
<Q REND="inline">"My good old friend, you let your learning fly
about at a strange rate."</Q></P>
<P>No man was more admired, nor sought less to be so, than
Sir Sidney. Even the boobies, with whom he could not mix, because he never
swore, gamed, <PB N="35" REF="68"/> nor drank pint bumpers, declared he was a
gruffish odd sort of a hearty cock. In short, his heart was benevolent,
his means were ample, he was in the prime of life, surrounded with hundreds
of sin∣cere friends—which is a bold thing to say-re∣spected,
valued, esteemed, adored, almost deified, and yet he was not happy. I could
tell the reader why, but shall only so far indulge him as to say that,
according to Sir Sidney's own account, his unhappiness was occasioned by a
phantom he had seen, which had so possessed him, that he could not
rest in his bed till he had opened his mind to it:—for, were I to
unriddle the whole secret of this ghost, the spirit and the reader's
curiosity would vanish together.</P>
<P>I shall therefore collect together all the leading
circumstances, that I may the more adroitly intro∣duce the time when, the
place where, and the man∣ner how, it appeared. And this has been a privi∣lege
to authors and old women time immemorial; a climax having ever been allowed the
proper mo∣ment to introduce a catastrophe, and the candle's burning blue a
signal for the approach of a hob∣goblin.</P>
<P>As soon, therefore, as I shall have terrified my readers
into a belief of the proper prognostic, the <PB N="36" REF="69"/> ghost
shall stalk forth. To suffer this sooner would be inartificial, and
consequently an impeachment of my capacity of tantalizing the reader, which
would be an indelible disgrace to the fraternity of novel writers, some of
whom have excited no other sen∣sation.</P>
<P>I hope, however, I shall be forgiven if I differ in the main
from this mode of constructing my work, and not deemed an innovator if I
endeavour to make satisfaction keep pace with expectation.</P>

<PB REF="70"/>
<HEAD>CHAPTER VII.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>CONTAINING THE NECESSARY SHADOW, TO HEIGHTEN THE BEAUTIES OF
CASTLEWICK.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>I MEAN to lead the reader on, chapter after chap∣ter, through
this history, in the same manner as we are led, day after day, through
life. They who experience the largest portions of human happiness, are
sure to have some unpleasant moments in every four-and-twenty hours;
whereas the same degree of misery will not so far overcome the fortitude
of others: but they find now and then a transient gleam of pleasure, which,
like an accidental creek through the wall of a dungeon, magnifies the light of
comfort, by peeping in upon obscurity.</P>
<P>At the close of every dull day, we naturally look forward in
hopes of finding the next more agree∣able. Thus people comfort themselves
with 
<Q REND="inline">"to∣morrow is a new day;"—"we shall
see how mat∣ters will go to-morrow;"</Q> and thus cherish a laudable
expectation, though it end perhaps only in disappoinment.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="71"/> I am led to these remarks by the
recollection of my having promised to tell the reader what Sir Sid∣ney wanted
to make him completely happy. To do this suddenly, and without preparation,
would seem to shew that I know not the way to elevate and surprise; a
mystery which more than Mr. Bayes have thought the most essential
requisite of an au∣thor.</P>
<P>As no reader, therefore, can reasonably desire me to violate
a standing rule, I shall now proceed to unfold a nice chain of
circumstances, which will lead directly to the main event.</P>
<P>In the description that has been given of Castle∣wick, I
more than doubt I have been shrewdly sus∣pected of that kind of
embellishment in which heroes are said to deal when speaking of their
ex∣ploits, and lovers when extolling the charms of their mistresses. In
fact, to suppose a body of nearly five hundred people, of different
sexes, ages, and complexions, could be perfectly secure from evil in
themselves, or guarded against the tempta∣tions of others, would be to
suppose an order of be∣ings that certainly shall not intrude themselves
here, my intention being to treat of human creatures, the best of whom, I am
afraid, are not exempt from frailty. I would only have it understood that
vices <PB N="39" REF="72"/> existed in Castlewick no longer than till they
were found out; at which time the parties were, for the first offence,
reprehended; for a second, mulct; for a third, condemned to have no
intercourse with their neighbours; and, for a fourth, considered as
incorrigible; and, without favour or affection, ba∣nished from the place, and
deprived for ever of any claim to its advantages.</P>
<P>When this happened, which I will say was very seldom, the
offenders generally took refuge in an∣other village, about three miles
distant, called Little Hockley, the inhabitants of which place were mostly
tenants of Lord Hazard; and, as that nobleman had found no great difficulty in
bringing over the men, and the women too, to any of his purposes, it may
easily be supposed they were a very likely people to afford such a
left-handed asylum.</P>
<P>Little Hockley then was as famous for springes, trammel nets,
and pitched battles, as Castlewick was for cricket, quoits, and tranquillity;
and if one was without an attorney, that a proper number of that worthy
fraternity might be kept up, the other maintained two. Nay, a spruce young
man, who indeed had been porter to an obscure druggist, in a blind alley
near Rosemary-lane, established him∣self there as an apothecary, who,
when Lord Ha∣zard <PB N="40" REF="73"/> first began to reside at his seat,
ordered a new sign, and added to his former qualifications surgeon and
man-midwife.</P>
<P>One great pleasure of the wicked wights of Little Hockley, was
to torment their more fortunate neigh∣bours of Castlewick, This they effected
by certain railings and backbitings; to which exploits of their fancy, they
added others, which were achieved by means of their fingers; for scarcely a
week past but some hog was hamstrung, horse lamed, or house dog
hanged. Sucking pigs and chickens disappear∣ed from their sties and
roosts, without the assistance of a fox; the cows were milked in the
night by two-handed urchins, and lambs ran away with by two-legged wolves.</P>
<P>These depredations ceased now and then, upon Sir Sidney's
application to Lord Hazard, but they constantly broke out again. In the mean
time, cer∣tain defiances were breathed, and sometimes a few blows
exchanged.</P>
<P>The vicar was not without frequent apprehen∣sions that some
of his parishioners, meeting with so many insulting provocations, and
being healthy, spi∣rited men, would once for all take such a revenge as
might involve the community in trouble; for one <PB N="41" REF="74"/> or two of
them had been already cited to the quar∣ter sessions, where it required
the whole interest of Sir Sidney to prevent their paying heavy damages,
though what they did was perhaps in resentment of some insult offered to
a wife or daughter.</P>
<P>At the time Lord Hazard petitioned the lords for his divorce,
Sir Sidney was attending with great earnestness his duty in the lower
house. Taking advantage of this opportunity, a month had scarcely
passed before the Hockley men, grown more au∣dacious than ever, had
irritated their peaceable neighbours so often, that three stout bruising
matches had already been the consequence; and though the Hockley boxers would
have cut no contemptible figure in the learned Mr. MENDOZA's school, yet it
so happened—perhaps because a right cause is half the
victory—the men of Castlewick were the con∣querors.</P>
<P>Seeing matters at this extremity, and unwilling to trouble Sir
Sidney, the vicar determined to pay a visit to the curate of Little Hockley,
for that pa∣rish, which was a rectory, had not been blest with a sight of
its incumbent for ten years. Indeed that worthy member of the church, who was
also a mem∣ber of a gaming club, commuted for the tithes and all other
immunities of his living, and had given up, <PB N="42" REF="75"/> among other
advantages, the right of appointing a curate.</P>
<P>The gentleman who made this purchase lived in the
neighbourhood, and was called Major Malpla∣quet. He had distinguished
himself in the wars of the low countries, when very young, under the fa∣mous
Duke of MALBOROUGH, and was now late in life in quiet possession of his
paternal seat, and a very fine fortune.</P>
<P>The Major had a chaplain, who, it must be con∣fessed, did
not look much like a clergyman. He had been in the wars too, and indeed he
fought much better than he prayed. I will illustrate his charac∣ter by an
anecdote.</P>
<P>A clergyman being on a visit to a captain of a man of war, a
smart gale sprung up so suddenly that the vessel parted her cable,
and was hurried out to sea. No harm happened, but it gave the crew a great
deal of trouble. The boatswain, who in the language of his messmates, was
a dry hand, coming upon the forecastle, cried, 
<Q REND="inline">'Sink me if I did not think as this would be the
case. I will be keel∣hauled if we have had a bit of good luck since that
there parson came aboard. Of all the fish that swims, I cannot abide a
parson. I never sailed <PB N="43" REF="76"/> but once before with a
parson, and then we had not a fair wind the whole voyage.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Never but once!' said one of his companions,
'why a chaplain's parson, 'ent he?'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Avast that slack chatter,' said the
boatswain, 'a chaplain a parson, hey!'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Why I tell you he is,' says the other, 'he
wears black, and says prayers.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Why then I suppose,' retorted the
boatswain, 'the devil's an alderman because he wears horns.—All the
chaplains I ever knew were honest hearty cocks: good fellows, who would not
mind mak∣ing a curtain of their black gown, to hide a pretty lass. None of
your grave thinking gentlemen; but roaring boys, who <HI>shewing</HI> you
what they are, and <HI>telling</HI> you what they ought to be, leave you to
your choice whether you'll go to heaven by their preaching, or to the
southward by their ex∣ample.'</Q></P>
<P>This worthy member of the church militant, whose name was
Standfast, had, in his younger days—for he was now near
fifty—performed as many exploits of the buckish kind as ever
distinguished <PB N="44" REF="77"/> the Mohawks, Sweaters, or any other
set of despe∣rados who used formerly to parade the streets of London,
to the terror of every decrepid watchman, and the demolition of his lanthorn.
He was the very man who once proposed to give the waiter of a coffee-house
a rouleau, to see <HI>how he would look.</HI></P>
<P>Besides all this, he had killed his man; and, hav∣ing
absconded to Flanders, he ran away with a nun from a convent, married her,
spent her fortune, set her adrift, and entered a volunteer in the army,
where the officers—finding him a genteel man—be∣ing informed of his
function, procured him a chap∣laincy.</P>
<P>In this situation Standfast was particularly noticed by
Major Malplaquet, who being a man of singular credulity, so attached
himself to his new acquain∣tance, that he soon became his all in all.
Indeed the chaplain had many qualities that rendered him agreeable to the
major. He would drink claret, play at put, and beat a reveille, with any man in
the corps. Besides these winning accomplishments, he had other
accommodating methods of endearing himself to his patron. He often
complimented him with the possession of some yielding female he had
himself grown tired of, and never failed, if husbands or fathers grew
impertinent and troublesome, to <PB N="45" REF="78"/> brazen the matter out.
In short, having gained a consummate knowledge of the world, by a
scrupulous hardness of belief, a total want of every feeling but
self-interest, and a critical exercise of observation, he penetrated
every man's characteristic foible, and worked upon it as he pleased.</P>
<P>Such was the Rev. Mr. Standfast, private chaplain to Major
Malplaquet, and curate of Little Hock∣ley. To this person I am going to
introduce the vicar of Castlewick, who, conscious of the rectitude of his
own intentions, was indulging himself in the flattering hope that his
efforts, in conjunction with those of the curate, would effectually make up
every breach between the two contending parties.</P>

<PB REF="79"/>
<HEAD>CHAPTER VIII.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>BEING FULL OF PASTIME AND PRODIGALITY.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>To the qualities already celebrated in Tiger
Standfast—for so had he been nicknamed by his companions, from the
utter impossibility of taming him—I shall add, that, let him
converse with whom he might, he, as the phrase is, knew his man; and was
always provided with so many shifts and turns, that come what would he was
never off his guard. Besides he had an admirable knack of siding with his
enemy, the better to laugh at him,</P>
<P>I thought it necessary to premise this, lest the reader
should wonder how it came about that the moment he saw Mr. Mildman he
should not only welcome him with all imaginable courtesey, but de∣clare he
intended, the next morning, to have paid him a visit, in order to consult
with him on the very subject which had now brought them
together:—adding, as he took the good old vicar by the hand, that he had
a hard time of it indeed, but bad ex∣amples were terrible things, and if Lord
Hazard <PB N="47" REF="80"/> would encourage his tenants in
idleness—which Mr. Mildman's experience must have long taught him is
the corner stone of the temple of corruption—of what avail were all his
prayers, nay his tears, in en∣forcing either their duty towards God or their
neighbour.</P>
<P>The astonished vicar could scarcely credit his ears. He
had not to learn the general character of Standfast; but, on the contrary,
had both heard and believed much ill of him: and indeed, on his way, had
uncharitably, as he now thought, conjured up a number of difficulties in his
mind, which he expected would be thrown in the way of his benefi∣cent plan.</P>
<P>This Standfast well knew, and as the first blow in argument,
as well as boxing, is a manifest ad∣vantage, he had the inward
satisfaction—I say in∣ward because his features betrayed no such
sensation—of seeing his antagonist struck aghast.</P>
<P>To pursue this first blow, therefore, he thus went on. 
<Q REND="inline">'I see Mr. Mildman you are shocked to find I
have no more influence over my parishio∣ners.'</Q></P>
<P>The vicar, to whom truth was as habitual as per∣jury 
<PB N="48" REF="81"/> is to an attorney, with the utmost simplicity of heart
immediately answered: 
<Q REND="inline">'You have not at all divined the subject of my
astonishment. I was admiring that the world could be so unnecessarily
slanderous to have described you as a dissolute and immoral character,
and one who—pardon me for using the expression, was a scandal to
your cloth; whereas you appear to me—'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Ah,' cried Standfast, 'poor deluded wretches
I forgive them. But what do they say? It is of consequence that I should
clear my character to you. Their slander I smile at, but your ill opi∣nion!
What do they say, dear Mr. Mildman?'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Why Sir,' replied the vicar, 'since I see
you bear it with a proper firmness, I will tell you.'—</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Sit down sir,' said Standfast.</Q></P>
<P>The vicar having complied with his request, pro∣ceeded to
inform him that, in the first place, it was said he drank very hard for a
clergyman. 
<Q REND="inline">'Not a drop more, in general, than two bottles
at a sit∣ting,' said Standfast, 'and never more than four.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Four bottles!' exclaimed the vicar.</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Why what is that;' cried Standfast very
calmly, 'if, my dear sir, you had been in countries where I have, you must
have drank. Ay, ay, it is better to be car∣ried <PB N="49" REF="82"/> off to bed
in liquor than in an ague. Then, between ourselves, the major is a notable
toper; never stirs till the sixth bottle, though there should be only he
and I to drink it: and I dare not disoblige my patron: I hate ingratitude. I
only ask you Mr. Mildman if any thing could induce you to thwart the will of
Sir Sidney?'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Sir,' cried the vicar, with a look of extreme
sensibility, 'it is the study of my life to deserve his
bounty.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'That was spoken,' said Standfast, 'too
warmly not to have come from the heart. You must, my dear sir, pledge me in
a glass to Sir Sidney's health. Here bring some wine.'</Q></P>
<P>The vicar, who, though he never was drunk in his life, could
take a glass or two, and very fre∣quently did at Sir Sidney's table, made no
great difficulty to comply.</P>
<P>Two bottles of wine were immediately brought, two glasses
poured out, and soon emptied to the health of the vicar's patron. Standfast
asked Mr. Mildman if he liked his port as well as Sir Sidney's? at the same
time excusing himself from drinking any, saying that nothing but claret
agreed with him.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="83"/> The vicar commended the wine, but said it
had a dryish sour smack after it. 
<Q REND="inline">'<HI>Goute de la terreinne,</HI> nothing
else,' said Standfast, 'it is the very ex∣cellence of it.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Perhaps so,' said the vicar, 'but to our
business.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'No sir,' said Standfast, 'you shall
purge me of all my secret faults. It has long been my ambition to be known to
you, and I promise most truly, if you can use any fair argument before
you go, to convince me of the least impropriety in my con∣duct, I will amend
it immediately.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Sir,' said the vicar, 'it is handsomely
said; and, after this declaration, I will not believe you the man you have
been represented to me. You a murderer!'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'A murderer!' echoed Standfast, 'I abhor the
idea.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'I dare say you do sir,' cried the vicar,
'and yet the wicked world says you killed a man in a duel.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Oh is that all!' said Standfast, 'I was
com∣pelled to it. Poor Ned—he was a worthy fellow— 
<PB N="51" REF="84"/> I had a great regard for him, but he would insist upon
it, so I ran him through the body.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Mercy on us,' cried the vicar, 'and do you feel
no remorse for having the blood of a fellow creature upon your head?'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Not in an affair of honour,' said
Standfast. It was impossible to be avoided.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Honour!' cried the vicar with great vehe∣mence,
'it is a prostitution of the word. Can it be honour, because a man has
perhaps unwittingly affronted me, to shed his blood, and desolate his
family? Is it honour, because there are men of desperate fortunes, with
whom it is safer to face a pistol than a halter that I must either fear
to de∣tect their villany, or put my life upon a footing with theirs.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Spoken like an oracle, my dear sir,' said
Stand∣fast, 'but it will sometimes unavoidably happen that two men of
perfect honour, who wish one another extremely well, shall suddenly
dispute, till, grown warm, one or the other shall use an opprobious
epithet, which his friend cannot brook. What is to be done?—the man
must be knocked down you know.'</Q></P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="85"/> 
<Q REND="inline">'Knocked down!' hollowed the vicar, 'and so
make the breach too wide for all possibility of re∣paration. No sir, the
highest courage is to pity passion, not take advantage of it. Convince a
man into a concession, and your triumph is doubly noble. Why should a
fally of passion be sooner resented than the sally of a madman?
Besides, ac∣cording to your own rules, not to speak of its wickedness,
can any thing be so silly as duelling? A man receives an injury: what is
the satisfaction he asks? why truly he invites the aggressor in terms
of perfect politeness, to meet him at a cer∣tain time, where he requests,
as an attonement for the wrong, that his adversary may exert all his skill
to take away his life.'</Q></P>
<P>The vicar, who had now drank two glasses, made the above
declaration with uncommon vehemence. Standfast, in a pretended rapture
embraced him, confessed he was become his convert, and filling the
glasses for the third time, gave the major for a toast.</P>
<P>This the vicar could not avoid drinking. He de∣termined however
it should be the last; three glasses being at any time his utmost
stint. He had scarcely drank when, whether it was owing to the <HI>goute de
la terreinne,</HI> or being warm upon the subject, or what I shall not now
take upon me to say, but cer∣tainly <PB N="53" REF="86"/> he gave manifest
signs of being disordered from top to toe. His eyes sparkled, his head
be∣came dizzy, and his chair was of the same use to him as a pole is to a
rope-dancer; for, without it, he assuredly would have tumbled down. Nor
could he help testifying some applause at the end of a little
<HI>chansonette,</HI> which Standfast had been negligently singing. At
this the latter declared, with a violent oath, that he was the heartiest
companion he ever knew.</P>
<P>The vicar blamed him severely for swearing, but, stamping
his foot to enforce the rebuke, he trod upon the leg of a dog that lay before
the fire. The cur having received a private intimation from his master, flew
at the vicar, who, with great difficulty, and an exclamation of 
<Q REND="inline">'damn the dog,'</Q> got out of his way.</P>
<P>Standfast now fell foul of the vicar; telling him that he
might plainly see there were provocations that might induce a man to swear;
that the words themselves were no more than other words; and that men used
indiscriminately God bless you, and its opposite expression, when
neither a benediction nor a curse was in their hearts: which he was sure
was the case in relation to the vicar, as the excla∣mation 
<PB N="54" REF="87"/> against the dog was certainly uttered with∣out the
smallest premeditated malice.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Oh sir,' said poor Mildman, whose
speech now became affected, 'I would not wish the destruction of the
smallest reptile. As to the poor dumb creature, what he did was natural. I
trod upon him, and he flew at me: I did him an injury, and he resented
it.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Just my case,' said Standfast, 'in the
affair of the duel.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Oh no,' cried the vicar; as to the
duel—the duel—you see in relation to the duel—a man that is
intoxicated with passion—'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'is as bad,' inter∣rupted Standfast, 'as a man
intoxicated with liquor.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Oh yes,' cried the vicar, 'that is another
ter∣rible evil. When a man is drunk, he feels—that is the liquor mounts
to his head—and if the gid∣diness—which is the effect
of—what is the mat∣ter with me—I—but it is no such
thing—it is—im—im—impossible that—Oh dear
me—'</Q></P>
<P>Poor Mildman, sinking back in his chair, now fell fast
asleep; which Standfast no sooner saw, than he ordered in two sturdy
fellows, who were at <PB N="55" REF="88"/> hand, and bid them lay the vicar in a
certain field, where some of his flock would be sure to find him.</P>
<P>This was all that Standfast really meant; for, be∣ing a
perfect school boy at a frolic, and having long indulged a desire of
touching the vicar on the side of his sobriety, upon hearing of his coming
to con∣sult with him, he had infused a few grains of crude opium into a
bottle of port, which caused that <HI>goute de la terreine</HI> the vicar
complained of, and so acted both upon his head and his unsuspicious
temper as, at the third glass, to throw him into a complete state of
intoxication.</P>
<P>This deception I should have imparted at the be∣ginning of
this chapter, but for my constant obser∣vance of that necessary
etiquette which I hinted to my readers in the beginning of the last.</P>
<P>The two fellows, however, who carried out the vicar, were not
so easily contented. To get the par∣son completely into their clutches,
was such a tri∣umph, that they were determined to make the most of it. They
therefore stript him of his coat, put him on an old jerkin, patched with a
hundred different colours, set him in the middle of a field, upon a broken
chair, propt up by a few stakes, to prevent <PB N="56" REF="89"/> him from
falling, where he looked exactly like a figure placed to frighten the
crows.</P>
<P>Very fortunately for the poor vicar, the clerk and the
schoolmaster passed over the field a few minutes after the Hockley men
had left him. They were go∣ing to Little Hockley with a view to meet the good
man, and learn the success of his enterprize; and were scarcely within a
hundred yards of the supposed scarecrow when they saw it move of
itself, as it ap∣peared, for there was not a breath of wind stirring. Upon
this, looking with more attention, it got upon its legs, staggered two or
three paces, and fell down.</P>
<P>Perfectly convinced it must be a human being, they went up to
it; but what words can describe their astonishment when they heard the
voice and beheld the features of the vicar.</P>
<P>The two men who had stood aloof now made their appearance.
They were soon afterwards joined by almost half the village, who, seeing
the vicar in the hands of his friends, began to open upon them.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Fine doings indeed,' said one; 'ay, ay, the
still sow sucks all the grains.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Yes, yes,' cried another, 'there be black
sheep at Castlewick as well <PB N="57" REF="90"/> as at other places.'</Q>
The clerk and schoolmaster retorted, that they were sure some trick had
been played.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Odd rot it,' said a third, 'a reare trick to
be sure. Here must your parson cum to zee our parson, and nothing would
zarve un, as he zed, but bleeding the zellers, and zo you do zee, after he had
got mean drunk, we took and geed un an airing in our veeld, to fright away the
crows.'—</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Odds wounds,' cried another, 'your drunken
parson makes a mortal good scarecrow!'</Q> at which they all set up a
horse laugh.</P>
<P>The clerk and the schoolmaster having asked the vicar
several questions, and found, from his utter incapacity to give a rational
answer, they stood very little chance of knowing the truth—for as to
a single tittle to his prejudice, nothing could induce them to credit
it—they contented themselves with de∣manding his coat, hat, and wig,
which were pe∣remptorily refused; the ringleader swearing they should be
put upon a figure of the vicar, and that very night burnt in effigy.</P>
<P>Seeing that all their attempts to recover these spoils were
in vain, their next care was how to get <PB N="58" REF="91"/> home their charge,
when, fortunately, a tilted cart happening to go by, they called the driver,
who knowing them, with great readiness assisted to con∣vey the vicar to
his vehicle, heartily concerned at his deplorable condition, and vowing revenge
against those who had reduced him to it.</P>
<P>The cart set off one way, and the crowd another, shouting in
triumph as they bore away their tro∣phies, and swearing to exhibit them upon
a pile of faggots as soon as it should be dark.</P>
<P>Whether they did so or not will be known here∣after; but not
in the next chapter, that being ap∣propriated for another subject. Besides,
the reader may wish to be released for a time from the brutes of Little
Hockley. Nay it is not impossible but he may, in some small degree,
revolt at these latter circumstances. What a shocking indignity to make
so amiable a man drunk, let him swear, and after∣wards introduce him as a
scarecrow!</P>
<P>To these objections—for I own I am myself shocked at
the facts—I must beg to plead that I am only the historian of these
transactions; but, if I were the inventor, I really think that they are the
very cunning of the scene; for the more attrocious <PB N="59" REF="92"/> the
Hockley men appear, the more lustre will be thrown round the worthies of
Castlewick.</P>
<P>As for the swearing, I own I had some idea of smothering
it, but I will prove beyond contra∣diction that it is natural even in the
excellent Mr. Mildman.</P>
<P>The reader cannot wish for a more truly moral character to
illustrate the position than Doctor JOHNSON. This great man, we are told by
Mr. BOSWEL, while on his tour once made use of the words 
<Q REND="inline">"what the devil:"</Q>—I forget whether it
was on that evening the young lady sat upon his knee, for then there would
have been no great improba∣bility in his feeling the gentleman he mentioned a
little busy:—but he hastily recalled himself, and corrected his
expression.</P>
<P>Now 
<Q REND="inline">"what the devil,"</Q> from Dr. JOHNSON,
perfectly sober, I insist upon it, is about upon a par with 
<Q REND="inline">"damn the dog"</Q> from Mr. Mildman, drunk; for
drunkenness has the same effect upon the spirits, whether we fall into it
by accident or design. Nay drugs and charms may very likely create a
stronger delirium, and I have no manner of doubt but that if Dr. JOHNSON
could that evening have been prevailed upon to drink fermented liquor, 
<PB N="60" REF="93"/> it is within bare possibility—for I contend for
no more—that he might have whispered to his friend BOSWELL that the
lady was a damned fine girl, or some such buckishness.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER IX.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>SHEWING WHO ARE THE PROPER CONFIDENTS IN CASES OF LOVE.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>STANDFAST, as soon as he understood what had been done with
the vicar, appeared well enough sa∣tisfied, though he did not fail to declare
that the matter had been carried a great deal too far. How∣ever, at the major's
in the evening he gave the story in all its perfection; enlarging a little
indeed on one article, which was in saying that the vicar drank like a
fish:— 
<Q REND="inline">'but,' said he, looking very earnestly at
Mrs. Malplaquet, 'few virtues are so practicable as people would feign teach
us to believe. The detection of one hypocrite has in it merit enough to atone
for fifty sins openly committed. What say you major.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Why I say,' replied the major, 'that
hypocrisy is a low sin; a kind of rank and file vice; and ought to be
drumed out of every regiment of ho∣nest fellows. Don't you think so
chicken?' said he to his wife.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="95"/> 
<Q REND="inline">'Certainly I do,' said she, and as no man
alive has less of that meanest of vices than yourself, I may the more
freely utter my detestation of it.</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'You may be assured the worst of
hypocrites is he who covers his deceit with the practice of other vices. All
you can do with such a man is not to trust him too far: but how dreadful it
is to be al∣ways doubting a man you would wish to think well of. You will
say he keeps you a stranger to his hypocrisy, and leaves you almost
secure he is no such character, by openly avowing his other sins. This
very circumstance ought to excite your suspicion of his honesty; for
what does he see in one friend more than another, unless per∣haps to make
him his dupe.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'This may be all very true, madam,' said
Stand∣fast, 'but I must say it appears to me to be a very uncharitable
kind of judgment: I hope there are no such persons as you
describe.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'I am sure sir I should be as willing to
hope so as you,' said the lady, 'but I cannot give myself that
indulgence; for, uncharitable as it may be, I still insist that there is
one such character at least in the world.'</Q></P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="96"/> 
<Q REND="inline">'Come, come, I hope not,' said the major, 'if
it were only for the honour of the corps of human nature.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Well,' said the lady, 'since it has gone
so far, I beg that I may have leave to prove what I ad∣vance, merely to clear
myself from Mr. Standfast's imputation of uncharitableness.</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'I will suppose a case: A gentleman
shall be in your house, as Mr. Standfast is; receive your protection,
countenance, and friendship; and, in the moment you are heaping benefits upon
him—in full assurance that you count every thing upon his
gratitude—shall harbour dishonourable designs against your wife;
shall eternally teaze her when she is alone; behave himself so
particular to her in company, that she is obliged to force that de∣portment
into constraint which she could wish should be cheerfulness; and, in
the mean time, she dreads to make her persecutions known, for fear of ill
consequences from the anger of her hus∣band. In what order of hypocrites
would you class this man? What would he deserve?'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Deserve!' cried the major, 'to be flogged
till every thread of hemp was worn off the cat o' nine <PB N="64" REF="97"/>
tails. But pray now chicken do you mean this as mere general conversation, or
is there any thing intended by it?'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Oh that is impossible,' said Standfast,
nudging her at the same time under the table.</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Perhaps not,' cried the lady, 'enjoying his
confusion; 'at any rate you have no objection to my making it known, I
hope.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'I—no—Oh no madam—I—not
the least'—and then recovering himself a little—'not the
smallest objection you may be assured.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Very well sir,' said Mrs. Malplaquet,
'since it is a matter of such perfect indifference to you, I will take an
opportunity when I am tete a tete with my husband, of endeavouring to shew
him his friends from his enemies. At present,' added she, 'I should be
obliged to you to ring the bell, it may recover you from your fright.'</Q></P>
<P>Standfast did as he was desired, the lady's woman made her
appearance, and she retired to her cham∣ber, saying, as she went out, 
<Q REND="inline">'adieu major; and for you Mr. Standfast, I
wish you this and every <PB N="65" REF="98"/> night as sweet a repose,
with all your virtues, as that of Mr. Mildman, with all his
hypocrisy.'</Q></P>
<P>The two gentlemen being left to themselves, a silence of a
few minutes ensued. At length the ma∣jor got up suddenly, and having shut
the door, and locked it, advanced to Standfast in a most deter∣mined
stride, and uttered, in as determined a tone, 
<Q REND="inline">'Look'e Sir—if I thought I harboured a
rascal in my house, I would not wait for a court martial—his
ears!—dam'me his ears should in two minutes be nailed against the
wall, in terrorum to all scoundrels who dared to come as spies into a
gen∣tleman's camp! That my wife meant something is evident; that she would
not run a risk of ex∣asperating me without cause is as evident; tell me,
therefore, what you know of the matter; for fire me, Mr. Standfast, but it
shall be explained.'</Q></P>
<P>Standfast, who had taken good time to sort his cards, began
now to consider how he should play his game; and knowing the major's
credulity to his strongest suit, after stipulating for a patient
hear∣ing, he thus began.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'You very well know, major, you are upwards of
seventy; whereas your lady is not more than twenty-five. She married you
against her will, <PB N="66" REF="99"/> out of mere filial piety; and I
sincerely believe has been as faultless in her conduct as she is
beau∣tiful in her person. You have often said our souls were congenial;
and, that though there were no consanguinity between us, nature made us
bro∣thers. Is it wonderful then I should admire what you do? When the
desertion of a recreant pin has displayed her spreading bosom,
bursting like a lily from its pod, or a friendly stile betrayed her taper
leg to my view, I will not deny but it has fired my imagination, and in the
sweet mad∣ness of that delicious moment, I have been a
ras∣cal!—have loved your wife!—have told her of
it!—</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Oh major! you do not know what it is to
che∣rish a hopeless passion: you are happy: you pos∣sess the
object of your wishes, while I pine in de∣spair.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'In despair! ay, and so you ought,' cried
the major; 'what the devil would the man have? Han't you my friendship, my
credit, my purse?'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'None of which I deserve,' said
Standfast.</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Why no I think not indeed,' returned the
ma∣jor, 'if you cannot be content without my wife into <PB N="67" REF="100"/>
the bargain. No, no, I chuse, if you please sir, to have her affections
to myself.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Come, come,' said Standfast, 'major that is
too much; you know she did not marry you for love. She may have a
friendship for you, but assure your∣self no affection at her age for a
man of yours.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Why,' grumbled the major, 'there may be
something in that, but still sir that is nothing to you.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'It is so far something to me,' said
Standfast, 'that it serves me to exculpate myself; for if she had loved
you, I would sooner have cut my tongue out of my mouth than have suffered
it even to have whispered my passion. But you see how very excuseable
I am: Younger than you by al∣most twenty years, versed all my life in the
arts of pleasing women, and you know very well how many I have spared you
in the charming days of our youth.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Well, well,' said the major, 'that I do'nt
pre∣tend to deny.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Many a delicious girl,' returned Standfast, 
<PB N="68" REF="101"/> 'that doted on me have I torn from my own arms to
present to my friend.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'So you have—so you have'—said
the major.</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'And what thanks you gave me for it!' said
Standfast. Don't you remember the little auburn haired wench at
Ghent?'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'What the counsellor's wise?' cried the
major. 'She was a charming woman, by my faith. Come give me some wine. I
wonder what is become of her?'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'I don't know,' said Standfast; 'but major
nei∣ther you nor I boggled at her being married, that I recollect.</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'True, true,' cried the major,' but that you
know was a different affair.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'It was indeed,' returned Standfast, 'for I
insist upon it I shewed myself, in that instance, capable of a more
exalted friendship than you are; for I loved her, possessed her, and
yet gave her up to you: deprived myself of a sweet felicity to oblige my
friend. Ah major you never got the start of <PB N="69" REF="102"/> me but in
this last business. How different things used to be. The gayest, the
most accomplished yielded to me in the art of pleasing, and till I was
satisfied none dared attempt to make a choice.—Now, a foolish woman,
who loves neither of us, is to sow dissention between two friends, who
are all the world to each other.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Dam'me,' cried the major, 'but she shall
not; and if it was only a mistress, curse me if I don't think that tongue
of yours would prevail with me not to stand upon niceties: but you know,
Stand∣fast, as it is'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Oh,' cried the chaplain, 'however miserable I
may be, I will consume in silence rather than ut∣ter another
syllable.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Well that is friendly, said the major.
How∣ever,' returned the chaplain, 'I hope you will lay an injunction on Mrs.
Malplaquet to treat me with civility.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Oh you may depend upon that,' answered the
major.</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'And I think,' said Standfast, 'I may
venture <PB N="70" REF="103"/> to insist that I am not the hypocrite the
lady has thought proper to call me.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'I'll answer for that,' said the
major.</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'No, no,' repeated the chaplain, 'any
scoundrel if you please, Mrs. Malplaquet, but a hypocrite.'</Q></P>
<P>After this, upon asking the major if there was any remaining
animosity, his patron shook him heartily by the hand, and swore he
believed him to be the worthiest fellow upon earth; 
<Q REND="inline">'for where,' said he, 'is there another man
who, being in love with your wife, would have the honesty to con∣fess it to
your face?'</Q></P>
<P>Having brought this dialogue between tame cre∣dulity and
unblushing impudence to an end, I shall only add that this worthy
friendship seemed to be stronger cemented by what had passed.</P>
<P>The remainder of the conversation turned on their former
exploits, in which Standfast did not lose sight of the main point; but
enlarged wherever he could on the satisfaction he had always received in
administering to the major's pleasures.</P>
<P>At length the major was led off to bed in much 
<PB N="71" REF="104"/> about the same state of inebriety as the reader may
remember to have seen Mr. Mildman.</P>
<P>Before I take my leave of this chapter, I shall say a word
or two concerning Mrs. Malplaquet.</P>
<P>This lady, who was one of those living sacrifices which
avarice offers up at the shrine of interest, had, to say the truth, a
very difficult task to per∣form. Her parents, though sprung from an
ho∣nourable family, were of a younger branch, and, therefore, could give her
but a thousand pounds. The only man she ever loved had deserted her, for
a pert piece of deformity with just thirty times that sum. Thus, being
perfectly indifferent what be∣came of herself, she gave her hand, as the
good chaplain has already kindly noticed, to the major, out of perfect
obedience to her friends.</P>
<P>The life she had led since—the only pleasurable
moments of which were those she passed alone—may be easily
guessed. The audacious importunities of Standfast were much bolder than
either he or she had described; and he having repeated them in some way
that night so as extremely to offend her—though she was remarkable
for complacency and sweetness of temper—her anger had so far got
the better of her forbearance, as to force from her that <PB N="72" REF="105"/>
declaration of Standfast's dishonourable intentions, which the reader has
already seen he contrived, by the power he had over his patron, so to
palliate as to leave her the object of resentment rather than him.</P>
<P>I mention this for fear Mrs. Malplaquet, for whom I would wish
to interest the reader, should be wrong∣fully supposed to be one of
those outrageously vir∣tuous ladies who are eternally singing forth their
own praises, lest the world, from its natural uncha∣ritableness, should
unkindly imagine they are en∣titled to no praise at all:—a practice at
present in great and general credit. And really I do not see why it
should not; for who so proper to be the he∣rald of a man's merits as
himself? since he is surely competent to speak to his own motives, from
a thorough knowledge of whence they originate. And if he should turn the
best side outward, it ought to be considered as a meritorious expedient
to put him∣self upon a footing with his neighbour, and so pay him in his
own coin; appearance being as requisite to establish one sort of
reputation as paper to esta∣blish another; neither of which could
sustain any so∣lid credit without such assistance: for honour is
a commerce as well as business, and such ideal re∣sources often prevent
bankruptcies in both.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>CONTAINING TWO NEW CHARACTERS—PERFECTLY ORIGI∣NAL.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE worthy curate, in his way home, exulting at this new
instance of his influence over the major, ut∣tered, or rather I believe
reflected, the following so∣liloquy.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Zounds what an escape!—but it is
nothing to a genius like mine. Poor dolt, how gloriously I ride him! As to
madam, I fancy she'll tell no more tales. This is reducing things to a
system: but I always said it. To palliate an accusation, if you take a
man by that foible his generosity, you are sure to be safe. Men are
always liberal when there is nothing required but words.</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'But to expedients. This woman is a fool: I had
a scheme to her advantage. Her husband cannot live long, especially as I
drench him, and would she join me, we might make a comfortable thing on't
when once I should have preached his funeral sermon. Well, if she will
kick down her <PB N="74" REF="107"/> basket of glass ware, that is her
business. I will try her however once more. I am secure from any
impertinent tattling. The major will hear no more complaints. If she comes
to, I shall be charmed; for, to say the truth, she is a lovely wo∣man: if
not, shall I stake my interest against her folly? No, not were she a
Venus.</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'To-morrow I will begin the attack, and if she
should not capitulate in a week, I will then appear to raise the siege;
but it shall be only to prepare a mine, which, when once sprung, shall
either de∣stroy her, or make her prisoner at the mercy of her conqueror: in
which case she will not find in me the continence of POMPEY or
ALEXANDER.—No, no, my business is to talk of virtue; let fools
practise it, who are content to take it for their re∣ward.'</Q></P>
<P>Whether all or any part of Standfast's plan was put in
execution will hereafter be seen. When he came to the above period, he had
just finished his meditation and his walk, and having knocked at his door,
was let in by his confidential servant, who beat Scrub out of sight, in
point of variety in his employments; for as Scrub had one employment for every
day in the week, Mr. Flush—for that was his name—had one for
almost every day in the year. <PB N="75" REF="108"/> Nor, to say the truth,
was there ever any person better cut out for a great man's appendage, for I
hope the reader already allows Mr. Standfast to be a great man; and as to Mr.
Flush, or Mr. Kiddy Flush—for he had also a nick name—if a
fork be ne∣cessary to a knife, fuel to a fire, a scabbard to a sword, a
bucket to a well, a bailiff to an attorney, or a bully to a bawd, the
services of that faithful ad∣herent were essentially material and
absolutely ne∣cessary to his worthy principal: nay I question if Kiddy
was not very near, if not altogether as great an original as his master.</P>
<P>As, however, my opinion is of very little conse∣quence if my
good reader does not coincide with it, I think it absolutely incumbent on me
to delineate the portrait of the said Flush, or Kiddy—for he was as
often called one as the other—so let the claim to superiority rest
either on the side of the man or mas∣ter, as it shall appear by the
drawing; and as it is usual in portraits to illustrate the character by
some cymbolical ornament, through the means of which you can lay your finger
on the canvas and say this is a general, for he has a truncheon in his hand,
and this a butcher, for he has a nosegay in his bosom, so will I give the
like infallible traits to know the characteristic marks of Kiddy's most
striking qua∣lities.</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="109"/> As to his person, it was, for his
size—for he was only four feet eleven inches high—the most
compact that ever was seen; but then, as if nature had been fearful, had
she finished the front of this well pro∣portioned structure equal to the
rest of the work, lest she should have been tempted to have thrown down
her tools in despair, his face was the most sin∣gular piece of deformity
that can be conceived.</P>
<P>His nose and chin, like the head and tail of a weathercock,
pointed different ways; yet not east and west, nor north and south, but
to the zenith and nadir.</P>
<P>Some were of opinion that he had no mouth when he was born, but
that the operator had made an incision to serve for one; and that being in
a hurry, and his scissors none of the sharpest, he had not only cut
it in an oblique direction, from the right side of the under jaw up to the
left cheek bone, but also zig zag; so that when he laughed—indeed
laugh he never did—but when he grinned—for his teeth were pretty
even, which lends probability to the business of the incision—</P>
<P>But pray excuse me from relating how he looked when he
grinned, till I have described his eyes; one of which, the left, was
smaller than the other, and <PB N="77" REF="110"/> whether it envied the
superior size of its neighbour, or was awed by conscious humility at its
own insig∣nificance, I really cannot say, but it fairly slunk into the
opposite corner, without even deigning, or perhaps daring, to cast one
single glance to the right, while the other, in triumphant pride, rolled, or
ra∣ther goggled about, and appeared itself an Argus, looking a hundred ways
at once.</P>
<P>To these unlovely marks—which in females are called
certificates for their honesty—I must add that Kiddy was frightfully
seamed with the small pox, and that he received no addition in point of
beauty from an explosion of gunpowder when he was abroad, which stript the
skin off his face, except on a small part of one of his cheeks, and one or
two other places; and thereby left such a violent redness for ever after,
that his face looked something like a rump steak, or rather like red ochre
in the grinding, in which, if you take up the muller, you may see an
appearance like branches of trees, which answers exactly to seams of the
small pox; or, to add one more simile, which shall take in beard and
all—for his beard, like that of Hudibras, was orange tawny—his
complexion was like a red wine syllabub, where here and there appears a
splotch of white curd, the whole gently tinged with a sprinkling of
nutmeg.</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="111"/> As to the grinning, after I have said
so much, I think I should affront the reader by describing it. He knows
every feature now as well as I do, and if he chuses to call up a grin in his
imagination, and when he has so done, does not grin himself, I can only
say he is not the reader I took him for.</P>
<P>Kiddy Flush had been employed from his youth up to beat the
drum, distribute the bills, and slang the figures of a puppet shew, where
he had learnt a smattering of every thing. He could scrape the fid∣dle,
vault on the slack wire, swear a good round hand, coax the girls, get
boozy, and I am afraid thieve; for if he had not this last qualification, I
cannot see why they should send him hand-cuffed, which they really did,
on board a transport whose destination was to the American
plantations.</P>
<P>In short, not to conceal the disgrace, Kiddy was certainly
transported to America; from whence he contrived to get re-transported to
Ireland. There he found means to get engaged as a drummer in the same
regiment where Standfast was chaplain. In∣deed Kiddy Flush was the very
person who taught Tiger Standfast to beat that reveille, which has been
already celebrated as a <HI>chef d'oeuvre.</HI></P>
<P>Were I to run through all the scenes so full of 
<PB N="79" REF="112"/> srolic, whim, dissipation, and singular
dissoluteness, which were practised by this trim tram, this horse and
his rider, I might as well at once have given the world the adventures of Tiger
Standfast and his man Kiddy; but as that is not totally my intention, I
shall content myself with noticing that these worthy associates,
finding themselves very necessary to each other, a league was entered
into between them, that mutual assistance should be given—to put
the matter a little technically—in all breezes, frisks, plots,
queerings, tricks, humbugs, and bambouzlings, that they might find it expedient
to engage in; that the agreement should be understood as a partnership
between them, with this sole distinction, that Flush should be openly
considered as a servant, and in that character be kept in subordination
before company, but permitted to speak his mind freely, openly, and without
reserve when nobody should be present.</P>
<P>Kiddy Flush, at the time of his first introduction to the
reader—for nothing is so advantageous as to bring on your principal
characters with a good grace,—was what is called half gone; in his own
language a little cockish: for I must tell the reader—and that is
really the last explanation I will trouble him with about Kiddy—that,
among the rest of his oddities, his choice of words was the most
singular. It was composed of the cant terms of both his professions, 
<PB N="80" REF="113"/> to which he occasionally added a miserable pun, and
now and then a little bad French, which he had picked up on his travels; the
whole interlarded with new-fangled oaths.</P>
<P>Kiddy had just been witness to a curious scene in the
village, and was bursting to disclose it to his master on his arrival.
At the same time it must be remembered that Standfast's head was entirely
filled with what had passed at the major's.</P>
<P>Kiddy then scarcely suffered his master to sit down
before he began with 
<Q REND="inline">'I say master, there has been rum gig going
forward this evening.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Gig, what do you mean?' said Standfast:</Q>
his mind still running on his late adventure. 
<Q REND="inline">'Nay nothing,' said Flush, 'no rang, only we
had like to have come off with tats, that's all. Shiver me if we had not been
cute, we should some of us have taken a leap without nobody to hold the
blanket.'</Q></P>
<P>Standfast thinking he alluded to the scrape he had so
narrowly got out of, replied, 
<Q REND="inline">'why how the devil came you to know any thing
about it?'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Why Lord love you,' said Kiddy, 'I know the
whole manoeuvre of the thing, and I must say it was bunglingly
managed.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Bunglingly!' said Stand∣fast; 'dam'me if I
think any man in the world <PB N="81" REF="114"/> ever drew himself out of
such a hobble with half so much grace. To have them both upon me, the old
soldier and his wife!'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Why master, what are you upon?' said
Flush. 'The jonse I means ben't no old soldiers, nor their wives; but a
parcel of sheep biting poltroons—flats—mazards—who,
instead of pelting it out like hearties, sneaked away to the boozing
cases, and left the enemy masters of the champ of battle.'</Q></P>
<P>He here acquainted Standfast that, at the moment of exhibiting
the effigy of the vicar on its funeral pile, a party of heroes from
Castlewick, who had heard from the clerk and the schoolmaster of the
in∣dignity intended to be offered to their worthy pastor, rushed in,
saved those precious relics from the flames, and bore them off in triumph;
while the affrighted Hockleymen fled amazed, scarcely offer∣ing to
resist:—and it was well they did, for the vi∣car's adherents would
have died on the spot rather than have yielded.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'However,' said Flush, 'for the honour of
the cause I rallied the scums, and spoke a speech to them, as near as I
can remember, in these um here words.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="115"/> 
<Q REND="inline">'Says I—Splinter your joints, what are you
about? Will you, after this, pretend to call your∣selves hearty culls, rum
codgers, or valiant dickies? You lump the Castlewickites!—you be
damned. Don't you see the queer kids have made off with the toggies! But,
however, this here I will say—you had no maulers, and they took you by
surprize. Don't be down hearted then. To day is for them: to-morrow may be
for us. Kal∣lenge them nolens volens to the field: fifty against fifty, like
worthies. Thump it out kindly; and then if you lose, why you die like cocks,
and we will sing tiddium over your graves. What say you my good master to
my horation? Was it not great, high, and crackish?'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Oh very great indeed, General Flush,'
returned Standfast. 'What effect had it?'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Effect!' ex∣claimed Flush, 'Dam'me it took
like a train. In an hour the kallenge was sent, a categorical re∣turned, and
to-morrow at five we beat to arms.</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Bravo!' cried Standfast; 'but remember I know
nothing of this. Stay, a thought strikes me: I can make this matter of use:
my pretty piece of temptation yonder is squeamish: I will think on't: but
it is late. Good night Flush:—<PB N="83" REF="116"/> hearten your
soldiers, and don't forget that I must be a stranger to the whole
business.'</Q></P>
<P>The master and man here parted; the one went to snooze, as
he called it, and the other to meditate how he could make this accident of
advantage to him.</P>
<P>In this situation, if the reader please, we will leave them,
and return to the major's, late as it is; as I am anxious to make known what
passed in the mind of Mrs. Malplaquet, after she retired to her
appart∣ment.</P>
<P>That lady had a most faithful and honest friend in her
handmaid Emma, who was almost as singular a character as Flush, though a
perfect contrast, for nothing in nature could be more harmless.</P>
<P>Emma was the daughter of a bookseller in Lon∣don, who having a
large family, and being in no very flourishing circumstances, was prevailed
on to put her out as a lady's companion. An advantage∣ous recommendation
brought her into the care of Mrs. Malplaquet, where she had been now retained
for almost three years; in which time she had made herself so
necessary and so agreeable to her lady, that <PB N="84" REF="117"/>
nothing I believe could have prevailed on her to part with so valuable an
acquisition.</P>
<P>What made her company so particularly desir∣able, was the
astonishing fund of information she had treasured up, by sitting in
her father's shop. Her mind was a kind of circulating library in little, and
I sincerely wish romances were always attended with the same good effects
they produced in her; for there is scarcely a good moral inculcated by them
that she did not act up to. Not that she had not formed a decided opinion
of writings as well as writers; but she rarely broached that opinion,
think∣ing with Madam DACIER that silence was the best ornament of the
female sex. It was evident, how∣ever, that it was wisely and judiciously
chosen, for at the head of her favourite authors she placed Dr. JOHNSON;
though I rather think her great admira∣tion of him must have been as a
critic, for the Doc∣tor is known to have entertained a rooted dislike to
mythology, and indeed every figurative writing which does not square with
what he calls truth and morality; whereas Emma maintained that morality being
the noblest drift of literature, those writings were the most perfect
which brought virtue into dan∣ger, that she might rise the more triumphant;
and that such productions received an additional force and beauty from
allegory and mythological allusion.</P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="118"/> The various merits of our literary Abigail
will gradually unfold themselves as we go on. I thought it necessary to
say so much, to account for Mrs. Mal∣plaquet's determination of
disclosing to her the bu∣siness of Standfast's audacity, and to
advise with her what steps she should take.</P>
<P>Emma heard the whole affair with great delibe∣ration, and,
pausing for some moments, her lady asked her of what she was
considering?</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'I am looking, madam,' said she, 'over the
ca∣talogue of my mind, to see if I have ever read any thing like it, and,
upon recollection, the same thing occurs in the Nonjuror, one of CIBBER's
plays; which is taken from the Tartuffe of MO∣LIERE; who had it I believe from
PLAUTUS:—and if I might advise, you should serve your parson as
the lady in that play does hers.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'How is that?' said Mrs. Malplaquet, 'for I
re∣ally forget.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Why madam,' replied Emma, 'she pretends to be
caught in his snare, while she is laying one for him; and placing her
husband so as to over-hear a pretended love scene between them, his
villany is detected, and he is turned out of the house.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="86" REF="119"/> 
<Q REND="inline">'I like the idea,' said the lady 'of all
things in the world, and, with thy assistance am ready to set about it.
But how Emma if he should turn the tables upon us? for he is very
subtle.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'I know it very well madam,' said Emma, 'for
at this moment he is making as strong love to me as to yourself; but I
promise you he finds me a very Pamela.'</Q></P>
<P>The lady expressed some surprize at this intelli∣gence,
and asked her maid if she was not uneasy at it.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'On the contrary,' cried Emma, 'I am charm∣ed;
for to resist temptation is the proper exercise of virtue, and serves
as a kind of moral penance to strengthen us in our duty. Oh I assure you
madam you need not be uneasy: one look from virtue, though a lamb, will as
surely make vice crouch, as the lion did at the sight of Una.'</Q></P>
<P>By this time Mrs. Malplaquet was undrest, and soon after her
maid retired; which opportunity I shall seize to account for my having
given two such subordinate characters as Flush and Emma so parti∣cular
an introduction.</P>
<P>To say the truth then, I think that, though the 
<PB N="87" REF="120"/> clown should say no more than is set down for him,
yet he should say all that is set down for him. The devil has been
considered by some as the principal character in Paradise Lost. Comus
on all hands is allowed to have the better of the lady. Will any one pretend to
say Don Quixote would be any thing without Sancho. In all the Spanish plays
the ser∣vants are the principal characters, and I have heard the soldier in
WEST's General Wolfe spoken of as the best figure in the groupe. Emma would
have de∣fended this argument by saying that Honor is drawn in as masterly a
style as Sophia; and Flush would have told you that both man and master
were human puppets, moved by the same slangs. In short, I write for all
readers, and I hope I have scarcely a character but some one or other will
pitch upon for my hero.</P>

<PB REF="121"/>
<HEAD>CHAPTER XI.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>IN WHICH THE HISTORIAN FULFILS HIS PROMISE TO THE READER.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE challenge from the Hockleymen having been, as Mr. Flush
informed us, accepted by the Castle∣wickites, a large plain, known by the
name of the cricket green, situated near the high road, about midway between
the two villages, was pitched upon for the scene of action. Thither repaired
the com∣batants; and there were they drawn up in battle ar∣ray, every man
poising his hedgestake, when a gen∣tleman in a post chaise and four,
who had ordered the postilion to mend his pace, when he first saw a mob
assembled, came up, and cried out in a pretty authoritative voice, that if
the inhabitants of Castle∣wick did not desist, they should lose his
favour for ever.</P>
<P>The Castlewickites expected a very different word of command.
Finding however their present ge∣neral to be no other than Sir Sidney, they
thought proper to throw down what Mr. Flush called mau∣lers. Upon this the
Hockley men began to spring <PB N="89" REF="122"/> forward with an exulting
shout and would have dealt death among their unarmed enemies had not another
authoritative voice commanded a suspension of hostilities on their
part.</P>
<P>This voice proceeded from no less a person than Mr. Flush,
who having deliberately weighed the probable consequence of such violent
proceedings, began to think they would not be altogether so con∣sistent
with prudence. He considered that the quar∣rel had originated with
Standfast, and that there would be enough to do, without this new outrage, to
set matters to rights about the vicar. It was therefore his business, in
quality of his master's friend—by means of which he knew he should be
also his own—to soften matters; and having an ex∣cellent opportunity,
owing to this piece of cowar∣dice on the part of his adherents, he holloed out,
as loud as his shrill pipe would permit him—</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Why, pink your livers, what are going for to
do? Would ye, stiffen your timbers, go for to be such poltroons as to
brush the jackets of a parcel of naked men! Don't you see they have canted
away their whackers?'</Q></P>
<P>Then speaking in a lower tone to his lieutenant
general—said he 
<Q REND="inline">'The shew is over, we must let 
<PB N="90" REF="123"/> down the rug: so do you parley to the hearties, while I
palaver the old rum kid yonder.'</Q></P>
<P>Upon this he came up to Sir Sidney, and was be∣ginning to
state the case in a very advantageous way to his master and himself,
when their attention was drawn off by a violent screaming at a short
distance. Directing their eyes to where the sound proceeded from, they
saw a coach overturned, to which Sir Sidney ran, and was indeed followed by
the whole mob, friends and enemies.</P>
<P>The coach belonged to Major Malplaquet, and there were in it, at
the time of this accident, that gentleman, his lady, and the reverend Mr.
Standfast. Neither the lady nor the curate received any mate∣rial injury, but
the major's head had pitched against a ragged stone, by which means his
skull was dan∣gerously fractured.</P>
<P>The combatants, their cause of quarrel, and every other
consideration was now absorbed in this me∣lancholy accident.</P>
<P>The major was with difficulty listed into his coach, where Sir
Sidney, who had never seen him before, offered to accompany him; recommending
his chaise to Mrs. Malplaquet, into which Mr. <PB N="91" REF="124"/>
Standfast very politely offered to accompany her, with a view, as he said,
of keeping up her spirits.</P>
<P>The lady however thought proper to refuse both offers, and
insisted upon going with her husband. She, however, did not neglect to
thank Sir Sidney with tears for his kind concern, which indeed was as
manifest as if the wounded person had been his own brother; for he had by
this time dispatched three servants to different surgeons. Not but Mr.
Standfast appeared in some concern too, but the glances he cast at the
lady, and the opera tune he softly whistled while he assisted his
dying patron, pretty well evinced that his mind ran rather upon the future than
the present.</P>
<P>Sir Sidney would not leave the major a moment, but supported
him in the coach with the utmost care and tenderness all the way home,
where by the time they arrived, and the major was put to bed, arrived also
two of the surgeons, who agreed that the ma∣jor had not many hours to live.
They however bled him, prepared bandages, and one of them be∣gan to prepare for
the operation of the trepan: re∣solved that their patient should go out of
the world <HI>secundum artem.</HI> They were, however, disappoint∣ed; for
falling into a delirium, he erupted a blood <PB N="92" REF="125"/>
vessel—which one of the surgeons very judiciously observed
must have been injured by the fall—and was instantly
suffocated.</P>
<P>Mrs. Malplaquet did not faint away, nor even go into
hysterics, upon this occasion: she felt however very severely. It is
true her tears did not prevent her from thanking Sir Sidney; on the contrary
she acknowledged his singular goodness in terms of the most lively
gratitude; yet her grief, though it ap∣peared only decent and proper, was from
the heart. She, no more than the vicar, would have wished the destruction
of the vilest reptile; and though she never regarded the major with the
ardour of love, yet he had ever been kind, and she grateful.</P>
<P>I shall pass over the funeral, at which Sir Sidney, by a
particular invitation from Mrs. Malplaquet, was present, and only say that
when all proper ce∣remonies and decent solemnities were over, the wi∣dow,
after paying some legacies—the principal of which was three thousand
pounds to the Reverend Mr. Standfast, as a trifling acknowledgment of his
disinterested and honourable attachment—for the chaplain had
frequently hinted that if a man left any thing to a friend, it had better be in
money, which would prevent litigation. The widow, I say, after 
<PB N="93" REF="126"/> discharging these obligations, found herself in the
possession of a plentiful fortune.</P>
<P>One circumstance, however, I must not fail to mention, which
is that Mr. Mildman, at the desire of Mrs. Malplaquet, preached the funeral
sermon. Nor can I avoid noticing that Sir Sidney furnished the epitaph,
which was no more than what follows: 
<Q> HERE are deposited the Remains of <LB/>MAJOR MALPLAQUET,
<LB/>Who feared his Maker, <LB/>Served his Country, <LB/>And left a grateful Widow
to lament his Death, <LB/>And celebrate his inferior Virtues. <LB/>He died March
the 1st, 1751. <LB/>Aged 71 Years.</Q></P>
<P>This epitaph Emma declared to be perfect in all its
requisites; for it told who was the person buried, and very concisely
pointed out his good qualities: you also learnt by it when he died, and how
old he was. Nay, so much was she pleased, that she doubted not, if it
had been written in latin, but that Dr. JOHNSON himself must have been
perfectly content with it. For her part, she liked it as well as it was; and
that for a very good reason, as she humbly conceived, namely, because
she did not un∣derstand <PB N="94" REF="127"/> latin. Indeed she owned
that this was one of the spots that candour obliged her to acknow∣ledge were
now and then to be discovered in the doctor. He was very angry that Dr.
SMOLLET's epitaph was not written in latin; and when he went into an
apothecary's shop with Mr. BOSWELL, in∣stead of asking for some
trifling medicine he had oc∣casion, for, he called for paper, pen, and ink,
and wrote it down in latin.</P>
<P>These manners and opinions she thought—for nobody was
so open to conviction as Emma—were upon erudition what rust is upon a
coin, which no one knows the value of but the possessor.</P>
<P>Nothing could be so clear, she said, as what she
advanced. It was not every body's lot to be blest with so much learning as
the doctor, which she maintained was very fortunate; for if all men were
arrived at such perfection as himself, and were able like him of advancing
incontrovertible <HI>ipse dixits,</HI> argument would be at an end, and of
course litera∣ture along with it. But, as he was the only one who had ever
pretended to be infallible, and who cer∣tainly was so, except in a few
trifling points like this, it might so happen that latin epitaphs would prove
a sarcasm where they were meant to be a pa∣negyric; for to praise a dead
person in a language <PB N="95" REF="128"/> he was unacquainted with while
living, though a tacit, would be a very strong satire; besides being a
cruel inconvenience to his family, who must, in this case, be obliged to
get the parson to construe the virtues of the deceased, who, after all,
perhaps might not be able to do it off hand. She therefore clearly apprehended,
that as Dr. JOHNSON had is∣sued a literary bill, enacting that an epitaph
could not be perfect which did not mention the particu∣lars before rehearsed,
the next infallible writer—if ever this country should be blest with
another, should be petitioned to move, by way of rider, that, for the benefit
of the public in general, all such epi∣taphs should be done in English. 
<Q REND="inline">'But,' said she, finishing her harrangue,
'dear Doctor JOHNSON put me in mind at last of DOMITIUS AFER, who would be an
orator when he could no longer be audible, and of whom QUINTILIAN said that
he would rather sail than desist.'</Q></P>
<P>It is now high time I should account for that strange jumble
of accidents which, in so short a time, saved an hundred men from bodily
hurt, and yet killed another, who had no concern at all in the fray.</P>
<P>The reader will recollect that Standfast had a scheme in
agitation. It was this: He knew Mrs. <PB N="96" REF="129"/> Malplaquet to be of
a most tender and compassionate temper, and he thought he could wound her
through this weak side. He had therefore lured the major and her out, by way
of an afternoon's ride, intend∣ing, when they arrived at the field of battle,
to ex∣claim against the barbarity of the disputants, to jump out of the
carriage, and to insist on their going peaceably home.</P>
<P>This he thought the lady would take in such a light as must
greatly forward his designs. The con∣templation of this scheme on his
side, and the hopes of detecting him on the side of Mrs. Malplaquet, made
them, on that afternoon, better satisfied with each other than they had been
a long time, and gave the major such real pleasure, that he declared, as
they were in the carriage, that he never passed so happy a day in his
life, without divining, poor man, that it would be his last.</P>
<P>Mr. Standfast's kind intentions were, however, forestalled
by Sir Sidney, who, through an unex∣pected dissolution of parliament, was
posting down to be rechosen for the borough of Neitherside.</P>
<P>Thus are men saved or destroyed by the turn of a straw.
Thus the villagers slept in whole skins: thus the major was hurried into
the other world: thus <PB N="97" REF="130"/> were the designs of Mr.
Standfast frustrated: and thus—for I cannot longer refrain from
declaring it—did Sir Sidney see that phantom we formerly spoke of:
that disturber of his peace, to whom he longed to open his mind.</P>
<P>This is the secret I hinted to the reader at the end of the
sixth chapter, and I only desire to be resolved, had I then divulged
it—and thereby have neglected to bring him acquainted with the
heartburnings of the two villages, the contrast between the two par∣sons,
the singular friendship of Standfast and the major, the amiable cast of
Mrs. Malplaquet, the ex∣traordinary qualities of her maid, the wonderful and
surprising talents of Mr. Flush, and every other person or thing that
conduced to bring about that event which introduced Sir Sidney to Mrs.
Malpla∣quet—whether it would not have been doing things in a bungling and
unworkmanlike manner?</P>
<P>Besides I have now no further trouble with these people; the
reader is perfectly acquainted with them, and if, in future, they should be
thrown in his way, let them speak for themselves.</P>
<P>To be sure had they never appeared at all, Sir Sidney might
have been heart-whole; but since a number of circumstances are likely to
grow out of <PB N="98" REF="131"/> this accidental interview, I have even given
it as it happened; and shall now tell the reader when time had fully
confirmed the baronet in his first opi∣nion of the widow, that she was a
very handsome, and, what was more to him, a very valuable wo∣man, he
resolved to throw his fortune into her lap, and his person into her arms:
and for this purpose he was determined to make her a proposal to that
effect as soon as decency should permit it.</P>
<P>Several reasons urged him to this: first, there was a
secret, which, to make amends for my late trans∣gression, shall be
almost immediately disclosed to the reader.</P>
<P>Perhaps my readiness to indulge him may be at∣tributed to
malevolence; because, in doing so, I shall be obliged to shew a speck
in the character of Sir Sidney, which to some may appear black, place it in
what light I will. To this accusation, however, I plead not guilty;
solemnly declaring, that, in the most unrighteous moments of his life, I
truly be∣lieve he had as reasonable a stock of piety as any bishop would
desire; as much temperance, sober∣ness, and chastity, even in his very
excesses, as a gouty alderman under a regimen; and, at any rate, as little
desire of doing an injury to man, woman, or child as a Lord Chancellor.</P>
<P><PB N="99" REF="132"/> This however need not hinder the reader
from exercising his own judgment, which I not only de∣sire he may do, but
also with the most critical care and nicety; and when all the
circumstances, dan∣gers, temptations, motives, and inducements, are clearly
and fairly examined, if he should not acquit Sir Sidney of every thing
worse than venial frailty, I must honestly take shame to myself for
having palmed on the world, as an exemplary character, a mere mortal, made up
of flesh and blood, and sub∣ject to wishes, inclinations, and desires,
like other men.</P>
<P>I could say certainly that the very excellence of Sir Sidney's
heart sprung from having as vigorous and turbulent passions as any rake
in christendom, and never having improperly given them the reins, but once,
in his life. But some of my readers may think that once too much. And as a
blot at back∣gammon is no blot till it is hit, and a blot of ink is the
easier discoverable in proportion to the whiteness of the paper on which
it falls; and as an atom is not only magnified, but more deformed, by being
seen through a microscope, so I fear this one fault will intrude itself
on the reader's remembrance, in the very act of relieving distressed
genius, or wiping a tear from the cheek of an orphan. If it should be 
<PB N="100" REF="133"/> so, I must submit; for a reader, like a pope, is
in∣fallible, and from his fiat there is no appeal.</P>
<P>The story of Sir Sidney's incontinence—for in∣continence
it was, and such things, like murder, will out—shall be told in the
next chapter, which will finish the first book of this history; and while
the reader takes time to consider what heinous crime this can possibly
be, let me bespeak his charity by informing him that Sir Sidney being once
foreman of a grand jury, whom the judge recommended to find a bill against a
murderer, because, as he said, such and such circumstances were,
which could not have been yet proved, answered with an honest
fer∣vour,— 
<Q REND="inline">'My Lord, in my opinion the pre-judgment of an
offence is half as criminal as the commission of it.'</Q></P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XII.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>WHICH CONTAINS THE TRIAL OF SIR SIDNEY—THE PLEAD∣INGS ON
BOTH SIDES—THE VERDICT AND SENTENCE—AND FINISHES THE FIRST BOOK OF
THIS HISTORY.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>WE are now going to enter upon action, every thing already
related having happened previous to the time when the reader and I entered the
rookery; or, as Mr. Bayes has it, long before the beginning of this play. We
there left Sir Sidney apparently possessed of every comfort upon earth,
and yet un∣happy. This seeming paradox has been partly ac∣counted for; but
let us hope, as Mrs. Malplaquet is now entirely mistress of herself, that
the bar to the completion of the baronet's wishes may be re∣moved.</P>
<P>The major has now been dead nearly a twelve-month, and Sir
Sidney has had many opportunities of confirming himself in the good opinion
he origi∣nally entertained of the widow; but as, at his time of life, marriage
was no maygame, he honestly so∣licited to be acquainted with every secret
of her <PB N="102" REF="135"/> heart, frankly offering to encourage her by
laying open the exact situation of his own.</P>
<P>Mrs. Malplaquet liked the proposal so well, that she did
not hesitate to give him every information concerning herself, which I
formerly gave the rea∣der; not forgetting to own, with an ingenuous
frankness, that she had loved before; and though, were she to form a
character, she knew of no qua∣lity she would wish to make a part of it
that Sir Sid∣ney did not perfectly possess, yet that warmth of af∣fection
which she had formerly cherished would ne∣ver again, she sincerely
believed, take place in her heart.</P>
<P>Sir Sidney scarcely heard her to an end, when he
exclaimed— 
<Q REND="inline">'Madam, in opening my own heart, I should have
used the very same words. I have loved, and will imitate you by
confessing that the object of my affection, whether alive or dead, is
still dear to me. Your resemblance of her first induced my admiration of
you, and the consonance of your sentiments with hers, inspired me with an
esteem of the truest kind, which perhaps, in marriage, more securely
ensures happiness than what is generally called love.</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'To conside in your tender bosom the
secret of <PB N="103" REF="136"/> my passion is now my duty, and if you
will have the patience to hear me, I shall shew you that those who are
capable of most tenderness, are effectively the least happy:—but,
as old AESOP said when Prometheus took the clay to form man, he tem∣pered it
with tears.'</Q></P>
<P>The lady testified great impatience, and the ba∣ronet
proceeded to satisfy her in the following words.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Being about ten years ago in the south of
France, I became acquainted with a gentleman of the name of Le Clerc. He had a
daughter, who, at the time I first visited in the family, was just come
home from a convent. Conversations between French and English too often
turn on the subject of religion. As to Mr. Le Clerc, he was not sa∣tisfied
with continually chanting forth the praises of that only and exclusive
worship, which, accord∣ing to him, would procure salvation, but he daily
exhorted me to embrace his faith.</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'This inconvenience I should have got rid of
by renouncing his acquaintance, or removing to ano∣ther town: but I had no
such power. I had spoken you may be assured warmly, though not like an
enthusiast, of our own mild, reasonable worship, <PB N="104" REF="137"/>
representing it as the true medium between fran∣tic zeal and subtle
hypocrisy; and though all my arguments served but to root the father's
opinion the stronger, I plainly began to perceive I had made a convert of the
daughter.</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'In the convent where she boarded lived also
se∣veral English ladies, who had already began to stagger her
sentiments:—no wonder then her con∣version was completed by the man
she loved. Yes madam, plain, downright, and sincere as I was, a beautiful
girl of nineteen, gentle as a che∣rub, and good as an angel, doated on me. Nor
was I behind hand with her, I promise you; for my affection was exactly of
that sort which receives its pleasure by reflecting what it has
given.</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'This was the charm that withheld me. We
consulted together on the most expedient means to gratify our mutual
wishes, and though I dreaded the event, it was resolved that I should
offer my∣self to her father as the husband of my dear An∣nette. I did so;
he heard me to an end, and then very explicitly informed me that he would
consent to my marriage with his daughter upon condition I changed my
religion.</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'I spoke of this as an unsurmountable
objection, <PB N="105" REF="138"/> when he candidly told me he saw how matters
were, and would immediately send his daughter to a severer convent, to
prevent her from throwing herself into the arms of a heretic.</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'I had scarcely returned to my lodgings, to
re∣flect on this adventure, and the measures I ought to take in consequence
of it, when my servant came running to tell me that a post chaise was
waiting at the door, with a lady in it, who desired to see me immediately.
Guess what was my sur∣prize when I beheld my Annette, who told me in as few
words as possible that her father was at that moment gone to the abbess
of a certain convent, to agree to her entire exclusion from the world; that
she had chosen the moment of his absence to come to me; and knowing how
much my mind was above the false delicacy of sacrificing to ridi∣culous
form and unnecessary ceremony, she pro∣posed at once going off for
some town where we might be married in the protestant faith.</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'You may be sure I did not hesitate, but
leaving my affairs to my faithful servant, whom I ordered to stay and watch
the motions of the enemy, I leaped into the chaise, and we were more than
twenty leagues on our road to Geneva, when poor <PB N="106" REF="139"/> Annette
was taken so very ill that it was impossible for us to proceed.</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'I was in hopes her indisposition had
proceeded from the fatigue, the hurry of her spirits, and those fears which
were natural upon having taken so precipitate a resolution: but I found
myself lamentably mistaken; her disorder encreased, and I was greatly
alarmed for her life. By degrees, however, she recovered, and though very
weak, we apprehended no more dangerous symptoms.</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'During all this time as we were thrown among a
parcel of boors, I was obliged to give her every attendance I decently could.
This attention pro∣cured so free and uninterrupted an intercourse be∣tween
us, that is it wonderful when the rose be∣gan to revisit her cheeks, and my
whole soul was in a trance of happiness at the prospect of retriev∣ing an
inestimable treasure that, a few days before, I had dreaded to lose for
ever:—Is it wonderful thus unrestrained, considering ourselves as
man and wife, we became so by every tie but the cere∣mony. I will not comment
on the circumstance: perhaps it was inexcusable: perhaps I ought not to
have disclosed it: but nothing could be purer than our intentions were, and
I have no opinion of secrets which are revealed after marriage.'</Q></P>
<P><PB N="107" REF="140"/> Mrs. Malplaquet—which I think was
very hand∣some in her—scarcely called it a fault, because of the
peculiarity of their situation, and their intention of setting matters
honourably to rights. Nay she undertook to defend the conduct of the lady; at
which Sir Sidney was so greatly charmed, that he sung forth very lavishly
in praise of the widow's ge∣nerosity, liberality, and candour; and declared
that, except now and then a sigh to the memory of An∣nette, he should never
have an intruding care.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Well madam,' returned the baronet, 'three weeks
passed in pleasures which it is not in my power to describe. At the end
of this time, my Annette having recovered sufficient strength to undergo
the fatigue of her journey, we set out for Geneva; but scarcely had we got
within a league and a half of those frontiers where, by exercising the
right of a husband, I could have silenced the pretensions of a father,
when being overtaken by a posse of horsemen, headed by Le Clerc, my
Annette was torn from me, while I was over∣powered, and carried before the
general of the police of the neighbouring town.</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'This gentleman heard my story to an end;
laughed at my folly for not getting sooner out of danger; took a handsome
present of me; and gave <PB N="108" REF="141"/> me a letter to the father of
Annette: advising him to make up the breach, by consenting to our
mar∣riage.</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'I scarcely gave myself time for sleep, or
any other refreshment, before I threw myself at the feet of Mr. Le Clerc. I
got nothing from him however but a volley of reproaches; to which I answered
that his daughter was affianced to me, that I considered her as my wife, and
would em∣ploy my whole fortune, as well as the interest of the English
embassador, who was my particular friend, to do myself justice.</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Every argument procured me a new insult; I
therefore went to Paris for the purpose of con∣sulting my friend, the
embassador; but, as we were then upon the eve of a war, and he expected
every moment to be recalled, it was out of his power to do me any
service.</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Thus disappointed, I returned once more to
Provence. There I found Le Clerc ten times more furious than ever. He loaded me
with a thousand invectives. It had it seems been found out that Annette was
with child, and he swore he would rather see her expire than that she
should bring a heretic into the world. Vainly I repre∣sented 
<PB N="109" REF="142"/> to him that he was now compelled, by every motive of
honour and justice, to make us one. He vowed my destruction.</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'After hovering about the place for a
considera∣ble while—employing every emissary my purse could
procure, to trace out where they had se∣questered Annette—and having
learnt no more than that she was admitted into a convent at a con∣siderable
distance till she should lie in, upon con∣dition of taking the veil
immediately afterwards, I was musing one day what further course to
pur∣sue, when my servant came running in, with the greatest horror
pictured in his countenance, and told me if I did not immediately fly, I
should be imprisoned for life, for that his dear lady—so he always
called Annette—had died in childbed, after bringing forth a girl, and
that her father, out of revenge, had procured a <HI>lettre de cachet</HI>
against my person.</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Shocked as I was at this fatal news, I did not
however neglect my safety, to which I was not a little prompted by a lively
desire to succour the little innocent pledge of our tender affection. I
therefore followed my man through a back field, mounted a horse of my
own—for I feared to go <PB N="110" REF="143"/> post—and made the
best of my way towards Sa∣voy.</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'On the road my man informed me that the
pos∣tilion who drove us to the house where Annette was taken ill, happened
to set a company down at Provence some time afterwards, where being told,
among other things, of the bustle Le Clerc had made in searching after his
daughter to no purpose, began to be convinced, by putting different
cir∣cumstances together, that it must be her he had driven in my company:
for it had been explained to him that she had gone off with an English
gentle∣man. In hopes, therefore, of a bribe on the other side, he went to Le
Clerc, confessed to him where he had taken us, informed him of Annette's
ill∣ness, and assured him that, as we talked of going to Geneva, if he
could not overtake us, there was a great chance of catching us as we returned,
es∣pecially if we went to that house; for as we must have stopt there
some time, they would, at any rate, be able to give a good account of
us.</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Le Clerc did not hesitate a moment, but set
out with two friends and a party of the <HI>Marechause</HI>', who came to the
inn <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ome hours after we had left it.
There they got every intelligence they want∣ed, <PB N="111" REF="144"/> and
quickening their diligence, they soon over∣took us, as I have already
described.</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'My servant also told me that he did not
believe a syllable of Annette's death. His real opinion was that she had
taken the veil, for that it was a very common thing for their friends to give
out, whenever that event took place, that they were dead, to prevent
troublesome importunity; and in the present instance it was extremely
probable; be∣cause, could I have found out the convent to which she was
devoted, I should have left nothing un∣tried to shake that vow which I was
sure she never would have taken but by compulsion.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'And for heaven's sake,' said the widow,
'what is become of the child?'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'She is well madam,'—answered the
baronet.</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'But where?' said the wi∣dow.</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'At a school about twenty miles off,' replied
Sir Sidney.</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'You astonish me,' replied she. 'How did
you preserve her?'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'You shall hear,' said the baronet.</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Having left respectable connections in
Provence, I received intelligence from thence, that, very soon after I left
France, Le Clerc quitted that part of the kingdom; but they never could hear to
what <PB N="112" REF="145"/> place he retired. About two years
afterwards—no longer apprehending any ill consequences from the
<HI>lettre de cachet—</HI>I went again to Provence; but, however, had my
journey for my pains.</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Three other visits were made with no better
success. Last year, however, I was more fortu∣nate; for I had not been
many days in the town before a nun of the order of St. Clare called at my
friend's house, and demanded to speak to me.—She informed me that her
order being one of those which are allowed to have intercourse at certain
times with the world, she was desired by an ab∣bess of another convent to
let me know that my child would be delivered up to me.</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'You may believe I was charmed with this
intel∣ligence. I went with her to the convent, where I enquired very
earnestly for Annette; but they confirmed every thing I had before heard. Nay
I was even shewn her grave, which you may be as∣sured I watered with my
tears. In short, I came away, bringing with me her living model, who I
sincerely believe was not out of my arms an hour at a time till my arrival in
Warwickshire.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Your doubts after this subsided, I
suppose?' <PB N="113" REF="146"/> cried the widow.</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'I cannot say they did,' returned the baronet:
'the little creature at this moment talks of Madame Le Clerc, whom she used
to call mamma, in a great house, like a church. I there∣fore think my being
shewn the grave was a reli∣gious fraud, invented to deter me from searching
for her in vain.</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'She is certainly irrecoverably gone, and
there∣fore dead to me. No, I shall never forget her, but let me not forget
myself. Providence per∣mitted this separation perhaps to punish us for
the crime of having impetuously gratified our wishes before they received
the sanction of religion. It is a heavy punishment, but I will not incur a
greater by repining.'</Q></P>
<P>Here Sir Sidney paused. Several parts of his narrative were
recapitulated, and a variety of reflec∣tions grew out of them on the
instability of human expectations. Sir Sidney apologized to Mrs. Mal∣plaquet
for having so freely opened his heart to her, and she sincerely
assured him it had considerably augmented her esteem for him.</P>
<P>I shall not trouble the reader with his reply, or her
rejoinder; but only say, that after a number of <PB N="114" REF="147"/> civil
things had passed on both sides, he reminded her that he wanted a mother
for his child, and she, without affectation, at length promised to
undertake that task.</P>
<P>In a word, she shortly after became Lady Roe∣buck, to the
great satisfaction of the baronet, the confusion of Standfast, and the
universal joy of Cas∣tlewick.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER I.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>A CLEARING OF THE COURSE, PREPARATORY TO THE NEXT HEAT.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>As a variety of circumstances—many of them very
unexpectedly—will shortly present themselves to the reader, I think
it necessary, as far as I may conceive it our mutual interest, to prepare
him for their reception. Indeed it is my intention to adopt this practice
frequently in the course of this history: not in such a way however as to
anticipate any thing. Nay I will not promise that these explanations
shall always be literally what they seem; for should I wish to cover or
disguise any circumstance till the proper moment of making it known, I
hope he will not be angry if I put him a little upon a false 
<PB N="116" REF="149"/> scent, by way of exercise, to get him an appetite to
the real game, when at last he shall come up with it.</P>
<P>I beg however it may be understood that these false lights
are not intended unnecessarily to lead him astray. I know this literary
Will o' th' Wisp is often introduced; but I disclaim it as an unpar∣donable
and impotent attempt at a spurious wit, which is really an affront to every
intelligent reader. So much indeed do I hold such sort of trifling a thing
that ought on no account to be excused, that I desire this work may be
considered perfect only in proportion as every circumstance, even the
most minute and apparently insignificant, tends to pro∣mote the general
effect, and that effect holds out a laudable and improving moral.</P>
<P>We have heard very little of Standfast since the death of
Major Malplaquet. This worthy wight, which will be very little doubted, laid
strong siege to the widow; for, as I said before, she became, at her
husband's decease, very wealthy. She, how∣ever, having nobody to please
but herself, gave him such a reception as soon convinced him that his
hopes were like some of the projects of our late builders—fair, and
elegantly finished in the estimate, but mere skeletons in practice.</P>
<P><PB N="117" REF="150"/> Thus disappointed, he pocketed his
trifle, as he called the three thousand pounds, and decamped; contenting
himself with whispering that he might very easily have married the widow
if he had thought proper, but knowing ones were not to be taken in: that women
who would sip in the time of their first husbands, might taste when
they got a second; and that perhaps, had he been fool enough to be caught, he
might have doated too, and so have gotten a lusty chaplain to help him out,
as somebody else did.</P>
<P>These gross jokes were faithfully retailed by Mr. Flush.
Not however without a finish, that if the go∣vernor—meaning
Standfast—had braced the drum of matrimony, a certain genteel dapper
cock of an humble servant of his would not have feared coming in for a
trevally, or so.</P>
<P>I have never told the reader that Mr. Standfast and Mr. Viney
were very intimate friends; and perhaps he has divined why: if not, he will
presently. The fact however was so. They had known each other for several
years, and indeed upon Viney's being civilly dismissed from Lord Hazard's
house, he con∣sulted Standfast, whom he well knew to be a per∣fect
Machiavel in domestic politics, upon the like∣liest means to preserve his
declining interest in that family.</P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="151"/> The stream of Standfast's interest
going, at that time, in another channel, nothing came of the ne∣gociation; but
the major being dead, and he ex∣pelled from the presence of the widow, the
two friends finding themselves in the same situation, and that the
interest of one was the interest of both, they laid their heads together,
and considered of the matter in every point of view. At length they agreed
that nothing could so perfectly answer their several wishes as to get
Standfast into Lord Hazard's family. Take their own words.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'It is such a damned good scheme,' said
Stand∣fast, 'that I envy you for thinking on it; but I am devlishly afraid
it is not practicable.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'You are right,' cried Viney, 'let us tread
sure. Go on warily: I know his foibles, that is one thing in our favour.'</Q>

<Q REND="inline">'How is he for a first sight attack?' said
Standfast.</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'A very dove,' cried Viney; 'a greenhorn.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'That is lucky,' said Standfast; 'we have
nothing then to consider of but the introduction. Does he know any thing of
me?'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Only by hearsay,' replied Viney, 'and now I
recollect, what he did hear was to your ad∣vantage. Let me see what was it?
Oh that the major, out of his great friendship, had left you 
<PB N="119" REF="152"/> considerably; and, in particular, had commanded his
lady on his death bed to take you for her se∣cond husband.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Ridiculous!' cried Standfast: 'the old fellow
never spoke after the accident; and as to the wi∣dow, my dear Sir, she was
too peery. No, no, nothing less than the title of my lady would con∣tent
her.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Odso,' said Viney, 'I wonder at it too. You
used to be pretty sure of your mark when the doe was to be struck. Ha,
ha, ha.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'True, true,' cried Standfast, 'but this was
so skittish, she would have taken more powder and shot, as well as
patience, than I would spare upon any such doe, were she the
transformation of a goddess. Hang her, let her go. She has enough to say
against me; but, if she prattles, we must retaliate, right or
wrong.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'That to be sure,' said Viney 'is but
self-de∣fence: but to our business. Lord Hazard is now seeking out a
tutor for his favourite Charles, and I own I should like to gall him there.
Hey my friend, am I not right? There I feel my sister's injuries.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Well hit faith,' cried Standfast.—'They
tell me it is a fine mettled boy, I will bring him up well.'</Q></P>
<P><PB N="120" REF="153"/> 
<Q REND="inline">'Not so fast,' interrupted Viney. 'In the
first place, did he know of our intimacy, it would be an immoveable bar to
our design; and then he is determined to receive none but an exemplary
cha∣racter.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Me again!' exclaimed Standfast. I will give
him examples of pleasure that might resuscitate old Anacreon; that is to
say, behind his father's back: and lessons of morality, before his face,
that might be heard and approved by listening an∣gels.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'But still our intimacy,' said Viney.</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'We must get over that,' replied Standfast.
'Let me see—I have it—can't I introduce myself to some family
in town?—or make my court to any relation of the wife? Zounds, now I
recollect, there is a capital house in the city—Ingot, the
wire-drawer—where they make me very welcome. Lord Ha∣zard occasionally
banks there. If I can but get recommended to preach two or three charity
ser∣mons, and afterwards invited to dine with the stewards, the
business is done. I am sure Mr. In∣got is under obligations enow to me;
for I so did up his elder brother, by making him genteel, that, in
consequence of two or three genteel <HI>faux</HI> <PB N="121" REF="154"/>
<HI>pas,</HI> he at last genteelly finished himself, by which this
remaining brother got to be head of the firm: and so you see, Viney, one
good turn deserves ano∣ther.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'True, true,' said Viney.</Q></P>
<P>So said, so done. Standfast left a friend to offi∣ciate
for him at Little Hockley, and repaired to town, where he so well set his
engines to work, that, in six months, he not only got introduced to Lord
Hazard, but contrived so to sustain the several es∣says made on his
disposition and abilities, that he issued from that ordeal through
which the reader may remember my lord was determined his son's tutor should
pass so perfect, as to fix himself se∣curely in that nobleman's good
opinion; and in∣deed—which I should not think it necessary to set
down, but by way of regularity—Mr. Standfast was the very gentleman
introduced to Lady Hazard in the fourth chapter of the first book, in quality
of tutor to her son.</P>
<P>If the reader should wonder how it came to pass that Lord
Hazard did not know the irregularities of Standfast, especially as one was
curate of Little Hockley, and the other landlord, I must inform him that his
lordship had never visited his estate in Warwickshire but once after
his second marriage, <PB N="122" REF="155"/> but repaired to a villa about
twenty miles from London, which he bought soon after he came of age. Indeed,
as soon as he determined to give over his excesses, Little Hockley was
the last place upon earth he wished to think of. His rents were punc∣tually
remitted, and this was all he ever would hear upon the subject.</P>
<P>Neither his reformation, however, nor this cau∣tion altered his
character in the opinion of the vil∣lagers; for as the sons and daughters of
Little Hock∣ley were many of them of his getting, and the rest very ambitious
to be thought so, they never dreamt that he had any virtues, but remembered
his vices only, glorying in them, and speaking of them in so familiar and
shameless a manner, as if every meal they tasted was the sweeter for
being garnished with the bread of dishonour.</P>
<P>I will not suppose my reader to be so inexperi∣enced as to
think that Standfast's views were merely confined to his intention of
becoming the tutor of Charles; nor, on the other hand, will I believe him so
sagacious as to discover what they really were.—We can scarcely
credit that a man of this worthy clergyman's consummate experience in human
traf∣fic had not a material point to carry, especially now 
<PB N="123" REF="156"/> he was in partnership with Viney. If it was so it
will certainly come in its proper place, which, un∣less I had a
wish—which I really have not—to de∣stroy the reader's
pleasure, cannot possibly be here.</P>
<P>Having fixed Mr. Standfast in the family of Lord Hazard, we
will now speak of Mr. Flush. That valiant thumper of parchment having
received a handsome sum and a long lesson from his quondam master,
was transferred, through Viney, to the ori∣ginal Lady Hazard, now reduced to
Mrs. O'Shock∣nesy, and by her again transferred to her son, at college.</P>
<P>I shall also say that Mrs. O'Shocknesy was pre∣sent at
one or two of the latter consultations relative to the grand business;
nor indeed was Flush abso∣lutely left out. It was, on the contrary, found
ne∣cessary to let him partially into the matter; for said he, very
archly, 
<Q REND="inline">'If you don't let me into the maxim of the
thing, how the devil shall I be able to move your figures for you?'</Q></P>
<P>A letter from Flush to Standfast, after he had been six
months at Eton, shall finish this chapter.—I shall give it the
reader in his own words.

<P>Generals have been known to settle with their aid de camps a
kind of characters so unintelligible to any but themselves, that should
information fall into the enemy's hand, no ill consequence could ensue. One
<PB N="125" REF="158"/> would think Standfast and Flush had made this same
agreement. In truth, did I believe the reader could make Kiddy's letter into
English, I should not have inserted it. As it is, I shall leave it, by
way of aenigma, which he may either stay and solve, or go on to the next
chapter, and so leave the ex∣planation of that and every thing else to what
I may conceive the proper season for it.</P>
<P>I would nevertheless have that, as well as many other
particulars in this chapter, carefully attended to. Gangrenes begin by a
small spot, and the egg of a crocodile has as inoffensive an appearance

<PB REF="159"/>
<HEAD>CHAPTER II.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>IN WHICH THE GAME BEGINS.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>Mr. STANDFAST no sooner sat down in Lord Ha∣zard's family
than, like a spy in an enemy's camp, he began to reconnoitre its situation,
strength, and disposition; to examine whether the body was well united,
whether there were any rotten members, whether centinels dared to sleep on
their posts, whe∣ther the commanding officer was most loved or
feared—In short, to use his own words—though I would not have
the reader infer from thence that he was a cobler in his business—he
had the length of every foot in the family.</P>
<P>Not however to be outdone in courtesy, there was not one among
them that had not something to say in his favour. My Lord declared he was a
man of strong intellects and sound erudition. He did not think him a
saint, nor wish him to be one. Solid argument, for ought he could see,
might as well be discussed over a glass as a lamp, and as to gaiety and
carelessness, he dreaded nothing from them, for they could harbour no ill
designs. He was a little <PB N="127" REF="160"/> surprised at hearing from
Standfast that he had been frequently in his life taken in, but it gave him
an opportunity of exercising his sagacity by remarking that those who mix
most with the world, know least of it:—as it was said of Lord
ANSON, after he had been a prey to sharpers, that he had been over the world,
but never in it. Upon the whole, he thought Mr. Standfast a fair,
undesigning man, and both a proper tutor for his son, and companion for
him∣self.</P>
<P>Lady Hazard was no less prepossessed in favour of the
tutor. She looked upon him as an unaffected cheerful man, perfectly well bred;
and, as she saw his being in the house gave her lord particular
satis∣faction, really felicitated herself upon this acquisi∣tion to the
family.</P>
<P>The butler liked him; for though he could well distinguish
the different qualities of the wine, yet he never made use of his knowledge
to a poor ser∣vant's disadvantage. In short, there was not a per∣son in
the family whose good opinion he had not been anxious to procure, and one
would have thought with more care and industry than belonged to such a
trifle; for he so succeeded, that he was al∣lowed to be a true servant's
friend.</P>
<P><PB N="128" REF="161"/> Mr. Standfast had certainly no Iago to
egg him on. He knew however, as well as that subtle gen∣tleman himself,
that trifles light as air in cases of art are of great use, and he doubted
not but they would as much conduce to answer the purposes of one kind of
hypocrisy as another.</P>
<P>As to the pupil, he loved Standfast like a father, and took
instructions from him full as fast as the other could give it, which,
between ourselves, not a little embarrassed the tutor, who, begging Lord
Hazard's pardon, was not so profound a scholar as that kind patron, in his
liberal warmth, had repre∣sented him.</P>
<P>Standfast, feeling this deficiency, pressed his
lord∣ship to carry his scheme into execution, of having Charles taught
music and painting: thinking, and very rightly, that relieved by those
avocations, he should be able to make his stock of learning last as long
as he might have occasion for it.</P>
<P>Having worked his materials into a proper tem∣per, Mr.
Standfast now began to think of moulding them to his different purposes,
but this required the nicest care and circumspection. My Lord plumed
himself upon being no novice, and Lady Hazard's amiable heart and
unconquerable duty <PB N="129" REF="162"/> barred all possibility of
flattering the most distant hopes, had there been any such conceived, of
stag∣gering her virtue, or even her prudence.</P>
<P>Something Mr. Standfast was certainly hatching up, and while
it was in contemplation, a most sin∣gular circumstance happened, which
that gentle∣man did not fail to lay up as food for his project.</P>
<P>Lord and Lady Hazard were one night in a side box at the
playhouse, where, behind them, sat a lady and two gentlemen, one of whom
the fair one often called brother, and the other Sir Daniel. At the end of the
amusement, while they were waiting for their carriage, one of these
gentlemen, seeing a per∣son go out of the opposite box, exclaimed, 
<Q REND="inline">'there he goes, and by God I'll be after
him.'</Q> Imme∣diately upon this he darted out of the box, followed by the
other, who warmly entreated him not to be precipitate. Almost at the same
moment the lady shrieked out 
<Q REND="inline">'Good God there will be murder,'</Q> and
immediately fainted away.</P>
<P>Neither the good offices of Lord Hazard nor his lady were
wanting to restore her, which desirable event they at length happily
achieved. The lady now begged for heaven's sake he would have the goodness
to conduct her to her coach, which entreaty. <PB N="128" REF="163"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/> <PB N="129" REF="164"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/> <PB N="130" REF="165"/> Lady
Hazard seconded with all her eloquence.—Upon this the lady's footman
from the lobby sum∣moned the coach to the door, and my lord having very
politely seen her into it, returned with an in∣tention to join Lady Hazard.
In his way he en∣countered one of the gentlemen he had seen in the box, who
accosted him with 
<Q REND="inline">'I must thank you Sir for the civility you
have done me.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Sir,' an∣swered Lord Hazard, with great
politeness, 'if you mean in respect to any attention shewn to the lady,
it was but my duty, and I am already thanked.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'I dare say you are,' replied the other, 'but
that won't go down with me: In short, you are a scoundrel, and I insist
upon deciding the matter immediately: it can be done in this
tavern.'—</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Sir,' said Lord Hazard, very spiritedly, 'I
do not think myself obliged to answer so unprovoked and rude an
assault, but as every thing in your ap∣pearance, except this insult,
calls you gentleman, I attend you Sir.'</Q></P>
<P>At this moment Standfast, who had been at the other theatre,
and had, by promise, returned to go home with Lord Hazard, came up, and
boldly en∣quired who it was that dared to insult that noble∣man?—upon
which, a crowd having gathered about, the cry was 
<Q REND="inline">'settle it in the tavern—settle it in
the tavern.'</Q> There they now adjourned, but not be∣fore 
<PB N="131" REF="166"/> Lord Hazard had dispatched Standfast to his lady, to
request that she would stay, for that he should be immediately with
her.</P>
<P>When they were come to the place of explana∣tion, Lord Hazard
was more at a loss than ever.—The gentleman who had insulted him,
brought a∣gainst him a direct accusation of carrying on a clan∣destine
correspondence with his sister, which he said was doubly
dishonourable, as she was at the point of marriage to a worthy young
baronet.</P>
<P>This charge was parried by a declaration that, till the
present evening, the lord had never seen the lady; but the brother treated
this excuse with con∣tempt, and was for fighting it out instantly, mixing
his invectives with some insinuations about a mas∣querade. The company,
however, opposed his warmth; and the clamour was so various and vio∣lent,
that nothing distinctly could be understood. It was therefore determined,
as with one voice, that the affair should not then be decided; but, as it
seemed a matter of delicacy, the disputants should privately exchange
addresses, and meet, with each a friend, to talk the business over in
the morning. This was immediately complied with, and now arrived Stand∣fast,
with news that Lady Hazard had quitted the boxes, and he supposed was gone
home.</P>
<P><PB N="132" REF="167"/> Lord Hazard and Standfast betook
themselves to a hackney coach, in which, on their way, the latter was made
acquainted, as far as my lord knew it, with this mysterious business.
Standfast said it must have originated in some mistake, which he
supposed would be cleared up on the morrow; for, added he, 
<Q REND="inline">'you never saw the lady before, did you my
lord?'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Never in my life,' said Lord Hazard.</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Nay,' said Standfast, 'if you had, the
fellow need not have made such a piece of work about it, for I am very much
mistaken or she is one of the right sort; and very likely the brother is
only a led knight, employed to bully in her cause; therefore, were I your
lordship, I would take care, if I must be forced into a duel, it should
be with a gentle∣man.'</Q></P>
<P>My Lord declared that he most sincerely believed the lady
was a woman of honour; for, said he, 
<Q REND="inline">'I never saw more unaffected signs of
modesty. As to the brother, I think with you, that the whole matter will
prove a mistake, and the affair blow over.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'You know, my lord,' cried Standfast, 'I
always yield to you in matters of experience; however, we shall see, for I
hope I am to have the honour of accompanying your lordship
to-morrow.'</Q></P>
<P><PB N="133" REF="168"/> 
<Q REND="inline">'Why I was thinking so too,' said my lord,
'but as the gentleman may unfortunately happen to call in my absence, and as
it would be a kind of tacit reflection on my honour if he should go away
unsatisfied, I will get you to stay and receive him. I hope, however to
prevent his coming; for I shall be out very early, to convince him that I am
as anxious to bring this business to a finish as him∣self. As to a
second, you know, if it should be necessary, I can take our friend
Colonel Tiltly.'</Q></P>
<P>They now arrived at Lord Hazard's house, where they found my
lady, who informed them that hav∣ing stayed till there was no soul in the
theatre but herself, she prevailed on the box-keeper to find her
servants, and see her to her coach: 
<Q REND="inline">'But, my lord,' said she, 'what could
possibly detain you?'</Q></P>
<P>Lord Hazard, who had never considered that this question
would certainly be asked him, was totally unprepared to answer it. After
some hesitation, however, he faultered out, in great apparent confu∣sion,
<Q REND="inline">'Nay not the lady, I assure you my
love.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'I did not know but she might have had another
fit,' said Lady Hazard: 'in that case it would have been inhumanity to have
left her.'</Q></P>
<P><PB N="134" REF="169"/> 
<Q REND="inline">'Why if it had been so,' replied my lord,
'where would have been the great crime in it?'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Crime!' returned her ladyship, 'I had no idea
of any such thing. Charity is no crime my lord: but really your looks
accuse you more than I do. I appeal to any body, if I was a jealous wife,
whe∣ther a stander-by would blame me if I should be suspicious at this
moment?'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Well then upon my honour madam,' said Lord
Hazard, 'I only saw the lady to her coach, and was returning to you, but a
particular business, which happened very unexpectedly, prevented me. This
Mr. Standfast knows to be truth.'</Q></P>
<P>Standfast was here beginning a very handsome excuse for
his friend, when the lady stopt him, and addressing herself to my lord,
said, 
<Q REND="inline">'My dear, if you had not made this last
declaration, if your friend here had not seconded you, if I had actu∣ally
been told that you went home with the lady, that she was an old acquaintance
of yours, and that she came into the box by your appointment, I should
never have mentioned the subject again;—therefore, I beg my lord I may
not hear of it from you.'</Q></P>
<P><PB N="135" REF="170"/> 
<Q REND="inline">'This is ridiculous,' said his lordship,
'you conjure up a parcel of imaginary stuff, and then argue upon it as if it
really existed.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'God forbid it ever should exist,' said
the lady, 'I only mention it to shew, if it really did, what a good wife I
should be.'</Q></P>
<P>Supper was now brought in, and the subject of course
dropt.</P>
<P>The three persons concerned in it, however, did not so
easily dismiss it from their thoughts as they had from their tongues.
They neither eat much supper, nor enjoyed much rest; and, what appears very
extraordinary, Standfast, who one should think was least concerned,
ruminated on it the most.</P>
<P>Perhaps the catastrophe of this adventure may bring out what
his cogitations were. Those of Lord and Lady Hazard may be very easily
guessed. I cannot help, however, remarking that this night was the first
they ever slept together without speak∣ing to each other, nor did my lord
ever before leave his lady so early, or so abruptly.</P>
<P>If the reader wishes the matter to clear up, and 
<PB N="136" REF="171"/> that a reconciliation should take place, it is more
than Mr. Standfast did, who very archly remarked, as he came down stairs in
the morning, that he must be a bungling physician indeed who did not know
how to irritate as well as to cure.</P>

<PB REF="172"/>
<HEAD>CHAPTER III.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>A CONTINUATION OF THE SAME SPORT.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>LADY Hazard having been told by my lord's gen∣tleman that her
husband was gone out, and had left word he should not return perhaps till
dinner, sat down to breakfast with Mr. Standfast and her son Charles,
which meal, however, was very short; for the tutor appeared exceedingly
anxious to introduce his pupil to some new author, with whom the young
gentleman seemed as evidently to wish himself ac∣quainted. They therefore
retired to the library, and left the lady to herself, who, for some minutes
afterwards, continued in a profound reverie, not knowing what to make of her
husband's having gone out so unprecedentedly; for as to the adventure of
the preceding night, she had pretty well made up her mind on it.</P>
<P>There was not much time to reflect on that or any thing else
before the door opened, and a person walked into the room, whom Lady Hazard
knew immediately for the very same Sir Daniel whom she had seen at the
playhouse. She was for a moment <PB N="138" REF="173"/> astonished, but,
recollecting herself, she got up, and was making her way towards the bell,
when the gen∣tleman, who, for some reason or other, did not seem to
approve of her taking that step, got the start of her, and disputed the
pass.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'No, no, my dear madam,' said he, 'that cannot
be; you must suffer me to prevent you. Besides, what would your
servants say, if you called them about you?'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Say Sir!' answered the lady, with a look of
in∣effable disdain, 'one of them was witness to your ruffian-like behaviour
last night, and would want no order from me to treat you as you
merit—which chastisement if you do not wish to provoke, you will
begone instantly.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Not till you have granted my pardon,' said
he. 'By heaven this visit, which I have managed to a miracle, was meant only
as an atonement for my last night's offence. 'Twas
madness—liquor—any thing you will.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Dare not Sir,' said the lady, 'to affront my
ears with your gross insolence.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Nay then,' cried he, 'there is but a moment,
and by heaven I will not lose it. Charming creature look with 
<PB N="139" REF="174"/> pity on me!'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'What do you mean!' exclaimed Lady Hazard. 'Nay
unhand me, or I'll raise the house!'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Never,' cried the ravisher; 'this mi∣nute
shall seal my happiness.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Heavens!' cried the lady, 'shall I be treated
thus!—is there no one near me!'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Yes madam,' cried Standfast, who entered the
room, 'there is one near you, and ever ready thus to treat the villain who
shall dare to wrong such beauty and innocence.'</Q> So saying, he flew at
the ravisher as if he would have throttled him. Then pausing:— 
<Q REND="inline">'But hold,' said he, 'my regard to Lady
Hazard's character protects you in this house:—Tell me who you are, and
expect me in half an hour at the Smyrna.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'I am called,' said the other, 'Sir Daniel
Dog-bolt, and will not fail you may be assured. As to you madam,' said
he, 'I sincerely regret that I have given you a moment's pain. What a wretch
I am—last night—Oh that it had been prosperous, or that I could
blot it from my memory!'</Q></P>
<P>Here he left the room, and Mr. Standfast ringing the bell, a
servant presently made his appearance, who asking if he was wanted, was
told only to see the gentleman out; to which he answered that John 
<PB N="140" REF="175"/> had opened the door, and the gentleman offered him half
a guinea, but he would not take it. 
<Q REND="inline">'Very well,' said Standfast, 'take away the
things;'</Q> which while the servant was doing, he whispered to Lady Hazard
to compose herself:—for she was on a sofa, and seemed indeed
extremely flurried.</P>
<P>When the servant was gone out of the room, Stand∣fast
advanced to Lady Hazard, and said, 
<Q REND="inline">'I should be extremely unhappy if, zealous in
your lady∣ship's cause, I have done any thing in this business contrary
to your wishes.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Good God!' cried the lady, 'how can you have
such an idea, Mr. Standfast? A ruffian assaulted me, and you came to my
assistance. Can such conduct demand any thing less from me than the
warmest thanks.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Madam I beg your pardon,' said Standfast,
'but it has been a strange business altogether. I had for one
moment—perhaps for which I ought never to be forgiven—forgot the
unsullied purity of Lady Hazard; and when I heard from the gen∣tleman that
insinuation concerning last night—but it is impossible—I
see it—he must be a villain. I will answer with my life that if
ever a heart was the mansion of innocence, yours is.'</Q></P>
<P><PB N="141" REF="176"/> 
<Q REND="inline">'I thank you for your opinion sir,' said the
lady, 'I hope I deserve it. As to last night, I will not make a mystery
of it now, though I thought I had sufficient reason for it then. After my
lord left me, this bold man came back to the box, and see∣ing me alone, began
to enquire what was become of the lady? I told him that, at my desire, my
lord had conducted her to her coach; upon which he said he would remain to
thank him for his ci∣vility, as well as to protect me from any
insult.—He behaved very properly at first, but, as the house
thinned, his conversation took quite a different turn. He first said he
wondered my lord did not return; then said he was surely gone home with the
lady; and at last assured me that, to his know∣ledge, she was an old
acquaintance of his. At length he ventured at some rude freedoms, but at that
moment John came to ask me if he should draw off the coach, and seeing
what passed, did not hesitate to treat the ruffian pretty severely for
his insolence.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Blessings on him for it,' cried
Standfast, 'as well as for refusing the money just now; I never thought
it of him I confess before; but I see he is a noble fellow:—but go on
madam.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'I suffered myself,' said Lady Hazard, 'to
be <PB N="142" REF="177"/> conducted by my servant and the box-keeper to my
coach, and came home, when having cautioned John never to open his lips on the
subject, I took the resolution of keeping it from my husband's knowledge,
for fear of his resentment.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Nothing could be more commendable certainly,'
said Standfast. 'Insufferable impudence; in a pub∣lic place too, a fellow
you had never seen before I suppose. And then to have recourse to that
stale trick of accusing my lord!—so worthy a charac∣ter; so good
a husband!'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Heaven forbid I should think him
otherwise,' said the lady; 'but how came this audacious man here? Which of
the servants could shew him into this apartment?'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Oh I can account for that,' said
Standfast.—</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Can you sir,' said the lady.</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'That is to say,' an∣swered the tutor, 'I
think I can guess. You know my lord entrusted me with the business of
last night, upon which, between ourselves, he is gone out this
morning.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Well, and what then?' said the lady, a little
peevishly.</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'What then,' cried Stand∣fast, 'really it is
so awkward a business to answer, you had better not enquire about it;
for, upon my word, I am not at liberty to tell you.'</Q></P>
<P><PB N="143" REF="178"/> 
<Q REND="inline">'This is the strangest mystery,' said
the lady—'Surely if you know any thing of the matter, you can explain to
me how this man came here?'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Why very true,' returned Standfast, 'as far
as it relates to that madam, I can have no objection. My lord, upon going out
this morning, desired me to receive every person who should call, and I
suppose, as I had not left the breakfast room five minutes when this
pretty gentleman was shewn up here—'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'But still that is very extraordinary,' said
the lady, 'for no servant announced him.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Why then certainly he must have been
previ∣ously shewn into the library,' said Standfast, while Charles and
I were in the little study Sup∣pose I ring to know: but, upon second
thoughts, I had better not. One servant already has been witness
of—but, however, I will quiet him.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'I cannot think of it,' said the lady, 'and
what∣ever may be the consequence, rather than my con∣duct should appear
so equivocal, I am resolved to acquaint my lord with every thing, just as
it has fallen out.'</Q></P>
<P><PB N="144" REF="179"/> 
<Q REND="inline">'You would not surely be so mad,' cried
Stand∣fast. 'He has quite enough upon his hands about it already: I tremble
for him at this moment.'—</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Good God,' said the lady, 'one would think
you wanted to drive me distracted. Why tremble for him? What has he upon his
hands?'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'I beg your pardon madam, returned Standfast;
my anxiety, my warmth—Oh that I could dis∣semble like other men: this
absurd frankness of mine is always leading me into scrapes.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Mr. Standfast,' said the lady, very
earnestly, 'if you have any thing to tell me that regards my
happiness—for I now begin to suspect you have—do not keep me
in this dreadful suspence: if, on the contrary, my husband has
entrusted you with any thing, and enjoined you not to inform me, convince him
of your friendship, by shewing you are worthy of his confidence.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Good heaven!' said Standfast, 'where is
there such another woman to be found?—of such nice
prudence!—such delicate honour! What my lord entrusted me with,
madam, he certainly left to my own discretion. However, as one would think it
implied a wish to conceal every thing from you—<PB N="145" REF="180"/>
and yet a breach of confidence where any thing so valuable as your peace of
mind is concerned would—'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'By no means,' interrupted the lady; 'nothing
could induce you to forgive yourself.'—</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'But, my dear madam,' cried Standfast, finding
her curiosity so tardy, 'the thing cannot remain a se∣cret, the
newspapers will be full of it.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Well Sir,' cried the lady, 'it will then be
time enough to tell me what I now plainly see will make me wretched whenever
I know it.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'I may not live perhaps till then madam,' said
Standfast.</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Not live!' said Lady Hazard; 'what do you
mean?'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Surely you forget my appointment,' said
Standfast, 'with the gentleman at the Smyrna.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'You will not be so mad,' cried she.</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'How!' returned Standfast, 'my honour is
engaged, and in your cause. Adieu, and if I should fall, do me the
justice to reflect that my last moments were spent in your
service.'</Q></P>
<P>So saying, he ran precipitately down stairs, re∣gardless
of Lady Hazard, who several times called after him to return. She now
summoned John into her presence, told him to go immediately to the Smyrna
coffee-house, and desire, in her name, that Mr. Standfast would come
back, and that if he saw any mischief going on, to call any
assistance he could to prevent it.</P>
<P><PB N="146" REF="181"/> John was scarcely out of sight when
Lady Hazard reflected what a strange errand she had sent him on, and was
about to ring the bell to dispatch another servant after him, when she
recollected this would be only making bad worse.</P>
<P>Thus situated, it is impossible to describe what she
felt. Anger for my lord—compassion for Stand∣fast—fear for
herself, intruded all at once on her gentle mind; and yet she knew not
why.</P>
<P>In the midst of this contention she sought for her son,
with a view in his conversation to alleviate her uneasiness, when going
into the library the first ob∣ject that struck her was Lord Hazard, who had
gone there in search of Standfast. Nothing could equal their mutual
surprise; out of which my lord first recovering himself, said, 
<Q REND="inline">'So madam, I am come home you see.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Yes,' said the lady, 'and before dinner
too.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Well,' cried my lord, 'are you not obliged to
me?'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'My Lord,' said Lady Ha∣zard, 'I shall never
think myself obliged to you for any conduct of which I don't know the
motive.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Pshaw!' cried my lord, 'you know I hate
dis∣content.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'And I dissimulation,' said the
lady.'</Q></P>
<P>They were going on in this manner when Charles 
<PB N="147" REF="182"/> came into the room with a book. 
<Q REND="inline">'Oh madam,' said he, 'are you here? Where is
Mr. Standfast? I came to shew him the prettiest thing I ever met with in
my life. Shall I read it my lord?'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'I am in no reading mood at present,' said
Lord Hazard.</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Read it to me, my love,' answered the
lady.</Q></P>
<P>Charles answered, with strong indications of sur∣prise
at the looks of his parents, 
<Q REND="inline">'I would read it to you, but it is in Greek;
however, I will tell you the sense of it. It is an allegorical allusion
to the polity of either a kingdom or a family, and given in the way of advice
by a sage to a king, who had quarrelled with his subjects.</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'There was a river,' says the author, 'that
de∣lighted to expand its smooth surface to the beams of the sun. Its
banks were embossed with ver∣dure, it nourished myriads of scaly
inhabitants, and it glided through the meadows with a placid and majestic
grandeur, to the surprise and delight of every beholder. An unexpected
cataract, from a neighbouring mountain, on a sudden dimmed its lustre and
ruffled its tranquillity; till, hurried by the overbearing conflux, it forced
itself into two distinct channels:—there murmuring, it bemoaned 
<PB N="148" REF="183"/> its sad and vagrant fate. At last, each stream, as
if by joint consent, burst the banks which sepa∣rated them, and they met
together in affectionate reconcilement, no more to part till divided by the
ocean.</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Thus,' says our author, 'after intestine
broils, may every kingdom or family, endeared by love and loyalty, unite, and
never separate till re∣ceived into the bosom of fate.'</Q></P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER IV.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>MATTER OF THE SAME COMPLEXION.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>CHARLES having finished his allegory, asked his parents how
they liked it? Lord Hazard said he believed there were very few kingdoms or
families either that were not subject to such cataracts.—Charles
answered it must then be mismanagement in not properly guarding against
them.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'You are right my dear,' said his mother, 'but
what can be done with inundations that force their way like miners in a town,
and do mischief in pro∣portion as their source is concealed.'</Q></P>
<P>Perhaps my lord took this as something meant at him, for
looking very earnestly at his lady, he said 
<Q REND="inline">'you are wonderfully sagacious madam;'</Q> and
then turning to his son, asked what he had done with Mr. Standfast.</P>
<P>Here John entered the library, saying, 
<Q REND="inline">'Madam, I went as your ladyship ordered me,
but they were gone.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Oh,' said the lady in great apparent
con∣fusion, <PB N="150" REF="185"/> 'ta—'tis—very well
John—and when does her ladyship—'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Ladyship!' answered John, first looking
at Lord Hazard, and then at his lady.—</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'But you say they were gone,' returned the
lady.</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Well, tell Frill I am going to my dressing
room.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Yes, my lady,' said John, and retired.</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Lord,' continued Lady Hazard, 'what could I be
thinking about?'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'What indeed,' said my lord. 'Some∣thing, one
would imagine, not altogether so in∣genuous, by your evident
embarrassment.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'My embarrassment!' answered she,
recollecting her∣self, and then gathering strength from the
conscious∣ness of her integrity, 'no my lord, there is no∣thing
disingenuous in me, as you shall very easily be convinced, when you have
shewn me all that passes in your own heart.'</Q> So saying she left
the room.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'In my heart,' muttered my lord. 'Why
zounds,'</Q>—but seeing Charles he restrained himself. Then
endeavouring to give the matter a different turn, said, with a forced
smile, 
<Q REND="inline">'I suppose your mother is angry at my going
out to breakfast this morn∣ing. She would be prudent however not to threaten
me.'</Q></P>
<P>Here Mr. Standfast came into the room, and the moment my lord
saw him, he exclaimed 
<Q REND="inline">'here I am <PB N="151" REF="186"/> sound.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'And safe I hope my lord,' said
Stand∣fast.</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'I don't know that,' answered the patron; 'but
come with me, I have a great deal to tell you.'</Q></P>
<P>The lord and the tutor now walked out of the room, and Charles
returned to his study; not how∣ever without telling Mr. Standfast he would
not al∣low him to play truant in that manner.</P>
<P>The lord told his friend, as soon as they were in a room by
themselves, that not finding Colonel Tiltly at home, he had been to Mr.
Snaffle's house alone, where he was surprised to find that gentle∣man had
been gone out about an hour, it being then pretty early; 
<Q REND="inline">'and as I knew,' continued my lord, 'that if he
came you would give him a proper an∣swer, I sat down to wait his return. I
had scarcely been there five minutes before his sister came in. Seeing a
stranger, as she imagined, she would have retired, but presently
recollecting me, she paid me some well-bred acknowledgments for the
at∣tention I had the pleasure of paying her last night. I answered this
civility, and gave my visit a turn of enquiring after her health;
complimenting her, at the same time, on the little prejudice her fears had
done her complexion. She lamented her bro∣ther <PB N="152" REF="187"/> was not
at home, but added that she expected him every minute, and begged I would
take break∣fast.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Though I knew my hot-headed gentleman would
only be still more exasperated at finding me tete a tete with his
sister, I resolved to accept her in∣vitation; nor do I repent of my
resolution: for I confess to you I never met with a woman more unaffectedly
captivating. You know Standfast I like a sincere candid openness of
behaviour, and it was never more strongly manifested than in the sweet
manner of this lovely young creature.</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'In the course of our conversation on the
adven∣ture of yesterday evening, I learnt the real cause of that strange
medley of circumstances which in∣troduced a coolness for the first time
between my wife and me, gave me a fresh proof of thy kind
attachment—here Standfast bowed—and brought me in company with
the most lovely woman my eyes ever beheld.</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'I was astonished to find myself a great
deal more concerned in this business than I imagined, though poor thing
she little knew it, but told me the mat∣ter as if to an indifferent person;
imagining my <PB N="153" REF="188"/> conduct last night demanded from her
every ex∣planation.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'You must know this brother of hers is rigidly
tenacious of his sister's honour, for he lies under very great obligations
to this baronet, who is shortly to be married to her; and she, on her
side, partakes so strongly of his generosity, that she consents to
give her hand to a man she cannot love, to pay her brother's debt of
gratitude.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'She told you all this, did she my lord?'
said Sandfast.</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Oh yes,' answered my lord; 'she has none of
that sordid narrowness of mind, the result of vul∣gar sentiments and
mean education. She is all candour and frankness. Oh you may see in a
mo∣ment she has maintained a high rank in society.</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Well, you have been told that the brother very
abruptly left his sister and her intended husband in the box, and
sallied after a gentleman whom he saw coming out on the opposite side.
This man it seems paid some attention to this sweet girl, and was
insulting enough, knowing their circumstances, to propose a settlement.
This the brother resented, and a duel was the conse∣quence: 
<PB N="154" REF="189"/> but no alarming issue came of it; for after a mutual
discharge of pistols, the seconds interfered, and, upon a promise given
by this gen∣tleman, that he would never more presume to ad∣dress Miss
Snaffle, all anger subsided. Last week, however, at the masquerade, if
you recollect, you and I paid particular attention to a lovely figure in the
dress of a circassian, and to confess the truth, while you were gone to
see after our party, I made no scruple to be very free with her; seeing
her entirely alone, and believing her to be one of the frail sisterhood.
She says indeed I took a number of indecent liberties; and faith the fact
might be so, for we had been drinking a great deal of cham∣paigne. All this
Miss Snaffle—for you have seen she was the
circassian—related to her brother, when he returned from seeing
after their car∣riage.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'The brother immediately sought after me,
directed by the description of my dress, all over the rooms, and I dare
say we should have had a tilting bout that evening, had I not, upon joining
you, yielded to your pressing entreaty to return home.</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Not finding me, they had nothing now for it but
conjecture who it could be that had so pub∣licly insulted the lady. The
suspicion naturally <PB N="155" REF="190"/> lighted on the gentleman who had
before affronted her, by his offer of a settlement. Mr. Snaffle therefore
immediately determined upon an expla∣nation with him whenever they should
meet. The first time he saw him was last night at the play, where he
joined him in that sudden manner you have heard of, and they went together
into the Shakespear. Here a very singular explanation took place: the
gentleman informed Mr. Snaffle that he had religiously adhered to the
promise made at the conclusion of their quarrel; that how∣ever he was
entirely devoted to the lady, and meant to make her honourable proposals, the
moment he should, by the death of a very near relation, be released from
the restraint which, till that event happened, would prevent his having so
much hap∣piness; that being nevertheless unalterably at∣tached to her, he
determined, as far as he decently could, to watch her inclinations, and being
that evening at the masquerade, and noticing the par∣ticular conduct of a
gentleman there—meaning me—had the curiosity to enquire who that
gentle∣man was; in which he so well succeeded that I was described as a
reformed rake, who had mar∣ried after ruining a whole village.</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Thus you see, Mr. Snaffle being told all
these particulars, no wonder he should accost me in the 
<PB N="156" REF="191"/> extraordinary manner he did, or that I should find it
necessary to make the handsomest apology for my conduct, which I was on
the point of doing, when I considered how awkward it would be to announce
myself. Besides, it would then have been necessary to inform the lady
of the quarrel, which it was easy to see had been carefully concealed from
her. And again, I did not know whether an apology to her might satisfy her
brother. Be∣sides, to be ingenuous, if I had made a concession, and taken
my leave, it was possible I might never see her again. All these
considerations determined me still to conceal myself; so, after a
thousand acknowledgments for her condescension, I left a message for
the brother, and hastened home to consult thee.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Well my lord,' said Standfast, 'I have
heard you to an end, and once more I caution you not to be imposed upon. In
the first place it is a very curious thing that the lady this morning
should re∣late her love, her poverty, and her gratitude, and the Lord knows
what, to a gentleman she never saw till last night. It puts me too much
in mind of one of the histories of those unfortunate poor devils who always
begin with—I was a clergyman's daughter.'</Q></P>
<P><PB N="157" REF="192"/> 
<Q REND="inline">'Faith,' said my lord, scarcely attending to
Stand∣fast, 'there was one thing escaped her that charmed me. Said
she—I wish I had not gone to that mas∣querade, or else that this
lord was not married, and a rake.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Good God,' cried Standfast, 'cannot you see
it yet? She knew you, and said this on purpose. She thought it would hit,
and so it has. Such a certain shot, so well directed: but surely, my
lord, it was too gross, too palpable, too little dis∣guised to pass on
you?'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Rather say,' returned my lord, 'too ingenuous
to contain the least shadow of art. Besides, every thing around the place
wears the air of sober ele∣gance. A handsome house—'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Hired,' said the tutor, 'for the purpose of
gulling your lordship.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'I cannot conceive,' said Lord Hazard, 'what
makes you so warm in this business. You know the world I acknowledge, but
give me leave to say I know it too, Mr. Standfast.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Infinitely better,' said the parson, with
an in∣ward sneer, 'than I do, my lord, I am ready to grant: but still I am
a by-stander, and as you ap∣pear <PB N="158" REF="193"/> to be playing pretty
deep at this game, there may be no harm in giving you a caution not to be
bubbled.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'I know thy friendship and anxiety,' cried my
lord, 'but what is there to fear? She is a woman of honour, and if I was
inclined to think of her, there is no chance for me. Besides, I give you my
word it is not my intention ever to cause Lady Hazard a moment's
uneasiness:—but surely a beautiful woman may be admired without any
of∣fence to a wife's virtue.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'There my lord,' said Standfast, 'is my
hope: your heart is my sheet anchor: and upon that I trust with comfort for
the safety of your honour.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Enough,' said my lord, 'it shall never
deceive thee, nor any one.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Thank you my lord,' said Standfast; 'I am
completely satisfied: I will not even fear it can deceive itself. And now
pray what sort of an apology do you mean to make to Mr. Snaffle?'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'A full and entire one,' said my lord; 'he is
entitled to it, and so is the lady. You and I will go together to-morrow
morning, and I dare say we shall very easily laugh off the whole
matter.'</Q></P>
<P><PB N="159" REF="194"/> This being agreed on, the conversation
turned on Lady Hazard. Standfast said he conceived there was some apology
due to her. My lord did not think so. He saw in her conduct all the
mysterious inquisitiveness of growing jealousy. It was the first time
to be sure he had ever been disingenuous with her, but circumstances
required it. He now began to perceive there might be occurrences which would
admit of treating her with a sort of laudable dupli∣city; which indeed she
ought to be thankful for:—but such was the restless and
unsatisfied curiosity of wives, that he plainly saw she would
infallibly con∣strue it into coldness and neglect. However, he had seen
many instances of resigned acquiescence in her duty, and therefore he
doubted not but this bu∣siness—the truth of which he was determined
to keep a secret—though it might ruffle a little, yet it would not
destroy their mutual tranquillity.</P>
<P>He thought it, nevertheless, incumbent on him to give the
matter some hue of probability, the bet∣ter to appease her at once. To do
this he told her, as if casually, at dinner, that an affair of honour had
called him out in the morning, but that fortunately every thing had terminated
without bloodshed.</P>
<P>The reflection that her husband had escaped such 
<PB N="160" REF="195"/> a danger, bore down in Lady Hazard's mind all other
considerations, and she was in a moment per∣fectly at ease. She chid him
however for preferring a foolish punctilio of honour to her peace of mind,
and his own personal safety; saying that his courage was too well
established to need any such savage and unnecessary proof of it:
and she wondered a brutal custom should so prevail, which, far from
exhibiting any trait of true honour, or real spirit, was gene∣rally the
refuge of sharping knaves, and the last re∣sort of desperate
cowards.</P>
<P>Standfast acquiesced in the justice of the remark, and
Lord Hazard told her with a smile that, had he known she possessed
so much spirit, he would have engaged her as his second.</P>
<P>A silent minute, or rather a silent quarter of an hour, here
ensued, which would perhaps have lasted much longer had not the arrival of
some company put an end to their different cogitations, the subject of
which, if the reader will but think a little, by way of making one, it is not
impossible but he may be able to guess.</P>
<P>As the conversation now took a mixed turn, and the general
topics of ministers, puppet-shews, ser∣mons, <PB N="161" REF="196"/>
plays, sceptres, wash-balls, lottery tickets, loaded dice, lords, monkies,
speakers, parrots, duchesses, and drabs, were alternately handled with
such velocity and vociferation, that the parties themselves were all
talkers, and no hearers.</P>
<P>I shall therefore content myself with barely men∣tioning
that, while my lord was out of the room, Mr. Standfast asked Lady Hazard
when he should have the honour of communicating the result of what sent
him to the Smyrna.</P>
<P>The lady agreed to hear it the next morning, at which
Standfast said, that then, and every other moment of his life, was
perfectly at the devotion of her ladyship, even though it should be
attended with far greater perils than those he had that day
encountered:—so saying, he heaved a profound sigh, and joined the
company.</P>
<P>What shall I say to the reader in this place? for so far
from relieving him from that suspense into which I have so completely
thrown him, it is certainly my intention to heighten it:—but, however,
there is a remedy for such as are over impatient; for if the tenter-hooks on
which I have set them prick too hard, they have nothing <PB N="162" REF="197"/> to do but dip a few pages forward, and they will find them as easy
as a cushion.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>WHERE THE READER BEING A LITTLE RELIEVED FROM ONE
EMBARRASSMENT WILL BE THROWN INTO ANOTHER.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>No sooner had the complicated din of itinerant retailers
opened the eyes, or rather the ears, of the servants—for they were yet
only half awake—in that square where Lord Hazard resided, than that
noble∣man left the partner of his bed, to seek after Stand∣fast, who was
suddenly awoke by a servant from a nap into which he had fallen about half
an hour be∣fore; for the pious preceptor had been exercising that portion of
his religious duty called watching the greater part of the night.</P>
<P>In fact, the subject which occupied his thoughts was of so
complicate and nice a kind, that he had been turning it in his mind with much
care and at∣tention; and after looking at it in every possible
situation—rejecting this expedient, adopting that, and at last fairly
satisfying himself as to the measures to be taken—he had fallen
asleep just at the very in∣stant when Phoebus awoke, and walked abroad to
cheer the world, inspire poets, and engender ani∣malculae: 
<PB N="164" REF="199"/> three employments, according to some philosophers
equally material.</P>
<P>Mr. Standfast understanding that his patron re∣quired his
presence, now only muttered those curses which he before had been
thundering against the footman. In a few minutes he joined Lord Ha∣zard, whom
he found full of impatience and anxiety.</P>
<P>My lord said he wanted to have five minutes con∣versation
with him previous to their intended busi∣ness that morning; adding, that he
must candidly confess he wished for a pretext for continuing his visits
at Mr. Snaffle's, and that he could think of nothing but the sister.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'My lord,' said Standfast, 'I am sorry to
see this. It can end but one way. Good God that this Sy∣ren should get
such hold of you in a moment!—Why the most inexperienced of your
adventures at Little Hockley was prudence to this.'</Q></P>
<P>He had scarcely spoken when Lady Hazard came abruptly into
the room. Addressing herself to her husband, she said, 
<Q REND="inline">'My lord, I know not how you will receive the
over anxious solicitude of a wife, whose uniform study has been to
administer to your wishes; but I am impelled, by an irresista∣ble 
<PB N="165" REF="200"/> something, to entreat that the horrid coolness you
have shewn me ever since that strange busi∣ness at the playhouse,
may be fully explained; may be done away: that so the tranquillity which
reigned in this family, till that unhappy moment, and pointed us out as fit and
worthy objects for imitation may be restored to us.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'I know not what you mean,' said my
lord.—You are a charming woman; I doat on you:—therefore make
yourself easy, and trust to the truth of my affection.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Heaven forbid I should doubt it,' said the
lady; 'but be assured the best affections are too often en∣dangered by
the slightest misunderstandings. I believe we have all three a great
deal to confess to each other, and I came to encourage you both, by frankly
acknowledging all I know and all I con∣jecture, relative to the most
extraordinary and most unpleasant business I ever yet experienced; at
the same time, my lord, let me say I have no idle curiosity to indulge,
no whim to gratify, no foolish feminine fears that alarm me, not even the
slightest want of confidence in your lordship's lavish love or firm
fidelity;—I honestly and sa∣credly believe that nothing could shake
either;—but, as an artful train of flattering concurrent cir∣cumstances
<PB N="166" REF="201"/> might give them, strong as they are, some slight
inclination to pause, I think it my duty to endeavour what I can, to
sustain them, to hold them securely where they ought, and where I am
sure they wish invariably to fix.'</Q></P>
<P>My lord paid his lady a very elegant, and I be∣lieve a very
sincere compliment, on her inten∣tions, attachment, affection, sense of
duty, and right conception of that exquisite charm in a wife's con∣duct who
is never officiously solicitous, but ever on the watch to please. He
remarked however that the breakfast would interrupt nothing.</P>
<P>Here Standfast interfering, said, that at breakfast
Charles would necessarily make one of the party, which he apprehended was
not Lady Hazard's wish; he therefore proposed to defer it till the evening,
or some other time, which the lady peremptorily declared she could not
consent to. Indeed she pressed so hard for a hearing that very
morning, that Standfast, at the instance of my Lord Hazard, un∣dertook to
set his pupil a task in the library imme∣diately after breakfast, when it
was agreed that the conversation should be resumed.</P>
<P>Perhaps Mr. Standfast was glad of a moment's pause. He
certainly betrayed evident symptoms of <PB N="167" REF="202"/>
astonishment at the first part of Lady Hazard's harrangue, which, added
to an affected indif∣ference, and a forced sprightliness, would have
con∣veyed to an uninterrupted by-stander, a trait or two of suspicion
that the lady's conduct was not altoge∣ther agreeable to him: but we have
already hinted that he never suffered long under perturbation of any kind.
Thus, whatever inward sensations might produce the above effects, they
certainly did not re∣main visible long enough to be noticed either by the
lord or the lady; and with the assistance of sum∣moning his pupil to
breakfast, he had so rallied his spirits, that he appeared the most
cheerful and un∣concerned of the whole company.</P>
<P>It was far otherwise with my lord. He set it down for a
certainty that his lady had, by some means, discovered all that had past,
and divined all that was likely to come. Nevertheless, he felt no reluctance
to review his intentions either in one light or the other; but certain
nameless sensations, which he felt in spight of himself gave his
behaviour an awkwardness which was apparent in proportion as he endeavoured
to hide it.</P>
<P>Charles was no sooner informed by his father that he had
some particular business with Mr. Standfast, and given his task, than
he retired to the library, <PB N="168" REF="203"/> when the lady, after an
apology much in the style of the former one, acquainted her husband with
all she knew relative to this strange affair: not even omitting either the
insult she had received the morn∣ing before, the spirited kindness of
Standfast, or the message she had sent after him to the Smyrna; which
last business clearly accounted for her consu∣sion in the library
when John came back; whom she also loaded with praises, in which
Standfast joined, declaring, at the same time, that the hiring of that
worthy fellow was a new instance that Lord Hazard's knowledge of the world
and judgment of mankind was superior to his, for that John had what he
thought a forbidding countenance, which his lordship, however, with a
penetration far be∣yond his, had construed into a sign of bluntness and
plain dealing. 
<Q REND="inline">'But madam,' said Standfast, 'I interrupt
you.'</Q></P>
<P>The lady went on, saying that her husband's new and
extraordinary conduct had first given her the alarm. In addition to this, a
servant had been privy to the treatment she had received from the baronet
at the theatre. Again, he who ought to have pro∣tected her was out of the way,
when Mr. Standfast stept forward in her defence. In short, such
con∣cealments and such obligations were very repug∣nant to her delicacy,
which she hoped his lordship, <PB N="169" REF="204"/> in this case, would
conceive was not affected or over∣strained. My lord, she added, was the
proper per∣son to reward the servant and thank Mr. Standfast, who, though
a gentleman in years, and perfectly exemplary in his manners, was by no means a
pro∣per confident for her who thought it her first hap∣piness to have no
wish or thought concealed from her husband.</P>
<P>Lord Hazard passed some very high compliments on the
frankness, kindness, and great propriety of his lady's declaration and
conduct. He owned he thought the business of the baronet perfectly
inex∣plicable; but these and all other considerations were swallowed up
in the obligations he thought himself under to Standfast, who took all
these com∣pliments with the same composure as he would have received his
salary, or any thing else which he con∣ceived to be perfectly his own
property.</P>
<P>His lordship desired this worthy friend, as he called him,
to relate the issue of his meeting the baronet at the Smyrna; but
Standfast remarked that the harvest of domestic tranquillity this
discovery promised, belonged entirely to his lordship and the amiable
Lady Hazard; that at best he was but a privileged gleaner, who saw, but
envied not, that abundant happiness which kindly let fall as much 
<PB N="170" REF="205"/> comfort as he desired, and more, infinitely more than
he deserved:—he therefore begged to come in his place. 
<Q REND="inline">'Besides,' added he, 'totally ignorant as your
lordship is of the motives of these people for stirring up all this
mischief, your story cannot but involve some awkwardness which my after
ex∣planation may relieve; for I fancy the baronet has made me more <HI>au
fait</HI> to this business than either of you.'</Q></P>
<P>His lordship, taking this as a friendly hint of the tutor, to
clear up any embarrassment that might arise in his narrative, consented
to unfold. It is but truth to say that his relation was not so ingenu∣ous
as that of his lady had been; for he did not mention the cause of the
quarrel, nor that it yet existed; but, on the contrary, said that the whole
was a mistake, the brother having taken him for another person, who had, it
seems, offered an insult to the sister, and that every thing was
amicably made up. He sunk entirely the circumstance of his having seen
Miss Snaffle the day before; he also forbore to touch on his intention of
paying that lady a second visit; and indeed on any one point that could
give the smallest reason for conjecture that the whole was any other than
a matter of a common cursory kind, which, in proportion as it was
mys∣terious, so it sunk to nothing, the mystery being 
<PB N="171" REF="206"/> cleared away. He was very much alive however to all
those matters relative to Sir Daniel Dogbolt.—He hoped his friend would
be able to clear them up: for, after all, he should not consider that part
of the business at an end without a full and explicit sa∣tisfaction for
the insult his wife had sustained in his absence.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'I am heartily sorry you were absent,'
said Stand∣fast. 'Proud as I was of chastising his insolence, it was
certainly your right.'</Q></P>
<P>Lord Hazard acknowledged his obligations, and proceeded to
finish his account of this business, in which, upon the whole, he so
well succeeded, that Lady Hazard declared she was, except a little
re∣maining curiosity, perfectly satisfied.</P>
<P>Now came the tutor's turn. He began with say∣ing he had a much
longer tale to tell than either of them, and that since he was not then bound
by the painful duty which had hitherto punctiliously kept him from divulging
it, he thought himself obliged openly and without reserve to declare all he
knew on the subject. 
<Q REND="inline">'But,' added he, 'I believe my lord they are too
artful a set for us to place any reliance on what they tell us. What I am
going now to inform you, I forced from the pretty ba∣ronet—if 
<PB N="172" REF="207"/> he be one—who had the unparalleled insolence to
insult this lady, for which—and I hope your lordship will not blame
my too forward zeal, I had the honour of calling him to account.</Q></P>
<P>Standfast here received the compliments he had once more
fished for, and then went on: not with∣out first exclaiming 
<Q REND="inline">'Heavens! why my lord a per∣fect stranger
would have been entitled to the as∣sistance I gave, much less her
ladyship. A meer common exercise of humanity. Besides, the gen∣tleman
gave me very little trouble. He fences pretty well, but I soon disarmed
him; and having his life in my power, I made use of this oppor∣tunity of
extorting from him an account of him∣self and his associates. He said
he had long se∣cretly admired Lady Hazard, that he had tried many experiments
to get an opportunity of dis∣closing his passion, but found none which
had the smallest appearance of feasibility till about three weeks ago, at
the masquerade, where you may remember we were in a very large
party.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Good God,' cried Lady Hazard, 'I recollect it.
A man certainly did teaze me at the masque∣rade, but I took it for some
drunken fool, and never gave the matter a second thought.'</Q></P>
<P><PB N="173" REF="208"/> 
<Q REND="inline">'He told me,' said Standfast, he first
accosted your lordship, drew you away from your com∣pany, and introduced
you to another, that he might have better opportunity to entertain her
ladyship. His words were that he had found an impregnable fortress, and
therefore, from that moment, de∣termined to give up the attack; but accident
in∣troducing him into the same box at the playhouse, his wishes revived,
and resolving to make use of the occasion that presented itself
through Mr. Snaffle's quarrel with the gentleman in the oppo∣site box, he
dropt him in the crowd, and returned to Lady Hazard just as your lordship
had gone to conduct Miss Snaffle to her coach. He confessed that, to
ingratiate himself, he had told her lady∣ship several falsities, such
as that you my lord had an intimacy with Miss Snaffle, that you were then
gone home with her, all which we have already heard. In short, first making
him answer many other questions, I gave him his life, and suffered him to
leave me, after he had protested in the most solemn manner that he would
never dare to mention the name of this lady in future upon any account
whatever.</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Well, my lord, these are the facts: now hear
my comments on them. This man is not a baro∣net, <PB N="174" REF="209"/> neither
is he upon the point of marrying this young lady, nor are they any other than
three sharpers, who have in some way or other a dark plot on the conjugal
peace of your worthy lady and yourself. This Sir Daniel did draw you aside
from your company, and introduced you to this very Miss Snaffle: with what
design is another matter: but it is very extraordinary you should be left
by this baronet with his intended wife, that he might the better introduce
himself to Lady Hazard.—Nor am I mistaken as to the lady, for I heard
a chair called in her name.</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'You cannot forget my lord that we at that time
decided that she was a woman of no character. I remember your saying with
great earnestness, Stand∣fast, let us not pay Lady Hazard so ill a
compli∣ment as to speak to a creature of this stamp;—though she is
under the same roof with her.</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Well, my lord, can it be, after what I have
said, that this is a woman of honour? that her brother is a man of the
nicest feelings? and that Sir Daniel Dogbolt is on the point of marriage with
this woman? No, my lord, it is, as I said, a plot against you; however,
thank heaven, armed with a proper confidence in each other, you may despise
it.'</Q></P>
<P><PB N="175" REF="210"/> 
<Q REND="inline">'Mr. Standfast has placed this matter in its
true light,' said the lady. 'For my part, I am per∣fectly at ease, and I am
sure my lord will thank me for waving all absurd delicacy, and coming to
this declaration.'</Q></P>
<P>Here several suitable remarks were made, Mr. Standfast was
loaded with thanks, and the most per∣fect harmony was restored. After this
the lady re∣tired to her dressing room, and left the two friends
together.</P>
<P>They were no sooner alone than Lord Hazard be∣gan anew to
compliment and thank Mr. Standfast. That gentleman assured his patron his
thanks were more than he deserved; and indeed he spoke truth. However, no
one upon earth could have bel eved his conduct to be any other than cordial
zeal and sin∣cere friendship; conformable to which appearances, he said
he would not leave his lordship till he had made him a firm promise not to
see that woman any more, who he must now very plainly perceive was a
suborned wretch, to assist in some vile plot against his domestic
peace.</P>
<P>My lord did not hesitate to make this promise; for he was
charmed with the angel-like conduct of <PB N="176" REF="211"/> his lady, and
went so far as to say that, seeing the matter now in the same light
with the tutor, he felt himself at ease with relation to Sir Daniel
Dogbolt, as well as the rest. Standfast hearing this, and being told that
his kindness should not go unremembered, went, with the greatest air of
satisfaction to seek his pupil.</P>
<P>As the single articles in my account with the rea∣der begin
again to be pretty numerous, I shall now, for his satisfaction, add them
up, and carry them over. To speak without metaphor, Mr. Standfast please
to unmask.</P>
<P>The preceptor then had, in conjunction with Vi∣ney, concerted
this whole scheme. The masque∣rade, the playhouse, the interview, and
every other part of it, was as regularly digested as the trial of a felon
before he comes to the bar at the Old Bailey. Mr. Viney had tutored the
gentleman, and Mrs. O'Shocknesy had instructed the lady.</P>
<P>Standfast, however, who had contrived the whole plot, was
totally unknown to any of the actors in it. His argument with Viney and Mrs.
O'Shocknesy was, that as they enjoyed the utmost they ever could expect
from Lord Hazard, they had no measures <PB N="177" REF="212"/> to keep with
him; especially as ever so violent a rupture could not deprive either him
of his living, or her of her annuity. On the contrary, that he, Standfast,
might in a moment lose both his salary and his expectations, which were not
trifles. He therefore stipulated not to be seen at all, but in their privy
council; and instructions were particularly given to the under villains to be
more cautious in deceiving him than any other of the family.</P>
<P>This master stroke could be worthy of no other than
Standfast. To teach his tools to look upon him as their enemy, secured him
from all possibility of detection; for he knew he might laugh at the
re∣sentment of Viney, even if he had any cause to sus∣pect him of
treachery: his own <HI>ipfe dixit</HI> being al∣ways sufficient to overturn
any thing of that kind with his patron. Nay, notwithstanding this
infor∣mation, the reader is almost obliged to confess that he is innocent;
for his conduct gives the lie direct even to what I have advanced of him. It is
very true that we have seen him act the part of a disinte∣rested friend,
we have heard him counsel Lord Ha∣zard to shun that very plot he himself
had laid for him, and one would think he had so far succeeded against
himself—if I may be allowed the expres∣sion—that these
swindlers in love seem to be turned out of employ: the gentlemen to hunt
other game <PB N="178" REF="213"/> at the hazard table, or perhaps on the
highway, and the lady to ruin apprentices, or gull libidinous elders.</P>
<P>If the reader thinks thus of Mr. Standfast, he is not yet half
acquainted with that consummate fabri∣cator of domestic ruin. A simple
intrigue, and the common incidental train of disquietude attending it, would
not have been a luxury inexorable enough for him. In short, Mr. Standfast,
put on your mask again; for we will not see your naked heart till we are
prepared to pronounce, by a knowledge of the species of destruction it
meditates—that in the round of human conception there is not so
shocking a piece of deformity as a complete hypocrite.</P>

<PB REF="214"/>
<HEAD>CHAPTER VI.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>SEVERAL LETTERS, MORE PLOT AND INTRIGUE, AND SOME OF IT FROM A
VERY UNEXPECTED QUARTER.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE day on which this eclaircissement took place was
distinguished by the cheerfulness that sat on every countenance. Indeed
so remarkable was the prevalent good humour, that Mr. Standfast was
heartily joined by a great deal of company, who dined at my lord's, when he
ventured an opinion that Hazard house had the only roof in town that could
boast of a couple perfectly elegant and per∣fectly happy. I do not pretend to
assert that this declaration was truth; I only say the company then
present allowed it to be so.</P>
<P>My lord would not read a single letter—for many were
that day brought him—lest it should give a tinge of
dissatisfaction that might check the general hilarity. They were all
ordered to be laid in the study, and it was agreed that he and Standfast
should look them over the next morning.</P>
<P>The whole day being like a smooth sea, which looked the more
beautiful for having been a little <PB N="180" REF="215"/> ruffled, we will
glide over it, as too uniform for any striking remarks, and come to the next,
which was a little more agitated.</P>
<P>As soon as breakfast was over, his lordship and
Standfast, according to agreement, retired to ex∣amine the letters. These
were seven in number, and as four of them in some degree relate to this
history, I shall insert them, together with the remarks of their
examiners. Indeed it was once in my head to have given this whole history
through that ve∣hicle, but I considered that making my personages retire to
their closets before they disclosed their sen∣timents would have thrown
a frigidity over the bu∣siness; besides the unavoidable necessity of
relating every thing two or three times over, and always partially. Besides I
may introduce some characters who cannot write, and others who will not. Mr.
Standfast, for instance, would not have been pos∣sessed of half the
cunning I have given him if any thing could have induced him to disclose
his senti∣ments upon paper.</P>
<P>Upon reflection, therefore, I was determined not to follow a
method, however fashionable, by which I must have made villains confide
their vices, and young ladies their wishes—which, if they felt
deli∣cately, they would find difficult to express at all, 
<PB N="181" REF="216"/> much less in a letter—to their confidants and
clerks of the roads.</P>
<P>All such matters considered, I have left these
penny-post men in biography to themselves, con∣tented to jog on an old
road, where what the pros∣pects want of trimming and regulation, will, I
trust, be made up in simple and natural luxuriance. But to the letters
under examination. 
<LETTER>
<HEAD>LETTER I.</HEAD>
<HEAD>TO THE RIGHT HON. LORD HAZARD.</HEAD>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P> The letter I now send you is accompanied by one from your
son, who is determined to chuse a guardian—being eighteen years of
age—unless you intend to do him more justice.</P>
<P> You have withdrawn your protection from him, in favour of
your darling Charles, whom the vir∣tuous Mr. Standfast is training in the
paths of honour.</P>
<P> I shall forbear to reflect on either him, you, your 
<PB N="182" REF="217"/> lady, or her offspring: it is enough that I know you
all. I only ask at present—which will deter∣mine to whom my son
shall look in future as a protector—that you will make over to me that
part of the estate in Warwickshire which includes the mansion, and the
farm contiguous to it; in which case neither Zekiel nor I shall be further
troublesome to you: but contentedly make his two hundred a year and my three
serve us till that happy moment when it shall please fate to unite your
lordly bones to the skins of your ancestors.</P>

O'SHOCKNESY.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER></P>
<P>Standfast having thanked the lady for her glance at him, and
my lord having laughed heartily at the good natured reflection on his
extraction, in the latter part of the letter, they passed on to the next,
which contained what follows. 
<LETTER>
<HEAD>LETTER II.</HEAD>
<HEAD>TO THE RIGHT HON. LORD HAZARD.</HEAD>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>MY LORD AND FATHER,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P> For so I believe you are; at least you could 
<PB N="183" REF="218"/> not prove to the contrary, and that's enough for me to
know I shall inherit in spight of my bro∣ther Charles. But, however, as I
don't want to be undutiful, I shall only tell you this: I am sick of Eton;
I'd rather follow a pack of hounds; and so d'ye see I have desired mother
to make you a proposial concerning Warwickshire. If so be you like to
agree to it, its very well: if not, I am de∣termined to look out for a
guardian; being now, as a body may say, pretty far gone towards years of
discretion. So I remain</P>
<CLOSER>
<SIGNED>Your dutiful son, And servant to command,
RUST.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'What could a guardian do?' said my
lord.—</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Faith be very troublesome,' replied
Standfast. 'These estates in tail, without right of waste, are, of all
legal niceties, the best morsel for a litigious stomach. As to what the
lady and her son want, your lordship knows best whether it is worth
con∣tending for; but I think I would not be bullied out of any thing.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Well, we will consider what is to be done,'
said his lordship; 'in the mean time let us to the next.'</Q> 
<PB N="184" REF="219"/> So saying, he opened another letter, which came by the
post, and was written by Sir Sidney Roebuck. These were the contents. 
<LETTER>
<HEAD>LETTER III.</HEAD>
<HEAD>TO THE RIGHT HON. LORD HAZARD.</HEAD>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P> I take the liberty to write to you concerning your village
of Little Hockley, which, since the absence of your lordship, and the
death of Major Malplaquet, has risen to such maturity in singular and
enormous vice as I sincerely hope cannot be paralleled.</P>
<P> I have been obliged to be at the pains of ex∣erting
myself very strenuously in my capacity of magistrate, but smugglers,
marauders, and other lawless characters, for whom this vile place is be∣come
a remarkable asylum, are difficult to deal with. My first idea was, in
conjunction with the members for the county, to beg the interference of
parliament; but, conceiving that much delicacy was due to your lordship in
this business, I beg previously to consult you.</P>
<P><PB N="185" REF="220"/> If you will treat for the village,
or, should that be incompatible with the conditions of your in∣heritance, if
you will lease it to me, perhaps I may be able to bring about a
reformation.</P>
<P> I have no doubt but your lordship will rejoice in
forwarding a work so dear to the interest of hu∣manity, and should be
happy to receive your im∣mediate answer, as I wish to make some
arrange∣ments at Castlewick, agreeable to the result of this application,
before I attend my duty at the house, when I shall have the honour to call
on your lordship, with a view to a further conference on this subject.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>I am, My Lord, Your Lordship's Most
obedient Servant, S. W. ROEBUCK.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER></P>
<P>Lord Hazard, as I formerly mentioned, received his rents
regularly from his steward, and therefore did not dream of the enormities
carried on at Little Hockley. He now first reflected that these seeds of
vice he had himself sown; and as wickedness, like weeds, flourishes
best where there are no whole∣some plants to interrupt its growth, he
easily per∣ceived <PB N="186" REF="221"/> and felt the truth of Sir Sidney's
relation; and, therefore, determined to acquaint him that he was as well
disposed as himself to perfect so desira∣ble an undertaking, and that
he should be glad to see him for that purpose.</P>
<P>After examining another letter or two, they came to the
following one. 
<LETTER>
<HEAD>LETTER IV.</HEAD>
<HEAD>TO THE RIGHT HON. LORD HAZARD.</HEAD>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P> As you have thought proper to take no notice of what
passed the other evening, when I had the honour of calling your lordship
scoundrel, I sup∣pose you acquiesce in the justice of the
term:—I shall therefore, in future, speak of you as of a wretch
deserving pity, and though a lord, beneath the notice of a gentleman.</P>
<CLOSER>
<SIGNED>I am, &amp;c. PETER SNAFFLE.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Oh,' said my lord, 'this is too shocking to
pass. I must break the fellow's bones.'</Q></P>
<P><PB N="187" REF="222"/> 
<Q REND="inline">'Rather get a chairman to do it,' said
Standfast. Did not you wait at the rascal's house two hours? Where was he
all that time? No, no, they think you begin to smell the matter out, and so
are grown desperate. Does not all this confirm my suspicions?'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'But still,' said my lord, 'there is
something cursedly unpleasant in letting such a scoundrel go on with
impunity. I am determined,' conti∣nued he, 'to give him manuel chastisement
where∣ever I meet him.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Not at all,' cried Standfast, 'till he has
esta∣blished his credentials to dispute a point of honour with your
lordship.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Well, well, perhaps you are right,' said my
lord, 'you generally see things very properly. Let us talk no more of the
damned fellow; he has set my blood in a ferment.'</Q></P>
<P>The conversation was interrupted by a note from Ingot, in the
city, with whom—as the reader for∣merly heard from Mr.
Standfast—Lord Hazard sometimes banked. The letter was concerning the
transfer of some stock, and other business, on which he required to
see his lordship at an early opportu∣nity; and my lord, as he was anxious
to advise with <PB N="188" REF="223"/> counsel what was best to be done
with Mrs. O'Shock∣nesy and her son, thought he could not take a pro∣perer
time than the present.</P>
<P>As his lordship went alone into the city, he had leisure to
revolve in his mind the various business of the day, and in particular the
subject of the letter from Snaffle, which he did not enter into much be∣fore
Mr. Standfast: knowing that an inclination to indulge his feelings would meet
with every possible opposition from that careful friend.</P>
<P>At the same time, however, that he gave Stand∣fast credit
for the goodness of his intentions, he could not help thinking the
conjectures of that gen∣tleman rather prescient than wise, careful than
certain. What was all this mighty business? Why truly a hot-headed fellow
had insulted him with great acrimony, and written to him with great
im∣pertinence. What were Standfast's ideas of this matter? That a plot was
laid to disturb his domestic repose. In truth it appeared so by the
assault on his lady, and looked something like it by the tempting
opportunity that had been given him of addressing a very beautiful woman.
Well, it was so perhaps: in that case the proper check had been given to
the first; and, as to the latter, he could see no ruinous 
<PB N="189" REF="224"/> consequences that would ensue, even were they to
carry their scheme into execution. He could not be drawn into a marriage, and
therefore an intrigue was the worst that could be apprehended. This it was
his business to avoid; and he certainly should do so: but was this any
reason why he must put up with a most provoking and impudent affront? No,
no; he must beg leave to understand the etiquette of his own honour as well
as Mr. Standfast. He was no school boy, and therefore took the liberty to
dis∣sent from the necessity of having his actions eternally
inspected; and as to the affront, which he neither could nor would brook, a
proper time should cer∣tainly be taken to resent it.</P>
<P>Lord Hazard had now arrived to that very pitch where Standfast
wished to conduct him. The tutor knew that no longer to confide in him was
the only way to keep him safe from all consequences. He waited with
malicious joy for the moment when the patron would voluntarily exclaim, Oh that
I had taken thy advice! Oh that thy salutary counsel had been
followed!—and I say to the reader, woe be to Lord Hazard if ever the
moment should arrive when such an exclamation shall be necessary. But
at pre∣sent let us change the scene.</P>
<P>In the course of his lordship's business with Mr. 
<PB N="190" REF="225"/> Ingot, a lady passed through the room, whom he
remarked spoke nothing but French; for there were two gentlemen with her, one
of whom told Mr. Ingot, in very broken English, that the lady wished him a
good morning.</P>
<P>After they were gone, Ingot told my lord that there was
something singular in the lady's story, which had been so interwoven
with a business con∣cerning money he had been recommended to trans∣act
for her, that he could not but be perfectly ac∣quainted with it.</P>
<P>My lord, who had never any improper curiosity, seemed very
indifferent about hearing it; saying there were family matters in it not
proper to be divulged.</P>
<P>Ingot assured my lord that was not the case at all; on the
contrary, he should tell it to every one he knew; because it placed in a
more glaring point of view the scandalous traffic and shameful selling
and buying of consciences among the papists (a sect it seems for which
Mr. Ingot had a great inveteracy) than any instance that had ever come within
his knowledge.</P>
<P>My Lord smiled, and Mr. Ingot continued.— 
<PB N="191" REF="226"/> 
<Q REND="inline">'This lady, when she was very young, having
un∣fortunately an intrigue with a stranger her father had a great aversion
to, she was secluded in a con∣vent, but what convent her lover never could
learn. After some time, being persuaded by her friends that her enamorato
had played her false, she was prevailed on to take the veil, and shut
herself up, as every one thought, for ever.</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'About a year and a half ago her father died in
England, having long repented of his daughter's ill treatment, and made a will,
leaving her his whole fortune, all vested in the English funds. Mind the
conditions: to be spent in France, half for her own use, and half in pious
donations—provided a dis∣pensation of her vow could be obtained: but,
in default of this, to go to English charities.</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Here was manifest the cunning of the
Frenchman. He thought, and rightly too, the pious donations in France would
procure interest enough to obtain the dispensation of her vow. Ay, ay,
the Pope shall make a bargain with any Jew in Duke's-place.</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'The dispensation was obtained, with this
single proviso—which indeed grasped at the whole
for∣tune—that she should live pensioner in the same convent, with
liberty to go out when she pleased.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="192" REF="227"/> 
<Q REND="inline">'These terms the lady accepted, and giving
secu∣rity for her return, she was permitted to come to England, in company
with a person deputed by the convent, to arrange her father's affairs. This
she has now done, and, in a week or ten days will return to France.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'An extraordinary business indeed,' said
Lord Hazard.</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Yes, yes,' replied Ingot, with great
arch∣ness; 'the church of Rome never fails to stretch its prerogative when
interest is in the case. How happy are we who live under the three
estates and the protestant religion?'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Spoken as a citizen should speak,' said
my lord. 'Poor lady, I dare say she rejoices at her escape from
captivity. What does she think of En∣gland?'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Oh she knows nobody here,' cried Ingot.
'Ex∣cept one gentleman, she has not enquired for a single creature. How
she came to know him is a mystery to me. It is Sir Sidney Roebuck. I have
promised to find him out for her if he be in town.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Then I can tell you, Mr. Ingot, that he is
not,' answered my lord. 'I received a letter from him this very morning,
which induces me to think it will be a fortnight first; as he only talks of
com∣ing <PB N="193" REF="228"/> up by the meeting of parliament.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Well, well, she will not see him then,'
cried Ingot:—it is no great matter I suppose.'</Q></P>
<P>Here the conversation drew to an end; the lord testifying
great pleasure at the lady's emancipation from confinement, and the citizen
reprobating the folly of immuring healthy young girls, who ought to increase
their species, and produce soldiers and sailors, and thanking his stars
that he did not live under the influence of an Italian priest, not half so
good a citizen as himself; a fellow who, because he wore a triple crown,
could roast and barbecue any of his peaceable subjects whenever he
pleased, the better to confiscate their fortunes.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER VII.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>THE LAST SUBJECT FOLLOWED UP—A LETTER FROM EMMA, AND
OTHER IMPORTANT MATTER.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THAT very afternoon Lord Hazard wrote an an∣swer to Sir
Sidney's letter, the receipt of which gave the baronet such satisfaction,
that it hastened his journey to town, where in a few days he arrived; for his
concerns were always in so regular a state, that he could at any time leave
them with very short preparation: and Lady Roebuck, who was of all women
living the properest wife for such a man, never required much warning to
follow him through all his duties; for such he conceived every one of his
pursuits. It was a duty to discharge all trusts, to answer all letters,
to return all visits: but then he took care to undertake nothing but what he
could conveniently do, to receive no visits but from those he liked, and to
reject all unnecessary or imperti∣nent correspondents. It was also with
him a duty to be merry, and to make others so; and he could with equal
ease—ay, and without any deviation from his illustrious extraction,
which I have already said he was pretty proud of—walk a minuet with a 
<PB N="195" REF="230"/> duchess, on a birth-night, or crack a facetious jest
with a cobler. He might be termed an elegant oddity; and to his peculiarities,
for they were all amiable, did his lady accommodate herself.</P>
<P>Before they set out it was agreed to leave the faith∣ful Emma
with little Annette, who had nearly reached her fourteenth year, and was grown
a most beautiful young creature. Lady Roebuck loved her with an interesting
and lively tenderness. She had watched her growing perfections with at
least ma∣ternal care; for had she been twenty times her own daughter, she
could not have paid more attention to her education, or felt more pleasure at
those dawning accomplishments with which she promised to be remarkably
gifted.</P>
<P>Emma said she had perused her little mind with profound
attention, and though she was no further than the introduction, it was
prefaced with a pro∣mise of such delightful matter as could not fail to
charm the hearts of all readers. She could discern that the subject was
interesting, the moral instruc∣tive, and that goodness and virtue were
strongly in∣culcated in every page.</P>
<P>Annette and Emma then, and the whole village of Castlewick
were left under the care of the good <PB N="196" REF="231"/> Mildman, who had
not suffered at all in the opinion of Sir Sidney, for having been turned into
a scare∣crow for the amusement of the Hockleyites.</P>
<P>Sir Sidney and his lady arrived in town, at the period above
mentioned; and a card was almost in∣stantly dispatched to Lord Hazard,
purporting that the baronet intended to pay him a visit in a day or two, to
talk over the business of Little Hockley.</P>
<P>The peer and the baronet soon came to an eligible agreement;
and as leases and title deeds were obliged to be consulted in great plenty,
during the course of this negociation, a sort of cordiality grew between
the lessor and lessee. Sir Sidney acknowledged there was great
fairness and candour in the conduct of the peer, and facetiously remarked
he was glad to see so good an understanding between the upper and lower
house. As to my lord, he looked up to Sir Sidney as a being of a superior
kind, and while he penetrated his amiable and benignant views, his only wonder
was that every man of ample possessions did not do the same, since
his reward was so certain and so immense.</P>
<P>The ladies, who I have more than once remarked were to their
husbands what an echo is to the voice, had also commenced something more
than an ac∣quaintance; <PB N="197" REF="232"/> which both the husbands
strongly re∣commended. Indeed this intimacy had well nigh brought about a
breach of the bargain between Lord Hazard and Sir Sidney; for the latter had
proposed to the peer to wave signing the writings, and take upon himself
the arrangements of Little Hockley. However, whether my lord felt the
su∣periority of Sir Sidney's qualifications for such an undertaking,
whether he thought it ridiculous to expect a harvest of virtue where he had
only planted vice; whatever in short was the motive, he agreed only to return
to Warwickshire with Sir Sidney, and give him possession of his
bargain, by which means the families would pass some months in the
society of each other.</P>
<P>Even this was some acquisition, and Sir Sidney, in hopes of
enticing his lordship to follow his ex∣ample, eagerly catched at the
proposal. Schemes of pleasure to be executed in the following spring and
summer engrossed much of their conversation. Besides, Lady Hazard was
with child, and it was thought the country would be likely to restore her
strength, after she should have lain in; for she was in general very
ill upon those occasions, and had never since Charles had a
child—though she had borne in all four—that did not, after its
birth, pine away, and at length die.</P>
<P><PB N="198" REF="233"/> Pleasures were also chalked out for
Charles and Annette, who was understood to be Sir Sidney's daughter by a
former marriage, but that her mo∣ther died abroad; and the baronet did not
spare to hint that an union between the prince and princess of the two
rival villages might perhaps cement the general amnesty between all
parties.</P>
<P>It will be easily seen that Standfast felt awkward in this
society. He too well knew Lady Roebuck's prudence, to suppose that she
had acquainted Sir Sidney with any of his tricks, and as there seemed no
coolness on the part of the baronet, these con∣jectures were confirmed.
Thus, supposing the bu∣siness would be concluded in a short time
between his patron and Sir Sidney, he was so far perfectly at ease; but
when he found the ladies were to be con∣sulted, he trembled for the
consequence. How to act? Suppose he tried to prevent their meeting? but
that was dangerous and difficult. He once thought of hinting at a distance
that something had actually passed between him and the lady, which, if
credited, would account for any rancour in her; but, upon maturer reflection,
any of these would be to desert his own grand principle, which was, to be
always prepared with expedients, but never to use them except in cases of
emergency. It would be enough to defend himself when he should be
at∣tacked; <PB N="199" REF="234"/> and all things considered, since the lady
had evidently kept the grand point a secret from Sir Sidney, it was
possible, though barely so, that she would not tattle to any one
else: yet that cursed female vanity—In short, the gentleman's
combat with himself continued a considerable while, till at length the
result was that he should make an ex∣cuse to go out of town for a month,
and by that means gather from Lord Hazard's letters what was going forward.
Besides he had another reason for taking this resolution—indeed he
had several reasons—which will in due time appear to the
reader:—so, having imparted his intention to my lord, and got
permission for Charles to accompany him, the tutor and the pupil set out
for the west of England, where business of a particular nature demanded
their pre∣sence.</P>
<P>Thus, most of the arrangements before related passed in
the absence of Standfast and Charles, whom, as their excursion has
something remarkable in it, we will join: after I have related a matter that
cur∣sorily passed between the two ladies.</P>
<P>They were talking of Annette, and Lady Sidney, who was by no
means ashamed of confessing so much of the truth as saved the honour
of Miss Le Clerc, mentioned the matter exactly as it happened, simply 
<PB N="200" REF="235"/> with the addition of their being privately married. 
<Q REND="inline">'But,' said Lady Hazard, 'are you sure that
the mother is dead?'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Sure!' said Lady Roebuck, 'what doubt can
there be of that? Besides, at any rate, she is dead to the world.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Perhaps not,' said the other lady. 'Good God,
have you any reason for what you say?'</Q> cried Lady Roebuck. Lady Hazard
here made a very serious apology for her imprudence, saying, the great
similarity between the story she had heard from her ladyship, and one
recently told her by my lord, had struck her so for∣cibly, that she had
unwarily betrayed herself into those unguarded expressions.</P>
<P>This redoubled Lady Roebuck's anxiety, and she entreated, in
the most earnest manner, to know what all this mystery meant. 
<Q REND="inline">'Nay,' said Lady Hazard, if it be as I
conjecture, it must be known, for the lady is determined to see Sir Sidney
before she leaves England.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Who?—what lady?'—cried her friend,
'for heaven's sake keep me no longer in suspence.'</Q></P>
<P>Lady Hazard, seeing she had advanced so far, made no
scruple of relating the whole story, as In∣got told it to my lord, from
first to last. When she had finished, Lady Roebuck asked the name of
the lady, which her friend confessed she did not know, 
<PB N="201" REF="236"/> but said that it would be very easy to satisfy
them∣selves by sending to Mr. Ingot.</P>
<P>This was scarcely agreed on before Lady Roebuck received a
letter from her handmaid Emma, which the reader shall have in her own words. 
<LETTER>
<HEAD>TO LADY ROEBUCK.</HEAD>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU would not have heard from me so soon a∣gain, but for
a circumstance which wears so much the air of a romance, that, had it not
been well cer∣tified, I could not have believed it:—but 
<Q> 
<L>'Dark and mysterious are the ways of providence,</L> 
<L>'Puzzled with mazes, and perplexed with errors,'</L></Q>
As says my and Mr. VOLTAIRE's favourite Cato.—A lady called here who
cried over Miss Annette, and has left a crucifix and several popish
relics, which I cannot say pleased me, for I have hated the Roman catholics
ever since I read the account of the massacre of the Hugunots, upon the
feast of St. Bartholomew. As to the holy war, some of the kings of England
were concerned in that, and there∣fore <PB N="202" REF="237"/> I shall not be
so wanting in loyalty as to men∣tion it; else I could a tale
unfold:—But to return to the lady. There were two French gentlemen with
her, one of whom, in very bad broken En∣glish, told me that he believed she
had an impor∣tant commission to execute, but he did not know the purport of
it. I wish I had understood French, I would have made her all her
pilgrimage relate, as faithfully as Othello did his. After she was gone,
which was not till the gentleman had kissed both my cheeks, I questioned
Miss concerning their conversation, and she informed me that the lady was
that very same she used to call Mamma Le Clerc in the convent. The jewels
she has left are for Sir Sidney, and as she had not the pleasure of
seeing him, she did not think proper to leave a packet of papers, but
said she would endeavour to find him in town, and there deliver it to
him.</P>
<P>Lord, my dear lady, what can be the meaning of all this?
Miss Annette was so confused and terrified, and indeed she did not
understand her very well, for they spoke it seems a different sort of
French, our young lady having polished hers, and that of the stranger being
a good deal provincial: but, as I said, dear Miss's
confusion—though very learned writers have doubted whether this admits
of a genetive case, and therefore, as I am proud to <PB N="203" REF="238"/>
yield to great authorities, I ought to say the confu∣sion of
Miss—was so great, that she had not the courage to ask many
questions; so I entreated her to go back and speak to the French lady
again, who appeared greatly surprised to find that Sir Sidney was married,
and when Miss Annette, at my desire, asked if she was her mother, she
replied that your ladyship was now the only mother to whom she owed any
duty, that she hoped you would treat her kindly, and that Miss would repay
you with grati∣tude.</P>
<P>My sweet little charge is very well, and comes on
surprisingly. I entreated her not to write on this subject till I had
your advice. Her letter could not avoid falling into Sir Sidney's hands. This
will seem only to concern household affairs, and, as the poet says, 
<Q> 
<L>'Escape the scythe by being low.'</L></Q></P>
<P>I hate a falsity, but, without a little laudable de∣ceit,
how can we guard against the evils of life?—Minerva thought duplicity
so necessary in the con∣duct of her favourite Ulysses, that she
condescended to teach him that heroic quality herself.</P>
<P>I beg to know, my worthy lady, how I am to 
<PB N="204" REF="239"/> act in this affair, and be assured, in respect of
all the requisite feminine virtues, no Emma—from Prior's nut-brown maid
to Emma Corbet, can have a more extensive and proper sense than</P>
<CLOSER>
<SIGNED>Your very humble, And most grateful handmaid, EMMA
DISTICH.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER></P>
<P>This letter seemed to clear up the whole business, and it
being upon enquiry found that the name of the lady his lordship saw at Mr.
Ingot's house was Le Clerc, Lady Roebuck did not ballance a moment in her
mind, as to the probability of her being the mother of Annette.</P>
<P>In this exigence she consulted Lady Hazard on what conduct
she ought to pursue, who being, as we have seen, no friend to duplicity,
though even of that laudable kind recommended by Emma, ad∣vised her, without
delay, to inform Sir Sidney of the whole truth, telling her she had
wonderfully well succeeded with her lord by the same mode of experiment
within the last fortnight.</P>
<P>This brought forward the story of Miss Snaffle, which the
reader has seen so fully investigated, and <PB N="205" REF="240"/> which
not being told without the highest enco∣miums on Mr. Standfast's attachment
and integrity, and an information that his lordship had settled an
additional annuity on him, Lady Roebuck tes∣tified the greatest
surprise, which Lady Hazard perceiving, said, you may well shudder at
the world's villany. I wish I could prevail with my lord to embrace Sir
Sidney's offer, that I might live always with you in retirement.</P>
<P>Lady Roebuck, whose shudderings had been at hearing of
Standfast's great influence in the family, was upon the point of saying
something which might have led to an investigation of his conduct, not very
favourable to that gentleman; but finding Lady Hazard had given her
surprise another motive, she contented herself for the present with
falling in with that lady's conjectures, and simply remarking that indeed the
expectations of villains were so ina∣dequate to the pains they took, and the
risks they run, that she wondered men became knaves to be infamous, when,
by only being honest, they might be happy.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER VIII.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>THE HERO CLEARED A LITTLE FROM THE COBWEBS OF THE LIBRARY.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>I MAKE no scruple to confess that my leaving the
business of Miss Le Clerc and the possibility of Standfast's
detection in such a state of uncertainty as they appeared to be at the end
of the last chapter, is taking a liberty with the reader, and, what is
worse, with the ladies. But the consideration of having so long forborne
to introduce my hero, who, by the way, would be the last to excuse me for
be∣ing guilty of the smallest incivility to the fair sex, has got the
better of all others:—for indeed the circumstances in this history
are so various, and follow in such quick succession, that really if I
do not use some expedition to bring him forward, I might as well have no
hero at all. Just so far how∣ever I have nothing to reproach myself with;
for, though hitherto he has said very little, I can assure the reader he
has thought a great deal. To what purpose will hereafter appear. At present
I shall proceed to the examination of his good and bad qualities, a portion
of each—for I am afraid there is nothing perfect in this world—he
certainly had; <PB N="207" REF="242"/> and having cleared away the shores, and
made every other proper preparation—for we may well give him fair
play—fairly launch him on the ocean of life, where we shall see him
steming many adverse gales of fortune, in which it will be difficult to
de∣termine whether most to admire his distress or his fortitude.</P>
<P>I certainly had some apprehensions that having suffered a
fourth part of this work to pass without approaching to such a
necessary business, the reader might perhaps be given to imagine that I
called Charles Hazard the hero out of facetiousness, and merely by
inference and deduction, and so use him as a painter does a layman, which
stands in all the attitudes, bears the helmet, drapery, or poll parrot of the
hero or heroine, and yet, though he play this respectable part, is never
known personally to the spectators.</P>
<P>To say the truth, I have often been wickedly in∣clined to
wish that many heroes I have met with in my life had been so dealt with,
and it is not impos∣sible but some of my readers may retort the
cour∣tesy; for it so happens that particular people find in these said
heroes particular qualities, which ge∣nerally being adventitious, it is fifty
to one if a hero-maker thinks of them, and, in the absence of these 
<PB N="208" REF="243"/> qualities, though the gentleman should be
possessed of ever so long a catalogue of real and permanent virtues,
he sinks to a nonentity, in the opinion of such critics, because he does
not happen to be en∣livened with their favourite animating principle.</P>
<P>I cannot give a stronger instance of what I have advanced
than by producing the names of two of the greatest men in their way that ever
lived:—I mean ALEXANDER of Macedon the great warrior, and A∣LEXANDER of
Twickenham the great poet.</P>
<P>ALEXANDER the warrior would not have given three-pence for all
the noisy applause and bellowing acclamations of the largest populace
that ever as∣sembled, if they had not hailed him son of Jupiter; and
ALEXANDER the poet—according to Dr. JOHN∣SON—continually made
himself wretched lest the world should fancy him to be the son of
nobody; yet I appeal to any one if the fighting hero had been the offspring of
a beggar, and the writing hero the heir of a king, whether one would have cut
throats, or the other 
<Q REND="inline">'lisped numbers'</Q> in greater perfection.
Neither of these could conquer his favourite foible, which it is admirable to
remark proceeded in the warrior from hope, and in the poet from fear. This
imaginary honour in one, and blot in the other, nothing could efface; for
vainly did ALEXANDER's <PB N="209" REF="244"/> mother ridicule the
preposterous folly of her son, saying, 
<Q REND="inline">'hush, hush, my dear boy, you don't
con∣sider you are bringing me into a scrape, for if you talk so loud
about being the son of Jupiter, you will make Juno angry with
me:'</Q>—and equally unsuccessful were the efforts of POPE's friends,
who it is said told him it was ridiculous to lament that he was the son of
a tradesman, when the father of ESCHINES, the Socratic philosopher, was but
a sausage-maker.</P>
<P>A hundred instances may be adduced, perhaps a thousand, to
prove upon what cobweb qualities the very essence of a hero often depends;
but none I believe can be found stronger than those I have given. Let us
then settle the dispute in this way: Let all matters relative to Charles
Hazard, which are totally dependant upon chance, be considered as out of his
power to alter or amend, and all qua∣lities, good, bad, or indifferent, which
are the re∣sult of his serious reflections, be understood as his act and
deed, and censured or praised accordingly.</P>
<P>Charles had been left from his infancy in the quiet and
unwearied pursuit of every useful and ele∣gant accomplishment. All
these advantages had been procured for him at home, under a tutor who
cer∣tainly had some taste, and a father who had more; <PB N="210" REF="245"/> both of whom were perfectly well satisfied with his progress.
His ardour had been so unremitting, that perfection, by the help of
perseverence, seemed to be within his reach. I therefore left him to
him∣self, for why should I interrupt him in the midst of so laudable a
career?—especially when those very advantages are good
recommendations to the reader.</P>
<P>Having untied him, however, a little from his mother's apron
strings, I shall now fairly trust him to the bent of his
inclination:—and this for several good reasons:—one is, that my
veracity as a histo∣rian obliges me to it, for Standfast declared to
Vi∣ney, before he set out—first indeed giving him some other
instructions—he should try what mettle the youngster was made
of.</P>
<P>Charles was at this time something more than seventeen, so
that he took the field young, as did his namesake of Sweden. He was not,
however, at all like that great man in any respect, except in∣deed that no
Charles the Twelfth upon earth could be a more rigid observer of his word;
for, as the Swedish Charles could never be perswaded by any body, the
English Charles placed an implicit faith in every body, and as the fighting
hero hated the sight of a woman, the scientific hero was charmed with every
woman he saw.</P>
<P><PB N="211" REF="246"/> Charles—for there is no hiding
it—was very amorous, and very credulous. His credulity, how∣ever, was not
of that kind begot by adulation upon impudence; he was too modest to be vain;
but when a plausible appeal was made to the softness of his manners, the
strength of his sensibility, or the excellence of his heart, his expanded
soul cherished the fiction because it wore the garb of truth; there∣fore,
in him, credulity was a virtue: and yet virtue would be in much less repute
than it is—for which there is little necessity—if it met with
no better re∣ward. His propensity to the softer passions were, though
so young, of a pretty robust kind, for he had already attacked, and that
very briskly, fat Betty, who, by force of arms, or rather fists, defended
her virtue. Nor was he less solicitous with Lady Ha∣zard's woman, before
whom, about a week previous to his journey, his father found him on his knees,
which accident produced the following short lec∣ture.</P>
<P>My lord having pretty well shamed him, said— 
<Q REND="inline">'Charles, I am glad to see this grace in you;
I never before spoke to you with the harshness of a father; hitherto you
have had nothing from me but the mildness of that character. I am scarcely
sorry for what has happened, because it gives me an opportunity of
speaking on a subject which I <PB N="212" REF="247"/> could not otherwise
so well have introduced.—You have heard of my excesses in my youth;
they have cost me reflections bitterer than I would wish my worst enemy.
I am not hurt at seeing you susceptible, nor do I expect, as you grow up,
to keep you entirely continent. You are informed, your opinions are decided
ones, and you have an understanding far beyond your years, or I should not
be so explicit. You have conferred on me one great blessing, which I know
you will never deprive me of: I mean a faithful observance of your word upon
all occasions. If, upon consult∣ing your heart, you can truly make me the
pro∣mise I am going to ask of you, these are the last words you shall
ever hear from me on this subject. I would naturally recommend to you to
think of no idle amours; but perhaps that is impossible: if it should be
so, chuse some other place than your father's house: let me know
nothing of it. I should pity and perhaps forgive the frailties of my son,
but I should shudder at being his confi∣dant.</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'The promise I exact from you is to combat
your inclinations upon all occasions, but to subdue them absolutely and
entirely when they tempt you to the seduction of a wife or daughter, or any
way tend to disturb domestic happiness.'</Q></P>
<P><PB N="213" REF="248"/> 
<Q REND="inline">'My dear father,' cried Charles, 'throwing
him∣self on his knees, and taking Lord Hazard's hand, 'I promise you your
advice shall be engraven on my heart, and so may I prosper as I keep or
reject it.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Enough,' said Lord Hazard, 'abundantly
enough; I know you will keep your word, and therefore nothing can pass
between you and I upon this subject again.'</Q></P>
<P>Foibles our hero certainly had in plenty, but he had also many
excellent qualities. Indeed they will be well exercised in the course of
this work, for though no temper was ever more tried, or mind more worked upon,
yet I defy any one to detect him in the commission of either an ungenerous
or a disho∣nourable action.</P>
<P>This in common heroes is nothing, for being made up entirely of
sterling virtues, without alloy, what wonder if they come out of the fire of
tempta∣tion pure and undeminished?—but for an elegant, handsome, fine
young fellow, unsuspecting, inex∣perienced, sensible, accomplished,
born to capti∣vate and be captivated—for such a one neither to turn out
a puppy nor a knave, is an instance that does not every day attract our
admiration.</P>
<P><PB N="214" REF="249"/> But I have often held—and many will
agree with me—that is is as easy to do right as wrong, and in my hero
this truth is illustrated; for know reader, this young gentleman preserved
his honour, nay perhaps his life, by a strict adherence to one ruling
principle, which, being so young, it is singularly admirable he should
set down for himself. It was this: never to promise what was improper to
per∣form, but having made a promise never to break it.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER IX.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>ABOUT BUNDLING AND OTHER AMCROUS MATTERS.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>STANDFAST's journey into the country was to the house of a
young clergyman, to whom he was pa∣tron. Read it ye great, and confess your
insigni∣ficance. Your dependants have their hangers on; your very toad-eaters
have their tools: nay, some∣times, you are their tools yourselves. Has not
your steward his carriage, his country house, his hounds, his partridge
mews, and his doxey? and do not you pay for it? Nay he is, in point of
certainty, so much better off than you, that, were you to be ruined, and even
through his mismanagement, he could behold the wreck from the shore, and
get comfortably to a retreat which your bounty pro∣vided for him.</P>
<P>This young clergyman, whose name was Figgins, was originally a
Bridewell boy. Standfast took a great fancy to him one evening, as he
signalized himself on a rejoicing night. The peculiar address with which
he broke the windows of such as would not put out lights, and threw squibs
into coaches to frighten ladies, and burn their cloaths, evinced 
<PB N="216" REF="251"/> such a proneness to mischief, that Standfast
felt a congenial warmth, and immediately determined to select this youth as a
fit instrument, in time, for nobler daring.</P>
<P>It was necessary, however, that he should add to this
unluckiness and audacity a necessary portion of subtilty. He therefore
asked him several questions, to which he received such answers as
pleased him; that is to say, full of impudence and ambiguity: and hearing
him afterwards tell one of his compa∣nions that he had queered Raven Grey, his
mind was so made up that he determined—to use his own
phrase—upon patronizing him.</P>
<P>The reader however must not imagine that Mr. Standfast laid
himself open to his dependant; the matter was apparently brought about
through the medium of a third person, indeed Mr. Viney, to whom this hopeful
youth was a distant relation, and he was required, among other things, to
consider Mr. Standfast as an exemplary character.</P>
<P>The tutor prevailed upon a bishop, a friend of his—I
sincerely hope the bishop did not know what he was about—to ordain
this spark; and this was the very friend he left in the care of Little
Hockley.</P>
<P><PB N="217" REF="252"/> At the time Charles and his tutor paid
this visit to Mr. Figgins, he was in the possession of a vica∣rage
near Poole, which living Standfast procured him from a noble earl, in some
respects however owing to the young parson's own conduct, for he was so
civil to introduce to his lordship a near re∣lation, which circumstance
ended in my lord's making up, for a large sum of money, a suit which the
young lady commenced against him for seduc∣tion, though the earl was about
her thirteenth lover. One of this number, by her advice, quitted the kingdom
lest he should be taken up for the forgery of a bank note, which, after he
was gone, she changed, and put the money in her pocket.</P>
<P>Standfast's business with Mr. Figgins was of a very
particular nature, and perhaps the reader may sometime hence join with me in
that opinion.—Whatever it was, Standfast did not chuse to transact
it by letter, it being one of his maxims never to write any thing but what all
the world might read, nor make either promises or declarations in the
pre∣sence of a third person.</P>
<P>In conformity to this latter part of his maxim, he very
frequently took his friend Figgins with him either a walk or a ride, begging
Charles to take care of the ladies till their return. These ladies 
<PB N="218" REF="253"/> were, first Mr. Figgins's maiden aunt, a woman of
exemplary character, an enthusiastic admirer of Drelincourt and a dram
glass, and who her nephew very humanely maintained, upon her paying him down
quarterly the sum of eight pounds. Secondly Mrs. Figgins the ninth—for,
like Major O'Flaherty, he had them in all quarters, and all alive and
merry;—and, lastly, Miss Figgins, a young lady of beauty and
accomplishments, but who had not yet got a husband—though she owned
twenty-seven—because the men were brutes, and her nature was so
delicate that the least ill treatment would break her heart.</P>
<P>Charles found it no disagreeable task to entertain these
ladies, in the absence of his tutor; nay he made a traffic of his
complaisance, for he wrote an impromtu for a smile, and sketched their
portrait for a kiss. His skill in music enchanted them, and they wished
never to part with the young lord, as he was called.</P>
<P>As to Miss Figgins, had any one witnessed her behaviour at
those unguarded moments when he sung a pathetic air—though, by the
bye, he was of that age when the voice sounds more like that of a raven than
a nightingale—he would have sworn she had at once conquered her
aversion to love and ma∣trimony. <PB N="219" REF="254"/> To say truth, her
virtue was of the ram∣pant kind, which perhaps was one reason she
con∣tinually talked of the great pains she took to subdue it. Indeed she
so prompted Charles in that part, which, if it had been the time to act, he
knew with∣out a cue, that the young gentleman had a kind of rebellion to quell,
which gave him no little distur∣bance. In short, in spight of his teeth
he was obliged to take a review of the promise he had made his father, and
reflecting that the sister of Mr. Fig∣gins must certainly be a woman of
honour, he tri∣umphantly carried the point, and congratulated himself on this
victory over his passions. Indeed the term sister was not included in
the conditions, but it was certainly implied, and it would have been
dishonourable had he taken advantage of the omission.</P>
<P>The lady however having made good her land∣ing, determined to
lose no opportunity of improv∣ing that advantage; therefore, one day, while
they sat at dinner, she slily slipt a note into the young gentleman's
coat pocket, which contained these words both in form and substance.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'For hevven sake mete mee in the arburr, and
lett mee, ho lett mee, unbuzzum myself.'</Q></P>
<P><PB N="220" REF="255"/> Charles was too gallant not to attend the
lady.—Indeed it was very much his wish to have a little conversation
with her alone; not doubting but when the purity of his intentions were
honestly made known, the young lady's quiet would be restored, which at
present he made no doubt he greatly dis∣turbed. Having therefore attended
the appoint∣ment, he declared to her with the truest and most honest
simplicity, his repugnance to do that which he could not consider
otherwise than as a shameful breach of hospitality. The lady acknowledged
the generosity of his sentiments, and said, that as she saw her fears
were unnecessary, they might now in∣dulge in all those little innocent
freedoms which to susceptible and delicate hearts gave such
delight.—In short, after much simpering, stammering, blush∣ing,
and other indications of maiden bashfulness—the largest part of
which, especially the blushing, was most manifest in
Charles—she informed him that, upon certain conditions, he should
steal to her bedchamber, and sleep with her that very night. These
conditions were explained to be exactly what I am informed they practise very
commonly, and very innocently in America, under the name of bundling.</P>
<P>Perhaps Miss Figgins had heard of Adhelm, who, to try his
virtue, slept several nights with a <PB N="221" REF="256"/> virgin without
violating his chastity, and under∣standing Charles was intended for a great
man, de∣termined it should not be her fault if he had not this proof of his
virtue in as great perfection as his pious predecessor. If however these
were her intentions, there was some how or other an infraction in the treaty,
for Charles and the lady so bundled that, at the end of a fortnight, she
informed him, in the most decent manner so delicate a creature could
muster up words for the purpose, that she was certainly with child.</P>
<P>What a stroke for our hero! Must he begin al∣ready to feel
the bitter reflections of having broken his promise. How to act? Which way to
conceal her shame? He could not marry her—which at some intervals he
had thoughts of—without consult∣ing his father, and the consequence
of such a con∣sultation was apparent. Yet he had ruined her, and brought
her into a situation that marriage alone could atone for. In so doing he
had already broken his promise, and why not go farther, since there was no
honourable means of retreat.</P>
<P>In this state, chequered with pleasure and com∣punction, had
he passed several days, when Mr. Standfast one morning told our hero
that some damned thing or other had come to his fatheris ears, 
<PB N="222" REF="257"/> who required their immediate presence in town.— 
<Q REND="inline">'See there,'</Q> said he, shewing him a
letter he had that instant received. 
<LETTER>
<HEAD>TO THE REV. Mr. STANDFAST.</HEAD>
<P> If you have the smallest regard for my peace of mind,
come post to me the moment you receive this.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>HAZARD.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER></P>
<P>Charles not doubting but his amour and its con∣sequences had
already reached his father's ears, without considering how the intelligence
could have been conveyed, told his tutor ingenuously that he was the cause
of it. Mr. Standfast seemed greatly astonished at the declaration, and
demanded how it could possibly be? The pupil exacting a solemn promise
from his tutor that he would carefully pre∣serve the most profound
secresy, let him into the bundling secret from first to last, and
concluded with vehemently entreating his advice.</P>
<P>Standfast looking very sagacious, said this must be the
cause of Lord Hazard's injunction sure enough, which it was a very proper
thing to com∣ply with, for fear of irritating him farther. As for the rest,
he said it was a cursed unlucky affair, but <PB N="223" REF="258"/>
fortunately the brother was under his thumb, and his best endeavours might be
depended on to hush matters up.</P>
<P>If his father should mention it, he advised Charles to deny
the whole business; though he had no doubt but he should use such
arguments as would induce him not to say a word about it.</P>
<P>Charles was in raptures at the kindness of his tu∣tor, who
took care nevertheless to give the young gentleman a wholesome lecture,
declaring his great repugnance to this duplicity of conduct, and pro∣testing
he only consented to it from the laudable view of preventing a difference
between father and son.</P>
<P>By this time the chaise was at the door; for Standfast,
zealous to obey his patron's mandate, had ordered it previous to this
conversation with his pupil. The latter therefore took a hasty, but ten∣der
leave of his enamorata, who exacted a promise that he would write to her,
and, if possible, see her soon again.</P>
<P>On the road, Standfast encouraged Charles to keep up his
spirits. He told him, for one thing, that his honour was in no scrape; for
that the lady, how∣ever <PB N="224" REF="259"/> she might have imposed upon
his inexperience, was not a vestal, nor had been for a good twenty years.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Why she is but six and twenty,' said
Charles:</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'and eleven added to it,' replied the tutor. 'As
to the brat, if there should be one, we must see what's to be done with
it. I have told you all these matters,' added he, 'lest you should be
im∣properly drawn in, therefore you must promise me to be upon your guard.
No indiscreet marri∣ages, nor any other steps without first consulting
me. Upon these and no other terms will I un∣dertake this
business.'</Q></P>
<P>Charles eagerly promised every thing his tutor demanded of
him, and Standfast reiterated his friend∣ly professions. They both
arrived in town however with no little anxiety on their minds. That of Charles
proceeded, as the reader knows, from his fear of having made his father
miserable. Mr. Stand∣fast had too hearty a contempt for every human
weak∣ness to feel the influence of any such hen-hearted sensation.
Glorious mischief begat his perplexity, and all his uneasiness was lest
the banquet preparing for his inexorable senses should not be
seasoned high enough with domestic wretchedness.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER X.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>CONSISTING OF COMFORT AND CONSOLATION, ADMINISTERED BY THE
FRIENDLY MR. STANDFAST.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>IT was agreed, upon the arrival of Charles and his tutor, that
the latter should go first to see how the land lay, and that the young
gentleman should not see his father—thereby to give their project
breath—till he had paid his respects to Lady Ha∣zard.</P>
<P>Mr. Standfast immediately sought my lord, and having very
opportunely found him, he was in∣formed, with but little previous ceremony,
that his patron was undone—lost—irretrievable lost, beyond all
possibility of hope.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Good God!' exclaimed Standfast, with terror
in his countenance, 'whence can this unexpected blow have come? It is no
diminution of your fortune my lord?'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Of my life, of my soul, of my honour!'
re∣turned my lord. 'Oh that I had listened to thy advice. Heavenly God! that
a man should mur∣der his peace, sell his life's happiness, and render 
<PB N="226" REF="261"/> himself despicable for the brutal, villanous
grati∣fication of a single moment! Will you know the extent of my misery?
the giddy precipice on which I stood, and frightful abyss into which I am
plunged? Will you know my torment, my horror, my despair, my hell?'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Be calm, my lord,' said Standfast,</Q> with
the utmost commiseration he could convey into his countenance. 
<Q REND="inline">'Calm!' replied his lordship, 'yes, when I
have destroyed myself, when the wretches have added my death to the
destruction of my peace of mind.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Wretches! What wretches?' cried Standfast
eagerly.</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Keep me not on this wrack of suspence,
lest my friendship take the alarm, and I yield to my fears of that fatal
evil which my boding heart has so long anticipated.</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Hear the truth then,' said my lord, 'and let
all worthy men, like thee, detest me while I utter it. I have lain with that
infernal woman, she has communicated to me a damned disease, and I have
infected my dear, my innocent wife, that excel∣lent creature, that pattern of
her sex beyond all example, who never had a blemish on her heart or
understanding but when she joined her unhappy fate to a worthless wretch
like me.'</Q></P>
<P><PB N="227" REF="262"/> 
<Q REND="inline">'Angels of pity comfort me!' said
Standfast.—'Ah my dear lord, why did I go this curst journey into the
country? If I had been on the spot, I am sure I should have saved
you.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'It would have been useless,' cried my lord,
starting from a chair, into which he had thrown himself. 'I had ceased to
confide in you before you left town, and was glad of a pretext to get rid of
your solicitation.'</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Standfast now uttered a most warm and pa∣thetic
speech, lamenting general depravity, and de∣ploring most affectingly his
friend's want of resolu∣tion. So excellent indeed were his reasons, his
re∣marks so heartfelt, and his manner so persuasive, that my lord
declared there lived not his equal.—To say truth, this speech had its
merit, and so it ought, for like many other speeches which are in∣tended to
surprise instead of convince, it had been some time in preparation. And
now the tutor en∣treated to know the particulars of this unfortunate
business, desirous perhaps of being satisfied whether his actors had
performed their parts in the manner he had set down for them, especially as
he had such an opportunity of hearing their respective merits from a critic
who would be sure to do them justice.</P>
<P><PB N="228" REF="263"/> My lord briefly told him that being
informed by Colonel Tiltly and some others that a gentleman named Snaffle was
traducing him in every coffee-house where he came, and that one of his
friends who vindicated him had very nearly got into a duel on his account, he
made it his business to seek after Snaffle, but found only the sham
sister as before who it was plain was instructed to play upon him'. At
length he found his man at home, when matters were very handsomely explained,
and he was idiot enough to stay to supper. The presence of the
sister, and the bumpers with which he was drenched pro∣duced the rest. 
<Q REND="inline">'But,' concluded my lord, 'that a set of
people should conspire the ruin of a man so little known to them, and
work the destruction of his peace of mind, is a species of wickedness and
depravity that I cannot give either motive or name.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'My dear lord,' cried Standfast impatiently, I
see a gleam of happiness here, a celestial and be∣nignant ray of
hope.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'What do you mean?' ex∣claimed Lord Hazard.</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'These people,' cried Standfast, 'have
reaped no pecuniary advantage from their villany.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'How should they?' said his lordship.</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'No, none;—it is a contrivance then,'
cried Standfast, 'of Mrs. O'Shocknesy; God send she may be
disappointed.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Heaven <PB N="229" REF="264"/> and earth,' cried
my lord, 'you have certainly divined the truth; it is that diabolical wretch
sure enough: who else could have taken such unheard of pains to make me
miserable? I knew, I felt, thou wouldst comfort me. But still is not the
ca∣lamity the same, my dear Standfast?'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Not at all my lord,' answered his kind friend
very con∣fidently. 'Are you sure of what you say in relation to your
lady?'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'From what I may reasonably conjecture it
must be so,' said my lord. 'Oh God! if I could but flatter myself
there.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">Well, well, hope for the best,' cried
Standfast. 'You forget my lord how artfully the snare was laid for you. I
am sure if your lordship was off your guard, there is no prudence but may
be surprised. My advice is this: If, for the sake of your lady's health,
matters should require an explanation, honestly give it her, and lay the
blame upon Mrs. O'Shocknesy; I would stake my life upon the is∣sue. And
now my lord throw off your chagrin; I dare say your lady knows no
uneasiness upon this subject but that which she has felt from seeing
you miserable.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'She shall see me so no longer then,'
said my lord. 'By imitating thee I will grow honest, and that shall teach
me to be chearful.'</Q></P>
<P><PB N="230" REF="265"/> Having so far adjusted matters, Lord
Hazard felt himself wonderfully relieved. As for Charles, all he could learn
from his mother was, that her lord had, for several days, appeared very ill
and very uneasy; that it certainly was caused by some disagreeable news
he had heard; 
<Q REND="inline">'but,' continued she, 'whatever it is, we
must unite to comfort him. I am sure from me he deserves every thing, for
his affection encreases every day.'</Q></P>
<P>Charles, convinced he was the cause of his fa∣ther's
unhappiness, took leave of his mother as early as he decently could, to go in
quest of Stand∣fast, that common friend in the family: for surely it is
the office of a friend to make people easy.</P>
<P>The tutor was ready to receive him, and appa∣rently anxious to
put him out of pain, for he seized him very cordially by the hand, and told
him mat∣ters were in such a swimming train, that he had only to appear as
if nothing had happened, and he might be assured that his father would not
even mention the circumstance.</P>
<P>Standfast had now restored the tranquility of both father
and son, and in some measure his own; for the latter part of his
conversation with his patron was concerning Lady Roebuck, but as he could not
<PB N="231" REF="266"/> gather any reason to believe she had been tatling,
he fairly concluded she was afraid to attack him, or else perhaps, as
chance had thrown him again in her way, the lady had wisely adopted the
proverb better late than never; and so promised herself the
accom∣plishment of what his vanity induced him to believe she wished:
so difficult is it for men of Mr. Stand∣fast's turn of mind to credit that
any one can be actuated by motives purely generous, and merely
disinterested.</P>
<P>The triumphant Mr. Standfast however had never been so near
detection as while he was absent. That conversation between the two ladies
which took a different turn, as the reader has seen, at the end of the
seventh chapter, had introduced into the mind of Lady Roebuck a number of
alarming fears for her friend. She could not give Mr. Standfast that implicit
credit which he seemed to exact of Lord and Lady Hazard, for the active part
he had taken in the business of Miss Snaffle. Indeed, knowing from her
own experience how little pretensions he had either to gratitude, principle,
or generosity, her tongue was very reluctantly reined in whenever she heard
any thing in his commendation; but at length, considering Lady Hazard was a
new, though a very intimate acquaintance, and that the office she longed to
undertake was rather a thankless one, she took a <PB N="232" REF="267"/>
little time for reflection, during which interval a circumstance happened
which decided her wavering resolution. As however it was of sufficient
conse∣quence to require that Sir Sidney should be consult∣ed, the reader
is of course anxious to know what it was, and the result of their
deliberations. The latter I am very ready to say was, that to arm Lord and
Lady Hazard against the machinations of Mr. Standfast was treading on very
tender ground, and therefore they ought not to take any material steps in
so weighty a business till their arrival in the coun∣try, where Sir
Sidney said he would begin this Her∣culean labour. This then they resolved.
As to the circumstance which procured this resolution, it will come better
hereafter. To have mentioned it here would have been premature, and not to have
said something on the suspicions of Sir Sidney and his lady, would have
been tacitly to have accused the reader of a deficiency in penetration, for
it is hardly possible that any one who knew Mr. Standfast should
believe him capable of devoting himself so suddenly to the practise of
real virtue, when his whole life had been an artful study how to keep up the
ap∣pearance of it.</P>
<P>Standfast has been seen very solicitous to get at the
particulars of Lord Hazard's unfortunate in∣trigue, for which I have
assigned the real motive; <PB N="233" REF="268"/> and, to say truth, he
was not pleased with the rela∣tion: for in his absence—to carry on
the allusion I used at that time—his peice had been mutilated by the
managers, and ill performed by the actors; a ma∣terial incident had been cut
out of his projecting, and another, by no means condusive to the
catastro∣phe he wished to take place, introduced.—These
al∣terations were principally owing to the heroine, who in real life, as well
as upon the stage, is generally apt to take these sort of liberties; and
though Mr. Standfast had not been present at the representation of his
performance, yet, being a consummate judge of effect, he saw plainly it
would have had more striking success could he have been on the spot to
have conducted it.</P>
<P>To drop this allusion, Standfast plainly saw that Mrs.
O'Shocknesy had taken the liberty to alter his plan, no doubt for private
ends of her own. He had left orders for an anonymous letter to be sent to
Lady Hazard on the very evening his lordship should be engaged at
Snaffle's, apprizing her of the fact. This, it was plain to Standfast, had
been neglected; but that something, as we before ob∣served, should be
substituted in its place, the lady had, through the means of Miss
Snaffle, conferred a favour on his lordship which she thought would serve
just as well to communicate the secret to Lady <PB N="234" REF="269"/>
Hazard. To say truth, this was a <HI>coup de grace</HI> which Standfast,
with all his rascallity, had not me∣ditated. It was a vengeance truly
feminine, and greatly worthy the vindictive Mrs. O'Shocknesy.—How
these conspirators answered their conduct to their ringleader will by and
by be seen. At pre∣sent I shall only say that Mrs. O'Shocknesy
defended herself by an argument which will at least prove her to be a
proper coadjutor of the great Mr. Stand∣fast. It was no less than that the
knowledge of Lady Hazard's pregnancy induced her to take that harmless step
before mentioned, without her prin∣cipal's privity; at which he was as much
incenced as was Hecate against the witches, who dared to prompt Macbeth in
his iniquity without her orders.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>PERMANENT HAPPINESS APPEARS TO BE RESTORED, AND THE WHOLE
SOCIETY SET OUT ON THEIR JOURNEY TO THE COUNTRY.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>IT will now be proper to speak concerning Miss Le Clerc,
whose whole history, as far as Mr. Ingot knew it, Sir Sidney learnt much
about the time the two ladies were reading Emma's letter; for the good citizen
being, as I observed, Lord Hazard's man of business, they were in a
manner obliged to consult him upon several points relative to the pro∣perty
of Little Hockley. On the first of these visits every thing naturally
came out, and when the ba∣ronet and his lady met, both were ripe for the
dis∣covery of what was no secret to either.</P>
<P>The story of Annette was no mystery, but it has been shewn
in what way it was told; and if Miss Le Clerc was Sir Sidney's wife, what
then was Lady Roebuck? This was a consideration of a most se∣rious
nature, and, in justice to so amiable a lady, it was admitted that it ought
to be set to rights.—Lord and Lady Hazard being therefore the only
persons who had it in their power to make a single <PB N="236" REF="271"/>
comment on this subject, and that nobleman and his lady having by this time,
for many reasons, be∣come great favourites with these two friends, they
were, without the alteration of a single circum∣stance, informed of the
real truth. This led to the establishment of a most intimate and binding
friend∣ship between the two couples, and the baronet and Lady Roebuck
felicitated themselves upon the cer∣tainty, as they now conceived it, of that
plan which they had formed of making Lord Hazard the re∣former of his own
village. As preaching however cannot have half the effect of example, they
resolved, as the reader has seen, to reserve their grand attack till they
should arrive at the place of action, when his lordship should be
assailed in such a manner as would deprive him of the means of defending
him∣self, and oblige him—especially as his lady was al∣ready gained
over—to surrender at discretion.</P>
<P>Lord Hazard very soon got perfectly restored to health, and
as there were no reasons to believe that his suspicions concerning his
lady had any founda∣tion, he by degrees regained his usual ease and
tran∣quility.</P>
<P>As to Charles, he received a quire of letters from Miss
Figgins, full of <HI>sythes and wows, and flamming arts;</HI> but, convinced
that under the guidance of <PB N="237" REF="272"/> Standfast, all he incurred
was a trifling expence, he rather felt proud of the business, and was not a
little pleased that, at an age under eighteen, he had given such notable
proofs of his manhood. He felt however very gratefully towards both his
parents, who he was convinced knew of his irregularity, and had the kindness
not to upbraid him with it; and, as this imaginary conduct of theirs induced
him to treat them with the most dutiful and minute atten∣tion, so it
endeared him to their notice and regard ten times stronger than ever. Sir
Sidney was not an idle spectator of this. He was charmed with Charles, and
really began to meditate seriously that alliance which it may be
recollected he mentioned formerly in jest.</P>
<P>These projects, which were intended to blossom in the
spring, and produce fruit in the summer, laid at present dormant in their
minds; we will there∣fore pass over the hurry of the winter, and bring them
to the sign of the John of Gaunt's Head, an inn in their way to
Warwickshire.</P>
<P>The landlord of this house, who was a great fa∣vourite of Sir
Sidney, prided himself on having as distinct and ample a genealogy as any
lord; nay he looked upon himself as superior to many who boast that
title: for, said he, 
<Q REND="inline">'What are lords, the crea∣tures 
<PB N="238" REF="273"/> of yesterday, to those in my family of three hundred
years standing?' adding, 'alack a day! human creatures are buckets in a well,
one up, and tother down.'</Q></P>
<P>This landlord was not a little proud of having been a
substantial yeoman of Kent. He had been indeed a considerable farmer, but
having a strong inclination to indulge himself in that hospitality in
which it was not within his circumstances to cut any tolerable figure, he had
entertained so many poor gentlemen of high extraction, till at length, as the
phrase is, he ran out; and, leaving off farming, left also his own country,
and took an inn not far from High Wickham.</P>
<P>The house bore all the insignia of its master's fan∣cied
consequence, and the reliques of those mighty deeds which were performed by
his ancestors, and in which he took so much pleasure, as he sat in his
chimney corner, to record, were distributed about wherever he could find a
place for them. Shields and spears glittered in the kitchen instead of
pot∣lids and spits; helmets and cuisses, in the place of stag's horns,
adorned the hall, and mismatched pieces of tapestry covered the walls of
every room.</P>
<P>Lord Hazard insisted upon being introduced in 
<PB N="239" REF="274"/> form, and Sir Sidney undertook to be gentleman usher
upon the occasion. My lord confessed he could boast but of very recent
extraction, being, as one might say, a junior branch of the nobility. 
<Q REND="inline">'Why truly' answered the landlord, 'you will
pardon my jocularity my lord, there is a spot of <HI>Rust</HI> on your
eschuteon which perhaps, by <HI>Hazard,</HI> may be rubbed out.'</Q></P>
<P>The archness as well as frankness of this reply pleased
his lordship so much, that he entered into a long conversation with the
landlord, that ended in an explanation of all the warlike trophies before
mentioned, the history of which contained a kind of summary review of the
history of England; we shall therefore forbear to recite any part of what
passed, except one remark. They were examining a ro∣sary, which was
said to have belonged to the un∣fortunate Mary, Queen of Scots. My lord
said that her's was a lamentable fate. 
<Q REND="inline">'Lamentable,' said the landlord, shaking his
head, 'if she had not been an angel upon earth, Bess would not have been
so ready to send her to make one in heaven.'</Q></P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XII.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>A NIGHT SCENE, WHICH MR. FLUSH WOULD HAVE CALLED A VERY
VARIETOUS KIND OF A THING.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>AT the inn where our travellers lay had arrived two musicians,
just before dark, who were going to a nobleman's scat in the neighbourhood,
upon a summer excursion, and where there was to be a grand concert the next
day. One of the gentlemen, an Italian, had the day before been seized with a
vio∣lent fever, but being told that his patron had sent express for him, he
determined to go in spight of his indisposition, especially as he knew
he should be taken greater care of at the house of his benefac∣tor than at
home. His companion came to ac∣quaint him that he had received a similar
summons. This put the finishing stroke to the Italian's deter∣mination;
for they were both famous performers on the trumpet, and seldom played
asunder.</P>
<P>At this meeting the two musicians talked about what fishing
and shooting they should have, and, above all, what delicious burgundy they
should taste at his lordship's; nor did they fail to enjoy, by
an∣ticipation, certain jokes which the Italian, being <PB N="241" REF="276"/> a
wag, had it in contemplation to play some of his lordship's retinue. One in
particular he concerted, which was to ridicule a black servant, for whom the
Italian had an inveterate aversion, because he could not blow the french
horn in tune. 
<Q REND="inline">'Perdio' cried he 'I tink I see de villain
cavaliero vid his vite orse and plack visage make one tammed nise oh
Diavo∣lo.'</Q> For it should here be known that his lord∣ship, though he
had constantly a troop of musicians after him, and some of them men of
distinguished talents, would rather have been called in at the death of a
fox, by the dissonant belching of his fa∣vourite horn, than have listened
to the best chorus of HANDEL, performed by five hundred and fifty-three
persons, capable of realizing all that celestial rapture of which Doctor
BURNEY dreamt.</P>
<P>The English musician took his leave of the Italian
recommending him to take as much rest as possible before they should
set off. In conformity with this advice, the Italian betook himself to
sleep, and passed the night in tolerable tranquility, except that he had
a slight delirium, in which he fancied the above mentioned black pursued
him, on his white horse, and that he escaped from him with great
difficulty; and much more such stuff, evi∣dently the effect of a
distempered brain. Having, however, shook off the phantom, he afterwards
ob∣tained <PB N="242" REF="277"/> tolerable repose, and felt himself pretty
well recovered when his friend, the English musician, came to call him
up.</P>
<P>I thought it necessary to premise thus much, that the
reader might the better account for a distur∣bance that happened at the inn.
The house was buried in a total silence, when the Italian, whose
distemper had received no mitigation from either the journey or a shower of
rain which had fallen in the afternoon, all of a sudden awoke from a horrid
dream, in which his inveterate enemy, the black, appeared to him on his
steed, as before, but with the addition of a large sabre, with which he
threa∣tened to put him instantly to death.</P>
<P>Frightened at the spectre, like Chamont, he rose and called
for lights, which indeed he need not have done, for there was a solitary
candle glimmering in the chimney corner, by the help of which imperfect
luminary, every thing could faintly be discerned. Leaping from the bed, the
first object his eyes en∣countered being a figure in the tapestry of Edward
the black prince, mounted upon a white horse, and giving directions at the
battle of Poictiers, he ran in a most frantic manner along the gallery, and,
ow∣ing to his corpulent form—which extremely re∣sembled a brandy keg,
or a ninepin, made a rapid <PB N="243" REF="278"/> descent to the hall
underneath. There, being in to∣tal darkness, he groped about for a
considerable time, to no purpose, in hopes of finding a door into the
yard.</P>
<P>All this time the fever being at an alarming height, every thing
he touched seemed to be the falling stroke of that monstrous instrument
of death wielded by the figure in the tapestry. At length, bellowing like a
bull, and bounding from one table to another, like a tost pancake, or a
kicked football, he discovered, as he imagined, the door. A faint glimmering
of light that beamed on him facilitated this welcome idea, and he strove, but
in vain, to find the lock. Exploring this impervious gloom, which, as far as
his scattered recollection gave op∣portunity to notice, appeared the seat
of sorcery, where all the demons of hell were assembled to tor∣ment him;
for as to being in an inn, it never once occurred to his imagination,
something that felt like down, and smelt intolerably bitter, fell about his
ears, and tormented him the more in proportion as he attempted to defend
himself from it. And now, having his eyes, nose and mouth pretty well
filled with this suffocating annoyance, which, con∣trary to the air-drawn
dagger of Macbeth, was sen∣sible only to the feeling, he stampt, rubbed
his face, raved, sputtered, and struggled, till at last he 
<PB N="244" REF="279"/> got out of the vortex of this den of Erebus, to which he
seemed to have been drawn by a hellish and invi∣sible influence.</P>
<P>Lifting however his hands in an extreme of
dis∣traction—indeed exactly as St. Paul is drawn preach∣ing at
Athens—something tumbled from above which fitted himself completely,
like a coat of ar∣mour, without the casque or cuisses.</P>
<P>Fully persuaded the demon that pursued him had now got him
in his clutches, he stormed, howled, foamed, and squeaked out as
incongruous and inar∣ticulate a recitative as ever Hannibal or Scipio did at
the opera house.</P>
<P>At this moment one of the waiters, who had been to pay a visit
to the bed chamber of the cook maid Molly, and who of course was the most
watchful in the house, entered the hall with a lighted candle.</P>
<P>The Italian's singular jeopardy was occasioned by his
mistaking the chimney for the door. There, struggling to get out, he had
made himself as black as a soot bag, and, upon his retreat, fairly
invested himself in the strange manner above mention, with a buff jerkin,
which my landlord had received as a legacy from his father, who affirmed and
verily <PB N="245" REF="280"/> believed that it was the same worne by Guy,
Earl of Warwick, when he killed the dun cow.</P>
<P>No sooner had the waiter seen this precious relique of his
master's ancestors in the hands, or rather on the back of the Italian,
than, taking him for a thief, who wanted to rob the house, he ran to fetch
his master. The Italian, to be even with him, upon descrying the light and
an opposite door at the same time, ran rapidly up another pair of stairs.
His precipitate flight confirmed the waiter in his sus∣picions, and
facilitated his return to his master, who, by this time, alarmed by the
noise, had just issued from his apartment.</P>
<P>The landlord having heard the matter from his man, swore by
the glory of his forefathers he would cut him up alive, and invoking the manes
of Ed∣ward the black prince, and John of Gaunt, followed muttering curses all
the way to the chamber of the English musician, whither the Italian had by
acci∣dent directed his flight, and to where his distracted bellowing piloted
both man and master.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the Italian had reached his brother
professor's apartment, and hid himself, buff jerkin and all, under the
cloaths. The English∣man, disturbed by the noise, and still more by the
<PB N="246" REF="281"/> Italian's flouncing into bed, waked in an instant, and
before he had time to recollect what could oc∣casion so extraordinary an
intrusion, saw in a con∣fused manner, by the help of the light which
dimly gleamed through the passage, what a strange hedi∣ous figure he had
in bed with him, on which he had no sooner cast his eyes, than, in a
dreadful fright, he all of a sudden leaped from the bed, and got under
it.</P>
<P>The Italian, who began to perceive the light, and concluding his
companion had seen the man and horse which he had no doubt still
pursued him, followed him close at his heels, being under the bed almost
as soon as him. The English musician being pressed hard by the same
abominable figure, half dead with the fright, crawled out on the opposite
side, which happened to be next to the door, still followed by the
Italian.</P>
<P>The landlord and the waiter now came up with them, and the
candle being produced, the appear∣ance of this quadrumvirate was beyond the
power of tongue or pen to describe. The distraction of the Italian, the
astonishment of his companion, the pa∣ralytic fear of the landlord, who,
spight of the ex∣amples of his ancestors, trembled from head to foot, and
the consternation of the waiter, composed in <PB N="247" REF="282"/> their
different countenances such a set of unbrage∣ous, olive, livid and
cadaverous tints as surely no faces ever before exhibited.</P>
<P>The English trumpeter, as he encountered the landlord, was
overturned, and now lay flat on the floor. The descendant of Hengist had
gathered himself up into a grotesque attitude, looking at the fallen
musician, and the waiter was pushing the candle forward, under his
master's arm, to see what was the matter, while the Italian had crept to
the other side of the bed, and having searched for something to defend
himself, catched up his com∣panion's trumpet, who had brought that
instrument into his chamber, to have it safe. With this wea∣pon he leapt
upon a chest of drawers, and whether he was now wrought to such a height of
phrenzy as not to know what he did, or whether instinct con∣ducted the
trumpet to his mouth without his know∣ledge, certain it is that his stretched
companion had scarcely demanded what was the matter, and the landlord
thundered out a volley of execrations, ending with 
<Q REND="inline">'give me my jerkin,'</Q> than the Italian
sounded a charge, and then a defiance, and then a parley, as fast as they
could succeed each other.</P>
<P>The moment the English musician heard the trumpet, he knew
his friend as well as if he had <PB N="248" REF="283"/> spoken to him, and
instantly guessed that the con∣fusion must have been occasioned by
the Italian's ill∣ness, who had become delirious, and thus alarmed the
house.</P>
<P>Feeling, however, for the safety of his trumpet, which same
provident sensation impelled the land∣lord in relation to the Earl of
Warwick's habili∣ment, they both approached him, where he stood, trumpet in
hand, like another fame in a buff jerkin, and were within an inch of their
prey, when the Italian fairly made a spring over their heads, darted out of
the door, and ran along the gallery, then down stairs, afterwards out of the
back door into the yard, and lastly all over the village, blowing away
almost without any cessation.</P>
<P>This was a partial last trump to the village, for all but
those in their graves immediately started up to see what was the matter.
As to the inn, imagi∣nation never formed so singular a confusion. The
musician raved for his trumpet, the landlord stormed for his buff jerkin;
here a waiter appeared with his cloaths tumbled into the tail of his shirt,
which he held by way of an apron; there a maid servant with a petticoat tied
about her head instead of her waist; here John the ostler appeared in
Sukey's night cap, and Sukey in John's wig:—In short there was not 
<PB N="249" REF="284"/> one person in the house—for all agreed to put
o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> manly firmness, and meet in
the hall together—even to Sir Sidney and Lord Hazard, that did not cut a
ludicrous figure, while the village cried out some a fight, others a fire,
and all with hasty steps ran towards our inn, which thus, in a few minutes,
was filled, in addition to its own company, with the major part of the village,
among whom were not a few females with clouts about their heads, and children
in their arms, a sort of spectators who are sure to be foremost at
every sight, be it a boxing match, a lord mayor's shew, or an
execution.</P>
<P>The English musician, getting upon the great table, now
begged to be heard; and having at last obtained silence, very naturally
accounted for every thing that had happened, finishing with a declara∣tion
that he apprehended the Italian must now be so far gone, that the
landlord's jerkin and his trum∣pet were certainly in danger of being
spoiled.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Far gone!' cried a country fellow, 'why I zeed
un myzel at the back of Master Clover's barn, and that's only behind thick
here orchard. Oons, do but list a tiny bit; dost not hear un?'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'I do,' exclaimed the musician, 'I do, and my
dear trum∣pet is as sound as ever! Zounds, I know what I will do: shew me
to his bed chamber:'</Q>—at <PB N="250" REF="285" MS="y"/> which he jumped
down, and so scampered up stairs, that the spectators began to fear
lest he should be infected with the same phrenzy as his companion. A very
few seconds however brought him back again, with the Italian's own trumpet,
hollowing out, 
<Q REND="inline">'This will do, this will do; here is that
shall bring him back again.'</Q> He now hastened to the yard door, and,
putting the trumpet to his mouth, sounded a defiance, which was immediately
answered at a distance. In his next essay he was answered somewhat
nearer. Upon two or three repetitions the Italian came down the street,
sounding all the way a parley, till at last he was caught, held fast,
brought into the house, and the trumpet and buff jerkin restored to their
respective owners. As to the poor devil himself, he was an object of the
truest compassion. His eyes darted fire, he foamed at the mouth, and
raved like a bedlamite.</P>
<P>At the desire of his friend, the Italian was con∣veyed to his
bed, which, in a most emaciated con∣dition, he made shift to leave in
somewhat less than five weeks.</P>
