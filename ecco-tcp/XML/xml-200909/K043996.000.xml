<P>REMARKS CONCERNING THE ENCROACHMENTS ON THE RIVER THAMES NEAR DURHAM-YARD.</P>

<HEAD>TO THE Right Honourable the LORD MAYOR, THE Worshipful the ALDERMEN, AND THE COMMON-COUNCIL of the City of London.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD, AND GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>BEFORE the Legislature had entirely assented to the late Bill in favour of the Encroachments near Durham-Yard, the two following little Tracts, were drawn up with a view to prevent the Confirmation of that Injustice; but as they were not finished time enough to be Communica∣ted, with any hope of Success, to those Per∣sons
<PB N="iv" REF="3"/>for whose perusal they were at first in∣tended, I think it my Duty, in the next Place, to address them to you, as they parti∣cularly relate to the Rights and Property of the City of London.—When <HI>Property</HI> is taken away from the Ancient and Legal <HI>Proprie∣tors</HI> WITHOUT THEIR CONSENT, and vested in other Persons, <HI>even private individuals,</HI> as their <HI>own Property,</HI> for their <HI>own private</HI> ad∣vantage, by Parliamentary Authority, such a Precedent will render the <HI>Property</HI> of all Men as precarious as their <HI>Party interest,</HI> and will enlarge the dangerous System of Pub∣lic Corruption, by increasing the means of its baneful influence.—But this is not mere∣ly, a Political evil; it is also <HI>immoral and ir∣religious,</HI> in every point of view. To remove the Ancient Land Mark, or Boundary, is an <HI>accursed Crime</HI> according to the Laws of God; (compare Deut. xix. 14. xxvii. 17. Job xxiv. 2. Proverbs xxii. 28.) so that <HI>every kind of wilful Encroachment</HI> upon <HI>the Property</HI> of others, is, in some degree, tainted with this heinous Guilt.</P>
<P><PB N="v" REF="4"/>Times are bad enough, when such inva∣sions on Public or Private Property <HI>remain unpunished;</HI> but the <HI>moral State</HI> of any Nation is even deplorable, and their measure of ini∣quity may be said to be almost filled up, when such notorious Acts of Injustice meet with <HI>Public Encouragement,</HI> instead of <HI>repre∣hension;</HI> and when Trespassers are <HI>rewarded</HI> and <HI>gratified</HI> (to the Exclusion of the in∣jured Proprietor) with a <HI>Parliamentary Right</HI> even in the very Object, which tempted them to break the Laws and <HI>wrong</HI> their Neigh∣bours.</P>
<P>Many well meaning People do not seem to be aware of the bad tendency of this exam∣ple; and there is, therefore, the more neces∣sity that it should be pointed out and ex∣posed.</P>
<P>The injustice appeared to me so notori∣ous, after I had carefully considered the case, that I should have been <HI>inclined,</HI> as <HI>a Citizen of the World,</HI> to represent the mon∣strous <HI>immorality</HI> of <HI>rewarding,</HI> instead <HI>of Pu∣nishing, Trespassers,</HI> (lest the evil example
<PB N="vi" REF="5"/>should become epidemical and contagious in <HI>the World,</HI> which is already too corrupt) but <HI>as a Citizen of London</HI> it is even <HI>my Duty</HI> to do so in the present case: for when I took the Oath of Allegiance to the King, I was Sworn at the same time to <Q><HI>maintain the Franchises and Customs,</HI></Q> of the City of London to the utmost of my power (see the Oath of every Freeman<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>You shall swear, that ye shall be good and true to our Sovereign Lord King George, obeysant and obedient ye shall be to the Mayor and Ministers of this City. <HI>The Franchises and Customs thereof ye shall maintain, and this City keep harmless in that that in you is, &amp;c.</HI></Q></NOTE>) and therefore, as I hope I shall ever be faithful to the City of London, as well as true to our most gra∣cious Sovereign, I esteem it my indispensible Duty <HI>to both,</HI> for the sake of <HI>public Justice,</HI> to point out the <HI>illegality</HI> (as it appears to me) and dangerous tendency of <HI>Publicly reward∣ing the Trespassers on the Rights of this Great City</HI> with an <HI>exclusive</HI> Title to the very object of their temptation to Trespass.</P>
<P><PB N="vii" REF="6"/>The <HI>manner</HI> of making these Encroach∣ments (viz. by throwing Rubbish into the Water without any Fence to retain it) has been as hurtful to the River as the En∣croachments themselves, without affording the least probability of any one good effect, saving, or convenience whatsoever, to recommend it: <HI>a method</HI> unfavourable to every purpose, except the clandestine Designs of Trespassers, that the intended Pro∣jection of their Encroachments may not sur∣prize and alarm the Public before the Mis∣chief is carried into Execution: as for in∣stance;—if the space, which has lately been, thus gradually, stolen from the River near Durham Yard, had been previously marked off with Piles for the Boundaries of a Wharf, or with a Bank of large Chalk-Stones, or other hard Materials, not liable to be washed away, (as all Embankments on Navigable Rivers ought to be made) the Trespass would have appeared much more enormous at first than by this method, which rendered the
<PB N="viii" REF="7"/>Progress of the growing Encroachments less notorious and alarming.</P>
<P>Since these late Trespasses began, the Bed of the River (as I have been informed by several Watermen and others, who have been well acquainted with the River for many Years) is considerably increased in Height, which is certainly occasioned, in great measure, by the <HI>manner of Embanking</HI> above described.</P>
<P>But, I am sorry, my Lord and Gentlemen, to observe, that the City is as much to blame on this Account as the Encroachers; for my fellow Citizens, or some of them, have suf∣fered themselves to be persuaded, that this is the most eligible way of Embanking; and they have, therefore, <HI>adopted,</HI> or, at least, <HI>do al∣low</HI> the practice of this pernicious and <HI>slovenly</HI> Method, in those Parts, where the Embank∣ment is authorized; so that the City seems to betray her own Cause, as if she really intend∣ed, by setting this <HI>bad Example,</HI> to justify the like notorious Abuse near Durham-Yard; and, thereby, render the Progress and Iniquity of that growing Encroachment less conspicu∣ous
<PB N="ix" REF="8"/>and remarkable. It behoves the City to enquire how such an inconsistency began: for this <HI>rude, slovenly</HI> and <HI>unmechanical Measure</HI> could not have been adopted for the sake of saving <HI>either Time or Expence</HI> in the Work; because it, certainly, requires a much greater Quantity of Rubbish than would have been really necessary to fill up the Space intended to be embanked! And this to the manifest Detriment of the River! for the lighter Particles of the Rubbish are constantly washed away from the Banks, every Tide, both up and down the Stream; and must inevitably lodge at the Bottom of the River; because the Current runs, alternately, both Ways. And, for the same Reason, the boasted Scheme of <HI>contracting the Avenue of the River</HI> will not (it is manifest) prevent the gradual filling up of the Bed, because the Rubbish and Filth, that is washed away from the Banks at one Time of Tide, is liable to be brought back again at another; and so to be shifted, backwards and forwards, till the whole is gradually incorporated in a thick
<PB N="x" REF="9"/>heavy Loam at the Bottom of the River; which, at length, becomes too firm to be af∣fected or removed by the Current; and by this means the Bed will, probably, be so raised, in process of time, as to render the River to∣tally unfit for Navigation.</P>
<P>It is therefore, absolutely necessary (my Lord and Gentlemen) to put a Stop, as soon as possible, to this scandalous Practice (viz. of throwing Rubbish into the River without a Fence to retain it) whether the Embank∣ments are allowed to Proceed or not: but it is, certainly, more for the Interest of the City to <HI>cut new Docks</HI> and <HI>Recesses</HI> from the River, and <HI>to clear</HI> and <HI>deepen</HI> the old ones, than to <HI>Embank.</HI></P>
<P>There are likewise some other Abuses to which the alarming Increase of the River's Bed is, likewise, in some Degree, to be attri∣buted: for besides many other lesser En∣croachments that are continually making on both Sides the River, by enlarging the Banks with Rubbish, driving Piles, &amp;c. I am in∣formed, that Rubbish from Buildings, Re∣fuse
<PB N="xi" REF="10"/>from the Dye-houses, &amp;c. have some∣times been thrown out of Lighters into the River in the Night, in order to save the trouble and expence of carrying the load farther away.—I have been told this by se∣veral persons who have accidentally seen the like Trespasses.—It is therefore become ne∣cessary, for the future Preservation of this Noble River, that the City should offer a proper Reward to all Watermen and others, that shall give the first Information at Guild∣hall, or the Mansion-House, of any such En∣croachments or Misdemeanors in future. The Reward should be paid when the Offender is convicted; and might, perhaps, be defrayed out of the Fine for the Offence. And the Water-Bailiffs should, likewise, be rewarded in the same manner, whenever they shall have been vigilant enough to give the first Notice of any Misdemeanor. A proper Inquest of Citizens should be appointed out of each Ward by Rotation, or, else, be impanneled by the Sheriffs as a Jury (from time to time as there should be occasion) to examine the
<PB N="xii" REF="11"/>Complaints, as soon as any Informations are received. And the Assent or Leave of such an Inquest to any Encroachment, driving of Piles, &amp;c. should not be allowed to autho∣rize the same, or put a stop to further En∣quiry, lest they should be in any Degree in∣fluenced by private Solicitation, or be other∣wise tampered with; (which has sometimes been the Case on public Inquiries when Nuisances have been presented) but the final Determination should rest, as at present, with the Court of Common Council; and no Water-Bailiff, or other City Officer what∣ever, should have Power to excuse, or tolerate, the driving any Piles, or the least En∣croachment. For when such a Power is vested in any <HI>Officer,</HI> whose charge is of this nature, it is apt to destroy the intended utility of his <HI>Office;</HI> because the more Offences and Encroachments are committed, the more Fees and Christmas Compliments he will, probably, receive, and annually demand, as the Price of Toleration and Forbearance. The Office of Water Bailiff (though it affords an ample
<PB N="xiii" REF="12"/>Proof of the ancient Jurisdiction and Right of the City of London to the River Thames, yet) has been hitherto, in general, (I fear,) rather a means of authorizing Encroach∣ments, than of preventing them.</P>
<P>I do not mean to blame the Conduct of your Water Bailiff, or of any other Officer in particular; for Custom has so reconciled the giving of pecuniary Acknowledgments to the Water Bailiff for tolerating Encroach∣ments (as I have been informed), that the same are looked upon as the <HI>lawful</HI> and <HI>just Dues</HI> of his Office: and he does not clan∣destinely demand them, but openly, and, as it were, by the authority of the City; which receives of every such Officer, at his appoint∣ment, a very large sum of Money, for the Purchase of his Office, <HI>in Consideration of these Emoluments.</HI>—I say — <Q><HI>in Consideration of these Emoluments,</HI></Q> because the same must neces∣sarily <HI>be supposed</HI> to be known and under∣stood by <HI>the Sellers</HI> as well as <HI>the Buyers,</HI> at the Time of the Purchase, if the <HI>proper</HI> In∣come and Value of the Office be compared

<PB N="xiii" REF="14"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="xiv" REF="15"/>with the enormous Price that has, of late, been given for it. The <HI>Profits</HI> or <HI>Salary</HI> ought, therefore, to be made adequate in some other way, otherwise <HI>the City</HI> and not <HI>the Water-Bailiff</HI> must be blamed.</P>
<P>I ought not, however, to blame <HI>the City</HI> without endeavouring, at the same time, to obviate the Objection which some Per∣sons have lately urged against her on the same Account, viz. <Q>that by neg∣lecting to prevent Abuses and Encroach∣ments, she has forfeited her <HI>Right</HI> of Conservancy:</Q> but as I have already shewn, in the two little Tracts, sent herewith, that the City has <HI>a natural,</HI> as well as <HI>Legal Right</HI> to her Jurisdiction on the River, I need only add, further, that <HI>the like Plea</HI> of Forfeiture, if it were once admitted, would be equally effectual to deprive any Lord or Gentleman of his <HI>Family Estate and Patri∣mony;</HI> for there are but few Men, I fear who make so good a Use of their Possessions as they might, and ought; though there are very many, that would PRETEND <HI>to improve
<PB N="xv" REF="16"/>and dispose of the same more advantageously for the</HI> PUBLIC GOOD, if <HI>such a Plea</HI> was sufficient to justify an Attempt <HI>to dispossess the right Owner.</HI> But to return—I do not mean to blame the City <HI>for selling</HI> the Office of Water Bailiff; but, rather, for not publishing (before it is offered to sale) proper Conditions, Instruc∣tions, and Injunctions, to point out the Duties of the Office; and for not giving notice that the same is liable to the Penalty of Forfeiture for Mal-administration; in order that the Pur∣chaser may, thereby, be enabled to regulate his Conduct agreeable to the <HI>real Duty</HI> of his Office; and may know, that he forfeits his Place, if he, wilfully, tolerates <HI>the least En∣croachment.</HI> Were this Method observed, <HI>the selling</HI> of Places (I mean Places <HI>merely of Trust,</HI> that don't require great Learning and Science) would be, by far, the most eligi∣ble way of disposal; because Recommenda∣tions and great Interest are far from being <HI>certain Proofs</HI> of the most deserving Candi∣date; whereas the Purchase Money would be a <HI>certain</HI> and <HI>real Gain,</HI> as well as an
<PB N="xvi" REF="17"/>excellent <HI>Security</HI> for good Behaviour. But without such Instructions and Conditions the <HI>private Emolument</HI> of the <HI>Officer</HI> is too liable to interfere with the <HI>public Utility</HI> of the <HI>Office:</HI> whereas, by the Method which I have already submitted to your Consideration <HI>(viz. of offer∣ing Rewards for the first Discovery of Offen∣ces,)</HI> every Waterman would find it his In∣terest to take upon himself the Office of a <HI>diligent</HI> and <HI>inexorable Water-Bailiff,</HI> because the proposed Reward arises from the <HI>public Proof,</HI> instead of the <HI>Concealment</HI> and <HI>Tolera∣tion</HI> of Offences; and there would be too many of these <HI>voluntary Officers</HI> to be bribed to secrecy.</P>

<HEAD>REMARKS CONCERNING THE ENCROACHMENTS ON THE RIVER THAMES NEAR DURHAM-YARD. PART I.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="part">
<PB N="3" REF="19"/>
<HEAD><HI>PART I.</HI> Some Remarks on the Case of the City of London with respect to the Encroach∣ments on the River Thames near Durham-Yard, and the Bill now depending in Parliament <HI>to establish the said Trespasses.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IT cannot be denied, notwithstanding all the delusive Sophistry that hath been used upon this occasion, that the City of London hath ever enjoyed and exercised on the River Thames a Right of <HI>Conservancy,</HI> as well of the <HI>Width</HI> or <HI>Avenue,</HI> (by occasionally inspecting and regulating the Boundaries) <HI>as of the
<PB N="4" REF="20"/>Fishery,</HI> with power and authority to remove all nuisances; so that this Franchise, or Liberty, is absolutely vested in the City by <HI>Prescription and Ancient Usage,</HI> besides many positive <HI>Grants and Confirmations;</HI>—And what Freeholder will be able to produce a more authentic Title to his Estate and Property! For a long process of time, and a long Use, Possession, or Custom, which exceeds the Memory of Man, <HI>is sufficient to constitute a Right,</HI> or just Title. <Q>Longum Tempus et longus Usus, qui excedit memoriam homi∣num, <HI>sufficit pro jure.</HI></Q> Principia Legis et AEquitatis, p. 55. See also Co. Lit. 115. There is, besides, an express Article in Magna Charta to secure to the City of London <HI>all her Ancient Liberties and Customs</HI> (<Q>Civitas Londini habeat omnes libertates suas antiquas et
<PB N="5" REF="21"/>consuetudines suas.</Q> (Cap. 9.) a∣mongst which, undoubtedly, this Right and Custom of <HI>Conservancy</HI> is to be reckoned as one of the <HI>most material Franchises,</HI> because the <HI>very existence</HI> of this great Trading City depends upon it; so that the City's Title to the Con∣servancy is founded on <HI>a natural</HI> as well as <HI>legal Right.</HI></P>
<P>The pretended consent of the Col∣legiate Church of Westminster cannot palliate the Trespass, or lessen the in∣jury to the City of London. The Grant of King James, on which the Claim of that Church is said to be founded, could not convey <HI>a power to embank and fill up the River,</HI> nor a Right <HI>to confirm such a Trespass</HI> when committed, because the King himself had <HI>no such power,</HI> and consequently
<PB N="6" REF="22"/>had <HI>no right to Grant it;</HI> so that the Jurisdiction said to extend <Q><HI>infra finem aquoe to the middle of the Stream,</HI></Q> must be construed in some other sense, or it will, otherwise, render the <HI>whole Grant null and void;</HI> because the River Thames is <HI>a Public Avenue or Passage</HI> to the City; so that, in this respect, it is to be considered as the <HI>King's high∣way, and it</HI> is esteemed the King's high∣way no otherwise than in Trust for the Public: so that the King has no power to dispense with an <HI>Encroachment on the highway;</HI> for though <Q><HI>he may par∣don Nusances that are transient and not continuing,</HI></Q>—Yet <Q><HI>a Nusance in the highway, which still continues, and is not ended, until removed; can∣not be pardoned;</HI></Q> (Judge Vaughan's Reports, 333.) because <HI>the same is to be esteemed evil and iniquitous, in its very
<PB N="7" REF="23"/>nature, a "Malum in se, Bad in itself,"</HI> which is further proved by the same Learned Author in P. 337. <Q>I may conclude (says he) those things to be <HI>mala in se, which can never be made lawful.</HI></Q> He then cites the Year-Book of 11 Henry 7. viz. <Q>But <HI>Malum in se,</HI> the King nor any other can dispense.</Q> And instanceth, <Q>Si come, Si le Roy, voyloit pardon de occider un homme, <HI>ou de faire nusance in le haut chemin, ceo est void,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">To wit, if the King, should be willing to pardon the Killing of a Man, (or rather, as the next sentence explains it) <Q><HI>will</HI> GIVE POWER to <HI>kill a Man,</HI></Q> or to make <Q>a Nuisance in the High-Road, the same is void.</Q></NOTE> —and upon the same reason (says he) a license to imprison a Man, <HI>to take his Land,</HI> his Horse, or any <HI>thing
<PB N="8" REF="24"/>that is his from him, is void.</HI> For in <HI>Life, Liberty, and Estate,</HI> every Man, <HI>who hath not forfeited them,</HI> hath a Property and Right which the Law allows him to defend; and if it is violated, it gives an Action to re∣dress the Wrong, and to Punish the <HI>Wrong-doer</HI>—Therefore a <HI>Dispen∣sation,</HI> that is, to make lawful the taking from a Man any thing which he may lawfully defend from being taken, or lawfully punish if it be, <HI>must be void.</HI> For it is a contradic∣tion to make it <HI>lawful,</HI> to take what may be <HI>lawfully</HI> hindered from be∣ing taken, <HI>or lawfully Punished</HI> if it be. And that were to make <HI>two Men</HI> have several <HI>Plenary Rights in the same thing at the same time, which</HI> NO LAW CAN EFFECT: <HI>Therefore</HI> TO DO <HI>a thing which</HI> NO LAW <HI>can
<PB N="9" REF="25"/>make</HI> LAWFUL, <HI>must be</HI>—MALUM IN SE.</Q></P>
<P>This Argument clearly proves the Impropriety of pretending a Right or Power in the Crown, or in the Church of Westminster, to give their consent for the establishment of the Trespass in the River at Durham-Yard.</P>
<P>The Right of Conservancy has been invested in the City of London from the most ancient Times, so that the King cannot resume that Power if <HI>he would;</HI> for it is a maxim in Law, that a <HI>quiet and uninterrupted</HI> Possession for 60 Years creates a just Title. <Q><HI>Possessio pacifica pour Anns</HI> 60 <HI>facit Jus:</HI></Q> (See Judge Jenkins to the same effect Cent. 26.) and, the Kings Order, Command, or Letters Patent have
<PB N="10" REF="26"/>no legal Weight, or Effect against such a Right, for <Q><HI>rescriptum prin∣cipis contra jus non valet.</HI></Q> On the other hand, the Right of the Church of Westminster to the River (even supposing that it had been law∣ful for King James the first to grant such <HI>a Right</HI>) is nevertheless forfeited for want of being claimed and put in use since that time; whereas the Right of the Citizens of London is sufficiently established (according to the Maxims before cited) by the exercise and en∣joyment of a continual and undisputed Jurisdiction upon the River, as being their undoubted Right and Property, <HI>surely</HI> for more than 60 Years last past. —<HI>And a Right or Property, thus acquired,</HI> is as valid, even against the <HI>Pretensions of the Crown,</HI> as against those of the Church of Westminster, or, even, <HI>as
<PB N="11" REF="27"/>against those of a Private Man,</HI>—for the <HI>Nullum Tempus</HI> Doctrine cannot justify the King's Claim to the <HI>Soil</HI> of the Thames, because the Right of the Crown in Manors, Lands, Tene∣ments, &amp;c. is exactly upon the same footing <HI>with respect</HI> TO TIME <HI>as Private Freeholds;</HI> For Bracton informs us that in all such things— <Q><HI>currit tem∣pus contra Regem, sicut contra quam libet privatam personam.</HI></Q> (Bracton de legibus et consuetudinibus Angliae, 2d B. c. 5. P. 14.) I have thoroughly examined the Doctrine of <Q><HI>Nullum Tempus occurrit regi,</HI></Q> in a little Tract expressly upon that Subject, and there∣fore need not enlarge upon it here.</P>
<P>Now as the City of London has ac∣quired so firm a Title to her Jurisdiction by a quiet Possession for 60 Years, ac∣cording
<PB N="12" REF="28"/>to the Maxim before quoted, how unjust is it, at this time, to call her Right in Question, when it <HI>is noto∣rious,</HI> that the same may as easily be traced back more than 10<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the Charter of Richard 1st, C. 2d. cited in the Royal Charter of Confirmation by Charles the 2d, to the City of London, p. 9. <Q>We have clearly quit claimed all that which the Keepers of the Tower of London were wont Yearly to receive of the said Wares.</Q>—Speak∣ing of Wares in the Thames to the Detriment of the City; and this Charter is expressly said to have been given <Q>for the Soul's Health of King Henry our Father, and all our Ancestors Souls,</Q> probably meaning his Ancestors of the Norman Line, who had unjustly usurped those Rights. The Jurisdiction of the City of Lon∣don upon the River was soon after acknowledged also by his Brother King John. See his Charter cited in the Posthumous Works of Sir H. Spel∣man, p. 63. <Q><HI>Et Civitas</HI> Londinensis <HI>habeat omnes</HI> ANTIQUAS <HI>libertates et liberas consuetudines suas tam per Terras quam</HI> PER AQUAS.</Q>
<P>N. B. Even at that time they were esteemed, "ANTIQUAS <HI>Libertates,</HI> &amp;c.</P></NOTE> times 60 Years! For <HI>ex diuturnitate temporis omnia praesumuntur Solenniter esse acta.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="29"/>We are taught also by the <HI>unquestion∣able</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Whosoever denies the force and weight of the <HI>Maxims and Principles</HI> of the Common Law, is unworthy of Argument, and deserves not to be treated as a reasonable Being; for <Q>Con∣tra Negantem principia non est disputandum.</Q> Co. Lit. 343.</NOTE> <HI>Maxims</HI> of the Common Law that Men cannot be obliged to part with their <HI>Right and Property</HI> without their own free consent: <Q><HI>Iniquum est ingenuis hominibus non esse Liberam re∣rum suarum alienationem;</HI></Q>—And <Q><HI>Rerum suarum quilibet est moderator et arbiter.</HI></Q>—And again, <Q><HI>Regulariter non valet pactum de re mea non alie∣nanda</HI></Q>
<PB N="14" REF="30"/>(Co. Lit. 223.) For no Man may be compelled to sell what is his own, even for the full value of it. <Q><HI>Nemo cogitur rem suam vendere, etiam justo pretio.</HI></Q> 4 Inst. 275.—And again, That which is <HI>my own,</HI> cannot be taken from me <HI>without my consent;</HI> <Q><HI>Quod meum est, a me, sine me, auferri non potest.</HI></Q> Jenk. Cent. 251.</P>
<P>There is, indeed, an Exception to these general Maxims, and that is, when the <HI>Public Benefit</HI> requires such an Alienation, as for the making of Public Roads, Canals,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In all the Cases here mentioned it is neces∣sary that the <HI>Alienated Private Property</HI> should be vested <HI>in the Public,</HI> or <HI>in the Crown for the Public,</HI> and not as the <HI>private Property of any Individuals whatsoever,</HI> notwithstanding that <HI>the Public</HI> may seem to be benefited by their <HI>Private</HI> Undertak∣ings. Precedents of this kind have, indeed, been established by <HI>some late Acts</HI> for <HI>Cutting Canals;</HI> but I flatter myself, that the Legislature was not then aware of the impropriety of such examples. The Proposal of the City of London, for Cut∣ting a Canal from Isleworth upwards, was a proper pattern for all other Undertakings of that nature; because the Property was to be vested <HI>in the Public,</HI> and it was intended finally to be made <HI>a Free Navigation,</HI> so that, of course, it would have been considered, <HI>in Law,</HI> as <HI>the King's High∣way.</HI></NOTE> <HI>&amp;c.</HI> or Build∣ing

<PB N="16" REF="32"/>is made to <HI>establish the Trespass,</HI> and vest that <HI>Public Property</HI> in <HI>Private Hands,</HI> for <HI>Private Advantage, without the Consent of the Ancient and Legal Trustees,</HI> it is to reverse the very fun∣damental Principles of <HI>Natural Equity,</HI> and to turn the once firm Pyramid of the Law upon its Point, instead of <HI>its Basis,</HI> so as to threaten ruin and de∣struction to all things within the reach of its fall.—<HI>The Pretence,</HI> that the <HI>Public</HI> will be <HI>benefited</HI> in proportion to the advantage arising to the <HI>Trespassers,</HI> is frivolous, and ought not, by any means, to be admitted.

<PB N="17" REF="33"/>though <HI>the pretence</HI> for it is Lawful; <Q><HI>Pretextu liciti non debet admitti illi∣citum.</HI></Q> (10.

<P>Yet the City paid a proper Atten∣tion (it is manifest) to the merit of the Architects, and the Appearance of their Buildings, by discovering an In∣clination (which I have elsewhere mentioned more at large) to allow
<PB N="18" REF="34"/>them sufficient room to make a conve∣nient Wharf, that the Purposes of their noble Vaults might not be in∣jured; but, as more than this would be superfluous, the Citizens could not have been justified, had they not re∣jected the unconscionable request of the Trespassers, especially as it was thought, that the addition of a <HI>large Timber-Yard</HI> for the <HI>private Use and Advantage</HI> of the Builders, would not, (accord∣ing to the Taste of the Citizens at least) contribute much <HI>to public Orna∣ment and Elegance.</HI> The other <HI>pre∣tence</HI> of <HI>public Utility</HI> was as little ap∣parent to the Citizens in general as this last; for it is still <HI>doubtful,</HI> and re∣mains to be proved; (as I have shewn in another Paper;) whereas there is NO DOUBT <HI>of the illegality of the Trespass;</HI> for the same was notorious, as well
<PB N="19" REF="35"/>with respect to the Encroachment it∣self, as the manner of making it, by throwing so many Thousand Cart-loads of Rubbish into the River, without a Fence to retain it, which must, cer∣tainly, prejudice the River by lessening the Depth.—This was an apparent <HI>in∣jury,</HI> and, <Q><HI>an Injury is contrary to Law:</HI> Tort a le ley est <HI>contrary.</HI></Q> (Co.

<HEAD>REMARKS CONCERNING THE ENCROACHMENTS ON THE RIVER THAMES NEAR DURHAM-YARD. PART II.</HEAD>
<HEAD><PB N="27" REF="42"/><HI>PART II.</HI> Some further Remarks concerning the Injury done to the City of London by the Encroachments on the River Thames near Durham-Yard.</HEAD>
<P>THE extraordinary Favour shewn in Parliament to the Trespasses lately committed by several Persons, in the enormous Encroachment on the River Thames near Durham-Yard, is liable to affect the Security of Property in general; because an Encouragement to commit Trespasses, and a Precedent to establish and confirm the same, when committed, do certainly tend to the
<PB N="28" REF="43"/>Total Subversion of Justice; for in every point of view the same are repugnant to the fundamental Principles of Law and Equity.</P>
<P>Actions were commenced in the Court of King's Bench against the En∣croachments, <HI>before</HI> the Trespassers brought their Bill into Parliament; so that the Concurrence of Parliament with the Authors of the Injury, <HI>is a gross insult upon the Laws,</HI> by stopping the regular Course of Justice in <HI>a mat∣ter of Right,</HI> which came properly be∣fore the King's Courts; for, as it is esteemed unjust to punish a Man by the force of an <HI>ex post facto</HI> Law, it, certainly, is equally unjust by an <HI>ex post facto</HI> Law to confirm, and establish a <HI>manifest Trespass,</HI> which was previ∣ously referred to a proper Court for
<PB N="29" REF="44"/>Redress; and the Application to Par∣liament is of itself a sufficient Proof, that the Right and Claim of the City of London <HI>are just;</HI> and such as must necessarily have found <HI>a Remedy in Law,</HI> according to the usual Proceedings of the King's Courts, otherwise the <HI>ex post facto Law</HI> had been needless.</P>
<P>It ought to be remembered, also, that the City of London, for the sake of Peace, and to avoid a Contest in Parliament, was <HI>inclined</HI> to allow some of the Trespassers, (who are eminent Builders) as much ground in the Front of their Buildings, as would be suffi∣cient to make a Wharf, wide enough for Carts to come down, and to turn, and load, &amp;c. as at other Quays in the City, so that the use and intention of the noble underground Passages might
<PB N="30" REF="45"/>not be lost, or in the least injured; and a private intimation of this Lenity and Favour, to which the City seemed disposed, was given to a Friend of the Builders, that they might be advised to Petition the City for Room to make such a Wharf; and they were told, that the same would <HI>probably</HI> be granted in consideration of their great Expences, and the Grandeur of their Buildings.</P>
<P>But instead of <HI>such a Petition,</HI> the Builders presented a <HI>Memorial</HI> (they did not deign to call it <HI>a Petition</HI>) desiring more than 3 or 4 Times as much room as was necessary for the said purpose; because, it seems, a Wharf alone would not content them; but, <HI>as Builders,</HI> they must be indulged also with room enough, out of the Width of the Ri∣ver, to make (likewise for <HI>a Public
<PB N="31" REF="46"/>Ornament,</HI> I suppose) <HI>even a Timber Yard besides!</HI>—They did not, indeed, men∣tion <HI>the Timber Yard</HI> in their Memorial, but the design plainly appears by a Clause in the Bill to regulate <HI>the Height of the Piles of Timber,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>They did not fail, however, <HI>to demand</HI> of the City, as much Space as they thought necessary for <HI>their intended Tim∣ber Yard;</HI> and they were pleased at the same time to desire <HI>the Concurrence of the City (as Conservators of the River) to their Petition in Parliament!</HI> An Insult this to the Citizens of London, <HI>as gross and enormous, as the Encroachment itself;</HI>—for, in effect, it was to desire the Citizens to join in a Petition to Parlia∣ment <HI>against themselves;</HI> that is, in Fa∣vour of, and to establish and confirm a notorious Trespass committed in De∣fiance
<PB N="32" REF="47"/>of their own repeated Prohibi∣tions and Presentments.</P>
<P>The Memorial, however, was rejected with a proper Disdain. But this was no hindrance to the Adventurers; they were already <HI>sufficiently aware,</HI> that they might affront the City with Impunity.—They knew their <HI>Party</HI> Interest in Parliament, and <HI>the Partiality</HI> has, hitherto, been <HI>proved by the Success.</HI></P>
<P>Two great Law Lords strenuously en∣deavoured to palliate the Offence, and to set forth the Public Utility of the Em∣bankment: One of them admitted that, <Q>the present Scheme was intended for the private Emolument of Mess. A∣dams, but then, (said he) that Emolu∣ment could only increase in Proportion to the Convenience, and Public Uti∣lity
<PB N="33" REF="48"/>of the Embankment; if it was found inconvenient; the intended use would be lost; consequently their Profit would go with it; it was, therefore, in every point, a great Public Good arising from a Private Advantage.</Q> However plausible this Argument may seem, yet I must ob∣serve, that it ill becomes any Gentle∣man at the head of the Law, to view <HI>a Public Good</HI> through the medium <HI>of a Private Advantage,</HI> especially as that <HI>private advantage</HI> had been sought by <HI>a manifest Public Injury and Trespass;</HI> for when the Encroachment first be∣gan, the Right of the City of London was so far from being disputed, that the Trespassers themselves acknow∣ledged it, by Petitioning for Leave; and though they could not obtain Leave from those who had a Right to
<PB N="34" REF="49"/>give it, yet they continued to <HI>enlarge</HI> their enormous Trespass, as confident∣ly as if the whole River was indispu∣tably their own. But even if the ima∣ginary <HI>Public Good,</HI> (supposed by the learned Chief Justice) be admitted, yet his Lordship knows, that <Q>That which is otherwise Good and Just in itself, becomes Wicked and Unjust, if it is sought or obtained by Force or Fraud. <HI>Quod alias bonum &amp; justum est, si per vim vel fraudem petatur, malum et injustum efficitur.</HI></Q> (3 C. 78.) and his Lordship will not (I appre∣hend) deny, that <HI>an enormous Trespass</HI> has been committed; and therefore, those that are robbed and injured ought, <HI>before all things, to be reinstated,</HI> and have their Rights restored. <Q>Spo∣liatus debet <HI>ante omnia restitui.</HI></Q> 2 Iust. 714. Law, Justice, and Equity,
<PB N="35" REF="50"/>cannot shew the least favour or consi∣deration for the Delinquents in such a Case, because <HI>"Iniquity Bars Equity,"</HI> —and, <Q>no Man can take advantage from his own Trespass or Injury. <HI>Nullus commodum capere potest de in∣juria sua propria.</HI></Q> Co. Lit. 148.</P>
<P><Q>The Public Good requires that bad Actions should not remain un∣punished. <HI>Interest Reipublicae ne ma∣leficia remaneant impunita.</HI></Q> Jenk. Cent. p. 31.</P>
<P>But if, on the contrary, the Legisla∣ture will favour and confirm an appa∣rent Trespass, no Man's Property can be safe from such Adventurers. If I had <HI>as much Party Interest,</HI> and paid as little <HI>regard to the difference between</HI> MEUM <HI>and</HI> TUUM as they have done
<PB N="36" REF="51"/>in the present Case, <HI>or their Advocates,</HI> I would procure an elegant Plan for raising such a Building, as should not only be a Public Ornament in its struc∣ture, but a Public Convenience in its Accommodations within and without; in short, I would build a noble Inn, open <HI>to all Men, (for</HI> MY OWN <HI>and the public advantage</HI>) upon the Inheritance of Lord A, Lord B, or of any other Noble Freeholder whatsoever, whose Property, in point of Situation, might seem to promise the most advantage to my undertaking.</P>
<P>Or a good Plan for raising an Elegant <HI>and outwardly</HI> Ornamental Edifice, <HI>inwardly</HI> adapted to the purposes of <HI>Grinding Corn, Slitting Iron, making Gunpowder,</HI> or any other Articles necessary for the suste∣nance,
<PB N="37" REF="52"/>convenience, or protection of <HI>the Public,</HI> would equally answer my <HI>private Advantage:</HI> and <HI>a good Mill</HI> would be <HI>a good Inheritance,</HI> let me tell you, if I could make it <HI>my own Freehold</HI> wherever I pleased to Build one, <HI>with or without</HI> the Consent of the Lord of the Manor, or the lawful Proprietor of the Ground.</P>
<P>The same Doctrine may be extended even to the Building of <HI>whole Towns upon other Mens Ground, without Leave;</HI> because the Towns would be for the ac∣commodation of Gentlemen, of Trades∣men, of Manufacturers, Artificers, <HI>&amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</HI> whereby <HI>the Public</HI> would manifestly be benefited as well as <HI>the Builder, in proportion</HI> to the Success of each Undertaking in the Increase of Inhabitants.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="53"/>If the lawful Proprietor of the Ground, on which <HI>I trespassed,</HI> would be pleased to give me his Consent, it would be well; and if he refused it, <HI>my Pretensions would still be as good as the much favoured Cause of the Trespassers at Durham-Yord;</HI> for, even though I should be obliged to allow that my present Scheme <Q><HI>was intended for the Private Emolument</HI> of,</Q> myself—yet I could alledge the Opinion of a Chief Justice, that <Q><HI>this Emolument could only increase in proportion to the Con∣venience and Public Utility of,</HI></Q> my Inn, my Mill, or my Town, <Q><HI>If it was found inconvenient, the intended Use would be lost, consequently,</HI>" my <HI>Profit would go with it; it would therefore</HI></Q> (according to this Opinion of my Lord Chief Justice) <Q><HI>be in
<PB N="39" REF="54"/>every point a great</HI> PUBLIC GOOD, <HI>ari∣sing from a</HI> PRIVATE ADVANTAGE.</Q></P>
<P>I might alledge, also, that this <HI>pri∣vate Advantage</HI> of mine, ought to be much more favoured than that of the Encroachers on the River Thames, because, if I should raise my Prices for Provisions, for Grinding, for Rent, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> upon the Public, there would still be Room sufficient in the Neighbour∣hood, (<HI>as the Consent of Proprietors</HI> is <HI>at present esteemed unnecessary</HI>) for other People, also, to <HI>Trespass</HI> and Build more Inns, more Mills, or more Towns <HI>for</HI> THEIR OWN <HI>and the Public Advantage,</HI> as near to my advantageous Situation as they should think proper; so that the Public, when <HI>imposed upon by me,</HI> might be enabled to give the pre∣serence to cheaper and less uncon∣scionable Trespassers.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="55"/>But in the other Case, the local Ad∣vantages are more limited and confined to a particular Situation; and the <HI>En∣croachments are already so great,</HI> that there is scarcely Room for more within any advantageous Distance; be∣cause the Advantage of Situation <HI>for Wharfs</HI> is confined within the extent of the Trading Part of the Town, now fully occupied; <HI>and the Port or Bason of the River,</HI> within these Bounds, is already too much contracted to admit of <HI>more Encroachments,</HI> without encum∣bering or stopping up <HI>the Passage of the River</HI> with Craft and Vessels, which even at present are greatly endangered for want of commodious and proper Mooring-Places out of the Stream and Tide-way.—During the Frosty Wea∣ther this last Winter, 3 or 4 Ships were wrecked, and many others damaged,
<PB N="41" REF="56"/><HI>even in the Port of London,</HI> for want of such proper Accommodations; and a very considerable number of Barges, Lighters, &amp;c. were forced away from their Moorings by the Ice, and lost, both above and below London Bridge; so that it is manifest, that <HI>Water-room</HI> is of much more consequence to the Port of London than any Land gained from it can possibly be; and that there cannot, therefore, be any Room to spare, for making more Wharfs out of the Bed of the River, without <HI>an ap∣parent Injury to the Harbour;</HI> so that if the new Wharfs should become ab∣solutely necessary by an Increase of Trade, <HI>the Public Utility</HI> must submit to the Exactions of the <HI>Private Posses∣sor,</HI> whose Tenure is founded in <HI>Pub∣lic Injury and Injustice;</HI> and the Trade of this great City, on which its <HI>very
<PB N="42" REF="57"/>Existence depends,</HI> must be Loaded and Clogged with <HI>the much favoured Pri∣vate Advantage</HI> of <HI>each Trespasser;</HI> so that we may fairly measure, by the Enormity of the present Encroach∣ments, <HI>how conscientiously Trespassers in general</HI> would deign to consider the Trade and Rights of <HI>the Public,</HI> when their own <HI>Private Interest</HI> is in View.</P>
