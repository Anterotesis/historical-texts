<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>MY adoption of the word <HI>Pater,</HI> in the Hexham Inscription, engraved, and facing page 91, vol. I. having been objected to by an anonymous writer, in order to shew it was by no means improper or singular, I beg leave to refer the reader to the 2d volume of the Archaeologia, page 190, where in the <HI>Sa∣lisbury Inscription</HI> commented on by <HI>Mr Gough,</HI> the words are <HI>Pater Ecclesiae Salisbiriensis;</HI> and that writer gives it the antiquity of the beginning of the 12th century, the supposed personage for whom that tomb was erected, Roger third Bishop of Salisbury, having been elected A. D. 1102 to that See. <Q>His munifi∣cence to his infant church intitled him to the name of Pater Ecclesiae Salisbiriensis,</Q> are his words. The aera and occasion agree critically in the two instances: others might be pointed out; but this, from its pertinence, may seem sufficient.</P>
<P>In my account of <HI>Blanchland,</HI> page 119, by former writers I was led into an error, touching the family of Forsters, to whom it formerly appertained. This, I presume, will appear to be duly rectified, in the account of Bambrough, in this volume.</P>
<P>The liberal minded reader, I flatter myself, will make allowances for such errors as appear in this work, which, consistent with its title, is <HI>a View</HI> of the County.</P>

<P>WE repassed the <HI>Tweed</HI> by <HI>Coldstream Bridge,</HI> a handsome structure of seven arches, having had</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>WARK CASTLE</HEAD>
<P>in view for several miles of our passage down the banks of the river: a small part of it standing, forms a rude pillar, which at a distance ap∣pears of some consequence. A platform lays to the west, with a trench called <HI>Gully's Nich;</HI> a mean village to the east, from whence you ap∣proach the castle. This fortress stood on a circular eminence, formed by art: its founder is not positively known, nor is any certain date fixed to it. In Leland's Collectanea, part 1. p. 531. it is said, <Q>King Henry the 2 causid the Castel of Werke to be made.</Q> From several circumstances of history, it appears, that it was formidable so early as the beginning of the 12th century.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Werke Castel on the southe syd of Twede. A praty towne there.—Lel. Itin. v. 7. p. 54.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="4"/>Near this place are several intrenchments, some of which are de∣fended by mounds of earth.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">These mounds have a trench cross the crown of each.</NOTE> There is a spot adjoining called the <HI>Battle Place;</HI> but from what particular event it obtained that denomi∣nation is not known. As being on the borders, this castle was subject to repeated assaults.</P>
<P>On King Stephen's usurpation of the English crown, David of Scot∣land, with great indignation, entered the borders, and among other fortresses assaulted and took <HI>Carrum,</HI> which Richard of Hexham says was by the English called <HI>Werk.</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">This is an error in the Historian, the places are distinct, and separate a considerable distance.</NOTE> On a treaty held whilst Stephen lay at <HI>Durham</HI> and David at <HI>Newcastle,</HI> these conquests were restored by the Scotch King, who took as a compensation, <HI>Carlisle</HI> and some other places of less import, as additions to the <HI>Earldom of Huntington,</HI> which was then ratified to him: Stephen also engaged, that before any dispo∣sition was made of the <HI>Earldom of Northumberland,</HI> he would cause the claim of Henry (David's son) thereto, in right of his mother, to be fairly heard by his Judges. David received in marriage, from King Henry I. of England, his brother-in-law, Maud, the eldest daughter of Waltheof Earl of Northumberland, from whom Henry his son de∣rived his pretensions to that Earldom. Henry, by the resignation of his father, and King Stephen's ratification, held the Earldom of Hunting∣ton.</P>
<P>The determination of Henry's claim to Northumberland being sus∣pended, and Stephen unwilling to bring it to a fair discussion, sensible of the great power it would give to the Scotch crown, irritated David to support his son's pretensions by force of arms. Stephen's absence in Normandy favoured his purpose; and soon after Easter, in the year 1137, he levied a great army, with intent to invade England. The northern Barons, with Thurstan Archbishop of York, assembled the English forces at Newcastle; and the Archbishop proceeding to Rox∣burgh, then in the possession of the Scotch King, in conference with David and his son, prevailed on them to enter into a truce till Stephen's return, when it was presumed the matter in contest would be honour∣ably accommodated: but Stephen persisting in a denial of Henry's right, war immediately ensued.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="5"/>The winter was set in, when David, flattered with hopes of an in∣surrection in England, a plot <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ordericus Vitalis.—L. 13. p. 912.</NOTE> having been laid to massacre all the <HI>Normans,</HI> and deliver the kingdom to him, who was nearest heir in the <HI>Saxon line,</HI> not regarding the rigour of the season, dispatched his ne∣phew William, son of Duncan, with part of his army, against the Castle of Wark.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Richard of Hexham, John of Hexham.—Redpath's Border History.</NOTE></P>
<P>William invested this fortress early in the morning, and David with a numerous army and engines of war, advanced soon afterwards to maintain the siege. This investiture continued three weeks, during which time the most vigorous assaults were sustained by the garrison, under command of Jordan de Bussis, nephew of Walter D'Espec, Lord of Wark.<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><P>Walter D'Espec had great estates in Yorkshire, and was founder of the Abbey of Rievalle, which he filled with Monks from St. Barnard. The scite of this abbey is by ancient writers de∣scribed to be melancholy and desert, on a tract of land called Blackowmor, on the banks of the river Rie, from whence the monastery had the name of Rievalle. Rie empties itself into Derwent. The abbey, of which there are fine remains to this day, stands near Helmsley, in Yorkshire. We find a particular description of Walter D'Espec given by Ethelred or Ailred, second Abbot of Rievalle, an elegant and spirited writer, in his History of the Battle of the Standard. He is there represented as a person of the first eminence and esteem in the English army, harangu∣ing them before the battle from the carriage in which the famous standard was erected. <Q>Vir senex et plenus Dierum, acer ingenio, in Consiliis prudens, in Bello Amicitiam Sociis, fidem sem∣per Regibus servans.

<P>An account of the dispositions made by both armies before the battle known by the name of <HI>Bellum Standardi,</HI> as collected from Historians of character, may not be disagreeable to the reader in this place, though not pertinent to this work.</P>
<P>This expedition of <HI>David</HI>'s was unfortunate to the <HI>Scotch:</HI> they were joined by <HI>Eustace Fitz-John Lord of Alnwick,</HI> who resented <HI>Stephen</HI>'s taking from him <HI>Bambrough,</HI> and who hoped to have regained that fortress by the arms of the Scottish King. The <HI>castle</HI> sustained the assault of the whole army, and remained impregnable. <HI>David</HI> with fire and sword laid waste the country to <HI>Durham,</HI> where he was joined by the men of <HI>Galloway, Cumberland,</HI> and <HI>Carlisle,</HI> augment∣ing his army so, that it consisted of 26,000 men at the least. He was opposed near <HI>Northaller∣ton</HI> by a much smaller number, chiefly consisting of the nobles and men of Yorkshire, headed by their <HI>Archbishop Thurston,</HI> whose presence animated them to the highest pitch of bravery. The mast of a ship, having on its top a cross, wherein was the consecrated host in a silver pix, and the banners of St. Peter, St. John of Beverley, and St. Wilfrid of Ripon waving below it, was erected on the beam of a vast chariot. Around this standard, and some of them upon the carriage on which it stood, were placed the more aged of the English Barons, and with these <HI>Roger de Moubrai</HI> the infant Earl of <HI>Northumberland. Roger</HI> was the son of <HI>Negel de Albanei,</HI>
<PB N="4" REF="6"/>who at the battle of <HI>Tinchebrai,</HI> in Normandy, took Duke Robert prisoner; for which and other great services, King Henry rewarded him by a gift of the lands of <HI>Robert de Moubrai</HI> Earl of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> which had been forfeited on account of his rebellion against William Rufus. His presence drew around him all his vassals, who made no inconsiderable part of the English army. Immediately before the battle, <HI>Ralph Bishop of the Orkneys,</HI> deputed by the aged and infirm <HI>Thurstan,</HI> having assured the army that by fighting bravely they would purchase the remission of their sins, did, on receiving their confessions, actually pronounce their absolution, joining to it his benediction; at the same time the priests in their white vestments carrying crosses and relics, went among the ranks, encouraging the soldiers by their exhortations and prayers. These pious acts were accompanied with a wise arrangement of the English warriors, adapted to sustain and repel the first fierce onset of their enemies. The <HI>Abbot of Rievalle</HI> re∣lates, that <HI>David</HI> was prevented making the disposition he intended by the obstinacy of the <HI>Gall<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>waymen,</HI> who claimed it as their right to fight in the van, a station which <HI>David</HI> and his best officers perceived they were not fit for, on account of their wanting heavy armour, such as was borne by those who stood in the first rank of the English army. The King however fear∣ing sedition, at a time when it might have proved so fatal, was obliged to grant these troops their request. The next line was commanded by <HI>Prince Henry,</HI> consisting, as <HI>Aulred</HI> says, of knights and archers, or according to <HI>Huntington,</HI> of English and Norman horsemen, who be∣longed to his father's household, and with them the men of <HI>Cumberland</HI> and <HI>Tiviotdale.</HI> In this division was also <HI>Eustace Fitz-John.</HI> The third line consisted of the <HI>Laodomains</HI> with the <HI>Islanders</HI> and <HI>Lavernans.</HI> The King had in his own line the <HI>Scots</HI> and <HI>Murraymen,</HI> and for his body guard a band of English and Scotch Knights. <HI>Robert Brus</HI> and <HI>Bernard Baliol,</HI> both of whom, besides the great estates they possessed in England, did also hold lands of the Scottish King, went to him before the battle, and endeavoured to persuade him to retire, assuring him that <HI>Northumberland</HI> should be delivered to his son <HI>Henry;</HI> but not being able to prevail, they renounced their fealty to <HI>David,</HI> and returned to fight under the English standard."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Richard Hagulst.—Ailz.

<P><PB N="4" REF="6"/>David was obliged to raise the siege with disgrace; his forces were much reduced, and his Standard-bearer fell among the slain. The bor∣der conflicts were all after one mode, rendered horrible by ravage and rapine. David, after his departure from before <HI>Wark,</HI> led his forces to the western parts of Northumberland, where he spread desolation and ruin, and marked his progress as far as Tyne with acts of savage cruelty.</P>
<P>To oppose these invaders, Stephen at the head of a numerous army advanced to <HI>Wark,</HI> which obliged David to abandon Northumberland, and prepare to defend his own territories: but Stephen, apprized of a plot which was laid to entrap him at <HI>Roxburgh,</HI> returned to England without effecting any thing against his enemy. David seeing the Eng∣lish forces had abandoned the border, after taking and demolishing <HI>Norham,</HI> advanced against <HI>Wark,</HI> to revenge an insult the garrison had committed, by taking some baggage, and giving annoyance to his troops, marching under his son Henry. His success in this second at∣tempt was no better than in his former assault; he exerted his powers, employed every engine the art of war had introduced, and with much
<PB N="5" REF="7"/>
bloodshed persisted in the siege; till conceiving the fortress was im∣pregnable to every other manoeuvre than a blockade, which could cut off provisions and reinforcement, he determined thereon; and march∣ing southward with the main body of his army, left there a circumval∣lation of troops, under the care of two of his Barons.</P>
<P>David soon after had a dreadful defeat near <HI>Northallerton,</HI> at the <HI>Battle of the Standard;</HI> after which he retreated with the shattered remains of his troops to <HI>Carlisle,</HI> through a country enraged at the barbarities he had been guilty of in his former incursion: the peasants in every avenue revenging on his flying troops, the sufferings their families had sus∣tained. After a short respite, and a collection of his scattered army at <HI>Carlisle,</HI> he commanded the siege of <HI>Wark</HI> to be resumed, in which many new-invented engines and machines were employed. The be∣sieged with unparallelled fortitude sustained the shock: their skilfulness is as admirable as their courage, for they lost but one Knight, whose in∣trepidity in attacking a machine, exposed him to numbers of assailants, in the midst of whom he fell, after testifying the highest human valour. The slaughter made by the garrison was terrible; insomuch that David, relaxing his rigorous command, ceased all assaults, and again formed a strong blockade. The garrison were reduced to great extremities; they had killed their horses, and salted their flesh for food, and when that was nearly consumed, resolved, as soon as all provision was exhausted, to make a general sally, and cut their passage through the lines of the assailants, or die sword in hand. During this interval, <HI>Walter D'Espec,</HI> their Lord, willing to preserve so brave a corps, sent the Abbot of Rie∣valle with his command, that the garrison should surrender the place: on whose arrival a treaty was entered into, in consequence of which the garrison capitulated, and were permitted to march out of the castle un∣der arms, with 20 horses provided them by the Scotch King. On this evacuation, the castle was demolished, and the fortifications were rased.</P>
<P><HI>King Henry</HI> II. to strengthen the frontiers of his kingdom against the Scots, ordered the fortifications of the castle of <HI>Wark</HI> to be restored.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A.D. 1158, Iterum firmatum est castellum de Werk praecepto Regis. Lel. Collecta. 206.</NOTE></P>
<P><HI>King John,</HI> in the year 1215, in resentment of the defection of the northern Barons, who had done homage to Alexander II. at <HI>Mailross,</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="8"/>
advanced to the borders, and, amongst other places, reduced <HI>Wark</HI> to ashes. M. Paris gives the following account of this horrid expedition: <Q>Deinde Rex Ira succensus, vehementi apud partes Scotiae tendebat cismarinas, et captis Castris de Berwic, et aliis quae videbantur inex∣pugnabilia, improperavit Regi Alexandro, et quia erat Rufus, signi∣cavit ei, dicens, sic sic fugabimus rubeam vulpeculam latibulis suis, multum igitur ibidem stragem et exterminium exercuisset, nisi eundem necessitas magna dilationem non capiens revocasset.</Q></P>
<P><HI>King Edward,</HI> on the breach of fealty by John Baliol, in the year 1296, having levied a great army, advanced towards the Scotch bor∣ders; and halting at <HI>Bamburgh,</HI> received intelligence that Robert de Ross, Lord of <HI>Wark,</HI> had abandoned his castle, and gone over to the Scots, being enamoured of a Scotch woman, whose affection he pre∣ferred to his duty and allegiance: his brother William remaining in the fortress, dispatched a messenger to require immediate aid of the King, as he apprehended Robert would attempt to deliver <HI>Wark</HI> to the enemy. King Edward immediately ordered 1000 men to march to sustain William and his garrison, who, on their arrival, were attacked in their quarters in the night, in a small village called <HI>Prestfeu,</HI> by Ro∣bert de Ross, with a detachment from <HI>Roxburgh,</HI> who burnt the village, and put the reinforcement to the sword. King Edward soon after this disaster marched with his whole army to <HI>Wark,</HI> where he continued to celebrate the festival of Easter.</P>
<P>In the reign of King Edward II. 1318, <HI>Wark</HI> was taken by the Scots, under King Robert Brus, by assault. In Leland's Collecta. p. 548, it is said, that the Scottes came into the Marches of England, and de∣stroyed the castelles of Wark and Harbottle.</P>
<P>As King David Bruce with his victorious army was returning from Durham in the summer of the year 1341, where he had imbrued his hands in the horrid massacre of all ages and both sexes, had spoiled and plundered the sacred places, and put the religious to miserable deaths, the rear of his army passing the castle of <HI>Wark</HI> loaden with spoils, were seen by the garrison with the greatest indignation. Sir William Mon∣tague was then Governor, and the Countess of Salisbury, whose Lord the fortress then belonged to, resided there. The Governor with 40 horsemen made a sally, attended with considerable slaughter, bringing into the castle 160 horses laden with booty. King David, incensed at
<PB N="7" REF="9"/>
this insult, led his army against the castle, and made a general assault, but met with a repulse attended with great bloodshed. David then prepared to fill up the ditches, and bring his battering engines to play upon the walls: the imminent danger of the garrison rendered it neces∣sary to send information of their situation to the English Monarch, who was approaching the borders with a considerable army. The place be∣ing close invested, rendered such an attempt perilous, but it was ef∣fected by the Governor himself, on a fleet horse, in the darkness and tumult of a stormy night: he passed through the enemy's lines, and carried intelligence to King Edward, who redoubled his speed to relieve the place. The Scotch Chieftains, unwilling to hazard the treasures they had reaped in their expedition, persuaded the King to raise the siege and pass the Tweed; which was done only six hours before the van of the English army appeared. The joy of the Countess of Salisbury for this relief, and her pleasing deportment whilst she entertained the King at Wark, were the beginning of an amour, to which the famous institution of <HI>the order of the Garter</HI> is said to owe its origin.</P>
<P>In the reign of King Richard II. 1383,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A. D. 1383 &amp; 7 Rich. Scotti ceperunt castellum de Werk super Fluv Twede &amp; depraedatum incenderunt. Lel. Collecta. 252.</NOTE> it was besieged by the Scots, and part of the fortifications destroyed.</P>
<P>Soon after the accession of King Henry IV. the truce made with Richard II. expiring, the Scots made an incursion, in which they took the castle of Wark, and after holding it some time, utterly demolished the works. It was a fortress of too much consequence to be neglected, and therefore we find it soon after restored and in a state of defence: for in the same reign it sustained many shocks, with various degrees of fortune. In 1419, in the absence of the King of England, who was then in France, hostilities being commenced on the borders, William Haliburton of Fast Castle took the castle of <HI>Wark,</HI> which was then in the keeping of Robert Ogle, and put all the garrison to the sword; but it was soon recovered by the English, who, from a perfect knowledge of the place, made their way by a sewer which led from the kitchen into the Tweed, and surprizing the garrison, put them all to death, in revenge for their cruelty on Ogle's troops.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="10"/>In the reign of Henry VI. 1460, the Scots gathered great booty on the Marches, and among many other castles which they assailed, <HI>Wark</HI> was taken and demolished.</P>
<P>The castle was afterwards repaired by the Earl of Surry, and in the year 1523, in the 15th year of the reign of King Henry VIII. the Scotch army laying at Coldstream, resolved to attempt the reduction of <HI>Wark,</HI> under the command of the Duke of Albany, Sir John Lisle be∣ing then Governor. Buchanan the Historian, being present at the siege, gives the following description of the castle: <Q>In the innermost area was a tower of great strength and height; this was encircled by by two walls, the outer including a large space, into which the inha∣bitants of the country used to fly, with their cattle, corn, and flocks, in time of war; the inner of much smaller extent, but fortified more strongly by ditches and towers. It had a strong garrison, good store of artillery and ammunition, and other things necessary for defence.</Q> The Duke of Albany sent against it battering cannon, and a chosen band of Scots and French, to the number of 4000, under the command of Andrew Ker of Fairnherst. The French carried the outer inclosure at the first assault, but they were dislodged by the garrison setting fire to the corn and straw laid up therein. The besiegers soon recovered it, and by their cannon effected a breach in the inner wall. The French with great intrepidity mounted the breach, sustaining great loss by the shot of those who possessed the tower or keep, and being warmly re∣ceived by the forces that defended the inner ballium, were obliged to retire after a great slaughter. The attack was to be renewed the suc∣ceeding day, but a fall of rain in the night, which swelled the Tweed, and threatened to cut off the retreat of the assailants to the main army, and the approach of the Earl of Surry, who before lay at Alnwick with a large force, obliged the Duke to relinquish his design, and repass the Tweed.</P>
<P>The present remains of <HI>Wark</HI> do not in any wise strike the traveller with an idea of so formidable a fortress, as it assuredly was for many centuries. At what time it was dismantled, and thus totally destroyed, I have not been able to learn; but it is probable it was one of the strong∣holds ordered to be demolished by King James VI. of Scotland, on his accession to the crown of England.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="11"/>The great convention for the settlement of the tenths demanded by King Henry II. in the year 1188, was held at <HI>Brigham,</HI> near <HI>Wark.</HI> Hugh Bishop of Durham was the chief of King Henry's Envoys, and was met by King William the Lion of Scotland, his Bishops, Earls, Barons, and a vast concourse of inferior vassals, when the Scotch re∣jected the demand with the utmost contempt. In the year 1549, we read of <HI>Wark</HI> receiving the Earl of Rutland and his army after their Scotch expedition.</P>
<P><HI>Wark</HI> was the barony and ancient possession of the family of Ross.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Robertus Ros tenet Baroniam de Werk. Lel. Col. 200.</NOTE> <HI>William de Ross</HI> was a competitor for the Crown of Scotland in the 20th year of King Edward I. and was one of those Lords who, in 1301, pro∣tested against the supremacy of the See of Rome over Scotland.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P><HI>Robert de Ross,</HI> one of this family, with <HI>John de Baliol,</HI> were guardians of <HI>Alexander</HI> King of Scotland, on his marriage with <HI>Margaret</HI> eldest daughter of <HI>King Henry</HI> III. of whom the following unaccountable anecdote gained acceptation:—<Q>That they were guilty of injurious conduct towards their charge, by denying them social intercourse: on the information of an English Physician, they were punished; Baliol by a large sum in mulct, and Ross by confis∣cation of his estates.

<P>Here was an <HI>Abbey</HI> of Black Canons, subordinate to <HI>Kirkham</HI> in York∣shire. In the 24th year of King Edward I. it was burnt by the Scots, then led by Wallace, whose encampment gave name to an adjacent field. In Edward's letter to Pope Boniface, he describes their cruelties in a most horrible manner; <Q>The Scots inhumanly de∣stroyed an innumerable multitude of his subjects, burnt monasteries, churches, and towns; with an unpitying and savage cruelty, slew infants in their cradles, and women in child-bed, barbarously cut off womens breasts, and burnt in a school, whose doors they first built

In the 44th year of King Edward III. 1370, Sir John Lilburn was defeated by the Scots near this place, under the command of Sir John Gordon, who was returning from an incursion with many prisoners, and a great train of cattle: the engagement was fierce, and its decision long doubtful, the Scots being driven from their ground and returning again five several times. In the end Sir John and his brother were made prisoners.</P>

<HEAD>CORNHILL,</HEAD>
<P>noted for the valuable <HI>Spaws</HI> near it. By the escheats of the 1st year of King Edward I. we find this place mentioned as the possession of <HI>William de Cornhill.</HI> The <HI>castle of Cornhill,</HI> I presume, was the fort or tower, near Cornhill Bridge, and opposite to <HI>Linnel House.</HI> The remains are surrounded with a ditch, called the <HI>Castle Stone Nich.</HI> It has been well situated for defending the passage over the river. Here is a seat house of <HI>Henry Collingwood, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR></HI> commanding a view of the ground we had traversed on the north side of Tweed, extended to the Helton Moun∣tains; and on the southern side of the river having a prospect of a wide country, over which many Gentlemen's seats are dispersed, the whole closed by a range of mountains, of which Cheviots are supreme. In 1549, on an incursion of the Scots, they took the castle of Cornhill, described as being an old house of considerable strength,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ridpath's Border History.</NOTE> and a valu∣able booty was gained.</P>
<P>In 1751, in pulling down Cornhill chapel, there was found, about three feet lower than the old foundation, a coffin of stone, about eight feet long, in which were two urns of coarse pottery, and the shank bones and scull of a person of great size.</P>
<P>South-east of <HI>Cornhill</HI> is a remarkable encampment, but to what people or to what particular event they appertained, I have gained no certain information. The several lines are of great extent, but as they form no regular figure, in their present state, do not merit a par∣ticular description: what is worthy of notice, is the mode in which the
<PB N="12" REF="14"/>
works are defended, by ranges of conic eminences; a thing singular, and what rather confounds my judgment as to the antiquity of the place, and who were its occupants. Mr Wallis says they are sepulchral Tumuli; from which opinion I must beg leave to dissent.</P>
<P>In Branxton West Field is a column, placed as a memorial of the battle fought there on the 9th of September, in the 5th year of the reign of King Henry VIII. called the battle of <HI>Flodden Field,</HI> from the Scotch encampment on Flodden Hill. The disposition of the Earl of Surry's forces was such, as to oblige the Scotch to come to an en∣gagement, their retreat into their own country being cut off.</P>
<P>James IV. had wasted much time at <HI>Ford,</HI> captivated, as it is said, by the beauties of the daughter of <HI>Sir William Heron,</HI> so as give the <HI>Earl of Surry</HI> time and opportunity for advancing towards the borders with a large army. The Scottish Nobles were averse to hazarding a battle, and strenuously insisted on the policy of their return into their own country, loaded as they were with spoils, and having gathered many laurels in their campaign: but <HI>James,</HI> fired with resentment at the challenges sent by <HI>Surry,</HI> determined to engage the English, and for that purpose made choice of an advantageous situation for his army, in the neighbourhood of <HI>Ford.</HI> The eminence called <HI>Flodden,</HI> lays on the opposite side of the river <HI>Till;</HI> it is the last and lowest of those hills that extend on the north-east of the great mountain of Cheviot, towards the low grounds on the side of the Tweed; from which river, Flodden is distant about four miles: The ascent to the top of it, from the side of the river Till, where it takes a northerly direction, just by the foot of the declivity on which the castle and village of Ford stands, is about half a mile; and over the Till, at that place, there is a bridge. On the south of <HI>Flodden,</HI> lays the extensive and very level plain of <HI>Mil∣field;</HI> having on its west side high hills, the branches of Cheviot; on the north, Flodden and other moderate eminences adjoining to it; on the south and east, a tract of rising grounds, nigh the foot of which is the slow and winding course of the <HI>Till.</HI> The nearest approach for the English army to <HI>Flodden,</HI> was through this plain, in every part whereof they would have been in full view of the Scots; where they had a great advantage in possessing an eminence, which on the side towards the English had a long declivity, with hollow and marshy grounds at its foot; while its crown contained such an extent of almost level ground, as would have sufficed for drawing up in good order the forces that
<PB N="13" REF="15"/>
occupied it. <HI>Surry</HI> encamped on <HI>Wooler Haugh,</HI> on the 7th of Septem∣ber, 1513, sent a Herald with a challenge, to join battle in the plain the next day, between the hours of twelve and three. This challenge was dated the 7th of September, 5 o'clock in the afternoon, as appears by Stowe, p. 493. The names of the subscribers were, <HI>Surry</HI> and his <HI>Son, Thomas Dacre, Clifford, Henry Scrope, Ralph Scrope, Richard Latimer, William Conyers, John Lumley, R. Ogle, William Percy, Edward Stanley, William Molineux, Marmaduke Constable, William Gascoyne, William Griffith, George Darcy, William Bulmer, Thomas Strangeways,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>James</HI> did not accept the challenge, but lay in his intrenchments, whilst <HI>Surry</HI> ad∣vanced his army near to <HI>Barmoor Wood,</HI> about two miles distant from the Scotch army, and lay there all night. A little hill on the east of <HI>Ford,</HI> covered the English army from the observation of their enemies; whilst, from this eminence, the Lord Admiral obtained a distinct view of all the Scottish army, and of all the eminences near it. The next morning the English made some marches to amuse the enemy, and then gained the ground which cut off <HI>James</HI>'s retreat to Scotland. By this position of his forces, <HI>Surry</HI> had an access opened to the Scottish camp, much less difficult and dangerous than on the other side of <HI>Flod∣den.</HI> The batteries raised by the Scotch to command the Bridge of of <HI>Ford,</HI> of which the vestiges still remain, were now rendered of no use. The Scots, deluded either by the treacherous advice of one <HI>Giles Musgrave,</HI> who engaged the King's confidence, and abused the royal ear, or depending that <HI>Surry,</HI> by his mode of marching the army, in∣tended to gain <HI>Berwick,</HI> and avoid a battle, appeared now to be con∣founded by the manoeuvres of the English, which bespoke their deter∣mination to come to an engagement; in order to receive them with the greater advantage, and to gain the ground they supposed the English would attempt to possess, on the western side of the hill, the Scots set fire to their huts on the eastern side, and made a motion to the west. The smoke being driven between the armies, concealed the progress the English were making, till they had almost gained the foot of the hill. <HI>Surry</HI> observed the confusion his approach had occasioned among the Scotch troops, and finding the ascent of the hill short and mode∣rately steep, determined not to delay the onset.</P>
<P>The English were disposed in three divisions; the van under <HI>Thomas Howard,</HI> the General's eldest son, Lord Admiral of England, the right wing being led by <HI>Sir Edmund Howard,</HI> brother to <HI>Lord Thomas,</HI> and Knight Marshal of the army. The middle division, or main battle, was
<PB N="14" REF="16"/>
led by the <HI>Earl of Surry</HI> in person, and the rear by <HI>Sir Edward Stanley.</HI> The <HI>Lord Dacres</HI> commanded a body of reserve, consisting of horsemen. The ordnance was placed in the front of the battle, and in the openings of the several divisions. After they had passed the little brook of <HI>Sandy∣ford,</HI> the Lord Admiral perceiving the Scots approaching towards him, drawn up in four great bodies, armed with long spears, like Moorish pikes, sent to his father the Agnus Dei that hung at his breast, as a token, accompanying a request, that as the van of the army was not sufficiently strong or extensive to receive the brunt of the whole Scottish army, his father would bring up the forces of his division, and range them in a line with the van. The English General, convinced of the expediency of this disposition, immediately came forward with his forces, and drew them up to the left of those of his son. The mode in which the Scots advanced to battle is variously described: Paulus Jovius says, they were formed in five square bodies, so that the third of those in which the royal standard was erected, and all the chief men fought, was inclosed on each side by a double line, forming, as it were, two wings. Comparing the several accounts, it seems most probable that the battalia was thus arranged: The van of the Scotch army led on the right by <HI>Alexander Gordon Earl of Huntley,</HI> and on the left by the <HI>Earls of Crawford and Montrose,</HI> and some say <HI>Lord Hume:</HI> the <HI>King</HI> was in the center or main body: a third division was commanded by the <HI>Earls of Lenox and Argyle</HI> with whom were <HI>Mackenzie, Maclean, and the Highlanders. Adam Hepburn Earl of Bothwell,</HI> with his kindred and clan, and the men of Lothian formed a body of reserve. They had with them a large train of artillery. The English artillery began to play, which made a dreadful carnage, whilst the Scotch cannon, from their high situation, took little or no effect, the shot going over the heads of the English. This obliged the Scotch to advance, the <HI>Earls of Lenox and Argyle,</HI> to∣gether with <HI>Lord Hume,</HI> moving with a body of ten thousand spearmen, supported by some horse, down the hill towards <HI>Branxion,</HI> made a fierce attack on the wing commanded by <HI>Sir Edmund Howard.</HI> The shock was violent, the Scots prevailed, and <HI>Sir Edmund</HI> was reduced to the last extremity, himself beaten to the ground the third time, and in im∣minent peril of Death, when <HI>Lord Dacres, and Heron the Bastard,</HI> who had joined the English army with a troop of fierce outlaws, his fol∣lowers, came in time to his rescue. <HI>Sir Edmund,</HI> thus relieved, imme∣diately joined the body commanded by his brother <HI>Lord Thomas,</HI> and they advancing against the <HI>Earls of Crawford and Montrose,</HI> whose troops were armed with spears, put them to the rout, and both the Earls were
<PB N="15" REF="17"/>
slain. On the other side of the field, <HI>Sir William Stanley,</HI> with the forces from Lancashire and Cheshire, being bowmen, forced the Scots to break their array, and descend to closer fight, in more even ground, where they were soon thrown into confusion, and put to flight, after leaving the <HI>Earls of Argyle and Lenox</HI> with the slain. The English attributed this success to the archers, but the Scotch writers alledge, the miscarriage of this part of their army was owing to the undisciplined ferocity of the Highlanders, who, animated by the success of the attack made on that wing of the English army commanded by <HI>Sir Edmund Howard,</HI> could not be restrained from rushing impetuously forward, in an irre∣gular and open manner, notwithstanding the signals, cries, and menaces of the French Ambassador <HI>La Motte,</HI> who perceived the consequence of such an improper and loose attack. <HI>The King</HI> of Scotland, whose bra∣very kindled to extravagance of courage at the perils which now seem∣ed to surround him, deaf to every advice and remonstrance, pressed forward, and exposed his royal person to all the dangers of the field: being sustained by <HI>Bothwell</HI> and his band, he charged on foot, at the head of the best of his troops, whose armour resisted the arrows of the English archery; he pressed forward to the standards of the <HI>Earl of Surry,</HI> and with such ardour and valour, that they were nearly gained by this heroic phalanx: but at length the wings of the Scotch army being totally routed, all the English forces were employed against this valiant band, who were surrounded by the coming in of <HI>Lord Dacre</HI>'s horse in the rear.</P>
<P>A considerable body of Borderers, commanded by <HI>Lord Hume,</HI> stood aloof during the most arduous part of the battle; and when he was required by <HI>Huntley,</HI> to attempt the King's deliverance from the circle of his enemies, he answered, <Q>that the man did well that day that stood and saved himself.</Q> Before the battle the <HI>old Earl of Angus,</HI> anxious to dissuade the King from engaging, was told by his Sovereign, <HI>that if he was afraid he might go home.</HI> The Earl judging it repugnant to his honour, to fight under the standard of a Prince from whom he had received so great an affront, requested he might be dismissed the ser∣vice; but as pledges of his loyalty and firm attachment to <HI>James,</HI> left as hostages of his honour, a large body of kindred and dependents, with his two sons, who both fell in the battle.</P>
<P><HI>This memorable battle</HI> began at four o'clock in the afternoon, and continued till it was dark. <HI>King James</HI> IV. was slain, with his natural
<PB N="16" REF="18"/>
son, <HI>the Bishop of St Andrews,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>In the ingenious notes by the Rev. Mr Lamb of Norham, to the ancient poem on Flodden Field Fight, we have the following concise account of Howard Earl of Surry. "Thomas Howard Earl of Surry was knighted for his remarkable courage at the battle of Barnet; he was made Knight of the Garter 1 King Richard III. He was taken prisoner at the battle of Bosworth, and committed to the Tower by King Henry VII. and attainted by Parliament. King Henry asked him how he durst bear arms in behalf of that tyrant Richard? To which he answered, <Q>He was my crowned King, and if the parliamentary authority of England set the crown upon a stock, I will fight for that stock; and as I fought then for him, I will fight for you, when you are established by the said authority.</Q> In the rebellion against the King by the Earl of Lincoln, the Lieutenant of the Tower offered him the keys of the Tower, in order to set himself at liberty; but he replied, <Q>that he would not be delivered by any power, but by that which had committed him.</Q> After he had been in prison three years and a half, the King gave him his liberty; and knowing his worth and nice sense of honour, took him into favour, and delivered up to him all his estates. The Earl took all occasions of relieving the oppressed subjects, and was accounted one of the ablest and greatest men in the kingdom. The Scots made an irruption into England, and besieged Norham Castle: the Earl raised the siege, took the castle of Ayton, and made all the country round a desert. James IV. of Scot∣land, incensed at this, sent a Herald with a challenge to him; to which he made a sensible and spirited answer, <Q>that his life belonged to the King, whilst he had the command of his army; but when that was ended he would fight the King on horseback or on foot; adding, that if he took the King prisoner in the combat, he would release him without any ransom; and that if the King should vanquish him, he would then pay such a sum for his liberty, as was competent for the degree of an Earl.</Q> In the year 1501 the Earl was Lord High Treasurer. In June, 1502, Margaret the King's daughter, a beautiful Princess, at the age of 14 years, was attended by the Earl of Surry, with a great company of Lords, Ladies, Knights, and Esquires, to the town of Berwick: she was conveyed to St Lambert's church in Lamyr Moor, where King James, attended by the chief Nobility, received her, and carried her to Edinburgh. The next day after her arrival there, she was with great solemnity married unto him, in the presence of all his Nobles. The King gave great entertainments to the English, whom the Scotch Noblemen and Ladies far outshone, both in costly apparel, rich jewels, massive chains, habiliments set with goldsmith's work garnished with pearl, and stones of price, and in gallant and well-trapped horses. They made also great feasts for the English Lords and Ladies, and shewed them justling and other pleasant pastimes, as good as could be devised after the manner of Scotland. Divers Ladies of Queen Margaret's train remained in Scotland, and were after∣wards well married to Noblemen. In 1507, two years before the death of King Henry VII. the Earl was Ambassador to the King of France; 2 King Henry VIII. he was made Earl Mar∣shal for life; in 1511 he was one of the Commissioners at the Court of Arragon. When King Henry VIII. heard that the Scots were preparing to invade England, he said, <Q>that he had left a Nobleman who would defend his subjects from insults.</Q> After the battle of Flodden, the Earl himself presented King James's armour to the Queen Regent. When the King re∣turned from France, he gave the Earl an augmentation of his arms, viz. to bear on the bend the upper part of a red lion depicted in the same manner as the arms of Scotland, pierced thro' the month with an arrow. In 1514 the Earl was created Duke of Norfolk, and a grant was given him in special tail of several manors. He hated and opposed Cardinal Wolsey, because he advised the King to pursue measures hurtful to the liberties of the people: finding that his opposition prevailed nothing, he resigned his post, and retired from Court. He died in the year 1524.</P>

<P>William Bishop of St. Andrews was a most accomplished youth, handsome, tall, and genteel, endued with excellent parts, great sweetness of temper, virtue, prudence, and liberality; he was skilled in the civil Law, Latin, Greek, and Music. The elegant pen of Erasmus, who was one of his Preceptors at Siena, in Italy, has set his incomparable character in a most ami∣able 
<PB N="18" REF="20"/>light. By a dispensation from the Pope, the King created him Archbishop of St. Andrews, 1509, and made him his Chancellor, 1511: he was also made the Pope's Legate at Latere.</P>
<P>It was not unusual, in ancient times, for the Dignitaries of the Church to attend their King in the wars; they were bound to do it by the feudal law. They held the temporalities of their benefices of the King as Barons, by the tenure of military service. It appears from many grants to the Clergy, that according to the establishment of the church of Scotland, the clerical and military character were not inconsistent. King Edward III. 1368, ordered all the Clergy to take up arms.</P>

When the Scotch King was perceived to be in imminent danger, those near his person formed themselves in circular order, and all fell by the sword, except <HI>Sir William Scott</HI> his Chancellor, and <HI>Sir John Foreman,</HI>

who were taken prisoners. The royal body was not discovered till the next day, when, in a circle of his slain Nobility, he was found by <HI>Lord Dacres,</HI> who was well acquainted with his person. After the royal re∣mains were removed to Berwick, Sir William Scott, Chancellor of Scot∣land, and Sir John Foreman, prisoners there, acknowledged the body of their late Sovereign. He was wounded in many parts, pierced also by several arrows; his left hand was almost severed from the arm by two several wounds, and his neck was laid open to the middle. How un∣fortunate was this race of Kings! James I. was murdered by the Earl of Athol, his uncle, in his palace. James II. died by the bursting of a piece of his own ordnance. James III. was slain by rebels, headed by his own son, James IV. whose miserable death is above described. His body was embalmed at Berwick, and from thence conveyed to the monastery of <HI>Sheene,</HI> where, at the dissolution, according to Stowe, it remained uninterr'd, and then thrown into a waste room among lumber.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>King James was killed in the 25th year of his reign, and the 39th of his age. He was of a majestic countenance, of a middle size, and a strong body. By the use of exercise, a slender diet, and much watching, he could easily bear the extremities of weather, fatigue, and scar∣city. He excelled in fencing, shooting, and riding. He delighted in fine horses, the breed of which he endeavoured to propagate in his own country, as it appears from several letters still extant, which he wrote to the Kings of Spain and Poland, entreating them that they would suffer his servants to buy such horses and mares as their respective dominions afforded. In re∣turn, he made them presents of hunting dogs, and of the famous little ambling horses called galloways, bred in the mountains and isles of Scotland. About the year 1508, the Lord of Campvere sent him many fine large Flanders horses; and also King Henry VII. several fine horses and rich furniture. He was of a quick wit, which by the negligence of those times was uncultivated with letters. He had great skill in the art of curing wounds, which was then common to the Scotch Nobles, always in arms. He was of a high spirit, of easy access, cour∣teous, and mild; just in his judicial decisions, merciful in his punishments, which he inflicted upon offenders always unwillingly. He was poor, from his profusion in sumptuous buildings, public shews, entertainments, and gifts.</P>
<P>As long as he lived he wore an iron chain girdle, to which he every year added one link, in testimony of his sorrow for having appeared at the head of the rebels who killed his father, contrary to his express orders. Bishop Lesley concludes his Life of James with telling us, that the Scotch nation lost in him, a King most warlike, just, and holy. Certain it is, that he was so dear to his subjects, that his death was more lamented than that of his predecessor ever was.</P>
<P>He married Margaret the eldest daughter of King Henry VII. by whom he left two sons, the eldest not two years old. About a year after King James's death, she married Archibald Douglas Earl of Angus, by whom she had a beautiful daughter, Margaret, born A. D. 1516, at Har∣bottle Castle, in Northumberland, afterwards the wife of Matthew Stewart Earl of Lenox, and by him mother to Henry Lord Darnley, father to King James I.</P>

<HEAD>NORHAM,</HEAD>
<P>a pleasant village, in a low situation, on the banks of <HI>Tweed.</HI> This is a place of great antiquity, by Hoveden called <HI>Ubbanford,</HI> said to be built by Egfrid Bishop of Lindisfarn in the year 830, and gives the name of <HI>Norhamshire</HI> to a large tract of country, a member of the county of Durham.</P>
<P><HI>Durham</HI> is a <HI>county palatine;</HI> by some authors it is said, the power of the palatinate commenced soon after the Norman conquest; but as no royal grant is to be found in the public repositories of records, we may presume it is of greater antiquity. The manors of <HI>Norham</HI> and <HI>Holy Island,</HI> and also the manor of <HI>Bedlington,</HI> commonly called <HI>Bed∣lingtonshire,</HI> anciently have been, and still continue parcels of the body of the said county palatine, and the inhabitants resort to Durham for justice, in all matters of law and civil jurisdiction, as members of the palatinate. Anciently <HI>Norham, Island,</HI> and <HI>Bedlingtonshires</HI> had several courts and officers of justice within their respective limits, under the Commissions of the Bishop of Durham, who held <HI>Jura Regalia</HI> within his See, as Justices, Sheriffs, Escheators, Coroners, and other officers, equally with the chief body of the county palatine laying between Tyne and Teese, until by act of parliament, in the 27th year of the reign of King Henry VIII. many of these royal franchises and jurisdictions were resumed to the Crown.</P>
<P>The royal remains of <HI>Ceolwulf</HI> were removed from Lindisfarn and deposited at <HI>Norham.</HI> A part of the old church is standing, and by some modern repairs is made a decent place of worship. Towards the east of the present church, the foundations of some buildings have lately been opened, and therein discovered a stone with sculptures upon it, and part of an inscription, faithfully copied in the plate.</P>

He endowed the monastery with the towns of Braynshaw, Warkworth, and the church which he built there, and also four other villages, Wudecestre, Whittingham, Edlingham, and Eglingham, with their appendages. After a long life he was buried in that monastery, but the above-mentioned Bishop Egred took up his body, and deposited it in the church of <HI>Norham.</HI> His head was afterwards carried to the church at <HI>Durham.</HI>—The Monks of the cell of <HI>Norham,</HI> in the following age, called in the country to make their offerings at the shrine of their royal brother, who always per∣formed some mighty miracle on his feast-day,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P>In the northern counties these <HI>holy feasts</HI> are not yet abolished, and in the county of <HI>Dur∣ham</HI> many are yet celebrated: they were originally feasts of <HI>dedication,</HI> in commemoration of the consecration of the church, in imitation of <HI>Solomon</HI>'s great convocation at the consecrating the <HI>Temple of Jerusalem:</HI> the religious tenor is totally forgotten, and the Sabbath is made a day of every dissipation and vice which it is possible to conceive could crowd upon a villager's manners and rural life. The manner of holding these <HI>festivals</HI> in former times, was under tents or booths erected in the <HI>Church-yard,</HI> where all kinds of diversions were introduced. <HI>Inter∣ludes</HI> were there performed, being a species of theatrical performance consisting of a rehearsal of some passage in holy writ personated by actors: this kind of exhibition is spoken of by tra∣vellers who have visited <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> where the religious even presume to exhibit the crucifixion and ascension, with all their tremendous circumstances. On these celebrations in this country, great feasts were displayed, and vast abundance of meat and drink. From whence we adopted the custom is not ascertained, but it seems probable, and by some authors it is insisted upon, that we had it in very great antiquity, and derived it from the Easterns. All their <HI>Holydays</HI> were distinguished by great <HI>feasts;</HI> the celebrations we read of, were performed with all the pomp of <HI>procession,</HI> approaching the temple of the Gods with <HI>offerings</HI> in great magnificence and splendour; where the cattle were consecrated, and then delivered over to feast the multitude. <HI>The feast</HI> of the translation of <HI>St. Cuthbert's body</HI> is celebrated every year with great reverence, by the inhabitants of <HI>Norham,</HI> on the first Sunday and Monday after the 4th day of September, O.

<P><HI>St. Gregory</HI> in his letter to <HI>King Ethelbert</HI> in the year 601, had enjoined him to destroy the heathen idols, their temples, and high places, that their influence might be taken away from the people, and their memory effaced. But on reviewing the estate of the inhabitants, their superstitions, and settled and habitual customs, he thought it expedient not to pursue measures so violent and alarming at first; and therefore in a letter wrote to <HI>Mellitus,</HI> an Abbot, who was upon his voyage to <HI>Britain,</HI> he orders him upon his arrival to inform <HI>Augustine,</HI> that on more mature deliberation, he had resolved that the <HI>Pagan temples</HI> in Britain should not be pulled down, it being sufficient that the <HI>Idols</HI> were taken away: therefore <HI>the places of the heathen worship</HI> were to be purified with a libation of <HI>holy water, altars</HI> were to be erected therein, and <HI>relics</HI> placed under them; for if these <HI>temples</HI> were well built, it was fit the property of them should be altered, the worship of Devils abolished, and the solemnities changed to the service of the true God: that when the natives perceived those religious structures remained standing, they might keep to the place without retaining the error; and be less shocked upon their first en∣trance upon christianity, by frequenting the <HI>temples</HI> they had been used to esteem. And his injunctions were, that since it had been their <HI>custom</HI> to sacrifice oxen to the Devils they adored, this usage ought to be refined on, and altered to an innocent practice. He recommends, that on <HI>the anniversary of the Saints</HI> whose <HI>relics</HI> are lodged there, or upon the return of the day on which <HI>the church was consecrated,</HI> the people should erect booths about the churches lately rescued from idolatry, provide a <HI>feast,</HI> and keep <HI>a christian holiday:</HI> not sacrificing their cattle to evil spirits, but killing them for their own refreshment, and praising God for the blessing: and thus by allowing them sensual gratifications, they may relish christianity the better, and be raised by degrees to the more noble pleasures of the mind; for unpolished and ignorant peo∣ple are not to be withdrawn from their habits all at once. God when he discovered himself to the <HI>Israelites</HI> in <HI>Egypt,</HI> did not forbid them the customary rites of <HI>sacrificing,</HI> but purified the service to himself. Greg. Epist. Lib. 9.

The Scotch forces having refused to proceed on the incursion they had entered upon, Lent being come, retreated from the eastern part of the county of Durham, where they had committed dreadful depre∣dations,
<PB N="29" REF="32"/>
and in their passage home undertook the siege of this castle, which was at that time thinly garrisoned, having only nine Knights of their corps. A gallant defence was made for some time, but no suc∣cours arriving, the place was surrendered, and the troops permitted to retire to Durham. David proposed to the Bishop to resign his castle, if he would renounce his allegiance to Stephen, in favour of the Em∣press Maude, which the Bishop refusing, he caused the town and castle of Norham to be destroyed.—Lyt. Hen. II. John of Hexham, Cont. Sym. Dunelm. Rich. of Hexham, Border History.</P>
<P>The <HI>castle</HI> and fortifications were restored by <HI>Hugh Pudsey, Bishop of Durham,</HI> in the year 1174, at the instance of his kinsman King Ste∣phen: he then built the <HI>great tower,</HI> which remains to this day: but this Bishop in the succeeding reign purchased his peace with the King of England, after certain defections in favour of the Scotch, by deli∣vering up to him this <HI>castle.</HI> In 1176, we find the <HI>castle</HI> still in the hands of the Crown, <HI>William de Neville</HI> being Keeper or Governor, who was sworn upon the relics of Saints, that upon the event of the King's death, he would deliver it up to the Bishop, on receiving orders from Richard de Lucy, the Bishop of Winchester, or the Bishop of Ely; and if the Bishop should die, that the castle should be restored to St. Cuthbert's church at Durham, that the rights of that church might not be impaired. The castle of Berwick at the same time was governed by Geofrey de Neville, who was under the like oath in respect thereof.</P>
<P>In 1203, King John held a personal conference with William the Lion, King of Scotland, at this castle, touching the demand made by the Scotch King of the northern counties; but nothing was determined, and King John returned in great displeasure.</P>
<P>In the year 1209, King John came with a great army to Norham; the King of Scotland then assembling his troops at Roxburgh, a dread∣ful war seemed to be threatened, from King John's extravagant demands and vehement wrath against the Scotch; but by the intervention of the Nobility, the two Monarchs agreed to hold a conference for settling their disputes, at Newcastle; to which place the King of Scotland im∣mediately repaired, attended by his brother David and a large train of Nobles; but being taken suddenly ill, a truce was concluded on till his health was restored. The dispute remaining unsettled, each Monarch again prepared for war, but a second interposition of the Nobility occa∣sioned
<PB N="30" REF="33"/>
them to hold another conference at <HI>Norham,</HI> in the same year, when a treaty of peace was concluded between William King of Scot∣land and King John, in which John stipulated not to erect any fortress at Tweedmouth; William on the other hand depositing a large sum of money as restitution for the ravages he had committed on the English borders.</P>
<P>In the year 1211, the two Kings held another conference at <HI>the castle of Norham,</HI> at which Ermengard Queen of Scotland was present, and by her amiable conduct greatly promoted the treaty on which the So∣vereigns had met. Here the terms of the former peace were ratified, and several new articles agreed to.</P>
<P>In the year 1213, King John, in the utmost terror of an insurrection of his subjects and an invasion from France, in consequence of the pa∣pal interdict which had been pronounced, came again to <HI>Norham,</HI> earnest to secure the amity of Scotland. William the Scotch King then lay dangerously ill, and was not able to proceed further than Haddington on his engagement to meet the King of England. Highly chagrined at this disappointment, he returned southward, and it was not long before his sentence of deposition was pronounced, his kingdom given to the king of France, and a croisade published against his territories by the Emissaries of the See of Rome. Driven to dreadful dilemma's, John was at length obliged to make his peace with the Holy See; the interdict, which had continued six years, was revoked, and the lands of those who had adhered to the papal authority against their Sove∣reign, and had been pronounced forfeitures to the Crown, of which those of Eustace de Vesey were part, were restored. Soon after this event succeeded that glorious combination of the Barons, under which <HI>the great charter</HI> and <HI>charter of the forests</HI> were obtained from the re∣luctant hands of this miserable tyrant. <HI>To those patriots, whose names ought to be engraven on the hearts of every Briton, we owe every thing valuable upon earth, the liberty we possess, and our authentic right to the properties we enjoy.</HI> To men of the North, the memory of <HI>Eustace de Vesey, Richard de Percy, Robert de Ros, Peter de Bruis, Nicholas D'Es∣toutesille, William de Moubrai,</HI> and <HI>Oliver de Vaux,</HI> northern Barons in this combination, should be immortal.</P>
<P>By Hemingford, and under his authority by Knighton, it is alledged, that the violations and injuries the Barons had sustained, as well touch∣ing
<PB N="31" REF="34"/>
their liberties and properties as in their private and family con∣cerns, urged them to appear more readily in the promotion of this great work, the necessity for which had indeed long been experienced. The base tyrant was not content with public oppressions, but in his mean∣ness of vice, even descended to the violation of the wives and daughters of his Barons; to which purpose he practised the vilest artifices. He had by stratagem possessed himself of the signet of <HI>Eustace de Vesey,</HI> by means of which he attempted to delude his Lady, that he might vio∣late her chastity. Vesey by a happy discovery gained a knowledge of the King's intentions, and concerting measures with the Lady, had address enough to put a common prostitute into the arms of the tyrant, and preserve the honour of his family. Exulting in the success of his project, and amidst the fervour of a generous resentment, he reproached the King to his face with his baseness, reviled him for the possession of a strumpet, and defied his wrath.</P>
<P>But to return to the history of Norham.—William King of Scotland dying, was succeeded by his son Alexander II. a youth not more than 15 years of age. The Barons of Northumberland had recourse to him for protection, and thereupon paid their homage at <HI>Felton.</HI> This in∣censed King John so much, that he prepared for a northern expedition. In the Year 1215, King Alexander came before <HI>Norham</HI> with a mighty army, and after an investiture for 40 days, was obliged to raise the siege. This circumstance is thus mentioned in Leland's Collectanea, v. 1. p. 535. <Q>Alexander King of Scottes, sun to King William, did entre ynto England, and did much despite to King John; he assegid the castel of Mitteford and <HI>Norham,</HI> and toke homages.</Q></P>
<P>In 1258, King Henry III. had projected a scheme for surprizing Alexander III. King of Scotland, and rescuing him from the govern∣ment of those who had taken him from those ministers approved of by King Henry. The government of the castles of <HI>Norham</HI> and <HI>Wark</HI> was conferred on Robert de Neville, Lord of Raby, whose commission from King Henry was <Q>to provide himself with horse and arms, to march with the forces designed to rescue Alexander from the restraint in which his rebellious subjects held him</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dugdale's Peerage, vol. 1.</NOTE> But this project was ren∣dered abortive by the assembling of a great army of Scots in the forest
<PB N="32" REF="35"/>

<P>A convention was appointed to be held at <HI>Norham,</HI> on the 10th day of May 1290, previous to King Edward the First's entering upon a de∣cision of the claims made by the several competitors for succession to the Crown of Scotland, on the death of Margaret of Norway, the in∣fant heiress. The assembly that day is said to be held in the parish church of Norham, when were present the King, and many Nobles and Prelates of both nations. The King declared, that the purpose of his coming was in quality of Superior and direct Lord of Scotland, to maintain the tranquillity of that kingdom, and to do impartial justice to those who laid claim to the Crown, but previous thereto he demanded their recognition of such his pretended sovereignty; and it is alledged, that his claim was historically deduced with great skill and artifice by <HI>Anthony Beck,</HI> then Bishop of Durham: after which three weeks were given for the Scotch Nobles to deliberate on the demand. On the 2d day of June then next, eight competitors, with several of the Prelates, Nobles, and Community of Scotland appeared, and held their council on this important matter, <Q>Congregatis ex opposito castri de Norham, ex alia parte fluminis Tweedae in quadam arda viridi,</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rot Turri.</NOTE> when all the competitors made the required recognition, and absolute submission of their several claims and pretended right to the Scottish Crown, to his decision.</P>
<P>On the same day the competitors, together with the whole company, came to the King in the church of <HI>Norham,</HI> and several subsequent meetings were held there for settling preliminaries: and the second day of the succeeding August was appointed for hearing all claimants at Berwick.</P>
<P>After judgment was given at Berwick in favour of John Baliol, on the 20th of November 1292, he swore fealty to King Edward in the castle of <HI>Norham,</HI> in the presence of many Nobles of both nations; and a commission was thence issued for enthroning him at Scone.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="36"/>In the following reign, in the year 1318, it was besieged by the Scots, Sir Thomas Grey being then Governor,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>In Leland's Collectanea, we have the following curious particulars of this siege.</P>
<P><Q>The Scottes came yn to the Marches of England, and destroyed the castels of Werk and Herbotel, and overran much of Northumberland Marches.</Q></P>
<P>"At this tyme Thomas Gray and his friends defended Norham from the Scottes."</P>
<P><Q>It were a wonderful processe to declare what mischefes cam by hungre and asseges by the space of XI yeres in Northumberland; for the Scottes became so proude after they got Ber∣wick, that they nothing esteemed the Englishmen.</Q></P>
<P><Q>About this tyme there was a great feste made yn Lincolnshir, to which came many Gentle∣men and Ladies; and among them a Lady brought a heanlme for a man of were, with a very rich creste of gold, to William Marmion, Knight, with a letter of commandment of her Lady, that he should go into the daungerest place in England, and there to let the heanlme to be seene and knowne as famous. So he went to Norham; whither within 4 dayes of cumming, cam Philip Moubray, Guardian of Berwicke, having in his band 140 men of armes, the very flour of men of the Scottish Marches.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Thomas Gray, Capitayne of Norham, seying this, brought his garison afore the bariers of the castel, behynde whom cam William richly arrayed, as al glittering in gold, and wear∣ing the heanlme as his Lady's present.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Then sayd Thomas Gray to Marmion, "Sir Knight, ye be cum hither to fame your heanlme, mount upon your horse, and ryde like a valiant man, to yown even here at hand, and I forsake God, if I rescue not thy body deade or alyve, or I myself will dye for it."</Q></P>
<P><Q>Whereupon he took his cursore, and rode among the throng of enemyes; the which layd sore stripes on hym and pulled hym at the last oute of his sadel to the ground.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Then Thomas Gray with all the hole garrison lette pryk yn among the Scottes, and so wondid them and their horses, that they were overthrowen, and Marmion sore beten was horsid agayn, and with Gray persewid the Scottes in chase. There were taken 50 horses of price; and the women of Norham brought them to the foote men to follow the chase.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Sir Thomas Gray hymselfe killed one Cryne, a Fleming, an Admiral, and great robber on the se, and yn hy favor with Robert Bruse: the residew that escaped were chased to the Nunnes of Berwick.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Adam de Gordon, a Baron of Scotland, came with 160 men to dryve away the cattel pasturing by Norham, but the young men of the country thereaboute encountered with them, whom Thomas Gray seing to stand in jepardy, wente oute with only 60 men, and killed most parte of the Scottes and their horses.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The same Thomas was twise assiged yn the castel of Norham by the Scottes, one tyme by the space almost of an yere, the other 7 monithes: his enuemies made fortresses before the castel, one at Upsedlington, another yn the church of Norham. This castel was twise vi∣tailied by the Lord Percy and Neville, that he came with very noble men, and rich and great socorers of the Marches of England.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The utter ward of Norham Castel was ons taken in Thomas Gray's tyme, on the vigill of St. Catherine, but they kept yt by 3 days, for theyr purpose in myning fayllied them.</Q></P></NOTE> by whose brave de∣fence, and the timely aid of the Lords Percy and Nevil, it was pre∣served from the hands of the enemy. In order to carry on the siege, the Scots raised two forts against the castle; one at the church of Nor∣ham, and the other at Upsitlington. On a succeeding siege in 1322, the Scots became masters of this fortress, but held it not long, for King Edward retook it after an assault of ten days, he having brought before it a very powerful army.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="37"/>In 1326, on the night of King Edward the Third's coronation, the Scots made an assault on the castle: Robert Manners then Governor had received previous intimation of the intended attempt, and permit∣ting 16 of the assailants to scale the outward wall, put them to the sword.</P>
<P>In 1327, soon after their march from Weardale, in the county of Durham, the Scots laid siege to <HI>Norham,</HI> and took it by storm. Three Knights of great military fame in the Scotch army fell in the attack, William de Montalt or Montraud,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Robert Bruce King of Scotland had assegid the castel of Norham, wher Robert Maners was Capytane; which with his garrison issuid oute one day, and discomfited the Scottes, kill∣ing William Monhaud, a Baron of Scotland.—Lel. Coll. v. 1. p. 550.</NOTE> John de Clapham, and Mailis de Dobery. Another party made an unsuccessful attempt on the castle of Alnwick, near the same time. In 1355, a party of Scots under the command of Sir William Ramsay burnt and plundered the town of Norham and adjacent country.</P>
<P>In the 13th year of the reign of King Henry VII. the Scots led by King James in person besieged <HI>Norham Castle,</HI> which had been put into good repair by Fox, then Bishop of Durham, and was well garrisoned. The Bishop came in person to its succour, the besieged making a va∣liant defence. Many of the outworks were destroyed. Some authors assert the Scotch did not raise the siege till the Earl of Surry with an army of 20,000 men came to its support, and obliged the assailants to retire. In the 5th year of the reign of King Henry VIII. <HI>the castle</HI> was assaulted by the Scots, previous to the battle of <HI>Flodden Field,</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P>We have this mentioned in the poem of the battle of Flodden, part 2, fit. 3, line 147.</P>

<P><PB N="36" REF="39"/>The King, by the advice of this traitor, descended from <HI>Lady Kink-bank</HI> into the flat ground near the Tweed, now called the <HI>Gin Haugh,</HI> whence with his cannon he threw down the north east corner of the castle wall, a large fragment of which now lies by the side of the river. Bishop Tunital, in Queen Elizabeth's time, rebuilt the wall: this is now very distinguishable from the old work. There is a field near the castle, in which this traitor was hanged, now called Hangman's Land. This fact is not mentioned by the Historians. By the account of it in the poem, we shall more readily understand the following epigram of Sir Thomas More, Lord High Chancellor in the time of King Henry VIII.</P>

short state of their progress and proceedings in the Mers and Tiviot∣dale. The progress of the Berwick garrison was as far as Dunglass: the garrisons of Wark and Cornhill proceeded as far as the hills of Lammar Muir, and over the dry March of Tiviotdale. The chief Com∣manders were Sir George Bowes, Sir Brian Laiton, and Sir Ralph Eure. On the 17th of July, Bowes, Laiton, and others burnt Dunse, the chief town of the Mers; and John Carr's son, with the garrison of Cornhill Castle, entered Greenlaw, and carried off a booty of cattle, sheep, and horses. On the 19th of the same month, the men of Tyndale and Ridsdale, returning from a road into Tiviotdale, fought with the Laird of Ferniherst and his followers, and took him and his son John prisoners. On the 24th of July, the garrison of Wark, the Captain of Norham, and Henry Eure burnt Long Edmin, made many prisoners, and took a bastell-house strongly kept, and got a booty of 40 nolt and 30 horses, besides those on which their prisoners were mounted, each on a horse. On the 2d of August, the Captain of Norham burnt the town of Home, near to the castle gates, with the surrounding steads. Sept. 6th, Sir Ralph Eure burnt Eikford church and town, the barnekin of Ormeston, and won by assault the Moss Tower, burnt it, and slew 34 people within it: he likewise burnt several other places in that neigh∣bourhood, and carried off more than 500 nolt and 600 sheep, with 100
<PB N="37" REF="40"/>
horse load of spoils got in the tower. Sept. 27th, the men of the east and part of the middle March, won the church of Eccles by assault, and slew 80 men in the abbey and town, most part gentlemen of head sirnames; they also took 30 prisoners, and burnt the abbey and town. On the same day the garrison of Berwick brought out of the east end of the Mers 600 bolls of corn, and took prisoner Patrick Home, brother's son to the Laird of Aiton. November 5th, the men of the middle March burnt Lussedden, in which were 16 strong bastell houses, slew several of the owners, and burnt much corn. November 9th, Sir George Bowes and Sir Brian Laiton burnt Dryburgh, a market town, all ex∣cept the church, with much corn, and brought away 100 nolt, 60 nags, 100 sheep, and much other booty, spoilage, and insight gear.</P>
<P>The whole number of towns, towers, steads, barnekins, parish churches, and bastell houses seized, destroyed, and burnt, in all the border country, was 192, Scots slain 400, prisoners taken 816, nolt 10,386, sheep 12,492, nags and geldings 1296, gayts 200, bolls of corn 850, insight gear an indefinite quantity.</P>
<P>In Hertford's expedition, places burnt, rased, and cast down 129; among these Dunse, the abbey and town of Eccles, the tower and bar∣nekin of Nisbit, the towers of Dunse, Redbraes, Pollard, and Merting∣ton, with the castles of Wedderburn and Blackadder were rased. On the river Tweed, from Kelso upwards, 33 places were destroyed; among which were the abbey of Kelso, the abbey and town of Dryburgh, the abbey of Mailross, and the towers of Dawcove and Stotherick: on the river Tiviot 36; among which were the friars near Kelso, the towers of Roxburgh and Ormeston, and the two towers of Boon Jedburgh: 12 places on the Rowle Water: 13 on Jed; among which, the abbey, friars, and town of Jedburgh: 45 places on the Kayle, and between it and the Tweed: 19 on Bowbent (alias Bowmont). The sum total of the places destroyed or laid waste in the whole inroad was 287; of which, mo∣nasteries and friar houses 7, castle towers and piles 16, market towns 5, villages 243, mills 13, spitals and hospitals 3.</P>
<P>In the 22d year of the reign of King Henry VIII. <HI>Norham</HI> was sur∣prized by the Scotch, and soon after recovered by one Franklin, Arch∣deacon of Durham.</P>
<P>In the year 1551, a treaty was signed in the church of Norham: the Scotch Commissioners were Robert Bishop of Orkney, Robert Lord Max∣well,
<PB N="38" REF="41"/>
Thomas Master of Erskine, and Louis de St. Gelais, Lord of Lansac, Knt. those for England were Thomas Bishop of Norwich, Robert Bowes, Leonard Beckwith, and Thomas Chaloner, Knt.</P>
<P>In 1552, <HI>the castle of Norham,</HI> which from the time of Bishop Flam∣bert had appertained to the See of Durham, appears from Lord Whar∣ton's proposals for the better protection of the Marches, to be vested in the Crown. The deprivation of Cuthbert Tunstal happened on the 11th of October in this year, soon after the accession of Queen Mary, before which time we have no public record to shew how Norham might come into the power of the Crown. The infamous law for the dissolution of the bishopric, is the first act of any notoriety I have been able to discover which could effect the matter: and notwithstanding that law, it appears from several records that in the reign of Queen Mary the castle was repaired and again fortified by Bishop Tunstal; and that some very short time before his death, in the year 1559, he held a treaty there with the Scotch, when were present, Thomas Earl of Northumberland, William Lord Dacres of Gilsland, and Croft, Com∣mander of the fortress of Berwick, on the behalf of the English; and for Scotland, the Earls of Morton and Hume, with the Dean of Glasgow.</P>
<P>Camden describes <HI>Norham Castle</HI> in his time <Q>to be situate on the top of a high steep rock, and fortified with a trench: the outward wall, of great circuit, was guarded by several turrets in a canton towards the river, in which another wall much stronger encircled the keep or tower of great height.</Q> This description gives a perfect idea of its figure, after the repairs made by Bishop Tunstal. Towards the river the ruins now hang upon the very verge of the precipice, part of which, by the washing of the torrent, has given way, and carried with it the superstructure on that side; which with the decay incident to the length of time, has occasioned a wide breach in the outward wall spoken of by Camden: the turrets, as he is pleased to stile them, appear to be no other than demi-bastions, a mode of fortification peculiar to the age in which this erection arose; a perfect model of which, still in good preservation, appears at <HI>Hartlepool,</HI> in the county of Durham, of near the same date, being the palatinate port of the bishopric.</P>
<P>The wall of the castle of Norham, which extended from the water on the south side, was guarded with a gate-way and tower, having square turrets on each side, and thence ascending the steeps stretching
<PB N="39" REF="42"/>
eastward, was also defended by another gate-way of superior dimen∣sions, fortified by two heavy round flanking towers, the remains of which are still considerable. This appears to be the chief entrance, and fronts a plain of considerable extent: it was defended by a draw bridge over a very wide moat, which began here, and was extended round the land side of the castle, enclosing a spacious area or ballium, with a very strong wall garnished with demi-bastions at intervals. Within the area of this outward wall are the remains of a chapel and several other structures. To defend the keep or main tower, a very strong wall encloses a narrow area or interior ballium, which is entered by a gate∣way, guarded on each hand by square towers. The keep is a very large heavy square building, vaulted underneath, like most structures of this kind. Part of the vaults and some of the prisons remain entire, but all the interior parts of the tower above, are laid open and demo∣lished. The remains of an exploratory turret are seen on one corner of the keep: it may be presumed it was originally uniform, bearing a turret at each corner. The height of the great tower is about 70 feet, containing four stories or ranges of apartments. The whole build∣ing is constructed of red free-stone, of a soft nature, and subject to decay. There is not the least ornament about it, and the whole aspect is gloomy to the greatest degree: it wears the countenance of the times of King Stephen, without any embellishments of the age in which Bishop Tunstal lived.</P>
<P>This has been a very formidable fortress, inaccessible from the Tweed; and before the use of fire arms, from its present remains ap∣pears impregnable, if fully garrisoned, and duly provided with stores against a siege. When the outward walls were in repair, and filled with troops; when the oillets and other devices for the garrison's fighting and defence were properly supplied with experienced archers, and the bastions were kept by men of valour, it seems almost incredible that this place could ever be taken by assault. But when there was a re∣gular blockade, and time for mining and raising engines, the defence then consisting of different manoeuvres, would consequently harrass the most powerful garrison; frequent sallies becoming necessary, by which the troops are exposed to the superior numbers of besiegers: incessant watchings and severe duties wear down the greatest fortitude of soul, and scarcity of provision with perpetual anxiety subdue the most vigo∣rous heart. Such are the calamities of a siege, and such were many times experienced here: but of all the distresses the valiant know, none
<PB N="40" REF="43"/>
equals that which proceeds from a defection in his partizans, and the corruption of his colleagues. So prone is the human heart to evil, that we find in the history of every state and people, such horrid tales of treachery, that the stain upon the human character leaves so disagree∣able a sentiment upon the mind of the reader, as with its bitterness and gall almost overwhelms the pleasures we receive by the images of virtue.

<P><HI>The old castle,</HI> of which little remains but scattered fragments, and confused heaps of foundations, stood to the north-west of the present town: much of its strength seems to have consisted in the elevation and mount on which it was erected. The present heaps and lines of ruins merit no description; their extent and situation remain to point out the ancient strength of this important fortress, now moulder∣ing under the wrath of Time, and prostrate with the earth.</P>
<P>Monsieur Jorvin wrote a description of England and Scotland, pub∣lished at Paris, A. D. 1672, which the editor of the Antiquarian Reper∣tory thought worth inserting in that work: the account given of Ber∣wick, and the adjoining country, contains several particulars which claim a place here.</P>
<P><Q>Barrwick is the first town by which I re-entered England, and be∣ing a frontier to England, has been fortified in different manners: there is in it at present a large garrison, as in a place of importance to this kingdom. It is bounded by the river Tweed, which empties itself into the sea, and has a great reflux, capable of bringing up large vessels, was it not prevented by sands at the entrance into its port. I arrived here about ten of the clock on a Sunday; the gates
<PB N="42" REF="45"/>
were then shut during church time, but were opened at eleven, as is the custom in all fortified places. <HI>Here is an upper and a lower town,</HI> which are both on the side of a hill, that slopes towards the river. <HI>On its top there is a ruined and abandoned castle, although its situation makes it appear impregnable: it is environed on one side by the ditch of the town, on the other side by one of the same breadth, flanked by many round towers and thick walls, which enclose a large palace, in the middle of which rises a lofty keep or donjon, capable of a long resistance, and com∣manding all the environs of the town.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>The high town encloses within its walls and ditches those of the lower, from which it is only separated by a ditch filled with water. In the upper town the streets are straight and handsome, but there are not many rich inhabitants, they rather preferring the lower town, in which there are <HI>many great palaces,</HI> similar to that which has been built near the great church, and <HI>in all the open areas are great fountains,</HI> and in one of them, the guard house and public parade, before the town hall or sessions house, over which is the clock tower of the town; so that by walking over Barwick, I discovered it to be <HI>one of the greatest and most beautiful towns in England.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>The greatest part of the streets in the lower town, are either up or down hill, but they are filled with many rich Merchants, on account of the convenience and vicinity of its port, bordered by a large quay, along which the ships are ranged. There is not a stone bridge in all England, longer or better built than that of Barwick, which has 16 large and wonderfully well wrought arches; <HI>it is considered as one of the most remarkable curiosities of the kingdom.</HI> I passed over it in leaving the place, adjoining to it is a large suburb, <HI>from whence the country is covered with heath and briars to Ashton,</HI> where there is a castle; Bowk∣lin, where the sea appears on the left, and a small island not far off, which forms a pretty good harbour, near a village, having a castle. All this sea coast is covered with sand banks, <HI>and the interior country to Belford an entire desert, as it is far above</HI> 20 <HI>miles round about;</HI> being only fitted for feeding cattle, occasioned by divers rivulets, which run through meadow, where great herds of all sorts of cattle may be seen feeding.</Q></P>
<P><HI>The town of Berwick</HI> lays on the inclination of an easy slope, towards the river; most of the buildings are ancient, and make but a mean ap∣pearance;
<PB N="43" REF="46"/>
the streets are narrow, except that only in which the town house is placed. The fortifications are modern, and said to be excel∣lent, being constructed agreeable to the modes adopted since the use of cannon. In the year 1560, these new works were begun, by which the ancient fortification was greatly reduced; for this purpose many houses were taken down, and a tower which stood in a street called <HI>Hide hill:</HI> the ancient chief fortress or castle, which adjoined to the south-west corner of the old town wall, was left at the distance of se∣veral hundred yards from the modern works. Camden speaking of Ber∣wick, says it is "Munitissimum totius Brittaniae oppidum." The man∣ner of fortifying with bastions was a French device, begun in the time of Francis I. and Charles V. or at the soonest of Louis XII.—The Lord Grey of Wilton was the first that bore the title of Governor of Berwick in commission. There are excellent barracks for the garrison, the building plain and neat, consisting of a center and two wings. The public walk is on the rampier, where the gaity of the inhabitants is chiefly displayed, and to which the soldiery contribute greatly. The church is a neat plain structure, built in the time of Cromwell, and consequently without a steeple,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Colonel George Fenwick of Brinkburn, under parliament, superintended the work. He lays buried in the church, under the following epitaph:

<P>About three months before the death of Alexander, (the 2d, King of Scotland) a meeting was held on the Marches of England and Scotland, for ascertaining the laws of those Marches, and enforcing their observation. This work was committed to 12 Knights <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The names of the English Knights were Robert de Clifford, Robert son of Ralph Robert Mallfant, Robert de Ulfeston, William de Burnville, William de Siremeston.

<P N="1">I. The first article is, that any subject of Scotland accused of committing in England, homi∣cide or any other crime<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In MS. robbery, theft, homicide or any other crime.</NOTE> that ought to be tried by single combat, shall not be obliged to an∣swer in any other place but on the Marches of the two kingdoms; and in this article, the places for the trial of those crimes are fixed <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">If the defendant dwelt above Redam, he was to answer at Riding Burn, but Radsdale and Cookdale were to answer at Campespeth, agreeably to the laws and customs used between the kingdoms.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="2">II In the next place it was declared that all who dwelt between Totness in England, and Caithness in Scotland, might agreeably to the customs of both kingdoms, be justly called the Marches to decide their quarrels by combat; excepting the persons of the Kings themselves, and of the Bishops of St. Andrews' and Dunkeld.</P>
<P N="3">III. It was further unanimously declared, that if any vassal or bondsman in Scotland, should with or without his goods, fly into England with the intention of escaping from his Lord; and if within 42 days after, he should be pursued by his Lord's Bailiff, the fugitive should be brought back to Scotland on the oath of the pursuer without any opposition from the English; the same being understood to hold with regard to fugitives from England. But if the fugitive was not pursued before 42 days were elapsed, his Lord could not recover him without a brief from the sovereign of the kingdom where he remained: and on his being dis∣covered there <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In Reg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> ex quo exiverit <HI>(in printed copy) in MS.</HI> regno inquo extiterit.</NOTE> after the expiration of 42 days <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">An exception is made, <HI>nisi fuera nativus</HI> (not translated) does it mean that these oaths were unnecessary where the fugitive was a bondsman?</NOTE>, his Lord might seize him upon giving his own oath, accompanied by the oath of six others.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="45" REF="48"/>IV. Moreover it was found, that if any of the rank of a bondsman <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Si Nativus aliquis.</HI> Nativus is here rendered according to its usual signification in the laws and deeds of that time; but <HI>native</HI> seems to be the juster term.</NOTE> of the one kingdom had delivered pledges for a debt he owed in the other, he might <HI>recover these pledges</HI> within thrice 15 days <HI>upon finding sureties for payment, one out of each kingdom</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Namos suos replegiabit per Inbrocht wood et utbrotcht wood <HI>MS.</HI> Wred) Wred <HI>is a surety.</HI> Inbrotcht et utbrotcht na∣tivos et extraneos. <HI>Not in Nicholson.</HI></NOTE>; and pay the sum itself within 15 days immediately following. But if the sum was not then paid, the creditor might seize the pledge of his debtor, and detain it until he received full satisfaction for the debt owing him. But if the debtor denied his debt, he was obliged to purge himself of it on the Marches within the first succeeding 15 days by the oaths of seven <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Cum septima manu. This interpretation is given upon a presumption that the meaning is the same here, with what is more fully expressed in the conclusion of the former article by these words, <HI>per Jurameatum sex Virorum et se septimo, et per sacramentum sex Virorum, et se septimo.</HI> In Art. VIII.</NOTE>, his own included. And this was also to be understood of the surety when the creditor could not be found, but if he con∣fessed his debt and had no goods wherewith to pay it, he was obliged to declare himself not possessed of goods exceeding the value of five shillings and four-pence; and must further swear, that he will pay the said debt, as he may be able to acquire or gain the means of paying it; re∣serving only his own sustenance.</P>
<P N="5">V. In the next place they found that all climants on either side, should in person give their oaths in support of their claims with the exception only of the two Kings and their Heirs, and the Bishops of St. Andrews' and Dunkeld. The person who ought to swear in the place of the King of England, was his standard bearer and the constable of his army, on the other hand, the Priest of <HI>Wredale</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Wredale (<HI>Vallis Doloris,</HI> Ford.) is the same with Stow (so Mill is the description of <HI>Mellrose.</HI></NOTE>, was to swear for the King of Scotland and the Bishop of St. Andrews', and the Prior of the Isle for the Bishop of Dunkeld <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Prior de Insala,</HI> probably of <HI>Lockleven,</HI> where the Convent was governed by a <HI>Prior.</HI> The head of the Convent at <HI>Inchcalm</HI> was an <HI>Abbot.</HI> Spotswood 236, 237.

<P N="6">VI. It was further declared, that no person beside these had a right to depute <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Facere Attornatum.</NOTE> another, to swear for him in any quarrel touching life or limb, unless such deputation was made with consent of both parties; but without this consent the failure of either in appearing in person to give his oath lost him his cause for ever.</P>
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ita pro uno solo Defectu.</NOTE>
<P N="7">VII. They next found that if there were any plea on the Marches between a plaintiff and a defendant, that affected life or limbs, and if the defendant happened to die within the 15 days preceding the day of trial, his body should be carried to the Marches at the time, and to the place appointed between the parties; because <HI>no man can be essoigned by death.</HI> Again, when the appellant delayed his appearance beyond the appointed day, the defendant <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The word <HI>defendant</HI> is not in the original; but the sense seems necessarily to require its being understood.</NOTE> ought to pass to the Marches and obtain an attestation <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Accipere Manum de Wardshiel;</HI> (Wardshiel (MS.

<P N="8">VIII. It was also found that if any Scottish robber stole in England an horse, oxen, or cows, or any other thing, and carried the goods stolen into Scotland, the person whose pro∣perty they were, wherever he discovered them, might in the Court <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">From this it is probable there were not at that time any Warden Courts.</NOTE> of the Lords in whose

<P N="9">IX. The next article fixed was, that in any trial on the Marches that affected life or limb, as for robbery, theft, or murder, where the defendant was convicted by the issue of a com∣bat, his sureties ought not to be answerable for a greater sum than the plaintiff mentioned in his charge. But <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">From this to the end of the article, from the MS. in the Advocates Library.</NOTE> if a person accused, was convicted of slaying a man, and his sureties were dead, he was obliged to make good the forfeiture <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Resp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>debit die de monteple<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI> The learned Sir James Foulis of Collington, gave the Editor the following proba∣ble meaning of the word <HI>montoplen.</HI> I take <HI>mont<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>plen</HI> to be a contraction for <HI>manto plenitudine,</HI> a barbarous law term to express the full time of waiting.

But <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Debout se purgare tanquam exeuntes de Carcere quibus Plegius defuerit.</NOTE> all such persons ought to purge themselves in the same manner as those who having no sureties, are suffered to go out of prison.</P>
<P N="10">X. It was next declared, that if a malefactor passing from one district or province of the kingdom, into which he had entered into another, desired to obtain protection <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Hebere voluerit Pacem.</HI> The article is, <HI>si aliquis malefactor existens in una Regione in altera Parte</HI> (MS. alteram Partem) <HI>regei in quo intravit habere volueris Pacem,</HI> &amp;c. perhaps it may be understood of a malefactor passing over the March that divides the counties from one kingdom to the other; and the sense according to this interpretation seems better. Probably the text is corrupt.</NOTE> he should re∣ceive it from those having power to grant it, viz. from the Sheriff of the county into which he had entered; and if he could not find the Sheriff, he might obtain peace at the first church, by ringing the bells, and should remain in peace there until protection was granted by the Sheriff; but if before thus obtaining his peace, he was attacked, he might be brought back without any opposition.</P>
<P N="11">XI. It was further agreed, that if any inhabitant of either kingdom affirmed in opposition to a claimant of the other, that a horse, ox, cow, or hog, in his possession, was his own, he should have the usual respite of days established between the kingdoms <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Habebit Di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e omnes inter regna Statutes ut ultimas Dies Litis.</NOTE>, before the matter was brought to a trial. And on the day fixed for that, if he chose to avoid a combat, and knew that the thing was not his own, he was obliged to bring it to the Marches, and inform the op∣posite party that he was satisfied upon enquiry, that the horse, &amp;c. was the property of that party, and after this declaration he was bound to drive it into the water of Tweed or Esk; and the defendant should then be free from the claim or challenge brought against him. But if it was drowned before it reached the mid stream of the water <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">So rendered in MS. translation mentioned by Dr Nicholson.</NOTE>, the defendant ought accord∣ing to the custom of the Marches to be still answerable for it; and this extended to an ox, cow, or swine, or other things, only nothing was established about a load <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">De Sar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="12">XII.

The clergy suppli∣cated the Legate to admonish, or, if admonitions could not prevail, to employ his Legative authority, to compel the Kings not to suffer so detestable an abuse to be extended to ecclesiastical persons.</NOTE>, whence many combats must needs ensue, from the strifes that arose from time to time on the Marches.</P>
<P N="13">XIII. They further agreed, that any person in their kingdom pursuing for the recovery of a debt due to him in the other, ought, according to the laws of the Marches, if the person in∣debted to him were a Clerk to seek justice <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Clericos inde monere <HI>(MS. manare.)</HI></NOTE> from the Clerks, if a Knight from the Knights, and if a Burgess from the Burgesses; by which classes alone judgment <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Et de illis et non aliis judicari</HI> (MS. sic de aliis et non alios judicari.)</NOTE> is respectively to be given, where their brethren are concerned.</P>
<P>Finally they agreed, that the magistrates within and without Burghs <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In Burgh et Out Burgh Potestatem habebunt <HI>(MS. in Burgh et in Suth Burgh.)</HI></NOTE>, should have power to distrain the inhabitants of each kingdom, in order to inforce the observation of the aforesaid customs between the kingdoms.</P>

<P>According to Hector Boethius, Berwick existed as a place of strength in the days of <HI>Osbert</HI> the Northumbrian King. It is reasonable to con∣jecture, when <HI>Tweed</HI> became the boundary between Scotland and Eng∣land, that Berwick would arise as a barrier town, be fortified, and have an armed garrison. In the account given of the Danish invasion under <HI>Hubba,</HI> about the year 867, Berwick is mentioned as the landing place of the invaders. Whilst the Saxons possessed the country north of Tweed, Berwick was not likely to have risen to any great impor∣tance, being so near the royal seat of <HI>Bamburgh,</HI> except it should have had a fortress, as a safeguard to the episcopal seat of <HI>Lindisfarn.</HI></P>
<P>The same author relates, that <HI>King Donald</HI> having defeated the army of <HI>Osbert</HI> near the river Jedd, marched down the Tweed to Berwick, which the Saxons then had in possession, and which they abandoned on the news of their Sovereign's overthrow: Donald seized three Saxon vessels in the Bay, with great riches on board; upon which event he and his followers gave themselves up to riot and revelling: of this the

Saxons took advantage, and made an unexpected assault on the town in the night, when many of the Scots were slain, and their King was taken prisoner.

<P><HI>Opinions</HI> concerning the aboriginal form of <HI>human habitations</HI> in general, and <HI>British</HI> in particular, founded upon the word BURROUGHS, by <HI>the Rev. Mr Conyers Place</HI> of Dorchester.</P>
<P>Burrough and its contraction <HI>Burgh</HI> (of which also I take <HI>Burrow, Barrow,</HI> and <HI>Bury</HI> to be so many corruptions) is an allowed note of the antiquity of the place so called, as well by <HI>Cambden</HI> himself as those who are the authors of the annotations upon him; nor can there be a more effectual confirmation of that note, than that those <HI>old</HI> and <HI>mother towns</HI> that have the privilege of sending members to parliament, are particularly distinguished by that name, and are called <HI>Burroughs,</HI> or allowed to be so; the whole title of many of them to their present enjoyment of that right in the state of decay they are now reduced to, seems to rest in their claim to that title, and in the respect and veneration which the evidences of antiquity inserted in that name bespeaks for them.</P>
<P>I cannot perceive that the name <HI>Burrough</HI> or <HI>Burgh,</HI> was instituted to denote any kind of eminence in the place so called, beyond others, so as to mean a <HI>Fort</HI> or <HI>Castle,</HI> or place any way fortified with ramparts, or otherwise distinguished by any peculiar advantages, as is often suggested by <HI>Camden;</HI> or that the name puts the place called by it under any distinction what∣ever, unless accidentally, besides that of common habitation, the bare antiquity of which it only implys, because it is often confounded with such appellatives to ascertain and distinguish it, as <HI>Burgh Castle, Burgh Fort,</HI> &amp;c. and that it signifies no more than <HI>house, houses, or a town,</HI> a settlement where one or more families dwelt. <HI>Burrough</HI> was the <HI>habitation,</HI> and <HI>Bour</HI> was the <HI>inhabitant,</HI> hence <HI>neighbour</HI> i. e. a <HI>nigh-bour</HI> or one that lived in a <HI>Burrough</HI> not far off.</P>
<P>But the name <HI>Burrough,</HI> though at first it directly meant only one common habitation, yet carries in it monumental evidences of the original form of such habitation, and indirectly lets us into that: for our application of the name <HI>Burrough,</HI> to the habitation of such animals whose natures are incapable of making improvements in their manner of dwelling that is still retained among us, discovers the native and simple signification of the name <HI>Burrough,</HI> when our ancestors gave their own dwellings that name; for we appropriate it only to the under∣ground lodgings of animals, as to the holes of <HI>foxes, badgers,</HI> and <HI>rabbits.</HI> From whence I infer that when it was first applied to human habitation, whether in an allusive sense from them, or their's from it; or whether both were simple and equally original, that it signified the very same, or what nearly resembled the habitations of those creatures, and consequently that the inhabitants of this land, when the name was given, dwelt chiefly underground, and lived not in houses raised from the ground, but in holes dug in it, which sense of the word seems still to obtain as to the dead, though it has lost its native idea as to the living; for hence we may call putting a corpse into a hole underground to <HI>bury</HI> or <HI>burrough it:</HI> a <HI>barrow</HI> or <HI>burrough</HI> being a place dug for that purpose, though the custom of monumental tumulation has abused the word to express the contrary to what it was instituted to express, and to signify a <HI>hill</HI> instead of a <HI>hole.</HI></P>
<P>Our original <HI>Burroughs</HI> in the primitive simplicity were but as so many human warrens, con∣sisting of a set of underground caverns; the lodging part and body at least of each dwelling run in, and was underground; and this is but suitable to the savage way of life of the old
<PB N="49" REF="52"/>Britons in other respects; such as their going naked, which alone cuts off all the ends almost of raising houses: for to what end should men raise houses, who had neither cloaths nor fur∣niture, nor wanted any guard against the inclemency of the air, nor had any intent of re∣tirement to answer, but security from wild beasts, or noise whilst they slept? Their painted or rather smoke-bound hides, looked as if they lived in rooms where smoke had no vent by win∣dows or chimneys; to which we may add, as an inducement to natural simplicity, that under∣ground lodgings were both cooler in summer (if our clime is ever too hot) and warmer in win∣ter; for which latter reason 'tis pretty near kept to in <HI>Iceland, Lapland,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Purchas</HI> says of the <HI>Icelanders,</HI> all their houses are under ground. Lib. 3. ca. 22.</P>
<P>Nor were the inhabitants of this island singular in this matter, so no derogation to them, be∣cause it seems to have been Nature's primitive mode of dwelling, common with them to most nations. The various notions of <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, of old, that took their names from the custom of living in <HI>holes</HI> or <HI>burroughs,</HI> strictly such, is an instance of it: hence it is that the <HI>old Giants</HI> are represented to us as under-ground livers all of them, as <HI>Polyphemus's Cave, Cacus's Den,</HI> &amp;c. The rustic Divinities of the heathen, such as <HI>Pan, Faunus, the Satyrs,</HI> &amp;c. are proposed to us as residing in under-ground seats, and your <HI>Sibylls, Trophonius,</HI> and the rest of them, made choice of caverns to vent their oracles from, as more awful and venerable by their resem∣blance of primitive and simple times, when <HI>heaven and earth</HI> corresponded together more fami∣liarly; and I am apt to think, that the notion of your <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> and <HI>Terrae Filii,</HI> men springing out of the earth, did arise hence; and that a great many suddenly bolting out at once from their <HI>burroughs,</HI> like the <HI>Tinners</HI> in Cornwall from their mines, might first give occasion to those fables and fancies, of crops of armed troops starting up from dragons and serpents teeth, to the great surprize of <HI>Cadmus and Jason. Ovid</HI> reckons men's building houses and living above ground as an improvement, or rather a degeneracy gradually introduced after the <HI>golden age,</HI> and in process of time

<P>After the <HI>deluge,</HI> the terror it had struck, and the fear of its return, made men keep chiefly to the mountains, as the safest: besides that, the plains and flat countries must be all so mixed, and thereby puddled, that a century would scarce harden and settle them again sufficiently for safe and convenient habitation; for till the waters had wrought themselves drains, after such a thorough blend, they must be drawn off very leisurely, and when the fertility of the plains invited them down, the distrust of the floods returning, first put them upon building upwards from the level; of which new project <HI>Babel</HI> seems to have been the first instance, followed by others built after the same new mode by <HI>Nimrod,</HI> in the plain of <HI>Shinar,</HI> nor does it appear that any such thing had been practised before by the antediluvians; and <HI>Moses</HI>'s way of men∣tioning that piece of architecture does intimate the project to have been entirely new, and that the tower or town of <HI>Babel</HI> was the first building that men had raised above ground for habita∣tion; for <HI>Cain</HI>'s building of a <HI>city</HI> may be accounted for by forming a society only, or surround∣ing the place where he dwelt with trenches, ramparts, or fortifications, such as his fears put him upon, and does not determine it to any mode of building. Digging downward for habita∣tion, both before and long after the flood, appears to have been the common and general prac∣tice, and Nature's first genuine method, which men departed from either through distrust or ignorance of God's providence, lest there should be a second deluge; or as the fear of wild
<PB N="50" REF="53"/>beasts, or of each other grown wild or savage, prevailed over Nature's present or more simple recourse for habitation; or as the local inconveniences of the foundering in the natural mould might put them here and there upon artificial walls and roofs; or as suffocating damps or sul∣phureous steams and exhalations made them continue building upwards as an expedient; or as the nearness of the springs would not permit them to sink houses, but forced them to above∣ground habitations: this not being a thing of choice but necessity, a violence offered to natural dictate and disposition, men went no further nor faster into them than just in the simplest man∣ner, to avoid inconvenience that put them upon it, so as to live above ground with as much resemblance still as possible to living under ground; either raising an artificial bank, and then scooping out the earth from the side, for even mud walls were not presently invented, till some superior and happy genius discovered the tempering of the artificial paste, and the use of it now so vulgar and universal, which was once the secret and rarity of the age: however now the prejudices from the reverse of custom, and the modern refinements of artificial dwellings has turned the ideas and very thoughts of subterraneous living within walls, and under roofs of earth, of Nature's disposing, into contempt and ridicule, and we laugh at the simplicity and extream awkwardness of the thing, yet we continue to pay regard to the name, and while we spurn the substance, load the shadow with dignity and pre-eminence, and make it a title of preference to all that culture and elegance of modern architecture that has succeeded it.—All the first settled habitations were <HI>caves,</HI> nor is it likely there were houses, unless stationary places of defence before, or for some generations after the <HI>flood.</HI> Had architecture been presently from the creation invented, or been natural, yet it is not likely there were any materials in the first ages to build withall, for they would require considerable time for their generation, there be∣ing few stones, and still fewer quarries to be supposed perfectly formed, the rocks requiring ages to bring them to a firmness beyond paste; nor were the mines of metals hastily ripened to a hardness for tools: nor are we sure that woods or timber trees were created mature, or enew to be employed in building, till they had by God's command propagated their several kinds. <HI>Brick,</HI> therefore, or naked earth, was of necessity, probably, not choice, the first material of architecture, and the only one, which nevertheless must have been unserviceable, had not the natural ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>station of <HI>bitumen</HI> upon the spot luckily supplied the want of cement, to the first undertakers: for from the creation to the building of the <HI>tower of Babel,</HI> they had none at all of an artificial sort, 'tis plain from the text, so never had built.</P>
<P>The best therefore that we can suppose of our top <HI>British mansions and towns,</HI> when the name of <HI>borroughs</HI> was imposed on them, in the barbarous state the inhabitants were then in, is, that they came up to the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uts</HI> of the <HI>Hottentots,</HI> or <HI>Indian Savages,</HI> or other uncultivated tribes of men: and if their houses stood above ground, yet they were such <HI>congesta culmina <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>espite,</HI> or extempore hovels, as our beggars now but make against banks of the road side; one degree removed from subterranean, if at all: they lived under earth, if not under ground; and indeed what are our houses still, but supplemental caves above ground?</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="54"/>Nor does the antique mode of living under ground seem to have gone off at once, but by degrees by little and little, since it is hardly yet quite worn out: it is but lately that the fashion of ascending to houses has much prevailed, most old houses may be observed to be descended into by steps, and floors laid a good deal below the level, with expence to have them so; which is to be ascribed either to nature, or to a remain of the old <HI>British genius and custom</HI> of under∣ground living still <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>icking in us.</P>
<P>The old pavements of your <HI>opus tesselatum,</HI> are generally found so low in the ground, that I cannot see how they can be so well supposed to be either so far overgrown, or sunk beneath the surface, but rather to have been designedly at first laid under ground, though by <HI>Roman</HI> hands, in compliance with the natives' mode of under-ground habitations.</P>
<P>Nor is it an unlikely conjecture, that the vast and various cavities under ground, such as those of the <HI>Peak</HI> and <HI>Wookey</HI> or <HI>O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ey Hole,</HI> near <HI>Wells.</HI><NOTE N="*">These are without doubt natural, and ne∣ver could be habitable.</NOTE> and a great many others less famous, may not be all the work of nature, but in great mea∣sure the effects of under-ground architecture, by men's cultivating the dispositions of nature: and as they look like the <HI>palaces</HI> of some <HI>old Giants,</HI> so they might be the <HI>Windsors</HI> and <HI>Hampton Cour<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> of their times; when under-ground dwell∣ings were in fashion, and once admired no less for <HI>magnificence,</HI> than now for prospects of <HI>wild∣ness</HI> and <HI>horror.</HI> I know no hypothesis that can account so well for all those odd hollows, sink∣ings in the ground, and pits that are every where to be met withall, and in some places too many, and too regular to have happened there by chance,<NOTE N="†">As just by Not∣tingham.</NOTE> and yet one cannot imagine that they should have been made there for any purposes above ground, but as they are the manifest foundering in of subterranean caves by length of time, why might they not be the work of men for habitation, when <HI>burrough life</HI> was in fashion? Abundance of these kinds of large basons I remember when I was a boy in <HI>Ripon Common,</HI> in Yorkshire, and a great many in a neighbouring <HI>Heath,</HI> and <HI>hard by here,</HI> &amp;c.<NOTE N="‡">Dorchester.</NOTE></P>
<P>After under-ground living was generally quitted, as to natural and civil life, yet we find how <HI>devotion</HI> and <HI>superstition</HI> still loved to keep it on, by under-ground <HI>cells, chapels, and ora∣tories:</HI> nor is it to the disadvantage of <HI>burrough life,</HI> that so many of those, of whom the world was not worthy, are said to have dwelt in <HI>dens and caves</HI> of the earth, some of choice, and others for refuge. <HI>Grotius</HI> notes on <HI>Lot's</HI> dwelling in a <HI>cave,</HI> (Genesis xix. 30.) that <HI>Strabo</HI> re∣lates there were abundance of <HI>caves</HI> in that country, which being one of those that were first inhabited, strengthens the thought that they came not there by chance, but were made by the men for habitation, though by change of custom difused; and the abundance of them in all countries that admit of it, confirms the same truth, as to their several aborigines.</P>
<P>That there are fewer <HI>burroughs</HI> in our lower and flat countries, and part of the nation, tho' otherwise more populous, and better stocked with modern towns, than the hilly parts, may also proceed from their being less commodious for the <HI>burrough life</HI> then in vogue; which may be one reason why <HI>Cornwall</HI> has in it more <HI>burroughs,</HI> in proportion, than any other county, and where the aboriginal inclination to <HI>burrough life</HI> very remarkably also exemplified itself among the inhabitants, as many of which almost are said to live in <HI>burroughs</HI> in the old sense of the word, as in those above ground.</P>
<P>The <HI>Romans</HI> indeed represent the <HI>Britons,</HI> when they found them, as living in <HI>huts of reeds or wood,</HI> and their <HI>towns</HI> as so many <HI>woods;</HI> but the <HI>Britons,</HI> who knew themselves best, cannot be supposed, without reason and propriety, to have given a name to their habitations, that speaks them to have been of another nature; against which no foreign testimony can so far pre∣vail, as to make us think otherwise, but that in some period of time or other, either then, be∣fore, or since, the inhabitants notions of dwelling were agreeable to what that name expressed, and that considerable dispositions were made actually among themselves accordingly.</P>
<P>The name <HI>burrough</HI> appears to have travelled hither from <HI>Germany</HI> and the <HI>North,</HI> whence we were first peopled, and where a great many of their oldest and most considerable towns carry <HI>burgh</HI> and <HI>burrough</HI> in their name; and the thing itself, in the colder climates, as I have hinted, is pretty near kept up to. The infamous custom of <HI>incestuous community of wives,</HI> which <HI>Caesar</HI> takes notice of among the <HI>Britons,</HI> and says they had ten or twelve of them wives together in common, especially brothers with one another, and parents with their children, very well agrees with <HI>burrough living;</HI> for families cohabiting in one common room together, without partition, and that suited such works of darkness, must of course fall by that means into such
<PB N="52" REF="55"/>unnatural practice;<NOTE N="*">He must mean <HI>Ga∣v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ed,</HI> for by <HI>Borrough English</HI> the inheritance goes to the youngest child only.</NOTE> and that sort of odd tenure which they call <HI>Burrough English,</HI> must as naturally as necessarily arise again from men's having community of wives; for where men could not know which were their own, which others children; it of course drew them into the agreement of letting <HI>all fare alike.</HI></P>
<P>The invention of this tenure of <HI>Burrough English,</HI> has likewise raised a thought in my head con∣cerning the etymology of the name <HI>England</HI> itself, that falls in with what I have said of <HI>burroughs,</HI> from an old word still in use in the North, which is <HI>angle,</HI> and signifies a hole that runs under ground, on the branch of a mine. From the old word that worm takes its name, whose use for baits has given the name of angling when we fish with it, it is not unlikely but the name of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Angle-land</HI> might also come from living in subterraneous caverns, a <HI>burrough</HI> differ∣ing from an <HI>angle,</HI> as a part from the whole, a <HI>house</HI> from a <HI>town,</HI> or one <HI>room</HI> from a <HI>house.</HI> If we suppose some of those <HI>burroughs,</HI> like the <HI>cave of Machpelah,</HI> double,<NOTE N="†">Genesis. ch. xxiii. but there is nothing said of its being dou∣ble there.</NOTE> that is running in several ways from one common mouth, so that <HI>Eng∣lishmen,</HI> was as much as to say <HI>Burroughmen</HI> or <HI>cavern-livers,</HI> the very same as <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, which example makes it more likely, and which I think is a much better conjecture than from <HI>Angulus,</HI> or their living in a corner, or from <HI>angling,</HI> or from <HI>Angelus,</HI> the story of the Pope's admiring the English boys; which <HI>paultry</HI> etymologies yet are thought worthy of a place in our Antiquities. That the name of <HI>England</HI> or <HI>English∣man,</HI><NOTE N="*">By this argument the Britons could never be called <HI>burrough-livers,</HI> as he before supposes, since the name of <HI>Eng∣land</HI> was unknown till long after the arrival of the <HI>Saxons.</HI></NOTE> as it is thus of <HI>cognate</HI> signification, may come from the word <HI>angle,</HI> which is the same thing almost as <HI>burrough,</HI> is still more likely from hence, that the <HI>Angles</HI> or <HI>Angle-livers</HI> have their original fixed in that same quarter, whence, as has been observed, <HI>burrough</HI> came, and so the two words give mutually light to one another, and strength to what I have observed; the native force of the one supports the denominative title of the other, and with an equal propriety, had arbitrary custom hap∣pened to have made the counter-change of application, the <HI>kingdom</HI> might have been called <HI>Burroughland,</HI> and our <HI>towns</HI> for <HI>burroughs, angles.</HI></P>

In order to extort from the inhabitants a discovery of their money and effects, he caused to be hung up men and women by the joints of their hands and feet, and inflicted on them various other bodily pains.

<P>Alexander King of Scotland, still remaining under sentence of ex∣communication, for his adherence to <HI>Louis,</HI> who had been invited to accept the Crown of England by King John's dissident Barons, after peace was made with King Henry III. and on Alexander's acceding thereto, the Pope's Legate gave authority to the <HI>Archbishop of York</HI> and <HI>Bishop of Durham</HI> to give him absolution; for which purpose they met the King at <HI>Berwick.</HI> This event happened in the year 1217.</P>
<P>In the year 1235, <HI>Gilbert Earl of Pembroke,</HI> Earl Marshal of England, on his marriage with Marjory, sister of Alexander II. King of Scotland, came to <HI>Berwick</HI> to receive his bride, and celebrate his nuptials.</P>
<P>In the year 1266, <HI>Edmond</HI> the younger son of King Henry III. after being invested with the dukedom of Lancaster, and the forfeited ho∣nours and estates of the Earl of Leicester, paid a visit to the King and Queen of Scotland at <HI>Berwick,</HI> where the King with a numerous assem∣bly of his Nobles celebrated the royal birth-day.</P>
<P>The great assembly of the states of England and Scotland was held here, on the 2d day of August 1291, for determining the claims of the several competitors for the Crown of Scotland, in pursuance of the ad∣journment from <HI>Norham,</HI> in the preceding June. King Edward I. re∣ceived the Prelates and Nobles of both kingdoms in the chapel of the castle: after which the Bishops, Prelates, Earls, Barons, Knights, and people of both nations, were convened in the castle of Berwick, and the Delegates were commanded to assemble for receiving the claims, in the deserted church of the Dominicans, adjacent to the castle. An adjourn∣ment was made to the same place in the month of June in the follow∣ing year, where the King again appeared in person, and difficulties still remaining unsolved, a further adjournment was made to the ensuing October, at which time his Majesty, attended as before, again came to <HI>Berwick.</HI> Several intermediate days being given for solving the inci∣dent

questions which arose on the claims, the 17th day of November, A. D. 1292, was appointed for giving judgment, in the hall of the castle, when <HI>John Baliol</HI> was pronounced successor to the Crown. The seal used by those who had governed Scotland during the interregnum, was broken in four parts, and delivered up to King Edward to be de∣posited in his treasury, as a monument and evidence of the sovereignty and direct dominion of that Monarch over Scotland.</P>

<P>The accounts given of these successes of King Edward are various, and authors differ much in regard to the slaughter which attended them. The King being encamped near the <HI>nunnery,</HI> offered terms of peace, which after being demurred upon for two days, were rejected by the garrison. On the next day, being Thursday after Easter, A. D. 1296, the English army was drawn up, on an extensive plain, near the nunnery, at the eastern foot of <HI>Hallydown Hill,</HI> in full view of <HI>Berwick Castle</HI> and the high parts of the town. There the King conferred the honour of Knighthood on <HI>Henry Percy</HI> and others, as was usual in those

times, on the like occasions. The navy perceiving the display of ban∣ners from the mouth of the Tweed, where the fleet then lay, and pre∣suming the attack was beginning, anxious to win part of the laurels of the day, pushed over the bar, and gained the haven; by which three ships were lost, having stranded, where they were burnt by the towns∣men: the rest were scarce able to escape in the ebb tide. King Edward desirous to save his fleet, ordered an immediate attack, whilst the chief part of the garrison was employed in defending the town nearest the haven. He is charged by Fordun and other Scottish writers with using a delusive artifice, in detaching a body of men, under the cover of some rising grounds, to gain an approach on another quarter, and by dis∣playing Scotch colours, induce the garrison to permit their advanc∣ing near the fortifications, under a presumption that they were a rein∣forcement for the town. The English authors take no notice of this stratagem. It appears from the best authorities, that the fortifications of this place, at that time, consisted chiefly of a ditch, and a rampier of earth with a barricado of timber: through these the English army made their entrance with very little difficulty, and the garrison and in∣habitants, astonished at the suddenness of the event, and overwhelmed by superior force, were slaughtered without much resistance. The chief opposition that was made, was by 30 Flandrian Merchants, who held out a strong tower, called the <HI>Red Hall,</HI> till the evening, when fire be∣ing set to it, the building was consumed, and all within perished. In the reduction of this tower, the brother of the <HI>Earl of Cornwall,</HI> a va∣liant Knight, was slain by a spear's piercing his eye, as he looked up to those who fought above. All the gentlemen and fighting men of Fife are said to have been put to the sword. The <HI>castle,</HI> commanded by <HI>William Douglas,</HI> surrendered the same day, and its garrison, consisting of 200 men, were permitted to march out armed, on swearing from thenceforth not to fight against the King or kingdom of England; but their Governor was detained a prisoner. Fordun says the number of slain was 7500; that the streets ran with blood two days, and in such quantities as to make mills go. Boetheus says also the slain were about 7000 in number, and says that mills were actually set a-going with the blood. Matthew Westminster says, that all were slain, without distinc∣tion of sex or age, in number 60,000. In the instructions from the Regency and Council of Scotland, to their Procurators at Rome, A. D. 1301, it is said, that after taking <HI>Berwick,</HI> the King and his army com∣mitted the most barbarous cruelties on the inhabitants, who to the num∣ber of almost 8000 were slain, without distinction of character, sex, or
<PB N="56" REF="59"/>
age. The churches afforded no protection to those who fled thither; after being defiled with the blood of the slain, and spoiled of all their ornaments, the King and his followers made stables of them for the horses of the army.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In these instructions there is the following charge against King Edward:—That he had violently seized Baliol's person and kingdom, and compelled his Chancellor to resign his great seal: and after Baliol and his son were sent prisoners to London, he caused letters of resigna∣tion to be forged, and afterwards published them to the inhabitants of Scotland, although they never were, nor should be ratified by Baliol.</NOTE> This carnage may be ascribed to a resentment of the cruelties committed the preceding year by the men of <HI>Berwick</HI> and the fighting men of <HI>Fife,</HI> in attacking certain English vessels that had entered the port, setting fire to the ships, and putting the several crews to death.</P>
<P>On the 24th day of August, A. D. 1296, the King received the ho∣mage <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P>The oath of fealty then administered:</P>

<P>King Edward, in the year 1303, mustered that victorious army here, with which he penetrated the remotest parts of Scotland, and compleated its conquest.</P>
<P>In the year 1305, <HI>Wallace</HI> having been betrayed into the hands of his enemies, suffered an ignominious execution, and half of his body was ordered to be exposed on Berwick Bridge. In the succeeding year, <HI>Neal Bruce,</HI> brother of Robert Bruce, was taken in the castle of Kil∣drummy, with many other persons of great distinction, who were sent prisoners to Berwick, where King Edward ordered them to be tried by Justices sent thither, by whom they were condemned, and sentenced to be hanged, drawn, and quartered. <HI>The Countess of Buchan,</HI> sister to the <HI>Earl of Fife,</HI> eloped from <HI>John Comyn</HI> her husband, and carried in her retinue all his war-horses, with which she repaired to <HI>Robert Bruce,</HI> at <HI>Scone,</HI> and in the absence of the Earl her brother, who was then with the King of England, and whose hereditary office it was to place the crown on the heads of the Scotch Monarchs, she assumed that high duty, and put the diadem on the head of <HI>Bruce.</HI> King Edward sen∣teaced her to be shut up in a wooden cage, in one of the towers of Ber∣wick Castle.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Redpat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'s Border hist. p. 229.</NOTE> From the order set forth by Rymer, it appears, that the Chamberlain of Scotland, or his Lieutenant at Berwick, was to cause this cage to be made of sufficient strength; in which she was to be at∣tended and served by one or two English women of the town of Berwick, and no Scotch man or woman, or any other person, except the servant or servants appointed her, were to be suffered to have access to her.

<P>In the year 1307, the stores ordered by the King of England to be delivered by the citizens of London at <HI>Berwick,</HI> for the use of the forces against the Scots, were 20 barrels of honey, 100 barrels of wine, 12,000 lb. weight of iron, 500 lb. of hemp-cord for balistae, 500lb. of hemp, 100 balistae of one foot, 40 of two feet, 20 balistae de turno, 30,000 arrows for balistae of one foot, 12,000 arrows for those of two feet, 2200 feathered arrows of copper for balistae de turno.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rymer.

<P>In the year 1310, King Edward II. his Queen, and Nobles, spent their winter at Berwick; the King returning thither from his Scotch expedition. The dearth was so great in Scotland this year, that the people fed on horse-flesh and other carrion.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid. 226.</NOTE> During the King's resi∣dence here, he confirmed the election of Richard de Kellow to the See of Durham, on the death of Anthony de Beck.</P>
<P>In 1312, <HI>Robert Bruce</HI> attempted to surprize <HI>Berwick,</HI> by a scalade in the night; but after ladders of ropes were fixed, the place was saved by the barking of a dog, which alarmed the garrison, and the assailants were repulsed with considerable loss.</P>
<P>In the year 1314, King Edward II. rendezvoused his army at <HI>Ber∣wick,</HI> consisting of 40,000 horse (three thousand of which were com∣pleatly armed, horses and men) and 52,000 foot: they were in part lodged within the town, and the rest in tents without the walls. The carriages attending this army were numerous, as no supplies could be drawn from a country desolated by war, and wasted by famine. Malms∣bury says, if they had passed in one line, they would have extended sixty leagues in length. Most authors agree, that so fine an army had
<PB N="60" REF="63"/>
not in the memory of man marched from England. The army of the Scots consisted of 30,000, advantageously posted, and waiting the ap∣proach of the English, on the banks of <HI>Bannocks Burn.</HI> I seem to be led involuntarily to a relation of this battle; famous, for the establish∣ment of <HI>Robert Bruce</HI> on the throne of Scotland, in its event.</P>
<P><HI>Sterling Castle</HI> had sustained a long siege and blockade, and the Go∣vernor was at length obliged to accede to certain articles, under which, if this fortress was not relieved before an appointed day, it was to be surrendered to <HI>Bruce:</HI> King Edward determined to march to its relief, and with all possible expedition moved his army from Berwick. <HI>Robert Bruce,</HI> informed of the intention of the English Monarch, resolved to abide the event of a battle, rather than raise the siege. He had viewed the ground, and fixed upon a part near the castle, where he should have only just sufficient room to marshal his troops with advantage, accord∣ing to their arms. This place was defended on the one hand by in∣accessible rocks, and on the other by a morass, having the water of Bannokburn in front. King Edward being informed the country near Sterling was full of morasses, and difficult to be passed, so that his horse could not be of the service he wished, he levied a reinforcement of foot, 4000 from Yorkshire, 2500 from Northumberland, 1500 from Durham, and 2000 from Derby and Nottingham. In the advance the army was divided into ten columns, 10,000 men in each, commanded by leaders of the most distinguished character; the <HI>Earls of Gloucester and Hereford</HI> led the van, the center was led by the <HI>King</HI> in person, <HI>Sir Giles D'Argentein</HI> and <HI>Aymer de Valence, Earl of Pembroke,</HI> Generals un∣der him. The army under these divisions, is said to have covered a large tract of country, and was a sight august and solemn; the whole scene made resplendent, by burnished arms and displayed ensigns.</P>
<P>As the English approached, <HI>Bruce</HI> led his troops to occupy the chosen ground, on the Saturday before the battle. To strengthen the station, he caused pits to be dug in front, armed with pointed stakes within, covered with hurdles or flakes, and concealed by turfs and rushes. On the morning of Sunday, being Midsummer Eve, <HI>Bruce</HI> with his Lords and Chieftains attended solemn devotions and mass in the front of the army; and the Priests went through the ranks, exhorting each soldier <Q>to exert his powers for the relief of his country, and rather die a martyr in the virtuous cause, than see the English again become ty∣rannical task-masters, as they had been in the time of King Edward I.
<PB N="61" REF="64"/>
of detested memory.</Q> Such arguments and exhortations served to inflame the Scotch army with enthusiastic ardour. The English were ordered to advance so near <HI>Bruce</HI>'s station; on Sunday evening, that though harrassed with a tedious march, they were obliged to lay under arms all night, for fear of a surprize. This evening was not without several skirmishes and re-encounters, in which the English were worsted: in one of these <HI>Robert Bruce</HI> engaged and slew <HI>Sir Henry Boynton;</HI> cleav∣ing his head with a battle ax. A party of 300 horse, under the com∣mand of <HI>Lord Robert Clifford</HI> and <HI>Henry Beaumont,</HI> attempting to gain the castle, were engaged by a chosen band of Spearmen, led by <HI>Earl Murray,</HI> and put to the rout: <HI>Sir William Dayncourt</HI> was slain, and <HI>Thomas Gray</HI> made prisoner;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lel. Coll.</NOTE> the <HI>Earl of Gloucester</HI> was unhorsed, but rescued.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Malmsbury.</NOTE></P>
<P>The disposition of the Scotch army on the day of battle was in four divisions: <HI>Sir Thomas Randolph</HI> commanded the van, <HI>Edward Bruce</HI> the right wing, and <HI>Sir James Douglas</HI> the left; <HI>Robert Bruce</HI> was with the body of reserve or rear. The Scotch were all on foot, that by ma∣king the danger and distress of the engagement equal, the ardour of each might by example be exhilerated. The soldiers of the body of re∣serve, were covered with light coats of mail, which a sword could not penetrate: they carried an ax in the belt, and lances in their hands. Malmsbury describes the Scotch army moving, "as thick as a hedge." The leaders were men of that skill and valour, that they possessed the confidence of the troops. In the English army, the foot, consisting of spearmen and archers, were in the van, the horse were on each flank; and in these positions the armies engaged.</P>
<P>The onset was vigorous and well maintained on both sides. The <HI>Earl of Gloucester</HI> commanded that part of the line which was attacked by <HI>Sir James Douglas's</HI> corps, consisting of 7000 Borderers and 3000 Irish Scots or Katerans, vulgarly called Redshanks, a fierce and valiant race. The English, unable to sustain the shock, began to give way, when the Earl, impatient of disgrace and inflamed with ire, accompanied by a chosen band, rushed into the thickest of the foes, where he was beaten from his horse and slain. The covered pits deterred or frustrated his Knights from effecting his rescue. Malmsbury says, with great warmth,
<PB N="62" REF="65"/>
(confundat eos Dominos) they were 500 in number, and in the emer∣gency 20 might have effected his relief. <HI>Sir Giles D'Argentein,</HI> a man much esteemed by <HI>Robert Bruce,</HI> and of great military fame, one of the Commanders of the <HI>Gens d' Armes</HI> who guarded the King, advanced to <HI>Gloucester's</HI> relief, but died in the attempt. <HI>Robert de Clifford, Payen de Tiptoft, William Marescal, Edmund Mayley,</HI> and several other eminent leaders were equally unfortunate in those parts of the army where they commanded, and were soon numbered with the slain. The English archers, who had so often carried victory with them in former conflicts, were attacked in flank, and put to the rout, by a troop of light cavalry close armed, who were remounted for this critical service, and led by <HI>Sir Robert Keith,</HI> Marshal of Scotland. The confusion among the archers, and the fall of such eminent leaders, struck the English army with a panic, which was not a little increased by the sight of a large body of men advancing over the summit of a distant eminence, who were no other than the attendants on the carriages and baggage, drawn up in martial array, and displaying pieces of linen on the ends of spears, which at that distance appeared like a crowd of banners. Confusion and uproar soon took place, and the English Monarch was advised to secure his retreat, as Victory was declaring on every hand for <HI>Bruce,</HI> and the English forces, wearied and fainting, were giving way. The King with great reluctance and shame consented to move the royal standard, the sight of which compleated what the valour of the Scotch phalanx had so gloriously begun: the rout became general, and mul∣titudes fell as well under the sword in the pursuit, as in the waters of <HI>Bannockburn</HI> and <HI>Forth.</HI> The effusion of blood was greatly spared, by the avarice of plunder, the rich baggage of the English army affording immense booty to the victors. Of the Scots, only two leaders of note fell, <HI>William Vipont</HI> and <HI>Walter Ross.</HI> Seven hundred English Gentle∣men were missing after the battle, the greatest part of whom were among the prisoners. <HI>Sterling</HI> surrendered to the King of Scotland, who ordered the fortifications to be destroyed to their foundations. Redpath, in his Border History, says, <Q>The rout of the English was indeed very entire; but neither the number they brought to the field, nor the loss they sustained, appear to have been nigh so great as the Scottish writers represent them.</Q></P>
<P><HI>King Robert Bruce</HI> treated the prisoners with great humanity, and buried the dead with all due decorum. The bodies of the <HI>Earl of Glou∣cester</HI> and <HI>Lord Robert Clifford,</HI> he sent to the King at <HI>Berwick,</HI> to be in∣terred
<PB N="63" REF="66"/>
with the honours due to their rank and military fame. On ac∣count of a personal friendship which had formerly subsisted between them, he liberated without ransom his prisoner <HI>Lord Ralph de Moun∣thermer,</HI> husband to the Countess of Gloucester, the King of England's sister.</P>
<P>King Edward with a body of horse fled towards <HI>Berwick,</HI> pursued by <HI>Sir James Douglas</HI> with a party of light cavalry, who effected no∣thing but taking up a few stragglers, who fell off from the King's troop. He first took shelter in the castle of <HI>Dunbar,</HI> from whence he was con∣veyed by sea to <HI>Bambrough</HI> or <HI>Berwick.</HI> It is certain he was at <HI>Berwick</HI> the third day after this defeat, as he issued a proclamation from thence, to advise his subjects of the loss of his <HI>privy seal;</HI> which was restored to him by <HI>Mounthermer,</HI> on his return.</P>
<P>After this victory, various bands of Scots ravaged Northumberland.</P>
<P>In the year 1315, the Scots attempted to take <HI>Berwick</HI> by surprize, by means of their shipping, with which they entered the river under false colours; but being discovered by the garrison before they began an attack, suffered considerable loss e'er they could effect an escape.</P>
<P>In the following year, the dearth was so great in Northumberland, that the people were obliged to eat the flesh of horses and dogs. A quarter of wheat sold for 40 shillings.</P>
<P><HI>Berwick</HI> had continued in the possession of the English for 20 years, when the Commander in the town being corrupted, betrayed it to the <HI>Earl of Murray,</HI> in the year 1318, who led a body of <HI>Robert Bruce</HI>'s forces.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>James Duglas, by the helpe of Patrike Counte of March, and Peter Spalding of Berwike got Berwike owt of the Englischmennes handes.

<P>Barber, the Historian of Bruce, says, that one <HI>Spalding,</HI> incensed against the Governor's cruelty towards the Scotch inhabitants, had de∣termined to betray the town into the hands of Bruce's party; and ac∣cordingly
<PB N="64" REF="67"/>
having intimated his design, and assigned the time and place for the enterprize, when it was his turn to mount guard at the <HI>Cow∣gate, Randolph</HI> and <HI>Douglas,</HI> with a chosen band, repaired to <HI>Dunse Park,</HI> and under cover of the night, advanced to a part of the wall which was left unguarded, and by ladders entered the town, unper∣ceived by any but <HI>Spalding.</HI> They lay concealed till day-light, when other forces coming up, upon the assault, were aided by those within, and gained the place by noon. Many of the garrison and townsmen retired into the castle, from whence they made a sally, presuming the Scotch forces were weak, from the thin display of banners; but they were repulsed with some loss. The news of regaining <HI>Berwick</HI> was soon spread over the adjacent country, and numbers of Scotch crowded thither, to maintain the place and assist in the siege of the castle, which stood out six days,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This differs widely from Leland's account.</NOTE> and then capitulated on terms, for the garrison to march out with their arms, and depart for England. The Scotch King <HI>Robert Bruce</HI> soon after arrived, and with his Court resided some time in the castle. He made his son-in-law, <HI>Walter, Steward of Scotland,</HI> Governor, who, ambitious of possessing a settlement on the borders, where he might display his youthful courage, called out 500 Gentlemen his dependents, with others of inferior rank, skilful in shooting with bows and working engines, for the more effectual defence of the place. <HI>Sir John Crab,</HI> a Fleming, of high reputation in his art, was made chief Engineer.</P>
<P>King Edward, in the succeeding year, prepared to recover <HI>Berwick,</HI> and on the first of September approached with a large body of troops, having with him <HI>Lancaster, Pembroke, Arundell, Hertford, Warren,</HI> and the <HI>Earl Marshal</HI> the King's brother, <HI>Hugh D'Espencer, Roger de Tam∣mori,</HI> and <HI>Hugh Deudeley,</HI> parceners to the earldom of Gloucester, by marriage of the coheiresses, the late Earl's sisters. This force was ac∣companied by a fleet from the cinque ports, laden with provisions and all kind of stores. The English fortified their camp, and then pro∣ceeded to an assault. The walls of the town are described to be so low, that an assailant might strike the people that defended them, with a spear. On the seventh of September they attempted an escalade, at dif∣ferent parts in the same time, and a ship was directed to approach with an engine, to attempt the walls on the side next the haven; but all
<PB N="65" REF="68"/>
these were fruitless, the ship was left on ground by ebb of tide, and burnt by the garrison. In the next general assault, which was made on the 13th of September, the English employed a great machine called a <HI>Sow,</HI> constructed for holding and defending men, who were moved in it towards the foot of the wall, in order to undermine and sap its foundation. Devices were used to burn this machine, but by throwing a stone of vast weight from an engine, the Sow was split, and her oc∣cupiers dislodged. On an attack of <HI>Marygate,</HI> the draw bridge was burnt, and the gate in great danger; but forces from the castle coming to its defence, the assailants were obliged to retire. These efforts har∣rassed and weakened the garrison considerably, and the town must on another assault, have fallen into the hands of the English, if Lancaster had not withdrawn his forces from the camp, exercising his malignant spirit at this critical time against the King, whom he hated most inve∣terately. The <HI>Earl of Murray</HI> and <HI>Lord Douglas</HI> had entered England with 10,000 chosen men, and penetrated almost to the city of <HI>York,</HI> the Queen escaping with difficulty. These circumstances determined Edward to raise the siege of <HI>Berwick.</HI></P>
<P><HI>King Robert Bruce</HI> perceiving the importance of this place, strength∣ened the walls, and raised them considerably in height, giving also many new towers and additional bulwarks to the whole.</P>
<P>In the year 1323, <HI>King Robert Bruce</HI> at this place ratified the treaty of peace entered into with King Edward III. by his plenipotentiaries at <HI>Bishop Thorpe</HI> near <HI>York.</HI></P>
<P>In 1328, <HI>Joan</HI> the sister of King Edward III. being contracted to <HI>David</HI> the son and heir of <HI>King Robert Bruce,</HI> was conveyed to <HI>Berwick</HI> with a splendid retinue, where she was received by the <HI>Earl of Murray</HI> and <HI>Lord Douglas,</HI> representatives of the King, he being sick; and the nuptials were celebrated with great magnificence. She was called <HI>Make Peace,</HI> and carried with her the ragman roll, and all records which had been seized by King Edward I. to be again deposited in the Scotch archives.</P>
<P>At this ceremony, a magnificent parade was made by the nobles of each nation, and a sumptuous pageant crowded the place, with all that solemn pomp, which in the days of chivalry decked out public specta∣cles: Sumptured horses, and men braced in shining arms, forming long
<PB N="66" REF="69"/>
trains of steel effigies, stiffened in coats of mail, and strapped like inani∣mate beings to the saddle, were the chief objects: <HI>Lord Mortimers'</HI> retinue alone, consisted of nine score Knights, properly caparisoned, with their Esquires, Gentlemen, and Yeomen.</P>
<P>The expedition of <HI>Lord Henry Beaumont</HI> and his associates into Scot∣land, in the year 1332, being attended with remarkable success, be∣came an object of serious attention with the English Monarch; in so much that <HI>Edward Baliol,</HI> supported by this party in his pretensions to the Crown of Scotland, as successor of his father <HI>John Baliol,</HI> having gained the castle of <HI>Roxburgh,</HI> King Edward received his letters patent issued from thence, in which he acknowledged the King of England supreme Lord of Scotland, and ceded to him the <HI>town, castle, and coun∣ty of Berwick,</HI> to be annexed to his kingdom, with many other advan∣tageous cessions and terms of amity and alliance, of such weight and consideration, that the King summoned his parliament to meet at <HI>York,</HI> to deliberate thereon. As many of the states, especially the Prelates were absent, nothing was determined: in general, it was thought expe∣dient to treat with the guardian and nobles of <HI>King David</HI>'s party; for which purpose commissioners were instructed to require homage and fealty from the Scotch King, and a cession of <HI>Berwick;</HI> but these requi∣sitions were rejected with the utmost disdain. <HI>Baliol</HI> during this time had a perilous escape from <HI>Annan,</HI> and was obliged to take refuge in England, his party being thrown into the utmost confusion. King Edward was too far advanced in the cause to recede, and therefore ac∣cepted the terms proposed by <HI>Baliol</HI> at <HI>Roxburgh,</HI> and ratified them on his part.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Edward Baliol gave up Berwick, Roxburg, Dedinburg, Pebilles, and Dunfres, to King Edward, and promisid to make hym homage for the resideu, after that the hole Englisch Hoste had faught with the Scottes, and had so great a victory of the toune of Berwick, was gyven up to King Edward.</P>

<P>The English did not recover <HI>Berwick,</HI> till the 7th year of the reign of King Edward III. after the battle of <HI>Halydoun Hill,</HI> where the slaugh∣ter of the Scottish forces was terrible, 7 Earls, 900 Knights, 400 Esquires, and 32,000 common men died in the field; a carnage dread∣ful to recount, and from the very idea of which the soul recoils with horror.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="70"/><HI>King Edward the Third,</HI> on being refused the homage of <HI>David Bruce,</HI> and restitution of <HI>Berwick,</HI> ordered his Herald to proclaim his defiance of the Scotch King. The English army began to besiege <HI>Berwick</HI> on the 12th of April, 1333. The Scots knowing the reduction of this place would be one of the first and chief enterprizes of their adversa∣ries, to the utmost of their power put it in a state of defence, to resist the great shock they presumed it would necessarily sustain: they filled it with a garrison of chosen veterans, and made <HI>Sir William Keith</HI> gover∣nor of the <HI>town,</HI> and <HI>Patrick Earl of Dunbar</HI> the keeper of the chief fortress or citadel. The King soon arrived, and remained in person before the walls about a month, when perceiving from the strength of the garrison, and the vigorous defence they made, that it would not be easy to reduce the place, he marched part of his army into Scot∣land, carrying the horrid ravages of war as far as <HI>Scone, Dundee,</HI> and <HI>Dumbarton.</HI> The most savage cruelties mark those times; the wild American never devised more shocking barbarities than stained these borders; each nation was ingenious in torture, in modes of devastation, and in the prosecution of revenge. Having glutted their avarice of blood, and being loaded with pillage, they again returned to <HI>Berwick,</HI> which King Edward still found unsubdued. After receiving reinforce∣ments, he declared his determination was either to be master of <HI>Ber∣wick,</HI> or effect something of consequence, by bringing his adversaries to battle. The siege was changed into a strict blockade: the besieged distressed by the cutting off supplies, made many sallies, with various fortune; they made a vigorous attack upon the fleet, and most of the navy then before <HI>Berwick</HI> was burnt. The garrison still entertained hopes of relief, and refused to capitulate, presuming this key to the kingdom, was of too great consequence to the Scotch, at that time to be neglected, and suffered to fall into the hands of the enemy. <HI>Lord Douglas</HI> had levied a powerful army, with which he marched to the neighbourhood of <HI>Berwick;</HI> but to the great distress of the garrison, who believed their day of deliverance was at hand, instead of attacking the English, <HI>Douglas</HI> crossed the Tweed, and in sight of the town, marched along the coast towards <HI>the castle of Bambrough,</HI> which being esteemed impregnable, was chosen by the King of England, as a secure residence for his Queen. The Scotch wasted several days in blocking up that fortress, and ravaging the adjacent parts, hoping that King Edward's sollicitude for his Queen, would induce him to raise the siege of <HI>Berwick.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="71"/>The device which had been practised with effect in the year 1318, did not now take place; King Edward was not to be moved from his determined purpose; the garrison reduced to extremities for want of provisions, and dispirited by the apparent neglect of <HI>Douglas,</HI> proposed a treaty, which King Edward readily attended to, and the capitulation was concluded on the 15th day of July, under the following condi∣tions: That the <HI>town</HI> and <HI>castle</HI> should be surrendered to King Edward on the 20th, if not relieved with 200 men at arms, or by a battle; that in the interval, there should be a cessation of arms; that in case of a surrender, the lives and properties of the garrison and inhabitants should be protected, with liberty to such as were so inclined to leave the place; and that the Governor should have safe conduct granted him to the Scotch army, to communicate the articles. <HI>Sir William Keith</HI> re∣paired to the Scotch camp without delay, and there prevailed that an attempt should be made to relieve the place: a measure totally disap∣proved by some of the oldest and most experienced of the Scotch leaders.</P>
<P>In this interval, a transaction is said to have taken place, which sullies the lustre of Edward's military character, and stamps an odium on his memory; it stands recorded to the following effect, by Bucha∣nan, Boece, and other Scotch authors of great credit.</P>
<P>Hostages were given by the Scots, for performance of their part of the treaty, one of whom was the eldest son of <HI>Sir Alexander Seeton,</HI> who was Deputy Governor, and took command on <HI>Keith's</HI> resorting to the camp. King Edward had also in his camp <HI>Seeton</HI>'s younger son, taken a prisoner at the assault made on the navy. The King apprehending that by the approach of the Scotch army, he might probably be de∣prived of the capture of Berwick, an object of so great importance, soon after the departure of <HI>Keith,</HI> contrary to the faith of Princes, the sacredness of treaties, the common policy of nations, and all private honour, demanded an immediate surrender of the place; threatening if <HI>Seeton</HI> refused, that he would immediately hang up his two sons, the hostage and the prisoner, before the walls. <HI>Seeton</HI> remonstrated, but Edward regardless of all the charges made against him for the violation of public faith, caused a gibbet to be erected in full view of the town, to put in execution his infamous threat. <HI>Seeton</HI> struggling between honour and parental feelings, between duty to his country and love
<PB N="69" REF="72"/>
for his children, suffered all the pangs arising from a conflict, in which every sentiment was on the rack: Nature would have prevailed, and <HI>Seeton</HI>'s children been saved by a sacrifice of his country's honour and his own, had not the mother, with all the virtue and heroism of a Roman matron, and the greatness of the most exalted mind, argued forcibly to support his principle, and sustain his fainting soul; and when yet he seemed to relax, she withdrew him from the horrid spec∣tacle, that he might retain his rectitude, though his sons were the in∣estimable price by which it was maintained. Edward unrelenting, put them to death, and <HI>Seeton</HI> kept the town.</P>
<P>This transaction is denied by the English Historians, who affirm that the Scotch army came in fight before the truce was expired; and there∣fore Edward could have no pretence for demanding a surrender.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Smollet, vol. 2. p. 19.</P>
<P>Tyrell says, on expiration of the truce mentioned by Boece and Buchanan, King Edward summoned the town to surrender; to which Seeton replied, he could not consent thereto, as he had assurances of speedy relief. The King insisted on the terms of the truce, by which the surrender was stipulated, and the time was now expired. Seeton still refused, would have pre∣varicated and argued; which so incensed the King, that by advice of his Council he executed one of Seeton's sons. This act is said to have induced the townsmen whose sons were hostages, to solicit new terms, and additional days for cessation of arms, which King Edward granted.</P>
<P>It does not appear that Seeton's son was an hostage; his name is not in any record of that treaty: but presuming there was a former treaty, which was renewed or prolonged, and of which no record is now in being, this difficulty ceases. Fordun expresly says, King Edward caused Seeton's son Thomas to be executed on a gibbet, in sight of his parents; but agrees with Tyrell, that it was not done till after the time of the treaty was expired.</P></NOTE> This argument is futile, and seems weak in opposition to the uniformity of the Scotch Historians.</P>
<P>On the 18th of July, <HI>Lord Douglas</HI> led his army over the Tweed, and encamped at a place called <HI>Bothull</HI> or <HI>Bothville:</HI> the English possessed <HI>Halydown Hill,</HI> a very considerable eminence on the west of Berwick, having an easy declivity towards the river; the other sides were steeper. The Scotch disregarding this apparent advantage, determined to engage on the Scotch side of the hill, not only to secure a retreat, but in case of victory, to take advantage of the flow of tide, which would render the Tweed impassable to the English if they should be routed.</P>
<P>The Scotch army was disposed in four grand divisions; <HI>John Murray</HI> commanded the first, with <HI>Lord Andrew Frazer</HI> and his sons <HI>Simon</HI> and <HI>James;</HI> the second was commanded by <HI>Robert Lord High Steward of
<PB N="70" REF="73"/>
Scotland,</HI> with the principal men of his kindred and the <HI>Earl of Monteith;</HI> the third by the <HI>Earls of Ross, Sutherland, and Strathern;</HI> and the fourth by <HI>Lord Archibald Douglas,</HI> Guardian of the kingdom of Scotland, and Commander in Chief, accompanied by the Earls of <HI>Lenox</HI> and <HI>Carrick.</HI> The whole army amounted to 68,000. The number of King Edward's army is not positively mentioned by any author. It is supposed the number of the Scotch was not so great as Historians have asserted, and that they were nearly equal to their adversaries. King Edward also disposed his army in four divisions, each of which was flanked by choice and skilful archers.</P>
<P>When both sides were ready to engage, the onset was a while sus∣pended, by the appearance of a Scotchman of gigantic stature, who had gained the name of <HI>Turnbull,</HI> on account of a gallant exploit, by which King Robert Bruce was saved from the attacks of a wild bull, which had unhorsed him, as he was hunting. <HI>Turnbull,</HI> attended by a great mastiff,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Some of the Borderers on the western Marches kept mastiffs or bull-dogs, which were let loose on the ravaging parties —Nicholson and Burn's Hist. West.</NOTE> approached the English army, and gave a challenge for single combat. After a short pause, which the singularity of the cir∣cumstance occasioned, the challenge was accepted by <HI>Sir Robert Benhale,</HI> a young Norfolk Knight, much inferior in stature to the Scotch cham∣pion, but of great strength and adroitness in military atchievements. The mastiff immediately flew forward, and was received by the Knight with a stroke upon the loins with his sword, which severed his body. The Scotch champion advanced: <HI>Benhale,</HI> with great agility and skill, eluded the heavy blows aimed at him, and first cut off the left arm of his adversary, and at last struck off his head.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Stowe.</NOTE></P>
<P>The Scotch army began to ascend the hill about the hour of vespers, with great impetuosity; their leaders, chieftains, and men at arms dis∣mounted, the more to animate the troops by rendering the danger equal. They were soon out of breath, in consequence of ascending the steep. The English archers were advantageously placed, in different stations on the hill, so as to pour down such showers of arrows on the close bodies of the Scotch troops, as made a terrible slaughter: they were also greatly annoyed by the rolling down of large stones from the emi∣nence, and were soon thrown into confusion.<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Smollet, v. 2. p. 19.</NOTE> The English comman∣ders
<PB N="71" REF="74"/>
instantly availing themselves of the enemy's disorder, ordered an attack to be made by the spearmen and men at arms, by which they were pressed whilst breathless and dispirited, so that multitudes fell. The Scotch often retreated, and again rallied and bravely returned to the fight, fiercely maintaining the battle till their General was pierced by a spear: his fall struck the army with a panic, and a total rout ensued. The carnage was dreadful. The servants charged with the care of the horses fled, and left their masters to the destroying sword of a victorious enemy, who were not accustomed to mercy. Edward, at the head of a chosen brigade of cavalry, and archers on horseback, at∣tended by <HI>Lord D' Arcy</HI> with his Irish troops, led on the pursuit, and directed the slaughter. The country for the distance of five miles, was strewed with carcasses of those who were cut down by their pursuers.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Barnes, Fordun, Boece, Buchanan, Knighton, &amp;c.</NOTE> Among the persons of distinction in the Scotch army, there fell the <HI>General,</HI> the <HI>Earls of Ross, Sutherland, Carrick, Athol, Lenox,</HI> and <HI>Mon∣teith;</HI> three <HI>Stewards,</HI> uncles of Robert the Lord High Steward, three <HI>Frazers, Sir John Graham, Sir Duncan Campbell,</HI> and <HI>Sir William Tudway.</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P>Edwardus 3 debellavit Scottos apud Halidon hille, &amp; occidit in illo Bello 35 Millia &amp; postea cepit castrum de Berwicke —Lel.

<P>The loss of the English is not related with certainty by any Historian. Rymer records a note sent by King Edward, to direct a public thanks∣giving after this victory, in which it is said, <Q>that the battle was gained without much loss on his (the King's) side.</Q> This expression implies a loss more considerable than what some authors have set forth, viz. one Knight, one Esquire, and 13 foot soldiers.<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Smollet, &amp;c. &amp;c.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="75"/>On the day after the battle, <HI>the castle and town of Berwick</HI> was sur∣rendered, the King faithfully observing the articles of capitulation. A public thanksgiving was ordered through his dominions, and he made a donation of 20l. per annum to the Cistercian Nuns, near whose con∣vent the battle was fought, with full reparation of all damages done to the conventual church and other buildings; as the author of the Border History says, <Q>thus affecting, like most other conquerors, to draw Heaven to his party; and to regard the success accompanying the most unjust enterprizes, as a proof of the peculiar favour of the Deity.</Q></P>
<P>King Edward determining to retain Berwick, appointed <HI>Lord Henry Percy</HI> Governor of the castle, and gave a commission to him and the Earl of March, to act as joint Wardens of all the country on this side the Scottish sea, where the terms of peace were received. He required 12 hostages for Berwick, to be chosen out of the chief inhabitants; eight of whom he placed at Newcastle, and four at York.</P>
<P>Edward Baliol did homage to King Edward at Newcastle upon Tyne, in June 1334, his parliament having ratified the treaty of Roxburgh, whereby the castle, town, and county of Berwick, with their appen∣dages, were to be annexed to the Crown of England for ever.</P>
<P>In the year 1339, <HI>Lord John Mowbray</HI> was Governor of Berwick: he had in garrison 120 men at arms, 100 halberdiers, and 200 archers.</P>
<P>In 1340, King Edward III. was at Berwick with an army of 40,000 foot and 6000 horse.</P>
<P>In 1341, King Edward kept the festival of Easter here, and held a tournament, in which 12 Knights of Scotland entered the lists with 12 of the King's train. This spectacle was exhibited with great magnifi∣cence and solemn pomp; but from the animosity which subsisted be∣tween the people of the two nations, this exhibition was attended with so much ire and inveteracy, and such bitter rivalship, that two Scotch Knights were slain, and Sir John Twiford, an English Knight.</P>
<P>On the 12th of November, A. D. 1354, a treaty was held at Berwick for the ransom of <HI>David Bruce, King of Scotland,</HI> taken prisoner at the battle of <HI>Durham,</HI> on the 26th of October 1346; and on the 3d of
<PB N="73" REF="76"/>
October 1357, all the articles of treaty for his deliverance were con∣certed there; and the payments of the ransom-money were ordered to be made at Berwick, Norham, or Bambrough. On failure of per∣formance of the former articles, another treaty succeeded, with a truce for 14 years; under which 56,000 marks were to be paid, by yearly in∣stalments of 4000 marks each.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The following papers are in few hands, and as they contain many curious particulars re∣lative to this ransom, it is presumed their insertion will be agreeable to the reader.</P>

<P>During which truce there shall no molestation, damage, injury, assault or enterprise be of∣fered on either side, whether by taking of towns, castles, or fortresses: by burning of houses or other things: by taking and detaining of persons: by plundering of cattle and goods; or by any other hostile act whatsoever; but they shall live, converse, and traffick mutually together, freely, and peaceably, without producing any letters of safe-conduct, and without any arrest, disturbance, or interruption altogether in as much amity as they would, and ought to do in the time of an absolute peace; only paying the dues and customs to one King as well as to the other.</P>
<P>And if any thing chance to be attempted, or committed by either King, or their subjects of either part, contrary to the same, it shall duely, and as soon as may be, without any fraud or delay, be repaired, redressed, and made good to the party that shall be injured; the truce for all that remaining in full force and vertue.</P>
<P>And in like manner, during the term of the said truce, neither the King of <HI>England,</HI> nor of <HI>Scotland,</HI> nor any of their subjects of either kingdom, nor any of their Lords, may be an ill-wisher, adversary, or enemy: nor shall commit any act of hostility, damage, or injury: neither may they be aiding, comforting, or counselling in <HI>England,</HI> or in <HI>Scotland,</HI> or in any place elsewhere, against the Kings and subjects of either kingdom, or of any of their dominions in any manner whatsoever.</P>
<P>And if any of the said subjects do act to the contrary, they shall, in the first place, be requi∣red and commanded by way of <HI>letter</HI> to desist; and, upon neglect thereof, they shall be punished as traytors and rebels, and all their goods be forfeited and confiscated to that King whose subjects they are.</P>
<P>And during the said term, no subject, who may be a rebel, and disobedient to either King, shall be admitted into one kingdom, nor into the other, nor into any of their dominions, whereby he may offer injury and wrong to the said Kings, or to any of their subjects.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="77"/>And the said King of <HI>Scotland,</HI> for the remainder of his ransom, shall pay 56,000 marks in gold, or silver of an equal value, to the King of <HI>England,</HI> or to his heirs or deputies, at <HI>Ber∣wick upon Tweed,</HI> at <HI>Norham,</HI> or at <HI>Bambourgh,</HI> in the space of the foresaid truce.</P>
<P>That is to say, every year 4000 marks, till the whole sum aforesaid shall be paid; whereof the first payment shall commence, in the same manner, as hath been said before, at <HI>Candle∣mas</HI> next coming, or within fifteen days after; and so from year to year, till all the foresaid sum of 56,000 marks shall be fully paid, as hath been already said; and afterwards the King, and all the other Lords of <HI>Scotland,</HI> who stand engaged for the payment of the said remainder, their heirs and successors, shall remain acquitted and discharged by the said King of <HI>England,</HI> his heirs and successors, and assigns, of all the said ransom, and all other sums, penalties, failures, oaths, obligations covenants promises and defaults, if any chance to be alledged: And of all demands, which may be made by vertue of any obligations by indentures and public instruments, granted and passed to the said King of <HI>England,</HI> since the time that the said King of <HI>Scotland</HI> was taken prisoner at the battle of <HI>Durham.</HI></P>
<P>And, in particular, of the last obligation by the said King of <HI>Scotland,</HI> given for the pay∣ment of 100,000l.

<P>It is in like manner stipulated by the Commissioners of the King of <HI>England,</HI> that the sub∣jects of the King of <HI>Scotland</HI> shall have, during the said truce, one moiety of the rents and profits of the lands and possessions in the hands of those people, who are under the subjection and obedience of the King of <HI>England</HI> in the county of <HI>Roxburgh;</HI> that is, in such manner that those of <HI>Scotland,</HI> claiming right of inheritance in the said lands and possessions, may enjoy one moiety of the profits; but that all the time of the said truce, the said lands and possessions, to∣gether with the persons, in whose hands they are, shall remain, as to the King of <HI>England,</HI> in the same state, fealty, obedience, and condition, they are in this present day.</P>
<P>And the said lands shall, during the term of the said truce, be farmed out well and faithfully, by the joint consent of both parties concerned, to as much advantage as may be, without any fraud or deceit.</P>

London only three days before he set forward for Berwick; before which place he came on the 14th day of January with a large army, attended by a great naval power, with which he laid siege to the town both by sea and land. The King entered the castle, which still held out for him, and meditated a sally at the time his troops began the

assault on other quarters: <HI>Sir Walter Manny,</HI> with miners brought from the forest of Dean, was employed at the same time, in advancing a mine below the wall. These vigorous measures induced the garrison to surrender the town. Some of the Scotch Historians say, the garrison on the approach of King Edward's army evacuated the place, having

first plundered it and beat down the walls. The King added greatly to the fortifications, and strengthened the fortress with several new works. The surprize of Berwick by the Scotch, is spoken of with some incredible circumstances: <HI>Steward Earl of Angus,</HI> with <HI>Earl March,</HI> having collected a powerful navy, from different parts of Scotland, in which they embarked a chosen band of soldiers, entered Tweed in a dark night, and landed the forces under the walls unperceived: by break of day, with scaling ladders, they mounted the wall at Cowgate, and overpowered the guard; after which they soon made themselves masters of the whole town. It seems probable there was some treachery in favour of the Scotch assailants.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Patric of Dunbar Counte of Marche, and Thomas le Seneschal, that caulled hymself Counte of Angus, one and twenty days after thys prepaired themself apon a nighte with scaling laders cumming to Berwick, and with yn VI dayes after tok be assaute one of the stronges toures of Berwik, and enterid the town.</P>

<P><PB N="78" REF="81"/><HI>Berwick Castle</HI> afterwards had many changes of possessors. In the year 1377, seven intrepid and valiant Scots made themselves masters of it in the night, killed the Governor, <HI>Sir Robert Boynton,</HI> and gave li∣berty to his Lady under a ransom of 2000 marks. But these heroes did not long possess their honourable acquisition, for the <HI>Earls of Nor∣thumberland</HI> and <HI>Nottingham,</HI> and the <HI>Lords Lucy, Neville,</HI> and <HI>Stafford,</HI> with several other English Nobles, soon after invested the place, took the fortress by storm, and put the Scots to the sword, who were in∣creased to the number of 48: but this was not effected till the small garrison had held out eight days against 7000 English archers and 3000 horse, and during the assault lost only two of their number. The Nor∣thumbrians soon after ravaged the territories of Lord March, in revenge for his destroying the town of Roxburgh. The above-mentioned sur∣prize was effected in the night before the feast of St. Andrew. The leader, some authors say, was the valiant <HI>Sir John Gordon,</HI> but the English Historians alledge it was <HI>Alexander Ramsey.</HI> When the <HI>Earl of Northumberland</HI> summoned them to surrender, they answered with in∣solence, <Q>that they would not yield it either to the King of England or Scotland, but would retain and defend it for the King of France.</Q></P>
<P>In 1384, the Scotch gained Berwick, by corrupting the Deputy Go∣vernor. The <HI>Duke of Lancaster,</HI> then in enmity with <HI>Henry Percy</HI> Earl of Northumberland, possessing the King's ear, improved this circum∣stance greatly to the Earl's disadvantage, and he was in consequence attainted of high treason, as having been guilty of treachery; and con∣sequently his possessions were forfeited. The Earl thinking his imme∣diate presence before Berwick was of the first consequence, with a nu∣merous army besieged the town; but bloodshed was spared by the se∣cret application of 2000 marks, which regained the place. This event operated so powerfully as to gain the King's pardon, and restitution to the Earl of his possessions and honours.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A.

<P>A conspiracy and insurrection were formed in the year 1405, against King Henry IV, in which the <HI>Earl of Northumberland,</HI> the <HI>Arch∣bishop of York, Thomas Mowbray,</HI> son of the then Duke of Norfolk He∣reditary Earl Marsh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l, <HI>Lord Bardolph,</HI> and others, were the leaders.
<PB N="79" REF="82"/>
The <HI>Earl of Northumberland</HI> could not brook the indignities his Sove∣reign had heaped upon him; for beside the grief he sustained in the loss of his son who fell at the battle of <HI>Shrewsbury,</HI> and the execution of his brother, he had the mortification to see the King's third son John, as∣sume the office of High Constable, which the King had conferred on the Earl for life, with the Wardenship of the East Marches; he also was deprived of the office of Warden of the West Marches, in favour of the <HI>Earl of Westmoreland.</HI> The King demanded the resig∣nation of the castles of <HI>Berwick</HI> and <HI>Jedburgh,</HI> and in contempt of the general act of grace for the remission of all offences, passed after the battle of <HI>Shrewsbury,</HI> sent out commissioners to compound with the Earl's adherents, and grant them separate charters. The Archbishop, and Earl Marshal were apprehended, before the Earl of Northumber∣land could join them with his forces, and suffered execution at York. <HI>The Earl of Northumberland</HI> held the castle of <HI>Berwick.</HI> On the King's arrival at Pontefract, he ordered a confiscation of all the Earl's estates, and commanded the Sheriff of Yorkshire, to summon the whole military power of his county, to rendezvous at Newcastle. The force with which the King proceeded on this expedition, was no less than 37,000 men, with engines and artillery for a siege. This powerful ar∣mament alarming the Earl, with his grandson, the son of <HI>Henry Hot∣spur,</HI> and <HI>Bardolph,</HI> he retired privily from Berwick, and took refuge in Scotland. <HI>Sir William Greystock</HI> was left to command the fortress. King Henry on his march summoned the castle of <HI>Warkworth</HI> to sur∣render, but it was not yielded to him, till after a siege of eight days, when the garrison capitulated on the honourable terms of departing with their horses and accoutrements. He made the like summons to the garrison of the castle of <HI>Alnwick,</HI> to which he received for answer,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hard. p. 203.</NOTE> "That wynne <HI>Berwick,</HI> ones, he should have his entent." The army advanced to <HI>Berwick,</HI> and made the usual preparations for a regular siege, whilst the Governor on his part pursued the necessary manoeuvres, for a vigorous defence, in hopes of receiving succour from Scotland, which had been promised him by the Earl on his departure. The royal army had some pieces of ordnance, engines of destruction which had never before appeared against the fortifications of <HI>Berwick;</HI> and which Speed, by the authority of Walsingham, says, were on this occasion, for the first time, employed in Britain. A shot of an enormous size,

discharged from a cannon of large bore,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The first construction of Cannon, was by iron bars bound together with hoops.</NOTE> shattered one of the principal towers, which threw the garrison into such consternation, that they im∣mediately surrendered. The Governor, <HI>Sir Henry Bolton,</HI> and <HI>Blenkinsop</HI> suffered instant decapitation; and the remaining part of the garrison were committed close prisoners.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P>A.

<P>On the demise of King Henry V. in France, and the accession of his infant son, the Scots, in the year 1422, invaded England. The Go∣vernor of Scotland with one army invested <HI>Berwick,</HI> whilst <HI>Earl Douglas</HI> with another laid siege to <HI>Roxburgh;</HI> but neither of these attempts were attended with success.</P>
<P>In Leland's Collectanea <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Lel. Col. v. 1. p. 499.</NOTE> are the following notes: <Q>Edward Erle of March, because King Henry had broken convenauntes, was made King at Westminster Anno D. 1459.</Q></P>

<P>Upon a rupture with Scotland in the year 1480, the English in the winter laid siege to <HI>Berwick,</HI> by sea and land, with a great force. Part
<PB N="81" REF="84"/>
of the fortifications were then new, the same having been constructed by King James III. of Scotland, after the surrender above mentioned, who had expended a large sum in strengthening and rebuilding the walls of the town, repairing the castle, and furnishing it with a compleat arrangement of artillery. The assailants flattered themselves, from the newness of the works, they should be able to beat them down without much difficulty, and easily win the place; but although considerable breaches were effected, the garrison made so brave a defence, that after spending a great part of the winter in carrying on the siege, the English were obliged to raise it, and retire with disgrace.</P>
<P>King Edward IV. in the year 1482, about the beginning of July marshalled his army at <HI>Alnwick,</HI> amounting to 22,000 men, the van of which was led by <HI>Henry Earl of Northumberland.</HI> So great a force appearing unexpectedly on the banks of Tweed opposite to <HI>Berwick,</HI> the town made no resistance, and was immediately seized by the Eng∣lish. <HI>Lord Hales,</HI> who commanded the <HI>castle,</HI> having answered that he was determined not to surrender it, 4000 men under the command of <HI>Lord Stanley, Sir John Elrington, and Sir William Parr,</HI> were left to be∣siege it, whilst the main army marched into Scotland.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Stowe, p. 432.</NOTE> The great con∣fusion which shortly after took place in the Scottish state, it is said, was <HI>Lord Hales</HI>'s sole motive for surrendering the <HI>castle</HI> on the 24th day of the succeeding August, he having no hope of succours. On the suc∣ceeding truce <HI>Berwick</HI> was given up to England, and the Scots engaged never again to attempt by any art the reduction of it. Since which time it has constantly remained in the possession of the Crown of England.</P>
<P>In the reigns of King Richard III. and King James III. of Scotland, Commissioners were appointed by the two Crowns, to set the limits of <HI>Berwick;</HI> on which occasion the disputed ground was agreed to re∣main uncultivated, unbuilt, and uninhabited.</P>
<P>In the treaty and convention entered into by King Henry VII. and James IV. King of Scotland, A. D. 1502, it was stipulated, that the <HI>town</HI> and <HI>castle</HI> of <HI>Berwick,</HI> with their ancient bounds and the inhabi∣tants thereof, should for ever remain and be included in the present perpetual peace, friendship, league, and confederacy: so that neither the King of Scotland, his heirs and successors, nor any of them, should

by themselves, or any of their subjects, lieges, or vassals, make or suffer to be made war, insult, ambush, or siege, publicly or privately, against the places themselves or their inhabitants; nor the King of England, his heirs, successors, or any of them, should by themselves or the in∣habitants of the town and castle, make any war insult or siege on the King of Scotland or his vassals.</P>
<P>In the month of January, A. D. 1502, James IV. King of Scotland, espoused Margaret eldest daughter of King Henry VII. In Leland's Collectanea is a record, stiled <Q>The Fyancelles of Margaret eldest daughter of King Henry VII. to James King of Scotland: Together with her departure from England, journey into Scotland, her recep∣tion and marriaged there, and the great feasts held on that account.

<P>On the 10th day of October A. D. 1525, a treaty was concluded at <HI>Berwick,</HI> between the Commissioners of King Henry VIII. and King James V. for a three-years peace; and in the year 1528, the truce was renewed, and the peace continued for five years.</P>
<P>In the year 1547, King Henry VIII. being dead, leaving his son Edward VI. an infant of ten years of age, the <HI>Earl of Hertford,</HI> then created <HI>Duke of Somerset,</HI> in the month of August, advanced to <HI>Ber∣wick</HI> with an army of 18,000 men, attended by a fleet of 34 ships of war, 30 transports and a galley, on an expedition to Scotland.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See an account of the devastations made on this expedition, p. 37.</NOTE> The army lay encamped without the walls of the town.</P>
<P>In the year 1550, great repairs were made in the fortress of <HI>Berwick,</HI> the expence of which, with the repairs of Calais, are alledged in the King's Journals as the reason for debasing the coin; from thence it also appears, some of the walls had fallen, the foundations having been shaken by working a bulwark. Also in the year 1552, it appears con∣siderable improvements had been made to the fortifications, in which, by the minutes of Secretary Cecil,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Hayne, p. 127.</NOTE> 6000l. had been expended. The fort then erected was contrived to have four bulwarks, for erecting which the wall was to have been left open, on the enemy's side, for a considerable space; but as this was dangerous and expensive, it was resolved the wall should be strengthened by an additional wall, and two slaughter-houses, to scour the outer cu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ains, and a great ditch intervening, that an other wall fortified in the same manner should be erected within the former. <HI>Sir Nicholas Sturley</HI> appears to have been nominated Captain of this new fort, <HI>Alexander Brett,</HI> Porter, and one <HI>Rokesby,</HI> Marshal. No vestiges of these works now appearing, it is to be presumed they were rased, when Queen Elizabeth put the fortifica∣tions upon a regular and modern plan.</P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="91"/>In the reigns of King Edward VI. and Queen Mary of Scotland, <HI>Berwick</HI> by treaty was made <HI>a county town,</HI> and as Rymer's Faedra notes it, "a free town independant of both states."</P>
<P>In the year 1558, <HI>Lord Wharton</HI> in his reports to the Lord President of the North, says, the ordinary officers of the town appointed by let∣ters patent, were, a Captain, a Marshal, a Treasurer, a Chamberlain, a Porter, and a Master of the Ordnance: These with the Mayor for the year, were counsellors for the town, each having a yearly salary, and pay for attendants.</P>
<P>In the year 1566, Queen Mary of Scotland came into the neighbour∣hood to view <HI>Berwick;</HI> she was met at the extreme of the liberties by the Deputy Governor and his train, who conducted her first to <HI>Hallidon Hill,</HI> and thence to the west of the town, where she had a perfect view of the place, and was saluted by a general discharge of the ordnance.</P>
<P>In 1588, King James VI. of Scotland did the like, and received the same salute.</P>
<P>Queen Elizabeth having fortified <HI>Berwick,</HI> made the following mili∣tary establishment there, in the year 1576, as appears by the archieves of the borough.</P>
<P>The garrison consisted of eight companies of musqueteers, two of them containing 100, and the rest 65 men each; the pay of the private men 8d. per day, Captains of larger companies 4s. of lesser companies 2s. 80 horsemen under command of eight constables: the horsemen had 4d. per day added to their former pay of 6l. 13s. 4d. per annum. The gunners were augmented, on account of the great additional num∣ber of large ordnance, from 28 to 60, with a Master Gunner, a Mate, and four Quarter Masters: the whole establishment for the artillery amounting to about 860l.</P>

<P><HI>Lord Hunsdon</HI> was Governor of <HI>Berwick</HI> at the time of this establish∣ment; his council was composed of <HI>Sir Robert Constable, Knight,</HI> High Marshal; <HI>Robert Bowes, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR></HI> Treasurer; <HI>John Selbie, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR></HI> Chief Porter; <HI>Sir Francis Russel, Knight,</HI> Chamberlain; and <HI>Thomas Sutton, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR></HI> Mas∣ter of the Ordnance. The Mayor had an appointment of 10l. per ann. the Customer 10l. and the Comptroller of the Customs 5l.</P>
<P>The Master of the Ordnance had under his charge more than 20 ar∣tificers employed for service of the garrison: among these was one <HI>Bowyer,</HI> one <HI>Fletcheur</HI> or arrow-maker, and one <HI>Master Wheeler.</HI></P>
<P>The whole number of men on this establishment, was 980, and their pay amounted to the yearly sum of 12734l. 19s. 2d.</P>
<P>In the year 1603, on the demise of Queen Elizabeth, King James VI. of Scotland, was proclaimed March 26th, at this place, King of Eng∣land, France, and Ireland, by the name of King James I. In the archieves of Berwick, is kept a copy of the letter wrote by the Mayor,
<PB N="90" REF="93"/>
Aldermen, and Commons, dated on the above day, informing the King, <Q>they had, with present expedition, and with what solemnity the leisure of time would afford, published and proclaimed his sacred Majesty King of England, France, and Ireland; and entreats him to pardon such defects as by ignorance, omission, or otherwise, by the straitness of time, had happened in the performance thereof.</Q> To which the King returned the following answer.</P>
<P><Q>To our trusty friends, the Mayor and Aldermen of the town of Berwick.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Trusty friends, wee greet you heartily well. We render you thanks for your so dutyfull affection, utterit in assisting and concur∣ring sae willingly with your Governour, in putting the town of Ber∣wick in our hands, which we have appointit to be governed in the same form and manner as heretofore, while we advise otherwise to dispose upon the same; assuring you always to find us a gratious and loving Prince, wha sal be careful to maintaine your wonted liberties and privileges, and to see that the same be nae ways braugillit, nor otherwaies prejudget. Sua we commit you to God. From Hal∣lirude house this 27th day of March 1603.</Q></P>
<P>On the King's arrival at the boundary of the liberties of <HI>Berwick,</HI> he was received with every demonstration of duty and welcome, by <HI>Sir John Carey,</HI> then Marshal, accompanied by the officers of the garrison: their several corps of horse and foot were marshalled in due order, and on the King's passing saluted him with a <HI>feu de joy,</HI> which was return∣ed by a discharge of the artillery on the ramparts. The roads were lined with people, who on all sides joined in the loudest acclamations.</P>
<P>When his Majesty entered the gate, the keys of the town were deli∣vered to him, by <HI>William Selby,</HI> Gentleman Porter; who was immedi∣ately knighted, and the keys were returned. In the market-place, he was met by the body corporate of the borough; <HI>Hugh Gregson,</HI> the Mayor, presented him with an offering of gold, and surrender of their charter; after which the Recorder made a speech of congratulation: these the King received most graciously, at the same time restoring the charter, and promising his royal favour and protection. The King proceeded to the church to return thanks for his peaceful entry into his new dominions, when <HI>Toby Mathews, Bishop of Durham,</HI> preached an
<PB N="91" REF="94"/>
excellent sermon. From thence his Majesty went to the <HI>castle,</HI> the ordnance were again discharged, and the streets re-echoed with accla∣mations of joy. On the following day the King received several of the English Nobles, among whom were <HI>Lord Cobham,</HI> and <HI>Henry Howard,</HI> brother of the Duke of Norfolk, who came to Berwick to pay their duty to their new Sovereign: his Majesty inspected the fortifications, magazines, and port, and at the head of the garrison drawn out and under arms, with his own hands, discharged a piece of ordnance.</P>
<P><HI>Berwick</HI> became the ducal title of <HI>James Fitz James,</HI> natural son of King James II. of England, whom he created Duke of Berwick, A. D. 1686.</P>
<P><HI>Berwick</HI> is a borough of very great antiquity, being as before assert∣ed one of the four original Scotch burghs;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The town arms, a dog passant by a tree, in fesse point, two escutcheons with the arms of England and France quarterly, tied together by an arch; in chief a King sitting on an arch,' with a scepter in the right hand, and a mound in his left.—Browne Willis.</NOTE> the corporation was pre∣scriptive, but after this place became the settled possession of the English Crown, the corporate body was established by charter; and at present consists of a Mayor, Recorder, and four Bailiffs, chosen annually by the burgesses. This borough was summoned to send two members to parliament in the reign of King Henry VIII. the election of representa∣tives is by the burgesses, the Mayor and Bailiffs making the return.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P>Representatives in Parliament for the Town of Berwick.</P>
<P>Brown Willis says, that the burgesses were summoned to send representatives to parliament, in the latter end of the reign of King Edward IV. From the 17th of King Edward IV. to the First of King Edward VI. the returns are all lost, except an imperfect bundle of the 33d of King Edward VIII.</P>

<P>The public Grammar School of Berwick upon Tweed, being vacant by the resignation of the late master, the Guild has determined to fill the employment, by the most deserving man they can find to undertake the charge.</P>
<P>Notice is hereby given, that the said employment will be disposed of on Thursday the 27th of December next, at Berwick, where the candidates are desired at that day, to make their personal appearance.</P>
<P>The corporation being duly sensible of the high importance of the charge, and how much the principles of the society may be corrupted, their morals debauched, and the public peace disturbed, by the jacobitism, bigotry, loose morals, imprudence, or ill temper of the person that is intrusted with their children, at an age susceptible of every impression, desire that who∣ever is willing to offer themselves as candidates for such employment, may, on or before the 27th of November, send certificates sealed up and enclosed, to the Town Clerk of Berwick, under the hands of gentlemen of probity and knowledge, of their zeal for liberty and the pre∣sent constitution, their sobriety, moderation, good conduct and temper, as the corporation is resolved to commit that care to the person who shall appear best qualified: and therefore after the attention to their characters in these respects, gentlemen of undoubted honour will be em∣ployed to examine into the learning of the persons best recommended.</P>
<P>The master has a commodious dwelling-house and garden; the salary for teaching freemen's children is 60l. per annum, and 10s. a quarter for teaching every unfreeman's child; out of which the master is to provide himself with an usher, at a yearly salary not less than 20l. who is to be approved by the Guild.</P></NOTE></P>
<P>The chief <HI>imports</HI> of the <HI>port of Berwick</HI> are from Norway and the Baltic, consisting of timber and deals: the <HI>exports,</HI> corn, wool, salmon, and eggs; the latter of which articles, though apparently small or in∣significant in the list, yet brings in an annual sum of 13 or 14,000l. they being sent to London for the use of sugar refiners, &amp;c. packed in boxes the thick end down.</P>
<P>The salmon fishery here is very considerable. Mr Pennant speaks of it in the following terms: <Q>They lay on each side the river, and are all private property, except what belongs to the Dean and Chapter of Durham, which in rent and tithe of fish, brings in 450l. per annum: for all the other fisheries are liable to tithe. The common rents of these are 50l. a year, for which tenants have as much shore, as serves to launch out and draw their nets on shore; the limits of each are staked, and I observed that the fishers never failed going as near as possible to their neighbour's limits. One man goes off in a small flat-bottomed
<PB N="98" REF="101"/>
boat, square at one end; and taking as large a circuit as his net admits, brings it on shore at the extremity of his boundary, where others assist in landing it. The best fishery is on the south side; very fine salmon trout are often taken here, which come up from the sea to spawn, and return in the same manner as the salmon do. For a fuller account of this fishery, vide British Zoology III. 241. To it may also be added, that in the middle of the river, not a mile west of the town, is a large stone, on which a man is placed, to observe what is called the <HI>Reck</HI> of the salmon coming up.</Q></P>
<P>Historians have differed greatly in the etymology of the name of <HI>Berwick.</HI> Camden seems to determine in favour of the Saxon <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, the town of <HI>the Bernicians.</HI></P>
<P>After having mentioned the evidences of antiquity, it is requisite, before I quit the subject, I should speak of <HI>Berwick</HI> in its natural state. Being built on an angular point of land, at the mouth of Tweed, on two sides it is bounded by water: the sea in this part of the channel is tempestuous and rough, the tide setting in very strong, occasions a heavy surge, which increased by frequent storms, renders the coast tre∣mendous. The prospect of the ocean conveys to the contemplative mind, a grand association of images, which describe the might and majesty of the Creator. As I walked the banks, imagination roved at large, but took a melancholy strain; I conceived I heard the alarm guns fired at Bambrough Castle, and the signal of distress waved in my Fancy's eye, from some vessel at a distance. The ocean, which before had affected my soul with a scene of magnificent delight, now seemed full of horror and dismay; the rolling billows became tremendous, the yawning gulph an object of gloomy terror, the whole conveyed the apprehension of imminent peril and distress; and in the end, all the agonies of a distracted crew, who laboured for life, filled my imagina∣tion, and the wanderings of Fancy were replete with dismay and misery.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of <HI>Berwick</HI> have enough of such horrid scenes: the coast is terrible to mariners. After having once been witness to so me∣lancholy an event, one would scarce ever look upon the sea again with pleasure.</P>
<P><HI>The Land Prospect</HI> doth not produce a scene wild enough to be called romantic, or sufficiently cultivated, to be smooth, placid, and agreeable.
<PB N="99" REF="102"/>
The banks of Tweed loss much of their sweetness in the environs of the town; and Flora reserves most of her beauties for the neighbourhood of <HI>Kelso</HI> and <HI>Coldstream.</HI> Below Berwick bridge, there is not enough either of trade or tranquillity; it possesses the middle station; neither busy enough nor enough at rest, is dulness. Above bridge, in the fishing season, the scene is beautifully enlivened. Below, some few vessels are moored, but too often the heavy hulks are turned up on the dry sands, with masts unrigged, waiting for trade and tide. Such are dull objects to the eye, and have no other effect upon the spectator than to promote weariness and impatiency.</P>
<P>Over the arm of the sea which breaks upon the bar of Tweed, the lands to the southward are extended for several miles upon the view, varied with the happy colourings which succeed to cultivation; but the distance is so great, that objects are indistinct, and the beauties of the landskip lay in confusion: two often indeed the whole is enveloped in sea vapour.</P>
<P>I cannot take my departure from the banks of Tweed, without passing some few thoughts on the carnage and bloodshed, which for ages ren∣dered them famous to the arms of both the Scotch and English; and to posterity made their history a subject of horror and detestation.</P>
<P>Alberic Bishop of Ostia, being sent as Legate from Pope Innocent II. on his visitation at Carlisle, is said to have taken great pains to remon∣strate to the army of King David of Scotland, after the retreat from the battle of Alerton, that they ought to wage war with greater humanity; and prevailed with them so far as to gain the release of the female cap∣tives, whom they were carrying as slaves into Scotland. He also ob∣tained their solemn engagement, that in future inroads they would not violate the churches and religious houses; and would also spare from the sword, women, infants, and the aged. These shew to us what were the infamous enormities committed in these expeditions.</P>
<P>The war carried on between the two nations, was as brutal as any in the annals of the Caribbees, or any savages under the sun. The pub∣lic injuries of states, the policy of empires, the balance of trade, the peace of Europe, or the equilibrium of power, were not the objects of warfare: like the wild Arabs, the estate of the people was that of rob∣bers, rapine and plunder their objects; as if devoid of all religious sense
<PB N="100" REF="103"/>
of oaths and moral obligations, the compacts of states, and the ties of honour and moral honesty, they often forsook every principle for plun∣der, and like barbarians, levied war for the sake of pillaging, of re∣prisal, and retribution. When the wolves descend the Alps upon the villages, it is the effect of hunger in its extreme; but here the blood of the peasant was shed without any cogency of cause, but the lucre of his herds, flocks, and possessions. The immortal <HI>King John</HI> burnt, laid waste, and destroyed half the island, from York northward: Alexander in all his glory never exhibited a more noble conflagration. Edward contaminated his honours with many of those atchievements. Torrents of blood have issued from these borders; they were the common char∣nel of the two nations. Thirty-three thousand souls fled in one day to the gates of eternity, dispatched by the command of Princes, who could not account to heaven what it was they fought for. The petit massacres were equally as inconsiderate; the heroes of those bands walked forth with their adherents, imbruing their hands in human gore, burning and destroying, laying waste towers, towns and villages, and spreading deso∣lation, in the most savage manner, for the reward of savages: reciprocal slaughters, devastations, and cruelties marked both people. When the most valiant atchievements were performed, even in the presence of their Princes, revenge appeared to be the only instigation, and common justice was seldom considered. What was the battle of Allerton, in the reign of Stephen, when David with a mighty slaughter was overthrown, after having ravaged Northumberland and Durham, returning like a dis∣appointed miscreant, with his hands red in the blood of thousands of his band of robbers! William King of Scotland was a prisoner on one of his incursions: he witnessed a cruel slaughter of his people. Our Edward I. slew 60,000 at Falkirk; Edward III. slew his tens of thousands at Hally-down Hill; and Penrith and Durham witnessed to the succeeding de∣struction made of the Scots in this reign under their unfortunate David, who in the battle at the last-mentioned place was made prisoner. The battles of Otterburn and Flodden Field were upon the same principles as the others.—How doth this retrospection fully the hero, stain the lustre of his arms, and the honour of his valour! yet it is too true such were the conflicts on the borders, and such the arms that waged the inglorious warfare on this once wretched, but now most happy coun∣try; at this time abounding with wealth, flowing from peace, by the channels of cultivation, manufactory, and trade: where the brethren of one climate and one island, under the blessed protection of one com∣mon father, and a constitution admired and envied by all the world,
<PB N="101" REF="104"/>
are acting together in a state of mutual offices, to contribute to the general opulence and felicity.</P>
<P>How baneful and obnoxious is he to the common interests of this now united family, who attempts to sow the seeds of dissatisfaction and jealousy, and through calumnies arising in the venom of malevo∣lence and disappointed ambition endeavours to cultivate contempt and aversion between the brethren of this land! The strength of this, and every nation, is the union of its inhabitants—he who blows up the embers of extinguished feuds, is particularly an enemy to both parties, and a foe to the state at large.</P>
<P>The accession of King James the VI. to the Crown of England, ope∣rated powerfully towards the felicity of this part of the island; cultiva∣tion immediately took place, the country so often desolated by war, received new inhabitants, who brought with them not only flocks and herds, but also manufactories and commerce: the works effected in peace were soon distinguished, the barren wastes were put under the plough share, towns and hamlets diversified the scene, and increasing population enlivened every valley, which for ages had been marked by works of hostility. Yet it was not till the union of the two kingdoms, that these effects of peace were brought to the happy eminence now discovered on every hand. As to political advantages, it is evident, their discussion comes not within my plan in this work; I am per∣suaded of their vast importance to both nations: Mrs Macauley says, <Q>on very sound principles of policy, the union had been several times rejected by both nations; and which was with great difficulty coerced on the Scots: though as Burnet observes, the advantages which were offered to Scotland, in the whole frame of it, were great and visible. The Scots were to bear less than the fortieth part of the public taxes, and they were to have the eleventh part of the legisla∣ture. Trade was to be free all over the island, and to the plantations; private rights were to be preserved; and the judicature and laws of Scotland were still to be continued.</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><HI>Lord Marchmont</HI> having been pointed at by Historians as being one of those corrupt par∣tizans, who effected the <HI>union</HI> from sinister views, the following <HI>authentic letter</HI> in the <HI>author</HI>'s custody, among many state papers found in the cabinet of the late <HI>Lord Wharton,</HI> will be thought worthy a place here: To which some historical notes, &amp;c. are added.</P>

<P>I had the honour of your Lordship's letter of the 31st July last, by the Lord Ross, who did me the kindness to call at my house, on his way to Edinburgh, and gave me the satisfactory account of your Lordship's hearty inclinations to the union, and of your prudent diligence to advance it in the treaty: such as I would have expected from your understanding and parts.</P>

<P>I would have written to your Lordship sooner, but delayed till I might observe the motions of our parliament.

<P>From this letter the reader must entertain a more favourable idea of its author.</P></NOTE> but especially that it would overturn the church government established here, which the people are so addicted to, that they can suffer as much for it, as I think they would for Christianity itself.</P>
<P>Some had influenced the most part of our preachers, to whom the people have great regard, that it is scarcely possible to persuade them to a true notion of the union, or to any good thoughts of it, though there has been much pains taken by others to do it.</P>
<P>When the parliament met, it was easy to find out who had been the somenters of the fears and doubts causing the aversion; and it is evident enough the opposers in parliament have been the authors of very bad impressions upon the clergy and lower people,<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><P>Mr Fleming's Voyage to Scotland, printed with Hook's Negotiation, says, <Q>The same evening I arrived at Lord Nai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ns, in the county of Perth, who expressed great zeal for the service of the K—; and as I had a letter of the Earl of Errol for him, that he might inform me of the most proper measures to see his brother the Mar∣quis of Athol, he undertook to conduct me to him.

<PB N="102" REF="105"/></NOTE> yet I am of opinion, that the fancies they have taken up will soon vanish, and will not be the hinderance of con∣cluding a treaty.</P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="104"/>Upon the 4th current the house came to a question, <Q>Approve the first article of the treaty or not?</Q>—With this provision, that if other articles be not adjusted by the parliament, the agreeing to the first should be of no effect.</P>
<P>The voters present were 199, of which 116 were approvers, 83 were opposers; of these 66 entered their dissent and protested—17 would not join in the dissent, because they differed from the approvers, only in that they were not for putting a question upon the first article, till votes should pass on the 4th, 5th, and some other following articles: and I think, the most part of, if not all the 17, are for an entire union, if the terms please them.</P>
<P>Several very understanding and well affected members find difficulties in some of the articles, whereof they apprehend some to be insuperable, unless they meet with a remedy from the wisdom of England.</P>
<P>Many of the more judicious members are little moved by the cross humour raised among the people, by the pains of ill-designing men, while it is founded only upon speculation, for they think that will vanish. But if the mulitude of the lower people, shall at the beginning feel a sensible prejudice by the execution of any article, then the danger may prove greater among a hot stubborn vulgar, than can well be foreseen.</P>
<P>I cannot yet condescend upon particulars, which I will do when I am able to explain them more distinctly: this I can say in the general, that I am only apprehensive of such things as may universally affect the common people, before they can have much relish of the advantages which certainly will in course be the product and fruit of an union.</P>
<P>In the beginning of this session, those who in the last were called the new party, made up of the Peers and Gentlemen who were laid aside from public employment and the council in the year 1705, and others their friends upon whom they have influence, who have still stuck toge∣ther, above 24 in number, were suspected that they would go cross to the Ministers: but God
<PB N="104" REF="107"/>be thanked they have not done so, for which they merit esteem and thanks from all who wish well to her Majesty and her kingdoms. They have carried themselves and concurred as persons of honour and understanding, for promoting the common good, without any appearance of resentment towards those now employed. Whereas if they had joined with the opposers of the union, the promoters of it here were not able to carry it through.</P>
<P>As for the <HI>protesters,</HI> I am confident, the far greater part, if not all of them, are designing to make way for the ST GERMAINS YOUTH, and to divide these kingdoms.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Voltaire speaking of the Tories attempting to replace the Stuart family on the throne of England, is thus noted by his translator Smollet: <Q>We can affirm, on the very best authority, that the Tories never harboured any such design: there might indeed be some Jacobites among them, who secretly entertained notions of that kind, but these they carefully concealed from the party with which they associated. Some too were driven into Jacobitism by hard usage; but the Tories in general had no intention to alter that succession which they them∣selves had established.</Q></NOTE> They well discern that an union extinguishes all hopes of that sort; and therefore they will certainly em∣brace any means that can prevent an union. But as the friends to it cannot miss to out-vote the other, if insuperable difficulties of the kind I have mentioned be not found in some of the articles; or if found, be removed or redressed by the prudent assistance of your Lordship, and such as you in your parliament; I doubt not the treaty will be brought to a happy conclusion, which I heartily wish, and wherein I shall labour to be as much assistant here as can be in the power of,</P>

<P>The difficulties and warm debates which happened in the house, led me to delay the sending my letter, till I could give you this further account.</P>
<P>The 2d, 3d, and 4th articles of the treaty are approved, with the like provision as the first is; but the carrying of these votes was with a great deal of wrangle and contest: even as much upon the 4th (wherein we expected little resistance) as upon any of the former; whereby it is easy to discern the design of the opposers. Yet our greater difficulty is to keep many by whom we must carry our votes, from being misled by the designing opposers, with the subtle pretences they make; so plausible, as are of danger to prevail upon the less understanding sort of well-meaning persons.</P>
<P>The 5th article is this day approved, with this alteration. <Q>The Diet is changed from the time of signing the treaty for the union, to the time of ratifying the treaty.</Q></P>
<P>"I know not how your parliament may like this, but I am hopeful that an affair of so ma∣nifold advantages to this island, as an entire union may prove, will not stop upon differences of lesser moment.</P>
<P>What I foresee of this sort, brings to my remembrance a very old treaty betwixt Reheboam and the tribes of Israel; and of the wise advice which the old Counsellors gave him. This similitude halts, as commonly all do; yet I believe your Lordship will find something in it that may be of use.</P>

</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>HOLY ISLAND;</HEAD>
<P>the morning was calm, the sea smooth, and the land prospect gilded with the sun; very beautiful, though not much variegated.</P>
<P>The description given of this island (Symeon, p. 87) is to the follow∣ing purport: <Q>That in circumference it comprehends eight miles, in which was a noble <HI>Monastery,</HI> famous for its Prelates, (among whom was <HI>St. Cuthbert</HI>) whose bodies were there deposited, and whose me∣mory would live for ever. It hath the name of <HI>Lindisfarn,</HI> from a small rivulet called <HI>Lindis,</HI> which from the opposite continent empties itself into the sea."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>In Mr Grose's works we find these particulars relative to this Island.</P>
<P><Q>Bede calls it a Semi Island, being as he justly observes, twice an island and twice continent in one day; for at the flowing of the tide it is encompassed by water, and at the ebb there is an almost dry passage, both for horses and carriages to and from the main land; from which if measured in a straight line it is distant about two miles eastward; but on account of some quick sands passengers are obliged to make so many detours, that the length of the way is nearly doubled, the water over these flats at spring tides is only seven feet.</Q></P>
<P><Q>This island was by the Britons called <HI>Inis Medicante;</HI> also <HI>Lindisfarn</HI> from the small rivulet of <HI>Lindi</HI> which here runs into the sea, and the Celtic word <HI>Fahren</HI> or recess; also on account of its being the habitation of some of the first monks in this country, it afterwards obtained its present name of <HI>Holy Island.</HI> It measures from east to west about two miles and a quarter, and its breadth from north to south is scarcely a mile and a half. At the north-west part there runs out a spit of land of about a mile in length. The <HI>Monastery</HI> is situated at the southermost extremity; and a small distance north of it stands the little town inhabited chiefly by fishermen. This island though really part of <HI>Northumberland</HI> belongs to <HI>Durham;</HI> and all civil disputes must be determined by the justices of that county.</Q></P></NOTE> By Bede it is described, "Qui locus accedente ac recedente reumate, bis quotidiae instar insulae maris circumluitur undis, bis, renudato littore contiguus terrae redditur.</Q><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Lindis dicitur flumen, quod in mare excurrit, duorum pedum latitudinem habens, quando Ledon fuerit, id est, minor aestus, &amp; videri potest.

<P><PB N="106" REF="109"/>There is one small farm of cultivated land upon the island, with some few acres of good pasture ground, capable of improvement; and the rest, by the violence of tempests, is covered with sand. The island chiefly consists of one continued plain, inclining to the south-west. The land on which the village stands, rises swiftly from the shore; at the southern point, is a rock of a conical figure, and almost perpendicular, near 60 feet in height, having on its lofty crown a small fortress or castle, which makes at once a grotesque and formidable appearance. I did not observe one tree upon the island.</P>
<P><FIGURE>
<HEAD>HOLY ISLAND</HEAD>
<FIGDESC>depiction of Holy Island</FIGDESC>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>The village consists of a few scattered houses, two of which are Inns, the rest chiefly inhabited by fishermen. The shore is excellent for bathing, and the situation at once healthy and romantic: it is surprising it should be so little resorted to. The north and east coasts of the island are formed of perpendicular rocks, the other sides sink by gradual de∣clinations towards the sands. The rock on which the castle stands, is accessible only by a winding pass cut on its southern side: the narrow limits of its crown will not admit of many works, the whole strength consisting of a single battery on the south-east point, mounted with seven or eight guns, which commands the approach to the island from the sea; but would be of little consequence against a ship of any con∣siderable force. The rest of the summit is taken up with a house for the Governor and guard, the walls of which stand on the very brink of the precipice. This fortress, before the use of gunpowder, from its
<PB N="107" REF="110"/>
situation appears to have been impregnable, the superstructures being above the reach of any engine, and the rocks too high to be scaled. The antiquity of this <HI>castle</HI> is not known, but I should presume it is coeval with the <HI>abbey,</HI> and was used as a place of resort in times of peril, and a stronghold for the religious, whenever they were disturbed in their holy retreat. The present fortifications appear to be the work of the last century. In the military establishment made by Queen Eliza∣beth for <HI>Berwick</HI> in 1576, the castle is noted, and a patent for life was granted to <HI>Sir William Read</HI> as keeper of the fortresses of <HI>Holy Island</HI> and <HI>Farn,</HI> with a yearly payment of 362l. 17s. 6d. per annum.</P>
<P>The ingenious Mr Grose gives the following anecdotes relative to this castle:—<Q>Camden mentions it, so that it is evidently as old as his time. Probably it has been the scene of very few remarkable events: history being nearly as silent with respect to them, as concerning its origin. The first time it occurs, is in the history of the civil war in the time of Charles I. when it appears to have been seized for the Parliament; and according to Rushworth, in an order of the House of Commons, May 7th, 1646, for sending forces thither, this reason is assigned, "it being of such consequence to the northern parts of the kingdom. Probably this consequence arose, more for the conve∣nience of its harbour, than the strength of the castle."</Q></P>
<P><Q>In the year 1647, one Captain Batton was Governor of the island, for the Parliament; to whom Sir Marmaduke Langdale, after the taking of Berwick, wrote the following letter, but without success. The letter, together with the Captain's refusal, were transmitted to the House of Commons, for which they voted their thanks to Captain Batton, and that he should be continued Governor of the place.</Q></P>

<P><Q>Holy Island does not appear ever to have fallen into the hands of the Royalists; for it continued in the possession of the Parliamenta∣rians anno. 1648; when it was (as may be seen in Rushworth) re∣lieved with necessaries by Colonel Fenwick's horse and some dragoons. From that time nothing memorable seems to have been transacted here, till the rebellion in the year 1715, when the seizure of this castle was planned and performed by two men only. In which ex∣ploit, such policy and courage were exerted, as would have done them much honour, had they been employed in a better cause. The following particulars of the story were communicated by a Gentleman whose father was an eye-witness to the facts, and well knew both the parties.</Q></P>
<P><Q>One Lancelot Errington, a man of an ancient and respectable fa∣mily in Northumberland, and of a bold and enterprizing spirit, en∣tered into a conspiracy for seizing this castle for the Pretender; in which it is said, he was promised assistance not only by Mr Forster, the rebel General then in arms, but also by the masters of several French privateers. At this time the garrison consisted of a serjeant, a corporal, and 10 or 12 men only. In order to put this scheme in execution, being well known in that country, he went to the castle, and after some discourse with the serjeant, invited him and the rest of the men, who were not immediately on duty, to partake of a treat on board of the ship of which he was master, then lying in the har∣bour: this being unsuspectingly accepted of, he so well plied his guests with brandy, that they were soon incapable of any opposition. These men being thus secured, he made some pretence for going on shore; and with Mark Errington his nephew, returning again to the castle, they knocked down the centinel, surprized and turned out an old gunner, the corporal, and two other soldiers, being the remain∣der of the garrison, and shutting the gates, hoisted the Pretender's colours as a signal of their success, anxiously expecting the promised succours. No reinforcement coming, but on the contrary a party of the King's troops arriving from Berwick, they were obliged to retreat
<PB N="109" REF="112"/>
over the walls of the castle, among the rocks, hoping to conceal them∣selves under the sea weeds till it was dark, and then by swimming to the main land, to make their escape: but the tide rising, they were obliged to swim, when the soldiers firing at Lancelot as he was climb∣ing up a rock, wounded him in the thigh. Thus disabled, he and his nephew were taken and conveyed to Berwick gaol, where they con∣tinued till his wound was cured. During this time he had digged a burrow quite under the foundations of the prison, depositing the earth taken out in an old oven. Through this burrow he and his nephew, with divers other prisoners, escaped; but most of the latter were soon after taken. The two Erringtons however had the good fortune to make their way to the Tweedside, where they found the custom-house boat; they rowed themselves over, and afterwards turned it adrift. From thence they pursued their journey to Bam∣brough Castle, near which they were concealed nine days in a pea∣stack; a relation who resided in the castle supplying them with pro∣vision. At length travelling in the night by secret paths, they reached Gateshead House, near Newcastle, where they were secreted till they procured a passage from Sunderland to France. A reward of 500l. was now offered to any one who would apprehend them; notwith∣standing which, Lancelot was so daring as soon after to come into England, and even to visit some of his friends in Newgate. After the suppression of the rebellion, when every thing was quiet, he and his nephew took the benefit of the general pardon, and returned to Newcastle, where he died about the year 1746, as it is said, of grief at the victory of Culloden.</Q></P>
<P>The remains of the old <HI>abbey</HI> in the next place require my attention; such parts of this cathedral are standing as give a perfect idea of its original form and appearance. The <HI>monastery</HI> is in ragged ruins, and not worthy to be delineated, the walls having been robbed for the build∣ings in the village, and the erection of the present parochial church.</P>
<P>It is said by some authors, that the <HI>monastery</HI> was built by <HI>St. Cuthbert</HI> of a plain model, without ornament, and enclosed with a high wall, in order that outward objects might not withdraw the attention of the so∣ciety from their divine contemplations.</P>
<P>In Mr West's Antiquities of <HI>Furness Abbey,</HI> we have this short account of the rise and origin of Monastic Orders. <Q>Soon after the christian
<PB N="110" REF="113"/>
religion had made some considerable progress in the east, the policy of the Roman empire exposed the professors of it to many and great in∣conveniencies, and a succession of bloody persecutions: the two last under Decius and Dioclesian more especially obliged many to betake themselves to mountains, deserts, and solitary places, to secure them∣selves from the unrelenting fury of these bloody tyrants: there they found a safe retreat, with time and liberty to give themselves up to the exercises of piety and divine contemplation, in a course of most rigorous mortifications, and preternatural austerities. This kind of life, which necessity gave rise to, was afterwards in the time of the Christian Emperors, embraced through choice; and <HI>Pacomius</HI> about the middle of the 4th century, committed to writing rules for regu∣lar societies, and founded some monasteries in the environs of Thebes in Egypt.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The introduction of Monks into England, is spoken of as a master-piece of policy in the court of Rome, as endeavouring thereby to secure her authority by an increase of property, which would arise to her by the pious donations and offerings of the faithful, and the founding of many religious houses, to be occupied by such as were, from the nature of their institute, attached to the Holy See, and might occasionally serve every purpose of spiritual tyranny. And it is alledged, that the Monks by the austerity of their religion and morals fascinated the minds of the people, and by their pretension to extra∣ordinary sanctity, secured a submission to all their decisions, and an implicit obedience to all their doctrines. This is a heavy charge, and if well grounded, should have prevented the monastic rule from ever taking effect in any kingdom, or occasioned its ruin as soon as the discovery was made, or the charge formed.</Q></P>
<P>This he obviates, by monasteries being established here before Austin's time; and takes for his authorities Gildas and Bede, as to their being schools of christian learning. He adds, <Q>in all this, we hear nothing of foreign connections, of sinister inventions, or hypocrisy.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The Roman Pontiff knew how to draw from the circumstances of William's afrairs, advantages which the Conqueror never intended; and which his immediate successors could not prevent, as they were equally or more obliged to the church for her support, than he himself had been. The foreign Ecclesiastics which the Norman King

<FIGDESC>depiction of Lindisfarn Abbey</FIGDESC>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="111" REF="115"/>
introduced, readily gave up the liberty of a country, to which they were strangers, and a happiness the sweets whereof they had never known: but from that consequence, of which the Conqueror and his sons had made them, they soon became sensible of ther own impor∣tance; the foreign Monks, from the great property conferred upon them, soon found of what weight they were in the scale of govern∣ment, and readily turned it to their own advantages, as occasion of∣fered.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The introduction, therefore, of so many new orders of Monks into England by the Norman Kings, was according to their own policy, and not that of the Court of Rome.</Q>—He then takes occasion to men∣tion the good offices of the church in favour of the Conqueror's younger sons, and the Earl of Moreton and King John.</P>
<P><Q>The Court of Rome could have no direct hand in all this; and the monastick institute, of its own nature, can have no part in either a civil or a spiritual tyranny, unless where perverted; as the best of institutes may have been, by the malice of men.</Q>—I have been led to lengthen the quotation beyond the bounds I at first intended, to shew with what arguments this subtle author, and other writers of the like class, can put a plausible countenance on facts, which reflected disho∣nour on the See of Rome. But to return from this digression.</P>
<P>The cathedral is in the form of a cross, the east and west limbs of which are yet standing, the other parts totally in ruins, and almost level with the ground. The order of building in this structure is rude and heavy, and most of it in the worst mode of the early Saxon architecture. Mr Grose says, <Q>probably it was the work of different periods; great part of it seems very ancient, the arches being circular, and the co∣lumns very massy and much like those at Durham, but richer. On the north and south walls there are pointed arches, which proves that part of it at least was built since the reign of Henry II.</Q> The pil∣lars on which the arches rise in the center of the cross are clustered and plain capitalled, each forming the corner of the great tower; these arches are of few members. There are two side ailes, the columns of which are heavy, and the arches circular: the windows are nar∣row, and ornamented with a corner pilaster, and a moulding of few members: the walls are very thick, and every part wears a gloomy countenance. The south wall of the middle tower is standing about 50
<PB N="112" REF="116"/>
feet high; and one corner tower on the west end of the church remains perfect.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The cathedral, with the town of Fenham, and the town and church of Norham were given by William de Carilepho, to the monastery of Durham. Monast. Angl. Vol. 1.</NOTE> These ruins retain at this day one most singular beauty, the tower has not formed a lanthorn, as in most cathedrals; but from the angles, arches sprang, crossing each other diagonally, to form a canopy roof. One of those arches yet remains, unloaded with any su∣perstructure, supported by the south-east and north-west corner pillars, and ornamented with the dancette or zig-zag moulding, much used in old Saxon architecture, extending a fine bow over the chasm and heap of ruins occasioned by the falling-in of the ailes. The whole structure is composed of a soft red free-stone, which yields much to time, and renders the aspect of the building dark and melancholy. Mr Grose's account comprehends the following particulars:</P>
<P><Q>Various fragments of the offices of this monastery are still stand∣ing, and foundations of buildings are scattered over a close of near four acres; the main walls of the church on the north and south sides are still standing, though much out of the perpendicular; inclining outwards so considerably, as to make the horizontal distance between them, at the top, exceed, by near two feet, that at the bottom. Ano∣ther winter or two seems to be the utmost they can stand.</Q></P>
<P><Q>This building consists of a body and two side ailes, into which it is divided by a double row of very solid columns, whose shafts are richly ornamented. Each row has five columns of four different con∣structions, and two pilasters in the walls on the east and west ends. The shafts of these columns are about 12 feet high, their diameters about five, their capitals and pedestals are plain, they support circular arches, having over each arch two ranges of windows; the lowest large and in pairs, separated only by a short column; the upper small and single. The length of the building is about 138 feet, the breadth of the body 18 feet, and that of the two side ailes about nine feet each.</Q></P>
<P>The prospect from this island is beautiful; to the northward you command the town of <HI>Berwick,</HI> over an arm of the sea about seven miles in breadth: at nearly the same distance you view <HI>Bambrough Castle,</HI> on a bold <HI>promontory,</HI> towards the south: on the one hand you have a

view of the open sea, at the time of our observation calm and resplen∣dent, and scattered over with vessels; and on the other hand a narrow channel, by which the land is insulated, about two miles in width; the distant shore exhibits a beautiful hanging landskip of cultivated coun∣try, graced with a multitude of cottages, villages, and woodlands.</P>

<P>The holy Bishop Aidan, when he was near the close of life, having exercised the episcopal of∣fice for 17 years, remained in a royal village not far from the city of Bebba: for having a church and habitation there, he used frequently to reside at that place, for his greater convenience of preaching in the adjacent country; he never resting long in a place, having no possessions but his church, and a small spot of ground thereabout: being sick, he erected a hut, close to the wall, on the west side of the church. In this place he gave up the ghost on the last day of August, in the 17th year of his episcopacy. His body was carried to Holy Island to be interred in the church-yard of the monastery; but shortly after, a more spacious church being erected there, dedicated to St. Peter, his bones were removed, and with much religious ceremony in∣terred on the right side of the high altar.</P>

<P>In the paintings of one of the windows in the cathedral church at Durham, <HI>St. Aidan</HI> is re∣presented in his episcopal garb, with a crosier in his hand, whilst his soul is carried to heaven in a sheet by two angels.</P>
<P>The effigies of this Saint were placed at the north door of the entrance into the quire of the cathedral at Durham, underneath which was the following inscription: <Q>Sanctus Aidanus na∣tione Scotus, Monachus Monasterii de Hii, Episcopus factus per Oswaldum vocatus, anno gratiae 635, fundavit sedem Episcopalem &amp; Monachorum congregationem in insula Lindisfar∣nensi, ac gentem Berniciorum, co-operante sancto Oswaldo ad fidem Christi convertit.

<P><HI>Oswald,</HI> the second son of <HI>Ethelfrid,</HI> succeeded to both the kingdoms (<HI>Deira</HI> and <HI>Bernicia</HI>) a noble and virtuous Prince, whose chief study was to promote the christian religion. To this effect he sent his Embassadors unto Donald IV. then reigning in Scotland, and entreated him by the old familiarity that had been among them, to help him with some worthy and learned men that could instruct his people in the faith of Christ. The King recommending the matter to the Clergy, one <HI>Cormanus</HI> was elected to go thither; but his labours proving unprofitable, he returned about the end of the year, and in a synod of the Bishops and Clergy, informed them, that they were a people so <HI>indocile and froward,</HI> that the pains taken upon them were lost, they neither being desirous nor capable of instruction.</P>
<P>It grieved the synod exceedingly to hear this, and while they were consulting what to do, <HI>Aidanus,</HI> a learned man and reverend preacher, is said to have advised them not to give over the work at any hands, for that the bad success of <HI>Cormanus</HI>'s labours might possibly proceed from himself, that had not used the people tenderly, nor according to the Apostle's rules <Q>fed them at first with milk;</Q> and therefore desired some other approved man might be employed of new, who would probably do good among them.</P>
<P>This opinion allowed by all, none was thought fitter for this service than he who had given the advice; and so with common consent was <HI>Aidan</HI> ordained Bishop, and appointed to that charge. Being come thither, he set himself to amend the fault which he supposed <HI>Corman</HI> had committed, and so tempered his doctrine, as multitudes of people daily did resort unto him to be instructed. It was great hinderance unto him at first, that he was not skilled in the <HI>Saxon</HI> tongue, neither did the people understand his language; but this defect the King himself sup∣plied, interpreting to the auditory all that <HI>Aidanus</HI> delivered in his sermon: so by the King's zeal, and <HI>Aidanus</HI>'s diligence, such numbers were brought to the christian profession, as in the space of seven days 15,000 persons were by him baptized.</P>
<P>Whether this people were more happy in their King or in this Bishop, it is difficult to say, for the King he did so excel in piety and prudence, that, as <HI>Beda</HI> writes, all the nations and provinces within Britain were at his devotion; and not the less his heart was never lifted up within him, but still he shewed himself courteous and affable, and of the poor most compassionate. Among examples of his liberality towards these, the same <HI>Beda</HI> related, that sitting at table on Easter-day, and <HI>Aidanus</HI> by him, when it was told that a number of poor men were at the gate expecting his alms, he commanded to carry the meat that was set before him unto them, and the platter of silver wherein it was to be broke in pieces, and distributed among them. <HI>Ai∣danus</HI> beholding it, took the King by the right hand, and kissing it, said, <HI>"Nunquam marcesca haec manus,"</HI> never let this hand consume or wither; which, as he writeth, came also to pass, for being killed in battle, and his arm and his hand cut off, the same was enclosed in a silver shrine, and remained for many years uncorrupted, in the church of St. Peter, at <HI>Bambrough.</HI></P>
<P>As to <HI>Aidanus,</HI> he was an ensample of abstinence, sobriety, chastity, charity, and all other episcopal virtues; for as he taught, so he lived, was idle at no time, nor did he admit any of his retinue to be so, but kept them in a continual exercise, either reading scripture or learning the psalms of David by heart. If he was invited to any feast (as rarely he went) he made no stay, but after a little refreshment taken, got himself away. In preaching he was most diligent, travelling through the country, for the greater part on foot, and instructing the people where∣soever he came. In a word, he was deficient in no duty required of a good Pastor; and having governed the church in those parts most happily the space of 17 years, he died in the <HI>Isle of Lindisfarne,</HI> the place he chused for his residence, where he was also buried.</P>
<P>After his death, which happened in the year 651, <HI>Finianus</HI> was ordained Bishop, and sent to the Northumbers, from Scotland.</P>

Their frugality, simplicity of life, and par∣simony appeared in the place of their residence, in which there was no∣thing unnecessary, or unadapted to the simplest accommodation: in the church only magnificence was permitted. Their possessions consisted chiefly in cattle, for money was no longer retained than till a fit oppor∣tunity offered to distribute it to the poor. Places of entertainment for Potentates and Princes were unnecessary, for they were visited only for their doctrines and the holy offices of the church. The King himself, when he came thither from his royal residence, had no other object in view than to partake of the rites of religion, and departed immediately after the service: if perchance he took refreshment, it was of the com∣mon fare of the Monks. The attention of these Pastors was on spiritual matters only; temporal affairs were deemed derogatory of their holy appointment; and thence arose the high veneration which was paid by all ranks of people to the religious habit. When any Ecclesiastic went from his monastery, it was to preach the word of salvation, and he was every where received with joy, as a messenger of the Divinity: on the road, the passengers bowed the head to receive the sign of the cross and his benediction, with pious reverence noting his precepts, as documents of the most salutary purport: the churches were crowded with a devout
<PB N="119" REF="123"/>
audience, and when a Monk was seen entering a village on his travels, the inhabitants flocked about him, entreating for his admonitions and prayers. On their visitations, riches and donations were not their pur∣suit; when a religious society received any augmentation of the reve∣nues of the house, it was through compassion by the donor, and they accepted it as an additional store with which they were entrusted for the benefit of the poor.</P>

<P>Wilfred was the preceptor of King <HI>Alfred;</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Many anecdotes of Wilfrid take place in the account given of Hexham and its Prelates.</NOTE> he was a Northumbrian by birth, and received his education at Lindisfarn: being recommended by Queen <HI>Eanfleda</HI> to a Nobleman called <HI>Cudda,</HI> who retired to this mo∣nastery, he attended him thither as his companion, and continued there from the 14th to the 18th year of his age. During this Prelate's epis∣copacy there happened great revolutions and changes in the See of <HI>Lin∣disfarn;</HI> the death of King <HI>Oswy</HI> was only a part of the calamities which fell upon <HI>Northumberland</HI> in his time: <HI>Egfrid</HI> not only obtained the throne of the deceased Sovereign, but by his powerful interest and ef∣forts deposed <HI>Alfred,</HI> assuming the second scepter, and uniting the whole in one sovereignty. <HI>Wilfred</HI> was a proud aspiring man, and debased the pall of the Prelate with ambition. He became obnoxious to Theo∣dore, who determined to humble him, and in a short time got his de∣position effected. Theodore had great interest with <HI>Egfrid,</HI> which he used on this occasion, to gratify his malice and resentment; and under that ordinary craft of Ecclesiastics, a specious pretence for the advance∣ment of religion and the honour of the church, he obtained the royal mandate to divide <HI>the kingdom of Northumberland</HI> into two dioceses, on a presumption that one Bishop had too much power and authority. This ancient diocese then underwent a severance, and the two parts
<PB N="120" REF="124"/>
were distinguished by the names of <HI>York</HI> and <HI>Lindisfarn:</HI> that of <HI>York</HI> comprehending the district of <HI>Deira,</HI> and Lindisfarn that of <HI>Bernicia.</HI> The adopted supremacy of Rome, gave opportunity for appeal, and <HI>Wilfred,</HI> burning with resentment and disappointed ambition, fled thi∣ther, where a chapter being readily obtained, he returned with the Pope's resolution in form for his restoration. Big with the supreme mandate, he obtruded himself abruptly on the royal presence; but to his great mortification, found the King exasperated at his insolence and impudent appeal: not being the vassal of the See of Rome, he pro∣fessed his contempt of its commands, reproached <HI>Wilfred</HI> for having procured his credentials by bribery, and as a presumptuous offender against the royal dignity, he cast him into prison. His lamentable si∣tuation excited the intercession of the devout <HI>Ebba,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>St. Ebba,</HI> daughter of <HI>Edilfrid</HI> King of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> was Prioress of <HI>Coldingham</HI> in Scotland.

He then fled to the court of <HI>Adelwack</HI> King of <HI>Sussex,</HI> whose subjects were just receiving the light of conversion, and that King gave him a Bishopric called <HI>Selsey.</HI> Upon <HI>Egfrid</HI>'s demise, the crown of <HI>Northumberland</HI> de∣volved upon <HI>Alfred;</HI> and <HI>Theodore</HI> declining in health and strength, as he approached the grave in the steps of old age, grew anxious to acquit or relieve his conscience of the severities he had exercised against <HI>Wilfred,</HI> sought to gain his friendship, and by his interest with the Crown and earnest solicitations, obtained his restoration to the See of <HI>York. Wilfred</HI> had no sooner reassumed his ecclesiastical dignity, than his ungovern∣able ambition and arrogance blazed out anew: the See of <HI>York,</HI> at his first assumption of the episcopal dignity, held in unity the kingdom of <HI>Northumberland;</HI> at his restoration it was dismembered by a triple seve∣rance, by the disunition of <HI>Lindisfarn</HI> and the new constitution of <HI>Hex∣ham. Wilfred</HI> made injudicious pretensions and claims to effect a re∣union, which so exasperated the King, and was a thing so inconsistent with the politics of the times, that he was again expelled, and obliged to fly the realm. He now sought refuge in the court of <HI>Mercia,</HI> where
<PB N="121" REF="125"/>
he won upon the ear of <HI>Etheldred,</HI> and gained from him the Bishopric of <HI>Leicester.</HI> Adversity is said to be the school of wisdom, but it proved not so with <HI>Wilfred;</HI> for in this new institution he conducted himself with that insolence and impropriety, that he soon incurred the displea∣sure of the Mercian King and the Archbishop of Canterbury, who brought him to trial before a synod, and deposed him. He was now 70 years of age, and yet his powers were so little debilitated, and his passions remained so warm, that he again journeyed to Rome, and in spite of the character of a turbulent and contentious Prelate, which he carried with him, obtained a decree for his restoration. He returned a second time with the powers of Rome in his favour, and at a more favourable season to obtain the rewards of his labour. The Archbishop found it convenient at that time to adhere to the mandate of supre∣macy; the Mercian King had fallen into a state of enthusiasm, and as∣sumed the habit of a Monk; the King of <HI>Northumberland</HI> was under the attacks of a dangerous disease, and feeling compunctions for the suf∣ferings <HI>Wilfred</HI> had undergone, became reconciled to him. Appearances were now much in the Prelate's favour, and the propitious hour seemed to await him, but Fate snatched off <HI>Alfred</HI> before a restoration was ef∣fected. He obtained a council to be held upon the banks of the river <HI>Nidd,</HI> under the mandate of King <HI>Osred, Alfred</HI>'s successor, where with great difficulty he gained the Bishoprick of Hexham, a small and mo∣dern member of his former See.</P>

<P>Once upon a time when the saint was preaching in a certain village to a crowded audience, the alarm was given that there was one of the cottages on fire, this drew a number of people from the sermon to extinguish it, which was just what satan proposed; the more water they threw on it, the more fiercely it seemed to burn, and all efforts to put it out seemed inef∣fectual. The saint missing so many of his auditors, enquired the cause, when leaving off his preaching and repairing to the scene of action, he perceived it was all illusion, and ordered a few drops of holy water to be sprinkled on it; on which the devil sneaked off, and the fire dis∣appeared.</P>

<P>Extracts from the Legend of St. Cuthbert, or the Histories of his Churches at Lindisfarne, Cunecascestre, &amp; Dunholm, by Robert Hegg, 1626.—A Manuscript in the Bishop's Library at Durham.</P>
<P>"At which tyme I finde, that <HI>St. Cuthbert</HI> was a shepheard, and that in the dead of the night, he saw the soule of the said Bishop carryed up with great melody by a quire of angells into heaven; which heavenly vision soe seaz'd upon his affection, that resolving upon an holyer course of life, he thought he could betake himself to noe better place then to the abby of <HI>Mail∣rose,</HI> built by <HI>Aidanus</HI> upon the banks of <HI>Tweed;</HI> but the devill to crosse his good intent, meetes him in his journey, and after a good cudgeling, was glad to leave him; for proof whereof, in the same place to this day (if you will borrowe an optick-glass from superstition) you may see the printe of his cloven foote: Neither did his valour, but also his humulitie appeare, when overtaken by night and hunger, he was forc'd to succour himselfe under an old cottage, where he found noe other guest for entertainment, then an horse, which turning up the hay, disco∣vered a loafe of bread, at which the Saint right glad, said grace, and giving the horse one halfe, satisfied himselfe with the other, and the next day came to <HI>Mailrose,</HI> where he had no sooner entred, but <HI>Boysilus</HI> Prior of the abby, by a propheticall phisiognomy, as if he had read in his face his sanctite, solemnly receives him in his armes, and presents him to <HI>Eata</HI> the Ab∣bat, who committed him to <HI>Boysilus</HI> for his tutor, who taught him <HI>St. John's</HI> gospell, in that booke, which in honour of the schollar, was kept in the abby at Durham in Prior <HI>Turgots</HI> tyme, on which, after soe many centuries of yeares, noe moth durst ever presume to feede.</P>
<P>"In this abby, after he had spent in the perfection of a monasticall life 15 yeares, he was prefer'd by <HI>Eata</HI> the Bishop, to the Priorie of <HI>Lindisfarne.</HI> In this <HI>Holy Island</HI> (so christned in after ages for <HI>St. Cuthbert's</HI> sanctitie) stood that renouned monastery founded by <HI>K. Oswald,</HI> and was the mother church and nurcery of religion among the <HI>Bernicians</HI> under <HI>Aidanus,</HI> from whom the episcopall race of the Prelates of the church of <HI>Durham</HI> reckon their succession.</P>
<P>"In this island <HI>fourteen</HI> Bishops successively ascended the episcopall seate; among whom, as a glorious starre of the first magnitude, <HI>St. Cuthbert</HI> shyned in the firmament of this church; where after twelve yeares he had borne the dignity of the Priorship, he became a votary to an anachoreticall life, and choosed the island <HI>Farne,</HI> seated in the maine ocean, for the place of his hermytage. This island as voyd of trees, water, and graine, as full of devills, became the stage whereon <HI>St. Cuthbert</HI> acted all his miracles; for at his arrival, the spirits that frequented this isle were put to slight, the rocks powred out their water, and as if there had beene a return of the golden age, the earth brought forth corne without tillage, with many more wonders, if they might bee reported upon the creditt of a legend: but these are enough to shewe what ad∣vantage
<PB N="124" REF="128"/>the Monkes took of the blind devotion of that age, whose study and whole practise was to devise and relate miracles of their Saints, which (as superstition is alwaies credulous) were as easily beleeved: Thus to gaine from the <HI>Pagans</HI> a reverend opinion of christianity, they thought it but a pious fraud to cosen the people with volumes of wonders, who whiles they defended trueth by forgeries, their impostures discover'd to wiser ages, have rather made reli∣gion suspected, then any way advanced it: but if I should proceed in this discourse, I should leave <HI>St. Cuthbert</HI> too solitarie in his cell at <HI>Farne,</HI> where for want of other auditors, I finde him in the history preaching to birds that eate his corne, who soe confuted them out of the text, with <HI>aliena non concupisces,</HI> that they never after touch'd his harvest. In like manner he reclaymed two crowes from their wonted stealing and rapine, that pull'd thatch of his ancho∣rage for to build their nests, and made them so penitent, that they lay prostrate at his feete for absolution.</P>
<P>"In this isle he voluntarilye suffer'd nine yeares imprisonment from the society of men, soe wholly devoted to heaven, that he remembred not he was upon earth, and for a whole yeare forgott to put off his shoes: but he could not live soe obscurely in his cell, as his same was re∣splendent abroad; and in a synod at <HI>Alne upon Twysord</HI> he was in his absence chosen Bishop: This dignity was prophesied to him long before whiles he was a child, by an infant of three yeares old, who gravely reproved him, <HI>Fye Saint Cuthbert! what a Presbyter and a Bishop, and playing among boyes?</HI> as if at that tyme he had seene him in his myter and crosier staffe; but <HI>St. Cuthbert</HI> had so wedded his affection to a solitary life, that neither letters nor embassadors from the synod could perswade or command him to take upon him the government of the church, till King <HI>Egfrid</HI> himselfe, attended with both the Lords temporall and spirituall, sayled to his hermytage, and with the same company might have besieged and taken a city whiles they were conquering his resolution.</P>
<P>"The King to enlarge his diocesse gave him a great part of the city of <HI>Yorke,</HI> and the village of <HI>Creca</HI> with three miles compasse about it, as also the cittie of <HI>Carliel</HI> with the circuit of fif∣teen miles about it: but for all this, <HI>St. Cuthberts</HI> mind was still on his anchorage, whither shortly he betooke himselfe againe, and in contempt of honour, edded his life in his cell. But it shall be no part of his funerall prayses thus to unman himselfe to contemplate himselfe into a God or <HI>Silvanus,</HI> for what was this else then to excommunicate himselfe from the common∣weale, and to finne against the definition of a man, to whom societie is as naturall, as to bee a creature: and surely religion cannot bee the motive of such an unnaturall act, but rather in all such anchorites a melancholy distemper is usually mistaken for devotion.</P>
<P>"His last will and testament was to his Monkes to bury him at the east side of his oratory, in a coffin that venerable <HI>Cudda</HI> the Abbat gave him, which they should finde hid in the ground at the north side of his cell, and to putt his corps in the shirt that <HI>Verca</HI> Abbatesse of <HI>Tinmouth</HI> had sent him for a token (which for the reverence of that holy woman he had never worn in his life time,) and lastly, if the <HI>Pagans</HI> should invade them, and force them to flye, that they should carry with them his bones: All these desires were performed; onely at the weeping re∣quest of the Monkes, he permitted that his body should bee transported to <HI>Lindisfarne,</HI> where in <HI>St. Peters</HI> church, at the right side of the high altar, he was solemnly enshrined anno domini 687.</P>
<P>"But to returne to <HI>Saint Cuthbert,</HI> who had now an eleven yeares lyen in his sepulchre, when the Monkes thought to place his bones, by this time drye and disrobed of flesh, among their other reliques, for kisses and adoration: but behold a wonder! They looke for a skeleton, but found an entire body, with joints flexible, and flesh so succulent, that there onely wanted heate to make his body live without a soule; nay his very funerall weedes were so fresh, as if putrefaction had not dared to pluck him by the coate. This was rather to pay his debt to hea∣ven then to nature; who after he had restored his soule to God, should keepe back the pay∣ment
<PB N="125" REF="129"/>of his body from corruption. In other men it is true, that sleepe is the image of death, but here the grave suffer'd a cheat, and death was the image of sleepe.</P>
<P>"This miracle <HI>St. Beda</HI> reports (who was an eleven yeares old at <HI>St. Cuthberts</HI> death) in re∣lating whereof he made no lye, but perhaps told one. The history of whose life and death, he writ from the information of the Monkes of <HI>Lindisfarne,</HI> who had defloured all the miracles of Saints in holy writt, and bestowed them upon their <HI>St. Cuthbert;</HI> who, like man in paradise, had the beasts to doe him homage, and the sea monsters to aske him blessing: Like <HI>Abraham</HI> he entertayned three angells at the monasterie of <HI>Rippon:</HI> A raven brought <HI>Elias</HI> flesh, and an eagle brought <HI>St. Cuthbert</HI> fish. As he sayl'd with his mother from <HI>Ireland,</HI> his native soyl, into <HI>Scotland,</HI> he lett the book of Psalmes fall into the sea, which forthwith was swallowed up of a sea calfe, and by the same fish delivered to them at their landing. Take here the psalter for a man, and the sea calfe for a whale, and you have the history of <HI>Ionas,</HI> with many such histories of wonder, with which the Monkes delighted the superstition of the times.</P>
<P>"After this illustrious miracle of <HI>St. Cuthbert's</HI> incorruption, <HI>Lindisfarne</HI> rais'd itselfe to that height of renowne, that <HI>Ceolwolphus</HI> the King, to whom <HI>Bede</HI> dedicates his English Historie, resigned an earthly crowne to gaine a celestiall one, and tooke upon him the habitt of a Monke in <HI>Lindisfarne;</HI> a welcome man you may be sure to that monastery, for whose sake, it was graunted the Monkes there to drinke wine or ale, who before were onely to drinke milke or water, though they that dranke after <HI>Saint Cuthbert</HI> in his cupp, found sometimes water turn'd into wyne without a miracle.</P>
<P>"Many kingly treasures did this devout Prince bestowe upon that monastery, with such large possessions, as he seem'd rather to resigne his kingdome to the church than to his successour, and became a Monke to make <HI>St. Cuthbert</HI> a King: for he endowed that monastery with all the land betweene the rivers of <HI>Tees</HI> and <HI>Weer,</HI> and many townes and lordships, as <HI>Warkworth Castle, Billingham, Gedworth,</HI> (where <HI>Ceolwolphus</HI> built the church,) and diverse other villages, as <HI>Woodcestre, Hutingham, Bresgen, Edulingham,</HI> names that for ought I know, have outlived their townes, or townes that have chang'd their names.</P>
<P>"After the manifestation of this miracle of bodily immortality after death. <HI>Eadfrid</HI> then Bi∣shop, caused him to be lay'd in a new sepulchre, and to be advanced for state and reverence above the pavement in the sanctuary, for it was not fitt that he should have his grave among the dead, whose body lived by sanctity when his soule was gone.</P>
<P>"Now they began to worship the very ground <HI>St. Cuthbert</HI> had troad upon, whose sanctity was such, that he made every place he came in a church; and <HI>Eadfrid</HI> in honour of <HI>St. Cuth∣berts</HI> presence, there built up his hermitage; where, as if a genius of sanctity had frequented that place, <HI>Ethelwald</HI> a Monke of <HI>Rippon</HI> lived an Hermite twelve yeares.</P>
<P>"Thus for a long tyme flourished the Monkes of that church in great repute and prosperity, till the <HI>Danes</HI> disturbed their peace, who now began to make incursions upon the frontiers of this land, for many yeares continueing their piracies, till they had made a final conquest, which at length yeilded to the <HI>Norman</HI> sword. Those were the tymes, when so many monasteries (which the devotion of former ages had erected) had their funerals: then perished that famous Emporium of <HI>Hartlepoole,</HI> where the religious <HI>Hieu</HI> built a nunnery, of which I may speake as <HI>Hildebert</HI> of <HI>Rome,</HI>
<Q>Quam magna fueras integra, fracta doces;</Q>
whose ruines shew how great shee was in her glory, but now remayns to passengers both a mo∣nument of devotion and hostility: then were demolished the two monasteries of <HI>St. Peter</HI> and <HI>St. Paul</HI> at <HI>Weremouth</HI> and <HI>Jarrow,</HI> built by the reverend Abbats <HI>Celfrid</HI> and <HI>Benedict.</HI></P>
<P>"The furie of the <HI>Danes</HI> still encreasing, continued by the sea costes to <HI>Tinmouth,</HI> so that it was now tyme for the Monkes of <HI>Lindisfarne</HI> to look about them; for they well understood by
<PB N="126" REF="130"/>the lamentable usage of their neighbouring abbyes that the <HI>Danes</HI> would not, like the devill, bee affrighted with holy water, and saw by the bad successe of other monasteries, that it was not safe trusting to the protection of a Saint, and so concluding upon flight, putting all their reliques into <HI>St. Cuthberts</HI> coffin, they left the <HI>Pagans</HI> the spoyle of an empty church, anno Domini 893.</P>
<P>"It was <HI>Eardulphus</HI> his fortune to bee Bishop in these troublesome tymes, who with his whole Cleargy and families of People, followed this sacred bier; which, besides seaven Monkes, as deputed Esquires of his body, none durst presume to touch. These miseries had beene enough to have unfainted <HI>St Cuthbert,</HI> when pursued both by forreine foes, and overtaken with an home-bred enemy, famyne, he could afford them no releife. They were now come to the first sea, and might complaine as the old <HI>Brittanes</HI> did to <HI>Actius</HI> the Consull, <HI>Repellunt nos Barbari ad mare; repellit mare ad Barbaros; inter haec duo oriuntur genero functum, aut jugulamur, aut mergimur.</HI> But because the disrespective sea would not divide itselfe at the approach of <HI>St. Cuthbert,</HI> the Bishop with some fewe of his Monkes, determin'd privily to sayle over into <HI>Ire∣land</HI> with his corps, that there he might finde rest for his toumbe, where he first had his birth. But they had not farre sail'd from the shore, but the winds and the sea were both up in armes against their shippe, which both <HI>Aeolus</HI> and <HI>Neptune</HI> might have reverenced for her sacred car∣ryage of a Bishop and his Clergy: but the sea roared soe loud, that noe prayers for <HI>St. Cuthbert</HI> could bee heard, but threaten'd them so near with shipwracke, as they had not that confidence in their Saint, as to encourage the marriners as Caesar did, <HI>Ne metues, Cuthbertum vehis!</HI> who now himself wanted some other Saint to invocate for helpe, and was in daunger to bee drowned after he was dead. Where had then beene the <HI>church of Durham,</HI> and the devotion of Kings to his sepulchur? Where had then beene the <HI>tutelarie Deity</HI> against the <HI>Scotts,</HI> and the lande of the church called <HI>St. Cuthberts patrimony?</HI> How then should his <HI>halywarke-folk</HI> be freed from tribute and service in warre, and the Monkes of Durham fed soe many yeares with ease and fatt revenues, if now their Saint had beene entombed in the sea, and erected his episcopal seate among the fishes? This sacrilegious storme strucke this shippe with such a palsie, that it shak't out the texts of the Evangelists into the sea: This book <HI>Eadfrid</HI> Bishop of <HI>Lindisfarne</HI> had writ out with his own hand, and <HI>Belfrid</HI> the Anchorite had curiously paynted and guilded it, in which art the Monkes were admirably expert; not that I taxe in them this quality, but onely, it argued the Monkes were at great leasure. Thus, whether the sea, as envying the land such a precious jewell as <HI>St. Cuthbert,</HI> or he himself to shew his dislike for <HI>Ireland,</HI> had raised this storme, it was not long 'till in a calme they were carryed to the shore from whence they sett forth: but great sorrow you must imagine was for the drowned booke, 'till one <HI>Hundredus</HI> (one of the seven that carryed the coffyn) was bid in a night vision by <HI>St. Cuthbert,</HI> to goe seeke it on the shoare at <HI>Whitterne,</HI> where he found it in its former beautie and splendour, which was kept in <HI>Prior Turgots</HI> tyme in Durham, in memory of the miracle; when the water seem'd to run out of herselfe to doe homage to <HI>St. Cuthbert,</HI> and would rather loose her nature then wett his book. If this were true, then I am sure that <HI>St. Cuthberts</HI> bookes had twice bet∣ter fortune in the sea, then they have now in his library at Durham, which was once a little vatican of choyce manuscripts, but now rather a <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> than a library; rather a sepulcher f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r bookes, than a place to conserve them: but this is the disease of most church libraryes, since the inventing of printing, by which, men finding a more compendious way, and a cheaper passage to superficial learning, have bequeathed old manuscripts to the mothes and jackdawes, the onely students at this day in such libraries.</P>
<P>"But to returne to the forenamed Monkes, who had another oracle by night from <HI>St. Cuth∣bert,</HI> to repair to a certaine tree, whereon he should finde a bridle, at the sight whereof, a dunne horse should proffer his service (for ease of the Monkes) to drawe <HI>St. Cuthberts</HI> body lay'd upon a wagon: but this was not to steale an horse, because it was an horse of <HI>St. Cuthberts</HI>
<PB N="127" REF="131"/>providing, the conduct whereof (as if he understood more of <HI>St. Cuthberts</HI> minde than the rest) they followed whither soever he drew him, and at length, by the providence of the horse, they came to the monastery of <HI>Creca,</HI> where for foure moneths they were kindly entertayned by the Abbat and his Covent, and had leasure to tell storyes of their travailes.</P>
<P>"From this abby, in a revelation by night, <HI>St. Cuthbert</HI> sent <HI>Aeadred</HI> Abbat of <HI>Luell,</HI> upon an embassage to the campe of the <HI>Danes,</HI> that they should crowne <HI>Guthredus</HI> King, whom they had sold to a widdow; a thing in those days not practiced by the Pope to dispose of kingdomes. But what authority he had to nominate a King, or what reason they had to believe a dreame, must be rank'd amongst <HI>St. Cuthberts</HI> miracles: for <HI>Guthred</HI> thus to bee made a King, what was it else then to become <HI>St. Cuthberts</HI> subject, and to oblige his royalty to those Monkes that as boldly encroacht upon soe fayre an advantage? For first, they require the restauration of their episcopal seat in <HI>Cuncacestre,</HI> where <HI>Eardulphus</HI> first ascended the pontifical chayre. And it was but another dreame, for the foresayd Abbot to goe to the King from <HI>St. Cuthbert,</HI> and bid him give all the lands betwixt <HI>Weer</HI> and <HI>Tyne</HI> for ever to his church. This modest request must bee graunted, or else the Monkes would be ready to upbrayd him with ingratitude. Ah poor Prince! to bee thus rob'd of his kingdome, and to receive a diademe, to set it upon <HI>St. Cuth∣berts</HI> head! Thus was the religious King cheated of his soveraignty by those Monkes that had now got the art of anslaving the devotion of Princes to their private ends; for at this tyme also, the great <HI>Alfred</HI> swore fealty to <HI>St. Cuthbert</HI> and his Clergy, by whose help they perswaded him, that he had got the victory over the <HI>Pagans.</HI> This made them bold also to ask the privi∣ledge of a sanctuary for their church, to reskue offenders 37 dayes at <HI>St. Cuthberts</HI> sepulchre, that neither Justice should curbe the freedome of sinning, either against heaven or the state; for noe other use was commonly made of asylums, than, that men might offend more securely, and disloyally appeal from the King and the Lawes to the protection of a Saint. Neither was this enough, 'till King <HI>Alfred</HI> must by his royal charter free the inhabitants of <HI>St. Cuthberts</HI> lande from tribute to the King, which he sealed with fearful anathem's to his successors, that should infringe the said liberties. What else was this, than for a King to bee a Traitour to his own Majesty, and deprive himself of that service, which even by the law of nature is due from a Subject to his Prince.</P>
<P>"Now in what reverend esteem this Saint was to King <HI>Alfred,</HI> I gather from the consecra∣tion of the chappel to <HI>St Cuthbert</HI> in <HI>University Colledge</HI> in <HI>Oxford,</HI> where he is said to bee the first founder: in an antient window whereof <HI>King Alfred</HI> and <HI>St. Cuthbert</HI> are painted together, the King bespeaking the Saint in a pentameter,
<Q>Hic in honore tui Collegium statui;</Q>
and <HI>St. Cuthbert</HI> thus replying in an hexameter,
<Q>Quod statuisti in eo, pervertentes maledico;</Q>
and by such curses, the Monks maintayn'd their lands in a better tenure than under the Kings broad seale. The like malediction you may read in a distick in <HI>Trinity Colledge</HI> in <HI>Oxford,</HI> en∣graven in wooden letters over the screene,
<Q><L>Terras Cuthberti qui non spoliare verentur,</L>
<L>Esse queant certi, quod morte mala morientur;</L></Q>
which colledge was founded by <HI>Thomas Hatfield</HI> Bishop of Durham, anno Domini 1340.</P>
<P>"Thus after <HI>Eardulphus</HI> (the last Bishop of <HI>Lindisfarne,</HI> and the first of <HI>Chester</HI>) had shared with <HI>St. Cuthbert</HI> both in his prosperity and adversity, and had seene this new church sprung up like a phoenix out of the ashes of the former, he ended his life in a full age, and was so∣lemnely enterred anno Domini 894; in which yeare also died the victorious <HI>Alfred,</HI> who on his death bedd, bequeathed his love of <HI>St. Cuthbert,</HI> as a precious legacy to his sonne <HI>Edward,</HI>
<PB N="128" REF="132"/>chargeing him to be as well heire to his devotion to that Saint, as to his kingdomes. King <HI>Edward</HI> also, as if it had beene <HI>ex traduce</HI> to those Princes to honour <HI>St. Cuthbert,</HI> left his sonne <HI>Athelsian</HI> executor of his love to that church.</P>

Once indeed to oblige a Lady, the Abbess of Colding∣ham, he paid her a visit at the Isle of Coquet, where going down to the sea shore, as was his custom every night, two sea monsters presented themselves kneeling before him, as if to demand his benediction, which having received, they returned to the deep.

<P>This life of severity excited the reverence and admiration of those ages of ignorance. Whether enthusiasm alone could determine the hu∣man mind to such undertakings, or there was a degree of pride mixed in the influenza, I cannnot determine. The vices of those times, I pre∣sume, were not attended with such degrees of despair as are unknown to us; the inducements must have been more complicated than the out∣ward countenance of piety expressed. How different the manners of the religious of the same church in modern times. <Q>An ambitious or hypocritical religious, who makes a profession of humility, whilst he is puffed up with pride; a man meanly clad, and who only seeks after riches; a pretender to devotion, who gives himself out as a servant of God, while he is no more than a slave to his passions, is a monster both in church and state.</Q>—<Q>Every intriguing Monk or Friar, who thrusts himself into families, for the purpose of prying into secrets, regulating marriages or wills, is as despicable as he is dangerous.</Q>— These are the liberal sentiments of the immortal Ganganelli, Pope Cle∣ment XIV. whose works have placed the Romish church in a more amiable point of view, than it has appeared in several past ages.</P>
<P>I have frequently ruminated on man's several affections, and this se∣verity of <HI>St. Cuthbert</HI>'s restores to my memory some distant ideas. I have always considered <HI>Friendship</HI> as comprehending the most excellent feelings of the human heart: how a social and generous-minded man could live without the enjoyment of friendship, and totally withdraw himself from all attachments with the world, is to me truly a severity little to be comprehended. I presume the Saint must have held the
<PB N="131" REF="135"/>
very argument <HI>Mr Hume</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hume's Eassays. Nat. Hist. of Religion, vol. 2. p. 469.</NOTE> adopts to account for the austerities of su∣perstitious men. <Q>Nor is it satisfactory to say, that the practice of morality is more difficult than that of superstition; and is therefore rejected. For, not to mention the excessive pennances of the <HI>Bach∣man</HI>'s and <HI>Talaponis;</HI> it is certain, that the <HI>Rhamadan</HI> of the <HI>Turks,</HI> during which the poor wretches, for many days, often in the hottest months of the year, and in some of the hottest climates in the world, remain without eating or drinking from the rising to the setting sun; this <HI>Rhamadan,</HI> I say, must be more severe than the practice of any moral duty, even to the most vicious and depraved of mankind. The four Lents of the <HI>Muscovites,</HI> and the austeries of some <HI>Roman Catho∣licks,</HI> appear more disagreeable than <HI>meekness</HI> and <HI>benevolence.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>Perhaps, the following account may be received as a true solution of the difficulty. The duties which a man performs as a friend or parent, seem meerly owing to his benefactor or children; nor can he be wanting to these duties, without breaking through all the ties of nature and morality. A strong inclination may prompt him to the performance: a sentiment of order and moral obligation joins its force to these natural ties: and the whole man is truly virtuous, is drawn to his duty, without any effort or endeavour. Even with re∣gard to the virtues, which are more austere, and more founded on reflection, such as public spirit, filial duty, temperance, or integrity; the moral obligation, in our apprehension, remove all pretension to religious merit; and the virtuous conduct is deemed no more, than what we owe to society and to ourselves. In all this, a superstitious man finds nothing, which he has properly performed for the sake of his Deity, or which can peculiarly recommend him to the divine fa∣vour and protection. He considers not, that the most genuine me∣thod of serving the Divinity, is by promoting the happiness of his creatures. He still looks out for some more immediate service of the Supreme Being, in order to allay those terrors, with which he is haunted. And any practice, recommended to him, which either serves to no purpose in life, or offers the strongest violence to his na∣tural inclinations; that practice he will the more readily embrace, on account of those very circumstances, which should make him ab∣solutely reject it. It seems the more purely religious, because it pro∣ceeds
<PB N="132" REF="136"/>
from no mixture of any other motive or consideration. And if, for its sake, he sacrifices much of his ease and quiet, his claim of merit appears still to rise upon him, in proportion to the zeal and devotion which he discovers. In restoring a loan, or paying a debt, his Divinity is in no wise beholden to him; because these acts of justice are what he was bound to perform, and what many would have performed, were there no God in the universe. But if he fast a a day, or give himself a sound whipping; this has a direct reference, in his opinion, to the service of God. No other motive could engage him to such austerities. By these distinguished marks of devotion, he has now acquired the divine favour; and may expect, in recompence, protection and safety in this world, and eternal happiness in the next.</Q></P>
<P>But I will quit this review, to return to the more interesting features of <HI>Friendship.</HI></P>
<P>If we compare <HI>Friendship</HI> to the other affections of man, we see <HI>Love</HI> has a powerful influence on the human heart; but its bounds are con∣fined, and its conclusions selfish; it has but one object to possess: its attachments are rigorous indeed, but full of prejudice; and its whole influence centers in an <HI>Egoity,</HI> wherein generosity and honour lose much of their lustre.</P>
<P><HI>Gratitude</HI> is an excellent operation of the soul; our obligations are therein duly estimated: it is a confession of our former indigence; and self-importance is refined by such humiliation: it depends on the com∣parison which is drawn, between our own wants and the bounty re∣ceived. <HI>Gratitude</HI> is a branch of <HI>moral honesty,</HI> a confession of <HI>the debt of obligation.</HI></P>
<P>Yet <HI>Friendship</HI> is abundantly superior to <HI>Love</HI> and <HI>Gratitude;</HI> it is an affection of the heart, in which <HI>Benevolence</HI> presides: it is accompanied by an openness of mind, wherein <HI>Generosity</HI> and <HI>Honour</HI> are exemplary, without selfishness, or price, or consideration of reward. In <HI>Friendship,</HI> the bosom is expanded and elated; secrecy, guile, and concealment are expelled; and probity, truth, and virtue reign in their place. There is an energy in <HI>Friendship,</HI> to which every faculty contributes: it fires the soul with fervour, and fills the heart with gladness. You act there∣in, from the same principles, as would conduct your own nearest and most momentous affairs: it is that <HI>divine perfection,</HI> to which we are
<PB N="133" REF="137"/>
peculiarly exhorted: <HI>Love your neighbour as yourself.</HI> With our friend all disguise is thrown off; the political guise of politeness, which masks sincerity, is taken away; the heart leaps with affection; the eyes gaze with rapture, approbation, and esteem; the countenance glows with expressions of delight; the bosom is unlocked, the treasures of the bo∣som are thrown abroad; you fear no treachery, you are open and con∣fident; you communicate with the same joy you receive instruction, and all is pleasure.</P>
<P>Such were the feelings my youth experienced in the possession of a friend. How often hath the young mind hung enraptured in the asso∣ciation of my friend. The cordiality that then took place was as dear as life. Riper manhood hath retained the whole, though in a graver degree.</P>
<P>I think I hear the Saint reply, <Q>the warmth of our sociability freezes up with declining youth, our cordiality cools as age advances, and our openness of heart decreases, as the frauds of mankind, and dis∣appointments of life, advance upon experience: we grow afraid of the hidden dangers our confidence hath often prompted; and we gra∣dually treasure up in our memories, the lessons of example, and the inferences of experience; which, like the sepulchres of the dead, only remind us how many friends are departed, how many disasters are incident to life, how little dependence there is on man, and how vain is all human confidence in the things of this world.</Q></P>
<P>If such is the consequence of age; if the delightful taste of <HI>Friendship</HI> passeth away; I will cling to the departing footsteps, I will grasp at the sacred verge, from whence to fall, is to depart from the first, and the finest enjoyment of human life; the only possession on earth, which gives an idea of the communion of angels.</P>
<P>To return to our Saint. He was elected by the Synod of <HI>Aln,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cuthbertus in Synodo apud Twiford juxta Alne flu. a Theodoro Archiepiscopo cantaur: in episcopum Lindisfar. electus est.

<P>Thus, after nine years continuance of a solitary life in the Isle of Farne, was this pious man induced to assume an episcopal duty. He was consecrated at York on the 7th day of April, being Easter day, in the year 685, and in the 11th of the reign of King <HI>Egfrid.</HI> The King was present at this ceremony, with seven Bishops. He was first made Bishop of <HI>Hexham,</HI> and thence translated to <HI>Lindisfarn,</HI> in the place of <HI>Eata,</HI> who was removed to <HI>Hexham.</HI> On this occasion <HI>Egfrid,</HI> with the Metropolitan <HI>Theodorus,</HI> in testimony of their love and reverence for this holy Prelate, gave to the church of Lindisfarn all the land from the walls of the church of St. Peter, in York, to the west gate of the city, and from the same church to the city wall on the south; also the village of <HI>Craike,</HI> with territories there not less than three miles in cir∣cuit, that the Bishops might have a house of rest as they should pass to
<PB N="135" REF="139"/>
and from York;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Dedit ei Rex Ecfridus in Civitate Eboraco a muro Ecclesiae S.

<BIBL>Lel. Col. v. 1. p. 327, 328.</BIBL></NOTE> and also added Carlisle, with a large district, to this See.</P>
<P>Some short time preceding the consecration of <HI>St. Cuthbert,</HI> the mo∣nastery of <HI>Coldingham</HI> was consumed by fire. The religious society of this house consisted of Monks and Nuns,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">This association of Monks and Nuns is said to be grounded on the words of our Saviour, John xix. 26, 27.</NOTE> who occupied separate parts of the edifice; but the severities of a devoted life, and the strict rules professed in such societies, were not sufficient to prevent a shameful re∣laxation of discipline, and many gross abuses and enormities took place; insomuch, that the destruction of this stately edifice was regarded as a judgment, for the crimes and pollutions of its inhabitants. The mo∣nastery of <HI>Lindisfarn</HI> looked upon the event with religious horror, and soon after <HI>Cuthbert</HI> was made Bishop, he forbid the approach of women to the convent, and even denied them access to the church where the Monks performed their devotions: he caused a small chapel to be erected in a distant plain on the island for the reception of the female sex, from its situation taking the name of Greenchurch. From thenceforth the women were excluded the churches or cemeteries where St. <HI>Cuthbert</HI>'s body rested; and some miraculous punishments are related which at∣tended infringements on this injunction. In the cathedral church at Durham the pavement is distinguished by a cross of black marble, be∣yond which women were not allowed to advance towards the choir.</P>
<P><HI>Cuthbert</HI> enjoyed his change of life and dignities but a very short time, for within two years finding his health declining, and his mind being by habit tempered more for solitude and silence than the duties of this high office, he resigned the See, and returned to his cell in <HI>Farne,</HI>
<PB N="136" REF="140"/>
where he survived only two months, yielding his spirit to God on the 20th day of May, 687, in the 53d year of the creation of the See of <HI>Lindisfarn,</HI> and 37 years after he had assumed the monastic habit at <HI>Mailross.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>He directed by his last will, that his body should be buried at the east end of the oratory, in a stone coffin given him by the holy <HI>Tuda,</HI> and wrapped up in a sheet presented him as a token by <HI>Virca</HI> Abbess of Tynemouth, which out of reverence to that holy woman he had never used: and lastly, if the island should be invaded by Pagans, he ordered the Monks to fly from them, and carry his bones away with them. These directions were none of them performed, his body was transported to Lindisfarn, where in St. Peter's church, at the right side of the high altar, he was solemnly laid in a tomb of stone; but the Monks left behind them the coffin for which he expressed such regard, which still continues to be shewn at Farne Island, and it is highly probable they were not more mindful of the sheet</P>

<P>Thus construed: Alfredus me jussit fabricari.</P>
<P>Mr Wallis speaking of this portrait, has the following remarks. <Q>King Alfred preferred these characters to the Saxon, and when he swayed the scepter, brought them in use. This curious memorial of St. Cuthbert was found in the very place of that glorious Monarch's re∣treat and deliverance from the Danes, fortified by him in the time of war, and in time of peace converted into a monastery.

<P>St. Cuthbert's shrine had the privilege of sanctuary, where fugitives were safe for 37 days. This respite allowed criminals a time for making restitution, or under the feudal laws they would have suffered immediate pains and punishments: it was the process by which the rigour of common law was moderated; and when kept in due restraint was of great benefit to man∣kind: but by an enormous extension which took place, it produced infinite mischiefs to the community and to the state.</P></NOTE></P>

The subjects of this expostulation, were chiefly the importance of a Bishop's duty, and the greatness of the charge which he had as∣sumed: he entreated him to recognize the divine commission, as being the ordination of the great missionary of heaven: that he should re∣buke the proud in the vanity of their high station, and instruct them in the duties of humiliation: that they should not erect churches for the sake of popular admiration and worldly honour, but as works of piety only, for the propagation of religion and virtue: that he should visit his Clergy, and reprove or lop off those branches which were contami∣nated

with the vices of the age: and that his leisure hours should be appropriated to acts of devotion and study, and not sacrificed to plea∣sures, luxuries, and indolent ease. <HI>Egfridth</HI> was Bishop for 24 years: he departed this life in 721, and was buried at Lindisfarn.</P>

happened in the 17th year of the reign of <HI>Osbert</HI> King of <HI>Nor∣thumberland.</HI> By some authors it is ascribed to the resentment of <HI>Bruern Brocard,</HI> a Northumbrian Nobleman. <HI>King Osbert</HI> having come to <HI>Bruern</HI>'s castle in his absence, was most courteously received and en∣tertained by his Lady, of whom he became enamoured; and in defi∣ance of all the principles of humanity, hospitality, and justice, con∣strained her to receive his embraces. <HI>Bruern</HI> on his return being in∣formed of the irreparable injury and disgrace he had sustained by this royal rape, went to court, attended by his kindred and dependents, and solemnly renounced his allegiance, and the lands he held of the King: then taking his passage immediately to <HI>Denmark,</HI> he fell at the feet of <HI>King Guthred,</HI> to whom <HI>Bruern</HI> was related, describing his injury in such pathetic terms, and uttering his grief with that energy, that the Danish Monarch readily hearkened to his requests, fitting out a power∣ful fleet and great army for the coasts of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> under two Generals who were brothers, <HI>Inguar</HI> and <HI>Hubba.</HI> Matthew of Westmin∣ster says, the principle view of this Danish expedition, was against the dominions of Edmund King of the East Angles, who was falsly charged with putting to death the father of the Danish chieftains, who had been assassinated by an exiled traitor. They had proposed to land, this au∣thor says, on the coasts of Edmund's kingdom, but by contrary winds being driven northwards, they landed at <HI>Berwick upon Tweed.</HI> The convent of <HI>Coldingham</HI> having been restored after a former conflagration, was then possessed, it is said, by Nuns, under an Abbess called <HI>Ebba,</HI> of royal blood. She dreading the barbarities these invaders exercised in their former descent, on all ranks of religious, in an assembly of her Nuns representing the hazard their chastity was in, communicated a device which she presumed would preserve them from these violators. Without hesitation they vowed that her rules should be strictly observed. Forthwith she drew out a razor, and as an example, with the greatest fortitude, cut off her nose and upper lip: she was followed by the whole sisterhood. When the <HI>Danes</HI> entered the convent in the morning, they were shocked with the horrid spectacle, and disappointed in their lusts, set fire to the edifice, wherein the Abbess with all her whole convent
<PB N="145" REF="149"/>
were consumed.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There is the greatest improbability in this relation, touching the massacre of Ebba and her Nuns. In the time of Ebba who was of royal race, the society consisted of Monks and Nuns; and she was dead before St. Cuthbert was consecrated Bishop of Lindisfarn, and made the regu∣lation noted in regard to the female sex.—The reader will correct the note at p. 120. If the name of the Abbess of Coldingham, at the time of this descent of the Danes, was Ebba, it could not be Ebba daughter of Edilfrid King of Northumberland.</NOTE> This is the story of Matthew of Westminster; but other authors,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. Sym. Dunelm. &amp;c.</NOTE> whose relations are attended with greater probability, fix the place of this Danish descent at the mouth of the Humber, from whence the invaders marched to <HI>York. Osbert</HI> at their approach led forth a powerful army, and engaged them near the city, where he fell amongst the slain, and his troops were totally routed. <HI>Aella,</HI> who had held a conflict of five years for the kingdom of <HI>Northumberland</HI> with <HI>Osbert,</HI> under the support of <HI>Bruern</HI> and his allies, is said upon the Da∣nish invasion to have come to a compromise with <HI>Osbert,</HI> and joined with him against the common enemy; and that in the battle, he also fell with <HI>Osbert.</HI> This account gains greater credit than that of <HI>Bruern</HI>'s application to the <HI>Danes;</HI> and it seems most probable, the object of this invasion was no other than rapine and plunder. The <HI>Danes</HI> after this victory, having laid waste the country between <HI>York</HI> and the <HI>Tyne,</HI> made <HI>Egbert</HI> King of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> north of Tyne, to hold his Crown as their dependent: Being afterwards employed in expeditions against the southern parts of this island, the Northumbrians dethroned this vassal King, and gave the Crown to <HI>Ricsig.</HI> Not long after this the Danish King embarking his troops in some of the southern counties, sailed for the mouth of Tyne, and landed at the town of <HI>Tynemouth,</HI> where he wintered, it being too late in the year to attempt any thing against the Northumbrians. On the opening of the spring they began their ravages on this unfortunate country, and marked their progress with unequalled barbarities: <HI>Lindisfarn</HI> was the object of their peculiar wrath—the christian religion their most inveterate aversion.<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><P>Halfdeni ducis Danorum adventu cognito, Eardulphus Episcopus Lindisfar▪ accito Eadredo viro sancto, abbate monasterii quod S.

<P>King <HI>Alfred</HI> for the first six years was greatly distressed by the Danish invasions: he was at last reduced to the necessity of seeking his safety for a considerable time in an obscure and inac∣cessible retreat, among the Marshes of Somersetshire.

After which he was raised by <HI>Al∣fred</HI> to the throne of the <HI>East Angles,</HI> as a dependent Prince, under the Saxon Monarchy. Whilst <HI>Alfred</HI> endured great distress in his retreat, he was comforted by a vision of this Saint, who promised him the success he afterwards experienced: from hence <HI>Alfred</HI> was inspired with great veneration for him. The body of Danes which had settled in <HI>Northumberland</HI> having lost their Chieftain <HI>Haldan,</HI> remained some time without a leader. <HI>Eadred</HI> the Abbot of <HI>Lindisfarn,</HI> who, together with his Bishop, was still flying from one retreat to another with their sacred charge, assured the Bishop and the whole army of Danes and English, that the Saint had ap∣peared to him in a vision, and expressed his command to them to redeem from slavery <HI>Guthred</HI> the son of <HI>Hardiknut,</HI> a youth sold by the <HI>Danes</HI> to a widow at <HI>Whittingham,</HI> and make him their King.

<P>We continued upon the island so long, in reviewing these venerable remains, as almost to forget we had yet to visit many scenes in this county, as worthy the observation of the Antiquarian and Traveller, as those present to us: and we calculated our departure so ill, that the tide had begun to return, before we entered upon the sands. We thought ourselves secure indeed against all dangers, by having a Farmer from the neighbouring shore for our guide, who had brought over butter that morning for the inhabitants. The tide approached in a singular manner, not flowing forward in waves, but the water increased imperceptably, by oozing through the sands. At first the passage seemed a tract of wet sand, but presently it became a shining plain of level water, unruffled by any influx, reflecting in the most beautiful manner the variegated landskips of the adjoining shores. Our guide rode upon one of those methodical beasts, which keeps up an invariable motion with a kind of mechanical exactness, in spite of every approaching emergency. We expressed our anxiety at the increasing waters, yet not daring to leave our guide, on account of the intercepting gullies, and the apprehension of quicksands, of the situation and nature of which we were totally ignorant. He was unaltered, except in his dialogue, which now was filled with the circumstances of a late Traveller's death, who perished in the passage, wandering on the sands till he could not extricate himself from the surrounding floods. This was no pleasing narrative to us, who were now dashing through the increasing waters, up to our horses girths; our guide's constancy of countenance and un∣moved mind affording us no very agreeable contemplation. I wish to prevent strangers engaging in so disagreeable a project, tho' ours was attended with no other circumstances than anxiety and impatiency of mind; yet had we attempted to make this passage without a guide, it is impossible to determine what would have been our lot.</P>

<HEAD>CASTLE of BAMBROUGH,</HEAD>
<P>whose venerable remains give the traveller an idea of the state of pa∣laces and strongholds, in the remotest aera of our <HI>Saxon ancestors</HI> in Bri∣tain. The scite of this fortress is on the crown of a high rock, trian∣gular in figure, one of the points projecting into the sea. Many of the buildings stand on the very brink of the rocks, to the land side: the aspect towards the sea is very lofty, being near 150 perpendicular feet above the level of low water mark. Part of the most ancient fortifica∣tions on the land side are broken and defaced, by the falling of the cliffs on which they were erected, the same consisting of a soft red stone, which perishes much by the weather. On this side a circular tower remains, of very antique construction, its base projecting in se∣veral tiers. Many of the other buildings appear to be the work of more modern ages, till you approach the gate-way, which is on the only ac∣cessible part of the rock; it was defended by a deep ditch, cut through a narrow neck communicating with the main land, having a draw bridge: this lays to the south-east, and on the brink of the precipice above the sea shore. The gate-way is strengthened by a round tower on each side, from whence passing about 12 paces, which space appears to have been formerly a covered way, you approach a second and machicolated gate, of a much more modern order of building, having a port-culice. After you have passed the second gate, on the left hand, on a lofty point of the rock, stands a very ancient round tower, of great strength, commanding the pass. Assailants having won this approach, entered upon a situation of imminent danger on a tremendous precipice, sub∣ject to every kind of annoyance from the besieged, who possessed the round tower. This part of the fortress wears the most ancient coun∣tenance, and challenges the Saxons for its origin. The ingenious Mr

Grose says, <Q>this is the spot where, according to the Monkish Histo∣rians, stood the castle or palace of the Kings of Northumberland; built, as it said, by King Ida, who began his reign A. D. 559. Part of the present ruins are by some supposed to be the remains of King Ida's work.</Q>—<Q>On the whole, though there was undoubtedly a for∣tress or palace here in the Saxon times, and perhaps earlier, every part of the present buildings, seems to have been the work of the Normans.</Q> On what circumstances Mr Grose grounds this general determination, I cannot discover: most of the northern Norman struc∣tures are of excellent masonry; the buildings here are various in figure, materials, modes of arching, windows, bases, and other parts. The round tower I have noted is different in all those matters, from the greatest part of the works; and it is to a common observer marked with much greater antiquity than the Keep or main tower, which I shall next describe. It is impossible to prevent a disagreement in opinion on subjects of this kind; where there is no certain rule to fix determi∣nation, it must be the case: I pay the greatest deference to Mr Grose's judgment, but think he has passed this determination hastily. The Keep or chief tower of this fortress is a lofty square structure, of the same model with many Norman fortresses founded in or near the time of the Conqueror; it stands on the crown of the rock, having an open area round it, but most extensive towards the north and north-east points. Mr Wallis says, that from the stile of the architecture of its base, being of the Doric order, it is believed to be of Roman work. He adds, <Q>that it is well known the Saxons erected their castles when they could on Roman foundations, and gave them the name of Burg or Brough.</Q> It is very probable the Romans held this part of the country, to be of singular importance to their navy; but that they built castles here, is not by any means admissible. They might erect small towers, like those whose remains appear on the wall of Severus, on places of special import. I do not doubt the Saxons would enter upon the Roman for∣tifications, for the same reasons the Normans after them made such choice: the northern counties furnish a multitude of instances that the Normans possessed themselves of such situations; but in those places the Roman vallum and foss only served for outworks to the Nor∣man structures. The remains of the Roman station are visible at many of those fortresses. In most of the places I have observed, the Roman works are retained as a platform or outward area, to the south sides of the castles. In the northern stations, of the largest size, there are no re∣mains of castles. Whether the Saxons or Normans entered upon those
<PB N="156" REF="161"/>
places, I do not presume to determine. The scite of the Praetorium is to be traced in many, but without any other appearances, than of erections for domestic uses, not shewing a sufficient quantity of ruins, to give the least idea of a decayed castle. Mr Grose says, <Q>some assert the Keep to have been a Roman structure, for which supposition they give the following reasons; its great similarity to the Keep of Dover Castle, and the White Tower of London, both allowed to be Roman —the shape of its arches, which are either flat or semicircular—a Doric base round its bottom, and the great depth of its well, sunk 75 feet, through a whinstone rock.—The first of these is evidently founded on a mistake, neither the White Tower nor the Keep of Dover Castle being Roman, but built since the conquest; the last in the time of King Henry II. proofs of which are to be met with in Dugdale's Monasticon, the Textus Roffensis, and divers other authentic records. Nor is the proof drawn from the shape of its arches more conclusive; semicircular and flat arches are found in almost every building erected before the time of King Henry II. and from the argument deduced from its Doric base, it is not at all wonderful or uncommon, to find the members of Graecian architecture employed in Norman buildings. One instance of this, among many, may be seen at the cathedral of Canterbury, where a massive column, placed in the under-croft, to support some vast weight, has a rude sort of Ionic capital. Besides it is well known most of the architects of those days learned their art at Rome, where they had the Graecian architecture continually before them; of which indeed the Saxon was only a debased kind. After the stupendous works carried on by our Norman ancestors, it seems extraordinary, that the digging of the above-mentioned well should appear so arduous an undertaking, as to be deemed possible to the Romans only. Besides, in Beeston Castle, Cheshire, there is a well full as deep, cut through the solid rock: and that is universally known to be the work of the Normans.</Q></P>
<P>The following remarks, extracted from the same work, will not be unacceptable to the reader: <Q>The stones with which the Keep or great tower is built, are remarkably small, and were taken from a quarry three miles distant. From their smallness it has been conjectured they were brought hither on the backs of men or horses. The walls to the front are 11 feet thick, but the other three sides are only nine. The original roof was placed no higher than the top of the second story. The reason for the side walls being carried so much higher
<PB N="157" REF="162"/>
than the roof, might be for the sake of defence, or to command a more extensive look-out, both towards the sea and land. The tower was however afterwards covered at the top. Here were no chimneys, the only fire place in it was a grate in the middle of a large room, supposed to have been the guard room, where some stones in the middle of the floor are burned red. This floor was all of stone, sup∣ported by arches. This room had a window in it near the top, three feet square, intended to let out the smoke. All the other rooms were lighted by slits or chinks in the walls, six inches broad. The out∣works are built of a very different stone from that of the Keep, being a coarse free stone of an inferior quality, ill abiding the injuries of weather; taken from the rock itself. In all the principal rooms in the outworks there are chimneys, particularly in the kitchen, which measures 40 feet by 30 feet, where there are three very large ones, and four windows; over each window is a stone funnel, like a chim∣ney open at the top, intended as it is supposed to carry off the steam. In a narrow passage near the top of the Keep was found upwards of 50 iron heads of arrows, rusted together into a mass; the longest of them about 7½ inches. In December 1770, in sinking the floor of the cellar, the draw well was accidentally found: its depth is 145 feet, cut through the solid rock, of which 75 feet is of hard whin-stone. In the summer of the year 1773, in throwing over the bank a prodigious quantity of sand, the remains of the chapel were discovered, in length 100 feet. The chancel is now quite cleared, is 36 feet long and 20 feet broad; the east end, according to the Saxon fashion, semicir∣cular. The altar, which has been likewise found, did not stand close to the east end, but in the center of the semicircle, with a walk about it, three feet broad, left for the Priest to carry the Host in procession. The font, richly carved, is also remaining.</Q></P>
<P>This fortress is by Florigelus, Hoveden, and others, attributed to <HI>Ida,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Regnum Nordanhumbrorum incepit XIII<SUP>o</SUP> anno regni Kinrici.

Hoveden, who wrote about the year 1192, says, <Q><HI>Bebba</HI> is a very strong city, but not exceeding large; contain∣ing not more than two or three acres of ground.

<P>It is admitted by all writers that <HI>Bambrough</HI> is of great antiquity, and was a fortress of singular consequence and strength in the early times of the Saxons. It has furnished history with many memorable events.</P>
<P><HI>Penda</HI> King of <HI>Mercia,</HI> still remaining a Pagan, breathed the most in∣veterate hatred against the Christians: having obtained a victory over <HI>King Oswald</HI> in Shropshire, in which he treated the royal captive with the most savage barbarity, like a whirlwind he rushed to the destruction of his country. In the year 642, having ravaged <HI>Northumberland</HI> as far as <HI>Bambrough,</HI> he laid siege to it, and not being able to take the place by storm, attempted to burn it, by raising huge piles of wood against the walls, and setting them on fire; but when his machines were fully prepared, and his piles were burning, the wind suddenly changed, and blowing a storm, the blazing faggots were carried into his camp, and
<PB N="159" REF="164"/>
made a great destruction, insomuch that he was obliged to raise the siege. This deliverance was ascribed, according to the superstition and bigotry of those times, to the prayers of <HI>Aidan</HI> Bishop of Lindisfarn, who for the sake of greater retirement, and an uninterrupted devotion, was then resident on the <HI>Farn Island,</HI> afterwards famous for the cell of <HI>St. Cuthbert. Oswald</HI>'s great zeal for the conversion of his people, his bounties to the church, and his suffering under the hand of a Pagan conqueror, procured him the immortal honours of a Saint and Martyr. His arms were preserved as relics in the church at <HI>Bambrough,</HI> and were believed to remain uncorrupted, through the influence of a blessing pronounced on them by <HI>Aidan,</HI> whilst doing a singular act of charity.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Symeon Dunelm. ch. 1.</P>
<P>Nam tempore episcopatus ejus hostilis Merciorum exercitus, Penda duce, Nortdanhumbrorum regiones impia clade longe lateque devastans, pervenet ad urbem usque regiam, quae ex Bebbae quondam Reginae vocabulo cognominatur, eamque, quam neque armis, neque obsidione capere poterat, flammis absumere conatus est.

<P>After the death of <HI>Alfred,</HI> who had reigned over <HI>Northumberland</HI> near 20 years, the Crown was usurped by <HI>Eardulph,</HI> to the prejudice of <HI>Osred, Alfred</HI>'s eldest son, then an infant of the age of eight years. As this act of <HI>Eardulph</HI>'s portended imminent peril to the young Prince, <HI>Brithrick,</HI> a zealous adherent to <HI>Alfred</HI> and his family, seized the castle of <HI>Bam∣brough,</HI> where he placed <HI>Osred.</HI> It was not long before the Usurper laid siege to the place; but it was so well defended, as to baffle all his at∣tempts, and his assaults were attended with a succession of ill fortune. Whilst <HI>Eardulph</HI> remained before the walls, the people in general de∣clared for <HI>Osred,</HI> and having levied a considerable army, advanced to∣wards the Usurper, who being informed of this unexpected change in the sentiments of the people, prepared to raise the siege and draw off his troops. <HI>Brithrick</HI> at this instant made a vigorous sally, the adversaries were thrown into confusion and soon routed, <HI>Eardulph</HI> was taken pri∣soner, and immediately executed, and <HI>Osred</HI> ascended the throne of his ancestors, to the great joy of his subjects.</P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="165"/>This was the place of <HI>Alured</HI>'s retirement, when he fled from <HI>York,</HI> to avoid the dangers of civil commotion, having in the ninth year of his reign been deserted by his family and nobles. He was descended of <HI>Ida,</HI> but through the misery of those times obliged to abdicate the throne of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> and seek for safety under <HI>Cynoth</HI> King of the <HI>Picts.</HI></P>
<P>In the reign of <HI>King Egbert</HI> this castle was the prison of <HI>Cynewolf</HI> Bishop of Lindisfarn: his imprisonment began in 750, and continued for 30 years, being accused as an accomplice in a crime, of which some authors assert he was innocent.</P>
<P>According to Florence of Worcester, <HI>Alred,</HI> the son of <HI>Eardulph,</HI> whom <HI>Athelstan</HI> expelled, (on the death of <HI>Sititric,</HI> who married <HI>Athelstan</HI>'s sister, and was by him raised to the Northumbrian throne) in the year 926 seized this fortress, and made himself master of the dependent ter∣ritories, but was soon forced to fly before the arms of <HI>Athelstan.</HI></P>
<P>In the descent made by the <HI>Danes</HI> about the year 933, this fortress suffered greatly, but was soon afterwards restored, and new works were added. It is said a great booty fell into the hands of these invaders, by the reduction of <HI>Bambrough.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Waltheof Earl of Northumberland,</HI> in his declining years, was disturbed by an incursion of the Scots, under <HI>Malcolm</HI> their King: he retired to this fortress, whilst his son <HI>Uchtred,</HI> a valiant youth, raised a few troops to oppose the army of the invader. He gained an advantageous post, and with great bravery made such an attack upon the undisciplined Scots, that they were soon thrown into confusion, and after suffering a dreadful slaughter, made an inglorious conclusion of their invasion, by a precipitate retreat into their own country. <HI>Uchtred</HI> did not conduct his success with temperance; he sullied his victory with cruelty, inhu∣manly slaughtering in cold blood, the nobility and officers of rank which were among his prisoners, their heads becoming the horrid fur∣niture of the walls of <HI>Durham.</HI> King <HI>Ethelred</HI> overlooked this barba∣rity, and rewarded his valour by giving him in marriage his daughter <HI>Edgiva,</HI> with a princely portion; his father resigning his possessions to the young hero, the King added thereto the county of <HI>York.</HI> The sa∣vage barbarity of those times is shocking to humanity; there was sel∣dom a victory obtained in the reciprocal depredations made on the
<PB N="161" REF="166"/>
borders, but the utmost cruelty and undistinguished slaughter was the consequence. The warfare itself was infamous; for it was no better than robbing by a Banditti commanded by Kings, who sullied the lustre of a Crown by impious acts which will for ever remain ignomi∣nious in story.</P>
<P>In the year 1015, the Danes again besieged and took this place, and pillaged it.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lel. Col. v. 2. p. 285.</NOTE></P>
<P><HI>Bambrough</HI> is said to have been in good repair at the time of the conquest, when it is probable it was put into the custody of some trusty Norman, and had additions made to the works; as the present area contained within its walls measures upwards of eight acres, instead of three, as described by Hoveden<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Grose.</NOTE></P>
<P>Whilst Malcolm King of Scotland was carrying his horrid ravages along the banks of Tees, Gospatric made an incursion into Cumberland, which the Scottish King then held by force of arms; and having laid waste the country, he returned to Bambrough loaden with spoils: but this was succeeded by a severe revenge, for Malcolm soon after entered Northumberland, and after cruel depredations, carried with him a mul∣titude of the inhabitants into slavery.<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><P>Dum sic saevit Malcolin, Cospatricius comes Cumberland: vastavit, ac cum spoliis onustus rediit, &amp; in Bebbanburg munitione firmiss: se conclusit.

<P>In the reign of <HI>William</HI> II. A. D. 1095, on the defection of <HI>Mowbray Earl of Northumberland,</HI> the royal troops laid siege to <HI>Bambrough,</HI> under the command of the Sovereign, the Earl having taken refuge there. The King finding the place impregnable, to distress the garrison, and cut off all succours of men and provisions, he erected a fortress in the neighbourhood, according to the art of war practised in those days, which was named <HI>Malvoisin,</HI> or the bad neighbour, in which he placed a strong garrison, and drew off the main body of his army southward. The Earl by means of a secret correspondence held with some of the
<PB N="162" REF="167"/>
garrison of <HI>Newcastle,</HI> had entertained hopes of making himself master of that place: with that intent, under covert of the night, he set out from <HI>Bambrough,</HI> accompanied by 30 horsemen, but being observed by the garrison of <HI>Malvoisin,</HI> was pursued. When he arrived at <HI>Newcastle,</HI> he found the gates shut against him, and the garrison apprized of his intention: he was now reduced to the necessity of flying to the monastery of <HI>St. Oswin</HI> at <HI>Tynemouth,</HI> where he was besieged six days, and received a wound in his leg; at length he and his followers having retired to the sanctuary, in defiance of the holy prescription, were dragged forth, and delivered up prisoners to the King.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Robertus de Mulbrai comes Northumbr. &amp; Gul. de Auco cum multis aliis regem Gul.

<LG>
<L>THE King is gone from Bambrough castle:</L>
<L>Long may the Princess mourn,</L>
<L>Long may she stand on the castle wall,</L>
<L>Looking for his return.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>She has knotted the keys upon a string,</L>
<L>And with her she has them ta'en,</L>
<L>She has cast them o'er her left shoulder,</L>

<L>She tripped out, she tripped in,</L>
<L>She tript into the yard:</L>
<L>But it was more for the King's sake,</L>
<L>Than for the Queen's regard.</L>

<LG>
<L>It fell out on a day the King</L>
<L>Brought the Queen with him home:</L>
<L>And all the Lords, in our country,</L>
<L>To welcome them did come.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Oh! welcome father, the Lady cries,</L>
<L>Unto your halls and bowers;</L>
<L>And so are you my stepmother,</L>
<L>For all that is here is yours.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>A Lord said, wondering while she spake,</L>
<L>This Princess of the North</L>
<L>Surpasses all of female kind</L>
<L>In beauty, and in worth.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The envious Queen replied, at least</L>
<L>You might have excepted me;</L>
<L>In a few hours, I will her bring</L>

<L>The Princess stood at her bower door</L>
<L>Laughing: who could her blame?</L>
<L>But e'er the next day's sun went down,</L>
<L>A long worm she became.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>For seven miles east, and seven miles west,</L>
<L>And seven miles north, and south,</L>
<L>No blade of grass or corn could grow,</L>
<L>So venomous was her mouth.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The milk of seven stately cows,</L>
<L>It was costly her to keep,</L>
<L>Was brought her daily, which she drank</L>
<L>Before she went to sleep.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>At this day may be seen the cave,</L>
<L>Which held her folded up,</L>
<L>And the stone trough, the very same</L>

<L>Hence quickly let us sail;</L>
<L>My only sister Margaret</L>
<L>Something, I fear, doth ail.</L>

<L>The worm leapt up, the worm leapt down,</L>
<L>She plaited round the stane;</L>
<L>And ay as the ship came to the land</L>
<L>She banged it off again.</L>

<LG>
<L>The child then ran out of her reach</L>
<L>The ship on Budle sand;</L>
<L>And jumping into the shallow sea</L>
<L>Securely got to land.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And now he drew his berry-brown sword,</L>
<L>And laid it on her head;</L>
<L>And swore if she did harm to him</L>
<L>That he would strike her dead.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Oh! quit thy sword, and bend thy bow,</L>
<L>And give me kisses three;</L>
<L>For though I am a poisonous worm,</L>
<L>No hurt I will do to thee.</L>

<L>Oh! quit thy sword, and bend thy bow,</L>
<L>And give me kisses three;</L>
<L>If I am not won e'er the son go down,</L>
<L>Won I shall never be.</L>

<LG>
<L>He quitted his sword, he bent his bow,</L>
<L>He gave her kisses three;</L>
<L>She crept into a hole a worm,</L>
<L>But stept out a Lady.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>No cloathing had this Lady fine,</L>
<L>To keep her from the cold;</L>
<L>He took his mantle from him about,</L>
<L>And round her did it fold.</L>

<LG>
<L>He has taken his mantle from him about,</L>
<L>And it he wrapt her in;</L>
<L>And they are up to Bambrough castle,</L>
<L>As fast as they can win.</L>

<L>He now rejoiced to see them both</L>
<L>Again to him restored.</L>

<L>The Queen they wanted, whom they found</L>
<L>All pale, and sore afraid,</L>
<L>Because she knew her power must yield</L>

<L>Woe be to thee, thou wicked witch,</L>

<L>I will turn you into a toad,</L>
<L>That on the ground doth wend;</L>
<L>And won, won shalt thou never be</L>

<L>Now on the sand near Ida's tower</L>

of forces from <HI>Galloway</HI> and <HI>Cumberland,</HI> with <HI>King David</HI> at their head, they advanced to <HI>Northallerton,</HI> and soon after were defeated at the battle of <HI>the standard.</HI></P>
<P>In the conditions of peace made between King Stephen and King David I. of Scotland, it was stipulated, that the earldom of Northum∣berland should be conclusively settled on Prince Henry, David's son, with all its appendages, except <HI>Bambrough</HI> and <HI>Newcastle,</HI> which the English Monarch was to retain on Henry's receiving a compensation by lands in the south of England. All the Barons within this earldom did homage to Prince Henry for their estates, with a salvo for the fealty they had sworn to King Stephen, it having also been premised, that the laws and customs established by King Henry I. in Northumberland should remain in force. This treaty was ratified at Durham, in the month of April, A. D. 1139, in the presence of Maude Queen of Eng∣land and a great assembly of the Barons of both nations; and there∣upon the King of Scotland and his son entered into compact for the maintenance of peace with England during their lives; for the observ∣ance of which Cospatric Earl of March, Hugh de Morvill, Fergus Mel and Mac were given as hostages.</P>
<P>King Henry II. in the third year of his reign, had restored to him, by Malcolm IV. King of Scotland, the northern territories which King Stephen had granted to David King of Scotland: and therewith King Henry was put in possession of the city of Carlisle, the castle of Bam∣brough, and Newcastle upon Tyne. It is presumed by some authors, that David having taken advantage of the broils in which King Ste∣phen was involved, had seized the castle of Bambrough; as in the treaty when the earldom of Northumberland was resigned to Prince Henry, this fortress and Newcastle were expressly reserved to the Crown of England.</P>
<P>In the 16th year of <HI>King Henry the Second's</HI> reign, some great work seems to have been added to this fortress, as in Madox's History of the Exchequer, under the article of Amercements, it appears one <HI>William,</HI> son of <HI>Waldef,</HI> was fined five marks for refusing his assistance in the King's works at <HI>Baenburg Castle:</HI> he was fined also 40s. to have a re∣spite touching the said works. Perhaps at this time <HI>the Keep</HI> was built; its great similarity to that of <HI>Dover,</HI> the work of that reign, makes it at least probable.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Grose.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="166" REF="171"/>In the time of King Richard I. <HI>Hugh Bishop of Durham</HI> held this castle, but his power was of short date; for the King being offended at his insolence, disseized him of this place, together with the county of <HI>Nor∣thumberland,</HI> and imposed on him a fine of 2000 marks.</P>
<P><HI>William Heron,</HI> son of <HI>Jordan Heron,</HI> who held a barony in this county by the service of one Knight's fee, as his ancestors had done from the conquest, was in the 32d year of King Henry III. constituted Governor of <HI>Bambrough Castle,</HI> and of <HI>Pickering</HI> and <HI>Scarbrough,</HI> in Yorkshire: in which appointments he was succeeded in the 37th year of the same reign, by <HI>John Lexington,</HI> Knt. Chief Justice of the Forests North of Trent.</P>
<P>In 1296, King Edward I. summoned <HI>John Baliol,</HI> King of Scotland to renew his homage at this castle; but the proud vassal forgetting his fidelity, contemned the command, and levied an army to resist the English arms, if Edward entered his kingdom. Edward burning with indignation at this insolence, marched to <HI>Berwick,</HI> which he took by storm, and put the garrison to the sword. From thence proceeding to <HI>Dunbar,</HI> near which place the Scotch army waited his approach, an engagement ensued, in which the English were victorious: the field of battle was covered with innumerable carcasses, 22,000 Scots, some His∣torians assert, fell that day. <HI>Dunbar</HI> was taken, and <HI>Baliol</HI> was made prisoner. The great trophy of this victory, was <HI>the stone chair</HI> in which the Kings of Scotland had been crowned from the earliest times. This was the <HI>palladium</HI> of the Scotch, the loss of which shook the superstition of the whole empire. This <HI>chair</HI> was brought in triumph to England, with the King in chains, and was placed in <HI>the abbey of Westminster,</HI> where it has remained for regal honours ever since—a degree of appro∣priation which nothing but the bigotry and superstition of that age could have decreed to it in England.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">To increase the superstitions import of this <HI>palladium</HI> of <HI>monarchy,</HI> it is reported that it contains or is composed of the stone of <HI>Beth-el,</HI> on which <HI>Jacob</HI> slept when he had the beatific vision, and received the promises of inheritance from the voice of the Supreme.</NOTE></P>
<P><HI>Isabel de Beaumont,</HI> related to <HI>Eleanor</HI> Queen of Edward I. sister to Lord Henry Beaumont, and widow of <HI>John de Vesey,</HI> afterwards wife of <HI>John Duke of Brabant,</HI> had a grant of this castle for her life, on proviso that she did not marry again. During her possession, <HI>Piers de Gaveston, Earl
<PB N="167" REF="172"/>
of Cornwall,</HI> was protected here from the vengeance of an injured and incensed nobility. In 1312, he was dragged from the castle of <HI>Scar∣brough,</HI> and given up to the hands of his adversaries.</P>
<P>In the year 1311, this castle, on the marriage of the Lady Vesey, was reassumed by government, and given to Lord Percy.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Carte, II. 320. Dug. I. 273.</NOTE></P>
<P>In 1355, Earl Murray being taken prisoner by King Edward III. was committed prisoner to this castle, from whence he was removed to Not∣tingham, and lastly to Windsor.</P>
<P>It was held for a short time by <HI>Roger Heron,</HI> a younger son of <HI>William Heron</HI> before mentioned; after which it was conferred on <HI>Henry Percy,</HI> for his good services in the Scotch wars. In this family it continued for several ages, and a grant of this castle, together with the manor and fee farms of the town, was made to his grandson for life. In the reign of King Henry VI. <HI>Henry Percy, Earl of Northumberland,</HI> was Constable. During the contention between the King and the House of <HI>York,</HI> there were divers Governors, according to the party which hap∣pened to be victorious. <HI>Sir Ralph Grey</HI> and <HI>John Lord Wenlock</HI> were both of them Constables for Henry VI. the latter in the 25th year of that King: he nevertheless sided with King Edward IV. and served under him at <HI>Towton.</HI></P>
<P>In the second year of the reign of King Edward IV. an insurrection of the Lancastrian party appearing in the North, the King advanced to <HI>Northumberland,</HI> and at once laid siege to the three castles of <HI>Alnwick, Dunstanburgh,</HI> and <HI>Bambrough.</HI> Ten thousand forces invested the latter under the command of the <HI>Earl of Worcester,</HI> the <HI>Earl of Arundel,</HI> the <HI>Lord Ogle,</HI> and the <HI>Lord Montecute:</HI> the <HI>Duke of Somerset,</HI> the <HI>Earl of Pembroke, Lord Roos,</HI> and <HI>Sir Ralph Percy</HI> maintained the fortress until Christmas eve, when it was surrendered. The Lords <HI>Pembroke</HI> and <HI>Roos</HI> effected their escape, and the <HI>Duke of Somerset</HI> and <HI>Sir Ralph Percy</HI> received the royal pardon. The <HI>Queen</HI> still struggling against the tor¦rents of adversity, such in the whole, as royalty seldom ever experi∣enced, again made head in <HI>Northumberland. Sir Ralph Grey</HI> surprized the castle of <HI>Bambrough,</HI> which was then in the keeping of <HI>Sir John Astley;</HI> and he garrisoned it with Scotch troops: but the battle of <HI>Hex∣ham
<PB N="168" REF="173"/>
Levels</HI> soon put a final end to these commotions, and gave a con∣clusive blow to the hopes of the House of <HI>Lancaster. Sir Ralph Grey</HI> and <HI>Sir Humphrey Nevill</HI> were excepted in the general pardon. <HI>Nevill</HI> soon afterwards suffered at <HI>York,</HI> but <HI>Sir Ralph Grey</HI> knowing his perilous estate, held out the castle of <HI>Bambrough</HI> until July. The Lords <HI>Montecute</HI> and <HI>Warwick</HI> conducted the siege. A tower being beat down by the canon, <HI>Sir Ralph</HI> received such bruizes by its fall, that he was taken up for dead; and the garrison dismayed at the catastrophe, im∣mediately surrendered. It was <HI>Sir Ralph</HI>'s fate to survive the day, and afterwards to suffer death as a traitor at <HI>York.</HI></P>
<P>The damages the castle had sustained, were not repaired in that or the succeeding reigns: King Henry VII. and King Henry VIII. both esteemed those castles as places of refuge only for malecontents. From the time of King Edward IV. there is a total suspension of its history. By the escheats of the 10th of Queen Elizabeth, it appears to be in the Crown, with the adjoining castle of <HI>Dunstanburgh. Sir John Foster</HI> of <HI>Bambrough Abbey,</HI> was then Governor of this castle. His grandson, <HI>John Foster, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR></HI> had a grant of the manor of <HI>Bambrough</HI> from King James; but in the year 1715, his descendant forfeited, and it was purchased by his uncle, <HI>Lord Crew.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>I am indebted to Ralph Spearman, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> of Eachwick, in the county of Northumberland, for the following curious survey, taken by inquisition, of this castle, its rights and liberties.</P>

The Cee Towne, there is at this day no place or towne of that name, that we can know, unlesse that be menie of the towne of Bamburghe, which is scituate not far from the foresaid castle, on the west parte thereof, and hath been a borough and market towne, but now not frequented with market, but in manner decayed, and the most parte thereof desolate and unbielded. The Lordshippe is reputed to be the antient inheritance of the crowne and antient demayne, and hath the liber∣ties, royalties, privileges, and services belonging thereto, and antiently have used the same; and the tenants of certain towns there, as of Bamburgh, Shoston, and Sunderland are not em∣pleaded, nor doe not few for that inheritance, but onely in the courts there, and have their courts kept at certain customable days accordinglie. There is belonging to the said castle the demain lands of Bamburghe, demain lands at Sunderland, the towns or hamlets of Bedenhall, Shoston, and Sunderland, all which be reputed as the upper Lordshipp belonging to the said castle. And besides the payment of the rents in money and grains mentioned in the next article following, they or some of them perfectly there known, doe owe by their tenure and by custome certaine services to the said castle, as the casting away of sand and clenging the castle thereof, certaine daysworks of husband labour for occupation and manuring of the said demayne lands; and alsoe that every two tenants should bring every year one carte load of wood from Roch∣wood, and one foother of turves from the Kings Moore to said castle, to be spent with certaine other accustomable services: to the said castle alsoe belongeth a certaine peace of ground, which as it semeth hath beene inclosed, because there remaineth yet about it the mencon where the ditch hath bene, called by the name of Rotchwood, where great woods hath beene, but now utterly decayed, and noe wood at all remaineth thereon: there is alsoe certaine other townes, as Bewicke, Dichburne, Calvele, Eslingtone, Yetlingtone, Midletone, Midle Midletone, North Midletone, South Mowlflen, and Bedenhall, which pay yearly severall rents unto the said

Sir Henry Spel∣man re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ites several records, wherein these words had occurred to him, and conjectures upon the whole, that the Drenges were free tenants holding by military service.

And of these Roger had great use at Brougham; for of him the Countess of Pembroke's Memoirs take notice, that he was a lover of building, and a great repairer of his ancient castles, the seats of his ancestors. They seem to have been tenants in pure villenage, who were bound to the Lord as members of and annexed to the manor, and were usually sold with the farm to which they belonged.</Q></P>

founder; this edifice seems to be of much more modern date. In a nich in the wall is a recumbent effigy of a Knight Templar, the per∣sonage represented unknown. As these apertures on the building of churches were designed for the tombs of founders or other benefactors, this tomb reduces the antiquity of the church to a late aera; and indeed the whole building has that appearance. Unless we conceive the out∣works of the fortifications of Bambrough were of great extent, it is not reconcileable that this should be the church founded by King Oswald.</P>

<P><PB N="174" REF="179"/>It is necessary in this place to take a particular view of the charity of <HI>Lord Crew,</HI> who purchased the forfeited estates of the Fosters.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>In Mr Randal's Manuscripts it is stated, that <Q>Bambrough was afterwards granted to his grandson, Claudius Forster, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> Mar. 15, 7 King James I. Dorothy the only child of William Forster, Knt. marrying Nathaniel Lord Crewe, Bishop of Durham, and Baron of Steane in the county of Northampton, July 23, 1700, brought with her the estates of Bam∣brough and Blanchland. She died without issue.</Q></P>
<P>"His Lordship left by will, dated June 24th, 1720, the said estates to charitable uses.</P>
<P><Q>There are several good rooms furnished in the tower. Dr R. Trevor, Bishop of Durham, held a confirmation at Bambrough, on Sunday August 10th, 1766, for that parish, and dined with Dr. Sharp at the castle, in the large room where the manor court is held</Q></P>
<BIBL>Randal's Man.</BIBL></NOTE> It is not arrogant to say, that his bequests have furnished the most exalted degree of charitable distribution, that ever flowed from a private do∣nation in this country.</P>
<P>Lord Crew's will bears date the 24th June, 1720, and he died the 18th of September, in the 88th year of his age, at Stene, the seat of his ancestors, in Northamptonshire. The appropriations which parti∣cularly relate to <HI>Bambrough,</HI> are the sole objects of my present atten∣tion. I cannot describe them to the reader in more expressive language, than that of the worthy and learned traveller Mr Pennant; from whose works I will select a few sentences.</P>
<P><Q>The castle, and the manor belonging it, was once the property of the Forsters; but purchased by Lord Crew, Bishop of Durham, and with other considerable estates, left vested in Trustees, to be applied to unconfined charitable uses. Three of these Trustees are a majo∣rity:
<PB N="175" REF="180"/>
one <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. Sharp.</NOTE> of them makes this place his residence, and blesses the coast by his judicious and humane application of the Prelate's gene∣rous bequest. He has repaired and rendered habitable the great square tower: the part reserved for himself and family, is a large hall and a few smaller apartments; but the rest of the spacious edifice is allotted for purposes, which make the heart to glow with joy when thought of. The upper part is an ample granary; from whence corn is dispensed to the poor without distinction, even in the dearest time, at the rate of four shillings a bushel; and the distressed, for many miles round, often experience the conveniency of this benefaction.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Other apartments are fitted up for shipwrecked sailors, and bedding is provided for 30, should such a number happen to be cast on shore at the same time. A constant patrol is kept every stormy night along this tempestuous coast, for above 8 miles, the length of the manor, by which means numbers of lives have been preserved. Many poor wretches are often found on the shore in a state of insensibility; but by timely relief, are soon brought to themselves.</Q></P>
<P><Q>It often happens, that ships strike in such a manner on the rocks as to be capable of relief, in case numbers of people could be sud∣denly assembled: for that purpose a cannon <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Once belonging to a Dutch frigate of 40 guns, which with all the crew was lost opposite to the castle, about 60 years ago.</NOTE> is fixed on the top of the tower, which is fired once, if the accident happens in such a quar∣ter; twice, if in another; and thrice, if in such a place. By these signals the country people are directed to the spot they are to fly to; and by this means, frequently preserve not only the crew, but even the vessel; for machines of different kinds are always in readiness to heave ships out of their perilous situation.</Q></P>
<P><Q>In a word, all the schemes of this worthy Trustee have a humane and useful tendency: he seems as if selected from his brethren for the same purposes as Spenser tells us the first of his seven beadsmen in the house of holinesse was.</Q></P>
<Q><L>The first of them that eldest was and best,</L>
<L>Of all the house had charge and government,</L>

<HEAD>An Account of the Signals made use of at Bambrough Castle, in the county of Northumber∣land, in case ships or vessels are perceived in distress, and of the charitable institutions estab∣lished there for their assistance and relief, now published by the direction of the Trustees of Nathanael late Lord Crewe, with the approbation of the Master, Pilots, and Seamen of the Trinity-house in Newcastle upon Tyne.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">SIGNALS.</HEAD>
<P N="1">I. A gun (a nine-pounder) placed at the bottom of the tower, to be fired as a signal in case any ship or vessel be observed in distress, viz. once, when any ship or vessel is stranded or wrecked upon the islands, or any adjacent rock: twice, when any ship or vessel is stranded or wrecked behind the castle, or to the northward of it: thrice, when any ship or vessel is stranded or wrecked to the southward of the castle; in order that the custom-house officers, and the te∣nants with their servants, may hasten to give all possible assistance—as well as to prevent the wreck from being plundered.</P>
<P N="2">II. In every great storm, two men on horseback are sent from the castle to patrol along the coast, from sun-set to sun-rise, that, in case of an accident, one may remain by the ship, and other return to alarm the castle. Whoever brings the first notice of any ship or vessel being in distress, is intitled to a premium, in proportion to the distance from the castle; and if between twelve o'clock at night and three o'clock in the morning, the premium to be double.</P>
<P N="3">III. A large flag is hoisted, when there is any ship or vessel seen in distress upon the Fern Islands, or Staples, that the sufferers may have the satisfaction of knowing their distress is per∣ceived from the shore, and that relief will be sent them as soon as possible. In case of bad wea∣ther the flag will be kept up, a gun fired morning and evening, and a rocket thrown up every night from the north turret, till such time as relief can be sent. These are also signals to the Holy Island Fishermen, who by the advantage of their situation, can put off for the islands at times when no boat from the main land can get over the breakers. Premiums are given to the first boats that put off for the islands, to give their assistance to ships or vessels in distress, and provisions and liquors are sent in the boats.</P>
<P N="4">IV. A bell on the south turret will be rung out in every thick fog, as a signal to the fishing boats; and a large swivel fixed on the east turret will be fired every fifteen minutes, as a signal to the ships without the islands.</P>
<P N="5">V. A large weather-cock is fixed on the top of the flag-staff, for the use of the pilots.</P>
<P N="6">VI. A large speaking trumpet is provided, to be used when ships are in distress near the shore, or are run aground.</P>
<P N="7">VII. An observatory or watch tower is made on the east turret of the castle, where a person is to extend every morning at day-break during the winter season, to look out if any ships be in distress.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. Masters and Commanders of ships or vessels in distress, are desired to make such sig∣nals as are usually made by people in their melancholy situation.</P>
<P>Assistance, Stores, and Provisions, prepared at Bambrough Castle for Seamen, Ships or Vessels, wrecked or driven a-shore on that coast or neighbourhood.</P>
<P N="1">I. Rooms and beds are prepared for seamen, ship-wrecked, who will be maintained in the castle for a week (or longer, according to circumstances) and during that time be found with all manner of necessaries.</P>
<P N="2">II. Cellars for wine and other liquors from ship-wrecked vessels, in which they are to be de∣posited for one year, in order to be claimed by the proper owners.</P>
<P N="3">III. A store-house ready for the reception of wrecked goods, cables, rigging, and iron. A book is kept for entering all kinds of timber and other wrecked goods, giving the marks and description of each, with the date when they came on shore.</P>
<P N="4">IV. Four pair of screws for raising ships that are stranded, in order to their being repaired. —Timber, blocks and tackles, handspokes, cables, ropes, pumps and iron, ready for the use of ship-wrecked vessels.</P>
<P>N. B. But if taken away, to be paid for at prime cost.</P>
<P N="5">V. A pair of chains with large rings and swivels, made on purpose for weighing ships (of a thousand tons burthen) that are sunk upon rocks, or in deep water.</P>
<P>N. B. These chains are to be lent (gratis) to any person having occasion for them, within forty or fifty miles along the coast, on giving proper security to re-deliver them to the Trustees.</P>
<P N="6">VI. Two mooring chains of different lengths are provided, which may occasionally be joined together, when a greater length is required.</P>
<P N="7">VII. Whenever any dead bodies are cast on shore, coffins, &amp;c. will be provided, gratis, and also the funeral expences paid.</P>

<P>So extensive a charity, to flow from a private bounty, is singular: men in former ages were canonized for trifling acts of benevolence, compared to this. But although the resources were given by Lord Crew, yet the disposition was not of his arrangement; to the benevo∣lent heart of <HI>the Rev. Dr Sharp,</HI> the chief part of the blessings derived from his Lordship's will is to be attributed. He resides many months in each year in <HI>the castle of Bambrough,</HI> superintends the works of charity, has his eye open upon every new channel by which he may give relief or consolation to his suffering fellow-creatures. The shipwrecked and the diseased are comforted by his visitation, and the calamities of life
<PB N="179" REF="184"/>
are all alleviated by his care. It is an exalted duty; the blessed spirits of heaven are described to us as dispensing the gifts of universal bene∣volence.</P>
<P>In regard to natural strength, there is not a situation in all Northum∣berland equal to that of Bambrough, or one in any wise so well adapted to the ancient rules of fortification. From the great tower there is an extensive sea and land prospect; you overlook the whole group of <HI>Farn Islands;</HI> you view <HI>the castle of Holy Island,</HI> which from thence makes a very formidable appearance; and on the more distant peninsula, you discern the town and fortifications of <HI>Berwick.</HI> On the other side, <HI>Dun∣stanborough Castle</HI> crowns the nearest cliffs, behind which a winding shore is seen, with many little promontories, creeks, and bays, beauti∣fully mingled, and graced with multitudes of small vessels, laying in their ports or under sail. The extreme point of view is <HI>Tynemouth,</HI> whose ruined monastery gives an obelisk to terminate the landskip. All the inland prospect gradually inclines towards the sea banks, with many considerable swells, displaying a fine cultivated scene to the eye, varied with innumerable villages and hamlets.</P>

<HEAD>THE FARN ISLANDS</HEAD>
<P>possess little matter of sufficient consequence to tempt a traveller to sea, especially where there is so constant a ripling and breaking of the waves, as is to be found between them and the continent.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The effect of oil on troubled waters, mentioned lately as a modern and accidental disco∣very, was known in very distant ages: it was practised in this country, and esteemed a miracle. Indeed most of the miraculous works of the religious were deduced from some knowledge of the simplest principles of nature, discovered and displayed in ages of profound ignorance. In Bede's third book of the history of the Church of England, touching the miracles wrought by Aidan, this practice is thus mentioned. <Q>A certain priest named <HI>Utta,</HI> a man of great gra∣vity and sincerity, and one who for his qualities and truth was well esteemed, was commis∣sioned to go into Kent, for <HI>Eanflede,</HI> King <HI>Edwine</HI>'s daughter, who after her father's death had been sent thither, in order to her espousal with King <HI>Oswin.</HI> He was to travel by land to Kent, but to return by sea; on which account he addressed Bishop Aidan, beseeching him to put up fervent prayers to God to prosper their Voyage. The Bishop gave them his bles∣sing, and having recommended them devoutly to the protection of God, he also delivered to Utta some jars of hallowed oil, saying, I foresee that whilst you are at sea, a sudden tempest will come upon you; remember to cast into the troubled waters the oil that I give you, and and speedily the tempest shall be assuaged, the sea be calmed, and you shall have a pleasant passage. All these things were fulfilled according to the prophecy. At the beginning of the tempest, when the waves and surges chiefly raged, the sailors endeavoured in vain to cast anchor; but the storm increased, and the waves multiplied so fast, that the vessel was almost filled with water, and nothing but immediate death presented itself. In this distress the Priest had recourse to the Bishop's directions, and took the pot of oil, some of which he cast into the sea, and the sea was immediately calmed, the sun soon after shone forth, and the ship proceeded with a prosperous voyage. Thus the man of God, through the spirit of pro∣phecy, predicted the tempest, and by the same holy spirit, though he was himself absent, appeased the same.</Q></NOTE> In the month of
<PB N="180" REF="185"/>
August, when we visited the islands, the sea was tumultuous, making a violent inset between them and the main land. They are 17 in num∣ber, the largest and only one we thought worth attending to, is the <HI>House Island,</HI> nearest to <HI>Bambrough,</HI> where <HI>St. Cuthbert</HI> made his resi∣dence. Mr Pennant visited them all, and has the following remarks, which, as the work of a very able Naturalist, highly merit a place here.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>There ly certen isles adjoining to Farne Island, bigger then Farne itself.

<P><Q>Opposite to <HI>Bambrough</HI> lie the <HI>Farn Islands,</HI> which form two groups of little isles and rocks, to the number of 17, but at low water the points of others appear above the surface; they all are distinguished by particular names. The nearest isle to the shore, is that called the <HI>House Island,</HI> which lies exactly one mile 68 chains from the coast: the most distant is about seven or eight miles. They are rented for 16l. per annum: their produce is kelp, some few feathers, and a few seals, which the tenant watches and shoots, for the sake of the oil and skins. Some of them yield a little grass, and serve to feed a cow or two, which the people are desperate enough to transport over in their little boats.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Visited these islands in a coble, a safe but seemingly hazardous species of boat, long, narrow, and flat-bottomed, which is capable of going through a high sea, dancing like a cork on the summits of the waves.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Touched at the rock called <HI>Meg,</HI> whitened with the dung of cor∣vorants, which almost covered it; their nests were large, made of tang, and excessively faetid.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Rowed next to the <HI>Pinnacles,</HI> an island in the farthest group; so called from the vast columnar rocks at the south end, even at their

sides, and flat at their tops, and entirely covered with guillemots and shags: the Fowlers pass from one to the other of these columns by means of a narrow board, which they place from top to top, forming a narrow bridge, over such a horrid gap, that the very sight of it strikes one with terror.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Landed at a small island, where we found the female Eider ducks, at that time fitting: the lower part of their nests was made of sea plants; the upper part was formed of the down which they pull off their own breasts, in which the eggs were surrounded and warmly bedded: in some were three, in others five eggs, of a large size, and pale olive colour, as smooth and glossy, as if varnished over. The nests are built over the beach, among the loose pebbles, not far from the water. The ducks sit very close, nor will they rise till you almost tread on them. The drakes separate themselves from the females du∣ring the breeding season. We robbed a few of their nests of the down, after carefully separating it from the tang, found that the down of one nest weighed only three quarters of an ounce, but was so elastic as to fill the crown of the largest hat. The people of this country call these St. Cuthbert's ducks, from the Saint of the islands.</Q></P>

was a larger house near the landing place, where the brethren who came to visit him lodged. After the death of <HI>St. Cuthbert, Ethelwold,</HI> who took on him the religious habit at <HI>Ripon,</HI> resorted to this hermitage, and possessed it 12 years, ending his life there. <HI>Felgild</HI> succeeded <HI>Ethel∣wold,</HI> and in the time of that Hermit, <HI>Eadfrid</HI> Bishop of Lindisfarn restored from its foundations the oratory of St. Cuthbert, which had gone to ruin. Bede relates, that <HI>Felgild</HI> was more than 70 years old when he wrote the Life of St. Cuthbert. Besides the persons mentioned by Bede, there were other devotees who chose <HI>Farn</HI> for the place of their retreat. <HI>St. Bartholomew</HI> was one, as appears from a manuscript History of his Life in the Bodlean Library, who obtained leave of <HI>Lawrence</HI> Prior of Durham to go to <HI>Farne,</HI> where he found one <HI>Elwyn</HI> in possession of the desirable residence, and whose religion was not suffi∣ciently tempered with charity, to induce him to welcome the stranger. <HI>Bartholomew</HI> wrote in this retreat his Farne Meditations, now preserved in the Durham Library. <HI>Thomas</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Thomas the First succeeded at Farn Isle, A.

The King opposed this election, esteeming him disaffected to his govern∣ment, because he had been Prior of Coldingham, and sworn fealty to the King of Scotland; and there was singular danger in having a Bishop of Durham under any attachment to the King of Scotland, as in right of his See he would possess places of great strength and importance: more particularly he would hold a large tract of sea coast and many havens, where the shipping and troops of France and Flanders might be received. These objections not being esteemed of sufficient impor∣tance to the Monks, for them to renounce their right of election, or fearing new innovations from regal power, they appealed to the See of Rome; but the messengers charged with this matter died in their pas∣sage,

and Melsonby being intercepted as he attempted to leave the king∣dom, he resigned his title to the Episcopacy on the 8th of April, A. D. 1240, having contested his claim three years. In the year 1244, the King advancing towards Newcastle with his army, the Prior was struck with new apprehensions of danger, as he dreaded resentment for the conduct he had shewn under his election to the See; consequently he resigned his office of Prior, and retired to Farn Island, where the Hermit Bartholomew then was in occupation of the sacred cell of St. Cuthbert. Here the Prior spent the remainder of his life in devotion and austerities. He was buried in the cathedral church of Durham, among the Bishops; and many miracles were said to be wrought at his tomb.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Whart. Aug. Sax. v. 1. p. 735.</NOTE></P>

<P>These erections are on the best part of the island; a little lawn skirts the edifices, surrounded with rugged rocks, from whence issues a spring of fresh water. Since the departure of the religious, this island has re∣turned almost to its pristine state: it consists of a few acres in its whole surface, the chief part of which is sand and rock. A scanty herbage takes place indeed in some spots, especially on the little lawn; but there is neither tree or shrub. The shore is rocky, and sounding to the hollow sea which rolls upon it, sends forth a horrid howling: the north-east winds blow fiercely here, and every inclemency of weather known to the climate beats on these inhospitable shores, which are tremendous from frequent shipwrecks.—There is not a coast more likely to give one the idea of shoals of wandering spirits, who visit the <HI>semisepulta Ossa,</HI> over which they loiter on this side Styx, whilst unfriendly whirlwinds wreck them over with sand, and forbid the funeral rites for which they languish.</P>

<BIBL>England's Worthies.</BIBL>
<P>The famous Doctor <HI>Joannes Duns,</HI> alias <HI>Scotus,</HI> lived in the time of <HI>Bishop Lamberton</HI> (he died 1328). He was born in the town of <HI>Duns,</HI> in the county of <HI>Mers,</HI> and being yet a child, after some taste he had got of the Latin tongue, by the perswaision of two Minorite Friars, went to <HI>Oxford,</HI> studying Logic in <HI>Morton College:</HI> then applying himself to scholastic Divinity, grew to such a perfection therein, as he was called the <HI>subtle Doctor;</HI> and was followed of a number, who after his name are called to this day <HI>Scotistae.</HI> After he had professed a while at <HI>Oxford,</HI> he was called to read divinity in the university of <HI>Paris,</HI> and from thence went to <HI>Colon,</HI> where he died of the apoplexy.

In <HI>Colen,</HI> where he might without danger shew of what country he was, he did profess himself a <HI>Scot,</HI> and the <HI>Minorites</HI> (of which order he was) did therefor upon his tomb, erected in their church, at the end of the quire nigh unto the high altar, set this inscription, which is there yet to be seen:

<PB N="188" REF="193"/>
a plain nearly square, consisting of about nine acres. The Keep and interior works, if there ever were any, are totally gone, the plough-share having passed within the walls.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Within the circumference of which there grew not long since 240 Winchester bushels of corn, beside several cart loads of hay.</P>
<BIBL>Gibson's Camden.</BIBL></NOTE> The rocks to the north are per∣pendicular, of a columniary form, about 30 feet in height, black and horrible; the shore rugged, covered with broken rocks woven over with sea-weed. From the edge of the sea cliffs on the north-west point, the western wall runs along the brink of an elevated rock; a square tower arises near the center of this wall, of a considerable height, and of ex∣cellent masonry, placed on a projecting point of the cliff, so as to af∣ford to the armed men within a means of flanking the wall with their missile weapons; on each corner there was an exploratory turret. This seems to be the most modern part of the castle, built of the best mate∣rials, and by the ablest workmen. Where the land rises to the summit of the rock on the south-west point, the wall turns and makes a long straight front to the south, as represented in the plate: the ground be∣fore it is level, and appears to have been assisted by art, to form a more commodious parade for the garrison. In this front there is a gate-way, built in a very remarkable stile, being the great entrance to the castle: it is formed by a circular arch, with a portico and interior gate; is defended by two heavy semicircular towers uniting with the super∣structure of the gate-way: these towers, after rising about 20 feet, and containing two tiers of apartments, support turrets of a square form, now so very rugged and ruinous, as not to allow a conjecture what was their original height. This wall extends to the cliffs on the sea banks, is guarded by two square bastions and a small sally-port, and is termi∣nated by a square tower with a gate-way. On the brink of the cliff to the sea, on this quarter, appear the remains of a very strong wall; indeed it is probable the whole Area was originally so enclosed. The heavy seas which break upon the rocks of the north-west point have torn them much; and it appears as if the area had been originally of greater extent than at present, many separate columns of rock standing near the cliffs, which some ages ago may have been joined to the main land. At the south point of the area is the well: near to the eastern tower are the remains of a chapel. Immediately below this tower is a gully or passage of perpendicular sides, formed in the rocks, about 60 yards in length and 40 feet deep, where the sea makes a dreadful inset, breaking into foam with a tremendous noise: the spray
<PB N="189" REF="194"/>
occasioned thereby is driven within the castle walls. This place is called by the country people <HI>the Rumble Churn.</HI> The gulph, from the walls of the tower, which I ascended to obtain the view, has a very awful appearance: you look immediately down upon the abyss, where, as the tide rushes up, the waters are lifted many feet above the common level, rising towards the walls of the tower, as if they would sur∣mount the cliffs and deluge the plain. The breaking of the waves in foam over the extreme point of the rocks, the heavy spray, the noise of the disturbed waters, and the groan which echo returns through the desolated towers, are noble, though tremendous.</P>
<P>The date of this castle is fixed by authors to the beginning of the 14th century, <HI>Thomas Earl of Lancaster,</HI> General of the confederate army which opposed King Edward II. being said to be the founder. He was also owner of <HI>Pomfret Castle,</HI> where, after being taken by the King's troops at <HI>Burrowbridge,</HI> he was imprisoned, and soon after de∣collated as a traitor; though afterwards he was canonized, and the place of his martyrdom took the name of <HI>St. Thomas's Hill.</HI> He was possessed of immense estates, and was the most powerful and opulent subject in Europe, holding at once the Earldoms of <HI>Lancaster, Lincoln, Salisbury, Leicester, and Darby.</HI> The King sat personally on his trial, a remarkable circumstance: he died 25th March, 1322, and was buried on the south side of the high altar in the priory church there. Such veneration was paid to his tomb, as the enthusiasts wasted on that of Becket. The King of his royal clemency remitted the severities of his sentence, by which he was condemned to be hanged and quartered, an infamy which seldom had fallen on those of royal descent, he being grandson of King Henry III. But so fluctuating are human affairs, that the ignominious exit of this Earl, gave exalted honours to his name after his death: he was enrolled in the list of Martyrs, was canonized, and his portrait placed among those of sacred memory in the cathedral of St. Paul's.</P>

Queen Margaret perceiving that the French succours were too inconsiderable to induce the Northumbrians to rise in her favour, made another voyage, and having borrowed a sum of money and gained a reinforcement of 2000 men, in October, 1462, she landed near <HI>Bambrough.</HI> Her return with those aids did not yet induce the people of Northumberland to take up arms. Through the treachery of Sir Ralph Gray, the castle of <HI>Alnwick</HI> was surrendered to her. Margaret hearing that King Edward was advancing with a numerous army, found it necessary again to seek refuge in Scotland: to this end she embarked, but a violent storm arising, she was in immi∣nent peril, and at length gained the port of <HI>Berwick.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>King Henry, the Duke of Excestre, and the Duke of Somersete, and other Lordes that fled, had kepte Alnewicke, Banborow, Dunstanburgh, Warkworth, and mannid and intailid them.</P>

A Gentleman of an ancient and honourable family, and of the greatest personal worth and merit; an upright and impartial magistrate, and zealously at∣tached to the established government, and to the true interest of his King and country; an af∣fectionate husband, a tender father, a kind master, and a generous landlord; one of the greatest probity and sincerity, and no less conscientious in the discharge of divine than social duties; of a very charitable and beneficent disposition, as appears by the following instances (among many others): Upon the scite of an old decayed church here, he erected a new one of an elegant taste, and not inferior to any of its size in those northern parts, upon which he expended at least 500 l. He laid out 100 l. towards building a convenient school-house, for the use of the poor children of this parish, and to the former salary of 10l. a year for the master, for teach∣ing all the indigent children gratis, he has added the interest of 200l. yearly for the master's better subsistence and encouragement. And besides a liberal distribution to the necessitous of this place and others at his funeral, he has bequeathed the interest of 100l. to be given annu∣ally on his birth-day, for the relief of the indigent inhabitants of the parish. He was endowed with all the amiable qualities which could endear him to mankind in this life, and perpetuate his memory after death to the latest posterity.

<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>THE CASTLE OF ALNWICK.</HEAD>
<P>The situation is not naturally elegant, the aspect being rather confined, and the adjacent lands affording no original beauties. The opposite hills rise tamely, and are not yet brought into such order, as to possess artificial graces enough, to conceal the want of that variety and beauty, which a traveller wishes to find surrounding so noble a palace. The woody banks of the <HI>Aln,</HI> with all the wild romantic scenes which hang upon her borders, are excluded from the prospect. The castle stands upon a fine elevation, rising gradually from the river, whose open banks are turfed and kept in the most exact neatness under the gardener's scythe; but withal, possessing that trim countenance, given by straight lines and angles, level walks, and slopes of a mechanical formality; a
<PB N="194" REF="200"/>
garb in which nature doth not look the most lovely. <HI>The castle</HI> is a noble structure, rebuilt on the old foundation, and in the Saxon style; the architect has strictly preserved the whole modes and ornaments of the original: the battlements are crowded with effigies, according to the taste of the Normans, in whose time it underwent a principal repa∣ration: these represent men in the act of defence, wielding such arms as were then used; some of them are disposed with great propriety, the guard of one of the gate-ways is in the attitude of casting down a mighty stone on the heads of assailants. The building is of a beautiful free-stone, in chisel'd work; its form is singular, being composed of a cluster of semicircular and angular bastions. I cannot, without the ichnography of the place, give the reader a more competent idea of its figure, than by comparing it to a section of the clustered Saxon pillar in our cathedrals. This edifice stands in a spacious area, which at the time of its greatest strength, I presume, totally surrounded it, defended by a compleat circumvallation and a moat; otherwise the principal part of the fortress would have lain unguarded by any outwork, except a moat. At present the front is opened to the north-east, and the wall having towers at proper intervals, shuts it in on the other quarters. As we viewed the castle on our approach, the walls with its towers formed a noble flanking to the principal structure: to the southward, the gar∣den grounds appeared prettily disposed; to the north and west, the town of Alnwick was seen spreading on the back ground. We lamented the want of some of those fine woodlands, and lofty grey rocks, which impend over the Aln, above Alnwick, to give rural and romantic graces to objects so imperial, if I may be permitted to use the expression, in distinguishing this noble edifice.</P>
<P>We passed over an elegant stone bridge, on our approach to the town, the battlements formed of interwoven crescents: we found the Inn crowded with people of fortune, come from all parts of the county, to pay their compliments to the Duke and Duchess,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Her Grace was living when the author made his tour and compiled this work. He should think himself happy, could he compose an Eulogium equal to so eminent and illustrious a cha∣racter.</NOTE> it being their first public day, after their arrival at this palace for the summer recess.</P>
<P>The approach to the castle retains much of the solemn grandeur of ancient times: the inscription on the gate-way still legible, <Q>Esperance
<PB N="195" REF="201"/>
me comforteth,</Q> appertained to the arms of the Percies, and was placed there when the repairs were made by that family: the moat is drained, and the ceremony of letting down the draw-bridge is forgot; but the walls which enclose the area still wear the ancient countenance of strength and defiance. You enter by a machicolated gate, defended by an upper tower, and after passing a covered way, approach the in∣terior gate which admits you to the area: this entrance is defended by all the devices used in ancient times; iron studded gates, portcullis, open galleries, and apertures in the arching for annoying assailants. The ingenious traveller, Mr Pennant, had been out of humour when he vi∣sited this place. We met with all the inconveniences of a noisy and crowded Inn, with every awkward circumstance which could befall tra∣vellers, who had undergone no little fatigue in pursuing the paths of pleasure; and yet we could not submit to coincide with that gentle∣man's sentiments: <Q>You look (says he) in vain, for any marks of the grandeur of the feodal age, for trophies won by a family eminent in our annals for military prowess and deeds of chivalry; for halls hung with helms and hauberks, or with the spoils of the chace; for exten∣sive forests and venerable oaks. Ye look in vain for the helmet on the tower, the ancient signal of hospitality to the traveller, or for the grey-headed Porter, to conduct him to the hall of entertainment. The numerous train whose countenances give welcome to him on his way, are now no more; and instead of the disinterested Usher of the old times, he is attended by a Valet, eager to receive the fees of admit∣tance.</Q> I must beg leave to pronounce, that though the savage fero∣city of the feodal ages is taken away, yet not the marks of grandeur: we saw no miserable dungeons filled with captives, no places of execu∣tion groaning under their execrable burthen; the towers remain, but without the cry of captivity and torture: Hospitality cloathed in princely array, sits in the hall, dispensing with a brow of benignity, mixed with features of the highest magnificence, gifts worthy her hand: the Duke and Duchess are easy of access, and of an affable deportment; their vi∣sitants are happy under their smiles, without being awed by their emi∣nence. The attention they pay to the petitions of dependents, is marked with the greatest benevolence; no vain promises are given to still im∣portunity, no hopes are flattered without sincerity—the strictest honour attends the most trivial actions. A truly great principle distinguishes these noble personages; amidst a happy liberality, there is so exact a propriety, and such perfect oeconomy, that no transaction passes in the household, without a certain rule, and singular regularity. The innu∣merable
<PB N="196" REF="202"/>
charities they pour forth, are bestowed with such admirable propriety, that each person relieved at the gate, brings a ticket as an authority to the officer for the dispensation of his Lord's bounty; so that improper objects cannot deceive, or crafty knaves obtain the por∣tion assigned for the relief of the truly necessitous and meritorious ob∣ject. To enumerate acts of benevolence is inconsistent with my plan, but some are so singularly worthy the world's attention, that I cannot resist the pleasure of relating a single transaction, which on my hearing it, brought tears of joy into my eyes.</P>
<P>Her grace returning from an airing in her chariot, passed through the ranks of people in the gate-ways, who attended to receive a daily distribution to the poor. A widow oppressed with grievous necessity, could not leave her domestic employment, or her labour, to attend with her ticket; she entrusted it to her daughter, a girl about seven years of age, who took her parent's place at the gate. Her Grace observed this girl employed in knitting, whilst all the rest of the indigent group sat with idle hands: she sent a servant to bring the child to her, who received the message with astonishment and apprehension; she followed the mes∣senger with trembling steps, revolving in her mind the supposed offences she had committed, and looking with eyes swimming in tears on the ill-fated work, she held in her hand, as the cause of her Grace's dis∣pleasure. Pale with apprehension of reproof, she approached the Du∣chess; confusion and dread were mixed upon her features, whilst looks of timid innocence lived in her eyes. Her grace perceived the child's distress, but conceived not the cause. When the infant had recollected courage enough to give her the power of expression, she began a faul∣tering and fearful excuse for the supposed crime she had committed, in knitting at the gate: a smile of divine benevolence arose upon the Du∣chess's countenance—simplicity and native innocence have great charms —she was won by the child's sensibility as well as by her industry. The girl was taken from her indigent mother, cloathed and put to school, where she is acquiring those accomplishments, which one day will ad∣vance her above the rank of her humble progenitors.</P>
<P>The inside of this palace is finished in a most splendid taste, every thing (to use Mr Pennant's expression) being compleated with <Q>an in∣compatible elegance.</Q> A particular account of suits of apartments, finished and furnished in the highest manner, would be tedious: the rich variety is for the eye only. The chief descriptions I will borrow

<P><Q>Alnwick Castle contains about five acres of ground within its outer walls, which are flanked with 16 towers and turrets, that now afford a compleat set of offices to the castle, and maintain many of them their original names, as well as their ancient use and destination.</Q></P>
<P>"These are,</P>
<P N="1"><Q>I. The Great or Outward Gate of entrance, anciently called the Utter Ward.</Q></P>
<P N="2"><Q>II. The Garner or Avener's Tower: behind which are the stables, coach-houses, &amp;c. in all respects suitable to the magnitude and dig∣nity of this great castle.</Q></P>
<P N="3"><Q>III. The Water Tower; containing the cistern or reservoir that sup∣plies the castle and offices with water. Adjoining to this is the laun∣dry, &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P N="4"><Q>IV. The Caterer's Tower; adjoining to which are the kitchens, and all conveniencies of that sort.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Behind the adjacent walls are concealed a compleat set of offices and apartments for most of the principal officers and attendants in the castle. Together with a large hall, or dining-room, to entertain the tenants at the audits; with an office for the auditors, house∣keeper's room; and underneath these, a servants-hall, with all other suitable conveniencies.</Q></P>
<P N="5">"V. The Middle Ward.</P>
<P N="6">"VI. The Auditor's Tower.</P>
<P N="7">"VII. The Guard House.</P>
<P N="8"><PB N="204" REF="210"/>"VIII. The East Garret.</P>
<P N="9"><Q>IX. The Record's Tower; of which the lower story contains the evidence room, or great repository of the archives of the barony; over it is a circular apartment designed and executed with great taste and beauty for a banquetting room, being 29 feet diameter, and 24 feet 6 inches high.</Q></P>
<P N="10"><Q>X. The Ravine Tower, or Hotspur's Chair. Between this and the round tower was formerly a large breach in the walls, which for time immemorial had been called by the town's people, the Bloody Gap.</Q></P>
<P N="11"><Q>XI. The Constable's Tower; which remains chiefly in its ancient state, as a specimen how the castle itself was once fitted up.</Q></P>
<P N="12"><Q>XII. The Postern Tower, or Sally Port. The upper apartment now contains old armour, arms, &amp;c. The lower story has a small furnace and elaboratory for chymical or other experiments.</Q></P>
<P N="13">"XIII. The Armourer's Tower.</P>
<P N="14">"XIV. The Falconer's Tower.</P>
<P N="15"><Q>XV. The Abbot's Tower; so called either from its situation nearest to Alnwick Abbey, or from its containing an apartment for the Abbot of that monastery whenever he retired to the castle.</Q></P>
<P N="16">"XVI. The West Garret.</P>
<P><Q>The castle properly consists of three courts or divisions; the en∣trance into which was defended with three strong massy gates; called the Utter Ward, the Middle Ward, and the Inner Ward. Each of these gates was in a high embattled tower, furnished with a port∣cullis, and the outward gate with a draw-bridge also: they had each of them a porter's lodge, and a strong prison, besides other necessary apartments for the constable, bailiff, and subordinate officers. Under each of the prisons was a deep and dark dungeon, into which the more refractory prisoners were let down with cords, and from which there was no exit but through the trap door in the floor above. That of the inner ward is still remaining in all its original horrors.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="205" REF="211"/><Q>This castle, like many others in the north, was anciently orna∣mented with figures of warriors, distributed round the battlements, and therefore the present noble proprietors have allowed them to be continued, and have supplied some that had been destroyed, but to shew what they once were; and, that this is no innovation, they have retained the ancient ones, though defaced, which were placed on the top of the two octagon towers.</Q></P>
<P><Q>From length of time, and the shocks it has sustained in ancient wars, this castle was become quite a ruin, when by the death of Al∣gernon Duke of Somerset, it devolved, together with all the estates of this great barony, &amp;c. to the present Duke and Duchess of Northum∣berland; who immediately set to repair the same, and with the most consummate taste and judgment restored and embellished it, as much as possible, in the true Gothic style; so that it may deservedly be considered as one of the noblest and most magnificent models of a great baronial castle.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Nothing can be more striking than the effect at first entrance within the walls from the town, when through a dark gloomy gateway of considerable length and depth, the eye suddenly emerges into one of the most splendid scenes that can be imagined; and is presented at once with the great body of the inner castle, surrounded with fair semi-circular towers, finely swelling to the eye, and gayly adorned with pinnacles, figures, battlements, &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The impression is still further strengthened by the successive en∣trance into the second and third courts, thro' great massy towers, till the stranger is landed in the inner court, in the very center of this great citadel.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Here he enters to a most beautiful stair-case, of a very singular yet pleasing form, expanding like a fan: the cornice of the ceiling is in∣riched with a series of 120 escutcheons, displaying the principal quar∣terings and intermarriages of the Percy family. The space occupied by this stair-case is 46 feet long, 35 feet 4 inches wide, and 43 feet 2 inches high.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The first room that presents to the left, is the saloon, which is a most beautiful apartment, designed in the gayest and most elegant
<PB N="206" REF="212"/>
style of Gothic architecture; being 42 feet 8 inches long, 37 feet 2 inches wide, and 19 feet 10 inches high.</Q></P>
<P><Q>To this succeeds the drawing-room, consisting of one large oval, with a semicircular projection, or bow-window. It is 46 feet 7 inches long, 35 feet 4 inches wide, and 22 feet high.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Hence the transition is very properly to the great dining room; which was one of the first executed, and is of the purest Gothic, with nitches and other ornaments, that render it a very noble model of a great Baron's hall. In this room was an irregularity in the form, which has been managed with great skill and judgment, and made productive of beauty and convenience. This was a large bow-window, not in the center, but towards the upper end, which now affords a very agreeable recess when the family dine alone, or for a second table at the great public dinners. This room is 53 feet 9 inches long, 20 feet 10 inches wide, (exclusive of the circular recess, which is 19 feet in diameter) and 26 feet 9 inches high.</Q></P>
<P><Q>From the dining-room, the stranger may either descend into the court, by a circular Stair-case, or he is ushered into a very beautiful Gothic apartment over the gateway, commonly used for a breakfast or supper-room: this is furnished with closets in the octagon towers, and is connected with other private apartments. It is 38 feet 4 inches long, . . feet wide, and 16 feet 1 inch high.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Hence the stranger is conducted into the library, which is a very fine room, in the form of a parallelogram, properly fitted up for books, and ornamented with stucco-work in a very rich Gothic style; being 64 feet long, . . wide, and 16 feet 1 inch high. This apart∣ment leads to</Q></P>
<P><Q>The chapel; which fills all the upper space of the middle ward. Here the highest display of Gothic ornaments in the greatest beauty has been very properly exhibited; and the several parts of the chapel have been designed after the most perfect models of Gothic excel∣lence. The great east window is taken from one of the finest in York minster. The ceiling is borrowed from that of King's college, in Cam∣bridge; and the walls are painted after the great church in Milan: but the windows of painted glass will be in a stile superior to any thing that has yet been attempted, and worthy of the present more im∣proved
<PB N="207" REF="213"/>
state of the arts. Exclusive of a beautiful circular recess for the family the chapel is 50 feet long, 21 feet, 4 inches wide, and 22 feet high.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Returning from the chapel through the library, and passing by another great stair-case, (that fills an oval space 22 feet 9 inches long, and 15 feet 3 inches wide) we enter a passage or gallery which leads to two great state-bed chambers, each 30 feet long, most nobly fur∣nished, with double dressing rooms, closets, and other conveniencies, all in the highest elegance and magnificence, but as conformable as possible to the general stile of the castle. From these bed-chambers the passage opens to the grand stair-case, by which we first entered, and compleats a tour not easily to be paralleled.</Q></P>
<P>I must now turn my attention to the antiquity and history of this place.</P>
<P>Mr Grose says, <Q>it is believed to have been founded in the time of the Romans, although no part of the original structure is now re∣maining. But when part of the dungeon or castle keep was taken down to be repaired some years ago, under the present walls were discovered the foundations of other buildings, which lay in a diffe∣rent direction from the present; and some of the stones appeared to have Roman mouldings. "The dungeon or keep of the present castle, is believed to have been founded in the Saxon times. The zigzag fret-work round the arch that leads into the inner court, is evidently of Saxon architecture; and yet this was probably not the most an∣cient entrance; for under the flag tower, before that part was taken down and rebuilt by the present Duke, was the appearance of a gate∣way that had been walled up; directly fronting the present outward gateway into the town."</Q></P>

<P>King William Rufus, being required by King Malcolm of Scotland to fulfil the articles concluded upon in the truce made in 1091, gave the Scotch Monarch assurances of their completion, upon his repairing to his court, to which he ordered him to be honourably conducted. On his arrival, he was received with great insolence and contempt, being refused admittance to the King's presence, who insisted that Malcolm should submit his claim to the judgment of the English peers. Malcolm with a becoming dignity refused, alledging if there was any dispute to his title, it should be settled on the Marches, by men of both nations, agreeable to the laws and customs established there. The English Mo∣narch not consenting to such proposition, Malcolm returned in high displeasure, and was not long before he shewed his resentment, by en∣tering the borders with a powerful army, accompanied by Edward his

son: they laid waste the county of Northumberland to the environs of Alnwick, and besieged the castle. The most authentic account of the tragical events of this siege, seems to be that given in the ancient Chro∣nicle of Alnwick Abbey, of which a copy is preserved in the British Museum. Mowbray <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>A. D. 1093. Rex Scottorum Malcholmus, &amp; primogenitus ejus filius Edwardus, cum multis aliis in Northumbria die S.

It was too strong to be taken by assault, but a circumvallation being made by the Scotch forces, the garrison was cut off from hopes of succour, and was on the point of surrendering, when a person undertook its re∣lief by the following stratagem: he rode forth compleatly armed, with the keys of the castle tied to the end of his spear, and presented himself in a suppliant manner before the King's pavilion, as being come to sur∣render the fortress. Malcolm advancing hastily without his armour, re∣ceived a mortal wound from the spearman, who escaped by the fleet∣ness of his horse, and by swimming the river, which was then flooded with rains.

<P>In the year 1135, King David I. of Scotland seized upon the castles of Northumberland, <HI>Alnwick</HI> being one, previous to the treaty entered into between him and King Stephen.</P>
<P>After King William of Scotland, sirnamed the Lion, made his dis∣graceful retreat from the castle of <HI>Prudhoe,</HI> A. D. 1174, he beset the castle of <HI>Alnwick</HI> with his whole army, consisting of 80,000 men: be∣ing repulsed for some time, he formed a blockade, and drew off many of his forces in plundering parties, to pillage the country; one of which, as Benedict of Peterborough says, commanded by Earl <HI>Duncan,</HI> entered the town of <HI>Warkworth,</HI> burnt it, and put all the inhabitants to the sword, without distinction of age or sex; and that he made his soldiers break open the church of St Lawrence in that place, in which,
<PB N="213" REF="219"/>
and in the house of the Minister, they flew above one hundred men, bedsies women and children. <HI>Bernard Baliol,</HI> a youth of great forti∣tude, with about 400 horsemen raised at Newcastle, engaged in an en∣terprize to surprize the Scotch Monarch: they were favoured in their march by a thick fog, which kept them concealed till they reached the environs of Alnwick, when discovering the King attended by about 60 of his chief followers on a reconnoitering party, they came upon them unexpectedly on Saturday the 5th day of July, whilst the principal parts of his vast army were scattered over the country in acts of rapine and violence, and the others laying in an idle and unsuspicious security before the castle, a conflict ensued, in which the King's horse was killed under him, and many of his attendants were slain, the King being made prisoner. The straggling parties were put to the route or taken, to a great amount in number, before they gained intelligence of the real force of their opponents: and the King of those robbers, after being confined some time in Richmond Castle, was removed to London, and afterwards ransomed for 100,000l. at the same time doing homage for his crown: as a memorial of which submission, he deposited his arms at the altar in York Minster.</P>
<P>In the reign of King John, A. D. 1212, <HI>Eustace de Vesey</HI> being accused of a conspiracy against the King's life, fled into Scotland. His castle was ordered to be rased; but the apprehension of a southern rebellion diverted the purpose.</P>
<P><HI>Eustace</HI> with the northern Barons, A. D. 1216, at <HI>Felton</HI> did homage to Alexander II. King of Scotland, his brother-in-law, which so much incensed King John, that he poured forth into the north a large army, laid <HI>Felton</HI> in ashes, together with the towns of <HI>Mitford, Morpeth, Aln∣wick, Wark,</HI> and <HI>Roxburgh.</HI> Whilst John made these dreadful depreda∣tions in Northumberland, the Lord <HI>Eustace,</HI> with King Alexander, made an incursion as far as <HI>Barnardcastle,</HI> in the country of Durham, to which they laid siege; and being out on horseback, to take a view of the for∣tress, in order to plan an assault, making too near an approach, <HI>Eustace</HI> lost his life by an arrow shot from some of the out-posts.</P>
<P>What greatly contributed to prolong the intestine troubles of Henry the Third's kingdom in 1266, was the despair of the rebel Barons, by the forfeitures of their estates, under the determinations of the parlia∣ment of Winchester. <HI>John de Vesey</HI> was one of them, and having been
<PB N="214" REF="220"/>
deprived of his castle and barony of Alnwick, he entered into a combi∣nation with several others labouring under the same proscription, for the recovery of their possessions. <HI>Vesey</HI> raised a sufficient force to gain his castle, but Prince Edward coming against him with a strong body of forces, reduced his garrison to such distress, that he was obliged to surrender, and submit himself to the Prince's mercy; through whose intercession he received the royal pardon.</P>
<P>In 1264, this <HI>John de Vesey</HI> was summoned to parliament in the 28th year of King Henry the Third's reign. This was the glorious aera in which our mode of parliaments was first settled, and Commons regu∣larly admitted to a share in the legislative power. He died in the 11th year of the reign of King Edward I. And in the 25th year of that reign, A. D. 1297, died <HI>William de Vesey,</HI> the last Baron of that family; who having no ligitimate issue, but leaving a son born out of wedlock, did, by the King's licence, enfeof <HI>Anthony Beck,</HI> Bishop of Durham and ti∣tular Patriarch of Jerusalem, in the castle and Barony of Alnwick, in trust for such natural son; but this Right Reverend Guardian got the infant deprived of his barony, and as he acquired other royal favours, also obtained a confirmation from the King of a sale made thereof to Henry Lord Percy, Baron of Topcliff and Spofford, in Yorkshire, an ancestor of the present illustrious family.</P>
<P>Mr Grose says, but from what authority he is not pleased to point out, <Q>that the appointment of the infant's Guardians, as also the very words of the deed of enfeofment (now extant) in which the convey∣ance is to the Bishop absolute and unconditional, confute a report too hastily taken up by some Historians, that this castle and barony were only given to the Bishop in trust for William the Bastard above men∣tioned; and that he was guilty of a violation of this trust in disposing of them otherwise.</Q> It would have been well if Mr Grose could have shewn where this deed was to be seen; as it would in some measure have exonerated the Bishop's memory of this infamous charge, and would have set Historians right for the future. Rymer (III. 184—18-9) au∣thorizes the contrary determination. I do not remember an instrument of that antiquity, which contains an express trust; but where a trust was premised, it was merely confidential, or expressed in some separate deed. Trusts were introduced by the Lawmen to evade the statute of uses made in the reign of King Henry VIII. and from that period gained their legal acceptation.</P>
<P><PB N="215" REF="221"/>The castle and barony of Alnwick continued in the Bishop's possession 12 years,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Grose.</NOTE> before he granted them to Lord Percy. The Bishop's deed bears date the 19th of Nov. 1309, and doth not indeed wear the counte∣nance of an obscure transaction, for the witnesses to it were some of the greatest personages in the kingdom, viz. Henry Lacy Earl of Lincoln, Robert de Umfreville Earl of Angus, Robert Lord Clifford, &amp;c. the grant was afterwards confirmed by the King at Sheene, 23d Jan. 1310, to H. Percy and his sons; who Mr Grose says, <Q>to remove every pre∣tence of complaint, obtained a release of all right and title to the in∣heritance from the heir at law, <HI>Sir Gilbert de Aton,</HI> Knt. who was the nearest legitimate relation to the Lord <HI>William de Vesey</HI> above men∣tioned.</Q> I must confess Mr Grose's argument with me tends not to exculpate the Bishop, but to confirm the suspicion of his guilt. Such a ratification of title, in my apprehension, tells a consciousness of defects: had the bastard son confirmed, the doubt would have been taken away.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P>Antoninus de Bek, &amp;c.</P>

men at arms: he possessed the castle of Alnwick, which was soon after besieged by Lord Hastings, Sir Ralph Gray, and Sir John Howard. The garrison was reduced to great distress, when George Douglas, Earl of Angus, influenced to this service by great promises from Margaret, advanced unexpectedly to the besiegers with 10,000 horsemen, and making such manoeuvres as induced the English army to apprehend he meant to attack them, whilst they were forming themselves in order of battle, he brought a strong party up to the postern gate, to whom the garrison made a sally, and being mounted on horses brought for that purpose, or behind the armed horsemen, the small garrison evacuated the fortress, being only 300 in number, and fled without bloodshed. It is believed the garrison, before they retired, endeavoured to destroy all the arms and ammunition they could not carry off: for a few years ago, on opening the principal well in the inner ward, which had been long filled up, the workmen found in it a great number of cannon balls of a large size, such as were chiefly used after the first invention of gun∣powder.</P>
<P>Margaret, in the month of October following, making another ef∣fort, by the treachery of Sir Ralph Gray, the Governor, was again put in possession of <HI>Alnwick Castle:</HI> but King Edward soon approaching with a numerous army, and finding no forces in the field to oppose him, Margaret having again retired into Scotland, he laid siege to the three great fortresses of <HI>Alnwick, Dunstanborough,</HI> and <HI>Bambrough,</HI> at the same time. The troops which invested <HI>Alnwick,</HI> being 10,000 in num∣ber, were under the command of the Earl of Warwick, the Earl of Kent, the Lord Powis, the Baron of Graystock, and Lord Cromwell. <HI>Alnwick</HI> held out till the 6th of January; the French General <HI>Brezé</HI> having made an ineffectual effort to relieve it.</P>

He was appointed Lord Marshal of England, which office he retained at the coronation of King Richard II. when he was created (16 July, 1377) <HI>Earl of Nor∣thumberland.</HI> Soon afterwards he grievously revenged the slaughter made by the Earl of Dunbar at <HI>Roxburgh;</HI> having levied an army of 10,000 men, he ravaged the territories of that Earl for three successive days, burning and slaying conformable to the savage customs of the age. Under the influence of the Duke of Lancaster, who had expressed an inveterate hatred to him, he was accused of neglect of duty, wherein the Scots had surprized <HI>Berwick,</HI> and judgment of death and loss of estate was pronounced against him: but this severe sentence was re∣mitted by the King, and he soon recovered that fortress. The Earl of Northumberland having suffered many unmerited indignities from the King, entered into an association for his deposition: messengers were accordingly sent to <HI>Henry Duke of Lancaster,</HI> son of John of Gaunt, who was then in France, to invite him over; and he taking advantage of Richard's being in Ireland, with a few attendants, landed in the month of July, 1399, in Holdernesse, Yorkshire, where he was received by the Earl of Northumberland, Sir Henry Percy his son, the Earl of Westmoreland, and many other persons of great power, with a consi∣derable body of men, which in a few days was augmented to 60,000. The succeeding event is so notorious, that it requires no place here. The Earl of Northumberland was appointed Envoy to Richard, by whose argument he was persuaded to resign a royalty of which nothing remained but the name, the defection being so general, that he had not

A parliament was called to meet on the feast of St. Michael, when Richard was solemnly deposed, and Duke Henry having heard read the articles of royal charge by the Archbishop, the same were signed by him with the sign of the cross; and the Earl of Nor∣thumberland being High Constable of England, taking the ring with which the Kings were wedded to the realm, shewed it to the whole as∣sembly, and then put it on the Duke's finger; after which the Duke kissed the Earl, as he had before done the Archbishop, and immediately he was proclaimed King, by the name of Henry IV. The Earl received appointment of the high office of <HI>Constable of England</HI> for life, with a grant of the <HI>Isle of Man,</HI> and many other great dignities and eminent employments.

before the battle; on receiving intelligence of the ill success of his party, he retreated to his castle of Warkworth; from whence being summoned by the King, he surrendered himself, and obtained royal clemency for life, but was divested of his estates and kept prisoner till the commotions subsided, when he received restitution of ho∣nours and lands, the Isle of Man excepted. This restoration was at∣tended with a great solemnity, in the presence of the assembled estates of the kingdom. The Commons gave thanks to the King in full par∣liament for the favour shewn to the Earl of Northumberland. The same day, at their request, the King commanded the Earls of Northum∣berland and Westmoreland, in token of perfect amity, to kiss each other in open parliament, and to take each other by the hand thrice; which they did. The same ceremony passed between the Earls of Nor∣thumberland and Dunbar, on the 22d February then following. But the death of <HI>Hotspur,</HI> and the neglect shewn the Earl of Northumber∣land from the Crown, enraged him so much, that in the succeeding year he openly joined the northern malcontents, and again took up arms against the King. The royal army soon appeared in the north, seized the Earl's castles of <HI>Alnwick</HI> and <HI>Warkworth,</HI> and drove the party to seek refuge in Scotland. A scheme was projected to surrender up this turbulent Earl, but he gaining intelligence of the design, escaped, and afterwards levied a sufficient force to enter England, and recover his castles: these prosperous circumstances were soon succeeded by a total overthrow at the battle of <HI>Bramham Moor,</HI> on the 2d of March, 8th King Henry IV. A. D. 1403, in which the Earl was slain.

<P><HI>Henry Hotspur,</HI> Lord Percy, shewed in his early youth a martial dis∣position. At the coronation of King Richard II. when his father was created Earl, he received the order of Knighthood. In the ninth year of that reign he was made Governor of <HI>Berwick,</HI> and Warden of the Marches towards Scotland; in which office he was so active, that the Scotch gave him the title of <HI>Hotspur.</HI> In the same year he was sent to <HI>Calais,</HI> where he testified his valour. In the 11th year of the same reign he was elected Knight of the Garter: but being envied at court for the military fame he had acquired, his adversaries who had gained the So∣vereign's ear, prevailed to get him an appointment at sea to repel the <HI>French,</HI> who threatened an invasion: in which he acquitted himself with great honour.

From thence the victorious Queen marched south∣ward, and on Shrove Tuesday, at <HI>St. Albans,</HI> obtained a victory over the forces under the Duke of Norfolk, the Earl of Warwick, and others who were left to govern the King. By this event he regained his li∣berty; but finding great levies drawing forwards from all quarters in support of Edward, the King with his party prudently retreated to the north. Edward having been proclaimed King by his partizans, by the name of King Edward IV. left London on the 12th of March, leading forth a powerful army to pursue the unfortunate Henry in his re∣treat, and by easy marches arrived at <HI>Pomfret,</HI> where he rested the troops for some time, appointing the Lord Fitz Walter to keep the pass of <HI>Ferrybridge.</HI> The Earl of Northumberland, desirous of revenging the death of those whom he dearly loved, was well prepared to receive his enemies; and leaving King Henry with his Queen and son in the city of <HI>York,</HI> for their greater safety, it was resolved that <HI>Ferrybridge</HI> at all hazards should be recovered, and the enterprize was committed to the Lord Clifford; who with a competent number of light horsemen departing early from the army on the morning preceding Palm Sunday, made such expedition that he surprized the guard, which he put to the sword, and gained the bridge. The Lord Fitz Walter hearing the noise, rose out of his bed, as did the bastard brother of the Earl of Warwick, presuming there was a mutiny among the soldiers, but soon fell victims to the arms of Clifford. On this Edward thinking loss of time might endanger the rest of his forces, resolved to try his fate, by the imme∣diate issue of a battle. Finding the pass of <HI>Ferrybridge</HI> too well main∣tained

to be attempted, he ordered the van-guard of his army to ford the river three miles above, as Castleford; and attacking the Lord Clif∣ford near <HI>Towton,</HI> as he was retreating to the main army, surrounded his party, who defended themselves with great bravery till his Lordship was slain, being shot with an arrow through the throat.</P>
<P>Next day being Palm Sunday, 29th of March, both armies were within sight of each other between <HI>Saxton</HI> and <HI>Towton;</HI> King Henry's forces being computed at 60,000, and King Edward's at 48,660.

Hall says he outdid them <Q>for the richness of his coat, being goldsmiths work garnished with pearle and stones; and for the costly apparel of his henxmen, and gallant trappers of their horses; besides 400 tall men well horsed, and apparel'd in his col∣lars: he was esteemed both of the Scots and Englishmen, more like a prince than a subject.</Q> He had also with him his officer of arms, named Northumberland, arrayed in a livery of velvet, bearing his armorial ensignia.</P>
<P>On the accession of Henry VIII. he was continued in the office of Warden of the Marches, which he had filled in the preceding reign. He served in the French campaign, and was present at the battle of <HI>Spurs.</HI> In the 14th of King Henry VIII. he was made Warden of the whole Marches, which office he executed for a very short time; at his own instance giving place to the Earl of Surry. He died in the 18th of King Henry VIII. and was buried at <HI>Beverley.</HI> He married <HI>Catharine</HI> daughter and coheiress of Sir Robert Spencer, by Eleanor daughter and at length heiress of Edmund Beaufort, Duke of Somerset, by Eleanor his wife daughter and heir of Richard Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick, who was great grandson of John of Gaunt, Duke of Lan∣caster.

<P>The sixth Earl <HI>Henry</HI> was deeply in love with the fair <HI>Anne Bullen,</HI> but by the art of Cardinal Woolsey, and even the royal interposition, was withdrawn from an attachment, which it is said gave great anxiety to the Sovereign. Notwithstanding the Earl's early affection for the Cardinal, in 1530, he was one of the King's Commissioners to arrest him for high treason. He was Warden of the East and Middle Marches, and one of the Knights of the Garter. He married <HI>Mary</HI> daughter of George Earl of Shrewsbury, and died without issue.</P>
<P>As his brother <HI>Thomas</HI> had been attainted, the earldom of Northum∣berland for some time remained dormant: Queen Mary restored <HI>Thomas</HI> the nephew to the honours and estates of his ancestors, the patent set∣ting forth that the same was done <Q>in consideration of his noble descent, con∣stancy of virtues, valour in deeds of arms, and other shining qualifications.</Q> The ceremony of his creation at Whitehall was attended with great pomp: <HI>the procession was preceded by</HI> 8 <HI>heralds and</HI> 12 <HI>trumpeters: he was accompanied by the Earls of Pembroke, Arundel, and Rutland, and the Lord Montague, walking in the middle, dressed in robes of crimson velvet, a hat of crimson velvet, and a coronet of gold.</HI> He was joined with Lord Wharton as Wardens General of the Marches, with very extensive powers, A. D. 1557. He commanded against the Scots who made an incursion the same year, and giving them battle near <HI>Cheviot,</HI> obtained a compleat victory: Sir John Forster was shot through the mouth, and had his horse killed under him. Sir Andrew Kerr, the Scotch leader, was taken prisoner. He with his brother <HI>Henry</HI> having entered Scotland in the following year, obtained a victory over the Scotch near <HI>Swinton;</HI> and the same year engaged the French auxiliaries with equal success, near <HI>Grindon.</HI> In jealousy of Lord Cecil's power with Queen Elizabeth, he entered into the northern conspiracy, and at length appeared in open rebellion. It would be inconsistent with my plan, in this place to speak upon that matter; it will suffice to add, that the Earl having fled into Scotland, was betrayed and delivered up, and in the 13th year of Queen Elizabeth, he and his Countess were convicted of high treason and out∣lawed;
<PB N="239" REF="245"/>
and on the 22d of August, 1572, he was beheaded at <HI>York,</HI> avowing with his last breath the Pope's supremacy, affirming the realm to be in a schism, and the subjects who were obedient to the Queen, no better than heretics.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hollingshead, Speed, and Stowe.</NOTE> He married <HI>Ann</HI> daughter of Henry Somerset, Earl of Worcester, by whom he had one son and five daughters: the son died without issue.</P>
<P>The patent of restoration made by Queen Mary having limited the titles and estates to the late Earl's heirs male, and in default of such issue, to <HI>Henry Percy,</HI> the Earl's brother, in the 18th of Queen Eliza∣beth, he was summoned to parliament by the distinction of <HI>Earl of Nor∣thumberland and Baron Percy.</HI></P>
<P>On his brother's defection, he stood loyal to the Queen, and with Sir John Forster, commanded the troops which on the 9th of Decem∣ber, in the 12th of Queen Elizabeth, routed the Earl of Westmoreland's forces in <HI>the bishopric of Durham.</HI> In the 27th year of Queen Elizabeth, being suspected of plotting to set at liberty the Queen of Scots, he was committed prisoner to the Tower; and on the 21st of June, was found dead in his bed, having three shots from a pistol lodged under his left pap, his chamber door being fastened on the inside. He married <HI>Ca∣tharine</HI> eldest daughter and coheiress of John Nevill, Lord Latimer, by whom he had issue eight sons and three daughters. <HI>Henry</HI> his eldest son succeeded him, <HI>the ninth Earl of Northumberland.</HI></P>
<P>He was one of those volunteer Lords who hired vessels to accompany Charles Lord Howard, Lord High Admiral, against <HI>the Spanish Armada.</HI> Being suspected as an accomplice in the Gunpowder Plot, he suffered a long and grievous confinement in the Tower;<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P>Wood in his Athenae Oxoniensis says, <Q>That the Rev. Mr Nathaniel Torporley, a noted Mathematician, being made known to the great Earl of Northumberland, Henry Percy, the generous favourer of all good learning, was received into his patronage, and had a pen∣sion paid yearly unto him, several years from his purse. Thomas Hariot went in 1584, with Sir Walter Raleigh to Virginia, where he was employed in the discovery and surveying thereof. After his return into England, Sir Walter got him into the acquaintance of that noble and generous Earl, who finding him a gentleman of an affable and peaceable nature, and well read in the obscure parts of learning, he did allow him a yearly pension of 120l. About the same time Robert Hues and Walter Warner, two other Mathematicians, who were known also to the said Earl, did receive of him yearly pensions also, but of less value; as did Torperley. So that when the said Earl was committed prisoner to the tower, in 1606, Hariot, Hues, and Warner, were his constant companions, and were usually called the Earl of Northumberland's 3 <HI>Magi.</HI> They had a table at the Earl's charge, and the Earl did constantly converse with them and with Sir Walter Raleigh then in the tower.</Q></P>

<P>In the 4th year of King Charles I. he obtained a confirmation to him and the heirs male of his body, of the title and dignity of <HI>Baron Percy,</HI> in as ample a manner as his ancestors had enjoyed the same. He died at his seat at <HI>Petworth,</HI> on the 5th of November, 1632. He married <HI>Dorothy</HI> daughter of Walter Devereux, Earl of Essex, by whom he had issue four sons and two daughters.

He was betrayed after a solemn oath taken by Colonel Goring, after∣wards a General of horse under the Earl of Newcastle. With some difficulty and peril he escaped their vengeance. History has drawn his character in most amiable colours. His countenance was awful and commanding respect. His mind liberal and stored with know∣ledge civil and military. This made him as able a General in the field as he was a prudent and wise Counsellor in the cabinet. In the former he awed the parliament by his manage∣ment and address; and in the latter embarrassed their measures; in both firm and intrepid; more formidable by his wisdom than his power, tho' that was great; which he employed with the ardour and zeal of a patriot, in the service of a <HI>good Master,</HI> who, to reward him, created him a Peer, by the stile and title of Baron Percy of Alnwick, 28th June, 1643. He also made him Lord Chamberlain, and give him in charge a treasure he loved well, the conduct of his Queen to Oxford.

In 1639, his Lordship was at the head of state affairs. In a letter to the Earl of Leicester, he thus expressed his sentiments of public matters: <Q>It grieves my soul to be involved in these councils; and the sense I have of the miseries that are like to ensue, is held by some a disaffection in me; but I regard little what those persons say.</Q> In 1643, he with the Earls of Pembroke and Salisbury, with several Members of the House of Commons, were indicted of high treason at <HI>Salisbury,</HI> before Judges Heath, Forster, and Glanvill, for assisting the parliament; but they could not induce the jury to find the bill.

<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Gentlemen,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>Notwithstanding your worthy Chairman has so fully expatiated. on the cause of this chearful and respectable meeting, I feel myself animated, not less from inclination than duty, to offer a few words with your permission, on the present occasion.</P>
<P><Q>Public virtues and singular acts of greatness, have ever kindled in the mind of man, an ardent desire of beholding the persons, or repre∣sentations of those in whom they shone: hence examples of great and generous actions, have been continually handed down to posterity for their imitation, and incitement to glory:—hence Caesar—hence Cato live; and their virtues remain unsullied by the grave, amidst the rust of time.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Rome had its heroes—Britain boasts of hers; and when Percy is no more, that picture shall record his deeds.</Q></P>
<P><Q>At a time when the supreme legislative authority of parliament over the whole British empire was called in question; at a time when
<PB N="243" REF="249"/>
discord, disobedience, nay rebellion itself prevailed in America;—at a time when dissipation and every species of luxury pervaded this great nation, and its direful influence was visibly increasing;—Earl Percy, disdaining every consideration that was unconnected with the com∣mon weal, boldly stood forth a champion for his country, a friend to his King, and enemy to those who had fallen from their duty.</Q></P>
<P><Q>It was not wealth, gentlemen, that could urge him to so dangerous an undertaking—Fortune had placed him above the pursuit of it:— it could not be ambition, for rank and titles were already his own; —but it was public spirit that called him forth;—for he had <HI>all to lose,</HI> but <HI>nothing to gain;</HI>—nothing but the true interest of his country to acquire. He gave up his own safety, he made a sacrifice of every thing;—pleasures, profit, and interest—all were subservient to the common good.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Without flattery, gentlemen, I may assert Rome would have gloried in such a real Patriot; Rome would have rejoiced to have seen one of their Nobility so strenuous in their country's cause.</Q></P>
<P><Q>But this was not all; and what I have said would bear but little resemblance to that great man, were I not to take notice of his un∣bounded humanity as well as public spirit.</Q></P>
<P><Q>His tenderness in a time of the greatest calamity; his readiness in sharing whatever his ample fortune afforded him with the common soldier, the widow, and the orphan, has raised his name almost above the reach of praise.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Great as his own distress was, he overlooked it, in commiserating and relieving that of others: indeed every humane and generous fea∣ture of the noble Duke his father, are clearly seen in the actions of the son.</Q></P>
<P><Q>But it is not to be wondered at, gentlemen, that humanity, genero∣sity, and magnificence, should shine forth with so much lustre in the noble Earl, when they are the acknowledged characteristics of <HI>the House of Northumberland.</HI></Q></P>

<P>I had lately an account from Alnwick, of some brass weapons found there by a mason as he was clearing the earth from a rock about a mile N. W. from that place, within the old park,
<FIGURE>

to get up some stone. After having dug about half a yard deep in the ground, he came to 20 sword blades, and 16 spear heads lying close to the top of the rock, without any case or cover than the soil. The swords were exactly of the same shape as those in the 51st plate of Mr Gordon's book. N<SUP>o</SUP> 2, 3, and 17 or 18 inches long. Some of the spears resembled 4 and 5 in the same, but others were broader and cut thro' as in the margin. Dig∣ging about a foot lower on the hill side, he found 42 brass wedges or chiz∣zels, with a ring near their thicker end, of which I doubt not, but you have seen many, and so need not give you any description of them, but that they are not unlike N<SUP>o</SUP> 4 in Mr Gordon's 50th plate. How and for what they were used, I will not take upon me to determine absolutely, but by their edges which are much broken and battered, they seem to have been employed as chizzels for cutting stone. I believe they put a wooden shaft in the hollow end of them, and so drove them with a mallet.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sir Laurence's System of Agriculture and Gardening, where he mentions some of these found in the small joints and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>vices of the stone in a quatry near Bishop Weremouth, which is no weak confirmation of my conjecture.</NOTE> If the soft∣ness of the metal and consequently its unfitness for such work is objected, I answer, that when they had not a harder, necessity would compel them to use such as they had; besides most sorts of stone are so soft when they lie bedded in, and at their first coming out of the quarry, that they might make a very good shift to cut it and cleave it with their tools, while it was under those easy circumstances; to which I may add, that these brass chiz∣zels are of a much harder temper than we know how to give that metal, as are also their swords which are made of it, and other weapons.</P>
<P>The shaft when not employed might be drawn out of the chizzel, and by running a string thro' the ring on their sides, several of them might be tied together, and conveniently carried by the workman at his girdle, or otherwise, and one shaft serve them all. About eight years ago near a bushel of them were found at Cave, upon the banks of the Humber in Yorkshire, under a little Tumulus by the highway side; and what is very remarkable, every one of them was enclosed in a matrix of the same metal, or case, fitting it so exactly, that it seemed to be cast in it, and so fresh and whole were the edges of them, all as if they had never been used.</P>
<P>A little above the place where the swords and spears were buried at Alnwick, was deeply and rudely cut in the rock 1115, but I cannot think these figures had any relation to what was sound below. I have had the good fortune to get a sword and spear, and 3 chizzels,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The Sword, Spear Hea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d, and 2 of the Chissels I presented to my Lord H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rtford.</NOTE> for a crown piece, the rest were seized by the Duke of Somerset's Steward, upon pretence of securing them for his Grace, but were never sent to him. So many of these brass chizzels have been found in this island, and so few any where else, and those only in France, that they seem almost to have been the peculiar tools of the Britons; their near alliance and intercourse with the Gauls easily accounting why they have been sometimes discovered in the antient seat of the latter. The swords and spear heads afore-mentioned being found so near these chizzels, and of the very same metal, is an argument that they belonged to the same people, which I can∣not think to have been Romans, who, as I formerly ventured to give you my opinion, seem to have left off the use of brass in their weapons, before their arrival in this island. The word Ferrum much earlier than that time, denoted in their authors all manner of military weapons, and was a general name for them, which I think is some additional strength to my former argu∣ments on that subject.</P>

<HEAD>Sir <HI>John Clerk</HI>'s Answer. 29th Aug. 1727.</HEAD>
<P>I return you thanks for the account you sent me of the Antiquities found at Alnwick, their number surprised me much. Some of the same kind have been found here in Cairns, nothing in Antiquity is more mysterious than the use of these Instruments of brass, which resemble small hatchets or chissels. I incline to think them warlike instruments, as we generally take the stone hatchets to be: I have 3 or 4 of both kinds. When they came first into my hands, I set about reading such accounts as had been given of them, and found that one Mr Hearne had taken a good deal of pains to prove they were Roman. His dissertation is printed in Mott's Collection of the Transactions of the Royal Society, v. 2. part 4. p. 70. But I cannot be of that gentleman's opinion. The Romans understood better the expeditious ways of doing things, than to make use of such slight and brittle tools: We must then ascribe them to the ancient Bri∣tons who used instruments of brass before iron came to take place: What makes me judge they were not chissels, is, that the Britons made very little use of hewn <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Stones at Stonehenge are hewen.</NOTE> stone, and for that reason little or nothing of their stone monuments does remain. It is indeed probable they made use of them for repairing their highways, for all such instruments found here were in Cairns<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P>Cairus are burying places, and therefore usually situated near Highways, so that the finding these Tools near Highways, is merely accidental.</P>

<P>The attention there is given by the Duke's servants, resident at the castle, to satisfy the inquiries and curiosity of travellers, afforded us an easy access to the pleasure grounds which lead to <HI>Huln Abbey.</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><P>John Vesey returning from the Holy War, is said to have first brought Carmelites into England, and to have built a Convent for them here at Holme, a solitary place, and not un∣like Mount Carmel in Syria. But in truth there never was any Convent or Monastery founded at Alnwick, or near it, by John Vesey: there was indeed a Monastery of the Order of the Prae∣monstratenses founded by Eustatius Fitz John, father of William de Vesey, who had the sir∣name from his mother, an heiress. But this was done in the year 1147, long before the Car∣melites were heard of in England. John Bale who was sometime a Carmelite himself, tells us that the first convent of that order was founded at Holme (Hull they now call it) near Alnwick, by Ra. Fresborn, a gentleman of Northumberland, who died A. D. 1274, and was buried in the Convent. Eustatius's Abbey is still to be seen, at half a mile distance from the Convent of Hull, down the river.</P>

<PB N="248" REF="254"/>
curious is not excluded from those beautiful scenes. The way to <HI>Huln</HI> forms one of the sweetest and most romantic rides in the county; where nature has left the lands open, art has happily disposed her works with the justest taste, to supply the vacancy. The entrance is by a steep de∣scent to the vale, through which the river winds its course. The road by traversing the hills obliquely, renders the way easy to the passenger: it is cloathed on each hand with plantations of various kinds of forest trees, mingled with great judgment, and so disposed, that the pines and evergreens give an agreeable variegation of colour in the foliage, without deadening the scene. Nothing can be more gloomy than long-extended lines of dusky firs, which, as the Poet <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mason.</NOTE> justly observes, <Q>blot the horizon.</Q> These plantations are bordered on each side of the road with a variety of flowering shrubs and tufts of flowers. After passing this agreeable grove by irregular windings, we descended into a plain washed by the solemn stream of sleepy <HI>Aln,</HI> which scarce appears to flow, so dull it seems, in this romantic valley, shut in on every hand by lofty eminences, covered with wood, forming a spacious theatre near two miles in circuit. On the right hand the river forms a semi∣circle, the opposite shore composed of shaken and perpendicular rocks, over whose brink impends a forest of oaks, rising shade above shade up to the crown of the mountains. As the <HI>Aln</HI> passes away from this sweet vale, and glides from under the feet of those romantic rocks, she doth not even yield a murmur or a sigh; except where constrained by some artificial wears, she turns over with indolence, and falls again to sleep on the succeeding lake.</P>
<P>After passing this plain, the vale grows narrow, the hills and woods are loftier, and the river here and there frets over a few pebbles which im∣pede her passage. Here is every sylvan beauty; here we tasted enjoy∣ment of all the pleasures of a woody scene—the richness of the forest hues, the deep shadow, and the refreshing breeze perfumed by wood∣bine—together with that solemnity and stillness which sooth the con∣templative mind.</P>
<P>As we winded thro' this deep valley, the prospect at length opened upon the scite of <HI>Huln Abbey:</HI> on the left hand the landskip was ab∣ruptly closed with rugged mountains of naked white rocks; opposed to
<PB N="249" REF="255"/>
which, on the right, on a grassy eminence, stand the remains of the monastery, humbly mourning in the lowly garb of solitude, and bending down in ruins: over which a tower of the Percys bears the melancholy air of unavailing defence, and overlooks the mouldering walls with an aspect of despondency, in its inability to shield off the strokes of time and devastation. We ascended to the summit of the hill, and being possessed of the keys, by which alone we could have had access to these retreats, we flattered ourselves no obstacle could arise that might deprive us of the sight of the ruins of this religious house, and every thing curious there; but the whole is enclosed with a lofty wall, the interior ground being disposed in gardening: we found the keeper of this place a little man, of a mean and insolent aspect; he heard our request with the door in his hand, after which, with a contemptuous silence, he walked in and turned the key against us, as if he was afraid we should discover some theft he was committing against his Lord. Thus excluded and looking ridiculous enough, we could do nothing more than ride round the walls, by which we ob∣served that the ruins chiefly consisted of a small chapel, wanting little besides a roof: the tower a square building, with exploratory turrets at each corner, is in good repair, fitted up as a pleasure room, command∣ing a beautiful prospect, as we could sufficiently judge from our lower situation.</P>
<P>The view from this eminence into the vale which we had passed, was singularly beautiful: the ragged, rocky, and barren mountain, which now lay on our right, afforded a bold contrast to the hanging forests and the planted eminences which intersected the winding val∣ley: the Aln was seen in meanders down the nearer and narrow dell, and in the extended distant plain the waters formed a fine lucid cres∣cent, the canal being then happily touched by the sun's beams; the heights cloathed with oaks, the lower hills girt with plantations of various hues, the bold rocks pushing forth their fronts from out the wood, all mingled with that irregularity and wildness nature alone can display in these hilly countries, formed this beautiful landskip.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Here was one of the first houses of the Carmelites, or White Friars, in England, who were brought over by John Lord Vesci about A.

<P><PB N="250" REF="256"/>I will pursue the account given by Mr Grose of this <HI>Abbey,</HI> as the most perfect one extant. <Q><HI>Hulne</HI> was the first monastery of Carmelite Friars in this kingdom. The account of its foundation is thus given by ancient writers: Among the British Barons who went to the Holy Wars in the reign of King Henry III. were William de Vesey Lord of Alnwick, and Richard Gray, two eminent chieftains in the christian army: led by curiosity or devotion, they went to visit the Monks of Mount Carmel, and there unexpectedly found a country∣man of their own, one Ralph Fresborn, a Northumberland-man, who had distinguished himself in a former crusade; and in conse∣quence of a vow had afterwards taken upon him the monastic pro∣fession in that solitude. When Vesey and Gray returned to England, they strongly importuned the superior of the Carmelites to let their countryman accompany them home; which was at length granted, upon condition that they would found a monastery for Carmelites in their own country. Soon after their return, Fresborn, mindful of their engagement, began to look out for a place for their Convent. After examining all the circumjacent solitudes, he at length fixed upon the present spot, induced, it is said, by the great resemblance which the adjoining hill bore to Mount Carmel: and indeed whoever looks into Maundril's travels, will find that the draught of that mountain, given in his book, bears a strong likeness to this be∣fore us.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The above William de Vesey gave a grant of the ground, con∣sisting of twelve or thirteen acres, in his park of Holne; but Fres∣born is said to have erected the building himself. The foundation was laid about A. D. 1240, and Fresborn gathering a proper number of Monks, became the first Abbot of the Order; and having pre∣sided here with great reputation of sanctity, at length died, and was buried in the monastery about the year 1274.</Q></P>
<P>The original grant of William de Vesey, was confirmed by his successors Veseys; and by the Percies, after their becoming proprietors of Alnwick: many additional privileges and immunities were added by the succeeding grants, particularised in Mr Grose's work, but too
<PB N="251" REF="257"/>
tedious to take place, except only such as are singularly curious fol∣lowing.</P>
<P><Q>Also all wild bees, with their fruits of honey and wax, found in Walse and in Holne, as well in the park as in the forest, for the per∣petual support of the light in their church; with a provision against the said Friars being defrauded of the said bees, wax, and honey, by the foresters and shepherds there. They shall also have yearly, out of the Lord's coney warren of Houghton, one truss of conies at Easter, and another at the assumption of the blessed Mary. And certain quantities of rushes, and twelve loads of broom, to cover their houses.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Henry Percy, 4th Earl of Northumberland, built in this abbey, a fine tower, as a place of refuge for the Monks to retire to in times of danger. Near it is this curious inscription, in ancient English.</Q></P>

<P>The charter of foundation, included in a confirmatory charter of Henry Percy, Earl of Northumberland, is addressed to <HI>William de Sta Barbara,</HI> Bishop of Durham.

From Dugdale's authority, it is said that the first of that order came to settle at Alnwick in the year 1147; but Stephens, from the authority of Raynerus, says the order first came over in 1146, and settled at Newhouse, in Lincolnshire, in their monastery built by Peter de Saulia, dedicated to St. Martialis.</P>
<P><PB N="253" REF="259"/>In the chronicle of this house, preserved in the library of King's Col∣lege, Cambridge, there is an account of <HI>a Banquet</HI> given by <HI>Walter de Hepescotes,</HI> the Abbot, A.

<P>It appears from the same authority, that divers of the Percys were in∣terred here; particularly <HI>Henry the second Lord of Alnwick,</HI> who died in 1351: <HI>Henry the third Lord,</HI> who bestowed on the Monks 100l. at his death, A.

<FIGDESC>depiction of Alnwick Abbey gateway</FIGDESC>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>There are no remains of the <HI>Abbey,</HI> but a <HI>Gateway and Tower,</HI> which by the architecture and arms sculptured upon the building, shew it is of much more modern date than the foundation of the house. This tower is not square, but oblong, having an exploratory turret on each corner. The north side is ornamented with a nich, canopy'd, capable of receiving a statue five feet high: most probable it contained the effi∣gies of the dedicatory Virgin. Beneath is a figure of an angel in relief, with expanded wings. Over this entrance are shields of arms, a cross, supposed to be the arms of the Veseys, and a cross molin. On the south side, in a nich, is the figure of one of the Religious, of the order of White Friars of Premonstratenses, in his proper habilament, in pretty good preservation. This front is ornamented with shields of arms, the arms of Brabant adopted by the Percys, with the arms of Lucys quar∣terly, the principal; and also the arms of Vesey.</P>
<P><PB N="256" REF="262"/>A gate opens to the east, on each side of which are the figures of cherubs supporting armorial shields: on this front is also a canopy and nich for a statue. Here are the arms of Brabant and the arms of Lucys on separate shields. At this entrance, as also on the north side, were machicolations; and in the center of the arching of the gateway is a square aperture, from whence the possessors could annoy assailants. The masonry of this tower is excellent; the gates of lattice braced with iron still remain.</P>
<P>Above the gate going into the court of the house, is an escutcheon of white marble, much injured by the weather, but retaining some marks of the Sculptor, to distinguish that it once contained the crest of the Doubledays, an arm in armour suspending a mullet. The antiquity of this piece has been much doubted, but the materials determine that point clearly.</P>
<P>This seat of <HI>the Doubleday family</HI> has nothing very singular to mark it, but the beauty of the retirement, under the hanging woods of the river Aln. The ground plot of the religious house is now included in the orchard; the ruins of which probably afforded materials for the pre∣sent mansion; but there are not the least remains to denote the exact scite of the monastic buildings, or the place of interment of the illustri∣ous personages before mentioned.</P>
<P>Solemn situations like this, and the ruins of religious houses, always affect my mind with a degree of languishment. Such a seclusion, such a retirement, would have filled my wish. The life of the Ecclesiastic is most desirable, and seems calculated to be the happiest. No natural tendency to indolence and ease prompts this determination; but the se∣renity of a Churchman's life, under the entire preclusion of all worldly concerns, affords that tranquillity of mind, so necessary to contemplation and study, to philosophic researches, and divine meditation—without the poison of ambition, some minds can enjoy a mediocrity with con∣tent—without an impertinent wish to intermeddle with public affairs, some men can sit within the little mansion, busied only in pious duties and contemplations; and amidst domestic peace, living each day, in gratitude for the enjoyment of the rural beauties of some sylvan scene, the plain, the mead, the grotto, and the stream—call it luxury: but the busy world incessantly rolls the heavy wheels of care too near my threshold—I am frequently induced to adopt Horace's description:

<P>This was a dependent manor of the barony of Alnwick. The town is small, but carries on a considerable trade in the export of corn and other produce of the country. The imports are chiefly timber, and some merchandize from Holland. Near the sea, on an eminence, are the remains of a church in the form of a cross. When this edifice was de∣stroyed, or by whom, is not known. The church-yard is still used for sepulture.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the banks, as washed away by the violence of the sea, have frequently been discovered, Bones of an enormous size. Ignorant spectators have retained the circumstance, without dis∣tinguishing of what animals these were the remains: and being found near a place of human interment, they are at once conceived to have belonged to men of gigantick stature. The con∣stant warfare that distressed these shores for ages, might occasion the slaughter of vast numbers of horses and other beasts, which after a day of havock may have been thrown into one com∣mon pit. The remains of elephants have been discovered in several parts of England, and have given the like apprehension to the vulgar, that giants once distressed this island.</NOTE> We approached the town of Warkworth by a fine stone bridge of three arches over the river <HI>Coquet,</HI> anciently defended by a tower with an iron gate and portcullis.</P>

<HEAD>THE CASTLE OF WARKWORTH</HEAD>
<P>stands on a lofty eminence, the town of <HI>Warkworth</HI> lying on the nor∣thern inclination of the hill, and forming a pleasing, though steep ap∣proach to the, castle: the street is wide, and contains some modern buildings. This access gives the fortress an august appearance.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P>Werkworthe Castell stondythe on the southe syde of Coquet watar. It is well maynteyned and is large. It longed to the Erle of Northomberland. It stondithe on a highe hille, the which for the more parte is includyd with the ryver, and is about a mile from these. Ther is a prety towne, and at the towne ende is a stone bridge with a towne on it. Beyond the bridge is Banborowshire.</P>

<P><PB N="258" REF="265"/>An account of this place, published in the Newcastle Courant in the year 1772, contains the following particulars: <Q>It is about three quar∣ters of a mile from the sea. The principal street stands upon a rising ground, at the higher end of which, upon an eminence, are the re∣mains of an ancient castle. The market place is in the middle of the town, where is a fine stone cross on a spacious area at the meeting of two streets, the one leading to the church, which is an elegant struc∣ture, whose spire is upwards 100 feet high; the other to the bridge, where is an ancient tower. Contiguous to the bridge is a large free∣stone quarry, the stones of which are so much esteemed, that great quantities thereof are shipped for London. The salmon fishery here is carried to a very great extent, so that at the mouth of the Coquet, in the summer season, as well as in the river itself, are some thousands caught, which gives employment to a number of hands. The river, which almost surrounds the town, directs its course in a straight line for about half a mile, then leaving the fine and pleasant villas of Glosterhill and Amble on its southern banks, while it loses itself in the ocean. In the year 1764, it left its old course, and forced its way between two sandy hills overgrown with bent, that had ob∣structed its passage for ages, and is now settled in a very deep channel, with a fine clay bottom, which makes it navigable for small craft. It is said there is upwards of 14 feet of water upon the bar at full sea, and continues that depth very near the town; so that with a little assistance of art, it might be made to admit ships of a consi∣derable burthen; and as Coquet Island is situated a little to the south∣ward, forms a fine bay at the very mouth of the river. The grounds adjoining thereto abound with a fine seam of coal; and so plentiful is corn, that few counties can equal its fertility. From these consi∣derations, what pity it is that Warkworth was not made a sea-port, since nature has almost half finished the design.</Q></P>
<P><Q>This little borough is governed by a Mayor, who is chosen annually at a Court Leet, and enjoys great privileges by an extensive common, the property of the village, and some little indulgencies from his Grace the Duke of Northumberland; and as the town consists all of free burgesses, is capable of great improvements.</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>John Fitz Robert, in 7 King Henry III. obtained licence that the market which had been usually kept upon the <HI>Sunday</HI> at his manor of Werkworth, should be held upon the Wednesday every week.</P>
<BIBL>Dugd. Baron. v. 1. p. 107.</BIBL></NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="259" REF="266"/>The castle stands on the crown of a rock, of an oblong figure; the great tower to the north, placed on the brink of the cliff above the town, is of fine architecture in chisel-work, of a singular figure, being octangular, and from the center of four opposite sides, a turret projects, of a semi-hexagonal form; from the middle of the building a very lofty exploratory turret arises. This part of the castle owes its origin to the <HI>Percys,</HI> as appears by the <HI>Lion of Brabant</HI> above the gate, and the arms dispersed over the building. The western side is formed of various irregular towers and walling of different ages, extending along the brink of the cliff, whose foot is washed by the river <HI>Coquet.</HI> On the south, the ground rises gradually to the height of the rocks on which the western buildings are founded. This side of the castle fronts to a spacious plain or platform, and is defended by a high wall with an outward moat. The ancient gateway and chief entrance to the castle is on this side; the gate defended by circular towers and a draw bridge. The eastern side is placed on the brink of a steep declivity, defended by an outward moat, and a lofty wall guarded by a square bastion near the center, and an angular tower at the south point. The walls enclose a spacious area, almost square, within which the ancient parts of the fortress are very ruinous.</P>
<P>The view from hence is so extensive and various, that description can carry but a very imperfect idea of its members or its beauties: to the east and north-east, there is a sea prospect, with which you take in all the shore we had traversed, with <HI>Dunstanbrough</HI> and <HI>Bambrough Castles</HI> at the most distant point of land: the <HI>Farn Islands</HI> lie scattered like patches on the face of the waters. The port of <HI>Alemouth</HI> is a nearer object, and at a little distance the mouth of the river <HI>Coquet</HI> and <HI>Coquet Island</HI> with its ruined monastery are seen. To the north, you view a rich cultivated country to <HI>Alnwick;</HI> westward, the banks of <HI>Coquet</HI> river, graced with little woodlands, which here and there impend on its winding channel; to the south, you view an extensive plain, in∣clining towards the sea, crowded with villages, and interspersed with woods; the shore indented by many little ports and creeks; the higher grounds are scattered over with innumerable hamlets, churches, and other buildings, mingling with a variety highly pleasing; whilst on the extreme distance, the different teints of the landskip, arising from va∣rious objects, require colours to convey their picture to the mind.</P>
<P>Mr Grose, who has given two views of this castle in his excellent work, says, <Q>nothing can be more magnificent and picturesque, from
<PB N="260" REF="267"/>
what part soever it is viewed; and though when entire it was far from being destitute of strength, yet its appearance does not excite the idea of one of those rugged fortresses destined solely for war, whose gloomy towers suggest to the imagination only dungeons, chains, and executions: but rather that of such an ancient hospitable mansion as is alluded to by Milton,</Q>
<Q><L>Where throngs of Knights and Barons bold</L>
<L>In weeds of peace high triumphs hold.</L></Q></P>
<P><Q>The castle and mote, according to an ancient survey, contained 5 acres 17¾ perches of ground. Its walls on the south, east, and west sides are garnished with towers. The great gate of the castle is on the south side, between two polygonal towers, and is also defended with ma∣chicolations.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The keep or dungeon forms the north front; its figure is a square with the angles canted off. Near the middle of each face of this square there is a turret, projecting at right angles, its end terminating in a semi-hexagon: these projections are of the same height as the rest of the keep. This keep is very large and lofty, and contains a variety of magnificent apartments.</Q></P>
<P>Mr Grose gives the copy of a survey taken of this castle in 1567, of which some extracts may be pertinent here. <Q>The Buyldinge of the sayd castell on the sowth parte is thre towres, viz. the Gatehouse towre in the middle thereof, which ys the entrye at a draw bridge over drye moyte; and in the same toure ys a prison and porter lodge, and over the same a fare lodging, called the constables lodgings; and in the curtayne is a fayre and comely building, a chapel, and divers houses of office, and above the great chambre and the Lordes lodginge. On the west side, the posterne towre, and the old hall, which was very fare at the entrye into the hall, for the porche thereof is raysed a little square towre, wherein is two chambres; and on the foresyd, in stone, portrayed a lyon, verie workmanly wrought, and therefore called the lyon towre. In the easte syde of the great hall, was an ile set owt, with pyllers, which yet standeth. The doungion is in the northe parte of the scyte of the sayd Castell, set upon a little mount highyer than the rest of the cowrte; steppes of a greas before ye enter to yt: and the same ys buyld as a foure square, and owt of every square one towre; all which be so quar∣terly

squared together, that in the syght every parte appeareth five towres, very finely wrought of mason-work: and in the same con∣teyned as well a fayre hall, kytchinge, and all other houses of offices, verie fare and apteley placed, as also great chambre, chapel, and lodgings for the Lord and his trayn. The castell is envyroned on thre partes with the sayd ryver; and of the northe parte, in an an∣gle within the sayd water is situate a towne called the borough of Warkworth, and the parish church, &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Warkworth</HI> was formerly the <HI>barony</HI> of <HI>Roger Fitz Richard,</HI> who held it by the service of one Knight's fee, of the grant of King Henry II. He married <HI>Eleanor,</HI> one of the daughters and coheiresses of <HI>Henry de Essex,</HI> Baron of <HI>Raleigh and Clavering.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The name of Clavering is derived from the barony of Clavering in Essex.</P>
<P>By the testa de Nevill it appears, that Robert, the son of Roger, held of the King in capite, by the service of one Knight's fee, the barony of Warkworth, with its appurtenances. And Roger, the son of Richard, held the same barony by like service from the time of King Henry, the father of King John, who gave it to him in fee.</P>
<P>John de Clavering was summoned to parliamant as Baron Warkworth and Clavering, 25th King Edward I. 3d King Edward III. and the 6th King Edward III.</P></NOTE> It continued in this family for several successive generations. John, in obedience to King Edward I. by his command, took upon him the surname of <HI>Clavering.</HI> In consi∣deration of certain grants of lands in the southern counties, he made over to King Edward II. the reversion in fee of his <HI>barony</HI> and <HI>castle</HI> of <HI>Warkworth,</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">And also Rothbury, Corbridge, and Newburn, which by a reversionary grant to Henry Lord Percy, now are become part of the possessions of his Grace the Duke of Northumberland.</NOTE> provided he should die without issue male. This reversion King Edward III. granted to <HI>Henry Lord Percy,</HI> from whom these pos∣sessions have descended to the present <HI>Duke of Northumberland.</HI></P>
<P>The church is a handsome building, ornamented with a spire, the inside very neat. There is a monument with the recumbent effigy of a Knight Templar, with an inscription intimating that the personage there interred was <HI>Sir Hugh de Morwick,</HI> who gave the common to the town of <HI>Warkworth.</HI></P>
<P>In a window of one of the ailes, is painted the figures of <HI>St. Hilda</HI> and an attendant female.</P>
<P>Leland says, <HI>Warkworth</HI> was much resorted to by Merchants. At present there is no navigation on the Coquet, though it is said to be practicable to bring up small craft to the bridge. The town is entitled
<PB N="262" REF="269"/>

<P>The approach is kept in neat order, but still retains its original form; a narrow walk on the brink of the river, which at this place flows without any troubled current, leads to the door of the Hermitage;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Poem of the Hermit of Warkworth, to which I shall have frequent occasion to resort in the following description, opens thus:
<Q><LG>
<L>Dark was the night, and wild the storm,</L>
<L>And loud the torrents roar,</L>
<L>And loud the sea was heard to dash</L>
<L>Against the distant shore.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Musing on man's weak hapless state</L>
<L>The lonely Hermit lay;</L>
<L>When lo! he heard a female voice</L>
<L>Lament in sore dismay.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>With hospitable haste he rose,</L>
<L>And wak'd his sleeping fire.</L>
<L>And snatching up a lighted brand,</L>
<L>Forth hied the reverend fire.</L>
</LG>
<P><HI>This short extract will shew the Poet's mode of introductions he then leads on the personages to whom the Hermit relates his tale.</HI></P>
<LG>
<L>Ah, seldom had their host, I ween,</L>
<L>Beheld so sweet a pair:</L>
<L>The youth was tall, with manly bloom,</L>
<L>She slender, soft, and fair.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>* * * * * *</L>
<L>First tell me father, said the youth,</L>
<L>(Nor blame mine eager tongue)</L>
<L>What town is here? what lands are these?</L>
<L>And to what Lord belong?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Alas! my son, the Hermit said,</L>
<L>Why do I live to say,</L>
<L>The rightful Lord of these domains</L>
<L>Is banished far away.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ten winters now have shed their snows,</L>
<L>On this my lowly hall,</L>
<L>Since valiant Hotspur (so the north</L>
<L>Our youthful Lord did call)</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Against fourth Henry Bolingbrook,</L>
<L>Led up his northern powers,</L>
<L>And stoutly fighting lost his life,</L>
<L>Near proud Salopia's towers.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>One son he left, a lovely boy,</L>
<L>His country's hope and heir;</L>
<L>And oh! to save him from his foes,</L>
<L>It was his grandsire's care.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In Scotland safe he plac'd the child,</L>
<L>Beyond the reach of strife,</L>
<L>Nor long before the brave old Earl</L>
<L>At Bramham lost his life.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And now the Percy name, so long</L>
<L>Our northern pride and boast,</L>
<L>Lies hid, alas, beneath a cloud,</L>
<L>Their honours rest and lost.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>No chieftain of that noble house</L>
<L>Now leads our youth to arms;</L>
<L>The bordering Scots despoil our fields,</L>
<L>And ravage all our farms.</L>

<LG>
<L>Their halls and castles once so fair,</L>
<L>Now moulder in decay;</L>
<L>Proud strangers now usurp their lands,</L>
<L>And bear their wealth away.</L>

<LG>
<L>Not far from hence, where yon full stream</L>
<L>Runs winding down the Lea,</L>
<L>Fair Warkworth lifts her lofty towers,</L>
<L>And overlooks the sea.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The towers, alas, now stand forlorn,</L>
<L>With noisome weads oerspread,</L>
<L>Where feasted Lords, and courtly dames,</L>
<L>And where the poor were fed.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Meantime far off, mid Scottish hills,</L>
<L>The Percy lives unknown;</L>
<L>On strangers bounty he depends,</L>

<LG>
<L>And is the Percy still so lov'd</L>
<L>Of all his friends and thee;</L>
<L>Then bless me father, said the youth,</L>
<L>For I, thy guest, am he.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Silent he gaz'd, then turn'd aside</L>
<L>To wipe the tears he shed;</L>
<L>And lifting up his hands and eyes,</L>

lofty perpendicular rocks on the other hand confining the walk to about the width of four feet. From the summit of the cliffs a grove
<PB N="263" REF="270"/>
of oaks is suspended, giving a solemn shade; and at their feet issues a spring of the purest water, which formerly supplied the Recluse. The steps, vestibule, and chief apartments of the Hermitage, are hewn out of the bosom of a free-stone rock, whose outside face is about 20 feet high, embowered with stately trees, which impend from the top of the preci∣pice and fissures of the cliffs. One lower and outward apartment is of masonry. We entered into this lower apartment by a passage of three paces, the doorway marked with the remains of bolts and iron hinges: it is built up against the side of the rock, about 18 feet square, and ap∣pears to have been the kitchen or principal dwelling, having a range or fire-place six feet wide. On the south side of this apartment, opposite to our entrance, is a doorway leading to an outward seat formed in the rock, and opening upon the walk on the river's brink. On this side
<PB N="264" REF="271"/>
of the room are two windows, which bear the marks of iron-grating, and also a closet. By holes cut in the rock, it seems as if timbers had been lodged therein for the flooring of an upper chamber. This struc∣ture is built of ashler-work, and appeared to us of much more modern date than the cells formed in the rock. Passing from this outward build∣ing the way we entered, we ascended by 17 steps to a little vestibule, with a seat on each side capable of holding one person only. Above the inner doorway some letters appear, the remains of a phrase which may be thus rendered in English: <HI>"My tears have been my food day and night."</HI> From thence we entered the principal apartment or <HI>chapel,</HI> about 18 feet in length, and not more than seven feet and an half wide, and of the same height. Two pilasters of semi-hexagonal form project from the opposite walls in the center, and one from each corner, from whence spring the intersecting groins of the roof, the joinings ornamented with roses. The pilasters have plain capitals and bases, in the old Gothic stile. All the work is chiselled, and done with mechanic ex∣actness and regularity: the wall or outside rock as you enter is left so thick, as to admit the vestibule before described. At the east end is an altar, formed cross the whole apartment, ascended by two steps; the upper plane edged with a moulding. In the center of the wall behind is a nich for a crucifix or image, with the remains of a glory. On the

<PB N="265" REF="272"/>
right hand as you approach the altar, cut out of the thickness of the wall, is a nich or cavity, like those often described in the progress of this work, left in the walls of the ailes of churches; within which there is represented a table monument (no chink or cavity appearing, to give a supposition that it is hollowed to receive any human remains) with a recumbent female figure,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr Wallis's description is in the following words. <Q>In the fole of a window, at the south end of the altar, is the effigies of the blessed Virgin, sculptured in stone, recumbent; another of the child Jesus on her right hand, standing, his left rested upon her shoulder; at her feet, in a nich in the wall, is the effigies of an Hermit, in the attitude of prayer.</Q> Mr Wallis is in an error here, for the female recumbent figure, having its head towards the east, lays with the right hand to the chapel: if any figure has stood on the side of the effigies, it must have been against the pillar which divides the windows. There is an absurdity in the idea of <HI>the boy Jesus standing over the tomb of the Virgin Mary,</HI> that need not be dwelt upon.</NOTE> the hands and arms of which appear to have been elivated. Light is admitted by two small windows behind. On the pillar which divides the windows, are the remains of some sculpture, supposed by many to be that of an hovering cherub; but with the utmost attention, and a strong desire to coincide with others, I could not see any such figure, even with an eye prejudiced by such prepossessions:<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><Q><LG>

<PB N="266" REF="273"/>
for holy water, and the feet of the effigies rest against an animal (most likely a dog, as an emblem of fidelity) as is usual on monuments of the like form. I pay great deference to the opinions of other visitants, but cannot agree with the author of the poem, that this is a bull's head, or the usual place for crests: on the contrary, according to the virtues of the deceased, ancient tombs are decorated with an animal at the foot of the effigies, as a lion for fortitude, a dog for fidelity, &amp;c. and this same figure appeared to me no other than that of a crouching dog; as is to be seen on multitudes of ancient tombs. The usual place of the crest on tombs, is under the head of the effigies. The examples in the northern counties are most likely to point out to us the prevailing fashion. The bull's head is in that position on the tombs of the family of Nevils, in Brancepeth and Staindrop churches, in the county of Dur∣ham; and a dog lays at the feet. The same on the fine tomb of Ogle, in Bothal church, and also the Ram's head on the elegant tomb of Gray, at Chillingham, with many other instances in Northumberland. Under the head of the effigies no crest appears; a double cushion is the support. By length of time, and the weather beating through the windows, the figures are greatly injured. In a nich at the foot of the monument, and cut in the wall, is the figure of an Hermit on his knees, resting his head on his right hand, and his left hand placed on his bosom, as in a lamenting or pensive posture. The author of the poem has racked invention to conceive a cause for our Hermit's vow of severity and retirement.</P>

<L>Young Lord, thy grandsire had a friend,</L>
<L>In days of youthful fame;</L>
<L>Yon distant hills were his domains;</L>
<L>Sir Bertram <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>From the advertisement to the Poem.</P>
<P>About a mile from the castle, in a deep romantic valley, are the remains of a hermitage; of which the chapel is still entire. This is hollowed with great elegance, in a cliff near the river; as are also two adjoining apartments, which probably served for the sacristy and vestry, or were appropriated to some other sacred uses: for the former of these, which runs parallel with the chapel, appears to have had an alter in it, at which mass was occasionly celebrated, as well as in the chapel itself.</P>
<P>Each of these apartments is extremely small; for that which was the principal chapel does not in length exceed 18 feet, nor is more than 7½ feet in breadth and height: it is, however, very beautifully designed and executed, in the solid rock; and has all the decorations of a com∣pleat Gothic church or cathedral in miniature.</P>
<P>But what principally distinguishes the chapel, is a small tomb or monument on the south side of the altar; on the top of which lies a female figure, extended in the manner that effigies are usually exhibited praying on ancient tombs. This figure, which is very delicately designed, some have ignorantly called an image of the Virgin Mary, though it has not the least resem∣blance to the manner in which she is represented in the Romish churches; who is usually erect, as the object of adoration, and never in a prostrate or recumbent posture. Indeed the real image of the blessed Virgin probably stood in a small nich, still visible behind the altar: whereas the figure of a bull's head, which is rudely carved at this lady's feet, the usual place for the crest in old monuments, plainly proves her to have been a very different personage.</P>
<P>About the tomb are several other figures, which, as well as the principal one above men∣tioned, are cut in the natural rock, in the same manner as the little chapel itself, with all its ornaments, and the two adjoining apartments. What slight traditions are scattered through the country, concerning the origin and foundation of this hermitage, tomb, &amp;c. are delivered to the reader in the following rhimes.</P>
<P>It is universally agreed, that the founder was one of the Bertram family, which had once considerable possessions in Northumberland, and were anciently Lords of Bothal castle, situate about ten miles from Warkworth. He has been thought to be the same Bertram that endowed Brinkburn Priory, and built Brenkshaw chapel; which both stand in the same winding valley, higher up the river.</P>
<P>But Brinkburn Priory was founded in the reign of King Henry I. whereas the form of the Gothick windows in this chapel, especially of those near the altar, is found rather to resemble the stile of architecture that prevailed about the reign of King Edward III. and indeed that the sculpture in this chapel cannot be much older, appears from the crest which is placed at the lady's feet on the tomb; for Camden informs us, that armorial crests did not become here∣ditary till about the reign of King Edward II.</P></NOTE> was his name.</L>

</LG></Q>
<P>In Mr Grose's account of this Hermitage, it is alledged, that it was universally believed the first Hermit enjoined himself this life of pennance and severity, in contrition for the murder of his own brother. I must say, I was struck with an idea on my first entrance, which grew upon me whilst I remained in these sacred vaults, and drew on a train of pensive thoughts: There needed nothing barbarous, savage, or mur∣derous to induce a man to such a life—disappointed love was sufficient of itself to incite it: Conceive the personage sculptured upon the tomb or monument, to be the devoted bride or beloved wife of the Recluse, cut off in the prime of life by some common casualty, perhaps after a short life of harmony and love in the marriage state, in the instant of bringing into the world the issue of an happy intercourse, and the heir of an opulent race—this was cause sufficient. Under such circum∣stances, we should entertain more feelings for the tender sorrows and disappointed love of the Hermit, than we can experience when we see him stained with bloody crimes, arising from wrath, revenge, rashness, or indiscretion—mad with jealousy, even to such a blindness, that he could not know his own brother, though gone forth in disguise at his instance on the same errand with himself. I own my ideas furnished me with a very different picture of the Hermit's woes—I stood over the monument with an eye flooded in tears, and a mind distressed by the tenderest touches of commiseration. After musing for some time, I imagined I could hear the distressed inhabitant exclaim: <Q>In the dust rests for ever the beloved remains of the best of women—united to me by love and wedloc—the hopes of my youth, the joy of my de∣sire, and the felicity of my possession; with her I had flattered my mind, life would pass away serenely, and the evening of the human day advance in peace: but alas! when my happiness was at its height, she was snatched from me, and forlornness beset my steps.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="275" REF="282"/>But to return to my description: The west end of the chapel is lighted by a window formed of four conjoining circles: above the inner door of the vestibule is a shield, bearing the remains of some arms; by some taken to be the figure of a gauntlet; but as it is generally believed one of the Bertrams formed this hermitage, so it is probable this shield (the remains of which seem to correspond therewith) bore the Bertrams' arms, Or, an orl, azure.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Bertrams were an ancient family in this country: they held great possessions under the savour of William the Conqueror, with whom Sir Richard Bertram; a Norman Knight, came over to England. He had in marriage, as a royal ward, Sibel, the daughter and heiress of the Mitford family. Sir William his son obtained his possessions of Mitford to be created a Barony by King Henry I. He married Alice the daughter of Sir William Merley, by whom he had issue two sons. This Sir William was, or Osbertus Colutarius, under his grant, the foun∣der of Brinkburn Priony, afterwards described.</NOTE></P>
<P>On the left hand of the altar, a window is formed in the partition of the apartments, divided by two mullions, the summit of each light or division ornamented with work formed of sections of circles, like those seen in cathedrals of the tenth century. From the chapel we en∣tered an inner apartment, by a neat door-case, over which is sculptured a shield, with the crucifixion and several instruments of torture. At the east end of this inner apartment, is an altar like that in the chapel, lighted by the last-described window, and through which the person kneeling at the inner altar, could view the cenotaph in the chapel: this apartment is about five feet wide and nine paces in length: here is also a nich or bason for holy water. On the northern side of this inner chamber, a recess is cut in the rock, of size sufficient to hold the couch of a person of middling stature. I have seen several of the like form, alcoved above, and a sole about two feet above the level of the floor to hold the matrass and bedding of the Recluse. This recess is so placed, that whilst I sat therein to make my notes, by a nich cut slantwise in the partition wall which separates the two apartments, I had a view of the cenotaph and effigies thereon. The nich seemed calculated for this very purpose; being cut through the wall assant, it could not be conceived intended to convey the light. By some it has been imagined to be de∣signed for confession, but it is my sentiment that the Hermit was priest and penitent in one; and that he had devised those apertures, that the effigies should be constantly in his sight. In this inner apartment, is a small closet cut in the side wall to the north: from this interior cham∣ber is a doorway leading to an open gallery, having a prospect up the
<PB N="276" REF="283"/>
river; but by the falling of some of the rock above, this part is greatly damaged. It is said by old people, that the roof was supported by a fine pillar, and formed a small piazza cloister or open gallery—such galleries are seen in very ancient mansions, in the centre of the front: one is yet perfect in the remains of Bradley Hall, in the county of Dur∣ham, the mansion of the eldest branch of the family of Bowes, built, as it is presumed, soon after the conquest.</P>
<P>From these cells, through a neat doorway, there are winding stairs cut in the rock, leading to its summit, supposed to conduct to the Hermit's olatory or garden. A channel is ingeniously formed on the steps to carry off the water.</P>
<P>It seems evident that the original hermitage consisted of no more than the apartments hewn in the rock, the inner one being the dwelling-place, and the little cloister the summer seat, facing westward, and commanding a beautiful view up the river Coquet, which here forms a fine curve, in extent near half a mile, on this side bordered by rocks, on the other by cultivated lands, of an easy inclination; on the extremity stands a pretty farmhold, to terminate the sequestered rural prospect. The style of architecture adopted in this hermitage is of the Saxon Go∣thic, which proves its antiquity. In the postscript to the <HI>poem</HI> of the Hermit of Warkworth, the author asserts, <Q>that the memory of the first Hermit was held in such regard and veneration by the <HI>Percy</HI> fa∣mily, that they afterwards maintained a chantry priest, to reside in the hermitage and celebrate mass in the chapel; whose allowance, uncommonly liberal and munificent, was continued down to the dis∣solution of the monasteries; and then the whole salary, together with the hermitage and all its dependencies, reverted back to the family; having never been endowed in mortmain. On this account we have no record which fixes the date of the foundation, or gives any parti∣cular account of the first Hermit.</Q> The patent is extant, which was granted to the last Hermit in 1532, by the sixth Earl of Northumber∣land.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Henry Earl of Northumberland, &amp;c.

of the above patent, it will perhaps be needless to caution the reader against a mistake some have fallen into, of confounding the hermitage near Warkworth, with a chantry founded within the town itself, by Nicholas de Farnham, Bishop of Durham, in the reign of King Henry III. who appropriated the church of Branxton for the maintenance there of two Benedictine Monks from Durham. That small monastic foundation is indeed called a cell by Bishop Tanner; but he must be very ignorant, who supposes that by the word cell, is necessary to be understood a hermitage; whereas it was commonly applied to any small conventual establishment, which was dependant on another. As to the chapel belonging to this endowment of Bishop Farnham, it is mentioned as in ruins in several old surveys of Queen Elizabeth's time; and its scite not far from Warkworth church, is still remembered.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>A Cell of two Benedictine Monks from Durham, for whose maintenance here Nicholas de Farnham, Bishop of Durham, who died A.

Ther is in the parke also one howse hewyn within one cragge, which is called the harmitage chapel: in the same ther haith bene one preast keaped, which did such godlye services as that tyme was used and celebrated.

<P><PB N="278" REF="285"/>It appears to me, that the Monks who came here in an age in which the severities of a religious life were relaxing, founded the good warm kitchen of mason-work at the foot of the rock, adapted to indulgencies unknown to the original inhabitant.

<P><PB N="281" REF="288"/>The building is in the cathedral form; the body is 22 yards in length and 13 breadth, without much ornament, and composed of a durable stone. The walls are almost entire; the great tower is very perfect: there are some remains of the dormitory, now converted into a cellar. Mr Grose observes, that <Q>these ruins exhibit one among the many in∣stances wherein circular and pointed arches occur in the same build∣ing, and that in parts manifestly constructed at the same time; which shews, that about the period of its erection, there was a kind of struggle between the ancient mode or Saxon, and what is called Go∣thic architecture; in which neither style then thoroughly prevailed. The upper range of windows in this church are all circular; those immediately under them are pointed. Two doors, one on the north, the other on the south, have circular arches, (of various members, falling back, supported on pilasters) richly adorned with variety of Saxon ornaments, particularly that on the north, which has among others the heads of animals. These are generally deemed the most ancient decorations of that style. The great tower has four pointed arches, and others of the same shape are supported by massy octa∣gonal pillars in the body of the church. There have been burials here as late as the year 1745. At the east end, and in the north and south crosses, were chapels; in one of which are divers fragments of coffins and human bones. On the whole, though this building, ex∣cept about the doors, is remarkably plain, it has a sober and solemn majesty, not always found in buildings more highly decorated. Part of this, perhaps, it may owe to its romantic situation, which is the most proper in the world for retirement and meditation. Near the south∣west

<P>The Chantry founded at Morpeth, was situated on the north east of the bridge, as you enter the town, very near the side of the river Wansbeck, in a beautiful vale of wood and water, as most of the religious houses in the north are. It was partly pulled down at the dis∣solution of the Monasteries, and remained in that situation till the 6th year of King Edward VI. when a Grammar School was founded here, and endowed with the whole estates, as appears by the Grant annexed. The middle area to the west is entire, enlarging the windows, and break∣ing convenient doors, for the original entrance to the west, is built up with a window in the Belfrey. The north area is almost demolished, and many houses built out of the materials on the ground; in a yard behind these houses the ground plan may be traced with the greatest ease, which has been cruciform. A very handsome modern-built Chapel, for the use of the town, was built some years ago on the south, and the Grammar School is kept in the west part, which is entire. I am well informed that some of the estates and revenues mentioned in the Grant of King Edward VI. have been alienated from the good purposes of the founder, are fallen at last into private property, and are so held to this day.</P>

<P>Edward the VIth, by the grace of God of Great Britain, France, and Ireland King, Defen∣der of the Faith, and over the church of England and Ireland supreme head: To all to whom these our present letters shall come greeting, Know ye, that we, as well upon the humble petition of William Lord Dacre, Greystock, and Gilsland, as of the Bailiffs and Burgesses of the town of Morpeth, in our county of Northumberland, and many other of our subjects of the whole county there adjoining, for founding and erecting a Grammar School there for the instruction and education of youth, do of our special favour, &amp;c. grant and ordain, that from henceforth there shall be one Grammar School in the said town of Morpeth, which shall be called the Free Grammar School of King Edward VI. to be continued for ever. And we do by these Presents declare, that the said School shall have one Master and Assistant. Know ye, that of our special favour we have granted, of our free will and pleasure, to the Bailiffs and Bur∣gesses of the said town of Morpeth, in the county of Northumberland, all those two late Chan∣tries in Morpeth, in the said county, and all that late Chantry of St Egidius, founded in the chapel of Witton, in the parish of Hartburn, in the said county, with all their rights, &amp;c. And all and singular our messuages, lands, tenements, cottages, gardens, meadows, pastures, feedings, rents, reversions, services, and hereditaments whatsoever, situate and being in Mor∣peth and Nether Witton, and elsewhere in the said county, to the said late Chantries belong∣ing, which had been formerly granted or appointed for the support of any of the Presbyters or Ministers formerly ministering in the said late Chantries, or any of them; and also all and sin∣gular our messuages, lands, &amp;c. &amp;c. situate and being in Morpeth aforesaid, and in Ponteland, Milburne, Dorris Hall, High Callerton, Berwick Hill, Low Callerton and Dennington, or elsewhere in our said county, which have been granted for the support of any Presbyters or Ministers formerly ministering in Morpeth, for the support of the School of Morpeth, or for the support of the Presbyter or Minister in Ponteland, in the said county; and the reversions of all and singular the said premisses, in as ample manner to hold, as any of the Ministers of the late Chantries, or any Master of the School in Morpeth, or any person whatever formerly had occupied or enjoyed the same, as all and singular the said premises have or ought to have come to our hands, by reason of any act passed in our parliament, held at Westminster in the

And we also give to the said Bailiffs and Burgesses, the profits growing out of the same, from the feast of the annunciation of the blessed Virgin Mary last past, to the date hereof, without fine or gift to us or our heirs and successors for the same. And further we grant to our said Bailiffs and Burgesses, and the major part thereof, power with the then Bishop of Durham to appoint Masters when necessary, to make statutes and laws in writing for the government of the same, the salary, the direction and management of the rents, &amp;c. for the support of the said School for ever. And we further empower our Bailiffs and Burgesses to take and receive to them and their successors, or of any other person, manors, messuages, lands, tenements, rectories, tythes, and other hereditaments whatsoever within the kingdom of Great Britain, or elsewhere, within our dominions, so as they do not exceed the yearly value of 20l. as well to support the said School as for the support of the Bridge, or other necessary buildings in Morpeth, besides the said messuages, lands, &amp;c. &amp;c. to the said Bailiffs and Bur∣gesses, and their successors aforesaid granted, the statute of Mortmain concerning lands and hereditaments, or any other statute, act, or ordnance, had or provided to the contrary.

It is placed on a lofty eminence, unassisted by art; the southern side is very steep, and washed by the river Wansbeck; the northern secured by a deep valley. The tower has formerly had angular turrets at the north-east and south-east corners, with a com∣munication by an open gallery which was supported by projecting cor∣bles: there is no portcullis. In the centre of the arched roof of the gateway is a square aperture, calculated to annoy assailants who should gain the outward gate. It commands a fine prospect, overlooking the town of Morpeth, and the banks of Wansbeck, where large tracts of woodlands are beautifully disposed. Near this tower, towards the north-east, and on the other side of the deep dell or valley, before described, is a round <HI>mound of earth,</HI> on a natural mount whose height is greatly in∣creased by art. It appears to have been raised rather by assailants than as an outwork or defence to the castle; for from thence, by engines, stones and missile weapons might be thrown into the interior parts of the fortress, to annoy the garrison: and agreeable to the modes practised in early times, perhaps this was cast up for an opposing fort and <HI>mal∣voisin</HI> on some blockade. No record come to my knowledge proves who
<PB N="300" REF="307"/>
was the first founder of this castle; early in the time of the Normans, the baronial seat of the Merleys was here, and probably they had a stronghold upon the very eminence where the present remains stand— the tower was the work of William Lord Greystock, who lived in the time of King Edward III. as appears by the escheats of that reign.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Iste <HI>Willielmus</HI> victoriosus et in omnibus hostitudiis gloriosus erat valde; et cum aedificasset castellum de <HI>Graistock,</HI> et <HI>Turrem de Morpath,</HI> et multa alia dignitatis opera, obiit apud Bramps∣peth, et apud Graistock sepultus est.</P>

</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>BOTHALL,</HEAD>
<P>the <HI>baronial inheritance</HI> of the family of <HI>Ogles,</HI> distant from <HI>Morpeth</HI> about four miles. This ride is extremely beautiful, lying within a little dis∣tance of the river Wansbeck, the banks of which to the south are lofty, and cloathed with fine hanging woods, through which here and there you see a bold promontory or rocky precipice. All the environs of the river to Bothal are romantic and beautiful. The <HI>castle,</HI> though placed on a considerable eminence, yet stands in a very deep vale; hanging woods forming an amphitheatre at the distance of about half a mile. Its pre∣sent remains chiefly consist of the great gateway, flanked on the north side by two polygonal towers, 53 feet high; and on the south-west angle by a square turret, whose height measures 60 feet. From the towers of this gate the outward wall extends along the brink of the eminence, in
<PB N="306" REF="313"/>
a circular form, enclosing the area and interior buildings of the castle. This enclosure contains about half an acre, in which are some scattered fragments of the inner buildings, now affording no degree of certainty what were their original form and use. To the north-west of the gate∣way, was formerly another tower, pulled down within the memory of persons living, which bore the denomination of Ogle's Tower. The scite of this castle to the south is very lofty, on the brink of a rock, whose foot is washed by the river: the east and west sides of the emi∣nence have been defended by a moat. Mr Grose, to his second plate of this castle, which chiefly represents the gateway tower, says, <Q>the wood scene in the back ground slopes to the water's edge, here and there skirted by picturesque rocks; and in many places the trees overhang the stream, which here runs briskly, breaking against the huge stones plentifully scattered throughout its channel; at once cap∣tivating the eye, and by its gentle murmurs sweetly soothing the ear. Indeed the banks of the Wansbeck, between this place and Morpeth, afford a variety of sylvan scenes, equal in beauty to any in the king∣dom.</Q></P>
<P>I must descend to more minute descriptions of the gateway with its towers;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This gate-way is of the same model as the gate of Alnwick castle, and by its architecture and ornaments appears to be nearly of the same date.</NOTE> they bear a certain appearance of being the most modern parts of this castle; the architecture is excellent, and the edifice built of a durable stone, well drest, and in good preservation: the ascent from the town is easy and gradual. The outward gate was defended by a portcullis; in the arching of the roof of the gateway, are three square apertures, from whence the garrison could annoy the assailants, when they had gained the first gate; a door on each hand leads to the flank∣ing towers. On the right hand, is a passage and staircase in the south∣west tower; at the foot of the stairs is a door into the prison, which is not so horrible an enclosure as most of those seen in baronial castles: it is above ground, and closely arched, having narrow apertures, like loop∣holes, to admit light and air from the gateway passage. Opposite to these stairs, on the other side of the gateway, is a large hall. Passing the winding stairs, we entered the state-room, above the gateway: this apartment is lighted by four windows, none of them of any consider∣able size; the principal one is to the north, in the centre: by means of the thickness of the wall, the recess formed for the window is benched
<PB N="307" REF="314"/>
with stone at the sides, with seats for six persons at least. From this window you view the town, the church, and a narrow vale, through which the river flows. On each side of this window, is a door leading to the chambers of the flanking towers. The fire-place, of a very spa∣cious range, is to the east, on the left side of which is another window with a recess, benched like that before described. A third window like the two former, is to the right of the door as you enter, looking into the area of the castle; a large window to the west commands the wider part of the vale, and the fine hanging woods by which it is is bounded. Three large stones cover the apertures in the floor, which open upon the passage of the gateway. The upper rooms being more ruinous, are not so easy to describe, or their form capable of being as∣certained. I walked these apartments with a veneration, proceeding from the tenderest obligations; an alliance with a lineal descendant of those illustrious families, who for ages possessed this inheritance.</P>
<P><FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>In the front of the gateway, are several shields of arms arranged in the following order; which I apprehend, like those at <HI>Alnwick,</HI> perfectly point out to us the time when this part of the castle was built. In the centre, in a large shield, are the arms of <HI>England and France</HI> quarterly. It is observable that England takes the first quarter, a thing I have never observed an instance of before. On the dexter side, a shield with the arms of <HI>England, three lions passant gardant;</HI> on the sinister, a shield with the arms of the Grays, <HI>barry of six argent and azure, three torteauxes in chiefe.</HI> This denotes that the erection was made in the time of Edward IV. whose consort was a Gray, mother of Thomas Gray, who in the 15th year of that reign was created Marquis of Dorset. Beneath, in the
<PB N="308" REF="315"/>
centre, the arms of Bertram, <HI>Or, an orl, azure.</HI> On the dexter and sinister sides of this, are three shields, which denote the alliances of the Bertram family.</P>
<P>The first, on the dexter side, the arms of Percy</P>
<P>The second of Dacre</P>
<P>The third of Vesey, Or, a cross, sable.</P>
<P>The first, on the sinister side, of Darcy</P>
<P>The second of Hastings</P>
<P>The third, two lions passant gardant in a tressure; but to what fa∣mily this coat armour appertains, I cannot form any probable assertion.</P>
<P>On the tower on the right hand of the gateway, are four shields, the chief of which is of the Ogles; but as they are greatly defaced by time, and on my view did not seem to have any material relation to the date or history of this erection, I passed them without particular atten∣tion: but on considering the matter, I am induced to believe that John Ogle, the grandson of the heiress of Bertram, and who assumed the name of Bertram, erected this gateway. In the family of Ogles after∣wards mentioned, he is particularly noticed.</P>
<P>In the centre, on the battlement, is the figure of a man, in stone, in the attitude of sounding a horn; on the right hand tower is another figure, holding a ball between his hands: these figures are greatly in∣jured by the weather.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The following curious survey of this castle was published in the Antiquarian Repertory.</P>
<P>The following extract is copied from a survey called the book of Bothool Baronrye, in Nor∣thumberland, most beautifully written, and in high preservation, the property of his Grace the Duke of Portland, to whom that barony now belongs. It was taken the 20th day of June; 1576, by Cuthbert Carnable, Robert Maddison, and John Lawson, tenants to that manor, by virtue of a commission granted by Cuthbert Lord Ogle, and directed to the afore-named Cuth∣bert Carnabie, Robert Maddison, Jacob Ogle, Esqrs Anthony Ratcliff and John Lawson, Gents. the whole 5, or any 4, 3, or 2 of them. Dated at Bothole the 6th day of May in the said year.</P>

<P><PB N="309" REF="316"/>The scite of Bothal appears very like a Roman station: Camden says, that he had thought for some time, that the Roman <HI>Glanoventa</HI> stood on the banks of <HI>Wansbeck,</HI> garrisoned by the first cohort of the <HI>Morini;</HI> for it is seated in the range of the wall, where the Notitia places it: the river's name is <HI>Wants-beck,</HI> and <HI>Glanoventa,</HI> in the Bri∣tish tongue, signifieth THE SHORE OR BANKS OF VENTA. Mr Grose has the following remarks on the <HI>Bertrams,</HI> the original possessors of this <HI>castle.</HI> <Q><HI>Richard Bertram,</HI> who lived about the time of King Henry II. gave two sheaves, or two third parts of the tithes of this barony to the Monks of <HI>Tinmouth.</HI></Q> (In Bourne's History of New∣castle, it is said, <Q>being a devout man, he gave two shares, i. e. two third parts of the titles of it, to the Monks.</Q>) <Q>His son Robert obtained of King Richard I. that his manor with its dependencies should be raised to <HI>a barony;</HI> and it is mentioned as such, in that an∣cient record, remaining with the King's Remembrancer in the Ex∣chequer, called Testa de Nevil, from its being compiled by Jollan de Nevil, who was a Justice Itinerant in the 18th and 24th years of King Henry III. It contains the King's fees through the greatest part of England, with inquisitions of lands escheated and serjeantries.</Q></P>
<P><Q>This <HI>barony</HI> was held by Robert of the King in capite, by the ser∣vice of three Knights fees, as his ancestors had formerly held it; the said lands being <HI>de veteri feofmento,</HI> and paying yearly for the castle guard at <HI>Newcastle upon Tyne</HI> for <HI>cornage</HI> 5l. 15s. 4d.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Robert was succeeded by his son Roger, who procured a charter for free warren, for all his demesne lands here and at Heburn in this county. His heirs enjoyed the barony for some successions, without making any additions to its grandeur; but <HI>Robert Bertram</HI> being in the reign of King Edward III. constituted Sheriff of Northumberland and Governor of <HI>Newcastle upon Tyne,</HI> obtained a licence of that King to make a <HI>castle</HI> of his manor house at <HI>Bothal.</HI></Q></P>

I presume the personages there represented are Sir Robert Ogle and his wife, the Baroness Bertram. His effigy is cloathed in a coat of mail, the hands elevated, about his neck a chain, with a cross pendant on his bosom, his hair cut over his forehead and round by his ears, his head supported on his crest a bull's head, his feet rested against a curled water dog. Her effigy is dressed in a long robe, which conceals her feet; over her head and shoulders a mantle flowing back, her hands elevated, her head sup∣ported by a cushion tasselled at the corners, kept by two <HI>Esquires</HI> in their proper habiliments, each holding a tassel; on the lap of her robe a small Italian greyhound. A sword sheathed lies between these effigies. At the head of the tomb, in niches ornamented with tabernacle-work, are four Ecclesiastics, their crowns shaven, and with hands elevated; at a corner, an inclining shield, supported on the dexter side by a lion col∣lared and chained, and on the sinister side, by a monkey chained by the waste.

The erection is all of well-wrought free stone; its dimensions within, eight yards in length, and four in breadth; the roof, now gone to decay, was arched with stone, after a curious form, as appears by its remains.

George Hay, Earl of Kinnoul, and brother to the present, whose illustrious ancestors are recorded for their virtues and military atchievements, in the annals of their country. He was a man of deep erudition, an excellent pastor, a steady loyalist, and a statesman of unbiassed integrity. He mixed affability with dig∣nity, and at the same time he commanded reverence he was courteous. In his archiepiscopal character, he was rigid, yet easy of access; and as he was benevolent, so was he slow of condemnation. He constantly avoided the bustle of greatness, and in his country retreat, putting off the dignity of his office, he was distinguished as a generous friend, an inimitable parent, and a gracious neighbour. He was a student in Christ Church College, Oxford, and had the degree of Doctor in Divi∣nity 27th June, 1745. He took the name and arms of Drummond, as heir intail to his great grandfather, William Drummond, Viscount Strathallan. He married Henrietta daughter of Peter Auriol, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> Mer∣chant, of the city of London, by whom he had issue three sons and two daughters. He became Chaplain to King George II. in August, 1727; was installed Prebendary of Westminster 29th April, 1743; and consecrated Bishop of St. Asaph 24th April, 1748: he was afterwards translated to Sarum, and made Archbishop of York in 1761; in the same year he was made Lord High Almoner to the King, and one of his Majesty's Most Hon.

<P>The church stands on the north side of the haven, on a point of land which projects a considerable way into the sea; and it is said there are the remains of a pier there. This church was formerly a much more considerable edifice, now the middle aile and steeple with a spire only remaining: which circumstances give rise to an idea, that New∣biggin and its haven were in some former age of more considerable im∣portance. The spire is a mark to Seamen, of great use to ships coming from the North and Baltic Seas, as a direction for their southward course. The ornament of the altar seems to have been a devoted gift by some Seaman who had escaped the perils of the ocean, being the King's arms carved in wood for the stern-piece of a ship.</P>

No man is more valuable to the com∣monwealth, than he who applies his opulence in the improvements of agriculture: the produce of our lands is a staple of which we cannot be robbed by foreign enemies; a treasure which no change in the ba∣lance of Europe can waste; an intestine wealth, which will give power without the jeopardies attending common merchandize; the increase will ever find an efflux to states which cannot support their numbers by the produce of their own land, and will ever secure an influx of wealth. Our lands afford a perpetual supply of trade; the goods derived from manual occupations, are the objects of fluctuating taste; and when Birmingham and Wolverhampton shall no longer bear the laborious anvil, our wool, our corn and cattle will remain a lasting source of wealth. Manual occupations are transferrable, and in future ages may and will be moved from their present seats, and take place in other kingdoms and distant quarters of the earth; but the produce of lands, as they are local, so are they universally necessary; those of our climate in particular: others produce the luxuries we seek, but ours the neces∣saries every climate requires.

This facade is rendered extremely beautiful by the breaks and fine proportions of its parts, and by the excellent sculpture with which it is dressed; and the whole is crowned with a ballustrade and proper pedestals on which urns are placed: at each end hereof are seen the upper external parts of the grand staircases, rising nearly to the height of the apex of the central pediment, which afford a very graceful effect, being ornamented with a series of round ballusters terminated by pedestals, out of which arise, in form of urns, the tops of chimneys. The perron to the portal has two landing places, the upper of which is of the height of the basement story, constructed boldly in bossage-work, serving as a basis for the edifice, and giving an appear∣ance of great strength to it. On each side hereof a corridor unites to the house two noble wings, adorned with beautiful arcades, extending along the whole length of the fronts. These as well as the body of the house are all covered with lead; their perfect unity therewith, their

graceful projections, niches, and pediments, form a most grand and pleasing court, being terminated with two beautiful pavilions, con∣nected also by a corridor. The first room which you enter is a most stately hall, 44 feet long and 44 feet high; here all the ornaments strike by simple but grand uniformity. Numerous arches, recesses, and niches please the informed observer, more with the harmony of their proportions than with the splendour of their decorations. The floor is of a black and white marble, and the chimney-piece finely adapted to the great stile of the room; the figures which support it are exquisitely executed, as are the basso relievos, and all the decorations: opposite to the door is a grand music gallery, faced with elegant iron ballustrades upon a fine entablature, and supported by beautiful consoles: in the uppermost niches are statues as large as the life, admirably executed by the best Italian Artists, with their attitudes and symbols representing Music, Painting, Geography, Sculpture, Architecture, and Astronomy; and in the interstitial solids are the pictures at full length of Sir John and Lady Hussey Delaval, and their children. The ceiling is extremely elegant to the right and left passages, paved with marble, leading through lofty arches to handsome rooms, wainscotted with mahogany, in which are the pictures of <HI>Admiral Delaval,</HI> and others of Sir John's ancestors, by Sir Godfrey Kneller, and other good portrait painters; and also to the two grand winding geometrical stone staircases, 17 feet in diameter, reaching from the bottom to the top of the house, of a structure which has been greatly admired by all who have seen them, having iron ballusters of a very light and elegant form. The hall leads to a splendid saloon, front∣ing the pleasure grounds, 75 feet long, and from the door at which you enter it to the folding glass doors on the opposite side thereof it is 30 feet wide: these open into a most magnificent portico, of the Ionic order, tetrastite, of which the columns are three feet diameter. In this room there are eight majestic fluted Corinthian columns of the most beau∣tiful stone, and the same number of pilasters, which divide it into three spaces; the ceiling was executed by the famous Italian artist Vercelli, and is exquisitely modelled, and admirably coloured: here are several finely painted whole length pictures of this family. At the east end is a small antichamber, which leads into a spacious drawing-room, and also into a lesser drawing-room contiguous to an an elegant eating-room beautifully ornamented with festoons of fruit and flowers, formed of a most durable composition, and so admirably painted as perfectly to re∣semble nature. Collateral to these stately apartments are others for re∣tirement and waiting-rooms, connected with a stone winding staircase
<PB N="332" REF="342"/>
of fine workmanship, being ten feet three inches in diameter, and com∣municating with the great staircase at every landing-place, through either of which you may ascend to a grand gallery on the next floor, on each side whereof are several large and finely proportioned bed-chambers, and from whence you may pass into 14 new rooms lately built by Sir John, among which are several stately bed-chambers and dressing-rooms; and he has also highly ornamented the greatest part of this fine mansion with new and rich furniture. Most of the best rooms have marble chimney-pieces of admirable workmanship. All the offices in the base story, which are very numerous, are arched with hewed stone, from whence you may go on the same level to the east and west wings; in the former thereof are the noble stables, the chief of which is 62 feet long and 41 wide, and 24 feet 8 inches high, the roof being supported by three superb arches 21 feet 4 inches high: the divisions of all the stalls and the niches for the hay are of stone. In this wing there is a gallery extending the whole length of its front, and several commo∣dious rooms. The other wing contains a spacious and lofty kitchen and offices of all kinds on the ground floor; and in the second floor se∣veral good apartments, and a gallery also reaching along the whole length of it. This splendid seat stands in part of the pleasure grounds, surrounded by a ha-ha, having a wall of hewn stone nine feet high, and considerably more than a mile in circumference, which is not seen from the house. Here are several walks disposed with great taste, some of which are shaded as well by lofty old trees as plantations, through which various vistas are cut, some of them being terminated by elegant stone buildings, and others opening delightful prospects to the sea towards the east, greatly heightened by ships which are frequently sailing in sight of the windows: to the south there is a fine view over a verdant lawn to another bay of the sea, where frequently 150 sail of colliers may be seen, and enriched with the fine ruin of Tynemouth Priory, a grand obelisk, and several villages and hamlets interspersed, forming a very beautiful landskip: to the west there is an avenue of a mile and quarter long, and to the north a view of a great part of Northum∣berland, extending over a space of 60 miles, terminated by the august mountains of Cheviot. This house stands within a few yards of the place where <HI>Delaval Castle,</HI> the ancient baronial seat of the family, for∣merly stood. Near the house is <HI>the family chapel,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In this chapel are two tombs with recumbent effigies, the one a Knight in armour, who had made the crusade, the other a Lady: but there is no inscription to denote the personages they represent.</NOTE> of Saxon antiquity,

where divine service is constantly performed: not far from thence there is an elegant <HI>Mausoleum,</HI> which has lately been built by Sir John and Lady Hussey Delaval <HI>to the memory of their late son,</HI> who was the delight not only of his parents, but of all who knew him; his endowments were so pleasing, and his manners so captivating, that the most able panegyrist would want words to give an adequate idea of this <HI>most admirable young man.</HI> No expence has been spared in this pious edifice, which has been justly admired by every one who has seen it; the perron to the entrance being of the height of the zocle of the building, serves as a continual pedestal to it; the portico is of the doric order tetrastite, the columns of which are each formed of one single stone, weighing several tons, bearing a handsome pediment with a triangular tympanum: the dres∣sing of the whole is elegant and simple; a cupola covered with lead, rising majestically in the centre, produces a very solemn appearance: the inside is of the form of a chapel, having a nave in the middle, with an altar or communion table, above which a solemn dome is sup∣ported by semicircular arches, opening to an aile on each side, in which are several arches and niches for the reception of tablets, inscriptions, and monuments; underneath are catacombs strongly arched, and of most durable workmanship: they are all founded, as is the whole of this structure, upon a rock; and as all the stones of which it is com∣posed are large, and set so close together as not to admit of any wall falling, it is calculated to last as long as the work of man can do: it is enclosed by a ha-ha wall of 11 feet high and 5 feet thick, so wrought and put together as to have a rocky appearance, giving the idea of long duration; and by forming from its rudeness a strong con∣trast to the building, which is all polished as well as stone can be, pro∣duces an admirable effect.</P>
<P>A delightful shady walk, of a mile long, leads to Sir John's port of <HI>Hartley,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In a periodical publication, printed for Snagg, in Fleet-street, I find the following ac∣count: <Q><HI>Cullicoats,</HI> a place otherwise of no great distinction, but worthy remembrance in this respect, that it is a very commodious little port, of artificial construction, or as the common people stile it, an harbour made by hand. It is dry at low water and difficult at the entrance; but it serves for coals and salt belonging to the works of particular persons, at whose expence it was constructed. <HI>Seaton Sluice</HI> was originally of the same kind. Sir Ralph Delaval was continually contriving new improvements, in the exercise of which he never hesitated at expence; and amongst the rest made this port, on his own plan, and entirely at his own charge, for the benefit of his tenants and himself immediately, but with∣out excluding others who chose to use it. In the construction of this small harbour he found enough to exercise his skill and patience; the stone pier which covered it from the north east wind, being carried away by the sea more than once; and when he had overcome this diffi∣culty by using timber as well as stone, he felt a new inconvenience by his port's filling up with mud and sand, though a pretty sharp rill ran through it, which had so hollowed the rock as to produce the very bason which Sir Ralph would convert into a haven. In order to remove this mischief, he placed a new strong sluice, with flood-gates upon his brook, and these being shut by the coming in of the Tyde, the back water collected itself into a body, and forcing a passage at the ebb, carried all before it; and twice in 24 hours scoured the bed of the haven clean. King Charles II. who had a great taste for matters of this kind, made him collector and surveyor of his own port.</Q></NOTE> whence his coals, well known in London by that name, are
<PB N="334" REF="346"/>
shipped. There are also large salt works and copperas works, and like∣wise very considerable glass works, which were built by Thomas Delaval, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> and purchased of him by Sir John, who has cut through a solid and hard rock a new entrance into his harbour, which is 52 feet deep 30 feet broad, and 900 feet long: this great work he did at his own private expence, which no person has any share or concern in but him∣self: no ships come hither except for his coals, salt, glass, and copperas; the three last-mentioned works are carried on here for the sake of con∣suming the small coals of his colliery, which would without them be of no value. Before this new entrance was effected, the opportunity for exportation here was very confined, as the ships, for want of a suf∣ficient depth of water in the old entrance, were obliged to be loaded with keels, whereas they can now sail out with their full loadings. These works produce to the public <HI>a revenue of above</HI> 20,000<HI>l. a year,</HI> and afford Sir John the means of constantly supporting several hundred people who live upon his estate in honest industry, in which he and Lady Hussey Delaval take great delight.</P>
<P>Sir John has also made a little harbour of refuge in <HI>St. Mary's Island,</HI> for the safety of the Fishermen upon this coast, by which many have been saved who could not possibly, in certain winds, have reached any other harbour.</P>

<HEAD>FORD CASTLE,</HEAD>
<P>which Sir John Hussey Delaval considers as his sporting seat, imme∣diately succeeding that of the princely mansion of <HI>Seaton Delaval,</HI> I re∣served it for this place.</P>
<P><PB N="335" REF="347"/>From <HI>Yevering Bell,</HI> and the eminences beyond <HI>Wooler,</HI> it has a noble appearance, arising from a fine cultivated plain. <HI>This Castle</HI> was re-edified by Sir John, the antique stile being well preserved in the design; two towers, one on the east flank, and one on the west, being the only remains of the old castle which are retained in this edifice. The work was begun in the year 1761, and compleated in two or three years. The front is to the south, the centre of which is formed by a semi∣hexagonal projection, and its terminations are square turrets; from whence, on each hand, a regular wing is advanced. On the west side of the area in front, is an old square tower of singular form, it being composed of two turrets, one arising above another; the upper one being so much less than that which supports it, as to afford a spacious battlement. The area is enclosed by a wall embrazured and garnished with turrets, the entrance to which is by a spacious gateway: the wall is defended by corner towers.</P>
<P>This castle is seated on the east banks of the river Till: It appears by Madox's Exch. p. 647, that <HI>Sir William Heron</HI> built it in the 12th year of the reign of King Henry III. A. D. 1227, the estate having come to his family by an intermarriage with the heiress of <HI>Ford,</HI> who derived her descent from <HI>Odonel de Ford,</HI> as is mentioned in the pre∣ceding page 19, and who was seized thereof in the time of King Henry I.</P>
<P>The castle commands a fine prospect up the valley as far as Wooler bounded by lofty eminences, which rising swiftly, are broken in the most agreeable and romantic manner. To the westward, at about the distance of a mile and a half, you view <HI>Flodden Hill,</HI> marked to the eye by a rising plantation of firs,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Made by Sir John Hussey Delaval.</NOTE> which crowns the eminence, and gives a beautiful object upon the landskip. In great floods the Till over∣flows several hundreds of acres of flat ground; the extensive sheet of water makes a grand appearance from the castle: when it subsides, the plain is left covered with a most fertilizing mud, by which the soil is greatly enriched.</P>
<P>From the happy taste her Ladyship possesses for a rural life, Sir John has advanced the more rapidly in those works of improvement which
<PB N="336" REF="348"/>
mark the adjacent country. The fair example becomes illustrious, by the contrast which is seen in the lives of persons of equal rank and opulence. The works which are spread around <HI>Ford</HI> and <HI>Seaton Delaval,</HI> whilst they dispense felicity to innumerable laborious families, contri∣bute greatly to the general opulence of the state. No panegyric can pay due praise to those who thus employ their abundant wealth: the effect is not contracted within the circle of Sir John's possessions, the example influences as it carries with it conviction, and many are thereby induced to cultivate and improve the adjacent estates, recovering from a prepossession of ages of ignorance, that the nature of the soil and cli∣mate would frustrate their attempts. A vast tract of land, on which you look from <HI>Ford,</HI> was within 20 years last past, one continued sheep-walk; now intersected and enclosed with excellent quick-wood fences; the eminences adorned with fine plantations; the large and open farms which heretofore gave the country the aspect of poverty and desolation, are now subdivided, and let out into smaller allotments from 60l. to 200l. a year each, by which the country has become well peopled, and the lands, which for pasturage did not yield above one shilling per acre, now let for twenty-five shillings. The vice of enlarg∣ing farms, destroying villages, and thereby depopulating a country, was advanced to such enormity in the reigns of King Henry VII. and King Henry VIII. that it called for a parliamentary inquiry and restric∣tion. No language can more strongly express the error, than the pre∣amble of the statute of the 25th of King Henry VIII. cha. 14. <Q>For as much as divers and sundry persons of the King's subjects of this realm, to whom God of his goodness hath disposed great plenty and abundance of moveable substance, now of late within few years have daily studied, practised, and invented ways and means how they might accumulate and gather together into few hands as well great multitude of farms as great plenty of cattle, and in especial sheep, putting such lands as they can get to pasture, and not to tillage, whereby they have not only pulled down churches and towns, and enhanced the old rates of the rents of the possessions of this realm, or else brought it to such excessive fines, that no poor man is able to meddle with it, but also have raised and enhanced the prices of corn, cattle, wool, pigs, geese, hens, chickens, eggs, and such other, almost double above the prices which have been accustomed; by reason whereof a marvelous multitude and number of the people of this realm be not able to provide meat, drink, and cloaths necessary for themselves, their wives and children; but be so discouraged with

misery and poverty, that they fall daily to theft, robbery, and other inconveniences, or pitifully die for hunger and cold. And as it is thought by the King's most humble and loving subjects, that one of the greatest occasions that moveth and provoketh those greedy and covetous people, so to accumulate and keep in their hands such great portions and parts of the grounds and lands of this realm from the occupying of the poor husbandmen, and so to use it in pasture and not in tillage, is only the great profit that cometh of sheep, which now be come to a few persons hands of this realm, in respect of the whole number of the King's subjects, that some have 24,000, some 20,000, some 10,000, some 6000, some 5000, and some more and some less; by the which a good sheep for victual, that was accustomed to be sold for 2s. 4d. or 3s. at the most, now sold for 6s. or 5s. or 4s. at the least; and a stone of clothing wool, that in some shires of this realm was accustomed to be sold for 18d. or 20d. now sold for 4s. or 3s. 4d. at the least; and in some counties where it hath been sold for 2s. 4d. or 2s. 8d. or 3s. at the most, is now sold for 5s. or 4s. 8d. at the least, and so are raised in every part of this realm: Which things, thus used, be principally to the high displeasure of Almighty God, to the decay of the hospitality of this realm, to the diminish∣ing of the King's people, and to the let of the cloth-making, whereby many poor people have been accustomed to be set on work; and in conclusion, if remedy be not found, it may turn to the utter destruc∣tion and desolation of this realm, which God defend.</Q>—By this law, which is still subsisting, no farmer, under a penalty to be levied by Justices of the Peace, should hold more than <HI>two farms,</HI> and they to be in one parish, where he should reside; and no farmer to have above 2000 sheep.</P>
<P>Not only the pleasure her Ladyship takes in promoting Sir John's at∣tention to the improvements of the adjacent lands, she also, I am in∣formed, was a chief cause of the <HI>Iron Manufactory</HI> carried on near <HI>Ford,</HI> being brought to its present significance. About a mile down the river, a <HI>Plating-Forge</HI> was erected in 1769, where a large quantity of shovels, spades, and other plate-iron works are made, as well for home con∣sumption, as for exportation at the ports of Berwick, Newcastle, &amp;c. The scheme, when carried to its intended extent, will be of great con∣sequence to this part of the country. The situation of the <HI>Forge</HI> is ro∣mantic, and the whole scene picturesque. The water to supply the wheels is collected by a dam, and forms a fine canal, from whence it
<PB N="338" REF="351"/>
breaks over the wear in a beautiful cascade; and being intercepted in its lower course by rocks and hillocks, divides itself into several streams. The buildings for the forge, as you look up the river, lay to the left; on the opposite side is a water-corn-mill: the vale seen above the canal consists of cultivated and enclosed grounds, which are highly contrasted by the lofty eminences which bound the prospect, finely broken and irregular, through which the light streams, and gives a singular beauty to the offscape: these at the extreme point of view are overlooked by Cheviot, awfully supreme and majestic, on whose brow heavy vapours are generally seen suspended.</P>

<P>Hubert Delaval and Richolda his mother gave a moiety of that manor to the priory of Hexham.

The abbey of Newminster also had lands in Eche∣wick, by the gift of John de Mitford, 3 King Henry VI.</P>
<P>Roger Fenwick, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> of Bitchfield, second son of Sir John Fenwick of Wallington, by Margery the daughter and heiress of John Harbottle, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> married Ursilla daughter of Sir John Heron of Chipchase, Knt. and purchased of the Crown Echewick Hall with divers lands, to be held by fealty only, as of the manor of East Greenwich, subject to a certain fee-farm rent. In the year 1589, he settled the same on Anthony his second son, whose issue in the male line becoming extinct, the estate, about the year 1670, came to Ralph Scourfield, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> of Newcastle upon Tyne, in right of his mother, who was the daughter of Geo. Fenwick of Newcastle, Merchant Adventurer, younger son of Anthony Fenwick. Ralph Scourfield of Echewick, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> his only son, was High Sheriff for the county of Northumberland A. D. 1684: he died Sept. 1728, and lies buried within the rails of the communion table in the church of St. John, Newcastle.

The ancestors of George Spearman, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> were settled at Preston, in the parish of Tynemouth, for some centuries.

<P>The river anciently made its course due east, until it was within a little way of the sea, and then suddenly made a turn, and discharged itself in a course due north. The sea banks at this point form an angle, one side facing to the north, and the other almost full east. At the point of this angle, Sir Ralph Delaval erected his works, to secure his little haven at the mouth of the river, as mentioned in the foregoing note: but Sir John, in an age much advanced in mechanic knowledge, brought his haven into its present state, by cutting through the rock, from the point where the river anciently turned towards the north, to the sea on the east side of the angle, so that the current now discharges itself into the sea in a straight direction, almost due east, and forms a harbour accessible with every wind, and a moorage secure against every storm.</P>

<P>We passed by the Monks stone, about two miles north-west of Tyne∣mouth. The best account which has yet been given of it, is by Mr Grose, which I shall take the liberty to transcribe. It appears to me to be the ancient boundary mark of the priory district: many obelisks of this kind being fixed on the boundaries of church lands in the northern counties.</P>
<P><Q>A gentleman in the neighbourhood remembers it standing, though in a tottering condition, and much out of the perpendicular: he thinks it was then near ten feet high: it has lately been thrown down and broken; two pieces of it are now remaining, one of which, measuring three feet and a half, has been set up, the other, of about three feet, is the part represented (in Mr Grose's plate) lying on the ground; on the pedestal is the inscription, <HI>O horror, to kill a man for a pigges head:</HI> the characters seem more modern than the obelisk. This monument is of a whin stone; its plan, what is called an ob∣long square: it is injured by time, and besides which, the country people have punched it so full of round holes, and otherwise so defaced it, as not only to render its ornaments unintelligible, but also to make it doubtful, whether all its sides, or only the two broadest were ornamented.</Q> The following traditionary story, relative to this monument, is also given by Mr Grose. <Q>A Monk of this monastery, strolling abroad, came to the house of Mr Delaval, an ancestor of the ancient family of that name, who was then absent on an hunting party, but was expected back to dinner: among the many dishes preparing in the kitchen, was a pig ordered purposely for Mr Delaval's own eating: this alone suiting the liquorish palate of the Monk, and though admonished and informed for whom it was intended, he cut off the head, reckoned by epicures the most delicious part of the animal, and putting it into a bag, made the best of his way towards the monastery. Delaval, at his return, being informed of the transaction, which he looked upon as a personal insult, and

<FIGDESC>depiction of Tynmouth Abbey</FIGDESC>

<PB N="341" REF="355"/>
being young and fiery, remounted his horse, and set out in search of the offender; when overtaking him, about a mile east of Preston, he so belaboured him with his staff, called a hunting gad, that he was hardly able to crawl to his cell. The Monk dying within a year and a day, although as the story goes the beating was not the cause of his death, his brethren made it a handle to charge Delaval with his murther; who before he could get absolved, was obliged to make over to the monastery, as an expiation of this deed, the manor of Elsig, in the neighbourhood of Newcastle, with several other valuable estates; and by way of <HI>amende honourable,</HI> to set up an obelisk, on the spot where he properly corrected the Monk. Elsig was afterwards made the summer retreat of the Priors of Tynmouth.</Q> <Q>This story, like many others of the like kind, is very defective in several parts; no date is affixed, and the above-mentioned monument is shewn in support of it; it seems difficult to account for this Monk being so far from his monastery, especially alone, which was strictly prohibited by their rules: and this not being of the Mendicant order, he could not be going on the quest. The only method of reconciling it, is to suppose that this personage was a lay-brother, and servant to the house. It however shews how dangerous it was to injure the meanest retainer to a religious house: a peril very ludicriously, though justly expressed in the following old English adage, which I have somewhere met with: "<HI>If perchaunce one offende a Freeres Dogge, streight clameth the whole brotherhood, an heresy! an heresy!"</HI></Q></P>

<P>lies to the east end of the town, on a peninsula formed of stupendous rocks, on the north side of the mouth of the river Tyne, against which heavy seas break with great vehemence and tumult. The approach to the priory in its present state is from the west, by a gateway tower of a

square form, having a circular exploratory turret on each corner: from this gateway, on each hand, a strong double wall has extended to the rocks on the sea shore, which from their great height have been esteemed in former times inaccessible. The gate with its walls was fortified by a deep outward ditch, over which there was a drawbridge, defended by moles on each side. The tower comprehends an outward and interior gateway, the outward gateway having two gates at the distance of about six feet from each other, the inner of which is defended by a portcullis and an open gallery: the interior gateway is in like manner strengthened by a double gate. The space between the gateways, being a square of about six paces, is open above, to allow those on the top of the tower and battlements to annoy assailants who had gained the first gate. By dif∣ferent accounts it appears, that there was a place of considerable strength here in very remote antiquity: Camden says, <Q>there are some appre∣hend that the rampier, not the (Roman) wall, went as far as to the very mouth of Tyne, and affirm it was called <HI>Pen-bal-crag,</HI> that is, <HI>the head of the rampier on the rock.</HI> I dare avouch, this was in the time of the Romans <HI>Tunnocellum,</HI> expressing <HI>the promontory of Tunn or Tyne,</HI> where lay the first cohort <HI>Aela Classica,</HI> enrolled (probably from the name) by <HI>Aelius Hadrianus,</HI> the Emperor, and in pay for sea ser∣vices: for the Romans had certain light pinnaces, termed <HI>Luforiae,</HI> upon the rivers.</Q>—What it was in the time of the Saxons, as a forti∣fication, we have little or no evidence to be depended upon. The si∣tuation on the <HI>ostium</HI> of so important a river, and so well calculated for the command of this shore, induced <HI>William the Conqueror</HI> to order it should be converted into a fortress: the religious inhabitants were ill suited to this plan, and the first degradation of this monastery was by WALTHEOF Earl and Governor of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> at the command of his Sovereign, who it is known had very little veneration for religious institutions. At this period it was fortified with the wall and tower before described. <HI>Robert Mowbray,</HI> Earl of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> made choice of it for his stronghold, when he rebelled against King William Rufus. But as it usually happens with rebels, he had ill success: being closely besieged, he withdrew himself into the monastery, and claimed the be∣nefit of sanctuary, a protection presumed to be inviolable in those days. Notwithstanding which, he was dragged forth by the conquerors, car∣ried to Windsor, and held in close durance there for a long time before he was put to death.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Camden.</NOTE> On its being converted into a fortress, it took

the name of Tynemouth Castle; it belonged to the Earls of Northum∣berland from the time of <HI>Waltheof</HI> for several generations. In Peck's <HI>Desiderata Curiosa,</HI> Tynemouth Castle is mentioned in the list of castles, bulwarks, and fortresses garrisoned in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, whereby it appears here was a master gunner and six inferior gunners. In Camden's time it was in good repair: he says, <Q>it is now called Tynemouth Castle, and glories in a stately and strong castle.</Q> It was besieged by the Scots in 1644, when the garrison were obliged to sur∣render to the arms of the Parliament, and submit to their instructions. On this occasion there was delivered up 38 pieces of cannon, a great stand of arms, with stores of ammunition and provision of very consi∣siderable amount. Several of the garrison, (it is said during a violent storm) escaped by the privies. A large sum was appropriated by Par∣liament to restore the injury this fortress sustained in the siege, and <HI>Colonel Henry Lilburn</HI> was made Governor: but he deserting his party, the garrison soon after revolted. <HI>Sir Arthur Hezelrig,</HI> who lay at New∣castle, marched immediately to reduce them, and took the place by storm: the men scaling the walls in the most intrepid manner, at the mouths of the cannon, entered by the embrazures and port-holes; and after a short engagement with the garrison within the fortifications, soon became masters of it. In the conflict <HI>Lilburn</HI> was slain.</P>
<P>On passing the gateway, the scene is strikingly noble and venerable; the whole enclosed area may contain about six acres; the walls seem as well calculated for defence as the gateway tower; the view is crowded with august ruins; many fine arches of the priory are standing; the most beautiful part of these remains is the eastern limb of the church, of elegant workmanship. The ruins are so disunited, that it would be very difficult to determine to what particular offices each belonged. On the south side, adjoining the wall which stands on the brink of the cliff, are several spacious vaulted chambers, one of which I conceived was the kitchen, from the large extended fire-place; another the prison, with an aperture in the top of the vault, by which the miserable cap∣tive descended to his horrid dungeon. On the north and east sides, the cliffs appear to be about 10 perpendicular fathoms in height, at the feet of which, on a broken rocky shore, the sea beats impetuously. From the walls on the south side, you have a view of the batteries which command the mouth of Tyne, with the barracks for the garrison. On the north side, is a house built by <HI>Colonel Henry Villiers,</HI> once Governor of this fortress, together with a light-house, for the benefit of shipping

These erections being made by licence from government, <HI>Villiers</HI> was authorized to receive one shilling for every British vessel, and six-pence for each foreign vessel anchoring in Shields harbour, which produced a revenue of about 80l. per annum: a trifling gratuity for so beneficial a work.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">His Monument in the priory-yard has the following Epitaph:

<P>The ruins which present themselves in front, on entering the gate∣way, appear to be the remains of the cloister, to which you have access by a gateway of circular arches, comprehending several members in∣clining inwards, and arising from pilasters. After passing this gate, in the area many modern tombs appear, the ground being still used for sepulture. The west gate entering into the abbey is still entire, of the same architecture as that leading to the cloister. The ground from the cloister to the south wall is almost covered with foundations of build∣ings, which I presume are the remains of the priory. Two walls of the east end of the church are standing; the end wall to the east con∣tains three long windows; the centre window, the loftiest, is near 20 feet high, richly ornamented with mouldings; some of rose-work, and others of the dancette, as the figure is termed in heraldry, or zig-zag, a decoration common to old Saxon architecture. The divisions or pil∣lars between the windows are enriched with pilasters of five members, with highly finished foliated capitals and cornices. Above the centre win∣dow, is an oval one with like mouldings, and the openings of a gallery on each side. Part of the south side wall of the choir is also standing, illuminated with four windows of like form as those to the east, and equally ornamented, though not of the same height; for above them are an equal number of small windows: the divisions or pillars between the larger windows are decorated with pilasters, of the same kind as
<PB N="345" REF="360"/>
those at the east end; in the divisions or pillars between the smaller windows, spring the groins of the arches which formed the roof, by their remains shewing they were ornamented with rich mouldings. The arches of the windows in this part are circular; the blank arches which are thrown upon the wall beneath the windows are pointed. The architecture through the whole of this part of the building is singularly light and beautiful; the erection consists of a red freestone, which en∣dures the weather well, in this stormy situation.</P>
<P>Beneath the centre window at the east end, is a doorway, of like ex∣cellent workmanship, conducting to a small but elegant apartment, which I conceive has contained the shrine and tomb of St. Oswine. On each side of the door, is a human head, cut in a stile much superior to that of the general taste of the age in which they are supposed to have been executed. The apartment within is 18 feet in length, and nine feet in breadth and height. On the south side is an entrance from the open yard with two windows, on the north side three windows, and a cir∣cular window to the east, so elevated as to give place for an altar be∣neath: there are two niches for statues at the east end, a closet for the vessels for sacred offices, and a bason for holy water: on each side of the window is the figure of a Monk kneeling, and two of the emble∣matical animals commonly depicted with the Evangelists: the side walls are ornamented with pilasters, from whence spring the groins and arches of stone, which in various intersections form the roof; the joinings of which are enriched with circles of carved work, and the interstices of the roof are arched and constructed with thin bricks. The circles con∣tain sculptures of the divine Personages with the Apostles, of workman∣ship far from being despicable, and all the figures are in good preser∣vation. Round each sculpture is a circular belt with a sentence in the old English character, well raised, viz. <HI>Sanct. Petrus ora P. nobis,</HI> &amp;c. each varied by the name of the personage to whom it is inscribed. The centre row consists of four circles; in one is the effigies of <HI>John the Bap∣tist,</HI> with the like sentence; in a second, towards the west, the effigies of our <HI>Saviour,</HI> with a Monk kneeling; in a third, to the east, the effigies of the <HI>Supreme,</HI> with the Lamb bearing an ensign; and in the fourth, a representation of the last judgment, with this sentence: <HI>In die judicii liberare nos.</HI> Above the door is the effigies of our Saviour with a globe in his hand, with <HI>morit P. nobis,</HI> subscribed; on each side of the door, an emblematical figure, as to the east. There are two escutcheons, the dexter one charged with bearings of Vesey, a cross sable; the si∣nister,

the bearings of Brabant and Lucy quarterly.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>In P. Monier's celebrated History of Painting, &amp;c. we have the following remarkable pas∣sages touching the original use of Paintings and Sculptures in the christian churches.</P>
<P>One would have thought that the excellence of designing ought to have been kept up at <HI>Rome,</HI> by reason that from the beginning of the <HI>Christian Religion</HI> the <HI>Christians</HI> made use of painting and sculpture, to represent the histories of the Old and New Testament, to adorn their <HI>churches and tombs.</HI></P>

<P>Saint <HI>Basil</HI> confirms the same thing, and says, that painters do as much by their figures as orators by theirs, and that both equally serve to persuade and raise the contemplators to virtue. —There were some excellent painters among the Greeks in the year 800; for there was nothing more surprizing, nor of greater usefulness, than a piece of the day of judgment done by <HI>Methodius,</HI> which so sensibly affected <HI>Bogoris,</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><P><HI>Curtpal.

<P>This <HI>Methodius</HI> was a Monk and Painter. <HI>Bogoris</HI> employed him to paint a palace he had built. He orderd him in general to draw representations of terror; taking chiefly delight in pictures that represented the combats of hun∣ters with boars, lions, bears, and tygers. <HI>Methodius</HI> finding nothing more terrible than <HI>the day of judgment,</HI> he painted it admirably well, with all its most horrible and amazing circumstances; and above all, the reprobates on the left hand of the judge, and delivered over by his sentence to devils to be dragged into hell. <HI>Bogoris</HI> was so touched at the representation of this picture, that he immediately resolved, without further delay, to turn christian.</P></NOTE> King of the <HI>Bulgarians,</HI> that it converted that prince, and afterwards all his subjects to christianity.</P>
<P>Images in the christian religion began from the time of <HI>Jesus Christ:</HI> the first that was made was by a lady, whereof there is made mention in <HI>St Luke,</HI> cha. 8. v. 46. This holy woman, as an acknowledgement of her cure, erected in the city of <HI>Caesarea</HI> a statue of I. C. It was of brass, and at his feet was the statue of this woman, in a supplicant posture. She was so acceptable to God, that he gave a miraculous virtue to a plant that grew at the foot of this statue, and when it was grown high enough to touch the fringe of this image, it healed all sorts of diseases.<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Ni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Council <HI>2d Act. 4.</HI> S.

Thenceforth he attached himself to the King of Norway, who was ra∣vaging Scotland, and induced him to attempt deposing his own bro∣ther, Harold II. for which purpose he projected a descent at the haven of Tynemouth, from whence they pillaged all the country on the banks of Tyne. Putting again to sea, they entered the Humber, where they committed the most horrid cruelties, burning and laying waste the whole country, and imbruing their hands in a flood of innocent blood. In a little time they were opposed by a body of forces under the com∣mand of <HI>Edwin</HI> and <HI>Morchar;</HI> but in the conflict the Danes were vic∣torious. <HI>Harold</HI> with an army of 60,000 men, soon afterwards engaged the invaders, who were nearly equal in number, at <HI>Stanford Bridge,</HI> near York.

<P><PB N="354" REF="369"/>The badness of the situation, as alledged by <HI>Waltheof,</HI> was amply compensated by an advantage arising from thence: the Monks knew well how to avail themselves of it; the exalted rock on which this mo∣nastery stood, rendered it visible at a great distance at sea, in every di∣rection; whence it presented itself as if reminding and exhorting Sea∣men in danger, to make their vows, and promise masses and gifts to the Virgin Mary and St. Oswin for their deliverance. Vows of this kind were common among the ancients, and are to this day, it is said, made in some catholic states, where the walls of churches are covered with the paintings of ships, boats, and other votive memorials. Erasmus, in his piece intitled the Shipwreck, has very humourously described and ridiculed this custom of bribing heaven in case of sudden emergency. In Germany, below almost every dangerous fall or passage of the Rhine, there is a hermitage, whose Hermit, or his Agent, waits on the pas∣senger in the boat, as soon as it has passed over, requesting alms as a reward for his prayers, to the efficacy of which it is intimated he owes his safety. Something like this perhaps might be practised by the Monks, from which they would receive many emoluments, both in goods and money, for the celebration of masses; especially as the en∣trance into Shields harbour is at certain times both difficult and dan∣gerous.</P>

<P>The first day of our abode here was employed in drawing views of the august remains. The next morning being remarkably serene, awaked me early to revisit the same scene, and enjoy the sea breeze. I walked towards the cliffs—the sun cast a ruddy gleam over a calm ocean —the breeze scarce ruffled the leaping surge—the horizon glowed with clouds tinged with gold and crimson; above which the feint blue of the verge gradually deepened into azure, as the eye advanced towards the zenith—the sea appeared of a pale green, strip'd with silver, as the rays of light fell upon the tracks which were becalmed—the scene was enlivened by a fleet of vessels, 44 in number, of various degrees of bur∣then, which then passed in view—over the foreground of this prospect, the solemn ruins were disposed in melancholy arrangement, wearing a countenance more awful and majestic, from the shadows which the eastern sun occasioned to be cast on them—on the right hand and left, the landskip presented itself full of life and business; and to add to the effects this view had on the mind, the morning drum was heard from the garrison, the hum of the distant voices of busy men, and the sound∣ing of the hollow shore, beat by an advancing tide.</P>
<P>Leaving Tynemouth, we passed within sight of the barracks and batteries to</P>

<P>which is not improperly compared to Wapping: the streets, lanes, and alleys are narrow, dirty, populace, and noisy. It is astonishing what business is incessantly going on here: we were told there lay in har∣bour, even at that season of the year, above 400 sail of ships of consi∣derable burthen. The crews of such a number of vessels, the carpen∣penters, ropers, victuallers, and men concerned in the merchandizing of such a fleet, must necessarily occasion a mighty concourse and bustle: to which being added the family of sailors residing here, makes the place resemble a hive of bees.</P>
<P>Shields has advanced to its present state of populousness, trade, and riches, from a very low estate, within the space of two centuries: the
<PB N="357" REF="372"/>
church was begun to be built in the year 1659: in the beginning of the reign of King Edward I. it consisted only of six fishermen's hovels. By the arguments in a cause depending between the King and his Bur∣gesses of Newcastle and the Prior of Tynemouth, in the 20th year of that reign, it appears, that the Prior had built a town upon the bank of the water of Tyne on one side, and the Prior of Durham another on the other side, where no towns ought to be, only lodges for fisher∣men; and that the fishermen had there sold their fishes, which ought to have been sold at Newcastle: and that both the said Priors had caused to be made breweries and fisheries, having great ships, whereas they ought to have had but boats; and had caused bread to be baked there, which ought to have been baked at Newcastle. It was decreed, that neither at Tynemouth or Shields there be any sale of things saleable, as in meats, drinks, &amp;c. and that ships should not be laden or unladen there. This will serve to shew what was the state of this place in the 13th century.</P>
<P>We took a boat to examine this busy scene upon the water: the sight of so many vessels, and such a concourse of people, is very pleasing: it consequently brings to one's mind, reflections on the powers of human faculties. The genius of man is infinite; if we could be taught for 1000 years, we should discover at that period, from the learning we had acquired, that we had an infinity of subjects yet to learn: for the more knowledge man attains, the wider circle of objects unattained opens upon him. As the scale of numerical calculation is without end; as the variations of musical tones are infinite; so is man's genius. By the use of letters we have accumulated the learning of ages; yet after the conclusion of a few centuries, all our acquisitions will perhaps appear to posterity, as but minute members of the science of mankind. Before the use of letters, with the fall of empires, the accumulated knowledge of ages expired with them; but henceforth it will not be so.</P>
<P>How wonderfully perfect is all maritime science now, to what it was in the most flourishing period of the Egyptian and Phoenician states! We are told the timber for building the temple at Jerusalem was floated in rafts: This shews the force of the shipping then employed. The mariners of antiquity seldom trusted themselves from the sight of the coast. The Grecian and Roman fleets were composed of insignificant vessels, compared with a British navy. The discovery of the magnet has given infinite powers to the Mariner; our geometrical principles
<PB N="358" REF="373"/>
have fitted our vessels for swift sailing and the carriage of great bur∣thens. The ark of Noah was little better than a huge cask rolling on the face of the deep; whose preservation was miraculous, and not me∣chanical, amidst the perils of an universal ocean. The vessels of the Phoenicians were little superior to our lime-boats; their rigging and devices for sailing greatly inferior: and the most excellent of the Roman gallies comparable only to the gilded barges of a Lord Mayor's shew. The most superb vessel we read of in antiquity was constructed by Archimedes: <Q>it was a whole year in building—had twenty benches of oars; the enormous pile was fastened together on all sides with huge nails of copper, that weighed each ten pounds and upwards: the inside had in it three galleries or corridors; the lowest of which led to the hold by a descent of stairs; the second to apartments, and the first to soldiers lodgings.</Q></P>
<P><Q>On the right and left side of the middle gallery, there were to the number of thirty apartments; in each of which were four beds for men. The apartment for the officers and seamen had 15 beds, and three great rooms for eating; the last of which that was at the poop served for a kitchen. All the floors of these apartments were laid with small stories in different colours, taken from the Iliad of Homer. The ceilings, windows, and all the other parts were finished with wonderful art, and embellished with all kinds of ornaments.</Q></P>
<P><Q>In the uppermost gallery there was a gymnasium or place of exer∣cise, and walks proportionate to the magnitude of the ship. In them were gardens and plants of all kinds, disposed in wonderful order. Pipes, some of hardened clay and others of lead, conveyed water all round to refresh them. There was also arbours of ivy and vines, that had their roots in great vessels filled with earth. These vessels were watered in the same manner with the gardens. The arbours served to shade the walks.</Q></P>
<P><Q>After these came the apartments of Venus with three beds. This was floored with agates and other precious stones, the finest that could be found in the island. The walls and roof were of Cyprus wood. The windows were adorned with ivory, paintings, and small statues. In another apartment there was a library, at the top of which, on the outside, was fixed a sun-dial.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="359" REF="374"/><Q>There was also an apartment with three beds for a bath, in which were three great coppers, and a bathing vessel made of a single stone of various colours. This vessel contained 250 quarts. At the ship's head was a great reservoir of water, which held an hundred thousand quarts. All round the ship, on the outside, were atlasses of six cubits or nine feet in height, which supported the sides of the ship: these atlasses were at equal distance from each other. The ship was adorned on all sides with paintings, and had eight towers, proportioned to its bigness; two at the head, two at the stern, and four in the middle, of equal dimensions. Upon these towers were parapets, from which stones might be discharged upon the ships of an enemy that should approach too near. Each tower was guarded by four young men compleatly armed and two archers; the inside of them was filled with stones and arrows.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Upon the side of the vessel, well strengthened with planks, was a a kind of rampart, on which was an engine to discharge stones, made by Archimedes: it threw a stone of 300 weight and an arrow of 12 cubits the distance of a stadium or 125 paces. The ship had three masts, at each of which were two machines to discharge stones. There also were the hooks and great lumps of lead to throw upon such as approached. The whole ship was surrounded with a ram∣part of iron to keep off those who should attempt to board it. All round were iron graplings disposed, which being thrown by the ma∣chines, might catch hold on the enemy's vessel, and draw them close to the ship, from whence it was easy to destroy them. On each of the sides were 60 young men compleatly armed: there were as many about the masts and at the engines for throwing stones.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Tho' the hold of this ship was exceeding deep, a single man could clear it of all water with a machine made in the nature of a screw, invented by Archimedes.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Hiero having found there was no port in <HI>Sicily</HI> capable of contain∣ing this vessel, except where it could not lay without Danger, resolved to make a present of it to King Ptolemy, and sent it to Alexandria.</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is supposed to be Ptolemaeus Philadelphus.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="360" REF="375"/>This was a more unwieldy and ungovernable mass than Noah's ark: the comparison made between them and our shipping, excites no small degree of wonder how they could ever perform the navigation for which they were respectively designed.</P>
<P>What luxury, what ease and splendour doth Britain enjoy, from the labour of her Mariners! things which we have rendered the common necessaries of our lives, are furnished from the distant quarters of the earth! even the very lower classes mix the produce of the East and West Indies for their common meal; our dwellings are decorated from all the regions of the world, and our tables are furnished with the dainties of every climate—the ancient eastern empires did not enjoy one half of our splendour or our luxury.</P>
<P>When I compare this scene of man to the Shepherds haunts on the skirts of Cheviot mountains, I am astonished on each hand: at the wasted life and faculties of the Shepherd, and at the extended powers of the busy race before me.</P>

<P>Give me leave to attempt the recovery of one of the <HI>Roman stations</HI> in this country, both re∣quisite for the security of navigation in the northern seas, and the protection of their frontiers beyond the river <HI>Tyne,</HI> thereby saving the great expence and trouble of building the wall as far as the sea at <HI>Tynemouth,</HI> no less than three miles at least; I mean that near <HI>South Shields,</HI> at the entrance of the said river into the ocean, and which cannot but have flourished till the <HI>Danish invasions,</HI> as <HI>Mr Leland</HI> has it in his <HI>Collectanea, vol.</HI> iv. <HI>p.</HI> 43. <HI>E Regione Tinmuthae fuit urbs vastata a Danis, Urfa nomine ubi natus erat Oswinus Rex.</HI></P>
<P>The communication it had with <HI>Binchester</HI> is visible in several places, as is the angle where the paved way goes off from the <HI>military way</HI> leading to <HI>Lanchester,</HI> about three miles to the north of <HI>Binchester,</HI> and passes to the north-east through <HI>Brancepeth Park,</HI> thence a little to the south of <HI>Brandon,</HI> and is lost in the cultivated grounds, but appearing upon <HI>Durham Moor</HI> in the same direction again, passing by <HI>Haghouse</HI> and below upon <HI>Harbrass Moor</HI> is very visible tending past <HI>Lumley Castle</HI> in a direct line towards <HI>South Shields,</HI> passing about a mile to the east of <HI>Chester in the Street,</HI> without any signs of communication therewith. Two elevated pavements in the river <HI>Tyne,</HI> the one at the west end of <HI>South Shields,</HI> the other on the north side of the river, near the end of the <HI>Roman wall,</HI> proper for their safe landing at different times of the flowing and ebbing tide, fully shews its necessary correspondence with <HI>Segedunum,</HI> the first station upon the wall: but another military way called <HI>Wreken Dyke</HI> passing from this station to the west, has hitherto frustrated the enquiries of our late Antiquaries; <HI>Mr Horsley</HI> himself pointing out its <HI>ductus</HI> very justly over <HI>Gateside Fell,</HI> where it passed the public road, and a little to the west the Roman way going to the south from <HI>Newcastle</HI> to <HI>Chester in the Street,</HI> and afterwards running through <HI>Lamesley</HI> and <HI>Kibblesworth Fields,</HI> advances to the south∣west over <HI>Blackburn Moor,</HI> and through the township of <HI>Hedley;</HI> it comes next to <HI>Causey,</HI> a vil∣lage which owes its name to it, and from thence ascends a high hill, and terminates at <HI>a square fortification</HI> upon the top thereof at <HI>Stanley,</HI> the seat of the Hon. <HI>Sir Nicholas Tempest, Bart.</HI> who I am told possesses several Roman coins found therein.</P>
<P>This place, tho' not above three miles from <HI>Chester in the Street,</HI> and four from <HI>Lanshester,</HI> seems to have had no immediate communication with either of them, no vestigia of any paved way appearing upon the adjoining moors, and being situated as <HI>Chester</HI> itself, at the termina∣tion of a military way, gives me convincing reason to believe the use of each has been the same, namely, to guard <HI>herds of cattle</HI> at grass, for the subsistence of the two garrisons of <HI>South Shields</HI> and <HI>Pons Aelii,</HI> and for victualling ships resorting to the first place; whereas had its elevated situation been intended to form <HI>a castrum exploratorium,</HI> then must the advantage of paved ways to the next stations have been necessary, for the speedy conveyance of intelligence. Tho' this last military way bears the name of <HI>Wreken Dyke,</HI> I am apt to believe that name is rather due to the way leading from <HI>Binchester</HI> to <HI>South Shields,</HI> especially from the authority of <HI>Ranulph Higden,</HI> who says the <HI>Wreken Dyke</HI> or <HI>Reken Dyke</HI> passed from the west of England and ended at <HI>Tinemouth.</HI> I dare not fix a Roman name to this our station without the authority of in∣scriptions.</P>

</LETTER></NOTE> It lay conveniently for the small vessels employed by the Romans on the coast, to scour the seas of pira∣tical rovers. From the ruins, it seems to have had a quay for the con∣venience of merchandize; or perhaps was decorated with some pleasure buildings on the shore. It was the station of the first cohort of the <HI>Lergi.</HI> In the walls of <HI>Mr Cousins's</HI> seat, before it was rebuilt, Mr Horsley observed several Roman inscriptions, which are preserved in his work.
<PB N="362" REF="377"/>
Severus's wall has very manifestly terminated in a square fort or station, above a furlong to the east of the mansion called Cousins's House. The ruins of a Roman station and town at this place are very discernible, though it has all been ploughed, and is now a very rich meadow. The stones and rubbish of the buildings are levelled, and covered with earth and grass, but yet the ramparts of the fort may be distinctly traced out, both they and the ditch being visible, almost quite round.</P>
<P>In Mr Warburton's Vallum Romanum, and Mr Horsley's Brit. Rom. are the following particulars, which I will transcribe, as at the time I visited this station I could not traverse the ground without injuring the crops growing. <Q>There are very evident remains of two turrets at the western and eastern entries to the station, and of another at the south∣west corner. The west entry has been close to the wall, and the eastern one directly opposite to it. The fort has been about 140 yards, or perhaps six chains square, and so the contents of it above three acres and an half. About 60 yards of the western and eastern sides lie without, or to the north of the line of the wall, and eighty within it; so that the wall falls upon the sides of the station, not far from the middle of them. The south rampart of this fort is about three quarters of a furlong from the river side, and runs along the brow of the hill, or at the head of a considerable descent from thence to the river. There have been ruins of buildings on this part and to the south-west of the fort; but they are now so levelled and covered, that little evidence appears above ground; yet the stones and remains of rubbish are easily discovered, when the surface is any where removed: and some of these inequalities in the surface, which usually arise from ruins, yet remain, and may easily be perceived to be hillocks of stones or rubbish.</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Mr Horsley gives the following inscriptions as belonging to this place:</P>
<P>I. Cohortis primae centuria Fiari posuit.</P>
<P>This stone with the five next (as also a piece of an altar and part of a pedestal) are all placed in niches in the outside of the wall belonging to Cousins House, where they have stood unob∣served and neglected for many years, and being exposed to the winds and weather, have suffered very much by that means. I cannot find that the least notice has been taken of them before; the four first are plainly centurial, such as were generally placed in the face of the wall, and are rarely found in any other station. Hence we have one argument, that this station was built at the same time with the wall, in the reign of Severus. The cohorts mentioned in these in∣scriptions were certainly legionary. The mark for the century is very clear and distinct in all of them, and the names of the centurions, as in most others of the same kind, are in the geni∣tive. For which reason, I think, that the mark is not to be read centurio, but centuria, (as it is frequently read in Gruter) and that <HI>posuit</HI> is to be supplied or understood at the end; so that <HI>cohortis primae centuria fiari,</HI> is much the same as to say, such a Captain's company of such a regiment. Indeed <HI>centurio cohortis,</HI> or the centurion of a cohort, does often occur in inscrip∣tions, but does not necessarily imply, that the whole command of the cohort was in a single centurion; for we have also <HI>centurio legionis</HI> and <HI>miles legionis,</HI> which can signify no more than such a person was a centurion or a soldier in such a legion.</P>

<P>This has sustained more damage than the former, by being exposed to the weather; for the number of the cohort is effaced. The mark for the century is also faint, and one of the cen∣turion's names very obscure, but the other name Priscus is plain and clear, the letters being gross, tho' short, and cut very deep in the stone. The former name Siinsus sounds somewhat oddly, but there are many as uncouth in Gruter.</P>
<P>VI. Jovi Optimo Maximo.</P>
<P>A small altar, no other inscription appearing.</P></NOTE> Mr Gordon supposes, that the wall itself forms almost
<PB N="363" REF="378"/>
a right angle, and then is continued down to the side of the river: but it is the western rampart of the station which makes that angle with the wall: nor does this rampart reach the river, though it is likely the town or buildings without the fort may have extended so far. On the north side of the station there are some crooked risings and setlings of the ground, which at first view appeared to me not unlike a round fort or tower, projecting from the station with a triple rampart and ditch. The two closes in which the Roman town and station have stood, are called Wall Lawes. If the name Lawes be owing to the rising ground only, the termination Lawes or Lowes, which signifies hills, so far cor∣responds to the Roman name Segedunum. But as there were two dis∣tinct Tumuli observed by Mr Warburton remaining near a place he calls the Beehouses, and not far from these closes, he apprehends that from them they have borrowed this name; a Lawe or Lowe being one of those names by which Tumuli are frequently expressed. There was an altar and some centurial inscriptions at Cousins's House, in Mr Horsleys time.</P>
<P>The wall having left this station, passes on westward, and at a little distance the remains of a castellum are visible. It is 60 feet square, like those mentioned in the most western parts of this county, it is built close to the wall, and wholly within it, on the south side. From hence the wall passes by Walker or Wallkier or Byker Hill, and thence de∣scends to Ewesburn, where are some ruinous heaps, which may pro∣bably have been the remains of some of the smaller exploratory turrets that have been placed all the way upon the wall. Hence the wall seems
<PB N="364" REF="379"/>
to have passed through the house at Red Barns, and enters Newcastle at Pandon Gate.</P>
<P>Mr Horsley and other authors seem very doubtful of the vestiges of the military way, from the wall's end to Newcastle. Near the Red Barns, and upon the descent from Byker Hill to Ewesburn, they con∣ceived the track where it had gone might in some places be traced, but the appearance was so very faint and obscure, they would not insist upon it.</P>
<P><Q>As for Hadrian's vallum, Mr Warburton says he could no where in all this space discern the least track of it; nor did he ever hear of any traditionary account of its having been there.</Q>—Mr Pennant<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tour in Scotland, vol. II. p. 289.</NOTE> says, <Q>it was supposed to have reached no further than Pons Aelii, or Newcastle, on the east. But by an account he had recently received from Mr Robert Harrison of that town, he found it extended on this side as far as the wall of Severus. A broken stone has lately been discovered at Wall's End with this inscription:</Q>
<Q><L>HADR—</L>
<L>MVR. COND—</L>
<L>HOC. MARM—</L>
<L>POS. COSS D—</L></Q></P>
<P>The distance from the station at the end of the wall to St. Nicholas's church in Newcastle, is exactly three measured miles and five furlongs, and in this space there are three castella all visible: that which should have been next in course, is lost in the station at Newcastle.</P>

The following account of this place and its possessors, I have extracted from the notes of Mr Bourne's History of Newcastle, page 114:</P>
<P><Q>It has been handed down by tradition to the present day, that this was a place of retreat for King John, when he came into this coun∣try; and there are still to be seen the ruins of an ancient building, which carries the name of King John's palace. On the north side of this old building are the remains of a fortification, which 'tis natural to conjecture was built for the safety and security of this house, and consequently this house must have been of some great distinction. Robert de Gaugy was a great man in the reign of King John, and had special trust reposed in him by his Sovereign, and it is not im∣probable when the King came to these parts he lodged at this house.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The present house was built in the year 1713, and is so situated, that on the west it overlooks the Town Moor, Fenham, and part of the lands of the Prior of Tinmouth; on the east it faces the Shields road; on the north it has a most agreeable prospect to the windings of the Ouse burn, of its woods and banks, and of the villages situated on it; on the south it faces the river Tyne.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Hardriding, near Haltwhistle, is the ancient seat of the Ridley fa∣mily: above one of the old doors there a date earlier than the con∣quest appears, and the initial letters of the builder N. R. This was a younger branch of the Ridleys of Willimoteswicke: of which branch was John Ridley, a Major in the service of King Charles I. in the Duke of Newcastle's army.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Bishop Nicholas Ridley was of this branch, and was born <HI>here</HI> (Mr Bourn says) I presume he means at Hardriding. He was educated

<P>As to the two inscriptions you sent me, I will venture to give you my thoughts on them, not doubting but you will excuse me where I differ from you, since what I offer proceeds only from a love of truth, and no spirit of altercation.</P>
<P>The first of them is very curious, as it gives us the name of a <HI>Legatus Augustalis &amp; Propraetor,</HI> hitherto unknown in Britain, and which ought, as I think, to be read as follows.</P>
<P><HI>Numini Augusti et Genio Cohortis secundae Vardullorum Equitatae Miliariae sub Antistio Advento Legato Augusti propraetore F. Tiranus Tribunus dat dedicatque Rite.</HI></P>
<P>To read G R in the 4th line <HI>Gregulium</HI> is not a little doubtful; it cannot well be supposed that the tribune of the cohort would dedicate an alter to the deity of the Emperor, and at the same time to the genius of the common soldiers, exclusive of the genius of the officers, of which he himself was one; and how to read it otherwise is as uncertain, if the letters are G R as in your copy: but if they are C R, as on the altar given us by <HI>Mr Horsley,</HI> Durham, No. 26, in his Brit. Rom. and which you say has C very apparent instead of G, they may denote <HI>Civium Romanorum,</HI> and these <HI>Varduli</HI> a people of Spain, admitted to the freedom of the city of Rome for some extraordinary merit, or by some Emperor's favour, perhaps their country∣man Trajans: this was a privilege frequently conferred on foreigners, even whole towns and nations, and at last communicated by Antoninus Pius <HI>omnibus</HI><NOTE N="*">Vide Span<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. Exercit. de Civ. Rom. apud Graevii Thes. Tom. XI. p. 64. S. C.</NOTE> <HI>in commune subjectis,</HI> by which it seems as if this altar had been erected before this general grant of that Emperor, for it is no great honour or advantage for these Varduli to value themselves upon, if they had enjoyed it only in common with all the rest of the world. <HI>Monsieur Spanheim</HI> observes <HI>Exercit. 1<SUP>ma.</SUP> ad Constitution. Imp. Antonini de Civ. Rom. Quod sub M. Antonino Imp. Civitate donati essent, qui∣cunq. in Romani orbis provinciis aut oppidis delecti essent Milites ut Praesidiarii in Imperii limitibus constituerentur:</HI> this seems contradictory to the first mentioned grant, since it only confers the freedom of the city upon the soldiers in garrison on the frontiers of the empire, and the other gives it to all the subjects of the Roman empire without exception: perhaps the soldiers had this advantage given them at first, and upon finding the encouragement it gave them to defend the countries where they were quartered, it was thought adviseable to admit all the subjects of the empire to the same privilege, to interest them the more in preserving the whole from the attacks of the Barbarians; but there has been no small uncertainty among the learned to which of the <HI>Antonini</HI> this constitution is owing; some attributing it to <HI>Antoninus Pius,</HI> others to <HI>Marcus Aurelius,</HI> and <HI>Mr Spanheim,</HI> with great reason, to <HI>Antoninus Caracalla,</HI> from <HI>Dion Cassius</HI> chiefly, who tells us this privilege was granted by him <HI>Omnibus qui in Orbe Romano erant,</HI> not so much for the honor and advantage of it to the people, as for the filling his treasury, since it made them liable to the payment of several taxes from which they were before ex∣empted; so that the soldiers had this benefit conferred on them for their services, and the rest of the people afterwards most likely to drain their purses.</P>
<P>In Gruter's Thesaur. p. CCCCLV. 6. is mentioned <HI>T. Antistius Praefectus Alae Sulpiciae</HI> C. R. <HI>i. e. Civium Romanorum,</HI> and in page CCCCLIX. 8. <HI>L.

A Cohors Equitata</HI> was composed partly of horse, partly of foot, as <HI>Vegetius</HI> <NOTE N="†">Lib. 11. C. 2.</NOTE> informs us. <HI>Prima Cohors habet mille centum et quinque: Equites Loricator centum triginta duos et appellatur Milliaria.</HI> I must own the <HI>Cohors</HI> in this inscription is called <HI>Secunda Vardulorum,</HI> but that is only in respect to the <HI>Cohors prima Vardulorum,</HI> of which an inscription was found at <HI>Riechester</HI> in Northumberland. This second Cohors of the <HI>Varduli</HI> might however be the <HI>prima auxiliaria</HI> of some legion, perhaps the VI. and in more esteem for some eminent service or fortunate accident than the first, not dignified with the honourable title and privileges <HI>Civium Romanorum,</HI> and perhaps also independent of any legion; and after all, the sole reason why one of these Cohorts was called the <HI>first</HI> and the other the <HI>second,</HI> might have been from the priority of time when they were first raised.</P>

</LETTER></NOTE> but of what importance or magnitude the Roman station was which
<PB N="368" REF="383"/>
occupied a part of this ground, no evidence appears. Camden adopts the name of <HI>Gabrosentum,</HI> which he thinks might be derived from its vicinity to the steeps on the opposite shore of Tyne, as being the haunt of herds of goats. These etymologies are sometimes so constrained, that they rather bewilder than instruct. It is as probable the name of
<PB N="369" REF="384"/>
<HI>Gabrosentum</HI> might from the same cause extend to the cliffs and hills on both sides of the river. The Notitia places <HI>Gabrosentum</HI> within the wall, and makes it the station of the second cohort of <HI>Thracians.</HI> Other An∣tiquaries <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr Hunter, Mr Horsley, Mr Pennant.</NOTE> insist upon its name of <HI>Pons Aelii,</HI> where the Romans had a bridge to the southern shore, and that it was garrisoned by the <HI>Cohors Cornoviorum:</HI> this they attempt to confirm, from the traces of a military road discovered in a lineal direction from the bridge to <HI>Chester-le-street.</HI> Dr. Stukeley conjectures that this was the station <HI>Admurum</HI> of Richard of Cirencester,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Dr Stukely, p. 48.</NOTE> in his Map of <HI>Britania Romana.</HI> No altars or inscrip∣tions have been discovered to ascertain the name. If there was once a Roman station here, every vestigia thereof must long since have been destroyed, by the works of a large populous and ancient town. The remains of the <HI>Roman wall,</HI> or wall of <HI>Severus,</HI> have frequently been discovered by workmen, in digging the foundations of buildings in those parts of the town through which it lay. It passed from the west through the Vicarage gardens, the Groat Market, the north part of St. Nicholas's church, and from thence to <HI>Pandon Gate.</HI> This gate bears singular marks of antiquity; the superstructure is of different workmanship and model from any others on the town wall; the arches are circular, and there appears that natural decay on the whole struc∣ture, which might happen in such a number of years. Camden says, <Q>at Pandon Gate there remains, it is presumed, one of the turrets of the Roman wall, differing in form and workmanship from the others on the walls of the town.</Q> By the dimensions which I took of this gateway, I find it nearly-corresponds with the other ports or gates in the Roman wall. It is said the Carpenters Tower is also of Roman ori∣ginal. The reputed antiquity of <HI>Pandon Gate</HI> is denoted in a proverb of common acceptation: <HI>"As old as Pandon Yates."</HI></P>
<P>We have no authorities to fix the certain aera when or by whom this place was first inhabited from the evacuation of the Romans, or how long it remained deserted after their departure: like other strongholds within the defence of the Roman wall, it is reasonable to conceive it was very early resorted to by the distressed Britons, and was kept up by them as a place of security against the northern rovers. The first name we find it distinguished by in history was <HI>Monkchester,</HI> <Q>which shews that it was noted for being the habitation of religious men.</Q><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Pennant.</NOTE> What society of religious (and whether Saxons or not) took up their
<PB N="370" REF="385"/>
residence here, at what time they first possessessed the place, or when they were expelled, are circumstances unknown: all the evidence re∣maining is the name only. <HI>Bede</HI> in his Ecclesiastical History and Life of St. Cuthbert is totally silent relative to them; and as his residence was at <HI>Jarrow,</HI> situated within a few miles, and he died in 735, the name of <HI>Monkchester</HI> and the residence of those religious must have suc∣ceeded his death. Mr Pennant says, <Q>their destruction must have been early, for the venerable Bede takes no notice of the place. The ruin therefore of this place cannot be attributed to the Danes, whose first invasion did not take place till after the death of that Historian.</Q> It appears to me the argument holds the other way; for had it been the residence of any religious society who suffered persecution, before or in the time of <HI>Bede,</HI> he would have noticed it. Fifty-nine years elapsed between the time of <HI>Bede</HI>'s death and the first descent of the Danes on Northumberland: in this period of time the increase of reli∣gious houses was very rapid, and it is reasonable to conceive such ex∣amples as <HI>Landisfarn</HI> and <HI>Jarrow</HI> had produced, would greatly promote like institutions in their neighbourhood. From Hollinshead's authority we are induced to believe, that on the visitation of <HI>Aldwin, Alfrin,</HI> and <HI>Remfrid,</HI> in 1074, <Q>there was not a monastery remaining in this part of Northumberland, and scarce a church was left standing.</Q></P>
<P>This was a desirable situation for the Danes, when they entered the Tyne: and to that aera I am inclined to fix the destruction of the reli∣gious society which had settled here, and from whose residence the name of <HI>Monkchester</HI> was derived.</P>
<P>In 1080, when <HI>Robert Courthose,</HI> the son of <HI>William the Conqueror,</HI> re∣turned from his Scotch expedition, he halted here to refresh his army; and finding the situation proper for a fortress to command the turbu∣lent Borderers, and the river well adapted for the reception of succours by sea, as well as trade, built a <HI>castle</HI> here, to which he gave the name of <HI>Newcastle,</HI> in contradistinction (it is said) to a small circular tower<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bourne.</NOTE> which the Monks held, or to the Roman turrets on the wall.</P>
<P>From this period we may date the growing importance of the place: the protection of a fortress on the banks of so fine a river, would draw thither a great number of setlers, and trade would soon begin to flourish
<PB N="371" REF="386"/>
under such propitious circumstances. There was so rapid a progress in its improvements, that before the death of King David I. of Scotland, who held it as a member of his <HI>earldom of Northumberland,</HI> it was be∣come a place of great importance, David having founded here two monasteries.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tanner, 391. Keith.</NOTE> Tanner says a nunnery was founded here as early as the conquest.</P>
<P><HI>Newcastle</HI> was defended by a strong wall, and an outward ditch of great depth, now much gone to decay. From Leland's account it appears, that this fortification was begun in the reign of King Edward I. and compleated in the reign of King Edward III. A rich citizen hav∣ing been taken prisoner in the middle of the town, by the hasty irrup∣tion of a hardy band of Scots, who would not set him at liberty with∣out a considerable sum for his ransom, on his return he set about to secure his native place by a wall; his fellow-citizens promoting so important a work for the protection of their merchandize and riches. In the 19th year of the reign of King Edward I. the royal licence for fortification was obtained. But it is the opinion of some that the northern wall was built in the reign of King John, and that the re∣maining part of this fortification began from the above event in the reign of Edward I. <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Grey's Chorograph.</NOTE> The circuit of the wall rather exceeds two miles: <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Two miles and 176 yards.</NOTE> it is defended by towers, the chief of which are of a cemi∣circular figure; machicolated towers are intermixed, but not regularly, which project a little over the wall; and there are also many guerrets.<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">They were decorated with the effigies of men cut in stone placed on the tops of them as though they were watching.

a work. To these gates two were added in more modern times; <HI>Bridge Gate,</HI> which guarded the pass of the bridge, and <HI>Sand Gate,</HI> which opens upon the river's banks. The wall formerly extended between Bridge Gate and Sand Gate, which part some few years ago was taken down to open the quay: an alteration greatly for the convenience of trade. The form of the wall there proved it to be of the most modern date of any part of the fortifications, there being therein many small gates to give access to the quays. Sand Gate had no tower above it as the other gates.</P>
<P>THE GATE OF WALK-KNOWLE is said by some to be of Roman architecture,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The wall upon the Knoul cannot be understood of any other than the Roman wall, be∣cause it had this name from very ancient times, long before the building of the town wall.</P>

<BIBL>Ibid.</BIBL></NOTE></P>
<P>PAMPEDON is the next gate, formerly opening upon an ancient town of that name, which was united with Newcastle by the grant of King Henry III. A. D. 1299, whereby it was ordained, <Q>Et quod praedicta villa Novi castri et terrae &amp; tenemen, predict. in Pampedon unica villa etcet. sunt, et unus Burgus, ad uniend. et concludend. dictam vallam Novi castri in emendationem et augmentationem ejus villae, &amp;c.</Q> It is said that in <HI>Pampedon</HI> was <HI>a palace of the Saxon Kings of Northumberland.</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Pennant, Bourne.</NOTE> This gateway was defended by folding gates of iron:<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Wallis.</NOTE> the present ascent to the top of the wall is by stairs two
<PB N="373" REF="388"/>
yards wide. From the remains of the superstructure it is not, at this time, possible to gain any certain idea of the form or capaciousness of the Roman turrets.</P>
<P>The part of the wall which extends from Sand Gate to <HI>Pampedon,</HI> and from thence to the <HI>Austin Fryers Tower,</HI> is pointed out by Mr Wallis, as being the work of the Burgher, who was surprized by the Scots. King Edward III. granted to the Corporation the duties and customs of the town for the term of seven years, to enable them to compleat the fortification; but finding them negligent of a work of such importance, he revoked the grant, and constituted <HI>Henry de Percy, Ralph de Nevil, John de Fenwick, John de Creyk, and Robert de Fenwick,</HI> then Sheriff of Northumberland, Commissioners for keeping the town; after which the franchises were not restored to the Burgesses 'till they consented to perfect the work at their own costs.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Wallis.</NOTE> In the reign of King Henry VIII. this place is said to have exceeded in the strength and magnificence of its works, all the cities of England, and most places in Europe.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Leland's Itin.</NOTE></P>
<P>A small tower called <HI>Corner Tower.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Austin Tower</HI> succeeds next in course, said to be built by the Friars of the order of St Austin for defence of their monastery, which stood near to it. It is now the hall of the <HI>Ropers Company,</HI> who re∣paired it A. D. 1698.</P>
<P><HI>Carliol Tower</HI> is next, deriving its name, as it is conjectured, from one of the family of <HI>Carliols,</HI> who were ancient burgesses here. Nicholas carliol was mayor in the second year of the reign of King Edward II. during whose mayoralty perhaps this tower was erected. It was re∣paired A. D. 1682, and fitted up as a hall for the Company of <HI>Weavers.</HI></P>
<P>The next in succession on the wall is <HI>Pilgrim-street Gate,</HI> being the great passage of <HI>Pilgrims</HI> to the shrine of the Virgin Mary at <HI>Jesmond,</HI> or Jesus Mount: as being one of the principal approaches from the north, this is a very strong edifice, flat roofed with embrazures, a port cullis and iron gates. A. D. 1716 it was repaired and made the hall of the Company of <HI>Joiners.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="374" REF="389"/><HI>Ficket Tower</HI> is next, of which nothing remarkable is noted by Bourne and others.</P>
<P><HI>Bertam Mon Coucher</HI> tower is next. A person of this name was High Sheriff of the county of Northumberland in the 40th year of of King Edward the Third's reign, and for three successive years in the reign of King Richard II. but in what manner he was a contribu∣tor to these fortifications, or how this tower happened to take his name is not known.</P>
<P><HI>New Gate</HI> is next, the common prison, for which use its works are constructed of superior strength. The original gate was supposed to be one of the most ancient parts of this fortification, the Roman towers excepted. The present edifice is modern, the north front being orna∣mented with a statue of King Charles II. two wings were added within this century, one A. D. 1702, the other A.

<P><HI>West Gate</HI> is a considerable edifice, excellently constructed, and very strong: it is defended by a port cullis and iron grated gates. This building is attributed to Roger Thornton, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><L>At the West Gate came <HI>Thornton</HI> in,</L>

<P><HI>West Spital Tower,</HI> or Saint Mary's, it is said was built by the master and brethren of St Mary's Hospital.</P>
<P>The building of <HI>Nevil Tower</HI> is attributed to one of the great <HI>Nevils, Earls of Westmoreland:</HI> their family mansion stood near it. This Tower was repaired A. D. 1711, for the <HI>Masons, Bricklayers, and Plaisterers</HI> hall.</P>
<P>In the next place is a <HI>Postern,</HI> called <HI>White Friar Gate:</HI> a convenient passage for the <HI>Carmelites</HI> or White Friars to and from their monastery.</P>
<P>Not far from thence is the <HI>White Friar Tower,</HI> built on the summit of a vast eminence above the street called the <HI>Close:</HI> its form is circular: it is flagged on the top and embrazured; from thence you have the most extensive prospect any part of these fortifications commands: you view the whole of the upper town and great part of the lower, a vast
<PB N="376" REF="391"/>
tract of country down the river, and a landscape as beautiful and ex∣tensive towards the west and north as any in this part of Northumber∣land. This building is attributed to the House of Carmelites, which stood immediately opposite: its eminence is such, that from the Close Gate you ascend to it by 140 steps. The inner part of the tower con∣tains the Masons hall.</P>
<P>The <HI>Close Gate</HI> is near the present extremity of the wall, on the banks of Tyne. I am inclined to conceive the ancient fortification of this town did not consist of an entire circumvallation, but that the walls terminated in two points as they approached the river near to Close Gate and Sand Gate.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The town after the compleating of the walls was divided into 24 wards, according to the number of the gates and round towers in the wall, which towers and gates were wont to be defended in times of hostility with the Scots by the particular wards appropriated to them.</P>
<BIBL>Bourne.</BIBL></NOTE></P>
<P>Having described the walls, I must in the next place consider the interior fortress.</P>
<P>The <HI>Castle,</HI> all authors agree, was built by <HI>Robert Carthouse,</HI> son of William the Conquerer, in the year 1080, on his return from his Scotch expedition: he perceived the great consequence of such a for∣tress on the frontiers, commanding so fine a river, and in a situation excellently calculated for assembling the northern levies on any dis∣turbance on the borders. The tower built by <HI>Robert</HI> was of great strength, square, and surrounded by two walls: the height of the tower is 82 feet, the square on the outside 62 feet by 54, the walls 13 feet thick, with galleries gained out of them: there was a chapel within the tower.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Pennant.</NOTE> The outward fortifications are now defaced, and their scite crowded with buildings. The tower still remains entire, the corners projecting from the plane of the square, a mode much practiced in the Norman structures. It is situate on a lofty eminence, commanding the whole town: the principal entrance is on the south. What num∣ber of gates were in the outward wall we cannot now determine, but from Bourne's account of it, which I shall quote in its proper place: the area inclosed by this wall contained three acres and one rood. The Castle belongs to the county of Northumberland, and makes no part of the liberties of Newcastle, or its Sheriffdom: the government of it, 21st September, 1st of King Henry VII. was granted to William
<PB N="377" REF="392"/>
Close, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> for life as Constable; and in the 9th year of the same reign it was granted to Roger Fenwick, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> with 20l. per annum salary; since which time I do not find that any Constable has been appointed, but the Sheriffs of Northumberland had custody of the Castle. It now serves for the county prison, and in the great hall the Judges of assize hold the gaol delivery.</P>
<P>Soon after the building of this castle, it is said by Bourne that <HI>Robert de Mowbray</HI> Earl of Northumberland, when in rebellion against King William Rufus, was besieged therein, and this fortress after suffering much damage was taken: but I confess I do not find sufficient autho∣rities to support this assertion of my author, and think it is much to be doubted. The Scots by treachery A. D. 1135, in the 1st year of the reign of King Stephen, gained possession of the castle and town, which they held to the year 1156, when Malcolm IV. ceded the northern counties to King Henry II.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>In the 3 yere of Henry the 2. the King of Scottes had the Erledom of Lancastre yn his handes, the cite of Cairluel, Bamburgh Castel and Newcastel.</P>

<P>The castle having suffered much by neglect in that and the succeed∣ing reign, King John restored it, and added a ditch to the fortifica∣tions, in doing which he was obliged to destroy several houses: as a compensation to the owners of these tenements he ordered 110s. 6d. rents in escheats to be paid yearly, as is set forth in his charter to the town.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The records have of late years been strictly kept, and much interest must be used to have access to the archieves: to me, whose intention was chiefly to make a descriptive view, such applications were not of such moment as they are to the learned compiler from whom we may in a little time hope to receive a compleat <HI>History</HI> of Newcastle.</NOTE> This castle was considered of such consequence, that most of the neighbouring Baronies paid considerable sums towards its support, under the articles of Castleward and Cornage: the several sums are mentioned in Bourne's history.<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><LIST>

<P><PB N="378" REF="393"/>Bourne says, <Q>In the 9th of King Edward III. an inquisition was taken at this town, whereby it was found that at the time of the battle of Bannockburn, which was in the year 1313, when John de Kenont, Knight, was High Sheriff of Northumberland, the Castle and all its edifices about it were in good repair: that after that time Nicholas Scot, Adam de Swinburn, William Riddel, Johannes de Fenwick, Cuthbert de Broughdon, Johannes de Fenwick, Johannes de Woodhorn, Johannes de Lilleburn, Willielmus de Tynedale, Roger Mauduit, and Robertus Darreius, were High Sheriffs of Northum∣berland, during which time the great tower, and also the lesser ones of the said Castle, the great hall, with the King's chamber adjoining to it, together with divers other chambers below in the Queen's mantle, and the buttery cellar and pantry: the King's chapel within the castle, a certain house beyond the gate which is called the chequer house, with the bridges within and without the gate, with three gates and one postern, were 300l. worse than before. They also say that there are in the custody of Roger Mauduit, late High Sheriff, 420 fother of lead: they say also, that it was thought highly necessary that the Baron Heron of Huddeston, the Baron of Walton, Lord Robert Clifford of the New Place, Chief Lord of the Barony of Gaugie, the Lords of the Barony of — and Devilston, that the Lord of Werk upon Tweed, the Lord of the Barony of Bol∣beck alias Bywell, the Baron of Bothal, and lastly the Baron of Delaval, should build each of them a house within the liberties of the castle for the defence of it.</Q></P>
<P><Q>There were two great strong walls which surrounded the castle: the interior wall was of no great distance from the castle itself, as may be still seen in several places. The exterior wall surrounds the verge of the castle borders. From this outer wall were four gates, the great gate and three posterns. The north side of the castle is the main gate, called now the Black Gate; it had two port culicesses, one without the gate, as may be still seen, and another within it, at a little dis∣tance from it, the ruins of which were to be seen a few years ago. There still remains a piece of the old wall, which shews its situation to have been where that house is, which was lately purchased by Mr Jasper Harrison. The shop belonging to this house was dug (as I am informed) out of the wall just now mentioned. On the east side of the castle there was a postern, which led down to the street called the Side, which is still to be seen: it was once called (but many years
<PB N="379" REF="394"/>
after it was in decay) the Waist of Laurentius Acton. On the south side of the castle is another gate, which leads down the Castle Stairs to the street called the Close: this was the south postern. There is a building upon it, which was the county Goaler's house. On the west side was the postern facing Bailiff Gate; now the dwelling-house of James Lidster.</Q></P>
<P><Q>There is an house in the yard, which they say was the chapel of of the garrison, which is called the chapel house to this day: it stands north-east from the chapel; its common name now is the Three Bulls-heads.</Q></P>
<P>By an inquisition taken in the reign of King James I. it appears this castle was then much out of repair; and in the 18th of the same reign another having been taken, complaint was made that a great dunghill, heaped up against the wall on the west side of the castle, had done damage to the amount of 120l. it was under the same inquisition com∣plained, that the great square tower was full of chinks and crannies, and that one-third of it was almost taken away; that all the lead and coverings which it had of old, were embezzled and carried off, inso∣much, that the prisoners of the county of Northumberland were most miserably lodged, by reason of the showers of rain falling on them. The computation made for repairs was 809l. 15s. In 1644, the dung∣hill was taken away by Sir John Morley, and it is said was used to make a rampart on the town walls against the Scots: he also repaired the round tower under the Moothall, now called the Half-moon.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Wallis</NOTE></P>
<P><Q>It has been (continues Bourne) a building of great strength, and no little beauty; the vast thickness of the walls speaks the one, and the ruins of some curious workmanship the other. The grand en∣trance into the castle was at the gate facing the south, which leads up a pair of stairs (which still shews the magnificence of the builder) to a very stately door of curious masonry. The room this leads into, has its floor broken down close to the castle wall, as indeed all the other floors are, to the top of the castle; so that excepting the floor above the county gaol, there is not one left, though there have been five divisions or stories of the castle, besides this. This floored room, which I was told was lately flagged by the order of William Ellison,

<ABBR>Esq</ABBR> when he was Mayor in 1722, seems to me, without any doubt, to have been the common hall of the castle, because on the north side of the same room, there is an entrance by a descent of some steps into a room, where is the largest fire place I saw in the castle, which plainly speaks it to have been the kitchen. At the end of this there are several stairs, which lead into a place under the kitchen, which I think goes down as low as the bottom of the castle: this I take to have been a cellar, as I do also that little dark place on the right hand coming up again, to have been a sort of pantry. The door I mentioned just now on the east of the castle, which leads to the first broken down floor, is because of its grandeur and beauty, an argument that this room has been the most stately one in the whole castle: another reason for its being so is, because of the win∣dows which gave light into it; those of them that face the east are the most beautiful of the whole castle beside. On the south of this room there is an entrance into a sort of a parlour or withdrawing room, which has a fire place in it, and has been a piece of curious workmanship, as is visible to this day; and this place has no com∣munication with any part of the castle but this room. On the north side of this room, is a door leading into an apartment where stands a well of considerable depth; it was 18 yards before we touched the surface of the water; which seems to have been placed there on pur∣pose for the more immediate service of this room. There are some little basons on the top of the well, with pipes leading from them, which conveyed water to different apartments of the castle: this is plain from what may be observed in the county gaol, at the bottom of the castle; the round stone pillar in it having an hollow in the middle, of a foot wide, with a lead spout in the side of it.</Q></P>
<P><Q>In the inquisition made in the 9th of King Edward III. above men∣tioned, among other things that were complained of for being ne∣glected, one was, Capella Domini Regis infra castrum. This chapel, I have been told, stood on that part of the castle yard where the Moot∣hall is; but upon searching, I found it in the castle itself, according to the account of it just now mentioned. The door of it is at the bottom of the south wall of the castle, adjoining to the stairs which lead into the state chamber. It has been a work of great beauty and ornament, and is still, in the midst of dust and darkness, by far the most beautiful place in the whole building; the inside of it being cu∣riously adorned with arches and pillars. It is easy to observe the dif∣ferent
<PB N="381" REF="396"/>
parts of it, the entrance, the body of it, and the chancel: on the left side of the entrance you go into a dark little room, which undoubtedly was the vestry; the full length of it was 15 yards, the breadth six yards and a half; it had three or four windows towards the east, which are now all filled up; nor is there any light but what comes in at a little cranny in the wall. Nicholas de Byker tenet terras suas, ut faciat districtiones ad Ward. novi castri super Tynam faciend. et pro deb. Domini regis inter Tynam et Coquet, &amp;c. and then my authority goes on to say, that the manor of Byker was Sir Ralph Lawson's, Knt. deceased, after of Henry Lawson, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> his son, and now of his eldest son, who without all question is Bailiff by in∣heritance of the said castle, and is to levy these castle wards, cornages, &amp;c. and other rents, issues, fines, and amerciaments belonging to the said castle.</Q></P>
<P><Q>In the 17th of King James I. 1619, a grant was made of the scite and demesnes of the castle to Alexander Stevenson, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> who was succeeded by one Patrick Black, who died and left it in the possession of his wife. After that one James Langton claimed Patrick Black's right, but by virtue of what is not known.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The liberties and privileges of the castle extend northwards to the river of Tweed, and southward to the river of Tees.</Q></P>
<P>In the year 1737, 10 King George II. the scite and demesnes of the castle were granted to George Liddell, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> for 50 years, from 2 July, 1736: rent 100 chaldron of coals for Greenwich Hospital.</P>

capital Bailiff 1269; but the scite of it was given by three sisters, whose names have long since been ungratefully buried in oblivion.</Q></P>
<P><Q>When was the particular time of its building, I have met with no account; but it is not difficult to give a probable guess. The order itself, of the Dominicans or Black Friars, came into England in the year 1221; consequently it must have been founded after that time: and that it must have been founded some years before the year 1280, is plain to a demonstration; for in that year, which was the 8th of King Henry I. the Black Friars had licence from the King, to break a door through this new or town wall into their garden; which proves them a regular settled body at that time; and therefore that their priory was built some years before that licence.</Q></P>
<P><Q>We are told that this monastery was in old time called the Grey Friars, which, in my opinion, is a thing highly improbable; for the Grey Friars or Franciscans came not into England till about the year 1224; and if, as I have proved above, the Black Friars were a set∣tled body some years before 1280, how is it possible, to have been called of old time, the Grey Friars? This is therefore a mistake: and besides, the Dominicans came into England before the Franciscans or Grey Friars, and therefore more probably were sooner in this place.</Q></P>
<P><Q>It has been a very stately building, as appears by the present re∣mains of it. The area or grass plot is about 87 feet in length, and as many in breadth. On the east side of it was the chapel, which is now the hall of the company of Smiths in this town. On the west side of it, is a curious old well, which served the monastery with water, called our Lady's Well. On the south may still be seen, the ruins of a curious front, on which side is the hall of the Cordwainers; in which I saw a pair of winding stairs, which they told me (before they were walled up) led by a vault as far as the nunnery of St. Bar∣tholomew. On the north of it were their gardens, a part of which was the Warden's Close, before the building of that part of the town wall. This appears by the charter granted to the monastery in the reign of Edward I. about the breaking out that narrow gate in the wall between Westgate and Newgate; in which grant it is said, that the wall went through the middle of their garden. The monastery was dependant on the priory of Tynemouth.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="385" REF="400"/><Q>In the reign of Edward II. the brethren of this monastery had li∣cence granted them for the building of a draw bridge beyond the new ditch of the castle.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Who were the Priors of this monastery; what eminent men be∣longed to them; or what things were transacted by them from their beginning till their dissolution; were things undoubtedly preserved among themselves whilst they were a body; but after their surrender, were either destroyed, or have not yet come to light.</Q></P>
<P><Q>One of the Priors of this monastery was one Richard Marshall. I take this gentleman to have been the last Prior of this monastery; for in the 28th of King Henry VIII. a grant of a tenement near the White Cross (signed by Friar Richard Marshall, Doctor and Prior; and Friar David Simpson, and Friar John Sourby) was given to An∣thony Godsalve, upon his paying to the said priory or monastery 9s. per annum. This grant is now in the possession of Mr Thomas Mar∣shall of Newcastle, Joiner, who purchased this tenement, and has lately rebuilt it. He pays the same rent to the town of Newcastle, which the tenement paid to the monastery. About two years after the signing of this deed, in January, the 30th of this reign, this mo∣nastery surrendered. It consisted of a Prior and 12 Friars.</Q></P>
<P><Q>What became of the brethren of this friary, after their surrender; what they had allowed them annually for a maintenance; or whether they had any thing allowed at all does not appear. Some account in∣deed I met with afterwards of the Prior himself, but none of the Friars.</Q> It is this which follows.</P>
<P><Q>Richard Marshall, Prior of the Black Friars in Newcastle about the year 1551, went into Scotland and preached at St. Andrew's, that the Pater-noster should be addrest to God and not to the Saints. Some Doctors of the university being disgusted at this assertion, pre∣vailed with one Tofts, a Grey Friar, to undertake to prove that the Pater-noster might be said to the Saints; whose ignorance in doing the same was so manifest, that he became the common jest, and quitted the town.</Q></P>
<P><Q>After the surrender of this monastery, the Black Friars was granted to the town of Newcastle, in consideration of 53l. 7s. 6d. The annual value of it was 2l. 19s. 6d.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="386" REF="401"/><Q>The King says in his grant, that he gives to the Mayor and Bur∣gesses of Newcastle, the whole house and scite lately a priory, or house of brethren, called vulgarly the Black Friars, in Newcastle upon Tyne; the chapel-houses, edifices, gardens, &amp;c. the hall, two chambers, a chamber called the Cross Chamber; and two gardens with their ap∣purtenances; and the whole close within the Westgate, and another close near the scite of the said priory, on the north; and a close con∣taining three acres, and a house in the same close, without the walls of the said town; and a house called the Gatehouse situated near the said street. It also appears from the first grant, that the King re∣served to himself and successors the bells and lead that was upon the church belonging to this friary, and the other buildings of it; the lead in the gutters, together with the stones and iron of the church, &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The Nine Crafts of this town had their meeting-houses or halls in it, and still have except two of them, the Taylors and the Cordwainers, who have bestowed these upon some poor widows, and got themselves others in their places. These halls are of great service to this ancient building, in preserving it from intire ruin. Such is the hall of the Smiths, which was repaired by them in the year 1709: the hall of the Dyers; the hall of the Bakers and Brewers, which was repaired by them in the year 1711: these halls are on the east side of the friary. Such also are those on the west side of it, viz. the hall of the Sadlers, which was repaired by them in the year 1729, and the hall of the Skinners and Glovers, which was repaired by them in the year 1721. Such are those also on the south side of it, viz. the Cordwainers hall, which was turned into apartments for three widows in the year 1729: the hall of the Butchers and the hall of the Tanners were repaired in the year 1717.</Q></P>
<P><Q>By the means of these halls, there is still some visage of the friary remaining, which had otherwise been intirely in dust. 'Tis a pity that those people, who are permitted by the companies to reside in some of those rooms, are not threatened into more cleanliness;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This still remains a matter of complaint, for it is abominably filthy; and the curious pass through it amidst those unseemly annoyance of which some animals are peculiarly delicate in their concealment.</NOTE> and that the companies themselves are not at the expence of repairing the area.

<P>By Tanner's Notitia it appears, that King David I. of Scotland, who was possessed of Newcastle as Earl of Northumberland, founded here two monasteries and a nunnery: but whether any of the before mentioned own their rise to him, no evidence remains. He died A. D. 1153.</P>
<P>Patents were made out for founding two other religious houses; one 37 King Edward III. in honour of the nativity and resurrection of our Lord, which was repealed; and another, 5 King Henry IV. in honour of St. John Baptist and St. John Evangelist, which latter was also re∣pealed or otherwise proved abortive.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Wall 211.</NOTE></P>
<P>Besides these religious foundations, there were several on a more meritorious plan—hospitals for the benevolent purpose of relieving the miseries of human life. When that dreadful distemper the leprosy raged here, the great and opulent, from true principles of religion and piety, erected those places of consolation and relief for miserable mor∣tals, who were expelled from society on account of this horrible visita∣tion. King Henry I. founded an hospital here for the reception of lepers, called the Hospital of St. Mary Magdalen, situated near Barras Bridge, without Pilgrim-street Gate, and therein fixed a Master, Bre∣thren, and Sisters. After that malady abated, or was subdued, it was appropriated for the reception of poor persons, when the town was vi∣sited with a pestilence—a dreadful scourge, which the Almighty has now withheld from this land for a considerable time. On such occa∣sions, 14 within the house were allowed each a room, 8s. per month, and coals: 15 without the house had different allowances, according to the state of their wants; some 8s. per month, some 5s. others 2s. 6d. In the reign of King Edward III. Laurentius Acton had the first fruits, amounting annually to 200 marks; one John Bland was then Master, and was a considerable patron to this foundation, having built the con∣sistory, and ornamented the chapel. He died A. D. 1374, and was in∣terred in his own chapel, near the high altar, after having presided over the hospital five years. It was a donative in the patronage of the Corporation, and stood without Pilgrim-street Gate, near the Barras

<P>The hospital of St. Mary, commonly styled St. Mary the Virgin, was situated in Westgate-street, had several patrons, but it is not certain who was the original founder. There is some confusion in our autho∣rities touching this hospital, as will appear by the notes. Walter de Bolbeck was a benefactor to the first foundation, which Bourne thinks took date in the reign of King Henry I. One Aselack, of Killinghow, was the second founder, in the time of King Richard I. as appears by his charter: <Q>Ego Aselack, &amp;c. fundavi hospitale Sanctae Mariae Vir∣ginis, &amp;c. &amp; ibi posui duos fratres regulares &amp; unum capellanum ad ferv. &amp;c.</Q> Eustacius, Parson of Benton, one of the witnesses, was incumbent about 1190. The third foundation was by the Corporation, or as Bourne says, by the inhabitants of Newcastle, for a Master and Chaplain to say divine service for six Bedes folks in the alms-house, &amp;c. its revenue was 33l. 15s. per annum. It was besides instituted as an asylum for the helpless stranger and indigent traveller, a receptacle to the sick and needy, and to give sepulture to such as died there. It had an annual allowance of nine chaldron of coals. King Edward III. gave thereto 100s. as a compensation for the damage it sustained in the Scotch incursions.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P>Mr Wallis gives the following list of ornaments belonging to the chapel.</P>

<P>It appears, that Pearson, Lecturer of St. Nicholas about 1606, was paid quarterly a salary out of the town of Newcastle, and likewise for several years after during his continuance.</P>
<P>It appears, that Shaw was about 1614 Lecturer of St. John's, and had a salary quarterly paid him out of the town, and the like for several years after during his continuance.</P>
<P>Fran. Grey, about 1622, was Lecturer of St. Andrew's, and had also a salary quarterly paid him out of the town, and the like for several years after during his continuance.</P>
<P>There were Lecturers of All saints about the same time, as Dr. Jennison and others, who had also a salary paid them out of the town, and continued in the like manner till the late civil wars.</P>
<P>The salaries were not one and the same, but added and increased as the town thought fit. Upon this first settlement they had those salaries out of the town for preaching in the forenoon, and the parishes contributed for their preaching in the afternoons. Some time after the town of Newcastle made an addition to the former salaries, and gave them an allowance for preach∣ing both forenoon and afternoon: after which augmentation the parishes gave no further con∣tribution. In this state have the Lectureships continued ever since, with an alteration still of salaries, more or less, as there was occasion, and at the will and pleasure of the patrons: and when any vacancy happened in any of the said churches, the Mayor, Aldermen, and Common Council of Newcastle, have from time to time chosen another in such room and stead, and the Bishop of Durham for the time being did always hitherto allow and approve of, by his licence, such person so chosen, being duly qualified.—Note the Lecturers of St. Nicholas and All-saints have this further advantage in it, which makes it the more valuable, that this preferment does no ways disqualify or incapacitate them from holding other livings with the cure of souls</P>

with pinnacles of extraordinary beauty: the whole has the most uncom∣mon and pleasing appearance, not unlike a magnificent imperial crown. It is justly allowed by all travellers to be the finest piece of masonry of the kind in Europe. This tower, most authors agree, was built in the time of King Henry VI. by one Robert Rhodes.

<P>Bourne tells the following remarkable Story: <Q>That when the Scots besieged the town in the civil wars, and made ineffectual efforts to reduce it, they sent a message threatening to destroy this fine steeple: in consequence of which, the Mayor ordered it to be filled with Scotch prisoners then in the town, which being made known to the besiegers, they forbore to shed the blood of their countrymen, and the elegant edifice was saved.</Q></P></NOTE> from thence it is conjectured by several that this was the name of the founder.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Pennant, vol. 2. p. 308.</NOTE> The church is well illuminated; the east or altar window was anciently adorned with paintings on the glass, representing the twelve Apostles, and the seven <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">The chief of which were, the building of Westgate; the Town House and Exchange; St. Catharine's Hospital; Monastery of Carmelites at Walk Knowle; a Chantry in the church of All-saints, value 6l. per annum, dedicated to St. Peter; and another in the same church, de∣dicated to St. Catharine, value 5l. 3s. 8d. and this Window.</NOTE> acts of charitable munificence of Roger Thornton, who built the window; in which was the following inscription: Orate pro anima Rogeri de Thornton, et pro animabus filiorum &amp; filiarum.<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Wallis.—Gray's Chorographia inter Collectan.

It has six musical bells and a good organ.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The name and arms of Robert Rhodes are on the steeple.</P>
<P>There is a thing at the top of the quire, which though little known is yet of great certainty, and that is, the <HI>funnel or wood box</HI> in the form of a spout, which hangs from the top of this quire. This was a conveyance for an artificial dove on the day of Pentecost, to represent the descent of the Holy Ghost. That there were such things in churches, though in none that I know of in this town but this, is matter of fact. For thus we are told, that on Whitsunday they began to play a new interlude, then sent down a dove out of an owls nest devised in the roof of the church; but first they cast out rosin and gunpowder, with wildfire, and that must needs be the Holy Ghost which cometh with thunder and lightning.</P>

<P>Besides the grammar school before mentioned, there are four paro∣chial charity schools.</P>
<P>The grammar school was founded by Thomas Horsley, Mayor of Newcastle, A. D. 1525: he endowed it with lands of a considerable yearly value. Queen Elizabeth confirmed this foundation, or rather refounded it by charter. The great tithes of the parish of Bolham ap∣pertain
<PB N="401" REF="416"/>
to it, and the Mastership of St. Mary's Hospital is generally annexed. The Master of the school hath a convenient dwelling-house belonging to it.</P>
<P>The charity school of the parish of St. Nicholas was opened in 1709, for the teaching and cloathing of 40 boys and 20 girls, of this parish and the chapelry of St John's. The boys are placed out to business, and have on such their going out a gift of certain religious books and 40s. in money. The girls are placed out to service, and have a like gift of books and 20s. in money. The Schoolmaster's salary is 25l. and 20s. for coals yearly. The Mistress has 10l. and 10s. for coals.</P>
<P>This school was originally founded by Mrs Eleanor Allan, a widow of Newcastle, and endowed with lands of 60l. a year value. Mrs Crishold, the widow of the Rev. Mr Crishold of Wooler, added a donation of 500l. By a parochial subscription the children are cloathed on the 1st day of May yearly.</P>
<P>The charity school belonging to the parish of All-saints is supported by subscription, which was begun A. D. 1709. It receives 41 boys and 17 girls, and is conducted as the school of St. Nicholas.</P>
<P>The charity school of the parish of St. Andrew was founded by Sir William Blackett, Baronet, for 30 boys, and was opened A. D. 1707: the Schoolmaster's salary 20l. a year.</P>
<P>The charity school of the parish of St. John was founded in the year 1705, by John Ord, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> for 44 boys. He endowed it with lands near Pilgrim-street Gate. Mrs Margaret Allgood gave thereto 100l. The boys are cloathed annually on Midsummer-day, by subscription. The Schoolmaster's salary is 24l. a year, and 40s. for teaching them to sing; with an additional allowance of 16s. a year for pens, ink, and paper.</P>
<P>Besides the principal edifices before mentioned, there are several pub∣lic buildings here.</P>
<P>The Town House and Exchange, on the Sandhill, originally founded by Roger de Thornton. In the year 1658, this public edifice was re∣built by the Corporation on the present plan;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The Exchange contains a variety of apartments, and also the Courts of justice for the town. Is of the architecture of the period of James I. The builder Robert Trollop is buried opposite to it in the church-yard of Gateshead. His statue pointing towards the Exchange, stood formerly over his grave, with these lines under his feet.</P>

<P>The story of the statue is believed to be fabulous: an anonymous writer has said lately in his strictures on the above publication, that the Epitaph has always been said to be made by Daniel De Foe, whilst at Gateshead, on some occasion; and adds, <Q>At present there is neither inscription <HI>nor</HI> statue, <HI>nor</HI> do I believe there ever was on Trollop's monument.</Q> Whether Mr Pennant's known veracity will go further than the splenetick froth of a man who dares not subscribe his name to his <HI>belief,</HI> the reader must determine.</P></NOTE> the front towards the

river being ornamented with two series of columns. The expence a∣mounted to 11,200l. 10,000l. of which was advanced by the Corpora∣tion, and 1200l. a donation from Alderman Weimouth, compleated the work. The area in front was ornamented with an equestrian statue, in copper, of King James II. the horse in a vaulting attitude, supported by a pedestal of white marble. This statue was by an outrageous mob pulled down A.D. 1688, and appropriated to furnish bells for the church of All-hallows or All-saints. The statue was said to be of ex∣cellent workmanship, and cost 1700l. An elegant plate was published of it in 1742.</P>
<P>The Trinity House at the Head of the Broad Chair: In it are apart∣ments for 14 persons, to whom 8s. per month with coals and cloath∣ing are given: it also contains a spacious hall and a neat chapel. Dal∣ton's Place stood upon this ground. It is not known when or by whom the monastery of the Trinity was founded. The original insti∣tution of the order of the Holy Trinity was in 1198, in the time of Pope Innocent III. and was for the redemption of captives from slavery. The Trinity House we are now speaking of appertains to the fraternity of Mariners, who have received three several royal charters; one in the 3d year of King James I. the second by King Charles II. 1664, and the third by King James II. 1687.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Randal.</NOTE></P>
<P>The Mansion House, in the Close; the temporary place of residence of the Mayor. It is an elegant modern building, with a spacious area on the banks of Tyne.</P>
<P>The Freemen's Hospital, in the Manors, founded by the Corporation in 1681, for a Master and 39 poor Freemen, or their widows. The
<PB N="403" REF="418"/>
Master's annual allowance 6l. each of the Brethren 4l. The building is handsome, three stories in height, ornamented with a piazza 60 yards in length: an open area with a fountain in front.</P>
<P>Davison's Hospital, for six widows of Clergymen or Merchants. The building was erected at the expence of the Corporation, and the endow∣ment was made by Mrs Ann Davison, the relict of a Merchant of this town. The allowance to each is 40s. quarterly.</P>
<P>The Barber Surgeons Hall.</P>
<P>The Maidens Hospital, built by the Corporation in 1753, and en∣dowed by a donation of 1200l. from Thomas Davison, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> of Ferry-hill, in the county of Durham, and his sisters; and the like sum of 1200l. from the munificent Sir Walter Blackett—for the reception of six maiden women and six poor men.</P>
<P>The Keelmen's Hospital, a square building with cloisters, near Sand∣gate, built in 1701, by a contribution of 1d. each tide from every Keel∣man plying upon the Tyne, within the liberties of Newcastle. It con∣tains upwards of 50 chambers, but is said to be neglected, and without endowment. It is wonderful this laborious and useful race of men, whose toils help to contribute such immense wealth to Newcastle, should not have claimed the attention of the Corporation, from whose revenue more donations issue in charitable and religious appropriations, than any other Corporation in the North of England can boast.</P>
<P>The Infirmary stands in an airy elevated situation behind Westgate, and near the public walk called the Forth: It was founded by subscrip∣tion, for the relief of the sick and lame of Newcastle and the counties of Durham and Northumberland. To this excellent foundation Sir Walter Blackett gave 1000l. out of the interest money arising from which donation, he appointed 10l. a year should be given to a Clergy∣man to do duty there. So happy a relief has this charitable institution proved, that from the time of its commencement to April 1778, 17,331 patients have been discharged cured.</P>
<P>To these may be added the Hospital for Lunatics, and the Hospital for Married Women lying-in: as also the fund raised for the support of those who lie-in at their own houses.</P>
<P><PB N="404" REF="419"/><HI>An elegant Hall</HI> has lately been erected in High Friar Chair, by the society of <HI>Free and Accepted Masons</HI> of the Lodge of St. John: it is richly ornamented, and has an excellent organ for their solemn rites. It was dedicated in the year 1777; to attend which ceremony, there was the most respectable and numerous convention of that order that ever ap∣peared in the northern parts of this kingdom. The music was per∣formed by an excellent band, the vocal parts of which were done by the best voices from the quire of Durham cathedral. A pathetic exhor∣tation was delivered by Mr Huntley, and an elegant oration, display∣ing the antiquity, progress, and excellence of the order, by the Rev. Dr Scott of Simonburn. The festival was held in the new assembly room, when at three tables near 400 of the brethren dined together; at which time that regularity, order and harmony were maintained, for which this society, above all others in the world, is remarkable: where men of all ranks, political opinions, and religious persuasions meet, without envy or contention; and preserve a unanimity and bro∣therly love, in despite of the frailties and fickleness of the human heart.</P>
<P>The history of this place is very dark, antecedent to the time of Ro∣bert Carthouse, and the building of the castle, from whence it is pre∣sumed the name of Newcastle was derived. The advantages of a fine navigable river, with a situation defended by so strong a fortress, would soon induce Merchants and others to fix there; yet we find no record of any royal charter, liberty, or franchise granted to the settlers, till the reign of King Henry II. when they obtained a royal charter, which is said to have comprehended great privileges;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gardiner, ch. 2. p. 7.</NOTE> but of what nature these were, our author is silent. King John, in the 3d year of his reign, confirmed the above charter, on payment of 100 marks and two palfreys.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Madox Firma Burgi, p. 54.</NOTE> In the 14th year of his reign he greatly enlarged those li∣berties and powers, and expressly <Q>in consideration of the loyalty and faithful services of his burgesses there,</Q> he granted them several ex∣clusive privileges; among which are, an exemption from the power of the Sheriff of the county at large, and that they should be amenable to the Courts only within their own jurisdiction, except in matters rela∣tive to the rights of the Crown. The government of the borough was then under four Bailiffs only.</P>
<P><PB N="405" REF="420"/>King Henry III. by charter, appointed a Mayor to preside in the government of this borough, together with four Bailiffs. From this Prince the Burgesses derived two most excellent bounties, viz. the Castle Demesnes, containing 850 acres, for free pasturage, with liberty of win∣ning coal and stone; as also a plot of ground called the Forth, contain∣ing about 11 acres. Here the Infirmary stands: a portion of the ground is inclosed, and converted into a public walk. One thing very singular in this royal charter, is the prohibition against Jews residing within the borough.</P>
<P>This was one of the boroughs that received the first summons to send Representatives to sit in a House of Commons, in the 10th year of the reign of King Edward I. A. D. 1282.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><TABLE>

<PB N="407" REF="422"/>
the custom established within the borough, the real estates of freemen within the borough had always been considered in the nature of chattels, and as such were disposed by will: which special custom was accordingly confirmed.</P>
<P><PB N="408" REF="423"/>King Edward III. confirmed all its franchises and privileges, and added thereto an exemption from the jurisdiction of the Constablery, Marshalsea, and Admiralty of England, within the port and limits of the borough. He gave the Town Moor to the Burgesses in perpetuity;
<PB N="409" REF="424"/>
he also gave licence to the Burgesses to purchase lands; he confirmed many by-laws made by them for well-governing the borough; directed the mode of electing Mayors, Magistrates, and Officers; he settled the measure to be used in the sale of coals, and made the Burgesses toll-free for their merchandize throughout his dominions.</P>
<P><PB N="410" REF="425"/>King Richard II. in the first year of his reign, A. D. 1378, con∣firmed the charters before granted to the Burgesses; he afterwards granted them ground for roads and a bridge.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This was to enlarge and render more commodious the access to the bridge.</NOTE> In 1390, he gave li∣cence for a sword of state to be borne before the Mayor.</P>
<P>It was not till the reign of King Henry IV. that Newcastle received the most distinguishing marks of royal favour: on the accession of this Prince, the borough received a confirmation of all ancient liberties and immunities; besides which he also granted, that this borough should for ever thereafter be independent of the county of Northumberland; that it should have a Sheriff, as being a county of itself, a district not above 10 miles in circuit; which Sheriff should supply the duty of the Bailiffs, whose office was from thenceforth revoked and annulled; that the Sheriff should hold his county within the liberties of the borough, on Wednesday from month to month, that he should have the return of writs, and account unto his Majesty's Exchequer;<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P>A correct table of the Mayors and Sheriffs is given in Bourne's work: I will only add the succession since the time of that publication.</P>

King Edward II. granted the Conservatorship of the river Tyne to John Earl of Hampstead; but the same was soon revoked, on its being represented an infringement on the rights of Newcastle.</P>
<P><PB N="412" REF="427"/>King Edward VI. on the dissolution of the Bishopric of Durham by act of parliament, A. D. 1552, granted to Newcastle the town and li∣berties of Gateshead: he also proposed to have erected a Bishopric at Newcastle, out of part of the revenues of the dissolved See;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The preamble of the act sets forth "That this Bishoprick being then void of a Prelate, the gift thereof was in the King's pleasure, and the compass of it being so large as to extend itself into several shires far distant, it could not be sufficiently served by one Bishop; and since the King by his godly disposition was desirous to have God's holy word preached in those parts, which were wild and barbarous for lack of good preaching and good searching; there∣for he intendeth to have two good Bishopricks for that diocese; the one at Durham, which should have 2000 marks yearly revenue, and another at Newcastle with 1000; and also found a cathedral church at the latter place, with a Deanery and Chapter, out of the revenues of the said Bishoprick; therefore the Bishoprick of Durham is utterly extinguished and dissolved, and authority given for letters patents to erect the two new Bishopricks, together with a Deanery and Chapter at Newcastle, with a proviso that the rights of the Deanery, Chapter, and Cathe∣dral of Durham should suffer nothing by this act."</NOTE> but these purposes were defeated by the death of the King; and on the accession of Queen Mary, 1554, the Bishopric of Durham was restored.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The preamble sets forth, "That certain ambitious persons taking advantage of the late King's minority, made an interest, by sinister practice, to procure the dissolution of the Bishoprick; that it was done out of mercenary views, to enrich themselves and their friends, by seizing the lands of the See, rather than upon just occasion or godly zeal; that Tunstall Bishop of Durham was deprived upon unjust furmises and false accusations, and that the process against him was foul and illegal; that upon a full examination of the matter by the Queen's commissioners, the sentence of deprivation was declared void, as may be seen at large by an authentic instrument; that the Queen had new founded the Bishoprick by her letters patents, and restored all the lands in her possession. But that neither the sentence of deprivation, nor the Queen's letters patents were of sufficient force to recover the honours, lands, &amp;c. to the See of Durham; therefore to restore the Bishoprick to its former interest, privileges, and revenues, the two dissolution statutes of the last reign are hereby repealed."</NOTE></P>
<P>Queen Elizabeth confirmed to the Burgesses all the liberties and im∣munities granted by her predecessors, and added thereto many privileges by her charter dated, as Mr Wallis says, on the 22d March, in the 42d year of her reign; but as it appears by a note to Bourne's History, in the 31st year of that reign. It was then declared to be a free town, with power to the corporate body to purchase lands to them and their successors in fee and perpetuity, and to grant and demise the same; and that they should have a common seal: that they should exercise an Admiralty Jurisdiction within their own liberties, exclusive of any au∣thority of the Lord High Admiral.</P>

<P>The chief article of export is coal:<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Great disputes have arose touching the time when coals were first used in this island.</P>
<P>Our Antiquaries have conjectured that the Romans knew how to win them and their use; yet in the discovery of their hippocausts, and of the vaults where the remains of sacrifice have been found, it is not asserted by any that the remains of any coal fires have been discovered.</P>

<P>In the 1st year of the reign of King Edward I. mention is made <HI>de Carbonibus Maritimis,</HI> and their measure.</P>
<P>In the 31st year of that reign, a complaint was made of the public nuisance the burning of coal was in the city and suburbs of London, by corrupting the air by the stink and smoke, and a proclamation was issued to prohibit its use; and afterwards a Commission of Oyer to punish those who used it, in defiance of the proclamation.</P>

<P>By a charter of 23 King Henry III. A. D. 1239, licence was given to win coal in the Castle Field and Forth.</P>
<P>In the 9th of King Henry V. 1421, a duty of two-pence a chaldron being paid to the King, the burthen of keels was limited by statute to 20 chaldron, and the keels were directed to be sealed by the King's officers, to prevent frauds in the duty. St. 9 K. Hen. 5. cha. 10.</P>
<P>In a charter of the 8th of King Henry IV. <HI>De privilegijs &amp; Libert. Epi Dun.</HI> A charter of the 7th of King Richard III. is recited <HI>De Carbonib. &amp; aliis Merchandizis vendendis.</HI></P>
<P>Queen Elizabeth granted a charter to the Fraternity called Free Hostmen for the vending of Coals, reserving a duty of 12d a chaldron.</P>
<P>By the stat. 30. King Charles II. Commissioners are appointed for regulating the duties on coals, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The quantity of a Ten of coals is uncertain, and not always the same, but commonly 16 Newcastle chaldrons make a ten. Two keels also make a ten, and 11 waggons a keel. Each waggon contains 19 bolls and upwards, at 36 gallons to a boll, and 9 bolls or thereabouts go to a fother, and three fothers and a quarter make a chaldron; 21 corves to a score, and 55 fother make a ten.</P>
<P>A square yard of solid coal contains eight bolls.</P>
<P>An acre of ground contains 4840 square yards of solid coal, which is near equal to 68 tens, at 16 chaldrons to a ten, which is near equal to 1088 chaldrons of coals.</P>
<P>Three square yards and a quarter go to a chalder.</P>
<P>Waggon ways were first used in this neighbourhood soon after the revolution, by Mr Allan of Flatts, in the county of Durham, and on the Tyne by Charles Montague, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> at Stella.</P></NOTE> ships of great burthen take in their lading at Shields, the coals being carried thither in large un∣wieldy lighters, called keels, limited by government to the burthen of 20 chaldrons, being nearly circular in form, and very flat bottomed; sometimes navigated by a square sail, at other times managed with the advantage of the tide, by one oar plied at the side and another at the stern, which serves as a sculler and rudder. Near 500 of these

vessels find constant employ on this river. No vessels exceeding 400 tons come up to the Quay.</P>
<P>The collieries which supply this exportation, about 24 in number, lie at considerable distances from the river. From the mines, the coals are sent to the places of lading in large unwieldy carriages or waggons, of the form of a common mill-hopper, carried on four wheels of iron, the fellies or rims of which are hollow, so as to run upon strings of wood adapted thereto, with which the roads are laid. By this means, these carriages on an easy descent run without horses, and sometimes with that rapidity, that a piece of wood, called a tiller, is obliged to be applied to one wheel, and pressed thereon by the weight of the at∣tendant who sits on it, to retard the motion: by the friction of which frequently the tiller and sometimes the carriage is set on fire.</P>
<P>In the course of the year 1775, 697, 608 chaldrons of coals were im∣ported in the port of London from Newcastle, and Sunderland on the the river Wear, in the county of Durham; which is 37,237 chaldrons more than the year 1773, and 77,237 chaldrons more than in the year 1774. In the year 1776, 600,000 chaldrons were imported at London.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A manuscript note in the margin of Bourne's History of Newcastle, in Fisher's Circulating Library, p. 159.</NOTE></P>
<P>In 1775, 4773 ships were cleared at the Custom-house of Newcastle; of which 4343 were coastways, and 430 for foreign parts; being upon the whole 270 less than in the year 1774.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P>The great export of this place is coal, for which it has been noted for some centuries. It is not exactly known at what time that species of fuel was first dug. It is probable that it was not very early in general use. That the Romans sometimes made use of it appears in our for∣mer volume, p. 55: but since wood was the fuel of their own country, and Britain was over∣run with forests, it was not likely that they would pierce into the bowels of the earth for a less grateful kind. But it was exported to foreign parts long before it was in use in London; for London likewise had its neighbouring forests. We find that in 1234, King Henry III. confirms to the good people of Newcastle, the charter of his father King John, granting them the pri∣vilege of digging coals in the Castle Moor, and converting them to their own profit, in aid of their fee-farm rent of one hundred a year; which moor was afterwards granted to them in property by Edward III. The time of the first exportation of coals to London does not appear. In 1307, the 35th year of Edward I. they were considered in the capital as a nuisance; for on the repeated complaints of Prelates, Nobles, Commons of Parliament, and Inhabitants of Lon∣don, against the stench and smoke of coals used by Brewers, Dyers, and other Artificers, the King issued out his proclamation against the use of them: which being disregarded, a com∣mission of Oyer and Terminer was issued, to punish the disobedient with fines for the first of∣fence, and for the second, by the destruction of their furnaces. In 1379, we find that their use was not only tolerated, but their consumption made beneficial to the state; for in that year a duty of six-pence per ten each quarter of a year was imposed on ships coming from Newcastle. In 1421, the trade became so important as to engage the regulations of government, and or∣ders were given about the lengths of the keels, so that the quantity of coal might be ascer∣tained. From that period the commerce advanced continually.

<P>In the year 1244, King Henry III. assembled a great army and marched to Newcastle, whilst the King of Scotland marched to Ponte∣land. There were 5000 horse among the English troops finely armed. In the Scotch army were 1000 horse with armour of iron or network, to which were added 100,000 foot; but no engagement ensued, as Alex∣ander, who before had denied King Henry's supremacy, now submitted to acknowledge Henry as his liege Lord, and agreed to bind himself not to enter into any league with any of the enemies of the King of England.</P>

<P>In the year 1292, after the Regency of Scotland was dissolved, Baliol swore fealty to King Edward I. in the castle of Norham, in the pre∣sence of many of the Nobility of both nations. The next day the royal commission was issued, directing John St. John to place Baliol in the royal chair at Scone, according to the ancient mode of inauguration of the Kings of Scotland: in which duty St. John represented Duncan Earl of Fife, then a minor, whose hereditary office it was gained by his ancestors for their distinguished services. This ceremony was soon after performed on St. Andrew's day; after which Baliol passing into England, did homage to King Edward on Christmas day at Newcastle, in the hall of the castle.</P>
<P>In the year 1296, an open rupture taking place between the two kingdoms, the Scots professing to throw off the English yoke, King Edward appointed the 1st day of March for his rendezvous at New∣castle,

<P>In 1327, Nov. 20th, the Commissioners of both nations met at New∣castle, and concluding a truce, such preliminaries for a settled peace were agreed upon, as were deemed worthy a parliamentary considera∣tion; and accordingly a parliament was summoned to assemble at York at Candlemas following, in which was given the memorable recognition of the right of Robert Bruce and his heirs to the Crown of Scotland, and the renunciation of all claim and right to the dominion or sove∣reignty of the kingdom by King Edward III. and his successors Kings of England, and that the said kingdom should be held for ever divided and distinct from the kingdom of England, and in all respects inde∣pent of it; and to that end, all writings and evidences to the contrary should be deemed null and void: and on the part of King Robert Bruce, 20,000l. was stipulated to be paid by Scotland, in three yearly pay∣ments, to King Edward's officers at Tweedmouth.</P>

<P>King Edward III. having placed Edward Baliol on the throne of Scotland, kept his Whitsuntide, A. D. 1334, at Newcastle, with great splendour and magnificence. In the month of June, in quality of So∣vereign Lord of Scotland, he received there, in a public and solemn manner, the fealty and homage of the Scotch King: at the same time Baliol ceded to him large Scotch territories, in satisfaction of the ex∣pences sustained in restoring the Crown to him, as its hereditary claim∣ant. By the following passage in Lel. Col. vol. I. p. 469, it appears that greater cessions were made by Baliol: <Q>And this Edwarde Baillol condescendid with Eduarde King of England, after that he had done the accustomid services, that if he died without heyres, the realme of Scotlande should remayne to King Edwarde of England and his heyres for ever. And this pact was made at Newcastle upon Tyne.</Q></P>
<P>Through the interposition of the King of France, Edward consented to a truce with David Bruce's party, who had opposed Edward Baliol; on the expiration of which, about Midsummer 1335, both Kings held their rendezvous at Newcastle with a powerful army, preparatory to their entry into Scotland.</P>
<P>In the year 1336, King Edward met the Scotch Delegates at New∣castle, when he acceded to proposals made by the Pope's Nuncio, for a further time of truce.</P>

<P>In 1342, David King of Scots having committed horrid ravages on his march through Northumberland, came before Newcastle with a powerful army, amounting in numbers, as some authors insist, to 60,000 foot and 3000 horse.

and much booty, not having lost one man. The Scotch enraged at the disgrace, began a fierce but irregular attack, and were repulsed with great slaughter. The bravery of the garrison induced David to raise the siege and march towards Durham, which city he took by storm, and with the most savage barbarity put the inhabitants to the sword, without distinction of age, sex, or condition.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Barns's Hist.

and many proper feats of arms done. Amongst others there fought hand to hand the Earl Douglas and Sir Henry Percy; and by force of arms the Earl won Sir Henry's penon. Whereupon Sir Henry and all the English were sore displeased; the Earl saying to him, Sir, I shall bear this token of your prowess into Scotland, and shall set it on high on my castle of Alquest, that it may be seen afar off: which so provoked the Percys, that after divers bold adventures against the Scotch forces, at length they obtained the victory, and slew the Earl James Douglas; but Sir Ralph Percy was therein wounded and taken prisoner by a Scotch Knight.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Scotti posuerunt castra prope Novum Castellum.

<P>In the time of King Charles I. A. D. 1643, Newcastle sustained a siege, the Scotch advancing against it under the command of Lesley, who dividing the forces, attacked it vigorously on two sides at once. The Marquis of Newcastle, then Governor for the King, maintained the place, though the enemy gained part of the outworks; and some un∣fortunate sallies were made. In the succeeding year the Scots took it by storm. Sir John Merlay then Mayor retired to the castle with about 500 men, which he held till terms of capitulation were obtained. The inhabitants saved the town from being plundered by payment of a large sum of money. The Parliament disfranchised the body corporate, and ordered the Mayor to be tried by a court martial. Sir Henry An∣derson,

<P>The ancient bridge was of wood and in the 33d year of the reign of King Henry III. was destroyed by fire. The late bridge was con∣structed of stone, and consisted of 12 arches; three of which on the north were closed up and used as cellars. It was built about 500 years ago, Walter Kirkham,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He came to the See 1249.</NOTE> Bishop of Durham, being a great contributor thereto.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P>The original superstructure of this bridge was probably of wood, like that over the Danube, and continued made with the same material for several centuries. Notice is taken of it in the reign of King Richard I. when Philip Poictiers, Bishop of Durham, gave licence to the Bur∣gesses of Gateshead to give wood to whomsoever they pleased to be spent about the river Tyne; which is supposed to mean in the repairs of the bridge and quay on the part belonging to Dur∣ham; for one third belongs to the Bishop, and two to the town; so that after it was destroyed in 1248 by a furious fire, the Bishop and the town united in the expence of building the stone bridge, of which this calamity was the origin. The Prelate (Walter Kirkham) had the ad∣vantage in this; for, armed with spiritual powers, he issued out indulgences from all penances to every one that would assist, either with money or labour. The town also applied to other Bishops for their assistance in promoting so good a work, and they in consequence granted their indulgences; but then the Clergy of the North were directed by their Archdeacon, to prefer the indulgences; of their own Prelate to any other. In the end both parties succeeded, and the money raised was given to Laurentius, Master of the Bridge.

This tower was of considerable service some years ago, in preventing the further communication of a fire which consumed many houses ad∣joining it. At the south end was formerly another tower and a draw-bridge. A blue stone near the middle of the bridge denoted the boun∣dary of the town's liberty, the southern end of the bridge appertaining to the See of Durham. In the year 1416, a claim of the Corporation to the whole bridge occasioned a suit, in which the right of the Bishop of Durham to the southern part was established. Thomas Ruthal, Bishop of Durham in the reign of King Henry VII. repaired the southern part.<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><P>This part of the bridge was repaired by Thomas Ruthal, Bishop of Durham, famous in the reigns of King Henry VII. and VIII. not only for being the richest subject then in Britain, but for the unfortunate mistake he made in delivering the book of his own private affairs to the aspiring Cardinal Wolsey, instead of one he had wrote on the state of the kingdom by the desire of his Sovereign, whereby the Cardinal effected his ruin and stepped into his Bishoprick.

with this motto, <HI>Adventus Regis, Solamen Gregis.</HI> There was an open∣ing in the battlements of the bridge railed with iron, for the conveni∣ence of passengers to look upon the river and shipping: Mr Bourne re∣lates a story, that from thence one <HI>Anderson,</HI> an Alderman, dropt his signet ring into the river; that some time afterwards his own servant having bought a salmon for his table, in opening the fish the ring was found in its intrails, and was in his days in the custody of a descendant of Mr Anderson. <HI>Herodotus</HI> gives an account of a similar circumstance happening to <HI>Polycrates</HI> King of <HI>Samos,</HI> who was called <HI>the favourite of Fortune.</HI></P>
<P>On the 20th of June 1770, the workmen began to pull down the west end of St. Thomas's chapel, in order to open the passage to the bridge.</P>
<P>In the inundation 11th Nov. 1771, the water was supposed to be at its height about seven in the morning, and to have risen upwards of 12 feet above high water mark in spring tides. From Tyne Head, in Aldston Moor, to Shields, was a continued scene of horror and devas∣tation.</P>
<P>An act of parliament passed 3d June 1772, to enable the Bishop of Durham and his successors to raise a competent sum of money, to be applied for the repairing, improving, or rebuilding such part of Tyne Bridge as belongs to the See of Durham.</P>
<P>On the 10th June 1772, one Stephenson contracted to build a tem∣porary bridge over the Tyne in four months time, under a great pe∣nalty; which was performed.</P>
<P>On Tuesday 25th April 1775, the first stone of the south pier of the new bridge, within the boundaries of this Corporation, was laid by Sir Matthew White Ridley, Mayor.</P>
<P>From the evidence of the ancient name of Pons Aelii and the Roman road from Chester leading thereto, it is conjectured that the Romans had a bridge here.</P>
<P>Mr Pennant is of opinion, <Q>that part of the Roman bridge remained till the late inundation; for from the observation of workmen upon the old piers, those as well as the piers of the bridge at Bywell, seem originally to have been formed without any springs for arches. This
<PB N="430" REF="445"/>
was a manner of building used by the Romans, witness the bridge built over the Danube by Trajan at Severin, whose piers (he believes) still exist. Adrian was probably the founder of the bridge at New∣castle, which was called after his family name Pons Aelii, in the same manner as Jerusalem was styled Elia Capitolina, and the games he instituted at Pincum in Maesia, Aeliana Pincensia. The coins disco∣vered on pulling down some of the piers in 1774, confirm my opinion. Several were discovered, but only three or four rescued from the hands of the workmen. All of them are coins posterior to the time of Adrian, probably deposited there in some later repairs. One of them is a beautiful Faustina the Elder after her deification. Her fore∣head is bound with a small tiara; her hair full, twisted and dressed <HI>a la moderne;</HI> round is inscribed Diva Faustina. On the reverse is <HI>Ceres,</HI> with a torch in one hand and ears of corn in the other. The inscription <HI>Augusta S. C.</HI></Q></P>

<P>There was a well at Jesmond, greatly resorted to by persons labour∣ing under infirmities, for its salutary qualities. It had as many steps down to it as there are articles in the Creed. Many pilgrimages were made to Jesmond, to visit the shrine of the Virgin, and to partake of the miraculous virtues of the sanctified spring.

<P><PB N="433" REF="448"/>Benwell was the <HI>Condercum</HI> of the Romans:<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>In Mr Horsley's works the following Roman Antiquities found at this station are mentioned:</P>
<P>No. VII. <HI>Jovi Optimo Maximo Dolicheno, et Numinibus Augusti prosalute Imperatoris Caesaris Titi Aelii Hadriani Augusti Pii patris patriae et legionis secundae Augustae Marcus Liburnius Fronto Centurio Legionis ejusdem votum solvit libens merito.</HI></P>
<P>Between <HI>Cousins</HI> House and <HI>Benwell</HI> I could not meet with any Roman inscriptions or sculp∣tures. I never heard of any found at <HI>Newcastle;</HI> nor is this much to be wondered at, con∣sidering how large a town it has long been, and how easy it is to suppose that all that was Roman has been lost some ages ago amongst such numerous buildings: I therefore proceed to the inscriptions at <HI>Benwell.</HI> There are three belonging to this fort, of which this and the next have been published only (I think) by Mr Gordon: That part of the two first lines, which is lost in the break of the stone, is so supplied by Mr Gordon, as if the whole had been <HI>Jovi Optimo Maximo et numinibus, &amp;c.</HI> and as if the words <HI>Optimo Maximo</HI> had been wrote at large so as to fill up the whole vacancy: but these words are seldom found at length upon an altar, and will by no means consist with the letters <HI>HENO,</HI> which are very plain and distinct. The reading I have given seems to answer as to the letters, and to fill up the space with the greatest exactness; and it will be hard to find another word into which the letters <HI>HENO</HI> will enter, nor is there any occasion to search for any other, since <HI>Jupiter Dolichenus</HI> had not only several altars dedicated to him in other places, but one or two likewise in <HI>Britain. Caesar,</HI> in the short Natural History he gives of <HI>Britain,</HI> tells us, <HI>"The inland countries afford tin, and the mari∣time iron, tho' no great plenty of it."</HI> This passage of <HI>Caesar</HI> may give us some light into the reason of these altars being dedicated to <HI>Jupiter Dolichenus,</HI> when compared with another inscription to the same deity, published by <HI>Reinesius,</HI> and referred to in <HI>Camden:</HI> The inscription is this, <HI>Jovi Op∣timo Maximo Dolycheno ubi Ferrum nacitur, Sempronius Rectus Cent. Frumentarius, D. D.</HI> Reine∣sius thinks <HI>Jupiter</HI> had this name given him from <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, a town of <HI>Epirus</HI> or <HI>Macedonia,</HI> which country <HI>Strabo</HI> represents as rugged and mountainous, and productive of metals, among which <HI>Reinesius</HI> supposes there was <HI>iron.</HI> If this was the case, though <HI>Strabo</HI> I think does not men∣tion <HI>iron,</HI> the words <HI>ubi serrum nascitur</HI> may seem to intimate that <HI>Jupiter Dolichenus</HI> had some particular concern in <HI>iron mines,</HI> and so might well be applied to for assistance and con∣duct by those who entertained hopes of making beneficial discoveries in that way; now <HI>Ben∣well</HI> is not many miles from the sea, and this country abounds with mines of coal that bring yearly a very large sum of money into it; and the Romans, from Caesar's account and other circumstances, might expect to find <HI>iron mines</HI> in these parts, and upon that occasion pay their devotion to <HI>Jupiter Dolichenus. Montsaucon</HI> has given us one image of this deity, found at <HI>Marseilles,</HI> clad in armour, and standing upon a <HI>bull,</HI> which seems to agree very well with this account; but another image represents him in a rustic habit, with an <HI>ox</HI> under him; and <HI>Stephanus,</HI> who calls him <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, derives his name from <HI>Dolochene,</HI> a city of <HI>Camma∣gene,</HI> in <HI>Asia,</HI> which <HI>Strabo</HI> describes as a fruitful country, well planted with <HI>trees</HI> and <HI>vines;</HI>
<PB N="434" REF="449"/>it is not unlikely therefore he might be worshipped at both these places, and that the words in <HI>Reinesius's</HI> inscription <HI>ubi Ferrum nascitur</HI> might be designed as descriptive of the <HI>Graecian Deity:</HI> it may not be improper to remark, that there is a coalry not far from <HI>Benwell,</HI> a part of which is judged by those that are best skilled in such affairs to have been wrought by the Ro∣mans. The <HI>Legio Secunda Augusta,</HI> for whose preservation, together with that of the Emperor, this altar was erected, must at this time have been upon the wall in Northumberland, which very probably (if <HI>Pausanius's</HI> account be true) might be after they had defeated the <HI>Brigantes,</HI> and taken from them a great part of their land.</P>
<P>The words which I read <HI>Centurio Legionis ejusdem,</HI> are by Mr Gordon read <HI>legatus ejusdem,</HI> which mistake he seems to have been led into by not observing the <HI>centurial mark;</HI> so that here is no foundation to suppose a new <HI>Propraetor</HI> or <HI>Lieutenant, M. Liburnius Fronte,</HI> from this in∣scription: this curious altar has on one side <HI>the sacrificing knife and ax,</HI> on the other side both the <HI>Patera</HI> and <HI>Praeferi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ulum.</HI> This and the following were in the collection of <HI>Robert Shaft<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR></HI></P>
<P>No. VIII. <HI>Centurio Legionis vicestmae valentis victricis, votum solvil libens merito.</HI></P>
<P>This is an imperfect inscription, upon the lower part of a broken altar, found in the same place with the preceding; and as that was erected by a centurion of the second Legion called <HI>Augusta,</HI> so this by another such officer of the <HI>twentieth Legion</HI> called <HI>Valens Victri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>:</HI> the mark for the <HI>Centurion</HI> is very plain and distinct upon the stone, though omitted by <HI>Mr Gordon;</HI> nor do I remember an instance in Britain of an altar erected by a <HI>whole Legion,</HI> though it was fre∣quently done by a <HI>Cohort.</HI> My reason for reading <HI>Valens Victrix</HI> and not <HI>Valeria or Valeriana</HI> I have given before.</P>

<P>I first discovered this inscription on the side wall of a house at <HI>East Denton,</HI> which village stands upon the wall, about a quarter of a mile west from <HI>Benw<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll Fort.</HI> The house was after∣wards demolished, and this stone thrown among the dirt and rubbish: but being again reco∣vered, by a curious gentleman of my acquaintance, is now in my possession. Tho' the word <HI>secit,</HI> as synonimous with <HI>p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sant,</HI> is frequently applied to an altar or monument, and therefore does not certainly prove that the legion was at this time employed in building the wall, or the <HI>val∣la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>;</HI> yet as no person is named in the inscription, to whose honour this monement was erected, the word <HI>fecit</HI> may possibly refer to some other work than purely setting up such a stone, and to none more likely than building that part of the wall; but this I have considered in its pro∣per place. It is somewhat rare and curious, to have the name of the <HI>legion</HI> and the number of the <HI>cohort</HI> set down both together, so distinctly as here. There are some other parallel in∣stances of legionary cohorts in Britain, but not very many.

<PB N="435" REF="450"/>this <HI>Ala</HI> was in garrison. I was agreeably surprized at the sight of it, because it is a fur∣ther confirmation of the scheme I had advanced concerning these stations: I was also pleased to discover the small <HI>o</HI> at the end of the last line, which is sufficiently distinct and certain, and proves the word to be <HI>Astorum</HI> not <HI>Asturum,</HI> in which it agrees with the <HI>Notitia.</HI> That part of the stone which is near the <HI>M</HI> in the bordering is imperfect and broken. I make no doubt but the letters <HI>RV</HI> have been before the <HI>M,</HI> and that it is to be read <HI>Astorum:</HI> the <HI>PRA</HI> on the other side can be nothing else but <HI>Praefectus:</HI> there is no appearance left of any cross strokes of the <HI>E</HI> after <HI>Ala</HI> in the last line; but as these may have been worn out, I am of opinion that it was at first <HI>ALAE,</HI> and that the monument was set up by <HI>Felix</HI> the commander of this <HI>Ala:</HI> it seems plainly to have been erected <HI>Victoriae Augustorum,</HI> for the word <HI>Victoriae</HI> is compleat and distinct; the upper parts of the two <HI>G G</HI> are yet visible; and <HI>Dr Woodward</HI> had put a <HI>V</HI> before them in his copy, though I could not discern any vestige of it on the stone: I suppose a stroke or two in the next letters are now effaced, and that they were originally a double <HI>N</HI> conjoined for <HI>nostrorum;</HI> and whosoever considers the frequent va∣riation of letters we often meet with in the same monument, won't think it strange that the first stroke is more oblique here than in one or two instances of the same letter afterwards the letters <HI>F E</HI> at the end of this line must in all probability stand for the word <HI>Fecit.</HI> If my reading be allowed, the monument must have been erected by <HI>Felix,</HI> who was the grandson of <HI>Socius Se∣necio</HI> the consul, and the commander of the first wing of the <HI>Asti. Mr Ward</HI> chuses to read the third and fourth lines thus: <HI>Numerius Sosius Senecio Nepos Consulis Felix.</HI> The letter <HI>N</HI> put for a <HI>praenomen</HI> signifies <HI>Numerius,</HI> according to <HI>Diomedes. Sosius</HI> was one of the consuls names, who is called <HI>G. Sosius Senecio</HI> in the <HI>Fasti Consulares,</HI> and <HI>N</HI> for <HI>Nepos</HI> is very common upon inscriptions: as to the situation of the words <HI>Nepos Consulis,</HI> 'tis usual in inscriptions to insert such words as express any relation or other circumstance of those who erect them, before the last name: but <HI>N S</HI> in <HI>Goltzins</HI> is made to stand for <HI>Numerius,</HI> as well as <HI>N</HI> alone. This being admitted, we may read <HI>Numerius Senecio Nepos Consulis Felix:</HI> but I much incline to the reading that I have given, which occurred to me at the first: 'tis evident that no regard is had in this inscription to the usual order of the words in others; there seems rather to be an af∣fected singularity as to this matter. <HI>Senecio,</HI> who is mentioned in an inscription or two found at <HI>Brugh</HI> in <HI>Richmondshire,</HI> (the originals of which are now lost was probably of the same family, though rather too late to be the same person with him who is described in this monu∣ment, for he (as appears from these inscriptions I have referred to) lived under the reign of <HI>Commodus,</HI> and continued at least till the joint reign of <HI>Severus</HI> and <HI>Caracalla,</HI> is later than a grandson of <HI>Sosius Senecio</HI> the consul can well be supposed to have lived; for <HI>Sosius Senecio</HI> was the fourth and last time consul in conjunction with <HI>Licinius Sura</HI> in the year 107, under the reign of <HI>Trojan,</HI> from whence to the beginning of the joint reign of <HI>Severus</HI> and <HI>Caracalla</HI> is little less than a <HI>century;</HI> for the same reason it is not so probable that the two Emperors here intended are <HI>Severus</HI> and <HI>Caracalla,</HI> but rather <HI>Marcus Aurelius and Lucius Verus,</HI> who, as well as the others, carried on a war with success against the <HI>Britons,</HI> and <HI>Calpurnius Agricola</HI> was their <HI>Legate,</HI> whose name we meet with in some inscriptions found near the Roman wall, and as he began to reign jointly above thirty years before the other two, that time suits better than the other: so that upon the whole I take this monument to have been erected to the honour of the Emperors <HI>Marcus Aurelius and Lucius Verus,</HI> upon occasion of some victory they had gained over the northern <HI>Britons</HI> by <HI>Calpurnius Agricola</HI> their <HI>Legate,</HI> in which this <HI>Felix Senecio</HI> had the command of the first wing of the <HI>Asti.</HI> The <HI>Asti,</HI> according to <HI>Pancirollus,</HI> were the inhabitants of the <HI>Asta,</HI> a colony in <HI>Ligu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ia. Asta</HI> is mentioned by <HI>Pliny</HI> and others; no doubt they were distinct from the <HI>Astures,</HI> a people of <HI>Spain.</HI> The four inscriptions which follow are on stones built up in the walls of houses in the village of <HI>Benwell.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="436" REF="451"/>No. IX. <HI>Dis Manibus Aurelii clae primae Astorum.</HI></P>
<P>This is a funeral monument, but imperfect, and has been much abused. I have given the best reading of it I could: it is now built up in the front of <HI>Mrs Lion's house</HI> near the door. There appears something like a stop after the <HI>A</HI> in the last line; but yet I incline to read it <HI>alae primae,</HI> and most probably <HI>Astorum,</HI> for this was the only <HI>ala primae</HI> stationed on the principal line of the wall. This seems to be of <HI>the lower Empire,</HI> and more strongly proves this fort to be the ancient <HI>Condercum.</HI></P>
<P>No. IX. <HI>Centuria Peregtini.</HI> This of <HI>Peregrinus</HI> is now built up in the fore wall of the house of William Gill.</P>
<P>No. IX. <HI>Legionus secundae Augustae cohors decima.</HI></P>
<P>This is very useful and curious, though it contains only the name of the <HI>Legio secunda Augusta,</HI> and the number of the <HI>Cohort,</HI> namely, the <HI>tenth,</HI> for this farther confirms what I had from other reasons and inscriptions conjectured before, that this Legion was employed on the east end of the wall, and this Cohort of that Legion in particular: the <HI>Sea Goat</HI> and <HI>Pegasus</HI> at the top are not uncommon, and seem to denote the maritime situation of the country on the one hand, and the swiftness of the Roman victory on the other. There is a branch in the upper part of the stone which was mistaken by a very learned Antiquary for a Roman <HI>Vexillum,</HI> and we have a Roman <HI>Vexillum</HI> supported by a <HI>Pegasus</HI> and a <HI>Sea Goat</HI> at <HI>Little Chesters</HI> on the wall. This stone is now in the fore wall of the house of <HI>Joseph Wallis,</HI> near the door.</P>
<P>No. IX. <HI>Centuria Arrii.</HI></P>
<P>This of <HI>Arrius</HI> is in the back wall of the house of <HI>Matthew Garret;</HI> both the stone and let∣ters are very coarse. <HI>Arrius</HI> is a Roman name. <HI>Horace</HI> has it once and again.</P>
<P>No. IX. <HI>Centuria Herenniani.</HI></P>
<P>This stone was found near the highway side by <HI>Denton,</HI> and is now in my own possession. <HI>Herennius Herennianus</HI> occurs in a remarkable inscription found in <HI>Spain,</HI> and published in the Transactions. The name on this stone is plainly <HI>Herrennianus.</HI></P>
<P>This station on <HI>Benwell Hill</HI> has furnished a good many inscriptions; but I remember not to have seen or heard of any <HI>Roman coins</HI> found here, nor can I say in the general that Roman coins are so frequent in the stations on the wall as in some other places; but <HI>the fine urn</HI> which they now preserve in <HI>the Library at Durham</HI> was found at this place. The cut of the letters in the inscriptions belonging to <HI>Benwell</HI> is tolerably good, and the inscriptions themselves are not so much perplexed with ligatures of letters, as those of later dates often are, though these are not wholly free from them. But the most curious inscriptions have been removed out of this county: many were carried off by <HI>Sir Robert Cotton,</HI> several of which are yet remaining at <HI>Connington</HI> near <HI>Stilton</HI> in <HI>Hantingdonshire;</HI> but they also are going to ruin, for the summer-house where they were carefully placed by <HI>Sir Robert</HI> being now uncovered, and in a ruinous state, the stones and inscriptions have already suffered very much.</P>
<P><HI>Mr Warburton</HI> had made the largest collection, who was at a great deal of pains and expence to collect the most curious Roman stones he could find in this county, but he unhappily broke many of them in order to make them more portable, and so carried off only that part of the stone which had the inscription; by this means it has happened that many of the stones col∣lected by him are only faces of altars, and in several instances the inscriptions themselves have suffered damage by this unhappy frugality. What this gentleman had collected together at <HI>Hexham</HI> have since been removed to <HI>the Library at Durham.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Mr Warburton</HI> in his <HI>Vallum Romanum</HI> justifies himself against this charge in the following manner: <Q>The editor, in vindication of himself from this unjust accusation of a parsimonious incuriosity, denies the charge in every part; and as a proof of the truth thereof refers himself 
<PB N="437" REF="452"/>to the draughts of the altars he discovered, as the same are represented in the plates. That the Romans frequently broke and defaced altars on particular occasions is evident, and is usually observed to have been practised on Revolutions in the Empire, or upon a persons falling into disgrace, who is mentioned in the inscription.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Observations</HI> on the inscriptions near <HI>Walbottle.</HI></P>
<P>The three following are at a place upon the wall called <HI>Walbottle.</HI></P>
<P>No. X. <HI>Centuria Mucieni Posuit.</HI></P>
<P>This is Centurial, and is now in the sore wall of a cow-house in this village: it contains nothing distinct but the character and name of the <HI>Centurion.</HI></P>
<P>No. XI. <HI>Cohors octava Posuit:</HI> This contains only the number of the <HI>Cohort;</HI> I believe there never has been any thing more inscribed on it, and am apt to think it was the <HI>eighth Cohort</HI> of the <HI>Legio secunda Augusta,</HI> the same as that before in the inscription at <HI>East Denton.</HI></P>
<P>No. XII. The inscriptions contained under this number are only some obscure and doubtful remains of numeral letters. The two first, viz. V and IX have most probably been 8 and 9, denoting the numbers of the <HI>Cohorts;</HI> they are in the corner of the stone wall, through which a small brook passes, a little west from the town; and of the same sort with these are the rest, but placed in several parts of the inside of the wall which incloses the field. There were two or three more of the same sort and size, with No. I upon them, and another also with No. V, besides those which I have described.</P>
<PB N="433" REF="448"/></NOTE> the distinct remains of the station appear on <HI>Benwell Hill.</HI> The observations made thereon and the course of the wall from <HI>Newcastle</HI> to <HI>Rutchester,</HI> by Mr Horsley
<PB N="434" REF="449"/>
and Mr Warburton, are to the following effect. No appearance of either of the Roman walls can be expected as far as the buildings of <HI>Newcastle</HI> extend; but as soon as they are well ended, some feint ves∣tiges
<PB N="435" REF="450"/>
of both, or of what has belonged to them, begin to shew them∣selves: for just at the end of <HI>Westgate,</HI> on the south side of the highway, Hadrian's Ditch seems pretty visible; and near the <HI>Quarry House</HI> some
<PB N="436" REF="451"/>
feint marks of the Ditch and north Agger begin to appear, but chiefly of the latter; and this state of the Vallum extends to <HI>Benwell Fort.</HI> As to Severus's Wall, little or nothing relating to it can be discovered be∣tween
<PB N="437" REF="452"/>
the town and the Quarry House: some visible remains of a cas∣tellum are discoverable just behind the Quarry House, and the line of the wall appeared to go through the midst of the house. The castellum is conveniently placed for prospect, and is the only one that is visible between <HI>Newcastle</HI> and the next station: by the distance there should have been another, but it is quite demolished. From the <HI>Quarry House</HI> to <HI>Elswick</HI> Windmill, Severus's wall is difficult to trace; but from thence to the fort on <HI>Benwell Hill,</HI> the appearance of the ditch is fre∣quently very distinct, and the track of wall (which keeps much upon the high road) pretty certain.</P>
<P>From the station at <HI>Newcastle</HI> (which is placed by these Antiquaries near the castle) to <HI>Benwell Hill,</HI> is near two miles and a furlong, and no inscriptions have been discovered in this space; at least none now remain, nor even the remembrance of any.</P>
<P>The situation of the station on <HI>Benwell Hill</HI> is high, and the prospect considerable: the ramparts are large and distinct, but the ditch scarce to be discerned. Hadrian's vallum seems to have fallen in with the south side of it, and Severus's wall strikes upon the east and west sides, so as to leave three chains to the north and six to the south; but there is no appearance of the wall and its ditch being continued through the fort, though <HI>Mr Gordon</HI> has so represented it. There are stones in the road that now crosses this fort, but these seem only to have been taken
<PB N="438" REF="453"/>
out of the ruins to repair the highway. This station falls in course to be <HI>Condercum,</HI> the name given in the <HI>Notitia</HI> to be the third in the se∣ries, where the <HI>Ala Prima Astorum</HI> was quartered.</P>
<P>From the station at <HI>Benwell Hill,</HI> Severus's wall and ditch, in going down to <HI>Denton,</HI> continue much in the same state as before; but Ha∣drian's work on this side begins to appear more conspicuous; both the walls pass to the north of the hill and village of <HI>Benwell;</HI> from <HI>Denton</HI> to the <HI>Chapel Houses,</HI> both the walls and their ditches are almost all the way visible and distinct: over-against <HI>West Denton Hall</HI> there seemed to be the visible remains of a castellum, and somewhat like the ruins of a Turret not very far from it.</P>
<P>Near the <HI>Chapel Houses,</HI> about a furlong south from Severus's wall, and less from Hadrian's, are somewhat like the ruins of a rampart: it is called <HI>the Castle Steads,</HI> the name usually given to those castella that are regularly placed along Severus's wall; but this (besides its being at some distance from the wall, which the others never are) appears to have been of a quite different form and dimensions; for it is about four chains long, with an interval in the middle, that looks like a gate, and so makes it appear very like the south rampart of a small fort: but if there have been ramparts on the other sides, no traces of them ap∣pear at present. The prospect here, especially to the south, is very con∣siderable; perhaps it has been an exploratory tower belonging to Ha∣drian's work, and prior to Severus's, and so neglected in his time. The usual castellum belonging to Severus's wall, is about a furlong west from the <HI>Chapel Houses,</HI> and visible there; so that the other can neither be one of these, nor intended to supply the place of one. From the name <HI>Chapel Houses,</HI> one would expect to find some ruinous <HI>chapel</HI> there; and I should have suspected somewhat of these ruins to have been of that nature, if the name <HI>Castle Steads</HI> had not determined against it.</P>
<P>From <HI>Chapel Houses</HI> to <HI>Wallbottle</HI> both walls and ditches are pretty visible, and continue so to <HI>Newburn Dean:</HI> but on the descent from the <HI>Chapel Houses</HI> to <HI>Wallbottle,</HI> Hadrian's north Agger becomes very con∣spicuous, and holds so for the most part to <HI>Newburn Dean.</HI> Between <HI>Wallbottle</HI> and this <HI>Dean</HI> is a castellum still very visible; and from the Dean to <HI>Throcklow,</HI> Hadrian's vallum and ditch are discernible, but not very large, and Severus's wall not quite so plain.</P>
<P><PB N="439" REF="454"/>Over-against <HI>Throcklow,</HI> in a convenient high place, there seems to be the ruins of another castellum; but near the village the vallum is very obscure. From <HI>Throcklow</HI> to <HI>Heddon on the Wall,</HI> Severus's wall and ditch are very conspicuous, and Hadrian's vallum and ditch near as visible. The north Agger is also discernible for part of the way, and near <HI>Heddon</HI> it is very considerable. Before we come to <HI>Heddon,</HI> there is on the north side of the wall, another place of the same nature with that at <HI>Chapel Houses,</HI> and called likewise <HI>Castle Steads.</HI> The re∣mains are very confused, and as it is altogether on the north of the wall, and detached a little from it, it seems to be a castellum erected prior to the wall, and neglected after the building of it. The prospect from this place is very good, which makes it the more likely to have been of the exploratory kind. However there seems to have been an usual castellum in Severus's wall, very near to these ruins; which is a further proof, that the other has not been used after the wall was erected. It seems to have been twice as large as one of Severus's cas∣tella, and yet not large enough for a station. Three sides, the north, east, and west, may be traced out, but the other is entirely levelled.</P>

<HEAD>HEDDON,</HEAD>
<P>commonly called <HI>Heddon on the Wall,</HI> was part of the barony of Hugh de Bolbeck, who gave the appropriation and advowson of the church here to the Abbey of Blanchland.</P>
<P>In Nov. 1752, the workmen employed in making the military road which leads from Carlisle, found a great number of curious Roman coins and medals in the ruins of the Roman wall here. They had been deposited in wood boxes, which were almost decayed: several of the medals were fresh and fair, as if but newly struck: some of them are of silver, but most part of copper and mixt metal. They are thought to be as valuable a collection as has been discovered for some centuries past.</P>
<P>Near <HI>Heddon on the Wall</HI> somewhat appears like Severus's military way, pretty near to his wall; but it is rather probable this appearance is nothing but the stones and ruins of the wall, and that the military ways have here coincided, because the north Agger is so large, though in a ploughed field: not far from this place there have been some re∣markable <HI>Tumuli.</HI> The village <HI>Heddon Lawes,</HI> which stands upon a
<PB N="440" REF="455"/>
hill, has no doubt had its name from such <HI>Tumuli.</HI> There is yet re∣maining one very great heap of stones, besides other <HI>Tumuli,</HI> and a re∣markable one farther to the east, called <HI>Dewly Lawe,</HI> with a smaller one near it. The whole hill is like the ruins of a quarry, but curious and worth the seeing. If regard be had to the distance of 12 miles from the sea, <HI>Heddon on the Wall</HI> would seem to be Bede's VILLA AD MURUM, and not either <HI>Wall's End</HI> or <HI>Wall Town.</HI></P>
<P>From <HI>Heddon</HI> to <HI>Rutchester,</HI> both the walls and their ditches are dis∣tinct; and a little before we come to <HI>Rutchester,</HI> Hadrian's north Agger is distinct. Here is another castellum, the remains of which are very visible, and an oval fort, (though it seems not to be Roman) near it. The whole distance between the station at <HI>Benwell Hill</HI> and this at <HI>Rutchester,</HI> is six measured miles and three quarters; in this space there are six visible castella, in a series without interruption, and the constant exact measure between them is, six furlongs and three quar∣ters; and the whole distance between the two stations, six measured miles and three quarters: the two castella that have been next the fort at <HI>Benwell Hill,</HI> have no visible remains.</P>

<P><PB N="441" REF="456"/>Newburn was a place of consequence and note preceding the con∣quest. Copsi who was created Earl of Northumberland by King William, was put to death here. Osulf the preceding Governor, expelled by the Conqueror to give place to Copsi, being forced into the woods and de∣serts, lay concealed till he had collected a few hardy troops; with these he besieged Copsi, and at length obliged him to take refuge in the church. Osulf disregarding all veneration for things sacred, when put in competition with his desperate fortune and revenge, set fire to the holy pile; and as Copsi endeavoured to shun the flames, he was seized, and his head severed on the spot.</P>
<P>At this village, on the 28th of August, 16 King Charles I. A. D. 1640, Lord Conway with an army of 3000 foot and 1500 horse, opposed the passage of the Scots over the river Tyne, led by Lesley.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>In Rushworth's Historical Collections, there is a very particular relation of this affair, p. 1236.</P>
<P><Q>On the twenty seventh of Aug. (1640) in the forenoon, his Majesty received intelligence from the Lord Conway, that the Scots would that night be near Newcastle with their army, craving his Majesty's pleasure and directions about the disposing of his army to the interrup∣tion of the march of the Scots.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The King immediately called the Gentry of Yorkshire, then at York, together, to wait upon his Majesty, to whom the Earl of Strafford made a speech, presently after he prepared a pacquet to be sent post to the Lord Conway, then understanding the Scots were come near Newcastle; and the author of these Collections being newly come post from London to York, and hearing a pacquet was about to be sent to Newcastle, took the opportunity to bear the messenger company therewith: but when the author and the messenger with the pacquet came to Newcastle upon the 28th of August in the morning, they were informed, that the Lord Conway was gone to the army near Newburn, whither we went immediately, and found the Lord Conway and the Field Officers at a Council of War at Stella, half a mile dis∣tant from the army, and delivered the Lord Conway the pacquet, which being opened, it contained special orders to prepare the army for an engagement with the Scots. Whilst 
<PB N="442" REF="457"/>they were in debate in this matter an Herald came in all haste from the army, to acquaint the Lord Conway and Council of War, that the army was already engaged with the Scots; which seemed strange to them, because orders were given not to fight but upon the defence.</Q></P>
<P>On the 27th of August, <Q>The Scots pitched their tents on Heddon Law, above Newborne, from whence there went a continued descent to the river of Tyne. In the night time they made great fires in and round about their camp, on an open moorish ground, (having coals plenty thereabouts) so that the camp seemed to be of large compass and extent.</Q></P>
<P><Q>That night and the next morning they suffered any Englishman to come into their camp, and made them welcome, with expressions of great love and protestations of doing harm to none but those who should oppose them in demanding justice of the King against incendiaries.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The same night part of the King's army, consisting of 3000 foot and 1500 horse, were drawn forth into a plain meadow ground, which was near a mile in length, close on the south side of Tyne, called Newborne Haugh or Stella Haugh, to hinder the Scots from pas∣sing the river in the night time, where were two several sconces or breast-works, raised by the English against the two fords, which the Scots might pass over at low water, for 'till then they could not pass the Tyne, and into each sconce were put four hundred musqueteers and four pieces of ordinance.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The horse were drawn into squadrons in the said Haugh, at some distance from the foot; in this posture horse and foot guarded the river all that night and the next day, till the engagement.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The Scots all the forenoon watered their horses at one side of the river, and the English on the other side, without affronting one another, or giving any reproachful language.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The Scots having the advantage of the rising ground above Newborne, easily discerned the posture and motion of the English army below in the valley, on the south side the river; but the posture of the Scots army the English could not discern by reason of the houses, hedges, and inclosures in and about Newborne. The Scots brought down cannon into Newborne town, and planted some in the church steeple, a small distance from the river Tyne: their mus∣queteers were placed in the church, houses, lanes, and hedges, in and about Newborne.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The skirmish began thus, (as the author of these Collections was informed, being then upon the place) a Scottish officer, well mounted, having a black feather in his hat, came out of one of the thatcht houses in Newborne, and watered his horse in the river Tyne, as they had done all that day; an English soldier perceived he fixed his eye towards the Eng∣lish trenches on the south side of the river, fired at him, (whether in earnest or to fright him is not known) but wounded the Scotchman with the shot, who fell off his horse, where∣upon the Scottish musqueteers immediately fired upon the English, and so the fight begun with small shot, but was continued with great shot as well as small.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The Scots played with their cannon upon the English breast-works and sconce; the King's army played with their cannon to beat the Scots out of the church steeple; thus they con∣tinued firing on both sides, 'till it grew to be near low water, and by that time the Scots, with their cannon, had made a breach in the greater sconce, which Colonel Lunsford com∣manded, wherein many of his men were killed and began to retire, yet the Colonel prevailed with them to stand to their arms; but presently after a Captain, a Lieutenant, and some other officers were slain in that work: then the soldiers took occasion to complain, that they were put upon double duty, and had stood there all night and that day to that time, and that no soldiers were sent from the army at Newcastle to relieve them; but Col. Lunsford again prevailed with them not to desert their works, but another cannon shot hitting in the works amongst the souldiers, and killing some more of them, they threw down their arms, and would abide in the fort no longer.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="443" REF="458"/><Q>The enemy on the rising ground above Newbourne, plainly discerned the posture of the King's army, and how the souldiers had quit the great work, and being low water, the Scots commanded a forlorn party of 26 horse, being gentlemen of the College of Justice Troop, to pass the river, which they did with some swiftness; their orders were only to make discovery in what posture the souldiers were about the uppermost work, but not to come to close engagement, but fire at a distance and retreat.</Q></P>
<P>The Scots playing at this time very hard upon the furthermost trench, forced the English <Q>foot to retreat from that work also, which the Scots discerning on the rising ground at Newborne, commanded by Sir Thomas Hope, and two regiments of foot commanded by the Lord Craford, Lindsey, and Lord Lowdon, waded through the river, and General Lesley at this instant of time played hard with nine pieces of cannon, from a new sconce which they had raised on a hill to the east, and so galled the King's horse, drawn up in plain meadow ground, that it much disordered them, and sending more forces over the river, a retreat was sounded, and Colonel Lunsford drew off the cannon. Immediately Commissary Wil∣mot, son to the Lord Wilmot, Sir John Digby, a Romish Recusant, and Daniel O'Neal, an Irishman, jointly engaged the enemy, and had a sharp encounter with their horse, they being commanded to bring up the rear, whilst the foot retreated up Ryton and Stella Banks; but the Scots, with their fresh supply newly come over the river, environed these three com∣manders, and took them and some others of their troops prisoners. General Lesley treated these commanders nobly in the Scots camp, and afterwards gave them their liberty freely to return to the King's army.</Q></P>
<P><Q>In this engagement Cornet Potter, son of Endymion Potter of the Bed-chamber, was slain, and during the whole fight about 60 men more, as the Scots told us, after the cessation of arms was agreed unto, for the Scots buried the dead; and afterwards they further told us, that most of them that were killed lay about the works: how many of the Scots were slain we know not.</Q></P>
<P><Q>After this retreat the Lord Conway called a Council of War, and it was there resolved, at twelve at night, that the whole army should retreat to Durham, horse, and foot, and train of artillery, and to quit Newcastle.</Q></P>
<PB N="441" REF="456"/></NOTE> The Scots

with great intrepidity passed the river, breast deep, in the face of the English army, who were drawn up on the opposite banks. Three hun∣dred Scotch horse were obliged to repass the river, being opposed by a

The foot were soon ashamed of their flight, wishing to repair their disgrace, and revenge it on a foe, who hardly credited their own success; but the timid General uninfluenced by the same sense of honour, never afterwards turned his face to the enemy.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Clarendon.</NOTE> Lord Clarendon calls this defeat, an irreparable rout.

It is divided into 7 wards; has 4 chief rivers, Tyne, Tweed, Alne, and Coquet; is within the dio∣cese of Durham, and gives a Ducal title. Newcastles lies in lat. 55:0, whose distance and bearing from London in measured miles is 278½ N. W.</P>

<P><PB N="446" REF="461"/>The lands produce fine corn. On the banks of Tweed excellent cattle are bred, of which some have come to the weight of 160 stone (14lb. to the stone): the ordinary cattle in the interior parts of the
<PB N="447" REF="462"/>
country, are of a middle size and mixed breed, between Dutch and Scotch, which are very beautiful, and yield abundance of milk: smaller cattle, of the Highland kind, are bred in the mountainous parts. The
<PB N="448" REF="463"/>
hills afford fine sheep walks, and the flocks are numerous: in some parts of the county, of late years, they have been much improved, by the in∣troduction
<PB N="449" REF="464"/>
of Leicestershire and Lincolnshire sheep; by which cross the fleeces are become much better, and the sheep feed to an improved weight. Few of the large sheep are kept in this county.</P>
<P><PB N="450" REF="465"/>Improved husbandry makes a rapid progress, and enclosures take place of the wide extended tracts, where many Herdsmen were hereto∣fore necessarily employed to keep the cattle and flocks within their bounds.</P>
<P><PB N="451" REF="466"/>For so large a tract of land, there are few considerable woods of tim∣ber trees, and planting seems to proceed but languidly; except in the vale of Whittingham and some other tracts, where a laudable example has been given.</P>
<P><PB N="452" REF="467"/>The rivers abound with salmon and trout, and the coasts with cod, ling, turbot, soles, place, whitings, haddocks, crabs, lobsters, muscles, and cockles.</P>
<P><PB N="453" REF="468"/>The great staple of Northumberland is coal. By the following tables, the importance of this county to the state at large will appear, in its

exports and numbers of ships. From that concise plan, the produce is immediately deduced, in all its articles of trade. By the imports is
<PB N="455" REF="470"/>
shewn how few foreign articles are wanted to contribute to the pleasures and luxuries of life, other than those produced within its own limits.</P>

<HEAD>ANCIENT CUSTOMS Which prevail in the COUNTY of NORTHUMBERLAND, WITH CONJECTURES THEREON.</HEAD>
<HEAD><PB REF="494"/>ANCIENT CUSTOMS, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>MANY ancient Customs prevail in this County, the familiarity or outward insignificance of which occasion them to pass without much attention: but as they are the strongest traditional memorials of antiquity, I thought them worth collecting, and present them to the Reader with some short Conjectures on their origin, and the historical facts to which they have relation.</P>
<P>Mr Bryant's words are, <Q>We talk indeed of ancient times, and times of Antiquity; but that time is most aged which has endured longest, and these are the most ancient days in which we are ourselves conversant. We enjoy now an age of accumulated experience, and we are to make use of the helps which have been transmitted, to dispel the mist which has preceded.</Q> Let∣ters have afforded the accumulation; before their use, the dissolution of every state was the dissipation of its science and wisdom: arts and collective know∣ledge were destroyed with the empire in which they flourished, and only a few scattered fragments and distracted ruins remained to save them from total oblivion. By letters we possess the wisdom of all quarters of the earth; times which have preceded their use left us chiefly traditional fragments, scattered abroad in national customs, and provincial names and phrases.</P>
<P>In the course of this Collection I shall remark whatever Mr Bourne, in his "Popular Antiquities," has noticed, with some of the illucidations and judi∣cious constructions given by his late Editor, the Rev. Mr John Brand.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>BABBA.</HEAD>
<P>The common and most tender appellation of an infant is <HI>Babba.</HI> This name Mr Bryant, in his Analysis of ancient Mythology, says, is derived from the exclamation made by the congregation during the ceremony of purification, by passing infants through the fire of Molock. Fire worship was used in this country, and in the Druidical rites such ceremony might be retained; for they held many customs so similar to those of the Hebrews, that it strengthens the idea greatly they were communicated by the Phoenecians, or introduced from Germany, where the Amonians most certainly were well known. The Saxons also introduced their customs; they were worshippers of fire, and might hold such office of purification.</P>

<HEAD>GIFTS to INFANTS.</HEAD>
<P>Children when <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>st sent abroad in the arms of the nurse to visit a neigh∣bour, are presented with an egg, salt, and fine bread. The egg was a sacred emblem, and seems a gift well adapted to infancy. Mr Bryant says, <Q>An egg, containing in it the elements of life, was thought no improper emblem of the ark, in which were preserved the rudiments of the future world: hence in the Dionusiaca, and in other mysteries, one part of the nocturnal ceremony consisted in the consecration of an egg. By this, as we are in∣formed by Porphyry, was signified the world. It seems to have been a favourite symbol, and very ancient, and we find it adopted among many nations. It was said by the Persians of Oromasdes, that he formed mankind and inclosed them in an egg.</Q> Cakes and Salt were used in religious rites by the ancients: The Jews probably adopted their appropriation from the Egyptians; <Q>And if thou bring an oblation of a meat offering baken in the oven, it shall be unleavened cakes of fine flour, &amp;c. <BIBL>Lev. ii. 4.</BIBL></Q> <Q>With all thine offerings thou shalt offer salt. <BIBL>Ibid. 13.</BIBL></Q> There was a custom in the Romish church of making a cake in honour of the Holy Virgin's time of child-birth, which was condemned by a canon in the Council of Trullus.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>p.

<HEAD>DOUBLING the THUMB.</HEAD>
<P>Children, to avoid approaching danger, are taught to double the thumb within the hand. This was much practised whilst the terrors of witchcraft remained; and even in the beginning of the present century, much of those unhappy prejudices possessed the minds of the vulgar. It was a custom to fold the thumbs of dead persons within the hand, to prevent the power of evil spirits over the deceased; the thumb in that position forming the similitude of the character in the Hebrew Alphabet, which is commonly used to denote the name of God.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>NEW YEAR's DAY.</HEAD>
<P>The celebration of New Year's Day is preserved in this country as a rural festival. Gifts are made to children, servants, and dependants, called New Year's Gifts. Mr Bourne quotes what Stillingfleet says, <Q>That among the Saxons of the northern nations, the feast of the New Year was observed with more than ordinary jollity;</Q> and, from Hospinian, says, <Q>It was an ancient custom of the Heathens, and afterwards practised by the Chris∣tians.</Q> Servants were exempt from their labour, and partook of the feast and rural sports with their masters: they were presented with tokens of appro∣bation and favour. On certain festivals, the Romans gave pieces of money to travellers and strangers who were present at the sacrifice. On our day of festivity, mirth is excited by a rustic masquerading and playing tricks in dis∣guise: the hide of the ox slain for the winter cheer, is often put on, and the
<PB N="5" REF="496"/>
person thus attired, attempts to shew the character of the devil, by every hor∣rible device in his power. All the winter sports seem to express a strong opi∣nion of the ancients, that Genii of very contrary natures prevailed on earth, that the one was constantly concomitant to light as the other was to dark∣ness; and this image of the devil, which is frequently permitted to expel the inhabitants and take possession of the house, is typical of the power of the evil genius, in the season when the sun is longest absent from our hemisphere. This corresponds with the lamentation used by those who held the Elusinian mysteries, and mourned for Adonis. It is very difficult to make any probable determination to what people we owe these customs. In the Roman Saturnalia and Sigillaria, this kind of frolicking was practised. Among the observations made by Mr Brand on Bourne's XIV Chap. he remarks, that there was an ancient custom for young women to go about with a waffail bowl, that is, "a bowl of spiced ale," on New Year's Eve, with some sort of verses that were sung by them in going from door to door. Waffail is derived from the Anglo Sax. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> that is, "Be in health."</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>TWELFTH DAY.</HEAD>
<P>The twelfth day after the day of our Saviour's birth is attended with great festivity. There are diversions used in the southern parts of England, which have not reached this northern county. The mirth of the day here consists of feasting and a social intercourse between neighbouring families. Mr Brand makes a happy quotation from Collier's Eccl. Hist. vol. I. p. 163, in his obser∣vations on Bourne's Chap. XVII. <Q>In the days of King Aelfrid a law was made with relation to the holydays, by virtue of which the 12 days after the nativity of our Saviour were made festivals.</Q> So much as these feasts have been decried, I cannot see them in the despicable light many modern authors have been pleased to place them. They were the occasion of gathering neigh∣bours together, in good humour with each other, and the means of keeping them on terms of intimacy: friendship and benevolence were thereby increased, and good offices multiplied: public matters at such times were discussed and amicably determined; and those happy effects resulted which tended not only to the advantage of the individual, but to the good of society at large. This age is refined into insipidity: few of the old hospitable days return: sociability is sickened into unmeaning ceremony. In ancient times the bard was brought to the festive hall, to rehearse the Excellencies of our ancestors, to fire the breast with emulation, to inspire noble and bounteous sentiments, and lift us, through example, into an adoption of the character of those heroes and men of honour from whom we were descended: then it was the genial spirit was roused, and benevolence prevailed. The name of friendship is retained in our language, and the real character is somewhere still found to exist; but it is chiefly in middle life; the great and opulent in general have little experience of it: each apparently separates himself from community, and is involved in his own circle. The distinguishing characteristicks, which in former days pur∣chased a man fortune and fame, are become intrinsic trifles, with which he
<PB N="6" REF="497"/>
may amuse himself, but purchase little patronage: the vice is contaminating, it is creeping into the vitals of lower life, and where the insipidity will end is beyond modern magic to divine. What would be the consequence, should adverse ages ever bring on exigences of state? The old popular influence of the great no longer existing! the distances between ranks of men still extend∣ing their separation! The celebrated fable points out the politics which would prevail with the lowest classes of men, <Q>If we are only to be regarded for servility, it is indifferent to us to whom we are servants.</Q> There is nothing keeps this part of the state within rule, but the fear of still worsning the condition.</P>

<HEAD>BLACK MAILE PAYMENT.</HEAD>
<P>This customary collection of money, corn, and cattle, was taken away in consequence of the accession of King James I. There was a law indeed made in the 43d year of the reign of Queen Elizabeth, to restrain the Black Maile Payment, and correct the enormities from whence it arose; but whilst the contentions between the nations continued it had little effect. This was a levy made within this county by the chieftains on the borders, for protections against the depredations made by the robbers and spoil-takers, afterwards called Moss Troopers. The receivers were in league with the banditti.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>HEAD PENCE PAYMENT.</HEAD>
<P>This was an exaction made by the Sheriff of Northumberland, amounting to 40l. or more, twice in seven years. It was received for an exemption from attendance at the Sheriff's torn; and thereupon the Lords of Manors held their leet, where the suitors, for their greater convenience, were permitted to attend and make what in the law books is called their <HI>Suit Royal.</HI> This exaction was totally surpressed by the Statute made in the 23d year of King Hen. VI. c. 7.</P>
<P>I have noticed these two obsolete customs, because not only their names, but also some memorials of them remain on the borders, and in the moun∣tainous parts of the county.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>CANDLEMAS DAY.</HEAD>
<P>It is little noted in this county, but by name. Several religious rites were made peculiar to it in the Romish church. In the quotation of St Gregory's Letter, in the notes to p. 27 in the second volume of the work, a reason is given for not abolishing the Pagan ceremonies, in countries where conversion was taking place; but it was commanded to adapt them to christian ceremo∣nies: and this seems to carry with it a strong reason for the similarity there was in many of the ceremonies of the christian church in the first ages and the Pagan rites. Mr Brand, in his observations on Bourne's XIX chap. from
<PB N="7" REF="498"/>
Bacon's Reliques of Rome, fo. 164, makes a quotation which informs us, that the Romans, in the service of their God Mars, and his mother Februa, made processions in the city of Rome with lighted torches; the remains of which custom still existing with the vulgar in the time of Pope Sergius: he com∣manded that it should be converted into an holy office of the christian church, and that the congregation on the same day made their approach to the high altar with lighted tapers, in honour of the Holy Virgin. Those who sigh for the sanctity of the church in such reviews of her ceremonies, must consider this was done to conciliate the minds of those long used in such spectacles and solemn shews; and that an austerity which should at once have abolished such acts, to which almost every mind was prejudiced, would have greatly re∣tarded, if not totally prevented the progress of conversion.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>St AGNES' FAST.</HEAD>
<P>It is not yet pointed out when or where this had its rise. It is a fast kept by women desirous of dreaming of their lovers, and thence to derive pro∣pitious indications touching wedlock. It is the remains of the old super∣stition of divination; but why fixed to the day of St Agnes is not to be accounted for.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>VALENTINE DAY</HEAD>
<P>is an anniversary day of divination by lots. It is a common saying, that birds on this day choose their mates. It may have relation to some domestic birds, and also rooks and pigeons. The custom now is, that the names of young people are wrote on scrols of paper, and each draws one, confident that marriages are made in heaven, and in full hope the lot of life will be pointed out. What particular attention the allotted swain in former days was obliged to pay the fair one, to whose hands his name had fallen, I have not discovered. Mr Brand, in his observations on Bourne's XXth chap. quotes a passage in Moresin to this purpose: <Q>That at this festival, the men used to make the women presents, as upon another occasion the women used to do to the men; but that in Scotland on this day presents were reciprocal.</Q> Mr Pen∣nant speaks of this custom in Scotland, by which young people try prognosti∣cations of their future fortunes in the nuptial state. The first inventor of this custom must have been some benevolent female, who studied to encourage the intercourse of the sexes; for by such means intimacies might arise, productive of love and marriage engagements: or otherwise the first design of those lots was, that those who shared in the dances and diversions, might have their proper partners assigned, without hazarding the confusion and displeasure which must necessarily arise in the liberty of choice.</P>
<P>There was a religious sect of Valentinians, but I find no ceremony used by them or tenet they embraced, which could have any relation to these customs.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<PB N="8" REF="499"/>
<HEAD>SHROVE TIDE.</HEAD>
<P>It is particularly observed. Shrove is derived from <HI>Shrive,</HI> confession; a preparation enjoined in the Romish church, previous to the duties of Lent. It was particularly prescribed, that all offences should be mutually forgiven, and reconciliation take place, before they entered upon the solemnities of Lent; and this was consequently a day of mutual intercourse and amity. In several ancient Roman Catholic families, the kitchen is opened, and every neighbour and passenger is permitted to enter and fry a pancake, for which the necessary provision is made ready. This seems to be derived from a custom in the refectory of religious houses, where the table was spread on this day for all pilgrims, travellers, and visitants. In Newcastle, Durham, and other places, the great bell of the church is tolled, the servants have holyday, and whoever partakes of the pancakes of the day must fry them; a circumstance which occasions high kitchen mirth. In the keeping of the vigils of all solemn days, the ceremony began at noon. The ringing of the great bell at noon was a signal to clear the larder of flesh meat, from which time its use was prohibited. In Mr Brand's Appendix to Bourne's Pop. Antiq. he says, <Q>A kind of pan∣cake feast preceding Lent was used in the Greek church, from whence probably we have borrowed it.</Q> One of the chief diversions of the day is fighting of cocks. Moresin says this was derived from the Athenians, who exhibited cock fightings on one day in each year, an institution of The∣mistockley; and that those of the Romish church derived the custom on this day from thence. The inference is ridiculous. It was a general holyday, and this was one of the vulgar dissipations, no otherwise peculiar to the season, than that the animal was in good feather at this time of the year, and in condition for the greatest exertion of powers.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>ASH WEDNESDAY.</HEAD>
<P>The name only remains, the peculiar customs are forgotten. Penitents expressed their humiliation by sackcloth and ashes. Fuller in his Church Hist. p. 222, mentions a custom <Q>Of giving ashes on Ash Wednesday, to put in remembrance every christian man in the beginning of Lent and Pennance, that he is but ashes and earth, and thereto shall return.</Q> In the protestant church the commination or service contains a public rehearsal of those curses which we find denounced in the scriptures, and which, with an impious arro∣gance, we interlard with an amen; (not with a petition for eversion) assuming a right of denunciation and judgment, when humiliation, contrition, and tears would better befit the congregation in the rehearsal of the very curses by which the most of them probably stand condemned.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>CARLING DAY.</HEAD>
<P>The second Sunday preceding Easter is called Carling Sunday. The peculiar custom is the serving up parched peas to the table. This seems to be derived
<PB N="9" REF="500"/>
from the severities of the Romish church in the early ages, at this period in Lent, in their abstinence and mortification using such food. This was called Passion Sunday; and Mr Brand quotes Marshall on the Saxon Gospels, vol. I. p. 536, where it is said, Care or Carr Sunday was not unknown to the English in his time. Mr Brand adds, It was usual to give away beans in the dole at funerals, both with the Heathen and the people of the Romish church. They are used as a kind of mourning dole on this day. Erasmus mentions an observation of Pliny's, concerning Pythagoras's Interdiction of the use of Beans, "that they contain the souls of the dead." Thence they were used in the Parentalia. Plutarch held, that pulse was of the highest efficacy for in∣voking the manes. The adoption by Christians can only be reconciled by the preceding arguments touching Heathen rites. The modern Greeks carry in funeral processions parboiled wheat.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>PALM SUNDAY.</HEAD>
<P>On this day is still retained the ancient usage of dressing windows with ever-greens, &amp;c. in commemoration of our Saviour's entry into Jerusalem. It was the custom of the ancient Christian church to represent, by solemn shews, even the most tremendous occurrences in the history of our Saviour —a procession with palms was used. In this country the buds of the saugh, which is one of the earliest marks of vegetation the trees of the climate shew, are gathered and adopted for branches of palm. Mr Bourne says, the branch of palm was used in the country near Jerusalem as an emblem of victory. Our adoption of the saugh buds may arise from their being the first bloom the woods wear after winter is subdued, and might be used also typically, from their bearing testimony of renovation, as a sacred emblem of victory over death.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>EASTER DAY</HEAD>
<P>is attended with several singular customs. The people rise before the sun, in hopes to see the great luminary ascend the horizon, dancing for joy. This has been an innocent artifice to draw forth the vulgar to early devotion; and what could be more powerfully typical and figurative to ignorant minds that conceive few images of the resurrection of our Lord, than that of a glo∣rious and resplendent sun, rising from a gilded horizon, dispelling every gloom and shade, and dispensing light, beauty, and joy over the face of the earth. It was a season and a spectacle, under the immediate impressions of which, well adapted and pathetic exhortations would take a deep root. The Druids and Saxons both had made it a chief object of worship, and the time of sun rising the chief season for their religious rites and adorations; of these, strong prejudices would remain with the vulgar. Bourne says, the salutation of the eastern church on this day was, "The Lord is risen," and the usual answer was, "The Lord is risen indeed;" and no doubt they were peculiar to the morning.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="501"/>The children have dyed and gilded eggs given them, which are called <HI>Paste Eggs,</HI> a supposed corruption of <HI>Pasche Eggs.</HI> Eggs were held by the Egyptians as a sacred emblem of the renovation of mankind after the deluge. The Jews adopted it to suit the circumstances of their history, as a type of their depar∣ture from the land of Egypt; and it was used in the Feast of the Passover as part of the furniture of the table with the paschal lamb. The Christians have certainly used it on this day, as retaining the elements of future life, for an emblem of the resurrection. Mr Brand has many well chosen quotations on this subject, among which is a prayer extracted from the ritual of Pope Paul the Vth, made for the use of England, Ireland, and Scotland.</P>
<P><Q>Bless, O Lord, we beseech thee, this thy creature of eggs, that it may become a wholesome sustenance to thy faithful servants, eating it in thank∣fulness to thee, <HI>on account of the resurrection</HI> of our Lord Jesus Christ, who with thee,</Q> &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>He quotes from Dr Chandler's Travels in Asia Minor a passage, in which it appears, those of the Greek church on this day presented coloured eggs. In Russia there is the like custom, which he shews in two quotations, one from the Abbè d' Auteroche, in his Journey to Siberia, and the other from Hakluyt's Voyage 1589. But from all the quotations no determination is drawn why the <HI>painted Eggs</HI> were used on this day peculiarly, and especially being no part of the day's repast. The field of conjecture is open and at large to every one. It seems as if the Egg was thus decorated for a religious trophy after the days of mortification and abstinence were over, and festivity had taken place; and as an emblem of the renovation of life, certified to us by the resurrection from the regions of death and the grave.</P>
<P>Mr Brand, p. 252, gives us the following note: <Q><HI>Erasmus speaking of the proverb,</HI> Mea est Pila, <HI>that is,</HI> I have got the ball, <HI>tells us that it signifies</HI> I have obtained the victory, I am master of my wishes.</Q> The Romanists certainly erected a standard on Easter Day in token of our Lord's victory; but it would perhaps be indulging fancy too far to suppose that the Bishops and Governors of churches, who used to condescend to play at <HI>hand ball</HI> at this time, did it in a mystical way, and with reference to the triumphal joy of the season. Cer∣tain it is, however, that many of their customs and superstitions are founded on still more trivial circumstances than even this imaginary analogy.</P>
<P>It was an ancient custom for the Mayor, Aldermen, and Sheriff of New∣castle, accompanied with great numbers of the Burgesses to go every year at the feasts of Easter and Whitsuntide to the Forth, the little mall of the town, with the maces, sword, and cap of maintenance carried before them. The young people of the town still assemble there, at this season particularly, play at hand ball, dance, &amp;c. but are no longer countenanced in their innocent festivity by the presence of their Governors, who no doubt in ancient times
<PB N="11" REF="502"/>
used to unbend the brow of authority, and partake with their happy and con∣tented people, the puerile pleasures of the festive season.</P>
<P>It was also usual among the sports of the day to have foot courses, &amp;c. the prize being a <HI>tansey cake.</HI> It has been alledged, that the use of <HI>tansey</HI> was adopted from the Jewish mess of bitter herbs at this season. A discussion of this practice of the Jews would be too tedious in this place, and articles of mortification seem not to correspond with the universal festivity of the time; I rather conceive that the prizes were the ancient sweet bread, concerning the use of which I shall have occasion to make some remarks in the sequel, and that <HI>tansey</HI> was used for its flavour and salubrity only.</P>
<P>Mr Brand quotes Durand Lib. 6. c. 86. 9. for a very singular and unreason∣able custom, <Q>That on Easter Day wives used to beat their husbands, and on the day following husbands their wives:" and he adds, "There is a custom still retained at the city of Durham on these holydays, on one day the men take off the women's shoes, which are only to be redeemed by a present, and on another day the women take off the men's in like manner.</Q> This custom is not a peculiarity of the city of Durham only, but extends into other parts of that county, as well as Northumberland. As it seems to be the remains of some religious ceremony, if peculiar to the cathedral it would pro∣bably travel with the See from Lindisfarn by Chester to Durham, and its re∣mains would be found scattered through this passage. In Lancashire the cus∣tom of the day is to lift the passenger from the ground: this shews of itself of what it is emblematical. But our custom leaves us wide and indeterminate conjectures. In the cathedral of Durham there was a custom on Good Friday for the Monks to approach the high altar, then decorated with all the solemn emblems of that tremendous day, on their knees, being bare footed. On Easter Day they made a solemn procession, when all the spectators pulled off their shoes, as treading on holy ground. King Canute approached the shrine of St. Cuthbert from Garmondsway, the distance of five miles, with all his re∣tinue and attendants bare-footed; when he gave great territories and donations to that church. Lel. Col. vol. I. p. 331. These are the most memorable circum∣stances I have been able to collect. Preparatory to the passover, our Saviour washed the feet of the Disciples; after which he gave them this ordonance: "For I have given you an example, that you should do as I have done to you." The Monks of Durham are said to have washed the feet of the poor, within the cloister, in commemoration of our Saviour's act. In the ages immediately suc∣ceeding the conversion of the Britons, an inveterate hatred and contempt was shewn to all Jews, who by shipwreck or other casualty came among them; even to a greater bitterness the aversion was carried, than against the uncon∣verted Heathen. The order of the passover ceremonies, as set forth in the 12th chapter of Exodus, enjoins the Jews to have their shoes upon their feet: per∣haps in contradistinction, or in reproach of the Jews, the shoes of passengers are pulled off.</P>

<HEAD>SWEET BREAD.</HEAD>
<P>I intimated in the preceding pages, an intention of remarking the <HI>Sweet Bread</HI> used in religious rites. Small loaves of bread, peculiar in their form, being long and sharp at both ends, are called Buns. This name takes place where old religious ceremonies have been solemnized, derived from the consecrated sweet bread, which was offered on high festivals. It is of the highest antiquity; according to Mr Bryant, <Q>the offerings which people in ancient times used to present to the Gods, were generally purchased at the entrance of the temple; especially every species of consecrated bread, which was denominated accord∣ingly. One species of sacred bread which used to be offered to the Gods, was of great antiquity, and called <HI>Boun.</HI> The Greeks who changed the <HI>Nu</HI> final into a <HI>sigma,</HI> expressed it in the nominative <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, but in the accusative more truly <HI>Boun,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. Hesychius speaks of the <HI>Boun,</HI> and describes it <HI>a kind of cake with a representation of two horns.</HI> Julius Pollux mentions it after the same manner, <HI>a sort of cake with horns.</HI> Diogenes Laertius, speaking of the same offering being made by Empedocles, describes the chief ingredients of which it was composed: "<HI>He offered up one of the sacred liba, called a Boun, which was made of fine flour and honey.</HI> It is said of Cecrops, <HI>he first offered up this sort of sweet bread.</HI> Hence we may judge of the antiquity of the custom, from the times to which Cecrops is referred. The prophet Jeremiah takes notice of this kind of offering, when he is speaking of the Jewish women at Pathros in Egypt, and of their base idolatry; in all which their husbands had encouraged them; the women in their expostulation upon his rebuke tell him, <HI>Did we make her cakes to worship her?</HI> &amp;c. Jer. xliv. 18, 19. lb. vii. 18.</Q> Bryant's Analysis, vol. I. p. 297. The sacred cakes which were offered at the Arkite temples were styled <HI>Boun,</HI> and were presented upon every seventh day. Bryant, vol. II. The custom of hot <HI>Cross Buns</HI> in London, on the morning of Good Friday, seems to have relation to these ancient practices: We only retain the name and form of the <HI>Boun;</HI> the sacred uses are no more.</P>

<HEAD>HOCK-TIDE.</HEAD>
<P>Hock-days Þucx-daeg Dies irrisorius, a time of scorning or triumphing: a festival of the common people held soon after Easter. The servants had liberty of divers sports and diversions, and in compensation for the loss of time in their service, the masters were intitled to a gratuity. It was held in com∣memoration of the day on which the Danes were massacred, A. D. 1002; and such were the licentious enormities committed therein, the servants deeming themselves, during this festival, under no law of subordination, that it was pro∣hibited by the church in the fifteenth century, under pain of excommunica∣tion. The remains of this festival seem to be retained in our <HI>fools day,</HI> the 1st of April, when all sorts of ridiculous tricks are practiced to render the person you meet with a scoff and jest: it may be presumed the persons who, from their connections and intercourse with the Danes, lamented the horrid slaughter were thus scoffed and ridiculed; and those who were ignorant of the event, sent on fruitless errands to their dying friends, weltering in gore.

<HEAD>MAY-DAY.</HEAD>
<P>It still retains some of its ancient sports. The young people of both sexes go out early in the morning of the 1st day of May, to gather the flowering thorns and the dew of the grass, which they bring home with music and acclamations; and having dressed a poll on the town-green with garlands, dance around it. The dew was considered as a grand cosmetick, and pre∣served the face from wrinkles, blotches, and the traces of old age: the hap∣piest gift Flora could bestow on her votaries. It seems from these remains, that this festival was introduced by the Romans, who observed it in honour of Flora. What particular rites originally attended it with that people we shall not enquire: at present it is celebrated only with mirth, innocence, and love. The Druids, who were the priests of the God of nature, and celebrated every remarkable period in the change of seasons, left a memorial of their reli∣gious rites on this day, very different from those instituted in honour of the notorious divinity Flora; that is, a Bel-tein rural sacrifice. It is to be traced in the mountainous and uncultivated parts of Cumberland, among the Cheviots, and in many parts of Scotland. Mr Pennant gives a particular description in his Tour in Scotland: <Q>On the first of May, in the Highlands of Scotland, the herdsmen of every village hold their Beltein: they cut a square trench in the ground, leaving the turf in the middle: on that they make a fire of wood, on which they dress a large caudle of eggs, butter, oatmeal, and milk, and bring, besides the ingredients of the caudle, plenty of beer and whisky; for each of the company must contribute something. The rites begin with spilling some of the caudle on the ground, by way of liba∣tion;
<PB N="14" REF="505"/>
on that every one takes a cake of oatmeal, upon which are raised nine square knobs, each dedicated to some particular being, the supposed pre∣server of their flocks and herds, or to some particular animal, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>al destroyer of them; each person then turns his face to the fire, breaks off a knob, and flinging it over his shoulder, says, this I give to thee, preserve thou my horses; this to thee, preserve thou my sheep, and so on. After that they use the same ceremony to the noxious animals: this I give to thee, O fox! spare thou my lambs: this to thee, O hooded crow! this to thee, eagle! when the ceremony is over, they dine on the caudle,</Q> &amp;c.</P>
<P>We retain something of this kind in the syllabub, prepared for the May feast, which is made of warm milk from the cow, sweet cake, and wine; and a kind of divination is practised, by fishing with a ladle for a wedding ring, which is dropt into it for the purpose of prognosticating who shall be first married.</P>
<P>Mr Brand, in his Observations on Bourne's XXV chap. makes several quo∣tations from a pamphlet, intitled, "The way to things by words, and to words by things." He says, <Q>We gather from him that our ancestors hold an anniversary assembly on May-day; the <HI>Column of May</HI> (whence our May Pole) was the great standard of justice in the <HI>Ey-commons</HI> or fields of May. Here it was that people, if they saw cause, deposed or punished their Governors, their Barons, their Kings. The garland or crown when hung on the top of the <HI>May</HI> or Pole, was the great signal for convening the people. This was one of the ancientest customs, which from the remotest ages, has been by repetition from year to year perpetuated.</Q> <Q>It was considered as the boundary day that divided the confines of winter and summer, allusively to which, there was instituted a sportful war between two parties; the one in defence of the continuance of winter, the other for bringing in the summer. The youth were divided into troops, the one in winter livery, the other in the gay habit of the spring. The mock battle was always fought booty, the spring was sure to obtain the victory, which they celebrated by carrying triumphally green branches with May flowers, proclaiming and singing the song of joy, of which the burthen was in these or equivalent terms.</Q></P>

<HEAD>MIDSUMMER.</HEAD>
<P>The ceremonies of the eve and day of Midsummer were various, and worthy attention. In all these festivals, it was the custom to keep the wake, as it was called, or watch, 'till after midnight, and to begin the sports and ceremonies of the day in the first hour of the morning.</P>
<P>The summer <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tice was the grand festival and jubilee of the Druids, and all those who retained any of the Amonian rites, of which we trace several in the religious ceremonies of the Saxons. This day was celebrated with peculiar magnificence and solemnity, when the adored luminary was at his greatest altitude. It has been alledged by some, that the Elusinian rites, in celebrating the return of Proserpine, gave part of the ceremony of this day; and that the use of garlands is derived from the custom of the initiated in the Elusinian misteries, being crowned with flowers.</P>
<P>It is usual to raise fires on the tops of high hills and in the villages, and sport and dance around them; this is of very remote antiquity, and the first cause lost in the distance of time. Many reasons have been assigned in different periods. Bourne quotes a passage of Durand to the following purport, <Q>In ancient times the dragons, being incited to lust through the heat of the season, did frequently as they flew through the air, spertmatize in the wells and fountains; by this means the water became infected, and the air pol∣luted, so that whoever drank the waters was either tormented with a grievous distemper, or lost his life. As soon as the physicians perceived this, they ordered fires to be made every where about the wells and fountains, and those things which occasioned the noisomest smell to be burnt, knowing that thereby the dragons would be driven away: and forasmuch as this cus∣tom was observed about the time we now celebrate St John Baptist's feast, it is therefore still observed among some people.</Q> In this enigmatical and misterious account we plainly trace, the fires were originally kindled for sacred rites and sacrifice, in order to avert the horrors of pestilence, which in early ages frequently attended the advancing heat of summer, in a country covered with forests and swamps, whose respiration and exhalations brought on various distempers, of which Epilepsies was one of the most general; to prevent which, the darkness of those times had received few discoveries of medi∣cine. In Scotland they used to run about the mountains and higher grounds with lighted torches, like the Sicilian women of old in scarch of Proserpine.— The prophetesses in Mona, at the approach of the Romans, ran about with dishevelled hair in a frantic mode with lighted torches, performing various rites to execrate the enemy. It was a custom not many years ago in this county, for the villagers to run with burning firebrands round their fields, and then in a forcible manner taking the ashes from some neighbouring fire, they used to exclaim, <HI>"We have won the flower (alias flour) of the wake."</HI> Moresin conceives we trace the ancient <HI>Cerealia</HI> in this ceremony. It is not
<PB N="16" REF="507"/>
to be wondered, that the Druid rites should in course of time be mixed with the Roman. Mr Borlace, speaking of this custom in Wales, says, <Q>He takes it to be the remains of the Druid superstition.</Q> Moresin is of opinion, the custom of leaping over the fires is a vestige of the ordeal, and those perform∣ing these feats were shewing tokens of innocence and virtue, by being neither burnt or sullied. The act of leaping through the flames was certainly a reli∣gious one, and was meant as a kind of purification, and not merely a sport and display of agility. Mr Pennant mentions another remarkable custom in Scotland, of which he was an eye witness: they take the new baptized infant, and wave it three or four times gently over a flame, saying thrice, <HI>"Let the fire consume thee now or never:"</HI> this seems to be the direct act of purification in passing the fire of Molock. Like other heathenish customs appropriated to festivals of the christian church, these are adopted on the day of St John, or rather used on the same anniversary, and the name of that Saint assumed to give them new sanctity. Mr Brand quotes several passages from <HI>Gebelin's Alle∣gories Orientales:</HI> <Q>Can one (says he) overlook here the St John fires, kindled about midnight, on the very moment of the solstice, by the greatest part both of ancient and modern nations? A religious ceremony, which goes backward thus to the most remote antiquity, and which was observed for the prosperity of States, and to dispel every kind of evil.</Q> Divinations were also used on the vigil of this day: <Q>Men and women were accustomed to gather together in the evening by the sea side, or in some certain houses, and there adorn a girl, who was her parent's first begotten child, after the manner of a bride. Then they feasted, and leaped after the manner of bac∣chanals, and danced and shouted as they were wont to do on their holidays; after this they poured into a narrow necked vessel, some of the sea water, and put also into it certain things belonging to each of them; then, as if the devil gifted the girl with the faculty of telling future things, they would enquire with a loud voice, about the good or evil fortune that should attend them; upon this the girl would take out of the vessel the first thing that came to hand, and shew it and give it to the owner, who, upon receiving it, was so foolish as to imagine himself wiser, as to the good or evil fortune that should attend him.</Q> Bourne, p. 226.</P>
<P>Another custom used on this day, is to dress out stools with a cushion of flowers. A lair of clay is placed on the stool, and therein is stuck, with great regularity, an arrangement of all kinds of flowers, so close as to form a beauti∣ful cushion: these are exhibited at the doors of houses in the villages, and at the ends of streets and cross lanes of larger towns, where the attendants beg money from passengers, to enable them to have an evening feast and dancing. This custom is evidently derived from the <HI>Ludi Compitalii</HI> of the Romans: this appellation was taken from the <HI>Compita</HI> or cross lanes, where they were in∣stituted and celebrated by the multitude assembled before the building of Rome. <HI>Servius Tullius</HI> revived this festival after it had been neglected for many years. It was the feast of the <HI>Lares</HI> or houshold Gods, who presided as
<PB N="17" REF="508"/>
well over houses as streets. This mode of adorning the seat or couch of the <HI>Lares</HI> was beautiful, and the idea of reposing them on aromatic flowers and beds of roses was excellent. The chief port of the ceremonies and solemnities of this feast used by the Romans, as we are told by the Poets and Historians, was exhibiting the houshold Gods, crowning and adorning them with chaplets and garlands of flowers, and offering sacrifices up and down the streets. The British remains of the ceremony are more refined—that of reposing them on those delicious beds. Suetonius tells us, that Augustus ordered the <HI>Lares</HI> to be crowned twice a year. We are not told there was any custom among the Romans, of strangers or passengers offering gifts. Our modern usage of all these old customs terminates in seeking to gain money for a merry night.</P>

<HEAD>MELL SUPPER.</HEAD>
<P>After harvest the Heathens are said to have sacrificed to the Deity Vacina or Vacuna, who was supposed to preside over Rest and Ease. It is now a custom on the last day of reaping, to dress up an image of the corn, and bear it home in triumph, which is called the Kern (properly Corn) Baby. In some places I have seen an image apparelled in great finery, crowned with flowers, a sheaf of corn placed under her arm, and a scycle in her hand, carried out of the village on the morning of the conclusive reaping day, with music and much clamour of the reapers into the field, where it stands fixed on a poll all day, and when the reaping is done, is brought home in like manner: This they call the <HI>Harvest Queen,</HI> and represents the Roman Ceres. The servants having performed the most valuable part of their labour, are entertained by their masters, when all distinction is laid aside. This feast is called the Mell-Supper, at which there are dancing, masquing, and disguising, and all other kinds of rural mirth. The name of this supper is derived from the rites of <HI>Ceres,</HI> when an offering of the first-fruits was made; the word <HI>Melle</HI> being a provincial word, and signifies in this country <HI>mingled;</HI> implying that the cakes used at this festival are mingled or made of new corn, and that it is the feast of the first mingling of flour of the new reaped wheat. The Romans held a solemn day after harvest, dedicated to Ceres and Ops, the accustomed victim a boar: but we cannot from any part of the above rural feast gather the least Roman remains, save only the season and the image of the Goddess. The re∣joicing after harvest may have an origin as high in antiquity as reaping itself: The first instance we read of is in the 4th chapter of Genesis, ver. 3, 4.</P>

<P>The 1st day of November seems to retain the celebration of a festival to Pomona, when it is supposed the summer stores are opened on the approach of winter.

I do not doubt but the Scotch fires kindled on this day, anciently burnt for this rural sacrifice.</P>

<P>Others, in the same kind of gay attire, draw about a Plough, called the Stot Plough, and when they receive a gift, make the exclamation, <HI>Largess!</HI> but if not requited at any house for their appearance, they draw the plough through the pavement, and raise the ground of the front in furrows. I have seen 20 men in the yoke of one plough.</P>
<P>These are perfect remains of Roman customs: Mr Brand quotes the follow∣ing passage, <Q>Aratrum inducere moris fuit Romanis, cum urbem aliquam evertissent, ut eam funditus delerent,</Q> Vocab. utriusque juris a Scot. J. C. in Verb. Aratrum. It may have been practised by the Romans in commemoration of the founding of Rome, or some cities in Britain.</P>

<HEAD>YULE CLOG.</HEAD>
<P>On the eve of the Nativity, the peasants place upon the fire a large piece of wood, called a Yule Clog; some have looked upon this as a rural sacrifice, the beast being stalled, there is no further use for the tether clog, by which he was prevented straying in the summer from his pasture. It has had a more distant implication, and intended to keep up the wake, and drive away malevolent spirits, and spirits of darkness. The Druids held a solemn festival at this time, and fires were lighted to fill up the space between the last night and first morn∣ing of the year, that the evil genius might not prevail. The Elusinian myste∣ries were typical of the renewing year; and the howlings and lamentations made in the hours of darkness for the loss of Adonis, were like our solemn wake over the yule clog, which was to banish the spirits of darkness whilst the sun was in his deepest recess. In those rites, the return of Adonis, or the sun, was represented by the approach of a Priest with a lighted torch, thereby dispelling the horrid darkness, in which the prevalency of the evil genius was described by horrid noises, and all the dreadful spectacles ingenuity could de∣vise, to secure the superstition of the assembly. Among all nations there has appeared a prevalent superstition touching good and evil spirits, one superin∣tending the hours of light, the others darkness; one the guides of man's recti∣tude and virtues, the other his malevolence and vice.</P>
<P>On the word Yule or Gule, there have been innumerable controversies with the learned, from whose arguments I am induced to believe it is a word de∣rived from the old British language, and implies a Festival; and thence that Yule Clog expresses the festive fuel.</P>

<HEAD>The DEAD.</HEAD>
<P>Customs attending Death and Funerals are well known, and their origin of no very distant antiquity; so that I will avoid a subject so peculiarly melan∣choly and affecting, save only the Arvel Dinner.</P>
<P>On the decease of any person possessed of valuable effects, the friends and neighbours of the family are invited to a dinner on the day of interment, which is called an Arthel or Arvel Dinner. Arthel is a British word, and is frequently more correctly written Arddelw. In Wales it is written Arddel, and signifies, according to Dr. Davise's Dictionary, <HI>Asserere,</HI> to avouch. This custom seems of very distant antiquity, and was a solemn festival made at the time of pub∣licly exposing the corps, to exculpate the heir, and those intitled to the pos∣sessions of the deceased, from fines and mulcts to the Lord of the Manor, and from all accusation of having used violence; so that the persons then convoked might avouch, that the person died fairly, and without suffering any personal injury. The Dead were thus exhibited by ancient nations, and perhaps the custom was introduced here by the Romans.</P>
