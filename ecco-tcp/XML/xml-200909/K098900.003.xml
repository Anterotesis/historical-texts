<HEAD>TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE <HI>WILLIAM Lord Cowper,</HI> Baron of <HI>WINGHAM.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My Lord,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AFTER having long ce∣lebrated the superiour Graces and Excellencies, among Men, in an Ima∣ginary Character, I do my self the
<PB N="iv" REF="3"/>
Honour to show my Veneration for transcendent Merit under my own Name, in this Address to your Lord∣ship. The just Application of those high Accomplishments of which you are Master, has been an Ad∣vantage to all your Fellow Subjects; and it is from the common Obli∣gation you have laid upon all the World, that I, though a private Man, can pretend to be affected with, or take the Liberty to ac∣knowledge your great Talents and publick Virtues.</P>
<P>It gives a pleasing Prospect to your Friends, that is to say, to the Friends of your Country, that you have passed through the Highest Offices, at an Age when others usually do but form to themselves the Hopes of them. They may expect to see you in the House of Lords as many Years as you were ascending to it. It is our common
<PB N="v" REF="4"/>
Good, that your admirable Elo∣quence can now no longer be employed but in the Expression of your own Sentiments and Judg∣ment. The skilful Pleader is now for ever chang'd into the just Judge; which latter Character your Lord∣ship exerts with so prevailing an Impartiality, that you win the Ap∣probation even of those who dissent from you, and you always obtain Favour, because you are never mo∣ved by it.</P>
<P>This gives you a certain Dignity peculiar to your present Situation, and makes the Equity, even of a Lord High Chancellor, appear but a Degree towards the Mag∣nanimity of a Peer of <HI>Great Bri∣tain.</HI></P>
<P>Forgive me, My Lord, when I cannot conceal from you, that I shall never hereafter behold you,
<PB N="vi" REF="5"/>
but I shall behold you, as lately, defending the Brave, and the Un∣fortunate.</P>
<P>When we attend to your Lord∣ship, engaged in a Discourse, we cannot but reflect upon the many Requisites which the vain-glorious Speakers of Antiquity have deman∣ded in a Man who is to excel in Oratory; I say, My Lord, when we reflect upon the Precepts by viewing the Example, though there is no Excellence proposed by those Rhetoricians wanting, the whole Art seems to be resolved into that one Motive of Speaking, Sincerity in the Intention. The graceful Manner, the apt Gesture, and the assumed Concern, are impotent Helps to Persuasion, in Compari∣son of the honest Countenance of him who utters what he really means. From hence it is, that all the Beauties which others at∣tain
<PB N="vii" REF="6"/>
with Labour, are in your Lord∣ship but the natural Effects of the Heart that dictates.</P>
<P>It is this noble Simplicity which makes you surpass Mankind in the Faculties, wherein Mankind are di∣stinguished from other Creatures, Reason and Speech.</P>
<P>If these Gifts were communi∣cated to all Men in Proportion to the Truth and Ardour of their Hearts, I should speak of you with the same Force as you express your self on any other Subject. But I resist my present Impulse, as agreeable as it is to me; though indeed, had I any Pretensions to a Fame of this Kind, I should, above all other Themes, attempt a Pane∣gyrick upon My Lord <HI>Cowper:</HI> For the only sure Way to a Reputation for Eloquence, in an Age where∣in that perfect Orator lives, is to
<PB N="viii" REF="7"/>
chuse an Argument, upon which he himself must of Necessity be silent. I am,</P>

<P>I Went on <HI>Friday</HI> last to the Opera, and was surprised to find a thin House at so noble an Entertainment, till I heard that the Tumbler was not to make his Appearance that Night. For my own Part, I was fully satisfied with the Sight of an Actor, who, by the Grace and Propriety of his Action and Gesture, does Honour to an hu∣mane Figure, as much as the other vilifies and degrades it. Every one will easily imagine I mean Signior <HI>Nicolini,</HI> who sets off the Character he bears in an Opera by his Action, as much as he does the Words of it by his Voice. Every Limb, and every Finger, contributes to the Part
<PB N="2" REF="9"/>
he acts, insomuch that a deaf Man might go a long with him in the Sense of it. There is scarce a beautiful Posture in an old Statue which he does not plant himself in, as the different Cir∣cumstances of the Story give Occasion for it. He performs the most ordinary Action in a Manner suitable to the Greatness of his Character, and shows the Prince even in the giving of a Letter, or the dispatching of a Message. Our best Actors are somewhat at a Loss to support themselves with proper Gesture, as they move from any con∣siderable Distance to the Front of the Stage; but I have seen the Person of whom I am now speak∣ing, eater alone at the remotest Part of it, and advance from it with such Greatness of Air and Meen, as seemed to fill the Stage, and at the same Time commanded the Attention of the Au∣dience with the Majesty of his Appearance. But notwithstanding the Dignity and Elegance of this Entertainment, I find for some Nights past, that <HI>Punchinello</HI> has robbed this Gentleman of the greater Part of his Female Spectators. The Truth of it is, I find it so very hard a Task to keep that Sex under any Manner of Government, that I have often resolved to give them over intirely, and leave them to their own Inventions. I was in Hopes that I had brought them to some Or∣der, and was employing my Thoughts on the Reformation of their Petticoats, when on a sud∣den I received Information from all Parts, that they run gadding after a Puppet-Show. I know very well, that what I here say, will be thought by some malicious Persons to flow from Envy to Mr. <HI>Powell;</HI> for which Reason, I shall set the late Dispute between us in a true Light. Mr. <HI>Powell</HI> and I had some Difference about Four Months ago, which we managed by way of Letter, as learned Men ought to do; and I was very well contented to bear such Sarcasms as he was pleased to throw upon me, and answered them with the
<PB N="3" REF="10"/>
same Freedom. In the midst of this our Misun∣derstanding and Correspondence, I happened to give the World an Account of the Order of <HI>Esquires;</HI> upon which, Mr. <HI>Powell</HI> was so disinge∣nuous, as to make one of his Puppets (I wish I know which of them it was) declare by way of Prologue, That one <HI>Isaac Bickerstaff,</HI> a Pretended <HI>Esquire,</HI> had wrote a scurrilous Piece to the Dis∣honour of that Rank of Men; and then, with more Art than Honesty, concluded, that all the <HI>Esquires</HI> in the Pit were abused by his Antago∣nist as much as he was. This publick Accusa∣tion made all the <HI>Esquires</HI> of that County, and several of other Parts, my professed Enemies. I do not in the least question, but that he will pro∣ceed in his Hostilities; and I am informed, That Part of his Design in coming up to Town, was to carry the War into my own Quarters. I do therefore solemnly declare, (notwithstanding that I am a great Lover of Art and Ingenuity) that if I hear he opens any of his People's Mouths a∣gainst me, I shall not fail to write a Critick up∣on his whole Performance; for I must confess, that I have naturally so strong a Desire of Praise, that I cannot bear Reproach, tho' from a Piece of Timber. As for <HI>Punch</HI> who takes all Opportu∣nities of bespattering me, I know very well his Original, and have been assured by the Joyner who put him together, that he was in long Dis∣pute with himself, whether he should turn him into several Pegs and Utensils, or make him the Man he is. The same Person confessed to me, that he had once actually laid aside his Head for a Nut-cracker. As for his Scolding Wife, (how∣ever she may value her self at present) it is very well known, that she is but a Piece of Crabtree. This Artificer further whispered in my Ear, that all his Courtiers and Nobles were taken out of a Quickset-Hedge not far from <HI>Islington;</HI> and that Dr. <HI>Faustus</HI> himself, who is now so great a Con∣jurer,
<PB N="4" REF="11"/>
is supposed to have learned his whole Art from an old Woman in that Neighbourhood, whom he long served in the Figure of a Broom∣staff.</P>
<P>But perhaps it may look trivial to insist so much upon Men's Persons; I shall therefore turn my Thoughts rather to examine their Behaviour, and consider, whether the several Parts are writ∣ten up to that Character which Mr. <HI>Powell</HI> piques himself upon, of an able and judicious Drama∣tist. I have for this Purpose provided my self with the Works of above Twenty <HI>French</HI> Criticks, and shall examine, (by the Rules which they have laid down upon the Art of the Stage) whe∣ther the Unity of Time, Place and Action, be rightly observed in any one of this celebrated Author's Productions; as also, whether in the Parts of his several Actors, and that of <HI>Punch</HI> in Particular, there is not sometimes an Impropriety of Sentiments, and an Impurity of Diction.</P>

<P>I came in here to Day at an Hour when only the Dead appear in Places of Resort and Gallan∣try, and saw hung up the Escutcheon of Sir <HI>Han∣nibal,</HI> a Gentleman who used to frequent this Place, and was taken up and interred by the Company of Upholders, as having been seen here at an unlicensed Hour. The Coat of the Deceased is, Three Bowls and a Jack in a green Field; the Crest, a Dice-Box, with the King of Clubs and Pam for Supporters. Some Days ago the Body was carried out of Town with great Pomp and Ceremony, in order to be buried with his Ancestors at the <HI>Peak.</HI> It is a Maxim in Mo∣rality, That we are to speak nothing but Truth of the Living, nothing but Good of the Dead. As I have carefully observed the first during his Life-time, I shall acquit my self as to the latter now he is deceased.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="12"/>
He was Knighted very young, not in the ordi∣nary Form, but by the common Consent of Man∣kind.</P>
<P>He was in his Person between round and square; in the Motion and Gesture of his Body he was unaffected and free, as not having too great a Respect for Superiors. He was in his Discourse bold and intrepid; and as every one has an Excellence as well as a Failing which di∣stinguishes him from other Men, Eloquence was his predominant Quality, which he had to so great a Perfection, that it was easier to him to speak than to hold his Tongue. This sometimes exposed him to the Derision of Men who had much less Parts than himself: And indeed his great Volubility and inimitable Manner of Speak∣ing, as well as the great Courage he shewed on those Occasions, did sometimes betray him into that Figure of Speech which is commonly distin∣guish'd by the Name of Gasconade. To men∣tion no other, he professed in this very Place some few Days before he died, That he would be One of the Six that would undertake to as∣sault me; for which Reason I have had his Figure upon my Wall till the Hour of his Death: And am resolved for the future to bury every one forthwith who I hear has an Intention to kill me.</P>
<P>Since I am upon the Subject of my Adversaries, I shall here publish a short Letter which I have received from a Well-wisher, and is as follows:</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Sage SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU cannot but know, there are many Scribblers and others who revile you and your Writings. It is wondered that you do not exert your self, and crush them at once. <HI>I am,</HI></P>

<P><PB N="6" REF="13"/>
In Answer to this, I shall act like my Prede∣cessor <HI>Aesop,</HI> and give him a Fable instead of a Reply.</P>
<P>It happened one Day, as a stout and honest Mastiff (that guarded the Village where he lived against Thieves and Robbers) was very gravely walking, with one of his Puppies by his Side, all the little Dogs in the Street gather'd about him, and barked at him. The little Puppy was so of∣fended at this Affront done to his Sire, that he asked him, Why he would not fall upon them, and tear them to Pieces? To which the Sire an∣swered, with a great Composure of Mind, <HI>If there were no Curs, I should be no Mastiff.</HI></P>

<P>THE Court being prepared for proceeding on the Cause of the Petticoat, I gave Orders to bring in a Criminal who was taken up as she went out of the Puppet-Show about Three Nights ago, and was now standing in the Street with a great Concourse of People about her. Word was brought me, that she had endeavoured twice or thrice to come in, but could not do it by reason of her Petticoat, which was too large for the Entrance of my House, tho' I had ordered both the Folding-Doors to be thrown open for its Re∣ception. Upon this, I desired the Jury of Ma∣trons, who stood at my Right Hand, to inform themselves of her Condition, and know whether
<PB N="7" REF="14"/>
there were any private Reasons why she might not make her Appearance separate from her Pet∣ticoat. This was managed with great Discretion, and had such an Effect, that upon the Return of the Verdict from the Bench of Matrons, I issued out an Order forthwith; That the Criminal should be stripped of her Incumbrances; till she became little enough to enter my House. I had before given Directions for an Engine of several Legs, that could contract or open it self like the Top of an Umbrello, in order to place the Pet∣ticoat upon it, by which Means I might take a leisurely Survey of it, as it should appear in its proper Dimensions. This was all done accord∣ingly; and forthwith, upon the closing of the Engine, the Petticoat was brought into Court. I then directed the Machine to be set upon the Table, and dilated in such a Manner as to show the Garment in its utmost Circumference; but my great Hall was too narrow for the Experi∣ment; for before it was half unfolded, it descri∣bed so immoderate a Circle, that the lower Part of it brush'd upon my Face as I sate in my Chair of Judicature. I then enquired for the Person that belonged to the Petticoat; and to my great Surprize, was directed to a very beautiful young Damsel, with so pretty a Face and Shape, that I bid her come out of the Crowd, and seated her upon a little Crock at my Left Hand. My pret∣ty Maid, said I, do you own your self to have been the Inhabitant of the Garment before us? The Girl I found had good Sense, and told me with a Smile, That notwithstanding it was her own Petticoat, she should be very glad to see an Example made of it; and that she wore it for no other Reason, but that she had a Mind to look as big and burly as other Persons of her Quality; That she had kept out of it as long as she could, and till she began to appear little in the Eyes of all her Acquaintance; That if she
<PB N="8" REF="15"/>
laid it aside, People would think she was not made like other Women. I always give great Allowances to the Fair Sex upon Account of the Fashion, and therefore was not displeased with the Defence of my pretty Criminal. I then or∣dered the Vest which stood before us to be drawn up by a Pully to the Top of my great Hall, and afterwards to be spread open by the Engine it was placed upon, in such a Manner, that it formed a very splendid and ample Canopy over our Heads, and covered the whole Court of Ju∣dicature with a kind of Silken Rotunda, in its Form not unlike the Cupolo of St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s. I enter'd upon the whole Cause with great Satis∣faction as I sate under the Shadow of it.</P>
<P>The Council for the Petticoat was now called in, and ordered to produce what they had to say against the popular Cry which was raised against it. They answered the Objections with great Strength and Solidity of Argument, and expatiated in very florid Harangues, which they did not fail to set off and furbelow (if I may be allowed the Metaphor) with many Periodical Sentences and Turns of Oratory. The chief Arguments for their Client were taken, first, from the great Be∣nefit that might arise to our Woollen Manufactu∣ry from this Invention, which was calculated as follows: The common Petticoat has not above Four Yards in the Circumference; whereas this over our Heads had more in the Semi-diameter; so that by allowing it Twenty four Yards in the Circumference, the Five Millions of Woollen Petticoats, which (according to Sir <HI>William Pet∣ty</HI>) supposing what ought to be supposed in a well∣governed State, that all Petticoats are made of that Stuff, would amount to Thirty Millions of those of the ancient Mode. A prodigious Im∣provement of the Woollen Trade! and what could not fail to fink the Power of <HI>France</HI> in a few Years.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="16"/>
To introduce the Second Argument, they beg∣ged Leave to read a Petition of the Rope-Makers, wherein it was represented, That the Demand for Cords, and the Price of them, were much risen since this Fashion came up. At this, all the Company who were present lifted up their Eyes into the Vault; and I must confess, we did disco∣ver many Traces of Cordage which were inter∣woven in the Stiffening of the Drapery.</P>
<P>A Third Argument was founded upon a Peti∣tion of the <HI>Greenland</HI> Trade, which likewise re∣presented the great Consumption of Whale-bone which would be occasioned by the present Fashion, and the Benefit which would thereby accrue to that Branch of the <HI>British</HI> Trade.</P>
<P>To conclude, they gently touched upon the Weight and Unweildiness of the Garment, which they insinuated might be of great Use to preserve the Honour of Families.</P>
<P>These Arguments would have wrought very much upon me, (as I then told the Company in a long and elaborate Discourse) had I not conside∣red the great and additional Expence which such Fashions would bring upon Fathers and Husbands; and therefore by no Means to be thought of till some Years after a Peace. I further urged, that it would be a Prejudice to the Ladies themselves, who could never expect to have any Money in the Pocket, if they laid out so much on the Petticoat. To this I added, the great Temptation it might give to Virgins, of acting in Security like mar∣ried Women, and by that Means give a Check to Matrimony, an Institution always encouraged by wise Societies.</P>
<P>At the same Time, in Answer to the several Petitions produced on that Side, I shewed one subscribed by the Women of several Persons of Quality, humbly setting forth, That since the In∣troduction of this Mode, their respective Ladies had (instead of bestowing on them their Cast-Gowns)
<PB N="10" REF="17"/>
cut them into Shreds, and mixed them with the Cordage and Buckram, to compleat the Stiffening of their Under-Petticoats. For which and sundry other Reasons, I pronounced the Pet∣ticoat a Forfeiture: But to shew that I did not make that Judgment for the Sake of filthy Lucre, I ordered it to be folded up, and sent it as a Pre∣sent to a Widow-Gentlewoman, who has five Daughters, desiring she would make each of them a Petticoat out of it, and send me back the Remainder, which I design to cut into Stoma∣chers, Caps, Facings of my Wastcoat-Sleeves, and other Garnitures suitable to my Age and Quality.</P>
<P>I would not be understood, that (while I discard this monstrous Invention) I am an Enemy to the proper Ornaments of the Fair Sex. On the con∣trary, as the Hand of Nature has poured on them such a Profusion of Charms and Graces, and sent them into the World more amiable and finished than the rest of her Works; so I would have them bestow upon themselves all the additional Beauties that Art can supply them with, provided it does not interfere with, disguise, or pervert, those of Nature.</P>
<P>I consider Woman as a beautiful Romantick Animal, that may be adorned with Furs and Fea∣thers, Pearls and Diamonds, Ores and Silks. The Lynx shall cast its Skin at her Feet to make her a Tippet; the Peacock, Parrat and Swan, shall pay Contributions to her Muff; the Sea shall be searched for Shells, and the Rocks for Gems; and every Part of Nature furnish out its Share towards the Embellishment of a Creature that is the most consummate Work of it. All this I shall indulge them in; but as for the Petti∣coat I have been speaking of, I neither can, nor will allow it.</P>

<P>WHen I look into the Frame and Consti∣tution of my own Mind, there is no Part of it which I observe with greater Satis∣faction, than that Tenderness and Concern which it bears for the Good and Happiness of Mankind. My own Circumstances are indeed so narrow and scanty, that I should tast but very little Plea∣sure, could I receive it only from those Enjoy∣ments which are in my own Possession; but by this great Tincture of Humanity, which I find in all my Thoughts and Reflections, I am happier than any single Person can be, with all the Wealth, Strength, Beauty, and Success, that can be conferred upon a Mortal, if he only relishes such a Proportion of these Blessings as is vested in himself, and is his own private Property. By this Means, every Man that does himself any real Service, does me a Kindness. I come in for my Share in all the Good that happens to a Man of Merit and Virtue, and partake of many Gifts of Fortune and Power that I was never born to. There is nothing in particular in which I so much rejoice, as the Deliverance of good and ge∣nerous Spirits out of Dangers, Difficulties, and Distresses. And because the World does not sup∣ply Instances of this Kind to furnish out sufficient Entertainments for such an Humanity and Bene∣volence of Temper, I have ever delighted in
<PB N="12" REF="19"/>
reading the History of Ages past, which draws together into a narrow Compass the great Oc∣currences and Events that are but thinly sown in those Tracts of Time which lie within our own-Knowledge and Observation. When I see the Life of a great Man, who has deserved well of his Country, after having struggled through all the Oppositions of Prejudice and Envy, break∣ing out with Lustre, and shining forth in all the Splendor of Success, I close my Book, and am an happy Man for a whole Evening.</P>
<P>But since in History, Events are of a mixed Nature, and often happen alike to the Worthless and the Deserving, insomuch that we frequently see a virtuous Man dying in the Midst of Disap∣pointments and Calamities, and the Vicious end∣ing their Days in Prosperity and Peace; I love to amuse my self with the Accounts I meet with in fabulous Histories and Factions: For in this Kind of Writings we have always the Pleasure of seeing Vice punished, and Virtue rewarded. In∣deed, were we able to view a Man in the whole Circle of his Existence, we should have the Sa∣tisfaction of seeing it close with Happiness or Misery, according to its proper Merit: But tho' our View of him is interrupted by Death before the finishing of his Adventures, (if I may so speak) we may be sure that the Conclusion and Catastrophe is altogether suitable to his Beha∣viour. On the contrary, the whole Being of a Man, consider'd as an Hero, or a Knight-Er∣rant, is comprehended within the Limits of a Poem or Romance, and therefore always ends to our Satisfaction; so that Inventions of this Kind are like Food and Exercise to a good-natured Dis∣position, which they please and gratifie at the same Time that they nourish and strengthen. The greater the Affliction is in which we see our Favourites in these Relations engaged, the greater is the Pleasure we take in seeing them relieved.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="20"/>
Among the many feigned Histories which I have met with in my Reading, there is none in which the Hero's Perplexity is greater, and the winding out of it more difficult, than that in a <HI>French</HI> Author whose Name I have forgot. It so happens, that the Hero's Mistress was the Sister of his most intimate Friend, who for certain Reasons was given out to be dead, while he was preparing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o leave his Country in Quest of Adventures. The Hero having heard of his Friend's Death, immediately repaired to his Mi∣stress, to condole with her, and comfort her. Upon his Arrival in her Garden, he discover'd at a Distance a Man clasped in her Arms, and em∣braced with the most endearing Tenderness. What should he do? It did not consist with the Gentleness of a Knight-Errant either to kill his Mistress, or the Man whom she was pleased to favour. At the same Time, it would have spoiled a Romance, should he have laid violent Hands on himself. In short, he immediately entered upon his Adventures; and after a long Series of Exploits, found out by Degrees, that the Person he saw in his Mistress's Arms was her own Bro∣ther, taking Leave of her before he left his Country, and the Embrace she gave him nothing else but the affectionate Farewel of a Sister: So that he had at once the Two greatest Satis∣factions that could enter into the Heart of Man, in finding his Friend alive, whom he thought dead; and his Mistress faithful, whom he had believed inconstant.</P>
<P>There are indeed some Disasters so very fatal, that it is impossible for any Accidents to rectifie them. Of this Kind was that of poor <HI>Lucretia;</HI> and yet we see <HI>Ovid</HI> has found an Expedient even in this Case. He describes a Beautiful and Royal Virgin walking on the Sea-shore, where she was discovered by <HI>Neptune,</HI> and violated after a long and unsuccessful Importunity. To miti∣gate
<PB N="14" REF="21"/>
her Sorrow, he offers her whatever she would wish for. Never certainly was the Wit of Woman more puzzled in finding out a Strata∣gem to retrieve her Honour. Had she desired to be changed into a Stock or Stone, a Beast, Fish or Fowl, she would have been a Loser by it: Or had she desired to have been made a Sea-Nymph, or a Goddess, her Immortality would but have perpetuated her Disgrace. Give me therefore, said she, such a Shape as may make me incapable of suffering again the like Calamity, or of being reproached for what I have already suffered. To be short, she was turned into a Man, and by that only Means avoided the Danger and Imputation she so much dreaded.</P>
<P>I was once my self in Agonies of Grief that are unutterable, and in so great a Distraction of Mind, that I thought my self even out of the Possibility of receiving Comfort. The Occasion was as fol∣lows: When I was a Youth in a Part of the Army which was then quartered at <HI>Dover,</HI> I fell in Love with an agreeable young Woman, of a good Fa∣mily in those Parts, and had the Satisfaction of seeing my Addresses kindly received, which occa∣sioned the Perplexity I am going to relate.</P>
<P>We were in a calm Evening diverting our selves upon the Top of the Cliff with the Prospect of the Sea, and trifling away the Time in such little Fond∣nesses as are most ridiculous to People in Business, and most agreeable to those in Love.</P>
<P>In the Midst of these our innocent Endearments, she snatched a Paper of Verses out of my Hand, and ran away with them. I was following her, when on a sudden the Ground, tho' at a conside∣rable Distance from the Verge of the Precipice, sunk under her, and threw her down from so pro∣digious an Height upon such a Range of Rocks, as would have dashed her into Ten Thousand Pieces, had her Body been made of Adamant.

upon such an Occasion, than for me to express it. I said to my self, It is not in the Power of Hea∣ven to relieve me! When I awaked, equally trans∣ported and astonished, to see my self drawn out of an Affliction which the very Moment before appeared to me altogether inextricable.</P>
<P>The Impressions of Grief and Horrour were so lively on this Occasion, that while they lasted, they made me more miserable than I was at the real Death of this beloved Person, (which happened a few Months after, at a Time when the Match be∣tween us was concluded) inasmuch as the imagi∣nary Death was untimely, and I my self in a Sort an Accessary; whereas her real Decease had at least these Alleviations, of being natural and in∣evitable.</P>
<P>The Memory of the Dream I have related still dwells so strongly upon me, that I can never read the Description of <HI>Dover-Cliff</HI> in <HI>Shakespear</HI>'s Tragedy of <HI>King Lear,</HI> without a fresh Sense of my Escape. The Prospect from that Place is drawn with such proper Incidents, that whoever can read it without growing giddy, must have a good Head, or a very bad One.</P>
<Q><L>Come on, Sir, here's the Place; stand still! How fearful</L>
<L>And dizzy 'tis to cast ones Eyes so low?</L>
<L>The Crows and Choughs that wing the Midway Air,</L>
<L>Show scarce as gross as Beetles. Half-Way down</L>
<L>Hangs one that gathers Samphire. Dreadful Trade!</L>
<L>Methinks he seems no bigger than his Head.</L>
<L>The Fishermen that walk upon the Beach,</L>
<L>Appear like Mice, and yond' tall anchoring Bark</L>
<L>Diminish'd to'her Boat; her Boat! a Buoy</L>
<L>Almost too small for Sight. The murmuring Surge</L>

<P>I Thought to have given over my Prosecution of the Dead for this Season, having by me many other Projects for the Reformation of Man∣kind; but I have receiv'd so many Complaints from such different Hands, that I shall disoblige Multitudes of my Correspondents, if I do not take Notice of them. Some of the Deceased, who I thought had been laid quietly in their Graves, are such Hobgoblins in publick Assem∣blies, that I must be forc'd to deal with them as <HI>Evander</HI> did with his triple-lived Adversary, who, according to <HI>Virgil,</HI> was forced to kill him thrice over before he could dispatch him.</P>
<Q><L>Ter Letho sternendus erat. —</L></Q>
<P>I am likewise informed, That several Wives of my Dead Men have, since the Decease of their Husbands, been seen in many publick Places without Mourning, or Regard to common De∣cency.</P>
<P>I am further advised, That several of the De∣funct, contrary to the Woollen Act, presume to dress themselves in Lace, Embroidery, Silks, Muslins, and other Ornaments forbidden to Per∣sons in their Condition. These and other the like Informations moving me thereunto, I must de∣sire, for Distinction-Sake, and to conclude this Subject for ever, that when any of these Posthu∣mous Persons appear, or are spoken of, that their
<PB N="17" REF="24"/>
Wives may be call'd Widows; their Houses, Se∣pulchres; their Chariots, Hearses; and their Gar∣ments, Flannel: On which Condition, they shall be allowed all the Conveniences that Dead Men can in Reason desire.</P>
<P>As I was writing this Morning on this Subject, I receiv'd the following Letter:</P>

<P>I Must confess I treated you very scurrilously when you first sent me hither; but you have dispatched such Multitudes after me to keep me in Countenance, that I am very well recon∣cil'd both to you and my Condition. We live very lovingly together; for as Death makes us all equal, it makes us very much delight in one another's Company. Our Time passes away much after the same Manner as it did when we were among you: Eating, Drinking, and Sleep∣ing, are our chief Diversions. Our <HI>Quid Nunes</HI> between Whiles go to a Coffee-house, where they have several warm Liquors made of the Waters of <HI>Lethe,</HI> with very good Poppy Tea. We that are the sprightly Genius's of the Place, refresh our selves frequently with a Bottle of Mum, and tell Stories till we fall asleep. You would do well to send among us Mr. <HI>Dodwill</HI>'s Book against the Immortality of the Soul, which would be of great Consolation to our whole Fraternity, who would be very glad to find that they are dead for good and all, and would in particular make me rest for ever,</P>

<P>I Have perused your <HI>Tatler</HI> of this Day, and have wept over it with great Pleasure: I wish you would be more frequent in your Fa∣mily-Pieces. For as I consider you under the Notion of a great Designer, I think these are not your least valuable Performances. I am glad to find you have given over your Face∣painting for some Time, because, I think, you have employed your self more in Grotesque Fi∣gures than in Beauties; for which Reason, I would rather see you work upon History-Pieces, that on single Portraicts. Your several Draughts of Dead Men appear to me as Pictures of Still-Life, and have done great Good in the Place where I live. The 'Squire of a neighbouring Village, who had been a long Time in the Number of Non-Entities, is entirely recovered by them. For these several Years past, there was not an Hare in the County that could be at Rest for him; and I think, the greatest Ex∣ploit he ever boasted of, was, That when he was High-Sheriff of the County, he hunted a Fox so far, that he could not follow him any further by the Laws of the Land. All the Hours he spent at Home, were in swelling him∣self with <HI>October,</HI> and rehearsing the Wonders he did in the Field. Upon reading your Papers,
<PB N="19" REF="26"/>
he has sold his Dogs, shook off his dead Com∣panions, looked into his Estate, got the Multi∣plication-Table by Heart, paid his Tythes, and intends to take upon him the Office of Church∣warden next Year. I wish the same Success with your other Patients, and am, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>

<HEAD>The humble Petition of <HI>Penelope Prim,</HI> Widow;</HEAD>
<OPENER>Sheweth,</OPENER>
<P>THat your Petitioner was bred a Clear-star∣cher and Sempstress, and for many Years worked to the <HI>Exchange;</HI> and to several Alder∣mens Wives, Lawyers Clerks, and Merchants-Apprentices.</P>
<P>That through the Scarcity caused by Regra∣ters of Bread-Corn, (of which Starch is made) and the Gentries immoderate frequenting the Opera's, the Ladies, to save Charges, have their Heads washed at Home, and the Beaus put out their Linen to common Landresses. So that your Petitioner hath little or no Work at her Trade: For Want of which she is re∣duced to such Necessity, That she and her Se∣ven Fatherless Children must inevitably perish, unless relieved by your Worship.</P>
<P>That your Petitioner is informed, That in Contempt of your Judgment pronounced on <HI>Tuesday</HI> the 3d Instant against the new-fashion∣ed Petticoat, or old-fashioned Fardingal, the Ladies design to go on in that Dress. And since it is presumed your Worship will not sup∣press them by Force, your Petitioner humbly
<PB N="20" REF="27"/>
desires you would order, That Ruffs may be added to the Dress; and that she may be heard by her Council, who has assured your Petitioner, he has such cogent Reasons to offer to your Court, that Ruffs and Fardingals are in∣separable; and that he questions not but Two Thirds of the greatest Beauties about Town will have Cambrick Collars on their Necks be∣fore the End of <HI>Easter</HI>-Term next. He further says, That the Design of our Great Grandmo∣thers in this Petticoat, was to appear much bigger than the Life; for which Reason, they had false Shoulder-Blades, like Wings, and the Ruff abovemention'd, to make their upper and lower Parts of their Bodies appear propor∣tionable; whereas the Figure of a Woman in the present Dress, bears (as he calls it) the Figure of a Cone, which (as he advises) is the same with that of an Extinguisher, with a little Knob at the upper End, and widening down∣ward, till it ends in a Basis of a most enormous Circumference.</P>
<P>Your Petitioner therefore most humbly prays, That you would restore the Ruff to the Far∣dingal, which in their Nature ought to be as inseparable as the Two <HI>Hungarian</HI> Twins.</P>
<CLOSER>And your Petitioner shall ever pray.</CLOSER>

</TEXT></Q>
<P>I have examined into the Allegations of this Petition, and find, by several ancient Pictures of my own Predecessors, particularly that of Dame <HI>Deborah Bickerstaff,</HI> my Great Grandmother, that the Ruff and Fardingal are made Use of as abso∣lutely necessary to preserve the Symmetry of the Figure; and Mrs. <HI>Pyramid Bickerstaff,</HI> her second Sister, is recorded in our Family-Book, with some Observations to her Disadvantage, as the first Fe∣male of our House that discovered, to any be∣sides her Nurse and her Husband, an Inch below her Chin or above her Instep. This convinces me
<PB N="21" REF="28"/>
of the Reasonableness of Mrs. <HI>Prim</HI>'s Demand; and therefore I shall not allow the reviving of any one Part of that ancient Mode, except the Whole is complied with. Mrs. <HI>Prim</HI> is there∣fore hereby impowered to carry Home Ruffs to such as she shall see in the abovementioned Pet∣ticoats, and require Payment on Demand.</P>

<P>I Have lately applied my self with much Sa∣tisfaction to the curious Discoveries that have been made by the Help of Microscopes, as they are related by Authors of our own and other Na∣tions. There is a great deal of Pleasure in pry∣ing into this World of Wonders, which Nature has laid out of Sight, and seems industrious to conceal from us. Philosophy had ranged over all the visible Creation, and began to want Objects for her Enquiries, when the present Age, by the Invention of Glasses, opened a new and inex∣haustible Magazine of Rarities, more wonderful and amazing than any of those which astonished our Forefathers. I was Yesterday amusing my self with Speculations of this Kind, and re∣flecting upon Myriads of Animals that swim in
<PB N="22" REF="29"/>
those little Seas of Juice that are contained in the several Vessels of an Humane Body. While my Mind was thus filled with that secret Wonder and Delight, I could not but look upon my self as in an Act of Devotion, and am very well pleased with the Thought of the great Heathen Anato∣mist, who calls his Description of the Parts of an Humane Body, <HI>An Hymn to the Supreme Be∣ing.</HI> The Reading of the Day produced in my Imagination an agreeable Morning's Dream, if I may call it such; for I am still in Doubt, whe∣ther it passed in my sleeping or waking Thoughts. However it was, I fancied that my good Genius stood at my Bed's Head, and entertained me with the following Discourse; for upon my Rising, it dwelt so strongly upon me, that I writ down the Substance of it, if not the very Words.</P>
<P>If (said he) you can be so transported with those Productions of Nature which are disco∣vered to you by those artificial Eyes that are the Works of Humane Invention, how great will your Surprize be, when you shall have it in your Power to model your own Eye as you please, and adapt it to the Bulk of Objects, which, with all these Helps, are by infinite Degrees too minute for your Perception. We who are unbodied Spi∣rits can sharpen our Sight to what Degree we think fit, and make the least Work of the Crea∣tion distinct and visible. This gives us such Idea's as cannot possibly enter into your present Con∣ceptions. There is not the least Particle of Mat∣ter which may not furnish one of us sufficient Employment for a whole Eternity. We can still divide it, and still open it, and still discover new Wonders of Providence, as we look into the dif∣ferent Texture of its Parts, and meet with Beds of vegetables, Mineral and Metallick Mixtures, and several Kinds of Animals that lie hid, and as it were lost in such an endless Fund of Mat∣ter. I find you are surprized at this Discourse;
<PB N="23" REF="30"/>
but as your Reason tells you there are infinite Parts in the smallest Portion of Matter, it will likewise convince you, that there is as great a Variety of Secrets, and as much Room for Dis∣coveries, in a Particle no bigger than the Point of a Pin, as in the Globe of the whole Earth. Your Microscopes bring to Sight Shoals of living Creatures in a Spoonful of Vinegar; but we who can distinguish them in their different Magni∣tudes, see among them several huge <HI>Leviathans</HI> that terrify the little Fry of Animals about them, and take their Pastime as in an Ocean, or the great Deep. I could not but smile at this Part of his Relation, and told him, I doubted not but he could give me the History of several Invisible Giants, accompanied with their respective Dwarfs, in case that any of these little Beings are of an humane Shape. You may assure your self (said he) that we see in these little Animals different Natures, Instincts and Modes of Life, which cor∣respond to what you observe in Creatures of bigger Dimensions. We descry Millions of Spe∣cies subsisted on a green Leaf, which your Glas∣ses represent only in Crowds and Swarms. What appears to your Eye but as Hair or Down rising on the Surface of it, we find to be Woods and Forrests, inhabited by Beasts of Prey, that are as dreadful in those their little Haunts, as Lyons and Tygers in the Deserts of <HI>Libya.</HI> I was much de∣lighted with his Discourse, and could not forbear telling him, That I should be wonderfully pleased to see a natural History of Imperceptibles, con∣taining a true Account of such Vegetables and Animals as grow and live out of Sight. Such Disquisitions (answered he) are very suitable to reasonable Creatures; and you may be sure, there are many curious Spirits amongst us who employ themselves in such Amusements. For as our Hands, and all our Senses, may be formed to what Degree of Strength and Delicacy we
<PB N="24" REF="31"/>
please, in the same Manner as our Sight, we can make what Experiments we are inclin'd to, how small soever the Matter be in which we make them. I have been present at the Dissection of a Mite, and have seen the Skeleton of a Flea. I have been shown a Forrest of numberless Trees, which has been pick'd out of an Acorn. Your Microscope can show you in it a compleat Oak in Miniature; and could you suit all your Organs as we do, you might pluck an Acorn from this lit∣tle Oak, which contains another Tree; and so proceed from Tree to Tree, as long as you would think fit to continue your Disquisitions. It is al∣most impossible (added he) to talk of Things so remote from common Life, and the ordinary No∣tions which Mankind receive from blunt and gross Organs of Sense, without appearing extra∣vagant and ridiculous. You have often seen a Dog open'd, to observe the Circulation of the Blood, or make any other useful Enquiry; and yet would be tempted to laugh if I should tell you, that a Circle of much greater Philosophers than any of the Royal Society, were present at the cutting up of one of those little Animals which we find in the Blue of a Plumb: That it was ty'd down alive before them; and that they observed the Palpitations of the Heart, the Course of the Blood, the Working of the Muscles, and the Convulsions in the several Limbs, with great Accuracy and Improvement. I must confess, said I, for my own Part, I go along with you in all your Discoveries with great Pleasure; but it is certain, they are too fine for the Gross of Mankind, who are more struck with the De∣scription of every Thing that is great and bulky. Accordingly we find the best Judge of humane Nature setting forth his Wisdom, not in the For∣mation of these minute Animals, (tho' indeed no less wonderful than the other) but in that of the <HI>Leviathan</HI> and <HI>Behemoth,</HI> the <HI>Horse</HI> and the
<PB N="25" REF="32"/>
<HI>Crocodile.</HI> Your Observation (said he) is very just; and I must acknowledge for my own Part, that although it is with much Delight that I see the Traces of Providence in these Instances, I still take greater Pleasure in considering the Works of the Creation in their Immensity, than in their Mi∣nuteness. For this Reason, I rejoice when I strengthen my Sight so as to make it pierce into the most remote Spaces, and take a View of those Heavenly Bodies which lie out of the Reach of Humane Eyes, though assisted by Telescopes. What you look upon as one confused White in the Milky-Way, appears to me a long Tract of Heavens, distinguish'd by Stars that are ranged in proper Figures and Constellations. While you are admiring the Sky in a Starry Night, I am en∣tertained with a Variety of Worlds and Suns pla∣ced one above another, and rising up to such an immense Distance, that no created Eye can see an End of them.</P>
<P>The latter Part of his Discourse flung me in∣to such an Astonishment, that he had been silent for some Time before I took Notice of it; when on a sudden I started up and drew my Curtains, to look if any one was near me, but saw no Body, and cannot tell to this Moment whether it was my good Genius or a Dream that left me.</P>

<P>INstead of considering any particular Passion o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Character in any one Set of Men, my Thought<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> were last Night employed on the Contemplatio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of Humane Life in general; and truly it appear<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to me, that the whole Species are hurried on by the same Desires, and engaged in the same Pur∣suits, according to the different Stages and Divi¦sions of Life. Youth is devoted to Lust, middl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Age to Ambition, old Age to Avarice. Thes<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> are the Three general Motives and Principles o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Action both in good and bad Men; though i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> must be acknowledged, that they change thei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Names, and refine their Natures, according t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Temper of the Person whom they direct an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> animate. For with the Good, Lust becomes Vir¦tuous Love; Ambition, True Honour; and Ava¦rice, the Care of Posterity. This Scheme o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Thought amused me very agreeably till I retire<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to Rest; and afterwards formed it self into <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> pleasing and regular Vision, which I shall describ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in all its Circumstances, as the Objects presente<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> themselves, whether in a serious or ridiculou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Manner.</P>
<P>I dreamed that I was in a Wood, of so prodi¦gious an Extent, and cut into such a Variety o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Walks and Allies, that all Mankind were lost an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> bewildered in it. After having wandered up an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="27" REF="34"/>
down some Time, I came into the Centre of it, which opened into a wide Plain, that was filled with Multitudes of both Sexes. I here discovered Three great Roads, very wide and long, that led into Three different Parts of the Forrest. On a sudden, the whole Multitude broke into Three Parts, according to their different Ages, and mar∣ched in their respective Bodies into the Three great Roads that lay before them. As I had a Mind to know how each of these Roads termi∣nated, and whether it would lead those who pas∣sed through them, I joined my self with the As∣sembly that were in the Flower and Vigour of their Age, and called themselves, <HI>The Band of Lovers.</HI> I found to my great Surprise, that seve∣ral old Men besides my self had intruded into this agreeable Company; as I had before ob∣served, there were some young Men who had united themselves to the Band of Misers, and were walking up the Path of Avarice; tho' both made a very ridiculous Figure, and were as much laughed at by those they joined, as by those they forsook. The Walk which we marched up, for Thickness of Shades, Embroidery of Flowers, and Melody of Birds, with the distant Purling of Streams, and Falls of Water, was so wonderfully delightful, that it charmed our Senses, and in∣toxicated our Minds with Pleasure. We had not been long here, before every Man singled out some Woman to whom he offered his Addresses, and professed himself a Lover; when on a sud∣den we perceived this delicious Walk to grow more narrow as we advanced in it, till it ended in many intricate Thickets, Mazes and Laby∣rinths, that were so mixed with Roses and Bram∣bles, Brakes of Thorns, and Beds of Flowers, rocky Paths and pleasing Grotto's, that it was hard to say, whether it gave greater Delight or Perplexity to those who travelled in it.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="35"/>
It was here that the Lovers began to be eager in their Pursuits. Some of their Mistresses, who only seemed to retire for the Sake of Form and Decency, led them into Plantations that were dis∣posed into regular Walks; where, after they had wheeled about in some Turns and Windings, they suffered themselves to be overtaken, and gave their Hands to those who pursued them. O∣thers withdrew from their Followers into little Wildernesses, where there were so many Paths interwoven with each other in so much Confusion and Irregularity, that several of the Lovers quit∣ted the Pursuit, or broke their Hearts in the Chace. It was sometimes very odd to see a Man pursuing a fine Woman that was following ano∣ther, whose Eye was fixed upon a Fourth, that had her own Game in View in some other Quar∣ter of the Wilderness. I could not but observe Two Things in this Place which I thought very particular, That several Persons who stood only at the End of the Avenues, and cast a careless Eye upon the Nymphs during their whole Flight, often catched them, when those who pressed them the most warmly through all their Turns and Doubles, were wholly unsuccessful: And that some of my own Age, who were at first look'd upon with Aversion and Contempt, by being well acquainted with the Wilderness, and by dodging their Women in the particular Corners and Allies of it, catched them in their Arms, and took them from those whom they really loved and admired. There was a particular Grove, which was called, <HI>The Labyrinth of Coquets;</HI> where many were en∣ticed to the Chase, but few returned with Pur∣chase. It was pleasant enough to see a celebra∣ted Beauty, by smiling upon one, casting a Glance upon another, beckoning to a third, and adapt∣ing her Charms and Graces to the several Follies of those that admired her, drawing into the La∣byrinth a whole Pack of Lovers, that lost them∣selves
<PB N="29" REF="36"/>
in the Maze, and never could find their Way out of it. However, it was some Satis∣faction to me, to see many of the Fair Ones who had thus deluded their Followers, and left them among the Intricacies of the Labyrinth, obliged when they came out of it, to surrender to the first Partner that offer'd himself. I now had crossed over all the difficult and perplexed Passages that seemed to bound our Walk, when on the other Side of them, I saw the same great Road running on a little Way, till it was terminated by two beautiful Temples. I stood here for some Time, and saw most of the Multitude who had been dis∣persed amongst the Thickets, coming out Two by Two, and marching up in Parts towards the Tem∣ples that stood before us. The Structure on the Right Hand was (as I afterwards found) conse∣crated to Virtuous Love, and could not be entered but by such as received a Ring, or some other Token, from a Person who was placed as a Guard at the Gate of it. He wore a Garland of Roses and Myrtles on his Head, and on his Shoul∣ders a Robe like an Imperial Mantle, white and unspotted all over, excepting only, that where it was clasped at his Breast, there were Two golden Turtle-Doves that buttoned it by their Bills, which were wrought in Rubies. He was called by the Name of <HI>Hymen,</HI> and was seated near the En∣trance of the Temple, in a delicious Bower, made up of several Trees, that were embraced by Woodbines, Jessamines, and Amaranths, which were as so many Emblems of Marriage, and Or∣naments to the Trunks that supported them. As I was single and unaccompanied, I was not per∣mitted to enter the Temple, and for that Reason am a Stranger to all the Mysteries that were per∣formed in it. I had however the Curiosity to ob∣serve how the several Couples that entered were disposed of; which was after the following Man∣ner. There were two great Gates on the Back∣side
<PB N="30" REF="37"/>
of the Edifice, at which the whole Crowd was let out. At one of these Gates were Two Women, extremely beautiful, tho' in a different Kind, the one having a very careful and compo∣sed Air, the other a Sort of Smile and ineffable Sweetness in her Countenance. The Name of the first was <HI>Discretion,</HI> and of the other <HI>Compla∣cency.</HI> All who came out of this Gate, and put themselves under the Direction of these two Si∣sters, were immediately conducted by them into Gardens, Groves, and Meadows, which abounded in Delights, and were furnished with every Thing that could make them the proper Seats of Happi∣ness. The Second Gate of this Temple let out all the Couples that were unhappily married, who came out linked together by Chains, which each of them strove to break, but could not. Several of these were such as had never been acquainted with each other before they met in the great Walk, or had been too well acquainted in the Thicket. The Entrance to this Gate was posses∣sed by three Sisters, who joined themselves with these Wretches, and occasioned most of their Mi∣series. The youngest of the Sisters was known by the Name of <HI>Levity,</HI> who with the Innocence of a Virgin, had the Dress and Behaviour of a Harlot. The Name of the Second was <HI>Contention,</HI> who bore on her Right Arm a Muff made of the Skin of a Porcupine; and on her Left carried a little Lap-Dog, that barked and snapped at every one that passed by her.</P>
<P>The eldest of the Sisters, who seemed to have an haughty and imperious Air, was always ac∣companied with a tawny <HI>Cupid,</HI> who generally marched before her with a little Mace on his Shoulder, the End of which was fashioned into the Horns of a Stag. Her Garments were yel∣low, and her Complexion pale. Her Eyes were piercing, but had odd Casts in them, and that particular Distemper, which makes Persons who
<PB N="31" REF="38"/>
are troubled with it, see Objects double. Upon Enquiry, I was informed that her Name was <HI>Jealousy.</HI></P>
<P>Having finished my Observations upon this Temple, and its Votaries, I repaired to that which stood on the Left Hand, and was called, <HI>The Tem∣ple of Lust.</HI> The Front of it was raised on <HI>Corin∣thian</HI> Pillars, with all the meretricious Orna∣ments that accompany that Order; whereas that of the other was composed of the chast and ma∣tron-like <HI>Ionic.</HI> The Sides of it were adorned with several grotesque Figures of Goats, Spar∣rows, Heathen Gods, Satyrs, and Monsters made up of half Man half Beast. The Gates were un∣guarded, and open to all that had a Mind to en∣ter. Upon my going in, I found the Windows were blinded, and let in only a Kind of Twilight, that served to discover a prodigious Number of dark Corners and Apartments, into which the whole Temple was divided. I was here stunned with a mixed Noise of Clamour and Jollity: On one Side of me, I heard Singing and Dancing; on the other, Brawls and Clashing of Swords. In short, I was so little pleased with the Place, that I was going out of it; but found I could not return by the Gate where I entered, which was barred against all that were come in, with Bolts of Iron, and Locks of Adamant. There was no going back from this Temple through the Paths of Plea∣sure which led to it: All who passed thro' the Ce∣remonies of the Place, went out at an Iron Wicket, which was kept by a dreadful Giant called <HI>Remorse,</HI> that held a Scourge of Scorpions in his Hand, and drove them into the only Outlet from that Tem∣ple. This was a Passage, so rugged, so uneven, and choaked with so many Thorns and Briars, that it was a melancholy Spectacle to behold the Pains and Difficulties which both Sexes suffered who walked through it. The Men, tho' in the Prime of their Youth, appeared weak and infee∣bled
<PB N="32" REF="39"/>
with old Age: The Women rung their Hands, and tore their Hair; and several lost their Limbs before they could extricate themselves out of the Perplexities of the Path in which they were engaged. The remaining Part of this Vi∣sion, and the Adventures I met with in the Two great Roads of Ambition and Avarice, must be the Subject of another Paper.</P>

<P>I Was recollecting the Remainder of my Vision, when my Maid came to me, and told me, there was a Gentlewoman below who seemed to be in great Trouble, and pressed very much to see me. When it lay in my Power to remove the Distress of an unhappy Person, I thought I should very ill employ my Time in attending Matters of Speculation, and therefore desired the Lady would walk in. When she entered, I saw her Eyes full of Tears. However, her Grief was not so great as to make her omit Rules; for she was very long and exact in her Civilities, which gave me Time to view and consider her. Her Clothes were very rich, but tarnish'd; and her Words very fine, but illapplied. These Distinctions made me with∣out Hesitation (tho' I had never seen her before) ask'd her, If her Lady had any Commands for me? She then began to weep afresh, and with many broken Sighs told me, That their Family was in very great Affliction—I beseeched her to com∣pose her self, for that I might possibly be capable of assisting them—She then cast her Eye upon my little Dog, and was again transported with too much Passion to proceed; but with much ado, she at last gave me to understand, That <HI>Cupid,</HI> her Lady's Lap-dog, was dangerously ill, and in so bad a Condition, that her Lady neither saw Company, nor went abroad, for which Rea∣son
<PB N="34" REF="41"/>
she did not come her self to consult me; that as I had mentioned with great Affection my own Dog, (here she courtsied, and looking first at the Cur, and then on me, said, indeed I had Reason, for he was very pretty) her Lady sent to me ra∣ther than to any other Doctor, and hoped I would not laugh at her Sorrow, but send her my Ad∣vice. I must confess, I had some Indignation to find my self treated like something below a Far∣rier; yet well knowing, that the best, as well as most tender Way, of dealing with a Woman, is to fall in with her Humours, and by that Means to let her see the Absurdity of them. I proceed∣ed accordingly: Pray, Madam, said I, can you give me any methodical Account of this Illness, and how <HI>Cupid</HI> was first taken? Sir (said she) we have a little ignorant Country Girl who is kept to tend him: She was recommended to our Fa∣mily by one, that my Lady never saw but once, at a Visit; and you know, Persons of Quality are always inclined to Strangers; for I could have helped her to a Cousin of my own, but—Good Madam (said I) you neglect the Account of the sick Body, while you are complaining of this Girl. No, no, Sir (said she), begging your Par∣don: But it is the general Fault of Physicians, they are so in Haste, that they never hear out the Case. I say, this silly Girl, after washing <HI>Cupid,</HI> let him stand half an Hour in the Window with∣out his Collar, where he catched cold, and in an Hour after began to bark very hoarse. He had however a pretty good Night, and we hoped the Danger was over; but for these Two Nights last past, neither he nor my Lady have slept a Wink. Has he (said I) taken any Thing? No (said she), but my Lady says, he shall take any Thing that you prescribe, provided you do not make Use of Jesuits Powder, or the Cold Bath. Poor <HI>Cupid</HI> (continued she) has always been Phtisical, and as he lies under something like a Chin-Cough, we
<PB N="35" REF="42"/>
are afraid it will end in a Consumption. I then asked her, if she had brought any of his Water to show me. Upon this, she stared me in the Face, and said, I am afraid, Mr. <HI>Bickerstaff,</HI> you are not serious; but if you have any Receipt that is proper on this Occasion, pray let us have it; for my Mistress is not to be comforted. Upon this, I pansed a little without returning any An∣swer, and after some short Silence, I proceeded in the following Manner: I have considered the Nature of the Distemper, and the Constitution of the Patient, and by the best Observation that I can make on both, I think it is safest to put him into a Course of Kitchin Physick. In the mean time, to remove his Hoarseness, it will be the most natural Way to make <HI>Cupid</HI> his own Drug∣gist; for which Reason, I shall prescribe to him, Three Mornings successively, as much Powder as will lie on a Groat, of that noble Remedy which the Apothecaries call <HI>Album Graecum.</HI> Upon hear∣ing this Advice, the young Woman smiled, as if she knew how ridiculous an Errand she had been employed in; and indeed I found by the Sequel of her Discourse, That she was an arch Baggage, and of a Character that is frequent enough in Persons of her Employment, who are so used to conform themselves in every Thing to the Hu∣mours and Passions of their Mistresses, that they sacrifice Superiority of Sense to Superiority of Condition, and are insensibly betrayed into the Passions and Prejudices of those whom they serve, without giving themselves Leave to consider, that they are extravagant and ridiculous. However I thought it very natural, when her Eyes were thus open, to see her give a new Turn to her Discourse, and from sympathizing with her Mi∣stress in her Follies, to fall a Railing at her. You cannot imagine, said she, Mr. <HI>Bickerstaff,</HI> what a Life she makes us lead for the Sake of this lit∣tle ugly Cur: If he dies, we are the most unhap∣py
<PB N="36" REF="43"/>
Family in Town. She chanced to lose a Par∣rat last Year, which, to tell you truly, brought me into her Service; for she turned off her Wo∣man upon it, who had lived with her Ten Years, because she neglected to give him Water, tho' every one of the Family says, she was as innocent of the Bird's Death, as the Babe that is unborn. Nay, she told me this very Morning, That if <HI>Cupid</HI> should die, she would send the poor inno∣cent Wench I was telling you of, to <HI>Bridewell,</HI> and have the Milk-Woman tried for her Life at the <HI>Old-Baily,</HI> for putting Water into his Milk. In short, she talks like any distracted Creature.</P>
<P>Since it is so, young Woman (said I), I will by no Means let you offend her, by staying on this Message longer than is absolutely necessary, and so forced her out.</P>
<P>While I am studying to cure those Evils and Distresses that are necessary or natural to Humane Life, I find my Task growing upon me, since by these accidental Cares, and acquired Calamities, (if I may so call them) my Patients contract Di∣stempers to which their Constitution is of it self a Stranger. But this is an Evil I have for many Years remarked in the Fair Sex; and as they are by Nature very much formed for Affection and Dal∣liance, I have observed, That when by too obstinate a Cruelty, or any other Means, they have disap∣pointed themselves of the proper Objects of Love, as Husbands, or Children, such Virgins have ex∣actly at such a Year grown fond of Lap-dogs, Parrats, or other Animals. I know at this Time a celebrated Toast, whom I allow to be one of the most agreeable of her Sex, that in the Pre∣sence of her Admirers, will give a Torrent of Kisses to her Cat, any one of which a Christian would be glad of. I do not at the same Time deny, but there are as great Enormities of this Kind committed by our Sex as theirs. A <HI>Roman</HI> Emperor had so very great an Esteem for an Horse
<PB N="37" REF="44"/>
of his, that he had Thoughts of making him a Consul; and several Moderns of that Rank of Men whom we call Country Squires, won't scru∣ple to kiss their Hounds before all the World, and declare in the Presence of their Wives, that they had rather salute a Favourite of the Pack, than the finest Woman in <HI>England.</HI> These vo∣luntary Friendships between Animals of different Species, seem to arise from Instinct; for which Reason, I have always looked upon the mutual good Will between the 'Squire and the Hound, to be of the same Nature with that between the Lion and the Jackall.</P>
<P>The only Extravagance of this Kind which ap∣pears to me excusable, is one that grew out of an Excess of Gratitude, which I have somewhere met with in the Life of a <HI>Turkish</HI> Emperor. His Horse had brought him safe out of a Field of Battle, and from the Pursuit of a victorious Ene∣my. As a Reward for such his good and faithful Service, his Master built him a Stable of Marble, shod him with Gold, fed him in an Ivory Man∣ger, and made him a Rack of Silver. He an∣nex'd to the Stable several Fields and Meadows, Lakes, and running Streams. At the same time he provided for him a Seraglio of Mares, the most beautiful that could be found in the whole <HI>Ottoman</HI> Empire. To these were added a suita∣ble Train of Domesticks, consisting of Grooms, Farriers, Rubbers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> accommodated with pro∣per Liveries and Pensions. In short, nothing was omitted that could contribute to the Ease and Happiness of his Life who had preserved the Em∣peror's.</P>

<P>I Find it is thought necessary, that I (who have taken upon me to censure the Irregularities of the Age) should give an Account of my own Actions when they appear doubtful, or subject to Misconstruction. My appearing at the Play on <HI>Monday</HI> last, is looked upon as a Step in my Con∣duct, which I ought to explain, that others may not be misled by my Example. It is true in Mat∣ter of Fact, I was present at the ingenious Enter∣tainment of that Day, and placed my self in a Box which was prepared for me with great Civi∣lity and Distinction. It is said of <HI>Virgil,</HI> when he entered a <HI>Roman</HI> Theatre, where there were many Thousands of Spectators present, That the whole Assembly rose up to do him Honour; a Respect which was never before paid to any but the Emperor. I must confess, That universal Clap, and other Testimonies of Applause, with which I was received at my first Appearance in the Theatre of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> gave me as sensible a Delight, as the above-mentioned Reception could give to that Immortal Poet. I should be ungrateful at the same Time, if I did not take this Opportunity of acknowledging the great Ci∣vilities that were shown me by Mr. <HI>Thomas Dog∣get,</HI> who made his Compliments to me between the Acts, after a most ingenuous and discreet Manner; and at the same Time communicated to me, that the Company of Upholders desired to receive me at their Door at the End of the <HI>Har∣market,</HI>
<PB N="39" REF="46"/>
and to light me home to my Lodgings. That Part of the Ceremony I forbad, and took particular Care during the whole Play to observe the Conduct of the <HI>Drama,</HI> and give no Offence by my own Behaviour. Here I think it will not be foreign to my Character, to lay down the pro∣per duties of an Audience, and what is incum∣bent upon each individual Spectator in publick Diversions of this Nature. Every one should on these Occasions show his Attention, Understand∣ing and Virtue. I would undertake to find out all the Persons of Sense and Breeding by the Ef∣fect of a single Sentence, and to distinguish a Gen∣tleman as much by his Laugh, as his Bow. When we see the Footman and his Lord diverted by the same Jest, it very much turns to the Dimi∣nution of the one, or the Honour of the other. But tho' a Man's Quality may appear in his Un∣derstanding and Tast, the Regard to Virtue ought to be the same in all Ranks and Conditions of Men, however they make a Profession of it un∣der the Name of Honour, Religion, or Morali∣ty. When therefore we see any Thing divert an Audience, either in Traged or Comedy, that strikes at the Duties of Civil Life, or exposes what the best Men in all Ages have looked up∣on as sacred and inviolable, it is the certain Sign of a prosligate Race of Men, who are fallen from the Virtue of their Forefathers, and will be contemptible in the Eyes of their Posterity. For this Reason I took great Delight in seeing the generous and disinterested Passion of the Lovers in this Comedy (which stood so many Trials, and was proved by such a Variety of diverting Incidents) received with an universal Approba∣tion. This brings to my Mind a Passage in <HI>Ci∣cero,</HI> which I could never read without being in Love with the Virtue of a <HI>Roman</HI> Audience. He there describes the Shouts and Applauses which the People gave to the Persons who acted the
<PB N="40" REF="47"/>
Parts of <HI>Pilades</HI> and <HI>Orestes,</HI> in the noblest Oc∣easion that a Poet could invent to show Friend∣ship in Perfection. One of them had forfeited his Life by an Action which he had committed; and as they stood in Judgment before the Ty∣rant, each of them strove who should be the Criminal, that he might save the Life of his Friend. Amidst the Vehemence of each asserting himself to be the Offender, the <HI>Roman</HI> Au∣dience gave a Thunder of Applause, and by that Means, as the Author hints, approved in others what they would have done themselves on the like Occasion. Methinks, a People of so much Virtue were deservedly placed at the Head of Mankind: But alas! Pleasures of this Nature are not frequently to be met with on the <HI>English</HI> Stage.</P>
<P>The <HI>Athenians,</HI> at a Time when they were the most polite, as well as the most powerful, Go∣vernment in the World, made the Care of the Stage one of the chief Parts of the Administra∣tion: And I must confess, I am astonished at the Spirit of Virtue which appeared in that Peo∣ple upon some Expressions in a Scene of a fa∣mous Tragedy; an Account of which we have in one of <HI>Seneca</HI>'s Epistles. A coverous Person is represented speaking the common Sentiments of all who are possessed with that Vice in the following Soliloquy, which I have translated literally.</P>
<Q>Let me be called a base Man, so I am called a rich one. If a Man is rich, who asks if he is good? The Question is. How much we have; not from whence, or by what Means, we have it. Every one has so much Merit as he has Wealth. For my own Part, let me be rich, Oh ye Gods! or let me die. The Man dies happily, who dies increasing his Trea∣sure. There is more Pleasure in the Possession of
<PB N="41" REF="48"/>
Wealth, than in that of Parents, Children, Wife, or Friends.</Q>
<P>The Audience were very much provoked by the first Words of this Speech; but when the Actor came to the Close of it, they could bear no longer. In short, the whole Assembly rose up at once in the greatest Fury, with a Design to pluck him off the Stage, and brand the Work it self with Infamy. In the Midst of the Tumult, the Author came out from behind the Scenes, begging the Audience to be composed for a little while, and they should see the Tragical End which this Wretch should come to immediately. The Promise of Punishment appeased the People, who sat with great Attention and Pleasure to see an Example made of so odious a Criminal. It is with shame and Concern that I speak it; but I very much question, whether it is possible to make a Speech so impious, as to raise such a lau∣dable Horror and Indignation in a Modern Au∣dience. It is very natural for an Author to make Ostentation of his Reading, as it is for an old Man to tell Stories; for which Reason I must beg the Reader will excuse me, if I for once in∣dulge my self in both these Inclinations. We see the Attention, Judgment and Virtue of a whole Audience, in the foregoing Instances. If we would imitate the Behaviour of a single Specta∣tor, let us reflect upon that of <HI>Socrates,</HI> in a Par∣ticular which gives me as great an Idea of that extraordinary Man, as any Circumstance of his Life; or what is more, of his Death. This ve∣nerable Person often frequented the Theatre, which brought a great many thither, out of a Desire to see him. On which Occasion it is re∣corded of him, That he sometimes stood to make himself the more conspicuous, and to satis∣fy the Curiosity of the Beholders. He was one Day present at the first Representation of a Tra∣gedy
<PB N="42" REF="49"/>
of <HI>Euripides,</HI> who was his intimate Friend, and whom he is said to have assisted in several of his Plays. In the Midst of the Tragedy, which had met with very great Success, there chanc'd to be a Line that seemed to encourage Vice and Immorality.</P>
<P>This was no sooner spoken, but <HI>Socrates</HI> rose from his Seat, and without any Regard to his Affection for his Friend, or to the Success of the Play, showed himself displeased at what was said, and walked out of the Assembly. I que∣stion not but the Reader will be curious to know what the Line was that gave this Divine Hea∣then so much Offence. If my Memory fails me not, it was in the Part of <HI>Hippolitus,</HI> who when he is pressed by an Oath, which he had taken to keep Silence, returned for Answer, That he had taken the Oath with his Tongue, but not with his Heart. Had a Person of a vicious Character made such a Speech, it might have been allowed as a proper Representation of the Baseness of his Thoughts: But such an Expres∣sion out of the Mouth of the virtuous <HI>Hippolitus,</HI> was giving a Sanction to Falshood, and establish∣ing Perjury by a Maxim.</P>
<P>Having got over all Interruptions, I have set apart to Morrow for the closing of my Vision.</P>

<HEAD>A Continuation of the Vision.</HEAD>
<P>WITH much Labour and Difficulty I pas∣sed through the first Part of my Vision, and recovered the Centre of the Wood, from whence I had the Prospect of the Three great Roads. I here joined my self to the middle-aged Party of Mankind, who marched behind the Standard of Ambition. The great Road lay in a direct Line, and was terminated by the <HI>Temple of Virtue.</HI> It was planted on each Side with Lawrels, which were intermixed with Marble Trophies, Carved Pillars, and Statues of Law∣givers, Heroes, Statesmen, Philosophers, and Poets. The Persons who travelled up this great Path, were such whose Thoughts were bent upon doing eminent Services to Mankind, or promoting the Good of their Country. On each Side of this great Road were several Paths, that were also laid out in straight Lines, and ran parallel with it. These were most of them covered Walks, and received into them Men of retired Virtue, who proposed to themselves the same End of their Journey, tho' they chose to make it in Shade and Obscurity. The Edifices at the Extremity of the Walk were so contrived, that we could not see the <HI>Temple of Honour</HI> by reason of the <HI>Temple of Virtue,</HI> which stood before it.
<PB N="44" REF="51"/>
At the Gates of this Temple we were met b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Goddess of it, who conducted us into tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>of Honour,</HI> which was joined to the other Edi¦fice by a beautiful Triumphal Arch, and had no other Entrance into it. When the Deity of the Inner Structure had received us, she presented us in a Body to a Figure that was placed over the high Altar, and was the Emblem of Eternity. She sat on a Globe in the midst of a Golden Zodiac, holding the Figure of a Sun in one Hand, and a Moon in the other. Her Head was veiled, and her Feet covered. Our Hearts glowed within us as we stood amidst the Sphere of Light which this Image cast on every Side of it.</P>
<P>Having seen all that happen'd to this Band of Adventurers, I repaired to another Pile of Build∣ing that stood within View of the <HI>Temple of Honour,</HI> and was raised in Imitation of it, upon the very same Model; but at my Approach to it, I found, that the Stones were laid together without Mortar, and that the whole Fabrick stood upon so weak a Foundation, that it shook with every Wind that blew. This was called the <HI>Temple of Vanity.</HI> The Goddess of it sat in the midst of a great many Tapers, that burned Day and Night, and made her appear much bet∣ter than she would have done in open Day-light. Her whole Art, was to show her self more beau∣tiful and majestick than she really was. For which Reason, she had painted her Face, and wore a Cluster of false Jewels upon her Breast: But what I more particularly observed, was, the Breadth of her Petticoat, which was made alto∣gether in the Fashion of a modern Fardingal. This Place was filled with Hypocrites, Pedants, Free-Thinkers, and prating Politicians; with a Rabble of those who have only Titles to make them great Men. Female Votaries crowded the Temple, choak'd up the Avenues of it, and
<PB N="45" REF="52"/>
were more in Number than the Sand upon the Sea-shore. I made it my Business in my Return towards that Part of the Wood from whence I first set out, to observe the Walks which led to this Temple; for I met in it several who had be∣gun their Journey with the Band of virtuous Persons, and travelled some Time in their Com∣pany: But upon Examination I found, that there were several Paths which led out of the great Road into the Sides of the Wood, and ran into so many crooked Turns and Windings, that those who travelled thro' them often turned their Backs upon the <HI>Temple of Virtue,</HI> then crossed the straight Road, and sometimes marched in it for a little Space, till the crooked Path which they were engaged in again led them into the Wood. The several Alleys of these Wanderers had their particular Ornaments: One of them I could not but take Notice of, in the Walk of the mischie∣vous Pretenders to Politicks, which had at every Turn the Figure of a Person, whom by the Inscription I found to be <HI>Machiavel,</HI> pointing out the Way with an extended Finger like a <HI>Mercury.</HI></P>
<P>I was now returned in the same Manner as be∣fore, with a Design to observe carefully every Thing that passed in the Region of <HI>Avarice,</HI> and the Occurrences in that Assembly, which was made up of Persons of my own Age. This Body of Travellers had not gone far in the Third great Road, before it led them insensibly into a deep Valley, in which they journied several Days with great Toil and Uneasiness, and with∣out the necessary Refreshments of Food and Sleep. The only Relief they met with, was in a River that ran through the Bottom of the Valley on a Bed of Golden Sand: They often drank of this Stream, which had such a particular Quality in it, that tho' it refreshed them for a Time, it
<PB N="46" REF="53"/>
rather inflamed than quenched their Thirst. On each Side of the River was a Range of Hills full of precious Ore; for where the Rains had wash'd off the Earth, one might see in several Parts of them long Viens of Gold, and Rocks that looked like pure Silver. We were told, That the Deity of the Place had forbad any of his Votaries to dig into the Bowels of these Hills, or convert the Treasures they contained to any Use, under Pain of Starving. At the End of the Valley stood <HI>The Temple of Avarice,</HI> made after the Manner of a Fortification, and surrounded with a thou∣sand tripple-headed Dogs, that were placed there to keep off Beggars. At our Approach they all fell a Barking, and would have very much ter∣rified us, had not an old Woman who had called her self by the forged Name of <HI>Competency</HI> of∣fered her self for our Guide. She carrried under her Garment a Golden Bow, which she no soon∣er held up in her Hand, but the Dogs lay down, and the Gates flew open for our Reception. We were led through an Hundred Iron Doors, before we entered the Temple. At the upper End of it sat the God of <HI>Avarice,</HI> with a long filthy Beard, and a meagre starved Countenance, enclosed with Heaps of Ingots, and Pyramids of Money, but half naked and shivering with Cold. On his Right Hand was a Fiend called <HI>Rapine,</HI> and on his Left a particular Favourite to whom he had given the Title of <HI>Parsimony.</HI> The First was his Collector, and the other his Cashier.</P>
<P>There were several long Tables placed on each Side of the Temple, with respective Officers at∣tending behind them. Some of these I enquired into. At the first Table was kept the Office of <HI>Corruption.</HI> Seeing a Solicitor extremely busy, and whispering every Body that passed by, I kept my Eye upon him very attentively, and saw him often going up to a Person that had a Pen in his Hand, with a Multiplication Table and an Al∣manack
<PB N="47" REF="54"/>
before him, which as I afterwards heard, was all the Learning he was Master of. The Soli∣citor would often apply himself to his Ear, and at the same Time convey Money into his Hand, for which the other would give him out a Piece of Paper or Parchment, signed and sealed in Form. The Name of this dextrous and successful Soli∣citor was <HI>Bribery.</HI> At the next Table was the Office of <HI>Extortion.</HI> Behind it sate a Person in a Bob-Wig, counting over a great Sum of Money. He gave out little Purses to several, who after a short Tour brought him, in Return, Sacks full of the same Kind of Coin. I saw at the same Time a Person called <HI>Fraud,</HI> who sate behind a Counter with false Scales, light Weights, and scanty Measures; by the skilful Application of which Instruments, she had got together an im∣mense Heap of Wealth. It would be endless to name the several Officers, or describe the Vora∣ries that attended in this Temple. There were many old Men panting and breathless, reposing their Heads on Bags of Money; nay many of them actually dying, whose very Pangs and Con∣vulsions (which rendered their Purses useless to them) only made them grasp 'em the faster. There were some tearing with one Hand all Things, even to the Garments and Flesh of ma∣ny miserable Persons who stood before them, and with the other Hand, throwing away what they had seized, to Harlots, Flatterers, and Pan∣ders, that stood behind them.</P>
<P>On a sudden the whole Assembly fell a trem∣bling, and upon Enquiry, I found, that the great Room we were in was haunted with a Spectre, that many Times a Day appeared to them, and terrified them to Distraction.</P>
<P>In the midst of their Terror and Amazement, the Apparition entered, which I immediate∣ly knew to be <HI>Poverty.</HI> Whether it were by my Acquaintance with this Phantom, which
<PB N="48" REF="55"/>
had render'd the Sight of her more familiar to me, or however it was, she did not make so indi∣gent or frightful a Figure in my Eye as the God of this loathsome Temple. The miserable Vota∣ries of this Place were, I found, of another Mind. Every one fancied himself threatned by the Apparition as she stalked about the Room, and began to lock their Coffers, and tie their Bags, with the utmost Fear and Trembling.</P>
<P>I must confess, I look upon the Passion which I saw in this unhappy People to be of the same Nature with those unaccountable Antipathies which some Persons are born with, or rather as a kind of Phrensy, not unlike that which throws a Man into Terrors and Agonies at the Sight of so useful and innocent a Thing as Water. The whole Assembly was surprised, when, instead of paying my Devotions to the Deity whom they all adored, they saw me address my self to the Phantom.</P>
<Q>Oh <HI>Poverty!</HI> (said I) my first Petition to thee is, That thou wouldst never appear to me hereafter; but if thou wilt not grant me this, that thou wouldst not bear a Form more terrible than that in which thou appearest to me at pre∣sent. Let not thy Threats and Menaces betray me to any Thing that is ungrateful or unjust. Let me not shut my Ears to the Cries of the Needy. Let me not forget the Person that has deserved well of me. Let me not, for any Fear of thee, desert my Friend, my Principles, or my Honour. If Wealth is to visit me, and to come with her usual Attendants, <HI>Vanity</HI> and <HI>Avarice,</HI> do thou, Oh <HI>Poverty!</HI> hasten to my Rescue; but bring along with thee the two Sisters, in whose Company thou art always chearful, <HI>Li∣berty</HI> and <HI>Innocence.</HI></Q>

<OPENER><DATELINE>From my own Apartment, <DATE>January 23.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Went on <HI>Saturday</HI> last to make a Visit in the City; and as I passed through <HI>Cheapside,</HI> I saw Crowds of People turning down towards the <HI>Bank,</HI> and struggling who should first get their Money into the new-erected Lottery. It gave me a great Notion of the Credit of our present Go∣vernment and Administration, to find People press as eagerly to pay Money, as they would to re∣ceive it; and at the same Time a due Respect for that Body of Men who have found out so plea∣sing an Expedient for carrying on the Common Cause, that they have turned a Tax into a Diver∣sion. The Chearfulness of Spirit, and the Hopes of Success, which this Project has occasioned in this great City, lightens the Burden of the War, and puts me in Mind of some Games which they say were invented by wise Men who were Lovers of their Country, to make their Fellow-Citizens undergo the Tediousness and Fatigues of a long Siege. I think there is a Kind of Homage due to Fortune, (if I may call it so) and that I should be wanting to my self if I did not lay in my Pre∣tences to her Favour, and pay my Compliments to her by Recommending a Ticket to her Dispo∣sal. For this Reason, upon my Return to my Lodgings, I sold off a Couple of Globes and a Telescope, which, with the Cash I had by me,
<PB N="50" REF="57"/>
raised the Sum that was requisite for that Purpose. I find by my Calculations, that it is but an Hun∣dred and Fifty Thousand to One against my be∣ing worth a Thousand Pounds <HI>per Annum</HI> for Thirty two Years; and if any Plumb in the City will lay me an Hundred and Fifty Thousand Pounds to Twenty Shillings (which is an even Bett) that I am not this fortunate Man, I will take the Wager, and shall look upon him as a Man of singular Courage and Fair-dealing, having given Orders to Mr. <HI>Morphew</HI> to subscribe such a Policy in my Behalf, if any Person accepts of the Offer. I must confess, I have had such private Intimations from the Twinkling of a certain Star in some of my Astronomical Observations, that I should be unwilling to take Fifty Pounds a Year for my Chance, unless it were to oblige a parti∣cular Friend. My chief Business at present is, to prepare my Mind for this Change of Fortune: For as <HI>Seneca,</HI> who was a greater Moralist, and a much richer Man than I shall be with this Addi∣tion to my present Income, says, <HI>Munera ista For∣tune putatis? Insidiae sunt. What we look upon as Gifts and Presents of Fortune, are Traps and Snares which she lays for the Unwary.</HI> I am arming my self against her Favours with all my Philosophy; and that I may not lose my self in such a Re∣dundance of unnecessary and superfluous Wealth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> I have determined to settle an Annual Pension ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of it upon a Family of <HI>Palatines,</HI> and by tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Means give these unhappy Strangers a Tast o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>British</HI> Property.

Quality. It was impossible for me to make an Inspection into my own Fortune on this Occasion, without seeing at the same Time the Fate of o∣thers who are embarked in the same Adventure. And indeed it was a great Pleasure to me to ob∣serve, That the War, which generally impove∣rishes those who furnish out the Expence of it, will by this Means give Estates to some, without making others the poorer for it. I have lately seen several in Liveries, who will give as good of their own very suddenly; and took a particular Satisfaction in the Sight of a young Country Wench, whom I this Morning passed by as she was whirling her Mop, with her Petticoats tucked up very agreeably, who, if there is any Truth in my Art, is within Ten Months of being the hand∣somest great Fortune in Town. I must confess, I was so struck with the Foresight of what she is to be, that I treated her accordingly, and said to her, Pray, young Lady, permit me to pass by. I would for this Reason advise all Masters and Mistresses to carry it with great Moderation and Condescention towards their Servants till next <HI>Michaelmas,</HI> lest the Superiority at that Time should be inverted. I must likewise admonish all my Brethren and Fellow-Adventurers, to fill their Minds with proper Arguments for their Support and Consolation in case of ill Success. It so hap∣pens in this Particular, that though the Gainers will have Reason to rejoice, the Losers will have no Reason to complain. I remember, the Day after the Thousand Pound Prize was drawn in the Penny Lottery, I went to visit a splenatick Ac∣quaintance of mine, who was under much De∣jection, and seemed to me to have suffered some great Disappointment. Upon Enquiry, I found he had put Two-pence for himself and his Son into the Lottery, and that neither of them had drawn the Thousand Pound. Hereupon this un∣lucky Person took Occasion to enumerate the
<PB N="52" REF="59"/>
Misfortunes of his Life, and concluded with tel∣ling me, That he never was successful in any of his Undertakings. I was forced to comfort him with the common Reflection upon such Occasions, That Men of the greatest Merit are not always Men of the greatest Success, and that Persons of his Character must not expect to be as happy as Fools. I shall proceed in the like Manner with my Rivals and Competitors for the Thousand Pounds a Year which we are now in Pursuit of; and that I may give general Content to the whole Body of Candidates, I shall allow all that draw Prizes to be fortunate, and all that miss them to be wise.</P>
<P>I must not here omit to acknowledge, that I have received several Letters upon this Subject, but find one common Error running through them all, which is, That the Writers of them be∣lieve their Fate in these Cases depends upon the Astrologer, and not upon the Stars, as in the fol∣lowing Letter from one, who, I fear, flatters him∣self with Hopes of Success, which are altogether groundless, since he does not seem to me so great a Fool as he takes himself to be.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>COming to Town, and finding my Friend Mr. <HI>Partridge</HI> dead and buried, and you the only Conjurer in Repute, I am under a Ne∣cessity of applying my self to you for a Favour, which nevertheless I confess it would better be∣come a Friend to ask, than one who is, as I am, altogether a Stranger to you; but Poverty, you know, is impudent; and as that gives me the Occasion, so that alone could give me the Con∣fidence to be thus importunate.</P>
<P>I am, Sir, very poor, and very desirous to be otherwise: I have got Ten Pounds, which I de∣sign to venture in the Lottery now on foot. What I desire of you is, that by your Art, you will
<PB N="53" REF="60"/>
choose such a Ticket for me as shall arise a Bene∣fit sufficient to maintain me. I must beg Leave to inform you, That I am good for nothing, and must therefore insist upon a larger Lot than would satisfy those who are capable by their own Abilities of adding something to what you should assign 'em; whereas I must expect an absolute, independant Maintenance, because, as I said, I can do nothing. 'Tis possible, after this free Confession of mine, you may think I don't deserve to be rich; but I hope you'll like∣wise observe, I can ill afford to be poor. My own Opinion is, I am well qualified for an Estate, and have a good Title to Luck in a Lot∣tery; but I resign my self wholly to your Mercy, not without Hopes that you will consi∣der, the less I deserve, the greater the Generosity in you. If you reject me, I have agreed with an Acquaintance of mine to bury me for my Ten Pounds. I once more recommend my self to your Favour, and bid you <HI>Adieu.</HI></P>

<P>THere is a Sect of ancient Philosophers, who, I think, have left more Volumes behind them, and those better written, than any other of the Fraternities in Philosophy. It was a Maxim of this Sect, That all those who do not live up to the Principles of Reason and Virtue, are Madmen. Every one, who governs himself by these Rules, is allowed the Title of Wise, and reputed to be in his Senses; and every one in Proportion, as he deviates from them, is pronounced Frantick and Distracted. <HI>Cicero</HI> having chosen this Maxim for his Theme, takes Occasion to argue from it very agreeably with <HI>Clodius,</HI> his implacable Adversary, who had procured his Banishment. A City (says he) is an Assembly distinguished into Bodies of Men, who are in Possession of their respective Rights and Privileges, cast under proper Subor∣dinations, and in all its Parts obedient to the Rules of Law and Equity. He then represents the Government from whence he was banished, at a Time when the Consul, Senate, and Laws, had lost their Authority, as a Commonwealth of Lu∣naricks. For this Reason, he regards his Expul∣sion from <HI>Rome,</HI> as a Man would being turned out of <HI>Bedlam,</HI> if the Inhabitants of it should drive
<PB N="55" REF="62"/>
him out of their Walls as a Person unfit for their Community. We are therefore to look upon every Man's Brain to be touched, however he may appear in the general Conduct of his Life, if he has an unjustifiable Singularity in any Part of his Conversation or Behaviour: Or if he swerves from right Reason, however common his Kind of Madness may be, we shall not excuse him for its being epidemical, it being our present Design to clap up all such as have the Marks of Madness upon them, who are now permitted to go about the Streets, for no other Reason, but because they do no Mischief in their Fits. Abundance of ima∣ginary great Men are put in Straw to bring them to a right Sense of themselves: And is it not al∣together as reasonable, that an insignificant Man, who has an immoderate Opinion of his Merits, and a quite different Notion of his own Abilities from what the rest of the World entertain, should have the same Care taken of him, as a Beggar who fancies himself a Duke or a Prince? Or, Why should a Man, who starves in the Midst of Plenty, be trusted with himself, more than he who fancies he is an Emperor in the Midst of Poverty? I have several Women of Quality in my Thoughts, who set so exorbitant a Value upon themselves, that I have often most heartily pitied them, and wished them, for their Recovery, under the same Discipline with the Pewterer's Wife. I find by several Hints in ancient Authors, that when the <HI>Romans</HI> were in the Height of Power and Luxu∣ry, they assigned out of their vast Dominions an Island called <HI>Anticyra,</HI> as an Habitation for Mad∣men. This was the Bedlam of the <HI>Roman</HI> Em∣pire, whither all Persons who had lost their Wits used to resort from all Parts of the World in Quest of them. Several of the <HI>Roman</HI> Emperors were advised to repair to this Island; but most of them, instead of listening to such sober Counsels, gave Way to their Distraction, till the People
<PB N="56" REF="63"/>
knocked them in the Head as despairing of their Cure. In short, it was as usual for Men of distem∣pered Brains to take a Voyage to <HI>Anticyra</HI> in those Days, as it is in ours for Persons who have a Dis∣order in their Lungs to go to <HI>Montpellier.</HI></P>
<P>The prodigious Crops of Hellebore with which this whole Island abounded, did not only furnish them with incomparable Tea, Snuff, and <HI>Hungary</HI> Water, but impregnated the Air of the Country with such sober and salutiferous Steams, as very much comforted the Heads, and refreshed the Sen∣ses, of all that breathed in it. A discarded States∣man, that at his first Landing appeared stark sta∣ring mad, would become calm in a Week's Time; and upon his Return Home, live easy and satisfied in his Retirement. A moaping Lover would grow a pleasant Fellow by that Time he had rid thrice about the Island; and a hair-brained Rake, after a short Stay in the Country, go Home again a composed, grave, worthy Gentleman.</P>
<P>I have premised these Particulars before I enter on the main Design of this Paper, because I would not be thought altogether notional in what I have to say, and pass only for a Projector in Morality. I could quote <HI>Horace,</HI> and <HI>Seneca,</HI> and some other ancient Writers of good Repute, upon the same Occasion, and make out by their Testimony, that our Streets are filled with distracted Persons; that our Shops and Taverns, private and publick Hou∣ses, swarm with them; and that it is very hard to make up a tolerable Assembly without a Majo∣rity of them. But what I have already said, is, I hope, sufficient to justify the ensuing Project, which I shall therefore give some Account of without any further Preface.<LIST>
<ITEM>1. It is humbly proposed, That a proper Recep∣tacle or Habitation be forthwith erected for all such Persons as, upon due Trial and Examination, shall appear to be out of their Wits.</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="57" REF="64"/>
2. That to serve the present Exigency, the Col∣lege in <HI>Moor-Fields</HI> be very much extended at both Ends; and that it be converted into a Square, by adding three other Sides to it.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. That no Body be admitted into these Three additional Sides, but such whose Phrensy can lay no Claim to an Apartment in that Row of Build∣ing which is already erected.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. That the Architect, Physician, Apothecary, Surgeon, Keepers, Nurses, and Porters, be all and each of them crack'd, provided that their Phrensy does not lie in the Profession or Employment to which they shall severally and respectively be as∣signed. <P>N.B. <HI>It is thought fit to give the foregoing Notice, that none may present himself here for any Post of Honour or Profit who is not duly qualified.</HI></P></ITEM>
<ITEM>5. That over all the Gates of the additional Buildings, there be Figures placed in the same Manner as over the Entrance of the Edifice already erected; provided, they represent such Distracti∣ons only as are proper for those additional Build∣ings; as, of an envious Man gnawing his own Flesh, a Gamester pulling himself by the Ears, and knocking his Head against a Marble Pillar, a covetous Man warming himself over a Heap of Gold, a Coward flying from his own Shadow, and the like.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>Having laid down this general Scheme of my Design, I do hereby invite all Persons who are willing to encourage so publick-spirited a Project, to bring in their Contributions as soon as possible, and to apprehend forthwith any Politician whom they shall catch raving in a Coffee-house, or any Free-thinker whom they shall find publishing his Deliriums, or any other Person who shall give the like manifest Signs of a crazed Imagination: And I do at the same Time give this publick Notice
<PB N="58" REF="65"/>
to all the Madmen about this great City, That they may return to their Senses with all imagi∣nable Expedition, lest if they should come into my Hands, I should put them into a Regimen which they would not like: for if I find any one of them persist in his frantick Behaviour, I will make him in a Month's Time as famous as ever <HI>Oliver</HI>'s Porter was.</P>

<P>THere is no Sort of Company so agreeable as that of Women who have good Sense with∣out Affectation, and can converse with Men without any private Design of imposing Chains and Fet∣ters. <HI>Belvidera,</HI> whom I visited this Evening, is one of these. There is an invincible Prejudice in Favour of all she says, from her being a beau∣tiful. Woman, because she does not consider her self as such when she talks to you. This amiable Temper gives a certain Tincture to all her Dis∣course, and made it very agreeable to me, till we were interrupted by <HI>Lydia,</HI> a Creature who has all the Charms that can adorn a Woman. Her Attractions would indeed be irresistible, but that she thinks them so, and is always employing them in Stratagems and Conquests. When I turned my Eye upon her as she sat down, I saw she was a Person of that Character, which, for the further Information of my Country Correspon∣dents, I had long wanted an Opportunity of ex∣plaining. <HI>Lydia</HI> is a finished <HI>Coquet;</HI> which is a
<PB N="59" REF="66"/>
Sect among Women of all others the most mis∣chievous, and makes the greatest Havock and Disorder in Society. I went on in the Dis∣course I was in with <HI>Belvidera,</HI> without showing that I had observed any Thing extraordinary in <HI>Lydia:</HI> Upon which, I immediately saw her look me over as some very ill-bred Fellow; and casting a scornful Glance on my Dress, give a Shrug at <HI>Belvidera.</HI> But as much as she despised me, she wanted my Admiration, and made Twenty Of∣fers to bring my Eyes her Way: But I reduced her to a Restlesness in her Seat, and impertinent playing of her Fan, and many other Motions and Gestures, before I took the least Notice of her. At last I looked at her with a Kind of Surprize, as if she had before been unobserved by reason of an ill Light where she sar. It is not to be expressed what a sudden Joy I saw rise in her Countenance, even at the Approbation of such a very old Fellow: But she did not long enjoy her Triumph without a Rival; for there imme∣diately entred <HI>Castabella,</HI> a Lady of a quite con∣trary Character, that is to say, as eminent a <HI>Prude</HI> as <HI>Lydia</HI> is a <HI>Coquet. Belvidera</HI> gave me a Glance, which methought intimated, that they were both Curiosities in their Kind, and worth remarking. As soon as we were again seated, I stole Looks at each Lady, as if I was comparing their Perfe∣ctions. <HI>Belvidera</HI> observed it, and began to lead me into a Discourse of them both to their Faces, which is to be done easily enough; for one Wo∣man is generally so intent upon the Faults of another, that she has not Reflection enough to observe when her own are represented. I have taken Notice, Mr. <HI>Bickerstaff</HI> (said <HI>Belvidera</HI>), that you have in some Parts of your Writings drawn Characters of our Sex, in which you have not, to my Apprehension, been clear enough and di∣stinct, particularly in those of a <HI>Prude</HI> and a <HI>Coquet.</HI> Upon the Mention of this, <HI>Lydia</HI> was rouzed with
<PB N="60" REF="67"/>
the Expectation of seeing <HI>Castabella</HI>'s Picture, and <HI>Castabella</HI> with the Hopes of that of <HI>Lydia.</HI> Madam (said I to <HI>Belvidera</HI>), when we consider Nature, we shall often find very contrary Effects flow from the same Cause. The <HI>Prude</HI> and <HI>Coquet</HI> (as different as they appear in their Behaviour) are in Reality the same Kind of Women: The Motive of Action in both is the Affectation of pleasing Men. They are Sisters of the same Blood and Constitution, only one chuses a grave, the other a light, Dress. The <HI>Prude</HI> appears more virtuous, the <HI>Coquet</HI> more vicious, than she really is. The distant Behaviour of the <HI>Prude,</HI> tends to the same Purpose as the Advances of the <HI>Coquet;</HI> and you have as little Reason to fall into Despair from the Severity of the one, as to con∣ceive Hope from the Familiarity of the latter. What leads you into a clear Sense of their Cha∣racter is, That you may observe each of them has the Distinction of Sex in all her Thoughts, Words and Actions. You can never mention any Assembly you were lately in, but one asks you with a rigid, the other with a sprightly Air, Pray what Men were there? As for <HI>Prudes,</HI> it must be confessed, that there are several of them, who, like Hypocrites, by long Practice of a false Part, become sincere; or at least delude themselves in∣to a Relief that they are so.</P>
<P>For the Benent of this Society of Ladies, I shall propose one Rule to them as a Test of their Virtue. I find in a very celebrated modern Au∣thor, That the great Foundress of the Pietists, <HI>Madam de Bourignon,</HI> who was no less famous for the Sanctity of her Life than for the Singularity of some of her Opinions, was used to boast, That she had not only the Spirit of Continency in her self, but that she had also the Power of commu∣nicating it to all who beheld her. This the Scof∣fers of those Days called, <HI>The Gift of Infrigidation,</HI> and took Occasion from it to rally her Face, ra∣ther
<PB N="61" REF="68"/>
than admire her Virtue. I would therefore advise the <HI>Prude,</HI> who has a Mind to know the Integrity of her own Heart, to lay her Hand se∣riously upon it, and to examine her self, whether she could sincerely rejoice in such a Gift of con∣veying chast Thoughts to all her Male Beholders. If she has any Aversion to the Power of Inspring so great a Virtue, whatever Notion she may have of her Perfection, she deceives her own Heart, and is still in the State of <HI>Prudery.</HI> Some perhaps will look upon the Boast of <HI>Madam de Bourignon</HI> as the utmost Ostentation of a <HI>Prude.</HI></P>
<P>If you would see the Humour of a <HI>Coquet</HI> push∣ed to the last Excess, you may find an Instance of it in the following Story, which I will set down at length, because it pleased me when I read it, though I cannot recollect in what Au∣thor.</P>
<P>A young <HI>Coquet</HI> Widow in <HI>France</HI> having been followed by a <HI>Gascon</HI> of Quality, who had boasted among his Companions of some Favours which he had never received, to be revenged of him, sent for him one Evening, and told him, It was in his Power to do her a very particular Ser∣vice. The <HI>Gascon,</HI> with much Profession of his Readiness to obey her Commands, begged to hear in what Manner she designed to employ him. You know (said the Widow) my Friend <HI>Belinda,</HI> and must often have heard of the Jea∣lousy of that impotent Wretch her Husband. Now it is absolutely necessary, for the carrying on a certain Affair, That his Wife and I should be together a whole Night. What I have to ask of you is, to dress your self in her Night-Clothes, and lie by him a whole Night in her Place, that he may not miss her while she is with me. The <HI>Gascon</HI> (though of a very lively and undertaking Complexion) began to startle at the Proposal. Nay, says the Widow, if you have not the Cou∣rage to go through what I ask of you, I must
<PB N="62" REF="69"/>
employ some Body else that will. Madam; (says the <HI>Gascon</HI>) I'll kill him for you if you please; but for lying with him!—How is it possible to do it without being discovered? If you do not discover your self, (says the Widow) you will lie safe enough, for he is past all Curiosity. He comes in at Night while she is asleep, and goes out in a Morning before she awakes, and is in Pain for nothing, so he knows she is there. Ma∣dam, (replied the <HI>Gascon</HI>) How can you reward me for passing a Night with this old Fellow? The Widow answered with a Laugh, Perhaps by ad∣mitting you to pass a Night with one you think more agreeable. He took the Hint, put on his Night-Clothes, and had not been a-bed above an Hour before he heard a Knocking at the Door, and the Treading of one who approach'd the other Side of the Bed, and who he did not question was the good Man of the House. I do not know, whether the Story would be better by telling you in this Place, or at the End of it, That the Person who went to Bed to him, was our young <HI>Coquet</HI> Widow. The <HI>Gascon</HI> was in a terrible Fright every Time she moved in the Bed, or turned towards him, and did not fail to shrink from her till he had conveyed himself to the very Ridge of the Bed. I will not dwell upon the Perplexity he was in the whole Night, which was augmented, when he observed that it was now bread Day, and that the Husband did not yet offer to get up and go about his Bu∣siness. All that the <HI>Gascon</HI> had for it, was to keep his Face turned from him, and to feign himself asleep, when, to his utter Confusion, the Widow at last puts out her Arm, and pulls the Bell at her Bed's Head. In came her Friend, and Two or Three Companions to whom the <HI>Gascon</HI> had boasted of her Favours. The Wi∣dow jumped into a Wrapping-Gown, and joined with the rest in laughing at this Man of Intrigue.</P>

<P>THere is no Affection of the Mind so much blen∣ded in humane Nature, and wrought into our very Constitution, as Pride. It appears un∣der a Multitude of Disguises, and breaks out in Ten Thousand different Symptoms. Every one feels it in himself, and yet wonders to see it in his Neighbour. I must confess, I met with an Instance of it the other Day where I should very little have expected it. Who would believe the proud Person I am going to speak of, is a Cobler upon <HI>Ludgate-Hill?</HI> This Artist being naturally a Lover of Respect, and considering that his Cir∣cumstances are such that no Man living will give it him, has contrived the Figure of a Beau in Wood, who stands before him in a bending Po∣sture, with his Hat under his Left Arm, and his Right Hand extended in such a Manner as to hold a Thread, a Piece of Wax, or an Awl, according to the particular Service in which his Master thinks fit to employ him. When I saw him, he held a Candle in this obsequious Posture. I was very well pleased with the Cobler's Invention, that had so ingeniously contrived an Inferior, and stood a little while contemplating this invert∣ed Idolatry, wherein the Image did Homage to the Man. When we meet with such a fantastick Vanity in one of this Order, it is no Wonder if we may trace it through all Degrees above it,
<PB N="64" REF="71"/>
and particularly through all the Steps of Great∣ness. We casily see the Absurdity of Pride when it enters into the Heart of a Cobler; though in Reality it is altogether as ridiculous and unreaso∣nable wherever it takes Possession of an Humane Creature. There is no Temptation to it from the Reflexion upon our Being in general, or upon any Comparative Perfection, whereby one Man may excel another. The greater a Man's Know∣ledge is, the greater Motive he may seem to have for Pride; but in the same Proportion as the one rises, the other sinks, it being the chief Office of Wisdom to discover to us our Weaknesses and Imperfections.</P>
<P>As Folly is the Foundation of Pride, the na∣tural Superstructure of it is Madness. If there was an Occasion for the Experiment, I would not question to make a proud Man a Lunatick in Three Weeks Time, provided I had it in my Power to ripen his Phrensy with proper Applica∣tions. It is an admirable Reflection in <HI>Terence,</HI> where it is said of a Parasite, <HI>Hic Homines ex Stul∣tis facit Insanos. This Fellow</HI> (says he) <HI>has an Art of converting Fools into Madmen.</HI> When I was in <HI>France,</HI> (the Region of Complaisance and Vanity) I have often observed, that a great Man who has entered a Levy of Flatterers humble and tempe∣rate, has grown so insensibly heated by the Court, which was paid him on all Sides, that he has been quite distracted before he could get into his Coach.</P>
<P>If we consult the Collegiates of <HI>Moorfields,</HI> we shall find most of them are beholden to their Pride for their Introduction into that magnificent Palace. I had some Years ago the Curiosity to enquire into the particular Circumstances of these whimsical Freeholders, and learned from their own Mouths the Condition and Character of each of them. Indeed I found, that all I spoke to were Persons of Quality. There were at that
<PB N="65" REF="72"/>
Time Five Dutchesses, Three Earls, Two Hea∣then Gods, an Emperor, and a Prophet. There were also a great Number of such as were locked up from their Estates, and others who concealed their Titles. A Leather-seller of <HI>Taunton</HI> whis∣per'd me in my Ear, That he was the Duke of <HI>Monmouth;</HI> but begged me not to betray him. At a little Distance from him sat a Taylor's Wife, who asked me as I went by, if I had seen the Sword-bearer? Upon which I presumed to ask her, Who she was? And was answered, <HI>My Lady Mayoress.</HI></P>
<P>I was very sensibly touched with Compassion towards these miserable People; and indeed, ex∣tremely mortified to see Humane Nature capable of being thus disfigured. However, I reaped this Benefit from it, That I was resolved to guard my self against a Passion which makes such Havock in the Brain, and produces so much Disorder in the Imagination. For this Reason, I have endeavoured to keep down the secret Swel∣lings of Resentment, and stifle the very first Sug∣gestions of Self-esteem; to establish my Mind in Tranquility, and over-value nothing in my own, or in another's Possession.</P>
<P>For the Benefit of such whose Heads are a lit∣tle turned, though not to so great a Degree as to qualify them for the Place of which I have been now speaking, I shall assign one of the Sides of the College which I am erecting, for the Cure of this dangerous Distemper.</P>
<P>The most remarkable of the Persons whose Di∣sturbance arises from Pride, and whom I shall use all possible Diligence to cure, are such as are hidden in the Appearance of quite contrary Ha∣bits and Dispositions. Among such, I shall in the first Place take Care of one who is under the most subtle Species of Pride that I have observed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> my whole Experience.</P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="73"/>
This Patient is a Person for whom I have a great Respect, as being an old Courtier, and a Friend of mine in my Youth. The Man has but a bare Subsistence, just enough to pay his Reckoning with us at the <HI>Trumpet:</HI> But by having spent the Beginning of his Life in the Hearing of great Men and Persons of Power, he is always promi∣sing to do good Offices, to introduce every Man he converses with into the World; will desire one of ten Times his Substance to let him see him sometimes, and hints to him, that he does not forget him. He answers to Matters of no Consequence with great Circumspection; but however, maintains a general Civility in his Words and Actions, and an insolent Benevo∣lence to all whom he has to do with: This he practises with a grave Tone and Air; and tho' I am his Senior by Twelve Years, and richer by Forty Pounds <HI>per Annum,</HI> he had Yesterday the Impudence to commend me to my Face, and tell me, He should be always ready to encourage me. In a Word, he is a very insignificant Fel∣low, but exceeding Gracious. The best Return I can make him for his Favours, is, to carry him my self to <HI>Bedlam,</HI> and see him well taken Care of.</P>
<P>The next Person I shall provide for, is of a quite contrary Character; that has in him all the Stiffness and Insolence of Quality, without a Grain of Sense or Good Nature to make it either respected or belov'd. His Pride has infected every Muscle of his Face; and yet, after all his Endea∣vours to show Mankind that he contemns them, he is only neglected by all that see him, as not of Consequence enough to be hated.</P>
<P>For the Cure of this particular Sort of Mad∣ness, it will be necessary to break through all Forms with him, and familiarize his Carriage by the Use of a good Cudgel. It may likewise be of
<PB N="67" REF="74"/>
great Benefit to make him jump over a Stick half a Dozen Times every Morning.</P>
<P>A Third whom I have in my Eye is a young Fellow, whose Lunacy is such, that he boasts of nothing but what he ought to be ashamed of. He is vain of being rotten, and talks publickly of having committed Crimes, which he ought to be hanged for by the Laws of his Country.</P>
<P>There are several others whose Brains are hurt with Pride, and whom I may hereafter attempt to recover; but shall conclude my present List with an old Woman, who is just dropping into her Grave, that talks of nothing but her Birth. Tho' she has not a Tooth in her Head, she ex∣pects to be valued for the Blood in her Veins, which she fancies is much better than that which glows in the Cheeks of <HI>Belinda,</HI> and sets half the Town on Fire.</P>

<P>IT being discovered by the Stars, that about Ten Months hence, you will run the Hazard of being persecuted by many worthless Preten∣ders to your Person, unless timely prevented, I now offer my Service for your Security against the Persecution that threatens you. This is therefore to let you know, That I have con∣ceived a most extraordinary Passion for you; and that for several Days I have been perpetually haunted with the Vision of a Person I have ne∣ver yet seen. To satisfy you that I am in my Senses, and that I do not mistake you for any one of higher Rank, I assure you, that in your daily Employment, you appear to my Imagina∣tion more agreeable in a short scanty Petticoat, than the finest Woman of Quality in her spread∣ing Fardingal; and that the dextrous Twirl of your Mon has more native Charms, than the studied Airs of a Lady's Fan.

<P>This Letter seems to be written by a Wag, and for that Reason I am not much concern'd for what Reception <HI>Mopsa</HI> shall think fit to give it; but the following certainly proceeds from a poor Heart, that languishes under the most deplorable Misfortune that possibly can befal a Woman. A Man that is treacherously dealt with in Love, may have Recourse to many Consolations. He may gracefully break through all Opposition to his Mistress, or explain with his Rival; urge his own Constancy, or aggravate the Falshood by which it is repay'd. But a Woman that is ill <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>reated, has no Refuge in her Griefs but in Si∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ence and Secrecy.

<P>YOU seem in many of your Writings to be a Man of a very compassionate Temper, and well acquainted with the Passion of Love. This encourages me to apply my self to you in my present Distress, which I believe you will look upon to be very great, and treat with Ten∣derness, notwithstanding it wholly arises from Love, and that it is a Woman that makes this Confession. I am now in the Twenty third Year of my Age, and have for a great while entertained the Addresses of a Man who I thought lov'd me more than Life. I am sure I did him; and must own to you, not without some Confusion, that I have thought on no∣thing else for these two long Years, but the happy Life we should lead together, and the Means I should use to make my self still dearer to him. My Fortune was indeed much beyond his; and as I was always in the Company of my Relations, he was forced to discover his In∣clinations, and declare himself to me by Stories of other Persons, kind Looks, and many Ways, which he knew too well that I understood. Oh! Mr. <HI>Bickerstaff,</HI> it is impossible to tell you, how industrious I have been to make him ap∣pear lovely in my Thoughts. I made it a Point of Conscience to think well of him, and of no Man else: But he has since had an Estate fallen to him, and makes Love to another of a greater Fortune than mine. I could not believe the Re∣port of this at first; but about a Fortnight ago I was convinced of the Truth of it by his own
<PB N="71" REF="78"/>
Behaviour. He came to give our Family a formal Visit, when, as there were several in Company, and many Things talked of, the Discourse fell upon some unhappy Woman who was in my own Circumstances. It was said by one in the Room, That they could not be∣lieve the Story could be true, because they did not believe any Man could be so false. Upon which, I stole a Look upon him with an Anguish not to be express'd. He saw my Eyes full of Tears; yet had the Cruelty to say, That he could see no Falshood in Alterations of this Na∣ture, where there had been no Contracts or Vows interchanged. Pray, do not make a Jest of Misery, but tell me seriously your Opinion of his Behaviour; and if you can have any Pity for my Condition, publish this in your next Paper, that being the only Way I have of complaining of his Unkindness, and showing him the Injustice he has done me.

<P>WHen my Paper for to Morrow was prepa∣red for the Press, there came in this Mor∣ning a Mail from <HI>Holland,</HI> which brought me se∣veral Advices from Foreign Parts, and took my Thoughts off Domestick Affairs. Among others, I have a Letter from a Burgher of <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> who makes me his Compliments, and tells me, he has sent me several Draughts of Humorous and Satyrical Pictures by the best Hands of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Nation. They are a trading People, and in their very Minds Mechanicks. They express their Wit in Manufacture, as we do in Manu∣script. He informs me, That a very witty Hand has lately represented the present Posture of Pu∣blick Affairs in a Landskip, or rather Sea-piece, wherein the Potentates of the Alliance are fi∣gured as their Interests correspond with, or af∣fect each other, under the Appearance of Com∣manders of Ships. These Vessels carry the Co∣lours of the respective Nations concerned in the present War. The whole Design seems to tend
<PB N="73" REF="80"/>
to one Point, which is, That several Squadrons of <HI>British</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> Ships are battering a <HI>French</HI> Man of War, in order to make her deliver up a Long-Boat with <HI>Spanish</HI> Colours. My Corre∣spondent informs me, That a Man must under∣stand the Compass perfectly well, to be able to comprehend the Beauty and Invention of this Piece, which is so skilfully drawn, that the par∣ticular Views of every Prince in <HI>Europe,</HI> are seen according as the Ships lie to the main Figure in the Picture, and as that Figure may help or re∣tard their Sailing. It seems this Curiosity is now on Board a Ship bound for <HI>England,</HI> and with other Rarities made a Present to me. As soon as it arrives, I design to expose it to publick View at my Secretary Mr. <HI>Lillie</HI>'s, who shall have an Explication of all the Terms of Art; and I doubt not but it will give as good Con∣tent as the moving Picture in <HI>Fleet-street.</HI></P>

It would also be very acceptable here to receive an Ac∣count of those Two Religious Orders which are lately sprung up amongst you, the <HI>Whig,</HI>
<PB N="75" REF="82"/>
and the <HI>Tories,</HI> with the Points of Doctrine, Se∣verities in Discipline, Penances, Mortifications, and good Works, by which they differ one from another. It would be no less kind if you would explain to us a Word which they do not understand even at our <HI>English</HI> Mona∣stery, <HI>Toasts,</HI> and let us know whether the La∣dies so called are Nuns or Lay-Sisters.</P>
<P>In Return, I will send you the Secret History of several Cardinals, which I have by me in Manuscript, with Gallantries, Amours, Poli∣ticks, and Intrigues, by which they made their Way to the Holy Purple.</P>
<P>But when I propose a Correspondence, I must not tell you what I intend to advise you of hereafter, and neglect to give you what I have at present. The Pope has been sick for this Fortnight of a violent Tooth-Ach, which has very much raised the <HI>French</HI> Faction, and put the Conclave into a great Ferment. Every one of the Pretenders to the Succession, is grown Twenty Years older than he was a Fortnight ago. Each Candidate tries who shall cough and stoop most; for these are at pre∣sent the great Gifts that recommend to the Apostolical Seat, which he stands the fairest for, who is likely to resign it the soonest. I have known the Time when it used to rain Louis-d'Ors on such Occasions; but whatever is the Matter, there are very few of them to be seen at present at <HI>Rome,</HI> insomuch that it is thought a Man might purchase Infallibility at a very reasonable Rate. It is nevertheless ho∣ped, that his Holiness may recover, and bury these his imaginary Successors.</P>
<P>There has lately been found an Humane Tooth in a Catecomb, which has engaged a Couple of Convents in a Law-Suit; each of them pretending, That it belong'd to the Jaw-Bone of a Saint who was of their Order. The
<PB N="76" REF="83"/>
College have sate upon it thrice, and I fine there is a Disposition among them to take i out of the Possession of both the contending Parties, by reason of a Speech which was made by one of the Cardinals, who, by rea∣son of its being found out of the Company of any other Bones, asserted, That it migh be one of the Teeth which was coughed ou by <HI>Aelia,</HI> an old Woman, whose Loss is recorded in <HI>Martial.</HI></P>
<P>I have nothing remarkable to communicate to you of State-Affairs, excepting only, that the Pope has lately received an Horse from the <HI>Ger∣man</HI> Ambassador, as an Acknowledgment for the Kingdom of <HI>Naples,</HI> which is a Fief of the Church. His Holiness refused this Horse from the <HI>Germans</HI> ever since the Duke of <HI>Anjou</HI> has been possessed of <HI>Spain;</HI> but as they lately took Care to accompany it with a Body of Ten thou∣sand more, they have at last overcome his Ho∣liness's Modesty, and prevailed upon him to accept the Present.

<P>I Find some of the most polite <HI>Latin</HI> Authors, who wrote at a Time when <HI>Rome</HI> was in its Glory, speak with a certain noble Vanity of the Brightness and Splendour of the Age in which they lived. <HI>Pliny</HI> often compliments his Emperor <HI>Trajan</HI> upon this Head; and when he would ani∣mate him to any Thing great, or disswade him from any Thing that was improper, he insinuates, that it is befitting or unbecoming (the <HI>Claritas &amp; Nitor S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>uli</HI>) that Period of Time which was made illustrious by his Reign. When we cast our Eyes back on the History of Mankind, and trace them through their several Successions to their first Original, we sometimes see them break∣ing out in great and memorable Actions, and towring up to the utmost Heights of Virtue and Knowledge; when; perhaps, if we carry our Ob∣servation to a little Distance, we see them sunk into Sloth and Ignorance, and altogether lost in Darkness and Obscurity. Sometimes the whole Species is asleep for Two or Three Generations, and then again awakens into Action, flourishes in Heroes, Philosophers, and Poets, who do Ho∣nour to humane Nature, and leave such Tracts of Glory behind them, as distinguish the Years, in
<PB N="78" REF="85"/>
which they acted their Part, from the ordinary Course of Time.</P>
<P>Methinks a Man cannot, without a secret Sa∣tisfaction, consider the Glory of the present Age, which will shine as bright as any other in the Hi∣story of Mankind. It is still big with great E∣vents, and has already produced Changes and Re∣volutions which will be as much admired by Po∣sterity, as any that have happen'd in the Days of our Fathers, or in the old Times before them. We have seen Kingdoms divided and united, Mo∣narchs erected and deposed, Nations transferr'd from one Sovereign to another; Conquerors rai∣sed to such a Greatness as has given a Terror to <HI>Europe,</HI> and thrown down by such a Fall, as has moved their Pity.</P>
<P>But it is still a more pleasing View to an <HI>English∣man,</HI> to see his own Country give the chief In∣fluence to so illustrious an Age, and stand in the st ongest Point of Light amidst the diffused Glory that surrounds it.</P>
<P>If we begin with Learned Men, we may ob∣serve, to the Honour of our Country, That those who make the greatest Figure in most Arts and Sciences, are universally allowed to be of the <HI>Bri∣tish</HI> Nation; and what is more remarkable, That Men of the greatest Learning are among the Men of the greatest Quality.</P>
<P>A Nation may indeed abound with Persons of such uncommon Parts and Worth, as may make them rather a Misfortune than a Blessing to the Publick. Those who singly might have been of infinite Advantage to the Age they live in, may, by rising up together in the same Crisis of Time, and by interfering in their Pursuits of Honour, rather interrupt than promote the Service of their Country. Of this we have a famous Instance in the Republick of <HI>Rome,</HI> when <HI>Caesar, Pompey, Cato, Cicero,</HI> and <HI>Brutus,</HI> endeavoured to recom∣mend
<PB N="79" REF="86"/>
themselves at the same Time to the Admi∣ration of their Contemporaries. Mankind was not able to provide for so many extraordinary Persons at once, or find out Posts suitable to their Ambition and Abilities. For this Reason, they were all as miserable in their Deaths, as they were famous in their Lives, and occasioned, not only the Ruin of each other, but also that of the Commonwealth.</P>
<P>It is therefore a particular Happiness to a Peo∣ple, when the Men of superior Genius and Cha∣racter are so justly disposed in the high Places of Honour, that each of them moves in a Sphere which is proper to him, and requires those parti∣cular Qualities in which he excels.</P>
<P>If I see a General commanding the Forces of his Country, whose Victories are not to be parallel'd in Story, and who is as famous for his Negotia∣tions as his Victories; and at the same Time see the Management of a Nation's Treasury in the Hands of one who has always distinguish'd him∣self by a generous Contempt of his own private Wealth, and an exact Frugality of that which belongs to the Publick; I cannot but think a People under such an Administration may pro∣mise themselves Conquest abroad, and Plenty at home, If I were to wish for a proper Person to preside over the Publick Councils, it should cer∣tainly be one as much admir'd for his universal Knowledge of Men and Things, as for his Elo∣quence, Courage and Integrity, in the exerting of such extraordinary Talents.</P>
<P>Who is not pleased to see a Person in the highest Station in the Law, who was the most eminent in his Profession, and the most accomplished Orator at the Bar? Or at the Head of the Fleet a Com∣mander, under whose Conduct the Common Ene∣my received such a Blow, as he has never been able to recover?</P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="87"/>
Were we to form to our selves the Idea of one whom we should think proper to govern a distant Kingdom, consisting chiefly of those who differ from us in Religion, and are influenced by foreign Politicks, would it not be such a one as had sig∣nalized himself by an uniform and unshaken Zeal for the Protestant Interest, and by his Dexterity in defeating the Skill and Artifice of its Enemies. In short, if we find a great Man popular for his Honesty and Humanity, as well as famed for his Learning and great Skill in all the Languages of <HI>Europe,</HI> or a Person eminent for those Qualifica∣tions which make Men shine in publick Assem∣blies, or for that Steadiness, Constancy, and good Sense, which carry a Man to the desired Point through all the Opposition of Tumult and Preju∣dice, we have the Happiness to behold them all in Posts suitable to their Characters.</P>
<P>Such a Constellation of great Persons, if I may so speak, while they shine out in their own di∣stinct Capacities, reflect a Lustre upon each other, but in a more particular Manner on their Sove∣reign, who has placed them in those proper Situa∣tions, by which their Virtues become so beneficial to all Her Subjects. It is the Anniversary of the Birth-day of this Glorious Queen, which naturally led me into this Field of Contemplation, and in∣stead of joining in the publick Exultations that are made on such Occasions, to entertain my Thoughts with the more serious Pleasure of ruminating upon the Glories of Her Reign.</P>
<P>While I behold Her surrounded with Triumphs, and adorned with all the Prosperity and Success which Heaven ever shed on a Mortal, and still con∣sidering her self as such, tho' the Person appears to me exceedinggreat that has these just Honours paid to her; yet I must confess, she appears much great er in that she receives them with such a glo∣rious Humilility, and shows she has no further Re∣gard for them, than as they arise from these great
<PB N="81" REF="88"/>
Events which have made her Subjects happy. For my own Part, I must confess, when I see private Virtues in so high a Degree of Perfection, I am not astonished at any extraordinary Success that attends them, but look upon publick Triumphs as the natural Consequences of religious Retire∣ments.</P>

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>Finding some Persons have mistaken <HI>Pasquin</HI> who was mentioned in my last, for one who has been pil∣loried at <HI>Rome;</HI> I must here advertise them, That it is only a maimed Statue so called, on which the private Scandal of that City is generally pasted. <HI>Morforio</HI> is a Person of the same Quality, who is usually made to answer whatever is published by the other: The Wits of that Place, like too many of our own Country, taking Pleasure in setting innocent People together by the Ears. The Mentioning of this Person, who is a great Wit, and a great Cripple, put me in Mind of Mr. <HI>Eastcourt,</HI> who is under the same Circumstances. He was formerly my Apothecary, and being at present disabled by the Gout and Stone, I must recommend him to the Publick on <HI>Thursday</HI> next, that admirable Play of <HI>Ben. Johnson</HI>'s, called, <HI>The silent Woman,</HI> being appointed to be acted for his Benefit. It would be indecent for me to appear twice in a Season at these ludicrous Diversions; but as I always give my Man and my Maid one Day in the Year, I shall allow them this, and am promised by Mr. <HI>Eastcourt,</HI> my ingenious Apothecary, that they shall have a Place kept for them in the first Row of the Middle Gallery.</P>

<P>THere is in this City a certain Fraternity of Chymical Operators, who work under Ground in Holes, Caverns, and dark Retirements, to conceal their Mysteries from the Eyes and Ob∣servation of Mankind. These Subterraneous Phi∣losophers are daily employed in the Transmuta∣tion of Liquors, and, by the Power of Magical Drugs and Incantations, raising under the Streets of <HI>London</HI> the choicest Products of the Hills and Valleys of <HI>France.</HI> They can squeeze <HI>Bourdeaux</HI> out of the <HI>Sloe,</HI> and draw <HI>Champagne</HI> from an <HI>Ap∣ple. Virgil</HI> in that remarkable Prophecy,
<Q><L>Incultisque rubens pendebit Sentibus Uva.</L></Q><Q><L>" The ripening Grape shall hang on ev'ry Thorn.</L></Q> Seems to have hinted at this Art, which can turn a Plantation of <HI>Northern</HI> Hedges into a Vineyard. These Adepts are known among one another by the Name of Wine-Brewers, and I am afraid do great Injury, not only to Her Majesty's Customs, but to the Bodies of many of Her good Subjects.</P>
<P>Having received sundry Complaints against these invisible Workmen, I ordered the proper Officer of my Court to ferret them out of their respective Caves, and bring them before me, which was Ye∣sterday executed accordingly.</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="90"/>
The Person who appeared against them was a Merchant, who had by him a great Magazine of Wines that he had laid in before the War: But these Gentlemen (as he said) had so vitiated the Nation's Palate, that no Man could believe his to be <HI>French,</HI> because it did not tast like what they sold for such. As a Man never pleads better than where his own Personal Interest is concern'd, he exhibited to the Court with great Eloquence, That this new Corporation of Druggists had inflamed the Bills of Mortality, and puzzled the College of Physicians with Diseases, for which they neither knew a Name or Cure. He accused some of gi∣ving all their Customers Colicks and Megrims; and mentioned one who had boasted, he had a Tun of Claret by him, that in a Fortnight's Time should give the Gout to a Dozen of the healthful∣est Men in the City, provided that their Constitu∣tions were prepared for it by Wealth and Idleness. He then enlarged, with a great Show of Reason, upon the Prejudice which these Mixtures and Compositions had done to the Brains of the <HI>Eng∣lish</HI> Nation; as is too visible (said he) from many late Pamphlets, Speeches and Sermons, as well as from the ordinary Conversations of the Youth of this Age. He then quoted an ingenious Person, who would undertake to know by a Man's Wri∣tings, the Wine he most delighted in; and on that Occasion named a certain Satyrist, whom he had discovered to be the Author of a Lampoon, by the manifest Tast of the Sloe, which show'd it self in it by much Roughness, and little Spirit.</P>
<P>In the last Place, he ascribed to the unnatural Tumults and Fermentations which these Mixtures raise in our Blood; the Divisions, Heats and Ani∣mosities, that reign among us; and in particular, asserted most of the modern Enthusiasms and Agitations to be nothing else but the Effects of adulterated <HI>Port.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="91"/>
The Council for the Brewers had a Face so ex∣tremely inflamed and illuminated with Carbun∣cles, that I did not wonder to see him an Advo∣cate for these Sophistications. His Rhetorick was likewise such as I should have expected from the common Draught, which I found he often drank to a great Excess. Indeed, I was so surprised at his Figure and Parts, that I ordered him to give me a Tast of his usual Liquor; which I had no sooner drank, but I found a Pimple rising in my F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ehead; and felt such a sensible Decay in my Understanding, that I would not proceed in the Trial till the Fume of it was entirely dissipa∣ted.</P>
<P>This notable Advocate had little to say in the Defence of his C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ents, but that they were under a Necessity of making Claret if they would keep open their Doors, it being the Nature of Man∣kind to love every Thing that is prohibited. He further pretended to reason, That it might be as profitable to the Nation to make <HI>French</HI> Wine as <HI>French</HI> Hats; and concluded with the great Ad∣vantage that this had already brought to Part of the Kingdom. Upon which he informed the Court, That the Lands in <HI>Herefordshire</HI> were rai∣sed Two Years Purchase since the Beginning of the War.</P>
<P>When I had sent out my Summons to these Peo∣ple, I gave at the same Time Orders to each of them to bring the several Ingredients he made use of in distinct Phials, which they had done ac∣cordingly, and ranged them into two Rows on each Side of the Court. The Workmen were drawn up in Ranks behind them. The Merchant informed me, That in one Row of Phials were the several Colours they dealt in, and in the other the Tasts. He then showed me on the Right Hand one who went by the Name of <HI>Tom. Tintoret,</HI> who (as he told me) was the greatest Master in his Colouring of any Vintner in <HI>London.</HI> To give me
<PB N="85" REF="92"/>
a Proof of his Art, he took a Glass of fair Water; and by the Infusion of Three Drops out of one of his Phials, converted it into a most beautiful pale <HI>Burgundy.</HI> Two more of the same Kind heighten∣ed it into a perfect <HI>Languedoc:</HI> From thence it pas∣sed into a florid <HI>Hermitage:</HI> And after having gone through Two or Three other Changes, by the Ad∣dition of a single Drop, ended in a very deep <HI>Pontack.</HI> This ingenious Vertuoso seeing me very much surprised at his Art, told me, That he had not an Opportunity of showing it in Perfection, having only made use of Water for the Ground-Work of his Colouring: But that if I were to see an Operation upon Liquors of stronger Bodies, the Art would appear to a much greater Advan∣tage. He added, That he doubted not but it would please my Curiosity to see the Cyder of one Apple take only a Vermilion, when another, with a less Quantity of the same Infusion, would rise into a dark Purple, according to the different Texture of Parts in the Liquor. He informed me also, That he could hit the different Shades and Degrees of Red, as they appear in the Pink and the Rose, the Clove and the Carnation, as he had <HI>Rhenish</HI> or <HI>Moselle, Perry</HI> or <HI>White Port,</HI> to work in.</P>
<P>I was so satisfied with the Ingenuity of this Vertuoso, that, after having advised him to quit so dishonest a Profession, I promised him, in Con∣sideration of his great Genius, to recommend him as a Partner to a Friend of mine, who has heaped up great Riches, and is a Scarlet Dyer.</P>
<P>The Artists on my other Hand were ordered in the Second Place to make some Experiments of their Skill before me: Upon which the famous <HI>Harry Sippet</HI> stept out, and asked me, What I would be pleased to drink? At the same Time he filled out Three or Four white Liquors in a Glass, and told me, That it should be what I pleased to tall for; adding very learnedly, That the Liquor
<PB N="86" REF="93"/>
before him was as the naked Substance or First Matter of his Compound, to which he and his Friend; who stood over-against him, could give what Accidents or Form they pleased. Finding him so great a Philosopher, I desired he would convey into it the Qualities and Essence of right <HI>Bourdeaux.</HI> Coming, coming, Sir, (said he) with the Air of a Drawer; and after having cast his Eye on the several Tasts and Flavours that stood before him, he took up a little Cruit that was filled with a kind of Inky Juice, and pour∣ing some of it out into the Glass of White-Wine, presented it to me, and told me, This was the Wine over which most of the Business of the last Term had been dispatched. I must confess, I looked upon that sooty Drug which he held up in his Cruit as the Quintessence of <HI>English Bour∣deaux,</HI> and therefore desired him to give me a Glass of it by it self, which he did with great Un∣willingness. My Cat at that Time sat by me upon the Elbow of my Chair; and as I did not care for making the Experiment upon my self, I reached it to her to sip of it, which had like to have cost her her Life; for notwithstanding it flung her at first into freakish Tricks, quite con∣trary to her usual Gravity, in less than a quarter of an Hour she fell into Convulsions; and had it not been a Creature more tenacious of Life than any other, would certainly have died under the Operation.</P>
<P>I was so incensed by the Tortures of my inno∣cent Domestick, and the unworthy Dealings of these Men, that I told them, if each of them had as many Lives as the injured Creature before them, they deserved to forfeit them for the per∣nicious Arts which they used for their Profit. I therefore bid them look upon themselves as no better than as a kind of Assassins and Murderers within the Law. However, since they had dealt so clearly with me, and laid before me their
<PB N="87" REF="94"/>
whole Practice. I dismissed them for that Time; with a particular Request, That they would not poison any of my Friends and Acquaintance, and take to some honest Livelihood without Loss of Time.</P>
<P>For my own Part, I have resolved hereafter to be very careful in my Liquors, and have agreed with a Friend of mine in the Army, upon their next March, to secure me Two Hogsheads of the best Stomach Wine in the Cellars of <HI>Versailles,</HI> for the good of my Lucubrations, and the Comfort of my old Age.</P>

<P>AFter having applied my Mind with more than ordinary Attention to my Studies, it is my usual Custom to relax and unbend it in the Conversation of such as are rather easy than shi∣ning Companions. This I find particularly ne∣cessary for me before I retire to Rest, in order to draw my Slumbers upon me by Degrees, and fall asleep insensibly. This is the particular Use I make of a Set of heavy honest Men, with whom I have passed many Hours with much Indolence, though not with great Pleasure. Their Conver∣sation is a kind of Preparative for Sleep: It takes the Mind down from its Abstractions, leads it in∣to the familiar Traces of Thought, and lulls it into
<PB N="88" REF="95"/>
that State of Tranquility, which is the Condition of a thinking Man when he is but half awake. After this, my Reader will not be surprised to hear the Account which I am about to give of a Club of my own Contemporaries, among whom I pass Two or Three Hours every Evening. This I look upon as taking my first Nap before I go to Bed. The Truth of it is, I should think my self unjust to Posterity, as well as to the Society at the <HI>Trumpet,</HI> of which I am a Member, did not I in some Part of my Writings give an Account of the Persons among whom I have passed almost a Sixth Part of my Time for these last Forty Years. Our Club consisted originally of Fifteen; but partly by the Severity of the Law in arbitrary Times, and partly by the natural Effects of old Age, we are at present reduced to a Third Part of that Number: In which however we have this Consolation, That the best Company is said to consist of Five Persons. I must confess, besides the aforementioned Benefit which I meet with in the Conversation of this select Society, I am not the less pleased with the Company, in that I find my self the greatest Wit among them, and am heard as their Oracle in all Points of Learning and Difficulty.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Jeoffrey Notch,</HI> who is the oldest of the Club, has been in Possession of the Right Hand Chair Time out of Mind, and is the only Man among us that has the Liberty of stirring the Fire. This our Foreman is a Gentleman of an ancient Family, that came to a great Estate some Years before he had Discretion, and run it out in Hounds, Hor∣ses, and Cock-fighting; for which Reason he looks upon himself as an honest worthy Gentle∣man who has had Misfortunes in the World, and calls every thriving Man a pitiful Upstart.</P>
<P>Major <HI>Matchlock</HI> is the next Senior, who served in the last Civil Wars, and has all the Battles by Heart. He does not think any Action in <HI>Europe</HI>
<PB N="89" REF="96"/>
worth talking of since the Fight of <HI>Marston-Moor;</HI> and every Night tells us of his having been knock'd off his Horse at the Rising of the <HI>London</HI> 'Prentices; for which he is in great Esteem amongst us.</P>
<P>Honest old <HI>Dick Reptile</HI> is the Third of our So∣ciety: He is a good natured indolent Man, who speaks little himself, but laughs at our Jokes, and brings his young Nephew along with him, a Youth of Eighteen Years old, to show him good Company, and give him a Tast of the World. This young Fellow sits generally silent; but when∣ever he opens his Mouth, or laughs at any Thing that passes, he is constantly told by his Uncle, after a jocular Manner, <Q REND="inline">"Ay, ay, <HI>Jack,</HI> you young Men think us Fools; but we old Men know you are.'</Q></P>
<P>The greatest Wit of our Company, next to my self, is a Bencher of the neighbouring Inn, who in his Youth frequented the Ordinaries about <HI>Cha∣ring-Cross,</HI> and pretends to have been intimate with <HI>Jack Ogle.</HI> He has about Ten Distichs of <HI>Hudibras</HI> without Book, and never leaves the Club till he has applied them all. If any modern Wit be mentioned, or any Town Frolick spoken of, he shakes his Head at the Dulness of the pre∣sent Age, and tells us a Story of <HI>Jack Ogle.</HI></P>
<P>For my own Part, I am esteemed among them, because they see I am something respected by others, though at the same Time I understand by their Behaviour, that I am considered by them as a Man of a great deal of Learning, but no Know∣ledge of the World; insomuch that the Major sometimes, in the Height of his Military Pride, calls me the Philosopher: And Sir <HI>Jeoffrey</HI> no lon∣ger ago than last Night, upon a Dispute what Day of the Month it was then in <HI>Holland,</HI> pulled his Pipe out of his Mouth, and cried, What does the Scholar say to it?</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="97"/>
Our Club meets precisely at Six a Clock in the Evening; but I did not come last Night till Half an Hour after Seven, by which Means I escaped the Battle of <HI>Naseby,</HI> which the Major usually be∣gins at about Three Quarters after Six; I found also, That my good Friend, the Bencher, had al∣ready spent Three of his Distichs, and only wait∣ing an Opportunity to hear a Sermon spoken of, that he might introduce the Couplet where <HI>a-Stick</HI> rhimes to <HI>Ecclesiastick.</HI> At my Entrance in∣to the Room, they were naming a red Petticoat and a Cloak, by which I found that the Ben∣cher had been diverting them with a Story of <HI>Jack Ogle.</HI></P>
<P>I had no sooner taken my Seat, but Sir <HI>Jeoffrey,</HI> to show his good Will towards me, gave me a Pipe of his own Tobacco, and stirred up the Fire. I lock upon it as a Point of Morality, to be obliged by those who endeavour to oblige me; and there∣fore in Requital for his Kindness, and to set the Conversation a going, I took the best Occasion I could, to put him upon telling us the Story of old <HI>Gantlett,</HI> which he always does with very parti∣cular Concern. He traced up his Descent on both Sides for several Generations, describing his Diet and Manner of Life, with his several Battles, and particularly that in which he fell. This <HI>Gantlett</HI> was a Game-Cock, upon whose Head the Knight in his Youth had won Five Hundred Pounds, and lost Two Thousand. This naturally set the Major upon the Account of <HI>Edge-hill</HI> Fight, and ended in a Duel of <HI>Jack Ogle</HI>'s</P>
<P>Old <HI>Reptile</HI> was extremely attentive to all that was said, tho' it was the same he had heard every Night for these Twenty Years, and upon all Oc∣casions, winked upon his Nephew to mind what passed.</P>
<P>This may suffice to give the World a Tast of our innocent Conversation, which we spun out till about Ten of the Clock, when my Maid came
<PB N="91" REF="98"/>
with a Lanthorn to light me Home. I could not but reflect with my self as I was going out upon the talkative Humour of old Men, and the little Figure which that Part of Life makes in one who cannot employ this natural Propensity in Discour∣ses which would make him venerable. I must own, it makes me very melancholy in Company, when I hear a young Man begin a Story; and have often observ'd, That one of a Quarter of an Hour long in a Man of Five and twenty, gathers Circumstances every Time he tells it, till it grows into a long <HI>Canterbury</HI> Tale of two Hours by that Time he is Threescore.</P>
<P>The only Way of avoiding such a trifling and frivolous old Age, is, to lay up in our Way to it such Stores of Knowledge and Observation as may make us useful and agreeable in our declining Years. The Mind of Man in a long Life will become a Magazine of Wisdom or Folly, and will consequently discharge it self in something im∣pertinent or improving. For which Reason, as there is nothing more ridiculous than an old tri∣fling Story-Teller, so there is nothing more vene∣rable than one who has turned his Experience to the Entertainment and Advantage of Mankind.</P>
<P>In short, we who are in the last Stage of Life, and are apt to indulge our selves in Talk, ought to consider, if what we speak be worth being heard, and endeavour to make our Discourse like that of <HI>Nastor,</HI> which Homer compares to the Flowing of Honey for its Sweetness.</P>
<P>I am afraid I shall be thought guilty of this Excess I am speaking of, when I cannot conclude without observing, that <HI>Milton</HI> certainly thought of this Passage in Homer when in his Description of an eloquent Spirit, he says, <HI>His Tongue drop'd Manna.</HI></P>

<P>SIlence is sometimes more significant and su∣blime than the most noble and most expres∣sive Eloquence, and is on many Occasions the In∣dication of a great Mind. Several Authors have treated of Silence as a Part of Duty and Discre∣tion, but none of them have considered it in this Light. Homer compares the Noise and Clamour of the <HI>Trojans</HI> advancing towards the Enemy, to the Cackling of Cranes when they invade an Army of Pigmies. On the contrary, he makes his Countrymen and Favourites, the <HI>Greeks,</HI> move forward in a regular determined March, and in the Depth of Silence. I find in the Accounts which are given us of some of the more <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ast<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/></HI> Nations, where the Inhabitants are disposed by their Constitutions and Climates to higher Strains of Thought, and more elevated Raptures than what we feel in the <HI>Northern</HI> Regions of the World, That Silence is a Religious Exercise among them. For when their publick Devotions are in the greatest Fervour, and their Hearts lifted up as high as Words can raise them, there are cer∣tain Suspensions of Sound and Motion for a Time, in which the Mind is left to it self, and supposed to swell with such secret Conceptions as are too big for Utterance. I have my self been wonder∣fully delighted with a Master-piece of Musick, when in the very Tumult and Ferment of their Harmony, all the Voices and Instruments have
<PB N="93" REF="100"/>
stopped short on a sudden, and after a little Pause recovered themselves again as it were, and renew∣ed the Concert in all its Parts. Methoughts this short Interval of Silence has had more Mufick in it than any the same Space of Time before or af∣ter it. There are Two Instances of Silence in the Two greatest Poets that ever wrote, which have something in them as sublime as any of the Speeches in their whole Works. The First is that of <HI>Ajax,</HI> in the Eleventh Book of the <HI>Odys∣sy. Ulysses,</HI> who had been the Rival of this great Man in his Life, as well as the Occasion of his Death, upon meeting his Shade in the Region of departed Heroes, makes his Submission to him with an Humility next to Adoration, which the other passes over with dumb sullen Majesty, and such a Silence, as (to use the Words of <HI>Longinus</HI>) had more Greatness in it than any Thing he could have spoken.</P>
<P>The next Instance I shall mention is in <HI>Virgil,</HI> where the Poet, doubtless, imitates this Silence of <HI>Ajax</HI> in that of <HI>Dido;</HI> though I do not know that any of his Commentators have taken Notice of it. <HI>Aeneas</HI> finding among the Shades of de∣spairing Lovers, the Ghost of her who had lately died for him, with the Wound still fresh upon her, addresses himself to her with expanded Arms, Floods of Tears, and the most passionate Profes∣sions of his own Innocence as to what had hap∣pen'd; all which <HI>Dido</HI> receives with the Dignity and Disdain of a resenting Lover, and an injured Queen; and is so far from vouchsafing him an Answer, that she does not give him a single Look. The Poet represents her as turning away her Face from him while he spoke to her; and after ha∣ving kept her Eyes for some Time upon the Ground, as one that heard and contemned his Protestations, flying from him into the Grove of Myrtle, and into the Arms of another, whose Fi∣delity had deserved her Love.</P>
<P><PB N="94" REF="101"/>
I have often thought our Writers of Tragedy have been very defective in this Particular, and that they might have given great Beauty to their Works, by certain Stops and Pauses in the Re∣presentation of such Passions, as it is not in the Power of Language to express. There is some∣thing like this in the last Act of <HI>Venice Preserv'd,</HI> where <HI>Pierre</HI> is brought to an infamous Execu∣tion, and begs of his Friend, as a Reparation for past Injuries, and the only Favour he could do him, to rescue him from the Ignominy of the Wheel by stabbing him. As he is going to make this dreadful Request, he is not able to commu∣nicate it, but withdraws his Face from his Friend's Ear, and bursts into Tears. The melan∣choly Silence that follows hereupon, and conti∣nues till he has recovered himself enough to re∣veal his Mind to his Friend, raises in the Specta∣tors a Grief that is inexpressible, and an Idea of such a complicated Distress in the Actor, as Words cannot utter. It would look as ridiculous to many Readers to give Rules and Directions for proper Silences, as for <HI>Penning a Whisper:</HI> But it is certain, that in the Extremity of most Passions, particularly Surprise, Admiration, Astonishment, nay, Rage it self; there is nothing more graceful than to see the Play stand still for a few Moments, and the Audience fixed in an agreeable Suspence, during the Silence of a skilful Actor.</P>
<P>But Silence never shows it self to so great an Advantage, as when it is made the Reply to Ca∣lumny and Defamation, provided that we give no just Occasion for them. We might produce an Example of it in the Behaviour of one in whom it appeared in all its Majesty, and one, whose Si∣lence, as well as his Person, was altogether Di∣vine. When one considers this Subject only in its Sublimity, this great Instance could not but occur to me; and since I only make Use of it to show the highest Example of it, I hope I do not offend
<PB N="95" REF="102"/>
in it. To forbear replying to an unjust Reproach, and overlook it with a generous, or (if possible) with an entire Neglect of it, is one of the most heroick Acts of a great Mind: And I must con∣fess, when I reflect upon the Behaviour of some of the greatest Men in Antiquity, I do not so much admire them that they deserved the Praise of the whole Age they lived in, as because they con∣temned the Envy and Detraction of it.</P>
<P>All that is incumbent on a Man of Worth, who suffers under so ill a Treatment, is to lie by for some Time in Silence and Obscurity, till the Pre∣judice of the Times be over, and his Reputation cleared. I have often read with a great deal of Pleasure a Legacy of the famous Lord <HI>Bacon,</HI> one of the greatest Genius's that our own or any Country has produced: After having bequeathed his Soul, Body, and Estate, in the usual Form, he adds, <Q REND="inline">'My Name and Memory I leave to Foreign Nations, and to my Countrymen, after some Time be passed over.'</Q></P>
<P>At the same Time that I recommend this Philo∣sophy to others, I must confess, I am so poor a Proficient in it my self, that if in the Course of my Lucubrations it happens, as it has done more than once, that my Paper is duller than in Con∣science it ought to be, I think the Time an Age till I have an Opportunity of putting out another, and growing famous again for Two Days.</P>
<P>I must not close my Discourse upon Silence, without informing my Reader, That I have by me an elaborate Treatise on the <HI>Aposiopesis</HI> called an <HI>Et caetera,</HI> it being a Figure much used by some learned Authors, and particularly by the great <HI>Littleton,</HI> who, as my Lord Chief Justice <HI>Coke</HI> ob∣serves, had a most admirable Talent at an <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>

<P>I WAS awakened very early this Morning by the distant Crowing of a Cock, which I thought had the finest Pipe I ever heard. He seemed to me to strain his Voice more than ordi∣nary, as if he designed to make himself heard to the remotest Corner of this Lane. Having enter∣tained my self a little before I went to Bed with a Discourse on the Transmigration of Men into other Animals, I could not but fancy that this was the Soul of some drowsy Bell-man who used to sleep upon his Post, for which he was con∣demned to do Pennance in Feathers, and distin∣guish the several Watches of the Night under the Outside of a Cock. While I was thinking of the Condition of this poor Bell-man in Mas∣querade, I heard a great Knocking at my Door, and was soon after told by my Maid, That my worthy Friend the tall black Gentleman, who frequents the Coffee-houses hereabouts, desired

This ancient <HI>Pythagorean,</HI> who has as much Honesty as any Man living, but good Nature to an Excess, brought me the following Petition, which I am apt to believe he penned himself, the Pititioner not being able to express his Mind in Paper under his present Form, however famous he might have been for writing Verses when he was in his original Shape.</P>

<P>THat whereas your Petitioner is truly de∣scended of the ancient Family of the <HI>Chanticleers</HI> at <HI>Cock-Hall</HI> near <HI>Rumford</HI> in <HI>Essex,</HI> it has been his Misfortune to come into the mercenary Hands of a certain ill-disposed Per∣son, commonly called an <HI>Higler,</HI> who, under the close Confinement of a Pannier, has con∣veyed him and many others up to <HI>London;</HI> but hearing by Chance of your Worship's great Humanity towards Robin-Redbreasts and Tom-Tits, he is embolden'd to beseech you to take his deplorable Condition into your tender Con∣sideration, who otherwise must suffer (with many Thousands more as innocent as himself) that inhumane Barbarity of a <HI>Shrove-Tuesday</HI> Persecution.

Upon Delivery of this Petition, the worthy Gentleman who presented it, told me the Cu∣stoms of many wise Nations of the <HI>East,</HI> through which he had travelled; That nothing was more frequent than to see a Dervees lay out a whole Year's Income in the Redemption of Larks or Linets that had unhappily fallen into the Hands of Bird-Catchers: That it was also usual to run between a Dog and a Bull to keep them from hurting one another, or to lose the Use of a Limb in parting a Couple of furious Mastiffs. He then insisted upon the Ingratitude and Disin∣genuity of treating in this Manner a necessary and Domestick Animal, that has made the whole House keep good Hours, and called up the Cook-Maid for five Years together. What would a <HI>Turk</HI> say, continued he, should he hear, that it is a common Entertainment in a Nation which pretends to be one of the most ci∣vilized of <HI>Europe,</HI> to tie an innocent Animal to a Stake, and put him to an ignominious Death, who has perhaps been the Guardian and Prove∣ditor of a poor Family, as long as he was able to get Eggs for his Mistress.</P>
<P>I thought what this Gentleman said was very reasonable; and have often wondered, that we do not lay aside a Custom which makes us appear barbarous to Nations much more rude and unpo∣lished than our selves. Some <HI>French</HI> Writers have represented this Diversion of the common People much to our Disadvantage, and imputed it to natural Fierceness and Cruelty of Temper; as they do some other Entertainments peculiar to our Nation: I mean those elegant Diversions of Bull-baiting and Prize-fighting, with the like ingenious Recreations of the Bear-Garden. I wish I knew how to answer this Reproach which is cast upon us, and excuse the Death of so many innocent Cocks, Bulls, Dogs, and
<PB N="100" REF="107"/>
Bears, as have been set together by the Ears, or died untimely Deaths, only to make us Sport.</P>
<P>It will be said, That these are the Entertain∣ments of common People. It is true; but they are the Entertainments of no other common People. Besides, I am afraid there is a Tincture of the same savage Spirit in the Diversions of those of higher Rank, and more refined Relish. <HI>Rapine</HI> observes, That the <HI>English</HI> Theatre very much delights in Bloodshed, which he likewise represents as an Indication of our Tempers. I must own, there is something very horrid in the publick Executions of an <HI>English</HI> Tragedy. Stab∣bing and Poisoning, which are performed behind the Scenes in other Nations, must be done openly among us, to gratify the Audience.</P>
<P>When poor <HI>Sandford</HI> was upon the Stage, I have seen him groaning upon a Wheel, stuck with Daggers, impaled alive, calling his Execu∣tioners, with a dying Voice, Cruel Dogs and Villains! And all this to please his judicious Spectators, who were wonderfully delighted with seeing a Man in Torment so well acted. The Truth of it is, the Politeness of our <HI>English</HI> Stage, in Regard to <HI>Decorum,</HI> is very extraordinary. We act Murders to show our Intrepidity, and Adulteries to show our Gallantry: Both of them are frequent in our most taking Plays, with this Difference only, That the First are done in the Sight of the Audience, and the other wrought up to such an Height upon the Stage, that they are almost put in Execution before the Actors can get behind the Scenes.</P>
<P>I would not have it thought, that there is jus<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Ground for those Consequences which our Ene∣mies draw against us from these Practises; bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> methinks one would be sorry for any Manner o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Occasion for such Misrepresentations of us. Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Virtues of Tenderness, Compassion, and Huma¦nity, are those by which Men are distinguish'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="101" REF="108"/>
from Brutes, as much as by Reason it self; and it would be the greatest Reproach to a Nation to distinguish it self from all others by any De∣fect in these particular Virtues. For which Rea∣sons, I hope that my dear Countrymen will no longer expose themselves by an Effusion of Blood, whether it be of Theatrical Heroes, Cocks, or any other innocent Animals, which we are not obliged to slaughter for our Safety, Convenience, or Nourishment. Where any of these Ends are not serv'd in the Destruction of a living Crea∣ture, I cannot but pronounce it a great Piece of Cruelty, if not a kind of Murder.</P>

<P>SEveral Letters which I have lately received give me Information, That some well-dis∣posed Persons have taken Offence at my using the Word Free-Thinker as a Term of Reproach. To set therefore this Matter in a clear Light, I must declare, That no one can have a greater Veneration than my self for the Free-Thinkers of Antiquity, who acted the same Part in those Times, as the great Men of the Reformation did in several Nations of <HI>Europe,</HI> by exerting them∣selves
<PB N="102" REF="109"/>
against the Idolatry and Superstition of the Times in which they lived. It was by this noble Impulse that <HI>Socrates</HI> and his Disciples, as well as all the Philosophers of Note in <HI>Greece,</HI> and <HI>Cicero, Seneca,</HI> with all the Learned Men of <HI>Rome,</HI> endeavoured to enlighten their Contem∣poraries amidst the Darkness and Ignorance in which the World was then sunk and buried. The great Points which these Free-Thinkers en∣deavoured to establish and inculcate into the Minds of Men, was, the Formation of the Uni∣verse, the Superintendency of Providence, the Perfection of the Divine Nature, the Immorta∣lity of the Soul, and the future State of Rewards and Punishments. They all complied with the Religion of their Country, as much as possible, in such Particulars as did not contradict and per∣vert these great and fundamental Doctrines of Mankind. On the contrary, the Persons who now set up for Free-Thinkers, are such as endea∣vour by a little Trash of Words and Sophistry, to weaken and destroy those very Principles, for the Vindication of which, Freedom of Thought at first became laudable and heroick. These Apostates, from Reason and good Sense, can look at the glorious Frame of Nature, with∣out paying an Adoration to him that raised it; can consider the great Revolutions in the Universe, without lifting up their Minds to that Superior Power which hath the Direction of it; can presume to censure the Deity in his Ways to∣wards Men; can level Mankind with the Beasts that perish; can extinguish in their own Minds all the pleasing Hopes of a future State, and lull themselves into a stupid Security against the Terrors of it. If one were to take the Word Priestcraft out of the Mouths of these shallow Monsters, they would be immediately struck dumb. It is by the Help of this single Term that they endeavour to disappoint the good
<PB N="103" REF="110"/>
Works of the most Learned and Venerable Order of Men, and harden the Hearts of the Igno∣rant against the very Light of Nature, and the common received Notions of Mankind. We ought not to treat such Miscreants as these upon the Foot of fair Disputants, but to pour out Con∣tempt upon them, and speak of them with Scorn and Infamy, as the Pests of Society, the Revilers of Humane Nature, and the Blasphemers of a Being, whom a good Man would rather die than hear dishonoured. <HI>Cicero,</HI> after having men∣tioned the great Heroes of Knowledge that re∣commended this Divine Doctrine of the Immor∣tality of the Soul, calls those small Pretenders to Wisdom who declared against it, certain <HI>Minute</HI> Philosophers, using a Diminutive even of the Word Little, to express the despicable Opinion he had of them. The Contempt he throws up∣on them in another Passage is yet more remarka∣ble, where, to show the mean Thoughts he entertains of them, he declares, he would rather be in the Wrong with <HI>Plato,</HI> than in the Right with such Company. There is indeed nothing in the World so ridiculous as one of these grave Philosophical Free-Thinkers, that hath neither Passions nor Appetites to gratify, no Heats of Blood nor Vigour of Constitution that can turn his Systems of Infidelity to his Advantage, or raise Pleasures out of them which are incon∣sistent with the Belief of an Hereafter. One that has neither Wit, Gallantry, Mirth, or Youth, to indulge by these Notions, but only a poor, joyless uncomfortable Vanity of distin∣guishing himself from the rest of Mankind, is rather to be regarded as a Mischievous Luna∣tick, than a mistaken Philosopher. A chast In∣fidel, a speculative Libertine, is an Animal that I should not believe to be in Nature, did I not sometimes meet with this Species of Men, that plead for the Indulgence of their Passions in the
<PB N="104" REF="111"/>
midst of a severe studious Life, and talk a∣gainst the Immortality of the Soul over a Dish of Coffee.</P>
<P>I would fain ask a <HI>Minute</HI> Philosopher, What Good he proposes to Mankind by the publishing of his Doctrines? Will they make a Man a bet∣ter Citizen, or Father of a Family; a more en∣dearing Husband, Friend, or Son? Will they en∣large his publick or private Virtues, or correct any of his Frailties or Vices? What is there ei∣ther joyful or glorious in such Opinions? Do they either refresh or enlarge our Thoughts? Do they contribute to the Happiness, or raise the Dignity of Humane Nature? The only Good that I have ever heard pretended to, is, That they banish Terrors, and set the Mind at Ease. But whose Terrors do they banish? It is certain, if there were any Strength in their Arguments, they would give great Disturbance to Minds that are influenc'd by Virtue, Honour, and Mora∣lity, and take from us the only Comforts and Supports of Affliction, Sickness, and Old Age. The Minds therefore which they set at Ease, are only those of impenitent Criminals and Male∣factors, and which, to the Good of Mankind, should be in perpetual Terror and Alarm.</P>
<P>I must confess, nothing is more usual than for a Free-Thinker, in Proportion as the Insolence of Scepticism is abated in him by Years and Know∣ledge, or humbled and beaten down by Sorrow or Sickness, to reconcile himself to the general Conceptions of reasonable Creatures; so that we frequently see the Apostates turning from their Revolt toward the End of their Lives, and employing the Refuse of their Parts in promoting those Truths which they had before endeavoured to invalidate.</P>
<P>The History of a Gentleman in <HI>France</HI> is very well known, who was so zealous a Promoter of
<PB N="105" REF="112"/>
Infidelity, that he had got together a select Com∣pany of Disciples, and travelled into all Parts of the Kingdom to make Converts. In the Midst of his fantastical Success he fell sick, and was reclaimed to such a Sense of his Condition, that after he had passed some Time in great Agonies and Horrors of Mind, he begged those who had the Care of burying him, to dress his Body in the Habit of a Capuchin, that the Devil might not run away with it. And to do further Justice upon himself, desired 'em to tie an Halter about his Neck, as a Mark of that ignominious Punishment, which in his own Thoughts he had so justly deserved.</P>
<P>I would not have Persecution so far disgraced, as to wish these Vermin might be animadverted on by any Legal Penalties; tho' I think it would be highly reasonable, that those few of them who die in the Professions of their Infidelity, should have such Tokens of Infamy fixed upon them, as might distinguish those Bodies which are given up by the Owners to Oblivion and Putrefaction, from those which rest in Hope, and shall rise in Glory. But at the same Time that I am against doing them the Honour of the Notice of our Laws, which ought not to sup∣pose there are such Criminals in Being, I have often wondered, how they can be tolerated in any mixed Conversations while they are vent∣ing these absurd Opinions; and should think, that if on any such Occasion, half a Dozen of the most roburst Christians in the Company would lead one of these Gentlemen to a Pump, or convey him into a Blanket, they would do very good Service both to Church and State. I do not know how the Laws stand in this Parti∣cular; but I hope, whatever Knocks, Bangs or Thumps, might be given with such an honest Intention, would not be construed as a Breach of the Peace. I dare say, they would not be
<PB N="106" REF="113"/>
returned by the Person who receives them; for whatever these Fools may say in the Vanity of their Hearts, they are too wise to risque their Lives upon the Uncertainty of their Opinions.</P>
<P>When I was a young Man about this Town, I frequented the Ordinary of the <HI>Black-Horse</HI> in <HI>Holbourn,</HI> where the Person that usually presided at the Table was a rough old-fashioned Gentle∣man, who, according to the Custom of those Times, had been the Major and Preacher of a Regiment. It happened one Day that a noisy young Officer, bred in <HI>France,</HI> was venting some new-frangled Notions, and speaking, in the Gaiety of his Humour, against the Dispensations of Providence. The Major at first only desired him to talk more respectfully of one for whom all the Company had an Honour; but finding him run on in his Extravagance, began to repri∣mand him after a more serious Manner. Young Man, said he, do not abuse your Benefactor whilst you are eating his Bread. Consider whose Air you breathe, whose Presence you are in, and who it is that gave you the Power of that very Speech which you make use of to his Dishonour. The young Fellow, who thought to turn Mat∣ters into a Jest, asked him, if he was going to preach? But at the same Time desired him to take Care what he said when he spoke to a Man of Honour. A Man of Honour, says the Major, Thou art an Infidel and a Blasphemer, and I shall use thee as such. In short, the Quarrel ran so high, that the Major was desired to walk out. Upon their coming into the Garden, the old Fellow advised his Antagonist to consider the Place into which one Pass might drive him; but finding him grow upon him to a Degree of Scurrility, as believing the Advice proceeded from Fear; Sirrah, says he, If a Thunderbolt does not strike the dead before I come at thee, I shall not fail to chastise thee for thy Profane∣ness
<PB N="107" REF="114"/>
to thy Maker, and thy Sawciness to his Ser∣vant. Upon this he drew his Sword, and cried out with a loud Voice, <HI>The Sword of the Lord and of Gideon;</HI> which so terrified his Antagonist, that he was immediately disarmed, and thrown upon his Knees. In this Posture he begged his Life; but the Major refused to grant it, before he had asked Pardon for his Offence in a short extemporary Prayer which the old Gentleman dictated to him upon the Spot, and which his Proselyte repeated after him in the Presence of the whole Ordinary, that were now gathered about him in the Garden.</P>

He no sooner thought of this Adventure, but he began it by an amorous Epistle to the Lady, and a faithful Promise to wait upon her, at a certain Hour the next Evening, when he knew her Husband was to be absent.</P>
<P>The Letter was no sooner received, but it was communicated to the Husband, and produced no other Effect in him, than that he joined with his Wife to raise all the Mirth they could out of this fantastical Piece of Gallantry. They were so little concerned at this dangerous Man of Mode, that they plotted Ways to perplex him without hurting him. <HI>Varnish</HI> comes exactly at his Hour; and the Lady's well acted Confusion at his En∣trance, gave him Opportunity to repeat some Couplets very fit for the Occasion with very much Grace and Spirit. His Theatrical Manner of making Love was interrupted by an Alarm of the Husband's coming; and the Wife, in a per∣sonated Terror, beseeched him, If he had any Value for the Honour of a Woman that loved him, he would jump out of the Window. He did so, and fell upon Feather-Beds placed on purpose to receive him.</P>
<P><PB N="109" REF="116"/>
It is not to be conceived how great the Joy of an amorous Man is when he has suffered for his Mistress, and is never the worse for it. <HI>Varnish</HI> the next Day writ a most elegant Billet, where∣in he said all that Imagination could form upon the Occasion. He violently protested, going out of the Window was no Way terrible, but as it was going from her; with several other kind Ex∣pressions, which procured him a Second Assigna∣tion. Upon his second Visit, he was conveyed by a faithful Maid into her Bed-Chamber, and left there to expect the Arrival of her Mistress. But the Wench, according to her Instructions, ran in again to him, and locked the Door after her to keep out her Master. She had just Time enough to convey the Lover into a Chest be∣fore she admitted the Husband and his Wife into the Room.</P>
<P>You may be sure that Trunk was absolutely necessary to be open'd; but upon her Husband's ordering it, she assured him, she had taken all the Care imaginable in packing up the Things with her own Hand, and he might send the Trunk aboard as soon as he thought fit. The easie Husband believed his Wife, and the good Couple went to Bed; <HI>Varnish</HI> having the Hap∣piness to pass the Night in his Mistress's Bed-Chamber without Molestation. The Morning arose, but our Lover was not well situated to ob∣serve her Blushes; so that all we know of his Sentiments on this Occasion, is, That he heard <HI>Ballance</HI> ask for the Key, and say, he would himself go with this Chest, and have it opened before the Captain of the Ship, for the greater Safety of so valuable a Lading.</P>
<P>The Goods were hoisted away, and Mr. <HI>Bal∣lance</HI> marching by his Chest with great Care and Diligence, omitted nothing that might give his Passenger Perplexity. But to consummate all, he delivered the Chest, with strict Charge,
<PB N="110" REF="117"/>
in case they were in Danger of being taken, to throw it over-board, for there were Letters in it, the Matter of which might be of great Service to the Enemy.</P>
<P><HI>N. B.</HI> It is not thought advisable to proceed further in this Account, Mr. <HI>Varnish</HI> being just returned from his Travels, and willing to con∣ceal the Occasion of his first applying himself to the Languages.</P>

<P>This Day came in a Mail from <HI>Holland,</HI> with a Confirmation of our late Advices, That a Treaty of Peace would very suddenly be set on Foot, and that Yachts were appointed by the States to con∣vey the Ministers of <HI>France</HI> from <HI>Moerdyke</HI> to <HI>Ger∣truydenburgh,</HI> which is appointed for the Place wherein this important Negotiation is to be trans∣acted.

During the whole Winter, the Mini∣sters of <HI>France</HI> have used their utmost Skill in forming such Answers as might amuse the Allies, in Hopes of a favourable Event; either in the <HI>North,</HI> or some other Part of <HI>Europe,</HI> which might affect some Part of the Alliance too nearly to leave it in a Capacity of adhering firmly to the Interest of the whole. In all this Transaction, the <HI>French</HI> King's own Name has been as little made use of as possible: But the Season of the Year advancing too fast to admit of much longer Delays in the present Condition of <HI>France,</HI> Monsieur <HI>Torci,</HI> in the Name of the King, sent a Letter to Monsieur <HI>Petticum,</HI> where∣in he says, <HI>That the King is willing all the Preli∣minary Articles shall rest as they are during the Treaty for the</HI> 37<HI>th.</HI></P>

<P><HI>DICK Reptile</HI> and I sat this Evening later than the rest of the Club; and as some Men are better Company when only with one Friend, others when there is a large Number, I found <HI>Dick</HI> to be of the former Kind. He was bewailing to me in very just Terms, the Offences which he frequently met with in the Abuse of Speech: Some use Ten Times more Words than they need, some put in Words quite foreign to their Purpose, and others adorn their Discourses with Oaths and Blasphemies by Way of Tropes and Figures. What my good Friend started, dwelt upon me after I came Home this Evening, and led me into an Enquiry with my self, Whence should arise such strange Excrescencies in Dis∣course? Whereas it must be obvious to all rea∣sonable Beings, That the sooner a Man speaks his Mind, the more complaisant he is to the Man with whom he talks: But upon mature Delibe∣ration, I am come to this Resolution, That for One Man who speaks to be understood, there are Ten who talk only to be admired.</P>
<P>The ancient <HI>Greeks</HI> had little independent Sylla∣bles called Expletives, which they brought into their Discourses both in Verse and Prose, for no other Purpose but for the better Grace and Sound of their Sentences and Periods. I know no Ex∣ample but this which can authorise the Use of
<PB N="113" REF="120"/>
more Words than are necessary. But whether it be from this Freedom taken by that wise Nation, or however it arises, <HI>Dick Reptile</HI> hit upon a very just and common Cause of Offence in the Generality of the People of all Orders. We have one here in our Lane who speaks nothing without quoting an Authority; for it is always with him, So and so, <HI>as the Man said.</HI> He asked me this Morning, How I did? <HI>as the Man said;</HI> and hoped I would come now and then to see him, <HI>as the Man said.</HI> I am acquainted with another, who never deli∣vers himself upon any Subject, but he cries. He only speaks his <HI>poor Judgment;</HI> this is his hum∣ble Opinion; or as for his Part, if he might pre∣sume to offer any Thing on that Subject. But of all the Persons who add Elegancies and Superflui∣ties to their Discourses, those who deserve the foremost Rank, are the Swearers; and the Lump of these may, I think, be very aptly divided into the common Distinction of High and Low. Dulness and Barrenness of Thought is the Original of it in both these Sects, and they differ only in Con∣stitution: The Low is generally a phlegmatick, and the High a cholerick Coxcomb. The Man of Phlegm is sensible of the Emptiness of his Discourse, and will tell you, That <HI>Psackins,</HI> such a Thing is true: Or if you warm him a little, he may run into Passion, and cry, <HI>Odsbodikins,</HI> you do not say right. But the High affects a Sublimity in Dulness, and invokes Hell and Dam∣nation at the Breaking of a Glass, or the Slow∣ness of a Drawer.</P>
<P>I was the other Day trudging along <HI>Fleetstreet</HI> on Foot, and an old Army-Friend came up with me. We were both going towards <HI>Westminster,</HI> and finding the Streets were so crowded that we could not keep together, we resolved to club for a Coach. This Gentleman I knew to be the First of the Order of the Cholerick. I must con∣fess, (were there no Crime in it) nothing could
<PB N="114" REF="121"/>
be more diverting than the Impertinence of the High Juror: For whether there is Remedy or not against what offends him, still he is to show he is offended; and he must sure not omit to be magnificently passionate, by falling on all Things in his Way. We were stopped by a Train of Coaches at <HI>Temple-Bar.</HI> What the Devil! (says my Companion) cannot you drive on Coachman? D—n you all, for a Set of Sons of Whores, you will stop here to be paid by the Hour! There is not such a Set of confounded Dogs as the Coachmen unhang'd! But these rascally Cits—'Ounds, why should not there be a Tax to make these Dogs widen their Gates? Oh! but the Hell-hounds move at last. Ay, said I, I knew you wou'd make 'em whip on if once they heard you—No, says he; but would it not fret a Man to the De∣vil, to pay for being carried slower than he can walk. Lookee, there is for ever a Stop at this Hole by St. <HI>Clement</HI>'s Church. Blood, you Dog!—Harkee, Sirrah,—Why, and be d—n'd to you, do not you drive over that Fellow?—Thunder, Furies, and Damnation! I'll cut your Ears off, you Fellow before there.—Come hither, you Dog you, and let me ring your Neck round your Shoulders. We had a Repetition of the same Eloquence at the <HI>Cockpit,</HI> and the Turning into <HI>Palace-Yard.</HI></P>
<P>This gave me a perfect Image of the Insignifi∣cancy of the Creatures who practise this Enor∣mity; and made me conclude, That it is ever Want of Sense makes a Man guilty in this Kind. It was excellently well said, That this Folly had no Temptation to excuse it, no Man being born of a Swearing Constitution. In a Word, a few rumbling Words and Consonants clapped toge∣ther, without any Sense, will make an accom∣plished Swearer: And it is needless to dwell long upon this Blustring Impertinence, which is already banished out of the Society of well-bred

<P>There arrived a Messenger last Night from <HI>Har∣wich,</HI> who left that Place just as the Duke of <HI>Marlborough</HI> was going on board. The Character of this important General going out by the Com∣mand of his Queen, and at the Request of his Country, put me in Mind of that noble Figure which <HI>Shakespear</HI> gives <HI>Harry</HI> the Fifth upon his Expedition against <HI>France.</HI> The Poet wishes for Abilities to represent so great an Hero.</P>
<Q><L>Oh for a Muse of Fire! <HI>[says he]</HI></L>

<P><HI>Shakespear</HI> understood the Force of this parti∣cular Allegory so well, that he had it in his Thoughts in another Passage, which is altogether as Daring and Sublime as the former.

<P>IT is an Argument of a clear and worthy. Spi∣rit in a Man, to be able to disengage himself from the Opinions of others, so far as not to let the Deference due to the Sense of Mankind in∣snare him to act against the Dictates of his own Reason. But the Generality of the World are so far from walking by any such Maxim, that it is almost a standing Rule to do as others do, or be ridiculous. I have heard my old Friend Mr. <HI>Hart</HI> speak it as an Observation among the Players, That it is impossible to act with Grace, except the Actor has forgot that he is before an Audience. Till he has arrived at that, his Motion, his Air, his every Step and Gesture, has something in them which discovers he is under a Restraint for Fear of being ill received; or if he considers himself as in the Presence of those who approve his Behaviour, you see an Affectation of that Pleasure run through his whole Carriage. It is as common in Life, as upon the Stage, to behold a Man in the most indifferent Action betray a Sense he has of doing what he is about gracefully. Some have such an immoderate Relish for Ap∣plause, that they expect it for Things, which in themselves are so frivolous, that it is impossible, without this Affectation, to make them appear worthy either of Blame or Praise. There is <HI>Will Glare,</HI> so passionately intent upon being admired,
<PB N="118" REF="125"/>
that when you see him in publick Places, every Muscle of his Face discovers his Thoughts are fixed upon the Consideration of what Figure he makes. He will often fall into a musing Posture to attract Observation, and is then obtruding himself upon the Company when he pretends to be withdrawn from it. Such little Arts are the certain and infallible Tokens of a superficial Mind, as the avoiding Observation is the Sign of a great and sublime one. It is therefore extreme∣ly difficult for a Man to judge even of his own Actions, without forming to himself an Idea of what he should act, were it in his Power to exe∣cute all his Desires without the Observation of the rest of the World. There is an Allegorical Fable in <HI>Plato,</HI> which seems to admonish us, That we are very little acquainted with our selves, while we know our Actions are to pass the Cen∣sures of others; but had we the Power to accom∣plish all our Wishes unobserved, we should then easily inform our selves how far we are possessed of Real and Intrinsick Virtue. The Fable I was go∣ing to mention, is that of <HI>Gyges,</HI> who is said to have had an inchanted Ring, which had in it a miraculous Quality, making him who wore it visible or invisible, as he turned it to or from his Body. The Use <HI>Gyges</HI> made of his occasional In∣visibility, was, by the Advantage of it, to vio∣late a Queen, and murder a King. <HI>Tully</HI> takes Notice of this Allegory, and says very handsom∣ly, That a Man of Honour who had such a Ring, would act just in the same Manner as he would do without it. It is indeed no small Pitch of Virtue under the Temptation of Impunity, and the Hopes of accomplishing all a Man's Desires, not to transgress the Rules of Justice and Virtue; but this is rather not being an ill Man, than be∣ing positively a good one; and it seems wonder∣ful, that so great a Soul as that of <HI>Tully,</HI> should not form to himself a Thousand worthy Actions
<PB N="119" REF="126"/>
which a virtuous Mind would be prompted to by the Possession of such a Secret. There are cer∣tainly some Part of Mankind who are Guardian Beings to the other. <HI>Sallust</HI> could say of <HI>Cato, That he had rather be than appear good;</HI> but in∣deed, this Eulogium rose no higher than (as I just now hinted) to an Inoffensiveness, rather than an active Virtue. Had it occurred to the noble Ora∣tor to represent, in his Language, the glorious Pleasures of a Man secretly employed in Benefi∣cence and Generosity, it would certainly have made a more charming Page than any he has now left behind him. How might a Man, fur∣nished with <HI>Gyges</HI>'s Secret, employ it in bringing together distant Friends, laying Snares for crea∣ting Good-will in the room of groundless Hatred; in removing the Pangs of an unjust Jealousy, the Shyness of an imperfect Reconciliation, and the Tremor of an awful Love? Such a one could give Confidence to bashful Merit, and Confusion to over-bearing Impudence.</P>
<P>Certain it is, That secret Kindnesses done to Mankind, are as beautiful as secret Injuries are detestable. To be invisibly good, is as God-like, as to be invisibly ill, Diabolical. As degenerate as we are apt to say the Age we live in is, there are still amongst us Men of illustrious Minds, who enjoy all the Pleasures of good Actions, except that of being commended for them. There happens among others very worthy Instan∣ces of a publick Spirit, one of which I am obli∣ged to discover, because I know not otherwise how to obey the Commands of the Benefactor. A Citizen of <HI>London</HI> has given Directions to Mr. <HI>Rainer,</HI> the Writing Master of <HI>Paul</HI>'s School, to educate at his Charge Ten Boys (who shall be nominated by me) in Writing and Accompts, till they shall be fit for any Trade. I desire there∣fore such as know any proper Objects for re∣ceiving this Bounty, to give Notice thereof to
<PB N="120" REF="127"/>
Mr. <HI>Morphew,</HI> or Mr. <HI>Lillie,</HI> and they shall, if properly qualified, have Instructions accordingly.</P>
<P>Actions of this Kind have in them something so transcendent, that it is an Injury to applaud them, and a Diminution of that Merit which consists in shunning our Approbation. We shall therefore leave them to enjoy that glorious Ob∣scurity, and silently admire their Virtue, who can contemn the most delicious of Humane Plea∣sures, that of receiving due Praise. Such Cele∣stial Dispositions very justly suspend the Dis∣covery of their Benefactions, till they come where their Actions cannot be misinterpreted, and receive their first Congratulations in the Com∣pany of Angels.</P>

<P>WHEN I reflect upon the many Nights I have sat up for some Months last past in the greatest Anxiety for the Good of my Neigh∣bours and Contemporaries, it is no small Discou∣ragement to me, to see how slow a Progress I make in the Reformation of the World. But in∣deed I must do my Female Readers the Justice to own, that their tender Hearts are much more susceptible of good Impressions, than the Minds of the other Sex. Business and Ambition take up Men's Thoughts too much to leave Room for Philosophy: But if you speak to Women in a Style and Manner proper to approach them, they never fail to improve by your Counsel. I shall therefore for the future turn my Thoughts more particularly to their Service, and study the best Methods to adorn their Persons, and inform their Minds in the justest Methods to make them what
<PB N="122" REF="129"/>
Nature designed them, the most beauteous Ob∣jects of our Eyes, and the most agreeable Com∣panions of our Lives. But when I say this, I must not omit at the same Time to look into their Errors and Mistakes, that being the readiest Way to the intended End of adorning and in∣structing them. It must be acknowledged, That the very Inadvertencies of this Sex are owing to the other; for if Men were not Flatterers, Wo∣men could not fall into that general Cause of all their Follies, and our Misfortunes, their Love of Flattery. Were the Commendation of these a∣greeable Creatures built upon its proper Founda∣tion, the higher we raised their Opinion of them∣selves, the greater would be the Advantage to our Sex; but all the Topick of Praise is drawn from very senseless and extravagant Idea's we pretend we have of their Beauty and Perfection. Thus when a young Man falls in Love with a young Woman, from that Moment she is no more Mrs. <HI>Alice</HI> such a one, born of such a Fa∣ther, and educated by such a Mother, but from the first Minute that he cast his Eye upon her with Desire, he conceives a Doubt in his Mind, What Heavenly Power gave so unexpected a Blow to an Heart that was ever before untouched. But who can resist Fate and Destiny, which are lodged in Mrs. <HI>Alice</HI>'s Eyes? After which he de∣sires Orders accordingly, Whether he is to live or breath; the Smile or Frown of his Goddess is the only Thing that can now either save or de∣stroy him. By this Means, the well-humoured Girl, that would have romped with him before she received this Declaration, assumes a State suitable to the Majesty he has given her, and treats him as the Vassal he calls himself. The Girl's Head is immediately turned by having the Power of Life and Death, and takes Care to suit every Motion and Air to her new Sovereignty. After he has placed himself at this Distance, he
<PB N="123" REF="130"/>
must never hope to recover his former Familiarity, till she has had the Addresses of another, and found them less sincere.</P>
<P>If the Application to Women were justly turn∣ed, the Address of Flattery, tho' it implied at the same Time an Admonition, would be much more likely to succeed. Should a captivated Lover, in a Billet, let his Mistress know, That her Piety to her Parents, her Gentleness of Behaviour, her prudent Oeconomy with respect to her own lit∣tle Affairs in a Virgin Condition, had improved the Passion which her Beauty had inspired him with, into so settled an Esteem for her, that of all Women breathing he wished her his Wifes tho' his commending her for Qualities she knew she had as a Virgin, would make her believe he expected from her an answerable Conduct in the Character of a Matron: I will answer for it, his Suit would be carried on with less Perplexity.</P>
<P>Instead of this, the Generality of our young Women, taking all their Notions of Life from gay Writings, or Letters of Love, consider them∣selves as Goddesses, Nymphs, and Shepherdes∣ses.</P>
<P>By this Romantick Sense of Things, all the na∣tural Relations and Duties of Life are forgotten, and our Female Part of Mankind are bred and treated, as if they were designed to inhabit the happy Fields of <HI>Arcadia,</HI> rather than be Wives and Mothers in old <HI>England.</HI> It is indeed long since I had the Happiness to converse familiarly with this Sex, and therefore have been fearful of falling into the Error which recluse Men are very subject to, that of giving false Representa∣tions of the World from which they have retired, by imaginary Schemes drawn from their own Re∣flections. An old Man cannot easily gain Admit∣tance into the Dressing-room of Ladies; I therefore thought it Time well spent, to turn over <HI>Agrippa,</HI> and use all my occult Art, to give my old Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣nelian

Ring the same Force with that of <HI>Gyges,</HI> which I have lately spoken of. By the Help of this, I went unobserved to a Friend's House of mine, and followed the Chamber-maid invisibly about Twelve of the Clock into the Bed-chamber of the beauteous <HI>Flavia,</HI> his Fine Daughter, just before she got up.</P>
<P>I drew the Curtains, and being wrapped up in the Safety of my old Age, could with much Pleasure, without Passion, behold her sleeping with <HI>Waller</HI>'s Poems, and a Letter fixed in that Part of him, where every Woman thinks her self described. The Light flashing upon her Face, awakened her: She opened her Eyes, and her Lips too, repeating that Piece of false Wit in that admired Poet;</P>
<Q><L>Such <HI>Helen</HI> was, And who can blame the Boy,</L>
<L>That in so bright a Flame consum'd his <HI>Troy?</HI></L></Q>
<P>This she pronounced with a most bewitching Sweetness; but after it fetched a Sigh, that me∣thought had more Desire than Languishment, then took out her Letter, and read aloud, for the Pleasure, I suppose, of hearing soft Words in Praise of her self, the following Epistle:</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Madam,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Sat near you at the Opera last Night; but knew no Entertainment from the vain Show and Noise about me, while I waited wholly intent upon the Motion of your Bright Eyes, in Hopes of a Glance, that might restore me to the Pleasures of Sight and Hearing in the midst of Beauty and Harmony. It is said, the Hell of the Accursed in the next Life, arises from an Incapacity to partake the Joys of the Blessed, though they were to be admitted to them. Such I am sure was my Condition all this Evening; and if you, my Deity, cannot have so much Mercy, as to make me by your Influence capable of tasting
<PB N="125" REF="132"/>
the Satisfactions of Life, my Being is ended, which consisted only in your Favour.</P>
</LETTER>
<P>The Letter was hardly read over, when she rush'd out of Bed in her Wrapping-Gown, and consulted her Glass for the Truth of his Passion. She raised her Head, and turned it to a Profile, repeating the last Lines, <HI>My Being is ended, which consisted only in your Favour.</HI> The Goddess imme∣diately called her Maid, and fell to dressing that mischievous Face of hers, without any Manner of Consideration for the Mortal who had offered up his Petition. Nay, it was so far otherwise, that the whole Time of her Woman's combing her Hair was spent in Discourse of the Imper∣tinence of his Passion, and ended, in declaring a Resolution, if she ever had him, to make him wait. She also frankly told the Favourite Gypsy that was prating to her, that her passionate Lo∣ver had put it out of her Power to be civil to him, if she were inclined to it; for (said she) if I am thus Coelestial to my Lover, he will cer∣tainly so far think himself disappointed, as I grow into the Familiarity and Form of a mortal Woman.</P>
<P>I came away as I went in, without staying for other Remarks than what confirmed me in the Opinion, That it is from the Notions the Men inspire them with, that the Women are so fanta∣stical in the Value of themselves. This ima∣ginary Pre-eminence which is given to the Fair Sex, is not only form'd from the Addresses of People of Condition; but it is the Fashion and Humour of all Orders to go regularly out of their Wits, as soon as they begin to make Love. I know at this Time Three Goddesses in the <HI>New-Exchange;</HI> and there are Two Shepherdesses that sell Gloves in <HI>Westminster-Hall.</HI></P>

<P>I am to tell this Gentleman in sober Sadness, and without Jest, That there really is so good and charitable a Man as the Benefactor enquired for in his Letter, and that there are but Two Boys yet named. The Father of one of them was killed at <HI>Bleinheim,</HI> the Father of the other at <HI>Almanza.</HI> I do not here give the Names of the Children, because I should take it to be an Insolence in me to publish them, in a Charity which I have only the Direction of as a Servant, to that worthy and generous Spirit who bestows upon them this Bounty, without laying the Bon∣dage of an Obligation. What I have to do is to tell them, they are beholden only to their Maker, to kill in them as they grow up the false Shame of Poverty, and let them know, That their present Fortune, which is come upon them by the Loss of their poor Fathers on so glorious Occasions, is much more honourable, than the Inheritance of the most ample ill-gotten Wealth.</P>

<P>HAving a Daughter about Nine Years of Age, I would endeavour she might have Education; I mean such as may be useful, as working well, and a good Deportment. In order to it, I am persuaded to place her at some Boarding-School, situate in a good Air. My Wife opposes it, and gives for her greatest Reason, That she is too much a Woman, and understands the Formalities of Visiting and a Tea-Table so very nicely, that none, tho' much older, can exceed her; and with all these Perfections, the Girl can scarce thread a

<P>YOUR Notice in the Advertisement in your <HI>Tatler</HI> of <HI>Saturday</HI> last about <HI>Whet∣ters</HI> in and about the <HI>Royal-Exchange,</HI> is migh∣tily taken Notice of by Gentlemen who use the Coffee-houses near the <HI>Chancery-Office</HI> in <HI>Chan∣cery-Lane;</HI> and there being a particular cer∣tain Set of both young and old Gentlemen that belong to and near adjoining to the <HI>Chan∣cery-Office,</HI> both in <HI>Chancery-Lane</HI> and <HI>Bell-Yard,</HI> that are not only <HI>Whetters</HI> all the Morning long, but very Musically given about Twelve at Night the same Days, and mightily taken with the Union of the Dulcimer, Violin, and Song; at which Recreation they rejoice together with

<P>These <HI>Whetters</HI> are a People I have considered with much Pains, aad find them to differ from a Sect I have heretofore spoken of, called <HI>Snuff-Takers,</HI> only in the Expedition they take in de∣stroying their Brains: The <HI>Whetter</HI> is obliged to refresh himself every Moment with a Liquor, as the <HI>Snuff Taker</HI> with a Powder. As for their Harmony in the Evening, I have nothing to ob∣ject, provided they remove to <HI>Wapping</HI> or the <HI>Bridge-Foot,</HI> where it is not to be supposed that their Vociferations will annoy the Studious, the Busie, or the Contemplative. I once had Lodg∣ings in <HI>Grays-Inn,</HI> where we had two hard Stu∣dents, who learned to play upon the Hautboy; and I had a Couple of Chamber-Fellows over my Head not less diligent in the Practice of Back-Sword and Single-Rapier. I remember these Gentlemen were assigned by the Benchers the Two Houses at the End of the Terras-Walk, as the only Places sit for their Meditations. Such Students as will let none improve but them∣selves, ought indeed to have their proper Di∣stances from Societies.</P>
<P>The Gentlemen of loud Mirth above-men∣tioned I take to be, in the Quality of their Crime, the same as Eves-Droppers; for they who will be in your Company whether you will or no, are to as great a Degree Offen∣ders, as they who hearken to what passes with∣out being of your Company at all. The ancient Punishment for the latter, when I first came to
<PB N="134" REF="141"/>
this Town, was the Blanket, which I humbly conceive may be as justly applied to him that bawls, as to him that listens. It is therefore provided for the future, That (except in the long Vacation) no Retainers to the Law, with Dulcimer, Violin, or any other Instrument, in any Tavern within a Furlong of an Inn of Court, shall sing any Tune, or pretended Tune whatso∣ever, upon Pain of the Blanker, to be admini∣stred according to the Discretion of all such peaceable People as shall be within the Annoy∣ance. And it is further directed, That all Clerks who shall offend in this Kind shall forfeit their Indentures, and be turned over as Assistants to the Clerks of Parishes within the Bills of Mortality, who are hereby empowered to de∣mand them accordingly.</P>
<P>I am not to omit the Receipt of the following Letter, with a Nightcap, from my Valentine; which Nightcap I find was finished in the Year 1588, and is too finely wrought to be of any mo∣dern Stitching. Its Antiquity will better appear by my Valentine's own Words.</P>

<P>ALL Persons who employ themselves in Pub∣lick, are still interrupted in the Course of their Affairs: And it seems, the admired Cavalier <HI>Nicolini</HI> himself is commanded by the Ladies, who at present employ their Time with great Assiduity in the Care of the Nation, to put off his Day till he shall receive their Commands, and Notice that they are at Leisure for Diversions. In the mean Time it is not to be expressed, how many cold Chickens the Fair Ones have eaten since this Day Seven-night for the Good of their Country. This great Occasion has given Birth to many Discoveries of high Moment for the Conduct of Life. There is a Toast of my Ac∣quaintance told me, She had now found out, that it was Day before Nine in the Morning; and I am very confident, if the Affair holds many Days longer, the Ancient Hours of Eating will be revived among us, many having by it been made acquainted with the Luxury of Hunger and Thirst.</P>
<P>There appears, methinks, something very vene∣rable in all Assemblies: And I must confess, I en∣vied all who had Youth and Health enough to make their Appearance there, that they had the Happiness of being a whole Day in the best Company in the World. During the Adjourn∣ments of that awful Court, a Neighbour of mine was telling me, That it gave him a Notion of the ancient Grandeur of the <HI>English</HI> Hospita∣lity,

<P>But since Age and Infirmities forbid my Ap∣pearance at such publick Places, the next Hap∣piness is to make the best Use of Privacy, and acquit my self of the Demands of my Corres∣pondents. The following Letter is what has given me no small Inquietude, it being an Ac∣cusation of Partiality, and Disregard to Merit, in the Person of a Vertuoso, who is the most elo∣quent of all Men upon small Occasions, and is the more to be admired for his prodigious Ferti∣lity of Invention, which never appears but upon Subjects which others would have thought bar∣ren. But in Consideration of his uncommon Talents, I am contented to let him be the Hero of my next Two Days, by inserting his Friend's Recommendation of him at large.</P>

<P>I Am just come out of the Country, and up∣on perusing your late Lucubrations, I find <HI>Charles Lillie</HI> to be the Darling of your Affe∣ctions, that you have give him a Place, and taken no small Pains to establish him in the World; and at the same Time <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ave passed by his Name-sake at this End of the Town, as if he was a Citizen defunct, and one of no Use in a Commonwealth. I must own, his Cir∣cumstances are so good, and so well known, that he does not stand in Need of having his Fame published to the World; but being of an ambitious Spirit, and an aspiring Soul, he would be rather proud of the Honour, than de∣sirous of the Profit, which might result from your Recommendation. He is a Person of a
<PB N="138" REF="145"/>
particular Genius, the First that brought Toys in Fashion, and Bawbles to Perfection. He is admirably well versed in Screws, Springs, and Hinges, and deeply read in Knives, Combs or Scissars, Buttons or Buckles. He is a perfect Master of Words, which uttered with a smooth voluble Tongue, flow into a most persuasive Eloquence; insomuch that I have known a Gentleman of Distinction find several ingenious Faults with a Toy of his, and shew his utmost Dislike to it, as being either useless, or ill con∣trived; but when the Orator behind the Counter had harangued upon it for an Hour and a half, display'd its hidden Beauties, and revealed its secret Perfections, he has wondered how he had been able to spend so great a Part of his Life without so important an Utensil. I won't pretend to furnish out an Inventory of all the valuable Commodities that are to be found at his Shop.</P>
<P>I shall content my self with giving an Ac∣count of what I think most curious. <HI>Imprimis,</HI> his Pocket-Books are very neat, and well con∣trived, not for keeping <HI>Bank</HI> Bills or Gold∣smiths Notes, I confess; but they are admira∣ble for registring the Lodgings of <HI>Madona</HI>'s, and for preserving Letters from Ladies of Quality. His Whips and Spurs are so nice, that they'll make one that buys them ride a Fox-hunting, tho' before he hated Noise and early Rising, and was afraid of breaking his Neck. His Seals are curiously fancied, and exquisitely well cut, and of great Use to encourage young Gentlemen to write a good Hand. <HI>Ned Puzzle∣post</HI> had been ill used by his Writing-Master, and writ a Sort of a <HI>Chinese,</HI> or downright <HI>Scrawlian:</HI> However, upon his buying a Seal of my Friend, he is so much improved by con∣tinual Writing, that it is believed in a short Time one may be able to read his Letters, and
<PB N="139" REF="146"/>
find out his Meaning, without guessing.

Indeed his Canes are so finely clouded, and so well made up, either with Gold or Amber-Heads, that I am of the Opinion 'tis impossible for a Gentleman to walk, talk, sit, or stand as he should do, without one of them. He knows the Value of a Cane, by knowing the Value of the Buyer's Estate. Sir <HI>Timothy Shallow</HI> has Two Thousand Pounds <HI>per Annum,</HI> and <HI>Tom. Empty</HI> One. They both at several Times bought a Cane of <HI>Charles:</HI> Sir <HI>Timothy</HI>'s cost Ten Guinea's, and <HI>Tom. Empty</HI>'s Five. Upon comparing them, they were perfectly alike. Sir <HI>Timothy</HI> surprised there should be no Dif∣ference in the Canes, and so much in the Price, comes to <HI>Charles.</HI> Damn it, <HI>Charles,</HI> says he, you have sold me a Cane here for Ten Pieces, and the very same to <HI>Tom.

<P>I Was this Afternoon surprised with a Visit from my Sister <HI>Jenny,</HI> after an Absence of some Time. She had, methought, in her Manner and Air, something that was a little below that of the Women of first Breeding and Quality, but at the same Time above the Simplicity and Familiarity of her usual Deportment. As soon as she was seated, she began to talk to me of the odd Place
<PB N="141" REF="148"/>
I lived in, and begged of me to remove out of the Lane where I have been so long acquainted; for (said she) it does so spoil one's Horses, that I must beg your Pardon if you see me much seldom∣er, when I am to make so great a Journey with a single Pair, and make Visits and get Home the same Night. I understood her pretty well, but would not; therefore desired her to pay off her Coach, for I had a great deal to talk to her. She very pertly told me, She came in her own Chariot. Why, said I, is your Husband in Town? And has he set up an Equipage? No, answered she, but I have received 500 <HI>l.</HI> by his Order; and his Letters, which came at the same Time, bad me want for nothing that was necessary. I was heartily concerned at her Folly, whose Affairs render her but just able to bear such an Expence. However I considered, that according to the <HI>Bri∣tish</HI> Custom of treating Women, there is no other Method to be used in removing any of their Faults and Errors, but conducting their Minds from one Humour to another, with as much Ce∣remony as we lead their Persons from one Place to another. I therefore dissembled my Concern, and in Compliance with her, as a Lady that was to use her Feet no more, I begged of her, after a short Visit, to let me persuade her not to stay out till it was late, for fear of catching Cold as she went into her Coach in the Dampness of the Evening. The <HI>Malapert</HI> knew well enough I laughed at her, but was not ill pleased with the Certainty of her Power over her Husband, who, she knew, would support her in any Humour he was able, rather than pass through the Torment of an Expostulation, to gainsay any Thing she had a Mind to. As soon as my fine Lady was gone, I writ the following Letter to my Bro∣ther.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Brother,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Am at present under very much Concern at the splendid Appearance I saw my Sister make in an Equipage which she has set up in your Absence. I beg of you not to indulge her in this Vanity; and desire you to consi∣der, the World is so whimsical, that though it will value you for being happy, it will hate you for appearing so. The Possession of Wisdom and Virtue (the only solid Distinctions of Life) is allowed much more easily than that of Wealth and Quality. Besides which, I must intreat you to weigh with your self, What it is that People aim at in setting themselves out to Show in gay Equipages, and moderate Fortunes? You are not by this Means a better Man than your Neighbour is; but your Horses are better than his are. And will you suffer Care and Inquietude, to have it said as you pass by, Those are very pretty punch Nags? Nay, when you have arrived at this, there are a Hundred worth∣less Fellows who are still Four Horses happier than you are. Remember, dear Brother, there is a certain Modesty in the Enjoyment of mo∣derate Wealth, which to transgress, exposes Men to the utmost Derision; and as there is nothing but Meanness of Spirit can move a Man to value himself upon what can be purchased with Mo∣ney, so he that shows an Ambition that Way, and cannot arrive at it, is more emphatically guilty of that Meanness. I give you only my first Thoughts on this Occasion, but shall, as I am a Censor, entertain you in my next with my Sentiments in general upon the Subject of Equi∣page; and show, that tho' there are no sump∣tuary Laws amongst us, Reason and good Sense are equally binding, and will ever prevail in ap∣pointing Approbation or Dislike in all Matters

<P>IN a Nation of Liberty, there is hardly a Per∣son in the whole Mass of the People more ab∣solutely necessary than a Censor. It is allowed, that I have no Authority for assuming this impor∣tant Appellation, and that I am Censor of these Nations, just as one is chosen King at the Game of Questions and Commands: But if, in the Exe∣cution of this fantastical Dignity, I observe upon Things which do not fall within the Cognizance of real Authority, I hope it will be granted, that an idle Man could not be more usefully employed. Among all the Irregularities of which I have ta∣ken Notice, I know none so proper to be present∣ed to the World by a Censor, as that of the gene∣ral Expence and Affectation in Equipage. I have lately hinted, that this Extravagance must neces∣sarily get Footing where we have no sumptuary Laws, and where every Man may be dressed, at∣tended, and carried, in what Manner he pleases. But my Tenderness to my Fellow Subjects will not permit me to let this Enormity go unob∣served.</P>
<P><PB N="146" REF="153"/>
As the Matter now stands, every Man takes it in his Head, that he has a Liberty to spend his Money as he pleases. Thus, in Spight of all Order, Justice, and Decorum, we the greater Number of the Queen's loyal Subjects, for no Reason in the World but because we want Money, do not share alike in the Division of Her Majesty's High-Road. The Horses and Slaves of the Rich take up the whole Street, while we Peripateticks are very glad to watch an Opportunity to whisk cross a Pas∣sage, very thankful that we are not run over for interrupting the Machine, that carries in it a Per∣son neither more handsome, wise, or valiant than the Meanest of us. For this Reason, were I to propose a Tax, it should certainly be upon Coaches and Chairs: For no Man living can as∣sign a Reason, why one Man should have half a Street to carry him at his Ease, and perhaps only in Pursuit of Pleasures, when as good a Man as himself wants Room for his own Person to pass upon the most necessary and urgent Occasion. Till such an Acknowledgment is made to the Pub∣lick, I shall take upon me to vest certain Rights in the Scavengers of the Cities of <HI>London</HI> and <HI>West∣minster,</HI> to take the Horses and Servants of all such as do not become or deserve such Distinctions into their peculiar Custody. The Offenders them∣selves I shall allow safe Conduct to their Places of Abode in the Carts of the said Scavengers, but their Horses shall be mounted by their Footmen, and sent into the Service Abroad: And I take this Opportunity in the first Place to recruit the Regiment of my good old Friend the brave and honest <HI>Sylvius,</HI> that they be as well taught as they are fed. It is to me most miraculous, so unrea∣sonable an Usurpation as this I am speaking of should so long have been tolerated. We hang a poor Fellow for taking any trifle from us on the Road, and bear with the Rich for robbing us of the Road it self. Such a Tax as this, would be of
<PB N="147" REF="154"/>
great Satisfaction to us who walk on Foot; and since the Distinction of riding in a Coach is not to be appointed according to a Man's Merit or Ser∣vice to their Country, nor that Liberty given as a Reward for some eminent Virtue, we should be highly contented to see them pay something for the Insult they do us in the State they take upon them while they are drawn by us.</P>
<P>'Till they have made us some Reparation of this Kind, we the Peripateticks of <HI>Great Britain</HI> can∣not think our selves well treated, while every one that is able is allowed to set up an Equipage.</P>
<P>As for my Part, I cannot but admire how Per∣sons, conscious to themselves of no Manner of Superiority above others, can out of meer Pride or Laziness expose themselves at this Rate to pub∣lick View, and put us all upon pronouncing those Three terrible Syllables, Who is that? When it comes to that Question, our Method is to consi∣der the Mien and Air of the Passenger, and com∣fort our selves for being dirty to the Ankles, by laughing at his Figure and Appearance who over∣looks us. I must confess, were it not for the so∣lid Injustice of the Thing, there is nothing could afford a discerning Eye greater Occasion for Mirth, than this licentious Huddle of Qualities and Characters in the Equipages about this Town. The Overseers of the Highway and Constables have so little Skill or Power to rectify this Mat¦ter, that you may often see the Equipage of a Fel∣low whom all the Town knows to deserve hang∣ing, make a Stop that shall interrupt the Lord High Chancellor and all the Judges in their Way to <HI>Westminster.</HI></P>
<P>For the better understanding of Things and Per∣sons in this general Confusion, I have given Di∣rections to all the Coach-Makers and Coach-Painters in Town, to bring me in Lists of their several Customers; and doubt not, but with com∣paring the Orders of each Man, in the placing his
<PB N="148" REF="155"/>
Arms on the Doors of his Chariot, as well as the Words, Devices and Cyphers to be fix'd upon them, to make a Collection which shall let us into the Nature, if not the History, of Mankind, more usefully than the Curiosities of any Medal∣list in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>But this Evil of Vanity in our Figure, with many others, proceeds from a certain Gaie∣ty of Heart, which has crept into Men's very Thoughts and Complexions. The Passions and Adventures of Hero's, when they enter the Lists for the Tournament in Romances, are not more easily distinguishable by their Palfreys and their Armour, than the secret Springs and Affections of the several Pretenders to Show amongst us are known by their Equipages in ordinary Life. The young Bridegroom with his gilded Cupids, and winged Angels, has some Excuse in the Joy of his Heart to launch out into something that may be significant of his present Happiness: But to see Men, for no Reason upon Earth but that they are rich, ascend Triumphant Chariots, and ride thro' the People, has at the Bottom nothing else in it but an insolent Transport, arising only from the Distinction of Fortune.</P>
<P>It is therefore high Time that I call in such Coaches as are in their Embellishments improper for the Character of their Owners. But if I find I am not obeyed herein, and that I cannot pull down these Equipages already erected, I shall take upon me to prevent the Growth of this Evil for the future, by enquiring into the Pretensions of the Persons who shall hereafter attempt to make publick Entries with Ornaments and Decorations of their own Appointment. If a Man, who be∣lieved he had the handsomest Leg in this King∣dom, should take a Fancy to adorn so deserving a Limb with a blue Garter, he would justly be punished for offending against the Most Noble Order: And, I think, the general Prostitution
<PB N="149" REF="156"/>
of Equipage and Retinue is as destructive to all Distinction, as the Impertinence of one Man, if permitted, would certainly be to that illustrious Fraternity.</P>

<P>THIS Evening was allotted for taking into Consideration a late Request of two indul∣gent Parents, touching the Care of a young Daughter, whom they design to send to a Board∣ing-School, or keep at Home, according to my Determination; but I am diverted from that Sub∣ject by Letters which I have received from seve∣ral Ladies, complaining of a certain Sect of pro∣fessed Enemies to the Repose of the Fair Sex, cal∣led Oglers. These are, it seems, Gentlemen who look with deep Attention on one Object at the
<PB N="150" REF="157"/>
Play-houses, and are ever staring all round them in Churches. It is urged by my Correspondents, that they do all that is possible to keep their Eyes off these Insnarers; but that, by what Power they know not, both their Diversions and Devo∣tions are interrupted by them in such a Manner, as that they cannot attend either, without stealing Looks at the Persons whose Eyes are fixed upon them. By this Means, my Petitioners say, they find themselves grow insensibly less offended, and in Time enamoured, of these their Enemies. What is required of me on this Occasion, is, That as I love and study to preserve the better Part of Man∣kind, the Females, I would give them some Ac∣count of this dangerous Way of Assault, against which there is so little Defence, that it lays Am∣bush for the Sight it self, and makes them see∣ingly, knowingly, willingly, and forcibly go on to their own Captivity.</P>
<P>This Representation of the present State of Af∣fairs between the Two Sexes gave me very much Alarm; and I had no more to do, but to recollect what I had seen at any one Assembly for some Years last past, to be convinced of the Truth and Justice of this Remonstrance. If there be not a Stop put to this evil Art, all the Modes of Address, and the elegant Embellishments of Life, which arise out of the noble Passion of Love, will of Ne∣cessity decay. Who would be at the Trouble of Rhetorick, or study the <HI>Bon Mien,</HI> when his Intro∣duction is so much easier obtained, by a sudden Reverence in a downcast Look at the meeting the Eye of a Fair Lady, and beginning again to ogle her as soon as she glances another Way? I remem∣ber very well, when I was last at an Opera, I could perceive the Eyes of the whole Audience last into particular cross Angles one upon ano∣ther, without any Manner of Regard to the Stage, though King <HI>Latinus</HI> was himself present when I made that Observation. It was then very plea∣sant
<PB N="151" REF="158"/>
to look into the Hearts of the whole Com∣pany; for the Balls of Sight are so form'd, that one Man's Eyes are Spectacles to another to read his Heart with. The most ordinary Beholder can take Notice of any violent Agitation in the Mind, any pleasing Transport, or any inward Grief, in the Person he looks at; but one of these Oglers can see a studied Indifference, a concealed Love, or a smother'd Resentment, in the very Glances that are made to hide those Dispositions of Thought. The Naturalists tell us, That the Rattle Snake will fix himself under a Tree where he sees a Squirrel playing; and when he has once got the Exchange of a Glance from the pretty Wan∣ton, will give it such a sudden Stroke on its Ima∣gination, that though it may play from Bough to Bough, and strive to avert its Eyes from it for some Time, yet it comes nearer and nearer by little In∣tervals of looking another Way, 'till it drops into the Jaws of the Animal, which it knew gazed at it for no other Reason but to ruin it. I did not believe this Piece of Philosophy 'till that Night I was just now speaking of; but I then saw the same Thing pass between an Ogler and a Coquer. <HI>Mirtillo,</HI> the most learned of the former, had for some Time discontinued to visit <HI>Flavia,</HI> no less eminent among the latter. They industriously avoided all Places where they might probably meet, but Chance brought them together to the Playhouse, and seated them in a direct Line over∣against each other, she in a Front Box, he in the Pit next the Stage. As soon as <HI>Flavia</HI> had recei∣ved the Looks of the whole Crowd below her with that Air of Insensibility, which is necessary at the first Entrance, she began to look round her and saw the Vagabond <HI>Mirtillo,</HI> who had so long absented himself from her Circle; and when she first discover'd him, she looked upon him with that Glance, which, in the Language of Oglers, is call'd the <HI>Scornful,</HI> but immediately turn'd her
<PB N="152" REF="159"/>
Observation another Way, and returned upon him with the <HI>Indifferent.</HI> This gave <HI>Mirtillo</HI> no small Resentment; but he used her accordingly. He took Care to be ready for her next Glance. She found his Eyes full in the Indolent, with his Lips crumpled up in the Posture of one Whistling. Her Anger at this Usage immediately appeared in every Muscle of her Face; and after many Emo∣tions, which glisten'd in her Eyes, she cast them round the whole House, and gave 'em Softnesses in the Face of every Man she had ever seen before. After she thought she had reduced all she saw to her Obedience, the Play began and ended their Dialogue. As soon as the first Act was over, she stood up with a Visage full of dissembled Alacrity and Pleasure, with which she overlooked the Au∣dience, and at last came to him; He was then placed in a Side-way, with his Hat slouching over his Eyes, and gazing at a Wench in the Side-Box, as talking of that Gipsy to the Gentle∣man who sate by him. But as she was fixed upon him, he turned suddenly with a full Face upon her, and with all the Respect imaginable, made her the most obsequious Bow in the Presence of the whole Theatre. This gave her a Pleasure not to be concealed, and she made him the Recovering or Second Courtesy, with a Smile that spoke a per∣fect Reconciliation. Between the ensuing Acts, they talked to each other with Gestures and Glan∣ces so significant, that they ridiculed the whole House in this silent Speech, and made an Appoint∣ment that <HI>Mirtillo</HI> should lead her to her Coach.</P>
<P>The peculiar Language of one Eye, as it differs from another, as much as the Tone of one Voice from another, and the Fascination or Enchant∣ment which is lodged in the Optick Nerves of the Persons concerned in these Dialogues, is, I must confess, too nice a Subject for one who is not an Adept in these Speculations; but I shall, for the Good and Safety of the Fair Sex, call my
<PB N="153" REF="160"/>
learned Friend Sir <HI>William Read</HI> to my Assistance, and, by the Help of his Observations on this Or∣gan, acquaint them when the Eye is to be belie∣ved, and when distrusted. On the contrary, I shall conceal the true Meaning of the Looks of Ladies, and indulge in them all the Art they can acquire in the Management of their Glances: All which is but too little against Creatures who tri∣umph in Falshood, and begin to forswear with their Eyes, when their Tongues can be no longer believed.</P>

Wife; and another, in Terms still more moving' of a Purse of Money that was taken from him on <HI>Bagshot</HI> Heath, and which, he tells me, would not have troubled him if he had given it to the Poor. In short, there is scarce a Calamity in humane Life that has not produced me a Letter.</P>
<P>It is indeed wonderful to consider, how Men are able to raise Affliction to themselves out of every Thing. Lands and Houses, Sheep and Oxen, can convey Happiness and Misery into the Hearts of reasonable Creatures. Nay, I have known a Muff, a Scarf, or a Tippet, become a solid Bles∣sing or Misfortune. A Lap-Dog has broke the Hearts of Thousands. <HI>Flavia,</HI> who had buried Five Children, and Two Husbands, was never able to get over the Loss of her Parrat. How of∣ten has a Divine Creature been thrown into a Fit by a Neglect at a Ball or an Assembly? <HI>Mopsa</HI> has kept her Chamber ever since the last Masque∣rade, and is in greater Danger of her Life upon being left out of it, than <HI>Clarinda</HI> from the vio∣lent Cold which she caught at it. Nor are these dear Creatures the only Sufferers by such imagi∣nary Calamities: Many an Author has been de∣jected at the Censure of one whom he ever looked upon as an Idiot; and many a Hero cast into a Fit of Melancholy, because the Rabble have not hooted at him as he passed through the Streets. <HI>Theron</HI> places all his Happiness in a Running Horse, <HI>Suffenus</HI> in a Gilded Chariot, <HI>Fulvius</HI> in a Blue String, and <HI>Florio</HI> in a Tulip Root. It would be endless to enumerate the many fantastical Afflictions that disturb Mankind; but as a Misery is not to be measured from the Nature of the Evil, but from the Temper of the Sufferer, I shall present my Readers, who are unhappy either in Reality or Imagination, with an Allegory, for which I am indebted to the great Father and Prince of Poets.</P>
<P><PB N="156" REF="163"/>
As I was sitting after Dinner in my Elbow-Chair, I took up <HI>Homer,</HI> and dipped into that famous Speech of <HI>Achilles</HI> to <HI>Priam,</HI> in which he tells him, That <HI>Jupiter</HI> has by him Two great Vessels, the one filled with Blessings, and the other with Misfortunes; out of which he mingles a Composition for every Man that comes into the World. This Passage so exceedingly pleased me, that as I fell insensibly into my Afternoon's Slum∣ber, it wrought my Imagination into the follow∣ing Dream.</P>
<P>When <HI>Jupiter</HI> took into his Hands the Govern∣ment of the World, the several Parts of Nature, with the Presiding Deities, did Homage to him. One presented him with a Mountain of Winds, another with a Magazine of Hail, and a third with a Pile of Thunder-bolts. The Stars offer'd up their Influences; the Ocean gave in his Tri∣dent, the Earth her Fruits, and the Sun his Sea∣sons. Among the several Deities who came to make their Court on this Occasion, the Destinies advanced with two great Tuns carried before them, one of which they fixed at the Right Hand of <HI>Jupiter</HI> as he sate upon his Throne, and the other on his Left. The first was filled with all the Blessings, and the other with all the Calami∣ties of Humane Life. <HI>Jupiter,</HI> in the Beginning of his Reign, finding the World much more in∣nocent than it is in this Iron Age, poured very plentifully out of the Tun that stood at his Right Hand; but as Mankind degenerated, and became unworthy of his Blessings, he set abroach the other Vessel, that filled the World with Pain and Poverty, Battles and Distempers, Jealousy and Falshood, intoxicating Pleasures and untimely Deaths.</P>
<P>He was at length so very much incensed at the great Depravation of Humane Nature, and the repeated Provocations which he received from all Parts of the Earth, that having resolved to de∣stroy
<PB N="157" REF="164"/>
the whole Species, except <HI>Deucalion</HI> and <HI>Pyrrha,</HI> he commanded the Destinies to gather up the Blessings which he had thrown away upon the Sons of Men, and lay them up till the World should be inhabited by a more virtuous and deser∣ving Race of Mortals.</P>
<P>The Three Sisters immediately repaired to the Earth, in Search of the several Blessings that had been scatter'd on it; but found the Task which was enjoined them, to be much more difficult than they had imagin'd. The first Places they resorted to, as the most likely to succeed in; were Cities, Palaces, and Courts; but instead of meet∣ing with what they looked for here, they found nothing but Envy, Repining, Uneasiness, and the like bitter Ingredients, of the Left-Hand Vessel. Whereas, to their great Surprize, they discovered Content, Chearfulness, Health, Innocence, and other the most substantial Blessings of Life, in Cottages, Shades, and Solitudes.</P>
<P>There was another Circumstance no less unex∣pected than the former, and which gave them very great Perplexity in the Discharge of the Trust which <HI>Jupiter</HI> had committed to them. They observed, that several Blessings had dege∣nerated into Calamities, and that several Calami∣ties had improved into Blessings, according as they fell into the Possession of wise or foolish Men. They often found Power, with so much Insolence and Impatience cleaving to it, that it became a Misfortune to the Person on whom it was conferred. Youth had often Distempers growing about it, worse than the Infirmities of old Age: Wealth was often united to such a sordid Avarice, as made it the most uncomforta∣ble and painful Kind of Poverty. On the contra∣ry, they often found Pain made glorious by For∣titude, Poverty lost in Content, Deformity beau∣tified with Virtue. In a Word, the Blessings were often like good Fruits planted in a bad Soil, that
<PB N="158" REF="165"/>
by Degrees fall off from their natural Relish, into Tasts altogether insipid or unwholsome; and the Calamities, like harsh Fruits, cultivated in a good Soil, and enriched by proper Grafts and Inocula∣tions, till they swell with generous and delightful Juices.</P>
<P>There was still a Third Circumstance that oc∣casioned as great a Surprize to the Three Sisters as either of the foregoing, when they discovered several Blessings and Calamities which had never been in either of the Tuns that stood by the Throne of <HI>Jupiter,</HI> and were nevertheless as great Occasions of Happiness or Misery as any there. These were that spurious Crop of Blessings and Calamities which were never sown by the Hand of the Deity, but grow of themselves out of the Fancies and Dispositions of Humane Creatures. Such are Dress, Titles, Place, Equipage, false Shame and groundless Fear, with the like vain Imaginations that shoot up in trifling, weak, and irresolute Minds.</P>
<P>The Destinies finding themselves in so great a Perplexity, concluded, that it would be impossible for them to execute the Commands that had been given them according to their first Intention; for which Reason they agreed to throw all the Bles∣sings and Calamities together into one large Ves∣sel, and in that Manner offer them up at the Feet of <HI>Jupiter.</HI></P>
<P>This was performed accordingly, the eldest Si∣ster presenting her self before the Vessel, and in∣troducing it with an Apology for what they had done.</P>
<Q>O <HI>Jupiter!</HI> (says she) we have gathered to∣gether all the Good and Evil, the Comforts and Distresses of Humane Life, which we thus pre∣sent before thee in one promiscuous Heap. We beseech thee that thou thy self wilt sort them out for the future, as in thy Wisdom thou shalt
<PB N="159" REF="166"/>
think fit. For we acknowledge, that there is none beside thee that can judge what will occa∣sion Grief or Joy in the Heart of a Humane Creature, and what will prove a Blessing or a Calamity to the Person on whom it is be∣stowed.</Q>

<P>REading is to the Mind, what Exercise is to the Body. As by the one, Health is preser∣ved, strenthened and invigorated; by the other, Virtue (which is the Health of the Mind) is kept alive, cherished and confirmed. But as Exercise becomes tedious and painful when we make use of it only as the Means of Health, so Reading is apt to grow uneasy and burdensome, when we apply our selves to it only for our Improvement in Vir∣tue. For this Reason, the Virtue which we ga∣ther from a Fable, or an Allegory, is like the Health we get by Hunting; as we are engaged in an agreeable Pursuit that draws us on with Pleasure, and makes us insensible of the Fatigues that ac∣company it.</P>
<P>After this Preface, I shall set down a very beautiful Allegorical Fable out of the great Poet whom I mentioned in my last Paper, and whom it is very difficult to lay aside when one is enga∣ged in the reading of him. And this I particularly design for the Use of several of my Fair Correspon∣dents, who in their Letters have complained to
<PB N="160" REF="167"/>
me, that they have lost the Affections of their Husbands, and desire my Advice how to recover them.</P>
<P><HI>Juno,</HI> says <HI>Homer,</HI> seeing her <HI>Jupiter</HI> seated on the Top of Mount <HI>Ida,</HI> and knowing that he had conceived an Aversion to her, began to study how she should regain his Affections, and make her self amiable to him. With this Thought she immedi∣ately retired into her Chamber, where she bathed her self in <HI>Ambrosia,</HI> which gave her Person all its Beauty, and diffused so divine an Odor, as re∣fresh'd all Nature, and sweeten'd both Heaven and Earth. She let her immortal Tresses flow in the most graceful Manner, and took a particular Care to dress her self in several Ornaments, which the Poet describes at length, and which the Goddess chose out as the most proper to set off her Person to the best Advantage. In the next Place, she made a Visit to <HI>Venus,</HI> the Deity who presides over Love, and begged of her, as a par∣ticular Favour, that she would lend her for a while those Charms with which she subdued the Hearts both of Gods and Men. For, says the Goddess, I would make use of them to reconcile the Two Deities, who took Care of me in my Infancy, and who, at present, are at so great a Variance, that they are estranged from each other's Bed. <HI>Venus</HI> was proud of an Opportunity of obliging so great a Goddess, and therefore made her a Present of the <HI>Cestus</HI> which she used to wear about her own Wast, with Advice to hide it in her Bosom till she had accomplished her In∣tention. This <HI>Cestus</HI> was a fine Party-coloured Girdie, which, as <HI>Homer</HI> tells us, had all the At∣tractions of the Sex wrought into it. The Four principal Figures in the Embroidery were Love, Desi e, Fondness of Speech, and Conversation, filled with that Sweetness and Complacency, which, says the Poet, insensibly steal away the Hearts of the wisest Men.</P>
<P><PB N="161" REF="168"/>
<HI>Juno,</HI> after having made these necessary Prepa∣rations, came as by Accident into the Presence of <HI>Jupiter,</HI> who is said to have been as much infla∣med with her Beauty, as when he first stole to her Embraces without the Consent of their Parents. <HI>Juno,</HI> to cover her real Thoughts, told him as she had told <HI>Venus,</HI> That she was going to make a Visit to <HI>Oceanus</HI> and <HI>Tethys.</HI> He prevailed upon her to stay with him, protesting to her, that she appeared more amiable in his Eye, than ever any Mortal, Goddess, or even her self, had appeared to him till that Day. The Poet then represents him in so great an Ardour, that (without going up to the House which had been built by the Hands of <HI>Vulcan</HI> according to <HI>Juno</HI>'s Direction) he threw a Golden Cloud over their Heads as they sate upon the Top of Mount <HI>Ida,</HI> while the Earth beneath them sprung up in Lotus's, Saf∣frons, Hyacinths, and a Bed of the softest Flowers for their Repose.</P>
<P>This close Translation of one of the finest Pas∣sages in <HI>Homer,</HI> may suggest abundance of Instru∣ction to a Woman who has a Mind to preserve or recal the Affection of her Husband. The Care of the Person, and the Dress, with the particular Blandishments woven in the <HI>Cestus,</HI> are so plainly recommended by this Fable, and so indispensibly necessary in every Female who desires to please, that they need no further Explanation. The Dis∣cretion likewise in covering all Matrimonial Quar∣rels from the Knowledge of others, is taught in the pretended Visit to <HI>Tethys,</HI> in the Speech where <HI>Juno</HI> addresses her self to <HI>Venus;</HI> as the chast and prudent Management of a Wife's Charms is inti∣mated by the same Pretence for her appearing be∣fore <HI>Jupiter,</HI> and by the Concealment of the <HI>Cestus</HI> in her Bosom.</P>
<P>I shall leave this Tale to the Consideration of such good Housewives who are never well dres∣sed but when they are Abroad, and think it ne∣cessary
<PB N="162" REF="169"/>
to appear more agreeable to all Men living than their Husbands: As also to those prudent Ladies, who to avoid the Appearance of being over-fond, entertain their Husbands with Indiffe∣rence, Aversion, sullen Silence, or exasperating Language.</P>

<P>Upon my coming Home last Night, I found a very handsome Present of Wine left for me, as a Tast <HI>of</HI> 216 <HI>Hogsheads which are to be put to Sale at</HI> 20 l. <HI>a Hogshead, at</HI> Garraway's <HI>Coffee-house in</HI> Ex∣change-Alley, <HI>on the</HI> 22<HI>d Instant, at</HI> 3 <HI>in the After∣noon, and to be tasted in Major</HI> Long<HI>'s Vaults from the</HI> 20<HI>th Instant till the Time of Sale.</HI> This having been sent to me with a Desire that I would give my Judgment upon it, I immediately impannel∣led a Jury of Men of nice Palates and strong Heads, who being all of them very scrupulous, and unwilling to proceed rashly in a Matter of so great Importance, refus'd to bring in their Ver∣dict till Three in the Morning; at which Time the Foreman pronounc'd, as well as he was able, Extra—a—ordinary <HI>French</HI> Claret. For my own Part, as I love to consult my Pillow in all Points of Moment, I slept upon it before I would give my Sentence, and this Morning confirmed the Verdict.</P>
<P>Having mentioned this Tribute of Wine, I must give Notice to my Correspondents for the future, who shall apply to me on this Occasion, That as I shall decide nothing unadvisedly in Matters of this Nature, I cannot pretend to give Judgment of a right good Liquor, without examining at least Three Dozen Bottles of it. I must at the same Time do my self the Justice to let the World know, that I have resisted great Temptations in this Kind; as it is well known to a Butcher in <HI>Clare-Market,</HI> who endeavoured to corrupt me with a Dozen and half of Marrow-Bones. I had
<PB N="163" REF="170"/>
likewise a Bribe sent me by a Fishmonger, con∣sisting of a Collar of Brawn, and a Joll of Sal∣mon; but not finding them excellent in their Kinds, I had the Integrity to eat them both up, without speaking one Word of them. However, for the future, I shall have an Eye to the Diet of this great City, and will recommend the best and most wholesome Food to them, if I receive these proper and respectful Notices from the Sel∣lers, that it may not be said hereafter, my Rea∣ders were better taught than fed.</P>

<P>HAVING intimated in my last Paper, that I design to take under my Inspection the Diet of this great City, I shall begin with a ve∣ry earnest and serious Exhortation to all my well∣disposed Readers, that they would return to the Food of their Forefathers, and reconcile them∣selves to Beef and Mutton. This was the Diet which bred that hardy Race of Mortals who won the Fields of <HI>Cressy</HI> and <HI>Agincourt.</HI> I need not go up so high as the History of <HI>Guy</HI> Earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI> who is well known to have eaten up a Dun Cow of his own killing. The Renown'd King <HI>Arthur</HI> is generally looked upon as the first who ever sat down to a whole roasted Ox, (which was certainly the best Way to preserve the Gravy) and it is further added, that he and his Knights sat about it at his Round Table, and usually
<PB N="164" REF="171"/>
consumed it to the very Bones before they would enter upon any Debate of Moment. The Black Prince was a professed Lover of the Bris∣ket; not to mention the History of the Surloin, or the Institution of the Order of Beef-Eaters, which are all so many evident and undeniable Marks of the great Respect which our Warlike Predecessors have paid to this excellent Food. The Tables of the ancient Gentry of this Nation were cover'd thrice a Day with hot Roast-Beef; and I am credibly informed, by an Antiquary who has searched the Registers, in which the Bills of Fare of the Court are recorded, that in∣stead of Tea and Bread and Butter, which have prevailed of late Years, the Maids of Honour in Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s Time were allowed Three Rumps of Beef for their Breakfast. Mutton has likewise been in great Repute among our valiant Countrymen, but was formerly observed to be the Food rather of Men of nice and delicate Ap∣petites, than those of strong and robust Constitu∣tions. For which Reason, even to this Day, we use the Word Sheep-Biter as a Term of Reproach, as we do Beef-Eater in a respectful and honoura∣ble Sense. As for the Flesh of Lamb, Veal, Chicken, and other Animals under Age, they were the Invention of sickly and degenerate Pa∣lates, according to that wholesome Remark of <HI>Daniel</HI> the Historian, who takes Notice, That in all Taxes upon Provisions, during the Reigns of several of our Kings, there is nothing mentioned besides the Flesh of such Fowl and Cattle as were arrived at their full Growth, and were ma∣ture for Slaughter. The Common People of this Kingdom do still keep up the Taste of their Ancestors; and it is to this that we in a great Measure owe the unparallelled Victories that have been gained in this Reign: For I would desire my Reader to consider, what Work our Country∣men would have made at <HI>Blenheim</HI> and <HI>Ramil∣lies,</HI>
<PB N="165" REF="172"/>
if they had been fed with Fricacies and Ra∣gousts.</P>
<P>For this Reason, we at present see the florid Complexion, the strong Limb, and the hale Constitution, are to be found chiefly among the meaner Sort of People, or in the wild Gentry, who have been educated among the Woods or Mountains. Whereas many great Families are insensibly fallen off from the Athletick Consti∣tution of their Progenitors, and are dwindled away into a pale, sickly, spindle-legged Gene∣ration of Valetudinarians.</P>
<P>I may perhaps be thought extravagant in my Notion; but I must confess, I am apt to impute the Dishonours that sometimes happen in great families to the inflaming kind of Diet which is so much in Fashion. Many Dishes can excite Desire without giving Strength, and heat the Body without nourishing it; as Physicians ob∣serve, That the poorest and most dispirited Blood is most subject to Fevers. I look upon a <HI>French</HI> Ragoust to be as pernicious to the Stomach as a Glass of Spirits; and when I have seen a young Lady swallow all the Instigations of high Soups, seasoned Sauces, and forced Meats, I have won∣dered at the Despair or tedious Sighing of her Lovers.</P>
<P>The Rules among these false Delicates, are to be as Contradictory as they can be to Nature.</P>
<P>Without expecting the Return of Hunger, they eat for an Appetite, and prepare Dishes not to al∣lay, but to excite it.</P>
<P>They admit of nothing at their Tables in its natural Form, or without some Disguise.</P>
<P>They are to eat every Thing before it comes in Season, and to leave it off as soon as it is good to be eaten.</P>
<P>They are not to approve any Thing that is agreeable to ordinary Palates; and nothing is to
<PB N="166" REF="173"/>
gratify their Senses, but what would offend those of their Inferiors.</P>
<P>I remember I was last Summer invited to a Friend's House, who is a great Admirer of the <HI>French</HI> Cookery, and (as the Phrase is) <HI>eats well.</HI> At our fitting down, I found the Table covered with a great Variety of Unknown Dishes. I was mightily at a Loss to learn what they were, and therefore did not know where to help my self. That which stood before me, I took to be a roasted Porcupine, however did not care for ask∣ing Questions; and have since been informed, that it was only a larded Turkey. I afterwards passed my Eye over several Hashes, which I do not know the Names of to this Day; and hearing that they were Delicacies, did not think fit to meddle with them.</P>
<P>Among other Dainties, I saw something like a Pheasant, and therefore desired to be helped to a Wing of it; but to my great Surprize, my Friend told me it was a Rabbet, which is a sort of Meat I never cared for. At last I discovered, with some Joy, a Pig at the lower End of the Table, and begged a Gentleman that was near it to cut me a Piece of it. Upon which the Gentleman of the House said, with great Civility, I am sure you will like the Pig, for it was whipped to Death. I must confess, I heard him with Horror, and could not eat of an Animal that had died so tra∣gical a Death. I was now in great Hunger and Confusion, when, methought, I smelled the a∣greeable Savour of Roast Beef, but could not tell from which Dish it arose, though I did not que∣stion but it lay disguised in one of them. Upon turning my Head, I saw a noble Sirloin on the Side-Table smoaking in the most delicious Man∣ner. I had Recourse to it more than once, and could not see, without some Indignation, that substantial <HI>English</HI> Dish banished in so igno∣minious
<PB N="167" REF="174"/>

<P>The Desert was brought up at last, which in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>th was as extraordinary as any Thing that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> come before it.

<P>IT has often been a solid Grief to me, when I have reflected on this glorious Nation, which is the Scene of publick Happiness and Liberty, that there are still Crowds of private Tyrants, against whom there neither is any Law now in Being, nor can there be invented any by the Wit of Man. These cruel Men are ill-natured Husbands. The Commerce in the Conjugal State is so delicate, that it is impossible to prescribe Rules for the Conduct of it, so as to fit Ten Thousand name∣less Pleasures and Disquietudes which arise to People in that Condition. But it is in this as in some other nice Cases, where touching upon the Malady tenderly, is half Way to the Cure; and there are some Faults which need only to be observed to be amended. I am put into this Way of thinking by a late Conversation which I am going to give an Account of.</P>
<P>I made a Visit the other Day to a Family for which I have a great Honour, and found the Fa∣ther, the Mother, and Two or Three of the younger Children, drop off designedly to leave me alone with the eldest Daughter, who was but a Visitant there as well as my self, and is the Wife of a Gentleman of a very fair Character in the World. As soon as we were alone, I saw her Eyes fall of Tears, and methought she had much to say to me, for which she wanted En∣couragement. Madam, said I, you know I wish you all as well as any Friend you have: Speak freely what I see you are oppressed with, and
<PB N="169" REF="176"/>
you may be sure, if I cannot relieve your Di∣stress, you may at least reap so much present Ad∣vantage, as safely to give your self the Ease of uttering it. She immediately assumed the most becoming Composure of Countenance, and spoke as follows: <Q REND="inline">'It is an Aggravation of Affliction in a married Life, that there is a Sort of Guilt in communicating it: For which Rea∣son it is, that a Lady of your and my Ac∣quaintance, instead of speaking to you her self, desired me the next Time I saw you, as you are a professed Friend to our Sex, to turn your Thoughts upon the reciprocal Complaisance which is the Duty of a married State.' <P>'My Friend was neither in Fortune, Birth or Education, below the Gentleman whom she has married. Her Person, her Age, and her Character, are also such as he can make no Ex∣ception to. But so it is, that from the Moment the Marriage-Ceremony was over, the Obse∣quiousness of a Lover was turned into the Haughtiness of a Master. All the kind En∣deavours which she uses to please him, are at best but so many Instances of her Duty. This Insolence takes away that secret Satisfaction, which does not only excite to Virtue, but also rewards it. It abates the Fire of a free and generous Love, and imbitters all the Pleasures of a social Life. The young Lady spoke all this with such an Air of Resentment, as discovered how nearly she was concerned in the Distress.'</P></Q></P>
<P>When I observed she had done speaking, Ma∣dam, said I, the Affliction you mention is the greatest that can happen in Humane Life, and I know but one Consolation in it, if that be a Con∣solation, that the Calamity is a pretty general one. There is nothing so common as for Men to enter into Marriage, without so much as expect∣ing to be happy in it. They seem to propose to

themselves a few Holidays in the Beginning of it; after which they are to return at best to the usual Course of their Life; and for ought they know, to constant Misery and Uneasiness. From this false Sense of the State they are going into, proceeds the immediate Coldness and Indiffe∣rence, or Hatred and Aversion, which attend ordinary Marriages, or rather Bargains to coha∣bit. Our Conversation was here interrupted by Company which came in upon us.</P>
<P>The Humour of affecting a superior Carriage, generally rises from a false Notion of the Weak∣ness of a Female Understanding in general, or an over-weaning Opinion that we have of our own: For when it proceeds from a natural Rug∣gedness and Brutality of Temper, it is altoge∣ther incorrigible, and not to be amended by Ad∣monition. Sir <HI>Francis Bacon,</HI> as I remember, lays it down as a Maxim, That no Marriage can be happy in which the Wife has no Opinion of her Husband's Wisdom; but without Offence to so great an Authority, I may venture to say, That a sullen-wife Man is as bad as a good-na∣tured Fool. Knowledge, softened with Compla∣cency and good Breeding, will make a Man equal∣ly beloved and respected; but when joined with a severe, distant and unsociable Temper, it creates rather Fear than Love. I who am a Batchelor, have no other Notion of Conjugal Tenderness, out what I learn from Books, and shall there∣fore produce Three Letters of <HI>Pliny,</HI> who was not only one of the greatest, but the most <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>arned Men in the whole <HI>Roman</HI> Empire. At the same Time I am very much ashamed, that on such Occasions I am obliged to have Re∣cou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se to Heathen Authors, and shall appeal to my Readers, if they would not think it a Mark of a narrow Education in a Man of Qua∣lity to write such passionate Letters to any Wo∣man but a Mistress.

<P>I Never was so much offended at Business, as when it hindered me from going with you into the Country, or following you thither: For I more particularly wish to be with you at present, that I might be sensible of the Pro∣gress you make in the Recovery of your Strength and Health; as also of the Enter∣tainment and Diversions you can meet with in your Retirement. Believe me, it is an anxious State of Mind to live in Ignorance of what happens to those whom we passionately love. I am not only in Pain for your Absence, but al∣so for your Indisposition. I am afraid of every Thing, fancy every Thing, and, as it is the Na∣ture of Men in Fear, I fancy those Things most which I am most afraid of. Let me there∣fore earnestly desire you to favour me under these my Apprehensions with One Letter every Day, or, if possible, with Two; for I shall be a little at Ease while I am reading your Letters, and grow anxious again as soon as I have read them.</P>

<P>YOU tell me, That you are very much af∣flicted at my Absence, and that you have no Satisfaction in any Thing but my Writings, which you often lay by you upon my Pillow.

In Return, I must let you know, I am no less pleased with the Letters which you writ to me, and read them over a Thousand

<P>IT is impossible to conceive how much I lan∣guish for you in your Absence; the tender Love I bear you, is the chief Cause of this my Uneasiness, which is still the more insupporta∣ble, because Absence is wholly a new Thing to us. I lie awake most Part of the Night in thinking of you, and several Times of the Day go as naturally to your Apartment, as if you were there to receive me; but when I miss you, I come away dejected, out of Humour, and like a Man that had suffered a Repulse. There is but one Part of the Day in which I am relieved from this Anxiety, and that is when I am engaged in Publick Affairs.</P>
<P>You may guess at the uneasy Condition of one who has no Rest but in Business, no Conso∣lation but in Trouble.</P>

<P>I shall conclude this Paper with a beautiful Passage out of <HI>Milton,</HI> and leave it as a Lecture to those of my own Sex, who have a Mind to make their Conversation agreeable as well as instru∣ctive, to the Fair Partners who are fallen into their Care. <HI>Eve</HI> having observed, That <HI>Adam</HI> was entring into some deep Disquisitions with the Angel, who was sent to visit him, is de∣scribed as retiring from their Company, with a Design of learning what should pass there from her Husband.</P>

<P>I Have received the following Letter upon the Subject of my last Paper. The Writer of it tells me, I there spoke of Marriage as one that knows it only by Speculation, and for that Rea∣son he sends me his Sense of it, as drawn from Experience.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Mr. <HI>Bickerstaff,</HI></SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Have read your Paper of this Day, and think you have done the Nuptial State a great deal of Justice in the Authority you give us of <HI>Pliny,</HI> whose Letters to his Wife you have there tran∣slated: But give me Leave to tell you, That it is impossible for you, that are a Batchelor, to have so just a Notion of this Way of Life, as
<PB N="174" REF="181"/>
to touch the Affections of your Readers in a Particular, wherein every Man's own Heart suggests more than the nicest Observer can form to himself without Experience. I therefore, who am an old married Man, have sat down to give you an Account of the Matter from my own Knowledge, and the Observations which I have made upon the Conduct of others in that most agreeable or wretched Condition.</P>
<P>It is very commonly observed, That the most smart Pangs whech we meet with are in the Beginning of Wedlock, which proceed from Ignorance of each others Humour, and Want of Prudence to make Allowances for a Change from the most careful Respect, to the most un∣bounded Familiarity. Hence it arises, That Trifles are commonly Occasions of the greatest Anxiety; for Contradiction being a Thing wholly unusual between a new married Couple, the smallest Instance of it is taken for the highest Injury; and it very seldom happens, that the Man is slow enough in assuming the Character of an Husband, or the Woman quick enough in condescending to that of a Wife. It imme∣diately follows, That they think they have all the Time of their Courtship been talking in Masks to each other, and therefore begin to act like disappointed People. <HI>Philander</HI> finds <HI>Delia</HI> ill-natur'd and impertinent; and <HI>Delia, Philander</HI> surly and inconstant.</P>
<P>I have known a fond Couple quarrel in the very Honey-moon about cutting up a Tart: Nay, I could name Two, who after having had Seven Children, fell out and parted Beds upon the boiling of a Leg of Mutton. My very next Neighbours have not spoke to one another these Three Days, because they differ'd in their Opi∣nions, whether the Clock should stand by the Window, or over the Chimney. It may seem strange to you, who are not a married Man,
<PB N="175" REF="182"/>
when I tell you, how the least Trifle can strike a Woman dumb for a Week together. But if you ever enter into this State, you will find, that the Soft Sex as often express their Anger by an obstinate Silence, as by an ungovernable Cla∣mour.</P>
<P>Those indeed who begin this Course of Life without Jars at their setting out, arrive with∣in few Months at a Pitch of Benevolence and Affection, of which the most perfect Friend∣ship is but a feint Resemblance. As in the un∣fortunate Marriage, the most minute and in∣different Things are Objects of the sharpest Re∣sentment; so in an happy One, they are Occa∣sions of the most exquisite Satisfaction. For what does not oblige in one we love? What does not offend in one we dislike? For these Reasons I take it for a Rule, That in Marriage, the chief Business is to acquire a Prepossession in Favour of each other. They should consi¦der one another's Words and Actions with a secret Indulgence: There should be always an inward Fondness pleading for each other, such as may add new Beauties to every Thing that is excellent, give Charms to what is indiffe∣rent, and cover every Thing that is defective. For want of this kind Propensity and Biass of Mind, the married Pair often take Thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>as ill of each other, which no one else would take Notice of in either of them.</P>
<P>But the most unhappy Circumstance of all is, where each Party is always laying up Fuel for Dissention, and gathering together a Maga∣zine of Provocations to exasperate each other with when they are out of Humour. These People in common Discourse make no Scruple to let those who are by know they are quarrelling with one another, and think they are discreet enough, if they conceal from the Company the Matters which they are hinting at.

a Week ago, I was entertained for a whole Dinner with a mysterious Conversation of this Nature; out of which I could learn no more, than that the Husband and Wife were angry at one another. We had no sooner sate down, but says the Gentleman of the House, in order to raise Discourse, I thought <HI>Margarita</HI> sung extremely well last Night. Upon this, says the Lady, looking as pale as Ashes, I suppose she had Cherry-coloured Ribands on. No, an∣swered the Husband, with a Flush in his Face, but she had Laced Shoes. I look upon it, that a Stander-by on such Occasions has as much Reason to be out of Countenance as ei∣ther of the Combatants. To turn off my Con∣fusion, and seem regardless of what had passed, I desired the Servant who attended to give me the Vinegar, which unluckily created a new Dialogue of Hints; for as far as I could gather by the subsequent Discourse, they had dissented the Day before about the Preference of Elder to Wine-Vinegar. In the Midst of their Dis∣course, there appeared a Dish of Chickens and Sparagrass, when the Husband seemed dis∣posed to lay aside all Disputes; and looking upon her with a great deal of good Nature, said, Pray, my Dear, will you help my Friend to a Wing of the Fowl that lies next you, for I think it looks extremely well. The Lady, instead of answering him, addressing her self to me, Pray, Sir, said she, do you in <HI>Surrey</HI> reckon the white or the black-legged Fowls the best? I found the Husband changed Co∣lour at the Question; and before I could an∣swer, asked me, Whether we did not call Hops Broom in our Country? I quickly found, they did not ask Questions so much out of Curiosity as Anger: For which Reason I thought fit to keep my Opinion to my self, and, as an ho∣nest Man ought, (when he sees Two Friends in
<PB N="177" REF="184"/>
Warmth with each other) I took the first Op∣portunity I could to leave them by themselves.</P>
<P>You see, Sir, I have laid before you only small Incidents, which are seemingly frivial; but take it from a Man who am very well ex∣perienced in this State, they are principally Evils of this Nature which make Marriages un∣happy. At the same Time, that I may do Justice to this excellent Institution, I must own to you, there are unspeakable Pleasures which are as little regarded in the Computation of the Advantages of Marriage, as the others are in the usual Survey that is made of its Mis∣fortunes.</P>
<P><HI>Lovemore</HI> and his Wife live together in the happy Possession of each other's Hearts, and by that Means have no indifferent Moments, but their whole Life is one continued Scene of Delight. Their Passion for each other commu∣nicates a certain Satisfaction, like that which they themselves are in, to all that approach them. When she enters the Place where he is, you see a Pleasure which he cannot conceal, nor he or any one else describe. In so consum∣mate an Affection, the very Presence of the Person beloved, has the Effect of the most a¦greeable Conversation. Whether they have Matter to talk of or not, they enjoy the Plea∣sures of Society, and at the same Time the Free∣dom of Solitude. Their ordinary Life is to be preferred to the happiest Moments of other Lovers. In a Word, they have each of them great Merit, live in the Esteem of all who know them, and seem but to comply with the Opinions of their Friends, in the just Value they have for each other.</P>

<P>WHEN Artists would expose their Dia∣monds to an Advantage, they usually set them to Show in little Cases of black Velvet. By this Means the Jewels appear in their true and genuine Lustre, while there is no Colour that can infect their Brightness, or give a false Cast to the Water. When I was at the Opera the other Night, the Assembly of Ladies in Mourn∣ing made me consider them in the same Kind of View. A Dress wherein there is so little Variety, shows the Face in all its natural Charms, and makes one differ from another only as it is more or less beautiful. Painters are ever careful of of∣fending against a Rule which is so essential in all just Representation. The chief Figure must have the strongest Point of Light, and not be injured by any gay Colourings that may draw away the Attention to any less considerable Part of the Picture. The present Fashion obliges every Body to be dress'd with Propriety, and makes the Ladies Faces the principal Objects of Sight. Every beau∣tiful Person shines out in all the Excellence with which Nature has adorned her: Gawdy Ribands and glaring Colours being now out of Use, the Sex has no Opportunity given them to disfi∣gure themselves, which they seldom fail to do whenever it lies in their Power. When a Woman comes to her Glass, she does not em∣ploy
<PB N="179" REF="186"/>
her Time in making her self look more ad∣vantagiously what she really is, but endeavours to be as much another Creature as she possibly can. Whether this happens, because they stay so long, and attend their Work so diligently, that they forget the Faces and Persons which they first sate down with, or whatever it is, they sel∣dom rise from the Toilet the same Women they appeared when they began to dress. What Jewel can the Charming <HI>Cleora</HI> place in her Ears, that can please her Beholders so much as her Eyes? The Cluster of Diamonds upon the Breast can add no Beauty to the fair Chest of Ivory which supports it. It may indeed tempt a Man to steal a Woman, but never to love her. Let <HI>Thalestris</HI> change her self into a Motly Party-coloured Animal: The Pearl Neck-lace, the Flowered Stomacher, the Artificial Nosegay, and Shaded Furbelow, may be of Use to attract the Eye of the Beholder, and turn it from the Im∣perfections of her Features and Shape. But if Ladies will take my Word for it, (and as they dress to please Men, they ought to consult our Fancy rather than their own in this Particular) I can ass re them, there is nothing touches our Imagination so much as a beautiful Woman in a plain Dress. There might be more agreeable Ornaments found in our own Manufacture, than any that rise out of the Looms of <HI>Persia.</HI></P>
<P>This, I know, is a very harsh Doctrine to Wo∣man-kind, who are carried away with every Thing that is showy, and with what delights the Eye, more than any other Species of Living Creatures whatsoever. Were the Minds of the Sex laid open, we should find the chief Idea in one to be a Tippet, in another a Muff, in a Third a Fan, and in a Fourth a Fardingal. The Me∣mory of an old Visiting-Lady is so filled with Gloves, Silks, and Ribands, that I can look upon it as nothing else but a Toy-shop. A Matron of
<PB N="180" REF="187"/>
my Acqaintance complaining of her Daughter's Vanity, was observing, that she had all of a sud∣den held up her Head higher than ordinary, and taken an Air that showed a secret Satisfaction in her self, mixed with a Scorn of others. I did not know, says my Friend, what to make of the Carriage of this Fantastical Girl, till I was in∣formed by her elder Sister, that she had a Pair of striped Garters on. This odd Turn of Mind often makes the Sex unhappy, and disposes them to be struck with every Thing that makes a Show, however trifling and superficial.</P>
<P>Many a Lady has fetched a Sigh at the Toss of a Wig, and been ruined by the Tapping of a Snuff box. It is impossible to describe all the Execution that was done by the Shoulder-Knot while that Fashion prevailed, or to reckon up all the Virgins that have fallen a Sacrifice to a Pair of fringed Gloves. A sincere Heart has not made half so many Conquests as an open Wast∣coat; and I should be glad to see an able Head make so good a Figure in a Woman's Company as a Pair of Red Heels. A <HI>Grecian</HI> Hero, when he was asked whether he could play upon the Lute, thought he had made a very good Reply when he answered, No, but I can make a great City of a little One. Notwithstanding his boasted Wisdom, I appeal to the Heart of any Toast in Town, whether she would not think the Luta∣nist preferable to the Statesman. I do not speak this out of any Aversion that I have to the Sex: On the contrary, I have always had a Tender∣ness for them; but I must confess, it troubles me very much, to see the Generality of them place their Affections on improper Objects, and give up all the Pleasures of Life for Gugaws and Trifles.</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Margery Bickerstaff,</HI> my great Aunt, had a Thousand Pounds to her Portion, which our Fa∣mily was desirous of keeping among themselves,
<PB N="181" REF="188"/>
and therefore used all possible Means to turn off her Thoughts from Marriage. The Method they took, was, in any Time of Danger to throw a new Gown or Petticoat in her Way. When she was about Twenty five Years of Age, she fell in Love with a Man of an agreeable Temper, and equal Fortune, and would certainly have married him, had not my Grandfather, Sir <HI>Jacob,</HI> dressed her up in a Suit of flowered Sattin; upon which, she set so immoderate a Value upon her self, that the Lover was contemned and discarded. In the Fortieth Year of her Age, she was again smitten, but very luckily transferred her Pas∣sion to a Tippet, which was presented to her by another Relation who was in the Plot. This, with a white Sarsenet Hood, kept her safe in the Family till Fifty. About Sixty, which gene∣rally produces a Kind of latter Spring in amo∣rous Constitutions, my Aunt <HI>Margery</HI> had again a Colt's-Tooth in her Head, and would certainly have eloped from the Mansion-house, had not her Brother <HI>Simon,</HI> who was a wise Man, and a Scho∣lar, advised to dress her in Cherry-coloured Ri∣bands, which was the only Expedient that could have been found out by the Wit of Man to pre∣serve the Thousand Pounds in our Family, Part of which I enjoy at this Time.</P>
<P>This Discourse puts me in Mind of an Hu∣morist mentioned by <HI>Horace,</HI> called <HI>Eutrapelus,</HI> who, when he designed to do a Man a Mischief, made him a Present of a gay Suit; and brings to my Memory another Passage of the same Author, when he describes the most ornamental Dress that a Woman can appear in with Two Words, <HI>Simplex Munditiis,</HI> which I have quoted for the Benefit of my Female Readers.</P>

<P>A Man who confines his Speculations to the Time present, has but a very narrow Pro∣vince to employ his Thoughts in. For this Rea∣son, Persons of studious and contemplative Na∣tures often entertain themselves with the History of past Ages, or raise Schemes and Conjectures upon Futurity. For my own Part, I love to range through that Half of Eternity which is still to come, rather than look on that which is already run out; because I know I have a real Share and Interest in the one, whereas all that was trans∣acted in the other, can be only Matter of Cu∣riosity to me.</P>
<P>Upon this Account, I have been always very much delighted with meditating on the Soul's Immortality, and in reading the several Notions which the wisest of Men, both ancient and mo∣dern, have entertained on that Subject. What the Opinions of the greatest Philosophers have been, I have several times hinted at, and shall give an Account of them from Time to Time as Occasion requires. It may likewise be worth while to consider, what Men of the most exalted Genius, and elevated Imagination, have thought of this Matter. Among these, <HI>Homer</HI> stands up as a Prodigy of Mankind, that looks down upon the rest of Humane Creatures as a Species beneath him. Since he is the most ancient Hea∣then
<PB N="183" REF="190"/>
Author, we may guess from his Relation, what were the common Opinions in his Time concerning the State of the Soul after Death.</P>
<P><HI>Ulysses,</HI> he tells us, made a Voyage to the Re∣gions of the Dead, in order to consult <HI>Tiresias</HI> how he should return to his own Country, and recommend himself to the Favour of the Gods. The Poet scarce introduces a single Person, who doth not suggest some useful Precept to his Rea∣der, and designs his Description of the Dead for the Amendment of the Living.</P>
<P><HI>Ulysses,</HI> after having made a very plenteous Sa∣crifice, sate him down by the Pool of Holy Blood, which attracted a prodigious Assembly of Ghosts of all Ages and Conditions, that hovered about the Hero, and feasted upon the Steams of his Oblation. The first he knew, was the Shade of <HI>Elpenor,</HI> who, to show the Activity of a Spirit a∣bove that of Body, is represented as arrived there long before <HI>Ulysses,</HI> notwithstanding the Winds and Seas had contributed all their Force to hasten his Voyage thither. This <HI>Elpenor,</HI> to inspire the Reader with a Detestation of Drunkenness, and at the same Time with a religious Care of doing proper Honours to the Dead, describes himself as having broken his Neck in a Debauch of Wine; and begs <HI>Ulysses,</HI> that for the Repose of his Soul, he would build a Monument over him, and per∣form Funeral Rites to his Memory. <HI>Ulysses</HI> with great Sorrow of Heart promises to fulfil his Re∣quest, and is immediately diverted to an Object much more moving than the former. The Ghost of his own Mother <HI>Anticlea,</HI> whom he still thought living, appears to him among the Multi∣tude of Shades that surrounded him, and sits down at a small Distance from him by the Lake of Blood, without speaking to him, or knowing who he was. <HI>Ulysses</HI> was exceedingly troubled at the Sight, and could not forbear weeping as he look'd upon her: But being all along set forth as
<PB N="184" REF="191"/>
a Pattern of consummate Wisdom, he makes his Affection give Way to Prudence; and therefore, upon his seeing <HI>Tiresias,</HI> does not reveal himself to his Mother, till he had consulted that great Prophet, who was the Occasion of this his De∣scent into the Empire of the Dead. <HI>Tiresias</HI> ha∣ving cautioned him to keep himself and his Com∣panions free from the Guilt of Sacrilege, and to pay his Devotions to all the Gods, promises him a safe Return to his Kingdom and Family, and a happy old Age in the Enjoyment of them.</P>
<P>The Poet having thus with great Art kept the Curiosity of the Reader in Suspence, represents his wise Man, after the Dispatch of his Business with <HI>Tiresias,</HI> as yielding himself up to the Calls of natural Affection, and making himself known to his Mother. Her Eyes are no sooner opened, but she cries out in Tears, <HI>Oh my Son!</HI> and en∣quires into the Occasions that brought him thi∣ther, and the Fortune that attended him.</P>
<P><HI>Ulysses</HI> on the other Hand desires to know, what the Sickness was that had sent her into those Regions, and the Condition in which she had left his Father, his Son, and more particu∣larly his Wife. She tells him, they were all Three inconsolable for his Absence; <HI>and as for my self,</HI> says she, <HI>That was the Sickness of which I died. My Impatience for your Return, my Anxiety for your Welfare, and my Fondness for my Dear</HI> Ulysses, <HI>were the only Distempers that prey'd upon my Life, and separated my Soul from my Body. Ulysses</HI> was melted with these Expressions of Ten∣derness, and Thrice endeavoured to catch the Apparition in his Arms, that he might hold his Mother to his Bosom and weep over her.</P>
<P>This gives the Poet Occasion to describe the Notion the Heathens at that Time had of an un∣bodied Soul, in the Excuse which the Mother makes for seeming to withdraw her self from her Son's Embraces. <HI>The Soul,</HI> says she, <HI>is composed</HI>
<PB N="185" REF="192"/>
<HI>neither of Bones, Flesh, nor Sinews, but leaves be∣hind her all those Incumbrances of Mortality to be consumed on the Funeral Pile. As soon as she has thus cast her Burthen, she makes her Escape, and flies away from it like a Dream.</HI></P>
<P>When this melancholy Conversation is at an End, the Poet draws up to View as charming a Vision as could enter into Man's Imagination. He describes the next who appeared to <HI>Ulysses,</HI> to have been the Shades of the finest Women that had ever lived upon the Earth, and who had ei∣ther been the Daughters of Kings, the Mistresses of Gods, or Mothers of Heroes, such as <HI>Antiope, Alemena, Leda, Ariadne, Iphimedia, Eri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hyle,</HI> and several others, of whom he gives a Catalogue, with a short History of their Adventures. The beautiful Assembly of Apparitions were all ga∣thered together about the Blood: Each of them, says <HI>Ulysses,</HI> (as a gentle Satyr upon Female Va∣nity) <HI>giving me an Account of her Birth and Fa∣mily.</HI> This Scene of extraordinary Women, seems to have been designed by the Poet as a Lecture of Mortality to the whole Sex, and to put them in Mind of what they must expect, notwithstand∣ing the greatest Perfections, and highest Honours, they can arrive at.</P>
<P>The Circle of Beauties at length disappeared, and was succeeded by the Shades of several <HI>Gre∣cian</HI> Heroes who had been engaged with <HI>Ulysses</HI> in the Siege of <HI>Troy.</HI> The first that approached was <HI>Agamemnon,</HI> the Generalissimo of that great Expedition, who at the Appearance of his old Friend wept very bitterly, and without saying any Thing to him, endeavoured to grasp him by the Hand. <HI>Ulysses,</HI> who was much moved at the Sight, pour'd out a Flood of Tears, and ask'd him the Occasion of his Death, which <HI>Agamem∣non</HI> related to him in all its Tragical Circumstan∣ces; how he was murthered at a Banquet by the Contrivance of his own Wife, in Confederacy
<PB N="186" REF="193"/>
with her Adulterer: From whence he takes Oc¦casion to reproach the whole Sex, after a Man¦ner which would be inexcusable in a Man who had not been so great a Sufferer by them. <HI>My Wife</HI> (says he) <HI>has disgraced all the Women that shall ever be born into the World, even those who hereafter shall be innocent: Take Care how you grow too fond of your Wife. Never tell her all you know. If you reveal some Things to her, be sure you keep others concealed from her. You indeed have nothing to fear from your</HI> Penelope, <HI>she will not use you as my Wife has treated me; however, take Care how you trust a Woman.</HI> The Poet, in this and other Instances, according to the System of many Hea∣then as well as Christian Philosophers, shows, how Anger, Revenge, and other Habits which the Soul had contracted in the Body, subsist and grow in it under its State of Separation.</P>
<P>I am extremely pleased with the Companions which the Poet in the next Description assigns to <HI>Achilles. Achilles</HI> (says the Hero) <HI>came up to me with</HI> Patroclus <HI>and</HI> Antilochus. By which we may see that it was <HI>Homer</HI>'s Opinion, and proba∣bly that of the Age he lived in, that the Friend∣ships which are made among the Living, will likewise continue among the Dead. <HI>Achilles</HI> en∣quires after the Welfare of his Son, and of his Father, with a Fierceness of the same Character that <HI>Homer</HI> has every where expressed in the Actions of his Life. The Passage relating to his Son is so extremely beautiful, that I must not omit it. <HI>Ulysses,</HI> after having described him as wise in Council, and active in War, and mentioned the Foes whom he had slain in Battle, adds an Observation that he himself had made of his Be∣haviour whilst he lay in the Wooden Horse. <HI>Most of the Generals</HI> (says he) <HI>that were with us, either wept or trembled: As for your Son, I neither saw him wipe a Tear from his Cheeks, or change his Countenance. On the contrary, he would often lay</HI>
<PB N="187" REF="194"/>
<HI>his Hand upon his Sword, or grasp his Spear, as impatient to employ them against the</HI> Trojans. He then informs his Father of the great Honour and Rewards which he had purchased before <HI>Troy,</HI> and of his Return from it without a Wound. The Shade of <HI>Achilles,</HI> says the Poet, was so pleased with the Account he received of his Son, that he enquired no further, but stalked away with more than ordinary Majesty over the green Meadow that lay before them.</P>
<P>This last Circumstance of a deceased Father's rejoicing in the Behaviour of his Son, is very finely contrived by <HI>Homer,</HI> as an Incentive to Virtue, and made use of by none that I know besides himself.</P>
<P>The Description of <HI>Ajax,</HI> which follows, and his refusing to speak to <HI>Ulysses,</HI> who had won the Armour of <HI>Achilles</HI> from him, and by that Means occasioned his Death, is admired by every one that reads it. When <HI>Ulysses</HI> relates the Sullen∣ness of his Deportment, and considers the Great∣ness of the Hero, he expresses himself with ge∣nerous and noble Sentiments. <HI>Oh! that I had never gained a Prize which cost the Life of so brave a Man as</HI> Ajax! <HI>Who, for the Beauty of his Person, and Greatness of his Actions, was inferior to none but the Divine</HI> Achilles. The same noble Con∣descension, which never dwells but in truly great Minds, and such as <HI>Homer</HI> would represent that of <HI>Ulysses</HI> to have been, discovers it self likewise in the Speech which he made to the Ghost of <HI>Ajax</HI> on that Occasion. <HI>Oh</HI> Ajax! says he, <HI>Will you keep your Resentments even after Death? What Destructions hath this fatal Armour brought upon the</HI> Greeks, <HI>by robbing them of you, who were their Bulwark and Defence?</HI> Achilles <HI>is not more bitter∣ly lamented among us than you. Impute not then your Death to any one but</HI> Jupiter, <HI>who out of his Anger to the</HI> Greeks, <HI>took you away from among them: Let me entreat you to approach me; restrain</HI>
<PB N="188" REF="195"/>
<HI>the Fierceness of your Wrath, and the Greatness of your Soul, and bear what I have to say to you. Ajax,</HI> without making a Reply, turned his Back upon him, and retired into a Crowd of Ghosts.</P>
<P><HI>Ulysses,</HI> after all these Visions, took a View of those impious Wretches who lay in Tortures for the Crimes they had committed upon the Earth, whom he describes under all the Varieties of Pain, as so many Marks of Divine Vengeance, to deter others from following their Example. He then tells us, That notwithstanding he had a great Curiosity to see the Hero's that lived in the Ages before him, the Ghosts began to ga∣ther about him in such prodigious Multitudes, and with such a Confusion of Voices, that his Heart trembled as he saw himself amidst so great a Scene of Horrors. He adds, That he was afraid lest some hideous Spectre should ap∣pear to him, that might terrify him to Distraction; and therefore withdrew in Time.</P>
<P>I question not but my Reader will be pleased with this Description of a future State, repre∣sented by such a noble and fruitful Imagination, that had nothing to direct it besides the Light of Nature, and the Opinions of a dark and ig∣norant Age.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>From my own Apartment, <DATE>March 31.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Have heard of a very valuable Picture, where∣in all the Painters of the Age in which it was drawn, are represented sitting together in a Cir∣cle,
<PB N="189" REF="196"/>
and joining in a Consort of Musick. Each of them plays upon such a particular Instrument as is the most suitable to his Character, and ex∣presses that Style and Manner of Painting which is peculiar to him. The famous Cupola-Painter of those Times, to show the Grandeur and Bold∣ness of his Figures, hath a Horn in his Mouth, which he seems to wind with great Strength and Force. On the contrary, an eminent Artist, who wrought up his Pictures with the greatest Accu∣racy, and gave them all those delicate Touches which are apt to please the nicest Eye, is repre∣sented as tuning a Theorbo. The same Kind of Humour runs through the whole Piece.</P>
<P>I have often from this Hint imagined to my self, that different Talents in Discourse might be shadowed out after the same Manner by different Kinds of Musick; and that the several conversa∣ble Parts of Mankind in this great City, might be cast into proper Characters and Divisions, as they resemble several Instruments that are in Use among the Masters of Harmony. Of these therefore in their Order, and First of the Drum.</P>
<P>Your Drums are the Blusterers in Conversation, that with a loud Laugh, unnatural Mirth, and a Torrent of Noise, domineer in publick Assem∣blies, over-bear Men of Sense, stun their Com∣panions, and fill the Place they are in with a rat∣ling Sound, that hath seldom any Wit, Humour, or good Breeding in it. The Drum notwith∣standing, by this boisterous Vivacity, is very proper to impose upon the Ignorant; and in Conversation with Ladies, who are not of the finest Tast, often passes for a Man of Mirth and Wit, and for wonderful pleasant Company. I need not observe, that the Emptiness of the Drum very much contributes to its Noise.</P>
<P>The Lute is a Character directly opposite to the Drum, that sounds very finely by it self, or
<PB N="190" REF="197"/>
in a very small Consort. Its Notes are exquisite∣ly sweet, and very low, easily drowned in a Multitude of Instruments, and even lost among a few, unless you give a particular Attention to it. A Lute is seldom heard in a Company of more then Five, whereas a Drum will show it self to Advantage in an Assembly of Five hun∣dred. The Lutanists therefore are Men of a fine Genius, uncommon Reflection, great Affability, and esteemed chiefly by Persons of a good Tast, who are the only proper Judges of so delightful and soft a Melody.</P>
<P>The Trumpet is an Instrument that has in it no Compass of Musick, or Variety of Sound, but is notwithstanding very agreeable, so long as it keeps within its Pitch. It has not above Four or Five Notes, which are however very pleasing, and capable of exquisite Turns and Modulations. The Gentlemen who fall under this Denomina∣tion, are your Men of the most fashionable Edu∣cation and refined Breeding, who have learned a certain Smoothness of Discourse, and Sprightli∣ness of Air, from the polite Company they have kept; but at the same Time have shallow Parts, weak Judgments, and a short Reach of Under∣standing: A Playhouse, a Drawing-Room, a Ball, a Visiting-Day, or a Ring at <HI>Hide-Park,</HI> are the few Notes they are Masters of, which they touch upon in all Conversations. The Trumpet how∣ever is a necessary Instrument about a Court, and a proper Enlivener of a Consort, tho' of no great Harmony by it self.</P>
<P>Violins are the lively, forward, importunate Wits, that distinguish themselves by the Flou∣rishes of Imagination, Sharpness of Repartee, Glances of Satyr, and bear away the upper Part in every Consort. I cannot however but observe, That when a Man is not dispos'd to hear Musick, there is not a more disagreeable Sound in Har∣mony than that of a Violin.</P>
<P><PB N="191" REF="198"/>
There is another Musical Instrument, which is more frequent in this Nation than any other; I mean your Bass-Viol, which grumbles in the Bottom of the Consort, and with a surly Mascu∣line Sound strengthens the Harmony, and tem∣pers the Sweetness of the several Instruments that play along with it. The Bass-Viol is an In∣strument of a quiet different Nature to the Trum∣pet, and may signifie Men of rough Sense, and un∣polish'd Parts, who do not love to hear themselves talk, but sometimes break out with an agreeable Bluntless, unexpected Wit, and su<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly Pleasantries, to the no small Diversion of their Friends and Companions. In short, I look upon every sen∣sible true-born <HI>Britain</HI> to be naturally a Bass-Viol.</P>
<P>As for your Rural Wits, who talk with great Eloquence and Alacrity of Foxes, Hounds, Hor∣ses, Quickset Hedges, and Six-Bar Gates, double Ditches, and broken Necks, I am in Doubt, whether I should give them a Place in the con∣versable World. However, if they will content themselves with being raised to the Dignity of Hunting-Horns, I shall desire for the future that they may be known by that Name.</P>
<P>I must not here omit the Bagpipe Species, that will entertain you from Morning to Night with the Repetition of a few Notes, which are play'd over and over, with the perpetual Humming of a Drone running underneath them. These are your dull, heavy, tedious Story Tellers, the Load and Burthen of Conversations, that set up for Men of Importance, by knowing secret History, and giving an Account of Transactions, that whether they ever passed in the World or not, doth not signify an Halfpenny to its Instruction, or its Wel∣fare. Some have observed, That the <HI>Northern</HI> Parts of this Island are more particularly fruitful in Bagpipes.</P>
<P><PB N="192" REF="199"/>
There are so very few Persons who are Masters in every Kind of Conversation, and can talk on all Subjects, that I don't know whether we should make a distinct Species of them: Never∣theless, that my Scheme may not be defective, for the Sake of those few who are endowed with such extraordinary Talents, I shall allow them to be Harpsicords, a Kind of Musick which every one knows is a Consort by it self.</P>
<P>As for your Passing-Bells, who look upon Mirth as Criminal, and talk of nothing but what is melancholy in it self, and mortifying to Hu∣mane Nature, I shall not mention them.</P>
<P>I shall likewise pass over in Silence all the Rabble of Mankind, that crowd our Streets, Cof∣fee-houses, Feasts, and publick Tables. I can∣not call their Discourse Conversation, but rather something that is practised in Imitation of it. For which Reason, if I would describe them by any Musical Instrument, it should be by those modern Inventions of the Bladder and String, Tongs and Key, Marrow-Bone and Cleaver.</P>
<P>My Reader will doubtless observe, That I have only touched here upon Male Instruments, ha∣ving reserved my Female Consort to another Oc∣casion. If he has a Mind to know where these several Characters are to be met with, I could direct him to a whole Club of Drums; not to mention another of Bagpipes, which I have be∣fore given some Account of in my Description of our Nightly Meetings in <HI>Sheer-Lane.</HI> The Lutes may often be met with in Couples upon the Banks of a Chrystal Stream, or in the Retreats of shady Woods and flowry Meadows; which for different Reasons are likewise the great Re∣sort of your Hunting-Horns. Bass-Viols are fre∣quently to be found over a Glass of stale Beer and a Pipe of Tobacco; whereas those who set up for Violins, seldom fail to make their Appea∣rance at <HI>Will</HI>'s once every Evening. You may
<PB N="193" REF="200"/>
meet with a Trumpet any where on the other Side of <HI>Charing-Cross.</HI></P>
<P>That we may draw something for our Advan∣tage in Life out of the foregoing Discourse, I must entreat my Reader to make a narrow Search into his Life and Conversation, and upon his lea∣ving any Company, to examine himself seri∣ously, whether he has behaved himself in it like a Drum or a Trumpet, a Violin or a Bass-Viol; and accordingly endeavour to mend his Musick for the future. For my own Part, I must confess, I was a Drum for many Years; nay, and a very noisy one, till having polished my self a little in good Company, I threw as much of the Trum∣pet into my Conversation as was possible for a Man of an impetuous Temper, by which Mixture of different Musicks, I look upon my self, during the Course of many Years, to have resembled a Tabor and Pipe. I have since very much endea∣voured at the Sweetness of the Lute; but in Spight of all my Resolutions, I must confess with great Confusion, that I find my self daily degenerating into a Bagpipe; whether it be the Effect of my old Age, or of the Company I keep, I know not. All that I can do, is to keep a Watch over my Conversation, and to silence the Drone as soon as I find it begin to hum in my Discourse, being determined ra∣ther to hear the Notes of others, than to play out of Time, and incroach upon their Parts in the Consort by the Noise of so tiresome an In∣strument.</P>
<P>I shall conclude this Paper with a Letter which I received last Night from a Friend of mine, who knows very well my Notions upon this Subject, and invites me to pass the Even∣ing at his House, with a select Company of Friends, in the following Words:</P>

<P>WE have already examined <HI>Homer</HI>'s De∣scription of a Future State, and the Con∣dition in which he hath placed the Souls of the Deceased. I shall in this Paper make some Ob∣servations on the Account which <HI>Virgil</HI> hath gi∣ven us of the same Subject, who, besides a Great∣ness of Genius, had all the Lights of Philosophy and Humane Learning to assist and guide him in his Discoveries.</P>
<P><HI>Aeneas</HI> is represented as descending into the Empire of Death, with a Prophetess by his Side, who instructs him in the Secrets of those lower Regions.</P>
<P>Upon the Confines of the Dead, and before the very Gates of this infernal World, <HI>Virgil</HI> describes several Inhabitants, whose Natures are wonder∣fully suited to the Situation of the Place, as be∣ing either the Occasions or Resemblances of
<PB N="195" REF="202"/>
Death. Of the first Kind are the Shadows of Sickness, Old Age, Fear, Famine, and Poverty; (Apparitions very terrible to behold) with seve∣ral others, as Toil, War, Contention, and Dis∣cord, which contribute all of them to people this common Receptacle of humane Souls. As this was likewise a very proper Residence for every Thing that resembles Death, the Poet tells us, That Sleep, whom he represents as a near Relation to Death, has likewise his Habitation in these Quarters, and describes in them a huge gloomy Elm-Tree, which seems a very proper Ornament for the Place, and is possessed by an innumerable Swarm of Dreams, that hang in Clusters under every Leaf of it. He then gives us a List of imaginary Persons, who very natu∣rally lie within the Shadow of the Dream-Tree, as being of the same Kind of Make in them∣selves, and the Materials or (to use <HI>Shakespeare</HI>'s Phrase) the Stuff of which Dreams are made. Such are the Shades of the Giant with a Hun∣dred Hands, and of his Brother with Three Bo∣dies; of the double-shap'd <HI>Centaur,</HI> and <HI>Sylla;</HI> the <HI>Gorgon</HI> with Snakey Hair; the <HI>Harpy</HI> with a Woman's Face and Lion's Talons; the Seven∣headed <HI>Hydra;</HI> and the <HI>Chimaera,</HI> which breaths forth a Flame, and is a Compound of Three Animals. These several mix'd Natures, the Creatures of Imagination, are not only introdu∣ced with great Art after the Dreams, but as they are planted at the very Entrance, and with∣in the very Gates of those Regions, do probably denote the wild Deliriums and Extravagancies of Fancy, which the Soul usually falls into when she is just upon the Verge of Death.</P>
<P>Thus far <HI>Aeneas</HI> travels in an Allegory. The rest of the Description is drawn with great Ex∣actness, according to the Religion of the Hea∣thens, and the Opinions of the <HI>Platonick</HI> Philo∣sophy. I shall not trouble my Reader with a com∣mon
<PB N="196" REF="203"/>
dull Story, that gives an Account why the Heathens first of all supposed a Ferryman in Hell, and his Name to be <HI>Charon;</HI> but must not pass over in Silence the Point of Doctrine which <HI>Vir∣gil</HI> hath very much insisted upon in this Book, That the Souls of those who are unburied, are not permitted to go over into their respective Places of Rest, till they have wandered a Hun∣dred Years upon the Banks of <HI>Styx.</HI> This was probably an Invention of the Heathen Priest∣hood, to make the People extremely careful of performing proper Rights and Ceremonies to the Memory of the Dead. I shall not however, with the infamous Scribblers of the Age, take an Oc∣casion from such a Circumstance, to run into Declamations against Priestcraft, but rather look upon it even in this Light as a Religious Artifice, to raise in the Minds of Men an Esteem for the Memory of their Forefathers, and a Desire to recommend themselves to that of Posterity; as also to excite in them an Ambition of imitating the Virtues of the Deceased, and to keep alive in their Thoughts the Sense of the Soul's Immor∣tality. In a Word, we may say in Defence of the severe Opinions relating to the Shades of unburied Persons, what hath been said by some of our Divines in regard to the rigid Doctrines concerning the Souls of such who die without being initiated into our Religion, That supposing they should be erroneous, they can do no Hurt to the Dead, and will have a good Effect upon the Living, in making them cautious of neg∣lecting such necessary Solemnities.</P>
<P><HI>Charon</HI> is no sooner appeas'd, and the Triple∣headed Dog laid asleep, but <HI>Aeneas</HI> makes his Entrance into the Dominions of <HI>Pluto.</HI> There are Three Kinds of Persons described, as being situated on the Borders; and I can give no Rea∣son for their being stationed there in so particular a Manner, but because they none of them seem
<PB N="197" REF="204"/>
to have had a proper Right to a Place among the Dead, as not having run out the whole Thread of their Days, and finished the Term of Life that had been allotted them upon Earth. The First of these are the Souls of Infants, who are snatched away by untimely Ends: The Second, are of those who are put to Death wrongfully, and by an unjust Sentence; and the Third, of those who grew weary of their Lives, and laid violent Hands upon themselves. As for the Second of these, <HI>Virgil</HI> adds with great Beauty, That <HI>Mi∣nos,</HI> the Judge of the Dead, is employed in giving them a Rehearing, and assigning them their several Quarters suitable to the Parts they acted in Life. The Poet, after having mentioned the Souls of those unhappy Men who destroyed themselves, breaks out into a fine Exclamation; <HI>Oh! how gladly,</HI> says he, <HI>would they now endure Life with all its Miseries! But the Destinies forbid their Return to Earth, and the Waters of</HI> Styx <HI>sur∣round them with Nine Streams that are unpassable.</HI> It is very remarkable, that <HI>Virgil,</HI> notwithstand∣ing Self-murther was so frequent among the Heathens, and had been practised by some of the greatest Men in the very Age before him, hath here represented it as so heinous a Crime. But in this Particular he was guided by the Doctrines of his great Master <HI>Plato,</HI> who says on this Sub∣ject, That a Man is placed in his Station of Life like a Soldier in his proper Post, which he is not to quit whatever may happen, until he is called off by his Commander who planted him in it.</P>
<P>There is another Point in the Platonick Philo∣sophy, which <HI>Virgil</HI> has made the Ground-work of the greatest Part in the Piece we are now exa∣mining, having with wonderful Art and Beauty materializ'd (if I may so call it) a Scheme of ab∣stracted Notions, and cloathed the most nice re∣fined Conceptions of Philosophy in Sensible Ima∣ges,
<PB N="198" REF="205"/>
and Poetical Representations. The Plato∣nists tell us, That the Soul, during her Resi∣dence in the Body, contracts many virtuous and vicious Habits, so as to become a beneficient, mild, charitable, or an angry, malicious, re∣vengeful Being: A Substance inflam'd with Lust, Avarice, and Pride; or, on the contrary, bright∣en'd with pure, generous, and humble Disposi∣tions: That these and the like Habits of Virtue and Vice growing into the very Essence of the Soul, survive and gather Strength in her after her Dissolution: That the Torments of a vicious Soul in a future State arise principally from those importunate Passions which are not capable of being gratified without a Body; and that on the contrary, the Happiness of virtuous Minds very much consists in their being employed in sublime Speculatins, innocent Diversions, sociable Af∣fections, and all the Extasies of Passion and Rap∣ture which are agreeable to reasonable Na∣tures, and of which they gained a Relish in this Life.</P>
<P>Upon this Foundation, the Poet raises that beautiful Description of the secret Haunts and Walks, which he tells us are inhabited by de∣ceased Lovers.</P>
<P>Not far from hence, says he, lies a great Wast of Plains, that are called the Fields of Melan∣choly. In these there grows a Forrest of Myrtle, divided into many shady Retirements and cover∣ed Walks, and inhabited by the Souls of those who pined away with Love. The Passion, says he, continues with them after Death. He then gives a List of this languishing Tribe, in which his own <HI>Dido</HI> makes the principal Figure, and is describ'd as living in this soft Romantick Scene, with the Shade of her first Husband <HI>Sy∣chaeus.</HI></P>
<P>The Poet in the next Place mentions another Plain that was peopled with the Ghosts of War∣riors
<PB N="199" REF="206"/>
as still delighting in each other's Com∣pany, and pleased with the Exercise of Arms. He there represents the <HI>Graecian</HI> Generals and common Soldiers who perished in the Siege of <HI>Troy</HI> as drawn up in Squadrons, and terrified at the Approach of <HI>Aeneas,</HI> which renewed in them those Impressions of Fear they had before re∣ceived in Battle with the <HI>Trojans.</HI> He afterwards likewise, upon the same Notion, gives a View of the <HI>Trojan</HI> Heroes who lived in former Ages, amidst a visionary Scene of Chariots and Arms, flowry Meadows, shining Spears, and generous Steeds, which he tells us were their Pleasures upon Earth, and now make up their Happiness in <HI>Elysium.</HI> For the same Reason also, he men∣tions others as singing Paeans, and Songs of Tri∣umph, amidst a beautiful Grove of Laurel. The Chief of the Consort was the Poet <HI>Musaeus,</HI> who stood inclosed with a Circle of Admirers, and rose by the Head and Shoulders above the Throng of Shades that surrounded him. The Habita∣tions of unhappy Spirits, to shew the Duration of their Torments, and the desperate Condition they are in, are represented as guarded by a Fury, moated round with a Lake of Fire, streng∣thened with Towers of Iron, encompassed with a triple Wall, and fortified with Pillars of Ada∣mant, which all the Gods together are not able to heave from their Foundations. The Noise of Stripes, the Clank of Chains, and the Groans of the Tortured, strike the poius <HI>Aeneas</HI> with a kind of Horror. The Poet afterwards divides the Criminals into two Classes: The first and blackest Catalogue consists of such as were guil∣ty of Outrages against the Gods; and the next, of such who were convicted of Injustice between Man and Man: The greatest Number of whom, says the Poet, are those who followed the Dictates of Avarice.</P>
<P><PB N="200" REF="207"/>
It was an Opinion of the Platonists, That the Souls of Men having contracted in the Body great Stains and Pollutions of Vice and Ignorance, there were several Purgations and Cleansings ne∣cessary to be passed through both here and here∣after, in order to refine and purify them.</P>
<P><HI>Virgil,</HI> to give this Thought likewise a Cloath∣ing of Poetry, describes some Spirits as bleaching in the Winds, others as cleansing under great Falls of Waters, and others as purging in Fire to recover the primitive Beauty and Purity of their Natures.</P>
<P>It was likewise an Opinion of the same Sect of Philosophers, That the Souls of all Men exist in a separate State, long before their Union with their Bodies; and that upon their Immersion in∣to Flesh, they forget every Thing which passed in the State of Pre-existence; so that what we here call Knowledge, is nothing else but Memory, or the Recovery of those Things which we knew before.</P>
<P>In pursuance of this Scheme, <HI>Virgil</HI> gives us a View of several Souls, who, to prepare them∣selves for living upon Earth, flock about the Banks of the River <HI>Lethe,</HI> and swill themselves with the Waters of Oblivion.</P>
<P>The same Scheme gives him an Opportunity of making a noble Compliment to his Countrymen, where <HI>Anchises</HI> is represented taking a Survey of the long Train of Heroes that are to descend from him, and giving his Son <HI>Aeneas</HI> an Account of all the Glories of his Race.</P>
<P>I need not mention the Revolution of the Pla∣tonick Year, which is but just touched upon in this Book; and as I have consulted no Authors Thoughts in this Explication, shall be very well pleased, if it can make the noblest Piece of the most accomplished Poet more agreeable to my female Readers, when they think sit to look in∣to <HI>Dryden</HI>'s Translation of it.</P>

<P>THere lived some Years since within my Neighbourhood a very grave Person, an Upholsterer, who seemed a Man of more than ordinary Application to Business. He was a very early Riser, and was often abroad Two or Three Hours before any of his Neighbours. He had a particular Carefulness in the knitting of his Brows, and a kind of Impatience in all his Motions, that plainly discovered he was always intent on Matters of Importance. Upon my Enquiry in∣to his Life and Conversation, I found him to be the greatest Newsmonger in our Quarter; that he rose before Day to read the <HI>Post-Man;</HI> and that he would take Two or Three Turns to the other End of the Town before his Neighbours were up, to see if there were any <HI>Dutch</HI> Mails come in. He had a Wife and several Children; but was much more inquisitive to know what passed in <HI>Poland</HI> than in his own Family, and was in greater Pain and Anxiety of Mind for King <HI>Augustus</HI>'s Welfare than that of his nearest Rela∣tions. He looked extremely thin in a Dearth of News, and never enjoyed himself in a Westerly Wind. This indefatigable kind of Life was the Ruin of his Shop; for about the Time that his Favourite Prince left the Crown of <HI>Poland,</HI> he broke and disappeared.</P>
<P><PB N="202" REF="209"/>
This Man and his Affairs had been long out of my Mind, till about Three Days ago, as I was walking in St. <HI>James</HI>'s Park, I heard some body at a Distance hemming after me: And who should it be but my old Neighbour the Upholsterer? I saw he was reduced to extreme Poverty, by certain shabby Superfluities in his Dress: For notwithstand∣ing that it was a very sultry Day for the Time of the Year, he wore a loose great Coat and a Muff, with a long Campaign-Wig out of Curl; to which he had added the Ornament of a Pair of black Garters buckled under the Knee. Upon his coming up to me, I was going to enquire into his present Circumstances; but was pre∣vented by his asking me, with a Whisper, Whe∣ther the last Letters brought any Accounts that one might rely upon from <HI>Bender?</HI> I told him, None that I heard of; and asked him, Whether he had yet married his eldest Daughter? He told me, No. But pray, says he, tell me sincerely, What are your Thoughts of the King of <HI>Sweden?</HI> For tho' his Wife and Children were starving, I found his chief Concern at present was for this great Monarch. I told him, That I looked upon him as one of the first Heroes of the Age. But pray, says he, do you think there is any Thing in the Story of his Wound? And finding me sur∣prised at the Question, Nay, says he, I only pro∣pose it to you. I answered, That I thought there was no Reason to doubt of it. But why in the Heel. says he, more than in any other Part of the Body? Because, says I, the Bullet chanced to light there.</P>
<P>This extraordinary Dialogue was no s one ended, but he began to launch out into a long Dissertation upon the Affairs of the <HI>North;</HI> and after having spent some Time on them, he told me, He was in a great Perplexity how to recon∣cile the <HI>Supplement</HI> with the <HI>English-Post,</HI> and had been just now examining what the other Papers
<PB N="203" REF="210"/>
say upon the same Subject. The <HI>Daily Courant,</HI> says he, has these Words, <HI>We have Advices from very good Hands, That a certain Prince has some Matters of great Importance under Consideration.</HI> This is very mysterious; but the <HI>Post-Boy</HI> leaves us more in the Dark, for he tells us, <HI>That there are private Intimations of Measures taken by a certain Prince, which Time will bring to Light.</HI> Now the <HI>Post-Man,</HI> says he, who uses to be very clear, refers to the same News in these Words; <HI>The late Conduct of a certain Prince affords great Matter of Speculation.</HI> This certain Prince, says the Upholsterer, whom they are all so cautious of naming, I take to be—Upon which, tho' there was no Body near us, he whispered something in my Ear, which I did not hear, or think worth my while to make him repeat.</P>
<P>We were now got to the upper End of the <HI>Mall,</HI> where were Three or Four very odd Fel∣lows sitting together upon the Bench. These I found were all of them Politicians, who used to Sun themselves in that Place every Day about Dinner-Time. Observing them to be Curiosities in their Kind, and my Friend's Acquaintance, I sat down among them.</P>
<P>The chief Politician of the Bench was a great Asserter of Paradoxes. He told us, with a seem∣ing Concern, That by some News he had lately read from <HI>Muscovy,</HI> it appeared to him that there was a Storm gathering in the Black Sea, which might in Time do Hurt to the Naval Forces of this Nation. To this he added, That for his Part, he could not wish to see the Turk driven out of <HI>Europe,</HI> which he believed could not but be prejudicial to our Woollen Manufacture. He then told us, That he looked upon those extraor∣dinary Revolutions which had lately happened in these Parts of the World, to have risen chiefly from Two Persons who were not much talked of; and those, says he, are Prince <HI>Menzikoff,</HI> and
<PB N="204" REF="211"/>
the Dutchess of <HI>Mirandola.</HI> He back'd his As∣sertions with so many broken Hints, and such a Show of Depth and Wisdom, that we gave our selves up to his Opinions.</P>
<P>The Discourse at length fell upon a Point which seldom escapes a Knot of true-born <HI>English∣men,</HI> Whether in Case of a Religious War, the Protestants would not be too strong for the Pa∣pists? This we unanimously determined on the Protestant Side. One who sat on my Right Hand, and, as I found by his Discourse, had been in the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> assured us, That it would be a very easie Matter for the Protestants to beat the Pope at Sea; and added, That whenever such a War does break out, it must turn to the Good of the <HI>Leeward</HI> Islands. Upon this, one who sat at the End of the Bench, and, as I afterwards found, was the Geographer of the Company, said, That in case the Papists should drive the Protestants from these Parts of <HI>Europe,</HI> when the worst came to the worst, it would be impossible to beat them out of <HI>Norway</HI> and <HI>Greenland,</HI> provided the Nor∣thern Crowns hold together, and the Czar of <HI>Muscavy</HI> stand Neuter.</P>
<P>He further told us for our Comfort, That there were vast Tracts of Land about the Pole, in∣habited neither by Protestants nor Papists, and of greater Extent than all the <HI>Roman</HI> Catholick Do∣minions in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>When we had fully discussed this Point, my Friend the Upholsterer began to exert himself upon the present Negotiations of Peace, in which he deposed Princes, settled the Bounds of King∣doms, and ballanced the Power of <HI>Europe,</HI> with great Justice and Impartiality.</P>
<P>I at length took my Leave of the Company, and was going away; but had not been gone Thirty Yards, before the Upholsterer hemm'd again after me. Upon his advancing towards me, with a Whisper, I expected to hear some secret
<PB N="205" REF="212"/>
Piece of News, which he had not thought fit to communicate to the Bench; but instead of that, he desired me in my Ear to lend him Half a Crown. In Compassion to so needy a Statesman, and to dissipate the Confusion I found he was in, I told him, if he pleased, I would give him Five Shillings, to receive Five Pounds of him when the Great Turk was driven out of <HI>Const intinople;</HI> which he very readily accepted, but not before he had laid down to me the Impossibility of such an Event, as the Affairs of <HI>Europe</HI> now stand.</P>
<P>This Paper I design for the particular Benefit of those worthy Citizens who live more in a Coffee-house than in their Shops, and whose Thoughts are so taken up with the Affairs of the Allies, that they forget their Customers.</P>

<P>WE have already described out of <HI>Homer</HI> the Voyage of <HI>Ulysses</HI> to the Infernal Shades, with the several Adventures that attended it. If we look into the beautiful Romance published not many Years since by the Archbishop of <HI>Cam∣bray,</HI> we may see the Son of <HI>Ulysses</HI> bound on the same Expedition, and after the same Manner making his Discoveries among the Regions of the Dead. The Story of <HI>Telemachus</HI> is formed altogether in the Spirit of <HI>Homer,</HI> and will give an unlearned Reader a Notion of that great Poet's Manner of Writing, more than any Translation of him can possibly do. As it was written for
<PB N="206" REF="213"/>
the Instruction of a young Prince, who may one Day sit upon the Throne of <HI>France,</HI> the Author took Care to suit the several Parts of his Story, and particularly the Description we are now en∣tring upon, to the Character and Quality of his Pupil. For which Reason, he insists very much on the Misery of bad, and the Happiness of good Kings, in the Account he hath given of Punish∣ments and Rewards in the other World.</P>
<P>We may however observe, notwithstanding the Endeavours of this great and learned Author, to copy after the Style and Sentiments of <HI>Homer,</HI> that there is a certain Tincture of Christianity running through the whole Relation. The Prelate in several Places mixes himself with the Poet; so that his future State puts me in Mind of <HI>Michael Angelo</HI>'s Last Judgment, where <HI>Charon</HI> and his Boat are represented as bearing a Part in the dreadful Solemnities of that great Day.</P>
<P><HI>Telemachus,</HI> after having passed through the dark Avenues of Death in the Retinue of <HI>Mer∣cury,</HI> who every Day delivers up a certain Tale of Ghosts to the Ferryman of <HI>Styx,</HI> is admitted into the Infernal Bark. Among the Companions of his Voyage, is the Shade of <HI>Nabopharzon,</HI> a King of <HI>Babylon,</HI> and Tyrant of all the <HI>East.</HI> Among the Ceremonies and Pomps of his Funeral, there were Four Slaves sacrificed, according to the Cu∣stom of the Country, in order to attend him a∣mong the Shades. The Author having described this Tyrant in the most odious Colours of Pride, Insolence, and Cruelty, tells us, That his Four Slaves, instead of serving him after Death, were perpetually insulting him with Reproaches and Affronts for his past Usage; That they spurn'd him as he lay upon the Ground, and forc'd him to show his Face, which he would fain have co∣vered, as lying under all the Confusions of Guilt and Infamy; and in short, that they kept him
<PB N="207" REF="214"/>
bound in a Chain, in order to drag him before the Tribunal of the Dead.</P>
<P><HI>Telemachus,</HI> upon looking out of the Bark, sees all the Strand covered with an innumerable Mul∣titude of Shades, who, upon his jumping ashore, immediately vanished. He then pursues his Course to the Palace of <HI>Pluto,</HI> who is described as seated on his Throne in terrible Majesty, with <HI>Proserpine</HI> by his Side. At the Foot of his Throne was the pale hideous Spectre, who, by the Ghastliness of his Visage, and the Nature of the Apparitions that surrounded him, discovers him∣self to be Death. His Attendants are, Melan∣choly, Distrust, Revenge, Hatred, Avarice, De∣spair, Ambition, Envy, Impiety, with frightful Dreams, and waking Cares, which are all drawn very naturally in proper Actions and Postures. The Author, with great Beauty, places near his frightful Dreams an Assembly of Phantoms, which are often employed to terrify the Living, by appearing in the Shape and Likeness of the Dead.</P>
<P>The young Hero in the next Place takes a Survey of the different Kinds of Criminals that lay in Torture among Clouds of Sulphur, and Torrents of Fire. The First of these were such as had been guilty of Impieties, which every one hath an Horror for: To which is added, a Catalogue of such Offenders that scarce appear to be faulty in the Eyes of the Vulgar. Among these, says the Author, are malicious Criticks, that have endeavoured to cast a Blemish upon the Perfections of others; with whom he likewise places such as have often hurt the Reputation of the Innocent, by passing a rash Judgment on their Actions, without knowing the Occasion of them. These Crimes, says he, are more se∣verely punished after Death, because they gene∣rally meet with Impunity upon Earth.</P>
<P><PB N="208" REF="215"/>
<HI>Telemachus,</HI> after having taken a Survey of se∣veral other Wretches in the same Circumstances, arrives at that Region of Torments in which wicked Kings are punished. The e are very fine Strokes of Imagination in the Description which he gives of this unhappy Multitude. He tells us, That on one Side of them there stood a re∣vengesul Fury, thundering in their Ears incessant Repetitions of all the Crimes they had commit∣ted upon Earth, with the Aggravations of Am∣bition, Vanity, Hardness of Heart, and all those secret Affections of Mind that enter into the Composition of a Tyrant. At the same Time, she holds up to them a large Mirror, in which every one sees himself represented in the natural Horror and Deformity of his Character. On the other Side of them stands another Fury, that with an insulting Derision, repeats to them all the Praises that their Flatterers had bestowed upon them while they sat upon their respective Thrones. She too, says the Author, presents a Mirror before their Eyes, in which every one sees himself adorn'd with all those Beauties and Perfections in which they had been drawn by the Vanity of their own Hearts, and the Flattery of others. To punish them for the Wantonness of the Cruelty which they formerly exercised, they are now delivered up to be treated according to the Fancy and Caprice of several Slaves, who have here an Opportunity of tyrannizing in their Turns.</P>
<P>The Author having given us a Description of these ghastly Spectres, who, says he, are always calling upon Death, and are placed under the Distillation of that burning Vengeance which falls upon them Drop by Drop, and is never to be exhausted, leads us into a pleasing Scene of Groves, filled with the Melody of Birds, and the Odours of a Thousand different Plants. These Groves are represented as rising among a great
<PB N="209" REF="216"/>
many flowry Meadows, and watered with Streams that diffuse a perpetual Freshness, in the midst of an eternal Day, and a never-fading Spring. This, says the Author, was the Habitation of those good Princes who were Friends of the Gods, and Parents of the People. Among these, <HI>Telemachus</HI> converses with the Shade of one of his Ancestors, who makes a most agreeable Re∣lation of the Joys of <HI>Elysium,</HI> and the Nature of its Inhabitants. The Residence of <HI>Sesostris</HI> a∣mong these happy Shades, with his Character and present Employment, is drawn in a very lively Manner, and with a great Elevation of Thought.</P>
<P>The Description of that pure and gentle Light which overflows these happy Regions, and cloaths the Spirits of these virtuous Persons, hath something in it of that Enthusiasm which this Author was accused of by his Enemies in the Church of <HI>Rome;</HI> but however it may look in Religion, it makes a very beautiful Figure in Poetry.</P>
<P>The Rays of the Sun, says he, are Darkness in Comparison with this Light, which rather de∣serves the Name of Glory, than that of Light. It pierces the thickest Bodies, in the same Man∣ner as the Sun Beams pass through Chrystal: It strengthens the Sight instead of dazzling it; and nourishes in the most inward Recesses of the Mind, a perpetual Serenity that is not to be ex∣press'd. It enters and incorporates it self with the very Substance of the Soul: The Spirits of the Blessed feel it in all their Senses, and in all their Perceptions. It produces a certain Source of Peace and Joy that arises in them for ever, running through all the Faculties, and refresh∣ing all the Desires of the Soul. External Plea∣sures and Delights, with all their Charms and Allurements, are regarded with the utmost In∣difference
<PB N="210" REF="217"/>
and Neglect by these happy Spirits who have this great Principle of Pleasure with∣in them, drawing the whole Mind to its self, calling off their Attention from the most de∣lightful Objects, and giving them all the Tran∣sports of Inebriation, without the Confusion and the Folly of it.</P>
<P>I have here only mentioned some Master-Touches of this admirable Piece, because the Original it self is understood by the greater Part of my Readers. I must confess, I take a parti∣cular Delight in these Prospects of Futurity, whether grounded upon the probable Suggestions of a fine Imagination, or the more severe Con∣clusions of Philosophy; as a Man loves to hear all the Discoveries or Conjectures relating to a Foreign Country which he is, at some Time, to inhabit. Prospects of this Nature lighten the Burden of any present Evil, and refresh us under the worst and lowest Circumstances of Mortality. They extinguish in us both the Fear and Envy of Humane Grandeur. Insolence shrinks its Head, Power disappears; Pain, Po∣verty, and Death, fly before them. In short, the Mind that is habituated to the lively Sense of an Hereafter, can hope for what is the most terrifying to the Generality of Mankind, and re∣joice in what is the most afflicting.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>From my own Apartment, <DATE>April 10.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Was last Night in an Assembly of very Fine Women. How I came among them, is of no great Importance to the Reader. I shall only let him know, that I was betrayed into so good Com∣pany by the Device of an old Friend, who had promised to give some of his Female Acquain∣tance a Sight of Mr. <HI>Bickerstaff.</HI> Upon hearing my Name mentioned, a Lady who sat by me told me, they had brought together a Female Consort for my Entertainment. You must know, says she, that we all of us look upon our selves to be Mu∣sical Instruments, though we do not yet know of what Kind, which we hope to learn from you, if you will give us Leave to play before you. This was followed by a general Laugh, which I always look upon as a necessary Flourish in the Opening of a Female Consort. They then struck up toge∣ther, and play'd a whole Hour upon Two Grounds, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Trial,</HI> and the <HI>Opera.</HI> I could not but observe, that several of their Notes were more soft, and several more sharp, than any that ever I heard in a Male Consort; though I must con∣fess, there was not any Regard to Time, nor any of those Rests and Pauses which are frequent in the Harmony of the other Sex. Besides, that the Musick was generally full, and no particular In∣strument permitted to play long by its self.</P>
<P>I seemed so very well pleased with what every one said, and smiled with so much Complaisance
<PB N="212" REF="219"/>
at all their pretty Fancies, that though I did not put one Word into their Discourse, I have the Vanity to think, they looked upon me as very agreeable Company. I then told 'em, That if I were to draw the Picture of so many charming Musicians, it should be like one I had seen of the Muses, with their several Instruments in their Hands. Upon which the Lady Kettle-Drum tos∣sed back her Head, and cry'd, A very pretty Si∣mile! The Consort again revived; in which, with Nods, Smiles, and Approbations, I bore the Part rather of one who beats the Time, than of a Per∣former.</P>
<P>I was no sooner retired to my Lodgings, but I ran over in my Thoughts the several Characters of this Fair Assembly, which I shall give some Account of, because they are various in their Kind, and may each of them stand as a Sample of a whole Species.</P>
<P>The Person who pleased me most was a Flute, an Instrument that, without any great Compass, hath something exquisitely sweet and soft in its Sound: It lulls and sooths the Ear, and fills it with such a gentle Kind of Melody, as keeps the Mind awake without startling it, and raises a most agreeable Passion between Transport and Indo∣lence. In short, the Musick of the Flute is the Conversation of a mild and amiable Woman, that has nothing in it very elevated, or at the same Time any Thing mean or trivial.</P>
<P>I must here observe, that the Hautboy is the most perfect of the Flute-Species, which, with all the Sweetness of the Sound, hath a great Strength and Variety of Notes; though at the same Time I must observe, that the Hautboy in one Sex is as scarce as the Harpsicord in the other.</P>
<P>By the Side of the Flute there sat a Flageolet, for so I must call a certain young Lady, who fancying her self a Wit, despised the Musick of the Flute as low and insipid, and would be enter∣taining
<PB N="213" REF="220"/>
the Company with tart ill-natured Obser∣vations, pert Fancies, and little Turns, which she imagined to be full of Life and Spirit. The Fla∣geolet therefore doth not differ from the Flute so much in the Compass of its Notes, as in the Shril∣ness and Sharpness of the Sound. We must how∣ever take Notice, that the Flageolets among their own Sex are more valued and esteemed than the Flutes.</P>
<P>There chanced to be a Coquet in the Consort, that with a great many skittish Notes, affected Squeaks, and studied Inconsistencies, distinguish'd her self from the rest of the Company. She did not speak a Word during the whole <HI>Trial;</HI> but I thought she would never have done upon the <HI>Opera.</HI> One while she would break out upon, <HI>That hideous King!</HI> Then upon the charming Black-moor! Then, <HI>Oh that dear Lion!</HI> Then would hum over Two or Three Notes; then run to the Window to see what Coach was coming. The Coquet therefore I must distinguish by that Musical Instrument which is commonly known by the Name of a Kit, that is more jiggish than the Fiddle it self, and never sounds but to a Dance.</P>
<P>The Fourth Person who bore a Part in the Con∣versation was a Prude, who stuck to the Trial, and was silent upon the whole Opera. The Gravi∣ty of her Censures, and Composure of her Voice, which were often attended with supercilious Casts of the Eye, and a seeming Contempt for the Lightness of the Conversation, put me in Mind of that ancient serious Matron-like Instrument the Virginal.</P>
<P>I must not pass over in Silence a <HI>Lancashire</HI> Hornpipe, by which I would signify a young Country Lady, who with a great deal of Mirth and Innocence diverted the Company very agree∣ably; and, if I am not mistaken, by that Time the Wildness of her Notes is a little softened,
<PB N="214" REF="221"/>
and the Redundancy of her Musick restrained by Conversation and good Company, will be im∣proved into one of the most amiable Flutes about the Town. Your Romps and Boarding-School Girls fall likewise under this Denomination.</P>
<P>On the Right-Hand of the Hornpipe sat a <HI>Welsh</HI> Harp, an Instrument which very much delights in the Tunes of old Historical Ballads, and in ce∣lebrating the Renown'd Actions and Exploits of ancient <HI>British</HI> Heroes. By this Instrument I therefore would describe a certain Lady, who is one of those Female Historians that upon all Oc∣casions enters into Pedigrees and Descents, and finds her self related, by some Off-shoot or other, to almost every great Family in <HI>England:</HI> For which Reason she jarrs and is out of Tune very often in Conversation, for the Company's Want of due Attention and Respect to her.</P>
<P>But the most sonorous Part of our Consort was a She-Drum, or (as the Vulgar call it) a Kettle-Drum, who accompanied her Discourse with Motions of the Body, Tosses of the Head, and Brandishes of the Fan. Her Musick was loud, bold, and masculine. Every Thump she gave, alarmed the Company, and very often set some Body or other in it a Blushing.</P>
<P>The last I shall mention was a certain Roman∣tick Instrument called a <HI>Dulcimer,</HI> who talked of nothing but shady Woods, flowry Meadows, purling Streams, Larks and Nightingals, with all the Beauties of the Spring, and the Pleasures of a Country Life. This Instrument hath a fine melancholy Sweetness in it, and goes very well with the Flute.</P>
<P>I think most of the conversable Part of Wo∣mankind may be found under one of the forego∣ing Divisions; but it must be confessed, that the Generality of that Sex, notwithstanding they have naturally a great Genius for being talkative, are not Mistresses of more than one Note; with which
<PB N="215" REF="222"/>
however, by frequent Repetition, they make a greater Sound than those who are possessed of the whole Gammut, as may be observed in your La∣rums or Houshold Scolds, and in your Castanets or impertinent Tittle-Tattles, who have no other Variety in their Discourse but that of talking slower or faster.</P>
<P>Upon communicating this Scheme of Musick to an old Friend of mine, who was formerly a Man of Gallantry and a Rover, he told me, That he believed he had been in Love with every In∣strument in my Consort. The first that smit him was a Hornpipe, who lived near his Father's House in the Country; but upon his failing to meet her at an Assize, according to Appointment, she cast him off. His next Passion was for a Ket∣tle-Drum, whom he fell in Love with at a Play; but when he became acquainted with her, not finding the Softness of her Sex in her Conversa∣tion, he grew cool to her; though at the same Time he could not deny, but that she behaved her self very much like a Gentlewoman. His Third Mistress was a Dulcimer, who he found took great Delight in sighing and languishing, but would go no further than the Preface of Matri∣mony; so that she would never let a Lover have any more of her than her Heart, which, after ha∣ving won, he was forced to leave her, as despair∣ing of any further Success. I must confess, says my Friend, I have often considered her with a great deal of Admiration; and I find her Plea∣sure is so much in this first Step of an Amour, that her Life will pass away in Dream, Solitude, and Soliloquy, till her Decay of Charms makes her snatch at the worst Man that ever pretended to her. In the next Place, says my Friend, I fell in Love with a Kit, who led me such a Dance through all the Varieties of a familiar, cold, fond, and indifferent Behaviour, that the World began to grow censorious, though without any Cause.
<PB N="216" REF="223"/>
For which Reason, to recover our Reputations, we parted by Consent. To mend my Hand, says he, I made my next Application to a Virginal, who gave me great Encouragement, after her cautious Manner, till some malicious Companion told her of my long Passion for the Kit, which made her turn me off as a scandalous Fellow. At length, in Despair, (says he) I betook my self to a <HI>Welsh</HI> Harp, who rejected me with Contempt, after ha∣ving found that my Great Grandmother was a Brewer's Daughter. I found by the Sequel of my Friend's Discourse, that he had never aspired to a Hautboy; that he had been exasperated by a Fla∣geolet; and that to this very Day, he pines away for a Flute.</P>
<P>Upon the Whole, having throughly considered how absolutely necessary it is, That Two Instru∣ments, which are to play together for Life, should be exactly tuned, and go in perfect Consort with each other, I would propose Matches between the Musick of both Sexes, according to the following Table of Marriage. <LIST>

<P><HI>TOm Folio</HI> is a Broker in Learning, employed to get together good Editions, and stock the Libraries of great Men. There is not a Sale of Books begins till <HI>Tom Folio</HI> is seen at the Door. There is not an Auction where his Name is not heard, and that too in the very Nick of Time, in the Critical Moment, before the last decisive Stroke of the Hammer. There is not a Subscrip∣tion goes forward, in which <HI>Tom</HI> is not privy to the first rough Draught of the Proposals; nor a Catalogue printed, that doth not come to him wet from the Press. He is an universal Scholar, so far as the Title-Page of all Authors, knows the Manuscripts in which they were discovered, the Editions through which they have passed, with the Praises or Censures which they have received from the several Members of the Learned World. He has a greater Esteem for <HI>Aldus</HI> and <HI>Elzevir,</HI> than for <HI>Virgil</HI> and <HI>Horace.</HI> If you talk of <HI>Hero∣dotus,</HI> he breaks out into a Panegyrick upon <HI>Harry Stephans.</HI> He thinks he gives you an Ac∣count of an Author, when he tells you the Sub∣ject he treats of, the Name of the Editor, and the Year in which it was printed. Or if you draw him into further Particulars, he cries up the Good∣ness of the Paper, extols the Diligence of the Corrector, and is transported with the Beauty of the Letter. This he looks upon to be sound Learning and substantial Criticism. As for those
<PB N="218" REF="225"/>
who talk of the Fineness of Style, and the Just∣ness of Thought, or describe the Brightness of any particular Passages; nay, though they write themselves in the Genius and Spirit of the Author they admire, <HI>Tom</HI> looks upon them as Men of su∣perficial Learning, and flashy Parts.</P>
<P>I had Yesterday Morning a Visit from this learned Idiot, (for that is the Light in which I consider every Pedant) when I discovered in him some little Touches of the Coxcomb, which I had not before observ'd. Being very full of the Fi∣gure which he makes in the Republick of Letters, and wonderfully satisfied with his great Stock of Knowledge, he gave me broad Intimations, that he did not <HI>believe</HI> in all Points as his Forefathers had done. He then communicated to me a Thought of a certain Author upon a Passage of <HI>Virgil</HI>'s Account of the Dead, which I made the Subject of a late Paper. This Thought hath ta∣ken very much among Men of <HI>Tom</HI>'s Pitch and Understanding, though universally exploded by all that know how to construe <HI>Virgil,</HI> or have any Relish of Antiquity. Not to trouble my Reader with it, I found upon the whole, that <HI>Tom</HI> did not believe a future State of Rewards and Punish∣ments, because <HI>Aeneas,</HI> at his leaving the Empire of the Dead, passed through the Gate of Ivory, and not through that of Horn. Knowing that <HI>Tom</HI> had not Sense enough to give up an Opinion which he had once received, that he might avoid wrangling, I told him, That <HI>Virgil</HI> possibly had his Oversights as well as another Author.

in the Third <HI>Georgick,</HI> where you may find a Semicolon turned upside down. Perhaps, said I, these were not <HI>Virgil</HI>'s Thoughts, but those of the Transcriber. I do not design it, says <HI>Tom,</HI> as a Reflection on <HI>Virgil:</HI> On the contrary, I know that all the Manuscripts <HI>reclaim</HI> against such a Punctuation. Oh! Mr. <HI>Bickerstaff,</HI> says he, what would a Man give to see one Simile of <HI>Virgil</HI> writ in his own Hand? I asked him which was the Simile he meant; but was answered, Any Simile in <HI>Virgil.</HI> He then told me all the secret History in the Commonwealth of Learning; of Modern Pieces that had the Names of ancient Authors an∣nex'd to them; of all the Books that were now writing or printing in the several Parts of <HI>Europe;</HI> of many Amendments which are made, and not yet published; and a Thousand other Particulars, which I would not have my Memory burthen'd with for a Vatican.</P>
<P>At length, being fully persuaded that I tho∣roughly admired him, and looked upon him as a Prodigy of Learning, he took his Leave. I know several of <HI>Tom</HI>'s Class who are professed Admirers of <HI>Tasso</HI> without understanding a Word of <HI>Italian;</HI> and one in particular, that carries a <HI>Pastor-Fido</HI> in his Pocket, in which I am sure he is acquaint∣ed with no other Beauty but the Clearness of the Character.</P>
<P>There is another Kind of Pedant, who, with all <HI>Tom Folio</HI>'s Impertinencies, hath greater Super∣structures and Embellishments of <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Latin,</HI> and is still more insupportable than the other, in the same Degree as he is more learned. Of this Kind very often are Editors, Commentators, In∣terpreters, Scholiasts, and Criticks; and in short, all Men of deep Learning without common Sense. These Persons set a greater Value on themselves for having found out the Meaning of a Passage in <HI>Greek,</HI> than upon the Author for having written it; nay, will allow the Passage it self not to have
<PB N="220" REF="227"/>
any Beauty in it, at the same Time that they would be considered as the greatest Men of the Age for having interpreted it. They will look with Con∣tempt upon the most beautiful Poems that have been composed by any of their Contemporaries; but will lock themselves up in their Studies for a Twelvemonth together, to correct, publish, and expound, such Trifles of Antiquity as a modern Author would be contemn'd for. Men of the strictest Morals, severest Lives, and the gravest Professions, will write Volumes upon an idle Son∣net that is originally in <HI>Greek</HI> or <HI>Latin;</HI> give Edi∣tions of the most immoral Authors, and spin out whole Pages upon the various Readings of a lewd Expression. All that can be said in Excuse for them, is, That their Works sufficiently show they have no Tast of their Authors; and that what they do in this Kind, is out of their great Learn∣ing, and not out of any Levity or Lasciviousness of Temper.</P>
<P>A Pedant of this Nature is wonderfully well described in Six Lines of <HI>Boileau,</HI> with which I shall conclude his Character.</P>

<P>THE Wits of this Island, for above Fifty Years past, instead of correcting the Vices of the Age, have done all they could to inflame them. Marriage has been one of the common Topicks of Ridicule that every Stage-Scribbler hath found his Account in; for whenever there is an Occasion for a Clap, an impertinent Jest upon Matrimony is sure to raise it. This hath been attended with very pernicious Consequences. Many a Country 'Squire, upon his setting up for a Man of the Town, has gone Home in the Gaiety of his Heart and beat his Wife. A kind Husband hath been looked upon as a Clown, and a good Wife as a Domestick Animal, unfit for the Company or Conversation of the <HI>Beau Monde.</HI> In short, Sepa∣rate Beds, Silent Tables, and Solitary Homes, have been introduced by your Men of Wit and Pleasure of the Age.</P>
<P>As I shall always make it my Business to stem the Torrents of Prejudice and Vice, I shall take particular Care to put an honest Father of a Fa∣mily in Countenance, and endeavour to remove all the Evils out of that State of Life, which is either the most happy, or most miserable, that a Man can be placed in. In order to this, let us, if you please, consider the Wits and well-bred Per∣sons of former Times. I have shown in another Paper, That <HI>Pliny,</HI> who was a Man of the great∣est
<PB N="222" REF="229"/>
Genius, as well as of the First Quality of his Age, did not think it below nim to be a kind Husband, and to treat his Wife as a Friend, Com∣panion and Counsellor. I shall give the like In∣stance of another, who in all Respects was a much greater Man than <HI>Pliny,</HI> and hath written a whole Book of Letters to his Wife. They are not so full of Turns as those translated out of the former Author, who writes very much like a Modern, but are full of that beautiful Simplicity which is altogether natural, and is the distinguishing Cha∣racter of the best ancient Writers. The Author I am speaking of, is <HI>Cicero;</HI> who, in the follow∣ing Passages which I have taken out of his Let∣ters, shows, that he did not think it inconsistent with the Politeness of his Manners, or the Great∣ness of his Wisdom, to stand upon Record in his Domestick Character.</P>
<P>These Letters were written at a Time when he was banish'd from his Country, by a Faction that then prevail'd at <HI>Rome.</HI></P>
<LETTER>

<P>I Learn from the Letters of my Friends, as well as from common Report, that you give incredible Proofs of Virtue and Fortitude, and that you are indefatigable in all Kinds of good Offices. How unhappy a Man am I, that a Woman of your Virtue, Constancy, Honour, and good Nature, should fall into so great Distresses upon my Account; and that my dear <HI>Tulliola</HI> should be so much afflicted for the Sake of a Father, with whom she had once so much Rea¦son to be pleas'd!

If our present Fortune continues to oppress us, what will become of our poor Boy! My Tears flow so fast, that I am not able to write any further; and I would not willingly make you weep with me.—Let us take Care not to un∣do the Child that is already undone: If we can leave him any Thing, a little Virtue will keep him from Want, and a little Fortune raise him in the World. Mind your Health, and let me know frequently what you are doing.—Re∣member me to <HI>Tulliola</HI> and <HI>Cicero.</HI></P>

<P>DOn't fancy that I write longer Letters to any one than to your self, unless when I chance to receive a longer Letter from another, which I am indispensibly obliged to answer in every Particular. The Truth of it is, I have no Subject for a Letter at present; and as my Af∣fairs now stand, there is nothing more painful to me than Writing. As for you and our dear <HI>Tulliola,</HI> I cannot write to you without Abun∣dance of Tears, for I see both of you miserable, whom I always wished to be happy, and whom I ought to have made so.—I must acknow∣ledge, you have done every Thing for me with the utmost Fortitude, and the utmost Affection;

nor indeed is it more than I expected from you; though at the same Time it is a great Aggrava∣tion of my ill Fortune, that the Afflictions I suf∣fer can be relieved only by those which you un∣dergo for my Sake. For honest <HI>Valerius</HI> has written me a Letter, which I could not read without weeping very bitterly; wherein he gives me an Account of the publick Procession which you have made for me at <HI>Rome.</HI> Alas! my dearest Life, must then <HI>Terentia,</HI> the Darling of my Soul, whose Favour and Recommendations have been so often sought by others; must my <HI>Terentia</HI> droop under the Weight of Sorrow, appear in the Habit of a Mourner, pour out Floods of Tears, and all this for my Sake; for my Sake, who have undone my Family, by con∣sulting the Safety of others!—As for what you write about felling your House, I am very much afflicted, that what is laid out upon my Account may any way reduce you to Misery and Want. If we can bring about our Design, we may indeed recover every Thing; but if For∣tune persists in persecuting us, how can I think of your sacrificing for me the poor Remainder of your Possessions? No, my dearest Life, let me beg you to let those bear my Expences who are able, and perhaps willing to do it; and i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> you would show your Love to me, do not in¦jure your Health, which is already too much impaired.

<P><HI>ARistocritus</HI> hath delivered to me Three of your Letters, which I have almost defaced with my Tears. Oh! my <HI>Terentia,</HI> I am con∣sumed with Grief, and feel the Weight of your Sufferings more than of my own. I am more miserable than you are, notwithstanding you are very much so; and that for this Reason, because though our Calamity is common, it is my Fault that brought it upon us. I ought to have died rather than have been driven out of the City: I am therefore overwhelmed not only with Grief, but with Shame. I am ashamed that I did not do my utmost for the best of Wives, and the dearest of Children. You are ever pre∣sent before my Eyes in your Mourning, your Affliction, and your Sickness. Amidst all which, there scarce appears to me the least Glimmer∣ing of Hope.—However, as long as you hope, I will not despair.—I will do what you advise me. I have returned my Thanks to those Friends whom you mentioned, and have let them know, That you have acquainted me with their good Offices. I am sensible of <HI>Piso</HI>'s extraordinary Zeal and Endeavours to serve me. Oh! would the Gods grant that you and I might live together in the Enjoyment of such a Son-in-Law, and of our dear Children.—As for what you write of your coming to me if I desire it, I would rather you should be where you are, because I know you are my principal Agent at <HI>Rome.</HI> If you succeed, I shall come to you: If not—But I need say no more. Be careful of your Health, and be assured, that nothing is, or ever was, so dear to me as your self.

<P>I Don't write to you as often as I might, be∣cause notwithstanding I am afflicted at all Times, I am quite overcome with Sorrow whilst I am writing to you, or reading any Letters that I receive from you.—If these Evils are not to be removed, I must desire to see you, my dearest Life, as soon as possible, and to die in your Embraces; since neither the Gods, whom you always religiously worshipped; nor the Men, whose Good I always promoted, have rewarded us according to our Deserts.—What a distressed Wretch am I? Should I ask a weak Woman, oppressed with Cares and Sickness, to come and live with me, or shall I not ask her? Can I live without you? But I find I must. If there be any Hopes of my Return, help it for∣ward, and promote it as much as you are able. But if all that is over, as I fear it is, find out some Way or other of coming to me.

Methinks it is a Pleasure to see this great Man in his Family, who makes so different a Figure in the <HI>Forum</HI> or Senate of <HI>Rome.</HI> Every one admires the Orator and the Consul; but for my Part, I esteem the Husband and the Father. His private Character, with all the little Weaknesses of Hu∣manity, is as amiable, as the Figure he makes in publick is awful and majestick. But at the same Time that I love to surprise so great an Author in his private Walks, and to survey him in his most familiar Lights, I think it would be barbarous to form to our selves any Idea of mean Spiritedness from these natural Openings of his Heart, and disburthening of his Thoughts to a Wife. He has written several other Letters to the same Per∣son, but none with so great Passion as these of which I have given the foregoing Extracts.</P>
<P>It would be ill Nature not to acquaint the <HI>English</HI> Reader, that his Wife was successful in her Solicitations for this great Man, and saw her Husband return to the Honours of which he had been depriv'd, with all the Pomp and Ac∣clamation that usually attended the greatest Tri∣umph.</P>

<P>A Common Civility to an impertinent Fellow often draws upon one a great many unfore∣seen Troubles; and if one doth not take particu∣lar Care, will be interpreted by him as an Over∣ture of Friendship and Intimacy. This I was very sensible of this Morning. About Two Hours be∣fore
<PB N="228" REF="235"/>
Day, I heard a great Rapping at my Door, which continued some Time, till my Maid could get her self ready to go down and see what was the Occasion of it. She then brought me up Word, That there was a Gentleman who seemed very much in Haste, and said he must needs speak with me. By the Description she gave me of him, and by his Voice, which I could hear as I lay in my Bed, I fancied him to be my old Acquaintance the Upholsterer, whom I met the other Day in St. <HI>James</HI>'s-<HI>Park.</HI> For which Reason, I bid her tell the Gentleman, whoever he was, That I was indisposed, that I could see no Body, and that, if he had any Thing to say to me, I desired he would leave it in Writing. My Maid, after having delivered her Message, told me, That the Gentle∣man said he would stay at the next Coffee-house till I was stirring, and bid her be sure to tell me, That the <HI>French</HI> were driven from the <HI>Scarp,</HI> and that <HI>Douay</HI> was invested. He gave her the Name of another Town, which I found she had drop∣ped by the Way.</P>
<P>As much as I love to be informed of the Suc∣cess of my brave Countrymen, I do not care for hearing of a Victory before Day, and was there∣fore very much out of Humour at this unseasona∣ble Visit. I had no sooner recovered my Temper, and was falling asleep, but I was immediately startled by a Second Rap; and upon my Maid's opening the Door, heard the same Voice ask her, If her Master was yet up? and at the same Time bid her tell me, That he was come on Purpose to talk with me about a Piece of Home-News that every Body in Town will be full of Two Hours hence. I ordered my Maid as soon as she came into the Room, without hearing her Message, to tell the Gentleman, That whatever his News is, I would rather hear it Two Hours hence than now; and that I persisted in my Resolution not to speak with any Body that Morning. The
<PB N="229" REF="236"/>
Wench delivered my Answer presently, and shut the Door. It was impossible for me to compose my self to Sleep after Two such unexpected Alarms; for which Reason I put on my Clothes in a very peevish Humour. I took several Turns about my Chamber, reflecting with a great deal of Anger and Contempt on these Volunteers in Politicks, that undergo all the Pain, Watchful∣ness, and Disquiet of a First Minister, without turning it to the Advantage either of themselves or their Country; and yet it is surprising to con∣sider how numerous this Species of Men is. There is nothing more frequent than to find a Taylor breaking his Rest on the Affairs of <HI>Europe,</HI> and to see a Cluster of Porters sitting upon the Ministry. Our Streets swarm with Politicians, and there is scarce a Shop which is not held by a Statesman. As I was musing after this Manner, I heard the Upholsterer at the Door delivering a Letter to my Maid, and begging her, in a very great Hurry, to give it to her Master as soon as ever he was awake, which I opened, and found as follows:</P>
<LETTER>

But this is not my present Business. If you remember, I whispered a Word in your Ear as we were walking up the <HI>Mall,</HI> and you see what has happened since. If I had seen you this Morning. I would have told you in your Ear another Secret. I hope you will be recovered of your Indisposition by to Morrow Morning, when I will wait on you at the same Hour as I did this; my private Circumstances being such, that I cannot well appear in this Quarter of the Town after it is Day.</P>
<P>I have been so taken up with the late good News from <HI>Holland,</HI> and Expectation of further Particulars, as well as with other Transactions, of which I will tell you more to Morrow Morn∣ing, that I have not slept a Wink these Three Nights.</P>

<P>I fancied my self among the <HI>Alpes,</HI> and, as it is natural in a Dream, seemed every Moment to bound from one Summit to another, till at last, after having made this Airy Progress over the Tops of several Mountains, I arrived at the very Centre of those broken Rocks and Precipices. I here, methought, faw a prodigious Circuit of Hills, that reached above the Clouds, and encom∣passed a large Space of Ground, which I had a great Curiosity to look into. I thereupon conti∣nued my former Way of travelling through a great Variety of Winter Scenes, till I had gained the Top of these white Mountains, which seem∣ed another <HI>Alpes</HI> of Snow. I looked down from hence into a spacious Plain, which was surround∣ed on all Sides by this Mound of Hills, and which presented me with the most agreeable Prospect I had ever seen. There was a greater Variety of Colours in the Embroidery of the Meadows, a more lively Green in the Leaves and Grass, a brighter Chrystal in the Streams, than what I ever met with in any other Region. The Light it self had something more shining and glorious in it than that of which the Day is made in other Places. I was wonderfully astonished at the Dis∣covery of such a Paradise amidst the Wildness of those cold, hoary Landskips which lay about it; but found at length, that this happy Region was inhabited by the Goddess of <HI>Liberty;</HI> whose Pre∣sence softened the Rigours of the Climate, en∣riched
<PB N="234" REF="241"/>
the Barrenness of the Soil, and more than supplied the Absence of the Sun. The Place was covered with a wonderful Profusion of Flowers, that without being disposed into regular Borders and Parterres, grew promiscuously, and had a greater Beauty in their natural Luxuriancy and Disorder, than they could have received from the Checks and Restraints of Art. There was a Ri∣ver that arose out of the South Side of the Moun∣tain, that by an infinite Number of Turns and Windings, seemed to visit every Plant, and che∣rish the several Beauties of the Spring, with which the Fields abounded. After having run to and fro in a wonderful Variety of Meanders, as unwilling to leave so charming a Place, it at last throws it self into the Hollow of a Moun∣tain, from whence it passes under a long Range of Rocks, and at length rises in that Part of the <HI>Alpes</HI> where the Inhabitants think it the First Source of the <HI>Rhone.</HI> This River, after having made its Progress through those free Nations, stagnates in a huge Lake at the leaving of them, and no sooner enters into the Regions of Slavery, but runs through them with an incredible Rapi∣dity, and takes its shortest Way to the Sea.</P>
<P>I descended into the happy Fields that lay be∣neath me, and in the midst of them, beheld the Goddess fitting upon a Throne. She had no∣thing to enclose her but the Bounds of her own Dominions, and nothing over her Head but the Heavens. Every Glance of her Eye cast a Track of Light where it fell, that revived the Spring, and made all Things smile about her. My Heart grew chearful at the Sight of her, and as she look∣ed upon me, I found a certain Confidence grow∣ing in me, and such an inward Resolution as I never felt before that Time.</P>
<P>On the Left Hand of the Goddess sat the Ge∣nius of a Commonwealth, with the Cap of Li∣berty on her Head, and in her Hand a Wand
<PB N="235" REF="242"/>
like that with which a <HI>Roman</HI> Citizen used to give his Slaves their Freedom. There was something mean and vulgar, but at the same Time exceed∣ing bold and daring, in her Air; her Eyes were full of Fire, but had in them such Casts of Fierce∣ness and Cruelty, as made her appear to me ra∣ther dreadful than amiable. On her Shoulders she wore a Mantle, on which there was wrought a great Confusion of Figures. As it flew in the Wind, I could not discern the particular Design of them, but saw Wounds in the Bodies of some, and Agonies in the Faces of others; and over one Part of it could read in Letters of Blood, <HI>The Ides of March.</HI></P>
<P>On the Right Hand of the Goddess was the Genius of Monarchy. She was cloathed in the whitest Ermin, and wore a Crown of the purest Gold upon her Head. In her Hand she held a Scepter like that which is born by the <HI>British</HI> Monarchs. A Couple of tame Lions lay crouch∣ing at her Feet: Her Countenance had in it a very great Majesty without any Mixture of Ter∣ror: Her Voice was like the Voice of an Angel, filled with so much Sweetness, and accompanied with such an Air of Condescention, as tempered the Awfulness of her Appearance, and equally in∣spired Love and Veneration into the Hearts of all that beheld her.</P>
<P>In the Train of the Goddess of <HI>Liberty</HI> were the several Arts and Sciences, who all of them flourished underneath her Eye. One of them in particular made a greater Figure than any of the rest, who held a Thunderbolt in her Hand, which had the Power of melting, piercing, or breaking every Thing that stood in its Way. The Name of this Goddess was <HI>Eloquence.</HI></P>
<P>There were Two other dependent Goddesses, who made a very conspicuous Figure in this bliss∣ful Region. The First of them was seated upon an Hill, that had every Plant growing out of it,
<PB N="236" REF="243"/>
which the Soil was in its own Nature capable of producing. The Other was seated in a little Island, that was covered with Groves of Spices, Olives, and Orange-Trees; and in a Word, with the Products of every Foreign Clime. The Name of the First was <HI>Plenty,</HI> of the Second <HI>Commerce.</HI> The First leaned her Right Arm upon a Plough, and under her Left held a huge Horn, out of which she poured a whole Autumn of Fruits. The Other wore a rostral Crown upon her Head, and kept her Eyes fixed upon a Com∣pass.</P>
<P>I was wonderfully pleased in ranging through this delightful Place, and the more so, because it was not incumbered with Fences and Enclo∣sures; till at length, methoughts, I sprung from the Ground, and pitched upon the Top of an Hill, that presented several Objects to my Sight which I had not before taken Notice of. The Winds that pass'd over this flowry Plain, and through the Tops of the Trees which were full of Blossoms, blew upon me in such a continued Breeze of Sweets, that I was wonderfully charm∣ed with my Situation. I here saw all the inner Declivities of that great Circuit of Mountains, whose Outside was covered with Snow, over∣grown with huge Forrests of Fir-Trees, which indeed are very frequently found in other Parts of the <HI>Alpes.</HI> These Trees were inhabited by Storks, that came thither in great Flights from very distant Quarters of the World. Methoughts, I was pleased in my Dream to see what became of these Birds, when, upon leaving the Places to which they make an annual Visit, they rise in great Flocks so high till they are out of Sight; and for that Reason have been thought by some modern Philosophers to take a Flight to the Moon. But my Eyes were soon diverted from this Prospect, when I observed Two great Gaps that led thro' this Circuit of Mountains, where
<PB N="237" REF="244"/>
Guards and Watches were posted Day and Night. Upon Examination I found, that there were Two formidable Enemies encamped before each of these Avenues, who kept the Place in a perpetual Alarm, and watched all Opportunities of inva∣ding it.</P>
<P><HI>Tyranny</HI> was at the Head of one of these Armies, dressed in an Eastern Habit, and grasping in her Hand an Iron Scepter. Behind her was <HI>Barbarity,</HI> with the Garb and Complexion of an <HI>Aethiopian; Ignorance</HI> with a Turbant upon her Head; and <HI>Persecution</HI> holding up a bloody Flag, embroide∣red with Flower-de-Luces. These were followed by <HI>Oppression, Poverty, Famine, Torture,</HI> and a dreadful Train of Appearances, that made me tremble to behold them. Among the Baggage of this Army, I could discover Racks, Wheels, Chains, and Gibbets, with all the Instruments Art could invent to make humane Nature miserable.</P>
<P>Before the other Avenue I saw <HI>Licentiousness,</HI> dressed in a Garment not unlike the <HI>Polish</HI> Cas∣sock, and leading up an whole Army of Monsters, such as <HI>Clamour,</HI> with a hoarse Voice and a Hun∣dred Tongues; <HI>Confusion,</HI> with a mishapen Body and a Thousand Heads; <HI>Impudence,</HI> with a Fore∣head of Brass; and <HI>Rapine,</HI> with Hands of Iron. The Tumult, Noise, and Uproar in this Quarter, were so very great, that they disturbed my Ima∣gination more than is consistent with Sleep, and by that Means awaked me.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="article">
<OPENER><DATELINE>From my own Apartment, <DATE>April 21.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>IN my younger Years I used many Endeavours to get a Place at Court, and indeed conti∣nued my Pursuits till I arrived at my <HI>Grand Cli∣macterick:</HI> But at length altogether despairing of Success, whether it were for Want of Capacity, Friends, or due Application, I at last resolved to erect a new Office, and for my Encouragement, to place my self in it. For this Reason, I took upon me the Title and Dignity of <HI>Censor</HI> of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> reserving to my self all such Perquisites, Profits, and Emoluments, as should arise out of the Discharge of the said Office. These in Truth have not been inconsiderable; for, besides those Weekly Contributions which I receive from <HI>John Morphew,</HI> and those annual Subscriptions which I propose to my self from the most ele∣gant Part of this great Island, I daily live in a very comfortable Affluence of Wine, Stale Beer, <HI>Hungary</HI> Water, Beef, Books, and Marrow-Bones, which I receive from many well-disposed Citi∣zens; not to mention the Forfeitures which ac∣crue to me from the several Offenders that ap∣pear before me on Court-Days.</P>
<P>Having now enjoyed this Office for the Space of a Twelvemonth, I shall do what all good Of∣ficers ought to do, take a Survey of my Beha∣viour, and consider carefully, whether I have discharged my Duty, and acted up to the Chara∣cter with which I am invested. For my Dire¦ction
<PB N="239" REF="246"/>
in this Particular, I have made a narrow Search into the Nature of the old <HI>Roman Censors,</HI> whom I must always regard, not only as my Predecessors, but as my Patterns in this great Employment; and have several Times asked my own Heart with great Impartiality, Whether <HI>Cato</HI> will not bear a more venerable Figure among Posterity than <HI>Bickerstaff.</HI></P>
<P>I find the Duty of the <HI>Roman Censor</HI> was Two∣fold. The first Part of it consisted in making frequent Reviews of the People, in casting up their Numbers, ranging them under their seve∣ral Tribes, disposing them into proper Classes, and subdividing them into their respective Cen∣turies.</P>
<P>In Compliance with this Part of the Office, I have taken many curious Surveys of this great City. I have collected into particular Bodies the <HI>Dappers</HI> and the <HI>Smarts,</HI> the <HI>Natural</HI> and <HI>Affected Rakes,</HI> the <HI>Pretty Fellows</HI> and the <HI>very pretty Fel∣lows.</HI> I have likewise drawn out in several di∣stinct Parties your <HI>Pedants</HI> and <HI>Men of Fire,</HI> your <HI>Gamesters</HI> and <HI>Politicians.</HI> I have separated <HI>Cits</HI> from <HI>Citizens, Free-Thinkers</HI> from <HI>Philosophers, Wits</HI> from <HI>Snuff-Takers,</HI> and <HI>Duellists</HI> from <HI>Men of Honour.</HI> I have likewise made a Calculation of <HI>Esquires,</HI> not only considering the several distinct Swarms of them that are settled in the different Parts of this Town, but also that more rugged Species that inhabit the Fields and Woods, and are often found in Pot-houses, and upon Hay∣cocks.</P>
<P>I shall pass the Soft Sex over in Silence, having not yet reduced them into any tolerable Order; as likewise the softer Tribe of Lovers, which will cost me a great deal of Time, before I shall be able to cast them into their several Centuries and Sub-divisions.</P>
<P>The Second Part of the <HI>Roman Censor</HI>'s Office was to look into the Manners of the People, and
<PB N="240" REF="247"/>
to check any growing Luxury, whether in Diet, Dress, or Building. This Duty likewise I have endeavoured to discharge, by those wholesome Precepts which I have given my Countrymen in regard to Beef and Mutton, and the severe Censures which I have passed upon Ragouts and Frigacies. There is not, as I am informed, a Pair of Red Heols to be seen within Ten Miles of <HI>London,</HI> which I may likewise ascribe, with∣out Vanity, to the becoming Zeal which I ex∣pressed in that Particular. I must own, my Suc∣cess with the Petticoat is not so great: But as I have not yet done with it, I hope I shall in a little Time put an effectual Stop to that grow∣ing Evil. As for the Article of Building, I in∣tend hereafter to enlarge upon it, having lately observed several Ware-houses, nay private Shops, that stand upon <HI>Corinthian</HI> Pillars, and whole Rows of Tin Pots showing themselves, in order to their Sale, through a Sash-Window.</P>
<P>I have likewise followed the Example of the <HI>Roman</HI> Censors, in punishing Offences accord∣ing to the Quality of the Offender. It was usual for them to expel a Senator who had been guilty of great Immoralities out of the Senate-House, by omitting his Name when they called over the List of his Brethren. In the same Manner, to remove effectually several worthless Men who stand possessed of great Honours, I have made frequent Draughts of dead Men out of the vi∣cious Part of the Nobility, and given them up to the new Society of Upholders, with the neces∣sary Orders for their Interrment. As the <HI>Roman Censors</HI> used to punish the Knights or Gentlemen of <HI>Rome,</HI> by taking away their Horses from them, I have seised the Canes of many Crimi∣nals of Figure, whom I had just Reason to animadvert upon. As for the Offenders among the Common People of <HI>Rome,</HI> they were gene∣rally chastised, by being thrown out of a higher
<PB N="241" REF="248"/>
Tribe, and placed in one which was not so ho∣nourable. My Reader cannot but think I have had an Eye to this Punishment, when I have de∣graded one Species of Men into Bombs, Squibs, and Crackers, and another into Drums, Bass-Viols, and Bagpipes; not to mention whole Packs of Delinquents whom I have shut up in Kennels, and the new Hospital which I am at present erecting, for the Reception of those my Countrymen who give me but little Hopes of their Amendment, on the Borders of <HI>Moor-Fields.</HI> I shall only observe upon this last Particular. That since some late Surveys I have taken of this Island, I shall think it necessary to enlarge the Plan of the Buildings which I design in this Quarter.</P>
<P>When my great Predecessor <HI>Cato</HI> the Elder stood for the Censorship of <HI>Rome,</HI> there were se∣veral other Competitors who offered themselves; and to get an Interest among the People, gave them great Promises of the mild and gentle Treat∣ment which they would use towards them in that Office. <HI>Cato</HI> on the contrary told them, he presented himself as a Candidate, because he knew the Age was sunk in Immorality and Cor∣ruption; and that if they would give him their Votes, he would promise them to make use of such a Strictness and Severity of Discipline as should recover them out of it. The <HI>Roman</HI> Historians, upon this Occasion, very much cele∣brate the Publick-Spiritedness of that People, who chose <HI>Cato</HI> for their Censor, notwithstand∣ing his Method of recommending himself. I may in some Measure extol my own Country∣men upon the same Account, who, without any Rrspect to Party, or any Application from my self, have made such generous Subscriptions for the Censor of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> as will give e Mag∣nificence to my old Age, and which I esteem more than I would any Post in <HI>Europe</HI> of an Hundred
<PB N="242" REF="249"/>
Times the Value. I shall only add, That upon looking into my Catalogue of Subscribers, which I intend to print Alphabetically in the Front of my Lucubrations, I find the Names of the great∣est Beauties and Wits in the whole Island of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> which I only mention for the Be∣nefit of any of them who have not yet subscribed, it being my Design to close the Subscription in a very short Time.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>Will's Coffee-house, <DATE>April 24.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Yesterday came hither about Two Hours be∣fore the Company generally make their Ap∣pearance, with a Design to read over all the News-Papers; but upon my sitting down, I was accosted by <HI>Ned Softly,</HI> who saw me from a Corner in the other End of the Room, where I found he had been writing something. Mr. <HI>Bicker∣staff,</HI> says he, I observe by a late Paper of yours, that you and I are just of a Humour; for you mu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t know, of all Impertinencies, there is no∣thing which I so much hate as News. I never read a <HI>Gazette</HI> in my Life; and never trouble
<PB N="243" REF="250"/>
my Head about our Armies, whether they win or lose, or in what Part of the World they he encamped. Without giving me Time to reply, he drew a Paper of Verses out of his Pocket, telling me, That he had something which would entertain me more agreeably, and that he would desire my Judgment upon every Line, for that we had Time enough before us till the Company came in.</P>
<P><HI>Ned Softly</HI> is a very pretty Poet, and a great Admirer of easy Lines. <HI>Waller</HI> is his Favourite: And as that admirable Writer has the best and worst Verses of any among our great <HI>English</HI> Poets, <HI>Ned Softly</HI> has got all the bad Ones with∣out Book, which he repeats upon Occasion, to show his Reading, and garnish his Conversation. <HI>Ned</HI> is indeed a true <HI>English</HI> Reader, incapable of relishing the great and masterly Strokes of this Art; but wonderfully pleased with the little <HI>Gothick</HI> Ornaments of Epigrammatical Conceits, Turns, Points, and Quibbles, which are so fre∣quent in the most admired of our <HI>English</HI> Poets, and practised by those who want Genius and Strength to represent, after the Manner of the Ancients, Simplicity in its natural Beauty and Perfection.</P>
<P>Finding my self unavoidably engaged in such a Conversation, I was resolved to turn my Pain into a Pleasure, and to divert my self as well as I could with so very odd a Fellow. You must understand, says <HI>Ned,</HI> that the Sonnet I am go ng to read to you was written upon a Lady, wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> shewed me some Verses of her own making, and is perhaps the best Poet of our Age. But you shall hear it. Upon which he begun to read as fol∣lows:</P>
<Q><PB N="244" REF="251"/>
To <HI>Mira,</HI> on her incomparable Poems.<LG N="1">
<HEAD>1.</HEAD>
<L>When dress'd in Lawrel Wreaths you shine,</L>
<L>And tune your soft melodious Notes,</L>
<L>You seem a Sister of the Nine,</L>
<L>Or <HI>Phoebus</HI> self in Petticoats.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="2">

<L>I fancy, when your Song you sing,</L>
<L>(Your Song you sing with so much Art)</L>
<L>Your Pen was pluck'd from <HI>Cupid</HI>'s Wing;</L>
<L>For ah! it wounds me like his Dart.</L>
</LG></Q>
<P>Why, says I, this is a little Nosegay of Con∣ceits, a very Lump of Salt: Every Verse hath something in it that piques; and then the Dart in the last Line is certainly as pretty a Sting in the Tail of an Epigram (for so I think your Criticks call it) as ever entered into the Thought of a Poet. Dear Mr. <HI>Bickerstaff,</HI> says he, shaking me by the Hand, every Body knows you to be a Judge of these Things; and to tell you truly, I read over <HI>Roscommon</HI>'s Translation of <HI>Horace</HI>'s <HI>Art of Poetry</HI> Three several Times, before I sat down to write the Sonnet which I have shown you. But you shall hear it again, and pray ob∣serve every Line of it, for not one of them shall pass without your Approbation.</P>
<Q><L>When dress'd in Lawrel Wreaths you shine.</L></Q>
<P>That is, says he, when have your Garland on; when you are Writing Verses. To which I replied, I know your Meaning: A Metaphor! The same, said he, and went on.</P>
<Q><L>And tune your soft melodious Notes.</L></Q>
<P>Pray observe the Gliding of that Verse; there is scarce a Consonant in it: I took Care to make it run upon Liquids. Give me your Opinion of
<PB N="245" REF="252"/>
it. Truly, said I, I think it as good as the former. I am very glad to hear you say so, says he; but mind the next.</P>
<Q><L>You seem a Sister of the Nine.</L></Q>
<P>That is, says he, you seem a Sister of the Muses; for if you look into ancient Authors, you will find it was their Opinion, that there were Nine of them. I remember it very well, said I; but pray proceed.</P>
<Q><L>Or <HI>Phoebus</HI> self in Petticoats.</L></Q>
<P><HI>Phoebus,</HI> says he, was the God of Poetry. These little Instances, Mr. <HI>Bickerstaff,</HI> show a Gentleman's Reading. Then to take off from the Air of Learning, which <HI>Phoebus</HI> and the Muses have given to this first Stanza, you may observe, how it falls all of a sudden into the Familiar; <HI>in Petticoats!</HI></P>
<Q><L>Or <HI>Phoebus</HI> self in Petticoats.</L></Q>
<P>Let us now, says I, enter upon the Second Stanza. I find the First Line is still a Continua∣tion of the Metaphor.</P>
<Q><L>I fancy, when your Song you sing,</L></Q>
<P>It is very right, says he; but pray observe the Turn of Words in those Two Lines. I was a whole Hour in adjusting of them, and have still a Doubt upon me, Whether in the Second Line it should be, <HI>Your Song you sing;</HI> or, <HI>You sing your Song?</HI> You shall hear them both:<Q><L>I fancy, when your Song you sing,</L>
<L>(Your Song you sing with so much Art.)</L></Q>
OR,
<Q><L>I fancy, when your Song you sing,</L>
<L>You sing your Song with so much Art.</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="246" REF="253"/>
Truly, said I, the Turn is so natural either Way, that you have made me almost giddy with it. Dear Sir, said he, grasping me by the Hand, you have a great deal of Patience; but pray what do you think of the next Verse?</P>
<Q><L>Your Pen was pluck'd from Cupid's Wing.</L></Q>
<P>Think! says I; I think you have made <HI>Cupid</HI> look like a little Goose. That was my Meaning, says he; I think the Ridicule is well enough hit off But we now come to the last, which sums up the whole Matter:</P>
<Q><L>For Ah! it wounds me like his Dart.</L></Q>
<P>Pray how do you like that <HI>Ah!</HI> Doth it not make a pretty Figure in that Place? <HI>Ah!</HI> It looks as if I felt the Dart, and cried out at being pricked with it.</P>
<Q><L>For Ah! it wounds me like his Dart.</L></Q>
<P>My Friend <HI>Dick Easy,</HI> continued he, assured me, he would rather have written that <HI>Ah!</HI> than to have been the Author of the <HI>Aeneid.</HI> He in∣deed objected, that I made <HI>Mira</HI>'s Pen like a Quill in one of the Lines, and like a Dart in the other. But as to that—Oh! as to that, says I, it is but supposing <HI>Cupid</HI> to be like a Porcupine, and his Quills and Darts will be the same Thing. He was going to embrace me for the Hint; but half a Dozen Criticks coming into the Room, whose Faces he did not like, he conveyed the Sonnet into his Pocket, and whispered me in the Ear, he would show it me again as soon as his Man had written it over fair.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>From my own Apartment <DATE>April 26.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE lately been looking over the many Pacquets of Letters which I have received from all Quarters of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> as well as from Foreign Countries, since my entring upon the Office of <HI>Censor,</HI> and indeed am very much sur∣prized to see so great a Number of them, and pleased to think that I have so far encreased the Revenue of the <HI>Post-Office.</HI> As this Collection will grow daily, I have digested it into several Bundles, and made proper Endorsements on each particular Letter, it being my Design, when I lay down the Work that I am now engaged in, to erect a Paper Office, and give it to the Publick.</P>
<P>I could not but make several Observations upon reading over the Letters of my Correspondents: As first of all, on the different Tasts that reign in the different Parts of this City. I find, by the Approbations which are given me, That I am seldom famous on the same Days on both Sides of <HI>Temple-Bar;</HI> and that when I am in the great∣est Repute within the Liberties, I dwindle at the Court End of the Town. Sometimes I sink in both these Places at the same Time; but for my Comfort, my Name hath then been up in the Districts of <HI>Wapping</HI> and <HI>Rotherhithe.</HI> Some of
<PB N="248" REF="255"/>
my Correspondents desire me to be always se∣rious, and others to be always merry. Some of them entreat me to go to Bed and fall into a Dream, and like me better when I am asleep than when I am awake: Others advise me to fit all Night upon the Stars, and be more fre∣quent in my Astrological Observations; for that a Vision is not properly a Lucubration. Some of my Readers thank me for filling my Paper with the Flowers of Antiquity, others desire News from <HI>Flanders.</HI> Some approve my Criticisms on the Dead, and others my Censures on the Living. For this Reason, I once resolved in the new Edi∣tion of my Works, to range my several Pa∣pers under distinct Heads, according as their principal Design was to benefit and instruct the different Capacities of my Readers, and to follow the Example of some very great Au∣thors, by writing at the Head of each Discourse, <HI>Ad Aulam, Ad Academiam, Ad Populum, Ad Clerum.</HI></P>
<P>There is no Particular in which my Correspon∣dents of all Ages, Conditions, Sexes, and Com∣plexions, universally agree, except only in their Thirst after Scandal. It is impossible to conceive how many have recommended their Neighbours to me upon this Account, or how unmercifully I have been abused by several unknown Hands, for not publishing the secret Histories of Cuckol∣dom that I have received from almost every Street in Town.</P>
<P>It would indeed be very dangerous for me to read over the many Praises and Eulogiums which come Post to me from all the Corners of the Nation, were they not mixed with many Checks, Reprimands, Scurrilities, and Re∣proaches, which several of my good-natured Countrymen cannot forbear sending me, though it often costs them Two-pence or a Groat before they can convey them to my Hands: So that
<PB N="249" REF="256"/>
sometimes when I am put into the best Humour in the World, after having read a Panegyrick upon my Performance, and looked upon my self as a Benefactor to the <HI>British</HI> Nation, the next Letter perhaps I open, begins with, <HI>You old Do∣ting Scoundrel—Are not you a sad Dog—Sirrah, you deserve to have your Nose slit.</HI> And the like ingenious Conceits. These little Mortifications are necessary to surpass that Pride and Vanity which naturally arise in the Mind of a received Author, and enable me to bear the Reputation which my courteous Readers bestow upon me, without becoming a Coxcomb by it. It was for the same Reason, that when a <HI>Roman</HI> Gene∣ral entered the City in the Pomp of a Triumph, the Commonwealth allowed of several little Drawbacks to his Reputation, by conniving at such of the Rabble as repeated Libels and Lam∣poons upon him within his Hearing, and by that Means engaged his Thoughts upon his Weakness and Imperfections, as well as on the Merits that advanced him to so great Honours. The Con∣queror however was not the less esteemed for being a Man in some Particulars, because he ap∣peared as a God in others.</P>
<P>There is another Circumstance in which my Countrymen have dealt very perversely with me; and that is, in Searching not only into my own Life, but also into the Lives of my Ancestors. If there has been a Blot in my Family for these Ten Generations, it hath been discovered by some or other of my Correspondents. In short, I find the ancient Family of the <HI>Bickerstaffs</HI> has suffered very much through the Malice and Prejudice of my Enemies. Some of them twit me in the Teeth with the Conduct of my Aunt <HI>Margery:</HI> Nay, there are some who have been so disinge∣nuous, as to throw <HI>Maud</HI> the Milk-Maid into my Dish, notwithstanding I my self was the first who discovered that Alliance. I reap however
<PB N="250" REF="257"/>
many Benefits from the Malice of these my Ene∣mies, as they let me see my own Faults, and give me a View of my self in the worst Light; as they hinder me from being blown up by Flattery and Self-Conceit: as they make me keep a watchful Eye over my own Actions, and at the same Time make me cautious how I talk of others, and par∣ticularly of my Friends and Relations, or value my self upon the Antiquity of my Family.</P>
<P>But the most formidable Part of my Correspon∣dents are those whose Letters are filled with Threats and Menaces. I have been treated so often after this Manner, that not thinking it suf∣ficient to fence well, in which I am now arrived at the utmost Perfection, and carry Pistols about me, which I have always tuck'd within my Gir∣dle; I several Months since made my Will, set∣tled my Estate, and took Leave of my Friends, looking upon my self as no better than a dead Man. Nay, I went so far as to write a long Let∣ter to the most intimate Acquaintance I have in the World, under the Character of a departed Person, giving him an Account of what brought me to that untimely End, and of the Fortitude with which I met it. This Letter being too long for the present Paper, I intend to print it by it self very suddenly; and at the same Time I must confess, I took my Hint of it from the Be∣haviour of an old Soldier in the Civil Wars, who was Corporal of a Company in a Regiment of Foot, about the same Time that I my self was a Cadet in the King's Army.</P>
<P>This Gentleman was taken by the Enemy; and the Two Parties were upon such Terms at that Time, that we did not treat each other as Prisoners of War, but as Traitors and Rebels. The poor Corporal being condemned to die, wrote a Letter to his Wife when under Sentence of Exe∣cution. He writ on the <HI>Thursday,</HI> and was to be executed on the <HI>Friday:</HI> But considering that the
<PB N="251" REF="258"/>
Letter would not come to his Wife's Hands till <HI>Saturday,</HI> the Day after Execution, and being at that Time more scrupulous than ordinary in speaking exact Truth, he formed his Letter ra∣ther according to the Posture of his Affairs when she should read it, than as they stood when he sent it: Though it must be confessed, there is a certain Perplexity in the Style of it, which the Reader will easily pardon, considering his Cir∣cumstances.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Wife,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HOping you are in good Health, as I am at this present Writing, This is to let you know, that Yesterday, between the Hours of Eleven and Twelve, I was hanged, drawn and quar∣tered. I died very penitently, and every Body thought my Case very hard. Remember me kindly to my poor Fatherless Children.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Yours till Death, <HI>W. B.</HI></SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>It so happened, that this honest Fellow was relieved by a Party of his Friends, and had the Satisfaction to see all the Rebels hanged who had been his Enemies. I must not omit a Circum∣stance which exposed him to Raillery his whole Life after. Before the Arrival of the next Post, that would have set all Things clear, his Wife was married to a Second Husband, who lived in the peaceable Possession of her; and the Cor∣poral, who was a Man of plain Understanding, did not care to stir in the Matter, as knowing that she had the News of his Death under his own Hand, which she might have produced upon Occasion.</P>

<P>IT has always been my Endeavour to distinguish between Realities and Appearances, and to se∣parate true Merit from the Pretence to it. As it shall ever be my Study to make Discoveries of this Nature in Humane Life, and to settle the proper Distinctions between the Virtues and Per∣fections of Mankind, and those false Colours and Resemblances of them that shine alike in the Eyes of the Vulgar; so I shall be more particu∣larly careful to search into the various Merits and Pretences of the learned World. This is the more necessary, because there seems to be a ge∣neral Combination among the Pedants to extol one another's Labours, and cry up one another's Parts; while Men of Sense, either through that Modesty which is natural to them, or the Scorn they have for such trifling Commendations, en∣joy their Stock of Knowledge like a hidden Trea∣sure, with Satisfaction and Silence. Pedantry in∣deed in Learning is like Hypocrisy in Religion, a Form of Knowledge without the Power of it, that attracts the Eyes of the Common People, breaks out in Noise and Show, and finds its Re∣ward not from any inward Pleasure that attends it, but from the Praises and Approbations which it receives from Men.</P>
<P>Of this shallow Species there is not a more im∣portunate, empty, and conceited Animal, than that which is generally known by the Name of a Critick. This, in the common Acceptation of the Word, is one that, without entering into
<PB N="253" REF="260"/>
the Sense and Soul of an Author, has a few ge∣neral Rules, which, like mechanical Instru∣ments, he applies to the Works of every Writer, and as they quadrate with them, pronounces the Author perfect or defective. He is Master of a certain Set of Words, as Unity, Style, Fire, Flegm, Easy, Natural, Turn, Sentiment, and the like; which he varies, compounds, divides, and throws together, in every Part of his Discourse, without any Thought or Meaning. The Marks you may know him by are, an elevated Eye, and dogmatical Brow, a positive Voice, and a Contempt for every Thing that comes out, whe∣ther he has read it or not. He dwells altogether in Generals. He praises or dispraises in the Lump. He shakes his Head very frequently at the Pedantry of Universities, and bursts into Laughter when you mention an Author that is not known at <HI>Will</HI>'s. He hath formed his Judg∣ment upon <HI>Homer, Horace,</HI> and <HI>Virgil,</HI> not from their own Works, but from those of <HI>Rapin</HI> and <HI>Bossu.</HI> He knows his own Strength so well, that he never dares praise any Thing in which he has not a <HI>French</HI> Author for his Voucher.</P>
<P>With these extraordinary Talents and Accom∣plishments, Sir <HI>Timothy Tittle</HI> puts Men in Vogue, or condemns them to Obscurity, and sits as Judge of Life and Death upon every Author that ap∣pears in Publick. It is impossible to represent the Pangs, Agonies, and Convulsions, which Sir <HI>Ti∣mothy</HI> expresses in every Feature of his Face, and Muscle of his Body, upon the reading of a bad Poet.</P>
<P>About a Week ago I was engaged at a Friend's of mine in an agreeable Conversation with his Wife and Daughters, when in the Height of our Mirth, Sir <HI>Timothy,</HI> who makes Love to my Friend's eldest Daughter, came in amongst us puffing and blowing as if he had been very much out of Breath. He immediately called for a
<PB N="254" REF="261"/>
Chair, and desired Leave to sit down, without any further Ceremony. I ask'd him, Where he had been? Whether he was out of Order? He only replied, That he was quite spent, and fell a cursing in Soliloquy. I could hear him cry, <HI>A Wicked Rogue—An execrable Wretch—Wat there ever such a Monster—</HI>The young Ladies upon this began to be affrighted, and asked, Whether any one had hurt him? He answered nothing, but still talked to himself. <HI>To lay the first Scene,</HI> says he, <HI>in St.</HI> James<HI>'s</HI> Park, <HI>and the last in</HI> Northamptonshire! Is that all, says I? Then I suppose you have been at the Rehearsal of a Play this Morning. <HI>Been!</HI> says he; I have been at <HI>Northampton,</HI> in the <HI>Park,</HI> in a Lady's Bed Chamber, in a Dining-Room, every where; the Rogue has led me such a Dance—Tho' I could scarce forbear laughing at his Discourse, I told him I was glad it was no worse, and that he was only Metaphorically weary. In short, Sir, says he, the Author has not observed a single Unity in his whole Play; the Scene shifts in every Dialogue; the Villain has hurried me up and down at such a Rate, that I am tired off my Legs. I could not but observe with some Plea∣sure, that the young Lady whom he made Love to, conceived a very just Aversion towards him, upon seeing him so very passionate in Trifles. And as she had that natural Sense which makes her a better Judge than a Thousand Criticks, she began to rally him upon this foolish Humour. For my Part, says she, I never knew a Play take that was written up to your Rules, as you call them. How Madam! says he, Is that your Opi∣nion? I am sure you have a better Tast. It is a pretty Kind of Magick, says she, the Poets have, to transport an Audience from Place to Place without the Help of a Coach and Horses. I could travel round the World at such a Rate. 'Tis such an Entertainment as an Enchantress finds
<PB N="255" REF="262"/>
when she fancies her self in a Wood, or upon a Mountain, at a Feast, or a Solemnity; though at the same Time she has never stirred out of her Cottage. Your Simile, Madam, says Sir <HI>Timo∣thy,</HI> is by no Means just. Pray, says she, let my Similies pass without a Criticism. I must confess, continued she, (for I found she was re∣solved to exasperate him) I laughed very heartily at the last new Comedy which you found so much Fault with. But Madam, says he, you ought not to have laughed; and I defy any one to show me a single Rule that you could laugh by. Ought not to laugh! says she: Pray who should hinder me. Madam, says he, there are such People in the World as <HI>Rapin, Dacier,</HI> and several others, that ought to have spoiled your Mirth. I have heard, says the young Lady, That your great Criticks are always very bad Poets: I fancy there is as much Difference be∣tween the Works of one and the other, as there is between the Carriage of a Dancing Master and a Gentleman. I must confess, continued she, I would not be troubled with so fine a Judg∣ment as yours is; for I find you feel more Vexa∣tion in a bad Comedy, than I do in a deep Tra∣gedy. Madam, says Sir <HI>Timothy,</HI> That is not my Fault, they should learn the Art of Writing. For my Part, says the young Lady, I should think the greatest Art in your Writers of Come∣dies is to please. To please! says Sir <HI>Timothy,</HI> and immediately fell a laughing. Truly, says she, that is my Opinion. Upon this, he com∣posed his Countenance, looked upon his Watch, and took his Leave.</P>
<P>I hear that Sir <HI>Timothy</HI> has not been at my Friend's House since this notable Conference, to the great Satisfaction of the young Lady, who by this Means has got rid of a very impertinent Fop.</P>
<P><PB N="250" REF="263"/>
I must confess, I could not but observe, with a great deal of Surprize, how this Gentleman, by his ill Nature, Folly, and Affectation, hath made himself capable of suffering so many ima∣ginary Pains, and looking with such a sense∣less Severity upon the common Diversions of Life.</P>

<P>THE World is so overgrown with Singula∣rities in Behaviour, and Method of Living, that I have no sooner laid before Mankind the Absurdity of one Species of Men, but there starts up to my View some new Sect of Impertinents that had before escaped Notice. This Afternoon, as I was talking with fine Mrs. <HI>Sprightly</HI>'s Por∣ter, and desiring Admittance upon an extraordi∣nary Occasion, it was my Fate to be spy'd by <HI>Tom Modely</HI> riding by in his Chariot. He did me the Honour to stop, and asked, What I did there of a <HI>Monday?</HI> I answered, That I had Business of Importance, which I wanted to communicate to the Lady of the House. <HI>Tom</HI> is one of those Fools who look upon Knowledge of the Fashion to be the only Liberal Science; and was so rough as to tell me, That a well-bred Man would as soon call upon a Lady (who keeps a Day) at Mid∣night, as on any Day but that on which she pro∣fesses being at Home. There are Rules and De∣corums which are never to be transgressed by
<PB N="257" REF="264"/>
those who understand the World; and he who offends in that Kind, ought not to take it ill if he is turned away, even when he sees the Person look out at her Window whom he enquires for. Nay, said he, my Lady <HI>Dimple</HI> is so positive in this Rule, that she takes it for a Piece of good Breeding and Distinction to deny her self with her own Mouth. Mrs. <HI>Comma,</HI> the great Scho∣lar, insists upon it; and I my self have heard her assert, That a Lord's Porter, or a Lady's Woman, cannot be said to lie in that Case, because they act by Instruction; and their Words are no more their own, than those of a Puppet.</P>
<P>He was going on with this Ribaldry, when on a sudden he looked on his Watch, and said, ho had Twenty Visits to make, and drove away without further Ceremony. I was then at Lei∣sure to reflect upon the Tastless Manner of Life, which a Set of idle Fellows lead in this Town, and spend Youth it self with less Spirit, than other Men do their old Age. These Expletives in Humane Society, tho' they are in themselves wholly insignificant, become of some Considera∣tion when they are mixed with others. I am very much at a Loss how to define, or under what Character, Distinction, or Denomination, to place them, except you give me Leave to call them the Order of the <HI>Insipids.</HI> This Order is in its Extent like that of the Jesuits, and you see of them in every Way of Life, and in every Profession. <HI>Tom Modely</HI> has long appeared to me at the Head of this Species. By being habi∣tually in the best Company, he knows perfectly well when a Coat is well cut, or a Periwig well mounted. As soon as you enter the Place where he is, he tells the next Man to him who is your Taylor, and judges of you more from the Choice of your Periwig-maker than of your Friend. His Business in this World was to be well dressed; and the greatest Circumstance that is to be recor∣ded
<PB N="258" REF="265"/>
in his Annals is, That he wears Twenty Shirts a Week. Thus, without ever speaking Reason among the Men, or Passion among the Women, he is every where well received; and without any one Man's Esteem, he has every Man's In∣dulgence.</P>
<P>This Order has produced great Numbers of tolerable Copiers in Painting, good Rhimers in Poetry, and harmless Projectors in Politicks. You may see them at first Sight grow acquainted by Sympathy, insomuch that one who had not stu∣died Nature, and did not know the true Cause of their sudden Familiarities, would think that they had some secret Intimation of each other, like the Free Masons. The other Day at <HI>Will</HI>'s, I heard <HI>Modely,</HI> and a Critick of the same Or∣der, show their equal Talents with great Delight. The Learned Insipid was commending <HI>Racine</HI>'s Turns; the Genteel Insipid, <HI>Devillier</HI>'s Curls.</P>
<P>These Creatures, when they are not forced into any particular Employment, for want of Idea's in their own Imaginations, are the constant Plague of all they meet with by Enquiries for News and Scandal, which makes them the He∣roes of Visiting Days, where they help the De∣sign of the Meeting, which is to pass away that odious Thing called Time, in Discourses too trivial to raise any Reflections which may put well-bred Persons to the Trouble of Think∣ing.</P>

<P>I was looking out of my Parlour-Window this Morning, and receiving the Honours which <HI>Mar∣gery,</HI> the Milk-maid to our Lane, was doing me, by dancing before my Door with the Plate of half her Customers on her Head, when Mr. <HI>Clay∣ton,</HI> the Author of <HI>Arsinoe,</HI> made me a Visit, and desired me to insert the following Advertisement in my ensuing Paper.</P>
<Q><PB N="259" REF="266"/>
<P>The Pastoral Masque compos'd by Mr. <HI>Clayton,</HI> Author of <HI>Arsinoe,</HI> will be performed on <HI>Wednes∣day</HI> the 3d Instant, in the great Room at <HI>York-Buildings.</HI> Tickets are to be had at <HI>White</HI>'s Cho∣colate-house, <HI>St. James</HI>'s Coffee-house in <HI>St. James</HI>'s∣<HI>street,</HI> and <HI>Young Man</HI>'s Coffee-house.</P><P><HI>Note,</HI> The Tickets delivered out for the 27th of <HI>April,</HI> will be taken then.</P></Q>
<P>When I granted his Request, I made one to him, which was, That the Performers should put their Instruments in Tune before the Audience came in; for that I thought the Resentment of the Eastern Prince, who, according to the old Story, took <HI>Tuning</HI> for <HI>Playing,</HI> to be very just and natural. He was so civil, as not only to pro∣mise that Favour, but also to assure me, that he would order the Heels of the Performers to be muffled in Cotton, that the Artists in so polite an Age as ours, may not intermix with their Harmony a Custom which so nearly resembles the Stamping Dances of the <HI>West-Indians</HI> or <HI>Hot∣tentots.</HI></P>

read. As the rude and untaught Multitude are no Way wrought upon more effectually than by seeing publick Punishments and Executions; so Men of Letters and Education feel their Huma∣nity most forcibly exercised, when they attend the Obsequies of Men who had arrived at any Perfection in Liberal Accomplishments. Thea∣trical Action is to be esteemed as such, except it be objected, that we cannot call that an Art which cannot be attained by Art. Voice, Sta∣ture, Motion, and other Gifts, must be very bountifully bestowed by Nature, or Labour and Industry will but push the unhappy Endeavourer, in that Way, the further off his Wishes.</P>
<P>Such an Actor as Mr. <HI>Betterton</HI> ought to be re∣corded with the same Respect as <HI>Roscius</HI> among the <HI>Romans.</HI> The greatest Orator has thought fit to quote his Judgment, and celebrate his Life. <HI>Roscius</HI> was the Example to all that would form themselves into proper and winning Behaviour. His Action was so well adapted to the Sentiments he expressed, that the Youth of <HI>Rome</HI> thought they wanted only to be virtuous to be as graceful in their Appearance as <HI>Roscius.</HI> The Imagination took a lovely Impression of what was great and good; and they who never thought of setting up for the Arts of Imitation, became themselves imitable Characters.</P>
<P>There is no Humane Inventions so aptly cal∣culated for the forming a Free-born People as that of a Theatre. <HI>Tully</HI> reports, That the ce∣lebrated Player of whom I am speaking used fre∣quently to say, <HI>The Perfection of an Actor is only to become what he is doing.</HI> Young Men, who are too unattentive to receive Lectures, are irre∣sistibly taken with Performances. Hence it is, that I extremely lament the little Relish the Gentry of this Nation have at present for the just and noble Representations in some of our Tragedies. The Opera's, which are of late in∣troduced,
<PB N="262" REF="269"/>
can leave no Trace behind them that can be of Service beyond the present Moment. To sing and to dance, are Accomplishments very few have any Thoughts of practising; but to speak justly, and move gracefully, is what every Man thinks he does perform, or wishes he did.</P>
<P>I have hardly a Notion, that any Performer of Antiquity could surpass the Action of Mr. <HI>Better∣ton</HI> in any of the Occasions in which he has appear'd on our Stage. The wonderful Agony which he ap∣peared in, when he examined the Circumstance of the Handkerchief in <HI>Othello;</HI> the Mixture of Love that intruded upon his Mind upon the in∣nocent Answers <HI>Desdemona</HI> makes, betrayed in his Gesture such a Variety and Vicissitude of Pas∣sions, as would admonish a Man to be afraid of his own Heart, and perfectly convince him, that it is to stab it, to admit that worst of Daggers, Jea∣lousy. Whoever reads in his Closet this admira∣ble Scene, will find that he cannot, except he has as warm an Imagination as <HI>Shakespear</HI> him∣self, find any but dry, incoherent, and broken Sentences: But a Reader that has seen <HI>Bettterton</HI> act it, observes there could not be a Word added; that longer Speech had been unnatu∣ral, nay impossible, in <HI>Othello</HI>'s Circumstances. The charming Passage in the same Tragedy, where he tells the Manner of winning the Af∣fection of his Mistress, was urged with so moving and graceful an Energy, that while I walked in the Cloysters, I thought of him with the same Concern as if I waited for the Remains of a Person who had in real Life done all that I had seen him represent. The Gloom of the Place and faint Lights before the Ceremony aypeared contributed to the melancholy Disposition I wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in; and I began to be extremely afflicted, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Brutus</HI> and <HI>Cassius</HI> had any Difference; that <HI>Hot¦spur</HI>'s Gallantry was so unfortunate; and that th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Mirth and good Humour of <HI>Falstaff,</HI> could no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

exempt him from the Grave. Nay, this Occa∣sion in me, who look upon the Distinctions a∣mongst Men to be meerly Scenical, raised Re∣flections upon the Emptiness of all Humane Per∣fection and Greatness in general; and I could not but regret, that the Sacred Heads which lie bu∣ried in the Neighbourhood of this little Portion of Earth in which my poor old Friend is de∣posited, are returned to Dust as well as he, and that there is no Difference in the Grave between the Imaginary and the Real Monarch. This made me say of Humane Life it self with <HI>Mack∣beth:</HI></P>
<Q><L>To Morrow, to Morrow, and to Morrow,</L>
<L>Creeps in a stealing Pace from Day to Day,</L>
<L>To the last Moment of recorded Time!</L>
<L>And all our Yesterdays have lighted Fools</L>
<L>To their eternal Night! Out, out short Candle!</L>
<L>Life's but a walking Shadow, a poor Player</L>
<L>That struts and frets his Hour upon the Stage,</L>
<L>And then is heard no more.</L></Q>
<P>The Mention I have here made of Mr. <HI>Better∣ton,</HI> for whom I had, as long as I have known any Thing, a very great Esteem and Gratitude for the Pleasure he gave me, can do him no Good; but it may possibly be of Service to the unhappy Woman he has left behind him, to have it known, that this great Tragedian was never in a Scene half so moving, as the Circumstances of his Af∣fairs created at his Departure. His Wife, after the Cohabitation of Forty Years in the strictest Amity, has long pined away with a Sense of his Decay, as well in his Person as his little Fortune; and in Proportion to that, she has herself de∣cayed both in her Health and Reason. Her Husband's Death, added to her Age and Infirmi∣ties, would certainly have determined her Life, but that the Greatness of her Distress has been her Relief, by a present Depravation of her
<PB N="264" REF="271"/>
Senses. This Absence of Reason is her best De∣fence against Age, Sorrow, Poverty, and Sick∣ness. I dwell upon this Account so distinctly, in Obedience to a certain great Spirit, who hides her Name, and has by Letter applied to me to re∣commend to her some Object of Compassion, from whom she may be concealed.</P>
<P>This, I think, is a proper Occasion for exerting such heroick Generosity; and as there is an inge∣nuous Shame in those who have known better Fortune to be reduced to receive Obligations, as well as a becoming Pain in the truly Generous to receive Thanks in this Case, both those Deli∣cacies are preserved; for the Person obliged is as incapable of knowing her Benefactress, as her Benefactress is unwilling to be known by her.</P>

<P>NEver was Man so much teazed, or suffered half the Uneasiness, as I have done this Evening, between a Couple of Fellows with whom I was unfortunately engaged to sup, where there were also several others in Company. One of them is the most invincibly impudent, and the other as incorrigibly absurd. Upon hearing my Name, the Man of Audacity, as he calls himself, began to assume an aukward Way of Reserve, by Way of Ridicule upon me as a Censor, and said, He must have a Care of his Behaviour, for there would Notes be writ upon all that should pass. The Man of Freedom and Ease (for such the other thinks himself) asked me, Whether my Sister <HI>Jenny</HI> was breeding or not? After they had done with me, they were impertinent to a very smart, but well-bred Man, who stood his Ground very well, and let the Company see they ought, but could not be out of Countenance. I look upon such a Defence as a real good Action; for while he received their Fire, there was a mo∣dest and worthy young Gentleman sat secure by him, and a Lady of the Family at the same Time, guarded against the nauseous Familiarity <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f the one, and the more painful Mirth of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ther. This Conversation, where there were Thousand Things said not worth repeating, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ade me consider with my self, How 'tis that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>en of these disagreeable Characters often go <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>eat Lengths in the World, and seldom fail of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>tstripping Men of Merit; nay, succeed so
<PB N="266" REF="273"/>
well, that with a Load of Imperfections on their Heads, they go on in Opposition to general Dis∣esteem, while they who are every Way their Superiors, languish away their Days, tho' posses∣sed of the Approbation and Good-will of all who know them.</P>
<P>If we would examine into the Secret Springs of Action in the Impudent and the Absurd, we shall find, tho' they bear a great Resemblance in their Behaviour, that they move upon very diffe∣rent Principles. The Impudent are pressing, tho' they know they are disagreeable; the Absurd are importunate, because they think they are ac∣ceptable, Impudence is a Vice, and Absurdity a Folly. Sir <HI>Francis Bacon</HI> talks very agreeably upon the Subject of Impudence. He takes No∣tice, That the Orator being asked, What was the First, Second, and Third Requisite, to make a fine Speaker? Still answered, <HI>Action.</HI> This, said he, is the very outward Form of Speaking, and yet it is what with the Generality has more Force than the most consummate Abilities. Im∣pudence is to the rest to Mankind of the same Use which Action is to Orators.</P>
<P>The Truth is, the Gross of Men are governed more by Appearances than Realities, and the Im∣pudent Man in his Air and Behaviour undertakes for himself that he has Ability and Merit, while the Modest or Diffident gives himself up as one who is possessed of neither. For this Reason, Men of Front carry Things before 'em with little Opposition, and make so skilful an Use of their Talent, that they can grow out of Humour like Men of Consequence, and be sowr, and make their Dissatisfaction do them the same Service as Desert. This Way of Thinking has often furni∣shed me with an Apology for great Men who confer Favours on the Impudent. In carrying on the Government of Mankind, they are not to consider what Men they themselves approve in
<PB N="267" REF="274"/>
their Closets and private Conversations, but what Men will extend themselves furthest, and more generally pass upon the World for such as their Patrons want in such and such Statious, and con∣sequently take so much Work off the Hands of those who employ them.</P>
<P>Far be it that I should attempt to lessen the Acceptance which Men of this Character meet with in the World; but I humbly propose only, that they who have Merit of a different Kind, would accomplish themselves in some Degree with this Quality of which I am now treating. Nay, I allow these Gentlemen to press as for∣ward as they please in the Advancement of their Interests and Fortunes, but not to intrude upon others in Conversation also: Let them do what they can with the Rich and the Great, as far as they are suffered, but let them not interrupt the Easy and Agreeable. They may be useful as Ser∣vants in Ambition, but never as Associates in Pleasure. However, as I would still drive at something instructive in every Lucubration, I must recommend it to all Men who feel in them∣selves an Impulse towards attempting laudable Actions, to acquire such a Degree of Assurance, as never to lose the Possession of themselves in publick or private, so far as to be incapable of acting with a due Decorum on any Occasion they are call'd to. It is a mean Want of Fortitude in a good Man, not to be able to do a virtuous Action with as much Confidence as an impudent Fel∣low does an ill One. There is no Way of mend∣ing such false Modesty, but by laying it down for a Rule, That there is nothing shameful but what is criminal.</P>
<P>The Jesuits, an Order whose Institution is per∣fectly calculated for making a Progress in the World, take Care to accomplish their Disciples for it, by breaking them of all impertinent Bash∣fulness, and accustoming them to a ready Per∣formance
<PB N="268" REF="275"/>
of all indifferent Things. I remember in my Travels, when I was once at a publick Exer∣cise in one of their Schools, a young Man made a most admirable Speech, with all the Beauty of Action, Cadence of Voice, and Force of Argument imaginable, in Defence of the Love of Glory. We were all enamoured with the Grace of the Youth, as he came down from the Desk, where he spoke, to present a Copy of his Speech to the Head of the Society. The Principal received it in a very obliging Manner, and bid him go to the Market-Place and fetch a Joint of Meat, for he should dine with him. He bowed, and in a Trice the Orator returned, full of the Sense of Glory in this Obedience, and with the best Shoulder of Mutton in the Market.</P>
<P>This Treatment capacitates them for every Scene of Life. I therefore recommend it to the Consideration of all who have the Instruction of Youth, Which of the Two is the more inexcu∣sable, he who does every Thing by the meer Force of his Impudence, or who performs no∣thing through the Oppression of his Modesty? In a Word, it is a Weakness not to be able to at∣tempt what a Man thinks he ought, and there is no Modesty but in Self-Denial.</P>

<P>THE Summer Season now approaching, se∣veral of our Family have invited me to pass away a Month or Two in the Country, and in∣deed nothing could be more agreeable to me than such a Recess, did I not consider that I am by Two Quarts a worse Companion than when I was last among my Relations: And I am admo∣nished by some of our Club, who have lately vi∣sited <HI>Staffordshire,</HI> that they drink at a greater Rate than they did at that Time. As every Soil does not produce every Fruit or Tree, so every Vice is not the Growth of every Kind of Life; and I have, ever since I could think, been asto∣nished, that Drinking should be the Vice of the Country. If it were possible to add to all our Senses, as we do to that of Sight, by Perspe∣ctives, we should methinks more particularly labour to improve them in the midst of the Va∣riety of beauteous Objects which Nature has pro∣duced to entertain us in the Country; and do we in that Place destroy the Use of what Organs we have? As for my Part, I cannot but lament the Destruction that has been made of the Wild Beasts of the Field, when I see large Tracts of Earth possessed by Men who take no Advantage
<PB N="271" REF="278"/>
of their being rational, but lead meer Animal Lives, making it their whole Endeavour to kill in themselves all they have above Beasts; to wit, the Use of Reason, and Tast of Society. It is frequently boasted in the Writings of Orators and Poets, That it is to Eloquence and Poesy we owe that we are drawn out of Woods and Solitudes into Towns and Cities, and from a wild and savage Being become acquainted with the Laws of Humanity and Civility. If we are obliged to these Arts for so great Service, I could wish they were employed to give us a Second Turn; that as they have brought us to dwell in Society, (a Blessing which no other Creatures know) so they would perswade us, now they have settled us, to lay out all our Thoughts in surpassing each other in those Faculties in which only we excel other Creatures. But it is at pre∣sent so far otherwise, that the Contention seems to be, who shall be most eminent in Performan∣ces wherein Beasts enjoy greater Abilities than we have. I'll undertake, were the Butler and Swineherd, at any true Esquire's in <HI>Great Britain,</HI> to keep and compare Accounts of what Wash is drank up in so many Hours in the Parlour and the Pigsty, it would appear, the Gentleman of the House gives much more to his Friends than his Hogs.</P>
<P>This, with many other Evils, arises from the Error in Men's Judgments, and not making true Distinctions between Persons and Things. It is usually thought, That a few Sheets of Parch∣ment, made before a Male and Female of weal∣thy Houses come together, give the Heirs and Descendants of that Marriage Possession of Lands and Tenements; but the Truth is, there is no Man who can be said to be Proprietor of an Estate, but he who knows how to enjoy it. Nay, it shall never be allowed, that the Land is not a Waste, when the Master is uncultivated. There∣fore,
<PB N="272" REF="279"/>
to avoid Confusion, it is to be noted, that a Peasant with a great Estate is but an Incum∣bent, and that he must be a Gentleman to be a Landlord. A Landlord enjoys what he has with his Heart, an Incumbent with his Stomach. Gluttony, Drunkenness, and Riot, are the Enter∣tainments of an Incumbent; Benevolence, Ci∣vility, Social and Humane Virtues, the Accom∣plishments of a Landlord. Who, that has any Passion for his native Country, does not think it worse than conquered, when so large Diversions of it are in the Hands of Salvages, that know no Use of Property but to be Tyrants; or Liber∣ty, but to be unmannerly? A Gentleman in a Country Life enjoys Paradise with a Temper fit for it; a Clown is cursed in it with all the cut∣ting and unruly Passions Man could be torment∣ed with when he was expelled from it.</P>
<P>There is no Character more deservedly esteem∣ed than that of a Country Gentleman, who un∣derstands the Station in which Heaven and Na∣ture have plac'd him. He is Father to his Te∣nants, and Patron to his Neighbours, and is more superior to those of lower Fortune by his Bene∣volence than his Possessions. He justly divides his Time between Solitude and Company, so as to use the one for the other. His Life is spent in the good Offices of an Advocate, a Referee, a Companion, a Mediator, and a Friend. His Counsel and Knowledge are a Guard to the Sim∣plicity and Innocence of those of lower Talents, and the Entertainment and Happiness of those of equal. When a Man in a Country Life has this Turn, as it is to be hoped Thousands have, he lives in a more happy Condition than any is described in the Pastoral Descriptions of Poets, or the vain-glorious Solitudes recorded by Philo∣sophers.</P>
<P>To a Thinking Man it would seem prodigious, that the very Situation in a Country Life does
<PB N="273" REF="280"/>
not incline Men to a Scorn of the mean Gratifi∣cations some take in it. To stand by a Stream, naturally lulls the Mind into Composure and Re∣verence; to walk in Shades, diversifies that Plea∣sure; and a bright Sunshine makes a Man con∣sider all Nature in Gladness, and himself the happiest Being in it, as he is the most conscious of her Gifts and Enjoyments. It would be the most impertinent Piece of Pedantry imaginable to form our Pleasures by Imitation of others. I will not therefore mention <HI>Scipio</HI> and <HI>Laelius,</HI> who are generally produced on this Subject as Authorities for the Charms of a Rural Life. He that does not feel the Force of agreeable Views and Situations in his own Mind, will hardly ar∣rive at the Satisfactions they bring from the Re∣flexions of others. However, they who have a Tast that Way, are more particularly inflamed with Desire when they see others in the Enjoy∣ment of it, especially when Men carry into the Country a Knowledge of the World as well as of Nature. The Leisure of such Persons is en∣dear'd and refin'd by Reflexion upon Cares and Inquietudes. The Absence of past Labours dou∣bles present Pleasures, which is still augmented, if the Person in Solitude has the Happiness of be∣ing addicted to Letters. My Cousin <HI>Frank Bicker∣staff</HI> gives me a very good Notion of this sort of Felicity in the following Letter.</P>
<LETTER>

selves to each other by the Difference of our For∣tunes. He esteems me for being so well pleased with a little, and I admire him for enjoying so handsomely a great deal. He has not the little Tast of observing the Colour of a Tulip, or the Edging of a Leaf of Box, but rejoices in open Views, the Regularity of this Plantation, and the Wildness of another as well as the Fall of a River, the Rising of a Promontory, and all other Objects fit to entertain a Mind like his, that has been long versed in great and pu∣blick Amusements. The Make of the Soul is as much seen in Leisure as in Business. He has long lived in Courts, and been admired in As∣semblies, so that he has added to Experience a most charming Eloquence; by which he com∣municates to me the Idea's of my own Mind upon the Objects we meet with, so agreeably, that with his Company in the Fields, I at once enjoy the Country, and a Landskip of it. He is now altering the Course of Canals and Ri∣vulets, in which he has an Eye to his Neigh∣bour's Satisfaction, as well as his own. He often makes me Presents by turning the Water into my Grounds, and sends me Fish by their own Streams. To avoid my Thanks, he makes Nature the Instrument of his Bounty, and does all good Offices so much with the Air of a Com∣panion, that his Frankness hides his own Con∣descension, as well as my Gratitude. Leave the World to it self, and come see us.</P>

<P>HAving this Morning spent some Time in read∣ing on the Subject of the Vicissitude of hu∣mane Life, I laid aside my Book, and began to ruminate on the Discourse which raised in me those Reflections. I believed it a very good Of∣fice to the World, to sit down and show others the Road in which I am experienced by my Wan∣drings and Errors. This is <HI>Seneca</HI>'s Way of Thinking, and he had half convinced me, how dangerous it is to our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ue Happiness and Tran∣quility to fix our Minds upon any Thing which is in the Power of Fortune. It is excusable only in Animals who have not the Use of Reason, to be catched by Hooks and Baits. Wealth, Glory, and Power, which the ordinary People look up at with Admiration, the Learned and Wise know to be only so many Snares laid to enslave them. There is nothing further to be sought for with Earnestness, than what will cloath and feed us. If we pamper our selves in our Diet, or give our Imaginations a Loose in our Desires, the Body will no longer obey the Mind. Let us think no further than to defend our selves against Hunger, Thirst, and Cold. We are to remember, that every Thing else is despicable, and not worth our Care. To want little is true Grandeur, and very
<PB N="276" REF="283"/>
few Things are great to a great Mind. Those who form their Thoughts in this Manner, and ab∣stract themselves from the World, are out of the Way of Fortune, and can look with Contempt both on her Favours and her Frowns. At the same Time, they who separate themselves from the im∣mediate Commerce with the busy Part of Man∣kind, are still beneficial to them, while by their Studies and Writings they recommend to them the small Value which ought to be put upon what they pursue with so much Labour and Disquiet. Whilst such Men are thought the most idle, they are the most usefully employed. They have all Things, both Humane and Divine, under Consi∣deration. To be perfectly free from the Insults of Fortune, we should arm our selves with their Reflections. We should learn, That none but in∣tellectual Possessions are what we can properly call our own. All Things from without are but bor∣rowed. What Fortune gives us, is not ours; and whatever she gives, she can take away.</P>
<P>It is a common Imputation to <HI>Seneca,</HI> that tho' he declaimed with so much Strength of Reason, and a Stoical Contempt of Riches and Power, he was at the same Time one of the richest and most powerful Men in <HI>Rome.</HI> I know no Instance of his being insolent in that Fortune, and can there∣fore read his Thoughts on those Subjects with the more Deference. I will not give Philosophy so poor a Look, as to say it cannot live in Courts; but I am of Opinion, that it is there in the great∣est Eminence, when amidst the Affluence of All the World can bestow, and the Add esses of a Crowd who follow him for that Reason, a Man can think both of himself and those about him abstracted from these Circumstances. Such a Phi∣losopher is as much above an Anchorite, as a wise Matron, who passes through the World with Inno∣cence, is preferable to the Nun who locks her self up from it.</P>
<P><PB N="277" REF="284"/>
Full of these Thoughts I left my Lodgings, and took a Walk to the Court End of the Town; and the Hurry and Busy Faces I met with about <HI>White∣hall,</HI> made me form to my self Ideas of the dif∣ferent Prospects of all I saw, from the Turn and Cast of their Countenances. All, methought, had the same Thing in View, but prosecuted their Hopes with a different Air: Some showed an un∣becoming Eagerness, some a surly Impatience, some a winning Deference, but the Generality a servile Complaisance.</P>
<P>I could not but observe, as I roved about the Offices, That all who were still but in Expecta∣tion, murmured at Fortune; and all who had ob∣tained their Wishes, immediately began to say, there was no such Being. Each believed it an Act of blind Chance that any other Man was prefer∣red, but owed only to Service and Merit what he had obtained himself. It is the Fault of studious Men to appear in publick with too contemplative a Carriage; and I began to observe, that my Fi∣gure, Age, and Dress, made me particular: For which Reason I thought it better to remove a stu∣dious Countenance from among busy ones, and take a Turn with a Friend in the <HI>Privy-Garden.</HI></P>
<P>When my Friend was alone with me there, <HI>Isaac,</HI> said he, I know you came Abroad only to Moralize and make Observations, and I will car∣ry you hard by, where you shall see all that you have your self considered or read in Authors, or collected from Experience, concerning blind For∣tune and irresistible Destiny, illustrated in real Persons and proper Mechanisms. The Graces, the Muses, the Fates, all the Beings which have a good or ill Influence upon Humane Life, are, you'l say, very justly figured in the Persons of Women; and where I am carrying you, you'l see enough of that Sex together, in an Employment which will have so important an Effect upon those who are to receive their Manufacture, as will
<PB N="278" REF="285"/>
make them be respectively called Deities or Fu∣ries, as their Labour shall prove disadvantagious or successful to their Votaries. Without waiting for my Answer, he carried me to an Apartment contiguous to the <HI>Banqueting-House,</HI> where there were placed at Two long Tables a large Company of young Women, in decent and agreeable Ha∣bits, making up Tickets for the Lottery appoint∣ed by the Government. There walk'd between the Tables a Person who presided over the Work. This Gentlewoman seemed an Emblem of For∣tune, she commanded as if unconcerned in their Business; and though every Thing was performed by her Direction, she did not visibly interpose in Particulars. She seemed in Pain at our near Ap∣proach to her, and most to approve us, when we made her no Advances. Her Height, her Mein, her Gesture, her Shape, and her Countenance, had something that spoke both Familiarity and Dignity. She therefore appeared to me not only a Picture of Fortune, but of Fortune as I liked her; which made me break out in the following Words:</P>

<P>IT has happened to be for some Days the De∣liberation at the Learned'st Board in this House, whence Honour and Title had its first Original. <HI>Timoleon,</HI> who is very particular in his Opinions, but is thought particular for no other Cause but that he acts against depraved Custom, by the Rules of Nature and Reason, in a very handsome Discourse gave the Company to under∣stand,
<PB N="280" REF="287"/>
That in those Ages which first degenera∣ted from Simplicity of Life, and Natural Justice, the Wise among them thought it necessary to in∣spire Men with the Love of Virtue, by giving them who adhered to the Interests of Innocence and Truth, some distinguishing Name to raise them above the common Level of Mankind. This Way of fixing Appellations of Credit upon emi∣nent Merit, was what gave Being to Titles and Terms of Honour. Such a Name, continued he, without the Qualities which should give a Man Pretence to be exalted above others, does but turn him to Jest and Ridicule. Should one see another cudgelled, or scurvily treated, Do you think a Man so used would take it kindly to be called <HI>Hector,</HI> or <HI>Alexander?</HI> Every Thing must bear a Proportion with the outward Value that is set upon it; or instead of being long had in Venera∣tion, that very Term of Esteem will become a Word of Reproach. When <HI>Timoleon</HI> had done speaking, <HI>Urbanus</HI> pursued the same Purpose, by giving an Account of the Manner in which the <HI>Indian</HI> Kings, who were lately in <HI>Great Britain,</HI> did Honour to the Person where they lodged. They were placed, said he, in an handsome Apart∣ment, at an Upholsterer's in <HI>King-street, Covent-Garden.</HI> The Man of the House, it seems, had been very observant of them, and ready in their Service. These just and generous Princes, who act according to the Dictates of natural Justice, thought it proper to confer some Dignity upon their Landlord before they left his House. One of them had been sick during his Residence there, and having never before been in a Bed, had a very great Veneration for him who made that Engine of Repose, so useful and so necessary in his Dist ress. It was consulted among the Four Princes' by what Name to dignify his great Me∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> and Services.

Posture recounted the Civilities they had recei∣ved, and particularly repeated the Care which was taken of their Sick Brother. This, in their Imagination, who are used to know the Injuries of Weather, and the Vicissitudes of Cold and Heat, gave them very great Impressions of a skil∣ful Upholsterer, whose Furniture was so well con∣trived for their Protection on such Occasions. It is with these less instructed (I will not say less knowing) People, the Manner of doing Honour, to impose some Name significant of the Qualities of the Person they distinguish, and the good Of∣fices received from him. It was therefore resol∣ved, to call their Landlord <HI>Cadaroque,</HI> which is the Name of the strongest Fort in their Part of the World. When they had agreed upon the Name, they sent for their Landlord, and as he entered into their Presence, the Emperor of the <HI>Mohocks</HI> taking him by the Hand, called him <HI>Ca∣daroque.</HI> After which the other Three Princes re∣peated the same Word and Ceremony.</P>
<P><HI>Timoleon</HI> appeared much satisfied with this Ac∣count, and having a Philosophick Turn, began to argue against the Modes and Manners of those Nations which we esteem polite, and express himself with Disdain at our unusual Method of cal∣ling such as are Strangers to our Innovations, bar∣barous. I have, says he, so great a Deference for the Distinction given by these Princes, that <HI>Cada∣roque</HI> shall be my Upholsterer.—He was go∣ing on, but the intended Discourse was interrup∣ted by <HI>Minucio</HI> who sat near him, a small Philo∣sopher, who is also somewhat of a Politician; one of those who sets up for Knowledge by Doubt∣ing, and has no other Way of making himself considerable, but by contradicting all he hears said. He has, besides much Doubt and Spirit of Contradiction, a constant Suspicion as to State-Affairs. This accomplish'd Gentleman, with a very awful Brow, and a Countenance full of
<PB N="282" REF="289"/>
Weight, told <HI>Timoleon,</HI> That it was a great Mis∣fortune Men of Letters seldom looked into the Bottom of Things. Will any Man, continued he, perswade me, that this was not from the Begin∣ning to the End a concerted Affair? Who can convince the World, that Four Kings shall come over here, and lie at the Two Crowns and Cushi∣on, and one of them fall sick, and the Place be called <HI>King-street,</HI> and all this by meer Accident? No, no: To a Man of very small Penetration, it appears, that <HI>Tee Yee Neen He Ga Row,</HI> Emperor of the <HI>Mohocks,</HI> was prepared for this Adventure beforehand. I do not care to contradict any Gentleman in his Discourse; but I must say, how∣ever, <HI>Sa Ga Yeath Rua Geth Ton,</HI> and <HI>E Tow Oh Koam,</HI> might be surprised in this Matter; never∣theless, <HI>He Nec Yeth Taw No Row</HI> knew it before he set Foot on the <HI>English</HI> Shore.</P>
<P><HI>Timoleon</HI> looked stedfastly at him for some Time, then shaked his Head, paid for his Tea, and marched off. Several others who sat round him, were in their Turns attacked by this ready Disputant. A Gentleman who was at some Di∣stance, happened in Discourse to say it was Four Miles to <HI>Hammersmith.</HI> I must beg your Pardon, says <HI>Minucio,</HI> when we say a Place is so far off, we do not mean exactly from the very Spot of Earth we are in, but from the Town where we are; so that you must begin your Account from the End of <HI>Piccadilly;</HI> and if you do so, I'll lay any Man Ten to One, it is not above Three good Miles off. Another, about <HI>Minucio</HI>'s Level of Understanding, began to take him up in this im∣portant Argument, and maintained, That consi∣dering the Way from <HI>Pimlico</HI> at the End of <HI>St. James</HI>'s <HI>Park,</HI> and the Crossing from <HI>Chelsea</HI> by <HI>Earl</HI>'s-<HI>Court,</HI> he would stand to it, that it was full Four Miles. But <HI>Minucio</HI> replied with great Vehemence, and seemed so much to have the bet∣ter of the Dispute, that this Adversary quitted the
<PB N="283" REF="290"/>
Field, as well as the other. I sat till I saw the Table almost all vanished, where, for Want of Discourse, <HI>Minucio</HI> asked me, How I did? To which I answered, Very well. That's very much, said he; I assure you, you look paler than ordinary. Nay, thought I, if he won't allow me to know whether I am well or not, there's no staying for me neither. Upon which I took my Leave, pon∣dering as I went Home at this strange Poverty of Imagination, which makes Men run into the Fault of giving Contradiction. They want in their Minds Entertainment for themselves or their Company, and therefore build all they speak up∣on what is started by others; and since they can∣not improve that Foundation, they strive to de∣stroy it. The only Way of dealing with these People is, to answer in Monosyllables, or by Way of Question. When one of them tells you a Thing that he thinks extraordinary, I go no fur∣ther than, Say you so, Sir? Indeed! Heyday! Or, Is it come to that! These little Rules, which appear but silly in the Repetition, have brought me with great Tranquility to this Age. And I have made it an Observation, that as Assent is more agreeable than Flattery, so Contradiction is more odious than Calumny.</P>

<P>WHEN a Man is in a serious Mood, and ponders upon his own Make, with a Re∣trospect to the Actions of his Life, and the many fatal Miscarriages in it, which he owes to ungo∣verned Passions, he is then apt to say to himself, That Experience has guarded him against such Errors for the future: But Nature often recurs in Spite of his best Resolutions, and it is to the very End of our Days a Struggle between our Reason and our Temper, which shall have the Empire over us. Hewever, this is very much to be help∣ed by Circumspection, and a constant Alarm against the first Onsets of Passion. As this is in general a necessary Care to make a Man's Life easy and agreeable to himself, so it is more parti∣cularly the Duty of such as are engaged in Friend∣ship and more near Commerce with others. Those who have their Joys, have also their Griefs in Proportion, and none can extremely exalt or depress Friends, but Friends. The harsh Things which come from the rest of the World, are re∣ceived and repulsed with that Spirit which every honest Man bears for his own Vindication; but Unkindness in Words or Actions among Friends, affect us at the first Instant in the inmost Reces∣ses of our Souls. Indifferent People, if I may so say, can wound us only in heterogeneous Parts, maim us in our Legs or Arms; but the Friend can
<PB N="285" REF="292"/>
make no Pass but at the Heart it self. On the other Side, the most impotent Assistance, the meer well Wishes of a Friend, gives a Man Con∣stancy and Courage against the most prevailing Force of his Enemies. It is here only a Man en∣joys and suffers to the Quick. For this Reason, the most gentle Behaviour is absolutely necessary to maintain Friendship in any Degree above the com∣mon Level of Acquaintance. But there is a Re∣lation of Life much more near than the most strict and sacred Friendship, that is to say, Marriage. This Union is of too close and delicate a Nature to be easily conceived by those who do not know that Condition by Experience. Here a Man should, if possible, soften his Passions; if not for his own Ease, in Compliance to a Creature formed with a Mind of a quite different Make from his own. I am sure, I do not mean it an Injury to Women, when I say there is a Sort of Sex in Souls. I am tender of offending them, and know it is hard not to do it on this Subject; but I must go on to say, That the Soul of a Man and that of a Woman, are made very unlike, according to the Employments for which they are designed. The Ladies will please to observe, I say, our Minds have different, not superior Qualities to theirs. The Virtues have respectively a Masculine and a Feminine Cast. What we call in Men Wisdom, is in Women Pru∣dence. It is a Partiality to call one greater than the other. A prudent Woman is in the same Class of Honour as a wise Man, and the Scandals in the Way of both are equally dangerous. But to make this State any Thing but a Burthen, and not hang a Weight upon our very Beings, it is very proper each of the Couple should frequent∣ly remember, that there are many Things which grow out of their very Natures that are pardonable, nay becoming, when considered as such, but without that Reflection must give the quickest Pain and Vexation. To manage well a
<PB N="286" REF="293"/>
great Family, is as worthy an Instance of Capacity, as to execute a great Employment; and for the Generality, as Women perform the considerable Part of their Duties, as well as Men do theirs; so in their common Behaviour, those of ordinary Genius are not more trivial than the common Rate of Men; and in my Opinion, the playing of a Fan is every whit as good an Entertainment as the beating a Snuff-Box.</P>
<P>But however I have rambled in this Libertine Manner of Writing by way of Essay, I now sat down with an Intention to represent to my Rea∣ders, how pernicious, how sudden, and how fatal Surprizes of Passion are to the Mind of Man; and that in the more intimate Commerces of Life they are most liable to arise, even in our most sedate and indolent Hours. Occurrences of this Kind have had very terrible Effects; and when one reflects upon 'em, we cannot but tremble to consider what we are capable of being wrought up to against all the Ties of Nature, Love, Honour, Reason, and Religion, tho' the Man who breaks thro' them all, had, an Hour before he did so, a lively and virtu∣ous Sense of their Dictates. When unhappy Ca∣tastrophe's make up Part of the History of Princes, and Persons who act in high Spheres, or are re∣presented in the moving Language, and well wrought Scenes of Tragedians, they do not fail of striking us with Terror; but then they affect us only in a transient Manner, and pass thro' our Ima∣ginations, as Incidents in which our Fortunes are too humble to be concerned, or which Writers form for the Ostentation of their own Force; or, at most, as Things fit rather to exercise the Pow∣ers of our Minds, than to create new Habits in them. Instead of such high Passages, I was think∣ing it would be of great Use (if any Body could hit it) to lay before the World such Adventures as befall Persons not exalted above the common Level. This, methought, would better prevail
<PB N="287" REF="294"/>
upon the ordinary Race of Men, who are so pre∣possessed with outward Appearances, that they mi∣stake Fortune for Nature, and believe nothing can relate to them that does not happen to such as live and look like themselves.</P>
<P>The unhappy End of a Gentleman whose Story an Acquaintance of mine was just now telling me, would be very proper for this End if it could be related with all the Circumstances as I heard it this Evening; for it touched me so much, that I cannot forbear entring upon it.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Eustace,</HI> a young Gentleman of a good Estate near <HI>Dublin</HI> in <HI>Ireland,</HI> married a Lady of Youth, Beauty, and Modesty, and lived with her in gene∣ral with much Ease and Tranquility; but was in his secret Temper impatient of Rebuke: She is apt to fall into little Sallies of Passion, yet as sud∣denly recalled by her own Reflection on her Fault, and the Consideration of her Husband's Temper. It happened, as he, his Wife, and her Sister, were at Supper together about Two Months ago, that in the Midst of a careless and familiar Conversa∣tion, the Sisters fell into a little Warmth and Con∣tradiction. He, who was one of that Sort of Men who are never unconcerned at what passes before them, fell into an outragious Passion on the Side of the Sister. The Person about whom they disputed was so near, that they were under no Restraint from running into vain Repetitions of past Heats: On which Occasion all the Aggravations of Anger and Distast boiled up, and were repeated with the Bitterness of exasperated Lovers. The Wife ob∣serving her Husband extremely moved, began to turn it off, and rally him for interposing between Two People who from their Infancy had been an∣gry and pleased with each other every Half Hour. But it descended deeper into his Thoughts, and they broke up with a sullen Silence. The Wife immediately retired to her Chamber, whither her Husband soon after followed. When they were
<PB N="288" REF="295"/>
in Bed, he soon dissembled a Sleep, and she, plea∣sed that his Thoughts were composed, fell into a real one. Their Apartment was very distant from the rest of their Family, in a lonely Country House. He now saw his Opportunity, and with a Dagger he had brought to Bed with him, stabbed his Wife in the Side. She awaked in the highest Terrour; but immediately imagined it was a Blow design'd for her Husband by Ruffians, began to grasp him, and strove to awake and rouze him to defend him∣self. He still pretended himself sleeping, and gave her a second Wound.</P>
<P>She now drew open the Curtains, and by the Help of Moon-light saw his Hand lifted up to stab her. The Horror disarmed her from further Struggling; and he enraged anew at being disco∣vered, fixed his Poniard in her Bosom. As soon as he believed he had dispatched her, he attempt∣ed to escape out of the Window: But she, still alive, called to him not to hurt himself; for she might live. He was so stung with the insupport∣able Reflection upon her Goodness and his own Villany, that he jumped to the Bed, and wounded her all over with as much Rage as if every Blow was provoked by new Aggravations. In this Fury of Mind he fled away. His Wife had still Strength to go to her Sister's Apartment, and give her an Account of this wonderful Tragedy; but died the next Day. Some Weeks after, an Officer of Justice, in attempting to seize the Criminal, fired upon him, as did the Criminal upon the Officer. Both their Balls took Place, and both immediately expired.</P>

<P>WHEN I first began to learn to push this last Winter, my Master had a great deal of Work upon his Hands to make me unlearn the Postures and Motions which I had got by having <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n my younger Years practised Back-Sword, with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> little Eye to the Single Falchion.

By this Means I was for defend∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng my Head when the <HI>French</HI> Gentleman was making a full Pass at my Bosom, insomuch that he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>old me I was fairly killed Seven Times in one Morning, without having done my Master any <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ther Mischief than one Knock on the Pate. This was a great Misfortune to me; and I believe I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay say, without Vanity, I am the first who ever <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>shed so erroneously; and yet conquered the Pre∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>dice of Education so well, as to make my Passes <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> clear, and recover Hand and Foot with that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>gility, as I do at this Day.

them in their future Lives, they are all promis∣cuously instructed the same Way; and <HI>Horace</HI> and <HI>Virgil</HI> must be thrummed by a Boy as well before he goes to an Apprenticeship as to the Univer∣sity. This ridiculous Way of treating the Under∣aged of this Island has very often raised both my Spleen and Mirth, but I think never both at once so much as to Day. A good Mother of our Neighbourhood made me a Visit with her Son and Heir, a Lad somewhat above Five Foot, and wants but little of the Height and Strength of a good Musquetier in any Regiment in the Service. Her Business was to desire I would examine him, for he was far gone in a Book, the first Letters of which she often saw in my Papers. The Youth produced it, and I found it was my Friend <HI>Ho∣race.</HI> It was very easy to turn to the Place the Boy was learning in, which was the Fifth Ode of the First Book of <HI>Pyrrha.</HI> I read it over aloud, as well because I am always delighted when I turn to the beautiful Parts of that Author, as also to gain Time for considering a little how to keep up the Mother's Pleasure in her Child, which I thought Barbarity to interrupt. In the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Place I asked him, Who this same <HI>Pyrrhus</HI> was? He answered very readily, She was the Wife of <HI>Pyrrhus,</HI> one of <HI>Alexander</HI>'s Captains I lifted up my Hands. The Mother courtesies—Nay, says she,—I knew you would stand in Admiration.—I assure you, continued she, for all he looks so tall, he is but very young Pray ask him some more, never spare him. Win that I took the Liberty to ask him, What was the Character of this Gentlewoman? He read the Three first Verses:</P>
<Q><L>Quis multa gracilis te Puer in rosa</L>
<L>Perfusus liquidis urget Odoribus</L>
<L>Grate, Pyrrha, sub Antro?</L></Q>
<P><PB N="291" REF="298"/>
And very gravely told me, She lived at the Sign of the <HI>Rose</HI> in a Cellar. I took Care to be very much astonished at the Lad's Improvements; but withal advised her, as soon as possible, to take him from School, for he could learn no more there. This very silly Dialogue was a lively Image of the impertinent Method used in breeding Boys without Genius or Spirit, to the reading Things for which their Heads were never framed. But this is the natural Effect of a certain Vanity in the Minds of Parents, who are wonderfully de∣lighted with the Thought of breeding their Chil∣dren to Accomplishments, which they believe no∣thing but Want of the same Care in their own Fathers prevented them from being Masters of. Thus it is, that the Part of Life most fir for Im∣provement, is generally 'employed in a Method against the Bent of Nature; and a Lad of such Parts as are fit for an Occupation, where there can be no Calls out of the beaten Path, is Two or Three Years of his Time wholly taken up in knowing how well <HI>Ovid</HI>'s Mistress became such a Dress; how such a Nymph for her Cruelty was changed into such an Animal; and how it is made generous in <HI>Aeneas</HI> to put <HI>Turnus</HI> to Death. Gallantries that can no more come within the Oc∣currences of the Lives of ordinary Men, than they can be relished by their Imaginations. How∣ever, still the Humour goes on from one Genera∣tion to another; and the Pastry-Cook here in the Lane the other Night told me, He would not yet take away his Son from his Learning, but has resolved, as soon as he had a little Smattering in the Greek, to put him Apprentice to a Soap-boyl∣er. These wrong Beginnings determine our Suc∣cess in the World; and when our Thoughts are originally falsly biassed, their Agility and Force do but carry us the further out of our Way in Proportion to our Speed. But we are half Way our Journey when we have got into the right
<PB N="292" REF="299"/>
Road. If all our Days were usefully employed, and we did not set out impertinently, we should not have so many grotesque Proressors in all the Arts of Life, but every Man would be in a pro∣per and becoming Method of distinguishing or entertaining himself suitably to what Nature de∣signed him. As they go on now, our Parents do not only force us upon what is against our Ta∣lents, but our Teachers are also as injudicious in what they put us to learn. I have hardly ever since suffered so much by the Charms of any Beauty, as I did before I had a Sense of Passion, for not apprehending that the Smile of <HI>Lalage</HI> was what pleased <HI>Horace;</HI> and I verily believe, the Stripes I suffered about <HI>Digito male p rtinaci,</HI> has given that irreconcilable Aversion, which I shall carry to my Grave, against Coquets.</P>
<P>As for the elegant Writer of whom I am talk∣ing, his Excellencies are to be observed as they relate to the different Concerns of his Life; and he is always to be looked upon as a Lover, a Cour∣tier, or a Man of Wit. His admirable Odes have numberless Instances of his Merit in each of these Characters. His Epistles and Satyrs are full of proper Notices for the Conduct of Life in a Court; and what we call Good Breeding, most agreeably intermixed with his Morality. His Addresses to the Persons who favoured him are so inimitably engaging, that <HI>Augustus</HI> complained of him for so seldom writing to him, and asked him, Whether he was afraid Posterity should read their Names together? Now for the Generality of Men to spend much Time in such Writings, is as plea∣sant a Folly as any he ridicules. Whatever the Crowd of Scholars may pretend, if their Way of Life, or their own Imaginations, do not lead then to a Tast of him, they may read, nay write, Fifty Volumes upon him, and be just as they were when they began. I remember to have heard a great Painter say, There are certain Faces for
<PB N="293" REF="300"/>
certain Painters, as well as certain Subjects for certain Poets. This is as true in the Choice of Studies, and no one will ever relish an Author thoroughly well, who would not have been fit Company for that Author had they lived at the same Time. All others are Mechanicks in Learn∣ing, and take the Sentiments of Writers like Waiting-Servants, who report what passed at their Masters Table; but debase every Thought and Expression, for want of the Air with which they were uttered.</P>

<P>THE Learned <HI>Scotus,</HI> to distinguish the Race of Mankind, gives every Individual of that Species what he calls a Seity, something peculiar to himself, which makes him different from all other Persons in the World. This Particularity renders him either venerable or ridiculous, ac∣cording as he uses his Talents, which always grow out into Faults, or improve into Virtues. In the Office I have undertaken, you are to observe, That I have hitherto presented only the more insignifi∣cant and lazy Part of Mankind under the Deno∣mination of Dead Men, together with the De∣grees towards Non-Existence, in which others can neither be said to live or be defunct, but are only Animals meerly dressed up like Men, and differ from each other but as Flies do by a little Co∣louring
<PB N="294" REF="301"/>
or Fluttering of their Wings. Now as our Discourses heretofore have chiefly regarded the Indolent Part of the Species, it remains that we do Justice also upon the impertinently Active and Enterprizing. Such as these I shall take par∣ticular Care to place in safe Custody, and have used all possible Diligence to run up my Edifice in <HI>Moorfields</HI> for that Service.</P>
<P>We who are adept in Astrology, can impute it to several Causes in the Planets, That this Quarter of our great City is the Region of such Persons as either never had, or have lost, the Use of Reason. It has indeed been Time out of Mind the Recep∣tacle of Fools as well as Madmen. The Care and Information of the former I assign to other learned Men, who have for that End taken up their Ha∣bitation in those Parts; as, among others, to the famous Dr. <HI>Trotter,</HI> and my ingenious Friend Dr. <HI>Langham.</HI> These oraculous Proficients are Day and Night employed in deep Searches, for the Direction of such as run astray after their lost Goods: But at present they are more parti∣cularly serviceable to their Country, in foretelling the Fate of such as have Chances in the Publick Lottery. Dr. <HI>Langham</HI> shows a peculiar Genero∣sity on this Occasion, taking only one Half-Crown for a Prediction, Eighteen Pence of which to be paid out of the Prizes; which Method the Doctor is willing to comply with in Favour of every Ad∣venturer in the whole Lottery. Leaving there∣fore the whole Generation of such Enquirers to such <HI>Litcrati</HI> as I have now mentioned, we are to proceed towards Peopling our House, which we have erected with the greatest Cost and Care imaginable.</P>
<P>It is necessary in this Place to premise, That the Superiority and Force of Mind which is born with Men of great Genius; and which, when it falls in with a noble Imagination, is called Poeti∣cal Fury, does not come under my Consideration:
<PB N="295" REF="302"/>
but the Pretence to such an Impulse without na∣tural Warmth, shall be allowed a fit Object of this Charity; and all the Volumes written by such Hands, shall be from Time to Time placed in proper Order upon the Rails of the unhoused Booksellers within the District of the College, (who have long inhabited this Quarter) in the same Manner as they are al eady disposed soon after their Publication. I promise my self from these Writings my best Opiates for those Patients, whose high Imaginations, and hot Spirits, have waked them into Distraction. Their boiling Tem∣pers are not to be wrought upon by my Gruels and Julips, but must ever be employed, or appear to be so, or their Recovery will be impracticable. I shall therefore make Use of such Poets as pre∣serve so constant a Mediocrity, as never to elevate the Mind into Joy, or depress it into Sadness, yet at the same Time keep the Faculties of the Rea∣ders in Suspence, tho' they introduce no Idea's of their own. By this Means, a disordered Mind, like a broken Limb, will recover its Strength by the sole Benefit of being out of Use, and lying without Motion. But as Reading is not an Enter∣tainment that can take up the full Time of my Patients, I have now in Pension a proportionable Number of Story-Tellers, who are by Turns to walk about the Galleries of the House, and by their Narrations second the Labours of my pretty good Poets. There are among these Story-Tel∣lers some that have so earnest Countenances, and weighty Brows, that they will draw a Madman, even when his Fit is just coming on, into a Whis∣per, and by the Force of Shrugs, Nods, and busy Gestures, make him stand amazed so long as that we may have Time to give him his Broth without Danger.</P>
<P>But as Fortune has the Possession of Men's Minds, a Physician may cure all the sick People of ordi∣nary Degree in the whole Town and never come
<PB N="296" REF="303"/>
into Reputation. I shall therefore begin with Persons of Condition; and the first I shall under∣take, shall be the Lady <HI>Fidget,</HI> the general Visitant, and <HI>Will Voluble,</HI> the fine Talker. These Persons shall be first locked up, for the Peace of all whom the one visits, and all whom the other talks to.</P>
<P>The Passion which first touched the Brain of both these Persons, was Envy; and has had such wondrous Effects, that to this, Lady <HI>Fidget</HI> owes that she is so courteous; to this, <HI>Will Voluble</HI> that he is eloquent. <HI>Fidget</HI> has a restless Torment in hearing of any one's Prosperity, and cannot know any Quiet till she visits her, and is Eye-Witness of something that lessens it. Thus her Life is a continual Search after what does not concern her, and her Companions speak kindly even of the Absent and the Unfortunate, to teaze her. She was the first that visited <HI>Flavia</HI> after the Small-pox, and has never seen her since because she is not altered. Call a young Woman hand∣some in her Company, and she tells you, It is pity she has no Fortune: Say she is rich, and she is as sorry that she is silly. With all this ill Nature, <HI>Fidget</HI> is her self young, rich, and handsome; but loses the Pleasure of all those Qualities, because she has them in common with others.</P>
<P>To make up her Misery, she is well-bred, she hears Commendations till she is ready to faint for Want of venting her self in Contradictions. This Madness is not expressed by the Voice; but is ut∣tered in the Eyes and Features: Its first Symp∣tom is upon beholding an agreeable Object, a sudden Approbation immediately checked with Dislike.</P>
<P>This Lady I shall take the Liberty to conduct into a Bed of Straw and Darkness, and have some Hopes, that after long Absence from the Light, the Pleasure of seeing at all may reconcile her to what she shall see, tho' it proves to be never so agreeable.</P>

<P>This Evening a Mail from <HI>Holland</HI> brought the following Advices:</P>
<P><HI>From the Camp before</HI> Douay, May 26. <HI>N. S.</HI> On the 23d the <HI>French</HI> assembled their Army, and en∣camped with their Right near <HI>Bouchain,</HI> and their Left near <HI>Creuveuceur.</HI> Upon this Motion of the Enemy, the Duke of <HI>Marlborough</HI> and Prince <HI>Eu∣gene</HI> made a Movement with their Army on the 24th, and encamped from <HI>Arlieux</HI> to <HI>Vitry</HI> and <HI>Isez-Esquerchien,</HI> where they are so advantagiously posted, that they not only cover the Siege, secure our Convoys of Provisions, Forage, and Ammu∣nition, from <HI>Lisle</HI> and <HI>Tournay,</HI> and the Canals and Dikes we have made to turn the Water of the <HI>Scarp</HI> and <HI>La Cense</HI> to <HI>Bouchain;</HI> but are in a Readiness, by marching from the Right, to pos∣sess themselves of the Field of Battle marked out betwixt <HI>Vitry</HI> and <HI>Montigny,</HI> or from the Left to gain the Lines of Circumvallation betwixt <HI>Fierin</HI> and <HI>Dechy:</HI> So that whatever Way the Enemy shall approach to attack us whether by the Plains of <HI>Lens,</HI> or by <HI>Bouchain</HI> and <HI>Valenciennes,</HI> we have but a very small Movement to make, to possess our selves of the Ground on which it will be most advantagious to receive them. The Enemy march∣ed this Morning from their Left, and are encamp∣ed with their Right at <HI>Oisy,</HI> and their Left to∣wards <HI>Aeras,</HI> and, according to our Advices, will pass the <HI>Scarp</HI> to Morrow and enter on the Plains
<PB N="298" REF="305"/>
of <HI>Lens,</HI> though several Regiments of Horse, the <HI>German</HI> and <HI>Liege</HI> Troops, which are destined to compose Part of their Army, have not yet joined them. If they pass the <HI>Scarp,</HI> we shall do the like at the same Time, to possess our selves with all possible Advantage of the Field of Battle: But if they continue where they are, we shall not re∣move, because in our present Station we suffici∣ently cover from all Insults both our Siege and Convoys.</P>
<P>Monsieur <HI>Villars</HI> cannot yet go without Crut∣ches, and 'tis believed will have much Difficulty to ride. He and the Duke of <HI>Berwick</HI> are to com∣mand the <HI>French</HI> Army, the rest of the Mareschals being only to assist in Council.</P>
<P>Last Night we entirely perfected Four Bridges over the <HI>Avant Fosse</HI> at both Attacks; and our Saps are so far advanced, that in Three or Four Days Batteries will be raised on the Glacis, to bat∣ter in Breach both the Outworks and Ramparts of the Town.</P>
<P>Letters from the <HI>Hague</HI> of the 27th, <HI>N. S.</HI> say, That the Deputies of the States of <HI>Holland,</HI> who set out for <HI>Gertruydenberg</HI> on the 23d, to renew the Conferences with the <HI>French</HI> Ministers, returned on the 26th, and had communicated to the States General the new Overtures that were made on the Part of <HI>France,</HI> which it is believed, if they are in Earnest, may produce a general Treaty.</P>

<P>IN the Distribution of the Apartments in the New <HI>Bedlam,</HI> proper Regard is had to the different Sexes, and the Lodgings accommodated accordingly. Among other Necessaries, as I have thought fit to appoint Story-Tellers to sooth the Men, so I have allowed Tale-Bearers to indulge the Intervals of my Female Patients. But before I enter upon disposing of the Main of the great Body that wants my Assistance, it is necessary to consider the Humane Race abstracted from all other Distinctions and Considerations except that of Sex. This will lead us to a nearer View of their Excellencies and Imperfections, which are to be accounted the one or the other, as they are suitable to the Design for which the Persons so defective or accomplished came into the World.</P>
<P>To make this Enquiry aright, we must speak of the Life of People of Condition, and the pro∣portionable Applications to those below them will be easily made, so as to value the whole Spe∣cies by the same Rule. We will begin with the Woman, and behold her as a Virgin in her Fa∣ther's House. This State of her Life is infinitely more delightful than that of her Brother at the same Age. While she is entertained with learn∣ing melodious Airs at her Spinet, is led round a Room in the most complaisant Manner to a Fid∣dle, or is entertained with Applauses of her Beauty and Perfection in the ordinary Conversa∣tion she meets with, the young Man is under the Dictates of a rigid Schoolmaster or Instructor.
<PB N="300" REF="307"/>
contradicted in every Word he speaks, and curb∣ed in all the Inclinations he discovers. Mrs. <HI>Eli∣zabeth</HI> is the Object of Desire and Admiration looked upon with Delight, courted with all the Powers of Eloquence and Address, approached with a certain Worship, and defended with a cer∣tain Loyalty. This is her Case as to the World: In her Domestick Character, she is the Compa∣nion, the Friend, and Confident of her Mother, and the Object of a Pleasure something like the Love between Angels, to her Father. Her Youth, her Beauty, her Air, are by him looked upon with an ineffable Transport beyond any other Joy in this Life, with as much Purity as can be met with in the next.</P>
<P>Her Brother <HI>William,</HI> at the same Years, is but in the Rudiments of those Acquisitions which must gain him Esteem in the World. Hi Heart beats for Applause among Men, yet is he fearful of every Step towards it. If he proposes to him∣self to make a Figure in the World, his Youth is damped with a Prospect of Difficulties, Dangers, and Dishonours; and an Opposition in all gene∣rous Attempts, whether they regard his Love or his Ambition.</P>
<P>In the next Stage of Life she has little else to do, but (what she is accomplished for by the meer Gifts of Nature) to appear lovely and agree∣able to her Husband, tender to her Children, and affable to her Servants: But a Man, when he en∣ters into this Way, is but in the first Scene, far from the Accomplishment of his Designs. He is now in all Things to act for others as well as himself. He is to have Industry and Frugality in his private Affairs, and Integrity and Addresses in Publick. To these Qualities, he must add a Cou∣rage and Resolution to support his other Abilities, lest he be interrupted in the Prosecution of his just Endeavours, in which the Honour and In∣terest
<PB N="301" REF="308"/>
of Posterity are as much concerned as his own personal Welfare.</P>
<P>This little Sketch may in some Measure give an Idea of the different Parts which the Sexes have to act, and the advantagious as well as in∣convenient Terms on which they are to enter upon their several Parts of Life. This may also be some Rule to us in the Examination of their Conduct. In short, I shall take it for a Maxim, That a Woman who resigns the Purpose of being pleasing, and the Man who gives up the Thoughts of being wise, do equally quit their Claim to the true Causes of Living; and are to be allowed the Diet and Discipline of my charitable Structure to reduce them to Rea∣son.</P>
<P>On the other Side, the Woman who hopes to please by Mothods which should make her odious, and the Man who would be thought wise by a Behaviour that renders him ridiculous, are to be taken into Custody for their false Industry, as Justly as they ought for their Negligence.</P>

<P>Advices from <HI>Flanders</HI> of the 30th Instant, <HI>N. S.</HI> say, That the Duke of <HI>Marlborough</HI> having Intel∣ligence of the Enemy's passing the <HI>Scarp</HI> on the 29th in the Evening, and their March towards the Plains of <HI>Lens,</HI> had put the Confederate Ar∣my in Motion, which was advancing towards the Camp on the North Side of that River be∣tween <HI>Vitry</HI> and <HI>Henin-Lietard.</HI> The Confede∣rates, since the Approach of the Enemy, have added several new Redoubts to their Camp, and drawn the Cannon out of the Lines of Circum∣vallation in a Readiness for the Batteries.</P>
<P><PB N="302" REF="309"/>
It is not believed, notwithstanding these Ap∣pearances, that the Enemy will hazard a Battle for the Relief of <HI>Douay;</HI> the Siege of which Place is carried on with all the Success that can be expected, considering the Difficulties they meet with occasioned by the Inundations. On the 28th at Night we made a Lodgment on the Sa∣liant Angle of the Glacis of the Second Counter∣scarp, and our Approaches are so far advanced, that it is believed the Town will be obliged to surrender before the 8th of the next Month.</P>

<P>THIS Evening, after a little Ease from the raging Pain caused by so small an Organ as an aking Tooth, under which I had behaved my self so ill as to have broke Two Pipes and my Spectacles, I began to reflect with Admiration on those Heroick Spirits, which in the Conduct of their Lives seem to live so much above the Con∣dition of our Make, as not only under the Ago∣nies of Pain to forbear any intemperate Word or Gesture, but also in their general and ordinary Behaviour to resist the Impulses of their very Blood and Constitution. This Watch over a Man's self, and the Command of his Temper, I take to be the greatest of Humane Perfections, and is the Effect of a strong and resolute Mind. It is not only the most expedient Practice for
<PB N="303" REF="310"/>
carrying on our own Designs, but is also very de∣servedly the most amiable Quality in the Sight of others. It is a winning Deference to Mankind, which creates an immediate Imitation of it self wherever it appears, and prevails upon all (who have to do with a Person endued with it) either through Shame or Emulation. I do not know how to express this Habit of Mind, except you will let me call it Equanimity. It is a Virtue, which is necessary at every Hour, in every Place, and in all Conversations, and is the Effect of a regular and exact Prudence. He that will look back upon all the Acquaintances he has had in his whole Life, will find, he has seen more Men capable of the greatest Employments and Perfor∣mances, than such as could in the general Bent of their Carriage act otherwise than according to their own Complexion and Humour. But the Indulgence of our selves in wholly giving Way to our natural Propensity, is so unjust and improper a Licence, that when People take it up, there is very little Difference, with Relation to their Friends and Families, whether they are good or ill-natured Men: For he that errs by being wrought upon by what we call the Sweetness of his Temper, is as guilty as he that offends thro' the Perverseness of it.</P>
<P>It is not therefore to be regarded what Men are in themselves, but what they are in their Actions. <HI>Eucrates</HI> is the best-natured of all Men; but that natural Softness has Effects quite con∣trary to it self, and for Want of due Bounds to his Benevolence, while he has a Will to be a Friend to all, he has the Power of being such to none. His constant Inclination to please, makes him never fail of doing so; tho' (without being capable of Falshood) he is a Friend only to those who are present; for the same Humour which makes him the best Companion, renders him the worst Correspondent. It is a melancholy Thing
<PB N="304" REF="311"/>
to consider, that the most engaging Sort of Men in Conversation are frequently the most tyranni∣cal in Power, and least to be depended upon in Friendship. It is certain this is not to be imputed to their own Disposition; but he that is to be led by others, has only good Luck if he is not the worst, though in himself the best Man living. For this Reason, we are no more wholly to in∣dulge our good, than our ill Dispositions. I re∣member a crafty old Cit, one Day speaking of a well-natured young Fellow who set up with a good Stock in <HI>Lombard-street,</HI> <Q REND="inline">"I will, says he, lay no more Money in his Hands, for he never de∣nied me any Thing."</Q> This was a very base, but with him a prudential Reason for breaking off Commerce: And this Acquaintance of mine car∣ried this Way of Judging so far, that he has often told me, he never cared to deal with a Man he liked, for that our Affections must never enter into our Business.</P>
<P>When we look round us in this populous City, and consider how Credit and Esteem are lodged, you find Men have a great Share of the former, without the least Portion of the latter. He who knows himself for a Beast of Prey, looks upon others in the same Light, and we are so apt to judge of others by our selves, that the Man who has no Mercy, is as careful as possible never to want it. Hence it is, that in many Instances Men gain Credit by the very contrary Methods by which they do Esteem; for wary Traders think every Affection of the Mind a Key to their Cash.</P>
<P>But what led me into this Discourse, was my Impatience of Pain; and I have, to my great Disgrace, seen an Instance of the contrary Car∣riage in so high a Degree, that I am out of Countenance that I ever read <HI>Seneca.</HI> When I look upon the Conduct of others in such Occur∣rences, as well as behold their Equanimity in the
<PB N="305" REF="312"/>
general Tenour of their Life, it very much abates the Self-Love, which is seldom well governed by any Sort of Men, and least of all by us Au∣thors.</P>
<P>The Fortitude of a Man who brings his Will to the Obedience of his Reason, is conspicuous, and carries with it a Dignity in the lowest State imaginable. Poor <HI>Martius,</HI> who now lies lan∣guishing in the most violent Fever, discovers in the faintest Moments of his Distemper such a Greatness of Mind, that a perfect Stranger who should now behold him, would indeed see an Object of Pity, but at the same Time that it was lately an Object of Veneration. His gal∣lant Spirit resigns, but resigns with an Air that speaks a Resolution which could yield to nothing but Fate it self. This is Conquest in the Philo∣sophick Sense; but the Empire over our selves is, methinks, no less laudable in common Life, where the whole Tenour of a Man's Carriage is in Subservience to his own Reason, and Confor∣mity both to the good Sense and Inclination of other Men.</P>
<P><HI>Aristaeus</HI> is in my Opinion a perfect Master of himself in all Circumstances. He has all the Spirit that Man can have, and yet is as regular in his Behaviour as a meer Machine. He is sen∣sible of every Passion, but ruffled by none. In Conversation, he frequently seems to be less knowing to be more obliging, and chuses to be on a Level with others rather than oppress with the Superiority of his Genius. In Friendship, he is kind without Profession. In Business, ex∣peditious without Ostentation. With the greatest Softness and Benevolence imaginable, he is im∣partial in Spight of all Importunity, even that of his own good Nature. He is ever clear in his Judgment; but in Complaisance to his Com∣pany, speaks with Doubt, and never shows Con∣fidence in Argument, but to support the Sense of
<PB N="306" REF="313"/>
another. Were such an Equality of Mind the general Endeavour of all Men, How sweet would be the Pleasures of Conversation? He that is loud would then understand, that we ought to call a Constable, and know, that spoiling good Company is the most heinous Way of breaking the Peace. We should then be relieved from these Zealots in Society, who take upon them to be angry for all the Company, and quarrel with the Waiters to show they have no Respect for any Body else in the Room. To be in a Rage before you, is in a Kind being angry with you. You may as well stand naked before Company, as to use such Familiarities; and to be careless of what you say, is the most clownish Way of being undressed.</P>

<P>I Have a good Fortune, partly paternal, and partly acquired. My younger Years I spent in Business; but Age coming on, and having no more Children than one Daughter, I re∣solved to be a Slave no longer: And accord∣ingly I have disposed of my Effects, placed my Money in the Funds, bought a pretty Seat in a pleasant Country, am making a Gar∣den, and have set up a Pack of little Bea∣gles. I live in the Midst of a good many well∣bred Neighbours, and several well-tempered Clergy-men. Against a rainy Day I have a lit∣tle Library; and against the Gout in my Sto∣mach, a little good Claret. With all this I am the miserablest Man in the World; not that

<P>THE ingenious Mr. <HI>Penkethman;</HI> the Come∣dian, has lately left here a Paper or Ticket, to which is affixed a small Silver Medal, which is to entitle the Bearer to see One and twenty Plays at his Theatre for a Guinea. <HI>Greenwith</HI> is the Place where, it seems, he has erected h s House; and his Time of Action is to be so contri∣ved, that it is to fall in with going and returning with the Tide. Besides, that the Bearer of this Ticket may carry down with him a particular Set of Company to the Play, striking off for each Person so introduced one of his Twenty one Times of Admittance. In this Warrant of his, he has made me an high Compliment in a face∣tious Distich, by Way of Dedication of his En∣deavours, and desires I would recommend them to the World. I must needs say, I have not for some Time seen a properer Choice than he has made of a Patron: Who more fit to publish his Work than a Novelist? Who to recommend it than a Censor? This Honour done me, has made me turn my Thoughts upon the Nature of Dedi∣cations in general, and the Abuse of that Cu∣stom, as well by a long Practice of my Predeces∣sors, as the continued Folly of my contemporary Authors.</P>
<P><PB N="309" REF="316"/>
In ancient Times, it was the Custom to ad∣dress their Works to some eminent for their Merit to Mankind, or particular Patronage of the Wri∣ters themselves, or Knowledge in the Matter of which they treated. Under these Regards, it was a memorable Honour to both Parties, and a very agreeable Record of their Commerce with each other. These Applications were never stuf∣fed with impertinent Praises, but were the native Product of their Esteem, which was implicitly re∣ceived, or generally known to be due to the Patron of the Week: But vain Flourishes came into the World, with other barbarous Embellishments; and the Enumeration of Titles, and great Actions, in the Patrons themselves, or their Sires, are as foreign to the Matter in Hand as the Ornaments are in a <HI>Gothick</HI> Building. This is clapping to∣gether Persons which have no Manner of Alli∣ance, and can for that Reason have no other Ef∣fect than making both Parties justly ridiculous. What Pretence is there in Nature for me to write to a great Man, and tell him, My Lord, because your Grace is a Duke, your Grace's Father before you was an Earl, his Lordship's Father was a Baron, and his Lordship's Father both a wise and a rich Man; I <HI>Isaac Bickerstaff</HI> am obliged, and could not possibly forbear addressing to you the following Treatise. Though this is the plain Exposition of all I could possibly say to him with a good Conscience, yet the silly Custom has so universally prevailed, that my Lord Duke and I must necessarily be particular Friends from this Time forward, or else I have just Room for be∣ing disobliged, and may turn my Panegyrick in∣to a Libel. But to carry this Affair still more Home; were it granted that Praises in Dedications were proper Topicks, What is it that gives a Man Authority to commend, or what makes it a Favour to me that he does commend me? It is certain, that there is no Praise valuable but from
<PB N="310" REF="317"/>
the Praise-worthy. Were it otherwise, Blame might be as much in the same Hands. Were the Good and Evil of Fame laid upon a Level among Mankind, the Judge on the Bench, and the Cri∣minal at the Bar, would differ only in their Sta∣tions; and if one's Word is to pass as much as the other's, their Reputation would be much alike to the Jury. <HI>Pliny</HI> speaking of the Death of <HI>Martial,</HI> expresses himself with great Gratitude to him for the Honours done him in the Writings of that Author; but he begins it with an Ac∣count of his Character, whsch only made the Applause valuable. He indeed in the same Epi∣stle says, It is Sign we have left off doing Things which deserve Praise, when we think Commendation impertinent. This is asserted with a just Regard to the Persons whose good Opinion we wish for; otherwise Reputation would be valued according to the Number of Voices a Man has for it, which are not always to be insured on the more virtuous Side. But how∣ever we pretend to model these nice Affairs, true Glory will never attend any Thing but Truth; and there is something so peculiar in it, that the very self-same Action done by different Men can∣not merit the same Degree of Applause. The <HI>Roman,</HI> who was surprized in the Enemy's Camp before he had accomplished his Design, and thrust his bare Arm into a flaming Pile, telling the General, There were many as determined as himself who (against Sense of Danger) had con∣spired his Death, wrought in the very Enemy an Admiration of his Fortitude, and a Dismission with Applause. But the condemned Slave who represented him in the Theatre, and consumed his Arm in the same Manner, with the same Re∣solution, did not raise in the Spectators a great Idea of his Virtue, but of him whom imitated in an Action no Way differing from that of the real <HI>Scaevola,</HI> but in the Motive to it.</P>
<P><PB N="311" REF="318"/>
Thus true Glory is inseparable from true Merit, and whatever you call Men, they are are no more than what they are in themselves; but a Roman∣tcik Sense has crept into the Minds of the Gene∣rality, who will ever mistake Words and Appear∣ances for Persons and Things.</P>
<P>The Simplicity of the Ancients was as conspi∣cuous in the Address of their Writings, as in any other Monuments they have left behind them. <HI>Caesar</HI> and <HI>Augustus</HI> were much more high Words of Respect, when added to Occasions fit for their Characters to appear in, than any Appellations which have ever been since thought of. The lat∣ter of these great Men had a very pleasant Way of dealing with Applications of this Kind. When he received Pieces of Poetry which he thought had Worth in them, he rewarded the Writer; but where he thought them empty, he generally returned the Compliment made him with some Verses of his own.</P>
<P>This latter Method I have at present Occasion to imitate. A Female Author has dedicated a Piece to me, wherein she would make my Name (as she has others) the Introduction of whatever is to follow in her Book; and has spoke some Panegyrical Things which I know not how to return, for Want of better Acquaintance with the Lady, and consequently being out of a Capacity of giving her Praise or Blame. All therefore that is left for me, according to the foregoing Rules, is to lay the Picture of a good and evil Woman be∣fore her Eyes, which are but meet Words if they do not concern her. Now you are to observe, the Way in a Dedication is to make all the rest of the World as little like the Person we address to as possible, according to the following Epistle:</P>

<P>WHEN we look into the delightful History of the most ingenious <HI>Don Quixot</HI> of the <HI>Mancha,</HI> and consider the Exercises and Manner of Life of that renowned Gentleman, we cannot but admire the exquisite Genius and discerning Spirit of <HI>Michael Cervantes,</HI> who has not only painted his Adventurer with great Mastery in the conspicuous Parts of his Story, which relate to Love and Honour, but also intimated in his ordi∣nary Life, Oeconomy and Furniture, the infalli∣ble Symptoms he gave of his growing Phrensy, before he declared himself a Knight-Errant. His Hall was furnished with old Launces, Halbards, and Morrions; his Food, Lentils; his Dress, amorous. He slept moderately, rose early, and spent his Time in Hunting. When by Watchful∣ness and Exercise he was thus qualified for the Hardships of his intended Peregrinations, he had nothing more to do but to fall hard to study; and before he should apply himself to the Practi∣cal Part, get into the Methods of making Love and War by reading Books of Knighthood. As for raising tender Passion in him, <HI>Cervantes</HI> re∣ports, That he was wonderfully delighted with a smooth intricate Sentence; and when they listened at his Study-Door, they could frequently hear him read aloud, <HI>The Reason of the Unreaso∣nableness, which against my Reason is wrought, doth so weaken my Reason, as with all Reason I do justly complain on your Beauty.</HI> Again, he would pause till he came to another charming Sentence,

and with the most pleasing Accent imaginable be loud at a new Paragraph: <HI>The high Heavens, which, with your Divinity, do fortify you divinely with the Stars, make you Deserveress of the De∣serts that your Greatness deserves.</HI> With these, and other such Passages, <HI>(say's my Author)</HI> the poor Gentleman grew distracted, and was break∣ing his Brains Day and Night to understand and unravel their Sense.</P>
<P>As much as the Case of this distempered Knight is received by all the Readers of his History as the most incurable and ridiculous of all Phren∣sies, it is very certain we have Crowds among us far gone in as visible a Madness as his, though they are not observed to be in that Condition. As great and useful Discoveries are sometimes made by accidental and small Beginnings, I came to the Knowledge of the most Epidemick Ill of this Sort, by falling into a Coffee-house where I saw my Friend the Upholsterer, whose Crack to∣wards Politicks I have heretofore mention'd. This Touch in the Brain of the <HI>British</HI> Subject, is as certainly owing to the reading News-Papers, as that of the <HI>Spanish</HI> Worthy above-mention'd to the reading Works of Chivalry. My Contem∣poraries the Novelists have, for the better spin∣ning out Paragraphs, and working down to the End of their Columns, a most happy Art in Say∣ing and Unsaying, giving Hints of Intelligence, and Interpretations of indifferent Actions, to the great Distur bance of the Brains of ordinary Rea∣ders. This Way of going on in the Words, and making no Progress in the Sense, is more parti∣cularly the Excellence of my most ingenious and renowned Fellow-Labourer, the <HI>Post-Man;</HI> and it as to this Talent in him that I impute the Loss of my Upholsterer's Intellects. That unfortunate Tradesman has for Years past been the chief Ora∣tor in ragged Assemblies, and the Reader in Al∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>y Coffee-houses. He was Yesterday surroun∣ded
<PB N="314" REF="321"/>
by an Audience of that Sort, among whom I sat unobserved through the Favour of a Cloud of Tobacco, and saw him with the <HI>Post-Man</HI> in his Hand, and all the other Papers safe under his Left Elbow. He was intermixing Remarks, and reading the <HI>Paris</HI> Article of <HI>May</HI> 30. which says, <HI>That it is given out that an Express arrived this Day, with Advice, that the Armies were so near in the Plain of</HI> Lens, <HI>that they cannonaded each other.</HI> (Ay, ay, here we shall have Sport.) <HI>And that it was highly probable the next Express would bring us an Account of an Engagement.</HI> (They are welcome as soon as they please.) <HI>The some others say, That the same will be put off ti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> the</HI> 2<HI>d or</HI> 3<HI>d of</HI> June, <HI>because the Mareschal</HI> Vil∣lars <HI>expects some further Reinforcements from</HI> Ger∣many, <HI>and other Parts, before that Time.</HI> What-a-Pox does he put it off for? Does he think our Horse is not marching up at the same Time? But let us see what he says further. <HI>They hope, that Monsieur</HI> Albergotti, <HI>being encouraged by the Presence of so great an Army, will make an extra∣ordinary Defence.</HI> Why then I find, <HI>Albergun</HI> is one of those that love to have a great many on their Side—Nay, I'll say that for this Paper, he makes the most natural Inferences of any of them all. <HI>The Elector of</HI> Bavaria <HI>being uneasy to be without any Command, has desired Leave to come to Court to communicate a certain Project to his Majesty—Whatever it be, it is said, that Prince is suddenly expected, and then we shall have a more certain Account of his Project, if this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>∣port has any Foundation.</HI> Nay, this Paper new imposes upon us, he goes upon sure Grounds; for he won't be positive the Elector has a Project, or that he will come, or if he does come at all; for he doubts, you see, whether the Report has any Foundation.</P>
<P>What makes this the more lamentable is, that this Way of Writing falls in with the Imagina∣tion
<PB N="315" REF="322"/>
of the cooler and duller Part of Her Maje∣sty's Subjects. The being kept up with one Line contradicting another, and the whole, after many Sentences of Conjecture, vanishing in a Doubt whether there is any Thing at all in what the Person has been reading of, puts an ordinary Head into a Vertigo, which his natural Dulness would have secured him from. Next to the La∣bours of the <HI>Post-Man,</HI> the Upholsterer took from under his Elbow honest <HI>Icabod Dawks</HI>'s Letter, and there, among other Speculations, the Histo∣rian takes upon him to say, <HI>That it is discoursed that there will be a Battel in</HI> Flanders <HI>before the Armies separate, and many will have it to be to Morrow, the great Battel of</HI> Ramelies <HI>being fought on a</HI> Whit-Sunday. A Gentleman who was a Wag in this Company laughed at the Expression, and said, By Mr. <HI>Dawks</HI>'s Favour, I warrant ye, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f we meet them on <HI>Whit-Sunday</HI> or <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nday,</HI> we shall not stand upon the Day with them, whether it be before or after the Holidays. An Admirer of this Gentleman stood up, and told a Neighbour at a distant Table the Conceit, at which indeed we were all very merry. These Reflections in the Writers of the Transactions of the Times, seize the Noddles of such as were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ot born to have Thoughts of their own, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>onsequently lay a Weight upon every Thing which they read in Print. But Mr. <HI>Dawks</HI> con∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>luded this Paper with a courteous Sentence, which was very well taken and applauded by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he whole Company. <HI>We wish,</HI> says he, <HI>all our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ustomers a merry</HI> Whitsuntide, <HI>and many of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hem.</HI> Honest <HI>Icabod</HI> is as extraordinary a Man <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s any of our Fraternity, and as particular. His <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tyle is a Dialect between the Familiarity of Talk∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>g and Writing, and his Letter such as you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>annot distinguish whether Print or Manuscript, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hich gives us a Refreshment of the Idea from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat has been told us from the Press by others.

This wishing a good Tide had its Effect upon us<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and he was commended for his Salutation, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> showing as well the Capacity of a Bell-man a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> an Historian. My distempered old Acquaintanc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> read in the next Place the Account of the Affairs abroad in the <HI>Courant;</HI> but the Matter was told so distinctly, that these Wanderers thought there was no News in it; this Paper differing from the rest as an History from a Romance. The Tauto∣logy, the Contradictions, the Doubts, and Wants of Confirmations, are what keep up imaginary Entertainments in empty Heads, and produce Neglect of their own Affairs, Poverty, and Bank∣rupcy, in many of the Shop-Statesmen; but turn the Imaginations of those of a little higher Orb into Deliriums of Dissatisfaction, which is seen in a continual Fret upon all that touches their Brains, but more particularly upon any Ad∣vantage obtained by their Country, where they are considered as Lunaticks, and therefore tole∣rated in their Ravings.</P>
<P>What I am now warning the People of is, That the News-Papers of this Island are as per∣nicious to weak Heads in <HI>England</HI> as ever Books of Chivalry to <HI>Spain;</HI> and therefore shall do all that in me lies, with the utmost Care and Vigi∣lance imaginable, to prevent these growing E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> A framing Instance of this Malady appeared in my old Acquaintance at this Time, who, after he had done reading all his Papers, ended with a Thoughtful Air. <HI>If we should have a Peace, we should then know for certain whether it was the King of</HI> Sweden <HI>that lately came to</HI> Dunkirk I whispered him, and desired him to step aside a little with me.

They told him, One would speak with him be∣low. He came immediately to our Coach-Side. I whispered him, That I had an Order to carry him to the <HI>Bastile.</HI> He immediately obeyed with great Resignation: For to this Sort of Lunatick, whose Brain is touched for the <HI>French,</HI> the Name of a Gaol in that Kingdom has a more agreeable Sound than that of a Paternal Seat in this their own Country. It happen'd a little unluckily bringing these Lunaticks together, for they im∣mediately fell into a Debate concerning the Great∣ness of their respective Monarchs; one for the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> the other for the Grand Mo∣narch of <HI>France.</HI> This Gentleman from <HI>Will</HI>'s is now next Door to the Upholsterer, safe in his Apartment in my <HI>Bedlam,</HI> with proper Medica∣ments, and the <HI>Mercure Gallant</HI> to sooth his Ima∣gination that he is actually in <HI>France.</HI> If there∣fore he should escape to <HI>Covent-Garden</HI> again, all Persons are desired to lay hold of him, and de∣liver him to Mr. <HI>Morphew,</HI> my Overseer.

<P><PB N="319" REF="326"/>
As the Winter ingrosses with us near a dou∣ble Portion of the Year, (the Three delightful Vicissitudes being crowded almost within the Space of Six Months) there is nothing upon which I have bestowed so much Study and Ex∣pence, as in contriving Means to soften the Se∣verity of it, and, if possible, to establish Twelve chearful Months about my Habitation. In order to this, the Charges I have been at in building and furnishing a Green-House, will, perhaps, be thought somewhat extravagant by a great many Gentlemen whose Revenues ex∣ceed mine. But when I consider, that all Men of any Life and Spirit have their Inclinations to gratify, and when I compute the Sums laid out by the Generality of the Men of Pleasure (in the Number of which I always rank my self) in riotous Eating and Drinking, in Equi∣page and Apparel, upon Wenching, Gaming, Racing and Hunting; I find, upon the Bal∣lance, that the indulging of my Humour comes at a reasonable Rate.</P>
<P>Since I communicate to you all Incidents se∣rious and trifling, even to the Death of a But∣terfly, that fall out within the Compass of my little Empire, you will not, I hope, be ill plea∣sed with the Draught I now send you of my little Winter Paradise, and with an Account of my Way of amusing my self and others in it.</P>
<P>The younger <HI>Pliny,</HI> you know, writes a long Letter to his Friend <HI>Gallus,</HI> in which he gives him a very particular Plan of the Situation, the Conveniencies, and the Agreeableness of his Villa. In my last, you may remember, I pro∣mised you something of this Kind. Had <HI>Pliny</HI> lived in a Northern Climate, I doubt not but we should have found a very compleat Oran∣gery amongst his Epistles; and I, probably, should have copied his Model, instead of Build∣ing
<PB N="320" REF="327"/>
after my own Fancy, and you had been re∣ferred to him for the History of my late Ex∣ploits in Architecture: By which Means my Performances would have made a better Figure, at least in Writing, than they are like to make at present.</P>
<P>The Area of my Green-house is a Hundred Paces long, Fifty broad, and the Roof Thirty Foot high. The Wall toward the North is of solid Stone. On the South Side, and at both the Ends, the Stone-work rises but Three Foot from the Ground, excepting the Pilasters, pla∣ced at convenient Distances to strengthen and beautify the Building. The intermediate Spaces are filled up with large Sashes of the strongest and most transparent Glass. The Middle Sash (which is wider than any of the other) serves for the Entrance, to which you mount by Six easy Steps, and descend on the Inside by as many. This opens and shuts with greater Ease, keeps the Wind out better, and is at the same Time more uniform than Folding-Doors.</P>
<P>In the Middle of the Roof there runs a Ciel∣ing Thirty Foot broad from one End to the other. This is enlivened by a Masterly Pencil, with all the Variety of Rural Scenes and Pro∣spects, which he has peopled with the whole Tribe of Silvan Deities. Their Characters and their Stories are so well expressed, that the whole seems a Collection of all the most beau∣tiful Fables of the ancient Poets translated into Colours. The remaining Spaces of the Roof, Ten Foot on each Side of the Cieling, are of the clearest Glass, to let in the Sky and Clouds from above. The Building points full East and <HI>West,</HI> so that I enjoy the Sun while he is about the Horizon. His Rays are improved through the Glass, and I receive through it what is de∣sirable in a Winter-Sky, without the coarse Allay of the Season, which is a Kind of sifting
<PB N="321" REF="328"/>
or straining the Weather. My Greens and Flowers are as sensible as I am of this Benefit: They flourish and look chearful as in the Spring, while their Fellow-Creatures abroad are star∣ved to Death. I must add, that a moderate Expence of Fire, over and above the Contribu∣tions I receive from the Sun, serves to keep this large Room in a due Temperature; it be∣ing sheltered from the cold Winds by a Hill on the North, and a Wood on the East.</P>
<P>The Shell, you see, is both agreeable and con∣venient; and now you shall judge, whether I have laid out the Floor to Advantage. There goes through the whole Length of it a spacious Walk of the finest Gravel, made to bind and unite so firmly, that it seems one continued Stone; with this Advantage, that it is easier to the Foot, and better for walking, than if it were what it seems to be. At each End of the Walk, on the one and on the other Side of it, lies a square Plot of Grass of the finest Turf, and brightest Verdure. What Ground remains on both Sides, between these little smooth Fields of Green, is flagged with large Quarries of white Marble, where the blue Veins trace out such a Variety of irregular Windings thro' the clear Surface, that these bright Plains seem full of Rivulets and Streaming Meanders. This to my Eye, that delights in Simplicity, is inexpressibly more beautiful, than the che∣quered Floors which are so generally admired by others. Upon the Right and upon the Left, along the Gravel Walk, I have ranged inter∣changeably the Bay, the Mirtle, the Orange and the Lemon Trees, intermixed with painted Hollies, Silver Firs, and Pyramids of Yew; all so disposed, that every Tree receives an additio∣nal Beauty from its Situation; besides the Har∣mony that rises from the Disposition of the whole, no Shade cuts too strongly, or breaks in
<PB N="322" REF="329"/>
harshly upon the other; but the Eye is cheare<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> with a mild rather than gorgeous Diversity <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Greens.</P>
<P>The Borders of the Four Grass-Plots are gar¦nished with Pots of Flowers: Those Delicacie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of Nature recreate Two Senses at once, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> leve such delightful and gentle Impression<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> upon the Brain, that I cannot help thinking them of equal Force with the softest Airs o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Musick, toward the smoothing of our Tem∣pers. In the Center of every Plot is a Statue<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> The Figures I have made Choice of are a <HI>Venus,</HI> an <HI>Adonis,</HI> a <HI>Diana,</HI> and an <HI>Apollo;</HI> such excel∣lent Copies, as to raise the same Delight as we should draw from the Sight of the ancient Originals.</P>
<P>The North Wall would have been but a tire∣some Waste to the Eye, if I had not diversified it with the most lively Ornaments, suitable to the Place. To this Intent, I have been at the Expence to lead over Arches from a neighbour∣ing Hill a plentiful Store of Spring-Water, which a beautiful <HI>Naiade,</HI> placed as high as is possible in the Center of the Wall, pours out from an Urn. This, by a Fall of above Twen∣ty Foot, makes a most delightful Cascade into a Basin, that opens wide within the Marble-Floor on that Side. At a reasonable Distance, on either Hand of the Cascade, the Wall is hollowed into Two spreding Scallops, each of which receives a Couch of green Velvet, and forms at the same Time a Canopy over them. Next to them come Two large Aviaries, which are likewise let into the Stone. These are succeeded by Two Grotto's, set off with all the pleasing Rudeness of Shells and Moss, and cragged Stones, imitating in Miniature Rocks and Precipices, the most dreadful and gigantick Works of Nature. After the Grotto's, you have Two Niches, the one inhabited by <HI>Ceres,</HI>
<PB N="323" REF="330"/>
with her Sickle and Sheaf of Wheat; and the other by <HI>Pomona,</HI> who, with a Countenance full of good Cheer, pours a bounteous Autumn of Fruits out of her Horn. Last of all come Two Colonies of Bees, whose Stations lying East and West, the one is saluted by the Ri∣sing, the other by the Setting Sun. These, all of them being placed at proportioned Intervals, furnish out the whole Length of the Wall; and the Spaces that lie between are painted in Fresco, by the same Hand that has enriched my Cieling.</P>
<P>Now, Sir, you see my whole Contrivance to elude the Rigour of the Year, to bring a Nor∣thern Climate nearer the Sun, and to exempt my self from the common Fate of my Coun∣trymen. I must detain you a little longer, to tell you, That I never enter this delicious Re∣tirement, but my Spirits are revived, and a sweet Complacency diffuses it self over my whole Mind. And how can it be otherwise, with a Conscience void of Offence, where the Musick of Falling Waters, the Symphony of Birds, the gentle Humming of Bees, the Breath of Flowers, the fine Imagery of Painting and Sculpture: In a Word, the Beauties and the Charms of Nature and of Art court all my Faculties, refresh the Fibres of the Brain, and smooth every Avenue of Thought. What plea∣sing Meditations, what agreeable Wanderings of the Mind, and what delicious Slumbers, have I enjoyed here? And when I turn up some Masterly Writer to my Imagination, me∣thinks here his Beauties appear in the most ad∣vantagious Light, and the Rays of his Genius shoot upon me with greater Force and Bright∣ness than ordinary. This Place likewise keeps the whole Family in good Humour, in a Season wherein Gloominess of Temper prevails uni∣versally in this Island. My Wife does often
<PB N="324" REF="331"/>
touch her Lute in one of the Grotto's, and my Daughter sings to it, while the Ladies with you, amidst all the Diversions of the Town, and in the most affluent Fortunes, are fretting and repining beneath a lowering Sky for they know not what. In this Green House we often dine, we drink Tea, we dance Country-Dances; and what is the chief Pleasure of all, we enter∣tain our Neighbours in it, and by this Means contribute very much to mend the Climate Five or Six Miles about us.

<P>I Have received a Letter which accuses me of Partiality in the Administration of the Censorship, and says, That I have been very free with the lower Part of Mankind, but ex∣tremely cautious in Representations of Matters which concern Men of Condition. This Cor∣respondent takes upon him also to say, the Up∣holsterer was not undone by turning Politician, but became Bankrupt by trusting his Goods to Persons of Quality; and demands of me, that I should do Justice upon such as brought Poverty and Distress upon the World below them, while
<PB N="325" REF="332"/>
they themselves were sunk in Pleasures and Luxury, supported at the Expence of those very Persons whom they treated with a Negligence, as if they did not know whether they dealt with them or not. This is a very heavy Accusation, both of me and such as the Man aggrieved ac∣cuses me of tolerating. For this Reason, I re∣solved to take this Matter into Consideration, and upon very little Meditation could call to my Memory many Instances which made this Com∣plaint far from being groundless. The Root of this Evil does not always proceed from Injustice in the Men of Figure, but often from a false Grandeur which they take upon them in being unacquainted with their own Business, not con∣sidering how mean a Part they act when their Names and Characters are subjected to the little Arts of their Servants and Dependants. The Overseers of the Poor are a People who have no great Reputation for the Discharge of their Trust, but are much less scandalous than the Overseers of the Rich. Ask a young Fellow of a great Estate, Who was that odd Fellow spoke to him in a publick Place? He answers, One that does any Business. It is, with many, a natural Conse∣quence of being a Man of Fortune, that they are not to understand the Disposal of it; and they long to come to their Estates, only to put them∣selves under new Guardianship. Nay, I have known a young Fellow who was regularly bred an Attorney, and was a very expert one till he had an Estate fallen to him. The Moment that happened, he who could before prove the next Land he cast his Eye upon his own, and was so sharp, that a Man at first Sight would give him a small Sum for a general Receipt, whether he owed him any Thing or not: Such a one, I say, have I seen, upon coming to an Estate, forget all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Diffidence of Mankind, and become the most manageable Thing breathing.

Nay, at the lower End of the same Table, you may hear a Butcher and Poulterer say, That at their proper Charge, all that Family has been maintained since they last came to Town:</P>
<P>The free Manner in which People of Fashion are discoursed on at such Meetings, is but a just Reproach for their Failures in this Kind; but the melancholy Relations of the great Necessities Tradesmen are driven to, who support their Credit in Spight of the faithless Promises which are made them, and the Abatement which they suffer when paid, by the Extortion of Upper Ser∣vants, is what would stop the most thoughtless Man in the Career of his Pleasures, if rightly re∣presented to him.</P>

<P>THere are those among Mankind, who can enjoy no Relish of their Being, except the World is made acquainted with all that relates

to them, and think every Thing lost that passes un∣observed; but others find a solid Delight in stealing by the Crowd, and modelling their Life after such a Manner, as is as much above the Approbation as the Practice of the Vulgar. Life being too short to give Instances great enough of true Friendship or Good-Will, some Sages have thought it pious to preserve a certain Reverence for the Manes of their deceased Friends, and have withdrawn themselves from the rest of the World at certain Seasons, to commemorate in their own Thoughts such of their Acquaintance who have gone before them out of this Life: And indeed, when we are advanced in Years, there is not a more pleasing Entertainment, than to recollect in a gloomy Moment the many we have parted with that have been dear and agree∣able to us, and to cast a melancholy Thought or Two after those with whom, perhaps, we have indulged our selves in whole Nights of Mirth and Jollity. With such Inclinations in my Heart I went to my Closet yesterday in the Evening and resolved to be sorrowful; upon which Occa∣sion, I could not but look with Disdain upon my self, that though all the Reasons which I had to lament the Loss of many of my Friends are now as forcible as at the Moment of their Departure, yet did not my Heart swell with the same Sor∣row which I felt at that Time; but I could, without Tears, reflect upon many pleasing Ad∣ventures I have had with some who have long been blended with common Earth. Though it is by the Benefit of Nature that Length of Time thus blots out the Violence of Afflictions; yet with Tempers too much given to Pleasure, it is almost necessary to revive the old Places of Grief in our Memory, and ponder Step by Step on past Life, to lead the Mind into that Sobriety of Thought which poises the Heart, and makes it beat with due Time, without being quickened
<PB N="331" REF="338"/>
with Desire, or retarded with Despair, from its proper and equal Motion. When we wind up a Clock that is out of Order, to make it go well for the future, we do not immediately set the Hand to the present Instant, but we make it strike the Round of all its Hours, before it can recover the Regularity of its Time. Such, thought I, shall be my Method this Evening; and since it is that Day of the Year which I dedicate to the Memory of such in another Life as I much delighted in when living, an Hour or Two shall be sacred to Sorrow and their Memory, while I run over all the melancholy Circumstances of this Kind which have occurred to me in my whole Life.</P>
<P>The first Sense of Sorrow I ever knew was upon the Death of my Father, at which Time I was not quite Five Years of Age; but was rather amazed at what all the House meant, than pos∣sessed with a real Understanding why no Body was willing to play with me. I remember I went into the Room where his Body lay, and my Mo∣ther sate weeping alone by it. I had my Battle∣dore in my Hand, and fell a beating the Coffin, and calling Papa; for I know not how I had some slight Idea that he was locked up there. My Mother catched me in her Arms, and trans∣ported beyond all Patience of the silent Grief she was before in, she almost smothered me in her Embrace, and told me in a Flood of Tears, Papa could not hear me, and would play with me no more, for they were going to put him un∣der Ground, whence he could never come to us again. She was a very beautiful Woman, of a noble Spirit, and there was a Dignity in her Grief amidst all the Wildness of her Transport, which, methought, struck me with an Instinct of Sorrow, which, before I was sensible of what it was to grieve, seized my very Soul, and has made Pity the Weakness of my Heart ever since. The Mind in Infancy is, methinks, like the Body
<PB N="332" REF="339"/>
in Embrio, and receives Impressions so forcible, that they are as hard to be removed by Reason, as any Mark with which a Child is born is to be taken away by any future Application. Hence it is, that Good-Nature in me is no Merit; but having been so frequently over-whelmed with her Tears before I knew the Cause of any Af∣fliction, or could draw Defences from my own Judgment, I imbibed Commiseration, Remorse, and an unmanly Gentleness of Mind, which has since insnared me into Ten Thousand Calamities, and from whence I can reap no Advantage, ex∣cept it be, that in such an Humour as I am now in, I can the better indulge my self, in the Soft∣nesses of Humanity, and enjoy that sweet An∣xiety which arises from the Memory of past Af∣flictions.</P>
<P>We that are very old, are better able to re∣member Things which befel us in our distant Youth, than the Passages of later Days. For this Reason it is, that the Companions of my strong and vigorous Years present themselves more im∣mediately to me in this Office of Sorrow. Un∣timely or unhappy Deaths are what we are most apt to lament, so little are we able to make it in∣different when a Thing happens, though we know it must happen. Thus we groan under Life, and bewail those who are relieved from it. Every Object that returns to our Imagination raises different Passions, according to the Circum∣stance of their Departure. Who can have lived in an Army, and in a serious Hour reflect upon the many gay and agreeable Men that might long have flourished in the Arts of Peace, and not join with the Imprecations of the Father∣less and Widow on the Tyrant to whose Ambi∣tion they fell Sacrifices? But gallant Men, who are cut off by the Sword, move rather our Vene∣ration than our Pity, and we gather Relief enough from their own Contempt of Death, to
<PB N="333" REF="340"/>
make it no Evil, which was approached with so much Chearfulness, and attended with so much Honour. But when we turn our Thoughts from the great Parts of Life on such Occasions, and instead of lamenting those who stood ready to give Death to those from whom they had the Fortune to receive it; I say, when we let our Thoughts wander from such noble Objects, and consider the Havock which is made among the Tender and the Innocent, Pity enters with an unmixed Softness, and possesses all our Souls at once.</P>
<P>Here (were there Words to express such Senti∣ments with proper Tenderness) I should record the Beauty, Innocence, and untimely Death, of the first Object my Eyes ever beheld with Love. The beauteous Virgin! How ignorantly did she charm, how carelesly excel? Oh Death! Thou hast Right to the Bold, to the Ambitious, to the High, and to the Haughty; but why this Cruel∣ty to the Humble, to the Meek, to the Un∣discerning, to the Thoughtless? Nor Age, nor Business, nor Distress, can erase the dear Image from my Imagination. In the same Week, I saw her dressed for a Ball, and in a Shrowd. How ill did the Habit of Death become the Prerty Trifler? I still behold the smiling Earth—A large Train of Disasters were coming on to my Memory, when my Servant knocked at my Closer Door, and interrupted me with a Letter, attended with a Hamper of Wine, of the same Sort with that which is to be put to Sale on <HI>Thursday</HI> next at <HI>Garraway</HI>'s Coffee-house. Upon the Receipt of it, I sent for Three of my Friends. We are so intimate, that we can be Company in whatever State of Mind we meet, and can enter∣tain each other without expecting always to re∣joice. The Wine we found to be generous and warming, but with such an Heat as moved us rather to be chearful than frolicksome. It re∣vived
<PB N="334" REF="341"/>
the Spirits without firing the Blood. We commended it till Two of the Clock this Morn∣ing, and having to Day met a little before Din∣ner, we found, that though we drank Two Bottles a Man, we had much more Reason to recollect than forget what had passed the Night before.</P>

<P>THE Town grows so very empty, that the greater Number of my gay Character are fled out of my Sight into the Country. My <HI>Beaus</HI> are now Shepherds, and my <HI>Belles</HI> Wood Nymphs. They are lolling over Rivulets, and covered with Shades, while we who remain in Town hurry through the Dust about Imperti∣nencies, without knowing the Happiness of Lei∣sure and Retirement. To add to this Calamity even the Actors are going to desert us for a Sea∣son, and we shall not shortly have so much as a Landskip or Frost-Scene to refresh our selve within the Midst of our Fatigues. This may not perhaps be so sensible a Loss to any other as to me; for I confess it is one of my greatest De∣lights to sit unobserved and unknown in the Gal∣lery, and entertain my self either with what is personated on the Stage or observe what Ap∣pearances present themselves in the Audience. If there were no other good Consequences in a Playhouse, than that so many Persons of diffe∣rent
<PB N="335" REF="342"/>
Ranks and Conditions are placed there in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>heir most pleasing Aspects, that Prospect only would be very far from being below the Plea∣sures of a wise Man. There is not one Person you can see, in whom, if you look with an In∣clination to be pleased, you may not behold some∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hing worthy or agreeable. Our Thoughts are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n our Features; and the Visage of these in whom Love, Rage, Anger, Jealousy or Envy, have their frequent Mansions, carries the Traces of those Passions wherever the Amorous, the Cholerick, the Jealous, or the Envious, are plea∣ed to make their Appearance. However, the As∣sembly at a Play is usually made up of such as have a Sense of some Elegance in Pleasure, by which Means the Audience is generally composed of those who have gentle Affections, or at least of such as at that Time are in the best Humour you can ever find them. This has insensibly a good Effect upon our Spirits; and the Musical Airs which are play'd to us, put the whole Com∣pany into a Participation of the same Pleasure, and by Consequence for that Time equal in Hu∣nour, in Fortune, and in Quality. Thus far we gain only by coming into an Audience; but if we find added to this, the Beauties of proper Action, the Force of Eloquence, and the Gaiety of well-placed Lights and Scenes, it is being happy, and seeing others happy for Two Hours; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> Duration of Bliss not at all to be slighted by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> short-lived a Creature as Man. Why then <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hould not the Duty of the Player be had in much more Esteem than it is at present? If the Merit of a Performance be to be valued according <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o the Talents which are necessary to it, the Qualifications of a Player should raise him much <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bove the Arts and Ways of Life which we call Mercenary or Mechanick. When we look round <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> full House, and behold so few that can (though <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ey set themselves out to Show as much as the
<PB N="336" REF="343"/>
Persons on the Stage do) come up to what the would appear even in dumb Show, How much does the Actor deserve our Approbation, who adds to the Advantage of Looks and Motions the Tone of Voice, the Dignity, the Humili∣ry, the Sorrow, the Triumph suitable to the Character he personates?</P>
<P>It may possibly be imagined by severe Men, that I am too frequent in the Mention of the Theatrical Representations; But who is not ex∣cessive in the Discourse of what he extremely likes? <HI>Eugenio</HI> can lead you to a Gallery of fine Pictures, which Collection he is always increa∣sing: <HI>Crassus</HI> through Woods and Forrests, to which he designs to add the neighbouring Coun∣ties. These are great and noble Instances of their Magnificence. The Players are my Pi∣ctures, and their Scenes my Territories. By com∣municating the Pleasure I take in them, it may in some Measure add to Men's Gratifications this Way, as viewing the Choice and Wealth of <HI>En∣genio</HI> and <HI>Crassus</HI> augments the Enjoyments of those whom they entertain, with a Prospect of such Possessions as would not otherwise fall with∣in the Reach of their Fortunes.</P>
<P>It is a very good Office one Man does another when he tells him the Manner of his being plea∣sed; and I have often thought, that a Com∣ment upon the Capacities of the Players would very much improve the Delight that Way, and impart it to those who otherwise have no Sense of it.</P>
<P>The First of the present Stage are <HI>Wilks</HI> and <HI>Cibber,</HI> perfect Actors in their different Kinds. <HI>Wilks</HI> has a singular Talent in representing the Graces of Nature, <HI>Cibber</HI> the Deformity in th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Affectation of them. Were I a Writer of Plays<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> I should never employ either of them in Pai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> which had not their Bent this Way. This <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> seen in the immitable Strain and Ruin of go<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>
<PB N="337" REF="344"/>
Humour which is kept up in the Chara∣cter of <HI>Wildair,</HI> and in the nice and delicate Abuse of Understanding in that of <HI>Sir Novel∣ty. Cibber,</HI> in another Light, hits exquisitely the flat Civility of an affected Gentleman-Usher, and <HI>Wilks</HI> the easy Frankness of a Gen∣tleman.</P>
<P>If you would observe the Force of the same Capacities in higher Life, Can any Thing be more ingenuous, than the Behaviour of Prince <HI>Harry</HI> when his Father checks him? Any Thing more exasperating, than that of <HI>Richard,</HI> when he insults his Superiors? To beseech gracefully, to approach respectfully, to pity, to mourn, to love, are the Places wherein <HI>Wilks</HI> may be made to shine with the utmost Beauty: To rally plea∣santly, to scorn artfully, to flatter, to ridicule, and to neglect, are what <HI>Cibber</HI> would perform with no less Excellence.</P>
<P>When Actors are considered with a View to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>heir Talents, it is not only the Pleasure of that Hour of Action which the Spectators gain from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>heir Performance, but the Opposition of Right <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd Wrong on the Stage would have its Force <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Assistance of our Judgments on other Oc∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>asions. I have at present under my Tutelage a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oung Poet, who, I design, shall entertain the Town the ensuing Winter. And as he does me <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Honour to let me see his Comedy as he writes it, I shall endeavour to make the Parts fit <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Genio's of the several Actors, as exactly as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>heir Habits can their Bodies: And because the Two I have mentioned are to perform the prin∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ipal Parts, I have prevailed with the House to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>t the <HI>Careless Husband</HI> be acted on <HI>Tuesday</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ext, that my young Author may have a View <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f a Play which is acted to Perfection, both <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> them and all concerned in it, as being born <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ithin the Walls of the Theatre, and written <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ith an exact Knowledge of the Abilities of the

Performers. Mr. <HI>Wilks</HI> will do his best in this Play, because it is for his own Benefit; and Mr. <HI>Cib∣ber,</HI> because he writ it. Besides which, all the great Beauties we have left in Town, or with∣in Call of it, will be present, because it is the last Play this Season. This Opportunity will, I hope, inflame my Pupil with such gene∣rous Notions from seeing this fair Assembly as will be then present, that his Play may be composed of Sentiments and Characters proper to be presented to such an Audience. His Dra∣ma at present has only the Out-Lines drawn. There are, I find, to be in it all the Reve∣rend Offices of Life, such as Regard to Parents, Husbands, and honourable Lovers, preserved with the utmost Care; and at the same Time that Agreeableness of Behaviour, with the In∣termixture of pleasing Passions as arise from Innocence and Virtue, interspersed in such a Manner, as that to be charming and agreea∣ble shall appear the natural Consequence of be∣ing virtuous. This great End is one of those i propose to do in my Censorship; but if I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>d a thin House, on an Occasion when such a Work is to be promoted, my Pupil shall return to his Commons at <HI>Oxford,</HI> and <HI>Sheer-Lane</HI> and the Theatres be no longer Corre∣spondents.</P>

<P>WHEN Men look into their own Bosoms, and consider the generous Seeds which are there planted, that might, if rightly cultiva∣ted, ennoble their Lives, and make their Virtue venerable to Futurity; How can they, without Tears, reflect on the universal Degeneracy from that publick Spirit, which ought to be the first and principal Motive of all their Actions? In the <HI>Graecian</HI> and <HI>Roman</HI> Nations, they were wise enough to keep up this great Incentive, and it was impossible to be in the Fashion without be∣ing a Patriot. All Gallantry had its first Source from hence; and to want a Warmth for the Pu∣blick Welfare, was a Defect so scandalous, that he who was guilty of it had no Pretence to Ho∣nour or Manhood. What makes the Depravity among us in this Behalf the more vexatious and irksome to reflect upon, is, that the Contempt of Life is carried as far amongst us, as it could be in those memorable People; and we want only a proper Application of the Qualities which are frequent among us to be as worthy as they. There is hardly a Man to be found who will not light upon any Occasion which he thinks may taint his own Honour. Were this Motive as strong in every Thing that regards the Publick, as it is in this our private Case, no Man would
<PB N="340" REF="347"/>
pass his Life away without having distinguished himself by some gallant Instance of his Zeal to∣wards it in the respective Incidents of his Life and Profession. But it is so far otherwise, that there cannot at present be a more ridiculous Ani∣mal than one who seems to regard the Good of others. He in Civil Life whose Thoughts turn upon Schemes which may be of general Benefit, without further Reflection, is call'd a Projector; and the Man whose Mind seems intent upon glo∣rious Atchievements, a Knight Errant. The Ri∣dicule among us runs strong against laudable Actions. Nay, in the ordinary Course of Things and the common Regards of Life, Negligence of the Publick is an Epidemick Vice. The Brewer in his Excise, the Merchant in his Cu∣stoms, and for ought we know the Soldier in his Muster-Rolls, think never the worse of them∣selves for being guilty of their respective Fraud towards the Publick. This Evil is come to such a phantastical Height, that he is a Man of a pub¦lick Spirit, and heroically affected to his Coun¦try, who can go so far as even to turn Usure with all he has in her Funds. There is not a Ci¦tizen in whose Imagination such a one does no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> appear in the same Light of Glory, as <HI>Codr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> Scaevola,</HI> or any other great Name in Old <HI>Rom<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/></HI> Were it not for the Heroes of so much <HI>per Cen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/></HI> as have Regard enough for themselves and the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> Nation to trade with her with their Wealth, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> very Notion of publick Love would long e'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> now have vanished from among us.

Such Inclinatio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>
<PB N="341" REF="348"/>
proceed from the most low and vile Corruption of which the Soul of Man is capable. This ef∣faces not only the Practice, but the very Appro∣bation of Honour and Virtue; and has had such an Effect, that to speak freely, the very Sense of Publick Good has no longer a Part even in our Conversations. Can then the most generous Mo∣tive of Life, the Good of others, be so easily banish'd the Breast of Man? Is it possible to draw all our Passions inward? Shall the boiling Heat of Youth be sunk in Pleasures, the Ambition of Manhood in selfish Intrigues? Shall all that is glorious, all that is worth the Pursuit of great Minds, be so easily rooted out? When the uni∣versal Bent of a People seems diverted from the Sense of their common Good and common Glory, it looks like a Fatality, and Crisis of impending Misfortune.</P>
<P>The generous Nations we just now mentioned understood this so very well, that there was hard∣ly an Oration ever made which did not turn upon this general Sense, That the Love of their Country was the first and most essential Quality in an honest Mind. <HI>Demosthenes,</HI> in a Cause wherein his Fame, Reputation and Fortune, were embarked, puts his All upon this Issue; <HI>Let the Athenians,</HI> says he, <HI>be benevolent to me, as they think I have been zealons for them.</HI> This great and discerning Orator knew there was no∣thing else in Nature could bear him up against his Adversaries, but this one Quality of having shown himself willing or able to serve his Coun∣try. This certainly is the Test of Merit; and the first Foundation for deserving Good Will, is having it your self. The Adversary of this Ora∣tor at that Time was <HI>Aeschines,</HI> a Man of wily Arts and Skill in the World, who could, as Oc¦casion served, fall in with a National Start of Passion, or Sullenness of Humour, (which a whole Nation is sometimes taken with as well as a pri∣vate
<PB N="342" REF="349"/>
Man) and by that Means divert them from their common Sense, into an Aversion for re∣ceiving any Thing in its true Light. But when <HI>Demosthenes</HI> had awaked his Audience with tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> one Hint of judging by the general Tenor of hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Life towards them, his Services bore down hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Opponent before him, who fled to the Covert o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> his mean Arts till some more favourable Occa¦sion should offer, against the superior Merit o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Demosthenes.</HI></P>
<P>It were to be wished, that Love of their Coun¦try were the first Principle of Action in Men o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Business, even for their own Sakes; for whe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the World begins to examine into their Conduct the Generality, who have no Share in, or Hope<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of any Part in Power or Riches, but what is th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Effect of their own Labour or Property, wil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> judge of them by no other Method, than that o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> how profitable their Administration has been <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Whole. They who are out of the Influenc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of Men's Fortune or Favour, will let them stan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> or fall by this one only Rule; and Men who ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> bear being try'd by it, are always Popular i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> their Fall: Those who cannot suffer such a Scru¦tiny, are contemptible in their Advancement.</P>
<P>But I am here running into Shreds of Maxim<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> from reading <HI>Tacitus</HI> this Morning, which ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> driven me from my Recommendation of public<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Spirit, which was the intended Purpose of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Lucubration.

<P>THere are certain Occasions of Life which give propitious Omens of the future good Conduct of it, as well as others which explain our present inward State, according to our Beha∣viour in them. Of the latter Sort are Funerals; of the former, Weddings. The Manner of our Carriage when we lose a Friend, shows very much our Temper, in the Humility of our Words and Actions, and a general Sense of our destitute Condition, which runs through all our Deport∣ment. This gives a solemn Testimony of the ge∣nerous Affection we bore our Friends, when we
<PB N="344" REF="351"/>
seem to disrelish every Thing now we can no more enjoy them, or see them partake in our En∣joyments. It is very proper and humane to put our selves as it were in their Livery after their Decease, and wear a Habit unsuitable to Prosperity, while those we loved and honoured are mouldring in the Grave. As this is laudable on the sorrowful Side; so on the other, Incidents of Success may no less justly be represented and acknowledged in our outward Figure and Carriage. Of all such Occasions, that great Change of a Single Life into Marriage is the most important, as it is the Source of all Relations, and from whence all other Friendship and Commerce do principally arise. The general Intent of both Sexes is to dis∣pose of themselves happily and honourably in this State; and as all the good Qualities we have are exerted to make our Way into it, so the best Ap∣pearance, with Regard to their Minds, their Per∣sons, and their Fortunes, at the first Entrance in∣to it, is a Due to each other in the married Pair, as well as a Compliment to the rest of the World. It was an Instruction of a wise Law-giver. That unmarried Women should wear such loose Habits, which, in the flowing of their Garb, should incite their Beholders to a Desire of their Persons; and that the ordinary Motion of their Bodies might display the Figure and Shape of their Limbs in such a Manner, as at once to preserve the strictest Decency, and raise the warmest Inclina∣tions.</P>
<P>This was the Oeconomy of the Legislator for the Increase of People, and at the same Time for the Preservation of the Genial Bed. She who was the Admiration of all who beheld her while unmarried, was to bid adieu to the Pleasure of shining in the Eyes of many, as soon as she took upon her the wedded Condition. However, there was a Festival of Life allowed the New∣married, a Sort of intermediate State between
<PB N="345" REF="352"/>
Celibacy and Matrimony, which continued cer∣tain Days. During that Time, Entertainments, Equipages, and other Circumstances of Rejoi∣cing, were encouraged, and they were permitted to exceed the common Mode of Living, that the Bride and Bridegroom might learn from such Free∣doms of Conversation to run into a general Con∣duct to each other, made out of their past and future State, so to temper the Cares of the Man and the Wife with the Gieties of the Lover and Mistress.</P>
<P>In those wise Ages the Dignity of Life was kept up, and on the Celebration of such Solem∣nities there were no impertinent Whispers and senseless Interpretations put upon the unaffected Chearfulness or accidental Seriousness of the Bride; but Men turn'd their Thoughts upon the general Reflections, upon what Issue might probably be expected from such a Couple in the succeeding Course of their Life, and felicitated them accor∣dingly upon such Prospects.</P>
<P>I must confess, I cannot from any ancient Ma∣nuscripts, Sculptures, or Medals, deduce the Rise of our celebrated Custom of throwing the Stock∣ing; but have a faint Memory of an Account a Friend gave me of an original Picture in the Pa∣lace of <HI>Aldobrandini</HI> in <HI>Rome.</HI> This seems to show a Sense of this Affair very different from what is usual among us. It is a <HI>Grecian</HI> Wed∣ding, and the Figures represented are, a Person offering Sacrifice, a beautiful Damsel dancing, and another playing on the Harp. The Bride is placed in her Bed, the Bridegroom sits at the Feet of it, with an Aspect which intimates, his Thoughts were not only entertained with the Joys with which he was surrounded, but also with a noble Gratitude, and Divine Pleasure in the Offering, which was then made to the Gods to invoke their influence on his new Condition. There appears in the Face of the Woman a Mixture of Fear,
<PB N="346" REF="353"/>
Hope, and Modesty; in the Bridegroom, a well∣governed Rapture. As you see in great Spirits, Grief which discovers it self the more by for∣bearing Tears and Complaints, you may observe also the highest Joy is too big for Utterance, the Tongue being of all the Organs the least capable of expressing such a Circumstance. The Nuptial Torch, the Bower, the Marriage Song, are all Particulars which we meet with in the Allusions of the ancient Writers; and in every one of them something is to be observed, which denotes their Industry to aggrandize and adorn this Occasion above all others.</P>
<P>With us all Order and Decency in this Point is perverted, by the insipid Mirth of certain Ani∣mals we usually call Wags. These are a Species of all Men the most insupportable. One can∣not without some Reflection say, whether their flat Mirth provokes us more to Pity or to Scorn; but if one considers with how great Affectation they utter their frigid Conceits, Commiseration imme∣diately changes it self into Contempt.</P>
<P>A Wag is the last Order even of Pretenders to Wit and good Humour. He has generally his Mind prepared to receive some Occasion of Mer∣riment, but is of himself too empty to draw any out of his own Set of Thoughts, and therefor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> laughs at the next Thing he meets, not because i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> is ridiculous, but because he is under a Necessit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of Laughing. A Wag is one that never in its Lif<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> saw a beautiful Object, but sees, what it does see<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in the most low and most inconsiderable Light <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> can be placed. There is a certain Ability nece<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦sary to behold what is amiable and worthy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> our Approbation, which little Minds want, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> attempt to hide by a general Disregard to ever<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Thing they behold above what they are able <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> relish. Hence it is, that a Wag in an Assembl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> is ever guessing, how well such a Lady slept la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> Night, and how much such a young Fellow
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <PB N="347" REF="354"/>
pleas'd with himself. The Wag's Gaiety consists in a certain professed ill Breeding, as if it were an Excuse for committing a Fault, that a Man knows he does so. Tho' all publick Places are full of Persons of this Order, yet, because I will not allow Impertinence and Affectation to get the better of native Innocence and Simplicity of Man∣ners, I have, in Spite of such little Disturbers of publick Entertainments, perswaded my Brother <HI>Tranquillus</HI> and his Wife my Sister <HI>Jenny,</HI> in Fa∣vour of Mr. <HI>Wilks,</HI> to be at the Play to Morrow Evening.</P>
<P>They, as they have so much good Sense as to act naturally, without Regard to the Observation of others, will not, I hope, be discomposed if any of the Fry of Wags should take upon them to make themselves merry upon the Occasion of their coming, as they intend, in their Wedding Clothes. My Brother is a plain, worthy, and honest Man, and as it is natural for Men of that Turn to be mightily taken with sprightly and airy Women, my Sister has a Vivacity which may perhaps give Hopes to Impertinents, but will be esteemed the Effect of Innocence among wife Men. They design to sit with me in the Box, which the House have been so complaisant to offer me whenever I think fit to come thither in my publick Character.</P>
<P>I do not in the least doubt, but the true Figure of Conjugal Affection will appear in their Looks and Gestures. My Sister does not affect to be gor∣geous in her Dress, and thinks the Happiness of a Wife is more visible in a chearful Look than a gay Apparel. It is a hard Task to speak of Per∣sons so nearly related to one with Decency, but I may say, all who shall be at the Play will allow him to have the Mien of a worthy <HI>English</HI> Gen∣tleman; her, that of a notable and deserving Wife.</P>

<P>SInce you have so often declared your self a Patron of the Distressed, I must acquaint you, that I am Daughter to a Country Gentle∣man of good Sense, and may expect 3 or 4000 <HI>l</HI> for my Fortune. I love and am beloved by <HI>Phi¦lander,</HI> a young Gentleman who has an Estate of 500 <HI>l. per Annum,</HI> and is our near Neighbour in the Country every Summer. My Father<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> though he has been a long Time acquainted with it, constantly refuses to comply with ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> mutual Inclinations: But what most of all tor¦ments me, is, That if ever I speak in Commen¦dation of my Lover, he is much louder in hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Praises than my self; and professes, that 'tis ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of pure Love and Esteem for <HI>Philander,</HI> as wel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> as his Daughter, that he can never consent w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

<P>There is no Calamity in Life that falls heavier upon humane Nature than a Disappointment in Love, especially when it happens between Two Persons whose Hearts are mutually engaged to each other. It is this Distress which has given Occasion to some of the finest Tragedies that were ever written, and daily fills the World with Me∣lancholy, Discontent, Phrensy, Sickness, Despair, and Death. I have often admired at the Barba∣rity of Parents, who so frequently interpose their Authority in this grand Article of Life. I would fain ask <HI>Silvia</HI>'s Father, Whether he thinks he can bestow a greater Favour on his Daughter, than to put her in a Way to live happily? Whe∣ther a Man of <HI>Philander</HI>'s Character, with 500<HI>l. per Annum,</HI> is not more likely to contribute to that End, than many a young Fellow whom he may have in his Thoughts with so many Thou∣sands? Whether he can make Amends to his Daughter by any Increase of Riches, for the Loss
<PB N="350" REF="357"/>
of that Happiness she proposes to her self in her <HI>Philander?</HI> Or whether a Father should com∣pound with his Daughter to be miserable, though she were to get 20000 <HI>l.</HI> by the Bargain: I sup∣pose he would have her reflect with Esteem on his Memory after his Death: And does he think this a proper Method to make her do so, when, as of∣ten as she thinks on the Loss of her <HI>Philander,</HI> she must at the same Time remember him as the cruel Cause of it? Any transientill Humour is soon forgotten; but the Reflection of such a Cruelty must continue to raise Resentments as long as Life it self; and by this one Piece of Barbarity, an indulgent Father loses the Merit of all his past Kindnesses. It is not impossible but she may de∣ceive her self in the Happiness which she propo∣ses from <HI>Philander;</HI> but as in such a Case she can have no one to blame but her self, she will bear the Disappointment with greater Patience; but if she never makes the Experiment, however happy she may be with another, she will still think she might have been happier with <HI>Philan∣der.</HI> There is a kind of Sympathy in Souls that fits them for each other; and we may be assured, when we see Two Personsengaged in the Warmths of a mutual Affectation, that there are certain Qua∣lities in both their Minds which bear a Resem∣blance to one another. A generous and constant Passion in an agreeable Lover, where there is not too great a Disparity in other Circumstances, is the greatest Blessing that can befal the Person be∣loved; and if overlooked in one, may perhaps never be found in another. I shall conclude this with a celebrated Instance of a Father's Indul∣gence in this Particular, which, though carried to an Extravagance, has something in it so tender and amiable, as may justly reproach the Hardness of Temper that is to be met with in many a <HI>Bri∣tish</HI> Father.</P>
<P><PB N="351" REF="358"/>
<HI>Antiochus,</HI> a Prince of great Hopes, fell passio∣nately in Love with the young Queen <HI>Stratonice,</HI> who was his Mother-in-Law, and had bore a Son to the old King <HI>Seleucus</HI> his Father. The Prince finding it impossible to extinguish his Passion, fell sick, and refused all manner of Nourishment, be∣ing determined to put an End to that Life which was become insupportable.</P>
<P><HI>Erasistratus</HI> the Physician soon found that Love was his Distemper; and observing the Alteration in his Pulse and Countenance whenever <HI>Stratonice</HI> made him a Visit, was soon satisfied that he was dying for his young Mother-in-Law. Knowing the old King's Tenderness for his Son, when he one Morning enquired of his Health, he told him, That the Prince's Distemper was Love; but that it was incurable, because it was impossible for him to possess the Person whom he loved. The King, surprised at this Account, desired to know how his Son's Passion could be incurable? Why Sir, replied <HI>Erasistratus,</HI> because he is in Love with the Person I am married to.</P>
<P>The old King immediately conjured him by all his past Favours to save the Life of his Son and Successor. Sir, said <HI>Erasistratus,</HI> Would your Ma∣jesty but fancy your self in my Place, you would see the Unreasonableness of what you desire? Hea∣ven is my Witness, said <HI>Seleucus,</HI> I could resign even my <HI>Stratonice</HI> to save my <HI>Antiochus.</HI> At this the Tears ran down his Cheeks, which when the Physician saw, taking him by the Hand, Sir, says he, If these are your real Sentiments, the Prince's Life is out of Danger; it is <HI>Stratonice</HI> for whom he dies. <HI>Seleucus</HI> immediately gave Orders for fo∣lemnizing the Marriage; and the young Queen, to show her Obedience, very generously exchan∣ged the Father for the Son.</P>

<P>AS it has been the Endeavour of these our Labours to extirpate from among the polite or busy Part of Mankind, all such as are either prejudicial or insignificant to Society; so it ought to be no less our Study to supply the Havock we have made by an exact Care of the growing Ge∣neration. But when we begin to inculcate pro∣per Precepts to the Children of this Island, except we could take them out of their Nurses Arms, we see an Amendment is almost impracticable; for we find the whole Species of our Youth and grown Men is incorrigibly prepossessed with Va∣nity, Pride, or Ambition, according to the re∣spective Pursuits to which they turn themselves: By which Means the World is infatuated with the Love of Appearance instead of Things. Thus the vain Man takes Praise for Honour, the proud Man Ceremony for Respect, the ambitious Man Power for Glory. These three Characters are in∣deed of very near Resemblance, but differently received by Mankind. Vanity makes Men ridi∣culous; Pride, odious; and Ambition, terrible. The Foundation of all which is, That they are grounded upon Falshood: For if Men, instead of studying to appear considerable, were in their own Hearts Possessors of the Requisites for Esteem, the Acceptance they otherwise unfortunately aim at would be as inseparable from them, as Appro∣bation
<PB N="353" REF="360"/>
is from Truth it self. By this Means they would have some Rule to walk by; and they may ever be assured, that a good Cause of Action will certainly receive a suitable Effect. It may be an useful Hint in such Cases for a Man to ask of himself, Whether he really is what he has a Mind to be thought? If he is, he need not give himself much further Anxiety. What will the World say? is the common Question in Matters of Dif∣ficulty; as if the Terror lay wholly in the Sense which others, and not we our selves, shall have of our Actions. From this one Source arise all the Impostors in every Art and Profession, in all Pla∣ces, among all Persons in Conversation, as well as in Business. Hence it is, that a vain Fellow takes twice as much Pains to be ridiculous, as would make him sincerely agreeable.</P>
<P>Can any one be better fashioned, better bred, or has any one more good Nature, than <HI>Damasip∣pus?</HI> But the whole Scope of his Looks and Acti∣ons tends so immediately to gain the good Opi∣nion of all he converses with, that he loses it for that only Reason. As it is the Nature of Vanity to impose false Shews for Truths, so does it also turn Real Possessions into Imaginary Ones. <HI>Da∣masippus,</HI> by assuming to himself what he has not, robs himself of what he has.</P>
<P>There is nothing more necessary to establish Reputation, than to suspend the Enjoyment of it. He that cannot bear the Sense of Merit with Si∣lence, must of Necessity destroy it: For Fame being the general Mistress of Mankind, whoever gives it to himself, insults all to whom he relates any Circumstances to his own Advantage. He is considered as an open Ravisher of that Beauty, for whom all others pine in Silence. But some Minds are so incapable of any Temperance in this Particular, that on every Second in their Dis∣course you may observe an Earnestness in their Eyes, which shows they wait for your Approba∣tion,
<PB N="354" REF="361"/>
and perhaps the next Instant cast an Eye on a Glass to see how they like themselves. Walk∣ing the other Day in a neighbouring Inn of Court, I saw a more happy and more graceful Orator than I ever before had heard, or read of. A Youth, of about Nineteen Years of Age, was in an <HI>In∣dian</HI> Night-Gown and Laced-Cap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> pleading a Cause before a Glass: The young Fellow had a very good Air, and seemed to hold his Brief in his Hand rather to help his Action, than that he wanted Notes for his further Information. When I first began to observe him, I feared he would soon be alarmed; but he was so zealous for his Client, and so favourably received by the Court, that he went on with great Fluency to inform the Bench, That he humbly hoped they would not let the Merit of the Cause suffer by the Youth and Inexperience of the Pleader; that in all Things he submitted to their Candour; and modestly desi∣red they would not conclude, but that Strength of Argument and Force of Reason may be con∣sistent with Grace of Action and Comeliness of Person.</P>
<P>To me, who see People every Day in the midst of Crowds (whomsoever they seem to address to) talk only to themselves and of themselves, this Orator was not so extravagant a Man as perhaps another would have thought him; but I took Part in his Success, and was very glad to find he had in his Favour Judgment and Costs without any Manner of Opposition.</P>
<P>The Effects of Pride and Vanity are of Conse∣quence only to the Proud and the Vain, and tend to no further Ill than what is Personal to them∣selves, in preventing their Progress in any Thing that is worthy and laudable, and creating Envy instead of Emulation of superior Virtue. These ill Qualities are to be found only in such as have so little Minds, as to circumscribe their Thoughts and Designs within what properly relates to the
<PB N="355" REF="362"/>
Value which they think due to their dear and amiable selves: But Ambition, which is the Third great Impediment to Honour and Virtue, is a Fault of such as think themselves born for moving in an higher Orb, and prefer being Powerful and Mischievous to being Virtuous and Obscure. The Parent of this Mischief in Life, so far as to regu∣late it into Schemes, and make it possess a Man's whole Heart, without his believing himself a Dae∣mon, was <HI>Machiavil.</HI> He first taught, That a Man must necessarily appear weak to be honest. Hence it gains upon the Imagination, that a great is not so despicable as a little Villain; and Men are in∣sensibly led to a Belief, that the Aggravation of Crimes is the Diminution of them. Hence the Impiety of thinking one Thing and speaking ano∣ther. In Pursuance of this empty and unsatisfy∣ing Dream, to betray, to undermine, to kill in themselves all natural Sentiments of Love to Friends or Country, is the willing Practice of such as are thirsty of Power, for any other Reason than that of being useful and acceptable to Mankind.</P>

<HEAD><HI>Pasquin</HI> of <HI>Rome</HI> to <HI>Isaac Bickerstaff</HI> of <HI>London.</HI></HEAD>
<P>HIS Holiness is gone to <HI>Castel Gandolpho,</HI> much discomposed at some late Accounts from the Missionaries in your Island: For a Com∣mittee of Cardinals, which lately sat for the re∣viving the Force of some obsolete Doctrines, and drawing up Amendments to certain Points of Faith, have represented the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> to be in great Danger, from a Treatise written by a learned <HI>Englishman,</HI> which carries Spiritual Power much higher than we could have dared to have attempted even here. His Book is cal∣led, <HI>An Epistolary Discourse, proving from the Scriptures and the First Fathers, That the Soul <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a Principle naturally Mortal: Wherein is proved, That none have the Power of giving this Divine immortalizing Spirit since the Apostles, but the Bishops. By</HI> Henry Dodwell, <HI>A. M.</HI> The Affec∣tion appeared to our <HI>Literati</HI> so short and ef∣fectual a Method of subjecting the Laiety, that it is feared Auricular Confession and Absolution will not be capable of keeping the Clergy of <HI>Rome</HI> in any Degree of Greatness, in Compe∣tition with such Teachers whose Flocks shall
<PB N="357" REF="364"/>
receive this Opinion. What gives the greater Jealousy here is, that in the Catalogue of Trea∣tises which have been lately burnt within the <HI>British</HI> Territories, there is no Mention made of this learned Work; which Circumstance is a sort of Implication, that the Tenet is not held Erroneous, but that the Doctrine is received amongst you as Orthodox. The Youth of this Place are very much divided in Opinion, Whe∣ther a very memorable Quotation which the Author repeats out of <HI>Tertullian,</HI> be not rather of the Style and Manner of <HI>Meursius? In illo ipso Voluptatis ultimae aestu quo genitale Virus expelli∣tur, Nonne aliquid de Anima quo{que} sentimus exire, at{que} adeo marcessimus &amp; devigescimus cum Luic Detrimento?</HI> This Piece of <HI>Latin</HI> goes no further than to tells us how our Fathers got us, so that we are still at a Loss how we after∣wards commence eternal; for <HI>Creando infundi∣tur, &amp; infundendo creatur,</HI> which is mentio∣ned soon after, may allude only to Flesh and Blood as well as the former. Your Readers in this City, some of whom have very much approved the Warmth with which you have at∣tacked Free-Thinkers, Atheists, and other Ene∣mies to Religion and Virtue, are very much disturbed that you have given them no Account of this remarkable Dissertation: And I am em∣ployed by them to desire you would with all possible Expedition send me over the Ceremony of the Creation of Souls, as well as a List of all the Mortal and Immortal Men within the Do∣minions of <HI>Great Britain.</HI> When you have done me this Favour, I must trouble you for other Tokens of your Kindness, and particu∣larly I desire you would let me have the Reli∣gious Handkerchief, which is of late so much worn in <HI>England,</HI> for I have promised to make a Present of it to a Courtesan of a <HI>French</HI> Mi∣nister.</P>
<P><PB N="358" REF="365"/>
Letters from the Frontiers of <HI>France</HI> inform us, That a young Gentleman who was to have been created a Cardinal on the next Promo∣tion, has put off his Design of coming to <HI>Rome</HI> so soon as was intended, having, as it is said, received Letters from <HI>Great Britain,</HI> wherein several Vertuosi of that Island have desired him to suspend his Resolutions towards a Monastick Life, till the <HI>British</HI> Grammarians shall publish their Explication of the Words <HI>Indefeazible</HI> and <HI>Revolution.</HI> According as these Two hard Terms are made to fit the Mouths of the People, this Gentleman takes his Measures for his Journey hither.</P>
<P>Your <HI>New Bedlam</HI> has been read and consi∣dered by some of your Countrymen among us; and one Gentleman, who is now here as a Tra∣veller, says, your Design is impracticable, for that there can be no Place large enough to con∣tain the Number of your Lunaticks. He advi∣ses you therefore to name the Ambient Sea for the Boundary of your Hospital. If what he says be true, I do not see how you can think of any other Enclosure; for according to his Dis∣course, the whole People are taken with a Ver∣tigo; great and popular Actions are received with Coldness and Discontent; ill News hoped for with Impatience; Heroes in your Service are treated with Calumny, while Criminals pass through your Towns with Acclamations.</P>
<P>This <HI>Englishman</HI> went on to say, you seemed<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> at present to flag under a Satiety of Success, is if you wanted Misfortune as a necessary Vicissi∣tude. Yet, alas! though Men have but a cold Relish of Prosperity, quick is the Anguish o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the contrary Fortune. He proceeded to make Comparisons of Times, Seasons, and great In¦cidents. After which he grew too learned <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> my Understanding, and talked of <HI>Hanno</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Carthaginian,</HI> and his irreconcilable Hatred <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>

the glorious Commander <HI>Hannibal. Hannibal,</HI> said he, was able to march to <HI>Rome</HI> it self, and brought that ambitious People, which designed no less than the Empire of the World, to sue for Peace in the most abject and servile Manner; when Faction at Home detracted from the Glory of his Actions, and after many Artifices, at last prevailed with the Senate to recall him from the midst of his Victories, and in the very In∣stant when he was to reap the Benefit of all his Toils, by reducing the then common Enemy of all Nations which had Liberty to Reason. When <HI>Hannibal</HI> heard the Message of the <HI>Car∣thaginian</HI> Senators who were sent to recall him, he was moved with a generous and disdainful Sorrow, and is reported to have said, <HI>Hannibal then must be conquered not by the Arms of the</HI> Romans, <HI>whom he has often put to Flight, but by the Envy and Detraction of his Countrymen. Nor shall</HI> Scipio <HI>triumph so much in his Fall as</HI> Hanno, <HI>who will smile to have purchased the Ruin of</HI> Hannibal, <HI>though attended with the Fall of</HI> Carthage.</P>

are a Thousand Thousand like the above-men∣tioned Yeoman and his Wife, who are never high∣ly pleased or distasted in their whole Lives: But when we consider the more informed Part of Mankind, and look upon their Behaviour, it then appears that very little of their Time is indiffe∣rent, but generally spent in the most anxious Vexation, or the highest Satisfaction. <HI>Shakespear</HI> has admirably represented both the Aspects of this State in the most excellent Tragedy of <HI>Othello.</HI> In the Character of <HI>Desdemona,</HI> he runs through all the Sentiments of a virtuous Maid, and a tender Wife. She is captivated by his Virtue, and faith∣ful to him, as well from that Motive, as Regard to her own Honour. <HI>Othello</HI> is a great and noble Spirit, misled by the Villany of a false Friend to suspect her Innocence, and resents it accordingly.

<P>This Opinion of him is so just, that his noble and tender Heart beats it self to Pieces before he can affront her with the Mention of his Jealousy; and owns, this Suspicion has blotted out all the Sense of Glory and Happiness which before it was possessed with, when he laments himself in the warm Allusions of a Mind accustomed to Enter∣tainments so very different from the Pangs of Jea∣lousy and Revenge.

<P>HAving lately turned my Thoughts upon the Consideration of the Behaviour of Parents to Children in the great Affair of Marriage, I took much Delight in turning over a Bundle of Let∣ters which a Gentleman's Steward in the Country had sent me some Time ago. This Parcel is a Collection of Letters written by the Children of the Family (to which he belongs) to their Fa∣ther, and contain all the little Passages of their Lives, and the new Idea's they received as their Years advanced. There is in them an Account of their Diversions as well as their Exercises; and what I thought very remarkable, is, That Two Sons of the Family, who now make considerable Figures in the World, gave Omens of that Sort of Character which they now bear, in the first Ru∣diments of Thought which they show in their
<PB N="366" REF="373"/>
Letters. Were one to point out a Method of Edu∣cation, one could not, methinks, frame one more pleasing or improving than this; where the Children get an Habit of communicating their Thoughts and Inclinations to their best Friend with so much Freedom, that he can form Schemes for their future Life and Conduct from an Ob∣servation of their Tempers, and by that Means be early enough in chusing their Way of Life, to make them forward in some Art or Science at an Age when others have not determined what Pro∣fession to follow. As to the Persons concerned in this Packet I am speaking of, they have given great Proofs of the Force of this Conduct of their Fa∣ther in the Effect it has had upon their Lives and Manners. The elder, who is a Scholar, showed from his Infancy a Propensity to polite Studies, and has made a suitable Progress in Literature; but his Learning is so well woven into his Mind, that from the Impressions of it, he seems rather to have contracted an Habit of Life, than Manner of Discourse. To his Books he seems to owe a good Oeconomy in his Affairs, and a Compla∣cency in his Manners, though in others that Way of Education has commonly a quite different Ef∣fect. The Epistles of the other Son are full of Accounts of what he thought most remarkable in his Reading. He sends his Father for News the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ast noble Story he had read. I observe, he is particularly touched with the Conduct of <HI>Codrus,</HI> who plotted his own Death, because the Oracle had said, If he were not killed, the Enemy should prevail over his Country. Many other Incidents in his little Letters give Omens of a Soul capable of generous Undertakings; and what makes it the more particular, is, That this Gentleman had, in the present War, the Honour and Happiness of doing an Action for which only it was worth coming into the World. Their Father is the most intimate Friend they have, and they always con∣sult
<PB N="367" REF="374"/>
him rather than any other, when any Error has happened in their Conduct through Youth and Inadvertency. The Behaviour of this Gentle∣man to his Sons, has made his Life pass away with the Pleasures of a second Youth; for as the Vexations which Men receive from their Children hasten the Approach of Age, and double the Force of Years; so the Comforts which they reap from them, are Balm to all other Sorrows, and disap∣point the Injuries of Time. Parents of Children repeat their Lives in their Offspring, and their Concern for them is so near, that they feel all their Sufferings and Enjoyments as much as if they re∣garded their own proper Persons. But it is gene∣rally so far otherwise, that the common Race of 'Squires in this Kingdom use their Sons as Per∣sons that are waiting only for their Funerals, and Spies upon their Health and Happiness; as in∣deed they are by their own making them such. In Cases where a Man takes the Liberty after this Manner to reprehend others, it is commonly said, Let him look at Home. I am sorry to own it; but there is one Branch of the House of the <HI>Bicker∣staffs,</HI> who have been as erroneous in their Con∣duct this Way as any other Family whatsoever. The Head of this Branch is now in Town, and has brought up with him his Son and Daughter (who are all the Children he has) in order to be put some Way into the World, and see Fashions. They are both very ill-bred Cubs, and having li∣ved together from their Infancy without Know∣ledge of the Distinctions and Decencies that are proper to be paid to each other's Sex, they squab∣ble like two Brothers. The Father is one of those who knows no better than that all Pleasure is De∣bauchery, and imagines, when he sees a Man become his Estate, that he will certainly spend it. This Branch are a People who never had among them one Man eminent either for Good or Ill; however, have all along kept their Heads just
<PB N="368" REF="375"/>
above Water, not by a prudent and regular Oeco∣nomy, but by Expedients in the Matches they have made into their House. When one of the Family has, in the Pursuit of Foxes, and in the Entertainment of Clowns, ran out the Third Part of the Value of his Estate, such a Spendthrist has dressed up his eldest Son, and married what they call a Good Fortune, who has supported the Fa∣ther as a Tyrant over them, during his Life, in the same House or Neighbourhood. The Son in Succession has just taken the same Method to keep up his Dignity, till the Mortgages he has eat and drank himself into, have reduced him to the Ne∣cessity of sacrificing his Son also, in Imitation of his Progenitor. This had been for many Genera∣tions the whole that had happened in the Family of <HI>Sam. Bickerstaff,</HI> till the Time of my present Cousin <HI>Samuel,</HI> the Father of the young People we have just now spoken of.</P>
<P><HI>Samuel Bickerstaff</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> is so happy, as that by several Legacies from distant Relations, Deaths of Maiden Sisters, and other Instances of good Fortune, he has, besides his real Estate, a great Sum of ready Money. His Son at the same Time knows he has a good Fortune, which the Father cannot alienate, though he strives to make him believe he depends only on his Will for Main∣tenance. <HI>Tom</HI> is now in his Nineteenth Year, Mrs. <HI>Mary</HI> in her Fifteenth. Cousin <HI>Samuel,</HI> who understands no one Point of good Behaviour as it regards all the rest of the World, is an exact Cri∣tick in the Dress, the Motion, the Looks and Gestures of his Children. What adds to their Misery, is, That he is excessively fond of them, and the greatest Part of their Time is spent in the Presence of this nice Observer. Their Life is one continued Constraint. The Girl never turns her Head, but she is warned not to follow the proud Minxes of the Town. The Boy is not to turn Fop, or be quarrelsom; at the same Time not to
<PB N="369" REF="376"/>
take an Affront. I had the good Fortune to dine with him to day, and heard his fatherly Table-Talk as we sat at Dinner, which, if my Memory does not fail me, for the Benefit of the World, I shall set down as he spoke it, which was much as follows, and may be of great Use to those Pa∣rents who seem to make it a Rule, That their Children's Turn to enjoy the World is not to com∣mence, till they themselves have left it.</P>
<Q>Now, <HI>Tom,</HI> I have bought you Chambers in the Inns of Court. I allow you to take a Walk once or twice a Day round the Garden. If you mind your Business, you need not study to be as great a Lawyer as <HI>Cook</HI> upon <HI>Littleton.</HI> I have that that will keep you; but be sure you keep an exact Account of your Linen. Write down what you give out to your Land∣ress, and what she brings Home again. Go as little as possible to t'other End of the Town; but if you do, come Home early. I believe I was as sharp as you for your Ears, and I had my Hat snatched off my Head coming Home late at a Stop by St. <HI>Clement</HI>'s Church, and I don't know from that Day to this who took it. I do not care if you learn to fence a lit∣tle, for I would not have you be made a Fool of. Let me have an Account of every Thing every Post; I am willing to be at that Charge, and I think you need not spare your Pains. As for you, Daughter <HI>Molly,</HI> don't mind one Word that is said to you in <HI>London,</HI> for it is only for your Money.</Q>
