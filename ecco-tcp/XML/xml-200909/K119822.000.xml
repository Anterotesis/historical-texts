<HEAD>THE LEGAL MEANS OF POLITICAL REFORMATION.</HEAD>
<P>NEVER were the baneful effects of <HI>undue influence</HI> more sensibly felt, or more generally acknowledged, than at present.</P>
<P>The <HI>legal</HI> means of curbing this dan∣gerous evil are proposed in two little tracts presented with this paper. The one points out a <HI>legal</HI> mode of obtaining a <HI>more equal representation of the Commons.</HI> The other demonstrates the ancient po∣pular right of holding <HI>new-elected</HI> Parlia∣ments <Q><HI>every year once, and more often if need be.</HI></Q> And the sum of both, jointly considered, may be included in the fol∣lowing short proposition: — that <HI>a more equal representation of the Commons in an∣nual Parliaments (i. e.</HI> ELECTED <Q>eve∣ry year once, and more often if need
<PB N="iv" REF="3"/>be</Q>) <HI>is not only an</HI> ANCIENT, <HI>but even an</HI> INDISPENSABLE, <HI>right of the people.</HI> That this ancient constitution is <HI>indispen∣sable</HI> the many fatal effects of deviating from it have rendered sufficiently obvi∣ous; and therefore no <HI>remedy</HI> can be more efficacious, and constitutionally natural, than a <HI>revival</HI> of that <HI>primitive and fundamental right,</HI> according to the rule of Law, that, <Q><HI>as often as any thing is doubtful or</HI> CORRUPTED, <HI>we should</HI> RECUR <HI>to first principles.</HI></Q> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Loft's</HI> Elements of Law, <HI>N<SUP>o</SUP> 8.</HI></NOTE> And we have no reason to expect that the petition and resolutions of the truly respectable and loyal County of York, (though highly worthy of being adopted by the other counties,) or indeed any other true principles of <HI>Reformation,</HI> will be admit∣ted and rendered effectual by the <HI>Legisla∣ture,</HI> until the several counties themselves shall re-assume this their ancient and constitutional right of being <HI>more equally represented in new annual Parliaments.</HI></P>

<P>MR. PRYNNE informs us, in p. 175, <Q>that in sundry coun∣ties the elections of knights, citizens, and burgesses, were antiently made <HI>all together, in the county-court of the

<P>"I shall begin," (says Mr. Prynne,) <Q>with the indenture for Cumberland and Karlisle, anno 2 Hen. V.</Q> And he cites the form of the indenture at length, but it is not here copied, be∣cause the example is not so full to the point as some others, in pages 176, 177, and 178: <HI>Viz.</HI></P>

<P>"There is the like indenture" (says Mr. Prynne) <Q>for Wiltshire, where the <HI>knights, citizens,</HI> and <HI>burgesses,</HI> are joyntly <HI>elected and retorned together.</HI> An. 2 Hen. V.</Q></P>
<DIV2 TYPE="remarks">
<HEAD>REMARKS, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE circumstances of those antient times are so totally different, in many respects, from the present times, that it is difficult to determine whether any such <HI>joint</HI> elections of knights, citizens,
<PB N="15" REF="13"/>and burgesses, (by the united equal suf∣frages of all the electors together, of e∣very degree, in each county,) can now be made; and, of course, it is doubtful whether such a measure is even advise∣able. Many laws have since been en∣acted respecting elections, all of which must first be well weighed and consi∣dered; for, if any thing therein is in∣compatible with the necessary alterati∣ons, it must be repealed by the same authority which ordained it; because <Q><HI>non est recedendum a forma per statu∣tum prescripta;</HI></Q> and, again, <Q><HI>nil temere novandum est.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Yet, as the injustice and fatal conse∣quences of the present enormous <HI>ine∣quality of representation</HI> in favour of pet∣ty venal boroughs (to the disadvantage of the counties and great cities) is noto∣rious and undeniable, some prudent re∣medy is surely become necessary, and ought to be most earnestly sought after
<PB N="16" REF="14"/>by all lovers of peace and good govern∣ment.</P>
<P>The ruinous effects of a long conti∣nued <HI>parliamentary corruption,</HI> and of its baneful companion, <HI>national repro∣bacy,</HI> (which is the sure harbinger of <HI>pub∣lic misfortune</HI> and <HI>approaching slavery,</HI>) have made such hasty advances of late, that many people begin to be alarmed, and to talk seriously concerning the ne∣cessity of endeavouring to obtain. <Q><HI>a more equal representation of the com∣mons in annual parliaments,</HI> as the true legal means of restoring public credit, and of saving the state.</Q> Such a disposition, towards parliamentary re∣formation, I have perceived in several places, amongst people who have not the least connexion with each other, so that it seems to be the most natural and ob∣vious conclusion of common sense upon the present alarming state of public af∣fairs; and will, probably, (if matters
<PB N="17" REF="15"/>should grow worse,) become more and more general, till the measure be irre∣sistibly demanded by the voice of the people; in which case, all those persons, who have been most concerned in the management of the public treasury, must expect to undergo a severe scrutiny! Or, if any sudden invasion of our natu∣ral enemies should be really intended, (which there is but too much reason to suspect,) the people, it is to be feared, as soon as they are informed of the pub∣lic danger, will be so transported with sudden indignation against particular per∣sons, whose measures may seem to have contributed to the national weakness, that they will not easily be restrained from violent and inconsiderate acts of personal resentment! And it is not at all probable that the people will be tho∣roughly or sufficiently united to act a∣gainst the common enemy, until they have taken such steps as they may think
<PB N="18" REF="16"/>effectual to insure a reformation of go∣vernment, (in case their endeavours a∣gainst the common enemy should prove successful,) and to prevent the like cala∣mities in future.</P>
<P>Those state-ministers, therefore, who shall have sufficient courage to give up, in time, all reliance on <HI>undue parlia∣mentary influence,</HI> and shall prove that their regard for good and <HI>legal govern∣ment</HI> is sincere, by promoting some le∣gal means of restoring to the electors of <HI>counties</HI> and <HI>great cities</HI> their due pro∣portion of <HI>representation</HI> and <HI>consequence in the great national assembly,</HI> those mi∣nisters, I say, howsoever their former measures may have been disliked, will, by such a proof of their <HI>sincerity</HI> in re∣formation, <HI>insure to themselves</HI> the pub∣lic esteem and confidence: for there is a general disposition in Englishmen to overlook all differences of opinion in po∣litics, and to forget all party animosities
<PB N="19" REF="17"/>against those persons, who, by a change of conduct, give proofs of a future re∣gard for popular and constitutional rights. And the almost certain advantages to the crown, by adopting and promoting such a measure, will be <HI>the recovery of a great and extensive empire;</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Memorandum. These Remarks were written in March, 1777. The author had previously informed a nobleman in administration, that the Americans were inclined to a <HI>re-union,</HI> even <HI>under the crown,</HI> on consti∣tutional principles, provided his majesty's ministers could give a <HI>proof of their sincerity</HI> in treating, by adopting some <HI>legal</HI> means of <HI>political reformation</HI> at home, and that the proper constitutional terms, con∣sistent with the natural rights of British subjects, would certainly be <HI>accepted,</HI> if tendered within two or three months; but that no terms short of <HI>independency</HI> would or could be accepted after the expiration of six months from that time. The desire of pointing out such a <HI>plan of reformation,</HI> as might be suitable to the proposed <HI>re∣union,</HI> occasioned these remarks.</NOTE> for no ground of accommodation will be so effectual and certain as such <HI>"a proof of sincerity"</HI> in the sovereign, that he desires to rule his subjects <HI>at home</HI> according to the strictest rule of <HI>legal</HI> and <HI>constitutional princi∣ples,</HI> and is willing to drop all measures
<PB N="20" REF="18"/>or designs which cannot obtain the <HI>un∣influenced assent</HI> of his great national council: and the king's ministers are never answerable for measures, howsoe∣ver unsuccessful, after the same have ob∣tained the sanction of <HI>a free</HI> and <HI>unin∣fluenced</HI> parliament. By such <HI>righte∣ousness</HI> as this <HI>the throne shall be establish∣ed:</HI> whereas an obstinate perseverance and continuance in the contrary mode of administration will, of course, occasion what is vainly called a <HI>state-necessity</HI> for advancing still farther in violent and un∣popular measures; which, like the case of Richard II. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>But the king was not satisfied with these re∣peated declarations: he thought his power and dig∣nity very precarious, while it depended on the <HI>au∣thority of parliament.</HI> He dreaded the popular party, and the effects of opposition and resistance, which he had so lately experienced; and could not bear the restraint, which these apprehensions laid him under. His whole views therefore were from this time directed to one end; <HI>to set himself above all opposition and resistance:</HI> first, by making peace and gaining firm alliance abroad, and then, <HI>by establishing an un∣controllable power at home.</HI> In consequence of this design, he entered with more earnestness upon a treaty of peace with France, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q> See the learned bishop Lowth's Life of William of Wykeham, p. 232. King Richard's obstinate perseverance in such erroneous and dangerous notions produced those very evils of which he was most afraid, <HI>viz.</HI> the loss of <HI>his crown,</HI> his liberty, and his life; for the Machiavelian policy of his ministers, in promoting <HI>parliamentary corruption</HI> and in maintaining a <HI>standing army</HI> of Chesh∣ire time-servers, served only to precipitate the mo∣narch's destruction, and to hasten the revolution.</NOTE> must inevitably end in destruction! No reformation, howe∣ver, can be safely made respecting <HI>a
<PB N="21" REF="19"/>more equal representation of the com∣mons,</HI> until the mode of doing it hath been first adopted and approved by <HI>the majority of the</HI> ELECTORS <HI>themselves in each county;</HI> but, when their consent is once obtained, the ostensible propo∣sers and promoters of the measure will be amply secured from all blame, in case the alteration should not prove effectual; and, on the other hand, they will cer∣tainly enjoy the principal credit of the a∣mendment, in case the measure should be found to answer the desirable purpose.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="20"/>The king might safely signify (in a speech to his parliament or by procla∣mation) his earnest desire to be more accurately informed of the sentiments of his people; and that he therefore wishes to promote, by legal and consti∣tutional means, a <HI>more equal represen∣tation</HI> of all persons who are at present entitled to vote for <HI>knights, citizens,</HI> and <HI>burgesses,</HI> in parliament, that elections may be made in an <HI>equitable and just pro∣portion to the</HI> NUMBERS of those who vote for each denomination, without les∣sening the total number of representa∣tives sent up at present from each coun∣ty; and he might refer the consideration of the most just and unexceptionable means of doing this to the very persons whose rights are concerned, by autho∣rising his sheriffs to summon grand-juries, in their respective counties, to consider and propose the most equitable mode of sending the present number of knights,
<PB N="23" REF="21"/>citizens, and burgesses, for each coun∣ty, in <HI>an equal proportion to the whole number of electors;</HI> and afterwards to submit the result of their consultation to a general-court or assembly of all the electors, in each county, for their assent or amendment; or to a chosen <HI>committee,</HI> appointed by a majority of all the said electors that shall think fit to attend the assembly, agreeably to the first example in the indenture for the county of Kent, wherein the twelve persons named in the indenture, are said to have chosen <HI>(eli∣gerunt)</HI> the <HI>two knights</HI> for the county, and <HI>four citizens</HI> for Canterbury and Ro∣chester: for it is manifest that the twelve persons named acted only in trust, as a <HI>com∣mittee</HI> for the electors of the whole coun∣ty; because the election is expressly decla∣red to have been made <Q>ASSENSU TOTIUS COMITATUS ILLIUS.</Q> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"By the assent of the whole county."</NOTE> And, in the
<PB N="24" REF="22"/>other example for the county of Wilts, wherein only <HI>twenty-six persons,</HI> named in the indenture, are said to have chosen <HI>six∣teen representatives</HI> (viz.two knights, two citizens, and twelve burgesses) <HI>in one joint election;</HI> yet we must not consider the said twenty-six persons as the only electors, but rather as an <HI>acting commit∣tee,</HI> empowered by the whole body of electors in that county; for, though the words <HI>"assensu totius comitatus illius"</HI> are omitted, yet the beginning of the in∣denture expressly informs us that it was made "<HI>in pleno com. Wiltes tento,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"In plain shire" (<HI>or</HI> full county, <HI>meaning</HI> a full county-court) "of Wilts, holden," <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE>" &amp;c. And, likewise, it is not improbable that the said twenty-six electors (who are ex∣pressly named in the indenture with the sheriff, but <HI>"exaltera parte"</HI>) were con∣sidered as the <HI>manucaptors</HI> or <HI>sureties</HI> for the appearance of the <HI>elected;</HI> which will account for their making the indenture
<PB N="25" REF="23"/>with the sheriff; for no <HI>manucaptors</HI> are mentioned <HI>as such</HI> in these inden∣tures, though the appointment and ex∣press mention of <HI>manucaptors</HI> were gene∣rally esteemed a necessary precaution in those ancient times, of which more shall be said hereafter.</P>
<P>The most obvious means of reforma∣tion are either to divide each county into so many equal districts as may most con∣veniently be represented by 2, 3, or 4, de∣puties, so as to include the whole number now sent from each county; or else to <HI>choose the whole number of knights, citizens, and burgesses, by the joint suffrages of all the electors together, at the county-court,</HI> agreeably to the ancient examples already cited. By these regulations, indeed, the borough-voters might complain that they would be injured by losing a large propor∣tion of their borough Representation; that is, they would certainly lose that <HI>unreason∣able proportion</HI> of representation which is
<PB N="26" REF="24"/>injurious to the rights and freedom of their neighbours; but they would be so far from losing any <HI>just and equitable right,</HI> really due to themselves, that they would actually gain thereby <HI>a right</HI> of voting for all the <HI>knights</HI> and <HI>citizens,</HI> as well as for all the <HI>other</HI> deputed <HI>burgesses,</HI> of their respective counties; to which, at present, (as mere burgesses of one borough,) they have no pretence. The experience also of late years has shewn that it is become necessary to enforce the ancient laws, which ordain that <HI>both the electors and the elected</HI> shall be <Q><HI>in eodem comitatu commorantes et residentes.</HI></Q> <NOTE N="(3)" PLACE="foot">"<HI>In the same county dwelling and resident.</HI>" <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>That the knights of the Shires within our kingdom of England, to be chosen to come to the parliaments from henceforth to be hol∣den, should be chosen in every county by men <HI>dwelling and residing in the same County, &amp;c.</HI> And that they, who are to be chosen, be likewise <HI>dwelling and residing in the same Counties,</HI></Q> <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE> <Q>Quod milites Com. infra regnum nostrum Angl. eligend. ad∣veniend. in parl. ex tunc tenend. eligantur in quolibet Com. per homines <HI>in eodem Com. commorantes et residentes, &amp;c.</HI>—Et quod illi, qui eligendi fuerint, sint similiter <HI>in eisdem Com. commorantes et residentes,</HI> &amp;c.</Q> Extract from the copy of a writ, in p. 133 of Prynne's second part of a brief Register, &amp;c. of parl. writs.

<PB N="28" REF="26"/>shameful and unmeaning <HI>secessions</HI> from public business as have lately been made
<PB N="29" REF="27"/>by the gentlemen in opposition to mi∣nistry as well as by many who profess to be the ministers friends. A parliament so far reformed (viz. by having <HI>an equal representation of all the electors in each county</HI>) might be well qualified to con∣sider of some farther regulations to ren∣der the representation of the counties themselves <HI>more equal</HI> and <HI>proportionate, with respect to each other,</HI> according to the number of inhabitants. For, in an∣cient times, ALL MEN, in each county, that were free, howsoever poor, enjoyed a share in the legislature; which may be clearly proved by the very act of parlia∣ment <NOTE N="(5)" PLACE="foot">— 8 Henry VI. cap. vii. Whereby the right of voting was limited <Q>to those who have <HI>land or te∣nement to the value of fourty shillings by the year at the least, &amp;c.</HI></Q> The preamble of this act, however, sufficiently proves the fact, that all the common peo∣ple thought themselves entitled to vote at elections for knights of shires. <Q>Whereas the elections of knights of shires to come to the parliaments of our lord the king, in many counties of the realm of England, have now of late been made by ve∣ry great, <HI>outrageous</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is very easy to give hard epithets, without proofs of their pro∣priety and truth.</NOTE> and excessive number of people dwelling within the same counties, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of the which most part was of people of small substance and of <HI>no value,</HI><NOTE PLACE="foot" N="†">The <HI>value</HI> of our Christian brethren before God, both in church and state, is inestimable! For, all Christians, that are not convicted of crimes, ought surely to be equally esteemed the adopted brethren of Christ, and members of that everlasting building, the church of God, whereby they are entitled to <HI>judge,</HI> not only of things in the present world, but also in that which is to come! For, if they shall hereafter have authority even to "JUDGE ANGELS," <HI>how much more things that pertain to this life?</HI> (1 Cor. vi. 3) For herein con∣sists that NATURAL EQUALITY OF ALL CHRISTIANS, which some political writers aff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ct to deny.</NOTE> whereof every of them pretended a <HI>voice equivalent, as to such elections</HI> to be made with the <HI>most worthy knights and esquires dwelling within the same counties,</HI> whereby manslaughter, riots, batteries, and divisions among the gentlemen and other people of the same counties, <HI>shall very likely rise and be,</HI> unless convenient and due <HI>remedy</HI> be <HI>provided, &amp;c.</HI></Q> But the inconveniences here alledged (for which the iniquitous <HI>remedy</HI> of depriving the common people of their right of voting at county elections was provided) deserve to be no otherwise esteemed than as so many mere imaginary pretences to excuse the <HI>injustice</HI> of the act: for, if any such <HI>man∣slaughter, riots, batteries,</HI> &amp;c. had ever been really oc∣casioned by the former popular elections, the framers of this act would not have failed to cite the examples; for they could not say that any such mischiefs had ever happened (before that time) but only that they <Q><HI>shall very likely rise and be</HI> — unless convenient and due remedy be provided;</Q> whereas, since their iniqui∣tous <HI>remedy</HI> hath taken place, all <HI>these baneful circum∣stances</HI> do notoriously attend it, though the framers of the act could not cite <HI>a single example</HI> of such mischief <HI>before</HI> that unhappy alteration. — It is therefore high time to repeal that act.</NOTE> which unjustly deprived them of that right!</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="28"/>The nation has severely felt the bad effects of that unjust innovation: wit∣ness the present iniquitous practices at
<PB N="31" REF="29"/>contested elections and the helpless and endless manner of adjusting them, be∣sides the ruinous expence of influencing a majority when chosen, (which, at pre∣sent, is considered as a measure of <HI>state necessity,</HI>) and compare these modern corruptions with the happy manner of conducting elections, in general, for near two hundred years before that period, as related by Prynne, in his Brev. Parl. Rediv. p. 137.— <Q>Sundry persons of eminency, quality, parts, and wise∣dom,</Q> (says he,) <Q>in most counties
<PB N="32" REF="30"/>were elected <HI>knights of the shire,</HI> by the unanimous consent of the gentry, freeholders, AND PEOPLE, not only twice or thrice, but 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, times or more, after another, to serve in parliaments, without any e∣mulation, polling, feasting, or can∣vassing, for voyces; or future com∣plaints, contests about their elections, polls, undue or double retorns, which, of late times, have disturbed the coun∣ties peace, and interrupted the par∣liaments proceedings: there being not above two or three cases of elections questioned or complained of from 49 Hen. III. till 22 Edw. IV. for ought (that) appears by the retornes or par∣liament rolls, and <HI>not so much as one double retorn or indenture wherewith all the</HI> LATE <HI>bundles</HI></Q> (Prynne wrote in the reign of king Charles II. and the corruption hath notoriously increased since that time) <Q><HI>of writs are stored, and
<PB N="33" REF="31"/>the House of Commons and late Commit∣tees of privileges pestered, perplexed,</HI> to the great retarding of the more weighty publick affairs of the king and king∣dom.</Q> Let it also be remembered, that, by the before-mentioned unhappy deprivation of the common people's rights, the king has lost the advantage of the proper legal balance against the dan∣gerous power of rich and ambitious men, and overgrown landholders; the fatal want of which has lately been most no∣toriously demonstrated in the unhappy ruined kingdom of Poland; for, as the authority of a king is amply sufficient to defend the common people from the op∣pression of the rich and great, by a due exertion of the laws, provided the com∣mon people be allowed <HI>a due share in the legislature;</HI> so the latter, in return, and for their own sakes, will always be ready to exert their <HI>legislative authority,</HI> as well as their strength and power in <HI>a
<PB N="34" REF="32"/>free militia,</HI><NOTE N="(6)" PLACE="foot">Memorandum. A <HI>militia</HI> cannot be <HI>free,</HI> if the individuals of it are compelled, under the terrors of martial law, to be withdrawn from their families, their ordinary callings, and even from their counties, for six months, or more, without return; for, by these means, they are <HI>withdrawn</HI> also from their <HI>civil capa∣city in the state,</HI> and are apt to become <HI>mere soldiers,</HI> or <HI>mercenaries:</HI> for, when a man loses his trade, or ordi∣nary occupation, together with his family and local connexions, on which his maintenance depends, he may justly be said to lose his <HI>civil capacity;</HI> because he is thereby rendered dependent on his <HI>military sold,</HI> or pay, like the common <HI>soldiers</HI> of all standing armies; and, therefore, whenever the public defence requires the <HI>national militia</HI> to form an army in the field, the service ought to be supplied by a regular military <HI>roster,</HI> or <HI>rotation,</HI> circulating monthly, in due and equal proportions, throughout all the counties: by which means no man would be so long withdrawn from his home as to be injured either in his family or occupa∣tion, and yet the most distant parts of the kingdom would be defended, by the returning disciplined troops; and military vigour would be circulated by the <HI>roster</HI> (like the blood of life) throughout the whole body of the nation, which would give it (under God) such in∣ternal strength as must render all attempts of foreign invaders fatal only to themselves.</NOTE> to maintain the king and the laws, which (by their union with the crown) they will always be able to do whenever the aristocratical power re∣quires any just limitation.</P>

<HEAD>ANNUAL PARLIAMENTS, The ANCIENT and MOST SALUTARY RIGHT OF THE COMMONS of GREAT-BRITAIN.</HEAD>
<P>—THE authority of the <HI>no∣minal</HI> Legislature in 1650 was entirely <HI>il∣legal,</HI> as well as that in 1653, both of them having been set up and maintained by the same unconstitutional arbitrary power; and both of them totally void of the indispensable <HI>Representation</HI> of the people: for though the wretched remains of the Long-Parliament in 1650 (being
<PB N="40" REF="37"/>about 80 Representatives or Members, instead of 513 that had been elected at the beginning of that Parliament) were indeed chosen by a small part of the people of England, yet the legal <HI>Repre∣sentation,</HI> even of that small part, was <HI>out of date</HI> and void, from the length of time that the said Representation had continued <HI>without Re-election,</HI> which was about ten years; whereas it is well known that the due effect, or <HI>virtue,</HI> of popular <HI>Representation,</HI> was formerly supposed to be incapable (like some <HI>an∣nual</HI> fruits) of being so long preserved in useful purity, without a <HI>seasonable re∣newal,</HI> from time to time; so that our more prudent Ancestors (imitating na∣ture) required also an <HI>annual</HI> renewal of their <HI>parliamentary Representation,</HI> as be∣ing necessary for the maintenance of public virtue.</P>
<P>Sir Edw. Coke, in his 4th Inst. p. 9, speaking of "the matters of parliament,"
<PB N="41" REF="38"/>informs us of the reasons usually expres∣sed in the writs for calling a new Parlia∣ment, as <Q>pro quibusdam arduis urgen∣tibus negotiis, nos statum, et defen∣sionem regni nostri Angliae, et Eccle∣siae Anglicanae concernentibus quod∣dam parliamentum nostrum, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> teneri ordinavimus,</Q> <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And he adds, in the next paragraph, <Q>Now, for as much</Q> (says he) <Q>as divers Laws and Statutes have been enacted and provided for these ends aforesaid, and that divers mischiefs in particular, and that divers mischiefs in particular, and divers grievances in general, con∣cerning the honour and safety of the King, the State, and Defence of the Kingdome, and of the Church of Eng∣land, might be prevented, <HI>an excellent Law</HI> was made, anno 36 Edw. III. c. 10. which, <HI>being applied to the said Writs of Parliament,</HI> doth, in a few and ef∣fectual words, set down the true sub∣ject of a Parliament in these words:
<PB N="42" REF="39"/><HI>For the maintenance of the said articles, and statutes, and redress of divers mis∣chiefs and grievances, which daily hap∣pen,</HI> A PARLIAMENT SHALL BE HOL∣DEN EVERY YEAR, as another time was ordained by a statute.</Q> Which Statute, here referred to, was made in the 4th year of the same reign, cap. 14. <Q>Item, it is accorded, that a Parliament shall be holden EVERY YEAR ONCE, <HI>and more often if need be.</HI></Q> But Sir William Blackstone supposes that the King never was <Q>obliged, by these Statutes, to call a <HI>new</HI> Parliament <HI>eve∣ry year;</HI> but only to permit a Parlia∣ment to sit annually for the redress of grievances, and dispatch of business, <HI>if need be.</HI></Q> (1 Com. c. 2, p. 153.)</P>
<P>It is too true, indeed, that our Kings, in general, did not think themselves "<HI>obliged,</HI> by these Statutes," (as they ought in conscience to have been, for the safety of their souls,) <Q>to call a <HI>new
<PB N="43" REF="40"/>Parliament every year:</HI></Q> nay, it is certain that many of them would never have called a Parliament at all, had they not been <HI>"obliged"</HI> by necessity and the circumstances of the times. But by what authority could a representative in one Parliament take his seat in the <HI>next an∣nual Parliament,</HI> without <HI>re-election,</HI> before any laws were made for lengthen∣ing the duration of Parliaments? And besides, if the King did <Q><HI>only permit</HI> a Parliament to sit annually,</Q> <HI>&amp;c.</HI> by what authority could the Parliament be convened at all, under such a circum∣stance, seeing that a <HI>mere permission to sit</HI> excludes the idea of a prorogation from year to year? However, the learned commentator himself very justly observes, in a preceding page, (150,) concerning "the manner and time of assembling," that the <Q>Parliament is regularly to be summoned by the King's <HI>Writ,</HI> or Letter, issued out of Chancery.</Q> And
<PB N="44" REF="41"/>it is well known that these Writs are not addressed to the knights, citizens, and burgesses, elected for any <HI>former</HI> Parlia∣ment, but to <HI>the Sheriffs alone,</HI> to cause <HI>Knights, Citizens, &amp;c. to be elected;</HI> for, when the said Acts were made, such an absurdity in politics had never been con∣ceived in England, as that of trusting the <HI>Representation</HI> of the people, for <HI>a term of years,</HI> (as at present,) to the persons elected! On the contrary, when the business of each Session was finished, the Parliament, of course, was at an end; and therefore Lord Coke did not speak in vain, when he mentioned <HI>"the excellent Law"</HI> (<HI>viz.</HI> the Act for <HI>annual</HI> Parliaments) <Q><HI>being applied to the said Writs of Parliament,</HI></Q> &amp;c. before recited.</P>
<P>A man of so much good sense, learn∣ing, and judgement, as Sir William Blackstone is master of, must be well a∣ware of the pernicious effects of investing
<PB N="45" REF="42"/>the Representatives of the people with a legislative power, beyond the constituti∣onal term of A SINGLE SESSION, without <HI>Re-election;</HI> and therefore I cannot but be surprized at the unguarded manner in which he has expressed himself in his Comment on the two <HI>excellent Statutes</HI> of Edward III. for <HI>annual</HI> Parliaments; <HI>viz.</HI> that the King is not, <Q>or ever was, o∣bliged by these Statutes to call <HI>a new</HI> Parliament every year,</Q> <HI>&amp;c.</HI> He has caused the word <HI>new</HI> to be printed in <HI>Ita∣lics,</HI> as if he meant thereby to insinuate, that the Legislatures of those early times were not unacquainted with our modern idea of conferring on the popular Repre∣sentation a kind of <HI>continued senatorial dignity,</HI> without <HI>Re-election,</HI> for several years together; whereas he certainly must have known that this corrupt <HI>modern</HI> practice has produced a <HI>new order</HI> of men amongst us, a most dangerous increase of aristocratical power, which was entirely
<PB N="46" REF="43"/>unknown to our Ancestors in the glorious reign of Edward III. If he could shew that there <HI>ever</HI> was a Parliament, in those times, that was <HI>not a</HI> NEW <HI>Parlia∣ment,</HI> his Comment might be justified! But it is notorious that Writs were issued to the Sheriffs, for <HI>new</HI> Elections, almost <HI>every year</HI> during that whole reign: The Writs, for the most part, are still preser∣ved with the Returns upon them. In the catalogue of Election-Writs, which Prynne has given in his <HI>Brevia Parlia∣mentaria Rediviva,</HI> p. 4 to 6, there is an account of Writs issued for <HI>new</HI> Elections in every year of that King's reign, be∣tween his 34th (when the last Act for annual Parliaments was made) and his 50th year, except 3, <HI>viz.</HI> the 40th, 41st, and 48th, years; in which years the Records of Summons to the Prelates and Lords of Parliament are also wanting, as appears by Sir William Dugdale's <Q>per∣fect
<PB N="47" REF="44"/>Copy of Summons to Parliament of the Nobility,</Q> <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>And yet this affords no absolute proof that Parliaments were not holden <HI>in those very years</HI> for which the Writs are want∣ing; because the bundles of Writs for the said years may have been lost or mislaid. The only wonder is, that more have not been lost, when we consider the very little care that had been taken of them; for Prynne found many of these Writs dispersed among a vast miscellane∣ous heap of other records on various sub∣jects, (as he himself relates in his Epistle-Dedicatory to King Charles II. of his <HI>Brevia Parliamentaria Rediviva,)</HI> cal∣ling the said heap a <Q><HI>confused Chaos,</HI> under corrding putrifying cobwebs, dust, and filth, in the darkest corner of Caesar's Chapel in the White Tow∣er, as <HI>mere useless Reliques not worthy to be calendred,</HI></Q> <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And, in page 103 of that same work, he speaks of 117
<PB N="48" REF="45"/>Bundles of Writs, whereof 97 had only been then <HI>lately</HI> discovered, filed, and bundled, by himself: <Q>But many of these 117 Bundles</Q> (says he) <Q>are <HI>not compleat,</HI> above half or three parts of the Writs being either rotted, con∣sumed, maymed, torn, or <HI>utterly lost,</HI> through carelessness, wet, cankers, or other casualties; and some of them have not above two, three, or four Writs, and one or two but one Writ and Retorn remaining.</Q></P>
<P>But that there were really Writs for Parliaments, even in those <HI>three</HI> years, which appear to be wanting, at least in <HI>two</HI> of them, is very certain; because it was in the 40th year of this reign, as Sir Edward Coke informs us, (4 Inst. p. 13,) that the Pope demanded homage for the kingdoms of England and Ireland, and the arrears of revenue granted by King John to Pope Innocent III. <Q>whereupon the King, in the <HI>same
<PB N="49" REF="46"/>year, calleth his Court of Parliament,</HI></Q> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In this Parliament it was unanimously agreed, by the Prelates, Dukes, Counts, Barons, and <HI>Commons,</HI> ("et <HI>la Commun,</HI>" and again, <HI>"et Communes,"</HI>) <Q>that the said King John, nor no other, could put himself, nor his Realm, nor his People, in such Subjection, without their <HI>Assent</HI> ('sans assent de eux'); and, if it was done, it was done without their Assent,</Q> (that is, without the Assent of the <HI>Common;</HI> for the Assent of the Barons was expressed in the Charter,) <Q>and con∣trary to his Oath at his Coronation,</Q> p. 14. Where∣upon Lord Coke remarks, in the margin, that <Q>no King can put himself, nor his Realm, nor his Peo∣ple, in such Subjection, without Assent of the <HI>Lords and Commons in Parliament,</HI></Q> <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE> &amp;c. as Sir Edward Coke proves from the Parliament-Rolls of that year, N<SUP>o</SUP> 8, remarking, at the same time, that the Act then made was "never yet printed." See the margin, 4th Inst. p. 13.</P>
<P>And it appears that a Parliament was held also in the 48th year of this reign, because supplies were in that year granted to the King by Parliament, as related by Sir Richard Baker, in his Chronicle, p. 173, <HI>viz.</HI> <Q><HI>in his eight and fortieth year,</HI> IN A PARLIAMENT, is granted
<PB N="50" REF="47"/>him a 10th of the Clergy, and a 15th of the Laity.</Q> So that there is but <HI>one</HI> year, out of so many, in which we cannot trace the meeting of the annual Parliaments: And <HI>annual</HI> Writs for <HI>new</HI> Elections were regularly issued for the first 18 years of the following reign, (as appears by Prynne's <Q>2d part of a brief Register and Survey of the several kinds and forms of parliamentary Writs,</Q> pages 116 and 117,) till Rich∣ard II. (that wretched perjured monarch) had rendered himself <HI>absolute.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">His arbitrary proceedings very soon afterwards oc∣casioned his own Loss of Power, and total Fjectment from the Throne; so that, notwithstanding his boasted <HI>Firmness</HI> in executing his favourite measures, he was at last reduced to the most abject acknowledgements of his own unworthiness to reign.</NOTE></P>
<P>After considering these unquestionable evidences of the issuing Writs <HI>annualy</HI> for <HI>new</HI> Elections, it will be difficult to comprehend the meaning of Sir William Blackstone's Comment on the said two
<PB N="51" REF="48"/>Acts for <HI>annual</HI> Parliaments: <Q>Not that he (the King) is, or ever was, obliged by these Statutes to call a <HI>new</HI> Parlia∣ment every year; but only to permit a Parliament to sit annually for the re∣dress of grievances and dispatch of bu∣siness, <HI>if need be.</HI> — These last words</Q> (says he) <Q>are so <HI>loose and vague,</HI> that such of our monarchs, as were incli∣ned to govern without Parliaments, neglected the convoking them, some∣times for a considerable period, under pretence that there <HI>was no need of them,</HI></Q> &amp;c.</P>
<P>But <HI>"these last words"</HI> are not <Q><HI>so loose and vague</HI></Q> as either to justify his own explanation of the said Statues, (<HI>viz.</HI> not <Q>to call a <HI>new</HI> Parliament every year, but only to <HI>permit</HI> a Parliament to sit,</Q> <HI>&amp;c.</HI>) or to excuse, in the least degree, the criminal neglects of those de∣praved monarchs who were inclined to govern without them: for the words,
<PB N="52" REF="49"/><HI>"if need be,"</HI> cannot, according to the most obvious sense of the Act wherein they are found, be applied to the main purpose of the Act, (the holding <HI>annual Parliaments,</HI>) but merely to the remain∣ing part of the sentence, <HI>viz.</HI><Q><HI>and more often:</HI></Q> that is, <Q>and more often, if need be.</Q> The Order, <Q><HI>that a Par∣liament shall be holden</HI> EVERY YEAR ONCE,</Q> is absolute; and the discretio∣nary power, expressed in the words <Q><HI>if need be,</HI></Q> relates apparently to the cal∣ling Parliaments <HI>"more often:"</HI> for, if the said discretionary words, <HI>"if need be,"</HI> could, with any propriety, be applied to the whole sentence, the Act itself would have been nugatory; which could never be the <HI>intention</HI> of the Legislature: but the true meaning and sense of the Legisla∣ture is very clearly proved by the histories of those times: for it is manifest, not only that <HI>new</HI> Representatives were elected <HI>e∣very year</HI> (with only one exception) for a
<PB N="53" REF="50"/>considerable number of years after the last of the said Acts was made, (which confirms the main purpose of the Acts, <HI>viz.</HI> the holding <HI>annual Parliaments,</HI>) but it is also manifest, that Parliaments were frequently holden <HI>"more often"</HI> than once a year; <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Writs were issued for electing 3 <HI>new</HI> Parliaments in the 6th year of Edw. III. 2 in his 11th year, 3 in his 12th year, and even 4 in his 14th year; and there appear to have been 2 <HI>new</HI> Parliaments in the 7th of Rich. II. See <HI>Prynne's Brevia Parliamentaria Rediviva,</HI> p. 5 &amp; 6.</NOTE> which amply confirms al∣so what I have before said, concerning the meaning of the discretionary power, expressed in the said Act, by the words <HI>"if need be."</HI></P>
<P>These very frequent Elections (some∣times two, three, and four, times IN ONE YEAR) sufficiently prove that the power, delegated by the people to their Representatives, continued no longer in force than during the Session of the par∣ticular Parliament to which they were
<PB N="54" REF="51"/>summoned; which being <Q><HI>once determi∣ned,</HI></Q> (says Prynne, ist part of Brief Register, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of Parl. Writs, p. 334.) <Q><HI>they presently ceased to be Knights, Citi∣zens, Burgesses, Barons, in any succeed∣ing Parliaments or Councils, unless newly elected and retorned to serve in them, by the King's</HI> NEW <HI>Writs, as our Law-Books</HI></Q> (referring to 4 Ed.

And therefore Judge Blackstone's insi∣nuation, against the calling of a <HI>new</HI> Par∣liament, has no real foundation: for, if it was the intention of the Legislature, in the two Acts abovementioned, that the King should ever summon <HI>any Parlia∣ment at all,</HI> they must necessarily be un∣derstood to mean a <HI>new</HI> Parliament on all occasions; <HI>i. e.</HI> not only that the regu∣lar Parliaments, which they ordained <Q><HI>to be</HI> holden every <HI>year once,</HI></Q> should be <HI>new</HI> Parliaments, but also those that
<PB N="55" REF="52"/>should be summoned upon any extraordi∣nary unforeseen occasions; which is suf∣ficiently expressed in the 1st of the said Acts, by the words, <Q><HI>and more often, if need be.</HI></Q> The meaning of the Act is <HI>unquestionably</HI> proved by the actual issuing of writs, to the Sheriffs, for electing Knights, Citizens, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> for <HI>two, three,</HI> and sometimes <HI>four, new</HI> Parliaments, <HI>in one year,</HI> as mentioned above: And if any person should object, that such <HI>very fre∣quent Elections</HI> must be attended with in∣superable difficulties and inconveniences, we may quote the experience of all an∣cient times, as affording ample and suffi∣cient proofs to the contrary; <Q>there be∣ing not above two or three cases of e∣lections questioned, or complained of, from 49 Hen. III. till 22 Edw IV.</Q> (that is, more than 200 years,) <Q>for ought that appears by the Retornes or Parliament-Rolls, and NOT SO MUCH
<PB N="56" REF="53"/>AS ONE DOUBLE RETORNE or IN∣DENTURE, wherewith all the <HI>late</HI> Bun∣dles, or Writs, are stored, and the House of Commons, and <HI>late</HI> Com∣mittees of Privileges pestered, perplex∣ed, to the <HI>great retarding</HI> of the more weighty public affairs of the King and Kingdom.</Q> Prynne, Brevia Parl. Re∣div. p. 137. This enormous evil, the retardment of business, by undue Re∣turns, will not (I may venture, without the spirit of prophecy, to assert) be reme∣died by the <HI>new Regulation</HI> for that pur∣pose. The Commons were never (in ancient times of Freedom) esteemed the proper Judges of their own Elec∣tions, but the <HI>King</HI> alone, that is, in his <HI>limited</HI> judicial capacity, by his Justices and his sworn Juries, in the Courts of Common-Law. If my countrymen will seriously consider all these points, they must be convinced that the only sure method of healing the alarming distem∣pers
<PB N="57" REF="54"/>of our political Constitution <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Viz.</HI> the enormous national Debt; the numerous Pensions; the secret parliamentary Insluence; a stand∣ing Army of near 100 Battalions of Foot, besides Ca∣valry, in time of Peace! [this was first printed in 1774] <HI>&amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</HI> which must render the <HI>Estates</HI> and <HI>Property</HI> of individuals precarious and insecure, or finally EAT THEM UP with <HI>growing burthens,</HI> if these fatal symp∣toms of the most dangerous <HI>political consumption</HI> are not speedily checked and thrown off, by the wholesome pre∣scriptions of a <HI>free and equal Representation of</HI> THE PEO∣PLE <HI>annually elected.</HI></NOTE> is to restore to the people their ancient and just Right to elect a <HI>new</HI> Parliament, <Q><HI>every year once,</HI> and <HI>more often if need be.</HI></Q></P>
<P>No Parliament could have any right to deprive the people of this inestimable Law, unless the Representatives had ex∣pressly consulted their respective consti∣tuents upon it; as the alteration was of too much moment to be intrusted to the discretion of any <HI>Representatives</HI> or <HI>Depu∣ties</HI> whatsoever, being infinitely more important than <Q><HI>any new device,</HI> moved on the King's behalf, in Parliament, <HI>for his aid, or the like;</HI></Q> for the most
<PB N="58" REF="55"/>essential and fundamental Right of the <HI>whole body of the Commons</HI> (I mean the <HI>Principals,</HI> not the <HI>Deputies</HI> or <HI>Agents</HI>) was materially injured by the fatal change, and the people's power of controul, for the general good of the kingdom, was thereby apparently diminished! so that, if it is the duty of Representatives (even in <HI>"any new device"</HI> of mere <Q><HI>aid, or the like</HI></Q>) to consult their Constituents, how much more, upon the proposal of so material an alteration in the Constitu∣tion, ought they to have answered, that, <Q><HI>in this new device, they</HI> DARE NOT AGREE WITHOUT CONFE∣RENCE WITH THEIR COUN∣TRIES!</Q> These are the words of Lord Coke, who mentions them as the proper answer, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See also the answer of the Commons in 13 Edw. III. (as reported in Sir Robert Cotton's Abridgement of the Records, &amp;c. p. 17.) almost in the same words.</NOTE> <Q><HI>when any new device is moved,</HI></Q> &amp;c. and he adds, <Q>whereby it appeareth</Q> (says he) <Q>that SUCH
<PB N="59" REF="56"/>CONFERENCE <HI>is warrantable by th law and custome of Parliament,</HI></Q> 4th Inst. p. 14; so that no <HI>Representative</HI> can be justified (according to <Q><HI>the Law and Custome of Parliament</HI></Q>) who re∣fuses to receive the Instructions of his Constituents, notwithstanding that seve∣ral very sensible, worthy, and (I believe) sincerely patriotic, gentlemen have lately declared themselves to be of a <HI>contrary opinion;</HI> but, when they peruse the seve∣ral authorities which I have cited, con∣cerning the absolute necessity of a <HI>very frequent appeal</HI> to the sense of <HI>the whole body of the people,</HI> I trust, in their can∣dour and love of truth, that they will alter their sentiments.</P>
