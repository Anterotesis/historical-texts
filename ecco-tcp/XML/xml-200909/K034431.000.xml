<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Lincoln's-inn,</HI> <DATE>25th <HI>Jan.</HI> 1763.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>THE Author's compliments to Miss EL∣LIOT, and he desires to inscribe to her the following scenes. She need not be alarmed at a dedication, the propriety of which will strike every reader, who remembers that Miss ELLIOT and the CITIZEN made their first appearance on the stage together, and that her uncommon talents gave the piece the best and most effectual protection. Elegance of figure, a voice of plea∣sing variety, a strong expression of humour, not impaired, but rendered exquisite, by delicacy; these were circumstances that secured the farce at first, and have since brought it into favour. No author ever met with a better patronage; and though the CITIZEN, like other <HI>things of this kind,</HI> has many faults, yet it has this peculiar merit, that it produced, in the character of MA∣RIA, a genuine comic genius. The CITIZEN claims another praise. When all the little arts of theatrical malice were conspiring against her, it recommended Miss ELLIOT to the notice of Mr. BEARD, and obtained for her that generous treat∣ment, which <HI>that manager</HI> seems determined to extend to real merit. The Author therefore de∣sires Miss ELLIOT'S acceptance of this farce, for the defects of which he makes no apology, be∣cause, should the most severe judge in this kind resolve to arm himself with criticisms, let him but look at the acting of MARIA, <HI>and he will forget them all.</HI></P>

<STAGE>YOUNG WILDING, BEAUFORT, <HI>and</HI> WILL <HI>following.</HI></STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wilding.</SPEAKER>
<P>HA, ha, my dear Beaufort! A fiery young fellow like you, melted down into a sighing love-sick dangler after a high heel, a well-turn'd ankle, and a short petticoat!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Beau.</SPEAKER>
<P>Prithee, Wilding, don't laugh at me—Maria's charms—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>Maria's charms! And so now you would fain grow wanton in her praise, and have me listen to your raptures about my own sister! ha, ha, poor Beaufort! —Is my sister at home, Will?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>She is, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>How long has my father been gone out?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>This hour, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very well. Pray give Mr. Beaufort's com∣pliments to my sister, and he is come to wait upon her — <STAGE>(<HI>Exit</HI> Will.)</STAGE> You will be glad to see her I sup∣pose, Charles.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Beau.</SPEAKER>
<P>I live but in her presence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>Live but in her presence! How the devil could the young baggage raise this riot in your heart? 'Tis more than her brother could ever do with any of her sex.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="2" REF="5"/>
<SPEAKER>Beau.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, you have no reason to complain; you are come up to town, post-haste, to marry a wealthy citizen's daughter, who only saw you last season at Tun∣bridge, and has been languishing for you ever since.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's more than I do for her; and to tell you the truth, more than I believe she does for me.—This is a match of prudence, man! bargain and sale!—My reverend dad and the old put of a citizen finished the business at Lloyd's Coffee-house by inch of candle—a mere transferring of property!—<Q>Give your son to my daughter, and I will give my daughter to your son.</Q> That's the whole affair, and so I am just ar∣rived to consummate the nuptials.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Beau.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thou art the happiest fellow—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>Happy! so I am—what should I be otherwise for? If Miss Sally—upon my soul I forget her name—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Beau.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well! that is so like you—Miss Sally Phil∣pot—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay! very true—Miss Sally Philpot—she will bring fortune sufficient to pay off an old incumbrance upon the family-estate, and my father is to settle hand∣somely upon me—and so I have reason to be contented, have not I?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Beau.</SPEAKER>
<P>And you are willing to marry her, without having one spark of love for her?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>Love!—why I make myself ridiculous enough by marrying, don't I? without being in love into the bargain! What! am I to pine for a girl that is willing to go to bed to me? Love of all things!—My dear Beaufort, one sees so many people breathing raptures about each other before marriage, and dinning their insipidity into the ears of all their acquaintance; <Q>My dear ma'am, don't you think him a sweet man? charminger creature never was.</Q> Then he, on his side— <Q>My life, my angel, oh! she's a paradise of ever blooming sweets.</Q> And then in a month's time, <Q>He's a perfidious wretch! I wish I had never seen his face—the devil was in me when I had any thing to say to him."—"Oh! damn her for an inanimated piece—I wish she'd poison herself with all my heart.</Q> That is ever the way; and so
<PB N="3" REF="6"/>you see, love is all nonsense; well enough to furnish romances for boys and girls at circulating libraries; that is all, take my word for it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Beau.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pho! this is all idle talk; and in the mean time, I am ruin'd—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>How so?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Beau.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, you know the old couple have bargain'd your sister away.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>Bargain'd her away! and will you pretend you are in love?—Can you look tamely on, and see her barter'd away at Garraway's like logwood, cochineal, or indigo? Marry her privately, man, and keep it a secret till my affair is over.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Beau.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dear Wilding, will you propose it to her</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>With all my heart—She is very long a com∣ing—I'll tell you what, if she has a fancy for you, carry her off at once—But perhaps she has a mind to this cub of a citizen, Miss Sally's brother—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Beau.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh no! he's her aversion—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have never seen any of the family, but my wife that is to be; my father-in-law and my brother-in-law, I know nothing of them. What sort of a fellow is the son?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Beau.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! a diamond of the first water! a buck, Sir, a blood! every night at this end of the town; at twelve next day he sneaks about the Change, in a little bit of a frock and a bob-wig, and looks like a sedate book-keeper in the eyes of all who behold him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>Upon my word, a gentleman of spirit.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Beau.</SPEAKER>
<P>Spirit!—he drives a phaeton two story high, keeps his girl at this end of the town, and is the gay George Philpot all round Covent Garden.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh brave!—and the father—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Beau.</SPEAKER>
<P>The father, Sir—But here comes Maria; take his picture from her—</P>
<STAGE>[She sings within.]</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hey! she is musical this morning; she holds her usual spirits, I find.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Beau.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, yes, the spirit of eighteen, with the idea of a lover in her head—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay! and such a lover as you too! tho' still in her teens, she can play upon all your foibles, and
<PB N="4" REF="7"/>treat you as she does her monkey, tickle you, torment you, enrage you, sooth you, exalt you, depress you, pity you, laugh at you—<HI>Ecce signum!</HI></P>
</SP>

<P>The same giddy girl!—Sister; come my dear—</P>

<P>Have done, brother; let me have my own way—I will go through my song.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have not seen you this age; ask me how I do?—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maria.</SPEAKER>
<P>I won't ask you how you do—I won't take any notice of you, I don't know you—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do you know this gentleman then? Will you speak to him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maria.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, I won't speak to him; I'll sing to him; it's my humour to sing.</P>
<STAGE>[Sings.]</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Beau.</SPEAKER>
<P>Be serious but for a moment, Maria; my all depends upon it—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maria.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! sweet Sir, you are dying, are you? then positively I will sing the song; for it is a descrip∣tion of yourself—mind it, Mr. Beaufort—mind it—Brother, how do you do? <STAGE>[kisses him.]</STAGE> Say nothing, don't interrupt me—</P>

<P>Long to see him, Maria!</P>

<P>Make me ridiculous if you will, Maria; so you don't make me unhappy, by marrying this citizen—</P>

<P>Have you? Well, come, I will be sensible—there, I blow all my folly away—'Tis gone, 'tis gone, and now I'll talk sense; come—Is that a sensible face?</P>

<P>Po, po, be quiet, and hear what we have to say to you.</P>

<P>I will, I am quiet. It is charming weather; it will be good for the country, this will.</P>

<P>Po, ridiculous! how can you be so silly?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maria.</SPEAKER>
<P>Bless me! I never saw any thing like you—there is no such thing as satisfying you—I am sure it was very good sense what I said—Papa talks in that manner—Well, well! I'll be silent then—I won't speak at all; will that satisfy you?</P>
<STAGE>[Looks sullen.]</STAGE>

<P>Come, come, my little giddy sister, you must not be so flighty; behave sedately, and don't be a girl always</P>

<P>Why don't I tell you I have not seen him—but I am to see him this very day.</P>
</SP>

<PB N="6" REF="9"/>
<SPEAKER>Beau.</SPEAKER>
<P>To see him this day, Maria?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maria.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha, ha!—look there, brother; he is begin∣ning again—But don't fright yourself, and I'll tell you all about it—My papa comes to me this morning—by the by, he makes a fright of himself with his strange dress—Why does not he dress as other gentle∣men do, brother!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>He dresses like his brother fox-hunters in Wiltshire—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maria.</SPEAKER>
<P>But when he comes to town, I wish he would do as other gentlemen do here—I am almost asham'd of him—But he comes to me this morning—<Q>Hoic! hoic! our Moll—Where is the sly puss—Tally ho!</Q>—Did you want me, papa?—Come hither, Moll, I'll <HI>gee</HI> you a husband, my girl; one that has mettle enow—he'll take cover, I warrant un—Blood to the bone.</P>

<P>There now, Wilding, did not I tell you this?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>Where are you to see the young citizen?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maria</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, papa will be at home in an hour, and then he intends to drag me into the city with him, and there the sweet creature is to be introduced to me—The old gentleman, his father, is delighted with me, but I hate him, an old ugly thing—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>Give us a description of him; I want to know him—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maria.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why he looks like the picture of Avarice, sitting with pleasure upon a bag of money, and tremb∣ling for fear any body should come and take it away—He has got square-toed shoes, and little tiny buckles, a brown coat, with small round brass buttons, that looks as if it was new in my great-grandmother's time, and his face all shrivell'd and pinch'd with care, and he shakes his head like a mandarine upon a chimney-piece—Ay, ay, Sir Jasper, you are right, and then he grins at me; I profess she is a very pretty bale of goods. Ay, ay, and my son Bob is a very sensible lad—ay, ay! and I will underwrite their happiness for one and a half <HI>per cent.</HI></P>

<P>Oh! my dear brother, you are very good—but don't mistake yourself; though just come from a boarding-school, give me leave to manage for myself—There is in this case a man I like, and a man I don't like—It is not you I like <STAGE>[<HI>to</HI> Beaufort]</STAGE>—no—no—I hate you—But let this little head alone; I know what to do—I shall know how to prefer one, and get rid of the other.</P>

<P>Very well—what then? what then?—Oh—I have it—I understend you—say no more—'tis charming; I like it of all things; I'll do it, I will; and I will so plague him, that he shan't know what to make of me—He shall be a very toad-eater to me; the sour, the sweet, the bitter, he shall swallow all, and all shall work upon him alike for my diversion. Say nothing of it—it's all among ourselves; but I won't be cruel. I hate ill-nature, and then who knows but I may like him?</P>

<P>There was your neighbour's son, Dick Worthy, who was always cramming his head with Greek and Latin at school; he wanted to borrow of me the other day, but I was too cunning.</P>

<P>Ay, ay—Let him draw bills of exchange in Greek and Latin, and see where he will get a pound sterling for them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G. Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>So I told him—I went to him to his garret, in the Minories; and there I found him in all his misery; and a fine scene it was—There was his wife in a corner of the room, at a washing-tub, up to the elbows in suds; a solitary pork-stake was dangling by a bit of pack-thread, before a melancholy fire; himself seated at a three-legg'd table, writing a pamphlet against the German war; a child upon his left knee, his right-leg employ'd in rocking a cradle with a bratling in it—And so there was business enough for them all—His wife rubbing away <STAGE>[mimicks a washer-woman]</STAGE> and he writing on, <Q>The King of Prussia shall have no more subsidies; Saxony shall be indemnify'd—He shan't have a foot in Silesia.</Q> There is a sweet little baby! <HI>[to the child on his knee]</HI> then he rock'd the cradle, hush ho! hush ho!—then twisted the griskin, <HI>[snaps his fingers]</HI> hush ho!

<P>Oh! no; charity begins at home, says I.</P>

<P>How is this? How is this? Then Sir Jasper, you will agree to cancel the deeds, I suppose, for you know—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Jasp.</SPEAKER>
<P>Catch me at that, an ye can! I fulfill'd my promise, and your son refused, and so the wench has looked out slily for herself elsewhere. Did I not tell you she was a clever girl? I ben't asham'd o'my girl—Our Moll, you have done no harm, and Mr.
