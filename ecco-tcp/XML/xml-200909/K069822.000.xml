<HEAD>LETTER I. On the absurdity of <HI>Authoritative</HI> TOLERATION of <HI>gross Heresy, Blasphemy</HI> or <HI>Idolatry.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HOW God himself connected religion, and the civil welfare of nations, in his ancient laws, almost the whole of the Old Testament doth bear witness. That religion is the great basis of civil happiness, was the common, the avowed belief of e∣very sensible Heathen: It was, for ought I know, the infamous monster Tiberius, who first pretended, <HI>That the Gods alone ought to regard or resent the injuries done them.</HI> Before the happy Reformation, the Popish clergy had reduced civil rulers into mere tools for exe∣cuting their pleasure in religious matters; and pre∣tended that they <HI>had no power of judging</HI> in them. To free these rulers from such Antichristian claims, the Protestant reformers, every where, as their Confessi∣ons of faith and other writings make evident, loudly maintained, That to magistrates themselves indepen∣dent of clergymen, belongs a distinguished power in the <HI>reformation</HI> and <HI>preservation</HI> of religion. Not long after, Erastus, a German physician and his fol∣lowers, to curry favour with their respective princes, pretended, That magistrates are the proper lords of the Christian church, from whom her ministers and other rulers derive their whole power, and to whom they must be accountable. This notion, exceedingly flattering their ambition, was too greedily embraced by most of the Protestant princes; nor do I know of one Protestant church, which hath not suffered by
<PB N="4" REF="4"/>
means of it. Meanwhile, the German Anabaptists, having experienced the frowns, and sometimes the improper severities of magistrates, copied after the ancient Donatists in the like circumstances, and warm∣ly contended, That magistrates have no more power about religious matters than any private person, and ought to punish none for different sentiments in doc∣trine or forms of worship. The Socinians and re∣monstrant Arminians, except when magistrates favour∣ed themselves, and promoted their cause, zealously contended for the same notion, at least in the case of ministers and worship, which were not maintained at the public expence. Many, if not most of the Eng∣lish Independents in the last century were much of the same mind; and hence, by their influence, some pas∣sages in the Westminster Confession of Faith could ne∣ver obtain a ratification by the English Parliament, or a place in their own <HI>Savoy Confession.</HI> Part of these passages, relative to the magistrate's power, are also dropt from the Confession of Faith agreed to by the Independents of New England in 1682. Most of the English Dissenters of this century seem to be much of the same mind; especially such as might otherwise have been exposed to danger on account of their open maintenance of Arian, Socinian, and Quakerish blas∣phemies—Locke and bishop Hoadly, and some others of the Episcopalian party, warmly espoused the same cause.</P>
<P>This notion never received much countenance in Scotland, till Mr Glass of Tealing commenced a fu∣rious new-fashioned Independent. He mightily con∣tended, That the Jewish nation was an ecclesiastical one, and their kings ecclesiastical rulers; that Chris∣tian magistrates have no more power in religious mat∣ters than private Christians, and ought not to employ their power in advancing the true religion, or in mak∣ing laws with penalties in favour of it; or in restraining or punishing heretics or false teachers, nor ought they to give more encouragement to good Christians, than to other peaceable subjects;—that the example of the re∣forming kings of Judah in punishing idolatry and false worship, and in promoting the true religion, is not now to be imitated; and that our fathers national
<PB N="5" REF="5"/>
covenanting against Popery and other wickedness, in favour of the true religion was <HI>unwarrantable,</HI> and is <HI>not binding</HI> upon us.—<HI>Dr. Wisheart, Principal of the college of Edinburgh,</HI> in his sermons contended, That magistrates have only a right to punish such crimes as strike immediately against the persons or property of men; but not to punish any thing which strikes im∣mediately against the honour of God, as blasphe∣my or heresy; that all men ought to have civil liber∣ty to think and speak as they please, providing they make no attack upon the welfare of civil society; that none ought to be hampered in their search after truth by any requirement of their subscriptions to <HI>Formu∣las</HI> or <HI>Confessions of Faith;</HI> that children in their edu∣cation, ought never to be biassed to a side by learning catechisms which maintain the peculiar principles of a party. These or the like notions have been adopt∣ed by not a few of the pretenders to modern illumi∣nation.</P>
<P>In her <HI>public Standards,</HI> the Church of Scotland hath renounced, and in her solemn covenants hath abjured both these extremes. In her <HI>Old Confession of Faitb,</HI> which is expresly sworn to in the national cove∣nant of 1581, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as <HI>in all points the undoubted truth of God,</HI> Art. xxiv, she asserts, that <Q REND="inline">"the power and authority of magistrates is God's <HI>holy ordinance,</HI> or∣dained for manifestation of his own glory, and for the singular profit of mankind—they are the <HI>lieutenants of God,</HI> in whose sessions God himself doth fit and judge—to whom by God is given the sword to the praise and defence of good men, and to punish all o∣pen malefactors. To kings, princes, rulers and ma∣gistrates chiefly, and most principally, the conservati∣on and purgation of religion appertains; so that not only are they appointed for civil policy, but also for maintenance of the true religion, and for suppression of all idolatry and superstition whatsoever."</Q> This doctrine is further asserted and explained in her second book of discipline, chap. ix; The doctrine of her <HI>Westminster Confession of Faith,</HI> the WHOLE of which is solemnly espoused and engaged to, by every Presby∣terian minister and elder in Scotland in his ordination vows, is that <Q REND="inline">"for their publishing opinions or main∣taining
<PB N="6" REF="6"/>
practices contrary to the light of nature and the known principles of Christianity, whether concerning faith, worship or conversation, or to the power of godliness, or such erroneous opinions or practices, as either, in their own nature, or in the manner of pub∣lishing and maintaining them, are destructive to the external peace, and order, which Christ hath establi∣shed in the church, they may be lawfully called to account, and proceeded against by—the power of the civil magist<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ate," Chap. xx. 4.—</Q>that <Q REND="inline">"God, the su∣preme Lord and King of all the world, hath ordained civil magistrates to be under him, over the people, for his own glory and the public good—they ought especially, (in managing their office) to maintain PI∣ETY, justice and peace, according to the <HI>wholesome</HI> laws of each commonwealth—That the civil magis∣trate—HATH authority, and it IS his duty to take order that unity and peace be preserved in the church, and that the truth of God be kept pure and entire; that all blasphemies and heresies be suppressed, all cor∣ruptions and abuses in worship and discipline prevent∣ed and reformed, and all the ordinances of God du∣ly settled, administered and observed. For the better effecting of which, he hath power to call Synods, to be present at them, and to provide that whatsoever is transacted in them be according to the mind of God," Chap. xxiii. 1, 2, 3.—</Q> <Q REND="inline">"The duties required in the second commandment are—the disapproving, detest∣ing, opposing all false worship, and according to each one's place and calling, removing it, and all monu∣ments of idolatry;—The sins forbidden in the second commandment are, all devising, counselling, com∣manding, using, and any ways approving any religi∣ous worship not instituted by God himself, tolerating a false religion." Lar. Cat. Q 108, 109.</Q> These de∣clarations are an authentic explication of the power of the magistrate in <HI>maintaining and preserving the true religion,</HI> the defence of which is expresly sworn in their solemn covenants with God. If therefore, Sir, you discredit this doctrine, and plead the toleration of idolatry, blasphemy, heresy, and that magistrates ought to meddle with nothing in religion, be so ho∣nest, as openly to renounce your ordination vows and
<PB N="7" REF="7"/>
the Confession of Faith and Catechisms, as well as the national Covenant and Solemn League.</P>
<P>To illustrate the above doctrine of our excellent standards, it is proper to observe, (1.) God alone is the necessarily existent, and absolutely independent Creator and preserver, and therefore original and su∣preme proprietor and governor of all things in hea∣ven or earth, Exod. iii. 4. Gen. i. Psal. civ. and xxiv. 1, 2. xxxiii. 6. lxxxiii. 18. xlvii. 2, 7, 9. Ezek. i. 11. Col. i. 16,—18. Dan. iv. 34, 35. (2.) All right, ci∣vil, natural, or spiritual, whether of conscience, or of persons, or of husbands, parents, masters, magis∣trates, ministers, or even of Christ as mediator, must therefore wholly originate from God alone, Psalm cxv. 16. Rom. ii. 36. Heb. ii. 10 Acts x. 25, 28. 2 Cor. v. 18. Psal. lxxv. 7. Dan. ii. 21. iv. 32, 35. Mat. xxviii. 18. ii. 27. John v. 35. To suppose any real<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>right or being whatsoever, unoriginating from him, is to give up with the necessary existence of God, and to plunge into the very <HI>depths of Atheism.</HI> (3.) All right and authority of conscience, persons, hus∣bands, parents, magistrates, ministers, or even of Christ as mediator, being wholly derived from God, ought, necessarily ought, wholly to be improved, or exercised in his name, in conformity and subordinati∣on to his law, as the supreme rule, and in order to promote his declarative glory as the chief end of it. Prov. xvi. 4 Rom ii. 30. 1 Pet. iv. 11. 1 Cor x. 31. John v. 30. viii. 29 vii. 18. Eph iii. 21 (4.) No right or authority derived from God can therefore be lawfully improven or exercised, in protecting, encou∣raging, allowing or commanding any thing which God himself, on account of his infinite perfection in holi∣ness, justice, goodness and truth, cannot command;—or in discouraging, disallowing, or prohibiting any thing which God in his law requires. It is absurd to suppose it, that God can give men a power which he hath not himself; and shocking blasphemy to sup∣pose him capable of giving men a right and authority to contemn or counteract his own law as their rule, or his own glory as their chief end, in every thing they do, 2 Tim. ii. 13. Hab. i. 12, 13. Exod, xv. 11. Deut. xxxii. 4. Zeph. iii. 5. James i. 13. (5.) All the diversified forms of right and authority in conscience,
<PB N="8" REF="8"/>
husbands, parents, masters, magistrates, ministers, and even in Christ as mediator, being derived from the <HI>same God of infinite wisdom and order,</HI> each of them may, and ought to be wholly exercised within its proper de∣partment, and in a manner answerable to its nature, and never in the way of invading the place or inter∣rupting the exercise of any other right or authority. No right of conscience can be exercised to the inter∣ruption of the due exercise of marital, parental, ma∣gisterial, magistratical, ministerial, or Christ's media∣torial authority; nor, can any regular exercise of these powers interrupt the due exercise of the power of conscience, or of one another, 1 Cor. xiv. 33, 40. vii. 20, 24. (6.) All these different forms of power and authority being derived from the <HI>same God,</HI> may have the same things for their object, but viewed in different respects. The same man may be subject to the power of his conscience as he is a rational crea∣ture,—subject to the power of parents as a child,—subject to the power of masters as a servant,—subject to the power of magistrates as a member of the com∣monwealth,—subject to the power of church-rulers as a member of an organized visible church,—subject to the mediatorial power of Christ, as a member of his mystical body, or an agent for promoting the wel∣fare of it.—The same good work of piety or virtue may, or ought to be required by conscience, by pa∣rents, masters, magistrates, ministers, and even by Christ as mediator, in different respects, as calculated to promote the welfare of the persons, families, nati∣ons, and churches concerned,—in subordination to the glory of God as their respective proprietor and superior. The performance of the same good work may be encouraged by rewards from all these diffe∣rent powers, answerable to their respective forms.—The same vices of idolatry, blasphemy, calumny, trea∣son, theft, murder, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as in different respects hurt∣ful to persons, families, civil societies, and churches, may, and ought to be prohibited by all these different powers, and resented by each, as hurtful to itself, as subordinated to God,—in a manner answerable to its particular nature and department,—by conscience with stinging rebukes,—by parents with correction, disin∣heriting,
<PB N="9" REF="9"/>
or the like,—by masters with frowns, stripes, abridgment of wages, or the like,—by magistrates with public dishonour, fining, imprisonment, or death,—by church rulers with ecclesiastical rebuke, excom∣munication,—by Christ with temporal, spiritual or eternal judgment, Acts xxiv. 16. Josh xxiv. 15. Psal. ci. Mat. v, vi, vii, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> (7.) All these powers of conscience, husbands, parents, masters, magistrates, church-rulers, and of Christ as mediator, proceeding from an infinitely wise, powerful and good God, are each of them, in its own place, altogether sufficient to gain its own end.—Nevertheless, it mightily tends to the advantage of each, that all of them be rightly exercised at once, and to the hurt os all the rest, if any of them be not. If conscience act faithfully, this promotes the regular and comfortable exercise of the power of husbands, parents, masters, magistrates or ministers. <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And it is to the advantage of consci∣ence, if they regularly exercise their power, and espe∣cially if Christ exercise his, in a remarkable manner. It is much to the advantage of Church and State, if husbands, parents, and masters, faithfully exercise their power in their respective departments; and much to their hurt, if they do not. If the rulers in Church and State, faithfully discharge their trust, it will tend much to promote the welfare of families. The more faithfully ministers labour in winning souls to Christ, and teaching men to live soberly, righte∣ously and godly in view of Christ's second coming, the more easy will the work of magistrates, and the great∣er the happiness of the commonwealth be.—The more faithfully magistrates act in curbing of crimes, and promoting obedience to God the King of nations, as a mean of securing his felicitating blessing to the commonwealth, the more delightfully will church-power be exercised, and the more abundantly it will tend to the welfare of the church. Nay, though the mediatorial power of Christ be infinitely sufficient in its own place, to answer its own ends, yet the delight∣ful exercise and success of it is not a little promoted by the faithful exercise of the powers of conscience, husbands, parents, masters, magistrates and church-rulers, Acts xxiv. 16. 1 Tim. i. 5. Eph. iv,—vi. Col.
<PB N="10" REF="10"/>
iii. iv. 1 &amp; 2 Tim. Titus i.—iii. 1 Pet. ii.—v. Psalm ii. 10, 12. Rev. ii. 15. xvii. 14, 16. xxi. 24. Isa. xlix. 23. lx, 3, 4, 10, 16. (8.) Though the marital, pa∣rental, magisterial, magistratical, and ministerial pow∣ers be altogether distinct from, and independent of one another, and each of them have its own particu∣lar exercises pertaining to it alone;—yet the same per∣son, in respect of different relations, may be at once superior or inferior to another person,—and so may be required to fulfil the particular duties of his station, by one who hath not any lawful right to perform them himself. Thus magistrates and ministers as such, may require husbands to perform their duties to their wives, parents to perform theirs to their children, or masters theirs to their servants, as a mean of promot∣ing the welfare of the commonwealth and of the church, in obedience to God, and aiming at his glo∣ry. An uncrowned husband of a queen may com∣mand her, faithfully to exercise her magistratical power, as a means of honour and happiness to his family; and she as queen may command him in eve∣ry thing relating to the welfare of the state, as her of∣ficer or subject. A parent may require his son, as such, faithfully to exercise his ministerial, magistra∣tical, or magisterial power as a mean of honour and happiness to his family. A son may command his fa∣ther, who is his servant, in every thing pertaining to the service due from him, and even to order his fami∣ly aright, in so far as it tends to promote that service. Ministers, as the ambassadors of Christ, have power to require magistrates, <HI>as church members,</HI> faithfully to exercise their magistratical power, so as may best promote the honour of Christ, and the welfare of his church. And on the other hand, magistrates have power to require ministers <HI>as their subjects,</HI> faithfully to exercise their ministerial power, as a mean of ren∣dering the nation pious and virtuous, in order to pro∣mote its happiness,—and all this in subordination to the law, and to promote the glory of God as the su∣preme governor of families, churches, or nations. (9.) Though the marital, parental, magisterial, ma∣gistratical and ministerial powers, have, each of them,
<PB N="11" REF="11"/>
something for its peculiar and distinguishing object, in which no other power can interfere with it;—Thus it is always unlawful for husbands, parents, mas∣ters or ministers, <HI>as such,</HI> to assume the power of civil magistrates in levying taxes, adjudging criminals to death,—always unlawful for parents, masters, or ma∣gistrates, <HI>as such,</HI> to preach the gospel, dispense sacra∣ments; or church-censures;—yet if the exercise of some of these powers be fearfully neglected or abused, the other powers may be exercised, in order to rec∣tify the disorders occasioned, further than would be proper if there were no such neglect, abuse, or dis∣order. Thus if husbands, parents, or masters, fear∣fully abuse their power, relative to wives, children, or servants, the rulers of church or state, for the be∣nefit of these societies, may interfere more with their family-concerns, than would be proper in other cir∣cumstances. If church-rulers be notoriously negli∣gent or wicked, magistrates <HI>as church-members,</HI> and to <HI>promote the welfare of the state,</HI> may do more in the re∣formation of the church, than would be proper for them, if church rulers were diligent and faithful. And, if through the indolence or wickedness of ma∣gistrates, the affairs of the nation be thrown into terri∣ble confusion, ministers <HI>as members of the commonwealth, and to promote the welfare of the church,</HI> may do more in the rectification of affairs, than would be proper, if the magistrates were faithful, 2 Kings xi. 2 Chron. xxiii (10.) All governing authority empowers the possessors of it, to issue forth laws or commandments, binding on the subject of it. But these laws or com∣mandments can extend their binding force no further, than the particular department belonging to that pow∣er, as by that, every particular form of authority, de∣rived from God, is limited. The laws or command∣ments of parents, masters, magistrates, and church-rulers, extend only to external things in the family, commonwealth, or church. These of conscience and of Christ extend also to that which is inward in the heart.—And as all human superiors are imperfect in knowledge themselves, and cannot enable their sub∣jects perfectly to understand their whole duty, it is ne∣cessary that laws of families or nations, or constituti∣ons
<PB N="12" REF="12"/>
of churches require <HI>nothing but what is plainly a∣greeable to the law of God,</HI> and nothing in religion but what is <HI>plainly required by the word of God,</HI> that so no∣thing may be contrary to these laws but what is not only <HI>really,</HI> but <HI>plainly</HI> contrary to the word of God. And, the weaker the subjects are, the more conde∣scension ought to be exercised towards them in this matter, Rom. xv, 1, 2. (11.) As men cannot bow the hearts of their inferiors unto subjection, they ought always to issue forth their commandments in the most prudent, mild and gaining manner. It is very im∣proper to issue forth any law doubtful or obscure, or which most of the subjects are not likely to be got peaceably to comply with. This ought especially to be attended to, in the framing and imposing of <HI>laws and constitutions relative to religion,</HI> which ought to be a <HI>reasonable</HI> and <HI>voluntary</HI> service. (12) As noth∣ing, particularly in religion, ought to be contrary to any law of church or state but what is plainly con∣trary to the law of God; and nothing ought to be held <HI>censurable</HI> by the laws of the church, or <HI>punishable</HI> by the laws of the state, but what is <HI>plainly contrary</HI> to these laws, and hath become <HI>duly public,</HI> in the pro∣vidence of God, without requiring the party concern∣ed to be his own accuser.—So, on account of the weakness or number of the offenders, or the disorder∣ed state of the society, <HI>many real scandals</HI> in the church must be forborne without centure, and <HI>many real crimes</HI> against the state forborne without punishment; notwithstanding, it would be extremely wicked, <HI>au∣thoritatively</HI> to license or tolerate them in either. If your children be very young, raving in a fever, deli∣rious, or apt to fall into convulsive fits, it might be very prudent and dutiful for you to forbear severe chastisement of them for playing on the Lord's day; repeating some wicked expressions, they had heard from their fellow children, or the like. But would it be lawful in you to give them a parental licence to profane the Sabbath or name of God, and promise them protection in so doing? You dare not pretend it. God himself wisely forbears the punishment of many things, which his law forbids. (13.) As it is never errors or corruptions <HI>of the heart,</HI> but wick∣ed
<PB N="13" REF="13"/>
words and deeds, sufficiently and regularly mani∣fested, which are to be corrected in families, punish∣ed in commonwealths, or censured in churches, Deut. xiii. 1,—14. xvii. 46. Heb. x. 28. 1 Tim. v. 1—So even in punishing manifest crimes, especially in mat∣ters of religion, all proper mildness ought to be exer∣cised, never proceeding to extremities, where there is any hope of reformation, or where, as in the case of heresy or blasphemy, confession and repentance can make any kind of restitution, Mat. xviii. 15,—18. Among the Hebrews, not one appears to have been punished for idolatry, if he professed repentance and reformation. The princes of Israel first attempted to bring the Reubenites and Gadites, whom they sup∣posed guilty of it, to repentance, Josh. xxii. Never in the reformation by Asa, Hezekiah, or Jofiah, have we one instance of a penitent idolater slain. The idolaters condemned to death, Deut. xiii. xvii. are re∣presented as <HI>men of Belial,</HI> presumptuous, and obsti∣nate in their wickedness. The prophets of Baal whom Elijah caused be put to death, 1 Kings xviii. 40. and Mattan the priest, who was slain by Jehoiada's or∣ders, 2 Kings xi. 18. were no doubt of this sort; and probably also guilty of promoting the murder of the Lord's prophets and people. The man put to death for profanation of the Sabbath, appears to have acted presumptuously, Num. xv. 30,—36. Asa and his subjects covenanted to put to death such as obstinately adhered to idolatry, 2 Chron. xv. 12, 13. (14.) Ma∣gistrates ought never to attempt <HI>forcing</HI> men to believe with their hearts, even the most fundamental truths of religion, or to practise any religious duty,—that be∣ing no means appointed by God for convincing them of the truth, or inducing them to a cordial perfor∣mance of religious duties, 2 Cor. x. 4, 5. But it would be highly absurd, hence to infer, That magis∣trates <HI>may not restrain</HI> men from robbing nations or churches of those divine truths, which God hath gra∣ciously entrusted to them, and which are inexpressi∣bly profitable to them,—or <HI>restrain</HI> them from propa∣gating gross heresies, blasphemies, idolatries, which undermine and exclude the true religion, provoke God o destroy nations, and are the fruitful seeds of
<PB N="14" REF="14"/>
contention, confusion, and every evil work. No ma∣gistrate can compel me to love my neighbour as my self, or can justly compel me to divide mine inheritance with him; but he may lawfully punish me for calum∣niating or robbing him.</P>
<P>It is, therefore, extremely uncandid in the advocates for magistratical tolerations of heresy, blasphemy, and idolatry, always to attempt blending or placing on an equal level, <HI>true</HI> and <HI>false</HI> religion,—<HI>mere neglect</HI> of some positive duties of religion, and <HI>shocking insults</HI> u∣pon, and <HI>opposition</HI> to the duties of religion,—<HI>lesser</HI> and <HI>secret mistakes</HI> in religion, and the <HI>most damnable</HI> heresies, blasphemies, and idolatries, openly and ob∣stinately professed and practised, as if these were e∣qually objects of toleration, restraint, or punishment,—or, to confound a <HI>mere forbearance</HI> to punish, with an <HI>authoritative licence,</HI> openly to prosess and practise what is criminal respecting religion. The true religion ought never to need a toleration. It ought always to have an establishment. Whereas a false one ought never to be established, magistrates having no power against the truth but for the truth. There are <HI>many mere neglects</HI> or <HI>lesser mistakes</HI> in religion, against which it would not be proper for magistrates to enact civil laws, in this present state of imperfection. And, if there be no civil law against them, they cannot be punishable as crimes. <Q REND="inline">"Where no law is, there can be no transgression."</Q>—Mere forbearance to punish, what is plainly contrary to law, is, in some cases, ne∣cessary, and in imitation of God himself; and gives no positive encouragement to wickedness. Whereas a <HI>positive</HI> or <HI>authoritative</HI> toleration, proclaims to men, a liberty to sin, and promiseth them protection in so doing. If the provider for an army deliver to them fine flour mixed with some particles of bran, and a large quantity of arsenic, Is his delivery of the sine flour, or even of the mixture of bran, as criminal and punishable, as that of the mixture of arsenic? No man that is not mad will pretend it.

<P N="1">I. Mens pleadings for it do, all of them, necessarily proceed on their adopting such <HI>atheistical principles</HI> as the following, (1.) Mens natural or civil rights to their property, liberty, profits and honours, are not ori∣ginally derived from God,—and ought to protect them in their most outragious sinning against him (2,) Mens consciences have a right and authority, unde∣rived from, and independent of God, by which it can warrant them to think and speak of, or act to∣wards God, as insolently and blasphemously as they please. (3.) That, if the law of God, be any rule to men; it is not so, in respect of any intrinsic meaning affixed to it by him, but merely as it is understood by every man, particularly in that which relates to their behaviour towards God. (4.) All men being ready to mistake, we ought always to believe that our op∣ponents
<PB N="17" REF="17"/>
may have as just a view of the scriptures as ourselves, and never to condemn them for that which they do not own to be blasphemy, idolatry, or heresy. (5.) Magistrates right and authority to govern others, doth not originate in God as the Creator, Preserver, and King of nations, but in magistrates themselves, <HI>or in their subjects;</HI> and so may be exercised as they please, particularly in requiring or allowing their sub∣jects to belie, blaspheme, or rob God. (6) Magis∣trates may be moral governors deputies or lieutenants, under God, without having any power or authority relating to religion, or his honour. (7.) Not the law of God natural or revealed, but the laws of nations ought to be the <HI>supreme</HI> standard of all civil govern∣ment. (8.) Not the declarative glory of God, as the Most High over all the earth, but the civil peace and prosperity of nations, ought to be the <HI>chief end</HI> of ma∣gistrates in all their acts of government. (9) Mens natural rights of conscience, or their civil rights, or the authority of magistrates, may or ought to empow∣er, warrant, or protect them in gross heresy, blasphe∣my, idolatry, or other outragious abuse and injury of God; but can by no means warrant or protect them in calumny, theft, murder, or any other injuries a∣gainst men. (10.) There is no real difference between moral good and evil, at least in things pertaining to God; and so true and false religion are equally cal∣culated to promote the welfare of civil society, and the virtues which render men good, peaceable, useful, and honourable rulers or subjects,—and hence here∣tics, blasphemers, and idolaters may be <HI>good subjects.</HI> (11.) The favour or indignation of God is of no im∣portance to civil society; and therefore magistrates ought to use no means to procure his favour by the encouragement of true religion, or to avert his indig∣nation by the restraint of gross heresy, blasphemy, or idolatry,—but only labour to procure the friendship of men, and prevent their injuring the character, pro∣perty, or bodies of their subjects—That all these propositions are <HI>really atheistical,</HI> is manifest. They all give up with the necessary existence, infinite excel∣lency, and absolute supremacy of God, without any of which, he cannot be God at all.—That Locke,
<PB N="18" REF="18"/>
Hoadly, Blackburn, Voltaire, and others, advocates for <HI>authoritative toleration</HI> of false religion, found their pleadings on the above propositions, is no less e∣vident to every judicious and unbiassed observer.—Nay, did not modesty forbid, I might defy all the world to plead for <HI>such toleration,</HI> without taking all, or some of the above or like atheistical propositions for granted.</P>
<P N="2">II. The scriptures plainly represent magistrates granting of men an unrestrained freedom to profess and practise a false religion as extremely sinful and hurtful. (1.) It is in the name of God to give a <HI>li∣berty to the flesh,</HI> of which <HI>heresics</HI> and <HI>idolatry</HI> are the manifest and damning works, Gal. v. 13, 19,—21. with Rom. viii, 7, 8. (2.) It is not merely to <HI>pity</HI> and <HI>spare,</HI> but to <HI>encourage</HI> such as seek to draw away their subjects from God, contrary to Deut. xiii. 9, 10. Eph. xiv. 14. 2 Tim. iii. 4, 5, 13. 2 Pet. ii. 1, 2, 3. (3.) In so doing, magistrates, as political shepherds, not only suffer the flock of God, the King of nations, under their charge, to <HI>wander</HI> or be <HI>driven</HI> from their fold and pasture, but encourage them in it,—contra∣ry to Ezek. xxxiv. 5,—8. Acts xx 30. (4.) It marks a heavy judgment of God upon, and an anarchy in a commonwealth, when every man is left without restraint, and doth that which is right in his own eyes, in matters of religion, Judges xvii. 6. Zech. xi. 9, 16. 2 Chron. xx. 33. Amos iv. 4, 5. (5.) In granting <HI>such liberty,</HI> magistrates are not for Christ, by whom they rule, Prov. viii. 15, 16. but against him, in encouraging and protecting the doctrines and works of the devil, which he came to destroy, John viii. 44. 1 Tim. iv. 2. Rev. xvi. 13, 14 with 1 John iii. 8. Zech. xiii. 2. (6) False religion eats out the true doctrine of Christ, and the true piety and virtue which proceed from the faith of it,—which are like joints and bands to connect and establish a nati∣on, Isa. liii. 5. 2 Tim. ii. 16, 17. Gal. v. 10, 11, 12. (7.) Heresies produce <HI>divisions,</HI> 1 Cor. xi. 18, 19. make men <HI>wanton, filthy dreamers, despisers</HI> and <HI>revilers</HI> of magistrates, Jude, ver. 4, 8. 2 Pet. ii. 10,—17. they render times <HI>perilous,</HI> and make men <HI>traitors, heady,</HI>
<PB N="19" REF="19"/>
<HI>high minded, truce-breakers, false accusers, fierce, with∣out natural affection, despisers of those that are good,</HI> 2 Tim iii. 1,—13. They produce <HI>envy, strifes, evil sur∣misings,</HI> and <HI>perverse disputings,</HI> 1 Tim. vi. 3, 4. Gal. v. 19, 20. they spoil Christ's vines, Song ii. 15. (8.) False religion deprives a nation of God's protecting hedge of favourable providence, and opens an inlet or the floods of destructive judgments, Exod. xxxii. 25. Ezek. xiii. 4, 5. and xxii. 30, 31. (9.) Magistrates indulgence of a false religion is represented as <HI>a kicking</HI> at the true religion, and <HI>an honouring</HI> of the corrupters <HI>above God,</HI> and brings a charge of the wickedness upon the tolerators of it. Hence Eli the judge of Israel is represented as <HI>kicking at God's sacrifice, honouring his</HI> profane <HI>sons <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bove God,</HI> and <HI>making himself fat</HI> with God's portion of the sacrifices, because he did not effectu∣ally re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orm his sons, 1 Sam. ii. 12,—16, 23,—25. 29. Eph. v. 7, 11. and Nehemiah contended with the rulers of Judah for suffering the worship of God to be neglected, and the Sabbath profaned, Neh. xiii. 10,—18. (10) Such indulgence of false or corrupt religion is represented as tending to make men abhor the true religion, and speak evil of it, 1 Sam. ii. 17. 2 Pet. ii. 1,—3.</P>
<P N="3">III. The scriptures represent magistrates as having power to make civil laws relative to the external con∣cerns of religion subordinated to the law of God, and answerable to their own department. (1.) They have in charge the keeping of the whole law of God, Deut. xvii. 19 1 Kings ii. 3. Josh. i. 7, 8. 2 Chron xxiii. 11. Job xxix. 25. Rom. xiii. 1,—4. It is never hinted, that they have no charge with respect to religion, but the contrary. God chose Moses the magistrate, not Aaron the High-priest to publish his laws relative to religion.—Abijah avers, that in maintaining the true worship of God, he had kept the charge of the Lord, which Jeroboam the introducer of a false reli∣gion had not, 2 Chron xiii. 10, 11. (2.) God pro∣mised to the Jews good magistrates, in order to root out abusive practices and monuments of false religion, Isa i. 25, 26. Now, if they had power to root these out, they had certainly power to make laws for that effect. (3.) They ought to repeal wicked and perse∣cuting
<PB N="20" REF="20"/>
laws, and free their subjects from being bound over to punishment by them for their faithful service of God, Psalm xciv. 20. Isa. x. 11. Mic. vi. 16. Hos. v. 11. If they can repeal wicked laws, they must have power to establish what is contrary to them, Dan. iii. and vi. (4) If magistrates can make laws encou∣raging the true religion and church of Christ, by an∣nexation of civil favours to the profession or practice of gospel-truth; they can also by law annex civil pu∣nishment to the contempt of, or rebellion against these laws; they being for the <HI>terror and punishment of evil doers,</HI> as well as for the <HI>praise of them that do well,</HI> Rom. xiii. 3, 4. 1 Pet. ii. 13, 14 Dan. vi. 16. iii. 29. Ezra i. 1,—5. vi. 3,—12. vii. 23,—27. (5) By enacting such laws they neither invade the office of ecclesiastical rulers, who have no power to connect civil rewards or punishments, with any thing religious,—nor do they transgress any law of God.—What then can hinder their having power to make them? (6.) If all sorts of men, church members and officers, as well as others, be subject to civil magistrates, they must have power, and ought to make civil laws calcu∣lated to promote their advantage, in all these stations, Rom. xiii. 1,—4. 1 Pet. ii. 13, 14. 1 Tim. ii 1, 2. (7.) Unless magistrates have a power to make good laws relative to the external profession and practice of religion, clergymen, if generally corrupt, will have it in their power, by Synodical constitutions, or other∣wise, to devour and poison their subjects, with the seeds of confusion, profaneness, and every evil work, without any possibility of any legal restraint. For to allow magistrates to act without law, is to introduce tyranny and arbitrary government.</P>
<P>But, in magistrates making laws respecting religion, it is necessary, that [1.] They, first in order, care∣fully acquaint themselves with the law of God, that they may form all their laws in agreeableness and su∣bordination to it,—they having no power against the truth, but for it, Deut. xvii. 18,—20. Josh. i. 7, 8. Psalm cxix. 97,—104. 2 Cor. xiii. 8. [2.] They ought to consult with faithful ministers of the church, either as met in Synods or otherwise; as it may be expected, they know the laws of God relative to reli∣gion,
<PB N="21" REF="21"/>
Deut. xvii. 9,—12. Mal. ii. 7. 2 Chron. xv. 1,—15. Thus, in making these laws, church-rulers help magistrates with their <HI>direction,</HI> while magistrates help them with their <HI>civil encouragements,</HI> 2 Chron. xix. 10, 11. Ezek. xliv. 23, 24 [3.] They ought to require the ministers, who are in their dominions, faithfully to instruct their subjects in the whole coun∣sel of God, contained in his word, relative to those points of religion, about which they intend to make laws, that they may be thus prepared, <HI>willingly</HI> to re∣ceive and obey them.—Thus Jehoshaphat first sent <HI>teachers,</HI> and then <HI>judges</HI> throughout his dominions, 2 Chron. xvii. xix [4.] In all matters of religion, great care ought to be taken to establish the laws, with and by, the consent of the subjects, or their re∣presentatives,—thus strengthening these laws, through their binding men who are <HI>willing</HI> to obey them;—and the rather as the principal end of such laws is lost, unless men willingly obey them, 2 Chron. xv. 9, 13. xx. 21. Jonah iii. 4, 7. [5.] In these laws a special regard ought to be shewn to persons of a weak and tender conscience. Political shepherds ought never to over drive their flock, but to carry the lambs in their bosom. And, that the very weakest of their sub∣jects may be qualified to obey their laws, they ought never to establish any thing in religion, but what is <HI>plainly</HI> as well as <HI>really</HI> established by God in his law;—that so nothing may be contrary to their law, but what is plainly contrary to God's law, Ezek. xxxiv. 4.</P>
<P N="4">IV. Though the law of God allows not of magis∣trates attempting to <HI>force</HI> men into the faith, professi∣on or practice of the true religion, or of their puni∣shing any thing relative to it, which is not an open and manifest violation of the law of God, and plainly de∣structive of the welfare of the commonwealth;—yet it requires them to <HI>restrain,</HI> and even <HI>seasonably</HI> and <HI>suitably</HI> to <HI>punish</HI> blasphemy, idolatry, and like grosser corruptions, and insults upon the true religion, when they become openly notorious, and especially if obsti∣nately continued in to the just offence and hurt of o∣thers. (1.) Such <HI>restraint</HI> and <HI>punishment</HI> are repre∣sented in scripture as an eminent service done to God, Exod. xxxii. 4, 26, 29. 1 Sam. xv. 2, 3. xviii. 22.
<PB N="22" REF="22"/>
Rev. xvii. 14, 16. xix. 17,—19 Song ii. 15 in which last text, the word rendered TAKE ordinarily signifies an external and forcible taking, compare 2 Sam. i. 10. Judges xii. 6. xvi. 3; 21. Psalm. cxxxix. 9. Exod. iv. 4. Gen. xxv. 26. xxii. 13. (2.) The end of God's ap∣pointment of magistrates, is the GOOD of the subjects, Rom. xiv. 4. Now such corruptions in religion impair <HI>that good,</HI> in preventing the spread and success of the gospel, which are so exceedingly calculated to render men virtuous and happy, even in this life, 1 Tim. iv. 8. 1 Pet. iii. 11, 12, 13. Tit. ii. 12. and in promoting the hurt of mens morals, safety; estate, peace or li∣berty, Rom. i. 21,—32. xvi. 18. 2 Pet. ii. 1, 2, 3, 10, 12, 13, 16, 18, 19, Jude, ver 4, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 16, 18, 19. 2 Tim. iv. 3, 4. iii. 1,—9, 13. ii. 16, 17. 1 Tim. iv. 2,—5. vi. 3, 4. (3) Such re∣straint and punishment are represented in scripture as a <HI>blessing</HI> to be prayed for, 1 Tim. ii. 1, 2, 4. and as a <HI>blessing</HI> for which God ought to be thanked, Ezra vii. 25.—28. Rev. xi. 15, 17. (4.) It is promised, that such restraint and punishment should be produc∣ed by the effusion of the holy Ghost upon the Chris∣tian church, Zech. xii. 10, 12, 14. with xiii. 1-6. and that they should tend to the advantage, even of some seducers, who should be brought to account the in∣flicters their real FRIENDS, Zech. xiii. 4, 5, 6. (5) The scripture represents EVIL as removed, and GOOD both moral and civil as obtained, by such restraints and punishments, Deut xvii 2, 5, 7, 10 1 Kings xviii. 40, 41 2 Chron. xiv. 3, 4, 5. and wickedness and misery as overflowing a nation, when neglec∣ted, Eccl. viii. 11. Judg xvii. 4, 5, 6, 12 1 Sam. ii. 12,—29 and iv. Ezek. xxii 25, 26, 30, 31. (6.) When the proper judges neglected such restraint and punishment, God raised up some in an extraordinary way, to execu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e it. Thus Elijah caused slay the pro∣phets of Baal, 1 Kings xviii. 40. Jehu caused slay o∣thers of them, 2 Kings x. 5,—25. The Jews, under the direction of Jehoiada, slew Mattan the priest of Baal, and Christ himself once and again drove the buyers and sellers out of the temple, John ii. 13,—19. Mat. xxi. 12. Why ought not magistrates, who are
<PB N="23" REF="23"/>
his vicegerents, as God, to imitate his conduct, Psal. lxxxii. 1, 6. 2 Chron. xix. 6. Rom. xiii. 1,—4. (7.) The scripture affords many approven instances of such restraint or punishment of gross corruptions in religi∣on, as by Jacob, Gen. xxxv 24 by the judges in the time and country of Job, Job xxxi. 26,—28. by Mo∣ses, Exod. xxxii. 4, 20, 22, 29. by the rulers of the ten tribes, Josh. xxii, 10,—34. by Asa, 2 Chron. xv. 12, 13, 15. by Jehoshaphat, 2 Chron. xix. 3,—8. by Josiah, 2 Chron. xxxiv. 4, 33, 2 Kings xxiii. 5, 20. by Nehemiah, Neh. x. 20. by Nebuchadnezzar, Dan. iii. 29. by Artaxerxes, Ezra vii. 26. and by the Pro∣testant destroyers of Antichrist, Rev. xvii. 16.</P>
<P N="5">V. Beside their power, as men, to try all things by the law of God manifested to them, and their power of Christian discretion (if they are Christians) to judge by the word of God what is for their own spiri∣tual and eternal advantage, magistrates, as such, have a power of POLITICALLY judging and determining, what and how, principles and practices of <HI>the true re∣ligion</HI> are to be connected with political rewards or encouragements; or, what ought to be professed and practised by persons, as members of their political so∣ciety, in order to promote the real welfare of it, in subordination to the glory of God, as King of nati∣ons. (1) If they may enact laws in the matters of God, as hath been proven; and may judge in what is fundamental in religion,—or in that which is con∣tained in express words of scripture,—or in matters of the second table of the moral law,—then they must have power to judge of that which is plainly deducible from the express words of scripture, by necessary con∣sequence,—and in those matters of the first table of the moral law, which as much belong to the law of nature, as any in the second;—have power politi∣cally to judge why, and how, such a religious profes∣sion and practice is to be encouraged by the civil au∣thority; and how, and why, that which is notorious∣ly opposite to the true religion, is to be discouraged. (3.) Without this <HI>political</HI> judging of them, magis∣trates could never determine, Whether the decisions of ecclesiastical courts ought to be ratisied by their ci∣vil authority or not; 1 Thess. v. 21. Acts xvii. 11. If
<PB N="24" REF="24"/>
in judging of those things, magistrates improve the Word, the Spirit, and the faithful ministers of God, for their counsellors, they bid fair to have a <HI>divine sentence in their lips, and not to err in judgment,</HI> Deut. xvii. 18,—20. Psal. cxix. 97,—105. Prov. xvi. 10. Isa, xxxii. 1. If, neglecting to consult these, magis∣trates give a corrupt sentence, they ly open to the judgment of God,—to the restraint and correction of the collective body of the subjects, or their represen∣tatives,—and also to ecclesiastical censure, if they be church-members. (3.) If magistrates be <HI>nursing fa∣thers</HI> to the Christian church, Isa. xlix. 23. they ought to prevent her being poisoned with corrupt food; and hence must have a power <HI>politically</HI> to judge what is corrupt, and what is not. (4.) If the magistrate be the keeper of the peace of the kingdom, then, if a party in the church, complaining of the gross errors of the other, should form a furious schism, he must have power <HI>politically</HI> to judge, who is in the right, or in the wrong—who adhere to the truths established by law, and who do not;—and to shew favour accor∣dingly, 1 Thess. v. 21. (5.) If magistrates may re∣strain and punish evil doers, they may exercise this power over church officers, if, in their Synods, they make blasphemous or idolatrous decrees, which tend to disturb the commonwealth, and dishonour God, the King of nations,—and hence must <HI>politically</HI> judge of their conduct by the laws of God and the land.—No covenanted subjection to church judica∣tures, as a member of the church, can deprive them of this <HI>political</HI> judgment, any more than of their right of <HI>cognition</HI> and <HI>discretion</HI> as men and Christians. Ma∣gistrates <HI>political</HI> judgment, how principles or practi¦ces are to be connected with civil encouragements or discouragements, is no infallible rule of church courts judging, how principles and practices ought to be connected with ecclesiastical encouragements or cen∣sures: nor are the decisions of ecclesiastical courts any infallible rule to direct magistrates. But the law of God is the <HI>only infallible</HI> and <HI>supreme</HI> rule to both. Nor is the decision of the one <HI>subordinate</HI> to that of the other; but both, as well as every man's right to judge for himself according to the law of God, what he is
<PB N="25" REF="25"/>
to believe and practise in order to his own peace and comfort, and his joyful answering in the final judg∣ment of God, are <HI>supreme</HI> in their respective depart∣ments, subordinated only to the judgment of God himself.—But, to argue the matter still more particularly,</P>
<P N="1">1. If magistracy, conscience, and human rights, natural and civil, be all <HI>derived from God,</HI> as all but Atheists must allow, magistrates can have no more power, <HI>authoritatively</HI> to tolerate sin, than God him∣self can command it. If God, by virtue of the infinite perfection of his nature, have no will, no power, <HI>au∣thoritatively</HI> to proclaim liberty to commit sin, he can∣not communicate any such power to the magistrate. Nor can the magistrate account to God for exceeding his power in licensing that which is infinitely injurious to him, more than the British king's Lion-keeper hath power, or could be accountable for loosing and hunt∣ing out the lions in the Tower upon His Majesty. If conscience derive all its power from God, it can have no more power to enjoin any thing sinful, than Lord North hath to hire ruffians to assassinate his Sovereign. If all human rights be derived from God, the prima∣ry and supreme proprietor of all things, it is impossi∣ble they can <HI>authorize</HI> men to contrive or commit any thing sinful, or can <HI>protect</HI> them in it.</P>
<P N="2">2. Mens state in this world is neither <HI>separated</HI> nor <HI>separable</HI> from, but closely connected with their eter∣nal state. And magistracy is an <HI>ordinance of God,</HI> ap∣pointed by him for his own glory, and to promote the chief end of mankind in glorifying him, Rom. xiii. 2. Prov. xvi. 4. 1 Cor. x. 31. 1 Pet. iv. 11. Rom. xii. 36. But, how, Sir, do magistrates promote this end, if they give the same <HI>degree of protection,</HI> though per∣haps, not of encouragement, to the soul-ruining and practice-corrupting delusions and abominations of Satan, as they do the eternally saving religion of God and his Christ?—if they give the same countenance to them, who to the corruption of mens moral beha∣viour, and their eternal damnation,—defame Jeho∣vah to them as <HI>mere matter,</HI> a <HI>mere man,</HI> a <HI>mere crea∣ture,</HI> a <HI>worker of contradiction and nonsense,</HI>—as they do to those, who faithfully proclaim his infinite ex∣cellencies,
<PB N="26" REF="26"/>
and glorious works of redemption, publish his truths, and promote the present and future holi∣ness and happiness of mankind?—If God chiefly aim at the glorifying of himself, in the advancement of the kingdom of Christ; how can magistrates, who are appointed by him, as his vicegerents, for promot∣ing his glory on earth, be allowed, far less obliged by him, to exert their power, as much for protecting or promoting the kingdom of the devil, as for the ad∣vancement of the kingdom of Christ? Indeed magis∣trates are not the deputies of Christ as mediator, but they are of God, Father, Son and Holy Ghost, and all their administrations are, by him, subjected to Christ, as <Q REND="inline">"Head over all things to his church,"</Q> Prov. viii. 15, 16. Mat. xxviii. 18. Eph. i. 22. Why then ought they not to concur with God, in advanc∣ing the kingdom of Christ, especially as this mightily promotes the temporal as well as the eternal welfare of their subjects, Prov. xiv. 34.

<P N="3">3. Magistrates are expresly represented in scripture, <HI>as ministers of God for good to men,</HI>—rulers deputed by, and under him, Rom. xiii. 4. But, how can they be <HI>ministers, deputies,</HI> or <HI>vicegerents</HI> of God, without having power to restrain, and <HI>if proper</HI> and <HI>seasonable,</HI> to punish, that which openly affronts and horridly in∣sults him,—blasphemously gives him the lie, basely misrepresents him, or devotes the worship due to him, to his adversary the devil,—or any other crimes, which immediately strike against him?—If they be God's ministers, they must transact all their magis∣tratical managements in his name,—and how can God empower <HI>his own ministers</HI> as such, and acting in his name, to promote his highest dishonour, licen∣sing, encouraging, and protecting gross heresy, blas∣phemy, and idolatry;—giving as much encourage∣ment to the vilest delusions of Satan, as to the new Testament in Jesus blood?—How can they be mini∣sters of God for good to men, without having power to restrain such as, like wolves and murderers, go a∣bout corrupting the principles and practices, and de∣stroying the sons of his and their subjects? How can
<PB N="27" REF="27"/>
they be ministers of God, the father of spirits, <HI>for good, universal good,</HI> to men, who are not brutes but endowed with precious and immortal souls, which are more, beneficial in commonwealths, than their bodies, without having power to promote the cultivation and welfare of souls as a means of promoting the happi∣ness of that state? How can they be ministers of God <HI>for good to men,</HI> if they have power, only to punish these crimes which strike immediately against their bodies or external property, but no power to punish crimes, as they provoke God's wrath against the na∣tion;—if they have power to restrain the petty thief, robber, or other less hurtful things,—but none to prevent the kindling of God's wrath against the nati∣on, and the debauching of mens consciences and mo∣rals, by blasphemy, heresy, idolatry, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which may quickly do more real mischief to a nation, than ten thousand thieves or robbers could do?—After God hath expresly commanded to punish murderers as <HI>destroyers of his image,</HI> Gen. ix. 6—have his mini∣sters no power to punish murder, as a destruction of his rational creatures, or a sacrificing them to devils, Psal. cvi. 37? If murder ought to be punished as an injury and dishonour to God, why not also public blasphemy, idolatry, and heresy, obstinately continu∣ed in?</P>
<P N="4">4. Magistrates are appointed of God for the <HI>terror</HI> and <HI>punishment of evil doers,</HI> and for the <HI>praise of them that do well,</HI> Rom. xiii. 3, 4. 1 Pet. ii. 14. And are not, Sir, idolaters, blasphemers, profaners of the Sab∣bath, by teaching of damnable errors or practising of abominable idolatries on it, <HI>evil doers</HI> in God's ac∣count, as well as revilers of men, thieves, traitors, murderers, <HI>&amp;c.?</HI> Are not heresies and idolatries ex∣presly declared by him, <HI>damning works of the flesh,—evil deeds,</HI> Gal. v. 14,—21. 2 Thess. ii. 9,—12. Rev. xiv. 9,—11? Are not heretical teachers declared <HI>evil workers,</HI> Phil. iii. 2. Tit: i. 10, 11.—It must there∣fore necessarily follow, that magistrates are appointed by God, not to be licensers, protectors, and encou∣ragers, but to be terrors to, and punishers of them, as is <HI>suitable</HI> and <HI>seasonable.</HI></P>
<P N="5"><PB N="28" REF="28"/>
5. The power, which magistrates have, as <HI>ministers of God for good</HI> to men, ought to be so exercised as most effectually conduceth to make all their subjects live a quiet and peaceable life in all GODLINESS and honesty, and make all men come to the saving know∣ledge of the truth, 1 Tim. ii. 1, 2, 4, But how, Sir, can their <HI>authoritative</HI> allowing or protecting of men in ungodliness, blasphemy, and idolatry, pro∣mote such an end? Hath not God himself testified, that heresies, as well as blasphemy and idolatry, <HI>as a canker,</HI> eat out the doctrine, which is according to godliness, and <HI>increase unto more and more ungodliness,</HI> and make men <HI>worse and worse,</HI> till they be monstrous∣ly wicked, 2 Tim. ii. 16, 17. iv. 3, 4. iii. 1,—9, 13. 2 Thess. ii. 3,—12. 1 Tim. iv. 1,—3. vi. 3, 4 2 Pet. ii. 1,—3, 10,—20. Rom. i. 21,—32. If magistrates protect and encourage obstinate seducers in blasphem∣ing God, reproaching his Son as a mere creature, or as an impostor, or in furiously rending his well com∣pacted body the church, or in corrupting the princi∣ples and morals, and ruining the souls of neighbours, children, or servants, how can such as are truly se∣rious and ardently zealous for God, fail to have their righteous souls vexed from day to day, with the dam∣nable doctrines and filthy conversation of these wick∣ed? Psal. cxix. 136, 139, 158. lxix. 9. 2 Pet. ii. 8.—To truly zealous saints, a <HI>den of thieves,</HI> is not a more grievous neighbour than a <HI>Synagogue of Sa∣tan.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. All magistrates ruling over men, must <HI>be just, ruling in the fear of the Lord,</HI> 2 Sam. xxiii. 3. But how can they be <HI>just,</HI> if they dispose of <HI>that protection</HI> or <HI>encouragement,</HI> to that which dishonours and provokes God to the highest, saps the foundation of all true virtue, and natively produces the most ruinous prac∣tices,—<HI>which is due</HI> to that doctrine, worship, and practice, which is <HI>according to godliness,</HI> and promotes glory, honour, immortality, eternal life? How can they rule <HI>in the fear of God,</HI> if, in their magistratical administrations, they shew no regard to that religion, by which his declarative glory is advanced, but instead thereof, license, protect, and encourage, that which infinitely dishonours and offends him?</P>
<P N="7"><PB N="29" REF="29"/>
7. The fourth commandment, the obligation of which is certainly moral, and <HI>perpetually binding</HI> on magistrates, as well as on heads of families, commands them to cause the weekly Sabbath to be sanctified by all <HI>within their gates,</HI> i. e. all their subjects, Exod. xx. 10. Jer. xvii. 20,—25. And to this the approven example of Nehemiah corresponds, Neh. xiii. 15,—22. Now, if magistrates cannot answer to God, for en∣couraging or protecting their subjects in their <HI>civil bu∣siness,</HI> which is of itself lawful and useful,—on the the Sabbath,—how will they account to him, for pro∣tecting and encouraging men, in teaching <HI>blasphemous errors,</HI> or practising <HI>abominable idolatries,</HI> on that day? How can this commandment bind them to restrain what is in itself lawful and useful,—and yet bind them not to restrain, but <HI>allow, encourage,</HI> and <HI>protect,</HI> that which is in itself infinitely dishonourable to God, their superior, and ruinous to his and their subjects, in both temporal and eternal interests?—Or, dare you pretend, that the observance of the weekly Sab∣bath depends one whit less on Revelation, than the doctrine of the Trinity of persons in the Godhead doth.</P>
<P N="8">8. If magistrates have power, on proper occasions, to appoint <HI>religious fasts,</HI> as means of turning away God's wrath, and of procuring or obtaining his bles∣sings to their commonwealth, as it is certain yourself, and perhaps every advocate for <HI>authoritative toleration,</HI> acknowledge, Jonah iii. 6,—10. 1 Sam. vii. 9, 6. 2 Chron. xx. 3,—15. Ezra viii. 21,—33. Neh. ix. 1. Jer. xxxvi. 6, 22. they cannot but have power to e∣stablish that religion, and <HI>only that religion</HI> which an∣swers to those ends, and to restrain that damnable he∣resy, blasphemy, and idolatry, which provoke God's wrath against his subjects. To command their sub∣jects to mourn over the grounds of his anger and sup∣plicate his favour, while at the same time they encou∣raged and protected them in gross heresy, public blas∣phemy and idolatry, than which nothing can more provoke his indignation, would be fearful dissimu∣lation with the Most High. Psalm lxvi. 18. Ezek. xiv. 3,—8, If magistrates have power to appoint a Christian fast, and to punish the public contemners
<PB N="30" REF="30"/>
of it, or of their authority, in appointing it,—How can they but have power to establish the true Christi∣an religion, and to punish, <HI>if seasonable,</HI> the public and insolent contemners and corrupters of it, and despi∣sers of their authority in establishing it?—Dare you pretend, that the upright profession and practice of the Christian religion is less calculated to promote the happiness of a nation in subordination to the honour of God, than an occasional fast? Or, that a Christian fast can be observed without entering into the very marrow of the doctrines of Revelation?—or that ma∣gistrates ought merely to require the day to be obser∣ved in fasting, leaving the manner and object of the worship, wholly to the choice of their subjects,—recom∣mending the worship of devils, as much as that of Je∣hovah; and supposing the one as able and ready to avert calamities, and bestow necessary blessings, as the other. If you pretend, that God rewarded Ahab or the Nine∣vites for worshipping their idols, you must prove that God is so far from being highly displeased with ido∣latry, as himself often declares, Deut. xxxii. 16, 17, 21,—26. Judges ii. 14. 2 Kings xvii. 10,—18. Psalm cvi. 19,—40 Jer. xlviii. 7, 35, l. 38, <HI>&amp;c.—</HI>that he is ready to accept and reward the worship of idols, de∣vils, bulls, dogs, cats, saints, leeks, onions, conse∣crated wafers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> if men be sincere in it. Rare doctrine this, for a Presbyterian clergyman, of this <HI>enlightened age!</HI></P>
<P N="9">9. If every parent or master ought for the welfare of his family, in subordination to the honour of the God of all families, to establish the true religion in it, Gen. xviii. 19. Josh. xxiv. 15 to remove idols out of it, G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n. xxxv. 2,—4. and to refuse seducing he∣reties a lodging in it, 2 John x. 11.—And if accor∣ding to this injunction, and those approved examples, he ought to extrude a seducer, who had entered: or even a member of the family, who obstinately en∣deavoured to corrupt the rest, with damnable error, blasphemy, or idolatry,—in order to prevent the in∣fection of the family, and hinder the destructive wrath of God from falling on them;—Why must not ma∣gistrates, who are <HI>God's ministers for good,</HI> be allowed
<PB N="31" REF="31"/>
power and authority to establish and promote the true Christian religion, in their <HI>large political families,</HI> and to repress or exclude notorious murderers of souls, and kindlers of the wrath of God? The relation of a parent or master is <HI>no more spiritual,</HI> than that of a magistrate, makes no man either member or officer of Christ's mystical body, any more than magistracy doth.—And I dare defy all the Tolerants on earth, to point out one thing relative to religion, competent to masters and parents, as such, but magistrates may do what is similar; or to prove that the true know∣ledge, faith, profession and practice of revealed religi∣on, is one whit less necessary and useful in common∣wealths, than in families.</P>
<P N="10">10. If the power of ecclesiastical rulers extends to all the <HI>civil transactions</HI> of <HI>church-members,</HI>—all the <HI>ma∣gistratical</HI> and <HI>military managements</HI> of kings or empe∣rors not excepted, in so far as they are regulated by the law of Christ, and are immediately connected with his honour and the good of his church,—there is e∣qual reason, that the power of magistrates should ex∣tend to religious matters, in so far as they are con∣nected with the welfare of the state, in subordination to the honour of God, as King of nations. No rea∣son can be assigned, why the vicegerents of God should, as such, act as atheists, regardless of religion, any more than the messengers of Christ. Nor, till it be proven, that God, the King of nations, is more inclined to damnable heresy, blasphemy, and idola∣latry, than Christ the Head of the church, can it be possible to prove, that magistrates have one whit more power, <HI>authoritatively</HI> to license, encourage, or pro∣mise them protection, than church-rulers have;—though as the church is a <HI>select holy society,</HI> called out of the world which lieth in wickedness, founded on, and having all her adult members instructed by the revelation of Christ, the same degree of forbearance to censure, in the church, as to punish in the state, is by no means proper.</P>

They render times perilous, and men cove∣tous, boasters, proud, disobedient to parents, un∣thankful, unholy, without natural affection, truce-breakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce despisers, and extirpaters of those that are good, traitors, hea∣dy, high-minded, hypocritical, dissemblers, villain∣ous, corrupters of families, haters and resisters of sound doctrine, reprobate concerning the faith, and waxing worse and worse;—who will not endure sound doctrine, but after their own lusts, heap up to them∣selves teachers, having itching ears, and turn away their ears from the truth to fables, 2 Tim. iii. 1,—8, 13. iv. 3, 4. They, as a canker, eat out the princi∣ples, profession and practice of piety and virtue, and increase unto more ungodliness, 2 Tim. ii. 16, 17.—They make men self destroyers,—their pernicious ways much followed,—the way of truth reproached, and dispose them through covetousness with feigned words to make damnable merchandise of souls; they render men horridly unchaste, presumptuous, self∣willed, despisers and revilers of magistrates and church rulers, beguilers of unstable souls, exercised in cove∣tous practices, cursed children,—speakers of great

swelling words of vanity, pretenders to liberty, but real slaves of corruption, 2 Pet. ii. 1,—3, 10,—19.—They render men ungodly turners of the grace of God into lasciviousness,—filthy dreamers, who defile the flesh, despise dominions, and speak evil of digni∣ties,—blasphemers and calumniators of those things which they know not, who go in the unnatural and maliciously murderous way of Cain, run greedily af∣ter the error of Balaam for reward, and perish in the rebellious gainsaying of Kore,—and are luxurious, unprofitable,—raging waves of the sea, foaming out their own shame,—wandering stars, to whom is reserved the blackness of darkness for ever:—men of ungodly deeds and hard speeches,—murmu∣rers, complainers, walkers after their own lusts, whose mouth speaketh great swelling words, having mens persons in admiration, because of advantage,—sensual and separating mockers, who walk after their ungod∣ly lusts, Jude iv. 8, 10,—13, 15, 16, 10, 19.—They render persons and societies full of abominati∣ons and filthiness of fornication—a mystery of iniqui∣ty, and mother of harlots and abominations in the earth,—drunk with the blood of the saints and martyrs of Jesus,—fighters against Him, who is LORD of Lords, and pretendedly conscientious murderers of his ministers and people, Rev. xvii. 3,—6, 14. John xvi. 2. In fine, they introduce unnatural lusts of the flesh, and tend to fill men with all unrighteous∣ness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, malici∣outness, envy, murder, debates, deceit, malignity, and make them whisperers, backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventers of evil things, disobedient to parents, without understanding, cove∣nant breakers, without natural affection, implacable unmerciful,—who, contrary to their own inward convictions, commit the most abominable crimes, and have pleasure in them that do the like, Rom. i, 21,—23.—These, Sir, if God do know and speak truth, are the native fruits of heresy, blasphemy and idola∣try,—these the GOOD SUBJECTS, who are infected with them,—if Providence permit them to reduce their principles to practice.

<P N="12">12.

<P N="13">13.

<P N="16">16. Even the law of nature plainly requires, That magistrates maintain and promote the honour of that God, who gave them all their power and authority,—that God, who is the original and supreme proprie∣tor and Sovereign of nations and societies, and the all-sufficient source of all their happiness;—that they govern their subjects, not as if they were dogs

or swine, having nothing but their bodies to care for, but as men endowed with rational and immortal souls;—that as righteousness exalteth a nation, and sin is the reproach of any people, they should exercise their whole power and authority, as is best calculated to make all their subjects behave most agreeably to the law, and declarative glory of God, and most usefully to each other.—It plainly teacheth, That if God graciously grant us a <HI>supernatural revelation,</HI> directive of our faith, profession and practice, we ought thank∣fully to receive, believe, profess and obey it;—that, if magistrates ought to restrain and punish gross im∣moralities, they ought to restrain that error or wor∣ship, which, being a manifestly damning work of the flesh, natively leads men into such immoralities;—and that, if heresy, blasphemy and idolatry hinder the progress of virtue, or the increase of good men, who are the principal support and blessings of a society, Isa. vi. 13. lxv. 8. Gen. xviii. 26, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32. they ought to be restrained.—If heresy, blasphe∣my and idolatry established or authoritatively tolerat∣ed, eminently and notoriously provoke God to punish nations with sword, famine, pestilence, poverty, de∣cay of trade, desolation, captivity, or the like, as they have often done even among Heathens, Common sense requires, That every magistrate, from regard to the welfare of his subjects, ought to restrain them, as far as his circumstances can prudently permit,—instead of giving them as much liberty, encouragement or protection as he gives to the religion of Jesus Christ, which hath the promises of this life, and of that which is to come, 1 Tim. iv. 8, Titus iii. 8, 14.

<P N="17">17. If, Sir, as you pretend, magistrates ought to tolerate heresy, idolatry and blasphemy,—then, a pow∣er and office derived from God ought to be employed and executed in encouraging the most shocking dis∣honours and outrage against him;—the authority of God, placed in, and exercised by, magistrates, ought to be set in opposition to his own <HI>immediate</HI> authority, manifested in his word;—they as <HI>ministers of God for good</HI> to men, ought to license and encourage his ene∣mies to deny, pervert, and revile his truths contained

God is the only absolute, supreme and infallible Lawgiver; He alone hath power to constitute any thing a part of religion. But that no more hinders his magistratical vicegerents to make <HI>political</HI> laws in favours of what he hath de∣clared and instituted in religion, than Christ being Head of the church can hinder her subordinate rulers to make ecclesiastical constitutions in favours of the truth, in his name, Psalm lxxxii. 1, 6. Rom. xiii. 1,—6. 1 Fet. ii. 13, 14. 2. Neither magistrates nor mi∣nisters can make any law which of themselves, and as their deeds, bind mens conscience. Their authority is not infallibly exercised; it doth not reach to the inward actings of conscience. They cannot oblige conscience to these actings, or take any cognizance of them. They cannot free it from any guilt contracted by them, or reward it if it doth well, or punish or censure it if it doth amiss. Nor are their constituti∣ons, but God's law, the standard by which it shall be judged at the last day.—But they may make laws or constitutions, which, as originating from, subordi∣nated to, and adopted and ratisied by the law of God. bind men to obey for conscience sake, Rom. xiii. 1,—4. Mat. xviii. 19. 3. God's being the only Lawgiver of men under the Old Testament as much as now, did not hinder Moses, David, Asa, Jehoshaphat, He∣zekiah, Josiah, Nehemiah, Nebuchadnezzar the Chal∣dean, Darius the Mede, Cyrus, Darius, and Artaxer∣xes, Persians, or the king of Nineveh to make civil laws in favours of the true religion. 4. If God alone be the Lawgiver and Lord of the conscience, it nece∣ssarily follows, that magistrates and conscience, who are his deputies, can have no power to warrant, li∣cense or protect, any thing forbidden by his law, 2 Cor. xiii 8, 10.</P>
<P>OBJECT. II. <Q REND="inline">"Every man hath a natural right to judge for himself, what he ought to do or forbear, especially in religion.

<PB N="40" REF="40"/>
any man to do any thing contrary to his conscience, is to force him to sin, for whatsoever is not of saith is sin; and to punish him for following the dictates of his conscience is to punish him for doing his duty."</Q> ANSW. [1.] Already you have made mens consci∣ence the supreme governor of their actions, exalting it above The Most High GOD. [2.] Every man hath a natural right derived from God, to <HI>judge all things by the law of God, and hold fast that which is good,</HI> 1 Thess. v. 21. He hath a right to judge by the law of God what is necessary to be professed and practised, in order to the peace of his conscience, and his fellow∣ship with, and receiving of favours from God. But that no more hinders magistrates <HI>politically</HI> to judge what profession and practice are proper for men, as members of such a particular commonwealth,—or what relative to religion is to be connected with civil encouragements or discouragements,—than it hinders church-rulers, ecclesiastically to judge and define what profession or practice is necessary, in order to comfortable fellowship with such a particular church. [3.] Mens conscience is no Lawgiver at all, but a <HI>witness</HI> of their conduct, and a <HI>judge,</HI> which enquires into the meaning of God's law, and directs according∣ly,—and which compares their qualities, profession, and practice with the law of God, and if faithful, approves or disapproves accordingly. [4.] The law of God, not men's conscience, is their <HI>supreme and on∣ly insallible rule,</HI> which binds even conscience itself, Mark xii. 30. 1 John v. 3. and whatever men do con∣trary to it, is sinful, let their conscience approve it as much as they will, 1 John iii. 4. Lev. v. 17, 18. Acts xxvi. 9. 10. 1 Tim i. 13,—16. Whatever pro∣ceeds not from the persuasion of a good conscience, founded on the word of God, is sin. It is a sin for mens conscience to err in dictating any thing not per∣fectly agreeable to the law of God.—How absurd to pretend, that this fin can render another sin duty, or a duty sinful in itself! [5] If mens conscience, in itself, or in its directing, persuading or instigating influence be sustained, as the immediate rule of their conduct, without respect to the word of God, then either their conscience must be <HI>insallible</HI> in its dictates,
<PB N="41" REF="41"/>
which it certainly is not, in either saints or sinners, in this world, Rom. vii. 14, 23. Prov. xxviii. 26. Jer. xvii 9. Rom. viii. 7, 8. Tit. i. 15. or, if it be <HI>fallible,</HI> God must have established for men a <HI>fallible</HI> and <HI>de∣ceitful rule</HI> of <HI>truth</HI> and <HI>holiness,</HI>—and so be the author of confusion in religion, since different consciences dictate different things in it.—To make mens con∣science their rule in religion, would make God the au∣thor and commander of wickedness,—by conscience, requiring the transgression of his own law.—It would make him not only acquit from criminality, but ap∣prove as duty, the most damnable errors, horrid blasphe∣mies, detestable abominations, and cruel barbarities, if but dictated by the consciences of Heathens, Maho∣tans, Papists, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in their religion.—It would make him the author of mens ruin, if it were procured by a way which seemed right in their own eyes, Prov. xvi. 25.—It would render it absolutely impossible to convince men of the sinfulness of any thing they had done according to the dictates of their conscience, be it ever so contrary to the law of God. It would ren∣der it improper for men to repent of or mourn over any blasphemy, murder of saints, or the like, which their deluded conscience had dictated to them, or to ask, receive, or praise God for the pardoning of it, contrary to 1 Tim. i. 13,—16. with Acts xxvi. 9,—11. Gal. i. 13, 14. Phil. iii. 6. It would open a wide gap for mens doing whatever they pleased, without being chargeable by, at least any man, for it—If men should be executed for the most horrid blasphemy, or abo∣minable idolatry, high treason, or any other deed dic∣tated by their conscience, they would die martyrs for righteousness sake.—And men ought to believe what∣ever their conscience dictated to them concerning their state, experience or duty, however contrary to the testimony of God, contained in his word,—contrary to Psalm iii. 22. &amp; xvi 11. xlii. 5, 11. Rev. iii. 17. [6.] To pretend that the law of God, not in itself, but <HI>as understood by mens conscience,</HI> is their rule, is absurd. It, in the Popish manner, represents the law of God as destitute of sense and authority in itself, and as deriving it from a creature. It, in the Quake∣rish manner, makes the <HI>light within</HI> the rule of mens
<PB N="42" REF="42"/>
conduct. It exalts every man to an equality with, or rather superiority above God, having power to give regulating sense and authority to his word, ac∣cording as an erroneous and defiled conscience pleas∣eth. It abolisheth every real standard of religion, eve∣ry man's particular apprehensions of the meaning of God's word being his binding rule. The same word of God becomes the standard of <HI>Calvinism, Popery, Socinianism,</HI> &amp;c. as different men understand it. It saps the foundation of all mutual trust and confidence among men; and opens a wide inlet for all manner of villany and dissimulation. According to it, mens pro∣mises, oaths, vows, and covenants,—their sworn and subscribed Creeds, Articles, Confessions, Formulas, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> bind them, not according to the common mean∣ing of the words,—but according to the meaning which their conscience, however seared, biassed, or deluded, puts upon them. In fine, it plunges men into the depths of Atheism, according to which every man be∣lieves and acts what is right in his own eyes. [7] If mens private judgment of their own acts hindered the magistrates supreme <HI>political</HI> judgment, no laws could be made in matters of religion or any thing else; as some would be readily of a different mind, even in the fundamentals of religion and virtue.—While some believed that Christ was not true God or true man, or that idols might be worshipped, others would believe that oaths might be lawfully violated, heretical princes assassinated, or women and goods used in com∣mon. [8.] If other mens private judgment be allow∣ed to be their supreme rule and reason of conduct, it will necessarily follow, that magistrates private judg∣ment must be the rule of their conduct; and that they ought to make and execute such laws as they believe in their own heart to be proper, be they as ar∣bitrary and tyrannical as they will. [9.] It is not with mens conscience, and its judgment in religion, any more than in matters of common honesty, that ma∣gistratical authority intermeddles, but with their ex∣ternal words and deeds. It only restrains and punish∣eth such of those as are <HI>manifestly contrary to the laws of God and the land,</HI> and <HI>as they are hurtful to the com∣monwealth,</HI>
<PB N="43" REF="43"/>
and <HI>the public honour of God as King of na∣tions.</HI> [10.] If all proper means of conviction be us∣ed with men who obstinately persist in gross heresy, blasphemy, and idolatry without effect; their mistake doth not arise from a conscience regulating duty, but from one stiffened against duty. And it is perhaps sometimes as difficult to convince a hardened thief, robber, or adulterer of his mistake, as it is to convince a hardened heretic. Men are punishable, not for what their conscience, as the deputy of God, dictates, but for what they would not have done, if they had any proper conscience of duty. [11.] If men sloth∣fully and especially wilfully refuse to use the means of ealightening their conscience by the word of God, they but add to their crimes both before God and men, by pretending conscience. [12.] Mens conscience being as much a director in their conduct towards men, as in their conduct towards God, its influence must have as much force to keep them from accountableness <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> men, for their theft, murder, calumny, as for their gross heresy, blasphemy and idolatry.</P>
<P>OBJECT.

(2) If so, church rulers being men, as well as magistrates, their restraints and censures, appointed by Christ himself, must as much render Christians <HI>servants of men,</HI>—Nay to comply with the religious orders of families, would make them <HI>servants of men.</HI> (3.) Servilely to comply with the vain fancies, humours, sinful lusts or laws of men, particularly in religion, is to be the <HI>ser∣vants</HI> of men in the sense of this text: but to comply with scriptural restraints, censures, or punishments of wickedness, is to act as <HI>servants of Christ,</HI> and his Father and Spirit.</P>

Christian charity rejoiceth <HI>not in iniquity,</HI> but rejoic∣eth <HI>in the truth.</HI> It requires that nothing should be done out of malice or envy, or rashly on bare surmi∣ses, or without due examination of facts and circum∣stances, but not that rulers, either of church or state, should overlook every scandal or crime contrary to the law of God. Even the undue delay of censure or punishment encourageth men in wickedness, much more would the total overlooking of it, Eccl. viii. 11. (2.) The texts quoted in the objection, are directed to Christians and church-rulers. Is therefore all their holy zeal and activity in restraining and censuring the corrupters of the church, according to Christ's com∣mand, Rev. ii Rom. xvi. 17. Gal. v. 10. Tit. iii. 10. 1 Tim i. 20—contrary to Christian charity, meekness, or mercifulness? Had Moses quite abandoned his un∣paralelled meekness, when he so zealously punished the Hebrew idolaters, Num. xxxii. 3. with Exod. xxxii. 26,—29? Was Jesus Christ destitute of all meekness and mercy, when he appointed the restraints and pe∣nalties under the old Testament; and at least the tre∣menduous censure of excommunication under the new? Was he destitute of all charity, meekness and mercy, in never giving us a hint that these laws are now repealed, as having been cruel and tyrannical? Was he desti∣tute of all charity, meekness and mercy, when the zeal of his Father's house did eat him up,—when he repea∣tedly drove the buyers and sellers from the temple, John ii. 13,—19.

It is blasphemous to pretend, that the gospel-dispensation allows any more liberty to fin, than the legal did. Must the grace of God be turned into lasciviousness? Jude, ver. 4. Gal. v. 13. (2.) To prevent worse consequences, Moses directed a deliberate and solemn manner of divorce, which ten∣ded to render divorces less frequent or irregular, but never warranted divorce for slight causes.

<PB N="45" REF="45"/>
you cannot prove, that the perpetual continu∣ance of marriage relation flows as necessarily from the nature of God, as gross heresy, blasphemy, and ido∣latry are contrary to it; God therefore might sovereign∣ly dispense with the one, though not with the other.

These texts import, that quarrelsome dispositions, and inju∣rious slaughter of men should be remarkably restrain∣ed, by the gospel; but not that magistrates should no more <HI>bear the sword,</HI> or be <HI>terrors</HI> to, and <HI>punishers</HI> of evil doers, Rom. xiii. 1,—6. 1 Pet. ii. 13, 14;—they no more import, that magistrates should not restrain or <HI>seasonably</HI> or <HI>suitably</HI> punish blasphemy and idola∣try, than that they should not restrain theft or mur∣der. (2) The restraint or punishment we plead for, being God's institution, cannot hurt, but profit men,

making many fear, and avoid such horrible wicked∣ness. Deut. xvii. 10; nay, sometimes do much good to the restrained and punished persons, Zech. xiii. 6. (3.) If heretics, blasphemers and idolaters be as mis∣chievous persons, as above described from the oracles of God, the restraint of them is a necessary mean to secure the peace of nations and churches.

If it were a command, it is given to church rulers rather than to magistrates, and so might, with more apparent propriety, be pled in favours of ecclesiastical toleration of heretics, ido∣laters, blasphemers. (3) If these <HI>tares</HI> mean only hypocrites, who have a visible appearance of holiness or innocency, we plead, that neither magistrates nor ministers ought to attempt plucking them up.

IX. <Q REND="inline">"By rebuking his disciples, who would have commanded fire from heaven to consume those Samaritans who refused him lodging in his way to Jerusalem; and by his declaring, That he came <HI>not to destroy mens lives, but to save</HI> them, Luke ix. 51,—56. our benevolent Saviour plainly intimated, That under the gospel, magistrates ought to lay no restraint on heresy, blasphemy or idolatry."</Q> ANSW. (1.) As these Samaritans did not live under magistrates or laws, which established the true religion, it is not pled, that even their gross heresy, blasphemy, or ido∣latry, however notorious and obstinate, could have been regularly punishable by men. (2) They were in this matter guilty of no heresy, blasphemy or idolatry,—or of attempting to seduce or disturb Christ or his dis∣ciples,—but merely of not giving lodging to a mean∣like Jew, of whose Messiahship they had but little, if any information or proof. (3.) Though the Samari∣tans
<PB N="47" REF="47"/>
had been guilty of gross heresy, blasphemy and ido∣latry, publicly and obstinately professed and practised, contrary to the civil laws of the country, and been re∣gularly punishable,—Christ's disciples being no ma∣gistrates in that place, had no right to call them to ac∣count. (4.) The disciples never sought to have the contempt shown to themselves and their Master pu∣nished by the civil law, but by the <HI>miraculous vengeance of God.</HI> Without any warrant from God, and to gra∣tify their own proud, passionate, and revengeful tem∣per, they would have required him to work a miracle for the destruction of these poor ignorant Samaritans.—So, if you will drag in this text, it ought to be to prove, That neither God nor ministers ought to restrain heretics, blasphemers, or idolaters. (5.) While Christ was in his debased state, obeying and suffering for the salvation of mankind, it would have been extremely improper for God, visibly to punish every slight put upon him. But his coming to <HI>save men</HI> with an everlasting salvation, can no more infer, that he came to protect criminals from just punish∣ment by men, than that he came to save obstinate un∣believers from hell. He came to <HI>save mens lives,</HI> by saving them from their sins, not by protecting and warranting them in a public and obstinate commission of them. There is no hint in scripture, that he, who was manifested to destroy the works of the devil, came to procure men a liberty of conscience, or a ma∣gistratical licence or protection in public and gross heresy, blasphemy, and idolatry, more than in theft, murder, adultery. It would be highly blasphemous to suppose it.</P>

(1.) We must never rashly or uncharitably judge others, or judge their hearts and intentions, which God alone knoweth. But that will no more infer, that magistrates ought to give no judg∣ment

It re∣quires no small share of <HI>ignorance, impudence</HI> and <HI>fraud,</HI> to insinuate that the many thousands of Pro∣testant advocates for the magistrates power to restrain gross heresy, blasphemy or idolatry, plead for the FOR∣CING of men to faith and holiness, when they so har∣moniously plead for the contrary. (2) None ought to be forced into the faith and profession of the true religion, as hath been repeatedly declared, but all proper methods taken to render their compliance ju∣dicious and voluntary. Yet that will not infer, that no man ought to be restrained from, or even <HI>suitably</HI> and <HI>seasonably</HI> punished for, open and gross heresy, blasphemy or idolatry, which, while they publicly op∣pose, insult, and undermine the true religion,—pro∣duce terrible immoralities and disorders in churches and nations, and draw upon them the ruinous ven∣geance of God;—and far less will it infer, that ma∣gistrates, as vicegerents of God, ought, in his name and authority, to <HI>license</HI> a false religion, and promise men protection and encouragement in it No magis∣trate hath power to force me to esteem, love, delight in, sympathize with, maintain, or even commend my neighbour. But he hath power to refuse me a warrant to calumniate, rob or murder him, and even
<PB N="49" REF="49"/>
to restrain or punish me for so doing. It would be absurd to attempt forcing of the British Jacobites, to believe and solemnly profess, that K.

But would it therefore be absurd, to restrain and punish them for publicly and insolently reviling him as an u∣surper,—or seducing their fellow subjects to dethrone him,—or for taking arms against him, or paying his just revenues to the Pretender? (3) It is certain, that Christ, who hath power over the hearts of all men, curbed the external corruptions of the Jewish buyers and sellers in the temple, without first casting the corruptions out of their heart.

(1.) Did not God under the Old Testament, know the conquering power of his truth as well as you do? Did not Christ know it when he drove the buyers and sellers from the temple. (2) Did the inexpressibly amiable and edifying conduct of Jesus Christ, the way, the truth and the life, render him the universal, the fixed DARLING of the Jewish nation, among whom he went about doing good? You dare not pretend it. And yet it is certain that examples do more affect than instructions. (3) You must not only, with Pelagi∣ans, deny original sin, but effectually disprove it, be∣fore your objection can have any sense in it.—While men are so blinded by Satan and their own lusts, and so full of enmity against God, they cannot but be much more disposed to receive and practise error, than to discern, embrace, and practise gospel-truths, however clearly and faithfully preached, 1 Cor. ii. 14.

The common experience of every one, who attempt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to instruct children and servants in the truths of God, even when they are young, and their minds most un∣biassed, irrefragably demonstrates, that almost any thing is more readily embraced than the plain truths of the gospel; and that earnest prayers, serious admo∣nitions, external encouragements, and Christian nur∣ture, have all enough, and too often more than e∣nough of work, to make men learn them. (5.) If pro∣fessed Christians, by encouraging others in gross error and wickedness, provoke God to give up themselves to strong delusions, that they may believe lies, will the native lustre of divine truths then enlighten and cap∣tivate them?

Few of those boasted <HI>glorious desenders of Christianity</HI> are real and thorough friends to the gospel of Christ, but often proceed upon the Arminian, and sometimes the Socinian scheme, the last of which is as bad, if not worse, than Heathenism itself.—And, it is certain, that TENS, if not HUNDREDS, have been seduced by deistical publications, for every ONE, that has been been converted from Deism by almost all these defences of the Christian religion.</P>
<P>OBJECT. XIII. <Q REND="inline">"Christ hath appointed for his church, rulers of her own, who govern her in every duty of religion."</Q> ANSW. (1.) This can no more prove, that magistrates ought to make and execute no laws respecting the duties required by the first table of the moral law, than it will prove that they ought to make no laws respecting duties of the second table,—since church-rulers are as much authorized by God to govern, in the one as in the other. Let magistrates and church-rulers be allowed to govern their distinct departments in their different manner, in the very same things, and nothing but harmony, order and advantage will ensue. (2.)

The state, which also hath a power in itself sufficient to gain all its ends, ne∣cessary to promote its own welfare, ought therefore to restrain or punish such transgressions <HI>as crimes</HI> inju∣rious to itself, while the church restrains and censures them as <HI>scandals</HI> defiling and hurtful to herself. (3.) If soundness in the faith, purity in worship, holiness in practice, and beautiful order in the church, be an excellent mean of promoting the happiness of that na∣tion, where the church hath her residence, magis∣trates ought to promote those things, out of a regard to the prosperity of their state, in subordination to the honour of God. (4.) However complete the in∣trinsic power of the church be, it is manifest, that it can be exercised to more advantage, if parents, mas∣ters, and magistrates regularly exert their power in promoting the true religion, in their different departments.—It is no less certain, that after the church hath done her utmost, by conference, in∣junction and censure, some turbulent heretics or blas∣phemers may do as much, if not more, hurt to her than before, unless magistrates restrain or punish them.</P>

It was proper, that the Christian religion should be spread in the world, not only with∣out the countenance of the civil magistrate, but also in opposition to his severe laws and bloody persecuti∣ons, that it might the more abundantly appear to be of God.

Will you therefore plead, that peace and freedom in preaching the gospel ought to be hated and avoided, and furi∣ous persecution coveted and prayed for? (3) In that period, the miraculous powers, which attested the doctrines of Christ did more than balance the want of magistratical helpfulness to the truth, Heb. ii 4.—(4.) In that period, the hardships to which Christians were exposed, deterred such naughty persons from entering the church, as might have plagued her with their blasphemies and heresies.

(1.) Where is your proof, from either scripture or rea∣son, that an erring conscience binds men to believe, teach or practise, gross heresy, blasphemy or idolatry, any more than their promises or vows to do evil, bind to performance?—or than it can bind them to theft, murder, adultery, calumny, or the like?—If we

have an erring conscience, our immediate duty is to get rid of that error, by the illumination of God's word, as being sinful in itself, especially if procured through sloth or wickedness; it will hinder our right performance of duty, but can never make fin lawful. If, Sir, you can believe, that an erring conscience, can outdo the almighty power of God, in making he∣resy, blasphemy, or idolatry innocent things, you may quickly believe, that a Romist priest can outdo his Maker, in making a God, and then eating him, in the mystery of transubstantiation. (2.) Even when conscience is perfectly clear, pure and unbiassed, it is wholly subordinated and subjected to the authority of God's law.—How can the entrance of sinful error into it, exalt it above his law, and make such a God of it, as can stamp its wicked dictates into incontroulable laws, in opposition to the mandates of Jehovah him∣self.—This will not only prove, that Adam and Eve became Gods by the entrance of fin, but go far to justify Popes and devils in the whole of their conduct. (3.) If the devil, who deceiveth the world, get into mens conscience by his strong delusions, hath God allotted him that as a quiet city of refuge, from which no means ought to be used to dislodge him, and from which he may use the whole man unrestrained in his service,—in sacrificing children to Moloch, murder∣ing saints, blaspheming God, <HI>&amp;c.?</HI> (4.) Where is your proof, that I ought to believe, that the man, who hath access to the Bible, acts according to the dictates of his conscience in gross heresy, blasphemy or idola∣try, any more than that he acts according to them, in murder, treason, theft, unchastity, <HI>&amp;c.?</HI> Men have laboured and suffered as much, in courses of the latter kind, as in those of the former, and died as im∣penitently at last. (5.) If pretence of conscience, and more than pretence in favours of sin we can never be certain of, be a sufficient ground for magistrates licensing, encouraging and protecting men in contra∣dicting and blaspheming God, or robbing him of his worship, to bestow it on devils,—or in robbing his church of his oracles or ordinances,—in murdering the souls of men, and sowing the seeds of confusion and every evil work,—Why ought it not to warrant

their licensing, encouraging and protecting them in high treason, calumny, theft, robbery, murder?—It is hoped, you, who are so generous in allowing men, if they can but pretend conscience for it, to a∣bused and rob Jehovah, will be as ready to allow them equal freedom, if they can but pretend conscience, in abusing and injuring yourself. If God's giving up men to <HI>strong delusions,</HI> that they may believe lies warrant magistrates to encourage or protect them, in spreading gross heresy, or in open blasphemy and idolatry, Why ought not his giving them up to <HI>vile affections,</HI>—to their own hearts lusts, equally to warrant their encou∣raging and protecting of them in open whoredom, be∣stiality, incest, robbery, <HI>&amp;c.?</HI> Men can as little con∣quer their lusts and cleanse their hearts, as they can rectify the errors of their conscience. (6.) It is infal∣libly certain, that God himself, under the Old Tes∣tament appointed magistrates to restrain and punish men for blasphemy and idolatry, let their conscience dictate them as strongly as it pleased.—Had men in these early ages no conscience to govern them?

If the use∣ful laws of one nation, may be adopted into the civil law of another, Why may not the will of God, the supreme governor of nations, declared in his laws of nature and revelation, be also adopted into it? Are God's laws more dishonourable or dangerous,—more unfit to be adopted into our civil law, than those of our sinful neighbours? Is the Scotch law the worse, that many of God's statutes, prescribed in his word, have been adopted into it,—nay, that all the leading doctrines of Christianity contained in our two Confes∣sions of Faith and Catechisms have been adopted into it, and the Confessions themselves expresly ingrossed into acts of Parliament?—Indeed, if nations adopt no∣thing of the manifested will of God, into their civil law, it will contain nothing but useless trifles.

<PB N="58" REF="58"/>
Jewish nation also exercised laws relative to murder, theft, unchastity, treason, and other matters of the second table of the moral law. Ought therefore no magistrates now to do so? The laws respecting duties of the second table pertained as much to the Jewish Theocracy, as those relating to the first. Must there∣fore the Christian magistrate, for fear of copying the Jewish Theocracy, meddle with no morality at all? [3.] Must every thing that was once typical, be now, under the gospel, excluded from regulating authority? Must all the excellent patterns of Abel, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Joseph, Job. Moses, Aaron, Samuel, David, and other Hebrew saints be rejected as typical and useless?—Must all the laws directing to elect men, <HI>fearing God, and hating covetousness,</HI> to be magistrates, or directing them to judge justly, im∣partially and prudently, and to punish murderers, a∣dulterers, thieves, robbers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> be discarded as typi∣cal? Must the weekly Sabbath, public fasts and thanks∣givings be laid aside as typical,—a mere sign between God and the Israelites? Must the ten commandments, and all the explications of them in the Old Testament be discarded, as published in a typical manner, and to a typical people, and used as the principal part of their rule of government in the Jewish Theocracy? [4] As the Jewish church was a REAL church, and not MERELY TYPICAL, so their State was a REAL commonwealth or kingdom, and not MERELY TY∣PICAL. Whatever therefore pertained to it, <HI>as a real commonwealth,</HI> is imitable in any other. [5.] The Jewish Church and State were as REALLY DIS∣TINCT, as the Church and State are now; though I do not say precisely in the same manner. (1.) They differed in respect of REGULATING LAWS. The ceremonial law directed the Jewish church. The ju∣dicial directed the affairs of their state. (2.) They differed in their respective ACTS. The Jews worship∣ped God, offered sacrifices, and received sacraments, not as members of that state, but as members of that church. They punished evil doers by fines, im∣prisonment, banishment, burning, stoning, and hang∣ing; and fought with enemies, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> not as a church,
<PB N="59" REF="59"/>
but as a state. (3.) They differed in respect of CON∣TROVERSIES. To the church pertained the <HI>matters of the Lord,</HI> and a judging of leprosies, and between statutes and judgments. To the state belonged the <HI>matters of the king,</HI> and to judge between blood and blood, 2 Chron. xix. 10, 11. Deut. xvii. 8. (4) They differed in respect of OFFICERS. The priests were the only stated officers in the church, and pro∣phets a kind of occasional ones. Elders, Judges and Kings were governors in the State. The priests might not take the civil sword out of the hand of the ma∣gistrates; nor the magistrates offer sacrifices, burn in∣cense, or otherwise execute the priest's office. (5.) They differed in respect of CONTINUANCE. When the Jewish civil power was taken away by the Ro∣mans, the constitution of their church remained, in the days of our Saviour's debasement. And even now the Jews pretend to be a church, but not to be a state. (6.) They differed in respect of VARIATION. The constitution of their church remained much the same under Moses, Joshua, the Judges, the Kings, and after the captivity. But the form of the state underwent great alterations. (7.) They differed in respect of MEMBERS. Proselytes of the covenant were complete members of the Jewish church; but had not the same dignities or marriages allowed them in the State, as the natural Israelites. Nor had the proselytes of the gate any church privileges, though they had some civil ones. (8.) They were governed by different COURTS. The church had her courts of the Synagogue, and her ecclesiastical Sanhedrin.—The state had her courts of the gate, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and her civil Sanhedrin;—though often some Levites were judges in both, as our ruling elders in the church, may, at the same time, be civil judges, Exod. xxiv. 1. Deut. xvii 8,—12. 1 Chron. xxxiii. 4, &amp; xxvi. 30, 32. 2 Chron. xix 8, 10, 11. Jer. xxvi. 8,—11, 16. xviii. 18. with Deut xvii. 10, 11, 12. Ezek vii. 26 2 Kings vi. 32. Zech. vii. 1,—3.

Gen. xxv. 17. In the state, they were cast off by death or ontlawry. (10) Profane and scandalous persons were excluded from the Jewish temple-service and passover, while they retained their civil rights in the state, Ezek xliv. 7, 9 Deut. xxiii. 18. Jer. vii. 9,—11.

(1.) The Jewish magistracy was an <HI>ordinance of God,</HI> Exod. xviii. Num. xi. Deut. i. xvii. &amp; xvi. 18, 19. Magistracy is still an ordinance of God, to be submitted to for the Lord's sake, Rom. xiii. 1,—6 1 Pet. ii. 14. (2.) Notwithstanding God's appointment of particular persons to be their kings, the Hebrew nation had the power of electing and ad∣mitting them to their office, 1 Sam. x, xi, xvi. 2 Sam. ii. 4. &amp; v. 3. 1 Chron. xii.

By Christ kings still reign, and princes decree justice, even all the judges of the earth, Prov. viii. 15, 16. with Eph. i. 22. (6.) The manifested will of God was the proper statute book of the Jewish civil law, Deut. xvii. The will of God manifested in the laws of nature and revelation, are the supreme standard of all civil laws in the world, in which every human constitution ought to be founded, and by which the whole binding force of it is circumscribed, Acts iv. 19. &amp; v. 29. Psal, ii. 10,—12. and hence hu∣man laws become an <HI>ordinance of God,</HI> Rom. xiii. 2. (7.) The judicial laws of the Hebrew nation, regulat∣ed that which pertained to their kings, judges, war∣riors, fields, houses, injuries, crimes, punishments, mortgages, marriages, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Exod. xxi,—xxiii. Deut. xviii, xx, Lev. xviii, xx. Num. xxxvi,—xxxviii, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Our civil laws regulate the same things. (8.) Among the Jews, notorious disobedience to the declared will of God was held rebellion against him, the King of the nation, and to be condignly punished, as it tended to the good of the state, Heb. ii. 2. &amp; x. 28. Noto∣rious disobedience to the manifested will of God ought to be still held as rebellion against Him, as king of nations, and to be condignly punished, as tends to the welfare of the state,—magistrates being still set up by God to be <HI>terrors, revengers,</HI> and <HI>punishers of evil doers,</HI> and bound <HI>not to bear the sword in vain,</HI> Rom. xiii. 1,—5. 1 Pet. ii. 13, 14. Nor hath it been yet proven, That our magistrates, who have the scrip∣tures, ought to pay less real regard to them in the stat∣ing of crimes, than the Jewish rulers did. (9.) The Jewish magistrates were appointed to promote the wel∣fare of the church, in order to promote the welfare of the state, in subordination to the honour of God, the King of the nation. Magistrates are still bound to do the same, as they have opportunity, Isa. xlix. 23. &amp; lx. 3, 10, 16 Rev. xvii. 16. &amp; xxi. 24, 26. Rom. xiii. 1,—6. 1 Pet. ii. 13, 14. 1 Tim. ii. 1,—4. (10.) The Jewish church and state, as hath been just
<PB N="62" REF="62"/>
now proven, were really distinct from, and indepen∣dent of each other, having different laws, officers, courts, privileges, penalties, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The christian church and the civil state of Christians are no less distinct and indepen∣dant of each other. (11.) Nevertheless, the purity of the Jewish church, contributed much to the welfare of their state, and the right management of their state to the prosperity of their church; and bad manage∣ment in the one always tended to the hurt of the other, Deut. xxviii,—xxxii Lev. xxvi. Judges i,—xiii. 1 Sam. ii.—to 2 Chron. xxxvi Isa. i—to Mal. iv. Isa i. 19, 20. &amp; iii. 10, 11. And still righ∣teousness exalteth a nation, and sin is the reproach and ruin of any people, Prov. xiv. 34. (12.) God never commanded the Jewish magistrates to <HI>force</HI> their true religion upon their Heathen neighbours, Phili∣stines, Moabites, Ammonites, or Syrians, whom they conquered, or to put them to death for their idolatry. Nor hath He ever commanded magistrates, who have embraced the true Christian religion to FORCE men by fire or sword, or any like punishments, to embrace and profess it,—or to inslict t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e same punishments u∣pon blasphemers or idolaters in unenlightened coun∣tries, which they may do upon such as obstinately re∣bel against and apostatize from the truth, amidst plen∣tiful means of conviction and establishment in it. (13) Never did God, that I know of, require the Jewish magistrates to punish any of their subjects for <HI>lesser faults,</HI> however open or manifest, or to punish them for the <HI>simple neglect</HI> of duties <HI>strictly religious,</HI>—or to annex sentences of outlawry and of death to ecclesias∣tical <HI>cutting off</HI> by excommunication from the church. Nor can I find, that he hath enjoined any such thing upon the Christian magistrate. (14) Among the Jews, some things partaking of both a civil and religi∣ous nature, did, in these different respects, fall under the government of both Church and State. Even cir∣cumcision itself was a national badge as well as a reli∣gious seal of God's covenant.—Among Christians, public fasts and thanksgivings, calling of Synods, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> do, in different respects, fall under the power of both church and state.—Pretend therefore no more, that there is a <HI>total difference</HI> between the case of our ma∣gistrates,

If to prevent confounding of the king∣dom of Christ with the kingdoms of this world, magistrates who are heads of large political fami∣lies, must be excluded from all that care about religion, which is allotted them in our Confession of Faith, Heads of families, must, for the same reason, be excluded from establishing the gospel-worship of God in their houses, and from instruc∣ting their children or servants in the truths of di¦vine revelation, at least from requiring them to at∣tend such instructions and worship. You pretend, there is a difference; But, Sir, I insist on your stat∣ing it precisely, and proving from scripture and rea∣son, that headship over families is a more spiritual re∣lation than headship over multitudes of families; or, that magistrates cannot without sin, do what is simi∣lar to every thing which parents and masters, as such, are commanded to do. (5.) If, to prevent confoun∣ding of the church with the state, magistrates must ex∣ercise no care about religion,—must punish no public∣ly obstinate heretic, blasphemer, idolater, profan∣er of the Sabbath, or reviler of the oracles and ordi∣nances of Christ, <HI>as a criminal against the welfare of the state,</HI>—Church-courts must censure, <HI>as scandals</HI> a∣gainst the welfare of the church, no theft, murder, robbery, treason, unlawful war, perversion of civil judgment, or the like; as these pertain to the king∣doms of this world. (6) Though the powers of ci∣vil and ecclesiastical government be COORDINATE, each standing on its proper basis, and the right exer∣cise of church power contributing mightily to the welfare of the state,—and of civil power to the advance∣ment of the church,—yet they are not COLLATERAL, inseparable from, or dependent upon each other, but are altogether distinct from, and different, in many respects<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>See this point excellently handled in the Hundred and E∣leven Propositions of the Assembly, 1645. republished by Al∣ston, Edinburgh.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>

1. Civil and ecclesiastical power differ in their FOUN∣DATION. Magistracy is founded on God's universal dominion over all nations; and hence the law of na∣ture is the <HI>immediate supreme rule</HI> of its administrati∣ons, and the scriptures become the rule of them only as introduced by the law of nature, requiring magis∣trates as well as others to believe and obey whatever revelation, duly attested, God is pleased to grant them.—or, by magistrates subjecting their consciences, as followers of Christ, to the scriptures as their only rule to direct them how to glorify God and enjoy him for ever. But ecclesiastical power is founded in the oeconomical or mediatorial headship of Jesus Christ over his church, as his spiritual kingdom; and hence the immediate standard for regulating the exercise of it, is that Revelation, which God hath given to, and by him, in his word;—and the laws of nature have a regulating force in the church by virtue of the gene∣ral precepts of scripture, as 1 Cor. xiv. 26, 40. vi. 12. xvi. 14. Phil. iv. 8. Mat. vii. 12.</P>
<P N="2">2. Civil and ecclesiastical power differ in their IM∣MEDIATE OBJECT. Magistratical power immediate∣ly relates only to <HI>things external,</HI> pertaining to the outward man. Even, when exercised about sacred things, it hath that which is <HI>external</HI> for its <HI>immediate object.</HI> It removes external hindrances of spiritual exercises, and provides external opportunities and ac∣commodations for the performance of them. If ma∣gistrates call a Synod, they do not properly call it as a <HI>court of Christ,</HI> or as <HI>ministers of Christ,</HI> but as a meet∣ing of subjects, whose joint deliberations are calculat∣ed to promote the honour of God the King of nati∣ons, and the happiness of their country, by the right government of the church. If a magistrate command persons to compear before a church-court to be judg∣ed, or to bear witness, be commands them not as spiritual members of Christ's mystical body, but as his own and Jehovah's subjects, to take their trial or at∣test the truth before proper arbitrators of their cause, that God may be honoured, and through keeping of order in the church, the welfare of the city or nation may be advanced and consirmed. If he punish inso∣lent contemners of the authority and censures of the
<PB N="66" REF="66"/>
church, he punisheth them not as <HI>scandalous persons,</HI> but as <HI>criminals,</HI> insulters of that true religion which the civil law hath established, and contemners of these judicatories which it hath authorized, and to which themselves have solemnly engaged all due subjection,—and thus, as treacherous disturbers of the good or∣der and peace of his kingdom, and tramplers on the laws of the Most High Sovereign of the nation.—But church-power hath that which is <HI>spiritual</HI> for its only proper object. It properly deals with mens <HI>consciences and heart,</HI> and with their outward man, only in or∣der to affect those, in the way of conviction, reforma∣tion, comfort, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> It considers the persons with whom it deals, not as <HI>mere men,</HI> or as <HI>members of a ci∣vil</HI> society, but as members of the <HI>spiritual and mysti∣cal body of Christ,</HI> in the visible form of it.</P>
<P N="3">3. Civil and ecclesiastical power differ in their TORM. Though magistrates be the <HI>ministers of God</HI> for good to men, their power over their subjects is of a LORDLY nature. They are <HI>lordly</HI> fathers, who, by making and enforcing civil laws, can <HI>compel</HI> the disobedient.—In this view, if they establish any thing pertaining to the church, they establish it as a mean of honouring God their Superior, in the advancement of the welfare of the common wealth. If they punish faults, they con∣sider them as <HI>crimes,</HI> injurious to the happiness of the state, dishonouring God its supreme Governor, and provoking his wrath against it, and they punish those crimes only on the outward man, by fining, imprison∣ment, death, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>—But church power is altogether MINISTERIAL, distributing to men, reproofs, admo∣nitions, and other ordinances, according to the in∣spired prescriptions of Christ, Mat. xvi. 19. &amp; xviii. 18. 1 Cor. iv. 1, 2. Christ being her alone Lord, Church-rulers have no power to make any <HI>laws pro∣perly so called,</HI> Isa. xxxiii. 22 James iv. 12. In deal∣ing with offenders, they consider faults, even oppres∣sion, tyranny, sinful wars and leagues, perversion of judgment, bribery or the like in magistrates, who are members, not <HI>as crimes,</HI> but merely <HI>as scandals,</HI> desil∣ing and ruining mens souls, plaguing the church, and dishonouring and provoking Christ and his Father in
<PB N="67" REF="67"/>
him, against it. They have no <HI>compulsory power,</HI>—can punish no man either in his person or his external property, can use no weapons but such as are <HI>spiritual,</HI> mighty through God; administring church censures, not as punishments, but as spiritual privileges, and divinely instituted means of bringing offenders to a thorough repentance of their sins, to the eternal sal∣vation of their souls.—And this whole power must be used, only in the name of Jesus Christ, as Head of his church, 2 Cor. i. 24. x 4, 5, 8. xiii. 8, 10. ii. 6,—10 1 Cor, v. 4.</P>
<P N="4">4. Civil and ecclesiastical power differ in their PRO∣PER END. The <HI>formal end of magistratical power</HI> is to advance the glory of God, the King of nations, in promoting the welfare of the commonwealth;—and the establishment of the true religion, and care to pro∣mote the prosperity and propagation of the church, are used as eminent means of gaining that end. Or, the good of the church may also be considered as an <HI>accessory end</HI> of civil administration, as the better civil justice be executed, open <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> breakings restrained, and virtue encouraged by the magistrate, the fewer will probably be the scandals, and the greater the pu∣rity and prosperity of the church. Nay, though the advancement of the church's welfare be not the for∣mal end of magistracy, yet as Christ is made Head over all things to his church, every magistrate, who professeth the Christian religion, ought to pursue the formal end of his office, as subordinated to his <HI>Christian end</HI> of promoting the glory of God in the wel∣fare of the church and eternal salvation of men—But the formal <HI>end</HI> of all church power is the glorify∣ing of God in Christ, by promoting the spiritual con∣viction, conversion and edification of mens souls; and the welfare of nations is but an <HI>accessory</HI> or <HI>subor∣dinate</HI> end, at which church-rulers, as subjects in the state, ought always to aim;—as the better they pro∣secute and obtain the end of their office, the fewer will be the crimes, the better both subjects and magis∣trates, and the more numerous and valuable the bles∣sings of God on the nation.</P>
<P N="5">5. Civil and ecclesiastical power differ in their PRO∣PER EFFECTS. The <HI>proper effects</HI> of magistratical
<PB N="68" REF="68"/>
power, rightly exercised, is the good of the common∣wealth, in their commodious enjoyment of civil privi∣leges, in a manner mightily calculated to promote the honour of God, as the Most High over all the earth;—and the purity, peace and prosperity of the church, arising from the right administration of justice, dis∣couragement of evil doers, and praise of them that do well, is but an <HI>accessory effect.</HI> But the <HI>proper effect</HI> of church power rightly exercised, is the conversion of men to Jesus Christ, fellowship with him, and growth in grace and good works, to the praise of his glory; and the advantage accruing to cities or nations, by the virtuous laws and fervent prayers of church-mem∣bers, is but an <HI>accessory effect</HI> of it.</P>
<P N="6">6. Civil and ecclesiastical power differ in their SUB∣JECTS of residence. No ecclesiastical power can re∣side in a heathen, a woman, or a child; and no pow∣er of jurisdiction in a single person;—as civil power often may, or doth. Nor can one ecclesiastic officer delegate his power to another.</P>
<P N="7">7. They differ in their FORMAL CONSIDERATION OF THE PERSONS UPON WHOM THEY ARE EXER∣CISED. A magistrate's power extends over all per∣sons resident in his territory, be their moral character what it will, Jews, Heathens, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Rom. xiii 1. But church-power extends only to the professed members of Christ's mystical body, the Church, 1 Corinth. v. 12, 13.</P>
<P N="8">8. Civil and ecclesiastical power differ in respect of their DIVIDED EXERCISE. The one may, and ought to be exercised, whether the other be so or not.—The <HI>end of church-censure</HI> being to gain sinners to repentance and salvation, scandalous persons appear∣ing penitent, ought to be seasonably absolved from it, and restored to communion with the church in sealing ordinances. But the <HI>end of civil punishment</HI> being the satisfaction of the law, and the deterring of others from the like faults, criminals, however penitent and fully restored to church-fellowship, may, as the na∣ture of their crime demands, be punished, even unto death. And suppose a church-member should have satisfied the demands of the civil law for a crime, he ought to be prosecuted and censured for it as a scan∣dal,
<PB N="69" REF="69"/>
by the ecclesiastical courts, till he appear duly penitent. Not only ought church-rulers to censure scandalous persons, when magistrates take no no∣tice of their faults, but even to censure magistrates, who are church-members, for what wickedness they commit under colour of countenance from the civil law. And where magistrates punish, and church-rulers censure the same persons for the same faults, the processes ought to be kept entirely distinct from, and independent of each other;—though, to prevent unnecessary swearing, the proof taken in one court may sometimes be produced and judged of, also in the other.</P>
<P>OBJECT. XXII. <Q REND="inline">"Magistrates not being proper judges of the doctrines of Revelation, cannot be ca∣pable to judge concerning religious matters, and par∣ticularly to determine who are heretics, blasphemers, or idolaters"</Q> ANSW. (1.) That they have a right to judge in these matters hath been already established. (2) God, who knows all things, admits private Chris∣tians to be capable of judging what is heresy, blas∣phemy and idolatry, and who are heretics, blasphe∣mers and idolaters, and hence commands them to keep themselves from these sins, and to avoid such sedu∣cers, and debar them from their houses, Rom. xvi. 17. 2 Tim. iii. 5. 1 Cor. v. 11. 1 John iv. 1,—3. &amp; v. 21. 2 John 9,—11. Now what hinders Christi∣an magistrates to have as much good sense and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s much capacity of judging in these matters, as common Christians (2.) The gross errors, blasphemies and idolatries which magistrates ought to restrain, and <HI>sui∣tably</HI> and <HI>seasonably</HI> punish, are so plainly condemned by the word of God, which magistrates ought carefully to search, under the direction of the Holy Spirit, that any unbiassed person of common capacity may easily discern them. (3.) The advice of faithful ministers, and the common consent of Christian churches, may assist magistrates in discerning from the word of God, what is gross or damnable heresy, blasphemy, idolatry.</P>
<P>OBJECT. XXIII. <Q REND="inline">"If magistrates, as such, have a power of judging in religious matters, then Heathen magistrates must also be allowed to make laws concer∣ning religion and the church, while in the mean time

they cannot be censured by the church, if they do a∣miss."</Q> ANSW. (1.) What could you gain, if I should plead, that it is magistrates Christianity requiring them to execute their office in subordination to it, that is the immediate origin of their power about the mat∣ters of religion, even as it is parents Christianity that warrants them to receive baptism for their in∣fants? But (2.) Heathen magistrates, with God's di∣rection and approbation, have made laws respecting religion, Ezra vii. 13,—28. vi. 1,—14. i. 1,—3. Dan. iii. 29. vi. 26. Jonah iii. Dare you condemn the Al∣mighty? (3) Heathen magistrates have the same power as Christian magistrates, but are less capable to use it aright; even as heathen parents and masters have the same power over their children and servants as Christians, but are less qualified to discern and per∣form their duty. (4.) Neither heathen nor Christian magistrates have any power at all against the truth, but for the truth,—any power for the destruction of the church, but for her edification, 2 Cor. xiii. 8, 10. (5) Heathen magistrates therefore, ought carefully to improve what assistance they have by the light of nature and works of creation and providence, or by any Revelation from God, to which they have access,—always taking heed to make no laws, but such as they certainly know to be agreeable to the law of God.—It is not to be expected, that civil laws can forbid every fault and require every thing good in externals; but they ought never to encourage sin, or discourage duty.</P>
<P>OBJECT. XXIV. <Q REND="inline">"To allow magistrates a power of judging about the matters of religion will make them church-rulers."</Q> ANSW. (1) No more than it made Nebuchadnezzar, Darius, Cyrus, Darius, and Artaxerxes, and the king of Nineveh church-rulers. (2.) No more than church-rulers taking cognizance of murder, adultery, incest, theft, robbery, or even of the conduct of Christian magistrates relative to ad∣ministration of justice, wars, alliances, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> will make them magistrates. (3.) How often must you be told, that church-rulers judge, how such profession or prac∣tice ought to stand connected with ecclesiastical encon∣couragements,
<PB N="71" REF="71"/>
discouragements or censure; but ma∣gistrates judge, how such profession or practice ought to be connected with civil encouragements or discou∣ragements. Church-rulers warn against, and censure mens public faults, <HI>only as scandals,</HI> disgraceful and hurtful to the church Magistrates judge of, and pu∣nish them <HI>only as crimes,</HI> hurtful to the prosperity of the State. In church courts, matters are considered as the <HI>matters of the Lord.</HI> In civil courts, they are considered as the <HI>matters os the king,</HI> 2 Chron. xix. 8,—11. Ministers as the deputies of Christ, require magistrates to execute their office for the honour of Christ, and welfare of his church, and censure them, if church-members, if they do not. Magistrates as vicegerents of God, the King of nations, require mi∣nisters faithfully to execute their office, particularly as stated by the laws of the land, in order to promote virtue and happiness among the subjects, and draw the blessing of God upon them; and they punish them <HI>as undutiful subjects,</HI> if they notoriously transgress, 1 Kings ii. 26. Magistrates have NO ECCLESIASTICAL POWER at all. They have no power to restrain or hinder the free and full exercise of church power. But, by giving full opportunity, encouragement and excitement to church officers, they have power to pro∣vide that church power be freely and faithfully exer∣cised in their dominions. They have no power to transact any thing ecclesiastical, as in admission of members into the church, or to the seals of God's co∣venant;—no power to choose or ordain church offi∣cers;—no power to preach the gospel, dispense the sa∣crament, inflict censures, or absolve from them.—They have no power to prescribe or enact any eccle∣siastical laws; but they have power to adopt such law∣ful and expedient constitutions, as have been made by the church-courts, into their civil code, by a legal ra∣tification,—and power to enact such <HI>political laws</HI> as are necessary for the more advantageous execution of these ecclesiastical constitutions. They have no power to frame a religion for their subjects, or ratify a false religion already received or framed, or to establish a∣ny thing in religion, which is not founded in the word of God; but they have a power to adopt the law of
<PB REF="72"/>
God, and the religion prescribed by it, as a part of their civil law, in order to promote the glory of God in the welfare of the nation.—The more public church courts be, and the more extensive his influence upon his subjects, and the welfare of the nation,—the more right hath the civil magistrate to exercise his <HI>po∣litical power</HI> about them. The church having an in∣trinsic right and power from Christ to call Synods for government, whenever her circumstances require it, the magistrate hath no power to deprive her of this right. But while the church calls them as courts of Christ, constituted of church rulers appointed by him to act in his name, the magistrate may call them as courts established by the civil law, and necessary to to promote the peace, order and piety, and so the prosperity of his subjects,—as courts, which consist of his principal subjects, and to which place and protecti∣on must be given in his dominions. The magistrate hath no power of deputing to Synods such members as he pleaseth, Acts xv. 2 Chron. viii. 18. or, to hin∣der or recal those whom the church hath deputed, unless the safety of the state plainly require it. But he may compel members, and parties who have causes before the court, to attend, if the case of the church require it, as a mean of repressing a malicious and turbulent faction, who have, or may hurt the State. It is not necessary, that either the magistrate, or his Commissioner, attend ecclesiastical Synods;—though to secure their protection, curb unruly troublers of the court, and to witness the propriety of their pro∣cedure, he may attend.—If he attend, He hath a power to judge for himself, how matters are ecclesias∣tically transacted,—a power <HI>politically</HI> to provide, That the members meddle with no political affairs, which do not belong to them as a court of Christ:—and to take care, that members, and others present, observe that due decency, in reasoning, voting, submitting, or hearing, which the nature of the court requires. If any cause be partly civil and partly ecclesiastical, he is to judge the civil part himself, and leave the ecclesi∣astical to the church court.—Even in ecclesiastical causes, he may give his advice, nay, he may propose and require Synods to examine and decide concerning
<PB N="73" REF="73"/>
points of doctrine or practice, if necessary for the sa∣tisfaction of his own conscience, or the instruction and edification of his subjects, in order to promote the welfare of the state, in subordination to the glory of God. But he hath no power to hinder others to pro∣pose their difficulties or grievances before the Synod for satisfaction or redress, unless the cause be partly of a political nature, a Synodical decision of which, at that time, endangers the state.—He hath no pow∣er to preside in the Synod, or give his decisive vote in any of their transactions. But, as a man and Christi∣an, he hath right to a <HI>judgment of discretion,</HI> Whether their decisions be according to the law of God or not,—and as a magistrate, he hath a power of <HI>political judgment,</HI> by which he doth not properly judge, Whe∣ther these decisions be true or false, good or bad in themselves, but Whether, and How far, they ought to be ratified, and as it were adopted into the laws of the State, and connected with civil rewards, forbear∣ance, or punishments. Thus, the power of the ma∣gistrate, <HI>in nothing</HI> interferes with the power of the Synod. Nothing is done by the one, as a magistrate, that the other can do, as a court of Christ. And as the decisions of Synods are <HI>supreme in the ecclesiastic order,</HI> from which there is no appeal but to Jesus Christ;—By remonstrating as a church-member, and commanding them as their King, the magistrate may cause the Synod re-consider its own deeds, but he can∣not reverse them himself;—so the magistrate's deed concerning the civil ratification of church-deeds is <HI>su∣preme in its kind,</HI> from which there is no appeal but to God himself. The Synod may require him as a Church-member; and, as subjects, they may remon∣strate, and supplicate his re-consideration of his own deed, but they cannot reverse it themselves.</P>
<P>OBJECT. XXV. <Q REND="inline">"To allow magistrates to judge in matters of religion for others, and to restrain and punish corruptions in it, is to render them Lords of mens faith and conscience,—a power which even the inspired apostles disclaimed. For if magistrates impose any religion at all upon their subjects, it must be what their own conscience dictates; and then what shall become of the private rights of conscience, among
<PB N="74" REF="74"/>
their subjects?"</Q> ANSW. (1.) Did then God, who of old commanded magistrates to judge about matters of religion, and to restrain and punish blasphemers, idolaters, seducers, profaners of the Sabbath, Deut. xiii. 9, 10. &amp; xvii. 5,—7. Lev. xxiv. 11,—14. Song ii. 15. Num. xv. 32,—36. command them to lord it over mens conscience? If it was not so then, it can∣not be so now, as conscience, tyranny and murder, are the same in every age. (2) The objection strikes with equal force, against all ecclesiastical establish∣ment of the true religion, and against all creeds and Confessions of Faith, and against all ecclesiastical judging and censuring of men for heresy, blasphemy, or idolatry, contrary to Rev. ii. 20. Titus iii 10. Gal. v. 10, 11. as against magistrates judging about esta∣blishing religion or punishing the public insulters of it. (3.) Magistrates act in this matter as <HI>his ministers</HI> and vicegerents, by virtue of his commandment, who is the alone Lord of conscience, and restrain or punish nothing, but what men, under any proper influence of faith and conscience, would abstain from, as for∣bidden by the Lord of conscience, who is to be their future judge, and hath appointed magistrates, as his substitutes to avenge the open injuries done to him in this world, Rom. xiii. 4. And, if men persist in sins plainly forbidden in his law, he holds them as sin∣ners against, and condemned by their conscience, Tit. iii. 10, 11. (4) The absurdity of mens consciences being sustained as a standard, as well as the proper me∣thod of magistrates making laws relative to religion, have been already manifested. Magistrates conscien∣ces have no more just claim to God bead than those of their meanest subjects. Not, therefore, magistrates pretences to conscience, but plain and evident marks of the authority of God manifested in, and from the scriptures, must determine their subjects to receive a religion in obedience to their authority, as subordinat∣ed to the authority of God, the Most High, superior of both.</P>
<P>OBJECT. XXVI. <Q REND="inline">"In Rom. xiii. where the power of magistrates is more fully described than any where else in the New Testament, only the commands of the

second table of the moral law are subjoined, to mark that it only extends to the concerns of men one with another."</Q> ANSW. (1.) Who authorized the objector to put asunder the two Testaments and the two tables which God hath joined? Or, to separate the first part of that chapter from the last, which certainly relates to religion, any more than from verse 9th. (2.) The magistrate's character, <HI>minister of God for good, terror</HI> to, and <HI>revenger of evil doers,</HI> and his duty to love his neighbours as himself there hinted, cannot admit of his having no care about religion and the first table of the moral law.

<P>OBJECT. XXVII. <Q REND="inline">"If we allow magistrates any power at all about religious matters, we must plunge ourselves into inextricable difficulties, as the precise limits of civil and ecclesiastical power can never be fix∣ed,—and every small mistake in religious opinions, or neglect of religious duties, must bring men to the gib∣bet, as theft draws down the wrath of God on nati∣ons, as well as blasphemy and idolatry do"</Q> ANSW. There is no more difficulty in limiting the power of magistrates about either religion or virtue, than in fixing precise limits to the power of church-rulers re∣lative to those matters. Do you fix precise limits to church-power according to the word of God, and I shall next moment fix as precise limits for the power of the magistrate. If you limit the exercise of church power to duties required, and sins forbidden in the first table of the moral law,—you naturally leave the care of the duties required in the second table to the magistrate. But then, whether a church of Christ, having no care or power about morality toward men,—or a deputed kingdom of God without any care or power about any thing relating to the honour of God, be most absurd and devilish, I know not. If you a∣ver, That the power of church-rulers extends to the external obedience or disobedience of church-members to both tables of God's law, not as <HI>civil,</HI> but as <HI>spiri∣tual</HI> conduct, tending to the spiritual advantage or hurt of the church, and therefore connected with the
<PB N="76" REF="76"/>
spiritual encouragements or frowns of Christ's visible church; and that they meddle not with sins against the second table <HI>as crimes</HI> against mens person or pro∣perty, but <HI>as scandals</HI> against the spiritual edification of the church, and the glory of Jesus Christ therein concerned;—I immediately reply, That precisely, in like manner, the power of magistrates extends to the external obedience or disobedience of <HI>civil subjects as such,</HI> to both tables of God's law, <HI>not as it is of a spiritual nature,</HI> but <HI>as it affects the civil welfare or hurt of the nation,</HI> or honour of God as the King of it, and so ought to stand connected with civil encou∣ragements or discouragements. If you pretend, that it will be still hard to shew, how far magistrates may, in that view, proceed in matters of the first table, par∣ticularly with respect to offending clergymen I an∣swer, that it is not one whit harder, than to shew how far church courts may proceed in matters of the se∣cond table, particularly with respect to offensive ma∣gistratical administrations. (2.) Your pretence, that if magistrates punish any faults in religion, they must punish all known faults in the same form and degree, is but a deceitful insult on the Most High, who, in his word, appointed the capital punishment of idolaters and blasphemers, and yet never warranted the punish∣ment of many faults relative to religion, in like man∣ner; nay, for ought I see, hath not required magistrates at all to punish any thing but the most atrocious faults in it. If you insult Christ, who hath not command∣ed any faults, but atrocious ones obstinately continu∣ed in, to be censured with excommunication, and hath never commanded many lesser neglects and infirmities of church-members to be censured at all,—It is an in∣sult on common sense. Would you, or any man in his wits, either censure or punish men <HI>as severely</HI> for a simple neglect of a religious duty, as for an open and blasphemous insulting of religion? Would you censure or punish the stealing of a single straw as se∣verely as the stealing of a man or woman?

If every species of duty must be neglected, and the contrary sin allowed, where it is difficult to fix the precise boundaries of sin or duty,—or where it is difficult to fix the precise degrees of encourage∣ment to be given to such obedience, or of censure or punishment due to such sin, men must be left to live like absolute atheists, in both church and state, every man doing that which is right in his own eyes. (2) Unless you prove that every insult of, and outrage a∣gainst God and his religion ought to pass unpunished, and even be licensed and authorized, yourself must be equally embarrassed in fixing what is punishable and what is not, and what must be the form and degree of punishment annexed to each punishable fault.

Church-rulers have no other infallible rule to direct them in their decisi∣ons, than magistrates have.

(4.) Though the weapons of ministers warfare, in propagating the gospel be not carnal, What is that to the case of magistrates? And as the spiritual weapons of church-officers reach as much to sins against the se∣cond table of the moral law as to those against the sirst, they no more exclude the use of the magistrates carnal weapons against the atrocious sins against the first ta∣ble, than with respect to those against the second, 2 Cor. x. 6. 1 Cor. v. 2,—5, (4.)

It can restrain burning of Bibles or abusing and murder∣ing of preachers and hearers of the gospel. It can spread the scriptures, and protect preachers of the truths contained in them; and by command, example, and otherwise, encourage the subjects to search the scriptures, and to hear, learn, profess, and practise the plain doctrines of the gospel.

Being treacherously and cruelly opposed in their re∣formation of religion, by their two Popish Queens, the Protestant Lords and others in Scotland, entered into five several bonds, A. D. 1557, 1559, 1560, 1563, in which they solemnly engaged to assist and protect each other, in promoting the free exercise of the Protestant religion. It was only the smaller part of the Protestants in our land, which entered into these bonds,—nor doth it appear, they were intended as ge∣neral obligations.—But, when the Papists abroad were labouring, with all their might, to extirpate the Pro∣testant religion; and the Pope was found to have granted dispensations for qualifying his votaries, to undermine it in our land,—the <HI>National Covenant</HI> was formed and sworn in 1581—in order to frustrate their attempts, and secure the reformation attained. In it the abominations of Popery were expresly and parti∣cularly abjured; and it was understood as adhered to and renewed in every religious bond that sollowed. After God had marvellously frustrated the attempts of the Spaniards and other Papists against Britain, our fathers, in thankfulness to Him,—and to secure themselves against the Popish confederates abroad, and their friends at home,—with much unanimity and joy renewed their <HI>National Covenant,</HI> A. D 1590, along with the subscription of a General Bond for preserva∣tion of the Protestant religion, and the King's Majes∣ty. In 1596, apprehensions of danger from the Po∣pish Lords, and the treacherous regard shewed them by K. James, and especially a very extraordinary effu∣sion of the Holy Ghost on the General Assembly, is∣sued in much solemn mourning for sin, and renovati∣on of their covenant with God. After forty years of fearful perfidious apostacy, and much sinful veering towards the abjured abominations of Popery, they, awakened by K. Charles and Archbishop Laud's im∣position of an almost Popish <HI>Liturgy</HI> and <HI>Book of Ca∣nons,</HI>—Searched out, and lamented, their perfidy to God, as the cause of their manifold miseries; and so∣lemnly renewed their covenant with Him, as a mean of obtaining his gracious assistance, and securing their Protestant religion and liberties. Affrighted by the Papists massacring of about two hundred thousand

Protestants in Ireland, instigated by their distresses in England, and encouraged by the remarkable coun∣tenance of God's Spirit and Providence to the Scotch covenanters. Most of the English and Irish Protestants in 1643 and 1644. along with them, entered into a Solemn League and Covenant with God, and with one another, in which they expresly abjured Popery, and Prelacy as a branch of it.—K. Charles had scarce granted a peace, a kind of establishment of their re∣ligion to the murderous Papists in Ireland; and Duke Hamilton's attempts to restore him to his throne with∣out giving any security for religion or liberty miscar∣ried in England, when the Scots, and not a few of the Irish renewed their Covenant, with a solemn acknow∣ledgment of sins and engagement to duties.—To manifest the fearful perfidy of all <HI>authoritative tolera∣tion</HI> of gross heresy, blasphemy, idolatry, Popery, and every other form of encouragement to, or recep∣tion of them, the <HI>solemn,</HI> the <HI>religious</HI> nature of these covenants, and their <HI>extensive</HI> and <HI>perpetual obligati∣on</HI> must be considered.</P>
<P>God alone bath a supreme and unlimited authority and right to regulate his own, and the conduct of all his creatures, Psal. lxxxiii. 18. Dan. iv. 35. James iv. 12. But the very constitution of a rational crea∣ture, implies a power derived from him to govern it∣self, even as mens standing in the relation of parents, masters, magistrates, or church-rulers, necessarily im∣plies their power to govern others,—<HI>in subordination to him.</HI> By virtue of their divinely originated authority over others, parents, masters, and other rulers make laws, or binding rules, for directing the external be∣haviour of those who are committed to their charge. And by their authority derived from God to <HI>rule their own</HI> Spirit, and to <HI>govern</HI> and <HI>keep in subjection their whole body,</HI> Prov. xvi. 32. James iii. 2. 1 Cor. ix. 27. all men are empowered to make for themselves laws of self engagement, in promises, oaths, vows and co∣venants, which extend to their purposes and inclinati∣ons as well as to their external acts. And, as all the authority, which men have over themselves or others, is derived srom that supreme and independent autho∣rity, which is in God himself, and is communicated
<PB N="98" REF="98"/>
to them, by an act of his will, and is implied in his giving them such a nature and station, it is plain, that no human laws of authority, or self-engagement, can have any obligation or binding force, but what are re∣gulated by and subordinated to the divine laws of na∣ture or revelation, 2 Cor. xiii. 8. and that, if such laws and engagements be lawful, God, not only doth, but must necessarily ratify them, his law requiring the fulsilment of them, under pain of his highest dis∣pleasure, Rom. xiii. 1,—6. Mat. v. 33.</P>
<P>As no <HI>deputed authority</HI> derived from God, can increase that supreme, that infinite authority, which he hath in himself; so no human command or engagement can increase that infinite obligation to duty, which his law hath <HI>in itself.</HI> But, if lawful, they have in them a <HI>real obligation, distinct,</HI> though neither <HI>separated</HI> nor <HI>separable,</HI> from the obligation of God's law. To pre∣tend with Bellarmine and other Papists, that our pro∣mises or vows do not bind us <HI>in moral duties</HI> comman∣ded by the law of God, is manifestly absurd. It ne∣cessarily infers, that all human commands of superiors as well as human promises, oaths, vows, and cove∣nants, are in themselves destitute of <HI>all binding force,</HI> except in so far as they relate to such trifling things, as the law of God doth not require of men in such particular truths; and thus saps the foundation of all relative order and mutual trust and confidence among mankind. Commands of superiors must be <HI>mere de∣clarations</HI> of the will of God in his law, and promises, oaths, vows and covenants must be nothing but <HI>mere acknowledgments,</HI> that God's law requires such things from us,—in so far as relating to moral duties. It re∣presents the authority which God hath in himself, and with which he hath invested men, as his deputies, as so inconsistent and mutually destructive of each other, that men cannot be bound to the same thing by both. It represents the law of God as necessarily destructive of the being of an ordinance appointed by itself, to promote the more exact observance of itself,—in so far as that ordinance binds to a conscientious and diligent obedience to it. It is contrary to the common sense of mankind in every age, who have all along consi∣dered

Jer. xxxiv. 18.—which represents an oath as a strong and decisive <HI>confirmation,</HI> putting an end to all doubt or strife, Heb. vi. 16,—18.—and which in one of the plainest and least figurative chapters of it, repeatedly represents a vow, as constituted by our <HI>binding ourselves, binding our own souls with a bond,</HI> and represents a vow as a <HI>bond</HI> or <HI>obligation,</HI> Heb. ISSAR, <HI>a very fast and strait binding bond</HI> or <HI>obligation,</HI>—as <HI>our own bond,</HI> that stands upon or against us, Num. xxx. 2,—12.—<HI>Self-binding, self engagements,</HI> is so much the <HI>essential form</HI> of vows, and of all covenants, promises, or promis∣sory oaths, whether of God or man, that they can∣not exist at all, or even be conceived of without it, any more than a man without a soul, or an angel with∣out an understanding and will. To represent vowing as a <HI>placing of ourselves more directly under the law of God,</HI> or any command of it; or, as a <HI>placing of ourselves in some new relation to the law,</HI> is but an at∣tempt to render unintelligible that which the Holy Ghost hath, in the above-mentioned chapter, labour∣ed to make plain, if it doth not also import, that we can place ourselves <HI>more directly</HI> under the moral law than God hath or can place us, or, more directly than Christ was placed.—To pretend, that mens commands or engagements derive their whole obligation from the <HI>law of God's requiring</HI> us to <HI>obey</HI> the one,—and <HI>pay,</HI> or <HI>fulfil</HI> or <HI>perform</HI> the other, is no less absurd.—These divine commands, requiring us to obey, pay, perform or fulfil human laws and engagements, <HI>plain∣ly suppose</HI> an <HI>intrinfic</HI> obligation, in these laws and en∣gagements, and powerfully enforce it. But no law of God can require me to OBEY a human law, or ful∣fil
<PB N="100" REF="100"/>
an engagement which hath no obligation in itself, any more than the laws of Britain can oblige me to PAY a Bill, or FULFIL a Bond consisting of nothing but mere cyphers.</P>
<P>The <HI>intrinsic obligation</HI> of promises, oaths, vows, and covenants which constitutes their very essence or essential form, is totally and manifestly distinct from the obligation of the law of God in many respects. (1.) In his law, God, by the declaration of his will, as our supreme Ruler, binds us, Deut. xii. 32. In promises, vows, covenants, and promissory oaths, we, as his deputy-governors over ourselves, by a declaration of our will, <HI>bind ourselves with a bond, bind our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>uls with our own bond, our own vow,</HI> Num, xxx. Psalm lxvi. 13, 15 &amp; cxix. 106, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> (2.) The obligation of our promises, oaths and covenants is alway subject to examination by the standard of God's law, as to both its matter and manner, 1 Thess. v. 21. But it would be presumption, blasphemous presumption, to examine, Whether, what we know to be the law of God be right and obligatory, or not, James iv. 11, 12. Isa. viii. 20. Deut. v. 32. (3.) The law of God ne∣cessarily binds all men to the <HI>most absolute perfection in holiness,</HI> be they as incapable of it as they will, Matth. v. 48. 1 Pet. i. 15, 16. No man can, without mock∣ing and tempting of God, bind himself by vow or oath to any thing, but what he is able to perform. No man may vow to do any thing which is not in his own power, and for the performance of which he hath no promise of ability from God. But, no mere man since the fall is able, in this life either in himself or by any grace received from God, <HI>perfectly</HI> to keep the commandments of God, Eccl. vii. 20 James iii. 2. While God remains God, his law can demand no less than absolute perfection in holiness. While his word remains true, no mere man since the fall, in this life, can possibly attain to it; and therefore ought never to promise or vow it. The least imperfection in holi∣ness, however involuntary, breaks the law of God, and is even contrary to the duty of our relative stati∣ons of hushands, parents, masters, magistrates, mini∣sters, wives, children, servants or people, 1 John iii. 4. Rom. vii. 14, 23, 24. But it is only by that
<PB N="101" REF="101"/>
which is, in some respect, <HI>voluntary sinfulness,</HI> that we break our lawful vows, Psal. xliv. 47. Nothing can more clearly mark the distinction of the two obligati∣ons, than this particular. There is no evading the force of it, but either by adopting the Arminian <HI>new law</HI> of sincere obedience, or by adopting the Popish perfection of saints in this life. (4.) The law of God binds <HI>all men for ever,</HI> whether in heaven or hell, Psal. iii. 7, 8. No human law or self-engagement binds men, but <HI>only in this life,</HI> in which they remain imperfect, and are encompassed with temptations to seduce them from their duty. In heaven they have no need of such helps to duty, and in hell they can∣not be profited by them.</P>
<P>The obligation of lawful promises, oaths, vows and covenants, as well as of human laws, respecting moral duties, however <HI>distinct,</HI> is no more separable from the obligation of God's law, than Christ's <HI>two distinct natures</HI> are separable, the one from the other, but closely connected in manifold respects. In binding ourselves to necessary duties, and to other things so long and so far as is conducive thereto, God's law as the only rule to direct us how to glorify and enjoy him, is made the rule of our engagement. Our vow is no <HI>new rule</HI> of duty, but a <HI>new</HI> bond to make the law of God <HI>our rule.</HI> Even Adam's engagement to perfect obedience in the covenant of works was noth∣ing else. His sallibility in his estate of innocence, made it proper, that he should be bound by his own consent or engagement, as well as by the authority of God. Our imperfection in this life, and the temp∣tations which surround us, make it needful, that we, in like manner, should be bound to the same rule, both by the authority of God, and our own engage∣ments. It is in the law of God, that all our deputed authority to command others, or to bind ourselves is allotted to us. The requirement of moral duties by the law of God obligeth us to use all lawful means to promote the performance of them; and hence requires human laws and self-engagements, and the observance of them as conducive to it. Nay they are also expres∣ly required in his law, as his ordinances for helping and hedging us in to our duty. In making lawful
<PB N="102" REF="102"/>
vows, as well as in making human laws, we exert the <HI>deputed authority</HI> of God, <HI>the supreme Lawgiver,</HI> grant∣ed to us in his law, in the manner which his law prescribes, and in obedience to its prescription. In forming our vows as an instituted ordinance of God's worship, which he hath required us to receive, observe, and keep pure and entire, Psal. lxxvi. 11. &amp; cxix. 106. &amp; lvi. 12. Isa. xix. 18, 21. &amp; xlv. 23, 24. &amp; xliv. 5. Jer. l. 5. 2 Cor. viii. 5.—we act precisely according to the direction of his law, and in obedience to his au∣thority in it,—<HI>binding ourselves with a bond, binding our soul with a bond,</HI> Num. xxx. 2,—11.—<HI>binding our∣selves by that which we utter with our lips,</HI> ver. 2, 6, 12.—<HI>binding ourselves with a binding oath,—binding our∣selves—binding our soul by our own vow—our own bond,</HI> ver. 4, 7, 14. In forming our vow, we, according to the prescription of his own law, solemnly constitute God, who is the supreme Lawgiver and Lord of the conscience,—the witness of our self-engagement, and the Guarantee, graciously to reward our evangelical fulfilment of it, and justly to punish our perfidious violation of it. The more punctual and faithful ob∣servation of God's law, notwithstanding our mani∣fold infirmities and temptations, and the more effec∣tual promoting of his glory therein, is the END of our self-engagements, as well as of human laws of autho∣rity. And by a due regard to their binding force, as above stated, is this end promoted,—as hereby the ob∣ligation of God's law is the more deeply impressed on our minds, and we are shut up to obedience to it, and deterred from transgressing it—In consequence of our formation of our vow, with respect to its matter, manner, and end, as prescribed by God, He doth, and necessarily must ratify it in all its awful solemnities, requiring us by his law, to <HI>pay</HI> it as a bond of <HI>debt,</HI>—to <HI>perform</HI> and <HI>fulfill</HI> it as an engagement to duties, and an <HI>obligation</HI> which <HI>stands upon</HI> or <HI>against</HI> us, Num. xxx. 5, 7, 9, 11. with Deut. xxiii. 21,—23. Psalm lxxvi. 11. &amp; l. 14. Eccl. v. 4, 5. Mat. v. 33. In o∣bedience to this divine requirement, and considering our vow, in that precise form, in which God in his law, adopts and ratifies it, and requires it to be ful∣filled,
<PB N="103" REF="103"/>
We pay, perform, and fulfil it <HI>as a bond,</HI> wherewith we, in obedience to Him, <HI>have bound ourselves,</HI> to endeavour universal obedience to his law, as our only rule of faith and manners. Who∣ever doth not, in his attempts to obey human laws or to fulfil self-enagements, consider them as having that binding force which the law of God allows them, he pours contempt on them, as ordinances of God, and on the law of God for allowing them a <HI>binding force.</HI> Thus, through maintaining the <HI>superadded</HI> but <HI>subor∣dinate</HI> obligation of human laws, and of self-engage∣ments to moral duties, we do not make void, but es∣tablish the obligation of God's law.</P>
<P>The obligation of a vow, by which we engage our∣selves to necessary duties commanded by the law of God, must therefore be INEXPRESSIBLY SOLEMN. Not only are we required by the law of God before our vow was made; but we are bound, in that per∣formance, to fulfil our vow, as an engagement or o∣bligation founded in the supreme authority of his law warranting us to make it. We are bound to fulfil it as a <HI>mean of further impressing</HI> his authority manifested in his law, upon our own consciences,—as a bond se∣curing and promoting a faithful obedience to all his commandments We are bound to fulfil it, in obe∣dience to that divine authority, by derived power from which, we as governors of ourselves made it to pro∣mote his honour. In those or like respects, our ful∣filment of our vows is a direct obedience to his whole law.—We are moreover bound to fulfil it, as a so∣lemn ordinance of God's worship, the essential form of which lies in <HI>self-obligation,</HI> and must be received, observed, kept pure and entire, and holily and reve∣rently used, and so in obedience to Command I. II. III. We are bound to fulfil it, as an ordinance of God, in which we have <HI>pledged our own truth, sincerity and faithfulness;</HI> and so in obedience to Command IX. I. II. III. We are bound to fulfil it, as a solemn deed or grant, in which we have made over our persons, property, and service to the Lord and his church; and so in obedience to Command I. II. VIII. nay, in obedience to the whole law of love and equity, Mat. xxii. 37, 39. &amp; vii. 12. We are bound to fulfil it
<PB N="104" REF="104"/>
from regard to the declarative glory of God, as the witness of our making of it, that he may appear to have been called to attest nothing, but sincerity and truth; and so in obedience to Command I. III. IX. We are bound to fulsil it from a regard to <HI>truth, honesty,</HI> and <HI>reverence of God,</HI> as things not only com∣manded by his law, but good in themselves, agree∣able to his very nature, and therefore necessarily com∣manded by him,—and from a detestation of falsehood, injustice, and contempt of God, as things intrinsically evil, contrary to his nature, and therefore necessarily forbidden in his law; and thus in regard to his au∣thority in his whole law, as necessarily holy, just and good We are bound to fulfil it, from a regard to the holiness, justice, faithfulness, majesty, and other perfections of God, as the Guarantee of it, into whose hand we have committed the determination and exe∣cution of its awful sanction,—as the gracious rewar∣der of our fidelity, or just revenger of our perfidy,—and hence in regard to our own happiness, as con∣cerned in that sanction—In fine, We are bound to fulfil it in obedience to that command of God, which adopts and ratifies it, requiring us to <HI>pay, fulfil,</HI> or <HI>per∣form</HI> our vow, oath or covenant, Psal. l. 14. &amp; lxxvi. 11. Eccl. v. 4. Deut. xxiii. 21,—23 Mat. v. 33.</P>
<P>In VIOLATING such a vow, We do not merely transgress the law of God, as requiring the duties en∣gaged, before the vow was made. But we also rebel against, and profane that divine warrant which we had to make our vow. We profane that authority over ourselves in the exercise of which we made the vow, and consequentially that supreme authority in God, from which ours was derived; and so strike a∣gainst the foundation of the whole law. We mani∣fest a contempt of that law, which regulated the mat∣ter and manner of our vow. We profane the vow, as an ordinance of God's worship, appointed in his law. By trampling on a noted mean of promoting obedience to all the commands of God, We mark our hatred of them, and prepare ourselves to transgress them, and endeavour to remove the awe of God's au∣thority and terror of his judgments from our conscien∣ces. We blasphemously represent the Most High as
<PB N="105" REF="105"/>
a willing Witness to our treachery and fraud. We pour contempt on him, as the Guarantee of our en∣gagements, as if he inclined not, or durst not avenge our villainy. Contrary to the truth and faithfulness required in his law, and pledged in our vow, we plunge ourselves into the most criminal deceit and falsehood. Contrary to equity, we rob God and his church of that which we had solemnly devoted to their service. Contrary to devotion, we banish the serious impression of God's adorable perfections. Contrary to good neighbourhood, we render ourselves a plague and curse, and encourage others to the most enor∣mous wickedness. Contrary to the design of our creation and preservation, we reject the glory of God, and obedience to his law from being our end. Mean∣while, we trample on the ratification of our vow, by the divine law in all its awful solemnities, and mani∣fold connections with itself,—and requirement to pay it.</P>
<P>It is manifest, that our covenanting ancestors un∣derstood their vows in the manner above represented.

<P N="2">II. These public covenants of our ancestors, in which they abjured the Popish and other abominati∣ons, may be called NATIONAL, because the represen∣tatives, or the greater or better part of the nation, jointly entered into them, as covenants of duty graft∣ed upon the covenant of grace. But they ought never to be called <HI>national</HI> or <HI>civil,</HI> in order to exclude them from being <HI>church-covenants,</HI> and thus diminish the solemnity or continuance of their obligation. Both church and state jointly promoted them, and in dif∣ferent respects they related to both, being at once cove∣nants of men with God, and with one another. In so far as therein they covenanted with one another, with an <HI>immediate</HI> view to promote or preserve what belong∣ed to the state, they served instead of a civil bond. But at the same time, they covenanted with one ano∣ther as church-members, in subordination to their covenanting with God himself as their principal party.—The ratifications given to these covenants by the State were really <HI>civil ratifications,</HI> which adopted them as a part of the laws of the State.—But that no more rendered them <HI>merely civil</HI> covenants, than the civil ratifications given to, and embodying our Confessions of Faith, made them <HI>merely civil con∣fessions,</HI> and mere acts of Parliament,—or than the repeated legal establishment of our Protestant religion in doctrine, worship, discipline and government, made it a mere <HI>civil religion.</HI> These covenants were some∣times used as means of promoting civil purposes. But that will no more prove them merely civil, than the
<PB N="107" REF="107"/>
use of fasting and prayer for advancing or securing the welfare of the State, will prove them a <HI>mere civil worshipping of God.</HI>—These covenants were formed for promoting the happiness of both church and state, and were calculated to answer that end. But so is the chris∣tian religion and all the ordinances of it, if duly obser∣ved, 1 Tim. i. 8. Prov. xiv. 34. I admit, that there was sometimes too mixed an interference of civil and ec∣clesiastical power in enjoining these covenants. But abuse of things doth not alter their nature. God's ordinances are too often used in a carnal, sensual and devilish manner, without ever being rendered such themselves. It is only, as <HI>really religious covenants,</HI> and not as <HI>civil</HI> or <HI>state covenants,</HI> they can be adopt∣ed into ordination vows or baptismal engagements. And that they were such, the following arguments evince.</P>
<P N="1">1. The Covenanters themselves, who best knew their own intentions do, times without number, re∣present them as Vows, which their Confession de∣clares to be a <HI>religious ordinance,</HI> as <HI>covenants with God,</HI> which must be <HI>religious,</HI> if any dealings with him be so<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Chap.

<P N="2">2. Except perhaps in 1581, the church, in her Ge∣neral Assemblies, or Commissions, took the lead in promoting the covenanting work.

<P N="3">3. In A. D. 1596 and 1638, in which the covenan∣ting work was <HI>most delightfully</HI> carried on, in Scotland, the state had no influence at all in promoting it. Nay in 1638, the court did all it could, to oppose the covenanters procedure. Indeed our zealous an∣cestors in the preamble to their bond of that year quote many acts of Parliament in favours of that religion to which they engaged, and of the stedfast maintenance of it. But they never condsiered these acts as a part of their bond, or as a command to covenant in their manner; but as an evidence that they were doing nothing rebellious or treasonable, as their adversaries

pretended. Nay, till 1640, no act of Parliament en∣joined covenanting work.</P>

But that will no more prove, that they acted as <HI>civil judges,</HI> than that ministers, receiving an order from King or Par∣liament to observe a public fast, or hold a Synod, they must, in their fasting and judging work, renounce Christ's sole headship over his church, and adopt the magistrate into his place.—If it is pretended, that mi∣nisters marrying of persons is <HI>not a religious</HI> but <HI>civil</HI> work, I insist, that the marriage of Christians, which is to be <HI>only in the Lord,</HI>—to bring up an <HI>holy seed</HI> for Him and his church, and the family to be a <HI>church in the house,</HI> and the parties mutual duty copied from, and influenced by the example of Christ,—and as it is a <HI>covenant of God</HI> which is not like civil contracts, dis∣solvable by the will of parties, be plainly proven to be a <HI>merely civil</HI> and <HI>nowise religious</HI> bond.

5. There appears nothing in the origination of these covenants, which can prove them <HI>merely civil.</HI> No∣thing appears in the five bonds of our Reformers, in 1557, 1559, 1560, 1563, but may well accord to the na∣ture of a religious engagement. As Christians, and not merely as civil lords, they bound themselves,—chiefly to promote the true religion according to God's word.—Had K. James been not only the original adviser, but even the framer of the <HI>National Covenant,</HI> it might nevertheless have been a religious bond. The psalms which K. David penned and James versified, are not thereby rendered <HI>merely civil.</HI> The fast which K. Jehoshaphat appointed, and at which he publicly pray∣ed, was <HI>really religious,</HI> not <HI>merely civil.</HI> Our Con∣fessions of Faith and Protestant religion were not rendered <HI>merely civil,</HI> though in 1560 and 1690, the State took the lead in the ratification and establishment before any General Assembly of these periods. It is not improbable, that the ministers of the church had a principal hand in the origination of our national covenant. In 1580, James was about fourteen years of age, and by no transcendent genius, qualified for the work. Just before, and quickly after, we find him marking his hatred of true reformation. His ruling favourites were not a little suspected and com∣plained of, by the zealous clergy, as addicted to Po∣pery.—Through the tearing out of the minutes of four sessions of the Assembly, October 1580, by some parasite of the court, Calderwood's history, at least his printed abridgment, is imperfect on this period. He only says, that <Q REND="inline">"the second Confession of Faith, i. e. <HI>national covenant,</HI> commonly called the King's Confession, was subscribed by the King and his hous∣hold, i. e. <HI>privy council,</HI> January 28th, 158<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, which is but an appendix to the First, i e. <HI>Scotch Confession,</HI> and comprehends it; and so both are one,—that a charge was subscribed by the King, March 2d, where∣by subjects of all ranks were charged to subscribe the Confession, (national covenant) and requiring mini∣sters to demand said subscription, and to censure such as refused.—The General Assembly in April ap∣proved the said Confession, and enjoined the subscrip∣tion of it.—The Assembly in October peremptorily

<P>The origination of the Solemn League and Cove∣nant was equally consistent with a <HI>religious vow.</HI> Not a few of the most pious clergymen in England had all along, from Elizabeth's establishment of the Protestant religion, hated part of the ceremonies, and the lord∣ly power of the bishops. Many of these, driven from their charge, by the Prelatical persecution, under Eli∣zabeth and James, and Charles I had been compas∣sionately taken into the families of great men, for the education of their children. Their instruction and e∣xample were remarkably blessed, for rendering their pupils and others intelligent and pious. They per∣ceived the encroachments made upon their religion and liberties by Abp. Laud and his assistants, and not a few of them conceived a strong relish for what was then called Puritanism. The success of the Scotch covenanters, in their struggles with the tyrannical court, made many of the English wish and hope for a similar deliverance. In their treaty with Charles 1641, the Scots requested, that the English should be brought to a reformed uniformity with themselves in religion. The Scotch ministers, who attended their Commissio∣ners at London, in forming that treaty of peace, by their instructions and example, recommended their Presbyterian reformation not a little to many of the most learned and pious of the English. A correspon∣dence for promoting a religious uniformity between the two churches was carried on by a number of the English clergymen with the Scotch Assemblies, 1641, 1642, 1643; and by the English parliament with the Assemblies, 1642, 1643. At their request, the As∣sembly appointed Messrs Henderson, Rutherford, Gil∣lespy and others, to assist the Westminster Assembly in compiling <HI>ecclesiastical Standards,</HI> of doctrine, wor∣ship, discipline and government. Alarmed by the terrible massacre of the Protestants in Ireland, and re∣duced to stra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ts in their war with K. Charles, the English Parliament requested, that for promoting and
<PB N="113" REF="113"/>
establishing uniformity in religion, and preserving their respective liberties, the two nations might be more closely connected by a mutual League. The Letter from a multitude of English ministers,—the papers from the English parliament and their Commissioners, and the Scotch Assembly's answers, manifest that an uniformity of religion was the principal thing propos∣ed by this League. Henry Vane and perhaps some o∣ther English Commissioners, nevertheless, from a dis∣like of the Scotch Presbyterianism, thought to have gone no further than a <HI>civil</HI> league, but the Scots be∣ing positive for a <HI>religious</HI> one, he yielded It appear∣ed from that readiness and avidity, with which the Solemn League was received in England, that it an∣swered to the wishes of his constituents.

The preservation of the King's person and authority, and of the rights and privileges of the parliament and nation was promised as a thing subordinated to the interests of religion, in which view, it is a very necessary and important branch of practical Christianity, Rom. xiii. 1,—8. 1 Pet. ii. 13, 17.

Phil. iii. 3, 8,—14. The covenanting sea∣sons being remarkable for trouble or danger,—the out pouring of the Holy Ghost,—and deep convicti∣ons of sin, are precisely those marked out for that work in scripture, Joel ii 12, 13.

<P N="10">10 The remarkable effusion of the Spirit of God, which attended the swearing of these covenants, for the conviction, conversion, and confirmation of mul∣titudes, fixing in their hearts such a deep sense of reli∣gion, as all the profaneness and persecution of twenty eight years could not eradicate,—is no contemptible evidence that He looked upon them as religious, not merely state covenants. It is at our infinite hazard, if we call that <HI>common and unclean,</HI> which God hath so singularly honoured.</P>
<P>OBJECT. I. <Q REND="inline">"Our Covenanters characterizing themselves <HI>Noblemen, Barons, Burgesses</HI> and <HI>Commons,</HI>

proves their covenants to be <HI>mere civil covenants.</HI>"</Q> ANSW. Will then others characterizing themselves <HI>ministers</HI> render them, at the same time, <HI>church-cove∣nants?</HI> Hath Solomon's denominating himself King of Israel, in his Proverbs and Ecclesiastes, rendered these two books merely civil, not religious? If, in a Bond or Bill, I denominate myself <HI>minister of the gos∣pel,</HI> Will that render the Bond or Bill religious and ecclesiastical? (2.) As they never used such charac∣ters in their bonds, but when they covenanted contra∣ry to their King's will, they probably intended no more by them, than merely to mark the great harmo∣ny of all ranks, for the encouragement of their friends, and the terror of their malicious enemies. (3.) There was no irreligion, in subjecting themselves and all their honours to the service of Jesus Christ, as made of God Head over all things to his Church, Revel. xxi. 24.</P>
<P>OBJECT. II. <Q REND="inline">"In 1638, and 1643, they framed their covenants to admit Episcopalians and Indepen∣dents, whom they would not have admitted to the sacraments."</Q> ANSW. As in taking these covenants, men bound themselves to the regular reformation of every thing found sinful, when tried by the word of God, our ancestors agreeable to Rom. xiv. 1. Isaiah xxxv. 3, 4. were willing to help forward the weak, and admit to their covenant and church fellowship, every person, who appeared willing to receive more light. even though they were not in every respect, e∣qually enlightened and reformed as themselves. But, I defy you to prove, that they excluded one upright covenanter from their religious communion. (2.) The covenants of 1638 and 1643, were not framed to admit any who resolved obstinately to adhere to Episcopacy or Independency. In the bond of 1638, men bound themselves to forbear the practice of Episcopa∣lian government, and of the articles of Perth, till they should be TRIED and ALLOWED in a free General Assembly. The covenanters declare, that their inten∣tion in that bond, was against all innovations and corruptions<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Stevenson's hist. P. 351.</BIBL></NOTE>. In the covenant of 1643, that para∣graph,
<PB N="119" REF="119"/>
which peculiarly respected the Protestants in England and Ireland was prudently suited to the weakness of many of them. But there is nothing in it, which favours either Episcopacy or Independen∣cy. The preservation of the reformation attained in Scotland sworn to, excluded them both. If then E∣rastians or Independents, and others dissembled with God, and their brethren, in taking it, they, not the covenant, are blameable. Mens hypocritical recepti∣on of the sacraments will not render them <HI>civil</HI> ordi∣nances. (3.) You can never prove, that the covenant of 1538 was tendered to the Doctors of Aberdeen, after they had shown their obstinate attachment to Prelacy. Or that Philip Nye, or any others, after manifesting their obstinate attachment to Independen∣cy, had the covenant of 1643, tendered to them by any truly zealous covenanter. Baillie affirms, that the Scots were peremptory against keeping open a door to Independency in England<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Committee of Westminster Ass. answers to Independen's, p. 106,—112.

<P>OBJECT. III. <Q REND="inline">"The imposition of these covenants under civil penalties, proves them to have been mere∣ly state covenants."</Q> ANSW. No more than the re∣quirement of men under civil penalties, to partake, at least once a year, of the Lord's Supper, rendered it a merely civil ordinance. An ordinance may re∣main <HI>religious,</HI> though a civil sanction should be sin∣fully annexed to it. (2.) If, which I do not, you be∣lieve, that Asa and Josiah, by penal laws, compelled men to take their covenants, you can scarce condemn our covenanters annexing civil penalties to the refusal of their bonds, especially as they knew, it would scarce come from any, but such as were malignant ene∣mies to the civil as well as religious liberties of the na∣tion. (3.) In 1596, 1638, 1648, and 1649, these covenants had no penalty either civil or ecclesiastical annexed to the not swearing of them, without any hint from the covenanters, that this altered the na∣ture of the engagement.</P>
<P>OBJECT. IV. <Q REND="inline">"Our ancestors gave up with their covenanting work, whenever they got the state of the
<PB N="120" REF="120"/>
nation settled by means of it; and having got their civil liberties otherwise secured at the Revolution, they never covenanted at all."</Q> ANSW. (1.) Did ten years of murderous invasion and outrageous conten∣tion, and twenty-eight years of horrible profaneness and persecution make our nation so happy, that co∣venanting with God our deliverer was no more nece∣ssary? Or, Have the fearful profanation of the name of God by unnecessary and wicked oaths, or the shocking bribery and perjury, too common in the e∣lection of our Representatives in Parliament, and our other outrageous abominations, rendered Britain so holy, that these covenants need no more be regard∣ed? (2.) Not the alteration of the national affairs to the better, but the alteration of mens hearts to the worse, made covenanting with God to be so contemned at the Restoration and Revolution.</P>
<P N="3">III. That these <HI>solemn</HI> and <HI>religious</HI> covenants with God, in which all gross heresy, blasphemy, idolatry, Popery, and other abominations have been repeatedly abjured, bind not only the immediate swearers or sub∣scribers, but <HI>all their posterity and other representees, in all generations following, to a saithful performance of every thing engaged,</HI> must now be demonstrated.</P>
<P N="1">1. That which is engaged in these covenants, being moral duty, commanded by the law of God, is of <HI>perpetual obligation.</HI> The whole faith and practice to which we therein engage are stated from the oracles of God, in our excellent Standards. If the matter in itself, were contrary to God's law, no human cove∣nant could bind us, or any represented by us, to it for a moment. We can have no power from God to bind ourselves or others to any thing sinful, 2 Cor. xiii. 8. Nor can any human deed be valid in opposi∣tion to his supreme authority.—If the matter were indifferent, no vow or promissory oath could lawful∣ly constitute a <HI>perpetual obligation,</HI> as the alteration of circumstances might render it very unexpedient and unedifying, 1 Cor. vi. 12. &amp; x. 23. &amp; xvi. 14 Rom. xiv. 19. But if that which is engaged, be precisely, what every person, in every age or circumstance, is
<PB N="121" REF="121"/>
bound to, by the antecedent tie of the law of God, no man can be, in the least, abridged of any lawful liberty, by being brought under the most solemn obli∣gation of an oath or vow.—The strictest fulfilment of it cannot but tend to the real profit of every one concerned, both in his personal and his social capaci∣ty, Psal. xix. 11. 1 Cor. xv. 58. Isa iii. 10. Proverbs xiv. 34. Rom. ii. 1,—10. It is therefore for the ad∣vantage of us and our posterity, to be hedged in, and bound up to the most exact conformity to God's law, by every mean which he requires or allows, in his word,—even as it is for our advantage to have our li∣berty bounded by the ledges of bridges.—The law of God requires us to do every thing which is calculat∣ed to promote or secure our own or our children's walking in the truth, Gen. xvii. 7. Psal. xlv. 17. &amp; lxxviii 1,—9 Isa. xxxviii. 19 3 John, ver. 4.—It re∣presents solemn vows as a mean most effectual to an∣swer this purpose, Psal. cxix. 106. &amp; lxxvi. 11. &amp; l. 14. &amp; lvi. 12. &amp; lxvi. 13, 14. &amp; lxi. 8. &amp; cxvi. 12,—19. &amp; cxxxii. 1,—5.

<P N="2">2. By the repeated judicial acts of both church and state, approving and imposing these covenants, they were constituted the <HI>adopted laws</HI> of both, proper to be acknowledged and submitted to, by all their mem∣bers, in the most solemn manner, which their circum∣stances permitted.—Several of these acts, as well as the best duties of Christians, had their sinful infirmities particularly on the head of penalties, which I mean not to defend. But in so far as these acts approved and authorized these covenants, which bound men to receive and hold fast such temporal and spiritual pri∣vileges, as God had given them, and thankfully im∣prove them to his glory,—and required a Christian, regular, and seasonable taking of them,—they were certainly good and valid. Being good in themselves, and the exact performance of them calculated to pro∣mote the glory of God, and eminent welfare of both church and state, these covenants, if once regularly
<PB N="122" REF="122"/>
adopted as laws, must remain obligatory upon the a∣dopting societies, while they exist. Civil rulers being ordained <HI>ministers of God for good</HI> to men, Rom. xiii. 1,—4. and church officers appointed by Christ for the <HI>edifying of his body,</HI> Eph. iv. 11,—14. have no power against the truth, but for the truth, 2 Corinth. xiii. 8, 10. and so can no more repeal a law, which promotes only that which is morally good, any more than they can give validity to a sinful one.—These covenants must therefore, in the view of God and conscience, continue binding, as laws divinely ratifi∣ed, upon us, as subjects, and as Christians. But it is their much more solemn obligation as <HI>public Vows</HI> and <HI>Covenants with God,</HI> which I mean to establish, par∣ticularly with reference to Scotland.</P>
<P N="3">3. The matter of these vows being morally good, calculated to promote the holiness and happiness of e∣very person in every age, the immediate covenanters were such as laid every possible foundation of trans∣mitting the obligation of their vow to the whole church and nation, to all generations. The REPRESENTA∣TIVES of both church and state,—the MAJORITY of the Society, and our own PARENTS, in their respec∣tive stations, took these covenants. What could tran∣smit and extend an obligation to posterity, if all this did not? You cannot but allow, that even in private civil deeds, the obligation is extended far beyond the <HI>immediate engagers.</HI> In bonds, respecting money or service, men bind not only themselves, but their suc∣cessors, and assigns, especially, if they have the con∣tinued right to, or possession of that fund or property from which that money or service natively ariseth. The obligations contained in a call to a minister, fix on the whole congregation, if subscribed by the majority, without any regular dissent,—and on such as after∣wards accede to it. The treaties of peace, traffick, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> contracted by Kings, Parliaments, Magistrates, are held binding on their subjects, and even on their posterity. They, who accede to any society, fall un∣der the binding force of its social engagements for debt, duty, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> If bonds and covenants did only bind immediate contractors, nothing but the wildest disorder would ensue. If the immediate engagers,
<PB N="123" REF="123"/>
quickly after died, they who trusted to their engage∣ment, might be totally ruined.—A minority, who had been silent during the transaction, might, in a few days, overturn a bond or contract of the majori∣ty. Subjects might, at their pleasure, render void the contracts and treaties of their rulers. To pretend, that men may not use the same freedom, in binding their representees and posterity to God, as in binding them to men, is highly absurd and shocking, as it represents God as more dangerous, and less honoura∣ble and useful to be dealt with, than the very worst of men. Why may not a parent, in offering his child to God in baptism, take hold of God to be his God, and the God of his seed after him to all generations,—and dedicate not only that child, but all his poste∣rity to God, as his honoured vassals and servants, Gen. xvii. 7. Acts ii. 39.?—Is this less dutiful, safe, or honourable, than to infeft himself and them in some earthly property, and bind them as possessors of it, to be the vassals of some sinful superior?—If the majority of a society, especially in distress, may put the whole under the authority and protection of a man who is a great sinner, why must they act either wickedly or foolishly, if, by a solemn dedication, they put it under the especial care and protection of the Great GOD our Saviour? Rev. xi. 15. Psal. ii. 12. &amp; xxii. 27. If the representatives of a people, may bind them to live peaceably and trade honestly with earthly neighbours; or may, in some cases, sub∣ject them to the power, laws, or exactions of other earthly superiors,—why allow them no power to stu∣dy peace with God, and to follow peace with all men and holiness?—No power to surrender them to God, to be ruled by his law,—and to render him his due re∣venues of honour?—Hath not God an original and supreme right to all men as his creatures, subjects, and children? Are they not all bound by his law to the whole of that duty, to which, we contend, any man ought to be bound by a vow of <HI>perpetual obliga∣tion?</HI> Is it not inexpressibly honourable, safe and pro∣fitable to stand under the special care of, and in rela∣tion to God in Christ, Deut. iv. 7. &amp; xxxiii. 29,?
<PB N="124" REF="124"/>
Why then more shy of devoting posterity, or other representees to him, than to a sinful man and his ser∣vice?</P>
<P>In covenants with men, a proper and timely dissent may frequently be well founded; and may effectually divert this obligation from the dissenters. But how there could be a lawful dissent from an engagement carefully to keep all the commandments of God and nothing else, I know not. Had the whole, or even the body of the Hebrew nation, timely and regularly dissented from the treaty made by their princes with the Gibeonites, it might have diverted its obligation from them.—Inslead of this, they appear to have a∣greed to the final stating of it, without a single mur∣mur, Josh. ix. But, if these princes had, by cove∣nant, devoted themselves and their tribes to a careful keeping of God's commandments; I know not how the people's dissent could have diverted the obligation from themselves.—In covenants with men, the non-fulfilment of some condition or some dispensation or remission may weaken, if not perfectly annul, the ob∣ligation. But none can dispense with, or grant re∣missions, in the matters of God. Covenants made with God are more absolute, and less clogged with conditions, and so <HI>more obliging</HI> The covenants of which we now treat, being about indispensible duties of morality, upon which dependeth the glory of God, the advancement of the kingdom of Jesus Christ, the honour and happiness of magistrates, and the public liberty, safety and peace of the nation, and the good of posterity in all time coming, ought to have their obligation allowed to fix, wherever any ground can be found, while Christ hath a kingdom, and the cove∣nanters a posterity, particularly in Scotland; for,</P>
<P N="1">(1.) Our civil Representatives by these covenants devoted themselves in their station, and their subjects, in so far as under their power, to the service of God. In 1581 and 1590, King James and his privy council took the <HI>National Covenant,</HI> and required their sub∣jects to follow their example. In 1638, the privy council again took it, as it stood in 1581. In 1640, the members of Parliament took it, as explained by the Assembly 1638, to abjure <HI>Prelacy</HI> and the <HI>five ar∣ticles</HI>
<PB N="125" REF="125"/>
<HI>of Perth,</HI> and appointed it to be sworn by all the members of every future Parliament. It was sworn by the members of Parliament 1644. In 1649, the national covenant, and the Solemn League which was materially the same, were renewed by the members of Parliament, with solemn fasting and humiliation. The oath framed in 1641, to be sworn by members of Par∣liament, at taking their seats, expresly approved the national covenant. King Charles I. gave a solemn approbation of it. King Charles II. and other magis∣trates took the covenants in 1650 and 1651. Now, if a covenant made by the princes of Israel with the representatives of the Gibeonites, in a matter which concerned the <HI>Lord's land</HI> and the <HI>remote service os his altar,</HI> extended its obligation to the whole nation of Israel, who consented to it, no otherwise, than by si∣lence at the final stating of it,—and to their posterity, for many generations,—that four hundred years after, they were punished with a famine on account of Saul's breach of it, Josh. ix. with 2 Sam. xxi. and to the Gibeonites and their posterity;—Why not allow the covenanting deed of our Princes to extend its obliga∣tion in like manner? If magistrates be the <HI>ministers of God for good</HI> to men, Why should they not be ca∣pable to surrender themselves and their subjects to the special care and service of God, their common and beneficent Superior? If they possess the powers assign∣ed them in our excellent Standards, Why may they not, as <HI>nursing sathers</HI> of the church, devote them∣selves and their subjects of the same true religion, to the enjoyment of God himself in his oracles and or∣dinances, and to serve Him regularly in Christ? If Joshua could bind himself and his family to serve the Lord, why may not magistrates bind themselves and their subjects of the same true religion, to receive and hold fast the like honour and happiness? If for the benefit of their subjects, magistrates may, in a time of need, subject themselves and their people to some powerful Monarch, whose fury is terrible, but his fa∣vour extremely profitable, or may approve and ratify some former grant of that kind,—Why may they not for the same end, devote themselves and subjects to the Great GOD our Saviour, and Prince of the kings
<PB N="126" REF="126"/>
of the earth? Why may they not bring their glory in∣to the church? and as judges kiss the Son of God, solemnly approving and in their station ratifying that grant which his Father made to him, of the outer∣most ends of the earth? Rev. xxi. 24. &amp; xi. 15. Prov. viii. 15, 16, Psal. ii. 8,—12.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) In these covenants our Representatives in the church, in their station, devoted themselves and their people to the faith, profession and obedience of Christ. In April 1581, the General Assembly unanimously approved the <HI>national covenant,</HI> and then in October ensuing, in the name of Christ, appointed it to be sub∣scribed by all Protestants. In 1588 and 1590, they made further acts for promoting this subscription. The general Assemblies of 1596, 1638, 1639, and the Commissions or Assemblies of 1643, 1644, 1648, 1649, enjoined the swearing of the covenant by all a∣dult church-members. I do not know of one Presby∣terian minister or ruling elder in Scotland, who, in a∣ny of the covenanting periods of 1581, 1590, 1596, 1638, 1643, 1648, declined taking it. Now, if ci∣vil representatives may bind their subjects and their posterity by civil contracts, Why ought not the har∣monious dedication of themselves and people to God, by church-rulers to have a like binding force? If, in public prayers, ministers may devote themselves and congregations to Christ, why may not they and ruling elders conjunctly do it, by public covenant? But we do not chiefly rest the matter on these grounds; for,</P>
<P N="3">(3.) It is beyond all contradiction, that the lawful and public covenants civil or religious, which are made by parents, do bind their posterity. The oath of Esau, in which he resigned his birthright to Jacob, bound his posterity never to attempt recovering the privileges of it, from Jacob or his descendents. Hence Esau and his family, after the death of Isaac, remov∣ed intirely from Canaan, Gen. xxv. 33. &amp; xxxvi. 6. Even the public curse, which the Jews took upon themselves and their children, hath been manifestly binding on them these seventeen hundred years past, Mat. xxvii 25. The vow of parents in the antient circumcision, or the Christian baptism of their infants,
<PB N="127" REF="127"/>
extends to these children,—nay according to the ex∣tent of God's covenant and promise to all their future seed, Gen. xvii. 7. Acts ii. 38, 39. Hence, what∣ever any of them do contrary to that vow, must at once be perfidy and rebellion against God. Nor will their wilful or slothful ignorance of that obligation, or their non-consent to it, when grown up, free them from that guilt, any more than ignorance of Adam's covenant, or of the breach of it, can free his posterity from the guilt of his first sin, or from perfidy in their personal violations of that covenant of works. In Deut. v. 2, 3. God, by Moses declares, that the co∣venant made with the Israelites at Sinai, was not made with them only, but with all that new generation of their children and grand children, who survived them, Num. xxvi. 64.—In Deut. xxix. 14, 15. he declares, that the covenant taken by that new genera∣tion in the plains of Moab, did not only bind them who were alive and present at the entrance into it, but also others, even their posterity.—Their covenant with the Gibeonites did not only bind the immediate engagers and consenters, but also their posterity, ma∣ny ages afterward, Josh. ix. 15, 19. with 2 Sam. xxi. 1.—Now, these covenants of allegiance to God and duty to men, of which we are treating, were sworn and subscribed by our own <HI>natural,</HI> tho' now <HI>mediate</HI> parents, and when it is considered, how FREQUENT∣LY that covenant, the same in substance in the seve∣ral Bonds, was sworn or subscribed, and how GENE∣RALLY;—and how readily some covenanted on one occasion, whose ancestors had not on a preceding;—and how families have been since intermixed, it will scarce remain probable, that there is a Scotchman, at least on the continent of Britain or Ireland, who is not descended from some covenanter. If any, to his own disgrace, will contend that in all these and diffe∣rent periods of covenanting 1581, 1590, 1596, 1638, 1639, 1643, 1648, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> all his progenitors were such mere neutrals, or malignant opposers of the true reli∣gion and liberties of the country, that none of them took the covenant, let him take heed, lest, after all, God his Creditor find him a perjured transgressor of the covenant of his fathers,—or at least, of the cove∣nant
<PB N="128" REF="128"/>
made by his church and nation, and their respec∣tive Representatives.</P>
<P N="4">(4.) That lawful covenants, made by the greater part of a society bind the whole, and every future acceder to it,—at least, unless the minority or acceders have, by a proper dissent, diverted the obligation from themselves;—and that, if remarkably calculated to promote the common advantage, they bind the mem∣bers of it, while it continues a society,—Common sense will not allow us to doubt. That the exact ful∣filment of our covenants with God, is remarkably cal∣culated to promote the honour of Christ and his Fa∣ther, and the welfare of both church and state, hath been formerly hinted. No person therefore could, or can, by any lawful dissent, divert their binding force from himself. Nor do I remember of any, who regularly attempted it in Scotland.</P>
<P>Without doubt, the majority, nay body of the Scotch nation nation entered into their Solemn Cove∣nant with God. In 1581, both the privy council and the General Assembly, in their respective acts enjoined the taking of the National Covenant. <Q REND="inline">"In this year, in the month of March, was the National Covenant solemnly taken by the king, his council and court, and afterwards by the inhabitants of the kingdom<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Brown's <HI>Apologetical Relation,</HI> P. 17.</BIBL></NOTE>."

<P>If then, the matter being moral duty, was proper for a covenant of perpetual obligation; if the cove∣nanters had full power to bind the whole society and their posterity; if the subject upon which the obligati∣on was laid be permanent; if the end of the covenan∣ters and their covenant was to fix the obligation upon posterity, as well as upon the immediate engagers; and if they did every thing in their power to render that obligation solemn and permanent, What surther evidence of the perpetuity of that obligation can any man demand, who singly regards the honour of God, or the welfare of this church and nation?

OBJECT. I. <Q REND="inline">"Many things were wrong in the imposing and taking of these covenants; and their words are ill chosen, as to <HI>extirpate</HI> Popery, Prelacy, <HI>i. e.</HI> to kill Papists and Prelatists."</Q> ANSW. (1) Let us allow no malignant enemy or perjured violator of these covenants to be held a sufficient witness against them. Nor let us have the long ago refuted calum∣nies of such men revived upon their mere authority. (2) Though the covenant had had insirmities, even infirmities sufficient to have hindered the swearing of it, as the Doctors of Aberdeen and Oxford pretend∣ed, was the case,—it may nevertheless bind when once it is sworn. Though its matter had been in part sin∣ful and self-contradictory, it would bind to the part which was lawful.—Though the authority which imposed it, had been insufficient, and the manner of imposing it improper, it would bind when once sworn. Zedekiah was in some respect compelled to swear al∣legiance to Nebuchadnezzar, whose sovereignty over Judah was very disputable, yet his oath bound him, Ezek. xvii. 12,—19. 2 Chron. xxxvi. 13.—Though our covenanters ends had been carnal, or even sinful, the oath, as far as lawful in its matter, is binding, when once it is sworn.—Without allowing these things as <HI>fixed principles,</HI> no oaths or covenants could be any securities among mankind. (3) If Popery and Prelacy be plants which God hath not planted, why may we not, as lawfully, in our stations, endeavour to <HI>extirpate</HI> or <HI>root</HI> them out, as we may mortify the deeds of our body, that we may live? The one in∣cludes no more violence against mens persons than the other, Rom. viii. 13. Do you imagine, that the co∣venanters swore to cut their own throats, or tear out their own hearts, when they engaged to endeavour, in their station, to extirpate <HI>every thing contrary to the power of godliness,</HI> as indwelling sin, vain thoughts, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which adhere to believers in this life, certainly are.</P>
<P>OBJECT. II. <Q REND="inline">"Many in England and Ireland never took the Solemn League, or took it in a sense consis∣tent with Prelacy or Independency."</Q> ANSW. I do not expect that any hater of that covenant will ever be able to invalidate the proof which hath been given of the number
<PB N="148" REF="148"/>
of the covenanters in both these kingdoms. (2.) The covenanters declared <Q REND="inline">"that an oath is to be taken in the plain sense of the words, without equivocation or mental reservation.—It cannot bind to sin; but in a∣ny thing not sinful, being taken, it binds to perfor∣mance, although to a man's own hurt<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Confession of Faith, chap. XXII. 4.</BIBL></NOTE>."</Q> All but Jesuits profess the same principle. And indeed if oaths, vows, or covenants bind not men, according to the plain meaning of their words, they become quite use∣less. Mens prevarication therefore, in favours of Pre∣lacy or Independency, cannot free them from the ob∣ligation of an oath, which strikes against both. (3) As the Scots stood bound by their National Covenant to every duty contained in the Solemn League, long before the English had a thought of covenanting a∣long with them, and did also swear the solemn league, no neglect or prevarication of either English or Irish can free us from our obligation. It was neither to the English nor to the Irish, but chiefly to the faithful and unchangeable God of all grace, that our fathers bound themselves and their seed. The Assembly in their <HI>Letter to the council of London,</HI> justly observe, <Q REND="inline">"It is not in the power of any human authority to absolve you from adhering to this so solemnly sworn League and Covenant."</Q> And in another letter, <Q REND="inline">"The cove∣nant hath been broken by many in both kingdoms.—We do not doubt, but there are <HI>many seven thou∣sands</HI> in England, who have retained their integrity in that business."</Q> And in their <HI>Warning</HI> 1648, <Q REND="inline">"The violation of the covenant by some in England doth not set us free from the obligation of it. No laws, nor authority on earth can absolve us from so solemn an obligation to the Most High.—We are not acquit∣ted from the obligation of our solemn covenants be∣cause of the troubles.—In the worst of times, all those duties whereunto by covenant, we oblige our∣selves, do still ly upon us.—We have sworn, and we must perform it."</Q> And in their <HI>Warning</HI> 1649, <Q REND="inline">"Al∣beit the League and Covenant be despised by that pre∣vailing party in England, yet the obligation of that covenant is <HI>perpetual;</HI> and all the duties contained
<PB N="149" REF="149"/>
therein are constantly to be minded and prosecuted, by every one of us and our <HI>posterity,</HI> according to their place and station."</Q> And in their <HI>Letter to breth∣ren in England,</HI> <Q REND="inline">"Although there were none in the one kingdom, who did adhere to the covenant, yet were not the other kingdom, nor any person in either of them, absolved from the bond thereof; since in it, we have not only sworn by the Lord, but also cove∣nanted with him. It is not the failing of one or more that can absolve others from their duty or TIE to him. Besides, the duties therein contained being in them∣selves lawful, and the grounds of our TIE thereto moral, though others forget their duty, yet doth not their defection free us from that obligation which lies upon us by the covenants, in our places and stations. The covenant being intended as one of the best means of stedfastness, it were strange to say, that the back∣slidings of any should absolve others from the TIE thereof, especially seeing our engagement therein is <HI>not only national,</HI> but personal.—All these kingdoms joining together to abolish that oath by law, could not dispense therewith, much less can any one of them, or any party in either do the same.—(They are) testi∣monies which the Lord Christ hath entred as protesta∣tions, to preserve his right in these ends of the earth, long ago given unto him for his possession, and of late confirmed by solemn covenant."</Q></P>
<P>OBJECT. III. <Q REND="inline">"The influence of the Highland thiefs, and the gross ignorance of the Scotch islands, together with the general dislike of the covenant at the Restoration and Revolution, are <HI>internal eviden∣ces,</HI> that but a part, perhaps a small part, of the Scots took the covenant."</Q> ANSW. I boldly defy you to in∣validate the proofs I have brought to the contrary. Nay, for ought I know, you cannot produce one of these perjured Prelatists, that pretended that only the smaller part of the Scotch nation took the covenant, especially in 1590, 1638, &amp; 1643. (2.) Were the Highland chiefs, and the gross ignorance of the islan∣ders, occasioned by the negligence of the curates, a whit more able to withstand the enlightening and heart-bowing power of God, so remarkably manifest∣ed on these occasions, than K. Charles and many o∣thers
<PB N="150" REF="150"/>
on the continent? Have we not produced evi∣dence that multitudes of the Highlanders entered into the reformers covenant, 1638, and were not Argyle, Mar, and many other Highland chiefs zealous cove∣nanters? Did not such as were otherwise minded take the covenant of 1581, as imposed by the Privy coun∣cil according to its original meaning? Did not even the Doctors and Prelatic inhabitants of Aberdeen take that bond, without approving the council's limitation of it to its original meaning? (3) You can produce no evidence that the covenanting work was not carried on in the Scotch islands, but such as we have, that ne∣ver a Hebrew child was circumcised on the 8th day, from Isaac to John Baptist;—or that never a weekly Sabbath was observed from the creation till the manna fell around the Hebrew camp, <HI>i. e.</HI> want of positive evidence to the contrary,—and that too in places, of which, to this moment, we have little account, except what relates to their situation, soil, product, or the like. (4.) It is highly absurd to pretend, that the so general disregard of the covenants, twelve or forty years after the last taking of them, is <HI>internal evidence</HI> that few had taken them. Will it irrefragably prove, that Adam was never made after the image of God, or taken into covenant with him, because within a few days or hours he had become a sinner, hating both God and his covenant.—or that devils were never created holy and happy, because within a few days they had left their first estate? Will the gene∣ral concurrence of the Hebrews in worshipping the gol∣den calf, prove that they had not entered into solemn covenant with God, about forty days before? Will their subsequent apostasies, prove that but few of them had covenanted with God, under Joshua, Asa, Joash, Hezekiah, Josiah, Ezra and Nehemiah? Will Peter's fearfully heinous and repeated denial of Christ, prove that he had not, a few hours before, solemnly engaged against it?</P>
<P>OBJECT. IV. <Q REND="inline">"Force or fear caused many to cove∣nant."</Q> ANSW. Though force or sear should have rendered the manner of covenanting unacceptable to God, they cannot render void an oath which is sworn. (2.) I will never contend, that the penalty annexed by
<PB N="151" REF="151"/>
law to the refusal of the covenant in 1643, or even on some other occasions, was proper. But, after a labo∣rious search, I find no proper evidence, that any force was ever used in Scotland to make any take the cove∣nant, except in 1639, by Montrose and Monro, two military men, without any warrant from either church or state,—the former, if not both of whom afterward turned out a malignant murderer of his covenanting brethren. Never, Sir, pick up or retail the mere in∣ventions of perjured violators of these covenants, who were glad to say any thing to conceal or excuse their own wickedness. (3.) In 1638, when the covenanting was most universal, the bishops and some other anti∣covenanters, afraid of prosecution for their enormous debts, or for their oppressive and other wicked deeds,—and perhaps chiefly to calumniate the covenanters at court, did flee their country. But none were obli∣ged to do so for refusing the covenant. Fear of dan∣ger probably restrained some from reviling a Bond which the nation so highly esteemed But none, that I know of, were thereby constrained to swear it. Some mobs happened, occasioned by the king's suspension of the common exercise of the civil law, and the sitting of its courts. But these were detested by the zealous covenanters, and not one of them appears either to have been intended, or to have issued in favours of the covenant. If the influences of God's Spirit, and the affecting appearances of his Providence—as at Sinai or in the apostolic age, awed or allured numbers to take the covenant whose hearts were not sincere before him,—should we quarrel with the Almighty on that ac∣count?—But, Sir, Henderson, Dickson, and Cant, who being the principal leaders of the covenanting work that year, affirm to the doctors of Aberdeen, who were eager to have detected them of falsehood, if it had been possible, <Q REND="inline">"No pastors in our knowledge have been either forced to flee or have been threatened with the want of their stipends for refusing their sub∣scription; but some have of their own accord, gone to court for procuring protection against their credi∣tors,—and have made lies between the king and his people. Others have wilfully refused to abide with their flocks, for no reason, but because the people
<PB N="152" REF="152"/>
have subscribed.—Arguments have been taken from (promised) augmentation of stipends to hinder sub∣scription. Fear of worldly loss rather hinders men to subscribe, than scruples of conscience.—The prelates flight seems rather to have proceeded from inward fu∣ries of accusing consciences, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>—In this day of the Lord's power, his people have <HI>most willingly offered</HI> themselves in multitudes like the dew of the morning. Others, of no small note, have offered their subscrip∣tions, and have been refused till time should try their fincerity, from love to the cause, and <HI>not from the fear of man.</HI> No threatenings have been used, except of the deserved judgments of God, nor force, except the force of reason from the high respects which we owe to religion, to our king, to our native country, to ourselves, and to our posterity<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><BIBL>Answers to doctors of Aberdeen, P. 42, 44.</BIBL></P>
<P>The General Assembly 1649, in their act, Ses. 19th, appear so far from forcing men into their covenant, that they earnest∣ly enjoin and appoint the utmost caution to be used for preven∣ting such persons taking of it as did not sincerely approve it, and resolve to prosecute the ends of it.</P></NOTE>."</Q> (4.) Since the covenanting work was so remarkably countenanced by the Holy Ghost,—attended with perhaps more sincere mourning for sin,—more serious repentance and solid conversion to God, than hath within an equal space of time and place, happened any where in the world, since the apostolic age,—and since the covenanters in their vow deponed, that they covenanted <HI>without any world∣ly respect or inducement,</HI> as far as human in firmity would allow,—Take heed, Sir, lest after your objection hath manifested the carnality, selfishness, and dissimu∣lation of your own religious appearances.—God, at last, should publicly expose you as a blasphemer of his great work, and a malicious slanderer of his peo∣ple, as <HI>wilfully perjured.</HI></P>
<P>OBJECT. V. <Q REND="inline">"It is impossible our covenanters could understand their bonds, particularly in that which relates to Popery in the <HI>notional covenant,</HI> or to prelacy in the <HI>solemn league.</HI>"</Q> ANSW. Ignorance indeed hin∣ders a right and acceptable swearing of oaths or cove∣nants, but cannot invalidate their binding force if once they be sworn; otherwise millions in Britain would,

through ignorance; be freed from all their solemn en∣gagements in Baptism and the Lord's supper; and thousands freed from all obligation of their oaths of allegiance or fidelity to magistrates; or even their oaths to declare the truth and nothing else, in witness bearing. Candidates for the ministry needed but keep themselves in a great measure ignorant of the doctrines of the Confession of Faith and duties of the ministeri∣al office, in order to render their ordination vows or subscriptions <HI>altogether unobligatory.</HI> (2.) Being trai∣ned up in the abominations of popery or prelacy, or having frequent access to witness them, our covenan∣ting ancestors, who had common sense, might have more knowledge of them, than most clergymen in Scotland now have; even as a common sailor, who hath served 20 years in a man of war, may have more knowledge of her tackling and other pertinents, than all the learned doctors of fix British universities.</P>
<P>OBJECT.

neither Adam, nor Christ as Mediator, could bind themselves to fulfil God's law; and so there must be no proper, no real covenant of works or of grace; and so no religion among mankind. And, for the same reason, the promises of God, in so far as their matter corresponds to his natural excellencies can have <HI>no binding</HI> force; and thus the foundation of our faith and hope is quite overturned. All engagements in Baptism or the Lord's Supper to believe what God re∣veals, receive what he offers, and do what he com∣mands, must be absolutely <HI>null and void,</HI> destitute of all <HI>binding force.</HI>—Jesuitical equivocation and mental reservation are no more necessary in the making of promises, covenants or vows, or in swearing promis∣sory oaths of allegiance, fidelity or witness bearing; or in subscribing Articles, Creeds or Confessions of Faith, Calls to ministers, Bonds or Bills of service or debt.—If the law of God, which is exceeding broad can but reach to the matter of them, and require the believing, maintaining or practising of what is therein engaged, that alone renders them <HI>null and void, and not binding</HI> to all intents, and purposes. And so there can be no such a thing as <HI>perjury, perfidy,</HI> or <HI>breach of promise,</HI> except it be with respect to such things as the law of God could not directly or indirect∣ly reach,—which if it be as perfect and exceeding broad as the Bible affirms, must certainly be very few and very trisling;—for <HI>where there is no law,</HI>—no binding of a law,—<HI>there can be no transgression.</HI>—Mens promi∣ses, covenants, oaths and vows, in word or writ, in so far as they respect things to which the law of God can reach, must be mere <HI>villainous impositions,</HI> seeming <HI>to bind,</HI> while they do not, in the smallest degree; and therefore ought to be detested, instead of being requir∣ed, made, or trusted.—For the same reason, no com∣mands of parents, masters, magistrates, or any other superiors being <HI>human deeds,</HI> can have any <HI>binding force</HI> in any thing relative to religion, equity, kindness, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to which the law of God can reach its requirements, and hence cannot be <HI>lawfully</HI> OBEYED, or their autho∣rity regarded, except when they commend what is <HI>ab∣solutely indifferent and trisling.</HI>—If human engage∣ments and commands can only bind men to that which
<PB N="155" REF="155"/>
is <HI>absolutely indifferent,</HI> it is plain, that we can only be answerable to men for such parts of our conduct as the law of God did not reach;—but, let men once firmly believe, that their promises, covenants, oaths or vows, and the commands of superiors, have <HI>no bin∣ding force,</HI> but in that which is left absolutely indiffe∣rent by the law of God; and that they are answerable to men only for such parts of their conduct as the law of God could not reach,—how naturally they will rush headlong into all manner of profligacy, every man doing that which is right in his own eyes, in every thing important. (3) How absurd to pretend honouring of religion, or of the law of God by making it the murderer of that <HI>deputed authority</HI> which God hath, by it, granted to men; or of these covenants, oaths or vows, which He hath therein appointed as means of his worship—Not only scripture, but even common sense dictates, that the authority of God in his law cannot be rightlyregarded, unless in a way of also regard∣ingthat authority which he hath deputed to men, and all the commands or self engagements which proceed from it, in due subordination to it. If I read my Bible daily, in obedience to the command of God as my God in Christ,—in obedience to Christ as appointed by God to be my mediatorial, prophet and king,—and at the same time in due subordination hereto,—in obedience to my civil ruler, as the minister of God for good to men,—in obedience to my pastor or church judicature as the messenger of Christ to me,—in obedience to my parents or masters as God's deputy-governors over me,—and in fulfilment of the vow, which I as God's de∣puty-governor over myself, have laid myself under, according to his appointment, Where is the inconsis∣tency? Must I wickedly put asunder the <HI>immediate</HI> and <HI>deputed</HI> authority of God, which he hath so closely and delightfully joined together? God forbid.</P>
<P>OBJECT. VII. <Q REND="inline">"What have we to do with our fa∣ther's engagements in religion, to which we never gave any personal consent, especially after we have become capable to judge and choose for ourselves,—nay to do with engagements, which I cannot prove my ancestors ever took."</Q> ANSW. (1.) To rest obligation to pay debt or perform duty on the <HI>debtor's</HI> proving the contraction of it, or engagement to it, is highly ab∣surd
<PB N="156" REF="156"/>
in itself, and opens a wide door for breaking through almost every engagement. According to this scheme you may hold your ancestors, who lived 130 years ago unbaptized Heathens and perhaps yourself too, and so renounce your baptism, because you <HI>can∣not prove</HI> that ever you received it. If God, who is our <HI>creditor</HI> in these covenants, can prove our ances∣tors taking of them, he will hold us bound by their deed; and even though they did not take them, he will hold us bound by the deed of the society and its representatives. (2.) You know, that Lord —, about four hundred years ago, granted your ancestor, the valuable estate of —, to be held under him and his heirs, for a very small honorary service, as an ac∣knowledgment of vassalage; and that the celebrated farmer <HI>A. B.</HI> about six years ago took a ninety-nine years lease of one of your farms at a very high rent. Have you certified the present heirs of that Lord and Farmer, That they are no-wise bound by their proge∣nitors deeds, unless they have given their own personal consent,—and that the one may recal your estate, and the other may keep your farm, and refuse to pay you any rent?—You have not, nor ever will You al∣low such freedoms only to be used with God,—not with yourself;—too strong a presumption, That you more value your estate and rent, than all that you hold of God in religion, and all the honour you owe to him. (3.) If our fathers bound us to any thing in religion which is not warranted by the word of God, we have nothing to do with it, but to bewail their sin in such engagement. But, if they bound us to what is commanded by the law of God, we must stand bound,—till we prove from scripture, that vows binding to duty are not lawful; or that fathers have no right to devote their children to God's service. No slothful or wilful ignorance or withholding of personal con∣sent, can so much as excuse the non-performance of such engagements. Nothing can free from their <HI>binding force,</HI> which would not annual our baptismal vows. (4) Once more, Sir, be pleased to review these public covenants of our fathers, in their princi∣pal contents and meaning. They were a <HI>solemn acqui∣escence</HI> in and <HI>confirmation</HI> of God's grant of the utmost ends of the earth to his Son Jesus Christ for hs posses∣sion.
<PB N="157" REF="157"/>
They implied a <HI>solemn acceptance</HI> of God him∣self in Christ as the God, Saviour and portion of the covenanters and their posterity freely granted to them in the gospel,—and of his oracles and ordinances as the means of familiar fellowship with Him,—a <HI>resolution</HI> through his grace to retain him and them, as their inestimable privileges,—and a <HI>solemn engagement,</HI> thank∣fully to improve these privileges in an holy obedience to all his commandments, to promote his glory, and the temporal, spiritual and eternal advantage of these covenanters and their seed. Now, Sir, do you so heartily envy our Redeemer his Father's grant of the ends of the earth for his possession, Psal. ii. 8. that you would gladly renounce our ancestors solemn ac∣quiescence in it? Do do you so heartily dislike the hav∣ing of a reconciled God in Christ for your and your posterity's God, Saviour and portion, and his pure o∣racles and ordinances for your privileges, that you would fondly renounce a solemn acceptance of God's gracious grant of them sealed and consirmed by the re∣markable influences of his Spirit? Do you so under∣value these enjoyments, and hate a grateful and self-profiting obedience to all the commandments of God, that you would gladly renounce a solemn obligation to it? Or, are you offended with the declared ends of these covenants, <HI>viz.</HI> the glorifying of God, the pre∣servation and reformation of religion and promoting the welfare of the nation,—and that God may delight to dwell among us to the latest posterity?—You will perhaps pretend, that you love our reformed doctrine. worship, Presbyterian government and discipline; but hate to be bound to them, especially by others than yourself. But, Sir, for the same reason you must re∣nounce your baptismal engagements, and state your quarrel with God himself, who hath appointed vows. as his ordinance for hedging up men to their duty, and who hath entered into covenants with parents for their posterity as well as for themselves. Moreover, it is scarce credible, that you can love every thing engaged to in a vow, and yet hate to be bound by it, after God hath signally countenanced it. It is scarce possible, that my wife can dearly love her husband, and the or∣der and enjoyments of my family, if she hate and wish to renounce her marriage Vow.</P>
